      "content": "TLN: Hey, it's been a while since my last translation. I've been looking for a novel I'd like to translate. And then, I found this.\nMonica Everett, who had been lying asleep on her desk with a pen in her right hand and a stack of papers in her left, woke up to the morning light streaming in through the window.\nApparently, she had left the curtains open and fallen asleep again.\nIt is always the case that when you are absorbed in calculations, the details of daily life become neglected. The fact that she had forgotten to close the curtains meant that she had been absorbed in her work from before the sun went down until she fell asleep yesterday.\nAs she lazily sat up and rubbed her eyes, she noticed a thread of ink on the side of her hand. She put her hand to her cheek, wondering what it might be, and a boisterous voice sounded from above her head.\n\"Monica, you're in trouble! There's a weird pattern appearing on your face! It must be the curse of the dark dragon. Anyone who suffers from this curse will have those cursed patterns spread all over their body and they will die after lying around for three days and three nights! I saw it written in a book I read the other day!\"\nMonica moved her eyes, still sleepily, looked up at the owner of the boisterous voice.\nGlittering golden eyes gazed down at Monica on the ceiling beams where the sunlight never reached. Blinking a few times, she could vaguely see the outline of a black cat blending into the darkness.\n\"…Nero, you know, this isn't a curse or anything…\"\nMonica lifted the paper she was halfway through writing the formula on and brought it up to her face level.\nHolding the paper next to her cheek, the same pattern laid out as if it were a mirror image.\n\"I just fell asleep lying on top of a formula I was writing, and this is just some ink on my face…\"\nWhen Monica waved the formula paper in the air, Nero, the black cat who had been looking down on her from the ceiling beam, nimbly jumped onto the desk.\nNero wasn't just a black cat. He was Monica's familiar and understood human language. He also recently learned to read, so while Monica was engrossed in her formula he would spend his time reading entertaining novels.\nNero looked up at Monica from the desk and said rudely, \"You are such an idiot.\"\n\"Actually, the curse of the dark dragon can be lifted with a kiss from the fairy prince. Shall I try it out on you?\"\n\"You are not a fairy, Nero… Mm… I'm going to wash my face…\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nGoing around the back of the house, Monica moved her small body diligently to draw water from the well.\nRecently, the development of plumbing technology has been making significant progress, and not only in the big cities but also in the villages around here. However, this cabin located in the middle of the mountain was, as expected, not equipped with tap water.\nMonica, who had grown up in the city, found it inconvenient at first, but lately, she had gotten used to living in the mountains. The best thing is that it's quiet and uncrowded.\nAfter getting a tub of water for drinking, Monica went back inside the cabin and looked at the figure in the corner of the room as if she had just remembered.\nSomeone had told her to mind her appearance a little bit, and she had been forced to bring in a dresser, which was quite magnificent for this shabby hut.\nUnlike mirrors made of polished bronze, this beautiful mirror was made of tinned glass—not to mention its size was of a full-length mirror, which's a very expensive item. If a thief were to break into this cabin, this mirror would be the first thing he would take.\nIn such a splendid mirror, the image shown was of a skinny, petite girl with shaggy hair. Compared to her actual age of seventeen, her poor body was pale and looked like a dead person. Her light brown hair, plaited in two, was dry and shabby, more coarse than a bundle of straw. Her eyes, underneath her overgrown bangs, were covered with dark circles. Now that she thought about it, she realized that she hadn't slept at all the night before last.\nAt least she needs a cup of coffee to clear her head.\nMonica took a can of coffee beans from her desk, which was buried in a stack of papers, and coarsely poured them into the mill.\nMaking sure that the scale was set to fine grind, Monica turned the handle around and around.\nAmused by the scene, Nero jumped up on the desk and looked at her.\n\"I have always wondered why people with weak stomachs want to eat so many strange foods… Those beans are the ones you roast until they turn black, right? They are very bitter, aren't they? Do they taste good?\"\n\"It's delicious.\"\nWith that, Monica took out a metal pot.\nThe teapot was longer and narrower than most teapots, and it split in two at the center.\nFirst, pour water into the lower part of the pot, which is divided into upper and lower parts, then set a funnel with a metal filter on top of it. Put the finely ground coffee beans in there until they become powdery, and set the top of the pot firmly on the bottom.\nMonica lifted the pot and looked at the poorly constructed stone fireplace. With just that, a thin fire blazed inside the stove.\nThe unnaturally long and thin fire, unlike the fire that was ignited by a tinder made of wood, was the result of spell.\nMonica put the metal pot on the fire and took some nuts out of the cupboard and popped them into her mouth. There were very few nuts left in the preserved food.\nSince it is now the end of summer, the forest will be full of nuts in another month. Once that happens, she could ask Nero to help her pick some nuts.\nAs she was absentmindedly thinking about this, the metal pot which was on the fire made a gurgling sound. Monica put out the fire with one look and poured the contents of the pot into a tin mug.\nHere in the Ridill Kingdom, coffee is not a very common drink. There are a few coffee houses in the capital, but they are basically for men to enjoy. Women do not like coffee very much. They generally prefer black tea.\nMonica likes to drink coffee because of her late father's influence. This special metal pot was also specially made by her father, who had asked a craftsman to make it for her. Now, it is a treasured memento of her father.\nMonica huffed and puffed into the tin mug and sipped at its contents.\nAlthough the bitterness is strong, the coffee is brewed in a short time and has a clean taste without any bitterness. The best thing about it is that it helps her awaken from her drowsiness.\n\"Monica, I'd like to try some of that too.\"\nNero scurried around the desk, begging Monica for coffee.\nMonica dribbled some of the coffee that was left at the bottom of the cup onto a spoon and placed it in front of Nero.\nShe shouldn't give coffee to cats, but Nero is not a normal cat, so it will be fine… perhaps.\n\"You just said it was bitter.\"\n\"You know, any creature that forgets its sense of adventure would make them goes on degenerating.\"\n\"…that's what the book said?\"\n\"Oh, I like Dustin Günther a lot.\"\nNero licked the coffee off his spoon as he mentioned the name of a novelist who was popular in the capital.\nAs soon as he did, all the hair on his body stood on end.\n\"Hongyarabubbo———!\"\nNero let out a mewling sound that neither human nor cat would have made, and rolled around on the desk. As expected, it didn't suit his tongue.\nNero let out a ragged breath like a warrior who has just returned from the dead and looked up into Monica's face.\n\"It tasted too stimulating for my adventurous taste buds. Your taste buds must be crazy to be able to drink this.\"\n\"……\"\nMilk and sugar would have made it easier to drink, but both of those are precious in this mountain.\nMonica suddenly remembered that today was the day she was supposed to have her monthly supplies delivered.\nMonica, who is very shy and does not like to go shopping in stores, has been asking people from the village at the foot of the mountain to deliver food and other supplies to her. One of those items could be milk.\nAs for sugar… it was impossible to get refined white sugar, but they may share honey with you if you ask for it. Beekeeping is very popular in this region, and honey is relatively easy to get.\nThe combination of honey and coffee is a matter of taste, but it would probably suit Nero's taste better.\nWith these thoughts in mind, there was a knock at the door of the cabin as she was washing the pot.\n\"Monica, I'm here to deliver your goods!\"\n\"You got a visitor. Guess I'll be pretending to be a cat. Meow.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nNodding to Nero, Monica opened the door with trepidation.\nThere was a cart in front of the door, and a girl of about ten years old was standing in front of it.\nShe is a feisty-looking girl with dark brown hair tied behind her neck. She is a girl from a village near here, and her name is Annie.\nThis girl was the one who delivered the goods to Monica.\nMonica peeked out a little from behind the door and said, \"H-Hello,\" with a jittery look on her face. Annie was used to Monica's attitude, and after unloading the goods from the cart, she pushed Monica away and opened the door.\n\"Let's get your stuff inside. You can help me with the door.\"\n\"O-okay…\"\nMonica gave a small, jittery nod, and Annie briskly carried the goods inside.\nThe cabin where Monica lives has very little furniture, but the table and floor are cluttered with stacks of papers and books, and there is no place to step. Her bed was already filled with papers, and she couldn't even lie down on it. That's why Monica had recently made it a habit to sleep on a chair.\n\"Your house is terrible as usual! So tell me, is this bundle of paper important? Should I throw it away?\"\n\"A-All of them is important!\"\nAnnie looked at the stack of papers occupying the floor with suspicious eyes.\n\"Hey, these are formulas, right? What exactly are you trying to calculate?\"\nAnnie can read, and being the daughter of a craftsman, she is good with numbers. She is only a little over ten years old, but she is a smart girl compared to other children her age.\nEven for Annie, it seemed that what was written here was just a series of numbers that she could not understand.\nMonica turned over and answered while avoiding eye contact with Annie.\n\"Well, that one… is a formula for calculating the orbits of stars.\"\n\"Then what's this? It's got a lot of plant names on it.\"\n\"It is… for calculates and tabulates the fertilizer mix for plants…\"\n\"Then how about this? Are those magic letters? Somehow it's kind of similar to it…\"\n\"I-It was a new formula for a complex spell that was proposed by Professor Minerva…\"\nAnnie's eyes widened as she fiddled with the sleeves of her bulky robe and whispered back to Monica.\n\"Spell formula? You can use spellcraft, Monica?\"\n\"Um, well, that's…\"\nMonica stammered, her gaze wandering left and right.\nNero, who was pretending to be asleep on the shelf, meowed as if to say, \"Hey, hey, are you okay?\"\nWhen Monica was forever fidgeting and kneading her fingers, Annie lightly coughed and laughed.\n\"Of course, there's no way you could use spellcraft. If you could use it, you wouldn't be living in seclusion in the mountains, but working in the capital instead.\"\nSpellcraft──By using some method, it can achieve some phenomenon to create miracles.\nIt used to be a secret technique monopolized by the aristocracy, but in recent years, the common people have been given the opportunity to learn it.\nEven so, to enter an academy to learn spellcraft, you need to have a certain amount of wealth or talent, and it's not something that anyone can easily learn.\nIf someone from the common people had become a magician, that would be considered a big success.\nFor example, a senior magician can get a job in the Magical Corps, which is the most popular type of magician.\nAnd a mid-level magician or higher can work for a specialized institution for magic research or as a servant for a noble family.\nEven if one were to live as a researcher, it would be natural to conduct research in a place with splendid facilities in the royal capital, not in a shabby cabin deep in the mountains like this.\nAnnie was right in pointing out that Monica, who lived in a cabin deep in the mountains, could not possibly be a magician.\n\"Hey, have you heard, Monica? Three months ago, the eastern border was attacked by a dragon.\"\nMonica's shoulders twitched under her cape, and Nero, who had been pretending to be asleep on the shelf, opened one eye.\nNero's tail, dangling slackly beneath the shelf, swished like the pendulum of a clock.\n\"A large number winged dragon has appeared in a flock in the village! I heard there were more than ten of them!\"\nAs the name suggests, the winged dragon is a dragon with wings. They are a lower-ranking species of the dragon with low intelligence, but they are very formidable in packs. They often target livestock, but in the past few years, it has not been uncommon for starving winged dragons to attack humans.\n\"And then! And then! The one who was leading that group of winged dragons was… a legendary black dragon! The infamous Black Dragon of Wogan!\"\nAmong dragons, those titled with a color in their names are called the higher species and are considered especially dangerous. The most dangerous of them all is the black dragon.\nThe special flame breathed out by the black dragon, the black flame, is a forbidden flame that mercilessly burns through the defensive boundaries of high-ranking magicians. Once the black dragon goes on a rampage, it is not surprising that the country will turn into scorched earth. Truly, a dangerous creature worthy of legend.\n\"So! I heard that the Dragon Knights went to defeat the Black Dragon, and one of them was accompanied by one of the Seven Sages! Oh, you know what the Seven Sages are? They're the top seven magicians in this country. Anyway, they're amazing magicians.\"\n\"H-Heh…\"\n\"The youngest of the Seven Sages, the Silent Witch! She single-handedly shot down all the winged dragons and not only that, but she also killed the Black Dragon of Wogan!\"\nFor a rural village, this kind of gossip is a valuable form of entertainment.\nAnnie's eyes were already sparkling with excitement… but Monica was far from it. To be honest, she felt like throwing up a little.\n\"The Silent Witch is the only magician in existence who uses \"Chantless Spell\"! Normally, chanting is required for spellcraft, but the Silent Witch doesn't need to chant at all! She can use powerful magic without chanting!\"\nMonica silently held her stomach which was hurt as if it was being squeezed.\nEven though it was a pleasant early summer morning, Monica was drenched in sweat all over.\n\"I wish I could see them just once. The real Seven Sages.\"\nIn the countryside like this, it's rare to see a magician, let alone one of the Seven Sages. That's probably why Annie has something close to longing for a magician.\nHolding her aching stomach, Monica pulled a leather bag from the shelf and took out a few silver coins from it. She took out a few silver coins from the leather bag, which she used to pay for the goods brought to her and to pay Annie's wages.\n\"T-Thanks for… a-always… bringing me t-these goods…\"\nThanking her, Monica placed the silver coin in Annie's hand.\nAnnie counted the number of silver coins and tilted her head.\n\"You're giving me this much as usual? That's almost twice the amount of goods you have here.\"\n\"S-since you're delivering it to me… you can keep the extra… as your allowance, Annie.\"\nMost children would have been happy to put the coins in their pockets, but Annie was a smart girl.\nAnnie looked up at Monica with probing eyes at the undeserved reward.\n\"What kind of a job does Monica do?\"\n\"Um… Accounting?\"\n\"You're a professor of mathematics?\"\n\"I guess… it's… something… like that… yeah…\"\nThe piles of documents filed in here were all distinct.\nIn addition to the orbits of the stars and the blending of fertilizers, there are all kinds of data on demographics, tax revenues, product sales, and all sorts of other numbers that are lined up in this cabin in a seemingly disorderly fashion—according to an order that only Monica can understand.\nAnnie seemed to be reasonably satisfied with the \"a professor of mathematics\" explanation.\n\"Hmm, so the person who came to our village yesterday is also a professor of mathematics.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Someone who said he was your colleague came to our village. He wanted to go to your house, so I gave him directions. I'm sure he'll be here soon.\"\n—Colleague.\nAt that comment, Monica's face paled.\nMonica asked Annie in a muffled voice, her body shaking beneath her oversized robe.\n\"W-W-What kind o-o-o-o-of person… i-i-i-i-is he?\"\n\"It's me.\"\nA clear voice rang out behind Monica.\nMonica's throat hitched.\nWhen she turned around, there was a beautiful man with lustrous chestnut hair in braids, leaning against the door and smiling. Beside him was a blonde beauty in a maid's uniform.\nThe man is wearing a fine frock coat, a walking stick, and a pair of glasses. From every angle, he looks like a refined and elegant man. Above all, he had a thin, feminine face that would make most women swoon.\nBut as though Monica had encountered an evil dragon, she peeled her eyes open and desperately swallowed her scream.\n\"Aa, A-a-a-a, Lo-lo-lo-lo, louis… is-san… Hiieek!?\"\n\"Can you please not make up funny names for people, like Lololo Lowlowis?\"\n\"Hiiieek, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!\"\nThe man smiled at Annie, not paying attention to the half-frozen Monica. He then took the girl's hand and placed a candy bar on it.\n\"Thanks for showing me the way and being so helpful, young lady.\"\n\"It's my pleasure.\"\nAnnie smiled and gave a ladylike bow to the beautiful young man, and tossed a candy bar into her pocket.\n\"Okay, I don't want to interrupt your work, so I'll be going now. Bye-bye, Monica. See you in a month!\"\nWith that, Annie left the hut, her gait more ladylike than usual.\nAs she listened hopelessly to the rattle of the cart pulling away, Monica looked up at the man in front of her with tears in her eyes.\nHe mimics himself with a frock coat and a walking stick, but he is really a magician wearing a long robe and cloak and clutching a magnificent staff. The beautiful woman in a maid's uniform behind him is his contracted spirit.\n\"I-It's been a while… Louis-san.\"\nOnce she greeted him in a shaky voice, Louis placed his right hand on his chest and bowed gracefully.\n\"Yes, it's been a while. One of the Seven Sages—the Silent Witch, Miss Monica Everett.\"\nTOC | Next\nTwitter Facebook Like this:LikeLoading...",

      "content": "———What is the difference between \"magic\" and \"spellcraft\"?\nThis is a basic problem that any aspiring magician will see at least once in their life.\nTo put it simply, magic is \"making some phenomenon happen by exercising mana\", while spellcraft is achieving that phenomenon by using a method. And the method of using mana can be called a spell.\nA spell refers to exercising mana by weaving a magical formula through chanting.\nIn the first place, magic is not the exclusive domain of humans. Spirits, dragons, and the now endangered species known as magical beasts and demons also can manipulate mana. They are born with a natural ability to manipulate mana, so they do not need to go through the process of \"weaving\" a formula. That's why chanting is not necessary.\nFor example, dragons, depending on their species, can fly freely in the sky and breath fire from their mouths.\nBoth of these phenomena are caused by mana, but do dragons bother to chant when they fly or breathe fire?\nThe answer is no. Dragons do not need chanting because their race is proficient in manipulating mana.\nSo, only humans, the only beings who cannot use magic without composing a magic formula by chanting.\nIn short, humans unable to use magic without chanting.\nHowever, there is one genius girl who made the impossible possible.\nHer name is Monica Everett, a shy girl who can't talk to people properly and has shut herself away deep in the mountains, and one of the Seven Sages, the [Silent Witch].\nSpellcraft can be classified into three categories: advanced, intermediate, and lower level, with advanced spell taking 20 to 30 seconds, intermediate spell taking 10 to 20 seconds, and lower-level spell generally taking 3 to 10 seconds to chant.\nWhile not every magic formula, Monica can perform about 80% of the techniques without chanting.\nThe biggest weakness of magicians is that they become defenseless while chanting. So, it goes without saying that the time spent chanting can be the difference between life and death on the battlefield.\nSome advanced magicians use shortened chanting (quick spell) to cut their chanting time in half, but even so, Monica is the only one who can do chantless (no spells).\nThat's why, two years ago, at the mere age of fifteen, Monica Everett was chosen as one of the Seven Sages, the highest level of magicians in the country.\nThis is a very simple and straightforward story of how such a genius girl came to master Chantless Spell.\nBeing extremely bashful and shy, Monica was unable to speak properly in public.\nIt's still better when she's dealing with Annie, but when she's in front of someone she didn't know or the type of person she didn't like, she would become so convulsed that she couldn't even speak. In the worst case, she would either throw up or collapse. Of course, chanting was something she would never be able to do.\nAt the time, Monica was on the verge of dropping out of school after failing her practical exam due to her inability to chant.\nThen Monica thought about it.\nShe was too nervous to chant in front of the examiner. Then, why can't she just use her magic without chanting?\nNormally, she would have tried to overcome her shyness and aggression, but Monica's ideas took off in a completely different direction, and to everyone's surprise, her talent blossomed.\nAnd so, for a rather trivial and not at all inspiring reason, Monica mastered the Chantless Spell and became one of the Seven Sages in no time at all.\nIndeed, her effort has completely ended in an unexpected direction.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nCalming her shaking hands, Monica made the coffee using the same procedure as in the morning and placed it gently in front of her guest.\n\"P-P-Please h-have a d-drink.\"\n\"That's an unusual extraction method, isn't it? Thanks for the drink.\"\nThe beautiful-looking guest sat down on the chair Monica had prepared for him while sipping his coffee. As for his maid, she was standing behind him\nHis thin eyebrows furrowed and his purple-gray eyes glared at Monica behind his spectacles.\n\"This bitter coffee seems to have been boiled down with malice, is meant to harass me?\"\n\"Hiiiieeek, I-I-I-I'm s-s-s-sorrryyyy!\"\n\"I've traveled a long way to the depths of the mountains, and now I'm being treated like this. Isn't this just a bit exessive?\"\nThis man, who is a co-worker of Monica, is also one of the Seven Sages.\nHis name was Louis Miller, the Barrier Magician. He was twenty-seven years old, ten years older than Monica, but since he became one of the Seven Sages at the same time as Monica, he often got the same treatment as her.\nLouis was a handsome man who looks delicate when he's not talking, but he is also an extremely fierce magician who boasts the second-highest record for killing dragons alone. He has also served as the leader of the Magic Corps and was feared by the members of the Corps for his shrewdness.\nAnyway, it would be horrible to make him angry, so when Monica placed the glass of water in front of Louis, she was trembling with fear.\n\"U-um… M-May I a-ask what y-your business is t-today?\"\nLouis took a sip from his glass of water and turned his attention to the woman in the maid's uniform standing behind him.\n\"Lynn… put up a soundproof barrier.\"\n\"Certainly.\"\nThe moment the maid called Lynn nodded her head, the sounds in the area around the cabin suddenly disappeared.\nThe sound of the wind, birds singing, and all other sounds from the outside are isolated from the inside of the cabin.\nNero, who was pretending to be asleep on the shelf, shivered his beard uncomfortably and looked at the woman in the maid's uniform with golden eyes.\nShe was a tall, slender, beautiful woman. However, her well-formed face was expressionless and somewhat doll-like.\nThe reason why she was able to set up a ward without chanting was, precisely that she was not a human but a high-ranking spirit. There were only about ten magicians in the whole kingdom who have high-ranking spirits as their followers.\nIn other words, having a high-ranking spirit as your follower was a kind of status for a magician.\n\"Miss Monica, why don't you make a contract with a high-ranking spirit? I think that would help you gain some credibility.\"\n\"I-I have… a-already got an excellent familiar with me.\"\nNero on the shelf wagged his tail, nodding his head in approval.\nLouis took one look at Nero on the shelf and snickered as if he had noticed Nero's presence.\n\"It's quite a cute little familiar.\"\nAt his somewhat mocking murmur, Nero made a clear \"meow\" sound.\n\"Well, anyway, let's get down to business. I've come here today to ask you for a favor.\"\n\"…a-a favor?\"\nWhen Monica made no attempt to hide her wariness, Louis smiled graciously, crossed his white-gloved hands, and rested his chin on them.\n\"Yes, actually, I've been guarding the second prince in secret for the past month under the orders of His Majesty.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nLouis's words made Monica widen her eyes.\nIn this country, there were three princes with different mothers.\nPrince Lionel, who was twenty-seven years old, Prince Felix, who was eighteen years old, and Prince Albert, who was fourteen years old—as to which of the three would become the next king, the nobles in the country have different perspectives.\nMonica was not interested in this kind of power struggle, so she only knew about it from what she heard from others, but according to rumors, the first and second prince factions were almost equal in number, and the third prince faction was slightly outnumbered.\nAmong the Seven Sages, there were those from the First Prince faction and those from the Second Prince faction. And this \"Barrier Magician,\" Louis Miller, was a prime example of the First Prince faction.\nSo why was that Louis has been ordered to guard the second prince? Monica's eyebrows furrowed in discomfort.\n\"U-Um… Louis-san, you're, from the First Prince's faction, aren't, you?\"\n\"Yes, so why did His Majesty give me an order to become the second prince's personal guard? I have some thoughts about it, but it would be inappropriate to speculate about His Majesty's will, so let's not do that here. What's important is that His Majesty ordered me to protect the Second Prince without being noticed.\"\nNot to mention how difficult it is to protect a person without the target noticing.\nWhy did the king give an order to Louis, a member of the First Prince faction, to protect the Second Prince?\nWhy does it need to be kept unnoticed by the second prince?\nTo Monica's confusion, Louis continued his words without hesitation.\n\"As I mentioned earlier, His Highness Felix is currently attending Serendia Academy, a prestigious boarding school. So, in order to protect his highness without him noticing… Well, it would be reasonable to infiltrate the school, but that school is under the control of the Duke of Crockford, so it would difficult.\"\nDuke Crockford, the maternal grandfather of the second prince, and was one of the most powerful men in the country and the leader of the second prince's faction. To put it simply, he and Louis were like water and oil.\nIt was unlikely that Louis would cooperate to become his secret bodyguard.\n\"T-Then how are you going to protect him if you can't get into the school?\"\n\"That's why I've prepared him this magic tool for self-defense.\"\nLouis pulled a small cloth package from his pocket and placed it on the desk.\nWrapped in a cloth was a shattered brooch. The large ruby in the center of the brooch was cracked, and the finely crafted goldwork on the clasp was cracked wide open.\nWhen Louis picked up the ruby, she noticed that there was a magic circle engraved on the base. The moment Monica saw the magic circle, she knew what it was.\n\"A-A barrier consisting of danger detection, a small area of physical and magical protection, and a transmission…\"\n\"I'm impressed that you can see through it with just one glance. Yes, this is a magic tool for self-defense that I have painstakingly made.\"\nMagic tools are very useful for those who cannot use magic. It could be used just by adding mana to specially processed jewels and incorporating magic formulas. But, these items still considered as a very high-class item, so it's not available in the current market.\nOn top of that, it was made by the Seven Sages, the best magicians in this country, which made it can't be measured. In fact, even if it was inferior, it would be enough to buy two or three houses in the capital.\nLouis picked up a cracked ruby and looked through it at the sunlight streaming in through the window. Then, a magic circle appeared in the cracked ruby.\n\"I made this brooch in a pair, which is of sapphires and rubies. The holder of the sapphire brooch would get a protective barrier when they attacked. So I have asked His Majesty to make sure that His Highness Felix carries this brooch around with him.\"\nAs such, Louis always kept the ruby brooch, the counterpart to the sapphire, close at hand to check for any danger to the prince.\nIn the first place, Serendia Academy itself was strictly controlled by Duke Crockford. Any malicious person who wanted to take the prince's life would not be able to easily break in.\nSo, it's unlikely that this will happen very often, and Louis seems to have had a high opinion of it.\n\"However, this magic tool, which I put my heart and soul into and worked tirelessly on for a week, broke down within three days of its completion.\"\n\"I-In just three days…\"\n\"Yes, I heard that it shattered the day after His Majesty presented it to His Highness Felix. I had been working tirelessly for a week, but it took me three days to complete it. Well, when I saw the ruby brooch break, I laughed because it was so hilarious, hahaha!\"\nHis laugh was incredibly strained, and his eyes were not smiling at all.\nNo, it was no laughing matter, to begin with. The fact that the ruby brooch in Louis' hand was broken meant that the second prince was in some kind of danger.\n\"I-Is, the second prince, safe?\"\n\"When the magic tool was activated, I rushed to the school as soon as I could to check if anything had happened to His Highness, but… His Highness was nonchalant and said nothing had happened. As for the breakage of the magic tool… he said it may have been a malfunction.\"\nIn Louis' hand, the ruby made a hard snapping sound. Fragments of the ruby spilled out from between his slender fingers. Scary.\n\"I don't believe something that I had created will have some defect. It's obvious that His Highness Felix was attacked by someone. However, His Highness Felix is hiding it.\"\nThings were finally starting to get a little fishy.\nShe has a bad feeling about this. A very bad feeling.\nLouis scattered the shattered remains of the ruby on the desk and turned to Monica with a graceful smile that didn't match his ridiculous power.\n\"Well, now that I've said that, you should know what I'm about to say right?\"\nMonica shook her head as hard as she could. Her straw-like pigtails bobbed left and right.\nHowever, Louis just didn't care about Monica's attitude and said with a smile.\n\"Please do me a favor and go infiltrate the academy to protect His Highness.\"\nDespite sounding like he was asking for a handkerchief, what he was saying was a ridiculously difficult task.\n\"N-N-No way! T-T-T-That's impossible! W-Why it has to be me!?\"\n\"Why? Because of my popularity, it will get in the way. Look at my good looks. No matter how much I disguise myself, I can't hide it. On the other hand, you were never going out to social gatherings or ceremonies. Even when you did, you would always wear a hood and keep your head down, so your face is not known. And the most important is…\"\nLouis lifted Monica's chin with his slender fingertips, smiled enchantingly, and said.\n\"Nobody would think such plain little girl like you is one of the Seven Sages.\"\nWhat he said was a rant.\nNero on the shelf said, \"Don't let him denounce you! Give him a good scolding!\" Nero on the shelf spoke to her with his gaze, but Monica was too timid to retort, \"It's impossible!\"\n\"I… I've never been involved in protecting anyone before…\"\n\"That would be better.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nMonica's tears stopped for a moment at the unexpected words.\nLouis removed his fingers from Monica's chin and let out a sigh with a pensive look on his face.\n\"His Highness has very good intuition, you see…When I secretly put a person from the Magic Corps as an escort, he immediately saw right through him. His Highness has been surrounded by guards since a child, so he's quite adept at spotting them. That's why you are the best person for this job.\"\nLouis then looked straight at Monica and said with a refreshing smile.\n\"Even His Highness doesn't think that an amateurish little girl would be his personal guard.\"\n\"……\"\n\"What's more, with your Chantless Spell, you can activate magic without being noticed, making you the perfect choice for his secret bodyguard, no? There is no one better suited for this job than you.\"\nWhat Louis had said was making a lot of sense, but to Monica, it looked like Louis was trying to throw a fit at the prince after his magic tool had been destroyed in just three days.\nShe was probably right. After all, Louis's eyes have been glittering with a dangerous glow for a while now. And that's the glow of a person who is really pissed off.\n\"B-But… I've never… done… a bodyguard job… I can't do it…\"\nWhen Monica desperately said that, Louis tilted his head in a playful manner and looked at the stack of papers occupying the floor.\nThen he picked up the nearest piece and shook it with a pitter-patter.\n\"It's been almost two years since you and I became the Seven Sages… For the past two years, all you've done is stay indoors facing these paper.\"\n\"I-I've also, d-defeated, a dragon, three months ago…\"\n\"I have also defeated about 20 dragons in the past three months. So?\"\nAlthough there was no clear hierarchy among the Seven Sages, Monica and Louis, who had only been appointed for a short period of time, tended to be assigned chores by them.\nFor the past two years, Louis has mainly been sent out to kill dragons, while Monica has been in charge of the paperwork. Most of the documents in this cabin were things that the other Seven Sages had asked her to calculate for them.\nLouis looked over the paper he'd picked up and squinted at it behind his spectacles.\n\"This document of star's orbit was the thing that Lady Stars Witch asked you, wasn't it? And this plant's fertilizer formula was from Lady Thorn Witch, this formula for calculating the coordinate axis for large-scale attack magic was from the Lord Artillery Magician, and these documents related to the purchase and inventory of the materials for the magic tools were from the Jewel Magician… Oh, wasn't this one about Lord Abyssal Sorcerer's family's finances? You're even forced to do this chore?\"\n\"But… that was… our job…\"\nWhen Monica squirmed and objected, Louis snorted haughtily.\n\"These are the work for an accounting or a bookkeeper. Listen, you are the Seven Sages, the top magicians in the Ridill Kingdom. Don't you think there is a job that only you can do? Don't you think so? You think, don't you? You think? Just think.\"\nHe emphasized the final sentence.\nAs Monica shivered and wobbled, Louis smiled and gave her a no-no.\n\"His Majesty has entrusted me with the selection of the Second Prince's personal guard. In other words, you have no right of refusal, right, my dear friend?\"\n\"B-But… I think… someone who specialized at barriers like you… is the best person for this protection job…\"\nThe idea of infiltrating the school of a prince, when the person in question is extremely bashful and shy, is beyond reckless.\nLet alone protecting the prince, she doesn't feel like she can spend her school life properly.\nWhen Monica desperately urged him to change his decision, Louis patted Monica on the shoulder and looked into her face at very close range.\n\"Actually, I'm a newlywed.\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"I want to get home as soon as possible for my lovely wife, so I don't want to add extra work. Now, do you understand?\"\nThe pressure of his hand on Monica's shoulder grew stronger.\n\"I'm just asking you to show some consideration, little girl.\"\nHis eyes glittered like razor blades, and Monica knew she could not escape.",

      "content": "\"In a certain monastery in the eastern part of the Kingdom of Ridill, in the territory of Count Kerbeck, there was a poor girl who had no relatives. The former Countess Kerbeck saw in this poor girl a glimpse of her late husband and adopted her as her own daughter. That girl grew up happily and was loved by former Countess Kerbeck, however, she fell ill and died in her old age. After losing her guardian, that girl was ostracized by the people of the Count's family to serve her daughter as a servant. And then, when the daughter was enrolled in Serendia Academy, a school for children of noble families, the pitiful girl was also sent to attend with her as her servant…\n…and so, your role is to be this pitiful girl, Miss Monica.\"\nAfter Louis blurted out such ridiculous background in earnest, Monica broke into a cold sweat and said in a faint voice,\n\"E-Excuse me, but… I couldn't even understand any of your explanation.\"\nHonestly, to Monica, who barely understood most of it in her head, Louis with a sly smile told her this.\n\"If you have this kind of troublesome background, nobody would bother to delve into it. Here is the book I used as a reference for.\"\nBehind Louis, Lynn, who was dressed in a maid's uniform, smoothly took out a book.\nThe author's name was Dustin Günther. He has been Nero's favorite novelist lately.\nLynn offered the book to Monica, then spoke to her in a respectful tone.\n\"This is a romance about a heroine who is bullied by Count's daughter, catches the attention of a prince, and eventually falls in forbidden love with him. Her insidious bullying tactics are very detailed and interesting.\"\nAt Lynn's explanation, Nero on the shelf wagged his tail with a curious look on his face.\nThere were several books by Dustin Günther in this cabin, but they were all old. The book in Lynn's hands, on the other hand, was his latest work. It's no wonder Nero was interested in it.\nAs Monica puzzled over the book, Lynn let her hold it gently.\n\"I will lend it to you. So feel free to use it as a reference.\"\nWhat kind of reference do you want her to take?\nMonica flipped through the pages of the book tentatively.\nWhen it comes to magic books, she can read for hours, but since she was not familiar with this kind of entertainment novel, she couldn't get the contents into her head.\nFlipping through the pages at random, she happened to find the scene where the heroine was crying in the shadows after her skirt was torn by a villainous daughter. The Count's daughter in the book was a very bad woman. Everything that she did was outrageous.\n\"Um… According to your idea, I'll be enrolled together with the daughter of Count Kerbeck, but this is…\"\n\"Oh, don't worry! I've told Count Kerbeck the details and have asked his only daughter, Young Miss Isabelle, to help.\"\nMonica turned her eyes away.\n\"Y-You even went to trouble Count of the Kerbeck Family!? W-W-With those absurd backgrounds at that!?\"\nAt any rate, if the background Louis had in mind were to be followed, Count Kerbeck and Young Miss Isabelle would have become the bad guys.\nTo Monica's concern, Louis said this with a relaxed attitude.\n\"Does the name of Count Kerbeck ring any bells?\"\n\"Huh? Um…\"\nAlthough Monica was quite skilled in calculating, she was not particularly good at remembering the names of people and places.\nNevertheless, the word \"Count Kerbeck\" stuck in Monica's memory slightly.\n\"Ah… at the dragon extermination…\"\n\"That's right. The area where you defeated the black dragon of Wogan three months ago… is the Count Kerbeck territory. The Count is deeply grateful to you. He even said he was willing to help in any way he could for the sake of Lady [Silent Witch].\"\nCount Kerbeck was very grateful to the Silent Witch and had prepared a banquet to thank her for defeating the dragon.\nHowever, Monica had turned it down and had come back to this cabin to escape. Therefore, Monica had never met either Count Kerbeck or his daughter.\nInwardly, Monica was scared, her decision to leave the party might have offended him, but Count Kerbeck took it as \"How modest Lady Silent Witch is!\"\n\"I have already informed Count Kerbeck and his daughter about it.\"\n\"A-Are you talking about… T-Those backgrounds, where I'm an adopted daughter of a former countess, who is ostracized by the count's family?\"\n\"Yes, exactly. When I told him about that background, Count Kerbeck was very excited, saying, ‘Now, doesn't that sound like a ballad?'\"\n\"H-He's excited?\"\n\"Speaking of which, Young Miss Isabelle's eyes were shining when she said, ‘So this is the villainous daughter that has been trending these days!'\"\n\"T-Trending?\"\nThe novel that Louis used as a reference book was apparently very popular in the royal capital. Being one of his biggest fans, Young Miss Isabelle even went out her way to the capital in order to obtain the newest novel.\n\"In recent days, Young Miss Isabelle is working hard on her role as the villainess who bullies you.\"\n\"……\"\n\"That's why you are going to infiltrate the school and work hard to protect the second prince while being bullied by Young Miss Isabelle. I mean, you're good at playing the role of the bullied girl, aren't you?\"\n\"……\"\nMonica was unable to respond. It was because half of her mind had gone into unconsciousness.\nIn fact, the moment Louis had obtained the cooperation of Count Kerbeck, he had no intention to let Monica escape.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nOnce Louis and Lynn withdrew from the cabin, Monica was still slumped down on the floor in a daze.\nLouis had told her to pack her things because he would pick her up tomorrow at the same hour, but honestly, she had no idea where to start.\n\"Hey, Monica. Are you alive? Hello?\"\nWhile Monica was slumped over, Nero's paw tapped on her leg.\nUnder normal circumstances, Monica would be comforted by the feel of those squishy paw pads, but she didn't have time for that now.\n\"What should I do… this is impossible… going to the aristocrats' academy… is scary… I have to be his bodyguard at that… I can't…\"\nMonica used to be enrolled in a school called Minerva, which was the best educational institution for magicians.\nIn the past, noble families had a monopoly on the knowledge of spell casting, and even today, the majority of those who aspire to become magicians were children from noble families. Most of the time, it was the children of the second son or younger who were unable to take over the family.\nHence, children born commoners who wanted to become magicians were either used as errand boys or targeted for bullying by the noble families. And Monica was the latter.\nMonica, who was very shy and always nervous and timid, was easy prey for such things.\nEspecially after she was able to use chantless spell, things had gone badly, with jealousy and envy mixed in. That's why Monica spent a lot of time in the laboratory of the professor who always took care of her, and devoted herself to the study of spell casting.\nMonica had graduated from Minerva at the age of fifteen, but she had spent most of her final year holed up in her lab, not attending classes.\nIf her professor hadn't recommended her as one of the Seven Sages, she would probably still be holed up in her lab.\nWell, even though she has become the Seven Sages, she's still holed up in her cabin like this.\n\"I can't… I can't do this… What should I do, Nero…\"\n\"How about running away?\"\nAt Nero's suggestion, Monica wobbled and shook her head, almost squirming.\n\"I-I will be… k-killed… I-If I do that…\"\n\"You sure he's going to go that far? What was his name again? Roonroon Looweessus?\"\n\"Nero… if you call his name like that… he would turn you into cat-soup.\"\nMonica covered her face with her hands and hung her head down.\nLouis Miller, the [Barrier Magician], was a pretty young man with quite an aristocratic demeanor, but he was also one of the most accomplished combat magicians in the country. Monica knew that underneath those white gloves there was a magnificent punching arm.\n\"If I run away… Louis will definitely chase me to the ends of the earth…\"\n\"Is that guy really a human? Are you not mistaken about him being a Keeper of the Underworld rather than the Seven Sages?\"\n\"That's how scary he is!\"\nMonica knew that there was no way out for her anymore. Even so, she was afraid.\nWhile Monica sniffled, Nero wagging his tail and suggested,\n\"Let's look on the bright side. You're going to be the prince's bodyguard. He's the prince, you see. He must be cool, right? He must be sparkling, right? And every female human loves such a prince, right?\"\n\"I don't know…\"\n\"As the Seven Sages, you should have attended some kind of ceremony or something, no? Then, you must have seen the prince's face before.\"\nMonica shook her head loosely.\nMonica, who was very shy and uncomfortable in crowded places, usually kept her head down with her robe pulled over her head during the ceremony and kept her breath down until the ceremony was over. She's not even got a good look at the king's face on the throne.\n\"Say, Monica. I was just thinking…\"\n\"……\"\n\"Not knowing the face of the second prince you're guarding is rather fatal, isn't it?\"\n\"What should I do now…\"\nHonestly, had she said that she didn't know what the second prince looked like, Louis Miller would probably give her a beautiful smile, shove a fist into Monica's head, and hurl all the abusive language he could think of at her.\nImagining that scene, Monica collapsed onto the floor and broke down in hollow tears.",

      "content": "TLN: I changed the term \"Lidil\" to \"Ridill.\"\nLouis Miller, the \"Barrier Magician,\" who had forced Monica to work as a bodyguard for the second prince, was staying in a village near the cabin where Monica lived.\nAfter all, it would take a whole day to get from this village to the capital by carriage. Louis exhaled a sigh, \"I can't wait to get back to my home where my beloved wife awaits.\"\nIt wasn't that he didn't like to eat in a public restaurant, but he didn't want to stand out too much right now, so he had his meals brought to a private room at the inn.\nAcross the table, his contracted spirit, Lynn, was quietly reading a book. She was a spirit with no sense of taste, so she can't accompany him to eat.\nThe cool beauty in the maid's uniform was reading a book expressionlessly, but eventually closed the book with a snap and opened her mouth.\n\"Lord Louis, I have a question.\"\n\"What is it? I'm still eating.\"\n\"Why did you ask Miss [Silent Witch] to guard the second prince?\"\nLouis was expecting a question about the content of the book, so he narrowed his eyes a little and wiped his mouth with a napkin.\n\"Give me your view, Lindsberghfield.\"\n\"In my opinion, Lord Louis, after the magic tool you put so much effort into making was destroyed in three days, you were so angry that you tried to vent your anger by taking it out on the weak-minded person, which is Miss [Silent Witch].\"\n\"What kind of a man do you think your master is?\"\n\"I have heard that he has character disorder who likes to bully the weak.\"\nWithout a moment's hesitation, his contracted spirit said this to him, and Louis was smiling with a furrowed temple.\n\"Bring the person who blurted out that assessment to you here. I will trample him thoroughly until his head sinks into the floor.\"\n\"That person was your mentor, Lord Gideon Rutherford.\"\nHis mentor, Gideon Rutherford was one of the few people he can't handle even for the proud Louis.\nLouis clicked his tongue ungracefully and shook his head in a dramatic gesture. His neat face had a sad expression on it, but his earlier remark had ruined everything.\n\"Oh, how lamentable. People have been misunderstanding about me.\"\nThe word \"misunderstanding\" that Louis said to Lynn was said in a stern manner.\n\"It is always more fun to bully the strong than to bully the weak, isn't it?\"\nThe idea was too far-fetched. Above all, He's not denying the part of his character disorder.\nLynn tilted her head with a blank expression. In the book she had just read, all the characters who had been questioned had tilted their heads in this way. This gesture, which she was simply copying, combined with her expressionless face, made her look like a doll with a broken neck.\n\"Lord Louis, when you were bullying Miis [Silent Witch], you had the face of a scumbag who enjoys bullying the weak.\"\n\"You say Miss [Silent Witch] is weak? Who are you talking about?\"\nLouis snorted at Lynn's rebuttal as if it were a mockery.\nHe gave her a graceful smile… but the eyes behind his spectacles shine brightly and somewhat belligerently.\n\"In the past, I've been completely defeated by such a little girl in the magic battle of the Seven Sages selection.\"\nAt that time, Louis Miller has more experience as a commander of the Magical Corps, specializing in fighting with spell casting.\nHaving defeated many dragons and buried more than a hundred of them, he was one of the top two combatant magicians in the country.\nBut, in a magic battle, he was totally defeated by the [Silent Witch], who was 15 years old.\n\"I, Louis Miller, the [Barrier Magician], assure you. That one's a monster.\"\nLouis emphatically proclaimed that such a little girl, who couldn't make eye contact with people, always kept her head down and was scared out of her wits, was a \"monster.\"\nLouis laced his fingers together, rested his thin chin on it, and squinted.\n\"His Majesty ordered me to secretly protect the second prince, but I can't just take His Majesty's words literally.\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"Keep a close eye on the second prince… that's what I believe His Majesty meant.\"\nThe second prince has always been an excellent person. He has excellent academic and swordsmanship skills, and even though he was still attending school, his high diplomatic skills have earned him the trust and confidence of both domestic and foreign nobles.\nAbove all, his beautiful appearance and gentle smile, inherited from his mother, have been reputed to charm the people who saw him.\nHe managed everything without a hitch and was very good at controlling people's minds.\nHe, whose grandfather was Duke Crockford, the most powerful noble in the country, was Felix Ark Ridill.\nBut no one knows his true nature.\nUnderneath his friendly, soft smile, there was something horrible stirring.\n—That was the kind of creepy feeling Louis sensed in Felix.\nHowever, whenever Louis tried to find out what the discomfort was, Felix always smoothly fend him off with a soft smile.\n\"The second prince is a very shrewd predator. Using a straightforward manner won't make him back down.\"\nThat's why Louis chose Monica as his helpers.\nThat girl who has a freakish talent that didn't match with her shy personality had made everything look a little out of place.\n\"I've told you. I like to pick on the strong.\"\n\"So what you want to say is, you want to bully both the Second Prince and Miss [Silent Witch] at the same time, which are belong to the ‘strong ones'?\"\nWithout correcting her, Louis just gave her a beautiful smile.\nIt was such a beautiful smile that most women would be charmed by, and it was no less than the second prince, but… Lynn was not particularly impressed and said matter-of-factly.\n\"I understand. I will revise my assessment of you to ‘the person with personality disorder who likes to bully the strong'.\"\n\"You should also correct the part about the personality disorder.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThe story was set back two days before Monica Everett, the [Silent Witch], broke down in tears after being forced into a task to protect the second prince.\nIn the dormitory room of Serendia Academy, one of the most prestigious schools in the Ridill Kingdom, Felix Ark Ridill, the second prince of the Ridill Kingdom, leaned back on the couch and lazily watched as his chamberlain unwrapped a gift.\nThe gift was wrapped in a package with the royal family's crest. In other words, the gift was a gift from his father, His Majesty the King. However, the look Felix gave to the gift wrapping was cold.\nAside from Felix, the only person in the room was a young man who was his chamberlain. He took out a silk-wrapped brooch from a package, inspected it, and respectfully presented it to Felix.\n\"What kind of occasion this time?\"\n\"It's a gift for your advancement to the higher grade.\"\n\"Oh…\"\nMuttering without much interest, Felix picked up the brooch with his gloved hand and held it up to the light.\nLooking through the light of the large sapphire in the center of the ring, one can see the faintest hint of magical writing behind the royal blue.\n\"As I thought, it was a magic tool. Will, do you know what kind of magic formula is built into it?\"\nFelix then placed the brooch in his hand onto the hand of the chamberlain behind him.\nThe young man, a chamberlain called Will, flickered his very light blue eyes to see the magic formula in the sapphire.\n\"I believe this magic tool had contained a defensive barrier to protect you, Your Highness.\"\n\"Are that the only effect it has?\"\n\"Actually, there are other formulas built into this. Perhaps, when the defensive barrier is triggered, it will transmit His Highness's current location to some remote location.\"\nWhen Will explained this, Felix brushed his honey blonde hair lightly and let out a sigh with a very annoyed look on his face.\n\"That would be a problem. It would be terrible if it was accidentally triggered in the middle of my night activities.\"\n\"……\"\n\"So let's do this.\"\nFelix pinned the brooch to Will's chest.\nHe then pulled out a self-defense sword from under the bed and swung it straight at the head of the bewildered chamberlain standing there.\nA white layer of light formed between Will, whose eyes were wide and rigid, and the sword Felix swung down, which caught the sword.\nOnce the layer of light disappeared, the sapphire on Will's chest cracked with a soft snap.\n\"Oh, so this is how it works.\"\nFelix put away his sword, muttering in a voice that didn't seem to be interested in it at all.\nWill removed the broken brooch from his chest and took the cracked sapphire off its pedestal. The pedestal was engraved with a very detailed magic formula.\n\"This is a combination of advanced barrier formula. It's not something that an ordinary magician can create. I think only Louis Miller, the \"Barrier Magician\", can create something like this.\"\n\"Oh…\"\nOf the Seven Sages, Felix recalled Louis Miller belonged to the First Prince faction.\nWhy did the king give Felix a magic tool made by Lewis Miller of the First Prince faction as a gift for his advancement?\n\"Come to think of it, there were some members of the Magical Corps mixed in among the cafeteria staff and the janitors… I guess they're one of Louis Miller's pawns.\"\n\"Would you like me to dispose of them?\"\n\"Yeah, just make sure it's taken care of properly. I'm sure they call it protection, but… if they start sniffing around too much, let them know they're making an enemy of the House of Crockford.\"\nThis school was under the power of Felix's grandfather, the Duke of Crockford. Even His Majesty the King can't interfere easily.\n—That's probably why the king decided to send Louis Miller.\nFelix snatched the brooch from Will's hand and rolled it around in his hand with a faint smile.\n\"Looks like His Majesty have been keeping eye on me.\"\n\"Then please refrain from playing around at night\"—those were the words that Will never said to him.\nTo Will, Felix was his master, and that's for sure.\nSo, even if his master had pinned a magic tool brooch with no idea how effective it would be, and had swung his sword down on him, he would never complain.\nFelix sat back down on the couch and gracefully crossed his legs, tossing the shattered sapphire onto the table in a careless manner.\n\"Looks like this one was defective.\"\n\"I will inform that to His Majesty.\"\nWill picked up the remnants of the brooch and rewrapped it.\nWatching this unfold, Felix let out a small sigh. He then pulled off his scarf and loosened his collar. The white nape of his neck was exposed, revealing the red remnants of his night's affair.\n\"I'm still sleepy after having returned late yesterday. I will take a nap. Wake me up when it's time for the tea party. Miss Bridget's holding a tea party today, and it would be troublesome if I ditched her.\"\nWithout waiting for Will's response, Felix closed his eyes.\nAs for Will, he bowed and said \"Certainly,\" then began silently collecting the pieces of the brooch again.",

So If you found any incorrect terms, please feel free to comment below.\nAs the carriage rattled along, Louis looked at Monica sitting across from him and opened his mouth.\n\"The first question, please answer in order from top to bottom the rank of nobility in our kingdom.\"\n\"…B, Baron, Marquis, Duke, Earl?\"\nAs Monica replied unsurely, Louis gave her a beautiful smile and called her a \"stupid girl.\"\n\"Not only does none of it correct, but also, where did the Viscount go?\"\n\"Hiien…\"\nNow, in the carriage, Louis was giving a brief lecture about nobility.\nEven though the lecture was covered on nobility, he didn't teach her how their manner or behaving.\nIn fact, before teaching her some manners, he would teach her some general knowledge.\n———And the whole thing started with a simple question from Monica.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"We will now head to my house in the royal capital. There, we will meet up with the daughter of Count Kerbeck, Young Miss Isabelle Norton, to complete the admission procedures…\"\nAfter getting into the carriage, Louis explained to Monica what they were going to do. However, Monica was more interested in what Louis was saying than what he was doing.\nThis time, Isabelle Norton, the daughter of Count Kerbeck, will be Monica's collaborator.\n\"Um, I thought Kerbeckwas a family name?\"\n\"Excuse me?\"\nMonica said that while fidgeted with her fingers to Louis, who looked as if he didn't understand what she was saying.\n\"Well, I thought her name was Isabelle Kerbeck because she was the daughter of Count Kerbeck.\"\n\"Kerbeck is their title. Those who have a title above count usually referred to by their title.\"\n\"??\"\nWhen Monica's eyes went blank, Louis felt his cheeks twitching.\n\"My colleague, how much do you know about the nobility?\"\nMonica shook her head mutely, and the smile finally disappeared from Louis's face.\nThus began Teacher Louis' (not) fun lesson on nobility.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"The first thing to do is to get this into your head. In our kingdom, the ranks of nobility are, in order from the top, duke, marquis, count, viscount, and baron. There are also quasi-aristocrats below these, but I won't go into that here. In any case, if you encounter a duke-class person, just consider him or her to be related to the royal family.\"\nWith Louis's words etched in her mind, Monica blurted out.\n\"…Count is a surprisingly high position, isn't it?\"\nTo tell the truth, Monica had thought that the lowest rank of nobility was count.\nAt Monica's murmur, Louis opened his eyes to the limit and stared at Monica as if he were looking at something incredible.\n\"My colleague? You have your own title, don't you?\"\nThe Seven Sages were granted a special status of the count of magic, which was equivalent to the rank of count.\nIn other words, Monica was a member of the nobility and was also one of the few women in the kingdom that held a title of nobility, but… for the past two years, Monica has been cooped up in her cabin, unaware of her status as a member of the nobility.\nThinking back, she did remember receiving proof of peerage, a ring, and other things when she became one of the Seven Sages, but she couldn't remember where she had put them. It was probably buried somewhere in a stack of papers in her cabin.\nWhen Monica honestly confessed that, Louis brushed his fingers over the crease between his eyebrows and exhaled deeply.\n\"To start with, let's talk about Counts. In general, a count who owns a territory receives their title directly from that territory. For example, Lord Azure Norton is Count Kerbeck, who rules over the territory of Count Kerbeck. This also applies to dukes and marquises.\"\n\"Are there some counts who have no territory?\"\n\"There are. Or rather, we are the ones, you stupid girl.\"\nCounts who did not have their own territories were referred to as count palatine. And the count of magic was one of them.\n\"In the case of a count who doesn't have a territory, you might add \"count\" to their family name. In your case, you will be called Count Everett.\"\nEven people born as commoners can receive a peerage depending on their achievements.\nAmong them, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the count of magic is the highest position they could achieve.\n\"To be honest, there are many different types of a count. There are those who are on the verge of downfall and are living the same life as commoners. They may have the same title as a count, but their influence is very different.\"\nAmong such a count, the count of magic was said to have a very high position. After all, the Seven Sages were in a position where they could directly express their opinions to His Majesty the King.\nHowever, Monica has never met the king outside of ceremonies. This was because Monica, who was basically cooped up in her mountain cabin, was absent from most of the meetings of the Seven Sages where the king would occasionally show up.\nIn principle, the Seven Sages were not obliged to show up at social gatherings, but… Since magical research would need patrons, the overwhelming majority of the Seven Sages actively involved in the social circles.\nA shut-in like Monica was a rarity.\n\"The count of magic is relatively influential among the counts, but it is a non-heredity title that holds no territory. Once you step down as one of the Seven Sages, you lose your title. That's why everyone is so eager to maintain their position.\"\n\"Are you too like that, Louis?\"\n\"Isn't that obvious?\"\nLouis answered immediately and looked at Monica with sharp, grimacing eyes.\n\"I have no intention of throwing away my current position. That's why I have to make sure this secret mission succeeds.\"\nIn the midst of the rattling carriage, Louis stretched out his arm without losing his balance and placed his finger perfectly between Monica's eyes.\n\"Failure is not an option, my colleague.\"\nThat one word had nailed Monica who was not attached to her position as count of magic in her coffin.\nIf Monica failed to protect the prince, it would also be a failure for Louis.\nIf that happens, what will Louis do to her is something she doesn't want to see…\nJust thinking about it makes me want to throw up.\nAs Monica turned pale and held her stomach, Louis said, \"Oh, are you getting carriage sickness?\" in a concerned tone.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nBy the time Monica and her group arrived at Louis' mansion in the royal capital after an early morning carriage ride, the sun of summer was beginning to set a little.\nAfter a long ride in the carriage and being drilled with knowledge about the nobility by Louis, Monica was walking unsteadily behind him. If it weren't for Lynn's support to assist her, she would have fallen to the ground long ago.\n\"Rosalie, I'm back.\"\nAs soon as Louis said this in a hearty voice, his wife, Rosalie Miller, immediately greeted the group.\n\"Welcome home.\"\nCompared to the gorgeous Louis, she seemed to be a rather modest-looking woman. She wore simple clothes with few ornaments, and her dark brown hair was tied up in a single bun.\nUnlike Louis, who was expressing with every fiber of his being that he missed his wife, Rosalie's attitude was nonchalant.\nWhen Louis dropped a kiss on Rosalie's cheek, she didn't move an eyebrow and stared at Monica.\n\"She is?\"\n\"Like me, she is the Seven Sages of the Silent Witch, Miss Monica Everett.\"\nRosalie was a bit taken aback, looking at Monica.\nShe was too young to be the Seven Sages, but more than that, Monica's outfit was probably the reason why she was so surprised.\nWith her small, skinny body, worn-out robe, and shaggy pigtails, she could be mistaken for a vagrant if she were not dressed properly.\nHowever, Rosalie quickly straightened up and bowed to Monica.\n\"My deepest apologies, Lady [Silent Witch]. I'm Rosalie Miller, wife of the [Barrier Magician], Louis Miller. Please allow me to thank you for the care you've given my husband.\"\n\"Pl-Ple-Please… T-To meet… y-you…\"\nMonica also hurriedly bowed her head, but she could barely manage to say this in a strained voice. As a shy person, greeting new people was always something that Monica had a hard time doing with.\nWhen she was bowing in a stiff manner, Louis grabbed Monica by the scruff of her neck and forced her to look up.\n\"Rosalie, I apologize for coming home so early, but… could you please turn back\nthis\ninto a human being?\"\n\"I-I a-am a human.\"\nAt Monica's rebuttal in a mosquito-like voice, Louis snickered as he grabbed Monica by her scruff.\n\"Do you know, my colleague? Right now, you look like a straw doll in rags. If you were to stand in a wheat field, you would surely be mistaken for a scarecrow.\"\n\"S-So mean…\"\nWhen Monica was sniffling, Louis gave her a cold look and said.\n\"If you have a problem with that, why don't you evolve into a human being and come back later? I have no interest in questioning a scarecrow.\"",

      "content": "\"Lady Everett.\"\n\"………………………………..Y-Yesh…\"\nWhen Louis's wife, Rosalie, called out to her, it took Monica about twenty seconds to respond.\nNot accustomed to being called \"Lady Everett,\" had made her response delayed, and by the time she realized her response was late, she couldn't figure out the right timing when she should reply, but since Rosalie was still silently waiting for her, she thought she had to reply, so she gathered up all her courage, but only resulted into that response. It's so embarrassing that she just wants to die.\nHowever, Rosalie did not make fun of Monica's attitude and said calmly.\n\"Excuse me, but may I ask how old you are?\"\n\"Er, um… I-I'm seventeen years old. You are… older than me… so… you don't have… attach \"Lady\" to call me…\"\nIn the meantime, Rosalie stared at mumbling Monica.\nThe way of how she watched Monica was like inspecting something rather than looking down at a shabby girl. After that, she brushed up Monica's bangs, which had been left untended.\n\"I'll gladly take your word… Well then, excuse me, Miss Everett.\"\nRosalie then abruptly pulled Monica's lower eyelids downward.\nMonica blinked in surprise, but a quiet voice of \"don't move,\" urged her to be still.\nFurthermore, Rosalie instructed her to open her mouth to check her oral cavity, and inspected her entire body, down to her hands and nails.\n\"No abnormalities in eye movement, no gingival bleeding. However, your underside lower eyelids are white, and your nails are also white. There are other symptoms that include dry skin, low body weight inappropriate for age… You're showing symptoms of malnutrition and anemia. How many hours did you sleep per day?\"\nAt Rosalie's inquiry, Monica turned over and fidgeted, kneading her fingers.\nAfter living in a cabin and doing a lot of calculations, Monica never had a definite bedtime.\nSince the Seven Sages had a good income and didn't need to conserve candle and lamp oil, they often spent most of their time facing the numbers until their bodies reached their limits and lost consciousness.\n\"Um… my sleeping time… is always random…\"\n\"How many times do you eat in a day? How much food do you eat in general?\"\n\"I eat some nuts when I'm hungry… I sometimes eat some biscuits…\"\nIn any case, she wouldn't go to bed or eat until her body told her she was at her limit.\nShe always ate only the minimum amount of food that could satisfy her hunger, because she felt sleepy when she was full.\nWhen Rosalie found out about Monica's current situation, she proceeded to ask her if she had had any serious illnesses in the past or had any food allergies.\nAfter several repetitions of Monica's slurred answers and Rosalie's repeated questions, Rosalie ended her questioning and called for Lynn.\nA high-ranking spirit in a maid's uniform quickly appeared at Rosalie's call. It was much more swift than when she was in front of her master, Louis.\n\"Did you call me, Lady Rosalie?\"\n\"We have a pot of soup in the oven. Can you please reheat it for me? Also, I need you to soak a piece of bread in some warm milk over low heat.\"\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\nAs Lynn bowed and walked away, Rosalie turned to Monica and rolled up her sleeves.\nRosalie drove Monica's shoulders and led her to the bathroom, while Monica was freaking out about what she was going to do.\n\"In order to turn you into a human being, all you need to do now is to eat and sleep enough. But first, you need to take a bath. Keeping your body clean is fundamental for maintaining a healthy body.\"\nRosalie then ruthlessly stripped Monica, threw her in the bathroom, and scrubbed her all over.\nShe also trimmed her hair, which she had been letting grow long, saying, \"If you let your hair get into your eyes, it can cause eye disease.\" There is no hesitation or reservation in her movement.\nWhen Monica had changed into Rosalie's old clothes, Louis, who had been absent for a long time, showed up.\n\"Now, don't you look a lot more human?\"\nThat's quite a statement.\nAs Monica's mouth agape, Rosalie, who was combing Monica's hair, glared at Louis.\nDespite being a woman, her eyes are sharp and filled with unusual intensity.\n\"I can't believe you have the gall to bring a patient like this before me, Louis Miller. There's no way I'm letting such a little girl in a need leave like that.\"\nWhen Rosalie mentioned the word \"patient,\" Monica insisted in a muffled voice, \"I'm healthy…\"\nHowever, Rosalie asserted sharply.\n\"Anyone who looks at you now will regard you as an unhealthy person.\"\nHusband has their way of talking, it was also for a wife. They were not very much alike, but they do have a similar way of speaking.\nWhen Monica opened and closed her mouth, Louis glanced at her and said.\n\"Rosalie is a doctor. So you'd better listen to what she says, my colleague.\"\nIndeed, the way she looked at Monica was like that of a doctor examining a patient's condition.\nRosalie was a quiet woman, but she had the stubbornness of a doctor who would not let a patient say no to her. And now, Monica has been identified as a patient by her.\n\"The best way to treat her is to improve her diet and sleep schedule.\"\nJust at that moment, Lynn brought in the food for the three of them and laid it on the table.\nIt was a simple meal of bread, salad, roasted duck, and soup, but for Monica's portion, her bread was stewed in milk and the meat was chopped into small pieces.\n\"Don't force yourself to eat everything. It's okay to eat small amounts at a time, just make sure to eat everything in a balanced way.\"\n\"Y-Yes…\"\nBoth the soup and the bread stewed in milk had a light flavor but were delicious. It had been a long time since she had eaten a warm meal.\nMonica tended to forget about eating when she was absorbed in her calculations, and the same could be said for eating. When she is absorbed in eating, she tended to forget about other things. Anyway, she would concentrate on eating until the plate in front of her was empty.\nThat's why I always keep it simple.\nWhen she had emptied her plate in a frenzy, Rosalie said, \"Well done,\" and placed a small plate of dessert in front of Monica. And it was a cherry pie.\nBut there are none for Louis.\n\"Rosalee, where's mine?\"\nGlancing at Monica, who was engrossed in her cherry pie, Louis voiced his discontent\nRosalie chided as she placed a cup of after-dinner tea in front of Louis.\n\"You've been taking in too much sugar. I bet you put a lot of jam and sugar in your tea when you were out. At least, you need to cut down on your sugar at home.\"\nWith that, Rosalie moved the sugar pot away from Louis.\nLouis shook his head sadly and pulled out a small bottle from his pocket. The bottle was labeled as alcohol.\nWhen Louis about to pour the high alcohol into his cup of tea, Rosalie quickly took the bottle from him.\n\"And no more alcohol for you.\"\n\"Jeez, you took my sugar and now my alcohol too, then what will I have left to enjoy in life?\"\n\"I'm your wife and also a doctor. So you'd better listen to what I say, honey.\"\nLouis, who had been told exactly what he had just said to Monica, fell silent and drank his tea without sugar with a sullen face.\nIt was a rare sight to see the haughty Louis being put in his place, but Monica, engrossed in her pie, was oblivious to the scene.\nAs a side note, the thought of Nero starving in her bag never crossed her mind at all.",

      "content": "Louis soaked Monica's light brown hair with a thin layer of fragrant oil and combed it with great care.\n\"Listen, beauty is not something you can achieve in a day. It takes time and effort to achieve. Serendia Academy was built for the children of noble families. So wearing something too shabby will make you look bad.\"\nAfter doing her hair, Louis took out another cream and smeared it on Monica's skin. Monica was now at his mercy, feeling as if she were a doll.\n\"Keep your skin and hair moisturized! That's the most important thing. I will provide you with perfumes and creams separately, so apply them every day before going to bed. Understand?\"\n\"Y-Yes…\"\nMonica replied in a faint voice as her cheek was kneaded.\nHe was very thorough in his commitment to beauty. He was a man with a figure so beautiful that he could be mistaken for a woman. He was supposed to be in his late twenties, but he looked much younger than that.\nSuch beauty of his was evidently the result of his daily care.\n\"Louis… you look more woman than a real woman.\"\nJust as she blurted out what was on her mind, the hand that had been smearing cream on Monica's cheek deepened into her face with a crunch. It hurts.\nLouis had a cold smile on his beautiful feminine face that almost sent chills down her spine.\n\"My colleague, let me tell you something good. I hate it to death when people say that I look like a woman. Do you want to know what happened to the idiot who said it before?\"\nThe hand that grasped Monica's face was filled with strength.\nMonica shuddered in fear as her skull squeezed together.\n\"I'm… I'm sorryyyyyy! I won't say it againnnnn!\"\n\"I'm glad you've been so understanding.\"\nLouis took his hands away from Monica's face and put the bottle of fragrant oil and cream in her hands.\n\"Don't neglect to take care of it properly… you hear me?\"\nWith that, Louis smiled at her.\nHis smile was more beautiful than most women's, but also more intimidating than a dragon's.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThree days had passed since Monica had been staying at Louis Miller's house.\nThe reason she did not immediately sneak into the school was to wait for the arrival of the daughter of Count Kerbeck. Their territory was located near the border and it would take about three days to reach the royal capital.\nWhile awaiting her arrival, Monica was thoroughly drilled in her understanding of Serendia Academy and some manners of the nobility by Louis, while Rosalie instructed her on regular diet and sleep.\nNot that things had changed drastically in just three days, but her complexion, which according to Louis looked like a dead person, seemed to have gotten much better. It took her a while to get used to the idea of sleeping at night, but once the candles and lamps were confiscated, it left her nothing to do, so she slept instead.\nAs for her familiar, Nero, he spent his daytime hours reading a book in the corner of her room. Apparently, he borrowed his favorites author's novels from Lynn.\nNero dexterously flipped through the pages of a romance novel with his cat's paw, and when in the mood, he would stroll aimlessly around the mansion.\nAnd today, too, after having eaten lunch, Nero would go for another walk to relieve his stomach, but when he suddenly returned, he spoke to Monica under the watchful eyes of Louis and the others.\n\"Monica! There's some kind of awesome roll coming!\"\n\"Awesome… roll?\"\n\"It's an orange roll.\"\nWhat was exactly an orange roll?\nTo Monica's puzzlement, Lynn approached Monica quietly.\n\"Miss Monica, the daughter of Count Kerbeck, Lady Isabelle Norton, your collaborator in this infiltration operation of Serendia Academy, has arrived.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"Ohohoho! Good day everyone!\"\nThe one who greeted Monica with a high-pitched laugh that could be heard throughout the mansion was a girl of Monica's age. She was wearing a crimson dress embroidered with luxurious gold threads. Her light orange hair was shaped in magnificent roll, and it appeared that Nero was referring to her ringlet hair.\nAs Monica stood in front of the door, feeling overwhelmed, Young Miss Isabelle Norton put a fan to her mouth and looked at Monica with a mean look in her eyes.\n\"Oh, my, a very good day to you, Aunt Monica. You look as poorly dressed as ever. The fact that you are the youngest member of Kerbeck's family makes me ashamed of myself!\"\nMonica stood there, pale from the clear hostility that was being thrown at her.\nFeeble-minded Monica was sensitive to the malice of others. Even the slightest stinging words can make her shrink. The clear malicious words already brought tears to Monica's eyes.\nBut before Monica could even cower in place, Miss Isabelle smiled at her with a triumphant look.\n\"How does it look now? Did I sound like a villainess? I've been practicing my voice every single day since I was given this role. I'm confident nobody can beat the sharpness of my high-pitched laugh.\"\nWhat does the sharpness of a high-pitched laugh mean, she wondered.\nWhen she saw Monica's eyes darted around in disbelief, Young Miss Isabelle huffed as if she realized something.\n\"Oh my, how embarrassing, I haven't even introduced myself.\"\nThen Young Miss Isabelle pinched the hem of her skirt and made the graceful and beautiful courtesy of a noblewoman.\n\"It is a pleasure to meet you, Lady Monica Everett of the [Silent Witch]. My name is Isabelle Norton, daughter of Azure Norton of Count Kerbeck. Thank you very much for your help in defeating the black dragon. Please allow me to express my gratitude on behalf of my father and my people.\"\nYoung Miss Isabelle smiled at Monica, who was so shocked that she turned into a sculpture.\nIt's a very cute, friendly, and loving smile with no hint of malice.\n\"Oh, I had never imagined that the Seven Sages, who single-handedly shot down a pack of over ten wyverns, and even defeated the legendary Black Dragon of Wogan, were so adorable! I had heard that you are only one year older than I am!\"\nOne year difference means she must be eighteen years old, thought Young Miss Isabelle in the corner of her mind before she took Monica's hand and looked into Monica's face with rosy cheeks.\n\"May I call you Big Sister Monica?\"\nShe was younger than she expected.\n\"Er, um…\"\nLouis, who had been smiling watching this exchange on the couch stood up and forced Monica to lower her head.\n\"Come on, Miss [Silent Witch], Isabelle will be working with you from now on, so why don't you greet her?\"\n\"Ple-Please… take care… ofm—\"\nLouis kept Monica's head down and let out a sigh of exasperation when Monica choked on her words.\n\"I apologize, Lady Isabelle. She is a bit of a shy person.\"\n\"Oh, please, I don't mind. I know Big Sister Monica is a shy person… but she is stronger, more tender-hearted, and braver than anyone else!\"\nWho could that be, Monica wondered. At least she's not a very strong or brave person.\nBut Young Miss Isabelle seemed to be completely trapped in her own world, and with her hands on her rosy cheeks, she looked up into the air enraptured and began to speak.\n\"The Black Dragon of Wogan was said to be difficult to kill even for the dragon knights. Its flames which originated from flames of the underworld can burn through anything and everything, even nullifying the defensive barriers of magicians. It was the strongest, most vicious dragon of all. Exterminating it single-handedly is not something anyone can do! Especially when she left the place without saying a word after slaying the black dragon… it was so dreamy!\"\nIn fact, the only reason why Monica joined in the fight against the black dragon was, she was told by Louis, \"Why don't you exercise once in a while?\" before dragged out by grabbing her neck.\nIt was not out of modesty that she did not participate in the party, but out of shyness.\nHowever, to Young Miss Isabelle, who was unaware of such circumstances, Monica appeared to be a brave and humble great magician.\nThis was a huge misunderstanding, but Monica wasn't eloquent enough to explain it, and for Louis, he was trying to make use of the misunderstanding to the best of his advantage.\n\"Big Sis Monica! I've heard you've been assigned as a secret bodyguard to protect His Highness Felix this time! I'm honored to be able to help you with that! In order to prevent you from being suspected, I will put my utmost effort to bully you! So please rest assured and give your whole attention to protecting His Highness!\"\nAfter saying that, Young Miss Isabel took Monica's hand and shook it upside down.\nCompletely swept up in the atmosphere, Monica was left to her own devices and could only say in a faint voice, \"Yes….\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nWhile Young Miss Isabelle clung to Monica in excitement, Louis smiled kindly and distanced himself slightly from them.\nThere, a beautiful woman in a maid's uniform, Lynn, approached and asked him a question.\n\"Two members of the Magical Corps who had infiltrated Serendia Academy have been discovered by His Highness and kicked out of the academy.\"\nWhat an astute prince, Louis thought, clicking his tongue soundlessly.\nHe had sent out some members of the Magical Corps in case they were needed, but he hadn't expected them to see through him so quickly.\nWith Monica and Young Miss Isabelle about to enter the school, it was inevitable that the second prince would be suspicious of them.\nAlthough there was no direct connection between Count Kerbeck and Louis, it should raise no small amount of suspicion in the second prince. These two people could be Louis Miller's minions, or so he thought.\n\"We need someone to act as a diversion.\"\n\"And, who could it be?\"\n\"I will enroll my foolish disciple at the same time as Miss Monika and Lady Isabelle are enrolled here.\"\nA grin crept onto Louis's face, and his eyes glinted sharply behind one pair of glasses.\n\"That way, His Highness' suspicions will undoubtedly be directed on him, won't they?\"\nSpeaking of his disciples, he had once destroyed half of the school building of Minerva, an institution for training magicians.\nSo, Monica Everett, the [Silent Witch], a girl who has a problem with interpersonal skills. Lady Isabelle, who has been playing the role of a villainess for her. And a disciple of Louis Miller, who once had a record of destroying a school building.\nWith these three misfits being admitted at the same time, Lynn secretly wondered, how quickly Serendia Academy would collapse.\n\"Two months, I'd guess.\"\n\"What are you saying out of the blue, you stupid maid.\"\nIt was (her prediction of) the time left before the prestigious Serendia Academy collapsed.",

      "content": "It's a new arc!\nSerendia Academy was named after one of the spirit kings, Serendine, Goddess of Light, in the hope to gain her blessing. And the motif of the school emblem was the tin staff and lily crown that Goddess of Light holds in her hands.\nOriginally, neither royalty nor nobility was used to attending school, but as time went by, several educational institutions had been established for the children of noble families began to increase. And this Serendia Academy was one of them.\nAt present, there were several schools, boarding houses, and girls' academies for the children of the wealthy and big shots, but among them, Serendia Academy was one of the most prestigious, with a history of being the first royal school in the Ridill Kingdom.\nThe three most prestigious schools in the Ridill Kingdom were the [Serendia Academy], which was attended by members of the royal family, [Minerva], which was an institution for the training of magicians, and the [House of Parliament], which was affiliated with the temple.\nOf these schools, [House of Parliament] was the one with the greatest legal expertise. [Minerva] was the best in the field of magic and spells. And {Serendia Academy] was the most outstanding in the field of liberal arts.\nThey have top-notch instructors, an overwhelming collection of books, and facilities and equipment suitable for the children of noble families.\nDespite the high enrollment fees and donations regulations, those who graduate from Serendia Academy often have an advantage when working for the royal court later on. For the noble families, the title of \"Serendia Academy graduate\" was a kind of status.\nEspecially those with experience in the student council of Serendia Academy, it goes without saying that they are highly regarded by those around them.\nNot to mention, now that the second prince, Felix Ark Ridill, was the current student council president. So, being a member of this group meant could be said to be a candidate for the second prince's future entourage.\nCurrently, in the student council room where all the student council members gather, a student was being interrogated.\nStanding in the middle of the room was Aaron O'Brien, the son of Count Stiyl, the treasurer of the student council.\nAnd now, he was surrounded by the student council members, all of whom stared at him coldly, as if they were looking at a sinner.\nIn the tense atmosphere student council room, the only person who has a smile on his face was a young man sitting at the student council president's desk with his cheekbones in his hand—the student council president and the second prince of the Ridill Kingdom, Felix Ark Ridill.\n\"Now then.\"\nAt Felix's words, Aaron's shoulders jerked as if he had been whipped.\nTo Aaron, Felix smiles like a benevolent saint.\n\"The results of the audit showed signs of falsification in the books. There had been a mismatch in the budget. And that wasn't just once or twice… Am I right?\"\nHis voice was gentle and calm, yet there was a coldness in it that sent shivers down the spine of the listener.\nWhen Aaron interjected, \"That's…,\" Felix put his hand over his mouth and chuckled.\n\"Oh, so you don't remember how many times you've spent it? From what I can tell, that's thirty-eight times.\"\nOnly the voice that said \"thirty-eight\" was low and heavy.\nAaron's complexion was no longer pale, but ashen.\nBut Felix, with a kind smile on his face, blocked Aaron's escape route and confronted him with the severity of his crime.\n\"The only reason you could become a member of the student council was because of my grandfather, Duke Crockford's recommendation.\"\nAll members of the student council were appointed by the student council president.\nTherefore, there were a number of people who were willing to pay money to gain favor with Felix——or more specifically, with his grandfather, Duke Crockford, who was behind it. And among them, the one who spent the most money was Aaron's father, Count Stiyl.\nThat's why Duke Crockford has ordered his grandson, Felix, to select Aaron as a member of the student council.\nAs long as Aaron continued to work as treasurer, the future of both of him and Count Stiyl's family would be secure.\nHowever, Count Stiyl's family was in trouble because they had spent too much on Duke Crockford. As a result, Aaron's allowance was reduced, and when he was in the need of money to play, he spent the student council's budget.\nOnce that truth was discovered, Aaron's expulsion from school was unavoidable.\nFelix's eyes narrowed and leaned his head coyly. His soft blond hair swayed slightly.\n\"The best punishment that I could give you was an expulsion. But… if my grandfather heard of this, I'm sure he will give up on Count Stiyl.\"\nAnyone who attends this school would know it.\nBehind the second prince was the most powerful aristocrat in the country, the Duke of Crockford.\nAnd that Duke Crockford was a ruthless person.\n\"I heard your father was in need of Duke Crockford's trust in order to get a loan. What a pity. After this, Count Stiyl sure would not be able to get a loan from anywhere, and it would even cause the House of Stiyl to decline.\"\nAaron's face broke out in a sweat.\nAs Aaron shuddered, Felix finished him off with a saintly smile.\n\"Now do you understand? Because of your stupidity, the House of Stiyl is doomed to fall.\"\nAaron's eyes widened to their limit, and he bared his teeth and made a strange noise. Then he screamed in a voice that sounded like he was going to vomit blood.\n\"Shut up, shut up, shut up! You are not even a royal family… you [Duke's dog]!\"\nAaron jumped onto his desk and tried to grab onto Felix.\nHowever, a platinum blond young man, one of his aides, who was standing by the wall, quickly seized him.\nAnd then, he chanted a quick incantation, causing Aaron's legs to be covered with a block of ice. Now he could no longer move a single step in his place.\nCyril Ashley, the platinum blonde young man who had restrained Aaron with ice spell——the vice president of the student council, glared at Aaron, distorting his neat face into anger.\n\"You dare! You dare to utter such insolent against His Highness?! You're deserved to die! I'll turn you into an ice statue right here and smash you out the window!\"\n\"Vice President Ashley, getting rid of him is not your job.\"\nWhen Felix stopped him in a calm voice, Cyril turned to Felix and bowed deeply.\n\"I deeply apologize for overstepping my bounds.\"\n\"I know you were just worried about my safety. I am very grateful for your effort in keeping me safe.\"\nHearing Felix said that in a smile, Cyril was overjoyed and his eyes welled up.\nWhen he wasn't talking, Vice President Cyril Ashley was a beautiful young man who was known as the \"Ice Prince,\" but he tended to get overly passionate when Felix was involved.\nNot to mention, now Aaron had betrayed the student council and tried to attack Felix with verbal abuse. Even executing him a hundred times would not be enough, the look on his face was telling that.\nFelix calmly soothed Cyril and then turned his attention to Aaron, whose legs were iced over.\n\"You will be placed under house arrest in the dormitory until you are officially notified of your expulsion. I hope you can fully appreciate your own stupidity in allowing yourself to be outdone by this [Duke's dog].\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAfter the son of Count Stiyl, Aaron O'Brien left the room flanked by guards, Felix let out a sigh and picked up the documents he had left spread out on his desk.\n\"Now, that should wrap this up… is what I'd like to say, but we'll have to find a replacement treasurer for him soon.\"\n\"If that's the case, I, Cyril Ashley, will take the responsibility of compiling a list of people I can trust to never betray His Highness!\"\nThe faithful Cyril had the attitude that he would start making the list at any moment.\nHowever, Felix said \"It's not necessary,\" and dismissed it with a soft smile.\n\"Someone who would never betray me? There is no such person in this world. People always have the possibility of betrayal when circumstances change.\"\nFelix looked at Cyril, who was trying to tell him that he would never betray him, and said,\n\"It also applies to me, you know.\"\nA different kind of tense atmosphere took over the room after the kind when Aaron was being punished.\nThe one who controls the atmosphere in this room will always be the one who sits in the chair of the student body president. So,\n\"Speaking of which.\"\nFelix smiled jokingly and instantly changed the atmosphere of the place.\nHe then lifted the document in his hand for everyone to see.\n\"We need to elect new members to the board, but we also need to prepare for the welcome party for the new students. Besides, I heard we have two new students transferring into the second year class this year.\"\nTwo names are listed in the transfer student section.\nGlenn Dudley.\nMonica Norton.\n\"This Glenn Dudley, I heard he's a pupil of that Seven Sages… Louis Miller of the [Barrier Magician].\"\nThese words sent the student council officers into a frenzy.\nThe first person to speak up was the vice president, Cyril.\n\"Speaking of Louis Miller, isn't he famous for being a member of the First Prince faction? Could it be that disciple Glenn Dudley is an assassin he sent to kill His Highness?!\"\n\"I've heard some rumors about him…\"\nFollowing Cyril was Bridget, the student council secretary, who was the only female student in the room.\nWith her bright golden ringlet hair and impeccable good looks, she was an intimidatingly powerful beauty. A beautiful woman with a powerful presence that intimidates those who see her, she covered her mouth with a fan and closed her thick, amber eyes.\n\"I heard that Louis Miller's disciples were the troublemakers who destroyed the Minerva school building.\"\n\"How could our school accept such a person!\"\nWhen Cyril ranted in a hysterical voice, the other secretary, Elliot Howard, who had been silent until now, raised one hand and spoke up.\n\"That's because this is an academy for study. Everybody can get in as long as they pay properly and pass the exam.\"\nAt Elliot's carefree remark, Cyril clumsily scratched his hair which made his good looks ruined.\n\"The school should've selected their students carefully, including their families and factions! We must firmly protest this against the school principal!\"\n\"I think that would be overkill. I mean, it's not like anything's happened yet.\"\n\"But if something happens to His Highness, it will be too late!\"\nCyril snapped at Elliot's words, but Elliot didn't seem particularly upset and said, \"Don't be so uptight.\" Elliot's this kind of attitude must have been unpleasant to Cyril.\nSensing that Cyril was about to start yelling, the last student council member, a small and plain boy named Neil, looked at Felix worriedly.\n\"Um… What should we do, President?\"\nFelix looked at Cyril, Elliot, Neil, and Bridget in turn, observing the slight changes in their expressions.\nThen, with a gentle smile, without revealing that he had been secretly observing them, he said.\n\"Elliott is right. Everybody has the same right to learn. And… I trust you'll be able to protect me, right, Cyril Ashley?\"\nWhen Felix called his name, Cyril expressed his delight with his whole body and put his hand on his chest.\n\"Yes, I will protect Your Highness even at the cost of my life!\"\n\"Thank you. That's reassuring.\"\nWith that, Felix smiled at Cyril and proceeded with the next item on the agenda.\nThus, the student council members focused only on Louis Miller's pupils, and none of them paid any attention to the girl, Monica Norton, before moving on to the next topic.\nIt was just as Louis Miller had planned.",

      "content": "Serendia Academy, it was a school which enrolled by children of noble families, that's why either its building or its dormitory was looked so magnificent.\nFrom the point of view of a commoner like Monica, who had enrolled at Minerva where the best institute for magicians, looking at its building had enough to make her feel it so grandiose, but now she looked at Serendia Academy, it was felt even more than that. It was even much more gorgeous and grandiose than the mansions of lower-class nobles.\nFor students who have donated more than a certain amount of money, have excellent grades, or have been active in some activities such as being a member of the student council will be assigned in a private room. As for the rest, they would basically be assigned to a room for two people with another person.\nOf course, Monica will also receive this treatment, which was to share a room with another person, but after knowing this, Monica was, \"That's impossible for me! I would die if you do that…\" bawling nagged to Louis.\nConsidering her current mission, it would best if she was placed in the same room with her collaborator, Young Miss Isabelle. But, because Isabelle was a sixteen years old freshman, and Monica was a seventeen years old sophomore, they would be assigned to a different room for each of their respected grades.\nThe fact Isabelle was a freshman and Monica was a transfer student who had accompanied her has made it difficult for them to be assigned to the same room.\nTherefore, Isabelle would make her move to greet the headmaster, that is.\nUnlike the freshmen, a transfer student like Monica has to meet the headmaster before starting her class. So, to attend that meeting, she had forced her way in.\nAfter sitting alone on the couch across from the headmaster, she smiled proudly, leaving Monica stood behind her.\n\"Ohohohoho! Headmaster, I don't have to mention my private room as a matter of course, don't I? I hope you wouldn't be so tactful for asking me to share a room with this woman.\"\nWhen she said, \"this woman,\" Isabelle indicated Monica with her chin, who was standing behind her.\nIn her hometown, Count Kerbeck Family can be considered as one of the five wealthiest among the local noble families. Naturally, they've donated a reasonable amount of money, so the headmaster was, \"Naturally,\" while rubbing his hand while smiling fondly at her.\n\"We have prepared a room suitable for a daughter of Count Kerbeck like you.\"\n\"My, thank you for your consideration. But, I feel sorry for her roommate to share a room with this muddlehead! She truly is a disgrace to our Kerbeck Family!\"\nIsabelle turned her head and raised her tone in a slightly exaggerated manner, before glancing up at Monica, who was standing behind with her head down, then said this with a nasty smile.\n\"I think an attic would suit you perfectly… Don't you agree?\"\nMonica could only nod with trepidation, while Isabelle said, \"even the person herself agreed with me,\" to press the matter to the headmaster.\nHer tactfulness had led to Monica being assigned to a small attic room on the top floor of the dormitory above the storage room.\nFor ordinary well-bred young ladies, that treatment would make them break down in tears, but for Monica, nothing would be more gratifying than that.\nAs such, a small place with a dimly lit would make her feel at home, and since her room was located on a different floor from the other girls, she wouldn't have to bump into them in the hallway.\nAfter leaving the headmaster's office, Isabelle's sharp eyes suddenly moistened.\nLooking at Monica who was flustered, Isabelle took out a handkerchief and wiped her eyes.\n\"To tell you the truth, I wish I could be assigned to the same room as you, Big Sister Monica…But I do not want to interfere with your mission. And this is something I am well aware of!\"\n\"Er… Um… Thank you… very much…\"\nWhen Monica thanked her in a choppy voice, Isabelle was clinging to Monica's neck.\n\"Oh, Big Sister Monica! Can I come to your room once in a while? Wait! Or rather, please come and visit me in my room! I'll do my best to show you my best hospitality!\"\n\"O-Okay…\"\nJust then, she saw figures that looked like students in the corridor. She couldn't distinguish their face because of the distance, but she assumed it was probably male students.\nWith that though, Isabelle immediately straightened her posture, looked down at Monica as if she were looking at garbage, then spoke in a high tone.\n\"Hey, what are you waiting for?! Oh, goodness gracious! You're truly a disgrace to the Kerbeck family! Be careful on your words, never mention the name of Count Kerbeck in the school!\"\nWith that, Isabelle brushed back her orange ringlets and tucked her chin.\nTo perfect this pose alone, she had practiced this many times in front of the mirror. The key point was the angle at which she lifted her chin.\n\"I will be attending the entrance ceremony. You are a transfer student, so you should be going to your class, I presume? And make sure to never mention the name of the Count of Kerbeck! After all, I have never acknowledged you as a member of Count Kerbeck's family!\"\nDespite telling her not to mention the name of Count Kerbeck, she repeatedly called out that name in a loud enough volume for everyone around her to hear, to give the impression that Monica was a person of low status in the Kerbeck family.\nAnyone who saw such a scene where Young Miss Isabelle glared and said \"Where's your greeting?\" at Monica who's nodding her head with trepidation would understand the meaning of their relationship.\nA girl named Monica has complicated circumstances in the Count's family, and Isabelle, the daughter of the Count, disliked her very much.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"Did you see that, Your Highness?\"\nAt some distance away, two people were watching the exchange between Young Miss Isabelle and Monica.\nOne of them was a young man with loosely wavy brown hair. Student Council Secretary, Elliot Howard.\nAnd the other one was a young man with honey blond hair and blue eyes. Student Council President, Felix Ark Ridill.\nFrom what Elliot told him, the girl with orange ringlets who were making a ruckus in the hallway was a freshman.\n\"So she was a freshman. And the girl beside her… has a different grade, I wonder.\"\nThe girls' uniforms consist of a neat one-piece dress that covers the wrists and ankles, but the color of the sleeve ornaments differs depending on the grade. So even from some distance away, one can tell what grade they are in by looking at the color on their sleeves.\nEliot looked as if he remembered something and clapped his hands.\n\"Ah, could it be she was that transfer student? I think she was the other student that transferred at the same time as the disciple of Louis Miller. Um, I think her name is…\"\n\"Monica Norton.\"\nFelix who had answered immediately receive admiration from Elliot who widened his droopy eyes.\n\"You've good memory as always, Your Highness.\"\n\"I've seen the orange-haired lady a few times at parties in the capital, she should be Young Miss Isabelle Norton from Count Kerbeck's family.\"\nIsabelle Norton and Monica Norton. In normal circumstances, they would be considered sisters, but their appearances were too different.\nElliot snorted, \"Hmm,\" and put a finger to his chin.\n\"I suspect the new student was also a member of the Count's family. But from the way she treated her, she might be a daughter born from his mistress.\"\n\"Things like this bound to happen In our society.\"\n\"I guess you're right. Though, it's not very pleasant to look at.\"\nElliot frowned uncomfortably as he said this.\nFelix's gentle smile remained intact, but he looked at Elliot with somewhat cold eyes.\n\"It's not very pleasant? Are you referring to Young Miss Isabelle, who treating harshly to Young Miss Monica?\"\n\"No. I felt very unpleasant at the fact that a person who is not even considered as a noble family is enrolled in this Serendia Academy.\"\nAs the legitimate son of a count, Elliot Howard seemed to be a cheerful and magnanimous young man. But no matter how tolerant and good-natured he may seem, he was still a proud aristocrat.\nElliot's eyes were very cold as he looked at the back of Monica's figure walking timidly behind Isabelle.\n\"Don't you think so too, Your Highness?\"\n\"I wonder.\"\nFelix was looking at the back of Monica's figure, looking a little thoughtful about something.\nThe only thing he could tell from this distance was, she's a small girl with light brown hair. Of course, he couldn't see her face.\nHowever, something was strangely stuck in his mind.\n\"I have confidence in remembering people I've greeted once, but why couldn't I remember her?\"\n\"How could such a person have ever met you, Your Highness. I mean, she's just a girl from the countryside.\"\nElliot denied it outright, but Felix silently stared at the back of Monica's figure.\nHe's staring at how she curled up her back as she walking timidly.\n……\n….\n..\nBut, he did not realize such a back belonged to the Silent Witch, who wore the robes of the Seven Sages at the ceremony with her hood pulled down tightly to cover her face.",

      "content": "At Minerva, where Monica used to attend, were mostly have uniforms with dark green or navy colors, but the ones at Serendia Academy were the complete opposite. The overall color scheme was bright and white, with gorgeous gold and silver ornaments.\nThe uniform for female students consists of an elegant ankle-length dress. It should be noted that both boys and girls were required by the dress code to wear gloves.\nEven though there was no dress code in Minerva for wearing gloves, but the children of noble families would always wear them.\nSerendia Academy was a school reserved for the nobility. As such, the students were expected to dress and behave in a manner befitting in their social circle.\nBut, of course, Monica was having none of it. To be honest, it was almost a miracle that she was able to stand and walk without fainting.\nHer hands, inside the unfamiliar white gloves, were already soaked with cold sweat.\n\"She is the new transfer student that would come into our class, Monica Norton.\"\nStanding in front of the podium and being introduced to her classmates made Monica feel like a criminal on the stand.\nAll the eyes of her classmates have focused on Monica alone. If she had been a freshman, she wouldn't have been the only one getting attention.\n\"Okay, please introduce yourself.\"\nMonica's throat began to spasm as the teacher urged her on. Being exposed in front of people was already unbearable, but now, she had to introduce herself!\nI need to say something…\nLouis has told her that in these situations, all she has to do was say her name followed by, \" Please take care of me,\" then finished with a bow.\nBut for Monica, just doing that alone was already too much of an ordeal.\nAs Monica kept her head down in silence, her classmates' gazes subtly changed. They were irritated by her lack of greetings in her introduction, and they were contemptuous of her apparent nervousness. That's what scared Monica the most.\nWhen Monica tried to open her mouth to say something, she ended up just gaping her mouth, but couldn't say anything and fell silent.\n\"…that's enough. Have a seat. Your seat is at the end near the corridor.\"\nThe old male teacher let out a long breath of exasperation and mentioned Monica sit in her seat.\nUnable to reply, Monica made her way to her seat on shaky legs. Her classmates looked at her coldly, watching her unsteady steps.\nEventually, the class started, but the teacher's lecture did not register in Monica's mind at all.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"Hey.\"\nEven during the break, Monica was sitting still in her chair until she heard a voice right next to her.\nCould it be that she was talking to me? But what if she was talking to someone else?\nAfraid to look up at her face, it had ended with her shoulder tapped instead.\n\"Hey, I'm talking to you. Transfer student.\"\nShe jolted her shoulders and lifted her head nervously.\nStaring down at Monica was a girl with flaxen hair. She was pale, had large eyes, and appeared to be a little competitive. Her hair was braided in an elaborate manner, and gold earrings were swinging in her ears.\n\"My name is Lana Colette.\"\nThe girl, who introduced herself as Lana, stared at Monica from the top of her head to the tips of her shoes before putting her hands on her hips.\n\"Hey, why are you hanging your hair up in pigtails? Nobody in this school does their hair like a rural girl.\"\nAs Lana had said, Monica's light brown hair was parted in two and hung in a loose braid.\nLouis had taught her a few hairstyles that were appropriate for a lady of nobility, but she was having a hard time remembering how to do it.\nLadies who have maids in their dormitories would have their maids set them up, but of course, Monica has no such maid.\n\"I don't know… any other style… besides this…\"\nWith that one word, the eyes of the classmates around her turned to look at Monica as if to say, \"I knew it.\"\nBy saying what she just said, Monica exposed the fact that she didn't have a maid. Anyone who did not bring a maidservant to the dormitory was either very poor or had the lowest status without a title.\n\"Where's your hometown?\"\nAt Lana's question, Monica choked on her words. Monica was born and raised in a town relatively close to the royal capital, but now she had to pretend to be related to the House of Count Kerbeck.\n\"I am from Rennac.\"\nWhen she mentioned one of the cities in the Count's domain, Lana was, \"Oh, my!\" and widened her eyes.\n\"Oh, so you're from a big city on the border! I'm sure they get a lot of rare clothes from neighboring countries there. Hey, what kind of designs are popular in Rennac now? How about dresses? What scarves do they have?\"\nLana's constant questions were finally getting too much for Monica.\nMonica wasn't from Rennac in the first place, and even had she lived there, she wouldn't have known anything about the latest trends.\n\"I am sorry… I don't really understand… that kind of thing…\"\nWhen Monica apologized with a mumble, Lana's lips pouted in annoyance.\n\"Hey, why aren't you wearing any makeup? Don't you know at least how to wear white powder, lipstick, and eyebrow ink? Look at the color of this lipstick. It's the latest thing from the cosmetics store in the capital.\"\nNext, Lana gave Monica a series of criticisms about her clothes.\nFor example, she was told how cute were gloves with embroidery on them, how absurd was it that she didn't wear a single accessory, and how outdated were her shoe designs.\nAnd Monica could only manage to utter, \"I'm not sure,\" and \"I'm sorry,\" in a shaky voice.\nBecause she truly didn't understand anything she was saying.\nLana's hair was elaborately styled with beautiful hair ornaments attached to it. Her gloves were adorned with frills, and the ribbon ornament on her collar was gorgeously embroidered. Even though she wore the same uniform as Monica, they gave different impressions.\nLooking at how troubled Monica was, the girls around her covered their mouths with their fans and started whispering to each other.\n\"Hey, look at how that rich baron's daughter is bragging about her riches to those country bumpkins.\"\n\"I mean, no one else would listen to her, so she's tangling with those bumpkins.\"\n\"After all, she bought her title with money. Talking about desperate.\"\nNo matter how much they whispered, it was loud enough for Monica to hear. Of course, Lana was able to hear it as well.\nLana's thin eyebrows trembled, but she eventually brushed back her flaxen hair and snorted\n\"Forget it. Talking to these lame country bumpkins is boring.\"\n\"… I am sorry.\"\nThe word \"boring\" was something Monica was used to being told.\nMonica was aware of how boring she wass, to the point of being fed up with it.\nShe can't keep up with the same topics as everyone else and had no idea what all the latest trends are. The only things she has an interest in were numbers and magic.\nRather than saying something that would make them feel uncomfortable, she would rather be treated as if she were not there.\nSo all Monica could do was keep her head down and stay put, avoiding eye contact with anyone.\nLike what she was doing now, she was frozen in place like a stone, until Lana suddenly reached out and grabbed Monica's braid.\nAfter found that Monica was gasping in horror, Lana sharply told her, \"stay still.\"\nShe then dexterously arranged Monica's pigtails in some way and pinned them in place. Since there was no mirror here, she had no idea what her head looked like.\nBut Lana said, \"That's better,\" and gave a nod of approval.\n\"Look, this much is easy! You should be able to do this!\"\nAfter saying that, Lana walked back to her seat with a big stride.\nMonica hesitantly touched her head with her fingertips.\nThe part she touched was a pinned ribbon swaying with a soft touch.\nTLN: Found this on the internet.",

      "content": "Most Serendia students would have their lunch at the school cafeteria.\nThe school's cafeteria was staffed with top-notch chefs and waiters. In fact, every single dish has been tested for poisoning, so they can eat with ease.\nHowever, a number of wealthy students would bring their own cooks and waiters into the dormitory. After having them cook in the dorm's cafeteria, they would eat their meal in their own rooms. Even the second prince, who was the subject of Monica's protection, also had such behavior.\nT-Then, I don't really need to go to the cafeteria…\nAfter making excuses for herself, Monica sneaked out of the classroom just at the lunch break start.\nAll the students in Monica's class were moving towards the cafeteria, but Monica went against the flow and went out of the school building.\nShe had put a handful of nuts in her pockets, so she could eat it in a less crowded place.\nFor Monica, finding quiet places has always been her specialty. At the time she was still a Minerva student, she always spent a lot of time holed up in her secret hiding place, reading and doing calculations.\nSince today's weather was clear and not too windy, Monica then decided to take a walk outside.\nSerendia Academy occupied a very large area, and its gardens were beautifully arranged. Now the summer flowers were over, the buds of the autumn roses were beginning to swell.\nIn general, the season of admission for schools attended by nobles usually set in autumn, while for commoners was set in spring.\nThe reason for this was because nobles were busy during the social activities from spring to summer, while commoners were especially busy during the harvest festival in autumn. Therefore, they tended to avoid those periods to make it for admission.\nAlthough Monica came from common families, she had never been enrolled in commoners school. Since her father was very knowledgeable, she was taught everything by him. But after his death, she went through many twists and turns before being adopted by someone who was her father's apprentice and enrolled at Minerva, an institution for training magicians.\nIt was also one of the reasons Monica was not used to living in a group. Even after becoming its student, she didn't have any people that could be considered as friends.\nDespite that, because of her talent for magic, she was given a place at Minerva. Only to make her shut herself in the laboratory.\nBut, despite having studied in that school, she was still unable to display her talent here. Although Serendia Academy itself has a system to let its students choose their curriculum… but, that would be a problem if she had to perform her magic in public.\nMonica, who has a social anxiety disorder, can only use magic with no chanting.\nAlso, if she performed her no-chant magic there, her identity as [Silent Witch] would be exposed.\nMonica let out a sigh and touched the ribbon pinned in her hair.\nI haven't… even been able to thank her.\nThe words she wanted to say were always stuck in Monica's throat then swallowed without being spoken.\nLet alone talking to my classmate properly… now I had to get close to the second prince, what am I supposed to do?\nTo protect the second prince, she must get close to him. But he was in the third year while Monica was in the second year. There's already a difference in grade, to begin with.\nIf Louis really wanted me to be the second prince's secret guard, he should have at least transferred me in the same grade as him. Well, if he really needs a reliable guard, he should have sent a man. I mean, boys' and girls' dorms were located separately.\nAlthough Louis Miller acted so outrageous and has an awfully bad personality, he himself was very competent.\nHe also knew that he couldn't fail this mission.\nAnd yet, there were too many holes in the whole plan of \"to protect the prince\". In the beginning, sending Monica to that school was already reckless.\nMaybe Louis has other plans in mind…\nThinking about this, Monica crossed the garden until reached the back of the school building. There, she found a large fence. That place was supposed to be part of the school grounds as well, but because the gate was closed, she can't go any further from this.\nThere was a sign on the gate that said, \"Old garden, currently under maintenance.\"\nIf it was this place…\nAfter looking down for the entire morning, Monica lifted her head to look up at the iron fence.\nIt was pretty tall in its own right, but it was still no more than twice Monica's height.\nI think this height was still okay…\nMonica made sure that no one was around before she invoked her magic with no chanting.\nA small whirlwind swirled around her feet. After manipulating the wind with her magic, she lightly kicked the ground. With just that, her body lightly flying over the iron fence.\nThis was an application of flight magic which was often used by the Magic Corps. Originally, flight magic was used to fly at high speed, but Monica, who was fatally lacking in a sense of balance and motor skills, was unable to use flight magic. However, she could manage to use it to jump over a height like this.\nEven at this height, doing this was still scary.\nHolding her throbbing heart, Monica walked quickly through the old garden. This kind of enclosed space was the perfect place to hide.\nAlthough there was a sign saying that the area was under maintenance, the trees were not as desolate as expected. However, there were hardly any flowers around. Apparently, all the flowers had been moved to the flower beds outside. What was blooming here were only autumn wildflowers.\nBut it is nice and quiet.\nThinking that she would be able to relax here, she felt a little better. Then she began looking for a good stone to sit on.\nHowever, her buoyant steps came to a halt when she turned her gaze at one of the azalea bushes.\nBehind it was someone sitting at the edge of the now unused fountain reading some papers. The distance between them made it difficult to see his face, but his beautiful honey-colored hair could be seen.\nThe man noticed Monica and turned his head.\n\"Who is there?\"\n\"Hiiek!\"\nMonica quickly turned around and tried to flee from that place, but her feet stumbled over a stone.\n\"Hyah!\"\nFalling down with a loud squeal, nuts slipped out of Monica's pocket before scattered all over the place.\n\"I…\"\nAs Monica fumbled trying to get up, she heard a chuckled voice over.\n\"This place is supposed to be locked… Looks like there's some little squirrel lost her way.\"\nMonica began to think in a half panic.\nHow come there is a person in a place that is off-limits?\n(she forgot about herself)\nThe fact he could enter and exit a place he isn't supposed to be was just too suspicious.\n(she forgot about herself)\nCould it be this man was a suspicious person?\n(she didn't include herself)—In her confusion, Monica's thought process eventually led her to such conclusions.\nDon't tell me this man… is an assassin… who wants to kill His Highness!\nOnce she started thinking that way, the stack of papers in the man's hand began to look like an assassination order.\nYes, this guy must have been planning his method in this place to assassinate the second prince, or so she thought.\nMoreover, assuming this man was an assassin, he would not have overlooked Monica as a witness.\nShe heard footsteps approaching came closer.\n\"Hieek!\"\nMonica, half-crying, created wind with her no-chant magic. Although it was non-lethal magic, the gust of wind which she had created caused the man's body to stagger. The bundle of papers he was holding danced in the wind and scattered harshly like flurry snow.\nHe held his hair lightly before bent down to pick up something.\nThe thing the man picked up was not the scattered papers but the nuts that had spilled out of Monica's pocket.\n\"I think the wind has spilled a few of your snacks.\"\nThe man then gently lifted Monica's trembling hand and placed the nuts he had picked in it.\n\"What can I do for you is to gather back these nuts. Would you forgive me with that, Little squirrel?\"\n\"……..\"\nThe man went on picking up Monica's nuts before he did with his own documents.\nIf the man was an assassin, he would not have been this kind.\nSuddenly, Monica noticed. All of the documents scattered around her feet were filled with numbers. And it was not assassination orders but ledgers.\n\"I'm… I'm sorry… I'm sorry… I'm sorry…\"\nMonica hurriedly crawled on the ground and gathered up the scattered documents. Fortunately, the ledgers were marked with the dates of the expenditures, so she could figure out the general order by looking at the contents.\nWhile Monica was shuffling through her papers, the man was leisurely gathering her nuts. Apparently, he didn't care much for the documents.\nMonica brushed the dirt from the documents then rearranged them in order of date. In the process, her eyes were drawn to the numbers, which was something of a habit. Whenever Monica saw a number line, she couldn't help but follow it with her eyes.\nAh…\nAfter a quick look over the documents, Monica felt her heart was itching.\nFor Monica, who has always valued numbers more than anything, finding calculations that didn't add up to an answer was uncomfortable. It's akin to a single stain on a perfect painting.\nAnd now the documents Monica had picked up were full of \"stains\".\n\"Thanks for picking that up.\"\nWith that, the man placed the rest of the nuts in Monica's hand.\nOnly now did Monica realize it. This man——this young man, just like Monica, was wearing the school uniform. He was a student here.\nMonica kept her head down, presented the papers she had picked up to the young man, and said in a shaky voice.\n\"Thirty…\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"There were thirty-nine flaws in this calculation.\"\nAfter saying that, Monica pushed the documents to the young man and turned on her heel to flee from that place.\nThe young man who had been left behind watched Monica's back in silence for a while, but when she disappeared from sight, he flipped through the documents at hand.\n\"…thirty-nine flaws?\"\nThe young man muttered and narrowed his blue eyes slightly.",

      "content": "\"Yo, Monica. Good work. Have you managed to get in touch with the prince?\"\nThe sun was already dark when Monica returned to her attic in the dormitory, and Nero, the black cat, came jumping in through the attic window.\nMonica, who had been lying her face down on the bed as soon as she returned to the attic, got up lazily and shook her head helplessly.\nAt the moment, Monica was unable to interact with her classmates on a human level, let alone make contact with the prince. Given this situation, she wondered how she could get close to the prince.\nWhile Monica whimpered in tears, Nero wagged his tail from side to side and said with pride.\n\"I've gathered some information! Now, praise me!\"\n\"…Yeah. Thanks, Nero.\"\n\"Listen up and be surprised, the second prince is the student council president. This means, if you become a student council member, you can naturally get in touch with him.\"\nIndeed, Nero's point was spot on.\nThe second prince and Monica were in different grades, so it was very difficult to approach him normally. However, if they become members of the same student council, she can approach him naturally. But…\n\"That's impossibleeee.\"\nIn order to become a student council member, one must have excellent grades. On top of that, one must also have connections with the students' council members.\n\"But, you know, Monica. You are that of Seven Sages. And a genius at that. So if you score really well on the next test, you could become a member of the student council, I think.\"\nMonica silently shook her head and laid her textbook on the desk.\nThe textbooks were overwhelmingly about the history and foreign languages. When it comes to the knowledge required by a child of a noble family, this was only natural.\nMonica's background was in all things related to magic. She knew a lot about the history of magic, fundamental magic, magic formulas, and the laws related to magic, but other than that her overall grade was below average except for arithmetic.\n\"Hey, you went to a school called Minerva, right? Didn't you study any languages there?\"\n\"At Minerva, I chose Ancient Magic Script and Spirit Languages as my study.\"\nIf nobles in this country wrote letters in Ancient Magic Script and exchanged words with spirits, Monica's knowledge would have been very useful. But of course, neither of these was knowledge required by the children of nobles.\n\"What should I do, What should I do, What should I do.\"\nMonica sat on the bed, hugging Nero to her chest whimpering.\nNow Monica was no longer in a position to protect the second prince. All she could do was try not to drop out of this school.\nNo, even before that…\n\"Today, I received kindness from two people.\"\nMonica glanced at the ribbon on her desk and the wrapped nuts.\nDespite Lana's high-handed attitude, she was the first person in her class who talked to her.\nAnd the young man she met in the old garden, he had prioritized picking up Monica's nuts over his documents.\n\"Actually, I wanted to say \"Thank you\" to them, but…\"\nShe could point out the mistakes in the documents, but because she was unable to say thank you properly, she felt what she did was so ungrateful.\nMonica turned her gaze down, and Nero looked up at Monica.\n\"You were able to say \"thank you\" to me just fine. You just said that. I heard it myself.\"\n\"It was because… you're… not a human…\"\nNero frowned like a human being, but then he suddenly had an idea, wagged his tail, and climbed down from Monica's lap.\n\"All right, then, I'll help you practice overcoming your shyness.\"\n\"Nero? Are you talking about\nthat\n…\"\n\"Yes. That's right.\"\nNero jumped onto the chair and gave a flick of his tail. Instantly, his figure contorted and the black cat became a mass of black shadows. Eventually, the shadow expanded and became a human silhouette.\nWithin two blinks of an eye, the shadow now took on color. As if the ink had been washed away, a smooth skin tone could be seen beneath the shadow.\n\"Look, how's that.\"\nThe person sitting in the chair was not a black cat, but a young man in his twenties with black hair and golden eyes. He was wearing a somewhat old-fashioned robe.\nOf course, he wasn't human. He was Nero who had transformed into a human form.\nShe already knew that Nero could turn into a human being, and she'd seen him do it, but… her body cowered of its own accord at the realization that there was an adult male in front of her.\n\"N-No…\"\nHer eyes, which always looking down blankly, were opened to the limit, and her body was trembling.\nShe shrank back on the bed and held her head in her hands as if to protect herself.\n\"No… I don't want it… I beg you, Nero… Please turn back into a cat…\"\nShe looked as if she was about to burst into tears, while Nero puffed out his cheeks in frustration. When he did so, he looked awfully young for a grown man.\n\"Don't wanna. I mean, you can manage to talk to Lulu Runtatta, even with a slight stutter!\"\nApparently, Nero was not interested in remembering Louis Miller's name.\nFor the time being, Monica insisted, correcting his mistake with Louis' name.\n\"Louis will slap me on the cheek if I don't answer him properly. In the worst cases, he would slap me back and forth!\"\n\"Whoa… are you serious? He is the worst. Well, but I'm not gonna slap you! How about that? Ain't I pretty nice?\"\nNormally, it should be like that, but Louis was just being radical.\nEven so, Nero snorted proudly then cornered Monica.\n\"Now express your gratitude, worship me, and say thank you to me.\"\nAs Nero crept closer and closer, Monica was leaning back while repeatedly opening and closing up her mouth.\n\"T-Tha… T-Tha… k…\"\nAfter barely spelling out a word, Monica's mouth began to mumble words that didn't make sense, then followed by a series of ragged breaths. Looking at her from the outside, she looked like a sick person.\nNero pouted his lips like a child in frustration.\n\"Oh, really? So you didn't want to thank me for infiltrating the school and helping out with the investigation? Oh, I'm super shocked. I feel hurt!\"\n\"No, you got it wrong, I'm sorry…\"\n\"I'd rather hear a thank you than a sorry. Come on, give your familiar some praise, master.\"\nNero then proceeded to loll his feet around on the chair in an ill-mannered manner.\nMonica shut her eyes tightly, clenched her fists in her lap, and squeezed her voice out.\n\"T-Thanks for everything, Nero!\"\n\"Oh, that's nice, keep going, keep going. Okay, now say ‘Lord Nero, you're the best!'\"\n\"Lord Nero, you're the best!\"\n\"Now, Lord Nero, you're so wonderful~!\"\n\"Lord Nero, you're so wonderful!\"\nSeeing Monica's eyes became swirly as she recited, Nero rubbed his cheeks.\n\"I'm starting to feel like the bad guy who's brainwashing the good guys.\"\n\"You're so mean, Nero…\"\n\"Meow! I was just doing it for your own good… hm?\"\nTurning his golden eyes to look out the window, Nero opened it and leaned in.\nMonica hurriedly pulled at the hem of Nero's clothes.\n\"N-Nero! T-That's dangerous. You'll fall…\"\n\"Hey, Monica, look. There's a guy in the boys' dormitory window. He looks suspicious.\"\n\"Eh?\"\nMonica leaned out the window alongside Nero and turned her attention to the adjacent boys' dormitory.\nThe windows in the attic were high enough to provide them a good view, but relying on moonlight alone was still too unreliable.\nMonica activated her night vision and farsightedness magic with no chanting. This magic did not strengthen her eyesight but rather created a vision in her mind of a scene at some distance.\nThere's someone in the boys' dorm yard.\nIn Monica's mind, a picture of the boys' dormitory appeared. Focusing her attention further, she could see a person coming out of the first-floor window of the boys' dormitory.\nHe was wearing a hooded cloak over his head, so his face was not visible. However, through the hood, his black hair could be seen swaying in the air.\nHe was tall and slender and wore a fine frock coat under his cloak.\nHe stepped out of the first-floor window into the garden and disappeared among the trees.\n\"He's gone out of sight. Can't you do something about it with your magic?\"\n\"My far sight is not clairvoyant. Once they're hidden behind an obstacle, I can't track them any further, but…\"\nMonica put her finger on her chin and squinted her eyes.\nRight now, in Monica's mind, calculations were coming and going at a dizzying pace.\nIn those calculations, Monica learned one fact.\n\"I've met that person before…\"",

      "content": "In the attic, there were no curtains, so when the morning sun came, it would shine directly into the room.\nWhen Monica woke up, she took the coffee pot out of her luggage bag before fixing her appearance.\nWhen Monica left her cabin, the only things she packed in her luggage bag were a coffee pot, a mill, coffee beans, and her black cat, Nero. Having lived her life without interacting with people, she hardly has anything important.\nShe activated her no-chanting spell and filled the coffee pot with drinking water.\nWater that has been produced by spells cannot be used for drinking because it contains a small amount of mana. Since the human body can't store too much mana, consuming a large amount of water containing mana will lead to mana poisoning. That's why Monica usually fetches water from a well.\nHowever, a small amount would not be a problem. As a Seventh Sage, Monica has a higher tolerance for mana than most people. So she will not easily suffer from mana poisoning.\nMonica poured that water into the pot, ground the coffee beans in the mill, and set them in the pot.\nHe also took out a small iron tripod, placed a pot on it, then started a fire with no chanting spell.\nTo maintain a certain level of firepower and positional coordinates, some precise techniques, and manipulations were required.\nNero, who had been lazily lounging on the bed in the form of a black cat, looked at Monica in exasperation.\n\"Aren't you wasting too much of your skill, using that just for a coffee?\"\n\"A-After all… I can't just use the kitchen without permission.\"\nAfter making excuses in a low voice, Monica poured a cup of coffee from the pot.\nThe hot, bitter coffee flowing over her tongue woke her up with a clear head.\nSuddenly, the words of her late father came to her mind.\n——Start by cutting down on the useless things. Then, the remaining number will be quite simple.\nWhat did he mean by useless things, I wonder.\nFor example, to Monica, coffee in the morning was not a useless thing, it was an important thing. But to someone who doesn't like coffee, it may seem useless.\nIf it was a mathematical equation, I'd know the answer right away.\nDeciding the things that considered \"useless things\" in people's minds was very difficult.\nMonica puffed into her cup and glanced at the ribbon and nuts still on the desk.\nUntil now, Monica had never cared about her hair. So, if it had been the Monica of the past, she would have been able to say that ribbons were a useless thing.\nIt was the same with the nuts. She was not very interested in eating, so if she didn't have any nuts, she would just skip lunch altogether.\nMonica picked some nuts from her desk and chewed on them. She didn't usually taste them, but now she felt like eating them with much delicacy, so she tasted them thoroughly and swallowed them.\n\"Hey, what kind of things that considered not useless things to you, Nero?\"\n\"Oh? What's up? What's with the philosophical questions all of a sudden? Wow, am I smart and cool enough to know the word \"philosophical\"? Praise me!\"\n\"Yeah, great, great.\"\nWhen Monica complimented him crudely, Nero said, \"I got it!\" then pointed at Monica with his right paw.\n\"For me, your compliments are not useless things. So praise me more! Praise me! If you want, write a ballad, write a novel, paint a portrait for all posterity!\"\nThe last part was quite absurd, but the fact that Monica's compliment was not a useless thing to Nero made Monica a little happier.\n\"Glad… to hear that…\"\n\"Also, it's better to enjoy useless things… ‘Life is full of waste. Then why don't we enjoy it?' Dustin Günther wrote about it in one of his novels.\"\nFor Monica, who was struggling to survive, enjoying useless things was quite a challenge.\nEven then…\n\"I… I'll give it a shot…\"\nWith that, Monica picked up the ribbon on her desk.\n——You know, Monica, the harder the challenge, the more fun it becomes.\nThe words of her late father came back gently to Monica.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nLana Colette was sitting in her seat, resting her head on her hand and flipping through a thin booklet. Her hairstyle and hair ornaments were different from yesterday.\nMonica checked Lana's appearance and approached her, berating her trembling legs.\n\"Um…\"\n\"What?\"\nKept facing the booklet, she moved her eyes to look at Monica. Then, her eyes widened.\n\"What the heck with that hairstyle!?\"\nMonica's hairstyle was not like the one Lana had done for her yesterday, nor was it her usual pigtails.\nIt was an avant-garde hairstyle, with unnaturally bulging-out hair on top of her head along two pigtails forcibly affixed to it.\n\"Um, I wanted to do it like you did for me yesterday.\"\n\"Even your pigtails were still better than\nthis\nhairstyle!\"\n\"……huh?\"\nAfter being yelled at by Lana, Monica pulled a ribbon with a pin from her pocket and offered it to Lana.\n\"Umm… thank you… very much… for what you did yesterday.\"\nRemembering her practice with Nero yesterday, Monica thanked him in a faint voice.\nHer speech sounded like she was about to die, but she managed to finish it.\nHowever, when Lana saw the ribbon Monica offered her, she snorted and turned away.\n\"I don't want it. That stuff's not popular anymore.\"\nLana's brusque attitude prevented any further conversation.\nIf it had been the usual Monica, she would have just backed off here.\nBut Monica stayed there, struggling to squeeze out her voice.\n\"C-Can you teach me… H-How to do it like yeshterday?\"\nShe bit her tongue.\nMonica, who was facing down completely red up to her ears, didn't notice that.\nLana's mouth was twitching as if she was trying to hold in her laughter.\n\"I-It can't be helped! Come on, sit down here!\"\nLana said haughtily then pointed using her chin.\nMonica did as she was told, brought her own chair and sat down on it, and Lana quickly undid Monica's hair.\n\"Gosh, how did you manage to get such a strange haircut, I wonder! It's just unbelievable! Hey, do you have a comb?\"\n\"N-No.\"\nWhen Monica said it in a weak voice, Lana tugged on Monica's hair.\n\"You don't even have that and now you say you want to learn from me?\"\n\"I-I'm sorry…\"\nLana gave an exasperated sigh before she brought out her own comb. The fine silvery comb with its delicate clear carving was, upon closer inspection, adorned with small jewels.\n\"Until recently, gold-work combs with large jewels were popular, but the latest trend is definitely this one. Smaller jewels scattered discreetly are cute. The craftsmen in the Ammer region are especially skilled with these kinds of things, so if you want to buy a first-class product, you should buy one made in Ammer…\"\nFor some reason, Lana clammed up there and started brushing Monica's hair in silence.\nAs Monica wondered why she had suddenly gone silent, Lana muttered in a low voice that only Monica could hear.\n\"Isn't my story boring?\"\nAt the somewhat sullen muttering, Monica rounded her eyes and looked up at Lana behind her.\nLana's lips were bent into \"へ\", and she looked somewhat hurt.\n\"After all, I was just an upstart who bought a title with money. You probably think my story is vulgar and not worth listening to, don't you?\"\n\"Er, um…\"\nMonica fumbled with her hands for no reason struggling to speak.\n\"I-I too, am often told that I'm boring… b-because I always talk mostly about numbers…\"\nWhen it came to numbers and formulas, she could talk as long as she wanted, but she would tend to forget to look at the other person's reaction and keep on talking.\nBecause of that, Louis Miller had slapped her over more than once. That good-looking magician would slap her mercilessly on the cheek and say \" My colleague, are you back to being human?\" in a smile.\nShivering as she recalled that moment, Lana let out a small sigh.\n\"What's that? That's weird.\"\n\"I-Is that so?\"\n\"Of course. Now, turn your face here.\"\nLana parted Monica's hair in two and swiftly braided it. At this point, the key to making it cute was to make the braid a little loose. Then, cross the slightly loosened braid to the left and right, hide the hair ends, and pin it in place.\n\"There you go. This is easy, you know.\"\n\"Wow… you did it so fast… is it related to how the pins are positioned? …no, maybe the way you position the braids and distribute the amount of hair also play an important role…\"\n\"You have to learn these things by hand, not by numbers. Now, try to do it yourself.\"\nMonica's eyes widened at Lana's words and she exclaimed in a hysterical voice.\n\"Eh!? It had become this beautiful… and y-you want me to unravel it…?\"\nThe words \"It had become this beautiful\" caused Lana's mood to improve and turned her mouth into a smile, but with the looks of a big sister, she coughed then looked over at Monica.\n\"If you don't do it yourself, you'll never learn. And if you screw up, I'll fix it for you, so go ahead and try.\"\n\"Uh… It's like taking apart a beautiful, complete mathematical equation then turning it into some crappy equation.\"\n\"What kind of description is that?\"\nJust as Lana laughed in half exasperation and half satisfaction, the classroom suddenly began to buzz.\nIt was still too early for the teacher to arrive. When Monica looked at the center of the buzz, she saw a male student.\nHe was a slender male student with long platinum blond hair tied up in a single knot. With each step he took, the crowd, mostly female students, became more and more excited.\nBehind Monica, Lana blurted out.\n\"He is Cyril Ashley, the student council vice president. Why did he come to our class?\"\nIf he was the student council vice-president, he must be the second prince's closest aide. However, as far as Monica knew, there shouldn't be any student council members in this class.\nA tense atmosphere hung in the air around Cyril. It was not a vague atmosphere, but a faint oozing of mana. And perhaps it was ice mana.\nCould it be that he was someone who was born with a high amount of mana? Did he leak his mana intentionally? Or did he just not have control over his mana?\nWhile she was thinking about this, Cyril stood at the podium and announced in a calm but clear voice.\n\"Is there a female student in this class named Monica Norton?\"\nAll the eyes of her classmates focused on Monica at once.\nMonica half-reflexively crawled under the desk. If it were possible, she would have gone under Lana's skirt. She thought it was a bad idea, so she pulled himself together, but before she could look for another place to hide, Lana hurriedly pulled Monica's arm.\n\"Hey, silly girl, what are you doing! The vice president wants to see you!\"\n\"I… I'm not here! That's right, skipping! Today, I'll be skipping!\"\nCyril walked up to Monica quickly and stared down at Monica, who was clinging to the leg of the desk, teary-eyed and talking nonsense. He's scary! He's scary, but if it were Louis Miller, he would have kicked the desk and smashed his fist into Monica's head. He'd absolutely do that. Compared to that, he's somewhat better, maybe.\n\"Are you Monica Norton?\"\n\"…yesh.\"\nWhen Monica answered in sobbing, Cyril wrinkled his brow in discomfort.\n\"I don't understand. Why would His Highness want to take… this little girl?\"\nMurmuring bitterly, Cyril coughed lightly before glaring at Monica.\n\"Come with me.\"\n\"Um, our class… is about to start…\"\n\"Are you defying me?\"\nMonica, who was vulnerable to overbearing attitudes, shuddered before obeyed at Cyril's words… She was crawling under the desk while dragging it with a rattling motion.\nAfter a few steps, Cyril bellowed at her.\n\"Why are you still following me hiding under the desk!?\"\n\"B-But you're scaring me…\"\n\"Leave that desk now…\"\n\"I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\"\nMonica apologized and returned the desk to its original position, then wrapped herself around the curtains.\nCyril and his classmates watched the scene in amazement, but eventually, Cyril ripped off the curtain and dragged Monica out.\n\"You! Why are you hiding behind the curtains?\"\n\"I… I was just wondering if I could hide from you like this…\"\n\"Don't joke with me!\"\nCyril chanted a spell in rapid succession. Just by listening to his chanting, Monica understood the meaning of the magic formula.\nThis spell…\nWith Monica's no-chant magic, she can immediately activate a counter-technique. If she wanted, she could attack before Cyril's spell could be activated.\nBut if she did that, Monica's true identity would be exposed.\nCyril snapped his fingers. Then an ice chain extended from the tip of his index finger and entwined itself around Monica's wrist before turned into a handcuff.\nIt was an ice spell intended to shackle her. If Monica resisted, the mechanism contained in the handcuff would immediately freeze her.\nCyril, who had restrained Monica with an ice handcuff, had a dangerous smile on his face. His dark blue eyes glittered with anger.\n\"It appears I have been ordered to capture a rare beast… For a rare beast, it's only natural to use a chain, right?\"\nWhy can't both Louis Miller and Cyril Ashley treat Monica like a human being?\nThus, Monica was taken away by Cyril Ashley, who treated her like a freak show.",

      "content": "Just before her wrists were bound by Cyril Ashley's ice chains, Monica had activated her no-chant magic.\nThe spell contained a very thin protective barrier incorporated with a concealment spell to prevent him from noticing her magic. In other words, Monica was using her magic without his notice to protect her wrists, especially so that she would not get frostbitten.\nThis person is probably at least an intermediate-level magician… No, perhaps he has already reached the advanced level.\nThe chains that bound Monica's wrists were sturdy and intricately constructed. It was a feat that no low-level magician could pull off.\nThe only thing that bothered Monica was the cold air that Cyril was constantly emitting from his entire body. While standing next to him she felt a slight chill in the air, when she distanced herself the chill was so weak that it didn't bother her. This person would be very useful to have in the room on a hot day.\n\"E-Er… u-um… w-where are you… g-going to take me to…?\"\nMonica who has met Cyril that has such a high-handed attitude had a difficult speaking after meeting him for the first time.\nCyril looked over at Monica and frowned uncomfortably.\n\"Stop your nonsense. Just shut up and follow me.\"\n\"I-I'm sorry…\"\n\"Is that way of speaking supposed to be making fun of me?\"\nThe cold air surrounding Cyril grew a little stronger. The air was both intimidating and chilling, causing a shiver to run through her body as her neck felt a shudder.\n\"The person you are about to meet is a noble one, whom a little girl with a commoner's aura like you would never be able to meet even if you had run laps around the garden handstand while barking.\"\nWho would want to meet a freak who circles the yard a hundred times handstand while barking? Or so Monica thought, keeping her mouth shut.\nEventually, Cyril stopped in front of a magnificent door on the fourth floor.\nHe then snapped his fingers, causing the ice chains that bound Monica's wrists to dissipate as if they were melting into the air.\n\"Please refrain from showing any disrespect.\"\nAfter warned Monica, Cyril knocked on the door.\n\"I have brought Monica Norton with me.\"\n\"Come in.\"\nAfter neatly retracting his previous haughty attitude, Cyril opened the door in a graceful manner and motioned Monica to come inside.\n\"E-Excuse m-me…\"\nInside such a large room, a scarlet carpet was spread over it. All the rooms in Serendia Academy were much more extravagant than those in ordinary schools, but this room stood out among them all.\nIn the back of such a room, a male student was sitting in front of the office desk.\nIt was a young man with honey blonde hair that shines in the light coming through the window and beautiful eyes that look like blue mixed with a little bit of green.\n\"I'm sorry to call you unannounced, Miss Monica Norton.\"\n\"Y-You are… the person… from yesterday…\"\nAnd that young man who had picked up Monica's nuts in the old garden was looking at her with the same gentle smile he had then.\nWhen Cyril saw Monica dazed in surprise, he then glares at her.\n\"How dare you show that mannerism to him! Do you know who this man is?\"\n\"Cyril, would you excuse us for a moment?\"\nThe blond youth said calmly, but Cyril shouted, \"You must not!\" in an urgent voice.\n\"I couldn't leave you alone with this strange girl. If anything happens to you…\"\n\"Thank you for your concern. But I'm fine.\"\n\"But…\"\nAs Cyril continued to insist, the young man narrowed his eyes just a little.\nHis calm expression remained intact, but just by narrowing his eyes slightly, causing Cyril to feel an invisible pressure.\n\"Do you not trust me?\"\n\"That's not true! I believe in you more than anyone!\"\n\"Then, did you take my feelings into it? You know, I hate wasting time with these useless arguments.\"\nIn response to Cyril's desperate plea, the blond-haired young man said in a calm manner. However, when he said the last word, it was low and heavy.\n\"Please forgive me, I've overstepped my bounds.\"\nCyril bowed deeply and walked out of the room, just before he closed the door… he glared at Monica with eyes so sharp as if he were going to shoot her to death.\nConfirming that the door was closed, the blond young man then smiled at Monica.\n\"Did you have eaten your lunch properly, little squirrel?\"\n\"Um… T-Thank you very much… f-for helping me at that time.\"\nI did it. I am able to thanks him properly.\nMonica's goal for today was to say her thanks to Lana and this young man for yesterday. Having accomplished that goal so quickly, she was delighted inwardly.\nIn response to Monica, the young man smiled kindly and lifted a stack of papers on his desk.\n\"I'm sorry to call you unannounced, but I had something I really wanted to talk to you about.\"\n\"W-What could it be?\"\nIn her mind, Monica was afraid that he would ask her how she got in and out of the old garden, but the young man said, \"here,\" and showed her a document. It was numbers that were familiar to her. It turned out to be the document Monica had picked up yesterday.\n\"You said yesterday that there were thirty-nine flaws in this?\"\nWhen Monica nodded weakly, the young man dropped his papers on the desk.\n\"You were right. I could only find thirty-eight flaws, but when I reviewed them carefully, it turned out there are thirty-nine flaws as you said before. As student council president, I'd like to thank you.\"\n\"N-No. I-It's not necessary…\"\nHearing his compliments honestly made Monica felt delighted. While squirming and kneading her fingers in embarrassment, she suddenly noticed the inexplicable word before slowly lifted her head.\n\"You… are student council… president?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nThe young man nodded with a smiling face, stood up quietly then gracefully bowed in front of Monica.\n\"I apologize for the delay in identifying myself. I'm Felix Ark Ridill, the 75th student council president of Serendia Academy. It's a pleasure to meet you, little squirrel.\"\n\"………\"\nThe kind boy who picked up the nuts for her yesterday was actually the student council president.\nIn other words, he was the second prince and the target of Monica's protection.\nThe moment Monica understood that fact, she thought…\n\"Thank goodness…\"\nIt was one word.\nBut as Monica patted her chest with relief, a question popped up in Felix's mind before he tilted his head.\n\"What makes you feel relieved?\"\n\"Oh, well, yesterday I saw you leaving the boys' dormitory in disguise… I thought that person who kindly picked up the nuts was a bad person who wanted to kill His Highness, but if it was His Highness himself, then I'm relieved.\"\n\"……..\"\n\"……ah.\"\nMonica held her mouth as quickly as she could, but it was too late.\nIn Monica's mind, there's Louis Miller who said, \"That was a pretty loose tongue you got there. Why don't you change your title from the [Silent Witch] to the [Gibberish Witch], my colleague?\" then laughed loudly. That's how fatal her slip tongue was.\n\"Hey, I wonder where did you see that?\"\nAt Felix's words, Monica felt a rush of sweat break out all over her body.\nIt would be another matter to saw him during the daytime, but observing the boys' dormitory windows from the girls' dormitory window at night when there's no light was very difficult. Unless one has night vision like Nero or casting night vision and farsightedness spells like Monica, it would be impossible.\n\"Can I take your statement as an indication that you have been sneaking out of the girls' dormitory in the middle of the night and wandering around outside the boys' dormitory?\"\n\"No, y-you've got it wrong. I just happened to see it when I opened my window…\"\n\"I believe last night was a moonless night. Thanks to that, the stars looked more beautiful.\"\nIn a roundabout way, he told her that she wouldn't be able to see him from the window because it was too dark.\nAs Monica's mouth repeatedly closing and opening, Felix took a step closer with a smile on his face.\n\"So you saw someone leaving the boys' dormitory at night? Indeed, that could have been a suspicious person. But that wasn't me, though. Could you describe what that person looks like? Also, I think we need to tighten up security at the school.\"\n\"I… I couldn't see his face because he was wearing a hooded cloak. B-But I did catch a glimpse of his dark hair.\"\nAt Monica's words, Felix chuckled and pinched his honey blonde with his fingers.\nOr perhaps what he meant was to prove it in a way of how scholars do.\n\"Y-You can always dye your hair or wear a wig to cover it up, but…\"\n\"But?\"\nMonica clenched her fists and assured Felix, who calmly urged her to go on.\n\"The dark-haired man from yesterday and His Highness… h-have the same body sizes.\"\n\"You know, it's not uncommon for people to have similar body sizes.\"\n\"It's not similar, it's the golden ratio!\"\n\"…huh?\"\nOnce Monica was set on fire, instead of retracting her stuttering habit, she had a bad habit of losing sight of her surroundings. And now it was like that.\nJust in time, there was a movable blackboard on the wall for the meeting. Monica drew a simple picture of a human figure on it and drew a rectangle at the head.\n\"I am confident in my ability to accurately guess the length of most things I see. For starters, the shape of Your Highness's head had a horizontal to vertical ratio of 1:1.618. This number is a golden ratio that humans find to be the closest thing to be the most beautiful. The more accurate number of the golden ratio is 1:1.61803398… It goes on and on, but I won't go into it here. The person I saw last night was wearing a hood, so I can't measure the exact number, but if I do a rough calculation based on what I can see above the hood, it fits this number!\"\n\"………\"\nWithout paying attention to Felix's reaction, Monica drew a horizontal line at the navel of the picture on the blackboard. In other words, it looked like a diagram of the human body divided into upper and lower parts. She wrote \"1\" above the navel and \"1.618\" below the navel.\n\"Even with clothes on, the length of the legs can be used to determine the approximate position of the navel. And the ratio of the upper half to the lower half of the torso of last night's person and Your Highness was also in this golden ratio when the torso was divided at the navel. What's more! When the lower body is set to 1, the total length of the upper and lower body is 1.618. It's like everything has been calculated in the golden ratio! People like this don't pop up very often! If I could get it measured with a measuring tape, my theory would prove to be… cor… rect…\"\nMonica, who had been breathing hard, finally came to her senses.\nWhat have I done…\nAs Monica wobbled in front of him, still clutching the chalk, Felix was…\n\"The last time I took measurements, the numbers were…\" mumbled casually and did some calculations.\nThen, with a satisfied look on his face, he clapped his hands.\n\"Oh, It's really 1:1.6.\"\n\"………\"\n\"I have received many compliments on my appearance, but this is the first time I have been complimented in this way.\"\nHearing his tone was somewhat amused rather than sarcastic made Monica to be greatly perplexed. And so she frantically racked her brain for excuses, trying to think and think again, then… after much hesitation, she came up with this excuse.\n\"The golden spiral is based on the golden ratio, which has a radius of Fioretti's sequence. This is a very beautiful number sequence that was discovered by a mathematician named Fioretti about six hundred years ago! How can it not be beautiful!\"\nDid she intent to follow up with this kind of excuse?\nIf Louis Miller had been here, he would have been grinding her head with a long lecture, but Felix just smiled then looked over at Monica.\n\"You praised the sequence more than I did, didn't you?\"\n\"I-I-I'm sorryyyyyyy!\"\n\"So, you're not going to deny it?\"\nShe knew that it would be disrespectful if she nodded here.\nStill, Monica can't betray the \"numbers\".\n\"I don't know of anything more beautiful than numbers…\"\nFelix let out a breath and brushed his slightly long bangs lightly.\n\"In honor of your enthusiasm for numbers, I will give you an honest answer. The dark-haired person you saw yesterday was me. I was sneaking out of the school to have some fun at night.\"\n\"H-Have some fun at night?\"\nMonica's idea of having fun at night was drinking in a sparkling restaurant with a beautiful lady. Is that mean, his highness is doing that too?\nTo be honest, Monica wasn't interested in how this second prince was playing around, but since he was the subject of her protection, she couldn't just overlook it. If someone attacked him while he was out having fun at night, it would be a disaster.\n\"Wouldn't it become a huge problem if the second prince was caught sneaking out and having fun at night? I hope you can keep this secret between us. If you do, I won't ask where you were watching me from last night.\"\nOf course, she had no intention of telling anyone, so Monica nodded vigorously.\nOh, thank goodness. Looks like I won't be blamed and expelled from the school.\nFelix took Monica's hand, which was secretly patting her chest, in a very natural gesture. Monica's whole body instantly tensed up and her body began to shaking slightly.\n\"Um… I-Is there something else… you need from me?\"\n\"Yep, I'm not sure you're worth sharing a secret with me, so… let me see if you deserve my trust.\"\nWith that, Felix held Monica's hand as his blue eyes gleaming mysteriously.",

      "content": "While holding her arm, Felix led her to the archive room where was right next to the student council room.\nThey're lockable beautiful cabinets where documents were packed tightly inside.\n\"The cabinet on the back is the name list of previous students, next to it is the name list of current students, and next to that is the name list of our teachers. And this is all the event-related documents.\"\nFelix explained what was stored on each of the cabinets, and stopped in front of the rightmost shelf.\n\"Here is the accounting cabinet.\"\nFelix pulled a bunch of keys out of his jacket pocket, unlocked a cabinet, then took out some documents.\nIn that place, some desks and chairs have been placed in for working. Felix put the documents there then looked at Monica with a smile.\n\"I wanted to ask you to review our accounting records for the past five years.\"\nMost people would have frowned at him, wondering why they had to do that.\nBut Monica couldn't help but itch for those accounting records in front of her.\nAfter all, the works that had been piling up in her mountain cabin were being assigned to other people by Louis Miller.\nSo right now, Monica was hungry for numbers.\n\"Um, a-am I really allowed to do this…?\"\nHearing her eager voice with unconcealed joy, Felix nodded and said, \"Of course\" to her.\n\"If you're worried about your class, I can talk to your teacher. I hope you could finish it before lunch… so is that okay if I leave it all to you?\"\n\"Yes!\"\nAs soon as she replied, Monica started flipping through the ledger with enthusiasm.\nIt's been a long time since she does this, so her eyes were shining brightly right now.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nWell then…\nAfter looking at Monica who began to review the ledger from the side, Felix casually dropped the bundle of keys from his pocket.\nThere was a slight clinking sound, but Monica didn't seem to notice. But he thought since he had dropped it at the place between the work desk and the file cabinets, she would surely notice it when she was moving to the cabinets.\nSo Felix left the student council room, leaving Monica in the archives.\nIn the hallway, Cyril Ashley was waiting earnestly right outside the door.\nThe student council room has been designed to be soundproofed, so for one to be eavesdropping was difficult, but even so, he had already expected Cyril knew some of their conversations after sticking his ear to the wall.\n\"Your Highness, that little girl…\"\n\"I assigned her one task.\"\nThe moment Felix said those words, Cyril's taken aback with his eyes widened to their limit. When Cyril was not talking, he's actually quite charming, if you combined it with a cool and intelligent face, but his emotions were too volatile.\n\"Your Highness, if there's a job to be done, why did you have to ask such a little girl… If you give me an order, I, Cyril Ashley, will certainly complete it.\"\n\"Do you have any confidence to review all those records of five years' worth by lunchtime?\"\nCyril choked on his words with a grunt but quickly answered with a tightened expression.\n\"If that's what Your Highness ordered…\"\nBoth Felix and Cyril know the sheer volume of those records. If they started working on it now, they would just barely be able to finish by lunchtime.\nThose who were used to managing student council documents might be able to make it, otherwise, they would need at least another half day.\n\"Your Highness, could it be that… are you sure you want someone, not from the student council like that little girl to review our accounting records?\"\nCyril's brow furrowed in confusion, but he soon seemed to realize something, and then his face lit up.\n\"I see! So this is punishment for that little girl who disrespected you, Your Highness! If she doesn't make it in time, she can be subject to punishment for disobeying your orders!\"\nFelix neither said it was right or wrong, but he only calmly instructed Cyril.\n\"I think she would not be able to attend her morning classes. Could you please inform Miss Monica Norton's homeroom teacher that I will be borrowing her for a moment?\"\n\"At once!\"\nCyril, who had been ordered to do his job, headed for the staff room with a nimble gait that made him look like he was about to skip.\nWhile Felix was watching him off with a smile, a small little voice came from his chest.\n\"Are you sure about this?\"\nFrom Felix's breast pocket, a small lizard peeked out with only its head. The lizard had white scales with a light blue tint and dark blue eyes. It's a color that would never be possible for a normal lizard.\nMoving only his eyes, Felix looked down at the lizard in his breast pocket.\n\"Are you having any doubts?\"\nThe lizard moved its smallmouth and whispered to Felix.\nFelix chuckled through his throat.\n\"Will, what do you think of Miss Monica Norton?\"\n\"I think she's an odd little girl.\"\n\"Well, that's true, but… what's important is which side is she on.\"\nMonica Norton had gone into the off-limits old garden and even saw Felix sneaking out of the boys' dormitory at night. It's hard to believe that she was just a regular person who happened to be there.\n\"I can think of three possibilities. The first is that my grandfather sent her to look after me. Second, His Majesty sent him to protect me. Third, she was an assassin who came to kill me.\"\n\"I have some doubt with the first and second options. Also, Duke Crockford and His Majesty won't send someone like that to look after you. After all, she was… well, you know…\"\nYes. anyone who saw her would think of her as a clumsy person.\nAnd Duke Crockford would never use such an incompetent. Neither would His Majesty the King.\nTherefore, the most plausible was the third option—Monica Norton was the assassin who wanted to kill Felix…\n\"For a person who had targeted my life, the way she did her acts is way too crude.\"\n\"Indeed…\"\n\"She didn't even know what I looked like in the first place.\"\nIf Monica Norton was an assassin who wanted to kill Felix, she should have attacked him when they met in the old garden.\nTo top it all off, when Monica saw Felix sneaking out of the boys' dormitory, she made a huge slip of the tongue and said, \"I thought you were an assassin who tries to kill His Highness.\"\n\"Your Highness, what if… she's really just a schoolgirl who doesn't know anything?\"\n\"I still inspecting her at the moment.\"\nIf Monica Norton has come to this school for any purpose, she will surely try rummaging the documents in the archives using the key that Felix had dropped.\n\"All the doors of those file cabinets in the archives are covered with ultra-thin threads on. If she tried to open its door, I'll know it right away.\"\nIf Monica had used the key she had picked up to rummage through the documents in the cabinets, Felix would know immediately which documents Monica after.\nThat's why Felix told Monica exactly what the documents were in each cabinet.\n\"Well, let's wait for lunchtime, shall we? Once lunchtime comes, we'll be able to shed her hide.\"\n\"What if it doesn't come off?\"\nWhen the white lizard asked, Felix, narrowed his blue eyes and smiled.\n\"I'm rather fond of small animals. Wouldn't it be fun to have one in the student council room?\"\nIt's hard to tell if Felix was joking or serious when he said it, but the white lizard slipped into the back of his pocket, then…\n\"…I might not able to turn you into a small animal. But I will try my best to turn you into a similar one.\"\nFelix laughed aloud which was unusual for him, then left the place with a light step.",

      "content": "There are three princes in the Kingdom of Ridill, but as of who will be the next king, the current king has yet to declare.\nCurrently, there was a strong movement among the nobles in the country to make the second prince, Felix, the next king.\nAfter all, Felix had the backing of Duke Crockford's family, and his power was growing stronger by the day. If the power of the second prince's faction continued to grow, Felix would surely become the king.\nThat's why many young ladies from noble families have their eyes set on becoming Felix's fiance.\nCompared to the unrefined first prince and the inconspicuous third prince, the second prince, Felix, possessed outstanding good looks. There were many girls who fell in love with him at the first sight upon seeing him.\nFor this reason, there were often girls wandering around the student council room, hoping to catch a glimpse of Felix. It's the same now. A few girls were gathered in a huddle, waiting gingerly for Felix to arrive.\nAs the girls gathered around, one of the girls approached from behind.\nIt was a student named Bridgette Graham, the daughter of Marquis Sheilberry.\nListed as one of the three most beautiful women in Serendia Academy, she coldly turned her beautiful face to the girls and told them.\n\"You're blocking me from getting through. Could you clear the way?\"\nWith that comment, the girls dropped their heads in shame and walked away.\nBridget has excellent grades and has always been in the top three for three years in the academy. And she was particularly gifted in the field of foreign languages, where she ranked alongside Prince Felix, who has the highest overall score.\nWith her perfect appearance and family background, and being a childhood friend of Prince Felix, people around her naturally saw her as a potential fiance for Prince Felix.\nAbove all, Bridget was a student council member who had appointed directly by Felix. She was the only girl in the current student council that he had appointed. That was Bridget. A person that Felix trusts so much.\n\"Oh?\"\nTurning the doorknob of the student council room, Bridget furrowed her brow. The door was unlocked. She stepped into the room, wondering a bit if she would be the first one in today.\nThere was no sign of anyone in the student council room, but… she could hear a faint noise coming from the adjacent archive room. Bridget looked into the archives to see if anyone was working there… and was struck dumb for a scene what she saw.\nOne of the cabinets in the archive room was empty, and documents were piled up on the floor.\nAnd at a work desk in the back of the room, a girl with light brown hair she didn't recognize was quietly reading a document.\n\"Who are you? With whose permission did you enter this room?\"\nEven after Bridget called out to her, her petite back didn't even budge.\n\"Answer me right away.\"\nEven after speaking in a strong tone, the girl still did not respond.\nJust as Bridget was about to raise her voice even higher, two boys appeared behind her. Both of them were from the student council.\n\"Oh, so Miss Bridget is the first one to arrive today… What the heck is this?!\"\n\"How could all the documents are… Um, who is that person over there?\"\nThe tall young man with reddish brown-colored hair was Elliot, the secretary, and the small boy with light brown hair was Neil, the general affairs assistant.\nElliot looked at Brigitte and smiled a troubled smile.\n\"Uh, who's the girl over there? Is she one of your friends, Miss Bridget?\"\nInstead of replying, Bridget stared at Elliot with golden eyes that glittered like a wildcat's.\nElliot cowered, \"How scary,\" and immediately corrected his words.\n\"Well, I guess she's not your friend. I mean, Miss Bridget doesn't have any friends…\"\n\"From her attires, she's a sophomore like me… But I've never seen her before.\"\nNeil, who had been hiding in Elliot's shadow to see what was going on, took one step closer to the desk and called out to the girl's back.\n\"Um, excuse me. May I ask your name?\"\nAs expected, there was no response, and the girl still silently flipped through the pages of the document, occasionally writing numbers on a small piece of paper and tucking it into the document. Her eyes were always on the documents, never looking back at them.\nWhile Elliot and Neil were at a loss, Bridget raised the fan in her hand and… swung it down on the girl's cheek.\nPah! The girl's movements stopped for a moment as a flashy sound echoed.\nElliot and Neil both gulped and looked at Bridget as if they were looking at something terrifying.\nIn the midst of all this, Bridget unfolded the fan she had swung down and told the girl in a chilling voice.\n\"Have you woken up?\"\n\"………\"\nThe girl paused for a few seconds, but then began to turn the pages as if nothing had happened.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n——Ouch.\nStill immersing in the world of numbers, Monica suddenly felt a strong pain in her cheek.\n——Painful things are scary. And scary things are always depressing.\nThe more painful or scary the situation was, the more Monica's thoughts sank into the world of numbers.\nBecause as long as she thought about numbers, she will not feel depressed.\nIn the beautiful world of numbers, nothing can hurt Monica. It will never say horrible things or do painful things to her.\nHence, Monica, who felt a pain in her cheek, immersed herself in the world of numbers again, as if to distract herself from reality.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThis is baaaaad, Monica's completely out of her mind!\nNero, the black cat who had been exploring the school building, watched this scene from outside the window of the student council room.\nHe saw everything, including the part where Monica gets smacked on the cheek with a fan.\nYou can't! Slapping her is counterproductive! If you scare Monica, she'll get more and more lost in the world of numbers!\nNero has learned how to bring Monica back to her senses in this state.\n——And that was using a paw.\nIf you give her a paw on her cheek, she will come back to her senses. For that reason, he wanted to get close to Monica somehow, but since the window was locked, he couldn't get inside.\nNero scratched the window and meowed.\nThe most petite boy was the first to notice Nero and shouted, \"Oh, there's a cat,\" and the other two turned to look at the window.\nGood, now my chance has come!\nNero sat down a little on the window sill then struck the cutest pose he could muster before squealed, \"Meow.\"\nHow's that? It's my special move! Sexy dynamite pose with all my might! Now all the little girls are going to fall in love with me!\nOnce he strikes this pose, most humans should have melted into Nero so they would let him in.\nIn addition, I would let you groom and feed me!\nor so what he thought triumphantly like a spoiled child, but the lady with the fan said flatly.\n\"I don't like creatures who do nothing but begging.\"\nMeow… meow… meowhat!?\nNero was furious.\nCan this be allowed to happen? No, it should not be allowed at all. Because I'm so cute!\nWho said I was only creatures who do nothing but begging, you little human girl! Let me show you how serious I am!\nEven though Nero making a ruckus while stomping on the ground, Monica still hasn't noticed Nero.\nJust, open, the window! Let me paw her cheeeeek!\nAs Nero was scratching the window roughly, two more people came into the reference room.\nIt was Monica's target for protection, the second prince, who was also the president of the student council. Following him was a silver-haired young man who was apparently his aide.\n\"Oh? what's going on?\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThe first thing Felix did when he entered the archive room was to check the keys.\nIt hasn't moved from its initial position…\nWith a natural demeanor, he checked the other cabinets, but they didn't seem to have been ransacked. The only thing that had been removed in its entirety was a cabinet for accounting records.\nFelix picked up one of the documents that lined up at his feet and flipped through the contents.\nThat was the accounting records from twenty-four years ago and there was a piece of paper with the correct numbers tucked in where the corrections were made. The same went for the other documents.\nCyril, who had been checking the documents beside Felix, peeled his eyes back in disbelief.\n\"This is… impossible! She's not only reviewed five years of records, but she'd done it for the entire records! Why did she even bring out all these old records! Hey, little girl! Explain the situation!\"\nDespite Cyril's ranting, Monica was not responding. His white cheeks were twitching in anger. At this rate, he might even hit Monica.\nIt was then that Felix noticed something. Monica's right cheek was swollen.\n\"What happened to her cheek?\"\n\"I have to teach the rude one a little discipline.\"\nBridget replied with a sullen look and covered her mouth with her unfolded fan.\nApparently, Monica's attitude had angered her.\nFelix stroked Monica's cheek with his gloved fingertips. As expected, Monica didn't even bat an eye.\n\"Just now, I've asked her to review five years' worth of accounting records.\"\nAfter explaining this to the members of the student council, Felix calculated the numbers on the page where the correction paper was tucked.\nIt was as Monica pointed out, there were some flaws.\nBut I can't believe she went through the trouble of reviewing all the past records.\nEven Felix was surprised by it… It has been a long time since he has been so surprised by something.\nFeeling a little impressed, Felix gently tapped Monica on the shoulder.\n\"Good work, Miss Norton. I think it's time for you to take a break.\"\nBut Monica did not reply.\n\"Miss Norton.\"\nWhen Felix shook Monica's shoulder a little harder, Monica lifted her right arm, and… brushed Felix's arm away in annoyance.\nThe student council members started to become agitated. Cyril, in particular, became enraged and began to spread his ice mana.\n\"You! How dare you disrespect His Highness! You deserve to die!\"\nCyril started chanting angrily, but Felix lifted one of his hands to stop him.\nThen he looked at Monica as if he were looking at a strange creature.\nMonica was now using all of her consciousness to do calculations. The girl who was so scared to look at Felix's face was now not even looking at him.\nIt was the same as when she praised his sequence number more than Felix's appearance.\nThat strangely tickled Felix's heart.\n——\nI would rather have you look back at me than at my numbers sequence.\nA faint smile appeared on Felix's lips, then put his fingers on top her cheek, then——\n——drop a single kiss on it where the red swollen cheek was.\nWhile the student council members were in a state of shock, Monica's movements stopped, but she kept her eyes on the documents.\n\"Wait a minute, Nero… I'm almost done…\"\n\"Nero?\"\nWhen Felix tilted his head and asked, Monica's thin shoulders jerked up and the quill fell from her hand.\nEventually, her whole body began to shake, and her head slowly, slowly turned toward Felix.\n\"Y-Y-Y-Y-Your…\"\n\"Hm. You did your job very well.\"\nIn response to Monica's strange voice, Felix gave her a smile, causing her to tumble out of her chair then fall on the floor.\n\"P-P-Please pa-pardon me fo-for my disrespectful mann—.\"\nApparently, she bit her tongue at the end.\nMonica clutched her mouth and began to squeal.\nFelix gently stroked Monica's head, feeling as if he was watching a toy that moved in a delightful way.\n\"Please raise your head. You've worked so hard to fulfill my request, so you have nothing to be blamed for.\"\n\"Ye-Yesh…\"\nMonica nodded while sniffling, but Cyril interjected with one hand raised, \"With all due respect.\"\n\"Your Highness, this little girl has gone too far. Your Highness, you were only ordered her to check the accounting records for the past five years… but she has gone all the way reviewed documents other than those ordered by you, so I think she should be punished.\"\nAt Cyril's statement, Monica turned pale again and began to shake pitifully.\nFelix didn't ask Cyril but asked Monica.\n\"What did you think when you saw those accounting records?\"\n\"Um… That's…\"\n\"I won't get angry at you. Just be honest and tell me what you think.\"\nWhen Felix urged her in a calm voice, Monica fidgeted with her fingers and said.\n\"I was surprised at how sloppy the management was, even though the amount of money moving around was incredibly large!\"\n\"You!\"\nCyril became enraged and yelled at her, while Monica cowered while saying, \"You said you wouldn't get angry…\"\nFelix looked around at the members of the student council with a faint smile.\n\"This is the reality of our previous student councils. All of the student council members were in a position where had no financial difficulties, which is why it has been poorly managed. Even I was unable to catch Aaron O'Brien's wrongdoing right away… So with that reminder, I hereby declare.\"\nFelix grabbed Monica's hand, who had shrunk back into a sobbing heap, then announced in a high-pitched voice.\n\"I hereby appoint Miss Monica Norton, a sophomore in high school, as Student Council Treasurer.\"\nIn the next moment, Monica's eyes turned white then collapsed on the spot.\nAs for the black cat, he was meowed noisily outside the window.",

      "content": "\"Hey, Monica. Wake up.\"\nShe heard Nero's voice along with the soft sensation of a paw pressing against her cheek.\nOpening her eyes, Monica realized that she was lying on a clean bed. Her bed was surrounded by curtains and smelled faintly of disinfectant. It was an infirmary.\nRolling over on the bed, she saw Nero, a black cat, sitting on the bedside table. Animals were strictly forbidden here, so he must have sneaked in through the window.\n\"Nero, I just had an amazing dream. In my dream, I was appointed as treasurer of the student council…\"\n\"Listen to me and be surprised, Monica. What you saw there was not a dream, but a reality.\"\nNero then poked Monica's collar with his paw.\nAn unfamiliar decorative pin was pinned to Monica's lapel. It was proof of membership in the student council, similar to what Felix and the other student council members wore on their lapels.\nMonica got up from the bed and stared at her collar.\n\"T-T-This is…\"\n\"His Highness put it on your lapel. People love that kind of thing, don't they? The thing so-called authority.\"\nNodding in approval, Nero then tapped Monica's thigh with a paw.\n\"At any rate, you did a good job. Now, as a student council member, you can proudly stand by the prince's side.\"\n\"I-Is that so?\"\nConsidering the fact that she had to protect the second prince in secret, her appointment as treasurer was a great blessing, but… Naturally, no one would like the idea of a dull girl like Monica being elected to the student council.\nAt that time, Monica was mostly crawling on the floor, so she didn't see the faces of all the student council members. Despite she was lying flat on the floor, she could still feel their cold hostility.\nEspecially the vice president, Cyril Ashley, who looked like he was about to use offensive magic.\n\"T-They would definitely harass me… like put thumbtacks in my shoes, hide my writing utensils, and pour water on my uniform… No, I really don't want to go to class anymore…\"\n\"Oh, I've read such situations in novels! But, are you sure they would go that far?\"\n\"Why do you look so happy?\"\nJust as Monica wailed in a sorrowful voice, Nero's ears perked up.\n\"Hey, someone's coming.\"\nWith that, Nero quickly hid under the bed.\nI wonder who that might be? Could it be the infirmary staff?\nAs Monica was thinking about this, the curtain surrounding the bed was drawn up.\nIt was not the infirmary staff, but Felix.\nMonica reflexively pulled the blanket over her head. She knew it was rude, but she couldn't help it because her body moved on its own. It's called defense instinct.\nFelix didn't look uncomfortable but rather smiled in amusement.\n\"Oh, you're awake? I'm sorry for coming without notice. I thought you were still asleep.\"\n\"Tha… Tha… Tha…\"\n\"Hm?\"\n\"I-I think that would be disrespectful of me.\"\nWhen Monica squeezed out the words with a dying look on her face, Felix only responded with \"Oh,' in a smile before sat down on Monica's bed and crossed his legs.\nMonica wanted to open up some distance between them, so she wrapped herself in the blanket and moved to the very edge of the bed, but… She lost her balance then fell off the bed.\n\"Kyaah!\"\nFortunately, since she was wrapped up in a blanket, she didn't get hurt, but it still hurt.\nAt the same time, when Nero, who was hiding under the bed, gave her a look as if to say, \"What are you doing?\", it felt hurt too.\nWrapped in the blanket, she wondered if she should just crawl under the bed, but then she heard a voice above her.\n\"Little squirrel, why are you wrapped up in your blanket so tightly? Are you getting ready for your winter hibernation now?\"\n\"Y-Yesh, b-because today is so c-cold.\"\nUnfortunately, the season has just changed from summer to autumn, making it a very pleasant time to spend outside.\nStill, Monica clutched the blanket and insisted desperately that she was wearing it because she was cold.\nThen Felix wrapped his hand to the blanket that had been wrapped around Monica's.\n\"Oh, you poor thing. Okay, then let me warm you up.\"\nMonica quickly let go of the covers and backstepped herself from Felix, but… Using an unfamiliar backstep caused her legs to tangle up before she rolled off to the floor.\nOnce again, her eyes met with Nero's under the bed.\nI want to cry.\nStill, she couldn't stay crawling on the floor forever, so Monica hiding behind the bed before got up sluggishly to look up at Felix.\n\"Um, Your Highness…\"\n\"You can call me student council president, Felix, or whatever you want. Because from today on, you're a student council member like me.\"\nFelix's words brought reality to Monica's mind.\nMonica touched a decorative pin from her lapel and shakily told Felix.\n\"T-The role of treasurer… is too much for me…\"\n\"Are you unhappy with my decision\"\nHis voice contained just a hint of chilliness, which made him seem much more intimidating.\nFeeling like she was about to burst into a thousand pieces, Monica shook her head, but Felix held out Monica's hand while smiling then said, \"Then, I take it as an acceptance.\"\nThen he turned Monica's palm up and placed something on it. It was a baked sweet filled with nuts.\n\"Here's your reward for today. You did well.\"\n\"I'm afraid that would not—hmph!\"\nFelix picked up one of the sweets and popped it into Monica's stuttering mouth.\nRemembering that she hadn't had lunch yet, Monica munched on the sweets in silence. The sweets were a little hard as many nuts there, but it was filled with honey, which was a new taste for her. It was the first time she had tasted such a delicious treat.\nMonica, who has a tendency to concentrate on her food once she starts eating, forgot that she was supposed to decline his offer to become treasurer, instead, now she was focused on savoring the sweets.\n\"Is it good?\"\nIn response to Felix's question, Monica nodded her head as she munched on sweets.\nFelix gave Monica more sweets to take in her hand and then quietly stood up.\n\"If you work hard, I'll reward you with more of these, little squirrel.\"\nFelix waved to Monica and left the infirmary after saying \"see her tomorrow.\"\nMonica, who was left behind, swallowed the sweets in her mouth and finally came to her senses.\n\"Ahhhh, I forgot to decline his offer to become treasurer, what should I do Neroooo?\"\n\"Saying that while clutching that candy won't convince me of anything.\"\nIn her sniffling, she tucked the sweets into her pocket.\nFelix might not let her off the hook.\nFor Felix, keeping Monica by his side to keep an eye on her was the thing he wishes for since she had witnessed him going out for the night.\nSpeaking of His Highness's secrets…\nMonica put her hand on her swollen cheek and looked at Nero with a serious face.\nMonica has discovered the second prince's incredible secret.\n\"Nero, listen to me. I've discovered a huge secret about His Highness.\"\n\"What is it? Is it about his weakness?\"\nNero's tail flicked from side to side as his eyes lit up, and Monica nodded her head with a serious expression.\n\"His Highness… has a paw.\"\n\"He's not.\"\n\"But just now, in the archive room, I felt a soft paw on my cheek, and when I turned around, His Highness was there…\"\nMonica insisted while stroking her cheek, but Nero told her in a more serious manner than ever.\n\"You better forget it, Monica. Listen to me. You have to forget about what happened back there, understood?\"\n\"Eh? Oh, okay.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAfter Felix returned to his room in the dormitory, a light blueish white lizard crawled out of the breast pocket of his uniform.\nAs soon as the lizard landed on the floor, its figure was enveloped in a light mist and transformed into a young man with a hair color similar to its scales. He has a good-looking face, but he's somewhat gloomy and listless. What he's wearing was a well-tailored samurai uniform. His light blue hair, a color not normally associated with humans, was combed all the way back.\nThe young man bowed reverently before took off Felix's jacket. Then, while putting his jacket on a hanger, he opened his mouth.\n\"Are you sure about that, Your Highness?\"\nNeedless to say, what this chamberlain would like to say… is the appointment of Monica Norton as treasurer.\nFelix sat down on the couch and shrugged his shoulders lightly.\n\"Thing is, she hadn't touched the key I had dropped on purpose in the archive room. There was no sign of the other cabinets being opened either… At this point, I can't think of any reason to fault her.\"\nAfter Monica passed out, he checked all the documents Monica had reviewed in the archive room, and all her remarks were accurate. She had done all of the records for seventy years in just half a day.\nHer calculation ability was perfectly fit for an accountant.\n\"Of course, I don't believe she's an ordinary person. I'm sure she had her reasons for approaching me.\"\nAt this point, there was no way to tell which group Monica Norton belonged to or what purpose she had for approaching him. But he was convinced that there was something about her.\nHe tilted his head slightly and looked up at the young man who was his chamberlain.\n\"Why I would make her our treasurer if I knew she wasn't a civilian, is that what you want to say?\"\n\"Yes, Your Highness. In the first place, you've been aware of the wrongdoings of former treasurer Aaron O'Brien from the beginning, haven't you?\"\nSince he can't punish him severely if he let him doing frauds once or twice, so he let him do that for a year… it was so to ensure that Aaron O'Brien would be expelled from the school.\n\"After went to such lengths to finally get Aaron O'Brien expelled from the school… why would you want her to replace him?\"\nHe did not immediately answer his attendant's question but reached for the chessboard that he had left out on the low table. He then picked up a white pawn from the board before playing it in his hand.\n\"This is just a game, Will.\"\n\"Game, is it?\"\n\"Yes. This is a game of how to tame a timid little squirrel and get her to confess her plot.\"\nHe kissed the pawn piece and placed it on the board.\n\"You've seen it, haven't you? She's not interested in me at all.\"\n\"Well…\"\nThe young attendant clammed up but didn't deny it.\nHe had witnessed all of them from Felix's breast pocket.\nMonica, who was looking at the documents so intently, was not paying attention to Felix at all.\nWhen he approached her in the infirmary, she turned pale before backed away then fell off the bed… She didn't do that out of embarrassment, but it was because she was really scared out of him.\n\"Wouldn't it be nice if an unfamiliar little squirrel would only be friendly to me?\"\n\"However, with the election of the next king just around the corner, I think it would be wise not to play around too much.\"\n\"Will Dean.\"\nFelix spoke his chamberlain's name—Will's true name.\nLooking at Will who straightened his body, Felix spoke in a playful voice.\n\"My life will last until the next king is decided. If that's the case, why don't you let me have a little fun with her…\"\nFelix lowered his eyebrows slightly, before showing him a faint smile.\nOnly Will can understand the true wishes of this young man.\n\"Still, Your Highness…\"\nBut Will shook his head gently then politely bowed.\n\"If that was your wish, then I would gladly comply.\"\nFelix nodded in satisfaction and moved the white queen to the edge of the board.\n\"That little squirrel is more perceptive than I thought. Looks like I'll have to put off my plan visiting Madame Cassandra's house for a while.\"\n\"I hope you could just stick with it and refrain from going out at night.\"\n\"Well, perhaps figuring out a way to tame the little squirrel would keep me from getting bored.\"\nChuckled at his thought, Felix then flicked the white pawn with his finger. And the way it fell off the board was similar to when Monica fell off the bed.",

      "content": "\"How can a disgrace to our family like you become student council?! Just confess yourself! How in the world did you manage to win His Highness over?!\"\nIsabelle Norton, the daughter of Count Kerbeck, shouted in a voice that echoed through the hallway, then she slammed her teacup on the floor.\nMonica gulped at the sound of shattering glass.\nIsabelle also lifted up a stuffed animal that was displayed on the bedside table, and swung it up, before she slammed it against the wall followed by a muffled sound.\n\"Well, what's with the defiant look in your eyes? You seem to have no idea what you're getting into. Then I'll teach your body to make you understand!\"\nIsabelle then slammed the stuffed animal against the wall with all her might. Then, she wiped the sweat from her forehead with a fresh face. Her current face was filled with a sense of accomplishment, like a craftsman who had just finished a job.\n\"So, how my villainous act was?\"\n\"Um…\"\nMonica was at a loss for a response but Agatha, Isabelle's maidservant who was cleaning up the broken teacups, nodded with a smile.\n\"You are impressive as always, Lady Isabelle! Your villainous daughter act was very brilliant!\"\n\"Right? Right? Especially the part of saying \"I'll teach your body to make you understand!\" from the latest book. It was really something!\"\n\"True! I've read it too! It's the scene where just as the count's daughter raises her fork to scratch the heroine's face, the prince comes to her rescue!\"\n\"Yes! That scene is absolutely wonderful!\"\nMonica, who could not keep up with Isabelle and her maidservant's excitement, sipped the tea that had been prepared for her, then said.\n\"I think… slamming your teacup on the floor… is a bit too much…\"\nWhen Monica glanced at her teacup, Isabelle puffed out her chest with pride.\n\"Don't worry, it had cracks in it, to begin with! This is why I always keep chipped tableware in stock!\"\n\"I-Is that so?\"\n\"Oh, make sure to smash it on the marble, not on the carpet, so that the sound that it makes would resonate better!\"\nAfter hearing Isabelle's meticulous explanation, Agatha was, \"As expected of Lady Isabelle! You really know how to give instruction!\" while clapping her hands with a big smile.\nAfter Monica told Isabelle that she had been appointed as treasurer of the student council, Isabelle was jumping in joy. Then she invited Monica to her room to have some tea with her.\nAs a wealthy student, Isabelle had her own room in the dormitory and brought three maids. Among the maids, Agatha was the most junior, who's apparently a reading buddy of Isabelle. She also happily cooperated with Isabelle's play of \"the role of villainous daughter.\"\nIs she okay with treating her lady as a villainous daughter?\nIsabel and Agatha seemed to be really enjoying themselves, and Monica was secretly having a hard time wrapping her head around it.\nAnyone who passed by this room would have mistakenly thought that Monica had been taken into Isabelle's room and was being abused. But wouldn't this ruin Isabelle's reputation?\nDespite Monica's concerns, Isabelle put the stuffed animal back in place and sat back in her chair with a truly elegant posture.\n\"Well then, Big Sister Monica, let me say it again. Congratulations on becoming the treasurer of the student council. To be elected as a student council member just a few days after entering the school… as expected, you were really special!\"\nIsabelle was squealing while putting her hand on her cheek, but Agatha looked out into the hallway and signaled her lady with her eyes as she brought her finger to her lips.\n\"My Lady, Shh. If you speak too loudly, people in the hallway will hear you.\"\n\"Oh, you're right. Now, this may be less appropriate but congratulation on your assignment, Big Sister Monica. I was just happy as you.\"\nMonica who was meddling with her cup, spoke, \"Thank you…\" in a faint voice.\nTipping her cup gracefully, Isabelle smiled graciously at Monica.\nThe gesture and the smile on her face made it hard to believe that she was the same person who had been swinging the stuffed animal around. It was the smile of a perfect young lady.\n\"Big Sister Monica, if you have any problems in school life, please let me know. On the outside… I might be a brilliant villainous daughter who would interfere with your life, but when there are no people, I will fully support you.\"\nMonica nodded vaguely, wondering inwardly what did she mean by providing support while interfering with her…\nHer response might have made her getting headaches, but what her classmate would do was more than that.\nIn fact, after being dragged away by Cyril, the student council vice president, Monica was skipping classes all day. On top of that, if her classmate knows that she's become a student council member… she can't imagine what they will do to her.\nAlthough she felt no cold, her body was shivering, so she sipped her black tea.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nOn the next day, from the moment Monica left her room, she was subjected to the stares of everyone around her in the dorm, on the way to school, and in the classroom. Apparently, people were aware of the fact that Monica had become a student council member recently.\nTheir gaze which until yesterday had been one of contempt for the bumpkin was now one of malice mixed with jealousy.\nAnd that was malice and hostility that prickled against her skin.\nSome whisper even had irritation and mockery mixed in.\nI wanna go home…\nJust thinking about that, it almost made her crying, but someone suddenly tapped her shoulder.\nSurprised, her whole body frozen then shaking heavily.\nShe's afraid to turn around. That must be their signal to summon her before dragging her out to the back of the school then pouring a bucket of water on her… and now, her braid was held out which almost made her cry.\n\"Hey, you're going to wear that hairstyle today?\"\nThe one staring at Monica with a discontent face was Lana Collette. Today, she had her hair neatly curled and hanging down from the sides. A flower motif hair ornament was pinned to the base of her hair.\nOn the other hand, Monica was so depressed about going to school this morning that she didn't have the heart to practice her new hairstyle at all.\nAt times like this, she tends to be more careless with her appearance, and her braids are more shabby than usual.\nSeeing Lana's eyebrows furrowed in displeasure, Monica quickly apologized.\n\"I-I'm sorry… I couldn't practice properly…\"\n\"Is that related to the fact that you were taken to the student council yesterday?\"\n\"……….\"\n\"I heard a rumor that you've become the student council. Is that true?\"\nInstead of wearing the badge that identified her as a student council member, she placed it inside her pocket.\nLana's lips dejectedly pouted as Monica unconsciously put her hands in her pockets.\n\"Oh, you don't even want to talk to me?\"\n\"I-It's not like that… I-I…\"\nLooking at Monica was mumbling while put her gaze away, Lana briefly spoke, \"Hand.\"\nWhy did she hide her hands?\nAs Monica alternated between her hand and Lana's, Lana grabbed Monica's arm absentmindedly and immediately rolled up her sleeve. Monica gulped.\nIs her hand got injured? Did they do something terrible to her hands?\nWhile thinking something dreadful things Lana could think of, she gazed at Monica's wrist, then she exhaled with some relief.\n\"Sigh, I thought your hand was injured or something…\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Vice president Ashley used ice magic on you yesterday, didn't he? The ice handcuffs that were made to restrain you. That's why I thought you might have frostbite…\"\nMonica was touched as her tears were welled up.\nYesterday, when Cyril put the ice handcuffs on her, Monica put up a defensive spell as soon as she could, so to not get frostbite. However, Lana, who didn't know this, was worried that Monica might have suffered from frostbite.\nIt was like one of the fears she had until now was melting in her mind. Without her notice, she was crying while making a laughing face.\n\"Thank… you…\"\nAlthough Lana gave her a snort, her cheeks were slightly red.\n\"Well, I guess I'll have to braid your hair again today.\"\n\"Heh-heh…\"\n\"Why are you giggling like that!? At least, you should learn to braid your hair yourself!\"\n\"Hm, okay…\"\nMonica nodded her head, feeling strangely happy.\n\"So you had your friend did your hair yesterday? What a nimble hands.\"\nThat soft voice was coming from a person that she had heard so much yesterday even she was pretty sick of it.\nLana was surprised to hear such voices. Not just Lana, everyone was also surprised looking at the person that came into their class.\nTurning around with a pale look on her face, Monica's eyes met Felix's, who was smiling at her.\nHis soft blond hair which was glistening in the morning sun, his mysterious blue eyes, and his neatly shaped face were making the girls screaming in shrill voices.\nThose who were calmer didn't raise their voices, but they still looked at Felix with a passionate gaze. Despite her surprise, Lana also admired Felix's appearance.\n\"Good morning.\"\n\"G-Good moourni—\"\n\"I'm sorry for barging in so suddenly this morning. I just wanted to give you the schedule for the student council members.\"\nThe surroundings stirred at Felix's words. Even Lana was staring at Monica with her eyes wide open.\nI really want to disappear from this place right away…\nFelix handed a piece of paper with a written schedule to Monica, who looked almost dying, before tracing her collar with his finger.\n\"Oh, where's your badge? You didn't wear it?\"\n\"W-Well…\"\nMonica tried to ignore him by turning her head to the side, but Felix grabbed her by the chin and forced her to face him.\n\"Take out your badge.\"\nAfter Monica took out her badge in fear, Felix snatched it up and pinned it to Monica's lapel with his own hand.\n\"You can't just take it off without permission, okay? Now you're a member of the prestigious student council, so you should keep up an appearance worthy of that.\"\nI don't want to be a student council member. But to accomplish this mission, I don't have a choice but to do it.\nMore than that, the gazes that gathered at her felt so prickling.\nS-Scary…\nAlso, the distance between them was so close. No, it's too close.\nThat's why, to escape from that reality, Monica started counting the number of Felix's eyelashes.\nOne, two, three, four…\nthen she thought,\nHis eyelashes got the same color as his hair, and surprisingly it was pretty long. How many matchsticks can be put on there? Two, no… perhaps three of them?\nAlong with counting the number of eyelashes, Monica also thought, to make it can support such matchsticks, she also had to consider the number of eyelashes needed to, the strength of each lash, the density of its growth. Not to mention, the angle of the lashes was also important.\nStill escaping from the reality as thinking all of this, Felix's long eyelashes lifted in front of her, following by his blue eyes twinkled playfully, he then looked up at Monica.\n\"What are you up to, staring at me like that?\"\n\"P-Puting… M-Matchstick…\"\n\"Matchstick?\"\n\"I was thinking about the best angle to put a matchstick on those eyelashes.\"\nHer classmates, including Lana, who had been watching with breathless anticipation were, \"Wha—, you idiot…\" in paled faces.\nBut Felix's shoulder quivering after struggling to hold his laughter, and then he removed his hand from Monica's collar.\n\"You should ask your friend to make your hair pretty. Your hair was quite lovely yesterday. The ribbons looked good on you too.\"\nFelix finger-combs a bit of Monica's hair and gives her a snappy wink.\n\"Well then, I'll see you after school. In the student council room.\"\nAfter that, Felix left the classroom.\nAs for Monica, she sat on her chair weakly then took a deep breath.\nShe was so tired. Morning just has started but she was already this tired.\nNow she just wanted to go back to her room and crawl into bed… As she was thinking this, Lana pushed Monica's shoulder and sat her down in a chair. Her eyes were blazing.\n\"U-Um…\"\nMonica nervously looked up at Lana, but the latter just snorted and held up her comb.\n\"Now my skills have been recognized by His Highness, I can't send you off with an inadequate hairstyle, can I? So prepare yourself. I will make sure to have your hair look very trendy, stylish, and cute.\"\n\"Please just make it like yesterday.\"",

      "content": "Sorry for the late post.\nAfter school, Monica who had reached the front of the student council room took a deep breath lifting her hand to knock… then stopped.\nFor a while now, Monica has been repeating the same motion repeatedly. This was the thirtieth time she had taken a deep breath.\nThe sight of her standing in front of the door of the student council room, taking deep breaths, was nothing but short of suspicious. Monica's mission was to eliminate the suspicious people near the second prince, but she was definitely the most suspicious person at the moment.\nT-This time for sure…\nThis time I will knock on the door for sure\n… or so determined Monica, but when she just about do that…\n\"Um… are you okay?\"\nHearing someone's voice from behind had made her jump in surprise, which made her head hurt after it slammed into the door.\nFeeling guilty toward Monica who was now holding her head timidly, he bowed in apology.\n\"Ah, sorry for calling you out of the blue. Well, you've been taking deep breaths in front of the door for a while now, so I thought you might not be feeling well…\"\nIt was a boy with light brown hair who approached Monica. He was rather small and looked young, but judging from the decoration on his sleeve, he was in the same grade as Monica. On his collar, he wore the same student council officer badge as Monica.\nHe's a student council member as well?\nNow that she thought about it, she felt she saw other people in the archive room as well. But, since at that time she was too engrossed in reviewing those documents, she had paid no attention to it.\nWhile Monica squirming, the boy gave her a polite bow.\n\"I presume you are our new treasurer, Monica Norton? I'm Neil Clay Maywood, the general affairs assistant. It's nice to meet you. Since we are the only second-year students on the student council, I hope we can get along.\"\nHis bashful smile that had displayed toward Monica was of that a good person.\nAnd Monica felt relieved to that.\nInwardly, she's been worrying what if other student council members hated her, now that she saw there's had good people like him among them, it made her feel relieved.\nI might able to get along with them\n… or so she thought while patting her chest in relief.\n\"How long are you want to talk in front of the door?\"\nHearing an angry voice echoed from her behind, her shoulder jerked.\nTurning her head around, she saw Cyril Asley, the student council vice president, staring at Monica with his arms folded.\n\"Monica Norton, because of your repeated weird behavior while standing in front of the door, I can't get in the room!\"\nApparently, Cyril had seen Monica repeatedly taking deep breaths in front of the door.\n\"Um, vice president… were you watching her the whole time by any chance?\"\nWhen Noel said that in a low voice, he immediately covered his mouth after being glared at by Cyril.\nCyril snorted haughtily glaring at Monica again.\n\"I don't care how did you make His Highness elected you as student council members, but I will never recognize you as one of us.\"\nAfter spoke that, Cyril opened the door to the student council room.\nHaving urged by Neil, Monica could only timidly followed them.\nIn the student council room, three people were already seated there. Seated at the office desk in the center was the student council president, Felix.\nAt a low table was a beautiful woman with light blond hair and a young man with reddish brown-colored hair with slanted eyes. They were checking some documents.\nNoticed at Monica who stood behind Cyril, he gave her a smile.\n\"Okay, I guess everyone's here.\"\nAfter Felix spoke those words, the rest members were naturally moved to the low table leaving the innermost seat and the last seat, empty.\nThe seat next to Neil was probably Monica's seat.\nFelix took a seat at the far end before urging for Monica to be seated.\n\"Now, as I mentioned yesterday, student council has decided to replace our previous treasurer, Treasurer O'Brien, with Miss Monica Norton as our new student council officer.\"\nListening to Felix's words with a solemn attitude were the vice president, Cyril, and a beautiful blonde woman. The reddish brown-haired young man was looking at Monica with a somewhat amused look in his eyes, while Neil was nervously looking at his seniors.\n\"I'll start by introducing myself. I'm Felix Ark Ridill, who served as the student council president.\"\nSince Felix has stood to introduce himself, everyone also obliged to introduce themselves.\nCyril, the vice president, opened his mouth with a bitter look on his face.\n\"…Cyril Asley, served as the student council vice president.\"\nMonica could feel his hostility towards her from his sharp voice.\nWhile Monica cowered, the reddish brown-haired young man leaning against the backrest lazily, then lifted one hand.\n\"I'm Elliott Howard, served as the secretary. Nice to meet you.\"\nElliot was a young man with slightly slanted eyes with a frivolous air about him.\nThe next person to speak to was a beautiful young lady with beautifully coiffed light blonde hair.\n\"I'm Bridgette Graham, served as the secretary.\"\nBridget gave her name nonchalantly without looking at Monica.\nAfter her quick self-introduction, she covered her mouth with a fan without another word.\nFinally, Neil who was sitting next to her shyly introduced himself to Monica,\n\"I'm Neil Clay Maywood, serving as general affair assistant… I have introduced myself earlier, haha.\"\nIn the still tense atmosphere, Neil's laughter echoed hollowly.\nTo soften that atmosphere, Felix opened his mouth.\n\"Well then, now is your turn to introduce yourself, Miss Monica Norton.\"\nOh, why did she has so many opportunities for hateful self-introduction these days? If she could, she would run away right now.\nIf I run here, Louis will scold me, Louis will scold me, Louis is scaring me, Louis is scaring me.\nSo Monica imagined Louis Miller as her fellow Seven Sages, in her mind.\n——Oh, my colleague? You can't even introduce yourself properly? Hahahaha, you sound like a dying cicada. Since when did cicada become my colleague? If you're so incompetent, people will think I, as your colleague as incompetent as you, will they? Now, if you understand, go straight up your spine, and turn yourself into a human being, you cicada girl!\nJust imagining It almost made her crying.\nSo Monica introduced herself with a faint voice while sniffling.\n\"I-I'm Monica Norton…\"\nShe said it, she actually said it.\nAlthough it bit stuttered, she did a good job introducing herself, or so she thought. But…\n\"How unsightly.\"\nThe one who cut off Monica's self-introduction with a single word was Bridget. She looked at Monica with her amber eyes before covering her mouth with a fan before she spoke coldly.\n\"I've never heard of a student council member who couldn't even say his or her name properly.\"\nAs Monica's shoulders jerked, Bridget gave her a cold glance before shifting her gaze to Felix.\n\"Your Highness. I don't believe this girl is qualified to stand in public. Please reconsider your decision before you bring the reputation of the student council down.\"\nFelix's smile was still as gentle as ever——he closed his eyes in amusement.\n\"You don't like my choice?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nWithout fear or flattery, Bridget plainly nodded to Felix, the second prince.\n\"Are there anyone else who thinks the same way?\"\nIt was Cyril who reacted to this.\nCyril stood from his chair, clenched his fists, then made a powerful speech.\n\"Your Highness! I am of the same opinion as secretary Graham! I hope you could reconsider your decision! If you bring this little girl here, it will only disgrace our student council!\"\nCyril insisted loudly, Elliot looked on in amusement, and Neil flustered.\nAnd Felix——for some reason, he was chuckling. But even though his mouth was smiling, his blue eyes were shining somewhat coldly.\n\"You guys are funny. You keep your mouth shut while act as if he never existed when injustice happened to former treasurer Aaron O'Brien, and now you loudly denounce Miss Norton for something she has yet to do.\"\nThe air in the room froze.\nCyril turned pale and said, \"That's…\" as he hesitated, and Brigitte sunk into silence expressionlessly.\nMonica did not know what kind of person the previous treasurer had been. However, from the flow of the conversation, she guessed that he had been forced out of the position of treasurer due to some kind of fraud. Remembering the inadequacy of the last year's accounting report, it was easy to imagine what he had done.\nFelix crossed his leg, smiling as beautifully as he could, and said.\n\"People without backing are easier to denounce, right? You don't have to worry about them attacking you back.\"\nThe student council members' expressions hardened at the gentle, soft, yet chilling words.\n\"If Miss Norton misbehaves in any way, it will be my fault for appointing her. At that time, I promise I will resign as student council president.\"\nThe student council members were horrified by this statement, but Monica was undoubtedly the one who was more surprised than anyone else.\nW-Wait, wait, waaaiiiiiiit!\nShe honestly has a feeling she's going to screw up. She will. She's going to screw something up. After all, except when it came to numbers, Monica was just a plain, ordinary girl.\nAs Monica clacked her teeth in a shudder, Felix clapped his hands lightly.\n\"Okay, we will end our talk here. So, without further ado, Cyril. Please teach Miss Norton how to handle accounting.\"\nAt Felix's instruction, Cyril opened his mouth with a look of extreme frustration on his face. But he swallowed his objections, bent his mouth into \"へ\" shape, and nodded grudgingly.\n\"As you wish…\"\nCyril raised his head as he glared at Monica. His eyes were blazing with hostility filled with murderous intent. He even made a gnashing noise.\nOf all people, why it has to be him who's going to teach her how to do her job!\nFrightened at that sight, Monica looked up at Felix.\n\"U-Um… I think… being taught by the vice president is…\"\n\"You know, Cyril's been acting treasurer for a while now after we got the previous treasurer to quit.\"\nStopping his words, he looked into Monica's face in amusement.\n\"Did you perhaps want me to teach you?\"\n\"N-No, I just hope… t-the person who would teach me… was someone with similar grade to me…\"\nIn other words, it was the most mild-mannered-looking boy, Neil.\n\"I see…\"\nFelix smiled kindly and said.\n\"Work hard with Cyril's lesson.\"\n\"Hiiek!\"",

      "content": "Cyril Ashley, the eldest son of Marquis Highon, was not originally from the Ashley family.\nSince the current Marquis Highon only had a daughter, Cyril, as the most talented of their distant relatives, was chosen as his adopted son.\nEven though they had a blood relation to the Marquis of Highon family, Cyril's family didn't have any peerage title, which placed them at the bottom rank. Even so, Cyril was so talented to be even chosen as their adoptive son.\nHaving status like that in his school had made him proud, thinking that he was an outstanding person or was a chosen one.\nBut Cyril, who was proud and delighted after became the adopted son of the Ashley family, met the Ashley family's daughter…\n…and it made him despair.\nThe daughter of Marquis Highon—Cyril's step sister—had outstanding intellect.\nThe House of Marquis Highon was said to be a family of \"intellectuals\". And his step sister was so intellectual that even made such Cyril can't even compare to her.\n———If that's the case, why did they adopt him?\nCyril, on the verge of losing the meaning of his own existence, desperately tried to learn about every possible field.\nHowever, the gap between her and his step-sister never seems to be closing. In fact, the more he learned, the more he realized the difference between himself and his step-sister.\nIt was at this time when he was at the very low, the second prince, Felix Ark Ridill reached out to him.\n\"Will you lend me your strength? Cyril Ashley.\"\nAt that time, Cyril said he didn't have that \"intellectuals\", but Felix only smiling before gave him a response.\n\"I didn't choose you because you're from the Ashley family. I chose you because you're you, Cyril.\"\nAt that moment, he made up his mind.\nFrom now on, he decided to devote all his life to this person.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"As treasurer, your job will become busy at the end of the month and the beginning of the month. I'll list all the things that must be done here, so make sure there are no omissions.\"\nCyril Ashley was blatantly aggressive towards Monica, but he still explained the job thoroughly.\nThe only thing that bothered her was that there was one large glass on the table. During his explanation, Cyril would briefly chant an incantation before dropping one or two ice cubes into the empty glass.\nHaving become curious about the situation, once the explanation was done, Monica spoke up timidly.\n\"U-Um, what are you going to do with that ice…\"\n\"Each time you make a mistake, one of these ice cubes would be shoved into your mouth.\"\n\"Hiieeeee!\"\nCyril nervously fiddled with the brooch on his collar with his fingers before he dropped another ice cubes into his glass.\nMonica suddenly realized. The cold air that had been scattered around him had subsided during the time Cyril was making the ice cubes.\nCould it be the reason he's making these ice cubes was for this…?\n\"If you have time to look around, look through the documents.\"\n\"I'm sorry…\"\nMonica hurriedly turned back her gaze to the documents, but to be honest, the current job she has was not that complicated.\nIn the first place, before coming to this school, Monica had been forced to work with all kinds of numbers, such as finances, cashier's records, product sales trends, demographics, and so on. Compared to that, the current accounting work was nothing.\nAfter finishing his explanation, Cyril spun his ice-filled glass around as he snorted in displeasure.\n\"I've been planning to shove this into your mouth, in case you have bad at memorizing things, but… apparently it was not necessary.\"\nIt seems those words meant as the \"passing grade\" from Cyril.\nAfter Patting her chest in relief, she was glared at by Cyril.\n\"Why are you acting so jumpy and timid?\"\n\"U-Um… E-Er…\"\n\"In fact, I don't like that servility attitude of yours.\"\nThat's something Monica used to be told.\n——Why are you being so servile?\n——You should be proud of your talent.\n——If you despise yourself, what about those who are not even close to your talent?\n\"You've been chosen by His Highness. And your talent also has been acknowledged by him. So, why don't you show any pride in it?\"\nDon't be so servility. Don't despise yourself. Have confidence in yourself. You have a talent.\nHow many times has she been told that when she mastered the no-chanting spell?\nEven with that said, Monica couldn't refuse them.\nIt's not that she denied her pride. Having pride in something you good at is a good thing. Believing in your talent is also a wonderful thing. If it were possible, Monica would want to be like that.\n…but she can't do any of those things.\n\"I-I'm sorry… I just can't… feel to be proud of myself…\"\nMonica said in muttering while she shook her head.\n\"It just… impossible…\"\nIn the past, when she was attending Minerva, Monica had only one boy she could call a friend.\nHe took care of her because she was shy. Since she couldn't speak well in front of others, he accompanied her to practice her chanting. And it had made Monica happy.\nBut when Monica mastered no chanting spell and became known as a genius, their friendship began to deviate.\n\"I bet you've been looking down on me all along, haven't you?\"\nNo, you got it wrong, was what she wanted to say, but those words didn't reach him.\nAnd without being able to reconcile with him, Monica graduated from Minerva and became one of the Seven Sages.\nIt's a bitter memory that still lingers in Monica's mind, even now.\nMonica hung her head down, but Cyril's thin eyebrows furrowed as he bent his lips into \"へ\" shape.\n\"The word that I hate the most was ‘impossible'.\"\n\"I'm sorry…\"\nIn response to Cyril's denunciation, Monica could only look down and apologize.\nHe recalled when his father told him. He said talent can sometimes be a curse.\nFor Monica, talent was a curse. It always took away the things that Monica wanted.\n——Her father, her friends.\n\"Hello, are you progressing well?\"\nThe cheerful voice brought Monica back to her senses. When she turned her gaze, Felix was peering at her desk.\nCyril straightened his back and answered promptly.\n\"I've explained all of our regular duties and the work to be done at the beginning and end of the month. It just leaves to the things related to events.\"\n\"Oh, there will be a chess tournament and a school festival before the winter break. You'll have to tell her about those, too.\"\n\"I will.\"\nAs Cyril nodded, Felix looked at the glass on the desk and lifted it lightly. The ice collided with each other, making a rattling sound.\n\"Are you not feeling well, Cyril?\"\n\"No, I'm fine. Your Highness.\"\n\"Well, that's good, but… take it easy, okay?\"\nWhat did that conversation mean, she wondered.\nDoes Lord Ashley feel ill when he makes ice?\nThe cold air that was being released on a regular basis, the ice that was purposely created in the glass, the brooch that was being touched nervously… To tell the truth, Monica had only one idea of what was going on.\nIs he perhaps…\nAs Monica was staring at Cyril's brooch, a finger reached out from the side poked Monica in the cheek.\nIf you look from the side, you will see Felix happily poked Monica's soft cheek.\n\"Don't just look at Cyril, look at me too.\"\n\"I-I'm sorryyyyy…\"\n\"You! How dare you show such disrespect to His Highness!\"\n\"I-I-I-I… I'm sorryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy…\"\nWhen Monica apologized, Cyril smacked the desk with his palms.\n\"Can't you speak clearly!?\"\n\"I-I-I'm so-sorry…\"\n\"Who said you could speak in stuttering?!\"\n\"Cyril, don't bully her too much, okay?\"\nFelix calmly restrained Cyril from shouting at her, but he said in a stern voice.\n\"I'm not bullying her, Your Highness! I'm disciplining her!\"\n\"I thought disciplining was the owner's job. If so, it's my job.\"\nShe felt that her human rights were being taken away without a second thought.\nFor now, Monica decided to immerse herself in the task of counting Felix's eyelashes in order to escape from reality.",

      "content": "Sorry for the late post. Lately, I've been busy with my work and didn't have enough time to translate. So I can only post one chapter in two or three days for the time being.\nCompleting student council tasks was not hard, but it had depleted her mental energy.\nAfter eating and bathing, Monica went back to the girls' dormitory attic and collapsed on her bed.\n\"Welcome back, Monica! You've been working hard!\"\nNero climbed on top of Monica, who was lying facedown, then he pounced on her shoulder with his paw. The massage was a little weak, but it was still felt pleasant.\nMonica closed her eyes enraptured, breathing in comfy.\n\"Today, I've been lectured… by Lord Ashley…\"\n\"Oh, was that the chilly guy who always shouting at you? So, how hard did he lectured you? Is he tougher than Loowee Rumpappa?\"\n\"Maybe… compared to Louis, he's a hundred times better…\"\n\"Well, your colleague's indeed a devil.\"\nCyril Ashley's hard attitude towards Monica has been drained her, to say the least, but his instruction was generous. He would list the things she needed to know, and if she had questions about something, he would tell her. Cyril, who has deeply admired Felix, was the kind of person who would take care of Monica as long as Felix ordered him to.\nIn comparison, Monica's colleague Louis Miller of the Seven Sages would slap her mercilessly whenever she stuttered, and would occasionally unleash a large attack spell. So as for Cyril who declared that he would throw ice into her mouth, it was looked somewhat kinder.\nRemembering the nightmare days when Louis had lectured her, making her only want to slump down on her bed, but a knocking sound coming in.\n\"…From the window?\"\nLifting her head, she saw a small bird pecked on the attic window. It was a beautiful bird with yellow-green feathers. Had the bird been kept by a nobleman escaped?\nThe little bird pecked on the window again. And when Nero, the black cat, approached the window., it didn't seem to be frightened\nThinking in wonder, Monica then opened the window, so the little bird flew in, circled the room before finally landed on the floor.\nIts form was enveloped in fine particles of light, and in the next moment, it transformed into a human form.\nStanding there was a slender, tall maid. She had a beautiful face, somewhat doll-like, which she had seen several times before.\n\"You are… Louis's maid…\"\nTo the muttering Monica, the maid plucked at the hem of her skirt, bowed, and introduced herself curtly.\n\"I am a contracted high spirit of Louis Miller the [Barrier Magician], Lindbergfield. Please, call me Lynn.\"\nRealizing she has been spouting rumors of Louis being the devil, Monica unconsciously straightened her back.\nThe fact that Louis's contracted spirit, Lynn, had visited Monica, probably meant that he wanted her to report on the progress of her mission.\n\"U-Um, you're here for the reports… right?\"\n\"That's one thing, but first… I've got an urgent message from Master Louis.\"\nUrgent—in that case, it's an important message that needs to be delivered as soon as possible.\nMonica and Nero gulped, wondering what kind of message it was.\nLynn opened her mouth impassively.\n\"[I, Louis Miller, from this now on I have…]\"\n\"I have?\"\n\"[become a dad.]\"\n\"We don't need that!! We don't need that kind of information!! Is it not different from a private message!?\"\nDespite Nero's yelling, Lynn didn't seem particularly upset but just nodded her head.\n\"Yes, ever since his wife's pregnancy, Mister Louis has become a shappy man.\"\n\"S-Shappy man?\"\nWhen Monica recited a word that was not familiar to her, Lynn was only said, \"shappy\" then nodded in a mysterious manner.\n\"The word ‘shappy' is said to be unique to the western part of the kingdom which stands for ‘extremely happy'. Therefore, it is a word used for people who are overly joyous.\"\n\"I-I see…\"\n\"Ever since I saw this word in a book, I have wanted to say it at least once. I am very excited to be able to use it now!\"\nAlthough Lynn said she was very excited, her expression was as blank as ever.\nIt's hard to tell how earnest this spirit was.\n\"Um… please give… Louis and his wife… my congrats…\"\n\"You gotta be angry right there! Monica! That devil magician has put you on a very troublesome mission, and now he's getting happy by himself! You should be angrier!\"\nNero raised his paw to insist on her, but Monica honestly just wanted to give them her congrats. Leaving aside Louis, she's been indebted to Louis' wife, Rosalie, a lot.\nLynn was \"I will pass your message to them.\" while nodding, then took a sheet of paper from her pocket.\n\"Alright, since the main subject has been conveyed…\"\n\"That was the main subject!?\"\nIgnoring Nero's retort, Lynn spread the paper she had taken out on the desk.\nLouis's handwriting was scribbled on the paper.\n\"I have been made aware of how incompetent you are with your oral reports. So be sure to write down all important reports on this paper and give it to Lynn.\"\nAs expected of her colleague. He fully understood that Monica would not be able to convey half of the important information if she gives her reports verbally.\n\"I have been assigned to be the carrier pigeon for this mission. If you have any reports or messages for Lord Louis, please fill them out and leave them with me. I will send it to him right away.\"\n\"Um, what if there's nothing in particular to report?\"\n\"I'll be staying here in the attic.\"\n\"I-I will write the report right away!\"\nMonica hurriedly moved the lamp to the desk and sat down in the chair.\nFortunately, she has something to report. Being appointed as a student council member was a big step forward in guard duty. This was something that she could proudly report.\nAnd the other thing is… as she was thinking about what to report to, Nero twitched his whiskers before looking out the window.\n\"Hey, the backside of the boys' dormitory is kind of chilly.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nMonica who's puzzled by Nero's words, interrupted by Lynn.\n\"There is an ice mana reaction behind the boys' dormitory. I'm not sure if he's using it intentionally or not, but I think his mana is leaking out of control.\"\nAn unpleasant premonition sent a chill down Monica's spine.\nThe first person who came to her mind when she mentioned ice mana was Cyril Ashley.\n\"Um, Lynn, are you sure the ice mana reaction is outside and not inside the boys' dormitory?\"\n\"Yes, it is outside. He's outside moving slowly towards the dormitory grounds.\"\nAssuming this magical reaction was from Cyril, would the earnest man sneak out of the dormitory at this hour?\nBut whatever the case, as the second prince's bodyguard, she couldn't overlook the unusual situation near the boys' dormitory.\n\"I-I will go check on the situation.\"\n\"But hey, Monica. How are you gonna get out of the girls' dormitory? You can't use flight magic, can you?\"\n\"Ah.\"\nNero was right.\nFlying magic requires a good sense of balance, something that Monica, with her catastrophically poor motor skills, has never been very good at.\nSkilled users can fly freely, but for Monica, the best she can do was jump a little higher, such as when she climbed over the fence in the old garden.\n\"Ugh… What should I do?\"\nMonica opened the window to look down at the ground.\nMonica's room was in the attic of a four-story building, which meant it was naturally very high.\nPerhaps she could jump from here and soften the impact with wind magic before landing on the ground. But scary things are scary.\nWhile Monica shivering when looking down from the window, Lynn tapped Monica on the shoulder.\n\"If that's the case, leave it to me. Since I am a wind spirit, I specialize in flight magic.\"\nHow dependable!\nMonica looked up at Lynn with respect, and Lynn put her foot on the window sill before saying.\n\"Please remember, my master said ‘landing on high-speed movement was very hard.' So, please prepare yourself at the time we're landing.\"\n\"Please move slowly theeeeen!\"\nMonica screamed, holding Nero to her chest.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"Your Highness…\"\nIn Felix's room in the boys' dormitory, his servant, Will, approached him in a bewildered manner.\nFelix, who was sitting on the couch drinking tea, put the cup back in the saucer and looked at Will.\n\"Is it about Cyril?\"\n\"Yes, I sense a strong ice mana outside the dormitory.\"\n\"Can you locate the exact location?\"\n\"I apologize. I can only give you an approximate direction.\"\nWill lowered his eyebrows apologetically. But there was nothing he could do about it. He was only good at optical tricks and illusions, and his sensing ability was not that great.\n\"Now, what to do? We can't just leave him alone, after all. Let's go check on him a bit.\"",

      "content": "Ever since he had been adopted to the House of Marquis Highon and shown the difference between his and his step-sister, Cyril started his study to learn magic to obtain his own strength.\nAfter all, having a strong foundation in magic would give him some advantage in aristocratic society.\nHe did have a talent for magic which his step-sister didn't. Born with higher mana than most people, he began to study hard—But, because of it, a disease was developing within him.\n——Mana Overdose Syndrom.\nHumans can only store mana in their vessel, but it can't generate mana from it. Instead, it can be recovered by absorbing small amounts of mana outside their body.\nThus, a human body can't store more mana exceeded of their vessel. Once the vessel is full, their bodies will reject and would not absorb any more mana.\nAnd the state when the vessel is full, but the body still judges that there is a lack of mana and continues to absorb mana on its own—that is mana overdose.\nIt may be similar to overeating. Just as the satiety center does not function properly, causing the body to seek food, Cyril's body didn't recognize his vessel was full and still absorbing more mana. And the excess mana which ate away his body was the cause of mana overdose. Therefore, he needed to regularly release the excess mana that could not be contained in his vessel out of his body.\nAccording to his doctor, the symptoms were caused by repeated reckless training.\nWhen he had developed this disease, Cyril fell into despair. He was sure that he would be abandoned by the Marquis family.\nHowever, Marquis Highon has prepared a magic tool for Cyril which can absorb and release his excess mana. That was the brooch he always wore on his lapel. The excess mana in his body will be absorbed and discharged from his body by wearing it.\nAs long as he wore that brooch, he should have no trouble carrying on with his daily life.\nThen, why this is happening…\nWandering through the forest behind the dormitory, Cyril chanted a short incantation.\nFreezing the tree before him, and turning it into an ice statue. With the use of spells, the amount of mana in his body will be reduced, giving him temporary relief. However, once again, Cyril's body quickly absorbed more mana.\nHis recovery speed was clearly faster than usual. Way too fast, actually. No matter how many spells he used, the mana in his body did not empty out. In fact, it's only increasing.\nThe excess mana that overflows from the vessel would eat away the human body, followed by their head throbbed with pain. and nauseous feeling.\nKneeling down, Cyril grasped the brooch on his lapel as he crouched down.\nA custom-made brooch that Marquis Highon—his adoptive father—had prepared for him.\nWith this item, he should be able to absorb your mana.\nWith this item, he should be able to control your overdose.\nWith this item… he should be able to meet Marquis Highon's expectations.\nI have to live up to his expectations!\nCyril had been living a life that could hardly be called aristocratic, but he wanted to live up to the expectations of his adoptive father, who had accepted him into the Marquis family.\nHe also wanted to live up to the expectations of the second prince, who had needed him and had chosen him as vice president.\nAnd more than that…\n——He wanted to live up to their expectation.\nThat was why Cyril should not be crawling on the ground here.\nBut contrary to his intention, his body absorbed more mana on its own. Cyril chanted a quick incantation and unleashed his ice spell.\nSo after freezing the rock in front of him, it should have eased his symptom… or so he thought, but his body kept absorbing mana.\nAlthough his mana absorption often went haywire when he was sick, this rate was still abnormal.\nWhy! Why! Why did this happen!?\nHe had to chant quickly and use the next spell, but his pulse was erratic and his breathing was deranged. In this situation, he couldn't chant and use a spell.\n\"Haa… Haa….\"\nCyril scratched the ground and convulsed, breaking out in a cold sweat.\nHis eyes went black and his consciousness became distant, and that's when…\nHe heard the cat's cry.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nWith Lynn's wind magic (which was moved slowly at Monica's insistence), the group of Monica, Nero, and Lynn, who had escaped from their dormitory room, following the traces of mana into the forest before reached the shadows of the trees where Cyril was.\nHe was writhing in agony, firing off a barrage of ice magic. Clearly, he was not in a normal state.\n\"His condition looks strange for training magic in secret.\"\nMonica nodded at Lynn's words.\n\"I think… Lord Ashley is having mana poisoning.\"\n\"Mana poisoning?\" spoke Lynn and Nero in sync. Apparently, neither of them knew anything about such a disease.\n\"C-Compared to spirits and dragons, the human body is less resistant to mana, so their body will worsen if they take too much mana in… And that state is called mana poisoning… In the worst case, it would lead them to death.\"\nMonica had seen a few people with the same symptoms when she was still enrolled at Minerva.\n\"Lord Ashley probably…has a constitution that absorbs mana easily. These people usually use magic frequently to reduce their mana or wear magic tools that absorb excess mana…\"\nThis was probably why Cyril constantly converted his mana into the cold air or made some ice block in his glass. That's how he was releasing the excess mana in his body.\nHe was so concerned about the brooch on his lapel that it was probably a magic tool for absorbing that mana.\nAfter hearing Monica's explanation, Lynn form a circle with her index finger and thumb and looked at Cyril through her finger.\n\"I have confirmed his mana flow. The brooch on his lapel seems to be collecting mana that was released outside his body and returning it to his body.\"\n\"I knew it! That magic tool is malfunctioning!\"\nThat magic tool has functioning contrary to its intended. That brooch needs to be removed as soon as possible.\nHowever, if Monica approached, Cyril would ask why Monica was here.\nAlthough Monica was going out wearing a hooded cloak, if she gets close enough to touch the brooch, he will notice her presence.\nAs Monica hesitated, Nero meowed bravely.\n\"Guess, I'll take care of it for you!\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nNero jumped out of the shadows of the tree and pounced on Cyril, caught the brooch on his collar with his mouth.\n\"A cat…?! Stop it… don't touch that…!\"\nCyril flailed his arms to resist, but Nero easily dodged him to remove the brooch. Which he then distanced himself from Cyril afterward.\n\"Give it back… Give it baaaack!\"\nShouting hysterically in bloodshot eyes, Cyril chanted a quick incantation.\nThe path that Nero's heading toward was instantly blocked by a wall of ice.\nUgh!\nNero hurriedly changed his path and tried to escape into the forest… but the wall of ice spread vigorously to block Nero's escape path.\nWithout realizing it, Nero and Cyril were surrounded by a wall of ice.\nThis is bad… And I'm not very good with coooold.\nThe chilling air flowing around his feet made Nero shrink back.\nEven so, he kept the brooch in his mouth and wouldn't let it go.\n\"Give it back… Give it back to me…\"\nCyril approached Nero with bloodshot eyes.\nIn between his ragged breathing, he heard Cyril spoke in a low voice.\n\"That brooch… was a present … from my father-in-law… to get his acknowledgment… I have…\"\nCyril's eyes that clouded with obsession have lost his reasoning.\nLooking at his figure, Nero couldn't help but felt pity for him.\nWhy are all humans so stupid?\nPerhaps he has his own reasons for being obsessed with this brooch. But it had nothing to do with Nero.\nCyril chanted a quick incantation. More than a dozen ice arrows float up around him.\nEach of them was as thick as my arm and they were more like stakes than arrows. Whatever it was, a direct hit would not end well.\n\"I've been… acknowledged by …… my father-in-law and… his highness… even so, why would…\"\nCyril's feverish eyes looked hollowly at Nero.\nEven then, what appeared in his eyes was not Nero.\nWhile his whole body was being consumed by mana, wallowing in fever, what he saw was visions of someone Nero didn't know.\n\"Why…\"\nHis neatly shaped face twisted into a pained and somewhat tearful expression.\n\"Why… Why would you not acknowledge me… Mother?\"\nAt that moment, the ice wall collapsed without a sound.\nThe ice wall and arrows that floated around Cyril were burning engulfed in flames.\nThe ice that Cyril had created melted and disappeared in less than a few seconds, and the flames that had melted the ice gathered in one place as if they had a will of their own, eventually becoming a flame serpent.\nAnd standing on the other side of the crumbling ice wall was a petite witch with her hood pulled up tightly over her eyes.\nAnd she was one of Seven Sages, a user of no-chant magic.\nMonica Everett the Silent Witch.",

      "content": "Although Cyril's father had the blood of the Marquis Highon family flowing in his veins, he had no title and was never wealthy.\nEven so, his father was so proud of it to the point of not getting work and acting arrogantly towards his mother.\nCyril didn't like that attitude, so he always took his mother's side. In his own way, he tried to make his mother happy.\nBut, every time his mother saw his face—the face that reminded her of his aristocratic father's face—she always made a sad face.\nEventually, by the time his father died drowned in alcohol, a member of the Marquis Highon family came to his house to make an offer to adopt Cyril.\nCyril was overjoyed when he heard that news.\nIt will ease my mother's life for sure! And I will make my mother happy!\nBut his mother, who saw Cyril's happy face, only let out a sigh before saying,\n\"Ah, you really are from a noble family. A son of a noble family.\"\n——No, I'm not, Mother. I am your son.\nJust that one sentence was the thing he couldn't say to his mother.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nIn front of Cyril's eyes was a figure with a hood pulled tightly over her eyes. That person had a small figure and did not look like an adult.\nBut as soon as the figure lightly lifted her right hand, the serpent that had melted Cyril's ice wall circled around by the hooded figure.\nAnd he sure that the person in the hood was a magician—the one who melted his ice.\nThe black cat that took Cyril's brooch meowed and ran up to the hooded figure. The hooded figure lifted up the black cat and picked up the brooch in the cat's mouth.\n\"…so that cat… was your cat…?\"\nDespite Cyril's low growl, the hooded figure paid no attention to him, instead, she only looked at the brooch.\nThis attitude irritated Cyril even more.\n\"Give that brooch back!\"\nIn a rage, Cyril chanted a spell to create an ice chain.\nCyril snapped his fingers, and the hooded figure's limbs were entangled in ice chains—but in the next moment, the ice chains were dissolved.\n\"…what?\"\nThe hooded figure hadn't done anything. He did not even saw that figure chanting.\nAnd yet, the ice chain shattered without a trace, scattering to the ground.\nDid I perform the wrong spell?\nCyril recited the spell again. But the result was the same. The ice chain disintegrated as soon as it manifested.\n\"How, how… Have you done something to me!?\"\nThe hooded figure continued to stare at the brooch without saying a word. As if Cyril was not even in sight.\n…And that kind of attitude felt so bizarre.\n\"Answer me!\"\nCyril created an ice arrow and shot it at the hooded figure. However, just before his arrows reached the hooded figure, it was engulfed in flames and melted, disappearing.\nCould it be, Cyril thought, she had allies around? Otherwise, it was inexplicable. The person in the hood was not even chanting. There was no way for a person could possibly neutralize Cyril's spell without chanting.\n\"Damn you… damn you…\"\nCyril made a large number of ice arrows and shot them out in all directions in a random. If there were any of this hooded figure's allies around, he wanted them to reveal themself.\nHowever, the hooded figure just glanced up slightly, and with that, his ice arrows were engulfed in flames and disappeared without a trace.\nWhat was that… what the hell was that…\nBlocking arrows fired in a random with a shield was not that difficult.\nBut to be able to counteract every arrow that was shot in random… that's the feat beyond human.\nWhat Cyril saw in front of him now was that kind of spell.\nMoreover, the flames that melted the ice disappeared without spreading to the surrounding trees. In other words, she had used such spells with that kind of precision.\nEach flame was woven together with frighteningly precise calculations. She cast that many spells in less than a few seconds?\nWhat is this, what's going on? What am I looking at?\nFor anyone who was not familiar with magic, they would have been taken aback by the flamboyant-looking flaming serpent.\nBut for someone who has dabbled in magic for even a short time, they would have noticed the small flame that struck down the ice arrow was unusual.\nThe fundamental defense in magical warfare is the shield—in other words, the protective barrier.\nHowever, the person in front of him intercepted his arrows without using a shield, showing Cyril the overwhelming difference in skill.\n\"What are you… what the hell are youuuu!!!\"\nCyril relinquished his fine control and converted all the mana he had into the cold wind, which he blasted at the hooded figure.\n\"Freeze! Freeze! I will freeze you into a mute ice statue!\"\nThe cold wind that he let out while screaming hysterically froze everything around Cyril. The ground, the trees, and even Cyril himself.\nIt didn't matter if his limbs were frostbitten or not, Cyril continued to blow cold wind at her.\nBut then he realized.\nHis full power cold wind was slowly being pushed back—or rather, deflected. Up to the sky.\nThe hooded figure was using a wind spell to deflect Cyril's cold wind.\nAt the same time, the ice that had been stuck to Cyril's limbs gradually peeled off—followed by a barrier that had been placed over Cyril's body to protect him from the cold wind.\nOf course, Cyril didn't cast a barrier, as he was using his spell without regard for his own safety.\nDid this person…\nThe hooded figure cast a wind spell to deflect the cold wind while protecting Cyril's body with a defensive barrier, which means… the hooded figure has been using those advanced spells simultanesly.\nThe hooded figure's allies must be the ones who used the technique secretly, hiding in the surroundings. That must be it.\nBut, what if that's not the case?\nIf this hooded figure alone was capable of using those many spells… then that would make that hooded figure a monster.\nCyril went pale and his whole body shuddered.\nThe excitement and intoxication that he felt when he was exercising his spell subsided, and the blood drained from his entire body.\n\"Ah…\"\nEverything in front of his eyes became hazy as strength drained from his body. He had run out of mana.\nJust before he lost consciousness, Cyril saw… that hooded figure ran up to him in a clumsy manner before extending her small hand.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"A-Are you okay?\"\nMonica rushed over to Cyril with a clumsy running style before putting his head in her lap to make sure he was okay.\nCyril was unconscious. His pulse was weakening a little, but it didn't seem to be life-threatening. He should be able to recover after a short rest.\n\"Thank goodness…\"\nThe early symptoms of mana poisoning are feeling a strong excitement to use spells, that's what she knew.\nIf it gets worse, symptoms such as hallucinations, heart palpitations, and dizziness will occur, and finally, the whole body will be eroded by mana, leading to death.\nTherefore, the quickest way to treat people who suffer from mana poisoning in the early stages is to let them use their mana until it's empty.\n\"Well done.\"\nLynn, who had been watching in the shadows, came into view and saw the brooch in Monica's hand.\n\"Did you find something wrong with that magic tool?\"\n\"Yes… the formulas that were built into it had deteriorated over time… in fact, to prevent deterioration, these formulas are usually covered with layers of protective formulas…\"\n\"Are you saying there was no protective formula on it?\"\nWhen Monica nodded at Lynn's words, Nero said, \"Isn't defective product then!\" wagging his tail in annoyance.\n\"Good grief, who the hell did that lousy job?\"\n\"Well… their name should be inscribed on the back of the brooch.\"\nTurning the brooch over, Monica's cheeks tensed when she saw the name engraved on it.\n\"…Emanuel Darwin the [Jewel Magician]…\"\n\"What? You know this guy?\"\nMonica was at a loss for a response, but Lynn replied matter-of-factly.\n\"Like Miss Monica, I believe he is one of the Seven Sages. He does not get along with Louis. He is a member of the Second Prince. A money-grubbing baboon geezer, according to Sir Louis.\"\nNero was silent for a few seconds before he opened his mouth.\n\"Is there no decent people among the Seven Sages?\"\nIt was a painful statement to hear.\nHearing that sentence, Monica who still overwriting the brooch with a new magic formula, clutched her chest in pain.\nMagic that adds mana to this kind of material was called ancillary magic.\nMonica was not a specialist in ancillary magic, but this brooch was not so complicated to make her difficult modifying it.\nFor example, the amulet that Louis made for Felix. It was a very advanced magic tool to sense danger and set up a protective barrier, but this brooch only has a function to absorb and release mana.\nThe amount of mana absorbed can be adjusted according to the amount of mana remaining in his body, might I put on it an auto-adjustment formula?\nMonica has a bad habit of wanting to apply any kinds of magic formulas when she sees it.\nBut, it would confuse Cyril if the function of the brooch suddenly changed.\nMonica then fixed the problem with the magic formula, incorporating only the auto-adjustment formula, followed by a double application of the protection formula to protect the formula.\nThis should keep it from breaking down too easily.\nAs Monica reattached the brooch to Cyril's collar, Nero looked up at Monica as if to mock her.\n\"Do you really need to go that far? I think you can get at least five gold coins just to repair a magic tool.\"\n\"Well…\"\nMonica trailed off, trying to collect her words, then stopped.\nMonica was just a little bit jealous of Cyril.\nThe fact that he can be proud of being acknowledged by someone else. And how he was willing to work hard for it.\n\"…mana-absorbing constitution is often inconvenient, but if you get used to it, it can give you an advantage as a magician.\"\nThe faster the mana you can absorb, the faster the mana you can recover.\nThe faster you recover, the more advantage you will have over other magicians in the long run.\nAs a matter of fact, some magicians were willing to go to extreme lengths to increase the speed at which they absorb mana, and push themselves to achieve this constitution.\nAnd such constitution of Cyril's could be called a \"talent\".\n\"…I don't want… he thinks of this talent as a curse…\"\nFor Monica who can't seem to be proud of her talent, she could only think this was a curse.\nFor that reason, she didn't want Cyril to become like her.\nShe wanted him to be confident and proud of himself.\n——and for Monica who can't be proud of herself.\n\"By the way… what are you going to do with him? Do you want to leave him here?\"\nNero squeezed Cyril's cheek with his paw.\nCertainly, it's not winter yet, but it was still uncomfortable to leave a sick person lying in the woods like this.\nAs Monica pondered what to do, Lynn gave her suggestion.\n\"Shall I blow this human body away with a gust of wind and throw it into the boys' dormitory?\"\n\"I-If possible, please do it more peacefully…\"\n\"Then, let me create a tornado to blow him into the boys' dormitory…\"\n\"It's just getting woooorse…\"\nHowever, even Lynn have sneaked into the boys' dormitory with her flying spell, she couldn't bring him to his room because she didn't know where Cyril's room was.\nAs Monica pondered what to do, Nero let out a sigh of exasperation before did a jumping.\nOnce he spun around and landed on his feet, his appearance was no longer that of a black cat, but a young man with black hair and golden eyes.\n\"Let me carry him to the gate of the boys' dormitory. I'll leave him there so the gatekeeper will notice it.\"\n\"Do we really have to leave him outside?\"\n\"If we sneak inside and they find us, we're screwed.\"\nAfter saying that, Nero crudely lifted Cyril's body up before carried him onto his shoulder.\n\"Um, Nero, at least give him a piggyback ride…\"\nIgnoring Monica's voice, Nero lightly kicked the ground and started running.\nEventually, Nero's back melted into the night forest before disappearing from sight.",

      "content": "Nero, with Cyril on his shoulders, was running through the forest at night without a single light. Despite in human form, Nero could still see clearly in the night.\nIn addition, he was much stronger than a human, so even with Cyril on his shoulder, he was able to run at full speed.\nHow did this chilly guy get out of the dormitory, I wonder?\nBoth the boys' and girls' dormitories were surrounded by high walls. The gates were guarded by gatekeepers who keep watch throughout the night, so it must not be easy to sneak out.\nIt would be a different story if he could use wind magic to leap or fly, but flight magic was not as easy as it sounds. Monica once told him that only advanced magicians could handle it because it requires both highly precise magic manipulation techniques and physical abilities.\nAside from her magic skills, Monica's physical skills were very terrible, so jumping up high was the best she could do.\nThe way I see it, this chilly guy excels in ice magic, but he doesn't seem to be very good at other magics.\nSince birth, each human is born with a set of attributes that they are good at. It is not uncommon for ordinary magicians to be able to use only their dominant attribute of magic.\nMonica's ability to easily use high-level magic, regardless of the attribute, was quite exceptional in many ways. Sometimes he almost forgot about it.\nI guess this chilly guy can't use wind magic. Well, using this much ice magic at his age is amazing enough, though.\nHow did Cyril, who can't use flight magic, manage to sneak out of the boys' dormitory?\nThe answer was quickly discovered when he reached the back of the boys' dormitory. There was a crack in one of the walls surrounding the dormitory. Apparently, Cyril had snuck out from there.\n\"I guess even the most prestigious schools are sloppy in their management.\"\n\"I heard that crack was used by previous generations of students to sneak out of their dorms and relax.\"\nA response came from behind Nero.\nWith Cyril on his shoulder, Nero turned his head and saw a familiar male student standing there.\nSleek and tall, with a perfect facial structure and golden hair that shines softly under the moonlight—that was the second prince of the Kingdom of Ridill, Felix Ark Ridill.\nIn his uniform, Felix was holding a slightly larger board in his hand.\nOnce Nero turned his attention to the board, Felix propped it up against the wall so that it covered the crack.\n\"Cyril usually puts up a board to hide this crack, but it seems he didn't have enough time to do so.\"\nSo this crack was a loophole that even the prince was familiar with.\nConvinced, Nero put Cyril down from his shoulder.\n\"I'm just a traveler passing by. I came here to deliver this chilly guy who was collapsing in the woods after his magic poisoning got out of control. I'm kind, aren't I? You should be grateful.\"\n\"Yeah, thanks for going to the trouble.\"\n\"If this chilly guy says anything, just tell him he's hallucinating because of his magic poisoning. Everything he's seen is a hallucination.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nFelix glanced at Cyril, then quickly returned his gaze to Nero.\nHis gentle expression did not change—but his blue eyes are watching Nero warily.\n\"A kind traveler. Can I ask you for your name?\"\n\"My name isn't worth mentioning, but since I'm being nice, I'll tell you my name. I'm Bartholomew Alexander.\"\nOnce Nero spoke a lie blatantly, Felix put his hand over his mouth to hold his laugh.\n\"I don't expect you have the same name as the hero of the adventure novel.\"\n\"You know Dustin Gunther?\"\nIn Nero's mind, Felix's likeability has increased a little. Nero firmly believes that there's no bad guy who liked Dustin Gunther.\nAs Nero's voice became more excited, Felix chuckled.\n\"I've enjoyed every kind of entertainment this country has to offer. Whether it's novels, games, theater…\"\n\"Is women too?\"\nWhen Nero, who has witnessed Felix going out for nightlife, pricked him, Felix only smiled vaguely and said, \"I wonder.\"\nWhat a creepy human.\nHe was born into royalty, blessed with all kinds of things—but he has empty eyes, like a person who possessed nothing.\nFelix lightly carried Cyril and then looked at Nero as if he had just recalled something.\n\"By the way, did you know, traveler? The forest in this area is school property, so it's off-limits to everyone except school officials.\"\n\"Oh, is that so?\"\nThe thing that Nero hated was to be forced to follow human rules.\nI'm not human, to begin with.\nDidn't care what kind of rules that humans have made, Nero only indicated Cyril with a tuck of his chin.\n\"I saved that chilly guy of yours. So give me a little slack.\"\n\"Yes, of course. I wouldn't dare question you for saving Cyril's life.\"\n\"Oh?\"\nNero frowned scornfully and thrust his hand into his own robe.\nHe then rummaged around in his clothes and made a gesture as if he was trying to catch something.\n\"You don't have to question me because this guy's going to find out who I am?\"\nWith that, Nero pulled his hand out of his robe.\nAt the tip of his fingers, a white lizard with its tail plucked was swaying placidly.\nNero lifted the white lizard to his face level and threatened to eat it, and the white lizard flailed its small limbs and went wild.\nNero laughed viciously, baring his sharp teeth.\n\"A water spirit, I guess? I'm sure you were planning to sneak a spy in my clothes, but too bad. I'm very sensitive to mana.\"\nA spirit was something like a mass of mana. So, the more high-ranking the spirit was, the more easily Nero could detect it.\nThis white lizard was a high-ranking water spirit. Most likely, the prince's contracted spirit.\nFelix was still smiling serenely when confronted with the white lizard. That's what makes it so creepy.\nAs for Nero, \"W-What!?\" or \"Who the hell are you?\" were the reactions he was expecting. But this prince didn't seem to be the least bit upset.\n\"Bye.\"\nNero boringly threw the white lizard to the ground before turning his back on Felix and walking away.\nHey, sparkling prince. No matter how bored you are, you better not mess with my favorite, okay?\nIf he chattered any longer, his true identity might be noticed. Therefore, Nero only muttered to himself.\nHe bared his sharp teeth and laughed viciously.\nIf you try to break Monica, I'll eat your head off.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThe white lizard that had been thrown to the ground—Will, bowed to Felix once he changed into his human form.\n\"I apologize for my lack of power. Let me go after that man right now…\"\n\"No, that's fine. It would be a problem if you got eaten.\"\nTo Felix's joking remark, Will hanged down his head as if ashamed of his lack of ability.\nFelix had no further intention of chasing after the dark-haired young man.\nHe has no idea who that young man was… but he instinctively knew that he was not someone he could chase down and get rid of.\nHe's sure a non-human. But… he's not a spirit, but something else.\nHowever, whoever that non-human was, as long as he had no intention of harming Felix, he could be left alone for now.\n\"Will, go back to your lizard form. It would be a little inconvenient if Cyril saw you now.\"\n\"As you wish.\"\nWill, who had taken the form of a white lizard, slithered up Felix's leg and settled into his pocket. After confirming this, Felix resumed carrying Cyril on his back and started walking.\nSoon, Cyril moaned softly behind Felix's back. Apparently, he had regained consciousness.\n\"Ugh… I…\"\nFelix spoke calmly to Cyril, who muttered in a hushed voice.\n\"You're awake?\"\n\"Your… Highness…\"\nCyril blinked a few times and looked at Felix with blurry eyes.\n\"You were collapsed in the forest after suffering from magic poisoning. A kind traveler brought you here.\"\n\"I'm sorry to trouble you.\"\n\"No, it's fine.\"\nIf it had been the usual Cyril, he would have immediately said that he would walk by himself. However, the fact that he hadn't was because he was so worn out.\nAfter Felix carried Cyril back to his room, laying him on his bed, Cyril looked up at Felix with dazed eyes.\n\"Is the traveler who helped me a small, hooded figure?\"\nFelix shook his head.\n\"No, he was a tall, dark-haired man.\"\n\"I… see…\"\nMuttering, Cyril closed his eyes.\nSuddenly curious, Felix asked him.\n\"What kind of hallucinations did you have in the forest?\"\nCyril was silent for a moment, seemingly confused. Behind his closed eyelids, he was probably ruminating on the dream he had seen.\nEventually, with his eyes still closed, Cyril slowly opened his mouth.\n\"That monster in my hallucination… was terribly quiet and terribly strong… I probably will never forget that sight for the rest of my life.\"",

      "content": "After stopping Cyril's outburst, Monica returned to her room in the dormitory, and by the time she finished writing the report to submit to Louis, dawn had completely fallen.\nBack when she was living in a mountain cabin, staying up all night was an everyday occurrence, but since she has been living a regular life for a while now, she was feeling heavy-headed.\nAfter walking dizzily to class, having been given another scolding for a bad haircut by Lana, fighting sleepiness throughout the class, Monica dragged her feet to the student council room.\nNo one seemed to have arrived at the student council room yet. Apparently, Monica was the first to arrive today.\nMonica briefly cleaned the student council room as Cyril had taught her, restocked the supplies, and opened the ledger.\nUsually, looking at the numbers would make her become more awake, but right now she couldn't get the numbers into her head at all.\nI see. I've been using a lot of magic yesterday… I don't have enough sugar…\nMonica, who was not fussy about eating, always consumes only the minimum amount of food.\nFor breakfast, she had a piece of bread leftover from dinner and coffee. For lunch, she brought some nuts and water. Normally, this would be enough for her, but after the day of using a lot of magic, that's still not enough for her.\nPerforming magic takes a lot of energy. Therefore, many magicians are said to have sweet tooth.\nMonica rummaged in her pockets for something to eat, but there was nothing to eat since she had eaten all the nuts at lunch.\nJust a little more patience until the student council work is done… so she told herself, but Monica gave in to sleepiness and plopped down at her desk.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nWhile Monica plopped down sleeping on the ledger, someone opened the door to the student council room.\nThe door was opened by the vice president, Cyril Ashley.\nHe was the second person to arrive at the student council room, and when he noticed Monica sleeping on her desk, he raised his eyebrows.\nHe almost opened his mouth to yell at Monica, but… kept his mouth shut.\n\"………\"\nHe unconsciously silencing his footsteps walked up to the desk, then looked down at Monica's figure.\n——She's sure a small girl.\nHer scrawny little body didn't look like that of a seventeen-year-old girl.\nHer complexion was always pale, and her eyes, which could be brown or green depending on the light, were always downcast in fear.\nWithout any noble grace or beauty, she was just a dull girl who could be found anywhere.\nCyril stared down at Monica's right hand, which was still holding the quill.\nAt Serendia Academy, gloves are part of the uniform. Most of the girls wear custom-made gloves, usually with lace or ribbons around the edges, but Monica's gloves were white and unadorned.\nThe gloves were not the right size, or perhaps there was a little too big. That's how small her hands were. Just like a child's.\n\"………\"\nCyril gently picked the quill out of Monica's hand and put it back in the quill holder.\nThe moment the quill was taken out of her hand, Monica's right hand lost its strength, allowing her fingertips to glide across the desk.\nCyril covered Monica's right hand with his own as if to ascertain the smallness of her hand…\n\"Oh, Cyril. You're already here, aren't you?\"\nThe moment he heard Felix's voice from behind, Cyril jumped away from the desk like a grasshopper.\n\"Your Highness, you're wrong, this little girl is napping in the sacred student council room, so I thought I'd wake her up! Come on, wake up, you little girl!!\"\nCyril smacked Monica's head with his right hand, which he lifted unnaturally.\nMonica, who had been plopped down on the desk, raised her upper body with a muffled grunt and looked up at Cyril with eyes that were still mildly sleepy.\n\"…Loord Asshuley?\"\n\"H-Humph, what's with the stupid face? You're in the presence of His Highness! Stand up straight!\"\n\"…9129, 14771, 23900, 38671, 62571, 101242, 163813…\"\n\"Speak in Human language!\"\nWhen Cyril clutched Monica's head in a tremble, but Monica only stared up at Cyril's face and… smiled widely.\n\"… not cold anymore… that's a relief…\"\nCyril's dark blue eyes widened and the hand that was trembling on Monica's head stopped. Unconsciously, his hand had touched the brooch on his lapel.\nWhen Cyril's mouth was opening and closing as he was about to say something, Felix's hand reached out from the side and… shoved one of the cookies into Monica's mouth.\nIn a drowsy stupor, Monica bit down on a cookie, crispily.\nFelix shoved a piece of the cookie, which was gradually getting smaller from the edges, into Monica's mouth, then took out another new cookie and brought it closer to Monica's mouth.\nAfter noticing the cookie pressing against her lips, Monica was still dazedly proceeded to bite into the second cookie.\n\"Interesting. She's half asleep, but her mouth is moving.\"\n\"Um, Y-Your Highness…\"\n\"Do you want to try it too, Cyril?\"\nHis tone of voice sounded as if he was inviting someone to interact with his pet, but Cyril refused it, shaking his head.\nJust as Felix about to pick the third cookie on his hand, Monica's head snapped up and her eyes opened slightly.\nMonica rubbed her eyes and mumbled something in an indistinct voice as if she had just woken up from sleep.\nAt this time, Monica was thinking about the report she had stayed up all night writing.\nFor Monica, writing reports was one of the tasks she was very bad at.\nI hope Louis wouldn't get mad at me… was what all Monica could think about, and the young man yelling at her in front of her seemed to overlap with Louis Miller.\nSo she was saying.\n\"Congratulations on your wife's pregnancy!\"\n\"Who are you talking about?!\"\nTo the shouting Cyril, Felix softly said.\n\"Cyril, who is it? You have to take responsibility for your actions, okay?\"\n\"Ah, Your Highness! No, it's a misunderstanding. This little girl is just talking nonsense in her sleep…!\"\nThere was Cyril who's shouting with bloodshot eyes, Felix who's smiling happily, and Monica who's still dozed off.\nNo one had noticed this, but that scene caused Neil, the fourth boy who arrived at the student council room, to pause at the entrance with a troubled look on his face.",

      "content": "Lindsey Pale, a teacher at Serendia Academy (26-year-old, bachelor, currently looking for a nice gentleman), was in a state of shock. She was a ballroom dance teacher. However, most of the students at Serendia Academy were children of noble families. As a result, the students had already taken up ballroom dancing by the time they entered the school, and even though some of them were not very good at it, none of them had ever failed their exam before.\n…Yes. It was until now.\nWhat on earth is the scene that unfolded in front of me?\nThought Pale who widened her eyes.\nOne couple dancing in front of her. The male student's name was Glenn Dudley. The female student's name was Monica Norton. Both of them were students who had just transferred to the second year of high school.\n\"I feel our tempo is lagging a bit, so let's speed it up!\"\n\"Nooooo! Please stoooop!\"\nThe female student, who has no sense of rhythm at all, was being pushed around by the male student, who was pacing up at twice the original tempo… no, rather than dancing turning each other around, they're more like spinning around.\nIt was nowhere near what you would call a dance. If anything, it was the image of a large dog running around at will and its owner holding the leash, being dragged around. The male student was hurling, twirling, and dragging the female student around.\nThen again, if you ask me if it is only the male student who has the problem, that is not the case.\nThe female student was the same way. She didn't even know the basics of dancing and her steps were a mess. It was a miracle that they hadn't fallen until now.\nEventually, as soon as the song ended, Monica Norton, unable to withstand the momentum of the sudden stop, rolled vigorously across the floor and eventually hit the wall, twitching.\nRunning up to Monica, who has swirly eyes, Glenn shook Monica's shoulders and shouted.\n\"Oops, my bad! H-Hey, are you okay?\"\n\"P-Please… don't… shake me…\"\nTo Monica, who had turned white and stopped moving, Glenn exclaimed.\n\"Please don't die!!!\"\nYou're the one who put her to an end… was what everyone thought in the room.\nWatching the ridiculous exchange, teacher Pale announced to the two misfits.\n\"Glenn Dudley. Monica Norton. I will have both of you take a re-examination in one week.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nMonica was one of the top magicians in the Kingdom of Ridill, and one of the Seven Sages who had been granted the right to meet the king face to face.\nTwo years ago, at the age of fifteen, she has become the youngest person ever to be chosen as one of the Seven Sages. She was the only existing magician to use non-chanting spells and was a prodigy known for having developed several new spell formulas.\nHave been ordered to secretly escort the second prince, Felix Ark Ridill, she then infiltrated Serendia Academy. While secretly escorting the prince by making full use of her specialty of non-chanting magic, she was able to enjoy leisurely and splendid school life… or not.\nAlthough Monica has outstanding grades in the fields of magic and mathematics, when it comes to the other fields, she was at the bottom of the heap. A clumsy among the clumsy.\nOne particular example of this was her terrible lack of physical ability.\nJust doing a run for a bit would leave her out of breath, and stumbling over nothing has become her daily occurrence.\nThe fact that she had been holed up in a mountain cabin for the past two years after becoming the Seven Sages, almost never going out, only added to the decline in her strength.\n…The end result of her ballroom dancing performance was a catastrophe.\nThe ballroom dancing class was held jointly between the two classes, which their partners were basically appointed by the teacher. That was decided so to make sure the students were paired up with those of similar abilities.\nMonica's partner was Glenn Dudley from the next class over.\nApparently, Glenn was a student who transferred at the same time as Monica. Although that golden brown-haired boy was a bit peculiar, he has a very friendly smile.\nGlenn was taller than most boys his age, and Monica, who was smaller in that regard, had to look far up to see Glenn's face.\nFrankly speaking, the gap in their height made them unsuitable as dance partners, but the reason why the teacher chose them as a pair was probably because they were both transfer students, and their dancing skills were relatively unknown.\n\"My name is Glenn! Nice to meet you!\"\nGlenn said this with a friendly smile, but the best Monica could do was hanging her head down fidgeting.\nMonica's extreme shyness makes it difficult for her to have a proper conversation with people she has never met before—especially when it comes to men.\nStill, Glenn didn't seem to be offended and stood in the dance hall holding Monica's hand.\nHis confident demeanor made Monica think that he must be a good dancer.\nBut, in the next moment, Glenn said with a friendly smile.\n\"I've never done any ballroom dancing before. At least, I'm going to try to imitate what I've seen!\"\nYou're lying, right? The second she thought of that, Monica was swept away by Glenn.\nThus, they were both given a re-examination together.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nIf this continues, they will inevitably fail at the re-examination as well.\nThat's why they decided to borrow a room to practice dancing after school.\nNevertheless, with two beginners, there was nothing they could do about it.\nSo Glenn said, \"I've brought a helper!\" and dragged a certain person along with him.\n\"Oh… Hi.\"\nGlenn dragged in Neil Clay Maywood who had a troubled look on his face and was also a student council member like Monica.\n\"L-Lord… Maywood…?\"\nWhile Monica widened her eyes at the appearance of Neil, who she regarded as the most kindhearted student council, Glenn looked at Monica and Neil in turn, curiously.\n\"Huh? You two know each other?\"\n\"Miss Norton is also a student council member, like me.\"\n\"Eeeeh!? I didn't know that!\"\nGlenn exaggeratedly turned his head and gazed down at Monica.\nGlenn may not be a bad person, but his voice was too loud for Monica's ears.\nWhile she's shivering with fear, Glenn nodded his head in admiration.\n\"Monica is a transfer student like me, isn't she? And yet she's already become student council, that's amazing!\"\n\"No… that's…\"\n\"Oh, I'm sorry for calling you by your name! But I'm not good at being formal, so please call me Glenn instead!\"\n\"Um… Er…\"\nWhile Monica was struggling with her response, Neil calmly intervened, \"Please leave it at that.\"\n\"Miss Norton's troubled, so don't press her too hard.\"\nWhen Neil said this, Glenn went silent like an attentive dog.\nAlthough Neil was a small and modest boy, he was well-liked by the people around him. Glenn also seemed to adore Neil.\nNeil made sure that Glenn was quiet and smiled, lowering his eyebrows to reassure Monica.\n\"Glenn is a classmate of mine. He asked me to watch him practice his dance, so I agreed to be his temporary instructor.\"\n\"I-I'm sorry… for the inconvenience…\"\n\"Not at all. In times of trouble, we have to help each other.\"\nThe smiling Neil, who said this, exuded an aura of a good person from his entire body. That's why people love him.\n\"Well then, let's practice right away!\"\nTo Glenn, who spoke impatiently like a dog that can't wait, Neil gave him a troubled look.\n\"If possible, I'd like you're practicing with music like the real performance… And since I need to watch your dancing, it would be better if there's someone who could play the piano.\"\nThere's a piano set up in the dance room for performance. During the exam, students have to dance according to the music played on.\nBut Monica didn't have anyone she knew who could play the piano… Or rather, she didn't have anyone she knew well at this school in the first place.\nAs Monica turned her head apologetically, the door to the dance room swung open.\n\"Well, I guess I don't have a choice! I'll play the piano for you if you want!\"\nIt was Monica's classmate, Lana Collette, who spoke quickly while curling her flaxen hair around her finger. Apparently, she was eavesdropping at the door.\nGlenn and Neil looked surprised, alternately looking at Monica and Lana.\n\"Are you Monica's friend?\"\n\"…yes…\"\nNodding quickly at Glenn's question, Monica turned pale.\nWould Lana not find it annoying to be called her friend?\nIf Lana looked uncomfortable or if she frowned even a little bit—while Monica shuddering at the thought of such a scene, Lana drew closer to Monica before ruffled her hair with pride.\n\"That's right! You should be grateful because I, your friend, is going to help you!\"\nMonica raised up her face timidly to look at Lana.\nLana didn't look annoyed in the slightest. In fact, she seemed to be holding back her smile.\n\"Thank you…\"\nMonica squeezed her chest over her uniform and thanked her in a faint voice.\nShe had a feeling if she didn't hold her chest, her heart would jump out of her chest with joy.",

      "content": "\"Oh, Neil had told me about you. He said you're practicing your dancing.\"\nHave been showing up at the student council room later than usual, Felix smiled and said so.\nMonica had completely forgotten to report that she was having dance practice after school, but apparently, the thoughtful Neil had notified Felix. Although he was low-key, he was quite capable.\nAs he returned the quill he was holding to its stand, Felix cast a glance at Neil.\n\"So, how's the practice going? Can she pass the re-examination?\"\nNeil's gaze darting around, even though it wasn't hot, his sweat beading on his cheeks.\n\"Well… I guess it depends on how much effort she put from now on…\"\n\"Your Highness, for the good-natured general affairs Maywood to go so far as to say that, it must be an absolutely appalling situation.\"\nCyril, who was working on something else besides him, asserted in a stern tone.\nMonica couldn't say anything back but shrugged wistfully.\nWhat Cyril said was indeed true. Today's practice was a disaster. It was hard to say that any progress had been made.\nThey started by practicing basic steps, but one out of every few times Monica would get her feet tangled and fall down. Glenn, on the other hand, seemed to have good physical skills and learned the steps quickly.\nNeil and Lana both said that it's best to learn these things with the body, but her body didn't seem to be able to pick it up.\nIf there were numbers, I could remember them all! so she was secretly lamenting, but Bridget, who was sitting by the window writing some papers, opened her mouth without moving her eyes from her papers.\n\"As a student council member who becomes the role model for the students, you should be ashamed of yourself… for falling behind in class.\"\n\"I-I'm sorry…\"\n\"Are you aware that you're also causing trouble for Lord Maywood?\"\nTo Monica's trembling apology, Bridget spoke more sharply.\nBecause of her, she's caused trouble for someone else—this fact sent Monica reeling.\nThat's right, because of her inability to dance well, she was causing trouble for both Lana and Neil.\nAlthough in the beginning, Glenn was a bit of a mess, given his good physical skills, he would soon able to improve more than Monica.\nIf that happens, what Monica did would only cause trouble for Glenn. If by any chance Glenn also fails the exam because of his partner, which was her…\n\"Um, I-I never considered you a nuisance, so…\"\nWhen the good-natured Neil said this in flustered, Elliot, who had been silent until now spinning his quill, interrupted him.\n\"Miss Bridget is right. Student council members are role models for the students. If there's a member who can't even pass a ballroom dance exam, it wouldn't set a good example for the rest of the students.\"\nElliot's eyes narrowed in a dangerous light as he looked at Monica, smirking.\n\"At this rate, this will become a matter of His Highness's appointment responsibility, won't it?\"\nIt was Felix who had appointed the outcast Monica as treasurer… So if Monica causes any problems, it would also be Felix's fault for choosing Monica.\nBecause of her, she would cause trouble not only for Lana, Neil, and Glenn but also for Felix.\nThe fear and pressure seemed to be crushing Monica's small body.\nI'm sorry for causing you trouble, I will work hard and do my best, so please forgive me—Such words were running through her head, but her throat constricted, unable to speak.\nAs Monica tried to move her mouth, Felix said calmly.\n\"I told you before, didn't I? That if she ever made any mistakes, I'd take the responsibility.\"\nWhen Felix opened his mouth, the atmosphere in the student council room changed.\nFelix smiling gracefully before declaring.\n\"You have nothing to worry about, Miss Norton is the person I have chosen. I know she will live up to my expectations. Don't you agree? Miss Norton.\"\nThe last words were directed to Monica, and they were accompanied by a wide smile.\nI can't do it, I just can't\n, so she screamed inwardly, but Monica swallowed her words just in time.\nSince Felix, a member of the royal family, told her that he had high expectations for her, Monica had no choice but to respond.\nHowever, she still couldn't nod easily, instead remained face down, so Felix stood up and walked over to Monica. He then put his finger on Monica's chin and made her look at him.\nMysterious blue eyes peered down at the languid Monica.\n\"You won't… let me down, will you?\"\nThe slightly wistful voice would have made most girls blush. But Monica felt like she was a victim of blackmail, so she could only shake her head.\nMonica gathered up all the words she could find in her mind.\nA logical and clear explanation is important when stating one's intentions.\n\"F-First of all… I need the analysis of the tempo of songs used and the matching of stride length. I'd like to start by analyzing and memorizing the angles of the feet, hips, and shoulders during the dance!\"\nAt Monica's words, which seemed logical at first glance, but were not logical at all, Cyril with one his eyes half-closed, lamented.\n\"…little girl, before you start using your head, try moving your body first.\"\nAnd that's the most plausible method.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAfter returning to the attic, collapsed on the bed with her face down, Monica was sniffling. Having done the unaccustomed exercise had made her legs ached.\n\"Monica, you look like a haggard old lady.\"\nStill keeping her face on the bed, Nero jumped on top of her back and squeezed it with his paw. Apparently, he was giving her a massage.\n\"Ugh… My whole body is aching…\"\n\"I heard early sore muscles is a sign of a young body. Good for you.\"\nShe wondered where in the world he had learned such knowledge.\nNero squeezed Monica's stick-like legs, which were devoid of fat and muscle, with his paws.\n\"I have been secretly watching you from the window, is it what that so-called dancing is? Does it mean that the person who steps on the opponent's foot the most wins?\"\n\"Ugh, no, it's not… You know, you've seen it in the illustrations of the novel…\"\n\"It was a shock to me because I only knew it from the illustrations. I had no idea dancing was such a tough competition.\"\nNero jumped onto the desk and dexterously flipped the pages of the novel book he had spread out with his paw.\nThen he tapped at the sentence with his paw tensely.\n\"…Julia lets herself be swept away by the music… It was truly a dreamlike time. Holding each other hands, each step following their hearts.\"\n\"So these characters stepped on each other's feet with their hearts. Wow, that changes my interpretation of this scene.\"\n\"…I told you it wasn't… Sheesh.\"\nMonica puffed out her cheeks before glaring at Nero, who teasingly wagged his tail.\n\"I mean, can't you just use a spell to deal with that kind of thing? You can use spells without chanting, right? Then, why not use a spell to secretly get better at dancing?\"\nThe spell that makes you a better dancer… How good it would be if there were such a convenient thing. But spells are not all-powerful.\n\"It is theoretically possible to manipulate the body to make it move in a certain way, but… that spell is forbidden in this country.\"\nUsing a spell to move a human body, or to temporarily strengthen muscles, was considered taboo in this country.\nBecause human bodies were not resistant to mana, it can cause side effects such as mana poisoning. For the same reason, the use of healing spells was also prohibited.\nAccording to past experiments, just to close up a small cut, a large amount of mana was required, but it resulted in the death of the magician and the death of the person receiving the treatment due to mana poisoning.\nWhen Monica gave that explanation, Nero's whiskers twitched.\n\"Hmm? Wait. You say \"In this country\"? Could it be that spells were allowed in another country?\"\nMonica thought about Nero's question for a while.\nNero wasn't familiar with the human situation, and it would be good for him to know what level of spells humans were capable of.\nMonica straightened up her posture and then said with a serious face.\n\"Physical manipulation, physical control, physical enhancement, and healing… All spells performed on the human body are treated as forbidden. All the magicians' guilds on this continent are in agreement regarding it as forbidden spells, but… with one exception.\"\nTrailing off her words, Monica put a little more strength into the fists she clenched in her lap.\n\"It's the Eastern Empire.\"\nThe Empire, which bordered on the east of the Kingdom of Ridill, was the strongest and most vast nation on this continent.\nAbout a year ago, the emperor was replaced by a young emperor who was just over 20 years old, but this young emperor was not willing to accept old customs and has been implementing new policies one after another—one of which was the lifting of the ban on spells related to medical use.\nIn other words, the emperor gave permission for a limited amount of research into the spell that affected the body.\nThis policy was naturally opposed by the magicians' guild in the empire. But then, rumor has it that the chief of that guild died in a suspicious death.\nIn other words, things were looking a little fishy.\n\"I imagine that physical enhancement and healing spells will develop more in the Empire in the future…\"\nThe lifting of the ban on spells related to medical use in the empire had a profound effect on magicians in other countries as well.\nMore and more magicians have abandoned their own countries because of their strict policies and moved to the empire.\nLosing talented magicians to other countries has been a headache for every country, and it has been discussed several times at the Seven Sages assembly.\nAbove all, Monica herself had her own thoughts about the lifting of the ban on spells that related to medical use.\n\"Humans have a lot on their minds, don't they?\"\nNero slammed the cover of his novel shut and muttered to himself.\n\"I guess so…\"\nMuttering, Monica closed her eyes.\nBehind her eyelids, she could feel a faint glimpse of her father's back.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThat night, Monica had a nostalgic dream.\nIt was a dream where she watching her father's back as he sat at his desk. He was always doing a lot of difficult calculations, and Monica had treated his formulas as a picture book.\nHer father was knowledgeable.\nMathematics, physics, pharmacology, medicine—He had studied all kinds of subjects, but biology was his specialty.\n—\nThe human body is made up of a huge amount of numbers.\nIf one could define humans with mathematical equations, they could help a lot of people suffering from diseases.\nThat's why her father spent all his time researching, day in and day out.\nMonica didn't get to play with him much, but she still enjoyed reading her father's collection of books, and just being able to hear about her father's research once in a while was enough to make her happy… She was happy, but…\nThe scenery in her dream changed.\nHer father's back was engulfed in red flames, obscuring his vision.\nThe sight of his father burning along with the huge amount of data and formulas that he had written down.\nStop! Stop! Stoopp!\nShe wanted to scream, but the words were stuck in her throat and wouldn't come out.\nAs Monica stood there, stunned, a man stared down at her.\nHe was the second prince of this country, a person perfectly fit with the white uniform of Serendia Academy. Felix Ark Ridill.\n\"You won't… let me down, will you?\"\nMonica stared up blankly at Felix, who whispered those words with a sweet smile.\nThis is a dream.\nFelix had nothing to do with his father's death. Today events and the memories of the past were just mixed up in a jumbled mess.\nStill, every time someone expects her to do something, the dark emotions she felt in the past tighten their grip on Monica's heart.\nIt caused some faint anger to well up inside Monica's chest.\nHow can they say that I will live up to his expectations?\nEven though my dad had lived up to their expectations, he wasn't rewarded…",

      "content": "The following day at lunchtime, Monica hurried out of the school building and headed for the backyard.\nAvoiding the old garden, which she had sneaked into before, because of the possibility of running into Felix, Monica moved to a secluded corner of the backyard.\nThen, making sure that no one was around, she took a piece of paper out of her pocket and unfolded it.\nOn the paper, she had written down the basic steps of ballroom dancing and the tempo of the song. Monica reviewed what Neil had taught her yesterday and put it down on a piece of paper.\nAfter carefully re-reading it, Monica immediately started practicing the basic steps.\n\"1, 2, 3… 1, 2, 3…\"\nIt was just a matter of repeating the same steps, but when Monica, who has poor athletic skills, did it, her upper body would wobble unsteadily. Even just doing that was difficult for her.\n\"Let's see… put my right foot forward, take my left foot out to the side, put it back in, then… turn clockwise with my left foot as the axis.\"\nWhen turning around, losing her balance and stumbling, she heard a burst of laughter.\nHer shoulders jerked involuntarily and she looked up to see a tall young man looking at Monica with a smirk on his face, wondering how long he had been there.\nHe has reddish brown-colored hair and droopy eyes. The young man who looks so friendly when he's not talking was the student council secretary, Elliot Howard.\n\"No wonder it was this terrible. Your dance almost like a drunk person.\"\nElliot's demeanor was friendly and easy-going, but his eyes were clearly looking down on Monica.\nAlthough they were the same student council members, Monica had not talked to Elliot very much.\nHowever, she had a vague feeling that Elliot did not have good feelings for Monica.\nIf Brigitte's sharp words were like a sword, then this person's words were like poison. She can feel his malicious intent slowly tormenting Monica.\n\"Have you not ever attended a ball before?\"\n\"No, I haven't…\"\n\"Haha, I guess it's natural. That kind of dance couldn't be displayed in the public, after all.\"\nElliot spat out his poison, with a soft tone and a soft smile, as if he were making chitchat.\nMonica was stood there shriveling, while Elliot slowly closed the distance between them before looking down at Monica's face.\n\"You're not a noble, are you?\"\n\"………\"\n\"Most likely you're a child born from a nobleman's mistress, right? …I guess that's not too far off the mark, huh?\"\nShe wondered what kind of setting Louis had devised. As a matter of fact, it was so complicated that she couldn't remember much about it.\nIf I recall correctly… I was an orphan who was adopted by the former Count Kelbeck's wife… right?\nAt any rate, it would be best not to say anything inappropriate. When Monica silently looked down, Elliot seemed to take it as a bull's-eye.\n\"Serendia Academy has become an extension of the social circle. And student council members are the flower of the social circle.\"\nAs the second prince, Felix has chosen the members of the student council, it's no exaggeration to say that the student council members are his future aides or potential wives.\nIn such a gorgeous place, Monica was a thorn who blended in.\n\"Nobles have their own roles and duties. To be honest, I don't like the idea of a commoner with no aspirations mixed in.\"\nReaching out his hand, Elliot picked up Monica's badge from her lapel.\nHe then tossed it up high into the air.\nA small badge that proved her membership, fell with a thud onto the decorative part of the roof of the school building. It's far too high for Monica to reach.\n\"…ah.\"\nAs Monica stood there, Elliot sneered at her.\n\"I have never heard of members losing their badge. Stripping off your position might be inevitable.\"\nElliot shrugged his shoulders dramatically before looking down coldly at Monica.\n\"Glad to see you understand your place. Miss commoner.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAfter Elliot walked away, Monica was looking up at the school building with a troubled look on her face.\nHer badge that fell on the roof of the school building can be retrieved by using flight magic… but it will be difficult for Monica, who can barely leap high enough, to do so.\nAbove all, if someone found out, it would be a disaster.\n\"W-What do I do?\"\nWould making strong wind with a wind spell make it fall off the roof? However, if the wind accidentally blows away from the roof as well, it will be a disaster.\nWhen she thought about calling Nero to get it for her… someone tapped Monica on the shoulder.\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\"Yesh!?\"\nAs Monica turned around, cowering, she saw Glenn Dudley standing there. For some reason, Glenn was holding a wooden skewer in one hand.\nDon't tell me he's going to kill me by stabbing that wooden skewer to my neck…!?\nor so Monica thought as she stared at the wooden skewer that Glenn waving like a baton before saying.\n\"What are you doing out here?\"\n\"Um… Er…\"\nAs Monica was at a loss for words, Glenn stared at Monica's lapel.\n\"Hey, your lapel is a little loose, isn't it? Aah! Where's your badge! Did you drop it?\"\nMonica replied hesitantly to Glenn, who started to make a lot of noise.\n\"Um, my badge… was got stuck… on that roof over there…\"\nIt was a rather lame excuse. But Glenn didn't pry any further, he placed his hands over his eyes and looked up at the roof.\n\"Do you mean that roof, with that decoration?\"\n\"P-Probably… somewhere around there.\"\n\"Then it's easy!\"\nAs Monica widened her eyes, wondering what he meant by it's easy, Glenn was, \"Hold this for me!\" then gave her a wooden skewer that he was holding.\nThen, after snapping his neck, he chanted a short incantation.\nMonica's eyes widened. What Glenn was chanting was a flight magic spell.\nWhen Glenn kicked the ground with a light \"Here we go,\" his body leaped immediately to the height of the roof. Maintaining that height, Glenn's body moved horizontally approaching the roof.\n\"Found it!\"\nPicking up the badge on the roof, Glenn descended slowly from over four stories building and landed in front of Monica.\nThe flying spell was a high-level spell that can only be used by an advanced magician. Above all, it required both magic knowledge and physical ability.\nMonica was surprised at how easily Glenn used it, and Glenn put the badge in Monica's hand before putting his index finger to his lips with a \"shhh\".\n\"Don't tell the others about that, okay? In fact, I've been told not to use magic without supervisor permission.\"\n\"Um… are you a magician… Glenn?\"\n\"I'm still an apprentice, though!\"\nEven as an apprentice, being able to use a flight spell means that he was as skilled as an advanced magician.\nWhy would such a person be at Serendia Academy?\nIf he could use a flight spell at such a young age, it would not be surprising if he was recruited by Minerva, an institution specializing in the training of magicians.\nUnable to say such a question, Glenn picked the wooden skewer from Monica's hand.\n\"Oh, I was just about having my lunch. Would you like to join me?\"\nNow that he mentioned it, she could smell some kind of meat being grilled.\nWaving the wooden skewer in a good mood, Glenn walked deeper into the backyard. Fearfully following him, she found the remains of a bonfire in a slightly open area. On top of a leaf, which served as a plate, was a skewer of roasted meat. Apparently, the wooden skewers were used to skewer this meat.\n\"You know, this school's cafeteria is kind of uptight, and besides its high price, the portions are too small, so it was not enough to fill my belly.\"\n\"T-That's why… you grill some meat here?\"\n\"When it comes to meat, freshly butchered is the best! Besides, I won't have energy if I don't eat my fill of meat!\"\nWith that, Glenn offered Monica one of his skewers.\nUnable to say no, Monica thanked him and took a bite of the meat without hesitation. The chicken was grilled just right, the skin was crispy and the meat was moist and tender. The spices were also spread evenly which was good.\nBut where did he get this meat from?\nEarlier, Glenn seemed to have said something like \"freshly butchered\", but he couldn't have been hunting during the break, could he?\nIn response to Monica's puzzled expression, Glenn answered as he chewed on the meat.\n\"My family owns a butcher shop in the downtown area. I flew in with my flight spell to pick up the meat from my parents' house! Oh, don't tell anyone I went to my parents' house! Don't tell anyone, okay?! Absolutely don't tell anyone, okay?!\"\nAlthough she had suspected it for some time, Glenn seemed not from the noble family.\nBut why would a butcher's son, an apprentice magician, who was not from the nobility, enroll in this academy?\n\"Um, why did you… decide to enroll in this school, Glenn?\"\n\"Hmm, I have a master who teaches me spells… My master told me that I was too restless, so my enrollment in this school was to learn how to behave.\"\nAlthough Serendia Academy was built for the children of noble families, it was not uncommon for children of semi-aristocratic or wealthy families to enroll their children in the school to learn some mannerisms.\nNevertheless, if someone was as talented in magic as Glenn, attending Minerva, the pinnacle of magician training institutes, should be a natural choice.\nI wonder who is his master.\n\"Thank you very much… Thank you for taking the badge for me, and also for the meat…\"\n\"In times of trouble, we should all help each other!\"\nGlenn smiled pleasantly, showing his white teeth.\nLooking at his carefree smile, she felt that her dislike for him had faded a little.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nHmm?\nFelix watched the exchange between Monica and Glenn in the backyard from the window and squinted a little.\nHe had seen the entire exchange—from Monica secretly practicing her dance moves to Elliot stealing her badge, to Glenn retrieving it with flight magic.\n\"…Your Highness.\"\nWill, the white lizard, peeked out of his breast pocket and whispering to him.\n\"I have been listening to some of the conversations, and looks like there is no connection between Monica Norton and Glenn Dudley.\"\n\"Yeah, I guess so. She was quite surprised when Glenn Dudley using a flight spell.\"\nAfter saying that much, Felix let out a sigh with a languid look on his face.\n\"Still, it wasn't funny. Why are all of them ganging over bullying my little squirrel?\"\n\"I believe it's because Your Highness is also bullying her.\"\n\"Shall I put a collar on her so as to let them know she's mine? Maybe a pretty ribbon with some embroidery on it will do.\"\n\"I think that would be looked bad on you.\"\n\"I have got the same feeling.\"\nGiggling, Felix covered his breast pocket with his hand. As a signal for him to hide, Will withdrew deep into his pocket.\nAfter confirming that Will had withdrawn, Felix turned his gaze behind him. The person walking towards him was the student council secretary, Elliot Howard. He was the one who had just taken away the badge from Monica.\nFelix had anticipated him to walk through this corridor to get back to the classroom, so he had taken the trouble to wait here for him.\nWhen Elliot noticed Felix, he lifted one hand in a friendly manner.\n\"Yo, Your HIghness.\"\n\"Oh, Elliot. Did you have fun playing with the little squirrel?\"\nElliot didn't seem to be upset and looked at Felix with his usual frivolous smile plastered on his face. That's a very typical attitude of an aristocrat.\n\"Say, Your Highness. I think you already know that I really hate commoners who don't know their place.\"\nElliot Howard may pretend to be a frivolous man, but his nature has always been more aristocratic than anyone else.\nIt's not that Elliott looks down on the commoners. It's just that he can't tolerate people who do not fulfill their duties… whether they were nobles or commoners.\nFelix was aware that Elliot was the one who was more upset than anyone else about the previous accounting irregularities.\n\"You once said, didn't you, Elliot? Nobles have their roles, common people have their roles. Each of us should play our role according to their standing…\"\n\"Yeah, I did. That's why I'm asking you.\"\nElliot retracted his frivolous smile and looked sharply at Felix with his drooping eyes.\n\"Why did you make Monica Norton the treasurer?\"\n\"Because I don't know where Miss Norton's ‘standing' is.\"\nElliot argued that common people should play roles that fit the status of common people. Felix, however, could not grasp Monica's \"standing\". That's why he assigned her the role of treasurer. He thought that by doing so, he might be able to grasp her true nature.\nElliot did not seem to be satisfied with Felix's answer. Still, he did not pursue the matter any further and turned his cold eyes on Felix.\n\"Do you know what I hate more than \"the common people who don't know their place\"? And nobles who don't do their duty… That goes for royalty as well.\"\nFelix was not offended by his disrespectful attitude towards royalty and replied with a gentle smile.\n\"Of course, as long as I call myself Felix Ark Ridill, I will fulfill the duty of my role.\"\n—Right, as long as I carry this name.\nWith eyes that seemed to be looking somewhere far away, Felix whispered faintly to himself.",

      "content": "That day, two more observers came to the after-school dance training.\nThey were Felix Ark Ridill, the student council president, and Cyril Ashley, the vice president.\nWhen these two appeared, Lana's cheeks turned rosy and squealed in high-pitched voices.\nWhile Monica screamed in terror inwardly in pale expression.\nAs for Neil, he looked at Felix and Cyril awkwardly, while Glenn said loudly, \"Who are these people?\" And they were some big figure.\n\"-W-Why… w-was Y-Your Highness… h-here…\"\nWhen Monica said this in a low voice, Felix furrowed his eyebrows and gave her a look of disbelief.\n\"I'm not so heartless as to have expected you then only to throw you out later, okay?\"\n\"Right, you should be grateful for Your Highness's generosity!\"\nCyril then stuck out his chest proudly.\nAre you okay came here leaving your student council work behind…\nor so thought secretly Monica when Felix glanced at Cyril.\n\"By the way, I don't remember having called you here, Cyril.\"\n\"I'm Your Highness's bodyguard! It is only natural that I should accompany you along!\"\n\"I see. So you've been getting your student council work done ahead of schedule even before I told you I was planning to come here. You were planning on coming to watch Monica practice from the beginning. And even if I didn't show up here, you're planning to come here, weren't you?\"\nFor some reason, Cyril embarrassed at Felix's ridiculous remarks which made his gaze wander.\n\"W-Well… As your right-hand man, I had anticipated some of Your Highness's plan, after all!\"\nMonica was secretly impressed by the fact that the vice president had to always be ready for the president's whims.\nHowever, to be honest, this situation did not make Monica happy. In fact, it has become a burden on her mind.\nAs Monica's stomach knotted up in anguish, Lana was shaking her shoulder.\n\"Hey, look at that! Student council president and vice president are standing side by side, so close together!\"\nLana's exuberant was probably the correct reaction of most of the girls… so thought Monica.\n\"Look at His Highness' scarf embroidery, such delicate and beautiful needlework… It's definitely the work of a master craftsman. The colors of the embroidered thread changes depending on its luster… and also those embroidered vine patterns, they will definitely become a trend. I need to burn it in my memory, and if possible, I would like to draw it down… Ah, look at the lace on the edge of Lord Cyril's gloves! That's not something made without the latest technique… I'd like to see it up more closely…\"\n\"………\"\nWhat Lana was staring at was not the faces of Felix and Cyril, but their clothes and accessories.\nPerhaps Lana was also a little different from what most schoolgirls think.\nWhile Monica was dumbfounded at that thought, Felix was encouraging while saying to her, \"How about showing your dancing first?\" with a smile. Monica did as she was told, standing in the middle of the room before holding Glenn's hand.\nLana hurriedly sat down at the piano and began to play. Neil clapped his hands along with the music.\n\"Alright, I will start with a one-two-three as a signal.\"\n\"Okay!\"\n\"One, two, three.\"\nMonica and Glenn took their first steps at the same time. It wasn't a bad start. This was because Monica was less nervous around Glenn than she had been yesterday.\nHowever, after a few repetitions of the steps, their rhythm started to go wrong.\n\"Stop!\"\nCyril was the one who raised his voice.\nAh, she sure her dancing had ruined the dance or so thought Monica shrinking into her shoulders.\nLana stopped her music, and Cyril glared at Glenn sharply.\n\"Glenn Dudley! You are not escorting her properly! You had better learn to control your manners towards girls!\"\nIt was a very unbelievable statement from someone who abuses Monica on a daily basis.\nMonica, who had been expecting that she would be the one to be criticized, widened her eyes in disbelief.\nOn the other hand, Glenn, who had been ruined the dance complained, with his lips pursed in a boo-boo.\n\"I've been treating her carefully though.\"\n\"In the first place, you haven't even properly asking her for a dance! Watch me over there!\"\nCyril pushed Glenn away haughtily before staring down at Monica, who was scared out sniffling.\nLooking at the flow, surely Cyril will be Monica's dancing partner, right?\nIf I accidentally stepped on his foot, he might shove a block of ice to me…\nor so Monica shuddering at thought of that when Cyril placed his left hand behind his own back, bow gracefully, before reaching out his right hand.\n\"Will you dance with me, young lady?\"\n\"…huh?\"\nMonica's thoughts froze at the graceful bow and the dialogue that didn't seem to belong to Cyril.\nStanding there in a daze, Cyril reached out and took Monica's hand with as much care as if he were touching a delicate piece of glass.\nAs soon as Lana started to play her music, Cyril lightly put his hand on Monica's waist. By the movement of his hand, Monica subconsciously understood that the dance was about to begin. Even without a signal \"one-two-three\" like she did with Glenn, she knew what to do as it natural. She even knew the timing of the first step.\nAs if lured by Cyril's hand, Monica stepped forward, one, two, three, one, two, three… Too busy worrying about her steps, Monica's upper body movement inevitably became a mess.\nBut when Monica's back and arms started to do a wrong move, Cyril's hands supported her to get into the right position.\nThe same goes for the direction of travel. If it was Glenn, he would say, \"Let's go to the right!\" then \"We're about to run into a wall, so go that way!\" to indicate the direction of travel vocally. But Cyril didn't guide Monica with his words but with the movement of his hands, his feet, and his gaze.\n—And for her, it was surprisingly easy to dance with.\nAfter the music was over, Cyril gave the same beautiful bow as when he started. He then raised his head to look at Glenn and…\n\"Did you see that, kid? This is what escorting is all about!\"\nHe yelled at him, looking proud of himself.\nFar from being when he's dancing, he was the usual Cyril Ashley that Monica knew.\nMonica couldn't help but mutter to herself.\n\"I was relieved to see that Lord Ashley was still the same as usual.\"\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\nAfter Cyril glared at Monica, he coughed.\n\"You could say that ballroom dancing is entirely dependent on how the male doing a lead. If the male leads properly and matches the timing to the music, the dance will look good to some extent.\"\nAt Cyril's explanation, Glenn cheered honestly.\n\"Oh, that's awesome!\"\n\"When you're going to compliment someone, you should use better vocabulary, and compliment them with a word of decency.\"\nCyril seemed less than pleased but still maintained his cynical attitude.\nGlenn pondered about ‘use better vocabulary' for a moment, then opened his mouth with a serious face.\n\"Your movements went like whoosh, swish, and snap, and it was cool!\"\n\"Before you learn etiquette, you should learn the human language.\"\nCyril gave Glenn a half-hearted glare, and now he looked at Monica.\n\"Monica Norton. Your dancing needs a lot of work. First of all, you need to get used to being escorted. Don't freak out every time. Don't hunch over. Don't look down. A few missed steps will go unnoticed as long as you keep your head held high.\"\n\"Y-Yes…\"\nCyril's point was something that both the teacher and Neil had said to her.\nIn any case, her habit of hunching over and looking down, caused Monica to always take a bad posture.\nNow that he mentions it, at the rehearsal for the Seven Sages ceremony, Louis pointed out to me that I was hunched over… I remember having a pole tied to my back.\nThe memory of him saying \"how about I tie a pole to your back next time?\" with a smile, still made her shudder even until now.\nWhile she shuddering after recalling that memory, Felix proposed smilingly.\n\"In that case, Dudley should practice being an escort and Miss Norton should practice getting used to being escorted. Cyril, can you teach him how to be an escort?\"\n\"If Your Highness insists…\"\nCyril nodded grudgingly, then turned to face Glenn before saying with a raised eyebrow.\n\"Now, kid! I will teach you my escorting skills! First, you will escort me as if I were a girl!\"\n\"Well… treating you like a girl was… a bit hard…\"\n\"Stop being so picky!\"\nAs Cyril scolding and dragging Glenn away, Felix smiled at Monica.\n\"Since that is the case, please take care of me. Miss Norton.\"\n\"P-Please take care… of me, too.\"\nAs Monica bowed her head perpetually, Felix quickly reached out his hand to Monica.\n\"Grab my hand.\"\n\"………\"\nWithout taking a single step, Monica stretched her arm to its limit. Then, she touched Felix's outstretched hand with her fingertips.\nFelix looked down at her fingertips with a smile on his face.\n\"I guess you're surprisingly unwilling in being escorted, huh?\"\n\"No, I don't mean like that! I-I'm so sorry!\"\nFelix was smiling, but his eyes were not.\nShakily, Monica took a half step forward. Then Felix quickly grabbed Monica's hand and pulled her toward him.\nFelix's hands were supporting her body, and the moment she thought about that, Monica's body tensed up.\n\"You know, when you were with Cyril, you were a little more docile in being escorted.\"\n\"T-That's… because at that time, Lord Ashley was different from usual, I was so surprised, so…\"\nAt that time, she was too stunned by Cyril's conduct when dancing, and the dance had started and ended before she realized it. But now, the situation was different.\nAs Monica stiffened, Felix looked up and instructed Lana.\n\"Excuse me. Can you play some music for me? With a slightly lower volume.\"\n\"Yes, sir!\"\nLana nodded excitedly and began to play the piano. As the music played a little more subduedly than before, Felix took Monica's hand to lead the way. It was the same as with Cyril. Even without the call of a \"one-two-three\" signal, she could somehow understand when to start, probably because Felix was also great at escorting.\n\"You don't have to pay attention to your steps right now. Maybe you could forget about your dancing altogether.\"\n\"…Eh?\"\n\"You could walk around at your pace while having fun chatting with me. Your body easily stiffens, after all.\"\nThe idea of having a nice chat with someone really threw Monica off. Monica was not very good at talking, and she was not very good at bringing up topics of conversation to anyone. Since she never had a chance to make a casual conversation.\nWhen Monica frightened and clammed up, and Felix smiled at her.\n\"I've never seen your eyes up close before. They look light brown, but when exposed to light, they seem to have a slight greenish tinge… They look like the trees deep in the forest illuminated by the sun, doesn't it?\"\n\"Um… Er…\"\n\"Your light brown hair is also very shiny and beautiful. Did you have a friend braid it for you today?\"\n\"Y-Yes. Um, Miss Lana Collette is very good at this kind of thing.\"\n\"Yeah… it looks really good on you.\"\nWhen someone complimented her hair, she was happy because it was like a compliment for Lana.\nMonica giggled, her cheeks relaxing.\n\"…Eheehee… Thank you… very much…\"\n\"Hmm, so you can even smile like that. Hey, can you show me more?\"\nBeing stared at so closely, Monica felt embarrassed and lowered her eyes. Then the scarf on Felix's lapel caught her eye.\nI think Lana had mentioned something about the embroidery, and it was indeed quite intricate. If one looks at it from a distance, it's not that spectacular, but when one looked closer, it looks more luxurious and intricates.\nMonica loved to look at the beautiful patterns.\nIf I look at the pattern of this vine rose… I could think of it as a circle, and since four circles are inscribed in another larger circle, with that particular set of principles… along with the distance between roses…\n\"I think a green dress would look good on you. Something a little deeper, but not too dark. Maybe a beautiful flower embroidery on the skirt would be nice. Do you have a favorite flower?\"\nTwo circles that do not intersect each other have two common tangents. And each of them has the same distance… with that assumption… It can be applied in multiple magic formulas with a wide range of magic coordinates.\n\"Ah, autumn roses look good, too. It's smaller and more elegant than the large roses that bloom in summer. I think its calming color would suit you better.\"\nThe radius of the four circles is infinitesimal and the length of the tangent line has an equal distance between them… but considering the development of the scope of the wide-area magic formula…\nThe music stopped.\nAs Felix stopped his steps still supporting Monica's body, Neil, who had been watching the scene, clapped.\n\"Amazing! From halfway through, the dance became a proper dance! And Miss Norton's movements were more relax and less tense… It's the best dance I've ever seen!\"\n\"Miss Norton was doing her best to learn the steps with her feet, but her movements tended to be stiff and her tempo slipped because she was thinking too hard.\"\nFelix said, looking into Monica's face with a smile.\n\"I guess enjoying a good chat had allowed them to move on their own devices without thinking about any unnecessary things, is that right?\"\nUpon being spoken to, Monica raised her head and looked around as if she had just woken up from a dream.\n\"Ah… Um… Er…\"\n\"Monica! Monica! You were dancing so well just now!\"\nGlenn, who had been watching Monica's dance from halfway through, praised her with a sparkle in his eyes, and Cyril nodded his head in agreement, saying, \"As expected of His Highness, his escorts was the best!\"\nMonica held both cheeks, like still fluttering in her dream.\n\"… I was able… to dance?\"\n\"Yeah, you danced very well.\"\nAt Felix nod, Monica's face lit up.\nShe had a big smile on her face, something that Monica rarely shows, as she usually keeps her head down and squirms.\n\"I… I just realized, the pattern on Your Highness's scarf could be replaced with a different set of patterns! And this set of patterns is very beautiful and applicable in many ways. Just thinking about how to apply this helped me stop thinking about unnecessary stuff!\"\nA heavy silence filled the dance room.\nLike an innocent child, only Monica was the one who has sparkles in her eyes.\nThen, a kindhearted Neil interrupted her fearfully.\n\"Um… I think, in a roundabout way, that kind of thinking was the epitome you were thinking of unnecessary things…\"\n\"…ah.\"\nMonica's smile stiffened as she slowly, slowly glanced over at Felix.\nFelix was still smiling. Albeit, his blue eyes shone darkly.\n\"Was our little chat kind of unnecessary things for you, Miss Norton?\"\n\"Um, er, well, I mean, it just…\"\nMonica paled quickly, clenched her fists, before shouting.\n\"The only reason I was able to dance so well was thanks to Your Highness's scarf!\"\n\"You should have said, ‘Thanks to Your Highness!' here\"\nCyril's angry voice echoed through the dance room.\nThus, Monica learned how to perform a dance without getting nervous by immersing herself in her thoughts.\nIt should be noted that the pattern on Felix's scarf, which Monica had been gazing at intently, was accurately drawn before it shown to Lana, who was greatly appreciative of the result.",

      "content": "There are several tea rooms provided in the Serendia Academy. Among them, there's a private tea room that only a few special students can use, which was now used as a location for today's tea party.\nThe event was hosted by Bridget Graham, the daughter of Marquis Sheilbury, the secretary of the student council.\nAnd there was only one guest who was invited. He was the student council president and also the second prince of the Kingdom of Ridill, Felix Ark Ridill.\n\"I heard Miss Monica Norton has passed her ballroom dance re-examination.\"\nAfter announcing that in a casual tone, Felix took a sip of the tea that had been prepared.\nBridget, who was also elegantly sipping her tea, took the cup off her mouth before putting it back on the saucer.\n\"That's good to hear.\"\n\"I thought you wanted Miss Norton to be failed. So I had assumed that you would be happy to denounce her if she was failed.\"\n\"Why would I be happy if there's a failed member in our student council?\"\nA truly exemplary answer.\nBridget, one of the three most beautiful girls in the school, looked at Felix inquiringly, wearing a thin smile on her beautiful face.\n\"Speaking of ballroom dancing… it brings back memories. Do you still remember practicing ballroom dancing with me when we were a child?\"\n\"And you've been an outstanding person since that time.\"\n\"I remember that Your Highness was not very good at practicing dancing… and kept apologizing for stepping on my feet.\"\nBridget covered her mouth with her fan, peering her eyes at Felix… It was as if she was trying to ascertain his reaction.\nFelix gave her an embarrassed look as if he was ashamed of his poor performance in the past.\n\"Suddenly you're talking about the past. What's the matter? It's rare for you to bring up this topic.\"\n\"There are times when I reminisce of the good old memories.\"\nHowever, while the two seemed to be enjoying their conversation, a silent battle was taking place under the surface.\nBridget Graham was a brilliant girl. She's never dazzled by Felix's good looks and status, a woman who could not be swayed easily… ever since long ago.\n\"I knew you were always a clever girl.\"\n\"My father's not too happy about it. He said women are better when they're a little dumb and lovable… do you think so, Your Highness?\"\n\"I\ndo\nprefer clever women.\"\n\"My, I am flattered.\"\nHo-ho-ho, Brigitte laughed with a beautiful smile that everyone could admire, but her golden eyes remained cold.\nThe insincere compliments of Felix would never reach the heart of that clever girl.\n\"By the way, does Miss Monica Norton fall into the category of a ‘smart woman' for you, Your Highness?\"\n\"What do you think?\"\nBridget attacked and Felix dodged her with a smile.\nWhen Felix smiled at her, as if to say, \"I'd love to hear your clever thoughts,\" Bridget lowered her long eyelashes and chose her words.\n\"As far as I'm concerned, she's a scholar at heart. If she is given the proper equipment, she would have produced outstanding results, but negotiating in public could be her weak point. If Your Highness wanted to evaluate her, there were other ways to do it without making her an officer of the student council, weren't there?\"\nIndeed, the girl in from of him was a clever woman.\nIn these situations, Bridget was able to see things logically rather than emotionally, objectively rather than subjectively.\nOn top of that, Bridget was implying that Monica Norton was unfit to be a student council member.\nHer point was valid. Monica Norton would be an inadequate person to represent the students. Aside from her paperwork skills, her conduct was too disappointing.\nFelix lifted the edge of his mouth slightly, narrowing his blue eyes slowly.\n\"When you look at her, do you ever think like… ‘Why am I unable to do that?'\"\nBrigitte neither agreed nor denied but simply watched in silence, trying to figure out Felix's true intentions.\nAnd Felix gave her a friendly smile.\n\"You must have thought it was as if you were looking at the old me, Bridget.\"\nEven after her name was called in a friendly manner, Bridget did not lose her fixed smile.\nFelix then put the cup back in the saucer and stood up.\nIt was still early, but spending his time with her this much should be enough.\n\"Thank you for the tea. I enjoyed our time together, Miss Graham.\"\n\"Yes, it's my pleasure… I really have to thank you for sparing your valuable time with me, Your Highness.\"\nBridget, who always smiling thoroughly, was an example of perfect young lady who was faultless in every way.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAfter leaving the tea room, Felix walked away, sighing.\n…She's still a stubborn young lady as always.\nHe might have spoken a little too much.\nReflecting, Felix casually glanced out the window before widening his eyes.\nWhat is that…\nHe's looking at Glenn who was working on something behind the school building. There's also Monica, Neil, and Lana who seemed to be helping Glenn.\nAs he wondered what they were doing, Glenn set up a stone and placed an iron net on top of it. He lit a fire under the net and began to lay down the meat on the net.\nWah…\nFelix who had intended to return to the dormitory halted and headed quickly for the backyard.",

      "content": "To celebrate their success passing the dance re-examination, Glenn suggested everyone to organizing a party.\n\"I'll take care of the place and the food!\" Glenn thumped his chest. Lana and Neil thought it was going to be a tea party but the event was held in the backyard, with lots of meat prepared. Even without telling them, they all know how this will go.\n\"As I thought, grilling meat was the best way to celebrate!\" said Glenn as he quickly set up the stone and iron grill before starting to grill the meat.\nLana was more engrossed in this than expected. As the daughter of a wealthy merchant, she curiously watched Glenn grilling the meat. If Lana didn't stop Glenn, Neil, and Monica, who were easily influenced, would simply watch in silence.\n\"I guess these things are easier to make than I thought.\"\n\"I somehow manage it with whatever I have on hand. Although portable grill has good performance these days, they are a bit expensive for personal use.\"\nThe meat was browning on the grill dripping with juice.\nThe juice dripping under the steel mesh crackled as the fire grew stronger. Lana let out a small squeal of surprise, but Glenn flipped the meat as if he was used to it.\n\"I think it looks pretty good.\"\nAfter adjusting the heat by moving the wood, Glenn distributed the skewered meat to Monica, Lana, and Neil. He then picked up a skewered meat for himself before holding it up.\n\"Okay, since everyone already got your own portions… so to celebrate passing the re-examination for me and Monica… Let's eat!\"\nWith that, Glenn opened his big mouth and took a bite of the meat.\nLana was used to it, but Monica and Neil chewed their meat in a perplexed manner.\nThe browned lamb had a slight odor, but the spices made it taste good. Even Monica, who is not a fan of strong-smelling food, found it to be delicious.\n\"I… I'm not good with lamb meat… but, I think this is very good.\"\nMonica voiced her thoughts in a whisper, and Glenn snorted proudly.\n\"Hmmm… It was thanks to the secret spice of my Dudley family. You could buy it in our stores, so please come visit us!\"\nAfter hearing Glenn done his advertising with a strong commercial spirit, Neil then gave his honest opinion.\n\"In these days, obtaining spices have become easier in some areas. As my parents live in the mountains, we still having trouble getting some of it. So, instead of using spice, we tend to use herbs to remove the smell.\"\n\"I also know a lot about herbs,\" Neil said coquettishly, and Lana stopped eating the skewers then added.\n\"From what I heard from my Father the amount trading has increased after Southerndoll expanded their second and third ports. Also, since their emperor empire in the east has been replaced, many turmoils have happened while merchants are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Some of them are staying in this kingdom's ports near the empire.\"\n\"Depending on the new policies they created, there is a possibility of merchants flowing to the empire at once. I've heard that the current emperor has innovated a lot of policies.\"\nAs Monica listened to Lana and Neil's conversation, she thought absentmindedly.\nSince the empire lifted the ban on medical magic, many magicians have been flowing to the empire. Similarly, it won't be long before merchants will also flow to the Empire. Where people gather, commerce is born. And the empire surely will grow even more in the future.\nOn the other hand, in the Kingdom of Ridill, a conflict has arisen between the central nobles who desperately want to maintain the old system and the local nobles. Furthermore, the factions have been divided into the First, Second, and Third Prince factions.\nThe king sometimes mediated the conflict between the nobles, but for the most part, he remained silent.\nThat sort of power struggle… I dislike it.\nAs one of the Seven Sages, Monica has been granted the right to meet and speak directly with the king.\nThe Seven Sages sometimes serve as advisors to the king. In other words, Monica can be directly involved in politics. However, Monica has no interest in power or the future being of the country. The reason why she became one of the Seven Sages was because of the recommendation of those around her.\nWhat Louis wants me to do, I wonder…\nIf he wanted to guard the second prince, he should have chosen someone better suited for the job.\nAnd yet, the fact that he sent such a poorly qualified Monica as his bodyguard leads her to the worst possibility.\nDon't tell me… by sending me, a useless person, to the second prince, he had planned to make him fall into his destruction.\nWhat made Louis Miller was frightening was because that kind of\"possibility\" could happen.\nAs Monica shivered, remembering Louis' wicked smile, Glenn glanced at Monica's face.\n\"Monica, your hand has stopped eating! You are too small, you need to eat more!\"\n\"Ah, I'm sorry…\"\nMonica's hands were sticky with the juice from the meat because she had been absentmindedly holding the skewers vertically. She hurriedly wiped it off with a handkerchief, then Lana exasperatedly said…\n\"Hold the skewer horizontally. If you hold it vertically, the juice will drip down on your hand.\"\n\"I-I will… You seem pretty knowledgeable about it, Lana…\"\n\"My hometown often organizing many festivals, so the culture of eating and drinking is rather well established. Well, many people who grew up in the capital are not like that, though.\"\nMonica, who had grown up in the capital, was shocked. And she was not accustomed to the culture of eating outside.\nWhat if she were going to ask me further about that,\nMonica worried inwardly, but Lana didn't pry any further, only looked at the skewer seriously before muttering…\n\"I've found many roasted chestnuts and fruit stalls around the capital, but not for grilled meat. I think it would be very popular if we set up such stalls here… but the regulations here were very strict, so I don't think it would easy to open some store or stall or something…\"\nMonica just recently realized that Lana was not only knowledgeable about popular things but also has a strong business spirit.\nSuch an unexpected side of a person cannot be easily understood until you talk to them in person.\nIn the past, when she was attending the magician training institute, Minerva, Monica refused to socialize or to get to know other people. She even thought that such things were \"useless\".\nBack then, she had never imagined that the day would come when she would secretly grill meat in the backyard like this and eat it with someone else.\nAlthough Lana has a lot of pride, she actually cares for others. She also has a penchant for trendy things.\nGlenn was a little too free-spirited, but he's surprisingly observant and caring, despite his clumsiness.\nNeil was easily influenced, but he was a kind person who would do everything he could to help when asked.\nThe meat tastes delicious.\nMonica's mouth broke into a smile and she nibbled on the meat with happiness.\nHaving finished the meat twice as fast as Monica, Glenn then happily began to grill the next batch of meat.\nSeeing this, Neil exclaimed, \"You're still going to eat?\" while widening his eyes.\n\"I haven't eaten enough!\"\n\"I think I've had my fill!\"\nAs Neil held his stomach, Glenn sniffed with excitement.\n\"You need to eat more to grow!\"\n\"I had a feeling you did just call me short? You did, didn't you?\"\nGlenn finched after being pressed with a blank expression by Nell. Another new side of him was revealed.\nLooking at their exchange, Monica and Lana were laughing…\n\"Hey, you look like you're having fun.\"\nEveryone held their tongue and looked back at the voice.\nStanding there unaccompanied was the student council president, Felix Ark Ridill.\nNeil's face paled quickly.\n\"Um, President, you know, we're just…\"\n\"Geez… brazenly violating school rules, with two two student council members at that.\"\nWhen Felix let out a lamenting sigh, Glenn bravely held up a skewer and countered.\n\"There's no school rule that says you can't grill meat in the back of the school building!\"\n\"According to Chapter 3 of the school rules, it is prohibited to cause disturbance to the scenery of the school building.\"\n\"What does it mean to cause disturbance to the scenery?\"\nIgnoring Glenn's question, Felix added with a smile.\n\"Also, if you're going to create a fire outside of the designated areas, you need to apply a permit to the student council.\"\n\"Then, since you, the president, is here, I guess there's no problem! President! Please grant us permission!\"\nIt was refreshing to see how he kept his own pace.\nAs everyone looking around in suspense, Felix folded his arms fixing his gaze on Glenn.\n\"You're supposed to apply for those things with proper forms at least one day in advance.\"\n\"Is that so? Oh, would you like one too, President?\"\nWith a fluid gesture, Glenn offered Felix a skewered meat.\nHow fearless!\nWhile Neil and Monica gasped, Felix stared at the skewered meat, and…\n\"Yeah, I think I'll have some.\"\n…picked up that skewer.\n\"You are going to eat it?\" Neil screamed in a small voice. Monica seconded.\nMonica had thought Felix would throw the meat away in front of Glenn, but contrary to her expectations, Felix dexterously took a bite of the meat on the skewer. Unlike Monica, he didn't hold the skewer vertically letting the juice drip on his hands.\n\"Yep, it's delicious. I like the way it's spiced up.\"\nAfter finishing the meat on the skewer, Felix looked at Neil and Monica, who were stunned, and gave them a wink.\n\"Now I'm an accomplice. Will you keep quiet about this?\"\nNeil and Monica nodded furiously in silence.\nGlenn smiled pleasantly.\n\"There's still more, so feel free to have some! I'd also like to thank you for helping me dance! …oh, by the way, do you want to invite the vice president too?\"\n\"\"Don't do that, please!\"\"\nMonica and Neil shouted in unison.\nIf Cyril Ashley, a very sensitive and nerve-racking person, were to see this situation, he would obviously yell at them with bloodshot eyes.\nIn order to prevent the smell of grilling meat and smoke from flowing into the school building, Monica secretly adjusted the direction of the wind with her no-chant magic.\nFor now, she wanted to spend this happy time undisturbed.",

      "content": "Serendia Academy has several unique curriculums for nobles that were not found in general schools.\nOne such class was the \"tea ceremony\" course, which was only attended by girls.\nFor ladies belonging to the nobility, a tea party was not just a time for pleasant conversation. It's also a social occasion where one's dignity was tested by how well one entertains or is entertained by guests.\nIn the tea ceremony course, the students were thoroughly drilled on the etiquette there before performing the practical lessons.\nThe practical lessons were held in the courtyard in the form of a tea party.\nFour or five girls of the same grade would form a group and sit at one table. Each student would bring a cup of tea to share with the other students, who would then evaluate the tea.\nHowever, since the teacher would set specific sweets in advance, students were demanded to serve the tea to match it, in other words, the course was starting from when they begin to prepare it.\nIn the tea ceremony course, they had been assigned to prepare their own tea leaves, but they usually have their servants buy it for them in most cases.\nHowever, Monica had no idea where to even buy one, so after much worrying, she decided to turn to the self-proclaimed villainess, Miss Isabelle Norton.\nOnce Monica went to Isabelle's room, Isabelle happily offered Monica a seat and prepared tea and sweets for her.\nWhen Monica explained the situation while munching on a cookie with plenty of sugar sprinkled around it, Isabelle nodded her head and patted her chest confidently. Her gesture was quite vigorous which unbefitting that of a young lady.\n\"If that's the case, please leave it to me, Big Sister Monica! I'll do my best to help you get through the class safely!\"\n\"T-Thank you very much…\"\nAs Monica bowing her head, Isabelle's maidservant, Agatha, interrupted her as she poured tea into her cup.\n\"If that's the case, please allow me to teach you how to make tea. Actually, it would be better if I could go to your place and teach you directly, but… that would contradict the setting where Lady Monica is being tormented by the Kerbeck family.\"\nStudents were allowed to brew their own tea or have a servant brew it for them in the course. However, it's common practice to have a servant prepare the tea for them in most cases. Those who make their own tea were looked down upon as third-rate nobles who can't bring their own servants.\nBut in Monica's case, she was supposed to be tormented by the daughter of Count Kerbeck, so it would be unnatural if Isabelle's maidservant went directly to help her.\n\"P-Please give me some guidance…\"\nMonica bowed deeply to Agatha, which then she said, \"It's okay, just lift your head!\" to stop her bow with a laugh.\nIsabelle, as well as Agatha, was a very thoughtful young lady and maidservant. Though they were a bit hard to get close to when they were acting like the villainess.\n\"In that case, what kind of tea would you like to serve, Big Sister Monica? Do they set any specific type of confections?\"\n\"Y-Yes… I-It's butter cake.\"\nIsabelle nodded her head and put her fingers on her chin, thinking about something.\nChoosing the right tea to match with the confections was also part of the lessons. However, Monica was not used to eating tea or confections. She was more used to drinking coffee because of her father's influence.\n\"Um… do you have any suggestion about tea that would match the butter cake?\"\n\"If it just a simple cake with butter, most basic teas will work well. It may be better to enjoy the cake with a slightly astringent or savory flavor rather than a light one. Milk tea is also not a bad idea, but… let me tell you, Big Sister Monica…\"\nIsabel trailed off and looked at Monica with a serious face then said firmly.\n\"The combination of tea and confections is a matter of personal preference, and there is no definite right answer. However… some combinations will definitely end up with the wrong answer!\"\nWhat does it mean that there is no right answer but some will end up with the wrong answer?\nAs Monica was confused, Isabelle spoke up.\n\"That… was to serve the same thing on the same table…\"\n\"Ah…\"\nThe practice lesson was held in groups of several people, and each person brought their own tea. It's certainly not a good idea to have the same kind of tea served at the same table.\n\"It is especially bad if you served the same thing as someone who is in a higher position than you. Strictly speaking, the dress, hairstyle, and accessories that you wear to the tea party should be trendy but different, so you should put some thought into it… But since you will wear uniform in the lesson, let's just think about the tea leaves for now!\"\nI had to think even that…?\nthought Monica in a shudder.\nAs a Seven Sages, the only gathering Monica attended was the Conference of the Seven Sages, which was held only for the Seven Sages, and the dress code was basically robed, so she only had to wear the robes provided by the kingdom. Granted, Monica had never worried about her attire at social gatherings.\nThis tea party for aristocratic ladies was likely more nerve-wracking than Monica had imagined.\n\"The best way to do it was to investigate the people in your group before thinking about the tea you will serve at the lessons… So, how many people are in your group, Big Sister Monica?\"\n\"Um… Including me, there are four people… one of them is from my class… She is Miss Lana Collete… as for the other two… they are from the other class… so I don't know them very well…\"\nDuring joint practice with other classes, they will be assigned to form groups with those who were close to them.\nHowever, Monica's unsociable trait made it impossible for her to talk to anyone other than Lana. As for Lana herself treated as a bit of an outsider in the class, she has no other girls she was close to.\nAs a result, they were put in the same group as the remaining students by the teacher.\nOne of them was Casey, a brown-haired young lady with a vivacious air.\nWhile the other was Claudia, a calm, dark-haired beauty.\nAfter a brief greeting on the first day, the meeting was dismissed and they hardly had a chance to talk.\n\"Then, deciding the tea in advance would prove more difficult.\"\n\"S-Sorry…\"\nLana would probably be able to provide her the details, but Monica didn't have any courage to directly ask the two girls, whom she barely knew.\nFurthermore, she didn't know their family ranks of the two girls, so if Monica were to speak to them, she might be perceived as being unpolite. Among the nobility, a person of a lower rank to casually talk to a person of a higher rank was taboo.\n\"In that case, I will provide you with several kinds of tea. At a tea party, those with the highest status are served first, so it's likely you would be served in last. That way, you can easily make sure that your choice of tea won't clash with anyone.\"\n\"T-Thank you very much…\"\nMonica bowed her head, slumping her shoulders then let out a deep sigh.\n\"This tea party thing is so hard, isn't it…\"\nWhen Monica looked unsure of herself, Isabelle also let out a sigh with a troubled face.\n\"I wish my knowledge would be useful to you… I apologize for my inexperience… but If you wanted to learn how to act like a villainess, I could teach you all you need to know!\"\n\"I-I'm fine…\"\nEven if it is passed down to her, she will never have the chance to use it. Absolutely not.\nMonica gave a wry smile, and Agatha, Isabelle's maidservant, advised her with a very serious face.\n\"My Lady, there may be an occasion in the future when Miss Monica will have to face a villainess other than you. For that occasion, how about teaching her about the behavior of a villainess now?\"\n\"…eh?\"\nAs Monica was twitching with a stiff expression, Isabelle's put her hands on her face, saying \"Wonderful!\"\n\"Yes, that's a good idea! Big Sister Monica is my heroine! I'm sure there will come a time when some other villainess will invite her to tea parties and tormented her!\"\nShe sincerely wished to spare herself from such a future. As much as she desired it, she knew she could not say it in her current situation.\nAfter all, having been elected to the student council as soon as she transferred to the school, and having her dance rehearsals watched by the same student council members, Monica has made enemies with the majority of the female students. The only people in her grade who would treat her normally were Lana, Glenn, and Neil.\nNow, the eyes of the people around Monica can be generally divided into two types.\nThose who despise Monica and show hostility towards her, and those who look at her from afar as some kind of uncanny person.\nNo one has called her out to the back of the school building or hidden her personal belongings yet, but many times she has been sarcastically remarked on as she passes by or giggled at from afar.\n\"Now. I will explain to you the behavioral patterns of villainesses, in case you come face to face with a true villainess someday.\"\nThey say that the first step to fight your enemy is to understand your enemy.\nKnowing what would a villainess do here, might come in handy one day.\nif possible, I really don't want that day to come…\nAs Monica straightened her back to listen intently to Isabelle's speech—in an instant.\n\"Ohohoho!\"\nIsabelle put her hand over her mouth, puffed her chest out, and smiled loftily.\nHearing her voice, Monica's shoulders jerked, and Isabelle pulled back her high-pitched laugh and straightened her posture.\n\"First of all, this is the basic move of a villainess. A high-pitched laugh. By laughing like this, you can intimidate and check your opponent, and at the same time, you can regain control of the situation!\"\n\"C-Can a high-pitched laugh have such an effect?\"\nTo Monica's great surprise, Isabelle nodded plausibly.\n\"However, if you use it too often, the effect will fade, so use it only with the right timing.\"\nRight, the timing of using special moves is important, apparently.\nAs Monica was nodding her head, Isabelle unfolded her fan in front of her.\n\"And basic move number two! ‘Snicker silently'!\"\nIn a fluid motion, Isabelle held the fan to her mouth to show the other person that she was laughing at them as if she were making fun of them.\nNo matter how you look at it, her haughty laughter, which showed how much she looked down on the other person, will put shame on an actress's performance on a stage.\n\"Normally, covering your mouth with a fan when laughing is proper etiquette, but in this case, I deliberately lowered the fan a little to show my mouth to the other person. By doing so, I could blatantly show that I am mocking the other person!\"\nHow detailed, Monica thought in shock.\nShe never thought such minor details would have such effects!\n\"Of course, you can also hide your mouth with a fan and giggle to create a sarcastic effect. You should use different methods according to the character of the young lady.\"\n\"I-I see… t-this is so profound.\"\n\"Yes, the more I try to master it, the more I realize how deep it goes.\"\nJust to make sure, they're talking about villainess.\nThus, the villainess course, which was far more intensive than the tea brewing course, continued until late at night.\nIt should be added here that Miss Isabelle Norton was the top student in the tea party course of the first year of high school.",

      "content": "The joint tea ceremonies practical lesson involving the second year of high school was held in the form of a tea party with several tables set up in the courtyard.\nIn this tea party, the guests to be served tea in the tea party were lounging on the first floor of the school building.\nFor those who have servants, the servants will brew the tea here, but in Monica's case, she has to brew it herself.\nSince Monica would be the last one to serve tea, she had to leave in the middle of the tea ceremony and brew tea in this preparation room, but she couldn't carry a can of tea leaves to the tea ceremony. So, she decided to bring the cans into the preparation room instead.\nIn the preparation room, a number of servants were already preparing the tea. Almost no one was wearing a uniform.\nMonica awkwardly sneaked into the preparation room and looked for a place to put the can of tea leaves.\nUm, somewhere where I won't get mixed up with other people's stuff…\nAs she was scurrying around the preparation room, someone tapped Monica on the shoulder.\n\"Hey.\"\n\"Y-Y-Yeeessh…?\"\nWhen Monica turned around with a jittery look on her face, one of the girls was looking at Monica with a slightly surprised look. Perhaps she was surprised by Monica's exaggerated reaction.\nThe person who tapped Monica on the shoulder was a lively girl with light brown hair. Her face was somewhat familiar to Monica.\nI think she is…\nAs Monica struggled to remember her name, the brown-haired girl's face lit up when she saw Monica's face.\n\"Oh, I knew it! You must be Miss Monica Norton from the next class. I'm Casey Groove. We're in the same group today. Do you remember me?\"\nActually, Monica couldn't remember her name very well, but she nodded her head.\n\"P-Please take care of me today, Lady Groove.\"\n\"You don't have to be so formal about it. Just call me Casey. Do you mind if I call you Monica too?\"\nAs Monica blushed and nodded, Casey said, \"Thanks!\" Smiled pleasantly, flashing her white teeth.\nCompared to the other young ladies, she was much frank and easy-going.\nCasey turned her attention to the can of tea in Monica's arms.\n\"Did you come to drop off your cans, too? Me too.\"\nCasey lightly shook the light blue can in her hand. She could hear the tea leaves rustling in the can.\n\"I guess everyone sends their servants to make tea for them, after all. My family is a poor noble family in the countryside, so I didn't bring any servants with me.\"\nIndeed, Casey had no makeup and her hair was simply tied up in a bun. Her scarf and gloves were also simple and unadorned. She looked almost the same as Monica.\nShe may not be incredibly beautiful, but she has a charming personality. She has a lively smile unlike a young lady, which was pleasing to the eye.\nCasey put the can of tea leaves on the shelf and put a piece of paper with her name written underneath. That way, she wouldn't have to worry about her stuff being mistaken for someone else's.\n\"Do you want some, Monica? I still have some extra paper.\"\n\"T-Thank you…\"\nMonica took the paper hesitantly, thought about it for a moment, and then folded the edges of the paper several times to make a bellows-like crease.\nThis way, even without writing the name as Casey did, the distinctive fold at the edge of the paper would serve as a marker.\nMonica placed a piece of paper with the edges folded underneath and placed three tea cans on top of it. This way, no one would mistake her thing for someone else's.\n\"Did you prepare three kinds of tea leaves?\"\nWhen Casey looked at Monica's can, she widened her eyes.\nMonica fidgeted her fingers then she answered.\n\"I-I just didn't want my choice to overlap with anyone else.\"\nCasey clapped her hands in admiration at Monica's answer.\n\"Oh, I see… I didn't realize there was such a possibility. Oh no, I hadn't even thought about what would happen if my choice overlap. You're so smart.\"\n\"I-I'm not…\"\nIt was Miss Isabelle who gave her the idea of what to do when her choice was overlapped.\nWhile thanking Miss Isabelle inwardly once again, Monica asked her the thing that had been bothering her.\n\"Oh, um, I think there's another person in our group…\"\n\"Do you mean Miss Claudia?\"\n\"Y-Yes. Do you know what kind of tea did she prepare?\"\nShe had confirmed Lana's tea in advance. She was also able to confirm what Casey prepared at this moment.\nThat left only one person remaining. It was the black-haired Miss Claudia.\nSince Claudia was in the same class as Casey, Monica asked her in the hope to know what kind of tea Claudia prepared, but… Casey shook her head dejectedly.\n\"Well, I'm sorry. She never talks at all in class. So I have no idea what's she thinking.\"\nTrailing off there, Casey furrowed her brow and muttered bitterly.\n\"I mean, there is no one in our class who had ever talked to her before.\"\n\"…?\"\nUnsure of the meaning of Casey's words, Monica looked worried, but Casey smiled encouragingly at her.\n\"Well, let's do our best today!\"\n\"Y-Yes… p-please take care of me…\"\nCasey was easy to talk to, a friendly young lady, she might even be a good friend to Lana.\nAnd yet, she felt strangely anxious about the tea party she was about to attend.\nWhat kind of person is Miss Claudia?\nD-Don't tell me… S-She's like Miss Isabelle said… a villainous daughter…!?\nWhile wondering what would happen if she gave her a high-pitched laugh when they met.\nAnyway, I have to face it with a strong heart…\nthought Monica while gulped in secret.",

      "content": "Under a pleasant autumn sky, a gorgeous tea party was being held in the courtyard.\nEven though it was a practical lesson, Serendia Academy has met up its expectation as a prestigious academy. The table arrangements were top-notch, and each table was decorated with beautiful flowers, an assortment that could be compared to a tea party at the royal palace. If it weren't for the students in their uniforms, she might have thought it was a hall in a royal palace.\nThe girls were happily talking to each other while savoring the tea they had brought.\nWhen the teacher came to do grading, the girls would start to discuss tea, tea utensils, and seasonal flowers, but once the teacher left the table, the topic would change to recent fads and gossip about their love life.\nParticularly, the topic they brought up in their discussions was mostly thing related to the student council president, Felix Ark Ridill.\n\"I'm sure His Highness will choose his fiance during his studies.\"\n\"Who would be the most suitable, I wonder.\"\n\"I've heard he's very close to Lady Eliane.\"\n\"I think Lady Bridget, who is also a member of the student council, would be a perfect match for him.\"\nThe names they gave for the second prince's potential fiance were all daughters who were at the top of this school.\nAnd yet, somewhere in the back of their minds, they were fantasizing about being chosen as the prince's fiance.\nIt's something that every female student at this school dreams about at least once. How wonderful it would be if that beautiful face smiled at them, or if he reaches his hand out to them!\nWhile these girls fantasizing about that, they would also satisfy their pride by citing and looking down on the most unworthy girl for their prince.\n\"Right, speaking of the same student council members… did you hear about that girl?\"\nWhen one of the daughters spoke in the lowered voice behind her fan, the other daughters' eyes naturally turned stern.\nThat girl—the girl who was elected to the student council despite being a transfer student. Monica Norton.\n\"I've heard that His Highness has been giving her some dance lessons.\"\n\"I saw her too! I heard she was dancing with Lord Ashley!\"\n\"Who does she think she is, asking His Highness and Lord Ashley to teach her how to dance?\"\n\"She must have been some conceited country girl who forced His Highness to help her.\"\n\"That girl doesn't even have a servant to make her tea. Does she not have any shame?\"\n\"Just watch her. I'm sure she'll embarrass herself in this class.\"\nHiding their malice under their beautiful fans, those young ladies giggled at each other.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThe table where Monica was seated was filled with an odd atmosphere.\nRather, one girl was creating that odd atmosphere. The culprit, surprisingly, was not Monica. It also was not Lana and Casey.\nIt was Miss Claudia, the most high-ranking person in the group.\nClaudia was a very beautiful girl.\nShe had straight black hair and beautiful eyes that looked like they were made of lapis lazuli. Her face looked like a masterpiece that God had painstakingly created, and her beauty was no less than that of the student council secretary, Miss Bridget.\nIf Bridget, with her golden hair and amber eyes, has a beauty that of a gorgeous, large-flowered rose, then Claudia was an iris flower of mystical beauty.\nSuch a stunningly beautiful young lady somehow had a gloomy air about her, as if her relatives had died.\nEventually, Claudia's maidservant handed out enough tea for everyone, and Claudia said with an eerie smile on her pale, lifeless face.\n\"…Please. Help. Yourself.\"\nShe smiled like a wicked witch offering poisoned tea to a good person who knows nothing about it.\nBut the next moment, Claudia's face became expressionless as if a thread had been cut. Despite her expressionlessness, the gloom and lassitude that she conveyed were strangely palpable.\nMonica's worries about what would happen if someone laughed at her when they met were unfounded.\nIn the first place, this gloomy young lady has neither the energy nor the motivation to smile cheerfully. Her attitude was as if she found it too much trouble to even speak.\nThough Monica was said to be a gloomy girl, Claudia was nothing compared to her.\nIn Monica's case, it was due to her fear of strangers and inability to talk, but Claudia deliberately exuded a gloomy aura from her entire body that made it difficult to talk to her.\nThat's why the atmosphere at this table was heavy and gloomy.\nMonica, Lana, and Casey all drank the tea that was prepared for them in silence.\nThe tea had a nice aroma. However, due to the strange tension, she could barely taste it.\nUgh… this makes me feels uneasy…\n\"This tea is so good! Hey, which tea leaves do you use?\"\nThe heavy silence was cheerfully broken by Casey, a lively young lady from the next class.\nSensing the subtlety of the situation, Casey smiled and spoke to Claudia in an effort to keep the mood alive.\n\"…It's the most popular tea in the kingdom. I don't think you need to ask.\"\n\"………\"\nCasey's dimples tensed as she smiled.\nThis time, Lana said in a particularly cheerful voice.\n\"H-Hey, I actually like milk tea. Do you have any milk?\"\n\"…I'm not a fan of milk tea. Are you so stupid that you cannot understand that with your tongue?\"\n\"………\"\nLana's dimples tensed as she smiled.\nThe atmosphere in that place was getting worse and worse.\nMonica's lips quivered as she sipped her tea, which she could barely taste.\nThen, with an awkward air, Casey, who was second in order, excused herself to bring the tea she had brewed and distribute it to everyone.\nFollowing her was a brightly colored tea prepared by Lana, the third in order. It was refreshing and had a fruity sweetness and freshness to it.\n\"Miss Colette's tea is delicious. It feels refreshing. I like it.\"\nMonica nodded in agreement with Casey's words, and Lana put her cup in her saucer with a look of pride on her face.\n\"Well, I've ordered the finest tea of the season, of course.\"\nThen, Lana gave a glance at Claudia. It was probably a retort to Claudia, who had prepared a plain tea.\nThe strong-willed Lana did not like Claudia's attitude and had been poking at her for some time now.\nMonica could only watch on in flustered. Casey, the thoughtful one, somehow managed to keep the conversation going by appeasing Lana and changing the subject.\nIn the first place, the highest-ranking person is supposed to preside over such a tea party. Monica didn't know Claudia's identity, but judging from the order in charge of serving the tea, she was higher than Casey from the count's family and Lana from the baron's family.\nIn other words, Claudia should be the one to provide the topic and organize the whole situation.\nHowever, Claudia, who was the heart of the matter, was indifferent, and when she opened her mouth occasionally, all she did was spoke nastily. It's hard to have a conversation with her.\n\"…if it started with the strongest flavors tea, it will numb the tongue.\"\nSuddenly, Claudia blurted out.\nMonica remembered the taste of the tea that Claudia had prepared and surprised.\nA tea with a familiar flavor that doesn't have any strong traits… Did she offer it as the first one, so as not to numb the tongue?\nLana and Casey noticed the same thing and looked at Claudia with astonishment.\nHaving attracted so much attention, Claudia sipped the tea that Lana had prepared, looking as if she didn't care what she said.\n\"Flourendia's Golden Chips… This is the most valuable tea you can get this season.\"\n\"T-That's right.\"\nWhen Lana bickered with her, Claudia still did not look at Lana but lowered her eyelashes then muttered.\n\"If this had been an occasion to entertain a distinguished guest, it would have been the best choice… obviously inappropriate at this gathering, though.\"\n\"Wha—!?\"\n\"If only one person brings in an extremely valuable tea… the other participants might feel insulted.\"\nShaking and shivering, Lana's flushed red face turned pale.\nThen, Casey called out to Lana in a panic.\n\"D-Don't worry, I never think that way! Right, Monica?\"\n\"Yes, she's right… I also never think that way!\"\nAs Monica struggled to squeeze out her voice, Claudia slowly turned her head to look at Monica.\nHer doll-like blue eyes projected Monica's reflection without blinking.\n\"…If the daughter of the count says so, I have no choice but to agree..\"\n\"Fueh!?\"\nThe way she said it, it sounded as if Monica nodded because Casey had prompted her to.\nMonica half-cried, shaking her head.\n\"N-No… I-I just…\"\nAs Monica sobbed, Lana slammed the desk with her palm.\n\"Enough! Could you please stop with that attitude?! All you do when you open your mouth is sarcasm! The most inappropriate person at this table is you!\"\nEven though Lana shouted at her bravely, Claudia did not move an eyebrow. On the contrary, she looked away, as if Lana was not worth looking at.\n\"…You think you're worthy enough to make others speak to you.\"\n\"Hah!?\"\nAs Lana raised her eyebrows and glared at Claudia, Claudia paused for a few seconds and then opened her mouth languidly.\n\"…Have you ever heard of [Silent Witch]?\"\nOf course, she knew, that person herself was already in front of you.\nMonica's heart nearly stopped. Maybe it even stopped for a second.\n\"She is a genius magician who became the Seventh Sage at the tender age of fifteen. She had mastered the art of chantless magic, and in addition, had developed more than two dozen new magic formulas during her time at Minerva… however, she's famous for never having attended a conference.\"\nIt was because she was afraid of crowded places and had to run for her life.\n\"…furthermore, [Silent Witch] never uttered a single word during the ceremony when she was inaugurated as the Seven Sages.\"\nThis was due to her shyness and social anxiety issues as well.\nBecause Monica was so useless, her colleague Louis Miller, [Barrier Magician], took over all the greetings.\nWhile Monica was sweating coldly, remembering the past, Claudia continued her words without hesitation.\n\"…Have you ever read the article on [Silent Witch]? If you read it, you'll understand her personality… She's a very intelligent and wise person. I'm sure she knew the value of silence.\"\nI'm not intelligent or wise at all, I'm just a shy and gloomy person… I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry…!\nSitting beside Monica who had turned pale and was shaking uncontrollably, Lana glared at Claudia without hiding her displeasure.\n\"Oh, so you're saying that intelligent people don't talk to stupid people?\"\nHiiiek, no… you're wrong… I didn't mean it like that…!\nLana's remark was directed at Claudia, not at [Silent Witch], but Monica shrank back in fear.\nClaudia only glanced at Monica, as if she didn't even hear what Lana said.\n\"That reminds me, [Silent Witch]'s name is Monica Everett… just like you, Monica Norton.\"\nMonica cowered.\nThe sound of her heart was pounding loudly. Her unpleasant sweat kept flowing out.\nWith her eyes fixed on Monica, Claudia spoke up.\n\"You've been quiet for a while now because you don't want to talk to an idiot, do you?\"\n\"I-I-I-I will… e-excuse myself… to prepare the teeh…\"\nMonica stood up, got out of her seat to flee from that place.\nAnd Claudia's blue eyes kept staring at that small back of her.\nNo one noticed that since the beginning of this tea party, Claudia, who had always had a downcast look, had only looked at one person.",

She's noticed that I'm the Silent Witch…\nAfter becoming one of the Seven Sages, she had mostly kept her face hidden, so the only people who knew Monica's face were her fellow Seven Sages.\nOr perhaps they were acquaintances from her days at Minerva? But Monica, who was extremely socially awkward, was mostly confined herself inside the lab, and if she had seen a beautiful woman as conspicuous as Claudia somewhere, she would remember her for sure.\nI-It's just a coincidence… right…?\nIt just happened that she brought that topic up. It must be.\nTelling herself as much, Monica opened the door to enter the preparation room. Compared to before the tea ceremony has started, there were fewer people. Almost all the maids were probably out serving the guests at the tea ceremony.\nSlightly relieved by the least number of people, Monica turned to the shelf where she had placed her cans before.\n\"Huh…?\"\nLooking up at the shelf, Monica stiffened. Monica's can of tea leaves were missing.\nCasey's can of tea leaves was in the same position as Monica remembered. But the space next to it, where Monica had placed her cans, was empty.\nShe was certain, though, that she had laid out a folded paper and put three cans on top of it.\nFeeling a bad premonition, Monica's blood drained from her body.\nThis was not the first time Monica had been faced with this kind of situation. Just like what she had guessed.\nWith trembling hands, Monica lifted the lid of the trash can.\n\"…ah.\"\nMixed in with the used tea husks and empty cans, were unused tea leaves strewn all over in the trash. she also found her folded paper.\n\"How could my…\"\nMonica crouched down on the spot helplessly. Without the tea leaves, she would not be able to make tea. This means she can't continue her lesson.\nWhat should I do…?\nTears slowly welled up in her eyes. No matter how good a magician Monica might be, she can't rewind time.\nAs she swallowed a sob and sniffled, she heard a familiar voice behind her.\n\"What's wrong, Monica? Are you not feeling well?\"\nCasey kneeled down beside Monica and rubbed her back.\nWhen Monica asked her in a faint voice why she was here, Casey scratched her cheek with a complicated look.\n\"I was worried about you because you hadn't come back, so I came to check on you… guess not. Sorry, to be honest, it was hard for me to stay there…\"\nWell, she apparently couldn't stand the tense atmosphere between Lana and Claudia and slipped out of her seat under the pretense of going to check on Monica.\nCasey looked at the tea leaves strewn all over in the trash can and seemed to grasp the situation. She furrowed her brow and stared at the trash can.\n\"Horrible… who would do such things?\"\nCasey then wiped Monica's tears with a handkerchief and spoke to her in a gentle tone, as if she were a young child.\n\"Hey, do you have any spare tea leaves in the dorm? I think you could serve some tea you usually drink…\"\n\"I don't have any…\"\nSince Monica did not drink tea in general, she never stocked it up.\nIf she asked Miss Isabelle, she might be willing to share it again, but she's in the middle of her class now.\nWhile Monica sniffled softly, Casey thought for a moment before taking her own tea can.\n\"Just use my tea leaves. I know this means we'll serve the same type of tea, but better than ending up with nothing to serve.\"\n\"But… I-I can't trouble you…\"\nIf they serve the same tea, it will be evaluated as a lack of prior preparation.\nThen, not only Monica, but Casey would receive a point deduction as well.\nBut Casey was just as nonchalant, waving her hands dismissively.\n\"Don't worry about that. I don't care what kind of tea served at a tea party, as long as it's tasty and enjoyable, then that's all that matters.\"\nStopping her sniffling, Monica then looked at the tea leaves in the trash can.\nCasey was certainly right. Most importantly, if she returned to the tea party without being able to prepare the tea, she might fail her lesson.\nBut…\nMonica clenched her fists and stood up on shaky legs.\nShe then turned around before ran out of the preparation room.\n\"Monica! Where are you going?!\"\n\"I-I'm sorry, I'll be back soon!\"\nAfterleft saying that, Monica started running off to her room in the dormitory.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nLana stared at Claudia in annoyance as she bit on the butter cake.\nClaudia seemed to be staring at the departing Monica, but the atmosphere returned to gloomy as soon as she was out of sight.\nHer long black eyelashes lowered as she stared at her cup of tea, making her beauty look so delicate. And yet, the gloom and unapproachability she exuded were amazing in their own way.\nWhat is this? What is this? What is this…?\nLana bit her lip then looked down at the cup of tea she had served.\nAlthough wealthy, Lana's father was not born noble. Even he was from a wealthy merchant family, because of his contributions to the development of the city, he was given a peerage shortly before Lana was born.\nLana had been raised with the finest luxuries and trendy dresses for as long as she could remember.\nEveryone said Lana was a \"blessed young lady.\"\nBut Lana was lonely.\nAmong the children of families without titles, the blessed Lana always felt out of place. She didn't fit in well with the other children and was accused of bragging about her riches.\nThat's why she thought she would be able to make friends similar to her own if she entered Serendia Academy where most of the noble children attended.\nHowever, in a school where lineage and prestige matter, Lana was treated as the daughter of a wealthy family with no refinement. To top it all off, her father was accused of having bought his title with money.\nYou have no sense of decency, no sense of manners, no understanding of the unspoken rules of nobility… The more someone said those words to her, the more Lana became stubborn.\nWhen Lana first approached Monica, it was only on a whim.\nSince Monica was not as good as her and stood out in class, taking care of her satisfied Lana's pride a little.\nAbove all, although Monica tended to hang her head down, when Lana offered her a little help she would smile like a blooming small flower. This tickled sensation made Lana can't leave her alone. Whenever Monica looked at Lana with respect, Lana's heart was slightly filled with joy.\nIn fact, she was expecting Monica's adoring gaze at today's tea party. She even had chosen the tea leaves with great enthusiasm, but Claudia pointed out that they were inappropriate, and Lana's pride was in tatters.\nWhy does it always have ended up this way?\nAll I wanted was… to give my friend the best tea I could.\nIt brought back memories of her childhood when she served the best pastries and tea to her friends she invited to her house only to be criticized for \"bragging about being rich\" behind her back.\nLana simply wanted to give her friend the most wonderful thing to eat.\n\"Well, sorry for the long wait.\"\nCasey, who had been absent, quickly came back. But Monica was not standing next to her.\nLana asked with her eyes, \"Where's Monica?\" Casey scratched her cheek with a vague expression and took a seat.\n\"Hmm, well… I think she'll come here soon.\"\n\"You weren't helping Monica prepare tea, were you?\"\nIn response to Lana's question, Casey muttered crisply, \"No, it's…\"\nWhat exactly is going on? Did something happen to Monica?\nAs Lana sat up, a soft, pleasant smell tickled her nose. But it was not the smell of tea.\n\"T-Thank you… for waiting…\"\nWith her unreliable wobbling feet, in an almost dangerous, Monica approached the table. On the tray in her hands were an empty cup and an unfamiliar pot.\nMonica placed the tray on the table and wiped the sweat from her forehead. It seemed that just carrying the tray up there was a big task for the non-athletic Monica.\nClaudia, who had been looking unenthusiastic, slowly raising up her head then stared at the pot.\n\"…It doesn't smell like tea.\"\n\"This… is a coffee…\"\nLooking straight at Claudia, Monica said in a shaky voice.\n\"L-Lady Claudia. Since you said, If you start the party with something of a strong flavor, it will numb your tongue… So, since I am the last, having coffee with a strong taste should not be a problem.\"\n\"Coffee is a drink for men. I don't think it's appropriate for a women's tea party.\"\nWhat Claudia said was correct. Coffee has indeed become quite popular in this country, and while coffee houses do exist, it is mostly men who drink them.\nAbove all, coffee has a strong bitter and sour taste, making it difficult to please everyone. Although Lana had tried it a few times, she was not very fond of it.\nBut then again, Monica said firmly, which was unusual for her.\n\"D-Don't worry. I think it will taste delicious, so…\"\nShe then poured the coffee from the pot into the cups and added warmed milk to the three cups.\n\"S-Since it is meant to be drunk as a palate cleanser after a meal, I really want people to drink it as is, but I know many people don't like bitterness, so I add milk to your cup. You can add more sugar if you like.\"\nAfter the cups were handed out to all of them, Claudia was the first to lift her cup. After smelling at the aroma, she sipped it.\n\"………\"\nClaudia's unresponsive attitude did scare her a little.\nBoth Lana and Casey added sugar to their cups before sipped timidly.\n\"What's this… there's no bitterness or sourness at all.\"\nMuttering, Lana sipped the contents of the cup once more. The mellowness of the milk enveloped the refreshing bitterness.\nThat was a flavor that Lana had never tasted before.\nCasey was also looking at the cup closely, surprised.\n\"Hey, I've never had this kind of coffee before… is it supposed to be this easy to drink?\"\nIt was understandable for Casey to say that.\nSpeaking of coffee, until a long time ago, it used to be made by boiling down ground beans then added with sugar. But, after siphons and other tools have become popular recently, many flavorful coffees have been appearing.\nStill, the coffee that Monica prepared was more than flavorful.\nClaudia gazed at the silver pot then muttered.\n\"…coffee tastes more bitter the longer it is brewed.\"\n\"Y-Yes… That's why I use this pot to make a quick extraction. This pot uses steam power to brew coffee in a short time…\"\n\"…I've never seen this appliance before. Not even in a book.\"\nAt Claudia's muttering, Lana and Casey widened their eyes.\nClaudia was probably the most knowledgeable person here… no, perhaps at this school.\nHaving born in the lineage of a family that had such a vast amount of knowledge, she was nicknamed as \"walking library.\"\nAnd for someone like her, How could there's nothing she did not know about!\nClaudia drank the contents of her cup cleanly and looked at Monica with blue eyes that were still unreadable.\n\"I see, not a bad way to catch me off guard. But this is a \"tea ceremony class,\" remember? A drink that isn't even tea is completely out of that category.\"\n\"W-Well, I think so… B-But…\"\nMonica looked down and picked up her own cup.\nHer cup was the only one that did not have milk in it. She was probably used to drinking bitter coffee.\n\"I… I wanted my dearest friend to drink what I love the most… So… Um…\"\nWaring both of her hands around her cup, Monica lowering her eyebrows then smiled.\n\"…I guess I'm the most inappropriate here.\"\nAs Monica smiled shyly, Lana felt as if her mind was going blank.\nWhat is this? What is this? What is this…?\nLana thought that her tea was the most inappropriate at this table, but now Monica brought in coffee that was more inappropriate for a tea party. She would probably get a point deduction.\nLana gulped down the contents of her cup.\n\"It's really good… I like it a lot,\" said Lana as she tried to hold back her tears, looking at Monica's smile which still looks like a blooming flower.",

      "content": "That night after the tea party lesson in the courtyard ended, Monica was working on her report in her attic room.\nGetting point deduction was a matter of fact after serving coffee at the tea party. Since Lana and Casey negotiated a lot with the teacher, the teacher didn't deduct all her points, instead, they made her write a report.\nBeside Monica, who was writing her report, was Nero licking a cup of coffee with plenty of milk poured in. In his cat form, Nero dexterously clutching a small cup with his paws, sticking his face into the cup.\n\"Phew, this thing is not bad. So this is what a grown man tastes like.\"\nGrown men won't pour so much sugar and milk into their drinks.\nExasperated at his comment, she finished her report then put back her quill pen at its place, then let out a deep sigh.\nRecalling her tea leaves that had thrown into the trash can, Monica was certain it was an intentional act to harass her.\nThese things will keep occurring from now on, won't they?\nTheir hatred toward Monica will keep increasing day by day for sure.\nBut, what Claudia did hurts her head even more.\n\"Nero…\"\n\"Oh, what's up?\"\n\"I just wondering… maybe someone knew my true identity as the Silent Witch…\"\nRaising his head from the cup, Nero with his whiskers smeared in milk, said.\n\"Wanna do night escape?\"\n\"Why did you always make such a decision?\"\n\"Well, if your identity discovered, Lululu Lunpa will kill you, won't he?\"\n\"…It's Louis. Please remember it, will you?\"\nWhile Nero was licking his cup, Monica pondered.\nIf her identity discovered, she will be forced to end this undercover mission.\nLouis might give her a smile of indignation, but she will back to her quiet daily days, hiding back herself in the cabin, reading and calculating formula as she pleased. Without worrying about her social life.\n…Even so, why she can't honestly happy about that?\n\"Um… My identity hadn't been discovered for certain… So I guess I will keep an eye just to make sure.\"\nFeeling Monica's unwillingness, Nero narrowed his golden eyes, then said, \"Oh, really~\" in a teasing manner.\n\"If this you a while ago, you would have cried out, ‘I had enough~ I can't~ I wanna go home~'\"\n\"Ugh… W-Well… you might be right… but…\"\nWhile Monica fidgeting with her finger, Nero leaped onto Monica's lap, tapping at Monica's thigh. His gesture was like that of humans who consoles their acquaintance.\n\"Why but? If you've got a little bit of an attachment to this place, I don't think that's a bad thing.\"\n\"…is that… alright? …yeah, you right…\"\nNero was right. For Monica, this school was no longer a place filled with only bad memories.\nAlthough not many, she has friends, who would lend her a hand when she's in trouble. That was something new for Monica, who had previously shut herself off from socializing.\nBut, that timid and clumsy ‘Monica Norton' was only her temporary identity.\nEventually, when her mission is over, Monica will leave the school and return to her life in the cabin.\nWhen that happened, she would never see the people she had met at this school as \"Monica Norton\" again.\n…and Monica will return back to be Monica Everett of the Seven Sages, Silent Witch.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nOne week after the tea party.\nMonica was completely at loss.\nAs soon as lunch break came, Monica hurriedly left the classroom. Even though she was the first one to leave the classroom, she still couldn't let her guard down.\nAfter looking around restlessly, Monica took a large stride to leave the school building.\nThis should be fine… right?\nThought Monica while raising her gaze, but then she saw a figure with black hair stood in the shade of a water fountain, only to make her let a little gasp.\nIt was Claudia. When she standing near the water fountain, her figure was like a figurine, but when she noticed Monica, she only turned her gaze, staring intensely at her.\nShe's been like that all this week.\nClaudia would appear wherever Monica went, only to stare at her from a distance.\nShe never came close or talked to her. All she did was looking at her, which was made her behavior would only look creepier.\nWhen Monica hurriedly trying to head to the back of the school building… *bam* she bumped into someone and fell on her butt.\n\"I-I'm sorry…\"\nWhile holding her nose that bumped into, Monica raised her gaze, then found Glenn looking at her with widened eyes.\n\"Monica, are you okay?\"\n\"I… I'm sorry…\"\nEven in her apologizing, Monica still trying to find a place to hide. And Glenn, who looked at Monica's state, muttered, \"Oh!\" as if he had figured something.\n\"You're being followed by someone, aren't you?\"\n\"W-Well… something like that…\"\n\"Alright, let me help you!\"\nGlenn held Monica lightly by his side, chanted a short incantation, then kicked the ground.\nWith Monica in his arm, Glenn floated up with a flight spell, jumped onto a fairly thick tree, then released the spell.\n\"Now they won't catch you so easily here! This is my favorite place to take a nap!\"\n\"Thank… Thank yo—\"\nJust when Monica about to thank him.\nShe saw someone down walking toward the tree. It's Claudia.\nShe walked near the tree then quietly passing by… or so they thought, instead she stopped her foot right in front of the tree where they're up there.\nIn a spur moment, Monica used her no-chant spell to create a wind gust aiming at the tree not far from her. By swaying that tree a little should have to move Claudia's attention.\nAnd Claudia was staring at the swaying tree below the tree where's Monica up there.\n\"… is it just my imagination?\"\nClaudia muttered to herself, then went deeper into the backyard of the school building.\nAfter making sure her figure disappeared, Monica sighed out quietly, and Glenn relaxed his brows then looked at Monica.\n\"Are you being bullied by that person?\"\n\"N-No… I'm not being bullied by her… I'm just being followed by her…\"\n\"In that case, you'd better speak up clearly! If you feel uncomfortable saying it, I'll say it for you, okay?\"\n\"T-Thanks… but, I'm fine…\"\nSince no real harm has been done, she can't denounce Claudia yet.\nWhat's more, Claudia might be aware of Monica's true identity. If she cornered Claudia, she might tell everyone that Monica was the \"Silent Witch,\" and it would be a disaster.\nShe's probably trying to keep an eye on me to see if I'm really the Silent Witch…\nIf Claudia was completely sure, she wouldn't be monitoring Monica like this.\nThen, it's better to stay quiet until Claudia gives up.\nAfterward, Monica asked Glenn to take her down from the tree, being asked, \"wanna grill some meat with me?\" but politely declined before heading back to the school building.\nIn the end, She used all her lunch break time. Although she's used to skipping her meals, after having run away from Claudia all this time, she was completely tired.\nI wish to enjoy my meal peacefully,\nthought Monica as she let out a sigh, but a few girls stood in front of her classroom, blocking her way into.\n\"May I have your time, Miss Norton?\"\nThe person who approached Monica was a blonde-haired young lady who seemed to be in the same grade. Because Monica can't recall her face, they should probably from a different class.\nMonica was taking precautions but only to be responded with a smirk from that young lady.\n\"I am Caroline Simons from the house of the Count Norn. I'd like to invite you to my tea party.\"\n\"Tea… party?\"\n\"Indeed. Class ended a little early today, doesn't it? So, before you do your student council work, why don't you come to my tea party? I've been wanting to get along with you for a long time.\"\nJudging from the atmosphere, the leader of this group should be Miss Caroline. Monica didn't know much about the house of Count Norn, but they should be a prestigious family in their own right.\nSo, unless Monica's got something important to do, she won't be able to refuse her invitation.\nNo, I don't wanna go\n, suppressing her whining thought, in a shaky voice, Monica responded to her.\n\"As… As long as it won't interfere with my duty on the student council…\"\n\"Of course. It won't take a long time.\"\nCaroline smiled happily and asserting, \"Right, everyone?\" while exchanging looks with the girls around her.\nThe other girls looked at Monica observantly, while affirming Caroline's words.\nA blatant look of disdain in their eyes spoke more eloquently than anything else, treating Monica as a shabby girl.\nIf she could, she would refuse her invitation. But she can't create any ruckus that would make her stand out in the school.\nOkay, I'll be fine, just drink the tea without saying anything needlessly until the end. I will be fine…\nWhile Monica desperately thought those words to herself, a pair of blue eyes like lapis lazuli was gazing intensely at her figure, and Monica hasn't noticed it.",

      "content": "Caroline's designated venue for the tea party was set in the courtyard tea table where the tea party practical lesson had been held the other days.\nThe current weather was nice, so many of the ladies seem to have tea parties here, and in addition to the table Monica was ushered to, there were several other table sets available for people to spend time at their own leisure.\nWith all these people watching, it's unlikely that they'll be ganging up on her in an obvious way or splashing tea over her head.\nFeeling a little relieved by this, Monica took her seat.\nBesides Monica, three other young ladies seated at the table. Caroline was seated facing Monica.\nCaroline was a young lady with big, bright eyes. Though she was the same age as Monica, she was more mature and had a glamorous air about her.\nHuh? Why these people's eyes were…\nUnder the bright courtyard with the afternoon sun, Monica felt a small sense of discomfort.\nBut before Monica could mention her discomfort, Caroline's chambermaid handed out the tea.\nSmiling, Caroline sipped her tea.\n\"Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to come here today, Miss Norton.\"\n\"T-Thank you for inviting me.\"\nMonica, who has trouble making eye contact with anyone, kept her head down before speaking in hushed tones.\nIt made the young ladies next to her giggle behind their fans. Their laughter, like a chorus of series of small chuckles, was strangely disturbing. And yet, when Caroline opened her mouth, it stopped.\n\"Where do you come from, Miss Norton?\"\n\"Rennac…\"\n\"My, then perhaps you're related to the Counts Kerbeck family?\"\nMonica thought back to the setting Louis Miller had come up with.\nAccording to his settings, she was the adopted daughter of the former countess. Then, it would be safe to say that she's related to the Count Kerbeck family.\n\"Y-Yes… The Count and his family have been very kind to me…\"\nMonica admired herself for being able to respond so well.\nDespite her timidness and stuttering, she has made unbelievable progress compared to the Monica of the past. After all, she now was able to hold a conversation.\nAs Monica was thinking about this, the lady right next to her opened her mouth.\n\"Say, Miss Norton. What do you usually discuss with the student council president?\"\n\"…huh? Well, it just… about…\"\nIn fact, Monica never spoke to Felix, except when it came to student council activities.\nSometimes Felix tried to initiate the conversation with Monica, but she would just tell herself that she was a rock and sit quietly whenever he did.\n\"I envy you being able to serve by His Highness' side.\"\n\"Indeed, you can see His Highness' face every day, after all.\"\nThe young ladies gazed up into the air in fascination and let out a longing sigh.\nAs Monica watched the scene, she was deeply impressed by the power of the golden ratio in attracting people's hearts.\nWhat would be the result if you put a golden ratio sculpture and a non-golden ratio sculpture side by side and took statistics to see which one was more desirable?\nThinking vaguely about this, Monica lifted the cup.\nWhen that happened, Caroline and the others lifted their fans in unison to cover their mouths.\nIs this… a basic move of a villainess that Lady Isabelle told me recently!?\nThe chorus of giggles coming from behind the fan had a precision that could only be a result of training. It was neither too loud nor too quiet, and the nastiness of the laughter that disturbed her ears was quite exquisite.\nI see, so this is\nthat\nmove… while admiring something out of place, Monica sipped from her cup of tea.The taste of the tea in her mouth was rather bitter. It was not astringent, but bitter.\nI wonder if this tea is supposed to have a taste like this.\nIt was bitter, to say the least, but not undrinkable.\nMonica, who was accustomed to drinking bitter coffee regularly, felt a little uncomfortable with the tea, but she drank it.\nImmediately, the color of the ladies faces changed.\nHmm? Is there something wrong with me?\nThe ladies peeled their eyes open and looked at Monica as if they were looking at something uncanny. Their faces looked pale.\nMonica took another sip of the intensely bitter tea to cover her impatience, wondering if she had done something wrong.\nMiss Caroline made a small \"Ah\" sound.\nHuh?\nHer pounding heart sounded awfully loud. Her vision blurred and distorted, and their figures became blurred.\n\"Did she drink it?\"\n\"Are you kidding me? That tea is so bitter, you know?\"\n\"Oh, my God. I was expecting her to choke herself…\"\nThe ladies were saying something quickly to each other in dismay. Their voices were certainly reaching Monica's ears, but her mind could not perceive their words.\nTheir voices slipped through her ears as nonsensical sounds.\nWhat… is happening?\nHer world distorted mushily. Distorting, zooming, blurring, melting, finally dyed by the tea color… No, this red was not the color of the tea.\nThis red… was of fire.\nAnd behind the flickering fire was a silhouette of a person.\n\"…dad…?\"\nThe figure of her father, tied to a tree, was fading into the flames. An unpleasant smell pervaded her nose. It was the smell of burning human flesh.\n\"Ah… Ah…\"\nThe people surrounding her father raised their voices.\n—Heretic! You damn heretic! You damned blasphemous sinner!\n\"…no… my father has done nothing wrong…\"\nSomeone threw something into the burning fire. It was a huge amount of records that her father had written with all his might before he died…\n\"No… no… don't burn it… please don't burn it…\"\nThe numbers were burning, the beautiful numbers and records that have been accumulated over the years were burned, turning to ashes in an instant.\nI must memorize it, all of it. I must memorize all of the numbers that my father left me.\nMonica stared intently at the records of the numbers being thrown at her without taking her eyes off the burning flames.\nWith Monica's unreliable eyesight, she could only see fragmentary numbers in the vast amount of data. Nevertheless, Monica burned the numbers she saw into her mind.\nI have to remember it. I have to remember the records that my father left behind, even just a little bit.\nThe numbers she burned into her eyes were all left by her father. She would never forget them. They were the proof of her father's life.\n\"…18473726, 385, 20985.726, 29405.84739, 235. 2108877, 25…\"\n—All you do is talk about numbers. It's disgusting! Stop talking nonsense!\n\"I'm sorry, Uncle. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\"\n—Because of my brother's stupid research, I now have to suffer the consequences! How can I be in business when I've got a criminal in my family? Stop screwing around!\n\"No… my father has done nothing wrong… my father is…\"\n—You've got to be kidding me! Try saying that shit outside! I'll beat you with an iron rod!\n\"I'm sorry, Uncle, please don't hit me, please don't hit me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I won't say any more unnecessary things in public, I'll keep my mouth shut, so don't hit me, don't hit me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry…\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThe courtyard was in an uproar.\nMonica Norton suddenly fell out of her chair, fainting in agony.\nHer face was pale and she was breathing unnaturally, choking up and mumbling incomprehensible words in between.\nCaroline and the others who were sitting with her looked at Monica as if they were looking at something uncanny.\nIn the midst of all this, a young lady quickly approached their table.\nIt was a tall, beautiful woman with straight black hair, Claudia.\nClaudia wordlessly kneeled down in front of Monica and checked on her condition.\n\"…What did you give to her?\"\nAt Claudia's words, Caroline shook her head and exclaimed in a shrill voice.\n\"I don't know! I have no idea! I don't know anything!\"\n\"………\"\nStanding up quietly, Claudia closed the distance between her and Caroline—like a snake was creeping up on her—then shoved her hands into her pockets.\nHer hand was searching for something.\n\"…an eye drop?\"\n\"No! Give it back! Don't touch my things without permission! ….Hiiiek!\"\nWhen Caroline was screaming, Claudia silently grabbed her by the mouth. She then placed her other hand near Caroline's eyes.\nClaudia then lifted Caroline's make-up-tinted eyelids forcefully and closely examined her eyes.\n\"Your pupils are enlarging… I guess it's belladonna or a similar poison.\"\n\"This is just an eye drop that makes your eyes look bigger!\"\n\"It's poison.\"\nAfter Claudia crisply dismissed Caroline's reasoning with a single sentence, she then fixed her eyes straight on Caroline's enlarging pupils, declared her statement.\n\"You… poisoned that girl.\"\n\"No… I just… want to have her choke up after drinking a bitter tea… I mean, how could I know that she would drink up something that bitter! That girl just is crazy!!\"\nClaudia did not look at Caroline anymore but kneeled down beside Monica. She then raised Monica's upper body and plunged her fingers into her mouth.\n\"…ah… ugh…\"\n\"Throw it up.\"\nEven though Claudia stimulated the back of her throat, Monica couldn't vomit it properly, only convulsing.\nClaudia clicked her tongue and gave instructions to those watching in the distance.\n\"Somebody, bring me diluted saline water and some milk. And contact the infirmary and… student council members.\"",

      "content": "When Monica recalled her memories about her father, the only thing she could remember was his back figure.\nHis figure who was facing the table throughout the days as a researcher.\nDad… Dad…\nHoping that he could turn his gaze to her, the young Monica could only reach out her hand toward his back figure… only to pull her hand back.\nShe understood her father was doing an important job, that's why she didn't want to bother him.\nBut, as if he heard Monica's inner voice, he stopped his writing hand, then turned his gaze at Monica.\nBehind his glasses put on his face full of beard were the calm eyes of an intelligent person. Her father always has a calm demeanor.\nHer father reached out the hand she was pulling back, and wrapped it around with both of his hands. That made Monica happy, to unable to hold her voices.\n\"…Ehe… Dad…\"\n\"Hmm? Am I really that old?\"\n\"Your Highness, there's no need to listen to this little girl's nonsense.\"\n\"Oh, I thought you're going to wake her up with a slap?\"\n\"W-Well… I mean… this girl is sick…\"\nA familiar voice came from just above her.\nMonica groaned softly before opening her eyes.\nApparently, she was on a bed in the infirmary. It was the same place she had been taken to before.\nMonica found two figures standing beside her sleeping bed. Sparkling in the slightest light, it's honey blonde and platinum blonde.\n\"Your Highness and… Lord Ashley…?\"\nFelix Ark Ridill, the student council president, and Cyril Ashley, the vice president.\nThe one that grasping Monica's hand was Felix.\nWhy are these two people here? Why is Felix holding onto Monica's hand?\nMonica's mind, which had begun to slowly awaken, vaguely recalled the events that had led her to this point.\nIf I recall correctly, my head felt dizzy after drank that bitter tea…\nFrom that point on, the rest of her memory was very vague. She felt like having a nightmare.\n\"You were drugged by the daughter of Count Norn at the tea party. Being poisoned, you were in a terrible stupor.\"\n\"!!!\"\nMonica paled quickly and pulled her own hand out of Felix's. She then rolled off the bed and forced her still weak body to place her forehead against the floor.\n\"Hey, little girl, what are you doing!?\"\nCyril sounded surprised and tried to get Monica to stand up.\nBut Monica remained to prostrate on the floor, her motionless lips quivering as she squeezed out the words.\n\"…I apologize… for any inconvenience… I may… have caused you.\"\nAs soon as she said the word, she felt nauseated by it. Her head was spinning and she felt dizzy.\nStill, she felt she had to apologize. Because Monica had ruined the tea party and caused a commotion, that's all.\n\"I apologize… for not able to live up as the student council members…\"\nTears welled up in her eyes as she apologized. Somehow, the back of her eyes was extremely hot. Tears spilled from her tear glands, which had become even looser than usual.\n\"Miss Norton, please raise your head.\"\nFelix dropped to his knees and stroked Monica's hair. But Monica couldn't raise her head.\nThey must be so disappointed in her, thinking she's an ignorant person who can't even behave properly at a tea party.\nThere were so many things she could think of to blame herself for. As she was grinding her own heart out, thinking of endless words to blame herself with, a hand plunged into Monica's armpit.\nThat hand lifted Monica like lifting a kitten.\n\"Hey! How dare you make His Highness kneel before you!\"\nIt was Cyril who lifted Monica up.\nAh, because of her inability to conduct herself, Lord Ashley got mad at her again… thought Monica sobbingly, only responded with a grunt by Cyril.\n\"You were a victim! Why would a victim apologizing?\"\n\"B-But…\"\n\"A sick person with a deathly complexion shouldn't talk nonsense! Next time you get out of bed without permission, I'll tie you to the bed with a rope!\"\nCyril raised his eyebrows as he made a rather frightening declaration.\n\"My, what are you raving about in the infirmary? …My.Dear.Bro.Ther?\"\nThe curtain dividing the bed swung, revealing nothing but a beautiful face.\nStraight black hair and lapis lazuli eyes. A young lady with beautiful looks and a gloomy atmosphere, she was Claudia.\nBrother?\nCyril stared at Claudia with a startled look on his face, then bent his lips into a frown and fell silent.\nFelix, on the other hand, gave Claudia a beaming smile.\n\"Miss Claudia Ashley, thanks to your excellent first aid, a student was saved. As student council president, I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you.\"\n\"…it's my pleasure to help.\"\nFor some reason, Claudia looked uncomfortable even though she was being thanked by the prince of this country.\nAt this attitude, which could be taken as disrespectful, Cyril raised his eyebrows.\n\"His Highness has honored you with his compliments. You should show a little more appreciation.\"\n\"Oh my, you want me to wag my tail like a praised, stupid dog like someone did?\"\nClaudia managed to pull off a clever move of snickering with a blank expression on her face.\nAs expected, the attitude that struck a nerve in most people made Cyril popped his veins.\n\"Who are you calling a dog!?\"\n\"No one said anything about you, my dear brother. My, what's wrong with your face? I had tried to carry the sick Monica Norton in my arms, but because of my lack of strength, after halfway through, I ran out of energy, so I asked the president to take over, that is. My.Dear.Bro.Ther.\"\nAt the words spoken in an indifferent voice, Cyril turned red, then pale, and finally, his face turned completely white. He simply felt so pathetic.\n\"…I'm sorry… if I'm heavy…\"\nAs Monica did her best to follow up, Cyril crunched and gnashed his teeth. But he didn't say anything.\nWhat should I do? thought Monica in fluster, and Felix stroked Monica's cheek.\n\"You're not heavy. In fact, I'm surprised you're so light. You need to eat a little more.\"\n\"Y-Yes…\"\nAfter Felix put Monica's blanket back on, he turned his attention to Cyril.\n\"Well, I guess we shouldn't stay too long in a woman's infirmary. We'll be leaving soon.\"\nCyril's expression, which had been drawn out by Claudia, returned and he nodded \"yes\" to Felix's words.\nThen he glanced at Monica and told her.\n\"Monica Norton. You don't have to come to the student council room today. If you do, consider that you have no work to do there.\"\n\"You should go back to your dormitory and get a good rest.\"\nWith that, Cyril and Felix turned their backs on Monica.\nClaudia took a handkerchief out of her pocket and fluttered it around to show him off. With a blank expression, of course.\nThis blatant attitude of Claudia's made Cyril's temples tighten.\n\"Claudia. Keep an eye on that little girl to make sure she doesn't slip out of infirmary to come to the student council room.\"\n\"…Oh my, if you're worried, why didn't you just say so? You looked at Monica Norton's sleeping face with great concern, My.Dear.Bro.Ther.\"\nCyril was shaking all over and Felix was chuckling at the interaction between the two siblings as they walked out of the infirmary.\nAfter they left, the infirmary instantly became quiet. Monica gathered her courage and spoke to Claudia.\n\"Um… T-Thank you very much for your help with the first aid…\"\n\"…how far do you remember?\"\n\"Up to the point where I drank the tea…\"\nAfter that, all she could remember was that she was having a nightmare. The next thing she knew, she was on a bed in the infirmary.\nClaudia sat down in a nearby chair and brushed back her long black hair.\n\"The tea was laced with a pupil enlarging eye drop.\"\n\"…an eye drop? …ah, that's why, even though it's a bright place, Their pupils were…\"\nMonica had felt uncomfortable with Caroline ever since she had confronted her at the tea party in the courtyard.\nNormally, when someone was in a brightly lit place, their pupils become smaller in order to regulate the amount of light entering your eyes. However, Caroline's pupils were wide open.\n\"Um, did Lady Caroline have an eye disease?\"\n\"Those eye drops are for cosmetic purposes. The idiots who blindly believe that the bigger your pupils are, the more beautiful you are, will get involved with those eye drops without knowing their side effects.\"\nThe eye drops Caroline was carrying were originally intended to be used for eye diseases. As long as they are used in the proper dosage, they are not a problem, but if used in the wrong way, they can be poisonous.\nAnd, she put it into Monica's teacup.\n\"Those eye drops were laced with a mixture of ingredients that made them very bitter. They were planning to make you a laughing stock by making you choke from drinking the tea laced with it…\"\nThat's why Caroline had chosen the more crowded courtyard.\nThe whole idea was to ridicule Monica in front of the crowd as she choked uncomfortably as she drank her tea.\nHowever, what Caroline miscalculated was the fact that Monica drank it down.\n\"That… uh… was bitter, but it wasn't undrinkable.\"\n\"What do you think the creature's sense of taste is for? It's not for savoring delicious food. It's to distinguish between flavors and avoid the dangers of toxins.\"\nMonica was scolded in a roundabout way for not being able to avoid danger, and she fell silent.\nShe might not have been careful enough, that was for sure. But the fact that Caroline and the others had bad intentions toward her was quite obvious, so she shouldn't have said anything at all.\nClaudia mentioned that Monica couldn't vomit the poison properly, so they forced her to drink diluted saltwater to make her vomit the poison. When she had emptied her stomach, she was given milk to protect the mucous membrane of her stomach.\n\"The contents of your stomach were almost empty when I made you vomit. Judging by your appearance, you're underweight for your age, and I don't feel you're trying to maintain your health.\"\n\"Ugh…\"\nShe couldn't eat her lunch today was because she running away from Claudia. Still, the way Claudia pointed out Monica's lack nutrition has similarity to Rosalie's was painful to hear.\nLooking Monica's hanging down her head downheartedly, Claudia spoke to her in the same indifference tone.\n\"The smaller figure of that person, the less poison the dose to be lethal… Poisons that are not lethal to a normal adult figure person can be lethal to a child figure person… You've almost lost your life.\"\n\"…a child figure person…\"\nLaying back on the bed, Monica fixed her gaze at Claudia.\nShe was a slender, but tall, beautiful woman who showed off her curves. It was hard to believe that she was the same age as Monica.\nAlthough she had never had much of a complex about her figure, since befriending Lana and Casey, Monica had grown concerned about her childish appearance, if only slightly.\nAs Monica was getting secretly stricken with defeat, Claudia leaned forward to look into Monica's face.\n\"…Oh my, what's the matter, Child Girl. You're staring at me so intensely, Child Girl. Just so you know, don't take any solid food today. You're going to throw up, Child Girl.\"\n\"Y-You don't have keep saying ‘Child Girl' ‘Child Girl' to me…\"\n\"Because I don't want you to thank me for saving your life…\"\nHearing Claudia's words, Monica widened her eyes.\nCome to think of it, she also looked disgusted when Felix thanked her.\nMonica felt grateful to Claudia, of course, she want give her thanks to her. But, her response was not that of a person who hide their embarrassment, but unpleasant.\n\"Um… Is it because you don't like me… that you don't want to be thanked…?\"\nBeing asked in a shaky voice, Claudia straightened her posture.\nHer doll-like expression remained unchanged. However, there was a dark emotion, slightly different from malice, that swayed slightly in the depths of her lapis lazuli eyes.\n\"It's not that I dislike you… neither do I like you.\"\nWhen Claudia exhaled wearily, Monica boldly asked her.\n\"T-Then… Why… do you keep following me… for the past week…?\"\nMonica had always thought that it was because Claudia suspected her of identity as the [Silent Witch].\nBut Claudia—slitered like a snake—closed the distance soundlessly, looked into Monica's face and whispered faintly.\n\"…It's because you seduced my fiance.\"\n\"………….huh?\"\nAs Monica's mouth agape, Claudia continued her words without hesitation.\n\"If it were just a matter of being on the same student council, that wouldn't matter to me, but how could I allow anyone to even practice dancing with him? Even I've never had him dance with me.\"\nA student council member, dancing practice.\nFrom these two keywords, the first thing that came to Monica's mind was Felix and Cyril.\nBut since she and Cyril were siblings, the answer was obviously narrowed.\nDon't tell me, His Highness is her…\nIt was reassuring to know that Claudia hadn't discovered her true identity.\nBut never did she think that Felix's fiancee would misunderstand her for trying to seduce him!!\nThis misunderstanding had to be settled as soon as possible. The only thing Monica thought about Felix was that he had a body with a golden ratio.\nAs Monica was pondering how to hide the fact that she was on an escort mission and clear up Claudia's misunderstanding, she heard the door to the infirmary open.\n\"Monicaaaa! I've come to visiiit!\"\n\"Ssh! Ssh! Don't shout in the infirmary!\"\nThose familiar, buzzing voices were from Glenn and Neil.\nWithout asking, Glenn opened the curtains and approached the bed with his big toe.\n\"Monica, are you okay? Your face look so pale! Oh, I came to visit you. Is it okay if I bring you some meat?\"\n\"You can't give meat to someone who just been poisoned.\"\nNeil, who chided Glenn, smiled somewhat awkwardly when he noticed Claudia sitting there on the side of the bed.\n\"Oh, Miss Claudia, good day to you.\"\n\"……..\"\nClaudia's face was expressionless. However, the air she wore had clearly changed. The depressed and languid air has disappeared completely.\nNeil looked slightly troubled at Claudia, who was staring at him with a blank expression.\n\"Well, I heard from the student council president. He told me that you gave first aid to Miss Norton, Miss Claudia.\"\n\"………\"\nAs expected, Claudia was silent and expressionless. She didn't even have a single word to say.\nNeil lowered his eyebrows in trouble, but tried his best to continue speaking.\n\"You are indeed a remarkable woman, Miss Claudia! That's amazing!\"\n\"…right.\"\nAt that moment, Monica was sure she saw it.\nMuttering in a faint voice, the corners of Claudia's mouth lifted up… only slightly.\nEven though she looked uncomfortable when Felix praised her, Claudia now showed a slight hint of happiness.\nCould it be, her fiance is…\nWhen Monica finally realized this fact, Glenn said, \"Aah!\" and stared at Claudia with a loud voice.\n\"This woman! She has been following Monica around before…\"\n\"Eh? Following around?\"\nAt Glenn's comment, Neil windener his eyes in surprise.\nThen Claudia—quieter than a snake—stood up, and slid over to Monica's bed.\n\"That's a misunderstanding. We're friends, after all.\"\nThis was news to her. If anything, Claudia just told her that she neither dislikes nor likes her, or that she has a child figure.\nBut Claudia nimbly grabbed Monica's hand who had dumbfounded expression and said.\n\"…right? We're friends, right? Mo.Ni.Ca?\"\nWhat a brilliant change of heart.\nAs Monica stunned, Claudia stared at her with lapis lazuli eyes. Monica was overwhelmed by the pressure of her silence.\n\"Y-Yes…\"\nMonica nodded stiffedly, and Claudia said, \"See?\" then looked at Glenn and Neil.\n\"…besides, I'm Neil's fiancée. Are you questioning your friend's fiancee?\"\n\"What!? Fiancee!? You're Neil's fiancee!?\"\nNeil vaguely laughs at Glenn's loud yelling.\n\"Well, the engagement was just something that our parents decided on their own…\"\n\"Oh, are you not pleased being engaged with me?\"\nClaudia turned her doll-like face to Neil. The fact that her face was so well-defined gave her a strange sense of intimidation, even without an expression.\nNeil's face tensed up and he shook his head.\n\"No, no, it's not like that. If anything, I feel like I'm not good enough for you, Miss Claudia, but… well…\"\nNeil's eyes kept glancing at the top of Claudia's head.\nAt that moment, the inner voices of Monica and Glenn overlapped.\nAh their height…\nNeil was slightly smaller than most boys his age. Claudia, on the other hand, was considered tall for a woman… their height difference was apparent to everyone.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nWalking down the corridor, Felix retracted his unusually soft smile. Doing so made his brilliant and extremely beautiful face stand out even more.\nHaving felt a quiet irritation from Felix, Cyril, who was walking behind him, also wore a quiet expression on his face.\nAs Felix walked, he silently confronted the frustration within himself.\nOh, what a mess. I am someone who prefers not to lose my temper.\nThe emotion of anger inside of him was supposed to be directed at the right person at the right time. It's not something that should be vented here.\nStill, the image of Monica from earlier clawed back into Felix's mind.\n—I apologize… for not able to live up as the student council members…\nThe figure of the girl, who was trembling a little with tears in her eyes, overlapped with that of the young boy.\n—I apologize for not able to live up as the royal family…\nReally, the figure of that girl is similar to me…\nQuietly confirming this, Felix spoke up.\n\"This whole thing is making me a little angry.\"\nCyril's expression tightened at Felix's unusually cold words.\n\"I have the ringleader, the daughter of Count Norn, and the other two waiting in the reception room for questioning. And…\"\nCyril trailed off and looked around, whispering to Felix.\n\"…the daughter of Count Kerbeck came into the student council room. She wants to talk to the daughter of Count Norn.\"\n\"The daughter of Count Kerbeck? Oh, little squirel's little sister?\"\n\"She's her niece without blood relation.\"\nMuttering a hmmm, the edge of Felix's lips raised.\n\"Good. Then have the daughter of Count Kerbeck be present as well.\"\nSmiling chillingly at his beautifully formed face, Felix declared.\n\"Now, let's have a nice tea party.\"",

      "content": "Caroline Simons, the daughter of Count Norn, was sitting in a chair in the salon, irritably playing with the tassel on her fan.\nThe two friends sitting next to her were looking at her resentfully, which was also annoying.\nWeren't you all totally into it?!\nShe was just reminding Monica Norton, who had been carried away lately, of her place in the academy.\nHer appearance was too shabby and her behavior was so unbecoming to be considered a girl. For some reason, the girl who was not worthy of this academy was elected to the student council.\nTo top it all off, she was taught how to dance by Felix and Cyril.\nThose two were the stars of the academy. When she saw them at a party early this summer, Caroline attempted to get close to them somehow, but her attempt was a failure.\nAs people always gathered around Felix and Cyril, Caroline could only watch from afar, unable to talk to them, let alone ask them to dance.\nAnd yet… how could that girl dance with them!?\nThe fan in her grip creaked and squeaked.\nEverything was Monica Norton's fault. All she did was serve a slightly bitter tea.\nAnd yet, she made such a big deal out of it and brought shame to Caroline. What a hateful girl!\nEverything was her fault! Everything!\nA small crack appears on her fan. It was her favorite fan, but now it's broken. She has to beg her father for a new one.\nIt will be fine. She believed that her father will help her. He doted on Caroline and donated a lot of money to the school. There was no way she would be expelled.\n\"Please excuse us.\"\nThere was a knock at the door and two students entered the room.\nA softly swaying honey blonde with mysterious blue eyes tinted with green color, the always calm atmosphere of the second prince, Felix Ark Ridill.\nAnd platinum blond hair mixed with a little honey and dark blue eyes resemble winter snow, the renowned ice prince, and also the eldest son of Marquis Highon, Cyril Ashley\nThey were the student council president and vice-president of this academy, representing the pinnacle among the students.\nFelix took a seat across from Caroline and crossed his legs. Cyril stood behind him, glaring at Caroline and the others with cold eyes.\nCyril wore a rigid face, but Felix was smiling as softly as ever.\nI knew it! His Highness would understand my action! I'm not at fault!\nAs Caroline patted her chest in relief, Felix spoke up in a gentle voice.\n\"Caroline Simons, the daughter, of Count Norn. Shall we hear your side of the story in the attempt of poisoning Miss Monica Norton?\"\nPoisoning. At that word, Caroline and her friends' faces quickly changed.\nEven if you were a noble, murder is a serious crime. Even if it's merely an attempt, you will be punished with that equivalent crime.\n\"It was a misunderstanding, Your Highness! It was just a prank! And yet, Monica Norton has taken it upon herself to make a big deal out of it. That girl… must have been trying to embarrass me!\"\n\"By a prank, you mean putting poison into your classmate's cup?\"\nFelix's calm voice remained unchanged.\nAnd yet, the words that thrust to her were utterly cold and merciless.\nCaroline pleaded with teary eyes.\n\"That thing's not poisonous! It's just an eye drop! I've heard that it's very bitter and can be used as medicine to calm down… That's why I thought it would be good to bring her frightful manner to her senses…\"\nThe latter part was just random nonsense.\nThe eyedrops bought from the merchant were said to be very bitter and should not be consumed. At the time, she just laughed at the idea of consuming eye drops. But now, she will bring any excuse as long as she could get away with it.\nAs she was rattling off her excuses, Cyril pulled a small bottle wrapped in a handkerchief out of his pocket.\nIt was Caroline's eye drop that was confiscated when she was taken into this salon.\n\"My younger sister, Claudia, told me that the eye drop you were carrying were regulated by law. You need to be a doctor or a certified pharmacist to be eligible to possess this item.\"\nCyril's dark blue pupils glinted as he glared coldly at Caroline.\n\"Possessing such a dangerous drug illegally and then giving it to someone else… is if not attempted murder, then what?\"\nCyril's younger sister, Claudia Ashley, was a true descendant of the \"Intelligent Family.\"\nAlso known as a \"walking library,\" she has a vast amount of knowledge that surpasses that of adults. If she declares so, then her words must be true.\nCaroline grew pale, but still desperately tried to find a way out.\n\"I didn't know that this eye drop was such a dreadful thing. I was told that it was just an eye drop… Oh, Your Highness, please believe me!\"\nAs she pleaded with tears streaming down her face, Felix smiled softly.\n\"Right, without prior knowledge, you dripped that eye drop into Miss Monica Norton's cup, out of mischief.\"\n\"T-That's right.\"\n\"And you did that to humiliate Miss Norton.\"\nIn response to the words dropped calmly, Caroline bit her lip tightly and fell silent.\nFelix put his hand over his mouth and chuckled.\n\"I guess we can add libel to the list.\"\n\"!!!\"\nShe was sure her excuses were pretty good. But why has Felix not said anything to help Caroline? Why won't Felix defend her?\nAt this moment, Caroline still really thought that she could get away with it if she passed it off as ignorance.\nThen, a knock came on the door. After Felix gave permission, a female student stepped into the salon and bowed gracefully.\nIt was an orange-haired freshman styled into ringlets. She's a beautiful girl with a slightly stern face and a dignified air about her.\n\"My name is Isabelle Norton, the daughter of Count Kerbeck. I am very grateful to you for allowing me to be present here.\"\nMonica Norton was said to be under the care of Count Kerbeck's household. Then it would be natural for Isabelle, the daughter of Count Kerbeck, to be present here to hear the situation.\nIt will be fine… the daughter of Count Kerbeck loathes and harasses Monica Norton. If something happened to Monica Norton, the disgrace of Count Kerbeck's household, she probably wouldn't condemn me strongly.\nAs Isabelle sat down in the chair that Cyril had suggested, she cast her eyes down with a very apologetic look on her face.\n\"I have heard that our troublesome family member has caused trouble for you. Please accept my deepest apology on behalf of Count Kerbeck's household.\"\nNeither Felix nor Cyril said a word. But Caroline was secretly cheering in her heart.\nSee, I knew it! The daughter of Count Kerbeck has no qualms about cutting off Monica Norton!\nIf Isabelle hated Monica, she would surely be on her side… Caroline secretly laughed.\nIsabelle then glanced at Caroline and said.\n\"I know it's not much for an apology, but I've actually had my maids prepare some tea. I'm sure everybody is thirsty from all the talking. I do hope you will enjoy it.\"\nIsabelle called out across the door, and her maid quietly entered the room, placing a tray on the table.\nAs Caroline wondered why they weren't handing them out earlier, Isabelle smiled and pulled a small bottle out of her pocket.\nSeeing the small bottle, Caroline and her cronies shrieked inwardly then cowered.\nThe bottle was so similar to the bottle of eye drop that Caroline possessed.\n\"Right, since you are here, I hope you could try this medicine, Lady Caroline. I recently bought it from a merchant… I heard this beauty medicine has a very great effect.\"\nWith that, Isabelle dripped the liquid from the small bottle into the three cups.\nIsabelle's chambermaid then handed out cups to everyone. Isabelle, Felix, and Cyril were given cups without any medicine in them.\nWhile Caroline and her friend, the young ladies, were given cups dripped with medicine.\nAs Caroline stared at the cup with a strained face, Isabelle covered her mouth with a fan and chuckled.\nDespite the fact that her mouth was hidden, her smile was malevolent, clearly showing that she was mocking her.\n\"…Please help yourself.\"\nCaroline stared at the cup. As that eye drop was odorless, she could not smell anything other than tea.\nIs that small bottle the same as my eye drops? Why would the daughter of Count Kerbeck have that in her possession?\nThe fact that the daughter of Count Kerbeck just happened to possess the same eye drops as Caroline seems quite unnatural. But she believed it must be just a coincidence.\nHer companions, sitting next to her, looked at Caroline inquiringly. Neither of them even tried to touch the cup.\nStop it! If you act like that, it's like admitting that the eye drop I possess was poison!\nThere's no way it was the same eye drop. It must be a bluff.\nCaroline stared at the cup of tea, preparing herself, and took a sip.\n\"…pfft! Ugheee!\"\nThe strong bitter taste made Caroline spit out her tea. Salivating as she tried to avoid leaving a single drop in her mouth, she spat out the tea and glared at Isabelle with eyes full of murderous intent.\n\"It was poison! This woman tried to poison me!\"\n\"My…\"\nIsabelle was chuckling as she opened the lid of the small bottle and dripped it into her cup. She then drank the contents of the cup.\n\"I told you earlier, didn't I? It is good medicine for beauty. Well, perhaps you were surprised to find it a little bitter?\"\n\"Y-You…\"\n\"Fufu, is there a need for you to spew it out in such a disgraceful manner? I mean,\nthat\ngirl drank all the bitter tea you served her, didn't she?\"\nThat girl—it goes without saying that she was referring to Monica Norton.\nIsabelle huffed out a languid sigh and muttered.\n\"Indeed, that woman grew up in a bad environment and is the embarrassment of my household, but I appreciate the way she behaved as a guest, trying to drink all the tea, no matter how bad it was… but would that make you are less than that? And of all people, it's happening in the presence of His Highness, how vulgar.\"\nIsabelle then inclined her fan to show her mouth and snickered.\nCaroline, who had tried to humiliate Monica in front of the crowd, was now, of all people, being humiliated by spewing tea in front of Felix.\nWhat is this? What is this? What is this?\nFelix didn't say anything. He just watched the exchange between Isabelle and Caroline with a somewhat amused look on his face.\nIsabelle was sipping her tea calmly and said, \"Oh right,\" in a tone as if she was having a little chat.\n\"Regarding this matter, I will notify my father as soon as possible. I mean, a person with the surname of Norton was almost poisoned to death. It's only natural, isn't it?\"\n\"!!!\"\nIt was only now that Caroline realized the magnitude of what she had done.\nEven though Isabelle dislikes Monica, it didn't change the fact that Monica was the one bearing Norton's name.\n…Caroline had picked a fight with Count Kerbeck's household.\n\"I believe our Count Kerbeck's household has a close relationship with your hometown, Count Norn's household. It's shame it had become like this.\"\nCount Kerbeck's domain was the widest domain in the eastern part of the Kingdom of Ridill. Its scale was not something that could be mocked as rural nobles.\nAbove all, the mountainous areas in the east were home to many dragons, so those who had territories in the east were always suffering from dragon attacks. Although the dragon knights would come to the rescue if a request for help was sent to the royal capital, it would take a long time to reach the eastern part of the kingdom from the royal capital, so all the nobles who had territories in the eastern part usually had their own soldiers.\nAnd the biggest of them all was the Count of Kerbeck.\nFor this reason, when a dragon attacked a noble household in the east and the dragon knights couldn't get there in time, they often turned to the neighboring the Count of Kerbeck… and Caroline's own family, Count Norn's household, were no exception.\nCount Norn's household has been saved by the soldiers of Count Kerbeck's household many times whenever his territory was threatened by the dragon.\nHowever, what would happen if her daughter returned the favor with malicious intent?\nWhat if Count Kelbeck is not aiding the Norn Countdom anymore?\nThe weak military power of Count Norn would not be able to endure the dragon attacks, and at worst they could be destroyed.\n\"W-Wait… Y-You've got the wrong idea… I didn't mean it… to be like that…\"\nAs Caroline making excuses in a desperate manner, Isabelle gave her a cold look.\nIsabelle was younger than Caroline by a year. However, her intimidation was so overwhelming that even Caroline can't hold a candle.\nIsabelle only narrowed her eyes slightly, shattering Caroline's pride as she sneered at her.\n\"Because of your thoughtlessness, it brings ruin to your homeland… such things do often happen in high society, isn't it?\"\nIsabelle brushed back her orange ringlets as she smiled haughtily, lifting her chin.\n\"Now, when you get back to your dormitory, make sure you tell your dear friends… what will happen if they make an enemy of my Count Kerbeck's household!\"\nAs if she were speaking in a play, Isabelle was laughed \"O-ho-ho-ho-ho!\" in a high-pitched cheerful tone.",

      "content": "After Isabelle Norton has done her solo performance, Caroline Simmons and her two friends were taken by the teacher to another room. Cyril snorted as he watched them go.\nIt has not been officially decided yet, but Caroline, the perpetrator of the incident, will be forced to leave school, while her two friends were expected to leave voluntarily.\nUntil the very end, Miss Caroline refused to admit that she was at fault. On the contrary, she put the blame on Monica and tried to excuse herself.\nHow foolish.\nLike the previous treasurer who was expelled a while ago, they don't understand that this place serves as an extension of their social circle. They think that if something happens, their parents will lay out their money to fix it.\nIf money could buy trust, there would be no hardship… how thoughtless of them to think of that.\nOnce Caroline had left the room and things had quieted down, Isabelle Norton straightened herself up and bowed to Felix and Cyril.\n\"Your Highness, I apologize for the disgraceful appearance in your presence.\"\nIt was hard to believe that she had been doing\nthat\nhigh-pitched laughter just now. Cyril thought, \"Women are terrifying.\"\nFelix, however, responded with a gentle smile.\n\"It was quite amusing. By the way, do you think your father will abandon Count Norn?\"\nIn response to Felix's question, Isabelle shook her head without hesitation.\n\"No, my father is very sensible. He would never abandon another territory out of emotion.\"\nCount Norn's territory was one of the most important supply routes. Having the road closed after the damage caused by the dragon would prove to be quite inconvenient.\nWell, this was the powerful Count Kerbeck after all. He will probably use this matter as a bargaining card with the Norn Count family.\nCount Kelbeck was the most influential noble in the eastern part of the Kingdom of Ridill.\nThe eastern part of the Kingdom of Ridill has experienced many disasters caused by dragons, and since it was adjacent to several countries, including the empire, it will be the front line in case of emergency—therefore, the nobles in the eastern part of the kingdom have military power that rivals that of the royal capital.\nThis is why the eastern provinces were the most threatening if they started a rebellion.\nFearful of the eastern nobles rebelling and turning their troops against the center, the central nobles have been trying to control the size of the eastern nobles' army… that's what Cyril's adoptive father, Marquis Highon, once said.\nHowever, the nobility in the east can't reduce their forces so easily. The eastern part of the country has always been beset with two treats: the neighboring country and the dragons.\nThat's why my adoptive father said he doesn't want Count Kerbeck to become his enemy…\nIn the struggle to determine the next king, Count Kerbeck held a neutral position. Forcing them to take sides would be difficult.\nTherefore, keeping them from becoming enemies would be the safest thing to do.\nAs Cyril was pondering these things, Felix was speaking to Isabelle in a casual tone.\n\"Oh, speaking of Count Kerbeck's territory… That Black Dragon Wogan's incident must have been tough.\"\n\"On that occasion, we would like to thank His Majesty for dispatching the dragon knights from the capital. I am grateful for his prompt and generous action.\"\nTo Isabelle's auspicious attitude, Felix then said in a joking tone.\n\"Maybe the count's army alone could have managed without the arrival of the dragon knights?\"\nThe count's soldiers were accustomed to killing dragons, so they often managed to kill them before the Dragon Knights arrived. That's why Felix said in a roundabout way that it might have been unnecessary to dispatch the dragon knights, but Isabelle was like, \"Of course not!\" exclaimed.\n\"Our Count Kerbeck family has a history of fighting dragons for hundreds of years. Even with such a history, we have only faced a black dragon once before, two hundred years ago. The reason we were able to defeat the Black Dragon Wogan was thanks to the efforts of the dragon knights and… the Silent Witch who lend her power.\"\nThe [Silent Witch] was a young genius who became one of the Seven Sages two years ago at the tender age of fifteen.\nCyril had never seen her before, but it was rumored that the [Silent Witch] always wore a robe over her head and kept her head down, even during ceremonies, and never showed her face.\nA robe over her head?\nSomething stimulated Cyril's memory. A hooded robe was nothing unusual.\nBut a strange feeling rose in his heart… as he remembered the events of \"that night.\"\nWhile Cyril was quietly suppressing his agitation, Isabelle said in a slightly more excited tone.\n\"Although I didn't see it with my own eyes… I heard that [Silent Witch] shot down more than twenty wyverns that had been following the black dragon in an instant!\"\n\"Well, I'm not much of a magician, but that sounds amazing.\"\nFelix gestured at her in a way that seemed to be impressed.\nShoot down over 20 moving targets in an instant? …such a thing is impossible.\nDragons have a weakness for cold, but their bodies were sturdy and highly resistant to magic, making them impervious to most spells.\nTo defeat it, they would have to aim at the eyeballs or the space between the eyes, but accurately aiming at the space between the eyebrows or the eyeballs against a moving target would be extremely difficult, even for an advanced magician.\nIn addition, shooting down more than 20 of them at the same time, such a thing was…\nSuddenly, the events of the night a few weeks ago came back to Cyril's mind.\nTerribly advanced magic that accurately shot down the ice blocks released by Cyril, who had gone out of control.\nIt wasn't the kind of situation where the chanting could be done in time. And yet, that person was able to deploy such precise magic with Cyril's \"afterthought.\"\n—A silent monster.\nThat person might be able to use magic to target the eyebrows of more than twenty wyverns, just as he shot off Cyril's ice.\nAs he listened to Isabelle's impassioned talk about the [Silent Witch], Cyril had quietly pushed down his agitation.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAfter chatting with Felix, Isabelle left the salon and walked down the hallway with her chambermaid, Agatha in tow.\nShe could see the eyes of the students glancing at her. Most of them look at her in awe.\nIt was probably because Caroline had spread the word about what Isabelle had done to her early on.\n\"My Lady, are you sure about this?\"\n\"Yes, I was prepared for that.\"\nTrampling on someone is an act of making enemies, of course.\nStill, Isabel dared to retaliate against Caroline.\nStay out of the way of the Count Kerbeck family… Once that unspoken agreement was established, no one would dare mess with Monica.\nMonica Everett, the [Silent Witch], was a benefactor to all who lived in the territory of Count Kerbeck.\nWhen the presence of the black dragon was discovered in her territory, all the people living in the Count's territory mourned in despair.\nFor humans, dragons represent a disaster. And the most feared of them all is the black dragon.\nThe black dragon's scales are said to repel all sorts of magic, and the flames it spits out are the flames of the underworld, burning away even defensive barriers. Legend has it that a single black dragon could destroy an entire country.\nEven a fire breathed out by a black dragon on a whim could kill dozens or hundreds of people.\nThe flames of the black dragon burned through iron and stone, leaving not even the bones of a human being.\nStill, both Isabelle and Agatha had resolved to stay in the mansion until the end. Death was something they were prepared for.\nBut the report that came from the battlefield was…\n—With the help of the Silent Witch's spells, we shot down 24 wyverns. The black dragon was defeated.\nThe [Silent Witch] used a spell to wipe out the wyverns that had been gathered in one place by the dragon knights and then she proceeded to the nest of the black dragon to fight it. Although she was unable to finish the black dragon off, she succeeded in driving it away from Count Kerbeck's territory.\nIsabelle has understood how much effort and sacrifice it takes to defeat a single wyvern.\nWhat the [Silent Witch] has done was nothing but a miracle.\nFor the Count Kerbeck family, the [Silent Witch] was their great savior. And yet, she left Count Kerbeck's domain without accepting any hospitality.\nSo, when Louis Miller asked her to support the Silent Witch, she agreed to do everything in her power to support Monica.\nAfter returning to her own room and closing the door, Isabelle looked around her room and put her finger on her chin.\n\"Say, Agatha. We can put another bed in this room, can't we?\"\n\"Of course you can, my lady.\"\nThe clever Agatha immediately understood what Isabelle wanted.\nIsabelle humphed and clenched her fists.\n\"In that case, please arrange for a new bed immediately. Big Sister Monica will probably have to take some time off from her classes to recuperate. Unfortunately, I cannot take good care of her in the attic. I will have to ask her to come to this room under the watchful eyes of the other students.\"\n\"Certainly. I'll make arrangements as soon as possible.\"\n\"Thank you. Fufu… Sharing a room with my beloved big sister… Oh, she must have been hurt both physically and mentally by this incident, I must comfort her! Does she like romance novels? I'd be happy to lend her one of my recommended series. Ah, it would be wonderful if we could have a novel talk together… Oh, right, sleepwear! Agatha, don't forget to prepare her sleepwear! A very cute one that matches mine!\"\nIsabelle's eyes sparkled as she pleaded, and Agatha, the capable chambermaid, answered emphatically, \"Please leave it to me.\"",

      "content": "After discussing with the teacher about Caroline's punishment, Felix went to the infirmary, but there was no sign of Monica in there. Apparently, she had returned to her room in the dormitory.\nAlthough he was concerned about whether she could get back to the dormitory properly, Claudia was with her, so she wouldn't force Monica to do anything. Incidentally, that little squirrel seems to be living in the attic. Apparently, the daughter of Count Kerbeck made her do so.\nActually, I wanted to warn Miss Isabelle not to harass the little squirrel too much.\nAsking Isabelle why she was harassing Monica would mean getting into the inner workings of the Count Kerbeck family. Count Kerbeck was a large noble family who stood neutral. It would be unwise for Felix, the second prince, to meddle in their affairs.\nWell, if Miss Isabelle was the one who was tormenting Monica and making her cry, then he could be the one to spoil her.\nIt's easier to tame that little squirrel when there's an obvious bully.\nAt first, I was hoping Cyril would fill that role, but he's been so soft on Miss Norton lately.\nRegardless of his change of heart, Cyril was the first one to pick up Monica when she had to be carried to the infirmary… though he ran out of steam in the process.\nSurprisingly, Cyril might be thinking of Monica as a younger sister. After all, her own sister, Claudia, was like that.\nRecalling how the two siblings interacted with each other, Felix was chuckling as he shut the door of his room with a click. Then a white lizard crawled easily out of Felix's breast pocket.\nThe lizard slithered from Felix's body down to the ground and immediately transformed into a human form. Having taken the form of a chamberlain with light blue hair and blue eyes, Will bowed to Felix.\n\"Today was… well… quite a day, wasn't it?\"\n\"Yeah, but it's been a while since I've heard ‘her' name.\"\n\"‘her'?\"\nWill gave him a quizzical look, and Felix's lips raised slowly to form into a smile.\n\"Lady Everett, the [Silent Witch].\"\nIsabelle Norton had spoken that topic with eyes glittering in the salon.\n\"Although I didn't see it with my own eyes… I heard that [Silent Witch] shot down more than twenty wyverns that had been following the black dragon in an instant!\"\nAnyone with any knowledge of magic would frown upon that as an exaggeration.\nBut Felix knew. That Isabelle's words were not a lie.\nBecause Felix had witnessed it a few months ago.\nJust at that time, Felix was on a secret trip to the eastern region.\nHowever, the eastern region was in chaos due to the appearance of the black dragon. The roads were flooded with people who abandoned their villages and towns to evacuate, and Felix was forced to stay there.\nSince it was inconvenient for him if his identity was revealed to the people around him, he was moving away from the flow of people and unfortunately bumped into a group of wyverns moving towards him.\nThere, he saw it.\nA swarm of wyverns covered the sky.\nThe deafening, gargling cry was very aggressive and it was clear that it was on edge.\nWhenever one of the wyverns freakishly glided past a nearby house, its claws would rip off the roof and the wind pressure would break the trees.\nIt was a disaster with a will of its own. Each of the large wyverns was larger than a house. The sight of more than twenty of them flying in the sky was like a nightmare.\nBut at the very next moment, ice spears rained down from the sky. There were twenty-four of them—exactly the same number as the wyverns.\nThe ice blades, which looked like they would have taken a grown man to make a circle with his arms, all accurately pierced at the wyverns' brow.\nThe wyverns that had lost their strength were falling toward the ground in a trickle, into a village. All the inhabitants have been evacuated, leaving their house as-is.\nJust as the wyverns' bodies were about to collide with the house, it slid away as if swept away by the wind before falling softly to the empty ground.\nIt wasn't just one. All twenty-four of them fell gently and silently like wings fluttering in the wind, piling up on the wide ground.\nFelix, who had been watching from a distance, forgot to breathe and was mesmerized by the scene.\n—What a cruelly silent… yet beautiful spell.\nSince Felix was some distance away from the scene, he was unable to see the magician, but he later learned from others that the magician was one of the Seven Sages, the [Silent Witch].\nHe had seen the [Silent Witch] a few times at the ceremony. However, she always wore a hooded robe, so Felix had never seen her face.\nDespite being the youngest genius in the world, the [Silent Witch] rarely appeared in public, and among the Seven Sages, she was the most reserved and inconspicuous, nor have as impressive a record as her peer Louis Miller.\n…and yet she was such an amazing magician!\nFelix hummed as he took the key out of his pocket and unlocked the drawer to reveal a bundle of essays.\nSeeing this, Will blinked moderately.\n\"Are those papers that the Silent Witch wrote while at Minerva?\"\n\"Yeah, I asked Madame Cassandra to get it for me. These papers contain the positional coordinates and variations of very advanced magic essays.\"\nFelix trailed off there and lowered his eyebrows in slight disappointment.\n\"Right, you spirits have never been tangled in spells, have you?\"\n\"Yes, we spirits use magic with our senses… so we don't understand how to weave a formula.\"\nSpirits can use their mana as naturally as a human can pick up an object from a desk.\nHowever, it precisely because humans were not as good at using magic as spirits that they weave magic formulas and activate them as \"spells\".\n\"The principles of the [Silent Witch] Lady Everett's no-chanting spell have not been revealed, but there is no doubt that she has a very good mind. This essay was written by the [Silent Witch] when she was a student, and it can be said that the publication of this essay has changed the common sense of extensive magic. The accuracy of the magic has improved dramatically.\"\n\"…when we spirit aim at something with our attack magic, we ‘somehow' aim at it and ‘somehow' release our mana.\"\n\"Humans can't use mana with just ‘somehow.' We have to understand how it works, weave a logical formula, and use mana in the form of ‘spell'.\"\nFor example, imagine attacking an enemy with a fire spell.\nFirst, in order to create the fire, the magician must determine the temperature, size, shape, and duration of the fire…all of these things.\nFurthermore, in order to fire it to the enemy, the speed, angle, and distance must be calculated and fine-tuned to take into account the climate and wind direction.\nUnless they were accurately incorporated into the magic formula, the spells would not work properly. In the worst-case scenario, a fireball would explode at hand, causing a tragedy.\n\"Spells require a great deal of calculation. Human chanting is similar to the need for a formula in the middle of an arduous mathematical equation. Once you get used to it, you can make some omissions, but you can't just look at a complicated mathematical formula and suddenly arrive at the answer, can you? …but there's one person exception.\"\nA genius magician—without the need for chanting—can answer difficult magic formulas in an instant.\nAnd she was the [Silent Witch].\nRecalling her robes from the ceremony, Felix unconsciously raised the corner of his mouth.\n\"If I could, I'd like to see it again… her serene, beautiful magic.\"\nClosing his eyelids brought back the scene of wyverns quietly falling through the sky.\nThe wyverns had died instantly, almost without shedding any blood.\nHow merciless, how cruel, how beautiful.\nFelix clutched the [Silent Witch]'s papers onto his chest and let out a sweet exhalation.\n\"Ah, I wonder how the spell that shot down the wyverns at that time calculated the enemy's coordinate axis. Even incorporating a tracking spell, it would not be possible to accurately target the area between the eyebrows with the current performance of the tracking spells… I wouldn't be surprised if the [Silent Witch] had developed a new tracking spell, but I don't think it was a tracking spell because the ice seemed to be flying straight at that time. If so, it would mean that she accurately calculated the positions of the 24 wyverns and instantly activated her spells to pierce the space between their eyebrows, but grasping the positions of all 24 wyverns and firing her magic at the same time is unheard of. I suspect that the [Silent Witch] may have a frighteningly high level of spatial perception…\"\n\"Excuse me, Your Highness, your tea's ready.\"\n\"Oh, yeah, thanks. You can leave it there.\"\nAnd Will, who was very sincere, said with a look of sincere apology on his face. After gave a small nod at the cursory instructions and he placed his cup of tea on the table.\n\"I deeply apologize for my inability to understand what Your Highness is saying due to my lack of understanding.\"\n\"No, I apologize for getting carried away. There was no one else I could talk to about this.\"\nFelix flipped through the papers and looked over what was written in them.\nIt was a very advanced and complex essay. However, after reading the contents of the paper so many times to the point where it became a habit to fold the paper, he was able to easily remember the contents of the paper with just a quick glance. He had read it so much that he had memorized it. Many, many times.\n\"I have a feeling that Miss Isabelle Norton and I would get along well as fans of the [Silent Witch].\"\nWhen Felix assured him that he was a fan, Will advised him with a complicated look.\n\"Your Highness, we shouldn't be talking about the magic outside…\"\n\"I know. I'll behave myself. I'll have to pretend that I'm not familiar with magic.\"\nThat's why he hasn't taken any classes on practical spell casting at the school, and he has hidden the fact that he has made a contract with Will, a high-ranking spirit.\nSuddenly, Felix had a thought.\nThe magic formula resembled a mathematical equation—if so, what would happen if Monica Norton, who has an outstanding ability to calculate, were to learn magic?\n\"I wonder if that little squirrel has any interest in magic. I'm sure she's got some qualities.\"\n\"I don't know. But, without a certain amount of mana, she won't able to use spells.\"\n\"I guess so.\"\nFelix pondered as he looked down at the paper in his hand.\nWhat will that little squirrel think when she reads this paper?\nWell, I guess she would be more interested in these papers than in me.",

      "content": "Sitting on the fluffiest bed she's ever had and wearing a silk nightgown she's never slept in before, Monica flipped through the pages of her novel, feeling uncomfortable with the intense stares she was receiving.\nAfter reaching the last page of the book, Monica let out a breath and rubbed her tired eyes.\nAt that moment, Isabelle, who had been sitting by the bedside the whole time, spoke up with a gleam in her eye.\n\"What did you think? Marrone Fillil's masterpiece, \"The White Rose Maiden Sleeps in the Garden!\"\n\"W-Well…\"\nMonica was at a loss for words to reply, letting her gaze wander around.\n\"T-The phrasing is… rather unique, isn't it?\"\n\"Indeed, Marrone Fillil uses poetic language very beautifully, and above all, her descriptions of the scenes and the heroine's psychology are wonderful. The story is superb, too. The parting scene in the third unforgettable, and you can't read it without shedding tears.\"\nMonica, who had read that very third chapter without tears, felt very sorry for her.\nMonica, who has not been used to reading stories since her childhood, has difficulty understanding this kind of unique expression in fictional stories.\nFor example, white skin as smooth as white porcelain, black hair like melted ebony dusted with jewels, and lips as fresh as wild strawberries, all of which would be fine with just ‘white skin, black hair, and red lips.'\nBut still, she could not bring herself to deny what was recommended to her, so she smiled vaguely while giving some feedback.\nThen Isabelle's chambermaid, Agatha, spoke softly to her.\n\"My lady, it is almost time for dinner.\"\n\"Oh my, it's already time for dinner. Well then, Big Sister Monica, I will be leaving for the dining hall in a little while. I'll have Agatha prepare a meal for you.\"\n\"T-Thank you.\"\nAs she thanked her, Monica let out a sigh of relief.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAfter getting drugged by Miss Caroline and sent to the infirmary, Monica took a few days off from class to recuperate in Isabelle's room.\nMonica didn't mind being in the attic, but Isabelle had already brought a bed into her room for her, so she could not refuse.\nTo be honest, Monica, who was not used to living with other people, couldn't help but feel restless, but her chambermaid, Agatha, dealt with the situation skillfully. Whenever Isabelle got too excited, Agatha would subtly correct her.\nEven now, Agatha ushered Isabelle into the dining room and brought Monica a tray with food on it.\n\"I'll leave your meal over here. Please ring this bell when you are done.\"\n\"T-Thank you…\"\nAgatha smiled, bowed, and left the room.\nShe appreciated the concern, knowing that Monica was not used to eating in a public place.\nMonica climbed out of bed and sat down in a chair. On the table were soft bread, cheese, sauteed fish, potage, and sweetened apples.\nAgatha had gone to the trouble of preparing all of them for Monica in the dining room. Grateful for Isabelle's and Agatha's thoughtfulness, Monica sliced a piece of bread and brought it to her mouth. The fluffy white bread was soft with a slight sweetness.\nSuch soft bread was not something she could eat very often in the mountains. The one Monica was eating at the cabin was black bread hard as a stone. It was delicious when eaten with cheese, though.\nAs she chewed on the bread and reminisced about her life in the cabin, she heard the sound of scratchings on the window. Looking over, it was actually Nero scratching at the window.\nMonica stood up and opened the window, allowing Nero to easily enter the room before he twitch his nose.\n\"It smells good.\"\n\"I have some fish. You want some?\"\n\"I don't like fish, you know. I prefer meat. I like birds, especially birds.\"\nAs soon as Nero jumped up on the desk and saw that there was no meat, he frowned in frustration and said, \"These cheese will do for now.\"\nOnce she placed a small plate of cheese in front of Nero, he took a bite of the cheese, seeming to really like the taste.\n\"It's so good. Now if we could only get some meat, it would be perfect. Hey, I think I'll go hunting again tonight.\"\n\"After all the fuss over the bird bone stuck in your throat?\"\n\"That was just a youthful indiscretion. Wise creatures grow day by day by repeating mistakes like that.\"\nNero nodded plausibly and wagged his tail when he noticed that there was a novel on Monica's bedside table.\n\"It's unusual for you to read a novel… oh, I get it. The ‘orange rolls' recommended it to you, didn't she?\"\n\"You're being rude to Lady Isabelle.\"\nThe orange rolls must be referring to Isabelle's hair. Nero basically never tried to remember people's names.\nDespite Monica's protests, Nero was still gazing at the cover of the novel as he bit into a piece of cheese.\n\"That's a writer I don't know. Hey, was that novel interesting?\"\n\"…I wasn't sure.\"\n\"How's the story?\"\nLooking at Nero's curious eyes, Monica tore off a piece of bread as she ruminated on the story she had just finished reading.\n\"…There was a man and a woman.\"\n\"Okay.\"\n\"…a lot of things happened.\"\n\"Oho…\"\n\"…they're getting married.\"\n\"Then?\"\n\"…the end.\"\nNero's tail stopped moving and he stared up at Monica.\n\"I understand now that you weren't ooooone bit impressed by that novel. But, that ‘a lot of things happened' part is what's important. You've omitted hundreds of thousands of words.\"\n\"Because I really didn't know any of this…\"\nThat novel told the story of the unfortunate heroine who meets a young nobleman by a rose tree and falls in love with him at first sight. However, the young man had a fiancee. When his fiancee refuses to acknowledge the breakup of the engagement, she schemes to get rid of the heroine, but the two overcome their ordeal and end up together.\nHowever, Monica can't understand why the heroine and the young nobleman fell in love, in the first place. The young man had a fiancee, so the fiancee had every right to be furious.\n\"…how could she become so infatuated over someone like this?\"\nThe characters in the story were infatuated with the other person as if they were drowning. They were madly in love with each other. They want to love and be loved. They want to choose or want to be chosen…no matter how much it costs them.\nThis seemed somewhat frightening to Monica.\n\"…How can someone expect so much… from another person?\"\nNero's tail wagged in response to the muttering, and he looked up at Monica with golden eyes.\n\"I guess you're too young to understand. Love is like, when you fall, your heart skips a beat. Like, a zap.\"\nMonica stared at Nero, who said with a knowing look on his face.\n\"…so, do you know what \"love\" is, Nero?\"\n\"Of course I am. I like females with sexy tails, by the way.\"\n\"…tail?\"\n\"I can't lust after a female without a tail, so you're out of my scope. So don't worry.\"\nIt was a world that Monica, who had no tail, could not understand.\nMaybe, just like Monica herself didn't have a tail, she didn't have any interest in love in the first place.\nSatisfied with that conclusion, Monica tore off a piece of bread and stuffed it into her mouth.\nIt's a matter of not knowing what love is. The timid Monica can't hope for anyone or anything. She can't expect anything. What she wanted madly was just a number that would never betray her.",

      "content": "The Ashley family has been known as the \"Knowledgeable Family\" for generations, but they originally were a family of librarians.\nPerhaps as a remnant of their legacy, the Ashley family owned a library and three study rooms. The number of books in the library was no less than the library in the royal capital.\nClaudia who growing up surrounded by such an enormous amount of books, naturally would read them in her spare time.\nThe adults around her called her a book-loving girl, but Claudia wasn't particularly fond of reading. She has a slightly different hobby.\nFor Claudia, the act of reading a book was a \"natural act\".\nJust as eating when hungry, she reads books when she doesn't know something. That was all there was to it. And for that reason, Claudia thought the act of reading no more than that.\nThe same can be said for the rest of Ashley's family members. And Claudia's father was no exception.\nTherefore, her knowledgeable father, Marquis Highon, was visited every day by those who sought his advice. Some were representing their own people, some were local nobles… and some were from other countries.\n—I'm in trouble because my fields are not yielding. Please tell me how to grow more crops even in a drought.\n—It's about inheritance property control, please tell me how to get an upper hand over my brother.\n—A sailor became ill during a voyage. Please tell me how to treat it.\nEveryone was clinging onto her father, saying, ‘Please tell me, please tell me.'\nAs she watched such scenes, the child Claudia thought to herself.\nWhy do these people never try to figure things out for themselves?\nMost of the questions they brought up were things that could be found in a book. No one ever bothered to figure it out themselves. They only want to know the answer.\nClaudia was experiencing the same things as well. In her primary school, people would come to Claudia to ask her about things they didn't understand.\nTreating her like nothing more than a ‘walking library,' everyone also thought of all the Ashley family members was like that.\nIt would be worst when they felt grateful to her. After they felt grateful for Claudia because she could be relied upon, they would back to ask on her again, and again. That's why Claudia despised their gratitude.\nSo, when people tried to talk to her, Claudia would show her gloomy face as if she didn't feel like talking to them. Its gloomy was like that of a person who seemed to have one of her family members died.\nIts effect was so great making no one came near Claudia after, leaving her with plenty time to read a book quietly.\nClaudia was truly happy about that.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nOne day, a letter arrived at her father's door.\nA certain baron wanted to visit her father to ask for his advice on something.\nAfter her father read the letter, his face was expressionless but somewhat jubilant, she sure for it. He even arranged for the servants to prepare a reception for that person.\n\"…who's our guest today?\"\nAfter begin asked by Claudia, her father lifted his glasses and spoke up.\n\"Baron Maywood would like to discuss something with me.\"\n\"…He's come to ask some advice, isn't he? But you seem quite enthused about it, even arranged the servants to receive that person.\"\nIn response to his daughter's bitter remark, her father muttered, \"I see,\" as he expected her reply.\nTo an outsider, he may look cold and impassive, but to his family, his excitement was apparent. The corners of his mouth were slightly raised under his well-trimmed beard.\n\"Baron Maywood always comes to me for advice when he's done looking everything within his means before seeking a different point of view. He's not come to seek for my ‘knowledge', but my ‘opinion'.\"\nThe wine I drink always tastes better when I've him accompanied me\n, said her father, concluding the story.\nClaudia knew that her father did not like to drink very much.\nTo be able to make such a father enjoying his drink, Baron Maywood must be an outstanding man like no other, she thought at the time.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"Well, it's nice to see you, Marquis Highon. It's been a long time. Oh, is that Miss Claudia over there? She looks very lovely.\"\nClaudia's first impression of Baron Maywood was one word: ‘plain.'\nHe appeared to be younger than her father, and his clothes were plain with few ornaments. He probably a baron who wasn't from a wealthy family.\nThe smile on his face was somewhat unreliable with his relaxed eyebrows, making him look amicably and not very smart.\n\"I brought my son with me today. Neil, introduce yourself.\"\nAs Baron Maywood urged, a small boy stepped out from behind, looked straight up at Marquis Highon with a shy smile, then greeted him.\n\"My name is Neil Clay Maywood, eldest son of Baron Maywood. It is an honor to meet you.\"\nHe was a boy with straight eyes. Though he only appeared to be about ten years old, he was said to be thirteen, the same age as Claudia. Apparently, looking young was their family trait.\nUshered into the parlor by Claudia's father which was Marquis Highon, together with Baron Maywood, had a brief discussion. The topic was mainly about the mediation between the Magician's Association and the Noble Council. Apparently, the Magician's Association has requested the council to lift the ban on medical spells.\nAnd Baron Maywood's tasked to arbitrate the meeting.\nFor generations, the Baron Maywood family has been involved mainly in mediating these kinds of negotiations.\nIf the Marquis Highon family was known as the ‘knowledgeable family,' then Baron Maywood's family was known as the ‘mediator family.'\nDespite his position as a noble, a mediator's job is to guide the two sides of the debate to reach a satisfactory settlement in an impartial manner, without taking sides with the noble council.\n\"Lifting the ban on medical spells would certainly save some lives. That's a fact. However, in my opinion, it is still ‘too early.' We need both medical and spells research development to reach the same level of maturity… but, medical development in this country is not mature yet.\"\n\"I agree. In some areas, there are still doctors who use superstition as a form of medicine. Lifting the ban on medical spells in this situation will only add to the actions of such frauds.\"\n\"First of all, the bad effect of mana in the human body… I think we need to do more verification of that. The data we've collected on the part of the Magician's Association is still insufficient. If things continue like this, the medical development may be eclipsed by the magic development.\"\n\"Definitely. On top of that, we should train those who are proficient in both medicine and spells. I am certain medical spells will be developing in the future, but at the moment, the foundation for it has not even been laid. So, we should concentrate on cultivating the soil.\"\n\"You are right. However, hearing someone has a family member with a disease that is untreatable by today's medical treatment… tend to make me get emotional in mediating… ‘The ban on medical spells should be lifted as soon as possible. Are you trying to kill my daughter?' when someone said that, it made me felt so depressed… I understand how painful it is to feel that way.\"\n\"If the wrong method of treatment caused mana poisoning and led her to death, there would be no saving the child.\"\n\"Yeah, that's why we should proceed more carefully.\"\nAs she quietly listened to the conversation between her father and Baron Maywood, Baron Maywood turned his head and looked at Claudia.\nHe then relaxed his eyebrows and smiled wryly.\n\"Sorry, that wasn't very interesting, was it?\"\n\"No, I found it very interesting… I can tell the arguments of the magicians, who are trying to push their case based on emotionalism without sufficient data, and the noble council, who are concerned that the interests of the medical association will flow into the magicians if doctors and magicians team up.\"\nBaron Maywood rounded his eyes slightly at Claudia's words. However, he didn't seem particularly offended, and rather calmly relaxing his eyebrows and smiled.\n\"You're very clever. Indeed. It precisely because of that I need to proceed more carefully… before making my decision.\"\nNeil, who was sitting next to Baron Maywood, rounded his eyes and looked at Claudia. He must have been taken aback by Claudia's statement.\nI don't know how much that little boy with the young face understands my words…he even might not able to understand everything.\nAs Claudia was thinking about this, her father glanced at her and said in a low voice.\n\"Claudia. Go give young Neil a tour of our mansion.\"\nHer father probably thought Claudia was bored, too.\nShe suspected the topics they would talk about would be things that can't be heard by children.\n\"Um, please treat me well!\"\n\"………\"\nThis is like I've become a person who's showing the way for children\n, Claudia thought to herself.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\" …Any place do you want to see?\"\n\"Um, I want to see your garden.\"\n\"Okay…\"\nFor him being interested in gardens rather than books in the Ashley family—which boasts such a large collection of books—was quite unusual.\nClaudia led Neil into the garden, secretly thinking that it would be easier for her if he would just stay quiet and read a book.\nHaving walked next to each other for a while, she found him looked even younger. He was a little shorter than Claudia and his appearance didn't match his age.\nNoticing Claudia was giving him a side glance, Neil then responded with a smile which much like his father.\n\"You are amazing, Miss Claudia. You even grasped the true meaning behind such a difficult event.\"\n\"………\"\n\"I haven't thought about the reason behind the noble council. I didn't expect the Medical Association and the noble council have a strong connection… My father let me present to be the meeting was to study, but I'm not ready yet…\"\n\"………\"\nApparently, he barely able to grasp the meaning behind their fathers were discussion.\nNeil folded his arms groaning with a difficult face.\n\"I wonder if there was any proof that clearly shows the connection between the Noble Council and the Medical Association… the current head of the Medical Association is… um…\"\nNeil was groaning as question after question came from him, never once asked about them to Claudia.\nUnexpectedly, Claudia opened her mouth.\n\"..you're not going to ask?\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"I am the daughter of Marquis Highon… The Knowledgeable Family. I have enough knowledge to answer most of your questions.\"\nIn fact, Claudia has all the answers to the questions that Neil had mentioned.\nHowever, Neil showed a slight sign of thinking and then shook his head firmly.\n\"No, I will look it up when I get home. ‘If you don't know something, you should look it up yourself. If you still can't figure it out, ask someone who can.' that's what my father told me.\"\n\"…alright.\"\n\"Oh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry for refusing while you've intended to answer my questions, but…\"\nClaudia didn't say she would answer his questions. She just said that she knew the answer.\nHowever, this apparently good-natured boy seemed to have interpreted Claudia's statement as one of the good intentions.\n\"I'm going to do some investigation at home, so if I still don't understand, please do tell me.\"\nClaudia did not confirm or deny. It wasn't that she was being mean. It was because she couldn't decide which was the best response.\nIf she told him ‘there's no way I would give you my answer,' or something in a cold tone, perhaps that boy will never visit her again. And she felt like she would regret it later.\nOpened the door without a word, Claudia was walking straight down the well-marked path.\n\"…we've arrived in our garden.\"\n\"Wow, there's a lot of medical herbs.\"\nMarquis Highon family has half of his garden planted with ornamental flowers and half with medicinal herbs. While the latter was grown by her father as a way to put into practice his book knowledge on medicinal herbs. Her father was a man who believed that this kind of knowledge was only valuable if it was put into practice.\nMarquis Highon has air that man of a taciturn knowledgeable man, but he was surprisingly a man of action.\n\"Look at this, Miss Claudia. This herb, it's the kind that helps with cut wounds!\"\n\"…how could I possibly not know?\"\n\"Well, you're right.\"\nScratching his cheek in embarrassment, Neil crouched down on the spot and reached for a weed growing outside the flower bed.\n\"Then do you what is this?\"\n\"…it's weeds.\"\nShe could even tell him its scientific name if he wanted. Along with its habitats, too.\nIn front of the thinking Claudia, Neil plucked a weed and snapped both its edges, put it in his mouth then blew on it.\n*whistle* A high-pitched sounded.\n\"If you cut this grass here and squeeze this area, you can make whistles. Our shepherds often do this.\"\n\"…I've never heard about it before.\"\nAs Claudia spoke quietly, Neil giggled and blew his grass flute happily.\nThe sound was high, clear, and pleasant.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAs soon as Baron Maywood and his son went out to return to their home, Claudia immediately made an announcement to her father.\n\"Father, I would like to marry Neil.\"\nClaudia said this with her usual gloomy air, but Marquis Highon neither surprised nor scolded her, simply stared at her in silence.\nAfter staring at each other in silence for a while, Marquis Highon slowly opened his mouth.\n\"Neil is the eldest son who will inherit the Maywood family, so I can't make him come to our house as my son-in-law.\"\nClaudia thought her father would continue with his denial thereafter, but when he playing with his mustache, he blurted out.\n\"I guess I would have to adopt a son to take over the family.\"\nClaudia's mother died soon after giving birth to Claudia, and her father never took a second wife, so at this point, Claudia was the only person in the direct line of the Marquis Highon family.\nCertainly, if he adopted the son who would succeed the Marquis Highon family, Claudia would be able to marry Neil off without any problems. However, she knew her father wished to have come into his house as his son-in-law.\n\"So you do not disagree with it…\"\n\"I know you'll come to love him..\"\nThe words that her father said as he tried to hold his tongue were filled with a strange sense of reality. Indeed, both father and daughter have a weakness for the Baron Maywood family.\nMarquis Highon did not mention the fact that the blood of the direct lineage of the Knowledgeable Family would be cut off. He also knew that blood does not leave knowledge, but memory does.\n\"Now, I should make some arrangements for an adoption… I'd like him to be a person who's desire to improve oneself, even if he's from a distant family.\"\nAfter saying this, Marquis Highon took out one document after another from his writing desk.\nClaudia, the daughter, wanted to marry him the next day after the meeting, and her father, who heard her daughter yearning for that marriage of a sudden, immediately started preparing documents for adoption and engagement.\nLike the father like the daughter, their quick decisions were so similar.",

      "content": "It had been a week since Monica had been recuperating in Isabelle's room. Now her physical condition has improved, she decided to return to her room in the attic as before.\nWhy not continue to stay in her room, so Isabelle suggested, but Monica refused since she was carrying out a secret mission.\n\"Let's go, Monica. I'll lead the way. Follow me when I give the signal.\"\n\"Yeah…\"\nNero went ahead to make sure no one was around, and when he gave the signal, Monica crept her way across the corridor.\nAt night in the girls' dormitory, several supervisors would take turns keeping watch around. In the pretense of emergencies or intruders, but in reality, it's to keep an eye on the students who are planning to have a night out.\nMonica asked Nero to keep an eye out for her to avoid being spotted as she carefully made her way to the attic.\nShe's almost got caught a few times on her way there, but thanks to Nero, she made it to reach the attic without being spotted, then climbed up the old ladder to the top and pushed up the door.\nThen, she heard a clacking sound.\nThe door hit something when she pushed it up… it was a small, thin, rectangular piece of wood. The wooden pieces arranged at equal intervals were placed in such a way that their tips would collide with each other when the door pushed up.\nAfter Monica opened up the door, the evenly spaced pieces of wood dropped one after another following by clicking sounds. At the end of it stood a quill pen that was propped up against the ink pot, barely vertical.\nAs the quill was pushed down by the piece of wood, the tip of the quill grazed the top of a can set up nearby.\nThe round stone that was placed on top of the can was sliding across the measuring stick like a slide. At the end of the way down was one tip of the scales of the balance. When a pebble fell on it, the scale tilted, and on the top of the lifted scale was a piece of paper that said ‘Goal!' written on…\nA distracting whistle sound came from above the stunned Monica and Nero: toot-toot, toot-toot, toot-toot!\nAs they looked up, they saw a beautiful woman in a maid's uniform—Louis Miller's contracted spirit—Lynn, standing inside the attic, looking down expressionlessly at Monica and her group coming up, with a flute in her mouth.\nLynn swooped down to the floor in a weightless motion, picked up the hem of her skirt, and bowed gracefully.\n\"Welcome back, Miss [Silent Witch], Sir Black Cat.\"\n\"…Um, Miss, Lynn…?\"\n\"Indeed. This one is the very contracted high spirit of Louis Miller, Lyndberghfield.\"\nSpoke the beautiful, doll-like expressionless face with the usual indifferent voice.\nAnd yet, the flute in her mouth stood out in contrast to her action. How does she vocalize her voice?\nNero seemed to be curious about the trick that was triggered when the door opened, and when he saw how the pieces of wood set up, he was impressed and said, \"Wow, this is amazing.\"\nIn response, Lynn expressionlessly nodded somewhat proud.\n\"This is a huge work that took me 2,174 failed attempts and 62 hours of work (including gathering materials). It was not easy to cut these pieces of wood to the same size.\"\n\"Um… what's this… for…?\" said Monica after managed to squeeze her words, which was responded by Lynn with a serious tone.\n\"It was approximately 72 hours ago when I arrived in this room to receive the regular report. The task of waiting for your return in this place has left me so bored.\"\nIn other words, Lynn had been waiting for Monica in this attic for three days, while diligently scraping and arranging pieces of wood.\nAs Monica paled at the guilt she had felt after leaving her for so long, Nero spoke up in exasperation.\n\"Don't let her words fooled you, Monica. Spirits wouldn't get bored in just three days. Their sense of time was different from humans\"\n\"…now that you mention it, you're right, I suppose.\"\nNero, who had tasted the deliciousness of human food and the enjoyment of novels ever since became her familiar, nodded in agreement.\nAfter quickly cleaned up the pieces of wood scattered on the floor, Lynn looked at Monica as if she has finally remembered her main objective.\n\"So, where have you been for the past few days?\"\n\"Well, I apologize for that… for the past week, I've been staying in Lady Isabelle's room… After being poisoned, I've been recuperating there…\"\nAs Monica fidgeting her finger trying to explain her circumstance, Lynn bent her head to the side. She's probably trying to tilt her head, but what she's done looked so creepy.\n\"I wonder how could you, the Silent Witch, who should escort His Highness, be poisoned.\"\n\"…I would like to know too.\"\nShe also wanted to know the answer.\nRecalling her recent event for the past month and a half, she's become a member of the student council as soon as she transferred to the school, having her tea leaves dumped on her during the tea ceremony class, and was nearly poisoned by a classmate.\n\"I have heard that there will be a school festival next month.\"\n\"Well… yeah…\"\n\"Since many outsiders will be coming in, the attempts to assassinate the second prince will be increased too. Sir Louis also left some advice, please keep your guard up.\"\n\"I-I will.\"\nMonica steeled her resolve once again. That's right, her recent surrounding events had made her forgot that Felix's life has always been surrounded by danger.\nAs Monica thought\n, I have to pull myself together\n, in her mind, Nero looked up nudged at her.\n\"I've been thinking this for a while. If you want to assassinate the prince, why don't you just fire a large magic weapon at this school? Wouldn't that be easier?\"\n\"…Nero, if you do that, it wouldn't be called assassination anymore…\"\nIf they really planned to do that on that scale, it would like to be declaring war.\nThat thought recalled back her memories when Louis told her about some of his stories.\n\"I think you don't have to worry about people attacking from the outside… After all, this school had been protected by a barrier covering around.\"\n\"Is that so?\"\n\"It is. And most of the major facilities in this kingdom have been protected by the barrier created by Louis.\".\nLouis Miller has another alias which was the [Barrier Magician]… Although he's widely known for his martial artist, his specialty was creating a barrier. Its strength, scale, precision, and duration said to be unrivaled by anyone.\nAnd\nthat\nLouis has put a lot of effort and time into a large-scale barrier that covered this school.\n\"…I think he's set up a barrier for defense then combined it with a detection magic formula. Usually, it would remain in a dormant state, but when it detects an attack from the outside, the barrier would activate… As long as we have Louis's barrier, an attack from the outside would be the last thing to concern about.\"\nFor that reason, the thing she should worry about was an assassination from the inside.\nThe barrier that Louis set up can defend against an attack from the outside, but it can't do anything to the things that happened inside.\nI need to act more carefully\n, as Monica told herself so…\n\"I guess we need to think of a plan during the school festival. Lynn, could you wait for a moment. I will write the regular report now…\"\nAs Monica turned to her desk, picked up her quill, Lynn clapped her hands together as if she had remembered something, and began rummaging through the pockets of her maid's uniform.\n\"Miss [Silent Witch], while you were away, a few secret letters had arrived in this attic.\"\n\"…Secret letters?\"\n\"Yes, since it had been slipped in between the gaps of the door, I was able to retrieve it. Here.\"\nWhat Lynn presented to her was a simple piece of paper folded in half.\nLeaving her body to stiffen as the nervousness growing up.\nShe recalled the thing that happened a long time ago before she enrolled into Minerva, where some ill-words written on the letters slipped into her room. Such horrible words like ‘go to hell' or ‘get out from Minerva'.\nImagining such thoughts, Monica unfolded the paper with her trembling fingers.\n\"………ah.\"\nWhat's written there was the change of her period class and the things that should be brought in which shaped in rounded fonts. And it ended with one sentence of ‘you should get better quickly.'\nAlthough there's no name on it, from that handwritings, she knew the senders… and it was Lana. Looking at the number sheets of the papers, she speculated Lana had sent one letter every day for the past week.\nAnd the letter that arrived recently has ‘there will be course selection in the school tomorrow, so you must come for sure!' written on.\nMonica couldn't help but raise her mouth as she covered her red face with both hands.\n\"………Eh-heh.\"\nAfter re-reading the letters one by one carefully, she put them inside her drawer—where she had put her precious coffee pot in—then locked it.",

      "content": "After returning from her recuperation, she's been attending the class for a whole week, and for the first time, she was going to eat her lunch at the cafeteria.\nSince Casey, who from the next class, had taken the trouble inviting Monica to have lunch together and Lana's also going to tag along, Monica nervously accepted her invitation with a nod.\nSpeaking of the school cafeteria, all she could remember was the school cafeteria at Magician Training Institute Minerva where she's been enrolled into.\nMinerva had a system where the students choose the menu at the reception desk to get a wooden tag after paid the bill upfront. Which later brought to the counter to exchange for a meal of the chosen menu. The menu selections changed daily by three different sets of meals, and additional bread and soup were available for an extra charge.\nAs such, she thought that the cafeteria at Serendia Academy would also have such a system, but it was very different from what she had imagined.\nTo put it simply, the school cafeteria of Serendia Academy was a high-class restaurant. Once the students stepped into the cafeteria, they would be guided by waiters into seats, given a brief explanation on the menu, and had their meals brought onto their table.\nThe students were not required to pay, since all of the cost has been included in the school fees.\nThe best thing was one could even request their meals delivered directly to their own room in the dorm.\nT-This is so amazing…\nEven at Minerva where Monica's enrolled which many of the students came from nobilities had provided many facilities, it still can't be compared to what Serendia Academy had. Everything here looked so extravagant.\nMonica felt restless at the unused cafeteria while being escorted by the waiters to her seat before quietly sat down next to someone. She's been looking down until now, so she thought the ones who sat at the table were only Lana and Casey, but when she raised her face, she saw them sat across the table.\n…then, who's the person sat next to her?\nAwkwardly turning her head, She met the gaze of Claudia Ashley's beautiful blue lapis lazuli eyes.\n\"Wait, why are you sitting there too?!\"\nLana yelled at Claudia in angry, but only to be brushed nonchalantly before Claudia's getting closer to Monica.\n\"…oh my, aren't we friends, Mo.Ni.Ca?\"\nMonica's whole body stiffened as she let out faint voices.\nClaudia stroked Monica's cheek with her white-gloved fingertips. For some reason, she felt as if a snake was crawling on her skin.\n\"…Monica, I did save your life, didn't I?\"\n\"Y-You did.\"\n\"…you do appreciate what I did for you, don't you?\"\n\"…I-I do.\"\n\"…then we're friends, aren't we?\"\n\"Y-Yeah.\"\nAfter convinced the stiffly nodding Monica to agree, Claudia smiled triumphantly.\nWhile Lana's vein popped up on her forehead.\n\"That's just coercing!\"\nAnd Casey was \"now, now\" tried to calm down the angry Lana.\n\"Come on, let's stop this edgy atmosphere and talk more calmly, shall we?\"\n\"…oh, please, I don't intend to make the atmosphere this edgy. It just the girl over there making a fuss all by herself… right?\"\nLana gritted her teeth at Claudia's obviously provocative tone.\nCasey looked at them both in turn with an exasperated expression.\n\"You two, please let Monica choose her own food. Oh, Monica. I recommend this fried fish. It comes with a delicious special sauce.\"\n\"Also, this and this…\"\nTo tell the truth, Monica, who earned a good income as a Seventh Sage, was not troubled by money. Therefore, she didn't mind any of the dishes on the menu. In fact, since she didn't know much about food, she would be very grateful if someone could recommend something for her.\nWhen everyone had finished ordering, Casey opened his mouth to mediate the delicate atmosphere.\n\"Say, we are going to observe the elective course this afternoon, right? Have you guys decided which course you want to take yet?\"\nSince the start of the second year of high school, the students could take elective courses in addition to the regular basic courses. Among more than twenty courses, they can choose two to take.\nHorseback riding, sword fighting, and spear fighting were popular among boys. Musical performance, embroidery, and poetry were popular among girls. Other courses such as sociology, herbology, and foreign languages were also available for both boys and girls.\nWith such a wide variety of courses to choose from, Monica still hadn't decided which one she wanted to take. It would have been nice to have something like advanced mathematics, but there was only basic math in the academic subjects.\nAs Monica clammed up, Lana opened her mouth.\n\"I would perhaps choose musical performance course, but considering my future, I would also like to learn two languages. Maybe if I learn some languages, especially Southern Continent Commercial and Ouka, I could be useful for my father's work.\"\n\"How wonderful. I think I'll go for embroidery… that's the only thing I'm good at. I'll hold off on the other one. What about you, Miss Claudia?\"\nCasey casually swung the conversation to Claudia, and Claudia said with a gloomy smile on her beautiful face.\n\"Herbology and basic spell casting… might come in handy to shut those idiots up, don't you think?\"\nCasey hoped Claudia doesn't say things like that with an evil smile, as if having already poisoned a few people.\nAs for Monica, who was saved by Claudia's emergency treatment a week ago, she couldn't say anything about it.\n\"Have you decided yet, Monica?\"\nAsked by Lana, Monica was stuck for words.\nSerendia Academy offered a strong curriculum in languages, law, and liberal arts, but was somewhat weak in areas such as advanced mathematics, physics, and biology.\nIn other words, subjects in which Monica excels were few and far between.\nWhen it comes to basic spells casting, she definitely excelled at it…\n…I can't even say that my magic formula is listed in a basic spells textbook…\nBeing too good at magic-related matters, on the other hand, would likely get her into trouble.\n\"…I haven't… decided… at all… yet.\"\nMonica answered while kneading her fingers, which made Casey grin.\n\"So, how about you come with me to look around the courses? I haven't decided on one yet, and hopefully, I could get to know some new courses that I wouldn't normally encounter.\"\n\"…please guide me well…\"\nWhen it came to observing the courses, it was natural that she would run into a group of people she had never met before. For Monica, who was very uncomfortable with this, Casey's offer was very much appreciated.\nAs she patted her chest in relief, the waiter brought the meal to her. In front of Monica was a beautifully colored fried fish, salad, bread, and soup lined on her table.\nCasey, who ordered the same thing, split the bread in two with a beaming face, put the vegetables and fries between them, and took a big bite.\nWhen Claudia saw the way she was eating, her brow furrowed.\n\"…that is how the laborers eat.\"\n\"At home, we all eat like this. When we took rest after farming.\"\nCasey didn't care if Claudia looked dumbfounded or not. That kind of strength to not care about the eyes of the people around her was something Monica envied.\nCasey gulped down a piece of bread and wiped her mouth with a napkin before saying.\n\"Besides, in my hometown, nobles and workers are equal. We all have to work together to get food.\"\n\"So, how did you end up at this school?\"\n\"I don't mind if you say, ‘How could a poor aristocrat pay for school?' In fact, that's what I think.\"\nInstead of being menial, Casey spoke casually.\nShe probably didn't think of her circumstances as unfortunate.\n\"I was really lucky to get into Serendia Academy. A kind person with whom we have a connection has offered to help us. My father says I should go and meet His Highness, but… You know, I'm sure your father will tell you this at least once. Like ‘Go catch His Highness' eye' or something.\"\nClaudia and Lana shook their heads at Casey's blurting.\n\"…I have a fiance.\"\n\"My father was like, ‘What if my pretty Lana catches His Highness' eye?' Well, it's unlikely, isn't it?\"\nAt their words, Casey muttered, \"I envy you…\" and then glanced at Monica.\n\"What about you, Monica?\"\n\"Oh… huh?\"\n\"Has anyone ever told you that? That you should catch the attention of His Highness.\"\nMonica was at a loss for words. If anything, it was Monica's duty to escort his highness.\n\"Well… uh… I'm afraid so…\"\nBarely answering that, Casey didn't seem to be particularly bothered by it and gave an ‘I see,' and then took another bite of bread.",

      "content": "Normally, the elective courses at Serendia Academy are conducted by all three grades.\nHowever, only the third-year students were given elective courses at the beginning of the new semester, about a month and a half earlier than the first and second-year students.\nToday's observation tour will mainly consist of freshmen and sophomores freely observing the classroom of third graders.\nSince Lana and Claudia had already decided on the course they wanted to take, they each went off to observe their own courses.\nMonica, who hasn't decided on one yet, was in the middle of touring each classroom with Casey, who had invited her to join her during lunch.\nAs she walked, Monica looked over the handouts she had been given in advance. Reading it over again, she was amazed at the variety of courses offered.\nAt Minerva, where she used to enroll, had all courses related to magic except for the basic education courses, so she had never had to worry about this much.\nAs Monica nodded in understanding, Casey, walking next to her, opened her mouth.\n\"I guess swordsmanship and equestrian courses are the most popular among boys. Especially with equestrian, since there are only so many horses available, it's often going to end up in a lottery. To tell you the truth, I took the equestrian course last year, too. And I was lucky enough to win the lottery.\"\n\"Y-You're able to ride a horse, Casey?\"\nAs Monica rounded her eyes, Casey brushed it with a laugh as if it was no big deal.\n\"All the men and women in my hometown knew to ride a horse. I used to accompany my father on his long rides. I even join him on a hunt sometimes with my crossbow.\"\nFor a wealthy noble, hunting was just another form of entertainment. But to Casey, it's one way of earning a living.\nCasey was amazing, Monica thought honestly.\nShe was energetic and capable of doing things. She was also good at cooking and embroidery. In her hometown, she used to do embroideries on days when the weather was bad and sell them to make a living.\nEven without a maidservant, she had no difficulty in taking care of herself and had a good capability for living.\nAs Monica looked up at Casey with admiration, Casey scratched her head uncomfortably. This kind of unladylike gesture was really a part of her.\n\"Aw, please stop complimenting me like that, it's really embarrassing. I am not that great at all. We've always been poor because our land often heavily damaged by dragons, so we couldn't eat unless we've got skills like that.\"\n\"B-But, you're able to keep up your grades, on general academic courses.\"\nWhether it was tea party class or ballroom dancing class, Casey's grades were never bad.\nIt was a far cry from Monica's almost catastrophic grades in everything but math.\n\"No, I'm just know all of them a bit.\"\n\"Haha,\" Casey gave a wry laugh before glancing at the handout in Monica's hand.\n\"But now that I have the opportunity to enroll at Serendia Academy, I'd like to learn things that I can't learn back home. For example… is this course.\"\nCasey then pointed to the text in the handout.\nLooking at the words, Monica rounded her eyes. Casey pointed to the \"practical magic\" course.\n\"I'm a little curious about practicing magic myself. In my hometown, we rarely see magicians. Are you interested in it, Monica?\"\n\"Huh? Noooo, I just…\"\nIf anything, Monica was actually one of the best magicians in the kingdom, one of the Seven Sages, the Silent Witch. Of course, there is no way she could tell her that.\nIf Monica was an ordinary magician, she would have been able to take practical magic courses without hiding her true identity.\nHowever, Monica has a fatal flaw.\nMonica, who can't chant properly in public, can't chant normally—in other words, she can only use the no-chant spell.\nAnd the moment she uses a no-chant spell, Monica's true identity will be revealed. Because Monica was the only person in the world who could use a no-chant spell.\n\"I-I-I-I don't think I'm cut out for magic, so…\"\n\"Is that so? You never know until you try… Wait, Monica, you look really pale, are you okay?\"\n\"Th-that's no-not tr-true….\"\n\"Now you're just gonna let it roll off your tongue.\"\nCasey put her hands on her hips and gave her an exasperated look… then her eyes suddenly widened.\nHer gaze was not focused on Monica, but the person behind her.\n\"Hello, Miss Norton. How are you feeling now?\"\nIt was impossible to mishear his soft and gentle voice.\nLike a squeaky old spring, Monica turned around to see Felix smiling at her with a dignified smile.\n\"Y-Your… Your Highness.\"\n\"Yeah, it's been a while since I've heard that amusing phrase.\"\n\"A-About t-that matter, I-I am thrulledly grateful, for your help.\"\n\"…thrulledly…\"\nIn response to Monica's unusual comment, Felix covered his mouth with his hand as he quivered.\nOn the other hand, Casey's face stiffened and became rigid. He was the second prince that everyone adored, but being in a different grade, it was not often had the chance to meet in such close proximity, so her reaction was only natural.\nStill paying attention to Casey, Monica asked him stiffly.\n\"U-Um… W-Why are you here… Y-Your Highness.\"\n\"Some of the third-year students are helping to guide the first- and second-year students on their observation visits. Have you picked your elective courses yet, by any chance?\"\nWhen Monica was shaking her head, Felix said, \"Oh, that's a relief,\" and smiled cheerfully.\nShe had a very bad feeling about this. Whenever his highness was in a good mood, Monica would usually end up in a bad situation.\n\"I think I have a course that might be suitable for you. Allow me to show you around. Your friend can tag along.\"\nShe has especially a bad feeling about this. She had nothing but a bad feeling. However, since Felix had invited her out, there was no way Monica could refuse.\nThe already stiff-faced Casey replied, \"I-It's my pleasure.\"\nIf she knew this was going to happen, she might have just picked embroidery or musical performance at that time!\nInwardly holding her head up, Monica followed Felix helplessly.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"We've arrived.\"\nThis was the very classroom that Felix had led her to. When Monica saw the sign on the door, she bawled her eyes out. Maybe her eyes had gone a little white, maybe her heart had almost stopped.\n‘Practical Magic.'\nIt was the worst course that Monica could have chosen.\nTo Monica, who was shaking all over, Felix said with an oddly amused look.\n\"I haven't taken this particular course, but I think you might be well suited for magic.\"\n\"W-What made you think t-t-that way…?\"\nWhat made him think that way?\nFelix answered Monica's sluggish question with a simple answer.\n\"It's said that the more math-oriented one is, the better one is at magic. You've got an outstanding grade in mathematics, don't you? So I figured you'd be good at it.\"\nThat's exactly right. Monica's ability to calculate has allowed her to create numerous new magic formulas and mastered the art of no-chant spells.\nHowever, Monica absolutely could not allow herself to pick this course.\nHow can I find an excuse to leave this place?\nAs she pondered this, Felix opened the door to the classroom and called out to the teacher standing at the podium.\n\"Professor Macgregan, I've brought two candidates who wish to observe.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nThe teacher standing at the podium slowly turned around to look at their way.\nHe was a small old man with thick white eyebrows and a long beard that hid his eyes and mouth… Monica recognized him.\nWhile Monica turned pale and Casey looked curious, Felix said cheerfully.\n\"This is Professor Macgregan, the teacher in this practical magic course. Until a few years ago, he was a teacher at the most prestigious magician training institute, Minerva…\"\nP-Professor Macgregan!?\nMacgregan was the teacher who had taught Monica magic when she was a student at Minerva. Naturally, they were acquainted.\nShe had heard that Macgregan had retired from Minerva at about the same time Monica was graduating, but she never imagined that he was teaching here!\nThe words \"mission failed\" raced through Monica's head.\nI-It's over… the whole thing's been exposed…\nAs Monica stood there looking like a dead man, Macgregan said in a tone that was rather cute for his age.\n\"……Who are\nchuu\n?\"\n\"I'm Felix Ark Riddile, the student council president.\"\n\"Oh, so you're that student council president… yeah… thanks for bringing them here… uh, are you two the visitors? I'm sorry, but I don't have very good eyesight. Are\nchuu\nboys or girls?\"\n\"Both of them are girls.\"\n\"Ah, so they're girls. Yes, yes, more girls are taking this course these days.\"\nHis tone was cute for his age, and he spoke uniquely, referring to other people as \"chuu\" instead of \"you\", just as Monica remembered.\n…and also, the fact that he has trouble seeing.\nMaybe… h-he hasn't noticed?\nI still have a chance. I can still escape now.\nTo begin with, Monica came to this school not as ‘Monica Everett' but ‘Monica Norton.' Unless someone called her by her first name out loud, it was unlikely that she would be recognized as the same person…\n\"Ohhhh! Is that you, Monica? Are you picking a practical magic course too, Monica?\"\nMonica's head went total blank for a few seconds.\nAs Monica came to her senses, she was approached by Glenn Dudley, who was in high spirits today, and Neil Clay Maywood, another student council member.\nNeil greeted Felix politely when he caught sight of him.\n\"Hello, President. And Miss Norton too. Are you all going to be picking this course?\"\nFelix shook his head at Neil's words.\n\"Unfortunately, I have not taken it, but I thought it might be suitable for Miss Norton, so I was showing her and her friend around.\"\n\"What? Really? I can barely manage counting two-digit addition… Maybe I'm just not very good at it?\"\nThe fact that Glenn had also come to this classroom meant that he was planning to pick a practical magic course.\nThat reminds me, Glenn… is an apprentice magician, I think?\nGlenn has performed his flying magic several times in front of Monica. It's not an easy technique, so Glenn must have some talent.\nAs Monica was thinking about this, Macgregan cleared his throat, \"Ahem.\"\n\"Don't stand there talking at the entrance, please come and take your seat. Also, on the subject of what makes someone is suitable to become a magician and what doesn't, I'll explain it to you so that it's easier for the other students to understand.\"\nMacgregan urged Monica and the others to sit down at an empty seat.\nEven Felix, who was not a candidate, sat down next to Monica with an amused look on his face. She hoped that he could back to his job of showing the students around as quickly as possible.\n\"Okay, ahem. First of all, to become a magician, all you need is these three talents. It's ‘amount of mana', ‘ability to comprehend magic formulas', and ‘skill to manipulate mana'.\"\nMacgregan wrote the three aspects he had just mentioned on the blackboard and circled the words ‘the quantity of mana' first.\n\"Whatever you say, the most important talent is the amount of your mana. Without it, you couldn't cast any spells in the first place. Nowadays, it's easy to measure with a mana measuring tool, but to be an apprentice, you need to have about 50 points of mana. Over 100 is pretty good, over 150 and you could become one of the Seven Sages.\"\nWhen he mentioned the word of ‘Seven Sages,' Monica's heart jumped again.\nOh, how bad for the heart!\n\"Next is ‘ability to comprehend magic formulas'… magic formula is like mathematical equations. As\nchuu\nall said earlier, this is the reason why children who excel in mathematics are suitable for magicians. The magic formula is ‘the blueprint and framework of magic,' that is. The more you comprehend the magic formula correctly, the mooooooore accurate your magic will be. It was what the Silent Witch had said, though.\"\n*Monica shriek internally*\n\"Oh, incidentally, many of magic formulas that \"Silent Witch\" created, often appear on written tests, so keep that in mind.\"\nPlease don't keep that in your mind!!\n\"Well, it's no exaggeration to say that she's an amazing magician that turned the theory of modern magic upside down.\"\nThat's an exaggeration. Please stop with that praise!\nMonica's complexion was no longer pale, but ashen. She would like to escape from this place right now if she could. Next to her, Casey whispered, ‘Monica, are you okay?' but Monica could only give a small nod with a strained smile on her face.\n\"Finally, ‘skill to manipulate mana'. This refers to the process of weaving mana based on a magic formula, and it requires a great deal of sense. A girl with excellent sense can effortlessly turn mana into a spell, while a girl with poor sense will always end up losing her mana. In many cases, a child can use spells to some extent, even if their understanding of the magic formula is low if he has excellent ‘skill to manipulate mana'. In crafting, even with a rough blueprint and framework, you can still create some kind of form. Well, you can't expect a good product out of it.\"\nPerhaps Glenn was that type of person. Even if this type of person does not have a good comprehension of magic formulas, they can formulate a spell to a certain extent with their natural sense.\n\"Well, it's preferable to have all three of these talents. The basic premise is that you can't use magic if you don't have mana. All the students who want to take this class have to have their mana measured.\"\nMacgregan then placed an armful ornament on the podium. It was a metal base with a clear crystal ball on it. The pedestal has a number scale from 0 to 250 on it.\n\"This is called a mana measuring tool, and if you put your hand on this crystal ball, it can easily measure your mana. Here, just like this.\"\nWhen Macgregan placed his hand on the crystal ball, the crystal ball glowed a pale blue, and the number on the scale moved to 158.\nHis mana numbered 158… he's unquestionably at an advanced magician level.\n\"My mana is 158, with blue light, so my best attribute is water… You can easily find out what your mana is like. Pretty impressive, isn't it? Okay, you two, take turns touching it.\"\n………….do I have to?\nMonica's heart beat fast with an unpleasant sound.\nThe general guideline for the quantity of mana is as follows: 1~49 is for ordinary people with no talent, 50~99 is for apprentices and low-level magicians, 100~149 is for intermediate magicians, and 150 and above is for advanced magicians. Over 200 is rarely seen.\nAnd since Seven Sages are required to have mana of 150 or more, they must be measured once a year. Therefore, Monica knew exactly how much mana she had.\nM-My last measurement was… 202.\nSince the amount of mana grows at its peak in the latter half of the teenage years, there is a possibility that it may have increased even more if things went badly.\nAnd having mana over 200 was not a common number by all accounts.\nW-W-W-W-W-What should I do!?\nMonica shuddered as her whole body was drenched in cold sweats.",

      "content": "There is an all-purpose excuse that is always used when one wants to escape from certain situations.\n———Which is, ‘I need to go to the bathroom.'\nHowever, not everyone is comfortable with this all-purpose excuse. For those who are extremely shy, even speaking out in public is a hurdle.\nSo Monica remained rigid in her seat, trying to say this all-purpose excuse, only end with her mouth shut, and then open it again, and then close it all over again.\nI'll say it this time, I'll say it next time, I'll say it when there's good timing in the conversation, I wonder when good timing is, I'll say it anyway, I'll say it, I'll say it this time, this time…\nIn the meantime, the mana measuring tool slowly came closer and closer to Monica. Currently, it was Casey's and Neil's turn to put their hands on the crystal.\nIf she touches that thing, it will be the end for Monica. And they'll know she's not an ordinary person.\n\"Hmm, my strongest attribute is fire, and my magic power is 52… not so great.\"\n\"It is said that the more magic you use in your youth, the more your mana will grow, and it may grow in the future.\"\nAfter Casey, it was Neil's turn to touch the crystal. Neil's results showed that his strongest attribute was earth, and his mana was 96, which was not a bad number.\nFelix admiringly remarked Neil.\n\"Young Maywood, you've never used magic before, have you?\"\n\"Yes, I've only learned a little bit in my class. I heard that my father can use it quite well.\"\n\"Well, the Maywood family has been good at earth magic for many generations.\"\nNow! Now is the time to say, \" I need to go to the bathroom…\" But, with this timing, won't they think I'm interrupting His Highness' speech?\n\"It's my turn now!\" said Glenn cheerfully and took off his gloves.\nWaaaah, once Glenn's done with his turn, I'll be next… I have to get out of here before that happens…\nAs she was holding her head and sweating heavily, she heard a snapping sound right next to her.\nWhy a creaking sound?\nThe sound came from the mana measuring tool in Glenn's hand. A portion of the crystal ball where Glenn's hand was touching was glowing red, revealing a small crack in it.\n\"Oh no,\" Glen exclaimed, and the next moment, a large crack appeared in the crystal ball. Glenn hurriedly took his hand away from the measuring tool.\n\"Professor! This thing's broken!\"\n\"No way. How much do\nchuu\nthink that thing costs?\"\n\"No, no, it's not my fault! It must be defective! It's defective!\"\nThe glowing red in the crystal indicated that Glenn's strongest attribute was fire. The problem was the amount of his mana. The scale indicating his mana was completely overflowing to the very end.\nThe maximum value of that instrument was 250, which meant that Glenn's mana exceeded 250… but how's that possible?\nWithin the kingdom, there were only a handful of people whose mana exceeds 250. Even among the Seven Sages, only two people have that much mana.\nIf Glenn's mana is more than 250, that would be great, but…\nEveryone in the room seemed to think it was a malfunction of the measuring tool. It was the same for Monica.\nGlenn gingerly lifted the cracked measuring instrument and said, ‘This won't explode, will it? It's going to be okay, right?' and was fussing over it.\nThe other students were also watching Glenn, as they were buzzing around—now was her chance to get out.\n\"Um, I… I need to go to the restroom.\"\n\"Oh, sure.\"\nCasey nodded easily, without questioning Monica. Relieved by this, Monica sneaked out of the classroom.\nT-That was close…\nHaaaaaa… puffing out a long breath, Monica leaned against the wall.\nHer heart was beating fast.\nHowever, she could not rest assured here. There was still plenty of time left for the observation of the elective courses. If she didn't go back to the practical magic course, Casey and Felix might get suspicious.\nAs she trudged down the hallway, Monica pondered over what excuse she should give.\nPerhaps she should just pretend that she had been in the bathroom for the whole time because she had a stomachache… As she was thinking of some crude excuse, she caught sight of the classroom of another elective course ahead of her. Since the classroom door was filled with glass, she could see what was going on in there.\nIs that… chess…?\nInside the classroom, the students were quietly playing chess. Monica had never played chess before and didn't know the rules, but she knew that such tabletop games were popular among the nobles.\nSo chess is also one of the subjects at this academy…\nPulling the handout out of her pocket, she saw that chess was indeed one of the courses on the elective list. Judging from the number of students in the classroom, the course seemed to be reasonably popular.\nI wonder if there's a certain rule behind the movement of those pieces.\nSomehow, as she was peering through the glass at the table closest to her, the door in front of her rattled open.\nSurprised, Monica jerked and took a step back.\nThe person who opened the door was a boy with droopy eyes—the secretary of student council Elliot Howard.\nIn the past, he had mocked Monica's dance practice, taken her badge, and thrown it on the roof.\nAs Monica reflexively clutched the badge on her lapel, Elliot smiled, raising his lips to a grin.\n\"Oh, isn't that His Highness' favorite little squirrel? Are you interested in chess? Come on, I'll teach you.\"\n\"N-No, I just…\"\nBefore Monica could turn on her heel, Elliot's hand grabbed Monica's wrist and dragged her into the classroom.\nA few of the students who were playing chess in the classroom stopped and paid attention to Monica. Monica felt very awkward about it and quickly lowered her head.\n\"Well, you can sit here. How long have you been playing chess? …oh, you don't know the piece names, by any chance?\"\n\"N-No, I don't know…\"\nWhen she gave a foolishly honest answer to Elliot's joking words, he chuckled. It wasn't just Elliot. The whole classroom was laughing at Monica.\nAs Elliot laughed and shaking his shoulders, he took a seat in front of Monica.\n\"Then I'll teach you what these pieces are and how you move them. This is the pawn. The weakest piece.\"\nElliot held up the black and white pieces and explained what they were and how to move them.\nMonica's knowledge of board games and cards was limited. It's not that she wasn't interested, it's just that she had never had the chance to play them before. When she was still a student at Minerva, she could only see the children of the nobles playing chess from afar.\nWhen Elliot finished explaining the pieces, Monica timidly raised one hand and asked.\n\"Um, I have a question… what do I have to do to win?\"\n\"Haha! You really don't know where to start from, do you? The winner is simple. The one who takes the enemy's king wins. That's it.\"\nElliot picked up the white king with his fingertips, squinted his eyes, and smiled mockingly.\n\"Chess is a form of mock warfare… an important pastime for the nobles to develop a sense of strategy.\"\n\"…mock warfare\"\nMonica looked down at the pieces lined up on the board.\nPawn, knight, rook, bishop, queen, king… mock warfare using those six types of pieces.\n\"…in which positions does the magic soldier hold?\"\n\"Maybe something along the lines of a bishop. Since in the past, the monks preferred to use spells.\"\n\"Then, are the magicians'—monk soldiers' spell capability fixed? What are their main strengths and ranges, and how fast can they set up defensive barriers? And what are the individual combat capabilities of the soldiers and the food reserves of the fort?\"\n\"Hah?\"\nAs Elliot's eyes widened, Monica questioned more quickly.\n\"Does this mock warfare have a defined season, climate, and temperature? What is the height of the terrain? How about the wind direction?\"\nElliot was puzzled by Monica's serious question, but then he started laughing out loud.\n\"Oh, come on, how can there be that many elements on this board! This is just a game, little squirrel. You talk like you've been to war before!\"\n\"I have… never been in a war.\"\nRight, Monica has never participated in a war between humans—but she has participated in dragon slaying.\nAt that time, Monica had been thoroughly drilled by Louis Miller on how to read strategic charts.\nThe wyvern that Monica defeated had to be killed in the air—that's why she had to know the terrain, the direction of the wind, and the strength of the wind in order to release her magic accurately.\nBut this board had none of that.\n\"It's just a flat surface, okay? Height is irrelevant. The pieces only move in predetermined ways. No negotiations between superiors, just defeating the king.\"\n\"O-Oh…\"\nMonica asked to make sure, and Elliot nodded with a look as if he were looking at something strange.\nStill staring at the board, Monica opened her mouth.\n\"Then, that would be quite simple, I think.\"",

      "content": "\"Then, that would be quite simple, I think.\"\nMonica's statement brought chills to the atmosphere in the classroom.\n——How fearless… and shameless, this little girl.\nElliot lifted the edge of his mouth, his droopy eyes narrowing fiercely as he glared at Monica.\n\"Do you understand what you are saying, Miss Norton? You've just made enemies of everyone in this classroom.\"\nMonica didn't answer him. She just stared at the board in silence.\n\"You're not going to move that pawn forward one square and say, ‘See, I could have easily moved this pawn!', aren't you?\"\nMonica still didn't say anything. But the blank expression on her face as she stared at the board reminded him of something he had seen before. It was the same expression as when she was reviewing the accounting records she assigned to before. At that time, she gave no reaction when Bridget slapped her on the cheek, instead, she kept staring at the numbers with her eyes.\nElliot felt a strange, unfathomable eeriness in the same blank expression as that time. What came to mind was something Felix had said to him before. When he asked Felix why he had chosen Monica Norton to be student council accountant, Felix replied,\n——Because I don't know where Miss Norton's ‘standing' is.\nThen I'll measure her ‘standing'… in this place.\nElliot then rearranged the pieces on the chessboard that Monica was staring at so that the white pieces were lined up exactly in her direction. Monica, who had been staring at the board, slowly raised her head and looked at him. He returned Monica's gaze with a fearless grin.\n\"Why don't we play one game? I'll play without the queen.\"\n\"…who will move first?\"\n\"The play starts from the white piece. How about you go first?\"\nMonica looked at him with wide eyes as he removed the black queen from the board.\n\"Then, I'll go first, is that okay?\"\n\"Yeah, sure.\"\nWhile nodding leisurely, Elliot felt a strange irritation in his chest. Even as a beginner, Monica Norton has noticed that in this game, the first one to move has the advantage.\n\"…okay, I'll make my move.\"\nWith that, Monica didn't hesitate to advance the pawn in the center by two squares. The way to proceed with a pawn seems simple, but it is more complicated than it seems.\nBasically, it can only move forward one step at a time, but it also can move two squares from its starting point if there are no other pieces in front of it. In addition, the movement becomes unusual only when taking an enemy piece, sometimes moving diagonally, and if it advances to the far end, it can be ‘promoted' to another piece.\n…I doubt she can understand it after just one explanation.\nMoving the center pawn ahead was a common move. If the front pieces were not moved quickly enough to open the way, the back pieces will not be able to get through.\n…an amateur approach, I guess.\nLooking down at the board with cold eyes, Elliot also moved his pieces.\nThe pleasant clicking of the pieces was a sign of someone who was used to playing chess. In comparison, Monica's manner of playing was that of an amateur. Even the way she held and placed the pieces seemed awkward.\n——And yet, there was no hesitation in the way she moved her pieces.\nWhen Elliot played his piece, Monica followed quickly with her next piece.\nThis game was just for fun. It wasn't timed, and there was no time limit, to begin with. Then, she should have taken her time and think about it as much as she wanted, but when Elliot moved his pieces, Monica moved hers without pause. It was so fast that he wondered if she was moving it blindly.\n…is that how you're going to put pressure on me? …wait.\nLooking down at the board, Elliot furrowed his brow. Monica's strategy was like a theory written in a textbook. If this had been any other person, he would not have been so surprised. But Monica was someone who had just learned the rules for the first time.\n…even so, will using theory alone could make her hold the game this long?\nElliot pondered for a moment and then moved his piece. Again, Monica quickly moved her piece. It made him couldn't help but open his mouth.\n\"There' s no time limit on this game, you know. Why don't you take your time and think about your move?\"\n\"……….\"\nWithout replying, Monica just stared at the pieces on the board. Elliot frowned slightly and directed his next move. Immediately, Monica made her next move.\n* * *\nAt some point, people began to gather around their tables.\nBut the current Elliot didn't pay attention to the gallery around him. His gaze was fixed on the board, and his mouth, which was now covered with one hand, was tensed under his hand.\n…how could it become like this?\nHe was one of the three most skilled players in this classroom. Despite the disadvantage of having no queen, he did not slack off. He was going to beat Monica thoroughly with a handicap, and then checkmate her thoroughly after he got rid of every single piece of the white camp.\nAnd yet, he was the one who was now being cornered. That much was apparent to everyone.\nMonica Norton did not play any strange or bad moves as beginners often do. Her moves were as clean as a textbook—very precise and without any waste. She read all of his moves and then crushed them one by one before collapsing his camp. If this continues, it will only be a matter of time before it falls apart.\n…no, wait.\nStaring at the board, he realized that there was one thing that could turn the tables. In his camp, his king and rook have not moved yet. And there are no other pieces in between.\nI can use castling.\nOnly under certain conditions can a king and a rook be moved simultaneously in a single move. That's what castling is. However, he had not yet taught her how to use castling. He thought he could easily beat her without using castling.\n…If I use castling, I can win.\nBut she didn't know about castling.\nStill, do I have to use it against her?\nHis pride wavered. Should he continue to be defeated? Or win by using the castling that he hadn't taught Monica? The moment his hand stops, the people around him start to stir. They were probably wondering why he hadn't used castling move.\n——That's right. These guys didn't know I haven't taught Monica Norton how to do castling.\nWhen he realized this, his hand moved unconsciously to move the king and rook simultaneously… to do castling move.\nMonica, who had been staring only on the board, blinked and looked at him.\nStop. Don't look at me.\nTrying to escape from Monica's gaze, he turned his gaze away. And yet, his mouth fluently spouted out his excuses.\n\"What I just did was a castling, which can be used when you have a king and a rook you haven't moved yet, no other pieces between them, and the king isn't being checkmated…\"\n\"I lost.\"\nBefore he could finish his explanation, Monica declared defeat.\n\"If that ‘castling'? is valid under the official rules, then I don't think I will able to win.\"\nHe was astonished.\nWhy is Monica Norton not angry? She had been beaten by a rule she had not been taught. She has the right to be angry that this is not fair. She has the right to do that.\nAnd yet, Monica gave him a faint smile without a hint of anger.\n\"I'm sorry for saying it was easy… but chess was harder than I thought… no matter how hard I tried to make the best move, my opponent was human… so there were a lot of uncertainties.\"\nHe was the winner of this game. But what he felt in his heart was a bitter sense of defeat… and self-loathing.\nIf only Monica have blamed him for being unfair in using a move she had not been taught, that would make him feel better. But, seeing none of this as a significant issue, she rearranged the pieces and pondered about castling.\nHe was about to say something to her. Whether it was an apology or a questioning voice asking why she didn't blame him, he couldn't tell for himself. Still, he felt he had to say something.\nBut before he can voice it, Boyd, a teacher of this classroom, interjected.\n\"A female student over there. What's your name?\"\nMonica's gaze wanders left and right, but this classroom has only a few female students in it. And she was the only female student in Boyd's line of sight.\n\"Mo, Mo, Mo… Moni, Moni, Moni…\"\nShe was wincing as she tried her best to move her mouth, but she could not say her name very well, only repeating the same sound of Moni Moni.\nBoyd was a bald tough-looking man. His muscular and robust body made him more suited to be wielding a sword or spear than a chess teacher. It was no wonder Monica was frightened.\nElliot let out a slip voice of ‘good grief' then interjected.\n\"This is Miss Monica Norton. Like me, she is a student council member, Professor Boyd.\"\n\"I'll remember.\"\nBoyd said briefly in a low voice as if came from the bottom of his stomach then handed Monica a sheet of paper… it was an application form for a chess course.\nStill making strange Moni-Moni voices, Monica alternately looked at Boyd and the application form with teary eyes.\nIn response, Boyd told Monica in a low voice.\n\"Be sure to take the course.\"\nMonica still whined Moni-Moni as she could only agree to him before motioning her head up and down stiffly.\nThat probably is a face that doesn't understand what she's getting into.\nElliot closed his eyes as he let out a sigh exasperatedly.",

      "content": "After school, for the first time in a week, Monica showed up at the student council room, and Felix was watching her as he lowered his brows.\n\"Miss Norton, I haven't seen you around halfway through the course observation… where have you been, I wonder?\"\nMonica winced and decided to make the same excuse she had made to Casey.\n\"U-Um, you see, I went to the restroom, and on the way, I… was invited into the chess class.\"\nTo be precise, she was not invited but was dragged in forcibly by Elliot.\nAfter that one match with Elliot, the course observation period was over, so Monica couldn't visit the other courses.\nFelix seems to get a bit surprised when he heard her mentioned the chess class, so he turned his gaze to Elliot Howard, who was doing some assignment in the back.\n\"Speaking of chess, I remember Secretary Howard was picking up such a course.\"\nElliot was quietly going through the paperwork, probably pretending not to hear.\nElliot and Bridget, who clearly weren't pleased to have Monica as a student council member, treated her as if she were air or something non-existent when she was in the student council room.\nBut today, Elliot was a little strange. The way he ignored her was very obvious as if he had disgruntled towards someone.\nD-Did I do, something wrong or say something rude, again?\nAs Monica was breaking out in a cold sweat, Cyril Ashley came back from the archives room and stared at Monica.\n\"You're not forcing yourself, are you?\"\n\"I-I'm not. And I'm sorry for the inconvenience… of taking a w-week off.\"\nThe last time she saw Cyril was in the infirmary after Monica had been poisoned and collapsed.\nIt has been a while since the time he had shouted at her on how he was going to tie her up with a rope if she ever tried to escape from her bed.\nAfter done staring at Monica's face intently, Cyril then crossed his arms and snorting haughtily.\n\"I've got to take over your work for the past week you've been absent. So, be prepared, because I'm going to give you a thorough work today.\"\n\"Y-Yes!\"\nMonica nodded tensely with tears in her eyes and took the bundle of documents that Cyril handed to her.\nShe then moved to her work desk to check the week's worth of documents, but there was nothing particularly unusual to note—in fact, all the work had been neatly organized. All Monica had to do was to read the contents.\nThe meticulous, detailed handwriting probably belonged to Cyril. He had taken over Monica's work for a week.\nDetermined not to cause him any more trouble, Monica refocused her concentration on the documents.\nAs expected, the thickest document was things related to the school festival which held on next month. As she was looking over the draft budget, a voice came from behind Monica.\n\"Hey.\"\nNot realizing that it was directed at her, Monica kept her eyes fixed on the draft budget.\nCyril, who was working on something else besides her, looked at her in exasperation.\n\"Monica Norton. You're called out.\"\n\"W-Wha?\"\nAfter letting out some silly words, she turned around and saw Elliot standing behind her.\nElliot seemed to have a bitter look on his face when he turned his gaze down at Monica.\n\"Miss Norton, do you have some time after this today?\"\n\"Eh? Um…\"\nWhen she heard about the after-school call, ‘would it be what they called love confession?' but Monica didn't have the nerve to get excited about it.\nThis might what you call when someone calling a person out in a place where absolutely no one around, only to abuse that person and beat her/him up later. Perhaps, he's planning to take her badge again.\nAs Monica unconsciously clutched the badge on her lapel as she cast her head down, Cyril interrupted him.\n\"Make it another day. She has a week's worth of work to catch up on today.\"\n\"Well, okay. I'm sorry for interrupting your work.\"\nStrangely, Elliot looked relieved and went back to his seat.\nAs Monica watched his back, Cyril whispered to her.\n\"Did something happen between you and Secretary Howard?\"\n\"I-I'm not sure… but during chess class, I might have said something rude.\"\nShe just played one game of chess during the course observation. However, Monica might not have noticed, but there was a great possibility that she had made Elliot displeased.\n…but playing chess seems fun. I'd like to take that course.\nUnlike mathematical equations, the opponent in chess is a human being. Therefore, a strategic aspect of the game cannot be won by just calculating probabilities. And that kind of aspect was what made Monica's got interested in it.\n\"Are you not going to take the magic courses?\"\nAt Cyril's sudden words, Monica's hand that was holding the pen trembled.\nWhy do Felix, Cyril, and everyone else want to encourage Monica to pick up the magic course?\n\"I think it's too difficult for me… what about you Lord Ashley, did you choose the practical magic as your elective course?\"\n\"I currently taking up an Advanced Practical Magic course.\"\nAdvanced Practical Magic was a special elective course that required students to complete a certain number of courses.\n\"Advanced Practical Magic is only available to those who have excelled in Practical Magic in their first or second year. If you wish to pick up that course, you must have completed both Practical Magic and Elementary Magic within your first or second year.\"\n\"I see…\"\n\"In other words, if a second-year like you want to take Advanced Practical Magic course next year, you have to pick both an Elementary Magic and Practical Magic this year.\"\n\"Oh…\"\nAs Monica vaguely responded to him, Cyril tapped his fingers on the desk and eyed Monica.\n\"So let me ask you again, are you not going to take the magic courses?\"\n\"Um… Well…\"\nMonica was an undercover student at the academy who was hiding her true identity.\nEven if it's just an elective course, whenever there's magic involved, she's got a feeling she's going to slip up. Especially when magic formulas are involved, she might inadvertently get carried away.\n\"I will not pick up the magic courses…\"\n\"I see…\"\nAfter a short murmur, Cyril returned to his work, and Monica decided to concentrate on the documents in front of her.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAfter the day's student council works were settled, Cyril made a suggestion to Felix.\n\"Treasurer Norton and I will be staying behind to finish things up. I will lock the door.\"\n\"Okay. I'll leave it to you, but… make sure not to stay up too late.\"\n\"I will.\"\nOnce Cyril nodded, the rest of the student council members began to leave the student council room.\nAll that remained in the room were Cyril and Monica.\nMonica looked at the documents on her desk and tilted her head.\nI wonder what kind of task to have us staying behind?\nTo tell the truth, Monica couldn't think of any duties that required her to stay behind.\nThe week's duties have been taken over during normal duty hours, and today's duties have been completed.\n\"Um, Lord Ashley. Do these tasks were related to the school festival?\"\n\"It's not. Clear your desk and wait a moment.\"\n\"O-Okay…\"\nWhy the desk should be cleared when the tasks need to be done?\nDespite her doubts, Monica did as she was told, put the documents back on the shelf, and sat down on a chair to wait for Cyril to return.\nApparently, Cyril had left the student council room. Could it be that he has something to bring from the other room?\nRestlessly fidgeting her fingers on her lap, Cyril came back with something in both hands.\nIn Cyril's hand was a white cup. It was not a kind of elegant cup used for a tea party, but just a plain white cup that was a bit thick and chunky.\nCyril placed one of the cups in front of Monica and sat down across her.\n\"Drink this.\"\nMonica looked at the cup that was placed in front of her. It contained a light brown liquid. The color was lighter than coffee and the scent had faintly sweet. Monica had smelled this scent once before.\n\"Is this… chocolate?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nChocolate is a popular delicacy among the nobility. It is a drink made by grinding cocoa beans and mixing them with sugar and milk. It has a distinctive flavor and is more expensive than coffee.\nMonica had been given a drink of chocolate once before… but that chocolate was supposed to be more sludgy.\nLifting the cup fearfully, the liquid inside shook. It looks lighter and silkier than the one Monica had drunk before.\nCyril sipped his cup with a nonchalant look on his face. Monica imitated him and sipped from the cup.\n\"……..!\"\nMonica rounded her eyes in surprise.\nThe light texture and mild sweetness were unlike any other chocolate she'd had before. It wasn't sludgy, and the sourness characteristic of cocoa was milder.\nPreparing a drink of chocolate took more work than coffee. Coffee beans can be stored to some extent just fine after they've been ground, but cacao beans have a high-fat content, so they can never be stored even after being ground. In other words, to make this kind of drink, grinding it first was a must. Since it involved that much effort, chocolate was not popular as coffee.\nHowever, this chocolate did not have the thick texture characteristic of fat.\n\"This chocolate… has less fat?\"\n\"That's right. The beans are processed by removing the fat from the beans and grinding them into a powder, by using the latest technology.\"\nIf cacao beans could be preserved in powder form, it would be a very revolutionary invention. It will be easier to store than ever before, and easier to drink because it will be dissolved in water or milk.\nAs Monica secretly admired it, Cyril glanced at Monica with one eye.\n\"I heard about your incident from Claudia. You drank the poisoned bitter tea that the daughter of Count Norn prepared for you.\"\n\"…y-yeah…\"\nThe bitter poison was put into a cup of tea, but instead of spitting it out, Monica drank it while still thinking, ‘Is this sort of drink?'. As a result, it ended up becoming a commotion.\nAs Monica shrank from the memory of that incident, Cyril stated in a strong tone.\n\"Because you usually don't eat enough of the good food, it ended up that way. You should have improved your diet. You cannot afford to bother His Highness again, like the other day.\"\n\"I-I will… I'm sorry…\"\n\"In other words, this is for His Highness. You got it!?\"\n\"Y-Yes!\"\nIn response to Monica's shaking of her head, Cyril nodded and tipped his cup, saying, \"As long you understand.'\n\"You've been elected by His Highness for your abilities… Then again, there's no guarantee that someone jealous of your ability won't cause an incident like what the daughter of Count Norn did.\"\nCyril was absolutely right. Originally, Monica was supposed to be the one guarding Felix, but instead, she was being helped by him.\n\"You should at least learn to defend yourself. Don't let His Highness keep handle it for you.\"\n\"…yes.\"\nMonica hung her head in shame and thought absentmindedly.\nHas Cyril ever been jealous of someone else, too?\n…he shouldn't, shouldn't have.\nBeing a part of the second prince's entourage would attract a lot of admiration and envy. There would be no small number of envious people.\nAnd now, Monica was in the same position as him.\n\"Um, Lord Ashley. T-Thank you, very much. For the other day, and, uh, for this chocolate too…\"\nCyril snorted as usual and blurted out, ‘Just taste it and drink it.'\nMonica nodded her head and drank the warm chocolate to relish it.\nCyril, who had been staring at such Monica, suddenly opened his mouth as if he had remembered something.\n\"Let me tell you one thing, don't tell His Highness about today. Especially about this chocolate…\"\n\"Um, Lord Ashley…\"\nCyril glared at Monica with a deep crease between his eyebrows when Monica interrupted him with a freaked-out expression.\n\"What?\"\n\"His Highness…\"\n\"What about His Highness?\"\n\"…is behind you.\"\nCyril's expression vanished from his face.\nBehind Cyril, Felix was standing there with a broad smile on his face. The way he eliminated all signs of his presence was as good as that of an assassin.\n\"How can you have a tea party without me?\"\n\"Y-Y-Your Highness!\"\n\"I never thought I'd hear that stuttering way of speaking from anyone other than Miss Norton.\"\n\"Ah, no, this is… just…\"\nCyril became unusually pale and flustered. His gaze in particular was flickering over the cup in his hand. It's as if he wants to hide the chocolate from Felix.\nIn response to such Cyril, Felix smiled with his usual gentle smile.\n\"You don't have to hide it from me. I wouldn't mind having something like that, you know?\"\n\"U-Um… but…\"\nCyril's panic was like that of a criminal who has been found in possession of illegal drugs. Why was he getting so flustered?\n\"I'd like some of those chocolates. Could you make some for me too?\"\nWhen Felix said this, Cyril gave a ‘yes' answer with a somewhat relieved look on his face and left the room at a brisk pace.\nLooking over his back, Felix let out a sigh.\n\"You don't have to be so uptight.\"\nUnsure of the meaning of the exchange between Felix and Cyril, Monica asked Felix with trepidation.\n\"Oh, um… is this chocolate, actually, something I shouldn't drink?\"\n\"No, not at all. In fact, it's become a trend among the nobility in this kingdom lately.\"\nThen why was Cyril so flustered?\nMonica tilted her head, but Felix said it was nothing.\n\"As for the technique to remove fat from cocoa beans, it was invented by a scholar from the neighboring Kingdom of Randall.\"\nThe Kingdom of Randall was a small kingdom located between the Kingdom of Ridill and the Great Empire to the East.\nHow did Cyril's flustered behavior have anything to do with what the scholar there had invented? Monica had no idea, but Felix then told her.\n\"The mother of my elder brother Lionel is the Princess of Randall.\"\nFinally, Monica understood why Cyril had tried to hide the chocolate from Felix.\nThere were three princes in this country, but each had a different mother.\nThe mother of the First Prince Lionel was the Princess of Rundall. As a result, many members of his faction naturally place importance on the connection with Randall.\nCyril was probably worried that his fondness for the latest technology of Randall's chocolates would make His Highness think he was a person of the first prince faction.\n\"Whenever I show up at a tea party, no one offers me chocolates made with Randall's techniques. I mean, what's the harm in something that tastes good?\"\nAfter saying that, Felix snatched the cup out of Monica's hand and took a sip of the chocolate.\nThe prince himself sipped from a cup that someone else had sipped from, a spectacle that would make Cyril's eyes widen.\nHowever, to Monica, Felix's current actions seemed to be an indication of his openness.\n\"…being royalty must be tough.\"\n\"Yeah, really.\"\nFelix's profile, as he muttered, lacked his usual calmness… there was a coldness in his face as if he was looking down on the ridiculousness.",

      "content": "Lately, it had become a regular occurrence for her to have lunch with Lana, Casey, and Claudia whenever lunchtime came around.\nToday, as the four of them were having meals together, they could hear people around them talking about the school festival.\nThe school festival was only one month away. And all the students were busy preparing for it.\n\"The costumes for this year's show will be really amazing! After all, I supervised them myself!\"\nLana proudly said as she tore off a piece of bread, and Casey smiled as she put a fish fry in her bread.\n\"Well, that was pretty intense. I mean, the battle between the students of the History Research Club and Lana…\"\nIt seems that Lana, who was chosen to be a costume designer for the play that was the centerpiece of the school festival, had a heated discussion with the president of the History Research Club about costumes.\nThe debate between the president of the History Research Club, who insisted that the costumes should be based on folklore, and Lana, who insisted that the costumes should be trendy and glamorous, lasted for several days, and in the end, the two shook hands like war buddies.\n\"U-Um, what kind of play are you performing?\"\nIn response to Monica's questioning voice, Casey said while taking a bite of bread.\n\"Ah, of course. This is your first time participating in this year's event. Every year, the play is decided to be a story about the Spirit Kings and the Founder King.\"\nIt's a story that everyone in this country has heard since childhood.\nAbout a thousand years ago, the Founder King of the Kingdom of Ridill made a pact with the seven Spirit Kings of fire, water, earth, thunder, wind, light, and darkness to bring peace to a land ravaged by the dragon, by using their power to exterminate the Evil Dragon. And so, in this land of peace, he founded a kingdom… or so was the founding legend told.\nAccording to the school, this play was the main highlight of the Serendia Academy Festival.\nThere will also be choral and music recitals, charity bazaars, tea parties, and finally a dance party at the end of the day.\nAnd Monica, the treasurer, stared blankly at the draft budget because of the large amount of money involved.\nMonica had thought that the students would have made their own stage sets and costumes for their play, but this was the Serendia Academy. Basically, once the students have decided on the design, the rest of the work was mostly outsourced. And the stage sets and costumes made by the professionals were said to be quite magnificent.\n\"I-I was so surprised when I read the report… they even set off fireworks…\"\nAt Monica's words, Claudia, who had been quietly sipping her soup until now, blurted out.\n\"…that's right, there would be many sounds booming from morning until night… I find it more annoyance than anything.\"\n\"It would better be doing fireworks more flashy!\"\nIn response to Claudia's comment, Lana clenched her fist and made a strong argument. From her response, it looks like Lana might have a hand in the stage production as well.\nWhen Lana started to talk about the performance, Casey, who was listening to her, let out a big yawn. In response to an unladylike yawn, Lana's lips pursed.\n\"What? Is my story so boring that it makes you sleepy?\"\n\"Sorry, I'm a little sleep-deprived. I was up late making embroidery for the charity bazaar.\"\n\"Y-You all seems, to be so busy.\"\nWhen Monica commented, and Lana, Casey, and Claudia all looked at Monica at once. The three of them have a rare look of unanimity on their faces—a look of surprise.\nLana then spoke up on behalf of the three of them.\n\"Despite what you might think, the busiest person right now is probably you, Monica.\"\n\"…eh? I-Is that so?\"\nIt was true that the workload had increased dramatically in the past few days, but in Monica's opinion, the amount of work she had been doing in the first place was not that great.\nWith the school festival approaching, the amount of work-related to accounting had increased, but it wasn't that hard for Monica. Ever since she was holed up in the mountain cabin, she had to deal with more complicated and cumbersome materials. Compared to that, it's not much work.\n…If anything, it was probably more difficult when I was at Minerva.\nAt the Institution Training Magicians of Minerva, the main focus of the school festival was to present the results of each student's research. As a scholarship student, Monica was naturally required to make a presentation on her research, and she worked hard to prepare papers and materials.\nAt that time, she had prepared everything for the exhibition and stayed in her laboratory on the day of the festival, so she didn't really understand what kind of atmosphere the festival had.\nBut now, even more so than when she was at Minerva, she could feel the exuberance of her surroundings spreading to her.\nMonica hates crowded places. The worst place for that is a festival…\n…Now I think I might actually feel a little excited.\nAlthough there was no clear image of what she wanted to do with the school festival, she hoped it would be successful.\nSafely and without incident.\n\"Monica Norton.\"\nSuddenly, a voice called out to her, and she looked up to see the vice president, Cyril, approaching her.\nAs Monica straightened her back unconsciously, Cyril held out a sheet of paper.\n\"After school today, we have work to supervise the incoming materials. We the student council members need to be present there, so come to the east gate after school. This is the list of materials. Try to get it into your head.\"\n\"The east gate?\"\nIt was a gate that was usually closed and rarely used.\nWhen Monica voiced her question, Cyril gave a small nod.\n\"We have so many materials to bring in, if all the suppliers use the main gate, they'll get in the way of the students.\"\nAccording to Cyril, there will be three suppliers coming for today alone. There were fabrics for costumes, fireworks, and wood.\nOf all the materials, wood has the biggest volume, so it had to be brought in through the east gate.\n\"The fireworks will be supervised by His Highness and Secretary Howard. Secretary Graham and General Manager Maywood will be in charge of clothing-related matters. While we're in charge of the wood.\"\n\"I-I understand.\"\nMonica nodded, and Claudia, sitting next to her, sipped her tea and blurted out.\n\"…how careless of you to divulge the plans of the student council members to a third party.\"\nCyril's eyebrows twitched up at Claudia's words, and he glared at his sister.\n\"I have no problem with other students knowing our schedule.\"\n\"…so Neil will be alone with Bridget Graham for the verification process… alone with a woman other than me… I guess I have to intervene.\"\n\"Cut it out!!\"\nClaudia Ashley was a person who would seriously carry out what seemed like a bad joke.\nEspecially when his fiancée, Neil, was involved.\n\"The verification process is also witnessed by the supplier. They will never be alone. And don't you dare interfere with our work! …and Monica Norton. The amount of wood we are in charge of is quite a lot. Be there as soon as class is over.\"\n\"Yes, Lord Ashley.\"\nAs Monica nodded her head, a slender arm wrapped easily around Monica's round head—it was Claudia.\n\"Oh dear, what a problem. My name is Ashley, too.\"\n\"Uh, well, Lady Claudia is Lady Claudia, and… well, uh…\"\n\"…oh dear, she won't call you by your name, will she, my dear brother? Since I am friends with Monica, she calls me by my first name, but she doesn't call you by your first name because you are just an acquaintance. I guess it can't be helped, since you just an acquaintance. Oh, how sad you are, for not be adored by your juniors, my-dear-bro-ther.\"\nAs Claudia smiled thinly looking up at Cyril, Cyril's cheeks twitched tensely.\nShe's been thinking for a while, but it seemed that these two siblings didn't get along very well. Both Lana and Casey looked troubled as they watched the interaction between the two siblings.\nMonica was nervous. If she didn't do anything, Cyril would become a pitiful senior who wasn't adored by his junior.\n\"Um, Lord Ashley…I mean, the older brother, Lord Ashley, is very good at his job, he's a great person, and… I-I respect him.\"\nAt Monica's best follow-up, Cyril glared at Monica, moving his gleaming blue eyes. Scary.\n\"I-I'm s-s-s-s-sorry. That's right, I should have… just called you vice president, right? I'm sorry, vice president.\"\nCyril was glaring at Claudia with a bitter look on his face, but to Monica, it looked like he was the one being glared at.\nCyril exhaled deeply when he saw that Monica was shaking with tears in her eyes.\n\"…Cyril is fine.\"\n\"Y-Y-Yes, Lord Cyril.\"\nWhen Monica said this in a quivering voice, Claudia giggled close to Monica's ear.\n\"…oh, my. My dear brother, who is just an acquaintance, is making a big deal about being called by his name.\"\n\"I've never thought of you to have a friend. Claudia.\"\n\"…of course I have. We're very good friends. Right, Mo-ni-ka?\"\nWhen Monica cocked her head up and down, Cyril's brow wrinkled.\n\"Monica Norton. You're not being forced by Claudia, are you?\"\n\"N-N-N-N-Nooooo, t-t-t-t-that's not true…\"\nMonica now shook her head, and Claudia pressed her body even closer to Monica's.\nClaudia gave off a very nice smell. And yet, it didn't make her feel any better.\n\"…How terrible. I can't believe you're jealous of our friendship… You're jealous of me and Monica because we're so close.\"\n\"Who would be jealous of the likes of you?!\"\n\"Why don't you take a look? Maybe you should check it out for yourself because you look terrible with jealousy on your face.\"\nBlue veins were popping up on Cyril's face. He was a step away before the rage burst.\nMonica hurriedly spoke up.\n\"D-Don't worry! L-L-L-Lord Cyril looks the same as always!\"\nAfter all, Cyril always had that angry look on his face when he interacted with Monica.\nNothing to lie about, it's the same as always.\n\"…oh, my dear brother, you get jealous all the time regardless of who it is?\"\n\"N-Nooooooo, I-I didn't mean it like that…\"\n\"Monica Norton! If Claudia is causing you trouble, tell her so!\"\n\"No, um…\"\n\"You don't think I'm bothering you, do you, Mo-ni-ca?\"\n\"I-I'd never…\"\nAn older brother with a platinum blonde and a beautiful face, and a younger sister with black hair who was one of the three most beautiful girls in the school.\nEven getting caught between the exchange of the beautiful siblings, Monica still looked as if she was about to die.\nCasey, who was drinking tea after done eating her lunch, muttered in exasperation.\n\"…I guess Miss Claudia is playing with them.\"\nBoth Cyril and Monica were being played in Claudia's hands.\nWhat a terrible personality, thought Lana as she's rubbing her forehead and let out a sigh.",

      "content": "As Monica's familiar, Nero mainly spent his daytime strolling around the school grounds.\nOf course, as an excellent familiar, he did not just sit idly and bask in the sun lazily. While studying humans by secretly listening to the class outside the window, he was also keeping an eye out for anyone suspicious in the vicinity of the second prince.\nParticularly since Monica had told him that outsiders would be coming and going today, he was even putting more effort into keeping Felix's surroundings than usual.\n…well, since that prince has a contracted spirit, I doubt anything will happen to him.\nWith his good sensing at mana, Nero had noticed that the white lizard was always in Felix's pocket. It was probably a high-ranking water spirit.\nSpeaking of contracted spirit, according to the magic class he's been secretly listening to lately, making a contract with a spirit can only be done by an advanced magician or above…\nThen, does that prince a magician?\nIt's best to ask Monica directly about this kind of thing. After all, she was a magician who stood at the peak of the kingdom, one of the Seven Sages. It may not seem like it, but when it comes to magic knowledge, not many people can match Monica.\nAs he was thinking that he should ask Monica to teach him about the contract with the spirits, something caught Nero's senses.\nNero's whiskers twitched, then he focused on his attention.\nIt was a weak mana reaction. Since this school taught practical magic, it was not surprising to detect a mana reaction.\nBut its location was incongruous.\nis that a warehouse? They're moving something in.\nIn the large warehouse on the west side of the school, a number of employees of the supplier were coming and going, bringing in wooden crates. With his good nose, Nero immediately noticed that the contents inside were some kind of gunpowder.\nMonica said the stuff they're bringing in were materials for the festival… Do humans use gunpowder for festivals? Are they going to do some construction work?\nThe sight of the crates being carried in was a bit of a mystery to Nero, who has never seen fireworks before.\nThe person supervising the people loading the crates was the second prince, the target of the escort. Next to him stood a droopy eyes person with a bad personality.\nThe prince and Droopy Eyes were unaware that there's a mana reaction in the warehouse… or so seems like that.\nNero had noticed it immediately because of his keen sense of mana, but apparently, humans weren't like that.\nIt made him recalled what Monica had mentioned before. In order for humans to detect mana, they need to use a specialized spell for sensing, or something like that.\n…I have a bad feeling about this.\nNero jumped down from the tree and ran to the east gate where Monica was.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nWhen Monica headed for her designated place at the east gate after the class finished, the suppliers were already bringing in the materials. And Cyril was giving instructions to the suppliers near the east warehouse.\nAs Monica rushed over to him, struggling to overcome her slow pace, Cyril raised his eyebrows and yelled, ‘So slow!!'.\n\"Lord, Cyril… I-I apologize… for being laaa-cough cough!\"\nDue to her lack of physical strength, having only run this far made Monica unable to catch her breath.\nAware of Monica's lack of physicality, Cyril stared down at Monica, who was breathing heavily, rubbed his forehead with his finger.\n\"Hurry up and adjust your unbecoming breathing. The materials have only just been brought in. It probably won't be finished soon.\"\n\"Y-Yesh…\"\n\"Also, the person in charge of stage design should be here today to check on the materials…\"\nCyril then looked around and saw a figure coming towards him from the school building.\n\"Looks like she's here.\"\nTurning her eyes to where Cyril was looking, Monica blinked her eyes.\nThe one who was coming towards them was a lively-looking girl with light brown hair tied up into a single knot—It was Casey.\n\"Sorry to keep you waiting! Our design director got into an argument with the historical research club… Since it won't be over for a while, I came here on behalf of her. I'm Casey Groove from the second year.\"\n\"Since it will only be counting the quantity, even you're the represent, it won't be a problem.\"\n\"Yes, I look forward to working with you! You too, Monica!\"\nWhen Casey called out to her, Monica nodded her head.\nIn truth, Monica was relieved to see Casey here since she couldn't talk properly to someone she had never met before.\nAs a shy person, Monica has no trouble in work that related to numbers, no matter how much work there is, but when it comes to reporting, giving instructions, and other tasks that require interpersonal skills, it only makes the difficulty level rises quickly.\nAs Monica patting her chest relieved at Casey's arrival, Cyril gave her instructions.\n\"I will inform the suppliers where to store the materials. Treasurer Norton, you will check the list to see if there are any omissions.\"\n\"U-Understood.\"\nAs Monica nodded, Casey patted her on the shoulder.\n\"I'll help Monica. Maybe we can check the materials together while at it.\"\n\"T-Thank you.\"\nCasey smiled pleasantly, \"You're welcome,\" and picked up the list.\nWhen Casey saw the names and quantities of the materials lined up, she retracted her pleasant smile. Her cheeks were slightly tensed.\n\"…wow… these numbers… are… so jam-packed…\"\nMonica was strangely excited to see all the numbers lined up in a condensed, but apparently, most people are not. Casey was no exception, and with a weary look on her face, she held out the list to Monica.\n\"I will do the actual counting. So can I ask you to verify it on the list?\"\n\"Okay!\"\nMatching the data was Monica's forte.\nCasey handed Monica the list with a wry smile and ran over to the materials already brought in.\nMost of the woods brought in were already processed. Some were thin boards, some were sticks, and some were already assembled into some form. All of them were probably things that will be used on stage.\nCasey will be counting the type and number of woods, and Monica will verify it against the list.\nAfter repeating the process for a while, Monica suddenly looked up. There was no trace of Casey in her line of sight.\n\"…Huh? Casey?\"\nMonica turned her head from the list and looked for Casey. Then, from the other side of the wood ahead, ‘Over here!' she heard Casey's voice. Apparently, the woods had obscured Casey's figure from her sight.\nThe back of the warehouse had been mostly checked, so it might be better if she moved herself a little closer to the entrance.\nWhile Monica was walking towards Casey with the list in her hand… she heard something snapped.\n…what is that?\nThe very next moment, the woods, which had been tied with ropes and placed vertically, tilted diagonally.\nThe rope that held the wood in place was broken off in the middle.\n\"Monica, over here!\"\nCasey was standing just in the direction of the falling wood. And she was unaware that the wood was falling towards her.\n\"Watch out!\"\nCyril, who had been giving instructions outside the warehouse, shouted briefly and began chanting a spell in rapid succession. Perhaps he was trying to help Casey by casting a spell. But the wood was already looming over Casey's head. Using chanting won't work in time.\n—Right, if he uses chanting.\nPlease make it in time!\nBut Monica quickly invoked her wind with her no chant spell.\nBy calculating the position of the wood and the angle at which it will fall, Monica was able to slightly shift the position at which the wood will fall with minimal force.\n\"Kyaaaah!?\"\nThe sound of rattling wood toppling over coincided with Casey's scream.\nA cold sweat ran down Monica's back.\nDid I make it in time?\n\"Treasurer Norton! Miss Casey! Are you alright!?\"\nCyril's expression changed as he rushed over to the two. Monica nodded stiffly and went over to Casey on shaky legs.\nSlumped on the floor, there were no visible injuries to Casey. The wood all toppled down away from Casey's body, just as Monica had calculated. But her face was completely pale as she's shaking.\n\"A-Are you okay…?\"\nMonica addressed her, and Casey nodded without words in trembling.\n\"You two, you're not hurt, are you!?\"\nCyril came running up to us and looked at Monica and Casey alternately to see if they were injured.\nNeedless to say for Monica, Casey was not injured. Still, Cyril ordered them to go to the infirmary, just to be safe.\n\"I'll take charge of this place. In some cases, I may need to press the supplier for the cause of this accident. You two should rest in the infirmary.\"\n\"O-Okay.\"\nMonica reached out to the slumped Casey and asked, \"Can you stand up?'.\nCasey nodded once, took Monica's hand, and stood up staggeringly.\nMonica bit her lip as she looked at the rope that had been bundling the wood, took Casey's hand, and walked away.",

      "content": "Casey was the kind of girl who always had a lively smile. She was like a caring and dependable big sister who would take Monica's hand to guide her.\nNow Casey was walking next to her while clinging onto Monica's hand. The hand she held was moist and cold with sweat, and she could tell that she was shaking slightly.\nAs Monica stared at her hand, Casey smiled unreliably with a pale face.\n\"Sorry, I showed you something embarrassing.\"\n\"N-No, I mean, after what happened… who wouldn't?\"\n\"Haha, I guess so…\"\nCasey smiled awkwardly as if she was trying to smile like she usually did but failed.\nThe way she laughed, her pale face, and her unreliable, shaking hands… they cut into Monica's heart.\nThe two were walking across the corridor of the east school building. There was still some distance ahead before they could reach the infirmary.\nMonica bit her lip, then slowly opened her mouth.\n\"The rope used to bind the wood… had a cut mark made with a blade.\"\n\"What, then… that wasn't an accident… was there a cut in the rope from the start? Did someone from the supplier had intended to take someone's life?\"\nAt Casey's words, Monica shook her head.\n\"No, if you paid close attention to the cut of the rope, the blade was inserted halfway into the rope… the rest was left for it to cut naturally… I've got that result from my calculation. If you put a cut of that depth in the rope, it takes only a few seconds for the rope before it completely tears off…\"\n\"I don't know the exact weight of the wood, but from what I estimated\" announced Monica, then followed by her speculation.\n\"it would snap after five to fifteen seconds elapsed.\"\nThey could leave a cut in that rope before it was completely torn off in ten seconds.\nIn other words, the rope wasn't cut before it was brought to the school, but someone put a cut in it on the spot.\nAnd Monica also knew. For outsiders to enter this school, they would be examined before the school gives them permission. Let alone knives, even bringing a single pair of scissors was not allowed. So to get all the necessary tools, they must submit a request before they could borrow it from the school.\n\"…and since people from suppliers weren't allowed to bring in knives, the one who cut it can't be them.\"\nIt made the expression on Casey's face disappeared. And yet, Monica still staring at her shaking sweaty hands.\nAnd then, Monica gulped and said.\n\"…did you cut the rope, Casey?\"\nCasey instantly tore away her hand from Monica's.\nShe then walked a few steps ahead of Monica to stop suddenly before turning her body around to look back at her.\nWhat appeared on her face was the same cheerful smile as always.\n\"Haha, I guess you caught me… yeah, I did it.\"\nTo her surprise, Casey confessed easily, then pulling a small craft knife out of his pocket and flashing it at her.\nAt which made Monica let out an ‘ah' voice.\n\"…why?\"\n\"To tell you the truth, I hate you, Monica. Actually, I was planning to make those woods fell on you as a prank, or so I thought. But then I screwed up and the wood fell on me. Oh, man, I am totally screwed up, am I?\"\nCasey's tone of voice and the way she laughed might have made her think looked as usual. However, there was something about her behavior that she couldn't shake off. Casey's words sounded strange, it was like she spoke the lines she had memorized.\nShe was speaking faster than usual, and her eyes never looked straight at Monica.\nCasey was lying.\n\"…I know you're lying.\"\n\"I'm not lying. I've hated you since the first time I saw you.\"\nCasey's words stab into Monica's heart.\nWhenever the word \"hate\" used, it always ended up hurts people's hearts. If it was the usual Monica, she might have running away in tears.\nBut the discomfort feeling felt stronger in Monica's chest.\n\"Casey, are you hiding something from me?\"\n\"I have nothing to hide, really. I just hate you. That's the only reason I was trying to harass you.\"\nCasey lifted the edge of her lips slightly in a snarl and looked at Monica with a very nasty look on her face.\n\"Do you remember the previous tea party, when your tea leaves were dumped down?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"The truth is I was the perpetrator.\"\nThe tone of her voice was easy-going without a hint of guilt. Yet, Monica did not feel any anger. What welled up inside was only the sense of discomfort and sadness.\nIn which, Monica lowered her eyes then muttered a few words.\n\"…I know.\"\n\"What?\"\nCasey blinked in surprise, and then Monica clutched the hem of her uniform and said.\n\"In the past, I've been bullied, and many of my things have been hidden from me… ever since that, I've never written my name on my personal belongings.\"\nAt that time, Casey gave Monica a piece of paper to mark the tea can she had put on the shelf. Casey had written her name on the paper, but Monica hadn't, fearing that someone would throw hers away.\nSo, she folded the edge of the paper to mark it in a way that only she could understand.\n\"… at the time, the only person who watched me fold the paper… was you, Casey.\"\nBeing timid and cautious, Monica made sure to hide the paper with her own body to prevent anyone from seeing it, whenever she was folding the paper or putting the can on a shelf.\n…In other words, the only person who knew which's Monica's tea can was Casey.\nSince Casey didn't have any servants, she had to make the tea on her own, so she left shortly into the preparation room before Monica's turn. She probably did dump down Monica's tea leaves at that time.\nAt Monica's remark, Casey looked dumbfounded, but eventually brushed back her bangs and smiled hollowly.\n\"Ahaha, I knew it, you're very smart.\"\n\"………\"\n\"I see… so you've known all along. If I think about it, you always speak casually to Lana, but always used honorific when talking to me. I guess you've been wary of me…\"\n\"Even so, you have helped me a lot lately… so I thought… maybe all of it just a misunderstanding.\"\nWhen Monica was devastated because her tea leaves were dumped down, Casey kindly gave her own tea to use.\nAfter that event, she's been inviting Monica to eat lunch together and showed her concern for her in any way she could.\nThat's why Monica had always turned her eyes away from the truth. She tried to convince herself that there must have been some misunderstanding.\n\"Hey, Monica. Do you still remember the things we talked about in the cafeteria? The one where my father told me to go catch His Highness' eye…\"\n\"I do.\"\n\"The truth, I really want to become His Highness's wife and the future queen. So I thought that if I befriended you, Monica, whom His Highness is very fond of, I would have more chances to get close to His Highness. That's why I started being nice to you and pretending to be your friend… Haha, I am so terrible, right?\"\nCasey's words seemed to make sense.\nHowever, an uncomfortable feeling was still stuck in Monica's chest and would not come off.\nMonica wasn't very good at dealing with people. So until now, she had never really looked at the person in front of her.\nHowever, since coming to this school and coming into contact with many people, Monica has learned to \"get to know others\" just a little bit.\nThat's why she was certain. Casey was hiding something from her.\nBut unable to figure out what that \"something\" was, Monica clutched the chest part of her dress in frustration.\nWhat's Casey hiding?\nIf I don't find out soon, there will be no turning back for her\nAs Monica was getting impatient with this premonition, one of the windows in the hallway opened with great force and a man jumped in.\n\"Monica!\"\nIt was the first floor, nonetheless, a young man with black hair jumped in through the window —it was Nero in human form.\nWhenever Nero transformed into a human, he always wore an old-fashioned robe, but now he was wearing the uniform of a male student of Serendia Academy.\n\"Ne… ro…? W-What's wrong with your outfit?\"\n\"Oh, doesn't it look nice? If I were a cat, I'd be picked out of the school building, and if I wore my usual robe, I'd look suspicious, so I made put a little of my mana to make something. At first, I imagined your uniform, but I accidentally ended up with a skirt, so I had to start all over again… wait, that's not the point.\"\nNero turned his sharp gaze to the west and promptly stated.\n\"There is some kind of strange mana reaction in the west warehouse. And it's getting stronger by the moment.\"\nCasey was stunned by the mysterious man who appeared in from the window, but as soon as she heard his words, she quickly turned pale.\nMonica immediately activated her mana-sensing spell without chanting.\nIn the opposite direction from the east side of the school building where they were, was a warehouse to the west. Sure enough, there was a mana reaction there.\nIt sucked up a small amount of mana from its surroundings to expand gradually.\nIt has fire attribute, the way it absorbs and compresses mana of its surroundings, and this inwardly swirling flow of mana is… it can't be!\nMonica had once seen this unique flow of mana in a class on Minerva's magic tools.\nA magic tool for assassination with extremely high killing power. Its name was…\n\"…[Cocnh Flame].\"\nThe moment Monica uttered these words, Casey's eyes widened as she let out a faint voice.\n\"How could Monica know about [Conch Flame]…?\"\nThe moment she heard that murmur, all of Casey's behaviors so far were linked together.\nAt the west warehouse, fireworks were being brought in. Felix and Elliot were supervising the process.\nSince Casey was approaching Monica and pretending to be her friend. Her real reason should be…\n\"…Casey, Is your goal… to assassinate His Highness?\"\nCasey didn't give an answer.\nBut her tense face told Monica everything.",

      "content": "The fireworks used in school festivals were divided into two main types: those that will be launched into the sky periodically, and those that will be used in the play. While the former would be brought in the day before the festival, the latter would be brought in first as it would be used for rehearsals.\nIn addition to student council members Felix and Elliot, Miss Mabel Haynes, who was also responsible for stage direction, was present at the delivery. The fireworks used in the play will be handled by specialized companies, but even those who were responsible for the play need to know how to handle them.\nMabel Haynes was a third-year student who gave the impression of being a smart person. Though she usually read books quietly with her glasses on, when she was involved in the play she was famous for her eyes would be blazing like a different person.\nAnd now, such a girl was approaching Felix, who was supervising bringing in the goods, said ‘Your-High-Ness' in a sweet voice that did not hide her flirtation.\n\"Have you thought about what I said the other day?\"\n\"Oh, the thing about me taking part in the play? I thought I turned you down last time.\"\n\"I did say, ‘please give it some thought'. But you haven't given any refusal of the thought itself. So I can take it as you're still thinking about it!\"\nMable spoke her quibble as she glaring at Felix with her blazing eyes.\nThe pressure Mabel exuding was so strong, even Elliot, who was checking the list next to her, silently distanced away from Felix.\n\"I am aware of your busy schedule as a member of the student council. But only a little bit, juuuust a little bit, please. Take in part of the last scene, juuuuust the last scene of the Founder King, I hope you could you take that role, Your Highness.\"\n\"The play would not be perfect if the person who had been playing the role up to that point changed into me when the final scene came.\"\n\"Thaaaat's not true. I'm sure everyone who sees the play will break down in tears with cheers. I can even hear the sounds of the crowd cheering and applauding like the earth is about to break!\"\nWhat an exaggeration…, thought Felix as he brushed off Mabel's claims.\nMabel always kept her manner composed. But, when the play involved, she will talk too much.\n\"If I can be honest with you, I wanted you to play the role of the Founder King, Lord Ashley to play Sheffield, the Spirit King of the Wind, Lady Graham to play Lurchela, the Spirit King of the Water, and Lord Elliot to play Arklade, the Spirit King of the Earth… I wonder why is our student council members are so gorgeous. Simply having them standing on the play was enough to leave huge impressions! I'm sure of it!\"\nFelix pretended not to hear and continued to check the crate silently.\nMabel walked around to the front of Felix and looked up at him with a look that was even hotter than that of a maiden in love.\n\"Would you please reconsider? Even Lady Eliane, who's got the role of the queen, also expressed her desire for you to play the role.\"\n\"…\"\nEliane. The moment that name came up, Felix's blue eyes darken just a little bit.\nBut as his gentle smile remained intact, he then told Mabel.\n\"Maybe I will give you a formal response here. We, the student council members, are not allowed to participate in any play. If you're still insisting any longer, I'll have to consider it as an attempt to disrupt the work of student council.\"\nAt the strong words of refusal, Mabel let out an unladylike \"ugh\" and bit down on her handkerchief.\nIn response to Mabel, Felix retracted his harsh attitude and gave her a gentle smile.\n\"I am sure the play will be a success even without me involved. I hope it will become a great play that will live up to my expectations.\"\nWith that being said, Mabel couldn't insist any longer.\nMabel could only nod her head before letting out a deep sigh.\nAs Felix went back to his work after successfully dealt with Mabel, Elliot, who had been watching from a distance, came back to join him.\n\"It was quite a feat to smart out the talk with Miss Mabel. As expected of Your Highness… but are you sure about it? Miss Eliane was hoping you'd be the prince, wasn't she?\"\nEliane was Felix's distant relative whom Felix's grandfather, Duke Crockford, was considering her to be his official fiancee.\nBut Felix shrugged lightly, not caring deep down what he felt.\n\"Ignoring one of the three most beautiful ladies in the school, what an enviable situation is this.\"\nThings that he hadn't intended, leaked out in a murmur as he looked down at his list.\nIt's not because Felix disliked having his potential fiancee prepared by Duke Crockford. He just has no interest in them.\nThinking about it, the things that Duke Crockford prepared were always things that he had no interest in.\nWhether it was his fiancee candidate or the bright future that laid unfold by before him… All the things that were prepared for ‘Felix Ark Ridill', he had no interest in them.\n…Regardless what I've become, I must become a king.\nNo matter if they call him Duke Crockford's puppet or not.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"…I can't let Duke Crockford's puppet… be king.\"\nCasey spoke in a strained voice.\nThe absence of her usual vivacious smile on her face, replaced by dark despair emitted in her eyes.\nWith a slight tinge of sadness in her despair, Casey pointed the tip of her thin knife at Monica.\nFinally, She had understood.\nThe reason Casey had toppled down the lumber in the east warehouse and caused an accident she had staged on was to create an alibi.\nIf two incidents occurred on the same day in two different places, most people would assume that both incidents were the work of the same person who wanted to assassinate Felix.\nSo, by getting involved in one of the cases, she can avoid the suspicion of the people from her surrounding.\nIf the toppled woods had succeeded to cause Casey injuries, no one would think that Casey was the culprit.\n…but why do you have to do such dangerous things…\nOne wrong move and she would have been crushed to death by the wood.\nCasey's desperate attempt to walk the tightrope sent a chill down Monica's spine.\nCasey… why did you have to go that far…\nWhy did Casey have to go that far to take Felix's life?\nShe went as far as carrying dangerous magic tools. Even faking an accident on purpose to create an alibi.\nTo Monica's bewilderment, Casey laughed wryly, her face turning to despair.\n\"If His Highness Felix becomes the next king, Duke Crockford, who stands behind him, will start a war with the Randall Kingdom. As the Duke's puppet, His Highness Felix will not be able to stop him.\"\nThe Kingdom of Randall—the birthplace of the First Prince's mother—was a small country situated between the Kingdom of Ridill and the Empire.\nFelix told her when they drank the chocolate together. He said that the First Prince faction had strong ties to the Randall Kingdom.\n…But Felix didn't say what kind of sentiments the second prince faction had for Randall.\n\"My hometown is bordered by the Randall Kingdom. It's always been hard for us because of all the damage caused by the dragons, but since we didn't have enough money, we can't rely on the other nobles.\"\nThe Dragon Knights, who work directly under the king, would take a while to arrive.\nAsking for help from neighboring nobles to sent their military power always cost an enormous fortune.\nSome of them, such as the Count of Kerbeck, able to provide military support to neighboring nobles, but with a cost. And to maintain an army need an enormous amount of money.\n\"… we had neither soldiers nor money. After all, our people and land had been exhausted from fighting the dragon. And the one who had helped us was the Randall Kingdom. For many generations, our family has been in contact with Randall Kindom… we had brought those people— the knight they had dispatched—to cross the border of the kingdom to help our hometown.\"\nOf course, bringing in the knights from the Randall Kingdom that dispatched secretly crossing the border of the kingdom was against the regulations between nations.\nBut for Casey and the others who lived in fear of the dragon, it would have been a blessing.\nThe kingdom's Dragon Knights were always dispatched to places that got the highest priority. It's not hard to imagine that the remote countryside with few financial resources was put on the back burner.\nNo wonder Casey felt so much more indebted to the Randall Kingdom than to her kingdom and neighboring nobles who would not help them.\n\"His Highness Felix's maternal grandfather, Duke Crockford, had been planning to initiate a war against Randall. Since the Duke has his sights set on the Empire, he intends to use Randall as a stepping stone.\"\nThe knife glinted ominously in Casey's hand.\nThe knife with its mirror-like polished surface showed Monica's frightened figure.\nCasey said to Monica with a dark smile.\n\"Do you think I would let them do that? Of course not, whether it's Duke Crockford or his puppet, the Second Prince.\"\n\"Is that why you set up [Conch Flame]… to assassinate him…?\"\nThe [Conch Flame] was a magic tool made for the purpose of assassination. Its size was about the size of a brooch that fits in the palm.\nOnce activated, it will absorb the mana of its surroundings to store it inside, and when the accumulated mana has reached a certain amount, it will burst the flames out.\nThe name [Conch Flame] came from the fact that flames would rotate at high speed like a screw, piercing through the target.\nWhat makes it unique was its high killing power. The flame of the [Conch Flame] can easily penetrate ordinary defensive barriers and leave the target full of holes.\nThe disadvantage of this tool was its limited effective range. The [Conch Flame] was very powerful, but it had a narrow range.\nBut what if it exploded in the warehouse where the gunpowder was stored? There would undoubtedly bring tremendous damage.\nThe thought made Monica paled, then Casey spoke.\n\"I don't know how did you know about the [Conch Flame]… I wish you hadn't known about it… if so, I wouldn't have to make a move to silence you.\"\nAfter Casey regained her grip on the knife, she closed the distance in an instant, aiming to slash Monica's neck.\nHowever, Nero stopped her attempt by grabbing Casey's arm and held her down. He then twisted her arm and yelled.\n\"Hey, Monica! This is no time to dawdle! We've got to do something with the west warehouse!\"\n\"………..\"\nVarious conflicts swirled in Monica's mind. Casey's words and despair caused Monica's thoughts to fray.\nAnd the only person who could resolve this situation was Monica.\nIf Monica doesn't do anything, a lot of people are going to die.\nAlthough the area of effect of the [Conch Flame] was narrow, there was no doubt that if the fireworks ignited, it would cause a huge catastrophe.\n\"The costumes for this year's play will be really amazing! After all, I supervised them myself!\"\n‘So you should watch the play,' it was what Lana told to Monica.\nI don't want it… to be ruined.\nMonica slowly raised her head and reached out to Casey, who was struggling against Nero's grip on her arm.\nThen, without chanting, a weak electric current flowed through into Casey's body, causing her strength to weaken, allowing the knife to slip from her hand.\n\"What… was… that…\"\nCasey probably had no idea what was going on. After all, the spell that Monica cast didn't use chant.\nAlthough Casey hadn't lost consciousness yet, since she was unable to move her numb body, she can't do anything but slumped down. After that, Nero carried her body lightly on his shoulder before glaring at Monica.\n\"Hey, that current tingled me as well, you know!\"\nIgnoring Nero's complaint, Monica pondered on how to overcome the situation.\nShould I use a voice amplification spell to alert the entire school to evacuate? No, I can't. My words are not convincing enough for everyone to believe me. How about using a wind spell to send only the [Conch Flame] into the sky? …no, it's a stationary magic tool, so it will be attached to the wall or floor, and since it has the property of absorbing the surrounding mana, if I am not careful, it will explode the moment I cast my spell.\nAs expected, the best option would be to trap the [Conch Flame] inside a barrier to suppress its flames.\nSince Monica can use remote spells, she can set up a barrier just at the right distance from her location.\nThe problem was the strength of the barrier.\nThe [Conch Flame] has enough destructive power to penetrate most barriers.\nIf I put all my magical power into it, I can reduce the strength of the [Conch Flame]… but that won't be enough. If I don't completely block it out, it will ignite the fireworks and cause a huge disaster… unless I can create a barrier as powerful as Louis'…\nAt that moment, an idea crossed Monica's mind like a revelation.\nMonica rushed over to the window and focused her mind.\n\"Oh, what are you planning?\"\nNero was looking at Monica with great interest.\nMonica then spoke to Nero.\n\"Nero, I'm going to attack the academy.\"\n\"…………what?\"\n\"Didn't I tell you before? When this school is attacked from the outside, Louis's defensive barrier will be activated. I want you to find out where the source of the spell when the barrier is activated.\"\nWithout waiting for Nero's reply, Monica created several powerful wind spear spells without chant.\nFundamentally, offensive spells usually generate around the caster before it flies towards the target.\nHowever, Monica used a higher level of \"remote spells\" to create wind spears outside the academy grounds to attack the academy with them.\nThis academy has a large protective barrier set up by Louis Miller of [Barrier Magician].\nWhen Monica unleashed her wind spears, Louis's barrier had recognized it as an ‘attack from the outside' and immediately wrap the entire school in a protective wall. The powerful barrier easily repelled Monica's wind spears.\nAs expected of the barrier that had needed [Barrier Magician] to set up for years. It has incomparable strength.\n\"Nero! Where is the source of the spell!?\"\n\"It's close from here. Oh, I think it's at the old garden.\"\n\"Bring me there!\"\nIn which Nero replied lightly with, \"Right away.\" As Casey was carried on his left shoulder, he had to carry Monica on the other shoulder.\nWith that, Nero lightly jumped over the window frame and started running towards the old garden.\nAs Nero was running at the speed which made it hard to believe that he was carrying two people at the same time, he asked Monica.\n\"So, what are you planning to do once you find out the spell location of that devil magician's barrier?\"\n\"I'm going to borrow Louis's barrier.\"\n\"Hah?\"\n\"I'm going to rewrite Louis's defensive barrier to contain that [Conch Flame].\"\nAt Monica's words, Nero blinked his golden eyes and looked at Monica.\n\"Is that… even possible?\"\n\"I've never done it before, so I don't know… but I have to do it.\"\nSqueezing her shaky hands, Monica said to herself.\n\"After all, I am the [Silent Witch].\"",

      "content": "Casey Groove had three older brothers, all of whom went off to slay dragons and never returned.\nHer eldest brother was grabbed by a wyvern and dropped from a high place. He died instantly from a broken neck.\nHer second brother was torn apart by the claws of the Red Dragon, and his corpse returned with missing limbs.\nHer third brother was burned to death by the Red Dragon's fire breath. He was buried in his armor, unable to remove his helmet and armor that melted into his seared skin.\nEvery time a dragon threat occurred, her father would request the kingdom to send out the Dragon Knights over and over again. However, they rarely arrived in time.\nCasey's hometown, Bright, was a barren land of little importance to the Ridill Kingdom. That's why the central nobles haven't paid any regard to it.\nIn fact, the more dragons there are in this land near the border, the less likely it is to be attacked by neighboring countries. Some even said that dragons were more useful than weak nobles as a line of defense—regardless of the people who lived in the land.\nAfter the dragon ravaged their land and took away their family, Casey and his family were on the brink of despair… but then the Knights from the Randall Kingdom came to their rescue. They rushed to the Bright territory in secret and struggled hard to exterminate the dragon.\nCasey's grandmother has a tie with the Marquis family of the Randall Kingdom, apparently, because of that connection, they had rushed over to help.\nOne can imagine how grateful Casey and the others were for that support when their country had abandoned them.\nSince then, Casey's father, Count Bright, and the noble of Randall have been in secret contact with each other, exchanging information about the situation in their countries.\nOne topic that often came up was Duke Crockford.\nThis man, the second prince's maternal grandfather and the most influential man in the Ridill Kingdom have his eyes set on war with the Empire, and he apparently wanted to invade Randall as a stepping stone to that goal.\nIf the second prince became the next king at this rate, that nightmare would become a reality.\n—Is there anything I can do?\nHe told Casey with a pained expression on his face.\n—You should go to Serendia Academy.\nIf she could catch Felix's eye and cajole him, that would be the best.\nBut if that's not possible…\n—Use this.\nHis father gave Casey a small magic tool to use… the [Conch Flame].\n＊ ＊ ＊\nWhat's going on?\nCasey was confused as she was carried on the shoulder of the dark-haired man.\nThis Nero guy, who was wearing a school uniform even though he was clearly at the age of a person who would attend school, was strange, but what even stranger was Monica.\nIt was surprising that Monica knew about the existence of the [Conch Flame], but when she also said that she would neutralize it was even more so.\nThat's not possible…\nCasey's father had told her how powerful the [Conch Flame] was.\nThe downside of the [Conch Flame] was its narrow effective range and its low accuracy. That's why she set it off at the moment when Felix was present for the bringing in of the fireworks.\nEven if the [Conch Flame] didn't hit Felix directly, the damage caused by fireworks should kill him for sure.\nThe man known as Nero easily jumped over the old garden gate and proceeded to the inner part.\nSince this old garden untended, it was covered full of weeds. At the center of the garden lies an old fountain.\nClimbing down from Nero's shoulders, Monica ran over to the fountain and peered into it. The now unused fountain was filled with puddles of rainwater and was covered with moss.\n\"This fountain has a magic formula carved into at the bottom… it was a large-scale barrier that protected the academy.\"\nMonica also squinted at the decorative carvings on the outside of the fountain.\n\"There's another layer of protective barrier around the large-scale barrier… probably to keep the barrier from being destroyed, he added another layer of protective barrier around the large-scale barrier…\"\n\"In other words, if you don't deal with the outer protective barrier, you can't tamper with the main large-scale barrier, right? …So what are you going to do?\"\nIn response to the dark-haired man's words, Monica declared in a voice without a hint of hesitation.\n\"I'll only break the outer protective barrier.\"\nCasey became more and more confused, wondering what Monica was talking about.\nShe might be a novice when it came to spells, but she could tell that what Monica was talking about was not something anyone could do.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nMonica stood in front of the fountain and focused her concentration. What she needed to do now was really simple.\nFirst, destroy the protective barrier that covers the outside of the fountain.\nNext, rewrite the formula of the large-scale barrier inside the fountain so it can be used against the [Conch Flame].\nThe outer protective barrier, which was triggered by any attempt to touch the inner large-scale barrier, was extremely strong and would not be destroyed by ordinary spells.\nIf so, Monica will only have to destroy it with all the power she has.\nMonica closed her eyes and quickly weaved a magic formula.\nThis magic formula was a very high-level spell that only a few people in the kingdom have mastered. Even Monica, who's got no chanting skill, needs more than ten seconds to complete it.\nOnce Monica completed her spell, she would only say the last chant out of awe and respect for the one she was about to summon.\n\"…Answer my call, O king of the shapeless guidance, show me a glimpse of your power.\"\nAt that moment, the rustling of all the trees stopped.\nThe wind calmed, the sound died away, and a white door appeared above Monica's head.\nCasey peeled her eyes open and Nero whistled merrily, \"You sure did it flashy.\"\n\"In the name of Monica Everett of the Seven Sages. Open the gate. I call upon you from the depths of silence… Sheffield, King of the Wind Spirits.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nIn Felix's breast pocket, Will was restless. Apparently, he was trying to tell him something.\nFelix left the area a little bit after giving a word to Elliot and hid behind a tree.\n\"Will, what's the matter?\"\n\"I apologize for interrupting your student council duties.\"\nThe white lizard peeked its head out of Felix's pocket and looked around restlessly.\nWhen Felix saw that Will was not acting normally, he asked again, ‘Will?' which made him look up at Felix and said.\n\"…a gate to summon the Spirit King has been opened somewhere around here.\"\n\"Are you saying someone used the Spirit King summoning spell?\"\n\"Yes. I believe this presence is Lord Sheffield, the Spirit King of the Wind.\"\nAt Will's words, Felix put his hand on his chin and pondered.\nIn the Ridill Kingdom, there were less than ten people who had made a contract with a High-Ranking Spirit. In addition, only about half of them could summon a Spirit King.\nCould one of the Seven Sages be nearby? If it's the one who specializes in wind magic… could it be Louis Miller of the [Barrier Magician]?\nSummoning the Spirit King was not a simple matter. It meant that a major battle or something similar was going on.\nHowever, there was no clamor or destruction to be heard in the surroundings.\n\"Will, be vigilant in the surrounding area for a while. Once I'm done with the loading, we'll take a look around the school.\"\n\"Understood.\"\nWith one nod, the white lizard went back into Felix's pocket.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nMonica could only keep the door to the Spirit King open for less than three seconds.\nBut it's enough to break a single barrier.\n\"Destroy it.\"\nAs if in response to her voice, a sharp blade of wind swung down from the gate. It was as if a huge machete had been wielded, and countless cracks appeared in the protective barrier around the fountain.\nAs the wind subsided and the gate closed, what left was the clearly shattered outer frame of the fountain.\n\"…what… was that? And just now… what do you mean… by the Seven Sages…\"\nCasey, who was being carried on Nero's shoulders, groaned in a shaky voice.\nWithout even glancing back at Casey, Monica climbed over the debris on the outer frame of the fountain and headed inside.\n\"…You're not the only one who's hiding something, Casey.\"\nThat was all Monica could say at the moment.\nFor now, there was still work to be done. Once the outer barrier has been destroyed, the next thing to do was to rewrite the main barrier—the large-scale defensive barrier that has been placed over the entire school.\nThe barrier magic formula engraved on the bottom of the fountain was so wonderful that Monica couldn't help but exhale in admiration. As expected of a barrier that Louis Miller of the [Barrier Magician] took his time to create. The delicate technique of constructing the barrier was similar to that of a first-class architectural technique. In a different sense, Louis was also a great genius like Monica. Although he has a bad personality.\nIt's got multiple anti-rewrite dummy formulas installed… but first, I need to disable them.\n\"Monica! Mana in the west warehouse is going bad! It's on the verge of bursting!\"\nRight now, Monica couldn't even hear Nero's voice.\nHer eyes were filled with complex and difficult magic formulas. Monica deciphered them as if she were solving a mathematical equation.\nDummy formula analysis complete. Specify the coordinates of the barrier. Change the barrier activation condition from \"attack from outside\" to \"attack from inside\". Limit to anti-fire attribute. Prevent the incoming oxygen. All that remains is to compress, compress, compress…\nThings that occurred now were not something flashy spell like the Spirit King summoning, but a plain and silent battle.\nAfter fully grasping Louis's protective barrier, Monica compressed it from one that protected the entire school to one that covered the [Conch Flame]. Since the [Conch Flame] was the size of a palm, the barrier needs to be compressed into extremely small.\nThen, the [Conch Flame] secretly set up under the shelves of the west warehouse exploded. The conch-like flames explode as if countless springs, packed to the very limit, were released all at once.\nNormally, the flames would have pierced the nearest person, ignited the fireworks, and wreaked havoc on everything it passed… but they were held back by the tiny barrier.\nNormally, barriers were designed to allow oxygen and other substances necessary to sustain human life. However, Monica purposely set up the barrier to prevent oxygen from passing through.\nIt's the same logic as putting a lid on an oil lamp to extinguish it. The [Conch Flame] that had lost its oxygen within the barrier quickly disappeared as if the intensity of the flame had been a lie.\nEventually, when she was sure the fire had completely extinguished, Monica let out a breath of relief.\n\"…neutralizing the [Conch Flame]… complete.\"\nAfter saying that, Monica flopped down on the spot.\nHaving summoned the Spirit King and rewrite the formula of the large barrier, Monica's mana was at its lowest point.\nAs Nero walked over to the fountain, he said to Casey, who was dumbfounded on his shoulder as if he's boasting.\n\"How is that, my master is awesome, right?\"",

      "content": "\"Monicaaaa. Are you aliiiive?\"\nMonica, who was turned her body over in the fountain, responded in a faint voice in her heavy breath.\n\"…some…how…\"\n\"Wow, that's amazing. You've drained almost all of your mana.\"\n\"…yeah, I haven't… used this amount of mana… in a long time.\"\nSpeaking of her combat style, Monica usually used minimum consumption of mana to shoot enemies down with precise control.\nHowever, in order to destroy the barrier created by Louis Miller, she had no choice but to use the most powerful spell she could use.\nSummoning the Spirit King had cost 70 to 80 percent of Monica's total mana. It's not something that can be used casually.\nRight now, she just wanted to let this exhaustion take over and fall asleep, but she still had things to do.\n\"…I guess it was my loss…\"\nOn Nero's shoulder, Casey smiled helplessly.\n\"Casey…\"\nMonica slowly raised her heavy body to look up at Casey.\nCasey looked neither hateful nor angry, only smiling sadly as if he had given up on everything.\n\"Why do you look like that? I was the bad guy who's deceived you.\"\nThe only reason Casey had been so nice to Monica was to get closer to Felix. And it had worked well. Because of that, she was able to find out the schedules that the student council planned.\nThat's how Monica had been taken advantage of by Casey.\n\"…even so…\"\nMonica squeezed the bosom of her dress and began to frantically wring out her voice.\n\"You are the person who had invited me… whenever it was eating lunch or visiting elective courses… and it makes me happy.\"\nEven if her reason was to take advantage of Monica, she still couldn't hate Casey.\nThe girl who put the fried fish in bread, then ate it cheerfully as if tasted so delicious.\nThe girl who would casually mediate Claudia and Lana when they got into a fight.\nThe girl who said that she was good at embroidery then spread out a beautifully embroidered handkerchief, only to smile bashfully.\n\"…Please don't look at me like that, Monica.\"\nCasey closed her eyes and shook her head gently.\n\"I was the evildoer who tried to kill His Highness… you should properly hate me for that.\"\nTo what extent Casey's behavior was an act, Monica had no idea.\nStill, she didn't think all of that was a lie.\nAfter had attempted the assassination of the royal family, Casey and her family would end up being executed.\n………executed.\nMonica felt a chill run down her spine.\nAt that moment, Nero looked up at the sky and clicked his tongue.\n\"Hey, Monica. There's a bad guy coming here. I'll be hiding over there, you hear me?\"\nNero placed Casey, who was still too numb to move, down on the ground and quickly running away. Perhaps he tried to disguise himself as a cat behind a tree.\nShe knew that sooner or later since she had messed with the barrier without permission, \"that person\" would come.\nAlthough Monica was staggering on her foot, she still stood firm and looked up at the sky.\nFar away in the sky, a small black dot could be seen. It was approaching her way at a tremendous speed… did he even think about his landing?\nHad a bad feeling, Monica took a few steps backward.\nThen, just a few seconds later, two figures fell from the sky—spinning wildly as if they were going to pierce the ground.\nOne of the figures, a beautiful woman in a maid's uniform, spun around at high speed in an upright position and landed at a point where she was buried knee-deep in the ground.\nOn the other hand, the other figure behind her swung his staff and lifted his body just in time to avoid being buried into the ground.\n\"Daaaaaamn you, stupid maid! Didn't I tell you to fix that way of your landing?\"\n\"I named it the Rotating Landing Method. It is highly offensive and very stylish.\"\n\"There is no such thing as stylish when you're buried knee-deep in the ground, you damned maid!\"\nLouis Miller of the [Barrier Magician]—the man with braided chestnut hair with monocle—clicked his tongue loudly and stared down at Monica.\nThen he put his finger between his eyebrows and let out a deep sigh.\n\"I thought my barrier was in trouble, so I came to see what was going on…it was you, after all, my colleague.\"\n\"I-It's been a while, Louis.\"\nAfter Monica bowed her head, Louis bent over to look into Monica's face, giving her a quizzical look.\n\"…You've almost drained all of your mana? This is the first time I've seen you like this. Even when you've finished killing more than 20 wyverns hadn't made you in this state.\"\nLouis squinted his pale purple eyes behind his monocle and looked alternately at the destroyed fountain and the slumped-down Casey.\n\"Now, young lady over there, I take it you're a student at this school… Are you an enemy or an ally?\"\nWhen Monica clammed up, Casey said it with a casual tone.\n\"I am an enemy. A foolish enemy who tried to assassinate His Highness Felix, but failed.\"\n\"I see… Lynn, restrain her.\"\nAfter Louis gave his order, the beautiful woman in the maid's uniform pulled her buried knee out of the ground and restrained Casey by her hands behind her back. Casey did not give any resistance as she meekly did what was told.\n\"Now, my colleague. Can you explain the situation?\"\n\"A [Conch Flame] was set up in the west warehouse where the fireworks were being brought in.\"\nLouis frowned at the words of the [Conch Flame]. He, too, fully understood how terrifying that magic tool was.\nNot to mention the terrifying sight if those fireworks were burning nearby.\n\"… I figured my defensive barrier wouldn't be able to completely defend against it, so I borrowed your barrier, Louis.\"\n\"I am sure I had put up a decently sturdy protective barrier to cover the large-scale barrier.\"\n\"… I summoned the Spirit King to destroy it.\"\n\"I am sure I also had filled that the large-scale barrier themselves with dummy formulas to prevent anyone from tampering.\"\n\"Um, actually, I'm pretty good at detecting such things… ah, but it took me almost a minute to spot those dummies. It's true!\"\n\"… a minute? All of those things, you only took a minute…?\"\nMonica's words made Louis's face twitch.\nHe was silent for a while with a sunken face, but then he grunted with a bitter face.\n\"…If there are any incidents in the future where my barriers get altered, I will suspect you first and foremost.\"\n\"Eeeh!?\"\n\"I'm telling you it's not something anyone can do.\"\nHow could I believe that, damn it?! Monica thought she heard a very disturbing muttering at the end, but she pretended not to have heard it. Despite his refined demeanor, Louis Miller was a rather dangerous man.\n\"I understand the situation in general. Anyway, the Second Prince hasn't found out about your true identity yet, has he?\"\n\"Yes, he still doesn't know… I think.\"\n\"Very well. In that case, I will collect the [Conch Flame] for in your stead in secret. We will also take custody of that young lady. As for you, I'll have you continue to guard the second prince…\"\n\"W-Wait!\"\nMonica raised her voice to interrupt Louis's words.\n\"What is it?\"\n\"C-Casey… what will happen to her?\"\n\"We'll have her interrogated, and drag out every single person involved in the assassination. If she refuses to talk, we'll probably have to use some kind of mind-involving spells.\"\nThe use of spells to coerce a person into confessing or getting their mind to obey was strictly forbidden. However, under certain conditions, such methods were permitted if it was used for the interrogation of violent criminals.\nBut Monica knew. She knew that mind-involving spells could cause serious damage to the mind of the subject—in the worst case, she would become a vegetable.\nLouis could guess by Monica's complexion what she was trying to say, but he just gave her a cold look.\n\"… you seem reluctant to have her interrogated using mind-involving spells. But, she might be happier if she becomes a vegetable. When it comes to the attempt assassination of royalty, an execution is inevitable. It's better to be executed while she's losing her mind, so she doesn't have to suffer.\"\nCasey's face paled quickly.\nMonica gulped down the spit in her mouth and braced her trembling body to look straight up at Louis.\n\"L-Louis, you're in the First Prince faction, aren't you?\"\n\"… that's a bit out of the blue, what is it?\"\n\"Please… answer me.\"\nLouis looked at Monica's face probingly with his cunning eyes.\nThe [Silent Witch], who usually turned her head away immediately, was now looking straight up at Louis.\nThis fact caught Louis's interest suddenly.\n\"Yes, you're right. I'm a schoolmate of First Prince Lionel. I guess you could say that I am a member of the First Prince's faction. However, please don't misunderstand me. It is not that I want the First Prince to be the king no matter what.\"\n\"…Eh?\"\nMonica was expecting that he was going to say, \"His Highness Lionel is the most suitable person to be the next king!\" But to hear it different from what she thought was a bit of a letdown.\n\"I call myself a member of the First Prince's faction is because I don't like Duke Crockford and the Second Prince.\"\n\"………\"\nIt was a very Louis-like reason.\nBut the fact remained that Louis was a friend of the First Prince.\nAfter confirming this fact, Monica made her next move.\n\"C-Casey has ties to the Randall Kingdom, who is also the part of the First Prince's faction.\"\nLouis's eyebrows twitched.\n\"If the truth that the First Prince's faction, which is connected to the Randall Kingdom, plotted to assassinate the Second Prince is revealed, it will be a huge disadvantage for the First Prince's faction, right?\"\nJust by having the truth of the attempted assassination of the Second Prince was revealed, the First Prince's camp will be at an overwhelming disadvantage.\nWhen Monica pointed this out, Louis gave a thin smile.\n\"I never thought I'd see the day when you, a person who doesn't care about political struggles, would make a deal like that with me… how clever of you.\"\n\"Neither His Highness Felix nor anyone else knows about the assassination attempt. The only people who know about this were Casey and I.\"\n\"…so you want me to pretend that assassination attempt itself never happened?\"\n\"………\"\nShe didn't expect it to be considered never happened, Monica only wanted to prevent Casey's execution.\nAs Monica desperately persisted, Louis said in an admonishing tone.\n\"The First Prince's faction is not entirely united. Both the First Prince and his mother are, let's say, not interested in the throne. They would prefer to use fair methods than an attempt assassination… but not everyone who supports the First Prince is like that.\"\nCutting off his words, Louis glared at Casey with cold eyes.\n\"Fools who do unnecessary things like assassinating the Second Prince will be erased in secret.\"\n\"B-But, there should have been another way to handle things up in secret.\"\nMonica bit her lip tightly and stared at Louis with tears in her eyes.\nAt this moment, Louis Miller was secretly calculating.\nFor Louis, it would be better to cast a mind-involving spell on Casey to make her confess the name of the extremist group before erasing her in secret, so there would be no loose ends.\nBut if he did that, he would probably not be able to get Monica's cooperation in the future.\nThe strength of Monica Everett of the [Silent Witch] was far greater than she herself realized. It would be a shame to lose her cooperation.\nAfter weighing all the factors, Louis came to a conclusion.\n\"If the young lady confesses to everything honestly, I will promise not to use mind-involving spells. She shall be sent to a convent. Never again be allowed to appear in social situations.\"\nThat was the best compromise he could make.\nIn response, Monica bowed deeply to Louis.\n\"Thank you, Louis.\"\n\"In return, you will have to continue cooperating with the mission to protect the Second Prince…\"\n\"Yes!\"\nMonica nodded without hesitation, and Louis narrowed his eyes behind his monocle.\nOne of the reasons Louis chose Monica to be the second prince's bodyguard was Monica's distrust of people.\nA person who trusts others so easily will not be able to serve as a guard.\n\"……don't let yourself get too attached.\"\n\"Eh!?\"\nLouis put his index finger on Monica's brow and looked into her face.\n\"Remember, you are one of the Seven Sages, Monica Everett of the [Silent Witch]… and Monica Norton of the student of Serendia Academy is your temporary identity.\"\nMonica's shoulders jerked.\n\"…don't ever forget that.\"\n\"Y-Yeah.\"\nWhen Monica nodded, Louis stared down at her with a glint in his eye.\nLynn, who had been watching the scene in silence, had a strange thought like, ‘This scene's like that of child abduction.'",

      "content": "\"Lynn, escort that young lady to the Magic Corps Post nearby. Just mention my name, and they should offer you a room.\"\nAt Louis's instruction, Lynn, who had restrained Casey, nodded curtly.\n\"Certainly… Then, what about you, Master Louis?\"\n\"I need to deal with this barely intact barrier,\" said Louis as he pointed the destroyed fountain with his chin.\nThe barrier that Monica ‘borrowed' has been rewritten for use against the [Conch Flame], which was unable to protect the entire school anymore. He can't leave it as is, after all.\nMonica shrank back apologetically, and Casey, who was looking at her behavior, opening her mouth.\n\"Monica.\"\nThat word made Monica's shoulders jerked. She understood that this was going to be her last meeting with Casey.\nCasey would never be able to attend a ball or come back to this school again.\nBut Monica was stumped, looking at Casey with a lost look on her face not knowing whether to say sorry or goodbye.\nCasey was smiling with her eyebrows lowered as usual. As if the ‘Jeez' word could be heard from that smile.\n\"Monica, I'm not going to say ‘sorry' or ‘thank you'. I was your enemy who had attempted to assassinate the Second Prince.\"\n\"…………\"\n\"I'm not your friend, after all, so… please don't look at me like that.\"\nFor the first time, Monica felt like her heart had been gripped so hard.\nHer nose tingled. Her eyes were welled up.\nEventually, a sniff escaped from her lips, and a drop fell from the corner of her eye.\n\"You shouldn't cry over your enemies.\"\n\"B-But… *sniff*\"\n\"What a soft-hearted Seven Sages you are. If you keep on like that, someone will take advantage of you someday.\"\nThe exasperated tone was that of the usual Casey, caring and attentive.\n\"You should have to hate me properly. If you can't do that, please forget about me.\"\n\"N-No…\"\nMonica shook her head in frustration.\n\"…I have a good memory… So I will never… ever… forget you.\"\n\"What a troublesome Seven Sages you are…\"\nCasey was laughing, felt perplexed at her words.\nAs Monica was weeping and snotting bitterly, Casey turned her eyes to Lynn and said, ‘You can take me now.'\nLynn gave a small nod, and as soon as she did, a wind barrier wrapped Lynn's and Casey's bodies. It was some kind of flight spell that probably cast continuedly until reaching the destination.\nAfterward, their bodies softly float up.\nMonica was looking up at Casey with tears streaming down her face. But Casey didn't turn her face back. Instead, she kept looking at her front, before leaving a few words.\n\"Goodbye, Monica.\"\nIt was not the words addressed to Monica as the Seven Sages, but to the ordinary Monica.\nEventually, Casey's figure was becoming more and more distant.\nWhile Monica kept gazing up at the sky even until their figure was out of sight, Louis muttered to himself as he cleared the debris from the fountain.\n\"You should learn how to control your emotions in moderation.\"\n\"……I'm not good at that kind of thing.\"\n\"Then, just treat it as another people's problem.\"\nLouis was the only one who could do it without hesitation.\nAs Monica was sniffling snottily, Louis got up, pushed a clean handkerchief into Monica's face roughly, and went back to the fountain.\n\"Because of a certain magician, I am busy repairing the now broken barrier. If you don't want to help me, just go somewhere else. You can leave that young lady to us, we'll take care of it somehow.\"\n\"…what about this handkerchief.\"\n\"It's a precious gift from my wife. Don't forget to wash and iron it before you return it.\"\n\"…Okay.\"\nIn response to typical Louis behavior, Monica blew her nose before laughing bitterly.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAfter staying for a while so to let her reddened eyes become a little less swollen, Monica headed back for the student council room. Although her eyes were still a little red, Monica always kept her face downcast, so unless one looked closely, it would be hard to notice.\nDue to her empty mana, she was unable to walk straight, but she dragged her heavy body to the student council room and opened its door.\nShe saw all the members beside herself were already there. It's probably because all the duties to oversee the delivery were done.\nAs Monica was struggling to decide what kind of words to say, Felix turned his gaze to Monica in concern.\n\"Cyril told me the logs were collapsed. Are you and your friend alright?\"\n\"Y-Yes, we don't get any wound.\"\n\"All right. In that case, since there are no further duties today, we should end our activities today. Well then, I'll excuse myself first, I have some personal matters to deal with.\"\nMonica patted her chest in relief.\nSince her mana was almost empty, standing was all that she could.\nUgh… My head is all fuzzy…\nWhile Monica was struggling to keep her consciousness together, Neil looked at her with concern.\n\"Um, are you okay, Miss Norton?\"\n\"…….yeesh.\"\n\"Y-Your reply says the otherwise, though!\"\nAll the other student council members were starting to get ready to leave. Felix had left after said he had something to do, and Bridget was heading back to her dormitory after him.\nAs for Cyril, he needed to stay behind since he had to make sure the door was locked, while Elliot was glancing at Monica, but quickly turned away and left the room.\n…It's been so long since I ran out of mana, my sense was almost…\n‘Anyway, I have to get out of the room so as not to interfere with the locking of the door…,' so thought Monica absentmindedly as she moved her heavy feet.\nThen, suddenly, she bumped into something. It was too soft for a wall.\n\"…..Hey.\"\nSomehow she heard a voice above her head.\nBut more than that, Monica exhaled in comfort. The wall she leaned against made her regained her mana a little bit.\n\"M-Miss Norton. Miss Norton.\"\nNeil was shaking Monica's shoulders in a panic.\nWhen Monica muddleheadedly raised her gaze up, her eyes met Cyril's. In fact, it was Cyril Ashley's back that Monica was leaning against.\n\"I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I'm sorry! I-I'm a little spaced out.\"\nAnd then, Monica remembered.\nCyril Ashley has a constitution that allowed him to accumulate mana easily. That's why he used a brooch-shaped magic tool to release excess mana from his body.\nIn other words, Cyril's surroundings had a slightly higher concentration of mana than most.\nApparently, Monica's body, which was out of mana, was approaching Cyril, who had a lot of mana, on its own, in search of mana.\nI will be scolded for this, I will definitely be yelled at.\nMonica squeezed her eyes shut in preparation for the angry voice, but she didn't hear Cyril's shouting for any length of time.\nAs she peered up at him fearfully, Cyril's brow wrinkled, his mouth curved into ‘へ' line, and he had a complicated look on his face.\n\"……….Lord Cyril?\"\n\"……………………………………………\"\nCyril was hesitant to say anything, but eventually, he bowed his head vigorously with an expression of anguish.\nBoth Monica and Neil, who were standing beside him, were shocked by his behavior.\n\"I'm sorry.\"\nCyril apologized to Monica.\nMonica was baffled.\nPerhaps, she thought, his apology was not intended to me but to Neil, but Cyril's body was definitely facing Monica. Cyril was apologizing to Monica.\n\"Um, Lord Cyril, please raise your head. Wh-Why are you apologizing to me?\"\n\"…I was so preoccupied with checking the number of items brought in and did not check how well the rope was tied up. That accident was my mistake.\"\n\"B-But…\"\nCyril has done nothing wrong. It was Casey who had cut the rope in the first place.\nHowever, since Monica covered up for Casey, that accident ended up being Cyril's carelessness.\nWas it because of me all of this became Lord Cyril's fault?\nAs soon as she realized this, the blood drained from Monica's body.\nHer mind was jumbled with so many emotions that she couldn't think clearly.\n\"…But…Lord Cyril……. You have done…nothing wrong…\"\nThe moment she said it out loud, the tears that were supposed to have receded began to overflow. she couldn't stop crying, as if her tear glands had burst. Along with that came weeping and sniffling.\n\"…uwaaaah *sniff*…. uwaaaaaah….\"\nCyril and Neil were flustered when Monica suddenly started crying.\n\"H-Hey, Treasurer Norton.\"\n\"Miss Norton, um, p-p-p-p-please calm yourself.\"\nEven when Cyril and Neil tried to calm her, Monica's tears wouldn't stop.\n\"…Sowwy… uwaaaah… *sniff* I'm… soooowwwyyy…\"\nMonica slumped down on the spot and sniffed gaggingly.\nThey were not tears of sorrow, but tears of guilt.\n…I'm sorry for deceiving all of you. I'm sorry for telling you so many lies.\nWhile crouching down, she kept crying and crying… and eventually, Monica's consciousness fell into darkness.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"…D-Did she falls asleep?\"\n\"I-I guess she was tired after all that crying…\"\nMonica was snoozing in her sleep with a terrible face full of tears.\nCyril and Neil looked at each other, completely at a loss.\n\"…So, what did you call me here for?\"\nThe face of Claudia Ashley, who had been called into the student council room, was gloomier than usual, and now she was staring at her brother who was laying Monica down on the sofa. After that, Cyril said in an awkward manner.\n\"Please bring Treasurer Monica to her dormitory when she wakes up. We can't just bring her to the girls' dormitory, can we?\"\n\"…I'm not your servant.\"\nHis sister's harsh words made Cyril choke up, while Neil looked up at Claudia with a troubled face.\n\"Um, can I ask you… Miss Claudia?\"\n\"Please, that's nothing, Monica and I are best friends, after all. It's only natural to help your best friend get to her dorm.\"\nCyril's cheeks twitched at the sudden change of heart, but he swallowed his anger when he saw Monica sleeping peacefully on the couch before dropping his own jacket over her.",

      "content": "After leaving the student council room, Felix made sure no one was around before poking his finger in his breast pocket.\nAfter the white lizard Will poked his head out of his pocket, Felix spoke in hushed tones, keeping a wary eye on his surroundings.\n\"Earlier, you said that the Spirit King was had been summoned?\"\n\"Yes, I felt the gate for summoning the Spirit King being opened in this vicinity.\"\n\"Okay, then sneak into the teacher's room and see if there's been any talk of it among them.\"\nNo matter how much of a student council president he was, it would seem unnatural for him to be entering the teacher's room without proper reason. Then, entrusting it to Will, who can invade discreetly, would be the right choice.\n\"What are you going to do, Your Highness?\"\n\"I am going to take a look around, to see if there's anything out of the ordinary.\"\n\"Understood. If you encounter any problems, please summon me immediately.\"\nWill crawled out of Felix's pocket, then slithered down before moving quickly through the hallway to the staff room.\nAfter Felix saw him off, he went outside the school building himself. Since he hadn't mastered a sensing spell, he had to rely on his intuition to look something amiss… but there was one place he really wanted to check first.\n——It was the old garden. The place where he met Monica for the first time.\nFelix was aware that the fountain in the old garden contained a large-scale barrier that protected the entire academy. In fact, he went out of his way to duplicate the key to the old garden, because he was interested in its magic formula.\nThe magic formula in the large-scale barrier that Louis Miller of the [Barrier Magician], one of the Seven Sages created was, a work of art even to the amateur eye.\nSuch complex and elaborate magic formulas were not something one can see very often.\nAnd if there was an emergency situation where the Spirit King had to be summoned… or there was an attack on the school from the outside, the barrier should have been activated.\nIn any case, it would be a good idea to check the barrier first.\nWith that in mind, Felix headed for the old garden and took out the key he had secretly duplicated earlier to open the door.\nCome to think of it, I forgot to ask how that little squirrel managed to slip through this door.\nMaybe there was another secret passage that only Monica knew about.\nAs Felix walked forward, thinking about this, he felt a person's presence ahead of him, so he stopped in his tracks.\n… There's someone near the fountain?\nHe then crouched behind the tree to hide his presence before peeking out toward the fountain. And saw a man in a robe working on something in there.\nThe one working on it was a young man with chestnut hair in a braid wearing a monocle. Felix was familiar with his face.\n… Louis Miller of the [Barrier Magician]? Why is he here?\nIf he was going to do a regular inspection on the barrier, he should have contacted the school beforehand. But Felix has not heard of such notice.\nAnother thing that bothered him was the outer frame of the fountain, which was broken into pieces.\nThe outer frame of the fountain is supposed to have a barrier that protects the large-scale barrier… and it's broken? What sort of situation is this?\nLouis was inside the fountain, chanting repeatedly, seemingly adjusting the barrier.\nThen a strong wind softly sweeps over the area, bringing a young woman in a maid's uniform down from the sky.\nHe had heard that Louis Miller had made a contract with a High-Rank Wind Spirit. Perhaps that woman was the one.\n\"Master Louis, I've completed the escort.\"\n\"Alright. Then, go retrieve the remains of the [Conch Flame] from the west warehouse.\"\n\"Wow, you sure like to use your spirit roughly.\"\n\"I can't keep my hands off this one. This barrier… I almost had to rebuild it from scratch. I know it was used to neutralize the [Conch Flame], but that's pretty reckless.\"\nFelix frowned upon hearing this conversation.\nHe had heard of the term [Conch Flame] before. It was the name of an assassination tool with extremely high killing power.\n…that thing was placed in the west warehouse?\nNot long ago, it was none other than Felix who was in the west warehouse.\nFrom their conversation, someone had attempted to kill me, and Louis Miller secretly protect me, I suppose?\nHowever, from the way Louis described it, he didn't seem to be the one who neutralized the [Conch Flame].\n…then, who was it?\nFelix held his breath to focus on the conversation between Louis and that woman.\nLouis looked down at the fountain with a weary face before letting out a sigh.\n\"This fountain can't be fixed anymore… well, the academy will probably just think it's broken over time… but to summon the Spirit King just for the sake of protecting the Second Prince…\"\nLouis ruffled his neatly trimmed chestnut hair and blurted out.\n\"Lady [Silent Witch] is being reckless, really.\"\n……….What?\nFelix's heart jumped at the name that came out of Louis's mouth.\n[Silent Witch] summoned the Spirit King? To protect me?\nA scene from a few months ago came back to Felix's mind.\nA flock of wyverns shot through the eyebrows. Their huge bodies fluttering down silently like snow.\nThat magic was so quiet and beautiful.\nAnd now, its wielder, [Silent Witch], summoned the Spirit King?\nTo protect Felix?\n…Looks like it's the truth.\nFelix's heart raced in excitement as if he were a young child discovering the existence of a shooting star for the first time.\nHow majestic and beautiful would be the sight of that beautiful magician summoning the Spirit King?\nWas [Silent Witch] still nearby? Did she just happen to be passing by? Or has she been infiltrating the school for some time? From what I've seen of her at the ceremony, she's a small figure, but… wait, that alone can't determine that she's a woman. The [Thorns Witch], one of the Seven Sages, also bears ‘witch' in his title, but that person is a man, and it might be possible that the [Silent Witch] is also a man. Then, there's also a chance that she's infiltrated into the middle-grade section… No, she could have infiltrated as a teacher as well. Wait, calm yourself. She might not have been infiltrated, but just happened to be passing by.\nUnlike any other time, he felt his thoughts running ahead of him.\nThat's how much Felix admired the [Silent Witch].\nI want to see her. I want to meet her. I want to see her use her no-chant magic, if only once.\nFelix couldn't help but press his hand to the upturned corner of his mouth.\nHe heaved a huge breath as he pressing down his mouth with his palm, he felt his cheeks flush in a way that was uncharacteristic of him.\nThat was just like a little boy who is searching for his first love.\nI might have finally found it.\nFelix squeezed his chest, which was throbbing, over his uniform.\nSomething I am truly interested in.",

      "content": "For some period of time, Monica had forgotten how to understand human speech.\nWhen her father died, her uncle took her in, and Monica lived in fear of him every day.\nHer uncle hated Monica's father—no, you could say he loathed him.\nWhenever her uncle spoke ill of her father, Monica desperately tried to refute him. It wasn't my father's fault, she said.\nSo every time Monica opened her mouth, her uncle would throw his fist at her.\nShut up. Stop talking nonsense.\nHis fists would swing down along with his curses. In the worst cases, she would get kicked in the stomach and beaten with a chair. Sometimes meals were taken away from her, which was not uncommon.\nWhenever she went out, people in town would talk behind her back. All they whisper was how bad her father was.\nHer mind and body were slowly being worn down little by little.\nGradually, Monica found herself escaping into the world of numbers when times were tough.\nWhen her uncle beat her, or when she was forced into the barn in the middle of winter, Monica would just repeat in her head the formulas from the books she read in her father's study. In this way, she can forget the pain in her body and the cold of winter.\nAfter some time of escaping into the world of numbers, Monica's perception began to become distorted.\nAt first, she couldn't recognize people's faces anymore.\nThe size of the eyes, the width of each eye, the angle of the corners of the eyes, the length, width, and height of the nose, the angle of the chin… she can recognize these in numbers, but she cannot recognize them as a human face. To Monica, a person's face was nothing but a mass of numbers.\nNext, she could no longer recognize human expressions.\nWhen her uncle got angry, his eyebrows would move this much, his mouth would open this much, the angle of his mouth would change by this many degrees, his eyebrows would move this many times in three seconds—everything would be converted into numbers.\nHowever, Monica could not recognize the \"anger\" that her uncle's face meant. All Monica could understand was the number of how many parts of his face had moved.\nHer uncle had kicked the desk, and the desk moved this much, so the amount of force needed to move… and so on as her mind began to calculate the numbers.\nBut Monica couldn't understand why her uncle had kicked the desk.\nAll Monica could understand was the numerical value of the force needed of the kicked desk.\nBy the end of it, she couldn't recognize human speech.\nShe could understand what her uncle was saying, but her mind could not perceive the meaning of his words. Since she can't understand what was being said, Monica combined the number of sounds into a mathematical equation, calculated it, and let the result leak out of her mouth.\nWhen his uncle saw Monica mumbling those numbers, he kicked her, saying she was creepy.\nNot recognizing what had been said to her, Monica calculated how many seconds it would take for her nosebleed to coagulate.\nAnd so, by the time a year had passed since her uncle took her in, Monica had become so broken that she could not recognize anything but numbers.\nShe simply immersed herself in the world of beautiful formulas that never hurt her, turned her eyes away from reality.\nHer body grew to the point where it was barely able to survive, and her originally thin body became as thin as a stick.\nIn such a situation, a woman reached out to Monica.\nShe was Hilda Everett, a mid-thirties woman in glasses with short auburn hair who used to be her father's assistant.\n\"I've been looking for you ever since Dr. Rayne died.\"\nHilda said in a calm voice as she covered Monica, who was freezing after being kicked out of the house by her uncle, with her own scarf.\nBut Monica can't perceive those words. All she could understand were the numbers.\nAs she muttered the exact number of letters of the words she had heard and applied them to the equation, Hilda smiled softly and stroked Monica's cheek.\n\"So Dr. Raine had taught you the formulas… and at your age, you're already so proficient on it.\"\n\"………….\"\n\"You don't deserve to be here. Come with me, Monica.\"\n\"………Monica?\"\nWhen was the last time someone called me by my first name? wondered Monica at that word. After all, her uncle never called her by name but \"trash\" or \"dimwit\".\nShe hadn't heard his father's name in a long time, since everyone had treated it as a taboo to be spoken.\nHer own name, her father's name, brought Monica's consciousness, which had been wandering in the world of numbers, to the surface.\n\"…my name… the name my dad gave me… Monica Rayne.\"\nHilda hugged the bruised and battered Monica, looking like she was about to cry.\n\"Dr. Rayne would be very sad to see you like this.\"\n\"…Dad… Dad… Dad…\"\nThat person didn't punch or kick her when she uttered the word \"dad\".\nShe just mourned her father's death and hugged Monica affectionately. That brought her so much happiness.\n\"My dad wasn't wrong… my dad was… my dad was…\"\n\"I know. Dr. Rayne was an outstanding man.\"\n\"My father was burned… and all of his study… all of them…\"\nAs Monica's body quivered, Hilda's arms tightened around her body.\nThat alone was enough to convey how sad this woman was over the death of her father.\n\"*sniff* *sniff* uwaaaaaaaaaahhhhh…. Daaaad…\"\nMonica cried aloud for the first time in a long time in Hilda's arms.\nThat scene was like that of a whimpering young child.\nThe next day, Monica became the adopted daughter of Hilda Everett, a researcher at the Magic Institute, who later discovered her talent for magic and sent her to Magician Training Institute Minerva.\nAnd this story took place about five years ago when Monica was still twelve years old.",

      "content": "Barney Jones was the second son of Count Anvard, a historic and prominent family in the southwestern part of the Ridill Kingdom.\nIn noble society, the second son or younger was always treated as a spare for his older brother. No matter how incompetent or stupid the older brother was, he will always be the one to inherit the family.\nBarney was aware that he was better than his brother. And, in reality, he was like that. After all, his grades in academics were good enough to impress his tutor, and above all, he had a talent for magic. However, the one who would inherit the family was not him of the second son, but his older brother.\nThat was why he enrolled in Minerva, the best institute for training magicians.\nWhat he was aiming for was not just an advanced magician level, but the Seven Sages, the peak magician in the Ridill Kingdom.\nOnce he became one of the Seven Sages, he will receive the title of Count Magician, which was equivalent to the rank of Count. It was a very high rank that grants you to have an audience with the king.\n… that way, even Barney as the second son, would have a chance to prove his achievements to his father and brother.\nSo Barney studied hard, and thanks to his hard work, he was ranked first in both classroom and practical skills.\nI'm not like my brother. I have my talents.\nHe believed that even if he was the second son, he could find his own path to success.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nIt was when Barney was thirteen years old.\nWhen he returned from the study tour, he found one female student surrounded by several male students in the corner of the classroom. A recently enrolled female student named Monica Everett, a.k.a. the [Mute Everett].\nShe was a petite girl with a doll-like expressionless face, always silent and downcast. Apparently, the boys were intrigued by Monica's inability to speak and were trying to toy with her. They were excited to see who could make Monica talk.\nOne of the boys picked up a spider from the windowsill and brought it close to Monica's face. Monica remained downcast and did not react at all.\n\"Hey, pry this guy's mouth open! I'm gonna shove this in her mouth! I bet she'd scream if I did!\"\nIn response to the boy's voice, the other boys reached for Monica's face… but those hands were pulled back just before they could.\nThe boys' cuffs were burning with puffs of smoke.\n\"Aaaahh! Wh-What is this!?\"\n\"What are you planning to do with her?\"\nThe boys clicked their tongues blatantly when Barney said coldly, after unleashing his fire spell\n\"We're in the good part. Don't interrupt us, honor student.\"\n\"Your behavior is so unbecoming of a noble… You should be ashamed of yourself.\"\nThe boys snapped when he said this while lifting the rim of his trademark glasses.\nBut Barney didn't hesitate to use a shortened chant (quick spell) and surrounded the boys with flaming arrows.\nThe boys backed away with a wince, and Barney snickered at them.\n\"Do you really think you can beat a guy like me who's the best in practical skills?\"\nBarney was the sole genius in his grade who had mastered shortened chant. In the magic match, the speed of chanting plays a vital role. Therefore, no one could compete with Barney, who had mastered it.\nThe boys clicked their tongues and walked out of the classroom.\nBarney snapped his fingers to dispel the flaming arrows and turned his eyes to Monica.\n\"Can you stand?\"\n\"……………\"\nMonica was staring blankly at the floor with her olive eyes. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw the spider that the boys had thrown.\nEventually, as the spider began to scurry and escape out the window, Monica raised her eyes blankly to Barney.\n\"Thank…you…\"\nDespite her awkward speech, the [Mute Everett] seems to be able to speak properly.\nSecretly surprised by this, Monica continued with her words that were difficult to ignore.\n\"…for savng…that sprider.\"\n\"Wait a minute.\"\nWhy did it become like that?\nHe did not do that to save the spider, but Monica. He involuntarily squinted through his glasses to glare at Monica.\n\"Unfortunately, I hate bugs. So, what I saved was not a spider, but you.\"\nMonica blinked slowly in response and tilted her head to the side.\nShe pondered for a while as if searching for words, and then started to speak slowly.\n\"I'm…not afraid…of spiders.\"\n\"Hah?\"\nMonica's face remained expressionless as she mumbled to an astonished Barney.\nUpon looking at her again, he was struck by how expressionless she was.\nHer face was plain and simple, and if she smiled, she might be as charming as anyone else, but other than the occasional blink, her face hardly moved at all.\nMonica was silent with a blank expression, but eventually, she spoke in a whisper, hardly moving her mouth.\n\"…but I'm glad… that you saved…the spider… Because it would have been…pitiful…if it had gone into my mouth…\"\n\"What kind of logic is that?\"\nMonica nodded without expression when Bernie expressed his dismay.\nBernie scratched his cheek and asked a question that was bothering him.\n\"The way of you speak sounds so awkward. Did you come from another kingdom?\"\nMonica shook her head with a blank expression. Apparently, she was not a foreigner.\n\"I-I'm sorry… I've been practicing speaking…with my adoptive mother, but…\"\nHer words trailed off before taking a deep breath. It was as if a person who had forgotten how to speak had remembered how to breathe.\n\"I hadn't spoken…for a long time, so… I couldn't speak…fluently…\"\nShe hadn't been speaking for a long time… which meant there must be circumstances behind it.\nLooking at her pale face and body, which was too thin compared to Barney, who was the same age as her, he could somehow guess that her circumstances had been harsh in their own way.\nBarney bent down in front of Monica and reached out his hand.\n\"Can you stand?\"\nMonica widened her eyes and looked at Barney's hands.\nThen, she hastily squeezed the pocket of her uniform.\n\"Um…I don't have…a lot of money…\"\nBarney's cheeks twitched.\n\"Please don't look down on me. I'm a proud member of the Jones family. I would never extort money from you.\"\nBarney grabbed Monica's hand to help her to her feet, but she was still somewhat dazed, looked like a doll that had just been pulled by a puppeteer.\nHer eyes rounded slightly when Barney brushed the dust off Monica's robe. It was a very slight change in expression. However, he was strangely happy to see the change in the expression of this doll-like girl.\n\"You really are quite a handful, aren't you?\"\n\"I'm…sorry…\"\n\"You should be thankful for that, no?\"\nWhen Barney said that, Monica's lips moved slightly, murmuring.\nIt was too subtle to be called a smile, but the corners of her mouth were certainly lifted just a little bit.\n\"…thank…you…\"\n\"Your welcome.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nFrom that day on, Barney began to look after Monica in any way he could.\nMonica was a real klutz, falling down in the middle of nowhere, getting her hair all shaggy, losing her personal belongings all the time, she simply couldn't take care of herself.\nAcademically, she was as good as Barney at magic formulas and anything involving numbers, but her grades in general education were abysmal. Especially in history and languages, it was devastating.\nI guess it can't be helped, so said Barney, opening his notes before giving her explanation, and Monica thanked Barney in a hushed voice in response.\nIn this way, as they studied together every day, Monica's speech gradually became more fluent and her facial expressions became more expressive.\nWhenever she got in trouble, Monica would cry out to Bernie with her eyebrows downcast, and when he fixed her shaggy hair, she would give him a smile like a blooming wildflower.\nHe was the one who had changed Monica. Barney felt some pride in it.\n—Thanks, Barney.\n—Barney, Barney, help meeee!\n—You're incredible, Barney!\nThose little words of Monica's always filled Barney's pride.\n… while the truth, he's got a faintly conscious from it.\nWhen Monica's hair was messy, it was because her classmates had cut it by force. When her personal belongings went missing, it was because they were being hidden. Nevertheless, Barney averted his eyes from this fact and continued to take care of Monica.\nSurely he subconsciously hoped that Monica would isolate herself. Because the more isolated Monica got, the more she relied on him. That way, he could continue to be a dependable honor student.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nWhile Minerva, an institution for training magicians, taught practical spells as a matter of course, the students were forbidden to actually use spells during the first six months of their enrollment.\nA spell was a powerful weapon that could wreak havoc if used in the wrong way. That's why it took at least six months to learn the fundamentals before moving on to practical training.\nBarney has been attending Minerva since he was seven years old, and by the time he was thirteen, he had mastered all of the intermediate spells and was able to use some of the advanced spells as well.\nAbove all, he was the only person in his grade who had mastered shortened chant.\nTherefore, in practical training, he was unbeatable.\nMonica, on the other hand, has only been in school for a short time and has only recently begun to learn the basics.\nBarney was convinced that Monica's understanding of magic formulas was so high that once she learned how to manipulate mana, she would catch up with him in no time.\nHowever, in her first practical class…\n\"How long are\nchuu\ngoing to stand still?\"\n\"…………………..\"\nEven though the teacher urged her to do so, Monica only turned pale and quivered her lips, eventually, the class ended without her even being able to chant, let alone use a spell.\nWhen recess came, Barney closed in on Monica.\n\"What the hell was that? Didn't you get the theory perfectly?\"\n\"B-But, I was too scared…to speak out in front of so many people.\"\nThen Barney finally remembered. Monica was now able to speak more normally in front of him, but she still couldn't talk to other people.\n\"I'm really scared when I speak in front of people… I'm scared that people will look at me the moment I say something… I'm scared of their stares…\"\n\"If you keep saying things like that, you won't be able to use magic no matter how long it takes.\"\n\"…I know.\"\nMonica hung her head down with teary eyes. She must be really frustrated. After all, Barney had seen next to her how diligently she had studied for the past six months.\nI would like to do something about it, he thought, and a good idea came to his mind.\n\"Right, if you're bad at speaking up in front of people, you just have to reduce your chanting.\"\n\"…eh?\"\n\"I'll teach you shortened chant. With it, you could cut the chanting time in half, since it would be easier on you, right?\"\nAt Barney's suggestion, Monica fidgeted, kneading her fingers, letting her gaze wander.\n\"But… Do you think I can do it?\"\n\"I'm sure you can do it. I know how much you've studied the fundamentals, and I'm sure you'll be able to understand the shortened chant in no time.\"\nWhen Barney said this in an unusually passionate tone, Monica's cheeks flushed red in response, and she nodded her head.\n\"I'll do my best… hehehe, you're really can be depended, Barney.\"\n\"Hmph, of course. After all, I am the man who will become the Seven Sages in the future,\" said Barney as he puffed out his chest and Monica smilingly nodded in response.\n\"Yeah, I'm sure you can become one of the Seven Sages. You're an amazing person, after all.\"\nMonica's naive admiration tickled Barney's heart.\nHe thought his path to a bright future was clear. And Barney never doubted that.\n… yet, for now.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nIn the classroom of the practical class, a gasp filled the air. Everyone was speechless, watching the scene in front of them as if they were glued to it. This was an unprecedented feat that no one in this room had ever seen before—no chant spell.\nThis was done by the girl who had failed the practical test the most… Monica Everett.\nWhat is this… I didn't know any of this…\nMonica raised one hand lightly, and a small whirlwind erupted, spiraling around and around. Throughout all of this, Monica's mouth remained shut.\nI never taught her any of this!\nBarney was stunned. The only thing he had taught Monica was how to shorten the chant. When they were alone, Monica was able to use shortened chant, and he assumed she would demonstrate it in this class.\nIf she demonstrated the shortened chant, the people around her would surely look at her differently. If she did, Barney was going to proudly say that he was the one who taught Monica.\nBut the scene that was happening in front of his eyes was more than just a shortened chant.\nThis time, when Monica lifted her other arm, an arrow of ice was created. Again, without chant. She could also use other spells without chanting, even if it wasn't her favored attribute, wind.\nShe had enrolled in Minerva six months ago. And it had only been two weeks since she started her practical class.\nMonica Everett was a true genius, in a realm that could not be reached through hard work alone. That fact was drowning Barney with despair.\nWhile Monica looked at him with admiration, Barney felt deep anger and jealousy.\nIf Barney hadn't been there, she wouldn't have been able to have a proper conversation!\nIf Barney hadn't been there, she'd be all alone in class!\nIf Barney hadn't been there, she'd hardly be able to do anything!\nFeeling terribly betrayed, Barney gritted his teeth with his eyes staggered with jealousy behind the glasses.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nFrom the moment Monica demonstrated her no-chant spell, the environment around her changed drastically. She was treated as a scholarship student and became a pupil of Professor Gideon Rutherford, one of Minerva's most distinguished professors.\nIt was well known that most people who had studied under Professor Rutherford had been chosen as the Seven Sages. Rumored that Monica would eventually become one of them.\nMonica was now under the direct supervision of Professor Rutherford and rarely showed up for regular classes. This naturally meant that she had fewer opportunities to see Barney.\nSince the day Monica used her no chant spell, Barney has not spoken to Monica even once. On several occasions, Monica had tried to talk to him, but Barney had ignored them all.\nBarney's idea of a perfect future started to go haywire little by little from that time on.\nTo shorten the distance between him and Monica, Barney trained tirelessly, but as a result, he suffered from mana poisoning and ended up in the infirmary. Struggling as the mana consumed his body, Barney felt so much hatred toward Monica.\nThe reason why he was suffering so much was all because of Monica. Because of Monica, he has become this crazy. It's all Monica's fault.\n—Monica had ruined Barney's life!\n＊ ＊ ＊\nIn the winter of her fifteenth year, Monica was chosen as one of the Seven Sages.\nThe fact that the youngest of the Seven Sages had been chosen from Minerva's students caused much excitement in the academy.\nEspecially on the day of the inauguration of the Seven Sages and its parade, the whole academy was in an uproar. But all the cheering and praise for Monica was just irritating noises to Barney.\nHe believed that even Barney, his brother's spare, would be recognized by the people around him if he mastered magic and became the Seven Sages. Barney never doubted that he could become one. But the person chosen as one of the Seven Sages was not Barney, but Monica. He was not even invited to the selection process.\n\"Barney!\"\nA voice called out to him when he was leaving Minerva's library. The person who was running up to him was Monica.\nNow that she was one of the Seven Sages, she can no longer be called a student of this school. She was wearing an indigo robe that only the Seven Sages were allowed to wear. The beautiful staff in her hand was also something that only the Seven Sages were allowed to hold.\nMonica hugged her staff to her chest and fidgeted with her fingers. Her childish gestures, her body that was too thin for her age, and her young face were no different from the Monica that Barney knew.\nBut she was no longer Barney's friend. The [Mute Everett] had become the [Silent Witch] of the Seven Sages.\n\"Um, f-for a long time… I really want to thank you, Barney…\"\nMonica was stammering, trying her best to speak.\nBut Barney coldly interrupted her.\n\"Are you mocking me?\"\n\"…huh?\"\nMonica's expression froze.\nOh, what a wonderful feeling is this. thought him as he wanted to distort that face even more.\n\"You want to thank me? Haha, is that sarcasm? You must have been looking down on me, right?\"\n\"Huh? W-Why would I? No, I would never… I just thought that you were an important friend of mine…\"\n\"You're not my friend.\"\nMonica's eyes were wide open, and tears were slowly welling up in them.\nFeels hurt more, he thought.\nMonica should have gone to pieces, so shredded and tattered that she would never be able to recover again.\n\"You must be a detestable person to come all the way to see me in the formal attire of the Seven Sages. Does it make you feel good to make fun of me and look down on me like that? Hey, tell me, Miss Seven Sage?\"\nA teardrop falls from Monica's eye.\nMonica's nose turned red before she cried like a child.\nThat miserable crying face, that crying voice, filled the hole inside Barney's heart just a little bit.\n\"What a shameful way to behave for one of the Seven Sages. Though, I don't consider you to be one of them. You'd be better off holed up in an isolated mountain cabin.\"\nMonica was slumped there, sobbing.\nBarney walked past her quickly, heading for his room.\nThe pitiful cries that reached his ears made him feel better, if only slightly.\nAfter that incident, Barney never heard any more about the activities of the Silent Witch. Rumor has it that the Silent Witch lives a hermit-like life in a mountain cabin. Probably would never see Barney again.\n… this is for the better.\nThus, Barney Jones finally regained his peace of mind.",

      "content": "During the class period, Lana Colette kept glancing sideways at Monica who has been feeling down lately.\nThe reason must have been Casey's sudden withdrawal from school. Lana only heard about it from others, but she heard it was because of family reasons.\nThose who drop out of school due to family reasons were not uncommon in this academy.\nBut for Monica, who has few friends, Casey's withdrawal must have come as a terrible shock. For the past few days, she has always been sad and downcast, even when talking to Lana, she has been strangely awkward.\nEven at lunch, while Lana was lashing out at Claudia, Monica was kind of in a daze.\nLooking back, it was Casey's presence at the lunch table that kept the place alive. Whenever Lana and Claudia got into an argument, Casey would moderately admonish them, and when Monica was silent, Casey would casually bring up the topic.\nEven Lana felt a little sad at Casey's withdrawal. Though the iron-faced Claudia probably didn't feel the same way.\nEventually, when class was over, Lana approached Monica's desk.\nMonica was the type of person whose ups and downs were directly reflected in the way she dressed and styled her hair. As expected, she forgot to button her sleeves, and some strands were sticking out of her braided hair in a silly manner.\nLana approached Monica from behind and pressed on her sticking-out hair with her fingers.\n\"You forgot to button your sleeves.\"\n\"Huh? Ah, you're right…\"\nMonica hadn't realized this until she was approached by Lana.\nWhile Monica was fumbling to re-button her sleeves, Lana held her hair that was sticking out and pinned it up in place. This should make her look a little better.\n\"We're going to have an elective class now. Hey, what class did you end up choosing, Monica?\"\n\"Um… my first choice is chess, and my second choice is law class.\"\n\"The chess class will start at today first period. Since we are going in the same direction, let's walk there together.\"\n\"Y-Yeah.\"\nNodding her head, Monica packed away her writing materials and stood up.\nLana secretly pondered as she walked side by side with Monica.\nShe had no idea what kind of topic to bring up at a time like this. She tried to come up with a variety of topics, but all that came to mind was the latest fad. And Lana could tell that Monica was not interested in such things.\n\"S-Speaking of which, Monica, have you decided on the dress to wear for the ball after the school festival?\"\n\"……………..\"\nMonica stood blankly with her mouth agape and eyes rounded before turning her eyes toward Lana.\nLana was expecting a response like \"I haven't prepared anything yet,\" but judging from Monica's expression, perhaps…\n\"Monica? You are aware that we will be having a ball on the night of the school festival, right?\"\n\"Yeah, I had read that on the schedule…but I assumed we were going to participate in uniform…\"\nLana remembered now that Monica was a transfer student.\nIn Serendia Academy, students basically wore uniforms during ceremonies, but for the balls held afterward, students naturally wore their own formal wear. Especially the ball held after the school festival and graduation ceremony was a grand affair. All the students dressed up to the nines.\n\"…can't I attend in uniform?\"\n\"That's not a good idea, even for a student council member…\"\n\"Ugh…\"\nStudent council members were in charge of the venue of the ball. There was no way they could be absent, and if they attended the ball in their uniforms, it would only embarrass them.\n\"…Monica, do you have a dress?\"\nMonica shook her head mutely.\nAs expected, thought Lana as she put her hand to her forehead.\nThe school festival was just two weeks away. She didn't think that Monica could prepare the dress by herself.\n\"I'll lend you my old one if you like. It's already out of fashion in color and design, though.\"\n\"Eh, but…\"\nMonica mumbled as she kneaded her fingers and cast her head down.\nLana pursed her lips into a pout.\n\"What, you don't like my secondhand stuff?\"\n\"I-I don't mean it like that… I just…\"\nMonica's voice was kind of shaky like she was about to cry. Her unreliable eyebrows furrowed, and a film of tears slowly formed in her round eyes.\n\"I've always received so much help from you…and I haven't been able to give anything back…\"\nMonica's head was turning lower and lower.\nEventually, all Lana could see was Monica's crown… so she pushed it with her fingers.\n\"I'm not expecting anything in return.\"\n\"…even so…\"\n\"I-I mean, you don't need a reason to be nice to your friends, right?\"\nPulling her fingers back from the crown of her head, she saw Monica's head slowly lifts.\nMonica still looked bewildered.\n\"…thank you, Lana.\"\nMonica thanked her in a faint voice. The tears that should have receded a little, for some reason, filled up again along with a strong sense of guilt on her face.\nCan she honestly rely on Lana without any remorse?\nLana folded her arms pouted and glared lightly at Monica.\n\"The dress needs to be adjusted a bit, so come to my room at another time. Anyway, Monica, do you wear a corset?\"\n\"I've never worn any…\"\n\"What!?\"\nLana always wore a light corset under her uniform, even now. For a girl in her late teens, this should be a matter of course…but when Lana took a closer look at Monica's figure, she was convinced.\nHer small figure, which could easily be said to be in her early teens, was too thin rather than slender.\n\"…W-Well, you certainly don't have any fat to tie up…\"\n\"…………\"\nStill, if she tightened her waist more and stuffed her breasts, she would look a little more feminine.\nSo Lana secretly vowed to herself to wear the corset she had used in her early teens.",

      "content": "Corey Lipson was a third-year student at Serendia Academy.\nAs the third son of a baronial family without any special skills, he chose the chess class as his elective course. He had been playing chess with his older brothers since he was a child, so he thought he could play at least as well as anyone else.\nHowever, the level of chess class at Serendia Academy was far higher than Corey had expected.\nIn that class, students were divided into three groups according to their skills: upper, middle, and lower. Basically, students in the same group play against each other, and their rank would change depending on the winning percentage.\nThose who had won prizes in the past or had already taken chess classes in the previous year would be started in the upper or middle group, but Corey was grouped in the lower group. Moreover, he was at the bottom of the lower group.\nSuch third-year students at the bottom of the class were naturally forced into the role of taking care of the first and second-year students.\n\"Okay, the first- and second-year students can start pairing up randomly with each other.\"\nAfter Corey gave a few cursory instructions, the juniors paired up with those closest to them and began to play the game.\nHowever, there was one girl who was standing there dazedly with no one to pair up with. She was a petite girl with light brown hair. Her figure was so small that one might think she was a student from middle school, but judging from her sleeve ornaments, she was a second-year student in high school.\n\"You're not getting a partner, huh. I guess you could pair up with me.\"\n\"O-O-Okay… p-please take care of me…\"\nThe girl bowed her head and took a seat across from Corey. It was rare to see a female student in a chess class, after all.\nNot many girls took chess classes since they tended to be weaker than boys. In the first place, chess was primarily played by men.\nLucky, so Corey secretly giggled.\nStudents will keep track of their wins and losses in this class, and if their winning percentage was high enough, they could move to the higher group.\nLet's get a quick win against this girl, raise my winning percentage, calculated Corey as he laid out his chess pieces.\n\"How long have you been playing chess? Have you participated in any tournaments?\"\n\"I've only got started recently… I read the manual and learned the rules, yesterday.\"\nAhhhh, there they are. Some people think they can play chess just by reading a manual.\nHe was referring to himself, of course.\n\"Since this game will be recorded, I won't give you a handicap, is that okay?\"\n\"I-I'm fine with it.\"\nThe girl nodded and stared at the board.\nI think this will be a piece of cake, laughed Corey without showing it.\n\"…It's checkmate.\"\nThe girl declared as she moved her black knight.\nCorey stared down at the board, breaking out into a cold sweat.\n…wait, wait wait, wait.\nTurning away from the board for a moment, he rubbed his eyes.\nThen, he looked at the board again…\n…wait, wait, wait, what is this, what is this…\nPondered Corey, before long, he covered his face with his hands and hung his head.\nTo give an honest impression of this game, there was only one thing to say: ‘Before I knew it, I had lost.'\nWith frightening speed and precision, the girl overwhelmed Corey. He knew how mercilessly strong she was. It was the same as when he played chess with a person from the higher group… if not better.\n\"… I lost.\"\nWhen Corey surrendered, the girl let out a relieved breath and patted her chest.\nThen, all of a sudden, Corey's shoulders became very heavy. It wasn't that he was slumped over in his defeat. There was an arm on his shoulder and someone was leaning on him.\nWhen Corey twisted his head around, he saw Elliot Howard, his classmate, leaning over his shoulder, peering at the board.\nIf this was just a classmate, he would have just brushed it off and said, ‘What are you doing?' But Elliot Howard was a privileged classmate and a member of the student council. He's too different from him, who was the third son of a mediocre baronial family.\nElliot looked at the board for a moment, leaned over, then tapped Corey on the shoulder.\n\"Do you mind switch a place with me?\"\n\"S-Sure.\"\nAs Corey quickly offered up his seat, Elliot took his place, sitting firmly in his chair.\nThe girl sitting across from him jerked her shoulders. Elliot gave such a girl his usual frivolous smile and said.\n\"Hey, Miss Norton. How about you play with me this time?\"\n\"B-But, we're from different groups…\"\n\"No problem. Even if we're from different groups we can still play a match.\"\nIndeed, Elliot was right, no rule said the upper group and the lower group could not compete against each other. However, in this case, even if the upper group wins, it would not be counted. On the other hand, if the lower group wins, it will significantly affect their winning records.\nSo, people in the upper group have nothing to gain by playing games with lower groups. To put it bluntly, it was just a waste of time. And no one had ever done it.\nAnd yet, Elliot volunteered to compete with a junior member of the lower group.\nElliot was among the three best players in the upper group. It was said that his selection for the national chess tournament was virtually guaranteed.\nI mean, the chess tournament is just around the corner. How can he be thinking of playing against a junior member of a lower group at such a time?\nSkeptical, Corey left his seat to find his next opponent.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nElliot picked up one of the black and white pieces, quickly reshuffled it under the desk, and held his fist out in front of Monica.\n\"Choose whichever you like.\"\n\"I…I'll take this one, then.\"\nMonica opened the hand she was pointing at, and what came out was a black king.\nElliot went first in white, and Monica went after him in black.\nAs Monica was arranging the black pieces, Elliot, who had quickly finished arranging them, muttered, \"Say,\" resting his chin on his hand.\nHer arranging hands stopped and looked at Elliot.\n\"I-Is there something wrong?\"\n\"The other day's game.\"\nElliot poked at the piece with his fingertips and spoke as if he were talking to himself.\n\"You knew I hadn't taught you the castling yet, and you also knew I won the game with it… so, why didn't you point it out in front of everyone?\"\nMonica blinked in surprise.\nThe other day's game—her first game of chess—she still remembered it well.\nThe game where Elliot's side has no queen and the first move was given to Monica.\nMonica had the upper hand in the beginning, but at the last minute, Elliot used a special move called ‘castling' to move Rook and King, resulting in Monica's defeat.\nAt that time, Monica didn't know the special move of castling, so it was natural for her to be defeated.\nAs Monica was at a loss for an answer, Elliot continued with more words.\n\"You had every right to blame me. You can even say to me that it's not a fair game.\"\nSuddenly, Monica remembered.\nFor the past few days, Elliot had been acting strange, as if he wanted to say something to Monica in the student council room but only to slink away quickly. Could it have been because he wanted to mention this?\n\"Um, well…\"\nMonica carefully chose her words as she answered.\n\"… if it was someone I know, I'm sure he would have said this to me…\n‘You are foolish if you have taken a seat at the table only relying on the explanations of others without looking up the official rules for yourself.'\"\nNeedless to say whom that acquaintance she was referring to.\nAs Monica giggled, remembering Louis Miller's broad smile, Elliot looked at Monica with half-open eyes.\n\"Hey, that friend of yours, isn't he too much of a jerk?\"\n\"Well, but I really think he's got a point… he even said,\n‘The game has begun before you even sit down at the table.'\n\"\nElliot let out a deep sigh and held up his hands in resignation.\n\"Come on, give me a break. It's not like I wanted to set you up so I didn't teach you castling. I knew there was no way a novice could understand castling, so I had underestimated your ability and tried to win without it, honestly.\"\nMonica gave a vague \"Huh,\" and Elliot ruffled his bangs as if he was upset.\n\"That's the part you should be angry about. I had underestimated you, got pissed off, and forced myself to win by using a castling move I didn't teach you. That was not fair. It was shameful and unbecoming of a noble.\"\n\"Um…\"\nMonica was at a loss. She had no idea what part of Elliot's words she should be angry about.\nMonica has never been angry when she was belittled. If anything, she felt more troubled when people pointed it out. She didn't see any reason to blame Elliot for not teaching her how to castling, especially if it wasn't intentional. It was her fault for not looking up the rules herself.\n\"…I'm sorry. I can't think of any reason to be angry.\"\nWhen she uttered those words, Elliot's mouth gaped open in surprise for some reason.\nAnd that baffled words continued, as she wondering if she had said something so strange.\n\"As long as I can play chess, I'm fine with it.\"\nMonica placed the remaining pieces on the board and faced Elliot.\n\"I'm looking forward to having a nice game.\"\nAll expression disappeared from Monica's face.\nHer young face showed no sign of fear, and her quiet, calm eyes awaited Elliot's first move.\nElliot exhaled slowly and put his hand on the white pawn.\n\"Then, I won't hold back anything.\"\n\"…That will make things better.\"\n\"Huh? Was that guy not enough for you?\"\n\"…it was more fun playing chess with you, Lord Howard.\"\n\"I'm so honored to hear that.\"\nFor some reason, Elliot was grinning happily, showing his white teeth.",

      "content": "——This is a story about Elliot Howard, the eldest son of Count Dursvy when he was only six years old.\nIt was when Elliot's father took him to visit the Duke of Crockford's household, and there, he met ******.\n****** was about the same age as Elliot, but he was physically weak and had left the castle to recuperate at his grandfather's house. For that reason, Elliot was brought to the house to be his playmate.\nBut the sight of ****** made Elliot uncomfortable.\nJust like his small body, his mind was timid. His swordsmanship and horsemanship were terrible as well. Sucked at ballroom dancing, had a poor memory, and was bad at studies. No matter what he did, all of them would end up bad.\nIn addition, he could not speak well in front of others and would bite his tongue easily.\nIn fact, his servant was much more dignified in his behavior and speech than him.\nHow hard it is to be the master of such a useless little fellow, Elliot thought, even secretly feeling pity for his servant.\nMore than anything, Elliot was annoyed at the thought that the incompetent ****** might eventually rule over them.\nSo, at that time, Elliot ridiculed and mocked ****** in the typical six-year-old boy way of being mean.\nEach time he did, ****** would hang his head down sadly and said.\n\"…I'm sorry I couldn't do it properly…\"\nHow miserable he was. For someone who held a much, much higher position than Elliot.\nSooner or later, he would have to lead people.\nBut, despite having less ability than others, there was one thing that he knew a lot about. That was astronomy.\nThough astronomy would be useless in the future, ******'s eyes would sparkle when he talked about the stars and read astronomy books in his spare time.\nSo, Elliot secretly hid ******'s cherished astronomy book in a tree behind the eyes of adults and followers.\nSure enough, ****** broke into half a cry and clung to Elliot, begging him to give his book back.\n\"Look, it's up in that tree over there. They aren't that tall, so it should be easy for you to get them, right?\"\n****** grew pale as he looked up at the tree. The boy, with his poor physical skills, could not possibly climb the tree on his own.\nKnowing this, Elliot grinned and egged the boy on.\n\"Are you going to cry to your servant again, like you always do? Or do you want to ask an adult for help and said you can't do it by yourself?\"\n\"……………..\"\n******* stood looking up at the tree intensely but eventually bit his lip tightly before starting to climb the tree.\nHowever, his limbs were not moving properly. After just a little bit of climbing, ****** began to quiver and become motionless.\n\"What a wimp.\"\nWhen Elliot muttered those words, ******'s trembling hand reached out for a branch… but he failed to grasp it, and ended up falling down.\nElliot remained silent and watched that scene because it wasn't much of a height, but he noticed something strange when the ****** fell to the ground.\nFearfully approaching, he saw a sharp branch stuck in the side of ******. The branch that had dropped on the spot where he had fallen had stabbed him, and a red stain was slowly spreading around the spot where the branch had pierced ******'s side.\nElliot screamed as he turned pale and called out the grown-ups.\n\"Do you realize what you've done?\"\nAfter saying that, his father punched Elliot in the cheek. Elliot made no excuses. He knew the whole accident was caused by his own thoughtless act.\nThe injuries on ****** were not very deep and not life-threatening. However, it was still an injury that required several stitches.\n\"You have given him a scar that will last a lifetime. No amount of your life can atone for that crime.\"\nHaving said that, his father was ready to give up his own head.\nBut then ******, who had just received medical attention, barged in.\n\"Please wait!\"\nSupported by his servant, ****** stood on his own feet.\nNaturally, since he had just finished his suturing surgery a while ago, his complexion was pale, and he was sweating profusely.\n\"Elliot was not at fault, it was me who messed around and climbed the tree. Elliot was even trying to stop me, and risked his life to protect me.\"\nBullshit. At the moment ****** fell, Elliot was watching that scene with a smirk on his face. He thought for sure that fall would not injure him.\nEven then, ****** had covered Elliot, allowing him to get away scot-free and made his father managed to keep his head as well.\nLater on, Elliot barged into ******'s room and asked.\n\"Why did you cover me? That accident was my fault, wasn't it? it even made you injured badly because of me.\"\nWhile Elliot wondered doubtfully if he was trying to curry favor with him, ****** gave a bitter face and said.\n\"… The reason I fell out of the tree was that I wasn't good enough at climbing trees. Therefore, it was my fault and I couldn't think of any reason to blame you.\"\nHis tone sounded almost as if he took it for granted.\nHis face seriously implied that it was his fault for not being able to climb the tree properly.\n\"…then, once that injury is healed, I'll teach you how to climb a tree.\"\nAs soon as Elliot mentioned that in a whisper, ******'s light blue eyes sparkled.\n\"Really? I'm so happy. I've been thinking for a while how much better the stars would look from up in the trees.\"\nThe smiling face of ****** who said that showed how truly happy he was from the bottom of his heart.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThe words of Monica Norton, which overlapped with the words of that boy, abruptly brought back memories of the past.\nWhen Elliot asked her why she was not blaming him, Monica said.\n—I'm sorry. I can't think of any reason to be angry.\nWhy did she not tell him that it was his fault for not explaining the rules?\nJust like the boy at that time who said that with the same face.\nAh, now I understand. I guess that's probably why I've always been drawn to Miss Norton.\nWhile thinking about this in the corner of his mind, Elliot moved the white bishop.\nAnd Monica played her next move without pause.\nSame as before, Monica played her pieces unusually fast since Monica rarely took a long time to think. When Elliot moved a piece, she immediately made the next move.\nEventually, when Monica moved the black queen, the game was over.\nElliot stared at the board then opened his mouth.\n\"…Stalemate, huh.\"\nElliot didn't give her a handicap this time, in fact, he got the first one to move, but against a girl who had only played chess a few times before the game ended up in a draw.\nAnd now, that girl was staring at the board without any expression of regret or happiness on her face. She was probably analyzing the game she had just played.\n\"You know, playing chess can show one's personality.\"\n\"… Eh?\"\nAt Elliot's murmur, Monica blinked at him.\nElliot scrutinized his droopy eyes in response and shrugged lightly.\n\"You see, in Cyril's case. his chess style is very simple: protect the king. He's what we call a hard defensive type. But you are the opposite.\"\nStrictly speaking, Monica's chess style was somewhat different from aggressive.\nTo put it simply, it was thorough, logical, and efficient.\n\"Maybe you would even use the King as bait to win.\"\nTo Monica Norton, King's pieces and Pawn's pieces have equal value.\nFor this reason, she can sacrifice any piece without hesitation if it will increase her chances of winning, even a little.\n—That's exactly why her methods were so merciless and cruelly strong.\nWhile the current game ended in a draw, Monica had only played three chess matches under her belt and this was her third time.\nShould Monica gain further experience and learn to play the game… she would become a fearsome monster.\nSuch a premonition sent a shiver down Elliot's spine.\nDespite her overwhelming talent that even Felix can't measure, she has a shy and demeaning personality—that imbalance was simply too unsettling.\nHe was observing Monica closely when she opened her small mouth.\n\"…As for your chess, Lord Howard.\"\n\"Oh? An amateur tries to talk about my chess?\"\n\"…you seemed to be fixated on the rank of the pawn.\"\nElliot's eyebrows arched in a twitch.\nWhat Monica pointed out was something that had been said to him before by his teacher.\nElliot's style of chess was overly fixated on the rank of the pieces.\nThe queen should be played like a queen, and the pawn should be played like a pawn… in a formation where the higher ranking pieces should be put to use.\nIn a sense, it could be called chess as opposed to Monica, who did not find any difference in its value as a piece.\nPointing at Elliot's lined pawn, Monica said.\n\"In this game, there were moments when your pawn could be promoted (*a pawn that reaches the far end of the enemy line can become a queen or other piece). But you did not opt for promotion, which was the best move at that time.\"\nElliot secretly marveled at how she had noticed.\nIndeed, Elliot always tried his best to avoid a promotion move.\n\"…I don't like the rule of promotion.\"\nElliot pinched one of White's pawns and placed it back in his own board.\nSoldiers who can reach the farthest end of the enemy lines can get promoted… That rule was something Elliot hated to death.\n\"I had an uncle who fell in love with a commoner and made her his wife. He said she was a pure and kind-hearted woman. However, she ended up embezzling my uncle's money. Felt betrayed, my uncle… hanged himself off.\"\nThe person who first found his uncle hanging from the ceiling, swaying, was Elliot, who had come to learn chess from him.\nAlmost all the money was gone from his uncle's house. When the wife, a former commoner, heard of his uncle's death, she seized all the money and ran away—without mourning the man who had driven her husband to suicide.\n\"Do you get it now? A commoner should act like a commoner, and a noble should act like a noble. If you overstep the bounds of your status, there will always be someone who would be suffering misfortunes.\"\nThat's why Elliot detested commoners who didn't know their place in society. When he saw someone risen to a high position, he felt repulsed.\nAt first, Elliot felt the same way about Monica.\nDespite being a commoner, Monica Norton enrolled in Serendia Academy and became a member of the student council. And such Monica was an eyesore for Elliot… up until now.\n…I guess sometimes there are some people…who have an overwhelming talent that transcends the boundaries of their status.\nThe question of where to place such a person remained unanswered for Elliot.\nSo, with a bitter look on his face, he decided to give her a word of advice.\n\"…Miss Norton, I will hold off for the time being on what your evaluation is and where your standing is.\"\n\"O-Okay…\"\n\"But I have a word of advice. A commoner born with exceptional talent is often envied by the incompetent or taken advantage of by the cunning. I know one person who had his life ruined that way.\"\nElliot's words made Monica's face grow pale and tense.\n\"You have to be careful how you conduct yourself. I'm sure you're going to be in the spotlight a lot from now on.\"\n\"…eh?\"\nElliot wordlessly gestured at the blackboard to a puzzled Monica.\nProf. Boyd was writing something on it.\n[Chess Tournament, Selected Participants]\nFront Player: Monica Norton\nMiddle Player: Benjamin Moulding\nCaptain: Elliot Howard\nMonica's face went white right down to her lips.\n\"Che… Che-Chess Tournament!?\"\n\"On the last day off, four days before the school festival, we're going to invite representatives from other schools to join us for a chess tournament. I assume you see those events in the budget proposal.\"\n\"B-B-B-B-B-But… W-Why me!?\"\nAs Monica's eyes widened to their limit, shaking uncontrollably, Prof. Boyd strode up to Monica's side.\nHe—a big skinhead with the dignity of having been through many battles—tapped Monica on the shoulder with a hand so big that it could have easily crushed her face.\nThen, in a low voice with no expression, he left a few words.\n\"I'm counting on you.\"\n\"I ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca…\"\nProbably wanting to say, \"I can't,\" Elliot shrugged his shoulders and told Monica.\n\"Well, just take it easy, Miss Norton.\"\nMonica was still convulsing while repeating the same words, ‘I ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca'. Her consciousness must have been gone by half.",

      "content": "After school, Felix was busy working in the student council room, while Elliot and Monica were heading there almost at the same time. It seemed that they had been selected to be part of the chess tournament, and had a brief conversation with Prof. Boyd about it.\nEverybody but Felix had just left the student council room.\nWith the school festival coming up, they were busy dealing with outside parties and meeting with the heads of the various departments. On the other hand, Felix had a little more time on his hands since he was just waiting for the report.\nJust then, he heard some good news: Elliot and Monica had been selected to be part of the chess tournament.\nFelix smiled at them.\n\"Glad to hear that two of our student council members have been chosen again this year. Good luck in representing the school. I'll reduce your workload a bit until the upcoming chess tournament is over.\"\n\"Tha… Thank, you…\"\nWith the school festival just around the corner, the student council members were naturally very busy, but Monica always finished her work quickly, and Bridget, who shared Elliot's position as secretary, will be able to cover for him.\nBridget, the secretary, although talented in her own right, proved to be quite adept at working with people. Her ability to keep the department heads, committees and club representatives on track was almost endearing.\nRight now, the busiest person was definitely Neil, the general affairs manager. Felix has been following up on Neil's work, but it might be better to have Cyril help him as well. Up until now, Cyril had been assigned as Monica's trainer, but once the chess tournament is over, it should be no problem to remove Cyril from that role.\nFelix glanced at Monica and Elliot as he contemplated the work arrangements.\nMonica remained as usual, awkwardly downcast, fidgeting and kneading her fingers. However, the mood of Elliot standing next to her seemed to be much less spiky.\nElliot was not pleased with the idea of Monica, a commoner, becoming a member of the student council, but his attitude has softened a bit recently.\n…Cyril's attitude has changed recently, and now Elliot too, has something happened between them and the little squirrel that I'm not aware of?\nIn Elliot's case, it was probably about the chess class. Felix originally wanted to recommend a practical magic class to Monica, but she chose to take a chess class. If only he had been a year behind, he would have been able to play chess with her, he thought, secretly disappointed. After all, he had taken a chess class last year.\n\"How strong is the little squirrel from your point of view, Elliot?\"\n\"Pretty impressive. Despite only having played three times as a beginner, I was dragged into a stalemate.\"\n\"Oh?\"\nElliot was strong enough to be chosen as the captain of the team. It would be worthy of praise if she could get a draw against him\nFelix suddenly thought of something, took out a chessboard and a set of pieces from the cabinet, and then turned his head at Monica.\n\"How about playing a match with me? It never hurts to play against a variety of opponents when competing in chess tournaments.\"\n\"I-I-I-I-I-I-I wouldn't dare… I-I… don't want to interfere, with your work, Your Highness.\"\n\"I have some free time right now. Right… if you beat me, I will listen to one of your requests, anything.\"\nMonica's round eyes widened at Felix's proposal. Her normally dark and shadowy brown eyes reflected the light diffusely, glittering with the color of young leaves.\n\"A-Anything?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nNodding, Felix secretly felt a surge of excitement in his heart.\nUsually, Monica would never ask for anything from anyone. She was the kind of girl who would squirm apologetically even just to borrow a quill.\nNow such a Monica will ask a favor from him!\nWhat exactly will this little squirrel be asking Felix for?\n…maybe a mathematical book?\nIt could very well be, but if it really was, so be it. After all, how could you not want to reward a cute little animal when it's begging for something?\nFelix recalled the scene where Monica was drinking chocolate with Cyril not long ago.\nLately, his favorite little squirrel seemed to be quite attached to Cyril. Before he knew it, the way she called him had changed from \"Lord Ashley\" to \"Lord Cyril\". But she still addressed Felix as \"Your Highness\"!\nAll in all, he was sulking over the fact that his favorite pet was fond of someone other than him.\nWell, if all she wants is a mathematical book, so be it.\nIt might be fun to surprise the little squirrel by presenting her with an extremely rare book. With this idea in mind, Felix arranged his pieces.\nNow, he had to lose cleverly without Elliot and Monica noticing.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"It's checkmate.\"\nFelix secretly smiled at the board as he listened to Monica's declaration.\n…hmmm…\nHe did cut a few corners, but Monica won the game outright. Perhaps there was no reason to cut corners in this match.\nI was planning on making it a little more of a close game, but…oh well. It was going to be a losing game anyway.\nWhile Felix was thinking about this, Elliot, who had been watching this one-sided and overwhelming game, glared at Monica with twitching cheeks.\n\"…I just realized, Miss Norton… you went easy on me during our match at lunch, didn't you?\"\nAt Elliot's words, Monica was taken aback and shook her head.\n\"N-N-N-N-No, I don't, I…never went easy on you!\"\nMonica desperately denied Elliot's claims, then…\n\"I did all I could to make it a stalemate!\"\nShe blew herself up.\n\"I knew it, you were aiming for a draw from the start, and did you know what that is? They call that hold-ing-back!\"\nElliot grunted in a low voice and pinched Monica's right cheek. The soft cheek of Monica stretched further than he expected.\nWith a pinch on her cheek, Monica gave a gagging, sobbing excuse.\n\"I only wanted to test a pattern for becoming a stalemateeeeeee…\"\n\"So you used me as a test subject. Now I'm pissed. I'm going to tell Prof. Boyd to swap out the captain for the front player.\"\n\"Noooooh! I'm sowwyyyyyy!\"\nThe scene of Elliot pinching Monica's cheeks as she whimpered bitterly gave Felix the familiar look of that brat.\nAlthough Elliot was now obsessed with maintaining the integrity of nobility, Felix knew that he used to be quite a rascal.\nThey're so lively, really.\nFelix laughed as he looked at Elliot, who looked strangely happy despite his anger.\n\"Secretary Howard, please spare her at that. You'll stretch the little squirrel's cheek pouch out.\"\nMonica rubbed her reddened cheeks as she sniffled when Elliot pulled his hand away from her cheek with a look of dejection on his face.\n\"So, what does the little squirrel want to ask me for?\"\n\"I…can ask anything… can't I?\"\n\"Of course.\"\nMonica clenched her fists tensely as Felix nodded approvingly.\n\"I wish…you'd stop…calling me \"little squirrel.\"\n\"…………\"\nFelix silently reached out with a smiling, gentle smile and pinched Monica's left cheek, which was still white.\n\"Whyyyyy!?\"\n\"Wow, it stretches really well. Yeah, this is going to be a bit of a habit.\"\n\"ihh huurhhs.\" (It hurts)\n\"Oh, I apologize,\nMonica\n.\"\nWhen Felix quickly pulled his hand away, Monica stroked her cheeks on both sides, sobbing miserably… then opening her eyes to the limit, and looked at Felix.\n\"Just now… you called me…\"\n\"Mm. What's the matter, Monica?\"\nMonica's cheeks were red and swollen, but she managed to turn them back to normal when Felix smiled at her.\n\"At…at least, like everyone else, I mean, like, Miss Norton, or Treasurer Norton…\"\n\"I assume your request is to stop calling me \"little squirrel\"? But I don't recall it stating anything about how I call.\"\nMonica finally stopped twitching at Felix's nonchalant reply.\nAt this moment, in Monica's mind, there was [Barrier Magician] with a bad personality laughing, although Felix had no way of knowing.\n——Hahaha, this is what happens when you don't set strict conditions.\nThis was what it meant to win the fight and lose the war, Monica thought as she cried in her heart.",

      "content": "Benjamin Moulding, a third-year high school student who took part as a second player for Serendia Academy in a chess tournament, was the son of a court musician.\nHe has been studying music since childhood, doing everything from playing to composing music, and apparently, he already has fans in the high social circle.\nWith straight, flaxen hair that hung down to his shoulders, Benjamin was a young man with a delicate, ephemeral appearance.\n…Indeed, he was an ephemeral young man.\n\"Chess is like music! The game record is like the musical score! If you look at the game record, if you play one game, you can see the musical aspect in your opponent's chess! Forte! Forte! Sforzando! Sforzando! Some chess games are very aggressive, while others have a solemnity like a classical piece. Elliot's chess is like a marching march! A disciplined military style of Alla Marcha, possessing unconventional beauty and strength! Yes, just listen and you will hear it! The sound of the trumpet announcing the beginning of the war! The noise of horsemen kicking the ground!\"\nMonica seriously wondered when Benjamin was catching his breath, as his face turned red with spittle flying from his mouth.\nElliot, standing beside him, shrugged his shoulders with a weary look on his face.\n\"Well, he's a bit of an artist. Anyway, it's a long story.\"\n\"O-Okay…\"\n\"You might as well just ignore it.\"\nRegardless of whether he heard Elliot's voice or not, Benjamin moved his thin, delicate fingers as if he were waving a conductor's stick, staring at the board with ecstatic eyes.\nThe board represented the end of the game between Monica and Benjamin.\n\"Miss Norton's chess is like a symphony played by an orchestra! Each note from the beginning to the end of the piece is meticulously calculated in the score. The magnificent and majestic melody created by the perfect harmony of all the instruments is the culmination of a musician's soul! It is no exaggeration to say that this is a miraculous score bestowed upon us by the god of music! …in other words, what I'm trying to say is…\"\nFacing Monica, Benjamin patted her on the thin shoulder and said.\n\"You're the captain. Keep up the good work.\"\n\"I think so, too.\"\nIn agreement with Benjamin's words, Elliot concurred easily.\nMonica squealed, cowering with her head in her hands.\n\"N-Nooo, that's too muuuuccch!\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nUntil the day of the chess tournament, the chosen students stayed behind after school and played chess incessantly.\nAt that training session, Monica had her first game with the second-in-line player, Benjamin Moulding.\nBenjamin was chosen as one of the players, which made him a strong opponent. However, Elliot had warned her \"don't go for a stalemate\", so Monica went all out and defeated him.\nResulting, the occurrence of the story mentioned earlier.\n\"Out of all of us, I'm the weakest. So, it only makes sense if I become the first-in-line player!\"\nBenjamin stated, folding his arms as if it was only natural.\nMonica shook her head vigorously.\n\"Th-That…that's not true! I am the most novice here!\"\n\"Novice or not, the strongest one gets to be the captain. I am not telling lies or being modest! After all, our family motto is, ‘You may lie to debt collectors and your lovers, but you can't lie about music and chess!'\"\nThis was not the kind of family motto that could be said proudly. But Elliot just shrugged his shoulders in exasperation. Apparently, he was used to this kind of exchange.\nBenjamin waved his finger in the air as if he didn't see Elliot's exasperation in his eyes.\n\"Listen, Miss Norton. My chess is music without limits. Sometimes intense, sometimes sad. It can be light, it can be heavy, it can be grand, it can be majestic! I can recreate and play any kind of musicality in chess… but that doesn't mean I'm crazy good at chess!\"\nOnly the last word was delivered with a posed look.\n\"…I think…you're strong enough already, so…\"\n\"I'm aware that I'm fairly, moderately, reasonably strong, but not outstandingly strong. However, your strength is genuine. Who could do it if not you?\"\nElliot gave an approving nod, seemingly agreeing with him.\nAt this rate, she will definitely turn herself into a captain!\nSo Monica clung desperately to them and begged.\n\"I am begging you, please… the first-in-line player position is already terrifying enough… but if you make me captain…\"\nA blinding memory of the past came back to Monica's mind.\nAn interview that left her hyperventilating. Enough to make the content of her stomach spill out when rehearsing for a ceremony.\nIf she became a captain, another incident like that might happen all over again.\nElliot held a finger to his chin and squinted his droopy eyes as Monica whimpered mournfully.\n\"Well, I suppose it will be a bit of a hassle to change the order since Prof. Boyd has already submitted our application… I guess we'll just have to go with it… in which case, I will remain as the captain…\"\nElliot played his bangs with a reluctant look.\n\"They're expecting a lot of us this year, you know? Especially since Serendia Academy dominated the last tournament.\"\nElliot's words suddenly reminded Monica of Felix's words.\nGlad to hear that two of our student council members have been chosen again this year.\nThat was what Felix had told Monica and Elliot the other day when they reported to him on becoming players.\n\"Um, did any members…of the student council…participate…in the tournament last year?\"\n\"His Highness and General Affairs Manager Maywood did. By the way, His Highness was the second-in-line player, and General Affairs Manager Maywood was the captain.\"\n\"I see…\"\nMonica's eyes peeled back at Elliot's words.\nUsually, when it comes to this kind of thing, the captain who was third in line was the most powerful. So she just assumed Felix was the one…\nOut of all the student council members, the one who seemed far from being the most \"sharp\" was Neil, the general affairs manager!\n\"Isn't Maywood General Affairs Manager very thoughtful? I mean, he always knows what I was going to do.\"\n\"O-Okay…\"\n\"That's why in chess, you can do the opposite. At the place where you don't want to be attacked, he will attack you without mercy… and that can be pretty nasty.\"\nIt was hard to imagine where gentle-looking Neil completely blocking his opponent's strategy.\nAs Monica tilted her head, remembering Neil's amiable smile, Benjamin interjected, waving his finger as if he were waving a conducting baton.\n\"General Affairs Manager Maywood's chess game seems to be an extremely sophisticated improvisation. The way he reads his opponent's moves and responds perfectly to them is truly amazing!\"\n\"Um… then, what about His Highness's chess?\"\nAsking Benjamin in a hushed voice, Monica recalled her game with Felix the other day.\nMonica had won that game by an overwhelming margin, but Felix didn't seem to be taking it seriously—or rather, Felix's chess was the kind of chess where he hadn't revealed all his hands.\nElliot's chess showed glimpses of his beliefs, but Felix's chess felt like he was hiding them thoroughly.\nThat's why Monica was curious to know how Benjamin felt about Felix's chess.\nIn response to Monica's question, Benjamin rested his chin on his hand and closed his eyes.\n\"It is very difficult to read any trace of musicality from His Highness's chess. But yes, I dare say it may be similar to Miss Norton's chess.\"\n\"………..Eh?\"\nBenjamin's fingers, which he had been moving like a conductor's rod, stopped in a high, raised position in response to Monica rounded her eyes in surprise.\nThen, as if lowering the blade of a guillotine, he swung his fingers straight down.\n\"Neat and precise… a chess style that involves all possible moves to slaughter the king without fail.\"\nAN:\n[The strength of the student council members' chess]\nModerately strong -> Cyril, Bridget\nQuite strong -> Elliot\nAbsurdly strong -> Neil, Monica\n??? -> Felix",

      "content": "\"Monica, how about we go shopping on the next day off?\"\nAt a certain day lunchtime, a week before the upcoming school festival, Lana suggested that idea.\nLana sounded like she has been planning on going shopping to get some things she needed for the school festival.\nIn Serendia Academy, students could go shopping in the nearby town if they filed an out-of-town notification. But as Monica chewed on a piece of bread, she shook her head.\n\"I'm sorry…but I had some things to do…on that day…\"\n\"…chess tournament.\"\nThe piece of bread stuck in Monica's throat when Claudia blurted out the words, caused her to choke. While Lana widened her eyes in response, looked at Monica in shock.\n\"Do the student council have jobs on the day of the chess tournament?\"\n\"No, I just…\"\nClaudia blurted out again, intercepting the stammering Monica.\n\"…She's become representative player, as a first player.\"\nThat words almost caused the same thing to happen again, so Monica turned her head at Claudia with tears in her eyes.\nIt's not surprising that few people were aware of the players representing the chess tournament, as they were discreetly posted on the bulletin board.\nIn fact, the chess tournament itself was not a very large-scale event. Even it was called a tournament, but in reality, it's more like a social event where players from other schools were invited. Because of that, very few students had an interest in the chess tournament.\nEven Lana, who stared at her with her eyes wide open, didn't seem to know that Monica had been chosen as a player in the chess tournament.\n\"What? Don't tell me you've been chosen as a player, Monica?\"\n\"…………m-more or less…\"\nTalking about something like getting chosen as a representative always made Monica uncomfortable, so she never told anyone about this.\n—You're getting too carried away, you're only a good-for-nothing without skills.\nThose memories of heartless words thrown at her in the past kept running through her head. The mere thought of the cold eyes of that boy Monica had once believed to be her friend was enough to make her heart squeezed, but contrary to her expectation…\n\"That's amazing!\"\nLana rattled her chair off, leaned forward to examine the flabbergasted Monica before excitedly rambled on.\n\"Oh, my gosh! Why do you keep those things to yourself! Do cheering the match allowed in there?\"\n\"…you're planning to do that when you don't even know the chess rules?\"\nLana's lower lip pouted at Claudia's remark.\n\"I've learned the name of each piece.\"\n\"…Are you have no shame, to say understand the rules with that alone?\"\n\"W-What's wrong with that?\"\nWhile blushing with embarrassment, Lana looked at Monica whose mouth was opening and closing repeatedly, unsure of what to say, but her fluster state forced her to nod.\n\"Yeah, I'm happy… to have your support,\" said Monica in a hushed voice, leaving Claudia sighed in disbelief.\n\"… honestly, that statement could cause the bystander idiots who don't understand the rules to cheer loudly.\"\n\"Not even I would do something like that!\" yelled Lana with her raised eyebrows, before turning her head to Claudia as if she had remembered something.\n\"Speaking of which, didn't you participate in last year's tournament? I remember there were also two members from the student council…\"\n\"…I'm surprised you remembered.\"\nClaudia grunted as her beautiful face contorted in vexation. Expressing as if she had been confronted with the mistakes of her past.\n\"Right, after Neil said, ‘Let's do our best'… I can't hold back in my match and accidentally playing it with my all… what a blunder…\"\nMiss Claudia Ashley was well-versed in many knowledge, yet extremely troublesome to handle at the same time.\nEssentially, she loathed being depended on by anyone, kept others at a distance with a brooding aura, and made no effort to hide her spiteful attitude to anyone but Neil.\nOf course, her motivation to participate in the tournament last year was the participation of Neil.\nI wonder what kind of chess Lady Claudia plays… I'd like to have a match with her, but I don't think she would agree to my request if I asked her to… probably…\nAccording to Elliot, Serendia Academy had dominated the tournament last year, so Claudia must be very strong. Maybe she should ask Elliot or Benjamin about Claudia's chess.\nAs Monica was engrossed with that thought, something brought to Lana's mind as she suddenly chimed in.\n\"Hey, I was wondering, are the schools we're playing against going to be the same ones this year?\"\n\"… I suppose. It was dubbed as a social event for the three most prestigious schools, after all.\"\n…..Seriously?\nMonica's heart jumped with an unpleasant sound at Claudia's words.\nSpeaking of the three most prestigious schools in this Ridill Kingdom, there was the Serendia Academy, a prestigious school for the children of noble families. The \"Temple\" under the jurisdiction of the shrine excelled in the field of law. And the last one was the best institute for training magicians…\n…Minerva.\nThat thought was resulting in her fork slipped out of her hand. And a clicking noise was reverberated awfully loud, leaving her heart pounded heavily with her palms wet with sweat.\n\"Monica?\"\n\"…ah… I'm sorry…\"\nMonica hurriedly got out of her chair and tried to pick up the fallen fork… but her fingers were unable to hold it properly. The fork slipped off between her fingers and fell to the floor again.\n—Minerva, an institute for training magicians, is an institution where Monica Everett, the Silent Witch, once attended.\nMonica had graduated at the age of fifteen after skipping a grade, and most likely, her classmates from that time were still in attendance at Minerva.\n…I'll be fine, I think they don't even remember me. I'm sure.\nLike Monica always did, she had kept her head down and rarely spoke in public. Even after she had learned the no-chant spell, she mostly stayed in the lab and didn't show up at any conferences or research presentations, so only a few people had memorized Monica's face.\n…I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine.\nHer desperate self-convincing words couldn't stop her body from shaking, flashing out the memories of the scornful eyes of the boy she once believed to be her friend.\n—You're not my friend.\n*gasp* Monica's throat tightened.\nUnsure of how to breathe properly, Monica took a series of short, gasping breaths. It was the first sign of hyperventilation. Monica hurriedly pressed her hand over her mouth.\n\"Monica!?\"\nLana, noticing that something was wrong with Monica, got out of her chair and kneeled down beside her.\nI can't let Lana worried.\nEven when Monica's face grew pale, her body shaking, she moved her trembling lips.\n\"I'm fine… yeah, it's nothing.\"\n\"But your condition didn't look like it's nothing!\" grunted Lana in grimaced, when Claudia blurted out.\n\"… do you know anyone in the Temple or perhaps… Minerva?\"\n\"!\"\n\"… looking at you, you seem to have some kind of bad relationship with that person.\"\nMonica shook her head furiously as she held her chest.\nNo, you're wrong, Barney's not at fault, it must've been my fault, I was wrong, so it's not a bad relationship or anything, it's all my fault.\nEvery time she saw that nostalgic face in her mind, Monica would blame herself. Otherwise, she felt like he would never forgive her. She felt as if she wasn't even allowed to live.\nI'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry I came out of my mountain cabin… I shouldn't have been out in the sunlight… I should have done what Bernie said…\n\"Monica,\" called out Lana in a strong voice as she put her hands on her shoulder. In response, Monica turned her head slowly facing Lana, then with a determined look on her face, Lana told her.\n\"Before going to the chess tournament, get up earlier in the morning and come to my room. You hear me, Monica, You\nmust\ncome.\"\n\"…………\"\n\"Promise me.\"\nMonica has a habit to nod unconsciously when someone asked her in an assertive voice.\nSo in response to her reluctant nod, Lana told her, \"You must come, okay?\" to remind her about her promise.",

      "content": "Ever since Monica heard that Minerva's students were coming to the chess tournament, she has not been able to sleep well. Waking up on the morning of the competition day was just as terrible, and she woke up just as the sun was rising. The cold voice of the boy whom she believed to be her friend was echoing in the back of her ears.\n—You'd be better off holed up in an isolated mountain cabin.\nMonica sniffed softly and pulled the blanket over her head. Then, a thud sound came across from the room. She slightly rolled up the edge of the blanket and peered towards the sound.\n\"Oh, this should be good, right? There, I've done my turn.\"\n\"What a tricky position. Well, how about this?\"\n\"Ugh, gggghhhh… this is… this is…\"\nA beautiful woman in a maid's uniform and a black cat were sitting together around a chessboard on the attic floor.\nShe had assumed that they were playing chess, but instead, she saw black and white pieces alternately stacked high on the chessboard.\nNero, the black cat, dexterously held the pieces with his paw and carefully placed them on top of the stacked pieces… but they lost their balance and fell apart.\n\"Damn, I knew it, play this game using my cat paw was going to be tough.\"\nNero was tapping the fallen pieces with his paw in frustration, while Louis's contracted spirit, Lynn, was cleaning up the scattered pieces unperturbed.\n\"…what are you doing?\"\nAt Monica enquire, Nero brazenly held up a chess piece and said.\n\"We're playing chess!\"\n\"In this game, players play by piling up black and white pieces alternately, and whoever makes them collapse loses. Currently, I have won seven games in a row.\"\nRealizing this was not the chess game she knew, Monica smiled wryly and got out of bed. Given that Lynn was here, perhaps it was already time to make the usual routine report?\nAs Monica sluggishly getting dressed, Lynn, still cleaning up the chess pieces, spoke.\n\"Sir Louis told me there will be a chess tournament today and a school festival in four days. Since there will be many outsiders coming in and out, he had ordered me to accompany you on guard duty.\"\nDuring the chess exchange matches, all the student council members, except for Monica and Elliot who will be taking part as players, would be in charge to receive students from other schools. Sure enough, with Nero and Lynn guarding Felix, Monica could concentrate on her chess without any worries.\nEver since after what had happened in Casey's case, Louis's caution was to be expected.\n\"Um… Lynn.\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"After that incident… What happened to Casey?\"\nCasey, who had attempted to assassinate Felix, was supposed to be executed, but instead was taken into custody by Louis on the condition, she must explain all the details honestly.\nBut should Casey refuse to be interrogated… Monica, who knows how merciless Louis can be, couldn't help but felt a shiver.\n\"Miss Casey Groove, daughter of Count Bright, complied with the interrogation. In that matters, Sir Louis has already been in contact with Count Bright in secret.\"\nCasey's father, Count Bright, has stated that he was entirely responsible for the incident and has stubbornly denied any connection to the Randall Kingdom.\nHowever, Louis suspected that the Randall Kingdom side was also behind the assassination plan and was investigating the source of the assassination magic tool, the [Conch Flame].\n\"Miss Casey Groove has been sent to a convent in the northeast just the other day.\"\n\"I, see…\"\nMonica's heart wrenched every time she remembered Casey's sorrowful voice.\nCasey felt indebted to the Randall Kingdom. So when she discovered that Duke Crockford was planning to invade Randall, she was determined to stop him.\nSooner or later, when Felix becomes king… Duke Crockford, Felix's backer, will probably drive Felix to attack the Randall Kingdom and eventually start a war with the Empire.\nThe Empire itself was formidable, but with the recent reign of a young emperor, the regime has been unstable. This had provided him a perfect opportunity to make a move on them.\nThat being said, Monica can't just sit back and watch Felix get assassinated.\n…I don't know which path should I choose.\nNone of each side was completely united.\nSome work for their personal fortune, some for the national interest, some for their ideals, some for peace, some for further development… A whirlwind of thoughts, ideals, and desires. This is what politics is all about.\nEven after becoming one of the Seven Sages, Monica kept away from political affairs and secluded herself in her cabin. She firmly believed that staying away from politics was the best thing to do.\nBut things can't be the same anymore.\nThe political struggles that Monica had turned a blind eye to until now were quietly coming to her doorstep.\n…why does His Highness, who is such an amazing person, always follow Duke Crockford words?\nEveryone knew Felix was very capable.\nIt was also a well-known fact that he was at the mercy of his maternal grandfather, the Duke of Crockford. Even Monica, who was not familiar with politics, had overheard about it.\n… Does His Highness want to go to war with Randall and the Empire… is he really fine to let this country be engulfed in a war…?\nMonica still couldn't grasp the person named Felix Ark Riddile.\nEven the same student council members, such as Cyril and Elliot, have shown more of their personalities and ideals compared to their first encounter.\nFor example, Cyril was a proud person who was strict with himself and others. He can be somewhat narrow-minded, but he was caring and attentive to those around him. He took pride in being recognized by Felix and was more devoted to that person than anyone else.\nElliot adhered to the status system and had a belief that nobles must act like nobles and commoners must act like commoners. Even his looks gave a frivolous impression, but at heart, was very earnest. And the fact that he felt uncomfortable when used a castling against Monica proved how earnest this person was.\nUp until now, Monica had always avoided interacting with people, but after she infiltrated Serendia Academy and came into contact with various people, she gradually began to see things more clearly. Which was, she can naturally understand about a person, once she knew what he/she valued the most.\nCasey wanted to protect her family.\nElliot took pride in being a nobleman.\nCyril was devoted to Felix.\nEveryone has their own values and beliefs, and they are all fighting to protect them.\n…Then what about His Highness? …What is His Highness fighting to protect?\nFrom Monica's standpoint, Felix was calm, friendly, and sociable… but no one knew what he was thinking.\nBut when he said…\nWhenever I show up at a tea party, no one offers me chocolates made with Randall's techniques. I mean, what's the harm in something that tastes good?\nThe cold look on his face as he blurted out how stupid the power struggle was…She didn't think that words were a lie.\nI can't let His Highness die. I won't let His Highness die.\nFor that reason, she had to make sure that both the chess tournament and the school festival four days later were successful. To do that, she needed to make sure to divide her role between Nero and Lynn.\nMonica turned to face Nero and Lynn.\n\"I would like to confirm today's arrangement. Nero, I want you to make sure if there are any suspicious magical reactions similar to the [Conch Flame] the other day. Lynn, as a wind spirit, you should be able to hear sounds from afar, right? Please keep an eye out for any suspicious conversations around His Highness.\"\nAt Monica's instruction, Nero chimed \"Got it!\" as he raised his paw proudly.\nLynn gave an \"understood\" nod and made one statement to Monica.\n\"To tell you the truth, I was discussing with Lord Nero how should we protect the second prince without attracting suspicion while playing this game.\"\n\"Oh, I just remembered. Watch me, Monica!\"\nParticles of light enveloped Nero and Lynn, changing their appearance. Eventually, the light subsided, replaced by two beautiful individuals dressed in Serendia Academy uniforms.\nOne was a wild-looking handsome man with black hair, the other was an elegant handsome man with short blond hair. The dark-haired one was Nero, of course, but the blond guy… perhaps…\n\"W-Whaaaat? Eeeeh? Are you by any chance… Lynn?\"\n\"Indeed, I am Louis Miller's contracted spirit, Lindbergfield.\"\nAccording to a book Monica had once read, spirits have no gender, so when they turn into humans, they can turn into either men or women. Still, witnessing her transformation from a woman to a man was a surprising experience. His frame was slender but definitely that of a grown man, while his voice was lower than usual.\n\"What do you think? This way we can walk around the school building without attracting suspicion!\"\nNext to Nero, who looked pleased with himself, Lynn took out a book expressionlessly.\n\"There was a scene in this novel where the heroine is tangled up with a bad guy, which ended up to be defended by her classmate by saying, ‘Don't touch my girl.'\"\n\"R-Right…\"\n\"If Miss Monica ever gets tangled up, I'll be sure to reenact this scene, so please rest assured and just let the bad guy tangle with you.\"\n\"…………\"\nAs Monica stood speechless, Nero's eyes glowed brightly.\n\"Oh, that sounds great! I want to do it too!\"\n\"I call this a love triangle between me, Miss Monica, and Lord Nero. What a thrilling development.\"\nFor Monica, this is a thrilling development in a negative way.\nMonica opened her mouth, putting a hand to her forehead with a pensive look on her face.\n\"You know, I think the uniforms you're wearing for someone of that age… would make you stand out even more…\"\n\"Wh-What!?\"\n\"I can't believe it…\"\nFor some reason, both of them did not seem to have an accurate grasp of their own outward age.\nBoth Nero and Lynn looked to be in their mid-twenties when they transformed into humans. Needless to say, they were suspicious people wearing uniforms.\nAfter Monica brought it up, they exchanged glances and began discussing strategies, such as what to wear, or what not to wear.\nIn the first place, Nero can turn into a cat and Lynn can turn into a bird. There's no need for them to transform into humans.\nRegardless of what Monica said, they were still arguing about what to wear, so she decided to leave them alone and leave the room.\nShe had promised Lana to visit her room today. She didn't have much time to relax.",

      "content": "Feeling uncertain about the future of this country, the pressure of guarding Felix, and the fear of meeting Minerva's people, Monica visited Lana's room, and now…\n…she being constricted by Lana.\n\"Uuuuuuh, this is so tiiiight.\"\n\"Come on, Monica! Just breathe out ‘heave-ho' like that.\"\n\"Ugh…\"\n\"Not \"Ugh…\" but ‘heave-ho'!\"\nLana walked behind Monica and pulled the straps of the corset tighter, quickly tying it up.\n\"It might be painful at first, but you'll get used to it… This dress could be considered a light dress, but when it comes to the ball dress, it would be much worse than this.\"\nApparently, the corset used for the ball was even heavier than this, as it included a frame to inflate the skirt. Realizing the efforts of the noblewomen behind the glamorous in the high social events, Monica put on her uniform over her corset.\nThe whole reason Lana had called Monica was to lend her this corset. On top of that, she would put some makeup on Monica as part of her practice for today's ball.\nLana sat Monica down in front of the dresser and called the maidservant to arrange her makeup. She then skillfully applied a thin layer of powdered paste on Monica's face.\n\"If it were an evening ball, I'd apply makeup to make you look dazzling, but I decided to keep it light today. Since it's a chess tournament, it's better to appear more intellectual.\"\nLana then instructed the maidservant to slant Monica's bangs slightly.\n\"We should give your forehead a little exposure. Since you tend to cast your head down and cover your face with your bangs, I think showing your face would change your impression.\"\nDo I really need to change my impression for a mere chess tournament? thought Monica in bewilderment, and then Lana added.\n\"I don't mean to pry, but…\"\n\"Eh?\"\n\"There might be a possibility of someone you don't want to meet… will be attending the chess tournament today.\"\nMonica's shoulders tense up.\nLana was absolutely right. While it was not certain someone she knew from Minerva would be there, the mere mention of \"Minerva's people\" was enough to make Monica feel uneasy.\nAs Monica fell silent, Lana flicked white powder on Monica's cheek and continued.\n\"You can change your impression a lot by putting on makeup and changing your hairstyle, and if things work out well, you might be able to deceive people you don't want to meet if you run into them.\"\"\n\"!!!\"\nTo Monica, who only thought about hiding her face by putting her hood over and turning away when she didn't want people to notice her presence, Lana's words were an eye-opener.\n\"My father used to say this. First impressions are mostly determined by posture and facial expressions. Physical appearance is usually secondary.\"\nFor this occasion, corsets seemed to have a stronger meaning of correcting posture than correcting body shape. Certainly, hunching over would cause the corset to tighten into the body, forcing the wearer to stretch his back straight.\nTo make her look even more radiant, Lana applied makeup to Monica's face.\nShe covered the pale and shaded skin with white powder and add a thin layer of rouge to the cheeks. The rough lips were glossed with beeswax cream, and then a thin layer of lipstick was applied to make them look more vivid. The eyebrows, which had not been groomed at all, were trimmed slightly.\n\"There you go! It's done!\"\nReflected in the mirror was a seventeen-year-old girl with a healthy complexion.\nMakeup didn't suddenly make her into a beautiful woman whom everyone would turn to. The image in the mirror was of a simple-looking girl with round eyes, a small nose, and a small mouth.\nBut if they saw Monica now, no one would mistake her for a child in her early teens. If anything, Monica, who always had an unhealthy complexion, looked healthier and brighter now. That alone was enough to shock her.\n\"I-I look like… seventeen!\"\n\"… was that the impression you should have to say right now?\"\n\"Also, I look so healthy…\"\n\"So you did aware that you looked unhealthy? You better improve your diet and sleep, you hear me?\"\nAlthough Lana sounded taken aback, she seemed satisfied with the quality of Monica's makeup.\nLana let out a triumphant snort and instructed the maidservant, \"Bring me\nthat\nthing.\"\nShe thought her current appearance was already nice enough, so she was wondering what kind of stuff she would bring in\n.\nWhile Monica was impressed by her reflection in the mirror, a maid behind her brought out some unfamiliar metal equipment.\nTo Monica, who had no idea what it was for, it looked like a torture device… But then the maidservant started to roast it over a fire.\n\"La-Lana… wh-what kind of torture device is that?\"\n\"You think this is a Torture device? Jeez… It's called a hair straightener.\"\n\"N-Not branding iron?\"\nWhen it comes to iron that was roasted over a fire, the image that comes to her mind was that of the branding iron used to brand livestock. When Monica shivered thinking about getting that thing on her skin, Lana gave her a half-hearted look.\n\"…I don't know what you are imagining, but… this is for curling hair.\"\n\"Curling… hair…?\"\nMonica, who had never heard of the culture of curling hair, could only make blank stares. Lana picked up the hair straightener and then faced Monica's hair.\n\"Well then, this is just the beginning. From now on, don't move your head even a slightly.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nIt was the morning of the chess tournament, and the student council members were ordered to come a little earlier to prepare for the arrival of the students from other schools. As soon as Monica stepped into the specified meeting room, the rest of the student council members saw her and their expressions changed.\nEveryone was looking at Monica, who was different from the norm. They were like \"Oh, which princess is this beautiful girl!\" …though, it's not the case.\n\"…Miss Norton, your appearance looks like a seventeen girl.\"\nThat was all Elliot managed to say.\nSome people might take offense at the rudeness of this line, but Monica nodded enthusiastically with a twinkle in her eyes.\n\"D-Did I look like, seventeen, years old?\"\n\"Yeah, that's a surprise. What's with all the makeup and hairstyle?\"\n\"M-My friend arranged it for me… Did I really look like seventeen years old?\"\n\"Yeah, you sure looked like a seventeen years old girl.\"\nElliot's crude speech made Monica squirm with excitement.\nFor Monica, who has always been told that she looks like a child and has a babyface, the phrase \"you looked like xxx years old\" was the best compliment she ever received.\nNow Monica was wearing a corset to correct her hunched back, applying makeup to brighten her complexion, and curling the ends of her light brown hair into a slight curl. Though her hair was adorned with the usual ribbons and not particularly flashy, the curly hair gave her a much different impression.\nThe current Monica was like a normal, healthy seventeen-year-old girl who could be found anywhere. The sad thing was, to the surprise of those around her, the usual Monica was a girl with an unhealthy complexion.\nCyril Ashley's eyes widened in amazement then muttered rude things such as \"I didn't know your face was looked like that…\"\nHe had probably identified Monica only by her features as \"a skinny little girl with light brown hair\" as she always kept her head down and tended to conceal her eyes.\nNeil honestly said, \"Wow, you look wonderful!\" and Bridget, who was generally harsh with Monica, only commented, \"You should do that much normally.\"\nAs Monica squirmed with excitement, Felix, who was standing in front of her, gently brushed aside a strand of Monica's hair and parted his lips.\n\"You look so lovely today. You are usually adorable, but today you are very beautiful. A butterfly might be tempted to rest its wings on a beautiful blossoming bud that had been closed tightly.\"\nMonica's thoughts paused for a few seconds. Her brain, which was not used to this kind of expression, took a very long time to understand the poetic and literary phrases.\nSo, Monica decided to ask straight away.\n\"…then, did I look like, seventeen, years old?\"\n\"Yeah, you did.\"\n\"Mmmmm!!\"\nFelix was muttering \"You were more pleased with that compliment, huh\" to himself when he saw Monica was squirming in delight.\nMonica has never been interested in fashion. In fact, it would be fair to say that she was indifferent to it. For her, who has been hiding away in her cabin without seeing anyone, being fashionable was something unnecessary.\nHowever, ever since she came to Serendia Academy and Lana taught her how to braid hair, Monica's consciousness had started to change, if only slightly. At least, to the extent that she was concerned about Claudia calling her a \"toddler.\"\n\"It is about time, Your Highness. I think you should leave it at that.\"\nBridget chimed in, casting her eyes over her watch.\nFelix reluctantly withdrew his hand from Monica's face and then gave instructions to all the student council members.\n\"Well then, I guess it's about time we welcome the students from \"Temple\" and \"Minerva\".\"\nThe mention of the name of the institute she had once attended brought Monica back to her senses.\nIt'll be fine, I'm sure it'll be fine… as long as I keep my posture good and keep my composure, they won't notice me unless things go horribly wrong.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"Barney, Barney, what are those people doing?\"\n\"Oh, they are playing chess. It could be categorized as a board game… a game for those with too much spare time in their hands.\"\nBarney snickered mockingly, looked at the people of the chess club from a distance.\n\"They came to Minerva to study magic, but then creating a chess club, it's beyond ludicrous. We are at the pinnacle of a magician training institution, so shouldn't we be concentrating on studying magic?\"\nThat's what Barney had said when Monica was still attending at Minerva. And because of that reason, somewhere in the back of her mind, Monica had assumed that Barney would never take a part in chess, but…\n\"Nice to meet you. I'm Barney Jones, President of the Minerva Chess Club.\"\nThe sight of the bespectacled young man shaking hands with Felix had left Monica speechless.\nHis height was taller and his voice was lower from what she had remembered, but… she would never have mistaken him for someone else.\nWhy… why are you here…\nStanding at the head of Minerva's students was a man who had once been Monica's best friend.\n…why are you here… Barney!?",

      "content": "The people from \"Minerva\" and \"The Academy\" who came to visit Serendia Academy were consisting of three male students and a teacher, four people each.\nThe Temple's students had their hair cut short, giving out the image of serious students which was embodied the strict culture of the school. The teacher leading them was a man with black hair cropped short and sharp eyes in his mid-forties.\nOn the other hand, Minerva's students, including their captain, Barney Jones, were all boys with a scholarly air about them. Which was led by a young male teacher with a somewhat unreliable appearance.\nApart from Barney, Monica had never met any of the other students or the teacher who was leading them. Perhaps the teacher had been assigned to the school after Monica had graduated.\nSo, that leaves only one person here who knew about Monica Everett of the Silent Witch. And that was…\n\"Hi, I'm Barney Jones. Nice to meet you.\"\n\"…I'm Monica Norton.\"\nThe representative from each school exchanged their greeting with each other.\nMonica had been paying attention to Barney's movements, but his attitude had not changed in any particular way. He probably hasn't noticed that Monica was here. It was thanks to Lana's makeup.\n…Also, I need to maintain my posture and facial expressions. Posture and facial expressions.\nIt was difficult for her to smile as naturally as the others, but she kept her lips tight and straightened her back so as not to appear nervous.\nThanks to the corset, she felt much taller than usual, with a straighter spine.\nClaiming that she had become a different person than usual would be an exaggeration to say, but the makeup that Lana applied helped to give Monica a little more courage.\nIt's alright, it'll be fine. He hasn't noticed me.\nAs Monica was desperately convincing herself, Dan Redding, the teacher from Temple, observed the people from Serendia Academy then opened his mouth.\n\"…I suppose this year's representatives was different from last year's.\"\nDespite his stern face, his tone was polite, and Boyd, the teacher with a mercenary-like face from the Serendia Academy side, nodded heavily.\n\"We change our representative every year.\"\n\"I've been looking forward to competing with the last year's students Serendia Academy since they were very strong. Don't you think so too, Sir Pittman?\"\nA teacher from Minerva called Pitman seemed to be in a bit of a daze.\nAfter being called out repeatedly by Redding, he suddenly gave a smile and responded.\n\"Ah, yes, that's right. Yeah.\"\nFrom the looks of it, Redding from Temple seemed to be a rigid person, while Pittman from Minerva was to be a rather airhead person.\nAs the two teachers gave compliments to last year's students from Serendia Academy, Boyd, the representative of Serendia Academy, made a short declaration in a low voice that seemed to echo from the depths of the earth.\n\"Our student this year is strong.\"\nBoyd may not be a teacher of many words, but his short words always carried weight.\nRedding's face tensed up just a little. Pittman, though, was still airhead as ever.\n\"…Yeah, I'm looking forward again to this year's tournament.\"\n\"Oh, please be easy on me.\"\nThe match hadn't started yet, but the teachers were already igniting the sparks way before the students could.\nWhile the chess tournament may be called an exchange event between the three schools, it was also an opportunity for the three most prestigious schools to compete with each other for the top spot.\nIn the past, the \"Temple\" side had set a record for consecutive victories, but after Serendia Academy's overwhelming victory last year, they seemed to be particularly on edge.\nRedding glanced at Monica and narrowed his eyes slightly.\n\"So Serendia Academy got a female student as a representative again this year? Well, Miss Ashley was a very strong player last year. And, Miss Norton, was it? I hope your skills were up to our expectations.\"\nThe sudden attention made Monica's shoulders jolt.\nBy far, there were fewer women chess players than men. Even more so when it comes to representing their school. The sole fact that Monica was a female student was enough to attract the attention of the people around her.\nMonica went stiff, cupping both her hands tightly in front of her body when Boyd tapped her shoulder with his large hand.\n\"She's a promising newcomer.\"\n\"I'm looking forward to it. Very much.\"\nShe thought she saw sparks fly between Boyd and Redding. Maintaining her posture and expression, Monica began to calculate Pi in her head.\n\"You sure are getting a lot of attention, Miss Norton.\"\nElliot made a light-hearted remark to Monica, perhaps trying to lighten the mood.\nBut Monica was far from listening to Elliot's snide remarks.\n\"Hey, Miss Norton? Hey!\"\nElliot waved his hand fluttering in front of Monica, but of course, she didn't hear him.\n\"2847564823378678316527120190914564856692…\"\n\"…Oh, crap. This is just like with the accounting.\"\nAs Elliot shook while placed his hand on his forehead, Monica continuously recited Pi with her back straight tensely.\nJust as the people around her began to look at Monica strangely, Benjamin Moulding, Middle Player from Serendia Academy, raised his voice.\n\"Have no worry! The trio grazioso (grace) performed by our Serendia Academy will surely capture all of your hearts! If the superb piano is Miss Norton, and the light violin is Elliot, then I am a cellist with the ability to change and shake the hearts of those who listen! Oh, I can hear it, I can hear it… the emotional clamor of the audience whose souls have been shaken by our musical chess!\"\nWith Monica trapped in the world of numbers, and Benjamin trapped in the world of music.\nElliot, who sandwiched between the two of them, wore a face full of fatigue even before the match had started, then looked up at Boyd.\n\"…Now I finally understand why you chose me as the captain, Prof. Boyd.\"\nIn other words, it was an unlucky role in taking care of them.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nWhile Monica continued to recite Pi, the captains of each school drew lots to determine the match-ups.\nThe first match will be held in the morning, \"Serendia Academy\" vs \"Temple\".\nThe second match will be held after lunch, \"Minerva\" vs \"Serendia Academy\".\nThe third match will be held after a short break, \"Temple\" vs. \"Minerva\".\nThe match against Minerva where Barney was, would be held after lunch.\nNow Barney was the captain of Minerva, he would not be able to match up against Monica, the front player.\nFollowing the opening speech, the first match will begin after a short break.\nBefore the match started, Monica left the waiting room and went to the makeup room where the mirror was set up. She was slightly worried whether her hair, which Lana had tied up for her, was still in good form.\nSerendia Academy has a large number of young ladies from noble families, so they had many makeup rooms for use.\nMonica jogged to the nearest makeup room. After making sure her hair and makeup were intact, she stared straight at the reflection in the mirror.\nShe saw a seventeen-year-old girl with a healthy complexion.\nShe has a mirror in the cabin where she used to live. It was brought in by Louis Miller, who could not stand the sight of Monica's appearance, and pestered, \"You should be a little more mindful about your appearance.\"\nHowever, she rarely used that mirror. Because she had no interest in getting dressed and thought she could just wear a hood when she went out in public.\n…But now, I think I understand why Louis told me to be mindful of my appearance.\nIn the world of society, appearance was one of its weapons. This has been proved in the case of Felix and Bridget.\nAnd being well dressed was like being well-armed.\nWith that in mind, the corset she wore started to feel like armor. At first, she hated it because it was so tight, but now it made her felt reassured.\nFacing the mirror, Monica whispered to herself,\n\"…Y-You can do it!\"\nThough she felt a little embarrassed to say her resolution out loud, it gave her a sense of courage nevertheless.\nAfter feeling convinced with herself, she left the makeup room. There were still a few minutes left before the first game started, but it would be better to return early.\nAs she hurriedly walked down the hallway, she caught sight of a figure turning the corner of the hallway ahead of her.\nThe moment she saw that figure, Monica's legs cowered.\n\"Pardon me, Miss Monica Norton.\"\nBlond hair with a slight quirk, nostalgic glasses, and the neatly dressed Minerva uniform. The person who stopped Monica was her former best friend, Barney Jones.\nMonica gulped.\nWhat kind of response would be the most appropriate here? If she spoke carelessly, she felt like her secrets will be exposed.\nThe best thing to do would be to say, \"I'm in a hurry,\" and walk by.\nAnd yet, when Barney spoke to her for the first time in a long time, the nostalgia and the sadness were filling up inside her heart, causing her tracks to stop.\nEven after being shunned so harshly, Monica was still happy to hear Barney talking to her.\n\"Can I have a moment?\"\nMonica kept her mouth shut and gave a small nod.\nIt will be fine, I'm sure he hasn't found out yet… she tried to convince herself so.\n\"I was surprised when I saw you. You looked like an old acquaintance I used to know. Coincidentally, you even shared the same name.\"\nAn old acquaintance—I knew you wouldn't call me your friend anymore, Monica thought, secretly disappointed and surprised at how discouraged she was.\nShe realized how much she still wanted to be friends with Barney. Even though he hated her so much.\n\"By the way, Miss Norton. Have you been attending Serendia Academy last year?\"\n\"…………\"\nIf she nodded here, sooner or later, her lie would be exposed. But if she shook her head, she might just solidify Barney's suspicions.\nWhether she should answer or not, this situation made Monica hesitate.\nAnd that hesitation had caused a fatal mistake.\n\"Is there some circumstances you can't give me an answer?\"\nBefore she knew it, Barney had closed the distance between himself and Monica.\nWhen he stood closer, she realized how much taller Barney had become. In the past, she only needed to raise her eyes a little to make eye contact. Now she has to tilt her head upward to see his face.\nThe sharp eyes behind the glasses were coldly cornering Monica, who took a step back, then rapidly closing the distance, to not let her get away.\nWhat should I do, what should I do, what should I do…?\nMonica clasped her hands together in front of her chest as she trembled. Her frightened demeanor made Barney's eyes grow colder and colder.\nHe's angry, for sure. I have to apologize, I have to ask him to forgive me…\nJust as Monica was about to utter an apology with her trembling lisp, someone pulled her tightly back against him.\n\"Hey, don't you dare touch my girl.\"\nHugging Monica's waist was a dark-haired young man in a gorgeous formal dress.\nN-Neroooooooooo!?\nWhy is he wearing a formal dress, and why did he have to reenact the thing from this morning at this point in time?\nAs Monica was lost in thought, another slumping weight fell on her other shoulder.\nSlightly moving her eyes, she saw a beautiful blonde-haired man wearing a formal dress as glamorous as Nero's—Lynn—holding Monica's shoulder.\n\"Don't you dare touch my woman, boy.\"\nHis dialogue overlaps with Nero's!!!\nMonica's eyes widened to their limit as her mouth gaped.\nHowever, Barney was probably more surprised than her. After all, out of nowhere, two flamboyantly dressed men appeared and interrupted them.\n\"W-Who are you two…\"\nI wonder who are they, really, Monica thought. Of course, she didn't have the guts to say it out loud.\nNevertheless, the fact that both Nero and Lynn seemed to be enjoying themselves with such vivacity was also a real headache.\nNero, for example, has a twinkle in his eye. He wasn't rushing in here because he was worried about Monica, but to enjoy this situation.\nTo top it all off, Lynn declared to Barney with a very serious face.\n\"I might find a love triangle form is beautiful, but a love square is a bit too much for me personally…so I'm afraid I must ask you to leave it.\"\nTalk about a wild argument.\nHowever, whether pressured by the strange momentum or feeling ridiculous, Barney retreated snidely and lifted his misplaced glasses with his fingertips.\n\"… sorry for bothering you before the match.\"\nWith that, Barney turned his back on Monica and walked away.\nAfter confirming Barney was no longer in sight, Monica slumped to the spot.\n\"Well, did you see my great performance? You can fall in love with me, Monica.\"\n\"I feel like I've accomplished my entire mission for the day with this one performance.\"\nLooking up at the satisfied Nero and Lynn, Monica asked in a deadpan voice.\n\"…Um, you two, what are you wearing…?\"\nThe clothes that Nero and Lynn were wearing were gorgeous enough to indicate that they were going to an evening party. It was no longer the level of being out of place.\nTo Monica's remark, Lynn replied with great seriousness.\n\"Yesterday, you pointed out that it was too unnatural for us to wear uniforms with our appearance, so we decided to have some improvements.\"\n\"…improvements.\"\nWhen Monica muttered in a hollow voice, Lynn nodded curtly.\n\"The idea was to create ‘a couple of excited cheerful boys who wore formal wear even though the school festival hadn't started yet.'\"\n\"It was such a perfect disguise, right?!\"\nBoth Lynn and Nero acted as if nothing was wrong.\nSandwiched between the two glittering handsome men, Monica couldn't help but cover her face with her hands.\n\"…You know, both of you… I'm grateful you've come to help me… but please… please, I'm really, really, really begging you… please stay in your cat and bird forms…\"\nMonica was regretting her decision to not press the two of them this morning, as much as she was dying to do so.",

      "content": "The chess tournament was held in the dance hall of Serendia Academy.\nEven though three representatives from each school would be playing at the same time, the dance hall, which was far too large, was chosen as the venue to provide seating for the spectators.\nThe spectator seats are set up at a certain distance from the players to no interrupt their concentration.\nHowever, as the distance was too great for the spectators to see the match, the student council had prepared three large boards to resemble a chessboard. Pins that looked like pieces were fastened to these boards to show the situation of the game in real-time.\nThird-year students taking an elective chess class at Serendia Academy took turns managing the board and hosting the games. While both teachers and student council members were watching the game from separate seats, as were the rest of the spectators.\n\"Let me inform you, this year's \"Temple\" is strong. After all, we've got an excellent newcomer from a neighboring country, who came all the way to study at the \"Temple\" to pursue chess studies. Among the students from the neighboring country of Randall, he is said to be an unbeatable chess player.\"\nAs Redding, the teacher from \"Temple\" rambles on, Pittman, the teacher from Minerva, seated next to him, softly chimes in.\n\"Coming all the way from a neighboring country to study in \"Temple\"? Now that's amazing.\"\n\"Indeed, practically he's a very talented student, but he's a little hard-headed, you see. I have intended to make him captain of the team, but he stubbornly insists on becoming the front player because he is a newcomer. Well, I feel a little sorry for the front player of Minerva and Serendia Academy.\"\nRedding didn't look very apologetic—in fact, he looked somewhat proud of himself as he said this, and looked at the two men sitting at the front player table.\nRepresenting the \"Temple\" side was a promising newcomer, Roberto Vincere. In contrast, the \"Serendia Academy\" front player was Monica Norton, the sole girl in that group.\n\"Well, oh, well, what a poor girl. As a girl, she seems to be able to play a little bit, but against our ace, it must be a bit much for her.\"\nWith that, Redding glanced at Boyd's stern face. With a grim face as if he were on the battlefield, Boyd responded with a low voice.\n\"Let me apologize in advance.\"\n\"Well, now, what are you apologizing for? Could it be that girl is too weak to be an opponent?\"\n\"I apologize for making Monica Norton the front player.\"\n\"Oh, I suppose Serendia Academy went out of their way to choose female students to liven things up? Or perhaps that girl came from a family with a large donation? Well, I guess Serendia Academy has a different school culture from the meritocratic \"Temple\". I'm sure that's the case, yes.\"\nBoyd didn't even look at Redding when he rambled on. He just kept his eyes straight on the students before opening his mouth.\n\"I've chosen Monica Norton as the front player because she was too inexperienced.\"\n\"Right, ladies rarely have the chance to play chess. So how long has she been playing chess? A year, maybe?\"\nBoyd showed him two of his thick fingers as Redding asked with a chuckle.\n\"Two weeks.\"\nWhile the teachers were having their conversation, a certain person had overheard them. He was the Minerva representative, Barney Jones. He raised his thin eyebrows and glared at Monica, who sat in the distance, with glinted eyes.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nMonica took a seat at the table provided, holding her aching stomach.\nThe pain in her stomach was not due to the pressure of the game. It was caused by the nervousness of knowing that Barney might discover her true identity and the anxiety about whether Nero and Lynn would not cause a ruckus while watching over His Highness.\nAlthough she wanted to believe that Nero and Lynn would be fine because she had repeatedly reminded them… she was still worried because they both seemed to have taken a liking to\nthat\noutfit.\nAs she let out a sigh, a male student from \"Temple\" sitting in front of her expressed his concern to Monica.\n\"Are you not feeling well?\"\n\"I-I'm fine.\"\n\"Really?\"\nThe boy who introduced himself as Roberto Vincere was apparently sixteen years, a year younger than Monica, but his appearance seems to say otherwise. Not only was he tall, but his muscular figure looked more suited to swords and spears than chess. Along with his stiff black hair was cut short and his earnest look, he has represented the very typical figure of the student of \"Temple\".\nFor now, I need to focus on what's in front of me.\n\"It's time. Let's have a good match.\"\n\"L-let's have… a good matck—\"\nShe bit her tongue.\nOh, this is so embarrassing. I hope there's a hole for me to hide… she thought in depression, but it only took a few seconds for her to regain her composure. When she looked up and faced the chessboard, the embarrassment and anxiety in Monica's mind disappeared, and only the chessboard occupied her mind.\nRoberto was slightly surprised to see the apparent change in Monica's atmosphere. But not even his response can be perceived by Monica now. All she could see now were the pieces on the board.\nAnd so, Monica picked up the white knight and moved it with a curt motion.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAs the match began, Glenn Dudley (an always energetic seventeen-year-old guy) was sitting in the spectator section, made an O shape with his palm over his mouth, and tried to give a cheering… Noticing this, Neil, who was sitting next to him, covered his mouth.\n\"Don't shout during the game!\"\n\"Ogbh… I just wanted to say, ‘Good luck, Monica.'\"\n\"No means no.\"\nAs Lana's cheeks twitched at their exchange, Claudia smiled sinisterly. This was a smile that definitely didn't have anything good in mind.\n\"… so cheering loudly for Monica here will getting a mouth covered by Neil's hand… how vexing…\"\n\"I don't find any of this to be vexing about. Hey, more importantly, how's the match going? Who's winning now?\"\nClaudia looked at Lana's words with a look of utter dismay.\n\"…How can you expect to know the winner at this early stage?\"\nLana, who didn't know much about chess, fell silent in embarrassment. Then Glenn, who had been released from Neil's hands, said in a slightly lower volume of voice than usual.\n\"Hey, don't you think the match in Monica's table progressing too quickly? It seems like the pieces are shifting twice as fast as the other tables.\"\nAs Glenn had said, only the front player's pieces' live board, which imitated their progress in chessboard were moving at an unusual speed. Students who were in charge of moving the pieces on the live board looked at the board and the chessboard alternately in a hurry.\nLana asked Claudia, aware that question could lead her to be ridiculed.\n\"Hey, does chess follow a rule that the faster you play, the more advantage you get?\"\n\"…Chess has a time limit, so there's nothing wrong with playing fast. But what happened at Monica's table was clearly too fast.\"\nMónica always took less than three seconds to make her next move right after Roberto made his move. From an outsider's point of view, she seemed to be moving her pieces without thinking. So Glenn clapped his hands.\n\"I get it! With that fast pacing method, you can put pressure on your opponent!\"\nAt Glenn's words, Neil gave him a difficult look.\n\"…Certainly, there are some people who take that approach… but…\" Neil trailed off and let out a small exclamation of admiration at the unfolding board.\n\"I doubt Miss Norton was thinking of putting pressure on her opponent or anything like that…\"\nLana and Glenn, being amateurs, couldn't tell, but Neil and Claudia's expressions clearly changed when they saw Monica's match.\nNot just these two, but everyone who understood chess was watching the front player game with rapt attention.\n——On the chessboard, a terribly high-level match was being played at a frighteningly fast pace.\nWhen Roberto was on the offensive, Monica handled him with extreme precision. It was as if Monica had known the move was coming all along. The next move, and dozens of moves beyond that, progressing by reading each other's hands.\nThe difference in the level of the front player match with the other player matches was obvious to everyone, except for about two people, Lana and Glenn.\nSitting at the teacher's station, the \"Temple\" teacher looked very pale and said, \"Two weeks? What? Two weeks!?\" And Barney Jones, sitting at Minerva's section, casting his glaring dark eyes not at the board but at Monica.\n\"Checkmate.\"\nAfter Monica quietly declared, Roberto clenched his fists on his lap and hung his head.\n\"…I lost.\"\nThe match, which was the most high-level game in the tournament, was over in a surprisingly brief period of time, and with nearly an hour to spare, the \"Temple\" won the middle player and captain matches.\nThe final outcome was two wins and one loss for the \"Temple\" side. But everyone in the room understood.\n—who's the strongest person in this place was.",

      "content": "I changed the name Roberto Vincere to Roberto Vinkel\nAfter the first match, the student council hosted a simple buffet party that served as a social gathering exchange. Only representatives from each school, teachers, and student council members were allowed to participate. The students who had come to watch the game returned to their dormitories for lunch.\nSo as not to draw attention to herself, Monica stood in a corner of the hall scanning her surroundings. She saw Barney chatting and eating with fellow Minerva students. Though he showed no signs of trying to approach Monica, she could not afford to let her guard down. It was better to keep as much distance as possible.\nWhile Monica had these thoughts in mind, Elliot and Benjamin approached her with plates of a light meal.\n\"I've seen your game record, Miss Norton.\"\nHe sounded somewhat regretful.\nAfter all, Monica was the only one who won the match against the House, while Elliot and Benjamin lost.\nI hope I didn't make things uncomfortable because I was the only one who won…\nas Monica thought while freaked out, Elliot looked into Monica's face at extremely close range and pressed his index finger between her forehead.\n\"Oh, looks like you've been holding back pretty much in the practice match we've done before.\"\n\"N-Noooo, not at all, absolutely not!\"\n\"Really, anyone who looked at this game record would think this match was like practicing a handicap game. What kind of match was that… Using new moves that defy traditional strategies, and in the last moment, you managed to achieve a complete reversal, I think this game has already gone into the history books of the chess world.\"\n\"I-I don't think that would be…\"\nAs she desperately tried to find an excuse while having her forehead pressed down, Benjamin gently reminded Elliot, \"Don't be too hard on your junior,\" then continued with,\n\"A concerto can only be created when both performers are on par with each other, and only then can a beautiful composition be created. In this match, her opponent was extremely strong. That's why Miss Norton was able to show off her abilities to the fullest… In other words, the fact that she hasn't been able to show off her true abilities until now is due to our inability. Don't be too hard on yourself… Oh, if it were possible, I would have liked to see the moment this beautiful music was born with my own eyes, not on the board! I wish I could have seen it! Oh, God! Why was I chosen as a representative! I wish I could have been a spectator.\"\nAlthough Benjamin's words were an exaggeration, he was spot on. Her opponent, Roberto Winkel, was the strongest opponent Monica had ever faced, which allowed her to explore new moves.\nIt was a fun match\n, Monica thought absentmindedly when she saw someone approaching her.\nDespite being younger than her, he has a large, toned physique, short black hair, and a sharp, fearless face—It was exactly the person they've been talked about, Monica's opponent, Roberto Winkel.\n\"Miss Monica Norton.\"\nWhen her name was called, Monica's shoulders jolted and she unconsciously hid behind Elliot and Benjamin.\nMonica was extremely shy, especially when it came to large men like Roberto. Her uncle, who had once beaten her, had been a huge man, and that fear always haunted her.\nTo tell the truth, Nero in his humanoid form was also quite a tall man, which Monica found difficult to deal with. Monica was getting jittery, and Roberto took a standing position like a soldier and opened his mouth.\n\"I was very impressed with the match earlier.\"\n\"Th-Thanks…\"\n\"Therefore…\"\nRoberto opened his eyes with a snap and looked at Monica, who was trembling with fear.\n\"I want to make an engagement with you based on chess!\"\nA voice that resonated deeply from the bottom of his stomach, echoed throughout the hall.\nCyril spurted out his drink, while Neil exclaimed, \"An engagement?!\" and Bridget gave him a cold look as if he were a fool who couldn't read the atmosphere.\nFelix was still smiling with his usual calm smile—only, he was looking at Monica and the others with a certain amount of disquiet in his heart.\nElliot, who was closest to her, was speechless with his eyes and mouth open. Monica, like most people, was also flabbergasted.\nIn the midst of this delicate atmosphere, the first to open his mouth was Benjamin.\n\"How deplorable!\"\nBenjamin shook out his flaxen hair and gazed up at the ceiling.\n\"Love is supposed to be a more passionate and emotionally stirring affair! There is no beauty in it! That proposal is not musically beautiful! Not even close to being a bad piece of music!\"\nBenjamin expressed his sorrow with his whole body and started to talk about his own theory of how love was supposed to be. The situation was about to get out of hand when Elliot, the group leader, got the role of mediator, took over.\n\"Oh, you know what? Music and all that aside, now… what kind of proposal was that? I'd let it a slide if it was a normal engagement, but an engagement based on chess, this is my first time hearing of it.\"\n\"I apologize for my lack of words! Let me explain my thoughts now, and I hope that Miss Norton could give it positive consideration!\"\nRoberto continued to speak in an upright position and in a ridiculously serious manner.\n\"I was struck by Miss Norton's chess. She is the first person of her age who has been able to overwhelm me. If I could, I would love to play more chess with her…but we are from different schools and have nothing in common. However! Being engaged would give us a reason to meet on weekends and during long vacations! We can play chess there to the fullest! Therefore, I would like to ask you to propose you to become my fiancée, Miss Norton!\"\nIndeed, the meant of \"an engagement based on chess\" were true to its words, and the explanation was foolishly honest.\n\"Wow… he's so selfish, it's almost refreshing.\"\n\"…it's not so musical… not even beautiful…\"\nEven though Elliot and Benjamin's faces were scrunched up, Roberto continued to speak with no concern for them.\n\"I am the fifth son of a baron in the Randall Kingdom. Perhaps, I won't be able to inherit the title, but I plan to join the Randall Knights eventually. Those who excel in chess can become candidates for the commander of the knight order. I pride myself on the fact that my future is quite secure! And my family, the baronial family, is free of debts! Both of my parents are upstanding! I'm on good terms with my brothers! I also have three dogs! Please feel free to consider marrying into our family at ease!\"\nThe situation has gone too far.\nA-A-Anyway, I have to decline…\nIn the first place, Monica Norton was her temporary identity. Her true identity was that of one of the Seven Sages who was infiltrating school as the second prince's bodyguard. The engagement was not possible.\n\"I-I'm sorry! I… I-I can't…!\"\n\"Why? Do you already have a fiancé?\"\n\"I-I don't, but…\"\nWhat a stupidly honest answer, Elliot thought as he looked at Monica in amazement. However, Monica was not skilled enough to tell an appropriate lie in such a situation. When Monica fidgeted around, Roberto urged her further.\n\"If you are worried about marrying into another country, please rest assured. I will do my best to support you in every aspect of your life: lifestyle, language, and social circles. I want you to feel comfortable in your own life and let you focus on chess.\"\n\"No, I mean, I'm… I'm sorryyyyyyyyyyy!\"\nUnable to stand it any longer, Monica flew out from behind Elliot's back and ran towards the hallway. Despite her shabby and pathetic running style, it was Monica's way of running as fast as she could.\n\"Miss Norton! I haven't done talking…\"\nWhen Roberto tried to follow Monica, a pair of hands suddenly pressed on both of his shoulders. Felix had his hand on his right shoulder, and Cyril had his hand on his left.\nIt looked like a slight tap on the shoulder to the casual observer, but if one looked closely, the pressure was strong enough to cause wrinkles on the clothes.\n\"Excuse me, she's a member of our student council. Why don't you talk to me about it first?\"\n\"You're behaving inappropriately in an exchange gathering. As a student council member, I can't overlook this.\"\nFelix was smiling, but his eyes weren't. On the other hand, Cyril has a cold, indifferent expression on his face, spreading cold air. And Elliot, his face tightened at the sight of impending chaos.",

      "content": "After running out of the banquet venue, Monica stopped in her tracks when she reached down the end of the stairs that connected the second floor to the first floor.\nDue to her lack of exercise, she was out of breath after only a short run. Leaning her back against the wall, Monica tried to regulate her ragged breathing.\n…That was scared me.\nNeedless to say, that was the first time someone has proposed an engagement to her.\nRoberto was neither attracted to Monica's looks nor her personality. He was just attracted to Monica's chess skills and proposed to her to be his fiancee so that they could have more opportunities to play chess.\nIf it was someone else who had been there, most people would have raised an eyebrow and said, \"That's ridiculous\" However, Monica found it reasonable and even impressive.\nWhatever people say about falling in love or loving someone, the idea of love simply didn't make sense to Monica who had never been in love.\nRather than being told that he was in love with her looks which were less than average, has no social skills, and can't say anything clever, it would be easier to understand if he just honestly told her that he proposed engagement because he wanted to play chess.\nBut that did not change the fact she couldn't accept the engagement itself.\nThis is going to be troublesome…\nReturning to the venue now would obviously be a bad idea.\nPerhaps I should hide somewhere until the upcoming match against Minerva begins…\nAs she was considering this, she saw something flickering up ahead.\n\"………eh?\"\nFive flaming arrows were floating in front of Monica.\nThe moment Monica uttered a sound, those flaming arrows flew straight towards her. It was an attack that a normal person would be unable to avoid. But Monica instantly formed a barrier with no chanting, preventing the flaming arrow from reaching her.\n\"I knew it… you are\nthat\nMonica.\"\nA voice came from the upper stairs sent a chill down Monica's spine. She looked up slowly and saw Barney standing on a stair landing. His face was shaded in contrast to the light coming through the glass window, displaying the cruel smile which clearly visible on his face.\nHe then descended the stairs slowly and stood in front of Monica, who remained cowering, unable to move an inch, and scoffed at her.\n\"Why are the Seven Sages pretending to be students in this school? Was the rumor that you were holed up in a mountain cabin a total fabrication?\"\n\"No… I…\"\nMonica desperately tried to speak. But as she was unable to get the words out, her vision went dizzy.\n\"Could it be that you're hiding your true identity to start your school life all over again? Pretending to be a student at Serendia Academy, the most prestigious school in this kingdom, how extravagant your playing could be. On top of that, you've got several guys in your romantic life… haha, you seem to have a fulfilling life.\"\nMonica was dumbfounded at the mention of having a man in her romantic life. Perhaps, or even without considering… he was referring to\nthat\nincident.\nHe's talking about Nero and Lynn!!!\nApparently, Barney had taken her familiar and that spirit's all-out prank to heart. But she can't honestly tell him all the details, since the mission to escort the second prince was top-secret.\nWhile Monica was hanging over her head pondering, Barney reached over and touched the ribbon tied in Monica's hair.\n\"You've changed your look quite a bit, haven't you? It never crossed my mind that it might be you until I heard your name… you seem to have changed a lot even when you can't even talk to people properly. Are you trying to be stylish?\"\n\"I…\"\n\"Good for you, isn't it? A man from a neighboring country even proposed to you.\"\n\"…………..\"\nThe more Barney's words cut into Monica's heart, the more hurt she appeared to be, and the deeper his smile grew.\n\"Oh, I get it. You pretended to be a helpless student to get close to the second prince, didn't you? It sounds like something you'd do… pretend to be helpless and then get on someone's good side… so you can take advantage of their kindness, right? Like a parasite!\"\nMonica was stunned by the severe insults thrown at her.\n…Is that what Barney thought of me?\nIf only they could talk again like they used to… but that sliver of hope was trampled on by Barney with a mock. Monica Everett was hated by Barney. She was ostracized. She was despised—that was the reality.\nThe corners of Monica's eyelids were slowly growing hot.\nI can't cry here.\nClenching her teeth, Monica struggled to hold back a sob. But the back of her nose was still tingling. The hopelessness made her want to collapse at her feet and cry out loudly.\n\"A devious person like you is bound to be disregarded by everyone in no time!\"\nI know. I know that nobody will ever want me for anything.\nNevertheless, in her childhood, Monica was happy that Barney stretching out his helping hand. That was why she just wanted to be proud of becoming his \"friend\"… nothing more.\nI guess I was too selfish in wanting you to accept me as your friend.\n\"Stop right there!\"\nA valiant girl's voice echoed in the hallway.\nAs Monica lifted her head, she saw a girl running toward her with the hem of her skirt fluttering wide. It was Lana Colette. She stepped in between Monica and Barney and glared at Barney with glaring, sharp eyes.\n\"I might not have heard the conversation, but what the hell is going on here? You're from Minerva, right?\"\n\"Oh, pardon me. Are you a student of this school?\"\n\"I asked you what kind of situation is this. Why don't you answer me? …Or is it common practice in Minerva to corner a girl in the hallway and make her cry?\"\nWhen Lana lifted her thin chin and glared at Barney, he plastered a thin smile on his face and shrugged his shoulders.\n\"I apologize for not introducing myself. My name is Barney Jones and I'm a representative of Minerva. Monica and I are old acquaintances. We were chatting about the old days, and she got emotional and started crying because of nostalgia.\"\nIn response to Barney's smooth speech, Lana glared at him suspiciously.\n\"So… you're the person… that Monica didn't want to meet.\"\nLana muttered to herself and looked at Monica who was on the verge of crying.\n\"Let's go to the makeup room, I'll fix your makeup there.\"\n\"O-Okay…\"\nAfter saw Monica nodded, Lana gave Barney a gracious lady's smile.\n\"I apologize, Lord Jones. I have to fix my friend's makeup, so if you'll excuse me.\"\n\"……friend?\"\nAt Lana's words, Barney's thin eyebrows raised and a smirk crept into his mouth.\n\"I think you should stop befriending that person. I am sure you would end up feeling unpleasant later. She is trying to take advantage of others by pretending she can't do anything herself, after all.\"\nHearing Bernie's words, Monica's body trembled as if she had been lashed with a whip.\n\"HAAAAH!?\"\nLana's ladylike smile twitched, and a blue streak popped up on her forehead.\n\"Monica is not the kind of person who would do such a thing.\"\n\"She's pretending to be helpless, feigning can't do anything, but mocking others behind their back.\"\nLana's eyes coldly looked at Bernie.\n\"You really don't know much about people, do you? Why don't you get yourself a new pair of glasses instead of those ugly ones with no sense of style?\"\nThis time, the smiling Barney's face twitched.\nLana and Barney both wore their most formal smiles, but their eyes weren't, and their eyebrows were twitching. And the first person to break the tense atmosphere was Barney.\n\"You will regret it, I'm certain. Didn't you see the chess match earlier? She's really smarter and more talented than anyone else. And yet, she's latching onto others' kindness, hiding her true identity, putting on a face that says she's powerless and can't do anything.\"\nHiding her true identity… those words made Monica gulped her saliva.\nIt was as Barney said. Monica has been hiding her identity as the Seven Sages. She's been lying to Lana.\nMonica cowered back, but Lana reached out and squeezed Monica's hand. Then instead of Monica, she turned her harsh eyes on Barney.\n\"Hey, why don't you be honest with me? …you're jealous of Monica, aren't you?\"\nAt Lana's remark, Barney's figure frozen for a moment.\nBarney's smile began to fade. And underneath the mask of the smile that had fallen off, what was revealed was… anger and hatred.\n\"I'm sure you'll learn it one day. How much of a difference between you and her, whether you like it or not.\"\n\"If my friend was outstanding, I would brag her to my father! I'd tell him how great my friend was, how proud I was of her! And yet, how can you be so narrow-minded?\"\n\"Ah, I guess ordinary people with no academic ability can't even feel a sense of frustration when the gap between them and geniuses is too wide!\"\nThe moment Barney finished his mocked words toward Lana, Monica had opened her mouth before she even thought about it.\n\"Barney!!\"\nLana and Bernie looked at Monica in surprise at her unusual loud voice. Still unable to think clearly, Monica continued to squeeze out her voice.\n\"Don't you dare say anything bad about my friend… or I won't be able to forgive you.\"\nBarney scoffed dauntingly at Monica's words.\n\"And what does it matter if you don't forgive me? Do you think your words are going to hurt me now?\"\nThe words he delivered were full of venom, but not with the same vigor as before. He was probably surprised at Monica who had never once talked back against him.\nAfter taking a long breath, Monica said the words she had been unable to say for a long time.\n\"…Barney, I know I've always relied on you, but abuse of it, I also wanted to be a great person that you could rely on…\"\nMonica had always asked Barney for his help. She hoped to become the kind of friend who could laugh at each other on equal terms someday.\n\"…I just wished you to acknowledge me as your friend… nothing more. And when I did great or worked hard, I didn't hope to be acknowledged by someone else, but you, Barney…\"\nBut it was an impossible dream. Maybe hoping for such a thing was already wrong from the beginning.\n\"But now, I'm giving up trying to get you to acknowledge me. I won't ask for anything from you again.\"\nMonica closed her eyes lids as if to cut off everything. And when she opened her eyelids again, the boy she once believed to be her best friend no longer reflected in her eyes again.\nOnce Monica turned her back on Barney, he reached out to her as if he wanted to say something to her. But Lana slapped his hand away mercilessly.\n\"A man who keeps attached after that is lame, you know that?\"\nLana dismissively said, intertwining her own arm with Monica's. While Barney simply stood there, without uttering a word.\nAfter a short walk side by side, Lana let out a satisfied snort.\n\"You did a good job of speaking your mind.\" Lana grinned, and Monica gave a small nod with a blush.\n\"Today I feel… a little stronger.\" Monica looked at her uniform and smiled, the corners of her lips curling up into a smile.\n\"Thanks to the corset, I feel my back more straight, and because of my makeup, when I felt like crying, I was able to hold back my tears because I knew if I cried, my makeup would fall off… it was all thanks to you, Lana!\"\n\"I promise to make you look more pretty than this.\"\nWhen Monica nodded her head, Lana smiled cheerfully and hugged Monica's arm tightly.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThe moment he heard Monica's statement, a crack appeared in Barney Jones' train of thought.\nTwo years ago, Barney thought he had achieved a sense of relief when he had cut off his friendship with Monica. Every time someone praised the [Silent Witch] of the Seven Sages, somewhere in the back of Barney's mind would have thought about these:\n—I was the one who had taken care of that girl.\n—I was the one who hurt her and trampled on that girl.\nThe sight of the genius girl, who had even been chosen as one of the Seven Sages, sobbing and begging for forgiveness from him brought him a certain wicked pleasure.\nBut Monica no longer wanted anything from Bernie. Not even expecting it. Monica had decided so and turned her back on Barney.\nThe way her back was leaving away was the opposite of what it had been two years ago.\nAt that time, it was Barney who left Monica behind. Now Barney was left behind.\nWrong, wrong, wrong.\nMonica needed to be more conscious of Barney. She should be more and more conscious and terrified of Barney.\n\"…this is not acceptable.\"\nBarney strode quickly down the hallway, looking for Pittman, the teacher in charge of Minerva.\nSince Pittman had said, \"I am not used at festive places,\" he did not show up at the banquet venue. So when Barney went to the waiting room, as expected, he found him there reading a book by himself.\n\"Mr. Pittman.\"\nPittman turned from his book and rounded his eyes at Barney, who stormed in as soon as he entered the waiting room.\n\"Oh, what's happened to you? You have such a scary look on your face.\"\n\"Please make me the front player for the next match.\"\n\"What? Wait, you can't just change it at the last minute… I'll get scolded if I do that!\"\n\"It should be possible with the signatures of the advisor and the teacher of the host school.\"\nWith that, Barney dragged a flustered Pittman to the staff room.\nNormally, it would be logical to ask Professor Boyd of Serendia Academy for his signature, but that would mean returning to the banquet venue where other Minerva students would be there. And he didn't have time to persuade them one by one.\nAny teacher's signature of Serendia Academy should do good enough.\nAs he opened the door to the staff room, he saw an old professor sitting there. He recognized that face. It was Professor McGreggan, who used to be a practical teacher at Minerva until a few years ago.\nGreat! Barney thought as he lifted the corner of his lips into a smile after considering how bad the sight of Professor McGreggan has.\n\"Prof. McGreggan, could you please sign this document?\"\n\"…hmm? Who are\nchuu\n?\"\n\"I'm a participant in a chess tournament. I urgently need a teacher's signature concerning the event venue.\"\nBarney arranged the appropriate lies and presented the documents to Prof. McGreggan.\nPittman, who had been dragged in halfway, asked, \"Do you know this old man?\" But Barney ignored him.\n\"A signature?. Sure, sure. Is this okay? Is not sticking out of the box, is it?\"\n\"Yes, it's perfect. Alright, let me submit this document to Mr. Boyd for you, Prof. McGreggan.\"\n\"Okay, oh, say hi to Mr. Boyd for me.\"\nHaving successfully obtained McGreggan's signature, Barney smirked. Now he can be the front player in the next match—he can have a match against Monica.\nI won't allow you to ignore me.\nWhatever the past or future, Monica Everett must be frightened and shriveled up by Barney Jones, ever.",

      "content": "After Lana had fixed her makeup, Monica returned to the match when she found a strange scene unfolding in the audience.\nAll the spectators sat on chairs prepared by the academy to watch the match, but with an exception of one person sitting on the floor.\nIt was Roberto Vinkel, the man who proposed engagement to Monica based on the chess premise and was promptly rejected. On his back was a piece of paper that said, \"I am reflecting.\"\nSandwiching Roberto's left and right sides were Felix with his smiling face and Cyril with his frowning face. In addition, sitting behind him, Redding, \"Temple\"‘s advisor, folded his arms while glaring at Roberto.\nAs Monica was taken aback by the unapproachable atmosphere, Roberto noticed her and raised his voice as he sat upright.\n\"Miss Monica, once this tournament is over, I'd like to continue discussing the previous matter——\"\nProf. Redding dropped a fist into his head at Roberto's stubborn attempt, then Felix and Cyril on either side added a cold remark to Roberto who was rubbing his beaten head.\n\"Vinkel, I believe I have not yet given you permission to speak.\"\n\"Any action that disturbs the participants before the match is strictly prohibited.\"\nThe atmosphere in Roberto's area was unusually chilly. Scary.\nLooking at the flustered Monica, Elliot and Benjamin beckoned her over. So she took advantage of this and quickly ran over to them.\n\"W-What happened to seat over there…\"\n\"Just pretend you don't see anything. And don't ask me what happened during your absence. Cause I didn't see anything. Okay, I will say it again. I didn't see anything.\"\n\"I had no idea the student council president who is famous for his gentle demeanor could be so ruthless… I certainly heard Georg Altmaier's Requiem, \"God's Wrath Shall Pour Down Here\" played in my mind that time!\"\nMonica didn't know what was going on, but what she did know for sure was something terrifying had happened. Deciding that it would be better for her not to know, Monica nodded her head in agreement with Elliot's advice.\nNone of the players from Minerva's side seemed to have arrived yet. Since neither the players nor their advisor teachers were in sight. But when the three people from the Serendia Academy side took their seats, the three people from the Minerva side showed up just in time.\nLeading the group was Barney Jones. She thought he would take the captain's seat… but contrary to her expectation, he walked right past Elliot and took the seat across from Monica. That action caused Elliot to raise one eyebrow and turned at Barney.\n\"Hey, aren't you sitting in the wrong seat? You're the captain, aren't you?\"\n\"We have just submitted a notice to change our role. So I'm pretty sure this should be\nmy\nseat.\"\nActually, Barney had been the captain of the team but changed his role to be the front player because he considered Monica to be a formidable opponent——which was considered as an insult to Elliot.\nElliot retracted his usual frivolous smile and directed his cold eyes at Barney.\n\"I think that was not a very smart move.\"\n\"I know it's disrespectful. However, there are some circumstances that I just can't give up.\"\nOther than Barney, the two people from Minerva's side looked somewhat confused as well. Perhaps the change of role was Barney's own decision.\nMonica was surprised, but not perturbed. Strangely, her mind was calm. Barney, who had been so scary to face, was now not scary at all.\nBarney took his gaze off Elliot and turned to look at Monica. His eyes were telling him this.\n——\"Look at me, be more conscious of me…\"\nHowever, Barney's obsession no longer reached Monica's heart.\nOnce Monica cast her eyes down to the board, nothing else occupied her mind anymore but chess. There's no room for Barney to get in.\n\"Let's have a good game.\"\n\"Let's have a good game.\"\nThe first move was made by Barney. Soon after, Monica made the next move.\nBarney played chess in a very aggressive manner. His style was filled with a strong will to win, regardless of how many pieces he had to sacrifice. Unfortunately, it was shattered head-on by Monica.\nBarney was supposed to be the captain so he would prove to be very strong. But, his playstyle was vulnerable. He will use anything to win, no matter how many sacrifices he had to.\nAs if all those sacrifices, moves, and strategies were in vain, Monica crushed Barney's moves one by one with precision. With the same ruthlessness with which she had once shot a wyvern between the eyes.\nMeanwhile, Claudia, in the spectator's seat, looked at the developments on the board and blurted out.\n\"She sure pretty ruthless…\"\nHow many people can make Claudia, who has a reputation for her ruthless with her words, say that person was ruthless?\nGlenn, who was not familiar with chess, asked Neil while looking at the live board.\n\"Uh, will Monica be able to win?\"\n\"It's not she won't able…\"\nNeil shook his head with a stern face.\n\"She's already won.\"\n\"Eh?\"\nGlenn widened his eyes and let out a silly voice. It was understandable that he was surprised. It had only been twenty minutes or so since the match had started.\n\"If Monica's already won, why is the match still going on?\"\n\"At this point, Miss Norton's victory is almost certain. However, her opponent is not willing to admit his defeat and keeps struggling…\"\n\"…He's desperate to bring the match to a stalemate. Since he would lose all his face if he lost in 20 minutes after had gone out of his way to lower himself to be the front player from the captain, so he's trying his best to buy time…\"\n\"Poor him…\"\nGlenn cast a pitying look at Barney. Next to him, Lana, who had been silent until now, folded her arms and snorted with pride.\n\"Yep, Monica's different today.\"\n\"… then how come you're the one who's so excited about it?\"\n\"Of course I will be excited since my friend was the one who wins the match. If it was me, I would be happy and proud if someone complimented me on something I like.\"\nLana lifted her slender chin as she said so, followed by a quiet declare of checkmate made by Monica.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"Checkmate.\"\nSo Monica declared, and at the same time, Barney was shaking violently and ruffling his bangs.\nMonica was looking at the board blankly. All she saw were the black and white pieces, completely oblivious to Barney.\nShe had always been like that. Always engrossed with magic, never paid any attention to Barney.\nActually, he had realized it. Monica was a real genius, and he was just an ordinary guy who was a little bit better than everybody else. And he knew that there was a solid wall he would never be able to overcome.\n\"Shit…\"\nWhen Barney stood up yanking on his chair and ran out of the venue, Monica did not chase him, nor did she call out to him. Even up until the last moment when Barney off out of the venue, her eyes were still fixed on the pieces on the board. That's what reality was.\nShit, shit, shit!\nBack in the waiting room, Barney slammed his fist against the wall. He knew what he did was not clever at all. Even so, he couldn't help looking for something to blame.\n\"…Umm, Jones…\"\nKnocking discreetly on the door, Pittman approached Barney. Apparently, he had followed him all the way from the venue.\n\"Look, I know it's frustrating to lose, but you can't keep staying here, you know. I mean, you need to greet other participants at the end of the match.\"\n\"…I'm sorry. I'll be back in a little while.\"\n\"Alright… But don't be too late, or that scary-looking teacher will stare at you…\"\nHe was probably referring to Boyd, the chess teacher at Serendia Academy, who had a scary face. Indeed, he had a feeling that that terrifying mercenary gaze would make him begging for life when it cast at him.\n…wait.\nBarney suddenly felt an odd discomfort.\nNo, he had been feeling it before, and it was not the first time—he hadn't noticed it because he was too busy worrying about his match, but this had happened before when he was in the staff room.\nOnce Barney suppressed his anger toward Monica, he turned to face Pittman.\n\"… Professor Pittman, may I ask you to teach me chess again when we return to Minerva?\"\n\"Well, sure, if it's okay with you.\"\nAt those words, Barney was convinced.\n\"…who are you?\"\nPittman rounded his eyes in disbelief at Barney's question.\n\"Eh? What do you mean by who? I am Eugene Pittman. The teacher of Minerva.\"\n\"Professor Pittman I know is an advisor for the Chess Club who's terrible at chess. He himself always said that there was nothing he could teach us because of how terrible he is.\"\n\"Well, there are times when I'd like to show off my skills in front of my students, you see.\"\n\"Then can you tell me what subjects do you teach? What is your specialty in magic?\nPittman fell silent as the questions came at him in a barrage.\nNow he was thinking about this, it felt strange.\nAs a former student of Minerva, there was no way Pittman didn't know McGreggan, who had been teaching practical spells at Minerva for years when they arrived at the staff room.\nAnd yet, that time he said this.\n—\"Do you know this old man?\"\nThe same was true regarding Professor Boyd. It was odd that Pittman, who has participated in the chess tournament as an advisor, forgot about his name.\n\"…I will ask you again, who are you?\"\nWhen Barney asked in a critical tone, Pittman's unreliable smile peeled away and his lips lifted in an arc.",

      "content": "Eugene Pittman was a professor who taught range magic in Minerva and was also the advisor to the Chess Club. With his mild personality, he was somewhat indecisive. The typical unreliable gentleman.\nBut that Pittman—or rather, the person who had been impersonating Pittman—was grinning, with his mouth curved up like a crescent moon.\n\"Wow, I guess Minerva's kids are really smart, huh?\"\nHis voice was distinctly different from that of Pittman. It was too low for a woman and too high-pitched for a man, almost sweet and sticky, like burnt honey simmered in a pot.\nThe person who took the appearance of Pittman grinned with a mouth like a crescent moon and lifted one hand to chant quickly.\nHe's a magician!\nWhen it comes to the magic battle, Barney, who can use shortened chanting, has the overwhelming advantage. But just as Barney began to chant a shortened spell, the fake Pittman was chanting as well as he lunged at Barney. His hand moved like holding a whip and struck Barney in the stomach.\n\"Gah…\"\nThe fake Pittman then pointed the tip of his finger at Barney, who winced as he held his stomach.\n\"\nBe bound, lightning chain\n.\"\nUpon completing the last verse of his chant, an electric shock shot out from the fake Pittman's fingertips. It bound Bernie's entire body like a chain, causing him a sharp pain all over his body.\n\"Guhaaaaa…\"\nUnable to bear the intense pain, Barney convulsed on the floor, wincing.\nThe fake Pittman put his hand over his mouth and chuckled.\n\"Oh dear, an assassin doesn't necessarily use magic as his only weapon, you know? Magic sure is useful, but not very efficient.\"\nAssassin. That one word was enough for Barney to understand the purpose of this man. Perhaps this man has switched places with Minerva's teacher and infiltrated Serendia Academy to assassinate an important person.\nAnd of all the important people, only one person who will always show up at this chess tournament came to mind.\n… his goal is to assassinate the second prince, Felix Ark Ridill.\nShould the second prince be assassinated, it would definitely destroy the political balance in the country. That alone must be prevented. More importantly, his pride would not allow this guy who talked like a fool to continue to beat him up.\nBarney silenced his voice and tried to do a shortened chant. However, the fake Pittman caught on immediately and stomped over his head. Which stopped Barney from chanting as his face slammed into the floor, and his glasses cracked and tumbled across the floor.\nHis nose and mouth are in pain, with some blood coming out of them.\n\"Don't you think magic is inconvenient? They are quite powerful when activated but the need of using chants each time used makes them inferior to simple violence like this. I do like guns, but they make a lot of noise, so they aren't really suitable for assassination.\"\nFollowing by twirling his fingertips, the fake Pittman chanted some line. It was a water spell.\n\"Death by drowning is awful, you know? The corpse is going to be soggy… just like this face I borrowed.\"\nBarney turned pale as he realized what he meant by those words.\nThe real Eugene Pittman had been drowned in this same water ball, unable to escape.\n\"You can't chant in the water… what better way to kill a sorcerer? Now, go die in a water cage, helpless and struggling.\"\nJust as the fake Pittman was about to swing his finger down, the door to the waiting room opened.\nA small figure could be seen behind the door, it was a frightened-looking Monica.\n\"…Barney!?\"\nMonica screamed at the sight of Barney lying on the floor covered in bruises.\nThe fake Pittman clicked his tongue and directed his fingertip where the water ball had been floating from Barney to Monica. It was impossible for the dull Monica to avoid it, which naturally, lead her to be trapped in the water ball helplessly.\n\"…It would be a problem if you start screaming. Unfortunately, you're going to die right there, little girl.\"\nInside the water ball, Monica was struggling, breathing air bubbles out of her mouth.\nThis water ball has \"a strong inward barrier\" which made it easy to enter but hard to escape. Once a person was trapped inside, it would be difficult for that person to escape.\nNo matter how skilled the magician was, without the ability to chant, there was nothing she could do but wait for death.\n—Right, if she was a magician who needed to chant.\nThere was a cracking sound like glass breaking. When the fake Pittman turned around, he was startled looking at the water ball barrier that trapped Monica had a crack, and now it was leaking out of water.\n\"How did you…!\"\nAs soon as the fake Pittman shouted, the barrier shattered completely, leaving Monica fell to the floor, with water spraying all over her. After coughed heavily, she then cast a spell without chanting.\nShe created an invisible mass of wind, then swung down over his head, slamming the fake Pittman's body down on the floor relentlessly.\n\"Guha… wha… how… who did…\"\nIn the state where his body was pressed down onto the floor, the fake Pittman was scanning his surroundings with bloodshot eyes.\nI see…\nLooking at the fake Pittman's behavior, Barney was secretly convinced. The fake Pittman hasn't realized that the wielder of this wind magic was Monica.\nAfter all, people believed that one cannot use magic without chanting, that much was common sense.\nAnd yet, the sole abnormal magician in the world who had ignored that common sense— and that abnormal [Silent Witch] was such a tiny girl, who could imagine that?\nWhen the thought of Monica was the user of the no-chant spell slipped off from his mind, what left for the fake Pittman was perhaps wary of the magicians lurking in his surrounding.\nMonica slightly raised her head to look at the fake Pittman. With just that gesture, she cast her next spell. It was an elementary electric shock spell. The power was not very high, but it was enough to render one person unconscious.\nThe fake Pittman jolted convulsively and stopped moving as his eyes went white.\nMonica let out a sigh of relief and slowly stood up to look at Barney.\n\"…Um, are you okay?\"\n\"It's nothing serious.\"\nActually, it hurt a little to the point of bringing tears to his eyes, but Barney held back his tears and rubbed the blood from his nose with his hand.\nWhile doing so, he picked up his glasses that had fallen to the floor. The lenses were cracked, but it was better than nothing. After putting them on his nose, he could see Monica's face looking at him worriedly.\nHe never thought that the day would come when he would be helped by Monica like this.\nAs he bit down on his bitterness, he heard a knocking sound coming from the window. A small yellow bird was perched on the window frame. When Monica opened the window, the little bird flew into the room, and the next moment, it transformed into a human form.\nThat figure looked familiar to him. He was a handsome man with golden hair and an out-of-place flamboyant formal dress. He was clearly not a human, but a high-ranking spirit.\n\"You've handled the assassin brilliantly, Miss [Silent Witch].\"\n\"… Lynn, this man may possibly be a diversion, so please keep an eye out for suspicious conversations elsewhere. Also, I want you to tell Nero to look out for any magical reactions in the surroundings for a while.\"\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\nAfter listening to the exchange between the spirit and Monica, Barney finally understood why Monica was enrolling in this school.\nIn the first place, with how shy Monica was, there was no way she would voluntarily enroll herself into Serendia Academy. She was probably on an escort mission for the second prince—a top-secret one at that. And that must be the reason why Monica was here, at this school.\nAfter transformed into a beautiful blond man, the spirit took out a rope of nowhere and tied up the fake Pittman.\nAs she watched, Monica glanced at Barney and opened her mouth.\n\"Barney…\"\n\"What is it?\"\nMonica smiled somewhat sadly when she heard Barney's blunt reply.\n\"…I think my fake school life will be over now.\"\nThe assassination attempt would surely be treated as a major incident. Since there have already been casualties of Minerva's people, they would be able to cover up this incident.\nConsidering Monica had captured the assassin, her true identity would soon be known. Then, she would no longer be able to stay at Serendia Academy.\nAfter taking all of that situation into an account, she heard footsteps from a distance. Perhaps someone had come to investigate the situation here.\nBarney who heard it, quickly spoke up.\n\"Make that spirit back into a bird. Hurry!\"\n\"Uh, eh…\"\nMonica was confused by his instructions, but the humanoid spirit beside her quickly reverted to its bird form.\nBarney hid the spirit which had turned into a bird. Almost at the same time, two people came into the waiting room.\nThey were Cyril Ashley and Neil Clay Maywood, the student council members of Serendia Academy.\n\"What the hell is going on?!\"\n\"A-A-Are you okay, Miss Norton? Your whole body is completely soaked!\"\nThe room was in such a chaotic situation, Pittman sprawled out with the whites of his eyes, Barney with an injured face, Monica completely soaked… no matter how one looked at it, it was totally not a normal situation.\nCyril removed his coat and put it over Monica, then asked Barney.\n\"Minerva's Captain Barney Jones. Explains the cause of that injuries.\"\nCyril looked at Barney with suspicion. Under these circumstances, he would suspect Barney had done harm to Pittman and Monica, which was not unreasonable.\nBut Barney answered calmly.\n\"I had suspected Eugene Pittman had been replaced by an assassin. When I discovered his true identity, he attempted to attack me but I was able to turn the tables on him. Miss Monica Norton was a victim who happened to be in the waiting room at that time…\"\nCyril and Neil's eyes widened in disbelief at Barney's confession. Barney looked down at the fake Pittman, adjusting his tilted glasses.\n\"This imposter may not be disguising but using whatever spells to change the body directly. He also said something that implied had murdered the real Eugene Pittman. We need to contact Minerva as soon as possible.\"\nSince the Ridill Kingdom forbade the use of spells that could change the body directly. The places where this assassin had obtained that technique to change his body could only be a few. And the first one that came to mind was:\n—The Eastern Empire, the only country that had lifted the ban on the use of medical spells applied to the body directly.\nNow the Empire had been involved, this matter has become a major incident.\nPerhaps sensing this, Cyril gave Neil instructions with a grim face.\n\"I'll keep the scene under control and have Bernie Jones elaborate for further details. General Affairs Manager Maywood, please report about this incident to His Highness.\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"Also, take Treasurer Norton to the infirmary. I'm sure some of her friends were among the spectators. Bring them with her.\"\nNeil nodded briskly and asked Monica, \"Can you stand up?\"\nMonica glanced at Barney, still covered with Cyril's coat.\n\"Barney… Um… Er…\"\nWhy did he keep quiet about the fact that she had defeated an assassin and was the [Silent Witch]—that's what Monica's eyes expressed.\nBarney smiled his usual fearless smile and muttered as he adjusted his tilted glasses with his fingertips.\n\"You better be grateful to me for the rest of your life.\"\nCyril and Neil looked dubious, unsure of the true meaning of these words.\nIn which Monica responded by bowing deeply to Barney before left the waiting room, accompanied by Neil.",

      "content": "The match between Serendia Academy and Minerva in the chess tournament resulted in a winner for Monica between the front players and a winner for Minerva between the middle players. With one win and one loss, the match between the two captains will settle the final winner.\nAlthough the match between captains was about to end, Lana was more concerned about Monica than the chess match.\nNot long after Barney Jones was defeated and ran out of the venue, Monica also left the venue. Probably chasing after him.\nLana was worried that Barney would lash out at Monica and say something awful to her again.\nBut since Cyril and Neil seemed to have gone to the waiting room to check on her, she thought it was unlikely, but some uneasiness still lingering in her mind.\nAfter a while, Neil returned with a hurried pace. He didn't walk back to his seat but went over to Felix to inform him about something.\n…he is not with Vice President Ashley?\nThe absence of Cyril and the sight of Neil's grim face made Lana even more anxious.\nAt that moment, the captains' match had come to an end. The winner was Elliot Howard. With two wins and one loss, the Serendia Academy side emerged as the winner.\nThere would be a short break after this, and then the matches between Temple and Minerva would take place, but…\nFelix stood up and said, \"I'm terribly sorry to interrupt when the match has just ended. Everyone, I have some information to announce\" in a loud volume, where the usually gentle and kind smile was missing from his face.\n\"I've just received a report that an intruder had infiltrated into this school.\"\nLana was taken aback by the unexpected announcement. The surprise was shared by everyone in the venue. Followed by the anxious feeling crept up in their mind.\nAs if to calm the apprehension, Felix softened the tone of his voice slightly.\n\"Please rest assured. We've already detained the intruder and have the guards standing by outside this venue. However, just to be safe, I'd ordered the guards to make a sweep of the school, so I hope everyone could stay here for a while.\"\nWhen Felix finished with his words, everyone was abuzz. Still, no one panicked, probably because they had been told that guards were standing outside.\nWait a minute. What about Monica? She's not in the venue right now!\nJust as Lana was about to speak up, a figure quietly approached their seats. It was Neil.\n\"May I have a moment?\" He beckoned to Lana, Claudia, and Glenn and whispered, \"I've been told Miss Norton was at the scene when the intruder was subdued.\"\n\"Wha—!?\"\nNeil quickly covered Glenn's mouth when he was about to scream. These days, Neil seemed to be getting better and better at covering Glenn's mouth. He then added, \"Shhhh,\" reminding him before continuing with his words.\n\"Fortunately, Miss Norton wasn't injured, but I imagine she's in shock, so… can you guys please stay by her side?\"\n\"Where's Monica right now?\"\nLana quickly inquired, and Neil replied in a whisper so that the others could not hear.\n\"She's in the infirmary.\"\nThus, at Neil's request, Lana, Claudia, and Glenn sneaked out of the venue and headed for the infirmary, escorted by guards.\n\"Monica, are you there?\"\nAfter knocking on the infirmary door, she peeked inside. Instead of the school nurse, she was confronted by the sight of Monica sat on a chair.\n——In her underwear, where she was wearing nothing but a male coat.\nLana quickly elbowed Glenn, pushing him out of the infirmary, and slammed the door shut, leaving Claudia and herself alone inside. She could hear Glenn's scream, \"That's mean!\" from the hallway, but that was not important right now.\nMonica didn't seem to feel anything in particular about being seen in her underwear by Glenn, as she only glanced up at Lana saying, \"Ah, Lana\" still sitting nonchalantly.\nLana approached Monica with large strides and asked in a quivering voice.\n\"…Monica, whose coat is that?\"\n\"Oh, this? Lord Cyril lent it to me…\"\nLana face-palmed with both hands and looked up at the ceiling.\n\"Vice President Ashley! I totally misjudged you! \"\n\"Eh? L-Lana…?\"\n\"What's more, how could he leave a girl dressed like this and go off somewhere? He's just horrible!\"\nLooking at how upset Lana was, Monica became flustered. While the calm Claudia, alone, looked at the wet uniform hanging in the corner of the room and seemingly had a general idea of what was happening.\n\"…I don't think that blockheaded man has the guts to leave a girl alone in this state.\"\n\"I mean! that's the only thing I can think of after looking at her appearances!\"\nAs Lana yelled in bloodshot eyes, Claudia pointed to a uniform hanging in the corner of the room. She was surprised when saw it when Monica spoke in a whisper.\n\"Well, um… I got my uniform soaked and it was cold, so I took it off to dry it off. But I didn't know how to take off the corset by myself… so I was glad when I saw you coming here…\"\n\"………….\"\nLana was silent for a while, but then she turned her head and looked at Monica with serious eyes.\n\"…You're not injured, are you?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Does anything hurt?\"\n\"Uh-uh.\"\nAfter Monica gave several curt nods, Lana crouched down and let out a heavy sigh of relief.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAfter Lana removed her corset, Monica took off her soaking wet underwear and changed into simple sleepwear in the infirmary.\nIn fact, she has been trembling in cold to had borrowed one of the thin blankets from the bed and wrap it over. Meanwhile, Claudia wordlessly offered her a tin mug which she had prepared to warm her body.\nMonica gratefully accepted and sipped the contents of the cup, then stiffened, stuck her tongue out.\n\"T-This is so spicy…\"\n\"…I mixed ginger, chili pepper, and citrus peel in it. It'll warm you up.\"\nIt was the kind mixture only focusing on how effective in warming the body while disregarding the taste itself, but as she sipped on it, her body began to warm up from the inside out.\nMonica heaved out her breath, and Glenn, who had finally been allowed to enter the room, asked.\n\"So, what exactly happened? I heard from the student council president that there's an intruder.\"\nMonica pondered over how much she should elaborate.\nApparently, word of the intruder had gotten out to the people in the venue. Even so, the extent of the information that Monica knew would sooner or later spread.\n…I think I should keep the matter of the assassin being disguised as Minerva's teacher to myself.\nThanks to Barney's quick thinking, Monica's status in that situation was that of a \"passing victim.\"\nThe assassin probably has no idea he was attacked by Monica's no-chant spell, so if Barney can get the word across, Monica can still continue to live in this school.\nBut, there was only one thing Monica didn't understand.\n…Why did Barney cover up for me?\nLooking at how much he had hated Monica. How he had ridiculed her for pretending to be a student, saying that was suited her very well. But in the end, he had made up a lie so as not to reveal Monica's true identity.\n——You better be grateful to me for the rest of your life.\nEver since I met you, I've been so grateful to you, Barney.\nI guess I can't really understand him\n, Monica thought with a sigh as she explained the situation.\n\"…Well, after I chased after Barney… I mean, Minerva's captain, to the waiting room, I found him in combat with the assassin…\"\n\"I see. So you got caught up in that battle, huh? Did your clothes get soaked because of water spells or something?\"\n\"Yeah, it was some kind of spell to confine the enemy with water ball…\"\nAs Monica explained how her uniform got soaked, Claudia stared at her with unreadable expressions.\n\"… Gotten involved in poison attempt at a tea party, caught up in the collapse of a piece of wood, and now encountering an assassin… what a fulfilling school life you have there. I think you should go to the church to see if you're cursed by something.\"\n\"Well…\"\nAside from the poison attempt at the tea party, the latter two were related to Felix's assassination. As his bodyguard, it was only natural for her to be present at the scene of the crime, but to the outsider, it would appear as if she had exceptionally bad luck.\nIn fact, she felt a little… no, a lot… or maybe, extremely unlucky.\nAs Monica was once again contemplating her bad luck, Glenn muttered as he was swinging his legs around ungracefully on his chair.\n\"Now Monica had just won the matches, but the chess tournament will be suspended?\"\nLana nodded at Glenn's comment.\n\"Surely, they will. Today's holiday, so the situation was not as bad as it seems, since not many students are coming to the school, but tomorrow will be much worse, I think.\"\n\"So the school festival will be suspended too after all?\"\nLana's face darkened at Glenn's grumbling.\n\"The school festival is only four days away. If this kind of incident happened four days before the festival, the annulment of the festival would be certain…\"\nLana, who was in charge of the costumes for the play in the school festival, seemed to be severely dejected. No wonder, everyone was looking forward to the festival. Glenn also looked disappointed and shrugged his shoulders, saying, \"I guess it will\".\nHowever, Claudia unexpectedly denied their concerns.\n\"…the school festival will go on as planned.\"\nShe did not speak to encourage Lana and Glenn. She only assured them that the festival would be carried out in her usual gloomy face as if she was speaking of a depressing fact. But Glenn and Lana rebutted dubiously.\n\"Even when the second prince assassination attempt just happened?\"\n\"I think they would cancel the festival for the sake of the prince's safety.\"\nWhat the two of them said was an obvious fact. However, Claudia explained to them reluctantly, as though doing it was too much troublesome.\n\"… Duke Crockford will definitely enforce the school to continue the festival.\"\nDuke Crockford—A great noble who was also Felix's maternal grandfather. He was the man who controlled Serendia Academy behind the scenes, and everyone knew that the school was under his control. But will Duke Crockford force the school festival to go on as planned, disregarding the safety of the second prince he has been protecting?\nSo Monica asked Claudia fearfully.\n\"Um, well… Duke Crockford is the backer of the Second Prince, isn't he? Then, shouldn't His Highness's safety be the top priority…\"\n\"… Duke Crockford is not that kind of man.\"\nMonica had never met Duke Crockford in person, so she knew only as much about him as she had heard from rumors.\nAccording to Louis Miller, he was \"a ruthlessly ambitious man who would stop at nothing to achieve his goals.\"\n\"I bet they will tighten the security. And because the school festival will be the second prince's debut appearance, the festival will be going on as planned. As a matter of fact, Duke Crockford will always prioritize the second prince's debut over his safety… So long as the second prince is his puppet, he would be unable to decline…\"\nThe second prince was Duke Crockford's puppet—that's what Casey had said. But for some reason, Monica couldn't help but feel that the word \"puppet\" didn't seem to fit for Felix.\nWith an unease feeling stirring in her chest, Monica sipped the contents of her cup. Hoping that the cause of her tingling spine was from the cold.",

      "content": "A young boy, who was the owner of this elegant room, mumbling uncomprehendingly as he was looking at the necklace on the table. Occasionally, he would glance back and forth between the grimoire and the necklace in his hands, before placing his small palm on the necklace and chanting the spell that was written in the grimoire.\n\"…What are you doing, Lord ******?\"\nThe servant boy, who had been silently watching his master, asked in an indifferent voice to keep his dismay at bay. And the boy who had been staring at the necklace turned his head and looked back, in return.\n\"The teacher from basic magic class today told me that a spirit has resided in the necklace I've got from my mother.\"\n\"Yes, I've heard Lady Irene has a good aptitude for magic and made a contract with a high-ranking spirit.\"\n\"Then, won't my grandfather would be pleased if I could do the same thing as my mother?\"\nThe boy's sky-blue eyes gleamed, leaving his servant in complete loss.\nOh, why is my master so dull-witted?—Hiding his thought, the servant quietly told him the cruel reality.\n\"I doubt your grandfather will be pleased.\"\n\"Eh?\"\n\"To contract a high-ranking spirit, you must have the same aptitude with the spirit you will make a contract with. But, Lord ******, you have different aptitude with the spirit Lady Irene had contracted with, so it can't be achieved.\"\nIn the first place, making a contract with a high-ranking spirit requires a huge amount of mana and the ability to understand magical formulas. The servant boy was inwardly exasperated, thinking why did he say that when he should have been taught this subject in his class.\nThe boy hung his head down dejectedly, staring down at the necklace. That sight made the servant let out a sigh inwardly. After all, he didn't want to make his master sad.\n\"Lord ******, could you give me a moment?\"\n\"…?\"\nThe servant flipped open his own jacket and pulled out a book that had been tucked on his back.\nGrownup people would have been able to sneak a book under his jacket, but the servant was a boy not much older than his master. So, the only way to bring in a book without the adults finding out was to hide it in his jacket, tying it to his body.\n\"Here, take this.\"\nThe boy's eyes lit up when he saw the title of the book the servant held out to him.\n\"It's an astronomy book by Mary Harvey, the [Star Oracle Witch]!\"\n\"I've been hearing you mention of wanting to read this book.\"\n\"Whoa! Thank you! I've been wanting to read that for ages!\"\nThe boy hugged the book to his chest and jumped in delight, expressing his joy with his whole body. Normally, he would scold his master for his ill-mannered behavior, but, only for this time, the servant boy feigned ignorance.\nThe boy—master of the servant boy—had taken an interest in the stars in the night sky. However, the grownups always tried to keep such books away from him, saying that astronomy was not necessary for his future. That was why the servant boy had secretly procured the book—only to please his master, nothing more.\n\"You know, the [Star Oracle Witch] is one of the Seven Sages, in fact, she's an amazing prophetess who can forecast the future of the country by watching the movement of the stars! It said there are many fortune tellers in this country, but the only person who's been titled as the \"prophetess\" was the [Star Oracle Witch]. Many said the color of the stars and the number of times they blink are important, considering that the color of the stars directly indicates the lifespan of the star…\"\n\"I regret to inform you but we should postpone this discussion until later. I believe the daughter of Marquis Shellbury should be arrived by now, so we should get ready.\"\nAt the servant boy's words, his master pouted.\n\"…now that reminds me, I promised Bridget to accompany her in dancing practice today…but I don't feel like doing it… You know how bad I was at dancing… Bridget also gets really mad when I step on her feet… Besides I'm not very good at talking to girls. I would be nervous when doing so, which makes it hard to speak properly.\"\n\"I don't think it's appropriate to say such a thing to your future fiancée.\"\n\"Of course, I won't dare to say that in public. I did so because it was you.\"\nThe boy took a deep breath jovially, hugging the book which he had received from the servant like a treasure.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThat night, the boy was summoned to his grandfather's room but stood stunned by the scene before him.\nKneeling at his grandfather's feet was the servant boy whom the boy looked up to like a brother. He was wearing nothing on his upper body, and his white back was severely swollen with whip marks from the chastisement.\n\"G-Grandfather… W-Why he…?\"\n\"I've got a report that this mongrel had brought you something unnecessary.\"\nMy grandfather then directed his gaze to a book on the table. It was a book that the servant boy had secretly procured for him. ‘How!? I've had it hidden in my room for sure!' thought the boy in shock.\n\"…I-I'm sorry, it was my fault. I was the one who forced him to bring that book…\"\n\"In other words, he's not following my orders, but yours…? How dare a servant like him mistakenly identify his master!\"\nWith that, his grandfather swung the whip down to the servant's back. The servant, who was not much older than a boy, gritted his teeth to endure the pain without uttering a single word.\n\"Please stop, I beg you, grandfather, please stop, I will never again ask for any more astronomy books. So please…\"\n\"Throw that book in the fireplace.\"\nAfter he was ordered by his grandfather, the boy picked up the book on the desk and stood in front of the fireplace. Then, with trembling hands, he tossed his precious book—which the servant boy had taken secretly only for the sake of pleasing his master—into the fireplace.\nTrying to hold back the tears as he watched the letters burning up, his grandfather revealed another his misconduct in a low voice.\n\"I heard today's dance lesson was a disaster.\"\n\"I-I'm sorry…\"\nThere was a sharp snapping sound as the whip was swung down again. But it was aimed not to the boy, but to the back of the kneeling servant boy, His grandfather knew all too well, it was more effective to hurt the servant whom the boy adored like a brother than to hurt the boy himself.\n\"You've brought shame upon me in the eyes of Marquis Shellbury.\"\n\"…I-I'm sorry, I'm sorry… I'll do it properly next time… I promise I won't embarrass you again. So, please…\"\nAfter pleading with tears in his eyes to stop whipping the servant, his grandfather delivered the whip for the last time with a single, loud snap. Even so, the servant boy did not scream and held on.\n\"There won't be next time.\"\n\"…Yes.\"\nAfter the boy nodded his head tremblingly, his grandfather cast a cold stare, more frigid than a winter lake, at his badly-behaved grandson and spat.\n\"To think such a failure is Irene's son, how deplorable.\"",

      "content": "Serendia Academy Principal felt his stomach churning like it never had before. Right now, his guest, Darius Knightley, the second most important person in this country after the king—or as people called him Duke Crockford—sitting across from him.\nAs the most powerful noble in the country, he has Serendia Academy covered in his influence. Not to mention, Felix Ark Ridill, the second prince of this country and Duke Crockford's grandson, was attending this very school.\nAt the chess tournament where the second prince had managed, an intruder was pretending to be a teacher from another school, which likely resulted in some criticisms for his inadequate security. Fortunately, the intruder was quickly apprehended and the second prince was not injured, but even so, Duke Crockford would not let that fact slip by.\nWhile holding back his shivering, the principal glanced at the sitting Duke Crockford across him.\nThe man with a little over sixty figure and his pale blond hair that had begun to turn into white has no resemblance to those old or worn-out people. In his younger days, his good looks alone had captured many noblewoman's hearts. Despite his age, he always had a sharpness like a blade that never rusted.\nHis bearing was strict and ruthless. Among the noble society, he was known for his shrewdness.\n\"I've heard the reports.\"\nThe moment the duke opened his mouth, the air in the room suddenly became heavier. As if having an invisible pressure on his back, the principal unconsciously tightened his grip on his stomach.\n\"Regarding the school festival…\"\nThe principal responded quickly to the duke's brief words.\n\"O-Of course, His Highness' safety is our top priority, so we would cancel…\"\n\"…it will be carried out as planned.\"\nThat was such short order, but the principal couldn't disobey. In front of this duke, he was not allowed to even questioning his reason. The principal knew, in the past, people who questioned the duke's orders were forced to be exiled from the kingdom.\n\"We will strengthen security, and carry out the school festival as planned!\"\n\"Good.\"\nJust as the Duke nodded, a knock resounded on the door of the guest room. The one who said, \"come in,\" was not the principal, but the duke. That very fact clearly showed who the ruler of this place was.\n\"Pardon my intrusion.\"\nFelix Ark Ridill—the duke's grandson, the second prince of this country—entered the room upon opening the door. He bowed his head to his grandfather with a hint of apology on his ever-so-gentle face.\n\"It's been a long time, grandfather. I deeply apologize for causing you so much worry.\"\nTo his sincere and apologetic grandson, the duke asked in a calm voice.\n\"How are you feeling?\"\n\"I am fine. It brings me so much pleasure when I heard hear of your arrival, grandfather. I am very grateful to you for coming here despite your busy schedule.\"\nWhen Felix politely expressed his gratitude, the duke nodded back silently.\nTheir exchange seemed casual, but the principal secretly felt relieved when knowing the duke had rushed to the academy for his grandson. It had been scary when the duke forced him to carry out the school festival as planned, but he was certain the duke had something in mind.\nIndeed. I bet His Excellency had been looking forward to seeing his precious grandson's debut! That's why he gave an order to proceed with the school festival!\nAs the principal was convincing himself this way, the duke turned his gaze at him.\n\"I need to talk with Felix for a moment.\"\nThe principal quickly stood up, understanding his unspoken intention to ask him to leave this room. Even if he was the principal of this school, if Duke Crockford told him to leave the room, he couldn't do anything but obey.\nAfter the principal left the room, Duke Crockford's calm face contorted slightly. In a distant manner, and in an abhorrent manner.\n\"You disgrace.\"\nFelix did not change his expression despite the harsh words spat out lowly. However, his gentle expression was no longer there, and his blue eyes, like glass beads that had lost their light, reflected the duke. Its appearance was exactly that of a lifeless puppet.\n\"You have neglected to take precautions against outsiders. That carelessness led to this incident.\"\n\"With all due respect, [Minerva] and [Temple] had a deep friendship for a long time with Serendia Academy. I believe it would be rude to be persistently cautious.\"\n\"Don't talk back to me.\"\nThe duke dismissed Felix's nonchalant rebuttal with a single word and told him brusquely.\n\"You must make the festival a success. I've invited all the major lords to the festival. Show them the dignity of Felix Ark Ridill, to be more precise, the authority of the Duke Crockford household.\"\nSoon, it will be time to determine the next king. And the current king will nominate one of his three sons to be his successor. For that reason, Felix had to make his presence known at this school festival. Understanding the duke's intentions, Felix quietly bowed and said in a voice devoid of emotion.\n\"…as you wish, Your Excellency.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nReturning to his room, Felix went straight to the closet, opened its door, and pulled out a new set of clothes. It was not the school's uniform, nor was it a glamorous outfit suitable for a second prince to wear. It was a subdued colored outfit that was devoid of ornate decorations.\nHe took off the uniform he had been wearing and draped it over the sofa, causing a white lizard to slip out of the pocket of his uniform. After landing on the floor, Will, the lizard, transformed into a young man in a servant's uniform.\n\"Your Highness, if you wear that outfit, don't tell me are you planning…\"\n\"It's been a while since I've had a chance to cut loose… can I?\"\nFelix smiled at Will's dismay. Most people would have nodded without a second thought if begged with that charming smile, but Will was resolved to give him some talk.\n\"There are only two days left until the school festival. After the chess tournament the other day, it would be best to refrain from playing at night until the festival is over…\"\n\"This is only my prediction, but I think Duke Crockford will give me some kind of role next time after he successfully presented me at the school festival.\"\nWhether it was diplomacy with other countries, a dragon-slaying mission, or even an engagement announcement. Felix predicted that once the duke made Felix's presence known to the lords at the school festival, the duke would do anything to create more glamorous topics in his discussion.\n\"I have hardly any free time left… will you help me, Willydean?\"\nWill looked at Felix with a sorrowful face and gave one small nod. Soon after, Will's figure blurred and dissolved into water. When the distortion regained its outline, it was not a young man in a squire's uniform, but a man with the exact same appearance as Felix.\nThis was the kind of illusion Will was best at. As a high-ranking spirit of water, Will may not be good at fighting or sensing threats, but when it comes to illusion, he has no equal. For this reason, the fact that Will can be his body double was very useful when Felix need to go out.\nNow, Will has the hair, the eyes, the skin color, the delicate and beautiful face, which was everything perfectly similar to Felix. The only difference was the somewhat sad expression on his face.\nFelix then quietly told his body double.\n\"This is probably my last time to cut loose.\"\nWill said nothing, only reflecting his sad face. A face just like his own was staring at him sadly. Looking at such a strange sight, Felix responded with a wry smile.\n\"I won't, of course, stray away from my true objective.\"\nFelix closed his eyes and then slowly opened them. Under his long golden eyelashes, a spark of determination shone eerily hidden deep within beautiful blue with a hint of green eyes.\n\"… \"I, Felix Ark Ridill… will do whatever it takes to etch this name down into the history.\" That vow has never wavered even now, in the past ten years. At least, let me enjoy my last time to cut loose, so whether to be his puppet, dog, or whatever it was, I'll let him whatever he wants me to be.\"",

      "content": "At night, two days before the upcoming school festival. Monica was invited to a luxurious mansion, in there, she sat squirming uncomfortably on the couch, attended by the handsome servant boys. While Louis Miller, the [Barrier Magician], crossed his legs arrogantly, after receiving a drink from the handsome servant boys.\nAcross from her sat a silver-haired charming beauty, who was also attended by a group of handsome servant boys as she sipped her glass of wine. She was the owner of the mansion, Mary Harvey, the [Star Oracle Witch], a Seven Sage who was similar to Monica and Louis.\nWith the charming innocent girl and the gracefulness of a mature woman, the [Star Oracle Witch] was a beautiful woman whose age was unknown. However, it has already been more than thirty years since she was appointed as the Seven Sages, making her the oldest of the current Seven Sages.\nThrough Louis, Monica has been invited to this mansion this morning.\nMary was eager to talk to Monica, but she was working on a top-secret mission outside her mountain cabin at the moment. Which the details could not be talked about. To hide this fact, instead of wearing the Serendia Academy uniform, Monica dressed in simple casual clothes and slipped out of the dormitory with the help of Louis to visit Mary's mansion.\n\"U-Um… I-I'm very grateful for invi, invi, invi, invite—\"\nWhen Monica uttered the words of greeting with a tense face, Mary giggled like a tinkling bell.\n\"Oh dear, you don't have to be so tense. Okay, how about a glass of Perle Dande red wine? You're already a fully grown adult, so you can drink wine, right? Maybe a light sip will help ease your tension~\"\nThe handsome servant boy quickly came to stand beside Monica with a bottle of wine in his hand, but Louis dismissed it with a wave of his hand.\n\"I would advise not doing so if you wish to have a proper conversation. Miss [Silent Witch] can be quite a handful when she is drunk… I once accidentally gave her some drink at my house and the result was a disaster.\"\n\"Uu…\"\nMonica clutched her chest at Louis' harsh words.\nIt happened when Monica was staying at Louis Miller's mansion in preparation for her mission to escort the second prince, and there, Monica accidentally drank some of Louis' treasured wine… what happened later was devastating. Though the rest was drunk by Louis himself.\n\"Aw, that's too bad~ Guess juice will do then.\"\n\"T-Thank you…\"\nMonica sipped the juice poured by the handsome servant boy and scanned the room.\nMary Harvey, the [Star Oracle Witch], was born from the Marquis family and had served the kingdom as one of the Seven Sages for many years, so it was quite fitting that her mansion was gorgeous and opulent. The windows were especially impressive. The glass used here was so luxurious that allows one to see the outside scenery clearly. It may have been made this way because she needed it for her \"prophecy,\" but it was extravagantly nonetheless.\n\"U-Um… S-So, what do you want to talk about?\"\nWhen Monica asked timidly, Mary sipped her glass and smiled softly.\n\"Oh please, there is nothing serious here. I just wanted to chat with you for the first time in a while~\"\nWith that, Mary moved her half-closed eye toward Louis and looked at him.\n\"Though I believe I didn't give you an invitation, I will permit it in consideration of your beautiful face, Louis. I do love beautiful things, after all.\"\n\"Hahaha, I am so flattered to hear that.\"\nLouis might have said he was flattered, but his manner said the otherwise. Which made Mary let out a sigh sadly.\n\"Such a pity. If only you were fifteen years younger, I would've made you my personal servant.\"\n\"Oh, how kind of you… Maybe you could expect me grown some beard in the next meeting.\"\n\"You're not cute!\"\n\"What do you expect from a grownup man to look cute?\"\nWhen Louis responded brusquely, Mary put a fan to her mouth with a sorrowful look on her face and said, \"This's why I don't prefer grownup men…\".\nBoth Mary and Louis have rather stubborn personalities, but they were unquestionably beautiful. Watching them chatting and laughing while being served by handsome boys was quite a sight to behold.\nIt made her wonder why she had been invited here. She was the only one who didn't fit in this place. Even the servants would find it hard to relate Monica to the Seven Sages like Louis and Mary.\nAs Monica fidgeted with her glass, clutching it with both hands, Mary gave Monica a friendly smile.\n\"I'm actually happy to have you around, Monica. We are the only girls among the Seven Sages, aren't we? So I want to get to know you better.\"\n\"R-Right…\"\nMonica gave a vague response, and Louis was about to say something but held back.\nHe probably wanted to say something like, \"Isn't it too much to call yourself a ‘girl' at your age?\" Even so, he showed her some consideration to the extent that he swallowed those words.\nAfter all, Mary Harvey was presumably the oldest of the Seven Sages and the only one in the kingdom who was dubbed as the \"prophetess\".\nThe Seven Sages had their own specialties in magic which was stood above among the other magicians. Just as Monica was skilled in no-chant spells and Louis in barriers spells, Mary Harvey, the [Star Oracle Witch], was skilled in astrology.\nIt was relatively uncommon for people to study astrology, but Mary's astrological accuracy was unsurpassed among them. Moreover, the king trusted her immensely and dubbed her \"the prophetess\". At the meeting of the Seven Sages, she was the one who mainly presided over it.\nMonica suddenly had a thought. Could Mary want to reprimand Monica in a roundabout way for the fact that she kept skipping the Seven Sages' meeting?\nAfter all, it had been almost two years since Monica had been appointed as the Seven Sages. And her attendance in the meetings held every month or two can be counted in one hand.\n\"Um… I-I'm sorry I have been skipping the meetings lately…\"\nMonica made the first move and apologized, and Mary smiled broadly.\n\"No need to apologize. In fact, it's always ended up with Louis and the [Jewel Magician] exchanging sarcastic remarks, while the [Thorns Witch] happily eating vegetables, and the [Cannon Magician] snoring in his seat. Just for your information, the [Abyss Shaman] attendance rate is less than half of yours.\"\nThis fact alone almost made the image of the Seven Sages shattered into a million pieces.\n\"You don't have to be so nervous, even I would say you're the most diligent person among the Seven Sages. Right, the other day, thank you for helping me calculate the observation records for my students~ Really, you've been a life saver~\"\nWhen she was holed up in the mountain cabin, Monica took on the task of calculating the star orbit observed by the astronomers who were Mary Harvey's students. It was one of the most difficult tasks that Monica had ever taken.\nIt was such a challenging job for her, so Monica remembered it well.\n\"If I recall correctly, it was a decade-long record of a single star… right? I've recalculated it several times, after all. What happened to that star now?\"\nMary can predict the future of a country or a person by the color of the star, the number of times it blinks, its orbit, and its distance from other stars.\nWhat Monica can do is calculate the results of the observations, but she has no idea whose fate is implied by the results. So she simply calculated the orbit from the observation results and provided the results to Mary.\nHowever, she knew one thing: Mary had been sensing a strange movement of a certain star for about ten years.\n\"Incidentally… whose star is that you've been want to foresee about, Lady [Star Oracle Witch]?\"\n\"It was the second prince's, His Highness Felix Ark Ridill's star.\"\nMonica gulped involuntarily while Louis' eyebrows twitched just a little without changing his expression.\nPerhaps noticing their reaction, Mary put her hand on her cheek and let out a sigh of depression\n\"I've been foreseen many futures of the kingdom, especially on the royal family… but for the past ten years, I've been unable to read His Highness Felix's destiny.\"\nAt Mary's words, Monica's heart stirred quietly.\nMary's star oracle was not all-powerful, and she herself was well aware not everything can be foreseen.\nStill, the fact that she was unable to read Felix's destiny at this moment gave Monica a strange feeling of uneasiness.\nAn assassination attempt by Casey, an intruder at a chess tournament… Amidst all the disturbing things happening, the school festival was approaching in two days.\n…I have a bad feeling about this.\nAs Monica held her chest and cast her head down, Mary leaned forward to peek at Monica's face.\nOn the surface of Mary's somewhat unfocused light blue eyes, Monica's figure was reflected there.\n\"Um… Lady [Star Oracle Witch]?\"\n\"Why look so gloomy? Alright, as thanks for helping me with my work, how about I foresee your destiny a little bit?\"\nMary rose slowly to her feet and stood at the window, dragging a thin silk robe with her. She then looked up at the stars in the night sky with her clear eyes—then declared Monica's destiny she foresaw.\n\"I can foresee your love life is on a roll right now! Moreover, you might end up spending a passionate night with a nice gentleman~☆\"\nMonica hung her head, looking like she was about to throw up, and covered her face with her hands.\n\"…I-It's still too early for meee!\"\nJust a few days ago, she had received a proposal of engagement based on chess. While Louis was,\nthat's a bit too crude for a prophecy from the Seven Sage\n, muttered in amazement.",

      "content": "Mary Harvey, the [Star Oracle Witch], suggested Monica for staying over, but considering tomorrow was the day before the school festival, she declined politely. In fact, no classes would be held on that day. However, student council members and students who were going to perform need to show up in order to prepare for the festival. For that reason, Monica also had to show up once before noon.\nAfter walking away from Mary's mansion for a while, a little yellow bird flew down from the sky. It spun around above her spot, then immediately transformed into a beautiful woman in a maid's uniform. It was Lynn, Louis' contracted spirit.\n\"Have you enjoyed your drink feast?\"\nLouis's brow wrinkled deeply at Lynn's remark.\n\"…Don't speak those words when in front of my wife.\"\nHe felt guilty when remembering his wife was pregnant at home but he had indulged in a drinking spree. To which, Lynn affirmed in response.\n\"Understood, I will tell Madam that Sir Louis was having a drinking spree accompanied by handsome boys.\"\n\"… looks like your mouth needs to be disciplined. But before that, I have a task for you. Take Miss [Silent Witch] back to Serendia Academy.\"\nLouis can travel fast with his flight spell, but Monica can barely use it yet, except for leaping.\nIt would take a horse-drawn carriage half a day to get from Mary's mansion to Serendia Academy, but with the use of flight spell, it can be done in no time at all.\nI guess I really should practice my flight spell…\nWhile Monica was pondering these thoughts, Louis continued as he re-buttoned his coat.\n\"I also have a slight concern when the [Star Oracle Witch] told us the second prince's fate can't be predicted.\"\n\"Right…\"\n\"As for the intruder at the chess tournament, I have instructed my men to send him to the capital shortly. That way, I can use all my hands to make him reveal the mastermind. I also have some doubt about that intruder identity.\"\nLouis creaked his gloved fingers afterward.\nMonica knew, his hands which were finely shaped and refined like those of nobles had splendid calluses for punching. She secretly felt sorry for the intruder who was about to be interrogated by him.\n\"My colleague, please keep your vigilant during the school festival. Just in case, I'll lend you this useless maid. Use her as you fit.\"\n\"Miss [Silent Witch], you can leave the task of assisting to this excellent maid, Lindbergfield.\"\nIn response to Louis's sarcasm, Lynn introduced herself like that of the head maid without changing her color. Her thick face was something Monica would like to learn.\nLouis glanced at his brazen contract spirit and gave a small cough.\n\"Also, I will be there on the day of the festival. While I do have another task to do… I'll try my best to help you with the escort.\"\nHaving Lynn, who can oversee a wide area, and Louis, who was skilled in the barriers, could not be more reassuring than this.\nMonica bowed to Louis and said, \"I'll be glad if you can help me\" but Lynn blurted out.\n\"…Shouldn't it have been Sir Louis who need to bow to ask for help?\"\nWith his smile remaining on his face, Louis wordlessly kicked Lynn in the leg.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nLynn's flight spell was a little different from that used by human magicians.\nUnlike ordinary flight magic, where the magician wrapped a thin membrane-like barrier on his body to fly, in Lynn's case, she created a hemispherical barrier around herself to bring everyone within it. It may sound easy, but it's impossible for a human's mana to maintain a hemispherical barrier while traveling at high speed for a long period of time. That's probably why Louis, despite swearing a lot, valued Lynn's abilities.\nIt had been 30 minutes since they had been flying in the sky. After scanning the ground below, Lynn then spoke.\n\"We will be arriving at Serendia Academy shortly.\"\n\"Oh… incredible, that was fast…\"\n\"I do provide some landing methods you can choose. To be more specific, I have the \"Tornado Kick Landing Method\", the \"Head Spin Landing Method\", and the \"Grand Wheeled Method\". The main point is, I've made some modifications in the shape of the barrier to make it easier to spin.\"\nWas the method Lynn and Louis previously used when landing the old garden included among them? All of them were nothing but worrisome, so Monica quickly said.\n\"U-Use the safest landing method, please!\"\n\"As you wish. Proceeding to decrease our speed… hmm?\"\nLynn, who had been looking at the ground, tilted her head ninety degrees to the side with a snap. Her creepy reaction, like a doll with a broken head, was a sign that she was expressing her puzzling behavior in her own way.\n\"… I have detected a suspicious carriage parked near the Serendia Academy boys' dormitory.\"\n\"Eh?\"\n\"Shall we land in a spot nearby, so we can scout out the carriage?\"\nLynn's flight magic worked by moving hemispherical barrier, so it's not suitable for scouting through wooded areas, since it would collide with the trees and make a loud noise. As such, she needed some open space for her to have a quiet landing.\nMonica pondered for a moment before giving Lynn some instruction.\n\"…I'm planning to use \"Farsight\", so can you maintain your barrier in a fixed position?\"\n\"Certainly.\"\nThe \"Farsight\" spell works the same way as using a telescope. So when using it while moving or something obstructed her view, that would make it harder for her to see the object.\nAfter having Lynn fixed her flight spell in still, Monica activated \"Farsight\" without chanting.\nThe carriage, which parked secretly near the boys' dormitory, was a small carriage with two-wheeled and few ornaments, a plain one. But Monica soon realized that it was protected by high-level magic tools.\nThe whole carriage has a simple protective barrier and a soundproof barrier… it's likely using some kind of engineering in the wheel to suppress vibration… perhaps it's for a noble traveling in secret?\nShe can't see the coachman's face clearly since his head was covered in a hat with his face hidden by a scarf. Is there someone inside the carriage?\nAfter carefully looking at the carriage, Monica noticed someone sneaking out of the boys' dormitory and approaching the carriage. It was a rather tall man wearing a hooded cloak with black hair peeking out from between the hoods.\nRealized, Monica exclaimed in surprise.\nEven he changed his hair color, she could still see the golden ratio of his body! It was impossible for her to mistake him for someone else.\n\"H-His… His Highness!?\"\nWithout a doubt, it was Felix who had slipped out of the boys' dormitory. After which he got into the carriage then closed the door before letting the carriage travel quietly.\n\"That direction is heading to the entertainment district. Is he having a secret night out?\"\n\"Wha, Wha, What do we do!?\"\nMonica flustered as she held her head with both hands. Originally, she should have stopped Felix, but the carriage had already left.\nMonica was Felix's bodyguard. She can't just let him go like this.\n\"I feel bad for Nero, who's staying at the dormitory, but… Lynn, please continue following that carriage.\"\n\"Understood.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAs Lynn mentioned, the carriage carrying Felix stopped in the town near Serendia Academy where the entertainment district was. Once they were inside the city, it would be difficult to follow him with flight magic. So Monica asked Lynn to land quietly with the safest method and followed Felix on foot afterward.\nInstead of letting Lynn remain in human form, Monica requested Lynn to transform herself into a little bird and have her hide inside the cloak. The humanoid Lynn stands out whether she is a man or a woman, after all. Afterward, Monica pulled her hood up tightly over her eyes and cautiously followed Felix's back.\nThe entertainment district was surprisingly bright at night, where sketchy stalls lined up at every end of the street, along with touts and flamboyantly dressed women calling out to passersby.\nThe reason why there were so many people here even though it was nighttime was probably related to local nobles who were staying in the town near the Serendia Academy to participate in the school festival. The touts were busy calling out to these wealthy guests, never paying attention to Monica. It was not surprising if one considering her plain appearance. They probably saw Monica as nothing more than a maid on an errand.\nAfter getting off the carriage, Felix took off the hooded cloak he was wearing when he sneaked out of the boys' dormitory, replaced it with a stylish frock coat and hat, and strolled proudly through the night streets.\nHe strolled over through the stalls, waved one hand back at a smiling prostitute who threw a kiss at him while casually dismissed the touts. Rather than of a young man unaccustomed to the nightlife or a nobleman who had just come from the countryside, his behavior was more like someone who was used to hanging out like this.\nI've seen him sneaking out before, but… well, I guess this proved that he's used to hanging out like this.\nIn this regard, she was not particularly disillusioned or disappointed, let alone harbored the image of the perfect prince, so whether she saw Felix spent his nights out or played with women, she couldn't care less.\nShe just found it surprising. Felix has always had a calm and friendly demeanor, but at the same time, very careful and a perfectionist. This can be clearly seen in the way he has conducted himself in the student council. Now that Felix was doing something like this had made Monica feel him strangely out of place.\nAt any rate, I need to escort His Highness back to the dormitory safely…\nPerhaps it was because of these thoughts, it had made her looked away for a moment, letting her lost sight of Felix's back.\n\"Ah…\"\nMonica panicked and ran off from her spot. She searched the crowd for the figure of a young man with dark hair, wearing a stylish coat and hat, but she could not find him.\n\"I'm sorry, Lynn. I lost him…\"\n\"I'll search from above. Please wait a moment.\"\nFrom within Monica's cloak, Lynn, in the form of a small bird, flew out and soared into the sky. It would be best to stay quiet until Lynn found him, so she decided to move over to the side of the street quietly. But then, someone tapped her on the shoulder.\n\"Excuse me, young lady, I wouldn't recommend hanging out at night without a companion.\"\nMonica turned around at the familiar voice and saw Felix standing there.\nHowever, his hat and coat, which Monica had been using as a mark, had been taken off and held in his arm. Looking at Monica who was opening and closing her mouth, Felix put his coat back on, wearing the face of a child who had succeeded in his mischief.\n\"Most amateurs in tailgating like to use things their targets wear as markers. Just take off the hat and coat, they'll be fooled in no time.\"\nThe black hair, which was a different color than usual, was likely to be a wig. Felix dexterously put his hat back on while holding it with his fingertips to prevent the wig from slipping off.\n\"Now, care to tell me why you are here? Are you having a secret date perhaps?\"\n\"U-Uh, well, i-it's not a secret date, but, uh, I saw you, Your Highness, and I was curious, so I followed you…\"\n\"I believe this place is quite far from there if you considering the distance. So, how did you manage to catch up with me?\"\nThere was no way Monica could say that she was following him from the sky using a flight spell.\nMonica's eyes whirled in circles, her mind racing to come up with an unfamiliar excuse. And, after using the most brilliant mind of the country's foremost magician, the [Silent Witch] of the Seven Sages to the full-throttle, the result was:\n\"T-The truth is, I am a bad girl, so i-it's normal if I'm here hanging out at night! And then, I accidentally spotted you, Your Highness…\"\nFelix was completely blank and silent for a few seconds. The next moment, he released his breath and laughed in trembling.\n\"A bad girl…? you are…? …pfft, haha. I see, I guess we both are a bad boy and a bad girl, then.\"\n\"R-Right. A bad boy and a bad girl.\"\n\"Here's a suggestion. Since we both are bad people, why don't we hanging out together for a night out? It would be as twice as fun when you have someone to enjoy it with.\"\nFor Monica, this proposal was something she could not have wished for. This way, she would be able to guard Felix without reservation.\n\"O-Okay. L-Let's have fun together.\"\nHer way of bowing her head was contradicted with the behavior of someone who called herself a bad girl, but Felix was shaking really hard, suppressing his laughter.\n\"You really never cease to surprise me. I never thought I'd have someone to accompany me on my last break.\"\n\"?\"\nMonica looked up at Felix's face quizzically, but Felix gave her a somewhat mischievous smile different from his usually calm face. And yet, the smile he gave while letting the corners of his eyes slightly lowered, exuded a kind of seductive charm unlike what he had during the day.\nFelix put his finger on Monica's cheek and leaned closer to examine her face.\n\"Here, you should refer to me as Eig… okay?\"\n\"L-Lord Eig.\"\nCould it be a derivation of Felix's middle name, \"Ark\"?\n\"Lord Eig, Lord Eig,\" said Monica, rolling the unfamiliar name around on her tongue, to which Felix pressed his index finger against her lips.\n\"Not Lord Eig, but just Eig. We're fellow bad people, remember?\"\n\"B-But…\"\nFelix laughed at Monica's bafflement, showing his white teeth, holding out his hand to her. Like he was having fun so much.\n\"Let's go, Monica. Time flies very fast when the sun goes down. So, how about we enjoy ourselves tonight to have some fun together.\"",

      "content": "[\"Miss [Silent Monica], can you hear me?\"]\nMonica, who's been walking alongside Felix, heard Lynn's voice out of nowhere. She looked around in alarm, but Felix and the other passersby didn't seem to notice.\n[\"Can you hear me? I am now speaking directly to your eardrums…\"]\nApparently, Lynn could speak directly to Monica's eardrums through vibration. It looked simple but was a highly advanced technique. At the very least, it's not something a human being can do.\n[\"I've confirmed that Miss [Silent Witch] has successfully met up with the Second Prince. I will be guarding the two of you in the air. If everything is all right, please raise your right hand.\"]\nMonica raised her right hand, pretending to fix the rim of her hood, and found a small yellow bird on the roof of the store ahead.\n[\"I may not be able to enter the building, but I can hear most of the conversations. If there's an emergency, please do not hesitate to summon me.\"]\nAlthough Monica appreciated Lynn's support, one wrong move and she might break in as a man in a flamboyant costume, just like last time. She was making a mental note to keep Lynn's help as a last resort if possible when Felix tapped Monica on the shoulder.\n\"By the way, Monica, what kind of places do you usually hang out at?\"\n\"…eh?!\"\nFelix laughed in a somewhat meaner way than usual.\nMonica broke out in a lazy cold sweat, desperately trying to figure out what a night out is all about. As a person who basically never went out through the days facing the numbers and magic formulas, the word \"hanging out\" was unknown territory. Much less a night out. What is she supposed to do when she goes out at night?\n\"As bad girl, you should be used to the nights out, right? Can you tell me what kind of places do you usually go to?\"\n\"W-Well… that's…\"\nMonica, who had been groaning, suddenly had an idea.\nThat's right, she had just experienced the \"night out\"! Moreover, it was the kind of experience that ordinary people can't afford. This must be the exemplary answer to a night out. Her eyes lit up like when she found the solution to a difficult mathematical equation, so she answered confidently.\n\"Having a drinking feast accompanied by handsome boys!\"\nFelix burst into a hearty laugh. Furthermore, there were tears welling up in the corners of his eyes. He wiped away his tears of laughter as Monica was stunned by his attitude, which was unthinkable from the usual Felix.\n\"If you prefer that kind of thing, I can take you to a nice place like that.\"\n\"No, I've had my fill of that sort of thing, so…\"\nIn fact, just a few minutes ago, she had been attended by a beautiful boy at the [Star Oracle Witch]'s mansion.\n\"Your… I mean Lord Eig…I don't mind if you choose the place…\"\n\"It's Eig.\"\n\"T-Then, E-Eig, I don't mind if you choose the place.\"\nResponding meekly, Monica let out a small sneeze and shuddered. The blowing wind in the autumn where the winter was reaching can be so cold. Some of the people on the street were already wearing fur coats.\nAs Monica rubbed her numb fingers together, Felix wrapped his hand around hers and blew a breath of air. The white cloudy breath softly floated then disappearing as if it were melting to the dark night.\nMonica tilted her head.\n\"Um… I think breathing on my hands won't make any difference…\"\n\"Then, how about this?\"\nFelix loosened his scarf slightly and grabbed Monica's hand to touch his own neck.\nMonica's small hand touched Felix's slender, white neck. The warmth of human skin spread slowly into Monica's numb fingertips. The comfort feeling made her mouth loosened… then she remembered the ridiculous reality that she had her hand touched Felix's neck before jumping away.\n\"Aaaaah, um, well, in times like this, if you open and close your hands, the blood will circulate and wa-wa-wa-warm your fingers.\"\n\"If you had to repeat your words like that… I guess it has to be very warm.\"\nFelix chuckled as he removed the warm scarf and wrapped it around Monica's neck.\n\"Before that, I guess we should find you some warm clothes first. Follow me.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nFelix brought her to the most gorgeous two-story building in the entertainment district. Upon entering the gorgeously decorated entrance, she was greeted by the intriguing scent of flowers in an opulent vase, mixed with the smell of incense.\nAlthough he said he was looking for winter clothes, she assumed he was going to a clothing store, but it was pretty obvious to everyone that this place did not sell clothes. It was a store that offered an exciting time with beautifully dressed ladies.\n\"This, This, This, This, This…\"\n\"Are you craving some fish?\"\nMonica shook her head as she struggled to speak.\n\"I-I mean, w-what kind of place is this…\"\n\"The House of Madame Cassandra.\"\nSo Felix replied, and then a woman stepped out from the back of the store. She was dressed boldly, her amber hair in a loose updo, exposing her shoulders and chest. She giggled like a cat who's found a prize, nibbled on the base of Felix's neck, and kissed him passionately on the cheek.\n\"Sir Baron! I haven't seen you in a long time. You haven't shown up at all lately, I missed you so much.\"\n\"Hi, Doris. Sorry I've been so busy lately.\"\n\"Hey, why don't you pick me tonight? Since you're here, I'll turn down all other reservations for tonight.\"\nThe woman called Doris whispered in a tempting voice, to which Felix returned a kiss on Doris' cheek and said.\n\"Sorry, I have some business with Madame Cassandra.\"\n\"That's a shame.\"\nDoris seemed to finally notice Monica's presence there, and with her body still entwined with Felix's, she turned her head to look at Monica. There was no malice in her gaze, simply to be genuinely assessing Monica's value.\n\"Hmmm… for a woman he brought, she doesn't look like she's going to get many customers…\" muttered Doris before turning her gaze back to Felix.\n\"Whatever. Oh, right, Madame Cassandra's in the back room. This way, this way.\"\nDoris wrapped her own arms around Felix's left arm and started walking. Then found Monica still confused there, so she yelled at her in exasperation.\n\"Come on, what are you standing there for? Look, his right arm is free right now.\"\n\"…eh?\"\nDoris beckoned Monica to stand on the right side of Felix. She then grabbed Monica's hand and forcibly entangled it in Felix's right arm, while she herself clung back to his left arm.\n\"This is how you entwine your arms! Press your chest against his body more… and, uh… well, maybe you don't have any chest to press against.\"\n\"…………\"\nWhat am I being forced to do? thought Monica before turning her gaze to Felix with a troubled look on her face, only to find him trying hard to hold his laughter.\n\"U-Um…\"\n\"I guess I should introduce you to the madam first.\"\n\"R-Right…\" Monica replied vaguely and started walking with her arm entwined in Felix's… or more like holding his hand like a lost child.\nThe house of Madame Cassandra was one of the most popular establishments in this entertainment district, and whether it was the decorations on the pillars, doors, or the carpets, the whole place was so gorgeous it hurt her eyes.\nThe mansion of Mary Harvey, the [Star Oracle Witch], was also luxurious but compared to this store, hers was much more elegant, Monica thought to herself.\nEventually, Doris stopped in front of a room at the end of the corridor.\n\"Madaaaame! Madame Cassandra! I brought you a good man after a long time, he's coming to see you!\"\n\"Come in.\"\nThe voice coming from inside the room was that of a woman who had been drunk.\nDoris opened the door in a good mood and let Felix and Monica in.\nThough the corridor leading up to this place was quite gorgeous, the inside of that room was even more painful to the eyes.\nCarpets in red tones, curtains made of velvet, the decorations and tassels, which had been crafted with a lot of goldwork and gold thread. And in the center of the room, a woman was sitting on a cat-legged couch. She, with beautifully coiffed gray hair, bright scarlet dress, and wide-brimmed hat, was already past her prime age, but far too vibrant to be considered old. Her amber eyes, glistening with a strong glow, were reflecting Felix's.\n\"Oh, my, Sir Baron. It's been a while since I've seen you. You know, the girls in the store have been losing motivation because you haven't been showing up lately.\"\n\"I apologize for that, Madam. A few things have come up in my business.\"\nWhat kind of a business does he have, he's just a student. However, looking at Felix now, no one would think that he was a student. He was far too used to the nightlife.\n…I'd better not say something unnecessary…\nWhen Monica took a step back and hid behind Felix, the woman known as Madame Cassandra cocked her chin and looked at Monica.\n\"Who's that girl?\"\n\"Oh, I was wondering if you could take care of her clothes. I want her looking more appropriate in this city.\"\nThis proved he was not lying when he told her that he was looking for warm clothes for Monica. Regular clothing stores would have long since closed by now. So, he figured it would be quicker to get some clothes and pay for them at this kind of store.\nDoris said, \"In that case, leave it to me,\" in response and grabbed Monica's wrist.\n\"Come on, this way!\"\n\"But, I…\"\nMonica looked at Felix and Doris alternately in dismay, but Felix just smiled and waved at her.\n\"Have her get dressed beautifully.\"\n\"W-Wait, I…\"\n\"Come on, get moving!\"\nDoris grabbed the flustered Monica's wrist and started walking with a big stride, half dragged to another room.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAfter watching Monica being dragged away by Doris, Felix sat down on the couch across from Madame Cassandra, which she then opened a locked drawer of her cabinet, took out a few envelopes from it, and placed them before him afterward.\n\"Baron Grimton, Count Morin, Count Aschente, Marquis Bardia… it was from the nobles you met in this store.\"\n\"Thanks for all your help as always, Madam.\"\nFelix thanked her, took the envelopes, and put them in his pocket without checking the contents. The nobles that Madame Cassandra mentioned had one thing in common. They are all nobles affiliated with Duke Crockford. Of course, the perceptive Madame Cassandra must have been aware of this.\n\"I don't mean to pry too deeply, but… are you going to stop coming to this store?\"\n\"I afraid so.\"\nFelix placed a bag of gold coins in front of Madame Cassandra, who sighed, \"My precious guest\" in response.\n\"This should be enough for you to have a big party tonight.\"\n\"And of course you're going to be at that party, aren't you?\"\n\"No, I've got other places to go. If you could just lend me a place to sleep tonight, that would be enough.\"\nMadame Cassandra, with a sullen look on her face, took out a smoking pipe and sucked the tip of it into her bright red lips.\n\"For the last time. You can bring in as many girls from my store as you like to your room.\"\n\"That might not be a bad idea, though. On my way here, I made a night-out friend, albeit in an unexpected way, so I'd planning to take her as my priority today.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nMadame Cassandra widened her eyes, which had been squinting moodily, and blinked.\n\"…could it be that the dull girl from earlier…\"\n\"Yes, she's my friend.\"\nWhen Felix answered plainly, Madame Cassandra put her hand on her forehead and looked up at the ceiling.\n\"What a bummer. I thought she was going to be sold to one of our stores…\"\nAs Madame Cassandra blurted this out, she heard a clattering sound of running in the corridor. Moments later, Doris came running into the room with Monica by her side.\n\"Madame! Madame! Madaaame!\"\nIn Doris's arms, who was raising her voice, Monica was mumbling numbers with vacant eyes. Felix rounded his eyes at the sight of her appearance in a flimsy dress, like the ones the girls in this store wear, which looked like underwear. A kind of revealing dress that would look good on a woman as voluptuous as Doris, but when worn by Monica, who's too skinny, it made her look impoverished and uncomfortably cold.\nThe dark Bordeaux fabric only accentuated Monica's pallor, and the shoulder straps had already slipped halfway down, almost exposing her scanty bosom.\nDoris said to a surprised Felix, brushing her hair.\n\"I'm sorry, Sir Baron. I gave this little girl you came to sell us a little demonstration on how to please a man, and all of a sudden she's turning into a cripple. I'm really sorry, what should I do? Can I fix it by hitting her head?\"\nDoris's instruction, including the demonstration, was probably too intense for Monica. As a result, she seems to have tripped into the world of numbers, just like any other time.\n\"I'm sorry, Doris. I guess I was not clear enough.\"\n\"Hmm? You've come to sell this orphan girl to our store, right? Well, she's a little too skinny to be suitable for most men, but I'll make sure she's ready to take on customers, so don't worry about leaving her to me. This Doris will take good care of her.\"\n\"No, yeah, I mean…\"\nFrom then on, until Felix cleared up Doris's misunderstanding, while Monica kept muttering numbers with her empty eyes endlessly.",

Listen, our job is to please the customers, but they would get excited if they get a woman moaning and screaming by their hands, so you have to make yourself feel good too. For example, around here and here… also, touching here will make you feel good…\"\nAfter Doris thrust her hand groping into her clothes, Monica's memory was cut off from there.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n*kiss* A soft touch on her cheek brought Monica back to herself.\n\"Ah, a cat's paw…\"\nNero must have touched her on the cheek with his soft paw. Monica thought so, but when she looked around, she found herself neither in her mountain cabin nor in the attic, but in a room decorated with red and gold that was a sight painful to her eyes. She then turned to her left where the paw(?) had touched her cheek and found Felix was looking at her with an indescribable look on his face.\n\"Have you come to your senses?\"\n\"Yo!? Yo-yo-yo-yo…\"\nWhen Monica was about to say \"Your Highness\" Felix presses his forefinger against her lips.\nMonica broke out in cold sweat and darted her gaze at her surroundings. And realized that she was now sitting on a luxurious couch leaning against Felix, with Madame Cassandra sitting across from her and Doris by her side. She then met Doris' eyes, who gave a bitter smile as she was fiddling her amber hair with her finger.\n\"Well, I'm sorry. I thought you were going to be sold to our store.\"\n\"………….\"\nThat's when Monica finally noticed what she was wearing. It was Bordeaux's dress that looked like flimsy underwear—the one that Doris had forced her to wear after being dragged away earlier.\n*achoo* Monica sneezed, to which Felix took off his jacket and put it on her.\n\"Doris.\"\nFelix looked at Doris reproachfully, and Doris smiled wryly.\n\"Yeah, I'm sorry. I'll lend her some warm coats. And she might need some gloves too.\"\n\"Um, I… I just want my clothes back, that's all.\"\nMonica hurriedly stood up and shoved the jacket over her shoulder back at Felix.\n\"I'll return this to you…….*achoo*\"\nAs she sneezed, her dress, whose shoulder straps had slipped out, fell to her feet. Since she was not wearing any kind of corset today, her dress came off easily, leaving her upper body bare. After that, she crouched down to pick up the dress, pulled the shoulder straps over her shoulders, then carefully checking the hem of the dress to make sure it was not dirty.\nWatching such a scene, Felix and Doris were dumbfounded.\n\"…………\"\n\"…………\"\nMadame Cassandra raised her eyebrows at the unfazed Monica who put more concern over the stains on the dress rather than by the fact that her dress had just slipped off in public.\n\"What a strange girl.\"\n\"Um… Can I have my clothes back?\"\n\"Doris, give her back her clothes.\"\nWhen Madame Cassandra pointed with her chin, Doris answered, \"okay,\" and beckoned Monica over.\nMonica hesitated and Doris looked troubled as she scratched her cheek.\n\"Don't worry, I just want to give you your clothes back this time.\"\n\"O-Okay…\"\n\"Though If you want me to teach you how to please Sir Baron, I can teach you in secret.\"\nMonica shook her head furiously, and Doris giggled happily in response.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAfter Doris returned her clothes to her, Monica borrowed a warm fur coat and gloves. Having never worn a fur coat before, Monica was surprised at the hefty weight of the coat at first, but once she put it on, she found it to be very warm and windproof.\nIf I had this, I might don't need to cover myself up with a thin blanket when I'm writing on a cold night\n, thought Monica as she was secretly impressed, at which Felix gave a smile.\n\"Yup, it looks good on you. You look like a little animal when you put on a coat fur.\"\n\"P-Please stop calling me little squirrel…\"\n\"I won't, Monica. Now, let's get going.\"\nFelix said so as he held out his left arm to Monica slightly.\nAs Doris had taught her earlier, the proper way to handle this situation is to wrap her arms around him. However, the height difference between the petite Monica and the moderately tall Felix was too great. Monica agonized over it and pinched Felix's cuff with her fingertips. This way, she didn't have to worry about losing him. And Felix didn't rebuke at her gesture.\n\"Now, there are some stores I want to visit, but let's stroll around a bit. I think it's more fun to check out the stalls and street vendors first.\"\nHaving said that, Felix started walking, taking a street that has many stalls and street vendors on.\nWhile most people would expect to find stalls selling grilled skewers and juice, many of the stalls in the entertainment district at night sell accessories. Apparently, stall owners who sell food and drink during the daytime rent their stalls to those who sell accessories during the night.\n\"Hey there, mister. Why don't you take a look at my booth? You'll find all kinds of accessories that women will love. The girls in the brothel will be very happy to have this as a souvenir. How about some pretty bracelets for the young lady over there? We also have some earrings.\"\n\"I guess looking a bit won't be hurt.\"\nAs Felix stopped to look at the accessories on the stall, the shopkeeper was rubbing his hands.\n\"Our accessories are very special. After all, they come with the blessings of a famous magician.\"\n\"Oh, you have magic tools?\"\n\"Yeah, we've got something like that here.\"\nApparently, the words \"blessing\" and \"charm\" were more popular with young people than \"magic tool.\"\nThe shopkeeper began explaining in a plausible tone of voice that the necklace had a spell to increase one's charm and that the ring would ward off evil and so on.\nAll of the products were shining beautifully under the light of the lantern. The shopkeeper must be well aware of the fact that it's much harder to tell the difference between a cheap product and a high-quality one at night than in the daytime.\n…none of these seem to have any effect as a magic tool.\nThe base of the ring and the clasp were engraved with what appeared to be magic letters, but it was all complete nonsense. Perhaps Felix was aware of this but was pretending to be interested since his gaze at the accessories was devoid of any enthusiasm. In a way, he was just looking at it.\nAs Monica looked at the accessories, she suddenly noticed a brooch that has a different design from the others. To put it bluntly, the workmanship of the base of the brooch was extremely detailed. Compared to other cute-looking accessories, the ornamentation was much more elaborate. It was made of topaz and the magic formula engraved in it was real.\n…it has a simple defensive barrier but doesn't seem to be very detailed…\nThe shopkeeper raised his voice when he saw Monica stared at the brooch.\n\"Oh, you have a good eye, young lady. You could tell this brooch is different from the others. It's specially made.\"\nThe owner trailed off, bent forward a little then said in a lowered voice as if he was talking in secret.\n\"This brooch might be a second-hand, but… hey! It was made by one of the Seven Sages, the [Jewels Magician].\"\n\"Oh…\"\nThe mention of the Seven Sages made Monica wince. Standing next to her, Felix put his finger on his chin and muttered.\n\"I've heard that Emanuel Darwin, the [Jewels Magician], is a genius at making magic tools.\"\n\"You're very knowledgeable, mister. That's right! If you were to go through the proper channels, you could buy a house in the capital with the magic tools made by the [Jewels Magician]. Here, I am offering it at a special price… how about it?\"\n\"Can I see the brooch?\"\nAfter Felix said this, the shopkeeper said amiably, \"Here you go,\" wrapping the brooch in cloth and offering it to him. He then took the brooch and reflected the topaz in the light of the lantern. Probably confirming there was a magic formula lying inside.\nIn the back of the magic formula, Emanuel Darwin's name was inscribed in a very small font.\nNo matter how one looks at it, this brooch was a counterfeit. The magic formula was not precise enough, and to begin with, a magic tool made by the Seven Sages could not have been sold in a stall like this. The only thing that bothered Monica was the way the brooch was decorated. She had seen a brooch very similar to this one before.\n… it looks similar to Lord Cyril's brooch…\nCyril Ashley, who has a constitution that makes him prone to storing mana, always wore a magic tool brooch to absorb and release the magic power within his body. Monica had directly held the brooch in her hand, so there was no way she could be wrong.\nLord Cyril's brooch also had the name of the [Jewels Magician] engraved on it.\nCyril's brooch had not been applied with a spell to prevent it from deteriorating over time. And now, the brooch in Felix's hand only has a crude defensive barrier. These two were very similar, in either with the decorations on the brooch and the quirks of the magic formula.\n\"Great, I like it. I'll take the brooch.\"\n\"Hehe, that's very generous of you, mister. Thank you very much.\"\nBefore taking the brooch, Felix paid the price, which was an extraordinary amount of money to pay at a food stall.\nMonica watched Felix put the brooch away in his pocket with a hesitant feeling.\n…\nDoes His Highness notice that the brooch is similar to Lord Cyril's brooch?\nShe could not tell what his thoughts were from Felix's beautiful profile, and yet, without particular reason, she kept staring at him, to which he moved his blue eyes to look at her.\n\"Hey, Monica. Are there any accessories you want? I'll buy you anything if you like it.\"\n\"…No. I'm fine.\"\nWhen Monica shook her head slowly, Felix leaned down a little and looked into Monica's face.\n\"You were wearing makeup the other day at the chess tournament. It looked really good on you.\"\n\"…………\"\n\"Would you let me give you some accessories that would look good on you at that time?\"\nMost ladies would swoon over if Felix whispered in a mellow, sweet voice. But Monica didn't feel anything from it. And now, she was thinking in her own way and said clumsily.\n\"Um… Your… I mean Eig, do you still remember at the time we met for the first time?\"\n\"In the old garden when you've been dropping your nuts?\"\n\"Yeah, when you picked up the nuts at that time… I was really… really happy.\"\nFor Monica, who was just recently enrolled in the school and had no one she was familiar with, the ribbon that Lana gave her and the berries that Felix picked up were treated as treasures. She even thought it was a waste to eat them.\n\"Well, I can't really put it into words, but…even if I were to buy accessories here now, I'm sure I wouldn't be as happy as I was with the nuts at that time… I think.\"\nAt Monica's crude words, Felix lowered his eyebrows slightly and smiled wistfully.\n\"I see…\"\nThe lonely look on his face made Monica feel terribly sorry for him. No matter what the reason was, the fact remained that Monica had rejected Felix's goodwill. So, Monica hurriedly continued with her words.\n\"Also, I-I've only recently become interested in fashion, since I'm still a beginner, accessories are still too high on my plate… well, accessories are for more experienced people, so I don't think I'm ready yet!\"\nAs Monica frantically said this, Felix stared at her blankly, and the next moment he began giggling happily.\n\"Oh well… haha, I guess I'll leave it at that.\"\nMonica nodded briskly and inwardly patted her chest in relief.",

      "content": "After passing through a street lined with accessory stalls, they came to a street lined with bustling bars. On the other side of the open door, visitors can catch a glimpse of a minstrel playing lute, men drinking and singing merrily, and women leaning over to pour a drink. As Monica was looking at that scene absentmindedly, Felix looked at her.\n\"Are you hungry?\"\nMonica shook her head, but then Felix turned his attention to the end of the street.\n\"Then, shall we proceed straight to our destination store?\"\nThere was no hesitation in Felix's steps. Apparently, he had done deciding on what kind of store he plans to drop by.\n\"…Um, what kind of store are we going to?\"\n\"That will be for you to see when you get there. But I'm sure you'll like it too.\"\nEvidently, they had to walk a bit to get to that store.\nWhat kind of store it was exactly for a member of the royal family like Felix had to sneak out of his dormitory to visit, Monica wondered. Judging from Felix's behavior in the House of Madame Cassandra, he seemed to be accustomed to visiting brothels. She even saw Felix waving in a friendly manner at a young girl who was standing in front of a store when she was saying, \"Baron!\" to call him out.\n\"Baron\" was probably just his alias in this place.\nWhile at school he looked so well-behaved, his conduct appeared unrestrained and carefree—is that how the royal family behaving, she wondered.\nEven so, Monica couldn't shake the small feeling of discomfort in her heart for some reason.\n\"Your… I mean, Eig.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"… Are you having fun when hanging out at night?\"\n\"Do I look like not having fun right now?\"\nFelix blinked his golden eyelashes, which didn't match his black wig, and tilted his head slightly.\nMonica hesitated just a bit, then opened her mouth.\n\"You appear to look like ‘having fun.'\"\nAt Monica's words, Felix closed his eyes once, then opened them. For a moment, the expression on his composed face disappeared and was replaced by a smile on his face as if he had given up on everything.\n\"Maybe you're right.\"\nFelix affirmed Monica's words vaguely, tilted his head up to stare at the sky. Even the stars at night in this brightly lit city don't look too pretty, he still squinted a little, trying to find it.\n\"…A friend of mine once told me.\"\nStill looking up, Felix muttered quietly.\n\"‘\nI wish you could find many things you can be passionate about that you like, you enjoy, not for anyone else, but for yourself.'\n\"\nEvery time Felix uttered each of those words, his white breath blended into the darkness of the night. Just like a fog.\n\"Since that day, I've been searching for all this time, whether it's things I'd love, I'd enjoy, or I'd be passionate about.\"\n\"…did you find it, in this city?\"\n\"I did. And it was the place where we're heading to.\"\nThat answer alone had proved how little interest he really had in the glamorous nightlife. Maybe strutting proudly through the exciting nightlife and spending time with beautiful women was not something he wished.\nStill, among that many forms of entertainment, he was looking for things he'd be passionate about while pretending to enjoy it, even it was just for appearance… but somewhere in the back of his mind, he let out a sigh and thought, \"This is not what I want\". Nevertheless, for the sake of his friend's wish, he was still looking for ‘something that he'd love.'\n\"Sooner or later, when I become king, I will lose my freedom. When that happens, I won't be able to hang out like this… so only this time I can be \"me\", even if only for a short time.\"\nMonica bit her lip and wondered if she should express the doubts that were welling up in her heart. Depending on the circumstances, doubting his reasoning could be considered disrespectful—and ending up with her head decapitated would be a natural thing.\nStill, Monica wanted to know the truth. What was Felix really thinking?\n\"…Do you still want to be a king, even though you know you'll lose your freedom?\"\n\"Do I want to be a king? …I guess you're a bit wrong about that.\"\nFelix shook his head slowly then looked down at Monica. The expression drained from his composed face, and his jewel-like blue eyes lost their sparkle.\n\"\nI\nhave to be king.\"\nYes, being born into royalty and aiming to be king is a natural thing—a feeling that Monica will never understand.\nThe topic of the succession to the throne is a very delicate one. So having someone doubt him might lead him to get an insult saying that he's not fit to be a king.\nThat's why Monica bowed deeply to Felix.\n\"I-I'm sorry for asking you such a rude question.\"\n\"I don't mind. Honestly, I'm glad you're taking an interest in me. Especially since you've been surprisingly indifferent to me.\"\n\"Ueh!?\" Monica yelped out unconsciously like a frog that had been hit by a carriage.\nWhat Felix said has a point. Although Monica had some consciousness for Felix, it was as a target for her protection, not for the individual himself. At most, he had an amazing body with a golden ratio in her mind.\nAs Monica lingered in silence, breaking out in a cold sweat, Felix put his finger on her chin to lift her downcast face.\n\"If you feel sorry for yourself, then you should tell me about yourself next.\"\n\"A-A-About myself…?\"\n\"There are so many secrets surrounding you.\"\nMonica's face tensed up. Her biggest secret was the fact that she's Monica Everett, the Seven Sages, the [Silent Witch]. She thought she had managed to keep it hidden until now, but perhaps Felix had figured out Monica's true identity?\n\"Like you would appear in the place wherever I present. Entering the secret old garden where you can't enter without a key, witnessing my escape from the dormitory, and now… here you are.\"\nThe reason Monica was able to enter the closed old garden was because of her spell. The reason she witnessed Felix's sneaking out of the dormitory at that exact moment was because of Nero's help. And now, the fact that Monica was standing here was because of Lynn's help.\n…And all of them were things that can't be done by an ordinary student.\nFelix took Monica's pale hand and placed it on his own neck. And Just like he had warmed her hand earlier, he tried to warm Monica's hand,\n\"When I realized you were following me, the first thing that crossed my mind was you were an assassin who wanted to kill me. But when I put your hand on my neck like this earlier, your fingers never tried to strangle me. After all, anyone who seeks an opportunity to assassinate someone would think of this as a chance.\"\nMonica paled immediately, realized Felix was testing Monica's response at that time.\n\"Since you didn't do anything because it was a crowded road, then how about now when we're on a deserted road? If you were planning to assassin me, you can do it now, whether to strangle or cut my neck.\"\n\"I-I would never dare…\"\nMonica quickly denied it, and Felix simply nodded, \"Yeah, I know.\" But, to her disappointment, he said plainly.\n\"You're not an assassin. If you were, you'd have killed me by now.\"\n\"…………\"\n\"Whatever your purpose is, you are far too suspicious to have been hired by anyone. I don't think you're an enemy, but you're too unreliable to be an ally. That's why I've been treated you as an interesting pet.\"\n\"Pe-Pe… Pet!?\"\nLooking at the flabbergasted Monica, Felix chuckled mischievously.\n\"Now we're just fellow night outers sharing the same secret.\"\nHe then extended his index finger and flicked it against Monica's forehead.\n\"And did you realize it? You could have made a good deal in this situation, like ‘if you didn't want me to find out that your night out, you'd do what I said.'\"\n\"…It's just that…well…t-t-there's nothing in particular that… I want from you.\"\nAfter winning the chess match from Felix, she had requested him to stop calling her Little Squirrel. But, since Monica had given up and let him called her by her name, there was nothing more she wants from Felix.\n\"……I don't have anything that I want from you, nor I expect anything from you… really.\"\n\"Yeah, I've known that much after spending together in the past few months. That you never expect anything from me.\"\nFelix turned his back on Monica and walked a few steps ahead of her. Then, without looking back at Monica, he suddenly said.\n\"Well, that's might be comforting but also a bit lonely.\"\nFelix started walking slowly while Monica followed behind quickly.\nFeeling bad about standing next to Felix, so she walked diagonally behind him with her head hanging down, but he entangled his own fingers with hers before starting to walk again.\nAnd to Monica's confusion, Felix said.\n\"I told you before, didn't I? I'm looking for things that I like and enjoy. I do enjoy playing you out, so I'm not going to pry into who you are. So why don't you give me more attention?\"\n\"Ha… Playing… me…?\"\n\"Oh, let me correct that. I'm enjoying playing out\nwith\nyou.\"\n\"You just said \"playing me\"… \"me\"…\"\nFelix dragged Monica, who was making muffled grunting noises, by hand, then looked ahead before giving a particularly cheerful voice.\n\"Look, the store we're looking for is in sight.\"\nEven though she knew she was being deceived, she looked the way he pointed out and saw an old brick house. Hanging from the door was a small lamp and a wooden plaque, with the orange light from the lamp illuminating the words on it. And engraved in the unadorned plate were the words \"Porter Antiquarian Bookstore\" in rugged letters.\n\"Now, Monica. Let me tell you something. This store is my favorite place.\"",

      "content": "*creak* After he opened the door opened, the sight of a row of bookshelves that were evenly spaced within the store appeared before her.\nEach gap between the bookshelves was so narrow that one person could barely pass through.\nWithout hesitation, Felix made his way between the second and third bookshelves from the right. And Monica hesitantly followed behind him.\nMonica could smell the unique scent of old paper and insect repellent herbs in the store. This was different from the night city filled with the scent of makeup, perfume, and alcohol, which eased Monica's mind a little.\nGlancing at the books on the shelves as she walked, she noticed the books were crammed with academic books related to medicinal herbs and medicine. This was not Monica's area of expertise, but she could somehow tell that the books were kept in good condition.\nEventually, after passing through a narrow gap in the bookshelves, they arrived at a small counter where a man was sitting, writing by the light of a lamp.\nThe man with brown skin and stiff black hair was wearing a pair of glasses, and maybe with some foreign blood flowing in his veins. His almond-shaped eyes and deeply chiseled face made it difficult to tell his age. He could be in his twenties or forties.\nPerhaps because of the creaking sound from walking, it had made him noticed their presence, but the man didn't raise his head up from his papers.\n\"Good evening, Porter.\"\nFelix called out to him, but the shopkeeper didn't raise his head up. He seemed so engrossed with his writings as if he cannot hear the voices of his customers. Eventually, he stopped his writing, putting back his quill pen into the inkpot then opened his mouth.\n\"Evening…\"\nHe said as he nodded briskly before continuing with his writings. From the looks of it, he seemed to be writing some manuscript instead of ledgers.\nThe eccentric attitude of the man, who refused to change his curt attitude even towards the obviously aristocratic Felix, vaguely reminded her of Claudia.\n\"Monica, this is Porter. He's the owner of this store and a novelist. He spends about half the year traveling from place to place stocking books. It's lucky we met him today.\"\n\"That's right. I just got back from stocking up the other day. Got a few books you might enjoy.\"\n\"Really?\"\nFelix spoke in a lively voice with a lit-up face.\nPorter pointed with his quill to a bookshelf by the wall where the books that Felix would enjoy were.\nAfter heading to the corner where Porter pointed, Felix picked up the book before letting out an \"Oh!\" word in a cheerful voice.\n\"‘Minerva's Spring' Back Number.'\nMonica turned pale when she saw the magazine Felix had picked up.\nEvery six months, the magician training institute Minerva publishes a magazine that summarizes the research results of its students and professors called \"Minerva's Spring'. Naturally, as a scholarship student, Monica's thesis has been published several times.\nW-W-W-W-W-W-Why, of all the book, His Highness was picking up that book!?\nWhile 80% of the articles in the magazine were related to magic. The other 20% consisted of the professor's essays and the student council's trivia on how to live a comfortable life as a student.\nMaybe His Highness is a big fan of the professor's essays on hair growth…\nIt must be, it has to be. Or maybe he's just looking for some wisdom on how to live a comfortable student life. I can't think of any other reason. As Monica was thinking this to herself, Felix, who was flipping through a magazine, said with a childlike manner as his eyes gleamed.\n\"There's a [Silent Witch]'s essay in it!\"\nD-D-Did he just says S-SIlent Witch!? S-Silent Witch!? What? I must have misheard it… I'm sure…\nWhile Monica looked like falling apart at any moment, Porter stopped moving his pen and opened his mouth.\n\"All three of the books there have articles regarding the Witch of Silence in them. Also, The most recent one contains her recent contribution.\"\n\"Porter! You did a splendid job!\"\nFelix's voice was clearly agitated. Yes, he was excited. Monica had never seen Felix's eyes shine so brightly in these past months.\nWhile Monica was stunned, unable to take in the various shocks, Felix laughed, slightly embarrassed.\n\"Are you surprised? I'm actually interested in magic…\"\n\"Um, but you said you didn't take any basic magic classes…\"\n\"Because of some circumstances, my grandfather forbade me to study anything related to magic.\"\nFelix's words came as a surprise to Monica.\nGranted, a royal family member is demanded to have more skills in politics and languages than in magic. Nevertheless, many members of the royal family of the Ridill Kingdom have a talent for magic, and there have been several excellent magicians in the royal family in the past generations.\nThe current king is also said to be an earth magician, and Felix's brother, the first prince, was a graduate of Minerva.\nIt just didn't make any sense to Monica why they would go to the trouble of banning them to study magic.\nTo Monica's bewilderment, he continued to flip through the magazine, without hiding his good mood.\n\"A grimoire is usually expensive and thick in size, right? Moreover, depending on the item, you need to have qualifications to read or buy it. That's why sneaking them in and hiding them in my room is quite difficult.\"\nSo, he decided to use Minerva's Spring, which was relatively easy to get hold of.\nHowever, the papers published in Minerva's Spring were strictly selected. To understand them, one needs to have the knowledge of an intermediate-level magician.\nHow much knowledge does Felix possess about magic? While Monica was wondering about this, Felix was still flipping through \"Minerva's Spring\" and seemed to be more talkative than usual.\n\"I had read the previous article on the coordinates of the [Silent Witch]'s wide range magic formula, and it was brilliant. I can't believe she wrote that as a student. To put it simply, by not incorporating the tracking technique into the wide range magic formula, the spell can be activated with a pinpoint in the exact target location to increase the accuracy. Because her calculation method to pinpoint the exact coordination is so ground-breaking, it had reduced so many steps in creating the magic formula…\"\nMonica was paying \"attentively\" with a stiff face.\n… well, yes… that's right… the current tracking formula has many shortcomings, so before improving the tracking formula, I wanted to make a compact wide range magic formula without incorporating the tracking formula first… Waaaaah, he really understands it!\nWhile Monica was flinching, Felix looked at her before suddenly realizing his embarrassing behavior.\n\"Forgive me, I'm actually a big fan of her. When it comes to the [Silent Witch], I can't help but be rather talkative.\"\n\"…F-Fan!?\"\n\"Although she's the youngest among the Seven Sages and doesn't have as many flashy accomplishments as the [Barrier Magician], I think she's made a significant contribution to the field of basic magic in our Ridill Kingdom. In addition, her no-chant magic is… well, it was very beautiful.\"\nAs Felix uttered the last word, he looked somewhat enraptured.\nBut Monica was no longer concerned with that.\nHas he ever seen me use no-chanting magiiiiiiiiic?! When exactly has he seen me?! Doesn't this mean that… he knows who I am!? There's no way… right?\n\"I have never seen such beautiful magic in my life… Oh, I wish I could see that no-chant magic with my own eyes again.\"\nAs Felix let out a wistful exhale, Porter muttered to himself.\n\"You know, I'm currently writing a scene in my new novel about a foolish man who falls in love with a stage actress. And Abram, a friend of the main protagonist Bartholomew, who's in love with the stage actress Catherine says:\n\"Oh, I'd like to see her play again with my own eyes.\"\n…and your expression was exactly like that.\"\n\"Well, you might be right, Porter. Yeah, maybe that's what they call first love.\"\nF-First love…\nFinally, Monica's whole body convulsed. Maybe because she was too shocked, her head and her facial muscles were not working properly.\nWhat should I do? I wanna escape to the world of numbers.\n\"Surprised? This is what I\nam\nobsessed with right now.\"\n\"U-Um… Y-Your… I mean Eig, have you ever met with [Silent Witch]?\"\nWhen Monica asked with an ashen look on her face, Felix nodded, his cheeks rosy with fascination.\n\"Yeah, at the inauguration and New Year's ceremonies. But she always wears a hooded robe and few people know her real face. She always leaves the party after the ceremony, so I never had a chance to talk to her nor seen her face in person.\"\nThank God, he hasn't found out who I am yet… Monica patted her chest. But it was too early to be relieved.\n\"But if I become the king, I can meet her whenever I want, so it's not a problem. The Seven Sages are the king's advisors, after all.\"\nIt was a big problem. Once he became king, he'd be able to talk to her directly… maybe even get a glimpse of her true face.\nYou should definitely not do that, please don't do that, I'm not the kind of person who can be consulted by the king, in fact, I apologize for being the [Silent Witch]… I'm soryyyyyyyyyyy\nMonica finally turned over, clutching her stomach.\nWhat should I do? I feel like I'm going to throw up everything I ate at the [Star Oracle Witch]'s mansion here.\nFor the time being, Monica made a firm vow to keep her attendance at the ceremony to a minimum and to never take her hood off.",

      "content": "Monica looked around the store while Felix was happily rifling through the back issues of \"Minerva's Spring\". His shocking statement made her stomach hurt a little, but the antiquarian bookstore was certainly something that made Monica's heart skip a beat.\nThey have everything from so-called old books that have been published relatively recently to what are called old books from a time when printing and bookbinding technologies were not yet developed. A quick look around the store showed that about half of the books on the shelves were entertainment novels for the general public, while the other half were practical and academic books. There were also some rare books that were out of print. Though she wanted to read some magic books, as expected, if she did that in front of Felix, he would discover that she could use magic.\nAs she walked around the bookshelves looking for a math book, she stopped in front of a certain shelf. There was a shelf of medical books and biology books. Feeling there's some familiar name, which had made her curious. Calming her heart, which was beating faster than usual, Monica slowly followed the words on the bookshelf.\n\"!\"\nA certain book caught Monica's eyes. A book that had been published five years ago—then banned for its publication before they were withdrawn and burned all of them.\n[Magical Properties Deciphered from Genetic Traits by Benedict Raine]\nMonica reached the book as if being drawn to the book before picking it up and flipping the cover with trembling fingers.\nLike she had heard many times before, it had started with a sentence:\n——Human body is made up of a vast array of numbers.\nThe contents of the book were difficult to understand without knowledge of both biology and magic, and Monica, who had not majored in biology, could only understand about half of the content.\nStill, Monica was able to remember the numbers in the charts and graphs.\n\"…18473726, 385, 20985.726, 29405.84739, 235, 2108877, 25…\"\nThat book, for its every page had been burned to ashes, was the proof of her father's life after he was executed as a heretic. And now, the book which she had burned into her eyes, was now in perfect form before her.\nMonica hugged the book to her chest and rushed over to Porter.\n\"E-Excuse me… I'd like… to buy… this book… please!\"\nPorter lifted his head from his manuscript paper and looked at Monica. Then he looked at the title of the book, and his eyes behind his glasses widened slightly.\n\"My friend has entrusted that book to me. And I don't have any intention of charging a low price for it.\"\nMonica was surprised to learn that this man, Porter, was a friend of her late father. But since she couldn't bring up the topic of her father in front of Felix, she forced down her agitation before leaning forward to ask:\n\"H-How much?\"\nPorter held up two fingers and held them out in front of Monica. The price for this kind of specialist book was about one silver coin. But he was asking for two silver coins, doubled of that price.\n\"Two gold coins.\"\nMonica gulped unconsciously. Two gold coins are enough for a commoner who lives a modest life to live for a while without working. And she, who's been working as a Seven Sage, had earned enough saving to set up a house in the royal capital. But since she rarely does any shopping, doesn't usually carry around a lot of money, let alone bringing two gold coins.\n\"U-Um, could you keep this book for me? I will definitely come back to pay you someday, so…\"\n\"How many years does it take a child like you to earn two gold coins?\"\n\"*groan*\"\nMonica could pay two gold coins if she wanted to. But, if she says that here, it would leave a chance of her true identity will be revealed.\nWhile Monica was desperately trying to think of a way to ask for a reservation, Felix, who had been standing next to Monica, placed two gold coins on the counter.\n\"Will this be enough?\"\nMonica couldn't help but look up at Felix with wide eyes.\n\"I-I couldn't accept this… I-I couldn't let you pay this for me… e-especially with this much money.\"\n\"Think of it as payment for keeping your mouth shut about my nightlife.\"\nFelix then bent down a little and looked into Monica's face.\n\"I know you wouldn't be happy about me giving you accessories, but… you want to get this book, no?\"\n\"Well, that's… but two gold coins…\"\n\"I don't know what the book is worth, but to you, it's worth a lot, isn't it?\"\nThe moment Monica heard those words, tears spilled from her eyes.\nEverybody had scoffed at her father's research, at the books that were being burned, as worthless. They trampled them, tore them to pieces, and threw them into the flames. No matter how much Monica claimed its value, no one listened to her…in fact, she was not allowed to even try to tell them its value, so her uncle beat her. He beat her again, and again, and again, telling her not to say unnecessary things. So insistently until Monica lost her words.\nFelix doesn't know the value of this book. Nevertheless, he acknowledged and allowed Monica to cherish this book. After having thought all of it, Monica was so happy when she heard those words. Nodding her head over and over again as her tears streaming down her face.\nIt was a book that was worth that much to her. It was proof of her father's life.\nFelix bent down and wiped the tears from Monica's eyes with his fingertips.\n\"Well, I didn't mean to make you cry… but won't you smile for me?\"\nFelix gently lowered his eyelids when Monica forced her crying face to smile.\nPorter snatched up a gold coin with a sour look.\n\"I did receive two gold pieces.\"\nThen stashed the gold coins in a small safe before giving the book to Monica.\nHer father's book was worth two gold coins.\n\"Now this book is yours.\"\nMonica wiped her tears with the sleeve of her dress and received the book with trembling hands. Holding her father's book to her chest, she bowed deeply to Porter and Felix.\n\"Thank you so much for making this book… worth so much!\"\n\"… Shouldn't the person who's being charged be angry that it's a scam?\"\nTo Porter's dismay, Monica shook her head desperately\nHer father would not have been interested in its reputation or its value which other people put on it, but Monica was still much happier than if his books had been sold at a low price.\nFelix gently looked at Monica, who was holding the book to her chest, crying with her nose all red, but still smiling happily, with eyes that seemed to be looking at something nostalgic.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThere was a big party being held in the House of Madame Cassandra. The reason for this was because a certain wealthy guest had donated a large sum of money to the store. And the said guest was staying with a certain girl in the most magnificent room. Though he said he didn't need to bring in the store girl, it would be a disservice to the House of Madame Cassandra if she didn't provide any service.\nDoris, the most popular woman in the store, left the party and knocked on the door of her guest's room with a light snack, a fruit platter, and a bottle of the finest liquor she could find.\nIn case they were having a good time in bed, I could mix it up with them. But if the childish-looking girl isn't doing well, this Big Sis Doris could teach her a thing or two.\nDoris opened the door with these thoughts in mind and involuntarily blinked her eyes.\nHer guests were seated on a sofa in the most luxurious room of the restaurant, both of them reading quietly.\n\"Wait, wait, wait! How can a pair of young men and women stay up this late reading together! A healthy man and a healthy woman should have done more than this!\"\n\"Oh, Doris. Could you leave the drinks there for me? I am getting at the good part.\"\nDoris had no idea what the real name of the man who was a regular at the store was. He called himself a baron, but she had a hunch that he must have been of higher status than that.\nWhat was important to Doris was not who the man was, but how he behaved in bed and how much money he paid. In both of these senses, this baron was perfect.\nHe did not look down on the girls, he did not act arrogant or violent, and he was good in bed. In addition, his good looks and well money have caused more than a few of the girls to fall in love with him.\nAnd the said baron who knows how to have fun at night, despite the fact that he's alone with a young girl, he's reading a book together!\n\"Hey, little girl! Are you okay with that? It's like you're implying Sir Baron is unattractive!\"\n\"Well, this book proposes that genetic traits are small particles called genetic particles, which are like the blueprint of a person, and depending on these particles, you can determine the amount of magic power and special attributes.\"\n\"I didn't mean that kind of topic!\"\nDoris poured the liquor she had brought into an empty glass and pushed it to Monica.\n\"Here, drink this!\"\n\"Oh, okay.\"\nMonica tipped the glass as offered. After concentrating too much on her reading, she was thirsty and drank half of the glass in one gulp.\nDoris also poured some liquor into Sir Baron's glass, and he took a light sip before closing his eyes.\n\"Hmm, this is a good wine.\"\n\"Isn't it? They're very good. Madame told me to bring you some.\"\n\"Mm, reading a book accompanied by a good wine is not so bad.\"\n\"This isn't what wine is for!\"\nJust as Doris yelled at him, Monica closed her book and stood up silently. Her eyes were somewhat vacant and unfocused.\n\"…Monica?\"\nMonica's mouth moved in a squirming motion when the Baron put down his magazine and called out to her.\n‘…Uuu… it's hot…\" said Monica as she abruptly took off the clothes she was wearing. It was an instantaneous event that the two did not have time to stop it.\nHer eccentricities did not end there. As she approached Sir Baron with a wobbly gait, she grabbed his hand and flattened his palm with her fingers.\n\"…there's no paw.\"\nThere are more places to touch when it comes to pleasing a gentleman. Why the palm? What's more, she made a strange statement about the paw. It doesn't make any sense.\nthought Doris in a daze as Monica pressed Sir Baron's hand against her own cheek before lowering her eyebrows sadly and muttered:\n\"…there's no paaaw.\"\nMonica sniffed sadly, tottered over to the bed, and curled up on it in her underwear as if she was an animal. And like that, she left mysterious words like, \"I want to be a cat…\" and fell asleep.\nDoris turned her head slowly to look at Sir Baron.\n\"Sir Baron, did you just pick up a cat?'\n\"Well, that was the first time I saw it too. I'm honestly surprised.\"\n\"What did she mean by the paw, anyway?\"\n\"I wonder.\"\nWhen they returned their attention to the bed, they saw Monica was munching in her sleep, looking very happy indeed.",

      "content": "She felt like she was having a pleasant dream. While the content of the dream is hard to remember, she did remember her father smiling calmly at her.\n\"…dad.\"\nMonica, who had been sleeping in a blissful dream, shivered from the chilly weather. The early morning wind when the winter approaching penetrated even through the slightest crack in the blanket. Crawling into the depths of the blanket, she noticed that there was something warm nearby and unconsciously approached it. When she put her body against it, it felt warm and cozy.\nBut he does seem rather large for Nero… hmm…\nI don't know what it is, but it's warm, so it's okay, thought Monica, abandoning her thoughts and falling asleep. A soft hand stroked Monica's hair, and then something softly touched her cheek.\nMonica was familiar with this pleasant feeling.\n\"…Paw… Good morning, Nero…\"\n\"Nero?\"\nMonica was instantly arisen by a voice that came from close by. Opening her eyes to the limit to stare at the voice revealed jewel-like blue eyes staring tenderly at Monica.\nMonica squealed inaudibly and rolled off the bed. Which followed by dynamic rumbles after.\nAs she crawled on the floor, the prophecy of Mary Harvey, the [Star Oracle Witch], flashed through her mind.\n—I can foresee your love life is on a roll right now! Moreover, you might end up spending a passionate night with a nice gentleman~☆\nCould this be the kind of thing where maybe, just maybe, I have crossed the line? thought Monica as she rubbed her forehead on the floor before saying in a shaky voice.\n\"Exe…\"\n\"Exe?\"\n\"Will I be executed…?\"\nFelix chuckled at the deathly look on Monica's face as he raised his upper body on the bed. He's not wearing anything on his upper body, completely naked. She had snuggled against that chest, after all. Having her head chopped off wasn't something she could complain about.\n\"Do you think I'd kill a cute little kitten just because it got into my bunk?\"\n\"Eh? A cat?\"\nMonica brought her face up and glanced around. Yet, she could not see any cat in the room. Where's the cat? thought Monica as she tilted her head, at which Felix looked with amusement.\n\"You drank a glass of wine last night, then all of a sudden you took off your clothes and fell asleep.\"\nMonica finally realized why she was in her underwear. No wonder she felt so cold. At least, she didn't cross the line and breathed a sigh of relief at that fact.\n\"Don't you feel cold in that outfit?\"\n\"Oh, yes. I apologize for showing you something embarrassing. I'll get changed soon… Huh?\"\nFeeling a strange sensation around her neck, she touched it with her fingers and felt thin chains that felt like a necklace. As she lowered her gaze, she saw small greenstone glittering on her chest, reflecting the morning sun.\nMonica gave Felix a puzzled look to which Felix rested his cheek on his propped-up knee and narrowed his eyes.\n\"It resembles the color of your eyes, after all. They look good together.\"\n\"This is…\"\n\"You told me you wouldn't be as happy as that time if I gave you jewelry.\"\nMonica lowered her eyebrows and gave a small nod. But looking at her response, Felix felt a bit lonely before giving her a sad smile.\nMonica silently studied the necklace. Hanging at the end of the thin golden chain was an olive green stone, slightly larger than her pinky nail. The bright green color with a slight golden tinge was probably peridot. The modest and cute design must have been chosen with her personality in mind. Nevertheless, she, not accustomed to accessories, looked up at Felix in confusion.\n\"Um, I know you've been paying for this room, and you also paid for the book for a huge sum, but I can't receive any more than this…\"\nMonica would feel bad if she received any gifts more than that. So she reached for the clasp on the back of her neck to take the necklace off and return it to him. But not familiar with this kind of thing, she didn't know how to take it off.\nAs she clumsily moved her fingers, Felix got off the bed to hold her hand from above. But, the moment he touched her, Monica's body tensed up.\nGrowing up with her father's personal medical books and models of the human body, the idea of seeing or being seen naked was not a concern for Monica. But being touched by people is scary. Recalling how unreasonably violent her uncle was, her body unconsciously tensed up.\nFelix brought Monica's hand down from where it was trying to remove her necklace when she was shivering for a different reason than the cold. After which, he ran his fingertips along the gold chain that adorned Monica's neck.\n\"I know you were thinking that this necklace is too early for you… But I didn't give this necklace to you. I'm giving it to you for my own satisfaction, for my own sake.\"\nUnsure of what Felix was trying to say, Monica looked up at him with a confused look in her eyes.\nFelix gave a slightly bitter smile and plucked the peridot with his fingertips, pulling it lightly. The thin chain dug into Monica's skin just a little.\n\"A tangible gift—especially a wearable one—is a good way to hold people's hearts together, right?\"\nHolding people's hearts together with things. That's a very proud aristocrat thing to say.\nSo why does this person look so lonely?\nFelix's exquisite fingertips lifted the peridot. His shapely lips drop a kiss to the olive green jewel which's much like Monica's eyes.\n\"I want you to remember these memories. The memories of [Eig] who's been hanging out with you.\"\nAt first glance, the scene would have looked like a man and a woman who had spent the night together vowing their love to each other in the morning light, with their clothes in disarray.\nHowever, as she gazed at Felix's long eyelashes in front of her, Monica was quietly thinking.\n—I will probably never be able to hang out at night with [Eig] again.\nThat's why Felix gave Monica so many gifts, to the point of being excessive. To preserve as many memories as possible of the young man named Eig.\nOnce Felix took his hand away from the peridot, the beautiful olive green reflected against Monica's pale skin. The peridot shone beautifully in the colors of the meadow as the morning sun glimmered through the window. Her eyes, which usually looked brownish, likewise turned a little darker green in the bright light.\n\"Peridot glows beautifully, even in the slightest light on a dark night. I'm sure I can find you easily if you wear it.\"\nThe usual Monica would have thought \"you don't have to find me\" to Felix with a pale face. But right now, she doesn't want to hurt Eig by denying him. So, she tried her best to choose her words, despite her clumsiness.\n\"…Eig.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"I had a lot of fun hanging out at night with you… even though there were a lot of surprises.\"\n\"…yeah.\"\nIn the future, the likelihood that Monica will wear a peridot necklace herself is not likely to happen. Still, for now, she stopped reaching for the clasp, feeling that Eig would be sad if she took the necklace off.\nEventually, Monica got up and picked up her clothes, which were folded on the couch. She was strangely happy to see that the book she had bought yesterday was also neatly placed on top of her clothes, away from the drinks and food.\nAs Monica was getting dressed, Felix suddenly remembered to look at Monica's back and said.\n\"Actually, I've been wondering since yesterday… how did you get that old scar on your back?\"\n\"…? there's still some scars remains?\"\n\"To a certain extent. Especially around the shoulders.\"\nFortunately, there was a large dressing table inside the room, so Monica twisted around a little to look at her own back. Sure enough, there were some bruises and raised skin marks on her back. All of them are remnants of the time when she was beaten by her uncle.\n\"Was that done by Count Kerbeck's family?\"\nMonica shook her head in alarm at Felix's words. Her current status is that of a nuisance to Count Kerbeck's family, but it would be dishonorable to accuse Isabelle and the others of abusing her.\n\"Not at all! Count Kerbeck's family has been treating me really, really well! This scar was from a long time ago…\"\n\"Have you ever wanted to make that scar disappear cleanly?\"\n\"…no, not really.\"\nMonica meant this from the bottom of her heart. Besides, the scars weren't anything that would hurt her now, and having an old scar on her back wouldn't interfere with her work. She lacked the sensitivity to regard scars as ugly, but for Felix, the presence of scars on a woman's body was not something to be overlooked.\nSuddenly, Monica noticed. Felix's body also had a scar on his side that looked like it had been stabbed by something. His perfectly proportioned body was beautifully smooth, which made the scar on his waist stand out even more.\n\"That scar on your waist… do you want to remove it?\"\nFelix looked down at his own scars and shook his head gently when Monica asked timidly.\n\"… it's okay. This is the scar required for me.\"\nShe didn't know what he meant by that, but she felt that she shouldn't pry too deeply into the matter, so she just kept quiet and finished getting dressed.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThe girls of the House of Madame Cassandra gave Felix and Monica a grand send-off. Doris, in particular, after kissing Felix passionately on the cheek, beckoned Monica over to listen.\n\"If you have any trouble eating, you can always come to our house. We'll take care of you.\"\n\"T-Thanks…\"\n\"Also, Sir Baron's weakness is—— …you get it. Keep that in mind.\"\nMonica felt like remembering that would not be helpful at all. So she just smiled vaguely and nodded back at Doris.\nAfter leaving the House of Madame Cassandra, Felix made his way to the place where the carriage was parked. Although he had offered to give Monica a ride in his carriage, she had politely declined.\n\"You sure you can make it to the meeting before noon?\"\n\"Y-Yes, I have my way, so…\"\nAfter all, with Lynn's help, they can easily fly away with wind magic. It's much faster than riding in a carriage back to the academy.\n\"Thank you very much for everything.\"\nAs Monica bowed her head, hugging the book that had been bought for her, Felix gave her the same gentle, friendly smile that he always gave her at school. A smile which different from mischievous of Eig, but a smile of royalty that adored by everyone.\nThe time she's been spending with Eig was over. Now, the man before her was not the Felix Ark Ridill like before, but the second prince of this country.\n…Noble and distant.\n\"I'll see you then.\"\n\"Yes.\"\nThe carriage that Felix had boarded started to roll.\nMonica remained there watching the carriage go by until she could no longer hear the sound of its wheels. Eventually, a small yellow bird landed on Monica's shoulder. It was Lynn, a contracted spirit of Louis Miller.\n\"You have worked hard guarding the Second Prince, Miss [Silent Witch].\"\n.\"Y-yeah…\"\nCould I call that protection, wondered Monica as she smiled wryly inwardly. Since she had forgotten about the escort in the process, got swept up by Eig, and then became absorbed in reading. She was having fun.\nThe book in her arms and the peridot necklace, even if they were just his whims, was surely unforgettable memories for Monica.\nAs Monica was thinking about this, Lynn, in her little bird form, moved up to Monica's ear and whispered in her ear.\n\"I'd like to take you to the academy now, but before that, I have some bad news.\"\n\"Eh!?\"\nLynn told the news to the tense Monica.\n\"The infiltrated assassin in the chess tournament who'd been captured was…………..\"",

      "content": "\"A self-poisoning, huh?\" muttered Louis in a low voice, prompting the head warden sitting across from him to nod once with a pale face.\nWhat awaited Louis Miller when he returned home after leaving the mansion of the [Star Oracle Witch] was a report of the fake Pittman, the assassin who broke into Serendia Academy, which had killed himself with a hidden poison. Thus, even after having just returned home in the middle of the night, he flew with his flight spell to the prison and summoned the person in charge, after a bit of choking up of the guard who was speaking nonsense telling Louis to come back again in the morning since it's night now.\nThe middle-aged man who served as the chief warden of this prison trembled pathetically the moment he heard the Seven Sages had called him, which couldn't help but prompted him to answer Louis' question honestly.\n\"When did you find the body?\"\n\"Earlier this afternoon… a patrol guard found him.\"\n\"You said it was a self-poisoning, but did you find any eyewitness who saw him took the poison?\"\n\"N-No, sir. The cell across from it just happened to be empty…\"\n\"Have any of the other prisoners noticed anything unusual?\"\n\"There's no sign of it either…\"\nNodding his head with a \"hmm,\" Louis recalled in his mind the structure of the prison he had checked before coming here. Instead of facing each other, the cells in this prison were built to be next to each other, making it difficult for prisoners to check on each other's cell conditions.\n\"When you imprisoned that man, did you not check his belongings?\"\nThe warden's face turned beet red at Louis' question, causing him to refute in a desperate manner with his spits flying over.\n\"W-We did! We have checked it very carefully! That man certainly didn't bring any poison with him…\"\n\"But in reality, he was dead.\"\n\"W-Well… I…\"\nLouis considered a few cases in his mind before reaching two major possibilities. Either the imprisoned man was carrying poison by some means and committed suicide, or someone killed him to keep his mouth shut. Thinking that the latter seemed more likely, he asked the chief warden to show him the man's body.\nThe chief warden was getting nervous, but he still led Louis to the basement. Apparently, they were using one of the rooms in the basement as a morgue for the body.\nThe body lying on the floor was that of a man in his mid-twenties. He was told that his appearance, which resembled that of Minerva's teacher, Eugene Pittman, was not the result of any makeup or disguise. That was confirmed when he was captured.\nLooking at the way he dressed in his prison uniform was pretty crude. It bothered Louis.\n\"Chief Warden. Did you take off his clothes right after he died?\"\n\"N-no, not particularly, but I believe it remains exactly as it was when it was first discovered…\"\nThen it's strange\n, thought Louis, furrowing his brow. The way the prisoner's clothes were worn was a little too crude. The front and back of his pants were reversed, and it didn't reach all the way up to his waist.\n… it looks as if someone put it on him after he died.\nSuddenly, a possibility crossed his mind, and Louis thoroughly examined the condition of the body. He had some knowledge of autopsy, but admittedly, with the level of medicine in this country, it was difficult to determine the exact time of death.\n——Still, distinguishing between someone who has been dead for half a day and someone who has been dead for a few days was something he could do.\n\"Chief Warden, how was the real Eugene Pittman murdered?\"\n\"According to his statement, he took advantage of the fact that Eugene Pittman was on his way to Serendia Academy to participate in the chess tournament, and killed him by drowning him with water magic. He then stripped him and dumped him in the river…\"\n\"So, you still haven't found the body of the real Eugene Pittman?\"\nAfter seeing the Chief Warden nod, Louis was convinced.\nThe real Pittman was killed by drowning—that's the only information available to them from the killer's statement.\nWhat if Pittman had really been killed in a different way? …such as poisoning.\nLouis looked down at the body in front of him with a bitter look on his face.\n\"I am pretty sure that the cause of death of this body is poisoning. However, this is not a body that has been dead for half a day… this is the actual Eugene Pittman.\"\n\"…what?\"\n\"I presume they were using ice magic to prevent the body from decomposing.\"\nTurning his gleaming, razor-sharp eyes on the uncomprehending warden, Louis posed a single question.\n\"Have there been any outsiders in or out of the building today?\"\n\"N-now, that you mention it… there's a trader who delivers food to prisoners…\"\n\"That trader must be his accomplice. He/she probably carried the real Pittman's body into the cell, faked the fake Pittman's suicide, before letting him out.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nA covered wagon was moving down the street, despite the fact that it was late at night. A young girl with short black hair was seated in the driver's seat wearing a hooded cloak. Under the cloak was a fresh face with no makeup and eyebrows set in a dignified expression.\nJust then, a young man emerged from the wagon behind her. He gave the impression of calm, unreliable, and gentle—it was Eugene Pittman, Minerva's teacher… nay, it was the man who stole his face.\nKeeping her gaze forward, the woman opened her mouth.\n\"Yuan, please remain inside. There may be people who are already aware of your escape.\"\n\"Come on, Heidi, don't be so uptight. How about this, then?\"\nThe man called Yuan laughed in a sweet voice like burnt honey and covered his face with his hand. Then, as his fingers dug into the skin, the face that resembled Eugene Pittman contorted like squishy clay.\nIt might look like some clay was pasted onto the skin and then kneaded. However, if you look closely, you can see that this was not the case—the skin itself has been transformed into a clay-like substance. Despite the nauseating and horrifying scene that was unfolding nearby, Heidi did not change her expression. To her, this scene was nothing to be surprised about.\n\"Here, how about this?\"\nWhen Yuan put his hand off, his face looked exactly like Felix Ark Ridill, the second prince of the Ridill Kingdom, only with different colored hair and eyes.\nHeidi shifted her focus to stare at Yuan's face with one eye, then returned her gaze to the front.\n\"Yuan, please stop joking around.\"\n\"Okay, okay. Heidi, for someone so cute, you can't take a joke.\"\n\"… I'm sorry.\"\nHeidi lowered her dignified eyebrows with a slight shrug and lowered her head. She has an earnest personality that makes her blame herself for even the most trivial of things.\nYuan gave an exasperated, \"goodness,\" and hugged Heidi from behind.\n\"I'm not angry with you, okay? I do feel so lucky to have such a good ally like you. It's all thanks to you that I was able to escape from prison like this. Thank you.\"\nYuan then kissed the back of Heidi's head with a smooch sound.\nYuan was an excellent assassin who could infiltrate various places by manipulating his face at will, but all this was possible only with the support of Heidi.\nThey poisoned the real Eugene Pittman and preserved his body with ice magic to prevent it from decomposing. Then, after Yuan had safely completed his mission at Serendia Academy, he would fake his own suicide at a suitable place and have the preserved body found… That was the original plan.\nHowever, the boy, Barney or whoever he was, saw through him and caused Yuan to be apprehended. So he changed his plan and asked Heidi to sneak into the prison to replace Yuan's body with Pittman's.\n\"I was so close this time… oh, dear, all that stress could ruin my skin.\"\n\"Shall we return to the Empire after a short break in the hideout?\"\nYuan shook his head as he stayed in the position of hugging Heidi from behind.\n\"No, my work is not done yet. I plan to infiltrate at the Serendia Academy's school festival one more time.\"\nWith that said, Yuan squinted his eyes like a snake and licked his lips with a thin tongue.\n\"Still… there's something that's bothering me.\"\n\"You mean the ‘invisible magicians' who defeated you?\"\n\"Right.\"\nYuan closed his eyes and recalled the moment when he was knocked down.\nAnother female student arrived when he tried to silence Barney Jones, Minerva's student who discovered his true identity. Since it would be troublesome if that she screamed, he trapped her in a water ball barrier…\nFor some reason, the water ball barrier was broken. And somehow, he was crushed by wind magic and was stunned by lightning magic afterward.\nBut he didn't see anyone in the room who was reciting any spell. At that time, he had assumed that there were magicians hiding somewhere and were using remote spells to attack Yuan.\n…But what if it was not the case?\nThe water ball barrier that Yuan had set up felt as if it had been destroyed from the inside. What's more, the girl who looked so weak couldn't possibly destroy the barrier with her bare hands. If she wanted to destroy it from the inside, it would be appropriate to interfere with it with some spell.\nSince inside the water ball barrier was filled with water, she shouldn't able to recite a spell but… Was she carrying some kind of magic tool? Hmm, she never showed any signs of using any tools.\nWith a face that resembled Felix's, Yuan squinted his eyes and examined the situation over and over again. The more he examined it, the more he came to one conclusion.\nIn other words—there's something about that girl, Monica Norton.\nIf he were going to infiltrate Serendia Academy's school festival, that girl would probably be his biggest obstacle. In response to this premonition, Yuan's body trembled and his lips lifted into a crescent moon smile. With a throaty, sweet voice, he seemed to be enjoying himself from the bottom of his heart.\n\"Uhuhu, ahahahaha!\"\n\"You look so happy, Yuan.\"\n\"Of course I'm so happy. I'm so thrilled to look forward to this… I mean, I can smell stimulating secrets from it.\"\nYuan hugged Heidi from behind and nuzzled his face into her dark hair, letting out a chuckle. Then, like a cat approaching its prey, he licked his lips with a smile.\n\"My job is to expose people's secrets. Whether it's Felix Ark Ridill's secrets or Monica Norton's secrets…I'll expose them all.\"\n\"Yuan, there's a hard object hitting my waist.\"\n\"I love the look on their face when their secret is revealed. How wonderfully arousing. Especially when their face is beautifully twisted into a crumpled mess, it's like a virgin girl crying and begging \"please don't expose me, please don't expose me\" with her clothes ripped off!\"\n\"Yuan, there's a hard object hitting my waist.\"\n\"When we get to the hideout, will you keep me company?\"\n\"Sure, if that's what you want, Yuan.\"",

      "content": "When Monica returned to the attic of the girls' dormitory with Lynn's super-fast flying magic, Nero was wedged in the small gap between the wall and the closet. With his butt facing Monica.\n\"…U-Um, Nero?\"\nInstead of answering, his black tail tapped the floor with a plop. Oh, he was sulking.\n\"Geez, Nero, you really are…\"\nMonica muttered in a troubled tone, and Nero said, still tapping the floor with his tail.\n\"You left me behind to play all night, moreover you're staying over until morning?\"\n\"W-Well…\"\nMonica was at a loss hearing his response, but the woman who'd brought her here, Lynn, in her usual maid outfit opened her mouth.\n\"Certainly, Miss [Silent Witch]'s had a feast accompanied by handsome young men, after which, continued with having carnal lust with a handsome man in the brothel…\"\n\"Lyyyynnnn!?\"\nAs Monica peeled her eyes open, Nero coming out of the gap, tapping Monica's foot with his paw.\n\"You've disappointed me, Monica! You're hussy!\"\n\"Hussy!?\"\n\"How heartless of you! You should learn from Abram!\"\n\"Who's Abram, anyway?!\" shouted Monica, at which Nero snorted before pulling out a book. It was Nero's favorite adventure novel with Dustin Günther as its author.\nNero often mentioned how great Dustin Günther's book was. Dexterously turning up the page, he tapped the scene introducing the characters with his paw.\n\"Abram's a friend of the main protagonist Bartholomew, and he's a very good and loyal guy. Even when he's tempted by a beautiful woman, he says, \"For me, friendship is more valuable than love,\" and keeps his friendship with Bartholomew alive. It's so cool.\"\n\"Abram… Bartholomew…\"\nMonica had never read the novel, but she had a feeling of having heard its name somewhere. It was also rather recent.\n—You know, I'm currently writing a scene in my new novel about a foolish man who falls in love with a stage actress. And Abram, a friend of the main protagonist Bartholomew, who's in love with the stage actress Catherine says:\n\"Oh, I'd like to see her play again with my own eyes.\"\n…and your expression was exactly like that.\n\"…ah!?\nMonica's mouth gaped open as she cried out.\nNow that he mentioned it, didn't Felix say that Porter's an antiquarian bookstore owner and novelist?\nWhile Nero went on at length about how righteous and compassionate Abram is to the stunned Monica. The kind-hearted Monica decided to keep quiet about the development of Abram, who lives for friendship and is reduced to the stage actress adorer.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAfter getting herself ready, Monica decided to leave the girls' dormitory early with a little more time to spare.\nHaving been informed by Linn that the assassin who had infiltrated the chess tournament had escaped from the prison, she wanted to think of a countermeasure.\nAssuming that the man who had disguised himself as Minerva's teacher Eugene Pittman was also capable of impersonating another individual… which would be very troubling.\nNero can help her to sense any unusual mana activity. Lynn also can help her to eavesdrop on any suspicious conversations. But these things can be performed because very few people were present at the chess tournament.\nOn the other hand, a lot of people would come and go on the day of the school festival, so asking Lynn to pick up only suspicious conversations among them was almost an impossible task. In addition, some groups will be held magic presentations at the event, so it's doubtful that Nero will be able to detect any unusual mana activity.\nHe might be able to notice it immediately if it was mana from [Conch Flame] or like the time when Cyril's mana gone out of control, but it's unlikely he can detect magic that runs on a small scale.\nIf I keep staying by His Highness on the day of the school festival, he might think of me as a suspicious person.\nIn any case, the most reliable way is to give Felix a magic tool that has a defensive barrier function.\nIt was a move that'd been used once by Louis Miller—though the said magic tool was destroyed within three days after its creation.\n…Now that I think about it, that's also the reason I came undercover…\nRemembering the conversation at that time, Monica laughed helplessly and shoved her hands in her pockets. In her pocket was the magic tool that she had improvised this morning. It was a cheap brooch she bought in the entertainment district and applied a protective barrier to it after Lynn informed her of the assassin's escape.\nShe actually wanted to make it usable as many times as possible, not just a one-time disposable item. Including a function that would allow her to know when the barrier was activated, even if she was far away.\nHowever, in order to incorporate multiple functions, it would require her to take a long time to produce and a better gemstone, which was considered by its size and its purity.\nBut with only a cheap brooch within her options, all she could do was applying a simple formula to it.\n…but I've increased the strength of the barrier, so that should be enough to protect him when the worst-case scenario happens…\nThe question is, how would she give this brooch to Felix?\nShe wished he could keep it with him all the time, preferably unnoticed.\nThe magic tool that Monica made was a brooch made of amber on a poorly plated base. The size of the brooch is such that it can be held in Monica's hand and hidden.\nIf she put it in the pocket, he would notice it when he put his hands in. Even if she put it on the coat, he would notice it as well when he take his coat off. In any case, all of the students would change their uniform to that of noble's formal attire when the closing party's coming up.\nIf that's the case… should I hide it in his u-underwear? I suppose that's too far even for his safety… Hmm… Is there any other way… Uuuu… I can't think of any method…\nMonica wracked her brains as she walked.\nThe whole reason she left the dormitory a little early was to figure out how to make Felix keep this brooch, but at this rate, she would end up arriving at the school with no idea what to do with it.\nHaving all these thoughts in her mind had left her to forget her footing and overlook the slight budge in the ground. As expected, after her foot caught on it, she lost her balance and fell flat on the ground.\n\"Fugyaaaa!!\"\nIn the nick of time, she managed to bring her palms to hold the ground, avoiding falling on her face, but her palms still hurt.\n\"…my palm hurts…\" Monica stood snifflingly and continued with her way to the school totteringly without even noticed that the brooch was dropped when she's falling over.\nTo tell the truth, things that Monica overlooked were not only the dropped brooch. In fact, there was a female student walking a little behind Monica. The girl witnessed the whole thing until Monica fell down and dropped the brooch.\nIt was the Student Council Secretary Bridget Graham, a girl known as one of the three most beautiful ladies in the school. Having witnessed Monica dropped the amber brooch, she picked it up and lifted it to her eye level to stare at it.\nBy all appearances, it was a poorly made, cheap brooch. But if you look through it in the light, you can see a thin layer of magic formula floating in the amber stone.\n\"…………\"\nBridget took out a handkerchief, wrapped the brooch, then put it in her pocket, then proceeded to walk away as if nothing had happened.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nUnable to think of a good way to have Felix wear the brooch, Monica arrived at the student council room to find that Felix and Cyril had already arrived there.\n\"Morning, Monica.\" Unlike the time when he greets her as Eig, Felix greeted her with a gentle and kind prince's smile.\nMonica politely replied to Felix and Cyril as she bowed, while glancing at Felix's clothes. For some reason, Monica couldn't think of a way to sneak the brooch onto his perfectly dressed white uniform.\nMaybe I should just give it directly and ask him to put it on… But how should I ask him… What's the best line for asking so that His Highness will definitely be inclined to wear the brooch… Should I tell him, \"I want you, the exceptional fashionable person, to put this on\"… like that? But this brooch is too dull for an exceptional fashionable person… and it's designed for women in the first place…\nDrawing on all the wisdom she had accumulated ever since leaving the cabin to this day, Monica devised a way to make a request that would make Felix want to wear the brooch.\nThen, an idea crossed her mind. Right, the entertainment district had hinted her the way. This is it, this is the only way. This should be worked.\n…\"If you wear this brooch, it could bring you some fortunes\"… alright, let's go with that.\nBut it ended with a disappointing conclusion, which came from how Doris' trick to make men swoon over. It had a similar concept as to how uncle street vendor presenting their goods. Nevertheless, Monica was determined to get the brooch out of her pocket, as if this was a good idea…\n…Huh?\nNo matter how hard she rummaged through her pockets, she could not find the brooch. Even when checking the other pocket just to be sure, she still found no brooch.\nD-D-Don't tell me… it dropped at that time!?\nMonica flapped her jacket and skirt as she stomped her feet to check if the brooch was caught in the hem of her jacket or skirt. But the brooch still didn't come out.\n\"…Treasurer Norton, what are you doing?\"\nCyril stared at Monica's odd behavior, to which Monica replied with cold sweats running down, her eyes darting around.\n\"W-Well… you see… I… right, I'm practicing ballroom dance for the upcoming ball… I-I'm looking forward to the ball…\"\nIn response to her words, Cyril's eyes slightly widened. But, he immediately wrinkled his brow and grunted.\n\"…You're not going to tell me that those bizarre steps are a dance, are you? What were those training days for?\"\n\"I-I… O-O-Of course I remember… Look, one-two-three, one-two-three…\"\nMonica smiled tensely, as she did some ballroom dancing steps on the spot. And the way Cyril earnestly looking at her was so scary.\nJust then, the door opened with Bridget coming into the room. She greeted everyone at the entrance with a \"good day to you\" and gave a cold look to Monica, who was doing her dance steps.\nShe did not say anything more. As a matter of fact, Bridget didn't even try to talk to Monica, perhaps thinking it was not worth it.\nA while later, Neil and Elliot arrived, bringing all the student council members together, and Felix opened his mouth.\n\"Okay, I guess everyone's here. In tomorrow school festival starts tomorrow, let's make sure we have everything in place and do our best to make it a great day for everyone.\"\nWhat should I do? I can't give His Highness the best possible protection without that barrier magic tool…\nMonica inwardly clutched her head in anguish. Bridget was looking at her with a probing look, but of course, Monica didn't notice.\nAnd so, with a great deal of uncertainty, the Serendia Academy Festival was about to begin.",

      "content": "Cyril Ashley was not the kind of person who took the initiative to hold a tea party. But just two days before the school festival, he rented one of the private tea rooms in the school. Moreover, he only invited one person, and that's his sister Claudia Ashley. Both siblings were not the type who would have a friendly and harmonious chat at a tea party. In other words, he invited her to talk in private in the name of a tea party. Perhaps understanding this notion, Claudia quietly took a sip of her tea with a deeply annoyed expression on her beautiful face, and said,\n\"…so what do you want from me for having invited me here?\"\nCyril's glad he didn't have to make some pleasantries, as he himself had no intention of making idle chitchat, so he spoke briefly of his reasons for calling Claudia.\n\"Let me borrow your dress.\"\nClaudia was silent for a full ten seconds as she lifted her cup of tea. During this time, she didn't even blink, which made Cyril feel uneasy, as if he was talking to a wax figure.\nAfter having fully stirred up her brother's anxiety, Claudia said a few words.\n\"……I had no idea my dear brother had a thing for cross-dressing.\"\nCyril felt the urge to shout, but he held it in and said with a twitch in his cheek.\n\"Why is it assumed that I'm going to wear it?\"\n\"Oh, you haven't heard? Well, according to the voting held in the school secretly to decide the suitable person for the heroine of the festival play, the first Queen Amelia, Bridget Graham got the first place as a result… and you came in second.\"\n\"What!?\"\nHe had never heard any of it.\nSitting across from Cyril, who was in utter disbelief, Claudia smiled a meaningful and eerie smile that stirred up anxiety in the viewer.\n\"For your information, I got the third place… To be honest, I'm not even happy to be ranked in such a thing, but I couldn't stop laughing when I saw your name and mine lined up in second and third place.\" smiled Claudia beautifully but emotionlessly.\nCyril, who had no idea that such a vote was being held in secret, gritted his teeth.\nWell, whatever the result of the vote, student council members like Bridget and Cyril can't afford to be there on stage, and Claudia would never be in the play given her personality.\nIn the end, Miss Eliane, who was placed fourth, was chosen to play the role of queen. Eliane is a distant relative of Felix from his mother's side, and is one of the three most beautiful women in the school, along with Bridget and Claudia. Though she was somewhat of a dreamy, delicate, and fleeting girl, it would be another matter whether she was suitable for the role of Queen Amelia, which was a strong, noble, and wise woman.\n\"…So, could you tell me your reason for asking me to borrow my dress?\"\nAfter having given many sarcastic remarks to her brother, Claudia returned to the topic at hand with an indifferent look on her face.\nCyril himself did not want to continue with the current topic, so he cleared his throat lightly and told her the circumstances.\n\"Well, you see… I hope you could lend your dress to Treasurer Norton.\"\nStudents are expected to wear formal attire when attending the ball at the end of the school festival. Since no one participates in school uniform. However, given Monica's circumstances and personality, we can safely assume that she didn't own any dress. And as a member of the student council, she could not afford to be absent from the ball.\n\"If Treasurer Norton were to attend the ball in school uniform, it would be a disgrace to our student council, or in other words, to His Highness. And it's my duty as His Highness's right-hand man to make arrangements in advance so as not to embarrass His Highness…\"\n\"Students can borrow a dress from one of their classmates, so what I heard.\"\nAt Claudia's remark, Cyril stiffened for a moment, then drank his tea with a rather restless gesture, but then snorted haughtily.\n\"Then, my request won't be a problem for you, yes?\"\n\"Of course it will, there's no way my dress would fit on Monica… though it would look much better on you.\"\n\"………\"\nThe height difference between the tall Claudia even for a girl, and the petite Monica was too great. If anything, Cyril, who was slender despite being a boy, was closer to Claudia's size.\nIn secret, Cyril was disturbed by this notion as a blue streak popped up on his temple, but he kept his expression as if nothing happened before opening the lid of the sugar pot.\nClaudia watched him impassively and said.\n\"You know, I've been wondering, what made my dear brother, who would prefer death than having a tea party with me, had invited me to his tea party… I see… now I understand…\"\n\"I told you, this is to ensure the success of the school festival…\"\n\"You must have really wanted to see Monica in a dress.\"\nThe spoon and sugar inside the sugar pot spilled over into Cyril's teacup. But when the spoon almost dropped into the cup, he hurriedly put the spoon back into the sugar pot and glared at Claudia.\n\"A student council member is a role model for all students. That's why I've made the necessary arrangements so to uphold that goal…\"\nClaudia was no longer listening to Cyril as she took a bite of the cookie with a look of deep concern on her face, but when she looked at the vase of flowers on the table, she suddenly remembered something.\n\"That reminds me, is Neil…\"\n\"Why does the name of General Affairs Manager Maywood come up here?\"\n\"…What's wrong with me talking about my own fiancé? So, will Neil be busy this year?\"\n\"Of course he will.\"\nOn the day of the festival, Felix was probably the busiest person on the surface since he's to greet everyone, but if you think who's the busiest person behind the scenes, it was actually General Affairs Manager Neil.\nManaging supplies, arranging meals, and so on, and when there are problems that arise, he had to deal with them. Moreover, there are many other things to do, such as keeping in close contact with the heads of each department before sharing all those information with the student council members.\nOnce Cyril affirmed the obvious, Claudia lowered her long eyelashes and let out a sigh with a slightly depressed look on her face.\n\"…I see. I guess I won't get any flower this year either.\"\n\"Flower? Oh, you mean the custom giving floral ornaments.\"\nAt Serendia Academy, there's a custom of boys giving flower ornaments to girls during the school festival.\nA flower ornament represents the expression of \"I want you to be the first to dance with me at the ball,\" and if the girl who received the ornament wore it, it meant that she had accepted the invitation to dance.\nThe colors of the flowers and ribbons were often the same as the color of the giver's hair and eyes, so those who look at them can easily tell who gave them to them.\nThough it's not a mandatory event, most of the people who participated actually have already been engaged.\n\"…I didn't dance with Neil at the ball last year.\"\n\"Maywood General Affairs Manager is a very busy man, after all.\"\n\"…and I didn't even get a floral ornament.\"\n\"What does it matter? Flower ornaments are just an event for fun.\"\nClaudia tilted her head slightly with a doll-like blank expression. Her beautiful lapis lazuli eyes looked at her brother in a somewhat contempt manner.\n\"…you don't understand woman's heart at all.\"\nCyril fell silent, and Claudia mumbled to herself, hardly moving her mouth.\n\"…Do you know how a girl who hasn't received a floral ornament is looked at? …'A leftover who is not taken in by anyone.'\"\n\"That's just their assumptions. At least on the boys' side, they don't look at girls that way…\"\n\"Exactly, even if the boys don't think so, the girls just take it upon themselves to make assumptions about each other… deceitful, isn't it?\"\nCyril gulped as he felt the chill in Claudia's voice that sent shivers down his spine. Then he opened his mouth to cover up the fact that he was pressured by his sister.\n\"But, you… you'd received floral ornaments from a dozen people at last year's school festival.\"\nDespite the fact that she has a fiancé named Neil, there were always a number of people who come forward every year to claim that they are worthy of being Claudia's fiancé.\nClaudia's overwhelming beauty and brains must be coveted by those who want excellent and beautiful children. That's why the direct bloodline of the Marquis Highon household is highly regarded even within the kingdom.\nThose who think that they are more suitable to be Claudia's husband than the son of a humble baronet will flock to Claudia with flower ornaments on the day of the school festival.\n\"… I would never accept flowers from anyone but Neil.\"\nClaudia looked at Cyril with a look of deep contempt. Giving him a look of ‘you should not make me say something that is so obvious now.'\nCyril felt slightly awkward and cleared his throat.\n\"General Affairs Manager Maywood is an honest man. The only reason he didn't send you a floral ornament is probably that he was too busy to dance that day.\"\nClaudia probably knew that, too.\n\"I guess so,\" she muttered shortly, her lapis lazuli eyes looking idly outside. And then, as if talking to herself, she murmured.\n\"Actually, I neither like nor dislike you, but…\"\n\"Now, that's out of the blue.\"\n\"If I had to pick one, I'd say I like Neil.\"\nCyril snorted haughtily and took a sip of his sweet tea.\n\"It's just that their eyes are too blind to see the capabilities of General Affairs Manager Maywood.\"\n\"Yes, they are,\" muttered Claudia in an unusual gentle voice.\nAs he sipped his tea, Cyril thought of a certain girl.\nStudent Council Treasurer Monica Norton was the cause of Cyril's concern. Does she also want a flower ornament from someone? Would she be feeling miserable if no one gave her a flower ornament?\n…no, I doubt Treasurer Norton would want to dance in the first place.\nCyril's concerns were unfounded, of course.\nMonica, who hated to be seen in public and was not good at dance, would hardly want to dance at a ball.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThe day before the school festival, Monica Norton arrived at the student council room, but she seemed to be acting strangely. She suddenly flapped her clothes on the spot and performed a bizarre step.\n\"…Treasurer Norton, what are you doing?\"\nCyril gave her a stare, and Monica stiffly responded with a smile.\n\"W-Well… you see… I… right, I'm practicing ballroom dance for the upcoming ball… I-I'm looking forward to the ball…\"\nThose words shocked Cyril from the bottom of his heart.\nThat Treasurer Norton was interested in the dance! Not only was she interested in dancing, but she was also looking forward to it!\nHe had thought she would never be interested in the ball, but, could it be… no wait, come to think of it, Monica was wearing makeup on the day of the chess tournament. Maybe she has become interested in those things that normal girls like to do.\nThat in and of itself was not a bad thing. It's not a bad thing, but…why did he feel bothered? And so much of it.\nAs if to deceive his bewilderment, Cyril raised his eyebrows and stared at Monica.\n\"…You're not going to tell me that those bizarre steps are a dance, are you? What were those training days for?\"\n\"I-I… O-O-Of course I remember… Look, one-two-three, one-two-three…\"\nAfter saying that, Monica tried to do some dance steps on the spot. It was a terrible step. The steps he taught her a while ago were a little better…\n…Ah, now I understand.\nCyril realized what was bothering him.\nIf Monica performed badly at the dance ball, it would be a disgrace to the student council. The thought of it had made him feel uneasy. That's why it bothered him so much. That must be it. It had to be.\nTherefore, he thought of a simple solution.\nIf I or His Highness take the lead, Treasurer Norton's dance will be a little better… but I can't trouble His Highness with this, so it's only logical for me to look after her.\nSo Cyril concluded, and the fuzziness in his chest cleared up. But he didn't seem to notice, that Neil was looking at him strangely as he began to work in a very good mood.",

      "content": "As a high-ranking wind spirit, Lynn's flight spell works by moving a semi-spherical barrier she created. To put it another way, it's like riding in a small invisible carriage, which's why it can move several people at once.\nAnd now, sitting on one knee in such semi-spherical barrier that moving through the sky was Louis Miller, silently reading a book.\nAt first glance, he may look like a strange person reading a book hovering in midair while moving at high speed, but there's no one using flight spell in the vicinity, and fortunately, only the birds in the sky were watching this scene.\nIt would take several hours to reach their destination, even with Lynn's flight spell. The ever-busy Louis didn't like to waste time, so he used the travel time to read.\n\"You sure read some imposing book, Sir Louis. Whom do you intend to curse and kill?\"\nWhile keeping her body facing forward to maintain the flight barrier, Lynn turned her head around to look at Louis. Lynn may have been trying to imitate human gestures, but to Louis, it looked like an owl turning its head. To put it simply, it was uncanny.\n\"This is not some sort of spellbook. And keep in mind that I don't curse people I don't like, I beat them up directly.\"\n\"That book doesn't seem to be written in this country's language.\"\n\"It's a book written by the Empire, after all.\"\nAfter saying that, Louis flipped through the pages.\nWhat he was reading now was a book concerning medical spell, a subject that was banned and restricted in this country. This book was also not allowed to be taken out by the general public, but he had taken it out with the authority of the Seven Sages.\n\"Lynn, I assume you have seen with your own eyes the assassin who broke into the chess tournament.\"\n\"Indeed.\"\n\"Did the assassin who was pretending to be Eugene Pittman use any kind of illusion?\"\nLynn was silent for a moment as she thought about it, and then did the dexterous trick of shaking her head in a position with her head still turned back.\n\"No, that assassin might be a magician, but he didn't use any kind of illusion.\"\nThe guards who had arrested the assassins had also confirmed this, so there was no doubt about it.\nAfter all, using an illusion spell to create some deceptive image in the surrounding was very inefficient, in terms of mana usage. Louis himself may be able to maintain the illusion for a few tens of seconds, but to constantly maintain the illusion for several hours is first and foremost impossible with the amount mana humans have.\nThe only beings who were capable of impersonating others through illusion are those high-ranking water spirits who were good at this kind of spell. And the assassin who killed Eugene Pittman was not a spirit, but a human.\nAs Louis held the page he was reading with his fingers and fixed his misaligned monocle, he muttered to himself.\n\"The way that man impersonated Eugene Pittman… it was neither an impersonator nor a disguise. It wasn't any kind of illusion as well. The only thing I can think of is… body manipulation spell.\"\nBody manipulation spell refers to the art of pouring mana into a person's body to strengthen or change the body.\nOriginally, the purpose of this spell was to heal damaged bodies, such as returning altered organs to their normal form, but if it could transform damaged organs and skin, it would not be impossible to change the shape of a face.\nHowever, body manipulation spell is considered forbidden magic——except in one country.\n\"Body manipulation spell has been lifted as part of medical magic in the Empire. If that's the case, there's a good chance that the assassin… is someone from the Empire.\"\nCasey Groove's attempted assassination of the second prince using the [Conch Flame] was related to the Randall Kingdom, a small country between the Ridill Kingdom and the Empire. And the assassin at the chess tournament had shown him the tail of the shadow of the Empire.\nThese two incidents that occurred in such a short period of time caused Louis to develop certain concerns. And to ascertain it, he had come all the way to the frigid north.\nThe scenery spread out below was speckled with white. A chilly wind may still be blowing in the capital, but in this area, snow has already begun to fall. And in the middle of the snow-covered mountains, far from human habitation, laid an old monastery on slightly open land.\n\"Sir Louis, I've come up with an innovative landing method unique to this land, may I try it?\"\nHearing that suggestion from the beautiful maid, Louis frowned before glaring at Lynn.\n\"You want to release your flight spell in midair and use the snow as a cushion to land on?\"\n\"It's as you say.\"\n\"Are you a child who gets excited by snow? Stick to the safe landing.\"\n\"Oh, that's a shame.\"\nLynn responded with an impassive expression that didn't look the least bit disappointed, and slowly lowered her altitude.\nIn front of the monastery, a young sister was shoveling snow with a shovel in her hand. The sister was not surprised to see Louis coming down from the sky. She just held her hands over her eyes to look at Louis and Lynn.\nLanding quietly on the snow, Louis stared back at the sister who was looking at him, then gave her a \"now, that's a surprise\" response with a thin smile.\n\"I thought you were a very composed sister who wasn't surprised to see flight magic, but… it was you, huh.\"\n\"I guess compared to the shock of crashing into the ground while spinning, it's kind of cute.\"\nHaving said that, the daughter of Count Bright, Casey Groove, thrust her shovel into the snow at her feet.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThe elderly sister in charge of the monastery ordered Casey to show Louis and the others around and then retreated into the chapel, wanting nothing to do with them.\nFor these women who live away from the world, visitors from the outside—especially a man like Louis—are probably not welcomed.\nThe same seemed to be true for Casey, as she began to talk after having guided Louis and Lynn into the parlor without offering them any tea.\n\"So, what do you want from me? I think I've told you pretty much everything I can.\"\nLouis responded to Casey's brusque attitude with a mature smile.\n\"There's something I wanted to ascertain.\"\n\"Our people had nothing to do with that assassination attempt. It was something my father and I did on our own.\"\n\"You could believe whatever you think, at least… although your father seems to think otherwise.\"\nCasey's mouth quivered at Louis' indirect remark. Louis took out a wrapped cloth from his pocket and gently unfolded it on the table. What laid within the cloth were the remnants of red stones of various sizes.\n\"Do you recognize what this is?\"\n\"…the remnants of the [Conch Flame] I used.\"\nInstead of correcting her, Louis smiled and continued with his words.\n\"Your father claimed to have bought it from a traveling peddler, but I suspect that someone from the Randall Kingdom gave it to your father.\"\n\"…are you saying that the people of Randall had instigated my father?\"\n\"Do you have any idea how much the [Conch Flame] costs? Forgive me, but it's not something the not-so-wealthy Count Bright can easily afford.\"\nMagical tools can be very costly. And with a high level of perfection at that, it's not something that the Count Bright household can easily get their hands on. When there are so many cheaper ways to assassinate someone, why did Count Bright choose the [Conch Flame]? It's more plausible to believe that someone gave Count Bright the [Conch Flame] and instigated him to do so.\nCasey was probably thinking about this possibility too. As she bit her lip with a grim face and tried her best to contain her agitation so that she would not say anything that could be used against her father.\nLooking at the resilient figure, Louis picked up one of the pieces of red stone and held it up to the light.\n\"The ruby used in this [Conch Flame] is extremely pure. I had it authenticated by an expert, and he said that it must have come from Glocken.\"\n\"…Glocken?\"\n\"You haven't heard of it? It's a mine in the southeastern part of the Empire. The amount of ore mined is not very large, but it yields high-quality rubies that are ideal for making magical tools… but the Empire exports very little of the ore from the said mine, so it's difficult to find on the market.\"\nLouis put the red stone back on the table with a clatter. The ringing sound echoed rather loudly in the serene monastery. Louis narrowed his gray-purple eyes and looked at Casey.\n\"The [Conch Flame] that Count Bright entrusted to you is made in the Empire. Do you know what this implies?\"\nCasey immediately turned pale at those words. Clever girl.\nWith that single statement, she speculated one frightening possibility.\nIf the person who gave Count Bright the [Conch Flame] was assumed to be someone from Randall, the next question would be where did the Randall person get the Empire's Conch Flame?\nThis brought her to one hypothesis. And that was…\n\"It's possible that the Randall Kingdom and the Empire are working together behind the scenes.\"\nA war between the Ridill Kingdom and the allied forces of the Empire and the Randall Kingdom could very well happen in the future. Casey must have finally understood this realization, as she clenched her fists tightly in her lap, but then opened her mouth with her head lowered.\n\"…As far as I know, I've never seen anyone from the Empire entering or leaving my hometown. The only people who frequented my household were Randall nobles whose names even I knew.\"\n\"Have you ever seen of your father sending letters to the Empire?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"…I see.\"\nIt would have been nice to get some evidence of the connection to the Empire here, but from her testimony, that was not going to be that easy.\nIf the Empire and Randall were somehow tied together, the Empire, with its overwhelming national power, would obviously be the \"master\" of the master-slave alliance. There was also a possibility that the nobles at the far end of Randall were unaware of the relationship between their country and the Empire.\nThere's no end to the \"what ifs,\" but it's always better to remain cautious of the shadow of the Empire.\n\"I guess there's no more information I can squeeze out of you. Since there seems to be no sign of tea being served, I guess I will take my leave soon.\"\nAs Louis rose from his chair, Casey gave him a short word of \"wait\" to stop him.\nLouis turned his disinterested eyes to Casey. He was a fairly busy person and disliked wasting his time. And he didn't think he could have anything more meaningful to say to this girl.\n\"…is Monica doing well?\"\nSure enough, what Casey mentioned was not something worthwhile for Louis.\n\"That's a topic that's less important than the weather if I would say. Well, she's been caught up in a fight with an assassin recently, but still living vigorously, more or less.\"\nCasey gulped, widened her eyes at the mention of having fought an assassin.\n\"…I still can't believe it, honestly. I can't believe Monica is the Seven Sages. I mean, she just seemed like a normal girl.\"\n\"[SIlent Witch] is a normal girl?\"\nLouis couldn't help but chuckle.\nEven after seeing Monica used no-chant magic, Casey still didn't have a clear understanding of Monica.\nLouis sat back in his chair and gave a cruelly beautiful sneer.\n\"Do you remember the \"Black Dragon of Wogan\" incident six months ago?\"\n\"…yeah, Silent Witch… I mean Monica had chased away the Black Dragon that appeared in Count Kerbeck's territory.\"\nCount Kerbeck's territory and Count Bright's territory are relatively close to each other, so that incident was probably no stranger to her. Even more so when the Black Dragon was an existence that gave despair to her people.\nThe flames breathed out by the Black Dragon, or [Black Flame], were unusual flames that burn away even magical barriers. Even for Louis, who's also known as the Dragon Slayer, dealing with that incident was not a simple matter.\n\"I was the one who dragged Miss [Silent Witch] to defeat the Black Dragon. You see, that little girl was whimpering and saying, ‘scary, scary…' when I did so.\"\nCasey looked at Louis in astonishment as he blithely confessed his outrageous deed.\n\"Don't you feel that way too? Yeah, I have some fears, too, you know. But what do you think Monica Everett, the Silent Witch, was afraid of?\"\nAt that time, in a sobbing voice, Monica said to Louis:\n\"—\"Those people of Dragon Knights so scary! Surrounded by so many people I don't know, so scary!\" is what she said. That little girl was never even a little bit afraid of the Black Dragon. She, the [Silent Witch] of the Seven Sages, was afraid of the Dragon Knights—humans who came to defeat it.\"\nIt's quite funny, isn't it? Louis whispered, but Casey seemed stunned into silence.\nLooking at her reaction, Louis cast a pitying glance at Casey.\n\"She fears and hates humans from the bottom of her heart… and that's why she can be as cruel as it takes. She's more twisted and heartless than you think.\"\nThat's why Louis chose Monica as his helper in the mission to escort the second prince.\n\"Don't expect her to have any sympathy for you.\"\nLouis told him sarcastically, and Casey stood up from her chair with a clatter. Then stormed out of the room, before quickly returning with a mug and a small package in her hand.\nCasey slammed the mug of tea down in front of Louis and pushed the paper package to him.\n\"I've been hesitating whether to give this to her or not, but your words have made up my mind… please give this to Monica. You don't have to mention my name.\"\nLouis didn't ask about her consent but when he looked at the contents of the paper package, his eyes widened. Casey must have been very upset with what Louis had said since she's been glaring at Louis with sharp eyes.\n…It would be easier if you hated her.\nWhat a foolish and soft-hearted girl.\nLouis let out a sigh in secret and tucked the paper package into his pocket. He then sipped his mug of tea with an elegant gesture and said.\n\"I suppose I'll do enough work for this cup of tea… by the way, do you have any sugar or jam?\"",

      "content": "The morning of the school festival arrived with a situation that could hardly be described as perfect. Monica got up from the bed and took out the coffee pot for the first time in a long time to make a coffee. A cup of coffee was a ritual for Monica to refresh her mind. While blowing on the hot coffee to cool it down, Monica glanced at Nero.\nNero was still sleeping in his bed, muffled. It's been so cold lately that Nero, who's sensitive to the cold, has become completely sluggish. When Monica had finished her coffee and changed into her uniform, Nero finally crawled out of bed with a muffled cry.\n\"The freezing cold stings… I want to hibernate…\"\n\"You know, it's a lot warmer here than in the mountain cabin.\"\nWhile responding to Nero, Monica opened a drawer in her desk. In the only locked drawer, Monica's treasures were inside. There was a coffee pot, a ribbon and a letter from Lana, a peridot necklace, and her father's book given to her by Felix—Eig.\nAt first, it was nothing but a coffee pot, but before she knew it, the contents of the drawer had grown considerably, which made Monica feel a little emotional.\n…ever since I came to this school, I've gained a lot of important things.\nWhen she first came to this school, all she cared about were her father's coffee pot and Nero. And yet, right now, there are so many things she doesn't want to lose, so many things she doesn't want to be taken away, so many people she doesn't want to be hurt.\n…I will protect all of them… For I am the Seven Sages, the Silent Witch.\nTelling herself that, Monica picked up her favorite ribbon and tied her hair up.\nJust then, there was a knocking at the window. Opening the window pane, a beautiful woman in a maid's uniform—Lynn—fluttered over the window frame and walked in.\n\"Good morning, Miss Silent Witch.\"\n\"Good morning, Lynn. Aren't you going to be a little bird today?\"\nWhen Lynn came in through the window, she often disguised herself as a small bird to avoid being spotted. This is rather unusual, Monica wondered, and Lynn nodded her head.\n\"Yes, there was something I wanted to deliver.\"\n\"…………?\"\n\"But first, let's discuss our plans for today.\"\nLynn called it a meeting, but in reality, there was not much to discuss.\nIt's basically the same as in the chess tournament. Lynn and Nero will disguise themselves as a little bird and a cat, respectively, and mark Felix thoroughly. Monica pretends to be a student as usual, and Louis pretends to be a guest at the school festival and constantly keeps an eye on the school. That's it.\nNero looked up at Monica, yawning with a tension-free.\n\"Well, let's not be too rigid and just go about our business as usual. It's a school festival, right? It would be a shame if we didn't enjoy it.\"\n\"…Nero, you are absolutely NOT allowed to take human form today, you understand?\"\nRemembering the incident at the chess tournament, Monica gave him a nudge, but Nero looked away and wagged his tail as if to play a fool.\nMonica scooped Nero up in her arms and stared at him.\n\"Ne.ro.?\"\n\"All right, all right, I got it! I'll be a good little kitty today!\"\nRepeating her warning to Nero, Monica glanced at Lynn.\n\"…you too, Lynn. Please try not to barge in as a human.\"\n\"Yes, today I'm a cute little bird.\"\nSo long as she persistently nudges them, things should be fine. Maybe.\nIf Nero and Lynn guard His Highness thoroughly, they should be able to handle it as long as it doesn't go too badly.\nIn fact, it would be safer if Felix can hold the barrier magic tool that she improvised. However, she was unable to find the magic tool brooch she had dropped yesterday. Remembering her own carelessness, Monica let out a sigh, and then Lynn said quietly.\n\"Miss [Silent Witch], please enjoy the school festival in moderation so that the Second Prince will not be suspicious of you.\"\n\"…I'm sorry for making it sound like I'm the only one who enjoys it.\"\n\"Please don't mind me. It is quite fun to pretend to be a bird and eavesdrop on human conversations.\"\n\"………\"\n\"Oh, and while you're at it, let me give you this.\"\nAs she said this, Lynn suddenly started flapping the skirt of her maid's uniform. Then a white box fell out of her skirt with a thud. What kind of trick did she use to have that kind of setup?\nAs Monica stood in shock, Lynn held out the box to her at her own pace.\n\"I heard that you are planning to borrow a dress from a friend for today's ball.\"\n\"Uh, yeah…\"\n\"Sir Louis told me, ‘Why didn't she just ask me to provide a dress for her? Well, I guess let me at least prepare your shoes for you'.\"\n\"A-ha ha… sorry.\"\nMonica had a wry smile on her face and opened the box she had received from Lynn.\nInside the box was a pair of white shoes with a pretty ribbon attached.\n\"Oh, this is so cute! …Huh?\"\nTaking out a pair of shoes, she found a note on the bottom of the box, written in Louis' familiar handwriting.\n\"Give me back my handkerchief, you stupid girl.\"\n\"…………\"\nCome to think of it, during the incident of the assassination attempt by Casey, she borrowed a handkerchief from Louis and forgot to return it afterward.\nMonica hurriedly opened a drawer, took out a cleaned and ironed handkerchief, and presented it to Lynn.\n\"Oh, um, please give this to Louis… and tell him I'm sorry it took me so long to return this…\"\n\"I did receive it. Now, please accept this instead.\"\nLynn took a small paper package from the pocket of her maid's uniform and held it out to Monica. What is it? Monica wondered as she opened the package and found a handkerchief with beautiful flowers embroidered on it.\n…Did Louis make this? Hmm, I guess not… wait, I've seen this before.\nMonica had seen those beautiful embroidery designs before.\n——\"Casey, your handkerchief is so beautiful.\"\n——\"Haha, thanks. I embroidered this myself.\"\n——\"Eh!? You made all these detailed patterns by yourself!?\"\n——\"I'm good at embroidery. I am going to make some for the bazaar at the school festival. Do you want me to make one for you, too?\"\n——\"Eh? But, I…\"\n——\"Feel free, no pressure!\"\nAs Monica clutched the handkerchief as she lowered her face down, Lynn said plainly with a blank expression.\n\"The giver said to be anonymous.\"\n\"……….\"\n\"This is just me talking to myself, but… she was shoveling the snow with so much enthusiasm.\"\n\"…it's just like her.\"\nMonica stared at the handkerchief with a crying smile on her face. There are so many colors of flower embroidery. But among them, yellow flowers are the most common.\n——\"Yellow flowers are a symbol of happiness in my hometown. We also give yellow flowers to brides.\"\nThe bright smile on Casey's face as she said those words came to mind.\n…I've got another treasure.\nWith a girlish smile on her innocent face, Monica hugged her brand new shoes and embroidered handkerchief to her chest with a heart full of happiness.",

      "content": "Below the clear, pleasant blue color stretched across the sky, dozen people from noble families disembarked one after another from the carriages after arrived at the perimeter of Serendia Academy before they're passing through the gate. As Monica watched the scene from the window of the school building, she clenched her fists in tension. Finally, the school festival had begun.\nWhen it comes to the day of the school festival, Minerva has a strong image of students running around busily, but Serendia Academy's festival has a completely different atmosphere, especially since it's a school for the children of noble families.\nSerendia Academy mainly held several events such as exhibitions, research presentations, musical performances, shows, plays, etc., but since the servants handle most of the behind-the-scenes work and chores, the students who are not involved in the actual stages and presentations usually have much free time.\nSo what do the other students who are not on stage do? They entertain the guests.\nThose who had family members visiting were enjoying family time together after being away for a long time, while those who were thinking of serving the royal family were busy promoting themselves.\nMonica, who had nothing to do with either of them, was currently following Felix in his inspection route, keeping a certain distance between them in case of emergency. She had a general idea where Felix's inspection route would be, so all she had to do was to avoid being in his sight as much as possible while remaining alert to her surroundings.\nAs she walked down the hallway, she saw Felix entering the classroom ahead of her. Apparently, he was inspecting the Historical Society's exhibit.\nPeeking quietly into the classroom, she discovered that Felix was chatting with several nobles. Entertaining the guests was also his job.\nGuess he'll be in this classroom for a while now…\nShe didn't want to accidentally bump into Felix when he came out of the classroom, so she stayed in one corner of the hallway and pretended to look at the exhibits.\nThe walls were covered with posters of plays that will be taking place in the outdoor theater. After all, it was the highlight of the school festival. Virtually all the students in the school would come to see this play. Of course, Felix would be there to watch the play from a special seat.\nI still have plenty of time before the play starting… maybe I should check around the stage for anything suspicious.\n\"Excuse me, are you Miss Monica Norton?\"\nA voice came out suddenly from behind her, making Monica's shoulders jolt.\nMonica turned around, wondering who exactly it was, but then her eyes widened to the limit.\nStanding behind Monica was a young man with a large build, black hair, black eyes to match, which exuded a dignified air.\nIt was Roberto Vinkel, a student from the [Temple], whom Monica had played against in a chess tournament and who had asked her for her engagement based on chess.\nThe school festival at Serendia Academy generally requires an invitation. Without it, they cannot attend the festival. So, why was he here?\nRoberto looked closely at Monica's flabbergasted face and nodded his head as if he was convinced of something.\n\"I knew it, you are Miss Monica. Your vibe is different from the last time I saw you, so I was wondering what would I do if I mistook you for someone else.\"\nCome to think of it, on the day of the chess tournament, she wore makeup and had a different hairstyle. It was natural that Roberto, who didn't know the usual Monica, would be confused.\n\"I think your outfit today also looks good, it's quite fresh and clean.\"\n\"T-Thank you…\"\nMonica gave an awkward laugh and took a step back. But behind her was a wall with posters on it. Which's why her thin back easily hit the wall.\nAs Monica tried to move away, Roberto took a step closer with a big stride.\n\"I really wanted to see you again, so I force myself to accompany my teacher as his entourage…\"\nGenerally, the invitations were also distributed to the teachers of the neighboring schools. After all this time, Monica realized that there was a possibility that Minerva teachers and professors she knew were coming, and that fact made her pale quickly.\nI-I knew I should have asked Lana to do my makeup…!\nLana had promised to help her with the dress and some make-up for the ball in the evening. But she felt bad if she also asks her help during the morning festival and refrained from doing so. Now she regretted it.\nAs Monica was holding her head inwardly, Roberto took another step closer.\nMonica's body began to tremble as she realized how close they were, too close for mere acquaintances to be talking face to face. She felt like a cornered little animal.\n\"Have you given any thought to my proposal the other day?\"\n\"W-W-W-W-What proposal…?\"\n\"An engagement.\"\nOf course, she hadn't given any thought to it.\nHer whole day during the chess tournament was filled with thoughts of how to deal with when encountering Barney and guarding Felix. To be honest, she had almost forgotten about Roberto.\n\"I-I… I don't intend to get an engagement, so…\"\n\"If there are any inconveniences, please don't hesitate to let me know. I will take care of it to the best of my ability. I will do everything in my power to make you happy.\"\nThere was no way she could say, \"I'm the Seven Sages in infiltration, so I can't get engaged or anything.\nTo the mumbling Monica, Roberto urged her to be as honest as she could be.\n\"I've never seen anyone play chess like you, and Professor Redding told me that you've just started playing chess. If that's the case, then you have a lot of room to grow… why don't you join me in my quest to become a better chess player?\nFor Monica, although chess is fun, it's only a part of her elective course. She has no plans to dedicate her life to it.\n\"B-But… I-I…\"\nWhat should she say to convince Roberto to back off? But she had a feeling that no matter what she said, she would be forcefully debunked.\nThe tension and confusion made Monica's blood run cold as her eyes began to moisten.\nShe knew that Roberto had no ill intentions, but for Monica, who was bad at facing people, the intimidating Roberto was very frightening.\nThe large figure standing in front of her overlapped with her uncle's figure from the past. The figure of a large person looking down at her where he swung his fist down.\nScary, scary, scary, scary, scary.\nJust as she was about to unconsciously protect her head with her hand, she heard the sound of someone's footsteps.\n\"Roberto Vinkel. Professor Redding's been looking for you near the school gate.\"\nWhen Monica looked toward the voice, out of the corner of her eye she saw a person with stunning platinum blonde with deep blue eyes approaching swiftly towards them. It was Cyril Ashley, the vice president of the student council.\nCyril stepped in between Roberto and Monica before looking coldly at Roberto.\n\"Treasurer Norton is a member of the student council and is very busy during the school festival. I would appreciate it if you could schedule your personal business for another day.\"\n\"Oh, I didn't know that. I'm sorry.\"\nRoberto nodded with a sincere look on his face, gave a formal \"See you later,\" and left at a quick pace.\nAs she watched his back, Monica let out a deep breath of relief. If it hadn't been for Cyril, she would have crouched down on the spot.\nMonica took a few deep breaths to regulate her erratic breathing and then looked up at Cyril.\n\"Um… Lord Cyril…\"\n\"…………\"\nCyril silently stared at Monica. He looked like he was in a bad mood, which made Monica cower. He was probably upset because of all the trouble she had gotten him into.\n\"I-I'm sorry, for causing trouble in your busy schedule, Lord Cyril.\"\n\"…………\"\nAs expected, Cyril kept looking at Monica's face in silence, but now with his brow wrinkled.\nAs Monica fidgeted restlessly and kneaded her fingers, Cyril suddenly held out one hand in front of Monica. In his hand, he held a white rose with a blue ribbon as a flower ornament.\nMonica rounded her eyes and looked alternately at Cyril's face and the flower ornament, but for some reason, Cyril looked away and said,\n\"Wear this on your clothes somewhere.\"\n\"…? A flower? …come to think of it, I saw other people wearing them, too…\"\nMonica had noticed here and there that mainly female students were wearing flower ornaments in their hair or on the chest of their uniforms. Was this a part of the school festival events?\nWhen Monica looked at the flower ornament curiously, Cyril appeared a little surprised.\n\"What, you haven't heard of flower ornament?\"\n\"Is this some kind of event?\"\n\"…well, it's fine if you haven't.\"\nCyril said plainly when Monica tilted her head. But in the meantime, his gaze wandered restlessly to his feet.\nLooking at his behavior, which for some reason looked nervous, Monica couldn't help but widened her eyes, but then saw Cyril lifted his slender chin as he usually did and pointed to the flower ornament.\n\"It's a charm that will prevent you from getting disgraced for today. You should wear it on when you go to the ball.\"\n\"T-To think this charm has that kind of effect…\"\nMonica was impressed by the flower ornament in her hand and looked down at it.\nThe white rose ornament did not seem to have any magic formula in it. This was probably referring to a customary or folkloric charm, not a magic charm.\nShe's not sure what the meaning of this flower ornament was, but it was said that wearing this ornament would save her from getting disgraced for today. What a revolutionary charm!\nLooking at the flower ornament again, Monica couldn't help but smile at the soft scent emanated from the white roses.\nWhat a beautiful flower…\nEven for her, receiving a flower-like ‘charm' like this from someone was a first.\n\"Thank you for giving me such a beautiful flower, Lord Cyril!\"\nCyril's mouth lifted slightly when he saw the loosened Monica's face turned into a smile, before giving her a small, satisfied nod.",

      "content": "Cyril, who was very busy, seemed to have other work to do and quickly left the area after that. In normal situations, Cyril often accompanied Felix, and this should have been the original plan, perhaps something unexpected had happened?\nFeeling bad that she couldn't help Cyril, Monica turned her focus back to Felix and saw him left the exhibition classroom accompanied by several nobles. He was apparently leading the nobles to another exhibit class.\n\"Miss [Silent Witch]. Please be careful not to get too close to the second prince.\"\nShe was hearing Lynn's voice directly in her ears. Probably she's vibrating the sound directly into Monica's eardrums like she did in the entertainment district.\n\"I discovered this during our time in the entertainment district. The second prince has a very keen instinct towards his pursuer. Fortunately, the place he's heading to seems to be a room with a window, so I can monitor him from the top of the tree. If I see anyone suspicious approaching, I will report it to you, and please keep it at a reasonable distance.\"\nMonica was never good at tailing people, and it would be better to follow Lynn's lead here. Otherwise, it would be just another example of what happened in the entertainment district.\nEver since the incident at the chess tournament that had happened, the security in the academy had been strengthened, and there were guards posted all over the place. The security was so thorough that it was doubtful that Monica needed to be vigilant.\nI don't want to get too close to His Highness and cause him to think I'm suspicious… yeah, I guess I should watch my distance.\nAfter confirming that Felix had entered the classroom, Monica moved a short distance away from it. Just then, she caught sight of Lana walking around the corner of the corridor and coming towards her.\nWhen Lana noticed Monica, she ran up to her, waving her hand. Upon arriving, she noticed the white rose ornament on Monica's chest, before giving her a meaningful smile.\n\"Oh… I see I see…\"\n\"Hmm? Is there something wrong?\"\n\"Yup, I'll make you look even prettier at the ball, so look forward to it.\"\nLana seemed to be enjoying herself. Monica nodded vaguely, not understanding why Lana seemed to be in a good mood, before asking her how she fared herself.\n\"Lana, are you done with your final costume check?\"\n\"Yes, everything is perfect. Anyway, my father's carriage should be arriving any minute, so I'm heading out to pick him up. Do you want to come with me? I wish to introduce you to my father.\"\nLana's father, Baron Colette, is said to be an astute merchant who has amassed an enormous fortune. However, since he was not a person who frequented the palace, he must not have known Monica's face.\nAs Monica wondered if it was safe to meet him, Lana's face suddenly tightened. Her eyes narrowed sharply, and her brow wrinkled. Monica followed Lana's gaze, wondering what was going on, and let out an ‘ah' in a small voice.\nStanding in front of Lana's line of sight was a student of Minerva's who was once Monica's friend. Barney Jones.\nBarney looked at Lana and Monica in turn then opened his mouth, lifting his glasses with his fingertips.\n\"Oh, you're not wearing makeup today? I guess that's more like you.\"\nEven though Barney's tone was stinging, she feel it was somewhat awkward.\nLana tightened her grip on Monica's hand as she glared at Barney.\n\"Monica, let's go.\"\n\"L-Lana, wait…\"\nMonica was thankful that Lana was concerned about her, but she had something she really wanted to talk to Barney about.\nAfter all, she hadn't spoken to Barney since after being attacked by an assassin at the chess tournament a few days ago.\n\"There's, something, I wanted to talk about, with Barney…\"\nWhen Monica spoke in a choppy manner, Lana looked into Monica's face with concern.\nNot wanting to make Lana worried, Monica lifted the edge of her lips awkwardly.\n\"I will be fine.\"\n\"…If he did something to you, scream as loud as you can and say ‘this dorky glasses just shoved his face up into my skirt!.' That way, you can socially crush him without using violence.\"\nBarney's cheeks twitched when he heard Lana uttering such a disturbing thing in a serious manner. But Monica only gave Lana a wry smile, trying to placate her.\n\"Don't worry… I'm fine now.\"\nShe was still nervous, but even so, right now Monica didn't feel terrified at the idea of facing Barney. It was probably because Lana had shared with her some courage to face Barney.\n\"Lana, you should go meet your father.\"\n\"… well, if you say so.\"\nLana nodded reluctantly, stuck her tongue out at Barney, and left.\nLooking off at the back of her heroic figure, Barney creased the bridge of his nose and muttered.\n\"…You sure got yourself a pretty dependable friend, don't you?\"\nIn response to the sarcastic Barney, Monica nodded with a bit of a shy smile.\n\"Yeah, she's my proud friend.\"\nAfter having his sarcasm passed off that way, Barney let out a bland sigh and shrugged his shoulders.\n\"Let's change the place first. I don't want to stand around talking in this place.\"\n\"Y-Yeah. I'll take you to a less crowded place.\"\nMonica started to walk away, and Barney followed silently behind her. Without any conversation between them.\nBack in their school days, they used to walk side by side in the corridors of Minerva, talking about trivial things and subjects… but now, the distance between them, the way they don't look at each other, is their current relationship.\nSuch a relationship did make her feel a little sad, but it didn't hurt her heart anymore.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nMonica led Barney to the backyard where she had previously used to eat lunch alone.\n\"People rarely come to this place…\"\n\"I suppose this place does look like something you'd like. I bet you've been eating alone here anyway, haven't you?\"\n\"N-Not for a while…\"\nBut it's different now. She has been eating in the cafeteria together with Lana, Claudia, and sometimes with Neil and Glenn.\nMonica fidgeted around, kneading her fingers, as she glanced at Barney before starting to breach the conversation.\n\"Did you come here following your teacher as his associate, Barney?\"\nMaybe like what Roberto did, she thought he was accompanying his teacher, but Barney shook his head.\n\"No, after what just happened, there is no teacher from Minerva who wanted to come to this year's festival.\"\nAn incident a few days ago claimed the life of one of Minerva's teachers. And the death of Eugene Pittman has created an uproar in Minerva now.\nSurely, under such circumstances, it was only natural that Minerva's teachers would not want to participate. Although it was wrong to feel this way, Monica was a little relieved. Because the biggest concern for Monica was bumping into Minerva's teacher she was familiar with.\n\"…wait. Then how did you manage to be able to attend here…?\"\n\"Who do you think I am? I'm a member of the House of Count Ambard. So long I asked the invitation to the school, they should have no reason to refuse my request.\"\n\"R-Right…\"\nMonica may not know much about it, but Barney's family, the House of Count Ambard, is one of the most prominent families in the Ridill Kingdom. Barney was very proud of this fact and used to say \"Our Count Ambard Household is…\" or the like.\nAs she reminisced about this, Barney interrupted her with a somewhat indifferent tone.\n\"You said you wanted to talk to me about something, didn't you? Since it's you, you're probably going to say, ‘Why didn't you reveal my true identity at that time?'\"\n\"…Mm.\"\nAfter Monica fought off an assassin who was impersonating Eugene Pittman, Barney had hidden Lynn away, gave false information, and told them that he was the one who fought off the assassin so to hide Monica's true identity. Because of his lies, Monica's true identity was not revealed and she's still able to stay at the school.\n—Even so, Barney should have no reason to cover Monica.\nBut Barney answered her question fluently as if he's been prepared this line for a long time.\n\"I've been thinking your reason for enrolling in Serendia Academy. At first, I thought you were just doing it for fun, assuming now you are the Seven Sages. But, after remembering about the enrollment of the Second Prince in this academy, and the incident of an intruder at the chess tournament, it's more plausible to conclude that you've been dispatched to this school to guard the Second Prince.\"\nMonica bit her lip and nodded when Barney stared at her for confirmation.\nNormally, she should keep this mission a secret, but it was useless trying to fool Barney now.\n\"You came to this academy to guard the Second Prince as your duty as the Seven Sage, so it's only natural for a noble of the Ridill Kingdom like myself to help you at that time. And for that reason, I did cover your identity,\nLady Everett\n.\"\nBarney especially emphasized his reason for helping her was not because Monica's his friend, but because it's his duty as a noble to help the Seven Sages. He then stared at the now silent Monica before smiling sarcastically.\n\"Did it convince you,\nLady Everett\n?\"\nSure enough, Barney never thought of Monica as his friend. He persistently pushed that fact on Monica over and over again. It was as if he's trying to make her think that way. Probably her words as his friend will not reach Barney anymore. Even then, there was still one thing that she really wanted to ask him.\n\"…I still have one question, but you don't have to answer if you don't want to.\"\n\"Oh, what would it be? As a member of the House of Count Ambard, I will do my best to answer any question the Seven Sage ask.\"\nMonica only closed her eyes once in response to Barney's sarcastic remark, but then she opened her eyes, looking straight at him.\n\"…Barney, why did you participate in the chess tournament?\"\nBarney's expression fell when hearing such a sudden question. Monica's been wondering this question ever since she reunited with Barney. Looking back at what happened in Minerva when she's still a student, Barney always ridiculed it as a ‘game for people with so much spare time.' And insisted that people who were enrolling in the Magician Training Institute Minerva should use their time to master spell instead. So when she met Barney and saw him participated in a chess tournament, it really surprised her, albeit in a different way.\nAs if he had been hit with a sore spot, Barney made a bitter face at Monica's question.\nLooking at his reaction, Monica wondered if she had said something horrible, or if she had hurt him again.\n\"Um, if you don't want to answer. I'm sorry if I asked you something weird…\"\n\"You see… I'll be dropping out from Minerva soon..\"\n\"…eh?\"\nThe unexpected words made Monica stunned, her lips were half-open.\nSurprisingly, Barney responded to her with a weary smile… a smile that looked like he had given up on something.\n\"You see, my brother died in an accident last month. And it's not caused by a conspiracy or assassination or anything like that. He just went for a long ride to show off, but because he's not good at equestrianism, he fell off from his horse and broke his neck… a stupid way to die, as befits him.\"\nMonica didn't know any circumstances inside Barney's household. But she had heard that he's the second son of Count Ambard and his brother will inherit the household. That's why Barney, who can't inherit the house, has been studying hard in Minerva to become the Seven Sages and obtain the Count Magician rank which was equal to the Count rank.\nNow that his brother was dead… as the next line of the successor, he will take over his brother's position to inherit the house.\n\"…Barney, did you really had given up to become the Seven Sages?\"\n\"Yeah, in the upcoming winter, I will return to my hometown to concentrate on my studies to become the next Count. And for that reason as well, I took partake to play in a chess tournament a bit.\"\nJust because he's born as the second son, his achievement was not recognized, which welling up his anger and his craving for acknowledgment. He's been suppressing his dissatisfaction and squeezed his body very hard to pile up so many achievements so as to get recognized by others. But what will he think when all those efforts were crumbled in an instant. And becoming the head which he had wanted so much ever since his childhood was coming in an unexpected way, surely he would not be happy about it, or so she thought.\n\"To be honest with you, I was relieved. I really was.\"\n\"…eh?\"\n\"This way, I could give up my goal to become the Seven Sages.\"\nMonica silenced, and Barney, in his deeply weary face, muttered to himself.\n\"Actually… maybe for a long time, somewhere in my heart, I've given up on becoming one of the Seven Sages.\"\nBarney's words were hard for Monica to believe. Because she had seen Barney's efforts more closely than anyone else. At how hardworking he was and how talented he was. Even many had believed that he would become a first-rate magician in the future.\n\"…was it because of me?\"\nMonica asked in a hushed voice, and Barney gave her a sneer. Either he's mocking Monica for her stupidity, or he himself…or maybe both.\n\"That's right. It's all your fault. It's all happened because you mastered the no-chant spell and showed everyone how talented you are… She might have done it to tell how much different our talent was. A talent that I couldn't possibly reach nor I could possibly dream on, or so I thought.\"\nBarney let out a dry laugh and turned his eyes behind his glasses to look at Monica.\n\"Even so, you still smiled so innocently at me, hoping to get my praise. I couldn't help but think, ‘are you mocking me!?'\"\nNo matter how much malice and hatred he laid out, Barney's tone was no longer has any vigor behind it. After all, he had already given up. He had given up on the future he had envisioned for himself as the Seven Sages.\n\"You kept saying that I was your friend, but I never intended to make you my friend…\"\nMonica had already given up on having Barney's expectation.\nBut it still pained her when the memories of him reached out his helping hand to her or when they've been studying together were denied outright. Even then, Barney spoke to the hanging down Monica.\n\"…what I want is to have a rival with an equal standing.\"\nMonica blinked and slowly lifted her hanging head to look up at Barney.\nWhen Barney saw Monica's dumbfounded face, he snorted and laughed in a sarcastic way, just like he always does.\n\"As a capable person as I am, sooner or later, I'll make a name for myself as the greatest Count Ambard of all time. Right, I suppose our rank is equal now, isn't it, Count Magician Everett.\"\n\"…eh? Uh, um… yes?\"\nWhen Monica nodded vaguely at his change in attitude, Barney folded his arms and smiled haughtily.\n\"One day, I'll become a competent count that you'll want to rely on. And when I do, please don't be ashamed to rely on me.\"\nBarney said this throwaway line as if he had nothing more to say before turning his back on Monica.\nMonica and Barney will probably never be friends again.\nBut not all their relationship has been cut. Even after a broken friendship, there are always new relationships that can sprout.\nMonica bowed her head to Barney's back as he walked away.\n\"…I deeply thank you for your cooperation in this mission. Lord Barney Jones of the Count of Ambard.\"\nBarney stopped, turned his head back at Monica, and smiled. A nostalgic smile as if to say, \"you're so hopeless without me,\" as he once did to Monica, who cried, \"Barney, help me.\"\n\"That's right. You should be thanking me for the rest of your life.\"",

      "content": "After parting ways with Barney, Monica headed for the school gate area. When arrived, she soon found Lana standing there, accompanied by a well-dressed middle-aged man. He must be Baron Colette, Lana's father.\n\"Monica! Over here!\"\nMonica trotted over to Lana, who began to introduce her to her father cheerfully.\n\"Monica, this is my father. And father, this is the girl I always mention in my letters, Monica.\"\n\"Oh, so you're Monica. Nice to meet you. I'm Baron Collete, Lana's father.\"\nBaron Colette smiled amiably at Monica while playing with his mustache.\nHe was a well-built, middle-aged man, and much like Lana, he's also got flaxen hair. He dressed in luxurious but strangely not looked crude. Perhaps he has a knack for matching outfits. Just like his daughter, he's got a sense of style.\nMonica was nervous, but she tried her best not to sound rude.\n\"Um, I've been in Lana's care until now…\"\n\"Please don't be. It's also my pleasure to have you as my daughter's friend… hmm.\"\nBaron Colette stroked his chin and looked at Monica with narrowed eyes. The expression on his face was very similar to Lana's when she examined Monica's clothes and hairstyle.\n\"I see…she's just like the person I imagine when I read the letter…indeed, I can picture the bright green colored dress that you wore at twelve would perfectly fit for her. Oh, right, I have already delivered the tailored dress to your room, Lana. You can check it out later.\"\nApparently, Lana had asked her father to tailor a dress for Monica to wear to the ball tonight.\nBaron Colette looked at his daughter and gave her a rather proud look.\n\"The ruffles around the shoulders of that dress were too childish for a girl of her age, weren't they? So I had the seamstress remove the sleeves to give the upper body a sleek design. But in exchange, I added a large ribbon at the waist and made the ruffles and drapes flow diagonally from there to give it more substance.\"\n\"Right, right! Dresses with elaborate drapes are more popular these days…\"\n\"I know right? I think I've done a good job for myself. You can expect a lot from it.\"\n\"I expect no less from my dad!\"\n\"By the way, I've made a ribbon out of leftover fabric. I think that would be lovely to braid it into her hair.\"\n\"That's a wonderful idea! I'll definitely do that!\"\nMonica could hardly understand the conversation between Lana and Baron Colette, but it seemed that Baron Colette had made various changes to Lana's second-hand dress.\nNevertheless, the excited look on their face when talking about this kind of topic showed that they really are father and daughter.\nThe way Baron Colette looked at her daughter was very gentle. Just by being near him, she can feel the deep affection that Baron Colette has for his only daughter.\n…father.\nMonica's father, who was unfashionable and socially awkward, might be different from Lana's father. But, the gentle look they gave at their daughter was similar.\nMonica felt nostalgic yet melancholy as she watched the father-daughter exchange quietly.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nIt was decided Monica would watch the outdoor play with Baron Collete and his daughter together. As the play was the main attraction of the festival, most of the chairs were occupied, though there was still some time before the curtain went up. Some of them even were watching from the balconies and windows of the school building.\nAs Monica sat down in an empty seat, she heard Lynn's voice, who was keeping an eye in disguise as a little bird.\n\"The Second Prince has taken his seat. He is seated diagonally in front of you.\"\nMonica checked Felix's position, moving only her eyes enough to not be incongruous, and saw Felix had seated in a special seat up ahead along with a group of nobles who seemed to be guests of honor.\nBut Lynn's words didn't stop.\n\"Also, about Lord Louis who'll be mingling with the common people as planned…\"\nWhat about Louis?\n\"He's sat right behind you, Miss [Silent Witch].\"\n\"Eh!?\"\nSomeone kicked her chair from behind when she let out a strange yelp. Monica gulped and turned around in horror to find that, just as Lynn had said, Louis Miller, the [Barrier Magician], was sitting cross-legged right behind her. His wife, Mrs. Rosalie, was also sitting next to him.\nLouis gave her a beautiful smile when Monica met his eyes.\n\"Pardon me. I seem to have bumped my foot on your chair.\"\n\"N-No, it's okay…\"\nWhen Monica turned awkwardly forward, Lana poked Monica's arm and whispered in her ear.\n\"Hey! Wasn't the person sitting right behind you Louis Miller the Seven Sage?\"\n\"…uh, well…\"\n\"He's known for his title as the dragon slayer, you see! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I never thought I'd see him in person…\"\nLana's voice bounced with excitement.\nLouis had been a remarkable magician in the kingdom even before he became one of the Seven Sage because of his outstanding achievements in defeating dragons.\nIn addition to his ability, his beautiful appearance is said to have attracted the attention of various women.\nIf you ask people to name all of the Seven Sage, the first or second name that would come up would be Louis Miller. Incidentally, Monica Everett, the [Silent Witch] had the least presence among the Seven Sages to even get questioned, ‘who's the Seventh Sage, again?'\nAnd Lana, who kept saying ‘oh my God' excitedly, had no idea that the person who was sitting beside her was Louis' colleague and also one of the Seven Sages.\nUgh, why was Louis sitting right behind me…\nAs Monica held her hurting stomach, she heard Lynn's voice.\n\"Incidentally, Lord Louis had arrived first.\"\nUgh…!\nIn other words, the kick on her chair earlier was a message from Louis, \"Why are you sitting in front of me of all people, you stupid girl?\"\nI'm sorry, I'm sorry. It was a coincidence. I didn't notice iiiiiiit…\nMonica stroked her hurting stomach and waited for the play to start.\nEventually, the curtain rose on the stage.\nThe play was telling a story about how Ralph, the first king of the Ridill Kingdom established his kingdom. A story where every person in this country has heard at least once.\nWhen this land was not yet a \"kingdom\" and seven tribes were fighting each other. Ralph, a young man of the Earth Tribe, was ordered by Arklade, the Spirit King of the Earth, to unite the seven tribes, which he accomplished after a long adventure. At the end of the story, he defeated the Dark Dragon in the land where dragons live and established the Ridill Kingdom there.\nThe story itself was fairly long, so the play was divided into two parts: the adventures leading up to the unification of the seven tribes, and the final battle against the dragon.\nThe main character, Ralph, was played by a tall, blond male student. Actually, the role was supposed to be played by Felix, but he turned it down because he was too busy working as the student council president.\n\"Oh, Lord Ralph, please take me with you. For even though it would be against the laws of my Water Tribe, I still believed in the ray of light I see in you.\"\nThe one speaking to the protagonist Ralph was the heroine Amelia, who would later become Ralph's future wife. Her role was played by a somewhat fragile and dainty young lady. She had skin that was white as fine porcelain, wheat hair that a soft and fluffy, and large eyes that were a pale blue-gray. She was Eliane Hyatt, one of the three most beautiful women in the academy, alongside Bridget and Claudia, or so Lana told Monica in a whisper.\nHer petite and lavish figure gave a somewhat fleeting impression, which was different from that of the graceful Bridget and the mysterious Claudia.\nEventually, the play progressed and the main protagonist, Ralph, united the seven tribes and gained the blessings of the Seven Spirit Kings.\nHowever, the more the play went on, the more dull the audience's response became, and all of it became apparent as time goes. Not a few of the audience got lost in chatting and laughing, while others had left their seats.\nAlthough it was a long play, the script of the play itself was not bad at all. They managed to summarize the long original story very well, and the scenes were easy to understand.\nThe stage setup was elaborate and the fireworks were gorgeous. Even the old-style costumes were beautifully arranged in a modern style.\n—However, the characters themselves were lack of impression.\nThe male student who played the main protagonist, Ralph, was reasonably good at acting, but the way he spoke his dialogue was bland. He spoke poorly, and his voice lacked intensity. As a result, he did not reach the public's image of a heroic king.\nThe same can be said for Eliane, who played Amelia.\nAmelia was a strong, noble, and beautiful woman. However, Eliane, who played her role, was fragile and delicate, a well-raised young woman you wanted to protect.\nIt's not that Eliane was bad at acting, but she was far from the image of the strong and noble Amelia. In other words, it was a complete miscasting.\nSoon, the first half of the play came to a close and the audience applauded. It was not sparse applause, but it also was not because the audience was moved by the performance.\nThe applause came because the son and daughter of a famous noble family performed out a story that everyone knew by heart.\n—I knew it, His Highness should be the one to play Ralph.\n—The role of Queen Amelia should have been played by Lady Bridget.\n—I think Lady Eliane would have been better suited to play the priestess role.\n—Oh, I wish I could have seen Ralph played by His Highness!\nSuch voices can be heard all over the place.\nAs I thought, His Highness and Lady Bridget are a perfect match…\nFelix and Bridget, with their gorgeous good looks, even just sitting side by side were a picture in itself.\nAbove all, Felix's imposing bearing and Bridget's dignified atmosphere both fit the image of Ralph and Amelia perfectly. If those two had been on stage, the quality of the applause would have been different in scale.\n\"Monica, there's a little time before the second half of the play, shall we go get something light to eat?\"\n\"Uh, okay.\"\nMonica stood up at Lana's urging and turned her head to look for Felix, but he was completely blended in with the crowd and was nowhere to be seen.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"Young Lady Eliane, it was a wonderful performance.\"\nThe servants approached Eliane as she went backstage.\nEliane gave a short \"yeah\" with a somewhat absent-minded expression and pushed the veil she was wearing to the servant.\nFrom the top of the stage, she could see the audience clearly. The person she's most fixated on —Felix Ark Riddile—was naturally in her sight.\nEliane was constantly following Felix with her eyes during the performance. Even when she acted on the scene where she confesses her feelings to Ralph, she turned her head towards him, ignoring the instructions of the director.\nFelix certainly looked at Eliane from the audience… but his eyes only saw Eliane as an actor on stage. It was the same look he gave to Ralph and the rest of the cast. He didn't put all his attention just to look at Eliane.\nThis is strange. After all, he shall be the one who will eventually become my husband.\nEliane sighed sadly with a somewhat dreamy expression on her face.\nI can't allow it to end like this. Lord Felix should only look at me… he should only love me more and more.\nEliane wanted to perform the play together with Felix, so she repeatedly asked the director to make him the main protagonist, unfortunately, her wish could not be granted. Her wish responded with a curt reason that he was busy with the student council duties.\nGreat uncle said I should be loved more. So, Lord Felix should love me even more. He should be.\nEliane dismissed the servants and went to the edge of the stage alone. At the edge of the stage was a set that resembled a balcony. There was a ladder at the end of the stage, not visible from the audience, which could be climbed to reach the balcony.\nEliane put her hand on the ladder and chanted a short spell. It's not some kind of complicated spell. Just a little bit of wind spell to make a few cracks in the wooden planks.\nEventually, Eliane took her hand off the ladder, pulled out the hair ornament from her wheat-colored hair, and threw it onto the balcony above the stage.\nThen, when the male student playing Ralph passes by, she let out a scream.\n\"Kyaa!\"\nThe male student who acted as Ralph, noticing Eliane's scream, immediately rushed over and asked, \"What's wrong?\"\nEliane pointed over the balcony, her eyes moist with tears.\n\"A bird… took my hair ornament… and put it on the balcony.\"\n\"Oh, well, I'm sure that bird was just playing a trick on you to get your attention, Miss Eliane.\"\nThe boy smiled cheerfully and started to climb the ladder leading to the balcony. He was probably trying to show Eliane his good side.\nHowever, just as he was about to reach the balcony, a crack appeared in the ladder on which the boy had placed his feet.\n\"Aaaaah!\"\nThe boy reached out his hand in the air as if to ask for help. But no one grabbed his hand, and his body slammed headlong into the floor.\nEliane put her hands on both cheeks and let out a shrill scream.\n\"Kyaaaa! Somebody, please come here!\"",

      "content": "After the first half of the play was over, Baron Colette prompted Lana and Monica to have their lunch without him. Apparently, he had some business to discuss with the attending nobles at the school festival. After all, the seasonal events of the high society in the summer drawing to a close and the number of balls dwindling, so the Serendia School Festival has become an important social event for those who have been invited.\nAs for Lana and Monica, they decided to return to the school building to get some light meals.\nDuring the school festival, the cafeteria was open to the public, which it's packed with people for the most time. So to provide a space for light meals and tea parties, the school has opened up some of the classrooms.\n\"I heard Glenn was helping out in the light meal area…\"\n\"From what he told me, his family owns a butcher store. Will he serve grilled skewers too, I wonder. Shall we go visit his class?\"\n\"Mm.\"\nSince the first half of the play just finished, the school building has been crowded with the audience from the play. Monica, who used to be in a mountain cabin, would have probably gotten nauseous and exhausted in no time.\n… maybe I've grown up a little…\nHaving Lana next to her was probably one of the reasons why she didn't feel overwhelmed by the crowd. Lana was able to weave her way through the crowds with ease. By following Lana, Monica was able to get through the crowd without much trouble.\n\"You walk in crowded places… very well, Lana.\"\n\"Is that so? But the local bazaar is even more overwhelming, you know. It's so tightly packed that if I'm not careful, I won't be able to take a single step…oh?\"\nLana stopped and looked ahead, and Monica followed suit.\nAhead of Lana's gaze, Felix was surrounded by several students. The students surrounding Felix looked familiar to Monica. They were the people responsible for directing the play, staging, etc.\nLana, who was in charge of costumes for the play, tilted her head and asked, \"What's going on?\" Then, a girl with glasses who was trying to persuade Felix noticed Lana and waved widely.\n\"Miss Lana Collette! You just came in time! As a person in charge of the costumes of the play, please help me convince His Highness!\"\n\"…What's happened, Senior Mabel?\"\nWhen Lana asked skeptically, the bespectacled schoolgirl known as Mabel turned red and spoke rapidly.\n\"The student who plays Ralph fell off the stage set and got hurt. He broke his arm and can't continue to play the role. We need someone to replace him!\"\nBoth Monica and Lana rounded their eyes at Mabel's words.\nRalph was the main character of the play. Finding a replacement for him would prove to be difficult.\n…so the reason they're coming to see His Highness…\nMonica glanced at Felix as she began to grasp what was going on, and saw him shrugging his shoulders in a troubled manner.\n\"Right, they're begging me to replace him. Now I'm in a bit of a bind.\"\nApparently, Felix was not that interested in performing on the stage. However, Mabel was trying her best to persuade Felix in exaggerated gestures.\n\"Your Highness! Looking at these circumstances, the only choice I have is to cancel the play or ask Your Highness to perform on stage! The Gods of Art will always give me a test, but only if I can overcome this ordeal will I receive the applause I deserve!\"\nMabel, who often went on trips to her own world when it came to art, looked a lot like a certain musician.\nFelix probably didn't want to cancel the play either. After all, it was the main attraction of the festival.\nFelix held his chin in his hand and pondered for a moment.\n\"Is there anyone else who can fill in the role?\"\n\"Not just anyone can play the main protagonist, Ralph! First of all, he must be a tall man to match the costume! Secondly, the second half of the play is mainly dragon-slaying scenes, despite the lack of dialogue. In other words, he has to be physically strong! Third, his voice! This is the most important. In the outdoor stage, the voice does not reverberate as much as in the indoor stage. In other words, he must have a voice that resonates well!\"\nWell, given those conditions, it certainly seemed that there was no one more qualified than Felix.\nFelix had slender long legs, tall, handsome, and physically gifted to the point that he was praised by his teachers in sword art and horseback riding classes. Also, as he was used to speaking in public, he knew how to speak in a way that could be heard by many people. Even though he was not shouting, his voice echoed clearly. Above all, if the country's second prince were to play the role of the first king, that would be enough to boost the excitement of the audience.\nMonica sneaked an earful to Lana.\n\"Oh, um, is it possible to adjust the costume to match the actor?\"\n\"It's difficult. It was originally designed to look good on tall men, so forcing someone to fill the hem would make it look unnatural.\"\nIn that case, the options were getting very limited.\nMabel and the others were desperate not to let Felix slip away at any cost. Their eyes were like those of a snake aiming for its prey.\nAs Monica was perplexed by the tense atmosphere, the door of a nearby classroom rattled open and a voice that ridiculously loud came out.\n\"Aaah! You came, too, Monica, Lana! The spice roast is just about ready! And I recommend the veal stew! The school chef cooked our meat really well, and it taste so tender and juicy, you have to try it!\"\nGlenn who had the sleeves of his uniform rolled up, wearing a bandana on his head and an apron tied to his uniform looked very much out of place as a student at this school.\nWhile the students involved in the stage were stunned by the sudden intrusion, Glenn noticed Felix's presence and greeted him with a cheerful smile.\n\"Oh, President! Thank you for ordering my family's meat today! My father and mother are both very proud of me! It's like I've done a lifetime's worth of filial piety!\"\nFelix smiled graciously at Glenn, who had a big smile on his face.\nBut Monica saw that his eyes narrowed for a moment as he examined Glenn's entire body. He's definitely up to something.\n\"I'm glad to hear you feel that way, Dudley.\"\n\"No, I'm really thankful for that, President!\"\n\"Really? Then would you do me a favor?\"\n\"Anything you say.\"\nWhen Glenn nodded in reply, Monica inwardly held her head.\nOh, you shouldn't, Glenn. You can't just nod at the President's request…\nOf course, Monica's inner voice did not reach Glenn.\nFelix gave a beautiful smile and turned to Mabel and the others.\n\"I believe the person you need for his replacement was tall, physically strong, and with a strong voice… right?\"\n\"Well, yes…\"\n\"I guess he fits the description perfectly, then.\"\nSo said Felix as he patted Glenn on the shoulder.\nWell, it's true that Glenn was taller and more physically capable than most boys his age. Not to mention the loudness of his voice.\nGlenn, not understanding this situation, looked at Felix with a blank face.\n\"Well, a replacement? For the president? Oh, you mean acting as student council president for a day? I have no confidence in my ability to say something wise like President, though.\"\n\"No, it's much easier than that. You are going to slay the dragon and protect the beautiful heroine.\"\nFelix's words made Glenn's eyes sparkle. It was as if he was a dog being offered a piece of meat with a bone.\nMonica swore she could feel the image of his tail wagging around on his back.\n\"Slaying the dragons… protecting the heroine… that's awesome! It's so cool!\"\n\"So cool?\"\nWhen Felix recited Glenn's words with a tilt of his head, Glenn clenched his fists and reiterated his remarks.\n\"I mean, that's super cool!\"\n\"Ah, yes, it's cool. After all, you're going to be acting as a hero of this country. So you'd better tone down your accent.\"\n\"Got it! I mean… Yes, sir!\"\nThe fact that he seemed to believe he had hidden his accent with this was already quite worrying.\nBut Felix saw nothing wrong with that and pushed Glenn toward Mabel and the others.\n\"As you can see, he's very eager to do it.\"\n\"I don't know about you, but I'm gonna do my best… I mean, I'll do my best!\"\nMabel and the others' faces were colored with anxiety and confusion. They weren't the only ones. It was the same for Lana and Monica. And yet, with a face full of enthusiasm, Glenn said, \"So, what kind of dragon are we fighting?\" and so on.\nAnd so, with all of the tumultuous events of the second half of the stage about to take place, the curtain was about to rise.",

      "content": "\"As you can see, this Glenn Dudley will be acting as the hero.\"\nMabel introduced a friendly-looking young man with golden-brown hair to the cast members gathered backstage.\nMy, my, my?\nEliane, who played the heroine role, showed an ostensible calmness and tilted her head, but the gleam in bluish-grey eyes was darkened.\nWhy is it not Lord Felix? Why is\nthat person\nnot the substitute when I was the heroine? …ah, that's right, this Glenn Dudley guy probably begged them to make him play the hero role. He must be.\nAs Eliane was calming herself down by telling herself that, Mabel, the director who had brought Glenn, said as she lifted the rim of her glasses with a grim face.\n\"For your information, this Glenn Dudley boy… was recommended directly by His Highness Felix.\"\nHah? Eliane tried her best to hold back the unladylike voice that almost come out of her mouth.\nFelix recommended him? Another man, to act as Eliane's partner?\nHow can such a thing be allowed? Of course, it can't. Felix was supposed to be Eliane's partner. It would be unacceptable to assign another man to Eliane.\nMoreover, with a man who looked like he didn't have a shred of decency!\n\"I'm Glenn Dudley! I've never done any acting before, but I did a lot of playing Ralph the hero when I was a kid, so I think I can manage it!\"\nEveryone in the room wondered about how he could be so confident when he only did was playing the hero in his childhood. Even Eliane did think so.\nThe other cast members looked at Glenn with eyes full of uncertainty. Eliane would have liked to do the same, but since she had to maintain her upbringing, she spoke to Glenn with a smile that was typical of a dainty young lady.\n\"I am Eliane Hyatt, I play the role of Amelia. I hope we could work together to bring the best play.\"\n\"…you play the Amelia role?\"\nGlenn blinked his eyes and turned his gaze down to look at Eliane. Seeing him up close like this had shown them how tall his figure was. The smaller Eliane had to tilt her head back to look up at him.\n\"You seem so different from the cool Amelia I'd imagined.\"\nThe rest of the cast members froze at Glenn's words. Eliane, too, kept her soft smile but the fire of anger quietly lit in her bluish-grey eyes.\nThe heroine, Amelia, was described as a strong, noble, and wise woman. It was understandable why the role of Amelia was not suitable for the somewhat dainty Eliane.\nEven with this problem, Eliane was chosen because she was one of the three most beautiful women in the school—while the more important reason was that she's the cousin of Felix Ark Ridill.\nTo Eliane, Duke Crockford was her great uncle. As the school under the control of Duke Crockford, Eliane held the same high position as Felix. Therefore, the people around her took this into consideration when they selected Eliane to be the heroine.\nEven Eliane was already aware of the fact she didn't make it to the top three at the school secret voting for the role of heroine Amelia which was held before the play.\n…to put it simply, Glenn Dudley's innocent remark had incensed Eliane's anger completely.\nOf course, Eliane wouldn't allow her anger to show on her face, instead, she acted modestly like a gentle lady.\n\"Admittedly, I am not nearly as good as the great Queen Amelia. Nevertheless, I will do my very best, so I hope we could work together in the play.\"\nKeeping up appearances, Eliane showed him a beautiful smile on her pretty face.\nOh, what a foolish guy… I will prove how mistaken you are to try forcing your way standing on this stage with me…\nWhile sharpening the blade of malice in her mind.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"While we're at it, why not take a special seat and watch Dudley's valiant performance?\"\nSo said Felix and brought Monica to the special seat where he had been sitting in the first half of the play.\n\"W-Won't I will be scolded if I sit in this seat?\"\n\"You're also a member of our student council. So, there's nothing wrong with that.\"\nFor the record, Lana had gone backstage to fine-tune the costumes. She said the work would probably take until the last minute, so it would be difficult for her to come back to the audience seat.\nThis meant that Monica would be sitting next to Felix, watching Glenn perform on stage. Doubly as bad for her heart.\nAs Monica was holding her stomach, Felix turned his attention to the white rose ornament on Monica's chest.\n\"That flower ornament… did Cyril give it to you, by any chance?\"\n\"O-Oh, yes. He said it was a charm that would save me from embarrassment for the rest of the day.\"\nWhen Monica nodded her head as she answered, Felix, blinked in surprise.\n\"Is that so? So Cyril said that. Well, it is very like him… I guess.\"\nFelix mused to himself and stared at Monica's neck for some reason.\nWhen she saw that his eyes were scrutinized a little bit—well, really a little bit, as if he was unhappy, Monica unconsciously put her hand on her neck.\n\"U-Uh… U-Um… Oh, yes, will Glenn… be okay?\"\nThe way she tried to change the topic might be sounded a bit forced, nevertheless, she did indeed feel curious about Glenn.\nMonica's mind wandered to the ballroom dance class where she first met Glenn.\nThe memory of Glenn saying \"I've never done it before, but I will manage it somehow!\" as he cheerfully dancing in a circle together felt so nostalgic in her mind. She honestly can't imagine this play… will be ended well.\nBut Felix didn't seem to be particularly worried. In fact, he seemed to be somewhat enjoying it.\n\"Hmm, I think he'll be okay. You can see he's got some guts. I guess that's a disciple of a renowned magician for you.\"\n\"…huh?\"\nMonica knew that Glenn was an apprentice magician, but she had never heard of him being the apprentice of a renowned magician.\nCome to think of it… I heard that Glenn came to this school at the behest of his master…\nBut who exactly was a magician that Felix refers to as \"renowned\"?\nMonica tried to vaguely picture the high-ranking magicians she knew in her mind, but she couldn't quite put her finger on it.\nWhy did Glenn's master choose Serendia Academy in the first place, when a disciple of a renowned magician would normally enter Minerva…?\nAs she was absentmindedly thinking about this, fireworks went off to signal the start of the play.\nA student acting as a narrator explained the story so far and that the main protagonist, Ralph, had finally arrived at the Dark Dragon's place.\n\"Sounds like they've omitted some of the content.\"\nFelix, who had heard the narration, muttered in a whisper.\n\"I-Is that so?\"\n\"Originally, they were supposed to perform the journey all the way up to the Dark Dragon, but they probably cut it down for the play.\"\nWhen the curtain rose, a dragon appeared from the left side of the stage. It was made of paper and cloth pasted on a wooden frame, but the result was really well made. Above all, it was large. Inside, several people were moving it.\nTwo figures appeared from the right side of the stage as the roaring cry of the Dark Dragon echoed throughout the hall.\nThe two were the main characters of the play: Ralph, the hero, and Amelia, the heroine.\n\"‘The Seven Spirit Kings have given their blessings to me! O, Dark Dragon that brings destructions upon this land, take this blade of mine!'\"\nThe audience, who had been confused by the different actors from the first half, were swept up into the performance the moment they heard the lines.\nRather than good acting, Glenn's resonant voice and sharp movements had the capacity to draw the viewer in.\nGlenn leaped up high and swung his sword down at the dragon. Then, as soon as he landed, he made a horizontal slash in a flash.\nFelix said in a whisper.\n\"His sword may be too big to use in battle, but it looks great on stage.\"\nThe sword Glenn wielded was a crude sword, the exact opposite of the gracefulness unique to nobles. However, the way his long arms and legs stretched out to slash at the dragon was eye-catching.\nAfter the hero Ralph drove the Dark Dragon into a corner with the help of the Spirit King, Dark Dragon mustered all his strength to cast one last spell of fire. To block it, the heroine, Amelia, would create a defensive barrier, and Ralph will pierce the Dark Dragon between its eyes to finish it off.\nAfter that, Amelia would run up to Ralph and give him a kiss of blessing, and that was the classic ending…\n\"‘Oh, you wretched human! I shall reduce you to dust with my flames!'\"\nAs the dark dragon shook its wings, a burst of sound was heard right in the middle of the Dark Dragon and Ralph. The explosion was made with gunpowder.\nAs Ralph took a step back, Amelia, who was standing behind him, raised her voice.\n\"‘Lord Ralph, please pierce the dragon's forehead while I set up a defensive barrier!'\"\nShouting this, Amelia chanted a spell to set up a barrier. Of course, it was supposed to be an act, so it's not a proper chant.\nHowever, Monica felt something strange.\n…wait, that spell should just be an act… right?\nNot many people can instantly understand the contents of a spell just by listening to its chant. And since the stage and the audience were far apart, normally no one would have noticed.\nBut Monica, who happened to be watching from a special seat, heard and understood the spell that she was chanting.\nWhat Eliane was uttering was neither meaningless dialogue nor a chant of a defensive barrier.\nIt's a wind magic spell used to attack the enemy.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nEliane was now standing on a cliff-like set on the far right side of the auditorium.\nDuring the first half of the play, what had been a balcony was now made of paper and cloth to look like a sheer cliff, and Eliane was standing on top of it.\nEliane was standing on it, looking worriedly at Ralph as he fought off the dragon, but also paying attention to Felix in the audience.\nShe has found out the person next to Felix was not a guest of honor, but a certain female student. Moreover, she's not Bridgette Graham, but just another student council member, a plain girl named Monica Norton.\nWhy is that dull girl sitting next to Lord Felix? That place belongs to me.\nEvery time Felix spoke to Monica about something in a whisper, Eliane's mind was violently distracted.\nWhy would Felix care about a girl like that? Eliane was looking at Felix with such sadness. Even though she loves him. Even though she is the one who should be loved by him.\nI will let her know her place. I will make Felix choose me.\nThe battle between the Dark Dragon and Ralph was now drawing to a climax.\nIn order to protect Ralph from the attack of the Dark Dragon, Amelia, played by Eliane, will cast a defensive barrier…that's what will unfold later. Of course, Eliane can't use any barrier spells technique, so she just had to act accordingly.\nTo produce this scene, they will use the most gorgeous fireworks. A firework made using a special kind of gunpowder that produced colored smoke along with the light, and it will be launched at the back of the stage. This will take place in the background as Ralph and the Dark Dragon are just facing each other in the front of the stage.\nBut when Eliane performing the act of setting up a defensive barrier, she released her wind spell at the gunpowder. The spell she could use was only a basic one. A spell to create a mass wind and to cut with the wind. Although its power is not high, such wind spells are convenient because its invisibility. No one watching this play has noticed that Eliane was using real magic on stage.\nThe gunpowder device, which had been hit by the mass of wind, tumbled to the side of Glenn just before it exploded. This would cause Glenn to be caught in the explosion of that gunpowder.\nIt's your fault for making me look like a fool.\nAnd so, the exploding gunpowder caused sparks and smoke to spread towards Glenn. Since it was merely for dramatic purposes, it was unlikely that he would be seriously injured. However, he would probably fall on his buttocks in surprise. Or maybe he'd be scared out of his wits!\nOf course, if Glenn was scared still by the gunpowder, the stage would come to a halt. When that happen, Eliane would proudly announce.\n——Oh, I knew it, you were the fake Lord Ralph! You cannot deceive my eyes!\nThen following by reaching out her hand to Felix in the audience seats to say.\n——While the real Lord Ralph, as you can see… is over there.\nThis way, Felix would be certain to come on stage. Because Felix would never want the play to be canceled.\nThe accident of the gunpowder could be assumed to be an accident caused by a servant's carelessness. And when the play which was almost ruined by such an unfortunate accident was successfully performed by Eliane's quick thinking… everyone would agree that Eliane was a capable woman worthy of Felix. While Glenn Dudley would show his miserable appearance in front of everyone.\nAnd she would let Monica Norton know her place who truly deserved to be Felix's side when all she could do was look at Felix getting on stage.\nWith an enraptured, dreamy smile on her pretty face, Eliane looked down at Glenn from the top of the made-up cliff.",

      "content": "Eliane had miscalculated two things.\nFirst, the basic wind spell she had cast not only knocked down the gunpowder but also brought some oxygen into it which had swelled up the fire.\nSecond, she didn't know that the Silent Witch, the no-chant magician, was presented there.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nWhen Monica noticed that Eliane was casting a wind attack spell on the stage, she instantly made a decision. She had no idea what Eliane was aiming for. In the first place, she was unaware of the explosives that were set up on the stage for the play.\nBut she could tell that Eliane was planning to attack someone, so Monica followed Eliane's gaze. What she was looking at as she uttered the chant was the stage below.\nCould it be that Eliane is targeting Glenn? Judging from her gaze, Monica quickly set up a simple protective barrier around Glenn.\nAnd her judgment had saved Glenn's life.\nWhen the wind spell that Eliane cast had caused the small fire from the staging gunpowder to swell, it had swallowed Glenn within. If Monica hadn't put up a protective barrier, Glenn would have been scorched badly.\nTo those in the audience who didn't know what was going on, these few seconds seemed to be all staged. What they only thought was Amelia's protective barrier had shielded Ralph from the Dark Dragon's flames.\n\"Wow, they didn't only use gunpowders, but magic too?\"\n\"To think they would use actual magic, this year's play is really something!\"\nWhile the audiences were leisurely impressed by their performance, Monica was struggled to keep the play proceeding. After all, the danger on the stage was still not over.\nUnlike fire cast by a spell, gunpowder fire could only burn in the air for a short time. But, it's a different story when it latched into something flammable. And there were many flammable things on the stage, such as paper and wood.\nMonica focused all her attention on extinguishing them.\nThe quickest way to put out a fire is to pour water on it, but that would reveal the spell she cast.\nTherefore, Monica enclosed all the scattered flames within small barriers. It was the same strategy she used to extinguish the Conch Flame. As the fire cannot receive enough oxygen inside the barrier, it became smaller and smaller until it was extinguished.\nAs for Felix who was sitting next to Monica, he was looking at the stage with serious eyes. Unaware that the girl next to him was struggling to extinguish the fire on the stage.\nHow many fires do I have to put out remains!?\nAt that moment, a high-pitched scream sounded from the right side of the stage. The cliff-like set that Eliane was standing on was tilting as one of the pillars supporting the set was on the verge of collapse, charred by the fire.\nOh no!\nIf that set collapsed, it would be a disaster. Not only would it injure Eliane and Glenn, which were standing on top and beneath the set, it would also injure some audiences nearby.\nAnd the moment the set collapsed, Monica, tried to set up a protective barrier for the people in the vicinity. However, she could only maintain another two barriers at the same time. And there were Glenn, Elaine, and the audience—she didn't have enough hands.\nIn the few seconds that Monica was agonizing over her decision, the situation became even worse. The wind had changed direction and the smoke from the staging gunpowder had temporarily covered the stage. This made it impossible to determine the exact location of Glenn and Eliane.\nOn the other side of the smoke, the sound of wood snapping could be heard. There was no time left.\nOh, no! I'm not gonna make it!\nJust as Monica turned pale, something burst out through the smoke.\nIt was Glenn holding Eliane in his arm. He used flight magic to rescue Eliane before flying out of the smoke.\nThe audience was filled with excitement at the rarely seen flight magic.\nIt's my chance!\nMonica quickly put up a protective barrier to keep the crumbling set from falling into the audience. Fortunately, there was no fire in sight.\nI-I've made it in time…\nHolding her racing heart over her uniform, Monica secretly wiped the cold sweat from her face.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nW-What has just happened?\nEliane was just confused as Glenn held her in his arm.\nShe was just trying to surprise Glenn by knocking over a little gunpowder, but the fire from the gunpowder swelled up and scorched part of the set. And what was scorched was the set of cliffs made from a simple wooden platform where Eliane had unfortunately been standing on. If the pillar broke, it would naturally collapse.\nHowever, just before Eliane was thrown to the ground, what was incoming is not the shock of being knocked down into the floor, but a different kind.\nWith a thud sound, her head hit someone's chest and she was carried in his strong arm.\nShe couldn't see anything as the scene in front of her was covered with smoke. But, when she barely opened her eyes as she coughed, what appeared in her sight was a blue sky.\n\"……eh?\"\n\"Phew… That's almost got me.\"\nThe voice was so close that it was almost like a whisper. But then, she was realized that she's being carried in Glenn's arm. Moreover, he was carrying her in the air at that.\nWhat is this? What just happened?\n\"It's dangerous, so please hold me tight, okay?\"\n\"W-What are you…\"\n\"I'm just using a flight spell! Still, they've not told me anything about this kind of play. I wish the director would inform me about this beforehand!\"\nApparently, Glenn believed that this whole crisis was part of the play.\nThere's no way all of this was staged!\nThe smoke had cleared from the stage, revealing the devastation. The cliff set Eliane had been standing on had crumbled into pieces and was scattered across the stage… but fortunately, the damage had not reached the audience. The paper-made Dark Dragon was also safe.\nLooking at this, Elaine secretly patted her chest in relief while Glenn licked his lips.\n\"Well, let's finish up here.\"\n\"…What? Eh?\"\n\"I'm going to swoop in a bit, so hold on tight!\"\nAs he said this, Glenn's body began to dive all the way down toward the stage. Eliane was in a panic and clung to Glenn's neck. She was unwilling to cling to such a man, but she had no choice because she could not maintain a stable position unless she did so.\n\"‘This is the end, Black Dragon!'\"\nRalph's sword pierced the dragon's forehead.\nThe people who had been moving the paper-made dragon shouted its dying cry before withdrawing backstage.\n\"‘Thus, the Hero King Ralph slew the Dark Dragon and brought freedom to the land that had been dominated by it.'\"\nAs soon as the student acting as the narrator read it out, the audience erupted in excitement.\nNone of the history books mention that the Hero King Ralph used flight magic. Nevertheless, Glenn's flying magic had a great impact on the play.\nThe applause directed at the stage was nothing compared to the first half. Everyone was absorbed in the stage and gave out cheers.\nEliane let out a sigh. Then remembered she still had some line remained.\nIn the last scene, Amelia would have given Ralph a compliment and a kiss on the cheek.\nThe idea of giving a kiss to a man who was not Felix, even if it was an act, was unpleasant enough for her. Still, she had to do her part.\nEliane shoved her rising anger and displeasure to the bottom of her stomach and put a beautiful smile on her face.\n\"‘O, King Ralph who blessed by the spirits, let me give you…\"\nStill being held in Glenn's arm, Eliane tried to kiss him on the cheek. Of course, she was planned to stop in midway before it touch.\nBut when Eliane's lips almost reached his cheek, Glenn quickly tilted his head away from Eliane.\nThen Glenn whispered quietly in the ear of the stunned Eliane.\n\"You know, you have to save that thing for someone you love.\"\nEliane turned her head down, her white cheeks quickly turning rosy.\nTo the audience, it looked as if Eliane had turned over in embarrassment. In fact, her body was trembling slightly. However, what was swirling inside Eliane was not embarrassment. It was pure anger.\n…you… you… you dare to decline the kiss which I unwillingly give when you're just a substitute!?\nHer seething anger seemed to crackle in the back of her head.\nYou brought humiliation to me. I won't forgive you. I'll never forgive you, Glenn Dudley.\nIn the midst of the loud cheers, Eliane was quietly igniting the dark flames of her anger.",

      "content": "After the play was over, Felix went backstage and was talking with the person in charge with a grim face. He was probably inquiring about the incident that happened on the stage. As for Monica, she was not sure why Eliane had attacked Glenn but concluded that it was not related to the assassins who were trying to kill Felix, and so she left it at that.\nA small yellow bird landed from the sky and perched on Monica's shoulder. It was Lynn, who had been watching from the top of the tree.\n\"Excellent work on the firefighting.\"\n\"Um, you did notice…?\"\n\"Yes. I debated whether I should lend my assistance, but I'm not very good at settling things quietly.\"\nConsidering all the things she had done so far, including the dynamic landing method of flight magic, she had done the right thing by not asking Lynn for help. Above all, with Felix sitting next to her, Monica couldn't give Lynn any verbal instructions.\nWithout coordination, working alone would be easier to keep things quiet.\n\"While you were working to extinguish the fire, I was keeping an eye out to see if anyone would try to take advantage of the turmoil and harm the second prince, but no one made any suspicious movements.\"\n\"… I see. Thanks.\"\nNonetheless, she could not afford to let her guard down. The school festival was not over yet.\nAs Monica was telling this to herself, she heard a flurry of noisy footsteps. She turned around and saw Glenn rushing towards her in some kind of desperate manner.\nWhat happened to the stage crew who had just surrounded him and praised him for a brilliant performance?\n\"…what's the matter, Glenn?\"\n\"Monica! Please give me some shelter!\"\n\"S-Shelter!?\"\nThe not so peaceful word made Monica flinch.\nGlenn was unusually pale and trembling. What had happened to the man who had just been applauded on stage?\n\"Um… who are you running from?\"\n\"W-Well, actually, I saw my master watching the play…\"\nWhen she heard Glenn mention his master, Monica recalled Felix's words. According to him, Glenn was an apprentice of a renowned magician.\n\"He found out that I broke the \"no flight magic without supervision\" rule. I'm totally screwed up this time, he's definitely mad at me…\"\n\"Is your master… that scary?\"\n\"That person's so scary! He would even grab me by the head and throw me out the window without a second thought!\"\n\"B-But your master… is a magician, right?\"\nAmong his peers, Glenn was a very tall young man. What kind of magician who could grab him and throw him around like that?\nAs Monica imagined his big and muscular master, Glenn looked behind Monica and opened his eyes to the limit.\n\"Aaaaahh! Ma-Ma-Ma…\"\nThen a thud sound was heard.\nIt was the sound of a compressed mass of air being slammed into Glenn's head.\nAs Glen let out a muffled scream and crawled to the ground, a familiar voice sounded from behind Monica.\n\"Well, well, well, Glenn. How dare you run away when you see your master's face?\"\nCould it be, could it be, no way… thought Monica as she turned her head and, as expected, the person she saw standing there was one of the Seven Sages, Louis Miller the [Barrier Magician].\nSmiling elegantly, Louis grabbed the groveling Glenn's head with one hand then dragged him to his feet. What he's doing is almost exactly what a thug would do.\nThe disparity between his beautiful appearance and his behavior was quite a sight to behold.\nNo wonder Glenn was so frightened. If it was Louis, he had the strength to grab and throw him with one hand, moreover, he would not hesitate when doing so. Monica, who understood directly how powerful his grip and arm were and how merciless he was, could not help but shudderingly agreed.\nGlenn, who had been grabbed in the head, was teary-eyed and rattling off excuses.\n\"That flight magic back there was an unavoidable action! If I hadn't used it, I would have been in serious trouble…\"\n\"Sure, of course. I don't blame you for your actions on the stage.\"\nIn contrast to Glenn, who was screaming and crying, Louis had a very elegant tone. That in turn made things feel rather chilly.\n\"Glenn, I heard that you… often use flight magic when going to school from home.\"\n\"*flinch* H-How did you!?\"\n\"I heard about it when I paid my greetings to your parents a while ago. Well, I guess your magic skills must have grown a lot. Putting aside your empty head.\"\n\"Aaaaagh! Owowowowow!\"\n\"Have you forgotten about what you did every single day to the wall of my house when using flight magic? Hah?\"\nThe last part ‘hah?' voiced it in a low tone, and it sounded particularly scary.\nMonica backed away, watching the exchange between the master and disciple, which was very far from heartwarming.\nThen, she whispered to the little bird that perched on her shoulder.\n\"I-I didn't know Glenn was Louis' disciple…\"\n\"You're not aware of the master-disciple relationship between Sir Louis and Sir Glenn?\"\nResponding to Lynn's words with nods, Monica then realized one possibility.\n\"Um, did Glenn aware… of my identity?\"\nMonica and Glenn were both transferred to Serendia Academy at about the same time. Therefore, it was reasonable to assume that the one who'd sent Glenn to this academy was Louis.\n\"Did he send Glenn to enroll in this academy was to support me…?\"\n\"If I may be so bold. Do you think that Sir Glenn is capable of supporting you behind the scenes or performing covert missions?\"\n\"I don't think so…\"\nFor better or for worse, Glenn Dudley is completely honest and cheerful.\n\"According to Sir Louis, he had made Sir Glenn enrolled in this academy to camouflage your infiltration.\"\nAnd that action had made Felix put his guard up because he think that he was a spy that Louis Miller put that spy in his surrounding. If Monica enrolled alone, he might have suspected her as Louis' spy.\nThat's why Louis sent Glenn to enroll in the academy at the same time as Monica.\nNaturally, if his disciple, Glenn enrolled in the academy, Felix would put more attention to him, leaving Monica's enrollment less suspicious.\n\"In this matter, Sir Glenn doesn't know anything.\"\n\"………\"\nIn other words, Louis Miller used his disciple as a decoy for a top-secret mission. How heartless he can be.\n\"I doubt Sir Glenn can keep your identity and the mission a secret if he's aware of it. So, it's safer to leave out the information for him.\"\n\"…I figured.\"\nOut of the corner of Monica's eye, Glenn, who had been tortured by Louis, was crying out \"Mrs. Miller!\" to ask for help from Louis' wife, and was about to get a tongue lashing from Louis.\nIf Monica kept staying here, people would think Louis and her were known to each other. So she apologized to Glenn in her mind and decided to pretend to be a stranger and leave the place.\nAt any rate, she hoped that Glenn won't be punished that badly.\nThe fact Louis and Glenn were master and disciple had surprised her, but inwardly, Monica was so relieved when knowing that Glenn did not know Monica's true identity.\nHe did speak friendly to her was not because of her mission, but because he's that kind person he chatted so friendly with her even when he's unaware of her true identity.\nYou're my friend! Monica's been wondering if his words were a lie, but relieved when realized it's not.\nIf possible, she would like to remain friends with him.\n…I'd better keep my identity secret from him.\nTo her own surprise, Monica found it difficult to let go of her current life.",

      "content": "After having Lynn return to keep an eye on Felix's surroundings, Monica left the outdoor stage. It would look suspicious if she remained there any longer, especially since she was not a member of the stage crew.\nAs she approached the school building, Monica saw Elliot and Benjamin. While she was hesitating if she should greet them, Elliot noticed Monica and approached her.\n\"Hey, Miss Norton. Have you seen Cyril?\"\n\"Lord Cyril? Well… I met him in the school building just after the festival just started… but I haven't seen him since then.\"\nUsually, Vice President Cyril would follow Felix around… or rather, he always sticking close by his side, but today she haven's seen him together.\nRather, ever since she had received the ornament, Monica had not seen Cyril in the school building nor on the outdoor play.\nElliot furrowed his brow and stroked his chin.\n\"I'm not in a hurry, but there's something I need to check with Cyril about before the ball starts… I thought he was working with you, Miss Norton.\"\nAt Elliot's words, Monica widened her eyes while tilting her head in puzzlement.\n\"With me?\"\n\"I mean, you two looked very close to me.\"\n\"Huh? But I thought Lord Cyril's more closer to you rather than me.\"\nNow it's was Elliot's turn that had become amazed at Monica's words.\n\"Me and Cyril? You gotta be kidding me.\"\nNext to the surprised Elliot, Benjamin clapped his hands as if he had realized something.\n\"Oh, right. You were just transferred to this academy recently, Miss Norton. No wonder you don't know how their relationship was last year.\"\n\"…huh?\"\nDid Cyril and Elliot treat each other differently last year than they do now?\nAs far as Monica knew, Cyril and Elliot seemed to be close as usual. Rather, Elliot seems to have a relatively relaxed attitude toward Cyril.\n\"I thought you two were friends…\"\n\"Friends, really? Please cut me some slack.\"\nElliot frowned as he shook his head. Rather than displeasure, he seemed to be saying that he couldn't stand it.\nThen, benjamin explained to the puzzled Monica how their relationship was.\n\"You know how Elliot advocates status supremacy, right? He is proud to be a noble, and at the same time, he doesn't like to see the common people stepping into the noble culture. For me, I'm very pleased to see that song made for common people is accepted by the nobles, but he's too hard-headed to accept it.\"\n\"I-I see…\"\nMonica also understood that.\nElliot does not like the idea of upper-class nobles mixing with middle or lower-class people. Not because he looked down on those in the middle or lower class, but because he thought it best not to encroach on each other's domain in order to do their duty.\nThat's why Elliot disliked Monica and even tried to remove her from the student council. Now, though, he seems to be putting it on hold.\n\"Um, but what relation that has to do with Lord Cyril…\"\n\"Vice President Cyril Ashley is the adopted son of Marquis Highon. Although he's related to them by blood, his father apparently didn't have a peerage.\"\n\"Oh…\"\nMonica couldn't believe her ears for a moment. Of all the people Monica met, Cyril was the ‘most noble' person she knew. How he displays his dignified manner and his bearing. And how refined when he conducted himself.\nSo, she always thought he's a person born and grown in a noble family.\n\"T-Then, what is his connection with Lady Claudia…\"\n\"Oh, the siblings are not related by blood. Miss Claudia is the only child of Marquis Highon, and Cyril was adopted to become their heir.\"\nNow Monica began to understand their relationship.\nCyril was not a noble from born. And Elliot disliked \"those who have climbed the ladder\".\nBenjamin continued to speak, waving his index finger as if he was conducting.\n\"Elliot didn't get along very well with Vice President Ashley, who had just risen ranks… more like he\nwas\nthe one who one-sidedly challenged him.\"\n\"Hey, hey, cut me some slack about the old days.\"\n\"Despite his one-sided challenge, Elliot lost the written test…\"\n\"I.Said.Stop.it.\"\nElliot covered his face with one hand and motioned with his other hand.\nShe couldn't imagine the two of them being on bad terms, but she could sort of imagine Elliot picking on Cyril.\nAfter all, Monica herself had been subjected to Elliott's verbal attack, telling her to ‘know your place.'\n\"After losing all competition in written exams, Elliot, in a very immature way, challenged Vice President Ashley to a chess match. At the time, Vice President Ashley was inexperienced in chess and could not compete with Elliot. Then he said, ‘How can you call yourself the Ashley family name if you can't even play chess properly?'\"\n\"Hey… can we stop with this conversation? I'm aware that was not very mature of me.\"\nElliot awkwardly tried to make an excuse, but once Benjamin's mouth started to roll, he couldn't be stopped.\n\"However, Vice-President Ashley is also a very competitive person, so he did not keep quiet. After studying chess hard for almost a month without sleeping, he challenged Elliot to a rematch and got pretty close to beating him, but due to lack of sleep, he collapsed in the middle of the game… in the end, with President intervened, they made up with each other!\"\nBoth Cyril and Elliot were different in personality, but their pride was equal to each other. It's not hard to imagine that when it comes to a competition, they get fired up and heated up.\nWhen Monica nodded approvingly, Elliot expressed his frustration and made an excuse.\n\"It's not that I made up with him or anything, it's just that I acknowledged how hardworking he was…\"\n\"And so a passionate friendship is formed! Disputes arising from differences in status! The new harmony that comes from competing and improving each other! Oh, it's coming, it's coming, it's coming! The melodies are pouring in! I can make a song out of this… a new song is about to be born…!\"\nElliot looked up to the skies with a sad face at Benjamin, who had tripped into his own world halfway through.\n\"I told you, it's not about friendship or anything! Our relationship is just like I treat you, Miss Norton! It's just a temporary truce to see how things go for now! If he makes a mistake, I'm going to point and laugh at him and say, ‘Look at that, you former commoner!'\"\n\"I-I see…\"\nMonica was not sure if she understood or not, but what she understood was they were not so close to being called friends.\nElliot made a bitter face as he messed up his neatly coiffed amber-colored hair.\n\"Ah, jeez… how did we end up having this conversation? Right. It's your fault, Miss Norton. It's because you mistakenly thought that Cyril and I were friends.\"\n\"I-I'm sorry…\"\nHowever, if someone asks Monica if Elliot and Cyril don't get along, she doesn't think so. Of course, she is not going to say it, because if she did, Elliott would be upset.\n\"In fact, Cyril is much closer to you than he is to me, isn't he, Miss Norton? I mean, you two work together a lot, and… didn't you two go around the school festival together today?\"\n\"No, not really, I only saw him this morning…\"\nWhen Monica shook her head, Elliot turned his attention to the flower ornament on Monica's chest.\n\"But Cyril gave you that flower ornament, didn't he?\"\n\"…? How can you tell?\"\nCome to think of it, she felt that Felix had said the same thing. As she rolled up the ribbon, wondering if Cyril's name was written somewhere on the flower decoration, Elliot rounded his eyes in amazement.\n\"What, you haven't heard of it? Floral ornaments are often matched to the color of the giver's hair and eyes. If the giver's hair color is plain like mine, he might pick a safe choice by choosing a good flower and attaching it to a brown ribbon. In Cyril's case, his hair and eyes quite stand out, so anyone can easily recognize it.\"\n\"I see…\"\nMonica looked down at the flower ornament on her chest carefully. The beautiful pure white roses and blue ribbon reminded her of Cyril's platinum blonde hair and deep blue eyes.\nSuddenly, Monica had an idea.\n\"Oh, I understand… so it's that kind of ‘charm'.\"\n\"‘charm' what?\"\nMonica recalled a book she had once read in Minerva's library.\nIt is said that in a certain region in the southeastern part of the Ridill Kingdom, it was believed that by wearing a part of another person, one could borrow that person's power.\nThis flower ornament was a derivative of that, Monica thought.\n\"If one wears this flower ornament, one can borrow the power of the giver… In other words, it's a \"charm\" that allows you to act like that person!\"\n\"Y-Yeah…?\"\nThat's why Cyril had said that it was a charm to protect her from humiliation, Monica thought to herself.\nIf she could conduct herself as Cyril did, Monica would not disgrace herself at the ball.\n\"I'm feeling a little braver now… If I wear this ornament, I might be able to behave in a dignified manner like Lord Cyril…\"\nElliot looked at Monica with a blank look on his face, but then he slowly bent over and held his stomach, his whole body shaking.\n\"Um, Lord Howard? D-Did you get a stomach ache?\"\n\"No…huhu, hahahahahahaha…no, nothing…hahaha…but, imagining Miss Norton acting like Cyril…what's that, too funny…I can't stop, I'm dying of laughter… huhu!\"\n\"L-Lord Howard? Lord Howard??\"\nMonica was flustered looking at the convulsing-like state of Elliot.\nAs Elliot slowly straightened up, he wiped the tears from his droopy eyes then said.\n\"As for the matter of me and Cyril being close, I'll put that to rest now. Now I have a good story to make fun of him for.\"\n\"…??\"\n\"Anyway, that's it. If you see Cyril, please tell him I'm looking for him. I'll be on the first floor of the school building.\"\n\"O-Okay.\"\nAfter giving a curt bow, Monica left the place with a quick pace\nElliot has a small smile on his mouth as he watched Monica's back.\nReally, not only ‘\nhim'\n, but there's also Cyril or Miss Monica… why do I only get surrounded by strange people like them, I wonder.\nElliot Howard disliked anyone who is not noble to climb over the boundary of their statuses.\nNevertheless, it is also true that he can no longer deny everything about those who have climbed up.\n\"Still, I'm not a fan of commoner music. If you're going to write a song, make it a classy one, Benjamin.\"\nBenjamin did not respond to Elliot's words. After all, he, who was scribbling notes on the ground with a tree branch, had long since tripped into the world of music.",

      "content": "Sorry for the long wait ^0^/. I got caught up in my work and had many things to get it done. So it might take a while before I could post another chapter. Anyway, here's the chapter.\nLeaving Elliot and Benjamin, Monica moved to a less crowded area, and after making sure that no one was watching her, she looked up at the tree.\n\"Nero… are you up there?\"\n\"Yo… I'm here.\"\nNero climbed down from the tree and jumped on Monica's shoulder. Unlike the small bird Lynn, the cat Nero was heavy to a certain extent when he stood on her shoulder, but it was unavoidable to have a private conversation.\n\"Say, Nero, can you use your magic sense to find Lord Cyril?\"\nCyril Ashley has a constitution that absorbs mana in his surrounding. That's why he always carries a brooch that drains excess mana from his body. So the mana concentration around him was a little thick.\nMonica had hoped that Nero, who was skilled at sensing magic, would be able to find him out, but he wagged his tail with a difficult face.\n\"Well, unless he's using magic, finding him would prove a bit difficult. I just can't detect weak mana. But, I can sense it if I get close enough.\"\n\"Then, can I ask you to help me find Lord Cyril?\"\n\"Sure. Did you need something from that chilly guy?\"\nSmiling wryly at Nero's unwillingness to remember people's names, Monica picked him up in her arms. It was about time her shoulders started to get tired.\n\"Lord Howard was looking for Lord Cyril, so I wondered if I could help.\"\n\"You are one busy guy… oh, I've got a response. I felt a little chill mana in that area. It's coming from that big building.\"\n\"Dance hall…?\"\nThe dance hall which is the pride of Serendia Academy was connected to the school building by a corridor. Coincidentally, the current position of Monica and Nero was halfway between the school building and the dance hall. That's probably why Nero was able to sense them.\nThe dance hall has been used for ceremonies and chess tournaments and was also the venue for tonight's ball. It was supposed to be closed now in preparation for the night's ball.\nBut, as a member of the student council, it wouldn't be surprising if he came in and out to help with preparation for the ball, but that job should be Neil's. Why would Cyril be in the dance hall at this time?\nAs Monica cocked her head to the side, Nero tapped Monica's arm.\n\"Hey, Monica. I see some suspicious-looking woman.\"\n\"…huh?\"\n\"Look over there.\"\nLike Nero had pointed with his paw, she saw a woman was walking around restlessly.\nShe's a woman with a slim figure and dark brown hair, wore simple clothes and a stole. Probably in her mid-thirties.\nIf this were a city, there would be nothing wrong with the woman's outfit, but it was too incongruous given that this was the school festival ground of Serendia Academy, where the children of noble families attend.\nMost of the people who come to this invitation-only school festival were either upper-class people or their servants. The woman's outfit did look like neither of them.\n\"She's been acting so suspiciously… Oh! That reminds me, you also act nervously when walking through a crowd!\"\n\"…yeah, sure, I\ndo\nact suspiciously when walking through a crowd.\"\nBut, what Nero said was a fact.\nAfter all, she always keep her head down to avoid eye contact with people, walks along the edge of the street, and moved into a shaded area as if she was afraid of large groups of people. If there's a particularly loud crowd, she would hide reflexively, thus never reaching her destination.\nAnd the way the woman walked was similar to what Monica always does.\n\"No matter how you look at it, she looks suspicious. She might be an assassin.\"\nEven after hearing Nero's insistence, Monica still could not see that woman as an assassin. If she was some kind of assassin, she would have dressed more inconspicuously. And in this kind of place, her plain outfit would only make her presence more stand out.\nAnd her lowered eyebrows and dark expression made her look rather at a loss. Exactly like Monica in the crowd.\nMaybe that woman was in some kind of trouble.\n\"I-I will try to call her out…\"\nIt takes a lot of courage for the timid Monica to talk to someone she has never met before. But she felt she just couldn't leave that woman alone.\nNero looked up at Monica and smiled happily.\n\"I guess you've grown up, haven't you? Alright, go on. go on.\"\nWith that, Nero hopped out of Monica's arms and jumped onto a nearby tree. Nero probably wanted her to go alone without asking his help. So Monica clenched her fists and stepped forth.\nMonica was not very fond of places with many people. She was afraid of crowds. She was afraid of strangers, even until now.\nStill, Monica wanted to become someone like Lana, who could help someone in a crowded place, even if only a little bit.\nI can do it. I've got Lord Cyril's ‘charm' with me.\nShe believed that if it was Cyril, he would lend his hands if he saw the guest in a trouble.\nAfter all, I'm also a member of the student council.\nMonica summoned all her courage to approach the woman and called her out.\n\"E-Excuse me… can I help you with somehhii—?\"\nShe bit her tongue.\nAs Monica was depressed by the reality that she was far from Cyril Ashley's imposing presence, the woman looked at Monica in a perplexed manner.\nShe was a plain, simple-looking woman who looked like she could have been anywhere. To put it another way, she was very similar to Monica.\nThe only feature she has was a dot mark near her lips.\nThe woman lowered her eyelashes once hesitantly and asked Monica in a whisper.\n\"C-Cyril Ashley… D-Do you know where Cyril Ashley is?\"\nMonica widened her eyes at the unexpected name she uttered. Could it be that she was an acquaintance of Cyril's?\n\"U-Um, Lord Cyril is at the main hall…\"\n\"Main hall…?\"\n\"A-Allow me to show you the weeeh—\"\nShe bit her tongue again.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThe woman was walking with her head down next to Monica, glancing around occasionally and then dropping her gaze awkwardly to her feet again.\nMonica hesitated, wondering if she should say something to her, but when she opened her mouth, she closed it, opened it again, then closed it.\nT-This is so awkward…\nNot quite sure what kind of topic she should talk about in these situations.\nWhat would Lana talk about if she was in this kind of situation? Would it be like, ‘that stole looks so lovely, where did you buy it?' then continued with a topic about her outfits.\nIf it were Felix, he would be, ‘did you enjoy our school festival?' or ‘did you watch the stage-play?' while breaching another general topic as he listened for her response.\nIf it were Glenn… well he would ‘please try meats in our store!' or something like that.\nShe tried to imagine what kind of conversation her acquaintances would make in such a situation, but she didn't feel like she could copy any of them.\nIn the end, she couldn't find any topic to talk about as she fumbled her fingers, and the woman who's been glancing at spoke in a whisper.\n\"…A-Are you a student of this school?\"\n\"Y-Yes, I\nam\na student here.\"\nHer uniform had told her that Monica was a student from this school. But, looking at her skinny petite figure might have given her a different impression or so Monica thought.\nHearing Monica's answer, the woman apologized with her downcast eyes.\n\"S-Sorry for asking a rude question… I know your uniform has told me everything, but… well, it just… you feel different from the other students here.\"\nSure enough, from the bystanders' point of view, the commoner Monica attending at Serendia Academy felt so unusual. Even if she's wearing the same uniform, they will naturally recognize something unusual after watching how she conducts herself.\nIncidentally, Monica has the title of \"Count of Magic,\" which is equivalent to the rank of Count, but she often forgets this fact.\n\"…Are you acquaintance with Cyril?\"\n\"Y-Yes. He's always been taking care of me.\"\nMonica nodded vigorously, and the woman's gaze wandered somewhat perplexedly. Before turning her light brown eyes down and looking at her feet.\n\"…Have Cyril's… been acting so overbearing toward… a timid girl like you?\"\n\"N-No…\"\nLeaving Felix aside, not only toward a docile Monica, he acted overbearing mostly toward everyone else.\nMonica pondered for a while.\nIndeed, Cyril is a prideful, high-handed man, she even had a thought that what had stood there was the pride itself wearing clothes.\nThe first time she met him, she was suddenly shackled, treated like a rare animal, and got yelled at most times, so it's normal if she felt scared of him.\nEven so, Monica knew that all these things were not everything about him.\n\"I think Lord Cyril is a kind person. He had taught me how to do my works very, very patiently. When I collapsed, he took over all the work for me… Oh, and he also secretly gave me some delicious chocolate.\"\nThe woman opened her eyes in surprise, looking at Monica.\nMonica puffed out her chest a bit and touched the white rose ornament on her chest with her fingertips.\n\"This flower was also given to me by Lord Cyril. He gave me this flower as a charm so that I wouldn't be faced with embarrassment today.today.\"\n\"…Cyril gave you that… I see…\"\nThe woman's face contorted for a moment as if she were about to cry. Then she shook her head gently and stopped in her tracks.\nThe main hall where Cyril at was just ahead of them. But the woman stopped and didn't try to go any further.\n\"Um, Lord Cyril is in the main hall ahead…\"\n\"No, I think… I still can't face him yet.\"\nSaid the woman as she shook her head slowly, but the face she gave was somewhat calm and relieved.\n\"I'm sorry for stopping halfway even after you did show me the way.\"\n\"I-It's okay…\"\nThe woman turned her back to the main hall and started walking away. She stopped midway and looked at Monica.\n\"Thank you for calling out to me, a very kind girl.\"\n\"No, um, I'm sorry I can't be of much help…\"\nThe woman smiled faintly when Monica's gaze darted around shyly.\n\"I'm glad I talked to you. If that child… could be so kind to a child like you…\"\nThe last word she muttered was spoken softly to herself, then, the woman started walking again, without looking back to the main hall again.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nPeeking into the small gap of the door of the main hall she opened, Monica saw Cyril and Neil busily giving instructions to the servants.\nAfter all, there are many things to be confirmed before the last minute of the ball, such as the final confirmation of food and drinks, the number of dishes, the position of the orchestra, the arrangement of chairs, and so on.\nAs she was wondering if she should call out to him since he seemed so busy, Neil who noticed Monica, called out to her.\n\"What's the matter, Miss Norton?\"\n\"Oh, um, I, um, I have a matter to talk to Lord Cyril about…\"\nNeil immediately called for Cyril after hearing Monica's hesitant answer. And Cyril stopped checking his list and walked quickly towards Monica.\n\"Treasurer Norton. Did some trouble occur at the school building?\"\n\"No, it's not that, it's just Lord Howard was looking for you and wanted you to confirm something before the ball, so he asked me to contact you. He said he would be on the first floor of the school building…\"\n\"Confirmation? …oh, I think he needs me to check for any changes in the orchestra arrangement. Okay, I'll be there soon after I finish checking here.\"\nCyril was really busy. And Monica didn't think it was a good idea to hold him to tag along with her conversation.\nBut she felt she really should tell him about that woman, so while fumbling her fingers, Monica opened her mouth.\n\"And, um… just a while ago, I met with a woman guest… apparently, she seems to be looking for you, Lord Cyril.\"\n\"Looking for me?\"\n\"I'm sorry. I forgot to ask her name… but she has olive-colored hair… right, she also has a mole on her mouth.\"\nCyril, who had been furrowing his brow quizzically, took a short breath and slowly opened his eyes.\n\"Where's that woman now?\"\n\"Well, I was with her a while ago, but she said she couldn't see you yet, so she left not a long ago…\"\nCyril's face contorted for a moment at Monica's words.\n\"…So, she's come.\"\nThat small almost inaudible murmur was not meant for Monica to hear, it was more of muttering to himself.\n\"Lord Cyril?\"\nMonica looked up at him confusedly, and Cyril bowed deeply.\n\"Thank you, for escorting my precious guest.\"",

      "content": "——Monica likes it when Cyril addresses her as \"Treasurer Norton\". Because it makes her feel like she's been accepted as one of the student council members.\n\"Just because I called you differently, you're treating me like a stranger?\" said the man who resembled Cyril while glaring at Monica from the inside of the lightning cage. And Monica gave a cold look at him.\n\"…I suggest you stop impersonating Lord Cyril.\"\nThat person may look similar to Cyril. And most people might have been deceived by his face—but, Monica who's good at spotting the difference, that trick will not work on her.\nJust like when she instantly found the imbalance in the ledger, she could recognize that the person in front of her was an imposter.\nFirst thing first, there was a slight discrepancy at the portion of his torso. Considering how Monica had a habit to remember a person by the numbers—like the length and thickness of the limbs of people around her—she can't be deceived even he'd skillfully dressed himself some clothes and boots to make it similar.\nSecond, the real Cyril Ashley had a constitution that will always absorb mana around him, so he's constantly releasing mana out of his body by using a brooch magic tool. If he was the same Cyril she met at the hall earlier, she would sense some mana he had released, but she didn't. The brooch he wore had a similar design, but not the kind of a magic tool.\nAnd last…\n\"… each person has different shape of ears.\"\nAfter hearing Monica's words, the man cupped his hand on his ear.\nShe couldn't see through his disguise at the chess tournament because she didn't know Eugene Pittman in person. But, if it were someone she knew—Monica was confident she would be able to distinguish it.\n\"Also… You might have been able to change your face skillfully with a body manipulation spell. But your modification didn't extend to your ears… a crude work, if I would say.\" said Monica indifferently like cornering her enemy with her move in the chess, and the man's profile changed in an instant.\n\"Ha… Haha…\"\nThe lips of the man in front of her slowly lifted up to carve a smile like a crescent moon. The laughter overflowing from his lips was sweet as if honey had been boiled down and burnt.\n\"A crude work? Wouldn't a person who remembers even the shape of her acquaintance's ears considered be unusual? That's so creepy… but, as expected of the Seven Sages, I suppose.\"\nNoticing her shoulder jolted, the man smiled even deeper and he licked his lips.\n\"I was a little doubtful, but I guess I was right… I still can't believe it, to be honest. I didn't expect that Monica Everett of the Silent Witch, one of the Seven Sages, was such a little girl!\"\nShe had expected her identity was exposed by that man. After all, there is only one person who could use the no-chant spells. After concluding there's no reason for her to hide her identity anymore, she opened her mouth.\n\"…stop speaking using that face.\"\n\"Nooope. I'd love this face, you know. Just look at this beautiful face… it made me so envious.\" said the man as he stroked the face which resembled Cyril while sighing like an enraptured person.\nThat gesture felt so uncomfortable. And for some reason, Monica felt so irritated.\n\"…cease your resistance and surrender yourself.\"\n\"*snicker* but I.Re.Fuse.\"\nStill caught inside the lightning cage, the man waved his right sleeve swiftly. What was coming out from it were dozes of tiny spiders, which were slipping through the gap of the lightning cage, latching onto Monca's face down to the neck. And the expression of \"Cyril\" who did that warped into a wicked smile. (TL: BURN IT WITH FIREEEE!!)\n＊ ＊ ＊\nYuan—the man who transformed into Cyril—smiled confidently after assuring his victory was certain.\nWhile Monica was preoccupied with the spider he had released from his sleeve, Heidi jumped in as she opened the door. Yuan had made Heidi dressed in Serendia Academy school uniform and had her standby in the hallway. So when she came, she had finished her chant to launch an attack spell.\nJust like chess, every move in this battle was fixed. There might be some exceptions, but a magician can only use two spells at the same time.\nIf a knight fights with a sword and shield in his right and left hands, then a magician's tactic is to simultaneously deploy offensive and defensive spells.\nSo while Silent Witch currently maintaining the lightning cage to trap Yuan with ‘one hand'. Yuan, using mana manipulation released spiders from his sleeve to force Silent Witch to use her other hand. And when Silent Witch used both of her hands, she would have no means of preventing Heidi's attack and will be left defenseless and vulnerable to attack.\nEven she's the no-chant genius magician if they can catch her by surprise when she was maintaining two spells at the same time, they still can defeat her.\n\"Pierce through, Ice Spear.\"\nHeidi aimed her ice spear toward Silent Witch.\nUnfortunately for her… the current Silent Witch hadn't put any attention to the spiders Yuan had released. Let alone lose consciousness.\nMost people feel disgusted and disturbed when dozens of spiders were thrown at them while they crawl all over their skin. And he thought a little girl like her would be in tears and panicking.\nHowever, Monica Everett of the Silent Witch only glanced at the spider and after confirming it was not poisonous, she did not shake it off or scream but looked at Heidi with a poker face.\nThen, while maintaining the lightning cage that restrains Yuan, she canceled out the ice spear that Heidi released with her fire magic. While ignoring a countless number of spiders cling to her face and neck.\nHeidi immediately pulled out a hidden knife and attacked Silent Witch, but by the time she took out the knife, Silent Witch had already unleashed her next spell.\n\"Heidi! Watch your feet!\" shouted Yuan who had noticed, but it was too late.\nJust like a spider web, Silent Witch stretched out a thread of lightning from the lightning cage where Yuan trapped, to ensnare Heidi's feet.\nHeidi, who was too late to notice, touched the thread of lightning at her feet then collapsed to the floor after her whole body convulsing.\n\"…a-ah… Y-Yuan… I-I'm sorry…\"\nSilent Witch picked up a knife that Heidi dropped, then gazed at both of them expressionlessly.\nStanding in the center of the thread of lightning that spread out like a spider's web with her face covered with spiders, her image resembled a spider incarnate.\nHer young, naive face gazed at Yuan and Heidi with a horrifyingly blank expression. It was just like a spider catching a butterfly entangled in its thread to eat it mercilessly.\nWithout changing her expression, Silent Witch waved her finger. A lightning thread, which had been like a spider's web, changed its shape again and became a cage surrounding Heidi.\nThe witch, who had trapped Yuan also successfully restrained Heidi.\nLike the time when she completely defeated her opponent in a chess tournament. She had shown her opponent, expressionlessly, emotionlessly, and ruthlessly, how overwhelming the difference between their power was.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nMonica stared silently at the spider crawling on her skin as it lost its strength and fell to the ground with a flop.\nThis spider was just a corpse from the beginning. That man, who was called Yuan, had put magic into the spider's carcass and temporarily controlled it.\nMonica might haven't seen it, but the spider on Felix's shoulder was also one of these. If it were a normal spider, it wouldn't have died from being thrown at the window. But it fell down because the supply of magic was cut off and turned back into a corpse. If anything, the goal of manipulating a non-poisonous spider could only be for a diversion. And Monica knew that, so she didn't use her magic to get rid of the spiders.\nMonica quietly brushed off the spider carcass that was still stuck to her skin.\n\"…Spider would never scare me.\"\nAfter all, the thing that frightened Monica most is always people.\nEven the word ‘justice' that had no malice would make people trample innocent people or even kill them.\nTo Monica Raine, who has her father taken away from these terrifying people, she was hoping all of them to disappear.\nTo Monica Norton, who had found her precious friend in the Serendia Academy changed her thinking, she wants to protect all these people.\nAnd so, Monica Everett made one conclusion.\n\"I don't fear spiders nor dragons, but human… it's the most terrifying thing to me. That's why I think I could hurt or even do something worse.\"\n\"Is that supposed to be a threat? What do you mean by ‘do something even worse'? Are you going to torture me?\"\n\"Cyril\" sneered at Monica.\nIs a little girl like her can even bear doing the torture thing, in the first place?\nIn front of that man, Monica formulated a spell. Since Monica didn't imbue her spell with mana, it wouldn't be activated. But, Yuan and Heidi who heard Monica's chant, their complexion change drastically.\nMonica was planning to cast the kind spell that banned in the Ridill Kingdom, a mind spell. It was a spell to dominate and control people to your bidding. With that spell, she could make them tell her everything.\nStruggling a bit, Yuan opened his mouth.\n\"…hey, hey, should that spell supposed to be forbidden in this country?\"\n\"Among the forbidden books that only the Seven Sages could read, there was a book that described the mind-involving spell. Once you know the theory, it's not hard to reproduce.\"\nIf Yuan resisted, she would not hesitate to use the forbidden spell. So, if he didn't want to be turned into a vegetable, he should answer her everything, or so Monica threatened. But Yuan raised his head and laughed.\n\"Aha… hahaha… I thought you're just a little girl… but also a crazy one at that, huh. To think you could pluck out someone else life emotionlessly like a chess piece. I guess that's your true nature, am I right, Monica Everett of the Silent Witch?\" confronted \"Cyril\" in Monica's ruthless manner. And maybe what he said was not wrong.\nMonica, who only sees people as numbers, could hurt people without feeling anything.\nAnd she's able to do it.\nNo matter how much she tries to imitate Lana, she will never be able to be like Lana.\n…Even then.\nAs long she could protect people she care about, she would pluck everything that threatened her friends, even it would make her being called a merciless witch.\n\"…this is your last chance… tell me your goal, all of it.\"\n\"Hey, Silent Witch… do you know what the real Cyril is doing right now?\"\nThe last time Monica saw Cyril was at the ballroom. She has not seen him since then.\nAnd Yuan didn't miss it when Monica twitched her shoulder.\n\"I had my people monitoring him right now. If anything happens to me… they will kill the owner of this face.\"\nTrying to imitate Cyril's manner, Yuan expressed his stubbornness with a smile.\n\"…You will release this cage for me, right?\"\n\"………\"\nAfter a few seconds of conflict in her mind, Monica released the lightning cage.\nYuan pushed the defenseless Monica down to the floor, mounted her, and held her wrists.\n\"The crueler you can be for someone else, the more that someone else will drag you down, don't you think that's ironic?\"\nEven if she can't move right now, Monica still can kill this man.\nBut if Monica harmed this man, Cyril would die.\nHeidi got up and put a handkerchief soaked in the drug over Monica's mouth.\n\"Mm! Mmmm!\"\nIt was the kind of drug that would make a person who smelled its strong odor lose consciousness. Even after trying to hold her breath, a small sniff still made her very dizzy.\nIf her consciousness got more clouded, she would unable to cast spells, and the situation will be worsened.\nMonica tried to resist but the smile on Yuan's face which resembled Cyril's turned more twisted.\nThen he leaned forward and ran his tongue down Monica's neck as she struggled to hold her breath.\n\"Mmm!?\"\nMonica screamed and unconsciously inhaled the drug hard in the spur of the moment. The back of her head went numb and her vision distorted languidly.\nShe can't calculate accurately. The beautiful mathematical formulas that run through her head, the magic formulas, were distorting and collapsing.\n\"…mm… m…\"\nYuan licked his lips as he watched Monica letting inaudible voices before she stopped her resistance and give in to the drug.\n\"You know, I am more experienced in doing some cruel thing to people. Now, let's do some cruel thing, shall we?\"",

      "content": "——Monica likes it when Cyril addresses her as \"Treasurer Norton\". Because it makes her feel like she's been accepted as one of the student council members.\n\"Just because I called you differently, you're treating me like a stranger?\" said the man who resembled Cyril while glaring at Monica from the inside of the lightning cage. And Monica gave a cold look at him.\n\"…I suggest you stop impersonating Lord Cyril.\"\nThat person may look similar to Cyril. And most people might have been deceived by his face—but, Monica who's good at spotting the difference, that trick will not work on her.\nJust like when she instantly found the imbalance in the ledger, she could recognize that the person in front of her was an imposter.\nFirst thing first, there was a slight discrepancy at the portion of his torso. Considering how Monica had a habit to remember a person by the numbers—like the length and thickness of the limbs of people around her—she can't be deceived even he'd skillfully dressed himself some clothes and boots to make it similar.\nSecond, the real Cyril Ashley had a constitution that will always absorb mana around him, so he's constantly releasing mana out of his body by using a brooch magic tool. If he was the same Cyril she met at the hall earlier, she would sense some mana he had released, but she didn't. The brooch he wore had a similar design, but not the kind of a magic tool.\nAnd last…\n\"… each person has different shape of ears.\"\nAfter hearing Monica's words, the man cupped his hand on his ear.\nShe couldn't see through his disguise at the chess tournament because she didn't know Eugene Pittman in person. But, if it were someone she knew—Monica was confident she would be able to distinguish it.\n\"Also… You might have been able to change your face skillfully with a body manipulation spell. But your modification didn't extend to your ears… a crude work, if I would say.\" said Monica indifferently like cornering her enemy with her move in the chess, and the man's profile changed in an instant.\n\"Ha… Haha…\"\nThe lips of the man in front of her slowly lifted up to carve a smile like a crescent moon. The laughter overflowing from his lips was sweet as if honey had been boiled down and burnt.\n\"A crude work? Wouldn't a person who remembers even the shape of her acquaintance's ears considered be unusual? That's so creepy… but, as expected of the Seven Sages, I suppose.\"\nNoticing her shoulder jolted, the man smiled even deeper and he licked his lips.\n\"I was a little doubtful, but I guess I was right… I still can't believe it, to be honest. I didn't expect that Monica Everett of the Silent Witch, one of the Seven Sages, was such a little girl!\"\nShe had expected her identity was exposed by that man. After all, there is only one person who could use the no-chant spells. After concluding there's no reason for her to hide her identity anymore, she opened her mouth.\n\"…stop speaking using that face.\"\n\"Nooope. I'd love this face, you know. Just look at this beautiful face… it made me so envious.\" said the man as he stroked the face which resembled Cyril while sighing like an enraptured person.\nThat gesture felt so uncomfortable. And for some reason, Monica felt so irritated.\n\"…cease your resistance and surrender yourself.\"\n\"*snicker* but I.Re.Fuse.\"\nStill caught inside the lightning cage, the man waved his right sleeve swiftly. What was coming out from it were dozes of tiny spiders, which were slipping through the gap of the lightning cage, latching onto Monca's face down to the neck. And the expression of \"Cyril\" who did that warped into a wicked smile. (TL: BURN IT WITH FIREEEE!!)\n＊ ＊ ＊\nYuan—the man who transformed into Cyril—smiled confidently after assuring his victory was certain.\nWhile Monica was preoccupied with the spider he had released from his sleeve, Heidi jumped in as she opened the door.

      "content": "\"‘The more a person has been oppressed and hurt, the more will he understand the pain of others'—You know, I hate that person who says that line the most.\"\nLooking into Monica's muddled face closely, Yuan shoved his finger into Monica's mouth, then stirred it calmly.\nHearing Monica's groan, Yuan's smirk broadened, turning it into a crescent moon.\n\"But from my understanding, the more a person has been oppressed and hurt, the more he knows how to trample and hurt others. Isn't that the case with you, The Human Hating Silent Witch?\"\nHis slim fingertips carefully traced her rows of teeth. He then teasingly plucked Monica's small tongue with his fingertips.\n\"I guess you didn't hide any self-poison behind your teeth.\"\n\"…*groan*…\"\nMonica let out a weak groan and Yuan released his fingers from Monica's tongue. After that, he trailed his finger over Monica's frail body, then continued by stroking up Monica's neck and thin belly as he enjoyed the small shiver she gave each time.\n\"Now, I wonder what should I do with her… Since my job is done, you don't mind if I have a little fun with her, do you?\"\n\"Have you confirmed that matters?\"\n\"Yeah, I've confirmed it at a close range after pretending to be getting rid of a spider from him. It's the work of the traitor Arthur…\nThat\nperson's prediction was right.\"\nWhat were they talking about? That thought raced in Monica's mind as she tried hard to hold in her consciousness.\nConsidering how many times he's got a chance to kill Felix when he approached him, everybody had thought that the goal of the man called Yuan was to assassinate him, even Monica also did think so. And yet it ended after he's done confirming on some matter.\nWhat did he want to confirm to even have taken the trouble and effort to kill Eugene Pittman, took his place, and approached him as Cyril Ashley?\nDid their goal to approach His Highness was truly to confirm on some matters? But, for what reason? Also, who's that Arthur person?\nWith her dulled thought, Monica can't connect all these pieces of information even when she wants to. It's just like scooping water with bare hands, even you could contain it, the clues she had assembled, in the end, will slip away through the fingers gaps. Even so, she still holding her consciousness, but then Yuan stroked her cheek caressingly.\n\"Now, what should I do with this girl? I'd like to teach her various things, from pain to ecstasy… but\nthat\nperson might desire to have her talent on his side.\"\n\"I think feeding her some drug and discipline in between regularly would prove a better choice to make her obey.\"\n\"You're right. It might be troublesome if she put some resistance later. Let's do your suggestion.\"\n\"Well then, I will prepare the drug…\"\nHeidi took out a small medicine bottle from her pocket and opened the lid. The drug was different from what she used on the handkerchief earlier, it was more potent and addictive.\nOnce a person ingests the drug, he will be filled with a strong sense of intoxication, but when the drug wears off, he will experience withdrawal symptoms and crave more of the drug. The end result of a person who is addicted to this drug is… a cripple.\nMonica quickly gritted her teeth and tried to resist.\nHowever, with no strength in her mouth, Yuan easily pried it open and Heidi was placing the medicine bottle near Monica's mouth.\nThe thick, viscous liquid was about to fall into Monica's mouth.\n…n-no…\nTears welled up in the corners of Monica's eyes—and then, *shatter*, the window crashed open and a man jumped in. He's a wavy black-haired man with glittering golden eyes, dressed in old-fashioned clothes.\nIn the situation where a bottle of medicine was hanging near her face and the lips of her were wet, Monica let out a faint voice.\n\"Ne… Ro…\"\nNero, who had been transformed into a human, used his inhuman leaping ability to leap from the window frame to Monica at once and mercilessly kicked out at Heidi, who was attempting to drug Monica.\nYuan reacted as quickly as he could and pointed his knife at Nero. However, Nero grabbed Yuan's wrist holding the knife and punched him hard in the face with his other hand.\nNero lifted Monica up from the floor and sniffed her.\nHis nose immediately noticed the source of the strange smell. It was the drug that Heidi had tried to feed Monica. And some small amount of that highly viscous liquid had spilled on Monica's lips.\nNero bent down and licked the potion off Monica's lips.\nHeidi's eyes widened in disbelief when she saw the scene.\n\"That drug would rob people's consciousness in one lick, how can you…\"\n\"A drug on this level won't work on me.\"\nNero snorted as he glared at Heidi and Yuan while holding Monica tightly.\n\"You lowly human, how dare you to hurt my master… I hope you're prepared to be shredded without leaving a speck of single dust,\" spoke Nero as he let out a deep hissing sound like a lizard. His transformation was almost released because of his anger. And his skin, which had taken on the appearance of a human, was now overlapped with something black. Both Yuan and Heidi who watched that deformed figure can't utter any word.\nAt that moment, a voice that could only be heard by Nero and Monica resonated directly in their eardrums. It was Lynn.\n\"Sir Nero, we have yet to confirm Cyril's safety. And Sir Louis is still swearingly looking for him at the moment. So, please endure it for a while longer…\"\nLynn must have been listening to all their conversations in this classroom. Moreover, she also coordinated with Louis to find Cyril.\nUnfortunately, Nero couldn't care less about Lynn and Louis' circumstances.\n\"I don't want to. Besides Monica, I don't care what will happen to other humans.\"\nNero's golden pupils narrowed into vertical slits which were impossible for humans. And that inhuman gaze was preying upon both Heidi and Yuan.\n\"I have no interest in both of you and I won't listen to your pleading. So, die.\"\nInside his vicious mouth were glaringly sharp teeth.\nHolding Monica in one hand, Nero bent forward and rushed over on Yuan, then grabbed his face using his other hand.\nBut Nero furrowed his brows after getting an unpleasant feeling when Yuan's head almost touched the wall behind.\n\"What's this…\"\nThe feeling when his fingers dug into Yuan's face was like grabbing clay.\nNero released his grasping and Yuan put his hands on his warped face. There was no longer any trace of Cyril Ashley's face on his face.\n\"Aw~, you're so mean. Sculpting this face is not easy, you know.\"\nHis warped lips had made his voice sound distorted. As if patching skins onto his skull, he kneaded his face to arrange his distorted skin with both of his hands. When he's done, what appeared there was not the face they knew. Monica couldn't tell if that flat face which was not common in this country, belonging to Yuan himself or a stranger's face.\n\"What was that. It's so gooey and it's so gross.\"\nBut when Nero was planning to crush the newly appeared Yuan's face, Monica managed to squeeze her voice out of her half-dazed consciousness.\n\"…N-Nero…be careful… he's using a body modification spell…\"\nA body modification spell is a spell to strengthen or manipulate the body by pouring mana into it. However, because of the side effect of mana poisoning, its usage was forbidden in this country.\nMonica had read a book about body modification spell that was available within the Seven Sages' authority. According to it, the spell can only be used on the skin to stop bleeding or remove an old scar.\nI've never seen or heard a spell that can manipulate the shape of a face at will.\nWhen Nero saw Yuan was using a spell that was out of their understanding, he knew he can't let his guard down. So he stopped his attempt and watched closely at Yuan's and Heidi's movements, especially at Yuan's body modification spell.\nOn the other hand, Yuan and Heidi didn't try to attack right away. They must have realized that Nero was not an ordinary person. They were on alert and searching for a way to get out of this situation.\nSo Yuan approached a new proposal.\n\"Hey, dark-haired guy. Wanna make a deal with me? I'll give you the antidote of that drug for that Silent Witch, but in exchange, will.you.let.us.go?\" said Yuan as he took a small bottle from his pocket, flashing it toward Nero.\nBut what appeared on Nero's face was only a vicious smile.\n\"I only make a deal with someone I acknowledged. If you have the antidote, I just have to take it by force and kill you.\"\n\"Oh, I'm so scaaared~ I will do this, then~\"\nThe small bottle slipped off from his hand. It fell and broke after hitting the floor and the liquid inside scattered across… in an instant, the classroom was filled with white smoke. It had a pungent smell which was probably some kind of poison.\n\"For your information, Heidi and I have some resistance toward poisons, so this smoke won't affect us… but what about her? I guess it will be painful for her.\"\n\"!\"\nNero immediately turned his gaze toward Monica in his hand. Unlike Nero who's had resistance toward poisons, Monica's resistance was the same as a normal human. Especially when she had been subjected to another drug, so taking any other poison would only worsen her condition.\nMaybe because she had inhaled some smoke, she was writhing, scratching her throat in agony.\nNero clicked his tongue and jumped out the window to escape from the poisonous smoke while Yuan's high-pitched laugh echoed at his back.\n\"Farewell, Silent Witch, and you too, Mr. Knight. I hope you find the horrible truth shrouding around us, if that happens, let's meet again in the future.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nNero carried Monica to the old garden which was less crowded. As the day ended and the sun had already set more than halfway, the night breeze blew in the garden. Nero wrapped Monica's body in his robe, sat down by the broken fountain. Then, a yellow bird came down and transformed into a beautiful maid.\nLindbergfield, a contracted spirit of Louis Miller, placed her hand on the ragged breathing Monica's mouth.\n\"I supplied her some clean oxygen to ease her breathing.\"\n\"Will it restore Monica's condition?\"\nNero stared at Lynn doubtfully to which she responded with a shook.\n\"It can only aid her breathing, not curing her poison. From her condition, she was not afflicted with a strong poison. The effect of the poison should be gone after resting for a half-day and she will back to normal.\"\nWhile Lynn was giving Nero an explanation, Monica weakly opened her eyes to ask her.\n\"…Lynn… h-have you found… Cyril…\"\n\"We've taken him in our care. The case of he had another comrade might only a bluff.\"\n\"…H-How… is His Highness escorting…\"\n\"No problem, it's been handled by Sir Louis. He's been secretly watching him around very closely while complaining about how cold it is.\"\n\"…T-Then… h-have you captured those two…\"\nConsidering the situation, the best option was to have one of Louis or Lynn guard Felix, while the other one is to chase Yuan and Heidi.\nDespite being aware that it will let them escape, Louis still sent Lynn to go to Monica's place instead of chasing them. It was an unusual choice, considering how his behavior was.\n\"Sir Louis ordered me to assist Silent Witch as first priority. He has considered that losing you would prove more damaging than letting the enemies escape.\"\n\"Louis must be angry… letting the enemies escape…\"\n\"He might appear angry, but I could sense he also worried about you.\"\n\"…ahaha… that's very Louis-like.\"\nMonica regulated her breathing as she gave her a wry smile. Just breathing alone has made her very nauseous at first, but it was much better now. Maybe the poison was not so potent in the first place. After resting for a bit, she should be able to walk again.\nAs Monica shifted her body to see how far she could move, Nero hugged her tightly.\n\"With the maid woman here, we can use her flight spell to move you to your attic room. But you have to rest for now. It will be trouble if you collapsed in the midway.\"\n\"…no, I have to go… to Lana's room… I need to make a preparation…for the ball.\"\nHearing Monica's words, Nero gawked at her.\n\"Hah!? What can you do with that weak body?!\" shouted Nero at her and Lynn also nodded in agreement.\n\"Please rest assured, you can leave the guarding of the second prince at the ball to us. In the meantime, you should take proper rest.\"\n\"I'm sorry… for making you guard the second prince when it's not your responsibility… but this is my selfish request.\"\nIn the almost crying state, Monica's face crumpled and she muttered.\n\"And I might not be there in the next year's ball.\"\nLike Yuan had told her. Monica Everett of the Silent Witch treats humans mercilessly. And it was a fact she can't refute. She was a witch who is terrified of human beings, because of it she can be so cruel toward them and only see them as nothing but numbers.\nMonica closed her eyes, thinking about all the treasures she had obtained.\nLana gave her a letter and a ribbon.\nFelix gave her a necklace.\nCasey gave her a handmade handkerchief.\nEven the white rose ornament attached to her chest was given by someone.\nAll of these things were not something they had addressed to Silent Witch. But a gift for a little girl named Monica Norton. At some point, she might not be able to part with the identity of Monica Norton and the time she spent as her. Despite being aware that she had lied to everybody.\nI'm sorry, I'm sorry. At least… please let me be Monica Norton while I'm only at this school.\nTo which person did she apologize?\nIs it to Louis who gave her the mission?\nIs it to Nero and Lynn for the troubles she had caused to them?\nOr, is it to her friends whom she had lied to?\nPerhaps it was to all of them.\nBut I still want to be Monica Norton… even only for a little longer.",

      "content": "After convincing Nero and Lynn to bring her to Lana's room, she met Lana with her eyes widened.\n\"…You don't seem to be okay. Hey, are you sure you're not feeling sick? Wanna rest for a bit?\"\nTo keep up with the appearance she tried to keep her back straight, but looking prospectively, her pale face told otherwise. She didn't seem really fine.\nShe told Lana that it was her first time at the school festival and she's been having fun too much before asking her to dress her up.\nThe leaf-colored dress that Lana lent to Monica was originally designed for a child, but Lana's father had arranged a seamstress to alter the design and make some adjustments.\nHe might have simplified the design of the upper dress, but the large lace on the chest part made it looks classy and refined. On the lower part, a draped skirt flowed down with a big ribbon attached to the left waist, leaving an image of billowy waves with every step she took and it was beautiful.\nAll of these aspects had made the dress looks cute yet not childish. Showing its gorgeousness but not extravagant.\nWith every part of the design had been calculated to the minute details, it had produced the dress that even Monica, who's not familiar with this kind of thing, could honestly say it suited her very well.\nTo make it better, Lana also tied a ribbon in the same color as her dress and braided it together with Monica's hair. After braiding it to the side, she loosened some of it.\n\"…are you planning on something with that part?\"\n\"Hehe. You can expect something on this.\"\nLana smiled complacently before twirling the loosened part and binding it with a hairpin. Once the whole thing was in place, the organized hair turned into the shape of a flower.\n\"It's beautiful! My hair looks like a flower!\"\n\"This hairstyle is on the hit these days.\"\nEven Lana's hairstyle which she proudly displayed had been arranged in the same style as Monica's. It made Monica grin unconsciously.\n\"…hehe, we've got the same hairstyle.\"\n\"I-I guess we might look like sisters.\"\n\"Yeah… ehehe.\"\nThe hairstyle Lana had arranged will look good even without the hairpin, if anything, it was her skillful hands that made it so gorgeous.\nTo finish it off, Lana applied makeup to Monica's face, which was more glamorous than during the chess tournament, then pinned a white rose ornament to her chest.\nThe simple design on the upper part of the dress made the white rose ornament look more distinct against the leaf-colored fabric.\n\"And Lord Cyril would be delighted too,\" added Lana as she closed the makeup kit as Monica wondered in puzzlement.\nWhy would Lord Cyril be delighted?\nIf she dressed up properly, she wouldn't embarrass the student council, and Lord Cyril will be delighted too.\nWhile Monica convinced herself so, Lana looked at the white rose ornament and smirked.\n\"Do your best!\"\n\"O-Okay…?\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nEliane Hyatt had prepared a new dress just for today's ball. The fluffy pink dress, which was tailored by a renowned seamstress, brought out her dainty and delicate charm to the fullest.\nWith her downy, light brown hair beautifully groomed and a flower ornament was attached to it, making her beauty was comparable to a fairy queen, or so what the servants praised.\nNaturally, once Eliane stepped into the venue, everyone will pay attention to Eliane…\n\"Still, the ball feels more delightful when Miss Graham comes….\"\n\"Miss Ashley is so beautiful today, too… her presence alone makes the atmosphere around her like a different world.\"\nHer hands quivered when she heard these comments.\nFollowing people's gazes, what came first into her view was the secretary of the student council, Bridget Graham chatting amicably with the guests. She wore a maroon-colored dress interwoven with gold and silver threads, a dress which not many people can wear but it suited her perfectly. And the most eye-catching thing about her was her glamorous beauty and her beautiful golden curly hair, which matched her gorgeous dress. The fact that she didn't look vulgar even when wearing such a fancy dress was probably due to her refined and dignified behavior. Especially her ability to grasp the identity and background of the guest to tailor the conversation to their interest, it was not something anyone can imitate.\nFollowing that, there's a girl with a listless look leaned back on the sofa for a rest. She was the daughter of Marquis Highon, Claudia Ashley. The royal blue dress she wore elegantly accentuated the lines of her slender body. Her lustrous black hair was beautifully tied up and held in a large hair ornament, with a single strand hanging down from the side. Even that strand of hair looked beautiful, perhaps because of her mysterious beauty. She sat there with a doll-like expressionless face, but when she's moving or blinked just a little, the young men around her looked at her passionately, as if they were expecting something.\nEven at the glamorous evening party, both Bridget and Claudia's beauties stood out.\nEliane is one of the three most beautiful girls in the school, along with Bridget and Claudia. However, when comparing their beauty, people always place her beneath the two—she can't escape the frame of being an adorable young lady.\nIn the first place, the only reason she was selected as the three most beautiful young ladies in the academy was her background as the same family as Felix's which made her popularity rise.\n…so what? Family background and characters also can become aspects to evaluate a young lady. I come from a nobler family than any of them and my behavior is also not inferior to theirs.\nFor example, when Eliane smiled, the young men around her immediately smitten over and came to gather around her.\nShe's just like a spring fairy in the book. How lovely she can be. Just looking at her charm almost made me have a heart attack—Feeling better at such words, Eliane took a side glance at Felix.\nShe easily spotted Felix's figure. As he has a more overwhelming presence than anyone else in the venue, it was not difficult to find him.\nShe would have liked to approach Felix and ask his thought on her dress, but he was still talking with the teachers. It would have been unbecoming of a young lady to interfere forcibly here. The right choice was to approach Felix discreetly and naturally, then wait for him to call to her first.\nAfter all, Eliane is the most suitable partner for Felix and would never be ignored by him.\n…what is that?\nThere's a group of young ladies gathered at the table in the back, surrounding a certain young man.\nThat young man was Glenn Dudley, who played the hero Ralph in today's play. His tall figure and copper hair could easily be spotted even when surrounded by a group of young ladies.\nApparently, his successful debut at the play had piqued the interest of numerous young ladies.\nOh my, my, my… what's so great about that crude and vulgar man? I feel pity for these young ladies who are not suited to be Felix's partner.\nEven Eliane was inwardly making fun of the young ladies who were fawning over Glenn, she still paid attention to their conversation.\nThe ladies were full of praise for today's play, and in between, they were inquiring about Glenn. And one of those ladies asked Gleen shyly in the enraptured face.\n\"Lord Dudley, I heard that you are a disciple of the Seven Sages, the Barrier Magician, is that true?\"\n\"That's right!\"\nW-W-W-W-What did he say!?\nShe has never heard any of it.\nGlenn Dudley was a transfer student in the second year of high school, and his un-aristocratic behavior has made him stand out from the crowd. However, perhaps because of his friendly personality, he seems to have a certain amount of interaction with some of the students.\nIn Eliane's opinion, Glenn Dudley was a \"delinquent\" who does not belong at Serendia Academy.\nAnd yet, for some reason, he was mingling with some of the student council members. Furthermore, Felix has taken an interest in him.\nA disciple of Seven Sages!? From the rumor, Sir Barrier Magician is very popular and influential in noble circles. Becoming a Seven Sage means his status will be raised to a count rank and more importantly, he will become His Majesty King's counselor… and it's the highest authority a person could achieve. And will Glenn Dudley follow his step too, I wonder?\nIgnoring half the praises of the young ladies, she turned her attention to the conversation Glenn had with the others.\n\"You look so good in that suit, Lord Dudley.\"\n\"Ehehe, just for your information, my master had specially arranged this suit for me!\"\nIn fact, everyone could tell that the suit he wore was made by a first-class tailor. Even the slim jacket, which was trendy in terms of collar shape and silhouette, suited his long arms and legs very well.\nHis master, Louis Miller, was well-known for his fashion sense among ladies in noble circles. As a result, Glenn's formal wear was very sophisticated.\nIt's a shame his sticking-out copper hair hadn't been arranged neatly, but among these young men, Glenn Dudley had a presence that didn't lose to Felix's (though it's more because of his large figure and loud voice.)\nAnd one of these young ladies asked Glenn timidly.\n\"Have you decided who you're going to dance with, Lord Dudley?\"\n\"Hmm, I'm not that good at dancing. I guess I'll satisfy my stomach and eat many dishes for now.\"\n\"You're so funny, Lord Dudley.\"\nThe ladies seemed to be having fun, even after hearing Glenn's free-spirited response. This time, another lady asked jokingly.\n\"Could you tell us what type of girl do you like, Lord Dudley?\"\n\"Well, I'd love to hear about it!\"\n\"Please tell us!\"\nI'd like to hear it too. Eliane focused all her attention.\nGlenn folded his arms and pondered seriously, letting his gaze wander through the air then opened his mouth.\n\"…a girl like Amelia, I guess.\"\nAmelia, the wife of the Founder King Ralph—a role played by Eliane. His words were like saying that he adores Eliane who played Amelia.\nOh, my! if you had said that in front of me, I would have told you that I adore Felix more than Ralph!\nWhile Eliane has these nasty thoughts, Glenn continued with his words.\n\"Ever since I read the story of the Founder King as a child, I've always liked a collected woman like Amelia. She's cool, good at her job, and while she will tell you directly when you did something wrong, she will also listen to your problems seriously… and when you're hurt, she might say ‘well, it can't be helped,' but she'll take care of you in the end. Preferably older than me.\"\nEliane unconsciously gaped her mouth open.\nThat's unexpected. All the aspects he had provided were the exact opposite of Eliane's in every way. As information, Eliane was in her first year in the advanced course, so she was younger than Glenn.\nWhen Eliane hurriedly covered her almost retracted expression with a fan, the young men around her asked, \"are you not feeling well?\" But she quickly put on a lovely smile and looked up at them.\n\"I apologize for making all of you worried… It just, I felt so embarrassed to be praised so much,\" said Eliane with a smile, and everybody around her smitten over in delight.\nThis is how it should be. If anything, the one who didn't have a good eye was Glenn Dudley. Even when he had performed on the stage with a lovely lady like her, he haven't said hello to her, let alone complimented her.\nHow about giving her a greeting—and maybe with some praise. If so, she might praise him for having a good eye.\nAs if Eliane's thoughts had been transmitted over, Glenn turned his gaze and looked toward Eliane.\nAnd of course, Eliane had never intended to approach him. Even he approached her, she won't call him out first.\nWhile Eliane had these thoughts, Gleen approached her quickly with a large stride—but he briskly walked past her and called out to a small girl standing near the entrance.\n\"I knew it! It's you, Monica! Hey, Monica!\"\n\"…oh, Dudley… Good evening…\"\n\"Good evening! Your dress looks so lovely. It suits you perfectly!\"\n\"T-Thank… you… ehehe\"\nEliane unconsciously lifted down her fan, and the young men around her called out to her with concern, only to be ignored in vain.\nWhile anger emitted within her blue-gray pupils, Eliane stared quietly at Glenn Dudley and Monica.\nIf it had come to this, she could care less with her etiquette as a young lady anymore.\nSo she walked over toward Felix with a rapid pace, and after confirming his chat with the teachers was over, she called out to him.\n\"Lord Felix, would you like to have a dance with me?\"",

      "content": "Monica was talking to Glenn at the moment. During this time, she glimpsed some envy gazes from the people around her. Especially the young ladies who wanted to talk to Glenn.\nIt must be the effect of his performance in the play. Remembering the applause and the uproar at the end of the performance, Monica smiled wryly inwardly.\n\"By the way, I don't see Lana with you today.\"\n\"Well… We've arrived together up to the venue's entrance… but she said, ‘I may become a hindrance if I'm here, so…' then parted away with me…\"\n\"A hindrance…? Whom she's going to be a hindrance to, I wonder?\"\n\"I'm not sure…\"\nRemembering Lana's meaningful smile, Monica could only tilt her head in confusion.\nSince mulling over this question any further would not produce any result, Monica simply gave up thinking about it.\n\"Speaking of your dress, it looks very good on you.\"\n\"He-he, actually this dress was prepared by my master.\"\n\"Did Lou—Lord Barrier Magician really prepare it for you?\"\nMonica almost inadvertently said ‘Louis' but corrected herself immediately. And Glenn himself didn't know that Monica's true identity nor her relationship as Louis' colleague.\n…he's so devoted to his job…\nIn fact, the shoes she was wearing now were prepared by Louis Miller.\nBut when considering how he's been acted, witnessing how devoted he was to even preparing his pupil's formal dress and Monica's shoes, it made her feel discomfort.\n\"I've also asked this to my master, ‘can I really get such a fine dress?' But he only said, ‘it's provided.' I wonder what did he mean by provided. Does the Seven Sage's payment also cover his pupils' clothes as well?\"\n\"…a-ha-ha.\"\nMost likely, what he meant by ‘provided' was referring to the necessary expenses for the second prince's escort mission. Monica's entrance fee's also paid from there. Since Glenn was also sent to the Serendia Academy as a distraction to help Monica's enrollment, its expenses were treated as necessary. And any payments involving Glenn's needs were a necessary expense.\nWait, isn't this mission a direct order from His Majesty…\nDidn't that mean Louis Miller impose the king for the cost of his apprentice's formal dress? Then, if these shoes were like that too… Monica who's realized it's too late paled instantly.\nJudging how forward Louis Miller's personality was, he sure will claim all of these expenses were necessary, even if the other party he's dealing with was the king.\nI think… I have accepted something outrageous…\nWhile Monica inadvertently squirmed her feet, Glenn looked behind her then exclaimed. Lured by his sudden voice, Monica also followed his gaze. Then she saw Cyril Ashley in his formal dress, walking quickly toward them as he looking for something. The expression on his face seemed to be in a bit of a hurry. Did some trouble happen?\n\"What's up, Vice President. Got some trouble?\"\n\"Hmm? So it's you two, Glenn Dudley and Treasurer Norton… As you can see, I can't find the conductor of the orchestra, have you seen him around here?\"\nNow that he mentioned it, it's about the time for the ball's dance to start.\nFrom Cyril's story, the conductor had gone to the washroom but seemed to lost his way here, so they couldn't perform the orchestra.\nKneading her fingers, Monica asked Cyril.\n\"U-Um… do you know what that person looks like?\"\n\"He is about the same height as me. He is over fifty and a little overweight. Gray hair with curls at the ends. He wore a black formal dress.\"\n\"U-Um, do you know how the size of his legs and arms, maybe if you know the exact size of some parts of his face, I could increase my accuracy…\"\n\"How can I know that!? Wait, what do you mean by ‘accuracy,' hey.\"\nWithout answering Cyril's question, Monica cast a farsight spell without chanting. This spell allowed her to see far into the distance… yet because of her short height, her vision was obstructed by people's figures, making it difficult to see far away.\n\"Mmm…\"\nLooking at Monica who was doing a tiptoe, Glenn, as he had realized something, put his hands under Monica's armpits and lifted her small body.\n\"What are you doing!?\"\n\"If I do this, she can see farther! Monica, did you find the conductor?\"\nTo be carried up by Glenn like this was a little—no, it was really embarrassing. Even so, it allowed her to see around farther.\nMonica can accurately determine a person's height and the length of their limbs just by looking at them.\nThere might be some distance, but it's possible to accurately calculate a person's size by estimating the height Glenn had lifted her, the distance between them, and its angle.\nWhile being lifted up by Glenn, Monica looked around in a circle, then opened her mouth while keeping her gaze fixed on someone.\n\"…I found three men who fit the description. The first person has his hair tied back. The second person has an aquiline nose. The third person has a lady next to him… The second person's arms are slightly different in length on each side, so I think he might have been playing some kind of instrument…\"\n\"Does the aquiline-nosed man wear a pin on his lapel? He should've been wearing one If he's a member of the orchestra.\"\nA normal person would be unable to see him from this distance, but Monica, who was using a farsight spell could see it clearly. After adjusting her spell to focus on his lapel, she saw a violin-like pin attached to it.\nAfter she told Cyril what she saw, he said, ‘it's him,' and nodded in confirmation.\n\"Thanks, but can I ask you to guide me to this person's position?\"\n\"S-Sure.\"\nAfter thanking Glenn for lifting her up, Monica guided Cyril to the conductor's position.\nConsidering how far their distance to the conductor, Cyril inadvertently blurted out, \"are you really can see him at this distance?\" in a mutter. But since she can't honestly say that she's using a farsight spell, she only gave him a vague smile and gave an excuse.\n\"Y-You see, I actually had good eyesight…\"\nAnd it was a total lie. While Monica mostly spent her time writing in a dark place, she actually had reasonably good eyesight. But it's unlikely for her sight to reach the end of the venue.\nOnce Monica and Cyril arrived at the conductor's position, they led him to the where orchestra band was.\nAfter Cyril sure the orchestra started without a hitch, he patted his chest in relief.\n\"…Thank you, you've been a big help this time, really. To tell the truth, we've arranged this orchestra bigger than usual… though, many unexpected problems occurred afterward.\"\n\"It's fine… but, wasn't it Lord Maywood's job to handle the orchestra matters?\"\nSince virtually, all the matters related to the backstage of the ball were handled by Neil.\nCome to think of it, Cyril seemed to be helping Neil from the preparation stage, could it be that there was some kind of trouble without Monica's awareness?\n\"U-Um, did some trouble happen in Lord Maywood's side? S-Should I provide him with some help…\"\n\"Oh, it's not like that.\"\nCyril shook his head slowly and awkwardly darted his gaze around.\n\"Well… I want to give General Affairs Manager Maywood some free time, so I offered myself to take over his duties.\"\n\"…???\"\nAs Monica tilted her head in puzzlement, a student who was in charge as a receptionist approached Cyril rapidly then whispered some words to his ear. Cyril's furrowed his thin brows and responded, \"Alright, I'll be there right away.\"\nCyril then looked at Monica's face and the flower ornament on her chest alternately, and for some reason, he looked depressed.\n\"…Treasurer Norton, can I ask you a favor?\"\n\"S-Sure, what would it be?\"\n\"I just received a report that a problem appears at the receptionist desk. They don't have enough kitchen liaisons and it had to be dealt with immediately. So could I ask you to handle that role until a replacement student arrives?\"\nIn most cases, the job of the kitchen liaison is to pass orders between the venue and the kitchen. While technically the waiter and the chef would communicate directly with each other, a liaison would be required to assist in preparing the necessary supplies and helping to alleviate the situation when both of them had too busy dealing with their orders.\nUp until now, Cyril had never assigned Monica with this kind of task. Considering how weak her physical was, he always assigned her a behind-the-desk chore involving numbers.\nAnd that's why Cyril felt anxious about it. And Monica also felt that way. If it was her usual self she would say, ‘I-I can't!' while shaking her head.\nBut right now, I had this charm with me…\nMonica looked at the white rose ornament—the charm Cyril had given to her to prevent her from embarrassment—which had been arranged on her chest. After burning that image into her mind, she lifted her face up.\n\"…I-I will do it.\"\nCyril looked at her wryly. He's probably had a mixed feeling when hearing Monica's answer. Since Monica's fear of strangers had seeped deep into her bone, he must be worried to leave this task to her.\n\"…If nothing happens, you will only need to standby there. But, if some troubles occurred, contact me immediately.\"\n\"O-Okay!\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"Lord Felix, would you like to have a dance with me?\" called out Eliane, and Felix responded with a gentle smile as he stretched out his hand.\n\"I would be happy to.\"\nRight after that exchange, the music started.\nSmiling sweetly at her, Felix invited her into the dance hall.\nAll eyes were immediately drawn to them when they took each other's hand and started to dance. The sight of the handsome prince and beautiful duke's daughter was dancing together had enthralled everybody in the hall.\nAs the two figures performed their perfect dance moves, their gazes swept over their surroundings for a brief moment before they shifted directions.\nEliane was looking for Glenn's figure and found him munching on some meat at the light meal table. Of course, he didn't pay attention to the dance hall.\nAs for Felix, he was looking for Monica's figure. He caught the sight of her talking some matter with Cyril. And of course, she also didn't pay attention to the dance hall.\nOh my, oh my, oh my… you sure have some nerve to be more interested in eating than looking in my direction? Look at me and be envious, Glenn Dudley! In fact, you should have been sucking your thumb while seeing my graceful dance with Lord Felix, and don't just keep eating those meats!\n(Eliane)\nMonica didn't seem to understand the meaning of the flower ornament… well, I know Cyril gave her that flower ornament under the pretense of a \"charm\" without telling her its meaning was to keep her away from the other men but isn't a bit unfair to have a dance with Monica for yourself?\n(Felix)\nHey, look at my dance with Lord Felix. Why not you look in my direction and put that attention of yours here?\n{Eliane)\nI'm sure she couldn't care less about me dancing with someone, though I knew that. But, aren't we buddies who spent one night together not long ago? I wish you could be more concerned about it.\n(Felix)\nOnce again, Felix and Eliane looked at each other, giving impeccable and perfect smiles.\n\"It's like having my dream come true to be able to dance with you like this, Your Highness.\"\n\"It would be my honor.\"\nThey might be showing their beautiful smile at each other, but their minds were, in fact, in another place.",

      "content": "Claudia Ashley was leaning back on the sofa and letting her gloomy air spread around her. The gloominess was so overwhelming that if she said that there had been misfortune in her family today, people might inadvertently believe her.\nHowever, no matter how much gloom she spreads, her perfect beauty remained intact. Especially in the eyes of men who were blinded by love, her gloomy appearance seems to be languid and fleeting.\n\"Miss Claudia, would you please accept my rose?\"\nThe man who knelt in front of Claudia and offered her a rose ornament was the ninth who tried his luck today.\nClaudia let out a sigh behind her fan.\n\"…It's almost double digits.\"\n\"Yes?\"\nIt was the number of flowers she had thrown into the trash bin.\nClaudia lifted herself up slowly from leaning on the armrest and stared at the red rose that was offered to her.\n\"……I do like flowers.\"\n\"This rose is a new variant with a strong fragrance we've cultivated in our home. And I've chosen this flower just for you…\"\n\"…It sure has a good fragrance.\"\nA thin smile plastered on her doll-like face. When the people of her surrounding saw it, they were mesmerized and exhaled in adoration, that's how beautiful she was.\nAnd such a beautiful young lady with her smile still exposed on her face told the man who offered her the flower.\n\"…but, I have no desire to wear such strong fragrance flower…\"\nThe man's face tensed up. The people who were listening to this exchange couldn't stand it any longer and started chuckling.\nSuch exchange normally would have broken most people's hearts, but the ninth challenger was quite persistent.\n\"Our family, Marquis Gringham, has a close relationship with Marquis Highon…\"\n\"…That was three generations ago.\"\n\"I've been hoping to have a long chat with Miss Claudia for some time now.\"\n\"…If you want a connection to the Marquis of Highon, you should probably go talk to my brother.\"\n\"No, what I'm interested in is you, Miss Claudia. I've never seen a woman as beautiful as you.\"\nWhen the man looked at Claudia with passionate eyes, Claudia narrowed her lapis lazuli eyes and covered her mouth with a fan.\n\"…well, it's amazing how a man with limited knowledge can say that every time he meets a new woman.\"\nIn this lively venue, only the area around the sofa where Claudia was sitting was enveloped in a chilly atmosphere.\nAs the man fell silent, a modest voice called out from behind him, \"Um, excuse me…\"\nThe man turned around to see a small boy in formal attire, Neil Clay Maywood, standing there looking rather awkward.\nClaudia looked at Neil impassively.\n\"…did something, happen?\"\n\"N-No, I just… well…\"\nNeil gave a lame cough and held out his right hand, which had been hidden behind his back, in front of Claudia.\nIn his hand was a flower ornament of orange roses with a brown ribbon.\nClaudia widened her eyes and Neil scratched his cheek in embarrassment.\n\"Would you like to dance with me?\"\nIt took Claudia a few seconds to swallow the meaning of Neil's words. It wasn't that she was trying to ridicule him. The words really got stuck in her throat and didn't come out right away.\n\"…that rose was supposed to be given ahead as a token of someone has been taken, not right before the dance.\"\nInstead of ‘I'm so happy, I'm so delighted,' the words that came out from her mouth were far from such cute words.\nBut Neil didn't seem bothered, in fact, he lowered his eyebrows apologetically.\n\"I-I'm sorry. I thought it would be rude to you when I was not sure if I'll have time to dance to give you that kind of token…\"\nNeil said exactly what Cyril had expected him to say.\nClaudia's widened eyes narrowed then put a soft smile on her face.\n\"…can you put that flower ornament on me?\"\n\"Yes!\"\nNeil stood in front of the seated Claudia and bent down to fasten the flower ornament on the chest of her royal blue dress. He was very careful not to touch Claudia's body, which was typical of a sincere man.\nWhen he finished fastening the roses, Neil lowered his eyebrows in a troubled manner.\n\"I should have used white roses to match today's blue dress. I'm sorry… for choosing my favorite color.\"\n\"…but I like it.\"\nEven at a time like this, he was more concerned about what would look good on Claudia than dying it to his own colors…\nI wish you could have dyed me in your colors more.\nClaudia wants Neil to fixate on the fact that she belongs to him. She wants to show it to everyone around her. So Claudia would proudly show off the rose, the proof of reservation, to the people around her that—\n—I belong to Neil.\nClaudia held out her hand, and Neil took it in a very natural motion.\nStanding side by side, Claudia was somewhat taller than him. Claudia has chosen to wear low-heeled shoes, but the height difference was still obvious to everyone.\n\"…I thought you didn't want to dance with a taller woman.\"\n\"What? S-Sorry if I'm too small for you, Miss Claudia, but it's hard for you to dance, isn't it? Please let me know if it's getting burdensome, okay?\"\nSee, even at a time like this, Neil can't help but care about Claudia.\nWhat a hateful, adorable, and lovable person.\n\"…I could dance all day long, you know?\"\n\"Ah, but I don't think it would possible.\"\nShe stared at Neil with a bit of bitterness as he answered immediately, and he said with a wry smile.\n\"Vice President Ashley had volunteered himself to take over my job. I've been meeting with him since this morning for that purpose… Ah, he told me not to tell this to you… I-I'm sorry, could you keep this secret from him…?\"\n\"………\"\nClaudia then scanned her eyes around to find Cyril's figure, but he's not there.\nHe's probably running around behind the scenes to take over Neil's job. It's just like that of a stepbrother who put himself on the back burner.\nIn spite of your blockheaded head, you still put a concern in a weird way… It made me hate myself.\nWith this, she had to pay that debt someday. Preferably, she would repay it in a way that her step-brother would be grateful in a reluctant face.\n* * *\nMonica, who had been entrusted with the role of liaison between the kitchen and the serving staff, opened the kitchen door, her face tense with tension.\nThe atmosphere in the kitchen was even more intense than at a party, with chefs working busily.\nS-Should I greet them? What will they think if they saw a girl in a dress comes suddenly? Maybe if I introduce myself, they will understand… but, they looked so busy…\nAlthough she had the courage to open the door, it was difficult to take a step forward from there. In addition, talking to the busy people working there was an extremely high barrier for a shy person like her.\nI'm going to say it, I will say it, but it has to be at the right timing… wait, when is the right timing? As Monica was pondering over this, a cook with a big figure looked at her and shouted.\n\"What's the matter, little girl? Are you lost?\"\n\"N-Noooo… W-Well… S-Student Council… has appointed me to be a liaison here…\" said Monica in a faint voice, and the cook's face lit up.\n\"Oh! You've got the right timing! The weather is quite good, right?\"\n\"Y-Yeah…\"\n\"Because of that, the ices we used to cool the ice cream was melted. So I need you to get the vice president to make some ice for me.\"\nCyril might have said that she only just have to standby there if nothing happened, but perhaps, it's only her wishful thinking that it will end without anything happening.\nThe cook held out a large basin to Monica. Its size was big enough for two grown men to hold hands and form a circle.\n\"We need it this much. I count this on you.\"\nSo he asked her.\nAfter holding out her hands to the limits to receive the basin, she walked over to the hallway.\nSince the ices they asked for are magically made, it means that they only need it for cooling purposes, not to consume… I guess.\nIce made by magic contains mana which is not suitable to consume. If it's consumed excessively, especially by people who're not resistant to mana, it can cause mana poisoning.\nBut, if it's only to be used for cooling ice creams from the outside, even using magically made ices, it would pose no problem.\nThe cook was probably planning to rely on Cyril, who was good at ice spell, but Cyril was busy. If possible, she doesn't want to bother him with another trouble.\nHolding a basin in her hands, Monica exhaled through her nose and moved to the end corridor where fewer people were around.\nThen, with no chanting magic, she created a full tray of ices. By eliminating impurities and increasing the quantity of mana, she was able to produce beautiful clear ices which were harder to melt.\n…It's done!\nAfter nodding in satisfaction, Monica tried to lift the basin, but…\n\"Uggghhhhh!!\"\nshe just realized the basin was too heavy to lift.\nShe just made a careless mistake that would make people doubt her title of genius.\nMonica struggled for a while but eventually gave up trying to lift the basin, so she crouched down and pushed it with both hands.\nLooking at Monica crouched down in her dress to push the basin, some young ladies passed by snickered.\n\"Oh my, what a sight.\"\n\"She's just like cattle.\"\n\"How disgraceful.\"\n\"I don't think the guests would like to see that sight.\" said the young ladies mockingly, but those words didn't pass through to the struggling Monica.\nJust a little bit, just for a little bit… so said Monica told herself as she pushed the basin, eventually, she saw the kitchen's door.\nIn her ragged breaths, she kept pushing the basin, but… sudden dizziness came struck instantly.\n…ah.\nAfter fighting the intruder and being poisoned, her body had not yet recovered to the point where she could do some physical task.\nHer head throbbed in pain and her vision went whirling.\nI can't… I can't collapse here… I still haven't done…\nMonica's fingers which held the basin slipped off and her small body lost its strength before she collapsed to the floor. As her skin paled, her consciousness washed away.\nI still… haven't… done… my task…",

      "content": "Monica felt like someone had rubbed her head. And the memory of her dad rubbed her head when a little surfaced. But the current hand who rubbed her head was more tender than her dad.\nFrom afar, she could hear faint music sounds. It's waltz music played by the orchestra.\n\"………\"\nSlowly opening her eyes, her hazy vision was greeted by the sight of a pair of platinum blonde eyes whose beauty could rival some jewels.\n\"Are you okay?\"\n\"…Lord… Cyril…\"\nAfter hearing a faint response from Monica, Cyril whose focuses were on her let out a sigh of relief. But then Monira realized, she was lying down on the couch, and she was using Cyril's leg who's sitting there, as a pillow.\nIn a panic, Monica tried to get up from that position. But her attempt had caused the thin blanket which draped over her body to drop to the floor.\nLooking at her surrounding, the place she was at is not the ballroom. But a preparation and resting room used for the student council. Considering how she still heard some waltz from inside, the room must not be far from the ballroom.\n\"U-Um… I…\"\n\"I heard from the cook, you were collapsed in front of the kitchen. He was in a panic when he told me that.\"\n\"!\"\nOpening and closing her mouth, Monica covered her drained face with both hands.\nMonica thought she could still move, she would be fine, but it seems that her body was much weaker than she thought. In the first place, the drug that the assassin had given her had not yet worn off. And yet, she had overestimated herself, thinking that she was still fine, but only caused trouble in the end.\n\"I-I'm sorry… to have to trouble you…\"\nShe had intended to manage it on her own, but the end result was this mess. The reason for her failure was obvious. She was overconfident in her physical strength. And… her reluctance to ask someone to carry it for her. For the shy Monica, asking someone's help her is very uncomfortable. So, she avoided it and tried to manage on her own… and failed.\nMy help only causes trouble to people.\nA drop of water dripped down and wet the petals of the flower ornament on her chest. Hanging down her head, Monica was holding her tears, then she heard Cyril letting out a sigh. Ah, he must be fed up with her.\n\"…are you not feeling well?\"\n\"………\"\nUnable to affirm nor to retort, Monica kept sniffling. Cyril took a handkerchief out of his pocket and put it over Monica's eyes.\n\"About the ices… the kitchen staffs were grateful for the help.\"\nMonica lifted up her face, looked toward Cyril. His face looked more troubled rather than angry.\n\"I knew that you were not suited to be a negotiator or a liaison. But I appreciated the fact that you offered yourself to help.\"\n\"…eh?\"\n\"This time, it happened due to your insufficient physical condition, but at least you did the job that needed to be done. You can be proud of that.\"\nWhen Monica blinked her tear-stained eyelashes up and down, Cyril looked away and coughed.\n\"Of course, you can't keep being like that forever, so you'll have to learn to negotiate at some point! Next time you're not feeling well, report it as soon as possible! When you need help, ask around!\"\n\"Y-Yes!\"\n\"His Highness has nominated General Affairs Manager Maywood to be the student council president for next year. If General Affairs Manager Maywood becomes president, I'm sure you will be nominated as a member again, since you have some experience before.\"\nNeil and Monica are the only second-year students on the current student council. The rest are all third-year students. If Felix and the others were to graduate and Neil was to become president, it would be fitting to elect Monica, who had experience in student council, on the board.\n\"When General Affairs Manager Maywood becomes the president, you will be his right-hand man. Therefore, you need to overcome your weakness in interpersonal relations. Keep that in mind and continue to devote yourself…\"\nThe way Cyril spoke to Monica was like he was certain that Monica will be there in the next year.\n—But, there's no next year for Monica.\nHer reason came to this academy was to guard Felix. So, she had no reason to remain here when Felix graduated. After that, she would leave the academy—and return back living as one of the Seven Sages, Monica Everett of Silent Witch.\nThat's why I want to be helpful in this year's ball.\nCyril became awkward after looking at Monica's face became dejected.\n\"For now… let's put aside our duties as student council.\"\n\"…?\"\nLooking up at Cyril curiously, she saw he was mumbling while looking at the flower ornament on her chest.\n\"You were looking forward to dancing, no? I'm sorry for making you help with my work.\"\n\"Eh?\"\nMonica was flabbergasted by the unexpected words. Had she ever said that she was looking forward to the dance?\nU-Um… yesterday… at student council room…\nNow that he mentioned it, she felt she might have said that.\nYesterday, while Monica was wandering around looking for her magical tool brooch, she said she was looking forward to dancing to deceive him and did a dance practice afterward.\nD-Don't tell me, he was worried about that…!?\nMonica felt a cold sweat break out in apology. She didn't plan to participate in dancing in the first place. Instead, she wanted to help others as the student council treasurer, Monica Norton… though it ended up in a failure.\n\"Um, I think, I'm fine with dancing… I mean, I'm not very good at dancing, so it'll only embarrass my partner.\"\nSomehow, when she gave a wry smile, Cyril seemed to be sullen. Why is he so sullen? As Monica was wondering, Cyril, got up from the couch and kneeled in front of Monica.\n\"No one would see us in here, so we wouldn't be embarrassed.\"\n\"…ah.\"\nCyril took Monica's hand and lifted his long eyelashes to look up at her. Monica could see her petrified face in his vibrant blue eyes.\n\"Would you like to have a dance with me, my lady?\"\nCaught in his strong gaze, Monica nodded her head faster than she could think.\nCyril led Monica along as the orchestra played in the distance. She hadn't danced with Cyril like this since she had practiced ballroom dancing with him.\nCyril, who was also a good lead, naturally led Monica, who was not very good. As she spun around, her young grass-colored skirt spread softly. After the turn, Monica's body wobbled, but Cyril supported her and she started to step again. Despite being bad at physical exercise, she honestly thought it was fun.\nEventually, sooner than the song ended, Cyril stopped and finished the dance. Monica thought he was doing it out of consideration for her health, but Cyril raised his thin eyebrows and stared at her.\n\"…how can your dance be worse than before?\"\nHe had a grim face of the usual Cyril Ashley, a far cry from his noble demeanor during the dance.\nAh, it's the usual Lord Cyril… with a strange sense of relief, Monica kneaded her fingers and made an excuse.\n\"I-I'm sorry, I can dance a little better if I think about the equations and empty my head…\"\nIn fact, she even passed her ballroom dancing exam that way. In Monica's case, it was much easier to dance by just thinking about the formula and letting the lead do the work, rather than thinking about all the other things in her head. And yet, Monica did not do so.\n\"If I fill my head with numbers… I think It would be a shame.\"\nFor Monica, the world of numbers is the most beautiful thing. Monica doesn't know what could be more engrossing than mathematical and magical formulas.\nEven then, just for now—more than mathematical, more than magic formula—she wanted to remember the time she spent as Monica Norton. For some reason, when Cyril heard Monica say those words calmly, he held his breath before darting his gaze around.\n\"…You should train harder, so you will be able to dance better by the next year's ball\"\nHearing Cyril's blunt words, Monica smiled vaguely. The feelings that come up were just like chocolate, it was sweet yet bitter at the same time… with a slight longing within it.\nI'm sorry, Lord Cyril… After all, I'll not be in the academy anymore by the next year.\nThat's why, Monica desires memories—a kind that sparkles and shines like a drawer full of treasures—more than mathematical, more than magic formulas.",

      "content": "Cyril sat Monica down on the couch and picked up a blanket that had fallen to the floor to drape it over her shoulders.\n\"I'll be heading back to my work soon… but until you're feeling better, you should stay here and rest.\"\n\"I-I will… and, um… thank you for everything.\"\nMonica was trying to be helpful, but instead, she was being helped. And when she thought that Cyril had taken care of all this for Monica, her heart was filled with a sense of guilt. But Cyril, as he typically did, lifted his chin haughtily and snorted.\n\"As His Highness' right-hand man, this is nothing much of a problem for me. Soon, General Affairs Manager Maywood will be back.\"\nThus, the sight of his chest outstretched and his chin lifted sharply, made her think, \"Ah, it's the usual Lord Cyril,\" and strangely reassured Monica even more.\nWhen she first met him, she felt intimidated by Cyril's haughty behavior, but lately, looking at his proud manner only makes her feel strangely at ease instead.\n\"Lord Cyril, um…\"\n\"What is it?\"\nMonica pinched the ribbon that hung from the flower ornament on her chest and bit her lip tightly. She really wanted to thank Cyril before he went back to continue his job.\n\"…Thank you very much for giving me this charm… Thanks to it, I was able to work harder than usual today.\"\nThe always cold eyes of Cyril softened slightly. A small smile crept onto the edges of his lips.\n\"I see…\"\nMurmuring as if chewing on something, Cyril walked out of the room.\nAs she listened to the sound of the door quietly closing, Monica tightly squeezed the blanket over her shoulders. Her dizziness had subsided considerably, but it would be better to rest a little while longer since she had just collapsed not long ago.\nFor no particular reason, Monica looked out the window and let out a sigh of admiration at the stars twinkling in the night sky.\nProbably by now, Lady Star Oracle Witch was looking up at the night sky and predicting the future of this country.\nCome to think of it, I wonder what Lady Star Oracle Witch was referring to when she said,\n\"I've been foreseen many futures of the kingdom, especially on the royal family… but for the past ten years, I've been unable to read His Highness Felix's destiny.\"\nStar Oracle Witch was unable to foresee Felix's destiny. For some time now, there has been a series of major incidents around Felix. An assassination attempt by Casey, an intruder at a chess tournament, and today, an assassin named Yuan has reappeared. Every single one of them was a major incident. And yet, the Star Oracle WItch was unable to foresee any of these incidents.\nI am also curious about what that Yuan guy said… if his goal was not to assassinate His Highness… then why did he intrude into the school?\nWhat Yuan said was:\n\"Yeah, I've confirmed it at a close range after pretending to be getting rid of a spider from him. It's the work of the traitor Arthur…\nThat\nperson's prediction was right\"\nAt close range, what did Yuan confirm from Felix? Who is the traitor Artur? Who is \"that person\" that Yuan talking about? The more she pondered, the more questions came flooding in. Leaning against the window sill, Monica gazed blankly at the twinkling stars.\nSomewhere on that star, is there a destiny for Felix?\n\"…huh?\"\nMonica might unable to foresee Felix's destiny in the night sky… but she couldn't help but peel her eyes away when she spotted him by the tree just below her.\n\"W-Why would His Highness be in a place like that…\"\nAs Monica's mouth opened and closed repeatedly, Felix looked around—and then, unexpectedly, he started to climb the tree in his formal wear.\n\"Whaaaat!?\"\nWhat is the star of this party planning to even have sneaking out of the party at this time? Whatever it was, it was something that Monica, as his secret guard, could not overlook. So Monica rushed out of the room and headed to Felix's place.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nMonica remembered the shape of the tree Felix had climbed, so when she walked out of the hall, she was able to find it right away. Upon closer inspection, she could see the honey blondes glowing in the moonlight through the leaves.\n\"Y-Your Highness…\"\nMonica looked up at the tree and called out to him, and the leaves rustled and swayed.\n\"You are still very good at finding ‘me', aren't you?\"\nFelix looked down at Monica from the top of the tree and chuckled, then he lightly jumped down from the tree and landed in front of her.\nMonica was anxious, wondering if it was safe for him to jump down from such a high place, but Felix looked nonchalant and picked the leaves from his hair with his fingertips.\n\"U-Um… what about the party…\"\n\"I just wanted to get some fresh air.\"\n\"If you want to get some fresh air, why would you need to climb a tree?\"\nMonica asked fearfully, but Felix laughed in a mischievous way—it's the laugh he showed when he was in the entertainment district.\n\"I just want to see some stars, because it's looked beautiful today.\"\n\"… are you fond of the stars?\"\n\"Not really.\"\nFelix denied it easily and looked up at the stars above him squinting.\n\"I wasn't that interested in it at the beginning, but my friend was very knowledgeable about it, you see. So, the more he told me about it, the more I became familiar with it. Maybe that's why I feel like going outside when I see the stars.\"\nFelix took Monica's hand in a very natural gesture and put his other hand on her waist. It was as if they were about to start dancing.\n\"Um, Your Highness, I think you should back to the ball…\"\n\"Just hang out with me for a while. I mean, you sure would refuse my invitation if we're in the hall.\"\nHe's right, so Monica decided to be quiet and let Felix take the lead.\nRather than dancing, it was more like just strolling along to the music. Even though Monica's steps were messed up and she didn't get her turn, Felix didn't seem to mind, in fact, he seemed to be enjoying it.\n\"It reminds me of the time I taught you to dance. At that time, you were thinking about embroidering in my scarf, weren't you?\"\n\"Uh…um…well, it's about a theorem applying the scarf pattern, to be exact…\"\n\"Then, I suppose you don't remember anything I said to you back then, do you?\"\nOnce again, he was right on the spot, so Monica kept her silent. Felix chuckled meanly and brought his lips to Monica's ear.\n\"You look pretty good in that dress. It's dainty, yet subtly gorgeous, and it seems to bring out your charm. I knew a green dress would suit you very well. Right, dark green color like a forest can be wonderful, but the color of young leaves in spring looks lovely too.\"\n\"Well, uh, thank you.\"\nBeing complimented on the dress made her feel embarrassed, but she was also honestly happy. It was like he was praising Lana who'd prepared this dress for her.\n\"Your hair is pretty, too. Did your friend do that flowery hairdo for you?\"\n\"Yes, Lana and I have matching hairstyles.\"\nLooking at Monica smiled bashfully, Felix lifted the edge of his lips slightly, formed a dispirited smile.\n\"…how envious.\"\n\"…eh?\"\nThe hand that held Monica's waist strengthened. The music was still going on, but the steps stopped. Felix's blue, gleaming eyes looked somewhat inorganically at the flower ornament on Monica's chest. He then reached out his hand to Monica's neck, traced a line down Monica's neck with his fingertips, while keeping his other hand on her waist.\n\"…I gave you that peridot necklace, but you never wore it.\"\nMonica's body jumped involuntarily at the low voice that shivered in her ears. Now Monica realized why Felix had been so concerned about her neck during the day. His voice sounded somewhat sulky, just like he did that night.\n\"…Eig\"\n\"Hmm.\"\n\"I'm not yet skilled in fashion, so…\"\n\"Nevertheless, I wanted to see you wearing that necklace.\"\nFelix's words were as if he were jealous of Lana who gave her a floral hairdo and Cyril who gave a floral ornament. And she thought it was impossible. Confusion filled Monica's eyes, and strangely, the stare that Felix gave to Monica filled with passion.\n\"The brilliance of a jewel and the brilliance of a star are very similar. If the peridot had been shining around your neck, I would have admired you more than the shooting stars in the night sky.\"\nAs the sweet, well-groomed face stared at her at close range, Monica's eyes whirled around as she struggled to think and squeeze out the words.\n\"W-W-Wha…\"\n\"What is it?\"\n\"What made a shooting star can shine so beautifully is because they're moving unbelievably fast for it to travel from one country to another within one second, even it only has the size of a small pebble. Objects moving at high speed would emit light when they collide with the tiny atoms and molecules in the night sky, which is much different from the principle of shining jewels. In the first place, jewels do not emit light from within themselves, unless they have magical power added to them, but rather by reflecting light…\"\nFelix put his hand over his mouth and shuddered. His throat quivered, before letting out a breathy laugh. Although he didn't understand exactly what was being said, the words she said to him has really tickled him.\n\"I see you are familiar not only with numbers but also with stars.\"\n\"Well…\"\nMonica doesn't specialize in astronomy, but she has been calculating the orbits of stars at the request of the Star Oracle Witch. So, she had a good amount of basic knowledge about astronomy.\n\"…If you delved deeper in Biology subject, you will find many aspects in it only composed of a minuscule number which accumulated to add up with each other. While Astronomy is all about calculating huge numbers which much bigger than the national budget… Well, they're both very interesting, mathematically speaking.\"\n\"Do you want to be a scholar in the future?\"\n\"I wonder…\" trailed off Monica at Felix's question and smiled vaguely.\nMonica has never dreamed of being anything else in her life. Not knowing what she wanted to be while frightened by people, she lived her life in a state of flux… until she realized she had become the Seven Sages.\nAfter becoming one of the Seven Sages, she had been slaying dragons and doing calculations that other Seven Sages had asked her to do, but her main focus was still on researching magic formulas. In that sense, Monica can already be said to be a researcher of magic. And probably the best in the country.\nBut she kept quiet, not telling Felix about it, to which he responded in a sincere manner.\n\"If you have a particular path you wish to pursue, I can talk to Count Kerbeck for you.\"\nMonica's eyes widened at Felix's suggestion and she shook her head in panic.\n\"N-No, I-I'm fine.\"\n\"Do you know what happens to girls who graduate from Serendia Academy?\"\n\"…?\"\nTo the puzzled Monica, Felix told her.\n\"They will be married to.\"\nThe students of Serendia Academy were all children of noble families, so it was quite natural for them to be married. Moreover, they can't choose who they want to marry.\n\"Have you ever thought about marrying someone?\"\nMonica responded immediately to Felix's question.\n\"No.\"\nThat much was for certain and she denied it definitively.\nFor a witch who doesn't know love nor romance—moreover a one who is always frightened of people—will she have a future where she can build a warm family?\nMaybe, after she leaves Serendia Academy, she will return to the days of hiding in a mountain cabin where she lives only facing numbers and magic formulas while holding these memories in Serendia Academy like treasures.\nAs Monica looked down with vacant eyes, Felix took Monica's hand gently. Lifting up her face to face Felix, she blinked when saw Felix looking at her with a warm gaze.\nWhich smile is he showing now? Is it His Highness' or Eig's? But, without answering Monica's puzzling face, he told her.\n\"A long ago, my friend had told me some words, ‘\nI wish you could find many things you would be obsessed with that you like, you enjoy, not for anyone else, but for yourself.'\"\nHe had said those words when they walked through the entertainment district before. For that reason, he's looking for something he can enjoy, something he can be passionate about.\n\"Perhaps I don't have much freedom left. I hope you can carry on this wish.\"\nMonica felt a kind of resignation at those words, and thought, the person standing before her must be Eig.\n\"Then…what about you, Eig?\"\nHe is going to give up his friend's words that he has been holding in his heart for a long time, leaving all the wishes in those words to Monica. The moment she realized that, for the first time, Monica felt a kind of insecurity about this young man in front of her.\n\"D-Didn't the friend of yours tell you to find something you like to do? A-Are you going to… stop looking for it?\"\nWhen Monica spoke awkwardly, Felix lowered his eyebrows and smiled somewhat sadly.\n\"… I have a wish that I must fulfill, even if I have to break my friend's promise.\"\nWith that, Felix turned his gaze away from Monica and looked up at the night sky.\n\"Do you see the two large stars over there that connected in a trapezoidal shape? It's a constellation of the Hero Ralph. It said when he was on the verge of dying, he was afraid that people will forget about him… so his wife, Amelia, asked the Spirit King of Darkness, Eldiora, to create a constellation for the dying Ralph. So when people gazing upon the starry sky and saw those stars, they would immediately think about him.\"\nWhy are we suddenly talking about mythology? She thought Felix was changing the topic to avoid answering her question, but Monica's intuition whispered that it was not the case.\nAnd Monica probably has touched something around his true feelings which probably caused the young man before her to speak like that.\nLooking up at the hero's star, Felix's eyes were somewhat tranquil—as if he were dreaming.\n\"…even in his death, the Hero Ralph still leaves something to us in the brilliant night… and wouldn't it be wonderful if we can leave something like that as well?\"\nMonica's hair stood on end.\nFelix was always smiling calmly and gently. When he called himself Eig, he seemed easygoing and rarely showed any attachment to anything. Even when he was called a puppet of Duke Crockford, he still behaved like an exemplary prince. But in the eyes of the young man who was now looking up at the stars in front of her, there was a definite flame of obsession. And she felt a firm belief and madness deep-rooted within.\nBut when Felix turned back his gaze from the starry stars to Monica, he had the usual smile which was warm and gentle.\n\"I think it's getting cold here. Shall we go back inside?\"\nAll the sweet voices and gentle smiles showed outside only to mask his true feeling inside. Perhaps, even she pressed the matter more, it wouldn't touch his true feeling anymore. After nodding with her pale face, Monica followed behind the walking Felix.",

      "content": "Chapter es8: Extra Story 8: A Letter from My Mother\n[To my dearest motherThe weather here was so frigid in recent days and most parts of our dormitory have been covered in ice. Because of it, His Highness' clothes are getting thicker and I was spending my days practicing to control my magic so that he won't feel cold because of me.This year, I was able to choose Advanced Practical Magic as my elective course. For your information, Advanced Practical Magic can only be taken by those who have achieved excellent grades in the two subjects of Basic Magic and Practical Magic. However, I am very honored to have been recommended by my teacher and able to take the course successfully. I will devote myself day by day to eventually become a person who will not embarrass Marquis Highon as his successor.Speaking of which, the Serendia School Festival season is approaching. I'm aware you're so busy, but I wish you could visit by. Marquis Highon also said that he would provide us with a carriage. Since this will be my last school festival. I will try my best to help His Highness, the student council president, in his wonderful leadership, in the hope you can enjoy the school festival as well.Please take care of yourself, since the weather is getting colder lately. Also, I received chocolate made with the latest technology the other day. It tastes very good and warms you up when you melt it in milk. I have included the package in the letter so you can try it out yourself.From your son.]＊ ＊ ＊There was a carriage pulling away from Serendia Academy, which was celebrating its school festival. The carriage was not ornately decorated, but it was well-made and carried the flag of  Marquis Highon, one of the most prestigious noble families in the kingdom. In such a carriage, Myra Wayne sat with a shrinking body.Myra was an ordinary woman in her mid-thirties. Her appearance which belonged to a commoner was hardly adequate to fit into this magnificent carriage. She was aware of this, so she sat hunched over, trying to reduce her presence in the carriage as much as possible.\nThe carriage was comfortable to ride in. It was incomparable to the cheap carriages on the streets. Even so, Myra couldn't help but feel her face tense.Sitting across from Myra was a middle-aged man with dark hair and a mustache—A man of much higher status than Myra—Marquis Highon. To Myra, the fact that they were even now riding in the same carriage was hard to believe.Marquis Highon opened his mouth while playing with his mustache as Myra looked at him with trepidation.\"To be honest, I never thought you'd ask me to bring you to attend the school festival… I didn't mean to imply that you'd be a nuisance.\"Marquis stopped Myra, who reflexively tried to apologize, with a wave of his hand.Myra has a habit of saying, \"I am sorry, I am sorry,\" regardless of whether she is at fault or not. Her habit came from her late husband who would abuse her and raise his hand whenever he didn't like her. That's why Myra's gaze is always hovering around her feet, and if she looks up once in a while, she will unconsciously see someone else's face.Even so, while Myra was looking at the complexion of him, Marquis continued his words with his blue eyes slightly down.\"I see you're having difficulty dealing with Cyril.\"\nThe Marquis' words struck her heart really hard. Myra's face contorted into tears, and she covered her face with her hands.\"…yeah, that's right. That boy was just too… much like his father.\"Myra's late husband might have shared the blood of the Highon family, but it didn't mean its prestige would be shared down to him. And yet, he insisted that he was a member of that noble family… As a result, he became isolated from his surroundings, lost his job, and ended up drowning in alcohol before his death. And Myra herself has always been unable to stand having a son who looks so much like her late husband.\"Every time he proudly told me that he received the highest grade in school, I felt afraid he would end up like his father.\"Perhaps, Cyril just wanted her compliment ever since he was young. He wanted her to praise him ‘Well done, you did a great job.' However, Myra was unable to say even such a commonplace compliment. She had a feeling that if she complimented him, he would grow up and become a proud person like his father.\"…I'm not expecting him to have a good grade. I just want him to be normal like the others… \"But Cyril was a brilliant and hardworking person. He kept striving, believing that if he worked harder, his mother would surely praise him. Eventually, Marquis Highon recognized his achievement, offered him financial support and adoption. At that time Cyril must have thought, ‘I'm sure my mother will praise me for this.'However, Myra pushed Cyril away.——I knew it, you really are from a noble family.Myra still can't forget the hurt look on Cyril's face when she said those words to him.\"Lord Marquis, you asked me why did I ask you to bring me to the school festival when I have been stubbornly refusing to see Cyril? The truth is, I was planning to see his face for the last time today, and never see him again after.\"Myra knew what kind of life her son was leading because she received letters from Cyril every month.Cyril, who was chosen as the second prince's aide and became the vice president of the student council, was living a fulfilling student life. He had been behaving in a manner befitting a child of a noble family. People around him also expect him to do so.Cyril was living as a respectable nobleman. And as a commoner mother like herself, she shouldn't get involved with him anymore.—Or so Myra thought to herself.\"Today… I met a simple and docile girl… she complimented him a lot… and told me how kind he is… To think a girl like that had complimented Cyril so earnestly.\"Myra sniffed once before squeezing out a faint voice.\"She even told me that the flower in her possession was given by him.\"Each time Myra was crying after being abused by her late husband, the young Cyril always picked up a flower for her and said, ‘Mother, please don't cry, look at this beautiful flower, I'm sure you will feel better after looking at this.'\nCyril had always tried his best to please his mother in any way he could. And yet, Myra always rejected Cyril and never responded to any of his letters. Even the chocolate package he had sent to her a while ago hadn't been opened yet.\"…So when I heard that girl speak about Cyril, I finally realized. I had been too afraid to face the true nature of my son after having been haunted by the face of my late husband.\"The Marquis glanced at the downcast Myra and muttered to himself.\"Since we first met, Cyril has been the kind of boy who craves approval. That's why he is so ambitious. Even when he realized that he was no match for Claudia, he didn't slack down but started learning magic to acquire his own unique weapon instead.\"By the time Marquis realized his tendency to push himself too hard, Cyril had already developed a constitution that absorb mana abnormally after overworking his body in training. Cyril was so afraid at that time, thinking that he would be abandoned by the Marquis family. Of course, Marquis didn't intend to do that, so he asked the Seven Sages to create a brooch to discharge his excess mana.\"He may still be inexperienced, but he is diligent, hardworking, and ambitious. I expect him to follow in my footsteps in the future.\"\"Thank you so much…\"\"But that doesn't mean I'm going to forbid him to see you, his own mother. Though I would let him if he wants to visit his birthplace, Cyril is always hesitant when I told him so… I guess he is still afraid that you will reject him.\"Myra swallowed her words and Marquis said in a calm tone.\"You should write him a letter. The sooner you repair your relationship, the better.\"＊ ＊ ＊After arriving home, Myra draped her stole over the back of her chair and pulled out a package of chocolates that she had kept in the cupboard. Carefully opening the seal, she followed the instructions in the letter to prepare the chocolate. The chocolate tasted sweet and delicious. Its soft sweetness evoked her old memories.\"Mother, why does that man always hit you?\"\"Cyril, you shouldn't refer to your father as ‘that man'.\"\"But, I don't understand. If I were him I would never raise my hand to someone I care about. I mean, If I see someone I cared about was crying or depressed I would make them something sweet and tasty to drink.\"\"Right. If you ever find a girl you like, I'm sure you'll do it for her.\"Sipping a bit of the warm, sweet-smelling chocolate, Myra carefully scribbled out the words on the letterhead.[If you have time during winter break, please come back home.I'll make you your favorite stew.Also, I would love to hear about your school life.From your mother.P.S. Thank you for the chocolate. It was delicious.]",

      "content": "The sunset had sunk to the horizon and the evening sky was beginning to fade into the colors of the night. The faint remnants of the setting sun cast a silhouette of a slender man on the roof of the boys' dormitory of Serendia Academy.\n*sneeze*\nLouis Miller was sitting there, quivering in the blowing north wind, blowing his nose.\nHe, who came to the school festival to support Monica Everett the [Silent Witch] was now in the middle of guarding the second prince on her behalf.\nJust as he had predicted, the assassin from the chess tournament has reappeared at the school after the latter used a body manipulation spell to disguise himself as a student of the school.\nRealizing in the nick of time, Monica engaged the assassins in battle. In the end, the assailant made her inhale poison, resulting in her being unable to move for the time being.\nAlthough Monica's familiar seemed to have gone to her rescue on his own, there was not much he could do as a familiar. So Louis had no choice but to send Lynn to help Monica.\nIf it were possible, he would like to pursue the assassins, but since the second prince was safe, he changed his priority to provide protection for [Silent Witch].\nThey couldn't afford to lose a talent like her in a place like this.\nThat is how much Louis Miller values the talent of Monica Everett the [Silent Witch].\n\"Sir Louis, I have returned.\"\nA beautiful woman in a maid's uniform softly landed on the roof. Her appearance without a cloak gave off a sense of frigidity, but as a high-ranking wind spirit, Lynn did not feel any cold.\nAfter dispelling his mana sensing, Louis erected a barrier to block wind and cold air, took out a small bottle of liquor from his pocket, and gulped down the contents. There's no better way to warm up a cold body quickly than with strong liquor.\nLetting out a breath that reeked of alcohol, Louis turned his eyes to Lynn.\n\"How's Monica's condition?\"\n\"She is suffering from a minor illness. She said she would continue to attend the evening ball after this.\"\n\"In that case, I may as well be going now. I've made Rosalie waiting in the carriage already.\"\nWhile security is necessary even at a ball, honestly speaking, not many people would dare to try to kill the second prince at a ball. The fact that all the students were gathered in one place makes the security much tighter, making a crowded place unsuitable for assassination.\nBut I wonder what the purpose of the assassins was… If their goal was to assassinate the second prince, there were easier ways to do it.\nThe only thing they did was approach the second prince in disguise. Although he had used his mana sensing to search the entire school, there was no indication that anything had been tampered with at the school.\n\"Lynn, you're listening in on the conversation between the assassin and Monica, weren't you? Didn't the assassins say anything about their purpose?\"\n\"Yes, they were talking about something. It was…\"\nLynn nodded her head and replayed the conversation she had heard in an inexpressive voice.\n\"…' have you confirmed that matters?' ‘Yeah, I’ve confirmed it at a close range while pretending to be getting rid of a spider that latched on him. It’s the work of the traitor Arthur… That person’s prediction was right.'…\nthat's all\n.\"\n\"Confirming at close range? The traitor Arthur?\"\nThe name \"Arthur\" was commonly used by people from the Empire. Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that the assassins were people affiliated with the Empire.\nThen again, why would someone from the Empire have gone through the trouble for approaching the Second Prince?\nAnd, who is the traitor Arthur?\nDon't tell me…\nOne hypothesis ran through Louis' mind. It was too far-fetched and ridiculous to even consider. But if this were true… it would make sense given the fact that the [Star Oracle Witch] was no longer able to read the fate of the Second Prince.\nHas His Majesty been dimly aware of this? …which is why he sent me here, to catch their tails?\nHowever, this hypothesis was not something one could rashly inquire about to the king. If he's not careful, Louis' head will be sent flying for impudence.\nFirstly, he needed to validate this hypothesis.\nAnd to complete it, he must…\nThe question is whether or not there is a person named \"Arthur\" around the second prince. And perhaps that person will be the key in this situation.\nIf Louis' hypothesis is correct, this case will be a major event that will shake the whole kingdom.\nLouis cupped his hand over his mouth, letting out ‘kukuku' voices.\n\"Sir Louis, your face looks like a villain plotting his evil scheme.\"\n\"Now that's rude, to even call me a villain. It's just, the thought of Duke Crockford's downfall just made me smile with delight.\"\nIf his assumption is proved to be true, Duke Crockford will be destroyed along with the Second Prince. He has no reason to show mercy, as he has no favorable feelings for them.\nBut I think it would be best to keep this a secret from that little girl… she's a little too easily moved by emotion.\nThere was no telling how Monica would react if she found out that the Second Prince would be doomed.\nTherefore, it would be appropriate to keep this speculation under wraps until the last minute.\nSerendia Academy will soon enter its winter break. The Second Prince will be returning to the palace during that period, and Monica's escort duties will come to halt.\nWhile Monica takes a break, I may as well do some digging on the person named Artur.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nA few days later after the Serendia School Festival, while Louis was working on paperwork in his study at home, Lynn knocked on the door of his room.\n\"Excuse me for my intrusion.\"\nWith that, Lynn stepped into the room carrying a tray of tea sets in her hands, and an owl on her head.\nRight, an own on her head.\nAs Louis positioned his shifting monocle and stared above Lynn's head, the latter placed the tea set on the side table in a very natural gesture.\n\"I've brought you some tea.\"\n\"What's that bird?\"\n\"It landed on my head while I was cleaning the garden. I'm thinking of naming it and raising it for myself.\"\nThough he wanted to retort, soon Louis noticed the anklet on the owl's leg.\nIt was an anklet bearing a crest in the shape of a star.\n\"Lynn, give up on keeping that owl at all. It's a familiar of Star Oracle Witch.\"\nAttached to the anklet of the owl was a small tube to hold the letter. Taking a small rolled-up letter from the owl's anklet perched on Lynn's head, Louis unfolded it.\n——\nAccording to the results of the star reading, there are signs of dragon damage in the near future, the Seven Sages should be prepared for emergencies.\nDisasters caused by dragons, known as dragon damage, are not that uncommon in this country.\nWhether it's a herd of small herbivorous dragons destroying fields or a large dragon attacking people or livestock, dragon damage is an everyday occurrence in the eastern part of the Ridill Kingdom.\nBut the fact that the [Star Oracle Witch] sent a message to warn him…\n\"A Wicked Dragon, or maybe a Cursed Dragon will appear…\"\nAmong the dragons, there's a particular dragon that has intelligence and is harmful to people called Wicked Dragon, and a dragon, regardless of its intelligence, spreads some kind of \"curse\" in its surroundings called Cursed Dragon.\nBoth of these dragons are extremely dangerous. Disasters caused by Wicked Dragons and Cursed Dragons are of a different order of magnitude in terms of damage. One wrong move and the country could be destroyed.\n\"…looks like there will be no winter break for the Seven Sages.\"\nAmong the Seven Sages, the three with the highest combat abilities are Cannon Magician, Barrier Magician, and the least known Silent Witch. The remaining four are not really suited for combat. Because of it, the three combat-oriented individuals would be sent to fight.\nI was hoping to spend the winter break with Rosalie…\nAs Louis sighed, Lynn grabbed the owl above her head with both hands and began to stare closely at it. The owl was completely frightened by this.\n\"… Lynn, please stop threatening other people's familiar.\"\n\"I'm not threatening it, I'm simply observing it. Does this owl speak human language?\"\n\"…what?\"\nLouis wrinkled his brow and gave Lynn a small, mocking look.\n\"It's not a parrot. How can an owl speak human languages?\"\n\"Doesn't a familiar have the ability to understand human language?\"\nIt seems that Lynn didn't know much about familiars. To begin with, familiars are not something people see very often, so it's not surprising.\n\"Good grief…\" Exhaling a sigh of exasperation, Louis crossed his legs and leaned his back against the back of the chair.\n\"Familiars may understand simple words, but they can't speak human language. They are somewhat smarter than normal animals, but in the end, they are still animals.\"\nA familiar is an animal that has been given a share of mana through a master-servant relationship with a magician.\nTherefore, they can only understand simple commands from a magician, but even then, what they can do is still limited to that of an animal. That is why whenever a person wants to send a message, it is necessary to attach a letter in its anklet. Compared to a contracted spirit, it may require less magical power, but the range of what it can do is far less.\nAfter hearing Louis' explanation, Lynn fell silent, still holding onto the owl. This was rare for this self-paced spirit to be so confused about something. Lynn made a thoughtful gesture and then looked at Louis with eyes that were more emotionless than the owl.\n\"Then, can a familiar turn into a human being, read novels, or sing merrily saying ‘Yay, I'm the best!'?\"\n\"How can there be such a familiar in the first place? You yourself know very well that it takes a lot of mana for a non-human to turn into a human. The only ones who can change into humans are spirits or higher beings.\"\nLynn stared at the owl with a blank expression and cocked her head.\n\"Then…?\"",

      "content": "Boys' Dormitory.\nFelix was sitting on the sofa in his room, polishing his pocket watch. A custom-made one, with the royal crest emblazoned in silver. However, what was important to him was neither the royal crest nor the function of the watch, but the item hidden underneath it.\nFelix closed the once opened lid, twisted the bottom part of the pocket watch slightly then opened the lid again. Afterward, a panel, hidden underneath the hour digits cover, was revealed.\nThe panel was inlaid with a large aquamarine, around which was engraved a magical formula that signified a contract with a spirit. It was the proof of his contract with his contracted spirit, Wildeanu.\nAquamarine itself was not unusual, but the darker the color, the more expensive it was considered to be. And the aquamarine on Felix's hand was exactly the kind of light blue that deserves to be called top quality.\nThis aquamarine was once the necklace of a certain noblewoman. It was said that the lady who wore this necklace had very beautiful aqua eyes, just like this aquamarine.\nThough he will never be able to see that aqua color again.\nClosing the lid of his pocket watch with a snap, Will, who was sorting through the letters, called out reservedly.\n\"Your Highness, you've received a letter from Duke Crockford.\"\n\"Pass it to me.\"\nFelix picked up the letter on the tray and cut the seal with a paper-knife. What was written in the letter were roughly things that he had expected.\n\"I've been assigned a diplomatic task. Envoys from the Falforia Kingdom were coming to the Duchy of Rehnberg and I was asked to welcome them.\"\n\"I believe Duke Rehnberg is…\"\n\"Yes, he's Eliane's father.\"\nIn other words, Duke Crockford's order can be summarized as follows.\nOnce the winter break begins, stay in Duchy of Rehnberg and make some results in diplomacy with the Farforia Kingdom. Also, he had to deepen his relationship with Eliane, his fiancee candidate while she stays there.\nThe Falforia Kingdom was an agricultural country situated southeast of the Ridill Kingdom. The details of the diplomacy will undoubtedly be related to trade. Of course, they were an important ally for the Ridill Kingdom.\nNow that relations with the Empire were very delicate, if the Falforia Kingdom and the Empire were to join forces, the Ridill Kingdom would be caught in the middle.\nHe will have to entertain them to strengthen the alliance while extracting some results from the trade deal.\nAs for Eliane, well, I guess that's just a bonus.\nHaving Felix stay at her parents' house would make Eliane very eager indeed.\nAfter all, Eliane was favored by Duke Crockford. Now that she had Duke Crockford's approval, Eliane must already feel like she is Felix's fiancee.\n…Well, rather than liking Eliane personally, Duke Crockford is probably pushing Eliane because his father, Duke Rehnberg, is someone he can easily control…\nWhatever it may be, it's going to be a depressing winter break.\nThe air was somewhat lively with the other student council members all seemingly looking forward to returning home.\nIn particular, Cyril was unusually excited this year and was now preparing souvenirs and counting the days until he would return home.\n\"How envious,\" sighed Felix as he read the letter, but he stopped at the last sentence. His eyes widened, tinted in red.\nWill, who had been watching him, called out to Felix with concern.\n\"…Um, Your Highness?\"\n\"Will, I've got some good news!\"\nUnlike his usual way of speaking, Felix said this rapidly before tracing the last sentence of the letter with his finger.\n\"Lady Everett… I would be able to meet with her!\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nIsabelle Norton haughtily raised her chin.\n\"This should be a peaceful New Year's day with my family, but now I have to spend my days with someone like you, what a spiteful day! I would never approve of you as one of my family! You should better have spent this winter in a stable!\" So spat Isabelle at Monica with a hateful look on her face, and the next moment she collapsed in tears on the spot.\n\"…so, with that pretext, I should be able to invite you to my house. Then we can spend our winter breaks together in our household, Big Sis Monica!\"\nAs Isabelle cried in tears, Monica perpexedly spoke, \"I-I'm sorry.\"\nMonica, who had been busy with the chess tournament and the school festival for a while now, had been invited to Isabelle's private room for a tea party. And now, they were discussing the winter breaks.\nEveryone seemed to be talking happily about how they would spend their winter breaks now that it was less than a week away.\nSerendia Academy has two long breaks a year, one in the winter and one in the summer, but only during the winter break do they encourage all students to return home and close the dormitories completely.\nDue to the fact that many social events took place during the long summer vacation, and because Serendia Academy is relatively close to the royal capital, students from distant places often go directly from their dormitories to the parties in the royal capital.\nOn the other hand, students are encouraged to return home for the winter breaks, since people in the Ridill Kingdom believed winter solstice should be spent with family.\nIt was also due on the longest night of the year during the winter solstice, the Spirit King of Darkness will return to his slumber, while the Spirit King of Light will awaken on the following day, marking the beginning of a new year.\nDuring the week until the winter solstice, it is customary in this country for nobles and commoners alike to spend a quiet time with their families.\nAfter the winter solstice, the palace would hold a New Year's ceremony for a week, and the nobles from the various regions would visit the palace to greet the king.\nThis ceremony takes a whole week and Monica, who happens to be one of the Seven Sages, is required to attend from day one.\nThat's why she can't visit Kerbeck County which is located far away from the palace.\n\"I'm really sorry…\"\n\"Please stop apologizing to me, Big Sis Monica. I know this is just my selfishness… Even so… I really want to eat meat pie and ginger cake together with you and show you around the attractions of our Kerbeck County…\"\n\"My Lady, your words would only make Miss Silent Witch troubled.\"\nWhen her maid, Agatha, mildly chided her, Isabelle looked up and wiped her face with her handkerchief.\n\"Ah, I can't continue like this. A villainous daughter should not be crying for real… The only cries a villainess ever sheds are supposed to be crying out of lies.\"\n\"I-Is that so…?\"\nMonica shuddered involuntarily, and Isabelle's face, which had been crumpled in tears, straightened up.\n\"I apologize for showing you such unseemly conduct. As much as I'd like to enjoy the winter break with you, it wouldn't be appropriate if I forced you to come, considering the current situation.\"\nThe current situation, at the mention of those words Isabelle and Agatha's expressions darkened.\n——Our kingdom has foreseen a sign of dragon damage in the country.\nIt was a week ago that Mary Harvey, the country's foremost prophetess, the Star Oracle Witch, made that prophecy. The king immediately sent out notices throughout the country, ordering the people to be on the alert for the dragon.\nBy nature, dragons that are vulnerable to cold weather become active in early spring. Making winter the season with the least dragon damage.\nHowever, once the Star Oracle Witch made her prophecy, everyone has no choice but to be wary. After all, she has predicted calamities that could bring down this country many times in the past.\nAnd if dragon damage were to occur, the most dangerous area would be the eastern part of the country, where there are many mountain ranges. Kerbeck County is also included in this region. That's why Isabelle was lamenting the fact that she couldn't bring Monica along.\n\"I-I heard the king wouldn't only dispatch the Dragon Knights, but also the Seven Sages to anticipate the dragon damage… And maybe… I'll also be dispatched to your region.\"\n\"Oh my! If that happens, please do let me know, by all means, I really meant it! So we can do our utmost effort to provide you with a warm welcome! The Kerbeck Household also will do our best to support you in slaying the dragon, Big Sis Monica!\"\n\"Um… I'm fine… So please spare some manpower to guard the territory…\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAs Monica left Isabelle's room and walked down the hallway, she somehow recalled last year's New Year. As the Seven Sages, she had to stay at the castle from the first day of the New Year's ceremony.\nHowever, Monica was so busy developing a new magic formula at the cabin at that time and forgot about the New Year's ceremony completely… As a result, soon after the start of the New Year, Louis, grabbed her by the neck and took her to the castle using his flight spell.\nLouis looked so scary back then…\nThinking back about that day, Monica climbed up the ladder and pushed up the attic's door.\n\"Here we go. I'm home, Nero.\"\n\"Welcome back.\"\nBut the one who answered Monica's voice as she pushed up the door and climbed into the attic was not Nero. Of course, it was not Lynn either.\nSitting on the window sill, crossing his legs, was a good-looking magician with his chestnut hair in a braid wearing a monocle—Louis Miller the Barrier Magician.\nMonica was silent for a good ten seconds and then asked in a shaky voice.\n\"Was today… the day of the New Year's ceremony?\"\nIf it were the usual Louis, he would have said, \"My colleague, it seems you are still half asleep, should I sober up your senses now?\" and grinding her head with his fist, but today, he seemed to be awfully quiet and responded with a prompt reply.\n\"…Things have gone very bad.\"\nLouis Miller is a man who would smile even in ‘bad situations,' while sometimes laughing at it wryly. Now that Louis had told Monica that things have gone very bad. Looking at the current circumstances, even Monica thinks the case where Louis says, \"Today's a New Year's ceremony\" and grabbing her by the neck and dragging her away was far better than this.",

      "content": "\"Miss Monica Everett the Silent Witch… I want you to escort His Highness, the Second Prince Felix Ark Ridill.\"\nMonica was perplexed at Louis' words.\n\"…Um, is just the same thing with what I've been doing now?\"\nUp until now, Monica had been carrying a mission to escort the second prince while hiding her true identity.\nSo it was a bit anti-climatic when Monica, who had been bracing herself for a very bad situation heard that answer, but the grave expression on Louis' face was still there and he shook his head.\n\"I'm not talking about a secret mission, but an official escort mission.\"\n\"…huh?\"\n\"Soon, an emissary from the Kingdom Farforia will be visiting our kingdom. A discussion regarding a diplomatic trade will be held, and it has been decided that the Second Prince will be attending.\"\nIt was not unusual for Felix to be present at diplomatic trade with neighboring countries. Having been on the diplomatic scene since he was in his early teens, he has a track record of negotiating several important deals.\n\"The place of the meeting will be situated at the Duchy of Rehnberg, the southeastern part of the kingdom, an area which has been categorized as dragon damage's area.\"\nMonica's face tightened as she started to comprehend the situation, and then she asked Louis.\n\"C-Could it be… my mission is to escort him there?\"\n\"That's right. And since this is an official escort mission, you are required to be present with the Second Prince and act as Silent Witch.\"\nTo Monica's dismay, Louis delivered an even more shocking revelation.\n\"It was not the worst yet…\"\n\"Is there any worse situation than this…!?\"\n\"Of course, it is. My stupid disciple is going to accompany you on that escort mission.\"\nLouis' disciple—in other words, the always energetic and loud person, Glenn Dudley, will accompany her.\n\"H-h-h-h-how things… had become like this…\"\n\"This mission was originally intended to be given both of us, you and I. However, the old codgers in the capital who were frightened by the prophecy of dragon damage insisted that the Barrier Magician stays in the capital.\"\nIn terms of barrier magic, there is no one in this country who can match Louis.\nIf it is only the speed of putting up the barriers, Monica can do it faster than him as she has no chanting ability, but in terms of the strength, accuracy, and duration of the barriers, Louis is by far the best. For this reason, some people even call Louis the ‘Guardian Deity of the Kingdom'.\n\"‘Come to think of it, I heard Master Barrier Magician have an excellent apprentice. In that case, how about sending his apprentice on the escort mission. That should settle the matter, hahaha.' …this is what the rotten minister had suggested. This opinion was approved easily and that's how it became like this. Yeah.\"\nApparently, Glenn's great performance on the play in the school festival had caught the attention of the minister and the head of the Knight Order. As such, they thought a talented disciple like him should be able to serve as His Highness' bodyguard.\nOf course, Louis was against it…but now the country was short of manpower to deal with the dragon damage, Louis tried to put an argument forward, instead of sending that idiot disciple, it would have been better to send the Silent Witch alone, but it was rejected.\nThe words that out from Louis' mouth were filled with anger, and his good-looking face was contorted viciously. The thing is, what frightened Monica was not his vicious face.\nI have to officially escort His Highness as Silent Witch? Along with Glenn? While hiding my true identity!?\nNo matter how one looked at it, it was reckless. Regardless of how tightly she covered her face with her hood, if she opened her mouth, she would be exposed at once.\n\"Bu-bu-bu-but… I-I would be exposed instantly if I spoke…\"\n\"So I am thinking of adding an attendant to accompany you, so he/she can speak for you. Is there anyone you know who knows your true identity and is tight-lipped?\"\nUnfortunately, Monica Everett the Silent Witch doesn't have any such acquaintances.\nThe only person who knew Monica and knew her true identity was Barney Jones, but he was too busy preparing for his inheriting the Count's family, so she probably couldn't make him serve as her attendant.\nThat would mean… I would have to ask Nero to turn into a human and act as my attendant…\nBut would that Nero be willing to act as an attendant? Moreover, he would be required to speak on Monica's behalf. She felt nothing but anxiety.\nAs Monica held her churning stomach, Louis also rubbed his temple looking like he had a headache.\n\"…Anyway, this matter has been decided. Quickly find a person who will become your attendant.\"\n\"Y-Yes…\"\n\"As for my idiot disciple, I'll be sure to give him a very strict reminder not to talk to or bother you any more than necessary.\"\n\"P-Please do…\"\nAlthough Glenn tends to be friendly towards everyone, he gets too close due to his personality.\nWhy are you covering your eyes with a hood, Lady Silent Witch? Why are you not speaking?—she could imagine him approaching her in curiosity with these questions.\n\"In any case, you'll need your formal robe and a staff. Just to make sure, both your items were at your mountain lodge, right?\"\nMonica nodded at his inquiry.\nThe kingdom had granted the Seven Sages special-made robes and staffs for each person. However, since she had to hide her true identity while infiltrating the Serendia Academy, she left that equipment at her mountain lodge.\n\"We're running out of time, so I will take a quick flight with my flight magic to retrieve it. Is your robe in the wardrobe?\"\n\"Y-Yes…\"\nMonica had very few clothes which made her wardrobe look so hollow. Since she had shoved her formal robe there, it wouldn't be too difficult for him to find it.\n\"What about your staff? You won't tell me it is buried in some papers or something, right?\"\n\"N-No, I don't use the staff very often, so…\"\nThe staff may be a symbol for a magician, but in fact, even without it, it doesn't affect the use of magic very much. Though it can be a sort of magic tool to temporarily stabilize or amplify mana, if the said magician was at the level of the Seven Sages, its usefulness will be a little to almost non-existent.\nAnd since the staffs of magicians generally tend to be made longer as their rank increases, the staff of the Seven Sages, the highest rank of magicians, was needlessly made very long.\nIn fact, it was longer than Monica herself and the decoration itself took up a lot of space, so keeping it in the cabin would be a hindrance to her work. So…\n\"…I put my staff… at the garden…\"\n\"Garden?\"\n\"As clothesline…\"\nIn response, Louis Miller was lost for words while putting the most contorted face he had ever shown.",

      "content": "After the ceremony at Serendia Academy was over, Eliane hurried back to her room in the dormitory to change her dress.\nShe changed from her uniform to her casual dress, fixed her makeup, and changed her hairstyle.\n\"The pink hat with a ribbon I had bought not a long ago should be a perfect match for this hairstyle.\"\n\"Understood.\"\nWithout saying anything, the maid took the hat she wanted out of her travel bag and put it on Eliane.\nEliane stood in front of the full-length mirror to check her appearance. A brand new coat engulfed with a scarf, on top of her head was a hat with the most fashionable design of today. A beautiful, delicate girl that everyone would want to praise as adorable was what reflected on the mirror.\nSince I'm going to be riding in the same carriage as Lord Felix, I have to make sure I'm dressed perfectly.\nEliane was in high spirits. Now that the winter break was approaching, Felix would be staying at Eliane's house. How could she not be excited about this?\nFelix would spend the first two days of the winter break at the Hyatt's mansion, and then diplomacy would follow when the emissaries from the Falforia Kingdom arrived. And Eliane's role is to provide hospitality for Felix and the envoys from the neighboring countries.\nThis was the perfect opportunity to show off her good point to Felix.\nAccording to her father, the one who set up this diplomacy was Duke Crockford, Eliane's great uncle. In other words, all these events took place because they had been arranged by him.\nShe must definitely take this chance to secure her place as Felix's fiancee.\n…If necessary, she just has to make it an established fact.\nIf by any chance… yes, by any chance, Lord Felix wandered into my bedroom… of course, I would never do anything so immodest as to seduce him, but if Lord Felix were to be enticed by the sight of me in my nightgown, the two of us might end up together until morning… though it's only my assumption. Of course, I won't ask him out. It's only if Lord Felix is willing for it… and to make that happen, I have my maid to make some preparation…\nEliane adjusted the ribbon around her collar while constructing many plots to lead Felix to her bedroom.\n\"My Lady, it's almost time for the carriage to arrive.\"\n\"Alright, I'll be there soon.\"\nSmiling back at the maid, Eliane walked out of the dormitory.\nMany carriages were lined up in front of the Serendia Academy, awaiting their master returning their household. Among them, a particularly beautiful carriage belonging to Dukes Rehnburg stood out the most.\nShe was going to meet up with Felix in front of this carriage. Those who saw Felix getting into the same carriage as Eliane would surely spread rumors. The Second Prince had chosen Eliane as his fiancee and he's spending the winter break at Eliane's home.\nOh, what a wonderful feeling!\nAware of all eyes were turned to the carriage of Duke Rehnburg's family, Eliane suppressed her desire to skip and stepped forward with the ladylike grace of a daughter of the upper class.\nAs you can see, standing in front of the carriage was a beautiful prince that everyone turns to, waiting for her…\n\"Huh? Aren't you the one who played Amelia's role? …hmm, who was it again?\"\n\"She is Miss Elaine Hyatt.\"\nThe one who spoke in a ridiculously loud and rude voice was not her prince, but Glenn Dudley, who had performed together with Eliane on the play at the school festival. And the one who told him her name was Felix who's been standing beside him, which the latter clapped his hands afterward.\n\"Oh, that's right! Eliane, Eliane… wait, why Eliane is here?\"\nIt should be my line!\nWhy was Glenn Dudley talking with Felix in front of the carriage of Duke Rehnberg's family?\n\"Dudley. She's the daughter of Duke Rehnberg.\"\n\"Oh, I had no idea! Hmm, it would have been easier to understand if you had named Eliane Rehnburg Hyatt.\"\n\"It was a title named after the name of their managed territory.\"\n\"Is that so?\"\n\"It is.\"\n\"By the way, why it was ‘named' that way?\nShe felt like she was going to lose her mind if she listened to this conversation any longer. So Eliane plastered a dainty smile on her face, which was about to collapse.\n\"Good day, Lord Felix. It's been a while, Lord Dudley. We haven't seen each other since the play.\"\nEliane subtly insisted to the people around her that she had no relationship or anything with Glenn, except when they had performed together in the play. Unfortunately, that thought of hers was torn to shreds by Glenn's.\n\"I'm not good with formalities, so just call me Glenn! Especially since we're going to be taking care of each other from now on! So feel free to call me by my name.\"\n\"…pardon?\"\nWhat did he mean by \"we're going to be taking care of each other from now on\"?\nAt Eliane's confusion, Felix explained with a gentle smile.\n\"In my stay at the Duke of Rehnburg's household, Lady Everett, the Silent Witch of the Seven Sages, and Dudley, the apprentice of the Barrier Magician, will be accompanying me as my guards.\"\nWhat!?\nTo Eliane's exclamation, Glenn gave her a smile as dazzling as the sun, then said.\n\"Since that's the case! I'm looking forward to working with you during the winter break!\"\nThe surrounding students were certainly focusing their attention on Eliane and the two. However, she's not hoping to be ended in this way.\nNot only were the surroundings looking at her lack of envious, but it was also full of curiosity. Even so, Eliane showed her gentle smile, though inwardly she stomped on the ground.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nIn a carriage for four people with two seats for two people each facing each other, it should be a matter of fact for Eliane to sit beside Felix. It should be a matter of fact, but why did Felix sit beside Glenn?\n\"Lord Felix, would it feel a bit cramped for two men to be sitting there side by side?\" expressed Eliane her concern subtly, to which Felix responded with a beautiful smile.\n\"Not at all, in fact, I feel this carriage was more spacious and comfortable than I'd thought. Besides, Dudley is my bodyguard.\"\nSince she was told that it was more appropriate for his guard to sit next to him, she had nothing to say back. It should be the development of her stumbling on Felix's chest as the carriage rocked, or leaning on his shoulder pretending to take a little nap!\nAs Eliane ground her teeth inwardly, Glenn lifted his gaze and looked at Eliane as if he had noticed something.\nHave you finally realized what I'm thinking? That's right, you should be more sensible.\n\"No need to worry, Eliane! I'll make sure to protect not only President but also you as well!\"\nThat's not the thing she wanted him concerned about.\nAfter forcibly swallowing the almost spoken words of ‘I am not expecting you to protect me,' she gave him a dainty smile.\n\"Oh my, how reassuring to be protected by you, Lord Glenn.\"\n\"You can count on me! By the way, I think spelling the name ‘Eliane' is a bit hard, so can I call you just Ellie?\"\nThere's no way you can! Eliane almost blurted out those words, but then she thought.\nIf she allowed Glenn to call her Ellie, then following that conversation, she can beg Felix, ‘Could you call me Ellie too, Lord Felix?' With that notion, it's highly likely Felix would call her Ellie, wouldn't it?\nEliane responded with an ambiguous smile that could not be described as either a denial or an affirmation and then shifted her gaze to Felix in a perfectly natural gesture.\n\"Lord Felix, could you…\"\n…call me Ellie? Before she could finish, she saw Felix's head shake.\nFelix's long golden eyelashes were downcast, and he looked somewhat sleepy. It seems that he had been dozing off without really listening to Eliane.\n\"Umm… Lord Felix?\"\n\"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a little sleep-deprived… I was really looking forward to today, and I didn't get much sleep last night.\"\nEliane's mood, which had been declining, suddenly rose after hearing Felix's words.\nI had no idea that Lord Felix was looking forward to coming to my house this much!\nWouldn't this be a good sign for a love relationship?\nEliane concealed the joy that was welling up in her and said to Felix concernedly.\n\"Please take it easy and get some rest, Lord Felix.\"\n\"Yeah. I would do that.\"\nFelix rested his cheek on the arm he leaned against the armrest and closed his eyes.\nWhile Eliane was enraptured by the beauty of Felix's sleeping profile, Glenn poked and prodded Eliane.\n\"…do you need something, Lord Glenn?\"\n\"I'm bored just looking at the scenery, so why don't we play a game? I brought a lot of stuff from my house just for today.\"\n\"Lord Felix is asleep, I don't think we should make too much noise…\"\n\"I'll keep my voice down, so don't worry. Now, look at this coin~\"\nGlenn pulled a single copper coin out of his pocket and flicked it with his right hand, then caught it again with his right hand. After cupping both his right and left hands, he held them out in front of Eliane.\n\"Which one's got the coins in it?\"\n\"…right hand…\"\nGlenn smiled and opened his hands, the result was a coin in his left hand. Eliane couldn't help but round her eyes.\n\"What? What? How? I saw you catch it with your right hand.\"\n\"Okay, one more time.\"\nGlenn flicked the coin with his right hand and caught it with his right hand. Eliane watched the movement of the coin without blinking. She was certain that the coin was held in his right hand.\n\"It's in the right hand again.\"\n\"Too bad, you were wrong~\"\n\"What!?\"\nEliane involuntarily leaned forward and stared at the coin. This kind of trick was a common stunt in street, but Eliane, a young lady whose life was restricted to high society, had never seen a street performance or a commoner's trick.\n\"You're cheating. You used magic, didn't you?\"\n\"I didn't do any chanting, though. And my master told me that it was impossible to teleport an object with human mana.\"\nAnd what Glenn said was a fact. So Elaine could only pout while staring intently at Glenn's right hand.\n\"Please do it one more time, okay, one more time.\"\n\"Okay, I'll raise the difficulty level a little this time.\"\n\"Eh!? But I haven't even figured out the trick of the first one yet!\"\nFelix, who had been dozing off resting his cheek on his hand, opened one eye thinly and put a small smile on his lips after looking at Glenn and Eliane, before closing his eyes again.\nHe found it rather amusing to listen to their conversation, but now he wanted to get some sleep.\nJust like a boy going to meet his first love, he couldn't get proper sleep last night. After all, he's going to meet the Silent Witch whom he had been admiring so much.\nFrom what he heard, Lady Silent Witch had arrived at the Duchy Rehnberg, awaiting his arrival.\n.What should he talk about when he met her—thought Felix as he back to his slumber.",

      "content": "Speaking of education, magic was a part of mandatory education. While people were not demanded to have practical experience, they were at least required to have a minimum of knowledge of it.\nIn fact, it would only be inconvenient for Duke Crockford if the boy can use them. So the boy was told to keep his hands off from practicing magic, but strangely enough, the more things that are prohibited, the more people want to touch them.\nMore than anything, the boy had magic that he really wanted to use. Magic to make a contract with a high-ranking spirit using a spirit stone.\nThe boy had studied magic on his own to achieve this before finally, he'd succeeded in doing so.\n—Are you my new master?\nUpon successfully completing the magic, a spirit appeared in the form of a young man with light blue hair. His features were neat and tidy, but his thin presence made him seem almost ignorable. While his eyes were pale in light blue, its color was paler than the aquamarine of the contract stone.\nSo, the boy smiled faintly and spoke.\n\"Spirit Wildeanu. I need your help to make my wish come true. I believe this wish should be appropriate to be fulfilled by you, a former servant of Queen Irene.\"\n—What is your wish?\nThe spirit asked in a faint voice, to which the boy replied with a very thin smile and eyes… that driven by obsession.\n\"I want to shine a certain star in the night sky.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThe vibrations brought his consciousness back to reality, and he remembered that he was in a carriage.\nAs Felix was lightly rubbing his eyes, he heard some joyful voices coming from right next to him.\n\"That's unfair, I certain you've done something to the card…\"\n\"I really haven't done anything to the cards. You're just too bad at playing card games.\"\n\"Just to let you know, I even had done like this before…\"\n\"Okay, it's my win.\"\n\"Ah, wait…!\"\nGlenn turned over the cards in his hand to reveal his hand, and Eliane scattered her own cards in her lap and squealed in frustration.\nThe cards they were using had illustrations and letters on them. It was probably a game that was popular among common children.\n\"Good morning, you look like having fun.\"\nWhen Felix called out to her, Eliane jerked her shoulders up and hid her card in a panic as she looked at him.\n\"G-Good morning, Lord Felix. I'm so sorry for making such a racket…\"\n\"No, don't worry about it. By the way, what kind of game is that?\"\n\"I-I was doing this as a part of my social studies to understand the current trends of common people…\"\nEliane seemed uncomfortable with the fact that she was playing the games of ordinary folks.\nBut Glenn didn't seem to mind as he collected the cards and said.\n\"It's a game that's popular among common folks these days. You have to collect four cards of dragon claws, scales, wings, and eyes, and the first one to complete the dragon wins. The type of dragon you complete depends on the type of parts you have, and the stronger the dragon, the higher your score. By the way, the strongest dragon is the black dragon…\"\nHe could understand how well-designed the game was after listening to Glen's explanation. Although the rules were simple enough for a beginner to understand, the game involved a lot of strategies and was surprisingly deep.\nPerhaps this game was designed to help people learn about different types of dragons through playing.\n‘That sounds interesting,' said Felix with an innocuous comment, and Glenn smiled, showing his white teeth.\n\"President, would you like to join in this round?\"\n\"I would love to, but I think we are about to reach the mansion.\"\nAs Felix looked out the window, the driver added, \"Yes, we are almost there.\"\nGlenn regretfully collected the cards and put them in his bag. In addition to the cards, the bag was filled with what looked like playthings and dried fruit for snacks. The fact that there was nothing that would be useful for the escort mission was very much like him.\nBy the time they arrived at the Duke Rehnberg Household, the sun had completely set.\nThe group was greeted by an earnest-looking middle-aged man with neatly stroked grayish blond hair.\n\"My name is Peter Sams, and I will be taking care of you for the next few days. If you have any requests, please do not hesitate to contact me.\"\nHmm, Felix cocked his head.\nFelix was vaguely remembered with Peter's face.\n\"I think I have seen your face before. Haven't you been at your grandfather's house before?\"\nPeter's eyes widen in surprise at Felix's words.\nFor a moment, a bitter expression of anxiety appeared on his face. Peter quickly regained his composure and bowed his head like a servant.\n\"It is an honor to be remembered by His Highness. Indeed. I used to be a servant of Lord Crockford.\"\nDuke Crockford and Duke Rehnburg have a deep friendship, so having a servant presented to another family is not uncommon.\nHowever, the look of anxiety that Peter showed for a moment bothered Felix.\nMaybe he had done something poorly in the Crockford family and was sent to another family. Or maybe he was a liaison between Duke Crockford and Duke Rehnberg.\nDeciding that it was probably not something to bring up at this point, Felix put that thought away.\n\"Well then, I will be in your care from today… I was just wondering, has Lady Everett arrived yet?\"\n\"Yes… oh, speak of the devil.\"\nThere were two figures walking towards them from the back of the hallway. A small figure wearing a hooded robe holding a staff in her hand, and a tall young man.\nThe small figure was wearing a hood so tightly to even hide her face from view. However, the dark blue robes and long staff that only the Seven Sages were permitted to wear indicated that this person was the Silent Witch that Felix had admired.\nBut instead of the Silent Witch, whom Felix longed to meet, he was drawn to the man standing beside her. Felix had met this man once before.\nHis black hair was slightly unruly, his eyes were golden and sharp. The man who wore an old-fashioned robe when he met before was now dressed in the kind of neat clothes you would expect an attendant would wear.\n\"You are…\"\nEliane and Glenn looked at Felix in curiosity, who could not hide his surprise.\nThe dark-haired man grinned and opened his mouth.\n\"Oh, I remember, I met Your Highness once.\"\n\"…it's been a while, Bartholomew Alexander.\"\nWhen Felix mentioned the name, the dark-haired man puffed out his chest with pride.\n\"Indeed, I am Bartholomew Alexander, servant of the Silent Witch.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nMonica was so surprised that she thought her heart would jump out of her mouth.\nWaitwaitwaitwait!????\nMonica tugged on the hem of Nero's shirt and moved to a corner of the hallway. Felix and the others were looking at the exchange curiously, but Monica was no longer in the mood for that.\n\"Oh, what's the matter, master?\"\nMonica pressed closer to Nero, who was smirking at her, killing her voice.\n\"H-H-H-How did you know His Highness, Nero?\"\n\"Hmm? I haven't told you? I encountered him when I carried Chilly Guy to the boys' dormitory.\"\n\"Y-You never told me that!\"\nIn all likelihood, the Chilly Guy he's referring to was Cyril Ashley. However, it had been three months since Monica had stopped Cyril's outburst.\nAt that time, Nero carried the unconscious Cyril to the boys' dormitory… but she never imagined that he had encountered Felix at that time!\nYou'd only told me \"I've delivered him\" at that timeeeee!\nIf Monica had known that Nero had met Felix in human form, she would never have given him the role of an attendant.\n\"And what the heck is Bartholomew Alexander? You were thinking of another alias, weren't you?\"\nSir Bartholomew Alexander was the name of the hero of a well-known adventure novel. Anyone who hears that name will think it was an alias and will suspect him to a large extent.\nNero didn't seem to feel guilty, instead, he simply stated bluntly.\n\"Alias, huh? Yeah, I forgot about it. I cannot remember the names of people I am not interested in.\"\nAt least remember your own alias!\nMonica covered her face with her hands and collapsed to her knees. This was a complete mistake on Monica's part in selecting the right personnel(?).\nBut Nero, the man responsible for the incident, seemed to have no qualms about it.\n\"It's nothing to fuss about. Only a few people have seen my humanoid form ever since the escort mission commenced.\"\nThat's right. Aside from Lynn, the only people who have seen \"Monica Norton\" working with Nero in human form at Serendia Academy were Casey during the assassination attempt and Barney during the chess tournament.\nAt least, there was no one here who would make assumptions about the connection between Nero in human form and Monica Norton. Norton.\n\"…When you met with His Highness three months ago, you didn't mention my name, did you?\"\n\"There's no way I'm bringing it out. I'm not that stupid.\"\n\"…I'll make sure to have you explain everything later… but for now, please be a good attendant, you hear me?\"\nAfter adamantly reminding him, Nero slapped his chest saying, \"Oh! Leave it to me!\" She felt uneasy, she felt nothing but uneasy. Even so, she couldn't just leave Felix and the others standing at the entrance.\nAfter pulling back her hood tightly over her eyes, Monica stood in front of Felix, bent her knees, placed her staff at her feet, and dropped to one knee. It was the utmost courtesy a vassal could show to royal family.\nBut while Monica was on her knees, Nero was standing beside her haughtily.\n\"This person is my master, Silent Witch. As the name implies, my master doesn't speak, so if you want to convey something to her, you can speak to me.\"\nEveryone in the room was taken aback by the attendant attitude who was more overbearing than his master.\nAmidst this shocking situation, Felix smiled wryly in reply.\n\"Why are you still standing while your master was kneeling down?\"\n\"Why would I kneel to you? My master is her, the Silent Witch, not you.\"\n\"Even when the royal family standing is higher than the Seven Sages?\"\n\"I don't care if you're royal family or not, I'll only kneel to someone greater than myself.\"\nNEEEERROOOOO!!\nMonica stood up silently and pounded Nero's back with her fist.\nYou can't! Be rude! To His Highness!\nNero's lips twitched in frustration as if he sensed what Monica was trying to say.\nMonica tried to get Nero to lower his head, but no matter how hard she reached, the petite Monica could not reach the tall Nero's head.\nWhile she carefully to not let anyone see the face behind her hood, Monica tiptoed to get Nero to lower his head.\nLooking at the exchange between Monica and Nero, Felix couldn't help to let out a chuckle. Despite the fact they were being rude in front of him, he acted magnanimously while showing no anger or displeasure.\n\"I see. I'll try my best to be the kind of person you want to kneel down to one day.\"\n\"Oh, good luck.\"\nWith her no-chant spell, Monica created a mass of wind to hit Nero's head without his consent.\n\"Owww!!\" yelped Nero in a complaint before groveling down on the floor.\n\"What are you doing!? …OW!\"\nMonica fired a second shot mercilessly to silence Nero while kneeling before Felix.\nAaaaaaaaah! I'm sorry, I'm sorry if Nero is being rude to you. I'm sorryyyyyy!\nAs Monica rubbed her forehead against the floor in trembling, she heard a small murmur.\n\"…a no-chant spell…\"\nFelix's voice sounded quivering, but it also contained some revere in it.\nHer gaze behind the hood glanced toward the voice… and she saw Felix in his gleamed eyes as if he was moved beyond words.\n\"Please raise your head, Lady Everett.\"\nWhile forcefully swallowing the almost out of her stiffened voice, Monica raised her head just high enough not to be seen under the hood.\nFelix kneeled down in front of Monica and whispered the words that only she could hear.\n\"I knew it, you're the person who saved Cyril from the outburst… and also saved me from the [Conch Flame].\"\n\"——!?\"\nHow did Felix know about [Conch Flame]? The only person who was aware of that incident was Louis, Monica, and the involved person, Casey.\nFelix took one of Monica's shaking hands in his and kissed the back of her hand.\n\"It's a pleasure to meet you, Lady Everett.\"\nFelix's cheeks flushed rosy as he looked at the Silent Witch, his blue eyes somehow enraptured as if he were… a young man in love.\nHer current situation reminded Monica of the man called Eig in the entertainment district who had praised the Silent Witch.\n——\n\"Please forgive my behavior. To tell you the truth, I’m actually a big fan of Silent Witch. When it comes to her, I can’t help but be rather talkative.\"\nO-Oh. N-Now I remember, so he was telling me the truth!\nIt was a bit of shock for Monica when she heard that statement in the Porter Antiquarian Bookstore, though it was only from a stranger's perspective.\nHowever, when she was confronted with the reality of the situation, sweat began to trickle down Monica's palms.\nAs Monica's face stiffened under her hood, Eliane raised her voice somewhat agitatedly.\n\"Peter! Peter! His highnesses and his entourage had just arrived, please prepare some tea for them first!\"\n\"Yes, my lady.\"\nPeter responded promptly to his lady's order and urged the group to the parlor.\nWhen Monica was released from Felix's hands, she held her fast-rising heart above by pulling her robe down. What should I do, I feel like I'm going to throw up from nervousness.\nAs she killed her voice while letting out a ragged breath, Felix smiled as if he'd been enraptured at Monica.\n\"Now, we should be on our way too, Lady Everett.\"\nIf it were possible, she would have preferred to stay here, but Monica was Felix's bodyguard. And if the royal family urged her to join them, she could not afford to disregard their request.\nSo Monica followed the group to the parlor as she hugged her cane to her chest and hunching over with a downcast expression.\n…at this time, she forgot that Nero was sprawled out on the floor, completely oblivious to what was going on.",

      "content": "At the time his master assigned this mission to him, Glenn had raised one question.\n\"Master, what kind of person Silent Witch is?\"\nIn response to Glenn's question, Louis' monocle slipped off before he adjusted it again with a look of utter dismay.\n\"Before we start, let me ask you, how many of the Seven Sages do you know?\"\n\"Well, including Master, I had heard about the Star Oracle Witch, the Artillery Magician, and… who else is left?\"\nIt was less than half of the total.\nLouis massaged his creased brow with his slender fingers and sighed out exasperatedly.\n\"I cannot express how lamentable it is that the disciples of the Seven Sages are unable to name all of the Seven Sages. Fine, I guess I should explain more about the Seven Sages to you so that you won't embarrass yourself in front of Duke Rehnberg. Make sure you get it into that empty head of yours.\"\nGlenn responded, \"Yes,\" in reply and straightened up like a well-behaved dog, Louis then raised up one of his slender fingers.\n\"First up… Mary Harvey, you probably know her as the Star Oracle Witch. She is an expert in astrology and also the most senior among the Seven Sages. If I had to describe, she's a lustful woman who eats up any beautiful boy she catches sight of.\"\n\"I am not a pretty boy, so I'm safe, I guess.\"\nGlenn might think his statement was a matter-of-fact manner, while from another perspective, his face was charming enough and quite lovable. If he had been a few years younger, he might have fallen under Mary Harvey's clutches—although Glenn is unaware of it.\nLouis raised up another finger.\n\"Next is Raul Roseburg, the Thorns Witch.\"\n\"Her name sounds manly enough to be called a witch.\"\n\"He's a man, in fact. It could be said, the name of ‘Thorns Witch' is more like a title name to him.\"\nA renowned magician family had passed down its household title to its successor. And Raul Roseburg was the fifth generation of the Thorns Witch.\n\"Raul Roseburg had the biggest mana capacity which can be categorized as monstrous in our kingdom, and yet he had wasted his talent, did nothing with magic but only studying plants. If you make eye contact with him, he'll shove his home-grown plants in your face.\"\n\"I have an aunt in the neighborhood who does that!\"\nIgnoring Glenn's pacifist comment, Louis raised up his third finger.\n\"Third, Ray Allbright the Abyss Shaman. The curses master. If he caught sight of a young woman, he would always ask, ‘are you falling in love with me?'\"\n\"That won't be a problem, I'm not a woman after all.\"\n\"Fourth, Bradford Firestone the Artillery Magician. He loves talking explosion and battle maniac geezer who challenge anyone that make contact with his eyes.\"\n\"…Master, I wonder why I feel you find it more cumbersome the more you explain it.\"\n\"So, did you realize it now?\"\nLouis didn't seem to take offense and raised up his fifth finger.\n\"Fifth, Emanuel Darwin the Jewel Magician. He might be a master of auxiliary magic who had contributed greatly towards the development of magic tools, but he's just a typical scoundrel who's good at currying favor with money-hungry nobles.\"\n\"Wow! I thought you would explain it in a roundabout way, but it was the most elaborate description.\"\n\"Incidentally, he's in the second prince faction and cahoots with Duke Crockford; he also sees me as his enemy. And as my disciple, in case you make eye contact, it's likely he will pick a fight with you.\"\nAmong the Seven Sages, the Jewel Magician was the most influential in noble circles and regarded Louis who was in the first prince faction as his most hated enemy.\nSince Glenn was unfamiliar with politics, the only thing that he knew was that the Second Prince is the student council president.\nWait? Since Master's in the first prince faction, would that make Prez my enemy?\nGlenn's owed him something, so if it's possible, he didn't want to antagonize him.\nAnyone who enjoys eating our meat cannot be a bad person! But, wait… Prez knew that I was Barrier Magician's disciple… Is he perhaps thinks me as his enemy?\nThat would make him sad if he thinks that way. Glenn was close with Student Council President, and he also didn't make fun of him. Moreover, they surprisingly clicked very well.\nWhile Glenn mulling over this matter as he crossed his arms, Louis raised up his sixth finger.\n\"The sixth person and also the youngest Seven Sage, Monica Everett the Silent Witch.\"\n\"I have a friend who's got the same name as her.\"\n\"You could find that name everywhere. So it must be a coincidence.\"\nWell, a person named ‘Monica' may be everywhere, Glenn thought as he convinced. Since she's got the same name as his friend, it might be easier for him to remember.\n\"Miss Silent Witch had elected to the Seven Sage at the same time as I did, so you could consider her as my colleague. And in our current magic world, she was the only person who could use the no-chant spell.\"\n\"Now I remember! She was the person who had beaten you into a pulp at the Seven Sages selection—\"\nLouis gave Glenn a kick on his shin as his smile shine beautifully. How childish.\nLouis continued his words in composed to Glenn's bitter expression.\n\"To describe the Silent Witch, she was extremely shy at strangers, with interpersonal skills at the bottom of the heap. She even had carried a stupid legend who passed the Seven Sage's interview fainted after her nervousness got her to hyperventilate. She was so fragile that if you make eye contact with her, she will faint instantly with her eyes rolled back… Ahem, she's a very delicate person, you see, so you better don't try to look at her face or ask her many questions.\"\nWhile nodding in understanding, Glenn sorted all the information in his way.\nBarrier Magician: Master. So scary when angry.\nStar Oracle Witch: Great at divination. Once make eye contact, she will eat you. (Limited to handsome boys)\nThord Witch: She is a he. Once make eye contact, he'll pester you about his plants.\nAbyss Shaman: The cursing person. Once make eye contact with him, he will ask you ‘are you falling in love with me?'\nArtillery Magician: A person who likes shouting ‘boom, boom,' Once make eye contact with him, he will pressure you to have a duel.\nJewel Magician: Was bad terms with Master. Once make eye contact with him, he will try to pick a fight with you. (Limited to Glenn)\nSilent Witch: A person who had beaten Master into a pulp. Once make eye contact with her, she will collapse with her eyes rolling back.\nAfter sorting all this information, Glenn realized something.\n\"Master, if all you said were true, then I can't make eye contact with half of these people.\"\nEspecially the latter three.\nProud at his disciple realization, Louis raised his chin smugly.\n\"Now do you understand how capable your master is? With this, you should respect your master more.\"\n\"Master, Mrs. Rosalie said that it is not good to raise your own reputation by putting others down.\"\nHearing his disciple mention his wife's name, Louis kept his smile and kicked his shin twice. Right, twice.\nLouis cleared his throat after looking at his grieving disciple, then continued with his words.\n\"That's all about the Seven Sages. Now, let me hear your opinion.\"\nSo, while rubbing his pain on his shin, Glenn spoke out his honest opinion.\n\"I think all the Seven Sages are eccentric people!\"\n\"Of course, you don't include me in, right, you stupid disciple?\"\nLooking at his master cupping his right fist, Glenn immediately shook in desperately.\nHis fist was so tough to even make him wonder if his fist was made of steel. He even felt being tossed off with a wind spell was still better than receiving his fist.\nSo he hurriedly changed the subject.\n\"Ummm, t-that's right! Master, who is the strongest among the Seven Sages? Is it you, Master, I assume?\"\nHearing his disciple changing the subject with a question, Louis dropped his cupped hand and showed a mixed expression.\n\"Of course, it is… or so is what I wanted to say, but it depends on the circumstances.\"\nHis master who was always confident and got high pride was making an evasive answer.\nLouis Miller the Barrier Magician is a combat magician who boasted second place in the number of the dragons he had slain singlehandedly since the founding of the Ridill Kingdom. (As for the number one, it's the retiring Graham Thunders the Thunder Magician)\nEven without the favoritism of his students, as far as Glenn knows, there are not many people who can compete with Louis in magic combat.\nBut Louis placed fingers on his chin and opened his mouth with a difficult look.\n\"It depends on the circumstances and their current strength and weakness at that time. Among the Seven Sages, there are three combat-oriented magicians: the Artillery Magician, Silent Witch, and myself. If we talk about firepower alone, that Artillery Magician, who got the largest mana capacity among the three and has the ability to enhance his firepower sixfold with his magic formation, was come at the top.\"\nThe firepower they're talking about was used to fight the dragons, so it really mattered. And half-assed magic that can't injure the dragon can only make it stop its track for a while.\nSo, Artillery Magician was a rare magician specializing in offensive magic who can injure a dragon without aiming at its weakness which is on its brow.\n\"On the other hand, Silent Witch, she specializes in the speed casting and precision of her magic. While I can cast one spell with a shortened chant, she can cast two large-scale spells at the same time. Moreover, along with her extremely accurate aim.\"\nThe most common weakness of a magician is the time they chant to cast a spell. Even a few seconds can be a decisive life or death situation. No matter how strong your spell is, it would be useless if you can't use it.\nBut, for Silent Witch, one second is enough for her to cast a spell. The moment the battle has begun, she can break her opponent's neck instantly.\n*shudder* I can't imagine I can come up with victory if I fight her…\nAfter hearing his master's explanation, Glenn pondered. Then thought, how does his master, the Barrier Magician fight?\n\"Master, can you win against the two if you fight them?\"\n\"Like as I said before, it depends on the circumstances. Artillery Magician has the highest offensive power but is weak at defense. Especially when if he wants to raise his offensive power, it would take him more time to cast. While Silent Witch, despite the lack of experience in battle, no one can beat her in the casting speed, even then, because of her extreme lack of physical, she can't use a fight spell.\"\nI see, so Glenn nodded convincingly.\nLouis Miller the Barrier Magician has a high level in both offensive and defensive magic, on top of that, he's able to use them with great dexterity. What's more, with his great physical and bright mind, he can use either his head or fist to fight his opponents.\nIt can be said that the Artillery Magician specialized in offensive power, the Silent Witch specialized in speed and accuracy, while the Barrier Magician is a balanced type.\n\"In other words, Master is a jack of all trades but master of none—owowowowo!\"\nLouis gripped his disciple face with his right hand and his slender fingers were pressured onto his skull before he continued his words.\n\"The Silent Witch would come up as the best if we fight bound by the rules. And I was lost by it last time, though. If in the battlefield where rules were no longer in effect, I can win against her. I can beat a pushover like her with a little effort.\"\nThe magic battle is a duel held in a specialized place within a barrier.\nWithin this barrier, damage can only be inflicted by magic, and even if you take damage, it won't affect your body, but your mana will be declined by the amount of damage you take.\nSince they can practice actual combat safely with that method, the Magician Training Institute Minerva and Magician Troops often held magic combat to train their magicians.\nAnd in the election of the Seven Sages, they also organized magic combat for examination. In which, Louis was suffering a complete defeat which still haunted even until now.\n\"In summary, you're good at dirty battle… owowowow!!\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nRemembering the talk and the pain of the iron claw of his master, Glenn stared at the Silent Witch who sat in the carriage before him.\nThe small girl dressed in a loose robe sat hugging her staff so tightly onto the body. A person who looks at her at glance would surely think that she's a kid pretending to be a magician.\nHmm, I really can't imagine her as a person who had beaten master into a pulp.\nAfter arriving and greeting the people at Duke Rehnberg Household, the servants guided the group into a large room before attending the dinner party.\nIf possible, Glenn wanted to explore this huge mansion, but since the servants had informed him to stay here, he couldn't possibly wander around without permission. Especially when Glenn was Felix's guard right now.\nScanning through furniture, wallpaper, and the curtain inside the mansion, everything looked so expensive, while its glaring of numerous patterns and ornaments all over the place only left prickling to his eyes instead, and it's his true thought.\nEliane has retreated to her room to change her clothes, leaving the room only four people of Glenn, Felix, the Silent Witch, and a self-professed attendant who called himself Bartholomew.\nAnd for an attendant, he looked so fishy.\nThough he professed himself as the Silent Witch's attendant, his attitude was more overbearing than his master, and the name itself implied more be more of an alias. And currently, he was sitting leisurely on the couch with a big yawn on his face.\nGlenn's master had chided him to not ask the Silent Witch many questions, but in his boredom, he tried to approach her to chat.\n\"Lady Silent Witch, I heard you had beaten my master into a pulp a long time ago, is that rumor true?\"\nThe Silent Witch jolted before squeezing her trembling body close to the man in attendant clothes and tugged his sleeve. Maybe she wanted him to speak in her stead.\nBut, the man only answered with ‘I don't know.' after letting a bored yawn.\n\"I didn't know what has happened at that time. Well, no matter who the opponents my master is against, she can easily defeat them, isn't that right, master?\"\nThe Silent Witch hurriedly shook her head in response, but the attendant didn't seem to follow her desperate.\nIn the midst of all this, Felix, who had been silent and reserved until now, opened his mouth.\n\"That's a good question, Dudley. It's truly a pity I didn't present during the Seven Sages selection two years ago, but from what I read in the report afterward, Lady Everett had cast a large scope spell to force the other candidate at bay, without letting them close by. I heard the spell she cast after combining magic formation of remote spell and low-cost spell without chant had truly impressed the other Seven Sages. And the moment she activated the great and large scale area spell, which followed by a low-cost spell she had cast in no time, I instantly understand, what kind outcome her battle against Barrier Magician would end up.\"\nIs it only his feeling or did Felix speak rapidly right now?\nEven Glenn who was studied magic could only understand half of what Felix had said.\n\"Well, I might have understood some of it, but I feel it's really cool!\"\nSmiling in response, Felix then continued fluently.\n\"Speaking of Lady Everett greatness, have you heard about a Low-Cost Magic Formation, which greatly reduces the consumption of mana usage in spell but has very long chants to cast? While at the basic level it would normally require around 30 minutes to chant, at the advanced level it will need up to a few hours, in which case, it makes it not suitable for actual combat. But she had cast such a magic formation without chant. Even for a layman in magic, they would understand the greatness of that stunt. Even her mana capacity was not great, she can cast a big scale magic formation. Which resulted in the defeat of Barrier Magician.\"\nGlenn can't follow Felix's talk at all.\nBut he honestly thought, ‘he really earnest in his study' and spoke.\n\"You seem very knowledgeable about the Silent Witch, Prez.\"\nIn response to the amazed Glenn, Felix showed his perfect smile without blemish before answering.\n\"It's only natural for a member of the royal family.\"\n\"So it's because of a member of the royal family!\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nI swear it doesn't have anything being a member of the royal family!!\nSitting on the couch while curling herself, Monica panicked agape.\nEver since the servants had guided the group to this room, the Silent Witch could sense that Felix has been trying to approach her to talk.\nOnce Felix opened his mouth, his eyes sparkling, with his tongue running more smooth than usual, it was like he had nothing to hide anymore. Though Glenn didn't find it strange.\nFelix's passion for the Silent Witch was genuine. At first, she still had some doubt about it, but after looking at his talk now she was certain. He even remembered the battle record two years ago with every detail, it was no longer a passion of admiring person.\nEvery time Felix talks about the Silent Witch in detail, Glenn would respond with ‘as expected of a royal family!' though only people like Glenn can be convinced with that reason.\n\"Hoo, though I can't follow all your words, I think royal families are quite impressive.\"\nCorrection. it convinced people like Glenn and Nero, yes.\nWell… Nero doesn't know what His Highness thinks about the Silent Witch…\nIn other words, the only person who knew that Felix admires the Silent Which was only Monica.\nWhile Monica continued to listen to Felix talking about the Silent Witch, the realization had only made her stomach hurt even more.",

      "content": "Today, the kitchen in the Duke Rehnberg Household was extremely hectic. Not only was the daughter who had been attending a distant school returning home today, but the royal family was also staying here. And it was only the warm-up before the envoy who will be visiting by tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. Since the employees had to serve the guest the lavish dishes every day.\nThe atmosphere in the kitchen after the end of the first-night banquet was like having finished the arduous battle on the first day. Of course, there are still jobs to be done like cleaning up the party and making preparation for the next day.\n\"Lord Felix seemed to be pleased with the today night banquet. Please keep up the good work tomorrow.\"\nPeter, the servant who served the meal, announced those words after arriving in the kitchen, and all the chefs showed a relieved expression as they pat their chest. He then added in a plain tone to the latter.\n\"Also, Lady Eliane wants you to prepare some drink for His Highness Felix.\"\n\"His Highness? Should we brought the wine with the highest quality?\"\nPeter shook his head at the chef's words and spoke to him with an expression like a faithful loyal servant.\n\"Prepare the ‘Third Secret'.\"\nA shocked expression appeared on the servants.\nThe Third Secret… it's a special drink made by mixing extracted fruits with strong liquor and aphrodisiac spices. It's a drink for a special occasion when the Duchess wants to invite his husband to spend the night.\n\"Our Young Lady has finally…\"\n\"I see… Lady Eliane was…\"\nEach of the servants looked deeply moved as they prepared a special drink for their lovely young lady.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nIn ceremonies and other formal occasions, the participants were not allowed to wear hats and other headgear except for the three things.\nThese were the crown of the king, the holy cap of the priest, and the hooded robe of the magician.\nIn the past, magic was a skill that was monopolized only by royalty and nobility, and both royalty and nobility wanted to keep the existence of magicians a secret. Therefore, until a long time ago, hiding their faces had become a formal attire for magicians.\nNowadays, its custom has become obsolete and many magicians tended to reveal their faces on formal occasions. But, many still regard that hiding their faces in the hooded robe is the true formal attire for magicians. This was also the reason Monica can hide her face at the ceremony.\nBut, even she wants to, it would look abnormal if she kept hiding her face at the banquet.\nSo Monica could only decline people's invitation to join and kept firmly standing on guard.\nEven after Felix had invited her to eat together or Glenn volunteered to take turns on guard, Monica still stubbornly declined. And during the banquet, she kept standing on the edge near the wall alongside Nero.\n\"I-I'm worn out… my stomach… my stomach's rumbling… ugh…\"\nAfter returning back to her room, Monica flopped onto her bed, while Nero spread open the night snacks like bread and cheese which he had received on the table.\n\"It's just the first day, you know. If you were already this exhausted, how you can hold this from now on?\"\nNero bit some cheese and said ‘oh! this cheese tastes good!' in a good mood. Goodness, whose fault do you think it is that I'm this tired? Looking back, half the cause was Nero's conduct manner.\nMonica rolled on the bed, laying her body facing the ceiling before looking at Nero bitterly.\n\"Nero, I didn't know you have met His Highness before.\"\n\"It's not important anyway. I only chatted with him for a while when I met him while delivering the Chilly Guy.\"\n\"…just to make sure, he hasn't discovered my true identity, has he?\"\n\"Of course! He also used a lizard to probe my identity, but I caught it with my fingers.\"\n\"…a lizard?\"\nWhat did he mean by a lizard?\nWhile Monica had some doubt, Nero put a slice of meat and chees between the bread and gnawed it before continuing to her.\n\"Hah hihahd has waher shirit ghay.\"\n\"…Nero, swallow your food before talking.\"\nWhile Monica expressing her exasperation, a knock suddenly came from the door.\nWondering who's coming at this hour.\n\"Lady Everett. I'm sorry for interrupting your rest at this hour. May I have your time for a while?\"\nThe sound coming behind the door was Felix's voice.\nPanicked, Monica turned her gaze to Nero. The latter gulped his food and returned her gaze.\n\"What do you want? Want me to shoo him away?\"\n\"I can't turn him away. At the very least… please keep your manner in check so as not to be rude to him.\"\nReplying to her with ‘alright, alright' in a sloppy tone, Nero opened the door after checking Monica has put her hood on.\nContrary to the expectation, Felix standing in the hallway was not in his nightwear, but in his usual clothes with fewer ornaments, hanging a big basket in his arm.\nFelix was a bit surprised after he found the one who opened the door was Nero.\n\"Are you staying together with Lady, Mr. Alexander?\"\n\"Of course. I'm her attendant. More importantly, what do you want for visiting her at this hour?\"\nLooking at Nero raised his chin threateningly, Felix held out his basket hanging in his hand.\nBottles of drinks, a small enamel pot, and a fruitcake were contained in it.\n\"I haven't seen Lady Everett join the banquet activity and saw her eat anything afterward, so I asked the servants in the kitchen to make some night snack for her.\"\nNero's eyes sparkled instantly.\n\"What a good guy are you. Come in.\"\nNero replied without asking for Monica's consent. Since the girl herself didn't plan to drive her guest away, Monica had prepared a chair for Felix while at it.\nAfter thanking her for the gesture and sitting on the chair, Felix's eyes widened after looking at the bread unfolded on the table.\n\"Oh, you had your night snack already? I guess I've done unnecessary things.\"\n\"You came at the right time, the meat and cheese were not enough for my fill. What is inside the jar?\"\n\"They told me it was extracted fruits juice.\"\nWithout waiting for Felix's answer, Nero opened the lid of the bottle and directly gulped down the contents into his mouth.\n\"This is good. I can taste some spices mixed in. I suppose it's some spices meant for adults. The sense of a hot feeling rising inside my gut felt so good.\"\n\"I heard there's no alcoholic content mixed in, only extracted fruits juice though…\"\nTilting in puzzled, Felix opened the lid of the pot. Inside, the hot soup with mist billowing out.\n\"Lady Everett, how about having some warm soup?\"\nAfter pondering for a while, Monica nodded.\nHer stomach was already rumbling, and she didn't know if she can finish her bread up, maybe she could at least manage to drink some soup.\nThe soup was made by simmering root vegetables, grinding them, and mixing them with milk to make the soup thicker. One sip of the soup had brought her a sense of relief from the gentle sweetness of the vegetables.\nWhile Monica was huffing and puffing as she sipped her soup, Nero was gobbling up his fruitcake and his eyes were sparkling.\n\"What the hell is this? This is so good. The taste of alcohol is superb.\"\n\"The alcohol is made from fruit soaked in its region's famous distillate. By the way, what is your relationship with Lady Everett?\"\nNero clutched a fruitcake in both hands and answered with a mouthful of food.\n\"Her attendant.\"\n\"Your appearance had suggested you more like her parent than her disciple. Are you perhaps her relative… or her lover?\"\nMonica couldn't help but sput out her soup.\nTrembling as he covered her mouth with her hand, Nero was laughing heartily in response.\n\"No way! She's not my type anyway.\"\nAfter all, Nero prefers ‘females with a sexy tail.'\nBut Felix seemed not convinced with Nero's answer. Logically, if a man and woman were staying together in one room, either both of them was a lover or family.\n\"You know, I was her familiar… no, what is again? Um…\"\nAfter searching for the right word to replace the ‘familiar, Nero hit his palm with a cupped hand.\n\"Right! I'm her lowly servant!\"\nMonica pulled down the edge of her hood and shook her head desperately.\nFelix expressed his troubled face, looking alternately at Monica and Nero.\n\"…her lowly servant, huh?\"\n\"That's right! She's saved my life. Not long ago, when I'm troubled in agony with a bone of a bird stuck on my throat, she…\"\nMonica hurriedly pulled Nero's hem. Maybe Nero also realized that he's speaking too much, so he cut his words and stuffed another fruitcake into his mouth. After gulping the last cake, his golden eyes glared at Felix.\n\"That was dangerous. I almost fell to your ‘bait question'.\"\n\"I'm not guiding you into a bait question, I'm just asking honestly.\"\n\"So you just honestly want to know about me, huh.\"\nRather than Nero himself, Felix actually wanted to know more about the Silent Witch.\nAnswering him with a wry smile, Felix took out a bundle of paper from the bottom of the basket.\n\"I have personal questions I want to discuss with Lady Everett. If you may, could you take a look at this?\"\nNervously reaching out her hand, she then took the bundle of paper with her hand.\nShe really wondered what's written in the paper. Is he perhaps wants some advice from her related to the trade with the neighboring countries? Or maybe he wants to propose some arrangements regarding the escort?\nIf it was, she didn't have the confidence to be able to answer these questions properly. While the thought made her anxious, she gave a cursory look, then… her eyes widened under her hood.\nIs this a magic formation?\nWhat's written there was a detailed description of a certain magic formation and its application.\nIt was a magic formation that Monica was familiar with. After all, it was none other than a new magic formation that Monica had developed herself.\nMonica raised her face a little and saw Felix smile with a bashful expression.\n\"To tell you the truth, I have a friend who admires you so much… I made a promise with him that if I meet you, Lady Everett, I will bring this writtings and ask her to review it…\"\nS-Surely… the friend he's speaking of is referring to that ‘Eig'\nIn other words, he's referring to himself.\nThough he said it was about his friend… the person he's talking about was none other than himself. And the way he spoke sounded like that way.\nPutting his hands on his knees, Felix looked at Monica with apparent anticipation. Since she can't disregard his request, she decided to give the reports a cursory look.\nThis is… incredible. He's done it very well.\nThough there were some noticeable flaws that need correction, the rest was written exceptionally.\nIf His Highness really thought this concept himself… his knowledge might have reached the Minerva upperclassmen students…\nBut, Monica knew that Felix's grandfather had prohibited him from studying magics.\nAnd she also knew he was not allowed to own any practical book, so he secretly collected writing papers published by Minerva's student.\nEven with such limitations, he was able to come up with these writings.\nHe… He truly loves magic so much.\nSuch a person had been seriously thinking about the possibility of applying magic she had devised, and Monica's pride as a magician was touched with that thought. To put it frankly, it made Monica happy.\n\"………\"\nMoving to her writing-table, Monica took out her inkwell and quill before scribbling some words to review his writings.\nAs a magician, Monica wanted to respond to his passion for magic honestly.\nEven if the other party was the second prince of this country, Monica will not compromise on the math formula and magic formation.\nShe altered the letters a little so that her handwriting would not give away her true identity, pointing out the mistakes and areas that were not taken enough into consideration. After that, Monica wrote down the words in the blank space of the writings as follows:\n‘These writings were quite intriguing. I believe it could be improved even more if the problems I pointed out are corrected and the lack of data on the amount of mana flow increases.'\nAfter writing all her thought, Monica returned to her sense.\nW-Wouldn't this make me sound really rude? Uwaaaaa, who do you think are you, Monica? I-I-I-I guess I should revise my review more pleasingly?\nWhile that thought running inside Monica's mind, she heard a gulping sound right behind her.\nTurning her gaze back, Monica saw Felix standing behind her, looking the written reviews over her shoulder.\nAaaaaaaahhhh! I will be executed… I will be executed for lese majeste.\nMonica panicked under her hood, but Felix didn't look displeased, rather he's more impressed than ever, squeezing the chest of his clothes. Following by sitting beside Monica, he reached out her hand as if he wants to propose marriage to her, then spoke.\n\"Lady Everett… I'm really honored to be able to receive such great praises from you.\"\nNero, who looked disinterested up until now, suddenly cut the conversation.\n\"Isn't it about your friend?\"\n\"Y-Yes, I'm sure my friend will also feel that way.\"\nFelix smoothly added and held the bundle of writings that Monica had reviewed in his chest as if it were a treasure.\n\"Thank you very much, Lady Everett… I'm sure my friend would be delighted to hear it.\"\n\"………\"\nAs Monica felt a slightly mixed feeling inside, she took back a piece of the reports from Felix's hand and wrote something on its back.\n‘I'm looking forward to seeing your writings again.'\nThe look of joy on Felix's face when he saw that was almost impossible to hide!\nPerhaps her comment was unnecessary if she wanted to hide her true identity and continue to perform the escort mission. Nevertheless, the magician Monica Everett felt she should express her honest feeling.\nMuch more so after Felix said this as he stargazing after the school festival was over.\nThat he had to give up and let go of the things he loved.\nStill, I… I didn't want you to let go of the things that you loved.\nSo Monica secretly vowed that she would not destroy his dream, even if his feeling toward the Silent Witch was only an illusion.\nThough Felix said that this feeling might be his first love, what he felt for the Silent Witch was definitely not romantic feelings. It was pure admiration and respect.\nIf that is the case, Monica will continue to maintain her image as the Silent Witch that he admires, and continue to occupy the position of the Seven Sages.\nSo please don't give up…\n…the things ‘you' passionate about.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAfter Eliane Hyatt watched Felix ‘visit' the Silent Witch's room from behind her hiding place, she can't help but grit her teeth.\nOh my, oh my, oh my, what was that? Hey, what had just happened?\nAfter the dinner party, she ordered the servant Peter to prepare the Third Secret, which has been passed down to the women of the Hyatt family for generations.\nUnfortunately, Felix had mistakenly taken the Third Secret with the extracted fruit juice.\nSo Eliane changed her strategy and planned to visit Felix's room under the guise of ‘Traveling has exhausted me so much, but this exciting feeling prevents me from sleeping, so I wondered if we could have a little chat.'\nHowever, when she was imagining Felix's mood after drinking the Third Secret… she saw Felix enter the Silent Witch's room while bringing\nit\ninside.\n\"Huh, isn't that you, Elane? What are you doing here at this hour?\"\nWhile Eliane gritting her teeth, Glenn called out to her in his nightwear. She wondered why this guy always appears in every, single, time at times like this instead of Felix.\n\"Oh my, that should be my line Lord Dudley, what are you doing here at this hour?\"\nGlenn's friendly face tightened as he looked over at Eliane with a serious look on his face.\n\"…Actually, I have something I really need to ask you, Ellie.\"\nOh my, oh my, oh my.\nPerhaps this was a confession of love, she wondered. After all, the winter vacation is the most time where young people cut loose.\nOf course, Eliane was only interested in Felix, so she would refuse such a man's confession in scorn…\n\"To tell you the truth, I need to go to the bathroom, but I'm afraid of the dark, so can I ask you to tag along?\"\n\"………\"\nThus, the memory of Eliane Hyatt's wonderful night ended with her guiding Glenn Dudley to the bathroom.",

      "content": "The envoys from the Falforia Kingdom arrived on schedule, and the diplomatic dealings began after Felix, the second prince of the Ridill Kingdom, greeted the group.\nThe history behind the Falforia Kingdom goes back to when it was originally two separate countries, the Fal Kingdom and the Foria Kingdom.\nIn the beginning, they formed an alliance and were called the Allied Nation of Fal and Foria but later years, it had become the current Kingdom Falforia.\nThe aftermath had caused the descendants of the Kingdom Fal and Kingdom Foria, whether its citizens or its rulers, to compete over with each other, and its internal politics in the kingdom has by no means been stable.\nThis time, the Falforia Kingdom had sent eight envoys. Supervised by two leading diplomats, Count Barrow and Count Marre, they seemed to be at odds with each other in a four-on-four ratio, if you including their subordinates.\nCount Barrow, a descendant of the former Fal Kingdom, had a relatively friendly, or rather respectful attitude toward the Ridill Kingdom, on the other hand, Count Marre, a descendant of the former Foria Kingdom, was reluctant to secure the trade with the Ridill Kingdom.\nAs the former Folia Kingdom was adjacent to the Empire's territory, they had been in cooperative relations with the Empire since the old times. Perhaps Count Marre was inclined to seek influence from the Empire rather than the Ridill Kingdom.\nSo, to make this trade successful, I have to get Count Marre's support.\nFelix casually observed the envoys of the neighboring countries as he read the diplomatic materials.\nThe plump Count Barrow has been flattering Felix in a very obvious way since a while ago. He's probably wanted to strengthen the alliance with the Ridill Kingdom.\nOn the other hand, the slender Count Marre looked dismissive and hardly looked Felix in the face since he arrived here.\nHowever, Felix deliberately turned to Count Marre and smiled at him.\n\"I have to say that the wines of the Falforia Kingdom are something else. I also tasted the new Perle d'Ande the other day, and it was especially good this year.\"\nFelix brought up the subject of wine instead of wheat which was his main interest and it made Count Marre look at him warily and his narrow eyes narrow even more.\n\"…indeed, that wine made from the finest grapes was our kingdom's specialty. Or perhaps, you're looking for the bread that goes with it instead of the wine itself, I believe.\"\nAs Count Marre said, his goal this time was to see how he could increase the amount of wheat imported from Falforia.\nAlthough Count Barrow was eager to approach the Ridill Kingdom, Count Marre was blatantly opposed to the idea.\n\"I heard that your kingdom was planning to establish a new garrison of the dragon knights in the Duchy of Rehnberg.\"\nFelix had expected Count Marre would reproach him with this topic, he smiled inwardly.\nThe eastern region of the Ridill Kingdom is particularly prone to dragon damage. Consequently, dispatching dragon knights from the royal capital would take a long time to arrive, and this had been viewed as a problem for many years.\nThus, establishing a garrison in the southeastern part of the Ridill Kingdom to station the dragon knights… or that should be.\nHowever, the other countries viewed the establishment of the new garrison with a slightly different meaning.\nThe dragon knights, as the name implies, are an army of knights proficient in fighting dragons, but they do not always fight only against dragons. When war breaks out, they will naturally direct their blades to the opposing countries.\nAnd the Ridill Kingdom was planning to establish a garrison to house the dragon knights in the Duchy of Rehnberg, a territory close to both the Empire and the Falforia Kingdom.\nFrom the side of the Empire and the Falforia Kingdom, this could be seen as a deterrent. Furthermore, Count Marre is a staunch supporter of the Empire. There's no way he could overlook the construction of the garrison.\n…Well, considering the current situation, Count Marre's concerns are justified.\nThe idea behind this garrison project came from Felix's grandfather, Duke Crockford.\nAnd Duke Crockford has his eyes set on the Empire, and a war would break out sooner or later.\n…most likely, he's probably planning to use the dragon knight military post as a supply base if he wants to strike the Empire.\nDuke Crockford has been trying to strengthen his military power in the eastern part of the country under the guise of preventing dragon damage.\nAs Count Marre had apparently seen through Duke Crockford's intention, he opened his mouth cautiously, playing with his mustache.\n\"Indeed, I believe building a new garrison would need a lot of provisions. It's better to have more wheat and wine in stock.\"\nFelix's agreed with his statement, that's why he needed to increase the number of imports from Falforia with this deal.\nMoreover, the Duchy of Rehnberg is relatively close to the Falforia Kingdom, which makes it easy to bring imported food to the newly established garrison—in other words, transportation costs can be greatly reduced.\n\"But is there really a necessity to build a new garrison? Pardon me for saying so, but hasn't your country done enough to deal with dragon damage in the past?\"\n\"Thanks to the cooperation of regional lords, it ended up well. But it had caused more burdens in some territory… and to lessen their burden the establishment of a new garrison has become necessary.\"\nFelix replied promptly, but Count Marre didn't seem to catch the meaning.\nAs if to follow up on Count Marre's words, Count Barrow, also of the Falforia Kingdom, spoke up in a forward manner.\n\"Please pardon me for meddling in the affairs of another country, Your Highness Felix. I think Count Marre didn't quite understand the danger of dragon damage. After all his territory is within the former Foria Kingdom… an area that is relatively safe from dragon damage.\"\n\"Hmph, disposable mercenaries should be enough to deal with dragon damage.\"\nFelix smiled bitterly inside as he listened to Count Barrow and Count Marais bickering amongst themselves.\nThe topic that should have focused on the wheat imports had shifted to the garrison and dragon damage.\nHe had to rethink the situation once again. After that, he needed to figure out a way to persuade Count Marre.\nFelix looked sideways at his guards, the Silent Witch standing by the wall, and muttered in his heart.\n…I'd like to show off my good points in front of Lady Everett if possible.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nIn the room next to where the diplomatic meeting was taking place, Glenn was sitting around a table with Bartholomew Alexander, the attendant of the Silent Witch, playing cards to pass the time.\nThey were stationed in an adjoining room, ready to rush to the scene in case of an emergency, while the real reason was they had nothing to do at the moment.\n\"Here's my completed ‘Water Dragon' cards.\"\n\"Aaaah. I lost agaaaaaiiin.\"\nBartholomew spread his cards out on the table in frustration. Glenn rounded his eyes when he saw the cards in his hand.\n\"Mr. Bartholomew, you were aiming for the ‘Black Dragon' cards again?\"\n‘Black Dragon' was the most difficult and the highest score one could get to aim.\nEach player takes turns drawing cards from the deck to create a hand of seven cards. To achieve the ‘Black Dragon' cards, one requires three cards of a ‘black wings' card, a ‘black scales' card, a ‘black claws' card, and a ‘golden eyes' card along with three ‘mana' cards. And the probability of getting these cards was like getting a royal straight flush in poker.\n\"I don't feel like making a bunch of weak dragons. It's better to aim for the biggest one.\"\n\"It was meaningless if you can't win the game, you know~ Besides, the water dragon is not a weakling at all.\"\n\"It's a weakling, alright. A lower-tier dragon that can't even properly understand communication.\"\nAlthough there are many types of dragons, they can be roughly divided into lower-tier and higher-tier dragons.\nThe most common of the lower-tier dragons are wyvern and herbivorous dragons.\nThe second most common are fire dragons, water dragons, and earth dragons. These three are sometimes classified as mid-tier species in academic circles, but they are basically treated the same as lower-tier species.\nAnd the higher-tier dragons are the red dragon, blue dragon, green dragon, yellow dragon, white dragon, and black dragon—namely, the dragons with colors in their names.\nWhile the scale colors and skeletal frame was similar, its sheer size was two heads bigger and its fighting prowess far exceeded the lower-tier dragons, with the Red Dragons superior to the fire dragons, the Blue Dragons superior to the water dragons, the Green Dragons superior to the wyverns and the Yellow Dragons superior to the earth dragons.\nAnd above all, the higher-tier dragons can understand human language. Even some of them are said to be able to use advanced-level magic.\nIn particular, the White and Black Dragons are special dragons with no inferior equivalents, and their very existence itself is almost legendary. As a result, they gave the highest scores in the game.\n\"Now that I think about it, I heard the higher-tier dragons rarely appear in public, but do they all speak human language?\"\nThe higher-tier dragons possess the same or higher intelligence as humans. As such, they seldom appear in public and rarely attack humans.\nTo Glenn's naive question, Bartholomew answered as he looked at the pattern on the card.\n\"The higher-tier dragons may understand human language, but they don't have the vocal cords to speak it. So, they speak the same language as the spirits. Though most humans can't understand them.\"\n\"Is that so?\"\n\"But if they altered their vocal cords, they could produce a human voice.\"\nHe seemed to be an unruly and unmannerly attendant, but he was surprisingly well versed in various fields.\nAs Glenn was honestly impressed, Bartholomew opened his mouth as he spread out the cards in the deck.\n\"By the way, Loud Boy.\"\n\"I'd prefer if you call me Glenn though.\"\n\"What does this ‘cursed' card implies?\"\nIgnoring Glenn's insistence, Bartholomew drew a card marked ‘cursed' from the deck.\n\"It doesn't matter what kind of dragon series you had completed, but if you get a ‘curse' card in your hand, your dragon series will become ‘cursed dragon'\".\n\"Do the ‘cursed' series give a high score?\"\n\"If you completed this series, you'll get minus 10 points while the rest players will get minus 20 points.\"\nRegardless of whether it's a lower- or higher-tier dragon, a dragon attached with a ‘cursed' card will be called a cursed dragon. A dragon that spread curses around and its existence itself can be called a disaster.\nHowever, since cursed dragons rarely appeared, their rarity was seen as the same as White Dragon and Black Dragon. Even in history, its appearance can be counted with the fingers in one hand.\n\"I see. It's a well-made game. All right, let's do another round.\"\nAs Bartholomew said this and was collecting up the cards, there was a knock at the door and a servant came in.\nIt was Peter, an earnest-looking man in his prime.\n\"Please pardon my intrusion. I would like to request you to accompany our guests in the next room, as they will be going hunting soon.\"\n\"Hunting, do they do that around here?\"\n\"Yes, it will be held in the forest nearby within a short distance ride on a horse. I also have prepared horses for you.\"\nAt these words, Glenn and Bartholomew looked at each other.\n\"Hey, Loud Boy, can you ride a horse?\"\n\"I've never ridden a horse before.\"\n‘Handling its meat was,' added the son of butchery in a faint voice, but it made Peter and Bartholomew startled.\nAnd in some areas in the Ridill Kingdom, there are some customs of eating horse meats. They treated its meats like cutlets.",

      "content": "Monica was riding atop a horse and at lost at the moment.\n\"Lady Everett, please held in tight onto me,\" said Felix sitting in front of her with an excellent posture. Maybe because he used to ride a horse, the figure of him holding the rein looked elegant. And Monica was sitting closely behind him with her legs to the side.\nNegotiations with the Falforia Kingdom seemed to have hit a stalemate, but both sides had mutually accepted that it would not be over in a day. To deepen their friendship, Felix had arranged a hunting game today. However, a fatal problem was discovered when they were about to move to the hunting grounds. Monica, Nero, and Glenn—the three people who were supposed to guard the guests—had no experience in riding horses. Though Glenn can use a flight spell to follow them, he can't be flying around continuously during the hunt. After all, maintaining a flight spell uses a huge amount of mana. (In Lynn's case, she can maintain a flight spell for a long time because she's a spirit.)\nGlenn was relatively athletic, but it was hardly possible for him to keep up with Felix and the others who were used to riding. As for the non-human Nero, his presence only make the other animals scared in trembling, so it's impossible for him to ride a horse.\nAfter some discussion, it was decided that Monica would sit together with Felix in the back. Two adults might be too heavy, but her small body should not add much burden to the horse. As for Nero and Glenn, they used a carriage to reach the hunting ground and were ordered to stand by in the rest area during the hunt.\nThis time, the duchess and her daughter also tagged along in the hunting game. They were there not to participate in the hunt, but rather to enjoy a chat over a light meal. You could say it was a picnic. Together with Nero and Glenn, the picnic group would also stay there in the rest area.\nI-I would be rather in the picnic grooooup!\nFor Monica who had no experience in equestrian, riding a horse was too stimulating for her feeble heart. To put it bluntly, she was just too scared. Even a little sway had already made Monica terrified of falling.\nWhat's more, sitting close by near Felix was bad for her heart. Every time the horse swayed, Monica panicked, afraid that the hood would come off. Each time it happened, Monica desperately clung to him in close eyes, until Felix shifted his gaze back to look at her.\n\"Are you scared?\"\n\"………\"\nShe honestly wanted to nod at his question, but ever since she had vowed to herself last night, she wanted to keep the image of respectable Silent Witch in front of Felix. Not to mention her role as his guard, it would be unbecoming for her if she was scared of riding a horse. So she kept her silent without acknowledging nor denying it and Felix reined his horse to stop in response.\n\"Pardon me.\"\n\"—!?\"\nFelix grabbed her waist to lift Monica who's desperately killing her voice while pulling over her hood down before placing her in the front seat before him.\nIn equestrian, it's common to assign a woman to sit behind the man if they ride a horse together. Otherwise, it only makes it hard for the man to rein the horse.\nEspecially during the hunt. It will only trouble him if Monica sat in the front.\n\"Mm—! Mmm—!?\"\nFelix then pointed at his gun on his shoulder when Monica was flapping her hands in panic.\nI'll only interrupt his hunting if I sat in the front!\n\"You don't have to worry. This riffle was only a prop.\"\n\"?\"\n\"I've been planning to give some credit to the guests since many of Falrorian like to hunt.\"\nApparently, Felix was trying to gain some diplomatic advantage by making the other party feel great by handing over the credit in this hunting game.\nWell, he didn't think Count Marre's opinion would change over something like that, but it would good starting point for elevating his mood.\nI guess diplomacy is a tough job…\nThe main prey in this hunt will be non-hibernated foxes. Hunting a fox can be quite tricky since it can hide in its nest, but the servants had closed its nest's entrance and they brought hunting dogs that keep it at bay, so it can't hide anymore. It only left the guests to hunt the prey they find—which made this hunt like a game.\nCasey probably would frown upon it if she hears about this…\nFor those living in poor areas, hunting is an act to secure valuable foods, but for the wealthy, it's just a sort of game. Even they were bearing the same noble titles, they had held different principles, and Monica felt that she had just glimpsed the hard fact of this country.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"Hey, is hunting a fox really that much fun? Does fox meat taste good?\"\n\"Its meat smells really bad, so it's not suitable to serve as a dish. You still can eat it if you boiled it over a long time and mixed it with many seasonings, but it will not taste like meat.\"\nEliane was annoyed behind her smile as she listened to Glenn explain to Bartholomew about meat, saying its meat tastes better if served in this way or when the best season for preparing the meat.\nWhy can't I be the one who shares the ride with Lord Felix? I know it's inevitable since Lady Silent Witch had a job to guard His Highness, but why doesn't she choose another person to share the ride? Or rather, why do these guys begin talking over the meat instead of protecting Lord Felix? Can't they have more civil topics to discuss with the women like us? And why didn't you say anything, Mother?\nHer mother, Duchess Reinberg covered her mouth with her folded fan when Eliane met her eyes, which then smiled involuntarily.\n\"Oh my, you seem very knowledgeable about meat, Young Dudley.\"\n\"My knowledge came from my parents as a butchery.\"\n\"Well, is that so? Then could you give me some advice on serving rabbit meat? As you can see, my daughter is a picky eater and doesn't eat much.\"\nEliane maintained her graceful smile and screamed inwardly.\nMother!? Why did you just casually join in on their meat discussion!?\nAfter all, the duchess had tried some recipes, to which Glenn nodded earnestly.\n\"When choosing rabbit meat, I advise using female ones, since it's more tender and tasty. Before processing the meat, it's better to age it for about three days, also, it is important to cool the abdomens with snow or ice so it won't leave a bad smell.\"\nThough in the daughter of the duke's perspective, it was unnecessary knowledge.\nGlenn looked unusually wise when explaining meat. His appearance may look reasonably good if only he's not talking about meat.\n\"It may be easier to eat if you turn the rabbit meat into patties before adding more herbs and seasonings. As you already know, rabbit meat tastes best when tender, and turning it into patties would prevent it to lose its juice. It's also delicious if you turn it into a soup! And the secret is to hammer the bone so the broth will come out easily…\"\nIn the first place, Eliane's dislike of rabbit meat came from her childhood, when she witnessed a cook skinning a rabbit. So hearing someone talking about how to prepare meat or how to pound bones to make soup stock was not something Eliane would enjoy.\nEliane stood up quietly and jumped on her horse tied to a tree. Eliane might have not been an expert at horse riding, but she could get on and off the horse by herself or at least go for a quick ride around nearby.\nThe servants had prepared a horse with a saddled for sideways riding for Eliane, even she was wearing a skirt, it wouldn't prevent her from handling it.\n\"Peter. Accompany me on the ride.\"\nWhile Eliane asked the servants to follow her, Glenn shifted his gaze to her in surprise.\n\"Do you need to go to a toilet?\"\nIn which world there's a lady who rides a horse to go to the toilet?\nElaine replied with a smile at his tactless response as her temple twitched.\n\"I wanted to have a little stroll.\"\n\"Then let Bartholomew or me accompany your stroll.\"\n\"It's not necessary. There are no large beasts in this forest and I won't get lost since it's like a garden for me.\"\nPeter, who was pulling the horse, was familiar with this forest and would prove no problem for him to find a way.\nGlenn seemed wanting to say something but was interrupted by Eliane's urging on Peter.\n\"Peter. Let's get going.\"\n\"Understood…\"\nPeter seemed to be perplexed but after considering this forest had little to no danger, he obeyed Eliane's order and made the horse carrying Eliane walk.\nAs Eliane gripped the horse rein in her hands, she let out a sigh while hoping to meet Felix by a chance in the forest.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"Are Eli will be okay?\"\nThe duchess offered Glenn a drink who worriedly said as he kept glancing into the forest before smiling gently at him.\n\"You might find her a bit selfish, but please don't think her badly.\"\n\"I never thought of her as a bad person,\" said Glenn while drinking a warm tea, and the duchess exclaimed an ‘oh my!' inwardly as she smiled gently in response. Her gentleness looked similar to her daughter… or perhaps more than that of her daugher.\nMeanwhile, Bartholomew was gnawing heartily at the bread as a light meal while darting his gaze around.\n\"What's the matter, Bartholomew?\"\n\"I sense something approaching rapidly… I got a weird feeling in its mana.\"\nHis golden eyes shifted around until it stopped in the direction where Eliane advanced toward the forest.\n\"Hey, Loud Boy. You bring back that Fluffy Girl. I feel something ominous approaching.\"\n\"Something ominous?\"\n\"I can't explain it since I've never sensed mana this disgusting… but from its shape and size, I can say it's…\"\nBartholomew's words sounded so vague that it was hard to feel the tension. The other servants looked at Bartholomew in puzzled.\nAmidst this situation, Bartholomew paused to catch his breath, raised his eyebrows then shouted.\n\"…a dragon! …no, wait, something resembling a dragon is approaching here!\"",

      "content": "The Duchy of Rehnberg is situated in the eastern part of the country. It's a place that was prone to dragon damage but compared to other territories, the amount of dragon damage that appeared there was relatively low.\nAt most, a few times a year, some herbivorous dragon strays from the herd and wanders into the human village. Ever since Eliane was born, she only heard of stories of a few large dragons appearing in the past.\nAs far as she is concerned, bears and boars are much more threatening to her than dragons. Since a large beast hardly appeared, this forest had become a perfect place for a stroll. Albeit with a large deer would be coming out occasionally. Generally, a deer could be ferocious in their own way, but since Peter had a hunting rifle, he would be able to drive them away if he encountered one.\nOh, how wonderful it would be if I were to bump into Lord Felix here. He may look a little surprised, but he will soon smile and extend his hand to me, saying, ‘Come here, Eliane.' I will appear confused at first, but when I take his hand… he might pull me in his arms a bit forcefully. Then, while I was embarrassed, he would tell me to hold on tight or I would be in danger, and I would nervously reach for Lord Felix's chest…\nAs Eliane was entranced by the pleasant fantasy, her horse abruptly stopped.\n\"Hm? What's the matter?\"\n\"I don't know. The horse suddenly started getting frightened…\"\nPeter examined the horse, but it didn't seem to be injured anywhere. It was just clearly flustered and scared of something.\nJudging that there might be a large beast nearby, Peter held up his hunting rifle just in case.\nHowever, he sensed the forest felt so quiet and didn't hear any distinctive sound of large animals scurrying through the grass.\nThen a sudden gust of wind blew and swayed the hem of Eliane's skirt. She felt slightly chilly followed by fading sunlight. Maybe the clouds obstructed the light, so Eliane tilted her head up… and gasped.\n\"…huh?\"\nIt was not the clouds, but something large circling above the trees was blocking the sunlight. Looking at the sight of the huge silhouette made Eliane's back cold.\n\"…a dragon.\"\nThe first thing that comes to mind when thinking about dragons that are good at flying is wyverns. In terms of size, a wyvern is roughly has the same size as a cow.\nBut the dragon above her head was about twice that size. Its thick, hard-looking scales were vibrant fresh green in color.\n\"A Green Dragon… A higher-tier…\"\nAt Eliane's murmur, Peter also looked up. Despite his paleness, he tried to rein in the horse doing his duty as a servant. However, the frightened horse refused to move an inch. On the contrary, it seemed as if it would be rampaging if he provoked it too much.\n\"Lady Eliane, I think you should get off the horse.\"\n\"B-But it would be better if we ride a horse…\"\n\"Horses that encounter a dragon have a high probability of losing control! It will be thrown you off if you ride on it with the saddle sideways!\"\nEliane hurriedly let go of the reins, held her skirt, and tried to get off her horse… At the same time, the dragon above her head cried out in a high-pitched roar.\nThe horse, frightened by the dragon's cry, neighed and lifted its front legs high. When Eliane lost her balance and fell off the horse, Peter pulled Eliane's hand and opened the distance to prevent the horse from kicking her.\nAt that moment, a particularly strong wind blew. The Green Dragon came hurtling down toward them. As Peter and Eliane hurried to hide behind a tree, the dragon's sharp claws buried into the body of the rampaging horse.\nThe dragon's claws crushed the horse's body along with its sturdy saddle. Eliane quickly covered her ears and turned away at the sound of the horse's dying cries. Then Peter pulled Eliane's arm strongly.\n\"We should get out of here.\"\n\"H-Hold on. I think we should hide rather than make a careless move…\"\nAnd then they saw that the dragon was not devouring the corpse of the horse but was simply chopping and grinding it up as if it was taking out its anger on it. Its behavior was clearly abnormal.\nUnlike the lower-tier dragons, the higher-tier dragons were intelligent beings. As such, they would not mindlessly attack humans.\nIt made Elaine wonder why did that Green Dragon seem to be so violent?\nEliane had an uncomfortable feeling when looking at its behavior.\nShe saw something shadowy emerging from the green dragon's beautiful fresh green scales. She assumed it was just its silhouette at first, but the shadow was crawling over the green dragon's body like a giant snake. Its appearance was clearly abnormal.\nEliane had never seen a dragon with shadows crawling over its body. But she knew the significance of this because she has heard of it in old stories.\n——That shadow was a ‘curse' that eats away at the dragon.\nA dragon that carries a curse. In other words, the worst existence among the dragon damage, along with the black dragon… a cursed dragon.\nA part of the shadow that had been crawling over the dragon's body emerged like a snake and entangled itself in the corpse of the horse. Then, the whole body of the horse's corpse turned black in a flash. The blackened corpse eventually melted and blended with the snake-like shadow—Eliane intuitively understood. The horse had been \"taken in\" by the curse.\n\"Peter… Peter…\"\n\"Hiiiekk… I-It will eat me… I-It will…\"\nPeter was biting his thumbnail in trembling and pulling his hair with his other hand. He was in a delirious state.\nOnce the adult who could be relied upon panicked, his fear and confusion became contagious and spread to Eliane.\n\"No, no, no, no, I wouldn't die here, no! I don't want to die!\"\nThe shadow that took in the horse slipped back into the body of the Green Dragon. The thick neck of the Green Dragon slowly turned its gaze to the tree in which Eliane and Peter were hiding. It had set its sights on its next prey.\nI'll be fine, I'll be fine, the trees are dense and narrow around here, so that dragon won't…\nHowever, Eliane's faint hope was crushed by a single swing of the green dragon's wings. After the Green Dragon raised and lowered its thickly coated wings, invisible blades cut down the surrounding trees.\nGreen Dragons belong to the domain of the wind. Just as a human sorcerer can control the blade of the wind, a Green Dragon can also control mana to manipulate the wind blade at will. This ability is the reason why Green Dragons are considered higher-tier dragons.\n\"N-No! I-I…\"\nThe black shadow crawling on the Green Dragon's body emerged once again and stretched towards Eliane and Peter. A shadow where its existence alone was the ‘curse'. If you touch it… it would end up like what Eliane had just witnessed.\nThe Green Dragon let out a deafening cry. It was as if it was mocking Eliane's disgusting behavior.\n\"N-Noooooo!\"\nEliane stood up on shaky legs and was about to flee the scene when the Green Dragon made a swing of its wings. A strong wind forced Eliane's body to stay on the ground. She couldn't escape anymore.\nThe black shadow crawling over the Green Dragon's body flickered up and aimed at Eliane and Peter. They will be ‘taken in'.\n\"Eli! …and Mr. Servant!\"\nStrong arms lifted Eliane's body as if to scoop her up and held her under his arm.\n\"Are you hurt?!\"\nGlenn came to Eliane's rescue by flying at a low altitude. He also held Peter by his side in the same manner as Eliane.\nPeter on the right and Eliane on the left. No matter how young and strong Glenn may be, he was probably having a very hard time. And Glenn's face was bright red right now.\nNevertheless, holding them tightly so as not to drop them, Glenn flew through the gaps between the trees. He knew that if he flew higher than the trees, he would easily become a target for the Green Dragon, which had a high flying ability.\nThe Green Dragon flapped its wings and flew up, following Glenn and the others from above the trees before it stretched out a black shadow from its body like a tentacle.\nFlight magic was supposed to be as fast as a horse, but Glenn's current flying speed was only slightly faster than running. This was probably because he was carrying Eliane and Peter. Compared to the time when she was held in his arms at the school festival, he was obviously much more unsteady.\nPeter shrieked at the shadow that loomed just behind him.\n\"Aaaaah, it's catching up!\"\nJust as the shadows were about to touch Peter and Eliane's legs, Glenn roared throatily.\n\"Not happeniiing!\"\nGlenn used all his strength to throw Eliane and Peter into a nearby bush, where they tumbled over the mossy ground.\n\"Kyaa!\"\n\"Aaah!\"\nBranches and hard leaves from the bushes scratched Eliane's soft skin and tangled in her fluffy hair. It was painful.\nI must have a word or two to say about this treatment, thought Eliane as she got up and looked up.\nThen she saw… Glenn's legs were entangled in a black shadow after letting Eliane and Peter escape. The shadow crawled up from his ankle and entwined itself around his entire body. His body, which had been lifted by flight magic, fell to the ground with a thud, like a bird shot down by an arrow.\n\"Aaaaaaaaaaaarrggh!\"\nA blood-curdling scream poured out of Glenn's mouth. With his body stained with dark spots. Just like the horse before, his body was about to be taken in by the curse. And his face, which was always full of joyful laughter, was now contorted in anguish.\nEliane could only stare at the scene in shivering terror.\nNo… No… This can't be…\nGlenn's body was already half-swallowed by the shadow. His eyes were unfocused and his mouth was leaking a thin voice. But it wasn't a voice of anguish.\n——It was a ‘chant'.\n\"…be… burnt…\"\nA fireball was formed in the palm of Glenn's hand. When the trembling hand pointed to the Green Dragon in the sky, the fireball shot toward it and accelerated.\nThere was a deafening explosion and a flash of light that made it impossible to even open her eyes. Eliane forced her painful eyes open and looked at Glenn and saw him lying limp on the ground with about half of his body eroded by the shadows.\nThe shadow that had been eating away at Glenn slipped back into the green dragon's body, leaving a part of the shadow on his body, then left his body alone.\nThe Green Dragon survived a direct hit from Glenn's fireball and showed no signs of weakening. The dragon's scales which are very resistant to fire make it difficult for fire spells to damage it.\nPerhaps sensing the threat of the fireball, the Green Dragon clad in the curse took one large circle before it flew away.\nPeter in exhausted breath muttered, ‘we're alive…?'\nEliane paid no attention to Peter and approached Glenn with trembling legs.\n\"L-Lord Glenn?\"\nHe did not reply. His body did not move a muscle, but the shadow curse left on his body was crawling around his body.\n\"No… Please no… Lord Glenn, you're okay, right? Please, wake up, Lord Glenn…\"\n\"Don't touch him!\"\nWith a sharp voice, a tall man with black hair grabbed Eliane by the scruff of the neck as if he were handling a kitten—it was Bartholomew Alexander, the attendant of the Silent Witch.\n\"Let go of me… Lord Glenn… Lord Glenn, he was protecting us… He's…\"\n\"He's under a curse right now. Touch him and the curse will infect you.\"\n\"B-But… if we don't do anything… Lord Glenn will die…hic…hic…\"\nWhen Eliane finally began to sob, Bartholomew frowned in annoyance.\nHe took his hand away from Eliane and crouched down in front of Glenn to observe the shadow eating away at Glenn's entire body.\n\"A person with a low amount of mana will be eaten immediately by this thing… For a human being, this guy sure posses that a lot… maybe more than my master?\"\nBartholomew mumbled and touched the shadow crawling over Glenn's body with his fingertips. The shadow seemed to crawl up Bartholomew's finger, but somehow, it moved as if to avoid the finger.\n\"Hmm, all right, I think I can handle it.\"\nBartholomew stood up, carrying Glenn's body roughly on his shoulders, and looked alternately at Eliane and Peter.\n\"Anyways, let's get back to the safe place. Also, call a curse specialist when you get back to the mansion. This thing is not something amateurs can handle.\"",

      "content": "A loud explosion rang in the distant sky, and instantly everyone looked up at the sky.\n\"Hey, what's that?\"\nCount Marre, a guest of Falforia, was the first one to raise his voice. And Count Barrow uttered, ‘a wyvern?' after a short delay.\nHowever, those with good eyesight will immediately notice that the black shadow was clearly larger than the wyvern—indicating that it was a higher-tier dragon.\nWhile the visitors were buzzing about the appearance of a dragon, Felix calmly addressed the group.\n\"Please calm down everyone. As far as I can see, it doesn't seem to be approaching us. However, we should return to the rest area just in case. We can't keep the ladies getting anxious for long.\"\nFelix's composure seemed to bring a bit of reassurance to the group. However, its appearance gave Monica a bad feeling as she clutched at the chest of her robe.\nThe explosion noise she heard earlier was definitely the result of an offensive fire spell. It was probably Glenn's doing since Nero can't use that kind of spell.\nMonica quickly calculated their current position and distance to the rest area, followed by their direction.\nThe explosion rang in a different direction from the rest area… was Glenn acting on his own? What's Nero doing now?\nAs if in response to Monica's question, a servant of Duke Rehnburg's household came from the direction of the rest area, galloping on horseback. He expressed his apology, \"please excuse my conduct in this urgent situation,\" still riding on the horseback, and raised his voice.\n\"I have a message from Lord Bartholomew Alexander! He says, \"Something terrible is approaching!\"\nIt was indeed a message that Nero'd say.\nConsidering its imminent danger, it will end up with Monica being compelled to make up an immediate decision.\nFelix grimaced as he spoke to the messenger.\n\"…did Mr. Bartholomew say anything specific about what was approaching?\"\n‘Well, it's most likely a dragon,' added Felix in a whisper, and the messenger replied with a confused look on his face.\n\"…he said it was \"something\" that looks as close to a dragon.\"\nThese statements gave Monica an uncomfortable feeling.\nNero possesses excellent sensing abilities. If it was a dragon, he would have said it was a dragon. However, when his message was ambiguous as like ‘Something that looks as close to a dragon as possible,' it only gave Monica a growing uneasiness in her chest, so she tugged at the hem of Felix's dress and pointed toward the rest area.\nPerhaps sensing what Monica was trying to say, Felix nodded firmly.\n\"Yeah, we should go back to the rest area for now.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nA huge commotion was already taking place when they arrived at the rest area. The servants were in a panic, Eliane was sobbing, and Glenn was lying on the ground, pale and limp, unmoving.\nIn such a situation, the Duchess of Rehnberg was calmly giving quick instructions to the servants as her usual conduct.\n\"Send an urgent messenger to the capital. You may mention my husband's name if necessary. I will take full responsibility for it. As for you, return to the mansion at once, make arrangements for a doctor, and request reinforcement from the knights… And my daughter Eliane, how long will you keep crying? The situation will not change even if you continue to cry. And if there's nothing you can do, at least stay in the carriage and don't get in the way of others.\"\nAt the Duchess's harsh and sharp words, Eliane finally broke down and cried aloud.\nDuke Rehnberg, who is usually kept in low profile, rushed over to his wife in a panic.\n\"W-What on earth… is going on here?\"\n\"A cursed dragon appears, my dear. To protect Eliane from the dragon, Lord Dudley caught in its curse.\"\nThe atmosphere was frozen at the word ‘a cursed dragon.'\nA cursed dragon, it was something akin to a legend, and nobody, at least no one in this room, had actually witnessed it in person. However, stories about how several cities were destroyed by that cursed being are still passed down to this day. Considering how rare is the case of the curse appeared, they still haven't clarified what is the cause of the ‘curse' itself until today.\nSpeaking of the curse, there are people called witch doctors that can use the art of ‘witchcraft' to create artificial \"curses\" through the application of magic, although few, they do exist. As a prominent example, the family of the Abyssal Shaman, one of the Seven Sages, is adept in using it. While fundamentally, witchcraft is regarded as a semi-prohibited art.\nSometimes, with the permission of the government, it was used to prevent the escape of detained criminals and as a measure to prevent the recidivism of some released criminals, but such arts were not something that anyone could use.\n——When it comes down to it, even Monica, one of the Seven Sages, has very little knowledge about\nit\n.\n\"Oh, you're back?\"\nNero, who had been watching Glenn, came running up to Felix's horse, on which Monica was riding.\nFrom atop his horse, Felix asked, \"Many thanks for alerting us of the danger. How is Dudley's condition?\"\n\"His condition is so bad. If it were a normal person, he'd be dead already. However, thanks to his abundant mana, he can barely resist the curse. It's better not to touch it, or you'll get infected.\"\n\"…how did you manage to carry Dudley here then?\"\n\"I can handle it without a problem. Though if you ask the details, it's ‘secret'.\"\nAs she listened to the exchange between Felix and Nero, Monica desperately racked her brain to comprehend the ‘curse'.\nIt's not only capable of parasitizing dragons, but also the human body? No, rather than parasitizing, it was trying to consume Glenn as food, but Glenn's mana was just barely preventing it from doing so… which means mana has the ability to prevent curses to some extent. But a mere defensive barrier probably is unable to prevent it completely. If I were to incorporate it into a magic formation, it would be similar in nature to dark spells…\n\"Lady Everett?\"\nFelix called out worriedly from behind but Monica's entire attention was focused on the shadow that was eating away at Glenn's body.\nBut her thoughts were interrupted by Peter's shrill voice.\n\"I-It's a dragon! A dragon! Aaaaaah!\"\nPeter pointed to a black shadow in the sky. Soon, the shadow was swooping down at a frightening speed towards them.\nThe Green Dragon, whose entire body was consumed by the black shadow, let out a tremendous roar as it flapped its wings. It created a strong wind that can easily blow away a human being, but just before it strikes the group, Monica cast up a defensive barrier without chanting.\nBut while her defensive barrier could prevent the dragon's attack, it could not prevent the ‘curse' following it.\nJust as Monica feared, the shadow that crawled across the Green Dragon's body flickered and then changed its shape into a sharp spear and rained down from above. The black shadow easily penetrated Monica's defensive barrier.\nWhile the guests of Falforia and the people of Duke Rehnburg screamed in despair, Monica invoked the magic formation she had just thought of.\nPlease be working…!\nTo counter witchcraft, Monica had improvised her own defensive barrier.\nIn general, Monica would never use a technique that has so many flaws in its theory, let alone a spell that has not even been tested in an actual battle. But now she couldn't afford to worry about that, she only hope that her defensive barrier would activate correctly and repel the black shadow. From the looks, it's working and managed to deflect it.\nRealizing that they had just survived a deadly situation, people started to rejoice, however, Monica's expression remained grave from the hopelessness of the situation.\nWe can't keep staying like this… we should take an offensive.\nMonica can only cast two spells at once. Since Monica currently was invoking two defensive barriers: the regular defensive barrier to prevent dragon attacks and the curse defensive barrier to prevent its curse—so now Monica could not perform another spell to attack.\nAlthough some people around were carrying hunting rifles, trying to shoot it would end up as a useless act because the regular defensive barrier would obstruct the bullets. Under this situation, they could only attack it by launching offensive spells from outside the barrier. And perhaps only Glenn was capable enough to use offensive spells to deal a fatal blow to the dragon. However, Glenn had lost consciousness.\nWe need more hands to launch attacks!\nRather than weakening its momentum, the black shadow seemed to be slowly eroding Monica's barrier. Naturally, the curse defensive barrier, which was improvised, still had many flaws. At this rate, it would only be a matter of time before it was crushed by its sheer force.\nLouis could have combined the two barriers into one, and he even could improved it to make it much stronger…\nAs a specialist in defensive barriers, Louis Miller the Barrier Magician is known for his genius in adding multiple effects to a single barrier. If it was him, he would be able to combine the defensive barriers Monica was using into one and use his available hand to cast an offensive spell.\nThe strength of Monica's chantless technique lies in the fact that it can be activated immediately. As such, it can be extremely powerful when taking the initiative but will lose its advantage if she falls behind and ends up on the defensive. And this situation was precisely the case.\nStill, I have to do something… I must do something because I am one of the Seven Sages and also the Silent Witch…\nAt the very least, she wanted to let everyone escape from this place.\nHowever, Monica's barrier was shaped like a dome. So while the people in this place are protected by the barrier, they are also prevented from escaping.\nShould I widen the range of the barrier to the rear and have them move away even a little? But if I expand the range any further, the strength of the curse defensive barrier won't hold out… How about canceling the regular defensive barrier for a moment and using offensive magic afterward? But it will only cause casualties if the Green Dragon's wind blade is not defended against…\nShe felt almost as hopeless as when she was stuck in a chess game. She considered each move she came up with, but inevitably she couldn't find a way to checkmate her enemy.\nTo make matters worse, the horse that Monica and Felix were riding was starting to get agitated. Up until now, Felix had been able to keep it in check, but the fear of the giant creature looming over it must have become too much to bear.\nIf the horse started to rampage, Monica would be thrown off the horse, her concentration would be broken, and the barrier would vanish at the same time. If that happens, the jet-black curse will pour down like rain and take the lives of everyone present.\nI need to do something… I need to think some way…\nIn this seemingly hopeless situation, Felix, behind Monica, made a suggestion.\n\"Lady Everett, is it possible to partially cancel the regular defensive barrier? I only need you to make a hole of a fist size.\"\nWhile saying this, Felix held up the hunting rifle he was carrying on his back.\nUpon realizing what Felix was planning, Monica gulped at his recklessness and nodded at his request.\nEven in this situation, Felix was still maintaining the same calm smile that he'd shown in the student council room.\n\"Lady Everett… please excuse me if the noise is too loud.\"\nFelix readied his hunting rifle and took aim.\n\"…I will aim at its middle forehead.\"\nMonica instantly calculated the trajectory of the bullet based on the angle of the hunting rifle and made a hole in the barrier just a fist size for the bullet to pass through.\nFelix held his breath and put his finger on the trigger.\nBang, such sounds rang close by, and Monica cowered for a moment. The smell of gunpowder tickled her nose.\nOnce Monica looked up above her head as she maintained her barriers, the dragon had already stopped its move.\nHaving been shot at its vital point in the middle of its forehead, the Green Dragon was letting out its last cry of desperation.\n…huh?\nHearing the green dragon's cry, Monica opened her eyes wide to look at the Green Dragon again. But by that time, the Green Dragon had already fallen to the ground as a lifeless husk.\nThe black shadow that had been crawling around the Green Dragon's body also stopped moving with the death of their host.\nAs the smoke from the muzzle of the gun almost covered Monica's face, Felix huffed and blew on the muzzle.\n\"Thank you for believing in me. Lady Everett.\"\nAt this time, neither Felix's sweet voice nor the cheers of the people reached Monica's ears. Only the ‘words' left by the dragon in his last moments rang in her mind.",

      "content": "Glenn was taken to a private room in the duke's mansion and has yet to regain consciousness.\nThe black shadow that clung onto his body had stopped moving after the defeat of the Green Dragon, the source of the curse. However, its remains had not completely disappeared and left bruise-like patches on his body. It looked as if he was being coiled by a giant snake.\nSometimes he would let out an agonized moan or two, but even those voices were too faint to be heard. Anyone could see that the light of his life was almost extinguished.\nBesides Glenn, Monica and Nero were present in this room. Since there was a possibility that the curse remaining in Glenn's body might move and attack people, she had prohibited the servants from entering and leaving the room.\nAs Monica observed the shadow that remained on Glenn's body, she muttered.\n\"Nero… The last words of that Green Dragon… you heard them, right?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nThe high-ranking dragons do understand human ‘words'. However, due to the structure of their vocal organs, they have difficulty expressing themselves in human language, so most dragons speak spirits language.\nSince Monica had learned spirits language during her time in Minerva, she was able to understand some of it.\n——Unforgivable. Unforgivable. I will never forgive that human being.\nThat Green Dragon clearly loathed humans. A person… to be specific.\n\"That Green Dragon was quite weak by the time I detected it. That explains why I couldn't sense its presence right away.\"\nIn normal cases, Nero's sensing ability should have caught it immediately, since a high-ranking dragon has mana as strong as a spirit or even stronger. However, because of its weak presence, Nero's sense was unable to detect the Green Dragon immediately.\n\"What my sense perceived was cursed-like mana shaped like a dragon. Since that wriggling snake-like thing was about the size of a dragon, I thought it might be a dragon. And I was right.\"\nThe curse probably had weakened the Green Dragon.\nHowever, Monica had no idea where the curse originated in the first place. Nor did she know how to break the curse that was eating away Glenn.\nIs having to defeat the Green Dragon, the source of the curse, not enough? If Glenn is engulfed by the curse at this point… what will happen to him?\nPouring a large amount of mana into Glenn might be able to help him repel the curse. But it would only have a temporary effect, and if it was done poorly, Glenn would become poisoned by mana.\nThe curse might be able to be removed by force, but she had no idea if Glenn's body would be able to withstand the process.\nToo little information related to the curse for her to be able to break the current situation. For now, all she can do is wait for the specialists to arrive.\nI'm sorry I couldn't protect you, Glenn.\nDespite being one of the Seven Sages, the greatest magicians in the kingdom, Monica could do nothing in front of her friend's suffering face.\nAs she bit her lip in helplessness, a discreet knock came on the door of the room.\nAfter confirming that Monica had promptly placed her hood over her head, Nero opened the door slightly.\n\"Who's there?\"\nAfter looking through the doorway, he found Eliane standing there.\nWith teary, swollen eyes, Eliane tiptoed onto her feet, tried to peer over Nero's shoulder into the room.\n\"Um, how's Lord Glenn's condition…?\"\n\"You were not supposed to come near this room.\"\nAs Nero proceeded to close the door, Eliane hurriedly stuck her hand in the gap between the doors.\n\"Can Master Glenn be saved? He can be saved, right? I mean, there's a Seven Sage in this room…\"\n\"Curses is different from regular magic. You need a specialist to handle it.\"\nEven after hearing Nero's plain statement in annoyance, Eliane still stubbornly persisted.\n\"But, didn't Lady Silent Witch just repel the curse with her barrier? If she uses the same method to remove Lord Glenn's curse maybe…\"\n\"There's a difference between warding off a curse and lifting it. The shock forcibly pulling off the curse would only speed up his death.\"\nHearing Nero's words, Eliane gasped with a shocked look on her face.\nEliane also felt responsible for this, because Glenn suffered the curse after protecting Eliane and a servant named Peter.\nThe face of the beautiful girl, who always smiled so dainty, now looked like a wilted flower.\n\"… I apologize… for disturbing you.\"\nEliane apologized in a shaky voice and quietly closed the door.\nThe sound of sobbing could be heard from the other side of the door afterward. Seeing that it was getting further away, Nero let out a sigh with a troublesome look on his face.\n\"Good grief. Do they all think that the Seven Sages can fix everything?\"\nHowever, that was not unreasonable. To common people, magic and witchcraft probably don't look much different. That's why they assume that the Seven Sages, the greatest magicians in the kingdom, would be able to deal with curses.\nAs a matter of fact, witchcraft itself is extremely uncommon. Moreover, since it is treated as a quasi-prohibited art, opportunities to learn it are fewer and farther between, with only the families that specialize in it having access to it.\nMonica had improvised a protective barrier against the curse based on what little she had learned from the book and Glenn's symptoms, and it was not something that anyone should be able to do.\nEven so, Monica couldn't help but blame herself. She wished she could have done better.\n\"A cursed dragon is a legendary disaster that even I've never seen before. It's a miracle there were no other casualties.\"\n\"But I couldn't save Glenn… and I don't know what to say to Louis…\"\nIt was then that Glenn, lying in bed, moaned in pain. Reflexively looking at the bed, Monica was startled.\n\"Get away from him, Monica.\"\nNero dragged Monica off the bed and stared at the curse eating away at Glenn.\n\"…the Loud Boy's mana is decreasing… no, it's… being sucked out?\"\nHowever, despite having absorbed Glenn's mana, the movement of the shadow didn't seem to have become much more active.\n——Where did the magic that it sucked out of Glenn go?\nNero and Monica came up with an answer at the same time and looked up.\n\"Could it be it went back to the cursed dragon's place?\"\n\"It's not impossible. Some part of the curse sucks out the mana from the prey and sends it to the main part of the curse in the dragon.\"\nApproaching the window, Nero directed his gaze in the direction of the hunting grounds.\nThe sun had already set, and outside the window was a star-filled sky and a dark night that stretched far into the forest. Even without light, Nero can sense what is in the depths of such darkness.\nIt was then one of his jutted black hair twitched like a cat's tail.\n\"It looks like our prediction was correct. That curse is approaching closer by the minute.\"\n\"!?\"\nNero and Monica have made sure that no sign of life was detected in the cursed dragon. The dragon was definitely dead.\nBut now he said he sensed it was approaching, which that meant…\n\"The dragon may be dead, but the curse is alive…? Anyway, we need to do something about the source of the curse immediately.\"\n\"Want me to take care of it?\"\nAt Nero's proposal, Monica pondered for a few seconds and shook her head.\n\"Let me take care of it first. But can you… come with me?\"\nLifting the corner of his mouth and showing his sharp teeth, Nero smiled, \"Of course!\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAfter the dinner with the envoys of Falforia, Felix returned to his room, loosened the tie around his collar, and exhaled.\nNeither the Silent Witch nor her attendant was present at the dinner party today. Both of them were taking care of Glenn Dudley, who had been affected by the curse. Calling it nursing may sound nice, but in reality, it would be more accurate to call it watching over.\nMany were concerned that the curse that was eating away at Glenn would attack other people. Some people even considered that it would be better if he could be killed right away.\nOf course, in order to prevent this from happening, Felix isolated Glenn as soon as possible and put him under surveillance.\n… ironically enough, this incident received no bad response from Falforia's envoys.\nThe people of Falforia, especially the narrow-minded Count Marre, gave much consideration to the Silent Witch had prevented the curse and minimized casualties, and also to Felix, which had put an end to the cursed dragon with his sniping.\nAt the dinner table, Count Marre seemed not to be displeased as he praised Felix's skill with a gun. Maybe having experienced the threat of a dragon firsthand has given him a certain understanding of the matter of the Dragon Knights garrison.\nAbove all, the fact that he was able to survive a legendary disaster provides him with an opportunity to be talked about—basically it becomes his heroic story.\nOnce the envoys of Falforia return to their home countries, they will surely spread the word about how terrifying the dragons were. While conveniently ignoring the fact that they were helpless to do anything about it and act like heroes who survived the dragon threat.\nAt the same time, Duke Rehnberg and his wife would praise Felix as a hero. Before long, word will spread throughout the kingdom that the second prince, Felix Ark Ridill, has defeated the cursed dragon.\nA heroic story of a prince who slew the dragon foretold by the Star Oracle Witch just sounds like…\n…well played scenario.\nWith his darkened eyes, Felix looked at the envelope he had thrown on his writing desk. An envelope bearing the emblem of a two-headed dragon had been sent to him by Duke Crockford. The letter, which was handed to him upon his arrival at the mansion, briefly stated.\nHis Majesty the King is showing signs of illness. Handle the situation without fail.\nTo the unaware party, it could be read as, ‘As His Majesty, the King is not in good health, make sure to handle everything without fail so as to relieve the burden on the King.'\nHowever, Felix could see Duke Crockford's true intentions very clearly.\n——The king is nearing the end of his life. Do everything in your power to become the next king.\nThis incident is also one of ‘preparation' for that.\nStaring at the letter gravely, Felix lifted the edge of his mouth.\n\"…how annoying.\"\nMuttering lowly, he placed the envelope in the fireplace.\nThe emblem of Dukes Crockford—the two-headed dragon—was turning to ashes.\nFelix couldn't help but think that the ‘calamity' that the Star Oracle Witch had foretold was not the cursed dragon, but the two-headed dragon that undermines the country.\nAs he shoved the ashes of the letter further away, a white lizard, Will, slithered out of his pocket.\n\"Your Highness, I have terrible news. The cursed dragons from daytime are approaching this mansion.\"\n\"Oh, really? I thought I pierced its eyebrow, but it's still alive? It sure has a lot of life force.\"\nAfter throwing a remark without changing his facial expression, Felix grabbed his hunting rifle that was propped up in the corner of the room.\nDespite having the typical expressionless face of a reptilian, Will was still perplexed as he looked up at Felix.\n\"Um, Your Highness? Have you reported it to the duke's household and Lady of the Seven Sages?\"\n\"‘Handle the situation without fail,' that's what that man had ordered.\"\nAll Felix's expression vanished from his face.\nWhen the gentle smile disappeared from his well-formed face, a chilling air took over the young man, making him seem somewhat hollow, yet chilling to the viewers.\n\"As Duke Crockford's puppet, let's deal with whatever comes out of that man's mouth, shall we?\"",

He really wanted to take his horse with him, but he gave up when he saw a stable boy in the stable.\nAfter all, what he was about to do couldn't be witnessed by anyone else.\n\"Will, where's the current location of that cursed dragon?\"\nIn response to Felix's words, Will, who was now a lizard, poked his head out of his breast pocket and replied apologetically.\n\"It's in the north-northeast, and the distance is… sorry, it's still vague.\"\n\"Okay. Let me know as soon as you figure it out.\"\nWill's sensing ability was not particularly high, nevertheless, it allowed him to figure out a vague direction. Even so, with the huge body of the cursed dragon, as long as he could get close enough with it, he should be able to sense it.\nFelix moved carefully while keeping himself low profile from the cursed dragon. If he was going to shoot, it would be better to do so at a certain altitude.\nAfter a short distance, he found a moderately high hill. It had just the right amount of trees on it for him to hide. The darkness of the night also played a role in this.\nFelix took out a small case from his pocket and pulled out a bullet from inside.\nUnlike the one used for hunting in the daytime, these specially made bullets were coated with silver, which could easily accumulate mana.\n\"Will.\"\nIn response to Felix's voice, Will poured ice mana into the bullet. He was preparing the so-called ‘incidental magic'. A very powerful one at that.\nDragons are highly magic-resistant creatures, but they are vulnerable to cold and ice magic. If you can strike it into its body, you can stop it from moving.\n\"Actually, I wanted to use these bullets during the incident in the daytime. But I couldn't let your powers be exposed in public. So I had no choice.\"\nMuttering, Felix positioned the bullet poured with mana into his hunting rifle.\nIt's about time.\n\"…Your Highness, the cursed dragon is coming.\"\n\"I understand.\"\nNot long after Felix arrived at the shooting position, he heard the sound of something huge approaching. It didn't need to be mentioned which something was—it was a cursed dragon.\nWhat used to be a Green Dragon was crawling on the ground, dragged by the black shadow that wriggled all over its body. There was none of the dignity of a high-ranking dragon left.\nThat was the end result of a pitiful creature whose entire body was consumed by the curse.\n\"What a miserable sight. We may be different species, but seeing your dignity sullied makes me feel pity.\"\nMuttering, Felix readied his hunting rifle.\nThe range of the hunting rifle was not particularly impressive. To be able to make an effective shot, he would have to wait a little longer for the cursed dragon to approach closer.\n\"I'll end your pain now.\"\nAiming was not that difficult. The target was large and, above all, it was relatively slow. Compared to aiming at the brow of a dragon flying from a horse in the daytime, this was no more than child's play.\nFelix's finger pulled the trigger.\nAfter the bullet was fired into the half-opened mouth of the Green Dragon, its movements stopped for a moment. The bullet that had been lodged in the dragon's throat exploded in its mouth in the form of spears of ice.\nThe dragon didn't even make a sound but started to thrash around.\nWithout hesitation, Felix loaded the second bullet and pulled the trigger.\nThe second shot accurately pierced the Green Dragon's right eye. The bullet that entered the head through the right eye released spears of ice and stirred the dragon's head to tatters.\nThe corpse of the dragon, with ice spears protruding from its mouth cavity and right eye, even looked somewhat like an eerie sculpture.\nYet, the dragon did not stop moving.\nOn the contrary, the dragon changed its movement direction towards Felix. The black shadow like a giant serpent, as if leading the dragon, was changing its target to Felix.\n\"Your Highness, in my long life, I've only seen a cursed dragon once.\"\n\"Hm.\"\n\"I've seen once the dragon, the main body, dies, the curse dissipated… but this…\"\nTo keep the flustered Will from falling out of his breast pocket, Felix held the lid of his pocket with his hand and ran off with his hunting rifle.\n\"Then I suppose it's no ordinary curse.\"\nThe cursed dragon seemed to have set its sights completely on Felix.\nFelix tried to escape by taking advantage of the shadows of the trees as much as possible, but the cursed black shadow kept creeping up towards Felix without regard to the darkness of the night.\nIn normal cases, a cursed dragon is a ‘naturally occurring curse' that has taken possession of a dragon.\nBut if Felix's deduction is correct…\n\"I suspect that was not a naturally occurring curse, but a man-made ‘witchcraft'.\"\n\"Is that any different from a naturally occurring ‘curse'?\"\n\"While I don't know about naturally occurring ‘curses', if it's witchcraft, there must be a ‘witchcraft tool' somewhere to act as a medium.\"\nFelix surveyed the dragon approaching behind him as he ran. He didn't see anything that looked like a \"witchcraft tool\" in his sight. He then pondered, how he would place the \"witchcraft tool\" into the dragon if he were him. And the answer came quickly.\n…he must have mixed it with the food and fed it to it.\nOnce the ‘witchcraft tool' was put in the dragon's stomach, it was nearly impossible to do anything to it from the outside.\nThe dragon's body is protected by thick scales. Even if you could destroy the head by targeting the eyes and mouth, as Felix did, it would not be easy to get the attack deep into its stomach.\nThis must have been unexpected even for the person who cast this curse… perhaps because the curse was too strong, it got out of control.\nFelix took cover behind a tree, loaded his bullets, and then jumped out from behind the tree, firing his hunting rifle at the dragon's mouth. The third bullet also accurately pierced the dragon's throat, generating ice spears… but it probably didn't reach deep into its stomach.\nWell, I doubt even Duke Crockford would have expected this \"incident\" to end this way.\nThe black shadow, the embodiment of the curse, extended itself like a spear and charged at Felix. Evading was no longer possible.\nIn the face of impending death, Felix thought composedly. If he were to die here and now, how much of his name would remain in people's hearts.\nA prince who tried to protect his people from the dragon's damage in exchange for his life… I guess I deserve a little credit.\nAs the black shadow tried to pierce the man, who was still preoccupied with his thoughts even at the point of death—the shadow suddenly flicked away along with a solid sound coming from it.\nThe doll-like expression on Felix's face was filled with surprise.\nIn front of him stood an anti-curse barrier. Since the only person who can do this is…\n\"You sure are one prince who likes a night out.\"\nA man with tall stature and black hair, Bartholomew Alexander, came rushing towards him from behind the cursed dragon. Riding on his back was the Silent Witch holding a staff in her hand.\nThe barrier she had put up had saved Felix in the nick of time.\nPutting down the Silent Witch from his back, Bartholomew glared at Felix with his golden eyes.\n\"Look at that, master. That prince finally got tired of playing with human women and started chasing a female dragon's ass.\"\nFelix responded to the flippant remark with a composed face that did not resemble that of a dying man.\n\"Oh, this dragon was a female?\"\n\"She got a sexy tail at that.\"\nStanding next to Bartholomew, who was making light of the situation, the Silent Witch waved her staff.\nThe next moment, about ten ice spears were born above the cursed dragon's head, skewering its huge wings as if they were sewn into the ground. Unlike the scales on its body, the scales on the wings were relatively thin. As the ice spears pierced it like a stake, the cursed dragon cried out in anger.\nThe skewered dragon's body could no longer move, and it could not freely control the wind mana—but the black shadow encircling the dragon was still wriggling like a giant snake. Even now, it still relentlessly targets Felix.\nEventually, realizing that it would be difficult to destroy the barrier, the black shadow set its sights on its new prey, the Silent Witch and her attendant.\n\"Lady Everett! I suspect someone has cast ‘witchcraft' on it. Perhaps a ‘witchcraft tool' was placed somewhere in its body.\"\nAt Felix's urging, Bartholomew's eyes widened in surprise.\n\"Witchcraft!? Those are the sort of magic used by humans, aren't they!? I've never heard of a dragon being controlled by humans using witchcraft!\"\nOf course, Felix had never heard of controlling a dragon with witchcraft. However, half of his guts told him.\n——This was a \"witchcraft\" set by a shaman, the pawn of Duke Crockford.\nPerhaps, it was originally a spell that allowed a person to manipulate the cursed dragon to some degree.\nSo that person lured the dragon to the Falforia's envoys to make Felix work together with the Silent Witch to defeat the dragon.\nIt needs to be done to demonstrate the danger of dragon damage to the Falforia side and convince them about the Dragon Knights garrison, and at the same time, to give Felix a foil as ‘the prince who defeated the legendary cursed dragon'.\nMoreover, Felix should be able to impress the people around him by showing that he has a good relationship with the Seven Sages.\n…unfortunately, the witchcraft got out of control and it went berserk.\nAlthough Bartholomew was incredulous, the clever Silent Witch immediately sprang into action.\nWith a single swing of her ill-fitting long staff, the spears of ice that had been skewering the cursed dragon disappeared, replaced by spears of fire.\nAs the spears of fire blazed in crimson, a part of it extended like a snake and entered the mouth of the cursed dragon.\nDuring this time, the black shadow tried desperately to resist, attacking Felix and the Silent Witch in response, but they were all blocked by the anti-curse barrier.\nIf the Green Dragon was still alive, it would have been able to attack them with its wind blade. However, the Green Dragon's body had already lost its mana, leaving nothing but a corpse. Like a puppet being dragged by a string, it was only moved because of the witchcraft itself.\nIn spite of the black shadow's resistance, a muffled explosion sounded from inside the dragon's body. The Silent Witch had exploded her fire inside its stomach.\nOnce the medium of the curse in the stomach of the dragon was destroyed, the black shadow gradually faded and disappeared as if it were melting into the darkness of the night.\nAll that remained was the battered corpse of the Green Dragon. The curse of black shadow no longer remained on its green scales.\nThe Silent Witch had triumphed over witchcraft.\n\"…Lady Everett.\"\nFelix hesitantly walked up to the Silent Witch.\nHe was prepared to be questioned about the fact that he had left the mansion in the middle of the night. Still, he felt he must thank the lady who had saved his life.\n\"You've always saved my life.\"\nFelix was prepared to die at that time. But the Silent Witch came and saved Felix's life. She had risked her life to face the cursed dragon.\nA strong emotion shook his heart, different from respect or admiration, it moved Felix impulsively.\nSince the Silent Witch clutched her wand with her right hand and kept her head down, Felix took her left hand then tried to drop a kiss of gratitude on the back of her hand.\n…but the Silent Witch forcefully pulled out her left hand.\n\"Lady Everett?\"\n\"……!!!\"\nA sound of suppressing grunts leaked out from underneath the robe, and at the same time, the Silent Witch collapsed to her knees.\nIn his left hand, there was a black thread, as thin as a hair, wrapped around her hand.\n\"Oh no!\"\nBartholomew shrieked, and as if brushing away a spider's thread, he brushed away the black thread that was entangled in the Silent Witch's left hand.\nThe black thread snapped in midair, leaving part of it in the left hand of the Silent Witch, and slid back into the corpse of the Green Dragon.\nWhen Felix saw this, he finally realized.\nThe curse—the witchcraft itself—was still alive.\nThe Silent Witch, who had received a curse on her left hand, collapsed to the ground without uttering a word.",

      "content": "The black shadow was already entangled in her left hand when Monica noticed a hair-thin shadow creeping in the dark.\nNo matter what she does, even if she tries to cast a barrier to repel it with her chantless spell, she will no longer make it in time. So she had to shake off Felix's hand that tried to touch her left hand, keep her distance away, and concentrate her mana to her left hand to prevent the curse from spreading on her entire body.\nFortunately, Nero's quick intervention had helped Monica to repel the curse so only a very small amount of the curse adhered to her body. In fact, she might be able to be suppressed this amount of curse using her mana… or so she thought. But, she soon realized that she had been too naive.\nEach time her heartbeat once, she felt intense pain from her left elbow down as if several tiny nails had been hammered into her veins. And to suppress her scream, Monica had to bite her right arm. If it was another place, she might have rolled over and cried out from a long ago.\nMonica vaguely felt that Nero lifted her body in his arms, shouting something incomprehensible. Together with him, Felix was also shouting something with a very pale face. However, she couldn't hear their voices didn't anymore. Only the sound of her own heart beating echoed loudly in her head.\nGroaning in a muffled voice, Monica gathered her mana in her left arm to hold off the spread of the curse even for a moment.\nShe felt her head spinning, her vision was obscured by flickers of red and black in front of her eyes before everything was turning dark.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nIn her hazy vision, she saw something there.\nThere was a collapsed dragon. Different from the cursed dragon before, its body, which was two sizes smaller was covered with green scales. Perhaps that Green Dragon was still in its infancy. And its body, which had been consumed more than 80% by the black shadow was no longer moving.\nStanding by the corpse of a young Green Dragon was a person. A human being. She couldn't see his face because it was blurred. But from the lines of his body, she could barely tell that he was an adult male.\n\"Dammit. Another failure.\"\nMuttering in annoyance, the man turned around and was about to leave the scene, abandoning the remains of the little dragon.\nBut then a lone Green Dragon, which probably the mother of the little dragon, descended. The Green Dragon was enraged and tried to hunt the human man, but the man skillfully hid behind a rock.\nThe dragon thought, if this continues, it will lose sight of that hateful man and chance to kill him.\n——I will never forgive him! I will never forgive him! I will never forgive him!\nConsidering that the dragon only saw that human face briefly, it sure it would no longer be possible to find him if were that man blended in with the crowd of humans.\nThe curse itself has become weakened with the death of the little dragon. If left alone, it would probably vanish on its own eventually. So before that happen, the Green Dragon opened its mouth… to eat the remains of its own child.\nIt erected sharp fangs tore at the still soft scales and skin, devouring the flesh along with the curse that killed its beloved child. Afterward, the curse had incorporated into the Green Dragon.\nSince the ‘witchcraft' imbued with plenty of the shaman's mana, it made it easier to track that man by following his mana.\n——I will definitely tear that man to pieces!\nUnbeknownst to Green Dragon, the weakening witchcraft that had been taken into its body was transformed by its strong hatred.\nThe weakened witchcraft had turned into an actual curse.\nAnd the Green Dragon, which had turned into an actual cursed dragon, flapped its wings and began moving to find and kill the hateful man who killed her child with witchcraft.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nPerhaps after touching the curse, it allowed Monica to catch a glimpse of the Green Dragon's memories,\nAh…\nIn her fading consciousness, Monica came to realize.\nIf ‘curse' is something that's naturally created when negative emotions are accidentally mixed with dark mana, then ‘witchcraft' is something that's created by human hands through the arts.\nA truly powerful ‘curse' was born after human-made ‘witchcraft' had been exposed to the hatred of the Green Dragon…\nAfter the black shadow was absorbing Monica's mana and sending it into the Green Dragon's body. Its body began to move again, albeit slowly.\nWith ice spears sprouting from its head, its wings tattered, and its stomach burned from the inside out, the Green Dragon should have long ceased to be alive. And yet, the curse that had imbued with its obsession kept its tattered body to move.\nIt was all to get revenge on the human that killed its child.\nMonica could hear the Green Dragon's vindictive voices in her head. It kept echoing over and over again.\nI'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry…\nShe knew that there was no point in apologizing to it. Even so, she felt like she would go insane if she stop begging for forgiveness.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nPerhaps after losing her consciousness, the head of the Silent Witch in the arms of her attendant slumped down. At the same time, the body of the cursed dragon slowly rose and began to move once again.\nFacing the worst situation, Felix gritted his teeth. He might have bullets that could kill the dragon, but it won't work on the curse. After what all happened, he had no intention of dying heroically. After all, his adored Lady Everett had collapsed while protecting him. So he couldn't let her die in this place.\n\"…I'll buy you some time, you take Lady Everett and run away from here,\" adjusting his hunting rifle, Felix told Bartholomew with a grim face. But Bartholomew paid no attention to him and laid the body of the Silent Witch down on the grass nearby. Then, with an almost unnatural gait, Bartholomew slipped past Felix and approached the curse-spreading dragon.\n\"Didn't I say to not break with my master?\"\nDespite no wind blowing, Bartholomew's black hair rustled and swayed.\nThe body of the attendant of the Silent Witch gradually darkened as if it were melting in the night. Leaving only the golden eyes shining brightly, as if they were floating in the darkness.\n\"… I will do you a favor as a fellow species. I'll reduce you to dust in an instant so that you won't have to show your pathetic form any longer.\"\nThe darkness surrounding Bartholomew swelled with a tangible mass.\nHis body, which was even larger than the Green Dragon's, was covered with scales that looked like obsidian. Stretching out from the back of such a huge body was a pair of wings. On its thick arms were sharp jet-black claws, and a mouth so large that even a cow would be torn off instantly with its sharp fangs.\n…in addition, his golden eyes that shining brighter than the moon in the night sky.\nFelix could feel Will's small trembling in his breast pocket. More so for himself, who could barely contain his shudder, but still could not hide his astonishment.\nAn entity in front of him was said to be one whom the Silent Witch had once defeated. A legendary dragon whose stronghold was near the Wogan Mountains in the County of Kelbeck, and who was followed by more than 20 wyverns.\n\"The Black Dragon Wogan…\"\nAs if responding to Felix's murmur, the Black Dragon turned up his neck and hissed.\nTaking a deep breath in, the Black Dragon's mouth opened wide, spewing out jet-black flames with its breath.\nDeeper than the shadow of the curse and more beautiful than the darkness of the night, the black flames enveloped the body of the cursed dragon, painting its body into black as if it were melting into flames.\nJust within three blinks of time, the cursed dragon burned up without a trace along with the curse that had been eating away at it.\nThe flames breathed out by the Black Dragon, just like the flames of the underworld, consume everything whether it's a barrier or a curse. Once the flames are unleashed, no one can prevent them. All things become dust in the same manner.\nThe Black Dragon tilted his long neck lazily and looked down at Felix, who stood there dumbfounded.\nHis golden eyes were gazing at Felix with inhumanly reptilian characteristics. It was like they were trying to find out his true intentions.\nWhen Felix stared back into his eyes without flinching, the Black Dragon breathed out a snort.\nSuddenly, the Black Dragon's body melted into the blurry jet-black miasma just like water before forming the shape of an adult male.\nOnce the blur cleared completely, Bartholomew Alexander—A young man with dark hair and golden eyes, the attendant of the Silent Witch—was standing there.\n\"Wow, you've got some balls not to run away, Prince.\"\n\"This still surprises me in its own way…weren't you supposed to have been exterminated by Lady Everett?\"\n\"You humans will feel safer if things are left that way.\"\nAt the Black Dragon's words, Felix swallowed his rebuttal.\nWhat this dragon said was right. If the people found out that the legendary Black Dragon had become a familiar of the Seven Sages… most likely panic would break out in the kingdom.\nTaking a dragon as a familiar is unheard of. Not to mention, a legendary Black Dragon at that, there has been no such witch in history.\nSome people might treat the Black Dragon as dangerous and scream for it to be slain.\nOr some may carry the Silent Witch and the Black Dragon as a deterrent to other countries, if not as a weapon of war. And Duke Crockford would certainly do so.\nAnd the Silent Witch probably wouldn't want that either.\nAs Felix fell silent, the Black Dragon in human form grinned at him, showing his sharp teeth.\n\"Worried? Afraid? Relax. I am the Silent Witch's familiar. As long as she is my master, I will not attack humans.\"\nLifting up his master, the Silent Witch, the Black Dragon lazily turned his head and looked at Felix.\n\"But, you know, if you tell anybody about my true identity, then…\"\nWith a vicious smile on his mouth, his jagged, sharp teeth clattering menacingly.\nThe golden eyes were looking somewhat mischievously at Felix.\n\"You can expect your head crushed in my mouth.\"",

      "content": "The current head of the Albright family, one of the few families in the Kingdom of Ridill who specializes in witchcraft, the Third Abyssal Sorcerer, Ray Albright was comparatively young when compared to the other Seven Sages, having just turned 20 years old.\nHis reasonably fine-looking face with slanted eyes and a straight nose was somewhat too thin and pale. In addition, his loose and disheveled hair, as if the amethyst powder had been bleached into it were purple in color. His eyes, outlined by matching colored eyelashes, were so vividly pink that they looked as if they had been inlaid with gemstones.\nHis overly flashy purple hair and pink eyes leave a strong impression more than his fine-looking face on those who see him.\nAnd now such flashy-looking young shaman was touching the still laying on the bed Monica's left hand, speaking to her in a pleading voice.\n\"…do you love me?\"\nWith a stiff face and sweats forming on her forehead, Monica looked back at the Abyssal Shaman.\n\"Um, well…\"\n\"Do you love me? Do you need me?\"\n\"I need you… very much… but…\"\n\"Then will you tell me you love me?\"\nWhen Nero saw Ray leaning closer to the bed, he grabbed his neck to pull him away before creasing his nostrils and snorting.\n\"If you want someone to say \"I love you,\" I can say it for you until you feel satisfied. I love you, I love you. Come on, get on with the treatment already.\"\n\"…Being told by a man wouldn't make me happy at all. I much prefer girls instead.\"\nAs Ray made a sulky expression, Nero looked at Monica with a face of utter dismay.\n\"Hey, is this guy really one of the Seven Sages? Or are the Seven Sages a group of weirdos?\"\n*stabs in the heart*\nUnable to say anything back to Nero's words, Monica could only clam up.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nMonica hardly remembered anything after what happened when she suffered from the curse.\nAccording to Nero, he had used his black flame to incinerate the cursed dragon including the curse crawling on its body before it vanished without a trace.\nWhile it was rather regrettable for Nero's identity to be exposed to Felix, given the circumstances, she could not blame him for it. Rather, both Monica and Felix were able to return alive because Nero was fully prepared to reveal his true identity in order to defeat the cursed dragon.\nWhile Nero made sure to keep Felix quiet about his identity as Black Dragon Wogan, the latter returned to the mansion to give Monica time to rest.\nWith the witchcraft had been destroyed by Nero's flames, the cursed black shadows crawling on Monica's and Glenn's skin have completely disappeared. But, some after-effects were still present, leaving Monica with a bluish-black bruise on her left hand and Glenn with a bruise all over his body.\nAlthough the pain was no longer as intense as the pain of nails hitting blood vessels, her injured left hand had almost no strength, and she felt ached when she tried to move it forcibly.\nOne night passed afterward, and Ray Albright, the witchcraft expert called by Duke Rehnberg, arrived at the mansion.\nMonica was a little surprised when she saw he was coming. After all, Ray preferred idling in his home and rarely going out.\nHowever, she was convinced when she recalled the appearance of the cursed dragon, a legendary disaster. After all, it was only natural for the country's most renowned shaman to come to investigate the situation. At least in the field of witchcraft, no one can match the Third ‘Abyssal Sorcerer' Ray Albright.\nContrary to her expectation, as soon as he arrived, the country's best shaman was asking, \"Do you need me? Do you love me?\" and pestered the maids spectacularly. Even after the people around him used all kinds of methods to coax him into Monica's room… the situation was still ended up this way.\n\"…everyone always talks in my back and says shaman are so creepy…\"\nReleased from Nero's hands, Rey drooped gloomily as he covered his face with his hands.\n\"I just want people to think shamans are cool, but everyone always thinks shamans are ‘gloomy' ‘uncanny', and ‘creepy'… I just want to be respected, be fawned over, and to be loved… I mean, who's not want to be popular?! Look at the Barrier Magician, there are many young girls fawning over him. Damn, a person like him should just die, die, die, die, die…\"\nRey kept mumbling over his resentment in a voice that sounded like the grudge could project itself. But Nero assured him in earnest.\n\"Rest assured, I guarantee you… even if you weren't a shaman, you'd still look gloomy, uncanny, and creepy.\"\n\"Nero!\"\nMonica hurriedly chided Nero and gathered her poor vocabulary to appease Rey as hard as she could.\n\"W-Well, you shouldn't let his words get into you. I think shaman's an honorable job. There's nothing creepy about it.\"\nRay glanced at Monica through the gap between his fingers.\n\"Many said the color of my hair and eyes are creepy… if only I had blonde hair and blue eyes, or maybe a more conservative ones…\"\nThe First Abyssal Shaman had engraved more than a hundred witchcrafts in his own body.\nJust as the royal family members drank poison in small doses from childhood to build up its resistance, the first generation of Abyssal Shaman also built up a resistance to witchcraft in their own bodies.\nMany witchcraft that he had engraved into his body was passed down to the next generation of Abyssal Shaman. And the Third Abyssal Shaman, Ray's body bears more than 200 witchcraft, while patterns of curses would appear like tattoos on his skin from time to time.\nTherefore, because of a large amount of witchcraft that had been engraved in his body, his hair and eyes had undergone unusual coloration due to pigmentary abnormalities.\nSimilar to mana poisoning, it would poison the body when a large amount of mana is taken into. No matter how they are taken in, both mana and curses can be poison to the human body when taken in large quantities. When that happens, it can lead to all sorts of abnormalities occurring in the body.\n\"Oh, um, I think purple is a very noble color and beautiful…\"\nHearing Monica's earnest words, Ray slowly raised his head. He looked at Monica as his jewel-like pink eyes glowed eerily from the depths.\n\"… then, do you love me? Do you love me? Will you tell me you love me?\"\nAs it turns out, if she doesn't tell him she loves him, he won't give her the treatment.\nBut Monica was not skillful enough to be able to say \"I love you\" affably in such situations.\n\"Well, um…I would say I love you as a senior of the Seven Sages, and I admire you and respect yuh—*bites*.\"\nAlthough she bit her lip dramatically at the end, Ray seemed to feel her sincerity in Monica's words.\nHe mumbled \"admire, respect, admire, respect…\" and his smile was somewhat ecstatic as he slowly lifted the edge of his mouth before smiling eerily.\n\"This feels great. Being adored makes me feel like a special person. Although it's more modest compared to saying ‘I love you.' But being respected huh… it feels great to have someone admire and respect me.\"\n\"Hey, isn't that be enough? Just get it over with already.\"\nAt Nero's exasperated words, Rey simply nodded his head and said, \"Alright.\"\nFeeling rather exasperated at the thought of the wasted time from Ray's arrival to the starting of his treatment, Monica silently rolled up the sleeves of her sleepwear.\nMonica's slender arms were covered in bluish bruises starting from the elbows down to the lower part of her arms. It was not just the bruises, but streaks as thin as her hair, reddish-black in color etched on her arms. Touching the bruises with his fingers, Rey squinted his eyes and muttered, \"These bruises were not caused by witchcraft, not a natural curse.\"\nAlthough Monica was unable to distinguish between a naturally occurring curse and an artificial one, apparently in the eyes of an expert the difference was obvious.\n\"Is it that thing easy to differ?\"\nNero interjected with intrigue, but the ever-hating men Abyssal Shaman was always cold toward men, so Ray replied curtly, \"it is.\"\n\"…witchcraft tends to leave behind some remnants. As long as a piece of the witchcraft tool that was used as a medium for the witchcraft remains, the curse that blended into the piece may remain forever in there.\"\nIn fact, the curse remained stubbornly in place even after Monica's attack inside the dragon's body. Perhaps Monica's flame magic alone was not enough to completely burn away the remaining witchcraft tool.\n\"…From the looks of it, you seemed to have destroyed the witchcraft tool completely, since the curse had vanished cleanly,\" said Ray in admiration, but Nero standing behind him seemed to be proud of himself.\nAfter all, what destroyed the cursed tool was the all-devouring flames of the legendary black dragon. Since neither the body nor the curse of the cursed dragon had remained, it had spared Monica from suffering any severe aftereffects.\nWith Nero being Monica's attendant on the surface, she couldn't tell Ray about Nero's true identity. Not even Louis knows Nero's true identity. Only Monica…\nAh, His Highness knows it too…what should I do, I wonder if he will probe me later. I'm sure he will…\nHer head hurts when she starts to think about it. Her stomach hurts as well. Anyway, Monica decided to consider this matter later and moved on to the next issue.\n\"…will this bruise remain for a while?\"\nIn all honesty, Monica wanted Glenn to be the first to be examined first. But for another reason, the servants of the Rehnberg family, as if half-pushing him toward her, had brought Rey to Monica's room. Since they're unable to have a proper conversation with him, why not they bring him to Monica, the same Seven Sages as himself, so they pushed him to her, hoping she might be able to do something about it…\n\"T-Then, could you examine Glenn after this? Glenn's symptoms were much worse than mine. He was afflicted by the curse all over his body.\"\nAt the mention of Glenn's name by Monica, Ray furrowed his brow.\n\"Glenn? …oh, I remember now. The disciple of the Barrier Magician?\"\n\"You know him?\"\n\"I've seen his face before from the distance. His big, loud voice made him stand out very much… But I hate that guy. His tall figure and innocent face tell me that he's loved by everyone, and I bet he's popular with the ladies…\"\nSeeing Ray was about to grumble again, Monica hurriedly persuaded.\n\"Um, please examine Glenn first. He's got really bad symptoms…\"\n\"Don't worry, he should be fine. After all, he has more mana than we do, so his resistance to curses should be higher.\"\n\"…eh?\"\nAs Monica blinked in surprise Ray said, \"You didn't know?\" and looked at her unexpectedly.\n\"Technically, the mana capacity of the disciple of Barrier Magician is over 250, unofficially it is.\"\n\"Eeeh!?\"\nThe average magician's mana capacity was around 100, and the minimum required to become one of the Seven Sages was 150, but Monica's mana capacity was a little over 200.\nAccording to official records, there were only four people in the kingdom who have a mana capacity of over 250. And two of them were from the Seven Sages, the Thorn Witch, and the Artillery Magician.\nSince records of the measuring mana capacity cannot be registered until one becomes an official magician, Glenn's record as an apprentice was still an unofficial record, apparently.\nN-Now that I think about it, a while back in an elective class, Glenn had broken the mana measuring device…\nAt that time, he broke the mana measuring device with an upper limit of 250; in other words, his mana exceeded that of the measuring device.\n\"I-I never know that Glenn was that amazing…\"\n\"Despite having a monster mana capacity, his skill at magic is absolutely terrible, which's why he was entrusted to the Barrier Magician. What I want to say is you don't need to worry about him. I bet he'll be up tomorrow.\"\nJust as Ray said this, a knock came at the door of the room and a servant's voice was heard.\n\"Lady and Lord Seven Sages, I would like to inform you that Master Glenn Dudley has regained his consciousness.\"\n\"See?\" Ray shrugged, looking like he couldn't care less.",

      "content": "\"Ooooowwwww!! It hurts!! It feels worse than the muscle aches I had when my master bring me in hellish training in the mountains.\"\n\"You're a magician but training in the mountain?\"\n\"Owow… You see, when I was beaten up by my master until my muscles ached, he kicked me off from a cliff and told me to come back on my own… well, compared to that time, I can lie down on the bed right now.\"\n\"That didn't sound like you were training your magic,\" responded Felix to Glenn's story, who was laying down on the bed, with a wry smile.\nActually, he wanted to go visit the Silent Witch's room, but he had to restrain himself since she was currently undergoing the Abyssal Shaman's treatment. But when Felix heard Glenn was awake, he immediately went to his room. As for the reason, Felix felt no small guilt for what happened to Glenn as well.\nAfter all, the recent cursed dragon disaster was neither caused by a natural disaster nor by dragon damage, it was a man-made disaster caused by a shaman's curse. And this shaman probably related to Duke Crockford.\nTo solidify Felix's position, the Duke apparently orchestrated a disaster called a cursed dragon, and probably, everyone who knows nothing about it would praise Felix as a person who ended such a disaster. As a result, Glenn caught up in this silly charade, hovering on the edge of life and death.\nBut before Felix could say his gratitude to Glenn, the latter spoke first in a sullen face.\n\"I'm sorry, president.\"\n\"Why are you apologizing to me?\"\n\"I was supposed to be a guard, but I haven't acted like one at all…\"\nNot even the always cheerful young man like him could escape from the depressed feeling.\nHiding the smile that creeped on his face, Felix cast a glance at the door leading to the corridor.\n\"Don't be discouraged. You did a great job… and believe me, I'm not the only one who thinks so.\"\nFelix gave a single wink to Glenn, who was looking at him with a skeptical look. As he silenced the sound of his footsteps while approaching the door, he then opened it suddenly.\n\"Kyaaah!?\"\nEliane yelped as she stumbled into the room. Feeling faltered, she flailed her hand around nonsensically, but to escape from the current situation she looked up at Felix trying to make some excuse.\n\"Well, it's not like I have the slightest intention of eavesdropping, of course. It just happened I was leaning against the door to have some a little rest so…\"\nHearing Eliane spoke more rapidly than usual, Felix placed his hand over his mouth to cover his chuckle.\n\"Of all the doors, why does it has to be Dudley's room I wonder?\"\n\"I, I, I just, I just happened to see you, Lord Felix, and I thought I'd say hello to you… yes, nothing more.\"\nEliane, who had been mumbling incoherently, glanced at Glenn while playing with her skirt for no reason.\n\"G-Good day, Lord Glenn… H-how are you feeling?\"\nIf it were a few minutes ago after he woke up, he would be collapsed instantly if he tried to get up from the bed after feeling a writhing pain in his body. But, contrary to the expectation, he was straightened his upper body energetically and showed her a toothy grin.\n\"I am totally fine now! Ah, maybe I'm a bit hungry. Now I feel like eating some meat!\"\nHearing Glenn's words, Eliane relaxed her eyebrows and released a sigh of relief. But the next moment, she pulled back her exasperated expression and lifted her chin haughtily.\n\"A sick person shouldn't be eating meat.\"\n\"I will have no energy if I don't eat meat!\"\n\"W-Well! It can't be helped then!\"\nWith that said, Eliane quickly turned her back to him… whereas her cheeks were rosy and her mouth was mumbling about something.\nAfter Eliane left the room and just before the door closed, her voice leaked out from the hallway.\n\"Aunty! Aunty! Go prepare some meat dishes for him! Use the best meat we have and make sure to boil it first so it will soften enough when eaten!\"\nOh dear, giggled Felix while looking toward the bed.\nOn the bed, Glenn collapsed after holding his groaning. With his current condition, he probably cannot hear Eliane's voice.\n\"What a gentleman you are, Dudley.\"\nWhen he heard Felix speak teasingly, Glenn lying limply on the bed raised the edge of his lips.\n\"After all, it's not good to make a little kid worry…\"\nFelix almost couldn't hold back his laugh from bursting out.\nApparently, Eliane was not much different from the neighborhood kids in Glenn's eyes.\nWell, I think the talk between Lady Everett and the Abyssal Sorceress should be over by now.\nAfter all, there was something he need to clarify with his idol, the Silent Witch.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"Um… Lord Abyssal Shaman…\"\nAfter being called by Monica, Ray's slanted eyes shifted their direction to Monica.\n\"Just call me Lord Ray… no, it'd be better if you drop the formality. Doesn't being called just by name feel more intimate?\"\n\"But I can't call my respected senior by his name…\"\n\"Respected senior? Oh, it has a nice ring to it. Then, could you say it more intimately?\"\nThe phrase \"respected senior\" seemed to do the trick, but whether he was willing to listen or not remains uncertain.\nMonica wanted him to go to Glenn's room immediately, but she held back since she had something she really wanted to clarify with Ray. So, in sitting posture, she straightened her upper body and asked, \"Lord Abyssal Shaman, is it possible to transform a dragon into a cursed dragon using witchcraft?\"\n\"No, it isn't. Dragons have a terribly high resistance to magic in the first place, so no matter how potent the witchcraft is, humans wouldn't be able to curse an adult dragon. Well, it was another case if it's a young dragon,\" denied Ray plainly and Monica recalled the memories she saw in the midst of intense pain when the curse was eating away at her.\nTo pay revenge to the human who killed its own child, the Green Dragon had eaten its own child along with the curse.\n\"What if… the dragon willingly accepted the curse…?\"\nRay fell silent for a moment and pondered at Monica's words. His purple eyelashes were downcast, casting shadows over his brightly colored eyes.\n\"Are you implying the recent matter of cursed dragon was like that?\"\n\"If you mean the curse that caused by human witchcraft without natural occurrence which affected my arm right now… then, yes.\"\nRay did not immediately dismiss Monica's words because he had diagnosed the bruises on her arms. It was the result of ‘witchcraft'.\n\"This matter would cause a huge uproar if people know the cursed dragon was the handiwork of a shaman.\"\n\"…I also feel that way.\"\nThis case has proven the possibility of a human driving a dragon to go rampage. If this matter becomes public, perhaps it will become a problem that not only affects the kingdom.\nAnd as a shaman himself, the Abyssal Shaman can't overlook this matter.\nIn the Ridill Kingdom, witchcraft is sort of a quasi-prohibited art that cannot be used without the king's permission, mostly used for criminals to prevent them from repeating their crimes and for the purpose of restraining them. As a result, personal use was prohibited with only a few shamans left in the kingdom.\nMost of it was from the members of the Albright family where Abyssal Shaman from, their branches, and a few individuals who were studying the subject.\nThen think about it, what will happen if there's a shaman that can create such a cursed dragon?\nOf course, for Rey himself, the head of the Albright family, this matter can affect the survival of his family.\n\"Lord Abyssal Shaman, um… can we investigate this matter in secret?\"\n\"…are you sure?\"\n\"Y-Yes, I'll lend my hand too…\"\nMonica had her own reasons for choosing not to publicize this cursed dragon matter.\n…I had a hunch that His Highness might know something about the recent ‘cursed dragon' matter.\nNow that she thought about it, Felix had proclaimed that the curse that was consuming the cursed dragon was caused by ‘witchcraft' when Monica arrived on the scene.\nHe probably knew something that Monica did not.\nIt was also suspicious when Felix sneaked out of the mansion in the middle of the night to confront the cursed dragon in the first place. In a normal case, he should have contacted someone from the Reinberg family or his escort, Monica. There was also one more thing that concerned Monica.\nMonica saw some ice magic attack remains on the head of the cursed dragon by the time she arrived at the scene. She deducted it was Felix doing it since he was the only person there.\nDid His Highness cast offensive magic? …but His Highness is…\nFelix had told Monica before, that he was prohibited to study magic, so he was studying in secret. But he did not specifically mention whether or not he could actually use magic.\nDoes he have a reason for not using magic in public? …but then again, there's nothing strange about royalty being able to use magic…\nAnd that proved that Felix was hiding something.\nWell, Monica also kept Nero's identity a secret, so she can't complain about the fact that he was hiding things from her… Nevertheless, she probably needed to have a talk with Felix about it.\nAs Monica secretly thought about this, Ray held Monica's hand.\nIn a surprise, she looked up at Ray's face, his cheeks were rosy and his eyes were glowing with ecstasy.\n\"Um… Lord Abyssal Shaman?\"\n\"I'm touched you're worried about me that much…\"\nFrom Ray's standpoint, Monica's suggestion might have seemed like a concern for his wellbeing as a shaman.\nWith his eyes were slightly moist with emotion, he said, \"Now we know we love each other, this should be mutual love. I'm sure it is. It's so wonderful to have someone falling in love with me…\"\n\"U-Um…\"\nFeeling things would derail in a horrible direction if this continues, Monica exerted all of her meager communication skills to keep the conversation on track.\n\"A-Anyway, we should investigate the matter of the cursed dragon in secret…\"\n\"A secret between two people… a secret relationship has a nice ring to it… as they say, when two people share a secret, their love deepens, doesn't it?\"\nWhen Ray was about to push Monica down, Nero, who had been quiet until now, spoke, \"Hey, since I know this secret, will it also deepen the love between you and me?\"\n\"………\"\nAnd Monica had a thought, I don't care about love or whatnot, just let me get out of this situation.\nPerhaps because heavens had heard Monica's wish, a knock came from the door of her room.\n\"Lady Everett. May I have a moment?\"\nOr not. Apparently, it was too early for her to feel relief since the voice coming from the hallway belonged to Felix.\nAnyway, I need to hear the story from HIs Highness's perspective too…\nNow, this was the critical moment for the Silent Witch to overcome her struggle.",

      "content": "After having Felix wait in the hallway for a while, Monica asked Ray for a favor.\n\"Lord Abyss Shaman, I want you to curse me.\"\nMonica's words made Ray widen his eyes in surprise for a moment, after which he clapped his hands together with a look of understanding.\n\"If strong human emotions and affection can be said as curses as well, then when you say ‘curse me,' I can take that to mean the same thing as ‘love me,' am I right?\"\n\"N-No… I don't mean it like that…\"\nMonica fidgeted as she kneaded her fingers, telling Ray the particulars of the curse she wanted him to cast.\nDespite witchcraft being treated as quasi-prohibited, the kingdom had given its consent to allow the Albright family for using it. As long as it was only a weak curse that meets certain criteria, and they had the consent of the subjected party, they were allowed to use them. However, to actually met someone who asks him to put a curse on herself, was almost none.\nRay seemed to wonder why she asked such a thing, but when Monica repeated \"please,\" he eventually give in and nodded happily.\n\"Okay. Since it's a favor from a junior who adores me, I'll do it for you… but before we begin, I want to make certain. Do you fall in love with me?\"\n\"I r-respect you…\"\n\"Respect… respect, it also can be an adoration… aah… it feels great having someone respects me!\"\nMuttering with a delighted look on his face, Ray placed his pale fingers on Monica's neck. He then trailed his fingers along her skin as if to inscribe a letter, and chanted a short incantation.\nA bright pink light, much like his eyes, flooded from his fingertips, carving a spell formula on Monica's neck. The back of Monica's throat itched painfully as the stinging feel crept like a sizzle.\n\"Okay. Now you're under the curse of ‘Ugly Voice'… its effect would last for an hour.\"\n\"…ThAnK YOu VeRy MuCh.\"\nHer voice sounded so hoarse when she thanked him, almost like a frog forcing itself to speak human words through its vocal cords. After a few vocal exercises, Monica quickly pulled on a hooded robe that she had draped over the back of her chair.\nWhen Ray looked at Monica putting her hood over her eyes, he didn't say anything in particular. After all, Monica always put a downcast look with her hood draped over her face when she attended the Seven Sages' summit, and he was used to it.\n\"LoRd AbYss ShAmAn, I hAvE sOmEthIng I nEEd to discUss wiTh HIs HIgHhness in pRivAte, If you wOuLd eXcUse uS…\"\nThough in a roundabout way, the message she wanted to convey was she wished him to leave this room, but it made Ray wrinkle the bridge of his nose.\n\"Ah, I knew it… I guess all women love princes… sure enough, he's the most handsome guy among the three royal brothers, with blond hair and blue eyes… naturally, people would love him…\"\n\"I-It's nOt lIkE thAt… I ActUally hAd sOmEthIng imPorTant to dIScusS wIth hIm…\"\n\"Enough with this charade, just get this guy out of here already.\"\nNero said spitefully, grabbing Ray who was grumbling bitterly by the neck before opening the door.\nHe then shoved Felix, who was standing on the other side of the door, out of the way with a \"polite\" excuse and threw Ray out into the hallway. His behavior showed no respect for either Felix or Ray.\n\"Okay, now we have clean all the mess. You can come in, prince.\"\n\"…then, if you would excuse me.\"\nFelix was bewildered when looking at Ray thrown out of the room, but he still stepped into the room.\nOnce he went inside, Nero quickly closed and locked the door. After which, Monica bowed to Felix and said, \"ThaNk yOu foR taKing tHe TiMe to vIsiT uS, Your Highness.\"\nFelix appeared startled by her croaky, ugly voice.\n\"The reAson I kePT my MOUth ShuT UNTil noW was BeCause my vOIcE sOunds unPLeAsAnt To LiStEN To.

I HoPE yoU CaN FoRGIvE me foR mAKinG YOU UnComfOrTABLE WitH tHis UglY voIcE.\"\nMonica slowly minced her words, telling herself not to stutter over and over.\nFelix seemed hardly able to hide his surprise, but he did not frown uncomfortably. His usually calm face was laced with just a hint of pain, and he looked at Monica's left hand.\n\"How are you feeling, Lady Everett? Does your left hand… still hurt?\"\n\"… aS LOng As I DON'T moVe It, IT WOn't BE A ProbLem.\"\n\"You don't have to force yourself to get up, Lady Everett. If it's too hard for you, please lie down on the bed…\"\nAs if to interrupt Felix, Monica shook her head.\n\"No NEed. ThEre're mOre presSIng mAtters we nEed To taLk aBouT.\"\nWith that, Monica offered him a chair, and Felix, with a smooth pace, offered the chair in front of him to her instead.\n\"Please have a seat.\"\nEven his manner to escort women come off naturally in these situations.\nAfter Monica sat awkwardly on her chair, Felix sat down across from her. While Nero stood behind Monica, arms folded while looking menacingly at Felix.\nAfter looking at Nero with a wry smile, Felix opened his mouth.\n\"There are many things I would like to talk to you, Lady Everett… but may I start by asking you about\nhim\n?\"She had expected him to ask about him. So, while Monica was choosing her words to answer him, Nero snorted proudly.\n\"You want to know about me? Fine, I'll tell you. My favorite food is chicken and cheese. And my favorite novelist is Dustin Gunter.\"\n\"…I'm not referring to your personal preferences, but the circumstances of you becoming Lady Everett's familiar. I want to know how did you have this kind of relationship with her… If we're looking back, I can say you were the one who led the wyverns to attack Kerbeck County.\"\nAt Felix's words, Nero's brow wrinkled deeply and his lip parted, ‘Huh?' letting out a small, mocking sound.\n\"When have I ever attacked a human before? Are you serious? …wait, what's the term for this kind of thing? Oh, yes, false accusation. That was a false accusation! Let me tell you, I don't have any connection with those wyverns.\"\n\"…so it just misunderstanding?\"\nNero snorted fumingly at the confused Felix and nodded.\n\"I was originally living in the mountains of the Empire's domain. But when things got too noisy with all the development things, I decided to roam around looking for a new place to live… umm, what was it called? The Wogan Mountains? Anyway, when I was living there, all those young wyverns begin to worship me and treat me like their boss.\"\nWyverns are particularly unintelligent creatures and belong to the dragon race in the lower species. Even though they were the same species as a dragon, the difference in their intelligence was akin to that between a man and a dog.\nBasically, wyverns can follow simple commands from higher species but have difficulty in making precise communication.\n\"Apparently, some young wyverns got carried away and attacked humans and their livestock, while the truth I didn't give them any such order.\"\n\"…then how did you and Lady Everett end up in a master-servant relationship?\"\nMonica pondered over Felix's question.\nI-I wonder if I should tell him about this as well…\nContrary to Monica's troubled expression, Nero answered in an easy-going manner.\n\"It just happened when I ate some random wild bird, its bone stuck in my throat.\"\n\"Uh-huh.\"\n\"It hurt so bad, and then this guy pulled it out for me.\"\n\"…that's it?\"\n\"That's it.\"\nIndeed, it was actually all just that, nothing more.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAfter Monica defeated all the twenty wyverns, she proceeded deeper through the forest into the mountains. There, she saw a single Black Dragon laying down while growling in displeasure.\nAll Monica had to do was cast offensive magic to attack its forehead and her mission to subjugate the Black Dragon would be completed… or so she was supposed to. But, when she heard its growling, she recognized that it had used the same language that spirits used.\nBecause she had taken the spirit language course at Minerva, she could comprehend some of its words. It said:\n——It hurts.\nWhen she heard such words, Monica couldn't help but ask the dragon a question.\n\"…by any chance… are you in trouble?\"\nFor the anti-social Monica, talking to a dragon, even if it was a legendary Black Dragon, was much more comfortable than talking to a human. (She herself might not aware of this, but Louis considers this strangeness as abnormal).\n——Something, is stuck in my throat, it hurts.\n\"…throat? I see… if you don't mind… could you open your mouth…\"\nStill lying down, the dragon followed Monica's words and opened its big mouth.\nEach of its fangs was sharp like a spear, and its red tongue was so long that it could easily entangle Monica'd body easily.\nBut Monica paid no attention to the Black Dragon's tongue, only remembering that it was not toxic, so she climbed up its jaw and entered its mouth.\nOnly an insane person would think of entering the black dragon's mouth on her own conscious.\nAccording to Louis Miller, only an ‘oddball' like Monica would find being inside the dragon's mouth was far less frightening than being surrounded by people.\nCrawling on all fours, Monica was proceeding forward on the dragon's tongue. There, she saw a white sharp thing stuck in the back of its throat. It was probably an animal bone.\n\"…I will try to pull this out… please endure it for a while…\"\nGrabbing it with both of her hands, she pulled it with all of her strength. As a result, the Black Dragon's throat was growling, making Monica fall on her butt after losing her balance.\n\"Hinyaaaaaaa!?\"\nAfterward, the Black Dragon spit out Monica covered in saliva from its mouth, leaving her plopped down on the ground with her eyes swirling. The Black Dragon looked up to the sky, and in the next moment, its body was covered with black mist.\nFrom the tips of its finger, toes, and hair, the mist was condensed as if taking the shape of a human being.\nEventually, the Black Dragon transformed into a black-haired man in an archaic robe with mystical golden eyes. He then looked at Monica and said, \"Ah, feels much better! I've got a bone stuck in my throat after eating some bird meat. I was planning to burn it with my black flames, but it just happened stuck in a tricky spot. And as you can see, I can't burn it with my flames.\"\nThe dignity and mysterious atmosphere disappeared after the man spoke so fluently in human language. If you remove his old robes, he might just be a friendly neighbor dude you could find anywhere.\nMonica would prefer to talk with a dragon, but even with all these thoughts. The fear of humans still made Monica frightened, especially men with large stature.\nAs Monica remained prone on the ground stiffly, the dragon in human form crouched down in front of Monica and made eye contact with her.\n\"What? Are you too frightened by my imposing figure?\"\n\"A…..h….\"\n\"Why did you more frightened when I am in human form? Doesn't I look handsome right now?\"\n\"…ah… umm…\"\nThe Black Dragon was scratching his head in trouble when looking at Monica sniffling almost in tears.\n\"Oh, I remember, a female human likes might like… this!\"\nHis human form transformed again into mist before it compressed into a small form.\nAs the shape became clearer and the mist dispersed, a small cat appeared.\n\"Hey, human females like a cute cat, right? Look at this paw, it feels soft to touch. Meow, meow.\"\nNow standing before her was a black cat poking his paw on her cheeks. The realization had made Monica relax a little.\nPerhaps, he was not transforming completely into a cat, because when he's in a dragon form he can't speak human fluently, but now he can in a cat form. As for what was certain, it had a different vocal cord from a normal cat.\nWhile these thoughts ran in her mind, the black cat wagged his tail and said to her, \"now, have you calmed down?\" to which she responded by nodding in relief.\n\"So, what are you human doing here? Are you lost?\"\n\"Um… well…\"\nMonica, who had been prone on the ground, sluggishly raised her upper body to sit down, before fidgeting with her fingers.\n\"C-Could you please get out of this mountain… The people at the foothills v-very scared of you…\"\n\"Now that you mention it. I remember many people had come up here from the foothills. So you were targetting my life, huh?\"\n\"W-Well… you could say I was…\"\nThe black cat gave an exasperated look when Monica honestly revealed her motive.\n\"You really are an idiot. And you know what, If I were in my original form, my black flames would had burn you long ago without leaving any bones to remain.\"\n\"I-I think… I will have defeated you… before it happens…\"\nWith that said, Monica pointed her finger at a random tree and that tree turned into ice instantly.\nThat spectacle widened the black cat's golden eyes in surprise. Monica continued fidgeting her fingers and said, \"Your flame takes a lot of time to cast… I could defeat you before you breathed your flame… I think.\"\n\"Why did you help me then?\"\n\"Huh? Um… it was because you looked so painful…\"\nThe black cat looked exasperated when hearing Monica's answer. For a cat, he sure can be so expressive.\n\"You really an oddball.\"\n\"..auuu…\" *stab*\nAs sad as it is, she was often called \"oddball\" by her uncle. Especially when she was still with him, he always abused her while scolding that word daily.\nAs Monica cast her eyes downheartedly, the black cat dexterously stood on two legs and placed his foreleg on his chin, just like a human would do.\n\"You were not afraid of entering the mouth of the Black Dragon, but you are afraid of humans…you are a strange one, aren't you? I like interesting people. And you are such an interesting one.\"\n\"Uh-huh…\"\n\"I decided. I'll let you keep me as your pet.\"\nMonica was silent for a good few seconds, and after carefully assessing the black cat's statement, she let out an absentminded, \"…what?\"\nTo which, the black cat triumphantly responded, \"You want me to leave this mountain, don't you?\"\n\"Y-Yes.\"\n\"But after I've been driven out of my home by humans without any reason I got no place to go anymore. Don't you find how pitiful my life is?\"\n\"I-I do.\"\n\"That's why, as the person who is responsible for driving me away from this place, I want you to take me as your pet.\"\nAs perplexed as she was, the words he uttered were like a person trying to coax her.\nBut considering how timid was her personality, expecting Monica to reject his request was a tall order.\nSo after he received uncomprehended answers like ‘ah… um…' repeatedly, the black cat jumped onto Monica's shoulder and tapped his soft paw on her cheek.\n\"I tell you, a dragon only submits to the stronger ones, and you\nare\nstronger than me. So you should be proud of yourself.\"\nAnd Monica wondered while being tapped by his paw if the definition of ‘submissive' between a human and a dragon this time might be meant the otherwise.",

      "content": "Felix, upon hearing Nero's explanation, was as calm with his never-changing smile. Though, his bewilderment was palpable.\n\"I heard that the Black Dragon Wogan was making eerie noises at night deep in the mountains…\"\n\"Oh, I've got a sore throat back then.\"\n\"It was not for commanding wyverns?\"\n\"It was my scream of ‘Aaaaarrgh, it's huuuuurtss!'. Ever since that time, I vowed to never eat birds alive again.\"\n\"……….\"\nHis smiling face was still there but Felix was bewildered. More so after hearing the continuation of his story. Even Monica who was listening beside him couldn't bear to hear it anymore.\nFrom this story, he discovered that the Silent Witch did not drive the Black Dragon Wogan away. In fact, she only pulled out the stuck bone from its throat.\nPerhaps Felix would be disappointed with the Silent Witch after this. After all, she was the person he adores most.\n\"…ARE yoU DIsaPPOInTEd?\"\nFelix shook his head at Monica's question.\n\"Not at all. If you consider it from another perspective, not just anyone could help the Black Dragon and made him his familiar. It won't change my respect toward you… though my impression of the dragon might change a bit.\"\n\"Now, had your impression of the dragon increased?\"\nLooking at Nero's proud expression, Felix had a thought, ‘I guess a dragon can be sloppy too,' and his impression of the dragon might lean more toward this thought.\nExpressing his wry smile, Felix asked Nero.\n\"…let me ask you, do you plan to harm humans?\"\n\"No. I don't have any interest in humans.\"\nHis answer sounded indifferent for a dragon who had driven away from his home. Perhaps he was just an easy-going person.\nAlthough he said he had no interest in humans, he seemed so engrossed with human culture and arts. Especially with Dustin Gunter's works.\n\"Just to make sure… can you use your black flame in human form?\"\nBlack Flame was the strongest black-colored flame the Black Dragon breathes out. It can burn any witchcraft and barriers without any resistance.\nAccording to history, a few hundred years ago, there were a very small number of magicians who could manipulate Black Flame, but in the present day, there simply are none, and Black Flame is treated as a first-class forbidden spell which its severity could rival ‘resurrection' and ‘weather manipulation' if it used.\nHe couldn't leave him alone if Nero could use such flames even in his human form. But, since he shook his head and denied it instantly, it meant he can't.\n\"I only can use Black Flame in my original form. I mean, if I can use it in my human form, I would have secretly used it a long ago.\"\n\"Indeed…\"\nNero was telling truth. While he was physically strong in human form, he will lose his ability to fly, let alone use black flame.\nPerhaps satisfied with his answer, he let out a brief sigh of relief and smiled at the anxious Monica.\n\"Please rest assured, Lady Everett. I will tell this story to no one. I will keep this secret only between us.\"\n\"…tHaNk You…\"\nFelix relaxed his eyes when he heard Monica's awkward thanks.\nAt the very least, Monica had resolved one of her problems. After all, she wanted to keep Nero's secret in the dark, so when she heard his assurance she patted her chest in relief.\nBut their discussion was far from finished. Now, it was Monica's turn to ask.\n\"I also hAVe A quEStIon I wOUlD lIKE tO aSk yOu, yOUr hIghneSS.\"\n\"Is this about last night's incident?\"\nMonica nodded curtly. She was wondering why Felix wanted to resolve the curse dragon incident alone, to even had snuck out of the mansion last night.\nBut, before Monica voiced her question, Felix began to narrate his story.\n\"I've been feeling very uneasy last night. I've been questioning myself: Did my rifle actually pierce the forehead of the legendary cursed dragon and defeated it? As a cowardly person as I am, such thoughts have been running over in my head, and so I decided to secretly check it out myself. But I found out the cursed dragon had moved again, the story became what you had known where I confronted the dragon myself. Because of my arbitrary action, I've made you injured… I'm sincerely sorry for that.\"\n\"wHY diD You nOT ask Me or PeOPLe OF The DukE… tO Help You?\"\n\"I don't want people to think of me as a coward person, so I can't ask ‘I feel something not right with the cursed dragon, let's check it out together'. But my vanity has blinded my decision, as a result, many people were injured, and I regretted it.\"\nHer intuition told her it was a lie. But Monica lacked evidence to support her claim.\nMonica decided to play the only remaining hand she had.\n\"THEn… what maDE yoU certAin thAt tHe cuRSED DragOn WaS not a nATUrAL OccURRed pHenOmeNoN BUt a Man-maDe ONE uSing witchcrAft?\"\nThat night Felix had told her,\n——Someone has cast ‘witchcraft’ on it. Perhaps a ‘witchcraft tool’ was placed somewhere in its body.\nSo why Felix was so certain it was witchcraft when even the Seven Sages like Monica couldn't tell the difference between a natural curse and witchcraft?\nWith his usual smile, Felix answered Monica's question.\n\"I'm sorry if my words back then had made you misunderstand. Actually, I was not sure whether it was witchcraft or not. My experience of observing many convicts being subjected to witchcraft had told me so… that's what drove me to make that conclusion.\"\nHe lied again. Monica was sure those words were not coming from his assumption, but a fact that he had known the thing that eating away the cursed dragon was witchcraft.\nNot satisfied with his answer, Monica tried to find another way to pry.\n\"…THen, WHat ABOuT THe iCE MaGic tRAcE I FoUnD On ThE cUrsed draGoN'S foReHead? WAs IT your DoiNG, yOUr higHNeSS?\"\n\"It was the after-effects of bullets imbued with ice magic. I left it behind during the day because I thought we were only going to hunt… I would have brought it along If I know that incident was going to happen.\"\nPerhaps Felix had anticipated Monica's possible question and prepared his answers in advance. The way he answered the question without pause only make it more like he tried to cover the truth.\n…and Monica can't force the royal family to talk and pursue the matter further.\n\"I tHank yOU fOR CLEaRing My DoUbtS, yOuR higHNEsS.\"\nShe might didn't get the answer she wanted but she thanked him anyway, to which Felix replied with his usual warm smile.\nHowever, the light of his beautiful blue eyes looked hollow like a bottomless pit. And Monica couldn't help but gulp at the sight.\nHe didn't look like put any pressure when smiling, but… for some reason she felt intimidated when looking at it.\nSo, Monica clenched the almost tremble fist inside her sleeve before asking him the last question.\n\"…TheN, I HopE YoU Could aNsweR mY LAST queStioN.\"\n\"What would it be, Lady Everett?\"\n\"HOw MUCH do YOu KnoW ABouT THe [CONCH flame] inCIDeNT, youR hiGHNEss?\"\nRight after they arrived at this mansion, Felix told her.\n——I knew it, you’re the person who saved Cyril from the outburst… and also saved me from the [Conch Flame].\nFelix might aware of his assassination attempt during the [Conch Flame] incident.\nApart from Monica and Nero, the only people who knew the details of that incident were Louis, Lynn, and the culprit herself, Casey. And lastly was her father.\nHow much does His Highness know about the incident? Did he realize… Casey was the culprit?\nIf that was the case, Casey, as the person who was responsible for her attempt to assassinate Felix, would be dragged out and executed without question.\nAnd I don't want that to happen…\nHer cold sweats were flowing profusely on her clenching hands and her heart was thumping loudly.\nHowever, despite her nervousness, Felix answered her question lightly.\n\"Nothing very much. I only know that you have saved me from that [Conch Flame].\"\nIf he were telling the truth, it meant Felix was unaware of Casey's involvement.\nFeeling relieved, Monica patted her chest in her mind. To which Felix smiled and said.\n\"I also have a question for you. I learned you were involved with Cyril's outburst and [Conch Flame] incident.\"\nAlarmed at his words, Monica's shoulders trembled under her robe, but unable to read her current state, Felix fixed his gaze on her.\n\"Could it be… you are a faculty member of Serendia Academy, Lady Everett?\"\nMonica's heartbeat almost burst out at those words.\n\"…N-NO, I'm not. i Just\nCoINCIdEnTLY\nhApPENEd TO bE thERe whEN bOTh INcideNTs HappEnEd.\"\n\"I see… I really can't thank you enough for what you have done for me. Not only did you protect me from the [Conch Flame], but you also saved the treasurer of our student council.\"\n\"But, ISN't He…\"\nMonica covered her mouth in pale after realizing she had let out a doubtful remark involuntarily.\nBut it was too late.\nOh no, I've done it…\nContrary to Monica's nervous state, Felix remained calm with his warm smile plastered on his face and continued with his words.\n\"Oh, pardon me. I made a mistake. Cyril's our vice president, not the treasurer.\"\nCyril was the vice president of the student council at Serendia Academy. And everyone who attends there knows about it.\nBut for an outsider like her—much less if she were the Silent Witch who should have not any connection there—should have not known this fact.\nBut, she reacted when he stated he gave that false information, and it had given her away.\nHe figured it out! He realized that the Silent Witch was at Serendia Academy!\nFelix didn't try to pursue the matter further. However, he definitely noticed.\nHis blue eyes which were outlined by the golden long eyelashes were looking at Monica with unconcealed happiness.\n\"I guess I shouldn't have kept the sick person chatting with me. I hope your left-hand recovers soon. Then, if you would excuse me.\"\n\"………\"\nUnable to reply, Monica could only keep silent while hanging her head low.",

      "content": "After Felix excused himself from the room, Monica stood up wobbly then plopped down on the bed, buried her face in the pillow, and let out a muffled \"aaAaAahhhhhhHH\" whine. It continued until the curse's effects on her throat wore off, the itchiness in her throat went away and her voice returned to normal.\nAfterward, she whined, \"I-It's all oveeer for me… Aaaaaahh… I'm so stupid, stupid, stupiiiiid\" in grief.\nNero, not entirely understanding the situation, turned his head to Monica, who was huddled like a caterpillar on the bed.\n\"Okay, so what does that have to do with it?\"\n\"His Highness Felix realized it! The Silent Witch, which is me, was connected to the Serendia Academy!\"\n\"H-He what!?\"\nIf she know it would end like this, she shouldn't have made a poor attempt to probe him and touch the Conch Flame matter… and now she really regretted it.\nShe should have realized it beforehand. With her horrible communication, gaining an advantage over the discussion with a diplomat like Felix would be impractical.\n\"Uuuuuuu… On the other hand, he had made me spill my secret.\"\nPerhaps, after the winter break, Felix might have started to look for the Silent Witch's whereabouts around the school.\nWith almost six months left before her escort mission is over, this incident had made her think frantically about her next move.\n\"Furthermore, I haven't asked him questions like: why was Your Highness quite knowledgeable about the witchcraft?; Or is Your Highness by any chance able to use magic?\"\nEven with all the questions she had asked, everything was answered with lies.\nLooking at the depressed Monica, Nero said to her with a nonchalant voice.\n\"Maybe we can think all of them were related to the prince's contracted spirit. If we're talking about his contracted spirit's knowledge of witchcraft, he might be quite knowledgeable. And he should have a few spells to attack in his sleeve.\"\n\"………\"\nUnable to follow Nero's words, Monica fell silent for a moment. She then sluggishly got up from the bed before turning her gaze to Nero.\n\"What do you mean by His Highness' contracted spirit?\"\n\"I'd told you before. I think the white lizard I saw crawling over the prince was his water spirit, a high-ranking at that.\"\n\"Hold on, hold on, hold on…\"\nShe had never heard that Felix had a contracted spirit. However, she had a faint recollection that Nero had told her about the lizard.\nI think I remember Nero talking about His Highness trying to use a lizard to probe him, but it was trailed off in the middle…\nSince high-ranking spirits can use magic, it should enable him to confront the cursed dragon.\nBut Nero's words mentioning Felix had formed a contract with a high-ranking water spirit only made her doubts begin to surface.\n\"You said Felix has formed a contract with a high-ranking water spirit… but it shouldn't be possible.\"\n\"Why is not possible? I mean, look at that wicked Lololo Lowlowis, he was able to form a contract with a high-ranking wind spirit.\"\n\"But he needs a huge mana capacity to do that. There's also the matter of their affinity…\"\nThe minimum mana capacity required to become one of the Seven Sages is 150, and the necessary mana capacity to form a contract with a high-ranking spirit is not much different from it.\nForming a contract with a spirit can be extremely dangerous. It was not uncommon for a magician with a small mana capacity to lose all his or her mana and die after performing such a ritual. That's why, among so many magicians in the kingdom, there are only ten or so people who were able to form a contract with a high-ranking spirit.\nFelix clearly possesses a good head on his shoulders, and judging from the quality of his finished thesis, he should be able to perform the ritual of summoning a high-ranking spirit if he consolidates on his research. However, he needs to have a tremendous mana capacity before he can successfully perform that ritual.\n\"…Nero, do you think His Highness has a huge mana capacity?\"\n\"Hmm~ If we're talking about the mana capacity between humans, I don't think they possess any different from each other. But, if it were the chilly guy and the loud boy, I can tell them apart easily.\"\nNero's sensing ability can deduce a person's mana capacity but it only tells him vaguely, not the accurate number, so it's best for her not to rely on it.\nLet's say Felix had the required mana capacity to be a high-ranking magician, even then, he still had to meet another requirement before he was able to summon the high-ranking spirit.\n\"Before a magician can summon and form a contract with a high-ranking spirit, they had to have the same affinity with the summoned spirit. Take Louis as an example, since his highest element affinity is wind, he was able to form a contract with a high-ranking wind spirit.\"\nOn the other hand, since Monica's highest element affinity was wind, she was able to summon the Spirit King of Wind. However, she can't summon any spirits other than the Spirit King of the Wind.\n\"Then, does it mean his highest element affinity is water?\"\n\"Perhaps his highest element affinity is earth…\"\nNero tilted his head when hearing Monica speaking unconfidently.\n\"How can you tell when you'd never seen him using any magic?\"\n\"I can tell from his middle name, Ark.\"\nIn this kingdom, there was a particular tradition where parents would give their children a middle name of the Spirit King related to their highest element affinity in hoping to have its blessing.\nFor example, Neil's full name. There was a word \"Clay\" in \"Neil Clay Maywood\". And his middle name was derived from the name of the Spirit King of the Earth, Arklaid.\n\"Talking about a middle name, the word ‘Ark' in his name came up from the name of the Spirit King of Earth, and it can tell us that he has an affinity with the earth element. As for forming a contract with a high-ranking water spirit, it should be impossible for him…\"\n\"I can't really tell anything about it, but what if his affinity changed in his growth?\"\n\"According to research, one's affinity is inherited from either both parents, and it would never change even after he/she grows up.\"\nMany studies, including his late father's, had proved that there was a genetic factor involved in mana. Even her father's book that she brought from Porter's Antiquarian Bookstore mentioned this.\n\"Hmm… Hmmmmm… Even after that explanation, I still don't understand. So what does it basically means?\"\n\"Basically, no matter what happens, an earth dragon won't turn into a water dragon.\"\n\"Oh, nyow I understand.\"\nNodding in understanding, Nero rubbed his chin and tilted his head.\n\"Then, what if he just happened to have a middle name that has nothing to do with his affinity?\"\n\"…I don't think a royal family would give a middle name to their children that had no relation with their highest element affinity.\"\n\"Well, maybe he was the rare case.\"\nNero might have disregarded it since a name was not particularly meaningful to him, but it was not for Monica. She can't erase this uncomfortable feeling from her mind.\nMaybe the reason His Highness can't use magic in public has something to do with that…\nThrough the recent incidents, Monica's doubts and discomfort with Felix were slowly beginning to build up in her mind.\nHis unnatural attitude toward the cursed dragon.\nHis reason for keeping his high-ranking spirit in the dark.\nAnd lastly… his obsession with the throne.\nBut, what would happen if she try to satisfy her curiosity by delving into it?\nPerhaps, this matter is something that I shouldn't touch…\nIt was the thoughts that running in Monica's mind at that time.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAfter Felix left the Silent Witch's room, he stopped his step when he saw a man sitting in the hallway corner hugging his knees.\nThe man wore the same dark blue robe as the Silent Witch, which only the Seven Sages are allowed to wear. A purple hair, which is uncommon in this world, peeked out from his hood.\nThe man was Ray Albright, the Abyssal Shaman, one of the Seven Sages.\nFelix had assumed he had gone to Glenn's room to treat his injury, but what was he doing in the corner of the hallway?\n\"…I want to be loved, I want to be loved so badly and be told that she only needs me alone. I want to be loved, I want to be loved, I want to be loved…\"\n\"The usual thing, huh,\" Felix thought in his mind. He had witnessed this on several occasions when Ray tried to woo the maids in the castle. So he lightly tapped his shoulder.\n\"Excuse me, I presume you are the Abyssal Shaman, Lord Albright. You didn't look well, are you alright?\"\nEven though he knew Ray was fine, he still showed his concern warmly. In response, Ray slowly raised his head and looked up at him… only to find him covering his eyes with both of his hands.\n\"Ugh, his royal aura is crushing me…\"\nHearing such a response, he ignored 90% of his words.\n\"From your response, you seem to be alright. In that case, I would like you to go to Dudley's room to examine his injury…\"\n\"…Okay. I will go…\"\nRay Albright was a man who would say \"do you love me?\" to women and speaks curtly to men.\nThe man himself didn't intend to fix his way of speaking toward the royal family. But even after knowing this fact, the king still appointed this man as one of the Seven Sages.\nAfter getting up from his position, Ray walked down the hallway wobbly like a sick person… but he stopped his steps and turned his head back.\n\"…where's Glenn Dudley's room?\"\n\"If it's okay with me, I could take you to his room.\"\nIf he wants he could make the servants guide the Abyssal Shaman to Dudley's room but Felix didn't do so since he had a few questions he wanted to ask him.\nFelix was walking ahead, while Ray was trailing behind at a certain distance.\nFeeling a strong depressing gaze from behind, Felix decided to start a small talk.\n\"I have to thank you for coming to our help this time. After all, it feels reassuring to have an expert in curses like you here.\"\n\"…there's Miss Silent Witch as well.\"\n\"Of course, I am so grateful to receive her help as well. If it were not for her barrier, I would have died a long ago. And thanks to her too we were able to confront and survive against the cursed dragon.\"\nIn fact, if she were not there at that time, everyone in the hunting ground would definitely have been wiped out. And right now, the cursed dragon would have continued its rampage in the duchy Reinberg while spreading its curse, leaving nothing within in its trail.\n\"I know my knowledge of the curse is limited, but I would like to ask your opinion as an expert on this subject… is it possible to control a living creature at will through witchcraft?\"\n\"…what you're asking was far from the essence of the witchcraft.\"\nFelix stopped his steps and looked behind.\nThe jewel-like eyes of the Abyssal Shaman behind his long bang were gleaming, looking at Felix with somewhat disdain.\n\"…Witchcraft isn't created for ‘controlling' living creatures, it was to make them suffer. If you want to control a living creature, use a mental manipulation spell instead.\"\n\"It's as you said…\"\n\"If there's someone who tries to manipulate living creatures through witchcraft, he must be a disgrace among the shamans and a trashy one at that.\"\nTo common people, manipulating and tormenting others were equally horrible things, but in the eyes of these shamans, they seemed so different apart.\n…he was using this kind of power to raise the prince's status to a higher standing.\nThe road Duke Crockford has prepared for Felix Ark Ridill was a bloody one that was painted with numerous sacrifices.\nAnd he was aware that had no longer had any choice but to walk through all of it.\nJust wait a little more… ‘Ark'\nAuthor Note:\nNero: I'd told you about the lizard!

      "content": "During his stay at Duke Reinberg's residence, Nero had gained another hobby to pass time. It was a wonderful bath time.\nSpeaking of baths, the first thing that crossed one mind when talking about baths in rural areas would be steaming baths, but in cities where bathtub-style bath culture had been established relatively well, one would think of public bathhouses and the like. Naturally, nobles had their own bathing facilities in their residence, and having luxurious bathhouses can be a symbol of their status.\nAnd the bath in Duke Reinberg's residence was no exception to this rule as they have one which was extremely luxurious.\nAt first, Nero was unable to understand what was so great about bath culture, but after timidly submerging in the bathtub he was completely captivated by it.\nSince nobles often took a bath early in the morning before getting ready, Nero always went to the bathhouse at night so he can occupy the bathtub for himself alone.\nAnd today was no exception. Even after he's done with his dinner, he instantly rushed to the bathhouse. He might have a human figure, but his true form was a dragon that was weak to cold. As the snow had been falling continuously for a few days during this season, taking a warming bath must be a blissful time for him.\nWho would have thought that the feared Black Dragon Wogan would be so excited to be taking a bath?\n…And if I think about it, every time Nero took a bath, it would take longer than the last…\nIt takes a lot of labor to maintain the bath, including reheating and cleaning it. The servants may feel inconvenienced if he takes a bath too long.\nReminding herself that she should finish her report at the appropriate point, Monica faced the paper and was preparing herself to write. As for which, it would be delivered to the capital.\nAs the Seven Sages, Monica had an obligation to write a report about the appearance of the cursed dragon and its defeat.\nWithout mentioning that the Green Dragon became a cursed dragon through witchcraft, Monica described her accidental encounter with a cursed dragon at a hunting ground and how she fought it off with Felix's cooperation.\n…and lastly, I need to figure out how to make them convinced that the cursed dragon corpse is not in the hunting ground…\nBesides Monica, Nero, and Felix, nobody had known that the cursed dragon had been moving again in the middle of the night. She thought that it would be better to keep it under wraps. And Felix would not go out of his way to mention that the cursed dragon had been moving in the middle of the night since he didn't want anyone to know that he snuck out of the mansion at that time.\nSince its corpse was burned away without leaving anything by Nero's black flame, no one should have noticed that the cursed dragon had moved.\nAs for her injury, she described it as she was not realized that there was a curse in her injury during the day and it worsened some times later.\n\" …' sometime later, its corpse vanished. I suspect it was disintegrated due to the curse that had eaten away its body, ‘… I guess it will do for now.\"\nDipping her quill into the inkwell, Monica wondered if she should add a few more details about the cursed dragon, and noticed that the inkwell was almost empty. Need to replace it with the new one.\nSo with an empty inkwell in her hand, Monica was about to go out into the hallway looking for a servant. Fortunately, just as Monica opened the door, Peter, a servant in his prime age, passed by.\n\"…Oh, Lady Silent Witch, is there something troubling you?\"\nPeter was a competent servant. He could tell Monica was looking for a servant just by observing Monica's restless gaze under the hood.\nWhen she showed him an empty inkwell, he instantly understood her intention and accepted the empty bottle.\n\"We are very sorry for the inconvenience. We will immediately prepare a new one for you.\"\nPeter said with a respectful bowing posture which had been polished really well for a servant.\nLooking at his gesture, something tugged at Monica's heart.\n………wait.\nShe seemed to remember to have seen him somewhere. And she was sure it was not in this mansion.\nWhere? Where is it? I think it was neither outside the mansion nor the hunting ground… but at some different place…\nMonica has seen this man inside the deep of the forest.\n───No, it was not Monica who has seen this man inside the forest.\n\"─!?\"\nWhen she finally realized that ‘certain truth,' Peter had turned his back on Monica and was walking down the hallway to get some new ink.\nAnd her left hand, as if reacting to the resurfaced memories, was trembling. Holding her trembling hand with her right hand with a grim face, Monica returned to her room.\nPerhaps it was just her imagination, but she felt like she heard a maddening cry in her mind.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"Lady Silent Witch, I've brought you a new inkwell.\"\nIt didn't take long for Peter to return. Monica sat up on her bed and turned her gaze toward the writing desk, and Peter, as if he had known her intention, placed the inkwell on the desk.\n\"Is there anything else?\"\nHearing Peter's words, Monica slowly got up from her bed and locked the door of her room.\n\"Lady…?\"\nPeter asked her with a bewildered expression.\n\"From what I know, Miss Eliane Hyatt and you were the first people who witnessed the cursed dragon.\"\nPeter was probably surprised to hear Monica talk to him. After all, she had hardly spoken to anyone ever since she arrived in this mansion.\nPeter startled before nodding nervously.\n\"I-It was as you said… I was saved by Lord Dudley when I encountered the cursed dragon…\"\n\"And when the cursed dragon appeared in the rest area of the hunting ground, it just happened that you were also there.\"\n\"Y-Yes. I was taking refuge there with Lady Eliane.\"\n\"And lastly, I don't know if you're aware of this or not, but when the cursed dragon was moving again, it was running toward here as if it was attracted by the curse in this mansion.\"\nThe words she uttered didn't stammer like usual.\nIn fact, her fear of humans was dominated by other emotions.\nAnd she knew it was not her.\n──It was coming from the cursed dragon.\n\"Perhaps that Green Dragon was… no, I'm certain you were the one who put a curse on the child of that Green Dragon through witchcraft. That's why that dragon was chasing after you.\"\nBloods drain from Peter's face.\nHis lips trembled as he tried to keep up appearances as a servant.\nThen with his persistent polite demeanor, he asked Monica.\n\"What are you suddenly talking about, Lady Silent Witch… There's no way such I could cast such witchcraft…\"\n\"Perhaps you had known this, but a human body is made up of a boundless number.\"\nAs if being whipped, Peter's body trembled when he heard the words Monica uttered.\nHis eyes that looked at Monica widened to their limits as if he were seeing something unbelievable.\n\"I've seen the memory of that cursed dragon. In that memory, I saw the man who cursed and killed the child of that dragon.\"\nShe couldn't see the face of that man but she saw the shape of his body.\n\"I am confident in my ability to accurately determine the size of the human body. I can surely say that the size of the man that the dragon saw and the size of your body… match perfectly.\"\nThe size of his shoes, the size of his knees, the size of his inseam, the size of his torso, the size of his arms, the size of his fingers, the size of his neck- and lastly the size of his overall proportion.\nMonica was slowly lifting her hood as she surveyed Peter's body size.\nShe saw the numbers of this man matched with the man in the cursed dragon's memory.\nAfter her hood was lifted, the face behind which was surveying Peter's body was exposed.\nIt was a face of a young girl with a childlike appearance──the moment he saw her face, Peter's expression changed completely.\n\"Y-You! You! You…!\"\nWhy did he so scared when seeing my face\n, thought Monica.\nAnd looking at how he's scared, he just like he had seen a dead man who comes back alive.\n\"T-That phrasing… That face… N-No wonder…\"\nWith clacking teeth, Peter voiced his words almost like he wants to scream.\n\"You are Benedict's daughter!\"\nMonica's mind was stopped for a moment.\n\"………….huh?\"\nRight, Benedict was the name of his late father.\nBut why did her father's name come up in the current conversation?\nAlso, how did he know that she was Benedict Rayne's daughter?\nThis situation perhaps could only make Monica confused, but for Peter, it was more than confusion. He was sweating profusely with foams that coming out from the edge of his mouth as he scratched at his face.\n\"So you still want to chase after me even in your death, Benedict! Is this your revenge agains me for selling you to His Excellency!?\"\nThe almost bloodshot eyes were no longer looking at Monica. They were looking at the person that had long gone.\n\"Do you know… my father?\"\nMonica said involuntarily as she walked forward, in response, Peter flailed his hands chaotically and spouted, \"Don't come any closer! Don't come any closer!\"\nContrary to his screaming desperately earlier, he now suddenly showed a maddened distorting smile.\n\"That's right! His Excellency wouldn't let me off the hook anyway… Hahahaha, I'm not gonna be another Arthur! I… I…. hihihi, hahahahahahaha!!\"\nAnd suddenly, Peter's body began to wobble, and fell to his knees. He then shoved his right hand into his pocket, and before Monica noticed, Peter's right hand had turned jet black in color.\nIt was the same curse that he had used on the Green Dragon.\nMonica's spell alone can't stop the erosion of the curse. Furthermore, the speed of erosion in his body was terribly fast. It might be different for Glenn and Monica since they are exceptional. But for one with the lesser mana, the curse would consume him faster.\nIn the span of a couple blinks, all of Peter's body had turned black.\nAnd what the shaman whose body was engulfed in a curse uttered his last moment from his quivered mouth was…\n\"Aah, Benedict… if you still have an obsession to chase me up, then you could try to catch me down all the way to the bottom of the hell.\"\nAfterward, the black shadow crumbled silently before it disappeared like ashes dissolving into the air.\nWith a clank, something fell to the floor. It was a jet-black jewel with a gold-plated ornament. Perhaps it was used as a medium for witchcraft. And Peter used it to cast a curse that claimed his own life.\n\"Why…?\"\nShe can't understand the meaning of the devastating sight before her.\nMore importantly, the words Peter left behind made Monica's mind turn into disarray.\nBehind the death of his father, Benedict Rayne, Peter had played some role in it. He had betrayed and sold his father to someone. And perhaps… that someone was a man that Peter referred to as ‘His Excellency.'\nAnd that man referred to as ‘His Excellency', was probably the mastermind behind the cursed dragon incident.\nMonica was hanging her head down as she covered her face with a shaking hand.\n\"Why does the shaman who put a curse on the dragon know about my father?\"\nThe eyes peering through the gaps between her fingers dulled slowly.\n\"…that person also involved in behind the death of my father?\"\nHer chest felt so painful. Every breath she inhales feels like she is taking in the ashes left behind by that shaman, it almost made her have the urge to vomit.\n\"Why? Why did my father have to die?\"\nNo one answered her muttered voice. After all, the man who knew the truth had been eaten away by the curse before her eyes.\nBut there's one thing that she knows…\n…for whatever reason, someone wants my father to die.\nThe sight flickering in her eyes was the reddened flame that burned away her father.\nAnd the sound echoed in her ears was the voice of the executioner condemning her father.\n──Everyone, this man, Benedict Rayne has secretly studied the most forbidden art and conspired to overthrow the country. Therefore, he is hereby sentenced to be burned.\n──Let the fire of the Spirit God burn away and cleanse the sin that is contained in his body!\nMy father is not a sinner.\nMonica's breath was haggard as she stare closely at the cursed tool.\nPerhaps this item will be the key for her to reach the truth.\nWhat kind of cons[iration had my father involved in? Why did my father have to die?\n\"Dad… just wait for me…\"\nAfter the tool lost its effect, Monica picked it up and clutched it closely in her small palm.\nShe had screamed over and over at the people throwing stones at her father, at the people who burned his books, and at her uncle that cursed him. She had said to them, that my father was not at fault.\nBut the more she shouted, the more malicious glances and violence she got, and the weaker her voice become… it continued until she could only shut her mouth as she hang her head down.\nBut now is different, she was not the same child as before, she had become one of the Seven Sages, the Silent Witch.\n\"I will prove to everyone… that my father was not a sinner.\"",

      "content": "It was exactly ten days after Felix concluded the negotiations with the neighboring Falforia Kingdom and left the Dukes Reinberg mansion.\nAlthough there was a major incident like the appearance of the cursed dragon──or rather, because of this incident, the negotiations could be concluded so smoothly. And Count Marre of the Falforia Kingdom, who had been opposed to the expansion of trade at first, now softened his attitude after experiencing actual cursed dragon damage.\nPerhaps after having overcome the crisis together, he can feel some sense of solidarity among the Falforia's guests and Ridill's people.\nAnd when Felix proposed an information exchange between the two kingdoms to counter the dragon damage in the coming future, Falforia's emissaries took a different attitude since they accept the proposal easily.\nIn common cases, the kingdom would deal with the dragon damage by themselves. So it was rare for a kingdom to cooperate with another to counter the dragon damage since each country had different methods.\nHowever, if Ridill and Falforia form cooperation, they could become the spearhead that leads other countries in countermeasures against the dragon damage, and above all, it would create a strong ally for Ridill.\nIn this diplomacy, not only did Felix increase the wheat import for the kingdom, but he also formed an alliance with Falforia. And through this opportunity alone, he had achieved big merit that would impact his achievements.\nThe nobles of the second prince's faction would be delighted to know that he has defeated the cursed dragon, prevented the foreseen dragon damage, and gained benefits more than they had planned in diplomacy.\nEven so, the cursed dragon incident, that man-made disaster, was brought by Duke Crockford.\nInside the carriage on his way back to the castle, Felix gazed idly out the window and recalled the events that happened at Duke Reinberg's residence.\nEver since he had arrived at Duke Reinberg's household, he had kept his eyes on a certain servant. But the man in his prime age called Peter had disappeared a few days ago.\nHe suspected that the person who orchestrated all of the cursed dragon incidents and wanted to put Felix as a hero was that man.\nPerhaps the real scenario was to make me have defeated the cursed dragon, but the curse went out of control and it almost killed me. And Peter, who didn't want to take the blame and face Duke Crockford's fury, run away.\nBut contrary to expectation, people in Duke Reinberg's household were worried about his disappearance.\nRumors said his close-up encounter with the cursed dragon had frightened him so much that it made him mentally unstable.\nWell. I guess that saves Duke Crockford the trouble and it's more convenient for him to keep his underling quiet.\nEverything has been under the palm of the hand of Duke Crockford.\nAnd the king, the only person who opposes his cause had fallen ill not long ago.\nAnd this will be his best chance to make his move.\nThere was also a letter that he received before leaving Duke Reinberg's mansion.\nWhat was written in the letter was, in summary, that the third prince faction had surrendered to the second prince faction.\nHe suspected that Queen Phyllis, the mother of the third prince, had made some deals with Duke Crockford.\nIn the current situation, the third prince faction only had a small influence over the kingdom and was also the furthest faction that could succeed their prince to the throne. Anxious about his son's future, Queen Phyllis decided to surrender to Duke Crockford at an early stage.\nIn this way, even though the third prince can't succeed to become the king, he would be able to maintain some status in the future.\nAt first, the king was sprawling in his bed because of his illness.\nThen, Felix was regarded as the hero who defeated the cursed dragon.\nAnd lastly, The third prince faction had joined his faction.\nWith all of these foundations laid down, it could be said the preparation for Felix to succeed on the throne was almost complete.\nAll he had to do is predicting the move that Duke Crockford would do after this…\nHe could assassinate the first prince and make it look like an accidental death. But considering his ambition, it would be better to kill him after he made me succeed the throne… the death of the first prince would be the signal for the beginning of the war with the Randall Kingdom.\nEven without killing the first prince, most of the nobles in the kingdom were more inclined toward the second prince faction.\nDespite all the thoughts, all he can do is silently follow his duty as a convenient puppet of Duke Crockford to do his bidding.\nStill, I haven't thought I would receive this many personal benefits in this mission.\nOne of that benefits was his interaction with Glenn Dudley. Things that he grasp from his conversation with him was, that despite his teacher, the Barrier Magician was sided with the first prince faction, the person himself didn't have any particular interest in these political struggles.\nStill, his mana capacity is sure quite extraordinary. And I am certain it had increased more after he overcame that incident.\nIn near future, he will definitely become the candidate of the Seven Sages. If Felix can bring him to his side, he surely could be useful in the future.\nIt would be better if Felix could continue to build a friendly relationship with Glenn. After all, he had a high opinion of Glenn's talent, and he was also rather fond of that open and honest personality.\nThere was also another benefit he gained… he pulled out a sheet of paper from his luggage as a warm smile appeared on his face.\nIt was the essays that had been reviewed by Lady Silent Witch.\nHe had never dreamed that the essays that he had written through his diplomatic and school life would be reviewed directly by a magician that he adores so much.\n…more than anything, I've got one step closer to her.\nSilent Witch was at Serendia Academy.\nEither way, whether she's a student, a teacher, or a school staff, it wouldn't take him long to narrow the possibility of finding her.\nAccording to Lord Abyss Shaman, the remains of the curse on Lady Silent Witch and Glenn Dudley would vanish shortly, but the pain will be lingering for a month or so.\nIn that case, he just has to find a female, who has a small build and has a wound on her left hand.\nSoon… I will meet her in her revealed face.\nUnable to contain his delight, Felix was letting out a small chuckle.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"Welcome back, brother.\"\nThe third prince, Albert, received Felix who was returning to the castle.\nThe impression of the 14 years old Albert was of a clever boy, with unkempt blonde hair and hazel eyes.\nHis attitude might be polite but the eyes he directed toward Felix were sharp as if he couldn't let his guard from him.\n\"I thank you for this welcoming receive. Is there any improvement in His Majesty's health?\"\n\"According to the doctors, his condition is still poor as we speak. Attending a meeting would only put strains on his body.\"\n\"I see…\"\nFelix plastered a sad expression on his face while Albert was looking at him in probing.\nAccording to Duke Crockford's letter, the third prince had given up his right to claim the throne and joined Felix's side.\nAnd from his expression… it seems the queen has not convinced him fully.\nAlthough his mother, Queen Phyllis has given up on the idea of supporting her own son to succeed on the throne, the key player, Albert himself hasn't acknowledged it.\nAnd Felix, just like a gentle brother, narrowed his eyes and said.\n\"That's right. I received a letter from Grandfather. According to it, it seemed you will be transferred to Serendia Academy from your current school Minerva.\"\n\"I've heard it so…\"\nThat words made Albert's face contort as if he was swallowing a bug.\nMany people were attracted to attend Minerva because it was the best institute for training magicians, but there was also another advantage of enrolling there. It was politically neutral.\nAnd why did the third prince who attended Minerva have to transfer to Serendia Academy, a school ruled by Duke Crockford?\nIt was to let everyone know that the third prince had surrendered to Duke Crockford.\nPerhaps, Albert himself was not wished to end up with that result, but his mother had made the decision.\n\"I'm so happy to be able to attend the same school as my dear brother. We have the best facilities, teachers, and courses in Serendia Academy. I wish you could strive hard in your studies to live up to Quenn Phyllis' expectations.\"\nTo live up to Queen Phyllis's expectations—which is to step down from the struggle for the throne and live out the rest of his life in peace.\nAlbert himself should have known that meaning. But looking at his twitching cheeks, it seemed he can't suppress the feeling of humiliation. Even then, Albert tried his best to respond to Felix.\n\"…Yes. I will strive hard so I can be a respectable person like you, brother.\"\nThe ministers behind Albert, who was hoping to talk with Felix seemed to have been refraining themselves. Perhaps he should end his pleasantries with Albert now.\nFelix walked past by and briefly told him, ‘I'm looking forward to your transfer.'\nSince Felix was no longer looking at Albret, the ministers began to greet him to welcome his return and began discussing future arrangements.\nAlbert was giving him a hateful gaze in response, but eventually, he was walking away quietly.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAlbert walked away quietly for a while, but when he reached the corner of the hallway, he started to run.\nHis attendant who had been following behind him all this time briefly admonished his behavior, ‘Lord Albert, you mustn't run in the hallway~,' but his words were unable to reach Albert's ears whose emotions drowned in anger.\nShortly after, he stopped his step when he reached the end of the hallway and shouted.\n\"Patrick! Patrick!\"\nThe attendant called Patrick walked leisurely up to Albert as his short olive brown hair swayed slowly.\nThat behavior made Albert involuntarily stomp angrily.\n\"Patrick! How can you walk so slow?! You can see your master is running! As his attendant, you should have followed your master and run with him too!\"\n\"However, Your Highness, it's a bad manner to run in the hallway~\"\nHe had a point. But it only made Albert angrier and said, ‘don't talk back to your master!' fumingly.\nAlbert's lips pouted like an upset child even when his attendant had arrived.\n\"Did you see how my brother's attitude has become?\"\n\"I would say he behaves like as usual.\"\n\"He was treating me like an unimportant person!\"\n\"In other words, it's as usual.\"\n\"Thanks to my brother, I have to transfer to another school from Minerva! Unlike him, I had a talent for magic! I could even obtain more achievements if I continued my study at Minerva! And yet…\"\nAlbert ruffled his hair irritably, while Patrick was fixing his disheveled blonde hair.\nBut, to such a caring attendant, Albert gave him an order.\n\"Patrick, find out all information about my brother's school life. The subject he is good and bad at, his hobbies, his close friends, his potential fiancee, anything that he can't tell anyone about! Anything! You must find out anything about him! Perhaps, we could find his weakness from there!\"\nIn response to Albert's order, Patrick only gave him a laid-back ‘eeh~?' answer.\n\"I wonder if the perfect Lord Felix has a weakness.\"\n\"That's your job to find out!\"\n\"Haa~ I guess I could only try with my utmost effort~\"\nHis laid-back response only made Albert stomp around even more.\nDamn, this is not funny at all. Both the adults who were bossing him around for their own reasons and his older brother who was looking down on him were really irritating.\nCompared to other children, Albert has achieved many achievements. Despite he was not athletic, often missing the target when swinging a sword, bad at riding horses, and being slow at running, he had worked harder than anyone else in his studies to overcome his shortcomings.\nAnd yet, no one had paid attention to Albert. It was as if there was no difference between having him there or not… in fact, everyone had thought of the third prince that way.\nAs a matter of fact, Albert didn't dislike his older brother, the first prince Lionel that much. On the other hand, he inclined to like him more. He might be a bit hotheaded, but if anything happens, he would take care of Albert, and when he knows Albert was bad at riding horses, he didn't make fun of him, he even let him ride along with him.\nHowever, Albert just can't like his second brother, Felix.\nEveryone says my second brother is the most suitable person to succeed the king, but what's so good about someone whose thoughts are so hard to understand? He didn't even change his expression when he learned Father collapsed.\nFelix might look sad when he told him that His Majesty's health didn't have any improvement, but his eyes didn't give that impression. In fact, he quickly moved on to a meeting with the ministers.\nAs royalty, it might not good to get carried away by emotions, but his reaction was too cold. When Brother Lionel received that news, he was so shaken that he couldn't even finish his dinner.\nHe felt uncanny when looking at his second brother. He couldn't help but had a feeling that he was hiding something behind the cover of his beautiful face.\nIn that case, all I have to do is to uncover the true face that he's hiding… I'll be attending the same school as him after this holiday. This is my chance to find out what his weakness is!",

      "content": "Hilda Everett was contemplating her current life.\nShe had a high position in Magic Institute, had a good salary, and owned a house near the capital, but in her 40 years of living, she was still single.\nSince she can't do any kind of chores she always leaves it to the experienced maids, but because of the approaching winter solstice break and the new year's holiday, the said maid took two weeks off.\nThe attentive and experienced maid was aware that Hilda can't do any housework, so she had prepared two weeks' worth of food for her, but the latter ruined it in a single day.\n\"This is strange. I had followed her instruction to just heat up the soup. But why did it end like this?\"\nOf course, after heating up the soup at the highest heat, the content boiled causing it to overflow, as a result, the bottom part was charred which ended in disaster.\nPanicked at that sight, she tried to put the pot away from the stove in haste, only resulting in her spilling the soup over because didn't know its handle would be very hot too.\nShe was a brilliant researcher who can use all kinds of laboratory equipment like it was her own hands, but that talent can't help her to use the utensils in her house.\nEven so, that kind of disaster alone would not make the maid fall down to her knees, sadly enough, it did not end here.\nAfter spilling the soup over the floor, Hilda tried to clean it, but a strange thought crossed her mind, how about cleaning it with the water magic she's been developing, she thought.\n\"That's a clever idea. As expected of me.\"\nSo, she cast water magic with her feet to sweep the dirtied floor.\nPerhaps letting the water flow in a circular motion would let the stains wash away… but the soup stuck on the floor would not come off easily. And oil stains could not be washed away with water alone.\nThe stubborn stain ticked Hilda so much, so she quicken the motions…\n\"Oh no…\"\nAs the consequence, the momentum of the water, which was on par with attack magic, destroyed one of the legs of the four-legged table. Causing the table to tilt, letting all the precious food on the table slide down onto the overflowing water on the floor.\nThus, that's how we reached where she was contemplating her current life after the great disaster that happened before her.\nShe only repeated ‘what I did is just heating the soup' in a mumble, but for the person would who was aware of the circumstances, they would not be convinced by that excuse.\nWhile her mind preoccupied with the thought of improving the magic, a knock came from the kitchen door.\nDuring winter solstice break, most stores will be closed, and the postman will not be available for deliveries.\nAfter all, during that time people would prefer to stay indoors and spend their quality time with their families. And having a visitor during this time only made Hilda puzzled.\n\"Wait a moment. Who would it be?\"\nWalking over in her soaking boots as the soggy sound echoed, she opened the kitchen door, and then her eyes widened.\n\"I-I'm home.\"\nA petite girl with brown hair uttered those words awkwardly. It was Monica Everett, her adopted daughter.\nLetting out an ‘Oh my!' involuntarily, she hugged the slender girl.\n\"You came, Monica! You should've told me if you're coming home.\"\n\"I-I'm sorry…\"\n\"You see, you don't have to come all the way back here..\"\n\"I've knocked on the front door but got no response, so…\"\nMonica, who's been living in this house until a few years ago, naturally had a spare key to the house. She could have just used the key to enter the house on her own, but it seems that this kind of care and attention of her has not changed a little bit.\n\"We better move to another place than talk in this cold place. How about you come inside… and of course, you must come from the front door.\"\n\"Is that necessary?\"\n\"Of course, since my cute daughter has come home, I want to welcome her from the front door.\"\nAnd with that words, she concealed the great disaster she had left behind in the kitchen.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nSix years ago, after Monica adopted by Hilda, she has been living in this house for less than a year.\nHalf years later, she enrolled in a boarding school Minerva, which after her life went smooth sailing until she was elected and become a Seven Sage.\nFor a single woman like Hilda, occupying a big house like this might be too large for her, but with so many research documents, books, and materials she had accumulated scattered around, it could be said a plus for her. And seems like that habits of hers haven't changed at all.\nThe first time she brought Monica to her home, Hilda said ‘normally it would be more tidy than this' to her in embarassedly. But, as more years passed, the things she added would increase and the house would become more messier than last.\nThanks to the maid's efforts it didn't become so dusty, but with too many documents she had accumulated, it was inevitable that it would still look a bit messy.\nHilda took a jar of cookies from the cupboard and placed it directly on the desk. As a person who hasn't done any hospitality in her life, she had no awareness of how to put the cookies on the plate before serving them. Monica felt strangely nostalgic since she felt Hilda has not changed in that respect.\nHilda who used to be her father's assistant, by nature, was a researcher at heart. She herself must be aware that adopting and raising a child was an unfitting role for her.\nNevertheless, in her own way, Hilda encouraged Monica, patiently reminded her of the words she had almost forgotten and gave her warm food to eat and a comfortable bed to sleep in.\nIt was also her who had encouraged Monica to enroll in Minerva. Monica can't thank her enough for everything that she's done for her.\n\"This brings back memories. The last time you came back was when we celebrated your inauguration of the Seven Sages, wasn't it? Within two years, you've grown up so much…\"\nAlthough Hilda and Monica had exchanged letters frequently, it had been a long time since they had seen each other like this, since they both were very busy with their own work.\nMonica didn't think she had grown that much within two years, but Hilda saw otherwise. Honestly, Monica was happy to hear Hilda say she had grown, it made her mouth feel itchy.\n\"So, how long do you plan to stay here? If I remember, there would be a Seven Sage Summit in the new year ceremony after the winter solstice.\"\n\"Yes… I plan to visit the castle before the new year ceremony began…\"\n\"I guess you would stay here until then. You can relax here. This is your home. after all… ah!\"\nHilda who's been showing a motherly smile suddenly let out a small voice as if she just remembered something. And her gaze was glancing toward the kitchen.\n\"You see, I'm sorry if I can't prepare any food. If you want I can bring some bread and pickles… oh, I still have ginger cake, I remember I stored them in the cupboard!\"\nHilda's words made Monica remember how devastating her adoptive mother was at housework.\n\"Um… I'll go to make some tea.\"\nMonica was going in her stead since she felt concerned if she leave her alone, but Hilda stopped her reflectively as her face turned paler.\n\"Wait! You can't go to the kitchen right now… I mean… let me handle preparing the tea.\"\nUnfortunately, she was too late as the forbidden door leading to the kitchen already opened, and Monica smiled bitterly, looking at the devastation in her sight. It seemed her adoptive mother had not changed at all, she thought.\nAfter all, Hilda has done something similar every year ever since Monica had been adopted into this house.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nIn the end, Monica and Hilda cleaned the kitchen until dark.\nPerhaps this tragedy made Hilda looks very uncomfortable, but from Monica's perspective, it was still better that she only messed up the floor.\nIf it was the worst case, perhaps the small fire she lit up would burn the ceiling already, or perhaps the shelves would already fall all over the place. Her housework skill was so much worse to even be called bad.\nAfter done with the cleaning, Hilda laid out slices of bread and pickled honey-nuts jam alongside ginger cake. Looks like she had taken all the food she stored at home.\n\"Nero, Nero. Wakes up. It's dinner.\"\nMonica called out to Nero, but he didn't respond and kept curled up inside her luggage bag. Perhaps the bitter cold of the past few days has taken a toll on his body, since he spent most of the days staying in hibernation.\nShe was worried about him but no matter what kind of state he was in, he was also a dragon. So this kind of cold should not make him this weak.\nMonica laid Nero near the fireplace and took a seat across from Hilda.\n\"You've come all the way back here and I could only prepare this plain food for you… I'm sorry.\"\n\"I-I think this is more than enough…\"\nIn the first place, she was a person who had never fussed about food. But she was regretting it now since it should be her that had brought some food as souvenirs for her.\nThis trip came in sudden, so the thought of bringing souvenirs has never crossed her mind.\n\"Um… Hilda.\"\n\"What is it?\"\nWhen Monica spoke to her, Hilda had a large mouthful of bread in her mouth. So she waited until she swallowed her bread then spoke her true purpose of coming here.\n\"Do you know Peter Sams?\"\nHilda's face tightens as her eyebrows quiver.\nHer reaction alone had clear enough evidence to prove that she didn't have a good impression of the man called Peter Sams.\nPeter Sams, A servant from Duke Reinberg's family and the real culprit who had cast a curse on the Green Dragon and turned it into a cursed dragon.\nAnd he was also the man who knew something behind his father's death.\nThe moment Peter looked at Monica's face was also the moment he realized that she was the daughter of Benedict Rayne. Which meant, he had met her before in the past.\nBut Monica didn't recognize Peter at all.\nIn fact, only a few people know that Monica Everett was Benedict Rayne's daughter. What everyone knew was that Monica Everett was a vagrant child who had been adopted by Hilda Everett from the street.\nSo the people who know Monica's father was Benedict Rayne were Hilda and people who knows Monica from her childhood.\nSince Monica spent most of her day in her father's laboratory, it was quite possible someone from her father's circle would remember her face. Moreover, considering how her growth was stunted and her face still likes a child's, it made her impression almost the same as in her childhood. So it would not that surprising if someone with a good memory would remember her.\nHilda was her father's assistant and also the person who came in and out of his lab the most.\nThat's why Monica suspected that Hilda might know something about Peter and her guess was right.\n\"…Monica, what brought that man's name to this conversation all of a sudden?\"\nHilda wiped crumbs from her mouth and stared at Monica patiently.\nMonica straightened her posture and answered.\n\"I can't tell you all the details, but long story short, I come across Peter. He mentioned my father's name when he saw my face… moreover, he brought up a remark that he was involved in my father's death…\"\nA streak of blue veins surfaced on the back of Hilda's hand, which was cupping on the table. Perhaps because of her anger, her hands were quivering.\nHilda dropped her gaze and grunted in an angry voice.\n\"How could I forget that bastard… There were many times when I really wanted to tear him to pieces with my own hands.\"\nHilda, who had just uttered the most unsettling statement, was breathing heavily, but she then take a deep breath to calm herself and spoke words to Monica in her usual rational tone.\n\"…Monica, you better not involve yourself with Peter Sams… There's a lot of power working behind that man. Even if it's you, you can be in danger if you try to provoke him.\"\nAs one of the Seven Sages, Monica had the status of Count Magician which was equal to the rank of a count.\nEven with that title, she still would be in danger if her opponents were royalty or people with equal ranks.\nMonica tilted her head and looked back at her adopted mother.\n\"Was Peter the reason my father was executed?\"\nA grinding sound came from Hilda's mouth after she gritted her teeth so hard.\nThe face of her adoptive mother, who always smiles gently, now had an enraged expression as if the emotions she bottled up has surfaced.\n\"Peter Sams could be said your father, Doctor Rayne's rival. Nonetheless, he would frequently visit his laboratory and bring up collaborative research.\"\n\"Peter was a researcher, too?\"\n\"Yes. I was conducting an experiment on how to control a living creature with magic, a subject that could be said almost to belong to the forbidden area, while Dr. Rayne was studying the relationship between the human body and magic, so our research themes were relatively close to each other.\"\nEventually, he dropped bringing up the collaborative research, but an incident occurred.\nThere was a person who reported to the official that Benedict Rayne was studying the most forbidden magic, ‘Ressurection.'\nResurrecting a dead person was the most taboo magic in the kingdom, followed by black flame and weather manipulation. Let alone experimenting with its usability, even if it was merely for research material, they would be punished death sentence.\n\"As a matter of fact, Dr. Rayne did not conduct any research about resurrection. He was a person who respect life more than anything. So he would never commit such a blasphemy act of resurrecting a dead person.\"\nBut, the officer who was investigating Dr. Rayne's laboratory found several documents and forbidden books of resurrection inside.\nTo top it off, Peter testified to the officer that Dr. Rayne was researching resurrection magic.\nAfterward, he was regarded as guilty and sentenced to death.\n\"We tried to argue back. We told them all of this was Peter Sams' fabrication. All the materials and the books they confiscated were things that he has been planted in Dr. Rayne's laboratory all along. But the attitude of the officials remained the same. Things were working in his favor to an unnatural degree.\"\nFeeling something off, Hilda decided to do a solo investigation of the abnormality of Peter's circumstances… until she found out about the esteemed noble behind his back.\nUnfortunately, by the time Hilda arrived at the truth, Dr. Rayne's execution had already been carried out.\nWhat had made that unnatural execution carried out abruptly without trial was because of the pressure of that personage.\nMonica clenched her fists in her lap. Although her blood drained from her face, strangely enough, she couldn't stop the unpleasant feeling. Her palm was slightly wet from her sweat.\n\"…can you tell me the name of that noble?\"\nHilda shook her head at Monica's inquiry.\n\"Right now you are the Seven Sage. You might have to involve yourself with that person in the far future… so I can't tell his name.\"\nAfter all, Hilda knows Monica very well.\nIf Monica were to come in contact with that person in the palace… she would lose her composure for sure.\nAnd if by any chance the truth of Monica was the daughter of the sinner Benedict Rayne was revealed, she would be in a dangerous position.\nThat's why Hilda was keeping her mouth shut to protect Monica.\nAnd because Monica was aware of that, she can't push Hilda any further.",

      "content": "Hilda had used almost half of Monica's room in Everett House as storage, but since the maid had cleaned it periodically, the bed and the desk still looked tidy.\nNero has not woken up ever since Monica arrived at the Everett house, not even once. So she brought him onto hug and went to her room, where she laid him on her bed afterward. She felt Nero won't wake up until spring if his conditions continued like this.\nIt was honestly surprising for her to have no one to talk to could be this lonely.\nShe never had this kind of loneliness when living in the cabin alone… but before she knew it, she had become completely accustomed to living together with Nero.\n\"Will he wake up if he's getting warm enough?\"\nMonica pulled the blanket over Nero and stroked him from the top of it, but her attempt didn't seem to work.\nShe kept stroking Nero for a while, afterwards, she quietly stood up, took out a piece of paper and a pen, and sat down at the writing desk.\nShe wanted to organize all the recent events and questions on paper before going to bed.\nI should write what actually happened first…\n＊ ＊ ＊\nEvents Had Happened\nSeven Years Ago: My father was charged guilty of ‘researching the most taboo spell' and sentenced to death. One Week Ago: A cursed dragon appeared in Duke Reinberg's territory. The cause of the appearance was witchcraft cast by a shaman. And that shaman was Peter Sams, a servant from Duke Reinberg Mansion. ＊ ＊ ＊\nPeter Sams was involved in both cases of her father's execution and the cursed dragon. Following that, Monica wrote all the questions that came to her mind.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nQuestionable Aspects\nBy planting a cursed magical tool, Peter managed to create a cursed dragon → Why did he need to create a cursed dragon? He also mentioned that he sold her father to ‘His Excellency' → Does ‘His Excellency' refer to Duke Reinberg? Also, for what purpose did he sell his father out to him? An influential aristocrat was backing him from the shadow→ Is that person ‘His Excellency' as well? And why did ‘His Excellency' lend his hand to him? In his confused state, Peter mentioned ‘I'm not going to be a second Arthur' → Who is Arthur? His Highness already knew that the cause of the appearance of the cursed dragon was witchcraft → Then, why did he keep quiet? Did His Highness know Peter was the culprit? ＊ ＊ ＊\nAfter writing all of these events, she exhaled a long breath.\nThe thing that still concerns her the most is the presence of an influential aristocrat behind Peter. Perhaps the person who lent his hand to him and the person he referred to as \"His Excellency\" was the same individual.\nWhen Peter mentioned ‘His Excellency', one would generally think of Duke Reinberg, if one considers his status as a servant of Duke Reinberg Household.\nHowever, if one defines Duke Reinberg in a simple term, he was ‘a low-key figure.' He hardly spoke when the negotiation with Falforia took place and was likely a moderate supporter of Prince Felix.\nWell, they say looks can be deceiving…\nShe felt something off when comparing His Excellency's persona to Duke Reinberg. With the only clue—the magic tool Peter used in his last moment—left behind, she tried to investigate it from another perspective.\nMonica told Ray Albright the Abyss Shaman about Peter's last moment, leaving the part her father's name was mentioned.\nBefore handing out the magic tool, she told him that Peter Sams was the culprit behind the Green Dragon incident and he killed himself using this magic tool when questioned.\nBy now, Ray should have done his investigation about them.\nIf Peter was proved to be a shaman… It's highly likely he had some connection with the shaman family of Albright. Hopefully, we can find out something from it…\nAbyss Shaman told her they should meet again at the New Year Ceremony, and he will bring her some information about his investigation later.\nMonica sighed as she crumpled up the note she wrote. Afterward, she cast a chantless spell to burn it into ashes before she threw it into a trash bin.\nI'm aware that Hilda is concerned about me…\nHowever, Monica wanted to know the truth even if she has to stake her position as one of the Seven Sages.\nMonica laid down Nero to let him sleep on her side and took a book from the bag under her pillow. She got this book, which her father wrote, from Porter's store.\nThe human body is made up of a vast collection of numbers—it was the sentence at the beginning of the book which she had read many times over.\nAt first, Monica had a hard time understanding the content with how low her proficiency in biology and medicine was, but after reading the book bit by bit while looking for a reference to comprehend the technical terms, then she could understand how valuable this book is.\nHer father was researching the inherited genetics that came from both parents, especially the inherited mana. He mentioned in his book, by analyzing their mana alone he could identify a person and his/her blood relatives.\nPerhaps, If her father was still alive, the research of medical science in the Ridill Kingdom would have been more developed. Especially the research on genetic diseases, it probably would have advanced by leaps and bounds by now.\nMonica was flipping through the page which probably had been read for hundred times when she suddenly remembered Porter's words.\nWait, I remember he mentioned that he was a friend of my father…\nHe was the owner of an antiquarian bookstore, a novelist under the name Dustin Gunther and also the man who sold Monica's father's book two gold coins.\nGiven how he gave his father's book a price worth two gold coins, Monica believed he either recognized the discoveries of her father's research or was very close to her father.\nI wonder if Porter has visited my father's lab before…\nFrankly, Monica didn't remember much about the people who frequented her father's lab during her childhood. Since she was mostly so absorbed in reading books, the only person she could remember clearly was Hilda, who always gave her sweets.\nEver since a child, Monica could hardly remember a person's face. Her habit to remember people's faces and bodies by their numbers was the result of her trying to escape into the world of numbers after she was frequently abused by her uncle. For that reason, Monica didn't recognize Peter whom she had probably met in her childhood.\nWhile Monica was recalling her childhood memory as she flipped the pages, she just realized that the flyleaf which she thought had not existed turned out to be stuck together with the previous page.\n\"…?\"\nShe pried open the page gently and found a piece of paper in between. It looked like a piece of manuscript paper. Perhaps someone had pasted some glue to make these pages stick together. After all, this was the only last page that she has been not opened.\nShe peeled the page as she was making sure to not tear the paper. In there, she found handwriting.\nIf you've discovered the truth about the Black Chalice, you can come back and find me in the store.\nShe held up a piece of paper as she inspected it with a lamp.\nIt used cheap paper and ink, but its color hasn't faded out. Probably it was written a few months ago.\nThe handwriting was a mess, almost as if it had been scratched. Perhaps this piece of the manuscript was written in haste before he/she applied a thin layer of glue to the last pages and inserted it in between.\nIf she remembered correctly, Porter was writing his novel at that time. She also recalled some manuscripts and stationery scattered about on his desk. In some cases, a bookstore owner would keep some glue for use.\nDid Porter do this?\nThe store mentioned in the manuscript should be referring to Porter's Antiquarian Bookstore.\nBut what about the Black Chalice?\nShe tried to recall her own memory, but she didn't remember having heard about it. The book her father wrote also never mentioned anything about the ‘Black Chalice'.\nIs this some kind of a term? Or perhaps some secret code?\nMonica pondered heavily over the word of the Black Chalice as she laid down on her bed.\nBut, the sleepiness has taken over her before she can come up with anything.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThat night Monica had a dream about his father.\nIn her dream, she saw the scene where she herself so focused on reading a math book, and her father was sitting on the chair, looking at her while sipping a cup of coffee.\nSitting beside him was a guest whose face and clothes were blurred. From his posture, she could deduce that person was a man.\nThe blurred man took a sip of his coffee and let out a single breath.\n\"Haa… its bitter taste is quite strong yet not displeasing. I would say it is quite good. More than anything, it could wake up one from sleepiness. A perfect accompaniment for writing manuscript.\"\n\"Hilda had tried to take a sip but she said its bitterness was too strong. Perhaps you are the only person who took a liking to my coffee.\"\n\"I always keep my adventurous spirit in everything I do. If one lost their adventurous spirit in their heart, they only live a regressing life, Benedict.\"\nAfter uttering such a familiar phrase, the guest sipped his coffee and glanced at Monica, who was absorbed in her math book.\n\"Still, your daughter is a peculiar one. I've been wondering what she read, it turns out she read a math book. Can she understand such a difficult book?\"\n\"Of course, she can. She is my genius daughter after all.\"\n\"I guess my novel is not interesting enough for her.\"\n\"I feel bad for you. But, don't worry. I will read your novel in her stead.\"\n\"I brought this novel for your daughter. I thought a scholar like you would not be interested in an adventure novel like this.\"\n\"I think your novel is quite interesting. Maybe the country in your novel was only fictional, but you managed to incorporate the cultures and customs of another country into it. I also find the appearance of the important item in your previous novel very interesting, since they are quite similar to my research. Is that another reference from another country?\"\n\"Well…\"\nMonica was still focusing on her math book silently while her father and his guest sat beside her as they continued with their talk.\nIt was only a dream, a guileless dream that she had that night.\nYes, it was only a dream…",

      "content": "Special thanks to Phal for my first donation. Thank you very much for your support!!\nIn the southwestern part of the Ridill Kingdom, a town where Cyril was born, Ashendarte. It was a town with its specialty was weaving since all the women in the town have been taught weaving since they can remember. It was no different with Cyril's mother, as she always sat in front of the loom weaving beautifully patterned cloth using colorful threads.\nAlthough hand weaving had been declining recently with the advent of automatic looms that are powered by water, the ‘Ashend Weaving' of Ascendarte was still very popular among local aristocrats because of its exquisite patterns and vivid colors.\nHe had not visited his hometown in a long time and the townscape had changed in many ways from Cyril's memory, but hearing the clattering sound of weaving was still the same made him feel awfully nostalgic.\nGetting off of the coach, Cyril walked down the nostalgic streets with a travel bag in his hand.\nMarquis Highon had offered him to use their carriage for his return to his home, but Cyril politely decline as people can recognize the noble's carriage instantly and it would only make him stand out if it was parked near his parent's house.\nHis mother does not like to draw attention. Therefore, he didn't wear the clothes Marquis Highon had given him, but he wore plain clothes for traveling.\nHis appearance–the lustrous platinum blonde hair, deep blue eyes, and gorgeous face–always gave people the impression of a noble, as a result, Cyrils always stand out among the children around him.\nCyril still remembered how it made her mother concerned more than himself.\nThe look she gave him when looking at his face always looked so frightened, since it always reminded her of her husband. After all, she was afraid that one day Cyril would become good for nothing like his father.\nCyril lowered his hat down as he walked with his gaze down.\nHe might have used to the neighbors' fear and peculiar gaze directed at him. But that doesn't mean he wants those stares directed at his mother.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThe house where Cyril grew up remained the same after all these years. Despite all the financial support Cyril's mother received from the Marquis Highon, which should be enough for her to live without working, she still maintains the same lifestyle as she did in the past.\nCyril gulped as he was standing in front of the door. The right hand which was raised to knock on the door stopped abruptly.\nWhat if he opened this door and says, \"I'm home\"…but his mother replies, \"This is not your house anymore, is it?\" Such a thought passed through his mind.\n\"………\"\nAfter standing in distress, Cyril eventually settled down to one conclusion.\nYeah, he can just say, ‘It's been a while.' That way, the conversation would flow more naturally. Then, he would first ask how she has been…\n\"Oh, welcome home.\"\nCyril almost inadvertently dropped his luggage when he heard a voice behind him.\nTurning around awkwardly, he saw his mother standing behind him with a broom in her hand. Apparently, she was cleaning up around the house.\n\"I-I-I'm ho-home!\"\nWith this, he couldn't laugh at Monica Norton anymore. That was how clumsily his reply sounded.\nHis mother looked at Cyril somewhat absentmindedly, but she propped the broomstick up against the wall and opened the door to the house.\n\"It must have been cold. I'll fire up the fireplace now.\"\n\"L-Let me do it.\"\n\"Is that so? Then, can I ask you to fire up the fireplace?\"\nHis mother was welcoming his arrival. His mother asked him for help as if it was a natural thing to do. Just knowing that fact had made things that burdened his mind relieved and it also made him want to cry.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nIt had been a long time since he visited his parent's house, which had not changed from Cyril's memory as much as its outward appearance.\nIn the corner of the room lay a loom, the tool she always uses for work, on which multicolored threads drew beautiful and exquisite patterns.\nWhite roses were woven with glossy threads into an ultramarine fabric. The roses themselves were all white, but upon closer inspection, several types of threads with slightly different luster and color were actually woven into the fabric, giving it a three-dimensional impression.\nAs soon as the fireplace was lit, his mother boiled water to make tea.\n\"Here's your tea\"\n\"Thank you.\"\nFor a person who can't handle a hot drink, the tea at a moderate temperature was sweetened on his tongue. He had loved this taste since he was a child.\nTaking another sip, he can feel his chest tightening with nostalgia.\nHis mother, seated across from him, was drinking her tea in silence, but when the cup was about half empty, she said in a slightly stiff tone.\n\"How was your school life?\"\nCyril straightened his back in nervousness.\nHe had been thinking about what he was going to talk to his mother about all the way in the carriage on the way home, but when he finally actually faced her, his mind went blank and the words could not come out properly.\nIn the first place, everything related to school life has always been written in letters, so he can't think of any new topic to talk about.\nCyril put the cup back on the table and mulled it over.\nThat's right. In times like these, I could talk about His Highness.\nCyril had the confidence to carry on talking about Felix until the end of the day.\nWhenever Cyril speaks passionately about Felix, Elliot always looks at him as if he is looking at something extremely regrettable, but in Cyril's perspective, he has always thought that Elliot doesn't have enough respect for his highness.\n\"Things are going well at the Student Council. Though things have been a bit hectic this year due to the change of treasurer, His Highness' excellent leadership has enabled us to finish all the events without a hitch, and I am once again impressed by His Highness' excellent command of the situation. In particular, His Highness' speech at the school festival…\"\n\"I wish to hear about you more than about His Highness…\"\nHer words made him stop his speech.\nAfter a few awkward glances, Cyril finally opened his mouth.\n\"…well, I've written you all my stories in the letters, so I don't think…\"\n\"I want to hear it directly from you.\"\nAt his mother's words, Cyril fell silent with a tense face.\nIn his childhood when he still attended school in the city, he used to proudly tell his mother about how he was praised by his teachers after getting good test scores, but now he feels afraid to talk about himself.\n–Mother, I got a hundred points on the exam today. I actually got first!\nEvery time he made a report with such enthusiasm, his mother would mutter ‘is that so?' with a sigh, and look away.\nIf it were a letter, he could simply write and reflect on it calmly. But he feared how his mother would react, and that's why he was afraid to speak directly to his mother, in this case, Cyril stopped his words.\nBut he can't keep quiet forever.\nMoreover, he had things to tell his mother.\n\"This year, I have been invited to be taken along in the New Year's Ceremony.\"\nNew Year's Ceremonies, which take place on the day after the winter solstice, are ceremonies where nobles from all over the country take turns to visit the castle and greet the king.\nEssentially, only those who hold peerage participate in this New Year's ceremony, and it is customary for their families to stay at home.\nBut Marquis Highon declared that he would take Cyril with him to this year's New Year's Ceremony.\nIn other words, Marquis Highon has accepted Cyril, his adopted son, as his successor.\nIt has been several years since he was adopted by the Marquis family, yet Cyril still felt uneasy all the time. Clearly, everyone could see that he was inferior to Claudia in terms of brainpower.\nEven when he tried to learn magic to acquire his own unique skills, he ended up developing a mana overdose.\nHe could not live up to their expectation and finds himself lacking in everything. At this rate, the Marquis might abandon him altogether… such fears always drive Cyril to the edge.\nFortunately, for the past few months or so, he has been so busy that he hasn't had time to feel such anxieties. Mainly because of a junior of his who he can't take his eyes off.\nWhen the Marquis of Highon brought up the subject of the New Year's ceremony, Cyril was so moved with emotion that he nearly broke down in tears. That was how happy he was.\nAt the same time, however, a sense of uneasiness welled up in his heart.\nWhat kind of face would his mother make when she hears this news?\nHowever many times he imagines it, he could only think of his mother in his memory saying, ‘\nI knew it. You are indeed a nobleman's son.'\nwith a sigh.\nCyril's fingertips trembled with fear for what would happen if he were to be told the same thing again.\nHe was afraid to look at his mother's face. He didn't know what to do if she sighs with a resigned look on her face.\nWhen Cyril turned his head down, his mother told him softly.\n\"…You have worked hard.\"\nCyril's slender shoulders shuddered and his downcast face slowly lifted.\nHis mother, sitting across from him, looked serene.\n\"When I visited the school festival, I met a girl who showed me around. She told me that you are a kind person… she told me you always steadily teach her how to do the job properly.\"\n\"………\"\n\"Marquis Highon must have seen that in you.\"\nReflected at the edge of his blurred vision was his mother's loom.\nAs a child, Cyril always loved watching his mother weaving from this seat as beautiful patterns gradually formed along with the clattering sound of the weaving.\n\"Weave it steadily, one by one. You have to be steady and careful when weaving.\"\nTherefore, Cyril has been working hard, steadily and carefully, one thing at a time.\nCyril reflected on his mother's words, \"You have worked hard,\" which he received for the first time.\nAnd so he replied, with a face like a tearful smile, but still proud.\n\"I am your son, after all.\"",

      "content": "Special thanks to Thy and Gaeblin for the donation! Thank you!! m(_ _)m\nThe New Year Ceremony in the Ridill Kingdom is always held on the day after the winter solstice which will be celebrated in the castle for a whole week.\nThe ceremony begins with the royal family inviting nobles to the castle which will be followed by the banquet over the next week. During this time, the nobles across the country would come to visit the banquet and greet the king in turn… and that is how the ceremony goes every year.\nHowever, since the king has been on a sickbed for the recent year, both the ceremony and the banquet will be held on a reduced scale.\nGiven the king was unable to appear on the throne, each prince was assigned to a different role: the first prince was in charge of the New Year's Ceremony and the second prince was in charge of the banquet, but the nobles of their respective factions were still glowering at each other on the decision. As a result, the atmosphere in the royal palace felt more tense than usual.\nAs the Seven Sages, Monica had an obligation to participate in everything from the ceremony on the first day of the New Year to the banquet that followed for the rest of the week.\nLast year, she had inadvertently become so engrossed in developing a magic formula and nearly missed the ceremony, but this year she had arrived at the castle with plenty of time to spare.\nOn the night of the winter solstice when the longest night occurs, the Spirit King of Darkness Eldiora goes to its slumber, while at the sunrise after the winter solstice was when the Spirit King of Light Serendine awakens.\nMonica woke up at sunrise in one of the castle's guest rooms on the morning of the first day of the New Year—which also is known as Serendine's Awakening—to prepare herself in her long spare time.\nThe guest room the royal had provided for the Seven Sages was so luxurious even she who has stayed in this room on many occasions still felt nervous when occupying it. Perhaps, except for the bedside where she used to place her luggage, the only furniture she mostly used in the room was the bed.\nShe took out her formal robe from the luggage on the bedside.\nThe robe of the Seven Sages itself had two types, one for daily use and the other for formal wear. While both were navy blue in color and embroidered with gold and silver threads, the formal one had more ornaments and more elaborate embroideries.\nMonica, who does not often appear in public, only wore this robe once a year at the New Year's ceremony.\nAfter struggling with the unaccustomed ornaments and managing to get dressed, Monica turned her attention to Nero, who was still curled up on the bed.\nEven now, Nero remained curled up and sleeping peacefully. Just like during their stay at Hilda's house, he showed no sign of waking up.\nMonica put the blanket back on Nero, pulled the hood back over her eyes, grabbed her scepter firmly, and left the room.\nMonica's main concern during her stay at the castle was whether she would run into Felix.\nHowever, Felix seems to be busy preparing for the New Year's Ceremony banquet, and so far she hardly saw him at all.\nStill, it was best not to let one's guard down, so Monica moved cautiously, taking care not to let her hood come off as she moved.\nThe place where Monica headed was a room called ‘Jade Room' located at the western end of the castle of the Ridill Kingdom.\nThe room was protected by multiple barriers, and only the Seven Sages and the king were permitted to enter.\nNormally, this room was only used for meetings of the Seven Sages, but during the New Year Ceremony, the royal had made them stay in this Jade Room until the ceremony begins.\nI wonder if the other Seven Sages have already arrived…\nAfter verifying that she was one of the Seven Sages by touching the crest above the door with the tip of her scepter, the door was automatically unlocked.\nFeeling slightly nervous, Monica opened the door…\n\"Kaboom!\"\nA fireball suddenly appeared before her eyes, so she reflexively used her chantless spell to set up a defensive barrier.\n\"Ah… Um… Eh?\"\nWhile Monica was sprawled on the floor, unable to speak, a huge, dark-haired man with a full-face beard walked up to her.\n\"Oh, sorry about that, Miss Silent. Some stray bullet went your way.\"\nThe man who was laughing ‘Gahaha!' was Bradford Firestone the Artillery Magician.\nAmong the Seven Sages, he possesses the highest firepower in offensive magic.\n\"Boys, please~ Could you do that kind of thing outside~ Look, you're scaring Monica~\"\nMary Harvey, the Star Oracle Witch, complained with pouting lips, and Bradford scratched his head and made an excuse.\n\"Oh, sorry 'bout that. To start my New Year, I'm planning to fight a strong enemy and gave Barrier Guy a challenge but he dodged my attack without even putting up his barrier.\"\n\"Why should I waste my mana in the New Year?\"\nLouis Miller the Barrier Magician said languidly as he sat while grooming his hair.\nThis exchange gave Monica a general idea of what was going on.\nA hot-blooded Bradford challenged Louis whose in the mood of the New Year to a fight, then fired an offensive spell at him despite still inside the room. Louis evaded it, but the stray bullet lead to Monica, who just opened the door.\nSince Jade Room was protected by strong defensive barriers, even if he used such an offensive spell, it would not leave any damage to the walls and doors.\nEven so, the only person who was crazy enough to unleash an offensive spell inside the room was perhaps only Bradford alone.\nAs Monica slumped in a daze, a high-pitched voice interrupted her.\n\"Oh, for crying out loud, what were you thinking unleashing offensive magic inside the room, Sir Artillery Magician? Fortunately, the one who opened the door was a person who mastered the chantless spell, Miss Silent Witch here, but have you considered what would happen if it had been His Majesty?!\"\nThe aquiline-nosed man in his fifties who spoke in a somewhat exaggerated manner was Emanuel Darwin the Jewel Magician.\nHis entire body was adorned with precious stones as if to symbolize his epithet, but Bradford only brushed it off with a laugh.\n\"You don't have to be so upset, Mr. Jewel. If the person who opened the door was really His Majesty, I'm sure the barrier would have done something to block it.\"\n\"It might be strong, but don't put your trust too much in it.\"\nIn response to Bradford's words, Louis muttered without turning his attention, and now he began to polish his nails.\nSeeing Louis seemed didn't care afterward, Monica was certain the words he said didn't come from his heart. When Louis evaded Bradford's attack, he must be aware Monica was behind the door, and knowing Monica would be able to do something about it with her chantless spell, he let the attack pass by.\nH-He's so horribleeee…\nMonica really wanted to cry as she tried to stand up staggeringly, while Emanuel turned his attention to Monica, rattling the ornaments all over his body.\n\"Are you alright, Miss Silent Witch?\"\n\"I-I-I'm fine…\"\nEmanuel pulled Monica's hand to help her stand up before turning his gaze to Bradford and Louis simultaneously in resentment.\n\"You really have some nerve to engage in a private fight in this sacred Jade Room, Sir Artillery Magician, Sir Barrier Magician!\"\nStill, his words seemed far-fetched. Apparently, he wanted to use Bradford's bad habits as an excuse to criticize Louis as well. Emanuel seemed to have some kind of grudge to pick against Louis.\nLouise blew his polished nails, without paying any attention to Emanuel.\n\"If you want to lecture, do it with that shameless old man alone. Don't involve me in this matter, I'm the victim here.\"\n\"Well, I think most of the people here have more nerve than you. You'll go bald if you get so hung up on the trifle matters, Mr. Jewel.\"\nHearing Bradford's words, Emanuel's cheeks twitched while Louis showed his refreshing grin.\n\"Hahaha! Sir Artillery Magician sure has a youth spirit, I always envy you to be able to do anything without burden.\"\n\"Of course. In my book, I do what I want.\"\n\"…that's what he says, Sir Jewel Magician.\"\nHearing Louis said this with a smirk, Emanuel, whose hairline had recently thinned out, had a blue streak at his temple.\nMonica was familiar with this scene.\nThis scene was similar to two elementary school brats fighting in front of the nagging teacher. It was a sight far different from what should have been a gathering of the Seven Sages.\nAs Monica felt anxious, wondering if Emanuel was going to explode, Emanuel coughed and looked at Monica.\n\"Now I'm certain, most people here are really barbaric, don't you think so too, Miss Silent Witch?\"\n\"Eh? Ah… Well…\"\n\"Oh, I just remembered, I heard you and His Highness Felix had slayed a cursed dragon the other day. What you two did was really a heroic deed! I also heard you have risked your life to protect His Highness. I feel really proud to have you as a member of the Seven Sages!\"\n\"Um… Er…\"\n\"Not long ago you defeated the Black Dragon Wogan, now you slayed a cursed dragon in Reinberg! It would not exaggerate if people would call you a hero who has defeated the two greatest evil dragons and etched in history! I'm sure His Highness Felix would be pleased to be able to fight side by side with you!\"\nMonica could feel his true intentions to rope her into his faction behind the blatant praise that was directed at her.\nEmanuel Darwin the Jewel Magician was a member of the second prince's faction and had a close relationship with Duke Crockford. As the man who chose Felix as the next king, he probably planned to bring Monica, who fought together with Felix against the Cursed Dragon, to their faction.\nIf one divides the Seven Sages into factions, Louis will be in the first prince's faction, Emanuel in the second prince's faction, while the rest of them were neutral.\nThat's why, even if he was only able to rope one neutral member of the Seven Sages into the second prince's faction, the power balance would change drastically.\nWhile Monica was struggling to give him a reply, Mary who noticed this gave Monica a helping hand.\n\"Heeeey~ Monica~ Have you seen Raul on the way here?\"\n\"N-No… I haven't seen Lord Thorn Witch at all…\"\n\"Oh my, what a pitiful boy~ Oh right, Monica. Can I ask you to get Raul here? Knowing him, perhaps he is still strolling in the garden.\"\nShe nodded to Mary's request without a second thought since she can't bear this awkward atmosphere anymore.\nMary smiled knowingly and shook the shoulder of Ray Albright the Abyss Shaman, who until now had been lying prone on the desk.\n\"Hey, Ray, go accompany her. Take a little walk and soak up some sunlight to wake up yourself from the sleepiness.\"\nAfter being forced to wake up, Ray raised his face slowly as he stared into the air with empty eyes and an eerie smile on his face.\n\"A walk… a walk together… a walk together alone with a girl… can it be called a walk date? Hmm, I like how it sounds, a walk date. A wholesome walk date. It sounds like I, a shaman, am being loved wholesomely. Oh, it sounds great!\"\nSeems like the urge of the Abyss Shaman wanting to be loved was at its peak yet again.\nAlthough seeing the way his laugh was not without discomfort, she found it convenient to be able to talk to Ray alone. It was a chance to ask him about Peter Sams and his magic tool.\nSo Monica asked Ray in a bow.\n\"U-Um… Lord Abyss Shaman, may I ask you to accompany me in bringing Lord Raul here…?\"\nRay stared at Monica with glistening pink eyes and closed the distance with one step and then another. She felt the way he closed the distance was scary.\n\"…do you love me?\"\n\"I-I admire you.\"\n\"Do you adore me?\"\n\"I adore you.\"\n\"Then, do you genuinely love me?\"\n\"I-I… I… I genuinely… genuinely… What is genuine love?!\"\nMonica cried out in tears while the rest of the Seven Sages looked at her with sympathy.\nAt this moment, the Seven Sages who were seldom working together have reached the same thought. They were giving Monica sympathy.",

      "content": "After stepping out from his carriage, Cyril Ashley was greeted by the sight of the magnificent towering structure of the royal palace of the Ridill Kingdom. With mixed feelings of nervousness and excitement, he walked along the cobblestones, heading toward it.\nWalking ahead of him was his adoptive father, Marquis Highon, who was stroking his mustache as he glanced at Cyril.\n\"Are you nervous?\"\n\"…no, I'm fine.\"\n\"Your right hand and right foot moved forward at the same time, though.\"\nWhen Marquis Highon pointed that to Cyril, he suddenly stopped his walk.\nCyril would be officially introduced as the successor of Marquis Highon at this New Year Ceremony. Any mishaps were unforgivable—or so expressed Cyril with his stiff expression and body due to his nervousness.\nEver since he was adopted by the Marquis, he has been invited to social events on many occasions, except to the royal palace.\nHe has seen many extravagant mansions, but he still felt overwhelmed by the austere castle in front of him which was extravagant yet steeped in history.\n‘Hm,' commented Marquis Highon with a pensive look. Cyril was worried, wondering if Marquis was feeling exasperated or disappointed because of his conduct… and so Marquis Highon proposed a suggestion to him.\n\"Have you visited the palace garden before?\"\n\"Eh, ah, no…\"\n\"It is a wonderful garden. You should go take a look at it. I'll be waiting for you here.\"\nMarquis wanted him to take a stroll in the garden to relieve some tensions.\nHe might be feeling bad for making him worry about him, but he still took at his word.\n\"…I'm sorry for making you worry, father.\"\n\"You are still young. I think a boy around your age should be expressing some excitement when visiting the royal palace.\"\nWith a calm and gentle voice, he added, ‘go ahead.'\nIn response, Cyril bowed to his adoptive father and walked heading to the garden.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nCyril let out an exclamation as he stepped into the castle garden.\nDespite in winter season when its temperature was cold enough for snow to fall at any moment, the garden was still filled with flowers in full blooms.\nEspecially the winter roses, the word ‘fascinating' was not enough to describe their beauty.\nThere were only a few kinds of roses that could bloom in winter, not to mention it would only bloom with one or two flowers, but in this garden, as if ignoring the changing seasons, they all were blooming like in the peak summer season.\nEvery rose came with big petals and was brighter in color. Cyril has never seen roses bloom so vividly in winter.\nAs he walked down in amazement, he noticed a tree with dark green leaves blooming with bright flowers.\nThe tree itself didn't seem very tall, but the contrast between the reddish-pink petals, yellow stamens, and its deep green leaves made it stand out against the pale sky blue of winter.\nWhile he was admiring these flowers he had never seen, a voice came out suddenly.\n\"Aren't they beautiful? They are the new flowers brought from a foreign country. It's called camelia.\"\nHe seemed to hear a voice from above. Above? He tilted his head up and saw a man sitting on top of a tall tree with a cat in his arms.\nIf this man were a suspicious person or a trespasser, he would not bother to call him out. He was probably the gardener of this garden.\nAs Cyril was pondering about this, the man, stroking the cat, greeted, ‘Heya~' in a friendly manner.\n\"I climbed a tree to save this cat, but now I can't get down. Can you help me?\"\nWhat kind of gardener can't get down from a tree?\nWhile that thought crossed his mind, Cyril still chanted a short spell. It was a shortened incantation he just learned recently to make an icy slope from the tree where the man was to the ground. The man exclaimed in admiration as he slid down the icy slope smoothly.\n\"Man, you really help me there. Honestly, I'm not good at high places.\"\n\"…It makes me wonder why you still dare to climb a tree when not good at high places.\"\n\"It can't be helped, my mind was too occupied helping this guy down.\"\nSo he said as he stroked the cat in his arms.\nIf he looked closely, the man surprisingly had a good-looking face, if nothing else.\nAs far as Cyril knows, the only person who excelled in appearance was the person he most respected, Felix Ark Ridill, but the man before him had the appearance that would not lose to his prince.\nHis rose-colored wavy hair and dark green eyes were especially beautiful, so beautiful that if someone told him he was the spirit of this rose garden, he would believe it.\nHe seemed to have similar age as Cyril. Wearing trousers with suspenders topped with a plain-colored shirt, a hand towel around his neck, and a straw hat on his head, an appearance that screams of a gardener.\nIn addition, despite the winter season, the man did not wear his jacket properly but wrapped it around his waist with his sleeves rolled up. Unlike his handsome face, the arms peeking out from the sleeves were muscular.\nFor Cyril who has never been able to build muscle no matter how hard he works out, his impressive muscle made him feel envious.\nWhen his beautiful face was paired with a muscular body and farm attire, it made his appearance seemed out of place.\nAs Cyril pondered this, the man smiled amiably as he stroked the cat.\n\"Are you attending the New Year Ceremony? It's rare to find someone as young as you. Which family heir are you from?\"\nCyril was a bit miffed when asked with a frank tone but still replied.\n\"I'm the oldest son of Marquis Highon, Cyril Ashley.\"\n\"Marquis Highon!?\"\nThe man's eyes sparkled at Cyril's words, and his smile widened.\n\"I've always been indebted to the Marquis Highon. He invested a lot in our project.\"\n\"My father did?\"\n\"Yeah, did you see these flowers?\"\nThe man looked at the garden which was full of blooming flowers as if ignoring the changing season.\n\"Our family had been tending this garden for generations.\"\nHis tone when talking about the garden sounded somewhat proud and his eyes were sparkling with excitement.\n\"Are you wondering why there are so many flowers blooming here when it's not inside a greenhouse? Actually, there's a secret to all of this. It's the fertilizer, we mixed the fertilizer with mana.\"\n\"What? Doesn't the country prohibit the act of injecting mana into plants and animals?\"\n\"More accurately, the country prohibits the act of injecting mana into living things within a certain limit that would not harm the human body. In other words, it's allowed as long as it doesn't exceed that limit.\"\nJust as humans are born with a specific amount of mana, animals and plants also possess a bit of mana. Apparently, he had been experimenting with a way to strengthen the plant by changing the ratio of elements that make up its mana without increasing its capacity.\n\"If a human has 100 points of mana, then this flower will have 1 point of mana. In order not to exceed that 1 point of mana, we adjust that subtle balance of mana in 0.01% increments through fertilizers. In doing so, we can create varieties that are resistant to cold, and these flowers are the prime example. Right now it's just the houseplants in this garden, but eventually, we'd like to be able to do the same thing with other plants.\"\nCyril was honestly impressed by his explanation. Now he understood why his adoptive father was investing in this project.\nIf this cultivation development allows vegetables and medicinal herbs to be grown on rough land, it will contribute greatly to solving the food problem and medicine shortages.\n\"…it's very groundbreaking, indeed.\"\n\"It's actually not as easy as it sounds. Most of them ended up failures. Even the slightest mistake will cause the soil to accumulate too much mana, making it unusable, and as a result, the plants are dying. Plus, we have to examine whether the altered vegetable would affect the human body. And our country is lagging behind in this regard.\"\nIndeed, taking an excessive amount of mana can be harmful to the body. Cyril, who had this illness, had learned the hard way before understanding this fact.\nEspecially applying that method to something edible, it must have taken an enormous amount of time and effort before it can be consumed safely.\nIn all honesty, Cyril wanted to support this project.\n\"This research is quite brilliant. Perhaps when famine and other food shortages arrive at some point, we can save tens of thousands of lives with this research.\"\n\"I'm happy to hear the future Marquis Highon praising our project!\"\nAs he grinned cheerfully showing his white teeth, he took a thin carrot from his pocket and offered it to Cyril.\n\"As a token of our friendship, I'll give you these vegetables from my garden! Oh, they're cultivated with regular fertilizer, so you don't have to worry about its side effect!\"\n\"I appreciate the gesture, but I would have to refuse since I have to the castle later.\"\n\"You can eat it here if you want.\"\nSo said the man as he bit the raw carrot like candy.\nHis face might look like a prince that many girls had dreamed of, but his mannerism was completely crude.\n\"Anyway, do you still have any spare time? It's rare to have the future Marquis visit here. If it's okay with you, I can show you around the garden.\"\n\"…well, if you insist.\"\nCyril hesitated for a bit before deciding to take the man's offer.\nIn fact, he found his stories quite intriguing, but more than anything, talking to this friendly man made him feel a lot less nervous.\nThe man with a cat in his arms gave a smile to Cyril before he walked through the garden as he continued munching on a carrot.",

      "content": "The gardener, with a cat in his arms, spoke in a sunny tone.\n\"You see, my ancestor was a scary person to even feared by the king in that era. And this garden was created by my ancestor as a request from the king himself.\"\nIt would be a huge matter if there was a gardener that was even feared by the king.\nAssuming it was probably this gardener's exaggeration, Cyril silently listened to the rest of the story.\n\"Did you know? Nobles in those days did not have the custom of using toilets, so they used to do their business in flowerbeds. You know how women used to say, ‘I'm going to pick a flower' when they went to the toilet? Some say the origin of this phrase comes from that.\"\nWhy are we suddenly talking about toilets?\nCyril frowned at his lack of decency, but the gardener continued to speak without concern.\n\"Because of this custom, he was so angry when he found his garden full of excrement! In his fury, so he built a magnificent toilet in the castle and made an announcement to anyone who dare to soil the garden again, he would crush, mix, and bury them with fertilizer. After that, no one had ever done their business in the flowerbed but a toilet.\"\n\"………\"\n\"Long after that day, having a nice toilet in the mansion become a status symbol for nobility, so they began to build their own toilets. This culture passed gradually, from the servants to the commoners, and now you can find it in the commoner's house as well.\"\nCyril, who was about to run out of patience, interrupted him, glaring at the gardener with cold eyes.\n\"Is that something you would talk about while giving a tour of the gardens?\"\n\"Well, hear me out. A few decades after the toilet culture took root in the Ridill Kingdom, a worldwide epidemic broke out. But why did the epidemic not spread in the Ridill Kingdom? Because we had a proper system for managing excrement. Thus, the concept of sanitation spread around the Ridill Kingdom and spread throughout the world. That's how the incident ended.\"\nWell, the story ended up surprisingly sound.\nBut how did the topic leap from the flowerbeds to the toilet?\nThe gardener proudly said to Cyril, whose face was inexplicable.\n\"So as a person who built a magnificent toilet to protect the flowerbeds, I think the name ‘Toilet Witch' suits my ancestors better. As such, you can call me the fifth ‘Toilet Witch'!\n\"The fifth? Witch?\"\n\"If you ever go to the castle, check out the toilet my ancestors built. It was really amazing. Each of the toilet cubicles is about the size of a private laboratory, and it's absolutely gorgeous. I was so impressed when I used the castle's toilet for the first time.\"\nAs the gardener spoke vigorously about the toilet, the cat in his arms meowed as if it had noticed something.\nThe gardener man turned his eyes across the garden and gave a big wave to a figure he could see in that direction.\n\"Oh, it's my pal over there! Hey! Hey!\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAt first, Ray Albright the Abyss Shaman was in a good mood, thinking of having a walking date in a lovely garden, but the moment he stepped into the garden, his posture slumped over, leaning his weight to his cane listlessly.\nMonica felt concerned when she saw him just like a wanderer whose body was about to run out of steam, but in response, Ray spoke.\n\"…The sunlight is melting me… I don't feel any love from it…\"\n\"It's winter, though. So the sunlight should have not been that strong.\"\n\"Perhaps I'm just feeling sleepy… Since I've been up late doing an investigation…\"\nMonica stilled when he mention ‘investigation' and then asked Ray in a hushed voice.\n\"Do you mean by ‘investigation'… is it about that item…?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nAs he said that, Ray pulled out a goldsmith ornament with a black stone attached from his pocket—a magic tool that Peter Sams used before his death.\nFrom the look of it, Ray seemed to have thoroughly examined this magic tool for her.\nRay put the magic tool in her hand and checked his surrounding to make sure there were no people around before he whispered.\n\"This is the kind of magic tool that manipulates living things by implanting the curse within its body to deprive its mind, allowing the caster to control it at will.\"\n\"Manipulates… living things?\"\nMonica raised her brows when hearing such unexpected words from him, but Ray added more in a lower tone.\n\"Albeit, it ended up a failure. To make it able to control living things, you need a stronger curse than the target. But if you made the curse too strong, it will only result in the subject dying eaten away by the curse and making it uncontrollable, which is different from the initial intention. To put it simply, the poison in this item was too strong for it to be usable.\"\n\"That surprised me a little. To think there would be a curse that is able to control living things… I have never thought it exists.\"\nMonica herself was not an expert in curses, but if she was given a choice, she would choose to use mind-type spells to manipulate someone.\nAnd Ray nodded solemnly, seeming to have the same thought as her.\n\"Right, it's common practice, witchcraft is usable for tormenting prisoners and restricting criminals' movement. In fact, having someone coming up with the idea of controlling people with witchcraft was almost unthinkable.\"\nRay pulled the hood of his robe over his eyes and muttered in a low voice as his jewel-like pink eyes flickered under the hood.\n\"But, in the recent day, someone has asked me for opinions on controlling living creatures through witchcraft.\"\n\"…huh?\"\nMonica was caught in surprise as she raised her brows, and Ray continued.\n\"That person was the second prince, Felix Ark Ridill.\"\nBlood drained from Monica's entire body.\n\"Did he do it on the order of Duke Reinberg Household?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nThe scattered pieces within Monica's mind were slowly linked together. And perhaps it would develop in the worst possible result.\nAnd as if confirming Monica's prediction, Ray spoke.\n\"I also did some digging on Peter Sams' identity and found out that he was an apprentice to a magician in our Albright branch family. When I asked him about Peter Sams, he told me that he has been studying witchcraft there for about ten years ago, but later disappeared for no reason… From what I heard, in his brief disappearance, he has been serving under Duke Crockford.\"\nDuke Crockford is Felix's maternal grandfather and is one of the most influential people in the kingdom.\nIt was as Hilda said. There's a powerful person standing behind him.\nCasey also told her that Felix was Duke Crockford's puppet.\nWas Duke Crockford the person whom Peter sold my father to? I wonder if this person was also involved in my father's death.\nAssuming Peter, Duke Crockford, and Felix were connected to each other, there could only be one possible worst conclusion.\n\"Don't tell me, the whole cursed dragon incident also…\"\nAs Monica hesitated to continue with her words, Ray muttered in a low voice.\n\"…yes, it's highly likely the whole incident was set up by Duke Crockford.\"\nDuke Crockford had ordered Peter Sams to turn the Green Dragon into a cursed dragon through a curse.\nThe plan was to manipulate the cursed dragon and have Felix exterminate it at the appropriate time.\nHowever, Peter's curse failed and the cursed dragon went berserk.\nAlthough Peter had achieved his goal with Felix defeating the dragon and resulting in the prince being regarded as a hero who protected the kingdom from the dragon, unfortunately, he did not anticipate the dragon would go berserk.\nOf course, all of these were only Monica's assumptions.\nBut, if all these events were proven to be true, it would be difficult to pursue this matter against Peter Sams. After all, what stood behind him was the most influential noble in the kingdom. His words had more weight than the speech of the Seven Sages.\nWas Duke Crockford the person who set up the whole cursed dragon incident? Moreover, it's highly possible he was involved in the death of my father. Also, how much does His Highness know about this matter?\nWhat If Felix had hidden this horrifying truth behind his beautiful smile?\nWhat if he had known all about it and was still following Duke Crockford's order?\n…how scary.\nThe thought of it had given Monica a chill that was different from the cold of winter's gust.\nWhen Ray looked at Monica rubbing her own arms over her robe, he spoke.\n\"We can't make any reckless move if Duke Crockford was involved in this matter.\"\n\"…I know.\"\n\"Just to let you know, I'll keep going with my investigation on Peter Sams.\"\n\"…okay.\"\nThey didn't have any direct evidence to prove Duke Crockford was the mastermind behind the cursed dragon incident.\nIn this situation where the corpse of the cursed dragon had dissolved and Peter, the perpetrator, has committed suicide, it will be difficult to pursue this matter against Duke Crockford.\nAs these bad feelings and her distrust in Felix keep growing, Monica trudged along with a gloomy face.\nDespite the beautiful flowers blooming in the castle gardens, Monica didn't feel like making any spare time to enjoy them. Her heart just felt heavy when she thought about Felix's standing.\nThe two of them, Ray, who usually has a gloomy air about him, and Monica, who was now feeling downcast, just like a parade of the departed, walked in robes surrounded by the gloomy air. It was the sight that was most unlikely to happen in the gorgeous garden.\nIn such a situation, there was a man who shouted ‘Hey! Hey!', calling the two over.\nA familiar voice that seemed to belong to the Thorn Witch. Ray, who heard such a cheerful voice that suits in a bright place under the sun, clicked his tongue in a gloomy face.\n\"I don't like that guy, he's so noisy and always forcing me to eat his vegetables…, I especially hate his looks… how envious, how envious, how envious…\"\nSo cursed Ray in muttering, but his mumbling didn't reach Monica's ear.\nIt was because Monica's eyes were glued to the young man behind the Thorn Witch.\nHis platinum blonde hair and deep blue eyes which were stood out even from a distance. A slender body with a face that could be called beautiful even from a woman's perspective.\nLord Cyriiiil!?\nMonica was so shaken up that she almost inadvertently dropped her scepter.",

      "content": "Cyril involuntarily rubbed his eyes and looked twice at the scene before him.\nThe gardener shouted at the two figures matching in robes whom he called ‘my pals'.\nHe can't see their face clearly since it was covered by the hood, but he could tell they were a slender man and a petite woman.\nAnd one thing that should be taken into consideration was the robes they were wearing. It was the kind of formal robe made of dark blue fabric with embroidered gold and silver threads that only the kingdom's best magician, the Seven Sages, was allowed to wear.\nThe gardener run over to the two with a cat in his arms.\n\"Hey, it's rare to see you guys out in the garden!\"\nIn response, the robed man whispered in a listless voice.\n\"…We came all the way here to pick you up since we know you wouldn't show up in the Jade Room no matter how long we wait.\"\n\"Is that so? Well, sorry for making you take this trip. Thanks anyway! Oh, wanna have some vegetables?\"\n\"No, thanks.\"\nThe gardener clicked his mouth, and this time he took out a turnip and munched at it.\nNow Cyril has realized.\nThe robe that tied to the gardener's waist was made of dark blue fabric too. If he looked closely, he could see some embroidery made of gold and silver threads.\nSpeaking of the Jade Room, it was the room only that only the Seven Sages and the King himself are allowed to enter.\nFurthermore, with the fact they wore robes that only the Seven Sages are permitted to wear, he arrived at one conclusion.\n\"The fifth… Witch…? Could it be he's the Thorn Witch…\"\nThe gardener, Raul Roseberg the Thorn Witch, widened his eyes in surprise when he heard Cyril mutter those words.\n\"Wait. I thought you've already known my identity…\"\nAs Raul munched on his turnip, the gloomy-robed man spoke listlessly.\n\"…it's obvious because you haven't worn your robe.\"\n\"Oh, now that you mention it. I took off this robe since it only got in the way when working in the garden. Can you hold this guy for a moment?\"\nAs Raul said so, he shoved the kitten to the robed man, unfolded his own robe which was tied to his waist, and properly wore his robe this time.\nAnd when the gardener with such a handsome face wore the Seven Sages' robe properly, he exuded an overwhelming air of dignity.\nBoth his rosy wavy hair and mysterious green eyes shone brightly against his dark blue robes.\n——Unfortunately, he still wore clothes for farming work, a straw hat on his head, and a hand towel on his neck.\nBesides, who would imagine a man who tended the garden clad in field clothes, couldn't climb down from a tree, forces anybody he meets to eat his vegetable, and proclaims himself the descendant of the Toilet Witch be one of the Seven Sages?\nCyril was lost for words while Raul Roseberg the Thron Witch smiled back in response and spoke.\n\"That's right! Let me introduce my pals to you! This gloomy guy over here is Abyss Shaman and the little one here is Silent Witch! Together, we are the Three Young Seven Sages!\"\nAt Raul's words, the Abyss Shaman said ‘…don't include me in your strange group' disgruntedly, while the Silent Witch, just like her name, kept quiet with hanging head.\nAre these guys really the Seven Sages…? The best magician in the kingdom…?\nHe almost couldn't believe the people in front of him were the Count Magicians, direct advisors of the King.\nRecalling back how he acted toward him, he wondered if his behavior had been rude.\nIf he compares their rank, Cyril's family background, Marquis Highon House, had a higher standing than the Count Magician, which is equivalent to the rank of count.\nBut Count Magician is a peerage that cannot be described simply like that. Subjects who were given those ranks were allowed to have a direct audience with the king, which was incomparable to that of a normal count.\nIf he thinks about it further, he was just the adopted son of Marquis Highon. So the one who clearly had to keep his manner was Cyril himself.\nSo, with his blood almost drained from his face, Cyril tried to apologize to them. But before he could do that, the Abyss Shaman approached him with silent footsteps and held his hand.\nThe pale face of the Abyss Shaman that peered from the hood was somewhat ecstatic.\nFrom lips that almost looked like a sick person, he whispered in a hoarse voice.\n\"…do you love me?\"\nCyril was stupefied, dead silent for almost a good ten seconds.\nFollowing this, he asked again expressionlessly.\n\"…I'm sorry, I might have heard it wrong. But, could you tell me once again?\"\n\"Do you love me?\"\nCyril staggered, he didn't hear it wrong! No, this person must have misunderstood something here, it must be like that!\nAs Cyril desperately told himself this over and over, the Abyss Shaman's pink eyes which were almost unreal, shone brightly as they came closer.\n\"Don't you think our meeting in the rose garden is like destiny? Of course, if destiny is true, should we be attracted to and loved each other? Meeting a beautiful girl disguised in men's clothes… great, that's the best!\"\n\"Girl? Disguised?\"\nCyril was lost for words, and the Abyss Shaman, as if trying to give him some assurance, continued.\n\"Please rest assured. What's important is not how big your boobs are, but how big our love is. So… do you love me? It's fine to have small boobs, so can you say ‘I love you' to me?\"\nDon't tell me, this… this… this man is…\nAs Cyril's cheeks twitched, the Silent Witch pulled the Abyss Shaman's sleeve and whispered something to his ear.\n\"Huh? He's not? A man?\"\nThe Silent Witch's head which was covered with the hood was nodding.\nAs the Abyss Shaman tilted his head in puzzled, staring hard at Cyril's face, Raul Roseberg the Witch Thorn interrupted.\n\"He really is. There's nothing to doubt when he's the son of Marquis Highon.\"\nAt Raul's words, the Abyss Shaman staggered down in place and mumbled ‘I feel like throwing up…' or that kind of rude words.\nCyril was dumbfounded.\nThe Thorn Witch didn't seem to care about anything, just playing with the cat while the Silent Witch was flustered with the situation.\nThey are the Seven Sages? The so-called best magician in the kingdom?\nThe Abyss Shaman seemed to have a few loose screws, the Thorn Witch only cares about farming, and the Silent Witch was just like a child.\n…wait, a child?\nIf he looked closely at her, she clearly had a petite figure. She was just like a kid wearing an oversized robe. Perhaps she tried doing her best in her own way since her hands were flailing around. But those hands which didn't have any gloves put on were red from the cold.\nAs Cyril stared at her hands, the Silent Witch turned her face down in fluster and began to fidget with her fingers.\nAnd those minute gestures stirred some of Cyril's memory.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nYou don't have to be depressed, Lord Cyril! You're a still man! I can tell your body frames and the shape of your throat are different from a woman's!\nMonica was flailing her hands around as she tried hard to voice her words to the misunderstood Ray.\nIf we're talking about the Serendia Academy, there's no one who would mistake Cyril Ashley for a woman, but… If it was the Seven Sages, there might be some of them who would make such a mistake.\nNo matter how you look at him! Lord Cyril! Is a proper man!\nNaturally, she didn't say it out loud, since she could only flap her hands around, but she then felt Cyril's eyes fixed on her.\nLord Cyril's watching me… my identity hasn't been exposed, has it? It's fine, he still doesn't know, he still doesn't know…\nAs she was pondering while fidgeting her freezing fingers, Cyril raised his brows slightly.\n\"Please pardon me if I'm wrong, Lady Silent Witch.\"\n\"………\" *on alert*\nWhile Monica held her breath as she took a step back, Cyril spoke.\n\"…have we met before…?\"",

      "content": "\"Have we met before…?\"\nMonica was stiffened at Cyril's question when the loud shout interrupted his words.\nAs if it resounded from the depths of the earth, Cyril's words were easily drowned by its loud voice.\n\"Heeeeeeeeeeeyyyyyy! Gentlemen over there! Please help me catch those caaaaatttss!\"\nTurning their heads toward the voice, they can see two white cats similar to the cat in Raul's hands, running toward them.\nChasing the cats was a man with blond hair and stern blue eyes with a figure as big as a gorilla. Probably frightened by that man, those two cats were slipping away through the trees in the garden with their hairs standing on end.\nMonica turned her eyes to Raul and Ray, but the former who was stroking the cat in his hands, and the latter who still remained on the ground, answered at the same time.\n\"Sorry, my hand is tied up right now.\"\n\"It's not like my curse can do anything about it…\"\nApparently, these two didn't have any intention to help him.\nBut the ever-serious Cyril seemed genuinely determined to catch the running cats. But just as Cyril extended his arms, the cat used his shoulder as a stepping stone before it swiftly landed on the ground behind him.\nAnd the big blond man also seemed to have a hard time chasing the other cat.\nIf he keeps cashing like this, he will never catch the cats, no matter how hard he tries.\nW-What should I do… *fidgeting*\nMonica turned her eyes to Ray and Raul for help, but she only received an expectant look in return. She seemed to have no other choice.\nMonica let out a small sigh and tapped the ground with her scepter.\nAs her targets were the two cats, she needs to grasp their positions first.\nI need to make sure my spell didn't catch Lord Cyril and the big man…\nIt may seem like a simple task, but it's surprisingly harder to catch a target that moves so quickly. In fact, it's far easier to blow the target away with a tornado spell.\nAfter carefully calculating the target positions, Monica cast her wind spell without chanting.\nThe wind that swirled up from the ground gently enveloped the cats and lifted them up. The cats were meowing and flapping their legs, but Monica guided them into her arms before she released her spell.\n\"…ugh…\"\nThe moment Monica took the cats into her arms, the aftereffect of the Cursed Dragon's incident in her left hand stung slightly. Although the bruise has faded considerably, the pain was still present, while her strength of grip had barely returned.\nAs Monica was struggling to hold the cats with only her right arm so as to not drop them, Cyril quickly picked the two cats from her hand.\n\"…tha-\"\nOut of habit, Monica almost reflexively uttered, ‘Thank you, Lord Cyril,' but in haste, she shut her mouth.\nT-That almost gave me away…\nWith just one word from her mouth, her identity as the Silent Witch would be exposed.\nAs Monica was hanging her head while holding her left arm, Cyril with the two cats in his arms, looked at Monica worriedly.\n\"Does your left hand still hurt?\"\n\"………\"\nMonica retraced her left hand into the hem of her robe and muttered ‘I'm fine' internally while shaking her head.\nCyril looked at Monica in doubt, but when the cats in his arms began to lash out, he hurriedly handed over the cats to the large man who seemed to be their owner.\nThe man took the cats and bowed to Cyril with a grateful face.\n\"Thank you! You're a live saver!\"\nThe cats seemed startled by his loud voice.\nRaul, who had been stroking the cat leisurely until now, spoke.\n\"Your Highness, I think your loud voice makes the cats got startled and ran away.\"\n\"Truly!? I-I see… I'm sorry to have startled you, Adrian, Christopher.\"\nThe big man apologized to the cats in his arms, and they meowed in response as if they understood his words. The big man took out a dried small fish from his pocket and feed it to the cats in his arms.\nHuh? Wait… Did Lord Thorn Witch just call him His Highness?\nThe big man had a stern face but when he looked at the cat in Raul's hand, his stern face loosened.\n\"Oh, you were there, Rodvig. Thank you for always helping me, Sir Thorn Witch.\"\n\"Your Highness' cat has a habit of running away, after all. Oh, is it perhaps there are three cats?\"\n\"Indeed.\"\nRaul handed the cat in his arms when the big man nodded in response. The big man's arms were thick and muscular like logs, so when he held the three cats in his arms it didn't look unstable.\nNow the three cats were in his arms, he then turned his eyes to Cyril.\n\"I apologize for causing you so much trouble. My dear mother cherishes these cats so much. So I can't thank you enough for helping me catch these cats.\"\nCyril was visibly flustered when the large man politely thanked him.\n\"N-No, it's not a problem at all, Your Highness Lionel.\"\nNow that Cyril mentioned His Highness's name, Monica had just realized.\nThat's right, this big muscular man was the first prince and also a half-brother of Felix Ark Ridill–Lionel Brehm Edward Ridill.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nCyril was so shaken up that even his hands under his gloves felt colder than usual.\nEver since his father announced that he would be invited to the castle, he figured he would see Felix first, but never had he expected he would run into the first prince before him. Moreover, he was meeting him in this kind of situation.\nWhile Cyril himself was of the second prince's faction, which believes that Felix is the most suitable candidate to ascend the throne, that does not mean he could afford to show disrespect to the first prince.\nIn the first place, his belief in supporting Felix is only his personal decision, it did not represent the house of Marquis Highon which is in a neutral faction.\nAfter desperately recalling how his conduct before in response to his words, Lionel then gave him a friendly smile.\n\"It's rare to see someone as young as you to be invited to the New Year's Ceremony. If you don't mind, may I ask your name?\"\n\"My name is Cyril Ashley, the heir of Highon Family.\"\nCyril answered with a tense voice in nervousness, in response Lionel returned with an ‘Oh!' as his eyes lit up. While he seemed like a stern person, it also gave an impression of amicable.\nPeople always say His Highness Lionel's big figure resembles a gorilla, but his rounded eyes only make him more amiable. Of course, Cyril didn't have any room to pay attention to such a thing.\n\"So you were a member of Marquis Highon House. Lord Scholar's wisdom has always been a great help to us royal family. I hope you will also continue to lend your wisdom to royal family.\"\nSo Lionel said calmly, but Cyril could only shut his mouth.\nCyril was not the biological son of Marquis Highon, so it could not be said that he belongs to the Scholar Family.\nAs the Scholar Family itself is a family who has a vast amount of knowledge known as the walking library, the also can be said the brain of the Ridill Kingdom.\nCyril himself understood enough that he didn't have the wisdom to be called the heir of the family. Instead of him, Claudia who possesses such wisdom is more appropriate to be called the heir of the Scholar Family. If she had been a man, she would have been his successor without a doubt.\nCyril was getting nervous when His Highness Lionel had put great expectations on him. He knew he had to respond ‘It's a honor to receive such words' but his tongue was stiffened, unable to let out any word.\n\"…I don't know how far I can go while being inexperienced… but I will do my best to meet your expectation.\"\nThat was all Cyril can say right now.\nReally, what was I saying? If the royaty was putting great expecation on me, what I can do is making efforts to make their expectation!\nIn contrast to Cyril who turned cold, Lionel was smilling cheerfully.\n\"You don't have to get too worked up. I am a greenhorn myself. I may good at wileding a sword, but my diplomacy skill can be considered as poor. It's just as everyone says, my brother Felix is better than me.\"\n\"I…\"\n\"I, too, have the same thought as yours. I think Felix is more suitable to be king. But even if I cannot become king, I want to protect this kingdom with all my might. That is why I need your wisdom and assistance.\"\nJust right after he said that, they hear a voice of servant shouted ‘where are you, His Highness Lionel!?'.\nLionel flipped his cloak and walked toward the voice.\n\"Now, if you'll excuse me! Thank you for helping me catching this cats, Lord and Lady Seven Sages! And you too, future Marquis Highon, let us meet again!\"\nCyril bowed to Lionel as his back facing him.\nHe may differ from Felix, but he is also a royalty…\nLionel said ‘I hope you will also continue to lend your wisdom to royal family' to him.\nHe used the words ‘to royal family' instead of ‘to me', that itself had already signify Lionel's true intention.\nLionel is looking for the future of this kingdom.\nAs for the current situations, the kingdom is divided into two sides of the first prince's faction and the second prince's faction where they are facing against each other. As such, leaving an opportunity for the other counries to take advantage of.\nThat was probably why Lionel approached Cyril in this way, thinking that nobles in the kingdom must unite from now on.\nAt the very least, even he can't become king, he still can protect this kingdom.\n\"He's quite a charming prince, isn't he? He's easygoing and doesn't act arrogant. He knows what he can and can't do.\"\nThe Thorn Witch said as he brushed the cat hair off his robe.\nAfter a thoughtful pondering, Cyril asked the Thorn Witch.\n\"…do you support the first prince, Lord Thorn Witch?\"\n\"Well, as long as I find it interesting, I don't care whichever who become king. I think these two have the same opinion as me.\"\nSaying this, the Thorn Witch looked at the Silent Witch and the Abyss Shaman, but the former only turned her head down, fidgeted her finger as if she was troubled.\nAs for the Abyss Shaman, he was…\n\"The more handsome his face, the more I wish he walk into his downfall…\"\n…letting out his ranting.\nThe Thorn Witch was just laughing without care in response.\n\"Well, guess it's my fauilt for expecting the same opinion from the Seven Sages.\"\nSomehow when Cyril heard the Seven Sages, which also the brightest people in the kingdom as well as the advisor to the king, spoke like that, he felt something crumbing down inside. Especially his respect for the Seven Sages.",

      "content": "With the departure of Lionel, Cyril also gave a bow to Monica and the others and bid farewell.\nHe probably has made his adoptive father, Marquis Highon waited long enough.\n\"I hope you could forgive any fault you found in my conduct.\"\n\"It's okay, we don't mind it. Speaking of the rudest person, there's one over here.\"\nWhile Raul said that, his finger was pointed at Ray.\nRay was mumbling bitterly at the moment in crouching, still feeling devastated after knowing the person that he was trying to hook was a man.\nWhen he compared to the person he mention, Cyril's impolite might seemed trivial.\nThere are many things Cyril wanted to say, but he held back his word and cast his eyes down.\n\"…now, if you'll excuse me.\"\nJust before he went away, Monica seemed to feel Cyril's gaze on her—or to be precise on the Silent Witch.\nBut she had been covering her face with the hood and hadn't let out any voice in front of him, so it was unlikely for her identity to be exposed.\nI-I've been standing in this place too long…\nAs Monica secretly wiped her sweat from her forehead, she heard rattling sounds nearby. She saw Raul had brought a cart out of nowhere.\nRaul then stopped by Ray with a cart made of a simple wooden board with wheels and handles, after which he lifted Ray up with a heave-ho. While Ray looked so skinny, he was still an adult, it was not the weight an average magician could lift easily. Perhaps his days tending to the gardens had trained his muscles.\nAfter having Ray, who's hugging his leg, on the cart, he laughed briskly.\n\"Alright, we better head back too! You want a ride too?\"\n\"N-No, thank you… I'll walk on my own.\"\nAfter Monica declined his offer, Raul started to push forward the cart with Ray on it, and Monica also started walking, following behind him.\nRaul was humming as he walked among the flowerbeds when he suddenly remembered and looked back at Monica.\n\"Come to think of it, are you acquainted with the son of Marquis Highon?\"\n\"Eh!? Ah, N-n-n-n-n-n-no, I'm nhoh–!\"\n\"Really? You were trying so hard to follow up with me earlier, I thought you knew each other.\"\nOf the Seven Sages, the only people who know Monica is carrying out an undercover mission at Serendia Academy were Louis and Monica herself. Naturally, she couldn't allow another person to know this fact.\nMonica inwardly felt nervous, wondering what answer should she say to him if he inquires her further, but from the look of it, Raul seemed to have lost interest. He is just like a cat in his whimsical and likes to act without care.\nIt was when they reached one corner of a flower bed, Raul stopped his step and pulled a pair of small pruning shears from his pocket.\nHe then pruned one of the yellow roses, removed the thorns from the stalk, and offered it to Monica.\n\"Here, for you.\"\n\"T-Thank you…\"\nWhy did he suddenly give a rose to Monica?\nMonica was more confused than happy when receiving a friendly cat-like smile from Raul.\n\"To tell you the truth, I can hear the voice of plants.\"\n\"………what?\"\n\"I heard these roses is saying, ‘Silent Witch and Abyss Shaman was doing something interesting behind everyone…' to me.\"\nRaul said as he squinted his green eyes, and it was enough to send a shiver through her spine.\nIf one looked on the surface, Raul Roseberg seemed easygoing and jovial, but looking back at his background, besides his looks that he inherited from his ancestors, he was one of the magicians with the highest mana capacity in the kingdom, a super genius who became the head of the prestigious Resberg family at the tender age of 16.\nSo when such a man gave her a smile that emitted a bit of intimidation, it was enough to make Monica's entire body break out in a cold sweat.\nD-Did Lord Thorn Witch hear our conversation!?\nShe had never heard that Raul has the ability to hear plants' voices.\nBut when she thought of his moniker the second of the Founder Thorn Witch, there might be a possibility he is…\n\"…It was thoughtless of us to speak in this place. It's a sound-collecting spell.\"\nIt was Ray who blurted out in his crouching position in the cart.\nRay lazily got up, plucked a yellow rose from Monica's hand, and crushed it. With that simple act, the rose quickly dried up.\nRay possessed many curses that had been carved all over his body. He probably cast some of his curses to wither anything he touches temporarily.\nAnd having the ability to freely manipulate such many curses engraved in one's body alone proves he was the head Albright family.\nSpeaking status, Ray is also the head of a family whose prestige did not lose to the Roseberg family.\nAs Ray tossed the withered rose aside, he glared at Raul.\n\"All the plants in this garden have been constantly infused with your mana… I assume you used these flowers as a relay point to activate a sound-collecting formation to a high degree of accuracy.\"\nSound-collecting formation is used to gather any sound in the surrounding. While convenient for use in eavesdropping and other applications, it is extremely difficult to control.\nLynn, Louis' contracted spirit uses it occasionally, but it was possible because she is a high-ranking spirit that excels in mana manipulation.\nRaul shrugged with a disappointed look on his face as he tucked the pruning shears into his pocket.\n\"I guess I've been found out, huh. Still, calling it the ability to hear the voice of plants sounds more like Thorn Witch doesn't it?\"\n\"What are you up to? Depending on your answer, I might only put a curse to make your pinky toe stumble the corner of the desk once a day, \" said Ray as he raised his staff and Raul raised his hands in surrender.\n\"It's not my intention to hear your conversation. I just happened to be there while looking for cats. When I found Roderick up in the tree near His Highness, I wondered if the other two cats had been running away too, so I decided to hear the voice in the garden. It just so happened that I heard you talking.\"\n\"…how much did you hear?\"\n\"Around the part where the whole dragon incident might have been a farce set up by Duke Crockford… and also when Ray blabbering about how he didn't like me.\"\nTo Raul's brisk reply, Ray was, ‘This is why I don't like to be involved with this guy,' said with utter disgust on his face.\nMonica involuntarily shuddered as she clutched at her scepter.\nNow Raul knows that she has been snooping around about Duke Crockford.\nRaul is neither the first prince faction nor the second prince faction, in other words, he is what they call a neutral faction. Despite his position, he might not let Monica and Ray off the hook for seeking enemies against Duke Crockford.\n\"D-Do you intend to sell us out to the other Seven Sages?\"\n\"Well, I have no intention of doing that. I thought it'd be interesting, so I just wanted you guys to let me join the fun.\"\nMonica was somewhat taken aback by his usual easygoing answer, but Ray was eyeing Raul with wary eyes.\n\"I know really well these types of people… one moment they will give you affection and another moment they will betray you in an abrupt way…\"\n\"Not that I want to give you affection.\"\n\"…that's how they approach us, they want to drive us to the depth of despair by pretending to love us, only to be betrayed later. I know all the popular good-looking guys are like that. C-u-r-s-e-y-o-u…\"\n\"I guess you really disliked me, huh. I just wanted to have some fun. I mean, ‘Let's suppress the most powerful man in the kingdom!' doesn't that sound really cool?\" said Raul in an honest tone without any intention behind it, but Monica can't take his word for granted.\nMonica has not spent that much time with Raul, but even so, she somehow knows that he can be unpredictable. So, how far can she trust him, she has no idea.\nFor Monica, the case of the cursed dragon and Duke Crockford will lead to the truth of her father's death, and for Ray, it will help him preserve the honor of the Albright family.\nBut there is nothing for Raul to gain. At most, it only satisfies his curiosity.\nLooking at Monica and Ray's wariness, Raul lowered his brows slightly as he scratched his cheek.\n\"I think it would be a good deal for you two. I've been asked to tend Duke Crockford's garden occasionally, I can talk to his servants and even sneak inside the house if it's necessary… it's not bad, right?\"\nSpeaking of connection, Ray and Monica have no ties to Duke Crockford, so Raul's proposal sounded very tempting to them.\nStill, for better or worse, the timid and cautious Monica and Ray still could not trust Raul.\nAnd Raul was sulking when receiving their doubt.\n\"Ah, I can't take it anymore! Why are guys so paranoid!? Can't you guys not be too secretive!? I want to join your group too! People close to my age don't want to be my friend, scared when they heard my ancestor's name, and so I'm wondering if it was the other Seven Sages who were close to my age perhaps they could be my friend, but you two never show up to the summit! Now when I was able to meet you after a long time, I was determined to make you two my friends, but you are planning to do something all by yourselves! It's not fair!\"\nMonica and Ray couldn't help but wince.\nThere was no reflection of the Thorn Witch of the head of the Roseburg family in Raul's childish rant. He is just like a spoiled child…albeit older than Monica.\nWith a sullen look, Raul stared at Ray faithfully and said, \"…a loner who doesn't have a friend, should be a good person.\"\n\"W-Well… w-welcome to the group,\" said Monica awkwardly, and Ray who stood beside her strangely felt some sympathy for him. And Ray himself was ‘I did it!' striking a gut pose like a kid who manages to do something remarkable.",

      "content": "To take the place of the king who was ill and bedridden, the First Prince Lionel and his mother, Queen Vilma, managed the new year's ceremony which was able to be carried out smoothly.\nThe decorations and scale of the ceremony were not much different from previous years, but some of the greetings have been simplified.\nTaking her seat which have been specially prepared for the Seven Sages, Monica, with her hood pulled over her eyes, looked around surreptitiously to see the participants.\nUp on stage and delivering the new year's greetings in a cheerful voice was the First Prince, Lionel Brehm Edward Ridill. The man whom she had just met in the garden a few moments before.\nBehind him was where two queens sat. Queen Vilma, the mother of the first prince, and Queen Phyllis, the mother of the third prince.\nThe second prince's mother, Queen Irene, died soon after giving birth to Felix. Therefore, they are the only two queens in the country at present.\nQueen Vilma has reddish-brown hair and a dignified face. As the princess of the neighboring Kingdom of Randall, she seemed to have served in the front line, wielding a sword as a woman, thus having a much more muscular body than most men. It seems Prince Lionel took after his mother.\nIn contrast to Queen Vilma, the third prince's mother, Queen Phyllis has a petite figure as well as modest blonde hair. Before marrying into the royal family, she was the daughter of Marquis Ainsworth, but recently her family has begun to decline which puts her in a difficult position in many ways.\nAnd seated closest to the podium were Felix Ark Ridill, the second prince, and Albert Frau Robelia Ridill, the third prince.\nRecalling the bare minimum of knowledge that Raul had told her before the ceremony, Monica shifted her eyes to the side of Felix's seat.\nSeated closest to the royal family sat a male nobleman over sixty years of age. He had grayish-blond hair with a sharp look.\nHe is indeed Duke Crockford, Darius Knightley.\nMonica swallowed her saliva, letting the faces of the people in this place—or more accurately, the ‘numerical' measurement of their faces, burn into her eyes.\nUp until now, Monica has been indifferent to politics and has never tried to properly remember the faces of the people in this room. As a result, she entered Serendia Academy without knowing Felix's face, leading to a major blunder.\nSo what she needs to do first is to memorize the faces and names of the people here, and also to grasp their relationships with each other.\nAfter the ceremony concluded, the next procession is a banquet.\nSince there were far fewer female guests at the new year's ceremony, the atmosphere was more akin to a standing buffet party than a ball.\nThis may be the reason why more alcohol was served during the annual event than at a normal evening party, but not necessarily to the point where it was deemed impolite.\nAs they left the ceremony hall, Bradford, the Artillery Magician, spun his shoulders around and said, \"Man, finally the formalities are over. Now it's time to drink! Hey, Barrier Man! Let's have another drink competition!\"\n\"Oh, have you already forgotten about the disgraceful conduct of yours last year?\"\n\"Gahaha, I don't recall such a thing happening before!\"\nBradford didn't pay any regard to Louis's spiteful remarks. Half-shouldering him, he dragged Louis to the banquet hall.\nEmanuel, the Jeweled Magician, looked at them with mocking eyes, but when he saw some distinguished nobles come out of the ceremony hall, he plastered an amiable smile on his face and approached them.\nAs for Mary the Star Oracle Witch, she glanced at the three remaining young Seven Witch and spoke to them.\n\"I'll go to the venue after changing my clothes, but what about you guys?\"\n\"We'll go there as well, of course!\"\nMonica was shaking her head franticly, but Raul answered immediately, holding tightly to Ray's robe in his right hand and Monica's in his left.\n\"N-No, I-I think I will take my leave here…\"\n\"Of course, you two will come with me as well, right, Monica, Ray?\"\nThe moment Raul showed them his pure smile, Ray's expression changed into despair as if he had peeked into the depths of the darkness.\n\"He's already addressing me by my given name… This is why I dislike people who have no sense of distance…\"\n\"You can address me by my name too, Ray! We're friends after all.\"\nRaul slapped Ray's shoulder, resulting in his thin body slumping, and leaned against the wall effortlessly.\n\"F-R-I-E-N-D-S… is either colleague and camaraderie, but what makes them different from each other? And there's no relationship that I want except a love relationship. Besides, can you feel how terrible it is to have a friend whose face was more handsome than mine? In the first place, when a shaman like me attended the banquet, people tends to talk behind my back like ‘an ominous person on the auspicious occasion'… You know I hate it… I absolutely hate it… I wanna kill myself…\"\n\"It's alright, it's alright! You're just thinking too much!\"\nRaul walked away humming in a good mood, dragging Monica and Ray by their robes. He did not pay attention to them even when he heard Monica's mumbling and Ray's ranting.\n\"I-I don't think my mind can take it… I-It's just impossible for meeee… I wanna back to my roooom…\"\n\"Wannadiewannadiewannadiewannadiewannadiewannadiewannadiewannadiewannadie…\"\n\"Hahaha! You two sure so lively!\"\nThe only person in high spirits was Raul himself.\nLooking at the three, Mary the Star Oracle Witch sent them off with a gentle smile.\n\"I'm glad you've made some friends, Raul.\"\nI'm glad my decision to let him pick Monica and Ray from the garden was not in vain, so thought Mary in her mind.\nIt was just a concern of her love for beautiful boys who were worried about her former beautiful boy.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAfter being dragged to the banquet hall in trembling by Raul, Monica tried to shrink her body as much as possible behind Raul's back to hide. Incidentally, Ray was doing the same thing, so their body looked like stuck firmly in Raul's back.\nAaaaah! What should I do, what should I do…\nIt is very likely that she may run into Felix and Cyril at the banquet hall. Perhaps other students from the Serendia Academy may also be there.\nAnyway, she must leave this place as soon as possible…\n\"Lady Everett.\"\nHearing the pleasant voice bouncing with joy, Monica's hair on her body was standing on end.\nHiiieeeeek!\nAfter screaming internally, she tilted up his head a little bit, and she could see Felix's figure, eyes glistening, coming to her position at a quick pace.\nNow Monica knew that Felix was somehow involved with Duke Crockford, it just makes him become the most person she must be wary of and also the last person she wanted to see.\n–Did you know what Duke Crockford did, Your Highness?\n–Have you ever wondered if Duke Crockford may have had anything to do with your father's –death?\nSuch questions run through Monica's head.\nHowever, Felix, oblivious to Monica's conflicting feelings, drew closer and smiled at her.\n\"I just wanted to thank you for your help in the Duchy of Reinberg. Has your left hand been better since then?\"\nNo matter where he was, Felix, the second prince, always stood out from the crowd. Naturally, all eyes were on Monica and the group.\nFurthermore, Felix and the Silent Witch are both heroes who defeated the cursed dragon in Reinberg.\nThe gazes directed at the two ranged from admiration to a mixture of political machinations.\nHaving been the center of attention as never before, Monica was about to have a mental breakdown.\nAnyway…011235…somehow…81321345589…I have to leave this place at once…144233377610987… aaaah, I want to escape to the number world…!\nAs Monica was half crying under her hood, Ray was chanting something in a whisper and pointed secretly at Monica.\nThen an eerie pattern appeared on Monica's left arm and glowed. The light disappeared in a few seconds, but it had enough impact on the observer.\nMonica jolted up her own left hand, and Felix turned pale.\n\"Lady Everett! Did the curse from the cursed dragon still…\"\nAs Felix grew paler, Ray rolled up Monica's left sleeve and said with the most convincing look on his face can make.\n\"Yes, she needs to go back to her room and get some rest.\"\nSuch a blatant lie. While her left hand still hurts, that mysterious luminescence was most likely a bluff. Ray made up an excuse for her to escape from the situation.\nLord Abyss Shaman… Thank you so much!\nAfter expressing her thanks to Ray mentally, Monica pressed her left hand over her robe as if it was in pain and turned away, bidding Felix farewell.\n\"Please hold on, Lady Everett. I'll ask someone to accompany you to the…\"\nMonica shook her head bumblingly and ran at full speed away from the scene battered.\nRunning through the banquet hall would have been a very unsightly thing to do at a ball, but since most of the guests at today's banquet were drunk, no one faulted her actions.\nI'm almost there… the exit…\nIn terms of physical, she is really in need of exercise, but she made her way to the exit with a rough breath.\n\"…uh… ha… haa…\"\nThe smell of alcohol made her dizzy, and she bumped into someone walking ahead of her.\nMonica, who had fallen on her buttocks, tried to apologize to the other party as quickly as she could but stopped herself from speaking.\nBecause she was too surprised, she didn't realize the air she inhaled did not smell like alcohol, but cool and refreshing.\n\"Pardon me. Are you hurt?\"\nCyril Ashley was reaching out his hand to Monica.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nIf this scene were to happen in the Serendia Academy in the same situation right now, Cyril would probably be scolding Monica as he raises his eyebrows and says, ‘don't run in the corridor!'\nBut the current Cyril standing in front of her was a gentleman who was reaching out his hand to help her.\nAs she grab his hand timidly, Cyril gently helped Monica to stand up.\n\"I presume you are… Lady Silent Witch?\"\nCold sweat broke out all over her body. Despite her will wanting to calm down, her body was shaking on its own.\n\"I may be presumptuous to ask this out of the blue, but… have we met somewhere before?\"\nA polite words with a good mannerisms. Such statements were obviously never meant for Monica Norton but for Monica Everett the Silent Witch.\nMonica is aware, sooner or later when she left the Serendia Academy, she would meet her acquaintance from the school, not as Monica Norton but as the Silent Witch. She already knows it. She already knows it's bound to happen.\nEven then…\n…I hate it.\nShe feels the same way when it happened in the garden.\nHer chest felt like has been prickled by needles when she saw Cyril treats her like a stranger…\nFelix's friendly attitude towards her, the Silent Witch, may be shocking in a different way, but when it comes from Cyril, she felt something different.\n…I hate it when Cyril treats me as a stranger.\n\"Lady Silent Witch?\"\nPerhaps Cyril was thinking Monica was not feeling well when he saw her hanging her head down, so he tried to look at her face with concern.\nBut the fear of being treated as a stranger has enveloped all her body.\nI hate it, I hate it, I hate it.\nShouting the voiceless words, Monica pushed Cyril with both hands.\nNot only her injured left hand had made her lose her strength, but she also can't even move Cyril's body when she pushed him. Still, Cyril sensed Monica desperately pushing him with both hands, and he backed off a little.\nAnd suddenly the pain enveloped her left hand.\n\"…o-ow.\"\nHer weak grunt escaped from her mouth as Cyril looked surprised, and afterward, she run past him.\nCyril was astonished as he looked at Monica run away but did not chase after her. Even then, Monica paid him no heed and kept running.\n\"Haah… Haah… Haah…\"\nShe kept running down the hallway even after reaching the exit of the banquet hall.\nEventually, she can't run anymore as her strength reached its limit, so she leaned her hand on the wall and slumped down to her knees.\nI should have understood.\nMonica Norton is just her fake persona.\nOnce she leaves the Serendia Academy, Monica will no longer be able to interact with Cyril and her acquaintances from the school the same way she has in the past.\nThat's why she decided to make many precious memories at the Serendia Academy and keep them in her heart for the rest of her life.\nBut when she saw Cyril treat her as a stranger, her blood ran cold. She felt like her heart is pricked by needles.\nShe wants the usual Cyril who always scolds her.\nI know I'm being greedy.\nMonica slowly reorganized her breath as she was raising her head from looking down, but then she felt a sudden presence from behind.\nWhat would she do if it was another of her acquaintance from the school, thought to herself while turning her head with trepidation, only to find a man she did not recognize standing there, who appeared to be a servant.\n\"Do you have a moment, Lady Silent Witch? My master, Lord Crockford, would like to speak with you in his private quarter.\"\n\"………yes?\"\nShe finally calmed her heart down, but it began thumping against her will.\nShe could hear her heartbeat echo loudly from inside.\n–Duke Crockford. The most suspicious man who perhaps has caused the incident of the cursed dragon and the death of Monica's father.\nThis is her chance to get closer to the truth.\nShe clutched the robe in her chest with her right hand and took a slow breath before saying, \"…Okay, I'll meet him. Please lead the way.\"",

      "content": "Special thanks to Ko-fi Supporter and Miti for the donation! Thank you!🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️\nThe servant of Duke Crockford led her to the most opulent guest room. A room befitting of the most powerful figure in the kingdom.\n\"Master, I have brought Lady Silent Witch with me.\"\n\"Bring her inside.\"\nHis voice didn't sound too loud but strangely she could hear it clearly.\nThe servant opened the door and urged Monica to come inside.\nMonica adjusted her hood to make it properly over her head again and stepped into the room.\nInside, she saw a man over sixty years old with blond hair mixed with gray, sitting on the sofa. He was Duke Crockford.\n\"Thank you for willing to spare your time, Miss Silent Witch.\"\nDuke Crockford said shortly and urged Monica to take the seat across from him.\nOnce Monica took her seat, the servant made tea for the two and left the room. At the same time, she felt like there is some kind of barrier formed in the room. Perhaps it was a soundproofing barrier to prevent eavesdropping.\nShe did not touch the tea that had been prepared at all but only observed Duke Crockford under her hood.\nEven in his old age, she could see the resembles of Felix's good-looking appearance in his youth.\nHowever, different from Felix who always put a calm and friendly smile on his face, Duke Crockford had some kind of dignity and solemnity that make anyone who is facing him would feel shudder.\n–This is the most powerful figure in the kingdom.\nJust by simply sitting down and facing him had made her feel like being swallowed by his pressure. But she clenched her fists on her knees to at least hold her stomach pain and keep her body from shaking.\nDuke Crockford didn't touch his tea as well, but he looked at Monica sharply and opened his mouth.\n\"You won't take off your hood even when sitting with me, huh?\"\nJust hearing him say that made her want to take off her hood and flatly apologize. That's how intimidating his voice was.\nEven then, Monica did not make any move and continued to stare at him from under the hood. And the duke didn't say any more than that.\nTime passed without a single word being spoken between them.\nDuke Crockford squinted languidly.\n\"‘In public, only the king's crown, the clergyman's cap, and the court magician's robe shall be formal attire' …I see, you have not disobeyed any of the rules of etiquette. A wise decision.\"\nShe felt like she was being tested.\nIf Monica has resigned to his pressure and taken off her hood, Duke Crockford would have probably looked down on her. He might think of her as a little girl who would easily be swayed by some coercion.\nBut the truth is she was just too nervous to move and too afraid to take off her hood in front of people.\nWhile Monica froze like a statue, Duke Crockford laced his finger in his lap.\n\"So you keep your silent even when facing me, Miss Silent Witch.\"\nI'm sorry! I'm just too nervous to talk! If I speak right now I'll bite my tongue for sure…!\nSome issues might appear if she were to say, ‘why did you call me here?'. Especially to her tongue.\n\"It's alright. I'm the one who called you here. Let's get straight to the main point.\"\nT-Thank goodness… we can start to get down to business…\nShe felt like she was already fraying her nerves before getting down to the main topic. As Monica patted her chest in her mind, Duke Crockford continued his speak indifferently.\n\"First of all, I would like to express my gratitude and respect to you for standing up to the threats that have threatened our Ridill Kingdom in recent years… especially the Black Dragon Wogan and the Cursed Dragon of Reinberg.\"\n\"………\"\nMonica had mixed feelings when she heard this. After all, it's not like she had exterminated the Black Dragon Wogan, and as for the cursed dragon in Reinberg, she suspected the duke has some involvement behind the incident.\n–Isn't the whole cursed dragon incident initiated by you?\nShe hesitated for a moment before she stopped expressing her thoughts.\nThe man in front of her has better communication than Felix. Even though she puts some bait, she didn't think he would take it. If anything, it would only expose her cards.\nThe only people who know that the cursed dragon incident was initiated by someone is Lord Abyss Shaman and me… It's better to keep this information to ourselves.\nIf she carelessly let some hint out even for a bit, he would be able to figure out all of their information. With just one mistake, all her actions pointing to suspect Duke Crockford would be exposed. Therefore, silence is the best move for now. At the moment, she needs to find out why Duke Crockford called her.\n\"I have a request that requires you, the best magician in the kingdom, needs to be fulfilled.\"\nA request?\nShe felt somewhat doubtful about this request, but the duke continued with his words.\n\"I want you to become the second prince, Felix Ark Ridill's personal guard.\"\nA thought crossed Monica's mind.\nI mean, that's what I'm doing until noooooooooow…\nShe was startled for a moment but then collected her thoughts. Duke Crockford does not know Monica's top-secret mission to guard Felix which requires her to infiltrate the Serendia Academy. Since the only people who know about this are Louis and the king himself.\nShe took any precarious to not show her agitation, but her thoughts were racing.\nWhat is Duke Crockford's intention for asking the Silent Witch to become Felix's personal guard?\n…is he perhaps want to bring me into the second prince faction?\nEven unwillingly, Monica was the most notable Seven Sages at present. She is the hero who defeated the two most evil dragons, the Black Dragon Wogan and the Cursed Dragon of Reinberg, and also the youngest Seven Sages.\nIn particular, since the cursed dragon was supposed to have been defeated after a joint battle between the second prince and the Silent Witch, people naturally assumed that there was no small amount of interaction between them. That is where Duke Crockford's attention was drawn.\nIf Monica officially becomes Felix's personal guard, regardless of which prince Monica actually supports, people will think that the dragon-slaying hero, the Silent Witch, has joined the second prince's faction.\nThe mere fact that the Silent Witch has accepted Duke Crockford's request and become the second prince's personal guard is enough to convince everyone that she had become a member of the second prince's faction.\nIf I'm talking about the second prince's faction, the Jeweled Magician is the only Seven Sages that had joined his faction… But if I took part in the second prince's faction, the power balance among the princes would crumble…\nOr perhaps that is what Duke Crockford wants.\n\"Would you like to accept it?\"\nAt the Duke of Crockford's request, Monica shook her head wordlessly.\nIn the first place, Monica has already received a direct order from the king to guard Felix. Under such circumstances, she could not possibly accept Duke Crockford's request.\nDuke Crockford just stared at Monica intently. It's not like he moved his eyebrow or frown, but she feel like the pressure on her becomes more heavy.\n\"I am aware the Seven Sages are direct subordinates of the king. And I am also aware only His Majesty can give orders to them… but with His Majesty's well-being not in good condition, I, with provisional authority that has been bestowed to me, am requesting to you on behalf of His Majesty.\"\nMonica is aware of that fact as well.\n…but, I'm certain His Majesty hasn't delegated his authority regarding the Seven Sages to him.\nThe Seven Sages held that much power within the kingdom. That is why they are respected by the nobles and princes.\nCurrently, Duke Crockford could be said the representative of the king himself, but even so, he does not have the authority to command the Seven Sages as he pleases. So he could only ‘ask' not ‘order'. Therefore, Monica has the right to refuse his request.\nMonica shook her head, implying she cannot accept his request, and Duke Crockford only looked at her silently without making any move.\nThe silent atmosphere felt so heavy as if her throat was being choked. Still, Monica endured it silently.\n\"I will grant you any wishes you desire. Just recently, there is some discussion to make the position of the Head of the Seven Sages to unite the Seven Sages. If you want, I could make that position yours.\"\nSupposing the position of the Head of the Seven Sages is officially established, it would be the king who would decide upon it, not him.\nAnd yet, he spoke so confidently, which can only mean one thing.\nThis man is planning to seize everything in this kingdom.\n\"Sooner or later, Felix will be the king of this kingdom. I will have Felix, the puppet who will obey everything that I say, appoint you as the Head of the Seven Sages.\"\nAt these words, everything in front of Monica became blank. It was as if her fury had swallowed everything before her.\nDriven by fury which was too lukewarm to be called an emotion, Monica got up from the sofa.\nTo make herself look as eerie as possible in the eyes of Duke Crockford, she moved as silently as possible without letting her anger out.\nAfterward, she lightly raised her right hand to activate her disarming magic, and the barrier, a soundproof barrier that prevented eavesdropping which had been in place since she entered the room, was dispersed.\nThe soundproof barrier was probably erected by the servant outside who guided Monica here. And the act of destroying the barrier forcibly only meant the negotiation was broken off.\nShe had expressed her intention. Afterward, she only needs to leave the room quietly.\n…but on the contrary, she turned her head to Duke Crockford and said with a fury which was very unlikely coming from Monica.\n\"My wish is… not something you can fulfill.\"\nIf anything, Monica has only one wish for this heartless duke. And it was… to bring the whole truth coming to light.\n–Are you the one behind the cursed dragon incident?\n–Are you involved in my father's death?\n–How come His Highness would obey all your orders?\nEven though she asks all of these questions, she is certain he would not give his answer.\nMonica could not see the expression on Duke Crockford's face since she had turned her back on him. However, she felt a stabbing pressure she had never felt before coming from behind.\nMonica suppressed her shaking legs and left the room. She saw the servant, who probably had put up the soundproof barrier earlier, standing outside the door, looking at Monica as if he were looking at something terrifying.\nEarlier when Monica took control of the barrier and destroyed it, she had not used any offensive magic. At a glance, it appeared more peaceful, but it was actually extremely more intimidating than it looks. After all, to take control of the barrier others had put up requires an overwhelming difference in ability.\nThis man must have realized how world apart their ability was.\nMonica paid no further attention to the man and walked down the corridor toward the Jade Room. The Jade Room is the place where only the king and the Seven Sages are allowed to enter… now that the other Seven Sages are attending the banquet, it becomes the perfect place for her to be alone.\nJust as she quietly climbed the stairs, she saw a human figure standing near the Jade Room.\nHe was Felix, a tall young man in formal attire. It was rare to see his hair a little disheveled. He must have run out of the banquet hall.\n\"I heard you were summoned by my grandfather, Lady Everett.\"\n\"………\"\n\"Did he say anything to you?\"\nNow she understands why Felix didn't know anything of what Duke Crockford had told to her. He is just a puppet. A beautiful puppet who merely acts according to Duke Crockford's bidding.\nYou even didn't know why he had killed my father… but why do you allow yourself to follow that person's bidding?\nSwallowing the words that were almost in her throat, Monica slipped past Felix and walked into the Jade Room.\n\"Lady Everett, did my grandfather make unreasonable demands on you?\"\nHe sounded desperate. He probably really cares about the Silent Witch. Even so, she was afraid of him because she didn't know what he thinks or desires.\nMonica unlocked the door of the Jade Room with the key in her trembling hand and stepped into the room. She then closed the door while hearing Felix's desperate voice behind her.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nFelix stood still as he was listening to the sound of the door slamming shut.\n\"Your Highness…\"\nHe heard a subdued voice. It was Will disguised as a lizard in his pocket. In response, he lightly pressed his hand over his pocket, gesturing that he could hear his voice.\n\"I guess we should speed up our plans a little bit.\"\nHe had been aware Duke Crockford had pulled many strings to ensure Felix will be enthroned as king. Felix was able to overlook it since he still can be of use to him… but it was different if he dare to mess with the Silent Witch.\nTo Felix, the Silent Witch is his idol, his hero. Totally different compared to himself, who is a false hero.\nOnce all the groundwork to crown myself is complete, I will ask that crook ruler to leave the kingdom.\nThanks to Madame Cassandra, he had all the information he needs. He has also made the necessary arrangements to restrain the Jeweled Magician who sided with Duke Crockford.\nAll that was left to do was to stick the blade to that man's neck like plucking a chess piece from the board and tell him a checkmate.\nIt would be a laughing matter if the newly enthroned king turns out to be a puppet king.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nMary Harvey the Star Oracle Witch, after changing her robe into a dress, went back to the banquet hall and saw Bradford Firestone the Artillery Magician, drunkenly holding a barrel of wine.\nBeside the red-faced snoring Bradford was Louis Miller the Barrier Magician, elegantly sipping a glass of wine with a sober expression.\n\"My, it's the same scene as the last year.\"\nMary approached him, causing the hem of her thin silk sways in her walk, and Louis parted his lips from the glass and smiled charmingly. There was no trace of drunkness appearing on his face.\n\"Would you like a glass? This year's red wines are particularly good.\"\n\"Sure. But I'm just curious, how many bottles did you empty?\"\n\"I wonder. I haven't counted it.\"\nIn contrast to Louis' appearance, he's quite a heavy drinker to be able to treat wine like juices.\nMary tipped her glass and took a sip, savoring the lingering taste as she watched the guests.\nEmanuel Darwin the Jeweled Magician was busy currying favor with the nobles of the second prince's faction. He owned several workshops and had many apprentices to manufacture and sells magical tools. He probably wants to expand his sales channels.\nA little further away by the wall, Ray Albright the Abyss Shaman was spreading his depressing air, and Raul Roseburg the Thorn Witch, who was stuck with him, was talking all sorts of things with a plate of food in his hand.\n\"Oh, Monica's not here?\"\n\"She's leaving not long ago like in a hurry.\"\nMary stared at Louis, looking for an answer.\nLouis parted his lips off the glass with ‘what?' and looked back at Mary half-heartedly.\n\"Lil Louis…how much do you know?\"\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\"The talk about the king's well-being.\"\nLouis sloshed wine into his empty glass and answered half-heartedly.\n\"I only know the physician was unable to help.\"\n\"Reaaallly~?\"\nThe hem of her dress swayed as Mary drew closer to Louis and she looked straight into the grayish-purple eyes behind his single pair of glasses.\n\"Tell me, Lil Louis… who do you think will become the king?\"\n\"Do you really want to start that sensitive topic here?\"\n\"I don't think anyone here has conscious to listen. Besides, I'm certain they are thinking the same thing.\"\nThis new year's ceremony becomes a place to test the water before choosing the next king.\nThe domestic nobles, especially the neutral ones, were carefully observing how the prince will act in the absence of the king.\nIn Mary's opinion, both the ceremony the first prince presided over and the banquet the second prince supervised are more than adequate.\nThey had put consideration of the king's condition and were able to maintain both events to preserve its lively atmosphere but not diminish the prestige of the kingdom. Both are impeccable in their consideration for the people while preserving their honor in front of the envoys of other countries.\nNow it is up to the first and second prince factions to how well they can attract the neutrals faction's interest at this banquet.\n\"I can see the neutral nobles are more in favor of the second prince's faction, overwhelming so if I would say. After all, the third prince's mother, Queen Phyllis, has sided with Duke Crockford.\"\nThe second prince's faction gained some momentum after the third prince's faction joined their cause. Moreover, the second prince Felix played an active role in the recent cursed dragon incident in Reinberg. Now, people were praising him as a hero.\nThe neutral nobles were leaning toward the second prince's faction one after another.\nLooking at how Mary wanted to figure out anything in his expression, Louis snorted.\n\"In the first place, it is already nonsense for us, the Seven Sages, who are direct subordinates of His Majesty, to claim to be of the first or second prince's faction.\"\n\"Oh my, I recall you are supporting the first prince.\"\n\"Just because I don't like the second prince and Duke Crockford, that doesn't mean I'm supporting the first prince.\"\nLouis shrugged his shoulders and continued his words dramatically.\n\"We only serve His Majesty alone. Therefore, everything is decided by the king's will.\"\n\"Lil Louis, your smile always shines brighter when you say things you don't really mean.\"\n\"Hahaha, that's harsh.\"\nLouis said with a radiant smile and looked around the hall.\nAt this banquet, everyone puts on a face merrily enjoying a drink, but behind their masks, they were probing each other. Their heads were probably full of thoughts about who will become the next king. In such a scene, Louis's grayish-purple eyes were sparkling enigmatically behind his single pair of glasses.\n\"Look at them, they were thinking they are the ones who were moving their chess pieces, but… well, now I'm wondering who is the one who's actually looking down at the pieces from the board.\"",

      "content": "Raul Roseburg's ancestor, the first Thorn Witch, was such a famous and great magician that no one in the kingdom who does not know her. She was an extraordinary genius who not only can manipulate plants at will, but also developed numerous magic formulas, and even was able to use the Black Flame, which is forbidden these days, to slaughter many dragons back then.\nBut she was not just an ordinary hero. It was said that her outrageous behavior made her existence become a legend.\nShe used anyone she didn't like as a test subject for her sorcery and made roses suck the living blood of young men. Rumors are saying she made anyone she didn't like become her test subject for sorcery or that she cultivated roses on the young men to suck their blood. There are no definite proofs, but one thing that can be testimonies is the king at that time was at her mercy.\nBecause her beauty was so out of this world, not only the king, even all the men of the kingdom were smitten by her charm.\nA legendary witch with immense mana and matchless beauty who ruled the kingdom. That is Raul's ancestor.\nBorn with the beauty and magic inherited from his ancestor, Raul has been carefully raised as the heir to the Roseburg family ever since he can remember.\nRaul often heard the adults in the Roseburg family believe he is the reborn of his first ancestor and told him a story of how outstanding the first Thorn Witch was. However, he was still unable to believe what they say.\nEven when the Roseburgs all praise the Thorn Witch, all the children in the city say otherwise.\nIn fact, when he actually read his ancestor's biography, it turned out the children of the city were right all along.\nSince Raul wanted to have some friends, he often went to chat with other kids in the city during his break training session. But no one wants to become his friend.\nThey never invite him to play because he was the descendant of a scary witch. Therefore, he tried another way to make friends and hid his identity. Unfortunately, his appearance was too conspicuous to hide.\nHe has the same rosy wavy hair, jade green eyes, and outstandingly beautiful face as the first Thorn Witch spoken of in the legend. The Roseburgs praised his appearance highly, but to the people in the city, the boy was too beautiful to be anything but an anomaly.\nApart from the Roseburgs, the only person who took care of Raul was Mary Harvey the Star Oracle Witch.\nAll of them are talking about my ancestor too much.\nSo the young Raul tried to rake his brain.\nHe even introduced himself as the descendant of the Toilet Witch in order to change their impression of his ancestor. Even so, people's perception of him remains unchanged.\nThe adults of Roseburg told him to practice offensive magic, but he ignored them all. If he had mastered offensive magic while possessing that much mana, it would only make people more afraid of him instead.\nInstead, it was better to use his abundance of mana to create a large flower garden or farm. If he grows lots of beautiful flowers and delicious vegetables and gives them to those in need, he was sure the impression of the Thorn Witch will change.\nWith this in mind, Raul worked diligently to cultivate the field. And like that, he gave his self-grown vegetables to people he met.\nEven then, no one wants to become Raul's friend. They kept avoiding Raul just because he was the descendant of the scary witch.\nAfter passing his sixteenth birthday, Raul took on the name of the fifth Thorn Witch and became the Seven Sages. People praise him highly for being the youngest Seven Sages, even then no one wanted to become his friend.\nIf in the end, he will take over that name, at least he wanted to change the name of the Thorn Witch to the Thorn Magician, but even such a trivial request would not be granted by his family. They said that name is very special in the Roseburg family, it could be said it was their identity. Therefore, they would not allow that identity to die out.\nRaul, who thus became the Seven Sages of Thorn Witch, just found out that there was a man relatively close in age to him among the Seven Sages.\nHe was eighteen years old at the time, and his name was Ray Albright the Abyss Shaman.\nSomeone from the Albright family, which is as prestigious as the Roseburg family, might be able to understand his difficulties. They might be able to get along.\nWith these expectations in mind, Raul spoke to Ray.\n\"Hey, I'm Raul Roseburg the fifth Thorn Witch! Nice to meet you!\"\nAt Raul's request for a handshake with a sparkle in his eye, Ray said something with a face like the end of the world.\n\"Curse the man with the pretty face…\"\nRaul pretended not to have heard that offending remark and offered his prized vegetables.\n\"Wanna have a vegetable?\"\n\"…No, thanks… Ugh, with that face of yours and a healthy body that tempered under the sun, such an incompatible combination… aargh, my eyes are… my eyes are burning…\"\nSince then, Raul has hardly spoken to Ray.\nIn the first place, Ray was a frequent absentee at the Seven Sages' meeting, so they didn't even have much of a chance to see each other.\nA year later, two seats of the Seven Sages were replaced.\nThe new members were Louis Miller the Barrier Magician and Monica Everett the Silent Witch.\nThe Silent Witch, in particular, was 15 years old, two years younger than Raul. She was the talk of the city because she had broken Raul's record of being the youngest Seven Sages he set a year earlier.\nIf it were the genius Silent Witch, he might be able to befriend her without being afraid of himself.\nSo Raul approached Monica with great enthusiasm on the day when she and Louis participated in the meeting of the Seven Sages for the first time.\n\"Heya there, I'm Raul Roseburg the Thorn Witch! Since we're the only youngster here, we should be friends with each other! Nice to meet you!\"\n\"………\"\n\"That's right, as a token of our friendship, I'll give you this vegetable. Here.\"\nMonica let out a strange exclamation and rolled back her eyes white when Raul offered her a carrot.\nHe later learned that the Silent Witch was an extremely shy person and could not speak properly with new acquaintances. Come to think of it, she also had hyperventilation and collapsed during the interview for the selection of the Seven Sages.\nIn the end, Raul didn't have many opportunities to have a conversation with Monica after that.\nMonica, who had social withdrawal, spent most of her time in a mountain cabin all year around and rarely showed up in the meeting of Seven Sages.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nIn the banquet hall of the new year's ceremony, Raul filled his plate with the dishes and approached Ray, who was huddled against the wall.\n\"Hey, Ray. Have you eaten yet? This meat sauce is really good. I think it would go well with my vegetables. If I'd know this, I would have brought carrots in my pocket.\"\n\"…where that confidence comes to have a nerve bringing his own vegetables to the banquet would not be scolded, if only I have that much confidence… I wish all the confident good-looking men are extinct…\"\n\"Oh, come to think of it, I saw Monica's hand radiating some kind of light. It was your doing, wasn't it?\"\n\"…now he didn't even listen to what people say… this is why I don't like people who think of themselves as the center of the world…\"\n\"Hey, tell me, how did you do that?\"\nRaul's jade-green eyes sparkled like a curious child.\nRay clicked his tongue and answered in a tired voice.\n\"…I only put a curse to light some part of her body.\"\n\"Wow, that's cool! Hey, let's try it on me. If possible make it my whole body shines! It sounds useful for tending the garden at night!\"\n\"I hope the bugs flocks on you…\"\nRay stared still at Raul with his gloomy eyes and mumbled bitterly again. But Raul didn't pay to his ranting and stuffed his mouth with the dishes from his plates.\nThere may nothing favorable coming from Ray's mouth, but even so, he feels no fear toward the Thorn Witch. Monica is the same. Neither of them is afraid of Raul.\nYup, I guess this kind of relationship is also a friendship.\nRaul nodded in convinced and began to think about what activity he should do with his friends next.\nPerhaps he should go with the current trend of inviting friends to his house at least once. Since there is a magnificence in the Roseburg family, it would be better if he shows them around his prized garden. Although half of it has recently been transformed into vegetable farms because of his hobby.\nHe wants them to eat his prized vegetables. Especially since his cabbages are growing really well this year.\n\"I decided, we should do harvesting cabbages together next time! I'll teach you how to be good at harvesting!\"\nDamn, I've had enough with him, Ray muttered with a dying look on his face, but it didn't reach Raul's ears who was now explaining how to harvest the cabbage.",

      "content": "There was a traveler at Wogan Mountain. He was a man around 30 years old in his common appearance and common travel outfit that leave not that much impression. Now such a traveler was admiring the mountain scenery as he approached a farmer working in the fields nearby.\n\"You sure working hard in this cold weather.\"\n\"It is! There are frequent dragon destructions around here. So I've got to work hard when they are laying low in the winter.\"\n\"Is that mountain the rumored Wogan Mountain where the Black Dragon appeared?\"\n\"Oh, it was different. There was no Black Dragon but many wyverns covering the sky which coming out so suddenly. It was a frightening sight.\"\nAs the farmer recounted the incident with gestures, the other farmers, who were eagerly looking for someone to tell the story, began to gather around and join in the conversation.\n\"Oh, mister. Are you looking for some scales too?\"\nBack in Kerbeck County, a dragon called the Black Dragon Wogan appeared around early summer. And such a black dragon was driven away by the Silent Witch of the Seven Sages. After that event, many people visited Wogan Mountains to collect the scales that remain there.\nThese dragon scales are very important material for creating amulets and magical tools and can be sold for a high price as much as jewelry.\n\"Well, yeah, it's just as you say.\"\n\"Sigh, I've seen many travelers like you who came here looking for the Black Dragon Wogan's scale ever since its disappearance.\"\n\"Unfortunately, you would not find any scales remaining if you go there now. The hunters picked them all up in the summer.\"\n\"Right, right. You'd better stop your attempt to climb the mountain. Perhaps there ain't no dragons that would do any harm but avalanches and boars are more dangerous.\"\n\"It's a shame I can't go there, but thanks for the reminder. Oh, right, do you know any good lodging around here? I haven't picked out a place to stay tonight.\"\nWhen the traveler said this, the farmers gave him their recommendations gladly.\n\"If you're looking for a place to stay, you should go for the Silver Spoon Pavilion. Their salted meat and bean soup are the best.\"\n\"Go to Grandma Tinder's bar if you want to drink, they have many choices of boozes. You just have to look for the rooster sign.\"\n\"Well, if you can sing or do any magic tricks, I recommend you to visit the lord's mansion. Since he likes that kind of performance, perhaps he'll let you stay in his place.\"\n\"Right, right. I heard Young Lady Isabelle is especially fond of plays and stories of legend. She also will pay you generously for any rare books you have.\"\nAfter the farmers mentioned their recommended place, the traveler laughed slightly in his mind.\n\"Well… I have a little confidence in my singing… Perhaps I'd go with that. Speaking of the lord, what kind of person is he?\"\n\"Our Count Kerbeck is presiding over this area. It's also because of his efforts, we are able to eat soup with salted meat this winter.\"\n\"Right, right. He even put low taxes since many dragons are nested around here.\"\nWhen talking about their lord they were speaking so energetically, that alone showed how much the lord of this area were loved by their people.\nHe is just like his investigation described him, the lord of this land, Azure Norton, Count Kerbeck, is a man who is loved by his people.\nThe farmers were praising high their lord… but one of them scurried ahead and said in a hushed voice.\n\"…mister, if you're going to visit the lord, don't ever go near the stables.\"\n\"…? Is there something in the stable?\"\nWhen the traveler gave them a curious look, the farmers all shut their mouths.\nEventually, the oldest man began to speak.\n\"Some years ago, the deceased wife of the previous lord took in a daughter from a convent. While she was alive, she was taken care of reasonably well, but after she passed away, she was very badly treated… especially by Young Lady Isabelle. I heard the said daughter was currently living in the stable because she was not allowed to live in the house.\"\nThis is it! The traveler muttered to himself. Apparently, the girl in question is a rumor among the locals.\nNow I can assume he had fabricated his images… No, I must verify it directly with my own eyes.\nAs the traveler made some arrangements for his plans, he put a sympathetic expression on his face.\n\"What a poor girl…\"\n\"Our lord is a good person, but only to that girl would he show his cold shoulder… Just remember this, if you go to the lord's mansion, make sure not to talk about that girl.\"\n\"Okay, I'll keep that in mind.\"\nThe traveler then struck up a brief conversation with the farmers, thanked them politely, and headed for the lord's mansion.\nAfter the traveler man left, the farmers stood remained there before continuing with their conversation. But they were not talking about ordinary talks like how well the crops grow or the grievance because of their wives.\n\"…he's gone?\"\n\"Hm, sure he is.\"\nThe farmers said in a hushed voice, and after making sure the traveler was small enough to be seen, they began planning to perform their respective duties.\n\"Alright guys, the operation has begun. I'll go to the lord's place on horseback. You contact the old man at the Silver Spoon Pavilion and have him stall the traveler.\"\n\"Okay, that old man's sure got a long story to tell. He's the best person to keep him busy.\"\n\"Right, right. I'll get going shortly.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nIt was long past noon when the traveler arrived at the lord's mansion.\nHe had actually planned to arrive a little earlier, but he ended up spending all of his time getting caught up with an old man who loved telling stories and having dried vegetables given to him by an old lady who was passing by.\nNow then, I could enter the mansion through the front door like a traveler who sells his magic tricks… but I should pay a visit to the girl in question in person.\nStables are usually located at the back of the house, so he went there by walking around to avoid being seen by the guard.\nHalfway through the trip, he found a spot with a loose fence, so he entered through it and hid in the shadows as he headed for the stables.\nAnd then, mingled with the horses' neighing, he heard some high-pitched laughter.\n\"Ohohohoho!\"\nWhile wondering what was going on, the man arrived at the stable and sneaked a peek inside through the small window.\nThere were two girls in the stable. One was a girl with curly orange hair in a beautiful dress. This girl was probably the daughter of the mansion's master. The high-pitched laugh he heard earlier seemed to be hers.\nThat's Young Lady Isabelle, Count Kerbeck's daughter… which means that the other one is…\nA girl with light brown hair, cowering and sobbing in front of Isabelle. He could not clearly see her face because she was hanging down her head, but he could tell her clothes were shabby, and her hands, peeking out from her worn-out sleeves were red and sore.\nThe light brown-haired girl pleaded with Isabelle in a feeble voice.\n\"I beg you, Young Lady Isabelle… Please… Please give me something… to eat…\"\n\"You should be aware that your existence is less than livestock in this stable since the horses are more useful than you, and yet you want to eat? You should have known your standing better! Dear me, I wonder why my grandmother took in a girl like you!\"\n\"Please… I beg you…\"\nWhen the light brown-haired girl pleaded pitifully, Isabelle's eyes narrowed and a very nasty smile crept onto her lips.\n\"Ah, sure. I'll at least give you some water.\"\nAfter saying those words, Isabelle picked up a bucket of water for the horses to drink… and splashed it in front of the poor girl. Not only did the cold midwinter water soak the hem of the girl's dress, but it also leave some stain on her skirt. Even the shabby-dressed girl was dumbfounded when seeing her skirt soaked with water.\nTo a such girl, Isabelle smirked and said.\n\"Here, you can crawl over and drink as much as you like.\"\n\"………\"\nJust as the light brown-haired girl, shivering full, hung her head to place her mouth in the puddle of water in front of her, a man entered the stable. The elderly man, clad in a fine woolen cloak, was Count Kerbeck, the master of the house.\n\"Oh, Isabelle. What are you doing here?\"\nWhen Count Kerbeck asked while fiddling with his mustache, Isabelle instantly made a sad face and hugged her father with tears in her eyes.\n\"Father, please listen to me. This girl tried to pour water on me!\"\nThe light brown-haired girl looked up in surprise and tried to say ‘no, it's not like that…' to stand up for herself. However, Count Kerbeck paid no heed to the voice of the miserable girl.\n\"You really have no shame! Have you forgotten the kindness my family has done to you?\"\nThe poor girl was trembling as she fell flat on her face at Count Kerbeck's angry voice as if it echoed from the bottom of his stomach. She did not care that her clothes were getting even dirtier.\nLooks like the rumor of Monica Norton is the disgrace of Count Kerbect seemed to be true.\nWhen the traveler, who was observing their exchange, noticed a young horseman approaching from the house, he quickly left the stable and turned back the way he had come.\nRather than pretending to be a traveler and then staying at Count Kolbeck's mansion, it would be better now to return to his master as soon as possible and tell him of the scene he had witnessed.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nOnce a young horseman wearing the newsboy cap entered the stable, he approached out Count Kerbeck.\n\"Looks like he's gone already.\"\nAt the horseman's words, Count Kerbeck simply gave a ‘hm' response as he nodded, and approached the light brown-haired girl who was crawling on the ground.\n\"Good work, Agatha.\"\n\"Thank you for your kind words.\"\nThe light brown-haired girl raised her head and removed the wig from her head.\nAgatha, running her hands through her slightly disheveled dark brown hair, is Isabelle's personal maid.\nCount Kerbeck, in order to assist Monica Everett the Silent Witch with her current mission, has taken on the role of a father who abused his adopted daughter.\nHowever, a suspicious person appeared at several convents in his territory a few days ago and went around looking for a girl named Monica.\nMonica Norton was a girl of the deceased wife of the previous Count Kerbeck adopted from a convent or so how her background was described. Perhaps because the existence of the girl called Monica Norton had aroused someone's suspicion, he was sent here to sniff around the Count Kerbeck family.\nSo Count Kerbeck instructed residents around the house to direct any suspicious travelers to his mansion, and together with Isabelle and Agatha, they put on a show to make them think that a girl named Monica Norton really exists in this mansion.\n\"Should I follow him?\"\nAlan, Agatha twin's brother and also the horseman wearing a newsboy cap suggested this to Count Kerbeck.\nAt Alan's words, Count Kerbeck thought for a moment before shaking his head.\n\"No, it's fine. I would really like to know his master's identity, however, if his master finds out that we have been probing him, our current performance will have been for naught.\"\nInstead, it's better he kept oblivious to the spy's presence and continued his performance to show that Monica Norton is a member of the Count Kerbeck family.\nTo achieve this, the Kolbeck family must…\n\"Now I must refine my acting more for when the same spy comes to me in the future!\"\nAlan fell silent with an indescribable look on his face.\nMeanwhile, Isabelle and Agatha were nodding their heads rapidly with a sparkle in their eyes.\n\"Father's right. I'd better have polished my villainous more in the future! I have to work hard!\"\n\"Incidentally, Master, is that perhaps you grew your beard… for this very purpose?\"\nCount Kerbeck, fiddling with his prided mustache, panicked a little when hearing Agatha's words.\n\"Hm, I figured something like this might happen.\"\nAlan wondered ‘what kind of a thing is something like this?', but he did not say it out loud.\n\"As expected of Father! You really do understand the way of villainous! If we are talking about the evil Count, a mustache is a must!\"\nAlan thought ‘aren't there plenty of counts who have moustaches?', but he still didn't say it out loud.\nThe Norton father, his daughter, and the maid Agatha seemed to be having a lot of fun discussing what a villain should be like and how they should be more particular about their costumes next time.\nAlan interrupted the three of them modestly.\n\"Master Norton, Young Lady Isablelle, I think you should continue your discussion inside the manor since it's getting colder around here…\"\n\"Oh, I forgot we're still here. I'm sorry.\"\n\"Agatha, you must have felt cold. I've warmed a bath for you, so go wash yourself up.\"\n\"Uhuhu, thank you for your concern, My Lady.\"\nCount Kerbeck is indeed a good lord who cares for his subjects. And his daughter Isabelle also has the kindness to care for her servants.\nIt's just that this father and daughter are a bit… too… high spirit.\nCount Kerbeck, in particular, is the kind of playful person who jumps into the village festival stage without a second thought.\nAlan smiled wryly in secret.\nThough, that's exactly the reason why the people love him so much.\nIt was also thanks to Count Kerbeck's reputation that his subjects were willing to cooperate with his instructions to stall any suspicious travelers and report them to the lord's residence.\nAlan also shared the same fondness for the Kerbeck family.\nSometimes, though, he thinks they can be quite exasperating.",

      "content": "Glenn Dudley was just an ordinary boy that could be found anywhere.\nHis family consisted of his parents and two younger sisters. He had a bright and cheerful personality and many friends.\nThough he struggled a bit with arithmetic and often made mistakes giving change while working at the store, Glenn's natural charm endeared him to the adults in town.\nHe had always thought that someday he would marry a smart wife who could count money correctly and take over the family butcher shop, but Glenn's life took a drastic turn on his twelfth birthday. Suddenly, ministers and officials, or some kind of important-looking adults, showed up at Glenn's house and made this proclamation:\n\"The Star Oracle Witch of the Seven Sages has foretold that if Glenn Dudley inherits the Dudley Butcher Shop, this country will be doomed.\"\nTo be honest, Glenn's initial reaction was something along the lines of \"What on earth is this?\" At first, he thought it might be some kind of joke, but after listening to the story, it seemed to be a serious matter.\nEven Glenn, who wasn't particularly good at academics, knew the name of the \"Star Oracle Witch.\" She was the most renowned prophetess in the kingdom of Ridill.\nAfterward, Glenn was taken to the castle, and his magical power was measured, which astonished the adults around him. His magical power far exceeded the average of an advanced magician.\nThough he had never learned magic and had hardly seen it in action before, Glenn was astonished but also excited.\nIt seemed he had some incredible hidden power within him. It felt somewhat like being the protagonist of a story.\nFollowing this, Glenn enrolled in Minerva, the most prestigious institution for magician training with the expensive tuition fully covered by the kingdom.\nHis family was overjoyed at his remarkable success, and Glenn was proud. He imagined himself learning powerful magic at Minerva and eventually becoming a hero like Ralph to save the kingdom from crisis.\nWell, he couldn't quite imagine what kind of crisis the kingdom would face.\nHowever, contrary to his expectations, life at Minerva wasn't enjoyable.\nMost of the students at Minerva were from noble families, which meant that the difficulty level of the basic subjects was much higher than that of ordinary schools.\nGlenn struggled in magical classes, and he barely passed his basic courses. His classmates openly looked down on him.\n\"Why is a guy like him even at Minerva if he's not noble? He's just an idiot with a lot of mana…\"\nIt frustrated him so much that he wanted to prove himself to those who looked down on him. So even though it had just three months of enrolling, he began practicing practical magic.\nAt Minerva, practical training didn't start until six months into enrollment. But driven by the determination typical of boys his age, Glenn secretly started practicing combat magic.\nThough he struggled with the magical formulas taught in class, he excelled at manipulating mana.\nConcentrating his internal mana into his palms, he could change its form like molding clay. By incorporating half-remembered magical formulas and adding attributes and directions, magic could be cast surprisingly easily.\nHis first successful attempt was with fire magic. The fireball Glenn conjured was about as big as two adults holding their hands in a circle.\nIt was rare for a student at Minerva to create such a large fireball.\nThrilled, Glenn practiced shooting fireballs repeatedly.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nOne day, while Glenn was engaged in his usual secret training, a male student approached him while humming a tune.\n\"Hmm hmm. Hey there, newbie. That's some impressive power you've got there.\"\nIt seemed this male student had been secretly observing Glenn's training. He was grinning joyfully as he looked at the scorched rocks from the fireball.\nThis male student was tall and slim, and his fiery red hair left a huge impression on him. While Glenn was relatively tall for his age, this student was about a head taller than him. Presumably, he was a bit older than Glenn.\n\"Hey, have you ever done magical combat? Using magic inside a barrier to fight.\"\n\"I've heard of it, but never actually done it.\"\nAfter all, Glenn hadn't even started practical classes yet. So he practiced secretly.\nThe male student rested his hand on his pointed chin and grinned as he made a proposition to Glenn.\n\"Well then, how about we give it a shot? Magical combat. Inside a barrier, you won't have to worry about getting hurt, and you can have practical combat training safely, you know?\"\n\"But, I'm not supposed to do practical training yet…\"\n\"No problem at all. Just use the training grounds secretly at night. I can activate a simple combat barrier myself.\"\nNaturally, it would result in severe consequences if the teachers found out. However, the idea of secret midnight training tickled Glenn's youthful heart.\nWith a mixture of excitement and reluctance, as he tried to convince himself otherwise, Glenn found the male student narrowing his eyes and raising the corners of his mouth in a mischievous grin.\n\"Your magic is incredible. I've never seen a newcomer conjure such a massive fireball.\"\n\"Well, hehe, I, I guess so…\"\n\"Yeah, if you get some combat training, you'll improve even more, you know?\"\nGlenn's lips twitched unconsciously.\nEver since he joined Minerva, he had been branded as an underachiever, starving for compliments all along.\nSo, he accidentally succumbed to the male student's temptation. He nodded.\n\"I want to try combat training!\"\n\"Sure thing! I'll give you a workout, newbie.\"\nLittle did he know, that upperclassman of him would turn out to be the worst troublemaker in all of Minerva.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nIn the middle of the night, Glenn desperately fled through the forest.\nThere was no time to wipe the sweat from his cheeks, only a harsh breath punctuated by stifled screams and sobs in between.\nHow had things ended up like this?\nAs Glenn repeated this internal dialogue, a burst of flame erupted behind him.\n\"Ah!\"\nInstinctively rolling on the ground to evade, a rain of fiery arrows came down on the spot he had just vacated.\nHe couldn't avoid them all, and a few of the arrows pierced his arm.\nThe searing pain of flesh being torn. But in reality, there were no burns on his arm. Not only that, but his clothes weren't even singed.\nInside the simplified combat barrier, attacks driven by magic wouldn't cause physical damage. However, the pain was real, and for each hit, his mana decreased.\nWhat is this? What is this? What is this?!\nGlenn tried to cast a spell to retaliate, but fear had numbed his mind, rendering the incantation impossible to recall. He was so panicked that he could mess up even simple arithmetic. Let alone complex magical formulas were far from his thoughts.\n\"Hmm, hmm hmm? Hey, hey, hey, don't stop running, okay? If your prey doesn't run desperately, the hunt won't be any fun, you know?\"\nThe upperclassman who had lured Glenn into this magical combat grinned mischievously, approaching leisurely as if to demonstrate his superiority. And so, he conjured flaming arrows using shortened incantations and attacked Glenn.\nCrawling on the ground in a sorry state, Glenn desperately evaded while flames pierced his legs, causing him to writhe in agony.\nThough there were no physical wounds, the sensation of skin being torn and the intense pain of burnt flesh were perfectly replicated. He felt like he was going mad.\nMana dwindled with each hit. He wished his mana would deplete quickly. If that happened, he would be freed from this torment.\nHowever, Glenn, who had extraordinary mana capacity more than most people, still had plenty of mana left.\n\"I can't take it anymore! …I can't, I can't do this…\"\nAs Glenn cried out, the upperclassman frowned as if his enthusiasm had waned.\n\"Don't tell me you're giving up already? Hm? You still have plenty of mana left, don't you? Come on, come on, try shooting me once.\"\nWith those words, the upperclassman spread his long, slender arms wide, inviting Glenn to attack freely.\nWith a mix of fear and anger swirling within him, Glenn focused his mana.\nHe couldn't bear this pain any longer. If that was the case, then everything, everything, everything, everything should just disappear.\nAs he channeled his mana into a haphazard magical formula, he felt something snap in his mind. At the same time, everything went white before his eyes.\n\"Ah…\"\nThe absentminded voice of the upperclassman reached Glenn's ears just as he completely lost consciousness.\nUnaware of the consequences his massive surge of mana had brought about.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nWhen Glenn regained consciousness next, he found himself in the disciplinary room.\nThe magical rampage Glenn had unleashed had not only shattered the simplified combat barrier but also damaged a part of the school building adjacent to the training area.\nFortunately, it was the dead of night, so there were no people inside the building, and there were no casualties. However, it's needless to say that had things gone slightly differently, it could have led to a major accident.\nTaking the situation seriously, the professors at Minerva restrained Glenn and held discussions regarding the incident.\nGlenn Dudley was a child who had received a prophecy from the Star Oracle Witch. If this boy inheriting the family were to bring about the nation's downfall, they couldn't leave it unattended.\nHowever, if this problematic child couldn't be handled even at Minerva, a prestigious institution for training magicians, wouldn't it be better to confine him for life?\nAnd so, as weeks passed with Glenn confined to the disciplinary room, a magician came forward expressing interest in taking custody of Glenn.\nThe magician's name was Louis Miller, the Barrier Magician.\nDespite his young age, this man served as the commander of the Ridill Kingdom's Magical Corps. He appeared before Glenn, who was feeling downcast and dispirited, and smiled elegantly and beautifully as he said:\n\"Well done! You've certainly given those old fogies at Minerva a shock. Let me give you some praise.\"\nIt took about ten seconds for Glenn to comprehend what had just been said.\n\"Uh, um… I mean… huh?\"\nAt that moment, Glenn realized that it had been a while since he'd had a conversation with someone, and he was starting to forget how to speak.\nSeeing Glenn's mouth opening and closing, Louis cheerfully spoke up.\n\"To think you'd destroy that old-fashioned school building! It's absolutely exhilarating that you accomplished something I couldn't even manage during my time there. And to top it off, the room blown away was Professor Rutherford's study… Serve you right, damn old coos! Poking at people's pasts like that… All the evidence went up in smoke, so they won't be able to act so smugly anymore…\"\nLouis's once elegant upper-class tone gradually crumbled, interspersed with more ominous words. Moreover, an evil grin seemed to play across his beautiful face.\nDumbfounded, Glenn asked, \"Um, uh… So, who are you?\"\n\"I am Louis Miller, the commander of the Magic Corps and known as the Barrier Magician. Starting today, I'll be your mentor.\"\nAs Louis lifted his monocle lightly and bent over, he peered into Glenn's face.\nMystical eyes tinged with a purplish-gray color, framed by long lashes, reflected Glenn.\nBeing scrutinized so closely by a handsome man, despite Glenn's throbbing heart, Louis declared:\n\"I see, you have the look of someone not quite bright.\"\nGlenn thought, \"Isn't this person a bit too rude?\"\nHowever, Louis paid no mind to Glenn's vexed expression.\n\"Considering you've probably been using magic with only your instincts and not really grasping magical formulas, someone like you doesn't fit Minerva's educational approach. I'll make sure to train you thoroughly to be useful in real combat situations.\"\n\"But… I… don't want to use magic anymore…\"\nMuttering because he was scared, Glenn was met by Louis extending two slender fingers right in front of his face.\n\"You have two choices. Spend your life in confinement or become my apprentice.\"\n\"That's so tyrannical!\"\nAs Glenn involuntarily exclaimed, Louis tilted his head in a refined manner.\n\"Tyrannical? Isn't having choices itself a form of happiness? Well, personally, I would choose a third option.\"\n\"…A third option?\"\n\"If you become my apprentice, I'll tell you.\"\nIt did sound somewhat like a scam. Nevertheless, the fact remained that Glenn didn't have any other options.\nWhen Glenn pursed his lips into a faint frown and softly said, \"I'll become your apprentice,\" Louis responded with a cheerful smile.\n\"Oh, how delightful! If I take in a problem child that Minerva can't handle, those old coots will lose their ground in front of me. They won't be able to act so pompous anymore.\"\nHe spoke boldly and freely. But for Glenn, there was no other path than to become this seemingly overbearing man's apprentice.\nWith a slightly sullen expression, Glenn asked with a hint of irritation, \"So, what's this ‘third option' you mentioned?\"\nIn response to Glenn's question, Louis smiled beautifully and elegantly, and said:\n\"It's obviously to ‘destroy a building on your own to escape,' isn't it?\"\nShortly after this incident, Monica enrolled at Minerva. She joined the school not long after Glenn, almost around the same time.",

      "content": "On the day before the end of the winter break at Serendia Academy, Monica arranged to meet with Isabelle at a town situated between the royal capital and Count Kerbeck's territory. They were on their way back to Serendia Academy.\nDuring the winter break, since Monica had accompanied Isabelle on her return home, they had to return to the dormitory together in the same carriage to avoid suspicion.\nAs Monica boarded the Kerbeck Count's carriage, Isabelle, who had boarded earlier, embraced Monica tightly.\n\"Big Sister Monica, I've been longing to see you! I heard that last month, you and Prince Felix together defeated the cursed dragon in Reinberg! As expected of Big Sister Monica… You're as amazing as ever! My spirits are soaring!\"\nAgatha, Isabelle's maid, chided the excited Isabelle with a calm tone.\n\"Excuse me, My Lady, the coachman can't bring out the carriage like this.\"\nReprimanded by Agatha, Isabelle blushed and took her seat. Nevertheless, since Isabelle was still holding onto Monica's arm, Monica naturally ended up sitting beside her.\nAs the carriage started moving slowly, Isabelle bombarded Monica with questions about the dragon-slaying incident. How big was the dragon, and how did they manage to defeat it?\nWhile Monica stumbled through the barrage of questions, Agatha interjected gently.\n\"My Lady, perhaps it's better to tell Miss Monica about the recent matter?\"\nIsabelle suddenly looked up and covered her mouth with her hand.\n\"You're right, that's true.\"\n\"…The recent matter?\"\n\"I have something important to report to you, Big Sister Monica.\"\nIsabelle straightened herself properly and proceeded to explain an incident that had occurred right after the winter break had started.\nApparently, there had been someone in the Kerbeck Count's territory asking around about the existence of a girl named Monica. This person had been inquiring at various places, including a monastery within the Kerbeck territory.\nMoreover, it seemed that this person had managed to sneak into the Kerbeck Count's mansion.\nHearing this, Monica turned pale.\nAs part of her cover to infiltrate Serendia Academy, Louis had devised a backstory for Monica Norton: \"She had been living in a monastery but was taken in by the former Countess of Kerbeck.\" And the fact that someone had specifically looked into the monastery meant that someone was doubting Monica's background.\n\"During the winter break, Agatha posed as you, Miss Monica. The townspeople are also cooperating with our story. I don't think anyone has caught on.\"\n\"Th-thank you…\"\nMonica expressed gratitude while feeling uneasy inside.\nIf someone was questioning the existence of Monica Norton, it was highly likely that the person was somehow connected to Serendia Academy.\nAnd the person with the highest likelihood, at this point, was…\n…Could it be Prince Felix?\nBack in the Reinberg Duchy, Felix had been convinced that the Silent Witch was someone from Serendia Academy. Therefore, investigating Monica's background as a potential candidate for the Silent Witch was entirely plausible.\nJudging by the reaction during the New Year's ceremony, I don't think my true identity has been exposed… I hope…\nIf the one inquiring about Monica Norton wasn't Felix, then Monica couldn't fathom who else it might be.\nAs if sensing an invisible enemy lurking behind her, Isabelle took something out of her baggage.\n\"In light of that… I've come up with a plan for after the winter break.\"\n\"….? A plan?\"\n\"Yes, here it is.\"\nIsabelle presented Monica with a diary.\nTaking it and flipping through the pages, Monica realized that the diary contained detailed accounts of Isabelle's experiences during the winter break. The noteworthy aspect was that the diary contained entries involving Monica herself.\n\"Today, I went on an inspection to Averon. But honestly, why must that woman accompany me on these visits? Instead of having her as an attendant, I made her carry my belongings, and she immediately started whining. So, I skipped her meal as punishment (continued).\"\n\"Oh, what a disaster! That woman, with her carelessness, managed to break my favorite cup. That new aqua-colored cup from Phalim May… I adored the delicate vine rose pattern! Naturally, there was no way I could forgive her, so I banished her to the stable. Having such a woman in the same estate is no joke! She's even worse off than livestock, that woman. Even the stable is too luxurious for her! (continued).\"\nSeeing Monica utterly speechless, Isabelle's eyes sparkled as she spoke.\n\"How do you like it?\"\nHow should Monica respond to that? For now, she decided to ask what she genuinely thought.\n\"Um, well… What is this?\"\n\"It's my winter holiday diary. A masterpiece I wrote with Agatha's input.\"\nThe diary, for all intents and purposes, was remarkably detailed in its descriptions. It covered everything from the interior of Count Kerbeck's estate to the colors and designs of Isabelle's dresses, and even the design and pattern of the (supposedly) broken cup Monica was responsible for. The level of detail in the descriptions was extraordinary.\nSeeing Monica's confusion, Isabelle spoke with a serious expression.\n\"After the winter break, discussions at tea parties usually revolve around what happened during the holidays. So, even if your friends ask you about your winter break experiences, having read this, you'll be perfectly prepared!\"\n\"I see…!\"\nMonica's actual winter holiday consisted of the dragon incident in Duke Reinberg's territory, going to her foster mother's house, and attending New Year's ceremonies and banquets at the royal palace. Naturally, she couldn't honestly divulge all of that. However, if she kept the contents of this diary in mind, she could smoothly handle winter break conversations without having to come up with excuses.\nBut… I wonder if I can really share this with anyone?\nMonica pondered this question as she mentally simulated the situation.\nFirst, Monica thought of Lana.\n\"What did you do over the winter break, Monica?\"\n\"I helped Lady Isabelle with her luggage, but I was made to skip meals.\"\nNext, Monica thought of Glenn.\n\"What kind of delicious meals did you have during the break, Monica?\"\n\"I was driven to the stables and had nothing but muddy water for meals.\"\nThis was still somewhat difficult to talk about with others… but dismissing Isabelle's goodwill was also something she couldn't bring herself to do. For the time being, Monica resolved to read through this diary, which was the thickness of a short story, by tomorrow morning.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThe attic, untouched for a long time, had gathered a bit of dust.\nMonica opened the window for some ventilation and pulled Nero out of her luggage bag. Nero seemed to still be in hibernation, occasionally waking up to drink a little water before immediately curling up to sleep again.\nMonica lined an empty basket with a warm cloth and gently placed Nero inside, whispering, \"Wake up soon.\"\nAbout to roll up her sleeves to start cleaning, Monica suddenly noticed a letter placed on the desk. It seemed that during the winter break, a letter had arrived for her and the dorm supervisor had delivered it to her room.\nCurious about the sender, Monica picked up the envelope and was surprised by the name written on it.\nBernie Jones.\nHe was a former schoolmate from her time at Minerva, now a boy who had become her rival.\nSetting aside her cleaning plans, Monica carefully opened the envelope with a paper-knife.\n\"To my eternal rival, how have you been?\nI, the capable one, have been diligently studying and touring my estate every day, preparing to become the next Earl.\nAlthough I would have liked to attend the New Year's ceremony as the next heir, I am unable to do so due to my brother's recent passing, which is regrettable.\nNow, despite my busy schedule, I have taken up the pen to provide you with useful information. As your lifetime rival, I thought it fitting to offer you assistance through this letter.\nThough you might want to sob in gratitude, once you lay your eyes upon the information I'm about to disclose, you might find yourself sobbing for an entirely different reason.\nAre you ready? Take a deep breath now, make sure not to scream, and read the second piece of paper.\"\nAs the letter instructed, Monica took a deep breath and covered her mouth with her hand, then unfolded the second sheet of paper.\n\"Are you mentally prepared? Very well, then I shall convey the message to you.\nOne of the most notorious troublemakers at Minerva, Senior Hubert Day, has recently been expelled from Minerva and is set to transfer to Serendia Academy this winter.\nYes, that's right. The same Hubert Day who ardently pursued you during your time at Minerva, continuously challenging you to magical battles, that eccentric combat enthusiast.\nSenior Day is likely unaware of your undercover status at Serendia Academy. Nevertheless, it's undeniable that if he were to find you, he would undoubtedly challenge you to a magical battle.\nPlease be sure to avoid being discovered by Senior Day and continue to fulfill your mission while keeping your shaking tendency day and night.\nYours truly, your lifelong rival, Barnie Jones.\"\nMonica didn't scream, but her breathing turned into a hoarse gasping as she covered her mouth with her hand. Her small frame trembled, and sweat beaded all over her body.\n\"Se-se-se, Senior Day is coming!?\"\nHubert Day was a senior during Monica's time at Minerva. He was known for being the nephew of one of the Seven Sages, the Altilery Magician, and was notorious for his aggressive and dangerous nature.\nComing from a prestigious family, Hubert had caused numerous violent incidents during his time at Minerva. Due to his behavior, he had repeated multiple years and was one of Minerva's top five infamous troublemakers.\nAbout a decade ago, there was a legendary problem child at Minerva known as the \"Minerva Delinquent.\" Although not as widely recognized, Hubert was said to rival this title and was referred to behind closed doors as the \"Second Minerva Delinquent.\"\nHubert had a penchant for magical battles conducted within special barriers and would challenge anyone—teachers, upperclassmen, it didn't matter. He had a fiery temperament similar to that of the Artillery Magician, but his inability to communicate effectively was where Hubert excelled. His overbearing behavior surpassed even that of Nero, and it was truly challenging to put into words.\nThree years ago, which Monica vividly remembered, she had found herself in a magical battle against Hubert. Overwhelmed by fear, as soon as the match began, she unleashed every attack spell she could muster without chanting… In simple terms, she had soundly beaten Hubert.\nSince then, Monica had been firmly on Hubert's radar, chased and challenged to magical battles whenever the opportunity arose.\nThe reason Monica had become more reclusive and spent more time in her study wasn't just due to her shyness; it was also to evade Hubert's relentless pursuit.\n\"Wh-wh-wh-what should I dooooo?\"\nEven if she used makeup or disguises, there was little chance of fooling Hubert. While he appeared rough and uncouth, he had an astonishingly sharp observational eye.\nOnce she entered his field of vision, she would inevitably be dragged to a magical battle arena, and he would challenge her without mercy.\nAs if the stress of potentially being discovered by Felix or someone else digging into her background wasn't enough, now this additional problem had arisen!\nClutching Barnie's letter tightly, Monica's sobs grew more intense.",

      "content": "On the first day of the new semester, Monica was more cautious than ever, constantly looking around as she made her way to her classroom.\nChecking to the right, checking to the left, checking ahead, checking behind… With each step, she appeared highly suspicious, glancing around nervously, which made her look like nothing less than a suspicious character to anyone who saw her.\n\"…What are you doing?\"\nMonica was caught off guard when Lana called out to her from behind, causing her to shudder and let out a strange, high-pitched sound, \"Eek!?\" It was a weird noise that resulted from suppressing the urge to scream out loud.\nIf she were to scream loudly in front of \"that person\"… there was no doubt he would notice. He would definitely notice. And then, \"that person\" would say…\n──Well, well, well, long time no see, huh? Everett?\nRemembering the fear she had experienced in the past, Monica shivered involuntarily. Lana leaned in, looking concerned, and peered into Monica's face.\n\"Hey, you look really pale. Maybe you should rest in the dorm?\"\n\"N-No, I'm f-f-fine. No classes t-today.\"\nThe first day of the new semester was only an easy orientation.\nThe young ladies from families with connections held tea parties after the orientation, busy bragging about their winter break and exchanging information. But that was a world that Monica had no connection to.\nThere's the student council meeting after the orientation… Can I act normal like always?\nThinking about the events from the winter break, a pain throbbed in her left arm. Although the bruises from the damage inflicted by the cursed dragon had healed beautifully, the pain still remained. Her grip strength hadn't recovered much either, so even lifting a teacup with her left hand was difficult.\n…I need to hide it properly.\nMonica thought back to the events during the winter break.\nWhen faced with the Silent Witch, Felix had shown deference and respect in his eyes.\nThe same with Cyril. He had acted with utmost courtesy toward the Seven Sages, the country's top figures.\nIt was only natural.\nIf Lana were to find out… Monica would probably never be able to interact with her as a friend like before.\n…I really don't want that.\nMonica clenched her left hand, which had almost no grip strength. Just slightly curling her fingers caused a sharp pang of pain from her fingertips to her wrist.\nShe had to hide it well. The pain in her left hand, her true identity, everything.\nThat's why I can't let \"that person\" find out…\nThinking about the senior who had once chased her, Monica's face twisted with bitterness. Just then, she heard a familiar voice from behind.\n\"Hey!\"\nTurning around, Glenn and Neil were walking towards them.\nWaving energetically at Monica and the others, Glenn, who was entirely bruise-free now, had a vibrant voice and was as lively as always.\n\"Morning!\"\n\"Good morning.\"\nThe four of them exchanged greetings and started chatting about their winter break as they headed to the classroom.\nNeil talked about how he had leisurely spent time at home, and Lana described her visit to the Southern Doll Port with her father.\n\"Southern Doll is amazing no matter how many times you visit. There are so many shops that it never gets boring. So, what about you two, Monica, and Glenn?\"\nFinally, the question came.\nRecalling the contents of Isabelle's diary, Monica pondered what she should say. However, Glenn beat her to it.\n\"I was helping my mentor with work during the first half of the winter break and went to Reinberg.\"\nLana's eyes widened in surprise.\n\"What!? You…you went to Reinberg!? Wasn't it the place where the cursed dragon incident happened?\"\nIt seemed that Lana wasn't aware that Glenn had been to Reinberg.\nThe cursed dragon incident in Reinberg had been a massive upheaval that shook the entire kingdom, but since the Second Prince and the Silent Witch were the ones who had defeated the dragon, their names had garnered all the attention.\nThere weren't many who knew that a disciple of the Barrier Magician had been present. Lana's surprise was understandable.\nAs Monica was lost in thought, Lana looked at her intently.\n\"…Monica, you don't seem that surprised. Did you maybe already know?\"\n\"Huh? N-No, I'm…I'm really surprised.\"\nMonica vigorously shook her head, almost looking like she might break her neck in the process.\nI can't tell her that I was actually there…!\nLuckily, Lana didn't press further about Monica's odd behavior and turned to Glenn instead.\n\"Hey, hey, so did you also fight the cursed dragon in Reinberg?\"\n\"Well, I…\"\nGlenn hesitated for a moment, his words faltering, and he lowered his gaze.\nMonica wondered what to say, fearing that the memory of the terror from that dragon might be causing him distress.\nSurely, only Monica knew at this moment that Glenn had been afflicted by the curse of the dragon and nearly died.\nBut before Monica could say anything, Glenn suddenly lifted his head and laughed.\n\"I didn't do anything. The ones who defeated the cursed dragon were the student council president and Lady Silent Witch!\"\n\"You didn't see His Highness and the others fight?\"\n\"Nah, I didn't really see much.\"\nNaturally. Glenn had been unconscious after being cursed on the hunting grounds.\nHowever, it seemed Glenn had no intention of sharing the fact that he had been cursed.\nI wonder if his health is okay…\nEven Monica, who had only suffered a slight bit of the curse from the dragon, still struggled with its aftereffects. Even though he has high resistance to magic, there was no way Glenn, who had been affected by the curse throughout his body, could be completely fine. Monica couldn't help but think that if she had handled things more skillfully, Glenn wouldn't have had to bear the curse.\nDuring the New Year's ceremony, Monica apologized to Louis. She had apologized for causing harm to his important disciple.\nLouis Miller's response had been refreshingly straightforward.\n\"I'm not foolish enough to blame someone else for my disciple's lack of skill.\"\nWhile Louis was the type to create debts whenever possible and then thoroughly collect them, he didn't reproach Monica about the cursed dragon incident.\nNonetheless, Monica couldn't help but think she could have done more to help Glenn. She couldn't shake off the feeling that she could have prevented Glenn from being cursed.\n\"Monica, what's wrong? You seem down. Are you feeling okay?\"\nMonica snapped out of her thoughts when Glenn looked down at her with concern. She managed to smile vaguely.\n\"N-Nothing…\"\n\"By the way, Monica, what did you do during the winter break? Did you have a meat pie for the winter solstice?\"\n\"No, I had crackers and pickles…\"\nShe began answering before realizing that her actual meal──because Hilda, her adoptive mother, had wreaked havoc in the kitchen, Monica's winter solstice feast had consisted of crackers──had been accidentally revealed. Yet, this setting was also mentioned in Isabelle's diary.\nMonica hastily thought back to the contents of the diary she had read the previous night.\n\"Um…well…um…at the Count Kerbeck's house, we had a lot of amazing feasts. There were crispy meat pies, hearty soups, and gingerbread cake loaded with white sugar…\"\nHowever, in Isabelle's diary, Monica is portrayed as barely able to enjoy these feasts, shivering while slurping a meager vegetable broth at the farthest seat from the fireplace.\n\"…But I saw that girl picking up a piece of gingerbread cake I dropped and eating it. Oh, how unsightly! She looked just like a stray dog!\"\nThat was a passage from the diary. But how could she explain this?\nAs Monica fumbled for words, Lana, Glenn, and Neil all looked at her sympathetically.\n\"…Today, let's have a proper meal in the cafeteria. You should join us.\"\n\"…Sniff…sniff…I feel so bad for Monica…\"\n\"…Um, what should I say… You've been through a lot.\"\nApparently, based on their reactions, the three of them had interpreted it as \"Monica only had crackers and pickles while Count Kerbeck's house had an amazing feast,\" which wasn't that different from Isabelle's diary's setting.\nFor now, since it wasn't too different from Isabelle's diary's content, Monica decided to smile ambiguously and play it off.",

      "content": "After the orientation, when Monica went to the student council room, the other student council members were already seated at the meeting table. Although she wasn't late, she felt a little embarrassed arriving last, so Monica lowered her head and took her seat, apologizing to the other members.\nStudent Council President: Felix Ark Ridill\nVice President: Cyril Ashley\nSecretaries: Elliot Howard and Bridget Graham\nGeneral Affairs: Neil Clay Maywood\nTreasurer: Monica Norton\nWith these six people assembled, Felix opened his mouth with a gentle smile.\n\"I am truly delighted that these six are gathered here in this place. As we enter the new year, may the blessings of the Goddess of Light, Serendine, shine upon our academy.\"\nStarting with Felix's words, the first student council meeting of the new year began.\nThe term for the student council members is already about halfway through at this point.\nThe term had about six months remaining. Due to the extended vacation period from early summer to the end of summer during the social season at Serendia Academy, it would actually pass in the blink of an eye.\nDuring the remaining six months, there are several events, relatively small in scale. Various clubs host their own small events, like the Hunting Club's hunting-gathering, the Equestrian Club's horse riding event, or the Chorus Club's performance. The scale is about the same as that of a chess tournament.\nThe major events include the Student Assembly held in early spring and the graduation ceremony held just before the long summer break in early summer.\nWhen Felix roughly explained the schedule for the latter half of the term, Elliot looked at Monica and smirked.\n\"The Student Assembly is where Treasurer Norton really shines\"\n\"Huh!?\"\n\"Representatives from each club come forward, pressuring for increased budgets. Oh man, last year was something else. The treasurer was summoned to tea parties day after day…\"\nAccording to Elliot's account, a budget meeting is held before the Student Assembly, during which the budgets for each club are mostly decided. However, it seems that a behind-the-scenes battle among the club leaders ensued before this budget meeting even took place.\nAs club leaders, it's only natural that they want their budgets increased. However, making a direct appeal to Felix, the Student Council President, goes against the etiquette of the nobility.\nIn the noble society, it's customary to seek an audience with the Chancellor of the Exchequer before appealing directly to the King.\nTherefore, the club leaders first try to persuade the treasurer and make arrangements behind the scenes during the budget meeting, so that their clubs can receive favorable treatment.\nAs the budget meeting draws near, it's a yearly tradition for the treasurer to be invited to tea parties hosted by various club leaders. It's not difficult to imagine what takes place during these tea parties.\n\"If it were just a reception under the guise of a tea party, that would still be on the milder side. Some individuals even go so far as to offer bribes, or they use their family backgrounds as a shield to make veiled threats.\"\n\"Eeek…\"\nMonica let out a small gasp as her face turned pale, and Felix gently admonished Elliot in a soothing voice.\n\"You're the one who dislikes such customs the most, isn't that right? Please refrain from scaring her too much.\"\n\"But it's the truth, isn't it? Last year's treasurer was easily swayed by bribes, but it's clear that Norton Accounting doesn't accept bribes… and when it comes to that, there are quite a few who think that threatening is the quicker way.\"\nMonica's predecessor, the heir of Count Stale, Aaron O'Brian, was a person who embezzled the student council's budget. Not content with that alone, he apparently went as far as accepting bribes at tea parties.\nAs Monica trembled, Felix cleared his throat and chuckled softly, then glanced at Elliot.\n\"You're certain that Monica wouldn't accept bribes?\"\n\"…You can tell by just looking.\"\n\"Yeah, you're right. It's as you say.\"\nInitially critical of Monica, Elliot now appreciated her fairness. Felix was teasing Elliot about this, but Monica was no longer paying attention to such banter.\nIn Monica's mind, the scene of her being threatened by the club leaders at the tea party spun around and around like a whirlpool.\nOh no, scary, scary, scary, I'm scared of the budget meeting…\nTears welled up in Monica's eyes as she trembled. Cyril raised his hand and spoke up.\n\"In that case, how about we completely forbid inviting Norton Accounting to tea parties until after the budget meeting?\"\nMonica found a glimmer of hope in Cyril's suggestion and nodded eagerly. However, Felix promptly rejected Cyril's proposal.\n\"I can't agree to take away her social opportunities.\"\nMonica's true feelings were more like, \"Feel free to take them away,\" but she couldn't say that.\nApart from the personal tea party with Lana and classes, the only other tea party Monica had attended was the one that had turned into an attempted poisoning incident. Yet, it seemed that Felix's objection wasn't solely due to that.\n\"Even though it's a precaution for the budget meeting, being too overt about it might cause the club leaders to push back.\"\n\"I've been thoughtless. I apologize,\" Cyril yielded to Felix's words easily.\nOh, what a promising suggestion it was… Monica felt disheartened. From now on, if she received invitations to tea parties from anyone other than close friends, she could almost certainly assume it was related to the budget meeting.\nIn theory, Monica could just firmly decline all of them, but when the invitee was an upperclassman, it wasn't that simple. Most of the club leaders were seniors compared to Monica.\nLost in her thoughts about what to do, Bridget, who had been silent until now, finally spoke up.\n\"If that's the case, I have a suggestion.\"\nIt was unusual for Bridget to interject when it came to matters involving Monica.\nDespite the attention of everyone present, Bridget calmly shared her opinion without a hint of expression.\n\"How about having me accompany Monica Norton to any tea parties she's invited to? It would be easier for me to attend than gentlemen, and it might serve as a deterrent against any misconduct.\"\nIndeed, if Bridget were to accompany Monica, the club leaders might think twice before acting too boldly. Bridget hailed from the prestigious Marquis Sheilburry's family. If they tried any veiled threats against her, they might end up putting a noose around their own necks.\nFelix looked at Bridget as if searching for something, and in return, Bridget responded with a graceful smile.\n\"What do you think?\"\n\"Not a bad suggestion,\" Felix remarked.\nWhile Monica was still flustered, the conversation seemed to be coming together.\nMonica knew that Bridget didn't hold a particularly favorable opinion of her. Yet, she couldn't fathom why Bridget had made such a suggestion.\nWas it purely out of consideration for the Student Council, or…?\nTo keep an eye on me, to make sure I don't embarrass the Student Council during tea parties…\nIt was quite plausible.\nAs Monica was lost in thought about reviewing the tea party protocol for class, the conversation appeared to be settling.\nFelix looked at Monica and asked, \"Is that okay?\"\nWith that kind of question, Monica couldn't possibly refuse. Besides, having Bridget with her would be much better than facing the club leaders alone… probably, even though it might still be an uncomfortable situation.\n\"Y-yes, please…\"\nMonica lowered her head to Bridget, who responded with a gentle smile on her beautiful face.\n\"Well, don't mind it too much. After all, we're both members of the same Student Council.\"\nThe moment Monica heard those words, a shiver ran down her spine. Why was that?\nBridget's flawless, beautiful smile somehow resembled Felix's.\nFeeling the chill, Monica discreetly rubbed her arm as Felix muttered, \"That should be enough for today.\"\n\"Let's just limit today's discussion to our future plans. Regular tasks will start tomorrow… Oh, and this is a personal request of mine.\"\nFelix narrowed his azure eyes and glanced around at the Student Council members before continuing.\n\"I'm looking for a girl with a certain situation; she has an injured left hand. If you find her, could you let me know?\"\nMonica's heart pounded so loudly it seemed almost audible.\nSuppressing the twitching of her facial muscles and maintaining a stiff expression, she was as rigid as a statue when Neil, sitting next to her, inquired.\n\"By ‘girl,' do you mean a female student in the senior division?\"\n\"It might even be someone from the junior division, or perhaps a student assistant. One thing is certain: she's not a staff member… I've already looked into that.\"\nHe'd already investigated staff members!?\nHe worked so quickly it's scary. Monica couldn't help but stare at Felix with a look as if she were seeing something terrifying.\nNext, Cyril spoke up.\n\"Are there any other distinguishing features? For instance, height or hair color…\"\n\"Unfortunately, I don't have much of that kind of information. But, well… she's quite petite. Maybe about the same height as Monica.\"\nMonica struggled to stifle the voice that almost slipped out. Fortunately, her nervousness was nothing new, so no one noticed that she was on the brink of collapse. Still, she was drenched in cold sweat under her uniform.\nCyril remained silent for a moment but then cautiously asked Felix.\n\"…What kind of person is this woman to His Highness?\"\n\"More like a benefactor, I'd say. Yeah, I really want to meet her no matter what.\"\nWith those words, Felix's sweet smile momentarily appeared. It was a smile he directed at the Silent Witch.\nOh, Felix was undoubtedly convinced that the Silent Witch was indeed at Serendia Academy. He was determined to find her.\nUnconsciously, Monica withdrew her left hand under the desk and held it with her right hand.\nWhat should I do? Should I forcefully use my left hand and try to show that my left hand isn't injured? But somehow, that might look suspicious… Aaaah…\nMonica was lost in her turmoil, while across from her, Cyril wore a contemplative expression.\nElliot lightly teased Cyril, \"You're acting strangely. The usual Cyril would probably say something like, ‘If His Highness desires it, I'll do everything in my power to find this woman!'\"\n\"Even without saying it, I'll do everything in my power if it's His Highness's desire.\"\nCyril retorted with a confident tone, yet he still seemed somewhat distracted.\nAmidst the slightly awkward silence, Bridget casually inquired, \"By the way, isn't Monica Norton falling under those categories?\"\nMonica felt like her eyes were about to pop out and screamed internally.\nOf course, it is! If anything I'm probably the one His Highness is looking for!\nMonica's diaphragm had been spasming oddly for a while now, and it was making hiccup-like noises. Despite that, Monica managed to muster all her strength to maintain her expression and voice.\n\"I, um, my left hand isn't injured…\"\nMonica said, pulling off her left-hand glove and demonstrating by clenching and unclenching her hand. This action was actually quite painful, but she desperately endured to keep her composure.\nFelix stared intently at Monica's raised, petite hand.\n\"Right, you're not her.\"\n\"Y-yes.\"\n\"So, you'll help me find her, won't you? Oh, now that I remember, Monica, you're pretty good at finding people, right? You could tell a person's size just by looking… You should have measured their size beforehand.\"\nWhat in the world…!\nWith that muttered aside, Monica felt like she was about to collapse entirely. Still, somehow she managed to navigate through this situation.\nOh wow, I didn't faint… this is amazing!\nFeeling moved by her own growth, Monica didn't notice that Cyril was gazing at her left hand, which she had been clenching and unclenching for an extended period, with a serious expression.",

      "content": "On the first day of the semester, during the day of the first elective class, Eliane Hyatt swiftly gathered her belongings and stood up when it was time to move. With a gentle smile, she turned to her classmate, who always accompanied her during these transitions, and said, \"I have some work to submit, so I'll excuse myself ahead.\"\nSaying this, Eliane left the classroom and walked briskly down the hallway, just within the limits allowed for a young lady. Her destination was neither the staff room nor the classroom for elective courses.\n…If he's moving from his classroom to the Practical Magic classroom, he's definitely going to pass through this hallway…\nEliane stopped at the corner of the hallway, looking around nervously, absentmindedly adjusting her hair, and waited for the person she was looking for to arrive. Eventually, a familiar voice reached her from beyond the corner.\nIn this prestigious academy attended by the children of nobility, a particularly lively voice echoed. There was no mistaking it. As Eliane turned the corner of the hallway with a completely natural stride, she saw a bit further away a person with golden-brown hair.\nLet's say I just happened to pass through this hallway for my submission, I happened to spot Lord Glenn, and I stopped to say, \"Good day, Lord Glenn. I'm grateful for your assistance during the winter break. How is your health?\" …Yes, it was very natural. It couldn't have been a more natural conversation.\nSatisfied with her flawless plan, Eliane closed the distance between her and Glenn… and then, she froze.\nWalking beside Glenn was a tall female student. She had straight black hair, fair skin, and azure-colored eyes. She was a young lady of overwhelming beauty that left everyone in awe. One of the three most beautiful girls in the academy, just like Eliane, was Claudia Ashley. Despite her tall stature for a young lady, Claudia's proportions were perfectly balanced when standing alongside the tall Glenn, and they looked astonishingly harmonious.\nWhy Claudia was walking alongside Glenn… As Eliane stood there in shock, Glenn noticed her first and stopped in his tracks.\n\"Oh, Ellie, long time no see!\"\n\"Ah, yes…\"\nThe impact of seeing Glenn and Claudia walking together had completely blown away the prepared words in Eliane's mind.\nEliane, who was fidgeting nervously, was met with Claudia's doll-like sapphire eyes, which stared fixedly at her. However, in Claudia's eyes, there was no hint of interest towards Eliane. She was merely looking because there were people in her path, nothing more. It was a gaze devoid of any interest or curiosity, unlike Eliane, who was conscious of Claudia.\nThis lack of attention from Claudia pricked at Eliane's pride and insecurities.\n\"Well, it seems Lord Glenn and Lady Ashley are quite close. I had no idea,\" Eliane said, speaking a bit faster than usual, and Claudia blinked slowly.\n\"…We're not that close.\"\n\"That's right! We're friends.\"\nGlenn's booming voice drowned out Claudia's mumbled response. Claudia, with an impassive expression that still managed to convey her displeasure to anyone looking, spoke in a low voice.\n\"…I was just walking with Neil.\"\nIt was only then that Eliane noticed another male student as if hiding in the shadows behind Glenn and Claudia. He was Neil Clay Maywood, the General Affairs Officer of the Student Council and Claudia's fiance.\nNeil, with his unassuming and petite stature, was usually quite inconspicuous. However, in the presence of prominent figures like Glenn and Claudia, his presence seemed to fade even more into the background. As Eliane felt embarrassed for having accidentally overlooked Neil, he approached her with a friendly smile.\n\"Hello, Miss Hyatt. The cursed dragon incident must have been terrible. Is everyone in the Duke's household doing well?\"\n\"Yes, thank you for your concern.\"\nWhile Eliane wasn't particularly close to Neil, they had some familiarity with each other. Neil's father often visited the Reinberg Duchy due to their work-related connections.\nBaron Maywood, a nationally recognized arbiter, had an especially wide network among the domestic nobility. Recently, he was often dispatched to mediate whenever disputes arose, particularly concerning the new Dragon Knight Order's garrison. Despite Eliane's higher social standing, it was not advisable to treat members of the Maywood Baron family with disrespect. Therefore, she engaged Neil in some polite small talk.\n\"It seems you are close with the Glenn, Lord Maywood. Perhaps you have elective classes together as well?\"\n\"Yes, that's right. We're in the Practical Magic class. And what about you, Miss Hyatt?\"\n\"I'm taking Music classes. However, I still have much to learn… It's quite embarrassing.\"\n\"Not at all. I've had the pleasure of hearing you play the harp before, and you're quite skilled.\"\n\"Well, I'm flattered.\"\nWhile conversing with Neil, Eliane occasionally glanced at Glenn out of the corner of her eye.\n…Feel free to join the conversation if you'd like. You're welcome to inquire about listening to my harp playing. If you're really eager, perhaps I could arrange for a performance in the music room after school…\nLooking at Eliane with hopeful eyes, Glenn responded with a cheerful smile.\n\"You two look kinda cute when talking together.\"\nHe wore an expression much like an older brother watching over younger kids. The light faded from Neil's eyes as he fretted about his youthful appearance, and Eliane, who often worried about seeming too childish, felt a twitch in her cheeks. Meanwhile, Claudia silently pinched Glenn's back.\n\"Oh, look, there's a bug here.\"\n\"Ahh! Stop, stop, stop, wait…\"\n\"…You have to be thorough when dealing with bugs. *pinch, pinch, pinch*…\"\n\"Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch! You're just plainly bullying me!\"\nAlthough Claudia was pinching Glenn's back, it seemed like, for some reason, other parts of him were twitching and spasming. Moreover, his reaction to just being pinched on the back was far from ordinary.\n\"Um, Lord Glenn… by any chance, is your body still…\"\nAt Eliane's words, Claudia suddenly stopped her pinching. Glenn, with teary eyes, had been rubbing his pinched back, but he quickly flashed his usual smile, showing his white teeth.\n\"Just kidding. It's really not a big deal at all!\"\n\"Is that so… well, if you say so…\"\nAs Eliane's expression darkened, thinking back to when Glenn had collapsed from a curse, Glenn suddenly exclaimed, \"Ah!\" in a loud voice.\n\"We should head to class soon, or we'll be late!\" Glenn said, and Neil nodded in agreement.\n\"Well then, shall we go? Excuse us, Miss Hyatt.\"\n\"Yes, take care.\"\nAs they exchanged farewells and prepared to leave, Glenn suddenly stopped in his tracks, his gaze unnaturally fixed on a male student walking toward him from ahead. Eliane was somewhat compelled to follow Glenn's gaze and looked at the male student in front of him.\nHe was a tall, fiery red-haired student with a face featuring a slender chin and long limbs, giving him an almost mantis-like appearance. His uniform was sloppily worn, lacking the prescribed gloves, and his fingers were adorned with numerous rugged rings.\n…A delinquent.\nJudging from the sleeve line of his uniform, he appeared to be a third-year student in the senior division, but Eliane had no recollection of ever seeing this boy before. However, Glenn continued to stare at the male student with a tense expression. Did he know this person?\nAs Eliane pondered this question, the red-haired boy yawned and spoke, \"Hey, you guys. Do you know where the Advanced Practical Magic classroom is?\"\nThe moment the red-haired boy asked this, Glenn's face contorted. The expression that Eliane witnessed for the first time was one of strong and intense anger.\n\"Why are you here?!\"\nGlenn's angry outburst, which was already quite loud due to his usual volume, caused the windows to tremble. Eliane couldn't help but flinch, her shoulders trembling. Claudia remained as expressionless as ever, but Neil looked startled as he watched Glenn. However, the red-haired boy, crucially, seemed indifferent, sticking his fingers in his ears and speaking with an air of nonchalance.\n\"Who are you?\"\n\"…!!\"\n\"Have we met somewhere before? I don't remember. If I don't remember, you must be probably…\"\nThe boy's eyes, showing a hint of disbelief, wandered as if he were trying to recall a memory. Eventually, his gaze circled back to Glenn. And then, with a slight smile on his lips, he said,\n\"…the loser, huh?\"\nA grinding sound reached Eliane's ears from above, the sound of Glenn gritting his teeth. Glenn, like a ready-to-pounce wild dog, was leaning forward. However, before Glenn could take a step forward, Neil stood in front of him.\n\"Are you a transfer student by any chance? The Advanced Practical Magic classroom is on the first floor, east side. Go down the stairs ahead, and it's the third classroom on the right.\"\n\"Hmm, got it. Thanks.\"\nThe red-haired boy said only that before turning his back on Glenn and the others. Glenn continued to glare at the boy's back with eyes filled with anger until the boy's figure disappeared around the corner of the hallway.",

      "content": "Navigating the hallways while trying not to attract too much attention, Monica eventually reached the elective class and slouched into an unoccupied seat, utterly drained. Two male students, Elliott Howard and Benjamin Moulding, who were taking the same chess class, settled into seats beside her.\n\"Oh, I can hear it, I can hear it! The Symphony of Sorrow! It washes over mankind's hearts like a torrent of rain, drenching them in grief and despair. The tears that spill from their eyes flow into the sea, embarking on a profound journey. At its end lies a revelation—a choice to lift the veil of despair or to embrace the resolve to lose everything! Oh, what did the traveler witness with their own eyes? That answer will unfold in the final movement! …well, Miss Norton, you seem like that traveler who was about to enter the final movement, but are you all right?\"\n\"….um.\"\nAs Monica found herself at a loss for words, Elliott interjected half-heartedly.\n\"If I were to paraphrase, it would be something like ‘You look gloomy, but are you really okay?'\"\n\"Gloomy! With that single word, we can encapsulate musicality, expand the world, and play our roles as musicians! Without that, what sets us apart as musicians?\"\nMonica responded with a wry smile, partially lost in Benjamin's world of thoughts.\n\"Um… I'm sorry for making you worry. I'm fine, really.\"\n\"You're still dwelling on that budget meeting from the other day, aren't you?\"\nMonica smiled vaguely at Elliott's words.\n\"…something like that.\"\nThe truth was, that was not the only thing bothering Monica. Right now, she has more than one problem to deal with. Her biggest concern was about Duke Crockford. She desperately wanted to know how involved he was in her father's death. Furthermore, she was curious about why Felix seemed to be so obedient to the Duke, and what Felix's true intentions were. Despite these concerns, Monica had to fulfill her duty as Felix's bodyguard in their current situation.\nThe man known as Yuan, a user of body manipulation magic, was another mystery. She still didn't know why he had approached Felix. In the future, there was also the possibility of other assassins targeting Felix's life. She couldn't let her guard down.\nAnd on top of all that, His Highness is already aware that the ‘Silent Witch' is at the academyyyyyy…\nCurrently, the student council members under Felix's instructions discreetly checked the left hand of a petite female student. According to Ray's estimation, it would take a few more weeks for Monica to be able to use her left hand normally. Until then, she had to find a way to conceal her injured hand.\nThe spy who had infiltrated Kerbeck's territory loomed large over Monica. It appeared that Isabelle and her associates had managed to outwit their pursuers somehow, but someone was still doggedly searching for her.\nYet, the most immediate and anxiety-inducing concern centered around the mention of the \"senior\" in Bernie's letter. The mere thought of encountering that senior sent shivers down Monica's spine. Just sharing the same school building with him for the next six months felt like a descent into madness. She yearned to lock herself away in the attic.\nThere's so much to do but she is unsure of where to begin. And yet, the net woven by those determined to unveil Monica's true identity was steadily closing in.\nUgh… My stomach churns…\nDuring this class, at the very least, she wanted her thoughts to revolve solely around chess. That seemed like the safest choice. As she contemplated this, Mr. Boyd, who perpetually resembled a brawny mercenary, swung open the classroom door and entered. With a brief admonition for silence, Mr. Boyd instantly quelled the chattering students. He nodded in approval and then began to address the class.\n\"I'd like to introduce a new transfer student. Please come in.\"\nAt the mention of a transfer student, Monica's mind raced, thinking that it might be Hubert Dee, the very person who had been haunting her thoughts.\nC-Could it be… Dee-senpai!?\nHowever, Monica's anticipation was misplaced. She already knew who this transfer student was. A young man, bearing himself like a seasoned soldier, cleared his throat and began to speak, standing at rigid attention.\n\"I am Roberto Vinkel, a first-year transfer student to the Advanced Course. I humbly request your guidance.\"\nElliott and Benjamin cast identical glances at Monica.\nHalfway through Roberto's introduction, Monica succumbed to unconsciousness as her eyes rolled back.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAfter suffering defeat at Monica's hands in the chess tournament and having his overtures for an engagement centered around chess rejected, Roberto Vinkel, the fifth son of the Baron House in the Randall Kingdom, promptly submitted his application for withdrawal from the \"Institute\" and made a decisive move to transfer to Serendia Academy.\nThe faculty at the \"Institute\" paled as they attempted to dissuade Roberto, but his determination remained steadfast as steel.\nHis ambition was to ascend to the pinnacle of chess mastery on a global scale. To accomplish this lofty aspiration, he had chosen to study abroad in the Ridill Kingdom, renowned for its abundance of skilled chess players compared to Randall. While the \"Institute\" indeed housed several formidable talents, it was devoid of anyone he could consider a worthy rival. Hence, transferring to a school renowned for even stronger players seemed the logical progression of his journey.\nEnrolling in Serendia Academy afforded Roberto the opportunity to indulge in chess matches to his heart's content, particularly against Monica Norton, the young woman who had defeated him. Moreover, if he could secure her agreement to an engagement during their time at the academy, he would be able to continue having a match with her even after graduation—what a perfectly crafted life plan.\nHowever, Roberto faced a dilemma. His proficiency extended to chess, academics, equestrianism, and swordsmanship, but he remained utterly clueless when it came to matters of love. The finer arts and subjects that might pique a woman's interest eluded his grasp.\nConsequently, following his departure from the \"Institute,\" Roberto resolved to return to his hometown, the Randall Kingdom. There, he intended to consult with his four elder brothers. He was confident his reliable brothers would be able to give him invaluable guidance.\n\"What's your strategy to capture a woman's heart you really want to grasp, dear elder brothers?\"\nWhen the youngest brother asked this question with the utmost seriousness, the four older brothers' expressions changed dramatically.\nOh, our little Roberto! The boy who only thought about chess! Our adorable little brother! He's finally interested in romance!\nAfter the initial excitement among the brothers, they each took turns imparting their advice.\nFirst, the eldest brother, flexing his muscular biceps, said as he created a bulge in his arm, \"Ladies adore a well-built man! Roberto, you have an impressive physique. Showcase it. Especially those biceps! Women can't resist a man's biceps!\"\n\"Ah, I see, biceps,\" Roberto mentally noted.\nNext, the second brother, with a charming smile on his face, said, \"The most important thing is physical compatibility, you know? Ah, Roberto. I can vouch for your ‘size' since I've seen it since childhood. I'm sure the ladies will be satisfied, so approach with confidence.\"\nRoberto, convinced by the brother who was the most experienced with women among them, took this advice to heart.\nNext, the third brother, while sweeping his slightly long bangs aside, said, \"You know, aren't we relying on our bodies a bit too much, brothers? When it comes to pleasing a girl, poetry is the way to go. Create a heartfelt poem for her, and she'll surely appreciate it.\"\n\"But, third elder brother… I've never written poetry,\" Roberto replied with concern.\n\"Don't worry,\" the third brother reassured him confidently. \"When in doubt, use flowers. Compare her to a flower, like ‘As I gazed upon the garden's bloom, I was reminded of you.' Something along those lines will do.\"\nIt might be a somewhat simplistic piece of advice, but Roberto was impressed nonetheless, considering it came from his brother with a talent for writing.\nFinally, the fourth brother, holding a beloved dog against his chest, spoke calmly, \"We have three incredibly clever and cute dogs at home, you know? You shouldn't miss the chance to show them off. Hey, Roberto, wouldn't it be wonderful to become a family with those little guys? I'm sure she'll think so too. After all, our dogs are incredibly cute.\"\nSaying this, the fourth brother affectionately rubbed the cheek of a stern-looking military dog.\nRoberto nodded and added this advice to his mental notes: showcasing their adorable family dogs could be an excellent strategy.\nWith the counsel of his four elder brothers firmly etched in his heart, Roberto Vinkel crossed borders once more and arrived at Serendia Academy. Here, he was resolved to confront Monica Norton, a remarkable chess player, once again and endeavor to secure her agreement for their engagement.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"Hey, Miss Norton, wake up. Hey.\"\nMonica regained her consciousness through Elliott's persistent nudging from the neighboring table. The period of free-play chess had already opened, and the task now was to find opponents and engage in chess matches until the end of the class.\nOh, right, chess. Let's focus on chess. I need to play chess to clear my thoughts… Monica resolved as her faculties returned. Approaching her with conspicuous strides was none other than Roberto.\nDespite the chilly midwinter weather, Roberto had shed his uniform jacket and rolled up his shirt sleeves to the extreme, revealing his well-toned biceps.\nMonica watched in amazement at his complete disregard for the season as Roberto came to a halt before her.\n\"It's been a while, Miss Monica.\"\n\"Uh… y-yes.\"\nMonica replied with a stiff nod, resembling a traveler who had stumbled upon a bear in the forest. Roberto proceeded to produce a piece of paper from his pocket and unfolded it with an air of purpose.\n\"I've composed a poem for you.\"\n\"…Huh?\"\n\"Please listen.\"\nWith an entirely earnest expression, Roberto commenced reciting a poem he had evidently inscribed on the paper.\n\"‘While gazing at the white flowers in the garden, thoughts of the white chess pieces crossed my mind.\nYour 53rd move with the white rook was splendid.\nI want to play chess with you again.\nI cannot forget your chess.' –\nRoberto Vinkel.\n\"\nIn the hushed and tranquil classroom, Robert's voice resonated exceptionally well, and it should be noted that he possessed an unnecessarily beautiful baritone voice. The students in the classroom were playing chess while observing this exchange with bated breath. In particular, Elliott, who was in the nearest seat, had a face that showed his confusion, and Benjamin was muttering, \"Is that a poem? That's a poem? Oh, it's not musical… It's not beautiful…\"\n\"Robert Vinkel. Please maintain silence during the match,\" said Mr. Boyd the teacher, and Robert lowered his head with a sincere attitude.\n\"Yes, I apologize for making noise in this sacred chess-playing venue. Please forgive me. I wanted to convey my feelings to her as soon as possible.\"\nMonica, who had attracted the attention of the entire classroom, thought to herself. The recent \"poem\" seemed to be an expression of his desire to play chess with Monica, judging from the context.\nSo, this is like… a challenge for a chess match…?\nAs Monica was puzzled, Robert took out another piece of paper and handed it to her.\n\"And also, please take a look at this.\"\n\"Um, what is this…?\"\n\"I've drawn my family's dogs. I think I did quite well.\"\nMonica cautiously accepted the folded paper and gently unfolded it. There were three objects depicted that could only be described as \"four-legged somethings.\" According to Robert, they were his family's dogs.\nIs he asking for feedback on this… drawing?\nAs Monica struggled with her response, Robert continued earnestly.\n\"Regarding the engagement, I hope you will consider it positively.\"\nEh!? Wait, is this where the conversation was heading now!?\nWith her mouth agape, Monica watched as Elliott and Benjamin, seated next to her, put their hands to their foreheads with solemn expressions.\n\"I have a bad feeling about this… This is definitely going to be a repeat of the chess tournament… It's definitely going to get complicated…\"\n\"Oh dear, what a situation. His lack of musical approach is fatal… His sensibility has withered away…\"\nThe two senior students at the neighboring desks had paused their chess game to mutter, but their comments did not reach either Robert or Monica.\nRobert, maintaining his composure, sat down in front of Monica and began arranging the chess pieces on the board.\n\"Shall we commence our match?\"\n\"Uh, yes…\"\nMonica had trouble understanding the purpose of Robert's actions, but she assumed he simply wanted to play chess. So, she came to a rough conclusion.\nAs she awkwardly arranged the chess pieces, Monica couldn't help but glance at Robert's attire, which had been bothering her.\n\"Um… Aren't you cold with your sleeves rolled up like that?\"\n\"Not at all. I exercise every day.\"\n\"I see…\"\nMonica wondered if it was a custom for Randall's knights to roll up their sleeves even in the middle of winter. As Monica contemplated this, Roberto suddenly recollected something, his tone suggesting it had just occurred to him.\n\"Oh, and…\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"I've received a seal of approval from my brothers about my size. I'm sure it would satisfy you, Miss Monica.\"\nWhat does he mean by his size?… Does he mean… his height?\nNot quite understanding, Monica responded with a vague \"Uh-huh.\"",

      "content": "When Glenn was first taken in as an apprentice by Louis Miller the Barrier Magician, he wasn't particularly enthusiastic about studying magic.\nPrior to his apprenticeship with Louis, Glenn had been responsible for a magical disaster that left a portion of Minerva Academy's building in ruins. What if he repeated such a disastrous event? What if this time his uncontrollable magical outburst caused harm, or worse, claimed lives? The mere contemplation sent shivers down his spine, rendering the very thought of harnessing magic unbearable.\nSo, Glenn resolved to be forthright and convey his sentiments to Louis.\n\"…I, I really don't want to study magic.\"\nFully aware of the potential for severe rebuke, Glenn poured his honest feelings.\nHis fear of another catastrophic failure was paralyzing. The thought of injuring someone weighed heavily on him, and in truth, he was growing weary of magic.\nTo his astonishment, Louis responded in a rather casual manner.\n\"Oh, that's quite reassuring.\"\n\"Huh…?\"\n\"It's reassuring to hear you receive such setbacks this early.\"\nLouis waved his slender fingers, then pointed them directly at Glenn's forehead. Behind his monocle, Louis's grayish-purple eyes emitted a frigid glint.\n\"Up until now, you've been a mere plaything of the power you acquired with little effort.\"\nThe term \"acquired with little effort\" stung, prompting Glenn to respond with a forceful tone.\n\"I, I did study properly at Minerva! I even did a secret special training!\"\nAs Glenn furrowed his brow and defended his case, Louis couldn't contain his laughter, finding it immensely entertaining.\nGlenn pursed his lips, glaring at Louis.\n\"…What's so funny?\"\n\"It's quite entertaining to hear a youngster like you, who underwent a mere three months of amateur instruction, claim to comprehend the intricacies of magic.\"\n\"………\"\n\"Those who label half-hearted training as ‘effort' are rather fortunate, wouldn't you say? They can easily attain a sense of accomplishment.\"\nIn Glenn's perspective, Louis might as well be known as the \"Sarcastic Mage\" rather than the \"Barrier Magician.\" His tone remained courteous, but his words were consistently sharp.\nAs Glenn lapsed into a disgruntled silence, Louis smiled with a trace of mischief.\n\"Those who grow complacent without ever experiencing setbacks will eventually face painful lessons. It's good that you've learned early.\"\nThough Glenn couldn't entirely refute the accusation of complacency, it was frustrating to hear it from someone else. At the very least, he had grown complacent after receiving the prophecy, believing he was chosen.\n\"People who acquire things without any effort can lose them in an instant. So, you better start building from scratch now. You still have time for that.\"\n\"But… I'm still scared of using offensive magic.\"\nHe was prepared to be called a coward when he confessed his apprehension. In response, Louis, donning a contemplative expression, brought his slender fingers to his chin, as if pondering a matter of great consequence.\n\"Hmm… In that case, let's start with some enjoyable magic.\"\n\"Enjoyable magic?\"\nWith a perplexed countenance, Glenn received Louis's wink, imbued with a touch of mischief.\n\"Wouldn't you like soaring freely through the skies?\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nLately, Monica has been experiencing days filled with constant unease.\nWhen moving around the classroom, she must constantly be on edge, worried about encountering Hubert Dee. And when she's in the classroom, Roberto Vinkel often barges in, inviting her to play chess.\nWhile chess is indeed enjoyable, engaging in matches outside of class inevitably leads to discussions about their engagement and other uncomfortable topics. Moreover, the scrutiny from her classmates is painful.\nRoberto, a recent transfer student to the senior division, seems to be drawing even more attention than Monica had anticipated.\nBeing a foreign exchange student from Randall is unusual enough, but he also achieved victory over the top-ranked student in their grade during a swordsmanship class, or so the rumors say. It's becoming increasingly difficult to keep these matters from becoming common knowledge.\nShe had confided in Lana about her situation, but it hadn't really made things much better.\nSo, on afternoons when there were no student council duties, Monica decided to slip out of the classroom before Roberto arrived and spend her time in the school library. Serendia Academy's library was well-stocked, offering endless opportunities to pass the time.\nRight now, Monica is searching for books related to biology.\nIn order to understand some of the texts from her father's books that she had obtained from Porter's Antiquarian Bookstore, a basic knowledge of biology was often necessary. Therefore, she wanted to review any terms she didn't understand in her father's books and read the referenced scientific papers. It's quite common for scholars to read other books to understand the one they're currently studying.\nThe library at Serendia Academy was located in a separate building from the student dormitories.\nWhile there were plenty of books related to magic, it seemed like Serendia Academy had a much larger collection in other fields.\nNo matter how many times I come here, it's still impressive…\nImpressed, Monica reached for the book she was looking for but winced as she tried to open it. Her left hand, which hadn't fully regained its grip strength yet, made it difficult to hold open thick books.\nRealizing that reading while standing wouldn't be practical, Monica decided to carry the book to the reading area.\nThe library was equipped with study desks and comfortable sofas for leisurely reading.\nAs Monica searched for an available seat, she spotted a familiar chestnut-brown unruly hair in a nearby chair.\nOut of all Monica's acquaintances, Glenn Dudley was probably the person least likely to be found in a library.\nGlenn had a book opened in front of him, seemingly studying, but from the way he pursed his lips, furrowed his brows, and wrinkled his nose, it didn't appear to be going well.\nEven though they were acquaintances, Monica was somewhat hesitant to initiate a conversation herself. Nevertheless, she mustered a bit of courage and called out to Glenn from behind.\n\"Um, hello, Glenn.\"\nShe initiated a conversation with a friend! And during their study time!\nBasking in this minor accomplishment, Glenn looked up from his book.\n\"Hello. Are you here to study too, Monica?\"\n\"No, I'm here for some reading… Are you studying, Glenn-san?\"\n\"Well, sort of.\"\nMonica briefly glanced at the book Glenn had opened and was left speechless.\nThe book he was reading was a collection of research papers on shortened incantations. As it happened, Monica had also contributed to this book, and the page Glenn had opened was precisely the one with Monica's contribution.\nMonica suppressed her agitation and asked Glenn a question.\n\"Um, Glenn, do you… want to learn shortened incantations?\"\n\"I do… Without them, I'd be useless in real combat.\"\nAs Glenn muttered, his profile looked unusually stern, quite different from his usual cheerful self.\nWhen speaking of real combat, it was likely referring to battles where magic was employed, particularly the Magic Corps, known for their proficiency in combat magic. Glenn's master, Louis, had been the leader of the Magic Corps before becoming one of the Seven Sages.\nIn this Magic Corps, there were four crucial criteria evaluated during the entrance test.\nProficiency in shortened incantations. The ability to maintain two different spells simultaneously. Mastery of magic attributes beyond one's natural affinity. The capability to use Flight Magic. Among these criteria, shortened incantations were particularly emphasized.\nFor mages, the biggest vulnerability lay in the gap during incantation. Shortened incantations could reduce incantation time to less than half, minimizing that vulnerability.\nHowever, shortened incantations were like working through complex equations, thoroughly identifying areas where you could cut corners. In other words, it required a profound understanding of magic formulas.\nJudging by the magic formulas scattered across Glenn's notes, his understanding of magic formulas was the issue he needed to address before mastering Shortened Incantations.\nMonica recalled Glenn's words from a few days ago.\n\"I couldn't do anything at all. It was the Student Council President and the ‘Silent Witch' who defeated the Cursed Dragon!\"\nDuring that time, he seemed in his usual cheerful self, but maybe deep down, he was feeling incredibly frustrated.\n\"Um, Glenn, do you… maybe, feel concerned about the Cursed Dragon incident?\"\n\"Well… that's part of it.\"\nGlenn spoke hesitantly and let his gaze wander for a moment. A bitter expression crossed his face, unusual for his usually lively self.\n\"There's also someone I don't want to lose to.\"\nIf a friend was in trouble, she wanted to help. However, if she intervened in magic discussions here, it might reveal her true identity. After all, Monica Norton was considered an amateur when it came to magic.\n\"But, um, Glenn, why did you choose this book to learn short incantations?\"\n\"Because it had a paper written by the ‘Silent Witch'! You might not have seen it before, but the ‘Silent Witch' is really amazing! She can use magic without saying a word! I want to be able to use magic like that too…\"\nWhile internally breaking into a cold sweat at the mention of her own name, Monica thought quickly. She felt bad for Glenn's enthusiasm, but with his current level of understanding, not to mention no incantations, even shortening them would be impossible. It was like asking someone struggling with basic addition to master advanced calculus.\n\"Glenn, what kinds of magic can you use?\"\n\"I can use a fireball spell and a flight spell.\"\n\"Your affinity is fire, right?\"\n\"That's right.\"\nMonica was inwardly frustrated.\nH-His proficiency is too unreasonable…\nIf one's affinity is fire, then it is generally standard to teach intermediate-level fire manipulation spells first. However, in Glenn's case, fire magic only reached a basic level, and he strangely managed to master the most difficult wind attribute, the flight spell.\nWhy is fire magic only at a basic level, and then suddenly flight magic? What kind of teaching method did Louis use!?\nMonica was in distress, and Glenn started counting on his fingers as he explained.\n\"At first, he told me to find a spell that suits me, so he taught me various things like wind magic, earth magic, and ice magic, but I ended up causing a tornado, splitting the ground, or turning the training grounds into an ice rink, so it's hard to say that I can use them. My master told me not to use them until I understand the magic formula.\"\n…That's a rampage. It's pretty much all rampaging.\nGlenn had a lot of mana and was prone to rampaging. So, Monica guessed that he had tried various types of magic to see if there was anything he could use easily.\nHe was able to cast magic with the least affinity, so he's probably good at manipulating mana…\nIf that was the case, they should focus on teaching spells that were relatively simple in terms of magic formulas, even if they required somewhat complex mana manipulation. Flight magic was a prime example.\nWhile the magic formula itself was not that difficult, one needed excellent balance skills and high physical abilities to float in the air. (The reason Monica couldn't use flight magic was due to her lower physical abilities.)\nHowever, the fact that Glenn only had fireballs as an offensive means bothered Monica. Monica decided to ask a more specific question.\n\"Glenn, how well can you control fireballs? I mean, their power, speed…\"\n\"My master told me to thoroughly learn the nuances of their power and speed adjustments, so I've been practicing that a lot recently. I've got that part down.\"\n\"I see…\"\n\"Also, my master told me to be able to use offensive magic while using flight magic. So, I practiced that during the winter break with my master watching. I can manage it somewhat if I pause in mid-air, but I'm still not able to attack while flying around at high speed.\"\nAs Monica listened to Glenn's explanation, she started to understand Louis's teaching methods better.\nTo become a combat-ready magician suitable for the Magic Corps, there were four conditions: shortened incantation, maintaining two different spells simultaneously, using spells outside of one's affinity, and flight magic. Glenn had mastered almost everything except shortened incantation.\nDespite that, he could only use two spells: fireballs and flight magic. He likely prioritized learning the nuances of spellcasting through intuition rather than mindlessly increasing the variety of spells he could use. His approach was to enhance the precision of the spells he already knew.\nMonica, considering Glenn's personality, found this approach reasonable.\n\"So, the next step is shortened incantation, I guess,\"\nMonica couldn't help but become serious at Glenn's words. In simple terms, her blood as a magician was stirred.\n\"Glenn, shortened incantation and even no incantation are not as big a deal as you think.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"That's just about casting spells as quickly as possible.\"\nMonica was highly regarded as the world's only user of chantless magic, but she didn't see that much value in it herself.\nThe benefits of chantless magic are that it's quick to cast and can be used discreetly. However, Monica's belief was that these were the only advantages.\nShe argued that if that was the case, it was not much different from magic tools that required charging with mana.\n\"No matter how fast you get the jump on someone, it's useless if your attacks don't hit. So, Glenn, what you should learn next is tracking spell formulas.\"\nTracking spell formulas, as the name suggests, are formulas that give attack spells a certain degree of tracking capability. They are highly effective when you want to hit a moving target and are particularly useful in close-quarters combat. While the tracking capability may not be extremely high, it still makes a significant difference in accuracy compared to simply firing magic straight ahead.\nAttack spells are generally considered to have low accuracy. While it may be easier to hit larger targets like dragons, hitting smaller, agile creatures that move around is incredibly challenging.\n\"If you learn how to incorporate tracking spell formulas properly, you can apply them when using other attack spells. Shortening incantations is difficult because the method varies for each formula, so it's a tough task to learn them all. If you're going to learn, tracking spell formulas should come first, no doubt.\"\nAt that point, when Monica abruptly stopped talking, she found herself making eye contact with Glenn, who had a puzzled expression on his face.\nMonica turned pale in an instant.\nOh no, did I go too far? I definitely went too far!! I only intended to give some subtle advice, but this was way overboard!\nMonica anxiously let her gaze wander around while desperately trying to come up with an excuse.\n\"Well, you see, um, Lord Cyril mentioned something like that before…\"\n\"Oh, really! If the vice president, who's skilled in magic, says it, then it must be true! By the way, Monica, are you also studying magic?\"\n\"No! Not at all! I don't know anything about magic! This is just… um… casual conversation! It may have come up in casual conversation… or not…\"\nHer excuse might have sounded like the strangest casual conversation topic, and she expected questions and disbelief from Glenn. However, he simply accepted it with a nod and said, \"I see.\"\nMonica couldn't help but find Glenn's simplicity exasperating. But it was precisely this simplicity that saved her from the predicament she had created. She breathed a sigh of relief.\n\"And, um, about learning tracking spells… Mr. Gideon Rutherford has written some very easy-to-understand books on that topic… Lord Cyril mentioned that too… in casual conversation!\"\n\"Really! Then I'll check out those books right away!\"\nAs Glenn stood up from his chair and looked down at Monica, he scratched his head, appearing slightly embarrassed.\n\"Monica, thank you. I was getting a bit impatient… I almost took the wrong next step.\"\n\"…?\"\n\"I recently saw this amazing person called the ‘Silent Witch,' and I just jumped into things without thinking. Magic requires patiently and diligently building your foundation, right? Yeah.\"\nHis last words sounded like a self-reminder.\nMonica smiled softly and fidgeted with her fingers, making a quiet suggestion.\n\"Um, well… I don't know anything about magic at all, but since magic formulas are similar to mathematical equations, I think I could help a little with explanations…\"\nShe was fully aware of the risks she was taking by offering assistance while concealing her true identity.\nStill, Monica wanted to be of any help she could, even if it was just a tiny bit, to Glenn. She felt a sense of responsibility for not being able to help him during the cursed dragon incident. But more than that, she genuinely wanted to support this earnest young aspiring magician's growth.\n\"That would be great! Thanks, Monica!\"\n\"It's fine, hehe…\"\nSeeing Glenn's happy smile, Monica couldn't help but join in with a shy chuckle.\nWatching Monica and Glenn's interaction from the shadows, there was a young boy wearing the uniform of the intermediate division. He muttered to himself, \"Hmm, hmm,\" as he diligently scribbled notes in his notebook.\nAh, that's Lady Monica Norton and Lord Glenn Dudley, Lord Felix's favorite, right? Okay, okay, I should report this to Lord Albert right away.\nWith these thoughts in his mind, he casually left the library with unhurried steps.",

      "content": "In a dormitory room, Albert Frau Robelia Ridill, the third prince of the Ridill Kingdom, sat elegantly on a sofa, sipping tea. The Serendia Academy dorm was more spacious and better furnished than the one he had at Minerva. Albert couldn't help but feel the influence of Duke Crockford in the finer details, souring his mood.\n\"So, Patrick, what are the results of the investigation? Have you found any weaknesses in my elder brother Felix?\"\nPatrick, seated opposite Albert, nonchalantly nibbled on tea sweets, taking out a notebook as he mumbled.\n\"*nom* here's *nom* the report.\"\n\"Stop talking with crumbs falling everywhere, it's unsightly!\"\n\"Sure.\"\n\"Oh, come on! Wipe your mouth first!\"\nAlbert scolded the laid-back Patrick, who, despite being a servant, wiped his mouth with a handkerchief, sipped tea, and let out a satisfied sigh.\n\"The tea you chose, Your Highness, is delicious.\"\n\"Of course, it's my carefully selected blend… but never mind that! Where's the report! Have you found my brother's weakness?\"\n\"Oh, yes.\"\nWhile giving a tension-free reply, Patrick flipped through the pages of his notebook.\n\"First of all, regarding His Highness Felix's reputation…\"\n\"Skip the positive parts. Tell me about the negative aspects.\"\n\"The thing is… Nobody would say anything negative or reveal his weakness. After all, we are at the academy where Duke Crockford's influence is in power.\"\nAlbert grumbled. Patrick continued, casually turning the pages.\n\"As a matter of fact, he excels academically, always ranking at the top in both theoretical and practical subjects like swordsmanship and equestrian. His achievements as the student council president are also noteworthy. He is well-mannered, amiable, and there's really nothing to criticize.\"\nIndeed, compared to his half-brother Lionel and his other brother, Felix was a slender and elegant young nobleman. However, unlike his appearance, he excelled in swordsmanship.\nInitially, Albert suspected that Felix enjoyed preferential treatment from the instructor, yet witnessing Felix's mastery of the sword during training dispelled any doubts about his genuine prowess.\nFelix's standing in social circles was equally impressive; he navigated interactions flawlessly, even with obstinate old nobles, employing a persuasive and diplomatic approach that yielded notable successes, including recent triumphs in trade negotiations with the Falforia Kingdom.\nEven from Albert's biased perspective, it proved challenging to pinpoint specific reasons for his resentment toward Felix. Nevertheless, a disconcerting absence of human warmth left an unsettling impression, rendering Felix somewhat eerie even in the eyes of his half-brothers like Albert and even the king.\n\"Any word on Felix's romantic entanglements? Any scandal involving a lady from here or there?\"\n\"Hmm, everyone around is saying that it's either Miss Eliane Hyatt, the daughter of Duke Reinberg, or Miss Bridget Graham, the daughter of Marquis Sheilbury, might be the potential fiancée candidate…. but the situation in that regard remains unclear.\"\nFelix initiated a dance with Eliane at the festival's evening party, and during the winter break, he ventured into the Duchy of Reinberg. From this, it appears that Eliane holds a slight advantage. Despite these events, no official engagement announcement has been made.\n\"Miss Eliane seems to be a suitable match for my brother—indeed.\"\n\"It seems Your Highness has a preference for Miss Bridget.\"\n\"Fool, Patrick! One shouldn't speak aloud what others hold in their hearts!\"\nAlbert scolded, his cheeks flushing white, and snapped back to reality, awkwardly clearing his throat.\n\"Ahem… Regarding the matter occupying my thoughts, let us keep it between us for now. Promise me, will you? Absolutely no divulging, all right? Mum's the word?\"\n\"I won't breathe a syllable~\"\nAs Albert covertly contemplates whether the laid-back tone of his servant is truly fitting, Patrick nonchalantly flips through his notebook and interjects, \"Oh, by the way~.\"\n\"It appears that His Highness Felix has two favored students ~\"\n\"Oh?\"\n\"The first is Glenn Dudley, a second-year student in the advanced class and a disciple of the Seven Sages—Lord Barrier Magician. When His Highness Felix visited the Duchy of Reinberg, Glenn accompanied him as a guard~\"\nAt the mere mention of Glenn's name by Patrick, Albert's eyes gleamed, prompting him to rise from his seat.\n\"I recognize that name! He portrayed the hero Ralph at the school festival!\"\n\"It appears that even the role of Ralph was handpicked by His Highness Felix, you see~\"\nDuring the school festival, Albert wasn't yet a student at Serendia Academy, but his mother insisted he attend.\nSince then, it had been decided that Albert would leave Minerva and transfer to Serendia Academy.\n\"My adorable Albert, from now on, you will attend Serendia Academy.\"\nAlbert, reluctantly attending Serendia Academy's festival as instructed by his mother, found his attention unexpectedly captivated by the stage.\nThe tale of the hero Ralph started as a mundane and boring performance, but in the latter half, with the change of the protagonist, an overwhelming production unfolded. Amidst explosions, flights through the sky using magic, and the heroic rescue of the heroine Amelia, Albert couldn't contain his excitement.\nWhile an honor student at Minerva with decent magical abilities, Albert struggled with flight magic and couldn't master it. Watching Glenn Dudley freely soar through the sky struck Albert as immensely cool, akin to a genuine hero like Ralph.\n\"That's unfair, elder brother! It's unjust to have someone as amazing as Senior Dudley as a servant!\"\nCertainly, Felix seemed to have strategic foresight in choosing Glenn Dudley as his close aide. Ah, what a cunning brother! He was already eyeing a potential candidate for the Seven Sages.\nAs Albert expressed his frustration, Patrick continued the report, casually munching on cookies.\n\"Oh, and one more thing. It seems that His Highness Felix refers to a certain female student as ‘Little Squirrel' and treats her like a pet~\"\n\"W-What!? Treating a female student as a p-p-pet!?\"\n\"Yes~. When we asked the female students, we received testimonies like these~\"\nSaying so, Patrick opened a page with multiple testimonials from female students.\n\"Ah, that girl. She appears to have piqued His Highness Felix's interest, but it certainly feels almost like doting on a pet.\"\n\"Yeah, yeah. A young girl like her is suitable as a pet for the student council.\"\n\"As a woman and a student council member, there's no way she could be acknowledged. She's rather shabby. His Highness, being kind, took pity on a stray dog and decided to keep her in the student council.\"\n(Rest ommited…)\nAlbert, forgetting that his servant was devouring cookies, was struck with shock.\n\"This is inhumane! Is such a thing allowed!?\"\n\"Well, the rumored ‘Little Squirrel' Monica Norton is the student council treasurer, a second-year student in the advanced class. She was taken in as an adopted daughter by the wife of the former Count Kerbeck from a monastery. She seems to be the attendant to Isabelle Norton, the daughter of the current head family.\"\n\"The House of Count Kerbeck? Aren't they a major noble family in the eastern region!\"\nThe House of Count Kerbeck, governing a vast area in the eastern region, is a powerful aristocracy with a brave and formidable army. Their military strength is said to rival even the kingdom's dragon knight order.\n\"For my brother to treat the adopted daughter of such a major noble family as a p-p-pet…\"\n\"Miss Monica Norton is mistreated by the Kerbeck, and she is bullied by the daughter, Isabelle. There have been testimonies that she's scolded and ridiculed by Isabelle even within the academy.\"\n\"H-How pitiful… mistreated by the Kerbeck and then treated as a pet by my brother…\"\nAlbert, with a pale face, hung his head for a moment but eventually raised his eyebrows sharply and, with a loud voice, declared.\n\"All right, I've decided, Patrick. I will win over both Glenn Dudley and Miss Monica Norton and bring them into our camp!\"\nPerhaps Glenn Dudley and Monica Norton know the weaknesses of Felix, who rarely shows vulnerability to others. Even if he couldn't obtain the desired information, if he could bring Felix's favored students into his own camp… surely, he could make that brother of his feel regret.\nIn front of Albert, burning with ambition, the laid-back servant, unfazed, casually savored the last cookie.",

      "content": "The recent tasks of the student council have been relatively light. The upcoming busy period is slated for two months from now, during the general student assembly, so the days leading up to it have been rather laid-back. Presently, only Felix and Monica occupy the student council room.\nHaving grown accustomed to the tasks, Monica efficiently organizes some documents, leaving almost no outstanding work in a short span.\nWith today's tasks completed, Monica has quietly made plans to visit the library. Lately, she spent her free time there, assisting Glenn with his studies.\nMonica harbored a deep-seated desire to assist Glenn as a friend, and her longstanding curiosity about tracking spell formula fueled her determination. While elucidating the intricacies of the spell formula to Glenn, she multitasked by delving into the analysis of its components. Even as she methodically organized accounting notes, her mind remained immersed in the ongoing creation of the tracking spell formula.\nWith a duration of approximately two seconds, the tracking spell formula synchronizes with the time it takes for an attack magic to reach an opponent at an average speed and distance. Yet, by extending this duration, the spell could become significantly more versatile…\n\"Monica.\"\nTo achieve this, precise target recognition and a delicate balance in spell formula duration are important… Establishing the effective range of the tracking spell formula is the first step, followed by a meticulous evaluation of tracking performance improvements within that range…\n\"Ahh.\"\nEngrossed in her thoughts about the spell, Monica felt a gentle touch on her lips. A subtle aroma of butter and raisins wafted through the air, teasing her senses.\nSetting the effective range to an intermediate magic first-class range… The delightful flavor of raisins and the enticing scent of butter… Calculations based on range and coordinates… Raisins are truly delicious…\nOnce Monica started eating something, her natural tendency was to become completely absorbed in the experience. Midway through her indulgence, while savoring each bite, she found herself deeply engrossed in the enjoyment of the baked goods. The buttery cake dough, expertly blended with an abundance of raisins, proved to be a delectable treat.\nIn this manner, as she swallowed a mouthful of the baked delight with satisfaction, Monica finally snapped back to reality.\n\"Huh!?\"\nWide-eyed, she discovered Felix's well-kept, sweet face right in front of her.\nFelix was seated opposite Monica, leaning on his hand, and regarding her with an amused expression. It appeared that he had fed a piece of the pastry to Monica.\nIf Cyril were present, he'd likely be exclaiming, ‘Ignoring His Highness when he addresses you, what audacity!'\n\"Y-Y-Your… Your Highness…\"\n\"Today, you seem getting so focused on your work. Would you like another one?\"\nWith these words, Felix extended another pastry toward Monica. She hesitated briefly, debating whether to reach out with her right or left hand and ultimately accepted it with both hands, a tad timidly.\nIn front of Felix, Monica aimed to conduct herself in a manner that concealed the injury on her left hand as much as possible.\n\"Th-thank you very much.\"\n\"It seemed like you were pondering something quite seriously. Is there something on your mind?\"\nThe contents of her thoughts revolved around the new spell formula, and Felix was intricately connected to most of Monica's concerns.\nMonica finds herself at a loss when it comes to interacting with Felix. He is entwined with Duke Crockford, a key figure in the events surrounding Monica's father's demise. Whispers circulating among those in the know labeled Felix as the \"Puppet Prince.\" He refrained from opposing Duke Crockford, to be exact, he was unable to defy him.\nNevertheless, the sporadic glimpses of \"Eig\" that he displayed left Monica perplexed.\nIn the red-light district, he expressed his fascination with magic and playfully referred to Monica as a nightlife friend. Subsequently, he gave her books and a necklace.\nDuring the ball, he urged Monica to \"find something you can be passionate about for yourself.\"\nIn the Duchy of Reinberg, he revealed a childlike visage, brimming with excitement, as he presented his paper to the \"Silent Witch.\"\n… It feels like I'm conversing with two distinct individuals, \"His Highness\" and \"Eig\"…\nThere's the flawless prince, \"His Highness,\" adept at concealing everything behind a beautiful smile and adhering to the expectations of those around him. Then there's \"Eig,\" the magic enthusiast, an ardent admirer of the \"Silent Witch,\" who seems to be giving up on something. As these two personas interchanged, Monica grappled with uncertainty about how to approach Felix.\n\"Are you feeling uneasy about the budget meeting?\"\n\"Uh, well, a bit, yes.\"\n\"Don't worry; we'll offer support from our side too. If a persistent club leader is causing you trouble, just let me know. We'll take appropriate measures on our end.\"\nThe playful grin accompanying Felix's act of sweetly feeding Monica hints at the mischievous \"Eig,\" while the composed demeanor suggesting actions against the club leader aligns with \"His Highness.\"\n\"Oh, and one more thing.\"\nFelix slightly narrowed his blue eyes, and the smile on his lips acquired a subtle touch of coolness.\n\"I've heard that transfer student Roberto Vinkel has been bothering you every day. If he becomes too much of a nuisance, I can offer a suggestion to his teacher.\"\n\"N-no, it's okay.\"\nAs Monica shook her head, Felix let out a chuckle.\nThe blue eyes caught the light streaming in through the window, gleaming like dew-kissed jewels.\n\"Shall I speak my mind? … I want you to seek help from me.\"\nMonica clenched her free right hand into a fist, assuming a posture that radiates strength in her own way. With a resolute expression, she declared, \"I can't burden His Highness with my troubles!\"\n\"…………I see.\"\nAs his long, golden eyelashes slightly lowered, Felix's blue eyes cast shadows.\n——Which persona is this, \"His Highness\" or \"Eig\"?\nContemplating this in the recesses of her thoughts, Monica rose to her feet.\n\"I-I've completed today's tasks, so I'll take my leave.\"\nWith those words, Monica organized her writing materials, and once again, Felix quietly observed her with serene eyes.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"I've spotted the target. Patrick, take your position.\"\n\"Since when did we decide our positions~?\"\n\"Pretend to be choosing a book and hide in the shadow of a nice-looking bookshelf.\"\n\"Alright, in a nice-looking~\"\nRepeating the instructions in a laid-back tone, Patrick smoothly retreated into the shadows of a nearby bookshelf.\nConfirming that, Albert feigned interest in choosing a book from the shelf while casting a sidelong glance at the target—Glenn Dudley and Monica Norton—standing a bit away.\nAs Patrick had investigated, the target had been consistently studying together in the library over the past few days.\nThe library building at Serendia Academy served both the middle and high school sections, offering an excellent opportunity for Albert, a middle school student, to naturally approach the target.\nAlright, here I go.\nWith an impressively natural gait that anyone would find convincing, Albert approached the target. As he passed by, he deliberately let a handkerchief fall from his pocket.\nPretending not to notice, Albert stopped near a bookshelf, simulating a search for books.\nCasting a furtive glance, Monica Norton seemed to have caught sight of the handkerchief. She picked it up and looked alternately between Albert and the handkerchief, appearing a bit flustered.\nGood, good, it's working. Now, come on, talk to me.\nAlbert waited for Monica to initiate the conversation, but she hesitated to do so. A sidelong glance revealed she was still holding the handkerchief, looking uneasy.\nWhat's wrong? Come talk to me. Is she perhaps feeling intimidated because I'm royalty?\nAs Albert had anticipated, Monica was indeed feeling quite intimidated at that moment.\nTh-th-that person, he's definitely the third prince…!? I saw him at the New Year's ceremony—no doubt about it… The width of his eyes, the length of his nose, the angle of his chin, they all match perfectly… W-w-what should I do? Has he realized that I'm the \"Silent Witch\"? Ahhhh, I picked up his handkerchief, but what should I do? Would it be disrespectful if I approached him? I-I hope he realizes his handkerchief is over here, and just looks over here, even a little bit…!!\nCome on, just hand over the handkerchief already. This is a perfect opportunity to talk to me, a royal. Come over here and talk to me…! T-A-L-K-T-O-M-E!!\nI hope he notices me from over there, just notices it already…!\nHurry up and talk to me! This plan isn't progressing at all!\nWhile the two were lost in their thoughts, Glenn glanced at Monica and spoke.\n\"What's with that handkerchief?\"\n\"Ah, uhh, th-th-that, it was, dropped by, um, over there.\"\nMonica stammered, and as she did, Glenn swiftly picked up the handkerchief from Monica's hand and walked confidently toward Albert.\n\"Hey, you dropped your handkerchief.\"\nGreat!\nThough he almost blurted it out loud, Albert turned around with a natural demeanor.\n\"Oh, without a doubt, this is my handkerchief! It's a precious one I received from my mother! Thank you over there for picking it up. I sincerely appreciate it!\"\nPatrick, hidden in the shadows, couldn't help but smirk at the somewhat unnatural delivery of Albert's lines. But Albert, praising his own acting skills, continued with the prepared lines.\n\"As a token of gratitude, I'd like to invite you both to a tea party. Will you accept?\"\n\"It's a bit much just for picking up a handkerchief. Don't you think so, Monica?\"\nMonica, with sweat breaking out all over her face, vigorously nodded in agreement. However, Albert couldn't back down at this point.\n\"No, that won't do! To show ingratitude to a benefactor, I, Albert Frau Robelia Ridill, the third prince of the Kingdom of Ridill, cannot allow it!\"\nMentioning his royal status, Albert widened his eyes dramatically, and Glenn, taken aback, stared at Albert's face.\n\"The third prince… Could it be… the younger brother of the club president?\"\n\"Indeed, I am the younger brother of that student council president, Felix Ark Ridill.\"\n\"Oh, really? We're always grateful to the president.\"\nWith a sly smile and in a manner as if he had just recognized Glenn's face, Albert theatrically raised his voice.\n\"Oh, upon closer inspection, aren't you Glenn Dudley, who played the role of Ralph at the school festival? That performance was truly splendid. I've been wanting to talk to you. And if she doesn't mind, I'd like to invite the lady over there too.\"\n\"Well, we're in the middle of studying right now…\"\nNo, this won't do; it's not getting anywhere like this.\nHaving lost his patient, Albert clapped his hands together and raised his voice.\n\"Patrick! Patrick!\"\n\"Prince Albert~. You shouldn't speak so loudly in the library~.\"\nSuppressing the urge to yell, \"That's not the line how we rehearsed it,\" Albert commanded with an imperious look on his face.\n\"Swiftly, make preparations for the upcoming tea party and ensure the guests are accompanied!\"\n\"Alrighty~. I must apologize to both of you. You see, Prince Albert isn't accustomed to extending invitations, as he doesn't have many friends to invite to tea parties.\"\nWhere did the rehearsed line disappear?\nAlbert couldn't help but feel a vein throbbing on his forehead. However, in response to Patrick's explanation, Glenn and Monica nodded empathetically, expressing sentiments like, \"If that's the case,\" and \"Well, just for a little…\"\nThis is odd. Originally, he would extend a more refined invitation to the two guests for the tea party. Why did it end up sounding like a plea from someone lacking in friends?\nFeeling dissatisfied, Albert consoled himself, acknowledging that at least the initial phase of the plan had been successful.",

      "content": "The tea room that Albert led them to boasted the most exquisite private room within the junior division tea room.\nThe tea table was adorned with beautiful flowers, and delicate, gold-patterned dishes against a white backdrop showcased an array of delectable sweets, meticulously arranged. Amidst the tempting assortment, the cream-covered pie stood out as particularly eye-catching.\nWhile the term \"pie\" often conjures images of thin crusts adorned with jam or fruit, a cream pie was a rarity. Butter and granulated sugar alone held a certain luxury, but the addition of fresh cream elevated it to a level seldom experienced by the common folk.\n\"Please, take a seat,\" urged Albert, as Monica and Glenn gracefully settled into their chairs.\nMonica, battling a churn in her stomach, fought to maintain a composed expression.\nDoes Prince Albert suspect my identity as the Silent Witch? Has he noticed? He couldn't have, right? Right?!?\nMeanwhile, Albert, praising his own cleverness for guiding them this far, pondered his next move.\nSo far, things have gone according to plan! Now, my negotiation skills will truly be put to the test. I'm determined to win over these two favorites of my older brother, Felix!\nGlenn and Patrick couldn't take their eyes off the enticing cream pie.\nLooks delicious!\nWow, that looks so tasty!\nAmidst the intertwining expectations, Albert's hosted tea gathering began.\nThe first to break the silence was Glenn.\n\"Let's dig in!\"\nMonica, having received lessons in tea gatherings, possessed a basic understanding of etiquette. However, it was only natural to assume that Glenn, being the son of a butcher, had no such knowledge of refined manners.\nDisregarding etiquette entirely, Glenn seized the cream pie and eagerly devoured it.\n\"It tastes incredibly good!\"\nSeeing Glenn with cream smeared all over his mouth, Monica couldn't help but worry that he might incur Albert's displeasure.\nHowever, Albert seemed more delighted that his treats were being enjoyed than concerned about Glenn's breach of etiquette. Sipping his tea with a somewhat proud expression, he appeared to relish the moment.\n\"Monica, this is really delicious!\"\n\"Uh, well, I, um…\"\nConcerned about proper etiquette, Monica hesitated, considering whether it would be more appropriate to wait for Albert, the highest-ranking person present, to begin eating. She observed as Albert directed his attention to Patrick, his young attendant. Patrick, with a beaming smile, generously scooped the largest portion of pie onto a plate and eagerly gripped a fork.\n\"Yay, let's dig in!\"\n\"Idiot, I didn't gave you a sign for that! Fetch pastries for Miss Norton!\"\n\"Oh, right!\"\nCunningly, Patrick managed to keep his own plate while also serving a portion of the pie onto Monica's plate.\nAlbert smiled softly, adopting a condescending demeanor befitting his royal status as he looked at Monica.\n\"Now, go ahead and eat, Miss Norton. I presume the Count Kerbeck household haven't provided you decent meals.\"\n\"N-no, it's not like that…\"\nNervously, Monica shook her head, her demeanor seemingly conveying consideration for the Count Kerbeck household, at least in Albert's perception.\nAlbert displayed a somewhat sympathetic expression.\n\"No need to be reserved, I've heard the rumors. It seems the Count Kerbeck household mistreats you, and as for my brother… in the student council room, he treats you like a… like a pet, doesn't he?\"\n\"…A pet!?\"\nLeft speechless, Monica listened as Albert, somewhat embarrassed, muttered quickly.\n\"I never thought my brother had such a perverse taste, treating a woman like a pet with a collar. I'm sure he's imposing shameful and indecent things on you, things I can't even imagine. No, I don't need to hear all the details. I'm not a man lacking in delicacy to make a woman speak about such things. Yeah. But if it's tough for you, you can honestly say it's tough.\"\n\"Um, well…?\"\nIt was unclear exactly what Albert was imagining, but it appeared he was leaping to various conclusions.\nBesides Albert, who had dropped the bombshell statement, and a stunned Monica, Glenn, and Patrick were leisurely nibbling on their pies.\n\"This pie, you see, gets even more delicious when you generously spread this raspberry jam on it!\"\n\"The balance between sweetness and sourness is exquisite!\"\n\"Yes, you can eat as much as you want. Oh, would you like a refill of tea?\"\nAt that moment, it was a world of tranquility. Monica found herself yearning to join that peaceful realm.\n…However, she couldn't just leave Albert's misunderstanding unaddressed.\n\"Um, I-I'm not a pet or anything, I mean… I am… I am…\"\nAs Monica attempted to speak, she stumbled over her words.\nMonica was still grappling with the shocking statement she had received in the entertainment district: ‘I thought of you as an interesting pet.'\nBut, I've already graduated from being called Little Squirrel… Now, things are different, right? Huh, but then… What am I to His Highness?\nFor Felix, the Silent Witch was a lady he admired and respected. So, what was Monica Norton to Felix?\nMonica, who was not adept at objectively assessing how others perceived her, struggled to navigate the situation. Nevertheless, she had to get through this moment somehow, and Monica desperately tried to rummage her brain. She had already graduated from being a Little Squirrel, and now he called her by her name. That should mean she was no longer considered a pet. However, Monica couldn't shake the feeling that Felix still found her amusing and played with her. In other words, what Monica Norton meant to Felix was…\n\"I am… His Highness's… toy?\"\nWhen Monica blurted out the word that came to her mind, it seemed to place her in a position even lower than being a pet.\nAlbert cast a pitying glance at Monica.\n\"Miss Norton, why don't you stop serving my brother and come under my protection? If you do, I'll guarantee you a life with three meals a day, plus snacks.\"\nNow Felix seemed to be painted as a villain because of her words. At this point, Monica didn't care how she appeared, she had to somehow support Felix. However, the more she tried to defend Felix, the more she felt like she was digging herself into a hole.\nAs Monica stammered, \"Um, well…\" Glenn, having finished his tea in one go, interjected.\n\"The student council president is a good guy! Not a bad person!\"\n\"B-but, according to the rumors…\"\nAs Albert insisted, Glenn, with cream still all over his mouth, made a serious expression.\n\"I don't really get the rumors, but from what I see when looking at the president, I can tell he's a good person.\"\nWhat a pleasant thing to say.\nMonica lowered her head and quietly chuckled at herself.\n…If only I could confidently say that His Highness is a good person, just like Glenn does.\nHowever, Monica couldn't shake the image of Duke Crockford from her mind, and the fear of trusting kept her hesitant.\nIn response to Glenn's sincere words, Albert, for some reason, had a frustrated expression as he bent his mouth into a pout, hanging his head down. Deep wrinkles formed between his young eyebrows.\n\"…It's always like this. Everyone always sides with my brother.\"\nHis muttered words were a far cry from the arrogance he displayed earlier. It sounded more like a sulking child. In front of the sulking Albert, Patrick placed a plate of pie.\n\"Prince Albert~. When you're feeling down, sweet treats are the best~.\"\n\"I'm not feeling down at all!\"\n\"Let's put plenty of raspberry jam on it~.\"\n\"I more prefer apricot jam!\"\nAlbert, still pouting and displaying a hint of anger, seemed to have regained a bit of his energy.\nGlenn, licking the cream around his mouth, said to him, \"In other words, Albert, you want to be friends with Monica, right?\"\n\"Well, I think that's probably not it…\"\nIgnoring Monica's softly muttered retort, Glenn cheerfully slapped his chest.\n\"Then it's settled! Since we eat something delicious together, we're already become friends! Me, Monica, Albert, and Patrick, we're all friends!\"\nWhile Patrick casually said, \"It's an honor,\" in response to Glenn's overly positive words, Monica was not in the mood for such things.\nIf you said something disrespectful to royalty like this, wouldn't it be considered a crime of disrespect? As Monica sweated nervously, Albert muttered quietly, \"…friends,\" and then looked at Monica as if seeking confirmation.\n\"Miss Norton, let me confirm. you are not ‘friends' with my brother Felix, correct?\"\n\"Um, well, Prince Felix is my senior, so it would be too presumptuous of me to say we're friends…\"\n\"I see, so you're not friends? But if I become your friend… yeah, yeah, my brother might get frustrated about this…\"\nThe last part was spoken in a nearly inaudible whisper. However, Albert seemed to be satisfied with something, nodding elegantly as he took a sip of his tea.\n\"I see, we're friends. Yes, friends. If that's the case, I don't mind inviting you to tea parties like this in the future. After all, we're friends.\"\n\"That's great, Prince Albert~.\"\n\"Hehe, I'm in a good mood now, so feel free to eat more pie, Patrick.\"\n\"Oh, I'm sorry, Prince Albert. I already ate all of it~.\"\n\"You didn't leave me any!?\"\nAs Albert protested loudly and Patrick remained unfazed, Glenn smiled and said, \"You guys seem to get along well.\"\nPhew… for now, it seems like my true identity hasn't been exposed… I hope?\nMonica sighed in relief and took a small bite of the untouched pie.",

      "content": "It has been three weeks since the new semester started.\nSo far, Monica has been able to live her days as Monica Norton without being exposed by Felix, and without encountering Hubert Dee, the man who has a rivalry against her.\nSometimes Robert would barge into the classroom and suddenly read a poem (?) or invite her to play chess, but other than that, it was mostly peaceful.\nThe student council work was not busy yet, and her left hand was also getting better. She still had a weak grip and it hurt when she put some force on it, but she could open and close it lightly, much more naturally than before.\nThe only change that happened recently was that Albert joined the study sessions with Glenn after class.\nAlbert, who had been attending Minerva until a while ago, had some knowledge of magic. He hit it off with Glenn and they started studying magic together.\nAlbert was good at understanding magic formulas, but bad at manipulating magic with his senses. That's why he benefited from studying with Glenn, who was the opposite type.\nLately, Glenn was teaching Albert how to cast a flying spell, and Albert was teaching Glenn how to cast a tracking spell. After studying together like that, they would sometimes have tea at Albert's place.\nMonica had been able to spend her days as Monica Norton without being exposed for these three weeks, and she was a little bit… yes, just a little bit careless.\nEven though none of the problems she faced had been solved.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nIt was the day of the student council meeting, but there was some time left until the third-year classes ended, so Monica decided to have tea with Lana, who invited her to a later time. It would have been nice to enjoy a tea party in the courtyard on a sunny day, but today it was snowing from the gray sky. So, they decided to have a tea party in the indoor tea salon.\nIt was a small tea party with only three participants: Lana, Claudia, and Monica. Lana prepared the tea cakes, and Monica prepared the coffee. The warm coffee with plenty of milk was what Lana had requested. It was honestly nice to have a friend like what she liked.\nLana took a sip of the coffee and sighed.\n\"I really like Monica's coffee. Monica, why don't you open a coffee shop? This coffee would definitely be popular in the royal capital.\"\n\"Ehehe, r-really…\"\nMonica blushed and Claudia said quietly with a coffee cup in her hand.\n\"…You should take good care of that pot. The rubber at the joint is a special rubber from overseas… It's not easy to replace.\"\nThe coffee pot, which was her father's legacy, was divided into upper and lower parts, water was put in the lower pot, ground beans were set in the funnel, and the upper pot was set and heated. The rubber was used at the joint between the upper and lower parts.\nThe rubber, which was heat-resistant and durable, was an important part that maintained the airtightness of the pot. According to Claudia, it was not something that could be easily replaced even if it deteriorated.\nBut Lana argued against Claudia's words.\n\"Oh, I think you can get it in Southern Doll. Recently, the import volume of high-quality rubber has increased. There is a lot of demand because of the various mechanization that is going on.\"\n\"…It's not cheap, is it?\"\n\"Uh, w-well, that's true, but…\"\nLana sipped her coffee as if to cover up and continued, \"Speaking of Southern Doll…\"\n\"The merchants there seem to be flowing to the empire. And the new emperor who likes new things, has lowered the taxes and given preferential treatment to the merchants.\"\n\"…Because of the lower taxes, they are having trouble with our foreign affairs department, I hear.\"\n\"Yes, yes. And to compete with the empire, Southern Doll's side also wants to start a new business. My father seems to be planning to invest in it.\"\nMonica didn't really get the point of the conversation, so she quietly sipped her coffee and Lana looked at Monica and said.\n\"Hey, Monica. Have you thought about what you're going to do after graduation?\"\n\"……Huh?\"\nMonica was surprised by the unexpected question.\nMonica and the others were currently in their second year of the senior division. There was still more than a year left until graduation.\nBut even without that, Monica had never thought about what she would do after graduation.\nMonica was at this academy to protect Felix──in other words, her mission would end when Felix graduated this year, and Monica would return to the life of the Seven Sages as the Silent Witch.\nMonica realized that again felt a chill in her heart, and smiled awkwardly.\n\"Um… yeah, I haven't… thought of anything… yet.\"\n\"I'm planning to help my father with his work after graduation. I'm thinking of setting up a new trading company based in Southern Doll.\"\nIt was not an easy thing for a young woman to become a trading company president. But with Lana's family's wealth, it would depend on Lana's ability.\nAccording to Lana, she wanted to deal with a new dye in Southern Doll and bring a new wind to the fashion industry. It was a plan that suited Lana, who loved trendy and fashionable things.\nMonica nodded as she listened to Lana's business plan, and Lana cut off her words and looked at Monica.\n\"After you graduate, won't you help me with my work?\"\n\"……Eh?\"\nMonica exclaimed in surprise, and Lana twirled her hair around her finger and pursed her lips.\n\"You're good at numbers, right? That's why I want to entrust you with the accounting work. I-I'm not saying that I'm favoring you or giving you preferential treatment because you're my friend.\"\nLana spoke quickly, and Claudia said quietly.\n\"…Surely, as a student council member of Serendia Academy… and moreover, a member of the same generation where the second prince was the president… that alone would guarantee trust from the noble trading partners.\"\nApparently, the influence of the Serendia Academy student council was greater than Monica had thought.\nAccording to Claudia, there were many Serendia Academy student council members among the bureaucrats and ministers who worked at the palace.\nMonica understood the reason why the student council members were admired, and Lana muttered softly.\n\"That's right. Being a student council member of Serendia Academy is a great advantage… And besides, I feel more confident if I work with you, Monica…\"\nMonica's heart jumped at those words.\nLana relied on Monica. She said she felt more confident if she worked with Monica. She needed her.\n…I'm so happy.\nBut at the same time, a guilt that stabbed her chest welled up.\n──Monica would leave the academy in half a year. She wouldn't even have a graduation ceremony with Lana.\n\"Well, it's still more than a year away, so take your time and think about it. If you need the approval of the Kerbeck Count's family, I'll help you persuade them.\"\nLana seemed to think that the reason Monica was stiffening her face was because she was worried about the Kerbeck Count's family.\nMonica smiled vaguely and nodded slightly.\nSince she knew she couldn't accept Lana's offer.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nIt was time for the student council meeting, so Monica left Lana and Claudia behind and left the tea salon first. And then, she headed to the student council room with a somewhat fluffy feeling.\nWhat occupied Monica's mind was Lana's proposal.\nTo start a trading company with Lana in Southern Doll… Monica honestly thought that it sounded \"fun\".\nLana, who was sensitive to trends and surprisingly solid, would surely succeed in business. If she could support her from behind, she would surely have a fulfilling life. But Monica Norton was a person who didn't exist in the first place… If Monica's identity was exposed, Lana would surely leave Monica. Helping Lana with her work was an impossible future. Still, Monica closed her eyes to the reality around her for a little while and indulged in fantasy.\nThat's why her vigilance to the surroundings became lax.\nShe would normally check for people's presence when turning a corner, but Monica neglected to do that this time. When she turned the corner, someone walking from the front stopped and stared at Monica, and shaped his lips into a crescent smile. Monica, who was indulging in fantasy, didn't notice that it was directed at her.\n\"……What are you doing here, Everett?\"\nThe Monica in the dream is not the Silent Witch Monica Everett, but Lana's friend Monica Norton. So even after hearing that brutish voice, Monica didn't immediately realize that it was directed at her.\nShe didn't realize that the man had called her Everett. She walked past him, and then a hand covered in rings dug into her shoulder.\n\"Hiiek!?\"\nBy the time she realized it, Monica was grabbed by the shoulder from behind, and her chin was grabbed by the other hand, pulling her closer. The fingertips that caught Monica's chin squeezed Monica's cheeks from left and right.\n\"Why are you ignoring me after not seeing you for a long time? You're cold, aren't you? Have you forgotten about me? …I'm sad, you know, I never forgot about you.\"\nMonica, who was grabbed by the chin from behind, couldn't turn around… but even if she heard that voice, she didn't doubt who was behind her.\n\"…S-Senior Dee…\"\nThe man who had once chased Monica around Minerva snorted happily and tilted her chin up to make her look at him. He had the same sharp eyes and the same burning red hair as in her memory.\nHe was the nephew of one of the Seven Sages, the Artillery Magician──Hubert Dee. He looked down at Monica with a smirk on his face.\nMonica trembled and looked around with only her eyes. Fortunately or unfortunately, there was no one around.\nMonica gathered all the courage she had in her and squeezed out her voice.\n\"I, I'm Monica Norton now. I have an important mission, and I'm hiding my identity… Please, please don't call me Everett.\"\nMonica, who had been abused by her uncle in the past, and who had been chased by Hubert at Minerva, had her memories mixed up and was in a panic. Tears were already welling up in the corners of her eyes, and her throat was shaking miserably with a hiccup.\nStill, the previous Monica would have screamed and run away from this place. Considering that, it was a big step to be able to ask him directly.\nHubert seemed to think about something and narrowed his eyes suddenly. His hand that was holding Monica's shoulder and chin didn't loosen.\n\"Hmm hmm hmm… If my uncle knew that you were on a mission at Serendia Academy, he would have told me not to interfere with your mission… If my uncle doesn't know, it means that only a few of the Seven Sages know, about a political issue… Speaking of which, it's convenient that the second prince is here, huh? …Hmm hmm, so, the mission is to protect or investigate the second prince?\"\nHubert looked rough, but he was very smart. He understood ten from one, and his thinking speed was as fast as when Monica was at Minerva.\n\"…Please, please don't tell anyone about me…\"\nMonica pleaded with a sob, and Hubbard looked at her like a rabbit caught in a trap.\n\"Please? Sure, I'll listen to you.\"\nMonica found a ray of hope in despair.\nAh, this senior, who didn't listen to me, has become a little softer over the years, she thought.\nWithout knowing that Hubbard was licking his lips above her head.\n\"But, there's a condition.\"\n\"……Huh?\"\n\"Right now, I belong to the \"Magic Duel Research Club\" at this academy. Do you get it? We do magic duels every day after class. You join there.\"\nMonica's ears turned pale as Hubert whispered lowly.\n\"Let's do it every day until we graduate… ma-gic-bat-tle.\"\n\"I, impossible, impossible, I can't use magic with my current status, and… I also have the student council's duty.\"\nStudent councils are prohibited from joining clubs or research groups. So Monica, as a member of the student council, couldn't accept that condition.\nBut Hubert told her mercilessly.\n\"Then, quit the student council.\"\n\"…N, no… I don't want to.\"\nMonica shook her head weakly, and Hubert's eyes sparkled.\n\"You said \"no\" instead of \"impossible\", right? That means you can continue your mission even if you quit the student council, right?\"\n\"……!!\"\nWhat Hubert said was right. It was true that being a student council member made it easier to protect Felix, but quitting the student council didn't mean that the mission would be impossible to continue.\nStill, Monica didn't want to quit the student council. She had finally gotten used to the job and was starting to get relied on.\n\"…Please, please, anything but that, please…\"\nMonica pleaded with a sob, and Hubert hummed… and suddenly lifted Monica over his shoulder.\nMonica gasped and flailed her arms and legs.\n\"L, let me go… let me go, please…!\"\n\"Then, let's go talk to the student council directly, shall we, Mo-ni-ka?\"\nIt was then that Monica finally understood.\nThis senior's habit of not listening to anyone hasn't changed a bit since then.",

      "content": "On the walkway outside the library building, Albert Flau Robelia Ridill, the third prince of the Ridill Kingdom, was standing on one leg.\n\"Is this really how you learn flying magic, Senior Dudley?\"\n\"The most important thing in flying magic is balance sense! I want you to cross the walkway straight on one leg first.\"\nDudley said confidently to Albert, who had a doubtful look on his face.\nNext to Albert, Patrick, who had no plans to learn flying magic, was hopping around on one leg with a smile.\n\"Prince Albert~, let's compete~\"\n\"Hmm, that's what I want! Hop!\"\nThe two boys hopped across the walkway… but Albert stumbled and fell on his butt after just a few steps.\nPatrick, who had gone a little ahead, looked back at Albert on one leg.\n\"Prince Albert~, are you okay~?\"\n\"Damn it, Patrick! How dare you go ahead of your master!\"\nAlbert shouted and Patrick tilted his head and looked at the senior division building instead of Albert.\n\"You're looking away while your master is talking! How dare you!\"\n\"Umm~, there seems to be some ruckus in the senior division building~…\"\nAs he said, there seems to be some ruckus on the senior division side. As he looked, Albert found a tall redhead boy and a petite girl on his shoulder in the window of the first-floor corridor of the senior division building.\n\"What's that…\"\nIt was Monica Norton who was carried like a hunting prey.\n\"…What's going on…\"\nMonica seemed to be desperately resisting, but the boy didn't seem to care and went up the stairs in a good mood.\nAt that sight, Glenn groaned in a low voice.\n\"……It's him…!!\"\nGlenn groaned in a low voice unlike his usual cheerful self, and ran toward the school building.\nAlbert was stunned for a moment, but came to his senses and called out to Patrick.\n\"Patrick! We're going after them too!\"\n\"On one leg~?\"\n\"Run normally!\"\n\"You can't run in the hallway~\"\nIn the end, the two of them barely ran in a fast walk, following Glenn.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nIn the student council room, Cyril Ashley was irritated as he looked at the clock on the pillar. It was already time for the student council meeting, but Monica was nowhere to be seen.\n\"…What is Treasurer Norton doing?\"\n\"Well, she should know that there is a student council meeting today.\"\nNeil muttered in a troubled tone, and Elliott urged him to start first.\nWhen Bridget, who was silent, looked at Felix's words as if to guess, Felix looked at the door and said, \"Oh?\"\n\"…I seem to hear something.\"\nWhen he listened carefully, he heard someone's scream. Cyril knew that shameful childlike cry well. It was the voice of his junior Monica Norton.\n\"She came at last… What is she making a fuss about?\"\nMonica, who was timid and like a small animal, often screamed strangely every time she was surprised or tripped. But today, the scream was unusually long.\nMonica's scream gradually grew louder. And it was a pathetic voice mixed with sobbing.\nJust as Cyril was about to get up, thinking that something must have happened, the door was kicked open with force.\n\"Hmm? Is this the student council room?\"\nCyril knew the man who rudely opened the door with his foot.\nHe was Hubert Dee, a transfer student who recently arrived at Serendia Academy, the nephew of the Seven Sages, the Artillery Magician, and a troublemaker who was expelled from Minerva, a prestigious school for magicians, after repeating two years. He was transferred to Serendia Academy because his relatives were concerned about his public image.\nAlthough he was in a different class, he was taking the same advanced combat magic class as Cyril, so Cyril knew his face and name.\nNormally, you can't take advanced combat magic classes unless you have taken combat magic and basic magic classes in your first and second years, but Hubert, who graduated from Minerva, was exempted from that. His magic skills were that excellent to make him so special. He had only taken a few classes with him, but it was obvious that Hubert's ability was outstanding.\nBut why was Hubert Dee carrying Monica Norton on his shoulder?\nMonica was crying in a desperate voice, \"Let me down…\" and anyone could see that it was not a normal situation. On the other side of the door, which was left open, curious students stopped and paid attention to the student council room.\nIn the tense atmosphere, Felix asked Hubert.\n\"You're Hubert Dee, the transfer student, right… Why are you carrying that girl on your shoulder? It seems to be against her will.\"\n\"Hmm? I have something I want to negotiate directly. I'll say it straight. Monica is going to join the Magic Duel Research Club, so let her quit the student council.\"\nHubert's words caused a stir among the students in the hallway. In the midst of that, Monica sobbed and pleaded in a thin voice.\n\"…No, no… Please, forgive me… I don't want to quit the student council…\"\n\"Hmm? Are you in a position to argue with me? Huh, Moniicaa?\"\n\"…!\"\nWhen Hubert whispered to Monica, Monica turned pale and trembled. It was obvious to anyone that Monica was being threatened.\nCyril prepared himself to chant at any time, but Felix stopped him by raising his hand.\nThe gentle smile disappeared from Felix's face, and his cold eyes stared at Hubert.\n\"Monica Norton is not supposed to be taking any magic-related classes. Why do you want her to join the Magic Duel Research Club?\"\n\"Hmm? There's only one reason why I'm taking this girl to the club room every day, right?\"\nMonica's face turned pale. At that moment, Monica was worried that she would be exposed as a magician. But Hubert, anticipating that, grinned maliciously and said.\n\"Hmm hmm? I have only one reason to take this girl to the club room every day. You can buy a woman who only has a good face and body at a brothel, but no one can satisfy me (in magic duel) but her, right?\"\nThe air in the room froze.\n\"Cyril.\"\nThe word uttered by Felix was not a voice of restraint, but an attack order. Cyril activated the ice magic with a shortened chant. The ice spear that grew from the floor was pointed at Hubert's chin.\nHowever, Hubert did not flinch and instead whistled happily.\n\"Hmm hmm, good arm. I didn't think there would be anyone who could do a shortened chant at Serendia Academy.\"\n\"Shut your vulgar mouth and release Treasurer Norton.\"\n\"What if I say no?\"\nCyril waved his finger lightly as he chanted. Ice chains wrapped around Hubert's wrists.\n\"I'll make you a silent ice statue.\"\nCyril glared at Hubert with his blue eyes, but Hubert still smiled confidently.\nBut suddenly his body wobbled. Someone jumped on him from behind.\n\"Let go of Monica!!\"\nIt was Glenn Dudley who tackled Hubert. Apparently, he had accelerated with flying magic on the way.\nHubert staggered and Monica, who was on his shoulder, fell to the floor. But before Monica was slammed to the floor, someone caught her small body.\n\"Are you hurt? Miss Monica\"\nIt was Roberto Vinkel who caught Monica with his muscular arms rolled up his sleeves despite being midwinter.\nMonica seemed to be in a trance and didn't respond to Robert's voice. Robert frowned and said, \"How pitiful…\"\nHubert slowly got up and cracked his neck, then looked at Felix, not Glenn or Robert or Cyril.\n\"Hey, an assault case happened right in front of the student council president… are you going to keep quiet?\"\n\"Assault case? You're saying something funny. This is a pure disciplinary action.\"\n\"Ho-ho?\"\nHubert narrowed his eyes and looked around the room.\nCyril Ashley, who was preparing for the next magic, Glenn Dudley, who was about to jump on him, Roberto Vinkel, who was holding Monica and glaring at Hubert… and finally Felix Ark Ridill.\n\"Then, I'll follow your style. Let's have a proper duel, shall we?\"\n\"…Duel?\"\nFelix replied coldly to Hubert, who waved his ring-covered hand and laughed, \"Sorry, I don't have a glove to challenge you to a duel.\"\n\"You guys love to care about appearances, right? A duel for a woman. It's good, right? It's exciting, right? It's fun, right?\"\nIt was clear that Hubert had no intention of backing down. Hubert would stick to his will and overcome the situation with violence, even if he was expelled.\nOn top of that, he proposed a compromise: a duel with rules.\n\"Let's have a magic duel. I'm alone on this side. You can have as many as you want. If I beat you all, Monica is mine. But if you win, I'll give up Monica… Easy, right?\"\nHubert's blatant provocation was met with an immediate response from Glenn and Robert.\n\"Bring it on!! This time… I'll knock you down!\"\n\"As a knight aspirant, and as a candidate for Miss Monica's fiance, I accept your challenge.\"\nAs Glenn and Robert became enthusiastic, Hubert grinned and looked up at Felix.\nIn this situation, where the hallway was also crowded with people, Felix couldn't back down if it got this heated. Hubert had anticipated that and challenged him to a duel.\nAmong the student council officers, there was only one person who could do a magic duel. Felix looked at Cyril.\n\"Vice President Cyril Ashley.\"\nAs Cyril responded with a ‘yes,' Felix told him with the coldest face ever.\n\"It's an order. Win this duel… We can't afford to lose our important treasurer.\"\n\"As you wish.\"\nAt that moment, it was decided that a duel for the student council Treasurer Monica Norton would take place.\nMonica was no longer able to escape from reality into the world of numbers and kept asking herself why this was happening.",

      "content": "It had been snowing until a few days ago at Serendia Academy, but today the snow stopped before noon, and a thin blue sky peeked through the cloudy sky. The sound of a violin echoed loudly in the ballroom, where the winter sky could be seen outside the window. The melody with a sense of speed made the listeners' hearts soar and boil involuntarily. As soon as the phrase of the performance ended, the violinist Benjamin Moulding shouted to the audience in a loud voice.\n\"This is the beginning of a battle of men for the sake of a maiden! The instigator of this duel is the fiery redhead transfer student, Hubert Dee! He will face three brave young men! Who will win this deadly battle and gain the maiden's favor! The battle of men who will not give up is about to begin here and now! Oh, engrave the fortune of witnessing the first magic duel in the history of Serendia Academy in your chest, and let me play the emotion, the excitement, here and now with my violin! First, the first movement……\"\nBenjamin stood on the platform at the far end of the dance hall. The students in the audience cheered as they pleased at Benjamin's impassioned speech. Elliot, who was sitting in the audience, looked at Monica with sympathy.\nThe student council members were basically sitting side by side in the front row, but Monica was sitting in the row behind them, and her friends Lana and Claudia were sitting on either side of her. Felix had thought that it would be better for Monica to be with her friends since she looked so pale.\n\"Miss Norton, are you breathing? Hey?\"\nElliot called out to Monica, who was sitting behind him, but Monica didn't budge. When Elliot waved his hand in front of Monica's face, Claudia, who was sitting to Monica's left, muttered.\n\"She's fainted while sitting.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThe rumor of the duel proposed by Hubert Dee spread throughout the academy in just three days and aroused the speculation of many students. The school's concern was that the students who came to watch the commotion might accidentally enter the barrier and get caught up in it. So the student council decided to set up a place where they could watch the magic duel, and convince the teachers.\nThe magic duel could be projected onto a crystal ball by incorporating a farsight technique into the barrier. The crystal ball could then be set to a projection device, which could project the image onto a large white cloth stretched on the stage.\nThus, a spectator seat of the same size as the outdoor stage of the cultural festival was set up in the dance hall, but the number of students who crowded in was more than expected. Some of them were even standing, and it was a bit of a festival.\nAfter all, the people who participated in this duel were all well-known students.\nHubert Dee, a transfer student who has a bad attitude, but is the nephew of the Seven Sages.\nCyril Ashley, known as the \"Ice Prince\" and one of the most powerful students in the academy, serves as the Vice President of the Student Council.\nGlenn Dudley, a disciple of the Seven Sages, gained fame by playing the role of a hero during the school festival, instantly becoming a well-known figure.\nAnd lastly, Roberto Vinkel, an academically excellent exchange student from Randall.\nMoreover, since Cyril's participation was ordered by the student council president Felix, Cyril was practically Felix's proxy. It was natural for the students to be excited.\nFelix had set up this stage for reasons other than ensuring the safety of the students.\nThis commotion was no longer possible to hide. So instead of having a secret duel, he decided to stage it as a glamorous stage and make Monica a tragic heroine.\nThe one who helped him with that was the up-and-coming musician Benjamin Moulding.\nHis slightly exaggerated speech and excellent music helped to make this duel more theatrical.\n…That was the situation that led to the present, but the tragic heroine sitting in the audience was already reaching her physical and mental limits. Her expression was not that of a heroine watching the duel of men, but that of a prisoner sentenced to death, or a dying patient.\nIf Lana and the others hadn't let her skip the afternoon classes and take a nap, Monica wouldn't have been able to walk this far.\nAs Monica pressed her stomach which was hurting, Lana next to her said \"Ah\". If she followed her gaze, she could see the image of the forest, the venue of the duel, projected on the white cloth on the stage. At first, it was an aerial view of the forest, but gradually it zoomed in on the forest and then showed a man.\nIt was the culprit of this commotion, the fiery redhead, Hubert Dee.\nThe image switched again, and this time it showed the three challengers standing near the entrance of the forest, Cyril Ashley, Glenn Dudley, and Roberto Vinkel.\nWhen the magic duel barrier was activated, physical attacks were nullified, and only magic could inflict damage. Therefore, bringing weapons was meaningless, but for some reason, only Robert had a sword hanging from his waist. The others were basically in their usual uniform and empty-handed.\nThe magic duel barrier could be added with effects such as reducing pain or forcing a return when their mana reached a certain number. That was the barrier that Monica used in the Seven Sages selection test. But to add those effects, a huge amount of mana and a magic tool to maintain the barrier were needed.\nThe barrier that was set up in the training ground of Serendia Academy seemed to be unable to add the effects of pain reduction or forced return. In other words, the damage would be accompanied by the pain.\nInside the barrier, even if you were attacked, your body would not be hurt, and only your mana would decrease, but the magic battle would not end until you lost consciousness.\nThey wouldn't get hurt, but Cyril and the others might feel pain. Just thinking that, Monica's body became cold.\n\"Hey, by the way, is that Dee guy really that strong? It's going to be three against one, right?\"\nMonica was at a loss for words at Lana's question. How much should she tell about Hubert? If she talked too much, it would reveal that Monica was in Minerva.\n\"Um, I don't know, maybe…\"\nMonica mumbled and stuttered, and Claudia muttered with a gloomy face.\n\"…He's the nephew of the Artillery Magician, so he must be a strong fighter.\"\nHubert's uncle, the Artillery Magician, Bradford Firestone, was one of the most powerful fighters among the Seven Sages.\nHis specialty is using six-fold enhanced attack magic, which could only be blocked by the same Seven Sages, the Barrier Magician, Louis Miller.\nBut Hubert's fighting style was the opposite of his uncle, who preferred to use more moves rather than put power into one shot.\nSimply looking at the amount of mana, Glenn and Lord Cyril are higher, but…\nMonica was anxious.\n…Hubert Dee's real specialty was not \"magic.\" It was \"hunting.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThe magic duel took place in the forest near Serendia Academy. Hubert had moved to the back of the forest beforehand, while Glenn, Cyril, and Robert waited near the entrance of the forest until the bell rang to start.\nGlenn bent and stretched his knees lightly to warm up, and then voiced the question he had been wondering about.\n\"We can't use physical attacks inside the magic duel barrier, right?\"\n\"What are you talking about now? Don't tell me you didn't know that?\"\nCyril snapped at him, and Glenn hurriedly replied.\n\"Of course, I know that! I mean, that guy over there!\"\nHe said, pointing at Roberto, who was wearing leather gloves and bending and stretching his fingers.\nRoberto looked up from his gloves and looked at Glenn.\n\"What about me?\"\n\"Your sword is useless in a magic duel, right? It'll bounce off the barrier.\"\n\"I know that. It's no problem.\"\nGlenn didn't know much about Roberto. He only heard that he was an exchange student from the Randall Kingdom and that he had the same elective class as Monica.\nRoberto seemed to be younger than Glenn, but he was about the same height. What was different was the thickness of his muscles. That was the body of someone who trained regularly.\nAs Glenn secretly admired him, Cyril glanced at Roberto and muttered.\n\"…A magic sword, huh?\"\n\"Yes, that's right.\"\nRoberto nodded and drew his sword from his waist. The sword was broken at a point about a thumb's length from the guard. But when Roberto chanted, water gushed out from the broken part and formed a blade.\nGlenn had learned a little bit about the technique of magic swords from Louis.\nIt was a technique mainly used by the knights of the neighboring Randall Kingdom, and there were various variations, such as making a blade from mana from the tip of the sword like Robert, making a handle from mana as well, or enhancing a normal sword with auxiliary magic.\n\"Why don't you just use auxiliary magic on a normal sword?\"\n\"Swords that can withstand auxiliary magic are very rare. Some people make them from mana from the handle, but I prefer to use the handle I'm used to, so I do it this way.\"\nAs Glenn nodded in admiration, Roberto put his magic sword back to its original state, and put the thumb-length steel into the scabbard, saying.\n\"Let me say it first. I intend to defeat Senior Hubert Dee and have Monica join my chess club. Therefore, I can't give up the role of taking down Senior Hubbard Dee to you two.\"\nAt this declaration, Cyril twitched his thin eyebrows and glared at Robert.\n\"I can't let it slide. Treasurer Norton is a student council member. I can't hand her over to another club. It's against His Highness's wishes.\"\n\"This duel is supposed to be a bet on Miss Monica herself. Then there should be no problem.\"\n\"Don't twist the rules to your liking!\"\nCyril wrinkled his nose in disgust. A cold and chilly mana was already drifting around him.\n\"It is my duty, as commanded by His Highness, to defeat Hubert Dee. You two should just stand by and watch.\"\n\"Wait a minute! I want to be the one to defeat that senior! That person… I'm the only one who can defeat him!\"\nGlenn argued in a stronger tone than usual, and then Roberto intervened.\n\"No, I'm the one who will defeat him.\"\n\"It's me!\"\n\"He's mine!\"\nThe three glared at each other for a while, but none of them showed any sign of backing down.\nThen there was only one conclusion. This magic duel was a race to see who would defeat Hubert Dee first.\nAnd so, the three challengers showed no sign of cooperating, and the magic duel was about to begin.\n\"By the way, I wanted to ask you something before the match.\"\n\"What a coincidence, so did I.\"\nThey said, looking at Roberto, specifically, his bare arms.\n\"Why are you rolling up your sleeves?\"\n\"It's winter now. Aren't you cold?\"\nThe two looked at him suspiciously, and Roberto flexed his arm, making his muscles bulge, and said.\n\"It's an appeal of masculine charm.\"\nThe two pretended they didn't hear that.",

      "content": "Hubert Dee walked among the trees in the forest where the magic duel was held, humming a tune.\nHe had already prepared his \"hunt\". He just had to wait for his prey to come.\nHis uncle, the Artillery Magician, cared about how much he could boost the power of one shot, but Hubert valued something different.\nWhat mattered to him was how much fun he could have hunting his prey.\n\"Hmm hmm hmm… I wonder how much they'll entertain me.\"\nHubert leaned against a random tree and closed his eyes.\nHe remembered the witch who had overwhelmed him in Minerva—the Silent Witch, Monica Everett. She was thirteen or fourteen years old at the time, and she was even thinner and poorer than she is now, a ragged little girl.\nThe magicians of Minerva were divided into two types: those who were good at combat and those who liked research. Monica was clearly the latter, a scholar type, and Hubert thought so too.\nBut in just five seconds after the magic duel started, Hubert realized his mistake.\nHe knew that Monica was a user of chantless spells. But he thought that it didn't matter whether it was chantless or not, as long as it didn't hit.\nBut what was terrifying was the accuracy of hitting a needle's eye. Monica controlled her magic precisely with just calculation, without using any tracking magic—and in just three seconds after the magic duel started, she hit Hubert with all her shots.\nHubert, who had planned to hunt a rabbit, was attacked by a monster wearing a rabbit's skin.\nHe couldn't forget the excitement he felt then. The feeling of challenging an overwhelmingly strong monster was similar to the thrill of conquering a vast mountain.\nHe wanted to subdue that strong creature! Make her kneel! Kill her and make her a stuffed animal!\nHe was made to despair by the overwhelming difference in power, but still, he pulled the thread of hope, racked his brains, and set up all kinds of traps to catch that prey. She was the only one in the world who was such a great prey!\n\"Hmm hmm hmm, I'm looking forward to it, Monica. I've been wanting to do you for so long, I was dying of frustration.\"\nThe moment he licked his tongue, he heard a bell ringing from afar. It was the signal for the start of the magic duel. As soon as the signal was given, Hubert activated his sensing magic and saw that his three prey were moving in different directions. One of them was moving at a tremendous speed. He was probably using flying magic to move fast.\nHubert left the tree trunk and cracked his thin neck.\n\"But first… let's hang up one of them as a warning.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAs soon as the bell rang to start the magic duel, Glenn activated his flying magic and flew higher than the trees.\nGlenn couldn't use the sensing magic. He could only use this flying magic and fireball magic for attack. So he had no choice but to look for Hubert directly.\nFortunately, the leaves of the trees had fallen in the winter forest, and he found Hubert's figure right away.\nBack then, he had no choice but to flee in tears when that man challenged him to a magic duel. But when he was cornered, his mana went berserk. Minerva deemed him as a threat and locked him up.\nI'm not the same as I used to be!\nGlenn stayed still in the air with his flying magic and chanted.\nHe conjured a huge fireball, as big as a ring made by two adults with their hands, and hurled it at Hubert below.\n\"Take thaaaat!\"\nThe forest was protected by the barrier, so the fire magic wouldn't cause a fire. That's why Glenn could attack without holding back.\nA loud boom echoed and a thick smoke rose as the fireball hit. But Glenn didn't relax and chanted again, ready to fire the next shot.\nDon't stop attacking until you stop the enemy's breath\n– that was the dangerous lesson his teacher taught him.\nBut before Glenn could make the second fireball, a flash of light shot out of the smoke. A thunder arrow—Hubert's counterattack.\nGlenn stopped chanting and dodged the thunder arrow with his flying magic. Glenn still couldn't fire attack magic while moving. He could use it if he stayed still in the air, but Hubert's attack didn't let him.\nIf he stayed like this, he would be sniped from the smoke. Glenn decided to lower his altitude and…\n\"Hmm hmm. First, one of them.\"\nHe gasped at the voice that came from behind him.\nHe turned around quickly and saw Hubert's thunder spear swinging down at him, who had circled behind Glenn with his flying magic. Glenn twisted his body to avoid a direct hit, but his right arm was still pierced by the thunder spear and he screamed.\n\"Aaaaargh!\"\nHis consciousness was cut off for a moment by the pain, and his flying magic was canceled.\nPhysical \"attacks\" are nullified in the barrier, but the barrier doesn't respond to \"accidents\" that it doesn't recognize as \"attacks\".\nThat's how Glenn fell from a high place. If he stayed like this, he would be smashed to the ground and die. But a giant water ball softly caught Glenn's body. Glenn sank into the water ball, killing the momentum of his fall. The water ball was not created by Glenn or Hubert.\n\"Damn it, what a pain!\"\nCyril snapped his fingers and released the water ball. He was good at ice magic, and he seemed to have learned some water magic as well.\nGlenn, who was soaked all over, coughed and thanked Cyril.\n\"Thank you, Vice President!\"\n\"You should reflect on your recklessness!\"\nCyril, who said he wouldn't cooperate, but ended up taking care of his junior, cast a defensive barrier with a shortened chant. The barrier blocked the thunder arrows that rained down from above.\n\"Be alert not only above, but also around, Glenn Dudley! The enemy has also learned remote magic!\"\nGlenn understood why he was attacked when he heard the remote magic.\nHubert was in the smoke, moving behind Glenn with his flying magic, and firing thunder arrows from the ground with his remote magic. To make Glenn think he was still in the smoke.\nRemote magic is a high-level technique that allows magic to be activated at a distance from the user. If applied, it can also be used as a decoy.\n\"Damn it, the barrier won't last! Glenn Dudley! Can't you use a defensive barrier!?\"\n\"I can only use flying magic and fireballs!\"\n\"Are you still a disciple of the Barrier Magician!? Damn it, scatter!\"\n\"Roger!\"\nAs Cyril's defensive barrier was destroyed, Glenn and Cyril ran away and hid in the shadows of the trees.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nHubert looked down at Glenn and Cyril from the sky, feeling a thrill from the battle, but also keeping a cool head.\nMy first target, \"Glenn Dudley\", could use flying magic and fireball magic. He could use them simultaneously, but he couldn't use attack magic while moving. He lacked the ability to use shortened chanting or defensive barriers, so his only options to evade his attacks were to flee or dodge with flying magic. He claimed to be a disciple of the Barrier Magician, but his magic skills were hardly better than a beginner's…\nWithin the barrier of a magic duel, the participant's mana would decrease according to the damage taken. The thunder spear that Hubert fired at Glenn Dudley didn't hit him directly, but it was a strike that would have disabled someone with low mana.\nYet, he took that and still moved around with energy, which meant he had a lot of mana.\nAnd the defensive barrier that Cyril Ashley used to block the thunder arrows. Judging by the duration and strength, he also had a lot of mana.\nMy other target, \"Cyril Ashley\", was someone he had seen in the advanced combat magic class. He could only use water and ice attributes. He could use defensive barriers and shortened chanting. He could also use two magic at the same time. He had low mobility because he couldn't use flying magic, but he used magic skillfully. He excelled in terms of technique. He also had a lot of mana.\nThe truth was, Hubert's mana was not that impressive. It was not low, but if the battle dragged on, Hubert would run out of mana first.\nI could use my \"trump card\" here, but… there was one more hiding. He was calm. It's like he was waiting for the two hotheads to go first, and then act after reading his moves.\nHubert activated his sensing magic, but he couldn't locate Roberto Vinkle. He was hiding very well. If his hiding technique was that good, it would be hard to find him with the sensing magic.\nMoreover, sensing magic and flying magic both consumed a lot of mana. He couldn't keep using them. He had to conserve his mana as much as possible.\n…First, I would flush out the one hiding.\nFrom what he saw, the three challengers had no coordination or cooperation. That was his opportunity.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nCyril hid in the shadow of a tree and watched the situation. Hubert slowly descended from the sky. He looked so relaxed that it made Cyril angry.\nIf he and Glenn attacked him together, they could overpower Hubert with their firepower.\nBut there was one problem—Cyril's specialty was ice, and Glenn's was fire. They were incompatible in every way. If they attacked at the same time, Cyril's attack might be nullified by Glenn's.\nThe impulsive Glenn fired a fireball at Hubert right away. Hubert dodged it by flying low with his flying magic. He didn't use a defensive barrier because it couldn't stop Glenn's attack. Glenn's fireball was that powerful… but it was useless if it missed.\nCyril aimed an ice arrow at Hubert, weaving between Glenn's attacks. The attack also used a tracking technique, and it targeted Hubert precisely, but it was blocked by a defensive barrier.\n…I can repel low-power magic with high accuracy with the barrier and avoid high-power with flying magic.\nHe had to stop his movement first.\nCyril started a slightly longer chant. Hubert looked at Cyril warily, but it was too late.\n\"Take this!\"\nCyril created a wall of ice with his ice magic in the direction that Hubert was flying away. Hubert hurriedly changed direction, but the ice wall extended to the left and right, trapping Hubert.\n\"Now, finish him off! Glenn Dudley!\"\nAs if responding to Cyril's voice, Glenn fired another fireball. A mass of flame approached Hubert, who was trapped by the ice wall.\n\"That's naive.\"\nHubert made a sudden ascent at the last moment before Glenn's fireball hit. Since Cyril's ice wall didn't reach the sky, it would leave Glenn's fireball to fly without hitting the target… but.\n\"The naive one is you.\"\nThe fireball suddenly followed Hubert as if it had a mind of its own. Hubert's face twisted in panic for the first time.\n\"Tracking technique… you could use it…!\"\n\"I just learned it!\"\nHubert, who was caught off guard, took Glenn's fireball head-on and fell to the ground like a bird with its wings shot. They were going to finish him off here, and Cyril and Glenn started chanting again.\nBut before their chants were done, someone jumped out of the shadows of the trees. It was Roberto Vinkel, who had been hiding until now.\n\"I'll take your head.\"\nHe said something very dangerous and drew his sword. Water flowed out of the short steel tip and turned into a blade.\nRoberto closed the distance with Hubert with his amazing physical skills and swung his water blade at Hubert's neck, who had fallen to the ground…\nAnd then, Roberto's movement stopped.\nIt wasn't just Roberto. Cyril and Glenn also felt a sharp pain in their backs and stopped moving.\n\"What is it?\"\nThe moment he turned around, a flame arrow pierced Cyril's chest.\nThere was no physical damage from magic attacks in the barrier. But the pain was reproduced as it was. Cyril let out a groan of pain as his skin and organs were burned, and fell to his knees.\nHe glanced around and saw that Glenn and Roberto were also attacked by flame arrows and fell to their knees.\nRemote magic? But Hubert didn't chant at all… this is like…\n\"Hmm, hmm, hmm~\"\nHubert waved his finger with a catchy tune, like a conductor.\nFlame arrows rained down on their bodies again. Arms, legs, torso, and face, were burned and gouged alive. Their screams echoed in the forest.\nChanting was absolutely necessary for a magician. There was no way he could cast magic while singing a song.\nThat means he could do…\n\"…chant… less… magic…\"\nCyril's vision was closed by the approaching flame arrow.\nAnd with the pain of his right eye being pierced, Cyril lost consciousness.",

      "content": "The venue was filled with commotion.\nThe images projected on the stage did not have any sound. But still, Cyril's, Glenn's, and Roberto's suffering and screams were conveyed clearly.\n…And that Hubert was manipulating flame arrows without chanting.\nFelix stared at the scene without blinking.\nWhen someone said \"Chantless magic?\", the buzz spread quickly. Chantless magic could only be used by one person in the world… the Silent Witch.\nWas he the Silent Witch? No, Lady Everett was a woman. That was certain… but what if the woman I met was a hallucination or something?\nIn Felix's pocket, his contract spirit Wildean in the shape of a lizard was unusually confused as it wriggled.\nIf Cyril and the others were defeated, Felix intended to intervene with Wildean and dispose of Hubert secretly. But if Hubert was a user of chantless magic, could Wildean, who was not good at combat, do anything about it?\nAs Felix was hesitating, Lana screamed behind him.\n\"Monica, are you okay? Monica!\"\nWhen Felix turned around, Monica had a pale face, covering her mouth with her hand, and shivering.\nIn the image, Hubert fired flame arrows and maliciously gouged Cyril and the others' limbs. Every time, Monica gasped and trembled with tears in her eyes.\n\"…Stop it… please, stop…\"\nMonica's voice was so faint that it was almost drowned out by the commotion.\nLana, who was sitting next to her, rubbed Monica's back, but Monica looked like she was going to vomit.\n\"…Why don't you go throw up?\"\nClaudia told her bluntly, and Monica nodded and staggered to her feet.\nLana, who had a worried look on her face, tried to accompany her, but Monica shook her head and refused.\n\"…Lana, watch it… in my place… who… wins…\"\nShe said that and left her seat. She walked fast for someone who was slow.\nFelix thought for a moment and got up. Bridget, sitting next to him, covered her mouth with a fan and looked up at Felix.\n\"Taking care of Monica Norton?\"\n\"I can't leave her alone.\"\n\"I see. Then, I will burn the details of this magic duel in my eyes on behalf of you, Your Highness. As a secretary, I will record this match so that it can be preserved.\"\n\"Thank you.\"\nFelix returned the words with a bitter smile and looked for Monica.\nMany people were standing near the audience seats, so it was difficult to find the petite Monica if she got lost in the crowd. Felix checked that the people around him were not paying attention to him and ordered Wildean.\n\"Wildean. Intervene in the magic duel and dispose of Hubert Dee in a way that looks like an accident. I don't care how you do it.\"\n\"…What about you, Your Highness?\"\n\"I'm looking for Monica. I'm worried if she's fallen or something along the way.\"\n\"…As you wish.\"\nAfter confirming Wildean had crawled out of his pocket and moved quickly, Felix looked for Monica. Unbeknownst to him, the girl he was looking for was heading to the forest with her unfamiliar flying magic.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAn unpleasant humming sound was heard.\nAmidst the intense pain, Cyril's consciousness surfaced for a brief moment. He moved his blurry eyes and saw Roberto lying limp on the ground, and behind him, Glenn was being tortured by Hubert.\n\"Hmm, hmm, hmm, it's so pitiful that you guys with a lot of mana can't faint easily, isn't it?\"\nHubert said that and flicked his finger, and a flame arrow gouged Glenn's body. There was no damage to his flesh or clothes, but Glenn's body twitched with pain. He was already in too much pain to even scream, and only a thin breathing sound came from Glenn's mouth. Cyril tried to chant and retaliate against Hubert, but he couldn't even move his lips. Cyril's mana had already hit rock bottom. He was able to regain his consciousness barely, probably because he had a magic overconsumption constitution.\nIt was inconvenient to have a constitution that absorbed mana more easily than others, but it was useful at times like this… but it was too late to do anything with his mana so low.\nThere was no way Cyril could retaliate against Hubert now. He could use magic without chanting.\n…But, is he really using chantless magic?\nIf Hubert could use chantless magic freely, why didn't he use it from the start?\nThe advantage of chantless magic was to catch the opponent off guard and take the initiative. But Hubert didn't try to use chantless magic until Roberto showed up. Now that he thought about it, he took Glenn's fireball to lure out Roberto, who was hiding.\n…Did he not want Roberto Vinkel to observe him using chantless magic? Maybe he had some trick up his sleeve?\nThen Cyril noticed something. Hubert's hand… he should have had several tacky rings on his knotty fingers. But now he only had one ring on his right middle finger. Come to think of it, when he fought Hubert in this forest, he already had only one ring.\nWait! That's it!\nCyril unconsciously reached for the brooch on his collar, as he always did. But he couldn't even move a finger. His hazy consciousness was about to sink into the darkness again. His vision was starting to blur white.\n…No, this is… fog?\nBefore he knew it, a thick fog had enveloped the area. He could barely see the scenery a few steps ahead, and Hubert's figure was only a vague silhouette.\nIt was too unnatural to be a naturally occurring fog. It was reasonable to assume that it was caused by some kind of magic, but the only one who could move in this situation was Hubert.\nAnd he didn't understand why Hubert would bother to create fog.\nWhat's going on…?\nIn Cyril's confused vision, a small figure approached Hubert. A really small figure. Compared to Hubert, it looked like a young child.\nThe young figure muttered something in a low voice. His voice was too small for Cyril to hear well… but Hubert's loud laughter was annoyingly clear.\n\"Ahahaha! Ah, ah, you're the best! You know…\n…My dear Silent Witch!\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nMonica knew the spell formula for flying magic and had perfect control over mana manipulation. However, she had always struggled with her sense of balance, and jumping high was the best she could do. But in this urgent situation, Monica activated her flying magic without hesitation.\nThe sense of balance was mainly tested when changing direction. If she didn't fly too high and just flew straight, Monica could barely manage it. It wasn't something she could use frequently because if she accidentally collided with a person or an obstacle, it would lead to a major accident.\nShe flew straight as far as she could, then deactivated the spell at the corner to adjust her course before activating it again. In this way, Monica consumed more mana than necessary while moving quickly toward the entrance of the forest. She created a mist with chantless magic, shrouding the entire forest. Manipulating the weather was considered a forbidden spell, but as long as it covered only a part of the forest, it wouldn't be considered a forbidden spell.\nCovering herself with mist to hide her presence, Monica ventured deeper into the forest.\nUsing her perception spell, it wasn't too hard to find Hubert's whereabouts.\nHubert was humming a tune while kicking someone… it was Glenn. He seemed to have lost consciousness, his eyes closed tightly.\nWith a slight movement of her gaze, Monica could see Cyril and Robert lying on the ground. They seemed to have fainted and were motionless.\nThe sight chilled Monica's insides as if a coldness settled in her stomach. Her fingertips were cold, not just because of the cold weather.\nMonica clenched both fists tightly. Her left hand throbbed with pain, but she didn't mind.\n\"…Senior Dee.\"\nWhen Monica muttered, Hubert's humming abruptly stopped. Hubert tilted his head and looked at Monica, grinning widely. His sanpaku eyes sparkled with delight, like a hunter who had found his prey. That expression always terrified Monica. It still did, even now.\n…But there was a stronger emotion that dominated Monica at the moment.\n\"I… I'm probably very, very angry right now.\"\nMonica, who was always inexperienced with anger, raised her head and stared at the towering figure in front of her. And then, she said one word.\n\"…I'm going to hit you hard.\"\nHubert looked taken aback for a moment, then he arched his body backward and burst into laughter.\n\"Ahahaha! Oh, oh, you're the best! The Silent Witch indeed!\"\nHubert laughed heartily, his throat trembling with excitement, as he looked at Monica.\nNormally, Monica would immediately avert her gaze, but now she stared back at Hubert with calm eyes, just like when she focused on a chessboard.\n\"This magical duel… can anyone be a challenger? Then, I'll join as an unexpected participant.\"\n\"Oh, yeah! That's great! Only you can truly satisfy me… Can you make me feel the ultimate thrill?\"\nMonica's words were met with Hubert's laughter, filled with anticipation.",

      "content": "The water spirit Wildean was puzzled. He had finally reached the forest, but the forest was shrouded in a thick fog.\nAnd it was not just a normal fog. It was probably a fog created by a magic spell, containing a lot of mana.\nThe mana of the fog dulled Wildean's perception ability. He couldn't sense where the magic duel was taking place.\n…Anyway, I have to hurry and knock down Hubert Dee\nIt would be easier to move if he transformed into a human, but if he was seen by anyone, it would spell disaster. Wildean navigated the forest in his lizard form.\nThis order was just a whim of his master. The original purpose was far away.\nBut his master probably wanted to help a girl named Monica Norton.\nDid His Highness take a liking to Miss Monica Norton… is it because they resemble each other?\nHe had such a thought in his mind, but Wildean stopped thinking any further.\nIt was not appropriate for a contracted spirit like him to step into his master's heart with his dirty feet.\nEventually, when the fog thinned, Wildian spotted two figures ahead. He stuck to a tree in his lizard form and stopped to watch.\nThat's…\nOne of the two people Wildean found was the teacher of practical magic spells, MacLegan, who was in charge of maintaining the barrier of this magic battle.\nMacLegan rubbed his arms as if he were cold and walked while talking to the other person.\n\"Hubert Dee excelled in magic spells, but his true talent lay in crafting magic tools. The problem is that he was indifferent to that talent and only developed dangerous magic tools that he could use for hunting. He was a troublesome delinquent… well, not as much as someone else.\"\n\"Hahaha, young blood runs hot, wouldn't you say?\"\nThe one who smiled brightly with his white teeth was one of the Seven Sages, the Barrier Magician Louis Miller.\nMacLegan said he would call for help for the barrier reinforcement of this magic duel, and it seemed that the helper was Louis.\nIt was a very luxurious helper to have one of the Seven Sages, but it was not surprising since his disciple Glenn Dudley was participating in this magic duel.\nWhat was truly surprising was the words that MacLegan uttered afterward.\n\"So, how are you going to settle this magic duel? You can't make it public that the Silent Witch won by herself, can you?\"\n\"Hubert Dee's magic tool went berserk and self-destructed. Why not make it a draw?\"\n…The Silent Witch intervened in this magic duel!?\nThat was the magician that Wildean's master revered from the bottom of his heart.\nHis master had been obsessed with finding the Silent Witch lately. He would look for a girl who had injured her left hand whenever he had time.\nFelix probably didn't want to do anything to her when he found her. He just wanted to see her true face. The strong and beautiful witch he admired.\nWildean wanted to fulfill his master's wish as a contracted spirit. So he slid down from the tree to the ground and followed Louis and MacLegan.\n\"I was surprised when I saw Everett. I pretended not to know, thinking it was a mission.\"\n\"Thank you for your consideration, Mr. MacLegan.\"\n\"But isn't she incredible? That high-level tracking formula, I have to get her to submit a paper soon… and rewriting magic tool? That's brilliant, wouldn't you agree? That would break the pride of her opponents.\"\n\"She even rewrote my defensive barrier before. Cracked the dummy formula I spent so much effort on, effortless as you please.\"\n\"Did it sting your pride?\"\n\"Hahaha. If there's ever a national barrier rewriting incident in the future, I'll suspect the Silent Witch without a doubt. Yes.\"\nIt seemed that these two knew that the Silent Witch was in the academy.\nWould they slip up and reveal the identity of the Silent Witch, Wildean wondered as he watched them, but Louis stopped, scanning the surroundings.\nThey were probably looking for the participants of the magic duel. The magic duel was over, so they came to collect the participants.\n\"…I can't find them. Really, they're troublesome youngsters, making us search in this damn cold. Well, shall we try to find them with a sensing magic?\"\nAt Louis's words, Wildean hurriedly left the place.\nIf Louis activated the sensing magic, Wildean, a mass of mana and a high-ranking spirit, would be caught by the perception.\n…I wanted to see the Silent Witch if I could… but she's probably already out of the forest\nFor now, the duel for Monica Norton was settled as a draw. Wildean had no reason to fight Hubert anymore.\nNow he had to go back to Felix and report the Silent Witch's involvement.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nMonica, who had silenced Hubert, suppressed her urge to carry Cyril and the others to a warm place and hurried out of the forest.\nNow that the magic duel was over, someone would surely come to check the scene. Besides, she had been away from the spectator seats for a long time. Returning too late would raise suspicions from Lana and the others.\nEmploying the same unfamiliar flying magic she'd used before, she returned to the nearby viewing area, but she staggered greatly when she released the magic spell.\nNormally, she'd incorporate a magic formula to reduce mana usage of the magic spell, but the mental strain had rendered her incapable.\nMoreover, magic spells such as creating fog and flying require constant release of mana for a certain period, so the consumption of mana is inevitably high regardless of the presence or absence of the magic formula.\nOn top of mana depletion, sleep deprivation, lack of food, and mounting mental fatigue, pushed Monica’s body to the brink.\n(…I have to go back… to the spectator seats… Lana is worried…)\nShe moved her heavy feet and walked a few steps, then collapsed on the ground with a splash.\n(…No, I can’t continue… like this… I’ll cause… trouble again…)\nAgainst her will to get up, her consciousness sank deeper and deeper into the darkness. She couldn’t even keep her eyes open.\n“Monica”\nSomeone’s arm lifted Monica’s frail frame.\n(Ah… I’ve caused trouble for someone again…)\nA tear escaped, tracing a path down her cheek. With dry lips, she mumbled,\n“…I’m sorry… I’m sorry… I’m sorry for causing trouble…”\n＊ ＊ ＊\nMonica, cold enough to make him shiver, was in his arms again. Her cheeks were hollow, lips dry and cracked.\nHe had lifted Monica's body before, but she was clearly lighter than before. She must have been unable to eat or sleep properly because of the commotion caused by Hubert Dee.\nAs Felix walked towards the infirmary, Monica's mouth moved slightly.\n\"…I'm sorry… I'm sorry… I'm sorry for causing trouble…\"\nIt seemed that she was apologizing to someone in her dreams. It must be her habit.\nMonica would apologize desperately, as if she had made a terrible mistake, even for trivial things that no one cared much about.\n…You don't have to worry about it\nHe closed his eyes slightly, and a memory of his childhood flashed through his mind.\n\"……I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry for always causing trouble……Eig.\"\nThat's what his friend in the memory always said. He cried and shed tears from his clear blue eyes. He sobbed miserably.\nThe girl in his arms now overlapped with the image of his childhood friend.\nShe was a crybaby, timid, lacked confidence, and prone to self-blame… and yet, she didn't rely on him when it mattered.\n\"…I wish you had relied on me more\"\nHe whispered in a voice that no one could hear, and opened the door of the infirmary. There was no one in the infirmary. The staff must have gone to the scene of the magic duel.\nFelix laid Monica on the bed and combed her dry brown hair with his fingertips.\nHe understood on some levels, why he was obsessed with Monica.\nHe couldn't help but overlap her with his former friend.\nHe was convinced of that at Porter's bookstore. Monica's expression when he gave her the book she wanted, her whole body showing joy, overlapped with his childhood friend's.\n…Back then, nothing mattered more than his friend's happiness, even his own well-being.\nFelix's blue eyes shaded and sighed softly. He was aware that he was being too sentimental.\nFelix poked Monica's pale skin with his fingertips and muttered in a sulky voice.\n\"…It's your fault for not relying on me.\"\nMonica never relied on him. She never asked for anything. Furthermore, she said, \"I'm sorry for causing trouble\".\nThat's why Monica's words and actions stirred the emotions hidden in Felix's heart.\nAs he pinched Monica's cheeks for a while, he heard a voice from his feet saying \"Your Highness\". It was his contract spirit, Wildian.\n\"Hey, good job, Will. Did you finish off Hubert Dee?\"\n\"…I'm sorry. When I arrived, Lady Silent Witch had already… defeated Hubert Dee\"\n\"…Lady Everett?\"\nFelix was surprised and widened his eyes at the unexpected name.\nAccording to Willdean's report, the Silent Witch who intruded into the magic duel secretly defeated Hubert Dee. Wildean didn't witness the scene directly, but he heard MacLegan and Louis Miller talking about it.\nHe had a faint suspicion that Louis Miller was connected to the Silent Witch, but MacLegan was unexpected.\nHe wanted to interrogate him, but that old teacher was good at playing dumb, so he would never spill his mouth.\n… Lady Everett is certainly in the academy.\nHe had been secretly investigating a petite female student who had injured her left hand, but he had found no useful information so far.\nHe suspected that she was disguised as a maid of a lady who attended the academy, but that made the investigation much more difficult. The student council could not grasp the information of the maids, let alone the ladies themselves.\nAs Felix was thinking about that, Wildean climbed up his leg and settled in his usual pocket, saying.\n\"But why did the Silent Witch intervene in this magic duel?\"\nIndeed, if the Silent Witch was hiding her identity for some reason, why did she intrude into the magic duel that could expose her?\nAs Felix pondered, he looked at Monica sleeping on the bed and opened his eyes wide as a realization dawned on him.\n\"…Could it be that she knew I cared about this girl… and helped her behind the scenes?\"\nHe never thought that the girl sleeping in front of him right now was the Silent Witch herself.\nHe admired the Silent Witch as a hero, and more than that… he overlapped Monica with his friend.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThe spectator seats buzzed with whispers.\nMacLegan explained the magic duel ended abruptly due to poor visibility caused by the fog resulting in an accident where Hubert Dee's magic tool went berserk.\nElliott scratched his cheek with a troubled face in the noisy venue.\n\"This is bad, His Highness is away from his seat, and Cyril is missing too…\"\nThe student council members should be in charge of this situation, but the two top ones were away from their seats.\nAs Elliott reluctantly got up to go to the podium, Bridget stood up faster and went up to the podium.\n\"Everyone, please be quiet.\"\nHer clear soprano voice shook the ears of everyone in the venue.\nBridget waited for the students to calm down and pay attention to the podium, and opened her mouth.\n\"It might be very disappointing that we couldn't see the duel all the way through. But right now, the most important thing is to make sure the students who were involved in the accident are safe.\"\nBridget's voice was very beautiful, and she spoke well with good articulation and timing. It was a very easy-to-understand way of speaking.\nShe was also a person who was good at speaking in front of people, like Felix.\n\"The sun is already setting, so please return to your dorms. The student council will report the details of the incident later.\"\nWhen Bridget said that, the students scattered in different directions.\nThe thoughtful Neil quickly moved to guide the students from the back seats to the exit so that people would not concentrate too much at the exit. Bridget watched this and stepped down from the podium.\n\"Bridget.\"\nFelix came up to her quickly. He seemed to have just returned.\nBridget smiled faintly and slowly turned her face to Felix.\n\"Did you find Monica Norton?\"\n\"Yeah, she collapsed near the venue, so I took her to the infirmary\"\n\"…That must have been hard.\"\nAt Felix's words, Lana Colette, who was secretly listening, sighed in relief.\nShe would surely go to the infirmary to visit her friend Monica Norton later.\n\"Please refrain from visiting the infirmary, as it will be very busy with the people who fell in the magic duel soon. \"\nWhen Bridget said that, Lana frowned dissatisfied.\nWhile glancing at her sideways, Bridget said as if she had just noticed.\n\"Oh, but there are only four beds in the infirmary… If four men are brought in later, there won't be enough beds. Your Highness, if you don't mind, shall I have my servant take Monica Norton to the dormitory?\"\n\"That's right. You're more suitable handling her in the girls' dormitory. I'm sorry, but can I ask you to do that?\"\nBridget nodded with a perfect beautiful smile that anyone could see.\n\"…Yes, leave it to me.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThe bedding on her cheek felt silky smooth, like the feeling of smooth silk.\nIt felt just like the bed in the guest room assigned to the Seven Sages during the New Year's ceremony.\n\"Hmm…\"\nAs Monica woke up and realized that she was in an unfamiliar room, she slowly tilted her head.\n(…What was I doing just now?)\nRubbing her aching head, Monica slowly retraced her memories.\nShe remembered finishing the battle with Hubert and rushing back to the spectator area. But she couldn't recall anything after that.\n\"It seems you've woken up.\"\nWhen Monica turned her gaze to the cool voice, she locked eyes with Bridget, who was seated on the sofa.\nCaught off guard by the unexpected individual, Monica became even more bewildered.\n\"Um… can you tell me… where am I?\"\nHer questioning voice was painfully hoarse. As she pressed her aching throat and coughed, Bridget silently handed her a jug of water.\n\"T-Thank you… very much.\"\nMonica carefully tilted the jug of water. The content wasn't just ordinary water; it had the scent of edible flowers and citrus and a faint sweetness to it. It tasted like diluted fruit water, delicious. As Monica moistened her mouth, Bridget watched her drink the water and spoke.\n\"This is my room, you see.\"\nMonica wondered why she had been made to sleep in Bridget's room. She couldn't understand why she would be arranged in Bridget's private room, let alone in the infirmary or the attic of the dorm.\nBefore Monica could ask about this, Bridget spoke first.\n\"I'll just say it straight.\"\nHer fingers covered in lace gloves suddenly tightened around Monica's left wrist. Monica felt a sharp pain in her wrist.\n\"Aah!?\"\nMonica groaned involuntarily and dropped the empty water jug.\nBridget put the water jug that fell on the bedding on the side table with a thud. She looked straight at Monica and said in a cold voice.\n\"Monica Norton, just who exactly are you?\"",

      "content": "Bridget Graham's first invitation to Duke Crockford's mansion came when she was just seven years old.\nPrince Felix, the second prince, who happened to be the same age as Bridget, was residing at Duke Crockford's mansion to recover from an illness. The Duke's request was for Bridget to keep the prince company and engage in conversation.\nDespite her young age, Bridget, being quite intelligent, correctly understood the underlying intention behind this invitation: she was being considered as a potential fiancée for Felix. However, this realization only served to fuel her discontent.\nThe Ridill Kingdom already had a first prince, Lionel, who was nine years Felix's senior.\nPrince Lionel was a lively and cheerful boy, skilled in both swordsmanship and horse riding. He had even participated in dragon slaying.\nIn stark contrast, the second prince, Felix, was plagued by ill health. Aside from the occasional royal event that demanded his presence, he spent most of his time recuperating at Duke Crockford's mansion, his mother's ancestral home.\nBridget couldn't help but question how a prince whose health was so fragile, barely able to endure the rigors of palace life, could ever be considered fit to become the next king.\nAlthough Duke Crockford, Felix's maternal grandfather, held significant power and influence within the kingdom, the second prince himself lacked any substantial presence or recognition within the royal court. Whispers even circulated among some, devoid of compassion, suggesting that Felix might not even survive to adulthood.\nGiven these circumstances, Bridget felt far from delighted about being chosen as a potential fiancée for such a prince. In fact, she couldn't shake the feeling that she had been dealt an unfortunate hand.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"It is a pleasure to meet you, Prince Felix. I am Bridget Graham of the Marquis of Sheilbury. I am truly honored to have been invited here today.\"\nBridget performed the perfect curtsy as she entered the Duke of Crockford's mansion, and the duke's servants looked at her in admiration.\nDespite being only seven years old, Bridget was exceptionally beautiful, and her dress, posture, and smile were flawless. She was the epitome of a perfect young lady. In contrast, Prince Felix hung his head in shyness, nervously fidgeting with his fingers and mumbling incoherently.\nFelix's appearance bore a striking resemblance to his late mother, the beautiful Lady Eileen, and he was indeed quite handsome. His lustrous honey-blond hair and clear aquamarine eyes were as captivating as large aquamarine gemstones.\nHowever, his pale cheeks were flushed red with nervousness, his gaze remained fixed on the floor, and he gave off an overall impression of unreliability.\nHow long am I supposed to wait for His Highness's response?\nAfter a prolonged period of awkward silence, a young servant standing behind the prince whispered, \"Your Highness, remember your practice.\"\nTo think that even such a simple greeting required practice! How pathetic!\nAs Bridget watched in astonishment, Felix began his self-introduction with a face stiff with tension.\n\"I-It's nice to meet you, I'm Felix Ark Ridill, anh—\"\nHe stuttered.\nPrince Felix's face turned a flurry of colors, alternating between bright red and pale blue, as he trembled with tears in his eyes.\nThe servants standing nearby, as well as Crockford himself, who was observing the scene, all cast Felix disapproving glances.\nAmidst this atmosphere of disappointment, the servant behind Felix timidly interjected.\n\"Your Highness, why don't we show Lady Bridget to the tearoom? I've decorated it with the flowers you chose for her, so I'm sure she'll be delighted.\"\n\"Huh? But you're the one who chose those flowers…\"\n\"Your Highness…\"\nThe young prince, who had just ruined his servant's attempt to save the situation, gasped and covered his mouth with both hands.\nThe air was now filled with an overwhelming sense of disappointment.\nThe thought of this seemingly dim-witted prince potentially becoming her future husband gave Bridget a headache.\nShe initially assumed that Felix's nervousness stemmed from being watched by Crockford and the numerous servants, but even after they moved to the tearoom, Felix remained hunched over, nervously fidgeting with his fingers.\nAside from Bridget and Felix, the only other people in the tearoom were Bridget's maid and Felix's servant. Despite this, Felix remained stiff with tension, utterly unwilling to open his mouth.\nLeft with no choice, Bridget decided to initiate the conversation herself.\n\"Oh my, these flowers are absolutely lovely. Did you choose these for me? I'm so pleased. This type of rose, with petals that resemble lace, is quite popular these days. You seem to be well-informed about the latest trends, Your Highness.\"\n\"…Er, no…I…\"\n\"And this vase is exquisite. Is it from the Corminette collection? My mother adores the Corminette collection and collects it as well. She's particularly fond of the teacups…\"\n\"…Corminette collection?\"\nApparently, the prince had no idea about the significance of the vase. Seeing his patron struggling, the servant tactfully intervened.\n\"You wanted to get something that Lady Bridget would like, didn't you, Your Highness?\"\n\"Oh, yes, that's right. That's…exactly what I did.\"\nAfter saying that, Felix hung his head again. At this rate, they would never make any progress in their conversation.\nBridget forced a bright smile, saying, \"Well, I'm very happy with it,\" while inwardly feeling extremely irritated.\nShe began to suspect that the reason Crockford kept Felix away from the royal palace was not because of his ill health, but because he was too embarrassed to present him in public.\nEntertaining such unkind thoughts, Bridget turned to Felix and asked, \"May I have some of the sweets?\" in an attempt to fill the awkward silence.\nFelix nodded his head rapidly and nervously. Couldn't he at least say \"Yes, please\"?\nAs Bridget was growing increasingly exasperated, Felix's servant, speaking on his master's behalf, smoothly replied,\n\"Today's teacakes are scones with three types of jam and clotted cream. We have also prepared your preferred tea from Florendia, Lady Bridget. Please enjoy it straight first.\"\nThe tea and sweets that had been prepared were all to Bridget's liking, but she suspected that Felix had not personally arranged any of it. It was more likely the work of this seemingly thoughtful servant.\nThis is all just a charade.\nBridget suppressed her discomfort and plastered a beautiful smile on her face. However, her irritation must have affected her actions, as a drop of raspberry jam fell from her spoon and stained the bodice of her dress.\n\"Oh, no!\"\nBridget quickly covered her chest with a napkin, inwardly berating herself for her clumsiness. How could she let her emotions get the better of her and make such a blunder?\n\"My lady, pardon me.\"\nBridget's maid rushed forward and attempted to wipe the jam stain with a handkerchief, but the thin, runny jam had already seeped into the delicate white lace. The stain stood out starkly against the pale blue of her dress.\nAs Bridget was lamenting her mishap, Felix, for some inexplicable reason, suddenly yanked off the scarf from around his neck. Was he suggesting that she use it to clean the jam stain?\nJust as Bridget was about to express her confusion, Felix began to fold the blue scarf into a thin strip and roll it up tightly. Then, he removed one of his cufflinks and used it as a pin to secure a handkerchief, transforming it into a makeshift blue rose corsage.\n\"Ah, um, that is… I…\"\nFelix's face was bright red, and he was trembling with embarrassment as he held out a blue rose corsage made of a scarf and cufflinks.\n\"I-I thought…you might look nice in blue, Lady Bridget, so I…h-here you gouh—,\" he stammered, his face flushed red and his body trembling with shyness.\nHe stuttered again.\nDespite his awkwardness, Bridget couldn't bring herself to look down on this timid prince.\nShe glanced between the impromptu corsage and Felix before quietly saying, \"Thank you, I'll gladly accept it.\"\nWith hands more careful than if she were handling a fresh flower, Bridget took the corsage and pinned it over the stained area of her bodice. The deep blue corsage stood out beautifully against the light blue dress.\n\"Does it look alright?\" she asked.\n\"Y-Yes, of course!\"\n\"Good,\" she replied, a genuine smile gracing her face for the first time that day.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAs Bridget excused herself to wash her hands, she happened to see Felix and Crockford engaged in a conversation in the hallway on her way back to the tearoom. It seemed like they were having a serious discussion.\nBridget hesitated, torn between eavesdropping and pretending not to notice. Just then, she caught a snippet of Crockford's voice.\n\"…What happened to your scarf and cufflink?\"\n\"I, um, I spilled some tea and got my scarf dirty. So I took it off… And the cufflink… I'm sorry, I lost it.\"\nAs Felix fidgeted with his fingers and replied, Crockford glared at him with contempt and spat out,\n\"…You're an embarrassment to our family. Can't you even manage to dress yourself properly?\"\nBridget felt a surge of anger and was about to storm out of the hallway.\nFelix had done nothing wrong. He was merely trying to protect Bridget's reputation with a kind gesture.\nBridget almost blurted out, \"Your Highness has done nothing wrong!\"  but before she could say it, someone grabbed her arm from behind.\nIt was Felix's servant who pressed an index finger against Bridget's lips as she was about to call the person rude.\n\"Please don't let my master's kindness go to waste.\"\nBridget instinctively shook off the servant's hand. In the process, her fingertips brushed against the servant's long bangs.\n\"Oh…\"\nBridget gasped involuntarily.\nThe young boy in front of her had a handsome face, as expected of a royal servant. However, there was a scar on his face, running from his right temple down to below his eye, as if it had been made by a sharp object. His eyes seemed unharmed, but the vertical scar was deep enough that it would likely remain for the rest of his life.\nHis hair was unusually long for someone who dressed so neatly, but it seemed that he had been using it to hide the scar.\nThe servant boy adjusted his disheveled bangs with his fingers and looked down at Bridget with cold eyes.\n\"Please return to the tearoom.\"\nHis cold gaze conveyed a silent message: If you belittle my master's kindness, I will never forgive you…\nBridget fell silent for a moment before turning away from Felix and the others.\n\"I'll go back to the tearoom. Lead the way.\"\n\"As you wish.\"\nThe servant boy, as if nothing had happened, began to lead Bridget, walking ahead of her.\nBridget wondered if Felix was still being scolded by Crockford… all because he had tried to defend her. She placed a hand over the blue rose adorning her chest, feeling a deep sense of her own helplessness and inadequacy.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nFrom that day on, Bridget began to be invited to the duke's mansion as Felix's conversation partner.\nBeing a conversation partner didn't just mean chatting over tea. As the daughter of a diplomat and fluent in several languages, Bridget taught Felix the languages she had already mastered. Sometimes, she would also be his dance practice partner.\nFelix was by no means a quick learner, and his poor coordination often resulted in him stepping on Bridget's feet during dance practice. Despite this, Bridget patiently guided him through the steps, encouraging him all the while.\n\"Come on, Your Highness! You're slouching again! Straighten your back! And keep your chin up!\"\n\"Y-Yes, ma'am…\"\nWith a helpless frown and a beet-red face, Felix would do his best to follow Bridget's instructions.\nFelix Ark Liddell was clumsier, slower, and less reliable than most people.\nYet, he was also diligent, hardworking… and above all, kind.\nAs she guided Felix through his awkward dance moves, Bridget thought to herself,\nPlease try harder. You are to be my future partner… my prince.",

      "content": "\"Monica Norton, just who are you?\"\nBridget's words caused Monica's mind to freeze for a few seconds.\nShe had been found out. The fact that Monica had injured her left hand. The fact that Monica was the person Felix was searching for!\nTrying to calm her rapidly beating heart, Monica thought.\n—Just how much does Bridget know?\n—Has she figured out that Monica is the Silent Witch?\nIn any case, asking the wrong question could give her away. Monica pressed her throbbing left hand with her right hand and said in a trembling voice,\n\"…What are you talking about?\"\n\"Do you recognize this?\"\nSaying that, Bridget took something small out of her uniform pocket.\nSeeing it, Monica couldn't help but exclaim, \"Ah!\"\nBridget's fingers were pinching an amber brooch… the magical tool Monica had improvised to protect Felix before the school festival.\nSeeing Monica's reaction, Bridget narrowed her eyes and a faint smile appeared on her lips.\n\"Yes, it's the item you dropped before the school festival. It looks like an ordinary brooch, but it's actually a splendid magical tool with a magic formula embedded inside… How is it that you, who is treated so poorly by the House of Kerbeck, have such an expensive item?\"\n\"W-Well, that's… it's not that big of a deal…\"\nAfter all, it was just a cheap brooch bought from a street stall, with an auxiliary spell cast on it in about thirty minutes. [TL: Damn girl, you just broke Louis' barrier he created with great effort in roughly 5 minutes, but the brooch you spent six times more time creating is still not a big deal?]\nHowever, Bridget snorted at Monica's words.\n\"I had my servants analyze it, and it's not something anyone can do, to incorporate such a high-performance defensive enchantment into such a cheap brooch. This is an extremely expensive magical tool…\"\n\"Wh-What?\"\nMonica was unaware that her skills as one of the Seven Sages were far surpassed those of other magicians. What's more, she didn't normally come into contact with magical tools, so she was somewhat ignorant of their value. This had completely backfired on her.\n\"Why do you, who is treated so poorly by the Kelbeck Counts, possess such an expensive magical tool?\"\nI'm sorry, that's not true, it only took me thirty minutes to make it…!\nUnable to answer honestly, Monica's gaze wandered, and Bridget pressed further.\n\"I've always wondered why a girl like you, who seems so out of place at Serendia Academy, is always around His Highness. So I thought, could it be that you're His Highness's chosen bodyguard? If that were the case, it would explain why a girl like you was suddenly appointed to the student council, and why you have a magical tool with a defensive enchantment.\"\nHowever, Bridget didn't seem convinced by her own reasoning. Bridget squinted her amber eyes and put a finger to her temple.\n\"…But if you were the bodyguard chosen by His Highness, that would mean that the House of Kerbeck is connected to His Highness… that's just too unnatural. The Count of Kerbeck is the most powerful military force in the eastern region… Even His Highness… Even Duke Crockford wouldn't be able to easily ask for their cooperation.\"\nBridget's words left Monica inwardly shocked.\nN-No way, I have never thought that the House of Kerbeck is that powerful…!\n\"By the way, I heard that you were taken from the monastery by the wife of the former Count Kerbeck… Clarissa Norton, is that right?\"\nWhat Bridget meant was the \"Monica Norton\" setting that Louis Miller had come up with. It wasn't something she was hiding, and indeed, if someone asked her, that was how she would answer…\nBut I didn't even know the wife of the former Count's name… Why does she know so much?\nSensing Monica's wariness, Bridget smiled.\n\"What's the name of the monastery you were at?\"\n\"…Huh?\"\n\"If you lived there since you were a child, you wouldn't have forgotten, would you?\"\nIt wasn't that she didn't remember, it was more that she hadn't thought of such a detailed setting.\nAs Monica hesitated, Bridget continued speaking, still smiling.\n\"I had all the records of the monasteries in the Kerbeck territory investigated during the winter break. However, there was no record of a girl named Monica.\"\nIt was at this point that Monica finally realized.\nThe one who had been sniffing around Kerbeck County during the winter break was Bridget's subordinate.\n\"And so I have concluded that you must be a ‘spy sent by the House of Kerbeck.' The House of Kerbeck must want to know something about His Highness Felix. That's why you came to Serendia Academy… Am I wrong?\"\nAs Bridget pressed her for an answer, Monica struggled to find the right words to respond.\nBridget was almost certain that Monica Norton's existence was fabricated. However, she had not yet realized that Monica was the ‘Silent Witch.'\n……What would Louis do in a situation like this?\nMonica thought of the most cunning and skilled negotiator she knew.\n——\"The basics of negotiation start with understanding the other party's demands. First, you must figure out what they want.\"\nIf she continued at this rate, she would be swept away by Bridget's momentum.\nMonica swallowed hard and steeled herself before finally speaking.\n\"Your objective, Miss Bridget, what might it be?\"\nIn truth, Monica had hoped to approach the subject in a more roundabout manner, but this was the best she could manage.\nBridget frowned in displeasure, her gaze fixed on Monica.\n\"How impertinent of you to return a question with a question.\"\n\"You brought me here for a reason… didn't you? You must have something… you want me to do…\"\nAs she spoke, Monica looked straight at Bridget, though inwardly she was thinking, ‘I wish I could look away. She's so scary…'\nThey held each other's gaze for several tens of seconds before Bridget finally looked away.\n\"To put it bluntly, I couldn't care less about your true identity. I only investigated because it might prove useful as leverage.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"I have but one goal: to uncover a certain ‘secret' of His Highness. To that end, I require your cooperation, Monica Norton.\"\nMonica was taken aback by this unexpected turn of events.\n\"The prince's secret? What… what do you mean?\"\n\"I'll tell you once you've sworn to assist me.\"\nMonica was confused.\nWhat secret of Felix's could Bridget possibly be after?\nTo be honest, there were many things about Felix that puzzled Monica, so she couldn't deny her curiosity.\nHowever, she couldn't simply agree without careful consideration. After all, she was tasked with protecting Felix.\n\"I-If I don't cooperate… you'll expose… my true identity… i-is that it?\"\n\"If I could do that, it would be simple. But to be perfectly honest, I don't have the power to make enemies of the House of Kerbeck. This matter has nothing to do with my House of Sheilbury. It's something I wish to know for purely personal reasons.\"\nIt was only now that Monica understood why Louis had sought the cooperation of the House of Kerbeck for this mission.\nThe Kerbecks were not merely a family of flamboyant actors. They were a formidable noble house that even the likes of Duke Crockford and Marquis Sheilbury hesitated to cross.\nMonica was reminded once again that not all counts were necessarily inferior to dukes or marquises.\nLady Bridget is acting solely out of personal interest, so she doesn't want to antagonize the House of Kerbeck… If I pretend to be acting on their orders, maybe I can get out of this…\nJust as Monica began to entertain a glimmer of hope that she might be able to extricate herself from this predicament, Bridget spoke, her eyes on Monica's left hand.\n\"His Highness is currently searching for a petite young lady with an injured left hand. And you've been hiding that fact, haven't you? Or am I mistaken?\"\nCaught off guard, Monica's shoulders twitched, and Bridget immediately pressed on.\n\"I don't know what this ‘young lady with an injured left hand' signifies or why His Highness is looking for her, but you clearly wish to keep it a secret from him, don't you?\"\n\"That's… that's…\"\nAs Monica stammered, Bridget raised a single finger and pointed it sharply at her.\n\"One week.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"I'll give you one week to convince His Highness to abandon his search for this ‘young lady with an injured left hand.' In return, you will cooperate with me.\"\nFaced with this sudden exchange of conditions, Monica could only feel bewildered. But if she refused and Felix learned that ‘Monica Norton' had an injured left hand, it would be the end of her. So, she cautiously asked, \"…Can you really do that?\"\n\"Who do you take me for? In the realm of social intrigue, few can match my prowess.\"\nWith those words, Bridget used the tip of her folded fan to lift Monica's chin and smiled charmingly.",

      "content": "The symptoms of mana exhaustion are said to be similar to anemia. Your whole body gets cold, your head feels heavy, and you have no strength in your body.\nGlenn, who has more mana than most people, has rarely experienced mana exhaustion. However, there was one time when he clearly ran out of mana and collapsed just like now. That was when he lost control of his magic in Minerva.\nThat time too, it was a magic duel with Hubert… No, what happened that time can't be called a magic duel. Glenn could do nothing but run away.\nThe current Glenn is different from that time… but in the end, he lost again.\nIt's frustrating…\nFor Monica's sake, he had to win this fight.\n\"……I wonder what happened to the outcome of the duel.\"\nAs Glenn stirs in bed, a familiar voice comes from above.\n\"It was a draw.\"\nGlenn jolts up in bed in shock.\nSitting by the bedside, nibbling on dried meat and sipping from a wine bottle, is his mentor, Louis Miller.\n\"Why are you here, Master!?\"\n\"Who do you think has been maintaining the barrier for this magic duel?\"\nApparently, Louis was asked by his teacher, MacLegan, to come all the way here to maintain the barrier for the magic duel. In other words, Louis had seen all of Glenn's disgrace. Glenn dejectedly slumps his shoulders and looks up at Louis with a sidelong glance.\n\"I lost to that guy again…\"\nIn front of his depressed disciple, Louis briefly chants a spell and lights a fire at his fingertips. While lightly roasting the dried meat, Louis says in a casual tone, as if it were an afterthought.\n\"Last time, it was just a brat who took life for granted and lost control of his magic. This time, it was a pure defeat after giving it your all. Make sure you understand the difference. Otherwise, you'll miss the point of reflecting on your mistakes.\"\n\"Yes…\"\n\"It wasn't bad that you held back and didn't use the pursuit technique from the beginning. You've grown, haven't you?\"\nLouis extinguished the fire at his fingertips and thrust the sizzling dried meat into Glenn's mouth. Apparently, this dried meat was a gift for Glenn's visit. Glenn chews on the dried meat, secretly thinking that it's strange for Louis to be using it as a snack for his wine.\n\"By the way, what do you mean by a draw?\"\n\"The magic tool that Hubert Dee brought with him malfunctioned. This magic duel is a draw.\"\nFor the time being, it seems that there is no need to worry about Monica being taken away by Hubert right away. Glenn, who had been concerned about his friend, breathed a sigh of relief and chewed on the dried meat. After all, there's nothing like meat when you're tired.\n\"Ah, that's good… Monica was going to be taken away by that senior because of my loss, you see. Oh, Monica is my friend.\"\n\"Oh?\"\nGlenn, unaware that Louis was inwardly clicking his tongue at the thought of what that incompetent witch had done this time, looked at the wine bottle that his mentor was holding in one hand.\n\"By the way, Master… I don't think it's a good idea to bring alcohol into the infirmary.\"\n\"Aren't rubbing alcohol and drinking alcohol both alcohol?\"\n\"If you said that in front of Mrs. Rosalie, you'd definitely get scolded.\" (TL: She's Louis' wife)\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"Mmm, mm, mm, mmm~\"\nDespite having run out of magic once, Hubert walked down the hallway with his usual attitude, his hands in his pockets.\nIn this magic duel, Hubert's magic tool had malfunctioned, and he had insisted that it was a lie. As a result, Hubert's reputation had plummeted, but he didn't seem to care. He was the type of person who was indifferent to the opinions of others.\nAbove all, he was in an extremely good mood.\nThe prey he had been chasing after a few years ago was still alive… No, she had become even stronger than before.\nWho would have thought that she would jump into the hunting ground on her own?\nWhen Monica was in Minerva, she had always run away from Hubert, crying and sobbing. And now, that same Monica had willingly jumped into the magic duel and confronted him! What's more, she had directed her anger at Hubert!\nAhh, that's great… That cold, expressionless face of hers, it's so tempting every time I remember it.\nThinking back, when Monica was in Minerva, she had always been alone, holed up in her laboratory, and had never tried to interact with anyone other than her teachers.\nBut now, Monica was surrounded by friends. She was attached to a place called the Student Council. That attachment was what drove Monica.\nIf I were to completely destroy the things she's attached to… Ahh, I wonder if I'll be able to see that merciless, cruel queen again. I'd like to try destroying one of them right in front of Monica's eyes.\nFor example, the man standing in front of him right now, Cyril Ashley.\n\"Stop, Hubert Dee.\"\nWith those words, Cyril began a shortened incantation.\nAn ice arrow was precisely aimed at Hubert's forehead. Despite the fact that the magic duel had just ended and he must have hardly any magic left, Cyril had already recovered enough to use magic.\nThinking that he was quite impressive, Hubert smirked.\n\"Mmm mmm mmm~, don't worry, I won't force Monica to do anything.\"\n\"You're not trustworthy.\"\n\"Seriously… For now.\"\nOnce he was ready to hunt again, he could destroy this man in front of Monica as an example. Alternatively, it might not be a bad idea to obediently follow that merciless queen and wait for an opportunity to sink his teeth into her throat.\nAhh, this is fun. I thought Serendia Academy was a stuck-up school and that it would be boring, but now there are so many fun things to do.\nCyril watched Hubert, who was grinning, with a look of disgust, but then he muttered something.\n\"Do you know something… about the Silent Witch?\"\n\"Mmm mmm mmm~, what are you talking about?\"\n\"In the middle of that fog… I heard you blurted out the name of the Silent Witch.\"\nI see. This man, who recovered quickly, must have remained conscious during the magic duel.\nEven so, it seems that he hasn't reached the conclusion that the Silent Witch is Monica Norton.\nHubert approached Cyril, bent down his waist to look into his face, and said,\n\"Obviously, it's a s-e-c-r-e-t. If you want to find out, let's have another magic duel.\"\n\"You're sickening. Don't get so close to my face.\"\nAs Cyril wrinkled his nose and groaned, Hubert doubled over with laughter.\nShe may not be as good as Monica, but this man seems like he could be a good plaything as well.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nFreed from Bridget, Monica returned to her attic room and immediately collapsed onto her bed.\n\"Nero…\"\nWhen she called out to Nero, who was sleeping in the basket by her pillow, she heard a happy, meowing snore in response. It was a snore that was hard to believe came from a dragon.\n\"Lady Bridget found out about a lot of things… She doesn't know that I'm the Silent Witch, though…\"\nBridget seemed to think that Monica was a \"spy for the House of Kerbeck.\"\nHowever, it was true that Bridget had discovered that Monica was not an ordinary person. Above all, she had learned about her left-hand injury.\n\"What does Lady Bridget want me to do for her…?\"\nBridget had said that there was a \"secret about His Highness\" that she absolutely had to know. And she wanted Monica to help her with that.\nI'm also curious about His Highness' secret, though…\nWhy does he obey the Duke of Crockford?\nDoes he know that the Duke of Crockford is involved in the Cursed Dragon incident?\nDoes Felix know that the Duke of Crockford may have been involved in the death of Monica's father?\nThere were too many questions to count.\nShould I tell Louis about this? No, but when it comes to His Highness's secrets… I feel like it's better not to say anything.\nLouis was a man who openly declared that he disliked both the Duke of Crockford and the second prince. Moreover, he seemed to hold a grudge against Felix for breaking the magic tool he had worked so hard to create in just three days.\nIf Louis were to learn about Felix's secrets or weaknesses, it was obvious that he would use them with glee.\nSpeaking of which, Lynn hasn't come by even once since the new semester started… She used to come much more often…\nMonica was wondering if she was busy because her wife, Mrs. Rosalie, was close to her due date when she heard a tapping sound on the window.\nWondering if it was Lynn, Monica turned her eyes to the window and widened her eyes. Perched on the windowsill was a black cat. It looked a lot like Nero, but this cat had only white color on its tail and the tips of its paws. A letter with a rose emblem was tied around its collar. The cat also had a small cloth bag on its back. A carrot was sticking out of the bag.\nWhen it came to a rose emblem and vegetables, there was only one person who came to mind—the Thorn Witch, Raul Roseburg.\nMonica opened the window and let the cat in, then untied the letter that was attached to it and spread it open. The letter was written in bold letters.\n‘Yo, Monica, how's it going? I'm doing great!\nSo, listen, I invited Ray to my place the other day. We harvested vegetables together!\nRay said the sunlight was too bright and he was melting, so I told him he was like an earthworm! …When I said that, he put a curse on me that made bugs swarm me, man, I was surprised. Don't you think it would be great if we could use that curse to make something like a bug repellent? Oh, and we could also use it to gather bees to pollinate fruits.\nI'll have my familiar bring you some of the vegetables I harvested with Ray. The cabbages came out really well this year, and I really wanted you to try them, but my familiar can't carry cabbages, so I brought you carrots instead.\nCome visit me sometime, Monica. I'll make you some of my special cabbage soup!\nOh, by the way, the Sheffield festival is coming up soon, right? Around that time, I'm going to be working on replanting the Duke of Crockford's garden.\nIsn't this a chance to infiltrate the Duke of Crockford's mansion and expose his evil deeds?\nRay says he's sick of gardening and won't go, but will you come, Monica?\nI'll bring a few of my servants with me when I go to replant, so if you blend in with them, I think you can infiltrate without revealing your identity.\nLet's go undercover together!\nFrom the Thorn Witch, Raul Rosenberg'\nJust like that, she had been invited to go on an undercover mission as if she were being invited to a party. But this was a chance to investigate the Duke of Crockford.\nThe Sheffield festival mentioned in the letter was exactly one month from now, a day to celebrate the Wind Spirit King bringing the winds of spring. Serendia Academy would also be closed for three days, including that day.\nAfter reading the letter once more, Monica sat down at her writing desk and wrote a reply, asking to be taken along on the undercover mission.",

      "content": "Bridget brought Monica to the most luxurious private tea room at Serendia Academy.\nThe table was already set with dishes, so Bridget must have prepared this room in advance… in other words, she had no intention of letting Monica escape.\nA maid accompanied Bridget in the room, but after pouring tea into their cups, she left without saying anything. Now they were alone in the room.\n\"Please enjoy the tea first. It's the first harvest of Florendia.\"\n\"Um, Lady Bridget, what is the ‘secret of His Highness' that you want to know? What do you want me to help with?\"\nWhen Monica asked directly, Bridget took a sip of tea and sighed.\n\"It's a vulgar way of speaking to get to the point without preamble. It lacks refinement.\"\nSaying that, Brigitte looked at the flowers arranged in a vase. Monica followed her gaze and looked at the flowers too.\nThe flowers were yellow roses with delicate petals like lace. It was not something easily obtainable this season.\nMonica had learned in the past six months that the sense and wealth of the host were judged by the flowers and tea utensils arranged at the tea ceremony.\n\"Let's enjoy the tea party by admiring the flowers and teacups, and enjoying black tea, while you listen to my story.\"\nMonica, who was not good at indirect expressions and probing, wanted her to get to the point quickly, but it seemed that Bridget had something on her mind.\nAs Monica silently took a sip of tea, Bridget smiled lightly and spoke.\n\"What do you think of Prince Felix?\"\n\"Huh?\"\nMonica let out a dumbfounded voice at the sudden question. If it were Monica from a while ago, she would have answered, \"I think he's amazing with his face and body in perfect proportion.\" But now, Monica had too many thoughts about Felix and couldn't put them into words.\n\"To be honest, I don't really know.\"\nAt first glance, Felix was a charming prince who was well-liked and capable. But everyone knows that he is a puppet of Duke Crockford. Furthermore, Monica knows that he used to call himself \"Eig\" and secretly engage in night activities and that he is a big fan of the Silent Witch.\n…There are too many different sides to him, and Monica doesn't know which one is the real him.\nBridget responded to Monica's ambiguous answer with a short \"I see,\" and her gaze fell to the cup in her hand.\n\"If you had said that he is a perfect prince who is good at studying, sports, popular with people, and skilled in conversation, this conversation would have ended here, and I wouldn't have asked for your help.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nWhen Monica looked at her with a surprised face, Bridget closed her eyes for a moment and then slowly opened them.\n\"He is frail, a crybaby, not good at studying or sports, below average in everything he does. Above all, he is extremely shy and timid in front of others.\"\nCould it be that she is talking about herself… Monica wondered, and Bridget continued.\n\"…That's the Felix I know.\"\nFor a moment, Monica couldn't understand the meaning of those words.\nFelix is below average in everything he does? Not good at speaking in front of others?\nMonica couldn't hide her confusion, and Bridget started speaking with a slightly distant look in her eyes.\n\"I first met His Highness when I was seven years old. My first impression of him was that he was ‘unreliable and unsightly.' He could barely greet me. He couldn't look me in the eye. He just kept looking down and fidgeting.\"\nBridget's story sounded more and more like Monica's herself. It didn't feel like she was talking about Felix at all.\n\"He worked harder than anyone in his studies and sports. Yet, he couldn't reach the level of an average person. He would cry and say, ‘I'm sorry for not meeting expectations even though I'm a royal…' He was really timid, weak, and uncool… but… he was kinder than anyone.\"\nWhen Bridget uttered the last words, her perfectly beautiful face seemed slightly tinged with sadness. Just by looking at her face, one could easily imagine the feelings she had for Felix.\n\"I thought no one believed he could become king. I thought so too. But… I thought he would be the one I wanted to be with, even if he couldn't become king.\"\nIt was her first love, and her voice murmured softly, tinged with a hint of loneliness.\nWhen you see her face, you can easily imagine the feelings she had for Felix.\n\"Everyone simply assumed he wouldn't make it as king. I also thought so. But… somehow, I knew he was the one I wanted to spend my life with.\"\nShe murmured softly, \"He was my first love,\" sounding somewhat lonely.\nMonica was speechless at the sight of the perfect young lady expressing her emotions.\nFurthermore, Monica, who couldn't understand love, didn't even know what words to say.\n\"…I was looking forward to the day I could meet His Highness. But, about ten years ago, His Highness fell seriously ill… and we couldn't meet for over a year.\"\nAccording to Bridget, Felix was a weak boy in his early childhood. He was frail and would get a fever whenever the seasons changed.\nThat's why Bridget, upon hearing that Felix had a serious illness, was extremely worried.\nShe spent over a year in anxiety without even being allowed to visit him…\n\"I was so relieved when His Highness's illness finally recovered. But when I went to see him… he had changed into a completely different person.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nFelix was always a shy boy who would blush when facing Bridget. Yet, when they reunited, the boy kissed the back of Bridget's hand with a graceful gesture and said:\n\"It's been a while. It's good to see you, Bridget. You've gotten even more beautiful since I last saw you a year ago.\"\nIf a girl heard such words from her first love, most of them would have their hearts flutter. But instead, Bridget felt a strong sense of unease. The boy in front of her was undoubtedly Felix Ark Ridill. He had grown taller after not seeing him for over a year, but there was no way she could mistake that face. However, Bridget felt a terrible sense of discomfort and even nausea.\n──Who are you?\nSuch words crossed her mind. But this was the Duke of Crocford's residence. Moreover, no matter how close they were, the other person was a royal. Such impolite remarks would never be allowed.\nBridget closed her eyes to the unease and continued interacting with Felix as before.\nThe Felix she met again after a long time had become adept at both studying and sports. He could now effortlessly lead a lady in a dance that he used to be so bad at, and his manners and escorting were perfect. His behavior was dignified, and everyone agreed that he was a prince suitable to be the next king.\nNevertheless, Bridget couldn't accept\nthat\nFelix.\n─No, no, no, he is not my prince!\nWith her naturally beautiful appearance inherited from her mother, Bridget quickly became the center of attention among the ladies in high society. To the noble ladies surrounding her, Felix spewed sweet words with a gentle smile. Furthermore, he made his diplomatic debut in his early teens, attracting attention from those around him.\nIt was around this time that the domestic nobles began to divide into the first prince faction and the second prince faction.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"The prince I knew was an introverted, shy prince who couldn't even have a proper conversation with a girl.\"\nBridget's description of the \"old image of the prince\" didn't sound like a compliment.\nHowever, when Bridget spoke about the old Felix, her voice sounded like that of a girl talking about her beloved, and there was a hint of excitement.\nBut suddenly, Bridget's tone dropped.\n\"…And yet, he became such a shallow and frivolous man who casually spouts empty poems… How much have I endured, listening to those sickeningly sweet words?\"\nThe delicate fan in Bridget's hand creaked and made an eerie sound.

It was a statement that could even lead to charges of disrespect and execution without complaint.\nWith a trembling voice, Bridget revealed:\n\"I want to meet the real Prince Felix.\"\nThe claim that Felix attending this academy is an impostor is simply too ridiculous. No one would believe such an assertion.\nBut Monica knows. She knows that Felix has a hidden side. That he is hiding something. Above all, Monica has always felt a sense of unease about him having a middle name derived from the Earth Spirit King while his dominant attribute is water.\n…Could he be a double?\nMonica couldn't just dismiss this absurd story with laughter.\nThe words Eig said in the pleasure district flashed through Monica's mind.\n──I must become a king.\nWhat was the true meaning behind those words? If Eig is indeed a double… How did he feel when he uttered those words?\nPressing down on her pounding heart through her clothes, Monica spoke in a hoarse voice.\n\"…If he is a double… Where do you think the real Prince Felix is?\"\n\"I believe that the real Prince Felix is still secretly recuperating at the Duke of Crockford's residence because he was weak of body.\nThe Duke of Crockford's mansion. It is the mansion where Monica plans to infiltrate in a month.\nIf there really is a genuine second prince at the Duke of Crockford's mansion… If Bridget's words are true, what will happen to Eig when that is exposed?\n\"…Lady Bridget, if we knew the current Prince Felix is a fake… Do you want to expose it publicly?\"\n\"If that happens, Prince Felix's reputation will plummet, won't it?\"\nYes, just as Bridget said, Felix Ark Ridill will lose his position in high society. In the worst case, both Eig and Monica could be charged with deceiving members of the royal family.\nBridget seemed to understand that as well.\n\"I don't want to expose the truth publicly… I just want to meet my prince.\"\nMonica questioned herself.\nWhat should she do… and what does she want?\nRevealing Eig's secret will surely not be beneficial for her. He probably doesn't want Monica to know the truth.\n…But still, I want to know.\nThe reason why he laughed and happily called Monica his nightlife friend, and yet sometimes showed a lonely expression as if he had given up on something.\n…I want to know more about him.\nThis is probably the first time Monica has felt this way about someone.\nAnd also, the first time she takes a step forward on her own.\n\"Lady Bridget, I…\"\nJust as Monica was about to speak, the tearoom door was knocked, and the hurried voice of Bridget's maid could be heard.\n\"I apologize, My Lady. Prince Felix is… Ah!\"\nBefore the maid could finish speaking, the door opened. The cold air from the hallway rushed into the tea room, slightly lowering the room's temperature.\n\"Hey there, you two. Mind if I join the tea party?\"\nStanding there was a person in the midst of swirling beauty, smiling gracefully.\nIt was Felix Ark Ridill.",

      "content": "At that moment, Monica turned pale when Felix visited the tearoom, but Bridget didn't change her expression and greeted Felix with a bright smile.\n\"Oh my, it's rare for Your Highness to visit the tearoom.\"\n\"I think the rare thing is this combination. Since when did you two become so close that you're having tea together?\"\n\"Why, we're both student council members. There's nothing strange about it, is there?\"\nThe conversation between the handsome man and the beautiful woman, who were the pride of the academy, was a very picturesque sight.\nHowever, Monica couldn't help but feel her palms sweating at the mind games going on behind the scenes.\nTh-this is amazing…\nIf she were to interrupt, she might accidentally reveal something. Monica silently watched the exchange between the two.\n\"The student council meeting is coming up soon, isn't it? I'd like to give you a little lecture for that.\"\n\"Oh, when Monica was invited to the club president's tea party, it was decided that you would accompany her.\"\n\"Yes, we were discussing the arrangements for that.\"\nMonica was simply impressed by Bridget's smooth excuses. If it were Monica, she would have either come up with a nonsensical excuse or hesitated and stammered.\nFelix shifted his gaze from Bridget to Monica and smiled pleasantly.\n\"Are you prepared for dealing with the club presidents?\"\n\"Y-yes, well, um…\"\nAs expected, Monica hesitated, and Bridget covered her mouth with her fan and chuckled.\n\"Honestly, before we even get to dealing with the club presidents, there's a problem with your etiquette. Miss Norton, did you not take the tea party lessons seriously?\"\nMonica flinched when Bridget gave her a cold stare.\n\"H-h-h-how h-horrible of m-m-me…\"\n\"I'll thoroughly teach you tea party etiquette for a while. Be prepared.\"\nOh, well done. Monica was impressed inwardly.\nIf she were told this way, it wouldn't be unnatural for Bridget to invite Monica to a tea party in the future.\nIsabelle, who plays the role of the villainess, is quite a good actress, but Bridget's acting is even more natural.\nIn these situations, Monica can't help but be impressed by how intelligent she is. At least it's something Monica could never do.\nAcross from the carefree Monica, Felix was looking at Bridget with a wry smile.\n\"Your guidance sounds strict. How about I help out as a guest if you're practicing for a tea party?\"\n\"We're not at a stage where we can show it to Your Highness yet. I don't like to show half-baked results.\"\nFelix smiled gently at Bridget, who implied that he should leave.\n\"The most important thing in a tea party is to enjoy the conversation, isn't it? Don't you think it would be easier if you had someone to talk to?\"\nHow many people could refuse when the student council president, who is at the top of this academy, says so with a gentle smile?\nIf it were Monica, she would have definitely been won over by that smile.\nHowever, Bridget covered her mouth with her fan and giggled.\n\"Oh no, Your Highness. Girls' talk is supposed to be a secret from men.\"\n\"Something you can't tell me?\"\n\"Yes, like who we're interested in.\"\nBridget narrowed her eyes slightly and lifted her lips seductively.\nIt was the kind of smile that would make most men stagger under her charm.\nTh-this is amazing… It's like a sparkling smile showdown…\nMonica couldn't help but wonder what a smile showdown was, but when she saw Felix and Bridget interacting, that was the word that came to her mind.\nBoth Felix and Bridget know how to use their beauty well.\nSandwiched between the two of them, the plain Monica could only blend into the background.\nHowever, Felix would always give a brilliant smile even to such a background character.\n\"Someone you're interested in? …Monica, is there someone you're interested in?\"\n\"Huh!?\"\nMonica, who was suddenly asked a question, let out a strange cry and started sweating profusely.\nH-h-how should I answer this? What is \"someone I'm interested in\"? The person I'm most interested in right now is His Highness, who is full of secrets. There's no way I can say thaaaat!\nAs Monica was holding her head in her hands, Bridget smiled and chuckled.\n\"She was telling me about the time I first got flowers from a boy.\"\nBridget traced the yellow rose arranged in the vase and looked at Felix with a meaningful gaze.\n\"Your Highness, do you remember the color of the flower you first gave me when we were young?\"\nBridget was testing Felix Ark Ridill, who was in front of her.\nHow would Felix respond? Would he pretend to have forgotten or…?\nIn front of Monica, who was holding her breath in suspense, Felix took out a white handkerchief from his pocket.\nA handkerchief? What is he going to do with a handkerchief?\nFelix folded the handkerchief thinly, rolled it up, and shaped it into a rose, then handed it to Bridget.\n\"Unfortunately, I only have a white handkerchief with me now… Ah, after all, blue suits you best.\"\nMonica couldn't tell if this was the right or wrong answer. However, since she saw Bridget pursing her lips in regret under her fan, perhaps this was the correct answer.\nBridget immediately smiled brightly and accepted the white rose made of the handkerchief.\n\"Oh, you remembered? I'm glad.\"\n\"It's better made than before, isn't it?\"\n\"Yes, it's very well made. Your Highness has always been skillful.\"\n\"Not really, I just practiced a lot when I was little.\"\nTo an outsider, it was a heartwarming conversation reminiscing about the past. However, Monica could feel the intense battle of nerves going on beneath the surface.\nBridget was deliberately bringing up their childhood, waiting for him to make a mistake.\nAs Monica held her breath, watching how this battle would unfold, Cyril's voice calling out to Felix came from the hallway.\n\"Your Highness, are you here? There's an urgent matter I need to confirm…\"\nFelix turned his gaze toward the door and shrugged his shoulders, looking slightly disappointed.\n\"I'd like to be invited to the next tea party as well.\"\n\"When Miss Norton acquires the manners of an average person, I'll be happy to.\"\nWith that exchange, Felix left the tearoom.\nListening to the sound of the door closing with a thud, Monica let out a deep breath even though she hadn't done anything.\n\"H-He sure is a smooth talker, as always.\"\nBridget crushed the rose made of a white handkerchief and muttered spitefully. Still, why is it that the angry face of a beautiful woman has such power?\n\"It's frustrating, but it seems that man has thoroughly investigated His Highness's childhood.\"\n\"Ah, um, if that person the real Highness, and because of an illness… or something like that, his personality changed or something like that…\"\n\"What kind of pathogen would have to get into his head for that innocent Highness to start spreading cold words and smiles?\"\n\"…\"\nIt seemed that Bridget had a stronger aversion to the current Felix Ark Ridill than Monica had thought.\nAfter a moment of hesitation, Monica opened her mouth.\n\"Ah, um, well. I'm planning to infiltrate the Duke of Crockford's mansion on Sheffield's festival day.\"\n\"What did you say?\"\n\"…If you know anything about the inside of the Duke of Crockford's mansion, Lady Bridget, could you tell me?\"\nIf, as Bridget had deduced, the real Prince Felix was in the Duke of Crockford's mansion, then the more information they had about the inside of the mansion, the better.\nThat was the intention behind her suggestion, but Bridget pressed Monica and said something unexpected.\n\"Take me with you.\"\n\"Wha…?\"\n\"I'm saying that I will also infiltrate the Duke of Crockford's mansion.\"\n\"Eh, whaaaat!?\"\nMonica almost fell out of her chair.\nThis lady, who seemed like the epitome of a sheltered young lady, would infiltrate on her own? That was ridiculous.\n\"Ah, ah, um, the infiltration is, well, we're going to blend in as gardeners, so Lady Bridget…\"\n\"If I can meet the real His Highness, I don't care if I have to pretend to be a gardener, a groom, or a traveling performer.\"\nEven after that, Monica tried to persuade Bridget with all her might, even though her words were clumsy. However, she was unable to persuade Bridget, who had made up her mind to meet the real prince.\nOn that day, Monica learned firsthand just how terrifying the power of a girl in love can be.",

      "content": "Bridget brought Monica to the most luxurious private tea room at Serendia Academy.\nThe table was already set with dishes, so Bridget must have prepared this room in advance… in other words, she had no intention of letting Monica escape.\nA maid accompanied Bridget in the room, but after pouring tea into their cups, she left without saying anything. Now they were alone in the room.\n\"Please enjoy the tea first. It's the first harvest of Florendia.\"\n\"Um, Lady Bridget, what is the ‘secret of His Highness' that you want to know? What do you want me to help with?\"\nWhen Monica asked directly, Bridget took a sip of tea and sighed.\n\"It's a vulgar way of speaking to get to the point without preamble. It lacks refinement.\"\nSaying that, Brigitte looked at the flowers arranged in a vase. Monica followed her gaze and looked at the flowers too.\nThe flowers were yellow roses with delicate petals like lace. It was not something easily obtainable this season.\nMonica had learned in the past six months that the sense and wealth of the host were judged by the flowers and tea utensils arranged at the tea ceremony.\n\"Let's enjoy the tea party by admiring the flowers and teacups, and enjoying black tea, while you listen to my story.\"\nMonica, who was not good at indirect expressions and probing, wanted her to get to the point quickly, but it seemed that Bridget had something on her mind.\nAs Monica silently took a sip of tea, Bridget smiled lightly and spoke.\n\"What do you think of Prince Felix?\"\n\"Huh?\"\nMonica let out a dumbfounded voice at the sudden question. If it were Monica from a while ago, she would have answered, \"I think he's amazing with his face and body in perfect proportion.\" But now, Monica had too many thoughts about Felix and couldn't put them into words.\n\"To be honest, I don't really know.\"\nAt first glance, Felix was a charming prince who was well-liked and capable. But everyone knows that he is a puppet of Duke Crockford. Furthermore, Monica knows that he used to call himself \"Eig\" and secretly engage in night activities and that he is a big fan of the Silent Witch.\n…There are too many different sides to him, and Monica doesn't know which one is the real him.\nBridget responded to Monica's ambiguous answer with a short \"I see,\" and her gaze fell to the cup in her hand.\n\"If you had said that he is a perfect prince who is good at studying, sports, popular with people, and skilled in conversation, this conversation would have ended here, and I wouldn't have asked for your help.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nWhen Monica looked at her with a surprised face, Bridget closed her eyes for a moment and then slowly opened them.\n\"He is frail, a crybaby, not good at studying or sports, below average in everything he does. Above all, he is extremely shy and timid in front of others.\"\nCould it be that she is talking about herself… Monica wondered, and Bridget continued.\n\"…That's the Felix I know.\"\nFor a moment, Monica couldn't understand the meaning of those words.\nFelix is below average in everything he does? Not good at speaking in front of others?\nMonica couldn't hide her confusion, and Bridget started speaking with a slightly distant look in her eyes.\n\"I first met His Highness when I was seven years old. My first impression of him was that he was ‘unreliable and unsightly.' He could barely greet me. He couldn't look me in the eye. He just kept looking down and fidgeting.\"\nBridget's story sounded more and more like Monica's herself. It didn't feel like she was talking about Felix at all.\n\"He worked harder than anyone in his studies and sports. Yet, he couldn't reach the level of an average person. He would cry and say, ‘I'm sorry for not meeting expectations even though I'm a royal…' He was really timid, weak, and uncool… but… he was kinder than anyone.\"\nWhen Bridget uttered the last words, her perfectly beautiful face seemed slightly tinged with sadness. Just by looking at her face, one could easily imagine the feelings she had for Felix.\n\"I thought no one believed he could become king. I thought so too. But… I thought he would be the one I wanted to be with, even if he couldn't become king.\"\nIt was her first love, and her voice murmured softly, tinged with a hint of loneliness.\nWhen you see her face, you can easily imagine the feelings she had for Felix.\n\"Everyone simply assumed he wouldn't make it as king. I also thought so. But… somehow, I knew he was the one I wanted to spend my life with.\"\nShe murmured softly, \"He was my first love,\" sounding somewhat lonely.\nMonica was speechless at the sight of the perfect young lady expressing her emotions.\nFurthermore, Monica, who couldn't understand love, didn't even know what words to say.\n\"…I was looking forward to the day I could meet His Highness. But, about ten years ago, His Highness fell seriously ill… and we couldn't meet for over a year.\"\nAccording to Bridget, Felix was a weak boy in his early childhood. He was frail and would get a fever whenever the seasons changed.\nThat's why Bridget, upon hearing that Felix had a serious illness, was extremely worried.\nShe spent over a year in anxiety without even being allowed to visit him…\n\"I was so relieved when His Highness's illness finally recovered. But when I went to see him… he had changed into a completely different person.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nFelix was always a shy boy who would blush when facing Bridget. Yet, when they reunited, the boy kissed the back of Bridget's hand with a graceful gesture and said:\n\"It's been a while. It's good to see you, Bridget. You've gotten even more beautiful since I last saw you a year ago.\"\nIf a girl heard such words from her first love, most of them would have their hearts flutter. But instead, Bridget felt a strong sense of unease. The boy in front of her was undoubtedly Felix Ark Ridill. He had grown taller after not seeing him for over a year, but there was no way she could mistake that face. However, Bridget felt a terrible sense of discomfort and even nausea.\n──Who are you?\nSuch words crossed her mind. But this was the Duke of Crocford's residence. Moreover, no matter how close they were, the other person was a royal. Such impolite remarks would never be allowed.\nBridget closed her eyes to the unease and continued interacting with Felix as before.\nThe Felix she met again after a long time had become adept at both studying and sports. He could now effortlessly lead a lady in a dance that he used to be so bad at, and his manners and escorting were perfect. His behavior was dignified, and everyone agreed that he was a prince suitable to be the next king.\nNevertheless, Bridget couldn't accept\nthat\nFelix.\n─No, no, no, he is not my prince!\nWith her naturally beautiful appearance inherited from her mother, Bridget quickly became the center of attention among the ladies in high society. To the noble ladies surrounding her, Felix spewed sweet words with a gentle smile.

      "content": "Monica looked down at the expressionless chessboard, adorned with black and white squares, and moved her black knight with a flick.\nSitting across the board was Roberto Vinkel, a young man with a masculine face and black hair.\nAs Roberto moved his white queen, Monica quickly responded by moving her black bishop.\n\"Checkmate.\"\n\"…I lost.\"\nAs Roberto lowered his head, Monica, who had been emotionless until then, furrowed her brows and returned to her usual helpless expression.\nChess was a way to temporarily forget worries and anxieties. Especially with Roberto, who was the only one in this classroom who could match Monica's skills, she could immerse herself even more in the game.\nEngagements and such were troublesome topics, but even Monica didn't dislike playing chess with Roberto.\nRoberto stared intently at the pieces on the board, reflecting on the recent match.\n\"I made a mistake in my calculations this time. I came up with a new move and tried it out…but I relied too heavily on\nforte\n, and it was far from\ncantabile\n.\"\n\"…Huh?\"\n\"I should have made it more of a gentle\ncrescendo\n.\"\n\"…Um?\"\nWhy did music terms suddenly come up?\nSensing Monica's confusion, Roberto proudly explained.\n\"I was told that my words lacked musical elegance, so Senior Moulding gave me some guidance. Hence, I tried to emulate Moulding's style.\"\nMonica awkwardly moved her head and glanced at Elliot and Benjamin, who were observing the match.\nBeside Elliot, who had a distant look in his eyes, Benjamin nodded with his arms crossed.\n\"When it comes to court women, Vinkel's way of speaking is too rigid. When courting a woman, it should be more musical and graceful. Do you understand?\"\n\"U-um, sorry, I don't really understand…\"\nApologizing with a hint of embarrassment, Monica received a half-eyed response from Elliot, who rested his cheek on his hand.\n\"Don't worry, Miss Norton. I don't understand it either.\"\n\"What's important in love is grandeur and elegance! In other words,\nbrillante\n!\nGrazioso\n! Sensibility is necessary to play a melody that resonates with a lady's heart!\"\nAs Benjamin passionately waved his flaxen hair, Roberto took out a notebook from somewhere and wrote down Benjamin's words verbatim. He was so earnest.\nTo be honest, Monica couldn't understand a single thing Benjamin was saying, but the word \"love\" reminded her of Bridget.\nBridget said she loved Felix when they were young.\nJust…wanting to see him, with a pained expression.\nThe fact that Bridget, who was always dignified and noble, had shown such a face had a considerable impact on Monica.\nShe couldn't forget that sad profile of Bridget back then.\n\"…Love… doesn't seem…fun, to me.\"\nAs Monica murmured to herself, Elliot and Benjamin simultaneously raised their heads and stared at her. It must have been quite rare for Monica to mention the word \"love.\"\n\"Hoho, I see…\"\nFor some reason, Elliot smiled knowingly, and Benjamin pushed his hair back and spoke.\n\"Of course, love should be enjoyed in a grand and elegant, musical way. But sometimes, it can be heartbreaking, igniting jealousy towards others, and even tragic when fate separates you! Ah, even the conflicting desires one feels for a beloved person! Everything is both ugly and beautiful. Do you understand, Miss Norton!\"\n\"…Um, so, is love ugly… or beautiful?\"\n\"It can be both ugly and beautiful! These two can coexist!\"\n\"W-wait, I don't really understand…could you explain it using equations?\"\nBetween Benjamin, who always tried to relate everything to music, and Monica, who tried to comprehend things through equations, there was a deep divide. This gap would probably never be filled, not in this lifetime.\nAs Monica held her head, feeling dizzy, Elliot's drooping eyes narrowed even further, giving Monica a mischievous expression.\n\"So, Miss Norton, have you finally become aware of such things… Well, I've thought so since the school festival.\"\n\"…Huh? No, I'm not talking about myself\"\n\"I think that love between people of different social classes is not a good thing. If you're a noble, you should marry a suitable wife.\"\n\"O-Ooh…\"\nMonica tilted her head, wondering what they meant by love between people of different social classes.\nElliot mentioned something about it happening during the school festival, but Monica couldn't recall any such event.\nPerplexed, Monica looked at Elliot, who had a know-it-all expression on his face.\n\"People who recklessly cross the boundaries of social class usually end up in a bad situation. Most stories in the world are tragedies, aren't they?\"\n\"Elliot! It's your stubborn mindset that creates the tragedy of love between people of different social classes! Oh, but it's also a fact that the tragedy is beautiful because of the barrier of social class! Tragedies create beautiful music even when the individuals involved don't desire it. How cruel is that?\"\nBenjamin forcefully argued, spitting as he spoke, and eventually looked up at the ceiling with a pained expression on his face.\nElliot shrugged his shoulders and gave Monica a cynical smile.\n\"Well, Miss Norton is technically the adopted daughter of the former Countess Kerbeck. If she acquires the appropriate education, it's not entirely impossible… since she's also an adopted child.\"\nWho is he talking about? Monica became even more confused, and Benjamin widened his eyes, staring intently at Elliot.\n\"I'm surprised. Elliot, your mind has become quite flexible. You used to be so fixated on social class.\"\n\"…Not really. I just thought they, as former commoners, looked good together.\"\nMonica thought to herself, wondering whose story they were talking about.\n\"I'm sorry… I still don't really understand love…\"\nAs Monica muttered under her breath, Roberto, who had been silently writing down Benjamin's words in his notebook, looked up from his notepad.\n\"It's alright, Miss Monica. I'm also a beginner when it comes to romance. That's why I believe there is room for growth.\"\n\"O-Ooh…\"\n\"I've learned that romance is like a high-level chess match. I'm skilled at the tactics of chess, so I believe I can learn the tactics of romance as well. Let's strive together as beginners in love.\"\nIt makes sense in a way, or maybe it doesn't… Monica held her head in her hands.\nBenjamin thinks in terms of music, Monica in terms of mathematics, and Roberto in terms of chess.\nThere is certainly a deep disconnect between these three, but Monica doesn't realize it.\nIn the end, what is love… Maybe it's just one of the processes of reproductive activity, like a feeling… Oh, but even without love, organisms can engage in reproductive activity… Wait, does that mean love isn't necessary for the survival of the species…?\nAs Monica pondered, a low voice echoed from above.\n\"…During class, talking is strictly prohibited.\"\nWhen she looked up, she saw Instructor Boyd, a teacher with a stern face like a seasoned mercenary, staring at them.\nThe four of them apologized in unison and quickly rearranged the chess pieces.",

      "content": "On that day, at a tea party, Lana Colette was taken aback by her friend's words.\n\"Oh, um… Lana, have you ever fallen in love with someone?\"\nMonica said, fidgeting with her small fingers. Her usually pale cheeks were slightly tinged with blush.\nCould it be that, perhaps, possibly, maybe?\n\"Monica… Do you have someone you like!?\"\nLana leaned forward in excitement, but Claudia, sitting next to her, looked at her coldly. Lana quickly realized that they were in the tea room of a large hall, not a private room, and hurriedly sat back in her chair.\nWhen it gets a bit warmer, they can use the outdoor tea room, but it's still the middle of winter. For a small tea party like this, most students use the tea room in this large hall.\nAlthough there is some distance between the tea tables, if they speak too loudly, it will reach the nearby tables.\nLana cleared her throat and looked at Monica, adjusting her posture.\nMonica, in her usual manner, speaks softly with a troubled expression.\n\"Well… Um… it's not about me… but there's someone very dedicated to someone they love…\"\nStarting with the preface that it's not about herself but about an acquaintance, Lana hinted at her own situation.\n…This must be about Monica, surely.\nIf that's the case, it would lead to a discussion about who Monica's love interest is.\nTo tell the truth, Lana had an idea of who that person might be. If she received the flower arrangement on the day of the school festival, then the other person is definitely that person.\nFor Lana, her true desire was for Monica to come to the trading company she planned to establish after graduation. But if Monica has someone she likes enough to want to get engaged, Lana wouldn't hesitate to support her.\nLana took out a fan she rarely used, covering her mouth, and spoke in a hushed tone to Claudia in the neighboring seat.\n\"Hey, so… that someone is, you know it right…?\"\n\"…………\"\n\"Is it your older brother? Haven't you heard anything about that?\"\nEven when Lana spoke to her, Claudia's beautiful face remained impassive.\nSay something, Lana glared at her, and Claudia looked straight at Monica with her unreadable eyes and said,\n\"…Monica, when is your birthday?\"\n\"Huh? Um, last month.\"\n\"I see. I was born in autumn. I'm a few months older than you.\"\n\"I-I see…\"\nSuddenly asked about her birthday, Monica seemed confused. Naturally.\nTo Monica's perplexed expression, Claudia said in her usual languid tone,\n\"…You can call me older sister-in-law.\"\nLana couldn't help but shout,\n\"I never said to take the conversation that far!\"\n\"…It's an important matter. If I were Monica's younger sister-in-law, it would confuse everyone around.\"\n\"Well, it's true that it would be a little confusing if Monica became your younger sister-in-law…\"\nLana involuntarily blushed and pursed her lips, and Claudia looked at her with a somewhat exasperated expression.\n\"For nobles, marriage is a familiar topic.\"\n\"W-Well, yes, that's true, but…\"\n\"I didn't say anything out of the ordinary… Un.der.stand?\"\n\"…Ugh.\"\nIn the first place, when it comes to nobles, it's common for parents to decide on a fiancé for their children in their early childhood. Only a few can have a love marriage… well, it seems Lana's father had a love marriage.\nWhile Lana and Claudia were having that conversation, Monica, who had been left out all along, interjected with a troubled expression.\n\"Um… Lady Claudia, does that mean you're getting a younger brother or sister?\"\n\"In the near future.\"\n\"C-Congratulations, then.\"\nMonica seemed to have missed the meaning behind Lana and Claudia's exchange, and the conversation took a subtle detour.\nClearing her throat, Lana tried to steer the conversation back to Monica, maintaining a natural demeanor.\n\"Monica, you mentioned there's someone among your acquaintances who is really dedicated to the person they love, right?\"\nIt's probably about Monica herself, Lana murmured in her heart, and Monica nodded curtly.\n\"Yes, that's right. She really wants to meet the person they like…\"\nUpon hearing Monica's words, Lana nodded thoughtfully.\nAh, different years, huh? So it means they won't be able to see each other after graduation.\n\"I see, when you're in love, you can do things you wouldn't normally do.\"\n\"Yes, that's what love is.\"\nLana didn't particularly have someone she liked right now, but she nodded as a senior response.\nMonica looked at Lana with eyes that saw her as a reliable older sister and spoke.\n\"I've never seriously faced love before, so I don't really understand those feelings… That's why I thought about it. If I could formulate the relationship between love and action into an equation, it might be useful in the future, don't you think?\"\n\"Hold on.\"\n\"I've even delved into philosophical books about love, but they often describe it as ‘Love is like…' drawing comparisons to fever or music. Honestly, I find it rather perplexing… I believe vague and abstract expressions like ‘like…' are inadequate. I desire something more concrete, like ‘Love equals …,' or better yet, I yearn for a clear demonstration through an equation… In a philosophical book I recently read, it stated that ‘Love is a type of desire,' but if that's the case, I think I would understand it better if they presented the specific substances produced in the human body due to love and how they influence desires…\"\n\"Wait, wait, wait.\"\nLana, happy for Monica's newfound optimism towards love, genuinely wanted to support her. However, she couldn't comprehend why Monica had veered so far off course in such an unexpected manner.\nClaudia had a look of utter boredom on her face as Lana held her head in her hands.\n\"…Medically presented? There's no medicine to cure the illness of love.\"\n\"I-I see…\"\nClaudia further added to Monica, who was at a loss for words.\n\"…In the first place, love itself is an abstract thing. If there were mathematicians capable of clearly defining something that takes different forms for different people, I would be intrigued to witness such an endeavor.\"\n\"…Different forms for different people…\"\nMonica echoed, appearing surprised by such an obvious realization.\nNervously fidgeting and twisting her fingers, she turned her gaze towards Claudia.\n\"Um, L-Lady Claudia, what form does your ‘love' take?\"\nIn response to a potentially provocative question, Claudia easily replied.\n\"I want to be special to Neil.\"\n\"Does that mean wanting to be someone's special is love?\"\nMonica pondered for a while, seemingly lost in thought.\nWith a particular idea in mind, Monica furrowed her brows and murmured sadly.\n\"…I dislike being treated as special. I prefer things to be ordinary…\"\nIt seemed that Claudia's notion of \"love's form\" did not resonate with Monica.\nLana interjected with a slightly sisterly expression.\n\"Well, I believe it is also valid to have a form of love where you feel at ease with someone you can be yourself around.\"\nNote that this is not Lana speaking from experience but an episode involving Lana's parents.\nAlthough she had been wearing a mature facade all along, the truth was that Lana also lacked experience in love.\nAfter all, her first love was her father, and in her childhood, she used to say, \"I'm going to marry Daddy!\" (Lana's father was slim and very fashionable and wonderful in his younger days.)\nCome to think of it, she vaguely recalled making a promise to marry her childhood friend, but that was merely innocent child's play.\n\"Love isn't solely about excitement. It's also acceptable to fall in love with someone who makes you feel calm when you're together.\"\n\"…Someone who makes you feel calm when you're together…\"\nMonica nodded and murmured one word.\n\"…The person who makes me the calmest… is Lana, maybe.\"\nLana said nothing and gently stroked Monica's head.",

      "content": "Nearly a month had passed since Monica had been approached by Bridget for cooperation when at last Nero awoke from his hibernation.\nIt was Lynn, the contracted spirit of Louis Miller, who happened to visit the attic room at that exact moment.\nLynn, who hadn't visited in a long while, seemed to have already heard from Louis about the tumultuous magic duel.\nMumbling sleepily and rubbing his eyes with his front paws, Nero listened as Lynn spoke fluently about the magical battles.\n\"…And so, the fierce battle between four men over the honor of the ‘Silent Witch' has now begun. In the presence of the public, the men fall to the cunning schemes of the evil demon lord Hubert Dee. Then, the ‘Silent Witch' arrives, unleashing the sealed forbidden powers to thoroughly pulverize Hubbard D…\"\n\"What's that all about? All this exciting stuff happened while I was asleep…!\"\n\"Um, um, uhh…\"\nMonica interjected hesitantly, and Lynn, with a doll-like expressionless face, asked, \"Yes?\" as if it were nothing at all.\n\"It's just, some of the facts seem to be… different…\"\n\"Yes, I may have taken some liberties with the story,\" Rin admitted without a hint of embarrassment, prompting Monica to cover her face with her hands.\nNero, now fully awake, sparkled his golden eyes with excitement.\n\"Darn, I regret hibernating through it all. If I were there, I'd have crashed the party.\"\n\"Yes, I also deeply regret not being present at the scene,\" Lynn agreed.\nSurely, the situation would have become uncontrollable if these two had been there.\nAfter all, Lynn is a high-ranking wind spirit, and Nero, though he hides his true form, is a black dragon. If these two had intervened in the magic duel… just the thought would have been terrifying.\nIt's a good thing Nero was hibernating… and that Lynn wasn't there at the time… Wait a second?\nMonica suddenly remembered.\nShe had heard through the grapevine that the magical duel's barrier was assisted by Louis Miller. That is to say, Louis was there.\nWhen traveling long distances, Louis usually relies on Lynn's flight magic. Although Louis himself can use flight magic, humans don't possess enough mana to endure long flights.\n…On the day of the magic duel, Louis was there, but Lynn wasn't? …Come to think of it, Lynn hasn't been around much lately…\nWith a slight concern, Monica asked Lynn.\n\"Um, Lynn, have you been… busy lately?\"\nLynn nodded briefly and replied matter-of-factly.\n\"Yes, I've been preoccupied assisting with Louis' schemes.\"\n\"…Is it okay… for you to say that?\"\n\"There hasn't been any order to keep silent.\"\nMost likely, there was no gag order, but it wasn't something to be casually spread around.\nThis beautiful maid seemed to lack the ability to read the room or to perceive others' feelings.\nNonetheless, Monica wondered what Louis was plotting. While she couldn't help but be curious, she feared that asking too much would also involve her, so she refrained from delving deeper.\nLynn received a status report from Monica, tucked it into her apron pocket, and placed her foot on the windowsill.\n\"Then, I shall take my leave,\" she said.\nWith that, the maid in her uniform gracefully leaped out the window, carried by the spring night breeze.\nAs the jet-black maid's uniform and the vivid golden hair blended into the night and disappeared from sight, Monica quietly closed the window.\n\"…Nero.\"\nAt her unusually solemn voice, Nero twitched his whiskers.\n\"I'll tell you what happened while you were hibernating.\"\n\"That's something you don't want the Sis Maid or her backer, Loulouinpappa, to hear, right?\"\nMonica nodded and began to summarize the events that occurred while Nero was asleep.\nThe shady incident of the cursed dragon, the involvement of the Duke of Crockford.\nThe fact that the Abyss Shaman and the Thorn Witch, both fellow sages, have agreed to assist in investigating the Duke of Crockford.\nAnd that she, along with Bridget, would infiltrate the Duke of Crockford's residence.\nAfter hearing the summary, Nero stroked his chin with his front paw, like a human, and hummed thoughtfully.\n\"Bridget… Ah, I remember. She's the prickly woman who ignored my sexy pose.\"\n\"…Sexy pose? Wait, what are you talking about?\"\nIgnoring Monica's question, Nero continued to muse to himself.\n\"So the prickly woman suspects the glittering prince is an imposter… And Monica, what do you think?\"\n\"To be honest, I'm half-convinced… There's definitely something off about Prince Felix… But… I can't quite believe they could conveniently find someone who looks exactly like him…\"\nAfter all, Felix's face is one of golden proportions, a rare beauty Monica herself admires. Such a person isn't easily found.\nAs Monica pondered, Nero widened his eyes in wonder.\n\"Can't something like that be easily done with magic? You know, like the creepy squishy clay guy at the school festival.\"\nNero is probably referring to Yuan's body manipulation magic. That man had distorted his face like clay to disguise himself as someone else. Indeed, with that magic, it would be possible to impersonate the real Felix.\nBut that's not possible.\n\"…Body manipulation magic is considered forbidden in the Ridill Kingdom. It seems to have been decriminalized in the Empire a few years ago… but according to Bridget, Prince Felix's personality changed ten years ago, so the timeline doesn't quite fit, I think.\"\nTo Monica's knowledge, research on body manipulation magic was, until just a few years ago, limited to enhancing body parts, stopping bleeding, or erasing scars.\n\"Besides, the Duke of Crockford advocates for war with the Empire, so it doesn't seem likely that he would bring in Imperial technology…\"\nNero hummed in response to Monica's words.\nThen, as if hit by a sudden thought, he tapped Monica's knee with his paw.\n\"I've got it. Surely this glittering prince must be the real prince's twin brother. I've read about such a trick in a novel.\"\n\"…Surely if there were royal twins, it would be recorded somewhere.\"\n\"Tch, true.\"\nNero gave up easily and swung his tail in disappointment.\nMonica exhaled slowly and pulled a letter from her pocket.\nIt's from the ‘Thorn Witch' Raul Rosenburg, detailing the meeting place for the undercover operation happening in three days.\n…And it acknowledges Monica's request to bring along \"one more companion.\"\nClimbing onto Monica's shoulder to peek at the letter, Nero grinned smugly.\n\"So, this ‘one more companion' is me, right? First a servant, now a gardener. I'm up for it.\"\n\"No, Nero, you'll be staying behind this time.\"\n\"N-Nyani!?\"\nThe \"one more companion\" Monica had written about in her letter was none other than Bridget.\n\"I'll be mostly absent during the three-day holiday… I'd like to ask Nero to guard Prince Felix during that time.\"\n\"Tch, if that's the case, I can't help it… but hey, make sure to prepare plenty of books to kill time. Or better yet, borrow every Dustin Günter's works you can get from the library.\"\n\"Yes, yes.\"\nWhile nodding along, Monica felt a small sense of urgency clinging to her thoughts.\n…What is it? I feel like I'm missing something.\nMonica retraced her memories of recent events one by one.\nThe magic duel incident, the New Year's ceremony, the homecoming, the cursed dragon incident, the school festival, the night out in the pleasure district…\n\"Ah…\"\nWhat she barely touched upon in her memory was just before encountering Eig in the pleasure district, during her visit at the ‘Star Oracle Witch' Mary Harvey's residence.\n\"I’ve foreseen many futures of the kingdom, especially on the royal family… but for the past ten years, I’ve been unable to read Prince Felix’s destiny.\"\nThe number ten years coincided with Bridget's claim about when Felix fell ill and became unreachable.\nBridget speculated that the real Felix might be confined in the Duke of Crockford's residence.\nBut a worse suspicion crosses Monica's mind.\nCould it be that the real His Highness is…\nA compilation of Nero's nicknames for the characters\nLoulouinpappa (other) → Louis\nSis Maid → Lynn\nOrange Curls → Isabelle\nGlittering Prince → Felix\nChilly Guy→ Cyril\nLoud Boy→ Glenn\nFluffy Lady → Eliane\nPrickly Woman → Bridget\nAmong these nicknames, Nero seems to have a sense of malice only towards Louis.",

      "content": "On the morning of the infiltration into the Duke of Crockford's mansion.\nMonica was moving to a room in an inn near the mansion with Bridget, riding in a carriage, preparing for the infiltration… but then.\n\"Have you ever seen a gardener before?\"\nMonica, dressed in work pants and a shirt for gardening, was met with a cutting remark from Bridget.\nMonica looked over her attire again. Pants with suspenders and a well-worn shirt. She thought that with a hat on, she would look like a gardener from any angle, but Bridget had a frown creased between her brows.\n\"In what world is there such a pale gardener?\"\n\"…Ah.\"\nIndeed, she realized, it was unnatural for someone who works in the garden to be completely un-tanned. Even the beautiful Thorn Witch had a healthy tan from the sun.\nAs Monica became flustered upon realizing this, Bridget took out a bottle of grease paint from her luggage and placed it heavily on the table.\n\"First, rub this onto your skin. Not just your face, but your neck and hands too, everywhere that's exposed.\"\n\"Y-Yes.\"\nMonica scooped up the dark grease paint with her finger and tried rubbing it on the back of her hand. As she thoroughly spread it, her pale skin turned a sunburnt reddish-brown.\nWhile Monica was applying the grease paint, Bridget had changed from her beautiful dress into a worn shirt and pants. The boots she swapped into were also well-used and stained with mud. Her thoroughness was evident.\nMoreover, Bridget tied back her beautiful blonde hair and tucked it into a cap.\nHowever, no matter how much she hid her beautiful hair or applied grease paint to her skin, her striking beauty couldn't be fully concealed.\nMonica thought it would be impossible for Bridget to infiltrate… but then Bridget took some cotton out of her luggage and put it in her mouth. Finally, putting on a pair of unfashionable glasses changed her impression drastically.\n\"Howfur aboot this?\"\nBridget's voice was muffled, now with a unique downtown accent.\n\"Uh… Lady… Bridget?\"\nMonica couldn't help but let out a dumbfounded voice, to which Bridget snorted through her nose with a laugh.\n\"Aren't you a spy for the Count of Kerbeck? What are you so surprised about for something of this level?\"\n\"I'm sorry…\"\nMonica knew that Bridget was fluent in languages, but she hadn't expected her to master the downtown accent as well.\nAs Monica was impressed, Bridget took out two pairs of thick gardening gloves and handed one to Monica.\n\"Also, make sure you never take off these gloves. No matter how much you change the color of your skin, the condition of your hands will give away your social status at a glance.\"\nMonica was now ashamed of herself for doubting whether Bridget could handle the infiltration. Bridget was far more thorough than Monica.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAs Monica and Bridget arrived at the Duke of Crockford's mansion, they were greeted by the Thorn Witch, Raul Rosenburg.\n\"Hey there, what a perfect day for some good ol' gardening!\"\nWith his rosy curls and deep green eyes, Raul's beauty could rival that of a fairy tale prince. His smile revealed dazzling white teeth, and despite standing next to Felix and Bridget, Raul's appearance was equally captivating. Today too, he was dressed in his familiar work clothes, complete with a shovel over his shoulder.\nBridget whispered to Monica, \"What's with that ridiculously good-looking gardener who seems so out of place?\"\nEven the well-informed Bridget didn't seem to realize that he was one of the Seven Sages, the Thorn Witch. Though, Monica was also one of the Seven Sages.\n\"W-well, y-you see… h-he's our h-helper for this operation,\" Monica stuttered.\nShe had informed Raul beforehand that Bridget would be accompanying them and asked him to keep her identity as the Silent Witch a secret. Raul didn't pry too much into Bridget's background and readily agreed, saying, \"She's a friend of Monica's, right? Of course, she's welcome to join us!\"\nIn addition to Raul, there were about eight servants of the Rosenburg family at the site. They were all skilled in gardening, their faces tanned from working under the sun. Monica realized once again that Bridget's judgment had been correct. If Monica were the only one with pale skin among them, it would indeed look unnatural.\n\"Let me give you a quick rundown of today's schedule. We'll be working until noon. The flower bed team will mainly be sowing seeds and planting seedlings. The tree team will be pruning. I'll be overseeing everything. Monica and Bridget, you're officially on the flower bed team, but feel free to take breaks and move around as you like. However, it might be better to wait until after lunch to investigate the mansion.\"\n\"…Um, is something happening at lunch?\"\n\"I've been asked by the butler about the flowers to decorate the mansion. I told him I wanted to see the rooms where they'll be displayed, and he said I could take a look after the morning work was done. So if you accompany me then, you'll naturally get to see the inside of the mansion.\"\n\"In that case, I'd like to accompany you then. T-thank you very much.\"\n\"No problem, leave it to me!\"\nRaul thumped his chest confidently and went to fetch the seedlings on a cart while humming a tune.\nWatching him go, Bridget muttered with a puzzled expression, \"He's not only in charge of the Duke of Crockford's garden but also the flowers inside the mansion? Just who is that guy…?\"\n\"Ha, ha, ha…\"\nTo reiterate, he was neither a gardener nor a florist. He was one of the top magicians in the country.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nEven Monica knew that the Duke of Crockford was the most powerful noble in the country.\nTherefore, she had thought that his mansion would be splendidly decorated and glittering with gold, but the duke's mansion was much more elegant than Monica had imagined and, above all, had an air that spoke of history. The dignified appearance of the building, with its historical details in every decoration, overwhelmed the beholder in a way that was different from its splendor and magnificence. The grounds were incredibly spacious, and it was understandable why so many people were needed to maintain the garden.\nAfter moving to the garden, Raul greeted the servants of the duke's mansion with a casual, \"Hello, hello,\" while giving instructions to his subordinates.\nSeeing how busy he was, Monica couldn't help but wonder if she should also help, but Bridget whispered to her in exasperation.\n\"Have you already forgotten why we came all this way?\"\n\"Ugh…\"\nAs Monica faltered, Bridget snorted in exasperation and called out to Raul.\n\"Head gardener, we're going to pull some weeds.\"\n\"Sure, just do whatever you want!\"\nBridget nodded once in response to Raul's words and started walking, pulling Monica along.\n\"Come on, let's go. First, we'll investigate the outside of the mansion.\"\n\"Y-Yes, ma'am.\"\nShe truly is a reliable young lady. If Bridget hadn't been there, Monica might have gotten carried away by the atmosphere and ended up focusing on helping with the gardening.\nBridget seemed to think that the real Felix was hidden somewhere on the grounds of the duke's mansion. She already seemed to have an idea of where he might be.\n\"The most suspicious places are the rooms on the second floor and above the duke's mansion. The first floor is where guests come and go, so it's less likely. First, we'll go around the outside of the mansion and check the windows. If there's a room with curtains drawn unnaturally, consider it suspicious.\"\n\"I, I see…\"\nAs for Monica, she wanted to investigate the connection between Peter, the mastermind behind the cursed dragon incident, and the Duke of Crockford, but she decided to prioritize Bridget's objective for now.\nBridget looked up at the windows and muttered in a voice too low to be heard by those around her.\n\"Also, there's a servant in this mansion that I want to get in touch with.\"\n\"…Someone you want to get in touch with?\"\n\"He was a personal servant to Prince Felix when he was a child. He's probably about my age or a little older. Blond hair. There's a scar near his right eye, and he used to hide it with his bangs, so you'll know him when you see him.\"\nBridget stopped talking there, closed her eyes once, and then slowly opened them.\n\"That man was the only one in this mansion who was on Prince Felix's side. I don't know if he's still in this mansion, but if he is… he must know something.\"\nWith those words, Bridget started walking again. There was no hesitation in her steps. She must have visited this mansion several times before.\n\"L-Lady Bridget… y-you're amazing…\"\nWhether it was her disguise or the way she planned her investigation, she was much more efficient and thorough than Monica.\nBridget, who was walking ahead, turned back to Monica slightly and snorted.\n\"…How many years do you think it took me to prepare for this?\"\nThere was weight in her whisper.\nSurely, Bridget had been searching for her prince ever since the day Felix's personality changed, all by herself.\n…Without being able to confide in anyone.\n\"This is my first and last chance. If I miss this, there probably won't be another opportunity… It's only natural to prepare meticulously.\"\nSuddenly, Bridget stopped walking. Her gaze was fixed on a small cottage to her right and slightly ahead.\n\"…That's a cottage I don't remember.\"\nIt was a small cottage built in a slightly open area behind the mansion. It wasn't exactly new, but compared to the historic duke's mansion, it looked relatively new.\n\"Even you don't know about this cottage, Lady Bridget?\"\n\"When I used to come and go from this duke's mansion as a child, there was a much more rundown storage shed there. …It was probably rebuilt after that.\"\nUnder her glasses for the disguise, her amber eyes shone brightly.\n\"…It's suspicious. We're going to investigate it.\"",

      "content": "The cottage Bridget found did indeed have a window to let in light, but it was positioned so high that peering inside to discern the interior proved challenging.\n\"It doesn't look locked… We're going in.\"\nMonica's eyes widened in shock at Bridget's hasty decision-making.\n\"W-What?! What if someone's inside, what will we do… then…?\"\n\"If it's the real prince, we'll be overjoyed. If not, we'll just say we mistook it for a storage shed,\" Bridget replied, and without waiting for Monica to stop her, she opened the door.\nThe shed wasn't a mere storage space but appeared to be a living area where someone resided.\nThere was a kitchen counter and rustic furniture—all of which had an aura of being well-used.\nHowever, it was hard to believe that the real Prince Felix—a person of nobility—would live here. It seemed only slightly more refined than the mountain cabin Monica had lived in.\nAt the back of the room was a bed, and it seemed someone was sleeping there. Bridget's profile lit up with anticipation at the sight of the bed's bulge.\nShe surely wanted to call out \"Your Highness!\" Yet, Bridget closed her lips, which had begun to part, and quietly approached the bed.\n\"…Hmm? Is it time for food?\"\nThe person lying in the bed rolled over and looked up at them.\nAs expected, it wasn't the real Prince Felix but a frail, white-haired old man.\n\"Well now, who might you young ladies be… new servants?\"\nThe old man, still lying in bed, looked up at Bridget and Monica with round, cloudy eyes, seemingly surprised.\nBridget spoke up for the tongue-tied Monica.\n\"Ah, sorry about this. We're here to tend to the garden today. We were looking for a scythe to borrow; thought this might be a storage shed.\"\n\"Ah, I see, that's what it was. I'm sorry for the trouble; my back's been hurting. The scythe is in that wooden box over there. All the gardening tools are in there, so take whatever you need.\"\nWith a \"Thank you,\" Bridget began rummaging through the wooden box as directed.\nEach tool inside looked to be for gardening. And there, along the wall, hung work clothes and boots stained with mud and grass.\nMonica couldn't help but glance at the old man. Though thin, his skin was tanned reddish-brown.\n\"…Are you, sir, the gardener of this mansion?\"\n\"Yes, I've served this estate for a good forty years now.\"\nThe gardener explained that he still tended to the garden every day, but due to age and weak limbs, he relied on outside help for major tasks like today's planting.\nSo this cottage was a combination of a gardener's workshop and his home.\nThe old man struggled to rise from bed and looked at Monica.\n\"Ah, miss, would you mind grabbing that medicine for me? Yes, that paper bag there.\"\nThe old man must have had a hard time getting up. Following his request, Monica picked up the paper bag.\nThe bag listed the medicine's name, instructions to take one packet after meals, and the name of the person who prescribed it.\nThat name made Monica's eyes widen in shock.\n—Peter Sams\nIt was the name of the man who infiltrated the Duke Reinberg's residence, caused the cursed dragon incident, and betrayed Monica's father.\nMonica's heart pounded so hard it felt audible.\nAs Monica stared at the paper bag, the old man looked at her curiously and asked, \"What's wrong?\"\nWith a forced smile, Monica handed the bag to the old man and asked,\n\"Um, well, I'm personally indebted to Mr. Peter Sams… Is he still here at the mansion?\"\nMonica did her best to think on her feet as she asked, and the old man sighed a bit sadly in response.\n\"Come to think of it, I haven't seen him around lately. His medicine is running low, which is troubling.\"\n\"…Mr. Peter Sams made this medicine?\"\n\"He was a doctor… huh? No, was that wrong? A researcher for the master, perhaps? …Well, it's the same thing as a doctor.\"\nPeter was a pure-blooded shaman who had apprenticed to the Albright family, the Abyss Shaman.\nIn some regions, it wasn't unusual for shamans to perform medical or pharmaceutical tasks.\nWhile at the Duke of Crockford's residence, Peter probably conducted his curse studies in secret while publicly presenting himself as a doctor.\nIt's as Lord Abyss Shaman said… Mr. Peter Sams was indeed connected to the Duke of Crockford…\nMonica wanted more information about Peter.\nThough Bridget looked at Monica with a suspicious face, she didn't rush her or interject.\nMonica placed a hand over her thundering heart, trying to steady her breathing.\nMonica wasn't skilled at improvising lies or probing for information, but she wanted to extract whatever she could, however clumsily.\n\"Peter worked at this mansion for a long time… How many years… was it?\"\n\"About ten, I reckon. Came around the same time the previous doctor, Arthur, left.\"\nArthur. The name tugged at Monica's memory.\nArthur? Who was that again? …Right, that time…\nMonica recalled the words Peter Sams had uttered just before his death.\n\"Ah, ah, I know His Excellency wouldn't let me escape… hah, haha, hahaha, I won't end up like Arthur!\"\nArthur must have been the doctor serving before Peter, likely exterminated by the hands of the Duke of Crockford since Peter muttered ‘I won't end up like Arthur' on his deathbed.\nAs Monica mulled over this, Bridget, as if to fill the silence, casually struck up a conversation with the old man.\n\"You've been working at this mansion for a long time, haven't you? So, did you happen to see Prince Felix when he was a child?\"\n\"Yes, Prince Felix did stay here during his boyhood… but he was a frail one. He hardly went outside, so I only saw him a few times… Besides—\"\nThe old man paused, his gaze drifting into the distance, then murmured softly,\n\"—After that incident and his illness, Prince Felix completely shut himself away.\"\nBridget's eyes sparkled behind her glasses, and Monica noticed.\nDisguising her curiosity as idle chatter, Bridget leaned in eagerly.\n\"What incident?\"\nThe old man didn't answer immediately but took some powder from the paper bag, swallowed it down with water from a jug, and placed the bag by his pillow before looking around the shed.\n\"This cottage, you see, used to be even more rundown. Back then, I lived with the other servants and this place was just for storage… Then there was a fire. Two servants died trying to put it out.\"\nA chill ran down Monica's spine at the ominous feeling.\nThe fire occurred around the same time Prince Felix fell ill.\nThe two people who died in that fire.\n\"…W-Who were the ones that passed away?\"\nMonica interjected, and the old man murmured,\n\"The doctor I mentioned earlier, Arthur, and a young servant boy of the prince. The head maid at the time, old Marcy, was so shocked by the incident she went off to a convent… The prince was fond of both the head maid and the servant boy, so he took it hard and shut himself away.\"\n\"And, the name of the servant boy who died, what was it?\"\nThe old man's eyes crinkled with remembrance, a nostalgic look on his face.\n\"Isaac Walker… He was a kind and gentle boy who was always willing to help me. He was a loyal subject of Prince Felix.\"",

      "content": "Bridget, upon leaving the cottage, muttered with a bitter expression on her face.\n\"…To think that the servant had long been dead.\"\nFor Bridget, the young servant Isaac Walker, who knew Felix well, was a valuable source of information. The fact that he was already deceased made her anxious.\n\"I thought by winning over that servant, I could get closer to the truth…\"\nWith regret in her voice, Bridget groaned, and Monica, looking down, asked her.\n\"…Um, what sort of person was this Mr. Isaac?\"\n\"He was infuriatingly competent. His Highness was fond of him, almost like a brother… as much as it pains me to admit, he was far more beloved than I ever was.\"\nShe clenched her back teeth so tightly it was clear how much it irked her.\n\"Honestly, in searching for the real His Highness, that servant Isaac was our best lead. He was a loyalist and would have done anything for His Highness. If His Highness had been switched with an impostor… he would not have kept silent.\"\nBridget removed her non-prescription glasses and rubbed the furrow between her brows with her finger.\n\"…Or perhaps, Isaac Walker was killed to silence him because he was too close to His Highness. I don't know about the physician named Arthur who died with him.\"\nMonica did not affirm or deny Bridget's murmurs, simply casting her gaze downward.\nNow, a hypothesis was forming in Monica's mind.\n…But she still lacked the necessary pieces to connect it all.\nThe two then circled the mansion in silence, searching for any suspicious rooms from the outside. However, as Bridget had described, there were no rooms sealed off by curtains.\nWhen they returned to the garden at the front of the mansion, Raul, with mud on his cheeks, waved and called out to them, \"Hey! Hey!\"\n\"I'm about to tour the inside of the mansion with the butler, come join us!\"\nNaturally, Monica and Bridget had no reason to refuse. When they nodded, Raul handed them each a basket filled with cut flowers, saying, \"Then, take this.\"\nHe also took a basket of flowers and guided them to the main entrance.\nAn elderly butler was waiting at the entrance. Raul, with his easygoing manner, spoke to the butler, who was much older than him.\n\"Since we're going to choose the flowers for the mansion, I think it would be good to get some opinions from young ladies.\"\n\"…I see, if that's the case, it's fine with me.\"\nBridget looked curiously at the butler. It puzzled her why a butler, who held a high position among the servants, would show such deference to an external gardener.\nAs mentioned before, Raul is one of the Seven Sages, holding the status of a magic count.\n\"Then, this way, please.\"\nThe butler opened the door and invited the three inside.\nThe interior of the mansion, like the exterior, was tastefully and beautifully decorated.\nThe scarlet carpet was woven with subtly different shades of thread upon closer examination, and the column reliefs changed impression depending on whether viewed from afar or up close. Every single item that made up the mansion harmonized to create this space.\nAnd it was Raul's role to choose flowers that matched this meticulously calculated, beautiful space.\nMonica, who knew Raul spent more time cultivating vegetables than flowers, couldn't help but worry if he was up to selecting flowers for the mansion. However, Raul confidently directed the butler without hesitation.\n\"The main entrance would look good with the recently bred double-flowered roses. They have a strong fragrance, but it will spread nicely in a large space. They're also quite bright and visually appealing. Plus, being a rare variety, it should be well received by guests.\"\n\"I see… Then, what about this room?\"\n\"It's the room where we had purple Digitalis in early summer. Let’s change the atmosphere by choosing flowers with a softer impression. Mainly apricot-colored flowers, complemented with white Orlaya, should significantly transform the mood.\"\nContrary to Monica's concerns, Raul was adept at suggesting various flowers.\nMonica could hardly understand half of the terms Raul used, but Bridget murmured softly, \"He's quite capable, that man,\" indicating Raul's instructions were likely appropriate.\nAfter touring the first floor, the butler led them to the second floor.\nBridget probably thought that the real Felix might be confined on a floor above the second. Her eyes sharpened noticeably.\nTypically, the first floor contained rooms for entertaining guests, with more private spaces on the upper floors. This mansion was no exception, and the second floor held many rooms used by the residents.\nBridget seemed to have a general idea of the room layout as well. When the butler stopped in front of a particular door, her profile tensed slightly.\n\"This is the room that His Highness Felix used during his childhood,\" the butler announced as he opened the door.\nExpecting a child's room, Monica was surprised to find that all the furniture inside was sized for adults.\nRaul surveyed the room and then asked the butler, \"This room, is it still in use by His Highness?\"\n\"Yes, when he occasionally stays here, it is made available for his use.\"\nThe furniture is also relatively new, suggesting that most of the items from Felix's childhood have been replaced. This is likely because the room is still used by Felix on occasion.\nYet Bridget's gaze lingered on the room's furnishings with a kind of wistful affection, as if picturing the young Felix who once inhabited this space.\n\"Hmm, such an elegant room. Tell me, butler, what flowers adorned this room the last time His Highness stayed?\"\n\"It was the Eris, sir.\"\n\"…Eris?\"\nRaul echoed the word, a term unfamiliar even to a flower expert like himself—perhaps it was an unusual variety?\nWhile Monica pondered this, Bridget murmured softly, \"…Iris.\"\nAt her utterance, the butler's face showed a sudden realization, and he quickly corrected himself.\n\"My apologies, it was the iris. A man who used to work here would call the iris ‘Eris'… it's stuck with me.\"\n\"Oh, you mean the iris! ‘Eris' is, uh, what was it, the imperial way of saying it?\"\nRaul clapped his hands as if it made sense, and the butler nodded ambiguously, his face uneasy.\nAt that moment, something clicked inside Monica.\n\"Um, excuse me!!\"\nMonica's raised voice drew startled looks from the butler, Raul, and Bridget.\nNormally she might have cowered, but Monica was desperate now.\n\"That person who used to work here, could it possibly be he was A—\"\n\"Excuse the interruption.\"\nJust then, the door opened as if to cut off Monica's words.\nTurning toward the door, Monica involuntarily caught her breath. It wasn't just Monica; Bridget too was taken aback.\nStanding there was the master of the mansion, the Duke of Crockford, Darius Nightray.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nA commanding presence that draws people's attention simply by being there.\nWith just a word, a simple gesture, he had the power to make people obey, to move the masses—a kind of charisma that only a very few possess. The Duke of Crockford, Darius Nightley, exuded this from his very being. Tracing his roots, this man too carried the blood of royalty.\nIt made sense that Felix sometimes showed a sense of intimidation and the skill to make people follow him; he likely learned it from the Duke of Crockford.\nThe unexpected appearance of the Duke had left both Monica and Bridget frozen. They had not anticipated that the busy Duke would be present in the mansion.\nHowever, Raul greeted the Duke with the same cheerfulness he showed everyone else.\n\"Ah, Your Excellency. Good day. Did you come to see us?\"\n\"I thought of giving my greetings to you.\"\nAt those words, Bridget's eyes widened in shock as she stared at Raul. It was natural. The most powerful man in the country coming to greet a mere gardener was unthinkable.\nRaul's tone was a touch more respectful than usual, but still casual, which was another surprise for Bridget.\n\"Did you like this year's flowers? You told me you wanted ‘new varieties developed in this country,' so I planted quite a few of those.\"\n\"Hm, flowers that symbolize the technology and wealth of this country are ideal.\"\nBreeding new varieties of flowers requires a considerable amount of money and time. A new species of flower is a treasure in itself.\nThat's why the Duke of Crockford, wanting to flaunt his power, would fill his gardens with domestically bred flowers.\nThe Duke spared no expense or effort in displaying his power.\nMonica had learned at the Serendia Academy that flaunting one's power to satisfy one's ego was the behavior of a third-rate noble.\nFor the first-rate nobility, the act of displaying power was merely a means to maintain their family's status and dignity.\n\"…And who might these two be?\"\nThe Duke then turned his gaze towards Monica and Bridget.\nMonica swallowed hard. She had just had a one-on-one conversation with the Duke following the New Year's ceremony. Although Monica had concealed her face at that time, she had spoken one phrase at the end.\n\"I want nothing from you…\"\nWhat if my voice gives me away…!\nStealing a glance at Bridget, she too looked tense. Bridget likely had more encounters with the Duke than Monica ever had.\nAs Monica and Bridget fell silent, Raul came to their rescue.\n\"These two are from my household.\"\n\"…I thought I had instructed you to refrain from unnecessarily letting servants into the mansion.\"\nThe Duke stared sharply at Monica and Bridget.\nHis gaze seemed to carry an intimidation that could crush a heart with a cold grip.\nBut Raul, unfazed, replied casually.\n\"They're also my apprentices, and I wanted to teach them how to decorate with flowers in a mansion. There's hardly a better place for it than this estate.\"\n\"…Hmph, that's quite an advanced lesson for apprentices.\"\n\"Well, it's a family motto to use the best education materials!\"\nRaul's lighthearted retort, whether true or false, elicited a chuckle from the Duke, slightly softening his intimidating aura.\n\"…I see, there is a certain persuasiveness when it comes from the country's greatest magician… Lord ‘Thorn Witch.'\"\nSeeing Bridget's dumbfounded expression, Monica's mind raced with how they would explain themselves afterward.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nOnce they had finished all their tasks and left the mansion, Raul had the Roseburg family carriage take Monica and the others to their inn.\nNormally, servants would ride in a cart with their tools, but Monica and Bridget were treated as exceptions.\nInside the carriage, Raul, still smiling, asked Monica:\n\"Did you find any useful information?\"\n\"…Yes.\"\nMonica's clear response made Raul nod with satisfaction as he playfully slapped her shoulder.\n\"Next time you need help, just let me know, okay? We're friends, right!\"\n\"Th-thank you very much,\" Monida said in response to Raul's boisterous voice as she glanced at Bridget tremblingly.\nMonica had thought Bridget would react in some way to the fact that Monica was friends with the Thorn Witch, but Bridget remained silent, staring down at her feet.\nEven after they got out of the carriage and returned to their room, Bridget remained silent.\nShe spat out the cotton she had been biting on and wiped her grease-paint-covered face with a cloth.\n\"…Um, Lady Bridget…\"\nThey had looked around the mansion, but there was no sign of a room where the real Felix seemed to be confined. Since they had almost entirely toured the place with Raul, there was no mistake.\nAt least, the prince that Bridget was seeking was not to be found in the Duke's residence.\nAnd Monica had a certain conviction about that.\n\"…Perhaps… the real Prince Felix is… already…\"\n\"Don't say it.\"\nBridget cut Monica off and buried her face in the cloth she had used to wipe her face.\n\"…I had a feeling, you know.\"\nIntelligent as she was, Bridget must have made the worst assumption when she felt that the current Felix was an imposter.\nNamely—that the real Felix Arc Ridill was already dead, and that was why a double had to take his place.\n\"…Still, I wanted to confirm the truth with my own hands and feet.\"\nBridget had covered her face for a while, but finally, she roughly wiped her face, let down her pinned-up blonde hair, and said in her usual manner:\n\"Thank you for your help, Monica Norton. I have many questions about your mysterious connections, but let's leave that aside for now.\"\n\"I… am grateful for that…\"\n\"I am aware that it will be difficult for me to delve further into this matter. Nevertheless, I must now consider our next step… even if His Highness is no longer with us. I want to know the truth.\"\nShe was strong, Monica thought.\nEven when faced with a cruel reality, Bridget was unyielding in her quest for the truth.\n…Still, I… cannot tell Lady Bridget everything.\nMonica clenched her fist just once and asked Bridget in a firm voice:\n\"Lady Bridget, you are also knowledgeable about foreign languages… aren't you?\"\n\"What of it?\"\n\"…Do you know what the name ‘Arthur' is in the imperial language?\"\nBridget furrowed her brows slightly, puzzled, and replied shortly:\n\"Arthür.\"\nMonica had heard that name during the school festival.\n——\"Yuan, have you confirmed that matters?\"\n——\"Yes, I pretended to catch a spider and checked from close range; there's no mistake. That was the work of the traitor Arthür… His judgment was correct.\"\n…It's connected.\nMonica clenched her trembling hand and said to Bridget in a firm voice:\n\"Lady Bridget. There's a place I would like to stop by before we go back to the academy.\"\n\"As compensation for your assistance, I'll take you anywhere. So, where do you want to go?\"\nAfter a moment of consideration, Monica opened her mouth to speak.\n\"…To the royal capital.\"\nPrev | TOC | NextTwitter Facebook LikeLoading...",

      "content": "——\"To Clayman, who loves spiders, let's verify the information about the ‘horrifying truth' you mentioned. I'm waiting for your contact. From the Silent Woman.\"\nThis was a message posted in the advertisement section of the largest newspaper in the royal capital of the Ridill Kingdom.\nYuan, whose main duty was intelligence work, naturally read various newspapers from both inside and outside the country daily, so he noticed this advertisement immediately.\n\"This is a message from the Silent Witch, I believe there's no mistake,\" Yuan said, handing the newspaper to his master.\nYuan is a man who whimsically changes his face, but in front of his master, he always maintains a slightly narrow-eyed, flat face.\nThis was a face that Yuan had once been forced to abandon, and at the same time, it was the face that put the least strain on him when using body manipulation magic.\n\"Let's see.\"\nThe man who is Yuan's master followed the text of the newspaper with his shining black eyes.\nThe man was a young man with loosely waving black hair. His deeply carved features were as majestic and beautiful as a mythological figure, but they are filled with a vitality and spirit that sculptures do not have.\nAs his sharp eyes slowly traced the text of the newspaper, his lips rose in a grin. That alone gave a ferocious impression as if a beast had bared its fangs.\n\"Silent Witch… indeed, she was one of the Seven Sages of the other country. Nice, Seven Sages. It has a good ring to it. The Four Heavenly Kings, the Three Musketeers… when they appear in a story, isn't it a thrilling sound?\"\nThe man made a face as if his thoughts were racing through the world of stories, and clapped his hands.\n\"Alright, let's make one too. Yes, if they have Seven Sages, let's increase our number here. Ten Warriors, Twelve Sword Saints, Thirteen Knights are also hard to give up… hmm, which one is good?\"\nWhen his master mentioned something completely unrelated to the main topic, Yuan gave a wry smile and said, \"You sure like to have whimsical thoughts,\" and his master laughed with a throaty sound that seemed truly enjoyable.\n\"Fool. How many times have you seen me turn ‘whimsical thoughts' into ‘actual results'?\"\n\"If I may say so, wouldn't it be better not to increase the number recklessly? If the number is too large, it will look inferior.\"\n\"Hmm, there's some truth to that. Alright, let's keep it to six or less. So, what do you think of this ‘Silent Witch' from your perspective?\"\nEven though he was saying something that seemed like a joke or serious play, this man always suddenly returned to the main topic.\nYuan, who was used to having conversations with such a master, answered in a smooth tone.\n\"The chantless magic used by the ‘Silent Witch' is something that those of us who make a living from assassination would find incredibly enviable.\"\nThe Silent Witch, if she wanted to, could behead an enemy without uttering a single word. There is no technique more suited to assassination than that.\n\"More than anything, its accuracy is extraordinary… it is more powerful in human combat than in dragon combat.\"\n\"If it comes to war, can it serve as a weapon?\"\n\"She is a monster. I can't believe we're the same living creature.\"\nAt Yuan's words, his master laughed out loud.\n\"People in the world would say that you, who have no face, are the monster, wouldn't they? Right, Yuan?\"\n\"Then, please think of the ‘Silent Witch' as a monster even greater than me.\"\n\"…Ooh?\"\nYuan's master grinned cruelly and tapped the armrest of his chair with his fingertips.\n\"Very interesting. By the way, Yuan, is this ‘Silent Witch' a good woman?\"\nYuan fell silent at his master's bad habit again.\nTo such Yuan, his master said while crossing his legs.\n\"I like a beautiful woman with big bosoms and buttocks, and her eyes are glittering with ambition and desire. The ideal is a poisonous woman like the first Thorn Witch.\"\n\"…Unfortunately, she is the exact opposite in all respects.\"\n\"What a bore! …But this chantless magic also piqued my interest.\"\nAt those words, Yuan felt something ominous and his cheeks twitched.\n\"My lord? I hope you're not thinking…\"\nWith a suspicious look in his eyes, Yuan's master grinned and showed his double teeth.\n\"I'm going too. To the Ridill Kingdom.\"\nYuan laughed desperately, \"Ohohoho,\" and with an extremely strained straight face, he said to his master.\n\"…This is just another whimsical thought of yours, right?\"\nHis master laughed heartily, \"Hahaha,\" as if to compete with Yuan.\n\"I love to put all my effort into turning my whimsical thoughts into reality!\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nTen days after Monica and Bridget infiltrated the Duke of Crockford's mansion, the long-planned student general meeting was held.\n\"Then, with this, the student general meeting is adjourned.\"\nListening to Felix's closing remarks, Monica sighed with relief.\nMonica, who is the treasurer, had been invited to several club presidents' tea parties during these ten days and had no time to rest, but with Bridget's support, she was able to get through it safely.\nWith this, all the events that the student council is involved in, except for the graduation ceremony, have ended.\n\"…I'm glad it's over safely.\"\nAs Monica muttered to herself in the back, Cyril nodded in agreement with his arms crossed.\nCyril, with his blue eyes, was looking at Felix, who was standing on the stage, with a deeply moved look.\n\"With this, the only time I'll see His Highness on stage is at the graduation ceremony…\"\nJust before the graduation ceremony, the student council members will have a handover.\nThe next time Felix stands on stage, it will not be as student council president, but as representative of the graduating students.\nFor Cyril, who has always supported Felix, there must be a deep sense of emotion.\n…His Highness is loved by many people.\nEven though some people say he is a puppet prince in the shadows, most of the students at this school respect and admire the prince named Felix Ark Ridill.\n…And yet, I'm trying to expose His Highness's secret because I might find out the truth about my father's death…\nEven if she knew all of his secrets, Monica didn't think she would make them public. This is just something Monica is investigating because she wants to know.\n…But still, there is a sense of guilt in trying to touch the other side of Felix- or rather, Eig.\n\"…Cyril, you really respect His Highness, don't you?\"\nAt Monica's murmur, Cyril shifted his gaze from Felix to Monica.\n\"Of course. Being recognized by him is my greatest pride.\"\nWhat kind of face would Cyril make if he knew Felix's secret?\nFor Cyril, the fact that he was recognized by Felix, a member of the royal family, is a force that inspires him.\nExposing Felix's secret would also rob Cyril's pride.\n…I want Cyril to remain ignorant.\nThere's not much time left until the graduation ceremony. Monica doesn't have much time to spend at this school.\nMonica wanted to spend the remaining precious time not as the Silent Witch, but as Monica Norton.\n…When she knew the truth, the Silent Witch would keep everything to herself and not say a word.\nThat's what Monica was thinking at this time.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nWhile the students who attended the student general meeting were returning to their classrooms one by one, the student council members were busy cleaning up the site and meeting with the club presidents.\nFelix and Elliot are busy with future meetings with teachers and club presidents. Neil is busy with the direction of the site cleanup, so naturally, the remaining three, Cyril, Bridget, and Monica, who have free hands, were in charge of cleaning up the materials.\nMonica, while rolling up the large material paper, glanced at Bridget from the corner of her eye.\nSince returning to school, Bridget has not touched on the matter of the infiltration investigation at all. Even though there must be many things she is thinking about, Bridget has been behaving bravely as usual. That seemed a little painful to Monica.\nBridget is a strong, beautiful, and above all, wise woman.\nEven when faced with a cruel reality, she continued to behave bravely, like the heroine of a novel that Isabelle likes.\nBut, while the heroine of the novel is finally united with her loved one, Bridget's feelings are probably never rewarded.\n\"The materials are all sorted. Let's take them to the student council room first.\"\nSaying that Cyril stood up with the biggest box in his hand. Monica also hurriedly gathered as much of the bundle of materials next to her as she could. Bridget also silently lifted a bundle of materials.\nAs the three of them were heading to the student council room, they saw a female student coming down the stairs from above. The female student, who was carrying luggage, gave way to Cyril and the others.\nCyril and Bridget walked ahead, and as Monica was about to follow them, the female student who had given way came a little closer to Monica and put a small folded piece of paper in Monica's uniform pocket.\n……….huh?\nMonica instinctively looked up and saw the face of the female student.\nThe girl with neat black hair and a cool demeanor, who slipped the paper into Monica's pocket, was none other than Heidi. Monica recognized her not only by her appearance but also by the slightly thick eyebrows above her slanted eyes.\n\"…Ah.\"\nWhen Monica turned around, Heidi quickly descended the stairs and turned the corner in the hallway.\nMonica, who had stopped on the stairs, followed Heidi's figure with her eyes, and Cyril called out to her from the top of the stairs with a puzzled expression.\n\"Treasurer Norton?\"\n\"Ah, sorry. It's nothing.\"\nAs Monica climbed the stairs, she used one hand to support her documents and used the other hand to take out the piece of paper from her pocket.\nThere, it was succinctly written:\n——\"Tonight, wait at the entrance of the forest behind the school.\"\nThere was no turning back now.\nIt was finally time to confront the ‘horrifying truth.'",

      "content": "That night, Monica peered out of the attic room window, her nerves on edge.\n\"…It requires courage to climb out of the window, doesn't it, Nero?\"\n\"Just close your eyes and jump all at once, and it won't be as frightening.\"\n\"…I can't. If I close my eyes, I won't be able to calculate the precise timing for landing…\"\nMonica had planned to sneak out of the attic room that night and make her way to the forest, following Heidi's instructions. However, even the journey from the attic room to the forest posed a challenge.\nBeing one of the Seven Sages did not change the fact that jumping from a great height was a terrifying prospect. If the high-ranking wind spirit, Lynn, had been present, Monica might have easily overcome this problem. But she couldn't rely on Lynn's assistance and had to manage on her own.\nShe had been secretly practicing flying magic for some time, but she still struggled to maintain balance. This was a result of Monica's motor nerves. Above all, she found it difficult to coordinate her body movements while focusing on a magic spell.\nAs Monica repeated to herself, \"Alright, let's go, let's go,\" Nero hopped onto the windowsill and gazed up at her.\n\"Are you certain it's alright for me not to accompany you? You're going to meet that eerie, squishy guy, correct?\"\n\"…Yes, I'll be fine. Nero, you stay here.\"\nMonica spoke firmly, and Nero narrowed his golden eyes, darker than the moon.\n\"After all, I am your familiar. If you encounter any trouble, make sure to call me. I will crush and sweep away anything that stands in your way.\"\nIn the past, Monica might have flinched and remarked, \"Your words sound excessively ruthless…\" But now, Nero's presence provided her with an odd sense of security.\nDuring Nero's hibernation, Monica experienced loneliness for various reasons.\n\"Thank you, Nero. Yes… I'll be relying on you.\"\n\"Not just relying, but depending on me.\"\n\"Yes…\"\nThe phrase \"learn to rely on others\" had been repeated to Monica countless times by Cyril Ashley.\nThough she still harbored fear when it came to seeking help from others, Monica was gradually beginning to change.\n\"It's alright. I believe… I can bring myself to ask for assistance.\"\nThose words were partially meant for herself.\nNero smiled contentedly and gently patted Monica's hand with his paw.\n\"Very well. Go!\"\n\"Yes!\"\nMonica placed her foot on the windowsill and leaped down. As she activated her chantless magic, she felt the cool breeze of the spring night envelop her entire body.\nA powerful gust of wind embraced Monica and gently cushioned her landing.\nAlthough she bounced a bit too forcefully on the cushion of wind, causing her to stumble upon touching the ground, she quickly regained her footing and brushed off the dirt from her clothes.\nLet's go… From this point onward, the real challenge begins.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAt the designated entrance to the forest, Heidi awaited Monica, dressed in her Serendia Academy uniform.\n\"I've been waiting for your arrival. This way, please.\"\nHeidi proceeded into the depths of the forest, holding a lantern in one hand. Monica silently followed behind her.\nAs the cold spring night wind rustled through the forest, the swaying trees concealed the moon that hung in the night sky.\nHeidi walked confidently along an unmarked path until she finally halted in front of a towering Zelkova tree.\nDangling from the tree was a striking young man with golden hair, Felix Ark Ridill.\nHowever, Monica immediately discerned that it was someone else.\n\"Please cease your impersonation of someone I know.\"\n\"Oh, come now, isn't it fitting since we're about to discuss ‘him'? There is no other visage that suits this setting, is there?\"\nWith the same countenance as Felix, Yuan chuckled.\nAt the sound of his honeyed, scorched voice, Monica furrowed her brow slightly, and Yuan raised the corners of his lips, revealing a grin that Felix would never wear.\n\"Well, let's see if your information is accurate. First, I would like to hear your information, Monica Everett, the Silent Witch.\"\nMonica pondered what to say but realized that beating around the bush was futile. She chose to ask directly.\n\"Do you know Arthuur, the doctor?\"\n\"An old friend and traitor who, alongside me, delved into the study of body modification magic in the empire. A scoundrel who pilfered my research findings and fled to a neighboring country.\"\n\"That man fled the empire over a decade ago. By that time, your body modification magic was already perfected… Am I correct?\"\nYuan narrowed his eyes like a cat and tilted his slender neck.\n\"Indeed! As a reward, would you like me to kiss you with this face?\"\n\"I'll pass…\"\nThree years ago, when the emperor was replaced, the empire lifted the ban on body modification magic.\nUntil then, body modification magic was also treated as forbidden magic in the empire. That's why Yuan didn't make his research results public… But there was a man who brought them out.\nThat man was Arthuur, the doctor known as Arthur in the Duchy of Crockford.\n\"I've been pursuing that detestable man for a long time… And a year ago, I finally discovered that he was hiding in the Duchy of Crockford… But he was already deceased.\"\nYuan's eyes, which were just a few seconds ago the same blue as Felix's, began to change. They clouded over, resembling moss growing on a rock. Eventually, they transformed into an unfathomable black.\n\"And while investigating the cause of Arthuur's death, I… No, more accurately, my master noticed something.\"\n\"……\"\n\"My master is an astute individual. He instructed me to delve into the matter. I approached Felix Ark Ridill through the chess tournament and the school festival to verify this fact.\"\nYuan then shifted his gaze towards Monica. It was now Monica's turn to speak.\nMonica took a deep breath and began to speak.\n\"Ten years ago… there was another victim who perished alongside Arthuur in the fire incident… He was a servant of His Highness Felix at the time, by the name of Isaac Walker.\"\nBridget mentioned that Felix held him in high regard, like a brother, the young man with a scar next to his right eye.\n\"…He did not die ten years ago. So whose body was discovered at the scene of the fire?\"\nThere is only one answer to that.\n\"…It was the real Prince Felix.\"\nThe fate of Felix Ark Ridill, as foretold by the stars, remained unseen even with the power of the Star Oracle Witch for the past decade.\nOf course. The true second prince had already perished during that time.\nMonica attempted to swallow her saliva but failed. Her mouth was dry, and she lacked sufficient saliva to swallow.\nAfter taking another deep breath, Monica revealed the truth of ten years ago with parched lips.\n\"…Ten years ago, for some reason, the real Felix passed away. Thus, under the command of the Duke of Crockford, the doctor, Arthuur performed body modification magic on Felix's servant, Isaac Walker… to make him resemble the prince.\"\nIt was not unreasonable for Bridget to have overlooked this fact.\nTo the people of the Ridill Kingdom, body modification magic was a distant tale. Even Monica, who was aware of its existence, did not believe that the technology to alter one's appearance had been perfected a decade ago.\n…Eig, that was Isaac's nickname.\nMonica was acquainted with a young man named Eig. That is why she was able to discern this truth.\n\"…And the duke killed Arthuur to silence him, and burned the body of the true prince, who had perished alongside him in the fire.\"\nMonica suppressed the urge to bow her head and looked directly at Yuan.\n\"You approached him… to confirm his identity, didn't you? A skilled magic user can detect traces of magic when in close proximity.\"\nYuan clapped his hands theatrically and laughed like a child, exclaiming, \"Well done.\"\n\"The answers have been revealed. Now it is time for the deal.\"\nIndeed, now that the truth of the past had been unveiled, what mattered was the \"future.\"\nYuan and Heidi were individuals from the empire. Currently, the Ridill Kingdom and the empire were not in a hostile relationship… However, the Duke of Crockford was attempting to incite a war.\nCreating a casus belli was a simple task. For instance, they could blame the empire for the recent influx of dragons into the Ridill Kingdom due to land development.\n\"What do you intend to do… with this truth?\"\n\"Of course, we will expose it. And we will do so immediately after Felix Ark Ridill ascends to the throne.\"\nMonica's face turned pale.\nUndoubtedly, that was the worst possible time for the truth to come to light.\nTo Monica, who was growing pale, Yuan spoke with a smile.\n\"Naturally, we will not make the announcement in the name of the empire… All we need to do is reveal the truth, along with the evidence, to the anti-Duke Crockford faction among the nobles of the Ridill Kingdom… Perhaps the Count of Bright would be suitable?\"\nThe Count of Bright. He was Keith's father, who had once conspired to assassinate Felix.\nWhy was Keith's father's name being mentioned here? The reason became clear with a little thought.\n\"We have connections with the nobles in the Ridill Kingdom… To be precise, through the Randall Kingdom.\"\nThe Randall Kingdom was a small country situated between the two dominant powers of the Ridill Kingdom and the empire. For the past few decades, they have managed to maintain a neutral position, avoiding any conflicts. However, it appeared that they were now leaning towards the empire.\nYuan devised a plan to reveal the truth about the \"fake second prince\" to the anti- Duke Crockford faction in the Ridill Kingdom, using the Randall Kingdom as a conduit.\nIt was not difficult to envision that this revelation would create internal strife within the Ridill Kingdom.\nThe empire could weaken the Ridill Kingdom without deploying a single soldier.\n\"Ah, I must mention that even if you were to eliminate Heidi and me here, it would be futile… As I mentioned earlier, my master possesses exceptional foresight… Tell me, do you comprehend why I agreed to your session of questions?\"\nYuan regarded Monica with a slightly pitying gaze.\n\"…Because once you discover the truth, there is nothing you can do.\"\nIndeed, just as Yuan had stated.\nThe empire had become aware of Felix's true identity as an impostor. Undoubtedly, they possessed evidence at the ready… All they needed to do was expose the truth when Felix ascended to the throne.\n…And Monica had no means to prevent it.\n\"Hey, Miss Silent Witch. My master has a proposition for you.\"\nAs Monica looked up skeptically, Yuan spoke in a coaxing tone.\n\"Why not join our side?\"\n\"…Huh?\"\nTaken aback by these unexpected words, Monica's eyes widened, and Yuan playfully winked at her.\n\"The primary reason we accepted your invitation is this. Our master… The emperor wishes to extend an invitation to you.\"\nYuan extended his hand towards Monica.\nThe hand that had taken countless lives, stained with blood, swayed and beckoned to Monica.\n\"Instead of witnessing the decline of the Ridill Kingdom, why not come to our empire, Monica Everett, the Silent Witch?\"",

      "content": "The girl had a face so ugly it was as if she were a monster.\nAt some point, she had heard a skilled makeup artist boast that they could make anyone beautiful with makeup. But the girl, who had realized the limits of makeup early on, knew all too well that there were things that just couldn't be helped, no matter how much makeup was used.\nThe girl's face was ugly. It was so ugly that it could be called atrocious. Her eyes were constantly swollen and half-hidden, her skin was rough and covered in unpleasant rashes, her nose was barely there, and her lips were distorted.\nThe girl was abandoned in the red-light district of the southeastern part of the empire when she was still young. There was no need to even think about why her parents had abandoned her. Who would want to be with a child who had such a monstrously ugly face?\nTo survive, the girl walked around the red-light district and begged the adults to take her in, saying she would do anything. The one who picked her up was the owner of a certain brothel. He allowed her to work as a maid and sleep in the storage room.\nFrom that day on, the girl worked frantically. No matter how grueling the physical labor, no matter how cold the water in the winter, she did her work silently and efficiently. Occasionally, when a prostitute died of a contagious disease, she would be tasked with taking care of the body in exchange for a few of the deceased's clothes and belongings.\nOne day, she received a book and a piece of clothing from a dead prostitute's belongings. In order to read the book, she asked a beggar who claimed to be a scholar to teach her how to read.\nThe book was a popular novel. It was about a princess who had been cursed by a wicked witch and turned ugly, but who overcame her trials and broke the curse, eventually marrying a prince.\nThe girl identified herself with the cursed princess in the story and immersed herself in reading the book. She dreamed that one day a prince would appear and lift her curse, even though she knew it was just a fantasy.\nBut even so, the fantasy allowed her to forget, if only for a little while, the pain of being stared at strangely by those around her.\nThe princess in the story never gave up, no matter how much she was ridiculed for her ugliness. She was always kind to everyone and remained true to herself, behaving with dignity as a princess should. That was why the prince noticed her.\nThe girl decided that she, too, wanted to be like that. So, she began to gradually improve her behavior from that day on. No matter how exhausted she was, she always maintained a good posture. No matter how grueling the work she was ordered to do, her voice was always beautiful in response.\nWhen she saw upper-class customers, she carefully observed their pronunciation and behavior and imitated them. She practiced popular songs and dances in her spare time.\nThe prostitutes in the brothel made fun of her, but the girl was used to being made fun of, and their mockery didn't bother her at all.\nWhen the girl turned thirteen, the owner of the brothel ordered her to take customers. The brothel was fairly popular, and there were times when the hands of the prostitutes were not enough. At such times, the girl was ordered to act as a filler until the other prostitutes were free.\nHowever, the girl's job was different from that of the beautiful prostitutes in the brothel who poured drinks for the customers and performed songs and dances. She was simply embraced by the male customers in one of the empty rooms, with a bag over her head.\n\"Ah, dear customer, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. If you'd like, would you mind spending some time with this girl until your favorite girl is free? Of course, the price is reasonable. It's just a little service for our regular customers who always patronize us. This girl's face can't be seen, but her body is young and beautiful. Please, do as you like with her.\"\nThe owner said this and brought the male customers to the girl.\nThe girl had planned to entertain the customers with conversation, and to perform songs and dances, however poorly, just like the other prostitutes in the brothel. But the men didn't want anything like that. To them, the girl with the bag over her head was no different from an object.\nThe girl was treated as nothing more than a source of comfort for the men, without even the courtesy of being treated like a human being. She couldn't show off her hard-earned education, songs, or dances at all.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"Why are you wearing a bag over your head?\" asked a certain customer.\nThe girl with the bag over her head couldn't see the man's face. All she could see through the rough opening in the bag was a faint hint of the room's light and darkness.\nHowever, from his voice, she could tell that he was still a relatively young man. His words had a slight foreign accent, and he spoke in a strangely feminine way as if he were trying to cover it up. He was a strange customer.\nHe was probably new to this brothel. If he was a regular, he would know about the \"bag girl\" at this brothel.\n\"…I have an extremely ugly face, so I cover it like this.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nThe girl could tell that the man was approaching her on the bed. She thought he was going to touch her clothes, but instead, he grabbed the edge of the bag. The girl hurriedly tried to hold the bag in place.\n\"I wouldn't recommend looking, sir. It might ruin your mood and make you not want to hold me.\"\n\"It's okay… Hey…\"\nThe man whispered sweetly and stroked the girl's cheek through the bag.\n\"Shall we compare?\"\nWith a sudden opening of her vision, the girl could feel the wind on her cheek. The man quickly removed the bag.\nThe man who had taken the girl's bag was a man with black hair, black eyes, and a plain face. His face was not commonly seen in this country, so he was probably a foreigner.\nBut the girl didn't think his face was ugly at all. It was a clean and refreshing face.\n…But in the next moment, the man's face began to change. His healthy skin turned red and black and rotted away. His lips twisted, revealing his teeth.\n\"Hiiek…!?\"\nThe girl instinctively recoiled, and the man covered his face with both hands. Then, as if kneading dough, he began to reshape his own face. The skin on his forehead wrinkled and distorted, and the red and black rotten skin was covered with healthy skin.\nEventually, his bones realigned and his flesh took shape… and he became a different man. The girl knew this man's face well. He was the owner of this brothel.\n\"A long time ago,  I was falsely accused of a crime and the lord had hot oil poured on my face. I was so humiliated and angry that I taught myself how to reconstruct my face… Do you think it turned out well?\"\nThe man said this and reshaped his face back into the plain man's face.\nThe girl was captivated by this strange and miraculous sight. The man seemed to sense her feelings and laughed softly, stroking her cheek again, this time directly, not through the bag. He stroked her cheek, covered in rashes.\n\"…Would you like me to do it for you, too?\"\nThe girl trembled her swollen lips.\n\"…Can you do it?\"\n\"When used on someone else, this technique can only be used once. If you use it more than that, you'll die of magical poisoning…\"\nThe man said this and extended his hand to the girl. Perhaps this was the first time anyone had ever extended their hand to her like this. The girl swallowed her saliva and placed her hand on top of the man's.\nThe man smiled slightly.\n\"Your pronunciation is beautiful. And your posture is good… I happened to be looking for a well-behaved servant…\"\nThe man took the girl's hand and stood up, then called out to the owner. He took out a few gold coins from his pocket and handed them to the owner.\n\"I'm going to take this girl with me. Is that all right?\"\nThe owner was so surprised and delighted that he almost jumped up. Gold coins had been paid for this girl, who wasn't even worth a single copper coin. The owner rubbed his hands together and said, \"Please, do as you like,\" bowing his head repeatedly.\nThe man said as he walked,\n\"Oh, I forgot to ask your name. I'm Yuan. What's yours?\"\nIt's been a long time since anyone asked her name. The men who hold the bag girl don't care about anything other than her body. They don't care about her face, her name, her education.\n\"…My name is Heidi.\"\n\"That's a cute name. Nice to meet you, Heidi.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nHeidi, who had flesh manipulation magic performed on her by Yuan, was reborn. Her swollen eyes became clear, her rough skin became smooth, her nose bridge became defined, and her lips took on a beautiful shape. She wasn't the type of beauty that would turn heads, but she had a cool and refreshing, yet slightly immature charm that was fitting for a girl her age.\nHowever, there was one part of her remade face that Heidi was a little concerned about. Her eyebrows. Her slightly thick eyebrows were the only feature that remained unchanged, still asserting their presence above her eyes.\nThinking about shaping them a little, Heidi picked up a razor, but Yuan said to her,\n\"Oh, are you going to shave them? That's a waste. They're so cute.\"\nHeidi put down the razor. Of course, her current face was cute. After all, it had been remade to not be unsightly. But this was the first time someone had called a part of her that hadn't changed cute.\n\"…Are they cute?\"\n\"I've thought so since I took the bag off. Oh, those cute eyebrows.\"\nHeidi silently stroked her eyebrows and quietly put away the razor.",

      "content": "Special mention to Thomas Elliott. Thank you so much for the generous donation!🙇🙇\nI changed \"Eig\" to \"Ike\" to make it more sense since it was abbreviated from Isaac.\nAnyway, here's a bonus chapter.\nThe night's entertainment district was as bustling as when Monica had visited before… no, it was even more lively than that time. It seems that when spring comes, people tend to get excited and want to go out to the city.\nWhen the women who attract customers smile seductively, men flock to them like moths drawn to streetlights. The ones who flock to these men are street vendors carrying goods. If a street vendor calls out, \"How about a unique hair ornament?\" young girls raise their voices in delight with high-pitched cheers.\nWhile watching such a scene from the corner of her eye, Monica was walking quickly through the night city, relying on her scant memories.\nEventually, the hustle and bustle fade away, and if you pass through a particularly dark and narrow road in the night city, you will see the sign of \"Porter's Antique Bookstore\".\nMonica took a deep breath once and opened the door to the bookstore. The creaking sound of the door was the same sound she heard when she came before.\nIn the dimly lit store, bookshelves were arranged at regular intervals. Monica walked between the second and third shelves, remembering the time when she was brought here by Felix.\nThere were no other customers in the store, and at the counter in the back, the shop owner, Porter, was writing in the same posture as before.\nThe shop owner, with his dark skin and black hair, seemed to have mixed foreign blood, making it difficult to determine his age.\nHowever, he looked convincing enough to be said to be of the same generation as Monica's father.\n\"Good evening.\"\nEven when Monica called out, Porter did not stop his handwriting. The almond-shaped black eyes behind his glasses remained fixed on the paper.\nBut it seemed that Monica's voice was not unheard. While moving his quill pen smoothly, Porter opened his mouth reluctantly.\n\"It took longer than I thought. Did I glue it too firmly?\"\n\"…No, I found the memo right away, but… I didn't immediately understand what the Black Chalice meant.\"\nPorter stopped the hand moving his quill pen and finally looked up at Monica.\nHis slightly darkened eyes lazily reflected Monica, and he muttered as if he understood, \"Ah.\"\n\"I thought it was a simple cipher that anyone who read my novel would understand… but come to think of it, you were a child who didn't read novels. You've always been reading math books.\"\n\"Have we… met before?\"\n\"Ah, it's a story from when your father was alive.\"\nPorter returned his quill pen to the pen stand and wiped his ink-stained hand with a handkerchief.\n\"Well, if we're going to talk about old times, shall we make some coffee? Please sit anywhere you like.\"\nEven if he told her to sit, there were no chairs in the bookstore besides the one on which the shop owner sat.\nMonica looked around and found a small footstool, which she sat down on as a chair.\nPorter retreated into what seemed to be a small living space in the back of the shop, and after a while, he returned with a tray in his hand. On the tray were two cups and a silver pot… Monica recognized that pot.\n\"That pot is…\"\nIt was exactly the same as the memento of her father that Monica cherished.\nPorter poured coffee into the cup and handed it to Monica.\n\"It's something I asked your father to make. This is the best for staying up late.\"\nIndeed, this man was a friend of her father's.\nThinking about that again, Monica accepted the cup.\nPorter sat down in the chair in front of the counter, took a sip of coffee, and exhaled.\n\"Well, where should I start the story… Have you already read ‘The Adventures of Bartholomew Alexander?'\"\n\"Just the fourteenth chapter of the fifth volume…\"\nPorter tilted his cup and wrinkled his nose.\n\"It's like reading only the mystery-solving part of a detective novel. As an author, I wanted you to read from the first volume.\"\n\"I'm, I'm sorry… I'm not good at… reading novels.\"\n\"So, what did you think after reading it?\"\nThe plot of \"The Adventures of Bartholomew Alexander\" Volume 5, Chapter 14, \"Bartholomew Alexander and the Black Chalice\" is as follows.\nBartholomew, along with his partner Abram, visits a certain kingdom and gets involved in the kingdom's succession problem.\nThere was a national treasure called the Black Chalice in that country, but the Black Chalice was stolen by someone. So the king tells his five sons and daughters that whoever finds this Black Chalice will be the king.\nHowever, the one who hid this Black Chalice was none other than the first prince, who was considered the most likely candidate for the king.\nThe Black Chalice is a mysterious treasure that glows red when the blood of the royal family is poured into it.\nHowever, the first prince was the illegitimate child of the queen and not the king's child. Therefore, he stole the Black Chalice to hide this fact.\nRealizing this truth, Bartholomew, in cooperation with Princess Mariabelle, finds the hidden Black Chalice and presents it to the king.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n──What kind of technology was it made with? Was it carved out of the highest quality onyx, or was it melted and solidified from the scales of a black dragon? The intricately decorated chalice, the cup, the handle, the decoration, everything was made of the highest quality pure black.\nWhen Princess Mariabelle drops a drop of her own blood into the cup, the jet-black chalice begins to seep red from the part where the blood touches. As if the Black Chalice had sucked up the blood, the chalice turned red from the part where the blood touched and eventually became a Crimson Chalice.\nThe king sees this and declares in a loud voice.\n\"Princess Mariabelle, you who have dyed the Black Chalice crimson have been proven to be a rightful descendant of the king's blood. Now, rebellious prince, you too should prove here with your blood that you are a member of the royal family!\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThe first prince, who was the illegitimate child born between the queen and another man, could not dye the chalice crimson with his blood and perished… that's the general flow of the story.\nBut what's important to Monica is not the story or the characters, but the role of the Black Chalice.\nMonica thinks that the Black Chalice that appears in this story is a kind of magic tool that changes color in response to the blood of a specific bloodline.\nAnd this Black Chalice is the reason why Monica's father, Benedict Rain, was executed.\n\"…My father was trying to make this ‘Black Chalice', wasn't he?\"\nMonica's father was researching the hereditary nature of mana.\nHuman mana is basically inherited. Specifically, it is the preferred attributes and the amount of mana.\nThe preferred attribute is always one of the parents' preferred attributes, and if the parents have a lot of mana, the child will also have a lot of mana.\nHe was trying to analyze this mechanism.\n\"More precisely, what my father wanted to make was a magic tool that reads genetic information, modeled after this Black Chalice. By analyzing and analyzing the collected blood, it is possible to investigate the presence or absence of genetic diseases and blood relationships… that's what I think.\"\nThis is a technology that is useful for the treatment of genetic diseases and for matching when an unidentified body is found.\nBut a certain person who saw this research content thought the same thing as the \"rebellious prince\".\n──If we can investigate blood relationships, it will be revealed that the king and the second prince are not blood-related.\nTherefore, that person… The Duke of Crockford manipulated things from behind the scenes and had Benedict Rain executed for a crime.\nAll to make Felix Ark Ridill, a fake prince, the king.\nMonica clenched the coffee cup in both hands and glared at her feet. If she didn't do that, she felt like she would be swallowed up by the passion inside her.\nPorter told Monica, who was looking down, in a matter-of-fact tone.\n\"The episode of the Black Chalice is based on the folklore of a small country in the East. Originally, it was folklore about a \"black jewel that glows red by sucking the blood of a royal family\". When I made it into a novel, I arranged it into the form of a chalice… Ah, why do you think I made it into the form of a chalice?\"\nWhen Monica looked at Porter with a puzzled face, Porter lifted the corner of his mouth slightly and showed her the coffee pot.\n\"It's because of this thing. When I was thinking about the plot, this pot that I got from your father caught my eye. When I was looking at the pot filled with black coffee, I suddenly came up with the idea of a black chalice.\"\nThe custom-made metal pot that Monica's father loved to use was long vertically, and the central joint was narrowed, so it did resemble the shape of a cup to some extent.\nWhen Monica thought that the Black Chalice, which she couldn't find no matter how much she searched, was near Monica in the form of a novel and a coffee pot, it felt ironic.\nMonica finished the coffee in her cup and opened her mouth, staring at Porter.\n\"Mr. Porter…What do you know, and how much do you know?\"\nPorter seemed to understand why Monica's father was executed.\nIn other words… he knows. Now, the second prince, who is calling himself Felix Ark Ridill, is a fake.\nBut did Porter know whether Ike was that second prince?\nThe flame of the candlestick in Porter’s hand flickered, illuminating his gloomy face.\n“If I said ‘everything’… would you despise me, who knew everything but did nothing for my best friend, and just watched?”\nPorter’s voice was quiet and monotonous, but a slight sense of guilt was seeping into the depths.\nThis person is… just like me.\nMonica slowly shook her head.\n“…No. I couldn’t do anything either.”\n“‘Did nothing’ and ‘could do nothing’ are similar but different. The circumstances are different between you, who were young at the time, and me, an adult who knew everything.”\n“…I think there’s not much difference between adults and children in front of the Duke of Crockford’s power.”\nPorter probably didn’t do nothing. At least he moved in his own way, collecting information to uncover the truth about his friend’s death.\nBut when faced with the truth he had arrived at, he must have been able to do nothing but stand still.\n“The second prince is an impostor. The Duke of Crockford executed Benedict Rain, who was conducting inconvenient research for him, to hide that.”\n…Who would believe such an absurd story?\n“I was surprised when the prince, who was the cause of my friend’s death, visited this shop hiding his identity. Ah, yes. I was surprised, but I did nothing. I did nothing. I was just a bystander. Until the day I die, I thought I would remain a bystander for the rest of my life, scattering my delusions on paper like this…”\nThe black eyes behind his glasses stared at Monica.\n“That fake prince brought you here. The man who caused my friend’s death brought my friend’s daughter. I thought it was a nightmare.”\nThat’s when the bystander moved off his own accord for the first time.\nHe quickly wrote cryptic characters on the edge of the manuscript paper. And tucked it into the back of the book.\n“…Mr. Porter, you’re amazing. Collecting information on your own, deducing, and getting this far…”\nPorter glared at Monica and pointed the tip of his quill at Monica’s forehead. As if he were pointing the tip of a knife.\n“This is not deduction or anything. There’s no evidence, no conviction, just a novelist’s delusion. Do you understand? You’re listening to my delusion right now.”\nPorter cut off his words and furrowed his brow just a little… really just a little.\n“So don’t think of recklessly opposing the Duke of Crockford.”\nThat was probably his clumsy way of caring.\nBut Monica, who had made a promise with the emperor of the neighboring country, could no longer be a bystander. If Monica does nothing, this country will either go to war with the empire or be devastated by civil war.\nMonica opened her mouth, staring at the pen tip pointed at her forehead.\n“I… I could only watch as my father was executed.”\nThe words “my father is not bad” stuck in her throat, and Monica could not raise her voice but just watched as her father was burned and died. She burned the numbers of the books that were burned with her father’s body into her eyes.\n“I don’t know what I can do… but—”\nMonica cast a wind spell without chanting.\nThe quill slipped out from between Porter’s fingers and began to spin in the air on its own. To the surprised Porter, Monica quietly told him.\n“—I think I can do more than I could back then.”\nPorter’s black eyes behind his glasses widened, looking at the quill and Monica.\nApparently, he knew the true identity of Felix, but he didn’t seem to know what happened to his friend’s daughter afterward.\nMonica plucked the quill floating in the air and smiled awkwardly.\n“Because I am… the Silent Witch.”\nWhile pretending to be strong in an unfamiliar way, Monica thought in the back of her head.\nAh, does Ike know that a researcher was killed to make him king?\nIf he knows, what does he think of the researcher’s death?\nWhat would he look like if I told him, “My father died to make you king?”\nI… want to talk to him.",

      "content": "Among the Seven Sages of the Kingdom of Ridill, Emanuel Darwin, the Jeweled Magician, has three favorite things: After-dinner tea, gold, and power.\nHowever, this morning, the usual tea leaves were unavailable, and he went without tea after breakfast.\nTo cap it off, the magic tool workshop he runs experienced a rent increase, one of his apprentices was poached by another workshop, and sales were in the red.\nWith an indescribable rage stirring within him, Emanuel made his way to the luncheon venue.\nHe had been invited to lunch this day by Second Prince Felix Ark Ridill.\nThe venue was a high-class restaurant in an upscale neighborhood halfway between the royal capital and the Selendia Academy.\nThe meal was something to look forward to, but more than anything, Emanuel was thrilled to have been summoned by the prince rumored to be the next king.\nCompared with the politically inept First Prince and the lackluster Third Prince, the Second Prince was a capable man.\nSupported by the influential Duke of Crockford, he had a wealth of diplomatic achievements and, moreover, valiant military exploits as the slayer of the dreaded cursed dragon. It was as if all the necessary arrangements were already in place.\nEmanuel had been cozying up to the Duke of Crockford and receiving various forms of patronage, but his interactions with the Second Prince, whom the duke supported, had been limited. He had tried to close the distance at social gatherings, but no matter what he did, he found himself treated no differently from the other nobles, which left him perpetually dissatisfied.\nUpon arriving at the fancy restaurant, Emanuel was guided to a private room in the back.\nPrince Felix was already seated. Upon noticing Emanuel’s arrival, Felix lifted his face and offered him a polite smile.\n“Greetings, Lord Darwin.”\n“Thank you very much for inviting me today.”\n“Please, the thanks are mine. Take a seat.”\nAt his invitation, Emanuel took a seat as a servant promptly poured an aperitif into his glass. Sipping the fine red wine, Emanuel began to consider how he might ingratiate himself with Felix.\nThough the Seven Sages were said to serve as advisors to His Majesty, in actuality, it was only the Star Oracle Witch who primarily fulfilled that role for the current king. Astonishingly, the others had little interest in state affairs.\nEmanuel always believed that he should be the one chosen, but the current king, heavily influenced by the Duke of Crockford, refused to appoint him as an advisor.\nThat's why Emanuel wanted to cultivate a close relationship with the second prince, who would be the next king. If he could make himself indispensable to Felix, he would be able to become the king's advisor in both name and reality. He would be able to rise above the other Seven Sages and become a truly influential figure.\nHe decided it would be safest to touch on the topic of the cursed dragon incident and praise Felix’s heroics… Just as he was forming this plan in his mind, Felix set down his wine glass and opened his mouth.\n“Oh, right. I visited Lord Darwin’s workshop the other day. It was quite an impressive operation.”\nRather than being pleased, Emanuel was seized by a sudden anxiety at Felix’s words. He had received no notice of the prince’s visit to his workshop. Perhaps it had been a secret inspection?\n“Indeed, your reputation as the Jeweled Magician is no exaggeration. I was thoroughly impressed by the remarkable magic tools on display. Not only were their functions extraordinary, but their aesthetics were exquisite as well. Your apprentices are exceptionally skilled, it seems.”\nFelix continued to gush about the marvels of the workshop, but Emanuel couldn’t help but feel increasingly restless.\n“Well, I’m honored by your praise.”\nHe managed a laugh, but it came out forced and unnatural. As he struggled to maintain a semblance of composure, Felix produced something from his pocket and placed it on the table.\nIt was a topaz brooch with delicate engravings.\n“By the way, Lord Darwin, do you happen to recognize this brooch?”\n“Let me see… It appears to be a magic tool, but… Pardon me.”\nEmanuel used a silk handkerchief to pick up the brooch and examined the engraved magic formula. His eyes widened in surprise.\nIt was customary to engrave the name of the creator on magic tools that were sold in the market. Signed pieces commanded a far higher price than unsigned ones.\nAnd the name engraved on this brooch was Emanuel Darwin.\n“Your Highness… Where did you…”\n“I purchased it at a certain street stall. The shopkeeper claimed it was made by the Jeweled Magician himself. However, the magic formula employed was rather crude for an item of that supposed origin.”\nA cold sweat trickled down Emanuel’s back.\nStill, he put on his best act of confusion.\n“Oh my, how strange. Of late, there have been unscrupulous individuals who have been engraving my name on inferior magic tools to make a profit. It’s become quite vexing, really—especially since the ones behind this scheme seem to be unlicensed artisans who aren’t members of any guild…”\n“The shopkeeper who sold me this brooch said it was secondhand, so I later dispatched an underling to investigate its origins. The original owner I identified in this manner claims to have purchased it directly from the Darwin Workshop.”\nEmanuel’s face tightened, but he forced a smile.\n“Well, that must be some sort of misunderstanding. The Darwin Workshop only handles first-rate products! Such inferior magic tools as these…”\n“When was the last time you personally crafted a magic tool, Lord Darwin?”\nFelix’s smile remained unchanged. Yet, the very air around him seemed to grow colder.\n…A gentle smile transformed into an icy one.\n“I believe one of your apprentices testified that you haven’t made a single magic tool with your own hands in years. That you’ve been having your apprentices make them and simply signing your name before putting them up for sale… Apparently, that apprentice couldn’t bear the pangs of conscience and has since moved on to another workshop.”\nIt was precisely that apprentice who had been poached by another workshop that had been the cause of Emanuel’s recent frustrations.\nBut how could Felix have knowledge of this?\n“Forgive me, but I don’t quite understand what you’re implying…”\n“If this is true, your workshop will be shut down and your position among the Seven Sages will be in jeopardy, wouldn’t it?”\nEmanuel’s forehead beaded with sweat as he frantically searched for an excuse.\n“…I have no idea what you’re talking about…”\n“Lord Darwin, would you be so kind as to do me a small favor?”\nFelix produced a small bottle from his pocket. It was so small that he could conceal it within the palm of his hand. A colorless liquid sloshed around inside the bottle.\n“Please, give this to the Duke of Crockford to drink.”\nIt was obvious that the liquid was harmful to the human body. Felix was essentially ordering Emanuel: If you value your seat among the Seven Sages, cooperate with me and poison the Duke of Crockford.\nBut while Emanuel sought favor with Felix, he had no intention of doing his bidding.\nThe nerve of this greenhorn, making such demands!\nRefusing to be intimidated, he suppressed his agitation and laughed heartily.\n“Hahaha! Regrettably, your grandfather—the Duke of Crockford—has given his tacit approval to this arrangement. The fact is that I have been rather busy and haven’t been able to devote myself solely to creating magic tools.”\nDue to his busy schedule of patron meetings and social gatherings, Emanuel had hardly made any magic tools himself in the past several years. That was why he had been having his apprentices make them and simply signing his name before selling them.\nAnd the Duke of Crockford was aware of this. Despite knowing, he continued to provide Emanuel with patronage. Supporting the Seven Sages was advantageous to the duke.\nEven if Felix were to expose this fact, Emanuel was confident that the Duke of Crockford would protect him.\nIn such cases, evidence could be suppressed, allowing one to control the narrative.\n…He’s just a boy, trying to rattle me!\nStill, requesting that he poison the Duke of Crockford was a reckless move. It was only right that he report this matter to the Duke of Crockford. However, by keeping it to himself, he could gain favor with Felix.\nThe Duke of Crockford and Felix. Were he to choose a side, the duke with actual power would be the obvious choice. However, the duke was elderly, and considering the future, it wouldn’t hurt to be indebted to Felix.\nAs Emanuel pondered these cunning thoughts, Felix let out a sigh.\n“…I see. You believe you can find a way to deceive your way out of this.”\nWith that, Felix reached for the bell on the table and rang it. At once, a servant with unusual, bluish-white hair placed a dish with a cloche over it before Emanuel.\nIt seemed that the meal had finally arrived, but curiously, the dish was placed before Emanuel alone.\nAn ominous premonition washed over Emanuel, and he looked up at Felix’s expression. As before, the prince wore an inscrutable smile.\n“Please, lift the lid. Oh, don’t worry, it’s nothing dangerous.”\n“…”\nEmanuel gripped the defensive magic tool he always kept on hand and cautiously lifted the lid.\n“…This is…”\nWhat lay on the white plate was an object familiar to any magician—a mana measurement device.\nAs Emanuel froze in shock, Felix steepled his fingers and spoke.\n“It’s nothing more than an ordinary mana measurement device… And it hasn’t been tampered with, I assure you.”\n“…!?”\nIt is generally said that mana grows until one reaches the age of twenty and gradually diminishes thereafter.\nThe minimum mana required to be a member of the Seven Sages is 150. Those who fall below this threshold are no longer eligible.\nThe last time Emanuel had his mana measured, he had scored slightly below 160… But that was then.\n“Please, if you have nothing to hide, simply touch the device. Lord Darwin?”\n“…Y-Yes, indeed…”\nEmanuel’s hand trembled as he touched the measurement device. The device’s dial slowly rose.\n—Attribute: Earth. Maximum Magic Power: 138—\nThat was Emanuel Darwin’s current mana.\n“H-Hahaha… It appears that this device may be malfunctioning!”\n“If that’s your belief, perhaps we could remeasure your mana in a more official setting? …Using a device provided by a neutral third party.”\nFelix had seen through him. He had discovered that Emanuel had been using a modified measurement device to falsely inflate his mana readings.\nHe could get away with selling magic tools made by his apprentices under his own name, but there was no way to fake his mana.\nOnce it was made public, Emanuel would be stripped of his position among the Seven Sages.\nFelix flaunted the vial of poison, shaking it gently. He then placed it before the rigid Emanuel.\n“As one of the Seven Sages, Emanuel Darwin, the ‘Jeweled Magician’… I would very much like to maintain a close relationship with you. In the years to come.”\n“In the years to come” likely referred to the time after Felix had ascended to the throne.\nAt this moment, Emanuel was being tested by the future king.\n—I will not tolerate a turncoat. Choose between me and the Duke of Crockford… or so he implied.\n\"You will show me your loyalty, won't you?\"\nEmanuel’s hand shook as he picked up the vial.\nIf he wished to remain one of the Seven Sages… he had no choice but to assassinate the Duke of Crockford and submit to the young prince.",

      "content": "After finishing his meal with Emanuel, Felix gazed out the window of the carriage taking him back to Serendipia Academy.\nSo far, everything was going perfectly.\nEmanuel Darwin, the Jeweled Magician, had been won over to his side. All that remained was to poison Duke Crockford, and Felix would take the throne as soon as he graduated.\nDuke Crockford was Felix's greatest patron, but he had already secured the support of Baron Grimton, Count Moran, Count Ashent, and Marquis Baldia through his connections in the entertainment district. Even if Duke Crockford were to die suddenly, they would support Felix.\nJust a little longer…\nFor him, the throne was not the finish line but the starting point. The day he died, leaving behind a legacy as a wise king would be his true destination.\nUntil then, he could not afford to rest… no matter the cost.\nFelix took his pocket watch out of his pocket to check the time. It was just past noon. He would probably arrive at the academy around dusk.\nHe had already submitted a request to leave the academy, so he could return to his dormitory, but he had some documents he wanted to organize in the student council room.\nFelix instructed the coachman to take him to the school building instead of his dorm and then leaned back and closed his eyes.\nHe still had plenty of time before they reached the academy. He might as well take a nap.\nAt some point, it started to rain outside.\nThe sound of rain, the sound of the wheels, and the slight swaying of the carriage lulled the half-asleep Felix into a familiar dream.\nWhat appeared behind his closed eyelids was a scene from the first time he had ever ridden in a carriage. Of course, the first carriage he had ridden in was not nearly as elegant as this one.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nIsaac Walker was the son of a doctor in a small town in the eastern part of the Ridill Kingdom.\nHis father was a gentle and kind man, beloved by the townspeople. His mother was beautiful and known for her cooking. He had a younger brother, Colin, who was not yet a year old. Isaac, who had just turned six, and his three family members made up a perfectly ordinary, happy family.\nEven now, Isaac could clearly remember the day that ordinary happiness was shattered.\nIt was the day of the annual festival.\nHe had gone to the festival with his father, mother, and little brother, and he was delighted when they bought him a skewer of venison. As he gobbled up the skewer, getting his hands and mouth all greasy, his father would smile wryly and wipe his mouth with a handkerchief.\n\"Isaac, it's better to hold the skewer horizontally, not vertically.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nIsaac held the skewer horizontally, as his father had told him, and looked up at his little brother in his mother's arms.\n\"The skewer is really good. Do you want some, Colin?\"\n\"*chuckles*, it's still too early for Colin to have a skewer.\"\nIsaac was a little disappointed that he couldn't act like a big brother to his little brother, but he promised himself that he would share his skewers with him once he got a little bigger.\nJust then, the sound of a bell rang out in the distance. The sound of the bell, which had nothing to do with the festival, was a signal of an emergency.\nClang, clang, rang out the violent sound, accompanied by someone's screams.\n\"A dragon! A swarm of dragons is attacking the town!!\"\nThe town, which had been filled with laughter until just a moment ago, was suddenly filled with screams and chaos as people ran for their lives.\n\"Come here!\"\nHis father grabbed Isaac's hand, and his mother held baby Colin tightly as they ran.\nThe skewer fell out of Isaac's hand, and someone stepped on it, crushing it instantly.\nThe town was attacked by a swarm of earth dragons. They were flightless, but their scales were tough, and they were fast. To make matters worse, they were incredibly ferocious when they were in a pack. The town's resident guards were no match for them.\nThe town, which had no significant military force, was quickly overrun, and many people were killed.\nFrom that day on, Isaac and his family lived in a shelter on the outskirts of town, but since his father was a doctor, he went to the front lines to treat the wounded.\n\"Dad, will you be okay? There are still dragons out there, right?\"\nIsaac's father told him, in a gentle voice, that most of the dragons had moved outside of the town.\nEven so, there were still a few dragons that had gotten separated from the pack and remained in the town. What's more, the dragon knights from the royal capital had not yet arrived.\n\"Dad, don't go. It's dangerous.\"\n\"Even if it's dangerous, as a doctor, I must go there. If there are people who are injured, I have to go.\"\nHis father patted his son's head with his large hand and said with a gentle smile, \"Isaac, will you protect your mother and Colin while I'm gone?\"\nIsaac fought back tears and nodded firmly.\n\"Yes, I will. I can do it. Because I'm a big brother.\"\n\"Good boy.\"\nHis father laughed heartily and left the shelter, the hem of his white coat billowing behind him.\nThe next day, his father was crushed to death under a collapsed building.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nIsaac's mother was devastated by his father's death, but she quickly packed their belongings and prepared to leave town for the sake of her sons.\nPeople were swarming the stagecoaches, all pushing and shoving to get on first. Isaac and his mother were only able to board a coach after waiting in line for two days.\nThe coach they finally boarded was a cramped wagon with no seats, and people were packed in like sardines. The middle-aged man sitting next to Isaac kept bumping his elbow into Isaac's head as he moved his arm even slightly, causing him pain.\nAs Isaac sat there, he fought back tears as he thought about his father.\nHe really wanted to burst into tears. But he was a big brother. He had to protect his mother and brother, so he couldn't cry here.\nBut perhaps because he had absorbed the anxiety of those around him, or perhaps because he was hungry, baby Colin, who was in his mother's arms, began to cry.\n\"Oh, Colin, what's wrong? Are you hungry? I'm so sorry, just be patient a little longer.\"\nHis mother tried her best to comfort Colin, but his thin, sobbing voice gradually grew louder. At this rate, it was only a matter of time before he started to cry uncontrollably.\nIsaac took out a handkerchief from his pocket, twisted it up into a ball, and pulled hard on the end.\n\"Look, Colin. It's a bunny.\"\nHe moved the makeshift bunny puppet around near Colin, and Colin's attention shifted to it.\nColin reached out his tiny hand to the bunny puppet and giggled.\nAfter entertaining his brother for a while, Isaac kissed Colin's cheek with the bunny puppet.\n\"What should I make next? A flower? Or a cat?\"\nColin moved his drooling mouth and repeated, \"Hooose.\"\n\"You want a horse? Hmm, that's a bit difficult…just wait a moment.\"\nAs Isaac tried to make a horse out of the handkerchief, the horses suddenly let out a loud neigh, and the carriage shook violently.\nSomeone on the edge of the tilting carriage screamed and cursed as they were crushed, but a ferocious roar drowned out their cries.\nEveryone there knew what that roar meant.\n\"……A dragonnnnnn!!!!\"\nThe moment someone screamed, the carriage shook violently and overturned. A dragon's tail had swept the carriage sideways.\nThe people inside the carriage tumbled over each other and screamed. Some of them were crushed and died instantly, their necks twisted at strange angles or blood pouring from their heads…including Isaac's mother.\n\"Mom, Mom!!\"\nHis mother, who had embraced and shielded Isaac and Colin, was bleeding from her head. Her ankle was also swollen and turning black.\nEven so, his mother did not utter a single word of complaint and pushed Colin towards Isaac.\n\"Take Colin and… run away.\"\n\"Mom, you too…\"\n\"I can't, my leg…doesn't move…hurry…\"\nIsaac hugged Colin and felt lost. Isaac was a smart and sensible child, but he was still only six years old, at an age when he still wanted to be spoiled.\nFor a young boy who had just lost his father, the option of abandoning his mother and running away was too cruel.\n\"No, no, no, no…\"\nAs Isaac sobbed in his arms, Colin began to cry loudly.\n──That's when a large hole appeared in the carriage.\nA dragon had thrust its sharp claws into the carriage.\nIsaac watched as the tip of the giant claw was thrust into his mother's body without hesitation.\nIn that instant, he moved his legs before he could think.\nTurning his back on his mother's corpse, he hugged his little brother and jumped out of the overturned carriage.\nThe scene outside the carriage was a nightmare. Three earth dragons surrounded the carriage. Blood splattered everywhere as the creatures, covered in brown scales, swung their claws haphazardly.\nPeople were being crushed underfoot by their legs, which were thicker than logs.\n\"Uwa, uwa, uwa, ow, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!\"\nIsaac tried to escape through the gap between the dragons. But the dragons mercilessly swung their claws at the young boy.\nIsaac narrowly dodged them, but the tip of a dragon's claw gouged the right half of his face.\n\"Uwaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!!\"\nHe was in excruciating pain, and he couldn't open his eyes, blood dripping down and staining his little brother's face.\n\"Ahhhh, wahhhh, uwaaaaaaaaaahhhh!\"\nAs Isaac screamed and hugged his brother, a dragon's tail struck him hard in the back.\nAnd with that, Isaac lost consciousness.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nRaindrops fell on Isaac's bloodstained skin as he lay there. The rain washed away the stench of death and blood that hung in the air.\n\"…Colin… Colin……\"\nIsaac desperately held on to his fading consciousness and held his little brother to his chest.\nHe stretched out his short arms to keep Colin from getting wet, even just a little bit.\n\"…I'll protect you… I'm your big brother…\"\nHe heard the sound of hooves in the distance. And not just one. It must be the dragon knights. The dragon knights had come to their rescue.\nHe heard the voices of adults above him.\n\"What a horrible sight…\"\n\"I heard it was the work of earth dragons… but earth dragons aren't supposed to live in this area?\"\n\"They're probably dragons from the empire that crossed the border.\"\n\"This is hopeless… there are no survivors… wait, there's a voice coming from over there!\"\nThe knights heard Isaac's faint voice and quickly helped him up.\nNow he would be saved. He had managed to protect his little brother, Isaac thought hazily.\n\"…The older brother is barely alive…\"\n\"But, the younger brother is…\"\nThat's when Isaac finally realized.\nHis little brother's body in his arms was cold. His cries had stopped a long time ago.\nThere was no way that his young brother could have survived for days, left out in the open.",

      "content": "In general, people believe that orphans receive no proper education and have limited job opportunities.\nIsaac, who was taken in by the Dragon Knight Order and brought to an orphanage, believed that the orphanage he would live in would also be such an environment.\nHowever, the orphanage Isaac was brought to was much cleaner than he had imagined, and he was given a proper education within the facility.\n\"You have all been given a great fortune.\"\nThese were the words the head of the orphanage would always say before prayers at breakfast.\nFortunate was an apt word to use. The children gathered at this orphanage were mostly aesthetically pleasing and graceful. Isaac too, although he had a scar on his right eye, had a well-presented face. If he covered his right eye with his bangs, he was somewhat presentable. Above all, his rich golden hair was a trait favored by nobles.\nUltimately, these children were being raised with the premise of being brought up by nobles. Therefore, the adults at the orphanage desperately made the children study. As they received a considerable amount of money for \"shipping out\" a suitable child to nobles.\nThe studying at the orphanage was brutal. Children who performed poorly often had their meals withheld or were whipped on their hands.\nThe children did not become united through these harsh conditions. On the contrary, the children who believed they were \"chosen\" were highly competitive, and it was not uncommon for them to slander their rivals to get rid of them.\nIsaac, who was particularly outstanding in his studies, was targeted by older children.\nThey would openly persecute him, saying a broken fool like him would never be chosen by a noble.\nIsaac, who had no interest in being adopted by a noble, ignored the rumors around him and continued to study diligently.\nHe did not particularly want to enter a good school or be adopted by a noble.\nHowever, since the day he lost his family, he could not think of anything else to do.\nSo, he simply crammed his empty mind with knowledge. If he had not done so, his mind would have been destroyed.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nOne day, Isaac was called to the headmaster's office. However, the headmaster was not in his office, and there was only one elderly man there, who looked like a nobleman and was sitting on a sofa.\nThe man glanced at Isaac and spoke.\n\"Come in.\"\nHe had the voice of a person accustomed to giving orders, Isaac thought. Nobles often spoke this way, but this man seemed to be in a different class altogether.\n\"Show me your face.\"\nIsaac felt it was troublesome to resist, so he raised his bangs, which had been covering his right eye.\nThis guest seemed to be interested in him. Perhaps he would say he wanted to adopt the child with the best grades at the orphanage.\n…Anyhow, he must hesitate upon seeing this wound.\nHowever, contrary to Isaac's expectations, the man did not even frown when he saw the ugly scar.\n\"A wound of this level can easily be changed at the time of your transformation.\"\n\"???\"\n\"If your hair color and bone structure are similar, it is enough. Your grades are also satisfactory.\"\nWhat in the world was this man saying? However, he felt a strange sense of foreboding.\nThe children at this orphanage believed that they would be happy if they were adopted by a noble. However, Isaac was aware that only a few would truly find happiness that way.\nFrankly speaking, only a few genuinely wanted a child. Others either made a toy out of them to vent their frustrations or used them for nighttime entertainment. He had once heard a story about a wife who had lost her child and dressed the child like a doll to replace them.\nHowever, Isaac felt the man in front of him was different. If he had to say, the latter option was the closest.\nThis man seemed to have a clear purpose for wanting a child.\nWhen the man rang the bell, the headmaster rushed in.\n\"I shall take this child.\"\nThe headmaster beamed and bowed his head to the man as he placed a bag filled with gold coins on the table.\n\"Thank you very much, Your Excellency. Now, you must express your gratitude. Isaac.\"\n\" …Excellency?\"\nIsaac gave the man, who had not yet given his name, a suspicious look. The man answered calmly.\n\"Darius Nightray, the Duke of Crockford.\"\nIsaac was flabbergasted at the name of a great noble known by every child in this country.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nIsaac, who had been decided to be taken in by the Duke of Crockford, was dressed in a fine outfit and made to ride in the duke's carriage. As if he did not want other children to know Isaac was taken in by the Duke of Crockford.\nHe had no one to say goodbye to in the first place, but he was angry at the adults who took matters into their own hands and proceeded without Isaac's will.\nThe carriage carried only the duke and Isaac. For a nobleman of his stature, there were few escorts, indicating that he wanted to keep Isaac's presence a secret.\nHe wondered what he would be made to do and why he was being taken in. While thinking deeply and observing the duke cautiously, the duke spoke abruptly.\n\"You seem to comprehend that you have been given some kind of role.\"\nHe seemed to be rather impressed that Isaac was not readily overjoyed at being adopted.\n\" …What do you want me to do?\"\n\"To be the stand-in for my grandson.\"\n\" …Grandson?\"\nWhen it came to the Duke of Crockford's grandson, the first person to come to mind was Felix Ark Ridill, the second prince born to the duke's daughter, Princess Irene.\nThe second prince was five years old this year, relatively close to Isaac's age, who had just turned seven. Moreover, he had heard that the second prince was sickly and currently recuperating at the Duke of Crockford's mansion, his grandfather.\n\" …Do you want me to be the body double for His Highness Felix … with this face?\"\nIsaac lifted his hair, which was hiding his right eye. It was said that the vertical scar that ran across his right eye would never disappear. The wound was discolored and raised. It was not something that could be easily concealed with makeup.\nHowever, the Duke of Crockford's demeanor seemed to suggest that there would be no problem.\n\"There is a way to reconstruct your face.\"\n\" …Reconstruct my face?\"\nIsaac was a doctor's son. That was why he knew that the scar would not disappear easily. He also knew how difficult it was to manipulate a human face. It was impossible to make someone look exactly like someone else with current technology.\nHowever, the Duke of Crockford's voice was filled with an eerie sense of confidence.\n\"Eventually, you will have to give up both your face and your name. Until then, you should become accustomed to taking over as that *thing*, as Felix's attendant.\"\nAs if it were a matter of course, this man was telling Isaac to discard his face and name.\nHowever, more than that, Isaac felt the disgust when the man referred to his grandson as \"that *thing*.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nWhen Isaac arrived at the duke's mansion, the first person the duke introduced him to was, as expected, the second prince, Felix.\nThe young prince, who had just turned five years old, was as adorable as a doll, but he looked up at the Duke of Crockford with a timid and frightened expression on his face.\n\"W, welcome back, Grandfather …\"\nHis grandson, who was fidgeting and intertwining his fingers as he spoke, was met with a cold gaze from the Duke of Crockford.\nThat was a gaze given to someone who had been assessed and deemed not worthy of expectation. Isaac had seen that gaze countless times during the year he had spent at the orphanage.\nHe felt a chill when he realized that for the Duke of Crockford, even his grandson, the second prince of the country, was not a person of value.\n\"From today on, this is Isaac, who will be your attendant.\"\nAs he spoke, the duke practically brushed past Felix as if he had outlived his use.\n\"A, ah, Grandfather, um …\"\nFelix tried to follow his grandfather in a panic. But the duke turned his cold gaze on Felix.\n\"It is your duty as the master to teach your new attendant the rules of the mansion. Can't you even understand that much?\"\n\"I, I'm sorry … um, I mean, excuse my m, manners.\"\nFor the first time, the duke's expression broke at the young prince's clumsy and lisped apology.\nHowever, he did not smile at his grandson but frowned unpleasantly.\n\"How deplorable. Is that the child of Irene?\"\nFelix stood still, his shoulders trembling as if he had been hit.\nMeanwhile, the Duke of Crockford walked away at a brisk pace.\nFelix, who was still only five years old, had tears welling up in his beautiful aqua eyes, but he desperately tried to hold back his sobs.\nIsaac's mind overlapped the image of the young boy with his younger brother, Colin, who had died young. Colin had been even younger, but this prince was not much different in terms of helplessness.\nIsaac took out a handkerchief from his pocket and rolled it into the shape of a rabbit, which he moved in front of Felix.\n\" …Ah, a rabbit.\"\nIsaac raised the corner of his mouth slightly and gave Felix a kiss on his cheek with the handkerchief rabbit. As if wiping away the tears that had welled up.\n\"Have your tears stopped?\"\n\"A … ah …\"\nFelix seemed ashamed that he was about to cry, and he blushed and fidgeted.\nIsaac wiped away the tears from his other eye with the handkerchief rabbit.\n\"Is there anything else you would like me to make? I can quickly make a cat or a flower.\"\n\" …Can I make it, too?\"\nWould Colin have been like this if he had been alive?\nAh, that's right. I want to … teach Colin about all sorts of things.\nFor the first time since his family had been killed, Isaac found something he wanted to do.\n──I want to make this young prince laugh.\nIsaac gave Felix a genuine smile, unlike the fake ones he had given so far. His aqua eyes sparkled and looked up at him.",

      "content": "Normally servants shared a dormitory, but Isaac, who was chosen to be the attendant for Felix, had been given his own private room relatively close to Felix's.\nThis was a rare preferential treatment, probably intended to prepare for the time when Isaac would become Felix's double.\nIsaac spent his busy days working as Felix's attendant during the day, learning self-defense and horseback riding in between, and completing a huge amount of homework given to him by the duke at night after returning to his own room.\nAs an attendant for Felix, he had to imitate Felix's behavior and gestures.\nSelf-defense, horseback riding, and the large amount of homework were all for when he would eventually serve as a double.\nContinuing such a life, Isaac came to understand why the Duke of Crockford was in such a hurry to have a double ready.\nFelix was too weak. He probably had weak lungs and watery blood. He would soon faint even if he ran around a little, and his muscle strength was considerably weaker than a child of his age. He would develop a fever even with a slight change in the weather.\nThe adults around him seemed to have realized that the second prince would not live long.\nThe first summer since Isaac became Felix's attendant had passed, and as the mornings and evenings grew colder, Felix developed a high fever and took to his bed.\nHe barely ate, his cheeks were flushed red, and his breathing was strained and painful.\nDespite this, the duke, who lived in the same mansion, made no attempt to care for his grandson. It seemed he was thinking that the boy could die if he did.\nIsaac personally stayed at the bedside of a delirious Felix and nursed him. He would tenderly wipe away his sweat and offer him water from the water jug. And every time Isaac did something for him, Felix would look at him with watery eyes and say painfully,\n\"…I'm sorry I'm causing you trouble.\"\n\"You're not being a bother.\"\nEven though Isaac spoke to him gently, Felix's sorrowful expression did not brighten.\nAlthough he was royalty and deserved to be taken care of, Felix always apologized to everyone for everything.\nI'm sorry I don't understand my studies.\nI'm sorry I can't ride a horse properly.\nI'm sorry I'm not good at greeting people.\nI'm sorry I can't meet everyone's expectations.\nIt was easy to see how the Duke of Crockford had treated Felix up until now.\nHis eyes always said that anyone who didn't meet expectations was not needed.\nThat was why the duke was training Isaac to be a double so that Isaac would do everything that the useless prince was supposed to do.\n\"…Isaac.\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Why am I … always so bad at things? … I want to meet my grandfather's expectations …\"\nThere was a sniffling sound. It seemed that Felix was not only physically but also mentally weak.\n\"I'll probably die before I become an adult… and everyone will forget about me. A weak and shameful second prince… like I never existed…\"\nIt would be no use trying to comfort him by saying, \"That's not true.\" Felix's tears would not stop. Felix closed his swollen eyelids, which were red from crying, and murmured in a hoarse voice.\n\"…I wish I could become a star when I die… like the first king, Ralph. If I became a constellation, everyone would remember me.\"\nIt was a story from a book that Felix had been reading recently.\nThe Founder King Ralph had been afraid of being forgotten by people after his death.\nWhen Ralph's wife, Amelia, learned of this, she asked the Spirit King of Darkness to make Ralph a constellation at his funeral.\nIsaac smiled wryly at Felix's idea, which was fitting for a star-loving boy.\n…Even if you don't become a constellation, I won't forget you.\nStill, it wouldn't be enough if only Isaac remembered. Surely.\nIsaac wiped Felix's forehead with a cloth that had been soaked in cold water and brushed his sweaty bangs.\n\"Once Your Highness's fever goes down, I will grant you any request.\"\n\" …Anything?\"\n\"Yes. So, please don't be so disheartened.\"\nWhen Isaac nodded gently, Felix shyly played with the edge of the blanket, saying,\n\"Then … I want a friend.\"\n\"Then, let us ask the duke. I'm sure he can introduce you to suitable children from good families.\"\nWhen Isaac made that suggestion, Felix reached out from under the blanket and timidly grasped the hem of Isaac's jacket.\n\" …I wanna friend with you, Isaac.\"\n\"But I'm your servant?\"\n\" …Only when other people aren't around.\"\nAs he said that, Felix mumbled, his cheeks flushed with embarrassment.\nIsaac stifled a small laugh and said as he wiped Felix's forehead again.\n\"Ark.\"\nIt was Felix's middle name, which he was rarely called by.\nFelix looked up at Isaac with wide, aqua eyes.\nIsaac winked at him, teasing him a little.\n\"If I call you differently, it'll feel more like we're friends, don't you think?\"\nFelix's face suddenly brightened. It was as if all his dejection and whining had been a lie.\n\"Then, then, I'll call you Ike too!\"\n\"Okay. Ark and Ike, they sound kind of similar.\"\n\"Yes! …Yes!\"\nFelix nodded again and again, his eyes sparkling and a huge smile on his face. He looked very happy.\nIf Isaac knew he was going to become Felix's double, he would probably despair. He would realize that the duke did not need him.\nThat was why Isaac had not told Felix that he was going to be a double.\nHe could not possibly say, \"Because you are weak and incompetent, I was bought by the duke.\"\n…But he knew that such a day would come when he would have to tell him the truth.\nIsaac turned a blind eye to the truth and immersed himself in his secret game of friends with Felix.\nWhen there was no adult watching, Felix would pull at the hem of Isaac's clothes and call out \"Ike\" with a smile that befitted his age.\nWhen Felix called him \"Ike,\" it was the beginning of their time as secret friends.\n\"What is it, Ark?\"\n\"Um, hey, there's a meteor shower tonight, apparently. Let's watch it together, through my window, if it's okay?\"\nIsaac was a little troubled by the childish request. It was easy to sneak out of his room in the middle of the night, but he had a lot of homework from the duke to do.\nStill, he wanted to fulfill his cute Ark's request, so Isaac smiled.\n\"Okay. I'll come to your room quietly when it's night. But will you be able to stay awake until then, Ark?\"\n\"I'll stay awake … If I start to fall asleep, will you wake me up, Ike?\"\n\"I'll prepare some biscuits and mint tea. Will that keep you awake?\"\n\"Yes!\"\nThat night, the two of them sat at the window, drinking tea, nibbling on biscuits, and gazing at the night sky.\nFelix loved stars. Although he couldn't exactly be called quick-witted, he seemed to be good at remembering what he liked.\nFelix pointed to each of the shining stars and told him the names and origins of the constellations.\nIn the end, Felix dozed off in the middle of it all, and Isaac ended up carrying him to bed.\nIsaac stroked Felix's hair as he slept, just as he used to do for his little brother.\n\"…Goodnight, Ark.\"\nFor Isaac, Felix was a master, a friend, and a little brother-like existence.\nThe little prince gently filled the empty heart of Isaac, who had lost his family.\nTheir time together was too precious to be called mere make-believe.",

      "content": "About a year after Isaac came to the Crockford Ducal House, a young boy started visiting the mansion. The boy's name was Elliot Howard. He was the eldest son of the Count of Dursvy and was the same age as Felix, six years old.\nPerhaps the Duke of Crockford intended to make Elliot a friend to Felix and use it as a starting point for socializing.\nFelix was fond of Isaac, but he had no other friends. So Isaac secretly hoped this would be a good opportunity for Felix to make a friend.\nHowever, this young Elliot turned out to be quite a brat. At first, he showed a polite attitude towards Felix, but as time went on, his attitude became more and more arrogant.\nIt was clear that Elliot looked down on Felix, who was not good at studying or sports. Yet, in front of adults, he would act amiably and pretend to be close to Felix.\nThat day, while Elliot was practicing horseback riding with Felix, he laughed at and teased Felix, who couldn't ride a horse by himself and was being supported by Isaac.\n\"Your Highness, you still can't ride by yourself?\"\n\"Uhhh…\"\nFelix, who was barely able to stay on the horse with Isaac supporting him from behind, trembled and couldn't argue back.\nHorses are surprisingly high when you ride them. Felix was probably terrified of being thrown off at any moment.\n\"Your Highness, it's okay, I'm with you,\" Isaac said, supporting Felix from behind.\nElliot grinned maliciously. \"Haha, you're more like a princess than a prince!\"\nFelix's face turned red and tears welled up in the corners of his eyes. Isaac glared at Elliot with a cold gaze, but Elliot sneered back at Isaac arrogantly.\n\"What's with you, servant? If you have something to say, say it.\"\n\"……\"\nThere were plenty of things Isaac wanted to say. But as a servant, Isaac was not allowed to talk back.\nAbove all, Isaac might have to interact with Elliot in the future as Felix's body doubles. It was undesirable to say or do anything that would remain in Elliot's memory. He should try to be as inconspicuous a servant as possible.\nIsaac averted his eyes from Elliot with a snort and rode the horse while supporting Felix. Felix was already struggling just to hold the reins and was in no condition to communicate with the horse.\nWhen Elliot was out of sight, Isaac slowed the horse down, and Felix mumbled, \"…I'm sorry, Isaac.\"\n\"What are you apologizing for?\"\n\"It must be embarrassing for you to have someone like me as your master…\"\nThere was no one around, but Felix deliberately called him \"Isaac\" instead of \"Ike\".\nHe was ashamed of his own incompetence not as a friend, but as a master. That kind of seriousness was just like him.\n\"I have never been ashamed of you, not even once.\"\nIt was true that Felix was not good at studying or sports. He was also very shy and couldn't talk properly to people he met for the first time.\nStill, Isaac knew that Felix was more hardworking than anyone else. And that he had a kinder heart than anyone else.\n\"You are my pride and joy as a master,\" Isaac told him.\nFelix mumbled a small \"thank you\" with a shy smile.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThe next day, an incident occurred while Isaac was receiving self-defense training in the backyard.\n\"Someone! Someone, help me!\"\nThe scream-like voice belonged to Elliot.\nElliot and Felix were supposed to be together right now. Faced with the fact that only Elliot was screaming in such a situation, Isaac ran towards the voice without hesitation.\nHis whole body turned cold and a chill ran down his spine. It was the same fear he had felt when he lost his family to a dragon invasion.\nPlease, please let nothing happen to Felix… As he prayed and rushed over, what Isaac saw was Felix lying limp, bleeding from his side.\nElliot was sobbing beside him.\n\"Your Highness Felix!\"\nIsaac rushed to Felix and checked his injury. A thick, hard wooden branch was stuck deep in Felix's right side. It was hard to believe that it could be stuck in so deep just from falling over.\nIsaac glared at Elliot. \"What did you do to His Highness Felix?\"\n\"N, no… he fell from the tree…\"\n\"…From the tree?\"\nIsaac looked up at the tree right next to where Felix had fallen. Indeed, it was a fine, thick tree, just right for climbing. But he couldn't imagine Felix, who was not good at sports, wanting to climb a tree on his own.\nBetween the branches of the tree, he looked up at, Isaac could see a book peeking out. That alone was enough for the perceptive Isaac to understand the situation.\n\"…You forced him to. If he wanted his book back, he had to climb the tree.\"\nIsaac growled through gritted teeth, and the pressured Elliot turned pale and trembled. He wanted to punch him in the face right now, but getting Felix to a doctor was the priority.\nIsaac took off his own jacket and used it to stop the bleeding from Felix's wound, then instructed the gardener who had rushed over after hearing the commotion to call a doctor.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"The treatment is finished,\" the doctor, who was a resident of this mansion, said as he wiped his hands and spoke to Isaac and the head maid who were watching over Felix at his bedside.\nThe two of them, who had been taking care of Felix since he was brought in, breathed a sigh of relief and put their hands on their chests. Especially the elderly head maid, Marcy, seemed to have completely loosened her tear glands and was wiping her eyes with her apron.\nIsaac finally released the tension in his shoulders, relieved that he hadn't lost someone important to him.\nStill, it pained his heart to see Felix in front of him, breathing painfully.\nIf only I hadn't taken my eyes off him…\nWhen Felix was injured, Isaac was undergoing self-defense training on the Duke's orders. There was no reason for him to be blamed.\nEven so, Isaac couldn't help but blame himself for his carelessness in overlooking leaving Felix alone with the malicious Elliot.\nFortunately, Felix's injury did not reach his internal organs, and a simple suture surgery was enough. Still, the pulled scar would probably remain for the rest of his life. Just like the scar on Isaac's face.\nAs Isaac bit his lip while gazing at Felix's sleeping face, the doctor patted him on the shoulder.\n\"Isaac, can I have a word with you?\"\n\"…?\"\n\"I have something important to tell you.\"\nThe doctor was a bespectacled man with a slight foreign accent. He was probably in his forties. His quirky gray hair was tied back, and he was tall and slender.\nThe doctor was also Felix's attending physician, but Isaac didn't know much about him. In fact, he didn't even know his real name. Some people occasionally called him Arthur, but most people called him Doctor or Professor.\nNone of the mansion's residents, not just Isaac, knew this man's background. Still, this doctor was trusted by the Duke of Crockford, and that alone was enough for the people of the mansion.\nWhen Arthur told him that he had something important to tell him, Isaac was puzzled. If possible, he wanted to stay by Felix's side until he woke up.\nStill, Arthur looked serious, so Isaac stood up and bowed his head to the head maid.\n\"Mrs. Marcy, please take care of His Highness.\"\n\"Yes, I understand.\"\nMarcy, the head maid, had apparently lost a young son to illness a long time ago, and she always took care of Felix. She was one of the few allies Felix had in this mansion full of Duke Clockford's supporters.\nIf it was Marcy, it would be okay to leave Felix to her.\nWith that in mind, Isaac followed Arthur out of the room.\nThe place Arthur headed to was the study of the Duke of Crockford.\nThe Duke was sitting at his desk, working. Even at a time like this, he didn't bother to come and check on Felix. He really hates this man.\nThe Duke looked up from the papers he had been facing and glanced at Arthur and Isaac.\n\"What about\nthat\ncondition?\"\n\"Well, we have a bit of a problem,\" Arthur said.\n\"That\" probably referred to Felix.\nIsaac frowned slightly in displeasure, but Arthur didn't seem to mind and spread his arms a little dramatically.\n\"Your Highness Felix's wound didn't reach his internal organs, but that scar is definitely going to remain… I could use my technique to erase the scar, but the Count of Dursvy's family also knows about this accident. This is inconvenient for the ‘replacement'.\"\nAt the word \"replacement\", Isaac couldn't help but stare at Arthur's face. This doctor knew that Isaac was going to become Felix's body double.\nOn top of that, he was concerned that Felix's scar might cause trouble when they switched places.\nDuke Crockford looked at Isaac standing behind Arthur with his pale blue eyes and said without changing his expression, as if it was the natural thing to do, \"Then give that one the same scar.\"\nGive Isaac the same scar as Felix, he said dismissively, as if it was the obvious thing to do.\nIsaac had been punished by the Duke many times before. When he was late with his assignments because he was too busy taking care of Felix, or as an example to the underperforming Felix, Isaac had been punished several times.\nA little while ago, when he secretly brought in an astronomy book for Felix, he was severely whipped on the back. The marks from that whip still remained vividly on Isaac's back.\nEventually, when Isaac switched places with Felix, the scars from the punishment would be erased along with the scar on his face. It was still hard for Isaac to believe, but apparently, in Arthur's hands, scars could be erased like magic.\nHide all unnecessary scars.\nCarve the necessary scars with a knife, as much as needed.\nThat was how Isaac was being remade into \"Felix\".\nHe felt like he was gradually being deprived of his sense of self and becoming a mere doll.\nStill, Isaac wanted to be by Felix's side. To do that, he had no choice but to obey the Duke.\n\"…I understand.\"\nTo Isaac, who answered with dark eyes, Duke Crockford only said, \"Good,\" and went back to his papers.\nAs if to say he had no further use for him.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nDr. Arthur looked down expressionlessly at Isaac, whose hands and feet were restrained to keep him from struggling and whose mouth was gagged with cloth to keep him from biting his tongue.\nThere was no sympathy or pity in the eyes behind the round glasses. It was the same look one would give to a lab animal.\nAs expected of someone who was complicit in the Duke's insane replacement plan, this doctor was probably not quite right in the head either. Or perhaps Isaac himself, who quietly accepted this treatment, was not quite right in the head either.\nStill, Isaac could no longer let go of the days he spent with Felix.\nFelix had given meaning to Isaac's empty life.\nSo for the sake of living with Felix, he could endure any kind of treatment.\nArthur pressed the knife he had heated with fire into Isaac's belly. The skin broke with a snap and the flesh tore. The searing pain turned his vision white. The agonized voice was absorbed by the cloth in his mouth, and the muffled scream reached no one.\n\"That should do it. Next, I'll suture the scar.\"\nArthur put down the knife and picked up a needle for suturing.\nThe agony was not over yet. Even after the thread was passed through his skin and clean bandages were wrapped around him, a throbbing pain continued to torment Isaac.\nStill, if he thought that this was the pain Felix had also experienced, he could endure it as much as he needed to.\n\"The treatment is finished. You must not show that scar to anyone else. Of course, not even to His Highness Felix.\"\nIsaac, freed from his restraints, stroked his aching side over the bandage as he breathed heavily, his breath hot.\nThis is a necessary scar for me to stay by Ark's side.\nLittle by little, he was being remade.\nLittle by little, \"Isaac\" was being destroyed.\nStill, if there was a future where he could live with Felix, he was sure he could stay sane.\nAh, I have to go to Ark's place soon. I have to take care of him. He must be lonely…\nIsaac headed to Felix's room with unsteady steps.\nFelix was still asleep. The head maid Marcy, who was attending to him, made a startled face when she saw Isaac.\n\"What's the matter, Isaac? You look deathly pale. And you're sweating terribly!\"\n\"…I'll take over the nursing.\"\nMarcy scolded Isaac, saying, \"What are you saying with a face like that!\" But when she realized that Isaac would not budge, she sighed with an exasperated look on her face.\n\"…Just for a little while, all right, Isaac?\"\n\"Thank you, very much.\"\nThanking Marcy, Isaac sat down in the chair beside the bed.\nMarcy gave Isaac a concerned look and quietly left the room.\nAt the sound of the door closing with a thud, Felix's eyelids trembled and slowly lifted.\n\"…Ike?\"\nFelix, who must still be suffering from the pain, called out to Isaac in a hoarse voice.\nIsaac suppressed all his own agony and put on his usual gentle smile.\n\"That must have hurt. You did well to endure it, Ark.\"\nWhen he gently stroked Felix's disheveled hair, Felix smiled with a look of relief.\n\"…Yeah.\"\n\"I'm here. You should go back to sleep.\"\n\"…Okay.\"\nMumbling softly, Felix closed his eyes again. His sleeping face looked a little more peaceful than before.\nLooking at that sleeping face, Isaac vowed to himself.\nEven if Isaac Walker as an individual was distorted.\nEven if he was remade into a doll with a different face than his original one.\nThis time… this time for sure, I'll protect him.",

      "content": "Felix Ark Ridill disliked himself.\nHe had a poor memory, felt sick and collapsed after even slight physical activity, and couldn't speak well in front of others. A weak and incompetent prince. No matter how hard he tried, he could never live up to others' expectations. He could never make his grandfather proud.\nWhile Felix barely remembered his mother's face, everyone agreed that Duchess Irene was a beautiful and intelligent woman.\nShe must have been the pride of Duke Crockford, her father. That's why the grandfather often mentioned Irene's name.\nThey said Irene's health deteriorated after giving birth to Felix, eventually leading to her death.\n──\"If that's the case, she should have given up on childbirth to preserve Lady Irene's life.\"\n──\"To trade her life for such a prince…\"\n──\"Another child could have been born if needed.\"\nWhen Felix overheard the servants in the mansion saying such things, he wished he could disappear.\nIt's because of me that my mother died. I shouldn't have been born.\nThinking that made Felix feel utterly miserable and sad, so he hid under the covers and cried silently.\n\"…Your Highness Felix?\"\nIt was Isaac, his attendant, from the other side of the blanket.\nAlthough Felix tried his best to stifle his voice, it seemed his crying had leaked out.\n\"Are you all right? Does anything hurt?\"\nAh, he had made kind Isaac worry too. He was such a nuisance of a prince, always troubling others.\n──It was his fault that the beloved mother died and he, the incompetent one, was born instead. Just causing trouble with no redeeming value, he shouldn't have been born.\nFrom under the covers, Felix confessed his true feelings in a cracked voice. Isaac stroked Felix's head over the blanket.\n\"…Ark, I would never think that it'd be better if you hadn't been born.\"\nThose words saved Felix so much.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAround his 8th birthday, Felix began frequently running fevers and being bedridden.\nUntil recently, his health had been decent enough to play chess with Elliot and have tea parties and dance practice with Bridget. But for the past month or two, he had been confined to his room.\nThat day, the weather was nice and warm, so Felix felt a bit better than usual. Still, he wasn't well enough to go outside, so he put on a shawl, sat at his desk, and opened his diary.\nHe hadn't written much in it lately since he was stuck in his room all day with nothing to write about.\nSo, playfully, Felix doodled in the corner of the notebook. He drew a prince wearing a crown──his idea of the ideal prince. Next to the drawing, Felix wrote:\n[The Ideal Prince]\n• Intelligent (understands complex political matters)\n• Brave\n• Kind to everyone\n• Skilled at swordsmanship and horseback riding\n• Excellent hunter\n• Able to use many kinds of magic\n• Can greet people confidently (doesn't stutter)\n• Strong at chess (better than Elliot)\n• Compliments women elegantly (doesn't anger Bridget)\n• Skilled dancer (leads well, doesn't step on partner's feet)\n• Can do all sorts of things like Ike\nAs he finished writing, Felix put down his pen. The princely ideal he described was worlds apart from himself.\nTake swordsmanship and horseback riding, for example──his older brother Lionel excelled at those. So Felix had considered focusing on magic instead, but his own mana capacity was just average. Plus, he barely understood magic formulas, even those for beginners.\nFelix's late mother Irene was said to be adept at magic, even contracting with a high-ranking elemental spirit of water──an incredible feat achieved by very few mages in the kingdom.\nIf I could contract a spirit like that, maybe Grandfather would praise me. Maybe everyone would say I'm amazing.\nWith a sigh, Felix took out an aquamarine necklace from the drawer, a keepsake from his mother. This aquamarine was her contract stone, housing the water spirit she was bound to.\nBut no matter how much he studied, Felix could never summon that spirit, as his innate affinity differed from his mother's.\nLetting out another sigh as he returned the necklace, there was a knock before Isaac entered.\nSeeing Felix sitting in the chair, Isaac slightly furrowed his brow with concern.\n\"Are you sure you should be up?\"\n\"Yeah, I'm feeling better today.\"\n\"I see.\"\nIsaac seemed a bit relieved as he set a tray with tea on the table. He then glanced at Felix and blinked.\n\"A diary entry?\"\n\"A, Ah, well…\"\nFlustered, Felix covered the open page with his arm. It's not that he minded Isaac seeing a regular diary entry, but today's was embarrassing.\nAfter all, he had seriously contemplated the ideal, far-removed image of a prince!\n\"Did… you see it?\"\n\"I caught a glimpse of the drawing, it seems… Is it something that would be a problem for me to see?\"\n\"Uuuuugh~~\"\nAlthough Felix mumbled incoherently at first, he eventually relented and removed his arm from the notebook.\n\"…Well, if it's you, Ike, I don't mind.\"\nSince Ike was Felix's close friend, not just an attendant, Felix was willing to show him. Peering into the diary, Ike's eyes widened at the text.\n\"…'Compliments women elegantly'?\"\n\"Yeah, remember how Bridget scolded me the other day? ‘Does His Highness not understand social graces at all?' she said.\"\nThe princely characters in stories always complimented women with sweet, wonderful words.\n‘Your hair is as beautiful as silk,' or ‘You are a single rose in bloom,' and so on.\nAlthough Felix argued this seriously, Isaac didn't seem fully convinced.\n\"I don't think that really fits the criteria for a prince, though…\"\n\"Bridget would surely prefer a charming, well-spoken prince too. She must find it a nuisance to be considered my potential fiancee.\"\nGlancing back at the ideal prince he had written, Felix grew sadder.\nHow incredibly far he was from the beloved, perfect prince.\nSniffling, Felix was surprised when Isaac reached out and took the feather pen. But instead of writing, Isaac simply circled the line \"Kind to everyone\" that Felix had written.\n\"I don't know a kinder prince than you,\" Isaac said with a smile.\nTo Felix, Isaac seemed more princelike than himself.\n* * *\nThat afternoon, Felix crawled out of bed and opened his room's window.\nSticking his head out slightly, he had a good view into the inner courtyard where Isaac happened to be training with swords.\nDoing this prompted Isaac to scold him for being reckless. But not this time, with Isaac, occupied with practice.\nIsaac was not only intelligent but physically capable too. At the moment, he was holding his own against a larger, seasoned instructor. Felix liked secretly watching Isaac train from his window.\n\"…So cool.\"\nThough only two years older than Felix, Isaac was quick-witted, poised, and would subtly help Felix whenever he stumbled over greetings or etiquette.\nBridget probably wishes Isaac were the prince instead of me.\nWith a sigh, Felix's gaze followed Isaac.\nThe training session seemed to be taking a break as Isaac set his sword aside. Without hesitation, he removed his sweat-drenched shirt and doused himself with water from a bucket. His toned back bore the marks of whiplashes.\nSeeing those scars always filled Felix with pain and guilt.\nAverting his eyes from the lash marks, Felix noticed a distinct scar on Isaac's right side, below the ribs.\n\"…Huh?\"\nPuzzled, Felix pulled up his own shirt to find a very similar laceration scar in the same area──from when he had fallen from a tree and a branch pierced his side long ago. Isaac's side wound looked nearly identical in placement, size, and state of healing.\n\"But… why?\"\nIsaac definitely didn't have a scar like that when they first met.\nMoreover, Felix had never heard about Isaac suffering such a major injury.\nCould it be… Grandfather did this?\nWhen the tree incident happened to Felix, maybe Isaac was punished by the grandfather for negligent supervision? Was that scar given to Isaac as penance?\nNo way… There's no way…\nAlthough trembling, Felix eventually bit his lip resolutely and headed for his grandfather's quarters.\nIf Isaac's scar was inflicted unjustly… then as his master, Felix could not stay silent.\nConfronting his grandfather terrified him, but scolding his shaking legs, Felix made his way to see the truth.\n──Unaware that the truth would be far more cruel.\n* * *\nThe door to Duke Crockford's quarters always looked enormously imposing to Felix. The pressure from his grandfather likely made it seem that way.\nFelix had wanted to flee from this door more times than he could count. Still, he mustered his courage and knocked.\n\"It's Felix. I wish to discuss something with you, Grandfather.\"\nAfter a pause, a curt \"Enter\" was heard.\nWith a trembling hand, Felix gripped the doorknob and slowly opened it.\nAs always, the Duke had his back turned to Felix as he worked on documents. He only ever looked at Felix with scornful eyes.\nKnowing this, Felix addressed his grandfather's back directly.\n\"I have a question about Isaac.\"\nNo response. But silence didn't mean he couldn't proceed.\nCarefully avoiding stutters, Felix continued speaking.\n\"Isaac has a large scar on his right side, identical to the one I have from falling out of a tree. Do you know anything about how he got that injury, Grandfather?\"\nThe Duke's writing hand paused. So he did know something.\nTurning slowly, the Duke looked at his grandson with an expressionless face.\n\"Perhaps it is a good time, then.\"\n\"…?\"\nTo Felix's confusion, the Duke stated bluntly:\n\"Isaac was taken in to be raised as your body double. Eventually, his face will be reshaped with body manipulation magic to match yours.\"\n\"…Huh?\"\nThe slow-witted Felix didn't immediately grasp the meaning of those words.\nIsaac was his body double? Reshaping faces?\nAs Felix's bewilderment grew, the Duke regarded him with the usual look of scornful disdain.\nThe look of someone giving up on an obtuse grandchild.\n\"In time, Isaac will stand in for you at official functions. You won't need to do anything anymore.\"\nThose words clearly meant to discard Felix.\nSince the surrogate would play all the roles, the useless prince was no longer needed, his grandfather declared.\nA deep despair like the ground crumbling beneath his feet swept over Felix.\nStill, his tongue managed to move because he trusted Isaac.\n\"…Does Isaac know about this?\"\n\"He has known since he was taken in. That's why he accepted bearing the same scars as you.\"\nWith just those words, the Duke turned back to his desk. His silent back conveyed it all:\nThere was no need for expectations or words regarding Felix.\nHis grandfather had given up on him long ago. Thus, a replacement was prepared.\nIsaac had known from the very start that he would take over as Felix. Even so, he became friends at the childish request to \"be friends\" with Felix.\nFelix learned for the first time that when a person is deeply despairing, their heart freezes to the point where they can't even cry or speak.",

      "content": "Just before the date changed, Isaac, who had been facing his desk, finished his day's assignments and stretched in his chair.\nIt had been nearly three years since Isaac had come to this estate. When he was first given this room, he had struggled with the chair and desk being an improper height, but now that he had grown taller, such inconveniences were gone.\nHe was completing the assigned tasks without issue, and his skills with the sword and horse were praised.\nWhether he became a servant or a body double with his face reshaped, as long as he could be by Felix's side, that was enough.\nThe only thing that worried Isaac was how Felix would react when he learned that Isaac would become his body double… that alone frightened Isaac.\nAs he sighed, thinking of the future that would eventually come, there was a modest knocking sound at the door. Who could it be at this hour?\nWhen Isaac opened the door, Felix was standing there. Despite the late hour, he was not in his nightclothes, but wearing a simple shirt and trousers.\n\"Your Highness? What is it?\"\n\"…Ike.\"\nFelix called out Isaac's name as a friend, not a servant, his face stern. Isaac softened his expression slightly.\n\"What's wrong, Ark?\"\nPrompted by Isaac's gentle tone, Felix clenched the hem of Isaac's shirt and said:\n\"Let's go look at the stars.\"\n\"…Right now?\"\nIsaac tilted his head slightly, and Felix, unusually stern, nodded. \"Right now.\"\n\"Can't we just see them from the window?\"\n\"Let's go to the back garden. I had Marcy clear the area near the back door.\"\nIt was an unusual proposal, not at all like the ever-obedient Felix. Isaac was honestly surprised.\nHowever, Felix seemed desperately, stubbornly insistent. Even if Isaac refused, Felix seemed ready to go to the back garden alone.\n\"All right, I understand.\"\nWhen Isaac nodded, Felix looked relieved and stroked his chest.\nThe two walked quietly down the hallway and out the back door. There were night watchmen at the front gate, but they would not be a problem if they did not approach.\nFelix looked up at the largest tree in the back garden and said, \"Let's use this tree.\"\nPreviously, Felix had been seriously injured after falling from a tree while climbing. When Isaac looked at him with concern, Felix smiled. \"It's okay.\"\n\"Elliot taught me how to do it properly.\"\nSaying so, Felix began climbing the tree clumsily but choosing sturdy branches to support his feet. It seemed Elliott had indeed taught him the proper technique.\nAs Isaac waited below, ready to catch Felix if he fell, Felix waved down to him from above the tree.\n\"You too, Ike.\"\nIf things continued like this, there was little chance of Felix falling. Isaac put his feet on the branches like Felix and slid smoothly up the tree, taking a seat beside him.\nLooking up at the night sky, it was quite cloudy, with more than half of the moon and stars obscured. It did not seem suitable for stargazing at all, yet why had Felix so insistently invited Isaac out?\nAfter gazing upwards, Felix turned his eyes to Isaac and furrowed his brow with a smile.\n\"Sorry for being selfish. Sneaking out of the room to look at the stars… I just wanted to do it once with you, Aik.\"\n\"Next time, let me know sooner. Then I can prepare things you might like, like tea and snacks.\"\nFelix dropped his gaze slightly and murmured a soft \"…Yeah.\" His face looked somewhat sad, and Isaac leaned in with concern.\n\"…Ark?\"\nWhen Isaac called out worriedly, Felix quickly looked up and spoke with forced cheer.\n\"Say, Ike. What do you want to be in the future?\"\n\"…Huh?\"\nSeeing Isaac's confusion, Felix rushed on quickly, even faster than usual.\n\"You're smart, and good with swords and horses, so you could be anything you want. A doctor, or teacher…or even a knight, maybe!\"\n\"I'm your servant. Now and forever.\"\nIf Isaac added that there was nothing else he wanted, for some reason, Felix looked as if he might cry.\nHis slender eyebrows slanted sadly, and a thin film of tears formed in his clear, blue eyes.\n\"…Hey, Ike.\"\n\"What is it, Ark?\"\nWhen Isaac responded soothingly, Felix leaned in desperately, then spoke with an uncharacteristically forceful tone:\n\"I want you to find something you can become obsessed with, for your own sake alone, not for anyone else's. I want you to find many things you truly enjoy and love, just for yourself.\"\nWhy was Felix looking as if he might cry?\nServing Felix was Isaac's true desire from the heart.\nFor Isaac, who had lost his family and felt empty, Felix was everything. He never wanted to lose him again, wanted to protect him. For that, he could do anything.\nSo he could not think of anything else he wanted to do.\n…In fact, I don't need anything else, Ark.\nBecause soon, \"Isaac\" would be remade, and turned into a doll with Felix's face.\nThere would be no need for Isaac's will then. All that would be needed was loyalty to Felix. What else was required?\nNoticing Isaac's muted reaction, Felix gripped his hand tightly and pleaded desperately:\n\"…Promise me, Ike. Please, promise that you'll look for things you truly enjoy, things you can become obsessed with, for your own sake.\"\n\"All right, if you insist on it. I'll give it some thought.\"\n\"…Yeah, it's a promise.\"\nWhy had Felix suddenly said such a thing?\nTrying to discern Felix's intentions from his childlike face, a strong gust of wind blew, rustling their hair. The branches swayed, and leaves rustled noisily. The hand gripping Isaac's had grown quite cold.\n\"The wind is getting stronger. We should head back before it becomes unhealthy to stay out here, Ark.\"\n\"…Yeah.\"\nSurprisingly meekly, Felix nodded.\nThe two climbed down in silence and slipped back inside through the back door.\nWhen they reached Felix's room, Felix took an envelope from his pocket and handed it to Isaac.\n\"Ike, will you read this once you're back in your room?\"\n\"Can't I read it here?\"\n\"No. Absolutely not until you're back in your room.\"\nRemembering when Felix was younger and would write letters to practice his handwriting, giving them to Isaac with a cute \"This is for you. Write me back, okay?\", Isaac smiled faintly.\n\"Got it, I'll read it once I'm back in my room.\"\n\"Yeah…well then, good night, Ike.\"\n\"Good night, Ark.\"\nIsaac watched Felix close his door and then returned to his own room.\nThere, he held up the envelope he had just received to the candlelight.\n\"…Huh?\"\nThe envelope seemed to contain something other than just paper, bulging slightly. Shaking it produced a soft, metallic rattling sound, like chains rustling together.\nIsaac carefully opened the package that had been sealed with wax and took out the contents.\nBefore the letter spilled out, a small object rolled into Isaac's palm from the tilted envelope. It was a necklace featuring a large aquamarine gemstone… the keepsake spirit contract necklace that had belonged to the late Queen Irene.\nWhy had Felix put such an important object in an envelope?\nWith trembling fingers, Isaac took out and unfolded the enclosed letter.\n\"My Dearest Ike,\nThank you for always being so kind to me. Thank you for looking after me so much. No matter how many times I say it, it will never be enough.\nEver since the day you became my servant, and the day you became my friend, every single day has been truly enjoyable and filled with happiness. That's why I became spoiled and too dependent on you.\nI heard from Grandfather. That you were taken in to become my body double. That eventually, they plan to reshape your face to be my stand-in.\nThat for that purpose…they would give your body the same scars as mine.\nIt's all because I'm so weak. Because I couldn't live up to Grandfather's expectations as a proper prince.\n…I can't bear the thought of you being remade because of me.\nSo please, run away from this estate. Escape and become free, and then find what you truly want to do for yourself.\nNot for me, but for your own sake, I want you to live freely and find many things you love and can become obsessed with.\nAfter I give you this letter tonight, I plan to cause a bit of a disturbance. Use that opportunity to escape through the back gate.\nThe enclosed necklace should fetch a decent sum if sold. I don't know how to convert it to money, but I'm sure your clever self can manage it.\nThis is the most I can do right now. I'm sorry this is all I can offer.\nYou, my most devoted servant and dearest friend.\nI wish for your happiness more than anyone else.\nFelix Ark Ridill\"\nAll the blood drained from Isaac's body, and his ears were ringing.\nJust like when he saw his mother impaled by a dragon's claw before his eyes, without thinking, Isaac rushed from the room.\nArk! Ark! Arkk!!\nWhen he opened Felix's room door, the room was empty.\nHowever, not much time had passed since they parted. Felix could not have gone far.\nAs Isaac looked around wondering where Felix could be, he heard a scream-like voice from somewhere distant.\n\"Someone, please! The prince…the prince is on the roof…!\"\nIsaac dashed outside through the back door they had used earlier.\nNow that he thought about it, Felix's suggestions to look at the night sky and use the back door were intended to give Isaac a path to escape.\nIf he went out the back gate from the back door, Isaac would be free.\nHowever, he did not do so. Without hesitation, he ran toward the front of the estate. If Felix was trying to lure everyone's attention away so Isaac could escape, it would be in the opposite direction from the back gate, he reasoned.\nSure enough, there were the night watchmen and several servants gathered at the front of the estate, looking up at the roof.\nOn the roof was a small figure visible. Gently swaying golden hair——unmistakably Felix.\nFrom the top floor balcony up to the roof, a ladder had been propped. Most likely, Felix had used it to climb up. That he had prepared the ladder meant he had planned this in advance.\nA strong gust of wind blew. The clouds parted, revealing the round, faintly glowing moon surrounded by twinkling stars that had been obscured.\nNo, stop, Ark!!\nOn the roof, Felix reached out toward the shining stars…\nAnd fell.\nA dull thud. Screams from the servants.\nThe small body thrown into the garden's flowerbeds had limbs bent at unnatural angles.\nA roar like that of a beast rang out. Not realizing it was his own wail of anguish, he pushed through the servants to Felix's side.\n\"Ah…ahh……Aaa…rk…? Wake up, please wake up…\"\nThe body he touched was still warm.\nBut the vacant, open blue eyes reflected only the stars of the night sky, and would never blink again.",

      "content": "Felix lay on the bed as if merely asleep. However, Felix would never open his eyes again or smile at Isaac.\nIn the room were only Dr. Arthur examining Felix's remains, Duke Crockford watching over, and Isaac. The room was far too quiet, with only the faint sound of Dr. Arthur's rustling clothes audible. Eventually, after covering Felix's body with a clean cloth, Dr. Arthur turned to the Duke.\n\"I have confirmed the passing of Prince Felix Ark Ridill.\"\nEven upon being informed of his grandson's death, the Duke remained unshaken. His cold, expressionless gaze at Felix's remains showed no hint of sorrow, pity, or sympathy.\n\"Inform the household that Felix has been spared. However, we cannot let the scandal of the Second Prince falling from the roof spread outside. Issue a gag order, and tell outsiders that Felix fell gravely ill.\"\n\"Yes, understood.\"\nEven at a time like this, the Duke only cared about public appearance. Quietly angered by this, Isaac heard the Duke mutter in a low, resentful voice:\n\"Foolish to the very end… choosing death himself…\"\nThose words froze Isaac's insides.\nAfter learning that Isaac would become his body double, how despondent must Felix have felt? How much must he have cursed his own powerlessness? Being abandoned by the Duke as unnecessary, how painful must it have been for him?\nBearing such despair, Felix tried to let Isaac escape——by leaping from the roof, trading his own life.\nIt was because of Isaac's existence that Felix realized he was no longer needed and fell into despair. And while enveloped in deep despair, he still chose death to let Isaac go free.\nIt's my fault.\nDespite wanting so badly to protect him, it was none other than Isaac's existence that drove Felix to death. If Isaac hadn't existed, Felix surely would have lived.\nIt's my fault that Ark died.\nThat reality, that despair, pierced Isaac's heart. And from the hole it made in his chest, the kind memories he'd built up with Felix seemed to drain away like sand. Gazing vacantly at Felix, Isaac was told by the Duke:\n\"The plan remains unchanged. From today, you are Felix Ark Ridill.\"\nAh, to avoid this, the ever-kind prince threw away his own life, wishing for Isaac's freedom. And yet Isaac is here, wasting Felix's dying wish.\n…Run away? Run and be free, and then what?\nIf Isaac disappeared from here, the Duke would have no choice but to publicly announce Felix's death. And so, Felix's death would be accepted by the people… and eventually, forgotten.\nA young Felix's voice echoed in the depths of Isaac's ears:\n——\"I'll probably die before becoming an adult… and everyone will forget the weak, unsightly Second Prince. They'll forget me like I never existed in the first place…\"\nJust I alone, am remembering him won't be enough.\n——\"…If I died, I wish I could become a star… like the first king Ralph. If I became a constellation, everyone would remember me.\"\nThen I'll become Felix. And engrave this name in history, so no one forgets it.\nA dark glimmer shone in the depths of Isaac's eyes. It was a flame of madness and obsession, far too dark for a ten-year-old boy to harbor. The puppet who lost his precious master slowly opened his sealed lips.\n\"…Could you perform the procedure?\"\nAt Isaac's words, Dr. Arthur nodded. \"Yes, of course.\"\nThus, Isaac Walker abandoned his own face. To etch Felix Ark Ridill's name in history. So that everyone would remember the kind, young prince who died, just like the heroic Ralph.\n…Just for that purpose alone.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThe procedure performed by Dr. Arthur was completed sooner than expected——roughly an hour at most.\n\"You can remove the bandages now.\"\nFollowing his words, Isaac peeled off the bandages covering his face, watched closely by Dr. Arthur and the Duke.\nAs the bandages came off, the cool night air brushed against his face. But that alone wasn't enough to tell if the body alteration magic succeeded.\nConfused, Isaac received a hand mirror from Dr. Arthur. Silently gazing into the mirror, Isaac nearly blurted out \"Ark.\" Staring back at him was undoubtedly Felix.\n\"Since your bone structures were already quite similar, it didn't require much effort. Removing the scars on your back was far more troublesome.\"\nWhen Isaac slid his hand under his shirt to feel his back, just as the doctor said, the scars were completely gone.\nHis fingers felt no rough, bumpy scarring——they glided smoothly over the skin. The scar above his right eye had vanished too. No matter how closely he looked, it seemed inconceivable that a scar had ever been there. The only scar left on the current Isaac was the one mimicking Felix's wound on his side.\n\"However, the difference in physique was unavoidable, so it would be best to avoid meeting outsiders for about a year.\"\n\"You'll be confined, recuperating from a grave illness. We'll hire new attendants.\"\nFor the next year, Felix Ark Ridill would be bedridden with a severe illness. A year should be enough for any physique differences to be explained away as part of his growth spurt.\nAs Isaac tried to stand, he felt a slight dizziness and nausea. At first, he thought it was a visceral revulsion at having his face reconstructed, but it seemed that wasn't the case.\n\"It's the side effects of the body alteration magic——mana poisoning. Normally you should find it difficult even to stand… but it appears you have an abundant supply of mana.\"\nBody alteration magic directly channels mana into the body to alter it physically. Mana becomes toxic to humans beyond a certain quantity. This is precisely why such magic is forbidden.\n…And by using this forbidden magic to reconstruct his face, Isaac was now impersonating the Second Prince——a crime punishable by execution if exposed.\n…Does it matter?\nHe would perfectly act the part of Felix, deceiving everyone. To etch this name in history, he could sacrifice anything. As Isaac harbored that dark resolve, the Duke quietly drove a nail home:\n\"If you are to take Felix's name, you must not use magic. Your differing elemental affinity could give you away.\"\n\"A pity, considering your talent.\"\n\"If you wish to demonstrate ability, do so through means other than magic.\"\nWhat the Duke demanded of \"Felix\" was flawless princely conduct. Very well, he would start with diplomacy and mastering high society.\nThe First Prince was rumored to be inept at foreign relations. Then Isaac's best path to the throne would be to first win over the domestic nobles through diplomacy, steadily achieving results on that front.\nAs Isaac pondered means to that end, the Duke gazed out the window and muttered, \"Now then.\"\n\"Shall we proceed with the final touch?\"\n\"…The final touch?\"\n\"You know very well.\"\nSpeaking thus, the Duke turned his gaze to Felix's body and laid upon another bed.\n\"We will kill Isaac Walker.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAt the far end of the ducal manor's gardens was a small shed used for storage by the gardeners. Isaac and Dr. Arthur carried Felix's remains into the shed, then sprinkled oil around inside.\nTonight, they would burn this shed, making it appear that Isaac perished in the fire. That was the final step of the body double scheme.\nWho could have imagined this dingy, mold-reeking shack becoming Felix's coffin?\nA member of the royalty should be placed in a beautiful casket, surrounded by many flowers and prayers, then interred in the royal family's burial grounds.\nNo, no, it's not Ark dying here. It's Isaac Walker.\nNo matter how many times he told himself that, seeing Felix's remains filled him with guilt that nearly suffocated him. He was about to commit an atrocity beyond comprehension. No matter how often he reasoned that this was necessary, his hands wouldn't stop trembling.\nHe moved some flammable materials near the oil puddle. All that remained was to set it alight. As Isaac's shaking hand drew out a match, the Duke, who had silently observed until now, muttered softly:\n\"This will be the final touch.\"\n\"Huh?\" the barely audible sound escaped Dr. Arthur's mouth along with a spurt of blood.\nClattering, his glasses fell to the floor, followed by the doctor himself collapsing forward, a knife deeply embedded in his slender back. Without hesitation after stabbing the doctor's back, the Duke stated flatly:\n\"Now the only ones who know the truth are you and I.\"\nSeeing Dr. Arthur killed to silence him, the single thought that crossed Isaac's mind was:\nAh, I figured as much.\nIf Isaac ever made a mistake and became an unnecessary existence to the Duke, the Duke would likely dispose of him the same way. This was a demonstration of that. But Isaac's heart had become too numb to feel fear of the Duke's cruelty.\n…Just one more sin added to the pile.\nWith that cold murmur in his heart, Isaac struck the match. Letting the flickering orange flame at the matchstick's tip drip onto the oil's edge caused the fire to swell up rapidly. The flames licked across the floor, engulfing the two corpses.\n\"Let's go.\"\n\"…Yes.\"\nBurning Felix's face into his memory, Isaac left the shed. Soon, the raging inferno consumed the shed… Felix Ark Ridill's resting place.\nArk! Ark!\nOh, my dearest friend, is burning away.\nI'm a sinner who stole his face and name, cremating him without prayers or funerary flowers in a blazing coffin, burning him down to the bones.\nIf we meet again in the depths of the underworld, please, do not forgive me.",

      "content": "After taking over as Felix Ark Ridill, Isaac spent a year intensively studying politics.\nOstensibly, Felix was bedridden due to illness, so he couldn't train in swordsmanship or horseback riding outside. Therefore, he only moved enough to prevent his body from deteriorating and devoted himself entirely to book learning.\nImpersonating Felix was never difficult for Isaac. He had been by Felix's side, observing him more than anyone else.\nIt was also convenient for Isaac that Marcy, the head maid whom Felix adored, had retired.\nThe duke then thoroughly dismissed servants who knew Felix and assigned new servants to take care of the fake prince. There was no way he could be found out.\nThe only difficulty Isaac faced when taking over was that he couldn't find Felix's diary.\nIf he was going to impersonate Felix, he wanted to understand the diary's contents perfectly, but no matter how hard he searched, he couldn't find it. Felix had likely disposed of it secretly after resigning himself to death.\nBut I do remember that one page.\nThe childishly drawn image of his ideal prince.\nIf that was Felix's aspiration, then Isaac would recreate it as closely as possible.\nExcelling in swordsmanship, academics, kindness, gentleness to all, and chivalry towards women—— the perfect prince straight out of a fairy tale.\nThe only exception was that the Duke of Clockforde forbade him from learning magic, as Isaac and Felix had different affinities, which could reveal his true identity.\nNevertheless, Isaac secretly studied magic behind the duke's back.\nAfter all, the prince that Felix wished for had to be versed in magic too.\nMore importantly, learning magic might allow him to contract with a high-ranking spirit.\nIsaac moved the aquamarine from the necklace Felix left behind into a pocket watch with a hidden lid, always keeping it close. He put it in the inconspicuous pocket watch instead of wearing the necklace openly to avoid drawing the duke's attention.\nSometimes Isaac would gaze at the aquamarine in his pocket watch and lose himself in thoughts of its water-blue color, so reminiscent of Felix's eyes.\nSomeday, I'll definitely contract with a high-ranking spirit.\nBecause that's what Felix had always wished for——to be able to do the same as his mother.\nSo if that was Felix's wish… then Isaac would make it all come true. With that thought, Isaac devoted himself to studying magic.\nMore than anything, mastering magic would provide a powerful weapon against the Duke of Crockford when Isaac eventually turned against him.\nIsaac was convinced that someday, he would defeat the duke.\nFor now, he would obediently follow the duke's lead and use his power.\nBut once the throne was secure… then that man who had toyed with Isaac's and Felix's lives would be eliminated.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThree years passed since Isaac debuted in high society as Felix. Now fourteen years old, Isaac was enrolled at Serendia Academy's middle school level, despite his outward age as Felix being twelve.\nWhile under the duke's jurisdiction, Serendia Academy was a fully residential school, naturally allowing more freedom from the duke's watchful eye.\nBetween his studies and socializing, the enrolled Isaac devoted himself to studying magic.\nMagic was an advanced field of study. No matter how gifted he was, there were limits to what he could achieve alone. Hence, he focused solely on the subject of spirit summoning.\nStudying magic was challenging but not unpleasant. It seemed to suit Isaac's nature——the more he learned, the more he craved deeper knowledge and applications.\nIf he succeeded in summoning spirits, perhaps he could study practical magic as well. With such thoughts, Isaac persisted… and finally succeeded in the spirit contract ritual.\nThe spirit Isaac summoned was Willdean, the high-ranking water spirit residing in the late Queen Irene's aquamarine.\nThe summoned spirit had a form nearly human, but with water-tinted hair of an unearthly hue.\nThe outward age appeared to be in the mid-twenties. The pale aqua eyes looking down on Isaac reminded him of young Felix.\n\"Spirit Willdean. Lend me your power to fulfill my wish. This is a wish befitting one who once served Queen Irene.\"\nIt is said that spirits slumbering in spirit stones can vaguely glimpse the human world.\nThen this spirit should understand the general events from Queen Irene's death to the present.\nWith that in mind, the spirit asked its new master, \"What is your wish?\"\nIsaac answered with a faint smile, voicing his sole desire.\n\"I want to make a star shine in the night sky.\"\nJust as the hero Ralph left his name as a star, Isaac wanted to leave behind the name of Felix Ark Ridill.\nBecause that was Felix's wish in life.\nAs Isaac spoke those words, Willdean turned her pale aqua eyes towards him.\nWilldean was expressionless, as spirits tend to lack emotional fluctuations. And yet, for some reason, he looked sad to Isaac.\n\"…Is that Prince Felix's wish?\"\n\"Yes, that's what he told me in life.\"\n\"Is that all?\"\nFurrowing his brow at Willdean's words, Isaac silently urged her to continue. With what seemed a melancholic expression, Willdean said.\n\"Didn't Prince Felix wish for anything else?\"\nWilldean was hinting at something in a roundabout way.\nRecalling events from years ago, Isaac finally realized what he was referring to——the words Felix had spoken to him the last night they gazed at the stars together.\n——“I want you to find something you can become obsessed with, for your own sake alone, not for anyone else’s. I want you to find many things you truly enjoy and love, just for yourself.”\nHe had never forgotten those words, but he had intentionally avoided dwelling on them.\nBecause if I pursued my own likes, how could I become the perfect prince?\nA slight irritation rose within Isaac towards the spirit before him. Perhaps sensing it, Willdean averted her eyes.\n\"My former master Lady Irene once said this, ‘Even bound by the position of royalty, I hope my child never forgets to pursue individual happiness…'\"\nHowever, Queen Irene passed away shortly after giving birth to Felix, who was then shunned by his grandfather, never able to pursue individual happiness.\nDespite his love of the stars, his astronomy books were taken away, and he was scolded for wasting time on such trivialities.\nWith what feelings did Felix impart those words to Isaac, wishing him to find his own likes and enjoyments? Isaac fell silent, and Willdean told him.\n\"Please do not disregard Prince Felix's final wish…\"\nWhat the spirit said made sense to Isaac.\n——Because only Isaac could fulfill Felix's wish.\n\"This is troubling. I've already experienced all the leisurely pursuits befitting royalty.\"\nFor him, opera viewings and hunts were merely social obligations, not personal enjoyments.\nFrom the perspective of \"leisures Isaac could truly enjoy,\" such high society events seemed unsuitable.\nSomething I can immerse myself in, something I find enjoyable…\nSince taking over as Felix, the boy Isaac Walker had become thoroughly worn down, warped, and distorted.\nHe had pursued Felix's ideals to such an extreme that Isaac could no longer think of anything he truly wanted for himself.\n\"…Well then, I suppose I'll try indulging in some night revelry as an experiment. Willdean, as a water spirit, you must be skilled in illusion magic, correct?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Assist me in sneaking out of the dorms. Can you do that?\"\nAt Isaac's request, Willdean nodded. \"Yes.\"\nThen his form seemed to melt into water, its color shifting. When he regained his outline, his appearance was now identical to Isaac's——or rather, Felix's. This must be the spirit's illusory magic.\n\"As my master commands.\"\nEventually, once he became king, Isaac would have no time to pursue personal enjoyment.\nSo just for now. He would spend this brief period before kingship on the remnants of his life as Isaac Walker.\nAt that time, not knowing what he could immerse himself in, Isaac thought this way.\nAN: From then on, as Isaac started indulging in nightly revelries, Willdean was frequently left exasperated.",

      "content": "Two years had passed since Isaac advanced to the senior division.\nDuring these two years, Isaac frequently snuck out of the dorms to roam the streets at night whenever he had the chance. However, he had yet to find something he could truly immerse himself in.\nHe tried music, theater, stories, and the like, but he could never purely enjoy the works themselves. He was always too focused on analyzing things like the quality of the work or what ideologies were popular among the citizens.\nFor the sake of making connections that could help him later abandon the Crockford Duchy, he even visited brothels, but the lively banquets and time spent with beautiful courtesans still left him feeling like he was merely skimming the surface.\nFor a long time now, he had been too preoccupied with being \"Felix\" and had completely dulled his sensibilities as \"Isaac.\"\nSurely his heart had been numb ever since the real Felix died. That's why he could only skim the surface, his heart unmoved, unable to become immersed.\nNo matter what he experienced, he could only think about how \"Felix\" would react.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nOne day, Isaac learned that his hometown was completing a memorial monument for its reconstruction and holding an unveiling ceremony. Taking advantage of a long vacation, he secretly traveled to the eastern region.\nThough over ten years had passed since the Dragon Knight Corps rescued him, Isaac had never returned to his hometown. At the very least, he wanted to leave flowers for his deceased family while he still had the freedom to move about.\nAt that time, rumors of a black dragon sighting were circulating in the eastern region. However, if Isaac missed this chance, he might never visit his hometown again.\nThinking that, Isaac stubbornly proceeded with his plan, but his judgment was flawed.\nBy the time he arrived in the eastern region, the roads were already flooded with people abandoning villages and towns to evacuate.\nHaving come in secret, Isaac couldn't risk being noticed by the evacuees. As a result, he had to take quite a detour… and unfortunately encountered a flock of wyverns.\nThe Black Dragon Wogan that appeared in the eastern Kerbeck territory of the Ridill Kingdom was said to lead a flock of wyverns. Part of that flock had drifted this way.\nThe shrill screeching cries were different from the ferocious roars of the earth dragons that once attacked Isaac's hometown.\nHowever, when faced with overwhelmingly powerful giant creatures, the primal fear felt by humans remained unchanged.\nWhat's more, there were over twenty large wyverns present, each potentially a disaster on its own. How could this not be considered a great disaster?\nThough wyverns were lower-ranking among dragons, their sheer numbers and size could lead to catastrophic damage.\nJust a single wyvern gliding low overhead near houses could cause buildings to creak from the wind pressure alone. And its carelessly dropped sharp claws could easily tear through the bodies of livestock.\nThis flock of wyverns was essentially an intentional storm.\nEven the vaunted Dragon Knight Corps of the capital would likely suffer considerable casualties trying to exterminate such a flock.\nDragons were the beings that had once robbed Isaac of his family. At that time, Isaac was powerless and unable to protect even his younger brother.\nAnd now, faced with these overwhelmingly powerful creatures, Isaac was just as powerless.\nThe fear and despair he felt when he lost his family overcame his entire being——when suddenly, a clear ringing sound echoed.\nAt first, Isaac thought it was just a ringing in his ears, but no, it was different.\nSomething appeared above the circling flock of wyverns. It was a sharply glistening ice spear.\nBeautiful crystal-like ice spears pierced the brows of every single wyvern without exception, as if each spear had a will of its own, striking with perfect accuracy.\n…Was that magic?\nHowever, anyone with even a rudimentary understanding of magic would realize how superhuman that technique was.\nTo pierce over twenty wyverns with ice spears of such high magical density would require exquisitely precise control of mana akin to threading a needle. It was a miracle on par with a divine judgment.\nThe wyverns slain by having their brows pierced did not simply plummet to the ground as lifeless corpses. Instead, wind magic gently guided their falls, making them pile up on the earth.\nThe dragons that had once instilled a sense of powerlessness in Isaac were dispatched with such ease!!\nIsaac was utterly captivated by the sight before him.\nWhat beautiful magic! So serene, yet merciless——like the judgment of a god!!\nA shiver ran down Isaac's spine from the intense exhilaration and excitement.\nHis heart, which had forgotten the feeling of excitement for so long, pounded loudly. Hot blood coursed through his body, flushing his pale cheeks.\nAh, Isaac couldn't help but let out a breath of admiration.\n\"…It's like a miracle.\"\nLater, when Isaac learned of the witch who performed this miraculous feat, he pursued information about her——the Silent Witch——with an obsessive fervor, his eyes alight as if nothing else mattered.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nLarge raindrops pounded the earth, accompanied by the sound of wheels churning through wet soil.\nHaving just awoken from a light doze, Isaac's head was not yet fully alert, his mind tingling with the lingering sensation of his dream.\n…Ah, I want to meet Lady Everett.\nThe great Sage of the Seven Sages, the Silent Witch, who wielded intricate and beautiful magic ceremonies, instantly struck down the dreaded dragon hordes that symbolized humanity's fear.\nThe true heroine who made Black Dragon Wogan yield and repelled the cursed dragon of Reinberg.\nJust seeing her was enough to make his heart race, leaving him giddily infatuated like a lovestruck youth.\nHe wanted to get closer to her, to know her.\nTo etch into his eyes her wordlessly eloquent, unspoken magic ceremonies!\n\"Your Highness, we'll be arriving shortly.\"\nResponding with a short \"Hm\" to the coachman's words, he——Felix——turned his gaze outside. The rain-soaked window revealed the world had grown quite dark.\nChecking his pocket watch, he saw it was almost the final dismissal time. He would have enough time to return to the student council room and retrieve some documents before heading back to the dorms. He could review the documents' contents after returning to the dorms.\nThough he wore an overcoat when moving from the carriage to the school building, his uniform shoulders were still damp through the coat, and drops of water dripped from his hair.\nWell, since he was just retrieving documents before returning to the dorms, it didn't really matter. Felix briskly walked down the dim hallway. There didn't seem to be any other students left in the building, most likely having already returned to the dorms.\nAs he grasped the doorknob to the student council room, Felix was slightly surprised to find it unlocked. It seemed someone was still present. Cyril, perhaps?\nUpon opening the door, he saw a petite girl sitting primly on the sofa in the dimly lit room. It was Monica.\nWithout even turning on the lights, Monica was staring intently at the chessboard on the low table in front of her. She had the white pieces. Who was she imagining as the opponent's black pieces?\n\"You'll ruin your eyes like that,\" Felix said as he lit a lamp.\nAt the sound of his voice, Monica slowly raised her head to look at Felix.\nIn situations like this, the usual Monica would have widened her round eyes and let out an amused, peculiar sound. But the current Monica had a slightly dazed look in her eyes.\nThough it didn't seem like she was absorbed in calculations or chess either. Her slightly greenish eyes simply gazed straight at Felix.\n\"Have you been playing chess alone this whole time? We should leave soon, or we'll get locked in.\"\n\"……..\"\nInstead of responding, Monica slid a white pawn forward. It seemed to be white's turn now. Glancing at the board, it appeared the white and black pieces were more or less even.\nFelix moved a black knight, capturing Monica's white pawn.\nHe wondered if she would be upset that he moved her pieces without permission, but Monica merely stared silently at the white pawn removed from the board.\n\"…For example, if you had to sacrifice someone to have your wish granted…\"\n\"Hm?\"\n\"What would you do?\"\nFelix didn't hesitate with his answer.\nAfter all, he had already made that choice over ten years ago.\n\"If necessary, I would take that step.\"\nHe had once burned a dear person with his own hands.\nHe wouldn't flinch at a small sacrifice like this, not for the sake of becoming king.\nJust as he manipulated Emanuel Darwin, the Jeweled Magician, to assassinate the Duke of Crockford.\n\"If it's necessary for me to become king, I will surely do so.\"\n\"…Why do you want to become king so badly?\"\n\"Didn't I tell you before? It's because I have to become king.\"\nYes, Felix Arc Ridill had to become king——to etch his name in history.\nSo that people would never forget the existence of the pitiable, kind prince.\n\"……..\"\nSilently, Monica moved a white rook.\nPromptly, Felix moved a black knight, shifting the situation on the board to favor the black pieces.\nFor Monica to save her white king, she would have to sacrifice one of her other pieces.\n\"When having to sacrifice something to have your wish granted… I've always thought I could do it easily.\"\nThe meek, quiet girl confessed in a tone akin to self-admonishment.\nThat she was someone capable of sacrificing things.\n\"Because I never had anything precious. As long as I had numbers, that was enough.\"\nWhat Monica stared at was neither Felix nor the chessboard.\nIt was the captured white pawn removed from the board.\n\"I really thought I could easily, cruelly, abandon someone. But…\"\nMonica's hand drifted aimlessly across the board without touching any pieces before returning to her lap.\n\"When I learned my father died for someone else's wish… I didn't know what to do anymore.\"\nSurely, the usual Monica would have made her next move without hesitation. It was well-known at chess tournaments that Monica never took long to decide on moves.\nBut now, Monica was hesitating. In this situation where she had to sacrifice pieces to regain mobility.\nWith a sigh, Felix exhaled and swept his right hand across the chessboard, scattering the pieces.\nAt the now chaotic board, Monica's eyes widened as she looked back and forth between the board and Felix.\n\"Eh, um, uh…\"\n\"Life isn't necessarily like chess, with just black and white sides. Human relationships are complex. There aren't always just two factions.\"\nIn reality, political issues were incredibly convoluted.\nEven within the same \"white\" faction, there could be multiple sub-factions, and just when you thought there were only three or four factions, a new fifth faction would emerge.\nFelix returned the scattered pieces to their case. It was about time they left the school building before getting locked in.\n\"If you're feeling cornered, rely on those around you… Perhaps you can rely on me.\"\nAt those words, Monica looked like she was about to cry for some reason.\nHer small lips parted as if to say something but then closed again.\n\"…Monica?\"\nAs Felix reached out to touch Monica's cheek, she abruptly stood up, as if evading his hand.\nThen, in a strained voice, she declared:\n\"Benedict Rayne.\"\nUnfamiliar with the name, Felix gave Monica a puzzled look. She squeezed out her words with a desperate expression as if holding back tears.\n\"No matter what choice I make from here, no matter what future I end up in… please, never forget this name. Absolutely, absolutely never forget it.\"\nWith those words, Monica fled from the student council room as if running away.\nAs the door slammed shut, Felix repeated the name to himself.\nBenedict Rayne.\nAn unfamiliar name, and yet, it felt like he had seen it somewhere before.\nFrom the context of the conversation, it was likely the name of Monica's deceased father?\n…I should look into it a bit.",

      "content": "Special thanks to Lauren for the donation.🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️\nHere's a bonus chapter.\nThe drizzle that had been falling during the day turned into heavy rain just as Monica ran out of the school building. Without a coat or umbrella, Monica kicked through the muddy ground as she raced towards the girls' dormitory.\nWhy did I mention my father's name…?\nTelling Felix her father's name had been an impulse.\nBenedict Rayne.\nHe was the sacrifice to make you king.\nEven if you don't know that truth, please, please don't forget his name.\nWhen Monica spoke her father's name, Felix didn't seem surprised or perplexed, so he likely wasn't directly involved in her father's death.\nStill, Monica didn't want Felix to forget her father's name. That feeling was almost like a curse. Please, please don't forget… the name of the father you caused to die… a curse like that.\nArriving at the girls' dormitory, Monica wrung out her dripping skirt and took a deserted hallway to the attic room.\nWhat do I want to do…?\nWhen Monica lived in the mountain cabin, the only precious thing she had was a keepsake coffee pot.\nCutting off ties with others, she only had to face numbers, and that was enough.\nBut after coming to Serendia Academy and interacting with people bit by bit, she gained new treasures——close human connections.\nSo to protect this place… she could be as cruel as needed to anyone who threatened it.\nWhen she fought Yuan disguised as Cyril.\nWhen she struck down Hubert Dee.\nWhen she faced the emperor of the neighboring country.\nAgainst anyone who hurt or took away her precious people, Monica could act heartlessly and mercilessly.\nAnd now, Monica is faced with a choice.\nIf she reveals everything Duke Crockford has done and denounces the fake Prince Isaac Walker, she may be able to prove her father's innocence——her deepest wish, that her father was killed by conspiracy unfairly.\nBringing the whole truth to light would grant Monica's wish.\n——But then Ike would be executed. An unprecedented great crime of impersonating the Second Prince.\nIf proving her father's innocence, fulfilling her wish, means discarding Ike…\nShe could do so coldly and mercilessly, like removing a chess piece.\nI… can't.\nBack in her room, Monica pressed her still loudly thumping heart and wiped her damp hair with a cloth. Nero then scampered up to her feet, looking up at Monica while wagging his tail.\n\"Hey, was it really okay for you to mention your old man's name? If people find out you're the Silent Witch, that'd be bad, right?\"\nLooking closely, Nero's fur was damp too——it seemed he had been watching the exchange in the student council room from outside the window.\nMonica gently picked up Nero and wrapped him in the cloth.\n\"It's fine… When Miss Hilda took me in, she hid my background.\"\nOfficially, Benedict Rayne's daughter was taken in by her uncle, with Hilda hiding Monica's relation to her father to prevent persecution. So even if it's revealed she's Benedict's daughter, it shouldn't connect to her being the Silent Witch.\n\"Well if you say so. So what're you gonna do from here? You promised that bigwig from the Empire you'd avoid war, didn't you?\"\n\"…Yeah.\"\nThough she had declared she would avoid war to the Emperor, Monica had no concrete plan. Stroking Nero's back, Monica racked her brain intently.\nPlan 1:\nAsk Duke Crockford \"Please don't start a war.\"\nOf course, he wouldn't lend an ear to her opinion.\nPlan 2:\nAdvise the King that Duke Crockford wants war.\nBut the current King is bedridden, so that's difficult too.\nPlan 3:\nReveal that the Second Prince's identity is fake, ousting Duke Crockford and his group. This is the simplest and surest method. If she reveals the truth before Felix becomes King, she can barely prevent civil war. Moreover, by bringing the whole truth to light, she can assert her father's innocence.\n…But Ike would likely be executed along with Duke Crockford's faction.\nPlan 4:\nInstall First Prince Lionel as King instead of Felix.\nThe most realistic and desirable option is Plan 4. The First Prince doesn't want war, and moreover, his mother is a princess of Randall Kingdom. If it goes well, their alliance with Randall could be strengthened as a deterrent against war.\nThe problem is that at present, the Second Prince's faction is too powerful. With the backing of Duke Crockford's authority, the next King is certain to be the Second Prince under normal circumstances.\n\"Ugh… looks like we have to do something about Duke Crockford…\"\n\"Hey, don't you have any good leverage to threaten him with?\"\n\"Leverage against Duke Crockford…?\"\nMonica furrowed her brow in thought, prompting Nero to wag his tail as he pondered, then looked up with realization and poked Monica's cheek with his paw.\n\"How about this! ‘We know the Second Prince's secret. If you don't want this revealed, cede the throne to the First Prince.'\"\nIndeed, that would allow them to avoid revealing the Second Prince's true identity while containing Duke Crockford's ambitions. A rather clever idea from Nero.\nTo prevent both war and Ike's execution, this may be the only option.\n\"Yeah… That might be, the only way. In that case, we just need to decide where to negotiate with the Duke…\"\nIn three weeks, there is a garden party at the castle to celebrate the blooming roses. This marks the start of the nobility's social season. The garden party is overseen by Duke Crockford himself.\nAs one of the Seven Sages and a magic baronet, Monica has received an invitation as expected.\nIf she attends, she can find an opportunity to negotiate with Croxford Duke.\nThe biggest issue is whether I can properly negotiate with the Duke though…\nPerhaps it would be wise to write down everything she wants to say, in case she can't speak properly at that time.\nHaving finally seen a glimmer of hope, Monica began drafting a letter accepting the garden party invitation, as well as notes for her negotiation with Duke Crockford.\nThreaten Duke Crockford, and prevent Felix from becoming King to avoid war. That's all Monica can do right now.\nHowever, to do that, she needs Ike to relinquish his claim to the throne.\nIke, I'm sorry… I don't understand why you're so fixated on the throne, but…\nShe cannot allow him to become King and plunge this country into war and chaos.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"So the Second Prince really is an impostor…\"\nIn the study of Ridill Kingdom's castle, the Barrier Magician Louis Miller looked over the documents in his hands as he leaned back in his chair, clearing his throat.\nBeside him, Lynn muttered, \"As expected of Sir Louis. You wear the wicked smile so well.\"\n\"I'll pretend I didn't hear that remark, considering your efforts in gathering these materials.\"\nThe main documents in his hands were the career record of a doctor named Arthur who had previously served Duke Crockford's household, as well as materials on body manipulation magic.\nThe Star Oracle Witch had said the Second Prince's star became unreadable ten years ago. When Louis heard that, he had a hunch\n——Could it be that the Second Prince had already passed away, and the one at Serendia Academy was an imposter?\nHis suspicions were bolstered by the Empire agents skilled in body manipulation magic who infiltrated twice.\nThus, Louis Miller reached one conclusion:\n——Duke Crockford conspired with Imperial agents to create a fake Second Prince amenable to him using forbidden magic.\nFrom the moment the King ordered him to guard Felix, Louis had doubts. He was known to support the First Prince, so why did the King assign him to the Second Prince's guard…?\nBut now, the answer was clear.\n\"His Majesty is quite crafty… He must have noticed the Second Prince could be an impostor. So he assigned me, waiting for the Second Prince to slip up, knowing I would meticulously pick apart anyone I dislike.\"\nAt Louis' words, Lynn impassively clapped her hands in realization.\n\"In other words, the King exploited Sir Louis' petty lover by finding faults in those he dislikes.\"\nLouis was in too good a mood to take offense at his contracted spirit's insult. This was a chance to bring down both Duke Crockford and the Second Prince after all.\nFor Louis, who openly admits his love of bullying the strong, there could be no greater delight.\n\"Now, where should I reveal this fact? Ah, there's a garden party in three weeks. I'll announce it there… ‘Duke Crockford conspired with the Empire to install a false Second Prince——he is a great criminal.'\"\nLouis' eyes gleamed behind his monocle as Lynn asked, \"Shall I report this to the Silent Witch?\"\n\"No, keep silent. That inept actress shouldn't know the truth yet.\"\nMore importantly, Monica has recently become a bit too easily swayed by emotion. If the impersonator playing Second Prince and Duke Crockford end up executed, she'll likely be shaken.\nThen the Silent Witch should continue her infiltration until the fake Second Prince is completely ruined. Louis hummed as he planned how to reveal the truth at the garden party.\n\"By the way, Sir Louis. I have an urgent matter.\"\n\"Speak, if it's not too pressing.\"\n\"I just received word that Lady Rosalie has gone into labor.\"\nYou idiot maid!! Before the foolish maid could finish, Louis cast a flight spell and shot out the window like a bullet.",

      "content": "Emanuel Darwin, one of the Seven Sages known as the Jeweled Magician, was trying his best to maintain composure before the person seated in front of him——the Duke of Crockford, Darius Knightley.\nFelix had ordered Emanuel to poison the Duke of Crockford, and several days had already passed.\nEmanuel had been agonizing over when and how to do it. When he was suddenly invited to a dinner party at the Duke of Crockford's residence.\nIt was not really a dinner party per se, but more of a private meeting between just the Duke and Emanuel to discuss recent developments.\nThis was a chance. But when should he poison the food? He had to time it perfectly so he wouldn't be suspected. If caught, it would mean his end, which is also his ruin.\nAfter much thought, Emanuel decided to poison both his and the Duke's meals. He would then pretend to take a bite, act like he noticed something odd, and spit it out.\nIf only the Duke's meal was poisoned, Emanuel might be suspected, but if they were both poisoned at the same time, suspicion would be less likely to fall on him.\nThus, Emanuel had already snuck into the kitchen beforehand and laced both their meat dishes with poison.\nAll he had to do was put the meat in his mouth at the same time as the Duke, chew it without swallowing, and when the Duke showed signs of being poisoned, Emanuel would pretend the poison was affecting him too and spit out the meat in his mouth. A perfect plan.\nEmanuel put on a polite smile and brought the soup to his lips.\n\"Well, well, this pea soup is so smooth! The cooks at the Duke's residence are truly skilled.\"\n\"Have you found a new apprentice yet?\"\nIgnoring Emanuel's flattery, the Duke bluntly asked his question. Knowing the Duke disliked wasting time, Emanuel dropped the pleasantries and answered the topic the Duke had raised.\n\"An apprentice… well, no, I haven't found a suitable craftsman yet…\"\nPreviously, an apprentice working for Emanuel had quit the workshop after losing faith in him. This caused delays in fulfilling orders at Emanuel's company.\nMore importantly, the Duke of Crockford had invested a large sum into Emanuel's company.\n\"I will surely find one by the end of this month…\"\n\"That's fine.\"\nThe Duke concisely cut off Emanuel's words with a single word. Taking it to mean he didn't need to rush, Emanuel breathed a sigh of relief, but…\n\"You no longer need to search for an apprentice.\"\nUnable to comprehend the true meaning of those words, Emanuel froze. What did those words mean? Before Emmanuel could voice that question, the Duke declared, \"You always eat the meat dish first, but today you haven't touched it.\"\nThe plate clinked softly as Emanuel's trembling hands holding it shook. That small sound seemed to echo loudly in the room.\n\"What's wrong? Won't you eat?\"\n\"Ah, no, it's just… my stomach isn't feeling quite right today…\"\n\"Is that so?\"\nThe Duke glanced sideways with his pale blue eyes, making eye contact with a servant standing by the wall. The male server approached Emanuel, lifted the meat dish, and tilted it over Emanuel's soup bowl. The sautéed meat plopped into the pea soup, clouding its color with meat juices. However, the servant didn't seem to mind, and methodically, meticulously stirred the soup with a spoon.\n\"If it's soup, you can drink it, can't you?\"\n\"But, this is a bit…\"\nAs Emanuel tried to make excuses to escape drinking it, the Duke gave him a cold look.\n\"If you wish to demonstrate your loyalty, you'll drink it all.\"\nSweat burst from Emanuel's entire body. The green peas and meat juices had mixed into a murky soup. The poison Emanuel had added had seeped out from the meat and fully dissolved into it.\n\"A, ah…ah…\"\nWith trembling hands, Emanuel scooped up the soup with a spoon. He had no idea how much poison was dissolved in that single spoonful, or how potent that poison was.\n\"Uu…uuuu~~\"\nThe spoon slipped from his shaking hands, spilling the murky soup onto the tablecloth.\nEmanuel fell to the floor, pressing his forehead into the carpet.\n\"I'm so sorry! I was instigated by Prince Felix!!\"\nThere was no point in pretending anymore. This terrifying Duke had seen through everything.\nHe knew Emanuel had poisoned the food. He knew who had ordered him to do it.\nEmanuel had witnessed time and time again the merciless, cruel Duke purge traitors as a harsh example. So throwing away all shame and dignity, Emanuel pleaded for his life.\n\"It was a momentary lapse in judgment! My loyalty is solely for you! Please, have mercy…eh?\"\nThe last word trailed off unnaturally because his tongue had started tingling.\nIt wasn't just his tongue tingling. His fingertips, toes, the extremities all over his body were tingling and prickling.\nGradually, his pulse became erratic. As if his heart had been punched, it started pounding unnaturally, leaving him breathless.\n\"…A, a…wha…? …An, why…?\"\nThese were symptoms of poisoning.\nBut Emanuel hadn't eaten any of the meat yet.\n\"D-Did you…put the poison…in the soup…from the start…\"\n\"Did you think I would allow a bat that doesn't know the meaning of loyalty to remain by my side?\"\nAs Emanuel foamed at the mouth, clutching his throat as he begged the Duke for help, for mercy, the Duke no longer even looked at him. The Duke turned his gaze towards the direction of Serendia Academy and muttered softly, \"So he did betray me after all.\"\nThere was no need to specify who \"he\" referred to.\nThe Duke of Crockford had foreseen the Second Prince's betrayal.\n\"Then you shall be of use in cleaning up that mess.\"\nWhen the Duke turned his eyes back towards Emanuel, he had already died in agony with an anguished expression on his face.",

      "content": "A week had passed since Monica revealed her father's name to Felix.\nFelix's attitude toward Monica remained unchanged, frighteningly so. That's why Monica tried her best to act as normal as possible, so as not to let her feelings show… or so she thought.\n\"Did His Highness say something to you?\"\n\"Fueeh!?\"\nMonica, who was organizing documents with Cyril in the archive room, accidentally dropped the bundle of papers she was holding. Although they didn't scatter since they were bound with a string and had a thick cardboard cover, the cover struck her instep, causing a dull pain.\nGiving Monica an exasperated look, Cyril watched as she awkwardly laughed and picked up the dropped papers.\n\"No… he didn't… say anything. It's… the usual.\"\n\"……..\"\nCyril stared at Monica with sharp eyes, but then took the bundle from her hands and put it on a high shelf that Monica couldn't reach.\n\"I heard from General Affair Maywood that you turned down the offer to be on the new student council.\"\nMonica shuddered. It seemed Cyril thought her suspicious behavior was caused by that.\nA few days ago, Neil, who had officially been chosen as the next student council president, had asked her, \"Won't you be the treasurer again next year?\"\nEssentially, student council members are appointed upon the president's recommendation. Considering that Monica and Neil would soon be the only remaining members after the others graduated, it was natural for her to be asked to continue. Neil would likely find it easier to work with an experienced member.\nHowever, Monica had turned down the offer.\nHer bodyguard duties for Felix would end upon his graduation, and Monica would have to return to her life as the Silent Witch of the Seven Sages. Her life as Monica Norton had only a month and a half left.\nAs Monica hung her head, Cyril said while organizing the shelves:\n\"You don't want to continue as a council member?\"\n\"Well…\"\nSquatting down to put old documents in a box, Monica pondered.\nWhat would her answer be if she were an ordinary student and not an undercover Seven Sage?\nIf I stayed on the student council next year, I could interact with all sorts of people through events, and Lana and Glenn would be there too during events…\nThe scene playing out in her mind seemed to sparkle brilliantly.\nBut it only sparkled because it was an unattainable dream for Monica.\nSeeing Monica's distant gaze, Cyril seemed to think of something and paused his work to look at her.\n\"I believe one should always evaluate things fairly and impartially.\"\n\"I, I see.\"\n\"And based on that… I evaluate that you've done well.\"\nMonica blinked in surprise, and Cyril cleared his throat awkwardly, his words speeding up slightly.\n\"Your administrative skills… especially with numbers, you're faster and more accurate than anyone. Ever since you became the treasurer, the review of past records has progressed better than expected. That's an accomplishment. Your negotiation skills might need some improvement, but the fact that you remain impartial and unswayed by self-interest regardless of who you're dealing with is commendable.\"\nCyril looked straight into Monica's eyes with his blue ones.\n\"More than anything, I sense a willingness to make an effort in areas involving interpersonal relations, which you struggle with. During the school festival and the student assembly, for instance. You're still immature and have many shortcomings, but I appreciate your efforts.\"\nFlustered by the unexpected praise, Monica's face quickly turned red.\nShe had been complimented many times in the past for her skills as a mage, like her non-incantation magic and the spells she developed.\nHowever, she rarely received praise for her own efforts or attitude toward tackling challenges.\nShe didn't know it could make her heart race like this.\nLips quivering, Monica instinctively covered her flushed cheeks with both hands.\n… Lord Cyril praised me.\nBeing praised by someone usually so harsh with criticism felt incredibly gratifying.\nEspecially since he had been her mentor of sorts this past year.\n\"In other words, I believe you are well-suited to be a student council member next year. So I'll ask you again.\"\nCyril straightened his posture to face Monica directly.\n\"Are you sure you don't want to stay on the student council next year?\"\nHands still covering her cheeks, Monica thought about how fortunate Monica Norton was.\nEven without the prestigious title of a Seven Sage, she could still be acknowledged and needed by others.\n…Have a helping hand extended to her.\nIt was a happiness Monica had given up on long ago.\nEven if Monica Norton's existence was a fabrication, Monica vowed secretly to never forget the joy she felt as Norton.\nFor all those memories and that joy were precious treasures to Monica.\n\"…I'm afraid it's an opportunity I must decline.\"\nSeeing Monica smile wryly with furrowed brows, Cyril seemed to realize there was no point in persuading her further.\n\"I see,\" he muttered, resuming his work. \"Tomorrow there's a meet-and-greet with the new student council member candidates. Let's finish organizing these documents by today.\"\n\"Yes. Um, what kind of people are the new candidates?\"\nCyril looked a bit surprised at Monica's question.\n\"You haven't heard? At this point, the candidates are Robert Vinkell, Glenn Dudley, Miss Eliane Hyatt… and your friend Miss Lana Colette is also a candidate.\"\n\"Eh, ehh!?\"\nThe names Cyril listed were all Monica's friends and acquaintances.\nCyril seemed surprised by Monica's reaction as well.\n\"…I thought you weren't enthusiastic about next year's student council because you dislike Robert Vinkell, but…\"\n\"No, I had no idea about any of this.\"\nNow that she thought about it, Lana had been grinning rather meaningfully lately… This must have been the reason.\nWhile Lana's family doesn't hold a high noble rank, she aims to start her own trading company one day, so she's quite skilled with calculations.\nEliane is the most well-known young lady among the first-years, and Glenn became hugely popular after the school festival.\nThough an eccentric bunch, Neil should be able to manage them well.\nBut the most surprising candidate was Robert.\nImages of Robert Vinkell energetically rolling up his sleeves to show off his toned arms, even in early spring, came to Monica's mind.\n——\"If I become a student council member like Miss Monica, I can play chess in the student council room.\"\nHe would definitely say something like that. Definitely.\nAs Monica's cheeks tensed with the thought, Cyril made a sour face and said,\n\"The vice president plays a crucial role in supporting the president. As such, academic excellence is required. Which makes Robert Vinkell's candidacy… quite unexpected, despite being the top student among the first-year transfers.\"\nJudging by his strained tone, Cyril likely had reservations too.\nMonica gave an awkward smile and asked the disgruntled Cyril,\n\"Speaking of which, won't Lady Claudia be a student council member?\"\n\"…Do you think she would be?\"\n\"…No, I suppose not.\"\nUndoubtedly, the highest-achieving second-year in the senior curriculum was Cyril's sister, Claudia Ashley.\nHowever, while Claudia was the top student, she was also known for her problematic personality.\nStill, with her fiance Neil becoming president, Monica had thought Claudia might be considered… but it seemed Neil had excluded her from the start.\nApparently, Neil had confided to those around him.\n——If my fiancée is on the council, I might unconsciously play favorites with her.\nWhen Claudia heard this, she was reportedly in a very good mood, saying, \"That's right, Neil does play favorites with me.\"\n\"…That does sound like Lady Claudia.\"\nAs the two exchanged smiles, the archive room door opened, and Felix peeked in.\n\"Ah, there you two are. Is the work going well?\"\n\"Yes, we'll finish it by today.\"\nWhile Monica awkwardly looked away, Cyril responded to Felix as usual in a crisp manner.\nFelix gave a warm smile, glancing between Cyril and Monica.\n\"I have some errands to run, so I'll be leaving first today. Tomorrow's a day off, but there's a meet-and-greet with the new and old student council members in the morning, so don't forget to come to the student council room.\"\nAfter Cyril and Monica responded, Felix said, \"Well then, see you later,\" and turned to leave.\nAs the archive room door closed, Monica thought she might have briefly made eye contact with Felix.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nBack in his dorm room, Felix took off his uniform jacket and tossed it aside, then pulled out an outdoor jacket and a black wig from his wardrobe.\nThe lizard-shaped Will, crawling out of Felix's pocket, asked in a perplexed tone,\n\"…Aren't you done with your night revelry?\"\n\"There's just something I need to confirm. Don't worry, I'll be right back once I've checked.\"\nA week ago, Monica had mentioned a name——Benedict Rayne.\nIt was unfamiliar, yet Felix felt like he'd seen it somewhere before. Until he finally remembered where he had come across that name.",

      "content": "As far as Isaac could remember, the owner of Porter's Antiquarian Bookshop was always sitting at the counter in the back of the store, quietly writing. But unusually, today the counter was empty.\nThe door wasn't locked, so he must not be away.\nAs Isaac approached the back of the store and called out \"Porter,\" the door behind the counter opened, and the owner, Porter, poked his head out.\nPorter was usually a man with ink stains on his hands or clothes, but today he was dressed more neatly, as if ready to travel. He wasn't wearing his glasses.\n\"Pardon me, were you about to go out?\"\n\"…Ah, it's you.\"\nPorter put on the glasses he had left on the counter and put on the hat he was holding.\n\"I just finished the manuscript and was about to take it in for publication. I was planning to use the royalties to go on a buying trip.\"\n\"It seems I've arrived at a miraculous time, then.\"\nPorter, who was known to be away for years at a time, would likely have been gone for a while if Isaac had arrived a day later.\nAt Isaac's joking remark, Porter tilted the brim of his hat slightly and gave a wry smile.\n\"…Miraculous, you say. Ah, a terribly clichéd turn of phrase, but you must have the power to summon miracles and fate. You are extraordinary, the protagonist of a story…whether that is a blessing or a curse, I cannot say.\"\nHe then sat down in the chair. It seemed he was willing to engage in conversation.\nSomehow, Isaac felt that Porter had guessed why he had come to the shop. So he decided to get straight to the point.\n\"I'd like to ask you about a person named Benedict Rayne.\"\nThat was the name Monica had mentioned a week ago.\n\"…No matter what I choose from here on, or what future I end up in…please, remember this name. Never, ever forget it.\"\nIsaac had never heard the name Benedict Rayne before, but he had seen it. A few months ago, when he had visited the bookshop with Monica, she had been looking for a book by that author.\nIsaac had only glanced at the book, so Monica probably didn't think he had remembered the author's name.\nWhen Monica wanted that book again, Porter mentioned that the author was a friend of his, so Isaac was a little curious and looked at the author's name.\nPorter leaned his cheek on his hand at the counter and let out a sigh. His breath made the candlestick's flame flicker, and the silhouette of a man wearing a hat also wavered.\n\"Benedict Rayne. He was one of my few friends, a scholar. What kind of scholar, you ask? That's a difficult question to answer. Benedict had outstanding knowledge in fields like medicine, mathematics, physics, biology, and even magic… He was a rare, true genius, designing everything from coffee pots to medical instruments to magic tools.\"\nPorter rested his chin on his interlocked fingers, looking up at Isaac.\n\"You said you've read my novels under the name Dustin Gunter, right?\"\n\"I think I've read all of them.\"\n\"Then you'll understand this. Benedict Rayne was trying to create a magical artifact similar to the Black Grail.\"\nThe Black Grail was an important item that proved the legitimacy of the royal bloodline.\nA bad premonition began to stir and churn in the depths of Isaac's chest.\nWatching Isaac's unconscious gesture of pressing his chest, Porter fixed him with a dark gaze.\n\"In his later years, Benedict was researching genetics. I don't fully understand the technical details, but apparently, his magic tools could analyze blood, skin, and other samples to detect genetic diseases early on and identify blood relatives.\"\nIf such an artifact truly existed, the one most threatened would be…\nThe Duke of Crockford, who was protecting the false prince.\n\"Ultimately, Benedict died before his artifact was completed.\"\n\"Was it due to illness or something?\"\n\"He was executed for using forbidden magic. The inquisitors conducted hardly any investigation, didn't even hear his defense, and carried out the execution by burning at the stake with unnatural haste.\"\n\"…And where was he executed?\"\n\"In the town of Rosemaria.\"\nRosemaria was not in the Duke of Crockford's territory, but the local lord was one of Crockford's loyal vassals.\nThe conditions were alarmingly aligned with the hypothesis forming in Isaac's mind.\n…No, surely not…\nPorter watched Isaac's tense expression with an impassive, observant gaze, not missing even the slightest change.\n\"Benedict had lost his wife early on, but he had a daughter.\"\n\"…\"\n\"He even brought one of my novels as a souvenir, but the strange girl was only interested in math books, showing no interest at all.\"\nAh, yes. Long ago, at the tea party, the poisoned Monica had been muttering in her delirium, \"Don't burn it, don't burn it.\"\n\"…What happened to that daughter?\"\n\"After her father's death, she was taken in by relatives. I don't know what became of her after that.\"\nIf Isaac's suspicion was correct——no, he was now almost certain of it.\nBenedict Rayne, Monica's father, had been murdered by the Duke of Crockford to prevent the true identity of the Second Prince from being exposed.\nFor the sake of Isaac Walker's objective, Monica's father had died.\nThe one who had once burned the body of a dear person with his own hands was not averse to dirtying those hands for the sake of his purpose.\nJust as he had threatened Emanuel's weakness, or maintained the name of Felix Ark Ridill, he could do anything.\nBut now, for the first time, Isaac's mind was creaking, and he felt the urge to abandon his thoughts.\nWas it my fault that Monica's father died? Did Monica know that? Is that why she mentioned his name that time?\n——To have a wish granted, sometimes you have to sacrifice something…\n——I always thought I could do that easily. But when I realized someone's father died for my wish…I didn't know what to do.\nWhat was Monica's wish? It was obvious——to prove her father's innocence and absolve his unjust death.\nAnd what did she have to sacrifice for that wish?\n…Me.\nThat day, to the troubled Monica, he had said \"Perhaps you can rely on me\" with that thin, commonplace kindness.\nWhat a jester I am…the cause of her father's death being \"rely on me.\"\nBefore he knew it, a cold sweat was seeping into his palms, and his mouth was dry as a bone. His head throbbing.\nTo the silently dumbstruck Isaac, Porter declared.\n\"Earlier I said you are extraordinary, a major character in the story.\"\nPorter stood up, his chair scraping loudly, casting an unusually large shadow.\n\"But your story will never be told. It will be buried in the darkness of history.\"\nThe youth obsessed only with leaving his master's name behind, having lost his own face and name, asked in a dry voice,\n\"…Is that a prophecy?\"\n\"Hardly. Just the ramblings of a novelist. Not even good enough for material in a new work.\"\nPorter shrugged nonchalantly, in a manner unclear how serious he was being.\nWatching him, Isaac convinced himself.\nAh, you're right Porter. My story is unnecessary in history.\nThe story that needs to be told is not Isaac Walker's.\nThe story that will be told in history is that of Felix Ark Ridill.\nAnd yet, the fact that one girl had lost her father for that weighed heavily on his chest now.",

      "content": "On the carriage ride back, Isaac gazed absentmindedly out the window, thinking about a certain girl.\nThe strange girl who appeared wherever he went.\nShy, timid, and bashful, but when it came to numbers, her eyes changed color.\nShe didn't seem like an assassin or a bodyguard, so Isaac didn't pry too deeply into her true identity. Instead, he enjoyed observing her.\n…And gradually, he began to feel affection for her.\nHer meek demeanor, how she quickly blamed herself, and how she apologized after every other sentence——it reminded him of the young Felix. Whenever that happened, Isaac couldn't help but want to reach out and care for her.\nWhat was Monica thinking each time he reached out to her?\nHer excessively thin body, the old scars on her back. Her fearful behavior around others' gazes.\nIt wasn't hard to imagine the hardships she must have endured after her father was executed.\nEventually, the carriage arrived at the dormitory. Even after returning to his room late at night, Isaac couldn't sleep.\nHe made some perfunctory response to the concerned Willdean, then lay in bed, lost in thought.\nIsaac Walker was the kind of person who could eliminate any obstacle for his goal. He had resolved himself to that when he cremated an important person's remains with his own hands.\nIf he adhered to that resolution——then Monica Norton, who seemed to have realized the truth, should be eliminated.\nAnd yet, Isaac didn't feel the slightest urge to do anything about Monica.\nHe had noticed that Bridget was shocked when Felix and he switched places. But Isaac felt no pain.\nEliane and Cyril admired the princely Felix Ark Riddil. Even though Isaac knew he was deceiving them, he felt no guilt.\nHe could be as ruthless as needed to preserve Felix Ark Riddil's name. But when he thought of Monica, his blood froze, and his innards felt as heavy as if he had swallowed a lump of lead.\nHow should he face Monica from now on?\nNo matter how much he pondered, he couldn't find an answer. Before he knew it, morning had arrived.\nAh, he probably hadn't spent a sleepless night like this since the night he cremated the real Felix's remains with his own hands.\nThat night, even as he wished the morning would never come, he had stared unblinkingly as the curtains grew brighter.\n\"…Your Highness?\"\n\"What is it, Willdean?\"\n\"…No, it's nothing.\"\nWilldean, in his butler attire helping Isaac dress, seemed to want to say something but closed his mouth. Once Isaac was ready, Willdean stood by the wall.\nIsaac sat on the sofa, vacantly gazing at the chessboard he had left out.\nBack then Monica had been staring intently at the pawn outside the board. He wondered how that pawn had looked to her then.\nWithout touching any pieces on the board, Isaac blankly stared at the chessboard.\nIt was a day off today, but in the morning, there was a meet-and-greet with the new student council candidates. As the current student council president, he had to make an appearance.\nStill, he hadn't figured out how to face Monica… Until the very last minute, he sat glaring at the chessboard.\n\"Shall we get going soon?\"\n\"Yeah, I know… Let's go.\"\nWilldean bowed, then transformed from a human shape into a lizard, slithering into Isaac's pocket.\nConfirming that Willdean was completely out of sight, Isaac left the room.\nSince it was a day off, there weren't many people in the entrance hall. But just then, Cyril's shouting voice came from the opposite direction——the junior students' rooms.\nLooking that way, Isaac saw Cyril dragging Glenn along at a brisk pace.\n\"Honestly, how long are you going to sleep in! I told you there's a meet-and-greet with the new and old student councils today!\"\n\"But we didn't have to do it on a day off, did we… Ugh, sleepy…\"\nLetting out a big yawn, Glenn had Cyril mercilessly twist his ear.\n\"Owowow!\" Glenn let out a shriek, his hair still mussed from sleep. He had probably forgotten about the meet-and-greet and was indulging in his usual laziness when Cyril came to rouse him.\n\"Good morning, you two.\"\nWhen Isaac called out, Cyril straightened his back and greeted him.\n\"Good morning, Your Highness!\"\n\"Ah, mornin' Prez. Were you almost late too, Prez? Overslept?\"\nAt Glenn's words, Cyril shot him a piercing glare.\n\"Don't lump His Highness together with you, Glenn Dudley. If you keep sleeping in, I'll shove ice down your mouth.\"\n\"Uuuu…\"\nStill seeming sleepy, Glenn was unfazed by Cyril's scolding, leisurely kneading his own cheeks.\nAs Isaac watched their exchange with an inexplicably amused feeling, the entrance hall's outer door opened.\nAt this hour, someone coming from outside? Maybe a student returning from being out?\nWith a perplexed look, Isaac turned around——and his eyes widened slightly. Cyril and Glenn, too, had surprised expressions.\nEntering through the doorway one after another were soldiers in armor. The crest engraved on their armor was different from that of the academy's security troops. Those were soldiers from the royal castle.\nThe Serendia Academy was an institution under the influence of the Duke of Crockford. Even the king couldn't easily interfere. Allowing armed soldiers into the dorms was unprecedented.\nAmong the soldiers, a man who seemed to be their captain strode straight toward Isaac.\nIsaac met the captain's gaze with a cold, intimidating look.\n\"Are you aware that this is a sacred place of learning that shelters noble children? State your affiliation and name, for barging in armed like this.\"\nDespite Isaac's chilling aura that could intimidate\neven a big man, the captain showed no sign of faltering. Instead, he raised his voice resoundingly.\n\"You, the imposter who conspired with the former Seven Sages' Jeweled Magician Emanuel Darwin and deceived us by posing as Prince Felix Ark Riddil! For the crime of attempting to overthrow the state, I hereby place you under arrest to be taken to the royal castle. You can make all the excuses you want there!\"\nCyril reacted faster than anyone to these words.\n\"His Highness is an imposter!? Don't be ridiculous, have your eyes checked!!\"\n\"Makes no sense to me! That's our Prez, plain as day!\"\nGlenn echoed Cyril's raised voice.\nBut the soldiers paid no heed to Cyril and Glenn.\n\"What a pity for you, the imposter prince. Your co-conspirator Emanuel Darwin couldn't bear his guilty conscience and committed suicide. His dying confession revealed everything, including that you're an imperial magician!\"\nEven in this situation, Isaac's head automatically tried to analyze things calmly instead of getting flustered.\nIf Emanuel had truly committed suicide, it would be strange for his dying confession to state that Isaac was an imperial spy. So either someone was taking advantage of Emanuel's suicide, or Emanuel was murdered.\nIsaac asked in a calm tone,\n\"…Is the Duke of Crockford aware of this?\"\n\"Of course. The Duke was deeply grieved to learn that his precious grandson had been killed.\"\nUpon hearing those words, Isaac became certain.\nThis soldier was working for the Duke.\nAnd Isaac… had been abandoned by the Duke.\nI had anticipated that one day, the Duke would abandon me… but this is too soon.\nThe swap between Felix and Isaac was a meticulously planned scheme that took immense time, money, and effort.\nIsaac hadn't expected to discard it so easily.\n…Ah, so that's why the Duke brought Prince Albert into the fold.\nWhen the plan to make the Second Prince the king and control the nation from the shadows failed, the Third Prince Albert was kept as an insurance policy.\nThe Duke of Crockford likely intended to support the Third Prince and maneuver to make Albert the king. And the Third Prince's mother, Princess Phyllis, probably approved of this too.\nIt wouldn't be too difficult to fabricate a story about the Second Prince being an imposter exposed by the Third Prince, and rally support for the Third Prince.\nEven his elaborate scheme of swapping places could be discarded without hesitation if needed… That cold pragmatism was the Duke of Crockford's terrifying quality, Isaac realized anew.\n\"Come now!!\"\nTwo soldiers moved to apprehend Isaac from either side. Cyril's face paled as he shouted,\n\"Your Highness!\"\nAlmost reflexively moving to intervene, Cyril stopped when Isaac calmly shook his head.\n\"Cyril.\"\nCyril waited for \"Felix's\" command to scatter these insolent soldiers.\n\"I leave the student council to you.\"\nWith only those words, Isaac boarded the prisoner transport carriage along with the soldiers detaining him.\n——This was my retribution.\nTo his own surprise, Isaac's heart was serene.",

      "content": "The new and old student council officers were gathered in the student council room of Serendia Academy. There was Neil, the current student council president and next year's president, Elliot and Bridget, the current secretaries, and Monica, the current treasurer.\nThe candidates for next year's student council officers were Roberto for vice president, Eliane for secretary, and Lana for treasurer. They were just waiting for the arrival of Felix, Cyril, and Glenn.\nMonica, who didn't know until yesterday that Lana had been selected as a new student council officer, wanted to talk to her, but there was someone else who caught her attention even more.\nLana seemed to agree, glaring at that person——Claudia, who was sitting snugly next to Neil.\n\"W-Why are you here? Didn't you turn down the offer to become a student council officer?\"\nClaudia, with her usual doll-like expressionless face, answered Lana, who was voicing the feelings of everyone present.\n\"…That's right, there's no way I'd take on such a troublesome role.\"\n\"Then why are you here? Today is a meeting for the new and old student council officers, you know?\"\nAt Lana's words, Claudia lifted the corners of her mouth and leaned against Neil with an evil smile that would make even the wicked witch of a story envious.\n\"…I am Neil's private secretary. Do you un-der-stand?\"\n\"There's no way I could understand that.\"\nLana's cheeks twitched as she looked at Neil.\n\"Hey, is that even allowed?\"\n\"Well, you see…\"\nAs Neil made a troubled face, Claudia's arm slid around his neck.\nClaudia clung tightly to Neil's left side and said in a flat voice,\n\"‘Student Council Regulations, Article 17-3: The student council president may appoint one or more vice presidents, secretaries, treasurers, and general affairs officers, up to a maximum of two each. In addition, the president may appoint volunteer assistants as needed.'\"\nIn other words, it seemed that Claudia was one of these \"volunteer assistants\".\nAn assistant is someone who does not have the authority of a student council officer, but is more like a volunteer.\nHowever, it goes without saying that Claudia is not the type to quietly devote herself to volunteer work.\n\"It's obvious that she just wants to be near her fiance without doing any troublesome work.\"\n\"Well, actually, it's not quite that simple.\"\nSurprisingly, it was Elliot, the current secretary, who scolded Lana as she groaned in a low voice.\nElliot glanced at the resource room and scratched his cheek, looking a little awkward.\n\"When Claudia helped me organize the guest list for the graduation ceremony, it went so smoothly… Not only does she have book knowledge, but she also has a grasp of the marital relationships in high society. Plus, she has memorized all the coats of arms of the domestic nobility, so the work goes by quickly… Even the heraldic officers would be put to shame.\"\nClaudia basically dislikes being relied upon by others.\nHowever, it seems that she is willing to overlook some troublesome matters if it means being by Neal's side.\nThat's just like Lady Claudia…\nAs Monica smiled wryly, Roberto, who was sitting in a distant seat, raised his hand as if to show off his rolled-up sleeves.\n\"I also have something I'd like to confirm.\"\nMonica had a bad feeling about this.\nBy the time she thought that, Roberto was already looking at her with clear eyes.\n\"I thought Miss Monica would continue to be a student council officer next year, but is that not the case?\"\n\"What!? Isn't Monica going to be the treasurer too!?\"\nAt Roberto's words, Lana's eyes widened as she looked at Monica.\nMonica smiled bitterly and lowered her gaze slightly to the desk.\n\"Um… I think I've done enough this year, so…\"\n\"I haven't played enough chess with Miss Monica yet. Miss Monica, if we're both student council officers, we'll have more opportunities to interact and it will be easier to secure time to play chess. Please consider continuing as treasurer.\"\n\"It's ridiculous to be a student council officer just to play chess. But I thought I'd be able to work as treasurer together with Monica…\"\nMonica's heart ached when Lana looked dejected, even if Roberto was being unreasonable.\nEven so, there was no Monica Norton next year.\n\"…Um… I…\"\nJust as Monica was about to make an excuse, the door to the student council room swung open with force.\n\"Emergency, emergency, emergency!\"\nThe one who rushed in shouting in a voice that echoed throughout the student council room was, needless to say, the loudest man at Serendia Academy, Glenn Dudley.\nIt was nothing new for Glenn to be noisy, but today he seemed to be acting strange.\nGlenn, with a desperate look on his face, was grabbing Cyril's arm. It seemed that Cyril had been dragged here by Glenn.\nCyril looked exhausted, as if just standing was all he could manage, and he was looking down, his face pale.\nBridget muttered, \"How noisy,\" and Eliane put her hand to her mouth, saying, \"Oh my, oh my.\"\nAmidst all this, Elliot scratched his head in exasperation and asked Glenn, \"Hey, what's going on? Did Cyril faint from anemia or something?\"\nEven Elliot's teasing words didn't get a reaction from Cyril. He kept his head down, muttering something under his breath, and it was clear that something was seriously wrong.\nGlenn shook his head vigorously from side to side and shouted, \"Suddenly, soldiers from the castle barged into the dormitory… saying something about the ‘Jeweled Magician' committing suicide, or something about treason… I don't understand what they're talking about…!\"\nThe ‘Jeweled Magician' Emanuel Darwin was a fellow member of the Seven Sages to Monica.\nMonica was utterly shocked to hear that Emanuel had committed suicide.\nHowever, the shock didn't end there.\n\"Those guys started saying that the president is a villain… that the Second Prince is an impostor… and they took the president to the castle like he was some kind of criminal!\"\nMonica gasped.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nEmanuel Darwin, the Jeweled Magician of the Seven Sages, committed suicide by poisoning himself in his study at home.\nOn the desk in his study, there was a suicide note that stated the following:\nDespite being one of the Seven Sages, Emanuel Darwin was blinded by greed and betrayed the Ridill Kingdom.\nHe secretly assassinated the Second Prince in collaboration with the Imperial Magician, a user of body manipulation magic.\nThe Imperial Magician successfully impersonated the Second Prince.\nThis Imperial Magician is none other than the person currently known as Felix Ark Ridill.\nThis fake Second Prince was plotting to take over the Ridill Kingdom and make it a vassal state of the Empire.\nEmanuel Darwin gradually became terrified of what he was doing and decided to take his own life and confess everything here…\nAs Lynn read the report in a monotonous voice, Louis Miller listened while filing his nails in his study at home.\nBlowing on his nails, which he had trimmed shorter and rounder than usual, Louis muttered bitterly,\n\"To think that they would make the first move… Lynn, does that report also include a summons?\"\n\"Yes. It says that the Seven Sages are to gather in the Jade Room as soon as possible.\"\nThe castle was probably in a state of chaos by now.\nNow that the plan had gone so awry, even Louis needed to rethink his next move.\n\"Lynn, go to Silent Witch immediately and report what you just told me. She can't use flight magic, so you'll have to take her to the castle.\"\n\"What about you, Sir Louis?\"\nTo Lynn's question, Louis Miller, one of the Seven Sages known as the Barrier Magician, said with the face of a warrior going to the battlefield,\n\"Of course, I'm heading to the castle. But before that… today for sure… today for sure, with my own hands.\"\n\"With your own hands.\"\n\"I will put Leonora to sleep.\"\n\"………\"\nIt would not be an exaggeration to say that the Miller household currently revolves around their newborn daughter, Leonora. Moreover, Louis Miller, who adored his wife, was very cooperative when it came to childcare.\nHowever, for some reason, Leonora would cry like she was on fire only when Louis held her.\n——Even this useless maid can hold her and put her in a good mood, let alone Rosalie!\nIn other words, the most pressing matter for Louis Miller right now was to get his adorable daughter to warm up to him.\nTo the earnest new father trying to get his daughter to like him, Lynn flatly told him, \"Perhaps Lady Leonora is frightened by the smell of blood that has seeped into you, Sir Louis.\"\n\"How rude. I'm not foolish enough to get drenched in blood from a fight.\"\n\"……\"\nTo Louis, who looked offended, Lynn posed a rare, legitimate question.\n\"Is it alright not to head to the castle immediately?\"\n\"Even if I hurry to the castle, it's probably in a state of chaos right now. It's obvious that the information is all jumbled up.\"\nBesides, the Seven Sages meeting couldn't start until the Silent Witch arrived… although now there were only six sages.\nI'll need to take care of that girl's withdrawal procedures from the academy soon.\nIf the Second Prince, who was supposed to be under her protection, was gone, there was no reason for the Silent Witch to remain at Serendia Academy.\nMoreover, now that one of the Seven Sages' seats had become vacant, they needed to start the selection process for the next sage.\nWell then. I just hope that girl doesn't do anything unnecessary until then.\nAs he put away the nail file in the drawer, Louis sighed with a worried look on his face.",

      "content": "The Jeweled Magician committed suicide.\nAnd the Second Prince was taken to the castle, accused of being an impostor.\nAs Monica listened to Glenn's incoherent ranting, she glanced at Bridget. Bridget also glanced at Monica for a moment.\nEven Bridget, who had suspected that Felix might be an impostor, probably didn't expect this development. Her beautiful face was stiff and pale.\nIn the first place, although she wanted to meet the real Felix, she never wished to condemn the impostor and reveal the whole truth, so this reaction was natural.\nEveryone else looked confused, unable to understand what Glenn was saying.\nHuh?\nMonica felt something was off. There was only one person who didn't look surprised or confused but had a cold look in their eyes as if they had foreseen this situation.\nAs Monica stared at that person, Neil spoke up.\n\"Everyone, please calm down. Glenn, please sit down first. You too, Vice President Ashley.\"\nAt Neil's words, Glenn fidgeted and stamped his feet.\n\"This isn't the time to calm down, Neil! The president was taken away, you know!? If I chase after them with my flight magic, I might still be able to catch up…!\"\n\"And what will you do if you catch up? If you forcibly try to take back the student council president, you'll just end up getting wanted along with him, right?\"\nGlenn was at a loss for words, and Neil spoke in a voice that suppressed his agitation.\n\"First, let's sort out the information… and think about what to do next.\"\nNeil Clay Maywood didn't have the charisma that Felix had. Most people would describe Neil as \"a nice guy but doesn't seem reliable,\" and above all, they would try to judge him solely by his baronial rank.\nWhen it came to selecting new student council officers, many declined the position, saying they didn't want to serve under a baron's family. That's why the newly selected members had their own quirks.\nRoberto, the fifth son of a baron's family from a neighboring country; Lana, from a baron's family; and Glenn, a commoner… The only one with a higher rank than Neil was Eliane from a ducal family. Since Eliane wasn't a male heir, few people made an issue of it, but if Eliane had been a boy, there would surely have been some who raised their eyebrows.\nIn the end, the new student council officers didn't have as much support from the students as Felix's generation did.\nNevertheless, Neil, who was trying to take control of the situation, had the presence of a new student council president.\n\"Vice President Ashley, please tell us the situation to the best of your knowledge.\"\nEven when Neil prompted him, Cyril seemed unable to snap out of his dazed state.\nWhen Neil called out to him again, \"Vice President Ashley!\" Cyril finally seemed to come to his senses and slowly raised his head.\nIt was understandable that Cyril, who respected and admired Felix the most, would be so shaken… but with only Glenn's explanation, the conversation would never move forward.\nCyril probably understood this too. In a voice that sounded like he was about to die, he slowly began to recount what he knew.\nAccording to the soldiers who took Felix away, the Imperial Magician who used body manipulation magic and infiltrated the chess tournament conspired with Emanuel Darwin, the Jeweled Magician, to plan the takeover of the Second Prince.\nThey failed to switch places at the chess tournament and were captured, but managed to escape.\nLater, the Imperial Magician infiltrated the academy again, successfully killed the Second Prince, and took his place.\nThe Imperial Magician was plotting to take over the country, but the accomplice, the Jeweled Magician, couldn't bear the weight of his sins and committed suicide by drinking poison, leaving everything in a suicide note.\n…That was the explanation Cyril had heard.\nAs she listened to the explanation, Monica desperately tried to process the information in her head.\nWho spread the information that the Second Prince was an impostor? The Black Lion Emperor of the Empire? No, that's not it.\nIf this incident was the work of the Black Lion Emperor, he wouldn't have leaked the information in a way that implied \"the impostor = the Imperial Magician\".\nHinting at the Empire's involvement could spark a war. The Black Lion Emperor, who wanted to avoid war, wouldn't do that.\nRather, if they wanted to make it seem like the impersonation of the Second Prince was the work of someone from the Empire, the culprit became clear.\nIt's the Duke of Crockford.\nMonica couldn't tell if the Jeweled Magician committed suicide or was murdered. But judging from the situation, it was reasonable to assume that he was used as a sacrificial pawn to ensure Isaac's downfall.\nMonica didn't know why the Duke of Crockford suddenly decided to abandon Ike, but something must have started moving without her knowledge.\nThose who were skeptical of Glenn's explanation seemed to gradually understand the seriousness of the matter as they listened to Cyril's explanation.\nRoberto raised his hand to speak.\n\"It sounds like a preposterous story, but I don't think it's impossible that the Second Prince was replaced by an impostor. In fact, at the chess tournament, the assassin disguised as Eugene Pittman perfectly deceived the students of Minerva.\"\nYes, everyone present knew about the fake Pittman incident at the chess tournament.\n…And they also knew that the assassin had escaped.\nFor those who didn't know about Yuan, the theory that the Second Prince was an impostor was quite credible.\nAmidst all this, Neil quietly spoke up.\n\"Everyone, let's refrain from speculating at this point as we have too little information. Glenn, were there any other witnesses when the president was taken away?\"\n\"Well, I don't think there was anyone else around… but there were a lot of soldiers, so I'm sure a few people must have noticed.\"\n\"So the story hasn't spread that far yet? …In that case, can I ask everyone here to keep quiet about this to the other students?\"\nWhen Bridget affirmed Neil's words, saying \"That's the sensible thing to do,\" Elliot interjected.\n\"But I think the perceptive students will eventually come to us with questions. Should we still feign ignorance even then?\"\n\"If anyone tries to make a fuss, just tell them this: ‘We can't spread uncertain information because it involves the royal family's prestige.' ‘Those who spread uncertain information may be charged with lese-majeste.'\"\nBridget stated firmly, and Neil nodded in agreement.\n\"We don't know what will happen to the student council from here on. But I think we should try to grasp the current situation and think about the future.\"\n\"So, is there anything I can do? I'll do anything to help the president!\"\nGlenn probably wanted to go and help Felix right away because he looked up to him.\nTo Glenn, Neil furrowed his brows slightly in a troubled manner and said,\n\"For now, I'd like all the new student council officer candidates to return to the dormitory. We'll explain what happens next later. I'm going to the faculty room with Vice President Ashley to discuss what to do from here… if that's alright with you, Vice President Ashley?\"\n\"…Y, yes.\"\nCyril's response was slow when Neil called out to him. He probably still couldn't come to terms with reality.\nAs everyone looked at Cyril with pity, only Claudia looked at him coldly.\n\"…Now that the current student council president is absent, the vice president should be the one taking charge… If the vice president is in this state, the president's efforts will be in vain.\"\n\"Miss Claudia!\"\nEven when Neil scolded her, the coldness in Claudia's eyes didn't change.\nCyril slowly raised his head, put his hand on his forehead, and exhaled slowly.\n\"No, it's fine. You're right, Claudia. Until he returns… I must do what needs to be done as the student council vice president.\"\nCyril, who muttered those words, still looked haggard and seemed like he might collapse at any moment.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nIn the end, the new student council officers temporarily disbanded.\nIt was decided that Elliot, Bridget, and Monica would stay in the student council room, while Cyril and Neil would go to the faculty room to report.\nCyril scolded himself for feeling faint and put strength into his legs.\nI have to pull myself together.\nJust before Felix was taken away, he had told Cyril that he was leaving the student council in his hands.\nIf so, Cyril had to live up to those expectations.\n…However, just as they left the student council room, Claudia stopped and grabbed the hems of Cyril and Neil's clothes.\nClaudia, who was neither a new nor an old student council officer, had no reason to be here in the first place.\nEspecially in this emergency situation, she should naturally return to the dormitory.\n\"Claudia, you should go back to your room.\"\n\"…Three people.\"\nClaudia muttered softly and let go of their clothes.\nNeil asked Claudia,\n\"What's wrong, Miss Claudia?\"\n\"…When I heard Glenn Dudley's report, there were three people who reacted strangely.\"\nClaudia held up three fingers of her right hand with her usual gloomy expression.\n\"First, Monica Norton. When it happened, Monica instinctively looked at Bridget Graham. Second, Bridget Graham. She also instinctively looked at Monica.\"\nAs Cyril frowned at the strange combination of Monica and Bridget, Claudia turned her eyes to the student council room and continued.\n\"…And the third person…\"",

      "content": "Monica, who was left in the student council room, glanced sideways at Bridget.\nShe looked like she might collapse at any moment, but she still straightened her back bravely and glared at the grain of the table. Being the intelligent person she was, she was probably trying to sort out the information and grasp the current situation.\nOn the other hand, Elliot was sitting with his arms crossed, but he suddenly scratched his head and lifted himself from his chair.\n\"I feel a bit restless. Shall we have some tea?\"\n\"No thanks.\"\nDespite saying he was restless, Elliot seemed much calmer to Monica.\nElliot shrugged his shoulders and returned to his seat. Bridget turned her amber eyes to him.\n\"You're quite composed. As His Highness's childhood friend, shouldn't you be more shaken?\"\n\"There's no point in getting worked up. There's nothing we can do.\"\nMonica, who had been listening to their exchange, couldn't help but look at Elliot.\n\"…Lord Howard, you're His Highness's childhood friend?\"\n\"Well, yeah, we've known each other since we were about six years old.\"\nBridget must have met Felix at around the same age. However, it seemed that Elliot and Bridget only had the common point of being \"Felix's friends,\" and there was no interaction between the two.\nMonica felt that various questions were finally falling into place.\n…So that's how it was.\nMonica closed her eyes and recalled the words Elliot had said to her in the past.\nSeveral small questions and doubts that Monica had were finally starting to connect.\n\"…I always wondered. Lord Howard, you're very particular about social status, so why don't you use honorifics with His Highness…?\"\nWhen Monica said that awkwardly, Elliot narrowed his droopy eyes and smiled thinly.\n\"I told you, we're childhood friends.\"\n\"Is that… all?\"\nMonica couldn't accept the reason that Elliot didn't use honorifics with Felix just because they were \"childhood friends.\" After all, Elliot was a thorough classist.\nHe was a man who insisted that commoners should act like commoners and nobles should act like nobles, so it was only natural that he would show more respect to royalty.\nBut why didn't he do that?\n\"…Lord Howard, could it be that you knew? That His Highness was an impostor.\"\nBridget's eyes widened in surprise as she stared at Elliot.\nElliot still had a thin smile on his face, looking at Monica as if he found it amusing.\n\"Hey, hey, Miss Norton. What's your proof?\"\n\"Earlier, when Glenn reported that His Highness had been taken away… you didn't seem surprised, Lord Howard.\"\nAt that time, Monica had instinctively looked at Bridget… and then she noticed. Elliot, who was sitting next to Bridget, had an unusually calm expression.\n——That was the face of someone who had realized something, as if to say, \"Ah, I knew it.\"\n\"You once told me, Lord Howard, that commoners born with talent are used by cunning people. You said you knew someone whose life was ruined that way…\"\nThat was when the chess elective class had just started.\nThose were the words Elliot had spoken when he was talking about his own standing.\n——\"Commoners born with rare talent are often either envied by the incompetent or… used by cunning people. I know one person whose life was ruined that way.\"\nMonica clenched her fists on her lap and looked straight at Elliot, asking,\n\"The person whose life was ruined, as you said, Lord Howard, could it be…\"\nThe sound of dry applause interrupted Monica's words.\n\"I'm surprised you remember such an old story.\"\nAs Elliot said with a wry smile, Bridget stared at him as if she couldn't believe what she was seeing.\n\"What do you… mean…?\"\nElliot didn't answer.\nBridget shouted, losing her patience.\n\"What do you mean?!\"\n\"Don't yell at me like that.\"\nElliot tried to calm Bridget down with a wry smile. Still, seeing Bridget's attitude as if she might grab him at any moment, he scratched his head with a resigned look.\n\"You remember, don't you, Miss Bridget? The old His Highness was a real coward, a crybaby, and a weak child who was bad at both studying and sports.\"\nMonica had also heard that story from Bridget.\nThat the real Felix in his childhood was a very unreliable prince.\n\"The first time I met His Highness, I was furious. To think that such an unreliable person would be royalty standing above others. It's a joke to think that we have to bow down to someone like him!\"\nElliot was basically a pushover, but he was relentlessly harsh and mean to those he didn't like. It seemed that hadn't changed since his childhood.\n\"One day, I played a prank on His Highness when no one was looking. I hid a book that His Highness cherished on top of a tree. I told him to retrieve it himself without asking his attendants for help. His Highness climbed the tree on the verge of tears… and fell, seriously injuring himself. He had to get several stitches on his side.\"\nMonica remembered that when she had spent a night strolling in the red-light district before, there was a scar on Ike's side.\nAt that time, he had said, \"This is a necessary scar.\"\nMonica now understood that it was necessary for him to impersonate the real prince.\n\"His Highness was seriously injured because of me. Moreover, the scar would remain for life. Of course, I thought I would be executed, and I was trembling in fear. But His Highness protected me… He said he got hurt because he was fooling around. He said I didn't do anything.\"\nElliot paused and exhaled. Then he put a bitter smile on his lips.\n\"When I asked His Highness why he protected me, guess what he said? …He said it was his own fault for not being good at climbing trees.\"\nBridget muttered, \"That's just like him.\"\nElliot also lowered his gaze a little and had a nostalgic look in his eyes.\n\"Yeah, it's really frustrating…\"\nJust that one sentence seemed to convey how Elliot felt about the real Felix.\nElliot also looked up to him, just like Bridget did.\nThe prince was a coward, a crybaby, bad at both studying and sports… but kinder than anyone else.\n\"When I was about eight years old, His Highness fell seriously ill. He couldn't receive visitors, he couldn't write replies to letters, it was that serious. Of course, I was worried. And after more than a year had passed, when I finally thought I could see him again…\"\nAh, yes. Monica knew what happened next. So did Bridget.\n…Elliot's face twisted ironically.\n\"He had become the perfect prince.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nWhen Elliot met Felix again after a long time, he had grown much taller compared to a year ago. His skin, which had always been pale and lacked color, had become completely healthy-looking.\nThe old Felix had a beautiful face, but he was always timidly looking down and couldn't make use of his good looks at all.\nBut now he carried himself with confidence. Even though he wasn't even ten years old yet, it was as if he knew how to use his appearance.\nElliot, who had been invited to a party at the ducal family's villa, was simply astonished at the sight of Felix.\nFelix, who had always been unconfident and tried to stay still, being mindful of the gazes around him so as not to make a blunder and be scolded by his grandfather, was now mingling with adults in a dignified manner and responding to the dances of the young ladies.\nEveryone was praising Felix as a \"wonderful prince.\"\nAfter the party was over, Elliot snuck away from his father's watchful eye and visited Felix's private room alone.\nHe felt that he had to talk to him one-on-one no matter what.\n\"Hey, long time no see, Elliot.\"\nThe smile with which Felix greeted Elliot was soft and gentle, no different from the Felix that Elliot knew. Yet, why did it feel so strange?\n\"…You seem like a different person.\"\n\"It's been a while since we last met.\"\n\"…You really are His Highness, right?\"\nWhen Elliot asked in a stiff voice, Felix chuckled and lifted the hem of his shirt.\nThe scar on his smooth, white skin was from when he had fallen from the tree.\n\"Look, I still have the scar from that time, don't I?\"\nIndeed, the scar was the same as the one from that time. Yet the sense of unease only grew.\nAs Elliot stared at Felix's face, he suddenly noticed something.\nFor a moment… just for a moment, he saw disgust in Felix's eyes.\nThe traces of disgust disappeared in the blink of an eye. But Elliot didn't miss that disgust.\n——After all, Elliot knew those eyes.\n\"He\" had always looked at Elliot with eyes of disgust.\nWhen Elliot was bullying Felix, and even after they became close following the incident where Felix got hurt. \"He\" had always hated Elliot.\nEvery time Elliot came, \"he\" would greet him with a composed face. And yet, \"he\" would let strong disgust seep into those blue eyes!\n\"Y-You… the one-eyed attendant…!\"\nElliot didn't bother to remember the faces and names of servants from other households. Even so, he remembered that particular attendant well.\nIt was not only because he had a somewhat handsome face but hid the right side of it with long bangs, but also because that attendant was always by Felix's side.\nWhen Elliot mocked Felix, the attendant would glare back at him despite his position.\nWhen Felix fell from the tree and was seriously injured, the attendant looked like he might attack Elliot, he was so enraged.\nThe color of the attendant's eyes was very similar to Felix's, but unlike Felix's vivid light blue, they had a hint of green mixed in… yes, the same color as the \"Felix\" in front of him.\n\"Why… where is the real His Highness…?\"\nThe expression disappeared from the face of the \"Felix\" in front of him.\nThe next moment, Elliot's feet were swept out from under him, and he was lying on his back on the carpet.\nThen \"Felix\"——no, the attendant with Felix's face——straddled Elliot and lightly dug his thumb into Elliot's throat.\n\"You're an eyesore after all… now and then.\"\nThe flat way of speaking undoubtedly belonged to the young attendant Elliot knew.\n\"What the hell is this? What's going on with that face… it's exactly the same as Felix's…!\"\nAt this point, Elliot didn't even care about the pain in the back of his head that he had hit.\nWhen Elliot shouted in a strained voice, the attendant with Felix's face looked down at Elliot with a displeased expression.\n\"Of course. I was raised to become his body double. This face was also remade for that purpose.\"\n\"Body double…? Then where is the real Felix now…?\"\nThere was a creaking sound. It was the sound of the \"Felix\" in front of him grinding his teeth.\nThe boy in front of him was no longer trying to maintain Felix's expression.\nHe had the same face as Felix, but with an expression of hatred that Felix would never make.\n…Elliot couldn't tell who that hatred was directed at, though.\n\"When His Highness Felix found out that I was his body double, he took his own life to help me escape.\"\nIn a voice filled with hatred, like a curse, the attendant with Felix's face said as if savoring it, as if telling himself,\n\"It's as if I killed him.\"\nFelix was dead.\nThat boy who was kinder than anyone else… had taken his own life.\n\"He climbed onto the roof himself and fell to his death… How many times have I wished that you, Elliot Howard, had never taught His Highness Felix how to climb trees.\"\nThe attendant laughed darkly at the speechless Elliot.\n\"Lord Felix was afraid of being forgotten by people after his death. Then I should become Felix Ark Ridill. I'll engrave this name in history as an excellent king so that no one will ever forget him.\"\nWhat the hell am I facing right now?——Elliot was confused.\nThe former attendant, whose face had been remade to look exactly like Felix's, seemed like something inhuman to Elliot.\nAt the very least, this wasn't sane.\n\"You're out of your mind… for a mere commoner to impersonate royalty, it's not just presumptuous… it's abominable.\"\n\"So what?\"\nThe attendant applied a little more pressure to the finger on Elliot's throat. Just by putting a little strength into that finger, the attendant could stop Elliot's breathing.\nThe attendant peered into Elliot's face, which was beading with sweat on his forehead. Elliot, reflected in those darkly stagnant eyes, had a face contorted with fear.\n\"If you wish for the prosperity of the Howard family, you'd better forget about this. The moment you speak of it, the Duke of Crockford will use every means possible to destroy your family… So please, don't get in my way.\"\nAh, that's right. There's no way a mere attendant could carry out such an outrageous plan alone. The Duke of Crockford was pulling the strings.\nIf that was the case, even if Elliot were to spread the word that \"the Second Prince is an impostor,\" no one would believe him. On the contrary, the Howard family would undoubtedly be crushed.\nSo the attendant made sure to drive the point home not to do anything unnecessary, and then he got off of Elliot.\nElliot slowly sat up and glared at the attendant.\n\"I know that those who recklessly cross the boundaries of status always end up destroying themselves. You too will surely ruin yourself someday.\"\nThe attendant with Felix's face mocked Elliot, who was putting on his best show of bravado.\n\"If it's after I've engraved my name in history as a hero, I'll accept any kind of ruin. That's what a foolish attendant who let his master die deserves.\"\nThis attendant probably no longer feared his own destruction.\nWhat this attendant feared was that the name of Felix Ark Ridill would be forgotten.\nAs long as he could protect Felix's honor, this attendant would do anything.\n\"Then I'll watch as a bystander. I'll witness the end of the clown who impersonates royalty… When you meet your downfall, I'll laugh at you with great fanfare. ‘I told you so, serves you right!'\"\nAt Elliot's words, the blue eyes that had been stagnant until now regained a little transparency.\n\"Yes, please do witness it… the end of the clown.\"\nElliot finally realized.\nThe one this attendant hated, the one he mocked, the one he cursed… was none other than himself.",

      "content": "After Elliot finished speaking, he let out a long, deep sigh.\nA slight tinge of fatigue seemed to seep into his face. Was it from talking too much, or was he overwhelmed by strong emotions from the past?\nIn contrast to Elliot leaning back against the backrest, Bridget had her hands clasped on the table, pressing her entwined hands against her forehead as she hung her head. Her beautiful profile was tense and rigid.\n\"…What in the world. To think that servant from back then was… Ah, if it's that man, it makes sense that he would share the His Highness' memories… He was always by his side after all.\"\nHer muttering voice grew softer and softer. Bridget covered her eyes with her trembling hands.\n\"…The real His Highness had already… passed away.\"\nThe whispered words that fell were sorrowful.\nAlthough Bridget had vaguely realized that the real Felix was dead, it seems she still couldn't completely let go of hope somewhere deep inside.\nShe wanted to believe that… the real prince was still alive, merely confined somewhere…\n\"…And to think he took his own life for that servant's sake…\"\nAs Monica listened to Bridget's anguished murmurs, she gently lowered her eyes.\nMonica already knew that the real Felix was dead and that the current Second Prince was his former servant Isaac Walker, who had switched places with the real prince during the fire at the duke's mansion.\nHowever, all Monica knew were the \"facts\" of what had happened in the past.\nShe didn't know what Isaac was thinking at the time, or what he had wished for. Unlike Elliot and Bridget, Monica didn't know Isaac from his days as a servant.\n… Why does he just go along with what the duke says, I wondered…\nThe words he had said to her on the night of the school festival resurfaced in Monica's mind.\nAs he gazed up at the night sky, he had said this:\n——\"…even in his death, the Hero Ralph still leaves something to us in the brilliant night… and wouldn't it be wonderful if we could leave something like that as well?\"\nHe had wanted to leave his mark in people's memories.\nHe had discarded his face and name to become the duke's pawn, all so that the name of his master—Felix Ark Ridill, who had died to let Isaac Walker escape—would live on.\nThe flickers of obsession that sometimes showed in his eyes were all connected to this truth.\nAs Monica and Bridget fell silent, Elliot shrugged his shoulders with a slight laugh. Although he was laughing, his smile seemed somewhat stiff and awkward, like a failed attempt at humor.\n\"There's no need to feel regretful for not seeing through his disguise. That bastard's acting was disgustingly perfect… It's ironic, though. He couldn't hide his loathing for me, and as a result, I was the only one who saw through him in the end——the person he hated most.\"\n\"Lord Howard… do you still think that man was a fool?\"\nFor Elliot, a staunch classist, a commoner falsely claiming to be a prince was the most abhorrent existence imaginable. Yet Monica couldn't detect any hatred from Elliot.\nElliot himself seemed aware of this. With a slight upturn of the corners of his mouth in self-deprecation, he muttered:\n\"If only I could think of him as a fool… That would make things easier.\"\nElliot slouched against the backrest, ruffling his bangs carelessly as he mumbled.\n\"Ah, that's right. I've come to realize there are those like Cyril and Miss Norton who overcome the barriers of social class through hard work and talent. And I can't easily dismiss such people! Damn, I really do lack resolve… I've always thought that fake prince should just be executed swiftly!\"\n\"…What do you mean?\"\nThe three of them started at the voice coming from the entrance.\nThe door to the student council room was slightly ajar. Standing there with a deathly pallor was Cyril, with Neil and Claudia behind him.\nAs Elliot murmured, \"You were listening?\" Cyril rushed toward him with the speed of a wild animal and grabbed him by the collar.\n\"What do you mean?! Are you saying the prince was already an imposter when I first met him?!\"\nCyril's shout was almost a scream.\nElliot looked at the hysterical Cyril with a pitying gaze.\n\"If you were listening to the conversation, then you understand. Yes, the prince has been an imposter for the past ten years. By the time you met him in middle school, the switch had already happened.\"\n\"That's a lie!\"\nAs Cyril screamed hysterically, Elliot slowly shook his head.\n\"If you want to believe it's a lie, then go ahead. But the reality is that he's an imposter, and he'll likely be executed as a criminal soon… He must have slipped up and gotten on the duke's bad side, the fool.\"\n\"…You…!!\"\nCyril raised his fist toward Elliot. But instead of swinging it down, he started trembling uncontrollably, unable to move.\nFor Cyril, a commoner by birth, Felix——the one who had acknowledged him——was an absolute existence.\nBecause Felix had acknowledged him, Cyril was able to hold his head high without becoming servile.\nFor someone like Cyril, the fact that Felix was an imposter was an unimaginably cruel reality.\nCyril exhaled roughly a few times, \"Haah, haah,\" but eventually released his grip on Elliot and dashed out of the student council room.\n\"Lord Cyril!\"\nMonica hurriedly chased after Cyril's retreating back.\nCyril had just rounded the corner of the hallway, which was a dead end. Despite her sluggish pace, Monica moved her feet desperately to follow him.\nAt the end of the hallway, Cyril was leaning against the wall, head bowed, punching it with his fist.\nUnsure of what to say to console him, Monica hesitated as she approached his back.\nThe reason Monica didn't want to reveal the truth even though she knew it was because she didn't want Isaac to die and above all, for the sake of those who admired the current Felix Ark Ridill.\n——If they knew the Second Prince was an imposter, there would surely be people who would be hurt.\nWhen she had thought that, the first person who came to mind was Cyril.\nFor him, who took pride in being acknowledged by Felix, having Felix's existence denied would be equivalent to having his own existence denied.\n\"…It truly is a foolish tale.\"\nRealizing Monica was there, Cyril spoke in a hoarse voice without turning around.\n\"I once told you to take pride in being chosen by the prince… Yet look at me now.\"\nBack when Monica had just become a student council member when she was trembling at the thought of being unworthy of the position, Cyril had told her not to be servile and to hold her head high.\nThat they had been chosen by His Highness Felix, he had said proudly.\nBut now, that pride had been shattered by the cruel truth before them.\nCyril covered his face with both hands. Despite not being cold, his body was trembling.\n\"If that person is a criminal, then what… what was I? I was discovered by him, got carried away, thought I had become a proper person…\"\nBeneath his hands, his thin lips twisted into a bitter smile.\nIt was a servile, distorted smile, utterly unlike the usually haughty and proud Cyril Ashley.\n\"…I'm nothing but a court jester, am I not?\"\nFor a moment, Monica's mind went blank.\n\"That's not true!\"\nIt took her a second to realize that the strong denial had come from her own mouth.\nIt was a word that had burst forth before she could even think.\n\"No, no, no! That's not… true…!\"\nA strong impulse shook Monica's chest. This feeling must be… frustration.\nWith an almost childish sense of vexation welling up in her chest, Monica shouted,\n\"Lord Cyril, you're amazing! Unlike me, who only understands numbers, you know so much about so many things, you're great at teaching us our duties, you're always observant of those around you, confident and dignified… That's why… That's why…\"\nShe didn't even know what she was trying to say. This was just incoherent babbling.\nAnd yet, gripped by that impulse, Monica kept moving her mouth.\n\"…That's why… I don't like it when you speak badly of Lord Cyril, whom I respect…\"\nCyril was looking at Monica with an utterly dumbfounded expression.\nFeeling awkward, Monica hung her head. It was only now that she realized how childishly she had acted.\nCyril said nothing. When Monica glanced up at him, he quickly averted his gaze. Or was it just her imagination that his profile looked flushed?\nAs Cyril ruffled his bangs vigorously, he mumbled some indistinct words like \"Ah\" and \"Uh\" in his mouth, before letting out an awkward cough.\n\"…When I entered middle school, being the adopted son of a count, my status was low, and no one would speak to me.\"\nMonica had heard a little from Elliot about Cyril being adopted.\nBut this was the first time she had heard about Cyril's past from his own mouth.\n\"The one who spoke to me back then was that person… He said he chose me not because I was from a count's family, but because I was me. I was proud of that… That he acknowledged my own abilities.\"\nUnusually for the eloquent Cyril, he spoke in a rushed, mumbling voice.\nWhen Monica looked at him hesitantly, Cyril lowered the hands covering his face.\n\"That person saw past my title and chose me. And yet, I was overly disturbed by the change in his title… How shameful.\"\nHis long eyelashes, previously lowered, slowly rose. His clear blue eyes gazed straight ahead.\nJust like his usual self. Haughty and arrogant.\n\"Back then, I wanted to be of help to that person. I took the hand he extended to me of my own will. If that's the case, then I should not betray the resolve I had at that time.\"\nHis voice was firm, as if convincing himself, and belonged to the usual student council vice president, Cyril Ashley.\n\"Above all, I have been entrusted with something. To take care of the student council until my term ends… If that is what I have been asked, then I shall fulfill my duties as vice president.\"\nWhen Monica gave him a teary-eyed smile, remarking that he was back to his usual self, Cyril cleared his throat awkwardly.\n\"Ah, in other words… You saw, quite an unsightly side of me.\"\n\"…Well, you two put on quite the unsightly display for each other, isn't that right?\"\nCyril's shoulders shuddered.\nWhen Monica turned around, only the right half of Claudia's body was peeking out from the corner of the hallway.\nWhile Claudia was a beautiful lady, her appearance with only half her body revealed was almost eerie enough to wish she would just come out properly.\n\"…This hallway isn't that far from the student council room… When the door's open, your conversation leaks right through. Did you know that?\"\nCyril let out a strangled, \"Ugh.\" Monica pressed her cheeks with both hands and asked:\n\"D-D-Does that m-m-mean, my v-v-voice was…\"\nInstead of nodding, Claudia grinned wickedly. That smile said it all.\nApparently, even Monica's childish outbursts had been heard. Most likely by Elliot and the others as well.\n\"…It's a good thing today is a school holiday, isn't it?\"\nCyril and Monica both turned beet red to the tips of their ears.",

      "content": "Cyril returned to the student council room with a troubled look on his face, and Elliot welcomed Cyril and Monica with a sly grin. It seemed he had heard everything, causing Monica to hold her head while Cyril cleared his throat beside her.\n\"…I'm sorry for losing my composure.\"\n\"It's nothing new to see you losing your composure.\"\nAt Elliot's mocking words, Cyril made an unhappy face but swallowed his retort.\nIn the awkward atmosphere, while Monica fidgeted with her fingers, Neil, who had disappeared from the room at some point, suddenly reappeared. Apparently, he had gone to the staff room alone to assess the situation.\n\"Sorry, I'm back.\"\nWith Neil's return, the six current student council members and Claudia took their seats again. It was time to reset the situation.\n\"First, about this incident… The teachers don't seem to grasp the situation very well either. On top of that, we were told ‘to avoid unnecessary confusion, do not mention that the president was taken away.' Also, there will be a temporary school closure for three days after the break. They're probably going to investigate the academy.\"\n\"That makes sense,\" Elliot muttered.\n\"Regarding the handover to the new student council officers and the graduation ceremony, you should proceed as if the current student council president is absent. He's unlikely to return to the academy.\"\nAt Elliot's words, everyone's faces darkened.\nIt was an undeniable fact that the Second Prince was an imposter.\nExecution was inevitable, no matter what.\n\"…May I ask one thing?\"\nCyril spoke in a grave voice, looking at Elliot.\n\"If Secretary Howard's words are correct, the real prince died ten years ago and was replaced. However, the soldiers from the capital said that the imposter's true identity is the ‘Imperial Magician' who infiltrated during the chess tournament, and the replacement happened recently… This is a contradiction.\"\nIt was understandable for Cyril to be confused. Unlike Elliot or Bridget, who had already known about the replacement, or Claudia, who had suspected it, Cyril had just learned everything.\nHowever, Claudia, his younger stepsister, coldly told the perplexed Cyril,\n\"…Don't you get it yet? If you consider who's been pulling the strings behind this replacement, the answer becomes clear immediately.\"\nNext to the scowling Cyril, Neil clapped his hands and said, \"Ah, I see.\"\n\"The replacement ten years ago was orchestrated by Duke Crockford, right? So the Duke knows everything. If for some reason the Duke decides to abandon the president… Pinning it on the Empire would be convenient in various ways.\"\n\"…As expected of you, Neil.\"\nClaudia gave Neil a rare, gentle smile, an expression rather out of place in this grave situation, but Claudia was unlikely to care about such things.\n\"…Duke Crockford is a war hawk. To put it bluntly, he wants war with the Empire… The ‘Imperial agent killed and replaced the Second Prince' would be a perfect pretext for war.\"\n\"But in exchange, the Duke would lose a major piece which is the Second Prince,\" Cyril argued.\nClaudia's gentle smile vanished, replaced by her usual expressionless demeanor. \"…That's what the Third Prince is for. I'll bet on it. Soon, Duke Crockford will announce the enthronement of the Third Prince.\"\nWhat Claudia said largely aligned with Monica's deductions.\nMonica was deeply worried.\nAt this rate, Ike's existence will become the reason for the war…\nAccording to the Duke's scenario, the real Second Prince was killed by an Imperial Magician. If the citizens accepted this as the truth… it would be more than enough reason for war.\nHowever, in the current situation, there was nothing Monica and the others could do. Everyone present felt the same way.\nAn awkward silence filled the room until Neil raised his hand uneasily and said, \"Um…\"\n\"I was just thinking… Isn't it possible that during the interrogation, the president might reveal the whole truth? Like, that the Imperial Magician was uninvolved.\"\nCertainly, if Isaac confessed everything during the interrogation, he could accuse Duke Crockford's involvement, regardless of whether he would be believed.\nHowever, in response to Neil's point, Elliot firmly asserted, \"That won't happen.\"\n\"For that servant, the most important thing is ‘the honor of the real Prince Felix.' If he reveals everything here, he can't preserve the prince's honor. In that case, he would choose to die as the criminal who killed the heroic prince.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThe discussion in the student council room ultimately ended up merely confirming the current situation.\nNo one mentioned what to do from here——everyone understood.\nRegardless of the reason, what Isaac Walker did was unforgivable.\nAnd no one could shield Duke Crockford…\nAs Monica walked back to the dorms, taking a detour alone, she pondered.\nWhat should I do…?\nAt this rate, Duke Crockford would propose war under the pretext that \"an Imperial agent killed the Second Prince.\"\nIf the Second Prince, who had been hailed as a hero until now, was said to have been killed, the outrage of the citizens would be immeasurable. Those supporting the war hawks would explosively increase.\nI have to prevent that, no matter what…\n\"Quite a dire situation, indeed.\"\nAt the calm voice from ahead, Monica looked up to see a black-haired girl in the academy uniform. With an intellectual face and slightly thick eyebrows… it was the Imperial spy, Heidi.\n\"I've gathered as much information as I could on my end as well. There's a record of the fake prince and the Jewelled Magician Emmanuel Darwin dining together not long ago. Most likely, the fake prince and the Jewelled Mage were conspiring to rebel against Duke Crockford. However, the Jewelled Mage Emmanuel Darwin failed and was killed.\"\nAnd Duke Crockford used his death.\nHeidi calmly informed the stony-faced Monica:\n\"At this rate, the Ridill Kingdom and my Empire will go to war. If that happens, you…\"\nThat's right. Monica had made a promise to the Black Lion Emperor.\nIf the Empire and the Ridill Kingdom went to war, Monica would end the war by her own hand.\n…By offering the head of a Ridill royal to the Emperor.\n\"Please, wait. Just a little more… a little more time…\"\n\"The limit is the fake prince's execution. Once the accomplice who knows everything is dead, the truth will forever remain shrouded in darkness.\"\nAs long as Isaac doesn't reveal the truth, no one can stop Duke Crockford.\nAt this rate, war is inevitable.\nI have to do something…\nBut she couldn't think of any solution.\nEven with some authority as one of the Seven Sages, it would be difficult for Monica alone to turn this situation around.\nAs Monica fell silent, Heidi handed her a small folded paper.\n\"And here are the investigation results you requested.\"\n\"…!\"\nOpening the paper, it contained the name of a \"certain person\" and a location.\nAs Monica was secretly surprised by the location, Heidi frowned her thick eyebrows.\n\"While contacting that person may not improve the situation…\"\n\"Or it may turn out to be a waste of time.\"\nThis \"certain person\" was unlikely to have information capable of turning the situation around.\nAnd yet, Monica desperately wanted to know about Ike. And the real Prince Felix.\nThe person named in Heidi's memo was one of the few who knew about Aik… and the real Prince Felix.\nStill, she didn't expect that person would be there…\nConnections between people sometimes take unexpected turns.\nThe \"certain person\" Monica was seeking was taking refuge at Richardwood Monastery in the northern part of the Ridill Kingdom.\nThe same monastery where Casey Groove, the girl who had once plotted to assassinate the Second Prince, had been sent.",

      "content": "The Sheffield Holiday passed as the wind spirit Sheffield carried the spring breeze, the Ridill Kingdom turned refreshingly springlike, and the forests were dyed in the color of fresh greenery. However, in the northern regions of the Ridill Kingdom, the snowy shadows still linger on Mount Verandge.\nAlong that mountain path still tinged with the chill of winter walked a young nun bundled up in a thick coat. She could only be called a nun because she wore a nun's hood. Aside from that, her appearance was far from nunlike.\nWhat this \"nun\" had was a woven basket on her back and gripped a crossbow in her hand.\nCrunching through the frosted earth, the nun squatted down, checking for animal tracks while plucking and tossing fresh mountain vegetables into her basket with deft, fluid motions that betrayed an efficient, wasteless manner.\nToday it's just mountain vegetables again. I'd love to have some meat on the table too, but…\nWhile some churches forbid clergy from hunting or eating meat, the spirit deity this nun served did not prohibit such acts. In fact, it was quite fond of hunting and was revered as a hunting deity in some regions.\nMore importantly, in the barren northern lands where food was scarce, meat from hunting was a precious source of nourishment.\nSince the monastery where she lived housed mostly elderly women, this young nun was primarily responsible for procuring food. She would go down to town for shopping about twice a month, but fresh meat was seldom available.\nAs she swallowed her saliva, wistfully imagining the taste of fatty meat again, her ears caught the faint sound of approaching footsteps.\nHmm, the direction suggests the creature is upwind of her, but why is it coming this way?\nPuzzled yet readying her crossbow, the nun's eyes widened at the figure emerging from the trees' shadows.\n\"Hiieeee! W-w-wait, I, I, I won't sh-shoot, jus-…\"\nTrembling before her was a petite girl clutching a black cat.\nThe nun——Casey Groove—recognized this girl.\nIt was Monica Everett, the Silent Witch, one of the Seven Sages who sat at the pinnacle among the magicians in the Ridill Kingdom.\n\"…Monica?\"\nAs Casey lowered her crossbow and spoke Monica's name, Monica weakly smiled back, looking rather helpless.\n\"Long time no see, Casey.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"Watch your step there, it's slippery.\"\n\"O-Okay, waaah…\"\nCasey hurriedly grabbed Monica's arm as she almost slipped after being warned.\n\"You okay?\"\n\"Y-yes… th-thank you.\"\nAfter Monica's awkward thanks, Casey scratched her cheek self-consciously and continued walking ahead.\nHow many months had it been since she last spoke to Monica?\nCasey probably no longer considered Monica a friend, but Monica still thought of Casey as one.\nStill, if Monica acted too friendly here, she would likely just make Casey uncomfortable. Casey was kind, so she wouldn't show displeasure outright, but still…\nThe two walked in awkward silence until they reached an aged monastery——Casey's current residence.\nThe cat Nero in Monica's arms mewled, sounding chilly.\nIt was none other than Nero who had transported Monica here. Monica could not use flight magic, and humans generally lacked the magical power for extended flight anyway.\nHowever, traveling by carriage to this remote monastery would have taken far too long.\nSo Monica had ridden on Nero's back as he took his true black dragon form, flying her here.\nSoaring through the skies atop a dragon——it was the stuff of storybooks, Monica had thought.\nHer inquisitive friend Glenn would surely be envious, but Monica's sole impression was: \"It was high, cold, and scary.\"\nThe northern Ridill regions still bore the lingering chill of winter, and Nero, who disliked the cold, had shifted into his cat form and snuggled into Monica's clothes as soon as they arrived.\n\"Is that cat your familiar?\" Casey asked, turning to Monica.\n\"…Yeah, something like that…but can he come into the monastery…?\"\nNero mewled indignantly in Monica's arms as if protesting—\n——After braving that cold flight, you'd cast me out?!\nCasey paused before the monastery doors, studying Nero intently.\nCasey had encountered the human-formed Nero during the assassination attempt incident.\nMonica's heart raced, wondering if Nero's true identity had been discovered. However, Casey's expression softened as she stroked Nero's head, remarking, \"How cute.\"\n\"Is he well-behaved?\"\n\"Y-yes, very well-behaved…right?\"\nA blatant lie.\nTo clarify, Nero was the same black dragon who had once brought terror and chaos to the Ridill Kingdom. Yet he mewled adorably with an expression of innocence that would make one doubt the pride of the dragon race.\n\"If you're holding him, I don't see why he can't come inside,\" said Casey, opening the door.\nInside the cozy chapel, an elderly nun with round glasses and a rather stern air was cleaning. Her hood differed from Casey's, likely indicating a higher rank.\n\"Sister Rona. We have a visitor,\" Casey whispered to Monica as she led her inside. \"She's the one in charge here.\"\nMonica straightened her posture and greeted the stern-faced woman. \"A pl-pleasure to meet you…\"\n\"Welcome, visitor. To come all this way to pray at our humble, remote monastery—you must be truly devout.\"\nThere was a chilly, dismissive quality to Sister Rona's tone that suggested Monica's presence was unwelcome. This isolated monastery did serve as a haven for those with troubled pasts, so outsiders were naturally regarded with caution.\nSensing the scrutiny, Monica swallowed hard before explaining her purpose with a trembling voice.\n\"I-I came to meet someone…who I heard is staying at this monastery.\"\n\"And this person's name?\"\nStiffening under Sister Rona's probing gaze, Monica answered hesitantly.\n\"…Marcy Abbott.\"\nMarcy Abbott——that was the name of the former head maid who had served at the Clockford Duchy.\nDuring the infiltration of the Clockford Duchy alongside the Thorn Witch Raul Roseburg, the gardener had mentioned that the young Second Prince was fond of his attendant Isaac and the head maid Marcy.\nSo Monica thought that meeting Marcy might provide insights into the young Felix and Isaac.\nHowever, when Monica asked Heidi to investigate Marcy's whereabouts, a surprising revelation surfaced.\nShortly after the real Felix's death, Marcy had quit the duchy and gone missing.\nIt seemed she had relied on relatives to secure passage to this remote monastery and lay low.\nWhat was Marcy hiding from, going to such lengths?\nLikely, she had uncovered an inconvenient truth regarding Duke Crockford… the fact that the Second Prince had been replaced by Isaac Walker.\n\"May I meet with Marcy Abbott?\"\n\"I cannot allow that.\"\nSister Rona's refusal was curt and firm.\nAs Monica tried to protest, Sister Rona raised a hand to silence her.\n\"Because Sister Marcy passed away from pneumonia a year ago.\"\nAh… Monica let out a heavy sigh.\nThe loss of one of the few who knew Isaac was a genuine blow.\n\"Are you related to Sister Marcy by blood?\"\nMonica shook her head at Sister Rona's query. \"…No.\"\nShe had only heard about the head maid Marcy secondhand and knew little about the woman herself.\nAs Monica hesitated, unsure how to proceed, Sister Rona gestured to a chapel pew.\n\"Please, have a seat.\"\nAfter Monica hesitantly took a seat, Casey swiftly lifted Nero from Monica's arms.\n\"May I play with this little one?\"\n\"Y-yeah…\"\nWith Monica's nod of approval, Casey said \"Thank you\" and carried Nero out of the chapel. She likely realized this was a conversation Monica shouldn't be overheard, and tactfully excused herself with Nero.\nEven this cozy little chapel felt unusually spacious with just Sister Rona and Monica present.\nSister Rona silently regarded Monica, as if awaiting confession. Her serene face encompassed the gentle understanding and firmness characteristic of the clergy… a gentleness to accept any story, yet sternness to tolerate no lies.\nMonica struggled to give shape to the words she could not properly organize herself.\n\"Someone I… know is in a difficult situation.\"\n——Someone I know.\nSaying it out loud, Monica was struck by how superficial it sounded. And yet, she did not know how else to define Isaac's existence to her.\nTo Isaac, Monica was a nightlife friend.\nTo him in the Academy, Monica was a junior in the student council.\nAnd to him, the Silent Witch was an admired great magician.\nBut if asked what ‘he' was to her, Monica could not express it well.\n\"That person… is obsessed with something, and I could not understand why that person went to such lengths.\"\n\"But you wish to understand, don't you?\"\n\"…Yes.\"\nThat's right. Monica wanted to understand Isaac at least a little. That's why she had come all this way to these northern lands.\n\"Marcy was one of the few who knew about that person… I wanted to meet her and hear what she had to say.\"\nMonica had thought that by hearing about Isaac and the late Prince Felix from Marcy, she may be able to understand Isaac's obsession.\n…But it had been for naught.\nSeeing Monica's dejection, Sister Rona asked, \"Since this person is in a difficult situation, do you wish to help that person?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nThe word came out surprisingly smoothly.\nYes, Monica wanted to help that person… despite being consumed by an obsession, he still had a childlike side that made his eyes light up over magic and the Silent Witch.\nEven now, Monica could not define how she felt about Felix. Lana was a friend. Cyril was a respected senior. But Isaac? When asked, Monica could not find the answer.\nWhen they first met, he had picked up a nut for her.\nHe had forcibly recruited her into the student council, always teasing her.\nIn the red light district, he said they were nightlife friends and gifted her a book and necklace.\nWhen meeting her as the Silent Witch, he regarded her with admiration.\nEven if his actions were unforgivable. Even if he was deeply involved in her father's death.\nStill, Monica could not hate him. She found herself wanting to see him again——him with that boyish sparkle in his eyes over his love for magic.\n\"I want to help that person. That's why I want to know more about them.\"\nAs if convincing herself, as the words spilled out, the sternness seemed to leave Sister Rona's expression as she watched Monica.\n\"And what is this person's name?\"\n\"Isaac… Isaac Walker.\"\nUpon hearing that name from Monica, Sister Rona fell into contemplative silence. Then, \"Please wait a moment,\" she said, leaving the chapel.\nI wonder what that's about…\nAs Monica pondered curiously, Sister Rona soon returned, cradling a small cloth bundle with care.\n\"Here, take this.\"\nHanding the bundle to the puzzled Monica, Sister Rona's face held a hint of nostalgic reflection as she explained:\n\"This is one of Sister Marcy's belongings left behind. On her deathbed, she said, ‘If someone named Isaac Walker ever comes seeking me, please give this to him.'\"\n\"…Are you sure… to entrust this item to me?\"\nSister Rona cast her eyes down, her expression betraying a human struggle.\n\"From your manner, it seems unlikely for Mr. Walker to visit here himself. So I will take it upon myself to entrust this to you instead.\"\nGently caressing the cloth bundle, Sister Rona continued in a mournful, caring tone.\n\"Sister Marcy lived in constant fear and regret. Until her last breath, she seemed tormented, endlessly apologizing to someone…By giving this to you, I hope she may finally rest peacefully in the Goddess's embrace.\"\nWith a nod, Monica carefully unwrapped the bundle to reveal… a diary. The first page contained a sealed envelope.\nThough aged, the ornate binding and gilded accents suggested this was no cheap journal.\nWas this Marcy's diary? Turning to the page with the envelope, Monica's eyes widened.\nFor the handwriting scrawled there was childishly crude——it was the diary of the late, true Second Prince Felix Ark Ridill himself.",

      "content": "Special thanks to Androqlezz and Big Red Doge for the donations. Thank you so much!! 🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️\nHere's a bonus chapter.\nA letter was tucked into Felix Ark Ridill's diary. It seemed to be written by Marcy Abbott on her deathbed.\nScrawled there in a shaky hand, it said,\n\"These past few days, my cough has worsened daily, to the point where even getting up has become difficult. My life cannot last much longer. So before I breathe my last, I wish to record here the sins I committed, my regrets, all of it. I pray that whoever is reading this letter, is not the Duke of Crockford, but young Master Isaac.\nI can still vividly recall the night His Highness passed away. That evening, at His request, I stood guard at the servants' entrance so he could view the stars outside.\nIt was a cloudy day, yet why did His Highness insist so stubbornly on watching the stars outdoors…? Whether I realized it or not, I should have stopped His Highness. Yet I merely indulged his adorable, childish wish.\nLater, when I heard His Highness had fallen from the roof, my blood ran cold. I do not know why His Highness, who had gone out to see the stars, ended up on the roof. But I was utterly convinced it had to do with me letting him outside.\nI was utterly terrified. What if His Highness fell from the roof because of me? If the Duke found out, what punishment would I face…?\nUnable to bear the terror, I committed a sin.\nHis Highness always kept a meticulous diary. Perhaps he had written about asking me to stand guard. If anyone saw that… Fearing this, I secretly took His Highness' diary.\nOnce in my room, upon reading the diary, I learned a dreadful truth.\nKnowing this truth, there was no way I could continue working at the Duke's estate. I was bound to betray my distress. The Duke would see through me.\nSo out of self-preservation, I fled the Duke's estate.\nUsing a relative's connections to hide, I finally caught my breath after fleeing to the far north. Rereading His Highness' diary, I was overcome with regret.\nThe diary's last pages were addressed to young Isaac… Yet to save myself, I had taken this diary.\nI knew I had to show this diary to young Isaac, return it to him… But I lacked the courage. I was too afraid of the Duke finding me.\nOh God. I wish, I wish… that this diary could reach young Isaac. That kind, poor child… Grant him solace…\"\nThe handwriting was terribly shaky and difficult to read. Whether it was from the severity of her illness or being tormented by past events, Monica could not tell. Monica returned the letter to the envelope and flipped through Felix's diary.\n\"Grandfather scolded me again today. Because I cannot ride horses well. I'm scared of riding and bad at it.\"\n\"Grandfather scolded me again today. For doing poorly on a test. The teacher was disappointed too. I have to try, try harder.\"\n\"Grandfather scolded me again today. Because I could not properly greet a guest. I get so nervous in front of people that I lose my voice. Why can I never meet Grandfather's expectations?\"\nMost of the diary entries began the same way.\n——\n\"Grandfather scolded me again today.\"\nFollowed by a litany of his shortcomings, matching the timid prince Bridget had described.\nBut the diary featured another figure nearly as frequently as \"Grandfather\"——his beloved servant Isaac.\n\"Isaac made me a rabbit doll from a handkerchief. When I said I wanted to make one too, he taught me how to make the simplest flower. I can't make them as well as Isaac yet, but if I practice, will I be able to make prettier ones?\"\n\"I rode a horse for the first time! When Isaac holds the reins, even horses are amazingly tame. It's like magic. Isaac is amazing.\"\n\"I had a fever again. Spending the whole day in bed was boring, but Isaac told me all sorts of stories so I wasn't bored. Isaac knows so much.\"\nThe days he wrote about Isaac had a livelier quality to the writing. More notably, those entries often included sketches of flowers or horses alongside the text——quite endearing.\n\"I made my first friend. My friend's name is Ike. A secret friend, only for when we're alone together. Ike calls me Ark. Ike and Ark. Just having our names rhyme makes me happy somehow.\"\nFrom this day on, the name \"Ike\" appeared frequently in the diary.\nFelix clearly differentiated between calling Isaac by his proper name and the nickname Ike when they were friends, almost giving the impression there were two separate people.\nAs one read further in the diary, an image of the young Felix emerged.\nTimid, lacking confidence… despite being royalty, just an ordinary young boy. His timid nature made Monica, being rather shy herself, feel a sense of familiarity.\nTowards the latter half of the diary, an entire page was devoted to a drawing. It was clearly a conscientious effort by the prince to depict his ideal self.\nBeside the drawing, he had written:\n[The Ideal Prince]\n• Intelligent (can understand complex political matters)\n• Brave\n• Kind to everyone\n• Skilled with swords and horses\n• Skilled at hunting\n• Can use lots of magic\n• Can greet people confidently (without stumbling over words)\n• A strong chess player (better than Elliot)\n• Can skillfully praise ladies (without upsetting Bridget)\n• Skilled at dancing (can lead well, won't step on partner's feet)\n• Can do all sorts of things like Ike\nAnd a little encircled flower symbol was marked next to \"Kind to everyone.\"\n… Perhaps he really was the gentle prince that Bridget and Elliot described.\nAs Monica turned the page while pondering this, her eyes went wide.\nThe diary abruptly ended on the very next page.\n\"How can Grandfather was considering something truly horrific. Using Isaac… as my body double. Altering his face, giving him the same scars as me, even abandoning his name. Having Isaac take my place at all official functions.\nGrandfather said I am no longer needed.\nIsaac knew everything and stayed by my side.\nWhat should I do? My head is spinning.\"\nThe words were blotted in places, the paper wrinkled… surely from fallen tears.\nThe Duke of Crockford had outright told Felix he no longer needed him.\nFor the young boy who had cried and tried so hard just to be praised, and acknowledged by his grandfather, those words must have been utter despair.\nWhen he learned his kind attendant was to become his body double, how devastated he must have felt.\nYet the gentle prince harbored no resentment toward anyone, even in his sadness and despair.\n\"I want to free Isaac——Ike.\nIke is so capable, he could have become anything. But because I was so dependent on him, I ended up binding him to this estate. Making him take on this painful role.\nIf this continues, Ike will truly lose his freedom.\nBefore that happens, I… I'm going to defy Grandfather.\nIf I explain it to Ike verbally, kind Ike will surely try to dissuade me.\nSo I'll leave my parting words in a letter, or else my resolve may waver.\nI hope Ike can gain his freedom and find his own path in life.\nAnd…\"\nUpon reading the final line, Monica's eyes went wide.\nHuh? But Elliot said Ike was…\nTo Monica, the diary seemed to contradict what Elliot had said about Ike.\nShe reread the final passage over and over, then realized,\n——Ike had misunderstood something.\nHer heart pounded, blood rushing faster than usual through her veins. Welling up from her depths was an intense, resolute impulse.\nI have to show Ike this diary…\nWithin Monica, the desire to help Ike transformed.\n…Into a determination to help Ike, no matter what.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nCarried by Casey to an empty room, Nero was very satisfied with her treatment of him.\nFirst of all, her way of holding him was stable, and her technique for stroking his fur was skillful.\nSome human children tend to grip tails too tightly or stroke fur the wrong way, but Kaycie stroked along the grain, gently and thoroughly. It felt wonderful.\nThis woman's a technician, all right…\nAs Nero purred and trilled contentedly, Casey even prepared boiled preserved meat with the salt removed to make it easier to eat. Of course, she didn't forget to let it cool to avoid burns and shredded it for easier consumption.\nTruly someone who understood how to treat a cat, thought the Black Dragon Wogan, Nero, who had once swallowed a live bird whole. For the record, Nero enjoyed both heavily salted meat and completely raw ingredients equally.\nAs Nero ate, Casey muttered wistfully, \"…Hey, did Monica say anything about me?\"\nNero paused eating to let out a meowing sound, prompting Casey to laugh awkwardly, \"Ahaha, of course, a cat wouldn't understand.\"\nNero knew Casey had been friends with Monica back at Serendia Academy.\nHe also knew Casey had told Monica \"I'm not your friend\" when they parted ways after the attempted assassination incident.\nHumans really are such tiresome creatures.\nNero could not comprehend the human tendency to let positions or titles get in the way of expressing goodwill toward someone they felt positively about.\nAfter all, Nero knew that Casey had gifted Monica an embroidered handkerchief she made herself. And that Monica had been overjoyed by it.\nEven today, Monica kept worrying on Nero's back as they flew, wondering how she would handle it if Casey treated her coldly.\nNero was tempted to point out that Monica seemed concerned only with Casey, to the point of nearly forgetting her original purpose for coming.\nHowever, for now, Nero could only play the role of an adorable black cat. Revealing all that would be out of character.\n\"Um, sorry to keep you… waiting…\"\nThere was a knock at the door as Monica peeked in. It seemed her errand was finished.\nSeeing Nero eating the meat, Monica's eyes went a bit wide. \"You got a meal? Ah, Casey… thank you.\"\n\"Don't worry about it. Do you want some too, Monica? It's just simple rations, but…\"\n\"No, I have to hurry back, so…\"\n\"…I see.\"\nAn awkward silence fell between the two.\nAs the sensible familiar that he was, Nero decided to take matters into his own paws.\nNero leaped towards Monica and deftly pulled an item from her pocket with his front paws. A handkerchief with a floral embroidery pattern dropped to the floor.\n\"Wha-, ah, umm…\"\nMonica hurriedly picked up the handkerchief, her gaze darting back and forth.\nCasey stared at the handkerchief as well, her lips pressed into an awkward line.\nC'mon, say something, just say it… Nero batted at Monica's rear with his paws, urging her on.\nAfter an \"auu auu\" struggle, Monica seemed to steel her resolve and forced out the words,\n\"Th-Thank you for the handkerchief!\"\nCasey was momentarily dumbstruck before letting out a laugh, her shoulders shaking.\n\"You still stutter when you get nervous, I see.\"\n\"Auu…\"\nMonica fidgeted, twisting her fingers shyly as she smiled back.\n\"You know, before I leave… there's something I want to tell you, Kaycie.\"\n\"Well, I may only be a novitiate nun now, but it's still a sister's duty to listen to a wayward lamb's troubles.\"\nHer reassuring older sister-like smile was the same as back at the academy when she looked at Monica.\nLooking relieved, Monica took a deep breath before speaking.\n\"You see, I… might end up doing something that others would see as wrong.\"\nAs a dragon, Nero had difficulty comprehending human concepts of \"right\" and \"wrong\" behavior. To him, all actions were simply a matter of \"doing what is necessary\" rather than judging them as right or wrong.\nHowever, humans constantly grappled with their own sense of righteousness, tormented by conflicting notions of what constituted correct conduct. It was such a conflict that had previously turned Monica and Casey into adversaries.\n\"What I'm going to do will definitely be seen as wrong by everyone, I think.\"\nYet Monica declared this to Casey, her former adversary,\n\"But I promise. I absolutely will not allow war to come to this country.\"\nListening calmly to Monica's confession and resolve, Casey responded with a fearless smile.\n\"I, Sister Casey, give you her blessing. Do as you see fit… If it's something you've decided of your own will, Monica, then see it through to the end.\"\nWith a small smile, Monica nodded at the powerful words of the sister.",

      "content": "When the sage Emanuel Darwin, the Jewelled Mage of the Seven Sages of the Kingdom of Riddill, died, an emergency summons was issued to the remaining six sages. However, it took nearly three days for all of them to gather.\nThe last to arrive at the Jade Room, where only the Seven Sages and the king were permitted entry, was Bradford Firestone, the Artillery Magician who had been out on a dragon-slaying expedition.\nHaving just returned from slaying the dragon, Bradford's beard was thicker than usual, and he simply wore his Seven Sages robe over his travel attire, looking rather unkempt. Nevertheless, there was no sign of fatigue on his rugged face.\nRather, the five who had arrived earlier looked much gloomier. Only the Thorn Witch, nonchalantly munching on vegetables as usual, remained unchanged.\n\"Well, well, you all look pretty gloomy. It's normal for Abyss to be gloomy, but you, the Barrier… it's rare to see you looking so haggard.\"\nAs Bradford pointed out, the one who looked the most fatigued and haggard, surprisingly, was Louis Miller, the Barrier Magician.\nHis long chestnut hair had lost its luster and was hastily tied back instead of his usual triple braid. Furthermore, he had prominent dark circles under his eyes, making his exhaustion evident to all.\n\"I thought you, who disliked the Jewelled so much, would be laughing and tipping back some wine… Turns out you have a heart after all.\"\n\"I'm sorry for disappointing you, but my condition is due to the fatigue of childcare.\"\n\"……\"\n\"For some reason, my daughter won't sleep when I try to put her to bed.\"\nBradford gave an inscrutable \"I-I see\" nod and turned his gaze towards Monica.\n\"You look pretty pale too, Young Silent Girl. Did you have breakfast?\"\n\"Y-yes… I'm fine.\"\nMonica's pallor was due to her near-constant activity with hardly any rest.\nAfter hearing Heidi's information about Marcy's whereabouts, Monica immediately rode Nero to the northern monastery and returned to Serendia Academy.\nAlthough Monica rode on Nero's back, riding a dragon is not as comfortable as Lynn's flight magic. It was cold, and terrifying to be at risk of falling off, and there was the constant threat of colliding with birds head-on, leaving her unable to relax for even a moment.\nTherefore, whenever Monica rode Nero, she had to tie herself to the protrusions on his back with ropes and maintain a thin defensive barrier at all times.\nAfter returning to the academy dormitory, utterly exhausted, she was then abducted by Lynn and brought to the castle. At this point, Monica was on the verge of depleting her magical power and physical strength.\nBeside her, the Thorn Witch Raul Roseburg took a carrot from his pocket and offered it to her, but Monica politely declined. Her nerves were not as sturdy as to munch on a carrot just before a meeting began.\nRaul remained nonchalant as ever, and the Abyss Shaman Ray Albright was also emanating his usual gloomy aura.\nAmidst this, the eldest, Mary Harvey, the Star Oracle Witch, opened her mouth.\n\"Well then, since everyone's here, let's begin the meeting… although there's hardly anything we can do at this point.\"\nThe Jewelled Mage Emanuel Darwin had conspired with the imperial magicians to overthrow the nation.\nSpecifically, he had assisted the Imperial Magician in murdering the Second Prince and replacing him.\nIf this explanation were to be accepted as is, Ike would be executed as the Imperial Magician impersonating the Second Prince. At worst, it could even lead to war with the empire.\nTherefore, Monica desperately spoke up.\n\"U-Um…\"\nAll attention was suddenly drawn to Monica, who rarely spoke up during normal meetings.\nHere, she had to skillfully persuade the other sages not to execute Ike, lest the situation spiral out of control. Monica steeled her resolve.\n\"I… I don't think… Lord Jewelled Magician… would do such a thing.\"\n\"Well, you might have a point,\" Louis readily agreed with Monica. Leaning on the desk, twirling a stray strand of his disheveled hair around his finger, Louis said, \"It's as Miss Silent Witch says, there's no way that timid man could betray Duke Crockford. Let alone that disgusting old geezer committing suicide out of guilt——it's simply laughable. He's the kind of man who would kick others down and lick someone's shoes just to survive.\"\nBradford gave Louis a puzzled look in response to his harsh words.\n\"So, Barrier, you think the Jewelled was killed by someone?\"\n\"Nine times out of ten, that's the case.\"\nIf things continued in this direction, Monica might be able to win Louis over and prevent Ike's execution.\nJust as Monica harbored that small hope, Louis muttered coldly,\n\"However, it would be pointless for us to discuss this matter.\"\nConfused by Louis's dispassionate words, Monica involuntarily raised her voice.\n\"Wh-Why… would it be pointless?\"\n\"Because it's more convenient for everyone to accept the story that ‘The Jewelled Mage betrayed the nation and conspired with the Imperial Magician to kill the Second Prince.'\"\nNot understanding the meaning of Louis's words, Monica was perplexed.\nMary gazed at Monica with a slightly sympathetic look in her eyes.\n\"If it turns out that Young Emanuel was murdered rather than committing suicide, and that someone had set him up, who do you think would be suspected?\"\nMary's words prompted Bradford to nod in agreement while folding his arms.\n\"Well, the First Prince's faction would be the prime suspects, wouldn't they?\"\nAs Bradford said this with a sly grin towards Louis, Louis snorted in response.\nFinally, Monica understood.\nThat's right… Lord Jewelled Magician belonged to the Second Prince's faction… If Lord Jewelled Magician was revealed to have been murdered, the first suspects would be… not the empire, but the people from the First Prince's faction!\nIn this case, the apparent victim was Duke Crockford, whose grandson, the Second Prince, was killed.\nWhat greater blow could there be to the Second Prince's faction than having their supported prince murdered?\nIn such a situation, no one would likely realize that the true mastermind was Duke Crockford himself. People would then wonder who the real culprit was.\nFor the First Prince's faction, it would be undesirable to have suspicion cast upon them. In that case, it would be better if the Empire were the culprit.\nFor the Second Prince's faction, whether the culprit is from the First Prince's faction or the empire, either would be convenient.\nAnd for the Third Prince's faction as well, whether the culprit is from the First Prince's faction or the empire, it would provide an opportunity to enthrone the Third Prince, so there's no loss either way.\nIn the end, for anyone in the Kingdom of Ridill, the most convenient explanation would be \"the culprit is an imperial agent.\"\nAs Monica turned pale, Louis told her, \"Ultimately, the most unproblematic conclusion is to say ‘The Jewelled Mage betrayed us and conspired with the empire.'\"\n\"B-But, just because it's convenient, for everyone, to make such a… forceful…\"\nAs Monica desperately tried to argue, Louis gave her a cold look. Today, with his lack of sleep causing dark circles, his intimidating presence was more intense than usual.\n\"You're being unusually chatty today, colleague?\"\n\"……\"\nLouis belonged to the First Prince's faction. Therefore, in this case, it would be more convenient for him to go along with blaming the Empire rather than carelessly intervening and having suspicion cast on the First Prince's faction.\nRealizing that she had no allies in this room, Monica was told with a thin smile by Louis,\n\"Let me teach you one good lesson… ‘In politics, the facts do not necessarily become the truth. What is convenient for the powerful often becomes the truth.'\"\nHis smile, accentuated by his sleep-deprived fatigue from childcare, seemed to ask, \"Isn't this a valuable lesson?\"\nMonica had the trump card of Felix Prince's real diary. If she showed this to Louis, would he cooperate with her?\n…No, if Louis finds out the truth about the prince's replacement and gets his hands on that decisive evidence… he'll make all of it public. To thoroughly destroy Duke Crockford.\nIf Duke Crockford's actions were fully exposed, his execution would be certain.\nThat would certainly prevent a war. More importantly, it would allow Monica to avenge her father's resentment.\nThis would undoubtedly be the \"right\" way to do things.\n——Finally, Ike would be executed, without ever knowing Felix Prince's true wish.\nThen, then…\nEventually, as the meeting ended and people started leaving one by one, Monica called out to Mary Harvey, the Star Oracle Witch, after confirming Louis's departure.\nWhat Monica was about to do could never be known by Louis, no matter what.\n\"Lady Star Oracle Witch… I want to ask a favor…\"\n\"Oh, what is it?\"\nMary tilted her head demurely and looked at Monica with her very pale blue eyes.\nTo what extent could those eyes see the truth? As the nation's foremost prophet, could she see through even Monica's actions?\nRegardless, this was Monica's biggest gamble in her life.\nTo prevent war and save Ike's life…\n\"Could you… let me meet with him…\"",

      "content": "The criminal Isaac who killed the Second Prince, used flesh manipulation magic to copy his face and swap places with him… is currently in a room of the so-called prison tower within the grounds of Ridill Kingdom's castle.\nThe prison tower was used to imprison noble prisoners of war in times of war, but for the past few decades, it has mainly been used for imprisoned nobles and royals.\nAlthough Isaac is considered an impostor who pretended to be the prince, since he has not been sentenced yet, he seems to be receiving treatment befitting royalty.\nThe room is quite clean with basic amenities, and even has luxurious furniture like in a noble's mansion.\nExcept for the iron bars on the windows and the iron door with multiple locks, it could be called a comfortable room.\nIsaac himself is also wearing a bracelet-like charm that seals his magic spell and resistance, but he is not chained up. He can move freely inside the room and is properly served three meals a day.\nAt noon, the gap under the iron door opens slightly and a meal tray is slid in. The meal consists of bread, a vegetable-rich soup, and even fruit.\nIsaac licked a bit of the soup with his tongue. There was no unnatural bitterness or numbness, so the food didn't seem to be poisoned.\nWell, of course…\nDuke Crockford knows Isaac will never tell the truth. So he wouldn't make the risky move of poisoning a prisoner's food.\nAs Isaac was tearing off pieces of bread and putting them in his mouth, he heard a cat's meow from the window. Looking over, there was a black cat sitting on the other side of the iron grating.\nThis floor should be about four or five stories high for a normal building. How did it climb up here?\nAs he was puzzled by this, the black cat raised one paw as if greeting a close friend.\n\"It seems prisoners get pretty good treatment, huh?\"\nThe words Isaac heard came unmistakably from the black cat's mouth——human speech. Startled, Isaac dropped the bread, and the black cat grinned slyly.\n\"Yo, Prince. You seem in a hell of a pinch.\"\nThat tone and those mischievous golden eyes were familiar.\n\"…Good day, Mr. Bartholomew Alexander.\"\nWhen Isaac said that, the black cat let out a rumbling cat-like laugh.\n\"Not bad, calling my name properly even though you know who I really am. I don't dislike that obedience.\"\n\"It's quite a cute form you have today.\"\n\"Heh, ain't I cute? Feel free to praise me more. Meow.\"\nAs the black dragon meowed, Isaac smiled ambiguously and approached the window.\nThe window grating formed a crisscross pattern with narrow gaps that even the black cat's body would have difficulty squeezing through.\n\"Are you here on Lady Everett's orders, I wonder?\"\nDid the Silent Witch care about him even a little? Or perhaps…\n\"Did Lady Everett become disappointed in me?\"\nIsaac understood the weight of the crime he committed and was prepared to be condemned by others.\nStill, the thought of being disappointed by the woman he respected made his chest ache a little.\nSeeing Isaac's expression darken slightly, the black cat snorted.\n\"Don't worry. My master won't feel disappointed in other people. Since she doesn't expect anything from them in the first place.\"\n\"……\"\n\"Ah, but maybe that's changed a bit recently? …No, never mind. Just talking to myself.\"\nThe black cat nodded and twitched its whiskers as it looked up at Isaac.\n\"Hey, Sparkly Prince.\"\n\"I'm not a prince anymore.\"\n\"Then Sparkly.\"\n\"…Don't you have another way to address me?\"\nIgnoring Isaac's protest, the black cat said,\n\"You have an intention to die here?\"\nA transparent smile naturally surfaced on Isaac's face.\nHe had already decided the answer to that question ten years ago.\n\"‘I' have been dead for a long time.\"\nIsaac Walker died ten years ago. The one here is just a defective doll without a face or name. Only the Duke of Crockford and Elliot know that.\nAs Isaac laughed darkly, the black cat stared intently at him with golden eyes.\n\"Hey Sparkly, should I guess your real name?\"\nIsaac's heart skipped a beat at those words.\nIf this black cat knew Isaac's name, it meant…that this cat, and its master the Silent Witch, knew the truth from ten years ago.\nThat's ridiculous. The only ones who should know about the body swap ten years ago are Duke Crockford and Elliot.\nIsaac swallowed hard, and the black dragon of Vorgan grinned at him…\n\"…Dammit. I forgot. Um, what was it? Ai? Zackzack? Water? Something like that?\"\nEven the composed Isaac couldn't help but burst out laughing, his shoulders shaking.\nThe black cat swished its tail ashamedly and glared at Isaac.\n\"Well, whaddya expect? I'm bad with human names. Calling you Sparkly is enough.\"\n\"Isaac Walker. I'd appreciate it if you could remember.\"\nWhen Isaac said that with a lingering laugh in his voice, the black cat turned away petulantly.\nBut this was surprising. If it could say Isaac's name, that meant…\n\"So Lady Everett found out my real identity, didn't she? Are you and her the only ones who know?\"\n\"It's not something I can go blabbing to just anyone.\"\n\"A wise decision.\"\nIf he carelessly revealed Isaac's identity, Duke Crockford would try to crush the Silent Witch with all his power. He didn't think that person would likely leave any evidence of the body swap ten years ago.\nEven if someone claimed Isaac Walker existed, they'd just be crushed by the Duke in the end.\n\"So you're not gonna spill everything honestly?\"\n\"No. That would mean failing to preserve Felix Ark Ridill's name.\"\nIf Isaac told the whole truth, the only thing left would be the dishonorable fact that Felix committed suicide ten years ago.\nThat won't do.\nIsaac can no longer keep calling himself Felix from now on. But at the very least, he wants Felix Ark Ridill's name to be remembered with some honor regarding his manner of death.\n\"I want Felix's past diplomatic achievements and dragon slaying exploits to be recorded as the real Second Prince's deeds. The wicked ‘Imperial Magician' then targeted the prince for those great feats, killing and swapping with him after the New Year's ceremony. And finally, the impostor is executed in a gruesome fashion…That's the flow I want.\"\nAll Isaac can think about now is how to preserve Felix's honor in death.\nFor Duke Crockford as well, having his grandson the Second Prince leave behind a noble tale aligns with his interests.\nFrom now on, Isaac will praise Felix's exploits with his own mouth, while being executed as the villain who tried to take advantage of them. Reviled by those who admired Felix.\n\"In two weeks, there will be a Supreme Council gathering the nation's top leaders. There, I will act as the worst villain who tried to steal the hero prince's name. The more infamous I become, the more tragically beautiful the hero prince's story will be.\"\nIsaac spoke in a singing tone, and the black cat looked at him like it was seeing something sickening, its nose scrunched up.\n\"…I can't comprehend how humans think at all.\"\n\"I don't think many humans could understand me either.\"\nHe was aware that he was insane.\nBut he couldn't stop now. He couldn't turn back anymore.\n\"Ah, but… Lady Everett knows about me. I have complicated feelings.\"\nIf possible, he didn't want the person he respected to see through his ugly lie.\nStill, a small part of his heart was happy.\n\"…That Lady Everett remembers my name makes me glad. Now I can face the execution stand with peace of mind.\"\nHe can slightly understand Felix's wish to not have his name forgotten now.\nThat said, Isaac doesn't wish to become a star. Just having his name remain in the memory of someone he respects is enough.\nIsaac smiled at the black cat with the smile of someone resigned to death.\n\"One last favor to ask? When the soldiers came to take me away, I hid a pocket watch with my contracted spirit Willdean's spirit stone inside in the bushes by the boys' dorm at the academy. Since my contract with Willdean will be automatically terminated after my execution, could you have that delivered to Lady Everett?\"\n\"Yeah, sure, I can pass that along.\"\nSaying that the black cat nimbly turned and scampered down the tower.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"…And that's what happened.\"\nBack in the guest room for the Seven Sages within Ridill Kingdom's castle grounds, Nero relayed everything he had seen and heard to Monica.\nAfter silently listening, Monica packed her few belongings into a travel bag and stood up.\nAs one of the Seven Sages, Monica could stay in this lavish guest room in the castle for as long as she pleased. But she had no intention of staying even one night.\nBecause Monica had something she needed to do now. And she couldn't afford to waste even a little time.\n\"Nero, we're making a detour before returning to the academy.\"\n\"As long as it's not somewhere cold again.\"\n\"Don't worry, it's very close to the capital.\"\nThe time limit was two weeks away.\nTwo weeks from now at the Supreme Council, the fate of the youth who impersonated Prince Felix would be decided.\nThe Supreme Council was essentially a gathering of the nation's leaders. As one of the Seven Sages, Monica would naturally attend… and so would Duke Crockford.\nThis Supreme Council would be the stage for the final confrontation.\nThere, Monica would have to fight.\nAgainst her fated enemy, Duke Crockford.",

      "content": "Hilda Everett was in despair.\nAs a researcher at the Institute of Magic Research, she had accumulated a massive amount of materials and experimental equipment, not only at her workplace but also at home.\nShe left all cleaning duties to her housemaid, but of course, she couldn't let the maid touch her research materials or experimental equipment, so she had to tidy them up herself——or rather, she thought she was tidying them up.\nFor Hilda, as long as she put the materials she had used haphazardly on an empty shelf or didn't leave them lying around on the floor or desk, that counted as being tidy.\nIf she stuffed old research data into a random shelf, even if it was crammed to the limit, that was considered tidy for her.\nAs a result, it was not uncommon for old research materials to avalanche out and cause a huge mess when she opened a shelf. And that was exactly what happened this time.\nThe moment she opened the shelf, the mountain of materials crammed to the limit came crashing down, hitting Hilda directly and scattering magnificently on the floor.\nBuried under the materials, Hilda adjusted her crooked glasses and muttered with the face of a scholar confronting a difficult problem:\n\"How strange. Why it becomes like this when I'm always tidying my things up…\"\nMuttering something that would make the maid shake her head in exasperation, she started clearing a path through the scattered materials.\nBut as she cleared them, more materials came tumbling down, so the tidying never seemed to end.\nJust as she was at a loss in the situation where she could barely find a foothold, she heard the sound of the maid coming up the stairs from downstairs.\nThis was bad. She would get scolded again.\n\"Lady Hilda, would it be better if I do it myself?\"\n\"Just a moment, please. I was simply conducting an experiment on falling motion with air resistance. It's not that the contents of the shelf fell out.\"\nThe middle-aged maid's face was full of exasperation as she watched Hilda hurriedly make excuses. The maid, who had been familiar with such situations for a long time, was not surprised anymore.\nLetting out a deep sigh, the maid put her hands on her hips and said,\n\"I can't make sense of what you're saying, but Miss Monica has arrived.\"\n\"…Eh?\"\nStartled by the mention of her adopted daughter's return, Hilda stood up hastily, inevitably stepping on the materials and sitting down with a magnificent thud.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"Welcome back, Monica.\"\nGreeting Monica, who was waiting in the living room drinking tea, Hilda was slightly limping and holding her lower back with her hand.\nSince they had heard a loud thud from upstairs just a little while ago, Monica, who knew her foster mother well, guessed that Hilda had messed something up and fallen again.\n\"Umm, are your back… okay?\"\n\"I'm fine, I was just conducting an experiment on falling motion with air resistance.\"\nIn other words, she had dropped something and made a mess on the floor.\nSince Monica was already used to such incidents, she didn't pry any further. Instead, she returned her teacup to the saucer and faced Hilda directly.\n\"Umm, there's something I want to ask of you, Hilda…\"\n\"What is it?\"\nHilda tilted her head with a smile, and Monica, feeling a little apologetic, came straight to the point,\n\"Please give me my father's research materials.\"\nThe smile vanished from Hilda's face.\n\"…No, I can't.\"\nThe brief pause before her answer was probably because she was debating whether to dodge the question or respond honestly.\nBut it wasn't for her own sake. Everything was out of consideration for Monica, as Monica knew.\n\"I did take your father Dr. Rayne's materials and hide them when he was arrested. But these are materials that cannot be made public… A smart girl like you should understand the reason, shouldn't you?\"\nIf Dr. Rayne's research materials were published, those who did not approve of Dr. Rayne's achievements——Duke Crockford——would surely extend his hands towards them.\nThat was Hilda's concern.\nThat's why Monica stated clearly,\n\"Hilda, I… I'm going… to fight Duke Crockford.\"\nHearing the word \"fight\" comes out of Monica's mouth, Hilda's eyes widen.\nMoreover, the opponent was Duke Crockford, the most powerful man in the country, who had driven Monica's father to his death.\nHilda had been hiding the fact that Duke Crockford was involved in Dr. Rayne's death from Monica all this time, to keep her safe.\n\"…So you've realized about Duke Crockford…\"\n\"I need my father's research materials to fight Duke Crockford… Please, lend me your strength.\"\nAs Monica bowed her head, Hilda folded her arms and fell silent.\nThe long silence was a reflection of Hilda's inner conflict.\n\"Monica, do you understand what kind of research your father Dr. Rayne was doing?\"\n\"I've read my father's books. I know what he was trying to create.\"\nThe Black Chalice—a magic tool that analyzes the mana patterns in blood to read a person's genetic information.\nWhile Monica understood the outline, recreating what her father had tried to make from scratch would undoubtedly take an immense amount of time.\nMonica excelled in mathematics and magic formulas, but she was inexperienced in creating magic tools. She could embed simple formulas into gems, but to make complex objects, she needed blueprints.\nHer father's research materials were absolutely necessary.\nMonica clenched her fists on her lap and said in a trembling voice,\n\"I have to fight Duke Crockford… That's why I need my father's research.\"\nSeeing Monica who's always chosen to run away until now, displaying her determination to fight for the first time, Hilda let out a deep, long breath.\n\"Come to think of it, the avalanche from the shelf might have been some kind of guidance.\"\n\"…?\"\n\"Follow me.\"\nHilda stood up and beckoned for Monica to follow.\nHilda led her to the study on the second floor of the Everett residence. The study door was left wide open, with sheets of paper scattered from inside into the hallway. Hilda picked up the papers with an embarrassed look and went into the room.\nInside, the floor was littered with materials, just as Monica had imagined. Hilda diligently picked them up and cleared a path to the storage shelves. Then she firmly pushed the back of an empty shelf.\nWith a clicking sound, a panel at the back came loose. Removing the panel revealed a small space behind it.\nThere, bound with a string, was a single bundle of materials stored.\n\"…This was all I could grab in a hurry.\"\nHilda handed the bundle of materials to Monica. Monica flipped through the thick materials, scanning them.\nThese were the very design blueprints for the magic tool——the unfinished Black Chalice——that Monica had been seeking.\nThis magic tool would be the key to rescuing Isaac.\nHowever, as Monica looked over the blueprints, she bit her lip in rising frustration.\nThe blueprints being over 80% complete is lucky, but… it requires more materials and equipment than I expected… especially the small parts, many of them will be hard to obtain…\nTo create this \"Black Chalice,\" she would need equipment equivalent to those at Minerva.\nBut she couldn't use Minerva. If she attempted to create a magic tool at Minerva, the perceptive Louis would undoubtedly notice.\nWhat Monica was about to do could not be known to Louis or any of the other Seven Sages.\nTo make this, I need equipment equivalent to Minerva… plus there are many special materials, so just gathering the materials would take a month… but the Supreme Council is in just two weeks…\nIn two weeks, at the Supreme Council, the fate of the young man who impersonated Felix Ark Ridill would be decided.\nMonica had laid just one stepping stone for that.\nBut to make use of that stepping stone, she was lacking far too many things.\nEquipment, materials, time, skills, information, manpower——she was overwhelmingly deficient in everything.\nStill, It's something I had to do. I have to do something… I had to, I had…",

      "content": "After returning to the girls' dormitory at Serendia Academy, Monica took a short nap, then sat at her desk from morning to night, scribbling on paper with her pen.\nNow, Monica was working on completing the research materials left by her father.\nThe design blueprints were eighty percent complete, but the finer details were still lacking. Monica was filling in these deficiencies by mobilizing all her knowledge.\nMonica was not an expert in those areas, so she honestly couldn't have handled it if those parts were missing. Fortunately, the basic sections requiring genetic and biological knowledge were already finished.\nThe remaining twenty percent was mainly about magic formulas, which was Monica's area of expertise. Even so, despite Monica's exceptional talent in magic and mathematics, she still couldn't complete the blueprints.\nSerendia Academy had been temporarily closed for three days, but regular classes would resume tomorrow.\nAt worst, she could skip classes, but there was a student council meeting after school. They would be discussing the future direction of the student council with the new and former members, so she couldn't skip that.\nLooking out the window, the sun had already set. Monica then realized she hadn't consumed anything but water since morning.\nAs she stood up, she felt a little dizzy. Since she would likely stay up all night tonight, she should eat some nuts and drink some coffee while she could.\nAs she was thinking this, Nero, who had been out, tapped on the window with his paw, holding something in his mouth.\n\"Welcome back.\"\nWhen Monica opened the window, Nero flew into the attic room and placed the object from his mouth onto the bed. It was a silver pocket watch bearing the royal family's crest.\n\"Finally found it. They said it was hidden in the bushes of the boys' dormitory, but I searched that area forever and couldn't find it.\"\nNero's jet-black fur was soiled in places, with small leaves stuck to it.\nMonica sat on the bed and plucked the leaves off Nero's fur.\n\"So where did you end up finding it?\"\n\"Oh, a crow had taken it back to its nest, y'see. That's where I, the great me, had an intense battle with those crows…\"\n\"……\"\n…How many people would believe that a black dragon fought crows?\n\"There I used my tail as a decoy to draw the crows' attention, then scratched it with these claws…\"\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" Monica responded with a non-committal acknowledgment as she held the pocket watch in her palm.\nOpening the lid revealed an ordinary pocket watch, but there seemed to be a slight bulge on the bottom. Twisting it firmly a few times, Monica felt a click.\nOpening the lid again, another dial was revealed beneath the clock face.\nIn the center was a large aquamarine gemstone, surrounded by a magic formula representing a contract with a spirit.\nThe spirit's name was \"Willdean\" and the contractor's name was \"Isaac Walker.\"\nContracting with a spirit requires an immense amount of mana, as well as the proper contract knowledge.\nFor Isaac to have acquired these skills through self-study means he must have had great talent as a mage.\n\"Hey, lizard! Come on out!\"\nNero called out to the aquamarine, but there was no response. Most likely due to Isaac, the contract holder, having sealed its power with a talisman, the contracted spirit couldn't manifest from the stone.\nMonica's specialty was wind magic. Willdean's element was water. Although she couldn't contract with it since their elements differed, she could share her magical power with it.\nChanneling her magic into the aquamarine of the pocket watch, a small light flickered inside the blue gemstone.\n[…Ah, is someone there?]\nA faint voice came from within the aquamarine, so soft it seemed it could be drowned out by the sound of the wind.\nNero peered into the aquamarine with interest.\n\"Yo, lizard. Can't see what's going on out here, can you?\"\n[…No, I cannot see…but I can faintly hear a voice… this voice is… Lord Black Dragon Wogan, is it not?]\nThe Black Dragon Wogan swished his tail back and forth as he tapped the aquamarine with his paw pads.\n\"Yeah. Your master had asked me to bring you with me if he died, y'see. So be grateful to me for retrieving this pocket watch after an intense battle.\"\nTo the self-satisfied black dragon after winning the battle with the crow, the spirit inside the aquamarine pleaded in a thin voice,\n[…Ah, ah…please…please help my master…that person is…]\n\"Just a fake, isn't he?\"\n[…So you know everything…]\nHis voice trailed off, a pause as if struggling with something.\nAs Monica hesitated whether to speak to him, Willdean started talking again.\n[Allow me to tell an old story…I was originally the contracted spirit of the late Queen, Lady Irene.]\nQueen Irene. The daughter of Duke Crockford, and the birth mother of the real Prince Felix.\nMonica didn't know much about the royal family, but she had heard that Queen Irene was very beautiful and gifted in magic spells.\nAs a contractor with one of the top spirits in the country, she undoubtedly possessed skills equivalent to an high-ranking magician.\n[Lady Irene was beautiful and wise… I cannot describe the feelings I held for her… trust, respect, adoration, admiration, or perhaps infatuation… I'm not sure which is appropriate… but I dearly cherished her.]\nHe had wanted her to smile.\nHe had wanted her to be happy.\nHe had wanted to grant her wishes.\nThe spirit, with senses different from humans, slowly revealed his heart bit by bit.\n[When Lady Irene became pregnant, she always wished that her child would not be bound by the position of royalty, and instead pursue individual happiness… I wanted to fulfill that wish.]\nAnyone would surely expect the prince to behave befittingly of royalty.\nIt would undoubtedly be difficult for a royal to pursue individual happiness.\nKnowing this, Wildean, as a non-human, simply wanted to be on the prince's side. He wanted the prince to experience even a modest personal happiness, no matter how small.\n…Willdean spoke in a sad voice.\nBut that wish did not come true.\nWith Queen Irene's death, the contracted spirit could no longer move freely and could only observe the outside world from within the gemstone.\nHe saw the young Felix bound by his position as royalty, having even modest joys taken from him by his grandfather.\nBeaten down without being able to meet his grandfather's expectations, crushed by the cruel truth, until he reached his death.\nWilldean could only watch.\n[…What Lord Felix wished for was Lord Isaac's happiness… If Lady Irene's wish could not be granted, then at least… I wanted to fulfill the wish of her son, Lord Felix.]\nMonica knew of the late Prince Felix's wish.\nKnowing it made her chest tighten with heartache.\n[If Lady ‘Silent Witch' is present, I beg of you, please… please hand me over to Lord Isaac.]\nAt Willdean's plea, Nero tilted his head in puzzlement.\n\"What good will handing you over to your master do?\"\n[Even in a sealed state, if I muster my last strength, I can cast an illusion spell once… I can take Lord Isaac's form and be executed in his place…]\nSpirits are originally formless beings, but by contracting with humans, they can temporarily gain a physical body.\nAnd a fatal wound in that physical state…can lead to the spirit's death.\n\"No.\"\nMonica who've been silent until now, stated firmly.\nThe light in the aquamarine flickered as if in confusion.\n[That voice is…surely not…]\nUnable to see the outside, Willdean did not realize who was sitting next to Nero.\nHaving always been with Isaac, Willdean knew this voice.\n[…You are…could you be Lady ‘Silent'…]\n\"I won't let anyone else become a sacrifice.\"\nMonica stood up from the bed and opened a desk drawer.\nInside were Monica's treasures.\nHer father's coffee pot, a ribbon from Lana, a handkerchief from Casey, a peridot necklace from Isaac… from among them, Monica gently lifted a dried white rose.\nIt was the flower ornament she had received from Cyril during the school festival. Though no longer fresh, Monica still remembered how she felt when receiving it.\n——This is a good luck charm to make Monica stronger.\nOn that festival day, when Monica collapsed from not relying on others, Cyril scolded her. He told her to learn to depend on people.\nMonica had been afraid to rely on others. That's why she had lived in seclusion all this time.\nEven then, she couldn't keep things like that.\nMonica alone lacked equipment, materials, time, skills, information, and strength——everything was overwhelmingly insufficient.\nSo Monica had to make a decision.\n…Even if it meant losing all these treasures in her drawer, and the happy memories of being Monica Norton.",

      "content": "After the temporary school closure ended, Lana Collete visited the student council room as a new student council member and frowned as she looked around the room.\nToday, the new and former student council members were supposed to discuss the future handover and the policy for the graduation ceremony.\nIn that case, it was natural for Monica, the former student council treasurer, to be present. However, Monica was nowhere to be seen in the student council room.\nLana took her seat and spoke to Claudia, who was already seated.\n\"Hey, Monica hasn't come yet?\"\n\"…Should you know it better?\"\n\"Monica hasn't been attending classes… In fact, I haven't seen her in the dorms for a few days.\"\nSince Monica was a serious and introspective person, she might have been troubled by the recent incident involving the kidnapping of the Second Prince and become unwell.\nIf that was the case, Lana secretly regretted not checking on Monica's room before coming to school.\nWhile they were discussing this, the new and former student council members gradually arrived and took their seats.\nThe former student council members are Cyril, Elliot, and Bridget.\nThe new student council members are Neil, Roberto, Eliane, Glenn, Rana, and Claudia, the self-proclaimed advisor.\n\"Hasn't the Treasurer Norton arrived yet?\"\nCyril, who was in the same class as Monica, asked Lana as he looked around the room.\nLana shook her head from side to side and gave the same explanation she had given to Claudia.\n\"Monica hasn't been attending classes.\"\n\"…Is she unwell? Well, we can't help it. Then, for now, let's start the meeting with those present…\"\nJust as Cyril was about to begin, there was a knock on the student council room door.\nEveryone thought it was Monica, but the people on the other side of the door were not who anyone expected… in fact, there were two of them.\n\"Excuse us.\"\n\"Mmm, mm, mm, mm, we're coming in.\"\nLana was momentarily speechless. Not just Lana, but everyone present was unable to hide their surprise and confusion.\nOne of the visitors was Albert Flau Roberia Ridill, a second-year Junior Divison student and the Third Prince of the Ridill Kingdom.\nThe other was Hubert Dee, a third-year Senior Division student and a troublemaker who had caused a duel incident at the beginning of the new semester.\nWhile everyone was at a loss for words, Glenn was the first to speak.\n\"Albert, what's going on? …And you, Red Hair, what's your business here?\"\nGlenn's words to Albert were those of a close friend, but his tone towards Hubert was slightly prickly.\nHowever, Hubert didn't seem to mind as he laughed and shook his red hair.\n\"Why am I here, you ask? Well, Monica asked me to come here after school today.\"\n\"I was asked the same thing by Monica this morning to come to the student council room.\"\nHubert and Albert's words only added to the confusion in the room.\nWhy would Monica, who was not present, have asked Albert and Hubert to come here?\nIf she couldn't attend the meeting due to illness and wanted them to act as her proxies, she should have said so from the beginning. However, neither of them mentioned any specific purpose from Monica.\nIn any case, they couldn't leave Albert, a member of the royal family, standing there, so the considerate Neil prepared a chair for him. Hubert, on the other hand, casually took a seat on the guest sofa, putting his feet up.\nAn indescribable atmosphere filled the student council room.\nWithout Monica's true intentions being clear, and with the complete outsider Hubert present, they couldn't start the meeting. Moreover, they couldn't fathom Monica's motives.\nLana raised her hand slightly.\n\"Shall I go to the dorms and check on Monica's condition?\"\n\"I appreciate it if you could,\" said Cyril.\nLana nodded and was about to stand up when there was another knock on the student council room door.\n\"…Excuse me.\"\nThat timid voice undoubtedly belonged to Monica.\nThe door slowly opened.\nThere stood Monica in her uniform, looking pale and with disheveled hair.\nMonica was clutching a long, rod-like object wrapped in cloth in her hand. It was about a head taller than Monica herself, and the cloth was tightly wound around it.\nBehind Monica stood an orange ringlet-haired girl.\nLana recognized the girl. She was Isabelle Norton, a first-year Senior Division student. She was the daughter of Count Kerbeck from the eastern region and was rumored to be bullying Monica.\nWhat was the object Monica was holding?\nWhy was Isabelle Norton standing behind her?\nFor what purpose did Monica call Albert and Hubert here?\nAmidst these questions, Monica closed the door and locked it.\n\"Treasurer Norton. What is the meaning of this? Explain the situation,\" Cyril demanded.\nMonica gripped the wrapped object tightly and answered with a trembling voice.\n\"…I'm sorry for acting on my own.\"\nMonica looked like she was about to cry. Unable to bear watching her, Lana spoke from her seat.\n\"Hey, Monica. Are you okay? Are you feeling unwell?\"\n\"…No… That's not it.\"\nMonica shook her head vigorously, looking at Lana with a tearful expression.\nWhy was she making such a face? It seemed as if she was about to confess to a crime.\n\"There's something, I must tell everyone here, no matter what.\"\nMonica took a deep breath and raised her head. A somber expression hung on her youthful face.\n\"As you all must know, the fate of the criminal who impersonated Prince Felix Ark Ridill will be decided at the Supreme Council meeting in two weeks.\"\nThis was a fact known to everyone present.\nTwo weeks from now—despite being such a significant incident, the Supreme Council meeting was being held exceptionally early. This was either due to the King's poor health or someone's intention to resolve the matter before the social season began.\nIn any case, everything would be settled in two weeks.\n\"But, I want, to help… the one you all know, as the student council president.\"\nLana was perplexed. She herself was still undecided on whether the captured Felix was an impostor or falsely accused.\nHowever, Monica spoke as if she was convinced that the captured Felix should not be executed.\nLana wasn't the only one perplexed. Everyone seemed uncertain of what to say.\nIn the midst of this, it was Elliot who spoke up in his usual casual tone.\n\"That's impossible. You know that, right? The Supreme Council is a meeting of the nation's top officials. No matter how noble we are, we're still just kids. We can't be involved in the council…\"\n\"We can.\"\nMonica stated firmly and repeated herself slowly.\n\"No, I can.\"\nThen, Monica placed her hand on the wrapped object and bowed her head deeply.\n\"I truly apologize… for having lied… until now.\"\nHer small hands removed the cloth wrapping.\nBeneath the cloth was a beautifully crafted golden staff with intricate metalwork.\nIn the Ridill Kingdom, a magician's rank is determined by the length of their staff. Only seven people in the entire kingdom are permitted to wield a staff taller than their own height.\n\"I am Monica Everett, one of the Seven Sages of the Ridill Kingdom, known as the Silent Witch. Please, lend me your strength.\"",

      "content": "Special Thanks to Phil for the generous donation. Thank you so much!! 🙇🙇\nHere's a bonus chapter.\n\"I am Monica Everett, one of the Seven Sages of the Ridill Kingdom, known as the Silent Witch. Please, lend me your strength.\"\nThose words froze the air in the room.\nNo one could comprehend the meaning of what she said, and they were perplexed and confused.\nMonica gripped her staff tightly, keeping her head bowed, desperately trying not to tremble.\nShe was afraid to look up.\nShe was afraid to know how everyone was looking at her.\n\"…Monica, hey…you're joking, right?\"\nThose hoarse words came from Lana.\nAh, she had to say it. Say it with her own mouth. \"I'm sorry for deceiving you all this time.\"\nLast night, she had imagined this moment over and over and over, thinking about what she should say, but her mouth was dry as a bone, and her tongue wouldn't move.\nBreaking the silence in place of Monica was Isabelle, who had been standing behind her.\n\"It's understandable that you would all be surprised. However, I, Isabelle Norton, representing the House of Count Kerbeck, will testify. This person is the genuine user of chantless magic who defeated the Black Dragon Wogan, the Silent Witch of the Seven Sages.\"\nEven after Isabelle's firm declaration, those in the room still looked half-skeptical.\nAmong them, Hubert whistled as he leaned back on the sofa.\n\"Hmm, hmm hmm hmm… It'd be quicker to just show this than explain with words, eh?\"\nWith a snap of Hubert's fingers, the ring on his finger ominously glowed red, spawning ten arrows of flame.\nThe flames unleashed from Hubert's prized magic tool flew straight at Monica.\nIt was a certain kill, not giving her a moment to chant a defensive barrier.\nAs soon as Monica raised her head and spotted the flames, she chantlessly unleashed ice arrow magic.\nAnd with them, she shot down all of Hubert's flame arrows.\nThe corners of Hubert's mouth twisted into a fiendish, delighted grin.\n\"Well then, how about this?\"\nHubert spread his fingers as wide as they could go, then abruptly clenched them into a fist. The ten flame arrows surrounding him coalesced into a single spear of flame.\nIts scorching, spark-spewing spearhead wasn't aimed at Monica, but at the others seated at the table.\nCyril and Glenn, who were familiar with that magic, tried to hastily cast defensive barriers and counters, but it was too late.\n\"Senior Dee.\"\nMonica struck the floor with a thud of her staff.\nWith just that, water snaked out of Monica's staff and coiled around the flame spear.\n\"…Please… don't use offensive magic… indoors.\"\n\"Why not? My Uncle goes wild even indoors, doesn't he?\"\n\"…I know.\"\nRecalling the time they got caught in the crossfire on New Year's, Monica turned her gaze forward.\nLana and the others now looked at Monica with eyes of utter disbelief. Even the usually expressionless Claudia had her eyes wider than usual.\nAs Hubert had intended, the effect of demonstrating her chantless magic was immense, more impactful than any explanation.\nEven those unfamiliar with magic knew that \"normally, one cannot use magic without chanting incantations.\"\nAnyone with even a bit of magical knowledge would understand how extraordinary Monica's skill was to instantly shoot down Hubert's flame arrows.\nMonica gripped her staff tightly and forced out her voice.\n\"…Will you…listen to me?\"\nThere was a clatter as someone stood up from their chair——it was Cyril.\nWith quiet steps, Cyril approached Monica and looked down at her.\nWhen Monica averted her eyes, Cyril knelt down and bowed her head to Monica.\n\"Please forgive my rudeness until now. Lady Everett.\"\nThe polite apology, calmly spoken, pierced Monica's heart more than any curse would.\nAt a loss for words, Cyril told her flatly,\n\"So it was you who saved me when my mana went out of control last autumn.\"\n\"…! How did you… know about that…?\"\nIndeed, Monica had stopped Cyril's mana outburst when she had just enrolled at the academy.\nBut she had been completely concealed at the time… Monica's expression stiffened as Cyril glanced at her hand.\n\"The hooded person who saved me last autumn, and the person I met at the palace during the New Year's ceremony…and Treasurer Norton's hands were strikingly similar.\"\nMonica's hands were indeed small and childlike compared to other girls her age.\nHowever, Monica had never imagined that Cyril, let alone Felix, would figure out her true identity.\n\"So, Lord Cyril… have you realized who I really am at that time?\"\n\"I did not gain complete certainty, but…\"\nCyril lowered his long lashes.\n\"As a representative of the Seven Sages, the nation's treasures, I sincerely apologize for my numerous discourtesies towards you.\"\nDumbfounded by Cyril's earnest apology, Monica stood frozen.\n——\nPlease, think nothing of it. It can't be helped since I concealed my identity.\nShe knew she should say something like that to put this matter to rest and move on to the main issue, but her tongue refused to cooperate.\nI have to properly say, \"It's okay.\" It's because I'm the Silent Witch…\nMonica knew that if she revealed her identity, Cyril and the others would treat her more respectly.\nThey would keep their distance. She had steeled herself for all of it.\nAnd yet…\n\"…I don't want that.\"\nA lump formed in her throat, and her eyes felt hot.\nThe words she had prepared for today flew out of her head, and her mouth started moving on its own.\n\"…Don't use honorifics with me… I don't want that…\"\nHot droplets spilled from her eyes. And as if a dam had burst, tears streamed out one after another.\nMonica hurriedly tried to wipe her tears with the back of her hand, but they wouldn't stop. Her throat kept hitching, making unsightly noises.\nAs Monica cried and hiccuped like a child, Cyril furrowed his brow in a fluster.\n\"L-Lady Everett…\"\n\"I like your usual, grumpy better…hic…wah, waaaah…\"\n\"……..\"\nNow Monica crouched down, clinging to her staff and soaking her sleeve with her tears as she curled up.\n\"I'm sorry… for lying so much… I'm sorry… for deceiving you…I'm sorry…\"\nOnce overcome with guilt, Monica could do nothing but apologize. She was utterly useless.\nShe was one of the Seven Sages. She had things she had to do.\nI knew I couldn't behave like this…!\nAnd yet, her tears and sobs wouldn't stop.\nShe was afraid to stand up and face everyone's reactions.\nAfraid of being cursed as a liar, of being scorned as a disgrace despite being one of the Seven Sages…\nIt's scared me, It's frightening…\nAs she trembled in a crouch, she heard the sound of someone standing up from a chair with a thud.\nWhen Monica flinched and looked up, someone was kneeling in front of her——It was Lana.\nLana's mouth was へ-shaped, and her brows were furrowed in an angry expression. Seeing Monica shrink back from her scowl, Lana took out a handkerchief from her pocket and forcefully pressed it against Monica's face.\n\"You idiot Monica. How can you fight when you're crying like that?\"\n\"F-Fight…? So you're…angry…\"\nAs Monica trembled, Lana roughly wiped her face while scolding her.\n\"Yeah, I'm angry! I'm mad that you kept secrets from me! ‘Were you deceiving me this whole time!? Didn't you trust me!?' That's what I'm thinking! …But,\"\nLana pouted sullenly, muttering, \"But just because I'm angry doesn't necessarily mean I hate you.\"\nWhen Monica repeatedly opened and closed as she let out meaningless words, Lana pinched her nose firmly.\n\"Ugmmmpph…\"\n\"And yeah, I'm frustrated, but I can kinda understand that you had reasons for not revealing the truth. I'm not that dumb.\"\n\"Uuuh…\"\n\"…So. I still think of you as a friend. Don't you feel the same, Monica?\"\nLana's face right in front of her was a little teary-eyed.\nThat's right, Monica wasn't the only one shaken. Lana had just had the truth suddenly revealed to her as well.\nWith her nose pinched, Monica answered through her sobs,\n\"I tho too…\"\nLana nodded firmly. \"Good.\" She pressed the handkerchief into Monica's hand.\nThen Lana went behind Monica, grabbed her shoulders, and turned her to face Cyril again.\n\"My apologies for the wait, Vice President Ashley. Please, go ahead.\"\nIt's that what Lana said. But go ahead with what? Monica blinked cluelessly.\nClearing his throat, Cyril spoke up.\n\"——Treasurer Norton!\"\nThe sharp voice cracked like a whip, resonating through the student council room.\nAs abruptly as if she had hiccuped, Monica's sobs stopped.\n\"How could a student council member act in such an unsightly manner! A student council officer ought to be an example for the entire student body at all times! First, do something about that disgraceful face!\"\nWith a raised eyebrow, Cyril scolded, and Monica opened her puffy eyes wide.\n\"…It's the usual Lord Cyril.\"\nWhen Monica said that nasally, Cyril awkwardly cleared his throat again.\n\"Since you're still attending as a student, there'll be no change to your position as a student council member. So, it's still fine to call you Treasurer Norton.\"\n\"…Yes, I'm… okay… with Treasurer Norton…\"\nWith a tear-stained face, Monica gave a feeble smile.",

      "content": "More bonus chapter.\n\"Miss Monica, I have prepared a comfortable cloth for you, so please use it to wipe your face. Agatha is preparing a warm drink at the moment, so please wait a little longer.\"\nThe rumor of Miss Monica, the daughter of the eastern House of Count Kerbeck is famous in the academy for being treated as a servant and bullied by her own relative Isabelle.\nNo one could hide their complex expressions at the sight of Isabelle diligently attending to Monica.\nElliot put his hand to his forehead and looked up at the sky.\n\"…I feel like I've aged drastically in these past few minutes… I can't believe I've said ‘Know your place'… to Miss Norton… the Magic Count… someone please kill me already…\"\nAs Elliot muttered that, Claudia, who was lying on the desk like a corpse, groaned in a lifeless voice.\n\"…To have spoken of the Silent Witch in front of the Silent Witch herself… I feel like an utter fool…\"\nClaudia was referring to the tea party when she first met Monica.\nAt that time, Claudia had mentioned the Silent Witch.\nThat the Silent Witch is an intellectual and clever person who knows the value of silence.\n\"…And my brother-in-law had already caught on somewhat… yes… right now, I really want to die.\"\n\"Miss Claudia, p-please stay strong…\"\nNeil hurriedly tried to console Claudia, who looked like she might hang herself right there.\nIn the midst of this, the usually quiet Glenn, who had been holding back from speaking, raised his hand and said, \"Oh, oh!\"\n\"So, does that mean Monica also took down the dragon in Duke Reinberg's territory!?\"\n\"At that time… I failed to provide proper support, and caused you great trouble, Glenn…\"\nMonica apologized meekly, but Glenn approached her with sparkling eyes.\n\"Then, then! Was it also you who beat up my master in the Seven Sages Selection Exam, Monica!?\"\nGlenn's master, in other words, the Barrier Magician Louis Miller, is one of the most martial among the Seven Sages.\nEveryone's eyes widened at the fearsome remark that she had beaten up Louis.\n\"It's a misunderstanding… at that time, I just kept using wide-range magic because I was scared of him…\"\nAs Monica shook her head vigorously enough to nearly snap her neck off, Hubert interjected with a snicker.\n\"For your information, the one who beat me up in that magic duel the other day was also this girl.\"\n\"Ah, that's because Senior Dee was going to do something terrible to everyone…\"\n\"The way you slowly tortured me with the latest high-level tracking formulas, rewriting my magic tools to seize the initiative, and mercilessly demonstrated your overwhelming power… it was the best, wasn't it, Mo.Ni.Ka?\"\n\"Please stoooop…\"\nThe information kept pouring out, with phrases like \"who beat up so-and-so\" sounding fearsome each time. The gap between these accounts and the timid image of Monica Norton left everyone confused.\nAlbert was muttering, \"Come to think of it, her appearance and stature at the ceremony were indeed…\" while Eliane was smiling and saying, \"Well, well,\" but her gaze was unfocused.\nIn the midst of this, there was one man whose composure did not waver.\n\"In other words, the Seven Sages of this country are a group of chess masters. Are the other Six Sages also strong?\"\nAt the words of the ever-straightforward chess-obsessed man, Roberto Vinkel, even Monica could only give a wry smile.\n\"Well… the Seven Sages and chess are unrelated, you see…\"\nElliot put his hand to his head as if nursing a headache and muttered.\n\"The Seven Sages are the best magicians in the Ridill Kingdom. They hold a position equivalent to a count and serve as advisors to the king.\"\n\"In other words, Lady Monica plays chess with the king…!?\"\n\"Please get away from chess already!!\"\nElliot let out a scream-like voice and slumped onto the desk in exhaustion.\nBeside him, Bridget murmured.\n\"I finally understand.\"\nBridget pressed her finger to the furrow between her brows and looked back and forth between Monica and Isabelle.\n\"I had only thought you were an intelligence agent of the House of Count Kerbeck… but to be precise, you were acting as His Highness's bodyguard, backed by the House of Count Kerbeck.\"\n\"Y-Yes… that's right… you see, I was told to secretly guard His Highness without his knowing…\"\n\"Only the king can give orders to the Seven Sages… so it makes sense that you couldn't reveal your true identity.\"\nBridget tapped the desk with her slender fingers and fixed her amber eyes on Monica.\n\"And for one of the Seven Sages to reveal her own identity… it must mean there are significant circumstances, correct?\"\nMonica gulped and nodded once.\nThis was the main issue at hand.\nMonica took out a leather-bound diary——the real diary of Felix Ark Ridill.\n\"Before explaining the circumstances… I want all of you to read this first.\"\nMonica stood up and placed the diary between Elliot and Bridget.\nShe intended for everyone here to read the diary, but she wanted these two, who knew the real Prince Felix, to read it first.\nAlthough Elliot and Bridget looked perplexed, they immediately opened their eyes wide when they saw the first page.\n\"Hey, Miss Norton, where did you get this…?\"\n\"Please read it all first. I want everyone present here to read it.\"\nWhen Monica quietly told them that, Elliot and Bridget silently began reading the diary.\nConveniently timed, Agatha, Isabelle's maid, had brought tea for everyone, so they all drank tea and exchanged comments about Monica's true identity while waiting for Elliot and the others to finish reading the diary.\nEventually, Elliot and Bridget seemed to reach the last page, as they both took a sharp breath.\nElliot's complexion was particularly pale.\n\"Hey, Miss Norton, this means… then, he is…\"\nElliot had heard about the true ending of Prince Felix from Isaac.\nThat must be why he couldn't hide his agitation.\nBridget, too, had a pained expression with her thin brows furrowed.\nMonica nodded once to the two of them.\n\"…First, I want everyone present here to read this diary. And after that… I have a request for all of you.\"\nAs Monica said, Elliot passed the diary he had finished reading to Cyril and Neil sitting next to him. In this way, everyone in this room read Prince Felix's diary in a clockwise order.\nThe diary recorded the truth from ten years ago.\nThe friendship between the young prince and Isaac, the plotting of Duke Crockford, and… Prince Felix's true wish.\nAfter Hubert, who received the diary last, finished reading it while leaning back on the sofa, he slowly turned his head to look at Monica.\n\"Hmm, hmm, hmm, so in other words, ten years ago, the Second Prince and this Isaac guy switched places? After writing this diary, where did the real Second Prince go?\"\n\"…I heard he passed away.\"\n\"Well, that would be the reasonable assumption. To summarize, the Felix Ark Ridill we all know… let's call him the ‘Student Council President' to avoid confusion. The Student Council President is actually Isaac… hmmm? In that case, it contradicts the Jewelled Magician's recent accusation that he had just recently switched with an imposter, doesn't it?\"\nAfter muttering that, Hubert showed a wicked grin.\n\"…I see. The Student Council President and Duke Crockford had been cooperating until now. But for some reason, they had a falling out, and Duke Crockford decided to dispose of his co-conspirator, the Student Council President… the Jewelled Magician is just a sacrificial pawn, huh?\"\nHubert's quick thinking and sharp deduction were appreciated at this moment.\nMonica nodded and opened her mouth.\n\"That person… the Student Council President is only fixated on preserving the honor of the real Prince Felix. For that purpose, he intends to die as a great criminal.\"\nPreserving the name of Felix Ark Ridill. That was Isaac's sole motivation.\nFor that, he had abandoned his own face and name and lived for ten years… as the perfect prince acknowledged by all.\n\"But if that person is executed as the Imperial Magician… that could become the spark for a war with the Empire.\"\nThat Duke Crockford is eager for war is something that everyone present has likely heard to some degree.\nOnly Glenn, who was unfamiliar with domestic affairs, tilted his head and said, \"Is that so?\" prompting Albert to groan with a bitter expression.\n\"…So this is why he was trying to forcefully push my engagement with Miss Eliane.\"\n\"Eh!? Albert and Elly are getting engaged!?\"\nAs Glenn raised his voice, Eliane fidgeted and averted her gaze.\n\"W-Well, it's not decided yet. Father just suddenly said that…\"\nIn contrast to the flustered Eliane, Albert remained composed. However, his eyes burned with quiet anger.\n\"Eliane's father, Duke Reinberg, is on close terms with Duke Crockford. The two dukes likely intend to install me, the Third Prince, as the next king. The engagement is a means to that end.\"\nOnce Albert became king, Duke Crockford would wield power as his regent and eventually lead an invasion of the Empire.\nTherefore, the inconvenient puppet is no longer needed by Duke Crockford.\n\"I want to help the Student Council President and also prevent a war.\"\nIn response to Monica's assertion, Claudia, still lying on the desk like a corpse, muttered.\n\"It's impossible.\"\nClaudia's words, as a descendant of the ‘House of Scholars', carried weight.\n\"…True, publicizing this diary would reveal Duke Crockford's crimes from ten years ago… but it would also reveal the crimes of Isaac, his co-conspirator… Isaac's execution would be unavoidable…\"\nClaudia was right. Even if the full truth were made public, Isaac's death could not be avoided.\nMonica clenched her fists on her lap and spoke, enunciating each word carefully.\n\"There is one strategy… I have in mind.\"\nIt was hardly worthy of being called a \"strategy\"… it was Monica's biggest gamble in her life.\nBut with this, she could avoid both Isaac's execution and the war.\n\"I cannot carry out this operation alone… I need everyone's help.\"\nAs Monica said that and bowed her head, Cyril spoke in his usual stern tone.\n\"Treasurer Norton, explain the outline first. Whether we lend our aid will depend on that explanation.\"\nAlthough stern, his attitude of prompting her to continue was appreciated by the current Monica.",

      "content": "Everyone was left speechless upon hearing Monica's proposed plan.\nCertainly, that method could avoid war and Isaac's execution…but.\n\"…If we fail, it won't just be getting expelled from the Seven Sages. We'll be executed, fake included.\"\nClaudia's words summed it all up.\nMonica nodded resolutely. She had already steeled her resolve.\n\"If that happens, I will take full responsibility.\"\nIn the Supreme Council meeting, Monica alone would actually carry out the plan.\nIn the worst case, she was prepared for the possibility of being solely held responsible and executed. That level of resolve was necessary to go against Duke Crockford.\nIn the tense atmosphere, Cyril spoke up.\n\"Instead of worrying about failure, we should use our heads to increase the chances of this operation succeeding.\"\nHis words changed the mood in the room.\nAt least Cyril was willing to consider the plan positively.\nCyril looked at Monica with the keen eyes he showed during meetings.\n\"Treasurer Norton, I have questions about the operation. Specifically, about the important magic tool…\"\n\"It will be the Black Chalice.\"\nThe magic tool Monica's father had tried to create. A device that could determine blood relations by analyzing blood.\nThis was absolutely necessary for the operation.\n\"But… is it really possible to make it?\"\nInstead of answering, Monica took out the materials she had brought. As thick as a dictionary, it contained her father's design plans with Monica's additions.\nMonica handed the materials to Hubert, sitting on the sofa.\n\"You're more knowledgeable about magic tool creation than me, Senior Dee…would you mind taking a look?\"\n\"Mmm, Mmm, I thought I was just called here to testify that you're the real Silent Witch…so this is the main task, eh?\"\nHubert skimmed through the materials.\nHe read at a speed that made one doubt if he was actually reading, but Hubert had comprehended the contents perfectly.\nAfter going through the last page, Hubert threw his head back and laughed loudly.\n\"Ahyahyah! What's this! This thing requires the types of equipment and materials used by Minerva's professors! The estimated budget alone could build a mansion in the capital!\"\n\"I have the money. I…never spent my salary.\"\n\"Where will you procure the materials? Obsidian and hematite processed for magic tool, and various chemical solutions for mana particles extraction won't be easy to obtain, right?\"\nYes, creating the Black Chalice required equipment, materials, and time.\nWhich is why Monica determined she couldn't do it alone.\n\"…Lana, can you procure the items listed here within a week?\"\nSeeing the materials list, Lana's eyes widened slightly.\nBut soon her eyes narrowed, the eyes of a skilled merchant.\n\"For the ores, I can check the inventory at the Southern Doll Port branch immediately. Even if they're out of stock, I have many connections with jewelers to definitely obtain them. For the chemical solutions, my father has an acquaintance at a magic tool trading company, so we'll have to rely on them. One week might be too tight, but if we use fast horses, I think we can just make it.\"\nIf Monica tried to procure all this herself, it would take over a month. Magic tool materials are that difficult to obtain.\nThere were only two weeks left until the Supreme Council meeting. One week for materials, and less than a week with Hubert's help for tool creation. It would be cutting it close.\nHubert was undoubtedly a genius at magic tool creation. Technically more skilled than Monica.\n\"…If we have the materials, you can make it, right, Senior Dee?\"\n\"To make this, we'd need proper equipment… It'd be possible if it's Minerva, but I'm banned from there.\"\n\"No.\"\nWhile Minerva was the best place for researching magic, and had excellent facilities for tool creation, acting there risked being noticed by Louis, which had to be avoided at all costs.\nSo Monica had already secured an alternative facility.\n\"For the facilities… I've secretly made arrangements with Count Anvard.\"\nThe name Monica mentioned made everyone look perplexed.\nExcept Neil, who exclaimed, \"Ah, the chess tournament guy!\"\nThe recently-succeeded young Count Anvard, Barney Jones.\nMonica's classmate from Minerva and current rival.\nLana muttered \"That dorky glasses guy?\" under her breath, making Monica smile wryly.\n\"I rushed to meet Barney…the Anvard Count this morning and got permission to borrow his facilities.\"\nAnvard County was home to many skilled craftsmen and renowned workshops for magic tool processing. Monica made arrangements with Barney to borrow one of them.\nBeing located between the capital and Serendia Academy made Anvard County conveniently situated for travel.\nWith Barney's facilities, Lana's procuring materials, Hubert's expertise, and everyone's cooperation, creating the Black Chalice was feasible.\n\"Mmm, mmm, I haven't agreed to help yet… Of course, there's a reward for me, right?\"\nAs Hubert leered lecherously, Glenn frowned.\nBut Hubert's remark was expected by Monica.\n\"…I'll arrange for the kind of magical duel you love so much, Senior Dee.\"\n\"You'll be my opponent, right, Monica?\"\n\"No. But it will definitely be a formidable foe worthy of your satisfaction, Senior Dee.\"\nAnd this magic duel was a key part of the operation.\n——To stall a certain individual, a magic duel is necessary.\nWhen Monica named that individual, everyone fell silent, and Hubert burst into raucous laughter.\n\"Good, good! An opportunity like that doesn't come often! Hyahaha! As expected of my queen. You know how to handle your dog.\"\n\"Um, Senior Dee…that my queen thing… could you… stop it…\"\nMonica protested with an embarrassed expression, but of course, Hubert paid no heed.\nIn fact, Hubert stood up from the sofa, went before Monica, and knelt down with a broad grin.\n\"Command me, my queen. Tell your hunting dog to tear out the prey's windpipe.\"\n\"Well, you don't have to go that far… just stalling will be enough…\"\nThe disturbing sight of Hubert kneeling before Monica left everyone at a loss for words.\nAs Monica whimpered \"Awawawa\" in embarrassment under their stares, Cyril cleared his throat loudly.\n\"I understand the outline of Treasurer Norton's operation. As the Serendia Academy Student Council Vice President, I permit its execution…but—\"\nCyril paused and surveyed everyone in the room.\n\"—This is an operation where one misstep could lead to ruin. Participation is not mandatory. If anyone wishes to withdraw, leave now.\"\n\"I'm in.\"\nLana spoke without hesitation.\n\"If a friend asks for my help, I'll give my all. Time is precious, so I'll start moving as soon as this meeting ends.\"\nLana snorted haughtily with a defiant smile.\n\"I'll cooperate too.\"\nSurprisingly, Prince Albert was the next to nod.\n\"I can't stand the idea of things going Duke Crockford's way. As a royal, I have my pride…I want to get back at the adults who looked down on me.\"\nNeil then raised his hand earnestly and spoke.\n\"I'll cooperate too. I don't think the chances of this operation succeeding are low at all. If we work together, we can surely rescue the Student Council President and avoid war.\"\n\"If Neil is cooperating… then I can't let him fall to ruin if we fail…\"\nBeside the sincere Neil, Claudia muttered in seeming annoyance.\n\"I will also assist.\"\nIt was Roberto Vinkel who raised his hand smoothly.\nThe only person here from the neighboring Randall Kingdom.\n\"If the Ridill Kingdom and the Empire go to war, my Randall Kingdom bordering them won't be spared… No, the Ridill Kingdom will likely attack Randall first to gain a foothold for invading the Empire. But more than that…\"\nRoberto's rugged features hardened as he looked at Monica.\n\"My brother told me, ‘Never miss a chance to prove your manliness.'\"\nProve his manliness? Monica wondered what that meant.\nWas he just supposed to keep looking at Roberto?\nConfused, Monica received Roberto's solemn words.\n\"Please, feel free to observe me thoroughly, Miss Monica.\"\n\"Y-Yes…\"\n\"Your conduct in this operation will determine everything, Monica Norton.\"\nBridget deliberately used Monica's surname as she spoke haughtily, chin raised.\n\"The Supreme Council gathers this nation's elite…With such unrefined behavior, anything you say will only be met with scorn.\"\n\"U-Ugh… that's…\"\nAware her appearance and conduct lacked the dignity befitting a Seven Sage, Monica shrank timidly.\nBridget snapped her fan shut sharply and declared, \"I shall provide thorough guidance to ensure my fellow Student Council member does not embarrass us at the Supreme Council.\"\nThe confident smile on her beautiful face wavered ever so slightly, tinged with sadness.\n\"When you rescue that foolish servant, be sure to convey His Highness Felix's final wish.\"\nMonica gasped, then nodded firmly.\nElliot sighed wearily.\n\"…Geez, this is a pain. I really intended to just be an observer.\"\nYes, Elliot had been a mere observer all along. Knowing much yet never deeply involved, just watching.\nEven so, he knew Isaac and Felix better than anyone else here.\n\"Ah, that's right. I never got to say ‘serve you right!' to that guy. Lending a hand in the rescue to laugh in his face wouldn't be so bad.\"\nElliot grinned wryly and told Monica, \"I'll get to savor the look on his face when the guy he hates most rescues him.\"\n\"Um, what about you, Lord Glenn?\"\nIt was Eliane whispering tentatively to Glenn.\nAs the person most likely to voice approval or objection first in such cases, Glenn's silence and pensive expression were conspicuous.\nOf course, Glenn would be the most conflicted about participating in this operation.\nMonica couldn't force Glenn's cooperation either.\nWith everyone's eyes on him, as he mulled his decision, Glenn finally spoke slowly.\n\"…Yeah, I've decided. I really thought it through myself.\"\nGlenn spoke as if trying to convince himself.\n\"When I was at Minerva, I hated that school. Nothing but unpleasantness, not a bit of fun.\"\nSaying so, Glenn glanced briefly at Hubert, who remained nonchalant.\nGlenn looked slightly irritated but composed himself and continued.\n\"But since coming to Serendia Academy, every day has been super fun. That's partly thanks to Neil and Monica for having you as my friends… but there's also the Student Council President's influence too.\"\nAs Glenn recounted memories like the courtyard barbecue and cultural festival play, Cyril furrowed his brow, muttering \"A courtyard barbecue?!\"\nNeil just smiled wryly, trying to placate the indignant Cyril.\n\"So I wanna save the Student Council President! And then! I'll congratulate him on graduating at the graduation ceremony!\"\n\"Glenn… thank you.\"\nAs Monica bowed deeply, Glenn flashed his usual bright grin.\n\"No need for the mushy stuff!\"\nSeeing Glenn's trademark smile, Eliane seemed relieved as she patted her chest.\n\"I… I can at least help behind the scenes, I think.\"\nWith Eliane voicing her assent, no one else made a move to leave the room.\nCyril nodded. \"Very well.\"\nHe surveyed everyone.\n\"From this moment, we shall commence the Serendia Academy Student Council President Rescue Operation!\"\nAt Cyril's powerful declaration, Monica felt her blood pulsing loudly through her entire body.\nWhat they were about to undertake was an extremely reckless gamble. Their foe was the nation's most influential person, no less. The odds were against them.\nFailure meant certain ruin.\nAnd yet, Monica felt no trembling fear. A stronger emotion filled her chest instead.\n\"…I will make it succeed, no matter what.\"\nThe words slipped out before she realized, making Cyril smirk confidently.\n\"Of course.\"",

      "content": "The young Count Barney Jones, who had just inherited his territory last month, was an extremely busy man.\nThere were so many things he had to learn, and people to greet, and he could hardly spare any time to rest. The only time he left his office was to inspect the town.\nThe territory he ruled had many craftsmen, and its income from industrial and magic tool development was among the top three in the country.\nWhile the Empire focused on medical magic, the Ridill Kingdom focused on magic tool development. However, even in Ridill, there weren't many workshops that handled large-scale industrial magic tools.\nThe territory with the most industrial magic tool workshops was Anvard County.\nThe workshop Barney was heading to was one that produced special magic tools.\nGoing back a few days earlier…\nMonica Everett, the Silent Witch and one of the Seven Sages who was Barney's lifelong rival, had suddenly barged into Barney's mansion and demanded to borrow a magic tool workshop.\nApparently, she wanted to make something top secret, and borrowing an entire workshop was no small matter.\nStill, as Count Anvard, Barney couldn't refuse Monica's, the Seven Sages' request, though he did demand proper compensation, as it irked him to help for free.\nWhat Monica was trying to make was no simple amulet with a magic formula embedded in a gemstone. It was an extremely advanced magic tool that required specialized equipment.\nAs one responsible for part of Ridill's magic tool industry, Barney was naturally very interested in this fascinating magic tool.\nSo it was only natural for Barney to visit out of curiosity, as the lord of the territory.\nIt's only right that I visit the workshop as the lord. And I brought pastries made by our renowned chef as a token of my appreciation for the workers. It's just what a benevolent lord would do… Of course, there was no deeper meaning behind it.\nConvincing himself of this, Barney opened the workshop door.\n\"Good day, Lady Everett. Is the development going smoothly? By the way, knowing you, you've probably been so engrossed in your research that you've forgotten to eat and sleep again. Luckily, I happen to have some pastries here, so let's take a break and have some tea…\"\n\"Hmm? Hmm? Hmm? That face looks kinda familiar…\"\nInside the workshop, Monica was hunched over a desk, furiously scribbling with a quill, while a red-haired man across from her was mixing chemicals. It was this man who responded to Barney.\nIt seemed to take Monica a few seconds to notice Barney, as she looked up from her papers.\n\"Ah, Barney, good aft——\"\n\"Monica, come here for a moment.\"\nBarney wordlessly beckoned Monica over with an expressionless face.\nMonica put down her quill, walked over to Barney, and tilted her head slightly. \"What's wrong?\"\nNothing was wrong, of course.\n\"Why is THAT Senior Dee here?!\"\n\"Um, I asked him to help make the magic tool… Could it be that Barney doesn't like Senior Dee?\"\n\"No one at Minerva likes that guy.\"\nHubert Dee, the nephew of the Artillery Magician of the Seven Sages, was infamous for randomly challenging students and teachers to magic duels.\nBack then, even Barney, a prodigy at Minerva, had been dragged into these duels and suffered on multiple occasions.\nAdjusting his askew glasses, Barney whispered to Monica.\n\"Besides, you didn't like that guy either, did you?\"\n\"W-well, yes, but… when it comes to making magic tools, Senior Dee is truly amazing.\"\nIt was true that Hubert Dee's genius in magic tool creation was well-known even when they were at Minerva.\nIf even Monica, one of the Seven Sages, acknowledged his skills, then his abilities must far surpass those of ordinary craftsmen.\nHowever, hearing Monica candidly praise Hubert did not sit well with Barney. To him, Monica was his rival.\nShe should be crying \"Barney, help me!\" while relying on him, and then laughing happily \"Thank you, Barney!\" after he helped her!\nAs Barney inwardly seethed, Monica frowned slightly and smiled wryly.\n\"But I'm glad you came, Barney… You see, there's something I need your help with.\"\n\"Well, of course, as a busy Count, I can't lend a hand in actually making the magic tool, but I'd be happy to offer my wisdom in handling the necessary procedures for manufacturing and patenting…\"\n\"I need your blood, Barney.\"\nBarney's glasses slid askew.\n\"…What did you just say?\"\n\"Well, you see, I need blood samples from various people, and I've already asked everyone in the workshop… But the more mana a person has, the easier it is to extract the mana particles from their blood. So I'd like some of your blood since you have a lot of mana.\"\n\"……\"\n\"I've already thoroughly examined mine and Senior Dee's blood samples…\"\nBarney raised his hand, intending to straighten his tilted glasses.\nBut before he could, a long arm reached from behind and firmly gripped his neck.\nThe unpleasant, humming voice in his ear belonged to none other than Hubert.\n\"mm-hmm, mm-hmm, blood sample donor… secured.\"\n\"Gah!?\"\nGrinning widely, Hubert ensnared Barney in a tight bear hug, his abnormally long arms and legs coiling around Barney like serpents, refusing to let go.\nIn front of the pale-faced Barney, Monica began heating a thin knife over a flame to draw blood.\n\"Um, Barney, don't move, okay? It'll just sting a little, and I'll squeeze out some blood.\"\n\"Gyaaaaaaahhhhh!!\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAfter having the tip of his left index finger sliced open by the dangerously clumsy Monica and having his blood extracted, an indignant Barney was applying a coagulating ointment to his wound.\n\"Really, since I provided my blood, you absolutely must complete that magic tool.\"\nDespite Barney's gruff demand, neither Monica nor Hubert paid him much heed.\n\"As expected, it's faster to get results from someone with a lot of mana.\"\n\"Mm-hmm, we gotta be able to extract mana particles even from tiny amounts of mana, or this won't be of any use.\"\n\"Yes, I'll work on improving the testing accuracy from here.\"\nMonica and Hubert seemed busy recording the test results of the blood-mixed chemical reagents.\nThe disgruntled Barney snorted and glanced over the scattered documents on the table.\nWhile not an expert on magic tools, Barney had studied the basics at Minerva.\nAbout 60% of the magic tools in circulation were \"amulets\" with magic formulas embedded in gemstones, mainly used by nobles as defensive talismans.\nHowever, with industrialization progressing, it had become common to incorporate magic tool technology into machinery and ships. In fact, Ridill was ahead of other countries in this field.\nAnd what Monica was trying to create would undoubtedly become a new trend in the magic tool industry.\nHowever, as the one providing the facilities, Barney had a few points to raise.\n\"This magic tool… its original purpose is to extract mana particles from blood, analyze them to study genetics, and establish early detection and treatment methods for hereditary diseases, is it not? Its current application seems to deviate somewhat from its original purpose.\"\nWithout stopping her work, Monica responded to Barney's remark.\n\"Yeah, I want to delve into the original purpose too, but there's not enough time for that in just two weeks… so right now, I just want to complete the most essential part.\"\nMonica was trying to create a tool to prove blood relations by applying this magic tool.\nHowever the way the test results would be presented did not sit well with Barney.\n\"This design is too wasteful, isn't it? Shouldn't the test results be displayed numerically? Why this method of…\"\nIn response to Barney's complaints, Hubert spoke up without stopping his work.\n\"It's to make the test results understandable even to idiots. Heheh, old folks especially will appreciate this kind of spectacle.\"\n\"Senior Dee's wording might be a bit crass, but… yes, I think presentation is important.\"\nBarney was surprised by her words.\nMonica had always focused on the substance of her research, disliking flowery language or flashy presentations.\nMoreover, even without embellishments, Monica's solid research had always been well-received.\n\"Emphasizing ‘presentation' is quite unlike you.\"\nAmused by Monica's change, Barney spoke in a slightly barbed tone, prompting a wry smile from her.\n\"…Yeah, you may be right… But it's fine. This isn't for an academic conference.\"\nIt seemed her time at Serendia Academy had changed Monica.\nInstead of simply conveying results plainly, she had likely learned that sometimes one must present their arguments skillfully to sway the masses.\n\"Um, what do they call it… ah yes, exaggeration. Exaggerating in front of a large audience.\"\nSaying this, Monica smiled a little shyly.",

      "content": "Time flew by quickly after the day Monica revealed her true identity in the student council room.\nMonica skipped classes to hole up in Count Anvard's workshop, working on the magic tool. In her free time, she returned to Serendia Academy to receive lessons from Bridget in the student council room.\nBridget's special training taught Monica how to conduct herself befitting one of the Seven Sages.\nIt was similar yet subtly different from the etiquette classes at Serendia Academy.\n\"At Serendia Academy, they teach ‘a lady should never put herself forward, but remain modest and gentle'. However, that is merely the conduct expected of a young noblewoman. So, you better consider the conduct required of one of the Seven Sages as separate.\"\nBridget declared this at the start of the training sessions.\nThe stage Monica would be performing on was the Supreme Council, which gathered the highest authorities of the Ridill Kingdom.\nThere, Monica would face skilled political players like Duke Crockford, so acting demurely like an exemplary lady would only get her devoured.\nMoreover, a petite, soft-spoken girl may be outright ignored. Even among the Seven Sages, the Silent Witch was often looked down upon simply for being a young woman.\n\"What's needed is a confident demeanor. If you want those around you to acknowledge you belong here… first, you must convince yourself that you belong.\"\n\"Y-Yes…\"\nFor Monica, who often felt out of place no matter where she went, Bridget's advice was difficult to follow.\nWhen Monica looked down doubtfully, Bridget used her fan to tilt Monica's chin up, showing no mercy despite knowing her identity as one of the Seven Sages.\n\"Nobles use every means possible to convince those around them that they belong——their speech, appearance, accessories, servants, connections, lineage, wealth… They utilize all these to have their worth acknowledged. So we too must employ every available means.\"\nOne such means was bearing and speech.\nAlthough Monica had improved in her stuttering lately, she still often trailed off or mumbled.\nThus, Bridget provided thorough guidance on voice projection and enunciation, while not neglecting to point out issues with Monica's posture and gait.\nAfter the training session reached a good stopping point, they took a short break. Elliot and Cyril returned to the student council room, both carrying stacks of documents.\n\"Got quite a few of those testimonies you requested. With this many, the council can't ignore them.\"\n\"Here's the revised strategy based on Claudia's advice. Check the details I've written on the maps.\"\nMonica quickly received the document bundles from the two and scanned through the contents.\nAt Monica's request, Elliot, Albert, Eliane, and other influential individuals at the academy had been gathering \"certain testimonies\" within the school grounds.\nWhile each testimony carried little weight individually, together they formed a powerful weapon. Monica alone could never have gathered so many testimonies.\nMeanwhile, she had asked Cyril and Claudia to thoroughly review the strategy, relay instructions to those who would take action on the day, and coordinate their efforts.\nThe Black Chalice was nearly complete, with Hubert providing the final touches.\n…I wouldn't have made it this far without everyone's help.\nAcknowledging this fact, Monica carefully reviewed each document one by one.\nThose around her had put in so much effort to reach this point. As such, Monica had to give her all in response.\nAt the Supreme Council, she would conduct herself confidently as the Silent Witch of the Seven Sages and emerge victorious.\nTo that end, there was something Monica desperately wanted.\n\"Um, Lord Cyril…\"\n\"What is it? Is there an issue with the plan?\"\n\"N-No, it's just… you see…\"\nMonica fidgeted with her fingers as she glanced upward at Cyril. After squirming for a while, she seemed to steel her resolve and spoke up.\n\"…On the day of the council meeting, to help me act confidently… c-could you give me… a good luck charm?\"\n\"A good luck charm?\"\nCyril looked perplexed, while beside him, Elliot clapped his hands together. \"Oh!\"\nHe then narrowed his droopy eyes and grinned slyly.\n\"You mean the festival hair ornament, right?\"\n\"Y-Yes, that's right.\"\nThe hair ornament she had received during the school festival had been carefully preserved as a dried flower, but it was so fragile that it might crumble if touched.\nThat's why Monica wanted a new \"good luck charm\"——a rose of the color of Cyril's hair, with a blue ribbon matching her own eyes.\n\"…If I had that, I feel like I could act as confidently as Lord Cyril, so…\"\nCyril averted his gaze awkwardly. When his wandering eyes met Elliot's sly grin, he cleared his throat uncomfortably.\n\"Understood. I'll have one prepared by the morning of that day.\"\n\"…! Thank you so much!\"\nMonica Norton will not be attending next year's school festival. So she had thought she would never receive another festival hair ornament.\nBut to be able to get one last ornament before leaving the academy, Monica felt so fortunate as she savored this small happiness.\nObserving this exchange between Cyril and Monica, Elliot leaned in and whispered to Bridget.\n\"Isn't that surprising? You're not going to say anything, Miss Bridget?\"\n\"…Say anything about what?\"\nBridget eyed Elliot while hiding her mouth behind her fan.\nElliot shrugged with a slightly mocking smile.\n\"I thought you'd scoff at the idea of a ‘good luck charm' as mere self-indulgence.\"\n\"I've said it many times——for the success of the mission, any means is acceptable. Besides…\"\nBridget trailed off, her gaze distant, as if reminiscing about something.\nWhen Elliot prompted, \"Besides?\", she simply said, \"It's nothing,\" and ended the conversation.\nBesides… receiving a hair ornament from one's beloved must be a joyful thing, no?\nWhen she closed her eyes, the image of a young prince offering her a rose made from his scarf resurfaced in her mind.\nNo doubt Monica had worn the same expression as herself back then.\nUnlike Bridget, who had realized her first love that day, Monica seemed completely oblivious.\nWhich brings more happiness——being aware of it, or remaining unaware?\nBridget did not know the right answer.\nHowever, she did know that even if love was unattainable, those memories could become priceless treasures.",

      "content": "On the morning of the Supreme Council meeting, Monica visited Lana's room.\n\"It's finally here. Have you been getting enough sleep and food?\"\n\"…Yeah.\"\nMonica nodded firmly at the rolled-up-sleeved Lana.\nDuring the preparation period before the Supreme Council, Isabelle and Agatha had strictly managed Monica's diet and sleep schedule.\nAgatha's efficiency in forcibly dragging Monica away from her work on the Black Chalice and putting her to bed was impressive enough to earn everyone's admiration.\nThanks to them, Monica could face the Supreme Council in top condition.\nTo attire Monica appropriately as one of the Seven Sages, Lana had prepared cosmetics, corsets, and other accessories.\nFirst, Lana had Monica wear a corset.\nUnlike the one worn under her dress at the school festival's dance, it lacked the boning to flare out the skirt… but the thick chest padding was extraordinary, meant to give her upper body more volume.\nOver this, she would wear the robe exclusive to the Seven Sages, which had also been extensively modified.\nThe robe given to Monica two years ago was made slightly larger in anticipation of her growth. However, since she had barely grown in these two years, the robe now dragged on the floor.\nDeclaring that such an oversized robe lacked dignity, Lana had the hem altered by a tailor to accentuate Monica's figure.\nAfter changing into the tailored robe, it was time for makeup——different from what Monica had worn at the chess tournament or school festival.\nOn Monica's youthful face with round eyes, a small nose and mouth, Lana swiftly applied makeup.\nHer eyes looked sharper and more intelligent. Her brows were dignified. Her lips were refined.\n\"…Today will be the last time you do my makeup for me, huh?\"\nAs Monica muttered while having her lips rouged, Lana pursed her own lips tightly.\n\"You're not attending the graduation ceremony?\"\n\"I probably… won't be able to.\"\n\"…I see.\"\nWhether their mission succeeded or failed, once everything was over, Monica Norton would have to leave Serendia Academy.\nNot only next year's school festival, but she would be unable to attend even the graduation party happening soon.\nHowever, Lana snorted through her nose and looked straight at Monica.\n\"It's just makeup though. Call me anytime, and I'll do it for you… We're friends, after all.\"\nMonica blushed slightly and nodded at Lana's added remark.\n\"…Yeah. But, I'll try to learn it myself… how to do… my own makeup too.\"\n\"When I start my own company, I plan to sell cosmetics too. Use our products then… I'll teach you how to use them properly.\"\nMonica smiled wryly at Lana's usual assertive tone.\nEven after learning Monica's true identity, Lana still treated her as a friend. Feeling grateful for this, Monica had to resist the urge to cry.\nNo, I can't cry or my makeup will be ruined.\nSuppressing her welling tears, Monica held out a white rose hair ornament to Lana, who was preparing to style her hair.\n\"Um, could you… put this on for me?\"\nLana examined the ornament and smiled warmly.\n\"Ah, this is from the school festival… I see, I see…\"\n\"…?\"\n\"Yup, leave it to me. I'll make you look absolutely lovely.\"\nNot understanding the reason for Lana's sly grin, Monica tilted her head and showed her another accessory she had brought.\n\"Also, I want to wear this too…\"\nLana's eyes widened at the accessory Monica presented.\nIt was probably surprising since Monica had never brought anything other than the hair ornament before.\n\"What a lovely necklace. A gift?\"\n\"…Yeah, from an important friend. I never had the courage to wear it before, but…\"\nIn Monica's hand swung a delicately designed necklace.\nDangling from the thin chain was a peridot stone closely resembling the color of Monica's eyes.\n\"I feel like, it was meant for this very moment.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nCradling his weeping daughter Leonora, Louis Miller felt utterly helpless.\nDespite thoroughly studying how to hold her comfortably, the adorable Leonora was scrunching up her face and screaming at the top of her lungs.\nShe had drunk plenty of milk and had her diaper changed just moments ago, appearing quite content until Louis picked her up, at which point she started bawling.\nWhen Louis silently offered Leonora to Lynn, she immediately stopped crying the moment Lynn took her in her arms.\n\"Why does she cry like the world is ending whenever I hold her?\"\n\"Perhaps to her, you resemble an evil demon king bent on destroying the world.\"\n\"………\"\nLouis wanted to protest, but his wife Rosalie was sleep-deprived from Leonora's night wakings and had just laid down for a nap. If he made Leonora cry further, it would disturb Rosalie's rest.\nWeighing his fatherly stubbornness against consideration for his wife, Louis ultimately gave up on holding Leonora today.\n\"Sir Louis, it's about time for you to leave. The carriage is waiting outside.\"\n\"If only I could fly there with magic, this would be so much less troublesome.\"\nBefore becoming one of the Seven Sages, when Louis was still a captain in the magic corps, he often used flight magic to travel to the castle.\nIt wasn't that far of a straight flight, and certainly faster than taking a carriage.\nHowever, as one of the Seven Sages, he was required to travel by carriage except in emergencies.\nMoreover, today was the Supreme Council meeting where the nation's top authorities would gather. Naturally, he had to maintain proper decorum.\n\"Well then, I'll be off. Don't wait for me to have dinner. I'll be late returning.\"\n\"Yes. Have a safe trip.\"\nLouis waved reluctantly at Leonora as he boarded the carriage.\nA young coachman wearing a hat closed the door and set the carriage in motion.\nWith nothing to occupy his hands, Louis rested his cheek on his fist and contemplated today's council meeting.\nThe trial of the criminal impersonating the Second Prince——indeed, that youth was certainly an imposter.\nHowever, if Louis's deductions were correct, the real and fake princes had been swapped not recently, but ten years ago. And that swap had been orchestrated by Duke Crockford…\nLouis was almost certain of this but regrettably lacked proof.\nThe cunning Duke Crockford had undoubtedly destroyed all evidence.\n…In that case, I have no choice but to accept the Duke's claims this time.\nBeing outmaneuvered was infuriating. Yet Duke Crockford would also suffer a significant blow by having to relinquish the highly valuable Second Prince.\nGoing forward, the Duke would likely forcefully install the Third Prince as the next king. However, compared to the Second Prince, the Third was younger and lacked notable achievements.\nThe succession struggle would only become more chaotic from here.\nAs Louis pondered how to counter Duke Crockford, he looked out the window and frowned slightly.\n…Oh?\nThe scenery outside looked different from the usual route.\nLouis called out to the coachman's back.\n\"Isn't this a different path than usual?\"\n\"Aye, the regular route's blocked by a stray cow, so we've no choice but to take the long way 'round today.\"\nOf all the inopportune times for this to happen.\nStill, they had ample time, and if they absolutely couldn't make it, Louis could always use flight magic. He quickly came to this conclusion.\nHowever, his thoughts began to change as he observed the passing scenery.\nThe carriage gradually left the town, entering a sparsely populated forest. While a detour, they could likely reach the castle by cutting through this forest.\nBut why choose the forest route when other detours were available?\n\"Stop the carriage.\"\n\"Why the sudden…?\"\nThe coachman showed no sign of stopping.\nLouis pointed his staff at the back of the coachman's neck and issued a low command.\n\"Stop.\"\nThe coachman finally halted the carriage.\nAt that moment, the surrounding atmosphere changed drastically——a vast mana pressure spreading out.\nA barrier meant for a magic duel had just been erected around this forest.\nThis is… a magic duel barrier?\nAs Louis's awareness was drawn to the barrier enveloping the forest, the coachman snapped his fingers. Simultaneously, a flaming arrow soared straight at Louis. There was no time to chant a defensive barrier.\nLouis swiftly leaped from the carriage, evading the flaming arrow. Then a massive fireball came hurtling from another direction.\nThe flaming arrow and fireball had been cast by separate individuals, Louis calmly deduced as he chanted an abbreviated defensive barrier.\nHaving started the chant while leaping from the carriage, Louis managed to properly deflect the fireball with his barrier.\nThough the barrier had cracked from that single fireball strike.\nLouis's hasty defensive barrier had been cast through an abbreviated chant.\nYet it was a barrier raised by the Barrier Magician, renowned for formidable defenses. It should not have cracked from such an ordinary spell.\nThis powerful spell…\nLouis rose to his feet, brushing off his soiled clothes, and spoke.\n\"If you come out and beg for your lives right now, I'll show mercy by merely tying you up and dangling you upside-down from the mansion's roof… Glenn.\"\nLouis's sharp ears did not miss the faint \"Hiiih!\" voice.\nTowards the bush from where the sound had come, Louis mercilessly fired a lightning bolt.\nHowever, a defensive barrier immediately blocked Louis's attack spell.\nThe one who had raised the barrier was the coachman——a lanky man with long, spindly limbs. Discarding his hat revealed short red hair.\n\"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, your stealth skills are too poor to even mention.\"\n\"Sh-Shut up! I just let out a tiny noise!\"\nEmerging noisily from the bushes was Louis's disciple, Glenn Dudley.\nAnd the red-haired man disguised as the coachman… though unfamiliar, Louis recognized him as the one who had fought Glenn in a magic duel at Serendia Academy——Hubert Dee.\nWhy had Hubert, posing as a coachman, brought Louis to this forest? Why had Glenn attacked him?\nWhile puzzling over these questions, observing the magic duel barrier erected across the entire forest made the mastermind obvious.\n\"Such an intricate barrier… I see, the work of the Silent Witch, huh.\"\nGlenn's face visibly tensed, making his foolishness apparent.\nLouis graced his idiotic disciple with a beautiful smile.\n\"Now then, you two. Are you prepared to kneel, beg for your lives, and confess everything?\"\nSpeaking with a gentle, priestlike voice while exuding murderous intent, Louis caused Glenn to audibly gulp.\n\"M-Master… I-I won't let you pass here! This is a challenge!\"\nBeside the shouting Glenn, Hubert grinned gleefully.\n\"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, I wonder if you can entertain me for a while, Lord Barrier Magician.\"\nFacing the two defiant youths, Louis sighed wearily and slowly shook his head.\n\"What a predicament. I don't have a habit of bullying the weak, so…\"\n——This does not constitute bullying the weak.\nLouis flicked his braided chestnut hair behind his back and tapped his shoulder with his staff.\nHis ashen violet eyes, visible through his monocle, glared at Glenn and Hubert as a vicious grin spread across his exquisite features that could captivate anyone.\nThe mouth that usually wove elegant words licked its lips and issued a low growl.\n\"It's time for punishment, you brats.\"",

      "content": "There is a small magic circle set up on a high ground overlooking the forest that the carriage carrying Louis Miller entered. At the center of the magic circle, a crystal ball is placed, displaying the situation inside the forest.\nSurrounding the magic circle are Monica Everett, the Silent Witch, Cyril Ashley, and Neil Clay Maywood, the three of them.\nIn the crystal ball, the carriage carrying Louis Miller has just stopped.\nAt that time, Monica touched her staff to the magic circle and activated the magic without chanting.\nThe magic circle then instantly shines brightly white, and in response, the entire forest below the high ground is enveloped in a faint light.\n\"… I've activated a magic duel barrier. Please maintain the barrier.\"\nAt Monica's words, Cyril and Neil nod and send their mana into the barrier.\nIt is said that a magic duel barrier usually requires two high-ranking magicians to activate and maintain it.\nIn fact, what makes it difficult to set up such a barrier is the complexity, while maintaining only requires a certain amount of mana.\nIn this case, Monica performs the complex activation of the barrier alone, and then Cyril and Neil take over maintaining it afterward.\nIn the crystal ball, the magic duel has already begun.\nWatching the flashy eruption of flames, Neil gulped.\n\"…The operation to delay him has begun,\" Neil mutters in a firm voice.\n\"Ah,\" Cyril nods in a low voice.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nRegarding the battle against Duke Crockford, there was someone Monica absolutely wanted to keep away from the Supreme Council's assembly.\nThat person was Louis Miller, the Barrier Magician.\n\"I want you to delay… Louis so that… he cannot attend… the assembly.\"\nTwo weeks ago, after revealing her true identity, Monica said this at the strategy meeting.\nThe one who objected was Glenn, Louis' disciple.\n\"Master is in the First Prince's faction, an enemy of Duke Crockford, right? If we explain the situation to him, he might join our side…\"\n\"No.\"\nMonica shook her head sideways and firmly denied it.\n\"For Louis to join us, we would have to tell him the whole truth. But if he knew the truth from ten years ago…I think Louis would choose to reveal everything publicly.\"\nThe fact that the real Prince Felix died ten years ago. And that the culprits were Duke Crockford and his servant, Isaac Walker.\nIf Louis knew these facts, he would happily reveal the truth without hesitation. By doing so, he could definitively put an end to Duke Crockford and the fake Second Prince.\n\"Louis has no reason to help the ‘Student Council President'…so it's impossible for him to cooperate with this operation.\"\nEven if Monica and Glenn were to plead with him and appeal to his conscience, Louis would choose to reveal the truth. Louis is the kind of person who can make that choice.\nIn political struggles, \"the enemy of my enemy is not always my friend.\"\nMoreover, Louis is perceptive and eloquent. If Louis were present at the Supreme Council assembly, there was a possibility that he would see through what Monica was trying to do and refute her.\nFor Monica to be able to concentrate on confronting Duke Crockford at the Supreme Council assembly, having Louis there would definitely be inconvenient.\n\"Master is scary as an ally, but he's a hundred times scarier as an enemy…\"\nGlenn's mutter makes Monica nod deeply in agreement. Honestly, she would have little chance of winning a debate against him.\n\"So, on the day of the assembly, I want to delay Louis… with a magic duel.\"\n\"A magic duel?\" It was the Third Prince Albert who voiced his doubt.\n\"Why would you purposefully challenge the Barrier Magician of the Seven Sages to a magic duel? In the barrier of magic duel, physical attacks become ineffective, don't they? It's a bit of an unpleasant way to put it, but wouldn't it be better to set up some kind of physical trap instead…\"\n\"It's the opposite.\"\n\"It's the opposite.\"\nMonica's and Glenn's voices overlapped as they denied Albert's words.\nGlenn, who knows Louis' fighting style well, argues seriously,\n\"Master says, ‘If you want to defeat an enemy, punching them is faster than using magic'.\"\nAs everyone struggled to comment, Monica also nodded with a straight face.\n\"Louis is strong at both physical combat and magic, so unless we can at least block physical attacks, we have no chance of winning.\"\nOnce, in the Seven Sages' selection magic duel, Monica defeated Louis. However, if that had been a real battle, Monica would undoubtedly have lost.\nIn one-on-one combat, Louis prefers a fighting style where he blinds the enemy with magic to close the distance and then knocks them down with his bare hands.\nFor those accustomed to fighting with magic, fists and kicks flying at them without chanting are extremely threatening.\n\"And Master will use any means to win! He'll pull out all the stops!\"\n\"In a battlefield with physical attacks allowed, it's Louis' home-field advantage. I, I've seen Louis beat down the magic corps troops with his bare hands and leave them piled up in the training grounds…\"\n\"And when Master is in the middle of a fistfight, his mood gets a little…erratic! Like his blood is boiling!\"\n\"That's right! His laugh! It's scary!\"\n\"Master usually uses his staff when beating up anyone who pisses him off!\"\n\"That's why using a magic duel barrier that nullifies physical attacks is absolutely, absolutely necessary!\"\nThe two become more and more heated in their voices, pressuring everyone present.\nFor most of those here, their impression of the Barrier Magician Louis Miller is that of a handsome man who is popular among the women of high society due to his princely demeanor.\nMonica and Glenn's shouts, which completely shatter this princely image of Louis Miller, were filled with too much genuine experience to simply laugh off as \"exaggeration\".\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThe crystal ball displaying the situation inside the magic duel barrier showed flames from spells flying back and forth.\nIt goes without saying that Louis' magic was outstanding, but his disciple Glenn also possessed a massive mana. An ordinary barrier would be destroyed by a single fireball with the force he can muster.\nHowever, even when struck by such stray fireballs, the magic duel barrier set up by Monica remained completely unshaken.\nCyril, entrusted with maintaining the barrier, sent his mana into it as he marveled at its meticulous construction.\nThe magic duel barrier was extremely complex and advanced. It's not something that can be made in just a day or two, he has heard.\nEven during the magic duel incident at the academy, it took three days just to adjust an existing barrier.\nYet Monica completed this barrier in just a few dozen minutes. Most of the time was spent drawing the magic circle itself. Constructing the magic itself took merely an instant. And a chantless one, too.\nIt makes Cyril realize anew, that the person standing before him is the real Silent Witch.\nLast autumn, this hooded magician stopped Cyril's mana from going out of control.\nCyril had thought of that magician as a terrifyingly silent and terrifyingly powerful, inhuman monster.\nBut that magician had always been by Cyril's side.\nPlodding over with a dull, clumsy gait, fidgeting her small hands, shyly smiling and saying, \"Lord… Cyril…\"\n\"Then, I will… head to the castle.\"\nWith those words, Monica stepped away from the magic circle.\nFrom now on, Monica, as one of the Seven Sages, the Silent Witch, will be facing Duke Crockford and helping a young man named Isaac Walker at the Supreme Council assembly.\nRight now, Monica was wearing the robe that only the Seven Sages were permitted to wear.\nWith her makeup done and her hair beautifully tied up, her appearance was completely different from her usual self. And yet…\n\"Lord Cyril, thank you… for the flowers.\"\nHer sheepish smile, with her brows furrowed, was no different from the Monica Norton that Cyril knows.\nShy, socially awkward, clumsy, crybaby, lacking in self-confidence, yet her eyes change color when numbers are involved… Everything Cyril has seen of \"Monica Norton\" was not just an act.\nCyril cleared his throat and stated with the demeanor of the Student Council Vice President, \"Give it everything you've got.\"\n\"…Yes!\"\nMonica nodded, wearing the biggest smile Cyril had ever seen from her.",

      "content": "Louis unleashed widespread bolts of lightning through a shortened incantation.\nGlenn and Hubert avoided them with flight magic, each firing a fireball and flaming arrows respectively. However, Louis effortlessly blocked the attacks from both with a simultaneously deployed defensive barrier.\nAs one who calls himself the Barrier Magician, his defensive barriers are indeed sturdy.\nThe strength of defensive barriers was greatly influenced by the magician's mana capacity. For ordinary magicians, while a barrier can block an attack once, it becomes fragile and shatters, but the strength of Louis's barrier was on another level.\nGlenn's fireball barely caused a crack. Hubert's flaming arrows, focusing on rapid firing at the cost of power, would need to hit around thirty times to destroy the barrier.\n\"Mm-hmm-hmm-hmm.\"\nHubert pondered while evading Louis's attack magic.\nWhile Louis cannot unleash spells as swiftly as the non-incanting Monica, his shortened incantations were still threateningly fast.\nMoreover, the power packed in his magic was quite formidable. Inferior to Hubert's uncle the Artillery Magician, but far exceeding most high-ranking magicians. Perhaps, Hubert's barrier could barely withstand one of his attacks.\nSlower and less accurate than Monica, but better than my uncle. Weaker than my uncle in power, but stronger than Monica…I see, with no particular weakness, he has no openings.\nThere are typically two kinds of defensive barriers: a flat shield-like plane, or a hemisphere enclosing the caster.\nPlanar barriers have the merits of lower mana consumption, ease of creating sturdy barriers, and unhindered movement while deployed.\nHemispherical barriers, on the other hand, consume substantial mana, tend to be thin, and hinder movement, but can counter attacks from any angle.\nThe cowardly Monica primarily uses hemispheric barriers, rarely moving in combat, and is poor at perceiving attacks from multiple directions.\nIn contrast, Louis Miller excelled in handling planar barriers with exquisite precision. By activating barriers accurately timed and angled to the enemy's attacks, there is no waste, and he can move swiftly via flight magic.\nIn short, Louis is overwhelmingly experienced in combat.\nMeanwhile, while Hubert can use barriers, they lack the strength to withstand many of Louis's attacks. Glenn cannot even use barriers, leaving only evasion through flight magic.\n\"Mm-hmm… I'll use my flight magic.\"\n\"Got it!\"\nFeigning evasion of Louis's attacks via flight magic, Hubert and Glenn gradually lure him deeper into the densely forested area with poor visibility.\nIn terrain with many obstacles, high speeds cannot be achieved through flight. Extremely disadvantageous for Glenn, inept at delicate magic control, though less so for Hubert.\nThey lured Louis there because they had set a trap.\nAs Louis pursues while flying and incanting an attack spell, a water spear forms in his hand.\nMagicians can typically only use two spells simultaneously. Currently, Louis cast flight and attack magic——meaning he cannot cast another defensive barrier.\n\"Mm-hmm… he's here!\"\nAt Hubert's snap, the trap magic tools he had planted around them activate.\nFlames converged on Louis from all directions——an unavoidable fatal strike with a mere water spear as a defense.\nYet Louis remained unfazed, crushing the water spear in his hand. The water then transformed into spiderweb-like strands spreading outward.\nThe supposed attack was actually a defensive spell, the water strands intercepting and vaporizing the incoming flames.\nLouis canceled his flight magic and waved his staff with his left hand.\nCountless ice arrows rained down, destroying every last magic tool Hubert had prepared in the forest without a trace.\n\"I was the one who cast the barrier during the previous magic duel at Serendia Academy. Naturally, I witnessed that entire magic duel.\"\nIn other words, he was fully aware of Hubert's tactics using magic tools as traps.\nLouis adjusts his slightly askew monocle with a fingertip, maintaining an elegant smile.\n\"I hear you enjoy hunting, Hubert Dee? Well, I too indulge in a bit of dragon hunting myself.\"\nWith a brief incantation and staff swing, Louis created a hemispherical barrier enclosing Hubert and Glenn——not to defend against outside attacks, but to confine them inside.\nLouis's lips curled into a sinister grin.\n\"But dragons, despite their hulking size, are surprisingly swift. So to prevent their escape, I confine them within a barrier and unleash my full onslaught of attack magic… like this.\"\nAs Louis raises his staff to begin incantation, intending to bombard the imprisoned Hubert and Glenn with his full might, at that very moment…\nFrom behind Louis emerged Roberto Vinkel, gripping a magic sword, silently lunging to strike.\n——\n‘ There's no way to defeat Louis head-on. We need to catch him off guard.'\nThis was what Monica said during their strategy meeting.\nPerhaps Monica alone could win through direct confrontation with her skill and mana.\nBut for Hubert and the others who were inferior in both areas, setting traps to create an opening for Louis was their only chance at victory.\nThe deployed magic tool traps were all meant to create that opportunity for Roberto's attack.\nRoberto's strike, top in swordsmanship class, was quiet and without waste——a fleeting instant difficult to evade even for skilled warriors.\nYet, Louis Miller casually swung his staff behind him to parry it.\n\"W, What!?\"\nRoberto tries to push further, but Louis's staff doesn't budge an inch.\nThe moment Roberto pulled back his sword for a second strike, Louis's staff flicked up, entangling the sword.\nWithout hesitation, Louis then released his staff and struck Roberto's abdomen with his palm.\nMaybe physical attacks won't work on them within the magic battle barrier, but coating his palm with mana was another matter.\nIn essence, Louis coated his palm with a miniature defensive barrier and struck Roberto with it——an utterly primitive tactic unheard of among magicians.\nRoberto was blown away, coughing out a wad of air as he tumbled along the ground.\nLouis elegantly brushed off his hands with a radiant, ever-beautiful smile.\n\"I told you, didn't I? I watched your magic duel… you didn't think I'd be oblivious to a lurking ambush?\"\nLouis kicked his dropped staff into the air with his toes and caught it, then gently patted his palm with the end——a gesture reminiscent of a torturer wielding a whip, permeated by an ominous, murderous aura.\nTrapped within the barrier, Glenn trembled in terror and thrust out his hand.\n\"U, uwaaaaaaaaah!!\"\nStraining every last drop of his mana, Glenn fired a fireball at the barrier confining them.\nUpon impact, Glenn's fireballs burst and scattered flames over the area. This naturally triggered a small explosion within the barrier, injuring Glenn and Hubert.\nWhile magic attacks cannot physically harm in a magic duel, they still felt pain proportional to damage taken, which depleted their mana reserves. Searing agony as if scorched by fire overwhelmed Glenn and Hubert, drastically draining their mana.\nStill, Glenn's fireball managed to destroy Louis's confining barrier.\nWith a click of his tongue, Louis turned his attention behind him. Just as Roberto retrieved his magic sword and charged, Louis parried with his staff.\nSeizing that chance, Glenn and Hubert cast flight magic with their dwindling mana reserves.\nAs Hubert unleashed flaming arrows at Louis, blocked by his defensive barrier, Glenn grabbed Roberto and ascended out of Louis's reach.\n\"We're retreating for now! Ugh… so… heavy!!\"\nWith flushed cheeks, Glenn fleed while carrying the dangling Roberto away. Hubert also escaped while Louis was focused on Glenn.\nClicking his tongue, Louis cast flight magic. Though he's lost sight of Hubert Dee, the wobbling Glenn carrying Roberto was an easy target to quickly catch up to.\nWell then, time to quickly crush those brats and force the Silent Witch's scheme out of them before reporting to the Supreme Council.",

      "content": "\"…We'll lose for sure.\"\nThat was Claudia Ashley's assessment after hearing the outline of the Louis Miller Stalling Operation.\nThe first stage of the Stalling Operation was for Hubert to disguise himself as a servant and lure Louis into the forest, where Glenn would ambush him with magic.\nIf that failed, they would lure him into an area trapped with Hubert's magic tools and ambush him with the traps.\nThe last resort if all else failed was an ambush by Roberto, who was lying in wait.\nIt was a three-layered ambush operation against Louis, but Claudia bluntly dismissed it, slumping back in her chair as if saying she couldn't go through with it. Glenn's mood soured at Claudia's attitude.\n\"But I put a lot of thought into that plan, what's wrong with it?\"\n\"…Do you really think you can defeat your master with that plan?\"\nGlenn was rendered speechless.\nShe thought the plan was well-made. After all, it was a three-layered ambush.\nYet, Glenn just couldn't envision herself defeating his own master.\nAs Glenn fell silent, Claudia rested her cheek on her hand and tapped the map with the operation details with her finger.\n\"…All those plans are just rehashes… Hubert Dee's magic tool traps, Roberto Vinkel's ambush… I'm certain Barrier Magician have witnessed both during the recent magic duel.\"\nClaudia was right. Louis, who was in charge of maintaining the barrier during the magic duel at Serendia Academy, had seen everything that took place there.\nAs everyone fell silent, Cyril raised his hand.\n\"Then I'll take on the Stalling Operation…\"\nNeil shook his head at Cyril's suggestion.\n\"That's not good, Vice President. That would leave us short-handed for maintaining the magic duel barrier.\"\n\"…Ngh.\"\nMaintaining the magic duel barrier required at least two mages. Of those present, Cyril had the most mana and proficiency in manipulating it, so he couldn't be spared from barrier maintenance duty.\nGlenn had been nodding with his arms crossed, but then he clapped his hands together.\n\"Then, we could increase the number of magic tool traps…!\"\n\"Mm-hmm-mm-hmm, All my hands were already full on making the ‘Black Chalice,' so I don't have any leeway to make more magic tools.\"\n\"Ughh…\"\nAs no one could come up with a good plan and everyone held their heads, Monica pointed to a spot on the map.\n\"…What about setting a trap here?\"\nMonica then explained the specifics of the trap.\nClaudia slowly raised her listless face and looked at Monica.\n\"…Do you even capable creating of something like that?\"\n\"No, this trap is not something that I can create with my own… that's why—\"\nMonica paused for a moment, then continued with a slightly embarrassed expression.\n\"—I will borrow the power of a ‘friend.'\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nRoberto Vinkel saw himself as a pawn in the game of chess.\nThe weakest piece that only moves straight forward on the battlefield. However, it's by skillfully maneuvering the pawns and manipulating the enemy's pieces that one can achieve victory in chess.\nRoberto was currently standing in a small clearing amidst the forest. Glenn and Hubert were already lying in ambush around the area.\n\"I see. This time you'll be my opponent, while the remaining two provide support.\"\nParting the foliage appeared the Barrier Magician, Louis Miller.\nThe slender man in a robe exuded an elegance that could make him seem beautiful were he silent. Just standing in the flower field made him look like a painting.\nHowever, the killing intent emanating from his entire being was, to put it mildly, abnormal.\n\"It's Roberto Vinkel. Here I come.\"\nAs Roberto channeled his magic into the hilt he gripped, it crackled and glowed, forming a blade of lightning.\n\"Haaah!\"\nAs Roberto lunged forward swinging his sword, Louis parried the ethereal blade of magic with his staff.\nAn ordinary sword would pass through the iron blade to strike the opponent's body, but Louis parried the lightning blade with his staff like before, likely he did it by channeling his mana into it. Direct strikes with the lightning blade would be needed to injure Louis' body.\nRoberto was careful not to be deflected as he changed the angle and swung upwards from below. Louis stepped back to avoid it and thrust the tip of his staff at Roberto's throat.\nRoberto barely dodged it when flames arrows and fireballs came flying from the shadows of the trees——supports from Hubert and Glenn.\nHowever, Louis seemed to have anticipated this, raising a barrier to block the magic attacks. He then charged at Roberto as if nothing had happened.\nAs Roberto dodged the staff swung down from above, Louis drove the end of the swinging staff into the ground, nimbly leaping up without using any flight magic.\nThe airborne Louis, propelled solely by his staff and leg strength, then kicked the side of his boot into Roberto's temple.\n\"Gu, ughh!?\"\nIn the magic duel, physical attacks were supposed to not leave any damage… but just like with his earlier palm strike, Louis had formed a small barrier on the side of his boot to allow the attack to be effective.\nMonica had insisted that they couldn't win without sealing physical attacks, but who could have imagined a magician, let alone one of the Seven Sages, punching, kicking, and drop-kicking like this?\nRolling on the ground from the temple kick, Roberto was assailed by a follow-up knee strike from Louis, who seemed intent on shattering his face with the furious blow. Roberto frantically leaped back to avoid it.\nOnce again, long-range support attacks came from Glenn and Hubert…but the airborne magic was effortlessly blocked by Louis' rapidly chanted defensive barriers.\nHe's so formidable.\nLouis had perceptive eyes to see through enemy traps, excelled at offense and defense, and possessed high mobility.\nThe Barrier Magician Louis Miller's second-place record for solo dragon slaying in the Ridill Kingdom was no fluke.\nYes, if comparing him to a chess piece, he would be the strongest piece…\n\"You're like a Queen.\"\nLouis' cheek twitched slightly.\n\"…What did you just say?\"\n\"You're like a Queen, I said.\"\nAt that moment, the killing intent emanating from Louis intensified noticeably. Roberto's exposed forearms began to break out in goosebumps.\n\"…huh?\"\nThe response came in an unusually low, ominous tone.\nThe expression drained from Louis' pale face. Blue veins bulged at his temples.\n\"Allow me to enlighten you one thing, Roberto Vinkel… I absolutely detest being compared to a woman.\"\nWhile Roberto hadn't intended to mock Louis' feminine appearance, his words seemed to have struck his nerve.\nWith a wave of his staff and a brief incantation, Louis summoned a strong gust that scattered the flowers in the field.\nThe beautifully swirling petals concealed countless wind blades descending upon Roberto.\nWhile wind magic has low power, its invisibility makes it difficult to evade. Roberto tracked the movements of the soaring petals to dodge the wind blades, but couldn't avoid them all as several cut into his body. There were no physical wounds, but he felt intense pain and a loss of mana.\nHe was nearing his limit.\n…just, five more steps.\nThis battle was like chess.\nThe pawn dashes across the flower field to maneuver the queen into the desired position.\n\"UUUUOOOOOOH!\"\n\"Well, well, are you resigning yourself?\"\nMore wind blades rained down on Roberto. Bracing for the damage, he charged at Louis, swinging his magic sword.\nJudging the wind blades alone couldn't finish Roberto, Louis leaped back to avoid the slashing attack.\nJust, three more steps.\nSwinging his aching arm, Roberto poured his mana into the sword.\nThe lightning blade, amplified by Roberto's magic, nearly doubled in length, closing in on Louis.\nBut just before it could connect, Louis sidestepped with a mocking smile.\n\"Randall's signature magic sword… unfortunately, it's not the first time I've seen it. I've anticipated your extending sword.\"\nJust, one, more, step!\nRoberto poured every last bit of his magic into the sword.\nExtending the magic sword looks simple, but in reality consumes an enormous amount of mana. Furthermore, it destabilizes the sword itself, providing little benefit.\nStill, Roberto extended the sword by just the length of one of his arm joints.\nThe magic sword could now reach Louis. With an expression as if watching a fool's futile effort, Louis raised his staff to parry the sword.\n\"UUUUOOOOOOOHHHHHHHH!\"\nRoaring, Roberto swung down the sword with every ounce of his strength. Pressed by his desperate force, Louis was forced to take one step back.\n——At that moment, a brilliant purple glow shone forth from beneath Louis' feet.\nConfirming this, Roberto muttered,\n\"Checkmate.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nLouis Miller looked down at the glow beneath his feet, furrowing his brow.\nIt was a magic circle etched on the ground… but this was not a magic trap.\nIf it only contained standard magic formulas, Louis could instantly decipher it. But he could barely make out half of what was inscribed under his feet.\n…Could this be…a curse?\nThe moment he realized it, a tingling heat spread across the back of his right hand. Quickly removing his glove, a purple curse mark had appeared on the back of his hand. It seemed stepping on the magic circle triggered a curse trap.\nBefore entering the flower field, Louis had used a detection spell to scan for any magic tools. Yet he failed to notice this curse trap, likely because the curse itself was so feeble.\nYes, it was a weak curse that would dissipate within a few tens of minutes. It's also not something that would restrict Louis' abilities.\nJust what kind of curse is this…?\nThen Louis' ears picked up a buzzing sound——the fluttering of insect wings. Looking up, he saw swarms of insects taking flight from all across the flower field, converging on him.\nIt was then that Louis finally grasped the nature of the curse afflicting him.\n——This was an insect-beckoning curse.\nLouis instantly erected a hemispheric barrier around himself. The barrier went up just in time to block the swarming insects, leaving it blackened by their numbers.\nThe sight of the colorful insects clouding the barrier was eerie. Still, it was better than being directly swarmed, and Louis let out a relieved breath. But then he paled at the sensation under his feet.\nThe hemispheric barrier only enclosed the area around Louis' body. It did not extend all the way to the ground.\nWith a stricken look, Louis glanced down to see insects crawling up and over his boots.\nHe could use flight magic to escape the insects crawling from the ground. However, he could not use flight magic while maintaining the barrier.\n\"———!!!!!\"\nTrapped amidst the swarming insects in the center of the flower field, the Barrier Magician Louis Miller let out a soundless scream.",

      "content": "In the venue of the Supreme Council, nobles of renowned status lined up, waiting for the council to begin in their respective seats.\nSome seats were still unfilled, and those already seated exchanged opinions in hushed tones about this incident.\nTheir gazes fell upon Darius Knightley, the Duke Crockford.\nNo one could easily believe this horrific national crisis——that the Second Prince had been murdered and replaced by an impostor… as they furtively watched for the Duke's reaction.\nThe Duke Crockford waited for the council to start with his usual demeanor.\nAmid this, Raul Rosenberg the Thorn Witch seated among the Seven Sages, tugged at the robe of his neighbor, Ray Albright the Abyss Shaman.\n\"Seems like your curse has been triggered, Ray.\"\nSaying this, Raul covered his right ear with his hand, mimicking concentration to catch something.\n\"…Yeah, yeah…Looks like it's been settled. Well, I guess we really did a number on that Barrier Magician, huh.\"\n\"Serves him right, that pretty boy Louis Miller… All handsome men should be gobbled up by bugs…\"\nThe final trap set for restraining Louis Miller was the work of these two.\nRay had cast an insect-luring curse, while Raul had sneaked in special flowers that drained the mana of anyone who touched the flowerbed. Just being in that flowerbed would deplete one's mana.\nThat's why Glenn and Hubert provided support from outside the flowerbed. At this point, with the barrier preventing insect entry, Louis would simply run out of mana.\nFurthermore, Raul had cast a sound-amplifying spell on the flowerbed's flowers to eavesdrop, but hearing only the incessant buzzing of insects and Louis' curses, he dispelled it.\n\"Barrier Magician won't be coming this way for a while. Just like Monica's plan!\"\nMuttering this, Raul glanced sidelong at the empty seat next to him.\nWith the death of Emanuel Darwin, the Jeweled Magician, one of the Seven Sages' seats was vacant, leaving six.\nOf those, only the Thorn Witch, Abyss Shaman, and Artillery Magician were seated.\nThe seats of the Star Oracle Witch, Barrier Magician, and Silent Witch remained empty.\nRaul knew Louis was restrained, and that Monica had preparations, but he wondered what the Star Oracle Witch was up to.\n\"She probably got caught up in star-gazing again and overslept.\"\nAs Raul muttered under his breath, the sharp-eared Artillery Magician interjected.\n\"If you're looking for Star Oracle, I saw her head to the Azure Heavenly Palace this morning.\"\nThe Azure Heavenly Palace——the very building where the King's private quarters were located.\nThe thought that crossed Raul's mind was correct.\nSoon, the bell announcing the council's start rang out, and the hall doors opened to reveal Mary Harvey the Star Oracle Witch——a beautiful woman with gently waving silver hair, supporting Ambrose Crydel Ridill, the golden-haired, crowned King of Ridill in his sixties.\nThe King's appearance from his sickbed caused a stir in the hall.\nThe King's face was pale, leaning on a cane, but he stood upright with a straight back.\nWith pale golden hair, azure eyes, and a slender frame, he may have lost his youthful vigor, but the gleam in his intellectual eyes remained undimmed.\nThe Star Oracle Witch supporting the King declared in a beautiful, tinkling voice,\n\"Please be silent. Unrefined voices will strain His Majesty's health.\"\nAt the words of the eldest of the Seven Sages, the Star Oracle Witch, the hall fell silent.\nStill, everyone looked like they had something to say——the bedridden King had appeared in public for the first time in months.\n\"His Majesty has been deeply distressed by this recent upheaval and has graced us with his presence here. I ask for your understanding and consideration.\"\nSaying this, the Star Oracle Witch guided the King to his seat.\nThe nobles in attendance could not hide their turmoil, but one person remained unfazed – the Duke Crockford. One could only wonder what he was thinking.\nAmidst the swirling undercurrents, the council president opened his mouth.\n\"Well then, though there seem to be a few empty seats… let the Supreme Council commence.\"\nFrom the back door, a young man flanked by soldiers in shackles was brought forth.\nWith honey-blonde hair and handsome features, the criminal——who had impersonated the late Prince Felix Ark Ridill——strangely had an unnaturally serene expression.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"Criminal, first declare your name.\"\nPrompted by the senate, Isaac let a faint smile emerge.\nIsaac Walker was a man who had died ten years ago. There was no need to give a dead man's name here.\n\"I do not have a name to declare in this place. Please, call me by a number or symbol, whichever you prefer.\"\nHis insolent attitude caused everyone to contort their faces in displeasure.\nIsaac moved only his eyes, surveying the faces of those present——all familiar national leaders… and in the very back, the King, Felix's father.\nBeside him sat the First Prince Lionel and the Duke Crockford.\nShifting his gaze further, Isaac noticed two empty seats among the Seven Sages and narrowed his eyes slightly.\nOne was the seat of the Silent Witch. It was not unusual for her to be absent, as she rarely showed herself in public.\nBut if he could, he wished to meet her one last time——or rather, to see her true face.\nPerhaps that wish was too extravagant for a criminal.\nMocking himself inwardly, Isaac raised his head and looked straight ahead.\nWith Felix's face, he wore the same smile as Felix.\nThis was Felix's face. So he did not wish to leave people with the memory of an unsightly, frantic visage.\nEven if he was an impostor, he wanted people to remember Felix's beautiful appearance to the very end.\n\"Criminal. You killed and replaced the Second Prince Felix Ark Ridill on his way back to Serendia Academy after the New Year's Ceremony. Are there no inaccuracies in this statement of facts?\"\n\"If you say it is the truth, then surely it must be so.\"\nIsaac was prepared to be executed. But being too readily affirmative might raise suspicion.\nHowever, he had no intention of making an unsightly scene denying it either. For Isaac was to be executed, so there was no reason to deny his crime.\nWhen Isaac calmly responded, Duke Crockford's entourage stirred restlessly, deeming it insolent——not knowing who had created this impostor, directing their malice at the false Second Prince.\nHow ridiculous. Each and every one of them was being played by Duke Crockford.\n…Though the greatest jester is none other than myself.\nWhen Isaac was executed, the entire nation's people would direct their hatred at the criminal who murdered the heroic prince who saved them from the Cursed Dragon.\nAnd the heroic prince would be remembered tragically by the people.\nAh, but… I wonder what face she will make.\nSuddenly, the image of a girl hunched over a chessboard crossed his mind.\n——\"I didn't know what to do when I learned that Dad died for someone else's wish.\"\nMonica Norton… no, her real name must be Monica Rayne.\nThe daughter whose father was killed conceals the truth about the fake prince.\n…I wish she'd hate me for this.\nKind-hearted as she was, she may not bring herself to hate anyone.\nBut rather than make that terribly sad face, he wished she would hate Isaac fully, and at the moment of his execution, feel some sense of her father's enemy being gone. She had that right.\n\"Criminal, do you admit to all the crimes listed here?\"\nThe listed crimes alone were not enough, Isaac muttered inwardly.\nFor Isaac's crimes began the very moment the real Felix Ark Ridill was killed, ten years ago.\nSo Isaac answered,\n\"I admit to all crimes.\"\nThe crime of killing Felix. The crime of disposing of his body and impersonating him. The crime of deceiving many people… The crime of causing Monica's father's death.\nIsaac would shoulder them all and die here today.\nHe heard the sound of a door opening behind him. Soldiers must be coming to take him away, Isaac thought, but then a familiar voice reached his ears.\n\"Please, hold on the trial for a moment.\"\nIt was a voice he was familiar with, yet could not recognize.\nIsaac knew that voice. But its owner did not usually speak in a way that would resound through a hall like this.\nThe sound of delicate heels. Click, click.\nTurning slowly, he saw the Silent Witch wearing a hood, accompanied by her attendant.\nThe attendant behind the Silent Witch was a black dragon going by the name Bartholomew Alexander, grinning when his eyes met Isaac's.\nMeanwhile, the Silent Witch wore a deep navy robe that hugged her slender figure. The robe had an elongated back hem that fluttered beautifully with each step.\nHer decolletage was modestly open, a small jewel gleaming against her pale chest. The gem reflecting the crystal chandelier's sparkle was a peridot.\nIsaac's gaze was transfixed by that necklace.\nHe had once gifted it to her. With the unreasonable thought that at least one person should remember a man named Isaac existed, he had given it to her.\n——\"Peridot shines beautifully even in the faintest light of night. If you wear it, I'll be able to find you right away.\"\nThose were the words he had said when presenting the necklace to a young girl long ago.\nAnd that very necklace now glittered at the Silent Witch's bosom.\nStanding before the motionless Isaac, the Silent Witch parted her rose-tinted lips.\n\"The one before you is the real Felix Ark Ridill.\"\nDeclaring so in a clarion voice, the Silent Witch removed her hood.\nThe revealed profile, though made up, was unmistakable.\n\"I, Monica Everett the Silent Witch of the Seven Sages, shall prove this to you.\"",

      "content": "The moment the Silent Witch removed her hood, a stir went through the room.\nFew knew the face of the Silent Witch, who rarely appeared in high society and kept her hood on even at ceremonies. In fact, there were likely few who had even heard her voice.\nShe had always kept a low profile, hunched in corners, shrinking away from attention. But now she stood straight, her back upright, gripping the golden staff permitted only to the Seven Sages.\nWith traces of youth in her made-up face, her light brown hair was tied up high, adorned with a chaste white rose ornament. Her mystical eyes, appearing brown or green depending on the light, looked straight ahead…directly at Duke Crockford.\n…Why had he not realized it until now?\nAmidst the confusion, Isaac questioned himself inwardly.\nLady Everett, whom he revered, had been so close by all along.\nThinking back, there had been plenty of hints. And yet, in Isaac's mind, the \"revered Lady Everett\" and the \"timid little Monica Norton\" had never connected as one and the same.\nTruthfully, even seeing Monica before him now, Isaac could scarcely believe it.\nThe black dragon in human form watched Isaac with an amused grin.\nAh, but that black dragon at her side alone was the proof that she was the Silent Witch.\n\"Silent Witch.\"\nCutting through the commotion, the King spoke.\nWith those two words, the hall fell as still as if doused with water.\nThe King, his brow unfurrowed, calmly regarded the Silent Witch.\n\"You claim that one is the true Second Prince.\"\n\"Yes.\"\nEven before the King, the Silent Witch opened her mouth without faltering, her demeanor stately.\n\"As you may know, Your Majesty, allow me to explain again for those present here. Since last autumn until now, I have been attending Serendia Academy as a student while guarding His Highness the Second Prince.\"\nThat the Silent Witch had been secretly guarding the Second Prince in disguise caused another stir.\nEven Duke Crockford furrowed his brow, if only momentarily.\nAmid this, one of the ministers close to the Duke raised his voice angrily,\n\"What is the meaning of this?! Serendia Academy is under Duke Crockford's jurisdiction! To sneak in there under false pretenses is a mockery of His Grace…!\"\nWhenever someone yelled at her, Monica Norton would typically flinch, her eyes welling up as she hung her head.\nBut the Silent Witch merely cast a chilly sidelong glance at the ranting minister and stated,\n\"Does your outburst hold enough value to interrupt my explanation?\"\nThe minister's eyes bulged as he fell speechless. \"…Wha-?!\"\nClearly, he had never imagined a mere young girl around his child's age would talk back to him like that.\nAs the minister's face reddened with rage, the Silent Witch stated flatly,\n\"This guard duty was entrusted to me directly by His Majesty the King. Do you take issue with His Majesty's decision?\"\n\"Why… no, but…\"\nConfirming the minister had fallen silent, the Silent Witch continued, \"For nearly a year, I have observed His Highness the Second Prince up close. Therefore, I can state with certainty——this is the real prince.\"\nDeclaring so in a confident, assured tone, the Silent Witch slowly surveyed those present.\n\"If my sole testimony is deemed insufficient, then…\"\nWith those words, the Silent Witch snapped her fingers.\nHer attendants stepped back into the hallway, only to return holding a stack of documents.\nThe dragon in human form handed the documents to the Silent Witch with an overly theatrical flourish.\nThe Silent Witch took one paper and read aloud in a resounding voice,\n\"‘I have conversed with my brother, the Second Prince Felix Ark Ridill, multiple times at Serendia Academy since meeting him at the New Year's Ceremony. His statements then were consistent and logical. If one is to declare him an impostor, a proper investigation of the facts should be conducted. Albert Frau Robelia Ridill, Second-Year Student of Serendia Academy's Junior Division.'\"\nThe sudden mention of the Third Prince's name left everyone present, Isaac included, gaping in astonishment.\nOnly Duke Crockford's expression hardened ominously.\n\"‘Prince Felix is the savior who rescued my Duke Reinberg House during the Dragon Damage. As a heroic prince skilled with the sword, how could he be so easily killed by mere assassins? Furthermore, when the prince stayed at my family's duchy after the winter break, he spoke of events there without any contradictions. If he was truly replaced by an imposter after the New Year's Ceremony, it would be impossible for him to casually discuss the food he ate at my home, including the flavors. Please reconsider this matter carefully. Eliane Hyatt, First-Year Student of Serendia Academy's Senior Division.'\"\nFollowing the Third Prince, the name of the Lady of House Reinberg also appeared, further stirring the crowd's reaction.\nDuke Reinberg himself seemed unaware of his daughter's actions, his eyes wide with surprise.\n\"‘The duties of the Serendia Academy Student Council President are immense, making it impossible to fulfill them overnight, even with prior information gathering and preparation. Any Serendia alumni present at this Supreme Council should well understand this. After the New Year's Ceremony, the Student Council President's performance remained flawless. He also remembered minute details from before the winter break. Therefore, the claim that the Student Council President was replaced after the New Year's Ceremony should be reconsidered. Cyril Ashley, Third-Year Student of Serendia Academy's Senior Division.'\"\nThe Silent Witch took the statements one by one, reading out their contents aloud,\n\"‘The prince highly praised the music I performed at this Serendia Academy and even allowed me to play at the magic duel's stage after the new year! At that time, the prince who requested my performance also referenced my past performances, demonstrating a true understanding of my musicality. It would be impossible for someone recently replaced to comprehend my musical essence! Therefore, I stake my life as a musician to declare that the Serendia Academy Student Council President Felix Ark Ridill is genuine! Benjamin Moulding, Third-Year Student of Serendia Academy's Senior Division.'\"\nIsaac's fellow students who had spent time with Felix as himself were testifying to his innocence.\n\"‘Chess. Playing chess would easily reveal whether someone is genuine or not. Prince Felix Ark Ridill participated in the previous chess tournament, leaving records behind. If he is an imposter, a single game of chess would immediately expose it. If a verification match is required, I would gladly oblige. Just let me know. Robert Vinkel, First-Year Student of Sellendia Academy's Senior Division.'\"\nAh, I can't help but wonder why I did chess with him.\nDespite the situation, Isaac couldn't help but inwardly chuckle.\nAfter reading through several statements, the Silent Witch snapped her fingers again.\nInstantly, the thick stack of documents held by her attendant fluttered up as if borne by wind——chantless magic, no less.\nThe papers danced as if with a will of their own, arranging themselves in flawless beauty before the King.\nThe awe-inspiring display of intricate mana control, performed chantlessly by the Silent Witch, drew looks of trepidation.\nYet the one responsible for such a showy performance continued speaking as if it were no great matter,\n\"These are testimonies gathered from the teachers and students of Serendia Academy. I ask that you read them before passing judgment.\"\nAmong those present were Serendia alumni and parents of current students. To them, these testimonies could not simply be dismissed as childish drivel.\nMoreover, with such a substantial number, each individual account, no matter how trivial, would warrant verification.\nThe truth was that Felix and Isaac had swapped places ten years prior. But here, the stated time was \"after the New Year's Ceremony\", so the students' testimonies did not contradict.\nJust how had the reclusive Monica gathered so much evidence?\nBut what is she thinking…?\nMonica surely knew the truth – that Isaac had caused her father's death, that he was an imposter Second Prince.\n\"That one has already admitted his guilt.\"\nThe speaker was none other than Duke Crockford.\nThe Duke's expression was unreadable——yet an aura as sharp as a drawn blade oppressed all present.\n\"He has already confessed his crime. What more is there to discuss with this impostor?\"\nWith each word from the Duke, the atmosphere shifted.\nHis words rang true. The Duke's words were righteous. This aura radiated outward like ripples centering on the Duke's faction.\nThe Silent Witch cut through that chain with a single declaration:\n\"Then let me show the truth, so that all may understand.\"\nSaying so, the Silent Witch drew something small from her sleeve.\nIt appeared to be a small goblet——not gold or silver, but glossy jet-black as if carved from stone itself.\nHolding it up for all to see, the Silent Witch proclaimed loudly,\n\"With this magic tool of my creation, the ‘Black Chalice', I shall prove that the one before us is true of royal blood.\"",

      "content": "\"With this magic tool of my creation, the ‘Black Chalice', I shall prove that the one before us is true of royal blood.\"\nMonica Everett the Silent Witch, proudly raised the Black Chalice before the country's leader…\n….Uh, what was the next line agaiiiiiinnn…? Ugh, my stomach… my stomach is killing meeeeee…\nShe was battling terrible stomach pains.\nNot to mention, her hair was tightly bound up high causing a headache, her corset was laced tighter than ever before, and most dreadfully, the extremely high heels she wore felt like her toenails might fall off any moment.\nMonica had only one reason for bringing her staff here despite there being no magic duel——it was not to make her look more dignified, but because she simply couldn't walk properly in those heel shoes without a staff.\nLeaning on her staff, Monica quietly took a breath with an \"Oo-hah.\"\nHer stomach hurt like it was being wrung out, and her heart was pounding so fast it felt like it might jump out of her mouth.\nAs Monica slowly caught her breath and looked up, her eyes met Isaac's.\nIsaac was gazing at Monica with a perplexed expression.\nI wonder if he will be disappointed after knowing the true identity of the Silent Witch… yeah, he must be…\nSeeing how much he had respected the Silent Witch made Monica's chest ache with guilt. Her stomach too.\nEven so…\nMonica lightly jingled her necklace with her fingertips.\nCatching the glimmer of the peridot reflecting the lights, Isaac seemed to hold his breath.\nHe had once told her that as long as she wore this, he would be able to find her.\nPlease, watch me… how I prevail in this fight.\nPressing her frantically beating heart through her clothes, Monica recalled the script Isabelle had prepared for her.\nUp to this point, Monica's lines were drafted through everyone's input and ultimately reviewed by Lady Isabelle Norton and her maid Agatha.\n\"What's most important in getting through the Supreme Council is solidifying an image! From here on, the witch Monica will be portraying is an intellectual, cool, and confident one who never lets her emotions show on her face! Of course, the usual gentle Sis Monica is lovely too, but this contrast is perfect. Ah, just imagining the cool-acting my Sis is… how wonderful!\"\nWhenever Monica seemed unsure of the specific image, Isabelle would whisper in her ear,\n\"If you're having trouble with the lines, just imagine Lady Bridget.\"\nIndeed, Bridget was prideful, always self-assured, and carried herself with dignity.\nEven if jeered at, she would simply dismiss it with a curt \"Be Silent.\"\nI can… do this…\nAfter all, Monica now had the magic spell Cyril had given her.\nTaking a slow breath, Monica wove her words,\n\"This magic tool analyzes mana contained in one's blood. By comparing the analysis results… it is possible to verify blood relations.\"\nSaying so, Monica angled the Black Chalice where Duke Crockford could clearly see it.\nThe Duke did not openly contort his face, but Monica sensed the air around him sharpen further.\nThere was no way he did not know of the \"Black Chalice\"——for it was none other than he who executed the man trying to create this tool seven years ago.\n\"Is there anyone here who has relatives present? Ah, Baron Barrel, I believe your son is a court clerk?\"\nThe middle-aged baron Monica addressed by name seemed to jolt a little.\nMonica gave the baron a thin smile. She had wanted to smile beautifully like Bridget, but this awkward smile was the best Monica could manage with her stiff face.\nStill, her clumsy smile appeared intimidating enough.\n\"Wh-What are you trying to make me do, Silent Witch…?\"\n\"Please provide a drop of your blood. Of course, I will not curse it or anything.\"\nBaron Barrel fidgeted his gaze about as he dabbed the sweat on his face with a handkerchief.\nTo the hesitant baron, the King instructed,\n\"Baron Barrel. Cooperate with Silent Witch's performance.\"\n\"Y-Yes, Your Majesty!\"\nPrompted by the King, Baron Barrel approached with stilted steps.\nMonica took out a needle and lit a small flame with chantless magic.\nThe tiny flame was no larger than a candlestick fire, yet producing it chantlessly seemed to surprise those around, their eyes fixated on the chantless fire.\nMonica heated the needle in the flame before handing it to the baron.\n\"A drop of blood from your fingertip will suffice.\"\nSaying so, Monica twirled the bottom of the Black Chalice.\nThe bottom portion was shaped like a shallow dish filled with a reagent liquid.\nShe let Baron Barrel's blood drip into the reagent before returning the chalice bottom to its original state.\nSwirling the chalice lightly to absorb the blood into the liquid, Monica took out a new needle.\n\"First, allow me to experiment with my own blood for comparison.\"\nMonica then pricked her own fingertip with the heated needle, squeezing out a drop of blood to fall into the chalice's basin.\nShowing that nothing happened with unrelated blood added.\n\"As you can see, adding blood unrelated to oneself does not trigger any reaction in the Black Chalice.\"\nMonica wiped away the blood she had put in and called over Baron Barrel's son, handing him the needle.\n\"Next, I shall add a drop of the baron's son's blood into the upper portion of the chalice. A single drop will suffice.\"\nThe young clerk, Baron Barrel's son, solemnly let a drop of blood from his fingertip fall into the Black Chalice.\nAt first, nothing happened.\nBut gradually, the area where the blood touched began seeping the same crimson hue.\nMonica started to open her mouth but closed it again.\nShe forgot her line.\nLet's see, what was I supposed to say here…? \"Behold!\" was too grandiose so we scrapped it…and \"Pay attention, everybody!\" was Lord Glenn's suggestion that got rejected… Then the line Lady Isabelle came up with was…\nAfter replaying Isabelle's suggested line in her head, Monica spoke aloud,\n\"Now, bear witness… to the moment the Black Chalice takes on the color of blood!\"\nProclaiming it in a sonorous voice, Monica angled the chalice to show its reddening interior as she raised it high.\nWhat was once jet-black-like lacquerware, the insides of the Black Chalice were rapidly turning crimson. Eventually, the reddening spread to the outer surface until the entire chalice shone like a brilliant pigeon-blood ruby.\nThe spectators let out a chorus of astonished gasps.\n….Dad, everyone is amazed by the magic tool you created.\nThe praises rightly belonged to her late father, the original creator. Feeling a twinge of bittersweetness, Monica lowered the chalice.\n\"In this manner, when the blood of a relative is added to the upper portion after setting the baseline blood at the bottom… the entire chalice takes on the color of that blood.\"\nTechnically, the results of a medical analysis tool should display values like \"X% probability of being blood-related.\"\nHowever, Monica deliberately chose to have the chalice stain itself like the fictional \"Black Chalice\" for its powerful visual impact——and to make a pointed statement to Duke Crockford.\nYou killed Benedict Rayne, the man who tried making this tool… I know what you did.\nMonica went to Nero, who stood by with a toolbox and disposed of the spent reagent before rinsing the chalice with specially prepared purified water.\nSince the Black Chalice was a tool to analyze mana, using mana-imbued water would contaminate the results——thus requiring magic-free purified water for cleaning.\nOnce rinsed clean, the chalice returned to its original jet-black color. Confirming this, Monica turned to face the King.\n\"With utmost deference, I ask to take a drop of Your Majesty's blood, to dispel the suspicions cast upon Prince Felix.\"\n\"…Very well. Bring the chalice here.\"\nMonica stepped forward and, following the same steps as with Baron Barrel, drew a single drop of the King's blood to set at the chalice's bottom.\nShe then turned and knelt before Isaac, offering up the Black Chalice.\n\"Your Highness, to preserve your honor, please permit me to prick your fingertip with this needle.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nWhat is she intending to do…?\nIsaac was still unable to escape his confusion.\nMonica should know that Isaac was not the King's true blood-related son.\nAh…I see. This must be her way of condemning me.\nTo expose the sin of the man who killed her father, using her father's own creation… This was her form of vengeance.\n\"As you wish.\"\nAs Isaac offered his hand, Monica said \"Pardon me\" before pricking his fingertip with the needle.\nA bead of blood welled up from the tip. Monica took Isaac's hand and turned it palm-down.\nA single drop of blood plopped into the basin of the chalice.\nShe would surely present this unchanging jet-black chalice as condemnation against him.\nHer father's murderer.\nBut as Isaac gazed hollowly at the chalice with a wry smile, his expression froze.\nMonica raised the Black Chalice high. Its interior rapidly started staining crimson, the reddening eventually encompassing the entire chalice.\nA rich, vibrant shade of blood.\nWith a voice ringing louder than before, Monica proclaimed,\n\"This crimsoned chalice is proof that the one before us is indeed Prince Felix Ark Ridill!\"",

      "content": "Sorry for the late posting. Have been busy in RL.There'll be another chapter after this.\n──That's just ridiculous.\nThat was what Isaac shouted in his heart, and surely Duke Crockford would do that as well.\nWhile everyone else in the hall was exclaiming in admiration at the presentation of the Silent Witch, only Isaac and the Duke, who knew the truth, were stunned in disbelief.\nIsaac was just an ordinary citizen. Of course, he didn't carry any royal blood or have any blood relation to the king.\nBut, how…?!\nAs the atmosphere in the hall escalated suddenly, Duke Crockford dropped a cold remark.\n\"Silent Witch. That criminal has already stated, ‘I admit to all crimes.' No matter what suspicious color that dubious magic tool of yours turns, words once spoken cannot be undone.\"\nThe Duke's words made the hall fall into a dead silence.\nThat's right, the Duke was correct. Isaac had already admitted to all crimes in this very hall.\nIf he were truly the Second Prince, he should have pleaded his innocence.\nEveryone nodded in agreement with the Duke's words, whispering that it was indeed so.\nAmidst this, Monica calmly said, \"What I am about to say may be a great shock to you all… but please listen.\"\nJust what is she…trying to pull?\nAs Isaac watched with bated breath, Monica solemnly announced,\n\"His Highness Felix is under a terrible curse.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\n──Now, this is the real test.\nMonica clenched her stomach, steeling her resolve.\nReading the statement and unveiling the chalice were one-sided acts where only Monica spoke to those present.\nBut from here on, it would be a \"fight\"…a one-on-one fight with Duke Crockford.\n\"Do you all remember the cursed dragon incident that occurred in the Duchy Reinberg at the end of last year?\"\nThough several months had passed since the incident, it was surely not forgotten, especially by Duke Reinberg who was directly involved.\nSuddenly thrust into the spotlight, Duke Reinberg seemed ill at ease, his gaze wandering around restlessly.\n\"I was present at the scene where His Highness Felix solved the cursed dragon. There, I realized a dreadful truth.\"\nHere, she paused at length to draw the audience's attention.\nRecalling the staging notes written in Isabelle's script, Monica raised her voice with emphasis.\n\"That cursed dragon was artificially summoned by a shaman! The name of that shaman is Peter Sams.\"\nThe sudden mention of the name caused most present to look perplexed.\nHowever, one person reacted noticeably──Duke Reinberg, Eliane's father.\nThe Duke was likely unaware that the missing servant of his household was a shaman. But from the way he kept glancing at Duke Crockford as if seeking help…\nDuke Crockford sent Peter to you, didn't he?\nAnd for some unknown reason, Duke Reinberg ended up accepting Peter.\nMonica felt a slight pang of sympathy for Duke Reinberg as she continued,\n\"This man Peter is a dreadful shaman who can manipulate living beings with curses. Manipulating living beings through curses is forbidden… yet Peter freely controlled the dragon with his curses. And then…\"\nMonica glanced momentarily at Isaac, putting on a pained expression.\n\"To silence His Highness, who was beginning to realize the truth behind the cursed dragon incident, Peter also cursed His Highness Felix. Just as he did with the dragons, he put a terrible curse on His Highness to brainwash and control him at will!\"\nThe Second Prince was cursed.\nAt Monica's words, murmurs arose in the hall. If it were true, how dreadful it would be.\nIf one could not only control dragons but also a prince at will… they could seize control of the entire nation.\n\"However, the curse Peter cast was incomplete. Thus, His Highness desperately resisted the curse… and consulted the Jeweled Magician, with whom he had long been acquainted.\"\nThe Jeweled Magician was one of the Seven Sages who supported the Second Prince. It was no surprise that Felix would choose him as an advisor.\n\"But Peter realized this and poisoned the Jeweled Magician, leaving behind a fake will at the scene. Shocked by the Jeweled Magician's death, His Highness succumbed to the curse… and was brainwashed by Peter.\"\nAt these words, the moderator, whose presence had become almost negligible, timidly interjected.\n\"Then… when he admitted to all the crimes in this hall is also…\"\n\"Yes, he was made to say that by the shaman Peter.\"\nMonica nodded, glancing briefly at Duke Crockford.\nThe Duke did not change his expression overtly… but his gaze towards Monica had clearly changed the moment she mentioned Peter's name.\nMonica had brought up Peter's name in this hall as a warning to Duke Crockford.\n──I am aware of what you have done.\nIf Monica revealed the connection between the Duke and Peter, as well as the Duke's involvement in orchestrating the cursed dragon incident from behind the scenes, the Duke would be in a dire predicament.\nBut that would not do.\nIf I drive Duke Crockford to ruin… he might expose the truth from ten years ago.\nThen Monica's plan to save Isaac would be rendered futile.\nAt the Seven Sages Summit, Louis Miller had said,\n\"In politics, what is right does not necessarily become the truth. What is convenient for those in power may sometimes become the truth.\"\nIn other words, what matters is a truth that is convenient for everyone… a \"compromise.\"\nMonica deliberately refrained from pointing out the connection between Peter and Duke Crockford. This way, the Duke could maintain his position as a \"victim whose important grandson was brainwashed by a shaman.\"\nIsaac, too, could maintain his position as a \"victim brainwashed by a shaman.\"\nMonica held the Duke's greatest weakness──his connection to Peter──while still being able to save Isaac.\nAnd the one who would benefit the most was…\n\"Silent Witch.\"\nThe King, who had been quietly observing the proceedings, solemnly spoke.\n\"In other words, the Second Prince is… still under the influence of this curse?\"\n\"Yes, that is correct.\"\nAs Monica nodded, the king turned his gaze towards Abyss Shaman Ray Albright, seated among the Seven Sages.\n\"….Abyss Shaman. Is what the Silent Witch says true?\"\nSummoned by the King, Ray reluctantly stood up and shuffled forward.\nGlancing briefly at Isaac, he muttered in a monotone voice.\n\"Ah, what a strong curse this is. I've never seen such a curse before.\"\nThough somewhat flat in delivery, no one paid it much mind, as Ray normally spoke in a toneless manner.\nRay hunched his robe-clad back and placed a finger on Isaac's forehead. He then began to mutter an incantation.\nSuddenly, an eerie pattern appeared on Isaac's forehead, glowing brightly.\nEveryone was startled, but the light soon subsided, and the mysterious pattern faded away.\nRay slowly raised his head.\n\"…Now, the curse has been lifted. The prince should be back to his usual.\"\nThe king gazed silently at Isaac and Monica in turn.\nThen, in a voice that resonated throughout the hall, he declared solemnly:\n\"Summon the physicians at once to examine my son who has been freed from the curse!\"\nThose words were the verdict.\nThose who had been watching with bated breath let out a collective exclamation, while Duke Crockford, his expression unchanged, glared at Monica.\nMonica met his gaze unflinchingly.\nI am fully aware of everything you have done.\nYour role in driving my father to his death seven years ago.\nYour scheme behind the cursed dragon incident.\nIf you dare bare your fangs from now on──I will reveal the entire truth.\nShe silently conveyed this as she returned his gaze.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"So how's it? Is this whole thing settled, then?\"\nThe Artillery Magician, who had not quite grasped the flow of events, glanced sideways, likely assuming the Thorn Witch to be of the same ilk.\nRaul was covering his mouth with his hand, his shoulders trembling as if suppressing laughter.\n\"Oi, Thorn. What're you snickering about?\"\n\"Well… Hahaha.\"\nRaul dodged the question vaguely while briefly glancing at Monica and Ray.\nSo the final trump card in this bluffing battle was the \"curse that makes part of the body glow\"! That Ray sure got to have all the fun!",

      "content": "While maintaining the magic duel barrier and observing the situation, Neil confirmed that Louis's mana was depleted in the crystal ball and called out to Cyril.\n\"The mana of the Barrier Magician has been exhausted. I will dissolve the magic duel barrier.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nDue to the insect-attracting curse cast by the Abyss Shaman, Louis had to continue maintaining the barrier until the curse's effect wore off. Moreover, flowers that absorb mana were planted in the flower field.\nLouis's mana was depleted almost at the same time as the insect-attracting curse wore off.\nIf his mana ran out, he could no longer fly to the palace using flight magic.\nLouis is quick-witted and eloquent. So they detained him here to prevent him become a hindrance at the council meeting.\nFurthermore, Louis is also skilled in close-quarters combat. So they erected a magic duel barrier to seal that ability.\nAdditionally, Louis is also proficient in magic duels. So they set a trap to drain his mana.\nIn short, Monica thoroughly adhered to the two points of \"not engaging Louis in his areas of expertise\" and \"only detaining him.\"\nAfter dissolving the magic duel barrier, Neil and Cyril headed towards the forest to regroup with Glenn and the others.\n\"…Did the Supreme Council meeting end safely?\"\nNeil muttered, and Cyril snorted and strode on ahead.\n\"We went to such great lengths… It must have been accomplished.\"\nHe didn't specify who, but Cyril's words still carried a hint of trust.\nThat's right. Cyril and Neil didn't trust the Silent Witch, but rather the young girl Monica, the student council member, whom they sent off.\nShe would surely handle it well.\nWith that thought in mind, Neil looked up ahead and froze.\n\"U, Um, Vice President… look…\"\n\"What is that smoke…!?\"\nFrom the direction of the flower field where the final magic duel took place, smoke was billowing up.\nWith an ominous feeling, the two hurried toward the direction of the smoke and saw…\n\"Cough! Cough! Cough! Cough! Ah, Neil! Vice President! P-Please help! Cough! Ugh…\"\nGlenn and Roberto, tied up with vines and hanging upside down from a tree, being smoked from below by a bonfire.\nNext to the bonfire, Louis Miller the Barrier Magician was waving his discarded jacket to fan the flames, directing the smoke right at Glenn and the others.\n\"Wh-, What on earth is happening…?\"\nNeil asked apprehensively, and Louis turned his head.\n\"I'm burning smoke that repels insects to get rid of the insects on my jacket. It's also a bonus that I can smoke out these brats, killing two birds with one stone.\"\nFor the thirty minutes until the insect-attracting curse wore off, Louis had to maintain the barrier while being swarmed by insects at his feet. Now, with a straight face, he grumbled as he waved his jacket, causing smoke to billow up and strike Glenn and Roberto directly.\nLouis's mana should have been depleted… but it seems that after the magic duel barrier was dissolved and physical attacks became possible, he captured Glenn and Roberto and hung them upside down.\n\"Um, where is Senior Hubert Dee…?\"\nNeil asked with a strained expression, and Glenn shouted through the smoke.\n\"That guy, cough, used us as decooys… Cough, and escapeeeeeeeed~~!!\"\nTears streamed down Glenn's face, seemingly from the smoke irritating his eyes, while Roberto simply said, \"Regrettable,\" with his usual calm demeanor.\nAs Neil fretted about how to get them down, Louis glared at him and Cyril.\n\"Now, I can see that you are the sons of Marquis Highon and Baron Maywood family… But this prank has gone a bit too far for children's mischief. Are your fathers aware of this?\"\nHe was implying that he would inform their fathers.\nCyril was about to retaliate, but Neil stopped him with \"Please wait.\"\nCyril was probably going to take responsibility, but as the descendant of the Mediator family, it was Neil's role to mediate this situation.\n\"Silent Witch, Magic Count Monica Everett, is acting to secure the release of Prince Felix Ark Ridill.\"\n\"That prince is an imposter. That is an unchangeable truth.\"\nLouis glared at them, and Neil nodded in acknowledgment.\n\"Yes, we know.\"\nLouis slightly raised his eyebrow at those words.\nLouis probably thought that Neil and the others were assisting Monica without knowing the circumstances.\n\"Silent Witch… Magic Count Everett explained everything to us and then asked for our cooperation. We stand here fully aware of the situation.\"\n\"…That little girl?\"\nLouis narrowed his ash-purple eyes behind his monocle.\n\"That's a hard story to believe at first. She's not the type of witch to easily trust others, is she?\"\nCyril twitched his brow at Louis's barbed words.\nHe was about to retort with a furrowed brow, but Neil gently restrained him and looked Louis straight in the eye.\n\"Magic Count Everett… no, let me put it this way. Miss Monica trusted us. That's why we responded in kind. That's all there is to it.\"\nIt's easy to say, \"That's all there is to it.\" But it's hard to imagine how much courage the shy Monica had to muster to do so.\nThat's why Neil wanted to respond to Monica's trust. After all, she was his fellow student council member for a year.\n\"Regarding this matter, Miss Monica intends to resolve it as follows,\n‘Prince Felix is the real one. Any implications that he was an imposter were due to being brainwashed by a certain curse magician's curse.'\nThe Duke Crockford and Prince Felix were victims ensnared by that shaman… and it will be settled without anyone being executed.\"\nMonica has an ace up her sleeve to bring down Duke Crockford.\nHowever, if she pushes the Duke too far, she risks exposing the truth from ten years ago and implicating Isaac Walker.\nMore importantly, if the Duke, the most influential figure in this country, is executed as a criminal, it will cause great turmoil in national politics.\nThe Duke has overseen far too many matters in the court. He may be a ruthless person, but his contributions to this country are also overwhelmingly significant.\nListening to Neil's explanation, Louis scowled unpleasantly and grumbled while wrinkling his nose.\n\"I see, in other words, she intends to sweep everything under the rug. That little girl has become quite cunning… But even so, the chances are fifty-fifty. If Duke Crockford forces his way through, anything could happen.\"\n\"No, Miss Monica will definitely win.\"\nNeil firmly stated, and Louis gave him a skeptical look.\n\"Are you going to say something like, ‘Because I believe in my friend'?\"\n\"Well, that's part of it, but…\"\nNeil smiled at Louis's sarcasm, cleared his throat slightly, and straightened his posture.\n\"Miss Monica has left a message to us.\"\nDuring the strategy meeting, Monica made this suggestion to Neil.\n‘If Louis is extremely angry and takes it out on Glenn and the others, please convey this to him──'\nAnd then Monica took a breath, put on a somewhat serious expression, and said,\n\"──'Listen, my colleague, the game has begun before you even sit down at the table.'\"\nUpon hearing those words, Louis opened his eyes wide to their limit and muttered in disbelief.\nA resolution where no one, not even Duke Crockford or Isaac Walker, is executed and everything is swept under the rug.\nWho stands to benefit the most from this outcome?\nIt is…",

      "content": "When Isaac returned to the private room of Felix Ark Ridill within the palace, he was still unable to take in the situation.\nSince then, he had been taken to the infirmary, where doctors came in and out, his shackles were removed, and his health was checked…\nBefore he knew it, the day was already fading, and the world outside the window was dyed vermilion. The sunset was as red as blood──its color reminded him of the chalice raised by the Silent Witch.\n…I wonder what kind of trick that was.\nAs he was vaguely thinking about this, there was a knock on the door, and the voice of a servant was heard.\n\"Your Highness Felix. His Majesty has summoned you to his private room.\"\n\"…I'll be right there.\"\nIs it really okay to leave the man who was just treated as a criminal free, without even an escort?\nMoreover, to summon him to the King's private room…\nHowever, he had no choice but to obey, so Isaac slowly stood up and straightened his appearance.\nHe let out a small, bitter laugh as he put on the royal garments he thought he would never wear again.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"I, Felix Ark Ridill, have arrived as your summon.\"\n\"Enter.\"\nThe King's voice heard from inside the room did not sound like that of a frail, sick person.\nAs he stepped into the room, the King was seated in a chair, facing a chessboard.\nSeated elegantly across from the King was Mary Harvey the Star Oracle Witch, though she did not seem to be his opponent in chess.\nThe King played chess alone, while Mary watched him, her gaze distant, as if observing the night sky as she chanted about the stars.\nWhen Isaac entered, Mary quietly stood up.\n\"Then, I shall take my leave~\"\nMary left the room, leaving behind a girlish chuckle.\nIsaac stood by the entrance, waiting for the King to speak.\n\"Make your move.\"\n\"Yes.\"\nIsaac took the seat Mary had occupied and looked at the chessboard.\nThe board was somewhat even, but White had the advantage. If White wished, it could checkmate the King in just a few moves.\nThe King's gnarled fingers moved a White Queen. Not a bad move, but not the best one either; it would not lead to an immediate checkmate.\nThe King muttered while still looking at the chessboard.\n\"At the moment of checkmate, this game ends. But in reality… what do you think happens to a country that has lost its King?\"\n\"It would descend into chaos.\"\nIsaac answered immediately, and the King nodded slightly, rolling a Black Pawn between his fingertips.\n\"And that outcome is not necessarily desirable for the victor. In reality, there are many cases where an unresolved game is more convenient.\"\nThe unresolved game was likely a metaphor for the earlier council meeting.\nThanks to the Silent Witch's actions, Duke Crockford failed to dispose of Isaac.\nIsaac who was unable to retaliate against Duke Crockford, was having narrowly escaped death.\nAs a result, the one who benefited the most was none other than the King himself.\nDuke Crockford is ruthless but capable. There are many matters he can handle that others cannot. That is why, until now, the King has not parted ways with him, keeping each other in check.\nPrince Felix Ark Ridill whom Isaac has been portraying is also a capable prince, having achieved results in numerous diplomatic affairs.\nIf either Duke Crockford or the Isaac-played Felix were to be executed, it would throw the country into great turmoil.\nMoreover, if foreign nations learned that the Second Prince was an impostor, the Ridill Kingdom's credibility would plummet, rendering their previous diplomatic achievements meaningless.\n\"Isaac Walker.\"\nIsaac froze at the name uttered by the King.\nAh, he had a vague premonition… indeed, the King knew.\nThat the Second Prince was an impostor.\nLikely, the reason for assigning Louis Miller of the First Prince's faction as Felix's guard was to investigate the Second Prince's true identity through Louis.\n\"I am the King. Thus, I shall turn a blind eye to the sins of those who led my grandson──the Second Prince──to his death, for the sake of the nation.\"\nThe real Felix was practically driven to suicide thanks to Isaac and his grandfather.\nThe man before him chose to protect the nation, but he must still hate the sight of this impostor bearing his son's face.\n\"So, these are the words of a father.\"\nFor the first time, the King looked up from the chessboard and met Isaac's gaze.\nHis eyes were gentle, intelligent… and kind.\nIsaac recognized that smile… it was the same as Felix's.\n\"Thank you for being a friend to my son, and for trying to protect his honor.\"\nIsaac's throat tightened. A dull ache throbbed in the back of his head.\n\"…No.\"\nThe word slipped out, rough and hoarse.\nForgetting how to breathe, Isaac let out a short, sharp exhalation. Self-mocking, or perhaps in confession.\n\"…I couldn't protect him.\"\nThe fact that he had led Felix to his death would continue to torment Isaac, forever.\nTo the bowed Isaac, the King gently told him,\n\"You should hear his final wish from her. She awaits you in the reception room.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAfter leaving the King's room, Mary Harvey the Star Oracle Witch stopped by the balcony at the end of the hallway. On the balcony stood an old acquaintance, a man with impeccable posture gazing at the setting sun.\nThe man's blond hair, streaked with white, glowed like burning flames in the orange of the sunset.\n\"Are you feeling sentimental, Darius?\"\nAt Mary's words, Darius Nightley of Duke Crockford did not turn but answered.\n\"You knew everything, didn't you, Star Oracle Witch?\"\n\"I wonder.\"\nMary sauntered forward and leaned on the balcony railing, looking up at the Duke.\n\"The alignment of the stars is quite simple. Seeing the future is never difficult. But the human heart is very complex. I cannot read hearts, you see.\"\nShe could see one's destiny, but not their heart.\nEspecially not with such a tangled web of human relationships.\n\"Did you want war, Darius?\"\n\"……..\"\nThe Duke did not answer. But Mary, who had lived the same years, knew.\nRidill Kingdom's last war was over fifty years ago, a territorial dispute with the Empire.\nInitially, Ridill Kingdom had the upper hand in the war.\nThey could have pressed on for complete victory. Yet despite that situation, the previous Duke Crockford──Darius's father──proposed peace, arguing against further sacrifice.\nEventually, the previous Duke Crockford was assassinated.\nNot by the Empire, but by those within Ridill Kingdom who desired total victory.\nThe people of Ridill, headed by the previous King, denounced Darius's father as a coward, a disgrace to the nation.\nThe young Darius Knightley had not only lost his father but was branded the son of a coward.\nAround that time, Mary, merely a Marquis daughter and not one of the Seven Sages, was betrothed to the Duke's son Darius. However, Mary's father unilaterally broke off the engagement, saying he could not give his daughter to the son of a man who had damaged national interests.\nYet a year later, the war took an unfavorable turn, and Ridill was forced to accept a ceasefire on terms advantageous to the Empire.\nWhat did Darius think of that half-hearted war outcome? Mary did not know.\nBut surely, he still carried the bitter feelings from that time, like a lingering specter.\n\"In this incident, I will likely be seen as a fool who treated his own grandson──the Second Prince──as a criminal.\"\n\"I suppose so~. Planning to pass your title to someone?\"\n\"Eventually, I may have no choice.\"\nWhile not a fatal blow, Duke Crockford's authority had certainly been diminished by this incident.\nThe Second Prince would be given some territory and title, and exiled from the capital under the guise of recovering from a curse.\nNot too far in the future, the King would likely name Lionel, the First Prince, as his successor.\nMost likely, the King had always intended for the First Prince to succeed him, but could not officially name him due to Duke Crockford's formidable influence in supporting the Second Prince.\nWith the Duke's authority weakened from this incident, the King can now name the First Prince as his successor without any hindrances.\n\"I have been thoroughly defeated by the trap set by the King.\"\nTo the Duke's self-deprecating mutter, Mary let out a bell-like laugh.\n\"No, no, while the King may have set things in motion initially…\"\nNarrowing her pale blue eyes, the Star Oracle Witch declared in a solemn tone, as if making a prophecy,\n\"…It was Silent Witch who guided events to this conclusion, you see.\"\nBoth Duke Crockford and Isaac had deluded themselves into thinking they were the chess players.\nAnd they had intended to outmaneuver each other, moving the pieces… or so they thought.\nBut in reality, the Duke and Isaac were merely pawns themselves.\nThe one observing the entire chessboard was the King alone.\nIn the chess game the King played solitaire, and the one seated opposite him was the Silent Witch Monica Everett.\n\"You see, after the Seven Sages Summit, that child requested an audience with the King… she must have seen through his feigned illness.\"\nWhen seated before the chessboard with the King, that timid, cowardly girl's expression changed.\nWith a chilling blankness, she explained her plan, and finally said,\n──\n‘This outcome will be most beneficial for you, Your Majesty. So I would like your cooperation.'\n\"So the King's cooperation with the Silent Witch at the council was for that reason.\"\nIn other words, the outcome had been decided the moment the Supreme Council began.\n\"…What a terrifying witch, she is.\"\n\"Now, now, don't say ‘terrifying.' Call her a fine woman who knows the value of words and silence.\"\n\"Perhaps you should remain silent yourself, occasionally.\"\nTo Darius's words, the mature witch puffed out her cheeks petulantly.\n\"If you'll be that mean, I won't foresee your future anymoore~!\"\n\"I have no need. I only use prophecies for my own benefit.\"\n\"I know, I know~ During the Cursed Dragon Incident, you even used my prophecy against me!\"\nMary had heard the details of the Cursed Dragon Incident from Monica.\nAnd she knew who had killed their fellow sage, Emanuel Darwin the Jewelled Magician.\n…She knew everything, yet still acted this way.\nThe ruthless Duke Crockford muttered softly, \"Women are truly terrifying creatures.\"",

      "content": "Isaac had come all the way to the front of the reception room, but stopped in his tracks before the door and lowered his hand, which he had raised to knock.\nI wonder what kind of expression should I face her with…\nEven knowing the true identity of the Silent Witch, Isaac still could not fully accept everything.\nThe feelings Isaac harbored towards her were far too complex.\nThe respect and admiration the Seven Sages had for the Silent Witch.\nThe guilt towards Monica Rayne, the girl who had lost her father because of Isaac.\nThese overwhelming emotions were all jumbled up in the depths of his stomach, still indigestible.\nAnd yet, he could not just stand there forever.\nIsaac took a small deep breath and knocked on the door, which then opened from the inside. The one who opened it was the black-haired, golden-eyed servant.\n\"Yo, Sparkles.\"\nAs usual, the Black Dragon had no intention of remembering people's names, grinning mischievously as he invited Isaac in.\nInside the room, Monica was sitting neatly on the sofa.\nClad in the navy robe only the Seven Sages were permitted to wear, with her light brown hair tied up beautifully, Monica slowly raised her face upon noticing Isaac.\nHer green eyes, shimmering in the lighting, gazed at Isaac. The moment their eyes met, Isaac felt a tightness in his chest, as if it were being constricted. Words would not come out smoothly.\nAs Isaac stood frozen before the door, Monica slowly rose from the sofa and──\n\"Fwah!?\"\n──she stepped on the hem of her robe and fell flat on her face.\nA resounding crash echoed through the quiet room.\n\"……..\"\n\"……..\"\nThe awkward silence was broken by the pitiful sound of Monica sniffling.\n\"Nero… get me… my staff…\"\n\"Alright, here you go.\"\nHe discovered one thing. The name of this Black Dragon, who named himself Bartholomew Alexander, seemed to be Nero.\nCome to think of it, I feel like she had occasionally murmured \"Nero\" under her breath… Could it be she was referring to him?\nNero handed Monica the staff that had been leaning against the wall.\nPuffing out rough breaths of \"Fuh fuh\", Monica clung to the staff as she stood up.\nHowever, her legs were trembling unsteadily, more ungainly than a newborn fawn.\n\"…Did you hurt your foot from that fall?\"\nWhen Isaac inquired, Monica shook her head vigorously.\n\"Um, today the heels on my shoes were just… sooo, sooo high…\"\nSaying this, Monica spread her thumb and index finger as far apart as possible to demonstrate.\nI see, so that's why she had looked quite tall today──it wasn't due to a dignified bearing, but rather the extreme height of her shoe heels.\n\"After wearing these shoes all day… my toes, were at their limit…\"\nClutching her staff, Monica tried to walk but Isaac raised a hand to stop her.\n\"Please, stay seated. May I join you over there?\"\n\"O, of course!\"\nLooking relieved, Monica sat back down on the very edge of the sofa, her body scrunched up.\nFinding that rather amusing, Isaac took a seat right next to her.\nMonica's slight shoulders twitched, and her teary eyes avoided Isaac's gaze, fixated on the floor instead.\nHer completely deflated demeanor did not at all resemble the person who had carried herself so proudly in the Supreme Council chamber.\nIsaac leaned in and placed a hand on Monica's forehead.\n\"Oh dear, your forehead is swollen.\"\nHe gently caressed the spot she had knocked against the floor, then glanced at Nero.\n\"Could you fetch some ointment from the infirmary?\"\n\"Ah, I see what this is. You want me to be considerate, is that it?\"\n\"Your perceptiveness is much appreciated.\"\nMonica was staring up at Nero, her mouth agape.\nNero snorted and nodded in response.\n\"Well, I am a considerate kind of servant, you know. Alright, I'll go grab some real quick.\"\nWith that, Nero left the room with a shuffle.\nBeside him, Monica let out a voice of utter despair, \"Ahhh…..\"\nAs the door closed with a thud, Monica froze like a statue.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nWh-, wh-, wha-, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do!?\nMonica was sweating profusely all over as she inwardly clutched her head.\nShe had intended to carry herself with dignity before Isaac as the Silent Witch.\nBut the moment she tripped over the hem of her robe and fell, her spirit had somehow… broken.\nJust blurting out \"Fwah!?\" as she fell, there was no way to maintain any sense of dignity after that.\nOn top of that, all the words she had wanted to say to Isaac had spilled right out of her head when she tumbled over. Ah, if only numbers and formulas were as easy to forget!\n\"Monica.\"\nIsaac called out her name. Not Lady Everett, but Monica.\nTurning towards him, Monica scrunched up her face like a scolded child and lowered her head.\n\"Um… I'm really sorry for telling so many lies…\"\nShe had truly wanted to live up to his expectations as the Silent Witch.\nBut having expended everything at the council, Monica no longer had any reserves left to put on airs before Isaac.\n\"…I'm sure you're disappointed that I'm the Silent Witch… I'm sorry…\"\n\"I'm no different from you. I was telling lies too.\"\nA quiet voice informed her so.\nAs Monica fell silent, Isaac calmly asked,\n\"What kind of trick was that with the Black Chalice?\"\nThe King and Isaac were not blood-related, yet the Black Chalice had turned crimson.\nIn response to Isaac's doubt, Monica forced an awkward laugh.\n\"Well, you see… that chalice is a proper magic tool.\"\nThe Black Chalice was currently submitted as evidence. If they had it appraised by either Minerva or the Association of Magicians, it would be proven to be a genuine magic tool.\nThe crucial part of this deception was THAT \"Black Chalice is authentic.\"\n\"The blood I poured into the grail at that time… was His Highness Albert's.\"\n\"Albert's?\"\nThe Third Prince Albert could not attend the Supreme Council meeting, but he was currently staying at the palace.\nRight before the council began, Monica had taken a blood sample from Albert and stored it in a vial to prevent coagulation, concealing it in her sleeve.\nWhen the time came to pour Isaac's blood into the grail, the reason she touched his hand was to naturally let the vial's blood drip into the grail from her sleeve.\nAt Monica's explanation, Isaac looked surprised.\n\"…So Albert was one of your co-conspirators, then.\"\nHe murmured, gazing intently at Monica.\n\"You knew I was a fake, and yet… why would you help me like that?\"\nIsaac wore a self-deprecating, bitter smile.\nHis azure eyes looked dull and hollow.\n\"I wouldn't mind even if I had just been executed at that time.\"\n\"Y-, You can't!\"\nMonica blurted out instinctively.\nThe words she wanted to say were all jumbled up in her head, failing to cohere.\nBut she could not stay silent.\n\"You can't say things like that. So many people lent their strength to help you… Lord Cyril, Lady Bridgett, Glenn, and others…!\"\nMonica alone could not have completed the Black Chalice or gathered that many testimonies.\nMore importantly, if Glenn and the others had not stalled Louis, he might have seen through their deception.\n\"Everyone wanted to help the Student President they admired. They wanted to attend graduation with you. So… they all, they all helped so much…\"\nAs Monica desperately pleaded, Isaac's cold, expressionless face softened, his dull azure eyes fixing on her.\n\"The scholar Benedict Rayne… he was your father, wasn't he?\"\nThe mention of her father's name from Isaac's lips pierced Monica's chest.\n\"Y-, yes.\"\nAs Monica answered with trembling lips, Isaac suddenly grabbed her wrist and pulled her towards him.\n\"Hyaah!?\"\nMonica ended up straddling the supine Isaac on the sofa as if she had pushed him down onto it herself.\nAs Monica blinked with wide eyes, her hands braced against Isaac's chest, he guided her hands to his own neck.\n\"I was the reason for your father's death… My obsession, and Duke Crockford's obsession, has killed your father.\"\nWith her fingers pressed against his neck by Isaac's hands, Monica could feel his pulse throbbing through the thin skin.\n\"You have the right to take revenge on me.\"",

      "content": "──Revenge\nThat has always been a terrifyingly sweet word for Monica.\nWhen her father died, she had the choice to give in to anger and hatred and live for revenge.\nBut Monica just cried, grieved… and escaped into the world of numbers.\nIt's not that she had no anger or hatred towards the person who killed her father. But she was afraid to surrender herself to those intense passions.\n\"I wouldn't mind if you killed me. Go ahead and strangle me, or burn me to ashes with your magic.\"\n\"I can't…\"\nEven as Monica answered with a trembling voice, Isaac kept pressing her hand against his own neck, refusing to let go.\nIsaac's hand was chillingly cold.\n\"If it's you, you could have exposed all of mine and Duke Crockford's deeds to the light, and declared your father's innocence.\"\nIf Monica revealed the truth about the body swap ten years ago, she could have claimed her father's innocence, as he was executed to conceal that truth. But Monica did not do that.\nBy pursuing the truth behind Benedict Rayne's execution seven years ago, the truth of the body swap would be exposed.\nAnd then, Isaac's execution would be unavoidable.\n\"…Yes, if I made everything public, I might have been able to put my father's resentment to rest.\"\nWhen considering this Isaac rescue operation, that was what caused Monica the most conflict.\nIf she kept everything ambiguous and hid the truth in the dark, she could save Isaac.\nBut then she wouldn't be able to pursue her father's innocence.\n\"…If I told the truth, they would know that father wasn't evil…that father was amazing…I could shout that out loud to everyone…\"\nHow much she must have wished she could yell that at the Supreme Council's gathering.\n\"But even so…even so, I…\"\nDrop by drop, tears fell onto Isaac's cheeks.\nIsaac's hand loosened. His azure eyes looked up at Monica in confusion.\nMonica scrunched up her face and muttered in a trembling voice,\n\"…I wanted to save you, the you who is alive now.\"\nPutting her father's honor on one side of the scale, and Isaac's life on the other, Monica chose Isaac's life.\nOver and over and over again, apologizing to her father in her mind.\nMonica slid down off of Isaac and wiped her eyes with the sleeve of her robe. Then she took out a leather-bound diary from the bag beside the sofa.\nThe moment Isaac saw the cover, he seemed to realize what it was. His eyes flew open, staring at the diary.\n\"…That's…Ark's…\"\nYes, the genuine diary of Felix Ark Ridill, which Monica obtained from the northern monastery.\nEver since reading this diary, Monica had made up her mind.\n──She would absolutely save Ike and show him this diary.\n\"Please read this.\"\nWhen Monica offered him the diary, Isaac took it with a tense expression and gently stroked the cover with his fingertips.\nHe let out a sigh, and his profile seemed to be reminiscing about the past.\nIsaac opened the diary cover. Then he slowly read through each page, one by one. Monica watched in silence.\nFor a while, the only sound in the silent room was the rustling of turning pages.\nEventually, as the diary reached its latter half, the image of the \"Ideal Prince\" appeared.\nBeside the prince's illustration were the conditions for an ideal prince. One of them was \"kind to everyone,\" with a circled check mark that Isaac traced with his finger.\n\"Ah, yes. I was the one who circled that.\"\nHe muttered in a half-talking-to-himself voice, and Isaac closed his eyes.\n\"I drove my dearest friend to suicide, burned his body, and took his place… and yet, I couldn't even leave behind a proper legacy before barely surviving.\"\nIsaac's finger turned the page. The next page recorded Felix's despair upon learning the truth.\nAnd his childish scheme to set Isaac free.\n\"…I couldn't become the kind prince, could I, Ark?\"\nHis hoarse voice sounded almost like a confession.\nUnable to become the kind prince and unable to leave behind a proper legacy, he would live on as Felix Ark Ridill from now on.\nNo longer able to aspire to the throne, in an incomplete standing.\n\"Please read to the very end.\"\nMonica, who had silently watched over him all this time, clutched the hem of Isaac's robe as she told him wordlessly.\n\"That's where Felix's true wish is written.\"\n\"His… True wish…?\"\nThe wish that Isaac thought Felix had was \"to remain in people's memories.\"\nHe expressed this by alluding to the founding king's story, saying, \"I want to leave my name behind, make it shine like a constellation.\"\nBut the wish Felix left right before he helped Isaac escape the manor was something else entirely.\nAs Isaac turned the page and his eyes fell upon the words, he froze.\n‘I may not be able to become a king, but I will still strive to become a kind prince that Ike can be proud of.\nEven if I cannot become a magnificent constellation recorded in history, Ike will surely never forget me and will remember me.\nAnd when he grows up, I will go and meet Ike. As Ark, Ike's close friend.\nI want to hear all sorts of stories from the grown-up Ike. What kind of life he chose. What wonderful things he discovered. What wonderful people he met.\nI'll have those conversations with Ike over drinks.\nIt doesn't matter if I'm already an old man, or even an elderly man by then.\nSomeday, I will absolutely, without fail, go to meet Ike.\nThat is my dream from now on.'\nFelix helped Isaac escape the manor, wishing for the day they would meet again.\nEven if he couldn't leave behind a grand legacy or become a magnificent star, he believed his close friend Ike would never forget him.\n\"…Felix's death was not a suicide… it must have been an accident.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThe memories of that night resurged vividly in Isaac's mind.\nEven after ten years, the recollection remained fresh and vivid.\nThe two of them sneaked out of the manor to gaze at the stars. A strong gust of wind blew, tossing their hair about.\nBranches swayed and leaves rustled, and Felix's hand clutching his was completely cold.\n\"The wind is getting stronger. Let's head back, it's not good for our bodies if we stay out any longer, Ark.\"\n\"Yeah…\"\n──That's right. The wind was strong that night.\nA ladder had been propped against the top floor balcony of the manor.\nOn the roof, Felix's golden hair glistened faintly.\nA powerful gust of wind blew, and the round moon peeked out from behind the clouds.\nTwinkling stars surrounded the dimly glowing moon.\nAs if finally able to see them, Felix reached out his hand toward the shining stars… that's right, he let go of one hand.\nAnd then, he fell.\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"It was… an accident…?\"\nIt was true that Felix caused a commotion to help Isaac escape, but he had no intention of suicide.\nFelix, abandoned by his grandfather, did not choose death in despair.\nHe truly dreamed of reuniting with Isaac someday.\n\"Felix wanted you to live freely. To find things you like, people you like… and then, someday, meet you when you have found those things.\"\nIsaac's downcast eyes were hidden by the fringe hanging over them.\nBut Monica saw the tears soak into the diary's pages as they dropped.\n\"…Ark.\"\nHis hoarse voice uttered his departed friend's name.\nIsaac had blamed himself for driving Felix to his demise. So he tried to discard his face and name to become Felix, believing it would fulfill young Felix's wish.\nBut… Felix's true wish had been for Isaac's happiness all along.\nFrom now on, Isaac would have to live as the Second Prince of this country. Having already discarded his face and name once, he could no longer live as Isaac Walker.\nEven then…, Monica thought.\n\"I believe there is something you can do from now on, to fulfill Felix's wish.\"\nEven if his actions were restricted, Isaac was still alive.\nAs long as he lived, there were many things he could do.\n\"Find lots and lots of fun things, things you like, for yourself and no one else… Because that's… what Felix wished for.\"\nAs Monica desperately tried to weave her words together, Isaac slowly raised his face.\nHis azure eyes were swirling with confusion, but… the fire of obsession was gone from their depths.\nMonica furrowed her brow and smiled at Isaac.\n\"…So please, live. Never think that you'd be better off dead. If you died… Felix's wish would never be fulfilled.\"\nIsaac stared at Monica in silence for a while.\nAlthough tense, Monica looked back at him without averting her eyes.\n\"You…\"\nIsaac's lips trembled slightly.\n\"Why would you go… this far…\"\nWhy would she go this far, why could she do this much──for the man who was the reason for her father's death?\nTo the perplexed Isaac, Monica straightened her back and cleared her throat.\n\"You know… someone once said something to me that made me happy, and I've wanted to say it myself just once.\"\n\"……?\"\nTo the bewildered Isaac, Monica puffed out her chest and declared.\nIt was the words Lana had once said to Monica when she seemed apologetic for always being the one rescued,\n\"You don't need a reason, to help a friend, Ike!\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nIt felt as if the lump that had been stuck in his chest for so long was melting away.\nAs he inhaled deeply, fresh air filled his lungs. It was like breathing fully for the first time in ages.\nThat's right, he had always felt suffocated… by guilt.\nThe girl who had magically dispelled what bound Isaac seemed about to puff out her chest proudly, but then hunched over and fidgeted with her fingers nervously.\n\"Ah, um, well, it might be presumptuous of me to call myself a friend… since, well, we're just nightlife friends… and…\"\nAh, this is bad.\nIsaac let out a wry laugh of a sigh and raked his fingers through his disheveled hair.\nSeeing Monica anxiously furrow her brows at him, Isaac squinted.\nWhat filled the emptiness in his chest was a warm emotion.\n…How could I not fall for her?\nGiving in to the impulse of affection, Isaac pulled Monica into an embrace. A muffled \"bwah\" sound came from just below his chin.\nIsaac chuckled, the vibrations rumbling in his throat, and whispered into Monica's ear.\n\"Thank you, Monica.\"\nHe then gently pressed his lips to her blushing white cheek.\nThe slender body he held in his arms went rigid as a board. Monica clapped a hand to her cheek, turning beet red and trembling violently.\n\"Wh…wh…wh…wh…\"\n\"Wh?\"\n\"Not a paw paaaad!\"\nIsaac threw his head back with a hearty laugh he hadn't had in ages.\nOutside the door, Nero muttered \"I'm a cat that can read the atmosphere,\" as he held a small jar of ointment and stifled a yawn.",

      "content": "\"…As stated in the report, it's decided that all causes lie with the shaman Peter Sams. And the Second Prince, who escaped execution, will likely leave the capital after graduating from Serendia Academy under the pretext of recuperating from the curse.\"\nWhile listening to Heidi's report, the Emperor carelessly raised his goblet.\nYuan, standing by his side, poured grape wine into it, and the Emperor sipped its contents.\n\"I see, with this, Duke Crockford will lose his influence, and eventually the First Prince will become king… Silent Witch has fulfilled her promise to me.\"\nWith this flow of events, it seems there will be no war between the Empire and the Ridill Kingdom for the time being.\nAs the Emperor, he wouldn't have minded even if Duke Crockford was executed… In fact, that would have been more convenient for him. The Duke was a capable man with immense power. Losing him would be a heavy blow to the Ridill Kingdom.\nAnd the Emperor secretly schemed to take advantage of their weakened national strength.\n\"Hmph, what a dull and uneventful result she led us to. Just as expected of that ambitionless girl.\"\n\"If it were Your Majesty, you'd probably have taken Duke Crockford's position for yourself.\"\nAt Yuan's murmur, the Emperor chuckled hoarsely.\nThat's right. It's precisely because he has kicked down the incompetent and those in his way that he now sits on the Emperor's throne.\nThe Emperor drained his grape wine, licked his lips with a smack, and gazed at the goblet in his hand.\n\"While the ending lacked excitement… that Black Chalice mentioned in the report is intriguing. Silent Witch surely creates rather interesting things.\"\nThe existence of the Black Chalice has not been made public within the Ridill Kingdom. Currently, the Kingdom's Association of Magicians and Magic Tool Union are frantically analyzing the Black Chalice.\nAs an Empire promoting medical magic, the Empire desperately wants the technology of the Black Chalice, which can analyze genes.\n\"Surely Silent Witch didn't create it alone? Was Minerva involved in its development?\"\n\"No, it was manufactured in the workshop of Marquis Anvard's territory.\"\nAt Heidi's words, the Emperor tapped his temple with his fingertip.\nHe had heard the name of Marquis Anvard's territory several times before. When it comes to producing high-quality large magic tools in the Ridill Kingdom, it's the first name that comes to mind.\nJust as the Empire leads other countries in medical magic, the Ridill Kingdom is one step ahead in magic tool technology. If they could cooperate technologically, it would benefit both sides.\nMoreover, while the Empire has a larger territory than the Ridill Kingdom, it has less land suitable for agriculture. For this reason, the magic tool industry is something the Empire wants to actively adopt, to provide jobs for people living in such lands.\n\"Hmm, very well, let us establish a new treaty with the Ridill Kingdom. By promoting technological exchange with the artisans of Marquis Anvard's territory, or enhancing the exchange student system between institutions for training mages, it will eventually bring great benefits.\"\n\"But I don't think the Ridill Kingdom will easily let go of their own technicians, do they?\"\nAt Yuan's point, the Emperor snorted.\n\"Well, then we'll just have to improve the facilities of our own universities and workshops to the point where magicians and magic tool technicians from other countries will want to come to our country of their own accord! The alliance is merely a means to facilitate movement between the two countries.\"\nThe Emperor does not hesitate to invest in facilities for the sake of developing his own country.\nMore prosperous! More convenient! And more importantly, more fun! That is the Emperor's motto.\n\"For that purpose, we shall establish a new position in our country! The pinnacle of magic technicians in our nation! Its name shall be: ‘Magic Technology Honorary Adviser, Imperial Magic Cross Blaze Four Heavenly Artisans'!!\"\n──Magic Technology Honorary Adviser, Imperial Magic Cross Blaze Four Heavenly Artisans.\nYuan repeated the words with a blank expression and commented,\n\"…Your Majesty, that doesn't sound like a title for a crafting position.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nTwenty days had passed since the Supreme Council, but the upper echelons of the Ridill Kingdom were still busy with the aftermath of the scandal surrounding the suspicion that the Second Prince was an imposter.\nA prime example of this was the Seven Sages.\nStarting with the fact-checking of the petition brought by the Silent Witch to the council, they also had to analyze the magic tool \"Black Chalice\" she created, as well as investigate the sorcerer she mentioned in her statement.\nOn top of all the council-related work, they had another major task.\nThat was the selection of a new member for the vacant seat among the Seven Sages.\nIn the Jade Room within the Ridill Kingdom's castle, Louis Miller the Barrier Magician, Raul Roseburg the Thorn Witch, and Ray Albright the Abyss Shaman were engrossed in narrowing down the list of candidates to become the new Seven Sages member.\nSince Louis was a former Magic Corps commander, he was well-versed in capable battle magicians. Raul and Ray, on the other hand, came from long lines of magician and shaman families, so they had plenty of interactions with prestigious mages. Therefore, these three were tasked with initially listing promising candidates and roughly narrowing them down.\n\"Seriously, not a single impressive one among them.\"\nAs Louis flipped through the list, he had an obvious look of annoyance on his face as he wrote comments next to the names.\nThe comments included scathing remarks like \"zero battle experience, just fluff,\" \"famous professor's pet goldfish,\" \"third-rate in their papers,\" and \"only redeeming quality is connections.\"\nLouis then divided the files with comments into three piles.\nWatching from the side, Raul asked puzzledly, \"What are those piles for?\"\n\"‘Outright rejected,' ‘Mediocre,' and ‘Barely worth considering'… Hey, who recommended my idiotic disciple?\"\n\"Oh that? I thought it'd be fun.\"\nAs Raul raised his hand, Louis clicked his tongue openly.\n\"‘Outright rejected'!\"\n\"Eh~ I think he has some redeeming qualities. A magician who was trained in barriers by Barrier Magician and had his magic formulas instructed by Silent Witch. You don't find many like that, do you?\"\nAfter all, Louis' disciple Glenn Dudley possesses a mana capacity comparable to Raul's.\nAs Raul praised Glenn, Louis frowned and dipped his quill pen into the inkwell.\n\"I'll admit he has great potential. Yes… perhaps too much potential, which is why now is not the time to let him spread his wings.\"\n\"So you're actually being a proper mentor, huh?\"\nAs Raul laughed, Louis snorted and moved on to the next file.\nFollowing Glenn's recommendation was Hubert Dee, nephew of the Artillery Magician and a troublemaker expelled from Minerva.\nLouis crossed out his name with a large ‘X'.\n\"‘Outright rejected'!\"\n\"Hey, hey, don't tell me you're still hung up over that magic duel the other day?\"\n\"……..\"\nUnusually, Louis furrowed his brow and muttered resentfully.\n\"…Do you know what my daughter said to me when I came home that day with insect-repellent grass stuck to my coat?\"\n\"Huh? But your daughter was just born, right?\"\n\"As I approached the bed to see my daughter's sleeping face, she opened her eyes, just like her lovely mother, and said… ‘Stinky'.\"\nIt's hard to believe a newborn would know the word \"stinky.\"\nRaul thought she might have just let out a hiccup or sneeze that sounded like \"hinghi,\" but Louis' expression was utterly serious.\n\"…Can you imagine a father's feelings when his own daughter calls him stinky? Eh? …Are you listening, Shaman?\"\nOf course, Ray was ignoring Louis' snide remarks and silently sorting through the candidates.\nHowever, upon closer inspection, Ray had divided the list into just two piles. Young women, and everyone else.\n\"…New Seven Sages… colleague… I want a girl who will love me…\"\nSo much for doing his work seriously. This is what he was up to.\nIf Raul passed Ray's piles to Louis, he would likely have a fit. So Raul decided to re-sort them himself.\nAs he worked on re-sorting the candidates, Raul returned to casual conversation with Louis. He preferred chatting while working whenever he was with someone.\n\"But you know…\"\n\"What is it?\"\n\"For someone who's still hung up on it, you didn't really lash out at Monica, did you?\"\nAfter the Supreme Council ended and Louis belatedly arrived at the castle, he was brimming with killing intent while Monica had the look of someone resigned to death. However, all Louis said to her was a single line.\n──You did well, little girl.\nHe said just that and left the scene.\nWhen Raul brought up that moment, Louis shrugged slightly.\n\"The barking of a defeated dog is not my hobby. Honestly… that was the second time I was cleanly defeated by that little girl.\"\nHe must be referring to the time Monica beat him in the magic duel in the selection of the Seven Sages.\n\"But you know, deep down you respect Monica the most, don't you?\"\n\"One cannot turn a blind eye to facts. The fact is that girl possesses exceptional talent… When I witness that talent firsthand, this entire list starts to look like trash that should be burned.\"\nHe remarked so despite his own disciple being on that list.\nWhat a frightening statement, Raul muttered to himself. Then he remembered something and mentioned it.\n\"Speaking of Monica, I saw her rushing out of the palace in a hurry earlier. Did she have some urgent business?\"\n\"Well, that's because…\"\nLouis stopped moving his quill pen and looked out the window.\n\"Today is the graduation ceremony at Serendia Academy.\"",

      "content": "The graduation ceremony of Serendia Academy is held in early summer, just before the start of the social gathering season.\nThat day, a pleasant blue sky stretched from the morning, and the blowing breeze was comfortable, a fitting day to celebrate the departure of the graduates.\n\"We graduates take pride in the days we spent at this Serendia Academy with our seniors. With that pride in our hearts, we promise to continue striving and to carry the future of the Ridill Kingdom without shaming the name of this Serendia Academy. Finally, I pray for the further success of our seniors, and I will conclude my farewell address. Neil Clay Maywood, student representative.\"\nThe small-framed Neil stood with pride as he read the farewell address in a resounding voice.\nWhen Neil was initially appointed as the student council president, many did not look favorably upon someone from a baronial family becoming the president.\nHowever, when the previous student council president was nearly executed on suspicion of being an imposter, Neil gave precise instructions to the academy students, and after the incident was resolved, he worked tirelessly on the aftermath and reporting. Now, everyone looks at Neil with trusting eyes.\nEspecially Claudia, seated in the current students' section, looks unusually proud.\n\"Next, a speech from a graduate representative, Felix Ark Ridill.\"\n\"Yes.\"\nReplacing Neil, Isaac rose from his seat and ascended the podium.\nHis current position of being the \"prince who was brainwashed by a shaman's curse and nearly executed as an imposter\" is a rather delicate one.\nAfter graduating, he will be granted territory and peerage, and it has been decided that he will live away from the capital under the guise of \"recuperation.\" In other words, he will be \"retiring at a young age.\"\nNaturally, the students' gazes toward him are quite nuanced. Especially those who had tried to curry favor with the Second Prince, a candidate for the next king, have rather blatant expressions. Some even look as if they have been betrayed.\nIsaac did not deny this. Of course, he thought it was a deserved consequence.\nHowever, if he shifts his gaze slightly, he can see Cyril in the graduate's section, looking directly at him with the same unwavering gaze of respect as when they first met in the Junior Division.\nAnd next to Cyril, Elliot was looking at Isaac with a somewhat provocative smile. That mischievous, mean-spirited look on his face seemed to say,\n──Show me you can handle it until the end, you imposter.\nAh, indeed. It seems Elliot still didn't quite like Isaac.\nWell, I don't like you either, Elliot Howard. You bullied Ark quite a bit, but then you suddenly got chummy with him. I really dislike that.\nStill, Isaac was somewhat grateful that Elliot cooperated with Monica.\nIsaac let a smile befit Felix Ark Ridill surface on his face. This might be the last time he has to play the role of Felix in front of a large crowd.\n\"I am sincerely grateful that such a wonderful ceremony has been held today.\"\nA perfect princely smile, perfect enunciation. He had cultivated this for over ten years. It was easy enough that he didn't need to be conscious of it.\nAs he spoke of memories of seasonal events and gratitude toward the teachers, Isaac casually glanced around the hall.\nMonica Norton's figure was nowhere to be seen among the current students' seats.\nShe had withdrawn from Serendia Academy after that day with the Supreme Council.\nAs one of the Seven Sages, she was already quite busy. Moreover, after her great maneuvering at the Supreme Council, she seemed to be flying back and forth to various places to provide explanations.\nParticularly the Black Chalice that Monica had created based on her late father's blueprints was a groundbreaking invention that shook the magic tool industry.\nWith the cooperation of Duke Anvard, she was currently handling procedures such as assessing its capabilities and patent applications at the Magic Tool Association.\nThe last time Isaac met Monica was their exchange in the reception room after that Supreme Council meeting.\nSince that day, Isaac had not seen Monica even once.\nHe had sent her an invitation to the graduation ceremony and the subsequent party but received no reply.\nShe was said to be busy flying all over the place, so perhaps she hadn't even noticed the invitation itself.\nI really wanted her to see me standing here, though.\nIt was only because Monica was there that Isaac could stand in this place and graduate from Serendia Academy.\nNo matter how much he expressed his gratitude, it would never be enough. That's why he wanted to convey his feelings of gratitude here.\nAs Isaac was delivering his perfect valedictory speech, just as he was about to give the closing remarks, he paused.\nAnd instead of as Felix Ark Ridill, he spoke the last words as Isaac Walker.\n\"The days I spent at this academy were more precious than anything. Surely, these memories will remain in my heart forever.\"\nHe had thought that his academy life, acting as the ideal prince, was merely an extension of the social circle.\nAchieving the desired results in academics and student council activities, gaining the trust of those around him… he had intended it all as preparation for eventually becoming king himself.\nHowever, this past year had been a series of unexpected events… but it was truly enjoyable.\n\"To all the current students, I hope you never forget to enjoy this limited time. Not for the sake of anyone else, but for your own sake, I hope you find many things to immerse yourselves in, things you like, fun things.\"\nIsaac spoke the wish that the young Felix had once expressed.\n──Not for the sake of anyone else, but for your own.\nNow, he understood why Felix had made such a wish.\n\"Surely… it will become a lifelong treasure.\"\nWith that slightly casual way of speaking for a student council president, the students looked at him with surprised eyes.\nIsaac let out a delighted chuckle and declared loudly, \"And finally, I express my gratitude to the wonderful friends I have made during my time at this academy!\"\nElliot wrinkled his nose in a displeased manner as if to say \"You're no friend of mine…\" It was clearly visible.\nWith a pleasant feeling, Isaac spoke the closing words and lightly descended from the podium.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nThe evening ball held after the graduation ceremony was as glamorous as the academy festival.\nThe students indulged in conversation and dancing, reluctant to part ways.\nEven after the imposter incident, Felix was still inundated with invitations from female students, and the surrounding girls seemed to be watching for any opportunity to talk to him.\nSmiling wryly at the sight, Felix called out to Bridget, who was standing alone like a flower by the window.\n\"Well, Bridget. You look even more beautiful today. In front of your current self, even the roses in the garden would pale in comparison.\"\nBridget, dressed in a deep red one-shoulder dress, glanced sideways at Isaac while hiding her mouth with a fan.\nHer mouth below the fan was not smiling at all.\n\"Each time I hear your flowery praises, do you know how chillingly I have felt?\"\n\"Did you know? My friend was greatly troubled that he could not praise you skillfully.\"\nThe young Felix would always hang his head apologetically, saying he would get nervous in front of Bridget and could not find the right words, despite referring to poetry for praising words.\n\"…Yet that ineloquence was endearing to me.\"\nBridget muttered wistfully, lowering her long eyelashes a little moistly.\nIsaac pretended not to notice and changed the subject.\n\"By the way, I heard you'll be serving as a lady-in-waiting after graduating.\"\n\"Yes, I hope to eventually take on diplomatic work.\"\nFemale diplomats are extremely rare in the Ridill Kingdom.\nHowever, with her language proficiency and quick wit, Bridget will surely accomplish it.\n\"If I become a diplomat, I would like to receive advice from you, Your Highness, who is well-versed in diplomacy.\"\n\"…But there is little a retiring prince like myself can do.\"\nIsaac can no longer stand on the political stage. That is the king's mercy.\nImplying this indirectly, Isaac received a beautiful smile from Bridget. However, her eyes did not smile.\n\"There are many of your fans in other countries. Like Count Mare of Falforia, for example.\"\n\"Ah, a person from the Cursed Dragon Incident… Now that you mention it, he did invite me for a falcon hunt…\"\nHaving already achieved several accomplishments as the Second Prince in his early teens, Isaac had become known by name and face among the nobility of other countries as well.\nThere was no way not to take advantage of that reputation. At the very least, he could provide assistance and be a reception liaison, as Bridget was implying.\n\"…Are you not going to let me retire in peace?\"\nWhen Isaac asked with a furrowed brow, Bridget's amber eyes glinted as she said in a low voice, \"You deceived me for so long, so you can at least cooperate that much.\"\n\"…I feel like I can never win against you.\"\nAs if to escape Bridget's piercing gaze, Isaac averted his eyes out the window.\nSeveral stars were already twinkling in the early summer night sky. But something flickered for an instant, an even fainter glimmer much lower than those stars.\nThe brief sparkle, shorter than a shooting star, was from reflecting the light of the party hall.\nIsaac opened his eyes wide at that twinkling radiance.\nThat was…\nAfter parting from Bridget, Isaac hurriedly moved from the hall into the corridor and hid in the shadows.\n\"Will.\"\nThe pocket watch returned by Monica was still in Isaac's pocket.\nWilldean slithered out from the pocket as a white lizard.\n\"What is it?\"\n\"I'm leaving this place to you.\"\n\"……..\"\nWilldean stared intently at Isaac with thin, pale blue eyes, as if wanting to say something.\nWhen Isaac remained silent with a smile, Willdean landed on the floor in resignation and transformed into an exact replica of Isaac's appearance, using his specialty, illusion magic.\n\"…I thought you had graduated from nighttime wanderings?\"\nIn a rare sardonic remark, Willdean looked utterly serious as Isaac.\n\"Won't you let it slide? The other party is my top priority.\"\n\"…Go on, then.\"\n\"Thank you.\"\nIsaac plucked a rose decorating the hall, tucked it into his chest pocket, and dashed out.",

      "content": "A pleasant early summer night breeze caressed her cheeks as Monica stepped out of the party hall.\nIsaac stopped near the shrubbery he had seen through the window earlier.\n\"Monica.\"\n\"Eh!?\"\nThe nearby bushes rustled, and a hooded head popped out like a small animal emerging from the bushes.\nIsaac suppressed a laugh as he approached the bushes.\n\"What are you doing there, Little Squirrel?\"\nMonica, hiding in the bushes, looked around apprehensively, fussing with the hem of her robe.\nThe robe Monica was wearing was a simple one, not the robe of the Seven Sages. The hem of the skirt had gotten caught in the bushes, exposing her slender legs up to her thighs.\n\"Um, well, I was hiding here, and my robe got tangled… then…\"\n\"Just stay still for a bit.\"\nIsaac bent down and reached for the skirt tangled in the branches. The front part of the skirt was torn up to her thighs.\nIsaac tried not to look at her pale legs as he untangled the skirt.\n\"Now it loosened.\"\n\"Tha-, thank you…\"\nAs Monica bowed her head, the torn hem of her skirt gaped open, revealing her white legs up to her knees.\nRealizing this was quite a sight, Isaac took off his suit jacket and wrapped it around Monica's waist.\nMonica stared wide-eyed at the ornately decorated jacket, shaking her head vigorously.\n\"Ahhh, no, such a fine jacket, I can't, I'll return it!\"\n\"But I can't leave your skirt like that, can I?\"\n\"It's not that cold tonight, so I'll be fine!\"\nLending her the jacket wasn't about the cold, but Monica didn't seem to understand.\nAfter all, she was the type of girl who didn't mind her clothes coming off in front of Isaac.\n\"It's just a bit too… distracting.\"\n\"Oh, I-, I'm sorry… if you find it so unsightly…\"\nThis is bad, she still doesn't get it.\n\"Not in that sense… but for my sake, just think of it that way. If you stay dressed like that, I might have trouble controlling myself.\"\n\"O-, Okay…?\"\nMonica nodded vaguely, not seeming to fully understand, making the peridot necklace around her neck sway.\nThe stone reflecting the party lights was the same color as Monica's eyes.\nIsaac had noticed Monica when he saw the glimmer of this stone while chatting with Bridget.\nSeeing Monica wearing the gift he had given her filled Isaac's heart with joy.\n\"You're wearing the necklace I gave you?\"\n\"Ah, yes, I'm still far from being a fashionista, but… Lana said it's okay to wear things like this casually.\"\nSilently thanking Colette, Isaac smiled softly.\n\"It suits you well.\"\n\"Eheh… thank you.\"\nMonica's bashful smile was no different from before Isaac knew her true identity.\nShe seemed to have been busy lately but didn't look particularly worn out, which was a relief. As he thought this, Isaac asked her a question.\n\"So, why are you in a place like this?\"\n\"Ah, that's right… I wanted to congratulate everyone on graduating…\"\nMonica turned back to the bushes and picked up a basket she had left on the ground. Inside the slightly large wicker basket were several small bouquets.\nMonica offered one to Isaac.\n\"Congratulations on graduating.\"\nSeeing the bouquet offered with those words of congratulation, Isaac couldn't help but smile broadly.\n\"I'm glad to hear those words… especially from you. Though, I really wanted you to come to the graduation ceremony.\"\n\"Well, it would have been a bit… out of place for me to attend as one of the Seven Sages.\"\nMonica seemed concerned that the students at Serendia Academy who didn't know the circumstances would be dumbfounded if she attended the graduation ceremony and party as one of the Seven Sages.\n\"So you came secretly like this?\"\n\"Y-, yes, I wanted to discreetly give flowers to everyone and couldn't figure out how… then I got my robe caught in the bushes and couldn't move.\"\nMonica lowered her brows and laughed shyly.\n\"However I'm relieved when you are the one who found me, Ike.\"\n\"Didn't I tell you? If you wore that necklace, I'd be able to find you right away.\"\nAt Isaac's joking tone, Monica's eyes widened.\n\"Is this… some kind of magic tool…?\"\nIsaac laughed, shoulders shaking at Monica's serious expression and misunderstanding.\n\"No, it's just a good luck charm. A good look charm that lets me find you… wherever you are, connecting us.\"\nIsaac gently lifted the peridot shining at Monica's neck with his fingertips.\nHe leaned in as if to kiss the gemstone matching Monica's eyes, but at that moment──\n\"Your Highness, so you were over here!\"\n──came Cyril's voice from behind.\nIs the timing can be more bad than this? As Isaac turned, he saw Monica's face light up brightly.\n\"Lord Cyril! Good evening!\"\n\"…Treasurer Norton?\"\nCyril stared in surprise at Monica, then at Isaac's jacket wrapped around her waist, seeming confused by the situation.\nMonica hurriedly took a bouquet from the basket and offered it to Cyril.\n\"Um, cong-, congratulations on graduating!\"\n\"You came all this way just to say that?\"\n\"Y-, yes… um, if-, if it's an inconvenience, I'm sorry…\"\nMonica's ears were clearly red even in the dim light as she held out the bouquet, trembling slightly.\nSeeing Monica lowering her head and shaking, Cyril softened his expression slightly and accepted the bouquet.\n\"No, I'll gladly accept it. Thank you, Treasurer Norton.\"\nAs Cyril smiled faintly, Monica grinned sheepishly with delight.\nMonica often smiled like that when facing Cyril… Isaac felt a sudden urge to pinch those relaxed cheeks.\nGazing at the bouquet, Cyril suddenly looked up as if a thought had occurred to him.\n\"Wait, if you're no longer a student, it would be strange to call you Treasurer Norton, wouldn't it?\"\n\"Ah, well… since I'm Lord Cyril's junior…so… you can call me Mo…Moni…Moni…\"\nAs Monica fidgeted with her fingers, stammering \"Moni,\" Isaac placed a hand on her shoulder from behind.\nThen, deliberately raising his voice to cut off Monica's stammering, he spoke.\n\"Cyril, is everything going smoothly at the party?\"\n\"Yes. However, your proxy spirit is starting to struggle, so I wish you could return to assist it.\"\nIt seemed Willdean had learned to rely on others besides Isaac.\nThinking about how he was growing stronger day by day, Isaac smiled.\n\"I see. Then I'll return in a little while, so Cyril, could you help Willdean in the meantime?\"\nEver earnest, Cyril answered with a crisp, \"Understood,\" even when passing off responsibilities to him.\nHis unwavering loyalty, even after learning Isaac's true identity, was truly appreciated.\n\"Also, I was thinking of having a small after-party with just the current and former student council members once the main party is over. Could you arrange a room for us?\"\n\"…! Yes, of course!\"\nWith just the current and former student council members, Monica could attend without reservation.\nSeeing Isaac's thoughtfulness, Cyril looked touched as he hurried back to the hall, saying, \"I'll make the arrangements right away!\"\nMonica watched Cyril retreating back wistfully but then looked up at Isaac with a perplexed expression.\n\"Um, is it okay for you not to go back yet, Ike?\"\n\"I want to spend a little more time with you.\"\nAs expected, Monica just nodded vaguely with an \"Okay?\" not seeming to fully understand.\nIt seems neither Monica nor Cyril is aware of their own feelings…\nIf Monica wasn't aware of those feelings yet, then Isaac still had a chance.\nIsaac took out a flower he had plucked when leaving the hall and removed a ribbon from his suit's decoration. He tied the ribbon around the stem of the flower.\nA yellow rose matching Isaac's hair color, with a blue ribbon matching his eyes.\nHe offered this to Monica.\n\"Will you accept it?\"\n\"…? Um, thank you, very much.\"\nMonica tilted her head in puzzlement as she accepted the yellow rose.\nFor now, Isaac would be satisfied that she accepted it.\n\"Will you keep that flower with you all day today?\"\n\"Is this another good luck charm?\"\n\"…You could say it's similar.\"\nShould he tell Monica the truth about the flower accessory from the school festival now? No, that would feel like losing to Cyril somehow, which was frustrating.\nThis is a good luck charm to make you fall for me.\nHe muttered inwardly, then extended his hand to Monica.\n\"My lady, would you care to dance with me?\"\n\"…? Um, if you wanted to dance, you should probably go back to the hall…\"\n\"Aren't we nightlife friends? Just indulge me a little longer. I enjoy the time I spend with you.\"\nNightlife friend. Upon hearing those words, comprehension dawned on Monica's face. It seemed in Monica's mind, that Isaac held that kind of position for her.\nOf course… Isaac had no intention of staying just friends.\nAfter all, Monica had opened the path that Isaac had once closed off.\n\"I've decided not to give up on enjoying things and pursuing what I find it enjoyable.\"\nKnowing Felix's final wish, Monica smiled faintly and took Isaac's hand.\n\"If that's the case… yes, I'll help with your pursuit of ‘enjoyment,' Isaac.\"\nThe two began dancing to the faint music drifting from the party hall.\nIsaac's perfect escort and Monica's clumsy steps made for a mismatched dance, but Isaac laughed wholeheartedly, clearly enjoying himself.\nThe two were bathed in the gentle light of the hero's constellation shining brilliantly overhead.",

      "content": "Thank you so much Random Person for your generous donation!! m( _ _ )m\nThere will be more bonus chapters.\nUnder the bright summer sky, the resonating sound throughout the castle of the Ridill Kingdom was an orchestral and solo piano performance.\nIt was \"Piano Concerto No. 5\" composed by the rising court musician, Benjamin Moulding.\nThe first movement, with its relatively fast-paced melody, gave the impression of the solo piano and orchestral strings competing against each other.\nThis transitioned into a gentle melody in the second movement, and then burst into a lively rondo in the final third movement, like a flower blooming.\nThe solo piano and orchestra, which had been competing in the first movement, now complemented each other in the third movement, chasing after a single melody. The melody played was rich yet vibrant, deeply stirring the hearts of the audience.\nBoth the King of Ridill and the Emperor of the Schwarzgalt Empire, who was a state guest, seemed greatly satisfied with the performance of this young genius musician, showering the stage with generous applause.\nAmidst everyone immersed in the afterglow of the wonderful performance, Elliot Howard was applauding with a somewhat uncomfortable expression.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nAs Elliot hastily left the concert hall, he locked eyes with a woman walking from the opposite end of the hallway.\nDespite wearing a practical blue uniform, the glamorous beauty who caught his eye was his former classmate, Bridget Graham.\n\"Well, if it isn't Miss Bridget. Long time no see.\"\n\"Good day to you. You came too?\"\n\"Yeah, accompanying my father.\"\nIt had been about a year since Elliot last saw Bridget, at the Serendia Academy graduation ceremony.\nAs the daughter of Marquis Sheilbury, Bridget had rejected all marriage proposals after graduation and instead took the female official recruitment exam, passing with flying colors.\nIn less than half a year, she demonstrated her talents and was exceptionally promoted to become the diplomatic aide to the Third Prince.\n\"I hear you were the one who arranged today's concert, Miss Bridget?\"\n\"Yes. The Black Lion Emperor expressed interest in hearing a rising musical genius from our country.\"\nOn the occasion of the neighboring emperor's visit to the Ridill Kingdom, the First and Third Princes were tasked with handling the reception arrangements.\nFor the Third Prince, who had hardly ever been involved in diplomatic affairs, receiving the emperor was a major diplomatic debut.\nAs the Third Prince's diplomatic aide, Bridget must have been quite busy as well.\n\"Still, you did well to get Benjamin. I bet it was a hassle to invite a moody person like him.\"\nBenjamin had frequently performed at the palace while attending Serendia Academy, but his activities had expanded even further after graduating.\nThere were even rumors that his concert schedule was booked years in advance.\nWhen Elliot pointed this out, Bridget wore a meaningful smile on her well-shaped lips.\n\"Did you know that Silent Witch was invited as a special instructor for the Magic Corps' training a while ago?\"\nThe familiar name caught Elliot off guard, but he nodded.\n\"Yeah… I heard she was quite something\"\nThe Silent Witch had apparently rendered the entire Magic Corps unable to battle at almost the same time as the start of their magic combat training.\nThinking about the usually timid Monica… even knowing her true identity, it was hard to believe.\nStill, Elliot understood, as he knew her formidable skill in chess matches.\n\"…So how does that connect to Benjamin?\"\n\"Benjamin Moulding happened to witness that magic combat when he was struggling for ideas for a new piece.\"\n\"Ah, I think I can see where this is going.\"\nAccording to Bridget, upon witnessing Monica's chantless magic, Benjamin was struck with an epiphany, inspired by her intricate spellcasting to compose a piece.\n‘Oh, that magnificent magic would make for such wonderful music! I wish I could see Miss Monica perform her chantless magic again, preferably in actual combat!'\n\"Conveniently, Hubert Dee was there, so I arranged a little magic combat setting. A special seat was prepared for Benjamin Moulding to observe.\"\n\"…I-, I see.\"\nIn other words, Bridget had prompted Hubert to challenge Monica to a magic combat and had Benjamin observe it.\nShe had done Benjamin a great favor, securing his promise to perform at this concert in return.\n\"Soon, Benjamin Moulding's new piece, the suite ‘Silent Witch', will be completed. The Black Lion Emperor, who became a fan after this concert, will surely be delighted.\"\n\"…If Monica found out, she might just faint mouth foamed from shock, no?\"\nElliot had just experienced the awkwardness of having music composed with himself as the image. To think that the piece from the school festival back then would be completed and released!\nAs Elliot gazed off reminiscing about those days, he noticed the Black Lion Emperor and Third Prince Albert walking side by side down the far end of the hallway.\nElliot hastily straightened his back.\nHowever, the Black Lion Emperor seemed not to notice Elliot at all, instead walking straight towards Bridget.\nUp close, he was indeed a dignified man. His wavy black hair and chiseled features made for a handsome visage, but more than that, his mere presence exuded an overwhelming aura.\n\"Prince Albert has informed me. Miss Bridget Graham. This concert was arranged by you.\"\nUnfazed by the emperor's direct address, Bridget offered a graceful smile.\n\"You flatter me. I merely made the arrangements as per Prince Albert's instructions.\"\nAlbert blushed shyly, acknowledging Bridget's thoughtfulness in giving him credit. The still-young Third Prince then said earnestly,\n\"No, Bridget has been very helpful beyond just this concert. She's an aide far too capable for someone like me.\"\n\"You honor me, Your Highness.\"\nThough Albert had grown taller and more mature-looking over the past year, the way he stole glances at Bridget's beautiful profile was undeniably youthful.\nAs Elliot inwardly chuckled at how obvious it was, the emperor took a step forward and took Bridget's hand. With his rugged features sternly set, the emperor declared,\n\"I took a liking of you. Become my consort.\"\nStunned by the emperor's abrupt proclamation, Albert's expression crumpled, his eyes wide open and jaw dropped.\nIt was unclear from his demeanor whether the emperor was joking or serious.\nEven Elliot let out an \"Oooh?\" as he watched for Bridget's response.\nHow would she answer the proposal from the emperor of the empire, the highest of state guests?\nAs Elliot and Albert watched with bated breath, Bridget lowered her long lashes and let out a wistful sigh.\n\"Your Majesty, I am flattered by your words, but… I have vowed to give myself only to the gentleman who presents me with a blue rose.\"\nSuddenly, the emperor threw his head back and laughed heartily.\n\"Kukahh! Trying to test me, are you… Not bad. I rather fancy a willful woman.\"\nThe emperor leered at Bridget's face with a sly grin.\n\"Very well. There is nothing I cannot obtain. Next time, I shall come to propose with a bouquet of blue roses.\"\nWith that, he flicked his coattails.\nAlbert scurried after him, but Elliot overheard him mutter under his breath, \"Blue roses… maybe Sir Thorn Witch could make some…\"\nAfter the two rounded the corner of the hallway, Elliot glanced sideways at Bridget.\n\"Playing a heavy hitter like that, you really are quite the wicked woman, Miss Bridget.\"\n\"Why, I had no intention of setting an impossible task.\"\nBridget narrowed her golden eyes.\nThe alluring smile on her lips could likely charm most men out of their wits.\n\"Blue roses can be made with just a scarf after all… How adorable.\"\nElliot muttered, \"Oh, so scary,\" with a shudder.\nAN:\nOf all the characters in the story, the man most likely to be remembered in later ages was Benjamin Moulding.\nPiano Concerto No. 5 is the one from V9C9.",

      "content": "Another bonus chapter.\nAs the long vacation at Serendia Academy was entering its latter half and the social season of parties had come to a lull, Eliane Hyatt, having returned from a summer resort, was strolling through a downtown area, dressed in a freshly laundered light blue dress and carrying a parasol. Naturally, she was incognito.\nHis shop should be around here, I believe…\nAs Eliane walked through the lively town relying on a map, she eventually spotted the signboard she was looking for up ahead and stopped in her tracks.\nDudley Butcher Shop. This was the family home of Glenn Dudley, who had recently graduated from Serendia Academy.\nFresh out of the academy, Glenn was serving as an attendant of sorts to his master, the Barrier Magician.\nHowever, for over a year now, the Ridill Kingdom had been without a replacement for the former Jewelled Magician among the Seven Sages. Apparently, Glenn's master had been flying all over the country in search of promising candidates.\nAs a result, Glenn, who was currently holding the fort, had been helping out at his family's butcher shop… or so Eliane had learned by having her servants inquire about Glenn's current circumstances.\nGo, Eliane, you can do it. Alright, it'll be like this. I just happened to visit this town by chance, and as I was passing by that person's family home, I thought I'd greet him on a whim…\nConvincing herself of this, Eliane headed toward the Dudley Butcher Shop, but upon catching sight of Glenn emerging from inside, she hastily hid behind something.\nAdorably clinging to Glenn's right and left arms respectively were two young girls. Both appeared to be around fourteen or fifteen years old.\nThe girl clinging to his right arm had her light brown hair tied into a single ponytail and had slanted eyes.\nThe girl clinging to his left arm had her light brown hair divided into two ponytails and had freckles.\nThe two girls had somewhat similar facial features, so they were likely sisters.\n\"Hey, hey, where ya going? Hey, hey, since you're finally back home, play with us!\"\n\"Yeah, yeah, we wanna hear more stories about the Serendia Academy! Is it true that princesses go there?\"\nThe two chattering girls elicited a grimace from Eliane.\nOh my, oh my, what is this all about? He returns to his hometown only to get all cuddly with girls… Well, as someone who just happened to be passing by, this has absolutely nothing to do with me!\nThe two girls clung to Glenn's arms with the familiarity of those accustomed to being doted upon. Finally, exasperated by their unrestrained clinging, Glenn raised his eyebrows and shouted.\n\"Ah, geez! You're heavy! Ana, Betty, you've both grown up, so if you both hang off me at the same time, I can't move!\"\n\"Well, Glenn, you're being rude to ladies!\"\n\"Even if you're our brother, there are things you can and cannot say!\"\nUpon hearing \"our brother,\" Eliane snapped back to her senses.\nNow that it was mentioned, the two girls did have somewhat similar facial features and hair colors to Glenn.\nOh, gosh, so they're his sisters. If that's the case, it's understandable for them to be a bit too familiar, yes.\nConvincing herself of this and calming her heart, Eliane was about to emerge from her hiding spot and call out to Glenn… but someone else beat her to address him.\n\"Excuse me, Sir Glenn.\"\n\"Oh, Miss Lynn. Good afternoon!\"\nThe one who called out to Glenn was a beautiful, golden-haired woman dressed as a maid. Her unearthly, mystical beauty caused Eliane to freeze in her tracks.\nOh my, a beautiful maid this time? What is their relationship, I wonder? Just a customer, right? Yes, that must be it…\nRetreating back into hiding, Eliane tightened her grip on her parasol, swallowed hard, and observed the situation.\nUpon the beautiful maid's appearance, Glenn's sisters let out excited cries.\n\"Oh, it's Miss Lynn. Good afternoon!\"\n\"Miss Lynn, is Lord Louis not with you today?\"\nIn response to the innocent girls' words, the beautiful maid deadpanned a single line.\n\"Yes, Sir Louis has… become a constellation.\"\nAfter a few seconds of silence, Glenn spoke up.\n\"He's flying all over the country searching for candidates to be the next Sage, isn't he?\"\n\"Yes, I was being poetic in likening Lord Louis's appearance as he uses flight magic to soar through the sky like a shooting star.\"\n\"For a moment there, I thought Master had passed away.\"\nAs far as Eliane could gather from eavesdropping, it seemed that while the beautiful maid was indeed an acquaintance of Glenn's, their relationship was nothing more than that.\nAs Eliane breathed a sigh of relief, this time, a plainly dressed woman stopped in front of the Dudley Butcher Shop.\n\"Hello, Glenn. You seem well.\"\nThe plainly dressed woman had her chestnut-brown hair tied back, and in her arms, she carried a baby girl who appeared to be around one year old.\nWell, she's clearly not… one of them.\nThe woman had a child with her, and she seemed about ten years older than Glenn… Eliane let out a quiet, relieved breath.\nHowever, contrary to Eliane's expectations, Glenn's face lit up brightly.\n\"Mrs. Rosalie! Hello!\"\nGlenn's voice was clearly elated, and one could almost visualize him wagging his tail excitedly like a large dog… he was unmistakably overjoyed, and it was directed at that plain, motherly woman!\nIn the woman's arms, the baby girl, around one-year-old, let out indistinct \"Wah-wah\" sounds while reaching her small hands toward Glenn. Glenn effortlessly took the baby into his arms.\n\"Leonora, you've grown so big!\"\n\"Choo~\"\nThe baby girl clung to Glenn's head with her plump hands and planted a slobbery kiss on his cheek.\n\"Ahaha, that tickles~\"\n\"Choo~, choo~\"\nAs the innocent baby continued planting kisses, the beautiful maid muttered expressionlessly.\n\"Lord Louis would have a fit if he saw this.\"\n\"Eh, Master will…? Don't tell me he still can't properly hold a baby?\"\n\"Precisely that.\"\n\"…Whoa.\"\nEliane grimaced from her hiding spot, unable to approach the lively group.\nOh my, oh my, even though I went out of my way to come here, why is that person surrounded by other women? This makes it difficult for me to approach and speak to him. Look, my parasol is slightly poking out from my hiding spot, so shouldn't he notice me soon?\nAs she silently willed this from under her parasol, Glenn suddenly looked up.\nBut instead of noticing Eliane as she had hoped…\n\"…Oops, I need to get going!\" Glenn said. \"Ana, Betty, make sure you watch the shop!\"\nWith that, Glenn handed Leonora to the maid, levitated using flight magic, and rapidly ascended until he was above the rooftops. In the blink of an eye, he was completely out of sight.\nEliane trembled with frustration but could no longer hold back her voice.\n\"Aaah! What is this all about! You idiot, Lord Glennnnnnn!!\"\nHer voice did not reach him. Glenn had already flown far, far away into the distant sky.\nOh, how ridiculous this all was. She had even gone to the trouble of researching beforehand and traveled all this way, only to end up like this!\nAs she stood there dumbfounded, Glenn's sisters ran up to Eliane. Looking up at the flustered Eliane with innocent expressions, they asked,\n\"Were you just calling for our brother Glenn? Are you one of Glenn's friends?\"\n\"Those lovely clothes you're wearing… could you be from Serendia Academy?\"\n\"In-, Indeed…\"\nAs Eliane nodded awkwardly, the girls exclaimed excitedly:\n\"A princess!\"\n\"An actual princess!\"\n\"We had no idea Glenn had a princess friend from the academy!\"\n\"I want to hear all about Serendia Academy!\"\n\"Why don't you come have tea at our place while we wait for Glenn to come back!\"\n\"How wonderful! How wonderful! To have a princess visit our home!\"\nThe two girls excitedly took Eliane's hands and started walking toward the shop.\nAs the girls pulled her along, Eliane's eyes widened at the unexpected turn of events.\nWh-what is even happening?!\nIn the end, Eliane was welcomed into the Dudley household with meat dishes and barraged with questions from everyone until Glenn returned.",

      "content": "In the guest room of the guild where Lana Collete serves as the guild master, a newlywed couple had recently visited.\nThe couple's name was the Maywoods.\nNamely, Neil Clay Maywood and his wife Claudia.\n\"Congratulations on establishing the guild.\"\n\"Thank you! Welcome, even though it's far away.\"\nAs Lana smiled and offered tea, Claudia raised her cup and muttered in a low voice.\n\"It's on the way to our honeymoon…\"\nAt her as-usual tactless remark, Lana narrowed her eyes slightly and pursed her lips.\n\"You said ‘on the way', huh. Well, Southern Doll is a good place. It's lively with many rare items, perfect for a honeymoon, I think.\"\nThe port town of Southern Doll, where Lana established her guild, is one of the busiest in the Ridill Kingdom. With many people and goods coming and going, the stalls are lined with seafood and exotic items from abroad, always brimming with energy.\nNeil, sitting next to Claudia, took a sip of his teacup and said with a smile,\n\"I peeked at the market earlier and was surprised at how cheap the spices were. In our territory, they cost about ten times as much… Ah, this tea also uses spices, doesn't it?\"\n\"Yes, that's right. Brewing milk tea with spices has recently become popular among the nobles in the capital.\"\n\"Does your guild handle spices as well?\"\nAt Neil's question, Lana gave a slight wry smile.\nThe truth is that they're still struggling to deal with spices due to the many regulations on importing them.\n\"We don't have the leeway to deal with spices yet. Our main products are keeping us busy enough.\"\n\"…I heard you handle clothes and cosmetics.\"\nAt Claudia's words, Lana averted her eyes with an \"ugh\" expression, as if she had hit the mark.\nWhat the guild is currently mainly dealing with is not dresses or cosmetics for noble ladies. Of course, she wants to eventually expand into that area, but for now, Lana's main products are related to magic tools.\n\"That gaudy eyeglasses… Duke Anvard suggested it. He wanted us to wholesale the materials for magic tools.\"\nMore than a year ago, Lana had been running around collecting materials to help with the creation of the Black Chalice.\nThat was the catalyst that led to her developing close ties with Duke Barney Jones of Anvard.\nAbove all, the \"Black Chalice\" created by Monica had a huge impact on the magic tool industry. The publicity of having contributed to its production was extremely powerful advertising.\n\"Recently, I've been thinking of handling small magic tools for self-defense. You know, the old amulets were outdated in decoration or lacked sense, so they weren't very popular, right?\"\nSo Lana suggested to Barney to create decorative magic tools with designs that would be popular in the court.\nDefensive ornaments, or amulets, can be broadly divided into two types: those given to knights heading off to slay dragons, and those given by men to women.\nLana proposed designs for both men and women, taking into account practicality and trends. Surprisingly, Barney was enthusiastic about it, and prototypes would be made soon.\n\"And the robes for mages. Those incorporate spellwork, so they're a kind of magic tool, but the designs are too practical and, more importantly, not cute at all, right? So we're working on practical and cute robes as well…\"\n\"…Having Monica wear those would be excellent publicity, huh.\"\nTo Claudia's mutter, which could be taken as criticizing Lana for exploiting her friend, Lana readily replied, \"That's right.\"\nAs a businesswoman, Lana can't help but show her commercial instincts at times like this.\n\"But I also genuinely want Monica to wear cute robes. I was so surprised at how outdated the Seven Sages' robes looked when I saw them in person! And the sizes were completely off, too!\"\nAs Lana gripped her fists angrily, Neil smiled wryly and said, \"Come to think of it, she did have her robe adjusted a year ago, during that incident.\"\n\"Among magic practitioners, there's this idea that ‘old-fashioned = dignified' that's become too ingrained! With more young mages nowadays, magic tools and robes should definitely be fashionable, right?\"\nAs Lana passionately argued for the practicality and design of robes, there was a knock on the door, and the guild's male secretary called out to Lana about a visitor. Before Lana could ask about the visitor, a loud voice rang out:\n\"Lana, are you here? I brought a gift to celebrate the opening of your guild!\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\n\"Whoa, I'm surprised Neil and the others were here. I should've brought another ham if I'd known!\"\nThe ham Glenn brought as a gift to celebrate the guild's opening was truly magnificent.\nSeeing the huge chunk of ham, Claudia muttered softly,\n\"…Getting such a big ham during our honeymoon would be troublesome.\"\n\"Ah, maybe you prefer sausages instead?\"\nClaudia listlessly brushed off Glenn's words. The two weren't on bad terms, but their conversations somehow never clicked.\nAnyway, about the ham. Such a grand ham was too much for Lana to eat alone, but not enough to distribute among the servants.\nThen Lana had a good idea and snapped her fingers.\n\"Oh, I know. We might as well share it with Monica.\"\nAt those words, Glenn and Neil blinked in puzzlement, and Claudia tilted her head wearily.\n\"…I heard Silent Witch lives in the deep mountains?\"\n\"That information is outdated. Monica is living in Southern Doll now.\"\nLana smiled and looked out the window.\nMonica had come to Southern Doll a month ago.\nJust before that, Lana had also settled in Southern Doll to establish her guild, so she was quite surprised when Monica visited.\nUntil then, despite being one of the Seven Sages, Monica had been living in seclusion deep in the mountains, in a remote place a little away from the nearest village. She had food delivered once a month by the villagers.\nHowever, after unveiling the \"Black Chalice\" at the Supreme Council a year ago, Monica had to show her face not only at the royal palace but also at the Magic Tool Association, the Magician Association, Minerva, Duke Anvard's territory workshop, and so on. So she decided to move somewhere with better transportation access.\nThe reason Monica chose Southern Doll was not only for its convenient transportation but also because Lana was there… or so Lana believes, without being conceited.\nAfter all, Monica had said to her with a blush,\n‘I can't run a guild with you… but if you're handling magic tools at your guild, I think I can help out in various ways.'\nLana was so happy that she ended up hugging Monica, but that's a secret from Glenn and the others.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nFollowing Lana's lead, Glenn, Neil, and Claudia visited Monica's home, bringing the large ham as a gift.\nThe house where Monica lives is located in a relatively quiet residential area of the port town of Southern Doll.\nAlthough Lana and Monica try to have meals together or go to shops Lana recommends about once a week, and discuss products the guild will handle, Lana hadn't been able to visit Monica's home for the past week due to being busy with guild preparations.\n\"In that sense, food is the perfect gift. Monica tends to forget meals when she's absorbed in her research… As one of the Seven Sages, she should take on an apprentice to take care of her daily needs, or hire a servant!\"\n\"Eh, apprentices have to take care of their masters' daily needs!? I've never done that, you see!\"\nAt Glenn's words, Neil smiled vaguely and said, \"Well, different people, different strokes.\"\nEventually, they arrived at a cute brick house with a red roof.\nLana knocked on the door knocker familiarly… but there was no answer.\nNeil murmured, \"Maybe she's out,\" but a different possibility crossed Lana's mind.\n\"…Don't tell me… she's collapsed and sleeping on the floor again…\"\nWhile at Selendia Academy, Monica had maintained a relatively regular lifestyle. But her life as one of the Seven Sages was terrible.\nLana, as a guild master, also worked late into the night and sometimes fell asleep on the sofa out of exhaustion, but Monica was on another level.\nFinding her buried under piles of paper, sleeping like the dead, was an everyday occurrence.\nWorried, Lana turned the doorknob and the door opened easily. It seemed Monica was home after all.\n\"Monica, are you awake?\"\nUpon entering and opening the door, Lana's eyes widened in surprise.\n\"…Eh?\"\nThe last time she visited, there were piles of paper scattered all the way to the entrance, but now everything was neatly cleaned up. Documents and books were properly arranged on shelves, and a small vase on the desk held cute flowers.\nEverywhere you looked, it was a clean, homely house. Before, it didn't seem like a place where a human could properly live!\nAs Lana was thinking that Monica must have finally hired a housekeeper, someone came from the kitchen in the back of the room.\n\"Oh, visitors?\"\nLana's mouth fell open at the person.\nA glamorous honey-blonde with mysterious blue eyes. A sweet, well-formed beautiful face with slender, long legs.\n\"Ah, aah, you're…!\"\n\"Hey there, long time no see.\"\nSmiling warmly at them was Isaac Walker, the young man who had once called himself Felix Ark Ridill, the second prince of this country.",

      "content": "──Wrapped in a soft blanket, Monica was dozing off and dreaming.\nShe was walking along a familiar mountain trail, crunching the ground under her feet. Eventually, the mountain hut she remembered from nearly a year ago came into view, mostly unchanged from her memory. The only difference was perhaps the lack of a clothesline.\n\"I'm back,\" she said as she opened the door. The wind blew through the room, stirring up fine dust that sparkled in the sunlight.\nLooking around the interior, the stacks of scattered papers that had covered nearly a third of the space the last time she left were now significantly reduced. It seemed Lewis had instructed his subordinates to clean up a bit.\nMonica dusted off a thin layer from a wooden chair and sat down. Nero, in his cat form, looked up at her as if to ask, \"Aren't you going to clean?\"\nMonica gave an ambiguous response between \"yes\" and \"no\", feeling a bit dazed.\nShe had thought that when she could return to this mountain hut after completing her mission to guard the Second Prince, she would feel relieved.\nBut now that everything was over, the only thing in Monica's heart was a hollow emptiness.\nThis must be the feeling of loneliness. When was the last time she, who had been so terrified of people, felt such loneliness?\nMonica slowly stood up, opened the window, and began cleaning.\nAlthough it was tough to dust away a year's worth of accumulation, the reduced mountain of papers made the task more manageable. By sunset, she had swept away a decent amount of dust, though not enough to also wash the bedding.\n\"Tomorrow, I'll wash and dry the bedding,\" she thought. \"Oh, that's right. I need to find a long stick to use as a clothesline rod. If I can't find one, I'll have to use my staff, but Lewis would scold me if he found out,\" While pondering this, Monica lay down on the bed.\nThe bed should have smelled of dust and mold… but instead, Monica's nose detected the scent of a soft, sun-warmed blanket. This discrepancy from her memory told her, \"Ah, this is a dream…\"\nAh, that's right. This is a dream…\nIt was after spending a night on that dusty, moldy bed that Monica had decided to leave the mountain hut the next morning.\nAnd after nearly a year of preparations, she had visited Lana in Southern Doll and…\n\"Monica… no, Master, your friend has come to visit.\"\nSomeone's hand shook her shoulder.\nThe dream of the mountain hut faded, and Monica's consciousness drifted up like a fluffy cloud. As she snuggled into the soft blanket, she felt someone's breath on her ear.\n\"Would you like a wake-up kiss?\"\nAlong with the soft whisper, she felt a tender touch on her cheek.\nAh, that's right. It's Nero waking me up. Nero… is not there!\n\"It's… not paw pad!?\"\nMonica shot up with a start and heard a chuckle right next to her. Turning, she saw Isaac cradling the black cat Nero and laughing merrily.\nMonica asked nervously,\n\"Th-, That just now… wasn't a paw pad, was it?\"\n\"What do you think?\" Isaac teased in response.\nSeeking help, Monica looked to Nero, but he merely swished his tail in an exasperated manner.\n\"Hey, Monica. You're letting your disciple walk all over you. Be a bit firmer with him.\"\n\"But even he calls himself a disciple…\"\nAs Monica fidgeted with her bedhead, Isaac took two envelopes from his pocket and handed them to her.\n\"Letters arrived for you. The first is probably from Sir Ray Albright the Abyss Shaman, reporting that he's gotten engaged──I've heard rumors about that lately.\"\n\"Wha──Abyss Shaman is engaged? It's a happy occasion for him.\"\n\"And the other is likely an invitation to this year's chess tournament from Roberto Vinkel.\"\n\"Ugh, I just turned down the chess club advisor position too…\"\nCurrently, Roberto is a third-year Senior Division student at Serendia Academy. As president of the chess club, he has been actively participating in tournaments.\nRoberto frequently invites Monica to play chess, but it would be awkward for her to show up at Serendia Academy, where some students still recognize her face.\nThat said, Monica does enjoy playing chess with Roberto.\n\"Since he's inviting me so earnestly… I suppose a private game of chess would be okay…\"\nAs Monica mumbled this, Isaac's hand briefly paused where it was fixing her bedhead.\n\"If you want to play chess, I can be your opponent,\" he said, his voice tinged with stubbornness.\nMonica hummed vaguely in response, and Isaac, saying \"All done,\" let go of her hair.\n\"Oh, by the way, Monica. Your friends are waiting downstairs. Miss Colette, Dudley, and the Maywoods too.\"\n\"Wh-, what, everyone? W-, well, I'll be right down…!\"\nMonica hastily stood up and rushed out of the room in a flurry.\n＊ ＊ ＊\nFive days ago, Isaac had come to visit Monica.\nHaving been granted the title of Duke Erin, he was supposed to be living a quiet life away from the capital. But he showed up at Monica's door in simple traveling clothes, grinning as he said,,\n\"I want you to take me on as your disciple.\"\nMonica was so surprised, she nearly fell out of her chair. She shook her head vigorously.\n\"I-, I'm afraid can't. I'm not taking on any disciples, so… other than that… what about… your territory?\"\n\"My work is all done, you know?\"\n\"Bu-bu-bu-bu-but surely you can't… just leave your territory unattended… for long…\"\n\"I have a capable spirit looking after things while I'm away.\"\nIt seemed the water spirit who had served him at Serendia Academy was now working hard for him in a different capacity.\nMonica held her head, inwardly despairing.\nOn the surface, Isaac was Felix Ark Ridill, the Second Prince of the Ridill Kingdom, and Duke Erin.\nA year ago, during that incident, he had renounced his claim to the throne and now lived quietly in a territory away from the capital. But he was still of noble birth.\nIt was unheard of for one of the Seven Sages to take on a royal disciple.\n\"My attribute differs from the real Prince Felix, so I can't study magic at an institution like Minerva… But if I learn as ‘Isaac' under you, who knows the circumstances, there's no problem, right?\"\nWhat Isaac said made sense, but Monica couldn't just accept it so readily.\nAs Monica fretted, Isaac took a thick sheaf of papers from his bag.\n\"I've prepared some reports for my enrollment as your disciple. Here are the ones you looked over and I revised before, as well as some new ones.\"\nPutting aside the issue of him becoming her disciple, the mere mention of magic formulas immediately captured Monica's full attention.\nShe recalled telling him before revealing her true identity in Reinberg, \"I'd like to see more of your reports…\"\nThe revised reports he had shown her then were updated with the missing data and corrections for previous mistakes, additionally exploring new potential applications.\nAs for the new report, it contained Isaac's interpretations and proposed applications based on the advanced tracking spell Monica had recently published.\nThe academic consensus was that the spell's formulas were too complex for practical use except by those capable of chantless casting, like Monica herself.\nHowever, Isaac had outlined methods to simplify the spell's use while maintaining its power and accuracy through his unique perspective.\nIf we approach it this way, the formula itself becomes longer, but it would indeed be easier to understand… Or rather, incorporating it from this angle might actually increase the tracking speed further? I should test it out in practice…\nBefore she knew it, Monica had become completely engrossed in the reports, losing track of time.\nWhen she finally looked up after finishing, she was surprised to see that the previously cluttered room had been neatly tidied.\n\"…Huh? Eh?\"\nAll the documents were sorted and stacked neatly by type. The books that had been left strewn about were back on the shelves.\nAs Monica looked around the room in bewilderment, she noticed Nero had climbed onto the table and was munching on some grilled meat. The herb-seasoned chicken appeared deliciously crispy with a nicely browned skin.\n\"What's this, it's tasty! Hey, Sparkles. I didn't know you could cook,\" Nero remarked.\n\"I'm good at replicating techniques I've seen before. How about having another?\" Isaac replied. Without waiting for Nero's response, he added some more meat to his empty plate. His movements were those of someone well-practiced in service.\nSeeing this scene, Monica could only gape in astonishment.\n\"Ah, you're done reading, Monica?\" Isaac asked with a smile\n\"Y-, yes.\"\n\"I'd like to hear your thoughts, but first, why don't we have something to eat? There's herb-roasted chicken and soup. And for dessert, I made your favorite nutty cake.\"\nNow that he mentioned it, Monica had only had some bread and cheese since morning. As if just realizing her hunger, her stomach let out an embarrassing growl.\nIsaac let out a soft chuckle and said, \"I'll bring it right out\" before disappearing into the kitchen.\nThe juicy, fragrant meat, the velvety smooth soup, and the crispy nut-filled cake. Everything was far more delicious than what Monica could make herself.\nTo begin with, Monica rarely cooked elaborate meals. At most, she would slice some bread and cheese, giving it a light sear.\nHaving not enjoyed such a well-prepared meal in a long time, Monica and Isaac ended up discussing the reports deep into the night. Eventually, Monica dozed off slumped over the table.\nWhen she awoke, she found herself in bed, with Isaac nonchalantly preparing breakfast as if it were the natural thing to do.\nAfter hastily devouring that meal, they continued their discussion… Before long, Monica had completely forgotten to ask Isaac to leave.\nThis is what is known as an \"uninvited disciple.\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nWhen Monica went downstairs, Lana, Glenn, Neil, and Claudia were having tea around a table.\nUpon seeing Monica, Lana looked up with a flustered expression.\n\"Monica! Hey, what's going on here? Why is that man being your disciple?\"\n\"Well, there are, um, complex circumstances…\"\nTo put it plainly, she had been lured in. There were no profound reasons.\nOf course, one major factor was that Isaac did possess the qualities of a magician.\nHe had ample mana and a keen understanding of magic formulas. More importantly, he was an enthusiastic learner.\nHaving studied magic independently until now, Isaac lacked people to discuss and consult with on the subject. But by finding Monica as a conversation partner, he was like a fish who had found water, brimming with vitality.\nHow could Monica bring herself to simply turn him away? Especially when his cooking was so delicious.\nMonica took a seat at the table, just as Isaac came down the stairs. After quickly scanning the table to check the tea levels, he smiled at Monica.\n\"You prefer coffee in the morning, right? Give me a moment and I'll brew some fresh. Esteemed guests, please feel free to have some as well. I've acquired some excellent beans recently.\"\n\"U-, um, Ike, I can do it, myself, so…\"\n\"It's fine, you can relax and chat with your friends.\"\nAs Monica started to rise, Isaac gently pushed her back into her seat before swiftly clearing away the empty dishes and retreating to the kitchen. His flowing movements were those of an experienced butler.\nClaudia murmured as she sipped her tea, \"…If the people of this country knew their Second Prince had become an uninvited disciple to a witch, acting as a servant no less… I wonder how many would faint on the spot?\"\n\"Ugh…\"\n\"…He was always said to be perfect at anything back in his student days, but seeing his perfection extend from tea brewing and serving to dish arrangement and even cake flavor… It's almost laughable.\"\nMonica could only respond with an \"Aughh…\" She couldn't very well add that his cleaning skills were also impeccable.\nGlenn swallowed a mouthful of cake and washed it down with tea before letting out a satisfied \"Puahh!\"\n\"President's amazing! I've never made tea for Master's guests before!\"\n\"Ugh… Sorry for being such an inadequate master…\"\n\"Eh!? No, I didn't mean to blame you, Monica!\"\nAs Glenn flustered with his excuse, there was a knock at the door accompanied by a cool, crisp breeze flowing in through a nearby window. A wind infused with mana, different from a summer breeze.\nSensing this, Monica rose and hurried to the entrance.\nAfter briefly adjusting her bangs and taking a deep breath, she opened the door.\n\"W-Welcome, Lord Cyril.\"\nAs expected, it was Cyril Ashley standing there.\nCyril's blue eyes blinked slightly as he looked at Monica. \"You could tell it was me?\"\n\"Well, I heard you were going to visit soon, so…\"\nMonica made sure to keep the windows near the entrance open only when she expected Cyril's arrival. That way, she would immediately know when the cool crisp air signaled his presence.\nAfter guiding Cyril inside, he widened his eyes at the lively gathering of guests.\n\"So Claudia and the others are here too.\"\n\"…We're on our honeymoon and stopped by for a visit. But you, dear older brother…\"\nLeaving a deliberate pause, Claudia gave a beautiful smile before uttering a single remark,\n\"…must be quite idle these days.\"\nA vein throbbed at Cyril's temple as he pulled a stack of documents from his bag and placed them on the table.\n\"I'm here on business, as you're well aware. The House of Highon is currently engaged in a joint research project with Thorn Witch and Silent Witch on plant enhancements. I've come today to get her input on the fertilizer formulations.\"\n\"Ah, yes, I have the materials ready.\"\nThe necessary documents had been organized with tabs by Isaac for easy reference. Monica checked the contents before handing them to Cyril.\n\"Here are the calculated fertilizer blend compositions and samples. I've provided the same to Thorn Witch as well. And, um…\"\n\"…? What is it?\"\nMonica chose her words carefully so as not to provoke Cyril.\n\"…Lord Thorn Witch has apparently taken an interest in the Imperial Magic Technology University…\"\n\"Ah, the Empire is more advanced than our kingdom when it comes to supplementary magic research.\"\n\"So, he said…\n‘I'm gonna go undercover as a student there for a bit!'\"\nCyril's eyes widened in shock and he fell silent.\nNo matter how diplomatically Monica phrased it, the reality didn't change.\nWhen she had previously mentioned to Raul Roseburg, the Thorn Witch, about how she had infiltrated Serendia Academy in disguise, he had exclaimed with sparkling eyes,\n‘Living undercover as a student? That sounds fun! I want to try being a student too!'\nAt the time, Monica had thought he was joking. But just a few weeks later, Raul had completed all the paperwork for his enrollment.\nWhen he proudly declared at the Seven Sages Council meeting, \"I'll be a student next year too!\", Louis Miller, who was frantically searching for a new Sage candidate, nearly assaulted him (thankfully, Bradford restrained the rampaging Louis with a full nelson).\nNo matter how delicately Monica worded it, Cyril could only gape speechlessly.\nHurriedly, Monica tried to reassure him,\n\"B-But he said he'll continue the joint research from his study location and provide regular updates!\"\n\"I'm starting to worry about the future of this country…\"\nCyril's mutter left Monica stammering, \"Aughh…\"\nAfter all, one of the Seven Sages' seats was already vacant. And now, another Sage was going on an undercover study abroad.\n‘Maybe we should just rename ourselves the Five Sages while we're at it? We could dispense with the Thorn Witch's seat entirely,'\nLouis had cheerfully suggested, though his eyes were not smiling. It was possible that within a few years, the Seven Sages really would be reduced in number.\nWhile Cyril looked dejected, he knew it was pointless to blame Monica. He let out a sigh and pinched the bridge of his nose before speaking.\n\"For now, I should hear the full story directly from Sir Thorn Witch as well… And this is a separate matter, but…\"\nHe trailed off, glancing briefly toward the kitchen.\n\"He is here, isn't he?\"\n\"Yes…\"\nMonica nodded with a wry smile at Cyril's serious query.\nClaudia, Glenn, Lana, and Neil watched the exchange in silence. Claudia was expressionless, Glenn looking confused, and Lana and Neil swallowing nervously.\nEventually, Isaac emerged from the kitchen carrying a tray with a coffee cup.\nUpon seeing Cyril, Isaac tilted his head demurely.\n\"Oh, did you want another cup as well?\"\n\"Why are you here?\"\nIsaac answered Cyril's low, grating tone with a smile.\n\"Well, I'm Silent Witch's disciple. It's only natural for me to attend to my master's guests, isn't it?\"\nCyril responded with a solemn expression.\n\"…Before coming here, I visited Duke Erin's estate and your contracted spirit pleaded for my assistance.\"\n\"Ah, Willdean does tend to worry too much… It's not that unusual for a noble to live at their city residence while leaving their rural estate unattended, is it?\"\nIsaac did have a point. There were indeed nobles who preferred living in the capital and rarely returned to their rural domains. But at the very least, this place was not the capital, and what Isaac was doing amounted to being an uninvited disciple.\n\"I was surprised to hear you had moved in with Monica when I thought you were in the capital. Southern Doll may have good transportation links, but…\"\nAt Cyril's words, a slight twitch tugged at the corner of Isaac's mouth.\n\"Now hold on a moment. Since when did you start calling Monica by just her name?\"\n\"…? Given her awkwardness with formal titles like ‘Madam Everett', I considered how she would prefer to be addressed as a former Serendia student and determined she wished to go by her given name.\"\n\"…Is that so?\"\nWas it just Monica's imagination, or did a chill seem to emanate from Isaac now, rather than the usually frosty Cyril?\nSir Cyril seems troubled, so as his master, I should firmly scold Isaac…\nFurrowing her brow in an attempt at a stern expression, Monica tugged at Isaac's coat hem.\n\"Ike, you see…\"\n\"What is it? My master looks adorable no matter what face she makes. Just like a little squirrel.\"\nSo much for trying to be a stern mentor. He had compared her to a cute animal instead.\nA bit deflated but still determined, Monica persisted.\n\"You really should… focus on your work, okay? Mmph!\"\nMonica had tried her utmost to look intimidating, but Isaac only studied her intently.\nWhy was he staring at her so fixedly? Did she have errant bedhead hair? Monica fidgeted, patting her own head self-consciously.\nFinally, Isaac gave her a warm smile.\n\"Don't worry, all my work is taken care of.\"\nAs if on cue, Cyril smoothly pulled out a thick stack of documents from his bag, nearly three times as thick as the materials Monica had provided earlier.\n\"These are additional assignments. Furthermore, Prince Albert will soon be going on a hunting excursion with a neighboring dignitary, and Diplomat Bridget Graham has requested your attendance as well.\"\n\"…Doesn't everyone have rather high expectations of an exiled former Second Prince living in seclusion?\"\n\"It is precisely because you are so trusted, Your Highness. By myself as well, of course.\"\nIsaac sighed and rubbed his forehead at Cyril's earnest demeanor.\n\"You still insist on calling me ‘Your Highness' even though you know my true identity… You never change, do you?\"\n\"Regardless of your circumstances, the fact remains that you are someone I deeply respect.\"\nCyril puffed out his chest with pride.\nMeanwhile, Claudia, sipping her tea silently at the table, did not change her expression at all as her azure eyes moved between the two men.\nIsaac tried to deflect Cyril's serious manner, and the ever-earnest Cyril refused to be dissuaded. And caught in the middle was the hapless Monica, buffeted by her disciple.\nMonica revered Cyril. Cyril revered Isaac. And Isaac revered Monica… It was a veritable triangle of reverence.\n\"…A novel love triangle, indeed,\" Claudia murmured.\nLana whispered back as she drank her tea, \"Hey, is this supposed to be… a confrontation?\"\n\"…Two of the three are oblivious. With one self-aware party, the situation is quite precarious…\"\nOf course, the byplay between the two was lost on the flustered Monica, who focused only on convincing Isaac.\n\"Ike, troubling Sir Cyril and Willdean is unacceptable!\"\n\"So my master won't take my side?\"\n\"Work is important, you know!\"\n\"Alright, I'll return to the estate once a month then. Is that acceptable?\"\n\"Good!\"\nMonica heaved a relieved sigh, unaware that she had just provided Isaac justification to keep imposing himself as her disciple outside of those monthly visits to his estate.\nAs she sank back into her chair, the exasperated Lana gave Monica a wry look.\n\"You've got your hands full too, Monica.\"\n\"Do… I?\"\nIt was true that recently, Monica's life had been a constant stream of unfamiliar situations.\nLooking back, her whirlwind began when she left the mountain hut to undertake the mission of guarding the Second Prince.\nIn the past, the timid Monica had lived in fear of others' gaze, keeping her head down and mouth shut as she devoted herself solely to numbers and formulas, believing that was all her life would ever amount to, with no other prospects to hope for.\nSo even after making dear friends by infiltrating Serendia Academy, she had intended to quietly disappear once those memories were made.\nBack then… I really thought I could give it all up.\nBut the current Monica found herself unable to relinquish everything.\nThere were things she didn't want to let go of. People she wanted to stay connected to.\nMonica gave a small, rueful smile at how greedy she had become compared to her former self.\n\"It may be difficult, but… I'm glad I left that mountain hut.\"\nInitially, she had been practically dragged out by Louis.\nBut after it was all over, Monica had made the choice herself to venture out again from the hut.\n\"I'm happy… now to have people to share coffee with.\"\n\"So basically, Monica likes coffee, huh!\" Glenn cheerfully remarked.\nAs Lana shook her head in exasperation, Monica smiled warmly.\n\"Yes… having coffee together with everyone… is delicious.\"\n\"I get that feeling! Eating meat with everyone is the best too! Next time, I'll bring some tasty meat so we can have a meat party!\"\nNeil grinned at Glenn's suggestion. \"Sounds great!\"\n\"Please allow us to join as well. Is that right, Claudia?\"\n\"A harbor town, yet focused on meat rather than fish…\"\n\"We can just grill both meat and fish, no problem!\"\nAs Glenn energetically proposed the idea, Isaac smiled as he sipped his coffee.\n\"Sounds good. I'll have to show off my skills then.\"\nWith Isaac's deftness, he could surely prepare delicious meat or fish dishes.\nHowever, his comment drew a sharp look from Cyril.\n\"Wait, you don't mean… to suggest His Highness… will be… cooking?\"\nCyril's fork clattered as he stiffened, prompting Claudia to smirk devilishly as she gestured to the plate before him with a slender finger.\n\"…The plum cake you just ate was also made by… him.\"\nInstantly, Cyril shot up from his chair, his eyes burning intensely as he glared at Monica.\n\"Monica Everett! Surely you don't mean to say you've been treating His Highness like a servant by having him…\"\n\"N-No, it's a misunderstanding…! Well, he does help with cleaning too, so not a misunderstanding…\"\n\"He even has cleaning duties!?\"\nCyril's brows furrowed deeper and deeper. Ah, that familiar irate expression!\nAs Monica quivered anxiously, Isaac calmly interjected.\n\"As Monica's disciple, it's only natural that I handle her personal affairs.\"\n\"Personal affairs as well!?\"\n\"I'm quite deft at styling her hair. Not as skilled as Lady Colette.\"\nAt Isaac's remark, Lana gave Monica a deadpan stare.\n\"Monica, I have to question that from a female perspective.\"\n\"Waaahh, I'm so sorry! I normally do it myself, but I was so absorbed in my research recently…!\"\n＊ ＊ ＊\nOh, Oh, it's quite lively today.\nNero, who had been secretly observing the scene from the top of the stairs, gave a lazy swish of his tail.\nThat said, a meat party doesn't sound too bad. I better make sure to get my fair share of meat too.\nWith that thought, Nero scampered up the stairs and into the open study. Intending to pass the time with some reading until the guests departed, he pulled Dustin Gunther's latest novel, which recently arrived from overseas, off the bookshelf.\nAs Nero flipped open the cover with his front paw in content, a message card fluttered out.\n──Devoted to the Quiet Witch.\nNero narrowed his golden eyes and let out a cackling laugh.\n\"It's far from a word ‘quite' if we're talking about her current life.\"\nOn that tranquil summer afternoon in the harbor town, the lively chatter from downstairs accompanied Nero as he lazily turned the pages.\nHey everyone, thanks so much for reading Silent Witch to the end. It took 3 years to complete. Thanks to your support, I can keep my motivation up. I decide to take a rest for a while before taking on another project. Perhaps several days until I found another interesting novel. I hope we can meet again in another project.\nThank you!!",

That's the ending I wanted to depict from the very beginning when I started writing. I'm relieved that I was able to reach that point safely.\nFor a little over six months, I continued writing almost every day, and it was a very enjoyable time.\nAlthough this work has reached its ending, I still have many stories I want to write, such as tales about the colorful Vinkel brothers, the story of the Abyss Shaman getting engaged, the story of the Thorn Witch studying abroad in disguise, the story of a new young female president being tossed around by her childhood friend, or stories set in modern-day Japan or in a completely different fantasy world. Why can't I use a clone technique?\nFor a while, I won't be able to dedicate myself to writing, but eventually, when I have time, I hope I can write little by little.\nIt would be my pleasure if we could meet again somewhere in another work.\nIsora Matsuri\nThe Novel will be updated first on this website. Come back and continue reading tomorrow, everyone!",
