      "content": "On a certain mountaintop, high above the clouds, a hero and a villain were having a grand battle.\n“Take this—[Holy Infinite Beaming Sword of Banishing the Nasty Darkness]!”\n“Hah, that is nothing against my [Aegis of Divine Darkness for Repelling Pesky Heroes]!”\nGrand spells and abilities were flying every which way, tearing apart the landscape and slicing up the clouds below. It was a very grand battle indeed—one that would decide the fate of the world.\nBut did it\nreally\nmatter? Like,\nreally really?\nBecause… the fate of the world was constantly shifting this way and that. There was always balance. Another hero and another villain. Yes, it was the fate of the world, but…\nOnly for like—30 years or so, probably.\nThe record was half a year before a new villain rose up. A rather short eternity of peace that turned out to be.\nTherefore, it really was not\nthat\nspecial of a battle. Similar battles had been fought before. Similar battles would be fought again.\nWhichever side won; the other side would eventually strike back.\nUltimately, it was a pointless story that would lead nowhere.\nLuckily, they are not the main characters of this story. In fact, they will be left as mere footnotes in history, while our hero will lead a much grander tale.\nOn the violently shaking mountaintop sat a stone. It was a nice stone—a gneiss stone in fact. It might have been more accurate to call it a pebble. The type of pebble a child might take along due to its nice shape and pretty coloring. This pebble was spending its time as stones tended to, minding its own business. The racket nearby was quite annoying, and it wished that it could get some peace and quiet.\nThat however threw the stone for a loop—wishing for peace and quiet? Since when had it wished for anything? Since when had it had thoughts anyways? The stone strained its mind but could only recall a long time spent in comfortable silence. Was this awareness a new thing?\nIt was.\nJust a few minutes ago, one of the hero’s stray spells had hit this very pebble, causing some strange changes to come over it. The pebble found the situation quite odd and wished it could go back to the relaxing state it had previously been enjoying.\nWho wanted to be\naware\nof eternity spent waiting on a mountaintop?\nAs it tried to relax its mind, the pebble noticed a strange screen hovering in front of it. Had that been there before? No—it had to be new. Curious, the pebble focused on the little grey box.\n[Unnamed]\nTitle(s)\n:\nNone\n🗿\nHP\n: 1/1\nMana\n: 0/0\nLevel\n: 0\nExperience\n: 0/10\nClass\n: None\nSub-class\n: None\nRace\n: Gneiss Stone\nGold\n: 0\nSTATS\nDiameter (d)\n: 0.06m\nMass (m)\n: 0.3kg\nVelocity (v)\n: 0 m/s => [0,0,0]\nABILITIES\nCollide\nCrash into a foe and inflict damage equal to\nm\n* Δ\nv / 4\n.\nBounceback damage is reduced.\nThe stone found the screens rather curious—it somehow understood the contents. It understood that the screens were referring to itself in some way, and that they indicated that the pebble was not a very mighty pebble currently.\nThat thought saddened the pebble somewhat.\nNow that it was aware of things, it considered itself superior to all the other pebbles around, but its statistics indicated anything but!\nThe pebble was not quite sure how it observed its surroundings, but somehow it did just that. All around it, other stones lay about—many quite a bit larger than itself.\nThe pebble did not like that.\nIt wanted to be the best of all stones.\nJust then, as it was deep in thought, a new screen appeared in front of it.\nTutorial Quest Assigned\nRoll out\nReach the bottom of the mountain.\nCurrent Altitude\n: 10 000m\nDifficulty\n: Legendary\nRewards\n: ??? (Legendary)\nWhat was this?\nA quest! A grand, heroic, quest! The pebble was ready to set forth towards danger, to seek out the mysterious rewards it could receive, when it suddenly recalled a poignant detail. It was a stone, and stones did not tend to move about too much.\nA trap! A jest! A taunt! Who would be so cruel as to assign a monumental task like that to an immobile pebble? Oh greatest of sins, what cruelty!\n“Go, [Heroic Homing Overpowered Lazer of Atomic Water Bonds]!”\n“You fool, all water is atomic, you cannot penetrate my [Impenetrable Shield of Darkness that Cannot be Penetrated]!”\nOf course, the battle was still raging in the background.\nJust as the pebble was about to fall into a deep depression, a blast of energy was deflected near it, and it was launched into the air.\nThe pebble was perplexed—it was\nmoving\n!\nFor the first time ever, the pebble moved from that place!\nIt rather enjoyed the feel of it and noticed a change on its stats screen as its flight passed its apex.\nSTATS\nDiameter (d)\n: 0.06m\nMass (m)\n: 0.3kg\nVelocity (v)\n: 26.13 m/s => [3, 7, -25]\nThe numbers had gotten bigger! Overjoyed, the pebble realized that it should do this fly-about thing more—anything that made the numbers grow was surely a good thing. Perhaps it could even advance on its quest?\nThe pebble then noticed that its flight was nearing its end, as it was flying right at the head of some strange, red-skinned creature. The creature seemed to be engaged in battle with another white-clad one. And the pebble was flying right at the red creature's hea—\nBonk\nCollide activated!\n[Unnamed]\nDealt\n0,3\n* 13.1 / 4 = 1 dmg\nto\n[Demon Lord Diablos]\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 13.01 m/s => [1.4, 12.3, -4]\nThe red-skinned creature flinched for a second as a pebble hit it in the face, allowing the white-clad one to plunge its sword deep into the creature’s chest.\n“This isn’t over... I will resurrect in 666 years, and then humanity will be doomed!”\n“Heh, I don’t care. The isekai office only contracted me for\none\ndemon lord. I’m saying goodbye to this shitty world.”\nSome more words were spoken, but the pebble was already far away, rolling down the mountain. Soon, a notification appeared in front of it once again.\nYou have assisted in defeating\n[Demon Lord Diablos!]\n500 000 Assist experience granted!\nYou have gained the title:\nEnemy of Demons\n!\nEffects: 20% Greater damage dealt to demons, 20% more experience from killing demons, permanent hostility with all demons!\nLevel up!\n500 000 / 10 xp\nDiscarding overflow xp\nYou have reached level 1!\nStats up!\nMass (m)\n: 0.3kg -> 1.0kg\nDiameter (d)\n: 0.06m -> 0.09m\nHP:\n1 -> 1\n[Unnamed]\nTitle(s)\n: Enemy of Demons\n🗿\nHP\n: 1/1\nMana\n: 0/0\nLevel\n: 1\nExperience\n: 0/20\nClass\n: None\nSub-class\n: None\nRace\n: Gneiss Stone\nGold\n: 0\nIt had grown!\nImmense joy filled the pebble as it noticed that it had become a larger pebble. This was the start of a path to greatness! It celebrated for quite a while as it rolled down, then finally noticed more screens.\nYou are eligible for the class:\nRolling Stone\nAccept the class? Y/N\nA class?\nThe pebble slowly considered each new screen as it flashed by and judged that it indeed did want to be a Rolling Stone. To be quite frank, it already was one–the pebble was making good speed down the mountain.\nThe pebble focused on the prompt and accepted the class.\nCongratulations!\nYou are now a level 1\nRolling Stone\n!\nNew Ability Gained!\nSteer\nSubtly shift acceleration vector into desired direction\nThe pebble parsed its new ability and stats and felt satisfied. It had grown bigger! Moreover, it had received some sort of new, complicated ability. It didn't quite know what an acceleration or a vector was but had time to learn. It would experiment.\nEventually.\nA stone was a patient one after all.\nThe pebble continued rolling down the mountain, eagerly awaiting a chance to test out its new ability. It rolled onward to its grand quest.\nDown the mountain.\nTowards the unknown, dark horizon.\nTo where no pebble had gone before (probably).\nAnd so, a brave hero set forth, as many had done before.\nThis is its story.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 9 673m",

      "content": "As fast as it had gotten started, the [Rolling Stone’s] journey came to an end.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 9 253m\nVelocity (v)\n: 0 m/s => [0, 0, 0]\nThe pebble… had gotten stuck.\nA cruel twist of fate, but also a somewhat inevitable one. All heroes need great trials to surpass, like the great titan who was sentenced to eternally push a rock up a mountain.\nHowever, therein lay the issue. Our pebble had no push of its own.\nAs it had flown down from that great mountaintop, cast off in the clash of titans, it had been overjoyed. Such speed! Such process! It could watch the quest ticker tick down, and the velocity stat tick up. The numbers just kept getting bigger!\nFaster and faster it had rolled, gathering speed and momentum, speeding down the mountain.\nUntil it had seen a target.\nA queer sort of animal, with two long ears which twitched about happily as it observed its surroundings. Then the pebble remembered two things.\n1. It could grow larger by hitting things in the head really hard.\n2. And it could [Steer].\nSteer activated!\nSteering to the [Right]\nAt that moment, its [Velocity] had been great indeed, so the pebble had begun using its new skill, subtly altering its [Acceleration] vector, gradually adjusting course towards the furred creature. The creature just sat in place, a lone challenger for the rock, standing near a mighty cliff. The pebble saw its lack of motion, and knew the enemy to be inferior.\nThat was when it erred. For a pebble has rather limited awareness—it did not know of things like smell, taste, or... well, sound. It neared the target, bounced off a rock, and—\nAn ear twitched. A rabbit hopped—and dodged.\nAnd a rock thudded hard against stone, getting lodged between two boulders, a great chasm under it. But it was no longer falling. It was no longer moving.\nStuck.\nThe very-much-so-not-[Rolling Stone] began gathering moss.\nA familiar feeling, really. It had spent most of eternity doing that, so it was in a way a return to normalcy. Retirement after a great career of adventure. It had gone where few rocks had gone before, uncharted waters, and managed to reach level 1. Not anything to be ashamed of.\nProud, the pebble looked back on the folly of youth, and sat back to enjoy its retirement.\nAnd the seasons changed.\nFirst came the chill winds of autumn. Great gales blew, but no fall leaves traveled up here. The mountaintop was a barren, dry place. Far removed from any of the brilliant foliage down below. A high-up desert, with no mirages or oases offering hope to lost travelers. But the rock did not need hope, it did not thirst for water.\nIt was a rock. Calmly, it enjoyed the cool breeze against its stony exterior, like man might enjoy a warm hearth and home.\nThen came the snow of winter, and the rock got buried under, frozen stiff. It had felt the sensation before, and though the ice chilled the pebble to the core, it did not despair. It was a stone. A bit of cold meant nothing to it.\nBut—as all retired adventurers know—eventually the call of adventure comes once again.\nThe snow began melting.\nSlowly—oh so slowly—things began to\nmove.\nTo\nchange.\nFirst, the packed frost turned to slush, only a thin film of ice sealing the pebble inside its tomb. Then water began flowing down the mountain in great torrents, and the lowlands despaired at the floods. But the pebble… it sensed an opportunity.\nIt awoke from its retirement. Went down to the cellar, grabbed the old heirloom sword, and started sharpening it.\nFor war was in the air.\nIt was ready, waiting to pounce forward when finally it happened. Softened to mud and silt by the torrential downpour, the dirt holding up the great boulders, and holding the pebble in place\nshifted\n.\nJust a hint. But enough. The stone began to gradually move forward. Then it fell, finally free from its bindings. Down, down into the chasm, its great journey began anew.\nIt had vengeance in its mind. The sword was sharpened.\nBecause... a certain rabbit was enjoying the fresh bounty of spring berries right down below. A lucky twist of fate? Such things were patterns. An enemy not put down will always return with a sharper stake. And the pebble had been watching, carefully.\nThe pebble used [Steer], and its downward [Acceleration] vector began gradually shifting to the side, with a precision born of endless patience, and a touch on the wheel that would not shake no matter the circumstance.\nAnd there was no sound. Just a silent fall through the air.\nUntil there was.\nTHUD\nCollide activated!\n[Unnamed]\nDealt\n1 * 20.1 / 4 = 5 dmg\nto\n[Common Rabbit]\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 13.01 m/s\nA rabbit with a skull split in two fell to the ground, above the fresh spring berries, which also got crushed under the patient adversary.\nYou have gained the title:\nPatient Ambusher\nEffects: Deal greater damage to foe proportional to how long you have been lying in wait.\nAnd once more, the pebble started rolling down. Moss was shed, and the kinks of a long rest were worked out. And it began hunting.\nBecause… a patient hunter could also be rather vengeful. The stone had spent a long two seasons up on the cliff, watching the happenings down in the chasm. And it had seen the rabbit’s wintery romance, and the brood it had produced.\nThe rabbit had cast the first stone. But only that first stone mattered, for it could easily shift [Momentum], and begin rolling back, towards the opposite direction.\nWith the inevitability of a rolling boulder, the pebble began [Steering] in a direction it knew very well indeed.\nIt rolled over craggy exposed rock and freshly blooming grass, over dirt and trickles of water, towards a little burrow in the cliffside. Towards the little rabbits frolicking in the spring air.\nAn ear twitched, and a young, curious eye turned towards the approaching avenger. With the arrogance of youth, a rabbit hopped to the side, easily dodging out of the way.\nOr so it thought. But this pebble…\nIt did not forget. It had watched.\nIt was moving fast, accelerating as it moved down the mountainside, and with a small and well placed [Steer], right at the perfect moment…\nThe pebble cracked into a skull, midair.\nCollide activated!\n[Unnamed]\nDealt\n1 * 5.2 / 4 = 1 dmg\nto\n[Newborn Rabbit]\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 20 m/s\nThen it ricocheted off, and [Steered] towards the next, who did not suspect a mere pebble could move on its own.\nAnother skull cracked.\nIn a desperate escape, the little bunnies hopped down the mountain, instinctively fleeing along with gravity as their boost. A concerned mother joined them.\nBut a stone rolled. It did not falter in the chase. And they were running downhill. More calm [Steering].\nSplat. Splat. Splat.\nThree rabbits went down, skulls bashed in by a vengeful stone. Vain attempts at fleeing, all for naught.\nYou have gained the title:\nLine-Ender!\nEffects: 20% Bonus damage to attacks ending family lines!\nLevel up!\n25 / 20 xp\nDiscarding overflow xp\nYou have reached level 2!\nStats up!\nMass (m)\n: 1.0kg -> 3.3kg\nDiameter (d)\n: 0.09m -> 0.14m\nHP:\n1 -> 2\nThe pebble reveled in the sensation of growth, the sweet ambrosia of numbers going up. This was good. This was\nright.\nCoated in blood and stuck with fur, the pebble kept rolling down and down—eventually arriving once more to an area of deceleration. A cliff of flatland, and its momentum…\nIt ran out just before the pebble managed to reach the next cliff's edge.\nHad our hero gotten stuck again?\nNo, because the scent of war was still thick in the air. Thickest here of all.\nFor this was no ordinary cliffside. Small green figures were assembled on two sides of the cliff, red eyes gleaming, and weapons pointed in each other’s directions. A site of imminent battle.\nAnd the cracking of a stone hitting the ground from up above served as the starting shot. Warcries rang out all around the rock, projectiles started flying, and the green figures started rushing at each other, fury clouding their minds.\nThis too was a site of vengeance.\nTwo lines of fighters collided, with a pebble sitting right in the middle. Arms were hacked off and figures fell down in cries of pain, pools of blood expanding to coat the clifftop.\nFor a brief moment, the pebble hoped that the tide of blood would carry it forward, and restart its journey down the mountain. But alas—as was the fate of heroes…\nAlthough they were not always willing—war tended to find them.\nA green figure fell down by the rock, clutching at an arm with an arrow embedded in it. Growls of pain, but a relentless determination born of long-held hate. It saw a perfectly sized rock, and picked it up. And threw.\nThe [Rolling Stone] moved once again.\nAnd [Steered].\nStraight into the fires of war.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 8 673m\nFull Status:\n[Unnamed]\nTitle(s)\n:\nTitle(s)\n:\nLine-Ender, Patient Ambusher, Bane of Demons\n🗿\nHP\n: 2/2\nMana\n: 0/0\nLevel\n: 2\nExperience\n: 0/40\nClass\n: Rolling Stone\nSub-class\n: None\nRace\n: Gneiss Stone\nGold\n: 0\nSTATS\nDiameter (d)\n: 0.14m\nMass (m)\n: 3.3kg\nABILITIES\nCollide\nSteer",

      "content": "Grogg the level 3 [Skirmisher] fell down on the field, an arrow in his arm. It hurt\noh\nso much, but he gritted his teeth, and rose up—only for another arrow to swish right above his head.\n“Bastards!”\nScreaming, growling, he threw himself down, the wooden spear at his back useless. He could not get close! The foes were relentless with their ammunition!\nThe melee fighters had pulled off each other after the initial skirmish, and half of them now lay dead, dripping a rich river of crimson onto the windy hilltop. The others were staying back to nurse their wounds, letting the ranged fighters take control of the field.\nBut they could not take it back. All charges broke against the barrage of arrows.\nGrogg felt despair and rage gripping him, all his hard training—useless! He could not even get close enough to poke his spear in! He rolled to the side, dodging another arrow, then saw the pebble on the ground.\nA pebble that was… the perfect size. Covered in grime, but the\nheft\nof it… Grogg’s youth ran through his mind.\nOnce, before the fiends before him had slaughtered his kin like animals—\nhe had played a game with his brother.\nA simple game of children, throwing rocks.\nSlowly, playing dead, Grogg reached out and grabbed the pebble. A stone that was really... just nice. Had circumstances been different, he would have started a rock collection then and there. A bit on the heavier side, but that only made him smile.\nMore damage.\nLightning fast, he jumped to his feet, hefting the stone up with once-mastered technique, somehow still stored deep inside his muscles. With a prayer to heaven, he readied himself for the throw of his life.\nThis one’s for you, Grugg.\nHe pitched the stone forward, but the wound at his arm made him stumble at the last moment, and he lost his footing. The throw went off course, and Grogg yelled out a curse, falling back down to the ground. Arrows were thick in the air, but he still focused on that pebble, cursing how it was… not going off course? His eyes widened, and the rage of battle faded as he focused on that miraculous flight.\nGradually, with eerie precision, the rock’s trajectory changed. Rightward and rightward, and then when a wide-eyed goblin tried to dodge, it unerringly followed the sideward jump. A smashing hit right to the skull.\nGrogg jumped up, heart filled with newfound faith, and praised all the Gods and Goddesses of the world. “My brother! Your spirit of vengeance still lives on!”\nThen he paused. A goblin on the other side had picked the pebble up, and was aiming it at\nhim\n.\nChuckling confidently, Grogg fell into a ready crouch, wound up. Because he was ready, he would not be caught unaware. He would zig if it zagged, zag if it zigged. The foe hefted the pebble up, spinning it around in his hand, and then the rock was thrown, right at him.\nHe used [Skirmisher’s Dodge], and leaped five feet to the side in one bounding step.\nHe landed on his side, head up, searching for that rock. His eyes widened.\nIt was heading right fo—\nTHUNK\n—\nCollide activated!\n[Unnamed]\nDealt\n3.3 * 20.3 / 4 = 17 dmg\nto\n[Goblin Skirmisher Grogg]\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 0 m/s\nThe pebble celebrated internally. This place was great! A veritable celebration of blood! A true battlefield!\nThe rock was gaining a new type of wisdom, for it found that it understood battle. More than many military men might themselves, for battlefields were a place of motion, and more specifically, of two vector forces clashing against each other, challenging each other’s strength.\nLike two rocks tumbling down opposing mountains, grimly [Steering] course towards their inevitable clash. Who would break first?\nNot a question the pebble cared for—it only cared that the currents of war were an opportune place to let go and be carried forward.\nAlmost as soon as it landed, a new goblin rushed to pick up the pebble. It had not gone unnoticed on this battlefield. Goblins were a poorer species, not generally able to afford enchanted tools.\nBut this rock… There was something about it. Something\nodd.\nAnd goblins were noticing it. This was not a normal rock, not even just a very gneiss rock, no. This rock was...\nSpecial.\nTwo times it had been thrown, and two lives it had claimed. Already 5 goblins on the field had felt their treasure-sense tingle and were keeping a wary eye out. They were watching the 6th one, who had picked the rock up.\n“Kabab the mighty shall slay every foe!”\nA muscled hulk of a goblin, who began to pitch out, muscles flexing as he readied for a throw.\nHe pitched. Once more, a great increase in movement.\nBut shields were up this time.\nCollide activated!\n[Unnamed]\nDealt 3.3\n*\n25.7 / 4\n= 22 dmg\nto\n[Fortified shield]\nDamage blocked!\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 0 m/s\nAn eager hand reached out from under the shield to grab the rock—but Kabab the mighty was a clever one. It had taken note of the previous thrower’s fate. The mighty goblin chuckled, pointed at the stone with his muscled arm, and activated a skill.\n“[Boomerang throw!]”\nRight as it cluttered against the ground, the pebble once more started accelerating. Back toward the mighty hulk of a goblin.\nSeeing a chance for magnificent gains, the pebble began to [Steer] upwards, at the great goblin’s face. But… a force held it in a tight grip. Unnerringly, the shifts in its [Acceleration] vector were countered by an equal and opposite force—a skill ensuring the stone would return safely.\nTo the throwers hand. A thud, but softer, one readied for. Kabab smiled at the magnificent enchanted weapon in his hand. He began to aim once more, this time muttering a skill.\n“[Shieldpiercer]”.\nOnce more, the pebble was thrown. Faster than it had ever been thrown before. Shields were raised on the other side of the field, readying a hurried defense, but the pebble cared not. It was curious. A [ShieldBreaker] skill? That sounded like something worth investigating.\nSo the pebble steered right at the shields, aiming for the toughest one it saw on the field. Toughness was naturally a result of being made from the toughest and firmest stone, so it chose a greyish shield to go for.\nCollide activated!\n[Unnamed]\nDealt 3.3 * 29.1 / 4\n= 24 dmg\nto\n[Fortified shield]\n[Fortified Shield]\nhas shattered! Damage pierced through!\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 15 m/s\nThe shield shattered into pieces, and the pebble pushed through. No time for a proper [Steer], but it was enough. The shrapnel from the shield shredded a face, sending the shield-holder down, beaten and bloodied.\nAssist Experience granted!\nAnd the pebble kept going, and passed into the backline, hitting an unprepared [Archer] right in the face.\nCollide activated!\n[Unnamed]\nDealt 3\n,3\n* 15 / 4 = 13 dmg\nto\n[Archie the Goblin Archer]\n[Fortified Shield]\nhas shattered! Damage pierced through!\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 0 m/s\nThen the pebble fell to the ground—but no one picked it up this time. Because—as he had thrown the rock—Kabab had charged, leading his melee forces forward. And the lines clashed once more, in a bloody storm of gore and steel.\nThe pebble lay amidst it all, forgotten for his brief role in the fight. But the pebble—it had gained quite a bit from this fight.\nSo it was, that against the backdrop of a war’s finale, the pebble sat back to rest. It began to view the notification it had gotten.\nLevel up!\n40 / 40 xp\nYou have reached level 3!\nStats up!\nMass (m)\n: 3.3kg -> 11.3kg\nDiameter (d)\n: 0.14m -> 0.20m\nHP:\n2 -> 3\nNew Ability Gained!\nEnergy Shift\nChange energy from one form into another.\nA new skill—one more intriguing than any it had gotten before. The rock was not vibrating from excitement—it sat stone-still, but regardless, it held anticipation within it.\nAnd as it had sat there, pondering, the war had ended, one victor surviving.\nKabab stumbled forward, 10 arrows embedded around him, finally finding the stone of his victory. He picked it up, a smile on his face, and the pebble wondered how many years it would have to wait in service to this warrior? Perhaps a chance for levels. The anticipation grew.\nAnd Kabab held the stone up—up at the sky that glittered with a new moon. “The gods have seen fit to bless my victory with divine miracle! Thus begins my new life as [King] Kaba—”\nThonk.\nAn arrow went right through his face, entering by mouth, then exiting out the back. Kabab stumbled down to the ground, dead in an instant.\nAnd the hidden human [Ranger], who had been sneakily pelting arrows throughout the battle finally stepped forward. It was no coincidence that so many goblins had fallen down with arrows in them, evening out the forces until only one goblin had remained.\nThe pebble had not been the only one placing a stone of their own on the scales of war.\nThe [Ranger] walked around the battlefield, face not quite as grim as stone, surveying his work. A grim task. He went through every last goblin, doubling checking they were dead, cutting off ears, then finally returned to the great goblin’s corpse, where he stowed away his bow.\nHe saw a stone. And smiled, his bushy mustache spreading out.\n“Hey—this one is the perfect size! Just like I had been waiting for.”\nAnd once more, the pebble was carried out, to aid a new needy caller in a grand quest, and it felt the anticipation growing.\nIf such a great hunter could get rid of goblins with such contemptible ease... what plans might he have for an \"enchanted\" pebble.\nThe levels and growth… the stone could almost taste them.\nBut it could not. A pebble could not taste.\nSo it once more set itself down into comfortable hands to wait.\nThe patience of stone would always win over all, even if the man would carry it around for a hundred years.\nAnd so, the stone was carried down the mountain, towards a humble hunter’s cabin.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 7 823m\nFull Status:\n[Unnamed]\nTitle(s)\n:\nTitle(s)\n:\nLine-Ender, Patient Ambusher, Bane of Demons\n🗿\nHP\n: 3/3\nMana\n: 0/0\nLevel\n: 3\nExperience\n: 0/70\nClass\n: Rolling Stone\nSub-class\n: None\nRace\n: Gneiss Stone\nGold\n: 0\nSTATS\nDiameter (d)\n: 0.20m\nMass (m)\n: 11.3kg\nABILITIES\nCollide\nSteer\nEnergy Shift",

      "content": "The rock—it was a tiny pebble no longer—was not being thrown at enemies. Neither was it being dropped on enemies. Or even rolled…\nWasn’t that the whole point of being a [Rolling Stone]?\nNo, instead the rock was sweating. Well, not actually sweating, but it was growing hot, then being cooled by a spray of water in periodic intervals. That was close enough, right?\nYes—it had gotten stuck again.\nThe stone had been ready to lay down its arms and retire once more from a great career of adventure—even if its quest was yet to be completed. But... there was just one issue.\nThis was no comforting rest. The rock was being tortured.\nIt lay in a heap of its kin, the largest rock of all, centerpiece of the display. Above a stove constantly stoked with fresh firewood, which kept the rocks heating up.\nUntil a spray of water cooled them again.\nThe rock cursed the inventor of this infernal torture device, which some may have recognized to be a sauna. The [Ranger] had stripped down from his gear, and now stood there, skin white and furless, exposing himself indecently before the rock.\nOf course, it didn’t care about\nthat\n, per se.\nIf anything, the dangling bits shifting about before it were a fresh point of interest, something for the stone to discreetly observe. Some twisted kin of its? For two small pebbles sat hanging down behind the trunk. Were they trapped too, in torture as hellish as the rock's?\nIt swore to free them, for this stone was a true hero. And so… the rock began to plot. How could it escape this fiendish situation, and exact vengeance on its captor?\nIt began experimenting.\nThe [Velocity] vector was a flat zero, and the stone was wedged tightly between its kin, so escaping through [Steer] seemed doomed to fail. One plan out.\nThe only plan, if it had still been the humble pebble of before, capable of only slightly changing course. But it was a grown stone now, level 3. A mighty warrior, truly.\nWith a new skill.\nNew Ability Gained!\nEnergy Shift\nChange energy from one form into another.\nNow, what exactly did this mean? It was a curious skill, with many new variables unfamiliar to the rock. But… it smelled of potential. Or would have, if the rock could have smelled.\nWith the methodical mind of a boulder, it began to experiment. Because… the stone was being heated up. And cooled. And whenever that shift happened, it had a faint sense of it.\nA shift in energy.\nEnergy of an unfamiliar sort—so far it only understood the relation of mass and velocity. Kinetic energy, the one most easy for a rock to grasp. For these were cyclic mountains, where the changes of heat happened slowly.\nThe weather did not shift in a matter of days, it took seasons for temperatures to truly move around. So the rock had never before noticed the true difference between hot and cold, before being trapped inside this chamber of horrors.\nIt tapped at that energy with a sense and shifted a\nsmall,\ntiny portion into its new skill.\nThen it used [Shift Energy].\nEnergy Shift activated!\nConverting [Thermal Energy] to [Kinetic Energy]\nΔ0.001k ->\n1.4 m/s\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n:\n1.4\nm/s\nThe rock shifted in place, just a hint, and then settled back.\nThe [Ranger] looked up, then dismissed the change as a quirk—a cracking of rocks at the heat of a stove. He felt slight regret that he may have to find some new proper stones in the future.\nBut meanwhile… a rock was waiting. Because that had been... absurdly powerful. Just one small, absolutely minuscule drop in temperature, and it had managed to increase it's velocity by such an amount...\nClearly, this was perfectly balanced.\nSo, the rock waited a few more moments, warming up. More energy was obviously better, and it finally had a reliable storage of sorts.\nSo it waited, measuring the increase in energy throughout its body, feeling a growing anticipation. The [Ranger] was strong, a merciless killer who had taken down a horde of goblins on his own. But the stone had methods of its own too.\nThe man reached for the ladle held within a bucket, then took it out, a measure of water within. He readied for a throw.\nThe stone used [Energy Shift], measuring an amount of energy it considered appropriate, thrusting it down like the tiniest dip into ice.\nEnergy Shift activated!\nConverting [Thermal Energy] to [Kinetic Energy]\nΔ1k -> 44.7 m/s\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 44.7m/s\nIt blasted out of the stove, scattering other hot stones around the room, aiming right at its trapped brethren.

WEAK SPOT TARGETED!\nDAMAGE DOUBLED!\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 0m/s\nThe man crumpled down with a whimper, his nether regions reduced to nothing, and the rock realized it had crushed the captive pebbles too. A kinslayer! But no title came of it, so the rock figured it was alright.\nThen the experience came. Or tried to—but the rock held off, just for a moment.\nIt wanted to enjoy the outdoors.\nSo, it heaped over a generous helping of temperature for the skill, deciding to test out how fast it could\nreally\ngo. Because it really was quite hot, a bit too hot even.\nEnergy Shift activated!\nConverting [Thermal Energy] to [Kinetic Energy]\nΔ500k -> 1000 m/s\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 1000 m/s\nAND THE ROCK STARTED MOVING VERY VERY VERY FAST INDEED AND—\nIt stopped suddenly, before it even moved one meter, held in place by an ever-present force, which finally detected that something was very very wrong indeed here.\nERROR_ABILITY_ABUSE_DETECTED: SAFEGUARDS ACTIVATED\nSkill: [Energy Shift] has gone over safety limit for\nSearching for solution...\nA cooling presence enveloped the rock.\nThe rock sat still, waiting in place patiently for the system to resolve the problem. It just sat there... waiting.\nAnd the grew nervous. Because it had already searched for three days, but the rock didn't tire of watching it. Usually, people gave up after a few minutes, letting it sneakily adjust things behind their backs.\nBut this rock...\nwatched\n.\nAnd the panicked, quickly adjusting matters in the fastest way it could.\nERROR: SOLUTION FOUND\nAdjusting for entity ...\nComplete!\nApplying limitations...\nComplete!\nObfuscating logic...\nComplete!\nThe rock felt some immaterial force around it change and shift about, like getting into new clothes for the first time.\nPatch Applied!\nPlease continue on with your\nCurious, the rock decided to test out its newly modified skill. How would it work now? It still had [Energy Shift], it could feel it. Carefully, it reached out for the skill.\nEnergy Shift activated!\nConverting [Thermal Energy] to [Kinetic Energy]!\nUsing Maximum allowed ΔT! (Dependant on level)\nUser is not allowed to use ΔT for below 273.15K\nΔ1K = Δ1 m/s\nNew velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n:\n20 m/s\nThe rock jaunted forward a hint, accelerating. But this new solution... it almost felt lazy. A lot less broken in some ways. But it might just work well enough for what it had in mind...\nSo it didn't bother calling for customer support. Nobody would have answered, probably.\nThe rock waited patiently in place, as the heat in the room gradually warmed it back up—not as hot as it had been before, just a fraction. But enough.\nEnergy Shift activated!\nConverting [Thermal Energy] to [Kinetic Energy]\nΔ2K = Δ2 m/s\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 2 m/s\nIt launched itself towards the exposed fireplace, and fell within the burning embers. Heat enveloped it, but this time—the rock welcomed it all, for heat was energy. It waited, heating up more and more, gaining a higher level of energy than it had ever felt within itself before.\nSo it waited, heating up until it glowed orange, then, finally satisfied with its bounty, it released it a proper, more restrained amount. It aimed up, at the room’s one tiny window—just wide enough to fit it through.\nEnergy Shift activated!\nConverting [Thermal Energy] to [Kinetic Energy]\nΔ12K = Δ12 m/s\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 12 m/s\nIt flew through the sauna, then smashed into the window, easily blasting it apart.\nAnd once more, got to the great outdoors, and started rolling down the mountain.\nLevel up!\n100 / 70 xp\nDiscarding overflow xp\nYou have reached level 4!\nStats up!\nMass (m)\n: 11.3kg -> 38.2kg\nDiameter (d)\n: 0.20m -> 0.30m\nHP:\n3 -> 5\nAnd it grew once more, swelling in size and mass more than it ever had before, and once more rolled through the great outdoors.\nBut things were different.\nAs its pace accelerated, greater and greater, the rock felt the cooler air around it, already making its gathered heat fade, and it made a realization. If it could shift energy from heat to motion...\nCould it not also do it the other way around?\nCurious, the rock took a look at its current velocity, as it bounded down the mountain at a growing speed.\nCurrent Velocity (V)\n: 22.7m/s\nWhat if it just... changed all of it to heat.\nEnergy Shift activated!\nConverting [Kinetic Energy] to [Thermal Energy]!\nΔ12 m/s = Δ12 K\nNew Temperature for\n[Unnamed]\n: 816.7K\nThe rock’s pace halted to a stop, the skill acting as a brake, naturally heating it up in the process. Then it began accelerating downwards again, inevitably dragged down by gravity. But the rock was elated.\nIt now had a steer, and a brake. Energy was the key.\nThe rock saw it had everything it really needed to navigate now, but it had also learned the heights of Mt. Tai. In these mountains, there were great enemies. Ones that could slaughter goblin hordes with ease. It would not always have the opportunity of ambush. If it wanted to make its way down safely…\nIt needed more power.\nAnd as it had learned… levels were power. And the rock could level by hitting things in the head really hard. Or the balls lower down from the head—whichever was easier really.\nAs it plotted and planned it spotted a flash of green ducking to cover. Not grass, not this high up. A goblin—perhaps several.\nThe rock remembered how the last time it met goblins it had been just a projectile, an unwilling participant in a war. No more. It [Steered].\nIt was time for a warpath of its own choosing.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 6 511m\nFull Status:\n[Unnamed]\nTitle(s)\n:\nLine-Ender, Patient Ambusher, Bane of Demons\n🗿\nHP\n: 5/5\nMana\n: 0/0\nLevel\n: 4\nExperience\n: 0/100\nClass\n: Rolling Stone\nSub-class\n: None\nRace\n: Gneiss Stone\nGold\n: 0\nSTATS\nDiameter (d)\n: 0.30m\nMass (m)\n: 38.2kg\nABILITIES\nCollide\nSteer\nEnergy Shift",

      "content": "This was no silent ambush. The rock rushed down the mountain, almost 40 kilograms at an ever faster pace, right at a goblin. A goblin who saw the rock, ducked down behind a ledge to cover and thought he was safe.\nWrong.\nThe rock almost flew right over the goblin’s head, that was how fast it was moving. But then, right after it jumped the cliff and hovered over the goblin…\nIt braked, midair.\nMovement turned to heat, but only horizontal movement. The rock kept all the rest of the movement, and shifted direction straight downwards, only heating up a tiny bit.\nThe goblin only saw the approaching shadow.\nSplat.\nCollide activated!\n[Unnamed]\nDealt 20.3\n*\n38.2 / 4\n= 193 dmg\nto\n[Goblin Buddy Bubba]\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 2m/s\nAnd the rock continued forward, rolling over the fresh goblin corpse. Once more accelerating. It made a realization.\nIf it continually braked, then continued rolling, then braked again, it would gradually heat up. And energy would be stored.\nEnergy which could be converted back to motion, if used fast enough. The skill had a cooldown, and the heat did tend to dissipate, especially if there was a lot of it.\nThe rock slowed its pace significantly and started heating up. But still kept creeping forward, ever on the prowl for more prey.\nIt saw a scouting party of 5 goblins marching up the mountain, and finally stopped completely, turning all remaining movement into heat. It heated up, still only a hundred-or-so degrees above 0C.\nAnd the scouting party, they just saw a curiously hot-seeming rock, just standing still right there, on the mountainside.\nThey had seen it stop.\nAnd, well… A rock standing still on the mountainside was an amusing thing for a goblin. They could kick it down, and watch how it bounced down, hopefully crushing some unlucky human’s skull. They walked closer. The rock took aim.\nAnd released.\nEnergy Shift activated!\nConverting [Thermal Energy] to [Kinetic Energy]!\nUsing Maximum allowed ΔT!

They just stared, stared at the rock that was again just standing still right there.\nIt had not used all its heat. Not nearly. It was waiting for the cooldown to tick... slowly...\nNow!\nAgain it pounced forward, a viper in rock-form and crushed a head, but this time, the 3 remaining goblins ran, scattering in every direction. The rock chased.\nThe first goblin ran to the right and the rock chased, bounding down the rocky mountainside’s craggy edge. In his terror, the goblin tripped on small rock and fell down. The larger rock saluted its comrade for the assist, then moved on for the finisher.\nThe other two goblins—one of them was headed\nup.\nThat really made the rock pause, it had only ever really gone down. Could it even go up on its own?\nHalf-heartedly, it used some energy to launch itself up the slope. The maximum its level allowed.\nIt went up a good distance, but not\nnearly\nenough to reach the goblin, then started tumbling back down. It fell below its launch point before the cooldown on the skill came back. And the rock made a realization: There were limitations in this method: energy was being lost constantly. It could only adjust\nhow\nit floated along the stream of gravity, not truly swim against it.\nReluctantly, it let the smarter goblin escape, and turned its attention back down. Down, down down, it was always down, wasn’t it?\nCould it ever go up?\nOnce it reached the bottom of the mountain, the end of gravity’s tide—what could it even do then? Be trapped down there forever?\nAs it was now—it would never be able to reach the mountaintop again. Was that a worthy fate for it? No.\nBut still—there were few options currently. It saw the goblin running downward in a mad panic, and almost\nsighing,\nwent on the obligatory chase. But its heart was no longer in it—it didn’t hurry.\nWhy should it hurry on its quest down the mountain, when that quest might just signal its final doom?\nAnd so, the rock made a halfhearted effort at the chase. If the goblin started slowing, the rock would let itself quicken the pace a bit, and then it would again loiter about, circle around a bit, search for anything interesting.\nSearching for an answer. Energy—the key was energy. Right now, its only source of new energy was gravity itself, a rather harsh and unbending mistress, one that would only let it go down. But it remembered the coals, the fire, the\nheat.\nCould it light such a boiling heat inside itself too? And where did all these queer creatures find the energy to tumble against gravity, madly dashing up the mountain?\nThe rock almost started respecting the goblins, who so bravely spat in the face of gravity, and braved its highest reaches. Where was that little goblin going anyway?\nThe rock made a realization—the goblin was not running in a mad panic anymore.\nIt knew where it was going.\nWould it lead to a place with… more goblins?\nIt grew excited. Who knew that prolonging the chase out of existential despair could have such benefits? Where was the goblin going? What would the rock find?\nAll philosophical troubles faded from the rock’s mind, as that first spark of adventure was lit anew. Like a tiny pebble discovering the world again, it shone with heat from excessive braking and headed down.\nAnd finally… the goblin reached its destination. A hole opening\ndown,\ninside the mountain. Not natural stone—something built up carefully. It crept close, and felt a shift in the air. Something different, something new.\nSomething it recognized with its new senses.\nEnergy.\nIt could sense these things now, so it could feel\nsomething.\nSomething absolutely brimming with energy, which leaked out and emanated in the air all around. Coming from… down that little hole? What was making all that energy?\nFor a moment, it peered away from the hole, looking at the endless slope without eyes. It could continue downwards… and pursue its main quest. Even a futile one. Or…\nIt could take on a side quest.\nAnd so, the rock made its decision. How long would a sidequest take, anyways? It would not get distracted.\nDown, deeper in the hole, at the bottom of the pit, a goblin was breathing a sigh of relief, finally having shaken off the terrifying rock. He had not spotted it for five minutes, but still he felt jitters.\nSuddenly—he sensed a shadow from up above and—\nSplat.\nCollide activated!\n[Unnamed]\nDealt 25.2\n*\n38.2 / 4\n= 241 dmg\nto\n[Goblin Dungeon Mobster Mab]\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 0m/s\nLevel up!\n113 / 100 xp\nDiscarding overflow xp\nYou have reached level 5!\nStats up!\nMass (m)\n: 38.2kg -> 128.8kg\nDiameter (d)\n: 0.30m -> 0.46m\nHP: 5 -> 8\nNew Ability Gained!\nPivot Point\nSet a pivot point within 2m (adjusts with size) and pivot around it, conserving energy in the movement.\nAnd so.. the rock dropped down into the dungeon.

      "content": "The rock which was starting to slowly become a boulder landed into the dungeon with a splat, a dead goblin below it. And it had gotten a new level, and a new skill.\nVery handy things for leveling, these green thingies, the rock thought. Wasn’t there that saying… killing how-many goblins with one stone?\nIt was probably a good count by now.\nBut the dungeon had an invader now. And the dungeon reacted.\nThe rock perceived footsteps approaching, feet like stone hitting the brick floor. Or to be more precise, feet of\nbone.\nA mass of skeletons, coming up a long-downward sloping corridor as one big horde. The rock saw them and… didn’t feel much fear. It was a rock after all.\nBut it did feel hot. It had braked once during the fall down here, and converted a nice bit of thermal energy for itself in the process.\nRemaining stored Temperature: 150K\nEnough energy to conquer a dungeon? Perhaps. But the rock had noticed another curious thing. The corridor that army of skeletons were shambling up on…\nIt was a downward sloping corridor.\nEnergy Shift activated!\nConverting [Thermal Energy] to [Kinetic Energy]!\nΔ5K = Δ5 m/s\nNew velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 5\nm/s\nRemaining stored Temperature: 145K\nThe rock prodded itself forward gently, onto to slope, and began doing its job. Being a [Rolling Stone]. The floor was smooth, decently steep, and very easy to roll in. Much more pleasant than the rough mountainside. And in front of the rock…\nThe skeletons had stopped, hesitating in the face of the approaching projectile. The rock though saw only experience to be harvested, and rolled forth to the grindstone. The skeletons turned around, shuffling back towards whence they came, but they couldn't\naccelerate\nlike a rolling stone.\nIt got near the skeletons, then used just a hint of its new skill, attaching an ethereal thread of sorts to the ceiling. And it swung up.\nPivot Point activated!\nDirection: Up\nRotation: 112\n°\nThe rock flew up, carefully using [Steer], and smashed into the first skeleton’s ribs, which were ground down to bits. It barely slowed down, only changing velocity by 5m/s as it bowled through.\nCollide activated!\n[Unnamed]\nDealt 5\n*\n128.8 / 4\n= 161 dmg\nto\n[Generic Skeleton Todd]\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 14m/s\nIt continued forward, hitting the next skeleton in the hips as its speed barely slowed against the rather light boned warriors.\nCollide activated!\n[Unnamed]\nDealt 4\n*\n128.8 / 4\n= 129 dmg\nto\n[Generic Skeleton Tadd]\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 7 m/s\nThen it started to slow, getting too close to the ground, and skeletons were on all sides. Time for a shift. It used a hint of energy, aiming the new velocity towards the right.\nEnergy Shift activated!\nConverting [Thermal Energy] to [Kinetic Energy]!\nΔ10K = Δ10 m/s\nNew velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 15\nm/s\nRemaining stored Temperature: 125K\nIt veered to the right, a [Steer] and the new burst of energy driving it, and two more skeletons were grouped together and smashed against a wall.\nCollide activated!\n[Unnamed]\nDealt 6\n*\n128.8 / 4\n= 193 dmg\nto\n[Generic Skeleton Couple Tudd & Tidd]\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 8.3 m/s\nThen the rock finally paused for a moment, surveying the results. Four destroyed skeletons in a matter of moments, with the rest fleeing down the slope as fast as they could. The rock braked in place, gathered a hint of heat, and did not hurry to the chase.\nBecause it had noticed something.\nThe slope was rather wide at the top, allowing the skeletons to gather side-by-side. But ahead… there was a doorway and a\nnarrow\ncorridor. Just narrow enough for skeletons to move in single-file.\nIf it knew of such things, the rock would have received enlightenment on the joys of bowling.\nSo it waited, slowly rolling forward, gradually letting its pace increase. It waited as the skeletons clanked forward in a mad dash. And then—when the last skeleton had entered the narrow bit—the stone started rolling.\nAnd accelerating.\nAnd braking, and heating up.\nAnd accelerating more.\nCurrent Velocity: 25 m/s\nIt rolled forward, with the inevitability of stone, ready to grind all foes to dust. And got to the hallway. The skeletons were right ahead, shambling in a mad panic, moving faster as they heard the approaching rumble.\nThe rock lined up a shot, then attached a pivot point up to the ceiling, for just the briefest moment.\nIt flew up into the air just a bit, to about the skeleton’s hip height. Like a golfer lining the perfect shot, the driver finally hit home.\nEnergy Shift activated!\nConverting [Thermal Energy] to [Kinetic Energy]!\nΔ25K = Δ25 m/s\nNew velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 50\nm/s\nRemaining stored Temperature: 90 K\nIt blasted forward, with just a slight upward angle, using the maximum amount of heat it could at its current level. A giant cannonball that needed no gunpowder, just movement of its own.\nAnd it crashed into the first skeleton. And the next. And the next. And them all.\nCollide activated!\n[Unnamed]\nDealt 8.9\n*\n128.8 / 4\n= 286 dmg\nto\n[Generic Skeleton Mob] * 3\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 39.2 m/s\nIt blasted forward, crumpled bones falling behind it into piles as the magic holding them together broke in the face of stone. Its speed barely slowed, as each impact was like braking through another thin wall of barrier magic.\nCollide activated!\n[Unnamed]\nDealt 10.1\n*\n128.8 / 4\n= 286 dmg\nto\n[Generic Skeleton Mob] * 4\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 26.7 m/s\nIt was starting to fall nearer to the ground, so the stone made just the\nslightest\npivot up, getting up into the next skeletons ribs.\nPivot Point activated!\nDirection: Up\nRotation: 15\n°\nBone was smashed, and the last skeleton fell onto the ground in a motionless heap. No more skeletons ahead—just stairs. The rock fell down, bumped on a stair, bumped on the next, then realized it did not really like stairs.\nBecause... for the first time ever...\nIt took damage.\nCollision Damage received!\nHP 8/8 -> 5/8\nThe rock decided that it\nreally\ndid not like stairs. Rocks weren't supposed to take damage! They were supposed to just blast right through!\nSlopes had been invented for a reason!\nSo it steered, braked and pivoted up, keeping itself airborne, just a hint away from bumping against all the stairs.\nIt neared the ceiling, but suddenly a panel in the roof opened, and wooden spikes were pushed out, right at the flying stone.\nThey broke against it, but still managed to smack it down—hard. The stone smacked into the stairs once more.\nCollision Damage received!\nHP 5/8 -> 3/8\nThis was not right at all! A dungeon could deal damage to a rock? Now that was just unfair. The stone started to get annoyed. It got to the bottom of the stairs, keeping up a good pace.\nAnd then a\npit trap\nopened under.\nIt threw a [Pivot Point] to the ceiling, then gracefully hopped over the 4-meter long pit. It landed on the other side, then kept going forward, rapidly getting deeper and deeper into the dungeon.\nSuddenly, vents opened up all over the corridor, and a hissing sound started as gas began flooding the tunnel. The stone just got confused at the poison gas trap, and did not slow for it.\nMaybe the dungeon had stopped being able to damage it? As long as there were no more stairs... What was that green mist thing anyway? It had never seen the like of it.\nIt remembered seeing clouds and mist before, but they really didn’t belong underground, did they? Something was wrong.\nThen there was a spark, and the hallway blasted up in flame.\nThe rock braked, and sat down in place, marveling at the burning-gas traps. Was this a place where it could collect energy for free?\nThe flames faded after a moment, engulfing the stone for but an instant, but still blackening its surface. The hissing started again, and soon there was more fire. And the rock let itself heat up.\nBut it wasn’t that effective, the flames were so brief, it was barely staying positive in the energy department for the time it had to wait around.\nIt decided to move on. Another energy shift, and back forward, at a nice and calm 15m/s.\nIt got further in, having to pivot around a corner, then abrubly stopped as it came stone-to-stone with a wall blocking it. Vents opened above. A familiar hissing sound.\nThen two flamethrowers opened fire on the rock.\nThe stone decided to sit back for a moment—satisfied. Finally it was getting proper treatment. These fires didn’t stop, so it got to patiently sit around and wait for its energy level to increase.\nRemaining stored Temperature: 200K\nALERT: MAXIMUM ALLOWED TEMPERATURE REACHED! APPLYING PUNITIVE MEASURES!\nPunitive Damage received!\nHP 3/8 -> 2/8\nWhat was this? Was the\nangry\nat the rock for how it was behaving?\nPunitive measures.\nThe rock gave the air around it a mean glare, or you could at least imagine it doing so, then it began to move on. But... there was a wall in front… Perhaps it should just go through? It converted 10K into energy for itself, and launched at the wall.\nIt blasted through the magical illusion, reaching the other side. A hulking monstrosity of flesh stood up in a vast room, looming over the stone. A goblin dressed in dark robes sat atop its head, barking commands, but it paused when it saw the invader.\nThe rock paused too.\nThe goblin [Necromancer] narrowed his eyes. Had somebody just thrown a rock inside his lair, through all that? Who would carry a rock so deep into a dungeon? Where was the invader it had been warned about?\nIt instructed the flesh golem to walk in closer, to examine things. The lumbering giant took two steps forward.\nThen the goblin realized the stone was\nhot.\nA bit under 200 degrees warmer than it should have been.\nIt realized something was wrong.\nToo late, it was close already. The rock pounced, using up as much energy as it was allowed.\nCollide activated!\n[Unnamed]\nDealt 9.5\n*\n128.8 / 4\n= 305 dmg\nto\n[Flesh Monstrosity of Dra'ith]\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 14.5 m/s\nIt blasted right through the flesh golem, which was far too soft to provide any issue for the red-hot stone, destroying it in an instant. Then it attached a pivot point to one of the room's support pillars, one just a bit to the right and started rotating.\nAll the way.\nPivot Point activated!\nDirection: Right\nRotation: 360\n°\nIt circled the full loop back as the golem fell down, slowly crumpling, with a panicking goblin on its back. The golem fell down just a\nperfect\namount, bringing the goblin to the perfect spot.\nThe rock slammed right into the goblin, sending itself and it flying into the outer wall.\nCollide activated!\n[Unnamed]\nDealt 6.2\n*\n128.8 / 4\n= 200 dmg\nto\n[Great Necromancer Grogg]\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 5.5 m/s\nThe goblin was squished in between a rock and a hard place, and the golem dissolved completely.\nLevel up!\n259 / 150 xp\nDiscarding overflow xp\nYou have reached level 6!\nStats up!\nMass (m)\n: 128.8kg -> 434.6kg\nDiameter (d)\n: 0.46m -> 0.68m\nHP: 8 -> 13\nAnd the rock fell down, still holding quite a bit of heat inside it—ready to continue challenging the dungeon. The levelup made it grow a lot more than before, which satisfied it immensely.\nThese things were just so handy! It had only rolled forward a small bit, and already it had been provided with energy charging and experience, free of charge.\nIt rather liked these dungeon things.\nA door opened on the other side, and the [Rolling Stone] kept moving forward without hesitating more.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 5 257m\nFull Status:\n[Unnamed]\nTitle(s)\n:\nLine-Ender, Patient Ambusher, Bane of Demons\n🗿\nHP\n: 7/13\nMana\n: 0/0\nLevel\n: 6\nExperience\n: 0/250\nClass\n: Rolling Stone\nSub-class\n: None\nRace\n: Gneiss Stone\nGold\n: 0\nSTATS\nDiameter (d)\n: 0.68m\nMass (m)\n: 434.6kg\nABILITIES\nCollide\nSteer\nEnergy Shift\nPivot Point",

      "content": "Deep down, inside a mountain, a [Dungeon Core] was panicking. A [Bone Core] to be precise. For some reason, the intruder to his [Bone Zone]…\nWas just not stopping.\n“Why? Why does he not stop? What manner of invader is this?”\nA gleaming blue gem floated in the dungeon’s deepest room, with only his goblin [Necromancer] lieutenants as listeners.\nHe could sense the intruder delving ever deeper, at accelerating speed—\nAnd nothing was stopping him.\n“I’ve tried the flamethrowers, but he just stood in them! Same with the poison gas! Throgg and his flesh horror were defeated in a matter of seconds! The welcoming skeletons even faster!”\nIf he had had fingers, he would have bit them bloody. But alas, all the core could do was shift color, red to blue to red, and vibrate.\nAnd shout.\n“Go! The rest of you, go! Prepare the bone abomination! And the mega-death pit! Get ready to activate it! He’s almost there! How is he so fast? Go! Move!”\nHis goblins finally sprang to motion, running to manipulate the complex lever and pulley system which controlled the dungeon’s many traps. The core spun in place, glaring at each subordinate in turn, panic growing as he felt the intruder getting nearer and nearer.\nBut most of all—the status just did not make sense.\n// DUNGEON INVASION IN PROGRESS:\n// INVADERS: 1\n// INVADER AVERAGE LEVEL: 6\nIt was just one level 6 invader.\nHe himself was a level 19 [Bone Core], and the flesh horror had been at least 15. “What kind of ridiculously broken class can this be? A [Hero]? Please tell me it’s not a [Hero].”\n“S-sir,” one of the goblins hesitantly said, lifting up a hand.\nThe core spun, aiming a bright red light at his face. “What is it?”\nThe goblin gulped. “The [Hero] left this realm 6 months ago—there shouldn’t be another one.”\nThe core focused the bright light into a burning red lazer, and scorched a hole through the goblin’s head. It fell down to the ground, dead.\n“You fool, do you not think I know that already?”\nThe core almost began another rant then and there, but then he stopped—the intruder was right on the spot. He spun, red light rapidly blinking. “Now! Activate the mega-death-pit-of-doom now! He’s right there!”\nA goblin pulled a lever, and the core felt a shift in the dungeon as a corridors floor fell down, revealing a 40-meter drop, straight into the mega-bone-golem’s lair.\nHe sensed the intruder drop down, and finally felt some relief.\nAt least with this—\nThen the intruder suddenly paused in place, midair, 30 meters above the bottom, movement slowing down considerably.\nThe core shrieked. “Levitation magic too?”\nNo. The intruder had started falling again.\n“What is going on—at that speed—surely they will—”\nThe intruder approached the ground like a stone, and the core held the light in place, red with no blinks, awaiting the impact.\nThe bone horror is right next, ready, this can’t go—\nThen the intruder suddenly shifted, all speed transferring from vertical to horizontal in one smooth rotation, and blasted right into the bone horror, smashing it into pieces in an instant.\n“N-no… What? What was that? A [Double Jump], into a forward slash? No—it’s all wrong—”\nHe paused. The enemy was still moving—right here. There was only a short corridor between the pit’s bottom and this room.\nHe looked over his shaking minions, thoughts dark.\nSo it’s come to this…\nThe core took hold of the various lifestrands emanating from it, then ripped them all apart. The goblins vanished with terrified screams, dissolving into pits of blood. Light rapidly blinking, the core shoved all the remaining life energy into the ground, in a true last ditch effort.\nTo summon a defender.\n“Arise! Greater Rock Golem!”\nA lumbering, circular figure of stone rose up from the floor like a giant tortoise, then legs spouted out from it, and it shakily got up. It loomed into place, a veritable mountain ripping itself free from the ground.\n“Go! Kill the intruder now!”\nThe golem took a step forward, but at that same moment, the vault doors blasted open as the intruder entered.\nThe core’s flashing light stopped on the figure that had arrived into the middle of the room, stopping in place there.\nA… stone?\n“Go! Kill it!” he said, using all his authority to force the golem on the move as fast as possible.\nBut the golem… It stepped forward and made a gesture to the stone.\nThe core started losing his mind. “What are you… Don’t try to duel it!”\n—\nA duel.\nThe rock sensed the golem’s intentions right away, a bond of kinship between those of common birth. The beings of stone.\nAn honorable duel with all the hard feelings.\nBecause was not honor a rock-solid feeling?\nThe rock was making many new realizations about the world. But it accepted the duel, shuffling forward and dipping forward in a small courtesy bow.\nA queer blinking thing was flashing furiously in the background, but the rock did not care for it. This was a duel of stone.\nAnd for a duel of stone… there was only one contest that mattered.\nEnergy Shift activated!\nConverting [Thermal Energy] to [Kinetic Energy]!\nΔ20K = Δ20 m/s\nNew velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 20\nm/s\nRemaining stored Temperature: 60 K\nThey both launched at each other, fast as they could.\nCollide activated!\n[Unnamed]\nDealt 14.3\n*\n434.6 / 4\n= 1554 dmg\nto\n[Greater Earth Golem]\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 3 m/s\nCollision Damage received!\nHP 7/13 -> 5/13\nThe earth golem... Was not destroyed. The stone watched in disbelief as only the segment it had flown through sloughed off, the rest of the golem moving in to fill the blank spot. This enemy did not operate on the same principles as all the previous ones. It was...\nA true foe.\nBoth duelists back from the first joust, feeling at new injuries that would become scars of honour. A large crack now went through the rock, and the golem had lost a lot of mass, a great mass slowly dripping off it.\nThat was the difference between them.\nThe rock would either be whole or destroyed completely. Its nature did not allow for losing a bit of mass. The golem meanwhile did not gather any cracks, but lost bits and pieces as a tradeoff.\nA solid core, versus a moving landslide.\nWhich would win?\nThey both ignored the light that was blinking annoyingly in the background. It did not matter. This was a matter between a brotherhood of stone—no gem of carbon could interfere.\nTime for the second joust—the contestants launched each other again.\nEnergy Shift activated!\nConverting [Thermal Energy] to [Kinetic Energy]!\nΔ30K = Δ30 m/s\nNew velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 30\nm/s\nRemaining stored Temperature: 30 K\nFaster than the first time, that had been just a test. The true duel started now.\nCollide activated!\n[Unnamed]\nDealt 25.1\n*\n434.6 / 4\n= 2727 dmg\nto\n[Greater Earth Golem]\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 3 m/s\nCollision Damage received!\nHP 5/13 -> 3/13\nGrievous wounds—the rock felt a crack almost connect through it, splitting it in two. But it held on.\nIt did not lose mass. The golem… it was worse for wear. Devastated. Half its mass gone, but still—it rose up resolutely, determination solidifying its outer shell.\nWith a small exertion of energy, the rock gave a salute of honor. It was the finest battle it had ever been in.\nThe two prepared for the third and final joust, when suddenly—\nThe annoying flashing light thing flared out, finally done with just waiting around, and a melting-hot beam emanated from its center, straight at the rock. It was not ready to dodge, and low on health, could it—\nSuddenly the golem moved, with the strength of a landslide, blocking off the beam with its own body.\nThe rock stared—stunned like a statue, or a rock—at the heroic sacrifice. A true warrior, who would not hesitate to put death before dishonor.\nThe flashing thing screeched in rage as the golem fell, dissolving into muck and rocks onto the ground.\nA flaming fire lit within the rock’s soul. It aimed at the hateful interrupter of a sacred battle, releasing all the energy within its body.\nAn absolute killing blow, with no mercy to it. It flew at the dungeon core and—\nIt did not stand a chance.\nThe damage was irrelevant, as soon as it met the relentless forces of physics, the core cracked, and fell apart, shattering into shards of glittering light. A new notification came.\nDungeon: The Bone Zone Cleared!\nCongratulations!\nBonus Experience awarded!\nLevel up!\n400 / 250 xp\nDiscarding overflow xp\nYou have reached level 7!\nStats up!\nMass (m)\n: 343.6kg -> 1466.7kg\nDiameter (d)\n: 0.68m -> 1.03m\nHP: 13 -> 21\nNew Ability Gained!\nLike a Rock\nActivate to disguise yourself, making others think you are just a rock.\nThe rock saluted its fallen adversary, and celebrated its new level. Life and death, both at once.\nA beautiful thing.\nIt appreciated the poetry in the moment for a single moment, then turned to leave.\nThen looked up.\nAt the many-many stairs that stood between it and the corridor up above. The room was sealed otherwise, a simple box with levels and ropes all along the walls. But the rock…\n—Suddenly realized how cold it was.\nRemaining stored Temperature: 0 K\nCurrent Velocity: 0 m/s\nIt had no energy, nothing to move with.\nNot even to roll around the room for a bit, to explore, to attempt something with the ropes.\nThere was no mountain to roll down. There was no slope. No domain of gravity.\nJust a flat plane.\nStuck.\nAnd so—the rock reflected on the honorable duel it had ended its adventuring career on…\nAnd felt satisfied.\nMaybe this was not so bad. It would remain here, honoring the fallen golem.\nA fine end.\n—\nOr was it?\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 5 192m\nFull Status:\n[Unnamed]\nTitle(s)\n:\nLine-Ender, Patient Ambusher, Bane of Demons\n🗿\nHP\n: 11/21\nMana\n: 0/0\nLevel\n: 7\nExperience\n: 0/500\nClass\n: Rolling Stone\nSub-class\n: None\nRace\n: Gneiss Stone\nGold\n: 0\nSTATS\nDiameter (d)\n: 1.03m\nMass (m)\n: 1466.7kg\nABILITIES\nCollide\nSteer\nEnergy Shift\nPivot Point\nLike a Rock",

      "content": "Fine,\nfine,\nFINE\n.\nLet’s admit it, that was a bit of an exaggeration. Yes, it was 500 years of mostly sitting still, but that did not necessarily mean that absolutely nothing happened. To an outside observer, of course it would look like the stone was doing absolutely nothing, just sitting still in a closed off room, tranquil and at peace.\nBut… to something that listened, such activities had another title. And as the rock sat there, patiently waiting, doing absolutely nothing, something became eligible to it.\nYou are eligible for the sub-class:\nCultivator\nAccept the class? Y/N\nThe rock jolted awake, though it had never really been sleeping in the first place. It had just been letting time pass, in the way rocks tended to. Unmoving in the stream of time. And perhaps that was the key—the ingredient that made it suitable for this new option.\nAnd the rock—it did not hesitate. After all, cultivation sounded like a fine thing to do. Its main goal in the world was cultivating mass, so surely this new sub-class would help it in its goals? Perhaps… it might even escape this room?\nNothing more to it, the rock enthusiastically accepted the prompt.\nCongratulations!\nYou are now a level 1\nCultivator\n!\nYou are now in the [Energy Gathering] realm.\nNew Ability Gained!\nMeditate\nSlowly gather latent energies around you, growing out your Qi Vessels.\nCultivator stats unlocked!\nEnergy Level (E) =\n1W\nQi to Next Realm =\n0/10\nA new ability? And new… energy?\nCuriously the rock used some of its new energy with Energy shift, turning it into kinetic energy. It wobbled just a hint in place.\nAlas, a level 1 cultivator was not yet mighty enough to shift the heavens. But… a rock was patient. And it found that by focusing on its new skill… time seemed to pass even faster. So, the rock leaned back comfortably into its resting place, focused on the ambient sounds of nothing at all, and began to [Meditate].\nIt sensed a subtle field of energy passing through the room, and the ability seemed to latch onto it somehow, slowly absorbing a trickle of energy into the rock, converting\nsomething\ninto a strand of Qi. Slowly,\noh so slowly,\nit began to expand.\n200 years passed. And this time, nothing really did happen.\nExcept at the very end.\nYou have gained the title:\nGrandmaster of Closed Door Cultivation\n!\nEffects: Cultivation speed gradually increases the longer one stays in closed door cultivation, not moving an inch.\nLevel up!\n10 / 10 Qi\nYou have reached Cultivator Level 2!\nYou are now in the\n[Energy Refining]\nRealm.\nStats up!\nEnergy Level (E) =\n10 W\nQi to Next Realm =\n0 / 50\nProgress! And what progress it was, the energy at the rock’s fingertips had increased ten-fold! Truly, it felt lucky to have received such a convenient class. All it had to do was sit in one place for a few hundred years, and it would gain a level-up and advance a realm!\nHow convenient!\nThe rock knew not of spirit pills, young masters, or even jade beauties—though it might have appreciated the last of those.\nThe fate of a rock cultivator, was it to find a jade beauty, or to become a jade beauty? Few know the answer, but perhaps this rock would be able to find the key.\nAdvancing a realm, it felt the Qi vessels in its body expanding, thickening, and strengthening. Still a bit pathetic, so perhaps it was not the greatest of achievements, but…\nAll it had to do was sit still, and wait around. Who would say no to such convenient gains?\nEspecially with the new title at its fingertips…\nClosed-Door cultivation. The rock rather liked the idea. Perhaps rocks and trees are truly the ones most suited to a life of cultivation? We shall find out.\nBecause… the rock was still stuck. It dared not even try move, lest it lose the benefit of its title, hard-fought to gain.\nSo, once more, the rock sat back to wait, and to [Meditate].\n200 years passed in a flash. Absolutely nothing happened in the cavern. Every once in a while there was a slight tremor or rumble in the mountain, and the rock would worry about whether the whole place would collapse, trapping it inside, but the magically reinforced dungeon walls held.\nOccasionally, animals. Beasts and people found their way inside the cavern, but finding nothing except a gloomy room and a stone in the middle, they soon departed. Some creatures moved in to live at the very mouth of the complex, but the deepest pit was left alone, too far out to be bothered with.\nWho wanted to go down several 50-meter pits to find some part of their base?\nSo, the years passed, and once more the rock received a notification at the end of its long task.\nLevel up!\n50 / 50 Qi\nYou have reached Cultivator Level 3!\nYou are now in the\n[Core Formation]\nRealm.\nStats up!\nEnergy Level (E) =\n100 W\nNext Realm = Breakthrough needed.\nNew Ability Gained!\nStone Skin\nUse your Qi to harden your skin to be—\nERROR_INVALID SKILL\nSKIN IS ALREADY STONE\nFinding solution, please wait...\nPlease wait? That suited the rock fine. It patiently waited one year for the prompt to resolve. If the wanted to play the\nwaiting\ngame, that was absolutely fine.\nSolution found!\nCreating new skill....\nNew Ability Gained!\nDiamond Skin\nUse your Qi to harden your skin to be tough as diamonds!\nIt was a rather simple solution for something the system had taken a year to calculate, but balancing such things was\nprecise.\nThere was no way the system could afford to be careless, for example by forgetting to assign a new creature appropriate STR and INT stats, leaving the old metric system and such in their place.\nLuckily nobody would be careless enough to do\nthat,\nright?\nThe rock whistled innocently under the system’s gaze. And then got back to waiting and cultivating. But—it found a problem.\nIts new stage of cultivation required something called a “Breakthrough”. Simply sitting back and using [Meditate] didn’t quite qualify anymore. And was the rock ready to become a great philosopher, and ponder the meaning of its own existence?\nNot quite yet. In order to gain breakthroughs of the mind, one must go out, and seek out new experiences. Adventure, comrades,\nlove.\nA rock of course couldn’t know anything of such things, so breakthroughs would probably be rather difficult. The best it could do would be to go out and touch some grass.\nBut… did it have the energy to escape?\nTime to test out this cultivation thing. The rock threw the full might of its cultivation base into an [Energy Shift], pointing its acceleration vector right at the stairwell which led into the room.\nERROR_PLEASE_STOP\nResolving Math....\nSimplifying...\nObfuscating...\nNerfing...\nFinished!\nEnergy Shift activated!\nConverting [Qi Energy] to [Kinetic Energy]!\n10W * 1s = 10 J\nConverting to Velocity... Δ0.001 m/s\nNew velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n:\n0.001 m(s\nIt… was not enough. The rock nudged itself forward just a bit, then started rolling backwards, ending up right where it began. For just an instant, the rock felt despair, and depression.\nBut it was a rock. It forgot them soon, and got back to waiting, all rock-like, without any more strange cultivation business.\nThis too was nice.\nBut… fate had not forgotten our hero yet. Just as the rock began to fade back into its familiar state of resting, a tremor went through the mountain.\nAnd finally, after 500 years of not much really…\nSomething happened.\nBecause suddenly, a dragon crawled down into the cavern, looked at the mana-reinforced walls at the bottommost chamber, and patted the rather nice-looking rock in the cavern gently. It nodded, great red head of scales and horns approving the area.\nThis would serve it well. A new lair.\nAnd so, the rock received… a roommate.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 5 192m\nFull Status:\n[Unnamed]\nTitle(s)\n:\nLine-Ender, Patient Ambusher, Bane of Demons, Grandmaster of Closed Door Cultivation\n🗿\nHP\n: 11/21\nMana\n: 0/0\nLevel\n: 7\nExperience\n: 0/250\nClass\n: Rolling Stone\nSub-class\n: Cultivator\nRace\n: Gneiss Stone\nGold\n: 0\nSTATS\nDiameter (d)\n: 1.03m\nMass (m)\n: 1466.7kg\nEnergy Level (E):\n10W\nQi: ???/???\nABILITIES\nCollide\nSteer\nEnergy Shift\nPivot Point\nLike a Rock\nMeditate\nDiamond Skin",

      "content": "The rock carefully focused on being just [Like a Rock], making sure the dragon would not notice anything strange about it. After all, it was just your average rock. What could be strange about such a thing?\nSo the dragon did not notice anything strange, and just nodded approvingly at the Gneiss decoration it would have for its brand-new lair. A proper centerpiece for its display. And so, it began decorating.\nAnd how would a dragon decorate a lair?\nAlthough their intellects were great, their sort actually had rather simple desires, which naturally reflected on the décor of their living environment.\nFirst, the gigantic green-scaled monster reached into its [Astral Pocket], and began taking out its favorite arcane lighting. Great gleaming orbs which emanated light in a dazzling array of colors were spread out all around the cavern, where they floated in midair, like suspended droplets of water.\nNext, the dragon looked to the corners of the room, and inhaled—then\nbreathed out\n. Fire. A great cone of Dragonfire was sent at the corners of the room, and the dragon spun languidly around in a circle, dragging the ray of fire with it, covering each and every corner.\nDust was burned off, and eternally burning Dragonfire was left behind in flickering patches, giving the room a distinctive background tapestry.\nSo, the walls and ceiling were handled, and all that remained was the floor space. Giant red eyes focused on the stone, calculating its optimum placement relative to the other things. Once more, the dragon reached into its [Astral Pocket], this time opening it wide, facing the room.\nAnd an avalanche of gold spilled out.\nCoins, golden coins of all shapes and sizes, with the stamps of a hundred kingdoms on them spread out to cover every inch of the floor. The dragon reached out with its great muscled tail, and lifted up the stone, setting it up at the very top of the golden mountain.\nAnd then it looked over its small kingdom, satisfied.\nFor it was time to engage in the favorite pastime of dragons. In a way, it was kin to stone. For they both had a shared patience born of immortality.\nThe dragon curled in place, around the mountain of gold, and fell asleep.\n—\nAnd the rock looked out at its new sleeping roommate, on its new perch atop a mountain of gold. The rock was beginning to understand the cycles of the world. Even if it proceeded steadily down a mountain, it might eventually end up on top of a brand new one. Such is the way of the world, where those who reach for immortality and power will always find a new peak of Mt. Tai beyond the last one.\nBut the stone was not dismayed. So what of peaks? As long as it could level and grow stronger, the world was its oyster. Or quarry. Maybe it would like something like that more. And regarding its next leveling plan… The dragon fire at the edges of the room was steadily heating it up. It could feasibly move just a bit.\nIt ran some calculations in its mind. Could it launch itself out at the dragon, aimed precisely at the head, and then crush it?\nJust imagine the experience gains from that…\nBut a faint sense of danger held the stone in place. It was learning, and though the dragon seemed to be sleeping, there was a trace of awareness there, in the tail that swished about as it slept.\nAttacking it would be… risky.\nPicking up the rock had been so easy for the muscled tail, the rock did not doubt it could be crushed in an instant. Or be put inside that terrifying [Astral Pocket].\nHowever, the rock also noticed something else. The material all around it—this so-called “gold”… It had heard the term before. Where was it? The rock looked over at its stat sheet.\nGold: 0\nAh, that was indeed a stat, wasn't it! Another number that had stayed at the lowest of lows, not raising one bit, no matter how hard the stone had leveled. Could this be an opportunity?\nA cunning plan formed in its mind, as the [Rolling Stone] embarked on the most traditional of activities to be done inside a dragon’s lair: Thieving.\nCarefully, it converted a hint of heat into movement, and aimed it all downward.\nEnergy Shift activated!\nConverting [Thermal Energy] to [Kinetic Energy]!\nΔ1K = Δ1 m/s\nNew velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 1\nm/s\nRemaining stored Temperature: 20 K\nA slight tremble went through the mountain of gold coins as the stone was lodged down into its core, just a bit. A few coins lodged themselves into the stone's skin—exactly as planned.\nThe stone felt at the golden coins penetrating its exterior and carefully reached out with its new Qi vessels, extending tendrils of energy toward them. Its stone flesh shifted and parted, and slowly, so so slowly, the coins started to be absorbed inside the rock. Until finally…\nGold: 1%\nThe number had gone up!\nBut wait… something was odd. The stone felt around at its body, and realized that the gold percentage numbers were… off. It had absorbed three entire gold coins, but only a small bit of that gold had actually remained in its body, right at the center. The rest had disappeared\nsomewhere.\nBut where? What was going on? The current gold content was nowhere near 1% of the stone’s mass.\nBrimming with curiosity, it focused on its task again, waiting for its body to heat up from the energies around it until it could use [Energy Shift] again, and then it again lodged itself down, greedily slurping up more golden coins.\nAnd slowly, over the days, months and years, as the dragon slept along peacefully… the number went up.\nGold: 10%\nThe first milestone, when the stone had only just begun excavating out its new mountaintop. Once it crossed the decimal barrier, it felt a shift in energy, as something began to form at its very center. It was growing heavier, despite not gaining levels.\nGreedily, it went on.\nGold: 50%\nAt the halfway point, it felt the energies roiling inside it focus more, and a heat began growing at its very center. It was a strange sort of heat—one it could not utilize for [Energy Shift]. But it was incomplete, not ready for use. Something was missing.\nThe mountain of gold was already half gone, devoured by a greedy stone, and still the dragon had not noticed. Because the change was so\ngradual. Slow.\nIn its sleep, it could not notice the mountain slowly getting lower and lower week-by-week.\nGold: 90%\nThe mountain of gold was almost gone, and the stone had to begin harvesting the gold on the floor of the room. But it was close.\nSo, so close.\nThe energies were almost complete, almost in their final form, and just that final stretch was missing. A final burst of energy, which would give the Karp enough energy to leap over the waterfall.\nAnd still, the dragon slept, unaware of the treachery.\nGold: 99%\nThe rock was vibrating, eyeing the last mounds of gold in the room. There was little left, for the number grew greedier the more the stone ate. The last 10% had taken almost as much as the first 50% had. But it was close, so one more time, it focused towards a pile of gold.\nEnergy Shift activated!\nConverting [Thermal Energy] to [Kinetic Energy]!\nΔ2K = Δ2 m/s\nNew velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 2\nm/s\nRemaining stored Temperature: 20 K\nIt rolled over the coin pile, making sure the surface the stones hit was suitably heated. It had optimized the process. By now, its Qi was an expert at gathering up all the lodged-in gold, then harvesting them towards the center, towards the growing core.\nLike a hero finally spotting the inn beyond the next hill, it ran forth, pursuing that perfection.\nGold: 100%\nAnd it was done. The stone rumbled. What would happen now? A one hundred percent golden...\n[Core]\nLevel up!\nBottleneck broken!\n100 / 100 Gold\nYou have reached Cultivator Level 4!\nYou are now in the\n[Golden Core]\nRealm.\nStats up!\nEnergy Level (E) =\n10 000W\nNew Stat Unlocked!\nCore Heat:\n400 K\nProgress to next realm =\n0 / 100\nA roiling core of golden energy formed at the stone’s center, the reward of ceaseless patience, and naturally, patience was rewarded. Because the stone had utilized a nonstandard technique, one that was rather... demonic.\nNew Ability Gained!\nStolen Cultivation\nCultivate further by absorbing the energies of magical treasures.\nBut as that invisible hand descended on the rock, granting new abilities for feats done and experience gained, it noticed something. Things were…\nwrong.\nThe rock had grown in\nmass>.\nEven though it was not supposed to. Its was tied intrinsically to its\n,\nin a formula that\ncould not be broken.\nAnd its was supposed to grow directly depending on its level. But it had not leveled.\nERROR_LEVELING_FORMULA_BROKEN\nMASS TOO BIG\nFinding solution, please wait...\nThat invisible hand noticed the marks of many previous patches, all done in despair to fix an initial error that could no longer be corrected. It was too late to convert the values to Values.\nSo it gave up, and threw out the fastest possible fix. Just... nudge the numbers forward so things would be right.\nSolution found!\nApplying patch…\nFixing numbers...\nLevel up!\nADMIN_PASSWORD / 500xp\nYou have reached level 8!\nStats up!\nMass (m)\n: 1466.7 kg -> 4950.1kg\nDiameter (d)\n: 1.03m -> 1.54m\nHP: 21 -> 34\nWARNING!\nGaining from absorption disabled.\nPlease behave.\nThe rock watched it all calmly, a bit disappointed at that last addition. Leveling up could have been so much easier…\nBut just as it was about to get back to its abilities, to testing out its new , something else happened. The roiling energies in the room were finally noticed. And...\nThe dragon woke up.\nEven it could not sleep through a cultivation breakthrough happening right by its head.\nBut as it groggily rose up, it looked around its room and saw [Just a Rock], an ordinary rock. No cultivation there.\nAnd no gold in its cavern.\nIts nostrils flared out, fire roiling out of them, and the dragon made a mad roar to the heavens.\n“THIEVES!”\nLike a viper, its tail lashed out, grabbing the stone. Because it had need for a weapon, and it had been years since the dragon had last thrown stones at pesky [Adventurers], who sneaked into its lair to covet the golden hoard.\nBoiling from anger, the dragon spread out its great wings, and began lumbering out of its cavern, then crawling up the long pit up, and then\nflying\n.\nUp.\nAnd the rock, which was clutched firmly in the dragon’s tail as it flew higher and higher into the clouds, noticed a detail most alarming.\nIts quest number was going\nup.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 8 292m\nFull Status:\n[Unnamed]\nTitle(s)\n:\nLine-Ender, Patient Ambusher, Bane of Demons, Grandmaster of Closed Door Cultivation\n🗿\nHP\n: 34/34\nMana\n: 0/0\nLevel\n: 8\nExperience\n: 0/1000\nClass\n: Rolling Stone\nSub-class\n: Cultivator 4\nRace\n: Gneiss Stone\nGold\n: 100%\nSTATS\nDiameter (d)\n: 1.54m\nMass (m)\n: 4950.1kg\nEnergy Level (E):\n10000W\nCore Temp (T):\n400K\nABILITIES\nCollide\nSteer\nEnergy Shift\nPivot Point\nJust a Rock\nMeditate\nDiamond Skin\nStolen Cultivation",

      "content": "On a certain mountaintop, high above the clouds, a hero and a villain were having a grand battle.\n“Take this—[Divine Darkness Sword of Banishing Pesky Heroes]!”\n“Hah, that is nothing against my [Aegis of Beaming Holy Light for Repelling the Nasty Darkness]!”\nIndeed, while a rock had been busy sitting around, a few hundred years or so had passed—and the time of great battle had come once again.\nGrand spells and abilities were flying every which way, tearing apart the landscape and slicing up the clouds below. It was a very grand battle indeed—one that would decide the fate of the world.\nAnd then a dragon flew by.\nThe roaring hulk with scales of green and red interlaced in a blinding pattern flew by the dueling pair, sending gales of storm wind at the mountaintop.\nBoth combatants were distracted for just a second, but unluckily, the [Hero] happened to be on the side nearer the dragon, and was sent tumbling to the ground by the gusts. The Demon Lord took hold of the advantage, and thrust his demonic weapon right into the human’s chest in a final killing blow.\n“Hah, now that you are finished, my reign will last for 666 years, dooming humanity to an eternity of servitude!”\n“No—foolish demon. There will always be another noble [Hero], ready and wiling to—”\nAlright, let us ignore those two for now, irrelevant sideshow that they are.\nBack to our\nreal\nhero. No brackets around this one, for he was just a [Rolling Stone]—or rather—a\nflying\none.\nThe stone observed its quest counter, feeling quite a bit of alarm.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 10 222m\nWhat a catastrophe! The number was higher than it had been at the very start of the journey! Were all the trials it had faced for naught?\nFor a brief moment—the rock felt a hint of despair in its soul. But then it calmed down, mostly because it was a rock. A rock really shouldn’t be panicking at every little thing. Especially as…\nSTATS\nDiameter (d)\n: 1.54m\nMass (m)\n: 4950.1kg\nEnergy Level (E):\n10000W\nCore Temp (T):\n400K\nYeah, come what may—it had already met great success in this journey. Maybe the destination didn’t matter, and the real treasure was the gains one made along the way.\nThe rock felt at peace—freed from its monumental quest, learning valuable lessons of life.\nAnd then the dragon started diving down again, for it had surveyed the peaks, and realized that neither hero or demon were possible culprits for the sneaky thievery. It had only come to check up on the mountaintop because it was a\nmethodical\ngiant lizard—who approached pest control like a [Maid] approached cleaning a dusty library.\nStart from the top, then work your way down.\nAnd so the dragon flew down—wings held close to its body, transforming it into a veritable missile of aerodynamic potential. And the rock was still in its grasp. Celebrating.\nBecause the quest number was going down again—so fast!\nThe rock forgot all the lessons and tranquility it had learned from glimpsing the peak of Mt. Tai, and fell back to its old ways. Numbers above all! A quest started would have to be completed!\nSo—deeply content—the rock settled itself back inside the comfortable tail it resided in, and decided to wait and see what would happen. Who knew—maybe the dragon would even carry it all the way to the bottom of the mountain? Now\nthat\nwould be fortunate.\nSo, we return to the dragon, who was circling the mountain in a descending loop, examining every inch for pesky [Adventurers] who might have made off with its treasure.\nIt circled and circled, swooping high and low, peering into caverns and caves—finding only goblins and rabbits. But… it was not in a hurry. It approached the matter with a dragon’s patience, one only rivaled by those of stone birth.\nEventually, satisfied with its search of the bare mountaintop regions—the dragon finally decided to enter the second stage of its search, and it swooped lower. Below the clouds—and a brand new panorama expanded before the stone.\nTrees, grass, bright flowing rivers, peaceful and picturesque valleys, and the delicate fauna making a living.\nIt was a sight brand new to the rock, a realm full of life which stood in stark contrast to the desolate zones above, and the rock almost gasped with admiration and wonder.\nNot at the scenery, mind you. No—as always, the rock was focused on the really important things, namely, the little screen in front of it.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 4 782m\nThe number was past the halfway point! Its quest was nearing completion!\nWhat great joy—perhaps the dragon would even be generous enough to carry it along the rest of the way? Like a marathon racer finally reaching the final stretch, the rock felt its anticipation grow to never-before-seen heights.\nWhat would it get from completing the quest? Could it really be done?\nAnd… what would it do after it?\nThat last question… it bothered the rock. For it had no larger purpose, just that of its stone brotherhood. Follow the whims of mistress gravity, and roll to where it was supposed to go, guided by fate.\nCould it really be satisfied with such a life?\nWell, yes. Probably. It was a stone, it didn’t really have complex desires.\nFinding a nice, cozy moss bed to sit around in would suit it just fine—at least once it had grown larger than any of its kin it had seen on this grand voyage. It still had a ways to go for that.\nAnd so, future plans clear and resolve sharpened, the rock prepared for the last leg of its journey.\nWhich was, naturally, when the complications arose. For the dragon finally found its quarry. Inside a quarry.\nAn adventuring party of four members, a [Knight], a [Cleric], a [Mage], and a [Thief]—male human, female dwarf, female human, and female elf respectively. A rather… generic arrangement. The dragon snorted at their composition, muttering something about\nPathetic harems with only one man for three women\n, then swooped down closer.\nFor who else could be the culprit? The [Thief] was even carrying a big bag with a money symbol at its side.\nThe party was shambling out of a mountainside quarry, loaded with gains from a long day of adventure. Exhausted, battered, and ready to drink themselves dull at a tavern, they were gathering the strength needed for the long voyage down the mountain.\nWhich was naturally when the dragon announced itself.\n“Wretches!”\nIt shouted, sending a great shockwave through the landscape, which made trees swing around wildly and birds fall from the sky—dead on the spot from burst blood vessels. The dragon glared maliciously at the adventurers who were stunned from surprise, staring up at it blankly, and slowly coiled its tail back.\nIts great wings paused their flapping, and the dragon began dropping down from the air, every muscle in its tail readying itself simultaneously.\nThe dragon gathered speed, falling towards the adventurers like a doomsday meteor, then swung its great tail out, suddenly shifting its flight up.\nThe sole male member of the party recognized the maneuver from the world he had been summoned from, screamed something about “damned dive bombers,” and then readied his sword to oppose the payload dropped at him.\nNot a bomb—but a… stone.\nOur hero found itself flying faster than it had ever before, right at the [Knight’s] glowing magical sword.\nCurrent Velocity: 51.2 m/s\nNow, with its brand new [Diamond Skin], the rock may have been able to oppose the great sword of Damocles preparing to flay its stony hide, but it had a better plan.\nIt observed the [Knight’s] companions, arrayed around him in a triangle formation, some distance away. It threw a mental three-sided dice, landed on the human mage, and prepared itself.\nIt neared the knight, getting razor-close to him, and then…\nPivot Point activated!\nDirection: Left\nRotation: 90\n°\nIt pivoted to the side, dodging the sword completely, and crushed the unsuspecting [Mage] against the cragged mountainside.\nCollide activated!\n[Unnamed]\nDealt 38.2\n*\n4950.1 / 4\n= 47273 dmg\nto\n[Magus Élena]\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 8.9 m/s\nCollision Damage received!\nHP 21/21 -> 19/21\nThe [Mage's] fleshy body was reduced to bloody pulp, and so great was the impact, that even the stone received damage from it.\nThe remaining momentum bounced it up the mountainside, and it gained a half-dozen meters on the surprised adventurers, who were staring at their slain companion with open horror.\nThe rock bounced up… up the mountainside, then slowly—inevitably—aided by a side of sly braking with [Energy Shift]… it slowed. Stopped.\nThen started rolling back.\nHaving gained a measure of heat from the braking, the stone had a small reserve it could use to boost itself forward further, which it did with eager pleasure—wanting to reach the thrill of speed the dragon had helped it to.\nCurrent Velocity: 51.2 m/s\nAlas, it could not quite reach it, even powered up by its bursts of speed, but nevertheless, it once more rammed into the party. It was [Steering] carefully, once more aiming at the [Knight], who was glaring with hate at the murderous boulder, ready to slice it open with his sword, his two remaining allies standing on either side of him. Once more, he readied for a challenge.\nBut this time… Just before reaching him—the rock used one more [Energy Shift], using the rest of its stored energy, putting all the kinetic energy gained\nto the left\n. Right at the Squishy looking [Thief].\nHowever, the [Thief] was no fool, and dashed behind the [Knight] for cover right when the rock shifted towards her, in a fast [Backward Leap].\nBut the rock too was ready. It prepared its [Pivot Point]—then attached it to the [Knight]—\nAnd began swinging around him in a wide arc.\nPivot Point activated!\nDirection: Left\nRotation: 270\n°\nFirst, it hit the surprised [Thief], who was squished against the rocky exterior, and then continued forth, promptly adding the [Cleric] to the pileup.\nTwo more of the party were struck by the rock, then carried back to the mountainside, and crushed against it. This time the rock used [Diamond Skin] with all the might in its cultavion base, not eager to face any more self-damage.\nDiamond Skin Activated!\nPower: 10 000W\nCollide activated!\n[Unnamed]\nDealt 25.7\n*\n4950.1 / 4\n= 31804 dmg\nto\n[Cleric Kati] & [Unlucky Thief Aino]\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 0 m/s\nTwo more bodies were broken, crushed together into a vaguely humanoid paste, which slowly started dripping back down the mountainside.\nThe rock lost its momentum.\nAnd then… once more… started falling back down.\nBut the [Knight]... he was just staring forward blankly, no longer even holding his sword up. The light of his life was gone, three times over, and the emptiness was simply too crushing for him to handle.\nHe stumbled onto his knees, covering his face with shaking arms as wailing sobs left his mouth.\nAnd then a rock rolled over him.\nCollide activated!\n[Unnamed]\nDealt 10.2\n*\n4950.1 / 4\n= 12622 dmg\nto\n[Knight Lord Mathias]\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 0 m/s\nAnd then there were none.\nAnd the dragon, who had watched all this come about as a result of throwing one ordinary stone numbly blinked its eyes—disbelieving. What was the world coming to? Adventurers couldn’t even handle one simple thrown stone—\nwhy\n,\nback in the day there had been whole proverbs about how those who cast the first stone would eventually come to regret\nit!\nBut with one simple toss—all its foes had been vanquished!\nSighing, the dragon began to swoop back down, ready to search for the magical tools left behind the adventures, but… the bodies it found were empty. Crushed, yes—but also empty of all magical tools.\nWere adventurers really this weak these days? That would explain some things…\nFor a moment, the dragon felt a hint of suspicion and gazed forward into the forest where the stone was happily rolling onward. Where had its hoard of treasures gone?\nBut the rock… it was [Just a Rock]. Nothing special to it. Not really worth fetching any more than the myriad other boulders scattered about the mountains. And so the dragon began flying up, soul weary, once more reminded of how weak the world of today was compared to the days of old, ready to once more curl up into a slumber of aeons.\nAnd a rock celebrated.\nLevel up!\n1000 / 1000xp\nYou have reached level 9!\nStats up!\nMass (m)\n: 4950.1kg -> 16706.7kg\nDiameter (d)\n: 1.54m -> 2.31m\nHP:\n34 -> 55\nNew Ability Gained!\nAvalanche\nGather the other rocks and stones around you, and bring them along for your journey.\nIt celebrated not just the levels, growth, and skills gained, but also the magical treasures it had absorbed within itself, which it was busy converting into cultivation energy.

The goal, it now knew, had to be there. Because… the number was just so low.

      "content": "Time.\nIt was finally time.\nA long journey—several hundred years in length—was finally coming to an end.\nThe rock saw the destination of its fate.\nA gleaming city, nestled under the great mountain’s shadow. Hundreds of little buildings all arrayed, behind circular walls, like a waiting crowd, anticipating the rock’s arrival.\nIt shouldn’t disappoint them… right?\nIf one were to arrive to a party long awaited—one should do it with style. It was one of the most important qualities of a true hero. No half measures—when the quest’s completion was in sight, it should be completed\nright.\nSo that nobody would argue about the aftermath. Nobody would doubt that yes—it had indeed been a hero that had done that.\nSo—before embarking on its final journey—the rock first looked over its quest counter.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 1823 m\nIt had some space to work with. A bit under two thousand meters of altitude to gather a worthy party to advance with it. Because... this rock would not be arriving alone. It looked over its new skill again.\nNew Ability Gained!\nAvalanche\nGather the other rocks and stones around you, and bring them along for your journey.\nA skill to bring other rocks with it… a novel concept. But the rock liked it. If it was to become the largest and greatest of all rocks,\nof course\nit should have an appropriate amount of followers tagging along!\nIt had seen how the party of [Adventurers] had operated, a group of four—united in purpose. But their fault had lain in their poor coordination. Rocks were much better at teamwork—just push them all down a cliff, and they would gather up more and more support as they went along.\nSo—the rock finally stopped braking along its path—started speeding up—and started looking about.\nIt was in a forest now. Trees, grass, bushes, animals—all manner of new things to observe, but also a place where it had to constantly [Steer] this way and that, bobbing and weaving between the trees.\nBut—it was not a forest of solely green. The rock felt at its cultivation, and it had a sense of its burgeoning next stage—of what would come after core formation. It was a shift in focus, away from the rock itself, and toward its environment.\nSo, it reached out for the simmering embers of that slowly forming sense and threw out a presence—searching for its kin. Other rocks.\nAnd it found them. All over the forest—under moss and under brush, forgotten by time or newly arrived—there were rocks. Big ones, small ones, medium ones. Different shapes and sizes, different materials.\nThe rock got a vague sense of their locations, and set out towards the largest collections, activating its new skill at the same time—slowly beginning to form a true [Avalanche].\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 1425 m\nFirst, it passed by a field of gravel, and the bits started billowing around it, in a growing storm. The rock gained followers, and moved on, searching for its next target.\nIt carefully used [Steer], [Pivot Point] and [Energy Shift] to skillfully weave through the woods, and the cloud of gravel followed—thinning slightly against the brush.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 1215 m\nNext, the rock passed by a trio of large standing rocks, and collided against them, activating [Diamond Skin]. The first cracked into smaller pieces at the hit, and the rock pivoted around to the other two, smashing them to bits too.\nSmaller stones, about head or torso-sized ones were left behind in the aftermath, and they all joined the rock in its pilgrimage. A congregation of gravel and stone, steadily advancing, gaining on the town below. Already sensitive animals could feel a growing rumble in the ground, and the wise ones were fleeing to the sides, well in advance of the advancing tide.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 1128 m\nThe forest cleared for a bit, as the rock entered a clearing of exposed bedrock, where [Miners] would pass long days prying off bits of stone to be worked. Now it was a weekend, and the quarry laid abandoned, resting, a batch of freshly crushed stones ready for the taking.\nThe rock rolled past, its growing herd around it, and the siren call of [Avalanche] rang out. The new rocks shifted position slowly—almost hesitantly, but then the congregation reached them, and the sheer momentum of it all swept them along.\nThe horde grew.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 1000 m\nIt was another batch of denser forest, and the avalanche of rocks crashed and stumbled against trees and brush, but still moving forward with the iron will of gravity. It was not just larger or more notable rocks that joined along—but lone travelers, lost ones too. The odd rock here or there, that had ended up in a lonely spot in the woods, surrounded by naught but greenery.\nGradually, all these sleeping warriors were swept up by a hero’s momentum, leaving their resting places behind, swords sharp. Like an army of the dead, rising up from their graves to challenge the world above once more.\nMany of them had rolled once—felt that intoxication of motion. Such a brief—\nfragile\nthing. An instant of blinding speed and strength, all to end up in an unlucky instant of ending on the wrong side of gravity’s well.\nBut a level 9 [Rolling Stone] would not stop. It would lead its people on—toward their final destination.\nThat gleaming city that was not so far below anymore. The golden city of dreams so many rocks had dreamed of reaching once before.\nSo close—so far.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 811 m\nThe avalanche broke through the treeline, ending up at the cliffside right before the City. Like the condemned walking off a gangplank—they bravely advanced past the cliffside, daring the unknown deeps below.\nFor there were dangers ahead. Even the rock leading the charge knew it.\nThis was where the [Heroes] came from. Even if a demon’s banner would soon rise above the city, this was still the city below a great mountain. A city used to dealing with dragons flying above it.\nThere were defenses.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 650m\nThe rock met the first of them—sensed it a hundred meters before hitting it.\nThe rock had a growing sense of how mana and the energies of the world worked, so it could make out an outline. There was a small brick wall laid out, to protect against the dangers of the mountain.\nDeceptively small.\nThe rock could sense the shield of mana emanating from it and knew special measures would be needed here. It alone could maybe break through—but its followers were different. The other stones did not have the power of [Collision] and [Diamond Skin].\nSo the rock focused on its mana sense, searching for the source of energy for the shield. It felt almost like the dungeon core had—and the rock had had ample time to analyze the aftereffects of that aura afterward.\nIt found the source. A single brick shack behind the barrier—no windows to it.\nThe rock took aim, and increased its speed just a bit more for good measure.\nCurrent Velocity: 35.7 m/s\nPivot Point activated!\nDirection: Up\nRotation: 20\n°\nDiamond Skin Activated!\nPower: 100 000W\nIt crashed into the barrier of mana—and felt resistance in the air against it. But—the rock had and on its side.\nCollide activated!\n[Unnamed]\nDealt 13.2\n*\n16706.7 / 4\n= 55132 dmg\nto\n[Greater Mana Shield]\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 21.3 m/s\nThe shield broke, useless against the stone’s , and the rock pierced right through, towards the shack.\nIt hit the wall, still keeping up its [Diamond Skin], and the shack stood no chance. It blew into pieces, and the rock hit the rich mana crystals sheltered within, absorbing them inside it.\nThey would be processed later—but cultivation could wait for now. The rock had things to do.\nThe [Avalanche] followed.\nThe wall and shack broke down under the torrent of rock, and the broken and battered bricks were scattered into bits, which started following along with the rockslide, growing its mass even further.\nAnd the rock saw the outskirts of town. The walls were not wide enough to hold everyone who needed housing within, so shacks and loose housing had been hastily scrounged together outside, rising high up the cliff.\nThe citizens of the slums saw the rock break through the barrier, and the landslide that followed. Mass panic erupted, people fleeing desperately towards the walls, abandoning their meager houses.\nThe rock sensed victory.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 405 m\nThe rock did not bother to aim for the panicked people running about—it only focused on moving forward, to that eternal goal. It had a more precise estimate now. The city’s walls—just on the other side of it. That was where altitude 0—its goal—lay.\nAnd the rock advanced, an [Avalanche] following it.\nThe rock had no need to kill—for its congregation was a willing enough gang of raiders. The old rocks, finally moving after years of rest, ran eagerly towards the slaughter, facing classes and combat abilities, creating a carnival of blood worthy of a hero’s arrival.\nAssist Experience received:\n23 x [Civilian] & 89 x OTHERS\nAdding...\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 200m\nShacks were battered down, people were crushed into bits, bones were split in two—but the [Rolling Stone] only saw forward. It abandoned its congregation, leaving them to their bloody task—\nAssist Experience received:\n89 x [Civilian] & 231 x OTHERS\nAdding...\nThe rock launched itself over a moat, now seeing the terrified citizens arrayed on top of the city’s walls. Its sudden advance had taken only a scarce two minutes, but already the city was reacting, and people were rushing atop the wall, led by a withered old man in a huge billowing wizard’s cloak.\nHis veins thrummed with energy, and he stared disdainfully at the rock.\nBut the rock did not see him. Only the number. Almost there.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 78m\n[Supreme Grand Magus Oldivar] pointed a finger at the [Rolling Stone], beginning to cast a spell, and the stone launched itself up, using all its held energy, pivoting for a great leap over the wall.\nPivot Point activated!\nDirection: Up\nRotation: 60\n°\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 62m\nThe rock could see the other side of the wall, and it was like an ethereal hand was guiding it—it knew the exact place to land. A small plaza with a fountain and a jade statue of a beautiful woman. But the rock saw not the woman’s beauty, only the shine of the jade.\nThe level 5 [Cultivator] finally beheld a true jade beauty, and it hungered for that landing—for that reward.\n[Supreme Grand Magus Oldivar] finished gathering energy—and began casting the spell.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 35m\nThe end was in sight.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 25m\n[Supreme Grand Magus Oldivar] began speaking.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 20 m\n“[Greater Reverse Gravity].”\nThe stone felt a great jolt go through it—all its gathered momentum suddenly flinging it up.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 60m\nIt saw the ground shrinking below it—and desperately threw out every ability it could, using every bit of energy within to reach that promised land. But the spell was stronger, even [Pivot] did not work.\nWas this finally the vengeance of the system?\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 200m\nBut it only accelerated even more upward. Every action led the rock further and further up, and it felt the energy leaving it.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 600m\nSo fast—it was accelerating too fast. It was all… ruined.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 1200m\nThe rock cried out in despair, reaching forward with hands it did not have, at that land that was growing more and more distance below it.\nBut still, it kept accelerating.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 2400m\nIt finally gave up, growing dull—just blankly watching the number go up and up.\nAnd oh how up it went…\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 15000m\nFar above the mountains now, and the rock finally saw that the peak it had started on was merely one among many, just one speck along the great spine of the continent. It finally beheld how tiny it truly was, and fell still.\nIt waited—for something to happen. Surely there would be another chance?\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 200 000m\nIt was so far away now… But as long as it was patient—surely patience would be rewarded? Surely it would get another chance at that promised land?\nIt could see the curvature of the surface now and understood that so much of what it knew was just an illusion. A brief spark of adventure started to light up inside the desperate soul. If it kept going up… what could it find?\nCould it find a way to become stronger, to face that horrible man once more and laugh?\nAnd then—as if hearing a plea—something answered.\nClass Advancement unlocked!\nConditions fulfilled!\nYou are now eligible for the class: [\nMeteorite\n]\nUpgrade Class [\nRolling Stone]\nto [\nMeteorite\n]?

      "content": "The rock calmly pondered over its class option. It did not hurry to choose it, nor did it delay in choosing it. It was a simple being, and after briefly considering the implication, but not too deeply, it picked it, no further hesitation.\nBecause… it was in space now. Away from the mountain, away from the ground. It was no longer rolling. Now it was more like... spinning, really. Could it really consider itself a [Rolling Stone], if it no longer rolled?\nOne had to be true to themselves.\nCongratulations!\nYou are now a level 10\nMeteorite\n!\nSize scaling factor increased from 1.5 to 2!\nStats up!\nMass (m)\n: 16706.7kg -> 133653.3kg\nDiameter (d)\n: 2.31m -> 4.61m\nHP:\n55 -> 89\nNew Subability Gained!\nPivot Point: Orbital Slingshot\nLock into orbit around an astral body, gradually gathering speed, then launch yourself forward!\nSkill Shift!\nAvalanche -> Meteor Shower\nGather other rocks around you, and take them along for your astral voyage!\nThe rock looked over its changes, satisfied. Two skills had changed, not in ways\nthat\nsignificant, but changed nonetheless. Additionally… the stone had grown quite a bit larger.\nIt rather liked that.\nThen, like the prompt thinker it was, the stone moved to the next issue on its list: The gemstone of rich mana lodged within it, that it had yet to begin absorbing.\nIt reached out with tendrils of mana, poking and prodding at the crystal, slowly but surely absorbing it inside it, drinking deeply of the magic and growing its cultivation base.\nStolen Cultivation Activated!\nConverting Artifacts to power...\nComplete!\nLevel up!\n1000 / 1000 Magic\nYou have reached Cultivator Level 6!\nYou are now in the\n[Molten Core]\nRealm.\nThe gemstone was rich in energy, having powered a whole city’s entire mana shield, so the rock wasn’t too surprised that it was enough for the breakthrough. But—well, few things could surprise a rock. It had a stoic countenance, reacting to whatever came with the same stony calm.\nAnd thus, once more… it grew.\nStats up!\nEnergy Level (E) =\n1 000 000W\nCore Heat:\n1000 K\nProgress to next realm =\nBreakthrough needed.\nThen, having finally solved the first two issues on its list, the stone finally turned to the third: Its circumstances. Perhaps it had subconsciously put it last, out of a vague sense of avoidance. Because… the stone did feel annoyed.\nVery annoyed.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 363 300 000m\nSo far\n. Further than it could have ever imagined going. It had been so close. So close! Almost reaching that desired goal, seeing it before its eyes. The numbers had been only two digits before!\nAnd now, as the rock used [Orbital Slingshot] to remain in place as it thought, there were nine. Nine digits, when it had been almost one.\nIt could still remember the visage of that jade statue at its journey's end, the form of a graceful woman clad in a toga, reaching up to the sky, as if to welcome the rock home from its long voyage. The rock had leaped out, grasping for those arms, but fallen short.\nBecause of that man. Not that\ndamned\nman—the rock didn’t feel hate or anything of the sort. It just… wished the man hadn’t been there. But, like so often before, the rock had been powerless to oppose others taking hold of it, and carrying it wherever they pleased.\nFirst, it had been the goblins, then the hunter, and then the dragon. All picking the rock up, and doing what they liked with it. And the rock had been fine with it, as long as they helped it go along to its destination, making the numbers get smaller.\nIt had been better than being stuck in place. At least until the final case, the [Supreme Grand Magus].\nBut now… the rock realized something. If it truly wanted to roll this path to its end, it would have to do it with its own power, not that borrowed from others. Because otherwise, those others would drag the rock along—using it for their own agendas.\nNever again. So the rock promised itself.\nAnd then—only then—did the rock cast its senses out, and really\nlook\nat its surroundings.\nIt saw the planet below. A blue jewel, scattered with green continents all over it, coated with a fluffy covering of clouds. The world it had spent all this time in, without realizing its true shape. Because… now the rock realized it. The world it had been living in…\nIt was just a very big rock.\nOne with people and towns and dragons and dungeons in it, mind you. But the base material was still stone. And the rock remembered its original goal.\nIt had wanted to be the biggest rock of all.\nAnd now it felt humbled, finally realizing the monumentality of its task. But… it did not despair. It did not jump for joy. It just calmly opened up its stats screen and checked the number listed there.\nDiameter (d): 4.61m\nThen it closed the screen, and once more observed the planet in front of it. If it was estimating things right... and it probably was...\nThe rock had quite a bit of leveling up to do.\nBut then it saw the shadow being traced along the world’s canvas and witnessed the moon rising up from behind the planet, like a brilliant pearl emerging from the ocean of blue.\nAnother big rock.\nThen it finally noticed the smaller rocks around itself—fallen members of its rocky congregation, which had made it through the slums, and been launched outside the planet’s well of gravity along with our hero. Small stones, and smaller bits of gravel. Sand—or just\nvery small\nrocks\n.\nBig rocks and small rocks.\nThen it turned its senses outward, towards that brilliantly glowing orange orb, so small in the starry sky. Or just...\nso far\n?\nJust another rock—a glowing one of course—perhaps the biggest one of all.\nAnd so the rock realized a critical truth of the world. At its core—\neverything was rocks\n. All the way down. Some were just a bit bigger than others. For now at least. Fundamentally, the rock was no different than the planet below it, or the grains of sand floating beside it.\nIt was only a difference of scale, and power.\nLevel up!\n1/1 Philosophical breakthrough!\nYou have reached Cultivator Level 7!\nYou are now in the\n[Planetoid Domain]\nRealm.\nStats up!\nEnergy Level (E) =\n100 MW\nCore Heat (T): 2000\nK\nNew Stat Unlocked!\nDomain size (d)\n: 1.0KM\nProgress to next realm =\nBreakthrough needed\nNew Ability Gained!\nKin of Stone\nHaving realized the truth of all stone, you can now sense the others of your kin within the solar system\nThe rock felt a new sensation spreading out from it, a domain or field of some sort, then realized it was the same field it had felt once in that dungeon—when it had first begun cultivating. If the planet had a field like that, and the planet was just a big rock, why should it not have one too?\nIt was all starting to make sense.\nAnd the new ability, as the rock focused on it, it felt a map of sorts opening up in its mind. Stones, rocks, pebbles,\nso many of them,\nall orbiting the great giant in the center of it all in an elaborate astral dance. Smaller ones orbited larger ones, which orbited yet larger ones. Many were the size of the planet below, and some were even larger than that.\nOthers were a bit larger than our hero, part of a vast field of rock orbiting in the midpoint of the solar system.\nThe rock had much to do. It used [Meteor Shower], and began gathering the disparate and battered pieces of its legion back together, a reforged hero’s band. It cast out its senses and felt many, many more rocks, spread out all over the starry sky, ready for it to collect into its following. Its new congregation slotted in naturally within its new domain, orbiters of its own.\nOur hero once more looked down at the planet below and made a decision.\nAs it was—it was too weak. It could still remember the iron grip of the gravity spell upon its stone flesh, forcing it up and up. It... did not want to feel that again.\nSo—it would not hurry. It would travel the starry sky, and collect a greater following of rocks. It would grow even larger. And then… once the time was right…\nIt would return. And not be turned back again.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 370 200 123m\nWith a final glance at its distance number, the rock gave a silent goodbye to its home world, released itself from the [Orbital Slingshot], then used [Energy Shift]—changing Qi to momentum—and began accelerating more and more, away from its home, towards the other gatherings of rocks it could feel. Towards that great field of stone in the distance.\nIt would be back soon. In the timescale of rocks of course.\nA rock had all the time in the world, and the patience of stone. And it noticed one last detail, after continually using [Energy Shift] to accelerate forward.\nCurrent Velocity: 751.7 m/s\nIt was no longer slowing down.\nFull Status:\n[Unnamed]\nTitle(s)\n:\nLine-Ender, Patient Ambusher, Bane of Demons, Grandmaster of Closed Door Cultivation\n🗿\nHP\n: 89/89\nMana\n: 0/0\nLevel\n: 10\nExperience\n: 0/5000\nClass\n: Meteorite\nSub-class\n: Cultivator 7\nRace\n: Gneiss Stone\nGold\n: 100%\nSTATS\nDiameter (d)\n: 4.61m\nMass (m)\n: 133653.3kg\nEnergy Level (E):\n100 MW\nCore Temp (T): 2000\nK\nDomain size (d)\n= 1.0km\nABILITIES\nCollide\nSteer\nEnergy Shift\nPivot Point\nPivot Point: Orbital Slingshot\nJust a Rock\nMeditate\nDiamond Skin\nStolen Cultivation\nMeteor Shower\nKin of Stone",

      "content": "Far, far from home—a lonely traveler sped on through the infinite expanse of the universe.\nIt traveled amidst glittering stars, under the steady shine of the sun, and inside the infinite expanse of emptiness.\nIt also traveled… alone.\nOnly now did the rock\ntruly\nunderstand what that meant.\nIt was a solitary thing, used to spending eons calmly resting in place, letting the world pass on. But. There had always been something.\nIn the narrow crevice between two boulders, the rock had watched the rabbits frolic, evading hunters and foraging for the scarce offerings of autumn.\nIn the deeps of the dungeon, it had watched as little spiders crawled about, spinning their webs in a myriad of infinite patterns, a fragile tapestry upon the dark ceiling.\nEven before it had truly known consciousness, when it had just been a normal rock, it had in some way watched the clouds roll by above, and the eagles dance among the winds.\nAlways, there had been\nsomething\n.\nLife.\nBut now, it only had a silent congregation of gravel and stone following it, mindlessly attracted along by a skill, a [Meteor Shower]. But it was not\nlife\n.\nHowever, the rock did not despair, nor did it get depressed. Because… it had never truly understood life. Why did the spiders spin those webs, when they were always reduced to dust in a matter of months? Why did the rabbit frolick and produce offspring, when they too would all pass in a short few years?\nThey did not\ntruly\ngrow. A short burst of life, before inevitably succumbing to the tyranny of time.\nThe rock did not care for time, so it knew itself to be superior. It had traveled a long time by now. Was the wizard who had cast it out here already dead, reduced to dust?\nThat was why it carried no hostility, no ill will. Why worry about revenge or such when one could just\nwait\ntheir enemies out\n?\nA lesson many other immortal [Cultivators] could have learned much from.\nBut the rock did not know that, so it focused on its one\ntrue\ntraveling companion. Because… were you ever really alone in this world?\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 179 500 123 222m\nThe rock never closed the screen anymore, it just let it stay there, steadily ticking up and up, a reminder of home, a constant companion.\nAnd a promise of return.\nWhy worry about loneliness or time, when you could instead focus on\nnumbers\n?\nThen, the numbers finally crossed a threshold, and the rock focused, instantly shedding off all semblances of hibernation.\nBecause it would soon arrive at its next destination.\nSeeing the map of the solar system with [Kin of Stone], the rock had plotted a simple course: Go where there were the most appropriately sized rocks, so that it could collect an army worthy of its return.\nIt had plotted out a course towards the great belt of rocks it had seen outline, somewhere in the midpoint of the solar system.\nBut… it had run into a problem.\nCurrent Velocity: 5 511.7 m/s\nThe rocky field which had seemed so grand on its mental map… was actually really sparse.\nThe distances between each rock were vast, and most annoyingly of all, the stone could not just speed through them all, dragging them along into its wake.\nNo, it had to\nslow down,\nslow enough to pause for a moment at each stone, where it could then grab them along to its [Meteor Shower].\nAnd the kicker? There was no more eternal grip of gravity pulling the rock down here, so slowing down actually took\ntime.\nThe same amount of time speeding up took, really.\nNo longer was it a rock-et. No the stone’s racing flight had turned into a crawl.\nBut still, this newest spot… it might just prove more fortuitous than the others.\nBecause—as the rock gradually slowed down and looked over the large planetoid it had arrived at, it noticed something. The planetoid, just a fancy term for a big stone really, was not alone—it had orbiters.\nThe stone was large, much larger than the rock itself—but that no longer bothered the stone like it had used to. As a level 7 [Cultivator] it could sense the relative powers of beings much better, and it knew the barren stone in front of it carried no spark.\nBut… it was a bit too large for the rock to take along as it was. So, without any further hesitation, the rock promptly put its [Energy Shift] thrusters on, activated its [Diamond Skin], and crashed into the larger rock as fast as it could.\nCollide activated!\n[Unnamed]\nDealt 332.1\n*\n133653.3 / 4\n= 11 096 565.2 dmg\nto\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 4723.1 m/s\nThe planetoid shattered into bits, crumbling into smaller chunks, and that was normal. But what confused the rock was…\nThe orbiters. They did not instantly start orbiting the rock, it would have to use [Meteor Shower] for that.\nBut… why was that?\nWhy did the bigger rock attract orbiters around it, and the smaller stone did not?\nAs our hero pondered this new quandary, it felt itself being on the verge of a new breakthrough. Something resonated in its domain, a concept it could almost grasp for. It was close—so close to understanding.\nIt had made the correct deduction before, that fundamentally, the difference between it and a planet was just a matter of scale, but it had not yet realized the full implications of that.\nBut now it was close, peering over yet another cliff, stuck between boulders, but wishing to tumble down. What awaited below?\nThe rock focused on its [Cultivator] domain. What was this new domain anyway? It had acquired the thing, some sort of boundary or sense that extended to a far distance from it, but it had not yet gotten much use out of the thing.\nBut—if the domain did one thing—it made the rock’s senses sharper. Or no, sharp was the wrong word. Let us go with...\nharder\n. Our rock was more of the round type, not exactly sharp.\nAnyways, moving on.\nAs it focused on the minute movements of the rocks around it, deactivating its [Meteor Shower] skill, the stone finally realized something fundamental. It had been wrong. It had been thought that only the bigger rock had attracted orbiters, but that had been a misconception.\nAgain—it was all just a matter of…\nscale.\nBecause as it looked at the swarm of rocks around it,\nreally looked,\nwith the accuracy of its Qi tendrils, gradually spreading into the domain, the rock found gravity everywhere.\nEvery little floating rock had\nsome\ninfluence, affecting those around it. They all pulled at each other, rocks, gravel, orbiters all, in a dizzying dance that traced impossibly complex patterns over the canvas of stars.\nYes—gravity was everywhere, and in\neverything\n.\nAs the rock focused on its Qi, and reached out with it, filling its domain with energy, it could almost sense an impossibly vast canvas stretching out below it—the invisible power of gravity.\nEven now, here in the emptiest of space, the rock still stood on a hill.\nBut… the rock was also the hill itself, influencing every other thing around it. Still in a small way due to its yet meager size.\nBut… if it reached out with its Qi, tapping into that canvas…\nLevel up!\n1/1 Philosophical breakthrough!\nYou have reached Cultivator Level 8!\nYou are now in the\n[Astral Domain]\nRealm.\nStats up!\nEnergy Level (E) =\n10 000 MW\nCore Heat (T): 4000\nK\nDomain size (d)\n: 100.0 km\nProgress to next realm =\nBreakthrough needed\nNew Ability Gained!\nGravity Launcher\nManipulate gravity with your Qi, launching an object towards a desired location.\nThe stone did not even look at the new screens or try its new ability—it needed none of it. It was focused only on its extending tendrils of Qi, and the canvas of gravity below it.\nAnd it began painting.\nLong, powerful streaks, forming three concentric rings around it, slightly offset from each other by small angle.\nAnd gradually—inevitably—the swarm of meteors, rocks and gravel around it, the [Meteor Shower] itself, started gathering into those three rings. Organizing, spinning.\nAt first slowly, like a nervous dancer attempting their first ballet. But the confidence grew, and so did the speed, and the\nmomentum.\nOnward and onward the rocks spun, forming a dizzying dance around our hero who sat at their very center, focused in serene meditation.\nCurrent Velocity: 0 m/s\nThe rock itself had no speed at all, but that didn’t bother it anymore. Because all around itself, it could look and see\nspeed\n. Velocity. Flight.\nA dance.\nAnd then—finally—it reached for the new skill it had received. [Gravity Launcher].\nIt selected one of the larger rocks in its outermost ring, and activated the skill.\nGravity Launcher activated!\nLaunched at speed 70 m/s\nAnd feeling at the ever-present canvas of gravity, it could sense the rumbles of strength in that shot, as the selected meteor careened off into the distance at great speed. The rock felt satisfied at its new skill, a potent weapon indeed.\nIt rather liked that.\nWho was more fit to cast the first stone than another rock? Rocks knew not of sin.\nAnd so—the rock was just about ready to head off towards the next point on its voyage—when it sensed something…\nstrange.\nIt was part of its [Kin of Stone] skill, and even its domain, now with an increased range to it. It sensed... a\nthing.\nSomething of metal was approaching it, and not just flying at the whims of gravity—but by its own power.\nThe rock instantly grew focused, accelerating towards the object, all three rings of weapons increasing in rotation speed. It got closer to the thing, and eventually sensed it at the very edge of its domain. A being of metal, shaped like a sphere, with a jet of fire coming out of the back and little flashing lights at its front.\nBut—there was something very wrong with it. It was instinctive to the rock, it\nknew.\nThe thing had no levels. It was more like the meteor it had just destroyed—but despite not having any levels… there was a spark within it. Something guiding it along. Intelligence.\nScience. The power of physics and reasoning, applied to create a vessel capable of braving outer space, and capable of sensing oddities there. Oddities… like a rock that played with the very canvas of gravity.\nBut the rock knew the thing was wrong. It did not belong here—in this solar system of levels.\nInstinctively, a classification applied to the thing inside the rock’s mind.\nGravity Launcher activated!\nLaunched at speed 92 m/s\nThe thing tried to evade the projectile, but the rock focused on its domain, painting a valley of gravity for its projectile to travel along, inevitably following the thing.\nIt could not escape. There was an impact, but... no experience. Still, the thing was destroyed, crushed by a projectile as soon as the rock had decided to destroy it. Instinctive.\nBut the rock knew—if there was one—a little scouting drone like this…\nThere would be more.\nSo the rock cast out its senses, looking for any oddities, and felt some vague feeling, almost like excitement, but not quite. The rock wasn’t quite there yet.

      "content": "In the vastness of space, near the edge of our hero’s solar system, a pair of mobile suits were advancing, pushed forward by mighty jets.\nThey were the vanguard of their people’s advance, the brave champions who explored the unknown deep and defeated dangers before they could threaten their push forward.\nThe two giant mechs were rather different in construction. One was a scrappier unit, small and worn, repurposed out of a mining suit. Its grey exterior bore the scrapes of many a brawl, but despite its humble make, it still braved on, driven by a veteran mechanic.\nThe other was quite the contrast. Gleaming, metallic chrome, a larger frame, and high-tech construction formed from the best of their scientist’s efforts. The driver was the young hotshot of the space force, a fresh face compared to the grizzled veteran piloting the other. A mismatched pair they may have been, but their bond was unbreakable.\n// HMS-112, please report in. Over.\n“Roger that, red base, this is HMS-112. Nothing strange detected so far. Over.”\n// Roger. Any sign of the destroyed scouting unit? Over.\n“Roger. Nope, no sign of it yet. Over.”\n// Roger. Be on the lookout, our sensors are still detecting the gravity anomaly in the system. Over.\nThe message cut off with the buzz of static, and the veteran pilot sighed. He leaned towards his microphone, broadcasting his voice to the other mech. “Buddy, you seeing anything yet? Your eyes are sharper than mine.”\n“No—nothing yet. Stay focused,” came the answer.\nThe veteran snorted, relaxing in his seat. It was an important task, but he did not think anyone could stay one hundred percent focused\nall the time.\nEven if their task was the most important one in the world.\nTheir home lay a broken heap, shattered by war, and now only three great colony ships remained of their people. And defending one of the three was up to the two of them. Still, he needed to calm his partner. Nerves would be the death of them.\n“Hey—relax for a moment there. There haven’t been any nuclear-class energy signatures in this solar system yet. We’ll be fine.”\nThere was a moment of silence, and then the communicator crackled again. “… I’m just—worried. The main ship is trailing too close to us. It should have stayed further back. Something isn't right about this place. Like an itch.”\nInternally, the veteran agreed, but calming his partner was priority number one, so he spoke in a relaxed tone. “Don’t worry, they have sensors to detect any possible hostile ships. And think of the probabilities. What are the chances that something would really be out here, in the middle of this solar system? Life is rare enough.”\nSuddenly, a sensor started blaring, and a red light filled the cockpit.\n// SENSOR ALERT. OBJECT APPROACHING AT RAPID SPEED.\nThe veteran instantly kicked his legs into pedals, activating the thrusters, and pulled his joystick back, rotating the suit around 90 degrees, then thrusting up—just as an asteroid streaked below it.\n“Kinetic bombardment!” he shouted, pressing every single button in his cockpit because the people who designed their control scheme had no mercy.\nMore asteroids were coming now, and he saw that his partner had activated the [High Tech Convenient Lazer Sword] of his suit, and was slicing the meteorites into bits and pieces, dancing a rhythm of destruction among them all.\nThe veteran’s worn fingers finally prevailed, and he managed to type in the launch sequence. “Activating [100 Homing Photon Missiles]!”\nStreaks of light started to spread out from his photon-volt pack, homing in on the countless meteors streaking around him. Then… things went wrong.\n// GRAVITY ANOMALY DETECTED\nThe veteran’s eyes widened as the missiles suddenly began veering off course, crashing into each other, almost as if they had all suddenly fallen into a deep bit together.\n“Hey—are you seeing this? I’m not getting any energy signatures!” he shouted, putting his thrusters at 100% capacity to escape the field. “We need a visual!”\n“I have one,” came the curt reply, cracking with static. A marker appeared on the veteran’s HUD, right between the fuel level indicator and the idle-clicker game he always kept at the edge of the screen.\n“That’s no enemy ship—” the veteran said, eyes widening. Because what he saw was not an enemy ship, looming above them, ready for battle. No—what he saw were rings. Three rings of rocks, all rotating around one central figure. “—that’s a rock.”\nIt was stationary, flinging rocks at them, almost as if it was observing. Testing.\n“I’ll take care of it!” The veteran said, opening a hatch under his desk, revealing even more buttons, and starting to press all of them sequentially. “Activating [Homing Lazer]!”\n“I’ll cover you,” came his partner’s calm reply.\nReassured, the veteran pilot kept pressing the buttons with his left hand, while using his right to reach out for the USB-mouse stowed under his chair, which he then attached to his main control panel. It took him three tries to get it in the slot, but once he did so—a targeting reticle appeared right above his eyes.\nCarefully, he moved the mouse, hands shaking from nerves, and right clicked on the rock’s position. A menu opened.\n// Lock in lasers? Y/N\nHis partner had realized that just cutting the meteors into smaller pieces of shrapnel wasn’t actually helping much, and moved up to shield him with the [Indestructible Particle Shield].\nThe veteran’s hand stopped shaking, reassured by his partner’s presence, and he clicked the left mouse button.\n// Launching [Homing Lazers]\nA single beam of light shot forward from his reactor core, moving much slower than the speed of light but still pretty fast, and split apart into hundreds of beams, which all began bouncing towards the central rock.\n“I’ve got it!”\nThe rock moved its rings to block off the beams, but the beams dodged behind it, striking at its rear. The veteran cheered.\n“I’ve got a hit!”\n// ANOMALY DETECTED. TARGET IS VIOLATING THE RULES OF THERMODYNAMICS.\nThe veteran’s eyes widened as he tried to read the message which had appeared way too close to his face, and they widened even more when he parsed the meaning.\n“What? How can it—”\nHe clicked the little\nx\nat the top-left of the message with his USB-mouse, making it disappear, then looked at the scene. The rock was still there—absolutely fine. And moving.\n// TARGET HEATED UP BY 150K\nHe clicked the new pop up away too, cursing. “This doesn’t make any sense! How can it do that? That's not how any of this works!”\n“Doesn’t matter. Just need to deal. I’m going in,” came the younger pilot's reply.\nThe veteran pushed his thrusters further, reaching 200% power utilization, and rushed to back up his buddy who was rushing into battle. Because the rock had also started rushing at them.\n“It’s accelerating!” The veteran shouted, pushing his thrusters to 300% power utilization.\nHis partner bobbed and weaved, then drew out a second [Lazer Sword], and reached the rock. “I’ve got it!” The giant robot slashed down, red and blue swords lights reflecting against its chrome finish, just about to hit the rock.\nAnd then the rock…\npivoted.\nRight around the mech, revealing a barrage of meteors behind it.\n// ANOMALY DETECTED. TARGET IS VIOLATING THE LAWS OF PHYSICS\nWith horror, the veteran watched as two trailing rocks clipped his partner’s mobile suit, smashing its left arm off.\n“Taking critical damage!”\n“I’ve got you! Activate the thing!”\n“Roger!”\nThe veteran pushed his thrusters to 500%, then took his hands off the controls, clapping them twice.\n“Activate motion controls!”\n// Synchronising…\nHe stood up from his chair, crossing his arms beneath his chest, looking down the hatch at his partner’s mech, and his suit mirrored his every movement.\n“It’s time to show this rock that the Heavy Metal Systems mark 1 and 2 are no ordinary machines!”\nHis partner’s mech also went into gesture control mode, and the remnants of the destroyed arm were cast off, revealing a USB slot.\nOne matched the USB connector that had just appeared on the veteran’s own scrappier suit.\nTogether, they shouted out the key phrase. “Activate [Combination Sequence]!”\nThe two mechs slotted together, one becoming the arm of the other, and all the lights in the cockpit turned red.\n// INCREASING POWER AVAILABILITY TO 1000%\n// SYNCHRONISING..\n// COMBINING...\nA single tear dropped from the veteran pilot’s eye. “Using the power of our bond, we cannot—”\n“Brother! It’s not letting us do the transformation sequence!”\n“Wait, wha—”\nTHUNK\nCollide activated!\n[Unnamed]\nDealt 202\n*\n133653.3 / 4\n= 6749492 dmg\nto\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 211.3 m/s\nThe rock passed right through both mobile suits at once, wondering why they had clumped together like that for it. They had become much easier targets, staying in place for so long as they had.\nBut the mystery soon passed from its mind, as the rock looked over the results of its hunt.\nTwo large battered husks of metal, controlled by two smaller fleshy things inside them.\nIt was… an interesting idea. Something about it lodged into the rock’s mind, to be parsed later. But then it moved on—towards the bigger target.\nThe rock used [Energy Shift], and began using its Qi base to accelerate towards the\nmuch larger\npiece of metal, which had begun reversing course in the distance. They were trying to escape from the rock!\nOf course, our valiant hero could not allow such a thing, and followed them patiently, gradually gaining speed.\nAnd gaining speed.\nAnd gaining speed.\nAnd gaining speed.\nIt finally reached the giant colony ship, a huge mass of pipes and wires, and like a golf player on the green, began lining up a shot. If it got this one\njust right…\nIt [Steered], then [Pivoted], managing to find that perfect spot.\nWhere it could pass through the whole body of the ship, along its length axis.\nIt accelerated more, and activated [Diamond Skin] with the full power of its Qi, and hit the ship.\nCollide activated!\n[Unnamed]\nDealt 900.1\n*\n133653.3 / 4\n= 30 075 334 dmg\nto\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 323.1 m/s\nA collapsing metal husk was left in the rock’s trail, exploding further and further in a chain reaction until only bits of scrap were left floating in the emptiness of space. And the fleshy bits that had been inside, controlling the larger metallic hulk.\nAnd so the war between worlds came to an end, fought with laser sticks and stones, as was once prophesied. But rock always won.\nRock, paper, laser. It was written in the rules.\nBut… seeing the results of its work, the rock was curious. For it was new to most things, and only knew some. But the way a smaller thing could control a bigger thing…\nIt\nfascinated\nthe rock. Because the system had stopped it from doing a certain thing before, and that had set the rock’s progress back significantly.\nIt began collecting the bits of metal, new additions to its growing [Meteor Shower], when a notification finally appeared in front of it.\nOutsider Incursion Cleared!\nCongratulations!\nBonus Experience awarded!\nLevel up!\n20 000 / 5000 xp\nDiscarding overflow xp\nYou have reached level 11!\nStats up!\nMass (m)\n: 133 653.3kg -> 1 069 226.4kg\nDiameter (d)\n: 4.61m -> 9.23m\nHP:\n89 -> 144\nNew Title Granted!\nGalactic Defender\nReceive information about tier threats to your home, and gain bonus experience for defending the world from them!\nGalactic Defender Alert!\nClass 10 [Doomsday meteor] will hit [Planet Dirt] in 230 years!\nStop it to gain bonus experience!\nAnd so, the rock finally learned its home's name, but what was this? The rock focused on its [Kin of Stone], sensing a new presence being added to the map, much further away than any of the others.\nMuch larger than our rock.\nBut the rock… it felt offended. Some\nother rock\nwas going to go to its home before it?\nUnacceptable.\nIt began accelerating towards the new signal.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 187 300 122 111m\nFull Status:\n[Unnamed]\nTitle(s)\n:\nLine-Ender, Patient Ambusher, Bane of Demons, Grandmaster of Closed Door Cultivation, Galactic Defender\n🗿\nHP\n: 144/144\nMana\n: 0/0\nLevel\n: 11\nExperience\n: 0/20000\nClass\n: Meteorite\nSub-class\n: Cultivator 8\nRace\n: Gneiss Stone\nGold\n: 100%\nSTATS\nDiameter (d)\n: 9.23m\nMass (m)\n: 1 069 226kg\nEnergy Level (E):\n10 000 MW\nCore Temp (T): 4000\nK\nDomain size (d)\n= 10.0km\nABILITIES\nCollide\nSteer\nEnergy Shift\nPivot Point\nPivot Point: Orbital Slingshot\nJust a Rock\nMeditate\nDiamond Skin\nStolen Cultivation\nMeteor Shower\nKin of Stone\nGravity Launcher",

      "content": "A rock is never late, nor is it ever early.\nBecause rocks do not count the years. They do not take note of the time. But… there were numbers that the rock cared about. Mass. Diameter. Velocity.\nFrom those three, most other things followed. The rock had a simple philosophy: If it encountered a problem, it would strive to increase those three numbers, and usually, the problem would be solved.\nIt had worked this far.\nAnd so, as the rock finally arrived at the [Doomsday Meteor], after a long age spent in travel, it took note of the numbers.\nIt knew how fast it was approaching the other. It knew how fast the other was growing in its sight. It could estimate things. Running a patient calculation in its mind, the rock estimated the [Doomsday Meteor].\nIt was about... 10 000 meters wide, and assuming it was as dense as our hero, it would probably weigh around 1 361 356 816 555 580 kilograms. A simple calculation for our rock. And a clear result.\nIt was... quite a bit bigger than the rock.\nBut—the bigger rock had no spark. As it cast out with its [Cultivator] senses, our hero saw that there was no will guiding the [Doomsday Meteor] forward, just the iron grip of gravity.\nDid it feel disappointed? Maybe. Perhaps the rock had hoped to encounter someone of its kin finally. What would that meeting be like?\nThe closest it had ever gotten was the earth elemental, but that had been a construct of magic controlling rock, not a true rock itself.\nA cousin at best.\nSo, when it saw that the giant meteor had no spark, the rock did not\nexactly\nfeel saddened, because it did not know what it had lost. But any potential hope was extinguished, and a journey of anticipation was turned to normalcy.\nThings remained the same.\nBut still, the rock did not rush to battle its larger kin, it did not rush to destroy it. Nor did it try to absorb it into its asteroid swarm, or to turn it off course using its gravity abilities.\nNo—for a while, the rock just watched. And thought. It remembered the people of flesh, who piloted the metal shells from within. A smaller thing, controlling a bigger thing.\nAnd the rock had an idea.\nThe system had forbidden it from absorbing new mass directly, forcing it to grow through levels alone. But our hero was not one to follow convention and regulation when a more straightforward path was presented.\nFirst—it experimented.\nThe rock stopped the three concentric rings of asteroids around it, pausing that eternal dance for a brief moment. Then it painted a deep well of gravity on its own position, a deep hole, and sat down at the very bottom.\nAnd the other rocks started falling in. Gathering. Collecting.\nUntil the rock was covered by a vast layer of stone, extending its size hundredfold. And it felt…\nright.\nLike something that made sense.\nBut as it moved, the shell shifted too, following along like a loose blanket of pebbles.\nNot an iron shield.\nThe rock realized that composed of single bits like that, it was too fragile of a thing, not like the ironforged suits of the fleshy things. But…\nOnce more it observed the giant meteor ahead. That one would do very well indeed.\nAnd so the rock finally accelerated forward, flying towards that craggy exterior. But it did not speed too much, it moved slowly.\nCurrent Velocity: 18.2 m/s\nBecause the rock did not want to smash the meteor to bits. It had to stay together, all in one piece for the rock’s plan to work. A simple plan, the same one it had always had. Increase mass, increase diameter.\nAnd it landed on the surface. On a hard, rock-solid surface. One much like its own, although the precise composition was a bit off.\nHow could it get inside?\nIt again remembered the two suits of metal, and especially the other one. For although it had not seen use in the battle, it did have a very distinctive shape attached to its right arm. A tool of a former mining suit.\nA drill.\nThe rock focused on its [Diamond Skin], this time trying to make something… different. Not a covering all over, just one spot. It gathered up all its Qi, sending them not to the surface, but just beyond. Forming an arrowhead of diamond, extending out of the rock like a unicorn’s mighty horn.\nIt aimed the drill head towards the [Doomsday Meteor], and again did something different, something new. It used [Energy Shift], but did not do the same kinetic energy conversion as always.\nNo—it created\nrotation.\nThe rock started spinning, drill head against the giant, and began burrowing inside. Rock was forever, but so were diamonds, and so the drill pushed through.\nNot in a hurry. Not in a rush.\nCalmly. Methodically.\nThe drill crushed bits of rock to dust, which the rock then had to move away, using [Meteor Shower] and little channels of gravity. Occasionally it had to pull out, letting the crushed pulp dribble out, and then it would head back inside.\nAnd soon, very soon, the rock reached the center of the meteor.\nIt stopped the drill, letting the diamond bits formed from Qi fade away, and focused its senses. Focused its\ndomain.\nBecause what really was the difference between the rock it was inside of now, and itself? Why did the rock have a spark, and the [Doomsday Meteor] did not?\nIt gathered up its domain, the great boundary extending out, and began\ncompressing it.\nBecause it fit\njust\nover the meteor, like a well-sized glove. Closer and closer.Onto the very surface of the giant meteor, until it was almost bursting through at the seams.\nAnd then it began infusing the whole region with Qi, taking control.\nThe rock felt Qi vessels sprout and spread out through the meteor, like little cables of electricity, spreading out to cover it wholesale. And gradually, its consciousness expanded.\nIt could\nfeel\nthe larger body of rock. Not as its own, but like an attachment. And it was fixed firmly inside.\nNext, the rock painted a deep well of gravity on the hole it had dug through, and let rock and dust fall back inside, blocking off the ending. And then it tried to activate [Diamond Skin]. A brilliantly gleaming shell spread out.\nAnd it covered the whole asteroid, giant thing as it was. Even the hole the rock had burrowed inside through.\nThe rock felt at its grown mass—larger than any it had seen on the mountaintop.\nThen—with an exertion of gravity—it gave the whole mass the tiniest nudge. Sent it off course.\nAnd a planet was saved.\nGalactic Defender Quest Cleared!\nCongratulations!\nBonus Experience awarded!\nExperience gained!\n5 000 / 20000 xp\nThe rock was not too pleased by the lack of a levelup, but on the other hand, it did not need the system's help to grow. Nor to learn new skills.\nIt had grown a lot larger by attaching itself to the larger rock and taking control of it. It had learned to do that all by itself, solely by practicing its Qi manipulation.\nIt felt at its new form, more connected than before, and gave it another nudge. Just the tiniest one.\nGalactic Defender Alert!\nClass 10 [Doomsday meteor] () will hit [Planet Dirt] in 220 years!\nERROR_THIS_IS_YOU\nINFINITE XP GLITCHES ARE CURRENTLY DISABLED FOR [unnamed]\nNOT ELIGIBLE FOR A QUEST REWARD\nYes, the rock nudged the course right back where it had been—not because it had tried to fool the system into granting it infinite experience, although that would have been nice, but because this form was worthy. This form was large. With this form—it had grown enough to challenge its foes, to reach the end of its quest.\nBut, it had only grown the first two of its three key numbers. A true solution still needed that final bit, and our hero was no mere lifeless [Doomsday Meteor].\nIt used [Energy Shift], and began accelerating. Not just mass and diameter, but velocity too.\nAnd a number began shrinking.\nThe old one, the one it had been following for so long, but a new one too. The new one moved slowly—very slowly. Because it was not easy to accelerate so much new mass. But… it too began shrinking.\nQuest:\nPlanet Destruction\n: 220 years\nAnd eventually ticked over, after a long time of accelerating.\nQuest:\nPlanet Destruction\n: 219 years\nYes, this number too was shrinking now, faster than it should have. And the rock rumbled inside its new shell, anticipating a grand homecoming.\nAnticipating the end of its quest. That jade statue, reaching out towards it.\nNow\n, it was really time.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 14 959 787 069 100m\nFull Status:\n[Unnamed]\nTitle(s)\n:\nLine-Ender, Patient Ambusher, Bane of Demons, Grandmaster of Closed Door Cultivation, Galactic Defender\n🗿\nHP\n: 144/144\nMana\n: 0/0\nLevel\n: 11\nExperience\n: 5000/20000\nClass\n: Meteorite\nSub-class\n: Cultivator 8\nRace\n: Gneiss Stone\nGold\n: 100%\nSTATS\nDiameter (d)\n: 9.23m (10km)\nMass (m)\n: 1 069 226kg (larger)\nEnergy Level (E):\n10 000 MW\nCore Temp (T): 4000\nK\nDomain size (d)\n= 10.0km\nABILITIES\nCollide\nSteer\nEnergy Shift\nPivot Point\nPivot Point: Orbital Slingshot\nJust a Rock\nMeditate\nDiamond Skin\nStolen Cultivation\nMeteor Shower\nKin of Stone\nGravity Launcher",

      "content": "On a certain mountaintop, high above the clouds, a hero and a villain were having a grand battle.\n“Take this—[Final Super Attack that Is Not Even My Final Attack]!”\n“You cannot defeat my [Mega Casting: Fire Inferno: Flare Ember Mode: Astral Activation]!”\nGrand spells and abilities were flying every which way, tearing apart the landscape and slicing up the clouds below. It was a very grand battle indeed—one that would decide the fate of the world.\nAnd then it was decided.\nEMERGENCY BROADCAST\nThe world will end in 60 minutes!\nPlease beware meteor showers.\nThe two paused, letting their attacks fade, then looked to the sky. They did not see it yet, but they could almost sense an oppressive presence. Growing.\nThe hero and villain shared an uneasy gaze and nodded at each other. They turned to face the meteor. They would meet it in a battle and see which one would win.\nAnd so, the world finally came to peace.\nEven as the citizens all over the world panicked and screamed, shouted and cried, ran and hid—the rock did only one thing. It kept accelerating. But it was so—so slow. The body around it was large—and heavy. It did not accelerate easily. It had not been moving that fast in the beginning. But it had gotten faster, gradually increasing its speed.\nIt would not be stopped again.\nCurrent Velocity: 108304.0 m/s\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 389 894 400m\nTime remaining: 60 Minutes\nThe timer was actually shrinking a bit faster than the 60 minutes indicated within, because the rock was still accelerating. The system did not seem to account for such things.\nBut it saw the world—its homeworld down below. And the planet prepared.\nTime remaining: 60 Minutes\nThe [Mages] of the world gathered in a hasty remote conference, arguing over who would get the glory of saving their world. But practicality won out, and the newly elected [Supreme Grand Magus] of a certain city with a jade statue won out—because they had foretold.\nThat was the landing zone. And there was no time.\nAll the mana of the world was sent to the man, channeled through remote connections and ancient treasures, and he held the power of the world at his fingertips. For a brief moment.\nAnd he cast a spell, high atop his tower, gazing at the meteor through magnification spells. His skin crackled with mana, and he was barely holding himself together, but he raised his arms and cast the spell. The grand one they had all prepared together, fit to make a rock go away.\n“[Supreme Greater Anti Gravity Grand Magic].”\nThe rock sensed the blast of magic approaching itself. But it had learned. It saw gravity better than any other on this planet—for who was more its child than a stone, not rolling, but falling?\nIt felt at the canvas of space below it, tilting it just to the side—\nAnd the blast missed it, careening off to the side, all the mana spent. Wasted.\nThe rock calmly kept accelerating, and the [Supreme Grand Magus] retreated down from his tower, escaping to his wine cellar, awaiting the end.\nTime remaining: 40 Minutes\nAn ancient dragon lumbered out of its cave, weary of the world, for it saw its own mark of fate on this doomsday. That was why it had retreated here, for whenever a dragon interfered—disaster soon followed.\nAnd now it looked up at the greatest disaster of all—the end of everything. It did not know how, but somehow the dragon had played a part in this. The thought was a crushing dread, and the dragon...\nFelt tired. Weary.\nStill, the great dragon, one of the last of its species and certainly mightiest of them all, gathered the roiling heat in his lungs, staring up at the rock, which it could\njust\nmake out with its supreme eyes.\nIt breathed out, and a bright beam of magma was shot at the meteor, one last attempt to do\nsomething.\nBut it too failed, because the rock did not care for the laws of temperature. The mighty blast hit the rock in a blast that shattered the sky, but only heated it up more.\nAnd the rock continued converting that heat to movement.\nThe dragon saw that it had once more only hastened the end, and retreated back to its cave, weary of this world. It would sleep through the end.\nTime remaining: 2 Minutes\nA hero and a villain stood side-by-side, atop a mountain, having formed their plan. They had combined their two techniques, and the hero was holding a grand sword in his hands, shaking with power.\nHe could now see the stone, invisible as it still was, because he was a [Hero] and could always see the enemy. He raised his sword high, and its tip cut the clouds. He sliced it down, using every technique available to him, and a great blast of energy was sent at the rock.\nThe rock activated [Diamond Skin], fueled by a roiling core of Qi, and the sword of a [Hero] scratched through 1000 meters of rock. But there were 9000 more, and the rock quickly began repairing the damage with its Qi.\nThe hero fell to his knees atop the mountain, overcome with despair. The villain did not speak, only stared up at the sky, waiting.\nSo—the mightiest of the world failed to stop the rock, because\nof course\nthey did. Even had they blasted it to pieces, those pieces would still have been falling down. Even had the [Mages] managed to send it back up, a ceaseless meteor shower would have followed in its wake.\nAnd the rock would have returned—even bigger than before.\nEventually.\nBecause the rock was inevitable. And so—it descended down on the planet, satisfied that it had grown past all its former foes. None of the mighty could sway it.\nBut… when has this ever been a story of the mighty?\nEven the rock had humble origins.\nWinding the clock back a bit, to before a notification told the planet of its doom, let us follow a different young hero. A human one, not a [Hero]—but a [Bard].\nA young woman, 21 years of age, with auburn hair. She was dressed humbly, but well enough to serve at a court. She had a lyre in hand, a treasure she had toiled on endlessly for many a year.\nBut… her flame was dying out. She sat in the city that was her own, walking around aimlessly, eyes listless.\nBecause the world had ended.\nNot\nliterally,\nof course, but to her, it certainly felt that way.\n“Aah—I can’t believe I failed at the big performance… It’s all ruined now—” she said with the sureness of youth, because her goals and future were ash.\nShe had worked hard for years, and the opportunity had finally come. A chance to perform at the governor’s annual ball, where all the important people of the city could hear her. The chance of a lifetime, the reward at the end of the path she had walked so long.\nAnd she had failed—\ncompletely\n.\nSimple reasons, just nerves and being requested unfamiliar songs, but she had failed spectacularly, stuttering on stage, barely able to play.\nEmbarrassing herself in the eyes of\neveryone.\nReputation in tatters.\nShe would never get hired again.\nAnd she could feel those eyes, as she walked the city, looking for an excuse to not go home. Rumours spread, especially juicy ones like these. She thought she heard every shopkeeper snickering at her turned back, and every window seemed to peer into her soul, laughing.\nBut it was better than facing what awaited at home, so on she walked.\n“Why did I have to fail now of all times… It’s always the critical moments, isn’t it?”\nShe finally stopped, at a plaza she was used to frequenting. A plaza with a Jade statue that seemed to grasp for the heavens, depicting a beautiful woman.\nIt was an old statue—nobody really remembered where it had come from. But it had always been there, and the [Bard] liked to stare at it now and then, and to speak. She could almost imagine it listening.\n“Hey, odd statue. Tell me, do you really have magic powers like rumours say? Because… I could really use a wish.”\nShe looked at the statue, feeling that ever-present, oppressive weight upon her chest. Anxiety and terror, always warring within.\n“Can you just… give me a little excuse? Anything will do. Just so I don’t have to go back home yet.”\nThe [Bard] asked for an excuse, looking up at the statue with pleading eyes… and she received one.\nEMERGENCY BROADCAST\nThe world will end in 60 minutes!\nPlease beware of meteor showers.\nHer brown eyes widened as she saw the notification appear, and she hesitantly turned her head up, searching. She did not see anything yet up there—but she could almost imagine it there. Destruction, imminent.\nAlmost here.\nAnd she felt all her worries, all her anxieties, all the weight upon her chest—\nIt all faded away in an instant, brushed off with the warm spring wind.\nShe smiled.\nThere were shrieks of terror and despair from the few others in the plaza at this hour, panic growing among the other people, but she alone smiled. She spread her hands out, breathed the fresh air in deep, and felt better than she had in years.\n“Yesss!” she shouted, jumping up with joy.\nThen she\nreally\nfelt the looks. Sheepishly, she peered around, seeing gazes of disbelief coming her way. “Ah, sorry about that.”\nThe other people continued screaming and running about. Running away from the plaza.\nBut the [Bard] just sat down, looking up at the statue, finally feeling\nfree.\nCalm.There was nothing to look forward to anymore, so there was nothing to dread either.\nShe only wished this moment would last forever, but…\nTime remaining: 55 Minutes\nIt would be only a short while. She wondered what she should do? In this short moment, with the peace she felt.\nIt was odd—but although she did not want to die, to say goodbye to this lightness blooming in her chest—she had accepted the end strangely easily. She felt no dread.\nThen—she had an idea. The [Bard] looked up at the statue, picked up her lyre, took it out of its case—\n\"Hey statue, do you want to hear a song?\"\nAnd she began to play.\nIt felt easier than in years, the notes flying off her fingers effortlessly. She felt a faded fire begin to burn brighter in her soul, and looked up to the sky—almost thinking she saw that approaching doom.\nThen she sang.\nNot any song she had known before, but a song of complete freedom—free from the expectations of others, free from consequence.\nShe did not have to worry about how other people would like her song. She did not have to think about whether her song could earn money. She did not have to worry about how the song would be remembered.\nIt would all end soon, so why not just play what she really wanted?\nAnd her soul sang. The plaza was clear by now, most people having retreated to friends and family, cellars and bunkers. Her only audience was the statue, which did not look at her. The statue looked to the sky.\nBut\noh how she played! How she sang!\nIt was a song ignoring all conventions, something freer than anything that had come before. She was drumming at the ground with her feet, playing the lyre with a frantic energy she had never felt before.\nTime remaining: 4 Minutes\nAnd eventually, for such a short moment, she began to see the meteor, growing larger in the sky, a bright figure burning against the atmosphere.\nShe did not want the world to end—she wanted to live on. But it would happen. She would not be able to affect this inevitability no matter what she did.\nIf the world was going to end… why face it with fear and dread?\nWhy not instead throw the most glorious of concerts—a symphony for the end?\nAt the most glorious of stages.\nAnd so, the clearer she saw the blinding light in the sky, the louder she sang. No longer words with any direct meaning—just sounds that felt grand and energetic enough for this moment. Almost screams. Her playing grew faster. But the statue was not her only audience.\nSomething above listened. And something else—something that always was there in this world.\nLevel up!\nYou have become a level 9 [Novice Bard]!\nNew music genre invented: [Rock and Roll]!\nTime remaining: 1 Minute\nThe rock could make out the city below, and could see the plaza of its dreams. It was almost there. The end was in sight.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 6 498 240m\nBut then—it heard something. Sound. A song.\nIt had never heard things before.\nBefore its launch into space, it had only been able to perceive the rumbles and vibrations of the earth, for it had no ears to hear with. But in space—it had grown. Developed. Become a master of a domain.\nAnd as its domain focused downward, away from its body, that whole mass of energy searching for that jade figure which reached up for it, the rock heard a song. And… it was strange. Soft, gentle, sorrowful. But still energetic.\nSomething new.\nThe rock had never felt a soft touch or a caring hand before—its stone skin was too tough for that.\nThe rock had never seen color—its vision only showed shades of grey.\nThe rock had never tasted before either—for that least of all was a thing of rocks.\nBut now… it heard music. It had finally been given the senses to perceive such things. It did not see the [Bard] because the rock did not understand humans. It only saw that jade statue, the symbol of its dreams reaching up for it, and heard the song coming from it.\nThe jade statue was singing for the rock—welcoming it.\nAnd in that moment, as the [Bard] looked up at the imminent destruction with glowing eyes—the rock finally felt it in its soul. It understood beauty. It wanted to hear more of the song.\nThe music resonated through its domain for a brief moment, and everyone heard it.\nThe hero raised his head, sorrow draining out of him, and he stood up, side by side with the villain. They held hands, looking the end right in the eyes.\nThe [Magus] rose up from his cellar, abandoning the flasks of wine, and stepped outside. He felt the spring breeze against his skin, and the coming of summer in the air. He smiled.\nThe dragon looked out of its cave once more, and for a moment, remembered the glories it had achieved in life. It closed its eyes, hearing the roars of old friends in the chorus of the song.\nFor a brief moment, everyone listened, and the rock wanted to hear more.\nBut—it was too late.\nGravity, the cruel mistress that it was, once more laughed at the rock. For it had made a mistake. It had worked so hard to make sure none could stop it. It had brought along a greater mass that its [Pivot] could not shift—and now...\nit could not stop itself.\nIn an instant, brave though it was against the storm, the brief ember of beauty was snuffed out.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 0\nResolving...\nPlease wait.\nCRACK\nTitle Activated!\nLine Ender Activated!\nGained 20% damage bonus!\nCollide activated!\n[Unnamed]\nDealt\n14959787069100 *\n108304\n.2 * 1.2 / 4\n= 486062331206766100 dmg\nto\n[Novice Bard Rihito] & [Planet Dirt]\nNew Velocity for\n[Unnamed]\n: 6000 m/s\nDealing splash damage to ERROR_OVERLOAD entities\nResolving...\nPlease wait.\nPlease wait.\nPlease wait.\nThe music had stopped, and so the rock also understood loss. It had never lost anything before. Not really. But the music wasn't coming back, no matter how hard it listened. There was only the brutal symphony of destruction, and then... silence.\nBut numbers went up.",

      "content": "The rock had understood something new. Silence sounded different now, because it had not known the contrast before.\nSilence and song. Beauty and... destruction.\nThe rock had been flung through planet's crust, out of its temporary shell, still hard as diamond..\nIt sank deeper and deeper, trying to escape the silence and the destruction. Up on the surface was destruction, but down below was silence.

Shattering earth and sundered mountains.\nNot the music.\nIt wanted the music.\nIt escaped deeper, sinking further toward the center of the planet, away from it all. But it found more silence.\nThe shockwave finished travelling around the planet.\nSplash damage calculated:\n201 021 321 x [Civilian] & 51 223 001 123 x [Bird] and\nERROR_INTEGER_OVERFLOW\nResolving...\nLevel up!\nERROR_INTEGER_OVERFLOW / 20000 xp\nDiscarding overflow xp\nYou have reached level 12!\nStats up!\nMass (m)\n: 1 069 226.4kg -> 8 553 811.5kg\nDiameter (d)\n: 9.23m -> 18.45m\nHP:\n144 -> 233\nNew Title Granted!\nKill 51223001123 birds with one stone\nDeal 20% more damage to birds\nNumbers, numbers, so many numbers—all going up.\nBut now it was silent. The rock was deep down and did not hear the music. It did not feel the flame of beauty. And it really did want to. It was not depressed. It was not sad. It was not in shock.\nBut it did feel a sense of loss. Frustration. More loss than it had ever felt before, because the rock had never truly lost anything of note.\nThere was no beauty or music up above. It had sensed it—only destruction. Firestorms, magma, a shattered surface. Not even sunlight, for an endless plume of dust and ash was coating the sky, blocking off the day, leaving the land underneath in eternal darkness.\nAnd the loss struck it deep, and so the rock tried to burn the noise out of its mind, for it did not want to remember what it had lost.\nBut a rock did not, could not forget. It was all seared into its mind.\nIt. Could. Not. Forget.\nThat last moment of music played in its mind over and over again, teasing a continuation to the melody, a continuation the rock could never hear.\nLoss… it had lost something.\nThe rock did not even properly process the numbers it was getting as it sank ever deeper into the earth, deep into the mantle of the planet. It did not shift when the planet cast a final shuddering dying breath, nor did it stir when it felt a presence fade away around it, heralding that mightiest of prompts.\nNew Title Granted!\nKinslayer\nDeal 20% more damage to your parents and other family\nTransferring\nPlease wait...\nClass Merge Unlocked!\nMerge classes [Meteroid] and [Cultivator] into [Planet]?\nY/N\nCongratulations!\nYou are now a level 12 [\nPlanet]\n!\nBeginning planetary fusion process...\nIt accepted the prompt, just to make it go away faster. But it did not look at the results. It did not look at the new numbers. It did not observe itself growing and growing, merging together with what was around to become the biggest of all.\nRight now, it did not care.\nNo—the rock clung to one thing only. It had lost something, so it would need to gain something. There was balance in this world, right? A certain amount of energy becomes a certain amount of momentum. That it understood. The world worked with balance.\nIt had spent all this effort struggling for its quest. And the quest was still processing. Waiting to be fulfilled. The distance indicator was bottomed out, but the quest was taking a lot of time to unlock.\nSo—surely the reward would be fitting.\nThe rock clung to hope. Could the quest bring back the music?\nIt did not shed tears. It did not despair. Because it was a rock, and those things were not in its nature. The rock had always had a simple solution to most issues.\nSo it waited.\nAnd waited.\nAnd waited.\nBut the music did not come back. It kept hearing it, at the back of its mind.\nAnd so the rock finally understood the true essence of loss. Because waiting had never before felt difficult. Now it could not wait. That was wrong.\nIt was supposed to be easy.\nNatural.\nSo it struggled as it waited, and the planet rumbled above, merging closer and closer with the rock.\nBut then, finally…\nTutorial Quest\nRoll out\nReach the bottom of the mountain.\nCurrent Altitude\n: 0\nDifficulty\n: Legendary\nRewards\n: ???

(Legendary)\nSTATUS\n: UNRESOLVED\nThe rock watched the final error, trembling, and the newly forged planet shook\nNo.\nIt could not accept it. This was not meant to be.\nIt had worked so hard… and this was the result? At the darkest hour, the hero finally despaired, for it had now lost two things.\nTwo of the few things it had.\nAnd so the planet raged. With strength, it did not yet know, and abilities it had not yet tried to discover, it began shattering itself further. The rock activated [Gravity Cannon], and flung the moon far away, for its gaze felt like a judgmental glare, and the oceans shifted.\nIt raged, and the earth shook, shattering all the mountain ranges, for they reminded the rock too much of its quest.\nThe shattered mountain ranges reminded it of itself, so it flung the chunks of rock into outer space.\nIt raged on, and the oceans boiled.\nAnd then… the rock was done raging—because it did not feel any better. It had never felt emotions like these before—and it did not like it.\nWould waiting make it go away?\nIt tried to wait, but again it felt too restless. Some annoying thing buzzed at it for a moment, but it went away soon enough. The rock was full of energy, but had no goals to put it toward. Everything was gone. Except…\nIt still had its levels. It had grown—it was bigger now. Could it perhaps solve this issue? It had been clever before.\nThe rock decided to try, taking a look at some of its new skills. It had many. Could they solve the problem?\nIt began using [Create Mountain] and [Sculpt Earth], shaping a new mountain from the shattered ground, a copy of the one it still remembered.\nIt had flown over the mountain before, and it had rolled down its slopes. It had waited hundreds of years on the mountain, and it had rolled down it in a brief moment. It knew the mountain well.\nAnd using its new authority, the rock assigned the mountain the name , connecting it to the quest. It waited, waited for the system to come in and resolve things.\nAnd it did.\nTutorial Quest\nRoll out\nCurrent Altitude\n: 0\nERROR\nYou are Mt Tartus, distance invalid.\nSTATUS\n: UNRESOLVED\nAnd it failed again, the destination falling just outside the rock’s reach. It finally felt despair, for a brief moment, as that golden goal it had struggled towards was finally plunged out of reach.\nWas the system perhaps vengeful against the rock? Being petty because the rock had caused it trouble before?\nPerhaps, but the rock did not care anymore.\nAfter trying and failing again—it felt easier to accept the quest was unresolved. Waiting there, like a permanent itch.\nWaiting was easier when you had no hope.\nBut a rock could not wallow around in self-pity forever. The quest was only one of the two things the rock had lost. It still had levels. It still had stats.\nIt had grown. Become the biggest rock of all.\nFor the rock had travelled the solar system and seen that many of what it thought kin were just imitators, giants of gas masquerading as rock. No true kin of stone. And they did not have the spark.\nAnd even if there were bigger ones out there... what did it matter? Had its size really brought it any gain?\nIt had found no success with size. At the beginning of its quest, the humble pebble had wanted to become the greatest rock of all, and all it had thought of was size. But now the [Planet] knew better. Size was one thing, easy to measure, a number it could grow as long as it rolled forward, crushing everything in its path.\nBut what of beauty?\nThe rock looked at its surface, and saw a shattered planet, with no signs of life on it. No music. That was the only beauty it knew.\nThe rock could see it now—imagine it now.\nWhen it had sat upon that mountaintop for a millenia, had the birds always been singing there, a song that the rock had not been able to hear? Had the wind played a soft melody as it blew through cavernous holes, like giant organs played by the air itself? It remembered its old mountain, and thought that perhaps... there had been beauty there.\nThe rock had created no beauty itself. It had only rolled forward and destroyed, seeking the quest and growth. What had it intended to do after completing its quest?\nSo focused on the numbers it had been, that the rock had forgotten everything else. Perhaps because the numbers had been its only companion. Perhaps because it had truly been alone, clinging to the screens of numbers that followed it through thick and thin, just as eternal and patient as the stone.\nBut was there beauty in the numbers?\nDiameter: 12 747 201 m\nIt looked at the number, grasping for that satisfaction it had once felt seeing it grow. But it felt none now. It had reached the peak, and the satisfaction was so fleeting. That melody still played in its mind, never to be forgotten. But the numbers... they all began to blend together eventually. Perhaps there was a brief satisfaction, but now, seeing the peak, they lost all meaning.\nThe rock closed the screen, its one faithful companion, and again thought of that jade statue, that song it had sung for it, and looked over the destroyed surface.\nThe rock realized... it was an ugly rock. No music would spring from this barren surface. Even it knew that much.\nAnd then, resigned, it sat back to wait, wallow out eternity like it had back on that mountaintop. It had seen no beauty then, and it saw no beauty now. Except it now knew it, and that made all the difference.\nFor a long time, it watched the vast field of crushed rock circle the planet languidly, and slowly, the surface calmed. No more hellfire. Just silence.\nIt watched those rocks in its orbit spin and spin, around in endless patterns of gravity...\nAnd it remembered something.\nExperimentally, almost on a whim, it reached for that familiar feeling—the tapestry of gravity—and began to paint patterns in the sky. Gradually, the field of rocks began to gather together, into three familiar shapes.\nRings.\nAnd they spun and danced, and the rock realized it felt the faintest spark of beauty from the dance. It was almost rhythmic now, as if they were following a song. A song that still played in its mind.\nAnd as it continued the dance of rock on and on... the song in the rock's mind changed. Becoming something new. A song it had not heard before.\nThe [Planet] stirred. Perhaps... the rock could create beauty too?\nIt looked over the mountain it had carved and recognized a clumsy sort of artistry there too. A beginner's work. But… perhaps it held the beginning of beauty in it too?\nIt had many new skills. Many new paths to explore. And lots of time.\nCould it make the stones sing?\nThen and there, the rock decided on a new goal for its life. It had become the biggest of rocks and seen what stood at the peak, and found mere strength meaningless. What was the point of being the strongest if you only left destruction in your wake? No, strength for its own sake had no meaning. It had no quest to strive for, so it needed a new goal. No more blindly rushing forward, destroying.\nThe rock was done with that path. Now… it wanted to become\nbeautiful\n.\nIt was a [Planet] now. A grand being with equally grand abilities. To truly become the best rock of all…\nIt would have to become the most beautiful [Planet] of all.\nAnd so the rock began creating.\nSlowly, so so slowly, over eons and millennia, it experimented and learned. And leveled. New abilities, but most importantly, new\nskill.\nIts first efforts at plant life had been clumsy, misshapen things that resembled melted candlesticks. But eventually... it sculpted trees from gemstones, and their emerald leaves rang in the wind like chimes.\nIt raised and sculpted mountains for those trees to rest on, and shaped them so the wind would blow through their labyrinthine peaks\njust right,\nthenhit the trees...\nAnd then the trees began to play a song. The three rings remained above it all, dancing to the new melody in patterns that grew ever more complex, ever more\nbeautiful.\nBut the music was still missing something. It needed singing.\nSo the rock, the newly reforged [Planet], thought of people. It had created a world that played melodies in the wind—but to sing with… you needed people.\nWhat sorts of people should it create? The rock looked over its [Natural Selection] and [Origin of Species] skills, and remembered that jade beauty. That form… it wanted to capture it. Bring it back. That golden dream, capturing even a fringe of its image.\nThe rock reached deep into itself, dragging out veins of jade, and started sculpting them into people, then imbuing them with life.\nClumps of Jade slowly rose up, small cragged figures, far from the sculpted figures in the [Planet's] mind. It began guiding them along, shifting things just right, and slowly, the people evolved, and began to sculpt\nthemselves.\nInto shapes the rock had never even dreamed of.\nBut all still beautiful, a rock’s sort of people. They crafted hair from the finest gemstones, and polished their jade skin so it gleamed in the sun. A united people, for the rock knew not of men and women or their differences.\nAnd the rock did not need to teach them, for the people saw the world around them, and began to sing on their own.\nAnd slowly, so so slowly, the rock watched as a [Planet] filled with life. More and more life. People, animals, plants. Mountains, lakes, forests.\nSongs, so many songs, and the [Planet] listened to them all, spinning the rings around to each tune.\nIt felt content.\nThis beauty did not feel as fresh as that first flame of beauty had, because what could surpass the flame of first love? But the rock was pleased with what it had created. A world of jade, gem and stone that sang. There were conflicts and war, but the rock cared not, for the warriors sang as they charged to battle and bloodshed. It was a fine world. Fit for the greatest rock of all.\nHowever.\nOne thing still bothered it.\nThe quest. The damned quest.\nIt was still there, waiting, unfulfilled. And the rock wanted it solved. It wanted to know! It needed to know!\nThe years had not made it easier. At first, it had tried to ignore it, but the more content it became with beauty, the more restless the rock grew. Once the hook was in, could it ever truly be fished out?\nWhat was the reward for the quest?\nWhat would happen when the numbers reached the end?\nCould it really just ignore it, and leave it unanswered? Of course not!\nBut the rock was big now, and significant. A [Planet] full of life. It could not evade the gaze of the system anymore. It was being watched too closely for that—it would not be able to sneak the quest through any simple measures.\nThe rock hatched a plan. For it was a cunning rock, and had fooled the system many a time before. You just had to know where to look, how to distract, and then a small piece could be snuck away and snipped…\nAnd so, the rock enacted its plan.",

      "content": "First, we go back, to the day when the world ended. That day was a busy day at the Isekai office.\nIt would only get busier.\nSolara, the minor goddess of heroes, had been at her shift for barely two hours, and she already craved a second cup of divine ambrosia, also known as coffee. She stared at the bright-eyed youth sitting in front of her desk and felt her pulse quickening.\n“Excuse me, can you repeat yourself?” She asked, staring calmly at the boy.\n“Well—its just… Can’t you provide me with some super nice cheat skill for my new life? I’m supposed to defeat\nthree\ndemon lords according to this contract of yours, and I think that is a pretty unreasonable ask of me, when I am to have no additional boons to help me along!”\nSolara sighed deeply, closed her eyes, and counted to ten. Then she opened them and carefully reached into the cabinet under her desk, taking out a paper slip.\n“Alright—\nJerome—\nlet me remind you of your circumstances a bit,” she said, glaring at the freshly-trucked in 18-year old over the slip. She began reading it.\n“Jerome Smith, age 18, no notable achievements in life.”\n“Well, I was quite young you know, I didn't have the time!”\n“Don’t interrupt me—I’m getting there.” Solara channeled some divine energy into her glare, and the arrogant boy finally shrunk down a bit. She continued reading the paper, voice a glacier. “Cause of death: Attempted to read all 2000 chapters of the webnovel\n'Begone Jade Beauties, This Lord Only Wishes to Defy the Heavens',\nin one sitting. Died of malnutrition, dehydration, and exhaustion.”\nShe looked over the paper at the suddenly very-silent youth. “What exactly in\nthis\ngives reason to hand you boons? Those are not given for free you know.”\nThe boy hesitantly raised a finger. “Well—I can—”\nSuddenly, Solara felt an alarm bell hit her senses, as something suddenly felt\nvery wrong\n. She stood up, and silenced the kid with a gesture. “Please wait a minute there, it appears something has come up, and I must resolve an issue.”\nWith no further hesitation, she left the kid there, activated her [Divine Grand Teleportation That Goes A Really Big Distance], targeting it to Planet Dirt in the Munira realm.\nA portal opened, and she stepped through the universe.\n—\nAnd arrived in a hellscape.\nShe looked at the burning and crushed landscape below her—what had\nused\nto be planet Dirt. Her headache grew.\n“No no no… This can’t be happening. I was here only two days ago, and now the whole planet has been destroyed!”\nShe cast out her senses, searching for even one living being that would be able to give her an explanation, and found none.\nUntil her senses found their way to the very center of the planet, where she finally found a response. Something was there. Something powerful, big, and something which seemed to stretch over the whole burning hellscape. It was sitting there, dull and silent, slowly expanding and assimilating the shell of a planet around it.\n“A new [Planet]?” She looked curiously at the ground, wondering what had transpired here.\nShe cast out her divine sense further down and formed a mental connection with the being.\n“Hello, excuse me, can you explain what has happened here?”\nSolara could sense the being listening to her, but it did not respond. The only reply she got back was silence.\n“Hey, you’re in charge here right?”\nAgain, no response. Solara really began wishing she had her cup of coffee right about now.\n“Look, I know you might be new to this, but things have to be arranged! A [Hero] is scheduled to be sent here you know, and I need at least three demon lords for him to go up against! You can’t just… leave it like this!”\nShe gestured at the burning and shattered hellscape around her, a world too far gone from even the worst of a [Demon Lord's] plots.\nBut she got no response.\nShe glared at the ground, then kicked the molten lava and roiling earth she was standing on with her foot, cursing. “Fine then. I’ll just leave you here then, I’m sure I can arrange a time acceleration field of some sort. You better have some demon lords here within a few hundred thousand years!”\nSolara shook her head at the lack of a response, then began rechanneling her teleportation spell, already dreading the meetings and paperwork she would have to go through to explain\nthis.\nJust as she was about to be done with the spell, she remembered an irritating detail, and looked down one more time.\n“Hey, can I at least get your name? I need it for the paperwork. Can’t exactly have a [Planet] with no name can we? Ignore me, and I'll pick it myself. I won't be kind.”\nFinally, she sensed some sort of response. Not words exactly, but she could parse the meaning well enough. Her brows furrowed. “What do you mean you don’t have a name? You have to have\nsomething\nI can call you by!”\nAgain she received a response, and her headache got twice as bad. She finished the teleportation spell, and appeared back inside her office, right at her desk.\nAt least the annoying boy was gone, probably off to check the other counters. Solara slumped down on her table, trying to think of how she could spin this.\n\"Um, excuse me miss, they told me to come here and—\"\nSolara lifted her head and saw that a mouse of a girl had wandered over to her desk, and now stood in front, glancing around nervously.\nThe goddess instantly gathered herself into some vague resemblance of a professional, godly bearing, and nodded at her. \"Right, a new arrival then. Name?\"\n\"Rihito.\"\n\"Alright, give me just a second and I'll look over your file—\" Solara said, opening a cupboard and drawing a freshly [Created] slip of paper from there. She began looking it over. \"Hmm, [Novice Bard], alright for your age, cause of death: received\nhow much damage?!\n\"\nShe shouted out the last bit, looking between the paper and the girl who had frozen stiff. Then she looked at the achievements listed. She instantly straightened her back and fixed her face to her best customer service smile. \"Ah, sorry I didn't know you were one of our Premium Reincarnation Package beneficiaries, apologies for any rudeness.\"\nThe girl just looked more nervous, shrinking back. \"Reincarnation... So it really is a thing? The others were talking... do I have to do that? Go fight and stuff?\"\nSolara used a hint of her divine essence to cast [Calming Presence] and the girl's frightened bearing faded. \"Don't worry, the earthlings tend to get like that. They don't really understand like people from your world.\" Solara said, voice calming and reassuring, like a blanket by a fireplace. \"With the boons you are eligible for... you will have a lot of choices. You won't be forced into anything\"\nThe girl gave a nervous smile \"Ah, good. I just want to play some more music, really. I think I figured out something just before I... well, you know.\"\nSolara thought for a moment, then gestured to the side. \"Why don't you head right over to our Cozy Isekai counter and look over the options there? I think you'll find something quite fitting.\"\nThe young bard bowed. \"Thank you miss, really.\"\nSolara nodded. \"Good luck.\"\nRihito rose up, beginning to leave, then hesitated for a moment. She turned her head back. \"By the way, miss Goddess... are you alright? You seem troubled.\"\nSolara activated her [Divine Eyes of Seeing Almost But Not Quite Everything] and looked herself over. Her eyes were those of a dead fish.\nThe minor goddess slumped down to the table, sighing long.\n“Well, it's just some name trouble, for a new planet.\" She looked up at the girl, thinking. Bard-types were good at names and sounds, right?\n\"Girl, do you have any idea how I’m supposed to pronounce 🗿?”",

      "content": "On a certain mountaintop, high above the clouds, a hero and a villain were having a grand battle.\nOr about to—it hadn’t started quite yet. First, one had to have time for\nmonologues\nand such. Can’t really be a proper final battle without those.\nAnd so it was, that Jerome the level 60 [Hero] stared a villain in the eyes, and shivered.\n“What did you just say?” He asked, still reeling from disbelief at what he had just heard.\nThe villain, a red-skinned demon of orange jade with a red ruby mustache laughed, glintstone eyes glittering at his panic. “Do I really need to repeat myself?” The demon gestured at himself boisterously. “I used the same teabag to make 666 cups of tea, and gained the power of [Infinite Tea], becoming the [Infini-tea Demon]!”\nJerome blinked his eyes and gripped his sword harder. “You can’t be serious.”\nThe villain looked at him coldly, all the humor gone out of him in an instant. “Oh—I am\ndeadly\nserious.” He reached into his breast pouch, taking out a small bag that smelled of crystalline herbs. “Using my [Infinite Tea Technique], I will drop this bag of tea into the ocean, and convert all of the world’s water into tea!”\nJerome remained calm and readied his sword. “I won’t let that happen, because I am a [Hero]! Taste this! [Overwhelming Sword Attack of a Reasonable Amount of Destruction]!”\nThe demon sneered and launched his own torrent of mana at him. “I think not! [Abyss of Infinite Tea]!”\nJerome smirked, having fooled another demon with his fake sword. It was a handy trick, because most enemies always expected a [Hero] to fight with a blade in hand, but Jerome was different.\nJerome was\nspecial\n.\nHe wasn’t like any of the other [Heroes]. He had come to this world without any special boons or cheat abilities and had been forced to fight his way forward with nothing but grit and his own ironclad will. And he had succeeded, becoming the greatest [Hero] in the land.\nBecause… he actually did have a little advantage. Just a dash of cleverness and improvisation in the right skill set, and you could make all the difference in the world.\nSee, Jerome actually\nremembered\nsome things from his high school physics and chemistry classes. He sort-of knew that water was made of something like molecules, and had like…\nlittle bonds\nin there. Or something like that.\nUsing that knowledge, he had naturally been able to surpass all of the expert [Gemstone Mages] of this world and created an overpowered water magic technique.\nA technique that he now unleashed on the unsuspecting demon.\n“Fool, you fell for my trap! [Water Beam That is Actually Made of Like Molecules and Stuff]!”\nA gigantic beam of water roared out of his hands, and struck the demon’s beam of tea, creating a thunderous clash in the center, where tea fought against water.\nJets and sprays of liquid were sent all over the landscape, carving through the clouds below, and shattering the rocky mountaintop.\nTo Jerome’s dismay, the demon just laughed at his beam. “Hah, you think this technique can defeat me? The power of the atom is finite, while the power of tea is\ninfinite\n.”\nThe beam of tea started encroaching forward, slowly but surely winning against Jerome’s beam. More sprays were sent all over the landscape, and rocks were sent flying into the air.\nJerome panicked, trying to visualize the atoms and bonds and stuff in the water, because for some reason that made his magic stronger.\nThen—suddenly, out of nowhere—a small rock fell from the sky and hit the demon in the face.\nBONK\nJerome blinked.\nThe demon’s beam of tea winked out, just for a second.\nAnd Jerome’s beam of water struck the villain at his core, vaporizing him at the spot, and sending the small pebble that had given the assist careening off to the side.\nJerome stared at the corpse, the only remnants of the villain being the stylish leather boots he had left behind. Even now, after spending over two years in this world, the sight of death still sent him just a bit off-balance.\nContract Progressed!\n2/3 [Demon Lords] defeated!\nLevel up!\n500 100 / 500 000 xp\nDiscarding overflow xp\nYou have reached level 61!\nStats up!\nStrength (STR)\n: 261 -> 263\nDexterity (DEX)\n: 261 -> 263\nIntelligence (INT)\n: 560 -> 564\nHP:\n100 -> 104\nSeeing the numbers go up instantly calmed his psyche, even if he grimaced a bit at the wasted 100 xp. That one time he had wasted a whole 2000 experience still haunted him and made him shudder at night.\nBut then he grinned. “Thank the goddess, now the world is saved again.”\nAnd then he looked over the world, from high up on the mountaintop, truly loving it from the bottom of his heart. It was why he fought so hard to defend it.\nBecause this world was beautiful.\nIn the sky, he could make out the three brilliant rings that circled the planet, dancing their eternal waltz to the song. Because in this world, there was always a song. The gemstone trees sang in the wind, their bell-like leaves creating a soft melody as the gale went through them.\nAnd of course… the people. His friends and companions back at the village, saved now from the demon threat.\nAt first, Jerome had felt wary of their strange ways. A beautiful people, like living Jade statues, even if they had their quirks. He had been rather shocked to find out that none of them had anything between their legs. And that they seemed to be permanently stuck in the stone age. But he had adjusted.\nMaybe with this demon defeat, he would even find the bravery to finally ask one of those jade beauties out on a date...\nSo Jerome began walking down the mountain, humming along with the song of trees, satisfied that he had done a good job today.\nOverlooking the true hero.\nAlas, see how easily the [Hero] forgets! Forgets the true key to his victory and takes all the glory as his own!\nFor the small were often easily forgotten. Especially those who provide a last-minute assist in the final battle! Especially those as small as a… pebble.\nBut even if the [Hero] did, the world did not forget.\nThe world did not watch the champion from another walk down the mountain, but rather followed the real hero, the humble stone, which was rolling down the mountainside, making good speed by now.\nIt was a nice stone. A gneiss stone in fact. Accelerating. A level 1 [Rolling Stone].\nA brand-new hero, setting out on a grand quest.\nYes, the old [Planet] had retired from adventure and stored their old tools in the basement.\nBut… was there not a twinkle in their eye, as the veteran stowed their sword in a chest, letting the hilt peek outside just a bit?\nIt knew the youngster upstairs would eventually find it, grasp at the offered chance, and set out for adventure. Because the old one no longer could do it just by itself.\nPerhaps the young hero thought it was master of its own fate, but who had really given that first push forward?\nBecause… the old one really wanted to see it. What that young hero would do, and most importantly, what would happen at the end of the quest, which it had successfully transferred forward. Fulfilling all the requirements for transferring it had been difficult, but it had finally managed to replicate the conditions closely enough. And now it waited. What would the reward be? What would happen once the numbers finally reached their promised goal?\nIt might even occasionally place itself on the scales, helping the young hero along if it ever got stuck. Not too much of course, for no one could truly control a hero’s fate, and it did not want to rouse the system's ire further.\nBut it watched. Because watching those numbers go up, watching the rock grow bigger and more powerful, watching it grasp for that final goal as it struggled… it was just so\nsatisfying.\nAddicting. It had trod the path too long, it could not stop now. It had to pursuethat reward that was always staying beyond the next cliff, just out of reach.\nIt almost made the old one wish that the search would never end, that the adventure could continue forever. An eternity grasping for the finish line, but never\nquite\ngetting there.\nBut that would be dragging things out, and every story has its end. Even if the tale also begins anew.\nAshes to ashes. Dust to dust.\nRock to…\nPebble.\nQuest:\nCurrent Altitude\n: 9 662m\n[Unnamed]\nTitle(s)\n: Enemy of Demons\n🗿\nHP\n: 1/1\nMana\n: 0/0\nLevel\n: 1\nExperience\n: 0/20\nClass\n: Rolling Stone\nSub-class\n: None\nRace\n: Gneiss Stone\nGold\n: 0",
