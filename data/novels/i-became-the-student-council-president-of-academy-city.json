      "content": "‘I’ve been reincarnated.’\nWhen I grew enough to discern right from wrong in the arms of a nurturing robot, I realized that I had been reincarnated into the open-world game set in Academy City, which I had enjoyed for a long time. After enduring confusion for quite a while, I eventually accepted reality and adjusted my thinking.\n‘Since I’ve been given a second life… I should live happily.’\nThat was the conclusion I reached after years of contemplation. It was a very simple conclusion, but the process of reaching it was exceedingly long.\n‘To do that, I need to fulfill three conditions.’\nFor me to enjoy a happy life in this world.\n‘First, get a decent job.’\nThe prerequisite was good grades and an impressive school record.\n‘Second, eliminate the villains.’\nI didn’t have to worry about the villains from the original storyline. They could be left to the main character of the original story. The problem was the event villains who acted independently of the original storyline and threatened Academy City.\nVillains are entities that destroy the order of Academy City or the city itself. What happened when event villains were left unchecked in the game? They grew into an uncontrollable force and became Great Villains in Academy City.\nThe world outside Academy City is an apocalyptic one teeming with monsters. This is the only place where I can live peacefully. Therefore, I couldn’t just leave the villains alone.\n‘Third, marry my childhood friend.’\nMy childhood friend was the first beautiful girl in this world to become my ally. With her looks guaranteed to become stunning in the future and her sharp intellect, I resolved to become a man worthy of her.\n‘Great, perfect.’\nI could meet those three conditions by utilising my game knowledge and past life experience. This much was manageable.\nBut things never go as planned in life.\n“Woo-jin, you’re so pure. I hope you stay like this.”\nI was just pretending to be pure according to my age. But my childhood friend left those meaningful words and suddenly disappeared.\nWhere could she have gone? I searched everywhere, leaving no stone unturned, but I couldn’t even find a clue about her whereabouts. It was only after I reluctantly accepted that my only ally was gone that I realised my shoe soles were worn out like rags.\nReturning home, a deep sense of emptiness overwhelmed me. That feeling imprisoned me in my room for months.\nAnd then, years later, an unfamiliar letter arrived at my house.\n– To my friend Woo-jin\nIt was a letter from my childhood friend. The letter contained news that she had been recognized as a heinous criminal. The worst criminals in Academy City were called the ‘Five Sins,’ and with her addition, they became the ‘Six Sins.’ This was due to her continuously committing terrorist acts and building up a notorious reputation.\nThat’s when I realized who she was. She was one of the worst villains in the game, Kim Dalbi. The name she told me was a pseudonym.\nIt seemed that Kim Dalbi had planned this path even before she became friends with me.\n‘How absurd…’\nFor days, I couldn’t help but laugh helplessly.\n– Hello, Woo-jin. Congratulations on getting into Ahsung High School!\nI wanted to give you many things, but I thought you might feel uneasy no matter what gift I gave, so I just prepared some flowers. Will you accept them…? ㅠㅠ\nEven though I’ve become a piece of trash in this city… I’m always on your side. ^_^So, I hope you’ll accept this. I really, truly congratulate you.\nTake care in high school!\nOn the day I passed the high school entrance exam, a note was left in the house along with purple peony flowers. It was a congratulatory message from our notorious villain.\nI didn’t harbor any ill feelings. I was just thankful and put the peonies in a vase.\nThat day, I felt astonishingly peaceful. I became convinced that I could eliminate one of the three conditions for a happy life.\nIt seemed impossible to keep the fresh flowers for long. Eventually, I pressed them flat and carried them around as a talisman.\nTime flew by, and I became a second-year high school student. On a spring day when the chill had eased, I donned a black uniform and wore a red armband symbolizing the disciplinary committee on my left arm. Standing in front of the orderly students, I walked to the podium, slightly bowed my head, and adjusted my cap.\nBeep.\nWhen I touched the microphone, a feedback noise echoed. Drawing the attention of the disciplinary committee members to me, I spoke into the microphone.\n“Greetings. I am Ahn Woo-jin, a second-year student, and the 45th disciplinary committee leader.”\nIt was the appointment ceremony for the new leader of the disciplinary committee. It was now time for the next leader to present their aspirations. The red armband with a golden border on my left arm was the symbol of the disciplinary committee leader, which I inherited from the previous leader today.\nWith a tone of respect and solemnity, I said,\n“I won’t speak for long. All disturbances and illegal activities occurring within our jurisdiction, both inside and outside the school, will face the strictest sanctions and punishments ever. There will be no compromise. As the disciplinary committee leader, I promise to contribute more than ever to maintaining peace in the school.”\nThe disciplinary committee, the top in-school force, would eliminate villains ‘officially’ under my command. Since the committee’s activities also covered the surrounding areas outside the school, my school record would shine as a result.\nI had seized the opportunity for the two conditions set for a happy life to synergize and be fulfilled.\nOf course, this meant I would likely confront my childhood friend, Kim Dalbi. But I had already made up my mind. If left alone, she would become the worst villain, like a cancer, in Academy City.\nI had to stop her.\n“For the school, for the students, please fight alongside me. Thank you.”\nAs I bowed politely, hundreds of disciplinary committee members applauded. Today, I became the leader of Academy City’s disciplinary committee.",

      "content": "Rule 1. The leader does not arrive late (1)\nBeep, beep, the unpleasant alarm sound crushed the chirping of the birds outside the window.\nI rose from bed with precision and quickly turned off the alarm. It was a habitual action.\nOnce silence fell, I felt the urge to lie back down.\nSlap!\nA dry face wash, as good as a slap, quickly cut off the temptation.\n‘Get a grip. You have to go to school.’\nI had barely slept, studying late into the night.\nDuring the vacation, I had been appointed as the Disciplinary Committee Leader. It was clear that the workload would be heavy, leaving very little time for academics.\nHence, I had to thoroughly prepare during the break, enduring each day on minimal sleep.\nBut being late would be putting the cart before the horse.\nA Disciplinary Committee Leader, of all people, should adhere to school rules strictly!\n‘Oh, I’m so sleepy…’\nNo matter how much I pushed myself, the aftermath of the intense preparation during the break was strong.\nFatigue clung to me like a leech, refusing to let go.\nMy eyes naturally fell on the clock on my smartphone.\n‘…Just 5 more minutes should be okay.’\nAbsolutely.\nI should never have thought that.\nI lay down for a moment and blinked.\nForty-seven minutes had passed.\nI couldn’t believe my eyes.\n“…Ah.”\nMy hand automatically went to my forehead.\nThis was… a disaster.\n‘Aaaah…!’\nI hurriedly began preparing for school.\nI washed faster than anyone, changed into my uniform, grabbed my bag, and the official hat, which was part of our school’s attire, and rushed out of the house… only to come back.\nI grabbed my dried flower amulet. It was made from purple peonies. I had to carry it with me.\nI dashed out of the house again, putting on my hat as I ran through the streets.\n‘It takes an average of 35 minutes to get to school. Time left: 30 minutes and 45 seconds…!\nIf I shorten it by about 5 minutes by running, I can just barely avoid being late!’\nI calculated the time on my smartphone clock.\nI couldn’t afford to be late.\nToday was the start of the first semester of my second year. It was also my first day as the Disciplinary Committee Leader.\nIf I were late on such a day, I could already picture the consequences in my mind.\n‘The Disciplinary Committee Leader being late on the first day? How unreliable.’\n‘Why did they choose someone like that as the Leader…?’\n‘The Disciplinary Committee Leader should be a role model. To make such a mistake from the start…’\n‘The Leader broke the rules on the first day? Are they serious?’\nI could already hear the murmurs of my members like an auditory hallucination.\n‘I must not be late…! Especially not on the first day!’\nThe Disciplinary Committee of my high school, ‘Ahsung High School,’ was evaluated as the strongest among the committees of this academy city.\nOf course, this was merely a comprehensive assessment by analysts. Who knew what would happen if the committees clashed.\nAnyway, it was a fact that it was a strong group.\nBecause of that, Ahsung High’s Disciplinary Committee had a meritocratic culture.\nHowever, I was nothing more than an NPC or an extra in terms of game storyline importance.\nI had no innate talent.\nI was just a standout among the mediocre.\nThanks to utilizing game knowledge, I had been consistently repeating and mastering an efficient magic training method since a very young age.\n‘There are still many who feel doubtful about my role as the Disciplinary Committee Leader. Some even question my capabilities…!’\nI remembered this year’s Disciplinary Committee Leader from the game.\nThat guy was a third-rate villain who couldn’t become the Leader because of me, the new rising star.\nThat was one of the reasons I chose Ahsung High’s Disciplinary Committee.\nWhile other Leaders were exceptional, I thought I could at least surpass that third-rate guy. The timing was good.\nBut.\n‘There’s a risk of betrayal.’\nIn the game, members who doubted the third-rate Leader’s capabilities eventually betrayed him.\nThey pulled him down.\nThey thought they were superior in terms of capabilities.\nFrom the start, the members didn’t follow his orders properly, and morale was utterly shattered.\nI didn’t want to experience such things while I was the Leader.\n‘So, I need to be perfect.’\nEven if I wasn’t smart, I had to show good results while pretending to be relaxed and be called a genius.\nIf I didn’t follow the rules, I had to act as if I’d commit seppuku immediately.\nAs the Disciplinary Committee Leader of Ahsung High, I had to only show a charismatic side.\nOnly then would the nearly 400-strong group follow me properly.\nBut, being late on the first day of Leader activities?\nMy reputation.\nMy reputation as the Disciplinary Committee Leader would be tarnished from the start…!\n‘Alright, the train is here!’\nI arrived at the station and hurriedly boarded the train.\nMy destination was Ahsung High School, where I was enrolled.\nBut, even though the train had arrived promptly…\n‘Why is it so slow…. Please hurry up, please….’\nThe train moved as slowly as a snail. I felt like I was going to explode from frustration.\nSoon, the polite voice of the robotic conductor came over the announcement system.\n─ We are temporarily slowing the train to adjust the interval between this train and the one ahead. We ask for your understanding, dear passengers.\nWhat’s the train ahead doing!?\nAt this rate, the advantage of getting on the train immediately disappears.\n‘Should I just run?’\nWouldn’t it work if I strengthened my body with magic and sprinted all the way?\n‘No.’\nThe distance wasn’t exactly short.\nIt would be difficult to outrun the train to my destination.\n“Hmm?”\nAs I fidgeted, I suddenly saw a familiar face.\nIt was a mixed-race male student dressed in the white uniform of an elite school.\n‘Is that the protagonist?’\nSeventeen years since I reincarnated in this world, but that guy remained clearly etched in my memory.\nThe original protagonist, Lee Taesung.\nHe was happily chatting with the tsundere female student, the official heroine, enjoying a moment of youth.\nSince I became a high school freshman last year, the main scenario had been progressing in earnest.\nIt was convenient to grasp how things were unfolding since Lee Taesung and I were the same age.\nJust last year, his school had been attacked by a villain group, a mysterious black tower had suddenly risen, and all sorts of events had happened.\nSurely, he must have gained good fortune and diligently built up the affection of the heroines through various incidents. Not to mention, it’s not a monogamous game, so he would eventually marry all the heroines….\n‘Not that it matters to me.’\nFor some reason, probably because I had seen him in the game, I was interested in his movements.\nBut what good would it do for me to get involved?\nAfter all, Lee Taesung attended a different school.\nAs long as it didn’t cause any harm to me, I had no intention of intervening in the original scenario.\nStill, it seemed even the protagonist used public transportation when running late.\nWell, his school is nearby.\nIt must be the perfect time for him to head to school.\n“?”\nOur protagonist, Lee Taesung, glanced in my direction as if sensing my gaze.\nHe sure has an uncanny knack for noticing things like this. By now, his skills should be quite honed.\nI lowered my head, pulling down the brim of my hat to cover my eyes.\nNice to see you, but let’s not get involved.\nAt that moment.\nScreeeeech!!\n“Whoa!”\n“What the!?”\nSuddenly, the train came to an abrupt stop in the middle of the tracks.\nFortunately, it wasn’t moving fast, or we would have been thrown off balance by the dramatic halt. The students yelped in surprise.\n‘What’s going on!?’\nI was equally shocked.\nHad an accident occurred?\nSoon, all the train doors opened.\nStudents wearing combat uniforms over their school uniforms began to enter one by one.\n‘Crazy….’\nI knew exactly what was happening.\nThe other students, each wearing anxious expressions, seemed to understand as well.\nThud, thud. The armed students took positions in the center aisle.\n“Attention.”\nBang!\nA male student in a combat uniform, with a skull tattoo on his chin, slammed a long axe onto the floor, causing the students to flinch.\nThe doors closed, and the train started moving again.\n“From now on, this train is under our control. If you don’t do anything stupid, we won’t hurt you, so stay put.”\nHis tone was intimidating.\n‘Ah… right.’\nA fact that I had overlooked for 17 years came to mind. Just as juvenile detective Kim Jeon○ and famous detective Co○ encounter murder cases wherever they go, the protagonist brings about thrilling events wherever he goes.\n‘Aagh, gah…!’\nI felt like screaming.\nWhy…!\nWhy today, of all days!\nOh, heavens!!\n“What, what’s going on?”\n“Is it a villain…!?”\n“A dropout? Or an expelled student…?”\nThe students on the train were terrified.\nThough it might be a prejudice issue, dropouts and expelled students are often regarded with fear.\nThe villains committing these acts of terrorism were usually such people.\nEspecially in a city where academies were highly significant, the mindset of someone who dropped out or was expelled was unpredictable.\nNo wonder there were so many urban legends and webtoons or web novels featuring dropouts or expelled students as villains circulating on the internet.\n“That logo, it’s ‘Anomia’…!”\nA male student spoke with a trembling voice.\n‘Of course, it’s Anomia….’\nAnomia.\nA Greek word meaning the absence of God’s will and law.\nDespite their cringe-worthy name, they were one of the larger villain groups.\nThose who had taken over the train were part of Anomia’s forces.\nThese guys were particularly troublesome.\nTheir goal was to overthrow the academy city’s system and rules, creating a city where everyone was equal and free.\nThey were driven more by their beliefs than by practical considerations.\n“You there!”\n“!”\nThe tattooed male student roared with magical power, causing the students to flinch.\nHe approached a female student sitting down.\n“Were you trying to record a video just now?”\n“N-no! That’s not it…! Ah!”\nThe tattooed male student growled like a beast, roughly snatching the smartphone from the female student.\nThen, smash! He crushed it underfoot.\nThe female student began to tear up.\n“My phone….”\n“Listen up, all of you. As long as you stay quiet and behave, you won’t get hurt. But if anyone tries anything funny, next time it won’t be your phones getting smashed, but your heads!”\nThe tattooed male student threatened, roaring at the passengers.\nThe students’ faces were painted with anxiety.\nClunk, clunk!\n“Where are we going…?”\n“I’m scared….”\nThe students whispered among themselves.\nThe train suddenly changed its course and headed down an unfamiliar track.\nIt seemed Anomia had taken control of the cockpit as well.\nThey had likely subdued the driver and were operating the train themselves.\nMore importantly, this…\n‘I remember now. This is the train event….’\nI shut my eyes tight.\nI really wanted to cry.\nAlthough I had recorded and memorized my game knowledge, I couldn’t remember the exact date and time of every event.\nThis event… It happens today, on the first day of the second-year opening ceremony.\nSo, ultimately.\n‘I’m definitely going to be late….’\nWhile resigning myself to this, I imagined the relentless gossiping of the disciplinary committee members.\nThat the 45th Disciplinary Committee Leader was a fool who was late on the first day, a guy who breaks the rules himself, unfit to be a leader….\nThe reputation of Disciplinary Committee Leader Ahn Woo-jin was plummeting rapidly.\n‘…Let’s sort out my thoughts.’\nNo matter how much I regretted it, nothing would change.\nWhat’s done is done.\nI took a deep breath quietly, calming my emotions.\n‘What was the purpose of the train event again?’\nI racked my brain.\n‘…Kidnapping. Their target was a student on the train. Who was it again?’\nI couldn’t quite remember.\nWas it a freshman from a certain school?\nSince the train event wasn’t a major part of the game and was only mentioned, it was hard to recall.\nBut after racking my brain, I remembered something about the target.\nAnomia’s target usually commuted to school in a car with an escort.\nBut for some reason, the car broke down on the first day of high school. It was Anomia’s doing.\nSo she decided to take the train to experience the thrill of her first day of school.\nAnd that happened to be on this train.\n‘I remember that the Mafia valued her highly.’\nThe academy city’s Mafia… well, it was more like a group of young people playing house, but still.\nIt wasn’t an organization to be underestimated.\n‘Indeed, around this time, the Mafia and Anomia clashed, didn’t they? This situation was part of their conflict. But why did they occupy the train? …Ah, it was to avoid facing too many enemies.’\nIn the academy city, crime surveillance drone CCTVs constantly hovered in the sky, exchanging information with patrol robots roaming the streets.\nIf they tried to kidnap the target directly, they’d be caught by the drones first and then confronted by the patrol robots.\nEven if they managed to defeat the robots, next they’d have to deal with the police academy or the Disciplinary Committees of the local schools.\nKidnapping in the usual way without significant force was akin to a s*****e mission.\nHowever, if they kidnapped the target by hijacking a moving train, the issues Anomia worried about would be immediately resolved.\nOf course, if they didn’t achieve their goal quickly, they would eventually have to face the very enemies they were trying to avoid.\n“What are your intentions…?”\nOur righteous protagonist, Lee Taesung, stepped forward. He seemed to have decided to confront them out of sheer frustration.\nHis expression, tone, and words were all very protagonist-like.\nSwoosh.\n“Stay put. Or you’ll get hurt.”\nThe tattooed male student extended his axe threateningly under the protagonist’s chin.\nLee Taesung tilted his head back, frowning.\nThe axe blade was imbued with magic, the same dark purple as the wielder’s eyes.\nMagic influences the iris pigment, overlaying the owner’s eye color with its own.\n‘They’ll just have a little staring contest and be done with it.’\nHow could the protagonist’s group handle these guys?\nThe train event needed to progress a bit further before there’d be an opportunity to counterattack.\nStudents from the police academy, responsible for public places and remote areas, would rush to provide support.\nAnd a female student from the police academy would join as a heroine.\n“Grr…”\nThe protagonist, engaged in a staring contest, cautiously assessed the situation and then stepped back, frustration evident on his face.\n“Alright, I’ll let you off this time. But there won’t be a next.”\nThe tattooed male student mocked the retreating protagonist.\n‘Should I intervene?’\nI gripped the brim of my hat, pondering.\nThis was another school’s district. If I, as a Disciplinary Committee Leader, intervened without a justifiable reason, it could be considered interference, making post-event handling very troublesome.\nHowever, it seemed better to resolve this situation right now.\n‘Hmm?’\nI caught a glimpse of a familiar clock tower outside the window.\nIt was a structure that should be in the jurisdiction of Ahsung High School.\n‘Why am I seeing that already?’\nI quickly realized why.\nThe train had veered off onto a wrong track and was speeding along like a runaway train.\nWhich meant.\n‘This is our school’s jurisdiction?’\n…So, I didn’t have to worry about jurisdictional interference.\nSuddenly, a thought crossed my mind.\n‘Wait, this….’\nI couldn’t help but smile.\nMaybe I could make up for being late.\nI pulled down my hat and approached the tattooed male student.\n* * *\n“What are you?”\nThe tattooed male student looked at me with fierce eyes, adopting a defensive posture.\nA male student with his hat pulled down was approaching him.\nJudging by the black uniform, he was clearly from Ahsung High School.\nHe was Ahn Woo-jin.\nThe tattooed male student involuntarily flinched as Woo-jin’s sharp gaze bore into him.\nIt was the poker face Woo-jin had honed to exude the dignity of a Disciplinary Committee Leader, but the tattooed male student had no way of knowing that.\nThere was an inexplicable aura of intimidation emanating from Woo-jin.\nHe appeared to be on a different level.\nFeeling instinctive unease, the tattooed male student barely hid his agitation as he imbued his axe blade with magic.\n“Get lost! I’m sure I warned you!”\n“This is our jurisdiction from here on.”\n“What?”\nWoo-jin warned as he put on black gloves.\n“I’m executing on-site detention and will severely punish any lawbreakers.”\nIt was the official declaration issued by the Disciplinary Committee when apprehending offenders.\nHis voice was as firm as a judge pronouncing a verdict.\n“What are you saying, you bastard!”\nThe tattooed male student, feeling a primal sense of danger, swung his magic-imbued axe.\nHe had a gut feeling that if he didn’t deal with this guy immediately, things would get dangerous.\nWhoosh, Woo-jin twisted his body sideways.\nSlash!\nThe axe sliced through the air.\nAt an incredibly precise distance, the axe blade narrowly missed Woo-jin’s body, as if he had instinctively calculated its trajectory.\nSimultaneously, Woo-jin stomped hard on the tattooed male student’s right foot.\nCrack!\n“Ugh!”\nThe train floor dented under the force. A chilling sound of breaking bones accompanied the crushing of the combat boots.\nWoo-jin had used internal magic to strengthen his body. It was a skill anyone could use, but Woo-jin’s proficiency was on a different level than most students.\nThe tattooed male student felt intense pain.\nAt that moment, Woo-jin drew a black baton from his belt.\nWith a swift motion, he swung it downward.\nSnap!\nWith a crisp sound, the baton extended into its full length, forming a truncheon.\nIt was a telescopic baton.\nWoo-jin’s magic converted into a cyan electric current, infusing the baton’s magical circuit.\nHe swung the baton with immense force.\nBoom!\nCrackle!\n“Ugh!”\nThe sound of the strike was almost unbelievable for a baton.\nIt was more like an explosion.\nThe heavy blow sent the tattooed male student flying toward the train door.\nAs the cyan electricity from the baton surged through the tattooed male student’s body, it caused severe electrocution before dissipating into the air.\nThud! The tattooed male student crashed into the door.\n“Ugh…”\nHe clung to consciousness by a thread.\nIf he hadn’t reflexively channeled magic into his combat suit and skin to enhance his defense, he would have been knocked out instantly.\nHis arm and rib bones were fractured.\nHis entire body trembled from the electric currents coursing through it.\nThe tattooed male student couldn’t comprehend what had just happened.\nThe other students on the train were equally stunned, unable to process what they had seen and heard.\nIt had all happened so quickly.\n“Senior!”\n“You crazy bastard!”\nOther Anomia members shouted.\nTheir comrades from the adjacent car, having sensed the commotion, entered and took up fighting stances against Woo-jin.\nBut Woo-jin was unfazed.\nHe acted as if they were nothing.\nLike insignificant insects.\nWith his eyes shaded by the brim of his hat, Woo-jin’s cyan eyes coolly surveyed the enemies.\n“What… what are you?”\nThe tattooed male student gritted his teeth and managed to stand.\n“Executing arrests, severe punishment… Who the hell do you think you are to say that!?”\n‘Ah.’\nWoo-jin realized.\nIn his haste, he hadn’t put on his armband.\nIt was necessary to visibly display his authority to arrest and detain.\nLike how one wouldn’t question a police officer in uniform about their right to make an arrest.\nSwoosh.\nWoo-jin pulled out a red armband with a gold border from his pocket and fastened it to his left arm.\nThe red armband of the Disciplinary Committee.\nIt was a visible sign that he was on official duty.\nThe gold border symbolized his rank as the leader.\nThe Anomia members were all shocked upon seeing the armband.\n“Disciplinary Committee.”\nWoo-jin tapped the armband with his finger as he answered.",

      "content": "Chapter 2 – Rule 1. The leader does not arrive late (2)\nAhn Woo-jin thought to himself.\nIt would be enough to claim that being late was unavoidable due to resolving an important incident.\nThe reason he got on the train late.\nIf he hinted that he had anticipated Anomia’s plan in advance, the story would fall perfectly into place.\nSo Woo-jin intended to observe the situation and then say, “I knew all about your plans.”\nMeanwhile, the tattooed male student was wide-eyed.\n“A disciplinary committee armband…?”\nOf course, the disciplinary committee was one of the groups that required strict caution.\nThey were a militant group responsible for cracking down on illegal activities in their respective school districts.\nTherefore, Anomia was well aware of the form of the armband.\n“Crazy, that guy… is the Disciplinary Committee Leader of Ahsung High…?”\nThe armband Woo-jin wore was that of the Disciplinary Committee Leader.\nThe tattooed male student couldn’t close his mouth.\n‘No wonder he looked familiar…! I saw his face in the documents!’\nHe didn’t recognize him immediately because Woo-jin was wearing a hat.\nThe new Disciplinary Committee Leader of Ahsung High School, Ahn Woo-jin.\nOne of the strong ones who collected information thoroughly and devised meticulous strategies, making it hard to guarantee a win against him.\n‘Why is the Disciplinary Committee Leader here…?’\nThe tattooed male student harbored doubts.\n“Ahsung High’s Disciplinary Committee Leader? Why is that guy here?”\n“We already figured out that he’s always the first to arrive at school…”\n“There’s no reason for him to be here, right? If this guy from Ahsung High is here, he’d definitely be late…!”\nAnomia members whispered in confusion.\nNaturally, a strong sense of doubt arose.\nThe new Disciplinary Committee Leader of Ahsung High School, Ahn Woo-jin, had been a model student who never missed a single day of being the first to arrive at school since his first year. Anomia already had that information.\nIf an Ahsung High student was here now, it meant he would inevitably be late.\nBut why was the Disciplinary Committee Leader, who had never once been late, the exemplary student who had never shown even a hint of deviation, here on this train at this time today?\n“There’s no way that guy would be late… Ah!”\nThey simultaneously deduced the same conclusion.\nThere was only one conclusion that made sense.\n“Could it be, he noticed our plan…?”\n“Did we already fall into that guy’s palm…!?”\nThat was it.\nThere was no other explanation for why the Disciplinary Committee Leader of Ahsung High was here.\nThey had taken extreme measures to ensure no information leaked.\nThey couldn’t even guess how the information had been leaked.\nHow terrifying this man was.\n“…?”\nWoo-jin was taken aback but didn’t show it.\nHe didn’t expect them to deduce on their own according to his thoughts.\nIt was better this way, as he didn’t have to waste words.\nNow he just had to proceed with the suppression.\nWoo-jin silently approached the remaining Anomia members.\nJudging by his gaming knowledge, he could handle this level of small fry on his own.\n“No way out! We have to fight!”\n“Get him now!”\n“Attack all at once!”\nRunning away was difficult on the speeding train.\nLike prey desperately trying to survive in front of a predator, Anomia members rushed at Woo-jin all at once.\n“Ugh!”\n“Argh!”\nThere was no contest.\nEvery time Woo-jin skillfully swung his extendable baton in a crescent arc, Anomia members writhed in pain or passed out.\nEven being hit directly with a metal bat wouldn’t have been this powerful.\nMoreover, the baton was imbued with lightning magic, so even if they barely withstood the attack, their whole body would end up electrocuted.\n“Aaaah!!”\nThe tattooed male student, thinking Woo-jin had let his guard down, mustered the last of his strength and charged at Woo-jin.\nSwish!\nThe magic-imbued axe sliced sharply through the air.\nWoo-jin easily dodged by tilting his upper body to the side.\nWhack!\n“Ugh!”\nThe tattooed male student was hit in the abdomen by Woo-jin’s baton and rolled on the floor again.\n“Ugh! Uurgh!”\nHe vomited the contents of his stomach and looked up at Woo-jin with incredulous eyes.\n‘We can’t beat him…’\nThe skill gap was significant.\nHe had thought that numbers would prevail, but Woo-jin was easily shattering that belief.\nIn the end, the tattooed male student reached his limit and fainted.\nThe clash continued.\nAnomia members fought bravely like Spartan soldiers.\nHowever, to the students present, it was merely a one-sided slaughter by Woo-jin.\nIncluding the original protagonist, Lee Taesung, all the students who had been waiting for an opportunity couldn’t even think of intervening and just swallowed dryly.\n***\nThe train returned to its original route, and all the Anomia members who had taken over the train were transported away, restrained in transport vehicles.\nIf our school’s disciplinary committee hadn’t helped, we would have been in serious trouble.\nNow, my subordinates will interrogate the Anomia members and dig into the case. They’ll handle it well.\n‘Anyway, Anomia won’t grow any further from here.’\nAnomia wouldn’t be able to expand its power anymore and would eventually collapse on its own.\nOf course, there was a chance that Anomia might revive if things went strangely.\nBut if there were any signs of that, I wouldn’t just sit back and watch.\n‘The mafia is a bigger problem.’\nOn the other hand, the mafia, which is in conflict with Anomia, would grow its power later and open the floodgates in the black market to become a ‘Great Villain.’\nHowever, I considered the mafia not as an elimination target but as something to be cautious of.\n‘They’ll collapse eventually too.’\nEven if the mafia became a Great Villain, they wouldn’t last long and would eventually fall apart. Since they were event villains, the reasons for their demise weren’t detailed. It was likely related to the sudden death of the next boss.\nSo, it was enough to monitor the whereabouts and actions of that next boss. Finding that guy first wasn’t urgent.\nAnyway, cases involving both Anomia and the mafia were matters that could be handled at my level.\n“Thank you for your hard work, leader.”\n“Take care of the rest. Good job.”\n“Yes, sir!”\nThe transport crew of Ahsung High’s disciplinary committee saluted me and left. Although we were second-year classmates, he respected me due to the hierarchical relationship imposed by our positions.\nIt still felt strange.\nBeing addressed formally by a classmate.\nWhile I was watching the back of my subordinate, lost in thought, a familiar voice rang in my ears.\n“Our leader, making a big impact from day one.”\nA soft, friendly voice.\nAnother member of the disciplinary committee had approached me without my noticing. I turned my head towards her.\nA female student with a red armband on her left arm and a sword at her waist came into view.\nThe armband had a silver border engraved on it.\nA symbol of the Vice-Leader.\n“How’s the site command?”\n“I came to see you for a moment.”\nOh Baek-seo.\nMy classmate, who became the senior administrative officer and Vice-Leader of the disciplinary committee this year.\nUpon receiving the report about the commotion on the train, she had led the committee members here. Though there was no need for the Vice-Leader to come in person, she said she came because she heard I was handling the suppression alone.\nOh Baek-seo was a talented person who showed outstanding abilities in various fields, had strong popularity, and even had excellent combat skills.\nBecause of this, Baek-seo was regarded as an object of admiration not only in the disciplinary committee but also throughout Ahsung High.\nWhy wasn’t such a person appointed as the Leader from the start? Because Baek-seo didn’t want it. The reason was that she felt burdened by it.\n‘I was really lucky that she didn’t want the Leader position….’\nOtherwise, I wouldn’t have even dreamed of becoming the disciplinary committee leader.\nAnyway.\nSince I knew Baek-seo’s intentions from the beginning, I never considered her a competitor for the Leader position.\nI just dealt with her with a relaxed mind.\nThis attitude made me appear as someone who could stay composed around Baek-seo, which earned me extra points for being recognized as Leader material, as I heard during a recent gathering.\n‘The problem is the perception of the committee members, though.’\nWhat would the members think?\nThey might find it hard to see a reason to follow me over Baek-seo.\nI would probably feel the same if I were a member.\nThus, Baek-seo was also the reason I had to strive to be more perfect as the Leader.\n“You know? If it weren’t for the Leader, things could have gotten much worse.”\nBaek-seo said in her usual gentle tone while examining the documents on the clipboard in her hand.\n“We couldn’t guarantee what kind of damage the many students on the train would have suffered, and there would have been considerable financial damage to the railway business as well. The train operation was completely halted. Our Leader has indebted several places at once. Good job.”\nA kindergarten teacher’s smile filled Baek-seo’s face, as if she was about to pat my head.\n“That’s a relief.”\nI responded calmly, gripping the brim of my hat.\nBaek-seo looked puzzled.\n“You speak as if it’s no big deal?”\n“I just did what I had to do.”\n“Really?”\nYes.\nI just did what I had to do.\nBaek-seo stared at me, stroking her chin, a fresh smile spreading across her face for some reason.\n“When I couldn’t see the Leader, I thought maybe you were late on your first day….”\n“That’s ridiculous. Do you think I would do something so undignified?”\n“Right. The Leader wouldn’t.”\nFor some reason, a bead of cold sweat trickled down my cheek.\n“Anyway, it’s impressive. I didn’t expect you to figure out Anomia’s plan in advance. I didn’t know at all. Couldn’t you have given me a hint?”\nI didn’t know either….\n“I wasn’t sure. And if the information that I knew their plan got out, it would be uncontrollable afterwards. I was being cautious.”\nI shrugged my shoulders, trying to sound as natural as possible.\n“Yeah…, I guess I need to become someone the Leader can trust soon.”\nBaek-seo shrugged her shoulders, mimicking my earlier action.\n“I’m not saying I don’t trust you.”\n“I know. I was talking about methodology.”\nBaek-seo looked at the train where the incident occurred.\n“Of course, you won’t be marked late. I’ll submit a justification, so just attend the opening ceremony. The first platoon will handle the site cleanup.”\n“Please do. Handle the case, and report any special matters.”\n“Got it, I will.”\nMy immediate role was over.\n“Then I’ll go back to commanding the site.”\nBaek-seo said and turned around, walking away.\nBut why was she going in the wrong direction?\nOh, probably to the restroom.\nAnyway…, it was finally over.\n‘Phewwww….’\nI let out a deep sigh of relief inside.\nBeing late was now an unavoidable matter.\nI had become the figure who had ‘anticipated Anomia’s plan in advance and suppressed them.’\nRather than tarnishing my image, I had successfully built up achievements from day one.\nHeaven must have had a plan.\nLooking up at the clear sky, I offered my thanks. Hey, I knew you had my back!\nAt that moment, Baek-seo suddenly stopped and turned around as if she remembered something.\nShe arrived in a blind spot where the disciplinary committee members, busy cleaning up the scene, couldn’t see her.\nBaek-seo’s kind smile was directed at me.\n“Leader.”\n“?\nBaek-seo gently called me and waved her hand.\n“Come here.”\nWhat’s this about?\nI squinted my eyes and walked over. Was she planning to play a prank on me before I left?\nAs soon as I stepped into the blind spot, Baek-seo’s hand reached for my head.\nShe straightened my hat, then loosened my tie and began retying it.\n“…What are you doing?”\n“It was slightly crooked. It was bothering me.”\nIt must have gotten messed up during the fight.\n“Thanks, but did you have to do it here?”\nIn such a secluded spot.\nBaek-seo looked into my eyes with a meaningful smile and whispered.\n“If others see us like this, they might mistake us for being a couple. Unless you want that.”\n“In that case, no thanks.”\nBaek-seo was right.\nWe, as members of the disciplinary committee, must strictly enforce the rules against improper conduct.\nEspecially since Ahsung High School had a rule against romantic relationships because they were seen as distractions from academics.\nAn awkward silence followed.\nDuring that time, Baek-seo’s soft hands skillfully tied my tie into a neat shape.\nI swallowed dryly.\nFor some reason, I felt tense.\nOver something like this.\nFinally, the tie was done.\n“All set.”\n“Thanks for the care.”\nBut she didn’t let go of my tie.\nDoes she have something to say?\n“…Baek-seo?”\n“We’re second-years now.”\nBaek-seo spoke in a gentle tone when I called her name.\n“That’s right.”\nBaek-seo let go of my tie and smiled brightly as she met my gaze.\n“Leader.”\n“?”\n“Let’s do well this year.”\nAll of a sudden?\n‘Oh.’\nCome to think of it, today was the first day we were officially starting our roles as leader and Vice-Leader.\nIt seemed like she was saying we should work well together.\n‘Sentimental as always….’\nThe corners of my mouth lifted slightly.\nThe proper response to such words was to reciprocate with similar sentiments.\n“You too. Let’s do our best.”\nI responded courteously and stepped back.\nI lowered my head to check and touch my tie.\nShe had tied it perfectly.\nAs expected from the talented Baek-seo.\n“Nicely done, for someone who doesn’t usually wear a tie.”\n“I practiced.”\n“Why?”\n“Who knows.”\n?\nBaek-seo smiled and left.\n…\nI arrived at school.\nSince I was already late, I decided to skip the ongoing opening ceremony and head straight to the disciplinary committee office.\nIn the office, a calligraphy piece with the slogan “For the Rejuvenation of Humanity” was hanging prominently.\n‘First, I need to apply for late exemption.’\nBaek-seo said she would handle it, but I didn’t want to burden her with even this task.\nAttendance was recorded electronically. I was already marked as late. So, I needed to submit a late-exemption application through the school’s website. The AI would then determine if the reason was legitimate and provide a decision.\n‘Hmm?’\n…Why is it already submitted?\nThe application status shows ‘under review’?\nI checked the submitted application.\n[ Late-Exemption Application ]\n─ Name: Ahn Woo-jin\n─ Reason: Due to handling an urgent matter as part of disciplinary committee activities, I was unavoidably late to school. Therefore, I seek to be acknowledged as having attended on time, in accordance with Article 32, Paragraph 6 of the school regulations. Attached is supporting documentation.\n─ Attached file: Disciplinary Committee Activity_Ahn Woo-jin_PNG [Download]\n─ Proxy: Disciplinary Committee Vice-Leader Oh Baek-seo\nBaek-seo had submitted it.\nThe application was submitted while I was busy restraining the Anomia members.\nThe attached file contained documentation of the incident.\n‘This is….’\nHeh.\nA chuckle escaped between my lips.\nOnce the application is processed, its contents become inaccessible. It should be done now that the opening ceremony is over.\nI canceled the submitted application and wrote a new one.\nI decided to keep this from the Vice-Leader.\nShould I appreciate how much she covered for me? I pondered for a while.\n* * *\n─ Se-Ah, are you alright?\n“Yes, I’m fine~.”\nLee Se-Ah, a tidy female student dressed in Ahsung High School’s black uniform, answered her smartphone with a hint of a smile.\nHer narrow eyes curved like a fox’s when she laughed.\n“The leader of our school’s disciplinary committee personally protected me. To think I would owe them a debt on the first day… This is quite troublesome!”\nSe-Ah spoke playfully.\nShe was the female student targeted by Anomia during the train incident.\nAlthough Anomia didn’t make it obvious, Se-Ah easily realized she was their target.\nDespite that, she remained carefree, acting as if nothing had happened.\n─ Se-Ah, please avoid commuting alone from now on. Anomia has identified you as a target. This time, the disciplinary committee leader from Ahsung High helped, but there’s no guarantee it won’t happen again.\n“Oh dear, that’s troublesome!”\n─ Please don’t be flippant…. This is serious.\nA sigh was heard from the smartphone.\n─ By the way, I didn’t expect Ahsung High’s disciplinary committee leader to have anticipated Anomia’s plan. We didn’t see it coming either.\n“Jung-mi, there’s something a bit strange about it, don’t you think?”\n─ What do you mean?\nSe-Ah chuckled mischievously.\n“You see, at first, I got on the wrong train and was late, right?”\n─ ……?\n“Anomia must have been stealthily tailing me and adjusted their movements accordingly. That’s how they were able to ambush the train I later transferred to, right? But the disciplinary committee leader was already on that exact train? How could that be?”\nSe-Ah tilted her head with a smiling face.\n“That person.”\nSuddenly, Se-Ah lowered her voice. Although she was still smiling, there was a seriousness in her tone.\n“They were monitoring Anomia’s movements in real-time.”\nAhn Woo-jin, the disciplinary committee leader, hadn’t just anticipated Anomia’s plan.\nHe had gone a step further.\nSe-Ah sensed a kind of tenacity from Ahn Woo-jin.\nIt was something beyond her reach.\n“In that case, what about other organizations?”\nIf he was like that with Anomia, how would he handle larger organizations?\n─ I understand what you mean now.\n“Wow~. No wonder he became the disciplinary committee leader over Oh Baek-seo. Truly terrifying.”\nSe-Ah returned to her playful tone.\nWhen she first decided to enroll at Ahsung High, she had little interest in the disciplinary committee leader.\nShe was only mildly curious that someone other than the famous Oh Baek-seo had become the leader.\nTo think it would be like this.\nSe-Ah grinned.\n“I’m starting to get a bit interested.”\nThus, on the first day at Ahsung High School, the new student Lee Se-Ah took her time, becoming the last student to arrive and marking her record with a tardiness.",

      "content": "Chapter 3 – Rule 2: The Leader Does Not Become a Freeloader (1)\nI enjoyed the morning air that seeped into my lungs, arriving at school faster than anyone else, unlike anyone else.\n*Squeak.*\nAs soon as I entered the vintage-style Disciplinary Committee Leader’s office, a mix of subtle tension and comfort washed over me. These two feelings seemed incompatible, yet they surprisingly blended well together.\n‘As expected, I’m the first to arrive.’\nCozy. Quiet.\nI turned on the lights, made myself a warm cup of coffee, and sat at my desk.\nSteam rose gently from the coffee cup, and the subtle aroma of coffee beans spread throughout the room. Holding the cup, I looked out the window and felt a certain charm in the scene.\nAs I have come to realize this year, I truly enjoyed this time of day. So, in the morning, I tried to savor this quiet and serene leisure.\nI took a sip of my coffee.\n*Sizzle!*\n“Ah, damn! So hot…!”\nI almost burned my mouth. I even spilled some coffee.\n“Phew.”\nI almost dropped the cup. That would have been disastrous.\n‘Did anyone see that…?’\nI quickly looked around. Thankfully, no one was there.\nMy earlier display was certainly unbecoming of the Disciplinary Committee Leader. I couldn’t allow myself to show such a clumsy side to others.\nI immediately wiped up the spilled coffee with a tissue, erasing all evidence. I had nearly shown an undignified side of myself.\nI sat back in my chair and resumed my leisurely morning as if nothing had happened.\n“Phew.”\nThe aroma of the coffee was truly delightful.\n“Good morning, Leader. Did you have breakfast?”\n“Gah…!”\nI almost choked on my coffee.\n*Gulp…*\nFortunately, I managed to swallow it.\nI turned my head toward the source of the voice by the door. A graceful female student with a sword at her waist entered the room with a gentle smile.\nIt was Oh Baek-seo, the vice-leader of the Disciplinary Committee.\n“Vice-leader, you’re here early. Good morning.”\n“Good morning.”\n“This is my breakfast. Just a cup of coffee is enough.”\n“Isn’t that too little? Even if it’s not a hearty meal, you should at least have some proper nutrients.”\nWhat is her timing? I didn’t hear any footsteps in the hallway.\n‘It’s as if she was hiding by the door and then appeared…’\nThough the thought was eerie, I quickly shook my head. Our gentle and innocent vice-leader couldn’t possibly do that.\n‘It must be my imagination.’\nI concluded that I just hadn’t been paying attention.\nBaek-seo sat gracefully on the sofa and placed a wrapped sandwich on the table.\n“Is that your breakfast?”\n“Yes, an egg mayo sandwich. Mmm.”\nBaek-seo took a bite of the sandwich and chewed it slowly.\nAm I just hungry? It looked like a convenience store sandwich, but it seemed strangely appetizing.\n“…Do you want some?”\nBaek-seo looked at me with big eyes and asked. The timing was so perfect that it was as if she had read my mind.\nAs if she had anticipated I might think this way.\n“It’s fine. I’m not eating.”\nBut no matter how appetizing it looked, I had no intention of asking for a bite.\n‘Being a “one-bite person” is beneath my dignity. As the Disciplinary Committee Leader, I must strictly avoid such behavior.’\nIt would certainly gnaw away at my dignity like a rat.\nMoreover, since Baek-seo was the vice-leader and the best talent in the Disciplinary Committee, akin to my right-hand person, I couldn’t show an undignified side to her.\n“You seemed like you wanted some. I can give you a bite if you eat the side I bit into.”\n“I said I don’t want any… And stop making weird jokes.”\n“Hehe.”\nBaek-seo laughed playfully. She must have suggested a shared bite knowing I’d refuse.\nIn the game, Baek-seo was a minor character with little screen time. So I wasn’t sure of her personality, but now I knew her quite well.\n“Anyway, as I said, I’m fine. This is enough for me.”\nI showed her my steaming coffee cup.\nRight now, I wanted to display the ‘Disciplinary Committee Leader, who exudes dignity even in moments of leisure.’\nI’ll just buy a sandwich later when no one’s around.\n“Really? Okay. Yum.”\nBaek-seo deliberately made a sound effect as she took another bite of her sandwich.\nI had planned to spend my morning leisurely. I didn’t expect Baek-seo to have breakfast here, which created an awkward atmosphere, so I started reading through the matters that needed review.\nAnd then it hit me.\n‘Wait a minute. This smell….’\nI had been so focused on savoring the aroma of my coffee that I missed it.\nAn unidentified, ferocious smell had filled the room.\nBaek-seo had brought an egg mayo sandwich made with boiled eggs and mayonnaise. However, this smell was not something that could come from a simple egg mayo sandwich.\nWhat was this violently appetizing smell?\nSoon, I realized.\n‘Grilled bacon…!’\nIt was the smell of bacon.\nThere was grilled bacon in the egg mayo sandwich?\nMy mouth watered, and my appetite started clamoring.\n‘Damn, I want to eat it…!’\nI wanted to ask for just one bite. I wanted to savor the fantastic synergy of finely chopped boiled eggs, creamy mayonnaise, and grilled bacon on my tongue…!\nA longing rose in my chest, and my eyes drifted to the clock.\n‘It’s still a while before the snack shop opens.’\nI couldn’t just run to the school snack shop. Who knew that being exemplary and arriving early would lead to such a mishap?\nIn the end, the only way was to ask Baek-seo for a bite.\n‘But… no.’\nNo matter what, asking for “just one bite” would damage the image I had painstakingly built.\nBaek-seo would surely let me have a bite. But as the Disciplinary Committee Leader, I couldn’t let myself be looked down upon, even slightly.\nSome might call me old-fashioned. Some might question what the big deal was.\nBut I was the Disciplinary Committee Leader, ranked number one in martial prowess, leading a force of about 400 members organized into ten platoons.\nMy role was to lead the committee in capturing villains, and for that, I needed to be someone the members could believe in and follow. I had to be a person who, if not perfect, was as dignified and nearly perfect as possible at this school.\nTherefore, I had to be strict with myself. I could not allow even a hint of carelessness.\nThat was respect for those who followed me. It was the responsibility required of a leader of a group. It was my duty.\nTherefore,\n‘I won’t ask for a bite…!’\nI wouldn’t scrounge for a bite of the bacon egg mayo sandwich. I would get through this situation without batting an eye.\nI would wait until Baek-seo finished the sandwich.\nJust then, I heard a thud.\nSomething was placed on my desk. I realized that I had been squeezing my eyes shut without even knowing it.\n“?”\nPretending that I was just rubbing my eyes from fatigue, I cautiously opened them.\nA lunchbox was on my desk. Beyond it, Baek-seo was smiling at me.\n“Are you tired, Leader?”\n“I haven’t been sleeping well because of recent work. But what’s this? Did you recover a lost explosive or something?”\n“It’s a lunchbox, as you can see.”\nA lunchbox? Suddenly? Why?\n“Open it.”\nWhen I opened the lid, I saw two neatly made egg mayo sandwiches and a fresh salad drizzled with dressing.\nThe lunchbox was so aesthetically pleasing that I immediately thought it looked pretty.\nBut I couldn’t understand why she was giving this to me. I gave her a questioning look, and Baek-seo began to explain.\n“I made it for lunch, but… I’m kind of tired of it. Would you eat it for me? Otherwise, I’ll have to throw it away.”\nMy goodness.\n“Because of the sandwich you just ate?”\nBaek-seo nodded nonchalantly.\n“You might change your mind by lunchtime.”\n“No, I just thought of something else I want to eat.”\n“Hmm, okay… In that case, it can’t be helped. Throwing away perfectly good food is inappropriate.”\nThat’s right. Borrowing a bite from someone else’s food isn’t good for my image, but in this case, it should be fine.\nReflexively, my mouth watered. The sandwich Baek-seo had eaten from the convenience store paled in comparison to this one.\nEven the grilled bacon sticking out looked incredibly tempting, clearly made with care.\n“Thanks. I’ll enjoy this.”\nI picked up one of the sandwiches and took a bite.\n‘Wow…!’\nThe soft texture of the bread.\nFollowed by the gentle chew of boiled egg pieces and the rich taste of the mayonnaise creating a fantastic flavor. Meanwhile, the grilled bacon added a chewy texture and a subtle saltiness, creating an amazing synergy.\n“!”\nAnd then, a surprise appearance of sweet chili sauce enhanced the umami flavor.\nCombined with the bitterness of the coffee, a delightful harmony filled my mouth.\nI devoured the sandwich so quickly that it disappeared in an instant.\n“Leader, is it good?”\nBefore I knew it, Baek-seo was standing close to me, leaning on the desk.\nUndoubtedly, it tasted incredible.\nWithout showing any excitement, I calmly gave the highest praise.\n“Could you share the recipe? I’d like to make it myself next time.”\nIt was so delicious that I wanted to eat it again later. Hence, I asked for the recipe.\nHowever, Baek-seo shook her head.\n“I can’t do that. I won’t tell you.”\n“Why?”\n“If you want, I’ll make it for you again next time.”\nReally?\n“Isn’t that troublesome? There’s no need for that.”\nThat would make me feel guilty.\nBaek-seo waved her hand dismissively with a smiling face, indicating not to worry.\n“I like cooking. It’s good for me if you give me an excuse to cook.”\nAh.\nIf that’s the case…\n“When you put it that way… thank you.”\nBaek-seo smiled contentedly.\n“Enjoy your meal.”\nBaek-seo got off the desk and headed toward the door.\n“Going to class?”\n“Yes, we have classroom lessons for first period.”\n“Take care.”\nBaek-seo waved lightly as she left the Disciplinary Committee office.\n“Wow….”\nLeft alone in the room, I finally let out the exclamation I had been holding back.\nThis sandwich was incredibly delicious.\nI was almost tempted to consider Baek-seo as a potential bride candidate.\n…It would be rude to have such thoughts without considering the other person’s feelings.\nI suddenly remembered the peony flower talisman in my pocket, feeling a pang in my chest. But I brushed it off as it was an emotion akin to a burnt-out ember.\nAnyway.\n‘Why is this so delicious? Is there something different about the ingredients?’\nI wanted to examine the ingredients closely, so I lifted the bread. The ingredients looked ordinary at first glance.\n“Hmm?”\nAs I was about to close the sandwich, I noticed something strange.\nChilli sauce was smeared on the inside of the bread. Given the light color of the egg mayo sandwich, the chilli sauce stood out.\nHowever, the shape of the smear was peculiar.\n‘A heart?’\nFor some reason, the chilli sauce was shaped like a heart. It was too precise to be a coincidence.\nIt would have been nice to compare it with the other sandwich, but that one was already chewed up and in my stomach, making it impossible to verify.\n“…….”\nA strange thought crossed my mind, but I quickly shook it off.\nBaek-seo had said she brought it for herself. There’s no way she made it specifically for me. That would be an over-interpretation.\nBesides, if I had just eaten the sandwich, I wouldn’t have noticed the heart shape.\n‘She probably just likes heart shapes and did it for fun.’\nIt’s common for girls to like hearts.\nI almost misunderstood something.\nAnyway.\nI finished the remaining sandwich and salad, leaning back in my chair, savoring the lingering taste.\n‘That was delicious….’\nThat day, perhaps because I had breakfast, I felt great. From tomorrow on, I won’t skip breakfast.",

      "content": "Chapter 4 – Rule 3: The Leader cares about new students\nEvery morning, a solemn atmosphere pervades the gates of Ahsung High School.\nThis is due to the disciplinary committee members standing by the gates, holding clipboards, during school hours.\nUnder the clear spring sky, cherry blossoms flutter around the first gate of Ahsung High School. Six disciplinary committee members, each wearing armbands, stood in their respective positions.\nThey scrutinize the students passing through the gate.\n“Hold on there!”\n“Me?”\n“Wearing gym shorts under your skirt is a clear violation of school regulations. State your affiliation and grade.”\n“Oh, oops, I forgot. Can’t I just take them off?”\n“Of course, but since you’ve already violated the rules, you’ll receive demerit points.”\n“Geez, that’s so petty….”\nThe girl grumbled, revealing her affiliation and grade to the committee member before leaving.\nEvery morning at Ahsung High’s four gates, hair and uniform inspections are conducted. The disciplinary committee members take turns overseeing each gate.\nNaturally, the process isn’t always smooth.\n“Hey! Where’s your school cap and name tag?”\n“The cap’s in my bag, but I forgot the name tag…. Can’t you just let this one slide?”\n“No, state your affiliation, grade, and name.”\n“Just this once, please. I left my name tag in the classroom by mistake. I’ll wear it as soon as I get there.”\n“No exceptions. Now hurry up and tell me.”\n“Ugh, seriously. A first-year being this inflexible….”\n“What was that…?”\n“Hey, freshman. If you keep this uptight attitude, don’t you think it’ll suffocate the students….”\nAt that moment, a dark shadow loomed over the boy grumbling at the committee member.\nSensing the ominous presence, the boy immediately fell silent. His survival instinct screamed at him to shut up.\n“Disciplinary Committee Leader….”\nThe first-year committee member’s voice trembled.\nAt Ahsung High, Ahn Woo-jin, the Disciplinary Committee Leader, stood behind the boy, exuding a chilling aura.\nWoo-jin’s authority as the leader was supreme, and his personality was extremely strict and decisive. There was even an incredible story about how he single-handedly subdued an armed group that hijacked a subway on his first day as the committee leader.\nHe was practically a monster.\n“I-I…”\nThe boy couldn’t imagine how his school life would be if he displeased Woo-jin.\nTerrified, the boy glanced at Woo-jin’s menacing eyes and quickly lowered his head.\n“Disgraceful.”\nWoo-jin’s icy voice made the boy shudder.\n“Affiliation, grade, and name.”\n“Kukwha House, 2nd year, Cho Mansoo…!”\n“Record it.”\nAt Woo-jin’s command, the committee member sharply replied, “Yes!” and recorded ‘Cho Mansoo, Kukwha House, 2nd year’ in the log.\n“Cho Mansoo.”\n“Yes…!”\n“Abide by the school rules strictly. And.”\nWoo-jin solemnly looked down at Mansoo, who couldn’t meet his eyes.\n“If you display the same behavior to our members again, next time it won’t just be demerit points.”\nWoo-jin’s sneer sent a chill down Mansoo’s spine.\n“S-Sorry…. Excuse me….”\nMansoo quickly bowed and scurried away.\nThe committee member watched Mansoo leave while Woo-jin clicked his tongue.\nThe committee member then looked at Woo-jin with admiration.\n“Thank you, sir…!”\nDisciplinary Committee Leader Ahn Woo-jin.\nDespite being just a year older than the new committee member, he seemed like someone from an entirely different world.\nHe was mature, handsome, strong, one of the top students in his grade, and overflowing with charisma. He was the most perfect person the committee member had ever seen.\n“Good job.”\n“Huh?”\nThe committee member was surprised. He didn’t expect Woo-jin to offer encouragement.\nWoo-jin grabbed the brim of his cap, his turquoise eyes shining under the shadow of the brim.\n“Guys like that show up quite often. They know the committee members can’t cross certain lines, and if the other person is a junior, a bit of intimidation usually makes them back off. Plus, you’re a new first-year member, so you must seem even easier to them.”\n“I see….”\nAs he spoke, Woo-jin felt a strange sense of discomfort.\n‘Wait a minute. Isn’t this too obvious?’\nSeeing the new member dealing with a troublesome student made him want to teach them more, like an experienced gamer guiding a newbie.\nHe felt a bit of frustration.\n“Ahem.”\nWoo-jin cleared his throat lightly, thinking it was best to end the conversation here.\nA faint, awkward smile crossed his lips.\n“Anyway, you’ll get better with time. Hang in there.”\n“……!”\nThe committee member saw it. The slight curl of Woo-jin’s lips, which usually held nothing but coldness.\nThat subtle warmth moved the committee member’s heart.\n“Sir, I’ll do my best…!”\nSuddenly filled with determination, the committee member saluted sharply, his voice brimming with passion.\n“Oh? Oh, alright….”\nWoo-jin nodded and left the scene, unaware that he had just become a role model for the new committee member.\n* * *\nWoo-jin had checked on the new members because he was concerned about them. The troublesome students were still up to their usual antics, but it was a relief to see the new members brimming with energy.\n‘I need to treat them well. They’re the ones who’ll help me catch the villains.’\nNot only did he need to maintain his charisma and authority, but he also had to make it clear that he cared about each member. It was all for his own goals.\nIn the year he became the disciplinary committee leader, the application rate for the committee had reached an all-time high.\nIt was always high since serving on the committee was important for school records, but the sudden spike in applications was due to the increased number of students who had heard of his reputation. He wasn’t sure what the rumors were, but it seemed his efforts to build a good image had paid off.\nThis increased the chances of selecting even one more good talent, so he got actively involved in the recruitment process.\nTo catch villains, he needed to select capable individuals.\nAt the time, the personnel in charge of recruitment were overwhelmed with work. They had dark circles under their eyes and looked like zombies.\n‘You’re going to review all these? Sir?’\n‘There’s no need! We can handle it somehow! We’ve only had four sleepless nights! Energy drinks will keep us going!’\n‘You’re taking over…! Doing this much for us…?’\n‘Sir, I’ll follow you forever…!’\nHe thought they’d be uncomfortable if he helped, even prepared for them to dislike it. But instead, they were moved to tears.\nHe still didn’t understand what they meant by following him forever since he only had a year as the leader.\nRegardless, he diligently narrowed down the list to the most promising candidates.\nHe focused on indicators of physical strength. To catch villains, strong members were crucial. Additionally, the stronger the disciplinary committee, the greater his authority would be.\n‘It was quite tough….’\nThe sheer number of applicants made the task much harder than expected, to the point where he regretted taking it on.\nLater, the vice leader offered to help, and her lightning-fast work pace was a huge relief.\nWithout her, he might have been buried under paperwork.\n“Do you have something to say?”\n“!”\nIn the disciplinary committee office, while reminiscing about the past at his desk, he looked at Oh Baek-seo, who was reviewing documents on the couch.\nBaek-seo, seemingly with eyes on the back of her head, asked without turning around.\nShe turned to him with her usual gentle smile.\n“No, I was just looking. But how did you know I was watching you?”\n“Want to guess?”\n“…There’s a mirror.”\n“Correct.”\nA small mirror was on the table in front of Baek-seo, hidden by her body until now.\n‘I thought she was just looking at the documents….’\nWas she sneakily watching him through the mirror?\n…Nah, that’s probably just my imagination.\nShe must’ve just noticed by chance.\nSuddenly, Baek-seo moved to the opposite couch, facing him.\n“Why did you change seats?”\n“You seemed to want to see my face. It’s easier to see me here, right?”\nThat playful smile again. She’s teasing him.\n“Stop joking around…. Just get back to work.”\n“Okay.”\nThe office returned to its quiet atmosphere.\nSoon, the silence was broken by a loud bang as the door swung open.\n“Yesong, reporting as summoned~.”\nA languid voice filled the office.\n“You’re here.”\n“Welcome.”\nBoth Woo-jin and Baek-seo greeted the new girl in her school uniform.\nHer cap was precariously perched on her head, as if it would fall off at any moment. She yawned long, appearing sleepy.\n“Ahh…. Leader, can I take a nap before the meeting? I’m so sleepy….”\n“If you don’t stop referring to yourself in the third person, I’ll double your workload.”\n“That’s an abuse of power!”\nListening to her bizarre manner of speaking in Korean made him willing to abuse his power.\nIt was crossing a line.\nThis was Ha Yesong, a second-year student in charge of the disciplinary inspections. She was summoned for an unofficial meeting today.\n“Baek-seo…! Leader is too scary…!”\nFeigning tears, Yesong put down her cap and documents and sat next to Baek-seo, clinging to her arm.\n“Don’t worry. He wouldn’t really do that.”\nBaek-seo, smiling kindly like a saint, patted Yesong’s head, accepting her antics gracefully.\n“Baek-seo’s touch is so soothing….”\nYesong enjoyed Baek-seo’s gentle touch, looking like a melting puppy.\n……\n“Here. Proof that I worked hard!”\nThe three of them started the meeting.\nSitting next to Baek-seo, Woo-jin received the documents from Yesong. It was a report she had prepared.\n“I’ve singled out the key individuals among the new students.”\nThe meeting’s topic was to identify those who required attention and decide the level of monitoring necessary.\nThough not in violation of school regulations, this unofficial meeting was ethically questionable and needed to remain confidential. It had become a tradition due to its tangible results.\n‘How they verified the effectiveness remains a mystery.’\nI acknowledged the reasoning behind it.\nManaging all the students at Ahsung High School was a daunting task, considering that over 2,000 students enroll each year. It was necessary to identify and focus on students who required intensive monitoring.\nMoreover, in this world, students could wield the mysterious power of ‘magic.’ The danger posed by someone with malicious intent was incomparable to my previous life.\nStatistics also showed that repeat offenders had a high recidivism rate. This is why we decided to continue this tradition.\n‘The report is neatly done.’\nI reviewed the report Yesong handed over.\nIt recorded students among the new enrollees at Ahsung High School who had noteworthy characteristics that warranted attention from the disciplinary committee.\n‘I heard there were 54 last year, but this year… there are only about ten?’\nI had expected a thick file but was surprised to find it so thin.\nWhat was going on?\n“There are fewer than expected? Much fewer…”\nYesong responded confidently.\n“There were initially 60 candidates, but I’ve already investigated them. The rest only require a moderate level of attention. I’ll show you those later! Anyway, these are the ones we should focus on, so I, Yesong, dug deep into them!”\nThe reason I placed Ha Yesong in an executive position when I became the disciplinary committee leader was because, despite her appearance, she was diligent and competent.\nThe information on the ten students Yesong had selected was detailed and well-organized.\nAmong them were some troublemakers I recognized from the game. While they weren’t Great Villain level threats, they were definitely individuals the disciplinary committee needed to keep an eye on.\nAs expected, it was a trustworthy report. It saved me a lot of trouble.\n“You did well.”\n“Hehe.”\nI looked over the list of individuals to watch. One name immediately caught my eye.\nSomeone related to the recent subway incident.\n‘Lee Se-Ah. She’s on the list too.’\nThe student’s ID photo showed a girl with a gentle smile and closed eyes.\n‘The future Leader of the mafia… I didn’t expect her to be a student at our school.’\nLee Se-Ah was destined to lead the Do-hwa Group, a mafia organization, in the future. That’s why the mafia cherished her.\nEventually, she would become a Great Villain in the black market, but she was also fated to meet a mysterious death.\n‘It’s already publicly known that she’s affiliated with the mafia.’\nInterrogating Anomia revealed that the target of the subway incident was Lee Se-Ah.\nThus, the disciplinary committee summoned Lee Se-Ah and received her confession, “I am affiliated with the mafia.”\nLee Se-Ah hadn’t even tried to hide it. She must have concluded that there was no issue with revealing it.\nAnd indeed, there wasn’t.\n‘The mafia doesn’t have any overt problems right now.’\nAt this point, the mafia’s shady dealings hadn’t come to light.\nThe investigation concluded that the subway incident was a power struggle between two organizations that escalated into a violent clash.\nThe captured members of Anomia were handed over to the judicial academy on charges of committing a terror attack on public transportation.\nIn any case.\nBeing affiliated with a suspicious group that labeled itself as a ‘mafia’ and engaged in criminal activities was notable. Additionally, several students who secretly bullied or badmouthed Lee Se-Ah during middle school had suddenly dropped out, further solidifying her place on the watch list.\n‘A veiled presence with many suspicious circumstances….’\nThat’s what was written in the report. Yesong evaluated Lee Se-Ah in such a manner.\n‘Even if she becomes a villain later, she isn’t one yet. It’s best to monitor her for any suspicious activity.’\nWhether she was preparing to become a villain, already engaged in villainous activities secretly, or doing nothing at all, we decided to keep an eye on Lee Se-Ah.\nIf we detected any signs of her plotting a crime, it would be advantageous. We could preemptively strike and prevent any crimes.\n“Sir?”\n“What?”\nYesong suddenly called out to me. She was looking at me with a suspicious gaze.\n“Why are you staring at that girl’s photo? Did you fall for her at first sight? Is she your type, sir?”\nClatter!\nBaek-seo, who had been reading her report without any change in expression, swiftly flipped to the page with Lee Se-Ah’s information. Her hand moved so fast it was almost imperceptible.\nShe seemed curious.\n“…….”\nI glared at Yesong silently, narrowing my eyes.\n“It was a joke. Hehe. …I’m sorry.”\nYesong quickly apologized, sensing the mood.",

      "content": "Chapter 5 – Rule 4: The Leader monitors potential villains (1).\nThis is Academy City, ‘Neo Seoul.’\nThe villains that dominate Neo Seoul are called ‘Great Villains’.\nThe villains I must capture are destined to become the Great Villains. To be more specific, there are six of them, known as the ‘Six Sinners.’ Among these six is my childhood friend, Kim Dalbi.\nIn the game, there was an event separate from the main storyline where players could hunt down the Six Sinners. Being an open-world game, it was up to the player whether or not to participate in this event.\nThis implies that the main protagonist, Lee Taesung, is unlikely to be involved. Unless he suddenly decides, ‘I will capture the Six Sinners!’ with dramatic resolve.\n‘Hunting down the Six Sinners… It was the endgame content. It was really difficult at first.’\nThe Six Sinners event was one of the most challenging parts of the game.\nFortunately, I remember the timing of each Six Sinners event clearly. As it was the endgame content, it was memorable and easier to recall after the main story.\n‘I must capture them somehow.’\nIf the Six Sinners aren’t defeated by the end of the game, each of them becomes a ‘Great Villain’ and takes over Neo Seoul, becoming a ruler of the city.\nWhichever one it is, the city’s order collapses, leading to a dystopia.\nLeaving the academy city would mean facing an apocalyptic world swarming with monsters. To protect my home, I must stop the Six Sinners.\nAnd what about Lee Se-Ah?\n‘Lee Se-Ah isn’t one of the Six Sinners, but she is destined to become a Great Villain.’\nLee Se-Ah.\nFirst-year student at Ahsung High School.\nAge, 17.\nAffiliation, Volunteer Club.\nShe is a girl who is set to become the next boss of the Do-hwa Group, one of the syndicate-type organizations in the academy city. She becomes a villain and a Great Villain of the black market, but dies shortly after.\nBecause of this, Lee Se-Ah never turns the academy city into a dystopia, despite being an event villain.\nNevertheless, that’s no reason to ignore her.\n‘She’s probably planning something illegal by now. Even if she’s not, it’s necessary to monitor her. There’s no guarantee the world will unfold exactly as in the game.’\nIn this world, there is the Disciplinary Committee Leader, Ahn Woo-jin—me.\nSo, if the butterfly effect causes any variables that allow Lee Se-Ah to escape death, and she ends up becoming a major threat to the academy city?\nThat must not happen.\nI cannot allow it.\nTherefore, it was only right to monitor Lee Se-Ah.\n“So, you’re saying I should monitor my classmate, Lee Se-Ah?”\nIn the Disciplinary Committee office.\nA first-year female student asked me.\nI nodded.\nShe was a junior I called to the office.\nShe was a new member who joined the Disciplinary Committee this semester.\nI took notice of her during the final interview, where I served as one of the interviewers.\nI immediately recognized her skill in maintaining a poker face.\n‘Even now, her expressionless face is impressive.’\nI couldn’t read any emotions from her.\nIt was an art form, almost as if she had undergone assassin training.\nBeing adept at maintaining a poker face and having a cautious personality, she would handle the task of monitoring Lee Se-Ah better than most members.\n“Once again, Lee Se-Ah is a student belonging to a large secret organization, and she has recently been targeted by Anomia. I deemed it necessary to keep a close watch on her.”\n“Then, may I ask why you assigned this task to me?”\nYour poker face is excellent.\nBut.\n‘I shouldn’t answer honestly.’\nI didn’t want her to become self-conscious about her expression.\n“You’re in the same first-year C class in the Mae-hwa Hall as Lee Se-Ah. You simply stood out the most among your peers.”\n“I understand. Thank you for entrusting me with this task, Captain. I will bring back the best possible results.”\n“Hmm, okay. I’m counting on you.”\nThe expressionless junior saluted smartly.\nHer confidence made me feel proud.\nI should brag to the Vice-Leader about picking her.\n……\nA week later.\nIt was the day to receive the first report on Lee Se-Ah’s surveillance.\n‘Today, her expressionless face is fantastic as well.’\nThe expressionless junior came to see me, her face revealing no emotions.\nHer excellent poker face made me feel content.\nShe saluted smartly.\n“Leader, I am here to report.”\n“Go ahead.”\n“This is a report based on my direct observations and information I discreetly gathered, cross-verified for accuracy.”\nThe expressionless junior handed me the report she had prepared herself.\nThe design was clean and the readability was excellent.\n‘I didn’t ask for this?’\nShe produced such a report despite the tight deadline?\nIndeed, she is a promising talent I picked.\n“Tell me.”\nI spoke, hiding my proud feelings.\n“Yes. Firstly, Lee Se-Ah leads a group. She excels at bringing others to her side and is being pointed out as a strong candidate for class president.”\nThat was expected.\nLee Se-Ah would later become a villain who dominates the black market. She must be good at managing affairs and building networks.\n“And?”\nI asked as I began reading the report from the expressionless junior.\n“Secondly, she frequently performs good deeds.”\n‘What?’\nMy head lifted involuntarily.\n“Good deeds?”\nA girl destined to become the worst villain, a Great Villain, doing good deeds?\nIt was like a snake wearing wool and pretending to be innocent.\n“Yes, that’s correct.”\nThe expressionless junior answered without a hint of hesitation.\n“Isn’t it just because of club activities?”\n“No, it wasn’t.”\nI quickly skimmed through the report. The bulk of the content was about Lee Se-Ah’s good deeds.\nI read through these accounts.\n—\n**First Case:**\nThis concerns Min Hana, a first-year student from Class C of Mae-hwa Hall.\nOne day, Min Hana overslept and had to run to school to avoid being late. In her rush, she forgot to bring money and had no lunch. Being shy and having no friends yet, she ended up skipping lunch.\nMin Hana was silently enduring her hunger when four girls approached her all at once. It was Lee Se-Ah’s group.\n“Kikik…”\n“Keekeeke…”\nThe group laughed with witch-like cackles. Lee Se-Ah wore a sinister and cunning smile.\nIt was widely known within Ahsung High School that Lee Se-Ah was associated with a mafia-like organization. Her group was suspected of being the bullies of Class C.\nFrightened, Min Hana had always avoided them. But now they approached her.\n‘Why me…?’\nMin Hana’s heart raced. She feared they were targeting her to bully her. She felt her high school life might take a turn for the worse from the very start.\n“Hey, can I talk to you? I noticed you didn’t have lunch earlier.”\nLee Se-Ah leaned in with a sly tone.\n“Hiccup!”\nMin Hana was so startled that she hiccuped.\n“Yes, I didn’t… But why…?”\nMin Hana’s reply had a hint of tears despite her efforts. Lee Se-Ah smiled.\n“Then, take this money and go buy some bread.”\nThud.\nLee Se-Ah placed some money gently on Min Hana’s desk with a sneer.\n“Ah…!”\nIt was a disaster.\nHer words were clearly a declaration that she was making Min Hana her errand girl.\nWas she destined to be a toy for the mafia gang? Would she have to endure suffering surrounded by bullies?\nHer chest tightened. The hunger made her more emotional.\nShe regretted coming to Ahsung High School. If she had known, she wouldn’t have worked so hard to pass the entrance exam.\nAs Min Hana harbored these regrets and envisioned her worst future, she began to cry.\nBut then.\n“…Huh?”\nMin Hana looked at the money Lee Se-Ah had placed on her desk, puzzled.\nIt was a green bill with King Sejong’s face on it—a ten thousand won note. Considering bread at the school store cost around one to two thousand won, it was a generous amount.\nMin Hana looked at Lee Se-Ah with suspicion.\n“Get something nice and tasty. Hunger is painful, you know. Keke…”\n“Kikik…”\n“Keekeeke…”\nLee Se-Ah’s group laughed ominously as they walked away. Min Hana remained confused for a while, unsure how to interpret the situation.\nWhen Min Hana returned with bread from the school store, Lee Se-Ah’s group joined her in sharing the snacks and chatting cheerfully.\nMin Hana then realized that these girls were actually kind. It was a moment when her heart softened.\nThis account was recorded in the report after the expressionless junior secretly observed the situation and heard about Min Hana’s feelings directly from her.\n—\n**Second Case:**\nThis concerns Kim Deok-Soo, a second-year student from Class B of Yeonhwa Hall and a member of the Disciplinary Committee.\nKim Deok-Soo was leading two junior Disciplinary Committee members on an off-campus patrol.\nVroom!\nThe loud sound of an engine drew the patrol’s attention.\n“What is that? A motorcycle?”\n“Senior, over there!”\nSeveral bikes were roaring down the road.\nIt was a group of female students from Ahsung High School, riding motorcycles like a gang.\n“Kekeke!”\n“Kekeke!”\nThey laughed wickedly as they rode, staying within the speed limit.\nEach bike had a cargo box mounted on it, filled with heavy, bulky items. At the center of the group was a girl wearing sunglasses, riding an ATV designed for carrying goods. The ATV had even more cargo in its storage compartment.\n“Don’t they look suspicious…?”\nAs my junior said, it indeed looked suspicious.\nWere they transporting prohibited items? Recalling the disciplinary committee’s incident logs, this wasn’t uncommon. Ahsung High School was closest to the black market among all the academies. Every year, several students from Ahsung High were caught as illegal couriers.\nIt was unusual for any group to ride bikes like that.\nWhen suspicious circumstances are detected, it’s the patrol’s duty to intervene. We needed to verify whether they were engaging in illicit activities.\nKim Deok-Soo urgently shouted.\n“Stop them!”\n“Yes!”\nThe patrol team blocked the group of bikers, who were adhering to the speed limit.\nScreech. The bike group came to a sudden halt.\n“Who are you?”\nThe girl at the center, riding the ATV, leisurely removed her sunglasses and asked.\nHer narrow eyes, reminiscent of a fox’s smile, scanned the patrol members.\nIt was Lee Se-Ah, a first-year student at Ahsung High School.\n“We’re the disciplinary committee!”\n“Ah, I see. Now, please step aside.”\n“Hah, such arrogance!”\nSnap!",

      "content": "Chapter 5 (Continued)\nKim Deok-Soo drew his baton and pointed it at Lee Se-Ah.\n“Where did you get those bikes!? What’s with all that cargo!? Are you planning to make illegal deals in the black market? Or are you transporting prohibited items?”\nKim Deok-Soo’s juniors took a tense combat stance, ready to subdue Lee Se-Ah’s group if necessary.\n“Hmm, this is quite a misunderstanding.”\nLee Se-Ah glanced at a muscular girl riding a bike beside her.\n“Captain, could you help us out?”\n“Hmph!”\nAt Lee Se-Ah’s request, the muscular girl glared menacingly at Kim Deok-Soo. She was the captain of the Volunteer Club, one of the strongest at Ahsung High.\n“We are from the Volunteer Club. We are delivering rice and other food supplies to help the needy. If you don’t want to get hurt, clear the way immediately.”\n“Kikik…”\n“Kekeke… if you block our way, we’ll turn you into meat chunks…!”\nThe Volunteer Club members laughed sinisterly.\n“Don’t be ridiculous! Why would people like you, who ride bikes fit for gangsters…!”\n“Gangsters? These are precious bikes donated by members of Do-hwa Group, for our new member Lee Se-Ah’s family, to help the needy. If you insult our sponsors, we won’t stand by as the Volunteer Club.”\n“Keke…!”\nThe Volunteer Club members seemed ready for a fight.\nLee Se-Ah twirled her sunglasses between her fingers, wearing a fox-like grin.\nDespite the disciplinary committee’s top rank in force, Kim Deok-Soo and his two junior members couldn’t take on these girls. They might need to call for backup.\n“You guys…”\nKim Deok-Soo felt humiliated and furious. His pride was hurt.\nHowever, the disciplinary committee had significant authority.\n“Then, under the authority of the disciplinary committee, we will control the road and conduct an inspection! We need to check what’s in those bags. Unpack everything here!”\nAt that moment, the atmosphere grew tense, and the Volunteer Club members’ expressions stiffened.\n‘As expected, they’re not innocent.’\nIt was already widely known that Lee Se-Ah was involved with the mafia. Her organization was a potential threat, having even clashed with the illegal armed group, Anomia.\nNo matter what her organization was, who wouldn’t know that ‘mafia’ refers to a criminal organization?\nTherefore, it was possible that Lee Se-Ah had swayed the Volunteer Club.\nThe fact that the Volunteer Club’s captain mentioned ‘sponsorship’ suggested they were playing the role of couriers for Do-hwa Group’s illegal goods.\n“This is troublesome…”\nLee Se-Ah sighed, resting her sunglasses on her chin.\n“Then all the beautifully wrapped gifts we prepared for everyone’s happiness would be ruined? Disciplinary committee members, can’t you overlook it just this once?”\n“I said stop joking around.”\n“Oh dear, oh dear…”\nLee Se-Ah pondered for a moment before slyly smiling as if she had thought of something.\n‘What trick is she planning now?’\nKim Deok-Soo broke into a cold sweat.\n“Disciplinary committee members, were you on an off-campus patrol?”\n“And?”\nLee Se-Ah tilted her head to the side, pointing at herself with a sly smile.\n“How about joining us?”\n“What?”\nKim Deok-Soo couldn’t understand.\nAfterwards, the Volunteer Club members carried the disciplinary committee team on their bikes, strictly adhering to the speed limit as they rode.\nLee Se-Ah’s proposal was this:\nSince the disciplinary committee’s patrol area includes the jurisdiction, why not ride along with the Volunteer Club to keep an eye on them? Meanwhile, the Volunteer Club would continue their mission.\n‘Just try anything suspicious.’\nKim Deok-Soo was determined to uncover their wrongdoings.\n‘Huh?’\nHowever, Kim Deok-Soo’s determination proved futile.\nThe Volunteer Club, like Santa Claus, actually distributed the gift boxes to citizens facing difficult lives.\nTo students with disabilities who couldn’t engage in proper economic activities due to accidents.\nTo dropouts or students on leave due to various hardships, who were in financial distress.\nThey all opened their gifts and thanked the Volunteer Club.\nOccasionally, some people received the gifts with a sense of entitlement, but the Volunteer Club didn’t mind.\nDuring this process, the disciplinary committee patrol team sampled a small portion of the rice or other food supplies with the citizens’ consent.\n‘It’s real…?’\nIt was all ordinary food.\nThough the quality didn’t look great, the recipients were grateful nonetheless.\nOccasionally, Lee Se-Ah’s brows furrowed, seemingly annoyed, but the patrol team didn’t mind.\nLastly, the Volunteer Club provided substantial food support to a united volunteer club leading the efforts to help the underprivileged.\nThat day, Kim Deok-Soo’s patrol team concluded their mission with a warm realization in their hearts: ‘The world is still a kind place.’\nThis account was recorded in the report after the expressionless junior covertly learned about the Volunteer Club’s activities and heard the details of the situation from Kim Deok-Soo.\n—\n“……”\nApart from this, the report contained only heartwarming stories about Lee Se-Ah.\nLike how she carried an injured girl to the infirmary during P.E. class, helped a lost child find their home, and volunteered at a free meal service three times a week.\n‘What is this? Why are there only heartwarming stories…?’\nIt couldn’t be true.\nLee Se-Ah was destined to become a Great Villain!\n‘Could it be that she discovered she was being watched?’\nAlthough I didn’t know Lee Se-Ah well, I knew she had a sly side.\nIf I continued to have the expressionless junior monitor her, it would likely only add more heartwarming stories.\nThis wouldn’t do.\n“From today, you can stop the surveillance.”\n“Were you dissatisfied with my work?”\n“No. It’s just that I will handle it myself from now on.”\nWith the expressionless junior, it’s already game over.\nI must personally monitor Lee Se-Ah.\n—\n**Midnight.**\nIn a building located in the Black Market within the neutral zone.\nIn the dim light of a lamp, a man was trembling on the floor. He was a dropout student turned businessman active in the Black Market.\nAround him, his bodyguards lay bleeding, remnants of a fierce battle.\nThunk.\n“Urgh…”\nA female student in a black school uniform stepped on the man’s head.\nSlowly, she pressed his head down until his nose almost touched the marble floor.\n“Maintaining business ethics is crucial, even in the Black Market. Yet, here you are, manipulating prices, inflating costs, and selling substandard goods disguised as quality products. You’ve really overstepped. Did you think we were fools?”\nHer narrow eyes curved into a cruel smile as she looked down at him.\nShe was Lee Se-Ah, a first-year student at Ahsung High School.\nTwo other students in black attire stood by her, both capable of converting their mana into elemental power, marking them as formidable opponents.\n“No, I was wrong! Please forgive me! I’ll do anything, anything you want…!”\nThe man, who had been arrogant during their deal, was now begging for his life, feeling the overwhelming disparity in power after his bodyguards were easily defeated.\nLee Se-Ah chuckled.\n“Such a cliché line. Well, should I spare you then?”\nHope lit up the man’s face.\nAs Lee Se-Ah lifted her foot, he looked up at her with a face covered in a bloody nose, like he had found a lifeline.\n“Thank you for giving me a chance! I will truly do anything…!”\nLee Se-Ah crouched down, looking at him with a sweet smile while resting her chin on her hand.\n“Then, how about this? Walk around the bustling area of the Black Market naked, proclaiming, ‘I am a pig, oink oink’ every five seconds. For… a week?”\n“…What?”\nConfusion spread across the man’s face.\nHe had expected her to demand money. This command was a blow to his dignity as a human.\nDespite her upper hand, her refusal to gain any profit from the situation implied one thing: ‘You’re no longer of use.’\nLee Se-Ah chuckled.\n“You might get charged with public indecency, but it should be fine. This is a neutral zone, so enforcement is lax.”\n“Lee Se-Ah, please!”\n“If you’re just a pig, at least entertain me, won’t you?”\nThe man was speechless.\n“This is me being lenient. Or do you not want it?”\n“That… that’s…”\n“I’ve already let you go once. If you do nothing, there won’t be a second chance.”\nThe man bowed his head, tears streaming down his face.\n“I’ll do it…”\n“Good decision. I’ll be looking forward to it for the next week, starting tonight.”\nLee Se-Ah smiled brightly as she stood up.\nAt that moment, her smartphone vibrated in her uniform pocket. She checked the caller ID.\n“Let’s go.”\nLee Se-Ah led her two companions dressed in black away from the scene.\n—\nA deserted factory in the Black Market district.\nContrary to the dilapidated surroundings, a woman in a neat uniform of navy and gold leaned against a pillar. It was the uniform of Hanyang Federal Academy, with a coat draped over her shoulders.\nAs the sound of footsteps echoed, she stepped away from the pillar.\n“Oh dear, I made you wait, Jung-Mi!”\nLee Se-Ah’s voice resonated through the abandoned factory. She approached Lee Jung-Mi, the student from Hanyang Federal Academy, with a sly smile.\nThis was their agreed meeting spot.\n“No problem, Se-Ah.”\nJung-Mi greeted her with a slight bow.\nLee Se-Ah dragged over a worn-out chair, sitting with her legs straddling the backrest and resting her arms on it.\n“By the way, did you find it? The means by which the Disciplinary Committee Leader is monitoring the organizations?”\nLee Se-Ah asked, resting her chin on her folded arms.\nAnomia’s subway terror incident.\nBack then, Ahn Woo-Jin had preemptively countered Anomia’s plan. Moreover, he had a way to monitor multiple organizations in real-time.\nThus, Lee Se-Ah had instructed Jung-Mi to discover Ahn Woo-Jin’s surveillance methods.\nIf Ahn Woo-Jin was still watching her, she would have to remain cautious.\n“…I have nothing to report.”\nLee Se-Ah raised one eyebrow.\n“Whether the Disciplinary Committee Leader has pulled back or is mocking us by knowing our every move, I couldn’t uncover his surveillance methods.”\n“This is troubling.”\nLee Se-Ah straightened her back, lowered her head, and sighed deeply.\nHer slitted eyes gradually opened, revealing vivid red pupils.\n“I underestimated him. To think he is this capable…”\nAhn Woo-Jin’s abilities far exceeded Lee Se-Ah’s expectations.\nHe became the Disciplinary Committee Leader by surpassing Oh Baek-Seo, a genius in Neo Seoul. Naturally, he possessed extraordinary skills.\nEven so, to wage such an information war against multiple organizations was beyond belief. It felt almost fictitious, making her question her perception.\nYet, the undeniable evidence of the Anomia subway hijacking left her mind in turmoil.\nLee Se-Ah felt like a clown dancing on Ahn Woo-Jin’s palm.\n“This delays my plan to take over the Black Market.”\nThe Black Market was a hidden facet of the academy city, where illegal trades frequently occurred. It was a gold mine for black money.\nLee Se-Ah had planned to seize control of the Black Market as soon as she became the boss of the Do-hwa Group. Her goal was to rule the underworld.\nHer ideology was to use the underworld to pursue good deeds, making the academy city a better place.\nAlthough she couldn’t create a utopia for everyone, she wanted to make the world less miserable for at least one person.\n“It’s a headache. Anomia isn’t a problem, but the Disciplinary Committee Leader is too troublesome.”\nDespite clashing with Anomia over the Black Market, they weren’t a major issue.\nThe real problem was Woo-Jin’s intelligence network. Unless Lee Se-Ah could identify his hidden surveillance methods woven like a spider web throughout the academy city, she couldn’t proceed with her plan.\nThe Black Market, being a neutral zone, wasn’t under anyone’s jurisdiction. However, this also meant that any disciplinary committee could intervene there. Since it was a place where students committed crimes, various academy’s disciplinary committees were eager to crack down on it. Thus, if Lee Se-Ah displayed any suspicious behavior, she would become a target for the disciplinary committee.\n“…Hmm.”\nAs she pondered, a smile gradually spread across Lee Se-Ah’s face.\nA thought that had sparked like a small flame after the subway incident had now kindled into a full blaze, spreading throughout her mind.\n“Se-Ah…?”\n“Should we postpone our plans for a while?”\nLee Se-Ah returned to her slitted-eye look, her smile charming like that of a fox.\n“I just thought of something I want to do.”\n“What is it?”\nLee Se-Ah accessed the Ahsung High School Disciplinary Committee’s social media on her smartphone.\nShe zoomed in on the profile picture of the 45th Disciplinary Committee Leader, Ahn Woo-Jin, and showed it to Jung-Mi. Then she pointed at her phone with her index finger.\n“I want this person.”\nLee Se-Ah grinned slyly.\n“I need to have him.”\nAt this moment, Lee Se-Ah’s desire became concrete.\nHer interest in the Disciplinary Committee Leader deepened into a desire for possession.\nFacing a monster like Ahn Woo-Jin, with his authority and exceptional skills, it would be foolish to regard him as an enemy. Instead, it would be much more beneficial to recruit him as an ally.\n“…What?”\nJung-Mi needed a moment to grasp Lee Se-Ah’s words.\nThen.\n“What!?”\nHer voice echoed through the abandoned factory.",

      "content": "Chapter 6 – Rule 4: The Leader monitors potential villains (2).\n‘To keep an eye on Lee Se-Ah, I need to create a point of contact first.’\nI needed to create an environment where we could naturally meet and become friends.\nTrying to secretly monitor someone as perceptive as Lee Se-Ah would be a foolish choice.\n‘To make contact… is volunteer work my only option?’\nSince we were in different grades and different clubs, the only way to make contact was through Lee Se-Ah’s main activity, which was volunteering.\nConveniently, Lee Se-Ah volunteered three times a week at the free meal center, ‘One Meal of Love.’ This wasn’t an official activity of the Volunteer Club. She had been doing this even before she entered Ahsung High School.\nHowever, there was a risk involved.\n‘Then again, Lee Se-Ah might find me suspicious.’\nOn the surface, I was the person who preemptively understood Anomia’s plan and resolved the subway kidnapping incident.\nSo, it didn’t make sense that I wouldn’t know Lee Se-Ah was Anomia’s target.\nIf I suddenly started volunteering to get involved with Lee Se-Ah?\nShe would inevitably become suspicious.\n‘Isn’t there a more natural way?’\nI needed to think.\nA way to naturally make contact with Lee Se-Ah.\nA way to monitor her.\nI was deep in thought as I arrived at the shoe locker.\n“Huh?”\nThere was a note inside the shoe locker. Another confession letter?\nI read it.\n[Senior, feel free to monitor me. I won’t run away, haha – Lee Se-Ah]\n“……”\nWithout hesitation, I applied to volunteer at ‘One Meal of Love’ using my smartphone.\nWhat was I even worrying about, against someone who would become a master of the underworld? A feeling of futility washed over me.\n……\n“Thinking about helping the needy again today makes my heart flutter…, heh heh….”\n“Hee hee….”\n“Ha ha…. Poor folks, let us bestow some ‘good deeds’ upon them…!”\nAfter school.\nLee Se-Ah’s steps were light as she headed to ‘One Meal of Love’ with her fellow Volunteer Club members.\nWe shared the same destination. However, knowing that an awkward atmosphere would be inevitable, I kept a distance from them.\n“Welcome, Se-Ah!”\n“Oh, hello!”\nThe group was welcomed by the volunteers upon arriving at ‘One Meal of Love.’\nThe volunteers there were all about my age. Judging by their lack of school uniforms, they were likely dropouts, expelled students, or students on leave.\nAfter observing the situation from outside, I entered. Lee Se-Ah and her group were donning red aprons over their black uniforms.\n“Huh? Are you new here?”\n“I’m Ahn Woo-jin.”\nWhen the volunteer awkwardly asked, I took off my hat and greeted politely.\nI had taken off the Disciplinary Committee Leader armband and put it in my pocket.\n“?”\nLee Se-Ah glanced at me and started whispering with her group.\nIt was a natural reaction.\nA student at Ahsung High School who didn’t know me was either a dumb spy or a recluse completely disconnected from the world. At least, Lee Se-Ah and her group didn’t seem to fall into those categories.\nThe volunteer who welcomed me had a bright smile on their face.\n“Yes, Woo-jin. Welcome! We will open at 6 o’clock. Until then, we’ll be preparing the meals.\nWould you mind taking charge of the rice?”\n“Sure, no problem.”\n“Thank you.”\nAfterward, the volunteer briefly explained what I needed to do. Since it wasn’t complicated, there was no need to rack my brain.\nI took off my school jacket and put on a red apron, then headed towards the warming machine. I could still feel Lee Se-Ah’s gaze. When I looked at her, our eyes met.\nLee Se-Ah beamed brightly. She seemed genuinely pleased to see me.\n‘What was I being so cautious about…?’\nI had no idea when she realized I was monitoring her.\nI suddenly felt foolish for trying to secretly monitor such a person.\nLee Se-Ah and her group bowed to me. It was a sign of respect towards the Disciplinary Committee Leader. I just nodded and started moving the cart.\nLarge rice containers were stacked vertically and kept warm. I moved the hot containers from the warming machine to the cart and placed them in a convenient location for replacement during the free meal service.\nJust before 6 o’clock,\nI stood in front of the rice containers with a rice paddle.\nNext to me, handling the soup, was Lee Se-Ah. She kept stirring the miso soup in the soup pot with a ladle.\nWe were ready to welcome those lining up outside.\n“Did you check your horoscope today?”\n“?”\nA sudden question popped out of Lee Se-Ah’s mouth. Her voice was fluttery like a butterfly’s wing.\nHer squinting eyes were directed at me.\n“Horoscope?”\n“I’m a Sagittarius. What about you, Disciplinary Committee Leader?”\n“I’m a Sagittarius too.”\n“Oh, we have something in common?”\nLee Se-Ah giggled.\nA horoscope, huh? Now I was curious.\n“What does today’s horoscope say?”\n“It says to be cautious of the person you meet today. It could turn into a deep connection or a bad relationship.”\nSwish.\nI immediately took out my smartphone to check my horoscope.\n“…What are you doing?”\n“Verification. I can’t rest easy until I confirm things like this.”\n“Wow~, you really live up to being the Disciplinary Committee Leader! I didn’t expect this…!\nTruly impressive, really.”\nLee Se-Ah chuckled, seemingly amused.\n“It’s true.”\nThe Sagittarius horoscope was exactly as Lee Se-Ah had said.\nI quickly put my smartphone back in my pocket.\n“Senior. Do you think we will have a good relationship or a bad one?”\nProbably a bad one.\nI’m someone who needs to catch villains, and you’re someone who’s going to become one.\n“With the number of people I’ve met today, how can I determine that for each person?”\n“Oh, you’re quite cold. It’s all just for fun, anyway. By the way, have you always been active in volunteer work, Senior?”\nSe-Ah smoothly shifted the topic to something new.\nDespite this being our first conversation, there wasn’t a hint of awkwardness. It felt like the flow of conversation was natural from the start.\n‘Let’s not let my guard down….’\nIt was all part of Se-Ah’s plan.\nIn the game, Lee Se-Ah becomes the head of the Do-hwa Group and a significant villain in the underworld. She’s excellent at business and has a knack for charming people.\nIf I didn’t watch out for her silver tongue, I might find myself entranced by her without realizing it.\nI needed to be cautious.\n“I haven’t done much of it. What about you?”\n“Is there any need to ask?”\nHer eyes formed a crescent shape, and she wore a subtle, enigmatic smile.\n“You came here knowing everything already.”\n“……”\n…Right.\nWe weren’t naive enough to be having innocent chit-chat pretending we didn’t know anything.\nRing!\n“It’s 6 o’clock! Everyone, please come in one by one!”\nThe bell rang just as the door opened, and the volunteer welcomed the people lined up outside into the meal center.\nThey were all teenagers or young adults.\nI served the appropriate amount of rice onto the trays they brought. Since there wasn’t much to say, I stayed quiet while doing it, but next to me, Se-Ah kept chatting non-stop.\n“Enjoy your meal. I tasted the miso soup earlier, and it was fantastic!”\n“Wow~, your bangs are really nicely cut. Did you do it yourself? Wow, could you help me with mine next time?”\n“Heh, you look better since you started dating, don’t you?”\n“Oh, you’re refusing the soup solids? You might regret that.”\nWith her sociable personality and years of volunteer experience, she seemed to get along well with everyone. Even I, standing next to her, felt a sense of familiarity.\nHonestly, seeing her laughing and chatting with people was quite a pleasant sight.\nBut Lee Se-Ah was essentially a wolf in sheep’s clothing. I couldn’t be fooled by appearances.\n“Am I bothering you?”\n“What?”\nSe-Ah suddenly asked me.\n“I wasn’t even looking at you.”\n“But you did? At least six times with side glances? Oh dear…, was it my mistake?”\nSe-Ah smiled playfully.\nIndeed, I had glanced at her five or six times.\nI realized once again.\nThe moment I thought I could secretly monitor this person was a mistake.\n……\n“Good job, everyone!”\n“You all did great~.”\nThe doors of ‘One Meal of Love’ closed, and the cleanup was finished.\n“Ha ha…. Not much food waste. We’ve reduced waste…!”\n“Hmm…, it was worth serving generously.”\nLee Se-Ah and her group laughed slyly, almost as if they were plotting a crime. Judging by their expressions alone, they seemed like they were about to commit a serious crime.\nHowever, their conversation was as wholesome and heartwarming as something out of an elementary school textbook.\nAs I took off my apron and put on my school jacket, I made eye contact with Se-Ah. She smiled sweetly and then spoke to her group.\n“You guys go ahead. I have an appointment with the Disciplinary Committee Leader.\nApparently, there’s something he needs to discuss with me regarding the last incident, or maybe something about the disciplinary committee?”\nSe-Ah made an excuse to her friends.\n* * *\nThe ‘One Meal of Love’ members dispersed, leaving Ahn Woo-jin and Lee Se-Ah alone as they walked to the park. The sun had completely set by then.\n“Drink up. I don’t know if you like it or not.”\nWoo-jin handed a can of coffee to Se-Ah.\nSince they weren’t in an adversarial relationship yet, and he didn’t have any ill feelings toward her, he bought her a drink as a senior.\n“Wow, I love coffee. Thanks, I’ll enjoy it.”\nSe-Ah accepted the warm can of coffee and pressed it against her soft, white cheek, savoring the warmth.\n“It’s warm~.”\nThey leaned against the fence side by side, sipping their canned coffee.\nThe park’s scenery, illuminated by streetlights, unfolded before their eyes. Being spring, the flowers were in full bloom.\nA spring breeze caressed their skin, and Woo-jin finally spoke.\n“When did you find out?”",

      "content": "Chapter 6 (Continued)\nSe-Ah smiled slyly as if she had been waiting for this question.\n“Would it be too vague if I said ‘a little late’?”\nThe Anomia subway kidnapping incident.\nWoo-jin had likely been monitoring Se-Ah long before that incident occurred.\nSo, saying “a little late” was essentially acknowledging Woo-jin’s skills.\n“No… that’s sufficient.”\nWoo-jin understood Se-Ah’s meaning. It was a compliment that it was difficult to detect his surveillance methods.\nHowever, the misunderstanding was that Woo-jin took “a little late” to mean “during the surveillance through the expressionless junior from the first year.”\n‘Our expressionless junior did quite well. For Se-Ah to say “a little late,” that’s impressive.’\nWoo-jin nodded in satisfaction.\nFor Lee Se-Ah, the future big shot of the underworld, to give such praise.\nEven though his surveillance had been discovered, everyone makes mistakes. The expressionless junior was surely a promising member of the Disciplinary Committee.\n“But senior.”\n“Yeah.”\n“Why were you monitoring me? It seems tiring for both of us.”\nQuite a direct question.\nSe-Ah looked up at me, tilting her head while pointing at her cheek with her index finger, smiling like a fox.\n“Did you perhaps fall for me?”\nAs if.\n“Not a chance.”\n“Considering how meticulous you are, I wondered.”\n“You know the reason, don’t you? Is there a need to answer that?”\n“Haha.”\nOf course, her earlier question was a joke.\nSe-Ah looked down at her can of coffee.\nWhy would someone like the Disciplinary Committee Leader monitor her?\nIt was likely that Woo-jin could see through organizations like Anomia with ease.\nThe reason he was monitoring her must have been because he discovered her plan to take over the black market.\nGiven that Anomia’s plans had been exposed, it made sense that her plans would be no exception.\nSe-Ah smirked.\nShe really couldn’t beat this man.\nShe needed to recruit him as an ally.\n“Senior, can I get your number?”\n“……?”\nSe-Ah held out her smartphone with a bright smile.\nWoo-jin tried to discern her intentions for a moment.\n“Why?”\n“To get closer from now on. If you’re uncomfortable, we can exchange CoconutTalk IDs.”\nCoconutTalk was a messenger app used by most citizens of Neo Seoul.\nThere was no problem with that.\nIn fact, staying in contact with Se-Ah might allow him to gather useful information from her.\nConsidering this advantage, Woo-jin took Se-Ah’s smartphone.\n“Thank you, senior!”\nSe-Ah couldn’t hide her happiness when my ID was added to her friends on the messenger.\n‘She just looks like a cute junior like this….’\nIn a normal relationship, she would have been the kind of junior he would have gotten close to, even breaking his poker face a bit.\nBut thinking about the inevitable confrontation with Se-Ah, and her sudden death that would eventually come, made him not want to get closer to her.\n* * *\n[Lee Se-Ah: Dun-dun!]\n[Lee Se-Ah: Lee Se-Ah]\n[Lee Se-Ah: Is!]\n[Lee Se-Ah: Here!]\n[Ahn Woo-jin: What’s up, Se-Ah?]\n……\n[Lee Se-Ah: Senior!]\n[Lee Se-Ah: What are you doing right now!?]\n[Ahn Woo-jin: Why?]\n[Lee Se-Ah: Just curious]\n[Lee Se-Ah: Wondering if you’re stalking me right now]\n[Lee Se-Ah: (Emoticon of a person laughing sneakily with hands over mouth)]\n[Ahn Woo-jin: …Go to sleep. It’s late.]\n……\n[Lee Se-Ah: Senior!]\n[Lee Se-Ah: Senior!]\n[Lee Se-Ah: I have an emergency!]\n[Lee Se-Ah: A really big problem!]\n[Ahn Woo-jin: ?]\n[Ahn Woo-jin: What’s up? What happened?]\n[Lee Se-Ah: I think]\n[Lee Se-Ah: I’m really bored, which I think is a huge problem!]\n[Lee Se-Ah: Can I come to the Disciplinary Committee room to hang out? Haha]\n[Lee Se-Ah: (Emoticon of someone pleading with sparkling eyes)]\n[Ahn Woo-jin: ….]\n[Ahn Woo-jin: No. Only members are allowed.]\n[Lee Se-Ah: Oh, how stingy]\n……\n[Lee Se-Ah: LOL]\n[Lee Se-Ah: (Photo)]\n[Lee Se-Ah: I caught a picture of you eating lunch, Senior!]\n[Lee Se-Ah: It turned out really funny]\n[Lee Se-Ah: LOL]\n[Ahn Woo-jin: When did you manage to take that…?]\n[Lee Se-Ah: Senior]\n[Lee Se-Ah: Eating instant food all the time is bad for your health]\n[Lee Se-Ah: (Emoticon of someone glaring seriously with sparkling eyes)]\n[Lee Se-Ah: If you want to keep stalking me, you need to take care of your health first, right? LOL]\n[Ahn Woo-jin: …I’m busy.]\n[Lee Se-Ah: Haha]\n[Lee Se-Ah: Shall we eat together next time?]\n[Ahn Woo-jin: No, I’m fine…]\n“Leader, would you like me to make some coffee?”\nIn the Disciplinary Committee office.\nI looked up to see the smiling face of the deputy head, Oh Baek-seo. It was her usual serene smile.\n“Sure. But could you make it tea instead?”\n“Got it.”\nBaek-seo walked into the break room next door. It was an open space without a door.\nAs I resumed texting with Lee Se-Ah on CoconutTalk, I could hear Baek-seo opening the cupboard.\n“By the way, boss.”\n“Yeah.”\n“Who have you been messaging so much lately?”\nHmm?\nSuddenly, the gentle tone from the break room pierced my ears like a sharp knife.\nThough her voice was kind, it felt as if a blade was at my throat.\n…It must be my imagination.\n“You’re not usually one for texting, are you? You’ve been doing it quite a lot lately.”\n“Have I?”\n“Yes, you have.”\nBaek-seo replied firmly.\n‘I haven’t been doing it that much…’\nLee Se-Ah frequently sent me messages on CoconutTalk.\nEven though I tried to reply slowly to keep some distance, Se-Ah’s immediate and friendly messages somehow made me feel a sense of guilt.\nI needed to maintain contact with Se-Ah anyway, so I had merely reduced my response speed. It might be an excuse to assuage my guilt, though.\nIn any case, it wasn’t accurate to say I texted a lot.\n“It’s just someone under surveillance. One of them.”\n“Ah, I see. Part of the job then? Who is it?”\n“Lee Se-Ah.”\nFor a brief moment, the sound of rummaging through the cupboard stopped.\n“…Diligent as always. Given she’s a surveillance target, that makes sense.”\nBaek-seo nodded in understanding.\nSoon, she brought the tea over.\n“Thanks…”\n…?\nBaek-seo’s fingers holding the tea cup were red and steaming. It was clear she had just gotten burned.\n“Baek-seo, your hand…!”\n“This? It’s fine. I must have poured the water wrong.”\nIsn’t that a bit too casual…?\n“Doesn’t it hurt…?”\nShe looked like she had poured boiling water directly on her hand.\nHow does one even manage to do that?\nEven I couldn’t maintain my poker face. I was deeply concerned about Baek-seo.\nBut she just smiled gently as if it was nothing.\n“Boss, I’m going to the infirmary.”\n“Uh, yeah, go quickly….”\nBaek-seo headed towards the exit.\nAs she pushed one of the double doors open, she accidentally bumped her forehead against the other door, which hadn’t opened.\nI couldn’t help but stand up in shock.\n“Baek-seo!?”\n“I’m fine. No problem.”\nBaek-seo smiled at me with her forehead turning red, then left the room.\nIs she not feeling well today?",

      "content": "Chapter 7 – Rule 5: The Leader Cares for the Vice-Leader\nOh Baek-seo.\nAs the Vice-Leader of the Disciplinary Committee at Ahsung High School, she’s known among the students as the “Right Hand of the Disciplinary Committee Leader.”\nThe Baek-seo I know is a master of reading the room. Sometimes, it feels like she can read my mind or see the future. If this were a workplace, Baek-seo would undoubtedly be on the fast track to promotion.\nRecently, however, she’s been showing signs of strain.\n‘A strange occurrence.’\nOne of her hands was bandaged due to a burn.\nThanks to the healing mage in the infirmary, she would be fully healed in four days, but it was still worrying to see.\nSince our first year, Baek-seo had always been perfect. This was the first time I’d seen her out of sorts since entering Ahsung High School.\n‘Well, nobody’s perfect.’\nSpending more time together as the Leader and Vice-Leader, I began to see sides of her that I hadn’t noticed before.\nI nodded in acceptance, finding joy in discovering this new side of her. It made her more human.\nHowever, that didn’t stop me from worrying.\n‘…Something bad hasn’t happened, has it?’\nIf Baek-seo showed signs of strain again, I would ask her seriously if something was wrong and use any means necessary to help her.\nBaek-seo is my closest ally and dear friend.\nWadada!\nSuddenly, there was a commotion in the hallway, and the door to the Disciplinary Committee office swung open.\n“The wild Ha Yesong has appeared!”\nAs expected.\n“Welcome.”\n“Hi, Leader!”\nHa Yesong, the member in charge of managing public morals, made her entrance.\n“Come on in.”\nBaek-seo, who was reviewing an agenda while sipping tea, welcomed Yesong warmly.\n“Baek-seo~! You’re beautiful as always! Huff huff!”\nYesong enjoyed the affectionate touch of Baek-seo, who was smiling kindly.\nA usual sight.\nYesong idolized Baek-seo and liked her very much.\nAlthough this affection turned Yesong into a puppy-like character, it was clearly a positive feeling.\n“Is your hand okay now? Does it hurt? Our precious Baek-seo’s hand…”\n“It’s fine.”\nI looked up from my documents, watching Baek-seo and Yesong interact.\n“Hmmm…”\nSince becoming the Leader, I had increasingly felt something whenever I saw Yesong.\nIt was an inconvenience that arose after appointing Yesong as an officer, especially in comparison to Baek-seo.\nIt was the length of her skirt.\nThat kid’s skirt was short, even as an officer. Her legs were too visible.\n‘Should I mention it or not….’\nRecalling my past life, pointing out the length of a skirt at work was considered workplace harassment.\nThat’s why I had been deliberating.\nI didn’t want Yesong to feel sexually harassed.\n“Leader, do you have something to say to me?”\nYesong asked me with a questioning expression.\n…It couldn’t wait any longer.\nToday, I had to say it.\n‘An officer’s shortcomings can directly impact my authority.’\nI decided this was a matter to be taken seriously. I had a valid reason to point out the skirt length.\n“Ha Yesong.”\n“Yes, Leader.”\nI pointed at Yesong and reprimanded her.\n“Article 45, Section 5, Clause 2 of the dress code states that the skirt length should not exceed 10 cm above the knee. We respect individual expression, but your skirt is well beyond the limit.”\n“?”\n“You are an officer now. You need to strictly adhere to the rules and set an example for the students. If you want to wear a short skirt, wear pants. If you want to show your legs, wear shorts.”\n“……?”\n“And especially since you’re in charge of managing public morals, you need to conduct yourself properly.”\nHmm….\nWas that too pedantic?\nNo.\n‘This is necessary discipline.’\nHow could I condone someone responsible for managing public morals blatantly violating the dress code by wearing such a short skirt and exposing her legs carelessly?\nYesong, as an officer of the Disciplinary Committee, needed to comply with the dress code.\n“…….”\nBut for some reason, Yesong was staring at me with wide eyes without responding.\nSoon, she reacted unexpectedly.\n“Kkondae.” (TL – The slang noun kkondae is used by students and teenagers in korea to refer to older people such as fathers and teachers)\n“What?”\nI doubted my ears for a moment.\nI heard a word that didn’t fit me at all.\nYesong turned towards me, resting her hand on the sofa’s backrest, and started a passionate speech.\n“Leader, you’re such an old-fashioned person! Your mindset is stuck in the past! I can’t believe someone like you still exists among the new generation!”\nI couldn’t believe it.\n‘She called someone as open-minded as me a kkondae…?’\nThe scolding earlier was for her, me, and the Disciplinary Committee’s sake.\nAnd she calls me a kkondae?\nThat’s nonsense.\n“…Ha Yesong. Even as a joke, that’s hard to ignore.”\n“Isn’t it true?”\n“No. You’re the first to call me that, in this life or my past one.”\n“Yesong covered her mouth and laughed slyly.\n“Oh, is that so~.”\nYe-song slowly approached my desk.\nThere it is, that look in her eyes.\nThe look of someone who has found her prey.\n“Leader?”\nYe-song leaned forward, covering her mouth with her hand and speaking conspiratorially.\n“If that’s the case, how about a test?”\n“A test?”\n“Let’s determine today if you’re really a kkondae or not.”\nAmusing.\nWhatever it was, I was confident.\n“Alright, go ahead.”\nI accepted the challenge.\nIf Ye-song tried to label me as a kkondae with some bizarre argument, I planned to counter her logic.\n“How about we involve the Vice-Leader too?”\nWe couldn’t leave our dear Vice-Leader out.\n“Sounds good.”\nBaek-seo joined with a smile.\n“No problem. Shall I ask the question?”\nYe-song placed her hand on my desk and boldly asked as if presenting a quiz.\n“You’re at a Disciplinary Committee dinner at a BBQ restaurant! But your subordinate isn’t grilling the meat and is just busy stuffing themselves. What do you and the Vice-Leader do?”\n“What…?”\n‘A subordinate not grilling the meat…?’\nCould that even happen…?\nI was flustered by the unexpected intensity of the question.\n‘It feels uncomfortable…?’\nThe more I thought about it, the more my mouth itched to say something.\nRecalling my past life, in both the military and the workplace, such a thing was unimaginable.\nEven here in the Disciplinary Committee.\nLast year, I diligently grilled the cultured meat…!\nHowever.\n‘Pointing out the grilling and scolding the subordinate would undeniably mark me as a kkondae.’\nIt was an uncomfortable and frustrating situation no matter how I looked at it.\nAt that moment, a doubt arose, making my eyes widen.\n‘Am I… a kkondae after all?’\nMy hand holding the pen trembled slightly.\nNo matter how much I thought about it, my mind leaned towards the kind of answer a kkondae would give.\n‘Calm down.’\nI decided to defer my answer.\nI straightened up and spoke cautiously.\n“Let’s reverse it.”\n“Huh?”\n“Let’s say you’re at a BBQ dinner, and senior students are grilling the meat. If you realized you were only eating, Ye-song, what would you do?”\nYe-song answered with a wide grin.\n“I’d ask them to grill it even better!”\n!\n‘How could she say that…!?’\nJust imagining it made me feel like coughing up blood.\n‘You should be the one grilling!’\nWhy aren’t you grilling the meat?\nThe seniors are grilling it, and you’re just eating…!\n“Hm.”\nI pretended to be calm, pondering.\nShould I answer honestly or mix in a bit of a lie to give a diplomatic response?\nShould I admit I was a kkondae or not?\nThat question weighed heavily on my mind, causing inner turmoil.\nThis was a significant issue involving self-reflection, not just a lighthearted exchange.\nI reminded myself as if casting a spell.\n‘As the Leader of the Disciplinary Committee, which ranks number one in Ahsung High School’s power hierarchy, I must clarify this matter. Whether the authority figure is a kkondae affects the satisfaction level of Disciplinary Committee activities.’\nEven if a Leader had charisma, low satisfaction would lead to decreased loyalty and morale among committee members.\nThus, as their leader, I needed to establish my values clearly.\n‘What a profound question….’\nIn 17 years of reincarnation in this world, I had never faced such a dilemma.\nWhat should I say?\nWhat answer is most appropriate for the Disciplinary Committee Leader, Ahn Woo-jin?\n“However.”\nAt that moment, Baek-seo spoke with a doubtful expression.\n“Isn’t it right to ask a junior to grill the meat?”\n“Huh…?”",

      "content": "Chapter 7 – Rule 5: The Leader Cares for the Vice-Leader\nBaek-seo spoke firmly.\n“I think it’s a matter of respect. If there’s such a lack of respect between seniors and juniors, it could become problematic. Especially in the Disciplinary Committee, where hierarchy is crucial. It’s kind of problematic.”\n‘Baek-seo…!’\nWhat a clear answer!\nHer straightforwardness never disappoints.\n“Huh…?”\nYe-song looked surprised, not expecting such a response from the usually kind Baek-seo. An unexpected silence followed.\nEventually, Ye-song spoke reluctantly.\n“Is that… so?”\nAs previously mentioned, Baek-seo is Ye-song’s idol.\nEven if it was me, she hesitated to call Baek-seo a kkondae.\nBaek-seo looked at me.\n“What about you, Leader?”\n“I agree with the Vice-Leader.”\n“There you have it.”\nBaek-seo and I exchanged words naturally, as if we had anticipated this flow.\nYe-song let out a frustrated groan, pondering for a while before speaking again.\n“Then, let’s put that answer on hold and move on to the next question! Do you often say things like ‘Back in my day’ and tell juniors that things are easier now?”\n“I haven’t said it often, but I did emphasize that the current system is better than last year’s, considering the stricter discipline I implemented.”\n“Then…! If you saw a junior arriving later than you for club activities, would you find it bothersome!?”\n“Unless I arrived early due to a busy schedule? Even so, I’d think juniors should arrive earlier than me.”\n“Do you think juniors should attend gatherings as much as possible…?”\n“Wouldn’t that be better? As new members, they should make an effort to build camaraderie.”\nYe-song paused, seemingly struggling with her next question, as if the answers she received weren’t what she expected.\nAs Ye-song bombarded me with questions, Baek-seo answered each one with a serene smile, never hesitating. Each time she did, she would turn to me and ask, “What about you, Leader?” and I would have no choice but to respond, “Me too.”\nYe-song was taken aback, unable to pull her pranks because Baek-seo preemptively gave the answers she expected from me.\n‘This is….’\nIn hindsight, wasn’t this a situation that could have damaged my image?\nIt felt like the Vice-Leader had taken the burden for me, almost as if she was protecting my image.\n“Hm….”\nBaek-seo awkwardly smiled, twirling a lock of her hair around her finger.\nHer eyes darted to the side.\nIt seemed like she was intentionally acting awkward, but given her kind and pure nature, that couldn’t be the case.\nThen, Baek-seo looked back at Ye-song and me, cautiously asking.\n“Am I a bit of a kkondae?”\n“No, no, Baek-seo! You could never be a kkondae!”\nYe-song reacted hastily, shaking her head vehemently.\nIf Baek-seo, who was considered a goddess and an angel at Ahsung High School, was a kkondae, then the term “kkondae” would need to be redefined to mean “saint.”\nYe-song then turned back to me with a forced smile, nodding.\n“Um, I guess the question was wrong! If the world considers Baek-seo a kkondae, then the world must be wrong!”\nThat value judgment was certainly valid.\nIt wasn’t our Vice-Leader who was wrong; it was the world.\nYe-song, looking dejected, returned to the sofa.\nShe seemed like a child who had found a toy she wanted but couldn’t play with it.\nThen, she lowered her head.\n“I was arrogant… I’m sorry for trying to determine if you’re a kkondae with my narrow-minded thinking….”\n“Um? There’s no need to apologize. I don’t understand why you’re saying sorry.”\nBaek-seo looked puzzled but then smiled benevolently and patted Ye-song’s head.\nTaking advantage of the moment, I asked.\n“So, what about your skirt?”\n“I’ll lengthen it….”\nYe-song conceded and retreated.\nThat was satisfactory.\n“By the way, how many questions did you plan to ask?”\nBaek-seo kindly asked Ye-song.\n“About 12? Never mind, I’ll just drop them all… I’ve lost the mood. I’d rather enjoy more of Baek-seo’s attention….”\nHmm.\nHowever, this…\n‘It ended too easily.’\nThe crucial questioning didn’t happen.\n‘But….’\nYe-song probably asked these questions playfully, but they unexpectedly presented me with a serious issue.\nIt wasn’t just about maintaining my dignity and authority as the Disciplinary Committee Leader.\nThat was just the bare minimum responsibility of a leader.\nHow should I lead the Disciplinary Committee in the future?\nHow should I balance honesty and pretense at every moment?\nI had to find the appropriate middle ground….\n“Leader, are you deep in thought?”\n“Leader, thinking dirty thoughts?”\nMy contemplation about my attitude as the Disciplinary Committee Leader was abruptly interrupted by the puppy and the angel.\n……\n“Three days ago, around 12:49 PM, there was a hostage situation at the second cafeteria.”\nThe setting sun shone through the window, softly illuminating the room. I liked the atmosphere, so I left the lights off.\nSitting at my desk, I listened to the Vice-Leader of the Disciplinary Committee, Oh Baek-seo, as she briefed me on the incident. She stood in front of me, looking at the documents as she continued speaking.\nWhile attentively listening, I occasionally glanced at the hand holding the clipboard. Though her burn had healed and the bandages were off, I still felt concerned.\n“The perpetrator held a victim and caused a commotion against the cafeteria staff. They even used magic.”\nThe cafeteria club managed the school’s meals.\nThey were responsible for planning balanced diets suitable for the students’ age and development, cooking, and serving.\nI clicked my tongue while looking at the perpetrator’s details in the report.\n“Hostile acts against the cafeteria club are equivalent to challenging the school. There’s no room for leniency. According to the school rules, they should be punished as severely as possible.”\n“Understood, I’ll reflect that. But 600 students have submitted a petition for the perpetrator’s exoneration. Should we ignore that?”\n“What?”\n“A petition…? 600 students in just three days?”\nBaek-seo nodded.\nAttacking the cafeteria club was an act that hindered public interest. It was an inexcusable crime.\nI couldn’t understand why as many as 600 students supported the perpetrator.\n…Wait.\n“Why did the perpetrator do it?”\n“They didn’t like mint chocolate being on the menu. The incident was triggered because mint chocolate was served that day.”\nI inhaled sharply.\n“Also, they couldn’t tolerate the fact that mint chocolate appeared on the menu three times this month.”\n“Three times…?”\n“The new nutritionist in the cafeteria insisted on including mint chocolate.”\nThis was unbelievable.\n“In any case, it’s a serious crime, so we should punish them with the maximum severity…”\n“Vice-Leader.”\nI narrowed my eyes, placing my arms on the desk and looking at Baek-seo intently. For some reason, Baek-seo smiled brightly when our eyes met.\n“Yes, Leader?”\n“As the Disciplinary Committee Leader, I command you to reduce the severity of the punishment as much as possible.”\n“Huh?”\n“It was a crime committed for the public good. There are plenty of grounds for mitigation.”\nThe person was a hero who sacrificed themselves for the future of the school.\nEven so, they broke the rules, and they had to be punished accordingly.\n‘Argh.’\nIt frustrated me that this was all I could do.\nI’m sorry, hero, that I can only offer you this much.\n“Hmm, understood.”\nBaek-seo shrugged her shoulders.\n‘What?’\nShe accepted it just like that?\nBaek-seo made a gesture indicating she had finished her report, organizing the documents on her clipboard and hugging them close.\n“You’re not asking for a reason?”\n“I serve you closely, don’t I? If it’s your command, I’ll follow it without question. I’ll handle the mitigation accordingly.”\n“……”\nBaek-seo was speaking with an air of natural authority.\nI leaned back in my chair.\n“Hm…”\n“Leader, what’s the matter?”\nI knew.\n‘In the game, she wasn’t this compliant.’\nAlthough Baek-seo’s role in the game was minor, it was clear she wasn’t someone who followed the Disciplinary Committee Leader so obediently.\nWith all the recent attention I’d been paying to Baek-seo, various thoughts had been crossing my mind.\nThis made me realize even more.\n“No, it’s just that I’m grateful.”\nThat Baek-seo was very important to me.\nBaek-seo seemed surprised by my answer, then she smiled kindly.\n“Really?”\nSuddenly, Baek-seo leaned towards me, a playful glint in her eyes.\n“If you’re grateful for my loyalty, why not praise me?”\n“Huh?”\nSometimes, Baek-seo would come at me like this, catching me off guard and tugging hard at my words.\n“Occasionally, I need some praise to recharge my motivation.”\nShe smiled mischievously, her eyes full of anticipation.\n‘This is a bit burdensome…’\nShe turned my “I’m grateful” into an excuse for praise.\nIt seemed like it would be difficult to just let this pass.\nThe words that immediately came to mind were ‘capable and beautiful.’ Baek-seo was a woman I liked enough to consider as the top candidate for the vacant position of my bride.\nHowever, saying ‘beautiful’ to someone who wasn’t particularly close could make them uncomfortable and risk awkwardness between us.\n“Hmm, then….”\nFrom a colleague’s perspective….\nI decided to give some neutral praise.\n“You’re capable, strong, and diligent. Among the people I’ve seen, you’re close to perfect. That’s why I want to keep you by my side.”\n“…Really?”\n“Yes. You’re always reliable and dependable.”\n“Hmm. Would you pat my head too?”\n“Huh? No…? This hand was meant to scratch my head.”\nBaek-seo, with her usual gentle smile, straightened up.\nHer lips twitched intermittently. The way she clutched the clipboard tightly suggested she was tense.\n“Good thing. If you had done that, I wouldn’t have been able to stand it.”\n“?”\nUnable to stand it?\nOh.\n‘Was it that cringy…?’\nI belatedly realized.\nI had just made some really cringy statements.\nAs I replayed my words, I felt my hands and feet curling.\nThe reason Baek-seo’s hands trembled slightly as she clutched the clipboard must have been because she was trying hard to suppress her cringes.\nSwiftly, Baek-seo turned and moved towards the table, tidying up her belongings.\nHer movements seemed quicker than usual.\n“Leader, I’m done for the day, so I’ll be heading out.”\n“Oh, okay… See you tomorrow.”\n“See you tomorrow.”\nBaek-seo smiled at me once more before leaving the room.\nHer walking speed was faster than usual.\n“…Ugh.”\nI put my hand on my forehead.\nI’m not oblivious.\nThe reason Baek-seo didn’t continue her playful banter and instead quickly left.\nShe was trying to suppress her cringes and not show it.\n‘I should have just said something like ‘you’re competent’ and stopped there….’\nI meant to give a simple answer but ended up being too honest.\nToday, it might have tarnished the image Baek-seo had of me.",

      "content": "Chapter 8 – Rule 6. The Leader Excludes Attention Seekers (1)\n“Subscribe, like, and turn on notifications! Please press the button~.”\nAs I roamed the campus, I occasionally spotted students either broadcasting or filming videos.\nFor instance, a male student sitting by the fountain, chatting with a selfie stick-connected smartphone, or a female student dancing in front of a smartphone near the central steps of the school plaza.\nThey continued their broadcasts or recordings, seemingly indifferent to the passing students’ stares.\n“They’re probably shooting a JTube video.”\nHa Yesong, who was in charge of monitoring public morals, said while walking beside me. Oh Baek-seo was also with us.\n“There seems to be more of them lately. It wasn’t this prevalent last year.”\n“A student from our school caused a sensation. It’s the JTube era now, you know?”\n“Really?”\nJTube.\nThe name of the video platform popular among students.\nAnyone could upload videos, and with enough popularity, they could earn revenue. Donations also brought in significant income.\nHowever, I generally avoided JTube videos.\nI was well aware of the risks of addictive videos.\nTo maintain my dignity as the Disciplinary Committee Leader, I needed to regulate my brain’s homeostasis. In simple terms, I prioritized maintaining a healthy dopamine system to maximize academic achievement.\nTherefore, I didn’t know who the student that Yesong mentioned, who had sparked the JTube craze at Ahsung High, was.\n“Our dear Vice President would make a fortune if she started a talk show….”\nI agreed.\nIf a graceful and beautiful girl like our Vice-Leader started a talk show, even my wallet would open without resistance.\n“I’m not interested, really,”\nBaek-seo said with a smile, waving her hand.\n“But who’s the one who started this craze?”\n“ShinsoTV. The ‘Sindo-rim Swordmaster’!”\nYesong answered proudly, like a mother boasting about her child.\n‘Sindo-rim Swordmaster?’\nIsn’t that name… a bit tacky?\nThere are cool nicknames like Sword Saint or Sword Demon, so why that…?\n“There’s also the second most popular, MushRoom. He’s called ‘MuBu.’”\n“Oh, I see….”\nHearing the name of the second most popular person made me stop thinking about it.\nFor a while, Yesong joyfully talked about the Sindo-rim Swordmaster.\nApparently, he gained rapid popularity by showcasing high-level swordsmanship and sword dances to thrilling music alongside his comrades.\n“You should check it out. It’s really cool. He’s recently become my top boyfriend candidate.”\nIt was just after lunch, a lazy time. We were taking a walk for this reason.\nSo, watching it out of boredom seemed fine.\n“Alright, let’s have a look.”\nWe sat on a secluded bench.\nYesong played a video on her smartphone and showed it to me. Her eyes sparkled with anticipation of my reaction. I ignored her and watched the video.\nThe intro began with a male student wearing a goblin mask performing a sword dance to impressive music.\n‘Is this the Sindo-rim Swordmaster?’\nIt was indeed cool.\nPassed the first romantic test.\nIn the main video, the boy from the intro greeted the viewers.\n─ Hello, viewers! This is the Sindo-rim Swordmaster, ShinsoTV!\nHis voice was altered.\nAlthough he was wearing the Ahsung High uniform, his name tag was removed, so his identity was unknown.\nHe continued with light chit-chat after his broadcast greeting.\nIt wasn’t particularly entertaining, but his wit was decent, and his altered voice was likely appealing to the ladies.\nSoon, Shinso began the main sword dance.\nIn a dimly lit room, with background music reminiscent of an anime battle scene.\nShinso wrapped his sword in magical energy.\nWhoosh!\nThe magic transformed into ‘fire.’\nElemental transformation of magic.\nA technique achievable only by those who had reached at least the fourth tier.\nAbilities were categorized from tier 1 to tier 9, with tier 4 being considered at least upper-middle tier within the Academy City.\n‘Oh.’\nPerforming a sword dance with a flaming sword.\nImpressive.\nPassed the second romantic test.\nThe fire-clad blade slashed through the darkness in sync with the music, creating a spectacular display.\nShinso’s movements were graceful and smooth, with a touch of discipline.\nDuring highlight scenes, the sword dance dramatically slowed down. Using slow motion to enhance the impact of these moments.\nShinso’s sword dance was captivating. I could see why he was popular. Things that you can mindlessly watch and get hooked on are always the most addictive.\n‘It looks flashy, but he seems to have a good sense of practical combat too.’\nIt was clear that Shinso was intentionally performing a flashy sword dance. His pre-moves in each moment suggested that he was skilled in real combat.\nEventually, the video ended.\n“Hehe.”\nYesong eagerly awaited my reaction, as if she were showing off her boyfriend.\nWell, she did say he was her top boyfriend candidate.\n“…Not bad. It’s flashy.”\nThat was all I said.\nYesong, expecting more, showed her disappointment.\n“Huh? That’s it?”\n“What more do you want?”\n“Aren’t you impressed?”\n“I was impressed internally.”\n“…Leader, please don’t ever start a reaction channel.”\nYesong pouted.\nWhy…?\nAfter watching the Sindo-rim Swordmaster video Yesong showed me, I lost interest.\nAnd then one day.\nSomething happened.\n[Lee Se-ah: Senior! Did you see the latest Shinso video?]\n[Lee Se-ah: It’s causing a stir!]\n[Lee Se-ah: (laughing cat emoji)]\n[Ahn Woo-jin: ?]\nLee Se-ah, the girl destined to become a Great Villain (Geoak), sent me a message on CoconutTalk.\n‘Shinso?’\nShinso, as in Sindo-rim Swordmaster?",

      "content": "Chapter 8 (Continued)\nWhy is it causing a stir, and why is she telling me?\nJust as I was pondering this, another message came in.\n[Ha Yesong: Leader!!!]\n[Ha Yesong: Big news!!!]\n[Ha Yesong: Check out the latest Shinso video!!]\n[Ha Yesong: It’s huge!!]\nEven Ha Yesong was excited.\n‘What is it?’\nI accessed JTube on my smartphone and went to ShinsoTV. There was a new video uploaded early this morning, which seemed unrelated to his usual sword dances.\nThe title was ‘To the Ahsung High Disciplinary Committee Leader.’\nIn the current Academy City, if someone referred to the “Ahsung High Disciplinary Committee Leader,” it was obviously me.\nI clicked on the video immediately.\nIn the video, the male student in the goblin mask, Shinso, greeted the camera and began to speak.\n─ I am pursuing strength. I envision a future where I will be called the ‘Sword Saint.’\nTo achieve that, I believe I must challenge strong opponents and build my legend.\n‘Ah.’\nI could guess what he was going to say.\nPlease.\nWe haven’t even met yet; don’t do this….\n─ Ahsung High School Disciplinary Committee Leader!\nSure enough, Shinso uttered the name that should not be spoken.\n─ From the first day of the semester, you protected many students from an armed group that hijacked the subway. You may not know how deeply I was moved by your heroics.\nI don’t care.\n─ Moreover, you command the famous genius, Vice President Oh Baek-seo. I can’t even fathom how incredible you must be! So, I earnestly wish to have a match with you. Please, teach me a lesson! I beg you!\nShinso respectfully bowed his upper body.\nIn the end, he said the dreaded line.\n‘What lesson? Is this a martial arts world?’\nShinso’s challenge video, no, his challenge letter, was rapidly climbing the real-time trending video rankings. No, it was soaring.\nViewers showered the video with countless likes.\nThe comments were going wild.\nWhile some students criticized Shinso for suddenly challenging me, most were eagerly anticipating a match between me and Shinso.\nNaturally.\nPeople always seek exciting entertainment.\nAnd if that entertainment is linked to their daily lives, the interest magnifies even more.\n‘What a selfish jerk.’\nI was annoyed.\nThis attention-seeker pursued only sensationalism and his own self-fulfillment, completely disregarding my wishes. It was clear he had thought about this extensively, but if this was the result, all I could offer was a stream of expletives.\nGiven how much attention this had garnered, it was hard to ignore it now. Shinso had probably anticipated this.\nDamn attention-seeker.\nThis has become troublesome….\nMoreover, Shinso praised me as the ‘famous genius Oh Baek-seo’s leader.’ He might have had pure intentions, but this essentially touched my sore spot.\n‘There are still many members who are dissatisfied with me being the leader….’\nAlthough my heroics during the subway incident on the first day had lessened the skepticism towards me, quite a few second and third-year members still questioned my capabilities.\nI had planned to gradually build my track record and quell those doubts, but Shinso had just reignited them.\n“Leader.”\nWhile I was deep in thought, Oh Baek-seo called me.\nA faint scent of tea filled my nostrils.\nShe had quietly placed a warm cup of tea on my desk.\n“What are you going to do about him?”\n“Shinso?”\nBaek-seo nodded.\nShe wore her usual gentle smile, but the atmosphere felt different, colder.\n“Do you want me to handle it?”\n“Huh?”\nBaek-seo spoke calmly, yet firmly.\n“You don’t need to deal with such a nuisance. It’s obvious the match will be recorded, so I’ll warn him that any further challenges will be met with severe penalties. We have the regulations and precedents to back it up.”\nBaek-seo’s voice was gentle but resolute.\nIt seemed she too was annoyed by Shinso’s challenge.\nHowever.\n“That won’t do.”\n“What?”\nI knew she was suggesting this out of concern for me, but following her suggestion would lead to complications.\n‘If I let the Vice-Leader handle this….’\nIt would be fine if most members regarded me as a suitable leader for the Disciplinary Committee. However, in the current situation, delegating this to the Vice President would only highlight her authority.\nMy authority as the Disciplinary Committee Leader would be overshadowed by the Vice President’s.\n‘That can’t happen…!’\nI couldn’t allow that.\nI had worked too hard to get to this position.\n“I’ll do it.”\nIn fact, this might turn out well.\nI could potentially use Shinso’s proposal to my advantage.\n‘If I overwhelm him, it could actually improve my image within the Disciplinary Committee.’\nI didn’t know how strong Shinso was, but it was definitely another opportunity to showcase my skills to the Disciplinary Committee.\n…Well.\nThis might just be a justification I’m coming up with.\n“There’s no need for you to step up….”\n“It’s just that he annoys me. So, I’ll handle it.”\nHonestly, I was just annoyed.\nI wanted to personally teach this disrespectful junior a lesson.\n“Hm…. Alright. Let’s do that.”\nBaek-seo responded with a kind smile.\n* * *\nUnder ShinsoTV’s challenge video, Woo-jin’s comment was posted.\nIt stated that he accepted the challenge.\n“The Ahsung High Disciplinary Committee Leader has accepted Shinso’s challenge.”\nAt Mayeon High School, which was known as Ahsung High’s rival,\ntheir Disciplinary Committee Leader, Lee Jae-ho, adjusted his glasses with a stern expression after hearing the report from his Vice President.\n“The Ahsung High Disciplinary Committee Leader… That’s the guy who became the leader over Oh Baek-seo, the famous genius, right?”\nLast year, Lee Jae-ho was certain that the 45th Disciplinary Committee Leader of Ahsung High would be the genius Oh Baek-seo.\nHowever, the result was different.\nAn unexpected male student had taken the position over Oh Baek-seo.\nThat student was Ahn Woo-jin, the 45th Disciplinary Committee Leader.\n“This is getting interesting. Finally, I can analyze what kind of guy Ahn Woo-jin is.”\nShinso, who Ahn Woo-jin had to face, was known to be a tier 4 or higher in skill.\nTop-tier fighters within the academy, like Lee Jae-ho, had already analyzed Shinso’s videos.\nSo, this match would be a perfect opportunity to gauge the abilities of the 45th Disciplinary Committee Leader of Ahsung High, Ahn Woo-jin.\nBut they weren’t the only ones interested.\n“Repeat that. The Ahsung High Disciplinary Committee Leader is going to duel Shinso? You mean that JTuber?”\n“That’s great. I’ve been curious about how skilled the head of discipline at Aseong High School is.”\n“Now we can finally confirm his skills properly.”\nMost of the academies with autonomy in Neo Seoul showed interest in the news of the public duel between An Woo-jin and Shin So.\nAt some point, the duel between the two became the biggest topic in the academy city.",

      "content": "Chapter 9 – Rule 6. The Leader Excludes Attention Seekers (2)\nThe day of the duel arrived.\nI submitted the duel application to the school and brought along a healer. They were waiting right in front of the dueling arena.\nNaturally, the duel between me and the Sindo-rim Swordmaster caused quite a stir. There were so many students from Ahsung High School that the spectator seats were overflowing.\nI figured this out by watching the live broadcast on JTube.\n‘140,000 viewers…!?\nWhat the hell is this…?’\nI expected a lot of spectators, but I didn’t expect it to be this many….\nThe live broadcast on ShinsoTV had nearly 140,000 viewers. The duel hadn’t even started yet, and neither Sindo-rim nor I had made an appearance, so the number of viewers was bound to surge once it began.\n“All eyes are on us. Other schools will be watching too.”\nVice President Oh Baek-seo said while looking at his smartphone.\n“The Disciplinary Committee Leader from Mayeon High is sponsoring this! That ‘Dark Cloud General’! Oh wow, even the Student Council President of Saein High is supporting us! Big names are backing both you and Shindo-rim!”\n“I-Is that so…?”\nOfficer Ha Yesong laughed foolishly while looking at her smartphone.\n‘Sponsorship? Why are they making it so obvious!?’\nI felt like screaming. I never expected things to get this big.\nThe Disciplinary Committee Leader from Mayeon High?\nThe Student Council President of Saein High?\nWhat’s next?\nIs the Hanyang Federal Academy watching too?\n“Leader! The Hanyang Federal Academy’s Student Council just posted in the chat! They’re wishing for a good duel!”\n‘This is a complete disaster….’\nThere’s no way those guys are watching the duel with pure intentions.\nThey’re probably chomping on popcorn, drooling at the prospect of seeing the Disciplinary Committee Leader of Ahsung High’s weaknesses.\nProving my skills to the Disciplinary Committee is one thing.\nBut I didn’t like the idea of exposing my fighting style to other schools.\n“Don’t they have anything better to do?”\n“What does it matter, it’s great! You’re going to be so famous, Chief, hehe.”\nWhy are you so cheerful about this?\nBefore long, we arrived at the dueling arena. As expected, it was packed with people.\nWe stepped onto the arena amid cheers from the Ahsung High students. At the same time, a fireball flew in and landed right in front of me.\nWhoosh!\nBang!\nAs the flames dispersed, a male student wearing a goblin mask appeared.\nIt was the Sindo-rim Swordmaster.\n‘Impressive….’\nI had to admit it.\nEven before the duel started, I had lost in terms of ‘coolness’.\n“Wow! Amazing!”\n“Sindo-rim! Sindo-rim!”\n“Sindo-rim! I love you!”\n“Sindo-rim! Defeat the Leader!”\nThe students were ecstatic over Sindo-rim’s flashy entrance. Ha Yesong was no different. I couldn’t tell if she was on my side or not.\nTo think his mere entrance could drive people wild.\nIs this what it means to be a JTuber?\nAnyway, it was an utterly unpleasant sight.\nSindo-rim extended his arm towards the audience. Gradually, the students’ voices subsided.\nSeeing him skillfully handle the crowd, I couldn’t help but think, ‘As expected of the Sindo-rim Swordmaster.’\n“Leader, thank you sincerely for accepting my unreasonable request.”\nSindo-rim bowed politely.\n‘So you knew it was an unreasonable request.’\nDespite making such a fuss, he was at least polite about it.\n“Phew.”\nI let out a light breath to calm my emotions and put on my black gloves.\nIt was time to deal with this annoying guy.\n“Name tag.”\n“Pardon?”\nI pointed to the name tag on my chest that read ‘Ahn Woo-jin.’\n“Not wearing your name tag is a violation of school rules. I will deduct points for that. Challenging the Disciplinary Committee is clearly an act of interfering with official duties. You should be punished for that. Also, any profit made from this broadcast will be considered unlawful gains due to illegal activities and will be confiscated by the Disciplinary Committee.”\nI stated the rules.\nThis was the nature of Academy City.\nIn this area governed by Ahsung High School, the school rules were as good as law.\nWhile we must also consider the constitution, fairness, morality, and social justice, the rules I mentioned were valid for now.\n“That’s…!”\nSindo-rim’s voice trembled.\n“I apologize, but please overlook it for this duel! As a challenger, I want to have a match with you, man to man…!”\nPerhaps it was the unexpected cold reality hitting him in the face, but Sindo-rim shouted at me, seemingly hoping I would understand his passionate challenge.\nHis attitude was highly displeasing.\nHe had a top-notch ability to act shamelessly.\nGiven how much attention our duel garnered, he’d be making a handsome amount of pocket money.\nNaturally, he’d be greedy for profits aside from the duel itself.\nReally… what a piece of work.\n“You’re so selfish.”\n“Pardon?”\nI grabbed the brim of my hat and pressed it down slightly, glaring at Sindo-rim.\nEven though I stood here under the pretext of a duel, what I was about to do was anything but a duel.\n“You need some education.”\nMore like discipline.\n“Vice President, why do you think I sponsored ShinsoTV?”\nIn the Disciplinary Committee office of Mayeon High School, Committee Leader Lee Je-ho asked his vice president while watching the live broadcast of ShinsoTV on a tablet.\n“…I’m not interested.”\n“……”\nLee Je-ho shot a glance at the vice president, clearly expecting a response. The vice president sighed silently and asked the question.\n“Yes, Leader. Why did you sponsor them?”\n“To make it known to Ahsung High that our Mayeon High’s Disciplinary Committee is watching.”\nLee Je-ho chuckled softly and adjusted his glasses.\n“If the Sindo-rim Swordmaster turns out to be more skilled than expected and the Ahsung High Disciplinary Committee Leader struggles even a little, or even if he doesn’t struggle but it shows that their combat level is below ours?”\n“In that case, it would imply that Mayeon High’s Disciplinary Committee is stronger than Ahsung High’s, and we can indirectly signal that we’ve noticed. Ultimately, we can gain an upper hand in everyday disputes.”\n“……”\n“Okay, I’ll refrain from explaining for you in the future.”\nThe vice president crushed Lee Je-ho’s plan of a self-question and answer session with a detailed response. Deprived of the chance to show his intellect, Lee Je-ho glared at the vice president once more.\n“In any case… there’s a certain degree of power logic that comes into play between us. Since our ‘school districts’ are adjacent, we inevitably experience conflicts.”\nIn Academy City, the areas over which each school has jurisdiction are called ‘school districts.’\nSince the school districts border each other, it has historically been common for incidents to lead to jurisdictional disputes.\nTherefore, among large schools like Ahsung High, Mayeon High, and Saein High, some degree of power logic was inevitable.\nThus,\n“If we see even a hint of a flaw in Ahsung High’s Disciplinary Committee Leader, he’ll become our prey.”\nLee Je-ho adjusted his glasses and smirked. A sly laugh escaped through the corners of his mouth.\nThe vice president responded dryly, “Yes….” He had no intention of stirring up conflicts with Ahsung High.\n“It’s about to start.”",

      "content": "Chapter 9 (Continued)\nIn the tablet screen, the referee had just stepped onto the dueling arena at Ahsung High.\nWhiz! Sindo-rim drew his dueling sword.\nAlthough it was a blade, it was blunt and closer to a thin cudgel.\n─ Are both of you ready?\nThe referee asked, and Sindo-rim nodded while Woo-jin remained indifferent.\n‘Ahn Woo-jin… Just from his appearance, he’s certainly an extraordinary fellow.’\nThough unsure of his skills, Ahn Woo-jin exuded a noble and imposing aura befitting his position as the Disciplinary Committee Leader.\nA tense atmosphere filled the dueling arena.\nThe students in the audience held their breaths, watching Woo-jin and Sindo-rim.\n─ Then, get ready!\nSindo-rim took his stance.\n─ Begin the duel!\nAt the referee’s declaration, Sindo-rim leaped towards Woo-jin.\n“…!?”\nLee Je-ho’s eyes widened slightly, and his mouth dropped open.\nThe vice president, curious about Lee Je-ho’s reaction, moved behind him to watch the ShinsoTV broadcast together.\n“Oh, shit.”\nThe vice president couldn’t help but utter a common exclamation.\nIt was immediately clear why Lee Je-ho was surprised.\nJust a few minutes earlier, at the dueling arena in Ahsung High School.\nThe Sindo-rim Swordmaster felt a strong sense of intimidation the first time he saw Ahn Woo-jin. His mere presence made the air of the arena heavy.\nWith his striking appearance and shadowed eyes under the brim of his hat, his sharp teal eyes glowed coldly. His gaze was as keen, chilly, and rational as a well-honed blade.\nThere was no trace of hesitation or anxiety. His eyes showed no emotional fluctuation.\nSindo-rim swallowed dryly without realizing it.\nJust as a prey instinctively recognizes a predator, his heart raced, and all his nerves were on edge.\nThus, Sindo-rim was certain.\nThe duel with the Disciplinary Committee Leader would elevate him to the next level.\nSo, he had no choice but to suppress his fear.\n“Begin the duel!”\nAt the referee’s declaration, Sindo-rim charged swiftly.\nMana flowed into Sindo-rim’s dueling sword. Whoosh! Red flames ignited along the blade. It was the skill of a fourth-rank practitioner, the ability to convert mana into elemental power.\nThe burning flames radiated heat, heating the air. The blazing flames trailed behind Sindo-rim like the tail of an Eastern dragon wrapped in fire, creating a spectacular scene.\nMeanwhile, Woo-jin just stood there, coldly watching.\n“I’ll take the first strike!”\nThud! Sindo-rim planted his foot to stabilize his stance. Immediately, the red flames traced a precise trajectory.\nWhoosh!\nThe flames surged forward.\nBut Woo-jin, with a swift motion, leaned back and effortlessly dodged the fiery strike.\n“!”\nSurprise filled Sindo-rim’s eyes.\nIn that moment, something was drawn from Woo-jin’s belt, producing a sharp, slicing sound.\nSwish!\nAs Woo-jin’s weapon darted towards his chin, Sindo-rim reflexively retreated. He realized too late that the range of the weapon was very short.\nIt was a black baton.\nIn other words, a handle.\nWoo-jin tapped the baton-holding arm with his other hand. Click! Two sections of metal rods extended from the baton.\nIt was a black three-section staff.\nCrackle!\nMana flowed into the staff’s circuits, and it took the form of teal lightning.\nNo long thought process was needed. Sindo-rim charged again, the fiery sword slashing through the moment.\nIt was a dazzling dance of flames.\nBut unlike the ‘aesthetic’ sword dance seen in videos, this was a lethal technique meant to defeat the opponent.\nWhoosh! Woo-jin gracefully dodged multiple sword strikes, moving expertly backward.\nSindo-rim concentrated.\nIf this continued, he could push Woo-jin back.\nIf he kept it up, he could land a critical blow on the Disciplinary Committee Leader.\n‘I see it.’\nSuddenly, he saw an opening.\nSindo-rim didn’t miss the moment.\nWhoosh!\nMore mana flowed through the circuits of his dueling sword, igniting even stronger flames.\nThis should allow him to land an effective blow on Woo-jin.\nHe could turn the tide of the duel.\nSindo-rim was confident.\nThwack!\nCrack!\n“!?”\nThe fiery slash failed to even slice through the air.\nA flash of teal light struck Sindo-rim’s wrist. It was a precise attack that exploited the gap in Sindo-rim’s movements.\nImmediately, powerful lightning surged through Sindo-rim’s arm and spread throughout his body.\n“Grrk!”\nSindo-rim’s movements faltered. He dropped his sword. It was difficult to regain his posture due to the electric shock.\nThud!\nThwack!\nTwo teal arcs flashed in the air.\nCrack! The sound of lightning echoed. Sindo-rim had already received a powerful shock to his arm and neck.\n“Argh!”\nWoo-jin’s concise and disciplined movements were like a soldier’s drill, showcasing maximum restraint.\nIt was an attack refined like a well-honed blade, designed to suppress the enemy efficiently.\nWoo-jin raised his arm. Whiz! He swung the three-section staff with force.\nBang!\nWith a sound resembling an explosion, lightning scattered, creating a powerful shockwave.\nWhoosh! Sindo-rim’s body was thrown, skidding across the ground. He stopped just at the edge of the arena, avoiding an out-of-bounds loss.\n“Huff…!”\nSindo-rim panted heavily.\nThe recent bang wasn’t a sound that could be produced by merely swinging a three-section staff.\nThe impact wasn’t something that a simple swing could produce.\n“A shockwave…? How…?”\nClearly, the condensed lightning mana created a shockwave, producing a stronger physical force.\nIt was unbelievable.\nA technique he had never heard of or seen.\nSindo-rim had assessed that Ahn Woo-jin was also a fourth-rank practitioner. He assumed so because Woo-jin only fought by enveloping his three-section staff with lightning mana.\nHe didn’t appear to possess the unique abilities that are a hallmark of the fifth rank.\nOf course, within the fourth rank, there are varying levels of skill.\nHowever, Sindo-rim considered himself skilled enough to fight Woo-jin, who was also fourth-rank, on equal terms.\n…He was wrong.\nWoo-jin’s mana manipulation was far beyond the typical fourth-rank level.\n“……”\nWoo-jin picked up the dueling sword that had fallen to the ground.\nHe casually tossed it back to Sindo-rim.\nClang. The dueling sword landed before Sindo-rim with a clear sound.\nSindo-rim, with a startled expression, looked back and forth between the sword and Woo-jin.\n“Pick it up.”\nWoo-jin’s solemn command resonated.",

      "content": "Chapter 10 – Rule 6. The Leader Excludes Attention Seekers (3)\nAhn Woo-jin.\nFrom a young age, he mastered an efficient mana cultivation technique based on his gaming knowledge.\nWhat is mana cultivation?\nIt’s a training method that refines mana and meticulously crafts mana circuits.\nThe younger one starts, the more depth it adds to their talent, much like aging wine to bring out a deeper, richer flavor.\nOnce the body matures, it only serves to increase the density and operational capability of mana, so timing is crucial.\nAmong these, the method Woo-jin had repeatedly practiced was the training regimen of the strongest in Academy City: the very one instinctively mastered by the worst outlaw among the Six Sinners, ‘Goliath.’\nWoo-jin, equipped with gaming knowledge, poured in effort incomparable to Goliath’s, constantly refining himself like a gem to be cut into a beautiful shape.\nYet, he couldn’t become a monster like Goliath.\nHe didn’t reach the fifth rank like other geniuses.\nThus, Woo-jin considered himself mediocre.\nHowever, the training time Woo-jin accumulated gradually built up.\nThis was an undeniable fact.\nIn the end, Woo-jin’s talent, potential, and skill—all of it—had reached a level far beyond what the Sindorim Swordmaster, who only possessed decent talent, could ever hope to achieve.\nWoo-jin’s teal eyes were cold as ice.\nOccasionally, currents of electricity flowed through his glaring eyes, a sign of activated mana.\n“Grrr…!”\nSindo-rim couldn’t stay still any longer.\nHe picked up his sword and barely managed to stand, assuming a combat stance once more. Whoosh! Red flames again erupted along the blade, driven by his will.\n“Argh!”\nWith his mana-enhanced, robust body, Sindo-rim charged at Woo-jin, letting out a battle cry.\nHis movements were swift. He accelerated his pace by propelling himself with fiery mana.\nWhoosh! A sharp downward slash aimed at Woo-jin.\nAt that moment, Woo-jin released the lightning mana imbued in his three-section staff, leaving only the effects of simple mana enhancement.\nTo prevent an explosive reaction when fire and lightning collided.\nClang!\nWoo-jin blocked the slash with his three-section staff. Swish. He immediately released the staff, which naturally landed in his other hand as it dropped.\nCrackle! Teal currents surged once more through the staff.\nWhack! Thud!\n“Gah!”\nThe electrified staff struck Sindo-rim’s body. It was a swift and precise attack.\nThe mana-enhanced three-section staff was far superior to the mana-enhanced body of Sindo-rim.\nAs a result, Woo-jin’s moderate strike far surpassed Sindo-rim’s defense.\nOne more time.\nWoo-jin struck Sindo-rim again.\nBang!\nA powerful blow created a shockwave, sending Sindo-rim flying. His robust body was rendered useless in that moment.\nCrackle! The residual impact spread teal lightning through the air like chains, leaving an afterglow.\n“Ah, agh…!”\nThe deafening explosion that filled the arena gave the spectators a sense of the immense pain Sindo-rim was experiencing.\n“Huff, huff…!”\nSindo-rim groaned in pain, supporting himself on the ground.\nAt the start of the duel, Sindo-rim was burning with a spirit of challenge.\nEven if it meant troubling Woo-jin, it was a chance he had seized.\nHe had vowed that dueling Woo-jin would provide meaningful combat experience and growth.\nBut.\nAfter exchanging blows twice, the enormous wall obscured by fog finally came into view.\nThe difference in skill was overwhelmingly clear.\nMana control, combat sense—everything was excessively superior.\nSindo-rim had never fought against someone this powerful.\nWas he really just a second-year student?\nBefore the duel, Sindo-rim had his doubts. Perhaps Woo-jin had used connections or cunning to outmaneuver Oh Baek-seo and become the Disciplinary Committee Leader.\nSeeing is believing, as they say.\nAfter confronting him, he could feel it unmistakably.\nWoo-jin was already a genius monster, a different league altogether.\nThus, he realized.\nAhn Woo-jin was an invincible opponent, not even suitable for gaining experience points.\nThe mere fact that he challenged him might have been arrogance.\n“Ah…!”\nCrack! The goblin mask shattered from the impact and fell to the ground.\nFinally, Sindo-rim’s true face was revealed.\n“Huh!? Sindo-rim’s mask…?”\n“Hey, isn’t that Park Sung-tae?”\n“Park Sung-tae? That third-year from the Chrysanthemum Hall?”\n“I knew it! It was Park Sung-tae! I was right!”\nThe audience murmured.\nThe true identity of the Sindo-rim Swordmaster was exposed.",

      "content": "Chapter 10.2 (Continued)\nPark Sung-tae.\nA third-year student at Ahsung High, known for his high grades among the gathered prodigies.\nHis face showed no trace of the challenger’s bravado.\nOnly shock filled his expression.\n“Damn it….”\nPark Sung-tae propped himself up on the ground.\nHis body refused to move as he willed it.\nHe had endured multiple shocks and electric attacks, enough to knock anyone unconscious.\nYet, Sung-tae struggled to rise.\nThere was another reason he had challenged Woo-jin. This duel wasn’t just about gaining meaningful combat experience.\nSung-tae had always considered himself a genius.\nHe believed that his outstanding talent had allowed him to achieve high grades even within Ahsung High School.\nHowever, the spotlight always shone on his juniors.\nEspecially on Oh Baek-seo, an unparalleled genius, and Ahn Woo-jin, who had surpassed him to become the Disciplinary Committee Leader.\nHe acknowledged the difference in talent.\nBut Sung-tae wasn’t willing to accept being considered mediocre.\nHe had resolved to use another genius as experience points to rise above.\nOnly then…\n‘I must defeat him to prove myself….’\nHe wanted to show the audience that his belief in his own talent was not misplaced.\nSung-tae managed to stand up and took his sword again. Whoosh! The flames responded to his call once more.\n“He’s pretty tough….”\n“Does he really need to go this far, though? Doesn’t seem like it.”\n“The Disciplinary Committee Leader is amazing, isn’t he? Sindo-rim doesn’t stand a chance.”\n“I didn’t expect it to be this bad…. How is his mana control like that…?”\nThe audience started praising Ahn Woo-jin.\nTheir interest in Sindo-rim waned rapidly as his identity was revealed and the duel turned one-sided.\nBut Sung-tae focused solely on Ahn Woo-jin.\nHe couldn’t hear the murmurs of the audience with the towering wall right in front of him.\nClick, clack.\nWoo-jin walked forward.\nHis steps were resolute.\nSindo-rim instinctively held his breath.\n“If you’re my senior, I should have shown more respect.”\nWoo-jin spoke in a monotone voice.\n“I’ll stop holding back now. Let’s finish this quickly.”\n“……!”\nSung-tae’s eyes widened.\n“You mean, you haven’t been serious at all…?”\n“Unfortunately, senior, you’re not an opponent worth my serious effort.”\n“Grr…!”\nPark Sung-tae gritted his teeth.\n“Don’t be ridiculous!”\nSung-tae charged at Woo-jin again with a fierce cry.\nThud!\nWhat followed was the expected conclusion.\nSung-tae’s sword strike was effortlessly deflected, and the electrified three-section staff plunged into his body.\nTeal arcs flashed through the air, accompanied by five rapid, dull impacts. Crackle! The lightning mana enhanced the strikes with greater force.\n‘What…?’\nSung-tae couldn’t comprehend what was happening.\nThe audience watched in shock, mouths agape.\nBang!\nWith a final swing of Woo-jin’s three-section staff, a booming sound echoed as Sung-tae was sent flying out of the arena.\nWhoosh! The wind pressure spread. As his hat threatened to fly off, Woo-jin caught it and put it back on.\nCrash! Sung-tae hit the wall and collapsed, unconscious.\nFor a moment, silence filled the arena. Woo-jin stood quietly, watching Sung-tae.\n“D-d-d-d-duel over…!”\nThe referee’s shout broke the silence.\n“The winner is Disciplinary Committee Leader Ahn Woo-jin!”\nStudents who had been in a daze started clapping one by one.\nHealers administered basic healing magic to Sung-tae and carried him away on a stretcher.\nRumble. Woo-jin wiped the blood off the three-section staff with a handkerchief, retracted the metal rods, and reattached it to his belt. Adjusting his hat, he extended his hand to the referee.\n“Um…? Would you like to say a few words…?”\nWoo-jin took the microphone from the referee without responding.\nHe spoke towards the camera filming the duel.\n“I hereby declare: any student who issues another challenge to the Disciplinary Committee will be severely punished according to school regulations. Please take note.”\nWoo-jin’s voice was solemn.\nAfter delivering his warning, he returned the microphone to the referee and stepped off the arena.\nThe referee and audience watched his back in stunned silence.\n“Goodness… he’s something else.”\nIn the audience, Lee Se-Ah smiled brightly.\nShe had known he was strong, being the Disciplinary Committee Leader and the one who single-handedly quelled the subway incident….\nBut she hadn’t expected this level of power.\nWatching the duel, she felt a constant chill.\nConsidering his mana level and combat sense, Woo-jin had long surpassed the typical fourth rank.\nThough he didn’t possess a unique ability to qualify for the fifth rank, evaluating Woo-jin’s strength solely based on rank was misleading.\nSe-Ah’s desire to have Woo-jin grew stronger.\nIf she could recruit him, he would undoubtedly become a formidable ally.\n“Yesong, why aren’t you going to your boyfriend candidate?”\n“I’ve always disliked that senior. I was fooled by the mask. He’s out of the running….”\nWoo-jin left the arena with Vice President Oh Baek-seo and Officer Ha Ye-song.\nAt this moment.\nIn front of the city’s big names who were watching, Woo-jin established himself as an ‘unknown powerhouse.’\n…\nA woman watched the duel between Woo-jin and Sindo-rim on Jtube.\nIt was a video she had replayed countless times.\nShe paused the video and enlarged the screen, gently caressing Woo-jin’s cheek with her finger. The screen moved with her finger’s motion.\nThe sensation under her fingertip was that of the hard screen, not Woo-jin’s soft skin.\n“He’s gotten so strong, Woo-jin. This much….”\nKim Dalbi smiled contentedly, continuing to gaze at Woo-jin.",

      "content": "Chapter 11 – Rule 7: The Leader Does Not Concern himself with Black Day\nThe primary difference between the Old Humanity and the New Humanity lies in their magical responsiveness. While most of the Old Humanity struggled with even basic levels of magic despite awakening to it, the New Humanity could manipulate magic as effortlessly as breathing.\nMagic is a mysterious energy that flows within the body, enhancing living beings and transforming them into stronger entities. This strength is categorized into the ‘Nine Tiers.’\n1st Tier.\nAt this level, individuals possess magic but cannot wield its power. This term also describes ordinary people. The New Humanity does not fall under this category.\n2nd Tier.\nThis level can enhance physical abilities using magic. Depending on their skill, they might withstand gunfire or anti-aircraft guns. This is the starting point for the New Humanity.\n3rd Tier.\nThis level can channel magic into objects with built-in magic circuits, augmenting their functionality or hardness.\n4th Tier.\nThis level can convert magic into the power of a single element while maintaining the magic’s enhancement effects. The element that can be converted depends on the innate nature of the magic.\n5th Tier.\nThis level has awakened a ‘Unique Ability,’ a special power that only one individual can use. Those who reach the 5th Tier are considered geniuses.\n6th Tier.\nThis level can simultaneously use a Unique Ability and elemental power, requiring excellent magic manipulation skills.\n7th Tier.\nThis level’s Unique Ability becomes powerful enough to cause calamities. Those who reach the 7th Tier instil fear in the world just by their name.\n8th Tier.\nThis level reshapes heaven and earth. Among humans, the modern ‘Argonauts’ who once set out to subdue the Golden Sheep fall under this Tier. However, they all died in defeat to the Golden Sheep.\n9th Tier.\nThis level refers exclusively to the ‘Golden Sheep.’ The Golden Sheep is an entity that has achieved the pinnacle of magic and is sometimes regarded as a god. No one but the Golden Sheep is expected to reach this Tier.\nThe concept of the Nine Tiers is based on the observed existence of these entities.\n“Ultimately, it’s the 4th Tier.”\nAfter watching the sparring video, several academies evaluated the Disciplinary Committee Leader of Ahsung High School.\n“He seems strong in personal combat, but in an actual fight, he might be weaker than us. After all, he’s only at the 4th Tier.”\n“How can we judge based on that brief spar? However, he does seem strong.”\n“His skills are considerable, but… it’s still hard to say for sure.”\nThey acknowledged Ahn Woo-jin’s combat abilities but remained uncertain about whether he was suitable as the Disciplinary Committee Leader over Oh Baek-seo.\nHowever, it was still difficult to gauge the full extent of Woo-jin’s unrevealed ‘capabilities.’ They remained cautious of him.\nMeanwhile.\n“So, the Disciplinary Committee Leader of Ahsung High is at the 4th Tier…”\nMayeon High School’s Disciplinary Committee Leader, Lee Jae-ho, muttered as he adjusted his glasses. His Vice, who also wore glasses, stroked his chin and replied.\n“For a 4th Tier, he’s exceptionally strong.”\n“Vice, this isn’t something that can be measured just by the fact that he’s at the 4th Tier.”\n“Pardon?”\nLee Jae-ho remained in a state of surprise.\nHis ability to manipulate magic was superior to my own. His dazzling combat style was on an astounding level, akin to an agent from the Federation Council’s Black Ops performing covert operations within Academy City.\n“Well, yes. I’ve never seen anyone this formidable in personal combat. It’s surprising that someone like this is still at the 4th Tier.”\n“Perhaps.”\nLee Jae-ho leaned back in his chair and sipped his hot espresso.\n“He might have achieved many accomplishments while staying at the 4th Tier due to hitting an early wall of talent.”\n“Is that possible? That the wall of talent is so high?”\n“It’s possible.”\nLee Jae-ho leaned back in his chair.\n“If the conditions to acquire a new Unique Ability are exceptionally difficult. In other words, if his potential is at an insane level…”\nIf Woo-jin manages to break through the wall of the 5th Tier.\nHe might become a monster beyond the term genius.\n“He might not be much now, but he’s definitely not someone to be taken lightly.”\nLee Jae-ho also considered Woo-jin’s potential.\nPerhaps Ahsung High’s decision to appoint Ahn Woo-jin as the Disciplinary Committee Leader instead of Oh Baek-seo was appropriate, he thought.\n“Hmm… So, you’re saying it’s favorable. That’s a relief.”\n“What?”\nSuddenly, the Vice handed a document to Lee Jae-ho.\n“Vice, what’s this?”\n“It’s a proposal for an exchange meeting with Ahsung High’s Disciplinary Committee.”\n“?”\nLee Jae-ho looked at the Vice with a puzzled face. His eyes showed confusion.\n“Mayeon High’s Disciplinary Committee and Ahsung High’s Disciplinary Committee have not been on good terms. This proposal aims to foster friendship starting this year. ‘Peace forever,’ they say.”\n“What the…! Do you think I’ll approve such a thing, Vice!?”\n“This proposal came under the Student Council President’s directive. Who knows, if you handle this well, the President might favor you…”\nScratch!\nLee Jae-ho signed the approval line without hesitation.\nThe Vice naturally retrieved the document.\n“Yes, it’s approved.”\n“Grrr…. Listen carefully, Vice. I only signed because it was the Student Council President’s directive… I would never get friendly with the Ahsung High Disciplinary Committee even if Neo Seoul were to collapse…!”\nLee Jae-ho’s face turned red and blue in no time. He grasped the pen with trembling hands, solidifying his resolve.\n“Yes, I understand. Well noted.”\nThe Vice nodded nonchalantly.\nCurrently, the student council president of Mayeon High School was Lee Jae-ho’s adopted sister.\nHe respected his sister deeply and sought her recognition.\n…to put it nicely.\nLee Jae-ho was a sister complex, unable to refuse any of her requests and drooling over her photo every day.\n“Then I’ll submit this approved document to the student council. Since it’s under the student council president’s directive, the approval should be quick, so I’ll notify Ahsung High in advance.”\n“Grrr…”\nLee Jae-ho’s body trembled with frustration.\n* * *\n“Leader, the views are off the charts!”\nApril 14th, in the Disciplinary Committee’s office.\nHa Yesong cheerfully shouted as she held up her smartphone.\n“As expected, you’re a goldmine, Leader!”\n“Isn’t that an odd way to put it?”\n“It’s my way of praising you. Not everyone can be profitable, you know? Unless they sell their organs or something.”\nThat’s an inappropriate expression.\n“Ha Yesong, as a Disciplinary Committee member, you should refrain from such immoral expressions.”\n“Hehe, sorry about that.”\n“Well… there’s no reason to be happy. All the revenue generated from that video will go to the student council anyway.”\n“Still, if we’re going to milk it, it feels better to squeeze out as much as we can, right?”\n“That’s totally the mindset of a predatory loan shark…”\nCalling her a mosquito might also be apt.\n“Besides, we’re not even sure if we’ll be able to confiscate it yet.”\n“That’s true.”\nThe revenue generated from the sparring video with the Sindo-rim Swordmaster was to be confiscated by the Disciplinary Committee, as it was considered illicit profit due to illegal activities.\nThus, Sindo-rim was in a position where he had to hand over the revenue generated from the sparring video to us every month until graduation.\nIn the end, Sindo-rim filed a constitutional appeal against this regulation with the academic court.\nHaving already discarded their pride, their resolve was quite impressive.\nEventually, the revenue confiscation was fully suspended until the constitutionality was determined.\nIf the decision was constitutional, Sindo-rim would have to pay back all the unpaid revenue.\nIf it was deemed unconstitutional, the confiscation would be canceled, and the regulation would disappear, but I didn’t care. Since the confiscated money would go to the student council anyway, I had no vested interest. Only Sindo-rim would be troubled with proving the unconstitutionality.\nDing.\n“Hmm?”\nA text notification sounded from Yesong’s school uniform pocket. She immediately checked her smartphone.\nTL Note –\nOur MC, Ahn Woo-jin is not the student council President. He is the disciplinary committee Leader. This was my misconception due to previous translator translated him as a student council president. I have corrected all errors in previous chapters.",

      "content": "Chapter 11 (Continued)\n“Leader, I’m going to eat jjajangmyeon with the Gourmet Club members.”\nThe Gourmet Club was a food exploration club that Yesong was part of in addition to the Disciplinary Committee.\n“Jjajangmyeon?”\n“Today, we have to eat jjajangmyeon. It’s a significant matter!”\n“?”\nNot ‘want to eat,’ but ‘have to eat’?\nAh, maybe she just phrased her desire differently.\n“Enjoy your meal, Leader!”\nYesong left the office with a bounce in her step.\n‘Jjajangmyeon, huh… Now that I hear it, I want some too.’\nCome to think of it, it’s been a while since I had jjajangmyeon.\nI decided to order it for lunch.\nI pulled out my smartphone to order jjajangmyeon via the delivery app.\nJust then, my phone vibrated with a message on CoconutTalk.\nIt was a message from Vice_ Leader Oh Baek-seo.\n[Oh Baek-seo: Leader]\n[Oh Baek-seo: Have you had lunch?]\nBaek-seo’s profile picture on Cocotalk was the back view of her in a hanbok in a flower garden.\nEven through CoconutTalk, she exuded elegance.\n[Ahn Woo-jin: I was just about to order]\n[Ahn Woo-jin: What about you?]\n[Oh Baek-seo: Not yet]\n[Ahn Woo-jin: Let’s eat together]\n[Oh Baek-seo: Sure]\n[Oh Baek-seo: Sounds good, haha]\n[Oh Baek-seo: (Cat laughing emoji)]\n[Ahn Woo-jin: Come to the office]\n[Ahn Woo-jin: Is jjajangmyeon okay?]\n[Oh Baek-seo: ?]\nWhat’s with the question mark?\n[Oh Baek-seo: Really?]\nWhat does she mean by ‘really’?\n[Oh Baek-seo: I like it]\nOh, just an exclamation, I guess.\n[Ahn Woo-jin: Jja? Jjam?]\n[Oh Baek-seo: Jjajangmyeon]\n[Ahn Woo-jin: Got it]\n[Ahn Woo-jin: (OK sign dog emoji)]\n[Oh Baek-seo: I’ll be there soon, hehe]\nI ordered two bowls of jjajangmyeon and a tangsuyuk set from the delivery app.\nSoon, Baek-seo arrived at the office, and 10 minutes later, the jjajangmyeon set was delivered.\nAfter setting the food on the table, Baek-seo and I sat on the sofa.\n‘Oh, the smell is amazing.’\nThe aroma of jjajangmyeon I hadn’t smelled in a while was very stimulating.\nMy mouth watered.\n“You ordered tangsuyuk too?”\n“Do you not like tangsuyuk?”\n“Not at all. I love it.”\nBaek-seo shook her head, smiling gently as always.\nI rubbed the wooden chopsticks in my hands to warm them up. Then, with a bit of force, they split perfectly in half.\n…Wait a second.\n‘Oops.’\nHad the act of heating the wooden chopsticks through palm friction been unrefined?\nNo, it was within acceptable limits. The purpose was to precisely split the chopsticks using a scientific principle. It was a logical and reasonable action.\n‘I should maintain my dignity even while eating jjajangmyeon.’\nThat was the appropriate demeanor expected of a Disciplinary Committee Leader.\nThankfully, I became aware in time. I almost shook the packaged jjajangmyeon to mix it, which would have been undignified. At least, it wasn’t something to do in front of the Vice.\nAfter removing the plastic wrap from the jjajangmyeon, I stirred the noodles and sauce with my chopsticks. The white noodles slowly turned black as they absorbed the sauce with a slurping sound.\n‘Yes, this is it.’\nThere was no way that a mere jjajangmyeon could tarnish my dignity, even slightly.\nFinally, I lifted a chopstickful of jjajangmyeon to my mouth. Slurp. A rich, savory flavor with the right balance of salty and sweet burst forth.\n‘This is fantastic.’\nAs I was happily slurping the noodles,\n“Leader.”\n“What?”\n“Why jjajangmyeon all of a sudden? And with me?”\nBaek-seo asked with a smiling face.\nI didn’t understand her intent.\n“I wanted to eat it. And if I’m going to eat, it’s better to eat together.”\n“Is that so…?”\nBaek-seo tucked a strand of hair behind her ear and slurped a few strands of jjajangmyeon. A meaningful smile played on her lips.\n‘What’s this?’\nSomething felt off.\nI suddenly remembered Yesong shouting that she had to eat jjajangmyeon today. Baek-seo seemed to know something as well.\nThere were no significant memories related to jjajangmyeon within the Disciplinary Committee.\nSo then?\nI took out my smartphone and accessed the internet. Upon searching for ‘jjajangmyeon,’ I found information I hadn’t paid attention to before.\nApril 14th.\nBlack Day.\nIt’s a day when men and women who didn’t receive chocolates or candies on Valentine’s Day and White Day gather to eat jjajangmyeon together.\nAll clothes and accessories must be black, and they should drink black coffee at cafes.\nIt’s a day for singles to comfort each other and sometimes become couples.\n“Ah.”\nI finally understood Yesong’s earlier remark and Baek-seo’s reaction.\nToday was April 14th, Black Day.\nIt was coincidental that I decided to have jjajangmyeon today after a long time, and my company was Baek-seo. She might have interpreted my invitation differently.\n[It’s a day when singles become couples.]\nThat particular phrase lingered in my mind.\n‘Should I explain this…?’\nShould I clarify that there was no hidden meaning behind my invitation to eat jjajangmyeon together? No, that would be undignified. It would make me seem desperate and pitiful.\n“Hm…”\nI was lost in thought, forgetting about the jjajangmyeon in front of me.\n“Leader.”\n“Yeah.”\n“The jjajangmyeon is delicious.”\nBaek-seo said with a smile.\n“Shall we make this our regular spot?”\n“……”\nSurprisingly, seeing Baek-seo’s calm smile, my mind cleared instantly.\n‘Well… what does it matter if today is Black Day or not.’\nBaek-seo must have known it was Black Day.\nNormally, Baek-seo would not miss the opportunity to tease me in such a situation. How could she not take advantage of the funny scenario where I invited her to eat jjajangmyeon on Black Day?\nYet, she made no jokes about it.\nThis meant she wasn’t concerned about Black Day.\n‘Paying attention to such things would be childish and undignified. Baek-seo knows this well.’\nMaking a fuss to explain myself would only damage my dignity. I didn’t want to do that anyway.\nI had worried over nothing.\n“It doesn’t matter.”\nI answered with a raised corner of my mouth.\nLater, while eating jjajangmyeon without any particular thoughts,\nBaek-seo quietly munched on a piece of pickled radish and said,\n“Leader, you won’t be eating jjajangmyeon again today, will you?”\n“Probably not.”\n“Then that’s good.”\n?\nSlurp. Baek-seo finished her remaining jjajangmyeon.",

      "content": "Chapter 12 – Rule 8. The Leader Maintains Dignity Even at Exchange Meetings (1)\n“Apparently, the student council president wants us to hold an exchange meeting with Mayeon High’s Disciplinary Committee.”\nI was in the middle of eating an egg mayo sandwich made by Oh Baek-seo when my friend from the student council suddenly mentioned this odd proposal.\n“An exchange meeting with Mayeon High’s Disciplinary Committee?”\n“Yeah.”\nMayeon High School: the school we had the most conflicts with and avoided the most. And now, an exchange meeting?\nIf it were a business partner, we’d need to be polite, but there’s no reason to be on good terms with these guys.\nAs the Disciplinary Committee Leader, I intended to avoid any involvement with them. There’s no need to step in dog poop if you can walk around it.\n“Why the hell?”\n“How should I know? Apparently, it was agreed upon.”\n“Getting friendly with street rats would be more realistic. Aren’t Mayeon High and Ahsung High practically in a cold war?”\n“Honestly, it seems like you won’t be able to refuse. There’s a positive atmosphere about it in the student council.”\nReally?\n“Why?”\n“Our school district and Mayeon High’s district are very closely connected. Continuing to fight is just a game of chicken. If we cut off the exchange meeting too, things will just get more awkward. They probably want to reconcile, at least on the surface, and establish a somewhat peaceful relationship.”\nIf it were any other school, I would welcome it with open arms.\nBut not Mayeon High. Historically, we have fought countless dirty battles and snarled at each other.\nNaturally, I felt resistant.\n“Why do we have to do this? We can just stay awkward with them.”\nSo I argued.\n“Our student council president wants to show some achievements.”\n“Oh…”\nI immediately shut my mouth.\nImproving relations with Mayeon High.\nIf such an achievement were recorded in the school life record under the student council president’s tenure…\nThat would be a very powerful credential.\n“I don’t know what the other student council president’s motive is, but there’s nothing to lose. On the contrary, establishing a friendly relationship on the surface might benefit both sides. Since there hasn’t been any recent conflict, the student council president wants to proceed positively for their and the school’s future. What can we do?”\nIt was a carefree statement.\n“…But the exchange meeting is between the Disciplinary Committees, not the student councils.”\nI’m the one stepping in shit.\n“All conflicts originated from the Disciplinary Committees. The student council presidents will likely meet too, but you have to bear with it. If you handle this well, it’ll be an achievement for you too. If the Mayeon High students act up, just handle them appropriately.”\nI sighed.\nAs the Disciplinary Committee Leader, I couldn’t ignore the student council president’s orders.\n“Who suggested this?”\n“The Mayeon High student council president.”\n“What?”\nThey suggested it first?\n‘Oh, right.’\nI recalled some game information I had noted down. It was information I had forgotten because I didn’t think it was important.\nThe current student council president of Mayeon High was a bright, cheerful girl who seemed to have a field of flowers blooming in her mind.\nShe was always saying “Peace forever, peace.”\nShe prioritized peace and friendship, only considering the school’s interests afterward. You could say she had an altruistic nature.\nI remember being fond of her character in the game because she was exceptionally kind. She just lacked a bit of awareness.\n‘If it’s her, there likely aren’t any shady motives.’\nTherefore, the reason why the Mayeon High student council president wanted to proceed with the exchange meeting was probably because she genuinely wished for her school’s Disciplinary Committee to reconcile with ours.\n‘The problem is their Disciplinary Committee members.’\nThe student council president’s kindness didn’t necessarily reflect the character of the Disciplinary Committee members.\nThe street scum I referred to were not the student council president, but the members of the Mayeon High Disciplinary Committee.\n“Anyway, I’ve told you. Sorry, but bear with it. As I said, if it goes well, you’ll benefit too.”\nMy student council friend patted my shoulder and left.\nDid I have any say in this?\nIf the higher-ups command, I have to comply.\nIf this were an opportunity to build a record of achievements, I’d welcome it.\n…\n“…So that’s how it is.”\nI informed Deputy Oh Baek-seo and officer Ha Yesong about the exchange meeting with Mayeon High’s Disciplinary Committee.\nSince it was the student council president’s directive, the exchange meeting proposal was swiftly and decisively approved.\nThere’s no port to escape the storm.\nUnder these circumstances, the Disciplinary Committee had no choice but to go through with this exchange meeting.\n“Ugh, looks like we’ll have a lot of work to do…”\nYe-song sighed.\nShe worried about preparing for the exchange meeting, not about the confrontation with Mayeon High’s Disciplinary Committee.\nSince she wasn’t interested in the history of conflicts between Ahsung High and Mayeon High, her reaction was understandable.\n“When is it?”\n“In nine days.”\n“My god, why is it so rushed!?”\n“I was just informed about this proposal yesterday, so I have nothing to say.”\n“How could such a big event get approved in just one day?”\n“Because it’s the student council president’s order.”\n“Oh, then I understand.”\nYesong also understood the basic social order that if the higher-ups command, you have to comply.\n“Oh dear…, we’ll have to start preparing right away.”\n“We need to gather the rest of the officers. Since it’s an exchange meeting, all officers must participate.”\nBaek-seo spoke with her usual kind smile on her face.\n“Other executives. That means, the secretary and the treasurer.”\nThe exchange meeting with Mayeon High School is an important event. We need to start preparing immediately. Thus, it was necessary to assemble the five executive parts in one place for an executive assembly.\n“I’ll call the treasurer.”\n“I’ll handle Minhyuk!”\nPark Minhyuk was the name of the Disciplinary Committee’s secretary.\nYesong and I each called the executives. …They aren’t picking up.\n“They’re not answering.”\n“Neither are mine. Oh, I got a text.”\n“What does it say?”\nYesong showed the text message to Baek-seo and me.\n[Please do not look for someone like me…]\nHow poignant. It was clear that the low self-esteem secretary, who falls in love easily, was once again heartbroken or feeling self-deprecating.\n“I guess he might be hiding in the trash can, so I’ll go check there.”\nYesong deduced calmly.\n“Alright. Vice-Leader, help Yesong.”\n“Okay.”\n“I’ll go find the treasurer.”\n“Let’s contact each other once we find them!”\nAfter leaving the room, we scattered.\nThe treasurer of Ahsung High’s Disciplinary Committee, ‘Yoo Doha’. Among the students, Doha is humorously called ‘Calculating Ghost’ because she calculates everything before taking action.\nFortunately, there was no participatory class in the class the treasurer belonged to. When she had free time, she usually locked herself in an empty classroom, saying she needed to prove various things.\nShe didn’t stay in one fixed place. She moved to any classroom she liked daily. However, she preferred classrooms with large blackboards, so some classrooms could be excluded.\n“Senior!”\nWhile crossing the schoolyard, a female student called out to me. I stopped and looked over.\n“Lee Se-Ah?”\nThe girl in the black uniform, Lee Se-Ah, ran towards me. A bright smile spread across her face as if she was happy to find me.\n“Where are you headed?”\n“I’m just looking for someone.”\n“That sounds fun! Can I help? I’m a specialist at finding people.”\nSe-Ah showed a confident attitude. She was an expert at everything, it seemed.\n“What about your classes?”\n“I only have BD class left. I have plenty of free time.”\n“Hmm.”\nHaving someone to help was welcome.\nI didn’t assign the task of finding the executives to the Disciplinary Committee members because it would look bad. So, if someone unrelated to the committee helped, it wouldn’t be a problem.\nLee Se-Ah might become a great villain in the Black Market someday, but she wasn’t someone who would bring about the dystopia I feared. Therefore, I had no ill feelings towards her. In fact, having frequent conversations through CoconutTalk made us somewhat close.\nAdditionally, keeping my distance from her would look strange, and there was no reason to distance myself from her anyway. She didn’t seem like someone who would harm the Disciplinary Committee.\nSo, I spoke without hesitation.\n“I’m looking for the Disciplinary Committee treasurer. She looks like this.”\nI showed her a photo of Yoo Doha on my smartphone. Se-Ah nodded.\n“Okay, okay.”\n“She should be in an empty classroom. One with a large blackboard. I’ll search from this direction.”\n“Then I’ll check this line. Let’s contact each other if we find her.”\nSe-Ah waved her smartphone and started backing away before turning towards the classroom building.",

      "content": "Chapter 12 (Continued)\nI quickened my pace in the direction I was heading.\nBuzz.\nAs I walked down the corridor, checking the classrooms, my smartphone vibrated.\n[Lee Se-Ah: Senior]\n[Lee Se-Ah: Found the treasurer!]\n[Lee Se-Ah: (photo)]\n[Lee Se-Ah: She’s in the Chrysanthemum Hall laboratory]\nSe-Ah had secretly taken a picture of a girl writing calculations on the blackboard inside the lab.\nIt was the back of Yoo Doha, the treasurer.\n‘Found her already?’\nThat was fast. Did she use some method? Or just luck?\nIn any case, it was helpful.\n[Ann Woo-jin: Thank you]\n[Ann Woo-jin: (thumbs-up puppy emoji)]\n[Lee Se-Ah: Praise me]\n[Ann Woo-jin: Good job]\n[Lee Se-Ah: lol]\n[Lee Se-Ah: (dancing flying squirrel emoji)]\nI arrived at the entrance of the Chrysanthemum Hall laboratory.\nLeaning against the wall in the corridor, Se-Ah greeted me with a wave. She put her hand to her mouth and whispered softly.\n“She’s completely focused.”\nShe pointed towards the open lab door.\nStanding at the entrance, I saw Yoo Doha deeply absorbed in front of the blackboard. Se-Ah and I each leaned against the doorframe, peeking at Doha.\n“First, I need to decompose these… Then, if I use the complex exponential function here… What a beautiful relationship…! Now, I need to reconstruct these parts…!”\nActing like a mad scientist, Yoo Doha grinned fiercely, scribbling furiously with the chalk.\nThe blackboard was filled with incomprehensible formulas, and I couldn’t understand a word he was saying.\nIn my past life and current life, I was a humanities student. Just looking at the formulas made me feel queasy.\n“Should I bring her over?”\n“Yes. But not yet.”\n“Why not?”\n“She really hates being interrupted when she’s focused. We need to wait until her concentration breaks.”\nIf I interrupted her now, even if Neo Seoul were being destroyed, she would firmly push me away, saying, ‘Do not disturb me at this moment, Woo-jin…!’ At times like these, Doha was like an impregnable fortress.\nThis was an established principle from our first year. I was in charge of bringing the eccentric Yoo Doha from the Disciplinary Committee.\n“Is that so?”\n“Anyway, thanks for finding her. You can go now… Wait, what are you doing?”\nSuddenly, Se-Ah entered the lab. She approached Yoo Doha with her hands behind her back.\n“It’s Fermat’s Last Theorem, right?”\n“!”\nAs soon as a coquettish voice echoed through the lab, Doha flinched. She quickly turned her head and saw Se-Ah.\n“Who are you?”\nDoha looked wary.\n“Do you know that this proof is complete?”\n“Hah!”\nDoha scoffed confidently.\n“You’re asking the obvious. Don’t you think I know Andrew Wiles proved it? But I want to fully understand the process…! The way he proved it, Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, and all those elliptic curves…”\n“Wow, you’re trying to savor the beauty of the proof? That’s amazing.”\n“What?”\nDoha, who was passionately explaining, showed signs of confusion.\n‘Oh?’\nIt was the first time I’d seen Doha react like this.\nSe-Ah smiled slyly.\n“How elliptic curves connect with modular forms? It’s quite an interesting topic.”\n“Isn’t it? That connection is very fascinating…!”\nHuh?\nI didn’t understand their conversation, but it was clear Doha was getting hooked.\nDoha and Se-Ah continued discussing various incomprehensible topics.\nSe-Ah even understood the equations on the blackboard and picked up a piece of chalk, adding her own notes.\nDoha watched with an intrigued expression, nodding in agreement.\n‘What is that?’\nIt was terrifying.\n“Oh, by the way.”\nAfter a short while, Se-Ah spoke.\n“The Disciplinary Committee Leader is here to see you.”\n“The Leader?”\n“Yes, do you have time?”\nSurprisingly, Se-Ah managed to create a natural opportunity for me to step in.\nShe gained Doha’s favor, invaded her territory, and it only took about 2 minutes. Considering my best time was 15 minutes, it was an impressive speed.\n“Leader?”\nDoha tilted her head.\nAnticipating this, I had been leaning against the door frame with my arms crossed, setting the mood.\n“Yoo Doha. Emergency executive meeting. Stop what you’re doing and come with me.”\n“…What’s the matter?”\n“I’ll tell you when we get there.”\n“Hmm.”\nDoha looked back and forth between Se-Ah and the blackboard. Se-Ah was still smiling slyly.\n“Alright, I’ll come with you.”\n……\n“Wow, Leader! You succeeded in bringing the treasurer!”\n“Of course. With a little help.”\n“That’s the shortest time ever! As expected of the Leader!”\nUpon arriving at the room with the treasurer, Yoo Doha, Yesong welcomed me.\nDoha warned, “Don’t treat bringing me as a mission,” but Yesong ignored her, grinning widely.\n“And the secretary?”\n“Over there, overcoming the pain of heartbreak.”\nWhen I opened the cabinet, a startled male student inside exclaimed, “Leader!” It was the secretary, Park Minhyuk.\n“Get out.”\n“Y-Yes…”\nAt my firm command, he lowered his head and stepped out of the cabinet.\n“Leader.”\n“Hmm?”\nSuddenly, Baek-seo approached me. I flinched at the closeness of her face but didn’t show it.\n“Who did you bring the treasurer with?”\nBaek-seo asked in a low, whispering voice.\nIt was chilling. Despite her kind tone, it felt like a cold blade was pressed against my neck.\nI had felt this way before…\n“Why do you ask?”\nBaek-seo stared into my eyes.\n“…It’s nothing. Never mind.”\nShe shook her head with a smile and returned to the sofa.\nWhat was that…?\nIt made me a little nervous.\nIn a scary way.\nAnyway, all five parts of the Disciplinary Committee were gathered in the executive room.\nThe always kind vice-leader, Oh Baek-seo.\nThe male secretary, Park Minhyuk, with leaves in his hair and shoulders slumped in despair.\nThe female treasurer, Yoo Doha, sitting arrogantly with her arms crossed and legs folded.\nThe dog, Ha Yesong.\nAnd me.\nAfter explaining why I had gathered the executives, I made the declaration.\n“Starting today, we’ll prepare for the Disciplinary Committee exchange meeting. We have 9 days left. The time is tight, so let’s all do our best.”\n“Okay.”\n“Yes…”\n“Of course.”\n“Got it!”\nAnd so, 9 days later, the Disciplinary Committee of Mayeon High School visited Ahsung High School.",

      "content": "Chapter 13 – Rule 8. The Leader Maintains Dignity Even at Exchange Meetings (2)\nMayeon High School.\nOne of the major schools in Academy City with self-governing authority.\nMore than any other school, it shares the highest ratio of bordering district with Ahsung High School.\nAs a result, disputes often arose over the punishment of criminals who crossed between the two school districts.\nOver time, the conflicts deepened, and the two schools frequently glared and growled at each other.\nThus, it was famously known as the school with the worst relationship with Ahsung High School.\nSince I became the Disciplinary Committee Leader, there have been no conflicts with Mayeon High.\nOf course, I was always prepared for one to occur in the future.\nToday might be that day.\n‘I hope the exchange meeting ends without incident….’\nAlthough not religious, I had prayed to God this morning.\nBe it God, Buddha, or ,Golden Sheep I hoped they would hear my prayer.\nThere were scheduled to be two Disciplinary Committee exchange meetings this year.\nThe first semester at Ahsung High School and the second semester at Mayeon High School.\nSo this time, the exchange meeting was held at Ahsung High School.\nOur Ahsung High greeted the Mayeon High students, dressed in their maroon uniforms.\n“Welcome, students of Mayeon High School.”\n“Thank you for the warm welcome, Ahsung High School.”\nThe student council presidents of both schools led the way, exchanging cordial greetings.\n‘So she is the student council president.’\nThe girl smiling brightly like a fully bloomed flower was the student council president of Mayeon High.\nHer smile seemed to create a field of flowers, like something out of a romance comic.\nBecause of that, the atmosphere of the Disciplinary Committee standing behind her looked dramatically contrasting.\nGloomy, one might say.\nOur Disciplinary Committee was no different.\nBecause we were wary of each other.\nThe Disciplinary Committees also greeted each other.\n“Welcome, Mayeon High’s Disciplinary Committee Leader. I am the Disciplinary Committee Leader, Ahn Woo-jin, and this is Vice-Leader Oh Baek-seo.”\n“Ha ha. Nice to meet you, Leader Ahn Woo-jin. I am Leader Lee Jae-ho, and this is Vice-Leader Shin Ga-yeon.”\nWe shook hands out of courtesy.\n“Ha ha.”\n“Ho ho.”\nOh boy, what a firm grip.\nLet’s not start a power struggle here….\nLee Jae-ho, the bespectacled male Disciplinary Committee Leader, was openly displaying his wariness towards me.\nI immediately recognized him as a tiger cub hiding its claws.\nReady to scratch my face at any moment.\nI had no choice but to reveal my own wariness.\n“Oh my, it’s nice to see you both smiling. I’m relieved….”\n“It’s fortunate to see that we’re already getting along.”\nThe student council presidents of Mayeon High and Ahsung High babbled nonsense as they watched us.\nI already felt troubled at the thought of seeing this guy twice.\n“Everyone, please come this way! We’ve prepared plenty of delicious food!”\nHa Ye-song cheerfully led the Mayeon High students.\nAt least Ye-song was bright.\nWe went to the banquet hall and enjoyed the food and drinks set up buffet style. It was arranged with the support of the student council.\nThe somewhat unpleasant atmosphere was significantly mitigated by the cheerful music filling the banquet hall.\nThe student council presidents and key members of the student council were to dine in a separate space.\nMeanwhile, I had no choice but to dine with the Mayeon High Disciplinary Committee Leader and Vice-Leader, along with Oh Baek-seo. It couldn’t be helped; it would look odd if we weren’t together.\nIn the midst of the awkward atmosphere, while we were only moving our utensils, Mayeon High’s Disciplinary Committee Leader Lee Jae-ho raised his glass and spoke.\n“I’m not pleased.”\nJae-ho muttered, almost to himself.\nHis gaze was fixed on the banner on the stage.\nThe banner read “Ahsung High School & Mayeon High School Exchange Meeting” in large letters.\n“Having Ahsung High before Mayeon High is unacceptable.”\nJae-ho clicked his tongue.\n‘Did he just say that out loud?’\nI was utterly dumbfounded.\n“This is Ahsung High. Next time, you can put Mayeon High first.”\n“So you heard me. I was planning to do so anyway.”\nJae-ho’s petty mumbling broke the silence after several minutes, opening up conversation. I appreciated that.\n“By the way, I’ve heard quite a lot about you, Leader Ahn Woo-jin.”\n“Is that so?”\n“Yes. From resolving the Anomia train abduction incident single-handedly on your first day of activity to recently overwhelming the Sword Master of Sindorim in a duel…. You’ve already made quite a name for yourself. You’ll soon be a famous figure, won’t you?”\n“It just happened that way. The duel with the Sword Master was particularly troublesome, though.”\nJae-ho adjusted his glasses once.\n“Still, it’s fortunate. Leader Ahn Woo-jin, you haven’t troubled us with jurisdiction issues ‘yet’. It seems you have some sense.”\n“……”\nA subtle attempt at dominance.\nIt was incredibly uncomfortable.\n“Leader Lee Jae-ho.”\n“Yes.”\n“We do not intend to cause conflicts with Mayeon High’s Disciplinary Committee.”\n“We feel the same. However, please understand one thing. We have no intention of forming a friendly relationship with Ahsung High.”\nIs this guy for real…?",

      "content": "Chapter 13 (Continued)\nEven Mayeon High’s Vice-Leader, Shin Ga-yeon, flinched at her leader’s comment and subtly poked his thigh. She too seemed troubled.\nHowever, Jae-ho wiped the bit of sauce from his mouth with a tissue, maintaining his determined attitude.\n“We are only attending this exchange meeting under the directive of our student council president. I hope there are no misunderstandings.”\nThis is just great….\n“…Leader Lee Jae-ho.”\nSeeing the Vice-Leader of Mayeon High giving signals to maintain decorum, I considered keeping polite. But it was no use.\nThis bespectacled guy was crossing the line, and if I stayed silent, my reputation as the Disciplinary Committee Leader would be tarnished.\nI leaned back in my chair and spoke.\n“Why don’t we drop the formalities? It seems uncomfortable for you to keep using polite speech.”\n“Are you sure about that?”\n“Go ahead. We’re the same age anyway, aren’t we?”\n“I’m a year older than you, kid.”\nThe moment he switched to informal speech, the tension eased slightly.\nAlthough the atmosphere worsened and my morning prayer seemed in vain, this was preferable.\n“Leader, mind your manners…”\nShin Ga-yeon, the Vice-Leader, whispered reproachfully to her leader.\n“It still baffles me.”\nYet, Jae-ho didn’t stop. He folded his arms and continued.\n“Why Ahsung High’s Disciplinary Committee chose a fourth-rank human over Oh Baek-seo for the leader position… Tsk.”\nJae-ho clicked his tongue.\n‘Is this a provocation?’\nWhether he thought so or not, Jae-ho knew that statement was a sore spot for me.\nIt was clear he was provoking me, hoping I would lose my temper.\nIf I showed anger here, the situation would surely escalate. Yes, Jae-ho was testing me arrogantly.\nSo, just as I was about to steer the conversation away,\n“Stop with the pointless talk….”\n“Care to repeat that?”\n“……?”\nWhile I was trying to avoid the provocation and change the topic, a sharp voice came from beside me.\nA soft yet cold tone.\nIt was Oh Baek-seo, seated next to me, who spoke.\nBaek-seo was smiling only with her mouth, her eyes fiercely glaring at the Mayeon High leader.\nJae-ho and Ga-yeon showed signs of surprise.\nEspecially Jae-ho, who seemed not to expect Baek-seo to get angry instead of me.\n“Woo-jin became the leader because he deserved it.”\nWhile we remained silent, Baek-seo spoke clearly in a smooth yet firm voice.\n“Why we should bother getting close to people who can’t even recognize that, is beyond us too.”\nBaek-seo smiled sweetly.\nDespite her polite phrasing, it was evident she was furious.\n“…I see. I apologize for the earlier rudeness.”\nJae-ho closed his eyes and adjusted his glasses.\nIt became evident that his intent was to provoke me as the leader. He desired a power struggle between the leaders.\nIf he had a grudge against Ahsung High’s Disciplinary Committee as a whole, he would have shown anger when Baek-seo made his sharp remark.\n“Tsk.”\nClicking my tongue lightly, I seized the opportunity Baek-seo had created.\n“The recreation activities will begin shortly.”\nI looked towards the stage.\n“We’ve prepared activities filled with ‘competitive elements’ to foster our ‘friendship,’ so I hope you enjoy it to the fullest.”\nI emphasized “friendship” and “competitive elements” on purpose.\nRecreation.\nIt’s typically just an event to foster some enjoyment in an awkward group setting.\nGiven the bad relationship between Ahsung High and Mayeon High, planning such an event seemed rather clueless.\nHowever,\nWhat if the so-called “recreation” was actually a “competition” to determine who is superior?\nThe significance changes entirely.\n“Splendid. You’ve prepared a lot. We’ll gladly enjoy it, Ahsung High.”\nJae-ho smirked.\nThankfully, he understood my hidden message immediately.\nIn fact, I had anticipated Jae-ho’s aggressive attitude from the start.\nWhile preparing for the exchange meeting, I had gathered information on Mayeon High’s current Disciplinary Committee Leader, Lee Jae-ho.\nLee Jae-ho had a tendency to assert dominance over Ahsung High’s Disciplinary Committee.\nMuch like the saying “A nation that forgets its history has no future,” he believed that standing superior to Ahsung High, known for frequent disputes, was the way to benefit Mayeon High.\nI respected his intentions.\nHis logic was to gain an upper hand for his school through the principle of power.\nThus, we had prepared a “competition” under the guise of “recreation.”\nTo respect his intent and determine which Disciplinary Committee was superior.\n‘This is a crucial matter that concerns my dignity as the leader and the honor of our committee.’\nWhat’s the point of being nice to those who want to trample over us?\nWe’d only end up being taken for fools.\nTherefore, we had to win this contest.\nDoing so would not only boost my prestige as the leader but also put the Mayeon High bunch in their place.\nShortly after, the lights in the banquet hall dimmed, leaving only the stage illuminated.\nThe music in the banquet hall quieted, and soon an Ahsung High Disciplinary Committee member took the stage with a microphone.\n“Welcome everyone to the Disciplinary Committee Exchange Meeting!”\nAll eyes in the Disciplinary Committees were focused on the stage.\nA large camera was directed at the stage.\nThe camera feed was being transmitted to the banquet hall where other Disciplinary Committee members were gathered.\nNaturally, not all committee members were in this banquet hall. Otherwise, the hall would be packed.\nThus, some members were split into other halls to enjoy the exchange meeting.\n“We have prepared some recreation activities for a joyous day like today.”\nThe host received formal cheers from both Disciplinary Committees as they introduced the activities and the prizes.\n* * *\n“Wow…. They’ve even prepared recreation activities! I wonder if this will help Mayeon High and Ahsung High’s Disciplinary Committees get along better?”\n“Of course it will. Just look at the leaders laughing and talking. They seem to get along well already. They might become close friends soon….”\n“Oh my. That’s wonderful! My brother is such a kind person; he only befriends kind people, right? If Jae-ho likes him, he must be really kind…! This is great….”\nThe Mayeon High student council president chatted excitedly with the Ahsung High student council president while observing the banquet hall atmosphere through the window.\nHer eyes sparkled brightly.\n‘She’s more innocent than she looks.’\nThe Ahsung High student council president thought while sipping his drink.\nInitially, he had been wary of Mayeon High’s proposal for an exchange meeting. The reason he eventually accepted the proposal was purely for the sake of achievements.\nHe had thought just meeting the formalities would be enough.\nHowever, after several attempts to gauge the Mayeon High student council president, he realized her intentions were pure and decided to set aside his suspicions.\n‘Might as well get along.’\nIf the two Disciplinary Committees became friendly, it would reduce troublesome issues during his term as the student council president.\nGetting people to become friends is always a good thing.\nThe Ahsung High student council president thought so.\nWhile he was letting his guard down,\nJust as the recreation was reaching its final stage, the anticipated trouble finally occurred.",

      "content": "Chapter 14 – Rule 8. The Leader Maintains Dignity Even at Exchange Meetings (3)\n“The recreation will be conducted on a points system! Each game victory earns 1 point! The school with the highest points at the end will be the winner! So, Ahsung High V.S. Mayeon High, who will come out on top? Let’s all enjoy it together!”\nAs the host shouted, special effects spread across the stage.\nThe Disciplinary Committee members clapped in unison.\nAhsung High V.S. Mayeon High.\nIt was a very blatant expression.\nMost students, except for a few innocent ones, quickly realized the hidden meaning behind the recreation planned by Ahsung High.\n“So, they want to challenge us.”\n“Arrogant Ahsung High folks.”\nThis wasn’t just a simple recreation; it was a pride battle between the Disciplinary Committees of each school.\nBoth sides were eager for this.\n“They’re making it interesting.”\n“Glad you see it that way.”\nLee Jae-ho of Mayeon High adjusted his glasses.\nAhn Woo-jin of Ahsung High shrugged his shoulders.\n“You didn’t rig the games, did you?”\n“Do you think we’d stoop to such low tricks? This is a matter of pride. If you’re uncomfortable, you can change the game events.”\n“Fine. Let’s see who comes out on top.”\nPerhaps because they were showing their true intentions, the initial awkwardness had already dissipated.\nThus began the battle between Ahsung High and Mayeon High.\n“Let’s start with something simple… a quiz!”\nFrom the first to the fourth games, the Disciplinary Committee members competed in various events.\nA quiz everyone could participate in, target hitting, magic power battles, and more.\nThe atmosphere heated up.\nAhsung High: 1\nMayeon High: 3\nMayeon High led in points, and the serious competition began from the fifth event.\n“From the fifth game onward, it’s a representative match! Each side will choose their most capable representative to compete!”\nThe host shouted with a smile.\n“First, we need one person from each side who claims to have the best memory. Please step forward!”\nAt the host’s call, Jae-ho showed interest.\n“A memory competition? Good. Go, Seogi!”\nJae-ho sent out his secretary.\n“Park Minhyuk, I choose you!”\n“Whaaat!?”\nPark Minhyuk, the secretary of Ahsung High’s Disciplinary Committee, shuddered at Woo-jin’s declaration.\n“M-me…?”\n“You have the best memory, don’t you?”\n“But, even so, in front of all these people…? Leader, this is…!”\n“Get up there. The honor of our Disciplinary Committee rests on your shoulders.”\n“Ugh….”\nMuttering, “If it’s the leader’s order, I have no choice…,” Minhyuk reluctantly headed to the stage.\nThe secretaries of Mayeon High and Ahsung High stood on stage.\n‘Oh no….’\nMinhyuk felt immense pressure and his legs trembled.\n“Both committees have chosen their secretaries! What an exciting lineup! Let’s move on to the fifth game! This game is… the ‘Card Flip’ game!”\nCommittee members brought out a table. The screen behind the stage showed the table.\nOver 100 cards were scattered on it, all facedown.\n“Each side will take turns flipping cards to find matching pairs. The side with the most pairs wins! There are two full decks on the table! This will require incredible memory and concentration. Are both participants ready?”\n“Yes.”\n“Y-yes….”\n“Then, let’s determine the order…. Okay, Mayeon High’s secretary will go first! Ready, set, go!”\nAfter several rounds of flipping cards and assessing the pairs, Minhyuk, who initially trembled with fear, began to focus on the game.\n“This card with this card… and…”\nWith cautious but confident movements, Minhyuk flipped cards unhesitatingly, earning admiration from Ahsung High members.\nIn contrast, the expressions of Mayeon High members hardened.\nFlipping all the cards with ease, the match ended quickly.\n“Unbelievable! Ahsung High’s secretary Park Minhyuk wins by a landslide! Ahsung High scores! They’re closing the gap rapidly!”\n“Ugh.”\nJae-ho frowned and clenched his fist.\nMeanwhile, Woo-jin hid his rising smile behind a propped fist.\n“Vice-Leader, it’s time to secure our victory.”\n“Huh?”\nJae-ho had no intention of letting Ahsung High gain the upper hand.\n“The games might be rigged in favor of Ahsung High. We need to intervene here.”\nAfter whispering to the Vice-Leader, Jae-ho looked at Woo-jin.\n“Hey, Leader Ahn Woo-jin. You said we could choose the game events, right?”\nJae-ho asked, looking at Woo-jin.\n“Yeah.”\n“Then….”\nJae-ho whispered instructions to Shin Ga-yeon.\n“…Understood.”\nGa-yeon went up on stage and whispered to the host. The committee members looked puzzled.\nThe host glanced at Woo-jin, who nodded. Then, the host handed the microphone and the cue cards to Ga-yeon.\n“From now on, I will take over as the host, and the remaining games will be decided by Mayeon High.”\nThe Mayeon High members cheered in unison.\nAlthough this was a ‘recreation’ under the guise of a ‘Disciplinary Committee battle,’ Ahsung High ultimately organized the events.\nThe suspicion that the games might be increasingly favorable to Ahsung High as they progressed was shared among Mayeon High members.\nThe announcement that their Vice-Leader would decide the game events was naturally welcomed.\nIn such a place where the original purpose of fun had faded and only the intention to determine superiority remained, the change of host mattered little.\nThe original host, feeling regretful that he could not continue, stepped down from the stage.\nNow, only Mayeon High’s Vice-Leader, Shin Ga-yeon, remained on stage.\n“There are two games left. Mayeon High will decide both. The next game is… a mental arithmetic competition. Please send out your best representatives for mental arithmetic.”\nA mental arithmetic competition.\nIt was easy to create problems on the spot and highly fair.\nThe firm resolve of Mayeon High to allow no unfair advantage for Ahsung High was clear to the Disciplinary Committee members.\n“A mental arithmetic competition, huh? Good. I trust you, Treasurer!”\nJae-ho sent out his treasurer.\n“Park Minhyuk, come back. Go, Yoo Doha!”\n“Hmph.”\nWoo-jin also sent out his treasurer.\nYoo Doha, the treasurer of Ahsung High’s Disciplinary Committee, snorted and went up to the stage.\nThus, the treasurers of each school stood side by side on the stage.\n“Go, Jin-du! Go, Jin-du!”\n“Our genius of Mayeon High!”\n“Master of mental arithmetic!”\nMayeon High’s Disciplinary Committee cheered loudly.\nMayeon High’s treasurer, Goo Jin-du.\nHe was a math genius who had swept math competitions since childhood and was a master of mental arithmetic with exceptional cognitive skills.\nThat’s why Mayeon High chose mental arithmetic as the game event, trusting in Jin-du.\n“I will present the problems and manage the proceedings.”\nGa-yeon approached the Ahsung High Disciplinary Committee member sitting by the computer and began creating calculation problems with him.\nMeanwhile, Jin-du looked at Doha.\n‘Yoo Doha…. I knew you’d be here, but to meet like this…’\nJin-du knew Yoo Doha.\n‘Ever since we were young, I always wanted to beat you.’\nOnce, when Yoo Doha participated in a math competition, she took first place, surpassing Jin-du.\nIt was the sudden rise of a supernova.\nFor Jin-du, who thought he was unmatched among his peers in mathematics, it was a shocking experience.\nHe poured all his energy into studying, determined to beat Doha.\nBut Doha never entered another competition.\nThus, Jin-du had been chasing Doha’s shadow, harboring a desire to surpass her.\nThen last year,\nHe heard that Doha had become the treasurer of the Disciplinary Committee.\nWhy would such a genius become a club treasurer?\nDid she give up on the path of mathematics?\nWith those questions, Jin-du decided to become the treasurer of Mayeon High’s Disciplinary Committee.\nHe wanted to understand why the genius Yoo Doha chose that path.\n“Are you the treasurer of Ahsung High’s Disciplinary Committee?”\nGoo Jin-du spoke to Doha.\nTo Doha, Jin-du would be a stranger.\nThat’s why he spoke to her that way.\n“What of it?”\n“Pitiful…”\n“What did you say?”\nIn their private conversation, Doha’s eyes narrowed.\n“As a committee member, you’re stuck serving someone far inferior to Vice-Leader Oh Baek-seo. An idiot who fell for a trivial provocateur’s taunt. I wouldn’t be able to stay under someone like that. The leader should be someone worthy of respect.”\nJin-du smiled insincerely.\n“In that regard, our Leader Lee Jae-ho is a superior person. He’s a genius in the fifth rank and excels in combat. A leader worthy of my respect, unlike a certain deficient Disciplinary Committee.”\nJin-du was a follower of Lee Jae-ho.\nHe supported Jae-ho’s belief in gaining an upper hand over Ahsung High through strength.\nMoreover, Jin-du had been looking forward to competing with Yoo Doha again.\nSo, he belittled Ahsung High’s leader and provoked Doha as much as he could.\nIn other words, it was an attempt at psychological dominance.\nHowever,\n“Ha! How childish.”\n“What?”\nIt didn’t work on Doha.\nShe grinned, showing her white teeth.\n“I remember you, Goo Jin-du…. Weren’t you once called a math genius?”\n“…So what?”\nJin-du felt a brief gratitude that Doha remembered him, but it was short-lived.\n“It was laughable. At best, you were treated as a talented fool.”\n“What?”\n“A wise person bows as they grow taller. You, on the other hand, have become an arrogant fool.”\nDoha’s arrogant laughter left Jin-du stunned.\nHis face darkened as he glared at her.\n“…Are you confident? Confident you can beat me.”\n“Hmph.”\nDoha answered with a snort, as if it was obvious.\nSoon, Ga-yeon spoke into the microphone.\n“All the problems are ready. When the problem appears on the screen, press the buzzer and give your answer. The first person to solve the problem gets the point.”\nGa-yeon activated the recording function on her smartphone to verify the answers.\n“Here comes the first problem.”\nThe white screen on the stage filled with numbers.\n“What is the answer to the following multiplication?”\nBuzz!\n“162,726,355,641,251,339,887,408.”\n“…!?”\nAs soon as the problem appeared on the screen, the buzzer was pressed, and the answer was immediately recited.\nAt such an unbelievable speed, all the committee members, including Goo Jin-du, were astonished.\nThe one who got the correct answer was Yoo Doha, the treasurer of Ahsung High’s Disciplinary Committee.\n‘I haven’t even finished reading the problem…?’\nJin-du could perform mental arithmetic on long strings of numbers within four seconds.\nHowever, Yoo Doha’s mental arithmetic speed was on another level.\n“What is the answer to the next problem!?”\nBuzz!\n“63,535,204,842,302,171,750,112,507,137,882.”\n“Next problem!”\nBuzz!\n“729,217,309,281,496,226,404,840,339,658,521,620,358.”\n“The answer to the next multiplication problem…?”\nBuzz!\nBuzz!\nBuzz!\nWith each problem that appeared, Doha immediately pressed the buzzer and nonchalantly recited the answers.\nDue to the high numerical values, she quickly read the numbers like, “One six two seven two six three five five…”\nAfter verifying with a computer calculator, all the numbers Doha recited were correct.\nJust to be sure, the host, Ga-yeon, even played back the recordings on the device to confirm. Each time, the amazement only grew.\nThus, ten problems ended in an instant.\nMayeon High’s Goo Jin-du: 0 points\nAhsung High’s Yoo Doha: 10 points\nIt was a decisive victory for Yoo Doha.\n“…Ahsung High’s Disciplinary Committee treasurer, Yoo Doha, wins. This ties the score between Mayeon High and Ahsung High.”\nThe members of Mayeon High’s Disciplinary Committee, who had been confident of victory, were all in shock.\nJae-ho and even Vice-Leader Ga-yeon were no exception.\n“Wow!!”\n“Amazing!\n“Senior Doha, you’re incredible!”",

      "content": "Chapter 14 (Continued)\nThe Ahsung High Disciplinary Committee erupted in cheers.\nDoha, having secured the victory, snorted arrogantly.\n“How could anyone do such quick mental arithmetic…?”\n“This is basic mental arithmetic.”\nJin-du was in disbelief.\nHe had always thought no one in Academy City could match his mental arithmetic skills.\nEven if it was Yoo Doha, the only person who had ever beaten him, it seemed impossible.\nAn unexpected sense of helplessness began to overwhelm Jin-du, making his body tremble.\nIn a final effort, Jin-du decided to ask,\n“…Do you remember? When you participated in the math competition.”\n“What, you knew me? So what?”\n“Why did you stop after just one participation?”\n“That? Well, just because….”\nDoha winked her right eye and dug into her right ear with her pinky finger.\n“It was boring.”\n“……!”\nThat one sentence stirred intense feelings of doubt within Jin-du.\nThe stage he had taken so seriously was just a brief amusement for Doha.\nJin-du couldn’t say another word.\nHe just lowered his head, shaking with self-doubt.\nDoha observed Jin-du for a moment before speaking.\n“Hey.”\n“?”\nHer voice was serious.\n“Leader Ahn Woo-jin didn’t become our school’s Disciplinary Committee Leader for nothing.”\nSuddenly, a memory surfaced in Doha’s mind.\nLast year, when Yoo Doha was a first-year student.\nDuring a survival test in a forest on the outskirts of Academy City, a dangerous incident\noccurred involving a group of monsters due to a security breach in the test site.\nStudents, driven into a panic by the monster attack, were unable to evacuate.\nAt that time, Ahn Woo-jin hid the students in a nearby temporary shelter, locked the door, and fought the monsters to buy time.\n─ “You shall not pass here.”\nDespite having his flesh torn by strong jaws and coughing up blood from heavy blows, Woo-jin fought the monsters, roaring at them.\nSenior members of the Disciplinary Committee and one of the few teachers in Academy City arrived just in time to help Woo-jin defeat the monster horde.\nAfterward, despite bleeding heavily, Woo-jin casually checked on the students’ safety first.\nDoha couldn’t understand Woo-jin no matter how much she thought about it.\nHow could he risk his life and fight such a lonely battle to protect the students?\nSo she asked.\nWhy did he fight so desperately?\nDoha regretted asking right away.\nEven she thought it was a ridiculous question. It was especially inappropriate to ask such a question to her savior.\nBut Woo-jin responded nonchalantly, as if it were the most obvious thing.\n─ “I’m the Disciplinary Committee Leader.”\nDoha could never forget Woo-jin from that day.\nShe would never forget him for the rest of her life.\n“He became the leader because he deserves it. If you don’t understand, at least keep your mouth shut.”\n“…….”\n“A fool who can’t even do proper mental arithmetic.”\nWith a blunt insult, Doha stepped off the stage.\n* * *\n‘As expected of our treasurer!’\nThank you!\nI wasn’t sure about her personality or intelligence, but I trusted her mental arithmetic abilities.\nWith this, Ahsung High and Mayeon High were tied.\n“Tsk….”\nJae-ho clicked his tongue.\nIt seemed he was quite upset after witnessing the overwhelming defeat of Mayeon High’s pride.\n“The next game is the last one. What will it be?”\n“…You’ll see.”\nJae-ho’s tone was cryptic, suggesting he had something special in mind for the final game.\nJae-ho responded, his eyes filled with resentment as he stared at the stage.\n“Now, for the final game. The strongest person with enhanced physical strength through magic. In other words, the person with the most power. Please step forward.”\n“I’ll go.”\nUnable to bear it any longer, Jae-ho decided to step up himself.\nThere was no more room to retreat.\nJae-ho looked at me.\n“How about you join, Leader Ahn Woo-jin?”\n“What?”\n“We should have a proper match between us.”\nI see.\nHe wanted the final game to be a showdown between the leaders.\n‘…Why me?’\nI didn’t want to.\nIf I lost, it would be humiliating.\nThe reason I could plan a competition under the guise of recreation was that my subordinates were incredibly capable.\nMemory genius Park Minhyuk, mental arithmetic prodigy Yoo Doha, all-rounder Oh Baek-seo….\nWith them around, I was confident we wouldn’t lose.\nBut imagine a duel between the leaders.\nWhat if I lost after my team had performed so well?\nIt would dramatically tarnish my honor as the Disciplinary Committee Leader and severely damage my reputation…!\nThose who already doubted my capabilities would grow even more skeptical.\nMoreover, the score between Ahsung High and Mayeon High was tied.\nThis was the highlight, the final game.\nConsidering that this match would conclude the pride battle between the two committees, the pressure was immense.\nTherefore,\n‘It would be best to avoid this challenge….’\n“Leader…!”\n“Leader, you’re not backing out, are you? We’ve done our part, now it’s your turn.”\nSecretary Minhyuk and Treasurer Doha urged me.\n“Leader?”\nPerhaps due to my hesitation, even Baek-seo looked at me with questioning eyes.\n‘Ah….’\nOnly then did I realize.\n‘Now that I think about it, it was secretary versus secretary and treasurer versus treasurer, wasn’t it?’\nThe lineup was such that now, the other leader wanted to step up, and if I didn’t respond…\n‘I can’t avoid this…!’\nA leader of Ahsung High’s Disciplinary Committee couldn’t afford to act cowardly.\n“Hmm…, I suppose I should.”\nIn the end, I had to pretend to be nonchalant as I stood up.\nA cold sweat dripped down my cheek.\n‘This is bad….’\nIf I had known it would come to this, I wouldn’t have prepared this recreation….\n“Leader, fight on…!”\n“If you lose, I won’t let you off, Leader.”\nWith the cheers from the secretary and the treasurer, I headed to the stage with Vice-Leader Oh Baek-seo.\n‘The opponent is a genius who has reached the fifth rank, one of Mayeon High’s top fighters….’\nHe would have the upper hand in most games.\nIt was truly worrisome.\nMy steps felt heavy.\nI felt like my legs might give out at any moment.\nAs I walked, the cheers from the committee members filled my ears.\n“Leader, Vice-Leader!”\n“You look great…!”\n“Please defeat Mayeon High!”\nMaintaining a cold exterior, I listened to their cheers.\nI was acutely aware that every member of the Disciplinary Committee, except for those on duty, was present.\nI wanted to close my eyes tightly.\nBut I barely resisted the urge, inwardly praying with all my heart.\n‘I can’t lose, I can’t lose, I can’t lose…! I must win…! Please, let me win…!’\nI pleaded.\nIf there’s any divine entity, please hear my prayer. Please….\n‘I can’t lose. Think of this as a cliff. If I fall, it’s over. Finished…!’\n“Leader.”\nIn the midst of hypnotizing myself, Baek-seo’s voice caught my attention.\n“What?”\nI tried to maintain a calm demeanor as I looked at Baek-seo.\n“You know I serve you, right?”\n“?”\nWhy bring that up now?\n“You can win. Let’s defeat their leader. If you win, I’ll give you a reward.”\nBaek-seo smiled kindly.\nWhat could I say….\nThe Vice-Leader always seemed to say what I needed to hear at the right moment.\nAlmost as if he could read my mind.\n‘Surely that can’t be the case.’\nDid I let something slip?\nNo… I was keeping a poker face, so that couldn’t be it.\nIt must just be encouragement from her as the Vice-Leader.\nA reward, huh.\n“By the way, can I ask what the reward is in advance?”\n“Well…, maybe the stockings I’m wearing now.”\n“!”\nMy eyes instinctively moved towards Baek-seo’s legs, covered in black stockings.\nI quickly regained control of my eyes and brought them back to their original position.\n“Don’t joke like that. Especially as a Disciplinary Committee member.”\nI gave her a stern look.\n“Haha, sorry.”\nBaek-seo laughed softly, covering her mouth with a lightly clenched fist.\nI realized once again, I could never let my guard down around her.\n‘…But I feel a bit better.’\nMaybe it was the nature of the joke.\nPerhaps it acted as a shock therapy, relieving some of my tension.\nBaek-seo and I got on the stage.\nJae-ho stood on the opposite side.\n“The leaders of each Disciplinary Committee have stepped forward.”\nThe announcement came, signaling the beginning of the final showdown between Ahsung High and Mayeon High.\nThe host, Ga-yeon, stood next to Jae-ho as she spoke.\nMeanwhile, I glared at her, steeling my resolve.\n‘Say whatever you want. If it seems even slightly unfair, I’ll protest immediately…!’\nIn fact, even if the game was fair, if it seemed disadvantageous to me, I planned to find a reason to protest. My brain was already working at full capacity for this.\n“Vice-Leader, quickly announce the next game.”\nJae-ho adjusted his glasses, never taking his eyes off me.\n“Yes, the next game is….”\nThe Disciplinary Committee members brought a sturdy table and two chairs, placing them between Jae-ho and me.\n“Arm wrestling. However, magic reinforcement is allowed.”\nArm wrestling?\nThe committee members started murmuring among themselves.\nA smile spread across Jae-ho’s face.\n“This should be interesting.”\nHe seemed pleased with the choice of the game.\nNow that I thought about it, didn’t he call for the strongest person earlier? And the game turned out to be arm wrestling….\n‘This seems… too fair.’\nThere appeared to be no room for objections.\nArm wrestling.\nA very straightforward competition to determine who was stronger.\nAnd in arm wrestling, I felt I had a fair chance.\n“In this event, the use of magic is permitted. Only up to body reinforcement. So, this arm wrestling match will not only test physical strength but also magic ability.”\nIn other words, it was a test of which side’s abilities were superior.\n“Leaders, please step up to the table.”\n* * *\n“Hmph.”\nJae-ho adjusted his glasses and smiled, but internally, he was sweating bullets.\n‘If I lose, it’s all over…! I absolutely can’t lose!’\nWith both Disciplinary Committees from Ahsung High and Mayeon High watching.\nThe secretary and treasurer had already lost, damaging Mayeon High’s pride.\nThe score was tied, and this was the final match.\nFeeling the pressure, Jae-ho had decided to step up himself.\n‘I spoke out of anger and called out Ahn Woo-jin…! I should have held back!’\nJae-ho clenched his fist, regretting his impulsive decision.\nHe felt he had no choice but to challenge Woo-jin to a leader versus leader match.\nHowever, he quickly adjusted his thoughts.\n‘No, those determined eyes and expression… He would have stepped up even if I hadn’t called him…!’\nA leader versus leader match would have happened regardless.\nThe immense pressure bore down on Jae-ho.\nIf he lost here….\nMayeon High’s Disciplinary Committee’s pride would be shattered, and they would be seen as inferior to Ahsung High.\nMoreover, after watching the sparring video between Woo-jin and the Sindo-rim Swordmaster, Jae-ho held a high opinion of Woo-jin.\nThe earlier disparaging remarks were merely to provoke him as part of their psychological warfare.\nThat’s why he had backed off when Baek-seo intervened.\n‘Damn, why does this guy have such an imposing aura!? He looks unnecessarily strong…!’\nFrom the moment he first met Woo-jin, Jae-ho had seen no sign of weakness.\nWoo-jin was calm and stern.\nBecause of this, an inexplicable sense of intimidation radiated from Woo-jin.\nJae-ho swallowed dryly.\nSuddenly, his mind was flooded with various anxious thoughts.\n‘Did you hear? Our school’s leader lost to Ahsung High’s leader!’\n‘They arm-wrestled with magic reinforcement, I heard.’\n‘The secretary and treasurer got defeated too, at their own games.’\n‘So what? Our Disciplinary Committee is inferior to Ahsung High’s?’\n‘Is our Disciplinary Committee that weak?’\n‘Pathetic.’\nHe imagined the students gossiping, the reputation of Mayeon High’s Disciplinary Committee plummeting, and screamed internally.\n‘Calm down, Lee Jae-ho…! Your honor as Mayeon High’s leader is on the line here. You must win, even if it means risking everything…!’\nJae-ho felt extreme tension.\nA slight lapse in concentration, and his legs might give out.\n“Bring it on, Leader Ahn Woo-jin. Let’s see who’s superior here!”\n“That’s exactly what I want.”\nJae-ho smirked confidently, while Woo-jin maintained a cold demeanor, lightly lowering his head and holding the brim of his cap.\nThe two men placed their elbows on the table and clasped hands.\nAnd then.\n‘Please let me win…!’\n‘Please don’t let me lose, please…!’\nBoth men earnestly prayed inwardly.",

      "content": "Chapter 15 – Rule 8. The Leader Maintains Dignity Even at Exchange Meetings (4)\nIn Academy City, famous strong individuals are given appropriate ‘nicknames.’\nA prime example is Oh Baek-seo, the military representative and strongest person at Ahsung High School, a peerless genius. Her nickname is ‘Daehan Butterfly.’\nMayeon High School is no exception. Separate from the student council president who represents the school’s military strength, the Disciplinary Committee Leader, Lee Jae-ho, also has a nickname. His is ‘Rock Cloud General’.\nAhn Woo-jin was feeling dizzy at the thought of arm-wrestling against someone with a nickname. However, he couldn’t back down.\n“The match will be decided in a single round.”\nThe host, Shin Ga-yeon, placed both her hands over the clasped hands of Ahn Woo-jin and Lee Jae-ho.\n“If you attempt any technique other than physical enhancement through magical power, such as a ‘Magic Formula,’ you will be immediately disqualified. Please keep this in mind.”\nA magic formula refers to techniques derived from developing one’s unique abilities. This had nothing to do with Woo-jin, who had no unique abilities.\n“The table is made of the hardest known magic stone, reinforced with magical coating, so don’t worry about it breaking unless you intend to destroy it.”\nWoo-jin and Jae-ho flinched.\nTheir plan to discreetly break the table to nullify the match if they thought they were going to lose was shattered.\n“That doesn’t matter! Who cares about the table; it won’t affect our match!”\n“Even if the table broke, the match would continue.”\nSince the table wasn’t going to break, the two, showing off a gladiator’s mindset, bluffed.\n“You both have strong competitive spirits.”\nHost Ga-yeon nodded, adjusting her glasses.\nJae-ho, grinding his teeth, shouted impatiently.\n“Hurry up and start the match, vice leader!”\nThere was no retreat. Only moving forward remained.\n“It’s a ‘match,’ sir, not a ‘duel.’”\n“Whatever…!”\n“Alright then, get ready.”\nWoo-jin and Jae-ho focused on their clasped hands.\nTheir honor as disciplinary committee leaders was at stake.\n“Begin!”\nAs soon as Ga-yeon shouted and removed her hands, the veins on Woo-jin and Jae-ho’s arms bulged.\nThud! They poured their magical power into strengthening their bodies, putting all their strength into their arms.\n“Ugh…!”\n“Argh…!”\nThe two let out grunts as the intense struggle for dominance began.\nRumble…!\nThe ground began to shake.\n“What’s happening, an earthquake?”\n“It feels like the air is trembling….”\nThe students murmured.\nRumble…!\nThe table, dishes, and glassware began to tremble and then shatter in succession, starting from the arm-wrestling match.\nClang!\n“Ah!”\n“Did the glass break!?”\n“The dishes too!?”\nGlassware and dishes around the two disciplinary committee leaders shattered like dominoes.\n“Argh…!”\n“Ugh…!”\nWoo-jin and Jae-ho, eyes wide open, continued their power struggle.\nRumble! The magical power they poured into their bodies clashed violently, creating powerful shockwaves and a fierce wind. Their hair and clothes fluttered incessantly like flags in a storm.\nStage props toppled over, their remnants swept away by the magical shockwaves from the arm-wrestling match.\nAmidst the chaos, Woo-jin and Jae-ho continued to arm-wrestle with all their might.\n“Ahsung High’s Disciplinary Committee Leader isn’t being pushed back at all!”\n“Our leader isn’t losing against the Rock Cloud General!”\n“Amazing….”\nThe students were left speechless.\n‘What is this guy!? He’s not budging at all…!?’\nJae-ho was astounded by Woo-jin’s unyielding arm. The collision of magical power was equally intense. Despite the clash, Woo-jin wasn’t being pushed back at all.\nThe arm strength and density of magical power. This was hardly something one would expect from someone at the fourth Level.\nDid he deceive about his Level? No.\nThose with unique abilities can instinctively identify others with unique abilities, confirming it later when they don’t use their abilities.\nHowever, Woo-jin gave off not even a trace of that feeling. This man certainly hadn’t reached the fifth Level.\n‘How can this be the fourth Level…!?’\nJae-ho recalled Woo-jin’s match against Shindo-rim.\nWoo-jin’s mastery of magical power was at an artistic Level. Particularly, condensing lightning magic into a shockwave was an extraordinary technique. In such refined skill, Jae-ho judged Woo-jin to be superior.\nHowever, in terms of the density or quantity of magical power, Jae-ho believed he was superior. Generally, the higher the Level, the more superior the magical power. The gap of even one Level is enormous.\nBut Woo-jin was different. He seemed to mock that common sense.\nHow could his magical power be so exceptional that he didn’t falter against someone a Level higher? Jae-ho was in utter disbelief.\n‘One thing is certain…!’\nJae-ho’s initial doubt about Woo-jin transformed into certainty.\n‘This guy isn’t just any strong fourth-Level. He’s a monster in the making…!’\nSuddenly, images of heroes from fairy tales came to Jae-ho’s mind.\nThe historical heroes who led the Golden Ram Hunt.\nThe ‘Argonauts,’ who reached the eighth Tier among humans.\nJae-ho liked the history of the Argonauts and memorized their chronicles in detail.\nSo he knew. The Argonauts took a very long time to reach the fifth Level, but they had already distinguished themselves at the fourth Level.\nThe more exceptional the unique ability, the more time and effort it took to awaken that ability. The conditions for achievement were stringent.\nFor someone with overwhelming talent like Oh Baek-seo, the required time and effort were significantly reduced. However, Woo-jin didn’t seem any less talented than Baek-seo.\nIf Woo-jin was this capable at the fourth Level, there was a high possibility he had talent surpassing even Baek-seo.\n‘This guy will reach the fifth Level soon.’\nHaving achieved this much at the fourth Level, Woo-jin’s talent would undoubtedly break through the barrier to the fifth Level.\n‘If this guy is of Argonaut caliber….’\nA hero’s rank.\nWoo-jin might become a titan who could turn Academy City upside down.\nRumble!\n“The ground…!”\n“Everyone, get away!”\nAs the magical power waves spread in all directions, the ground began to crumble. The disciplinary committee members all ran away.\nCrash! As the stage floor shattered and sank, Woo-jin and Jae-ho were startled but quickly composed themselves and continued their arm-wrestling.\nBoom!\nThe aftermath of the arm-wrestling caused a storm, scattering the debris of the stage floor everywhere. Before long, the banquet hall was left with only Woo-jin and Jae-ho, who were fiercely arm-wrestling, and their vice-leader.\n“Grrr!”\nJae-ho’s arm started to move backward.\n‘No, this can’t happen…!’\nJae-ho strained his muscles, veins bulging in his neck.\n“Ugh…!”\nSlowly, their arms returned to the center of the table.\nCrack!\n“Ugh…!”\nMagical power waves continued to crash around them, shaking the air. Baek-seo and Ga-yeon, who were nearby, had to draw their weapons and take defensive stances to withstand the magical impact.\n“Incredible….”\n“Is this truly an arm-wrestling match…!”\nThe disciplinary committee members watched from a distance, swallowing hard as they observed the arm-wrestling match.\nThey couldn’t imagine what fate would befall them if they got close to those two. Even when fourth Levels clashed, or even most fifth Levels, the intensity wouldn’t be this high. This was a showdown that only top-tier fifth Levels could produce.\nYet one of them was the fourth-Level Woo-jin. It was unbelievable.\n“Hey, Ahn Woo-jin! You’re starting to look tired, aren’t you? Why don’t you stop this pointless struggle and give up? Huh!?”\nJae-ho provoked, sweating profusely.\n“Don’t be ridiculous…. Lee Jae-ho, do you even realize how your neck veins are about to burst…!?”\n“That’s just my natural condition…! Even a slight exertion makes my veins pop…! That’s what happens when you have so little body fat!”\n“Don’t you remember almost losing just now?”\n“I was just taking it easy because a funny thought crossed my mind…! In the end, you couldn’t overpower my arm, could you!?”\n“Utter nonsense…!”\nWoo-jin and Jae-ho forced smiles.\n‘Just give in already!’\n‘Let me win!’\nBoth were inwardly desperate, wanting to cry.\n‘This won’t do.’\nWoo-jin thought.\nHe needed a decisive blow.\nIf he lost here, his honor as the disciplinary committee leader would be utterly destroyed. His brain treated this recognition as a matter of life and death, making his thoughts flash rapidly.\n“!”\nFrom the flash of thoughts, Woo-jin recalled a piece of game knowledge.\n─ ‘Even attending the exchange meeting is all due to the student council president’s orders.’\nThe reason Jae-ho was attending this exchange meeting.\nIt was because of the student council president’s orders.\nThe student council president was Jae-ho’s older sister.\nAnd.\n‘That’s right. This guy is a siscon!’\nJae-ho, being a siscon, couldn’t refuse his sister’s orders and attended this event.\nAn idea struck Woo-jin.\nHe voiced his thought without any filter.\n“Lee Jae-ho, you’re here because the student council president told you to, right!?”\nDue to the intense waves from the arm-wrestling, Woo-jin had to raise his voice.\n“So what if I am!?”\n“You’re the student council president’s little brother…! What, you have to follow everything your sister says? Even if it means holding an exchange meeting with us, whom you dislike?”\nWoo-jin laughed derisively.\n“Are you a siscon?”\nAs expected, Jae-ho’s face flushed red.\nJae-ho had often been insulted as a siscon but had never imagined hearing it directly from Woo-jin.\nHe snapped.\n“What…! How dare you…! Ugh!”\nJae-ho couldn’t continue his words.\nIn the moment he lost his cool and got distracted, Woo-jin seized the opportunity and exerted more force into his arm.\nJae-ho’s arm, having lost its pace, began to move backward.\n“Grrr…! You despicable bastard…!”\nJae-ho couldn’t afford to lose either.\n“Then you… Aren’t you ashamed to be a leader, overshadowed by Oh Baek-seo!?”\n“What…?”\n“At least prove you’re more capable than Oh Baek-seo to become the leader…! Don’t you think you’re a disgrace to Ahsung High School!?”\nJae-ho targeted Woo-jin’s weakness.\nHe believed there must be a reason why Woo-jin became the leader, but that was the only attack he could think of at the moment.\n“Oh Baek-seo must feel disappointed…! Having to serve under someone weaker than herself! I have constantly proven my strength to be proud of my position in our disciplinary committee! Unlike you!”\n“So what…!”\nJae-ho continued to shout.\n“Look at our vice-leader! Such an intelligent and skilled individual supporting me! That’s proof of my capabilities!”\n“Ridiculous! Do you think I’ve done nothing!? And our vice-leader is no less intelligent! Even compared to yours!”\n“What!? Hah!”\nFueled by the adrenaline, both felt a fierce competitive spirit.\nEventually, Woo-jin’s remark caused a cross-shaped vein to pop up on Jae-ho’s forehead.\n“Are you saying our vice-leader is less intelligent than yours!?”\n“You know our vice-leader’s reputation very well…!”\nThe student council presidents, noticing the escalating argument, wore troubled expressions.\nThey realized things had gone wrong as the two leaders snarled at each other.\nThe disciplinary committee members watched with bated breath, munching on popcorn, completely engrossed in the showdown.\nIn front of this spectacle, both disciplinary committees felt united as if sitting together in a movie theater.\n“Hah! Our vice-leader is wise and smart! And she looks great in glasses! She is the best, with both beauty and brains! Do you think your vice-leader can match ours!?”\n“Our vice-leader is also a complete package, with both beauty and brains…!”\n“Our vice-leader is the best supporter…!”\n“Our vice-leader is the undisputed strongest in Ahsung High…!”\nThe argument between the two leaders turned into a boasting match about their vice-leaders.\nGradually, the expressions of the two vice-leaders began to change.\nShin Ga-yeon’s face turned bright red, as if radiating heat.\nOh Baek-seo tried to maintain a gentle smile but couldn’t stop the corners of her mouth from twitching. Even she couldn’t control her expression.\nThe leaders’ bickering was causing their vice-leaders significant embarrassment and discomfort.\nFinally, the inevitable happened.\n“Our Ga-yeon is…!”\n“Stop it already!!!”\nBoom!!\n“Ugh!”\nA suddenly enlarged hammer struck Jae-ho, sending him flying. The hammer, infused with magical power, was incredibly powerful.\nJae-ho’s body flew through the air, hitting the ground hard and rolling until he finally crashed into a wall, coming to a stop.\nThough he had strengthened his body with magic, preventing severe injuries, the psychological damage was considerable.\nJae-ho, bewildered, looked blankly at the stage.\n“Huff, huff…!”\nGa-yeon, holding the large hammer, stood with a face red as a ripe apple, catching her breath.\nHer patience, usually calm and composed, had reached its limit.",

      "content": "Chapter 15 (Continued)\n“Do you intend to kill me, leader!?”\nGa-yeon shouted in a high-pitched voice, unable to control her emotions. Tears welled up in her eyes.\nOnly then did Jae-ho regain his senses and realize he had made a mistake.\n“…?”\nWoo-jin was momentarily confused by what had just happened.\nThen, someone gently tugged at Woo-jin’s collar.\n“?”\nWoo-jin turned to see Oh Baek-seo holding his collar.\n“Leader, could you please stop now?”\nBaek-seo’s usual warm smile was there, but the corners of her mouth twitched uncontrollably.\nHer voice was kind, but Woo-jin felt a strange and deadly aura.\n“Oh.”\n“No way….”\n“Unbelievable….”\nThe disciplinary committee members were bewildered by the unexpected turn of events.\nThe musicians were equally stunned, unable to continue their performance.\nFor a while, the banquet hall was filled with silence.\n…\nThe next day.\n[ Recreation Results ]\n─ Ahsung High School: Victory.\n─ Mayeon High School: Defeat.\nLee Jae-ho readily accepted his defeat. He had lost his temper, made mistakes, and caused harm to his vice-leader’s spirit. He had no right to criticize her intervention.\nHowever, since it wasn’t an entirely fair competition, no one thought either side was weaker.\n“That was incredible….”\n“Looks like Ahn Woo-jin isn’t just an ordinary fourth-Level.”\n“He was on par with the Rock Cloud General!?”\n“So he didn’t become the leader through cheap tricks?”\nThe scene the disciplinary committee members witnessed spread through the school like wildfire. Students who still doubted Woo-jin’s position began to reevaluate him.\nAdditionally.\n“I heard Mayeon High lost?”\n“They say Oh Baek-seo didn’t even step in.”\n“Do you think the leader and vice-leader are dating?”\n“They’re always together, so it’s possible.”\n“The way they praised their vice-leaders yesterday… it was so cringy.”\n“They just ended up boasting about their vice-leaders during the match. Saying they’re dating is an exaggeration.”\n“They were probably just showing off their competitive spirit.”\nThus, the students of Ahsung High School continued to gossip about the disciplinary committee.\n* * *\nThe disciplinary committee’s office was filled with silence and the aroma of coffee.\nI placed my coffee cup down and, after reviewing the documents, began signing the signature line bearing my name.\n“……”\nSoon, my pen stopped abruptly.\nI was reminded of yesterday’s events.\nI hung my head.\nThunk!\nI slammed my forehead onto the desk.\n‘I want to die.’\nI couldn’t bear the thought of living with this embarrassment.\nThe student council president had scolded me for fighting at the exchange meeting. Mayeon High likely faced the same situation. That wasn’t important.\nThe match ended with Ahsung High’s victory. That too wasn’t important.\n…Actually, maybe that was important?\nRegardless, I had placed a heavy burden on Baek-seo yesterday.\nI felt sorry.\n‘How can I face Baek-seo now…?’\nI should have maintained my composure.\nNo matter how much I regretted it, I couldn’t rewind the past.\nAt that moment.\nClick.\nHearing the door to the executive office open, I quickly straightened my posture. As the Disciplinary Committee Leader, I couldn’t afford to show any sign of disarray.\nThe person who entered was Oh Baek-seo.\n“Vice-leader? Hello….”\n“Good morning.”\nBaek-seo smiled kindly as she greeted me.\n‘Should I apologize for yesterday…?’\nIt was a topic difficult to bring up again.\nWas an apology necessary?\nWouldn’t Baek-seo also prefer to let it slide?\nWhile I was lost in thought, I noticed a rectangular box Baek-seo was holding.\n“What’s that?”\n“This?”\nBaek-seo placed the gift box on my desk.\n“It’s a gift from Mayeon High. One of their students brought it over.”\n“A gift?”\nThe delivery slip indicated it was sent by Mayeon High School’s Disciplinary Committee Leader and addressed to Ahsung High School’s Disciplinary Committee Leader.\nThe box was fairly large.\n“Why did they send it?”\n“Haven’t you checked your email?”\n“Not yet.”\n“I checked the email sent to you. They said it’s a congratulatory gift for our victory.”\n“Hmm.”\nI went online to check the email from Lee Jae-ho.\n—\n**Sender**: Lee Jae-ho\n**Recipient**: Ahn Woo-jin\n—\nDear Disciplinary Committee Leader of Ahsung High School,\nI am Lee Jae-ho, the Disciplinary Committee Leader of Mayeon High School.\nThank you for graciously hosting our Mayeon High School Disciplinary Committee during the exchange meeting.\nAlso, please accept this gift as a token of our congratulations on your victory in the recreational activities.\nHave a great day.\n—\n‘This is… a way of asking us to keep quiet.’\nIt was clear what the message implied.\nMayeon High’s Disciplinary Committee had taken a significant hit to their reputation from the exchange meeting. They were essentially asking us not to bring it up in the future.\n‘I hadn’t intended to anyway.’\nI had no intention of tarnishing the honor of another disciplinary committee.\n“Did the Student Council President receive a gift too?”\n“Probably.”\nAs I talked with Baek-seo, I opened the gift box.\nRip.\nA luxurious case was revealed. I opened the lid.\n‘Oh?’\nInside was a long rod with a handle. It was about the size of the baton I usually carried.\nIt resembled a lightning rod in design but was sleek and could be retracted like a baton.\nI immediately recognized what it was.\n‘A Lightning Rod?’\nIt was a rare magical tool that stored lightning magic and released it at the wielder’s command.\nI could use lightning magic through a baton with magic circuits, but I could only discharge a minimal amount of lightning externally.\nThis made the magical tool incredibly useful for me.\n‘How impressive… How did they manage to send something like this?’\nThough it seemed too extravagant as a hush gift, I soon figured out the reason.\n‘Ah, the Student Council President’s influence must have been involved.’\nThe Mayeon High Student Council President, who wanted to build a good relationship with Ahsung High’s Disciplinary Committee through this exchange, likely coordinated the gift with Lee Jae-ho.\nIn essence, the magical tool also carried the message, ‘Let’s not fight anymore and become friends.’\n“This is quite a gift… I’ll send a thank-you note.”\n“I’ll do it. It’s a gift to me, after all.”\n“Got it.”\nBaek-seo nodded.\n“And…”\nBaek-seo pulled something from her pocket and placed it on my desk.\n“This is a reward from me.”\n“Huh? Oh, right.”\nI remembered Baek-seo promising a reward if I defeated Lee Jae-ho.\nI quickly realized that the stockings mentioned as a reward yesterday were just a provocative joke.\nSo what was the real reward?\nI looked at it closely.\n‘A card?’\nIt was a beautifully made card, hand-crafted by Baek-seo.\nI read the content of the card.\n—\n**[Oh Baek-seo Voucher]**\n— Once: Rest your head on Oh Baek-seo’s lap and receive an ear cleaning. This card’s effect cannot be nullified.\n※ Usable only by Ahn Woo-jin, Disciplinary Committee Leader\n—\n“……”\nThis was… entirely unexpected.\nCompared to the joke she made yesterday, this wasn’t particularly extreme, but it was still quite an embarrassing reward.\n“Um…, thank you. I’ll use it well.”\n“Sure, use it whenever you need.”\nBaek-seo smiled brightly and headed to the sofa, seemingly unbothered.\nMaybe it was just my imagination, but her ears appeared redder than usual. She quickly brushed her hair to cover them, making it hard to see clearly.\nAnyway, I stared at the card for a while.\nThis didn’t seem like a mere prank.\n‘Wait?’\nA sudden thought struck me like lightning.\n‘Could it be… that the vice-leader likes me?’\nIt was a reasonable assumption.\nYesterday’s bold joke and now this embarrassing voucher for an ear cleaning.\n‘You wouldn’t do this for someone you don’t have feelings for…!’\nThere was a good way to find out her feelings.\nCasually asking her out on a date.\nI was about to call out to Baek-seo.\n“Baek—”\n“About yesterday.”\nHer voice cut me off.\n“I realized I really need to take care of you, leader.”\nShe turned to look at me.\nHer usual smile was on her face.\n“I heard your praises for me. So that’s how you see me?”\n“Well, yes…”\nBaek-seo smiled brightly, like a blooming flower.\n“I also consider you precious, as a colleague in the disciplinary committee.”\n“……”\nI swallowed hard.\nGratitude and ambiguity took up residence in my heart.\n“I see. I’m glad you think that way.”\nI smiled back and nodded.\nBaek-seo turned her head away again.\n‘Phew.’\nA silent sigh escaped through my teeth, against my will.\nHer words, ‘I need to take care of you,’ and ‘as a colleague,’ filled my mind.\n‘So… like a boss looking after a subordinate, or a mother looking after her son…. Maybe it’s that kind of feeling.’\nTo Baek-seo, I seemed to be ‘the leader who needs taking care of.’\nThis wasn’t just about whether she had feelings for me or not; it was about my pride.\nA sense of futility washed over me.\n‘Let’s stop jumping to conclusions….’\nWhether there were feelings or not.\nIn the same organization, it’s better not to touch on these matters unless you’re sure.\nIt could make the relationship between friends and colleagues awkward.\nLet’s stop the idle thoughts.\nFirst, I need to solidify my position as a leader.\nI need to overturn Baek-seo’s perception of me as ‘the leader who needs taking care of.’\n“……”\nToday, Baek-seo brushed her hair more than usual.\nShe always tucked one side of her hair behind her ear.\nBut today, for some reason, she kept her hair covering both ears the entire time in the office.",

      "content": "Chapter 16 – Rule 9. The Leader Tests a New Power\nLightning Rod.\nA magical tool that stores lightning magic and allows the user to release it whenever desired.\nIt’s rare and very expensive. Not only is the manufacturing process highly complex, but acquiring the materials is also difficult.\nIn the outside world, there is a magical beast called the ‘Thunderbird.’\nIt stores lightning magic in its horn and releases it to attack when it feels threatened. It’s a dangerous bird beast.\nThe Thunderbird’s horn is the material for the Lightning Rod.\nIn other words, the rod-like section of the Lightning Rod is crafted from the Thunderbird’s large, sturdy horn.\n“How cool.”\nI thought as I admired the Lightning Rod’s brilliant appearance.\nAn ordinary person isn’t affected by their own magic.\nEven if I store a million volts in the Lightning Rod and stand right in the middle of it, I wouldn’t be harmed.\nBecause of this, the Lightning Rod is extremely useful for my combat style. It allows me to deliver a powerful strike to the enemy at critical moments.\n“I should test it out.”\nThe weekend.\nIt was a time when spring rain was drenching the ground.\nThe heavy rain loudly battered the paving stones.\nWhen I arrived at the spacious clearing, the pleasant smell of soil filled my lungs. Refreshing.\nI put down my umbrella under a tree and headed to the center of the clearing.\nAs I planted the handle of the Lightning Rod into the dirt, the heavy rain pouring from the gray sky soaked me completely. I felt a rare sense of liberation. Although I briefly worried about catching a cold due to the drop in body temperature, my body is strong, so I would be fine.\nThe long rod part pointed towards the sky.\nTo be precise, the Thunderbird’s horn.\nThe Lightning Rod was already fully charged with lightning magic. I could release the lightning magic anytime I wanted.\nI looked around.\nNo one was there.\nJust in case the Lightning Rod attracted lightning, I hid behind a distant tree.\n“Is this the feeling…?”\nI felt a strange sensation as if the Lightning Rod and I were connected.\nIt was like an invisible thread linking us.\nIt must be the interaction caused by my magic.\nI was sure that if I felt the sensation of pulling that thread, the Lightning Rod’s effect would activate.\nSo, I focused my mind to engrain the sensation of being connected to the Lightning Rod throughout my body.\n“Alright, I can feel it…”\n“What can you feel?”\n“!?”\nOh, damn.\nI was startled.\nWhen I quickly turned my head back, I saw a woman with a narrow-eyed smile looking at me.\nIt was Lee Se-Ah.\n“Lee Se-Ah…?”\nWhy is she here?\nWas she tailing me?\nCome to think of it, Se-Ah had already covered me with a red umbrella.\nI had been so focused on the sensation from the Lightning Rod that I noticed it late.\n“Senior, if you stay like that, you’ll catch a cold.”\nTo think she would stealthily find me and then worry about my health.\n‘Now that I think about it, ever since she found out I was monitoring her, we’ve been crossing paths more often.’\nWell, she is a potential villain.\nIt’s only natural to be wary of someone monitoring you.\nThis is troublesome.\n“It’s fine. You use it.”\nI gently pushed the umbrella back towards her.\n“Hmm? Senior.”\n“What?”\nSe-Ah tilted her head and asked.\n“You’re not as surprised as I thought you’d be. I came right up behind you, you know? You should at least pretend to be surprised.”\nAlthough her tone was playful, it was clear she was curious.\n‘I was surprised…’\nIt’s just the result of training my poker face.\nMy heart almost dropped.\nLee Se-Ah lightly poked my waist with her index finger.\n“If I were an enemy, you’d already be stabbed. Many people must be targeting you, considering you’re the Disciplinary Committee Leader.”\n“I knew you were tailing me. There’s no need to overreact to you.”\nIn truth, I didn’t know, but I judged it was likely and decided to lie accordingly.\nSe-Ah paused for a moment, then gave a profound smile.\n“Of course, that’s my senior for you.”\nIt was a meaningful smile.\n‘She takes it for granted…’\nLately, I’ve been feeling something.\nShe’s a fool.\nThat’s the conclusion I’ve reached after much consideration.\nOf course, I don’t mean a ‘fool’ in the purest sense.\nShe’s just far less wise than I expected.\nAs a future villain destined to become a titan of the black market, with great business acumen and extensive connections, I assumed she’d be very clever.\nI thought she’d possess the cunning and insight of a snake.\nJust look at her narrow eyes and sly smile.\nIsn’t she the epitome of a classic villain, appearing kind on the outside but wicked on the inside?\nHowever, after doing volunteer work together every week and chatting frequently on messenger, I’ve concluded…\nLee Se-Ah is simply someone with a lot of knowledge.\nKnowledge and wisdom are fundamentally different.\n‘Somehow… she seems less intimidating.’\nI’m not particularly bright, either.\nThe only reason I could maintain top grades was because the academy evaluates not just knowledge but also combat ability.\nOtherwise, no matter how much I studied through the night, my grades wouldn’t have reached the top tier.\nThat’s why villains with high intelligence were my primary concern….\nBut somehow, if it were Lee Se-Ah, I felt like I could easily stop her even if she became my enemy in the future.\nPerhaps because of that, she seemed less intimidating.\n“Are you perhaps thinking something disrespectful?”\n“!?”\nSe-Ah’s question, asked with her head tilted, brought tension back to my loosened guard.\nShe’s unnecessarily sharp when it comes to noticing if someone is badmouthing her.\nIt’s a keen insight, like a finely honed blade.\nAs expected of a potential villain.\nI can’t let my guard down.\n“I’m just kidding, senior.”\nSe-Ah laughed slyly.\nSmoothly handled.\n“And I just happened to see you while walking, so I followed you. I don’t know if you would call that tailing…. Well, from your perspective, it might look like stalking.”\n“Yeah…”\nSe-Ah smiled bashfully.\nI didn’t know if it was true or a lie, but it was meaningless to argue about it, so I decided to let it go.\n‘It’s probably a lie.’\nFrom the start, the whole picture didn’t look good.\nTo put it bluntly, it was like a stalker being stalked by another stalker.\nPointing out such details felt petty.\n“By the way, what were you doing?”\n“Testing a magical tool.”\n“A magical tool? That one?”\nSe-Ah looked at the Lightning Rod planted in the center of the clearing.\nShe was impressed.\n“Wow~, it’s a Lightning Rod? You got something good, senior!”\nAs expected, Se-Ah, with her extensive knowledge, knew about it.\n“It’s dangerous, so don’t get too close.”\n“Of course, I’ll stay right behind you, senior!”\n…Wait a minute.\n“But there’s no reason for you to watch this, right?”\n“I have a good reason. I’m quite bored right now.”\nWell, whatever.\n“…Don’t complain if you get hurt.”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“Cover your ears.”\n“Okay!”\nSe-Ah responded with a smile and covered her ears with both hands, using her arms to prop the umbrella on her shoulder.\n‘Now, let’s do this.’\nI closed my eyes and imagined grasping the invisible thread.\nAnd as I pulled that thread, I opened my eyes again.\n* * *",

      "content": "Chapter 16 (Continued)\nLee Se-Ah was aware of the practical use of the Lightning Rod.\nDespite being a rare magical tool, the Lightning Rod’s cost-effectiveness was inferior to mass-produced magic grenades.\nThe Lightning Rod’s magic discharge range was generally about 2 meters.\nWhether it was fully charged or not, it was usually around 2 meters. This could be considered a narrow range.\nThe more refined, pure, and concentrated the magic, the wider the attack radius becomes. It might be possible to expand the attack range to a meaningful level.\nHowever, this was an innate quality, so it was pointless to discuss it.\nIf Woo-jin had such extraordinary magic, he would already be aiming for the 5th or 6th rank or higher.\nOf course, it was an obvious fact that a Lightning Rod, which can store a large amount of magic, could exert more power than a magic grenade.\nBut considering how expensive, rare, and large it was, Se-Ah thought that a magic grenade, which fits in one hand and is easy to throw, would be more practical.\nZzzt!\nA teal current surged through the Lightning Rod.\nSoon, the energy condensed.\n“!!”\nBoom!!!\nWith an ear-splitting roar, the teal lightning magic expanded intensely.\nStartled, Woo-jin quickly turned and shielded Se-Ah.\nThe powerful lightning magic burst in all directions.\nBolts of lightning cut through the air sharply, striking distant trees like whips. Crack! The high-temperature energy struck instantly.\nThe lightning area expanded circularly from the Lightning Rod’s point. The speed gradually increased.\nCrack!\nThe destructive teal lightning heated the air.\nThe expanding lightning area gradually faded and finally merged into the air. The explosive reflection of lightning from the Lightning Rod also subsided instantly.\nPffft! The trees around the clearing, hit by the lightning, were charred black like coal.\nThe trees couldn’t stand anymore and collapsed into ashes.\nThud.\nThe sound stopped.\nThe pouring rain stabilized the air.\n“Are you hurt?”\nWoo-jin asked calmly, looking down at Se-Ah, who was crouching.\n“….”\nSe-Ah looked at Woo-jin with a dazed expression, then let out a dry laugh.\n“Fortunately, no.”\nSe-Ah stood up and looked around.\n“Wow….”\nSe-Ah let out an exclamation, her voice tinged with a wry laugh.\nThe surrounding scenery had transformed into a scene of devastation. The spring rain hadn’t yet extinguished the fires on the trees.\nIt was an unbelievable sight.\nZzt!\nTeal currents of electricity still flowed like an afterglow through the Lightning Rod.\nWoo-jin and Se-Ah stared at it in silence.\n“It seems practical enough, but….”\nWoo-jin couldn’t continue his sentence.\n‘What am I supposed to do about all this…?’\nLooking around, he felt utterly overwhelmed.\nMeanwhile, Se-Ah’s eyebrow twitched.\n“Practicality, huh….”\nIs this really the time to be considering practicality?\nThis wasn’t the power of the Lightning Rod that Se-Ah knew.\nIt had far surpassed any ordinary level.\nHow refined must the magic be?\nHow dense must the magic be?\nHow powerful must the magic be for the Lightning Rod to display such immense power?\nThis wasn’t the realm of a genius. It was a realm beyond even that. With such exceptional magic, it was inevitable that the efficiency, power, and everything related to magic would be on a completely different level.\nShe understood why Woo-jin, despite being at the 4th rank, could hold his own against those in the 5th rank. However, it still didn’t make sense that someone with this much magic was only at the 4th rank.\nThat alone was a startling mystery.\nYet, Woo-jin was casually mentioning ‘practicality.’\nSe-Ah couldn’t believe it.\n“Senior.”\n“What?”\n“Do you know the typical power level of a Lightning Rod?”\n“Isn’t this normal? It’s a rare magical tool.”\nSe-Ah swallowed her breath at the unexpected answer.\nCould it be that he’s been living his life considering such things normal…?\nThis situation was clearly not ordinary.\n“…Are you saying this isn’t normal?”\nReconsidering Se-Ah’s question, Woo-jin cautiously asked.\nSe-Ah nodded.\n“Not really.”\n“Hmm…. Thanks for letting me know.”\nWoo-jin, lost in thought, went to retrieve the Lightning Rod.\n“Ah. Senior, it’s still raining…!”\n“Don’t come. You might get electrocuted.”\nSe-Ah hesitated as she was about to cover Woo-jin with the umbrella.\nThe rain was pouring.\nApproaching the Lightning Rod could result in electrocution.\nWoo-jin pulled the Lightning Rod out of the ground and admired it. The rod still crackled menacingly with teal electricity.\n‘…This is awesome.’\nThe Lightning Rod’s power had far exceeded Woo-jin’s expectations.\nInitially, he thought it was because of the high rarity of the magical tool.\nBut if what Se-Ah said was true, it must have been due to his own magic.\nIt seemed that the effects of his years of training in magic techniques from a young age were now manifesting through the Lightning Rod.\nKnowing that the time he invested hadn’t been wasted filled him with satisfaction.\nNodding contentedly, Woo-jin secured the Lightning Rod to his belt. One side held a collapsible baton, and the other, the Lightning Rod.\nThen, a red umbrella was held over his head.\n“Senior, you’ll really catch a cold.”\nWoo-jin turned to look at Se-Ah.\n“…Junior, want some tteokbokki?”\n“Wow~, is this hush money?”\nSe-Ah laughed slyly, glancing around at the destruction.\nWoo-jin coughed and then continued calmly.\n“Of course not. Since we met anyway, it’s my duty as a senior to treat you. A junior covering me with an umbrella and worrying about me catching a cold, how can any senior not be moved?”\nHis words flowed smoothly.\n“If that’s the case, I’ll gladly accept.”\nSe-Ah smiled warmly.\nThat night.\nAfter making thorough preparations, Woo-jin returned to clean up the mess left by testing the Lightning Rod.\n“Huh?”\nSurprisingly, it had already been cleaned up.\nLater, Woo-jin would learn from the neighbors that people dressed in black had come and gone, equipped with various tools.\n* * *\n─ “Senior, if you stay like that, you’ll catch a cold.”\n“Cough! Cough!”\nHe caught one. A severe flu, no less.\n“Oh, this is killing me….”\nBzzzt.\n[ Vice-Leader Oh Baek-seo ]\nEven though his smartphone was vibrating, Woo-jin couldn’t move due to his high fever.\nThe vibration continued for a while before stopping, and two missed calls appeared on the screen.",

      "content": "Chapter 17 – Rule 10. The Leader Must Not Suffer from Influenza\nThe ominous signs appeared immediately upon waking. As soon as I got out of bed, my head felt like it was going to explode. My diaphragm tightened, and I felt nauseous. After urgently dealing with my bladder, I returned to bed like a soldier retreating to a safe zone. The ceiling filled my line of sight for a longer time than usual.\nI spent the time blankly, swallowing nasal mucus. Hunger and thirst gnawed at me, but I couldn’t move an inch from the bed. My throat was swollen. Swallowing the lukewarm saliva that constantly lingered in my mouth had become painful.\nI managed to use the thermometer I had brought with me. 39.4°C. It had been a while since I had the flu.\nRecently, my stock of medicine had run out. Neglecting to replenish it left me with a lingering regret.\nAt least it was the weekend. I couldn’t let the members see their leader unable to take care of himself. Even if I had somehow made it to school in this state, it would have only damaged my image. In the first place, attending school would have been difficult.\nI didn’t expect the members to understand. Perception and understanding are separate issues. I couldn’t let them imprint a weak image of me in their minds.\nI had to be an unyielding iron man. I had to reign as the perfect Disciplinary Committee Leader.\nOnly then would I not be overshadowed by the genius Oh Baek-seo.\n‘I hope… I’ll be okay by tomorrow.’\nI had to get better before the next day.\n“Cough! Cough!”\nEven putting a cold wet towel on my head would have been a relief, but in this condition, soaking the towel in water was a high-level task.\nBzzz.\nThe smartphone on the desk vibrated. A single vibration. A text message.\nUnfortunately, I couldn’t afford to reply.\nBzzzz.\nThe vibration lengthened. This time, it was a call. ‘I can’t take it.’ I decided to call back once I felt better. I didn’t even have the strength to lift a finger now.\nClick.\nThe vibration continued for a long time before it stopped. Silence returned.\n“……”\nMaybe it was because I had been buried in work since becoming the Disciplinary Committee Leader. Spending time endlessly in pain brought back various forgotten memories.\nI was reincarnated as a nameless extra in a game. I was one of the many beings born through artificial insemination, with genes randomly selected by AI from a factory’s storage. The amniotic sac I was in was an incubator, and my mother was a nurturing robot.\nWhen I reached the age to perceive objects, I completed the common educational process everyone underwent. During that time, the AI instilled the mission, ‘You must rejuvenate humanity,’ into our minds through rote learning. This mandate was established as the value pursued by Academy City. If it weren’t for my game knowledge, I might have regarded that mandate as the ultimate ideology.\nBesides that, I learned how to live and was given a house to live in when I reached the age of an elementary school student. It was the beginning of independent living.\nChildren at that age received excessive protection from security robots roaming the streets. In Academy City, where the social system was still imperfect, young children often became targets of crime.\nThe security robots, usually performing the functions of cleaning robots, also had combat capabilities. They had a rather endearing appearance. I, too, was overprotected by them.\nHowever, I couldn’t feel human warmth from these unfeeling robots. I wished for anyone to be a friend or at least a neighbor. Then I met a girl. One day, when white snow covered Academy City, her light pink hair fluttered in the winter wind.\nThe girl introduced herself as Kim Eun-ha. It was an alias. I later learned that she was Kim Dalbi, one of the Six Sinners. At that time, knowing nothing, I was just happy to have a human friend.\nWhether Dalbi felt the same as I did or was just killing time, she treated me kindly. We quickly became close. She was the first person to be on my side since I was reincarnated in this world.\nJust the fact that she was the first person on my side made Dalbi a special existence to me. Shielded by the excuse of being a child, I frequently expressed my affection, often saying I liked her and giving her flowers and handwritten letters. I wanted Dalbi to stay by my side.\nPerhaps grateful for my sincerity, Dalbi often visited my house and took care of many things for me.\nShe made delicious dishes with hands covered in bandages, claiming to have learned from the internet, and brought new toys and cool robots, saying she had found them by chance on her way.\nDalbi loved being held. Whenever she got a chance, she would stretch her arms sideways, signaling for a hug.\nWhile we hugged each other tightly like penguins in the winter wind, it was natural to envision a future together with that child. It was a dream that lasted only three years.\nDalbi left my side, leaving behind only the words that she loved my innocence.\nI still don’t understand the true meaning behind those words.\nOn the cabinet beside my bed, a peony flower talisman was framed. Even a slight turn of my head brings that talisman into view.\nWhy did Dalbi, after leaving my side, leave a letter at my house years later? Why did she congratulate me on getting into Ahsung High School with a peony flower?\nI still couldn’t understand that.\nI thought I had let go of Dalbi, but when I reminisced alone, she still lingered in my mind.\nWas it because she was the first person to be on my side, because she was someone I invested my emotions in, or because my body was so young at that time that even my mind naively clung to her?\nThe memories with Dalbi, which I thought had burnt out, quietly rekindled at some point, leaving an afterglow.\nDrowsiness welled up amidst the pain. I quietly closed my eyes.\n“……”\nI must have been in a deep sleep.\nAs I opened my eyes slightly, I vaguely saw a woman with flowing pale pink hair.\nI couldn’t tell if it was a dream or reality. I felt incredibly dazed, so I closed my eyes again.\nSomething damp was placed on my forehead. It was cold. The faint smell of porridge filled my senses.\nI felt someone holding my hand tightly and stroking my hair. Suddenly, I realized I wasn’t alone.\nSoon, a gentle voice resonated in my ears.\n“Sorry for coming over.”\nFor some reason, she left an apology. I opened my eyes slightly again.\nThe warmth that I had felt in my hand was gone. Her gaze lingered on the nightstand next to the bed for a while. When I closed my eyes again, I heard the sound of her footsteps gradually fade away.\nImmediately after, I sank into a deeper sleep.\n……\nWhen I regained consciousness, I heard the sound of something being dipped in water nearby. Soon, a cool towel was placed on my forehead.\nAs I slowly opened my eyes, a familiar face came into view.\n“You’re awake?”\nA kind smile. It was Baek-seo.\n“?”\nWhy was Baek-seo here? At that moment, an instinctive thought flashed through my mind: the folder of bush warblers on my computer’s hard drive. I was relieved, remembering that I had set a password on my computer just in case.\n“Baek-seo…? How did you get here?”",

She was wearing an off-shoulder top and a flowy skirt that reached her knees. Her coat was hanging on the clothes rack.\n“I came because I couldn’t reach you.”\nI remembered my smartphone ringing several times. It must have been Baekseo calling.\n“How did you know my house’s password?”\n“Last year, I had to come to the department head’s house to pick something up, and you gave me the password over the phone. Don’t you remember?”\n“Oh… right.”\nShe still remembered that.\n“……”\nI didn’t have the energy to maintain my usual poker face. I didn’t want to show such a weakened state.\nStill, I felt at ease with Baekseo here. It must have been tough dealing with the flu.\n“Should I bring you some porridge?”\nPorridge? Did she buy it? Or did she make it? Now that I think about it, I remembered smelling porridge in my dream. Had I smelled it while Baekseo was making it?\n‘I am pretty hungry.’\nJust hearing about the porridge made me feel extremely hungry.\nI turned my head towards the window. The sky was turning a deep navy blue. It was evening.\nOnly then did I realize that I hadn’t eaten anything all day.\nI looked back at Baek-seo.\n“Uh… I’d like that.”\n“Wait a moment.”\nBaek-seo brought a bowl of fluffy porridge made from soaked rice and a stainless steel spoon from the kitchen. She also brought small dishes of soy sauce and sesame oil.\n“Ugh…”\nI carefully sat up. A headache hit me, but I could feel that my body had improved slightly thanks to the care I received while I was asleep.\n“Leader.”\nBaek-seo scooped a spoonful of the white porridge and blew on it to cool it down.\n“Ah~”\n“……”\nBaek-seo held the spoon out to me as if she were feeding a child.\nFor a moment, I almost opened my mouth, but then the words Baekseo had recently said to me flashed through my mind.\n─ ‘I’ve come to realize that I need to take care of the department head myself.’\nNo. This isn’t right…!\n“…I’ll feed myself.”\n“Will you?”\nI took the spoon and the bowl of porridge from Baek-seo and began eating it myself.\nDespite the plain taste of the porridge, it felt incredibly delicious.\nI added some soy sauce and sesame oil to it, then took another spoonful. The seasoning was just right, which made my appetite even stronger.\nBaek-seo watched me eat with a satisfied look. Was she my mom or something?\n“Baek-seo.”\nStill, I had to say this.\n“Thank you.”\n“For what?”\n“For coming over.”\nIt wasn’t just a polite gesture. I meant it sincerely.\nI am not a superhuman. I just need to appear as one in the Disciplinary Committee, but in reality, I am an ordinary person. I was reminded of how lonely one can feel when they are sick. I suppose that’s why I was so fond of Dalbi, my first friend.\nEven though it hurt my pride to show such a vulnerable side to Baekseo, I was deeply moved by her coming to take care of me when I was suffering alone.\nBaek-seo smiled and shook her head.\n“No, if the department head is sick, of course I should come. Besides, it’s nice to visit your place again after so long.”\n“Why my place?”\n“Isn’t it fun to visit a friend’s house?”\nI chuckled.\n“Yeah, I guess so.”\n“If you want to come over, you’re always welcome.”\n“Huh?”\n“You’re always welcome. Anytime.”\nAs I said this while eating the porridge, Baekseo suddenly fell silent.\n‘…Why isn’t she saying anything?’\nWhy so quiet? Did I say something wrong?\nI glanced at Baek-seo. For some reason, she looked contemplative.\n“Anytime?”\nBaekseo asked again, her expression becoming serious.\nI nodded.\n“Is that strange?”\n“Well, that’s practically living together…”\n“?”\nMaybe it was because my head wasn’t working properly due to the flu, but I couldn’t understand why she came to that conclusion.\n……\nAfter taking some new medicine Baekseo brought and lying down again, she continued to take care of me diligently as the night wore on. I lost count of how many times I imagined how happy I would be if I married someone like her.\nShe even placed her hand on my abdomen over the blanket and gently patted it. I could tell she was trying to alleviate my discomfort.\nIt was past midnight. Baekseo was reading a book she had brought from my room.\n“Baek-seo.”\n“Yes, Leader?”\nBaekseo looked up from her book immediately upon hearing my call, responding with a gentle smile. She repeatedly tapped the book quietly with her index finger.\n“You can go home now. It’s late.”\n“I’ll stay until you’re better. We need to go to school together tomorrow.”\nReally. She’s such a kind person.\nBut this was burdensome for me. She needed to go home before the last train.\nSleepiness was coming over me again, so I had to send Baekseo off before I fell asleep.\n“It’s okay. I think I’ll get better if I sleep now…. I owe you a lot today. You gave me a wet towel and made porridge….”\nBaekseo’s finger stopped tapping the book.\nFor a brief moment, her eyes seemed to widen slightly.\nShe quickly returned to her usual expression, but I didn’t miss that subtle change. It was too dramatic to ignore.\n“What’s wrong?”\n“…Nothing.”\nBaekseo shook her head and closed the book. Was her reaction just a coincidence?\n“Are you sleepy?”\nBaekseo asked, placing her hand on the blanket again and gently patting me.\n“Yeah, sorry, but I need to sleep. You should head home….”\n“Don’t worry about me.”\n“Go home before the last train. I feel bad for keeping you here.”\nI had shown enough of my disheveled self. I didn’t want her to see me falling asleep in this condition.\n“…Okay. I’ll stay until you fall asleep.”\n“Alright….”\n“Should I sing you a lullaby?”\n“Don’t do that.”\nHearing a lullaby would make me feel even more pathetic.\nBaekseo seemed to be joking and smiled warmly.\nI closed my eyes. Thanks to Baekseo’s gentle patting, I soon drifted off to sleep.\n* * *\n“…….”\nOh Baekseo quietly watched Ahn Woo-jin as he fell asleep. After a few minutes, Woo-jin was completely asleep.\nThe gentle smile on Baek-seo’s face gradually faded. She headed straight to the kitchen.\nShe opened the lid of the silver pot on the gas stove, revealing the white porridge inside. It was perfectly cooked, with no issues at all.\n“It wasn’t Woo-jin who made it….”\nBaek-seo muttered softly.\nHer eyes gradually darkened.",

      "content": "Chapter 18 – Rule 11. The Leader Eliminates the Villain Group (1)\nAmong the destroyed hologram robots, a man was chomping down on raw cultivated meat.\nA giant over 190 cm tall. A long-haired man with muscles on the verge of bursting.\nAround him were traces of explosions.\nNext to him stood a petite female student with her hands in her pockets, wearing a hoodie. They looked like a giant and a dwarf.\n“Is the test over now?”\nThe girl took off her hoodie and asked bluntly to the man beyond the reinforced glass. The holograms turned off, and the robots’ shapes disappeared.\nThrough the now transparent glass, the man’s appearance became clear. He had a short buzz cut, was dressed in combat gear, and wore a coat. On his combat gear was the logo of Anomia.\n“Yeah. Still impressive. Lee Ji-Soo, Jang Ha-Moon.”\nHe smiled.\n“Now, tell me, Chief. Why did you call us here for a test without any warning?”\nWhen Ji-Soo asked, the man in combat gear, the leader of Anomia, manipulated a remote control.\nBeep. A screen appeared on the glass.\nIt was a recently famous video of the Sindo-rim Swordmaster sparring. In the video, a male student in a black uniform was sparring with a truncheon wrapped in turquoise lightning power.\nJi-Soo and the giant Jang Ha-Moon watched the video silently.\nEventually, the sparring in the video ended. The last person standing in the sparring arena was a male student in a black uniform, the Disciplinary Committee Leader of Ahsung High School, Ahn Woo-jin.\nThe leader paused the video.\n“So what?”\n“We’re going to capture him.”\nJi-Soo’s face showed confusion.\n“What!? Are you insane…? That’s the Disciplinary Committee Leader of Ahsung High School, right? Are you trying to poke a beehive? The Disciplinary Committee won’t just stand by…”\n“This guy anticipated our plan and moved accordingly. He even managed to secretly monitor our activities. And what happened? Our guys got caught in droves, didn’t they?”\nThe leader continued.\n“We can’t leave someone like him alone.”\n“Ridiculous.”\nJi-Soo snorted in disbelief.\n“So? Since we can’t figure out how he discovered and monitored our plans, you’re just going to hit him directly? Even if he’s part of a hornet’s nest that could crush us?”\n“Whether we figure out his methods or not, my conclusion remains the same. Since he’s trying to thwart our plans with such outstanding intelligence skills, we have no choice but to fight.”\n“Did you ever think about waiting until his term as leader ends?”\nThe leader manipulated the remote control again.\nThe 45th Ahsung High School Disciplinary Committee Leader’s inauguration ceremony video appeared. It was a video available on Ahsung High School’s website. In the video, Ahn Woo-jin was giving a speech in a determined tone, pledging to contribute to maintaining peace.\n“He’s not just talk. This guy is the real deal. With such meticulous preliminary work and a history of blocking Anomia’s path, do you think he would leave us alone until his term ends?”\nAhn Woo-jin’s resolute eyes and cynical voice. His aggressive speech.\nAll of this, combined with his outstanding intelligence skills, instilled strong tension in the Anomia leader.\n“Moreover, he outperformed the genius Oh Baek-Seo to become the Disciplinary Committee Leader of Ahsung High School. Even Oh Baek-Seo follows his orders as if they’re law. Although Woo-jin may not surpass Baek-Seo in sheer force, it means he has the capability to dominate Baek-Seo in other areas.”\nAn enemy with apparent strength can be planned against.\nAn enemy with unknown strength is terrifying because you don’t know how to counter them.\nThat’s the difference between Oh Baek-Seo and Ahn Woo-jin, and why the Anomia leader highly valued Ahn Woo-jin’s abilities.\nTherefore.\n“Before we get blindsided, we strike first. Then, before Oh Baek-Seo can intervene, we withdraw and reorganize. No matter how strong the Ahsung High School Disciplinary Committee Leader is, he’s only ranked 4th level. You 5th level members alone can beat him, and with additional firepower, you can handle any unforeseen circumstances.”\nJi-Soo sighed and then chuckled.\n“Fine, fine. If you say so. So, how do we lure him out?”\n“Kidnap the secretary. He’s the least useful yet closest to the Disciplinary Committee Leader of Ahsung High School. Wait until he’s out of the police drones’ sight.”\n“Got it. Taking down the Disciplinary Committee Leader… If we succeed, our notoriety will skyrocket. …Sounds quite fun.”\nJi-Soo, along with Ha-Moon who growled like a beast, decided to follow the leader’s orders as Anomia’s officers.\n……\nPark Minhyuk, the secretary of Ahsung High School’s Disciplinary Committee, had a hobby he couldn’t tell anyone about.\nHe visited a figure shop wearing round glasses and a raincoat.\nA bright smile spread across his face as if he had entered heaven. Even the rubbery smell inside the shop was fragrant to him.\nLooking at the character figures displayed, Minhyuk grinned. He picked up a box of items from the event section and bought it with the money he had saved from his part-time job.\nFinally, he got his hands on the latest figure of Marina, the iron-blooded girl, which he had vowed to obtain this month. He put the figure box inside his raincoat and hugged it tightly as he left the shop.\nThinking about placing the figure at the center of his display shelf in his room made him smile.\nWorried about running into someone he knew, Minhyuk took a less-traveled path he knew.\nEventually.\nThud!\n“Ugh!”\nA steel rod enveloped in magic struck Minhyuk.\n* * *\nThe sky outside the window was ash-colored.\nThe light pink cherry blossoms that had been blooming beautifully had all fallen with the spring rain.\nAccording to the weather forecast, it was going to be cloudy and rainy all week. It was a relief that the cherry blossom viewing had ended last week.\n‘Spring rain…’\nAt this time, a thought crossed my mind.\n“Leader, don’t be surprised. I’m starting my diet again today!”\nIgnoring Ha Yesong’s 1420216th diet declaration, I thought.\n‘What is Anomia up to right now?’\nThe subway kidnapping incident that occurred on the first day of this semester’s opening ceremony.\nIn the game, this incident was the catalyst that involved Anomia with the original protagonist, Lee Taesung. Anomia sent officers to retaliate against Lee Taesung for thwarting their plans.\n“It’s true! Please don’t ignore me…!”\nThe problem was, in reality, I was the one who resolved the subway event.\nIt was only natural that Anomia would target me for their retaliation.\nHowever, I hadn’t seen any sign of Anomia’s officers around me. No suspicious circumstances were detected. Despite it being the time when their officers should have already appeared.\n“Let’s bet again this time! President?”\nI am the leader of the Disciplinary Committee, ranked number one in Ahsung High School in terms of combat power.\nIt’s not unreasonable to be considered a bigger threat than the original protagonist. They might be trying to approach more cautiously.\n“Leee..ader…!?”\nOf course, rather than repeatedly worrying about this, there was also the option of boldly attacking Anomia first.\nBut they frequently moved their base. It was difficult to pinpoint their exact location. Even the base I learned about from interrogating the ones caught during the subway kidnapping incident was empty when we got there.\nMoreover, there was a significant difference between the map scale in the game and the actual city size. Aside from familiar places, my game knowledge wasn’t very helpful.\n“…….”\nSo what should I do….\n“Leader?”\nWhile I was deep in thought, someone tapped my shoulder gently. It was Vice President Oh Baek-Seo.\nBaek-Seo looked at me with the usual gentle smile.\n“Why?”\n“What are you thinking about so hard?”\n“Just thinking about work.”\nIt wasn’t a lie.\nAfter all, Anomia was eventually an organization that needed to be captured by the Disciplinary Committee.\n“But where’s Yesong?”\nThe chatterbox who was in front of me earlier had disappeared.\n“She just got a call from a friend in the culinary club inviting her to eat chicken, so she left. She thought you were focused on work and didn’t want to disturb you.”\n“I should have bet with her.”\nIf I had known her diet would fail in just a few minutes, I should have stopped thinking and bet with her.\n“Shall we wrap up and go home?”\nBaek-Seo asked as she cleared the empty cup on my desk.\nI had some free time for a change. It would be nice to leave early and rest well on such a day. Although, calling it ‘early’ was a bit of a stretch considering the time.\n“Let’s do that.”\nWe quickly organized the documents.\nThen Baek-Seo asked,\n“Leader, do you have an umbrella?”\n“Yeah, I do.”\nHaving caught a cold recently made me cautious about carrying an umbrella. It made me vigilant. Of course, I had recovered from the cold.\n“If you have two, could you lend me one?”\n“I only have one. But there are always some umbrellas left by students. Just borrow one of those…. Hm?”\nWhy?\nThere was no umbrella left in the stand except for mine.\nThere were usually several umbrellas left by students whose owners were unknown. Where did they all go?\n“It looks like the students took them because it’s been raining lately.”\n“But there should have been at least one or two left…?”\n“Maybe they took them home.”\nIt didn’t seem right.\nGiven the situation, it was hard to disagree with Baek-Seo.\n“If you need one, I can get one from the classroom. There should be some spare ones in our class.”\n“Isn’t it time when there’s no one in the classroom? As a member of the Disciplinary Committee, it’s not proper to use someone else’s belongings without permission.”\n“?”",

      "content": "Chapter 18 (Continued)\nBaek-Seo quickly rebutted with a smiling face. Her tone was clear and smooth.\nI was at a loss for words.\n“…….”\nI rubbed my chin and thought.\nShe was right. I couldn’t logically argue against her.\nWe left the room and headed towards the entrance. It was still drizzling.\nI opened the umbrella, and Baek-Seo slowly stepped under it.\n“Excuse me.”\n“Oh? Oh.”\nBaek-Seo smiled brightly. Her shoulder touched mine, and her pleasant scent cut through the earthy smell, filling my senses.\nAn unexpected tension arose. I hadn’t been paying attention to the fact that I would have to share an umbrella with Baek-Seo while thinking about Anomia.\n‘Isn’t this something that couples or people in a relationship would do…?’\nIt had been a long time since I shared an umbrella with a girl, since Kim Dalbi, and I overlooked it.\nAs we started walking, my mouth went dry. My body felt stiff.\nIf any passing students saw this, they might get the wrong idea.\nFortunately, it was late, and the rain meant there were fewer students around than usual. But the unease was unavoidable.\n‘I can’t just give her the umbrella and walk alone, and buying one at a convenience store feels like a waste of money…’\nThe best option was to go home quietly and discreetly.\nThe rain was loud and heavy.\n“…….”\nOur arms kept brushing against each other. Sharing one umbrella made physical contact unavoidable.\nWhen I tried to step away, my shoulder got wet from the rain.\n“Leader.”\n“Why?”\nBaek-Seo’s soft voice gently pierced through the sound of the rain.\n“Are you worried about looking like a couple?”\n“!”\nI flinched, my head dropping without even realizing it. It was a question that pierced through my psyche like a dagger.\nI thought I was maintaining a poker face. Did it show?\nOr was it just a coincidence that she voiced a doubt I might have been harboring?\nRegardless, I answered as casually as I could, pretending to be unaffected.\n“It’s not an appropriate look for the Disciplinary Committee Leader and Vice Leader. You didn’t have an umbrella, so we had no choice.”\n“I don’t mind, even if we get misunderstood.”\n“But I do….”\nBaek-Seo’s radiance was too strong to be damaged by something like this, but as the leader, my dignity could be compromised.\n“Fufu.”\nBaek-Seo let out a low laugh, sidled closer to me, and grabbed the end of the umbrella handle that I was holding. She tilted the umbrella towards me.\nMy shoulder stayed dry, but hers started to get wet.\n‘I should have bought a bigger umbrella.’\nShe’s really considerate. Baek-Seo never loses when it comes to showing concern for others. So, I had no choice but to walk closely with her to avoid getting wet.\nBaek-Seo’s elbow naturally came up on top of mine. We got even closer.\nUnintentionally, my elbow brushed against Baek-Seo’s underarm several times, feeling a soft and somewhat embarrassing sensation. However, she didn’t show any reaction.\nShe just kept her usual gentle smile and walked briskly.\nAt some point, I realized there had been a silence between us. I hadn’t noticed the awkward atmosphere because of my own tension.\n“I think I understand something.”\nEventually, Baek-Seo spoke softly.\n“Understand what?”\n“Why people misunderstand when a boy and a girl share an umbrella.”\n“?”\nWhy would she say that?\nI couldn’t quite grasp her intentions.\nBaek-Seo’s face always wore a gentle smile. But she might be feeling the same as me. This situation was quite nerve-wracking…\n“That’s…”\nJust as I was about to respond,\nVrrr.\nMy smartphone vibrated in my uniform pocket.\n“Hold on.”\nI wasn’t sure what to say, so I used the phone as an excuse to buy some time to think.\nI took out my smartphone. There was a text message from Secretary Park Minhyuk.\n“……?”\nThe message contained a photo of Minhyuk, bruised and lying on the ground. My steps halted.\n“Leader?”\nBaek-Seo also stopped, looking at me with a puzzled expression.\nMore messages arrived. There were coordinates and a message.\n[The secretary is here]\n[Bring people or call for support]\n[Imagine what will happen to this guy]\n“Baek-Seo.”\n“Yes?”\n“I have somewhere to go.”\nI didn’t have any other thoughts.\nMy mind just went cold.\n* * *\nA high-rise building stood tall on the outskirts of Academy City.\nUsually, it appeared as an abandoned building, looking like construction had halted just before completion. But its interior was intact.\nHowever, today, combat drones and turrets were set up around the building, and armed Anomia members were standing guard. The forces were concentrated especially at the front entrance.\nA gathering of forces. An explicit state of alert.\nThis was the building where Secretary Park Minhyuk had been taken. The name inscribed at the front was ‘Grey Star’.\nMeanwhile, in an office, Anomia’s leader, dressed in combat gear and a luxurious coat, was reclining with his feet on the desk, sipping whiskey.\nHe had confirmed through drones that Ahsung High School’s Disciplinary Committee Leader, Ahn Woo-jin, was heading alone towards Grey Star. Now, Anomia would launch an all-out attack to deal with him, then retreat before Oh Baek-Seo could intervene.\nThere was a good chance Ahn Woo-jin had called for support. Although there was no sign of activity from Ahsung High School yet, if Ahn Woo-jin managed to rescue the secretary, the Disciplinary Committee might stealthily prepare and head to Grey Star.\nBut even with that risk, Ahn Woo-jin had to be dealt with. The Anomia leader considered Ahn Woo-jin a significant threat due to his intelligence capabilities.\nHe had prepared for a retreat just in case. Even if the Disciplinary Committee deployed, they would be distant enough to give his forces ample time to escape. That’s why they chose the outskirts-located Grey Star as their battleground.\nBesides, Ahn Woo-jin had to pay for interfering with Anomia.\nThe leader thought so, sneering.\nVrrr.\nThe burner phone on the table vibrated. The caller ID was from Grey Star’s control room. The leader answered the call.\n“Has Ahsung High School’s Disciplinary Committee Leader arrived?”\n─ Y-yes, he has…!\nWhy was his voice trembling?\nThe leader paused his doubt and continued with a hint of laughter.\n“He must be trying to sneak into the building, right? He wouldn’t commit a suicidal act by charging the front entrance alone after seeing the strength of our forces.”\n─ He came through the front entrance….\n“…What?”\nThe leader frowned.\n“That can’t be right…?”\nNo matter how strong Ahn Woo-jin was, he was a 4th-level at best.\nAfter seeing the forces at Grey Star, it was only natural for him to avoid a direct confrontation. It was impossible for a 4th-level alone to break through those forces.\n‘He can’t be so foolish as to not realize his limits…’\nAnd then.\n─ Boss!\nThe subordinate in the control room urgently reported.\n─ Most of the front entrance forces are down! They can’t hold him off…!\nThe leader’s eyes widened in shock.",

      "content": "Chapter 19 – Rule 11. The Leader Eliminates the Villain Group (2)\nAnomia’s goal is revenge.\nThere may be other objectives, but ultimately, Ahn Woo-jin is clearly their target.\nThus, they must have kidnapped the secretary as bait.\nWoo-jin recalled his game knowledge.\nAnomia is a villain group with a lower risk level compared to the Six Sinners.\nHowever, their scale is significant, and they possess some formidable forces.\nThe most dangerous individual to watch out for is the highest-ranking officer, AQ.\nHowever, the likelihood of AQ being at Gray Star was close to zero.\nThis is because AQ, being a coward, always stayed close to the leader for protection.\nAnomia’s leader would likely be far from the danger zone, observing the situation like a visitor at a zoo.\nThanks to this, Woo-jin could guess the leader’s location.\nGray Star was a building where the Anomia eradication operation took place during the first semester of the second year in the original game.\nThere, Anomia’s leader directed his subordinates and fought the protagonists as if playing chess.\nWoo-jin remembered exactly where that happened.\nRecalling the original story was easy for him.\nTherefore, Woo-jin entrusted the highest-ranking officer AQ and Anomia’s leader to Ahsung High’s strongest, the Vice-Leader of the Disciplinary Committee, Oh Baek-seo.\nAs for the remaining Anomia forces, Woo-jin estimated that even without Oh Baek-seo, he could handle the forces gathered at Gray Star.\nEventually, the moment Woo-jin rescued the Disciplinary Committee Secretary Park Minhyuk, Anomia would be facing imminent defeat.\nEach step splashed water from the rain-soaked ground. The dark clouds filling the night sky continued to pour down rain.\nWoo-jin put a wireless earphone in his right ear and spoke calmly.\n“We’ve reached the destination. From now on, we’ll begin the operation to rescue the\nsecretary and eliminate Anomia.”\n– “Roger.”\n– “Yes, sir!”\n– “Understood.”\nThe responses from Vice-Leader Oh Baek-seo, Disorder Control Officer Ha Yesong, and treasurer Yoo Doha resonated in his ears.\nWoo-jin arrived at the front entrance of the Gray Star building.\nWhirr. Several combat turrets and a swarm of drones in the sky recognized Woo-jin.\nAn armed Anomia force also took up weapons, surrounded by magical energy, and warily eyed Woo-jin.\n“He’s here. It’s the Disciplinary Committee Leader from Ahsung High.”\n“Is that…?”\n“Wait, he’s coming through the front entrance?”\n“Is he trying to get himself killed? What a joke.”\n“Something feels off…”\nAmong the forces at the front gate, the relatively stronger ones unconsciously swallowed their dry throats.\nA mysterious sense of intimidation was emanating from Woo-jin.\nSuddenly, their instincts screamed.\nDespite being numerically superior and having combat robots, they felt they couldn’t win against the black-clad man advancing through the night.\nTzzzt.\nIn the darkness, Woo-jin’s teal eyes glowed and crackled with electricity. It was the activation of his magical power.\nHe drew out the two handles fixed to his belt. With a crosswise downward swing, iron rods emerged from each handle.\nOne was a black telescopic baton.\nIt was the equipment used to subdue the Anomia forces stationed in the train before.\nCrackle! Teal patterns were etched on its surface following the magic circuit, and Woo-jin’s lightning magic surged.\nThe other was the Lightning Rod.\nA powerful explosive-type magical weapon that discharged lightning energy.\nIt emitted a faint teal current, ready to unleash its stored magical power at any moment.\nFinally, as Woo-jin stepped into the front entrance, all lights focused on him, as if indicating the target for concentrated attacks.\nStanding still, Woo-jin glared icily at the enemies targeting him.\nWith the air taut and all of Anomia’s forces tensed, the platoon leader at the front gate shouted.\n“Everyone, attack!!”\nUsing that command as a signal flare, the turrets and drones switched to combat mode, their eyes glowing red.\nZzzz! Combat robots condensed their magic, firing beams or launching small missiles. Woo-jin propelled himself off the ground, instantly accelerating to evade the barrage.\nBoom! A meaningless explosion covered the ground with dust and debris.\nThe turrets and drones simultaneously tracked Woo-jin’s biological response, and Anomia’s armed forces charged towards Woo-jin, each having strengthened their bodies with magic.\nCrackle!\nAn Anomia soldier of the 4th Tier attacked Woo-jin with an electric sword. Clang! Woo-jin blocked the sword strike with his telescopic baton.\nThud!\n“Agh!”\nImmediately, a teal trajectory cut through the night rain and struck the soldier’s hand. Crunch! His hand bone shattered, dropping the sword.\nThe telescopic baton drew a heavy arc in a follow-up swing.\nThud!!\nThe thrust released a shockwave of electricity, sending the enemy flying. His ribs shattered like powder in an instant.\nCrackle! The shockwave-induced electricity flowed along the pouring rain in multiple streams.\nThe surrounding enemies, soaked by the rain, were electrocuted in clusters.\n“Grrgh!”\n“Argh!”\nSwiftly moving, Woo-jin struck the paralyzed enemies with his baton.\nThud!\nThud!\nThud!\nIn an instant, ten enemies, including the 4th-Tier officer, fell.\nWhenever Anomia’s forces dropped their weapons, Woo-jin deftly snatched them and threw them accurately at turrets or drones.\nThud! A spear pierced straight through the air and skewered a turret precisely.\nWhirr! A spinning axe split another turret’s muzzle in half.\nEach turret sparked and then extinguished their lights, bowing down.\nDespite the drones’ concentrated fire, Woo-jin dodged calmly, moving gracefully as if reading the trajectory of each bullet.\nEach swing of the baton released a shockwave.\nWith every swing, vivid sparks flew, and unending screams echoed as enemies collapsed one by one.\nHowever, this battlefield was open, unlike the narrow train.\n“Surround him!”\nGradually, Anomia’s forces encircled Woo-jin, continuing their attack.\nIf this continued, there would inevitably be a moment when Woo-jin would be caught off guard.\nDefeating him would just be a matter of time.\n…That was a misconception.\nFlash!\n“!?”\nWoo-jin, utilizing his magically enhanced strength, stepped on an Anomia soldier’s head and launched himself into the air. His movements were as agile as a squirrel. He escaped the encirclement by jumping up walls and structures.\nSoaring to a high vantage point in one leap, Woo-jin spun in midair, looking down at the clustered Anomia forces.\nCrackle!!\nWoo-jin’s other weapon, the Lightning Rod, unleashed a storm of electricity.\nTeal bolts of lightning spread through the air like tree roots, slicing and swirling. Boom! In Woo-jin’s hand, the Lightning Rod maintained its robust form, shining with steadfast electric energy.\nFrom a young age, Woo-jin had mastered a high concentration of magical power through his mana training method. This high-purity mana now flowed unchecked through the Lightning Rod’s magic circuit and was being released.\nIt was the moment when the Lightning Rod’s potential was fully unleashed.\n“What the hell…?”\nThe Anomia forces watched in shock, unable to close their mouths.\nThey couldn’t even think of how to counter it.\nHow could they possibly stop that?\nSoon, Woo-jin hurled the Lightning Rod at them.\nThe image of a lightning bolt cutting through the air was imprinted on everyone’s retinas in an instant.\nA flash of light.\nThe Lightning Rod, shaped like a bolt of lightning, struck the ground.\nBoom!!!\n“Aaagh!!”\n“Nooo!!”\nThe wave of lightning swept away the spring rain.\nThe condensed explosion of mana and bundles of lightning instantly engulfed, scorched, and shattered the enemies.\nAs the electricity subsided, the Anomia forces fell to the ground, steaming and powerless.\nThough they didn’t lose their lives thanks to their magically enhanced bodies, the pain forced them to pass out. Woo-jin had adjusted his strength deliberately.\nThe drones met a similar fate.\nThey all sparked, lost functionality, and crashed to the ground.\nThud! Thud! The drones shattered into pieces upon impact.\nTzzzt, tzzzt. Woo-jin landed lightly on the ground, which was still coursing with teal currents.\nHe surveyed his surroundings.\nThe numerous enemies guarding the front gate were collapsed, occasionally twitching.\nThe front gate force had been annihilated.\nAbove them stood Woo-jin alone.\n“…”\nWoo-jin picked up the Lightning Rod, recharging it with his lightning mana, and calmly entered the Gray Star building.\n***",

      "content": "Chapter 19 (Continued)\nMeanwhile,\n“That’s the Lightning Rod…?”\nAnomia’s leader, watching the battle at the front gate through the screen, couldn’t close his mouth.\n“We didn’t receive any information that he had the Lightning Rod. More importantly, is it possible for the Lightning Rod to have that much power…?”\nEven with the rainy weather, the Lightning Rod’s power shouldn’t have been that strong.\nThis was far beyond normal.\nThe fact that the Lightning Rod’s power was so amplified meant that very little mana was filtered through its magic circuit. Or perhaps none at all.\nThis implied that the purity of his mana was exceptionally high.\nMana purity equated to potential.\nIt enabled superior performance in all areas of mana manipulation.\nAlso, the higher the mana purity, the greater the possibility of reaching higher levels.\nThat someone like him was still at the 4th Tier was unbelievable.\n“Tsk.”\nThe leader clicked his tongue.\nUnderestimating Woo-jin’s combat abilities was a grievous mistake.\nHowever, he still had enough trust in his contingencies.\n“He won’t get through the traps unscathed.”\nSeveral traps were set up inside Gray Star.\nThey were prepared for a prolonged engagement if necessary.\nMana-detonating mines, hidden turrets in the shadows, and various other lethal traps aimed at Woo-jin’s life.\nOne or two traps might be insignificant to Woo-jin, but accumulated damage would eventually lead to victory.\nThe leader thought so and smiled.\nWhirr.\nThe burner phone rang again.\nIt was the control room of Gray Star.\nThe leader answered the call.\n“What is it?”\n– “L-Leader…! The traps…!”\n“The traps?”\n– “They’re all being bypassed!”\n“What?”\nThe leader couldn’t believe his ears.\n– “It’s as if he knows where all the traps are! He’s dismantling them all! It’s unbelievable…!”\nThe voice from the control room trembled.\nThe leader was bewildered.\n“How is that possible?”\nDismantling all the traps?\nHow could that be possible?\nThat would require complete knowledge of their locations and types…\n“!”\nThe leader realized.\nThe blueprints detailing the traps were only given to high-ranking officers.\nIf Woo-jin had obtained such information, it meant he was deeply involved with the organization.\n“Something…”\nWith unexpected and shocking results unfolding before his eyes, the leader felt a strong sense of foreboding.\nInitially, he had envisioned treating Woo-jin like a hamster trapped in a cage, driving and cornering him at Gray Star.\nThe sense of unease gradually became clearer.\nMaybe it was he who had been playing into the opponent’s hands all along.\nSuch an ominous feeling.\nHe already thought he had evaluated Woo-jin highly enough and remained cautious.\nEven that might have been an underestimation.\nThe leader’s face turned pale.\nHe urgently called the highest-ranking officer.\n“AQ…! Take care of the Disciplinary Committee Leader from Ahsung High.”\n– “Understood.”\nClick.\nThe leader hung up and threw the burner phone onto the desk.\nHis thoughts had changed.\nThe forces at Gray Star might not be able to defeat Woo-jin.\nIn that case, the only option left was to send AQ, Anomia’s strongest force.\nOnly then could Woo-jin be dealt with for sure.\n***\nGray Star.\nA building owned by Anomia through a trustee.\nDespite its dilapidated exterior, the interior was clean.\nThey had an anonymous wealthy sponsor behind them.\nThis building was also obtained through sponsorship.\nThe game never revealed who that sponsor was, but the community speculated it was one of the Six Sinners.\nWell, that’s a matter for later.\nRight now, the plan was to completely deal with the bothersome Anomia here.\nThe sponsor could be uncovered step by step afterward.\nThis place was the building where the protagonist, Lee Taesung, gathered his party to raid Anomia in the original game.\nIn other words, it was a location from the original story.\nThe original story is well-etched in my memory.\nBased on those memories, there were no problems avoiding the major traps.\nBoom!\nI threw my telescopic baton at the black turret that fired a mana bullet at me.\nBoom!With a loud explosion, teal electricity engulfed the turret, and its lights flickered out.\nI retrieved the baton and quickened my pace.\nOccasionally, hidden enemies sprang out to attack me, but I subdued them easily.\nIn the game, the boss was located on the upper floors of Gray Star.\nI recalled the place designed to be suitable for their battle.\nPark Minhyuk would likely be there too.\nThe elevator might be dangerous, so I quickly took the stairs.\nUpon reaching the upper floors, my view was filled with darkness.\nI could hear the irritating sound of multiple drones buzzing like flies.\nAs I entered, numerous drones lurking in the darkness buzzed to life, their red eyes glowing.\nAnd then.\nWhoosh!\nA powerful impact struck my head.\nI realized a large fist had punched me in the head.\nIt was a mana-enhanced strike.\nA punch likely delivered by someone of at least the 5th rank.\nThud! My body was hurled through the air, slamming hard into the wall.\nThe wall’s debris poured over me, covering my body.\nMaybe because it was designed for combat, the wall was sturdy.\nThe cushioning wasn’t too bad.\n“Ptui.”\nI spat out the dust that got into my mouth and lightly brushed off the debris covering my face.\nAs faint lights came on, illuminating the objects around, I saw various structures filling the space.\nIn the middle stood a hulking man, his fist surrounded by mana. He was wearing a Mayeon High School uniform.\nNearby, a petite girl in a hood crouched against a pillar, hugging her knees. Beneath her hooded coat, I glimpsed the black uniform of Ahsung High.\n“L-Leader….”\nIn front of another pillar.\nThe Disciplinary Committee Secretary, Park Minhyuk, was hanging limply.\nHe seemed to have taken more beatings, his injuries increased. He looked barely able to stand.\n“…”\nAs expected, I had grown attached to my Disciplinary Committee comrades.\nMy chest began to burn furiously.\n“Grrrr….”\nThe brute who had punched me growled like a beast.\nI knew him well.\nOne of the bosses of Gray Star.\nThe third-ranking officer in Anomia.\nA dropout from Mayeon High, Jang Ha-Moon.\n“Hello, Disciplinary Committee Leader.”\nThe hooded girl greeting me\ncasually was also familiar. She was another boss of Gray Star.\nThe second-ranking officer in Anomia.\nA dropout from our academy, Lee Ji-Soo.\nBoth were at the 5th rank.\nClick.\nCombat drones swirled around them, aiming their weapons at me.\nIt was just like the scene from the game.\nThey must have been preparing to show off like this.\nAnd it was indeed quite an impressive sight.\n“Sorry for the surprise attack. A 4th Tier wouldn’t have withstood that punch.”\nJi-Soo’s voice echoed through the space.\n“Even if it’s unfair, please understand. It was the leader’s order to take care of any intruders.\nOkay?”\nWhisk.\nI easily stood up, and Ji-Soo looked flustered.\nThere was no pain.\nIt just felt like being lightly tapped with a rubber hammer.\n“What the…? Why are you unharmed?”\nIgnoring Ji-Soo’s voice filled with bewilderment, I stood up, dusting off the dirt on my clothes.\n“My clothes got dirty.”\n“….”\nJi-Soo narrowed her eyes.\nHer once relaxed expression now brimming with caution.\nThe brute, Ha-Moon, who had thrown the punch, chuckled with a gruff voice, “Hehe, he stood up!”\nThat guy only knew how to make animal-like growls due to his intellectual disability.\nMeanwhile, MinHyuk, perhaps relieved to see I was okay, started crying again, bawling loudly.\n“Huaaah! Leader!! Please save me!!”\n“Shut up if you don’t want to get hit!”\n“Eep!”\nJi-Soo’s sharp voice startled Min-Hyuk into a whimpering silence.\nHe’s always like this.\nLast year, when he was captured by punks who had a grudge against the Disciplinary Committee.\nAs soon as I came to rescue him, he started bawling and yelling.\nI remember finding it so ridiculous that I ended up laughing.\nI turned my gaze to the enemies.\nI looked at them with naturally cold eyes.\n“I trust you understand the consequences of messing with the Disciplinary Committee.”\nI spoke calmly, adjusting the black gloves on my hands.\n“I hereby place you under arrest and will punish all offenders severely.”\nReciting the official declaration of the Disciplinary Committee in a solemn tone.\n“But.”\nCrackle!\nI activated the lightning mana in the telescopic baton once more.\n“You will face aggravated punishment.”\nI wouldn’t forgive them.",

      "content": "Chapter 20 – Rule 11. The Leader Eliminates the Villain Group (3)\n“Joined up. I leave the rest to you.”\nAhn Woo-jin spoke softly as he walked towards Lee Ji-Soo and Jang Ha-Moon, issuing the command through a wireless earphone.\n“Sigh.”\nLee Ji-Soo stood up with a sigh, her hands shoved into her pockets as she looked at Woo-jin.\n“I heard he’s strong for a 4th Tier… but in the end, he’s still a 4th Tier. He must heavily rely on elemental magic,” Ji-Soo remarked. “Unfortunately for you, your match-up with us is terrible. Lightning magic is useless in front of us.”\n“Ha-ha!”\nThe giant man, Jang Ha-Moon, tore out chunks of his hair and slurped them into his mouth like noodles.\nAs Ha-Moon swallowed the hair,\nZzt!\na translucent magnetic field made of magic quickly spread from him.\nHis unique ability, ‘Magnetokinesis.’\nMagic Formula Type 1: ‘Magnetic Field Deployment.’\nCrackle… The teal current flowing through the black truncheon dissipated instantly. Even Woo-jin’s wireless earphone was rendered useless.\nBoth the truncheon and the Lightning Rod started trembling, as if they were being pulled towards Ha-Moon. It was because of the magnetic force.\nIt was a situation Woo-jin had anticipated. He naturally secured his two weapons to his belt.\nHe had deliberately conducted lightning magic through the black truncheon to induce the magnetic field.\nThe power of Ha-Moon’s magnetic force greatly varied depending on the distance between himself and metallic objects. Luckily, Woo-jin was quite far from Ha-Moon, so he had no worry of losing the two weapons secured to his belt.\n“Turning hair into a magnetic field… Lightning magic is useless in front of me!” Ha-Moon laughed awkwardly.\nEating hair was the activation condition for his unique ability, Magnetokinesis.\nHe wouldn’t last long. Deploying such a strong magnetic field required a significant amount of magic power. It was a fact easy to understand, even without game knowledge.\n“Don’t mess with the functions. Just float it in the air.”\nJi-Soo pulled out her smartphone and let it float gently in the air.\nShe then showed her face to the phone’s camera.\n“Can you see me? Good. This is a special broadcast from Anomia~.”\nSuddenly, Ji-Soo waved her hand at the smartphone camera with a fake smile on her face.\n“?”\nWoo-jin looked at Ji-Soo, puzzled by the situation. It was something he had never seen in the game.\nJi-Soo pointed at Woo-jin with her thumb.\n“The Disciplinary Committee Leader of Ahsung High is standing right in front of us. Now, we’re going to utterly crush him. Huh? You call this rigged!? Does this look rigged to you, idiot? Keep your eyes open and watch. The fight is about to start.”\n“What are you doing?”\n“Can’t you see? It’s a broadcast.”\nJi-Soo answered bluntly with a grin.\n“A JTube live broadcast. This will be the proof that we defeated you. Our notoriety will grow, won’t it?”\nNotoriety has the power to attract people.\nAnomia is a villain group that rejects hypocrisy. Their goal is to spread their ideology by gaining notoriety. The more notorious they become, the more potential villain recruits they attract, along with sponsors and clients willing to provide funding.\nIn other words, the event of ‘subjugating Ahn Woo-jin, the Disciplinary Committee Leader of Ahsung High’ would serve as quality nourishment for Anomia’s rapid growth. The leader of Anomia had also endorsed this plan in advance.\n“So many attention-seekers…”\nWoo-jin scoffed, recalling the Sword Master of Sindorim.\n“Disciplinary Leader, why don’t you die honorably for us?”\nJi-Soo laughed brightly as she raised her right arm.\nWhirring. The drones targeting Woo-jin made mechanical sounds.\nThe air grew heavy.\n“…Fire.”\nWith a command from Ji-Soo, the drones all fired magic bullets at Woo-jin simultaneously. The battle had begun.\nBam! Woo-jin immediately kicked off the ground, carrying Park Min-Hyuk on his back, and hid behind a nearby pillar.\nThe drones continued their barrage on the pillar.\nSeveral drones that approached were pierced by Woo-jin’s thrown daggers and fell uselessly to the ground. These were special Anomia daggers, weapons Woo-jin had collected from enemies he had knocked out on the way up.\n‘Excellent accuracy.’\nTo Ji-Soo, Woo-jin seemed astonishingly experienced. Such skill couldn’t simply be achieved by enhancing the body with magic. It required extensive practice. She was curious about the true identity of this Disciplinary Committee Leader.\n“Ugh, aaah…”\nMeanwhile, behind the pillar, Min-Hyuk trembled with fear. He was terrible in combat.\n“Can you move?”\n“Huh? Y-Yes…! I secretly healed my legs while they were distracted…!”\nHowever, Minhyuk had a natural talent. He was born with healing magic as a healer, allowing him to cast healing spells on himself or others.\n“That’s good.”\nWoo-jin nodded. Despite the relentless barrage of magic bullets, Min-Hyuk asked,\n“But, Leader, what do we do now!? They’ve neutralized your lightning magic, and the match-up is too unfavorable…!”\n“We’ll win anyway.”\nWoo-jin declared.\n“Huh? How…?”\nMinhyuk knew Woo-jin was strong. However, he found it hard to understand Woo-jin’s confidence in defeating two Tier 5 opponents with such a disadvantageous match-up.\nClick.\nAs the drones reloaded their magic bullets, Woo-jin ordered,\n“Run.”\nWoo-jin and Min-Hyuk bolted from the pillar towards the emergency stairs.\n“Trying to escape the magnetic field?”\nJi-Soo smirked.\nOnce deployed, Ha-Moon’s magnetic field’s location and range were fixed. It was easy information to discern if one paid attention.\nSeeing them risk distancing themselves, Ji-Soo guessed they had figured out the limitations of the magnetic field.\nThere wasn’t much of a ‘limitation.’ Ha-Moon could simply close the distance and redeploy the magnetic field.\nThe problem was that deploying the magnetic field consumed a lot of magic power. It couldn’t be used recklessly.\n“Stop the drone fire.”\nJi-Soo tapped Ha-Moon’s arm.\nContinuing the drone fire would prevent Ha-Moon from approaching the enemies. So, Ji-Soo chose a different method.\n“Float these scraps.”\nJi-Soo gestured with her chin and instructed.\n“Got it…!”\nDue to the daggers thrown by Woo-jin, four broken drones floated in the air at Ha-Moon’s gesture, controlled by the powerful magnetic field directed by his will.\n“Hyaa.”\nWith a quick lick, Ji-Soo touched the floating drones with her tongue. The saliva darkened rapidly, spreading like a virus and seeping into the internal mechanisms of the drones. Ji-Soo channeled fire magic through her fingers to the spots covered with her saliva. Whoosh! Flames ignited.\n“Throw them.”\n“Hup!”\nHa-Moon swung his arm, hurling the four saliva-covered drones at Woo-jin and Min-Hyuk with the force of the magnetic field. The accuracy was off, but Ji-Soo didn’t care much.\nWhoosh! Woo-jin swiftly shielded Min-Hyuk and hid behind a structure. The drones exploded in mid-air.\nBoom!!\nThe powerful blast, containing a shockwave, spread out with no escape. The force was far greater than that of a magic grenade. If hit directly, even Woo-jin, with his body maximally strengthened by magic, would have suffered severe burns.\nTurning saliva into explosives.\nThe unique ability, ‘Flame Cannon Tongue.’\nMagic Formula Type 1: ‘Explosive Liquid.’\nThe explosion’s power varied based on the amount of magic Ji-Soo concentrated into her saliva and the material used for the explosion. Normally, one couldn’t imbue saliva with magic, but Ji-Soo could due to her unique ability.\nThe limitation of her ability was that she couldn’t create and store explosives separately. The magic imbued in her saliva would dissipate within a minute, forcing her to create the explosives on the spot.\nWhoosh!\nCrack!\nFlames and metal fragments from the drones scattered like bullets, fiercely striking the structure.\nWoo-jin and Min-Hyuk remained safe behind the structure.\n“Tsk.”\nJi-Soo clicked her tongue, sensing something was off.\n‘Is his reflexes that good? No, it’s more like… he knows our abilities.’\nEven though it was their first fight, Woo-jin was handling things expertly, as if he had fought Ji-Soo and Ha-Moon several times before.\n‘Could our information have leaked?’\nIt was likely. Woo-jin had already thwarted Anomia’s plans before. But it didn’t matter much. Ji-Soo decided to taunt him.\n“Hey, aren’t you ashamed to keep running away like a coward, Disciplinary Leader? Fight us, you weakling! Only then can we have some fun!”\nJi-Soo laughed and repeated the process from earlier.\nBoom!\nAnother two drones flew and exploded where Woo-jin and Min-Hyuk were. But they had moved to another structure to avoid the blast.\nZzt…. The magnetic field began to flicker. It was a sign it would disappear soon.\n“Huh, huh…”\nThe giant man, Ha-Moon, charged at Woo-jin and Min-Hyuk hiding behind the structure. He tore out more chunks of hair and slurped them like noodles.\nZzt! The old magnetic field faded as a new one was deployed. No matter how much Woo-jin and Min-Hyuk ran, Ha-Moon could just eat more hair and redeploy the magnetic field, making it impossible to escape.\n“I just need to take your weapons…!”\nHa-Moon’s goal was to close the distance and pull Woo-jin’s weapons with his strong magnetic force.\nNo matter how hard Woo-jin tried to keep his equipment, if the weapons were pulled strongly enough, he would follow. Then, it would be a close-quarters fight.\nAt that moment,\nSsshhh!!\nThe repeated explosions triggered the sprinklers, spraying water vigorously. Woo-jin and Min-Hyuk were soaked.\nThe water didn’t reach Ji-Soo’s location.\n“…”\nWater started to pool on the floor. While this posed a risk if lightning magic was used, the pervasive magnetic field nullified that concern, as long as Ha-Moon didn’t disrupt the magnetic field.\n“Hmm?”\nHa-Moon was surprised.\nWoo-jin, now soaked, emerged from the structure gripping his black truncheon and Lightning Rod. He faced the charging Ha-Moon.\n“Haha!”\nA smile spread across Ha-Moon’s face.",

      "content": "Chapter 20 (Continued)\nHad Woo-jin chosen a frontal assault after all? It made sense; there were no other options.\nBehind Woo-jin, Min-Hyuk was running away. The healer had served as a decoy and was now irrelevant. As Min-Hyuk headed towards the emergency stairs, Ha-Moon ignored him.\nHis focus was solely on Ahn Woo-jin.\nThe thought of fighting Ahsung High’s Disciplinary Committee Leader ignited Ha-Moon’s fervor.\n“Hm?”\nJi-Soo sensed something was off.\nShe turned around, feeling an unnatural, faint sound, like a hallucination.\nShe saw nothing but a solid wall behind her. Was it just her imagination?\n“!?”\nHa-Moon suddenly widened his eyes.\n“This sound…!?”\nHa-Moon swiftly halted his steps on the water-soaked floor. He could hear a sound coming from beyond the wall. With his heightened senses, he instantly recognized the nature of the sound. It was growing clearer and sharper—a piercing sound.\n“Ji-Soo!!”\n“Huh?”\nHa-Moon turned around and dashed towards Ji-Soo at full speed. Just as he embraced her and turned his back,\nBOOM!!\nA massive arrow, imbued with wind magic, crashed through the wall of Gray Star and penetrated the interior. It exploded shortly after.\n***\nA few minutes earlier.\nDoha, the treasurer of Ahsung High’s Disciplinary Committee, decided to follow the leader’s command. Her mission was to provide support fire. Woo-jin had precisely instructed her on the target location based on his game knowledge.\n“As ordered.”\nOn a hill, Doha firmly planted the end of her large bow into the ground. She secured an arrow much larger than typical ones, nearly as long as her height. Then, she placed her foot on the central foothold of the bow, extended her legs, and drew the string back with both hands. Her body, as flexible as a cat, stretched gracefully. With her body strengthened by magic, there was no strain from the tension.\nAs she activated her unique ability, strange patterns appeared in her eyes.\nThe unique ability, ‘Laplace’s Demon.’\nMagic Formula Type 1: ‘Precision Equation.’\nThis ability allowed her to automatically calculate the positions and momenta of everything in her field of view like a computer. While she couldn’t discern minute details, the conditions for successful support fire were adequately met. Thanks to the passive effect of her ability, ‘Enhanced Vision,’ everything she saw was crystal clear, even buildings in the distance.\nAs a side effect of using her ability, she would suffer from severe dry eye and mental dullness for a day, but helping the leader took precedence.\nWhoosh!\nWind magic enveloped the arrow, causing its color to become more vibrant. The arrow was a kind of explosive similar to a magic grenade, a resource of the Disciplinary Committee.\nDoha aimed at a high-rise building on the outskirts of Academy City. She took a deep breath, held it, and minimized her movements. She analyzed the falling raindrops, the movement of dark clouds, the wind direction and speed, and the violent dance of nearby leaves.\n“…”\nA perfect moment arrived.\nDoha released the string.\nWhoosh!!!\nThe wind magic spread like a gale. The arrow pierced through the rain, streaking across the sky in a straight line, following the desired trajectory. The wind magic around the arrow repelled the rain, adding to its propulsion. It shone like a silver comet.\nThe arrow reached the upper floors of the Gray Star building.\nBOOM!!\nIt destroyed the wall, reached Ji-Soo and Ha-Moon, and finally exploded.\n“Ugh!”\nThe unexpected explosion sent Ji-Soo and Ha-Moon flying towards Woo-jin. Ha-Moon’s control over his magic wavered, causing the magnetic field to dissipate. The drones caught in the blast malfunctioned and crashed to the ground.\nJi-Soo and Ha-Moon rolled across the floor and quickly regained their stances. The explosive’s power, akin to a magic grenade, wasn’t enough to severely injure them as Tier 5s.\nBut it was enough.\n“!”\nSplat.\nJi-Soo shuddered as her hand touched the floor. The spot where she landed was directly beneath a sprinkler, still spraying water vigorously. The floor was flooded. She shouted,\n“Hey! Use your ability quickly—!”\nIt was too late.\nZAP!!\n“Ahhh!!”\n“Ugh!!”\nThe wave of teal electricity surged through the impure water, striking Ji-Soo and Ha-Moon. Woo-jin had directed lightning magic through his truncheon, channeling it into the water.\nJi-Soo and Ha-Moon twitched violently, steam rising from their bodies. They nearly lost consciousness. Their brains felt fried, and tinnitus rang in their ears, but they endured. There was still a chance to counterattack. If they deployed the magnetic field now, they could corner Woo-jin. But Woo-jin wouldn’t let the opportunity slip.\nBAM!\nWoo-jin channeled magic into his legs and launched himself forward. Ji-Soo glared at Woo-jin with bloodshot eyes as he charged at her. She needed to dodge, but her body wouldn’t respond. At his current speed, she couldn’t avoid him.\nThwack!\nThe black truncheon struck Ha-Moon in the mouth, and the Lightning Rod pressed against Ji-Soo’s throat.\n“Guh!”\n“Ugh!”\nThud!\nWoo-jin knocked them both to the ground and looked down at them. His icy blue-green eyes glowed ominously.\nAs her airway was constricted and her breath shortened, Ji-Soo felt intense fear. Woo-jin’s stern face showed no hint of mercy. Despite this, she pleaded,\n“Spare…”\nZAP!!!\n“Ahhh!!!!”\n“Mmmph!!!”\nThe lightning magic from the two batons surged fiercely, electrocuting them without mercy. Their screams tore through the air.\nEventually, Woo-jin stopped discharging magic.\n“…”\nJi-Soo and Ha-Moon had passed out. Their faces contorted in agony, they lay there, exhaling steam, covered in tears, mucus, and drool.\n“Pathetic.”\nWoo-jin rose, holding his two batons, and picked up the smartphone that had fallen. It was Ji-Soo’s. The broadcast was still live.\nWoo-jin’s wet face appeared on the screen. The viewer count had soared to about 40,000. The viewers were in shock at Woo-jin’s appearance. The live chat was in chaos.\n[OMG]\n[Is this real?]\n[Leader???]\n[Wow, it’s real!]\n[Anomia got wrecked?]\n[Are you safe??]\n[What happened?]\n[Is this legit? What’s going on?]\n[No way, a Tier 4 took down two Tier 5s??]\n[Wow….]\nThe chat messages were coming in so fast, it was hard to keep up. But it was clear that half the viewers took the situation seriously, while the other half didn’t.\n‘This is crazy….’\nWoo-jin silently ended the broadcast.\nTalking off the top of his head now would be less effective than discussing with Baek-Seo and making an official announcement later.\n─ Leader!?\nSuddenly, Ha Yesong’s lively voice echoed through Woo-jin’s earphone. It had started working again.\n─ Wow, the connection is back! Leader, are you alive? If you’re dead, please respond!\n“The situation is handled.”\n─ Thank goodness you’re alive! Hehe. I just saw the broadcast…! I’m glad you’re safe! I was a bit worried.\n“Are you on your way?”\n─ Yes, we’re gathering the Disciplinary Committee and heading your way! Please wait a bit longer! Loyalty!\nHa Yesong’s task was to mobilize the Disciplinary Committee as soon as Woo-jin and Min-Hyuk reunited.\nWoo-jin approached the shattered outer wall, braving the wind and rain, and looked outside.\nFour multipurpose transport vehicles of the Disciplinary Committee were racing towards Gray Star.\n─ Situation here is also resolved.\nA refined voice followed. It was Vice Leader Oh Baek-Seo’s voice.\nHer task was to subdue Anomia’s strongest force, AQ, and the group’s leader. If that was done, Anomia was essentially annihilated.\n─ Leader.\n“Yeah.”\n─ …I’ll see you soon.\nIt was a meaningful statement, tinged with the sound of her breath.\n“?”\nWhat was that? ‘I’ll join you’ or ‘I’ll see you soon.’ Although it seemed to mean the same thing, Baek-Seo’s words were laden with emotion, like concern, relief, and perhaps affection….\nNo, interpreting it as affection was overthinking. Woo-jin dismissed the thought.\n“…”\nHe took a deep breath.\nHandling the aftermath would take the rest of the night.",

      "content": "Chapter 21 – Rule 11. The Leader Eliminates the Villain Group (4)\nA few minutes earlier.\nPark Minhyuk had been rescued. Now, Oh Baek-seo only needed to complete her mission.\nBaek-seo stood still, looking up at the sky, holding the umbrella Woo-jin had given her. She absentmindedly tapped the umbrella handle with her fingers.\n“……”\nWoo-jin had instructed the officers to follow his orders without asking questions.\nBaek-seo was tasked with subduing Anomia’s top executive and the organization’s leader, though she had no idea how Woo-jin had discovered their locations. She would ask him later. For now, she just followed his instructions.\nIt wasn’t just out of loyalty. Baek-seo knew how to separate personal feelings from professional duties.\nWoo-jin was someone worth following. That was the only reason. Nothing more.\nStill, she was worried about him.\nAnomia was a notorious villain group, even employing exceptionally talented dropouts as executives.\nIt was easy to predict that Woo-jin would soon face dangerous foes. Now that Woo-jin and Minhyuk had joined forces, Baek-seo wanted to finish her mission quickly and meet up with Woo-jin.\nShe felt at ease when he was by her side.\nClick-clack.\nSuddenly, a man in a trench coat appeared on her path. He stopped and glared at her.\n“Oh. You’re here?”\nSeeing him, Baek-seo asked in a polite tone.\nIt was easy to guess that this man was ‘AQ,’ the top executive of Anomia that Woo-jin had mentioned.\nThe magical energy emanating from him was comparable to that of the Mayeon High School Disciplinary Committee Leader.\n“Disciplinary Committee… How did you know we were here?”\nAQ asked aggressively.\n“We just follow the Leader’s orders.”\nBaek-seo replied in her usual gentle tone, though her eyes did not smile at all.\nToday had been a bad day.\nA fellow committee member had been abducted and mistreated, and Woo-jin had been lured away. It seemed the Disciplinary Committee had been underestimated.\nEven the time spent walking under the umbrella with Woo-jin had been cut short because of them. She couldn’t even express her regret now.\nAt least her anger had a clear target.\n“I see…”\nAQ narrowed his eyes and chuckled.\nHe didn’t bother to ask how Baek-seo had arrived here. He was already well aware of the Ahsung High Disciplinary Committee Leader’s reputation.\nWoo-jin’s intelligence capabilities were beyond impressive. Even AQ, who pursued only combat, felt a pure respect for Woo-jin’s abilities.\nIt was clear Woo-jin had already grasped critical information about Anomia. There was no need to question how Baek-seo knew the leader’s location and was waiting here.\nIt was all Woo-jin’s doing.\n“Oh Baek-seo. I’ve wanted to face you.”\nAQ extended both arms.\nSring! A long blade hidden in his sleeves shot out. The sharp blade gleamed with raindrops.\n“You, hailed as a prodigy in Neo Seoul…!”\nAQ was a man who pursued combat. He called himself a demon.\nHe was Anomia’s greatest asset. A prominent figure in Neo Seoul.\nUndefeated in countless battles. He had no reason to fear even the 6th Tier Oh Baek-seo.\nHe would easily overcome her.\nWhoosh!\nWind elemental magic wrapped around AQ’s blade.\n“Come at me, Oh Baek-seo! I’ll prove that I, the demon of Neo Seoul, am stronger than you…!”\nTen seconds later.\n“Ugh…”\nThe self-proclaimed demon lay wounded on the ground.\nAll he could do was let out a pitiful groan. Even that was a struggle.\nBaek-seo, holding a sword, threw a restraining magic device. Thud! Several sturdy belts sprang from the device and bound AQ.\nBaek-seo then walked towards the high-rise building AQ had come from.\nAs she entered the lobby, battle drones, turrets, and Anomia’s elite soldiers confronted her. They all took combat stances.\nHowever, when a beautiful mix of blue and purple magical energy flowed like a butterfly’s wings, all the combat robots were sliced in half, and Anomia’s soldiers fell, screaming.\nIt wasn’t elemental magic. Nor was it a unique ability.\nWith just basic abilities of ‘physical enhancement’ and ‘equipment enhancement’ available to 3rd Tier individuals, Baek-seo had cleared the battlefield with her swift swordsmanship.\n“Oh Baek-seo…!”\nAt the top floor office, near a secret passage.\nAnomia’s leader, who had been hiding, launched a surprise attack. However, Baek-seo easily deflected it and subdued him with her sword’s sheath.\nThud! Thwack!\n“Ugh!”\nIt wasn’t even a contest.\n“How did you… How did you know I was here…?”\nThe leader asked with a frightened expression.\nBaek-seo shrugged.\n“Our Leader is quite capable. He had prepared for everything.”\nThere’s always someone better. If you don’t look up, you won’t even realize they exist.\nThe leader gritted his teeth and trembled before finally giving up.\nHe had been too arrogant.\nHadn’t it become increasingly clear that Disciplinary Committee Leader Ahn Woo-jin was not someone to be messed with?\nEven this genius in front of him bowed to Woo-jin.\nKnowing that Woo-jin had seen through all his plans and was poised to destroy his organization made him anxious.\nHe had foolishly thought he could defeat Woo-jin.\nThat was his downfall.\nThere would be no second chances.\nThunk!\n“Ugh!”\nBaek-seo struck the leader with her sword’s sheath, knocking him unconscious. She then spoke into her earpiece.\n“Situation resolved here too. Leader, …I’ll come to see you soon.”\nThe mission Baek-seo had undertaken was the most challenging, but it was not difficult for her.\nAfterward, Oh Baek-seo left the scene to the 2nd and 3rd squads and headed for the Gray Star.\nWhen she finally met Woo-jin, Baek-seo didn’t show much reaction. However, she did not leave Woo-jin’s side as he directed the scene until late at night.\n***\nSeveral days passed in a blur as they dealt with the aftermath of the incident.\n[ Ahsung High Disciplinary Committee Leader Captures Anomia Leader and Executives… ‘Great Feat’ ]\n[ 4th Tier Defeats Two 5th Tier Criminals Alone… Who Is He? ]\n[ Ahsung High Disciplinary Committee Leader Annihilates Anomia Early in His Term… ]\nNews of Anomia’s capture spread rapidly across the internet.\nHowever.\n‘Why is the focus on me instead of the Disciplinary Committee…?’\nInternet news concentrated on the ‘Disciplinary Committee Leader’ rather than the ‘Disciplinary Committee’ of Ahsung High.\nIt was expected, due to Lee Ji-Soo’s JTube broadcast.\nFrom the viewers’ perspective, this incident was more sensational than when the Sindo-rim Swordmaster challenged for a duel.\n‘I didn’t expect it to turn out like this…’\nSince Lee Ji-Soo never live-streamed her gameplay, this development was unexpected.\nHe clutched his throbbing head. This was troublesome.\n‘Neo Seoul has plenty of challengers looking for strong opponents… This could make me a target for the Six Sinners…’\nWhat to do…\nIt was manageable with the Sindo-rim Swordmaster. He was a 4th Tier, so a duel between two 4th Tiers was just a minor event.\nBut this time, it was different. A 4th Tier had defeated two notorious 5th Tiers.\nAfter dealing with Anomia, more significant threats could emerge.\nThe worst-case scenario was becoming a target for the Six Sinners.\nEspecially Goliath, whose intentions were impossible to read. If he came now, it would be the end. He sought strength. Woo-jin couldn’t afford to be seen as prey.\nIt was better for the achievements to focus on the ‘Disciplinary Committee.’\nArticles like ‘How did a 4th Tier defeat two 5th Tiers?’ and ‘What potential does the Ahsung High Disciplinary Committee Leader have?’ needed to be minimized.\n‘The press conference didn’t help…’\nThe incident became so famous that the Disciplinary Committee had to explain the situation at a press conference.\nLee Ji-Soo’s JTube broadcast and the sweeping of Anomia had garnered significant attention. The details were left vague, citing an ongoing investigation.\nNaturally, reporters asked about him defeating two 5th Tiers, but Woo-jin credited Yoo Doha’s contributions.\nHowever, online articles still heavily emphasized his accomplishments. The public could see Lee Ji-Soo’s broadcast for themselves, which played a big role.\nPeople believe what they want to believe.\n‘Please, let it just pass…’",

      "content": "Chapter 21 (Continued)\nHe hoped the eccentric challengers and the Six Sinners would leave him alone. It was frightening…\n‘Anyway, Anomia is definitely finished now.’\nIn the Disciplinary Committee’s office, he straightened his posture and read the report on the Anomia case.\nAnomia would be destroyed now. With both the leader and potential successors captured, the organization couldn’t survive. It was already over.\nIn the game, Anomia weakened after being defeated by the main characters and eventually collapsed for unknown reasons, much like the Mafia Do-hwa Group that Lee Se-Ah belonged to.\nWhether it was internal conflict due to weakened strength or being swallowed by another villain group…\n‘Now that it’s here, it’s curious. Why did they collapse in the game?’\nHe was curious about the reasons behind Anomia’s fall and Lee Se-Ah’s fate.\nThe game never revealed the exact reasons, and he couldn’t know now.\nUnless the Six Sinners were involved, there was no reason for him to care.\nThe problem was.\n‘If the Six Sinners were involved…’\nIf their collapse was linked to the Six Sinners?\nThere was a potential link—a sponsor who provided substantial support to Anomia.\nThe community speculated it was one of the Six Sinners. Investigating this case might uncover clues about them.\nTracking the Six Sinners was crucial.\nIt was better to ambush them than to respond to their incidents.\n‘Why do I feel uneasy…’\nPerhaps it was because of his game knowledge. He felt an ominous premonition of a major event.\nHe didn’t want to think about it.\n‘It’s not time to make a judgment yet anyway.’\nIt was an issue to consider after identifying the sponsors. He could only hope his premonition was baseless.\n‘Also…’\nHe looked over to the table.\nPark Minhyuk was there, typing furiously on his laptop, working on the press release for the Anomia incident, the report sent to the police academy, the event summary, the case files, and more.\nHe remembered handling the scene at Gray Star.\nMinhyuk had shed tears, expressing countless thanks. When Woo-jin had simply said, “Good job,” and patted his shoulder, Minhyuk’s eyes had sparkled.\nSince then, he had been working tirelessly.\nMinhyuk had memories of being beaten by a gang. Woo-jin worried that this incident might have traumatized him, but Minhyuk didn’t seem to be suffering from any trauma.\nInstead, there was a different problem.\n“Minhyuk, take it easy. You’ll collapse at this rate.”\nHa Yesong, who was sitting opposite Minhyuk, spoke cautiously. She seemed to have decided to speak after some hesitation.\nMinhyuk shook his head firmly.\n“This is the only way I can repay the Leader, who is like the sky.”\n“The sky… Well, working diligently is better than being in the trash can like usual…”\nYesong turned her eyes to Woo-jin, seemingly unable to bear Minhyuk’s praises any longer.\nShe looked at him as if to ask, ‘Is it okay to let him be like this?’\nWoo-jin answered with a nod.\nIt felt uncomfortable being praised, but it was better to let it be. Having members deeply loyal to him was a good thing.\nYesong sighed and left the office early.\n***\nBy evening, the sky was beautifully decorated with a sunset. The rainy season had ended.\nSipping green tea, I read through the incident report. It was unrelated to the Anomia incident.\n‘I need to prepare for midterms soon.’\nThe Disciplinary Committee takes on the role of proctors during exams or major practical evaluations. This is due to the severe shortage of available teachers who can act as supervisors. The review of proctors was already completed, and preparations were in their final stages.\nHowever, aside from that, I also needed to study for my own midterms. Although I had expected to be busy, I hadn’t anticipated this level of workload. Thankfully, I had done thorough preparation during the vacation.\n“Leader.”\nFrom across the table, Baek-seo called out to me.\n“Want to eat this while you work? I brought some snacks.”\nBaek-seo held a case with a picture of cookies on it.\nSnacks. A short break sounded good.\n“Sure.”\nAs I sat opposite Baek-seo, I noticed the black tea in front of me.\n“You made tea?”\n“I thought you might want some with the cookies. So I prepared it.”\nBaek-seo replied in her refined tone.\nMy vice leader knows me too well. It feels like having a girlfriend of over five years by my side. Not that I know exactly what that feels like, but it could be compared to that.\n“Thanks for the food.”\nI opened the case and picked up a cookie.\nIt was a simple, sweet cookie. Delicious, though.\n“Did you check your email?”\nBaek-seo brought up a topic.\n“Email? Not yet.”\n“They said you’re getting a reward for capturing Anomia. ‘Platinum Mileage,’ to be exact.”\n“……!”\nWow. Awesome.\nI hadn’t paid attention due to being buried in work.\nMileage points. An award given for outstanding achievements that raise the academy’s name.\nThe academy recommends to the Federal Council, which then decides whether the person deserves the mileage. Alternatively, the Federal Council can directly assign it.\nMileage comes in Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum.\nPlatinum is the highest tier. It’s awarded for significant contributions that benefit the entire Academy City.\nWith Platinum Mileage, you can use Platinum shops or have a weapon forged by a Platinum-tier blacksmith.\n“Nice.”\nI replied calmly, trying to suppress my rising excitement.\n‘Awesome.’\nI already knew what I would do with the Platinum Mileage.\n‘Weapon forging! I can finally get my own weapon…!’\nI clenched my fist and did a dance of joy inwardly.\nI was overwhelmed with emotion.\nEvery man dreams of having his own special weapon. Since realizing I had been reincarnated in this world, that dream was a given.\nThe weapon I usually used, a baton, was just standard issue. So I wanted a new weapon of the same type. I was already used to the baton, and it was excellent for suppression.\nTo have it forged by a Platinum-tier blacksmith…! I felt like dancing a moonwalk right in front of Baek-seo and cheering out the window.\n“You seem happy?”\n“…Not bad. It’s Platinum Mileage, after all.”\nBaek-seo smiled knowingly, probing my feelings.\nNo matter how happy I was, I couldn’t let it harm my image. Thankfully, I maintained my composure as I chewed on the cookie.\n“Leader.”\n“What?”\n“I want a reward too. As a token of recognition, can’t you give me one?”\n“…Me?”\nBaek-seo nodded.\nIt was an unexpected request. A reward, out of the blue?\n“I think I deserve a reward too.”\n“Well…, I think so too. Then, um….”\nA reward, huh.\nIf it weren’t for Baek-seo, we wouldn’t have been able to completely eradicate Anomia. It was only right to give her something for her efforts.\nSplitting the Platinum Mileage… was impossible.\nThe system was designed to prevent abuse, so transferring the mileage to someone else was prohibited. Similar acts were also illegal.\n‘What kind of reward…?’\nA reward that made sense…\nNothing came to mind.\nI couldn’t give her my most valuable possession, the Lightning Rod.\nAs I was pondering, Baek-seo suddenly leaned over and took my right arm.\nShe gently placed my hand on her head and moved it back and forth, having me pat her head.\n“?”\nWhat was she doing…?\nBaek-seo closed her eyes, enjoying my touch.\nShe then let go of my arm. Following her lead, I continued to stroke her soft hair.\nA quiet sense of embarrassment washed over me. My mind was confused.\n“Baek-seo?”\n“Don’t overthink it. This is enough.”\nBaek-seo opened her eyes slightly and looked at me gently.\n“I didn’t expect this.”\n“Sometimes, I just want to be spoiled. I’m your subordinate, after all. Getting patted by my superior feels good.”\nIsn’t she embarrassed saying that herself?\n“……”\nI couldn’t ask that.\nBaek-seo’s face, illuminated by the sunset, was slightly flushed. She seemed to feel good but also a bit embarrassed.\n‘She’s really cute….’\nI always felt why Baek-seo was called a goddess, but this moment was the most intense.\nShe’s truly beautiful. And quite adorable too.\nBefore I knew it, I started enjoying patting Baek-seo’s head. It felt like petting a cute puppy. I felt a sense of satisfaction.\n“……”\n“……”\nWhile spending time quietly, I realized something.\nLogically, this situation was very embarrassing, wasn’t it…?\n“Should we stop now?”\nBaek-seo asked with a gentle smile.\nDespite the embarrassment, my head shook side to side on its own.\n“Can I keep doing it…?”\n“?”\nBaek-seo blinked her big eyes at me.\nThough embarrassed, I didn’t want to just let it pass.\nI was always grateful to Baek-seo. If she could be satisfied just by me patting her head, I’d continue to do it. I could handle the pounding heart and embarrassment.\nAfter a moment of hesitation, Baek-seo smiled and said.\n“…Sure.”\nShe leaned closer to me. Her beautiful face coming nearer startled me, but I continued to pat her head. She enjoyed my touch like a puppy.\nThough it was usually hard to read Baek-seo’s emotions, today, her feelings seemed to be conveyed.\nIf Baek-seo had a tail, it would probably be wagging up and down.\nThat was the thought that came to mind.\n‘Cute.’\nI felt content with just the thought.",

      "content": "Chapter 22 – Rule 12. The Leader Receives Top Marks (1)\nThe day the Anomia incident was reported.\n“Wow…”\nLee Se-Ah, naked, let out a gasp of admiration while soaking in the bathtub and watching the TV mounted on the wall.\nShe had already received information about Anomia’s capture before the news broke. Yet, no matter how many times she heard about Anomia’s capture, the news still amazed her.\n“Unbelievable…”\nAhn Woo-jin. This man was truly extraordinary.\nFrom the beginning of his term as the Disciplinary Committee Leader, he had utterly destroyed Anomia, a notorious villain group that had been a thorn in the side of several academies, including Hanyang Federal Academy. The word ‘amazing’ was not enough to describe his feat.\nThis event significantly elevated the status of the Ahsung High Disciplinary Committee in Academy City.\nIt wasn’t because of Oh Baek-seo, a 6th Tier girl hailed as a genius. It was due to the remarkable efforts of Ahn Woo-jin, a 4th Tier boy.\n“I owe him big time.”\n─ Yes, thanks to him, things will proceed smoothly.\nThe voice of Lee Jung-mi came from the communication device on the table beside Se-Ah.\n“I really like him. We need to express our gratitude, don’t we?”\nAnomia had been a significant problem for the Do-hwa Group mafia as well.\nWith the most troublesome obstacle gone thanks to Woo-jin, it was only right to express their gratitude multiple times over.\nThe organization owed Woo-jin twice now. Se-Ah had no intention of ignoring this debt.\n─ Should we prepare monetary compensation? Or perhaps a rare magic tool? Maybe even an artifact? Thanks to him, it’s only a matter of time before we generate significant profits.\n“No, giving such things to the Disciplinary Committee Leader would be considered a bribe…. It would cause trouble.”\n─ It depends on how it’s given, doesn’t it?\n“Oh, that senior wouldn’t like that. He has a very strong sense of legality.”\nSe-Ah twisted her long, wet black hair as she spoke.\n“Then, how about this?”\nSe-Ah’s slitted eyes curved into a fox-like smile.\n—\nCandidates for Platinum Mileage are limited to a maximum of five each semester.\nTwo are awarded after midterms, and three after finals. They are awarded on specific days and can sometimes be fewer or none at all.\nRegardless, I would receive my Platinum Mileage after midterms.\nBut for now, I had no time to think about mileage.\nI recalled earlier today, while eating a sandwich Baek-seo had made for me on a bench behind a deserted building. Through an open window, I overheard a conversation between some girls.\n“This new Disciplinary Committee Leader is something else.”\nI unconsciously held my breath and listened intently to their conversation.\nEavesdropping isn’t good, but since the conversation was about my reputation, I couldn’t help but listen.\n“I was skeptical about the subway incident, but after hearing he took down Anomia too… I’ve gained a new respect.”\n“I agree. He’s really skilled.”\nI nodded. They had good judgment.\n“Still, it’s a bit disappointing that Baek-seo isn’t the leader.”\nWhat?\n“It would have been the best if Baek-seo was leading the Disciplinary Committee.”\n“The current leader is fine, right? Sure, Oh Baek-seo is a 6th Tier genius….”\n“You just don’t know Baek-seo well. I swear, no one at our school can match her. It feels like she lives in a completely different world. Seeing her made me wonder how someone can be so perfect.”\n“Is she really that amazing?”\n“She is, you fool. Honestly, the achievements of the current Disciplinary Committee Leader, if Baek-seo were the leader, they would be even greater, not less.”\n‘These kids…’\nEven Baek-seo doesn’t know about the game knowledge I possess.\nIntellectual superiority. That’s the power I have.\nAlthough Baek-seo is superior to me in every way, without my game knowledge, Anomia wouldn’t have been captured.\n…Of course, I couldn’t argue that point. I couldn’t talk about my game knowledge.\nFrom their perspective, it’s natural to have such opinions. Oh Baek-seo is indeed extraordinary.\n“Moreover, Baek-seo has always been number one academically. The current leader isn’t a slouch, but there’s nothing where he surpasses Baek-seo…. I might be biased because I know Baek-seo, but I feel a bit disappointed. I think things would have been even better with her as the leader.”\nGrades, huh….\nMidterms were approaching.\nI had no intention of spending the exam period dazed and overshadowed by Baek-seo again.\nAnd now.\nI was reading a textbook in the Disciplinary Committee’s office.\n‘Aaaaah…!’\nInternally, I was fiercely studying.\nThere was a lot to cover: Korean, English, Math, Social Studies… Not to mention practical subjects like Magical Practice and Combat.\nDue to the overwhelming workload from the Disciplinary Committee, my study time had been severely lacking. If I hadn’t done thorough preparation during the vacation, I couldn’t imagine how it would have been.\nAs the leader of the Disciplinary Committee, ranked number one in combat power among about 400 students, achieving top grades was essential to maintain my dignity.\nIn any situation, I had to set an example.\nMoreover, this was the only way I could surpass Baek-seo.\nI needed to excel in at least one thing more than her.\nBeing a leader without any advantage over the vice leader would be humiliating.\nHowever, with the other members present in the office, I couldn’t study like a dog devouring its food. I had to maintain my image, so I read the textbook calmly, pretending to be at peace, while internally, a storm raged.\n“Ha Yesong, enters like the wind!”\nHa Yesong abruptly opened the door to the Disciplinary Committee office and walked in.\n“Welcome.”\n“Hello.”\n“Hi.”\nWithout looking up from my textbook, I greeted her. The vice leader, Oh Baek-seo, who was tidying up the pantry, also greeted her.\nYoo Doha, the treasurer, was lying on the sofa with a book over her face, showing no reaction as she was deeply asleep.\nPark Minhyuk, the secretary, sitting opposite Yoo Doha, typed on his laptop while greeting her.\n“Wow, Leader! Are you studying?”\nWith eyes like a rabbit spotting prey, Yesong approached my desk.\n“Midterms are coming up. Just skimming through the textbook.”\nI replied nonchalantly, emphasizing my calm demeanor.\n“As expected of the second-ranked student!”\n“……”\nIt hurt. It felt like a dagger to the heart.\n“Of course, it’s only natural. Our Leader’s intellect is unrivaled.”\n“Ugh, there’s that praise again….”\nAs Minhyuk interjected, Yesong glared at him.\n“But Yesong, aren’t you studying?”\nYou were talking about me being relaxed.\n“No, not yet. I review regularly, so I’m fine!”\nYesong answered confidently.\n“So, what are you doing these days?”\n“I usually spend this time visiting the restaurants I’ve wanted to try.”\nYesong placed her hands together on her chest as she answered.\n“So, you’re not studying.”\nIn summary, that’s what she was saying.\n“Leader, playing during exam periods is the most fun!”\n“Well, that’s true….”\nThat was… a fair point.",

It was a privilege of life that could only be enjoyed during exam periods.\n“Hehe.”\nYesong had chosen to live ‘happily’ rather than endure the pain of exams. That was one way to enjoy youth, wasn’t it?\n‘Carefree…’\nIt made me a bit envious. Here I was, tirelessly working to prevent a dystopian future…\nBut there was nothing I could say. Despite appearances, Yesong’s grades were good enough to not tarnish the image of the Disciplinary Committee members.\nIn reality, she was genuinely diligent in her studies, hidden behind that carefree smile. I wished she would put that effort into work as well.\n“Leader, here.”\n“Thanks.”\nI took a sip of the warm coffee Baek-seo had brought.\nCaffeine, the essential buff during exam periods.\nI had already had an energy drink, but sleep was a luxury I couldn’t afford right now. I needed to consume more caffeine to push away any lingering desire for sleep, even at the cost of my health.\n“By the way, Park Minhyuk, aren’t you studying?”\nYesong asked Minhyuk.\n“My priority is work. Reducing the Leader’s workload is much more valuable and important than some exams.”\nSo he’s putting studies on the back burner.\n“Even without extra studying, I can still outperform you.”\n“Yesong scoffed. “Acting all high and mighty with that memory advantage of yours?”\nShe snickered.\n“Did you forget? You suck at math.”\n“I don’t suck…”\n“Come on, Minhyuk? Don’t you lag behind in problem-solving and arithmetic despite your memory skills?”\n“No… I don’t…”\n“Yes, you do. Shall we compare grades?”\nEven Minhyuk couldn’t withstand Yesong’s teasing.\n“Yeah, you’re right… I suck at math…”\nMinhyuk quickly bowed his head and fell into a state of self-loathing. He was back to his usual depressed state. His mental fortitude was weaker than a thin potato chip. He needed to learn to fight back a little.\nYesong, satisfied with her victory, shot me a triumphant look. What for?\n“Just kidding, Minhyuk! Cheer up, okay?”\nYesong giggled as she grabbed Minhyuk’s shoulders and shook him back and forth. Minhyuk swayed helplessly like a reed in the wind.\n“Leader. Here’s something the student council gave us earlier. Want to try it first?”\nJust then, Baek-seo naturally picked up a snack and brought it to my mouth. Her gentle voice was quite pleasing.\n“Sure.”\nI ate what she offered without hesitation. It was a sweet chocolate pastry. Delicious.\n“…”\nBaek-seo’s smiling face looked like that of a kindergarten teacher feeding a child something tasty and feeling content about it.\nI ate reflexively, but it somehow damaged my pride.\n‘Come to think of it, I’ve never seen her studying…’\nOh Baek-seo. She had always held the top spot in the school rankings.\nYet, I had never once seen her study.\nIn my past life, there were types like her too. They didn’t seem to study at all, but when exams came, they always topped the charts.\nShe must be studying diligently in secret, with stacks of reference books and problem sets.\nShe was exceptional in every way, academically and in terms of abilities. It made her even more of a burden for me. Like an ant standing before an elephant. It was overwhelming.\n“Leader.”\n“?”\nAs Yesong continued to playfully shake Minhyuk’s shoulders, Baek-seo suddenly leaned in, covering her mouth with her hand, and whispered to me in a soft voice.\n“Do you want to study together later?”\n“Hm?”\nWhat?\n‘Together…?’\nA momentary thrill was followed by clarity.\nThis was… an incredible opportunity.\nCaught up in my competitiveness, I had forgotten the basic fact that friends often study together. Baek-seo must have suggested it because she considered me a friend she could be comfortable with.\nThe idea of studying with Baek-seo was as tempting as a juicy fruit, one I wanted to bite into immediately.\nBecause.\n‘I could see how Baek-seo studies…?’\nThere was no way I could pass up this chance.\nEveryone in this office was my rival. No exceptions.\nI had to be the only one to observe how the top student, the unparalleled Baek-seo, studied. Know your enemy and know yourself, and you will never be defeated.\nEven if it seemed petty, there was no helping it. In the face of exams, there’s no room for pride. This was a form of battle.\nBefore Baek-seo could change her mind, I quickly put my hand over my mouth and whispered back into her ear. The urgency to seize the opportunity made my actions hasty.\n“Yes, definitely. Let’s study together later.”\n“…!”\nAs I whispered, Baek-seo flinched. Then, very subtly, her body seemed to tremble.\n…No way, did her body really tremble? Did I see it wrong?\n“Yes…”\nBaek-seo, unlike her usual relaxed manner, pulled away from me a bit hastily.\n“?”\nWhat’s going on?\nBaek-seo’s face held her usual graceful smile. Nothing seemed different.\nWas the odd feeling just my imagination?\n“Zzz…”\nSuddenly, Yoo Doha began to snore. Everyone’s attention turned toward her.\nA brief silence followed her snoring.\nDoha was asleep on the sofa, her skirt slipping to reveal her shorts. She looked like an old man at a sauna.\n“She’ll probably get perfect scores in math again.”\nYesong remarked.\nNot just in math.\nDo-ha excelled in her elective subject, accounting. At least in subjects related to numbers, she was unrivaled. Even Baek-seo couldn’t compete.\nHowever, because she only studied subjects she was interested in, her grades in other subjects weren’t great. Fortunately, her combat abilities were decent enough to keep her overall grades in the upper-middle range.\n‘At least she’s better than Baek-seo at something.’\nI felt a bit deflated.\n‘I need to study…’\nMy eyes returned to the textbook.\n…\n“Weren’t we supposed to study together?”\n“We are.”\n“Then why are we here?”\nBaek-seo and I were alone in the training room.\nIt was a private training space that we had reserved for today.\n“Because it’s more private here?”\nBaek-seo smiled meaningfully.\nI couldn’t understand her true intentions.",

      "content": "Chapter 23 – Rule 12. The Leader Receives Top Marks (2)\nOh Baek-seo began tying her hair back with the hair tie she always wore around her wrist. It was a pretty tie with a small butterfly decoration.\nBaek-seo’s hair was shoulder-length, so the ponytail was short.\n‘What are we even doing here…?’\nThis was a private training room within the school.\nThe fact that boys and girls could be in the same room was due to the presence of CCTV. Whether it was romantic antics or school violence, any behavior against the school rules would be detected by AI, and a student on duty would be sent immediately to intervene.\nNot that there was any chance of Baek-seo and me doing anything like that.\n“Shall we start?”\nBaek-seo said as she finished tying her hair.\nAfter that, we sat side by side at the desk in the training room and began studying.\n“……”\nThe training room was designed for practicing combat techniques, so there were various training tools around.\nWhy did we come here to study…?\n“Are you wondering why we’re studying here instead of a study room?”\nBaek-seo asked as if it was the most obvious thing. It wasn’t surprising that she could read my thoughts by now.\nThere was a partition between our desks. To be precise, we had used a rolling board as a makeshift partition to avoid distracting each other.\n“So, why are we here? I can understand not wanting to be in the study room where everyone can see, but why come to the training room to study?”\nThe office wasn’t suitable for long study sessions because it didn’t have proper desks.\nBaek-seo peeked out from behind the partition and looked at me.\n“Empty classrooms are off-limits at night, and there aren’t many other places to study. I thought of your house, but…”\n“I hadn’t thought of that, but it wouldn’t be a bad idea.”\nBaek-seo would be welcome to come to my house anytime.\nWe could unfold a table and study there.\nThose scenes are common in school romance dramas, where friends study at each other’s houses. It’s a classic trope.\n“…I’m against that idea.”\nBut Baek-seo turned back to her book and answered firmly.\nWhy?\nThis time, I peeked out from behind the partition and looked at Baek-seo.\n“Why?”\n“Today isn’t a good day. I might get… distracted.”\nBaek-seo subtly touched one of her ears—the one I had whispered into earlier today. She didn’t elaborate further.\n“?”\nWhat does she mean?\n‘She’s usually so articulate, why is she being vague now…?’\nThis was the first time I had seen Baek-seo act like this since she joined the Disciplinary Committee. I picked up on it sharply.\nWas there another reason?\nNothing special came to mind.\n‘…Ah.’\n‘Today’ and ‘might get distracted’—two clues.\nI prided myself on being perceptive, and I quickly realized why Baek-seo was being vague.\n‘Could it be that time of the month…?’\nThe ‘magic time’ women experience every month.\nIt made sense. She probably didn’t want to use my house’s bathroom during that time. Even someone as saintly as Baek-seo could feel irritable during that period.\nIt’s well-known that women can get particularly temperamental during that time.\n‘That must be it.’\nWomen typically avoid mentioning it. That’s basic etiquette.\nI understood that much.\nIn any case, it was a topic best left unsaid. I respected Baek-seo even more for maintaining her usual gentle demeanor despite ‘that time.’\n“Yeah…. I guess it can’t be helped.”\n“Can’t be helped?”\n“?”\nBaek-seo looked at me again, tilting her head in confusion.\nWhat now?\n“No, it’s nothing.”\nBaek-seo turned back to her book, seemingly satisfied with my response.\nWas she embarrassed that I had guessed it was ‘that time’?\nIt had to be. Even a perfect girl like Baek-seo is still human.\n‘I should be considerate.’\nTime passed as my pen scratched on the paper, summarizing my study notes.\nBut.\n‘Why don’t I hear anything from her side?’\nThere was no sound of a pen from Baek-seo’s side.\nMaybe her study method didn’t involve writing.\nAll I could see was the partition. I leaned back slightly to get a faint glimpse of Baek-seo.\nShe was sitting upright, studying in a model posture.\nI wondered how Baek-seo studied.\nToday’s purpose was to uncover the study method of the top student.\nI glanced over at Baek-seo.\n“……!”\nOur eyes met immediately.\nBaek-seo was looking at me, seemingly knowing this would happen.\nThe unexpected encounter made my heart pound. Was she watching to see if I was concentrating on my studies?\n“Why are you looking at me?”\nFeeling embarrassed, I glared at Baek-seo.\nI pretended that I had known she was watching me from the beginning.\nI couldn’t be accused of anything since I wasn’t caught off guard while studying.\n“Hmm. I just couldn’t look away.”\nBaek-seo responded with a soft laugh.\n“Why?”\n“Who knows?”\nWas she waiting for a chance to tease me? Or did she find my studying amusing or impressive?",

      "content": "Chapter 23 (Continued)\nIt was pointless to speculate. Her noncommittal answer suggested she didn’t want to explain. Given her tone, it was probably the former.\nI felt a bit deflated.\nMaybe I should just ask directly.\n“…Baek-seo.”\n“Yes, Leader?”\n“I usually understand basic concepts by reading multiple times, then summarize key points in my notes. If there’s too much to summarize, I focus on the confusing parts to save time.”\n“Okay.”\n“That’s how I study. How about you?”\nI employed the ‘ask casually’ strategy.\nI listened intently for the top student’s study method.\n“…I just read.”\n?\n“That’s all.”\n“……”\nI felt my shoulders slump.\nMy head naturally turned back to my book.\n“Really…”\nA sense of disillusionment washed over me.\n‘So, it’s like that…’\nThere’s no royal road to studying. If there were, it would just be an ordinary method done consistently.\nAs long as you progress well in your studies, it doesn’t really matter.\nI felt a bit foolish for expecting some special study method.\n“Sigh…”\nMy mind cleared up.\nIt was like opening a treasure chest with high hopes only to find a note saying, “The treasure is within you.”\nYes, it was anticlimactic.\nI refocused on my studies without much thought.\nTime passed once again.\n‘Oh.’\nWhat should you do for a girl when it’s ‘that time’ of the month?\nNo, my concentration wasn’t broken.\nI was the only one who could look out for Baek-seo. Who else would notice it was ‘that time’ for her today?\n“Baek-seo, I’m going to the restroom.”\n“Alright.”\nPretending to go to the restroom, I went to the convenience store instead, and checked the internet on my smartphone.\n‘…They crave sweets, huh.’\nWhen it’s ‘that time,’ women’s blood sugar and serotonin levels drop significantly, increasing stress and anxiety. As a result, they crave sweets. Thank you, Speed Knowledge!\n‘She must’ve already taken any necessary medication.’\nShe could easily get it at school.\nAnd since it’s a sensitive topic, we’re not close enough for her to share that detail.\nSo I didn’t want to go to the extent of bringing her medication. That would be too intrusive.\n‘I’ll just get these.’\nI bought some snacks and returned to the training room.\nBefore sitting down, I placed chocolate, banana milk, and a straw on Baek-seo’s desk.\n“Hmm? What’s this?”\nBaek-seo looked at the items with a puzzled expression.\n“I got them on the way.”\nI also placed some snacks on my desk, so it wouldn’t be awkward if she was the only one eating.\n“We need to replenish our sugar. It’s exam time.”\nI gave an alternative reason as I sat down. It was my way of being considerate.\nBaek-seo seemed to contemplate my intention for a moment, then smiled.\n“Thank you.”\nDon’t mention it. Of course, it’s right for me to take care of you.\nI just nodded, not wanting to make a big deal out of bringing some snacks.\n“These are ‘Kindi’ chocolates?”\nBaek-seo remarked as she looked at the chocolate.\nWas it last April?\nThe chocolate I bought was something she had eaten during an all-night duty, sharing it with me as one of her favorite snacks. It was branded ‘Kindi’ chocolate.\nI remembered her sharing it with me, saying it was her favorite.\n“You like those, right?”\nI had remembered it, even though it was just once.\nI had always assumed that if I became the leader, Baek-seo would be my closest vice leader.\nI had judged that based on my game knowledge.\nSo I had tried to remember as much about her as possible while treating her comfortably.\n“Yeah…”\nBaek-seo unwrapped the chocolate and took a bite.\nI peeked over the partition at her.\nShe was looking at her book, blushing and smiling quietly. She seemed quite pleased. It must taste good.\nI felt a sense of satisfaction.\nTime passed once again.\n“Oh.”\nJust as I was about to switch to another subject, I realized I had made a mistake.\n‘I didn’t bring the textbook for the other subject…!’\nHow could I make such a critical error…!\n“Leader?”\nBaek-seo called out, seemingly curious about my constant rummaging through my bag.\n“I forgot to bring the textbook for the next subject. I left it at home.”\nI admitted it honestly, even though it wasn’t impressive. There was no point in hiding it. It wouldn’t affect my image much.\n“Don’t you have it in your locker?”\n“I left it at home.”\n“Hmm… Then how about this?”\nBaek-seo suggested something.\nWe stood face to face in the middle of the training room.\n“If it’s Practical Magic and Combat, we can definitely practice together.”\nIf I didn’t have the books for other subjects, I could study something else.\nSince we were in the training room, she suggested we practice the practical subjects.\nEven though I was confident in the practical subjects, I couldn’t take the exams without any practice. So, I decided to master the exam subjects with Baek-seo today.\n“Your magical control should be fine, Leader…. Shall we do martial arts?”\n“Sounds good.”\nMartial arts.\nOne of the practical subjects.\nBaek-seo took off her school jacket and hung it on a chair.\nHer school skirt… seemed fine. It hung above her knees and fluttered, not hindering movement much.\n“Here.”\nBaek-seo handed me a training dagger from the rack. It had a blunt, flexible plastic blade, making it safe.\nShe spun the dagger around her fingers as if she were twirling a pen.\nIt looked quite impressive. It made me want to learn it.\n“Do you want to take the attacking role first?”\nBaek-seo held the blade of the dagger and handed me the handle. I took it.\n“I won’t hold back.”\n“Come at me.”\nI swung the dagger.",

      "content": "Chapter 24 – Rule 12. The Leader Receives Top Marks (3)\nWhoosh!\nBaek-seo easily dodged my sword strike.\nThen she grabbed my extended arm, tripped my leg, and threw me to the ground.\n“Ugh!”\nBaek-seo twisted my wrist, took my dagger, and held it to my throat.\nThe whole process happened so quickly, it felt like it happened in the blink of an eye.\nAlthough I had let my guard down, her skill was impressive even considering that.\nIf we had both used magic to enhance our bodies, the outcome would have been even more brutal.\n“Leader, are you okay?”\n“…I’m fine.”\nI grabbed Baek-seo’s outstretched hand, stood up, and took back the dagger from her.\nWhen did you learn that move?”\nI asked, never expecting her to be this proficient.\n“Wasn’t that an automatic reflex?”\n“I didn’t learn it. I saw it in a BD and tried it for the first time now.”\n“…?”\nI couldn’t believe it.\nThis had nothing to do with magic talent, neither in the game nor in this world.\nI always thought Baek-seo’s extraordinary combat ability came from strengthening her body with overflowing magic.\nBut that wasn’t the case.\nBaek-seo had reached a considerable level of pure martial arts skill.\n“…Again.”\nMy pride was hurt.\nI was confident in my combat skills, having trained hard under my master.\n‘Still, I can do it.’\nIf I focused, I felt like I could respond.\n“Yes. Try again.”\nI swung the dagger again.\nThud! Thud! Thwack!\nBaek-seo deflected my attacks and countered, but I quickly dodged and launched another attack.\nThis repeated.\nNeither of us could decisively overpower the other.\nBaek-seo seemed surprised that I wasn’t easily subdued.\n‘Why are you surprised?’\nI felt the same.\nI didn’t expect my attacks to be this ineffective.\n‘This…’\nAs we continued to spar, I could see the techniques Baek-seo had internalized.\nPeople naturally show their true skills without realizing it.\nI was sure of it.\n‘She must have received professional training.’\nRegardless of talent.\nBaek-seo’s agile and well-practiced movements were at a level that could only be achieved through specialized training.\nEven if she had practiced martial arts taught at the academy diligently, it wouldn’t be enough.\nI could tell, even if others couldn’t.\nStill, it wasn’t something to find odd.\nBaek-seo must have her own untold stories, just as I had never spoken of my gruelling training.\n“……”\nBut it bothered me.\nI suddenly remembered playing the game.\nOh Baek-seo.\nDespite being a strong character, she didn’t have much presence in the game.\nMost characters from different academies than the main protagonist were similar in that regard.\nHowever, Baek-seo was a bit different.\nUnlike other characters, she completely disappeared in the latter part of the game without a trace.\nCould it be that the developers simply didn’t give her much importance?\nThe game community formed a negative opinion.\nAfter the epilogue, Baek-seo’s name was the only one missing from the graduation list at Ahsung High School.\nNo matter which map you visited, Baek-seo was nowhere to be found.\nDid she drop out, or was she expelled?\nThe game didn’t provide exact information, but it was clear she vanished without a trace.\nI kept that in mind.\nBaek-seo was my close companion, someone I cared for, and someone I wanted to marry.\nIf anything happened to her, I would do everything to prevent it.\nSo I couldn’t help but be sensitive to any suspicious circumstances surrounding her.\nPerhaps it was linked to her disappearance.\n“!”\nI seized the moment.\nAnticipating Baek-seo’s counterattack, I grabbed her outstretched arm with my preemptively extended hand.\n“Ah!”\nI pushed Baek-seo’s shoulder back and tripped her ankle with my leg, making her fall.\nThud!\nBaek-seo lost her balance and fell helplessly.\nI immediately mounted her and held the dagger to her neck.\nOn the mat.\nMy shadow fell over Baek-seo.\nI held one of her arms with my free hand, pinning the other under my knee.\nVictory.\nI won.\n“Hoo…”\nI took a deep breath, calming my breathing.\nBaek-seo also took deep breaths, her chest heaving rapidly.\n‘I finally got one over on her…!’\nThe sense of accomplishment felt strong, likely due to my competitive spirit.\nEven though this had deviated from our exam preparation….\nWhat did that matter now?\nI wanted to savor this moment of triumph.\n“…I got caught.”\nBaek-seo smiled under my shadow, then whispered quietly while turning her gaze aside.\n“I didn’t expect to be pinned by the Leader.”\n“Isn’t that phrasing a bit strange…?”\nWhy did her voice sound so suggestive?\n“I meant it literally…. Were you thinking something inappropriate?”\nBaek-seo narrowed her eyes and gave a mischievous smile.\nHer tone was soft.\nI flinched. She was clearly teasing me into imagining something inappropriate. Usually, when Baek-seo did this, it was a joke.\n‘Another one of her jokes….’\nIt was common.\nWhenever I was lost in thought, she’d occasionally ask if I was thinking something dirty.\nOf course, she trusted me enough to joke like that.\nI felt an urge to respond positively and hug her right away.\nIt wasn’t a new feeling.\nPerhaps it was because I was pinning her down.\nBaek-seo looked especially alluring today, making the urge stronger than usual.\n‘…She’s really pretty.’\nWith her hair slightly dishevelled and sweat glistening on her forehead, Baek-seo looked truly beautiful.\nMaybe the romantic feelings I had for her were contributing to this.\nBut at least until I prevented the dystopian future and stepped down as the Disciplinary Committee Leader, I had to suppress these feelings.\nDating was against school rules, and I had responsibilities as the Leader. I couldn’t just date freely.\nOnce I laid down all my burdens, if I had the chance.\nI intended to confess to Baek-seo.\nSo now wasn’t the time for jokes like this.\n“Enough with the weird jokes….”\n“Huhu.”\nMy eyes avoided Baek-seo on their own.\nUnaware of how attractive she was, Baek-seo smiled teasingly, oblivious to my burning feelings.\n“By the way, where did you train?”\nI changed the subject immediately.\n“At school.”\n“No extra training?”\n“I just followed what I learned, and it worked.”\nWas she pretending to be a genius?\nThat’s ridiculous.\nDid she think I couldn’t recognize this wasn’t a matter of talent?\n“Okay, talented one?”\n“Thanks for the compliment.”\nEven so, if she didn’t want to answer, fine.\nI’ll let it go for now.\nI’ll remember that Baek-seo is skilled in martial arts.\nI had no intention of questioning her further on this.\n“How about you, Leader?”\n“I learned from my master long ago.”\n“Master…? That sounds like something from a martial arts novel.”\n“He liked being called that. Anyway, let’s continue….”\nJust as I was about to release her.\nThud. Something fell from my school uniform pocket, hit Baek-seo’s shoulder, and fell to the ground. It caught both our gazes.\nIt was a purple peony charm.\nI picked it up and stepped back from Baek-seo, sitting on the mat. Baek-seo sat up and stared at me.\n“What’s that?”\n“It’s a charm a friend gave me to congratulate me on entering Ahsung High School.”\nBaek-seo tilted her head slightly.\n“Congratulations?”\n“Yeah, peonies are typically given as congratulations.”\n“You must have really liked it, carrying it as a charm.”\nThe peony was quite large, so I had plucked off the petals and stem to make it into a small charm. It must have looked quite painstaking.\n“Yeah, I did.”\nThis flower was from Kim Dalbi.\nDalbi was the first person in this city to become my ally and the first girl I envisioned a future with.\nRegardless of her being a villain, this flower held special meaning for me.\nBaek-seo sat demurely with her knees to the side, staring at me intently.\n“Do you have something to say?”\n“Do you know the meaning of ‘purple’ peonies?”\n“Peony flower language? I looked it up before, and it meant ‘bashfulness.’ Why?”\n“Just curious.”\nBaek-seo gave her usual gentle smile.\nHer expression was still difficult to read.\n“If there’s nothing else, let’s start again.”\nI had no intention of just chatting away the time.\n“I got a bit competitive earlier, sorry about that. Let’s focus on studying now.”\nI stood up.\n“Okay, got it.”\nBaek-seo stood up as well.\n……",

      "content": "Chapter 24 (Continued)\nBefore we knew it, it was late at night.\nWe headed to the subway station to catch the last train.\nOn the path lit by streetlights, the familiar sound of insects chirping from the grass beside the sidewalk echoed.\nBaek-seo carried her bag with her opposite hand.\nAs we walked side by side, our hands occasionally brushed against each other. I didn’t keep my distance because I liked the moment of contact.\nMeanwhile, Baek-seo spoke up.\n“Leader, how about a bet?”\nAn unexpected suggestion.\n“What kind of bet?”\n“A bet on our exam scores.”\n“Hmm.”\nA bet on exam scores.\nNot a bad idea.\nIt would serve as an additional motivation, stroking my competitive fire.\nBaek-seo was someone I needed to beat anyway.\nMight as well go all out.\n“Sure. Bring it on.”\nI agreed without hesitation, and Baek-se\no covered her mouth with her lightly clenched fist, stifling a laugh.\n“A simple wish would be fair.”\n“Fair enough.”\n“Shall we do that?”\n“Let’s.”\n“But no inappropriate wishes, okay?”\n“Why would I make such a wish?”\n“Huhu.”\nOur conversation blended with the insect songs, the night’s stillness, and the dry scent of the earth.\nWhat I wished from Baek-seo.\nNothing special.\nJust that she stays by my side.\nI really liked her.\nOf course, it could be difficult.\nBut my goal was to ‘live happily.’\nNaturally, I wanted to be with the person I liked.\nThough, it wouldn’t be achieved through a wish.\nI thought of something else.\n‘What would be good…?’\nIf I beat Baek-seo and win the wish….\n‘Maybe I’ll ask her to come with me to spend my mileage after midterms.’\nIt would be a light enough wish for her.\nThere would be a clear reason and purpose.\nAnd I could disguise it as a date.\n‘Perfect.’\nIt felt like drinking kimchi soup ahead of time, but….\nI couldn’t help enjoying the thought.\n“Leader, watch out for dog poop.”\nHuh?\n“Whoa! Damn it…!”\nIn a careless moment, I almost stepped on a dog’s faeces by a street tree.\nI quickly lifted my leg and jumped to avoid it.\n“Phew.”\nThat was close.\nI didn’t step on it.\n“Pff!”\n“?\nSuddenly, Baek-seo burst into laughter.\n“Hahaha! What was that!”\nBaek-seo began to laugh uncontrollably.\nIt seemed my reaction was very amusing to her.\n‘Ah, I messed up.’\nI lowered the brim of my hat to cover my eyes.\n‘Ugh….’\nI clenched my mouth shut.\nI felt empty.\n‘What a disgrace….’\nTo show such a pathetic side in front of my vice-leader because of dog poop….\nIt was enough to tarnish my dignity as the Disciplinary Committee Leader.\nThe cool image I’d maintained in front of my vice-leader was crumbling, and I felt a wave of embarrassment wash over me, making my whole body tremble.\nWhat was the cleaning robot doing, not even picking up the dog poop? Dereliction of duty.\n“Hahaha!”\n“…?”\nBut then.\nI sensed something off in Baek-seo’s laughter.\nIt was a sight I’d never seen in the game, and I’d only seen it once last year when we were alone.\nBaek-seo always wore a gentle smile, but she rarely laughed out loud like this.\nEven when a funny senior performed at last year’s Disciplinary Committee dinner, she didn’t laugh.\nWhile everyone else laughed, Baek-seo only smiled softly.\nIn other words, it was a rare scene.\n“Stop laughing….”\nI said, frustrated.\n“Pfft!” Baek-seo laughed even harder.\n* * *\nIn Neo Seoul, a designated residential area in Academy City, there are many security robots.\nTo ensure the safety of the residents.\nHowever, Baek-seo’s residence was located away from the residential area.\nIt also had security robots, though their number was unusually high for a non-residential area.\nBaek-seo studied quietly at her desk, lit by a lamp.\n“Huhu….”\nShe couldn’t help but smile as she recalled the time spent with Leader Ahn Woo-jin.\nResting her chin on her hand, she drew a simple caricature of Woo-jin’s face in the corner of her textbook.\nNext to the drawing, she added expressions like “handsome,” “cute,” “cool,” and “I like you” with several hearts.\nWhat Baek-seo had harboured in her heart was emptiness.\nA product of this dreadful silence.\nSince entering Ahsung High School, only Woo-jin had been able to fill that emptiness, even partially.\nThinking of Woo-jin made Baek-seo happy.\nHappiness stems from fulfilling a lack.\nHowever, Baek-seo still wasn’t sure if she could fully enjoy this happiness.\nHer emotions weren’t easily controlled.\nWhenever she saw Woo-jin, she wanted to joke around and chat happily.\nAs she thought of Woo-jin’s charm, she raised her head, and her smile faded.\nOn her desk, a dried peony flower stood in a vase in the corner.\nIt was a cherished flower she held in her hand with a pretty pink-haired girl in her childhood.\nOnce, it was a beautiful purple.\nShe could remember the meaning of the purple peony well because the girl had told her.\nIt was her honest sentiment.\nBack then, Baek-seo had picked a purple peony too, saying their feelings matched and smiling brightly.\nIt was so long ago that she couldn’t remember the girl’s face clearly.\n“Purple peony….”\nBaek-seo stared quietly at the dried peony.\nPeonies are typically used to celebrate, and their flower language generally holds positive meanings.\nHowever, “purple” peonies are different.\nPurple peonies have negative meanings, which is why they’re usually excluded from celebratory bouquets.\nThe flower language of purple peonies.\n─ “The meaning of purple peonies is ‘anger.’ I read it in a book. Praise my knowledge!”\n─ “Dalbi, watch out for dog poop….”\n─ “Eek! I stepped on it…!”\n─ “Pff!”\nBaek-seo remembered the words of the pink-haired girl.\nThat girl, who had shared her honest feelings, had disappeared, leaving behind resentment and questions.\nShe was now one of the Six Sinners.\nIf Baek-seo caught her, she had things to ask.\nDepending on her answers, she would either punish her, imprison her, or help her.\nThat’s why Baek-seo joined the Disciplinary Committee.\nShe couldn’t track her down alone.\n“More useless thoughts….”\nBaek-seo’s eyes lowered, feeling the heavy silence weighing down on her. She pushed away the distracting thoughts.\nShe didn’t know who gave Woo-jin the purple peony as a congratulatory gift.\nBut that person must have made a mistake giving him that flower.\nBaek-seo thought as much and let it go.\n……\nTwo weeks later.\nThe midterm results came out.",

      "content": "Chapter 25 – Rule 12. The Leader Receives Top Marks (4)\nWhirr.\nIn the Disciplinary Committee office, I was leisurely enjoying my morning coffee when my smartphone buzzed.\n“Whoa!” I exclaimed, nearly spilling my coffee and falling off the chair. Thankfully, neither of these disasters occurred.\nIt was a relief that no one else was in the office.\nI swiftly grabbed my phone and checked the message. As expected, it was a notification to check my exam results.\nMidterms.\nWritten and practical exams.\nEverything was over.\nToday, the comprehensive report card would be released.\nI quickly accessed the academy app.\n‘Please…!’\nMy heart was pounding wildly.\n‘Please let me uphold my dignity as the Leader…!’\nAfter a brief prayer with my eyes closed, I opened the report card with a thumping heart.\nMy grades were….\n[Ahsung High School Midterm Comprehensive Results]\n─ Name: Ahn Woo-jin\n─ Total Score: 98\n─ Rank: 1\n“Yes!!”\nI couldn’t help but shout.\nFirst place.\nI was first place.\nI wanted to open the window, shout, “Take off your pants and scream!” and do a joyful Spider-Man dance on the windowsill.\nOf course, doing that might shatter my dignity as the Leader, not to mention my human dignity. I restrained myself, though the urge was strong.\n“Khaha…!”\nI couldn’t control the trembling corners of my mouth.\nThe joy of being first place had such a powerful impact that even my well-trained poker face was useless.\nI had to contain myself.\nWhen Baek-seo came in, I needed to display the composure of a victor.\nThat was the highest pleasure I could savor at this moment.\nBaek-seo would be here soon.\nTaking a deep breath to calm my emotions, I sipped my coffee.\n“Leader, good morning.”\nFinally, the awaited Baek-seo entered the office.\n“Oh, hello.”\nI greeted her simply.\nFrom her perspective, my face would now be radiating the composure of a first-place winner.\n‘I shouldn’t bring up the grades first.’\nI waited as naturally as possible for her to mention the grades. That too would show the composure of a victor.\nBaek-seo began brewing tea in the kitchenette.\n“By the way, have you checked your grades?”\nHere it came.\n“Not yet. Did you do well?”\nI asked nonchalantly, expecting her answer.\n“Yeah, I got first place.”\n?\n“I tied with someone. Was it you, Leader?”\nWhat?\nI quickly checked my smartphone while she was in the kitchenette.\n‘Oh…!’\nI had only seen ‘Rank: 1’ and was so elated that I hadn’t noticed the ‘Special Notes’ below it.\nNow I saw it.\n[Ahsung High School Midterm Comprehensive Results]\n─ Rank: 1\n※ Tied for first place.\n“…It seems so.”\nBaek-seo and I had tied.\nI didn’t know whether to be happy or not…. My mind was in turmoil.\nThanks to my diligent preparation, I had been hopeful for a good outcome.\nBut this meant I was still not better than Baek-seo…!\n“Leader, would you like some tea?”\n“No, I’m fine….”\nI should be happy about being first, but all I felt was emptiness.\nBaek-seo sipped her tea peacefully at the table while casually browsing internet news on her smartphone. She exuded the true composure and elegance of a first-place winner.\nMeanwhile, I stared blankly at the black coffee in my cup.\n‘If only I had answered one more question correctly….’\nI wanted to close my eyes tightly.\nI didn’t want to adopt the annoying mindset of a study nerd who laments over a single missed question.\nBut the fact that I hadn’t beaten Baek-seo left a bitter feeling in my heart.\n‘Ugh.’\nI swallowed my disappointment with the bitter coffee.\nJust then, the office door opened.\n“Hello….”\n“Oh, hi.”\n“Good morning.”\nIt was Secretary Park Minhyuk who walked in.\nHe looked despondent, his shoulders slumped. He was utterly dejected.\n‘He looks down.’\nAlthough he spent most of the year in that state, he had seemed better recently.\n“Minhyuk, your grades…?”\n“Argh…!”\n“Sorry, I won’t mention it.”\nMinhyuk buried his face in his desk and let out a groan, so I stopped speaking. One more word and Minhyuk might run straight to the school trash bin, sweeping up leaves in despair.\nIn his self-deprecating state, Minhyuk croaked like a zombie, then knelt before me, wailing.\n“Leader, I’m so sorry…! I only managed to rank 45th in the whole school. How can someone like me serve a great leader like you? Please don’t forgive a failure like me…!”\nMinhyuk apologized as if prostrating himself.\nBeing 45th in the entire school should be a high rank.\nApparently, his pride wouldn’t accept that ranking.\n“A worthless piece of trash like me should commit seppuku…!”\n“Hello, Leader, Baek-seo…. Trash Minhyuk too….”\nOnce again, the office door opened, and the discipline enforcement officer Ha Yesong greeted us with a lifeless voice as she entered.\n“Oh, hi.”\n“Come in.”\nThere was no sign of her usual energy. She didn’t head straight for Baek-seo either.\nShe was clearly expressing a ‘Please ask me what’s wrong’ vibe. It was overwhelming.\nThough I had a good guess why, I asked out of courtesy.\n“Yesong, what’s wrong?”\n“Leader….”\nAs if waiting for this, Yesong quickly looked at me, teary-eyed.\n“I guess I was too arrogant, right…!?”\n“What?”\nYesong clenched her right fist tightly against her chest, her body trembling.\nA torrent of futile regret spilled from her mouth like rapid-fire.\n“I was overconfident…! I was fine in my first year, so I let my guard down. If I had known the second-year exams would be this hard, I wouldn’t have wasted time playing around…. Why did I do that? Why was I so foolish and complacent…!?”\n“Are you unhappy with your grades? How bad were they?”\nYesong extended her fingers in a display that lacked any semblance of confidence.\nShe held up five fingers on one hand and three on the other.\n“53rd place is still in the upper ranks….”\n“Both hands…. So, 253rd place….”\n“Oh.”\nGiven the large student body, 253rd place wasn’t terrible, but it was a significant drop compared to Yesong’s first-year performance.\n“……”\nMinhyuk, observing Yesong quietly, stood up and approached her.\nHe placed a hand on her shoulder and spoke in a clear tone.\n“You’re trash.”\nYesong flinched.\nThen she went to the sofa, hugged her knees, and buried her head.\n“I am trash… I’m sorry….”\n“Puhahaha! Ha… ha….”\nMinhyuk pointed at the dejected Yesong and laughed heartily.\nBut soon, realizing his own situation wasn’t much different, he sat across from her and hung his head low.\n“I should have done better…. I feel ashamed in front of you, Leader….”\n“I’ll go on a diet….”\nThe two began a collective lament.\nAs the Disciplinary Committee Leader, I had an obligation to strive for peace and harmony within the committee. But this kind of melancholia didn’t seem worth addressing.\nThen, bang! The door burst open.\n“I’m here!”\n“Oh, hi.”\n“Come in.”\nThe confident voice belonged to the treasurer, Yoo Do-ha.\nThere are three reasons someone could be this cheerful on a day when grades are released.\nEither they scored well, didn’t care about the exams, or had given up on life.\n“Do-ha, did your grades turn out well?”\n“Hmph. Does that matter? I can’t help but be amazed at the academy’s audacity to evaluate me with mere exams!”\n“Well, it’s good you’re positive.”\nI realized that engaging with his middle school syndrome was a mistake.\n……\nAfter school.\nClouds tinged with the evening glow drifted across the sky like flowing water.\n‘Maybe I’ll just finish up the paperwork and head out.’\nWith no urgent tasks today, I decided to catch up on paperwork. Post-exams, things typically slowed down unless something unexpected cropped up.\nI needed to resume volunteer work with Lee Se-Ah soon. Both she and I had been too busy during the exam period to continue.\nThe main purpose was to keep an eye on Se-Ah.\nWith Anomia, the rival of the mafia group Do-hwa, now destroyed, the need for surveillance had increased.\nI had also asked a stoic junior to keep an eye on her. I told him not to actively surveil but to keep an ear out and report any updates on Se-Ah’s activities.\n‘Se-Ah… The more I spend time with her, the less she seems like a bad person….’\nA different impression had taken root compared to what I felt in the game.",

      "content": "Chapter 25 (Continued)\nSe-Ah didn’t seem like someone who could become a villain at all.\nShe seemed suspicious on the surface, but she felt genuinely good-hearted.\nThat didn’t mean there was no longer a need to keep an eye on her.\nNo matter what, she was destined to become a black market mogul involved in illegal activities. I had to be prepared for any eventuality.\nI also wanted to find out why Se-Ah died in the original story.\nAfter capturing Anomia, this question had become more pressing.\nThere was undoubtedly something I didn’t know.\nIf I couldn’t uncover it, even after my term as Disciplinary Committee Leader ended, it would leave a lingering sense of unease, like a piece of meat stuck between my teeth.\n‘Come to think of it….’\nInvestigating the Anomia incident had significantly boosted the committee’s achievements, thanks to capturing numerous sponsors and business contacts.\nHowever, we still hadn’t identified the major sponsor. The mysterious villain who provided Gray Star to Anomia and greatly supported the organization financially.\nAnomia’s leader had claimed not to know the sponsor’s identity, as he hadn’t inquired deeply. A lie detector confirmed his statement was true.\nEven after delving into ledgers, cash flows, transaction records, and official documents, the results were the same.\nIt seemed meticulously planned or carefully covered up from the start. Nothing was certain.\nIt was unexpected.\nWith so much money involved, I thought it would be easy to find.\n‘Who is that sponsor…’\nOne thing was clear.\nTo pull off such an impressive scheme, immense power was a prerequisite.\nThat narrowed the suspects to members of Hanyang Federal Academy, the power center of Academy City.\nAt least someone at the executive level of the student council.\nThey also had to be quite wealthy.\nBut Hanyang Federal Academy was the city’s power hub.\nIt was difficult for Ahsung High School’s Disciplinary Committee to meddle with it.\nWithout solid evidence, confronting Hanyang Federal Academy was a daunting task.\n‘What should I do about this….’\n“Leader, are you thinking about something dirty again?”\n“?”\nA sweet and gentle voice pulled me out of my thoughts.\n“Of course not….”\n“Here, tea.”\n“Thanks.”\nVice-Leader Oh Baek-seo placed the tea on my desk with a bright smile and then pulled up a chair next to me.\n“Hmm?”\nBaek-seo rested her chin on the desk and stared at me intently.\nFor some reason, the sight of her face bathed in the sunset light was mesmerizing. It was almost as if she had a halo.\nWith just the two of us in the office, an intriguing atmosphere filled the air. I felt my face heat up. Fearing things would get awkward, I quickly asked a question.\n“Are you trying to have a staring contest?”\n“Just wanted to look at you for a moment.”\nHer gaze was affectionate, like someone admiring a cute child, which made me slightly uncomfortable.\nIf I had felt she was looking at me like a boy she liked, I might have impulsively confessed to her right then and there.\nBaek-seo was truly beautiful.\nEvery clear day, every evening, I felt immense happiness thanks to her.\nHer face, illuminated by the sunset, was so beautiful that I wanted to take a picture and frame it.\nIt was a visual feast. Sometimes, I found myself losing track of time, wanting to express my affection without restraint.\nBut I had to control myself.\nAn impulsive confession or overt expression of feelings could jeopardize our relationship.\n“A staring contest might be nice….”\nBaek-seo muttered as if she was in a meeting, considering and reviewing opinions.\nShe didn’t specify in what way it would be nice.\n“So, do you have something to say?”\n“I do.”\n“What is it?”\nI asked, hiding my slight disappointment.\n“How should we handle our bet?”\nRight, the bet.\nI had been so upset about not beating Baek-seo academically that I had forgotten to think about it.\n“Well, we need to decide.”\nOriginally, our bet was supposed to be decided by the exam results.\nSince we tied for first place, we had to agree on how to proceed.\n“Can I make a suggestion?”\n“Go ahead.”\n“How about we each state our wishes and then negotiate a middle ground? If we can’t agree, we fulfill each other’s wishes. How does that sound?”\n“That sounds like a good idea.”\nOf course, I’d need to hear her wish first.\n“So, what wish do you have in mind, Leader?”\nI had nothing to hide.\n“I’ve received platinum mileage. I’m planning to use it this weekend, and I’d like you to come with me.”\nRight after the midterms, I checked the student app on my smartphone and saw that I had received platinum mileage.\nThis time, both Kim Yeon-hee and I were selected as recipients of the platinum mileage. Although I had no idea who Kim Yeon-hee was.\nAnyway, I could finally commission a weapon from a platinum-grade blacksmith.\nBaek-seo tilted her head slightly and gave a meaningful smile.\n“Why? Do you want to go with me?”\n“Isn’t it better to go together than alone? Enhancing my combat ability also improves the efficiency of the Disciplinary Committee’s operations, and you’re dependable. So, I thought it would be best if you, the Vice-Leader, accompanied me.”\nI said it casually.\nOf course, I just wanted to spend time with Baek-seo. It felt like a date.\n“If that’s the case, should we just agree on your wish, Leader?”\n“Hmm?”\nBaek-seo stood up with a playful smile.\n‘Wait. What?’\nI liked the idea, but I couldn’t let it end like this.\n“What was your wish?”\n“Since we’ve already agreed to fulfill your wish, there’s no need for me to say.”\nIsn’t that unfair?\n“No, no. Tell me. What was it?”\nBaek-seo shook her head, placed her cup in the kitchenette, and packed her bag.\n“Baek-seo?”\n“Let’s go home now. It’s rare to have free time like this. We should go home early on days like these.”\n“Isn’t it unfair if only I say my wish?”\n“Since we’ve agreed to fulfill your wish, there’s nothing more to say.”\nIt was suspicious.\n“…Were you planning to ask for something awkward but changed your mind?”\n“Who knows.”\nBaek-seo evaded the question with a subtle smile.\n“……”\nShe wasn’t going to answer.\nI felt like pushing further would only make me seem desperate.\n“Fine…, let’s go.”\nSuppressing my curiosity, I stood up.\nWe grabbed our bags, turned off the lights in the office, and walked together under the twilight sky.\n“Baek-seo.”\n“Yes?”\n“I can’t stand it. You should tell me your wish later. I’ll fulfill it.”\n“Will you?”\n“If we leave it like this, I’ll feel indebted. You must tell me.”\n“Huhu, you’re so forceful. Okay.”\n* * *\nThe sky, filled with the colors of sunset, was familiar and beautiful.\nTo Oh Baek-seo, it was an infinitely peaceful scene.\nCars sporadically passed on the road. Walking past a run-down bookstore, she imagined the smell of paper. Passing small shops with pretty signs, delicious scents wafted through the air. The sight of cute cake models displayed in front of a café made her want to taste them with the man next to her.\nAnd a slight turn of her gaze brought her view to the hand of the person she liked.\nTalking about the beautiful cat they saw on the street or the delicious food at a newly opened restaurant.\nThese meaningless conversations with Leader Ahn Woo-jin during their walk home were simply a source of happiness for Baek-seo.\n‘A wish….’\nBaek-seo thought.\nWhenever her hand brushed against Woo-jin’s, feeling the touch of his skin, she felt a desperate desire. The desire to hold his hand.\nShe thought about wishing for that. She pondered for a long time whether to muster the courage, but as expected, she couldn’t bring herself to say it. It would cross the line.\nBuried in such thoughts, a feather-like sensation tickled her chest, making her more aware of Woo-jin than usual.\nAs if waiting for this moment, an optimistic voice in her head, be it an angel or a devil, tempted her to hold his hand now. The reasoning was that there was no need to worry about the consequences.\nBut knowing this moment would end someday, Baek-seo contented herself with the occasional touch of their hands.\n“Baek-seo.”\n“Yes?”\nJust as Baek-seo was about to step onto the crosswalk ahead.\nWhoosh. Woo-jin grabbed her hand and pulled her back quickly.\nThe sound of a passing car.\nBaek-seo found herself in front of Woo-jin’s chest, her hand still in his, momentarily dazed.\n“It’s still a red light. What were you doing, not paying attention?”\nWoo-jin scolded her, looking down.\n“Yeah….”\nBaek-seo glanced at their clasped hands. His hand was wrapped around hers, enveloping it warmly.\nShe felt a strange comfort as Woo-jin’s large hand covered her slender one.\nShe suddenly realized that Woo-jin’s hand was bigger than she thought.\nIt was a cliché sentiment, like something out of a childhood romance novel she had read.\nBut now, Baek-seo understood why such expressions were commonly used.\n“Were you… thinking something naughty?”\nTaking the opportunity, Woo-jin smiled slyly and joked. It was his way of getting back at her.\nBaek-seo immediately recognized it as a joke. But it wasn’t just a joke for her. At least not entirely.\nSkilled at managing her emotions, Baek-seo didn’t show any embarrassment. Instead, she smiled mischievously in return.\n“You’re quite cheeky, Leader.”\n“?”\nWoo-jin was taken aback by Baek-seo’s unexpected response.\nHe tried to maintain a poker face, but Baek-seo could read his expressions clearly. To her, it was simply adorable.\n“Thanks. Let’s go.”\nThe light turned green.\nBaek-seo gave Woo-jin’s hand a gentle squeeze before releasing it naturally.\nThe two of them began walking across the crosswalk again.\n* * *\n─ You should have received the platinum mileage. Check it.\nThe cold, elderly woman’s voice from the phone sent chills down her spine.\nIn front of the phone, Kim Dalbi took out her smartphone and accessed the student app. The platinum mileage was listed under “Kim Yeon-hee.”\n“Yes, I’ve received it.”\n─ Use it to get what we discussed. There’s no other way to obtain it except through the platinum shop.\n“Got it. …By the way.”\nDalbi asked with a wide smile as she spoke into the receiver.\n“Why did you send that strange kid to my district without any prior notice?”\nNarrowing her eyes, Dalbi’s smiling face carried a deadly undertone.\n─ Yes. Your boyfriend decapitated my precious children. I was willing to let it go if it was within reason, but it crossed the line.\nThe elderly woman’s voice carried a hint of a sigh.\n“Isn’t it your fault for relying on incompetent idiots like Anomia? Just a cautious suggestion.”\nDalbi smiled brightly.\n─ …Child.\nThe elderly woman’s voice took on a warning tone.\n─ If you’re a dog, act like one. Don’t do anything you’ll regret.\nClick.\nThe call ended, and silence descended.\nDalbi’s smile gradually faded. She lowered her gaze, her mouth pressed tightly shut. Eventually, she closed her eyes, lifted her head, and took a deep breath.\n“Hoo….”\nRegaining her composure, Dalbi opened her eyes again.\n“Damn old hag.”\nShe muttered softly in a calm tone and walked away.",

      "content": "Chapter 26 – Rule 13: The Leader Does Not Get Ambushed by Villains (1)\nThere are certain sections in Neo Seoul, where the academy city, must remain independent, such as cultured meat and rice polishing factories essential for survival.\nAlthough citizens can engage in livestock farming or rice cultivation, they cannot officially sell these products in the market.\nInstead, they must send an official letter to the Federal Council for a marketability assessment and receive compensation. This policy prevents monopolies in key food industries in a world with limited safe zones. Despite calls for a more capitalist approach, the Federal Council maintains a conservative stance.\nIn other words, some sectors are essentially excluded from the capitalist system.\nOf course, these items are often traded on the black market.\nAnyway.\nThe “New Yongsan Street” where mileage can be used is also considered an independent area. While not directly linked to survival, monopolizing it could lead to significant adverse effects.\nThe Federal Council, the power group that decides the direction and key issues of the academy city, is responsible for managing these matters.\nThe Federal Council is also the entity with the authority to grant me platinum mileage.\nHowever, since it would be dangerous for the Federal Council to recognize monopolies unconditionally, each major academy is granted the authority to monitor their actions and impose sanctions if deemed excessive.\n“It’s been a while since I’ve been here.”\n“Same for me.”\nVice-Leader Oh Baek-seo and I visited New Yongsan Street.\nWe were in our school uniforms, as wearing them was required for entry.\nThe romantic notion of blacksmiths’ workshops with the clanging of metal, dazzling sparks flying everywhere, and intense heat was absent here.\nMost blacksmiths were AI, and the shops were unmanned.\n“There are a lot of people.”\nWhile platinum mileage is rare, regular mileage is commonly granted at the academy’s discretion, making New Yongsan Street crowded every weekend.\n“Leader, be careful not to get lost.”\n“Lost?”\n“You can’t let your guard down. If you’re worried, I’ll hold your hand.”\nBaek-seo mischievously offered her hand as we walked side by side.\nI lightly slapped it like a high-five.\n“Behave yourself. There are Ahsung High students around.”\n“Sorry, my bad.”\nBaek-seo covered her mouth with a lightly clenched fist, chuckling.\n‘…She seems excited today.’\nThough she always wore a gentle smile and carried herself with noble elegance, spending so much time together allowed me to notice her subtle changes.\nFrom the smile on her face now, I could tell her lips were curved about 5 degrees more than usual. She was in a particularly good mood.\n‘But not as much as I am.’\nFrom today, a new weapon of my own would begin to be forged.\nPlus, I was walking down a bustling street on a sunny weekend afternoon with Baek-seo, someone I liked.\n‘I feel on top of the world.’\nEven the warm sun felt beautiful, adding to my happiness.\n“Have you decided where to commission the forging?”\nBaek-seo asked.\nEach blacksmith has unique specialties.\nExcelling in one area often means lacking in another.\nFrom the gold tier and above, the materials used are highly dangerous, so each workshop specializes in different areas.\nThis approach reduces costs and risk significantly.\nHowever.\n“Yes, this way.”\nIn the game, there are unknown master blacksmiths.\nPlatinum mileage is a rare resource.\nWhen commissioning platinum-grade equipment, users tend to prefer the “safe bet” rather than taking risks.\nThey choose workshops likely to produce above-average results for their platinum mileage.\nBut I had a different advantage.\n‘What use is game knowledge if not for this.’\nGame knowledge.\nThe community of experienced players had revealed the efficiency of each blacksmith for different types of equipment.\nI also referred to their guides when using platinum mileage in the game.\nI tried to recall and note down as much as possible after reincarnating. Thanks to that, I still remembered the necessary information. Hooray for guides.\n“This place is good.”\n“……?”\nA secluded location.\nWe arrived at a workshop that seemed much older than the others nearby.\nSeeing the shabby exterior, Baek-seo looked skeptical.\n“Leader…, are you sure about this place?”\nIt was a natural reaction.\nEven I would find it odd from Baek-seo’s perspective if I knew nothing.\n“Usually, places like this are hidden gems in dining districts. Let’s go in.”\nI wasn’t sure if that saying applied here, but anyway.\n‘This place was the best for crafting impact-type weapons.’\nIt was one of the few romantic elements that the game offered.\nA classic cliché.\n“Really…? Then let’s go in.”\nBaek-seo smiled kindly and didn’t ask anything further. As always, she seemed willing to follow my wishes.\nWe entered the workshop. As expected, there were no customers.\nThunk, thunk!\nClang!\nFrom the direction of the workroom, the sound of hammering metal could be heard. The scenery of the workroom was visible through the reinforced glass embedded in the wall. It was a spacious area. Every piece of machinery was automatically operating, continuing the work in progress.\nBaek-seo and I reached the workshop’s waiting room. Then, a friendly receptionist’s face appeared on the wall-mounted TV. It was an AI avatar.\n[Welcome to Deus Atelier. Please state the service you desire.]\nSeveral icons appeared on the screen, indicating the types of services available.\n“Weapon forging.”\n[Alright, weapon forging. Please specify the type.]\n“Expandable baton.”\nAn image of an expandable baton appeared on the screen.\n[Expandable baton, accepted. Are you sure you want an expandable baton?]\n“Yes.”\n[You have selected an expandable baton. Next, we will present several questions to customize your weapon forging. Please answer carefully.]\nVarious questions for weapon forging appeared on the screen.\n‘Look at the material levels… This is crazy.’\nWhen the materials that could be used were listed on the screen, my tongue clicked involuntarily.\nScales of an Ironclad Dragon, boasting the highest hardness.\nLeaves of the Amrdra, amplifying the power of circulating magic.\nBreath of Black Crystal, greatly enhancing water elemental magic.\nAnd many more.\nThere were several materials obtained from dangerous beasts in the outside world.\nForging a weapon with these would essentially mean acquiring final equipment right away. My lips curled up unknowingly.\n“Baek-seo, please wait for a moment.”\n“Take your time.”\nBaek-seo leisurely sat down on a chair.\n‘Since I have lightning attributes, this kind of setup would be good.’\nConsidering the cost, I selected the materials and roughly described the desired design. Several design samples appeared as holographic graphics. I was also informed that the actual result might differ depending on the forging process.\nAfter adjusting the weapon’s appearance with the AI and checking off several more questions, I pressed the ‘Complete’ button.\n[Next, we will assess whether you are suitable to use this weapon. If you do not wish to proceed with the suitability assessment, please answer ‘No’.]\n“Of course, I have to do it.”\n[Alright, we will proceed with the suitability assessment. Please place your hand on the panel.]\nSuitability assessment.",

      "content": "Chapter 26 (Continued)\nIt\nIt was a process to determine if the applicant was suitable to use the forged weapon. It only took place when forging weapons with gold or platinum mileage.\nIn simple game terms, it felt like checking if my level surpassed the level restriction on the equipment.\nIf not, it could also determine by how much I fell short.\nIt was a much more detailed measurement method than the usual magic power measurements done at the academy.\nI placed my hand on the panel in front of me.\nThe measuring device connected to the panel turned blue, and soon…\nZzzt.\nThe screen displayed some noise.\n[Magic power grade, measurement fail…. Anomalies detected…. Please wait a moment….]\nThe AI’s voice was choppy.\nThe lights were flickering continuously.\n‘What? What’s going on?’\nAs I was bewildered, the screen and lights soon stabilized as if the incident had been a simple glitch, and the measurement results appeared on the screen.\n[ Measurement Results ]\n─ Attribute: Lightning\n─ Suitability: S+\n[We deeply apologize for the confusion caused. The magic power measurement results indicate that the suitability is graded as S+, the highest grade. There will be no issues in using the equipment. You will be able to handle it as if it were part of your body.]\nHuh?\n‘Suitability grade S+? For platinum equipment?’\nAccording to the academy’s measurements, my magic power grade was B+.\nIt was quite high, but not to the extent that would warrant the highest suitability grade.\n‘…This must also be due to the Magic Cultivation Technique.’\nI immediately understood the reason.\nI knew very well that the quality of my magic power was good.\nI had been mastering the Magic Cultivation Technique since infancy.\nThis must also be its effect.\nIt’s extremely rare to grasp the Magic Cultivation Technique in childhood.\nTo my knowledge, the only person who managed that was Goliath, who could be considered the final boss of my plan. I had simply emulated Goliath and repeated the Magic Cultivation Technique.\nSuch a thing couldn’t be done just because someone told you to. It was like trying to teach a baby just learning to babble differential and integral calculus.\nEven so, I hadn’t expected the suitability to come out this high.\n“Hm….”\nFacing such a situation, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of pride.\nIt’s like feeling like the protagonist of a comic book.\nAs my shoulders began to rise, reality reminded me that I hadn’t even reached the 5th tier yet, urging me not to get arrogant.\n[Next is the payment stage. The estimated cost is 100 platinum mileage. Please scan the payment barcode.]\nThe price was determined based on the materials, weapon size, and forging difficulty.\nWhen the sample was presented, the price was also shown, so I configured the reference to exactly match the 100 platinum mileage I had.\nSince I was going to get good equipment, it made sense to use all the mileage.\nBeep.\nI scanned the payment barcode from the mileage app at the scanner to complete the payment.\n[Alright, the order has been accepted. The estimated time for forging the platinum-grade weapon is approximately two weeks.]\nMost blacksmith AIs complete forging within one week to one month.\nSo why aren’t they mass-produced?\nBecause forging platinum-grade equipment requires a huge cost and rare materials. Thus, indiscriminate mass production was practically impossible.\n[You will receive a text message once the forging is complete. If you do not claim the forged weapon within one month from then, it will be recycled, and the mileage will not be refunded. Please keep this in mind. Thank you very much for using Deus Atelier. Have a pleasant day.]\nThe friendly AI on the screen bowed and disappeared.\nThe screen then displayed the logo of Deus Atelier.\nClank.\nA receipt emerged from the machine.\nIt was a card.\n‘Ah, they give these too.’\nA fancy receipt card symbolizing platinum grade.\nThe design was satisfying.\nIt was just a symbolic card.\nEven without this card, I could still retrieve the forged weapon.\nStill, I couldn’t help but smile slightly.\n“Vice-Leader, behold the splendor of this platinum card.”\nI waved the receipt card at Baek-seo proudly. It was my attempt at a joke.\n“…….”\n“?”\nWhy… so silent?\nIt was making me uncomfortable.\nAn awkward silence ensued for a moment.\nBaek-seo seemed to be lost in thought.\n“Baek-seo?”\n“Yeah. Congratulations, Leader.”\nBaek-seo regained her smile and stood up.\n“Shall we go now?”\n“…Yeah, let’s.”\nWhat could she have been thinking so deeply about?\nWith the pride of having my own weapon being forged, I followed Baek-seo out of the workshop, feeling a bit puzzled about her behavior.\n* * *\nAhn Woo-jin.\nHe possessed far superior magic power compared to others in the same tier, and his combat abilities were also exceptional.\nHowever, it wasn’t just that Woo-jin was stronger than average.\nMore than that.\nBaek-seo considered Woo-jin to be an anomaly.\nBaek-seo walked through New Yongsan Street with Woo-jin.\nShe kept displaying her usual kind smile and chatted with Woo-jin. But in her mind, she was still fixated on the suitability assessment result from the workshop.\n‘Suitability rating of the highest grade for platinum equipment….’\nBaek-seo gave a wry smile.\nIt was unbelievable.\nThe sword she wore at her waist, ‘Baekryundo,’ was a platinum-grade magical weapon.\nEven as a genius touted as one of a kind, her initial suitability rating for Baekryundo had been B+. That alone was a level most people would admire.\nBut Woo-jin received an S+ rating.\nThe term “unparalleled” seemed insufficient to describe it.\n‘Woo-jin really is a monster.’\nIt wasn’t news.\nShe had always felt that Woo-jin had the potential to become stronger than herself.\nEspecially when she sensed his magic power up close.\nThe purity that facilitated smooth magic circulation, the density that controlled firepower—both were astonishingly high.\nIf all this was summed up as ‘potential for growth,’ Woo-jin’s future strength would surpass any imagination.\n‘…It would have been better if he had average talent.’\nThis was her honest thought that she couldn’t voice.\nWhenever she realized Woo-jin’s talent, an old woman came to mind.\nA detestable woman who coveted talented students, including Goliath, the strongest in Academy City.\nBaek-seo’s eyes turned cold.\nHer resolve hadn’t changed since last year.\nIf that old woman set her sights on Woo-jin,\nBaek-seo would stop her at all costs.\nAt that moment.\n“Baek-seo.”\nThunk. Woo-jin grabbed Baek-seo’s wrist.\nHer reverie was broken.\n“Leader?”\n“Let’s change directions quietly over there.”\nWoo-jin’s expression had grown serious.\nBefore Baek-seo could ask why, Woo-jin spoke in a low voice.\n“There’s a villain.”\nMeanwhile.\nOn a hill.\nA girl with silver hair watched New Yongsan Street.\nShe wore a black mask over her mouth.\nThe name tag on her chest read ‘Kim Yeon-hee,’ an alias.\nShe was Kim Dalbi.\nHer pink and red eyes tracked a student through a small telescope.\n‘Bomber… There he is.’\nThe boy visible through the telescope was a villain.\nNicknamed ‘Bomber.’\nHe must have received an assassination contract from the old woman.\nHis target was likely Ahn Woo-jin.\nDalbi had wanted to subdue Bomber in advance, but finding him had been difficult.\nNow that he was in her sight, she wouldn’t lose him again.\n‘Woo-jin doesn’t seem to be leaving yet.’\nShe had already anticipated Woo-jin’s visit to New Yongsan Street.\nSince Woo-jin received platinum mileage, it was obvious he’d want to use it as soon as possible, and he wouldn’t have had time during weekdays due to his duties as Disciplinary Committee Leader.\nAlthough Baek-seo, who accompanied him, was a concern, that was a problem for later.\nWoo-jin likely had no idea that Bomber was targeting him or what he even looked like.\nThat’s why Dalbi was on a mission to visit the platinum store today.\nBomber might strike amidst the crowd, targeting Woo-jin.\nNo matter how strong Baek-seo was, it would be difficult to fully protect Woo-jin from a skilled villain’s sudden attack.\n“…….”\nBomber’s movements were unnatural.\nIt was the right moment to catch him.\nDalbi moved.",

      "content": "Chapter 27 – Rule 13: The Leader Does Not Get Ambushed by Villains (2)\nI had all the villains I needed to catch recorded and memorized.\nOne of them was ‘Bomber,’ a heinous criminal responsible for eleven bombing incidents.\nSince he was an event villain unrelated to the main story, he became one of my tasks to handle.\nMoments ago, I spotted Bomber among the students in the distance.\nAs soon as I saw his face heading towards the unmanned magazine store, I reflexively recognized him.\nPurple hair, sunken eyes, and a fake lip piercing.\nThese were some of Bomber’s disguises.\nThis information was recorded in my memo based on my game knowledge.\nI had worried about not being able to distinguish his in-game appearance in real life, but I realized those concerns were unfounded. Those features were hard to miss.\n‘Why is Bomber here?’\nI walked casually while pondering.\nBomber usually stayed holed up in his workshop unless there was a special reason.\nIn the game, whenever Bomber went out disguised among people, a bombing incident occurred.\nHowever,\n‘This is the Federation Council’s territory. If he causes an incident here, it’s like openly challenging the Federation Council. Would he do something so reckless?’\nBomber was a villain who wished to witness as many explosions as possible and ultimately wanted to be swept away by a massive explosion.\nEven so, openly challenging the Federation Council seemed excessively reckless for a third-rate villain like him.\nNo matter how much of a Bomber he was, he wouldn’t want to shorten his life.\n‘…I should report this.’\nRegardless, Bomber was a target I had to catch.\nCatching him here would reduce future burdens. I’d save the transportation costs I’d spend to catch him later. That was good.\nAlso, an explosion in this area would cause significant damage.\nI had no intention of letting that happen.\nI took out my smartphone.\nI was about to send a text message to the New Yongsan Control Center.\n“……”\nI paused briefly and slightly pulled the brim of my hat down to cover my eyes.\nI saw Bomber secretly hiding something inside a magazine and then putting the magazine back on the shelf.\nThough my bangs were long enough to obscure my eyes, I clearly saw his lips.\nHe was smiling.\nHe must have thought no one was watching.\nIf I didn’t have game knowledge, I wouldn’t have known he was Bomber either.\n‘His target is either someone around here or me.’\nI knew Bomber’s methods well.\nIf he wasn’t aiming to blow up a building, he preferred using small drone bombs. They allowed him to change the bomb’s location flexibly. However, he wouldn’t deploy a small drone in front of his target. He didn’t want to be caught.\nIf what he placed on the shelf was indeed a bomb, it was the final step. He would likely trigger the bomb when his target passed by the magazine store.\nThat’s why I judged that Bomber’s target was someone nearby.\n“Vice-Leader, we’re starting disciplinary committee activities now. Follow my lead.”\n“Okay.”\nI gently pulled Baek-seo’s wrist towards me, covering my mouth with my hand and leaned towards her ear.\nI briefly summarized the situation and gave instructions. Baek-seo trembled intermittently. It was a slight movement, so I didn’t pay much attention.\nBaek-seo looked at me and nodded.\n“I trust you.”\n“You too, be careful.”\nBaek-seo started moving in the opposite direction.\nAlright, let’s cross one task off the list today.\n* * *\nHis bangs were annoying.\nHow long had it been since he last cut his hair?\nLee Ha-min thought about this as he walked through New Yongsan Street.\nToday was a historic day.\nHe had received an assassination contract from a big shot, and the target was the Disciplinary Committee Leader of Ahsung High School.\nToday, the Disciplinary Committee Leader of Ahsung High School would fall victim to his artistic explosion. The thought sent a pleasant shiver down his spine.\nHa-min stealthily hid himself in an alley.\nHe had completed all the preliminary work to eliminate the Disciplinary Committee Leader.\nMany would be sacrificed in the process, but Ha-min didn’t care.\nIt was rather convenient.\nThe Disciplinary Committee Leader wouldn’t ignore the safety of students.\nHe planned to take the entire street hostage to beat him.\n‘He’s coming…!’\nHa-min smiled.\nWith just a press of the button on his wristwatch, the magic bomb he planted on the magazine shelf would explode.\nHe had specifically targeted the path Woo-jin was walking. Since Woo-jin wouldn’t recognize Ha-min in his disguise, the ambush would definitely succeed.\nHe didn’t expect to defeat him with just the bomb. If it caused enough damage, it would be a success.\nHe had prepared several bombs.\nUsing them, he planned to play a bomb-finding game with Woo-jin, creating a fun scenario.\nFighting like that, he could achieve victory.\n‘Alright…! Let’s have a match, Disciplinary Committee Leader!’\nHa-min couldn’t control his racing heart.\nIn excited anticipation, he panted, waiting for Woo-jin to pass by the unmanned store.\n“Hmm…?”\nThe long-awaited moment.\nA sudden thought crossed Ha-min’s mind.\n‘Where’s Oh Baek-seo?’\nHe remembered that the Vice-Leader of Ahsung High School’s Disciplinary Committee, Oh Baek-seo, had been walking with Woo-jin.\nShe had disappeared at some point.\nIt would have been great to blow them up together.\nBlowing up both the Disciplinary Committee Leader and the genius Oh Baek-seo would have been exhilarating.\nHa-min smacked his lips, feeling a pang of regret.\n‘Well, the target is only the Disciplinary Committee Leader.’\nAnyway, the designated target was only Woo-jin.\nHe just needed to deal with him.\nBlowing up Baek-seo with his bombs would have to wait for another time.\nThere was no time for deep thought.\nSoon, Woo-jin passed by the bomb.\n“Alright, the game starts now.”\nHa-min pressed the button on his wristwatch with a sly smile.\nClick.\nJust before the bomb went off after a brief delay.\nAt that moment, Woo-jin, who had been listening for the faint sound of the bomb, made a dramatic move.\n“!”",

      "content": "Chapter 27 (Continued)\nWoo-jin quickly pushed the students next to him and leaped away from the magazine store.\nAs if anticipating an incident, he had already reinforced his body with magic.\nThey hit the ground.\nBoom!!\nThe bomb Ha-min had planted exploded, sending out a mysterious blaze.\n“Ahhh!”\n“Explosion!?”\n“There’s a bomb! An explosion!”\nThe students passing by were thrown into confusion.\nSo was the person who detonated the bomb.\n“What…!?”\nHa-min couldn’t help but be taken aback.\nWoo-jin had responded at the perfect timing, preventing any casualties.\nEven with animalistic instincts, such a response was unlikely unless he had somehow foreseen the bomb’s detonation.\nWoo-jin wasn’t a seer who could predict the future.\nIn other words, even someone without much insight could quickly understand what this situation meant.\n‘Did he know from the start? That the bomb would go off!?’\nHa-min was in shock.\nWhat had happened?\nWhile Ha-min was grappling with confusion, Woo-jin stood up and dusted off his clothes. His gaze didn’t wander but focused straight ahead.\n“!!”\nHa-min made eye contact with Woo-jin.\nA sharp look.\nCold, teal eyes were fixed solely on Ha-min.\nHa-min instinctively took a step back.\n‘Damn!’\nHe clicked his tongue and discreetly moved. There was a predetermined route in the alley.\nAfter enhancing his body with magic, he quietly ran down the deserted path, confident.\n‘What’s going on? Why? How? How did he find out!?’\nHis disguise, his plan—everything had been exposed.\nOtherwise, Woo-jin wouldn’t have responded to the bomb so quickly and then immediately targeted him.\nSurely, Woo-jin had recognized Ha-min’s disguised form and watched what he did at the magazine store.\n‘Were the rumors true?’\nHa-min had heard rumors that the Disciplinary Committee Leader of Ahsung High School preemptively uncovered Anomia’s plans and was thoroughly informed about their important details.\nHe had also heard that as a result, the large villain organization Anomia was dismantled in a short time.\nAt the time, Ha-min had scoffed.\nHe thought Anomia had been careless with their security, leading to information leaks.\nConsidering the Disciplinary Committee Leader a monster in intelligence warfare was just their overreaction.\nNow, it made sense to him without even realizing it.\nFaced with the current situation, Ha-min’s mind was filled with nothing but intense confusion and questions.\nHowever.\n‘Even if I was discovered, I still have enough bombs.’\nThere were still enough cards left to play against the Disciplinary Committee Leader.\nThe only failure was the ambush.\n‘The game has just begun…!’\nAs he ran, forcing a smile.\nWhoosh!\nA sharp sound pierced Ha-min’s ears.\nBam!\n“Ugh!”\nIn an instant, Ha-min was struck on the head and slammed into the building’s outer wall.\n“What, what the…?”\nIf he hadn’t reinforced his body with magic, he would have been knocked out.\nDazed, Ha-min looked at the entity that attacked him.\nIt wasn’t human.\nA monster with horns on its head.\nClad in a tattered robe, it held an iron club in its right hand.\n‘Goblin?’\nSeeing the strange creature, Ha-min thought of the word ‘goblin.’\nIts appearance was reminiscent of the goblins from folklore.\nClick, click.\nThe sound of footsteps.\nA woman approached.\nHa-min’s eyes widened in astonishment when he saw her.\n“Why, why are you…?”\nHa-min’s voice trembled.\nQuestions arose.\nThe approaching woman had her pink hair tied back.\nShe wore a goblin mask on her face and approached with glowing eyes.\nThose eyes indicated that her magic was active.\nHa-min couldn’t not recognize her.\nIn fact, most citizens of Neo Seoul knew her.\nKim Dalbi, one of the Six Sinners.\nAlso known by many other names like Goblin Princess and Goblin Queen, she was a notorious villain leading an army of goblins.\nWhile Goliath was recognized as the strongest individual in terms of sheer strength, some considered Kim Dalbi, who commanded the goblin army, to be almost invincible.\nHa-min’s mind was in turmoil.\n‘What’s happening…?’\nIt was already bad enough that his plan had been discovered by the Disciplinary Committee Leader, but why was this dangerous powerhouse, Goblin Princess, here in broad daylight attacking him?\nHe couldn’t understand any of it.\nMeanwhile, for Kim Dalbi, this situation was nothing.\n“……”\nShe just needed to knock out the so-called Bomber and leave.\nThe villain disguise was merely a precaution. If a student saw her, she would have to switch back to the ‘Kim Yeon-hee’ disguise and leave New Yongsan.\nAnyway, Dalbi found it hard to remain calm.\n‘It’s a relief that Woo-jin avoided the ambush.’\nDalbi had just let out a sigh of relief.\nShe didn’t know how Woo-jin had anticipated the bomb. However, she was relieved. If Woo-jin had been hurt in the explosion, she would have felt a heart-wrenching pain.\nAfter confirming Woo-jin was safe, Dalbi immediately waited along Ha-min’s escape route, leading to the current moment.\n‘Woo-jin won’t know anything. I need to finish this quickly before he finds out and leave.’\nIt was unlikely Woo-jin recognized Ha-min’s disguised form. Even though he had shown remarkable ability in quickly dismantling Anomia, it was unrealistic to think he could identify individual villains like Bomber.\nSo Woo-jin wouldn’t be chasing Ha-min immediately.\nIf she quickly knocked out Ha-min and fled, she wouldn’t encounter Woo-jin.\nDalbi wanted to see Woo-jin, but she lacked the courage to meet him.\n“Goodbye.”\nDalbi greeted with a radiant smile.\nContrasting her lovely smile, veins bulged on her forehead.\nShe felt like twisting the neck of the man who almost hurt Woo-jin.\n“What is this…? Why are you doing this to me?”\nHa-min shouted, leaning against the building wall in distress. His voice was filled with resentment.\n“Don’t come closer…! Why are you doing this to me? What grudge do you have…!?”\n“We…”\nDalbi’s clear and firm voice cut off Ha-min’s words.\n“…need to know our places.”\n“……?”\nWhat did she mean by that?\nHa-min didn’t understand.\nOne thing was clear.\nThe woman was currently antagonistic toward him.\nLike a cornered rat, Ha-min growled.\n“What nonsense…!”\nAt that moment.\n“?”\nDalbi sensed a presence other than Ha-min’s and flinched.\nShe looked up immediately.\nWhoosh! In the air, a man in a black uniform was falling, making a sound as he cut through the wind.\nThud!\nHe landed on the ground, creating a heavy thud and raising a cloud of dust. Instantly, both Dalbi and Ha-min felt a powerful presence.\nTheir eyes widened in surprise.\nCrackle! The black expandable baton in the man’s right hand emitted teal electricity. Through the dust, he glanced sharply at Dalbi and Ha-min.\n“…You’re here too.”\nIt was Ahn Woo-jin, the Disciplinary Committee Leader of Ahsung High School.\nHe looked at Dalbi and spoke in a calm tone.",

If I hadn’t known how to manage my expressions, my face would probably be a sight to behold right now.\n“…….”\nKim Dalbi’s eyes widened briefly, as if she hadn’t expected to see me here. Then, her expression settled.\nDalbi stared at me and slowly blinked. The time it took felt long.\n“…It’s been a while, Woo-jin! How have you been?”\nDalbi greeted me with a cheerful smile, as if we were friends who had just seen each other yesterday.\nHer voice echoed inside the goblin mask. My heart reacted to that voice.\nThe emotional contrast was stark compared to when I received Dalbi’s letter years ago.\nHearing Dalbi’s voice in person reignited the emotions I thought had long died out.\nThe words ‘I missed you’ were on the tip of my tongue. I swallowed them down with effort.\nI approached Dalbi with my mouth tightly shut.\nBomber Ha-min and the goblin were in the way, but I didn’t care.\n“How is the Disciplinary Committee Leader here…?”\nStill in shock, Ha-min gritted his teeth and pulled a remote control from his pocket.\n“You bastards…, are you ignoring me!?”\nHa-min’s lips trembled as he forced a grin.\n“I still have plenty of bombs…! Hah…! I can kill everyone in this street! I’m not someone you can just ignore…!”\nAs I walked, I leaped towards Ha-min like an arrow, swinging my expandable baton.\nBoom!!\nThe powerful strike and the electric shock wave enveloped him.\nCaught off guard, Ha-min was struck hard on the head and flew through the air.\nBoom!\nHe crashed into the wall again, where he had been smashed before.\nHa-min was silent.\nHe had passed out.\nBomber was an insidious villain who played explosion games while efficiently evading capture.\nWell, it was only troublesome when I didn’t know his whereabouts.\nWhen nearby, he was this easy to deal with.\nI approached Ha-min and casually destroyed the remote and wristwatch.\nI also threw a restraining device.\nClack!\nA belt sprang from the restraining device and tightly bound Ha-min.\nWith that, the hindrance was gone.\nI looked back at Dalbi. She was calmly watching me with her arms crossed.\n‘So relaxed.’\nIt was understandable.\nIt was obvious that Dalbi was overwhelmingly stronger than me.\nDalbi was a powerhouse close to the 7th tier.\nShe could wield the power of goblins, and additionally, goblin troops followed her. In terms of numbers and firepower, her combat strength was second to none.\nIt was a godlike unique ability.\nSurprisingly, unlike other unique abilities, it had no noticeable activation conditions or penalties. If there were any, even the community hadn’t figured them out.\nSo I didn’t know what Dalbi’s weakness was either.\nI only judged that fighting her with the maximum firepower of the Disciplinary Committee was the best course of action. After all, I became the Disciplinary Committee Leader because of monsters like her.\nUltimately, fighting Dalbi here would clearly result in my defeat.\nHowever, I was prepared to fight if necessary.\nThere was no place to escape anyway.\nI reached into my pocket and quickly sent a simplified text message using speed dial number 1 on my smartphone.\nThe recipient was Vice-Leader Oh Baek-seo.\nShe was probably carrying out my orders, identifying the characteristics of the small drone bombs and working with the control room to dispose of them.\nI could give these instructions because I knew how to deal with Bomber.\nNow that Bomber was captured, there was no urgency.\nIt was better for Baek-seo to join me in dealing with Dalbi rather than continuing the mission with the control room.\nCrackle!",

      "content": "Chapter 28 (Continued)\nElectric magic surged through the expandable baton. Dalbi narrowed her eyes, sensing my resolve.\n“You’re going to catch me?”\n“I have to.”\n“Do you think you can?”\n“I don’t know.”\nI shrugged my shoulders nonchalantly.\nThe conversation was devoid of warmth for someone reuniting with a cherished person after a long time.\nBut I wasn’t a big-hearted or powerful person who could afford to relax against Dalbi.\n“First, let me ask one thing.”\nBefore the battle began,\nMany things I wanted to say to Dalbi came to mind.\nWhy she was here.\nWhy she became a villain.\nWhy she said she liked my innocence.\nWhat I meant to her.\nAnd so on.\nI was curious about everything, but it wasn’t the right situation to ask everything.\nStill, among the thoughts swirling in my head, the first thing I wanted to ask Dalbi was clear.\nI asked the question.\n“Why did you leave without a word? You could have told me the reason before you left.”\nI didn’t have the right to keep Dalbi.\nBut at least she could have told me the reason.\nKnowing I would be sad, why did Dalbi just leave?\nDalbi hesitated, then gave me a meaningful smile.\n“Even if I told you now, it wouldn’t matter. We’ve come too far already….”\n“What nonsense is that?”\nWhat’s with this vague attitude….\nA sigh naturally escaped my lips.\n“Just say it. Don’t beat around the bush.”\nDid she think she was the heroine of some drama?\nWhat came to mind were the times I often hugged Dalbi during our childhood, sharing warmth, and the letters she left me after she disappeared.\nIn her letters, Dalbi referred to herself as ‘trash.’\nSpecifically, she said that even though she had become trash, she would always be on my side.\nIt seemed similar to the kind of sentiment that leads someone to put cringe worthy phrases in their messenger profile out of an emotional mood, only to regret it later.\nI wasn’t such a fool to take all that sentimentality at face value.\n“Why did you leave without a word and then leave those letters?”\nI wasn’t generous enough to accept such ambiguous behaviour.\n“…Sorry for being so pathetic.”\nBut Dalbi didn’t give a satisfying answer.\n“As for why I left letters…, I don’t know either. I just felt like it. Leaving without a word had other reasons that I can’t tell you.”\nDalbi gave an awkward smile.\n“But it’s true, you know? I’m always on your side.”\n“Then just say it…!”\n“If I tell you, you’ll die.”\n“What?”\nUnexpectedly, I found myself speechless. My mind was in turmoil.\nWhat kind of nonsense was this? My mind had to race to keep up.\n“…See you later.”\nAs if she wouldn’t continue the conversation, Dalbi turned her back and started to walk away.\nIt wasn’t time to be lost in confusion.\n“The conversation isn’t over yet.”\nI gathered my emotions and steadied myself. Immediately.\nBang!\nI shot towards Dalbi.\nAt that moment, a goblin blocked my path.\nClang!\nI swung my expandable baton, but the goblin blocked it with its club. Crack! The shockwave of electricity pushed the club back.\nApparently, the goblin was caught off guard by the unexpected power.\nThe advantage of the expandable baton was its fast and straightforward follow-up moves. I immediately swung it again, striking the goblin’s torso.\nBoom!!\nCrackle!!\nTwo consecutive electric shockwaves struck the goblin instantly. Unable to withstand the impact, the goblin was pushed back.\nHowever, it didn’t fly away.\nIt barely managed to keep its balance, sliding back and holding its ground.\nIts skin was quite tough.\nIt seemed to have reinforced its body with magic at a high level.\nThe goblin glared at me with its menacing eyes, emitting smoke from its body.\nThe chain reaction of the shockwaves was a skill I had developed after fighting the Anomia guys. It made me realize that my combat experience was gradually accumulating.\nThrough previous experiments, I found that I could deliver about 1.5 to 2 times the damage of a regular shockwave in one go.\nThud. The damage accumulated quickly, and the goblin collapsed on one knee.\nHowever.\nBefore I could charge again,\nSmoke rose from the ground, and another goblin appeared. A menacing giant. The iron club in its hand was as big and heavy as its size.\nTwo goblins blocked my path. Beyond them, I saw Dalbi’s back moving away.\nBoom!\nWhoosh!\nThe giant goblin’s club smashed the ground. Flames erupted from the impact. If I had tried to block it head-on, I wouldn’t have been left with even my bones intact.\nIt seemed the goblin had intentionally controlled its speed. Like a warning shot. It must have assumed I would dodge.\nBeing patronized stung my pride.\nI engaged in a back-and-forth struggle with the two goblins. Their condescending attitude towards me irritated me.\nClack! Taking advantage of an opportunity, I pulled out the Lightning Rod from my belt with my free hand. It must have been unexpected for the two goblins in front of me.\nA strong teal electric current surged through the rod.\nI swung it.\nCrackle!!\nThe lightning engulfed the two goblins, sending powerful electric currents through them. The two goblins collapsed powerlessly.\nBang! I charged towards Dalbi, breaking through the aftermath of the lightning explosion.\nDalbi, startled by the explosion caused by the Lightning Rod, turned to look at me.\nSwoosh!\nDalbi reflexively drew her sword.\nMy expandable baton clashed with her sword.\nClang!\nCrack!\n“Gah!”\nHad she thought I couldn’t get past the two goblins in such a short time? Dalbi, unprepared, lost her balance and couldn’t even properly channel her magic.\nI didn’t know what Dalbi’s story was.\nBut the clear fact remained that she was a villain, and I was a Disciplinary Committee member.\nThe need to subdue and interrogate her didn’t change.\nThe expandable baton, crackling with electric magic, cut through the air towards Dalbi’s neck.",

      "content": "Chapter 29 – Rule 13: The Leader Does Not Get Ambushed by Villains (4)\nRubber-hose cryptanalysis.\nIt is a powerful and professional technique used to extract passwords from a security manager by kidnapping, beating, or torturing them to get the password. It’s an established, albeit brutal, concept.\nThrough the activities of the Disciplinary Committee, I had effectively demonstrated the usefulness of rubber-hose cryptanalysis by beating up villains.\nKim Dalbi was no exception. If she refused to talk, I would have to resort to force to make her reveal her secrets.\nOf course, considering using such thoughts against a powerhouse near the 7th tier was akin to David saying he would use violence against Goliath from the Bible. Yes, it was a laughable situation.\nSo, just as David brought down Goliath with a slingshot, the weaker party had no choice but to exploit the opponent’s vulnerabilities.\nNow was the moment Dalbi was off guard.\nSwoosh!\nThe expandable baton, charged with electricity, shot toward Dalbi’s neck, tearing through the air. The moment felt as if it moved in slow motion.\n‘I don’t know what secret you’re hiding.’\nI thought.\nEven after giving me such a big hint, did she think I’d just stand there clueless?’\nEven though she claimed to have such a secret, Dalbi had always shown lingering affection towards me.\nShe didn’t pride herself on her achievements.\nSo it was obvious.\nThe current situation of Dalbi was a result of something that happened beyond her control.\n‘Even if I don’t know exactly why you said you liked my purity, I think I get a sense of it.’\nA vague silhouette of the truth seemed to appear.\nThere was someone even Dalbi couldn’t handle.\nThat person drove Dalbi to this point.\nIn the days she was with me.\nAnd even now.\n‘So what?’\nI’m not a mind reader, nor do I have the ability to read people’s thoughts.\nNo matter what burdens Dalbi was bearing, if she didn’t tell me, I wouldn’t know.\nEven if revealing the secret resulted in me suffering and Dalbi feeling guilty, if she didn’t tell me, she would ultimately stand as my enemy.\nThus, I had only one choice.\nTo capture Dalbi and interrogate her.\nShe said I would die if I heard the secret?\nI won’t die.\nInstead, I would overcome whatever threat might come my way.\nThat’s why I became the Disciplinary Committee Leader of this Academy City.\nCrack!!!\nCrack!!!\nThe black expandable baton sliced through the moment and thoughts, reaching the enemy and generating two thunderous sounds.\nIt was the sound of powerful electric shockwaves striking Dalbi in succession.\nIf it had been an ordinary villain, it would have ended here.\n“……”\nSoon, the result I had internally anticipated was right before me.\nAs the electric current subsided, I saw Dalbi gripping the black expandable baton with her hand enveloped in flames.\nMy attempt to catch her off guard was thus futilely blocked.\nDalbi quickly enhanced her body with magic, enveloping her hand in dense fire magic.\nI let out a hollow laugh.\n‘Well…, I guess this is to be expected.’\nDalbi had always been an insurmountable challenge, like Goliath.\nIf she had taken this down so easily, I would have been disappointed.\nEven if I continued attacking with the Lightning Rod, it was obvious what the outcome would be. It would just be a show.\nIn that case.\n“…Just tell me, you idiot.”\nIt was better to speak plainly.\nDalbi looked bewildered by the sudden outburst.\n“If you don’t tell me, I won’t know anything. Doing all sorts of ambiguous things without seeking any help until the situation worsens, acting like some pitiful heroine.”\nThere was a bit of emotion in my voice.\nI couldn’t help it.\nIt was frustrating.\nEither stay away completely or stay with me completely.\nSeeing her act ambiguously, as if saying, “I won’t give you the answer you want…,” left me helpless.\n“I’m sorry. I have to go now….”\n“I.”\nNow might be a good time to show a bit of sincerity.\nI felt like I’d regret it later, feeling cringy and asking why I said such things, but I thought I’d regret it even more if I didn’t say it now.\nSo, I finally let out my honest feelings.\n“I missed you. Truly.”\nDalbi flinched, her hair rising as if charged with static electricity. She looked shocked.\nHer eyes trembled like candles flickering in the wind.\n“So just tell me. I don’t want to go through this without knowing anything. Anyway, I won’t die.”\nUsing game knowledge or whatever, I would survive. If I were thinking of doing things half-heartedly, I wouldn’t have become the Disciplinary Committee Leader in the first place.\n“To say something so embarrassing with a straight face?”\nDalbi stammered, avoiding my gaze. She hadn’t expected the words “I missed you” to come out of my mouth.\nI suppressed my emotions and kept my mouth shut.\nDalbi hesitated for a moment.\nThen, with resolute eyes, she looked at my face. Maybe she finally decided to speak properly.\nDark clouds that sounded like thunder slowly filled the sky. Light rain began to fall.\n“…I know it’s shameless, but can I ask one favor?”\nDalbi’s voice was absorbed by the raindrops. I nodded.\n“Let’s just run away together….”\nAt that moment.\nThunderclouds began pouring heavy rain. Simultaneously, a heavy magical presence enveloped my skin, and Dalbi’s eyes widened in surprise.\nSuddenly, a storm hit.\nIf someone said all of this was caused by someone’s magic, no one would believe it.\n“…We don’t have time to talk.”\nWhoosh!\n“Ugh!”\nRealizing the seriousness of the situation, Dalbi pushed me away with the baton and quickly retreated.\n“Take care, Woo….”\nJust as Dalbi was about to say goodbye.\n*Crack!!*\nA fierce roar resonated, blue lightning cut through the air.\nA bolt of lightning struck behind Dalbi.\nWhere the lightning struck, a woman stood.",

      "content": "Chapter 29 (Continued)\nThe lightning caused drones in the sky to malfunction and crash to the ground, shattering into fragments.\nThe thunderclouds covering the sky over New Yongsan Street and the storm on the ground were all under the control of the woman behind Dalbi.\nShe was the greatest force of Ahsung High School.\nOh Baek-seo.\nThe reason she was called a genius in Neo Seoul was not for any other reason. It was because she possessed power that warranted such a title.\nEnormous magical power, outstanding magic precision, and formidable abilities.\nHer unique ability was ‘Cloud Master.’\nUnder the thunderclouds created by Baek-seo, her magic was amplified several times over.\nBoom!\nClang!!\nA swift slash, as rapid as a lightning strike, was parried by Kim Dalbi who quickly regained her stance and raised her sword to block.\nA thunderous sound accompanied by a clear friction noise echoed, and waves of magic spread out, distorting the ground and walls.\n“Oh Baek-seo….”\nDalbi’s eyes narrowed.\n“Hello.”\nThe one who struck with the sword, Baek-seo, spoke in a measured tone.\n“You dared to touch the Leader….”\nSwoosh!\nBrilliant magic, a mix of blue and purple, flowed along the blade. Immediately, several straight sword paths appeared simultaneously in Dalbi’s field of vision.\nThe unique ability, Cloud Master.\nFirst Magic Formula, ‘Butterfly Dance.’\nBaek-seo’s magic attribute was originally water, but thanks to her unique ability to manipulate clouds, she could also utilize thunder.\nThus, using the ability of the Cloud Master, she created a technique that generated multiple lightning strikes. She applied this to her swordsmanship, creating a new technique named Butterfly Dance.\nThe elegant sword strikes imbued with lightning cut through the air with no room to evade. If they hit, even Dalbi’s magic-enhanced body would be sliced like paper.\nDalbi focused, swinging her flame-infused sword continuously.\n‘Clang, clang, clang, clang,’ the metallic sounds of clashing swords and simultaneous explosions echoed. However, unable to block all the attacks, Dalbi sustained deep wounds on her cheek and arm.\nWoo-jin was about to join the fight, but.\n[Graaargh!]\nA goblin suddenly emerged, aiming for Woo-jin’s back.\n“!”\nSwoosh! Woo-jin dodged the goblin’s club swing. Even if it had hit, it wouldn’t have been life-threatening. It was more like a warning shot. It was definitely Dalbi’s intention.\nWoo-jin turned around. Five goblins were targeting him.\nHe had no choice but to deal with them.\nMeanwhile, Dalbi and Baek-seo’s swords clashed incessantly, causing continuous explosions of lightning and flame magic.\nNew goblins also charged at Baek-seo. However, before they could even touch her, their heads were severed or their bodies were cleaved in half, dissolving into smoke that mingled with the rain.\nThey were helpless against Baek-seo’s lightning-fast sword strikes. It looked as if a protective barrier made of blades surrounded her.\nBaek-seo moved through the seemingly slow-flowing time, continuously drawing precise and swift trajectories with her sharp blade.\n“Tch!”\nBarely distancing herself from Baek-seo, Dalbi pushed off the wall and leapt onto the building’s rooftop.\nSimultaneously, numerous wisps of smoke rose in the air, summoning a horde of goblins. They all descended toward Baek-seo, wielding iron clubs, swords, and spears.\nWhoosh! Dalbi began spreading flames from the rooftop. She was clearly up to something.\nBaek-seo extended her sword to the side and bent her knees.\nFor a moment, her figure remained as an afterimage, washed away by the rain.\nIn just a split second, Baek-seo’s magic formed a path through the air. It was a gentle flow, like waves rolling silently.\nThis flow of magic pierced through the descending goblin horde.\nSoon, lightning spread out.\nSwoosh.\nThe sharp sound of the blade cutting through the air echoed softly.\nImmediately.\nSlash, splat!\nThe falling goblin horde’s bodies were cleanly halved and fell to the ground, sprawling lifelessly.\nBaek-seo had already reached the building’s rooftop, leaving a trail of sword paths behind her.\nThe unique ability, Cloud Master.\nSecond Magic Formula, ‘Butterfly Effect.’\nUnder the thunderclouds created by Baek-seo, any enemy who wasn’t exceptionally strong had no significant impact. They just met their end by being sliced.\nUnless Dalbi summoned high-ranking goblins or wielded her own goblin powers, the tide of battle wouldn’t turn.\nFor some reason, Dalbi wasn’t using her full power.\n‘We need to subdue her somehow, now.’\nWoo-jin thought. They had to press Dalbi now.\n“Hoo…!”\nWoo-jin had just defeated the goblins attacking him.\nHe planned to ascend the building and join Baek-seo in attacking Dalbi.\n“……!”\nAt that moment, Baek-seo, still in the air, had a look of surprise.\nOn the rooftop, Dalbi was being engulfed by flames.\nBaek-seo’s sword quickly traced a bright path through the air, but.\nWhoosh.\nThe sword path only managed to split the flames in half.\nSoon, the flames were futilely extinguished by the rain, leaving Baek-seo alone on the rooftop.\n‘She escaped.’\nBoth Baek-seo and Woo-jin on the ground understood the situation.\nDalbi had fled.\nIn the game, Dalbi often spread flames and teleported away unless she was fighting with all her might.\nThe solutions were either to not give Dalbi the chance to teleport or to push her to fight with all her strength.\n“Tch.”\nWoo-jin clicked his tongue.\nConsidering the skill was used in emergencies, it must consume a huge amount of magic.\nGiven that it couldn’t be activated during a full-power fight due to its stringent conditions.\n‘She might still be in the area.’\nHe didn’t want to let her go just like that.\nEven if he ultimately lost her, he needed to extract as much crucial information as possible….\n[Ah, Woo-jin….]\n“A thick, strained voice pierced through the rain, reaching Woo-jin.\nHe turned and saw a goblin, its upper body still intact after being cut by Baek-seo.\n“?”\nAll the other goblins had turned to smoke and vanished. For some reason, this one remained intact.\nWoo-jin approached and looked down at the goblin. It squeezed out its voice with its remaining strength.\n[The master asked me to tell you this…. Because of that woman, the listening ears are gone for a while….]\nIf the goblin referred to its master, it was talking about Dalbi.\nBy ‘that woman,’ Woo-jin figured it meant Baek-seo.\nBut what did it mean by ‘listening ears’?\nSuddenly, something caught Woo-jin’s eye.\n‘…A drone?’\nThe drones that had crashed to the ground with Baek-seo’s arrival.\nThere was nothing else appropriate.\nThe goblin coughed up blood and spoke with difficulty.\n[The master has a plan…. When the plan succeeds, she will tell you everything…. That’s what she said….]\n“What kind of nonsense is….”\nWoo-jin couldn’t finish his sentence.\nHis eyes gradually widened.\nA possibility had suddenly occurred to him.\n“……?”\nWhat Dalbi’s secret was.\nWhy Dalbi couldn’t reveal the secret.\nThanks to the goblin’s message, Woo-jin could guess.\n[So then….]\nSwoosh.\nThe goblin squeezed out its last words and turned into smoke, disappearing.",

      "content": "Chapter 30 – Rule 13: The Leader Does Not Get Ambushed by Villains (5)\n“Head Principal….”\nMy voice was drowned out by the pouring rain. Kim Dalbi, a formidable powerhouse, stood against a daunting backdrop of deadly secrets—secrets that could kill with just a whisper.\nEven within the Federal Council’s jurisdiction, one had to be wary of eavesdropping.\nThere was no concrete evidence, but all the clues pointed to one person.\nAn elderly woman of the old human race, at the pinnacle of Neo Seoul’s power structure in Academy City.\nThe Head Principal.\nThe ultimate authority managing Neo Seoul, dedicated to the city’s development and safety.\nShe served as the equivalent of a ‘Mayor,’ the highest-ranking official in a place without kings or presidents.\nThen again.\nIn the land of no tigers, the fox is king.\nShe could be considered similar to a king or president.\nBut that wasn’t the important issue.\nIn front of her, I’m nothing more than a passing mosquito.’\nAs I pieced together my thoughts, everything began to become clearer.\nI looked at Lee Ha-min, the bomber, who was unconscious and restrained.\nBefore I attacked him, he had already been beaten, likely by Dalbi’s hobgoblin.\n‘His target was me.’\nHow could I not know that Ha-min had targeted me with his bomb?\n‘Was Dalbi trying to stop him?’\nThat made sense.\n‘Sigh….’\nI sighed, running my rain-soaked hair back. My chest felt tight.\nThe real issue was Dalbi’s constant interference on my behalf. If she were just a simple enemy, things would be much less complicated.\n─ ‘Let’s just run away together….’\nSuddenly, I recalled Dalbi suggesting we run away.\nRunning away from a place where escape was impossible.\nWhat was she thinking with that expression? I couldn’t guess.\nEnough.\nI collected my emotions and continued my thoughts.\n‘Anyway, Dalbi had figured out Ha-min’s objective in advance.’\nUsing my game knowledge.\nHa-min must have received an assassination contract, and Dalbi wasn’t superhuman enough to monitor his every move.\nTherefore, ‘Dalbi might have known the contractor. And if that contractor was the Head Principal….’\nIt was strange that a bomber would dare to attack within the Federal Council’s jurisdiction unless he had someone powerful to rely on.\nAdding Dalbi’s actions to the mix, the idea that the contractor was the Head Principal gained strength.\nI didn’t know why Dalbi allowed the bomber to interfere.\nIf Dalbi had been entirely controlled, she wouldn’t have left the letter or approached me.\nThis incident might have been unforeseen by the Head Principal.\nThis hypothesis led to another question.\nThe motive.\nWhy did the Head Principal target me?\nGiven that she used the bomber, an easily discardable pawn, to easily back out if things went wrong, it seemed she didn’t consider me a high threat.\nSo, if she had a reason to target me, it likely wasn’t related to the ‘secret’ Dalbi mentioned.\nOne thing came to mind.\n‘If the Head Principal was Anomia’s top supporter?’\nThis would explain why the supporter was a powerful figure and why the Head Principal targeted me.\nThe main reason Anomia was annihilated was essentially because of me.\n‘…It’s still just a suspicion.’\nI decided to hold off on certainty.\nAfter a brief five seconds of thought.\nI walked briskly towards Lee Ha-min, the bomber.\n‘First, I need to search his belongings.’\nThis was the Federal Council’s jurisdiction.\nAhsung High had no investigative authority here.\nHa-min would be handed over to the Federal Council immediately, and if the Head Principal got involved, he would be silenced for sure.\nSo if I wanted to find anything, now was the only chance.\nI quickly searched Ha-min’s pockets.\n‘…Nothing.’\nNot even a common smartphone, just auxiliary devices likely used in the bombing.\nThen.\nSplash.\nThe sound of water being stepped on.\nI felt the presence of two people behind me.\n“Disciplinary Committee Leader of Ahsung High?” a woman’s voice called out.\nI turned to see a girl in a nun’s habit with combat gear and a boy dressed similarly.”\n‘Spartoi?’\nI instantly recognized their combat attire—they were agents from the Federal Council’s Spartoi.\nI stood up to face them.\n“It’s an honor to meet you. We are Spartoi, under the Federal Council.”\nThe nun-girl bowed politely and greeted me kindly.\nThe other Spartoi followed suit.\nThey were supposed to be Black Ops operatives, but they made no effort to hide their identity.\n“We responded to a report and were dispatched… looks like we’re late.”\nIt wasn’t strange for them to appear, given this was Federal Council territory.\nSpartoi are Neo Seoul’s elite combat agents.\nEven the weakest rank among the 5th Tiers, with many in the 6th Tier.\nThey operate covertly, but if they surfaced, Academy City’s rankings would need reshuffling.\nAt that moment, Baek-seo gracefully descended to the ground. She stood before the two students, showing her doubt.\n“…You know Kim Dalbi has escaped, right? How about controlling the perimeter?”\n“Yes, we went right in! And reinforcements are on their way. Ah, they’ve already arrived.”\nSecurity robots and Federal Bureau students were approaching the alley.",

      "content": "Chapter 30 (Continued)\nThey arrived quickly, likely having pinpointed the location due to the fight between Baek-seo and Dalbi.\n“Disciplinary Committee Leader Ahn Woo-jin. Thank you for stopping the villains and protecting the citizens. I can’t imagine what would have happened without your heroic efforts! Just thinking about it is terrifying!”\nThe nun-girl exaggeratedly clasped her hands to her chest, expressing admiration.\n“Your actions were truly worthy of being called heroic. I’m sure the Lord is pleased!”\n“Indeed.”\n“According to regulations, the Federal Council will grant you platinum mileage. Yes, you’ve done a great service and deserve a fitting reward!”\n“……”\n“…Are you injured anywhere?”\nSeeing my indifferent reaction, the nun-girl tilted her head and asked another question.\nI shook my head.\n“That’s a relief. You’ve worked hard. Leave the man to us. We’ll just need a statement about the incident for the investigation.”\n“Yes… I understand.”\nThe nun-girl’s politeness felt superficial.\nI remembered her from the game; her distinctive attire made her particularly memorable.\n‘This woman was a loyal dog of the Head Principal, wasn’t she? She wouldn’t reveal her identity so easily.’\nI felt the one who sent them was in a hurry.\nI quickly understood the reason.\n‘Did they send them to secure the bomber’s custody quickly?’\nHanding over the bomber Lee Ha-min was inevitable.\nThere was nothing I could do against the Federal Council agents exercising legitimate authority.\nEven if I secured testimony from Ha-min that the Head Principal targeted me, it wouldn’t be enough to bring down the highest authority. It might even hasten my downfall.\n‘Anyway, I’ve obtained important information.’\nKnowing I had to be wary of the Head Principal was significant.\nFighting her legitimately was impossible.\nSince she underestimated me by sending a bomber, causing trouble would be a mistake.\nIt was better to obediently hand over Ha-min.\n“Take care.”\nThere was no need for further conversation.\nI briefly exchanged polite farewells with the smiling nun-girl and moved towards Baek-seo.\n“Baek-seo, are you hurt?”\nBaek-seo shook her head.\n“What about you, Leader?”\n“I’m fine.”\nI answered while examining the drones that Baek-seo’s lightning had brought down.\nThey were all destroyed by the gravitational acceleration.\n‘Federal Council drones….’\nJudging by the markings, they were indeed Federal Council drones.\nIt made sense for them to be here.\n‘Are these the ‘listening ears’?’\nIf Dalbi had been wary of listening ears, it wasn’t limited to the Federal Council.\nIt was right to assume that the Federal Council’s drones were included in the listening ears.\nOnly the Head Principal could have the authority to do this secretly.\nOf course, the Head Principal wasn’t a god. She couldn’t hear every conversation in Academy City.\nPresumably, AI performed the listening ear’s role, detecting any mention of the Head Principal’s secrets.\n‘It’s troubling that it’s not an absurd story.’\nSecurity drones are designed to detect even faint sound waves to quickly identify criminal situations.\nThe Head Principal could abuse that capability.\n‘It’s maddening….’\nMy head throbbed.\nWhy hadn’t I, with my game knowledge, paid attention to the Head Principal?\nThe first reason was that I considered her a minor extra.\nThe second and biggest reason was.\n‘The Head Principal is supposed to commit s*****e by the end of this year.’\nUnlike Anomia, which was annihilated, or Lee Se-Ah, who met a mysterious death.\nThe Head Principal was fated to commit s*****e due to depression this year.\nThere was no doubt about it.\nIt was hard to believe she was plotting something behind Dalbi’s back.\n……\nThe situation was resolved.\nKim Dalbi had completely disappeared, as expected.\nIn the game, once Dalbi teleported with flames, she couldn’t be tracked.\nBaek-seo and I finished our statements and left the New Yongsan Street.\nSince the incident happened in the Federal Council’s jurisdiction, they would naturally handle the investigation. Lee Ha-min’s custody was also transferred to them.\nAlthough my date with Baek-seo ended poorly, I didn’t have the mental space to feel regret. My mind was too cluttered.\n“……”\n“……”\nAs we walked the night streets, a new question arose.\n“Baek-seo.”\n“Yes.”\n“Isn’t your home in the opposite direction?”\nWhy was she still sticking by my side?\nBaek-seo tilted her head with wide eyes, as if questioning why I was asking the obvious.\n“You said I could come to your house anytime, didn’t you?”\n“Well, yes. But it’s late.”\n“I’ll sleep over tonight.”\n……?\n“It might be dangerous.”\n…Isn’t this overprotectiveness a bit much?\nI understood, though.\nShe must have been worried about me after my fight with Kim Dalbi.\n“No need to worry. I can take care of myself….”\n“I’m also hungry.”\nBaek-seo interrupted, looking at me.\nShe smiled and asked.\n“Will you make me ramen?”\n“Ramen?”\nBaek-seo nodded.\nMaybe she wanted to lighten the mood.\nHer determination was evident.\n“……”\nI noticed that Baek-seo’s hands occasionally trembled slightly since the fight with Dalbi.\nShe seemed to hide it naturally, but I, who paid close attention to her, couldn’t miss it.\nSince she wanted to come over, I wanted to help if I could.\nMost importantly, I couldn’t refuse her request for ramen.\n“Sure, let’s eat.”\nBaek-seo’s expression brightened significantly.",

      "content": "Chapter 31 – Rule 14. The Leader Cares for Their Comrades (1)\nIn Lee Doo-hee’s eyes, the panorama of Neo Seoul in Academy City was visible.\nThe dazzling lights that illuminated the night.\nYet, it was blurry.\nHer eyes, now clouded and aged, were afflicted with cataracts.\nHer daily routine involved being connected to an IV drip and moving around in a wheelchair. She had no intention of using healing magic to treat her body. She simply accepted her ailments and lived on.\nBzzz.\nHer old phone vibrated in her lap. Seeing the caller ID, Doo-hee drew a sharp breath.\nCaller ID: ‘1215’.\nDoo-hee answered immediately.\n“It’s been a while since you called…. I thought we wouldn’t need to talk anymore. What’s the matter?”\nA deep smile spread across her wrinkled face. Her voice softened and became gentle.\nIt didn’t last long.\nAfter listening to the other person for a while, Doo-hee’s expression turned grim.\nShe closed her eyes and let out a silent sigh.\n“I see…. So, I shouldn’t mess with Ahsung High’s Disciplinary Committee Leader, is that it? I never thought I’d hear you say that.”\nDoo-hee leaned back in her wheelchair, staring at the blurry ceiling.\nShe had intended to use a convenient villain like Lee Ha-min, the bomber, to deal with Woo-jin.\nThe reasons were clear:\nWoo-jin had thoroughly crushed Anomia, an organisation she had secretly invested in.\nWoo-jin knew too much about Anomia.\nAnomia had its uses, but it was disbanded before it could be fully utilized, which disappointed Doo-hee.\nHowever, it wasn’t primarily about revenge.\nIt was more like being angry that someone broke a pot she had been carefully tending to. Strictly speaking, you can always replace a pot after calming down.\nThus, she used only a minor villain like Lee Ha-min.\nBut things went awry.\nThe unexpected intervention of Kim Dalbi and woo-jin’s remarkable insight in capturing the bomber were unforeseen.\nNow that the attempt to deal with Woo-jin had failed, she saw no need to push further. But it was too late.\nThe cost of targeting Ahn Woo-jin had resulted in an unexpected backlash, scratching at Doo-hee’s heart.\nAfter a long blink, she spoke, trying to calm her emotions.\n“…Very well. If it was bothersome, I apologize.”\nThe call ended.\nShe closed her eyes and placed a hand on her forehead, letting out a deep sigh.\n“What’s so special about him….”\nThe caller, 1215, had warned her not to touch woo-jin.\nThis reaction was something Doo-hee hadn’t anticipated.\nShe was puzzled by how 1215 had known about her targeting woo-jin in the first place.\nDoo-hee had no intention of antagonizing 1215 over something like this. She tried to quell her rising emotions.\nThen, she heard the sound of the door opening behind her.\nA girl in a nun’s habit and a pink-haired girl, Dalbi, entered the room.\n“…You’re here?”\nShe struggled to maintain her composure, speaking in a voice that sharply cut through the air.\nDalbi greeted with a bright smile, saying, “Hello?”\n“You really interfered well.”\n“I told you long ago not to mess with Woo-jin.”\n“That was a condition for you two to separate. It’s unrelated to this matter.”\n“Wow… Playing with words. You’re really senile now. Don’t you think you’re being a bit unreasonable?”\nDalbi hoped to annoy her even a little, speaking slyly.\nHer voice trembled slightly from anger.\n“Child, let me say it again.”\nOnly looking at the cityscape, Doo-hee spoke.\n“Behave like a dog if you’re a dog.”\n“A dog will bite even its owner if it feels threatened. Did you forget that because of your dementia?”\nDalbi retorted immediately.\n“If it feels its precious thing is about to be taken away?”\nDalbi wrapped her aggression in a playful tone.\n“You never back down, do you? You insolent girl.”\n“So? What did you bring me here for? To punish me again?”\n“…Go back.”\n“?”\nDalbi’s expression showed her surprise at the unexpected answer.\n“There’s no point in punishing you anymore.”\n“……”\nDalbi, who had been smiling brightly, narrowed her eyes.\nShe realized something must have happened on her way here.\n“Ye-seo, send her back.”\n“Yes, let’s go, Dalbi.”\nThe nun-girl, Son Ye-seo, escorted Dalbi out the door.\nEven as she was leaving, Dalbi stared intently at Doo-hee’s back. Her white hair, turtle neck, and hunched back were the same as ever.\nThe door closed, and Doo-hee sighed quietly in the silence.\n***\n“It’s humble, but come in.”\n“Excuse me.”\nBaek-seo removed her shoes at the entrance.\nAs befitting a vice leader, even such a simple act exuded elegance.\n‘It feels a bit strange to have her here….’\nIt suddenly hit me.\nI had brought a girl home in the middle of the night.\nShe must trust me a lot to come to my place at this hour. She must also be worried about me.\nBut, I’m still a guy….\nWasn’t she trusting me too much?\n‘Enough. This isn’t the time to be thinking about that.’\nI didn’t want to dwell on the issue of being a man and a woman right now.\nBaek-seo’s occasional hand tremors since the battle.\nIt was likely a symptom associated with the use of her unique abilities.\nWhether she burned her hands or hit her head on a door, she never showed any pain.\nEven she, who had never shown any signs of suffering, was now struggling to hide her trembling hands. I was certain I was right.\n‘I don’t know the conditions or penalties for using her abilities.’\nBaek-seo didn’t want to tell me, and it wasn’t mentioned in the game either.\nIn the game, more than half the time, the conditions or penalties for using unique abilities weren’t specified. Baek-seo, who had a minor role, was one of them.\nSo if she was enduring severe penalties without showing it\n‘I need to take care of her.’\nI just wanted to look out for Baek-seo.\n“Can I use the shower first?”\n“Oh, sure.”\nOur uniforms were soaked and dried due to her abilities. They still felt sticky, and I wanted to shower too.\nIt seemed she really wanted to wash up since she wanted to shower right after arriving.\n“I need some clothes….”\n“Take whatever you want. Something comfortable.”\nShe smiled.\n“Thank you. This will do.”\n“Huh?”\nShe grabbed one of my white dress shirts. It was quite large for her frame.\n“Why that…?”\n“It looks comfortable. Is that a problem?”\n“No… It’s not a problem, just asking.”\nMen often fantasize about their crushes wearing their dress shirts.\nOf course, I was no different.\n‘Is this a coincidence?’\nProbably.\nI shouldn’t overthink it.\nBaek-seo entered the shower.\nSoon, the sound of water began to flow.\n‘Should I eat ramen first and then shower?’\nIt would be nice to serve ramen when Baek-seo finished showering.\nWhen she asked me to make ramen earlier, it reminded me of the phrase “Do you want to come over for ramen?” which was popular in my past life in Korea. It was a euphemism for inviting someone over for s*x.\nStrictly speaking, Baek-seo had straightforwardly declared that she wanted to eat ramen, but still.\n‘…Let’s not think weird thoughts.’\nBaek-seo must be tired too.\nToday, it would be best to just cook ramen, create a comfortable atmosphere, and let Baek-seo relax.",

      "content": "Chapter 31 (Continued)\n‘Let’s boil the water first.’\nI filled a pot with water and set it on the burner.\nAs I watched the slowly boiling water, bubbles starting to form, my earlier worries filled my mind again.\n‘The Head Principal….’\nHead Principal Lee Doo-hee.\nHer face, the elderly woman at the top of the power structure in Academy City, came to mind.\n‘I didn’t expect someone destined to commit s*****e this year to become a problem. Is she behind Dalbi right now? Like a mastermind?’\nIf the Head Principal’s ears were spread throughout Academy City, talking about her as a mastermind wasn’t safe.\nThis place couldn’t be considered a safe zone either.\n‘So I just need to avoid mentioning secrets.’\nI recalled how Dalbi hinted at having a secret but never directly mentioned it.\nAs long as no crucial information was exchanged, the Head Principal seemed to avoid acting overly sensitive. Even her listening devices must have limits.\n‘It must be tough to cover the whole Academy City, and if she makes noticeable moves, she risks backlash.’\nMoreover.\n‘I see why Dalbi didn’t write her secret in the letter.’\nDalbi could have secretly conveyed her secret through the letter without speaking.\nBut she didn’t.\n‘She must have deemed it too dangerous.’\nNo matter how cautious, there was a chance I could unconsciously mention something related to the Head Principal.\nThus, Dalbi probably decided it was better for me not to know the secret at all to avoid burdening me with risk.\n‘Anyway, it’s best to stay cautious until everything becomes clear. The Head Principal might attack again, so I need to be prepared. However….’\nConsidering she sent Lee Ha-min instead of a Spartoi agent, it seemed the Head Principal wasn’t desperate to get rid of me.\nMoreover, she couldn’t completely control Kim Dalbi.\nShe wouldn’t want to risk exposing herself as the mastermind manipulating the six sinners. Taking on such a risk to target me seemed unlikely.\n‘Is Dalbi… okay?’\nDespite Dalbi being an enemy, I couldn’t help but worry about her.\nStill, the hobgoblin mentioned Dalbi had a plan. I could only hope things went well for her and that she didn’t suffer under the Head Principal.\nI could find out her story later.\n‘Ugh, my head hurts….’\nThinking about all this made me tired.\nI suddenly felt the weight of the day.\n‘There’s been too much today.’\nIt was exhausting, really.\nI needed to stop thinking and rest for a while.\nAs the water boiled vigorously, I turned off the burner and headed towards the shower to ask when she would be finished.\nThe sound of water grew louder.\n“Leader?”\nBefore I could speak, I heard her voice. It echoed in the shower.\n“Are you here to peek?”\n“What?”\nWhat nonsense.\n“Hm, I could pretend I didn’t see anything.”\nHer gentle yet playful voice made me feel as if my fatigue was slightly melting away. It was as if her voice had a healing effect.\nMaybe I was releasing dopamine.\nKkIt wasn’t strange.\nHearing Baek-seo’s voice usually made me feel good.\nA smile formed on my lips.\n“As if I came here to do that.”\n“Gasp.”\nAn unnatural exclamation.\n“What?”\n“Then, should we… shower together?”\nAn unsteady voice, naturally laced with mischief.\n“Huh.”\nA small exclamation escaped me, caught off guard by the absurdity of it all.\nThe temptation to close my eyes and go along with the joke was strong, but I held back.\nWe weren’t dating or even sure of each other’s feelings, so seriously considering it could ruin our relationship. I had to respect the trust she had in me.\nBesides, Baek-seo had gone through a lot today and looked exhausted. She was likely trying to lighten the mood. I had to reciprocate her effort.\n“…Why aren’t you answering?”\n“?”\nAh.\nI was lost in thought for a moment, creating a delay.\nShe might have found it suspicious.\n“No, I was just thinking….”\n“Were you seriously considering it? You pervert, our leader.”\n“Pervert…!”\nEven jokingly being called a pervert was unacceptable.\nI was the Disciplinary Committee Leader. I had to protect my image rigidly.\n“Don’t push me into something strange….”\nFrom inside the shower, I heard Baek-seo’s soft laugh, “Huhu.”\n“I’m planning to make ramen for when you’re done. How much longer do you need?”\n“About ten more minutes.”\n“Got it. Towels are on the shelf, so make sure you grab one.”\n“Thanks.”\nI returned to the kitchen.\n***\nThe shower was filled with a dense mist.\nNaked, Baek-seo stood under the stream of water, running her fingers through her hair. She had just finished her playful conversation with Woo-jin.\nShe wiped the steam from the mirror with her hand, revealing her face. Her expression was… not great.\n“……”\nKim Dalbi.\nThere was something she needed to discuss with her.\nThey finally met today but couldn’t talk.\nGiven the circumstances, it was understandable.\nOnce Dalbi had targeted Woo-jin, Baek-seo could only think of brandishing her knife. Talking could come after finding and crushing Dalbi.\nThe problem lay elsewhere.\nBaek-seo suspected the Head Principal was involved in targeting Woo-jin.\nA villain had aimed for Woo-jin in the Federal Council’s territory, and Dalbi had also intervened. To Baek-seo, it was a natural conclusion.\nWhy would the Head Principal target Woo-jin?\nThe exact reason was unclear.\nOne thing was certain: Woo-jin could be in danger again.\nThere was no guarantee that today’s ambush wouldn’t be repeated.\nIf possible, she considered staying with Woo-jin until the Head Principal issue was resolved.\n“…It’s okay.”\nThinking of Dalbi and the Head Principal, Baek-seo whispered to herself.\n“I’ll protect him.”\nShe had already discarded her life once.\nThere was nothing better than risking her life to protect someone she cared about.\n“I’ll protect him….”\nBaek-seo looked down at her hands.\nUnder the bright shower light, her calloused, pale hands were visible.\nWhenever she looked at them, her vision would shift to a dark, asphalt road at midnight, and her hands would appear covered in blood.\nThen in a secluded alley.\nThen in a sealed basement.\nThen on a rainy rooftop.\nHer hands were always soaked in blood in front of corpses.\nThe bright red blood in her memory had faded over time, turning gray.\nBaek-seo hated that sight.\nIt felt like her humanity was fading away.\nThe price of using her unique ability, Wun-sa.\nIt intensely revived her trauma.\nThis was bearable.\nThe only thing that intensified was the persistent sense of dread, which she could endure.\nSevere use of her unique ability would drag out the trauma and erode her mind. She wasn’t confident she could withstand that.\nBut it was okay.\nShe only needed to protect Woo-jin.\nThat thought alone sustained her.\nAs her hands trembled uncontrollably, she clenched her fists tightly, suppressing the memories that floated to the surface.\n“Haa.”\nShe took a deep breath, struggling to calm her emotions.\nFinally, she finished her shower and changed into her clothes.\nHis white dress shirt.\nHis underwear.\nThe shirt’s length covered her groin area, exposing her pale legs. It gave the impression that she wasn’t wearing anything below.\n“Somehow, this feels embarrassing….”\nThere was a reason she chose the white dress shirt.\nA man’s dream.\nA girl he likes wearing his dress shirt.\nShe had learned this from the internet beforehand.\nSo, she chose the white dress shirt to look nice for Woo-jin.\nBut now, seeing herself in the mirror made her blush.\n“……?”\nThe fragrant smell caught her attention.\nThe familiar scent of fabric softener.\nIt hit her that all the clothes she was wearing belonged to Woo-jin.\n“…Sss.”\nShe brought the sleeve to her nose and closed her eyes, savoring the scent.\nThe smell she always associated with Woo-jin filled her senses, replacing the bloody memories with a cozy feeling.\nJust then, the sound of boiling ramen filled the air. Baek-seo finished her light makeup and headed to the kitchen.\nWoo-jin was lost in thought the moment he saw her.",

      "content": "Chapter 32 – Rule 14. The Leader Cares for Their Comrades (2)\nBubble, bubble.\n‘This looks great.’\nThe ramen was cooked to perfection, mouth-watering from every angle.I set out some properly fermented kimchi and meat side dishes, placing a trivet in the center of the table.\nThe ramen pot went on the trivet. The perfectly cooked egg and chewy noodles looked incredibly appetizing. I must have been really hungry.\n“Baek-seo, it’s ready. After seventeen years of eating ramen, this is my masterpiece.”\n“Wow… It looks delicious,”\nBaek-seo murmured in admiration as she made her way to the table. Her gentle voice made even her exclamations sound serene.\nThe familiar scent of shampoo and body lotion reached me.\nI turned my head to look.“Come on, eat….” My words cut off abruptly.\n‘Ugh…!’\nUnbelievable.\nEven though I had anticipated and prepared myself for this, the sight before me was more overwhelming than I had imagined.\nHer hair was still wet from the shower, and she wore only my white dress shirt. Below the shirt’s hem, her pale, shapely legs were exposed. It was an undeniably alluring sight.\n‘My heart…!’\nA sudden shock hit my heart.\nI bit my tongue to control my expression, but the intermittent trembling of my body was hard to hide.\n“Can you give me an apron? I don’t want to splash anything on this.”\n“Here you go.”\n“…Why are you handing it to me so cautiously?”\nAvoiding eye contact and extending my arm to give her the apron must have looked strange.\nBaek-seo tilted her head and silently laughed. It seemed like a knowing smile.\nWe sat across from each other at the table and served ourselves ramen.\nAfter all the exhausting events and head-splitting worries, I had forgotten how hungry I was. This ramen tasted almost as good as the ramen I ate during night marches in my previous life as a soldier.\nI stole a glance at Baek-seo. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear and used her chopsticks to pick up some kimchi and noodles together. She looked adorable.\n‘If I get married, will I see this every day?’\nA moment ago, I was consumed with grim thoughts, but now, a wave of happiness washed over me.\nWhen I’m struggling, I look at Oh Baek-seo.\nJust seeing her is healing.\nBut I couldn’t just indulge in her beauty without a care.\nI continued eating ramen and thinking.\n‘…She doesn’t know about the relationship between the Head Principal and Dalbi.’\nWithout my game knowledge, various clues, and the hobgoblin’s message, I wouldn’t have been certain that the Head Principal should be considered a target.\n‘For now, it’s better if I’m the only one who knows. It’s hard to explain, and it would just burden her. I’d prefer if she could rest peacefully for now.’\nI glanced at Baek-seo’s hands. Though her trembling had subsided, I couldn’t help but worry about her.\n“Leader, you cook ramen well,”\nBaek-seo suddenly spoke.\n“I’ve eaten it often enough. This is basic.”\n“You could be called a ramen master.”\n“What’s with the way you talk? Anyway, if you want more, just let me know anytime.”\n“You’re a perceptive little rookie, aren’t you?”\nBaek-seo joked, smiling gently. Then, while eating ramen, she asked an unexpected question.\n“By the way, has anyone else visited your house besides me?”\n“?”\nWhat kind of question was that?\nOf course, there had been.\n‘Other than Dalbi visiting frequently when we were kids, no one.’\nI hadn’t invited anyone else over.\n“Not since a friend came over in the past. Why?”\n“…It’s nothing. Just curious.”\nBaek-seo shook her head.\nWas she worried someone might drop by in the middle of the night?\n‘That’s understandable.’\nIf a friend suddenly showed up and saw Baek-seo and me together, how would they react?\nWell, there was nothing to worry about.\n“I see.”\nWe dropped the subject and continued eating ramen.\nEvery time Baek-seo entered my sight, I couldn’t help but focus on her outfit.\n‘She looks beautiful….’\nIt was impressive.\nThe mind is heavily influenced by the body. Given my youthful vigor, it was hard not to be stimulated by the sight of a beautiful woman wearing only my dress shirt.\nEspecially when the person in question was someone I liked.\nThe stimulation was so intense that I couldn’t stand up from the chair. I had to silently recite the national anthem to calm myself down.\nAfter we finished eating the ramen, Baek-seo stood up.\n“Thank you for the meal. I’ll do the dishes.”\n“No, guests should rest. I’ll take care of it.”\n“Really…? But why aren’t you getting up?”\n“I just remembered something to think about. Go ahead and rest.”\nDespite reciting the national anthem four times, it hadn’t had much effect. I must have lacked patriotic fervor in my past life.\nBaek-seo watched me for a moment before giving a slightly awkward smile.\n“Okay…. Next time, I’ll do it.”\nFortunately, she left the room.\n‘That was close….’\nIn the end, I had to recite the Lord’s Prayer and the Heart Sutra to get through the crisis. Truly, the power of faith was great.\nAfter finishing the dishes, I returned to find Baek-seo sitting on the sofa, scrolling through her smartphone.\nI wanted to just pick her up and…!\n“I’m going to shower.”\n…With that impulsive thought, I quickly headed to the shower.\n***\nWhile Ahn Woo-jin was showering, Oh Baek-seo looked around his home. She found his middle school graduation album.\nShe carefully touched the picture of Woo-jin with short hair. It was a side of him she didn’t know.\n“……”\nTonight, she planned to pretend to sleep until Woo-jin fell asleep, then stay awake and keep watch with White Wheel Sword by her side. She couldn’t be sure when a threat might come.\nSo, she kept White Wheel Sword close to her. Outwardly calm, she remained vigilant internally.",

      "content": "Chapter 32 (Continued)\nShe remembered something Woo-jin had said.\n─ ‘Other than a friend coming over in the past, no one.’\nNo one had visited recently.\nAt least, it seemed to be a fact for Woo-jin.\nBaek-seo recalled the white porridge from the day Woo-jin had the flu, not knowing who made it. Who could have prepared that and left it behind?\nEspecially in a residential area with many security robots, without Woo-jin noticing…?\nBaek-seo operated her smartphone, deploying personal security drones she had prepared nearby to Woo-jin’s address. It was possible because she had obtained approval from the local security team.\n“For now, I guess I’ll stay with Woo-jin….”\nShe murmured to herself.\nIt seemed best to stay by his side until she was sure of his safety.\nLiving with Woo-jin would be ideal, but that was obviously not feasible.\nAside from seeking his permission, she didn’t want to intrude on his privacy.\n“So then….”\nShe might need to dip into her savings soon.\nEventually, Woo-jin came out of the shower, changed, and entered the living room.\n“Baek-seo.”\nThen.\n“Want to watch a movie?”\n“?”\nAn unexpected suggestion came from Woo-jin.\nA short while later, with all the lights turned off, the two sat side by side on the sofa, covered with a blanket. Woo-jin started the movie.\n“What movie is it?”\n“A superhero movie. Have you seen it?”\n“I haven’t seen this one. Let’s watch it.”\nThough it was a sudden situation, Baek-seo realized that Woo-jin was trying to be considerate and remained quietly appreciative.\nThe TV started playing a superhero movie, a relic of the old human culture.\nA genius inventor in an iron suit flying through the sky, a man in tights with spider-like abilities, a blue-suited man with a shield—various heroes fighting evil villains with their skills.\nAlthough it was an old movie made before the mystical power of ‘magic’ appeared in the world, the city in the movie was not much different from present-day Neo Seoul.\nAccording to history, humanity’s culture and technology regressed while billions perished. Thus, it made sense that the environment now was similar to the past.\nWoo-jin was engrossed in the movie. Oddly, his eyes reflected a sense of nostalgia. Baek-seo preferred watching Woo-jin’s expressions over the movie itself.\n“Ah.”\nWoo-jin suddenly gasped.\n“What is it?”\n“I forgot something important.”\nWoo-jin brought over a large container of snacks and drinks, and they began sharing them.\n“……”\nSnuggled under a warm blanket, watching the movie together, Baek-seo felt a deep sense of contentment despite maintaining a state of vigilance.\nBaek-seo subtly rubbed her forehead.\nHer hand tremors had subsided, and the unwanted thoughts had faded. This improvement was likely due to the penalty of her unique ability, Wun-sa, easing over time, but the recovery speed was surprisingly quick.\nAs the movie approached its climax, Woo-jin’s eyes started drooping, his head nodding. He hadn’t fully recovered from his fatigue and was struggling to stay awake.\nBaek-seo pretended not to notice and kept watching the movie silently.\n“Baek-seo.”\n“Yeah?”\nSensing he was about to fall asleep, Woo-jin spoke in a subdued voice.\n“Recently, I set up new security drones. If anyone intrudes, an alarm will go off. So… I can escape if things get bad. Don’t worry too much.”\nHe was trying to reassure Baek-seo.\n“Okay, I’ll keep that in mind.”\nBaek-seo responded with a gentle smile.\nWhen the movie ended and the credits started rolling, Baek-seo turned her head. Woo-jin was fast asleep, his head resting against the sofa.\n“…Careless, Leader. What if someone attacks you?”\nBaek-seo whispered playfully in a very soft voice.\nShe stood up, contemplating whether to lay him down, then carefully placed his head on her shoulder.\nIgnoring her racing heart, she leaned her head against his.\nBaek-seo closed her eyes slowly.\n“You know everything….”\nShe said softly.\n“Pretending not to know.”\nThey had already sensed each other’s feelings.\nConsidering everything they had shown each other, it wasn’t hard to guess.\nHowever, Baek-seo was perceptive.\nShe had long realized Woo-jin was carrying significant burdens as the Disciplinary Committee Leader.\nShe didn’t know exactly what those burdens were, but she knew Woo-jin had no time to be distracted. She respected his dedication to his role.\nThus, Baek-seo had already resolved herself.\nShe would silently follow Woo-jin’s path.\nGradually integrating herself into his life until the day he could finally set down his burden as the leader, she would naturally reveal her feelings.\n“…Good night.”\nBaek-seo whispered, gently placing her hand over Woo-jin’s.\n***\n“Oh Baek-seo here. I’ve just moved in next door.”\n“……?”\n“Would you like some rice cakes for the housewarming?”\nA new neighbor had suddenly appeared.",

      "content": "Chapter 33 – Rule 15. The Leader Has a Dedicated Weapon (1)\nLKim Dalbi browsed photos of Ahsung High School’s disciplinary committee executives on her smartphone.\nLeader: Ahn Woo-jin. Vice-Leader: Oh Baek-seo.\n“…”\nShe already knew they were together. Dalbi often observed Woo-jin, wanting him to be safe.\nBoth were deeply connected to her childhood.\nHow they ended up entangled like this, she couldn’t fathom. The world felt cruel.Memories of New Yongsan Street resurfaced.\nWhat remained most vivid wasn’t her confrontation with Woo-jin or her clash with Baek-seo. It was the image of the two strolling down the street, side by side.\nThat sight stabbed at her heart like needles.\nDalbi pressed her smartphone against her forehead, closed her eyes, and bowed her head.\nA heavy silence enveloped her.\n* * *\nThe outside was bustling with the sound of movers and robots carrying luggage.\nAt first, Woo-jin thought a new person had moved in next door, but then Oh Baek-seo greeted him directly. She explained that she’d discovered the vacancy next door and signed an automatic lease.\nSome residential areas in Neo Seoul, like this one, were city-owned. You could sign a lease through an app and move in right away.\nAll you needed was money. And no entry ban.\n“Why didn’t you tell me…?”\n“Does it bother you?”\n“Not really. Just thought you could have given me a heads-up.”\nBaek-seo stroked her chin, humming in thought. Then, she spoke.\n“… I’ve decided to stay close to the Head for the time being.”\nBaek-seo went on to explain.\nShe had moved in next door because she was worried about him.\nHe was targeted by a bomber and clashed with Kim Dalbi. She wanted to be nearby, ready to intervene if anyone else targeted him.\nHe had no right to object.\nIt wasn’t illegal; she wasn’t intruding; he had no moral obligation to her, and strictly speaking, they weren’t even dating.\nIt was Baek-seo’s choice.\n“I apologize, but please understand.”\n“It’s nothing to apologize for…”\nStill, this was… a little much.\n‘This is overprotective.’\nWas she his mother?\n‘Well… it’s not like I mind having her around.’\nBoth in terms of security and daily life, having Baek-seo close by would be beneficial in many ways.\nHe offered to help her unpack, but Baek-seo firmly refused. She didn’t want to show him her private life.\nFor Baek-seo, who was always relaxed and generous, to refuse so directly meant she was dead serious about it. So, he didn’t push it.\n‘Well, she can’t be completely perfect.’\nBaek-seo must have a secret or two she didn’t want to share. Especially someone like her, known as Ms. Perfect, might have unique quirks.\n‘…I’m curious.’\nHe wondered what it could be. Curiosity burned, but he suppressed it.\nIt was best to respect her privacy. Just like how he wouldn’t want anyone to find his hidden folder full of Brown-eared Bulbul videos.\n“Head, want to have dinner together?”\nFrom then on, as if it were natural, Baek-seo brought over side dishes or cooked at his place and they had meals together.\nThe next morning, too.\nBaek-seo, wearing a pink apron, appeared at his door.\n“I made too much food. Shall I pack you a lunch?”\n“Uh… well, thanks.”\nHe ended up taking the lunchbox Baek-seo had prepared and headed to school with her.\n“Let’s have dinner together at least once a week, okay?”\n“Why?”\n“I want to cook for you sometimes. You know I enjoy it.”\nThis was getting…\n“Now that I think about it, I should probably get to know this neighborhood. Could you show me around later?”\n“Is there anything to show? Like walking paths or good restaurants.”\n“Yes, I like those.”\nThis was definitely…\n“If you’re ever bored, just call me. I can at least be a listening ear.”\nThis was really…\n‘This feels like dating… without actually dating.’\nTo be precise, it was a relationship that felt like a couple, but wasn’t.\nIt was too strange to be just friends, too ambiguous to be declared lovers. Somewhere in between.\n‘It feels like we’re building a life together.’\nCome to think of it… looking back, he realized something.\nStarting with the egg mayo sandwich, the virus called Oh Baek-seo had gradually infiltrated his territory. And now, she had reached a point of no return.\nHe had a feeling that if she were to disappear, it would leave a gaping hole in his life. A hole that would be filled with a deep emptiness and loneliness.\n‘I guess I should be grateful…?’\nAs he mentioned before, he was focused on fulfilling his duties as the Head of Discipline, and then confessing to Baek-seo.\nOf course, he was anxious. Baek-seo could grow distant, or her heart could be captured by another man.\nBut Baek-seo’s recent actions, what could he call them? It felt like she was saying, ‘I’m ready to be with you.’\nAs if she knew his plan and was acting accordingly.\n‘Am I overthinking it?’\nMaybe he was getting ahead of himself. However.\n‘…Still.’\nDangerously.\n‘This is… happiness…!’\nThe stress from work, the pressure from future knowledge, all seemed to be neutralized by Baek-seo.",

      "content": "Chapter 33 (Continued)\nHe was overflowing with motivation.\n“Thinking dirty thoughts again?”\n“Don’t say weird things while we’re walking…”\nHe was innocent. He wasn’t thinking about anything inappropriate.\nHe was just pondering what to name their second child.\n…\n“Gasp! Head, you’re alive!”\n“Isn’t that obvious…”\nThe Disciplinary Committee office.\nHa Yesong, upon seeing Woo-jin, exclaimed in surprise. She rushed towards him. He had expected this reaction, considering the chaos she caused on CocoTalk.\n“Jtube and SNS are still going crazy! Catching a bomber, confronting the criminal Kim Dalbi…! It was a huge deal!”\n“It was.”\nThe incident at New Yongsan Street had become a major topic. His heroism in catching the bomber and driving away Kim Dalbi was highlighted, adding tangible achievements to the Ahsung High Disciplinary Committee’s record.\nOther districts might be different, but being in debt to the Federal Council meant bonus points for the school, whether they acknowledged it or not. Naturally, the Disciplinary Committee’s evaluation would improve.\n“The Leader creates major incidents even on his day off! Is this also a quality of a good Leader?”\n“Don’t make me sound like a jinx.”\n“Hehe.”\nYesong giggled playfully and approached Oh Baek-seo, linking arms with her.\n“Baek-seo, I’m so glad you’re safe!”\n“Me too.”\nAs Baek-seo gently patted Yesong’s head with a kind smile, Yesong beamed.\n“Head, I have so much I want to hear about today!”\n“I can tell.”\n“Let’s hear it over lunch! I’m looking forward to a lively story!”\n“Ah, right, it’s lunchtime.”\nIt seemed Yesong had come during lunch break specifically to hear their story firsthand.\n“I brought my lunch! Salad. I’m on a diet, hehe.”\n‘You’ll be eating again soon.’\nHe had precognitive abilities, but they only worked on Ha Yesong.\n“You two ordered delivery?”\n“Let’s eat together. We have lunchboxes.”\n“Wow…!”\nYesong gasped in admiration. Why?\n“Not just Baek-seo’s, but the Leader’s lunchbox too. This is precious. I want to see it!”\nCome to think of it, she was right.\nHe usually just grabbed bread and milk from the cafeteria for lunch.\nThey moved to a table and placed their lunchboxes down. As they opened their lids, a brilliant light seemed to emanate from them.\n“!”\nNeatly packed white rice. A perfect amount of black seaweed. Spotless rolled omelet, glistening stir-fried pork, egg-coated meatballs, fresh tomato slices, and green vegetables.\nA perfectly ordinary yet perfect lunchbox world unfolded before his eyes.\nHe couldn’t help but smile. It was like a lunchbox lovingly prepared by a wife for her husband, filling him with a strange warmth. This was a feeling only a lunchbox could evoke.\n“Head.”\nYesong narrowed her eyes, observing his lunchbox.\n“Why is it the same as Baek-seo’s?”\nA sharp question.\nThey had different lunchboxes, but the contents were identical, hence Yesong’s suspicion.\nThere was no need to hide it.\nIn fact, he felt a bit smug, wanting to show off his girlfriend’s skills. Was this what it felt like to boast about your significant other?\nHe felt a pang of guilt and doubt for having such thoughts when they weren’t even dating. He needed to control himself.\n“Baek-seo prepared it. She made extra, so she made mine too.”\n“Aha~. As expected of our angelic Baek-seo! Taking care of the Head’s nutritional balance too!”\nYesong nodded in understanding, not finding it strange at all. Baek-seo had such a kind image after all.\nBaek-seo, with her usual gentle smile, responded.\n“So!? What happened during the weekend!?”\nYesong swiftly changed the subject.\nFor a while, Woo-jin and Baek-seo recounted their experience at New Yongsan Street. They omitted the part about the Principal, of course.\nYesong listened intently, captivated by their dynamic storytelling.\n* * *\n“Leader, Baek-seo! It’s lunchtime!”\nA few days later, at the Disciplinary Committee office.\nHa Yesong decided to have lunch with Ahn Woo-jin and Oh Baek-seo.\n“I see Baek-seo packed lunch for the Head again today! I’m so jealous~.”\nAnd a few days after that.\n“Heehee, let’s have lunch together!”\nAs expected, Yesong joined Woo-jin and Baek-seo for their meal.\n“Looks like Baek-seo made lunch again today…”\nYesong noticed something odd.\nAnd the next day.\n“Lunch time!”\nYesong witnessed it again.\n“….”\nAs if it were the most natural thing, Woo-jin revealed the lunchbox Baek-seo had prepared.\nAnd the day after that.\nAnd a few days later, too.\n‘What’s going on…?’\nYesong felt a strong sense of suspicion as she looked at Woo-jin’s lunchbox.\nIt wasn’t just occasional; it was strange for Baek-seo to prepare lunch this frequently.\n‘I also heard rumors about the Leader and Baek-seo coming to school together…’\nThe source of the rumors were the Disciplinary Committee members.\nThey took turns patrolling the school gates every day, so they had witnessed the Leader and Vice-Leader arriving together.\nNaturally, rumors began to spread amongst them that the Leader and Vice-Leader might be dating.\nAt first, Yesong brushed it off, thinking ‘no way’. However…\n‘Packing lunch every day, coming to school together every day…’\nA spark went off in her mind.\nAt this moment, the puzzle pieces clicked into place.\n‘…They’re 200% a thing.’\nSince when?\nYesong stared at Woo-jin and Baek-seo seriously. Baek-seo was looking at Woo-jin with a gentle smile.\n“Our Head eats well, doesn’t he?”\n“Stop treating me like a kid…”\n“Hehe.”\nYesong finally sensed the strange atmosphere surrounding the two.\nA bead of cold sweat trickled down Yesong’s cheek.\n* * *\nAfter the confrontation with Kim Dalbi, there were no further attacks from the Head Principal.\nDespite their vigilance, they detected no suspicious activity.\nPerhaps her earlier assessment was correct; the Head Principal had no reason to risk another attack. Or maybe something had happened to the Head Principal.\nIt was difficult to track her movements, as she rarely engaged in public activities that required her direct involvement.\nIn any case, he was grateful that she was underestimating him for now. He would make sure to return the favor when the opportunity arose.\nAnd.\n“Ready, Ahn?”\n“Of course, Oh.”\nToday was the momentous day he would finally receive his dedicated equipment.\nWoo-jin headed to Deus Atelier in New Yongsan Street with Oh Baek-seo.",

      "content": "Chapter 34 – Rule 15. The Leader Has a Dedicated Weapon (2)\nI inserted the platinum-grade access card into the slot.\n[The platinum-grade equipment you ordered is ready for pickup. Please reply ‘Yes’ if you wish to receive it.]\nThe AI on the Deus Atelier screen spoke in a friendly tone.\n“Yes.”\n[Very well, I will guide you to the location. Please allow approximately 5 minutes for equipment retrieval.]\nOh Baek-seo and I moved to the room the AI guided us to and waited. After 5 minutes, a large case arrived in front of me on a rail.\n*Shhh!*\nThe case opened with a hiss of heat.\n[A three-section staff of lightning attribute, crafted with the highest quality, named ‘Iron Dragon Staff’ by our Deus Atelier.]\nInside the case was a three-section staff, perfectly straightened and secured with friction locks.\nThe exterior was exquisitely covered with the scales of a black ‘Ironclad Dragon’.\nGrooves lined the precisely arranged magic circuits, resembling electronic circuitry.\nThe thickness was slightly thicker than my previous staff, and the length was a bit longer.\nInside the staff, ‘Lightningwing’ petals would be lined up. Lightningwing was a mystical flower that only bloomed in the heart of the Thunder God Beast’s territory, where lightning poured like rain. The petals fluttered like waves, greatly amplifying the power of lightning magic.\nMost of the mileage was spent on the petals because of their high value.\nAnyway.\n‘Iron Dragon Staff…?’\nI pondered, stroking my chin.\nThe name is pretty cool.\nIron and Dragon.\nWasn’t it a name that combined only cool elements?\nConsidering the exterior that clearly showed the Ironclad Dragon scales, it seemed like an appropriate name.\n‘Originally, I was going to name it ‘Excellent Conversation Starter’.’\nI had thought of that name because I didn’t want to give the equipment a cheesy name.\n‘I stand corrected….’\nHearing the name ‘Iron Dragon Staff’ from the AI made my blood boil with excitement.\n‘The name ‘Excellent Conversation Starter’ is cheesy, but it also lacks romance.’\nIt was a shameful thing that I, as a man, couldn’t tolerate.\nOriginally, cheesiness and romance were separated by a thin line.\nNow that I had acquired my own personal weapon, it was only fitting to give it a cool name.\n[If you don’t like the name, we can change it….]\n“I like it. Iron Dragon Staff. It’s good.”\n[I’m glad you like it.]\nLet’s see.\nI grabbed the Iron Dragon Staff.\n‘Ah, this cool and heavy feeling….’\nA strange sensation flowed from my palm throughout my entire body. It was as if the Iron Dragon Staff was judging whether I was worthy of being its owner.\nWell, that was too romantic of an expression….\nIt was just ‘magic resistance’ kicking in.\nThe lower the magic compatibility with the equipment, the more severe the magic resistance.\nAs a result, it became difficult to operate magic through the equipment, and even caused pain. To use it, I would have to act pathetic.\nHowever, my magical compatibility was top-notch.\nThe sensation the Iron Dragon Staff conveyed resonated within me like a soundboard, only aiding my magic circulation.\n‘Thickness, length, durability, weight, grip. All satisfactory.’\nAs my magic flowed through the Iron Dragon Staff’s circuits and circulated throughout my body, I could sense how powerful a weapon this three-section staff was.\nThe AI said so.\nThat I would be able to use this three-section staff like an extension of my own body.\nI think I knew why.\nBecause it fit perfectly in my hand, even though I hadn’t used it yet.\n[Would you like to test the equipment?]\n“Yes, please.”\n[Activating the training dummy range. Please select the desired level of the dummy. Levels range from 1 to 10 and….]\n“The sturdiest one, please.”\n[Level 10 selected.]\n*Creak!*\nOne of the walls went up, revealing a giant training dummy. Like in games, that dummy boasted a level of hardness that wouldn’t budge from normal attacks. Even if I fired a shotgun or a cannon, it would only leave a scratch.\n*Woooosh!*\nAs the hologram image activated, the training dummy took on the form of a monster. It roared.\nThe hardness of the dummy according to its level was the same in all training grounds. This is because there cannot be any difference in the sandbags used to test newly forged equipment.\nAnd Level 10 was a level that only those who were at least in the upper ranks of the 5th Tier and equipped with platinum-grade equipment could attempt.\n‘Good.’\nA level I wouldn’t have even looked at normally.\nBut the moment I held the Iron Dragon Staff, I was convinced that Level 10 was worth a try.\n“I’ll be right back after hitting it once.”\n“Sure. Fighting.”\nBaek-seo smiled casually.\nI approached the training dummy.\nI activated the magic circuits. The magic gathered in my lower abdomen spread evenly throughout my body. I poured that magic into the Iron Dragon Staff.\n*Bzzt!* With the sound of electricity flowing, blue-green magic circulated within the Iron Dragon Staff’s circuits.\n‘Let’s go.’\n*Whoosh!*\nKicking off the ground, I swung the Iron Dragon Staff towards the training dummy with all my might.\n*Thud!!!*\n*Crackle!!!*\nAn explosive roar.\nAlong with the heavy impact, multiple shockwaves of electricity engulfed the training dummy.\nThe amplified magic, thanks to the Iron Dragon Staff, was released powerfully. Ferocious lightning danced in the air, and a strong gust of wind momentarily sucked in the air.\n*Crash!* The monster screamed and was driven straight into the wall. This was because the ankle of the training dummy, which was fixed to the ground, had been blown off.\n*Zzzt.* The hologram flickered with static. Then, the form of the training dummy, hidden by the monster skin, was revealed. It was bent in half from a single blow.\n“Wow….”\nI heard Baek-seo’s exclamation of admiration behind me. It was the first time I had heard such a genuine exclamation from her.\nI was just as surprised.\n‘That was crazy….’\nHow much was my magic amplified with that blow?\nI couldn’t tell.\n‘…As expected, gear makes all the difference.’\nRealizing the immutable truth once again, I looked down at the black three-section staff, named the Iron Dragon Staff.\nMade of Ironclad Dragon scales, it continuously emitted blue-green electricity along its straight magic circuits. As if leaving an afterglow.\n‘This is sick.’\nThe corners of my lips curled up.\nMy heart began to flutter involuntarily.\n“Thank you. I’ll put it to good use.”\n[You’re welcome. Have a good day.]\nI wanted to get it enhanced right away, but I couldn’t because I didn’t have any platinum mileage left.",

      "content": "Chapter 34 (Continued)\nThe Federal Council had sent an official letter stating that they would compensate me with platinum mileage for the New Yongsan Street incident. However, according to the rules, it would be given after the final exams, so it was still a long way off. For now, I had to be satisfied with the unenhanced Iron Dragon Staff.\n*Click.*\nI channeled a small amount of magic into the groove of the handle and pressed the end of the Iron Dragon Staff, causing the staff to retract inwards. Then, I inserted the now-shortened staff into the holster on my belt.\n“Baek-seo, let’s go.”\nBaek-seo smiled faintly and tilted her head at me.\n“Chief, you seem excited.”\n“Hmm? No way…? I’m the same as always.”\nWe left the Deus Atelier.\n“Do you like it? The power was no joke,huh?”\n“It’s beyond my expectations.”\nWith the Iron Dragon Staff, I might even be able to land a proper blow against Kim Dalbi.\nThe reason I thought of Dalbi for comparison was that my attacks didn’t seem to work on her last time.\nIt might have been a different story if I had launched a series of attacks, but my consecutive attacks wouldn’t work on Dalbi, who even blocked Baek-seo’s.\nOf course, I had no intention of harming Dalbi. However, if a situation arose where I had to subdue her, I would have to wield this three-section staff.\n“It fits my hand perfectly. I like the weight and how sturdy it feels.”\nCome to think of it….\nI need to practice controlling my strength with this.\nBecause if I swing this at an average rule violator, it wouldn’t just end with a fracture.\n“That’s good.”\nBaek-seo smiled faintly.\n“It would hurt if it hit me too.”\n“Hurt…. Right….”\nIt was an answer that made me realize the difference in our skills, which I sometimes wanted to forget.\nI don’t think I can beat Baek-seo even with the Iron Dragon Staff.\nBut there was no need to be discouraged.\nI had finally gotten my hands on the dedicated weapon I had been longing for. This might even allow me to develop various techniques. I was only going to get stronger from here on out.\nWell, that could wait.\n‘The timing is good. I’ll have to deal with the Six Sinners soon anyway.’\nIn the game, the Six Sinners caused incidents all over Academy City and made headlines.\nThe game was designed in a way that the players would constantly come across news about the Six Sinners, making them think, ‘It would be fun to fight them’.\nThe academies were some of the stages where the Six Sinners wreaked havoc. Although the Six Sinners didn’t appear at Seoin High, where our protagonist Lee Tae-sung attended, other academies were different.\n‘One of them will attack Ahsung High soon.’\nI didn’t know why.\nIn the game, there was news that one of the Six Sinners had invaded Ahsung High.\nI couldn’t figure out the exact details of the incident. Maybe it was because Ahsung High was far from the main stage of the game? I wasn’t sure.\nEven if I could figure out the details, I might not have known because I was a casual player.\nAnyway, I had to be prepared.\nHowever.\n‘I don’t know how Ahsung High’s security is breached….’\nIt was a question without a clear answer.\nSince one of the Six Sinners appeared in the game, Ahsung High’s security would be breached. But I couldn’t help but have doubts based on my experience at Ahsung High.\nThis was because, as a major academy, Ahsung High’s system was well-designed to thoroughly prepare for external intrusions.\nMoreover, security was strengthened last year because of the incident where magical beasts broke in during the exams. Even I felt reassured.\n‘…Let’s put that question aside for now.’\nBecause there was no way I could find a clear answer at the moment.\nI should eat now.\n“I’m hungry, want to grab something to eat?”\n“Leader.”\n“What?”\n“I have somewhere to be today. I’ll head there first.”\n“?”\nBaek-seo said with a faint smile.\nUsually, Baek-seo was specific with her words. The fact that she wasn’t mentioning it meant that she didn’t want to talk about it. That’s why I didn’t bother asking, ‘Where?’\n‘Is it something personal?’\nLast time, I realized that Baek-seo had a personal life she didn’t want me to know about.\nEven if it weren’t something like that, I didn’t feel like prying. I was just disappointed that our date in New Yongsan Street was canceled.\nI guess our date would have to wait until I came back to enhance the Iron Dragon Staff.\n“Alright. I’ll go on ahead then.”\n“Okay. I’ll make dinner later, so wash your hands and wait.”\n“?”\nIs she my mom?\n***\nThe navy blue sky was chasing away the sunset. It was the time when night approached.\nListening to the chirping crickets, Oh Baek-seo climbed a hill and arrived at a small playground. It was a secluded playground with nothing but a slide, a seesaw, and a swing set.\nThere was a girl there.\n*Squeak, squeak.* The sound of the swing. She was sitting quietly on the swing, her toes touching the sand.\nFlowing pink hair. Hanyang Federal Academy uniform without a name tag.\n“You’re here. It’s been two weeks, right?”\nKim Dalbi, one of Academy City’s terrorists, greeted without making eye contact.\nBaek-seo stopped and looked at Dalbi with an indifferent expression. However, Baek-seo’s left hand rested on the sword at her waist.\n“Hello.”\nBaek-seo greeted back with a faint smile.\n“What a face I’ve been wanting to see.”\n“I’ll take that as a compliment.”\nDalbi reacted playfully.\n“…”\nBaek-seo narrowed her eyes.\n“It’s convenient to have a high Tier, isn’t it? There’s something called presence that only those in the 6th Tier can feel.”\n“You’re telling me. You were blatantly revealing your presence.”\nBaek-seo shrugged.\n“Why did you call me? Unless it’s something important, I’m going to draw my sword.”\n“Something important?”\n“Then I’ll draw it a little later.”\n“You’re still drawing it either way.”\nBaek-seo hadn’t called the Disciplinary Committee on purpose. Dalbi seemed like she wanted to talk.\nBaek-seo also wanted to talk to Dalbi before apprehending her. There was something she needed to ask and information she wanted to extract. In the current atmosphere, it seemed possible.\n“Well…, I’m not planning on fighting today. I have something to tell you.”\nDalbi said firmly, looking at Baek-seo.\n“Just give me three minutes. I have something to tell you about your Disciplinary Committee Leader….”\nIn the blink of an eye, Baek-seo plopped down on the swing next to Dalbi.\nIt was so fast, it was like she had used Flash Steps.\n“Go ahead.”\n“Wow…, you’re more straightforward than I thought.”\nDalbi chuckled in admiration.",

The Leader Scolds a Comrade\n“Did you come here just to talk?”\nKim Dalbi, sitting on a swing next to Baek-seo, spoke.\nWhen Baek-seo didn’t respond, Dalbi smiled and continued.\n“…You know, I’ve been under strict control lately. But recently, the surveillance has loosened up a bit, so I came to find you. It seems ‘that person’ isn’t doing well.”\nSecurity drones, programmed to detect any mention of the Head Principal, roamed the city. Dalbi referred to these as the ‘listening ears’.\nSo, Dalbi referred to the Head Principal as ‘that person’ to avoid detection by the listening ears.\n“Start with the story about the Leader,”\nBaek-seo squinted and spoke firmly.\n“If you asked for just three minutes, doesn’t that mean we only have about three minutes since we met?”\n“Well, actually, three minutes was just a rough estimate. It could be shorter. There’s not much to talk about anyway.”\nDalbi handed Baek-seo a folded paper.\n“Here. Burn or eat it after reading.”\nIt was a letter containing the message she wanted to convey, prepared in advance knowing there wouldn’t be enough time for a conversation.\nBaek-seo unfolded and read the paper.\n“……”\nSoon, she ignited a spark and burned the letter.\nDalbi proudly extended her index finger upward.\n“From now on, what I say will be like an intro to a movie….”\nAt that moment, Dalbi stopped speaking and narrowed her eyes. The movements of the ‘listening ears,’ the security drones patrolling the area, had become unusually erratic.\n“…This won’t work. They’ve already noticed.”\nThe Head Principal realized Dalbi had disappeared.\nDalbi stood up from the swing, looked down at Baek-seo with a playful smile, and placed a finger on her lips.\n“Keep today’s meeting a secret. Since I’ve given you information, you’ll stay quiet, right? Let’s end it with, ‘Hey, next time we meet, we’re enemies.’”\nBaek-seo slowly blinked and sighed.\n“Can I ask you one thing?”\n“No.”\n“Why did you leave me?”\nBaek-seo recalled the half-year she had spent with Dalbi.\nDalbi pondered, saying, “Hmm.”\nA memory of Woo-jin and Baek-seo walking together through New Yongsan Street flashed through her mind.\nStill smiling, Dalbi answered.\n“It wouldn’t mean much to tell you now. It was my choice.”\n“……”\n“Take care. See you later….”\nSwish!\n“Ah.”\nSuddenly, a sword struck.\nDalbi gracefully bent backward to avoid the strike, letting out a gasp. At that moment, bright flames bloomed from her body like petals.\nIn front of Dalbi, Baek-seo, holding her sword, glared coldly.\n“I didn’t say you could leave.”\n“It’s already too late.”\nDalbi laughed mischievously.\nWhoosh!\nIn an instant, Dalbi’s body was engulfed in flames, and another sword strike cut through them.\nWhoosh. The flames died.\nDalbi had vanished.\nDalbi had been prepared to use her escape technique from the start. She had no intention of fighting.\n“…Such a troublesome ability.”\nBaek-seo sighed.\n***\n[ Do not disclose the contents you’re reading now! Specifically, the parts related to the Head Principal. ]\nBaek-seo couldn’t find Dalbi in the end.\nAs it got late, Baek-seo did some quick grocery shopping on her way home, recalling the contents of Dalbi’s letter.\n[ Your Disciplinary Committee Leader has been targeted recently due to the Head Principal’s light retaliation. You guys dismantled the Anomia organization that the Head Principal was secretly nurturing, didn’t you? I don’t know why the Head Principal raised such an organization secretly or why she kept it at such a scale, so think about that on your own. ]\nIt explained the reason for the New Yongsan Street incident two weeks ago, helping Baek-seo grasp the context.\n[ Anyway, it seems he’s currently observing the situation for some reason. Whether his mind has changed or he’s gone senile, I don’t know. ]\nWhen she read that paragraph, Baek-seo understood why Dalbi had called her.\nAt that time, they had barely any time to talk, so she had to quickly grasp the letter’s contents. Even in such a situation, Baek-seo quickly understood the parts about the Head Principal.\n[ And be careful. ]\nNext, Dalbi had written another important piece of information.\n[ One of the Six Sinners is hiding in your school as a student. I don’t know who it is, but don’t get caught off guard. You can talk about this information. Discuss it with your Leader. ]\nThat was the end of the letter’s contents Baek-seo recalled.\n“……”\nOne of the Six Sinners is hiding in Ahsung High School as a student.\nBaek-seo was conflicted about whether to believe it. After all, Kim Dalbi, one of the Six Sinners, wasn’t exactly trustworthy.\nBut she couldn’t figure out what benefit Dalbi would gain from lying about this.\nSo, was it information given out of old friendship?\nThat was also unknown.\nBefore she knew it, Baek-seo arrived at Woo-jin’s house.\nBeep beep.\nBaek-seo naturally unlocked the door and went inside.\n“…Baek-seo?”\n“Huh?”\nBaek-seo stopped abruptly.",

      "content": "Chapter 35 (Continued)\nThe moist air brushed her skin.\nSoon, Woo-jin, drying his hair with a towel, came into Baek-seo’s view.\nBaek-seo swallowed a gasp as Woo-jin’s bare skin filled her sight.\nA moment of silence followed.\nWoo-jin glanced down at his body.\nWhoosh!\nHe quickly kicked off the ground and dove into the nearest room.\nThud! The sound of Woo-jin’s hitting the floor echoed.\n“Oh my….”\nBaek-seo unconsciously let out a soft exclamation.\nFor a while, she couldn’t move.\nNo matter how composed Baek-seo was, it was difficult to stay calm. After all, she was just a girl who hadn’t satisfied her sexual curiosity. She could barely manage her expression.\n“……”\nBaek-seo covered her mouth.\nIronically, the sight of Woo-jin’s naked body blew away Baek-seo’s worries and occupied her mind.\n***\n“Kim Dalbi left a letter stating that ‘one of the Six Sinners is hiding in Ahsung High School as a student’…. Is that right?”\nAhn Woo-jin and Oh Baek-seo, both wearing aprons, were preparing the groceries they had bought together. Woo-jin summarized Baek-seo’s conversation.\nIn truth, it was more a recount than a summary.\nBaek-seo nodded.\n“And the letter burned up.”\nWoo-jin believed the information was true.\n‘So the Six Sinner appearing next… wasn’t about breaking through Ahsung High School’s security, but being a student from the start?’\nIt was a hypothesis he had considered before, but without clues, he couldn’t be sure.\nThanks to Dalbi’s letter, that hypothesis gained weight.\n‘Although there’s no confirmation yet, it seems reasonable to consider that possibility seriously. …I’ll have to find the suspect during the practical evaluation.’\nThe Six Sinner would likely appear during the practical evaluation.\nHowever, he wouldn’t cancel the evaluation. There was no telling when or how the Six Sinner would strike again if not then. The risk would increase absurdly.\nTherefore, it would be best to identify and capture the suspect during the evaluation. Catching them before then would be ideal.\n‘But….’\nWoo-jin looked at Baek-seo.\n“Why did you go alone?”\nHe couldn’t understand.\nDespite sensing Dalbi’s presence, she went alone without informing him.\n“It was too dangerous.”\n“She seemed to have something to say. She released a presence only I could sense. If I had brought the Leader, Dalbi might have fled immediately.”\n“Why did she call only you?”\n“I don’t know.”\n“……”\nWoo-jin thought it was because Dalbi felt uncomfortable meeting him.\nBut more importantly.\n“Baek-seo.”\n“Yes?”\nWoo-jin approached Baek-seo.\nThere was a height difference. The top of Baek-seo’s head barely reached Woo-jin’s lips, so he looked down at her.\nBaek-seo silently looked up at Woo-jin. The air grew heavy. Her usual gentle smile was not present.\n‘I know she’s more competent than I am… but this was too much. It was clearly a suspicious situation.’\nIt seemed Baek-seo was worried about Woo-jin and went to meet Dalbi alone. Ever since the confrontation with Dalbi two weeks ago, Baek-seo had been sticking close, worried about him.\nHowever, Woo-jin couldn’t respect that sentiment. He decided he needed to scold Baek-seo as a Leader because she showed a tendency not to rely on him or the Disciplinary Committee.\nIf Baek-seo had been ambushed, Woo-jin might not have realized it immediately. Just the thought of it was terrifying.\nMoreover, the opponent was the formidable Kim Dalbi.\nIt was extremely dangerous.\nThus, unless there was an unavoidable reason, Woo-jin felt it necessary to scold Baek-seo for not relying on the Disciplinary Committee.\n“You should have called the Disciplinary Committee or told me so we could plan a strategy. If you went alone and the enemies had been lying in ambush….”\n“……!”\n“”\nAs Woo-jin approached to scold her, Baek-seo stepped back.\n‘What?’\nWoo-jin was confused.\nAs he stepped closer, Baek-seo stepped back further.\n“I’m sorry for misjudging and letting her go. I’ll reflect on it.”\n“But why are you avoiding me?”\n“I don’t know.”\nDespite the serious conversation, Baek-seo couldn’t calm herself as Woo-jin drew closer.\nHer attention was focused on the sensation of Woo-jin’s skin.\nThe human brain works in fascinating ways. The memory of seeing Woo-jin’s naked body was vividly stored in her mind, making Woo-jin appear naked in her mind’s eye.\nA sexy man was approaching.\nWith such thoughts, she couldn’t focus on Woo-jin’s words.\n“Leader, I’m sorry.”\nBaek-seo managed to control her expression but couldn’t calm her thoughts.\n“You’re too close….”\nShe barely managed to express her desire for him to step back, and Woo-jin interpreted it that way.\nHowever, Baek-seo’s true intention wasn’t properly conveyed.\n‘…Could it be that she’s distancing herself because I scolded her?’\nOr is there an unspeakable reason?\nVarious worries sprouted in Woo-jin’s mind.\nHe couldn’t let the situation pass like this.\nWoo-jin decided not to comply with Baek-seo’s request to distance himself.\n“Baek-seo.”\nWoo-jin grabbed her shoulders to prevent her from running away.\nBaek-seo flinched.\nStaring into her eyes, Woo-jin saw her struggling to keep a smile while blushing.\nWoo-jin spoke in a serious tone.\n“If there’s something uncomfortable, tell me.”\nThis physical contact is uncomfortable.\n“Honestly, did something happen?”\nI saw your naked body and everything.\n“…Woo-jin?”\nFinally, Baek-seo addressed him by his name instead of ‘Leader,’ a clear sign of pressure.\nBaek-seo began to smile gently, but her voice trembled.\n“I feel embarrassed today. Could you give me some space?”\n“…….”\n“…….”\n“…Ah.”\nAfter Baek-seo confessed her honest feelings, Woo-jin understood the situation.\nThe heavy atmosphere became awkward.\nAfter that, they pretended to have a natural conversation while eating curry together.\n“Goodnight.”\n“Goodnight….”\nAfter Baek-seo left, Woo-jin stood at the entrance.\n‘My presence….’\nIt had lessened.\n“Ugh….”\nFeelings of shame and doubt swept over him sequentially.\nWoo-jin felt heat rise in his head, covered his face with his hands, and sighed.",

      "content": "Chapter 36- Rule 17. The Leader is Not Misunderstood\nPark Minhyuk, the secretary of the Ahsung High School Disciplinary Committee, had a secret hobby.\nOn the weekend, Minhyuk entered a figure store with a large bag, wearing a hood and round glasses, a smile spreading across his face as if he had entered paradise.\nMinhyuk’s steps halted in front of a limited-edition figure. The box shone brilliantly in his eyes: ‘Iron-blooded Girl Marina Silver Armor Second Version…!’\nMinhyuk quietly breathed in excitement as he purchased the figure.\nUp until the beginning of this year, Minhyuk wasn’t obsessed with figures. He had focused on romantic feelings toward real women.\nHowever, unfortunately, Minhyuk’s romantic feelings always ended in despair.\n─ ‘Sorry. Honestly… you’re not my type.’\n─ ‘Just so you know, there’s a rumor you’re creepy.’\n─ ‘Did you really think I was that easy…?’\n─ ‘I didn’t think of you that way. I just saw you as a friend…. Can we just stay friends? I’m sorry.’\n─ ‘Oh, Minhyuk…. Why would you confess to Nayeon? Who’s going to announce it now?’\nMinhyuk had an exceptionally good memory. The rejections from his confessions accumulated clearly in his mind, causing his head to hang lower and lower.\nOften, he would kick his blanket in self-loathing as he lay in bed.\nHe wanted to hide in a hole to escape the memories. Eventually, Minhyuk resorted to hiding in cabinets or trash cans to feel some relief from the world.\nOne day, Minhyuk had a realization: Was there any need to crave love from people who would just avoid him?\nThat’s when he noticed 2D characters.\nIdeal beings that wouldn’t plunge him into self-loathing. From then on, the anime character he enjoyed watching, Iron-blooded Girl Marina, started to look different to him.\nIt was the beginning of his ‘otaku’ journey.\nIn other words, the start of ‘love.’\nMinhyuk carried the bag with the figure box clutched to his chest. He left the store, his eyes scanning his surroundings cautiously.\nThere was no one suspicious.\n‘Never again will I go through what happened last time,’ he thought.\nMinhyuk repeated to himself like a mantra.\nThe day he was kidnapped by Anomia, he lost his limited-edition figure of Iron-blooded Girl Marina. Naturally, the experience stayed in his mind like a trauma.\nThe sale period was over, and only second-hand figures with other people’s fingerprints appeared on online marketplaces. Minhyuk eventually gave up on that figure.\nThus, Minhyuk made a resolution.\n‘I will never lose Marina-chan, no matter what!’\nMinhyuk moved forward cautiously, maintaining a state of extreme vigilance and even controlling his breathing.\nBut anxiety soon became reality.\nSuddenly, a hand reached out from an alley and grabbed Minhyuk.\n“Huh!”\nLike a fish caught on a hook, the weak Minhyuk was dragged away. His heart sank.\nThe person pulling him was a mysterious woman wearing sunglasses and a mask.\nClearly suspicious.\n“N-no…!”\nMinhyuk’s voice trembled.\nWere the heavens refusing to let him have Iron-blooded Girl Marina?\nRemembering his previous attack, Minhyuk thought.\nThe woman before him was undoubtedly a villain targeting him.\n“P-please spare me…!”\nMinhyuk trembled like a cornered deer.\nBut he had to protect what mattered.\nCurling up, Minhyuk clutched his bag.\n“Just kill me if you want…! But please, just let Marina-chan go home!”\n“Minhyuk, it’s me.”\n“…?”\nThe woman took off her sunglasses and mask, revealing her face.\n“The wild Ha Yesong appears!”\nHa Yesong, the Disciplinary Committee member in charge of regulating public morals at Ahsung High School, greeted energetically with her usual catchphrase.\n“…….”\nMinhyuk’s expression turned icy.\nAs the fear in his chest dissipated, his heart turned frigid in reaction.\nYesong grinned and placed her arm around Minhyuk’s shoulder.\n“Hey, loser Minhyuk, what were you saying about Marina-chan? What’s in that bag, huh? Minhyuk-kun?”\n“I’ll kill you.”\n“Haha!”\nYesong burst into laughter.\n“I don’t care about your privacy~. I’m not interested in the slightest, got it?”\n“To trample on my innocent heart…, unforgivable….”\nTears welled up in Minhyuk’s eyes.\nHis fragile heart had already been shredded.\n“Anyway, is that why you didn’t check your messages?”\n“Messages?”\n“There’s a very important issue right now!”\n“Nothing’s more important than me going home right now.”\n“Just come with me.”\nMinhyuk, being weak, had no choice.\nYesong sniffed the air and poked her head out of the alley.\n“This way!”\nShe led Minhyuk somewhere.\n“Good thing you’re disguised too.”\n“What are we doing?”\n“We’re tailing someone.”\n“Ah, stalking. Do that pathetic stuff on your own, please. It’s beneath me….”\n“It looks like the Leader and Vice Leader are on a date.”\n“!”\nMinhyuk adjusted his posture and seriously followed Yesong.\n“Where? Track them by scent immediately.”\n“There they are…. Wait, am I a dog?”\nMinhyuk didn’t deny it.\nThey spotted a man and woman entering a large burger restaurant. It was Ahn Woo-jin and Oh Baek-seo, the Leader and Vice Leader of the Disciplinary Committee, respectively, both in casual clothes.\n“Let’s go.”\n“Okay.”\nYesong and Minhyuk moved stealthily like spies.\n“?”\nHowever, to passersby, they just looked like a suspicious stalker and an otaku moving together.\nThe burger restaurant was spacious, providing many blind spots to observe Woo-jin and Baek-seo secretly.\nYesong and Minhyuk ordered burger sets and sat at a distance from Woo-jin and Baek-seo, hidden by a corner.\n“Your double steak burger and teriyaki burger are ready.”\nReceiving their burger sets, Yesong and Minhyuk ate while sneakily glancing at Woo-jin and Baek-seo, peeking out from the corner.\n“A burger place, alone together on the weekend…. This smells suspicious?”\n“It’s our respected Leader’s love life. We need to verify and support it…. If they’re a couple, it’s my duty to protect their relationship….”\nYesong and Minhyuk conversed in hushed, collective soliloquy.\nAt that moment, a blonde girl with a ponytail entered the burger place.\nIt was Yoo Doha, the treasurer of the Ahsung High School Disciplinary Committee.\nShe immediately spotted the suspicious duo and approached them.\n“Hey, Ha Yesong.”\n“Welcome, Yoo Doha.”\n“Why did you call me out on a weekend afternoon? What’s this ‘urgent matter’?”\n“First, cover your face.”\n“?”",

Minhyuk gestured urgently, and Doha crouched down.\n“Lower your voice.”\nYesong said to Doha.\n“It seems the Leader and Vice Leader are on a date. You’ve heard the rumors they might be dating, right?”\n“I don’t care about that….”\n“Our goal is to gather evidence that Leader and Vice Leader are dating. Keep that in mind.”\nDoha frowned.\n“Why are we doing this troublesome thing?”\n“Because I’m in charge of regulating public morals? It’s my duty to verify if Leader and Vice Leader are dating.”\n“Then there’s no need to call me….”\n“I can’t leave Doha-chan out. This is something we all need to confirm together.”\n“You’re just doing this for fun.”\n“Yes.”\nDoha decided not to question further.\n“Hm.”\nWhether the Leader and Vice Leader were dating or not didn’t matter to her. However, since she was here, she decided to satisfy her curiosity.\nAfter all, the Leader was someone she served, so knowing wouldn’t hurt.\nDoha sat with Yesong and Minhyuk, who nibbled on fries like rabbits while intensely spying on Woo-jin and Baek-seo.\n***\nWe went to a burger place for a simple meal. But for some reason, strange stalkers began following us.\nOne of them was Ha Yesong, wearing sunglasses and a mask, and the other was Park Minhyuk, hugging a bag tightly. Yoo Doha had just joined them.\n‘What are they doing…?’\nI pretended not to notice. I didn’t want to acknowledge their presence.\n‘Are they tailing us? Suddenly?’\nI didn’t realize they were following us until we entered the burger place. But it was obvious now.\nI suddenly admired the stoic junior who always kept a close eye on Lee Se-Ah.\n‘Baek-seo must have noticed too, right?’\nIf I noticed, there was no way Baek-seo hadn’t.\nAt that moment, Baek-seo casually started speaking while sipping her drink through a straw.\n“Hey, Leader.”\n“Why?”\n“Have you heard that rumor lately?”\n“What rumor?”\nShe asked while sipping my drink.\n“The rumor that you and I are dating.”\n“Gah! Cough, cough!”\nI choked on my drink and coughed repeatedly.\nA rumor that we’re dating?\n“Are you okay?”\n“Ah, I just swallowed wrong.”\nIt didn’t seem like a joke.\n‘How did I not know?’\nMaybe I’ve been too busy lately.\nBaek-seo rested her chin on her hand and smiled warmly.\n“…Really?”\nI asked to confirm.\n“Yes. I heard that there’s a rumor going around the Disciplinary Committee. I don’t really mind.”\n“But I do….”\nYou might not care about your reputation, but I do.\n‘So those guys…?’\nI finally understood.\n‘They came to confirm if Baek-seo and I are dating?’\nThey must be serious about it if they’re tailing us.\nTheir initiative is impressive.\nBut still.\n‘This is a mistake.’\nIt’s a perfectly reasonable rumor.\nRecently, since Baek-seo has been living next door and we’ve been commuting together, it’s only natural for such a rumor to spread.\nHigh school students tend to get excited and start rumors whenever boys and girls interact even a little.\nEspecially in Ahsung High School, where campus romances are strictly prohibited, such gossip becomes even more exciting.\n‘I should have been more careful.’\nI was concerned about this.\nBut it was hard to distance myself from Baek-seo, who worried about my safety and insisted on commuting together. Not that I wanted to, either.\nHowever, it seems I need to be more cautious from now on.\nAs the Leader, I need to strictly adhere to the school rules.\n‘For now, it’s best to make those guys believe that Baek-seo and I are just friends and not a couple.’\nLet’s pretend not to know that they’re here. They’re clearly trying not to be noticed.\nRight now, it’s time to talk to Baek-seo.\n“Baek-seo.”\n“Yes?”\n“It’s disgraceful for rumors to spread that the Leader and Vice Leader might be breaking the school rules. We should always be seen as exemplary, strictly adhering to the rules. So, let’s be careful for a while….”\nJust as I was about to speak firmly, Baek-seo interrupted.\n“Leader, wait.”\n“Huh?”\nBaek-seo picked up a napkin and leaned towards me, wiping my mouth.\n“You had ketchup on your face.”\n“Ah, thanks…. But isn’t this too close?”\nBaek-seo was leaning uncomfortably close to me.\nMoreover, even after wiping the ketchup, she didn’t move her hand away from my mouth.\n“Baek-seo? Wait, what are you…?”\nShe got even closer, almost as if she was going to kiss my cheek.\nI swallowed nervously, feeling the tension rising.\n“Leader.”\nBaek-seo’s voice suddenly filled my ear.\n“They took the bait.”\n“?”\nBaek-seo smiled sweetly.\nTwo figures quickly approached us.\nWhoosh! One of them threw off their sunglasses and mask.\n“I got it! I captured the moment they were about to kiss!”\nHa Yesong. She pointed at us proudly like a reporter who had caught a scoop. Next to her, Minhyuk, wearing round glasses, pointed at us with a surprised expression.\nBaek-seo and I turned our gazes towards them.\n“You guys…?”\n“Hi?”\nBaek-seo greeted naturally.\n“Baek-seo, so you and the Leader are really…?”\n“Leader, are you really in that kind of relationship with the Vice Leader…?”\nAt that moment, Baek-seo showed Yesong and Minhyuk her smartphone screen, displaying footage of them approaching.\n“Ah.”\nInstantly, Yesong and Minhyuk froze like ice.\nBaek-seo’s smartphone displayed footage of Yesong and Minhyuk approaching from the street.\n“A trap?”\nYesong asked, and Baek-seo nodded. Just then, Doha approached Yesong and Minhyuk from behind.\nBaek-seo put her phone back in her pocket and sat down again.\nHad she planned to tease them from the start?\n“The Leader and I were meeting for work. The rumors are false, so don’t misunderstand.”\nBaek-seo said with her usual gentle smile, voicing what I had wanted to say.\nYeah, this is better.\nI guess I was being overly cautious.\nAnyway, the matter was resolved.\n“Really…? If Baek-seo says so, then it must be true….”\nYesong and Minhyuk looked disappointed, let down by the anti-climactic turn of events.\nThey exchanged glances with Doha, and then Yesong asked me.\n“What should we do now, Leader?”\n“Why are you asking me?”\nAfter reprimanding them for tailing us for a while.\nWe decided to have fun at a karaoke.\nSince we had already met up, we agreed to go to a karaoke and have some fun.\nIt turned out to be quite enjoyable.\n***\nA female student in an Ahsung High School uniform was training in a dark room. She wore a Disciplinary Committee armband on her arm.\nThe screams of the undead echoed around her. The girl, with an emotionless expression, watched her minions fight.\nHer expressionless demeanor was something the Ahsung High School Disciplinary Committee Leader highly valued.\nEventually, the girl raised her arm and snapped her fingers.\nSnap!\nWith a sharp sound, the undead vanished into the shadows, sinking into the ground.\nOnly the traces of giant claws scratching the training dummy, walls, and floor remained.\nSimilar claw marks would be left during the Ahsung High School practical evaluation as well.\n“…Useful.”\nIn a monotonous voice, the expressionless girl turned and left the room.",

      "content": "Chapter 37- Rule 18. The Leader Thwarts the Villain’s Plan (1)\nThe Disciplinary Committee, a large force which plays a crucial role in ensuring student safety during important exams, including practical evaluations. They step in as supervisors when teacher resources are insufficient.\nThe practical evaluation was only a week away, and I awaited approval of the final proposal outlining the Disciplinary Committee’s supervision plan. It focused on the deployment specifics: when, where, and how to position committee members.\n‘I must carefully consider placement, considering the possibility that one of the Six Sinners is among our students….’\nIt wasn’t a matter to be taken lightly.\nWe didn’t know exactly when the Six Sinners would appear.\n‘…The Necromancer.’\nIn the game, the Six Sinner who attacked Ahsung High School was known as ‘The Necromancer.’\nThey concealed their identity behind a skull mask, rendering identification impossible.\nWhy would they choose the practical evaluation to cause trouble? …I don’t know.\nUnderstanding their motive beforehand would be ideal, but it was difficult to figure out.\n‘Anyway, in the game, Ahsung High School failed to apprehend them. We cannot allow that to happen.\nThe Disciplinary Committee cannot afford failure. The Necromancer’s attack led to the impeachment of the Disciplinary Committee Leader at Ahsung High School.\nI had to be extra vigilant.\nThe practical evaluation takes place over a wide area and is conducted by grade over four days.\nThe practical evaluation spans a large area and spans four days, organized by grade. Second-year students oversee first-year evaluations, third-year students monitor second-year evaluations, and fourth-year students supervise third-year evaluations. The remaining staff oversee the fourth-year evaluations.\n‘It would be easier to handle if we knew which grade’s evaluation they would target….’\nBut we couldn’t know.\nWe also couldn’t just deploy strong members for the entire evaluation.\nThe practical evaluation lasts a long time. They’re only human, so fatigue would set in, and the Necromancer, intending to attack Ahsung High School, wouldn’t overlook any suspicious circumstances.\n‘We also need to be prepared for necromancy.’\nThe Necromancer specializes in controlling undead minions, making them formidable in large-scale battles.\nTherefore, we must prepare countermeasures against necromancy discreetly, avoiding any alarm among the students.\nFirst, let’s review the suspects….’\nAlone, I reviewed the documents—a list of students with high magical power based on school measurements.\nThe criterion was ‘power levels that wouldn’t be strange for a 5th Tier or higher.’\nThe Six Sinners are inherently powerful. While the Necromancer is among the weaker ones, they still rank as a top-tier 5th Tier fighter, indicating significant magical prowess. Under optimal conditions, they could rival even a 6th Tier.\n‘There are about 50 suspects.’\nAhsung High School is one of the major academies, so it attracts many geniuses above the 5th Tier. However, the number itself wasn’t very high, narrowing down the candidates to 50.\nAmong them, the Disciplinary Committee accounted for the highest proportion, comprising 28 members.\nThis underscores the Disciplinary Committee’s esteemed status, leading in combat prowess. However, it also highlights that even the Committee cannot be fully trusted.\n‘It would be good if we could confirm their unique abilities….’\nIdentifying the suspects’ unique abilities is difficult unless the individuals willingly disclose them. There is a prevalent culture of treating unique abilities as sensitive private matters, and many people hide or lie about them to protect themselves.\nGiven that very few people manifest unique abilities, the uncertainty about how such rare powers might be used, and the potential risk of being targeted by criminals, this is a complex social phenomenon.\nSo, those whose unique abilities were clear and unrelated to necromancy were excluded from suspicion.\n‘I’m not sure about the physique….’\nThe Necromancer always wore a hooded robe, so their physique was unknown. At least they weren’t tall, so students with large builds were excluded from suspicion.\nKnock, knock.\nJust then, a knock sounded on the door of the Disciplinary Committee’s executive office.\n“Come in.”\nI was the only one in the office.\nI raised my voice.\nThe door opened, and our top-tier expressionless talent walked in. The emotionless junior.\nShe saluted and stood at ease in front of my desk.\n“Good work, Leader.”\nHer tone was flat and emotionless.\nI looked away from her and resumed reviewing the documents that needed approval.\n“Report.”\nThe intensity of her surveillance on Lee Se-Ah had decreased compared to before. Now, it was more about casually observing her and reporting back.\nAlthough Lee Se-Ah had realized she was being watched, it wasn’t possible to stop surveillance completely.\nAdditionally, the reason for receiving verbal reports was to avoid leaving records.\n“No special incidents. Lee Se-Ah is still leading her group and focusing on good deeds. It’s the same as usual.”\n“Alright. Thanks for your effort.”\nNormally, the reports ended like this.\nThe reduced intensity of her mission was a factor, but the main reason was that Lee Se-Ah hadn’t made any significant moves in school.\nHowever, no matter how cautious Lee Se-Ah was, she would inevitably make significant moves by next semester. This was when she would become the leader of the Do-hwa Group and the ruler of the black market, which happened in the second semester of this year. It was also when she would die.\n…Besides that.\n“I’ll take my leave now….”\n“Han Seo-jin.”\n“Yes.”\nThe emotionless junior, Han Seo-jin, responded calmly without any special reaction.\n“How is your work with the Disciplinary Committee going? Have you adapted yet?”\nSeo-jin was listed among the suspects.\nUpon further investigation, it turned out her magic power was higher than expected. She lived up to the potential I saw in her.\nSo, she naturally caught my attention. She was one of the top suspects, the so-called ‘Number 1 Suspect.’\nTop suspects would be monitored closely by the strongest members of the Disciplinary Committee, like me, Oh Baek-seo, and Ha Yesong.\nAmong them, I decided to personally keep an eye on the expressionless junior since she was the talent I had noticed.\nToday was also the last report day before the practical evaluation, so I decided to have a brief conversation.\n“……”\nMaybe because I attempted to initiate a conversation, which was unusual.\nSeo-jin looked at me silently, trying to gauge my intentions before speaking.\n“…There are still many areas I need to improve, but I’ve adapted to most tasks. Thanks to the excellent guidance from the seniors.”\n“That’s good.”\nI looked up from the documents and met Seo-jin’s eyes.\n“Come to think of it, you said your reason for joining the Disciplinary Committee was to uphold order, right?”\n“Yes.”\nAs expected.\nEven though she had mentioned such a pretentious and embarrassing reason for joining, Seo-jin’s expression didn’t change at all.\n“Is there anything else you’d like to do in the future?”\n“…I’m not sure I understand.”\n“I meant exactly what I said. You don’t strike me as particularly honest.”\n“……”\nSeo-jin remained silent, not answering. Maybe my words hit the mark.\n“Starting with your reason for joining. If you were sincere, I apologize.”\n“…Actually, I joined to build my resume. I thought I needed to show enthusiasm during the interview, so I said those things. I’m sorry if I disappointed you….”\n“I didn’t say that to hear an apology. Everyone’s the same. Including me.”\n“Yes?”\nI leaned back in my chair.",

In other words, my goal is also to build my resume. Most people are like you and me.”\n“…I see.”\n“That’s what I want. To get a good position and live well. Do you have something like that?”\nSeo-jin looked down and thought for a moment before speaking.\n“…I want to see the ocean.”\n“The ocean?”\n“That’s the only thing that comes to mind.”\nThe ocean….\nFor a moment, her expressionless face seemed to crack slightly. I realized this was the first time Seo-jin had given an honest answer, always hiding her emotions.\nIn my previous life and various media in this world, the vast and blue ocean beyond the sandy beach had the power to make people’s hearts flutter. It’s natural to have a longing for the sea.\nHowever, in the current era, going to the sea is forbidden.\nThere’s no safe route to the sea, to begin with.\nTo see the sea, you’d have to graduate high school, obtain an explorer’s license, and venture outside, prepared to lose your life more easily than an insect due to the dangerous monsters outside.\n“…Are you going to laugh at me?”\n“?”\nUnexpectedly, Seo-jin’s words caught me off guard.\nSeo-jin looked straight into my eyes with her emotionless face.\n“Why would I?”\n“Because it’s nonsense. Everyone knows it’s dangerous, and I want to see a sea that’s no longer beautiful.”\nWas she saying her desire was worthless?\nI recalled the images of the sea brought back by explorers.\nThe sea’s landscape had changed so much that one wouldn’t necessarily want to see it anymore.\nBut.\n“Nonsense? I think it’s cool.”\n“Yes?”\nI couldn’t understand why Seo-jin felt cynical about her own aspirations.\n“Nature always cycles. By now, some parts of the ocean might have regained their old beauty. A lot of time has passed since ‘The Hole’ closed.”\nThe Hole.\nA massive gate that once appeared in the Pacific Ocean.\nThe Hole unleashed countless monsters, beginning with the Tier 9 Golden Sheep, causing widespread chaos.\nNow, the Golden Sheep had closed it.\n“In that case, you might be the one to find that beautiful sea.”\n“……?”\n“Having such a wish, I think that’s cool.”\nIt was my genuine feeling.\nSuch desires are what drive progress in the world.\nSeo-jin blinked slowly, her expression remaining impassive.\n“I see. Thank you,” Seo-jin replied, inclining her head in acknowledgement.\nThere wasn’t much else to discuss.\nI couldn’t just ask, ‘Are you one of the Six Sinners?’\nHan Seo-jin was a talent I acknowledged.\nA promising prospect.\nI just hoped she wouldn’t turn out to be the Necromancer and end up fighting against me.\n“You can go now.”\n“Yes. Goodbye, Leader.”\nSeo-jin saluted and left the office.\n***\nWalking down the corridor after leaving the office, Han Seo-jin thought.\nSeo-jin planned to release the undead and complete her mission during the practical evaluation before leaving Ahsung High School. However, she encountered an unexpected variable after enrolling at Ahsung High School.\nThe Disciplinary Committee Leader.\nWhen she was assigned the infiltration mission at Ahsung High School by the Head Principal, the Disciplinary Committee Leader wasn’t considered a key figure.\nSeo-jin didn’t think much of the Leader’s solo resolution of the Anomia train terror incident either.\nHowever, after joining the Disciplinary Committee as part of her plan, Seo-jin was surprised by the Leader.\n─ ‘So, you want me to keep an eye on Lee Se-Ah?’\nThe Leader had assigned Seo-jin to monitor Lee Se-Ah.\nSeo-jin felt uneasy and tense.\nWhy her, of all people?\nCould it be that she had aroused suspicion?\nSeo-jin recalled asking the Leader why she was given a personal assignment.\n─ ‘Because you’re in the same class as Lee Se-Ah in the first year at Maehwa Hall. You just stood out the most.’\nIt was a flimsy reason.\nA vague response that couldn’t be disputed.\nAt that time, Seo-jin secretly used one of her necromantic abilities.\nThe derived ability of the ‘Sixth Sense.’\nThe sense to discern whether someone is telling the truth or lying.\nAnd she found out.\n‘It was a lie.’\nSeo-jin determined that the reason given by the Leader was a lie.\nThere was undoubtedly a hidden agenda behind the Leader’s actions.\n‘They must have noticed something suspicious about me.’\nThe Leader was rumored to know a lot about Anomia.\nSeo-jin had dismissed these as mere rumors, but being personally called and assigned a task with a lie made her suspicious.\n─ ‘Thank you for trusting me, Leader. I will deliver the best results.’\nThus, Seo-jin did her best to avoid the Leader’s suspicion, diligently performing her tasks and going above and beyond what was asked.\nIt was an act to show her dedication as a new member of the Disciplinary Committee.\nAlthough the intensity of the surveillance on Lee Se-Ah had lessened, Seo-jin couldn’t afford to be careless.\n‘There must be no setbacks in the plan. If the Leader shows signs of suspicion during the practical evaluation….’\nThen there was no other choice.\nShe would have to deal with the Leader first.\nAs she walked, Seo-jin stopped and looked out the window. The outdoor swimming pool used for swimming classes came into view.\n─ ‘I think it’s cool to have such a wish.’\n“…….”\nThe Leader’s words echoed in her mind.\nUsing her ability, she confirmed that his words were sincere.\nShe thought back.\nWhenever she expressed her desire to see the ocean, others’ responses were always filled with insincere platitudes.\nThey treated her like a dreamer trapped in her own world or a foolish person chasing meaningless dreams.\nThe only person who hadn’t laughed at her desire was the Head Principal.\nHowever, she never expected to hear such genuine admiration.\nSeo-jin lowered her gaze and whispered to herself.\n“He’s a kind person….”\nAfter pondering the Leader’s words for a while, Seo-jin resumed walking.\n***\nTime passed, and the practical evaluation began.",

      "content": "Chapter 38 – Rule 18. The Leader Thwarts the Villain’s Plan (2)\nRecalling the details of the game was no easy task.\nEspecially since the attack on Ahsung High School by the Six Sinners wasn’t linked to any storyline or event.\nI could only barely remember what the in-game news anchor had said.\nSo, I considered it remarkable that I remembered the incident would happen at all.\n‘I feel uneasy…’\nThe growing tension was inevitable.\nIt wasn’t that I knew nothing; rather, it was because I had such incomplete knowledge of future events.\nI just hoped everything would go smoothly…\n‘Did that guy know the practical evaluation would take place here?’\nI was talking about the necromancer.\nEven I didn’t know where Ahsung High School’s practical evaluation would take place this semester in advance.\nThe evaluation proposal I approved only described the structure and features of the location.\nAs the Disciplinary Committee Leader, I too had to participate in the practical evaluation, so only minimal information was provided to ensure fairness.\nIt was only today that the students were informed of the location and method of the practical evaluation. It was even a newly developed area this year.\nBeing a supervisor as part of the Disciplinary Committee didn’t grant me any significant advantage in the test site.\nThe evaluation mainly focused on assessing magical control abilities. After each evaluation, the targets would automatically move for the next evaluation, and it could be practiced at the academy as well.\n‘The necromancer plans to attack at a site even I couldn’t know….’\nWhy?\nThere were two main possibilities.\nEither the necromancer didn’t care about the location for attacking Ahsung High School.\nOr she had some sort of connection with a staff member who could leak the information.\nAssuming the latter, it was hard to trust anyone. So, I only shared the information that the Six Sinners might appear during the practical evaluation with the committee members. Although it sounded like my baseless speculation, everyone thought there was no harm in being cautious.\n‘Please… let them get caught without any incident.’\nThe responsibility of capturing the Six Sinners while ensuring the safety of the students weighed heavily on my heart. It must be the sense of responsibility.\nEven knowing this practical evaluation was a chance to capture the necromancer, I couldn’t easily dismiss these emotions.\nKnowing game knowledge had its problems.\n“Leader.”\nAt that moment, Vice Leader Oh Baek-seo approached me.\n“Are you nervous?”\n“!”\nNo way.\nHad she read my mind again?\n“No, no way. A Disciplinary Committee Leader being nervous about catching a villain would be absurd.”\n“Yes, it would be.”\nFeigning indifference, Baek-seo nodded with a gentle smile.\n“After all, Kim Dalbi might have been lying. Even if she was telling the truth, the practical evaluation could go smoothly.”\n“I hope she’s lying. I hope nothing happens.”\nThe night sky, studded with stars like salt sprinkled over a high navy blue sky, was serene.\nWe gazed at the test site together.\nIt was a practical evaluation location quite far from Ahsung High School.\nA massive test site constructed by modifying a forest, filled with artificial structures.\nIt was developed by the entire Ahsung Academy, known as the ‘Ahsung Comprehensive Academy,’ and boasted a maze-like complex structure.\n‘Building something like that for educational purposes…’\nMajor academies sure knew how to go big.\nAnyway, today was the practical evaluation day for first-year students.\nThe second-year Disciplinary Committee members were assigned as supervisors.\nMeanwhile, the highly skilled committee members (except Park Minhyuk) were decided to supervise on different days regardless of their grade. I volunteered to take on multiple days as a supervisor.\nHowever, Oh Baek-seo insisted on following me. She said she would work with me on all the days I participated as a test supervisor.\nShe claimed she couldn’t let the leader bear the burden alone as the vice leader.\nGiven the possibility of a villain among the students, she argued that safety was paramount, leaving me with no grounds to refuse.\n‘Having Baek-seo help is a relief.’\nHaving someone like Baek-seo with me was reassuring.\nShe was quite dependable.\n“It looks like it’s about to start.”\nFirst-year students, lined up in groups at the plaza, began moving towards the test site under the supervisors’ guidance.\nThey would enter the test site from different locations to take the practical evaluation.\n“It’s time to part ways. Leader, be careful.”\n“You too. Take care.”\n“Yes.”\nWe separated.\nWe had agreed to tail our primary suspects among the first-year students, believed to be the necromancer, each taking a different target. Naturally, as supervisors.\nThe primary suspect I focused on was the expressionless junior, Han Seo-jin.\nBut I couldn’t just watch her alone.\nWith multiple suspects, I had to keep track of everyone’s positions.\nThe practical evaluation participants wore bracelets.\nThese bracelets could be tracked via a smartphone app.\nSo, I planned to monitor the suspects from a distance.\n‘Expressionless… I hope it’s not you.’\nI sincerely hoped that the promising student I had somewhat grown fond of wasn’t the villain.\n* * *",

In the movie, the male and female leads leaned on each other’s shoulders, deepening their love as they watched the setting sun.\nIt was truly beautiful.\nThat’s why, in her childhood, the sea was deeply imprinted in Han Seo-jin’s memory.\nBefore billions of old humanity lost their lives, the sea was a symbol of romance. Many modern media still strive to recreate the beautiful seas of the past.\nHowever, everyone knew what the sea was like now.\nPhotos of the sea, taken at great risk by an explorer in the past, were circulating on the internet.\nWhat was once a symbol of romance had become a hellish sight.\nEven so, Seo-jin longed to see the sea.\nShe wanted to capture even a fragment of that beautiful scenery with her own eyes.\nEven if it was just a minor whim, Seo-jin desperately wanted it.\n“……”\nAt the practical evaluation site.\nFireflies and lanterns hanging from trees illuminated the surroundings.\nUnlike the other students diligently taking their practical evaluations, Seo-jin sat motionless on an artificial structure, bathed in moonlight.\nShe had no interest in the various structures designed to test magic manipulation, the targets meant to measure magic responsiveness and detection abilities.\nShe had a different task at hand than taking the practical evaluation.\nRaising her head, she could see a skyscraper stretching towards the sky in the distance, like a Babel tower. Bright light emanated from its peak.\nIt was the center of Academy City.\nA beacon indicating the ‘central point.’\nThe Head Principal of Academy City was in that building.\n─ ‘Child.’\nThe Head Principal’s voice echoed in Seo-jin’s mind, a lingering memory from the past.\nIn her childhood.\nWhen many children in their infancy were being disposed of under the Head Principal’s supervision, Seo-jin alone barely survived.\nThe Head Principal had said to Seo-jin,\n─ ‘I will show you the beautiful sea you long for.’\nThose words had momentarily brought a sparkle to Seo-jin’s eyes.\n─ ‘So, for the future of all, will you lend me your strength?’\nThe Head Principal claimed to know a safe route to the sea outside the city.\nSo Seo-jin might actually see the sea she had seen in the movies, bathed in the light of a setting sun.\nThat was enough.\nThe mere hope and expectation of seeing the sea allowed Seo-jin to keep going.\nWithout it, she would have followed the same fate as the disposed children.\n“…Let’s begin.”\nSeo-jin mimicked grabbing something.\nSsss.\nA purple aura materialized in her hand, transforming into a black skull mask. She placed the mask on her face.\nAs she stood up, her body was enveloped in the aura, which soon took the shape of a robe.\nThe iconic skull mask and robe of the Six Sinners’ ‘Necromancer.’\nThe magical attire, which could be stored in magical form and materialized or dematerialized at any time.\nSuddenly, a purple magic circle appeared on the ground, and a staff rose from it. This was also part of the materialization process.\nSeo-jin grasped the staff.\nIt was a magical staff embedded with a magic stone.\nIt made magic manipulation and output much easier.\nHolding the staff, Seo-jin channeled her magic.\nRumble!\nAt that moment, accompanied by a mild earthquake, a large circle of purple magic began to form in the center of the test site.\nWhoooosh!\nFollowing the circle, an alien purple water current rose, forming a circular space.\nSoon, a massive barrier formed around Seo-jin.\nThe barrier, with its gently undulating waves, enclosed a part of the large test site, isolating the space.\nHer unique power, ‘Necromancy.’\nMagic formula Type 4, ‘Soul Domain.’\nSeo-jin had previously obtained information about this test site.\nTo efficiently and powerfully use her unique ability.\n“What the…!?”\n“What is that…?”\n“Isn’t that a barrier…?”\n“Ahhh!”\nAmid the students’ confusion, the inner wall of the Soul Domain revealed a new sky. The test site seemed to brighten as if it had been transported to another world.\nIt was due to the mysterious illusion of a moon bleeding and emitting a soft light.\nWhoosh. Seo-jin lightly swung her staff.\nIn response, the summoning magic circles engraved throughout the test site began to glow and simultaneously started spewing out the undead.\n“What is that!?”\n“Run!”\n“Crazy!”\nStudents screamed and either fled or took combat stances.\nThe summoned beings were undead.\nOr more precisely,\n[Groooar…!]\nthey were the dead beasts.\nThe skeletal beasts, wrapped in magic like a second skin, raised their massive bodies. Their sharp claws reflected the magic as they gleamed.",

However, most could not, and thus they vividly felt the terror conveyed by verified threats.\n“Aah…”\nA male student’s legs gave out, causing him to fall to the ground.\nHis entire body trembled.\nThe emotion reflected on his face was fear.\nIt emerged instinctively, imprinted into his very being, regardless of his will.\nA skeletal beast, its bones imbued with eerie magical power, charged at him. It was the terror of human history.\nThe student couldn’t muster the courage to fight back. The amount of magic he sensed already far surpassed his level.\nOther students were in similar predicaments.\nRunning away.\nPanicking.\nGiving up and awaiting death.\nThey were busy being terrified at the sight of the beasts.\nThe unique ability, necromancy.\nMagic Formula Type 1, ‘Summon the Dead.’\nThis magic formula, using the passive skill ‘Sixth Sense’ from the unique ability, communicated with and summoned the contracted spirits.\nThe summoned spirits couldn’t handle magic due to the lack of magic circuits in their bodies.\nIn other words, the corpses of magical beasts, whose skeletons were more robust than humans, were perfect minions.\nThus, the necromancer had made many contracts at the magical beasts’ graveyard, guided by the Head Principal.\nMost magical beasts did not communicate and followed only their instincts. As long as they could move again and crave flesh, they didn’t mind living as skeletons.\nHence, the army of the dead that appeared at the practical evaluation site was entirely composed of magical beasts.\nWhirr.\nClick, click.\nSensing the crisis, the security robots assigned as exam supervisors transformed into combat mode. The lamps that once shone now gleamed with a determined light.\nThese were AI robots managing the overall infrastructure of Academy City.\nThey had no biological sense of fear.\n[Groar!]\nThe skeletal beasts, engulfed in the necromancer’s magic, charged. The security robots fought back, but some met a futile end as their metallic bodies were torn apart.\nNot all skeletal beasts possessed equal strength. They weren’t identical entities. The beasts that the security robots couldn’t handle targeted the students.\nHowever, the security robots weren’t the only forces prepared at Ahsung High School.\nBang!\nKim Deok-soo, a member of the Disciplinary Committee, struck a magical beast with his truncheon, breaking through the magical skin covering its spine. It was a strike imbued with the elemental power of solid rock.\nHe was the committee member who, after once being involved with delivering food to the needy alongside Lee Se-Ah, shared what happened to the expressionless junior, Han Seo-jin.\nA skeletal beast attacked again, but Deok-soo repelled it with multiple consecutive swings of his truncheon.\n“Are you okay?”\nDeok-soo shouted to the student who was almost caught by the beast. The rescued student nodded, teary-eyed.\n“Th-thank you….”\n“Whew.”\nDeok-soo quickly scanned the surroundings as he gathered his truncheon.\nThe extreme tension turned into cold sweat, running down his cheeks.\nNo matter how brave he pretended to be, Deok-soo was just an ordinary person. He moved only because he was part of the Disciplinary Committee. He wanted to flee at any moment.\nBut.\n─ ‘This is a message to the Disciplinary Committee. Emergency Response Level 4 issued.\nDue to the barrier, support is limited. Everyone, prioritize protecting the students.’\nThe solemn instruction from the Disciplinary Committee Leader, delivered through the radio, crossed Deok-soo’s mind.\nLevel 4 was the highest response level.\nIt meant facing the emergency with the resolve to sacrifice lives and ensuring the students’ safety at all costs.\nOther committee members must also be exerting themselves in such a crisis, so he couldn’t afford to be ruled by fear.\nA sense of duty.\nResponsibility.\nComradeship.\nNumerous emotions suppressed his fear.\nThese were the reasons the committee members, including Deok-soo, could fight against the skeletal beasts despite their trembling bodies.\nHowever, such emotions alone didn’t translate into combat strength.\n“Over there, behind you!!”\n“!”\nThe rescued student spotted a beast stealthily approaching like an assassin and shouted urgently.",

He appeared unaffected by the terror the beasts conveyed. That cold gaze instead boosted Deok-soo’s morale.\nWoo-jin said nothing. He just lightly tapped Deok-soo’s shoulder as he passed by, as if entrusting the situation to him.\n“……”\nRemembering how close he had come to being overwhelmed by the beast, Deok-soo bit his lip.\nThe leader was tirelessly fighting to protect the students.\nHe couldn’t afford to display such ineptitude anymore.\n“Follow me! We need to evacuate!”\n“Yes, yes…!”\nDeok-soo quickly moved, leading the student he had saved.\n* * *\n‘I didn’t hear about this…!?’\nThis is a serious problem.\nThe situation was much worse than expected.\nThe sudden deployment of the barrier rendered smartphones useless and location tracking impossible. Only radio communication remained functional.\nMoreover, the barrier was significantly larger than a soccer field, with a palpable density of magic power rarely seen in Neo Seoul.\nEven Oh Baek-seo would struggle to break through it.\nFor now, the only option was to fend off the threat with available Disciplinary Committee members and security robots.\n‘Expressionless… was it really you?’\nI looked toward the center of the barrier. I had pinpointed who was there before the tracking app went offline.\nThe expressionless junior, Han Seo-jin.\nBased on the location information I saw on the app, she had remained in one place for some reason. I had been observing carefully.\nUltimately, the barrier had been deployed with Seo-jin at its center.\nThere was no doubt she was one of the Six Sinners.\n‘This is strange.’\nMy brow furrowed.\nMy mind was a chaotic mess.\n‘No matter how powerful the necromancer, they can’t create a barrier of this magnitude. How did she summon minions in multiple locations? In the game, she could only summon them around herself.’\nEven though necromancy was an exceptional unique ability, it wasn’t supposed to cause such severe balance disruption.\nThe density of magic power and the scale of the technique were at least at the 7th tier or higher.\nI didn’t understand what was happening.\nThe situation didn’t align with the game information I knew.\n‘And the magic beneath the ground…’\nWhat concerned me most was below the ground.\nI sensed an unusual magic force from below.\n‘What is this magic…?’\nSince the necromancer activated her unique ability, I had felt a heartbeat-like pulse of life.\nUnidentified magic was rising from below.\n‘It’s clear that this isn’t something Seo-jin could do alone. There’s some enormous catalyst underground. Something very dangerous…’\nWhatever the catalyst was, it clearly shouldn’t be awakened.\nSeo-jin seemed to have known what lay beneath the ground.\nA human?\nNo.\nA human couldn’t survive being buried alive.\nSomething.\nSomething beyond the 7th tier was assisting Seo-jin from beneath the ground.\nIf so, Seo-jin’s motive for committing this massacre was likely linked to what was underground.\nShe wouldn’t have gone to such lengths to prepare for a meaningless slaughter.\nThe reason she awakened the minions and targeted students must be to kill as many as quickly as possible.\nWhy?\n‘…To awaken whatever is underground? To offer human corpses or blood as a sacrifice?’\nI didn’t know the exact cause and effect, but it seemed possible.\nOtherwise, Seo-jin wouldn’t have prepared so thoroughly and carried out the slaughter here.\nI bit my lip.\nThe barrier’s area was excessively large.\nThe magical beasts’ strength varied, and the students were scattered everywhere. It was uncertain whether the security robots and the Disciplinary Committee members within the barrier could protect the students.\nWhat to do?\nHow could I protect the students and survive?\nFirst, I needed to find Han Seo-jin.\nEven though I couldn’t defeat her with my current abilities, I had to somehow stop her to end this situation.\nI didn’t know if she had moved or if she was still in her previous location.\nIn any case, I kept running towards where Seo-jin was. As fast as possible. My clothes fluttered continuously.\nBoom!!\nCrack!!\nI smashed every beast I saw with the Iron Dragon Staff.\nWhen I saw a beast in the distance, I launched the Lightning Rod, discharging lightning. Seo-jin’s minions, swept by the dozens of lightning branches, lost their magical skin and were incapacitated.\nMy heart pounded incessantly, urging me on.\nEvery time I took down a beast, somewhere else, another attack was happening.\nAt this moment, someone might have already fallen.\n‘Just a little… faster!’\nFaster.\nFaster.\nI channeled magic power to its maximum output for physical enhancement and shot through the test site like an arrow. Tension gripped my entire body. My teeth clenched.\nSuddenly, I spotted another beast.\nAnd.\n“…Ah!”\nThe beast’s sharp claws raked a female student’s side.\nHer eyes widened, her breath caught, and my heart sank.\nThe student, clutching her side, stumbled back. Blood gushed through her fingers, soaking her uniform.\nShe collapsed backward.\nI recognized her face.\n─ ‘You’ll get better with practice. Keep it up.’\n─ ‘Leader, I’ll do my best…!’\nShe was a new Disciplinary Committee member I had advised while monitoring hair and dress code at the school gate.\nShe didn’t wear her committee armband since she was here for the practical evaluation as a first-year student.\nMeanwhile, a security robot, possibly protecting her, struggled to fight the beast, half its body blown away, sparking and smoking.\nThe beast casually swiped its claws, finishing off the robot. Its lamp extinguished, and the mechanical hum ceased.\nWhoosh!\nI charged forward.\nComplicated thoughts didn’t enter my mind.\nRight now, I only wanted to kill that huge beast.\nI infused more lightning magic into the Iron Dragon Staff. By the time the beast noticed me, my staff was already cutting through the air.\nBoom!!!\nCrack!!\n[Grr…!]\nI delivered a powerful strike. The lightning-wrapped Iron Dragon’s Staff pierced the beast’s torso, shattering it with a shockwave.\nPurple magic dispersed, and bone fragments scattered.\nThe beast’s dying scream was abruptly cut off.",

      "content": "Chapter 40 – Rule 18: The Leader Thwarts the Villain’s Plan (4)\nI think of the bold protagonists in various media.\nThose who remain resolute in critical moments and easily overcome any adversity.\nSuch characters have often influenced the persona I put on as the Disciplinary Committee Leader.\nNaturally, my true self was different.\nI was a coward.\nCrushed under the weight of my responsibilities, I was anxious every day, constantly pushing myself to fulfill my duties and achieve my goals.\nBut I don’t think that’s a bad thing.\nOn the contrary, I believe that as a coward with a facade, the fruits of my tireless efforts will eventually lead me to a happy ending.\nSo, I give my all.\nEven if thoughts of it being too late try to creep into my mind and cause self-loathing, I focus on doing what I can right now.\nI rushed to the junior whose side had been slashed by the beast’s claws.\nBending one knee, I checked on the kid.\n“Leader…”\n“Don’t talk.”\nThe junior looked at me with a pale face, struggling to catch her breath. Air whistled through her teeth. Her eyes, barely open, looked ready to close at any moment.\n‘The wound is deep.’\nInside the torn uniform, blood flowed from the side she was clutching, like water from an open faucet.\nI immediately pulled out my radio.\nWhile smartphones were useless, the radio worked fine.\n“Send a medical drone to my location immediately! Hurry!”\nI pressed down on her side to stem the blood loss, but it was far from effective.\nStill, I couldn’t give up.\nI had to minimize the bleeding until the medical drone arrived.\nThat was what I could do.\nMy breathing grew labored.\n‘Calm down, control your expression.’\nI urged myself to calm down.\nA Disciplinary Committee Leader shouldn’t show signs of panic.\n“Cough!”\nThe junior coughed up blood, but even then, she let out a hollow laugh as if something was funny.\n“Heh… Leader… it hurts…”\n“I told you not to talk.”\n“I’m fine… you don’t need to help me anymore… go help the others…”\nOthers.\nThe mention of others sent a cold sweat trickling down my face.\nIt wasn’t just this kid.\nAt this very moment, many students were being targeted by Han Seo-jin and were in mortal danger.\nIf I stayed here like this, I might miss the chance to save others.\nWas this the best choice?\nWas I acting rationally?\nMore importantly,\n‘Why… didn’t I foresee this disaster?’\nWould the situation have been better if I had been more cautious from the start?\nWould things have been different if I had been a bit wiser?\n…No.\nNow was not the time to dwell on self-reproach, regret the past, or agonize over things.\nIt was time to resolve this situation.\n“Hang in there. The drone will arrive soon and provide first aid. Just a little longer, just a little longer…”\nOrdinarily, a medical drone should have arrived instantly. It was delayed.\nIt must have gone to help other students.\nOne second passed.\nAnother second passed.\n“……”\nThe junior no longer seemed to have the strength to speak. Her eyes gradually closed.\n“Don’t close your eyes!!”\nI shouted without realizing it.\nBut the ensuing silence only emphasized the powerlessness of my words.\nThe pretense of being the Disciplinary Committee Leader no longer mattered.\nSeeing the subordinate I was responsible for closing her eyes drove my mind to the brink of despair.\nMaybe it was the sense of responsibility.\n“Leader…”\nThe junior managed to squeeze out a voice with a smile.\n“Thank you… for everything…”\n“Shut up.”\n“……”\n“……?”\nWhile I was pressing her side, her hand slipped away weakly.\nI glanced at her face. She hadn’t fully closed her lifeless eyes, just staring at the sky.\nMy breath caught. My heart felt like it was drying up rapidly, sinking into an abyss.\nMy bloodied hands remained pressed against her side to stem the bleeding.\nMy mind screamed to go help other students, but my hands wouldn’t move.\nI clung to the faint hope that I could still save her, pressing her side.\nThe medical drone would arrive soon, and all it needed was to administer first aid.\nEven if her heart had stopped, I could use my lightning magic for CPR.\nBut…\n“……”\nI couldn’t shake the thought that it was already too late.\nReality set in.\nI shouldn’t stay here like this.\nI was the Disciplinary Committee Leader.\nI had to strive for maximum efficiency in fulfilling my duties.\nThis indecision was unacceptable.\nMy entire body felt like it was freezing.\nBut slowly, I began to loosen my grip and let go of the junior.\nAt that moment,\n“It’s okay.”\nA gentle hand placed mine back on the junior’s side.\nAnother hand touched my chest as if to reassure me.\nA black-haired female student stood beside me.\nI looked at her.\nA first-year student with ruby-red eyes and a mischievous smile, gazing at my junior.\n“Lee Se-Ah…?”",

She looked around in confusion, clearly unaware of what had happened.\nI was just as dumbfounded.\n“Tada! Problem solved, just like that!”\nI felt the strength drain from me, making me want to collapse.\n“Well, maybe not ‘just like that.’ It is my unique ability.”\n“What…?”\nStill in a daze, I stared into Se-Ah’s red eyes.\n“It’s kind of private, so I can’t tell a stalker like you what it is!”\nIt wasn’t healing magic.\nWhat was it?\nTime reversal?\nCausality inversion?\nWas it some impossible ability like that?\nOr something else entirely?\nI had just learned that Se-Ah had a unique ability.\nSe-Ah placed a hand on my shoulder and smiled her usual sly smile.\n“Senior, your problem is that you try to handle everything on your own. You’ll burn out quickly that way.”\n“……”\nI had no strength to respond to Se-Ah’s playful reprimand. Then, she revealed her clear red eyes again.\n“…Your Disciplinary Committee is doing quite well. Even among my peers taking the evaluation, the committee members were bravely fighting. Maybe it’s the duty of the Disciplinary Committee? Oh, and it’s probably also thanks to you taking down so many of those nasty skeletons?”\nSe-Ah smiled mischievously.\nShe was trying to reassure me.\n“Well, our Volunteer Club is also doing its part, you know?”\nSpreading her hands to either side of her face, Se-Ah spoke in a light-hearted manner.\n“We’re all about helping those in need!”\nI could easily imagine the mischievous grins of the Volunteer Club members as they helped students.\n“…I see.”\nWhatever the case, there was no time to waste.\nI confirmed that the junior had regained consciousness and then stood up.\n“Se-Ah, thank you.”\nI left it at that for now. I’d properly thank her later.\n“You’re welcome~. Shall we get going? I think you have someone else to deal with.”\n“Please take care of this place.”\n“Sure thing.”\nWith a faint sense of relief, I gave Se-Ah a light high-five and left the area.\nI enhanced my body to its maximum capacity and dashed towards the center of the barrier, where Han Seo-jin was located.\nI wanted support from other committee members, but it was difficult with Seo-jin’s minions swarming around.\nI had to face Seo-jin alone.\nFinally,\nI reached an expansive area with ornate structures.\nWhoosh!!\n“……!”\nA mysterious, sharp wave of water surged at me like a blade.\nSensing the threat instinctively, I quickly leaped back to avoid the attack.\nThe water fell and seeped into the ground.\nAnd ahead,\nsomeone stood in front of a structure in the open space, staring straight at me.\nA skull mask.\nA black robe.\nA magic staff.\nAll appearances I had seen in the game.\n“Han Seo-jin.”\nI could hear the breath of one of the Six Sinners, Han Seo-jin.\n“Leader.”\nA mechanical voice that was neither male nor female.\nA modulated tone.\n“You knew from the beginning that I didn’t come to this academy with pure intentions.”\n…I didn’t know.\nI only realized it later.\nWhatever the misunderstanding, it didn’t matter at the moment.\n“Stop this nonsense immediately.”\nI suppressed the emotions boiling inside me to avoid getting too excited, but some still seeped into my voice.\n“Sorry, but I can’t. I have something I must achieve.”\nI pulled the brim of my cap down to hide the vein throbbing on my forehead.\nThis person was a precious junior I had cared for and seen as a promising member of the committee.\nThat’s why I felt even more furious.\n“Goddamn bastard…”\nI swore in a calm tone.\nI could interrogate Seo-jin later about why she enrolled at Ahsung High School, why she joined the Disciplinary Committee, and why she did all this.\nFor now, I had to focus on ending this situation.\nCan I capture Han Seo-jin with my abilities?\nI don’t know.\nBut whether it’s possible or not isn’t important right now.\nI needed to confront Seo-jin as soon as possible.\nAnd I wanted to.\n“I will execute immediate arrest and punish the offender severely.”\nReciting the official line of the Disciplinary Committee according to the school rules, I gathered my magic power and infused the Iron Dragon’s Staff with lightning magic at maximum output.\nSeo-jin also channeled magic into her staff. The magic stone embedded in the staff glowed with the same purple hue as Seo-jin’s eyes.\n“A filthy criminal like you deserves even harsher punishment.”\nMy muscles tensed.\nI gripped the Iron Dragon’s Staff tightly.\nI bent my knees slightly.\nLeaned my upper body forward.\nWhoosh!\nI charged at Seo-jin with all my might.",

At a young age, she realized that she was merely livestock roaming the pasture.\nIf she didn’t follow the Head Principal’s will, it was only natural that she would be disposed of. However, Seo-jin had already seen the beautiful sea on the cinema screen.\nA primal desire to see it again simply because it was pretty.\nShe found a reason to live that she had not wanted to find. And so, Seo-jin could continue to live, even in this city.\n***\nCrackle!!!\nAhn Woo-jin, the Disciplinary Committee Leader, unleashed his power.\nThe shockwaves of turquoise electricity burst incessantly, and the Iron Dragon Staff moved with precision, targeting Seo-jin. The trajectories traced like flashes, leaving afterimages. It was a threatening series of attacks.\nSeo-jin retreated and summoned her minions. Skeletal beasts, wrapped in violet magic, rose from the ground.\nThe beasts leaped towards Woo-jin. Numerous skulls, wrapped in haze-like magic, filled Woo-jin’s vision. The magic had already turned into bone and flesh, solid as armor.\nBut it was futile.\nWoo-jin drew a new short staff from his belt.\nThwack!\nWhen he swung the staff, an iron rod was drawn out from within.\nLightning Rod.\nIt had already stabilized enough to be reused thanks to its magical circuit.\nWoo-jin swung the Lightning Rod, causing an explosion of electricity.\nBoom!!\nThe fierce shockwave shattered the skeletal beasts, and the waves of electricity swept them all away.\n“……!”\nSeo-jin’s astonished face was hidden behind her skull mask. The power released from the Lightning Rod was beyond belief. How refined must the magic be to produce such might?\n…There was no time to marvel.\nWhoosh!\nWoo-jin kicked off the ground. He shot forward like an arrow, piercing through the explosion of electricity and causing a sonic boom. With excellent magic control, he greatly enhanced his leg strength and charged. His movements quickly closed the gap with Seo-jin.\nBut Seo-jin was not slow in her response.\nWhirr!\nA magic formation unfolded in the air, and a giant skeletal arm, imbued with necromantic power, stretched out. It was a partial summoning.\nAs if anticipating it, Woo-jin swung the Iron Dragon Staff without a hint of surprise.\nClang!!!\nThe Iron Dragon Staff sliced through the air, splitting it in an instant.\nIn the blink of an eye, the skeletal arm was shattered. Woo-jin’s attack speed and reflexes were on a different level from ordinary students.\nIn a single move, Woo-jin closed the distance to Seo-jin.\n“What are you trying to awaken?”\n“I have no obligation to tell you.”\nWhoosh!!\nA large skeletal beast summoned behind Seo-jin charged at Woo-jin. It was a bipedal, heavily armored elite summon.\nIt swung its massive fist like a cannonball.\nWhoosh!!\nThe fist only cleaved the empty air, but the mere force of it caused a violent gust, shaking the air.\nWoo-jin had already dodged to the side, avoiding the attack.\nThud!\nHe and the elite summon exchanged blows.\nSeo-jin continued to summon more skeletal beasts. All the minions roared like beasts and charged at Woo-jin as their prey.\nBoom!\nThe clash of magic caused the ground to crack, and the skeletal beasts’ bones and flesh were shattered.\nHowever, even Woo-jin had his limits.\nCrack!\n“Grrk!”\nThe coordination of the skeletal beasts was quite skilled. It was as if they had been practicing together for years, like circus performers.\nIt was only natural.\nSeo-jin was focusing on Woo-jin, displaying her adept control abilities without reservation.\nIn the end, the elite summon’s fist successfully struck Woo-jin. The force in that punch was enough to easily create cracks in the ground.\nWoo-jin used his Iron Dragon Staff to block the attack with his hand, but he was pushed back, receiving a heavy blow to his chest.\nThud!!!\nWoo-jin’s body pierced through the air at great speed.\nCrash!\nWoo-jin collided with a structure, leaving a crater. Without giving him a moment to rest, the elite summon lunged forward, ready to swing its fist. It had physical capabilities that could overwhelm even most Tier 5 rankers.\n“Haa…!”\nWoo-jin caught his breath and regained his senses.\nPouring magic into his chest at the last moment had saved him from a fatal injury. However, his bones were broken.\nThere was no time to relax. Woo-jin quickly regained his posture.\nWhoosh!\nClang!!\nWoo-jin swung the Iron Dragon Staff to counterattack.\nThe two entities continued their fierce battle.\nAt that moment.\n“……!”\nWhoosh…\nA sudden chill, like a winter breeze brushing against the skin, swept over his entire body.\nWoo-jin’s eyes widened in surprise.\nSeo-jin was beginning to draw out a large amount of sinister magic.\nHolding her staff in both hands, she chanted an incantation in an incomprehensible language.\nWoo-jin knew that pattern well.\nThis was dangerous.\nRumble…\nA 4-meter diameter violet summoning circle unfolded behind Seo-jin.\nFollowing the summoning circle, a long beam of light was emitted.\nThud!\nA massive skeletal arm emerged from the summoning circle, grasping the ground, and its owner slowly rose.\nThe skeletal beast, intricately carved with necromantic power, gradually revealed its massive frame.\nApproximately 5 meters tall.\nIt had nothing above its neck.\nIts body size was comparable to that of a dinosaur.\nIts thick arms contrasted with its frail waist. The lower part extended into a dress-like shape of magic.\nAt the center of its body, like other summons, a feminine skeleton, infused with violet magic, protruded.\nIt was both alien and grotesque, evoking a strange aesthetic sense.\nCarmen.\nThe monstrous creature let out a beautiful vocalization.\n‘Why is that already…?’\nUnique necromancy.\nMagic Ritual Type 5, ‘Requiem.’\nThe final pattern of a necromancer.\nIt was also known as her ultimate technique.\nCarmen began to sing a beautiful song in an unknown language. The melody was romantic and mysterious, evoking a sense of melancholy, flowing with a lyrical and vivid tune.\nSimultaneously, bright violet magic rose around her, creating a simple stage and engraving an area. The area extended beyond the battlefield of Woo-jin and Seo-jin, encompassing a wide radius.\nIt resembled an opera house.\nWhoever stood on this stage would lose their bodily functions the moment the requiem ended.\nIndeed.\nDeath was imminent.\nThe length of the song was precisely 1 minute and 30 seconds.\nResponses: Flee far enough not to hear the song, defeat Carmen, or render Seo-jin combat ineffective.\nEscaping from here is impossible. Carmen possesses monstrous strength fitting her massive body, making her difficult to defeat easily. Overpowering Seo-jin within 1 minute and 30 seconds is undoubtedly challenging. In essence, the Requiem was akin to a death sentence for Woo-jin.\n“……”\nSeo-jin lowered her head.\nThe reason she had exhausted her magic to unveil her final means wasn’t because Woo-jin’s attacks were threatening.\nIt was because she wanted to end this fight as soon as possible.\nFighting against the Disciplinary Committee Leader, who had cared for and regarded her well, was tormenting.\n“You.”\nA voice as sharp as a blade pierced Seo-jin’s ears.\nCold, murderous turquoise eyes were directed at her.\n“You intend to kill everyone like this.”\nWoo-jin’s eyes were filled with emotions so precisely refined that even Seo-jin found them chilling.\nSeo-jin closed her eyes and summoned more minions, pulling up the remaining magic. All of them charged toward Woo-jin.\nWoo-jin’s hand could no longer reuse the Lightning Rod. He returned it to its short staff form and secured it to his belt, then drew another black short staff.\nThwack!\nAs he swung the short staff, an iron rod sprang out. It was a basic three-section staff. Woo-jin now held the Iron Dragon Staff in one hand and the three-section staff in the other.\nTurquoise magic, potent enough to threaten even Tier 5 rankers, roared ferociously.\nA sharp series of attacks followed, fiercely cutting through Seo-jin’s minion army.\nThud!\nBoom!\nCrackle!!\nWoo-jin fought fiercely.\nThe beasts forced their way into his movements, leaving wounds all over his body. Woo-jin’s body was gradually cut and wounded, accumulating numerous injuries.\nHowever, Woo-jin did not lose focus.\nHe concentrated on his magic control.\nHe observed the enemies’ movements closely.\nHe responded to their attacks efficiently and swung his weapons relentlessly.\nHe emitted shockwaves, smashing the enemies.\n40 seconds left until the Requiem ended.\nAn elite summon threw a vicious punch.\nAt the time, both the Iron Dragon Staff and the three-section staff were occupied with repelling other beasts. Woo-jin gritted his teeth, poured magic into his head, and thrust his head forward fiercely.\nBoom!*\nA near-explosive sound erupted. Woo-jin had countered the summon’s punch with his forehead. His brain rang, but Woo-jin didn’t care.\nWoo-jin didn’t budge. It was because he had planted his feet firmly on the ground.\nBlood poured down, soaking his face. However, amidst the blood-stained face, the two turquoise eyes displayed fierce determination.\nThud!!\nWoo-jin swung the Iron Dragon Staff vigorously, creating multiple explosive shockwaves that sent the elite summon flying. It was a powerful strike, capable of crushing steel like paper.\nWoo-jin dodged the swift attacks of the beasts and gradually defeated them one by one.\n25 seconds left until the Requiem ended.\n“……?”\nSeo-jin felt puzzled.\n‘Why… is his movement becoming…?’",

Even the basic three-section staff only had a faint lingering of lightning magic.\nWoo-jin, dripping blood, looked down at his Iron Dragon Staff. His magic was nearly at its limit. Even squeezing out the remaining magic would only produce one or two more shockwaves.\nBut there were still many of Seo-jin’s minions left.\n20 seconds left until the Requiem ended.\nThe song, which had been flowing with a serene melody, was nearing its epilogue.\nThe battle continued.\nWoo-jin could no longer unleash powerful attacks to conserve magic. Slowly, he was being pushed back.\n“……”\nAmidst the relentless swinging of the three-section staff, hoping for the enemies’ destruction, Woo-jin suddenly felt as if he was climbing a steep staircase.\nAs if he might lose his balance and fall, he cautiously took one step at a time, continuing his arduous climb.\nAt the end of the stairs, someone seemed to be calling him.\n18 seconds left until the Requiem ended.\nThud.\nHe lost his balance.\nMomentarily struck unconscious by the beasts’ attacks.\nHowever, just before falling, like grabbing the edge of a cliff.\nBarely catching his slipping consciousness, the darkening vision cleared again.\nHis strength was nearly depleted.\nHe felt the flame of life weakening.\nIt was because the Requiem was gnawing at his life force like a rat.\nIt didn’t matter.\nThe persistent will, lingering like an afterimage, still drove Woo-jin forward.\nWith all his might, Woo-jin pressed on.\n16 seconds left until the Requiem ended.\n“It’s… over now.”\nSeo-jin removed her skull mask and looked at Woo-jin with her bare face.\nIt wasn’t expressionless.\nHer eyes were sunken.\nA complex expression filled her face.\n14 seconds left until the Requiem ended.\n“Thank you for caring for me. And, I’m sorry. Goodbye.”\nSeeing that smile filled Woo-jin with annoyance.\nIt was unbearably irritating.\nThat attitude of pushing people to death while immersed in her own story and sentiment.\nAnd still expressing gratitude and apology properly.\nWoo-jin found it intolerably detestable.\n11 seconds left until the Requiem ended.\n“…I’m not going anywhere.”\nWoo-jin, with anger-filled eyes wide open, wore a smile on his lips.\n“I need to catch you.”\n8 seconds left until the Requiem ended.\n“…That won’t happen.”\n“It will.”\n6 seconds left until the Requiem ended.\nThump.\nThump.\nSuddenly, as if watching a video in slow motion, the scenery in Woo-jin’s vision flowed slowly.\nThump!\nThump!\nHis heart pounded more wildly.\nIt wasn’t because of excitement.\nHis heartbeat was following the intense pulsation of something deeply seated within his body.\nA strange sensation surged up his spine like a geyser, spreading chills throughout his body.\nSomething was about to explode.\nWith each step, as Woo-jin ascended the mental staircase, the pulsation grew more vivid.\nFinally, Woo-jin realized what the sensation of climbing stairs was.\nRepeating the magic training countless times, enduring hellish training under his master, constantly fighting to protect students as the Disciplinary Committee Leader.\nIt was the arduous journey he had walked to overcome the towering wall of the next stage.\n“Because I’m the Disciplinary Committee Leader.”\nHis turquoise eyes, leaking magic, were tinged with red.\nSo much blood was flowing down his forehead that it seeped through his eyelashes, staining his eyeballs.\nSeo-jin’s summons were still rushing towards him.\nWoo-jin, staring at Seo-jin beyond them, closed his eyes.\nHe lifted his head.\nHe savored the breeze stirred by the magic waves, the cold air imbued with necromantic magic.\nFinally.\nWoo-jin’s fingertips touched the end of the stairs.\n***\n“…Huh?”\nFor a moment, Seo-jin lost her sense of reality.\nThe Requiem abruptly stopped.\nSilence fell.\nAs if time had frozen.\nIt felt like floating in the sky.\nNo, like drifting in the middle of the universe.\nSeo-jin felt an inexplicable sense of buoyancy and emptiness.\n“!”\nAt that moment, Seo-jin felt a gaze upon her. As she looked up, an enigmatic entity etched itself into her vision. A colossal demon with goat horns and golden fleece.\nThis supreme being was the first to descend into this world when “The Hole” appeared in the Pacific and was also the one to close The Hole and ascend to the heavens.\nSeo-jin knew this entity’s name.\nGolden Sheep.\nThe apex of all living beings.\nA being evaluated at Tier 9 and worshipped as a god.\nFrom a very distant place, its many pairs of eyes were focused on her.\nAn overwhelming fear, etched into her very being, engulfed Seo-jin. It was the pressure of an entity of a fundamentally different tier.\n“Gah! Hah!”\nSeo-jin clutched her chest, gasping for breath. Before she knew it, she was back in reality.\n‘What was that…?’\nIt was too vivid to be a hallucination. Yet, if it wasn’t a hallucination, there was no way to explain the phenomenon she had just experienced.\nWhy had the image of the Golden Sheep emanated from Woo-jin, vividly entering her vision? Seo-jin couldn’t understand.\nAt that moment.\n“……!”\nA massive magical power descended, as heavy as gravity. The pressure, as if it had physical force, crushed Seo-jin.\nGoosebumps rose all over her body. It was a threatening magic that triggered a primal fear. Anyone outside the barrier would have surely felt it as well.\nUpon realizing it, Woo-jin was nowhere to be seen.\nCrack!!\nA strange loud noise suddenly echoed.\nIt came from above. Seo-jin quickly looked up.\nThe air was splitting. Something that shouldn’t be split was cracking apart.\nIt was like a glass window shattering.\n2 seconds left until the Requiem ended.\n“What is…?”\nAn otherworldly light glimmered through the cracks, like a gate connecting to another world.\n“That’s impossible…!”\nSeo-jin’s face contorted with shock.\nImmediately.\nA flash of light burst through the cracks.\n“……!”\nRumble!!!\nA turquoise lightning bolt, tinged with black light, poured down vertically like a waterfall.\nSpatial Lightning Strike.\nThe brilliant lightning engulfed Carmen destructively. Its power was incomprehensible. The density of the magic was beyond imagination.\nCarmen’s song, her screams, everything was devoured by the thunderous roar. Unable to utter her final verse, Carmen ultimately vanished.\n“Gah!”\nBoom!!\nThe shockwave from the lightning sent Seo-jin flying.\nThe highest unique ability.\nControlling a universal law.\nAmong them, ‘space’. At this moment, the ability to control space was bestowed upon a man.\nContinuous manipulation of lightning magic.\nThis was not the level of someone who had just awakened a unique ability. The immense potential suppressed by the high wall of Tier 5 was now explosively unleashed.\nEven so, hadn’t Woo-jin’s magic power almost been depleted?\nHow could he unleash such powerful lightning magic?\nIt must be that as Woo-jin reached a new stage, some of the blocked magic circuits burst open, showing dramatic recovery. Like water pouring out fiercely after a dam collapses.\n‘…He’s a monster. Different from someone like me.’ Seo-jin thought involuntarily as she flew through the air. There was no chance of victory against such a being.\nJust as she was about to give up, memories flashed through Seo-jin’s mind.\nFriends disappearing one by one under the Head Principal’s management.\nThe beautiful sea she had seen in the movie.\n“I can’t…!”\nSeo-jin couldn’t give up.\nShe gritted her teeth, steeled her resolve, and forcibly drew up her magic.\nCrack!!\nAnother shattering sound.\n“!”\nThe source of the sound was from behind Seo-jin, where her body was flying.\nSeo-jin quickly looked back.\nBoom!\nFrom the gate that appeared in the air, a man shot out with turquoise lightning, tinged with black light. His two vicious turquoise eyes bore into Seo-jin.\nSuddenly, Seo-jin had a fresh realization. When she saw the sea in the movie. The reason she decided to live even in this city was simply because she wanted to live.\nEven if she became a person deserving of the world’s criticism, a piece of trash.\nTo avoid being discarded by the Head Principal and just survive, Seo-jin chose to sacrifice others to live.\nThe sea was just a trigger.\nAnything would have sufficed.\nIf there was a reason to survive… she could justify trampling others.\nPerhaps the man before her was the price she had to pay.\nCrackle!!!\n“Gah!!!”\nThe Iron Dragon Staff, charged with lightning, struck Seo-jin’s body. The power was so overwhelming that even her magic-enhanced body couldn’t withstand it.\nSeo-jin’s ribs shattered, and the fierce lightning burned parts of her body.\nCountless strands of turquoise electricity intertwined like chains, tearing through the air. It was Woo-jin’s final, most powerful strike.\nBoom!!!\nWith a thunderous roar, Seo-jin’s body cut through the air at tremendous speed.\nCrash!!!\nWith a resounding explosion, Seo-jin’s body created a crater on the ground and lost consciousness.",

      "content": "Chapter 42 – Rule 18: The Leader Thwarts the Villain’s Plan (6)\nAhsung High School Training Grounds.\nThe necromancer’s barrier, “Spirit Realm,” was under full-scale assault from the moment it was deployed.\nStorms raged, and thunder roared. Sword strikes imbued with magic lashed out incessantly at the barrier with the speed of rapid-fire bullets.\nCrackling!\nUsing her unique ability, **Eun Sa**, Magic Formula Type 2, **Butterfly Effect**, sharp magical energy splintered into dozens of threads with each sword strike, trying to cleave the barrier. But it was futile. With a soft sound, all attacks were absorbed.\nIt was like trying to cut water with a knife. Literally.\nHowever, Oh Baek-seo did not give up. With wings enveloped in the storm’s blue light, she flew like a butterfly, continuously striking the barrier while analyzing it to find a weakness.\nThe usual gentle smile on Baek-seo’s face was nowhere to be seen. Her expression was far from composed.\nWoo-jin was trapped inside the barrier, and the overwhelming magic that had made even Baek-seo shudder since the barrier’s deployment was palpable.\nIt was only natural to feel a sense of foreboding.\nThis was why Baek-seo was urgently launching an offensive.\nSimilarly, the academy forces poured firepower into the barrier. They attacked simultaneously, sometimes targeting a single point, but their efforts bore no fruit.\nNevertheless, they did not give up.\nEventually.\nAt a certain moment.\n“……!”\nGroan.\nA massive surge of magic roared from within the barrier. It was a different kind of power than what had been felt before.\nBaek-seo’s eyes widened.\nEveryone inside and outside the barrier felt it.\nSomething overwhelming had awakened.\nSssss!\nAbout ten seconds later, the Spirit Realm began to dissolve from the center.\n** * * **\n“Huff, huff….”\nClutching his broken ribs, Woo-jin staggered out. His breathing was still not settled. The pain from the broken ribs stabbing his organs was intense, making even walking a challenge.\nHe had no time to relish his victory.\nNor did he feel any joy in having finally awakened his unique ability.\nHe just wanted to rest as soon as possible.\nHe had lost too much blood. Sleep was creeping in.\nBut he had to endure. Falling asleep thoughtlessly here might mean death.\nDuring the battle with Han Seo-jin, Woo-jin realized what had happened to him.\nEveryone who reaches Tier 5 says the same thing. Just before their unique ability blossoms, they feel a premonition as if something is about to awaken in their chest.\nWoo-jin felt that same sensation.\nFighting to the death had finally awakened his unique ability.\nIt was a ridiculous situation. The conditions for awakening were too harsh.\nWell, considering he could immediately use techniques that synergize unique abilities with elemental powers at Tier 6, it wasn’t all bad….\n…Enough. He would think about the unique ability later.\nHe had lost too much blood to ponder complicated matters.\nSsss.\nThe immobilized skeletal beasts were gradually being unsummoned.\nSimultaneously, the barrier that had lost its master began to dissipate, revealing the cloudy night sky.\nSuddenly, rain poured down, drenching him. It was due to the storm clouds created by Baek-seo’s unique ability hovering in the sky.\nThey must have been doing all sorts of things outside the barrier.\n“Ugh…”\nUnable to muster any more strength in his legs, Woo-jin collapsed. He truly couldn’t move.\nThere was still a considerable distance to Seo-jin.\nSeo-jin, who had apparently regained consciousness, was weakly breathing despite the blood that had erupted from her mouth. She looked quite serene, except for that.\n“I lost…”\nSeo-jin’s voice barely reached Woo-jin’s ears through the pouring rain.\nAt that moment.\nCrack.\nSuddenly, purple magic began to envelop Seo-jin’s feet, turning into crystals. The crystallization climbed from her ankles to her calves, then her thighs….\n“What’s happening to your body? What’s wrong?”\n“It’s the penalty… for my ability… I overdid it a bit… cough!”\nSeo-jin’s transformation resembled the skeletal beasts she had controlled like her own limbs.\nIn the game, the unique abilities of the six sinners were not known to have any specific usage conditions or penalties. Naturally, Woo-jin was unaware of the penalties for necromancy.\nThe more powerful the unique ability, the more stringent the activation conditions or severe the penalties.\nNecromancy was undoubtedly an exceptional ability.\nIts use might not have strict conditions, but the penalty was extreme.\nWoo-jin didn’t know if his unique ability had any penalties, but he was fine for now, so he would think about it later.\nHe needed to stop the crystallization first.\nHe didn’t know how, but he couldn’t let her escape.\n“Ugh…!”\nNo matter how much he tried to move his body, he couldn’t muster any strength.\n“Leader, do you know why… I joined the Disciplinary Committee?”\nSeo-jin’s body was half solidified in purple by then. The reason she enrolled in Ahsung High and her actions today must be related.\nBut why did she join the Disciplinary Committee?\n“Oh Baek-seo….”\nSeo-jin’s unexpected words made Woo-jin’s eyes widen.\n“Baek-seo?”\n“I was told to… watch her….”\nAt that moment.\nRumble!\n“!”\nA foreboding sound came from the ground.\nRumble!!\nThe ground shook violently.\nCrash!!\nA massive creature burst from the ground.\nIts gaping maw swallowed Seo-jin whole.\nIt was a giant worm made of dense purple magic.\n‘What is this!?’\nIt was an entirely unforeseen situation.\nThe worm rose upward, coiling its body. The purple magic that made up its body shifted like clay, transforming into a massive humanoid monster.\nIt was larger than Carmen, the giant summoned through necromancy earlier.\nA strange magic pulsed through the giant’s body.\nAt the center of its translucent form was Seo-jin, fully crystallized. She seemed to be its core.\nA particularly noticeable feature was the large skull at its head, from which glowed eerie eyes.\nHeavy magic covered its skin.\nThe same magic that had been felt from the ground earlier.\nWoo-jin didn’t know what this monster was, but it was undoubtedly the entity aiding Seo-jin from below.\n‘I’m certain. That thing is at least Tier 7.’",

      "content": "Chapter 42 (Continued)\nIt was a monster on a different level from Seo-jin.\nLooking closer, it wasn’t even a living being.\nIt seemed to have a definite will, possibly contained in that mysterious skull.\n‘Was she trying to awaken this?’\nHad Seo-jin intended to pay the price of blood to awaken this giant from beneath the ground?\nWould it have become an even greater monster if her plan had succeeded?\nFor now, it was temporarily using Seo-jin’s power as its own.\nHe couldn’t know for sure.\nBut one thing was certain: he felt a clear malice emanating from it.\nAs if it intended to complete what Seo-jin had failed to do.\nScreech!\nThe giant let out a bizarre wail, summoning skeletal beasts wrapped in dense purple magic. They were far more powerful than the minions Seo-jin had summoned.\nWoo-jin could only watch with open eyes.\nHe couldn’t move anymore. He had no strength left to fight.\nHowever, he did not feel anxious.\nWith the Spirit Realm undone, reinforcements would arrive soon.\nSuddenly, an illusion of a swarm of blue butterflies made of vibrant magic descended from the sky.\nCrash!\nIn an instant, blue lightning struck, carving dozens of sword paths into the purple giant. These strikes could easily slice through steel.\nThe blue butterflies rode the rain and lightning, revealing themselves before Woo-jin.\nOh Baek-seo.\nHer back, holding the white saber, came into Woo-jin’s view.\nShe had arrived just in time.\n“Baek-seo…”\nThere was no strength in his voice.\nIt was already difficult enough just to hold onto his consciousness.\n“You’re safe now. Sorry I was late….”\nBaek-seo’s voice trembled. She seemed reluctant to show her face to him.\nArrows and magic projectiles rained down from all directions, targeting the giant. It was support fire from the Disciplinary Committee.\nBoom! Boom!\nThe giant let out a monstrous roar as it was engulfed in explosions.\n“Are the members… and the instructors assisting as well?”\n“Yes. I issued an emergency summon. Doha is supporting with long-range fire alongside the Disciplinary Committee and teachers, Yesong is gathering the remaining members, and Minhyuk is helping the injured. The rest of the Disciplinary Committee will join us soon.”\nBaek-seo answered calmly, her eyes never leaving the enemy.\n“What about the evacuation of the students?”\n“It’s underway. We need to hold this thing off and buy time….”\nThe aftermath of the explosion was swept away by the rain. However, the giant seemed unscathed.\nMost of the attacks had been ineffective.\nThe numerous sword wounds inflicted by Baek-seo had already healed. The giant had monstrous regenerative abilities.\n“Ordinary attacks don’t seem to work.”\nBaek-seo narrowed her eyes and charged at the giant.\nMany skeletal beasts lunged at her, but a tranquil flow of magic caused them to be sliced down in an instant.\nDespite Baek-seo’s attacks and the Disciplinary Committee’s support fire, their efforts couldn’t keep up with the giant’s regenerative abilities.\nIf only Woo-jin were in better shape, or at least if Ha Yesong were here, they might have had a chance.\nEven then, defeating this giant was uncertain.\nSwoosh!\nThe giant clasped its hands together, inscribing numerous summoning circles in the air.\nGiant skeletal arms extended from each circle, the giant manipulating them as if they were its own limbs. It moved with the fluidity of a Buddhist Asura.\nThe giant retaliated against Baek-seo and blocked the support fire with its skeletal arms.\n“……”\nWhat was its weakness?\nIt was not visible.\nIf there were any assumptions to be made about its weak points, Baek-seo would have already attempted them. She was also trying to find the giant’s weakness while fighting.\nScreech!!\nThe giant roared again, its heavy magic surging like a storm, pushing Baek-seo back and sweeping away nearby structures.\n“Ugh!”\nWoo-jin was also blown away, but Baek-seo quickly caught him and distanced them from the giant.\n“Leader, are you okay!?”\n“I’m… fine…! We need a strategy….”\n“Yes. Our current firepower seems ineffective.”\nThe giant remained intact, continually summoning skeletal beasts and threatening the area.\nIt was clear that it intended to carry out the massacre that Seo-jin had failed to achieve.\nIf things continued this way, it was only a matter of time.\nAs Woo-jin and Baek-seo reached a wooded area, the giant’s glowing skull focused on them.\n‘…Wait.’\nSuddenly, a new thought struck Woo-jin’s mind.\n“Hmm?”\nWith the little strength he had recovered, Woo-jin grabbed Baek-seo’s wrist. She looked at him questioningly.\n“Why?”\nIn the game, whether Seo-jin succeeded in causing many casualties or not, the giant ultimately appeared.\nIf it emerged from the test site, it would be a catastrophe.\nYet… in the game, this situation somehow resolved itself.\nEven if Ahsung High managed to defeat the giant by pouring in all its resources, it would have taken a considerable amount of time.\nThere were no reports of the giant causing uncontrollable damage.\nNor did it seem likely that the giant would simply disappear.\nTherefore.\n‘There must be something….’\nThere might be something more he didn’t know.\nJust then.\n“!”\nWoo-jin and Baek-seo’s bodies shuddered reflexively.\nAs if confirming Woo-jin’s suspicions, a powerful magic presence began to descend from the sky.\nThe giant seemed to sense the ominous presence as well, lifting its head.\nAs if a meteor were falling, something was plummeting toward them. On closer inspection, it was a person enveloped in flames caused by air friction.\nThe person clenched their fist and finally reached the giant.\nThey struck with their fist.\nBOOM!!!\nA thunderous explosion.\nThe explosive impact of the punch and the immense gravity crushed the giant’s body. The giant burst apart, its dark purple flesh scattering to the ground.\nThe force of the impact created a deep crater, and the surrounding skeletal beasts were obliterated.\nHowever, Seo-jin’s crystallized body remained intact as it fell to the ground.\nWhoosh!\nThe wind pressure and shockwave from the impact swept away the surrounding structures and trees, but Baek-seo protected Woo-jin.\nStep. Step.\nThe figure emerged from the dust and walked out of the deep crater.\nA man with a fierce grin, baring his large teeth.\n“……”\nWoo-jin and Baek-seo held their breath, staring at the person who had defeated the giant with a single blow.\nLong hair reminiscent of Samson from the Bible.\nA height of 2.3 meters.\nMuscles developed like a beast’s, bulging under a tight long coat and battle suit.\n“Baek-seo, follow my instructions without question.”\nCold sweat ran down Woo-jin’s cheek.\n“Run away immediately.”\nThe strongest in Neo Seoul.\nHis final task.\nThe Outlaw.\nAlias,\nGoliath.\nHe had appeared.",

      "content": "Chapter 43 – Rule 18: The Leader Thwarts the Villain’s Plan (7)\nGoliath.\nOne of the six sinners.\nHe is one of the Great Villains that bring about dystopia, and in the game, he is the final boss villain renowned for being the most difficult challenge.\nUndoubtedly, he was the worst task I had to deal with.\nGoliath’s tier isn’t clear.\nHowever, he is at least in the upper echelons of the 7th Tier.\nHe is the first of the New Humanity predicted to reach or have reached the Argonaut stage.\nEven though I trained relentlessly to become stronger in Goliath’s manner, or even more intensely, I still judged myself as ‘ordinary.’\nAnyone would think the same when compared to someone like him.\nCome to think of it, the rain had stopped. It seemed that Goliath’s fall had dispelled the thunderclouds.\n“…Sorry, but it’s going to be difficult.”\nOh Baek-seo couldn’t comply with my command to flee. She just clutched her white sword tightly and raised her magical power.\n“We can’t shake off something like that…”\n“No.”\nThanks to the brief rest, I managed to regain a bit of strength, enough to prop myself up against a tree.\n“Go alone…”\n“What?”\n“I have a plan… Don’t worry and just go.”\nHolding my broken rib, I barely managed to walk and stood before Baek-seo. Unable to support myself, I leaned against a nearby tree with one hand, panting.\nBaek-seo tried to support me, but I gestured her away.\n“It’s better if you withdraw now. Tell the Disciplinary Committee to stand by…”\nGoliath’s gaze was fixed on me. His steady steps approached in my direction.\nHe clearly had business with me.\n‘He must have sensed the magic power.’\nGoliath must have felt the magic power that erupted when my unique ability bloomed.\nI couldn’t stop the magic from bursting forth.\nIt felt uncontrollable, like soda fizzing uncontrollably when you drop candy into it.\nMoreover, Goliath would have sensed the magic power emitted by the 7th Tier monster that burst from the ground. That magic power blatantly screamed, ‘Here I am, come catch me.’\n‘So, in the game, Goliath defeated that monster and left?’\nIn the game, Goliath seemed to lose interest after defeating the monster in one blow and left immediately.\n‘That guy enjoys fighting strong opponents.’\nGoliath is the kind who enjoys fighting strong opponents. As soon as he felt the 7th Tier magic power, he would have rushed over in excitement. No, he must have flown here.\nAnyway, my unique ability’s bloom has become a variable.\nGoliath, who should have left immediately, was now held here, curious about me.\n‘What’s worth betting on is that I’m in a lousy state right now. That guy wouldn’t be interested in fighting me as I am now.’\nMeeting an opponent with a decent ability that can’t fight right now?\nWhat fun would there be in fighting someone like that?\nHe might let me go, like saving the best dish for later.\n‘So if only Goliath and I remain here, I might spoil his mood and buy time to come up with a plan.’\nBut if Baek-seo shows fighting intent or the Disciplinary Committee launches an attack?\nGoliath would think we were picking a fight and would try to crush us right here.\nFighting Goliath should be based on my game knowledge, using the right strategy at the right time.\nThat’s why I wanted to send Baek-seo away and have the Disciplinary Committee stand by.\n‘If he still attacks then…’\nThere’s no choice.\nWhatever happens, happens.\n“The Disciplinary Committee is prioritizing student evacuation and providing long-range support,” Baek-seo said.\n“Since the target disappeared, they’re probably waiting for orders now.”\nShe meant they were already on standby.\n“And I…”\nBaek-seo couldn’t finish her sentence.\nSeeing her hesitation, it seemed she couldn’t bring herself to run away.\nAs I was about to urge her, Goliath spoke up.\n“You’re the one…! The one who leaked ‘that magic power’!”\nHis deep yet energetic voice vibrated through the air.\nConsidering his words and the context, it was certain he had sensed the magic power.\nSlam!\nI pulled out the Iron Dragon staff from my belt, swinging it to draw out the iron rod inside.\n“Why did you appear before the Disciplinary Committee?”\nI asked calmly, pretending to be at ease.\n“Here for a fight?”\n“State your name!”\nHe’s not listening…\nI didn’t expect much.\nI knew Goliath’s name well.\nAnd I didn’t want to see him trying all sorts of tricks to learn my name.\nSo, I answered honestly.\n“…Ahn Woo-jin.”\n“I see… Remember that!”\nAt those words, Goliath suddenly bent his knees.\n“Leader!”\n“!”\nBoom!!\nGoliath pushed off the ground and leaped toward me.",

      "content": "Chapter 43 (Continued)\nIt was like an explosion, a sonic boom spreading out. The ground he kicked shattered, sending debris flying.\nGoliath quickly closed the distance between us, preparing to swing his fist. The space around his fist seemed distorted. It was his unique ability at work.\nBaek-seo desperately pulled my shoulder back, trying to face Goliath.\n‘…So it comes to this.’\nDamn it.\nThere was no time to think.\nAt the very least, I didn’t want Baek-seo to get hurt.\nWith my last bit of strength, I pushed Baek-seo aside. It was a reflexive action.\nSurprised by being pushed, Baek-seo stumbled to the side.\nGoliath’s fist approached my face. I felt like my body was being dragged. His fist carried a heavy gravitational force.\nThat fist would pull the enemy with strong gravity and deliver devastating power.\nSeeing Goliath’s movement, there was no room to dodge.\nI didn’t even have the strength to swing the Iron Dragon Staff.\nThis was a test.\nWhether I could withstand Goliath’s punch.\nJudging by the magic and momentum, it wasn’t as powerful as when he defeated the 7th Tier monster earlier.\nIf I could withstand it, I could hope for the next time.\nI glared into Goliath’s golden eyes.\nHe was looking at me with a smiling face.\nI had struggled so much to get here.\nI couldn’t die easily.\nI would endure with sheer willpower.\nAs we locked eyes, at that moment…\nEverything in my view began to move in slow motion.\nCrack!\nBetween Goliath and me,\na crack appeared in the air, and his fist plunged into it.\n* * *\nA mysterious floating sensation enveloped Goliath.\nSurrounded by silence.\nGoliath saw a girl with golden hair.\nShe was a beautiful girl, wrapped in a soft glow.\nThe girl spoke softly, moving her lips gently.\n─Disappear.\n* * *\nCrack!\nAnother crack appeared beside Goliath’s head.\nGoliath’s fist, which had passed through the crack in front of me, emerged from the new crack.\nTime resumed its normal flow.\nBoom!\nGoliath’s fist, deflecting itself, generated a fierce shockwave.\nWith a thunderous sound, Goliath’s body flew at an alarming speed, and Baek-seo and I were swept by the shockwave, rolling on the ground multiple times.\nScreech!\nGoliath, grinning as he sliced through the air, landed on his feet, crossing his arms and standing still.\nDespite the intense friction causing heat where his feet dragged across the ground, he maintained his stance until he came to a stop.\nAs his unnecessarily impressive stance suggested, he was a guy who lived and died by his pride.\n“Ugh…”\nGroaning in pain, I barely managed to sit up.\n‘What just happened?’\nI was clearly out of magic power.\nYet, a crack had formed on its own, diverting Goliath’s punch. It was as if someone else had controlled my ability.\nBaek-seo seemed shocked by the crack that suddenly appeared and counterattacked Goliath. However, she didn’t dwell on it and quickly came to my side, taking a defensive stance to protect me.\nSwish! The crack converged into a line and disappeared, like a TV screen turning off.\n“It was correct…! You finally showed yourself!”\nGoliath shouted in a voice mixed with beastly breaths, sounding delighted.\nHe didn’t seem the least bit flustered.\nDespite not appearing to know my ability, he seemed to have expected this outcome.\nPointing at me with a smile, Goliath declared,\n“That’s the ‘Blessing of the Golden Sheep’!”\n“…?”\nThe Blessing of the Golden Sheep.\nRecalling my game knowledge, it was a mysterious trait bestowed upon Goliath.\nIn moments of crisis, it would protect him just once.\nConsidering it could be triggered every encounter, it must have had a cooldown period.\nIn the game, this trait made Goliath a particularly tricky opponent.\nIs he implying that I now possess that blessing?\n“…”\nThe phenomenon that occurred earlier was indeed something that could be called a ‘blessing.’\nOnly Goliath, who had received the Blessing of the Golden Sheep, could have recognized it.\nSo that’s why he wasn’t surprised.\n“…Baek-seo, help me up.”\n“Okay.”\nBaek-seo put my arm around her shoulder and helped me to my feet.\n“Ahn Woo-jin!”\n“What?”\nGoliath shouted boldly,\n“Don’t die to the small fry overflowing in this city…!”\nIt wasn’t an out-of-the-blue concern.\nThe meaning was clear.\nIt was exactly what I expected.\nTo eat the fruit, you have to wait for it to ripen first.\nHe planned to wait for me to become stronger.\nI had caught his interest.\nGoliath smiled widely, bending his knees.\nBoom!!\nHe leaped into the sky, creating a sonic boom.\nAnd with that, Goliath disappeared into the sky.",

      "content": "Chapter 44 – Rule 19. The Leader Tests His Unique Ability (1)\nSeveral hectic days had passed.\nIn the Disciplinary Committee’s executive office.\nI sat at my desk, covered in bandages, receiving healing magic from a healer while reviewing documents.\nThe Han Seo-jin incident had been concluded.\nThere were many injuries but no deaths.\n‘No deaths… Unbelievable.’\nAccording to the account from Kim Deok-soo, a member of the Disciplinary Committee who was present at the scene,\nthe Disciplinary Committee fought well against the skeletal beasts, and several students with decent combat abilities, including those from the Volunteer Department, assisted the committee.\n‘I’m not entirely sure if there were truly no deaths, though.’\nIn front of me, thanks to Lee Se-Ah’s unique ability, a junior’s life was saved.\nIt was like someone being revived by dramatic CPR right after their heart stopped.\n‘Anyway, it’s a relief in the end. But I’m worried about Se-Ah.’\nShe used a power that seemed to reverse causality.\nThere’s no telling what kind of severe penalty such an immense power might bring.\nBut since unique abilities are treated as private, she wasn’t likely to easily reveal the penalty.\nSe-Ah didn’t tell me what the penalty for her ability was either.\nI could only take comfort in the fact that she greeted me normally the next day.\n‘Han Seo-jin… We can’t touch her for a while.’\nHan Seo-jin, the perpetrator of this incident, was encased in hardened, purple magic power.\nNo matter what the Disciplinary Committee tried, the tough magic enveloping Seo-jin’s entire body wouldn’t break.\nConsidering it withstood the shockwave from Goliath’s punch, it wasn’t going to break easily.\nWe couldn’t just launch powerful attacks either.\nDoing so might break Seo-jin’s body beyond repair, and we couldn’t let the case fall into obscurity.\n‘For now, the best we can do is keep her tightly secured.’\nIn the end, Ahsung High School decided to keep Seo-jin under tight security, managed with the highest level of security measures.\n‘She’s just dealing with the penalty, so she’ll come back eventually. That’s when we’ll interrogate her.’\nIf Seo-jin returned safely,\nwe would clarify the facts and then hand her over to the trial academy.\nThe Han Seo-jin incident wouldn’t be resolved until then.\n‘There’s nothing more to see at the scene of the incident either.’\nWe thoroughly investigated the scene.\nThe monster that Goliath defeated wasn’t a living creature to begin with. If it had been tunneling underground like a giant worm, it would have been detected during the test site’s construction.\nBased on game knowledge and the investigation results, it was a catalyst.\nIn the past,\na beast with excessive magic power died buried underground.\nWith nowhere for the vast magic power to escape, it continuously condensed over time, seeping into the beast’s skeleton.\nSeo-jin must have somehow breathed life back into it.\nIt must have been a very powerful beast at one time.\nBut how did Seo-jin know such a thing was buried at the test site in advance?\nIt could only be speculation until we could interrogate him properly, but there was a theory.\n‘The Head Principal….’\nA remnant of the Old Humanity and a figure who knew everything about Academy City, Neo Seoul.\nAnd someone revealed to be behind Kim Dalbi.\nThe Head Principal, Lee Doo-hee.\nShe might have provided the information.\n‘Come to think of it, how did Seo-jin gather those skeletal beasts so easily?’\nIn the game, I dismissed it as just game mechanics, but Seo-jin managed a lot of skeletal beasts.\nHow did she contract with so many beast spirits and control them?\nIf the Head Principal helped, it made sense.\nAbove all else,\n─ ‘Oh Baek-seo… I was told to watch over her….’\nIt seemed he was following someone’s orders.\nConsidering someone who knew about Neo Seoul and could command someone like the six sinners….\nThe Head Principal was the most likely suspect.\nOf course, I couldn’t focus solely on her, attributing everything to her plan like some conspiracy theorist.\nHasty judgments were forbidden.\nWe had to extract the truth from Seo-jin.\n‘But then….’\nI turned my gaze to Oh Baek-seo, who was busy processing documents. She seemed focused on her work, given the amount to handle.\nDue to this incident, the practical evaluation was completely suspended, and the faculty, student council, and disciplinary committee were focusing on the aftermath and investigation.\n‘Why was she being watched?’\nEither the Head Principal or an unknown third party wanted information on Baek-seo.\nSince the investigation was still ongoing, we could only find out by searching Seo-jin’s belongings and residence.\nI also directly asked Baek-seo.\nYesterday, I asked, ‘Do you know Seo-jin?’\nBaek-seo firmly denied any association, saying she hadn’t even exchanged words with her.\nIt seemed like Seo-jin had been unilaterally monitoring her.\n‘This might be related to Baek-seo’s disappearance in the game.’\nIn the game, Baek-seo vanished.\nWhatever was about to happen, there might be a connection between Seo-jin monitoring Baek-seo and her disappearance.\n‘This can’t be overlooked.’\nI vowed to protect Baek-seo.\n“Leader, do you need something?”\nSensing my gaze, Baek-seo asked.\n“No, just looking.”\n“…”\nBaek-seo turned her gaze to me and stared intently.\n“Why?”\n“How’s your body holding up today?”\n“You mean the penalty?”\n“Yeah.”\nI had awakened and used my unique ability during the battle with Seo-jin.\nIt was an ability to manipulate space.\nUnless there were no strict usage conditions, there would be significant penalties due to the inverse relationship between power and penalty.\nBut….\n“…I’m fine. Strangely.”\nI looked at my hand and answered.\n“I don’t know why it’s like this.”\nIt was actually more frightening that there were no problems…!\nFor several days, I hadn’t experienced any peculiar symptoms.\nOnly the characteristic lethargy from being in a state of magic depletion.\nOnce magic is depleted, it takes a significant amount of time for the body to recover normal functionality due to the overload of magic circuits.\nEssentially, I was just an ordinary person with strength right now.\n“That’s a relief.”\nBaek-seo approached and leaned her pretty face close to mine.\nI involuntarily held my breath for a moment but didn’t show it.\nBaek-seo, who was staring at me closely, had a look of curiosity.\n“Why… does it still not feel like you’re at the 5th Tier?”\nSo she came closer to confirm.\n“Is that so. I wonder why…?”\nThose with unique abilities can instinctively sense each other.\nLike a sixth sense.\nBut for some reason, none of the executives above the 5th Tier could sense my unique ability.\nOnly Secretary Park Minhyuk congratulated me, believing fervently that I’d awakened an incredible ability like a devout follower of a new religion.\nThere was another issue.\n“Do you still not know the usage conditions?”\n“No. I have no idea. I don’t feel anything.”\nI couldn’t recall the conditions for using my unique ability. In the fight with Seo-jin, I used it instinctively.\nSo it was frustrating not being able to explain it.\n“Could it be because of the magic depletion?”\n“The conditions for using unique abilities are typically realized instinctively. You’ve already used it once, haven’t you? Even in a state of magic depletion, you should still be aware.”\nBaek-seo knew from my recounting of the fight with Seo-jin that I used my unique ability by will.\n“That’s true. I used it instinctively back then, but now I feel like I’ve forgotten that sensation….”\n“That’s unusual.”\n“Still, I have a unique ability now. It must be a temporary condition. Since the information is being controlled, it’s unlikely to cause immediate trouble. I should just wait until my magic recovers.”\nThe information that I had a unique ability was controlled at the academy level.\nLike how bad news about a powerful figure quickly disappears from the internet.\nThere were people who witnessed my ability at the scene.\nAnd there were many who had obtained the information.\nHowever, we judged it shouldn’t spread further, so I sought help from the Student Council President.",

      "content": "Chapter 44 (Continued)\nThe reason.\n─ ‘Don’t die to the small fry overflowing in this city…!’\nGoliath’s warning.\nAt first, I had no intention of hiding my unique ability once I awakened it.\nThe problem was that I had awakened a top-tier unique ability that dealt with the concept of space.\nThe more widely this information spread, the more powerful adversaries would target me.\nProof of this was that Goliath, the one I was most worried about, had already shown interest in me as his top priority.\nOf course, it was impossible to completely control the spread of this information.\nIt might be a futile effort, but it was better than doing nothing.\n“There’s a lot to do anyway.”\nIndeed, there was much to do.\nBesides investigating the incident,\nthe General Student Council of Hanyang Federal Academy sent a notice that they would investigate the incident to hold Ahsung High School accountable.\nOne of the General Student Council’s roles was to hold the respective academy responsible when an incident resulted in many student casualties.\nFacing the General Student Council head-on was our student council’s responsibility.\nHowever, the Disciplinary Committee also had plenty to do.\nProviding requested materials to the student council, attending meetings to give briefings…\n‘Well, it’s just a drop in the bucket compared to what the student council has to handle.’\nPlease let everything go smoothly without any mishaps….\nIn the game, this incident was one of the landmines that led to the impeachment of the Disciplinary Committee Leader. I just hoped I wouldn’t follow the same path.\nSwish. As fatigue suddenly washed over my eyes, I rubbed my eyes once.\n“Are you tired?”\n“I haven’t been able to sleep lately.”\nI didn’t bother denying it.\nThere was no point in hiding it from Baek-seo since she would find out anyway.\nIt was difficult to hide my fatigue to begin with.\nI was dealing with lethargy from magic depletion on top of my injuries.\nThe healer had even nagged me to be hospitalized, but a Disciplinary Committee Leader couldn’t just lie comfortably in bed while there was an incident to resolve.\n“Um… Aren’t you going to use the card?”\n“Card?”\nWhat card?\n“…Oh.”\nThat card.\nThe Oh Baek-seo usage card.\nThe card’s effect was cleaning my ears, right?\n“Especially for the Leader who worked hard this time, I can even offer a bonus pat on the head as a service.”\nBaek-seo whispered in a confidential tone, with one hand shading her mouth, a mischievous smile playing on her lips.\n‘She must be worried about me….’\nShe was being playful to show her concern and encouraging me to use the card lightly.\nI waved my hand.\n“Later. Not now.”\nI didn’t want to use that card right now.\n“Later?”\n“It doesn’t seem like the right time yet. I have work to do.”\nThis level of fatigue was bearable.\n‘I want to save that card for when I’m truly exhausted.’\nUsing that card would bring me immense happiness at that moment.\nI’d get tremendous motivation and healing.\nSo, I decided to save it for a crucial moment.\nAs long as I was the Leader, there was no expiration date on using the card.\n“…If you insist.”\nBaek-seo smiled and turned her head away from me.\nJust then, the door to the Disciplinary Committee’s executive office swung open.\n“Wild Ha Yesong has appeared!”\nThe Wild Ha Yesong, responsible for monitoring public disorder, had arrived.\nBoth Baek-seo and I turned our gazes toward Yesong.\n“Leader! You’re still alive today!”\nYesong pointed at me with both index fingers, raising one knee. Her eyes sparkled brightly.\nWhat kind of pose is that?\n“Do I look like someone who would die?”\n“Just by looking at you, it seems you could cross the River Styx at any moment. You look like you should be in a hospital bed!”\nWell, she had a point.\n“I can’t rest with just this. I’m the Leader, after all.”\n“Ah, the fighting spirit of the Disciplinary Committee Leader! I, Ha Yesong, am moved…! How about dumpling stew for lunch today?”\n“…The place where you need at least two people to order?”\n“Exactly, our Leader! Spot on!”\nSo, she wanted dumpling stew but had no one to go with.\n“Today, I, Yesong, will carry you there specially!”\n“No, that’s not necessary.”\n“No need to refuse!”\n“I said no….”\nWith Baek-seo and Yesong supporting me, I stood up and walked with crutches.\nWhen we arrived at the cafeteria, Yesong chatted cheerfully as if nothing had happened. This, too, seemed to be her way of showing concern for me.\nDumpling stew was served. Yesong praised the greatness of dumplings with exclamations as she saw the stew, which was full of dumplings, rice cakes, vegetables, and meat.\nBubble, bubble.\nAs I stared at the boiling dumpling stew, a conversation with Seo-jin suddenly came to mind.\n─ ‘…I want to see the sea.’\nI didn’t expect the broth to remind me of the sea….\nCome to think of it.\n“How’s the sea these days?”\nA sudden question popped out of my mouth.\n“Huh? Do you want to go to the artificial beach?”\nArtificial beach.\nIt wasn’t the real sea but a resort designed to resemble the old sea.\nIt had a sandy shore, a lake, and a large screen displaying the horizon.\nI remember it being quite popular.\n“No, just the sea.”\n“Oh… I think it was two days ago. An explorer who returned this time brought new photos of the sea!”\nWhat?\nReally?\nI had been so busy dealing with the incident that I hadn’t had time to check the internet.\nPhotos of the outside world brought back by explorers were rare.\nEven trying to view the Earth via satellite was challenging due to the thick magic energy and pollution caused by the beasts.\nBut this girl….\n“You had time for web surfing?”\nI narrowed my eyes and glared at Yesong.\nWe’ve been incredibly busy lately.\nI worked despite being injured.\n“Hehe.”\n“Get back to work, Ha Yesong.”\n“I am working! It was just a refresh!”\nYesong laughed awkwardly.\n“Anyway, do you want to see?”\n“…Show me.”\nYesong showed us the recent photos of the sea brought by the explorer.\n“……”\nA gloomy sky.\nThe sea, still unpurified and polluted with nuclear waste and the magic energy of beasts.\nCountless skeletons, stripped of flesh and organs, scattered without burial.\nThe eerie landscape of the coastline resembled hell.\nBeyond the horizon, gigantic, grotesque creatures walked bipedally.\nUnknown black islands and sacred altars floated in the sea.\nThe other sea photos were similar.\n“It’s fortunate that the Golden Sheep granted us safe lands, right?”\nYesong remarked suddenly.\n“…Perhaps.”\nAccording to history,\nafter the Argonauts challenged the Golden Sheep, the Golden Sheep seemed to appreciate humanity’s challenge and granted a few safe lands.\nOne of those was the center of the Korean Peninsula.\nThe current Academy City, Neo Seoul.\nThough, the true intentions of the Golden Sheep were unknown.\n─ ‘I want to see the sea, which is no longer beautiful, with my own eyes.’\nThe penalty for necromancy was becoming a revenant, wasn’t it?\nIf Han Seo-jin was freely roaming the outside world separated from her body,\nwas she witnessing such sea landscapes?\nWhat kind of scene would the sea show Han Seo-jin?\nHad she managed to glimpse the old beauty of the sea even a little?\nIt was something I couldn’t know.\n* * *\nAhn Woo-jin unwrapped his bandages.\nThanks to the healer’s recovery magic, his injuries healed in about a week.\nAfter being informed by the healer that his state of magic depletion would recover by early dawn the next day,\nhe exercised intensively at home, having rested sufficiently. Fortunately, it was the weekend tomorrow.\n“Whew.”\nAfter exercising, showering, and enjoying the pleasant muscle soreness, Woo-jin drifted off to sleep.\nIn the dark dawn,\nas Woo-jin’s magic circuits recovered, the dormant magic began to return.\nCrack!\nA crack appeared in the air.\nFrom it, a long, white, bare leg extended gracefully.\nA girl emerged from the crack, her long golden hair fluttering as she landed barefoot.\nEven in the dark night, the girl emitted a soft glow, displaying an elegant figure. Once the crack disappeared, the light flowing through her body faded.\nThe girl, who had her eyes closed, lifted her eyelids, adorned with light golden eyelashes.\nShe gazed at the sleeping Woo-jin.\n“…He recovers slowly.”\nThe girl muttered, taking a deep breath of the room’s air.\nShe slipped under the blanket covering Woo-jin and hugged him as she fell asleep.",

      "content": "Chapter 45 – Rule 19. The Leader Tests His Unique Ability (2)\nOutside the world of Neo Seoul.\nBright lava flowed in the blackened world.\nAt a certain point,\nGoliath was soaking his naked body in the bubbling red lava. It was over ten times hotter than boiling water.\nGoliath leaned back, spreading his broad shoulders, savoring the lava. His large teeth showed as he grinned.\n[Hey.]\nBehind Goliath, a bipedal monster with the head of a goat approached and spoke.\nA muscular creature with long golden wool.\nIt was known as the ‘Other Golden Sheep.’\nIn a voice similar to a human male, it asked calmly.\n[Don’t you get tired of enjoying hot springs here every time? Don’t you want to enjoy hot springs in just plain hot water?]\n“Nothing else satisfies me. Hot springs with lava itself are what I like…!”\nInstead of enjoying hot springs heated by magma, Goliath’s hobby was to soak directly in the erupting lava.\nThe sky was covered with volcanic ash.\nWhen he raised his arms above the blackened lava, flames would surge up.\nGoliath liked this sensation.\nThere was the occasional problem of intruders trying to kill him, but he would simply crush them with his magic.\nSuddenly, Goliath’s gaze shifted to the volcano’s crater.\nA gigantic turtle, whose shell was the volcano itself, stood as a gatekeeper, displaying its overwhelming presence.\nFrom some point on, the volcanic turtle accepted Goliath as a guest enjoying the lava hot springs and allowed him to invade its territory.\n[Fine. I’m not interested in your tastes. Can we now talk about ‘that matter’?]\nUntil recently, Goliath had been living excitedly, running across the sea or defeating monsters.\nSo the Golden Sheep could finally bring up the topic it had hesitated to discuss.\n“Ahn Woo-jin?”\n[Yes. What are you planning to do about the one chosen by the ‘Golden Sheep of Space’?]\n“…I was getting bored.”\nHis deep voice, like the growl of a tiger, echoed in the lava hot spring.\n“Finally, something interesting has come up! I should have some fun…!”\nGoliath grinned widely, pointing his finger upwards at the Golden Sheep.\n“I will watch him! And! Wait for the fight until he’s ripe! That is my perfect plan…!”\nGoliath’s golden eyes burned with a competitive spirit.\n[Perfect plan indeed….]\nThe Golden Sheep sighed silently.\nGoliath was a man who hated using his brain.\nGiven his exceptional combat abilities, he rarely needed to think. After all, if the body is strong, the mind can be at ease.\nHowever, when it came to a ‘plan,’ Goliath was serious. Serious enough to use his brain.\nSo the Golden Sheep didn’t want to argue with Goliath’s ‘perfect plan.’\n[As expected of you….]\nThe Other Golden Sheep.\nThe Golden Sheep of Space had chosen Ahn Woo-jin.\nThere were entities derived from the Golden Sheep.\nOne of them was itself.\nAnd another, the Golden Sheep of Space.\nIt was superior to itself, essentially a true avatar of the Golden Sheep.\nUltimately, Ahn Woo-jin, who received authority from the Golden Sheep of Space, would threaten Goliath’s title of ‘strongest.’\nYet, Goliath had no intention of crushing Ahn Woo-jin’s potential.\nThe title of strongest meant nothing to Goliath.\nHe just… like a child growing their first plant, looked forward to Ahn Woo-jin’s growth, hoping he would ‘grow well!’\nDespite the Golden Sheep granting its authority to Goliath, it still couldn’t fully understand him.\n“My body itches…!”\nGoliath eventually left the lava hot spring.\nWhen his bare feet touched the blackened lava, it sizzled, emitting heat and flames.\nAs he shook off the lava clinging to him, his massive, muscular body was fully revealed.\n“Prepare yourself, Golden Sheep!”\nGoliath shouted boldly.\n“I need trash to alleviate this boredom until Ahn Woo-jin grows stronger…!”\n[Put on some clothes first.]\n“I don’t need them!”\nGoliath ran around the volcano naked, defeating lava monsters with his bare fists.\nHowever, he didn’t touch the volcano’s guardian, the volcanic turtle, as they had become friends.\n* * *\nIn my dream, a girl I’d never seen approached and hugged me. I felt warmth.\nAt that moment, I realized.\nThis was a dream.\nA wet dream?\nNo, it felt different.\nSuddenly, Oh Baek-seo appeared beside me, exuding a murderous aura, asking who the girl was.\nI quickly answered that I didn’t know her.\n“Really don’t know…. Oh?”\nThe constant stream of excuses finally brought my consciousness back from the dream to reality.\nWeak sunlight filtered through the window, illuminating the room. The sun had not fully risen yet, leaving a lingering twilight.\nToday was the weekend.\nDespite that, I woke up quite early.\n“Hmm?”\nMy body felt uncomfortable, as if something was binding me.\nAlthough I woke up from the dream, my body still felt warm.\nI felt a soft, embarrassing sensation pressing against my body.\nI turned my head to the side.\n“…Sss.”\n“…….”\nFor some reason….\nA girl with long golden hair and a white dress was hugging me, breathing softly in her sleep.\nI stopped breathing for a while.\nA storm of intense confusion swept through my mind, causing me to forget how to breathe.\nEventually, I regained my composure.\n‘Who is she!?’\nCrash!\nI quickly got out of bed and warily eyed the golden-haired girl. Fortunately, a black short staff was nearby.\nSwish! I swung the staff, extending the rod made of the Iron Dragon’s armor inside. It was the Iron Dragon Rod.\n“Who are you?”\nI asked in a threatening tone typical of the Disciplinary Committee, keeping a poker face.\n“…A noisy teddy bear in the morning.”\nThe girl spoke in an elegant tone like an old person, despite having a noble voice.\nDid she treat me like a teddy bear and sleep while hugging me?\n“Yawn.”\nThe girl sat up and yawned leisurely.\nShe looked at me with golden eyes.\n“…An intruder?”\nOur living area was especially monitored by numerous security robots, and in addition, Baek-seo and I had our security drones patrolling.\nIf an intruder appeared, the alarm would have sounded loudly.\nBut.\n‘The alarm didn’t go off.’\nIt was quiet.",

You’re an ungrateful one.”\nThe girl clicked her tongue, shook her head, and shrugged her shoulders.\nI couldn’t understand what favor I owed her.\n“Well, let’s talk about that later. I need more sleep. Proper sleep is essential for good skin care, you know?”\n“……?”\nThe girl babbled nonsense and then slipped back under the blanket, taking the spot where I had been lying.\nWith a unique exclamation reminiscent of a sheep’s bleat, her expression melted with satisfaction.\n“Baa… It’s warm since you heated it up…. It’s heavenly….”\n…Is she kidding?\n“Get up.”\nMy voice was icy.\nMagic stirred.\nIt seemed my magic circuits had fully recovered while I was asleep.\nI decided to deal firmly with the uninvited guest.\nSizzle!\nGreen-blue lightning magic sparked on the Iron Dragon Rod.\n“If you stay put until I count to three, I will consider it a trespass and execute a citizen’s arrest.”\n“…….”\n“One.”\n“…….”\n“Two.”\n“Grr, you’re a troublesome one! I’ll come out, jeez…!”\nSensing my aggressive magic, the girl hastily got out from under the blanket, her tone becoming childish as she abandoned her elderly speech pattern.\nShe stood facing me.\n“Look.”\nWith a stern face, the girl extended her index finger upwards.\nThen, there was a cracking sound as something that shouldn’t split, split.\nWhirr.\nAn alien-like gate formed in the air above the girl’s index finger.\n“What?”\nI was stunned.\nIt was unmistakably my unique ability. The sensation of magic felt the same.\nIt was undoubtedly the space ability I had used.\n“I am a wanderer from another dimension. The owner of your ability. The one who bestowed the power upon you.”\nThe girl said grandly, stringing together impressive titles, though her golden hair was disheveled, making her look unimpressive.\n“And using your terms, I am another ‘Golden Sheep.’”\nSizzle….\nThe lightning magic on the Iron Dragon Rod faded away.\nFor now….\n“…I’ll ask for confirmation.”\n“Go ahead.”\n“Are you perhaps delusional?”\n“I don’t suffer from delusions…. You! After seeing this, do you still think I’m a fool!?”\nThe girl’s face turned red with indignation.\n……\nAfter listening to the girl’s story,\n“To summarize…, you are another Golden Sheep born from the original Golden Sheep.”\n“Correct.”\n“And while staying in another dimension, you could come to this world because I awakened my unique ability?”\n“Precisely.”\nBy then, the girl was munching on some potato chips she had found somewhere.\n“To be exact, your unique ability originates from my authority. I chose you. Originally, unique abilities develop postnatally.”\n…What?\n“Did I just hear a secret of this world nonchalantly?”\n“Don’t be silly. It’s common knowledge, isn’t it?”\nThe girl answered nonchalantly.\nNo, seriously.\nWas she saying that unique abilities develop postnatally, not innately?\nIt was a statement that could upend academic theories.\n“Well, be happy. I, the great one, chose you.”\nWith an arrogant tone,\nthe girl, who hadn’t bothered to tidy her disheveled hair, continued eating potato chips.\nWhether unique abilities developed innately or postnatally wasn’t something to dwell on right now.\nSo, moving on.\n“…Why did you choose me?”\nI crossed my arms, leaned against the wall, and looked at the girl.\nMeanwhile, I tried to evoke the crack she had formed but still felt nothing.\n“Because your magic was exceptionally pure. It was the most enchanting among anyone in this world. Only with such pure magic could you use space abilities.”\nI had trained in Goliath’s magic cultivation method, practicing even more diligently than he had as a child. Thanks to that, my magic was nearly 100% purified.\n“I was drawn to you from the start and chose you.”\nThe girl pointed at me with her crumb-covered finger, her face full of pride, expecting me to be impressed.\n“So, I bestowed my authority upon you, stuck by your side, and waited for you to reach at least a basic level…!”\nHer voice held a refined grandiosity that didn’t match her sharp cat-like eyes.\n“…Like a stalker?”\n“I warn you. If you call me that nonsense title again, it will not end well.”\nThe girl replied smoothly and eloquently, in a firm tone.\nIgnoring her.\n“Does that mean the original Golden Sheep could intervene in living beings’ unique abilities?”\n“You could think of it that way. Though the original one doesn’t seem interested in such matters.”\n“Is there anyone else with a similar case?”\n“There’s one more. The one who invaded my space last time.”\nShe was referring to Goliath.\nIt was the incident when the Blessing of the Golden Sheep manifested.\n“That guy also has another Golden Sheep. We each have our authority and exist individually. Though not as capable as me.”\nThe girl licked the chip seasoning off her fingers, created a crack in the air, and threw the chip bag inside.\nSo my unique ability could be used as a trash bin too.\nIt seemed to have limitless, albeit trivial, uses.\n“Anyway, the one who chose that guy has the appearance of a goat monster.”\nThe girl mimicked goat horns with her hands on either side of her head.\n“If I were to be born as a human, why choose such a monstrous appearance? Tsk….”\nSo, the one who granted Goliath his unique ability was another Golden Sheep derived from the original.\nAnd they existed as separate entities with their own bodies, lives, and souls.\n‘Is that why his ability was called the Blessing of the Golden Sheep?’\nIf Goliath could converse with his unique ability’s owner like I could now,\nit made sense how he could explain the Blessing of the Golden Sheep.\n‘In the game, I thought it was just a figurative expression.’\nI thought it was a term used to elevate the prestige of Goliath, the strongest in the game,\nby attributing his ability to the divine Golden Sheep, like ‘Zeus’s Lightning’ or ‘Prometheus’s Fire.’\n‘It was a literal blessing from the Golden Sheep.’\nIt was exactly as stated.\n“And just to clarify.”\nThe girl approached me and looked up at me.\nShe was much shorter than Baek-seo.\nAbout 140 cm, maybe close to 150 cm.\nHer golden hair was still disheveled.\n“Don’t ask me about the hole or the Golden Sheep’s will.”\n“Why?”\n“I was born after the Golden Sheep passed through ‘The Hole,’ and we are now separate entities. I know almost nothing. But I can say this for sure.”\nThe girl grabbed my wrist and lifted it, opening my palm and supporting my hand.\nSss.\n‘Huh?’\nA profound sensation washed over me like a tsunami, enveloping my entire body.\nThe sensation coursed through my magic circuits and eventually surged up to my palm.\nCrack!\n“!”\nAbove our palms, a crack appeared in the air.\nThe crack was dark and mysterious.\nIt looked dangerous, as if it shouldn’t be touched, yet it radiated an enchanting light.\nThe girl smiled and said,\n“I will grant you the power to control space.”\nAt that moment, I realized the true nature of my ability.\nUnique Ability: Space Domination.\nThe basic ability was to connect spaces at will.\nMy eyes widened, and my lips curled up slightly.\nI had been unable to use my unique ability and had been frustrated by the lack of sensation, but now I felt pure joy.\n“…That’s cool.”\nRealizing that I had awakened a new power, a wave of delight finally hit me.",

The Leader Tests His Unique Ability (3)\n“Good reaction.”\nThe girl nodded with a satisfied expression.\nI couldn’t help but be delighted.\nAfter all, I had finally obtained the unique ability I had long desired.\n“What’s your name?”\nI asked, looking at the girl.\nHer long golden hair fluttered in the gentle breeze created by the crack.\nSince it seemed like we would be seeing each other often, it was better to exchange names.\n“I don’t have a name.”\n“You don’t?”\n“Hmm, maybe I should come up with one now….”\nThe girl stroked her chin thoughtfully, then spoke as if she had an idea.\n“Since I’m a Golden Sheep…”\nWith a flourish, she tossed her hair over her shoulder and placed her thumb and index finger under her chin.\n“Call me ‘Geumyang’!”\nShe said this with a confident smile and a glint of pride in her eyes.\nShe seemed very pleased with the name, thinking her sense of naming was excellent.\n‘Geumyang…’\n“Why the face?”\n“The name is a bit…”\nI couldn’t bring myself to say it was corny.\nGeumyang glared at me with sharp eyes.\n“You dare not understand the supreme naming sense of mine…?”\n“The name feels strong and charismatic. It’s pretty good.”\n“Hmm?”\n“The more I think about it, the better it sounds.”\n“Oh.”\nI couldn’t argue with her about a name she liked.\nAs I uttered a white lie, Geumyang’s face gradually brightened.\nShe wiped under her nose with her finger, nodding in satisfaction.\n“Hmm… You do know something.”\nGeumyang puffed up with pride.\nIt was clear that despite her grandiosity, she carried no real weight.\n“Alright, then.”\nAs Geumyang removed her hand from mine, the crack condensed into a line and vanished.\nAt the same time, the sensation of activating my unique ability faded away completely.\n“Did the sensation disappear…?”\nThe feeling of having something and then losing it was disconcerting.\n“You may have reached the minimum threshold, but you overused your spatial abilities right from the start. That likely caused severe side effects. It’s not surprising the sensation vanished.”\n“So I lacked the capacity?”\n“Yes, it’s proof that you haven’t yet grown enough to properly use spatial abilities.”\nThat was something I hadn’t considered.\n“Anyway, my unique ability is still intact?”\n“Of course.”\nHer clear answer eased my concerns.\nI could finally be at peace.\n“By the way…, kiddo? I have a question.”\n‘Kiddo?’\nThinking about it, if Geumyang’s story was true, she was much older than me.\nI decided not to argue.\n“What is it?”\n“Ahem!”\nGeumyang covered her mouth with her fist and cleared her throat.\n“Well…”\nShe put a hand to her mouth and cautiously asked,\n“Did Luffy become the Pirate King…?”\nLuffy?\nOh.\n“You mean One Piece?”\n“Yes, that’s it!”\nOne Piece.\nThe manga about a man named Luffy on his journey to become the Pirate King.\n“It was discontinued.”\n“What?”\n“The world went to hell. The author’s whereabouts are unknown now. It’s an old story.”\nI shrugged as I answered.\nA brief silence followed.\nThud. Geumyang slumped to the ground.\nHer face showed utter despair.\n“So this is what despair feels like….”\nAn existence some called a god.\nThe Golden Sheep tasted despair for the first time.\n……\nTo test my unique ability, we decided to move to another location.\nGeumyang and I headed to a training facility in Neo Seoul. It was a commercial establishment where you could rent a spacious private training room, ensuring privacy.\nOriginally, Geumyang said she could traverse spaces and move to the training facility instantly.\nBut she wanted to explore Neo Seoul, so we walked along the roads. Since it had been a while since she set foot in this world, I understood.\nGeumyang’s usual attire was a white dress, so I lent her my clothes. Because of our size difference, she ended up wearing an oversized coat, which draped loosely down to her elbows.\nShe couldn’t even wear my pants as they didn’t fit.\n“I wanted to wear a uniform too…”\nShe muttered wistfully, glancing at me.\nWas she asking me to buy her a uniform?\n“We can talk about that later.”\nI didn’t have the funds for it at the moment. Besides, I was eager to test my unique ability.\nWe arrived at the training facility and rented a private training room.\nIt was quite spacious.\nIt seemed to be worth the price.\nSince it was my first time here, I didn’t expect it to be this good.\nIn the center of the training room.\nGeumyang and I stood facing each other closely.\n“Come to think of it, you said you’ve been sticking around me?”\n“Yes.”\n“Have you been watching my every move?”\nI asked while checking the state of the Iron Dragon Staff.\nIf what Geumyang said was true, she might have been spying on my entire private life.\n“Yes. From when you were little, being held by a robot. I was watching only you.”\nHmm.\nI see.",

      "content": "Chapter 46 (Continued)\nThat’s a long time….\n“Well, then. If there’s nothing special, let’s quickly test my unique ability….”\n“If you’re worried about me finding videos of older women in mating boxes, don’t worry. I’ve long realized that such things cause strong embarrassment when spoken aloud.”\n“I want to die.”\nSomeone please strangle me.\nAny image I had built was meaningless in front of Geumyang from the start.\n“You mustn’t die. Now, then.”\nGeumyang chuckled and extended her hand to me.\n“Kiddo, give me your hand.”\n“?”\nWhat kind of treatment is this…?\n“You’re experiencing side effects now, so you can’t use your unique ability. You need to hold my hand to use it like before.”\nShe seemed to be referring to the time when she made a crack appear over my hand, saying she would let me control space.\n“Any physical contact will do, but hands are the most convenient.”\n“When will these side effects go away?”\n“Usually within a day. But you’ve been in a state of magic depletion recently, haven’t you?”\n“When magic is depleted, does it prevent side effects from recovering too?”\nGeumyang nodded.\n“Most problems related to magic work that way. The reason I couldn’t appear before was because you were in that state.”\nSo at least for today, I had to touch her to use my unique ability through her.\nI quietly extended my hand and took Geumyang’s hand. It was smooth and small.\nA question suddenly came to mind.\n“Wait. Then not being able to use my unique ability now isn’t a penalty?”\n“That’s already passed. You just couldn’t feel it because you were in a state of magic depletion.”\n“?”\nIt’s already passed?\n“Penalties from spatial abilities affect the magic circuits.”\n“So if I’m in a state of magic depletion, I won’t experience the penalties?”\n“No, the penalties accumulate until you experience them. When your magic returns, you will fully experience the accumulated penalties.”\n“Then?”\n“I transferred the penalties you were supposed to endure to myself. Do you think I hugged you for no reason?”\nTransferred the penalties.\nIn other words, Geumyang absorbed the penalties I was supposed to experience through the act of hugging.\nSo, touching Geumyang is the condition for transferring penalties?\n“And, the spatial ability is originally my authority! I don’t experience penalties!”\n“Then what exactly is my penalty?”\n“Well, your unique ability will return tomorrow, so you’ll experience it then. I’m sure you won’t be able to resist seeking my embrace.”\nI wasn’t sure what the penalty was exactly, but…\n‘Will it hurt terribly?’\nA sense of foreboding crept over me.\nAt that moment,\nSss.\n‘Oh, it works.’\nOnce again, I felt the sensation of my unique ability flowing through me. Raising my hand to control it, a crack formed in the air with a ‘crack.’\nWhirr.\nA gentle, warm breeze flowed from the crack, ruffling mine and Geumyang’s hair.\n“By the way, I should mention.”\n“What?”\n“I can no longer exert significant power in this world. I have already transferred my authority to you. I can only fully utilize my abilities in my labyrinth, beyond space.”\nIn short, Geumyang was saying she was weak in this world.\n“Keep that in mind. Today’s training is not your full power.”\n“Got it.”\nAfter that, Geumyang taught me the first form of the unique ability, Space Control.\n‘Spatial Leap.’\nIt involved creating a crack that linked two points.\nBy crossing the crack, you could move to the other side.\n‘I can’t get the hang of this.’\nIt was incredibly difficult to precisely set the location where the crack would appear.\n‘Geumyang called it ‘coordinate setting.’\nAs a result, I kept leaping to unintended locations instead of the designated ones.\nSometimes, I even ended up outside the training facility.\nGeumyang explained that the feeling of setting coordinates and leaping would become more proficient the more I used the magic formula.\nSweat poured down my body like rain. Setting coordinates, creating cracks, and leaping through them was not just challenging but also painful.\nIt felt like using muscles I had never used before at the gym for the first time.\nThus, I practiced spatial leaping repeatedly within the training room.\nSweat also flowed from my hand, clasped with Geumyang’s.\nHowever, rather than letting go of the slippery hand, Geumyang interlocked her fingers with mine, ensuring a firmer grip. She didn’t want my concentration to break.\nAfter a day of holding hands and training, the sky beyond the window had turned dark.\n“Huff, huff….”\nAs I collapsed to the floor, panting heavily, Geumyang let go of my hand. The sensation of the spatial ability flowing through my body vanished as if a light had been turned off.\nGeumyang sat on my abdomen, her weight providing a moderate sense of pressure.\n“Are you exhausted?”\n“A little rest should do…”\nUnder the light, Geumyang’s sharp eyes looked down at me.\nAmused by my exhausted state, her face carried a subtle smile.\n“Why are you laughing?”\n“Because you look quite funny collapsed like that.”\n“……”\nWas she teasing me?\nGeumyang turned her head forward and closed her eyes with a smile.\n“Well, that’s enough for today.”\n“I could do this all day.”\n“Rest for now. You can train properly with your own abilities tomorrow. Excessive use of magic today isn’t a wise choice.”\n“…I suppose you’re right.”\nIndeed.\nUsing my abilities directly without relying on Geumyang would yield better results.\nSo.\n‘It’s better to train properly tomorrow. Holding her hand all the time is a bit awkward anyway.’\nI propped myself up on my elbows and slowly raised my upper body. As my balance shifted, Geumyang opened her eyes and looked down at me.\n“Are you getting up?”\n“How about we get some dinner?”\n“Dinner… I don’t have any particular cravings. But yes, proper nutrition and energy intake are essential. Let’s go.”\nGeumyang replied indifferently.\n‘Does she not have much of an appetite?’\nThat question vanished once we ordered udon at the restaurant.\n“What heavenly taste is this…!”\n“It’s just regular udon.”\n“This is the first time I’ve tasted something so delicious in my life!! How is this flavor so exquisitely savory?”\nGeumyang’s eyes sparkled, and her cheeks flushed as she got excited.\nWhen Geumyang arrived in this world, it was after the Pacific Hole had formed and before Neo Seoul was established.\nShe had likely only had snacks and simple foods.\nShe had probably never tasted proper cooking.\nHence, her reaction was unexpectedly intense.\n‘Thank goodness there are no other customers.’\nIt was late, so we were the only ones in the restaurant.\nWatching Geumyang’s enthusiastic reaction to the udon, I couldn’t help but smile.\nAh, she really is from another world.\n“This crispy exterior and juicy inside… What is this fierce dish!?”\n“Ah… that is called ‘chicken’.”\n“Chicken…!”\nThe owner, sensing Geumyang’s intense reaction, answered with a smile.\nThe owner had dropped out of the academy and opened a restaurant, becoming an adult last year. He seemed to think Geumyang’s expression of ‘chicken being delicious’ was her way of complimenting him.\n‘Is this her first time eating chicken?’\nFrom our earlier conversation, it seemed Geumyang had never eaten cooked food. Naturally, she had never tasted freshly fried chicken.\nFinally, after trying all the side dishes, Geumyang closed her eyes, savoring the pleasant aftertaste.\n“This is what happiness feels like…. I am happy to be in this world….”\nLeaning back in her chair, patting her stomach contentedly, Geumyang smiled, her body seeming to melt like slime.\nIn the morning, her prickly personality had been troubling, but now she seemed endearing.\n“Let’s head back if you’re done eating.”\n“Indeed. I look forward to tomorrow….”\nShe seemed to be eagerly anticipating what she would eat tomorrow.\nWe went into an alley, and Geumyang created a crack to transport us directly to my room.\n‘These abilities are amazing.’\nGeumyang said goodbye and disappeared into space.\nMaybe because I was so exhausted,\nI fell asleep immediately after washing up.\n* * *\nThe next day.\nTraining facility.\n“Argh!!”\nAs a result of overusing my spatial control, I experienced excruciating pain as if my magic circuits were burning.\nHowever, when Geumyang slipped into my arms and hugged me, the pain from the penalty miraculously subsided rapidly.\n______________\nRate us on\nNovel Updates\nto motivate me translate more chapters.",

      "content": "Chapter 47 – Rule 19. The Leader Tests His Unique Ability (4)\nA few hours before experiencing the penalty.\nWe rented the training room again.\n“Alright, let’s continue from yesterday!”\nGeumyang placed her hands on her hips and puffed out her chest, shouting confidently. She was still wearing the oversized coat she borrowed from me, which hung loosely down to her elbows.\nCrack!\nGeumyang created a crack in the air.\nThe gentle breeze from the crack softly ruffled her golden hair.\n“This crack only allows inanimate objects to pass through. Only those with the Golden Sheep’s authority can pass through it if they are living beings. If you were thinking of trapping enemies in isolated spaces, it won’t work.”\n“I see. That’s unfortunate…”\nSo, the reason Goliath’s fist passed through the crack was because he had the Golden Sheep’s authority.\nIt wouldn’t be possible to use this ability for a cheap win against other enemies.\n“And as you might have guessed, you’re currently a makeshift ‘Tier 6’.”\nGeumyang pointed at me.\n“You have the skills to reach Tier 6, but because of your unique ability, it took quite a while.”\nI had already realized this during my battle with Han Seo-jin.\nAt that time, I used both my unique ability and elemental power in synergy.\nThat was a Tier 6 technique.\n“I can feel it.”\nSince yesterday, I’ve felt it.\nMy body now overflowed with more magic than ever before.\nIt was as if the blockage had been cleared as soon as my unique ability blossomed.\nA torrent of magic began to surge through my magic circuits.\nAt this rate, I could expect faster growth compared to others. Like a cheetah entering a race and overtaking all the other competitors despite a late start.\nHowever,\n“I’m still not sure about Tier 6. Shouldn’t I be able to spew elemental power like a fountain at that level?”\nBy Tier 6, one should be able to release elemental power at will without the need for a magic tool.\nBut I could only release a small amount of elemental power. It seemed too trivial for a Tier 6.\n“That’s why I said you’re a makeshift Tier 6, kid.”\nGeumyang folded her arms and smirked arrogantly.\n“From ‘kiddo’ to ‘kid’ now, huh…”\n“‘Kiddo’ seemed too dismissive. If you put in the effort, your titles might evolve too, so keep striving.”\nObviously, I didn’t have much desire for those titles.\n“Anyway, you’re already at the threshold. It means you can use elemental power alongside your spatial ability!”\n“I have a question. I once used ‘Spatial Leap’ to amplify my lightning power.”\nIt was when I blocked Han Seo-jin’s necromancy, Requiem.\nAt that time, I created a crack in the air and unleashed a powerful lightning bolt.\n“I managed to do it instinctively in the heat of the moment… How can I do that again?”\n“There’s no need for an explanation. You’ll figure it out when you try it yourself today.”\nGeumyang answered nonchalantly.\n“Really?”\nWell, if she says so.\nLet’s try it.\n“Alright, let’s get started! Go ahead.”\nAfter a full night’s sleep, the sensation from my battle with Han Seo-jin began to wrap around my magic circuits again.\nIt was different from simply feeling in good condition. It felt like I had acquired a new body.\n‘I feel light.’\nTo use a common metaphor, it felt like I could fly.\nMore clearly than yesterday, I realized I had ascended to a higher level.\n“Phew.”\nI took a deep breath, closed my eyes, and focused on the mystical sensation flowing within me.\nMy lower abdomen roared fiercely, and my magic circuits carried magic more vigorously than usual.\nI channeled the magic according to my will and released it forward, not as lightning magic.\nCrack!\nA crack appeared before me, forming a mysterious gate.\n“Oh.”\nAn involuntary exclamation escaped my lips.\nUnique Ability: Space Domination.\nMagic Formula Form 1: Spatial Leap.\nUniquely, Space Domination varied in its usage conditions depending on the magic formula, and Magic Formula Form 1 had no particular trigger.\nI could simply create a crack whenever I wanted.\nAs I stepped into the gate, nothing solid met my foot. I threw myself forward.\nMy body floated weightlessly, and my vision was filled with an endless corridor of an otherworldly hue.\nThe surroundings were entirely the color of a dark blue night sky.\nI could also see black streams flowing like currents along the strange walls.\n─ ‘The space between cracks created by Spatial Leap is a wormhole.’\nI recalled what Geumyang said yesterday.\nThis was the wormhole created by my ability.\n─ ‘Never stay there longer than necessary. You will lose your senses first, and then you will lose yourself.’\nGeumyang had warned me sternly. This wormhole was quite dangerous.\nHowever,\n‘Something feels different from yesterday.’\nPerhaps because I was now using my ability entirely on my own.\nIt felt completely different from the countless times I passed through the wormhole yesterday.\n‘I can sense the magic. I couldn’t feel it yesterday.’\nThe magic circulating in the wormhole felt strangely like my own.\nSizzle!\nFor an experiment, I extended my finger and conjured lightning magic.\nIt was a simple technique made possible after reaching Tier 6.\nAt that moment.\nCrack!\n“!”\nA streak of green-blue current extended and ran along the circular wall of the wormhole, absorbing the black currents like small fish caught in a whirlpool.\nHowever, it gradually grew larger, absorbing the black currents—no, the magic.\nEventually, the green-blue lightning, now containing the black light, grew to the size of my body.\nIt reached its limit and ceased expanding.\nThe enlarged lightning magic shot around wildly, imprinting flashes in my vision, and finally condensed into a point, stabilizing.\nThe lightning magic eventually became a sphere, floating around.\n‘So that’s how it was.’\nI understood why my lightning magic had amplified during my fight with Han Seo-jin.\nWhoooom!\n‘Ah.’\nSuddenly, a chilling sensation ran down my spine, pulling me into fear.\nMy survival instinct screamed that I needed to get out of here immediately.\n‘Let’s get out.’\nI set a coordinate at the desired point (though it wasn’t exactly where I intended), creating another crack.\nCrack!\nWhirr.\nA crack formed somewhere in the wormhole.\nInstantly, the lightning magic floating in the air was sucked into the new crack, like air moving from high pressure to low pressure.\nBoom!!\nA deafening roar echoed as the lightning magic surged through the new crack.\n‘Wait…!’\nMy heart sank. I might have created a crack in the wrong place and caused unintended harm.\nI swam swiftly through the air and passed through the new crack.\nI arrived at a point in the training room.\nHowever, it was quite high up.\n“Whoa!”\nWhirr!\nMy body fell straight to the ground.\nThud!\nI had hastily reinforced my body with magic to minimize the impact, but I still felt like my insides had been shaken up.\n“Phew…”\nI wiped the cold sweat from my brow and raised my upper body.\nI looked down.\nRight in front of me was a scorch mark on the ground, roughly the size of a person, with smoke rising from it. Luckily, no one was there.\nSoon, the crack I had created closed.\nSo, this is how it feels…\n“Kid.”\nGeumyang approached and crouched down in front of me, meeting my gaze. Her sharp eyes and haughty expression focused on me.\nGiven Geumyang’s height, I wasn’t sure who the real “kid” was here…\n‘Careless.’\nHer smooth legs and surprisingly large chest, pressed against her thighs, made their presence known.\nShe wore the oversized coat loosely and had no pants on.",

      "content": "Chapter 47 (Continued)\nMy eyes, maintaining gentlemanly manners, shifted to the side to avoid staring directly at her.\n“Now you understand how to apply elemental magic?”\n“Yeah… I can use the magic within the wormhole.”\n“Yes, that’s the application of the wormhole. Magic amplification. The lightning strike you performed using the crack is your own technique, so it’s best to name it.”\nHuh?\nMy eyes turned to Geumyang’s golden eyes.\n“Is there no established magic formula for this?”\n“Well, attaching names is just part of defining the concept systematically. Magic formulas are something humans invented to establish a systematic understanding, aren’t they?”\n“That’s true.”\nEven Baek-seo attached her own techniques to magic formulas.\nIn this world, many people share similar unique abilities.\nIn such cases, they mostly follow already established magic formulas.\nBut if there’s no such concept, I could create my own magic formula.\n‘…This is exciting.’\nThe idea of naming my new technique myself.\nAs a man, my heart pulsed with excitement.\n“Heh, are you excited over something like this? You really are a kid.”\n“What?”\nGeumyang glared at me with an odd smile.\nDid I fail to keep my expression neutral?\nI thought I was being careful.\n“Was it obvious on my face?”\nI shrugged and asked honestly. There was nothing to hide from Geumyang, who had been watching me all along.\nGeumyang shook her head.\n“Not really. I’ve just watched you for so long that I can tell. Can you distinguish the expressions of a lizard you see for the first time?”\nGeumyang shrugged and answered calmly.\n“……”\nNow it was my turn to glare at Geumyang.\nWhy compare herself to a lizard when she had a human body?\nHer arrogance was palpable.\n“Let’s continue. We’ll review what we did yesterday.”\nAs Geumyang stood up and extended her hand, I took it and stood up. She then distanced herself from me.\nUnlike yesterday, now that I was using my unique ability directly, the sensation of Spatial Leap felt much clearer.\nRecalling the lightning strike I had performed earlier fueled my enthusiasm.\n‘Alright, let’s do this.’\nWith an uncontrollable smile at the corners of my mouth, I channeled my bubbling enthusiasm into practice.\nA few hours later.\nIt was evening.\n“Uh…?”\nSuddenly, I felt screwed.\nAn urgent sensation like a cramp shot up my spine.\n“Urgh!”\nThe magic I was wielding abruptly subsided, and intense pain erupted in my magic circuits.\nIt wasn’t a fleeting pain.\nIt didn’t stop.\n“Grrr…!”\nI curled up and clenched my teeth.\nInstinctively, I knew.\nThis was the penalty.\nHaving repeatedly used Spatial Leap, the penalty had finally hit.\nThe sensation of my insides burning and an unbearable scream escaped me. It felt like I might die from the pain.\nPowerful unique abilities come with equally powerful penalties.\nIf the usage conditions of a unique ability are stringent, the penalties are mitigated, but since my ability had no specific conditions…\n“Arghhhh!”\nI couldn’t maintain my sanity.\nBut my consciousness remained sharp, fully registering the pain, as if cheering me on, saying, “You can endure this!” It was infuriating.\nAs I writhed in agony, unable to speak, Geumyang suddenly approached and hugged me.\nWrapping her arms around my waist, she closed her eyes and held me tight.\n“What…?”\nThe pain subsided dramatically.\nAs if the hellish torment moments ago had been a lie, the pain vanished completely.\n“Are you feeling better?”\nGeumyang’s elegant voice echoed from my embrace.\n“Yeah… I suddenly feel okay.”\n“Remember, that pain is the cost of using your ability.”\nWith her chin resting on my chest, Geumyang looked up at me and spoke softly. Her squished cheeks made her look like a hamster.\nA different kind of cuteness contrasted with her usual arrogant and sharp-eyed demeanor.\n“When the magic circuits fail to handle the overload, they rebel. When magic flows through them, it causes excruciating pain, like being stabbed at a cellular level or set on fire. As long as you’re human, you can’t escape this price.”\nI finally understood the part of her explanation from yesterday that I hadn’t comprehended.\nThe favor I owed Geumyang.\nIt seemed to be her taking on my penalty when my magic circuits recovered.\n“When you hug me, the penalty transfers to you?”\nI asked, looking down at her to confirm.\n“That’s right. Specifically, as long as we’re in close contact, the pain disappears. For minor penalties, simple physical contact is enough to alleviate the pain. So, don’t worry.”\nEventually, Geumyang moved away from me.\nThe pain had completely disappeared.\n‘So, without her, I’d have to endure hellish pain.’\nSweat trickled down my cheek.\nThe pain earlier wasn’t something I could endure with sheer willpower.\nOf course, if I somehow endured it, the penalty might pass safely, but the thought of enduring such pain was unthinkable.\nIt would undoubtedly take a mental toll.\n“Phew…”\nThud.\nAlthough the pain was gone, I felt drained and collapsed onto the floor, lying down to catch my breath.\nGeumyang sat on my abdomen. Since she wasn’t heavy, I ignored her and stared at the ceiling.\n“You did well, kid. It’s best to rest now. The penalty means you overdid it.”\n“Not just eager for dinner?”\n“You dare think I value dinner over your training?”\nHer response was like reading a textbook.\nShe was transparent.\nI had already informed Baek-seo via messenger that I’d be having dinner out tonight. Time to eat comfortably.\n“Fine. I’m hungry too. Let’s go.”\n“Well, if you insist, let’s go!”\nI took the begrudgingly following Geumyang to a kimchi stew restaurant.\n“This is what happiness feels like…”\nPredictably, Geumyang reacted as expected.\n* * *\nIn the darkened house of Ahn Woo-jin.\nHis neighbor, Oh Baek-seo, unlocked the door and entered.\nTurning on the lights, she found the house empty and quiet.\nBaek-seo placed the pancakes she had made on the kitchen table, covering them with another dish.\n[ I made extra, so I brought some. Eat when you’re hungry ^_^ ]\nLeaving a note on the table, she put various fruits and milk in the fridge, thinking of Woo-jin’s nutrition.\nWoo-jin had mentioned he would be busy this weekend, saying he needed to test his unique ability now that his magic circuits had recovered.\n“Hmm.”\nImagining Woo-jin excited about testing his unique ability made Baek-seo smile.\nAt school this week, Woo-jin had tried to hide his excitement about his unique ability, and seeing that had made Baek-seo smile warmly.\nTo her, Woo-jin was already an adorable man who had surpassed her limits of cuteness.\n“Hmm?”\nJust as Baek-seo was about to leave Woo-jin’s house.\nShe noticed a long hair on the floor and picked it up.\nA strand of light golden hair.\nIt was a woman’s.\n“……”\nThe smile lingering on Baek-seo’s lips slowly faded.\n______________\nRate us on\nNovel Updates\nto motivate me translate more chapters.",

      "content": "Chapter 48 – Rule 20. The Leader Relies on the Vice Leader (1)\nI rode the rift created by Geumyang to my home.\n‘Amazing.’\nI was astonished at how such precise coordinate settings were possible.\nTeleporting from the training ground to my home was still beyond my capabilities. Even short-range teleportation was not something I could do freely.\n“Thank you.”\n“You’re welcome. But kid, I need to wash up.”\nHuh?\n“Didn’t you wash up yesterday?”\n“I have a spring in my labyrinth, so I can wash there. But I prefer to wash with warm water here.”\n“Don’t undress here.”\n“Why not?”\nI firmly stopped Geumyang, who was taking off her top, revealing her slender abdomen.\nIn the end, I had to teach her how to undress and wash in the shower room.\nGeumyang claimed she had learned all this by observing my daily life, clicking her tongue and saying, “You’re a fussy one.”\n“I’ll emphasize it again: don’t expose yourself in front of others.”\n“Ha, you’re something else…”\nGeumyang smirked, closed her eyes, and shrugged her shoulders, seemingly more troubled than I was.\n“I do have that level of common sense. But kid, aren’t we practically one and the same? It shouldn’t matter if I undress in front of you…”\n“Don’t undress in front of me either.”\n“?”\n“I’ll leave new clothes here. Wash up and come out.”\n“Alright, fine. What a bother.”\nPerhaps tired of persuading me, Geumyang reluctantly agreed and went into the shower room.\nAfter washing up, Geumyang came out wearing a white T-shirt. Since it was my shirt, it was oversized, covering her groin with the hem.\n“Whew…”\nShe plopped down on the sofa with a wet towel around her neck.\nThe living room became humid, and the scent of shampoo and body wash wafted from Geumyang.\nShe smiled contentedly as if melting away.\n“I feel refreshed…”\nWhen you look closely, she has her cute moments.\n“I’m going to wash up too.”\n“Hey, come here for a moment.”\n“?”\n“Closer.”\nI approached Geumyang, leaned forward, and bowed my head. She placed her hand on top of my head.\nSsss.\nA gentle magic flowed into me.\nThe fatigue built up in my magic circuits dissipated, bringing a sense of calm.\nIt was like receiving a massage that relieved my body’s fatigue.\n‘Oh, what’s this?’\nWith the fatigue in my magic circuits gone, I felt no resistance to using my magic. It felt like the stiffness had eased.\n“I feel less tired now…”\nI said, rotating my shoulders and expressing my amazement.\nA turquoise current flowed along the back of my hand.\nThe fatigue in my magic circuits was definitely gone.\n“It’s similar to a healing spell. I’ll do it occasionally when you overwork yourself during training.”\n“Thanks, whatever it is.”\n“And.”\nGeumyang pointed at me.\n“From tomorrow, use teleportation to commute to school.”\nA golden glint flashed in her eyes.\n“Setting a small goal in your daily life and using your abilities frequently will help a lot. For example.”\nCrack.\nGeumyang created a small rift in the air and put her arm through it.\nA rift appeared near the table, and her arm reached out and grabbed the remote control.\nSwish! Geumyang pulled her arm out of the rift and closed it. The remote control was now in her hand.\n“Like this. Especially for commuting, setting a destination and using your ability will be very beneficial.”\n“That’s really convenient…”\n“That’s what controlling space is all about.”\nGeumyang answered with a triumphant smile.\n“But you shouldn’t rely too much on your abilities.”\n“Hmm…”\n“Why? Is there a problem?”\nPracticing teleportation was good, but…\n‘Baek-seo is the issue.’\nI often commuted with Baek-seo.\nEven though I had been restraining myself lately due to the rumors among the disciplinary committee members, I still occasionally commuted with her.\n‘Still… mastering my abilities should come first.’\nI didn’t have to commute with her all the time.\nI needed to set my priorities straight.\nWell, I could show Baek-seo my unique ability and explain it to her.\n“I was just thinking about something. I’ll do it.”\n“Good.”\n“By the way, can I introduce you to someone?”\nGeumyang immediately gave me a suspicious look.\n“…Are you talking about Oh Baek-seo?”\n“You figured it out right away.”\nGeumyang was someone I would have to be closely associated with, and she was essentially a ‘female.’ No, fundamentally, she wasn’t an ordinary person, so perhaps I should say a female creature. Anyway.\nI wanted to introduce her to Baek-seo in advance to prevent any misunderstandings or conflicts.\n“I don’t mind, but…”\n“You look like you don’t like it.”\nGeumyang made a distasteful face.\n“Let’s postpone meeting her. I don’t really want to encounter her.”\n“Why?”\n“There are reasons.”\nWhy is that?\nCould it be that she also has some shyness?\nI nodded. It was important to respect the person’s wishes in such matters.\n“Understood. Next time then.”\n“Sure. If there’s nothing else, I’ll be going now.”\nFeeling burdened by the thought of being introduced to someone, Geumyang quickly stood up from the sofa and looked at me.\n“See you tomorrow.”\nShe waved her hand with a graceful farewell.\n“Rest well.”\nCrack!\nGeumyang created a rift in the air and disappeared through it. The rift vanished right after.\nShe had returned to her labyrinth, her so-called ‘home.’\nSilence returned to the house.\n‘Maybe I should drink some water before washing up.’\nI headed to the kitchen.\n“?”",

      "content": "Chapter 48 (Continued)\nA note was left on the table, along with a stack of plates.\n[I made a bit too much, so I brought some over. Eat when you’re hungry ^_^]\nLifting the plate, I found some cold pancakes.\nAlthough I had already eaten a late dinner and was quite full…\nI couldn’t just leave the pancakes that Baek-seo had made for me.\nThud!\nI put the cup down on the table, took out some milk, and poured it over the pancakes, then drizzled caramel sauce on top.\nAfter that, I munched on the pancakes while chugging the milk.\n“Delicious.”\nThough cold, they were sweet.\nThere were also unfamiliar fruits in the fridge, likely brought over by Baek-seo when she visited.\nI couldn’t take her kindness for granted, so I immediately took out my smartphone and sent her a text message.\n[Ahn Woo-jin: Baek-seo]\n[Ahn Woo-jin: Thanks, they’re delicious.]\n[Ahn Woo-jin: (Emoticon of a dog giving a solemn thumbs up)]\nWhile admiring Baek-seo’s profile picture in her hanbok, the phone vibrated with an incoming message.\n[Oh Baek-seo: You must have had a hard time practicing.]\n[Oh Baek-seo: Good job, Leader!]\n[Oh Baek-seo: (Emoticon of a cat smiling brightly)]\n[Oh Baek-seo: Enjoy the food, hehe.]\n‘Ah…’\nJust reading her messages was healing.\n[Ahn Woo-jin: (Emoticon of a dog giving a solemn double thumbs up)]\n[Oh Baek-seo: Hehe]\n[Oh Baek-seo: And, Leader]\n[Oh Baek-seo: Want to go to school together tomorrow?]\nShe brought it up at just the right time.\n[Ahn Woo-jin: It’s going to be difficult for a while.]\n[Oh Baek-seo: Why?]\n[Ahn Woo-jin: You know my ability involves space manipulation, right?]\n[Ahn Woo-jin: I’m planning to practice it while commuting for a while.]\n[Oh Baek-seo: Is that so?]\n[Oh Baek-seo: You’re really diligent.]\n[Oh Baek-seo: Alright, hehe.]\n“…?”\nWas it my imagination?\nThere seemed to be a sudden chill in the message “Alright, hehe.” Maybe it was because the conversation ended so abruptly.\nSince I conveyed what I needed to, it shouldn’t matter. Time to wash up…\n‘…Maybe I should mention it too.’\nSince we were already messaging, it seemed best to tell her ‘that thing’ before washing up.\n[Ahn Woo-jin: Baek-seo]\n[Oh Baek-seo: ?]\n[Ahn Woo-jin: There’s someone I think I should introduce you to soon.]\n[Ahn Woo-jin: It’s an important person.]\nI was talking about Geumyang.\n[Oh Baek-seo: An important person?]\n[Oh Baek-seo: Hmm]\n[Oh Baek-seo: Is it someone you really need to introduce to me?]\n“What?”\nWhat was that?\n‘Isn’t the nuance a bit strange…?’\nWhat did she mean?\nWas she asking if it was necessary to introduce her to someone she didn’t know, or if it was someone important to her?\nBaek-seo’s gentle question had a double meaning.\nFor example, when a friend insists on introducing someone you’re not particularly curious about, it can feel burdensome.\n‘Maybe Baek-seo feels the same.’\nWell, Baek-seo wouldn’t be an exception.\nHowever, spending time with Geumyang might eventually cause misunderstandings with Baek-seo. I couldn’t let that happen to a girl I liked.\nStrictly speaking, I wasn’t dating Baek-seo, but it was still an important issue for me.\nSince Geumyang didn’t want to meet Baek-seo yet, I decided to just give her a heads up.\n[Ahn Woo-jin: Probably]\nI was firm in my resolve.\n[Oh Baek-seo: Okay]\n[Oh Baek-seo: I’ll wait then, hehe.]\n‘She’s not asking who it is?’\nI thought she would ask what kind of relationship it was.\nDid she just assume we were friends?\n‘Well, whatever. I guess she’s not interested.’\nI didn’t overthink it.\nIt would require a long explanation to describe my relationship with Geumyang, so it was better if she didn’t ask.\n…\n“Huff…”\nI wish someone would kill me.\nTeleporting to school was incredibly tough.\nI had to create a rift in a secluded place every time, repeat the process over a long distance, and sometimes the coordinates were off, causing me to fall.\nThe process of teleportation itself was hard enough, but with all the additional concerns, it was exhausting.\n‘At least I managed to start from a somewhat convenient point…’\nIf I hadn’t taken the train and gotten off at a suitable location, it would have taken forever to reach Ahsung High School.\nAnyway, I made it to Ahsung High School safely.\n‘I did it…’\nI felt like collapsing with relief.\nBarely maintaining my composure as the Disciplinary Committee Leader, I passed through the school gate and went straight to the committee office, collapsing into a chair.\n“Phew…”\nI took a deep breath.\nI felt like I could finally live again.\nSweat had drenched my back, so I’d have to use the academy’s shower later.\nAfter school, I spent extra time teleporting multiple times to reach the private training ground.\nOnce there, I summoned Geumyang and trained. When I got home, exhaustion hit me hard, and I leaned against the wall, retching.\n“Are you alright? You seem unsteady.”\n“I feel like dying…”\nIt was a long day…\n“You’ll get used to it gradually. Here, take my hand.”\nHolding Geumyang’s hand, I managed to dispel the remaining penalties. Eventually, Geumyang returned to her labyrinth.\nAfter catching my breath, I regained enough energy to move around.\n“Time to wash up…”\nI had already showered at the academy, but I was drenched in sweat again.\nNow the sweat had dried, making me feel sticky.\nIt was a bit early, but I should wash up and go to bed.\n“…”\nI looked towards the shower room.\n— ‘Setting small goals in daily life and using your abilities often will help you master them faster.’\nGeumyang’s words suddenly came to mind.\n“If it’s just the shower room…”\nThe shorter the distance, the easier it was to set coordinates. The shorter the wormhole, the easier it was to set the coordinates.\nAnyway, I was in the living room.\n‘At least when moving to another room, I should use teleportation.’\nFrequent practice would certainly help improve my skills.\nCrack!\nI created a rift right in front of me.\nThe rift turned into a two-dimensional gate with an alien hue. I entered it and teleported.\nBoom!\nI landed on the desk in my room.\n“Just made it…”\nI couldn’t help but grin.\nThis is… fun.\nNext.\nI created a small rift and put my arm through it.\nCoordinate set, inside the wardrobe.\nSwish.\nI rummaged inside the rift and pulled my arm out.\nIn my hand was a pair of underwear.\n“Oh.”\nThat was impressive.\nThis much showed the results of my practice.\n‘Next is the shower room.’\nCrack!\nFeeling confident, I created another rift and jumped in.\nBoom!\n“Ouch!”\nThe rift had formed quite a bit off the ground, causing me to fall on my butt.\nBut then I felt moisture on my skin.\nA foggy mist was visible.\nThe sound of water pouring from the shower echoed.\nI hadn’t turned on the water yet?\nSwish! The rift closed.\nWhen I looked up, I saw a naked woman’s back, washing under the shower.\nHer enchanting and beautiful figure left me momentarily speechless.\n“Huh…?”\nShe looked at me with a wet face.\nIt was Oh Baek-seo.\n“……”\n“……”\nThe sound of water pouring from the shower enveloped the silence.\n______________\nRate us on\nNovel Updates\nto motivate me translate more chapters.",

      "content": "Chapter 49 – Rule 20. The Leader Relies on the Vice Leader (2)\nWhen showering, it’s natural for various thoughts to arise. It was the same for Oh Baek-seo.\nA few minutes earlier, while showering, Baek-seo recalled the golden hair she found at Ahn Woo-jin’s house.\n‘Whose hair is that?’\nThe thought lingered, questioning her.\nAs far as she knew, there was no one in Woo-jin’s circle with golden hair.\nAn intruder? Unlikely.\nAn intruder who could evade all the security drones and robots wouldn’t be careless enough to leave hair in the middle of the living room. And Woo-jin did mention he would introduce someone soon.\nThat person must be the owner of the golden hair. So, Baek-seo felt somewhat relieved.\nThe person wasn’t an intruder nor someone Woo-jin was hiding.\nBut then, who could it be?\nPerhaps it was the ‘master’ Woo-jin had mentioned before.\nBut thinking that way raised another question.\nWoo-jin had already talked about his master. He had no intention of hiding their existence.\nYet, he merely said, ‘I’ll introduce an important person.’\nIf it were his master, he would have mentioned it explicitly. Therefore, the person with the golden hair was likely a third party Baek-seo didn’t know.\nA golden-haired woman who frequents Woo-jin’s house, whom Baek-seo doesn’t know.\n‘I guess I have to wait.’\nSince Woo-jin said he would introduce the person, she had to trust and wait.\n‘Also…’\nBaek-seo thought of a significant problem.\nThe large-scale incident during the practical evaluation.\nHan Seo-jin’s massacre attempt.The barrier she couldn’t break through that day still lingered in Baek-seo’s mind, chaining her heart like iron.\nIf Woo-jin hadn’t awakened his unique ability, the situation would have been catastrophic.\nUnthinkable things might have happened.\n‘If another person like Han Seo-jin targets Woo-jin, it will be truly dangerous.’\nRecently, Baek-seo often had sleepless nights thinking about it.\n‘Moreover, the reason Han Seo-jin joined the Disciplinary Committee was because of me.’\nShe learned this from Woo-jin.\nAlthough she hadn’t figured out why Seo-jin was monitoring her.\nBut.\n‘That means…’\nOne person came to Baek-seo’s mind.\nSomeone who could have provided Seo-jin with the information about the magic catalyst underground at the practical evaluation site.\nSomeone who had a reason to monitor Baek-seo.\nThe Head Principal, Lee Doo-hee.\n“…”\nThe water from the shower wetted Baek-seo’s hair and flowed down her skin.\nShe squinted and looked up.\nShe thought.\nThe Head Principal would target Woo-jin.\nIt was only a matter of time.\nA free-spirited individual with potential comparable to Goliath, whom the Head Principal desperately wanted in his hands, had appeared.\nIf the Head Principal decided to target Woo-jin… a situation worse than the recent practical evaluation incident might occur.\n‘That won’t happen.’\nBaek-seo resolved herself.\nIn her first year, she had already vowed to protect Woo-jin.\nShe would somehow prevent anyone from laying a hand on Woo-jin.\nThen.\nBoom!\n“!”\nThe sudden impact made Baek-seo instinctively turn away from the source of the sound, covering her chest and left shoulder.\n“Huh…?”\nBaek-seo turned her head slightly and saw a man who had fallen in the shower room.\nFor some reason, Woo-jin was there.\nIn an instant, Baek-seo gasped.\n“…”\n“…”\nWoo-jin had failed to set the coordinates and ended up teleporting into the neighboring shower room.\nFor a while, Woo-jin and Baek-seo just stared at each other. Silence filled the space, but their minds were buzzing with various thoughts.\nAs they say, even in a tiger’s den, one can survive by keeping their wits about them. Woo-jin narrowed his wide eyes, trying to gather his startled expression.\n“Baek-seo.”\nWoo-jin spoke first.\n“This is a misunderstanding.”\nHe spoke earnestly, like a criminal caught in the act, choosing sincere explanation over immediate escape.\n“…Yeah.”\nBaek-seo’s soft voice echoed in the shower room.\n“I know.”\nBaek-seo quickly deduced the situation.\nWoo-jin was strict with himself and valued his dignity.\nHe wasn’t the type of voyeuristic pervert who would secretly watch a naked woman.\nMoreover, he had told Baek-seo that he still couldn’t properly use his ‘space leap’ ability.\nIn other words, he must have made a mistake while practicing his space ability at home and ended up here.\nUnderstanding this sequence of events, Baek-seo tried to smile gently.\n“This is awkward, Leader.”\nIf she let it go like this, Woo-jin would be extremely troubled.\nBaek-seo didn’t want that.\nActing as if it was no big deal.\nAs if there was no problem at all.\nSo Woo-jin wouldn’t feel guilty.\nBaek-seo decided to lighten the mood with a joke, as usual.\n“Were you that eager to see my body?”\nBaek-seo tilted her head slightly and gave a sly smile. However, unlike usual, Woo-jin couldn’t take Baek-seo’s joke lightly.\n‘What should I… say?’\nWoo-jin swallowed nervously, unable to answer immediately. In this situation, a positive response would be tactless and could make him seem like a pervert. On the other hand, a negative response might imply he had no interest in Baek-seo’s body, which could be offensive. He had no intention of conveying such a meaning, even as a joke.\n“That’s…”\nIn the end, Woo-jin covered his mouth and turned his head to the side, his face already turning as red as a ripe apple.\n“Leader, your answer…?”\n“Sorry…”\nAvoiding the question. It was the best, yet the worst choice.\nBaek-seo’s playful joke backfired.\n“Ah…”\nBaek-seo unintentionally let out a small sigh, understanding why Woo-jin avoided the question.\nThe sound of the shower water couldn’t dispel the awkward atmosphere between them. The usual smile that graced Baek-seo’s face didn’t function properly. A mix of shame and an odd sense of liberation from showing her naked body overwhelmed her. It was hard to take her eyes off Woo-jin. His deeply embarrassed expression was endearing to her, especially because she believed it was due to her body.\nThis strange, thrilling emotion running down her spine was hard to control. Even someone as adept at hiding their feelings as Baek-seo found this situation extremely stimulating.\n‘This is dangerous…’\nBaek-seo struggled to turn her head away, deciding not to show her expression to Woo-jin.\nWoo-jin was having a similar difficulty controlling his expression. From the moment he saw Baek-seo’s naked body with its beautiful, arching curves, his rational mind stopped functioning properly.\n“Leader…”",

Her eyes widened, her heart raced, and her lips curled into a smile.\nBaek-seo lowered her head slightly.\n“This is a problem…”\nShe felt a sense of urgency.\nShe already found it difficult to deal with unintended sexual arousal caused by Woo-jin. Ever since she saw Woo-jin naked, this feeling had intensified. The side effect of unfulfilled sexual curiosity lingered strongly.\nIt was surprising how shy she realized she was.\nAnd now, after facing such a situation again, she couldn’t help but imagine impulsively jumping on Woo-jin.\n“Not yet…”\nAt least for now, that was out of the question.\nBaek-seo wanted to help Woo-jin achieve his priorities, marry him, and build a future together.\nFor now, it was best to be content with this excitement.\nAfter closing her eyes and calming her emotions with deep breaths, Baek-seo removed her hand from her left shoulder.\nThe magic engraving on her left shoulder was reflected in the mirror, a skull with fangs.\n* * *\n“Ugh…”\nThis was a disaster.\nAs soon as I got home, I sat on the sofa, covered my face, and groaned.\n‘I messed up.’\nAs the Disciplinary Committee Leader, maintaining my honor?\nMore importantly, I might have traumatized Baek-seo.\n‘Why did I try teleporting at home when my skills are still terrible…’\nI blamed myself.\nHow should I face Baek-seo tomorrow?\nShould I act as if nothing happened?\nCould I even manage my expression?\nI felt overwhelmed already.\nCrack!\nSuddenly, a rift appeared in the air, and a golden-haired girl’s upper body popped out. It was Geumyang.\nGeumyang, half out of the rift, supported her head with her hands and looked at me.\n“Kid, that was quite entertaining.”\n“You watched?”\n“Yes.”\nThis girl…\nGeumyang giggled, climbed out of the rift, and started patting my head. Why?\nI was curious but too exhausted to lift my head.\n“What are you doing?”\n“Comforting you.”\n“Comforting?”\n“According to my extensive knowledge, a male who misses a mating opportunity often falls into despair.”\nI wasn’t sure whether to be grateful or not for Geumyang’s bizarre, biology-based comfort. Or was she just teasing me?\n“It’s not like that… I’ve never thought that way. Baek-seo is someone I need to cherish…”\nGeumyang suddenly leaned forward and looked me in the eyes, startling me into silence.\nHer eyes were sharp like a cat’s, mysterious and clear golden eyes staring into mine.\n“That statement could be seen as pretentious.”\nGeumyang confidently pointed at me.\nI furrowed my brows.\n“What are you talking about…?”\n“Kid, as I’ve said before, I’ve been watching you. I know you like two females.”\nGeumyang placed her hands on my knees to steady herself and spoke from a very close distance.\n“Do you think I wouldn’t know your feelings?”\n“…”\n“It’s better to be honest with your feelings.”\nShe straightened her back and sighed.\nHonestly, do I have no privacy in front of Geumyang?\n“…I’d be arrested for that.”\n“Ha. You’re already confessing?”\nGeumyang laughed arrogantly and teasingly.\n“Well, whatever.”\nI looked up at the ceiling and spoke with a sigh.\n“Baek-seo seemed to understand what happened. After she finishes showering, I’ll sincerely apologize and hope the situation gradually improves.”\nFor now, there seemed to be no better solution.\nI just hoped that in the future, we could laugh it off as something that happened.\n“…At this moment, I didn’t know that today’s events would lead to such tragedy…”\n“Don’t foreshadow ominously.”\nI firmly shut down Geumyang’s narration and stood up.\nI trudged away.\nI was incredibly tired.\nMentally exhausted from the incident in Baek-seo’s shower room.\nAfter sending a sincere apology message to Baek-seo through Kokonotalk, I received a reply that it was okay.\n‘Thank goodness she said it’s okay.’\nFeeling a bit relieved, I showered and lay down on my bed.\n“…”\nIn the quiet room.\nStaring at the dark ceiling, Baek-seo’s naked body, more specifically her enchanting back, flashed in my mind.\nI could feel my heartbeat.\nRegardless of my will, it felt like my blood was boiling.\nWas it simply because I had seen the naked body of the girl I liked?\nThe problem with a young, vigorous body is this.\nBut if I include my previous life, I’m an adult.\nI could quickly calm down this stirring in my chest.\n‘Let’s just sleep…’\nI closed my eyes and fell asleep.\nThat night, in the club room of my dream.\nBaek-seo, smiling, suddenly knocked me over. There was a shadow in her eyes.\n‘Ba, Baek-seo…?’ I stammered, but Baek-seo climbed on top of me, accusing me, ‘Leader, it’s your fault.’\nWhen I woke up in the morning, I realized.\nIt was a wet dream.\n“This is crazy.”\nI had all sorts of dreams.\nI was going crazy.\nI immediately washed my blanket.\nThankfully, I had plenty of time to hang the laundry.\nI was fortunate to wake up early.\n‘How can I face Baek-seo today…’\nHoping the day would start normally, I went to school.\nI felt something was off after meeting Baek-seo.\n______________\nRate us on\nNovel Updates\nto motivate me translate more chapters.",

      "content": "Chapter 50 – Rule 20. The Leader Relies on the Vice Leader (3)\nAs usual, I arrived at the Disciplinary Committee office and sipped hot coffee.\nHowever, unlike most mornings, today wasn’t leisurely. Practicing teleportation while commuting had drained my stamina significantly.\n‘I’m going to die.’\nIt felt like my lifespan was being cut short.\nLooking back at my past, including my previous life, I realized that nothing ever went well without giving it my all. So, I kept practicing tirelessly, as it was the only way I knew.\n“……”\nAs I stared at my coffee cup, the memory of seeing Baek-seo’s naked body yesterday resurfaced.\n‘Putting aside my disgraceful behavior…’\nWhen I fell into Baek-seo’s shower room, I briefly saw her side.\nThere was some kind of drawing on her left shoulder.\nAlthough Baek-seo quickly covered her left shoulder at the time.\n‘That tattoo…’\nThe location and rough color were enough for me to recognize what it was.\nIt was a symbol unknown to the general public—a skull with fangs.\n‘It wasn’t even a tattoo. It was a magical engraving of a Hound.’\nA Hound of the Federal Council, an agent.\nThe secret tattoo of the elite unit ‘Spartoi,’ which means ‘dragon’s tooth.’\nTo be precise, it wasn’t a tattoo but a type of magical engraving that served as Spartoi’s proof.\nI had seen it in the game.\n‘This isn’t a coincidence.’\nIt was too precise and perfect to be a coincidence.\n‘It explains a lot. Why Baek-seo is so skilled in combat.’\nIf I assumed Baek-seo was once a Hound, it cleared up the questions I had while preparing for the midterm exam with her. Questions like, ‘Why is Baek-seo so proficient in combat techniques?’\nSpartoi are essential to Neo Seoul. They perform black ops in the underworld to protect the city.\nTheir training is known to be intensely rigorous.\nIt made sense that they focused on teaching combat techniques.\n‘Then, why is Baek-seo here?’\nDid she infiltrate Ahsung High School with a specific purpose as Spartoi?\nOr did she leave Spartoi to lead a normal school life?\n‘Probably the latter.’\nIf Baek-seo had a secret purpose for infiltrating Ahsung High School, she would have kept her distance from people.\nBut Baek-seo built a close relationship with me and even boldly moved in next door.\nThere was no way her goal was me.\nUntil last year, I hadn’t stood out at all.\nI was just an extra A, with no reason for anyone to target me.\n‘Baek-seo likely has a past as a Spartoi and now wants to hide it.’\nOf course, there weren’t enough clues to make a clear judgment.\nBut.\n‘For now… it’s best to pretend I don’t know.’\nI didn’t want to dig into a past that Baek-seo might not want to talk about.\nMoreover, the reason Han Seo-jin monitored Baek-seo, why Baek-seo might disappear later—all of these could be connected to her past as a Spartoi.\nUntil I could fully understand the situation, I wanted to cautiously gather clues and approach it carefully.\n‘And…’\nI leaned back in my chair and looked up at the ceiling.\n‘How should I face Baek-seo today?’\nThe immediate problem was also an issue.\nSeeing Baek-seo would undoubtedly remind me of yesterday’s events.\nBaek-seo would feel the same.\n‘I’m lucky she doesn’t see me as a villain…’\nMy head was a mess.\n‘Maybe I should shower first.’\nFirst period was a participation class, so I had to go to the classroom.\nIt would be best to shower before going.\nAs I stood up to leave at the appropriate time, the office door suddenly opened with a clatter.\n“Ah.”\nBeyond the open door, I met Baek-seo’s eyes.\nI held my breath for a moment but quickly composed my expression.\n“Good morning.”\n“Morning.”\nWe greeted each other as usual, but there was an awkward atmosphere.\n“Are you leaving already?”\nBaek-seo wore her usual gentle smile.\n“First period is a participation class, so I’m going to shower. I sweat a bit while practicing my unique ability on the way here.”\n“I see. Be careful.”\nBaek-seo swiftly averted her gaze from me and walked to the sofa. Her quick steps seemed to be avoiding me.\nIt felt like she was moving as if evacuating from a disaster.\n‘What is this distance…?’\nMy body stiffened, and cold sweat ran down my back.\nThere was an undeniable distance between us.\n…\n‘She’s clearly avoiding me…!’\nFor several days after that, Baek-seo treated me only formally.\nNo matter how hard I tried to change the mood, it was useless.\nWhenever I brought up a slightly personal topic, Baek-seo would respond with a smile but then end the conversation.\nNo matter what I talked about, it always turned into a formal conversation.\n‘Is she still upset?’\nMy mistake was significant.\nIt was a situation that could have traumatized her.\nEven someone as seemingly perfect as Baek-seo wasn’t superhuman. My mistake might have unknowingly hurt her feelings.\nAnd during the shower incident, I couldn’t even properly respond to Baek-seo’s joke.\nI might be the one responsible for creating this awkward atmosphere.\n‘What should I do…?’\nHow could I ease Baek-seo’s heart?\nAs I processed tasks in the club room on a sunset-filled evening, I agonized over it.\nI had already tried giving her snacks she liked, making small compliments I usually didn’t make, and all sorts of things.\nBut Baek-seo still didn’t treat me as comfortably as before. Instead, she avoided eye contact and kept her distance, as if treating me like a superior at work.\n‘Should I use the ‘Ahn Woo-jin use card’… No, that’s not it.’\nShaking my head, I dismissed the idea of the ‘Ahn Woo-jin use license.’\n‘That would just be copying Baek-seo.’\nIf I did that, it would be overly cheesy.\nI missed Baek-seo’s occasional naughty jokes. Please, just joke around…\nAs I struggled with my thoughts.\n“Haaa…”\n“?”\nSuddenly, Baek-seo let out a long, very long sigh.\nShe placed her hand on her chest and closed her eyes… deeply.\nIt was a sigh that perfectly fit the expression ‘sighing deeply.’\n“It’s done.”\n“What is?”\nWhat?\n“I finally did it.”\n“What do you mean…?”\nBaek-seo turned her head towards me and smiled meaningfully. Her face lit up with the glow of the setting sun.\n“Leader, could you come here for a moment?”\n“Uh?”\nAlthough suspicious, I approached Baek-seo.\nI sat down next to her.\n“Come here.”\n“?”\nGently, Baek-seo placed her hand on my head and pulled me towards her.\nMy cheek touched Baek-seo’s soft thigh.\n“There you go, good boy.”\n“…?”\nOut of nowhere, Baek-seo started stroking my hair while I lay on her thigh.\n‘What is… going on?’\nMy mind was in chaos.\nWhen I turned my gaze, I saw Baek-seo looking down at me with a satisfied expression.\nIt was an unexpectedly picturesque view.\n“…What are you doing?”\nI was bewildered. She had been treating me so formally for days, and now suddenly she was acting this way.\n“I’m fulfilling my duties as the Vice Leader.”\nA lap pillow?",

      "content": "Chapter 50 (Continued)\nI glared at Baek-seo.\n“This is something couples would do. As members of the Disciplinary Committee, we should avoid such behavior… Besides, what if someone walks in suddenly?”\n“I don’t mind.”\nOf course.\nShe didn’t care about such things…\nDespite my words, I found it difficult to get up. Baek-seo’s lap pillow, her gentle touch, felt like a black hole pulling me in.\n‘It’s already past dismissal time, and no one is likely to come now…’\nMoreover, Baek-seo, who had been so distant, was finally opening up to me again.\nI couldn’t let this moment go to waste.\nI justified it to myself and accepted the healing Baek-seo was offering.\n“Leader, you haven’t been sleeping much lately, have you?”\n“Hmm?”\n“You have heavy dark circles under your eyes.”\nBaek-seo pointed under her eyes with her free hand.\nI had been trying to appear strong, but the dark shadows under my eyes were a natural phenomenon I couldn’t hide.\nIt was pointless to pretend otherwise in front of the Vice Leader, considering how closely our work was intertwined.\nI could be honest about this part.\n“Well, there hasn’t been much time to rest. Finals are coming up soon.”\nStudying for finals.\nHandling Disciplinary Committee duties.\nCleaning up after the Han Seo-jin incident.\nTraining my unique ability.\nI barely had any stamina left, and I hardly got any sleep.\nBut I had no choice. No matter how tough it was, now was the time to push forward.\nI had to deal with the remaining Six Sinners.\nI had to stand against the Headmaster if he targeted me.\nAnd on that mysterious day when Baek-seo was supposed to disappear, I had to protect her.\n“Yeah, our leader must be having a hard time.”\nBaek-seo whispered sweetly and kept stroking my hair.\nMaybe because she had been so distant recently, this moment felt extremely dramatic.\nIt wasn’t just a naughty joke or a prank…\nIt felt like she was pouring out affection to make up for how she had treated me.\n‘Ah… this is healing.’\nMy heart naturally melted.\nIt was quite a struggle to manage my expression.\n“Still, I’ve finished all the important tasks.”\n“What?”\n“You’ve been working non-stop all week, haven’t you? And you’ve been very busy… So I tried to ease your burden as much as possible. Did I do well?”\nBaek-seo smiled as if asking for praise.\nI had been so caught up with the ‘to-do list’ looming over me that I hadn’t paid much attention to the work being done by the other officers.\nBut considering all the approval documents Baek-seo had submitted to me were perfect…\nHer use of the term ‘as much as possible’ wasn’t an exaggeration.\n“Did ‘done’ mean you finished all the work?”\nBaek-seo shook her head.\n“Then?”\n“Well… why do you think?”\n?\nBaek-seo tilted her head and smiled mischievously as if she didn’t know either.\nShe continued to stroke my hair without stopping.\n“……”\nI’m quick-witted.\nIt didn’t take much to figure it out.\nIt seemed the incident in the shower room had weighed heavily on her.\nShe needed time to sort out her feelings and return to treating me normally. Baek-seo had been making an effort in her own way.\n“Is that so.”\nIndeed, I couldn’t live without this girl anymore.\n“Baek-seo.”\n“Yeah.”\n“You really are a support to me.”\nI conveyed my honest feelings to Baek-seo.\nShe smiled brightly.\n“I’m glad. I feel like I’m finally someone you can rely on.”\nI immediately understood why she said that.\nI had never explained the part about my knowledge of the game to Baek-seo.\nMaybe she felt she still didn’t have my full trust.\n“That’s…”\nI couldn’t tell her about that part.\nI could only hope that the perceptive Baek-seo understood my true feelings.\n“Me too.”\nBaek-seo interrupted me.\n“You’re a support to me, Leader.”\nHer warm and gentle tone filled my ears.\nI felt heat rise to my head.\n‘This is kind of cringey…’\nLet’s stop this conversation here.\nIt felt like my limbs were cramping up from all this heartfelt sincerity.\n‘I’m getting sleepy.’\nMaybe because I was relieved.\nDrowsiness crept over me.\nHaving been unable to sleep properly due to recent stress, the sleepiness was hard to resist.\n‘Maybe I should take a nap.’\nI gently pushed Baek-seo’s hand that was stroking my hair with my fingers.\n“Thanks. That’s enough. I need to get some sleep…”\n“You can sleep just like this.”\nOf course, that was her answer.\nAs satisfying as this situation was, I couldn’t let myself slack off.\n“If I do, I don’t think I’ll be able to get up…”\nClatter!\n“A wild Ha Yesong appeared! …Huh?”\nThe door to the Disciplinary Committee office burst open, and Ha Yesong appeared.\nI had already sprung up from Baek-seo’s lap like a spring and was stretching. I had heard footsteps just before the door opened, allowing me to react quickly.\nMeanwhile, Baek-seo greeted Yesong with a gentle smile.\n“Leader, why are you suddenly stretching?”\n“Ah, Yesong. I was feeling stiff, so I thought I’d stretch a bit.”\n“Ah, that’s a good habit! Stretching occasionally while sitting and working helps with blood circulation! It’s very good! I, Ha Yesong, do it often too!”\nSo what?\n“But why are you here at this hour?”\n“I came to pick up a snack! Here it is. Safe and sound, Double Special Tiramisu Kun!”\nYesong retrieved a box containing two pieces of tiramisu cake from the office fridge and placed it in a paper bag she had brought.\n“Well, I’ll be off then! See you tomorrow, Baek-seo!”\n“Take care.”\nYesong saluted me and left the office like the wind.\n“…I’m wide awake now.”\n“Hehe.”\nBaek-seo giggled, covering her mouth with her fist.\nAfter that day, thanks to Baek-seo’s efforts, I had more free time during work hours.\nIn the Disciplinary Committee office.\nSecretary Park Minhyuk was working on his laptop hidden in the cabinet, Ha Yesong was chatting about food and eating snacks, and the accountant Yoo Dohyun was napping on the sofa with a book over his face.\nAnd.\n“Leader, are you thinking naughty thoughts again?”\n“Do you think I would? I was just thinking about the supervision of the final exams.”\nBaek-seo, as usual, brought me coffee and subtly joked, smiling warmly.\nNormalcy had returned to my life.\n______________\nRate us on\nNovel Updates\nto motivate me translate more chapters.",

      "content": "Chapter 51 – Rule 21. The Leader Provides a Real Education (1)\n“How is it?”\nHwang Geumyang flicked her long golden hair with her hand, crossed her arms, and looked at me confidently.\n“Do I look pretty?”\nHer cheeks flushed with excitement. Her fierce eyes were brimming with high self-esteem.\nShe was showing off her Ahsung High School uniform.\nWe were at a uniform store. Geumyang had just come out of the fitting room wearing a custom-made uniform.\n‘She’s thrilled.’\nI was sitting on a customer chair, watching Geumyang.\nSeeing her happy made me feel proud as the one paying for it.\n“You do look pretty.”\n“Your answer is a bit long.”\n“Pretty.”\n“Hmm, good.”\nAfter spending several weeks with Geumyang, I had noticed something.\n‘Her dissatisfaction resolves quickly.’\nIf you just say what Geumyang wants to hear, she never gets upset.\n‘Should I call this simple?’\nOr should I say she’s easy to deal with…?\nI don’t know if she’s only like this with me. I haven’t introduced Geumyang to anyone else yet.\n‘It’s comfortable dealing with her.’\nHer personality too.\nIn front of Geumyang, I don’t need to wear the mask of the Disciplinary Committee Leader. It’s easier to deal with her than with Baek-seo.\nNot that Baek-seo is uncomfortable. Recently, I’ve felt more at ease dealing with Baek-seo as well. It felt like we were subtly sharing our feelings.\nHowever, Geumyang, who knows every detail of my computer’s “Zoster” folder, was on a different level.\n‘Well, it’s nice to feel like family.’\nThe problem is that, objectively, Geumyang is not actually family, she has a pretty appearance, and there’s no sense of distance between us.\nAs a guy, sometimes I felt a bit shy around Geumyang. Well, time will solve that, I guess.\n“As expected.”\n“What?”\n“My uniform look is charming.”\n“Do people usually say that about themselves?”\n“Don’t they usually?”\n“No, they don’t.”\n“I will.”\nGeumyang looked at me with fierce eyes.\nThere was a glint in her eyes.\n“Do as you please….”\nHaving high self-esteem isn’t a bad thing.\nGeumyang checked herself out in the mirror from various angles. She seemed to be trying to strike poses that might appear in a photo shoot, but they looked awkward.\n‘Forget about that.’\nI rubbed my chin and carefully observed Geumyang’s uniform.\n‘It needs some adjustments.’\nGeumyang was short and petite, yet surprisingly had a larger chest. Because of that, the buttons on her shirt were a bit strained, revealing a glimpse of her white skin.\nThis occasionally happened with Baek-seo too.\nFor some reason, it only occurred when we were alone, but it was likely an unintended consequence.\n‘…I should stop looking.’\nI quickly averted my gaze. It was quite an arousing sight, and I shouldn’t look any further.\nIn the mirror, Geumyang’s eyes turned toward me. She seemed to have noticed my brief glance.\n“Hm?”\nGeumyang suddenly approached me, squatted down with her knees together, and looked up at me intently.\nI was also sitting, so I didn’t understand why she did that.\nMaybe she was used to looking up at me due to our height difference.\n“What?”\n“As a reward for buying me the uniform.”\nWith a proud expression, Geumyang supported her chin with her hands like a flower.\n“Admire my face to your heart’s content.”\nGeumyang’s confident eyes sparkled.\n“What’s the source of that confidence…?”\nSuddenly, Park Minhyuk came to mind.\n‘If Minhyuk had half of this confidence.’\nHe probably wouldn’t have thrown himself into the trash can out of self-loathing.\n“I’m already aware that I have a pretty appearance and that males like pretty female faces. You’re a male too, aren’t you?”\nHer response was nonchalant.\nI couldn’t help but wonder where to start correcting her way of speaking.\n“First of all… just call them ‘men’ and ‘women’ normally.”\n“You’re nitpicking.”\nGeumyang continued to look at me intently.\nAn AI robot employee tidying clothes glanced at us. A couple of customers who had come in earlier also glanced our way and whispered with a smile.\nAs mentioned before, it was best to go along with Geumyang in these situations.\nIf I didn’t, she would keep pushing her face closer until I did. It would certainly become bothersome.\n“Hm.”\nI leaned forward and looked closely at Geumyang.\nFinally.\n“…Alright. I’ve got a good look at you.”\n“A kid would be happy to be with me. Their eyes get to feast every day.”\n“Yeah, thanks to you, I’m living a happy life.”\nWhile pandering to Geumyang.\nShe relaxed her pose and hugged her knees.\n“Kid.”\n“Hm?”\n“I have a favor to ask.”\nThere was determination in Geumyang’s voice.\n“Don’t ask for something weird.”\n“I want to go to school too!”\nGeumyang’s eyes sparkled.\nI knew this would happen.\n…\n…\nNo outsiders are allowed at Ahsung High School.\nTo gain entry to Ahsung High School, one must apply in advance and be granted permission only after undergoing a thorough security team review.\nI intended to persuade Geumyang that she couldn’t enter Ahsung High School, but she ended up disappearing using her space-jumping ability.\nNo matter how high the security wall, it’s useless against spatial abilities.\n‘Where did she go now!?’\nI found myself suddenly in a game of hide-and-seek in the middle of the night.\nI was also wearing my school uniform. After school, I had trained my spatial abilities under Geumyang and then bought her a uniform.\n‘I’m going to end up sweating again….’\n“Huh?”",

      "content": "Chapter 51 (Continued)\nSurprisingly, the hide-and-seek ended quickly.\nOn the rooftop of the Disciplinary Committee building, a girl in a school uniform was sitting on the railing, looking down at the school grounds.\nHer golden hair fluttered in the night breeze.\nIt was Geumyang.\nSnap!\nSpatial Domination, my unique ability.\nFirst-type magic formula, space jump.\nAvoiding the security drones’ sight, I created a crack in the air, entered it, and jumped straight to the Disciplinary Committee building’s rooftop.\nI wanted to land directly behind Geumyang, but I couldn’t precisely set the coordinates yet.\nI fell below the newly formed crack. It was a position quite far above the building’s rooftop.\nHowever, I wasn’t surprised and naturally landed on the rooftop, having anticipated this situation.\n“How could you just leave without saying anything?”\nI approached Geumyang, asking in a restrained tone.\n“You’re here.”\nGeumyang turned her head to look at me. The lights scattered across the school grounds illuminated her face from behind.\n“Is this where you gain knowledge?”\n“Well, yeah.”\nI approached the railing next to Geumyang.\nTrying to control Geumyang was impossible anyway. Persuading her to leave now would be useless.\nSo, I decided to play along with her.\n“It’s wonderful.”\nGeumyang smiled as she looked at the school grounds again.\n“Once, out of curiosity, I visited a school a long time ago. It wasn’t like this back then. Everything was destroyed, broken, and silent.”\nGeumyang seemed to be recalling a school shortly after the apocalypse.\n“A functioning school is so beautiful…. So is this city. Everything is mysterious and beautiful.”\nFrom my perspective, Geumyang was the mysterious one.\nBut the reverse also seemed true.\nAnyway.\n“Do you also want to attend school?”\nI asked, sensing that was what she wanted.\nGeumyang nodded.\n“That’s right. Learning about human culture is fun.”\nUnfortunately, that wish was difficult to fulfill.\nGeumyang didn’t have an officially registered identity in Neo Seoul.\nPassing the GED and directly entering high school was also not an option.\n‘That’s the principle.’\nHowever, there might be a legal way.\n‘Should I look into it soon?’\nIt didn’t seem too difficult.\nWith the connections I had built as the Disciplinary Committee Leader, I might be able to make it happen.\n“Are you having a nice thought?”\nHuh?\n“…Is my expression that obvious?”\nBaek-seo often read my mind like a ghost.\nGeumyang seemed to do the same.\n“As I said before, I’ve been watching you for a long time. I can quickly pick up on such things.”\nGeumyang answered confidently, smiling with a ‘hoo-hoo.’\n“Even if it’s not other humans, I’m an expert when it comes to you, kid.”\nGeumyang answered with her legs swinging in the air, her chin lifted proudly.\n“Well, with that, you must have some affection for me.”\nI joked, and Geumyang’s eyes widened slightly.\n“Oh-ho, affection…?”\nWhat was this? Was she impressed?\nGeumyang then crossed her arms and tilted her head thoughtfully.\n“Maybe. Is this affection?”\n“?”\nI couldn’t understand why she was suddenly pondering seriously.\nEventually, Geumyang turned her head sideways as if she had discovered something.\n“…Hey, kid. Over there.”\nGeumyang pointed with her chin somewhere.\n“What is it?”\nLeaning forward over the railing and turning my head in the direction she indicated, I saw a building.\n“……”\nMy expression turned cold.\nBeyond the building’s windows.\nThree students, two male and one female, were abusing a lone female student.\nThe male student was stepping on the girl, slapping her face, while the other girl was photographing the beaten girl with a smartphone.\nA blind spot in Ahsung High School’s security.\nSecret bullying among students.\nEven the Disciplinary Committee couldn’t control everything. Just as the police couldn’t eradicate crime despite their numbers.\nThere would always be students who secretly bullied others.\nIn most cases, the perpetrators would prevent the victim from reporting to the Disciplinary Committee.\n“I have work to do.”\nI fastened the Disciplinary Committee Leader’s armband to my arm.\n“This is perfect timing.”\n“What is?”\nGeumyang got down from the railing and stood next to me.\n“Kid, I’m giving you an assignment.”\n“An assignment?”\nGeumyang smiled broadly.\n“It’s time for real education.”\n______________\nRate us on\nNovel Updates\nto motivate me translate more chapters.",

The Leader Provides a Real Education (2)\nMin Hana.\nFirst-year student at Ahsung High School.\nKnown for her timid personality, lack of presence, and fearfulness.\nDespite her significant earnings as a virtual streamer, she has never revealed her identity.\nAs the first semester was coming to an end, Hana still hadn’t made any proper friends.\nAlthough Lee Se-Ah’s group occasionally hung out with her, Hana never fully integrated with them because she found it difficult to socialize.\nThe root of her troubles traced back to middle school.\nWhile carrying her lunch tray, she was jostled by a group of girls led by Han So-Jeong. With her small frame and weak strength, Hana was pushed, spilling her kimchi stew all over So-Jeong’s uniform.\nFrom that day, the bullying by So-Jeong’s group began. They started with dirtying her locker and textbooks, gradually escalating their harassment.\nEventually, they began secretly beating her after school. So-Jeong knew all the school’s blind spots, ensuring Hana often bore bruises all over her body.\nOne day, So-Jeong discovered Hana’s success as a virtual streamer after checking her phone.\n─ “What would happen if you reported me? Your identity would be all over the internet, along with those embarrassing photos I took of you. And then, I’d kill you. Got it, Hana?”\nSo-Jeong’s innocent-seeming threats forced Hana to hand over her earnings.\nHana’s days were a living hell.\nEventually, So-Jeong received a disciplinary transfer to another school after being caught bullying another student.\nThough Hana feared So-Jeong might come back for her or expose her identity online, nothing happened.\nHowever, the constant anxiety wore down Hana’s mental state. Unable to maintain even a fake cheerful demeanor, she lost many of her virtual streamer followers.\nDespite all her efforts in studying and training to get into Ahsung High School, Hana couldn’t escape the lingering effects.\nOne day, Hana discovered that So-Jeong had also enrolled at Ahsung High. She had secretly gotten a boyfriend and formed a new clique.\nSo-Jeong had always been an elite, regardless of her personality. This was another reason why Hana couldn’t fight back against her.\nHana was terrified but decided she couldn’t live like this anymore.\nRather than fearing the exposure of her virtual streamer identity, reclaiming her life became more important.\nHana secretly monitored So-Jeong, discovering that she and her clique might be bullying innocent students again, evading the Disciplinary Committee’s watch.\n‘I need to gather evidence.’\nOnly with evidence could she bring So-Jeong down.\nToday, Hana found a student being beaten by So-Jeong’s group in an abandoned classroom.\nDespite the enjoyment they seemed to get from their vile actions, they found ways to avoid school security.\n‘You haven’t changed at all, you piece of trash.’\nSo-Jeong hadn’t changed at all, despite being disciplined and transferred.\nThis realization was somewhat comforting. If So-Jeong was still irredeemable, Hana had no reason to hesitate in standing up to her.\nIn the dark hallway outside the abandoned classroom, Hana secretly set her smartphone to record and placed it on the window ledge.\n‘This is the surest way, considering So-Jeong’s tactics.’\nExpecting the currently beaten student to help wasn’t realistic. Hana decided to take matters into her own hands.\nHana barged into the abandoned classroom.\n“Who’s she?”\nThe male student beating the girl looked startled. He was So-Jeong’s boyfriend.\n“Oh? You… Hana, right? It’s you!”\nSo-Jeong was momentarily surprised, then impressed.\n“You know her?”\n“A middle school classmate. I’ve told you about her, right? The virtual girl.”\n“Virtual? Ah.”\nSeemed like So-Jeong had already mentioned Hana to her boyfriend, who seemed to understand.\n“You go to the same school?”\n“I didn’t know either.”\nAs an instinctive fear surged, cold sweat dripped down Hana’s forehead. Even though she mustered the courage to confront So-Jeong, her legs trembled as she spoke, making her feel pathetic.\nThe days of bullying flashed before her eyes. Hana closed her eyes and took a deep breath.\n“Long time no see, Hana! I didn’t know we’d go to the same school! It’s almost like fate. But have you been following me? You’ve gotten brave!”\n“How can you still be doing this…?”\nHana, who usually struggled to speak casually with classmates, couldn’t help but address So-Jeong formally.\n“It’s fun.”\nSo-Jeong grabbed the hair of the trembling girl she was beating and lifted her head.\nThe girl’s face was unscathed, but her body must have taken the brunt of the abuse, given her pained expression.\nDespite her shaking voice, Hana managed to speak with courage.\n“A student of Ahsung High School behaving like this… Do you have no intelligence? Don’t you realize that this behavior will ruin your future…?”\n“So you’ve grown, Hana. Talking back to me now! I’ve been so busy, I let you off. Now you think I’m easy?”\nSo-Jeong sneered.\n“Of course, I’ve learned. I was too careless. I should’ve had more fun, more meticulously.”\nCriminals know they’ll be caught and punished. They know their actions aren’t socially acceptable. Yet, recidivism rates are high.\nThere are many reasons, but the main issue is the difficulty in breaking away from criminal behavior.\nSo-Jeong took pleasure in school violence. The process of standing superior to classmates, controlling and tormenting them, brought her satisfaction. Even with Ahsung High’s prestigious status and the Disciplinary Committee Leader’s remarkable efforts, So-Jeong couldn’t suppress this urge.\nIt was the realm of beasts acting on instinct alone.\nHana’s resolve hardened.\n“You really are irredeemable trash.”\nHana’s eyes grew cold.\nHaving been bullied by So-Jeong before, Hana knew.\nSo-Jeong must have made countless terrible threats to ensure the beaten girl wouldn’t speak out about their torment.\n“Haha! Time really is a healer, huh? You’re actually saying this to me. Hana~, since we’re tied by fate, we should play together again.”\nSo-Jeong and her boyfriend chuckled, as if they had found a new toy.\n“Come here, Hana. This place is the perfect spot we recently discovered as a school security blind spot. It’s great for fun.”\nWhack!\n“Ah!”\nSuddenly, Hana was kicked from behind and rolled across the floor of the abandoned classroom.\n“Who’s this kid?”\n“Just in time.”\nA male student from So-Jeong’s group had just returned from the restroom.\nThud!\n“Ugh!”\nSo-Jeong’s boyfriend stepped on Hana and slapped her with a magic-infused hand.\nSlap! Hana screamed.\nAs the pain hit her, past memories vividly resurfaced. Despite her determination, her body began to tremble defensively.\n“You annoying brat. Talking back to our So-Jeong like that.”\nSlap!\n“Fight back a little. This is boring.”\nWhack!\n“Don’t hit the face too much. She’s cute. Go for somewhere else.”\n“Is she your type?”\nThe male students chuckled as they kicked Hana’s body as she rolled on the floor.\n“Friend, transform into chair mode.”\n“C-chair mode…!”\nThe girl who had initially been beaten quickly crawled behind So-Jeong and lay on the floor. So-Jeong sat on her back.\n“Let’s have some fun, babe.”\n“Wanna do ‘that’?”\nSo-Jeong had just taken out her smartphone.\n“Look here. Hey, look here.”\nClap! Clap!\nSo-Jeong’s boyfriend lifted Hana’s head, slapped her cheeks with moderate force, and made her look at the smartphone.\nHana bit her lip.\nShe had to endure.\nHer recording smartphone was hidden out of sight. It would certainly serve as solid evidence.\nThe girl who had been beaten might not help due to the threats. She might even deny wanting So-Jeong’s group punished or say she was just playing along.\nHana believed that the surest way to socially ruin So-Jeong’s group was to do it herself. It might be a foolish method, but Hana harbored a deep resentment towards So-Jeong.\nSo, she had to endure.\n“Ugh…”",

      "content": "Chapter 52 (Continued)\nHana’s eyes welled up with tears as she tried hard to hold them back.\n“Hey, she’s crying.”\n“She’s crying already?”\nThe male student laughed as he began unbuttoning Hana’s shirt.\n“We still have more to do….”\nBoom!\n“Huh?”\nSuddenly, there was a loud noise from a cleaning supply cabinet.\nEveryone’s eyes turned to the cabinet.\nA moment of silence filled the abandoned classroom.\nThen.\nBang!\nThe cabinet door burst open, and something shot out, lunging at the male student who was unbuttoning Hana’s shirt.\n“Gah!”\nA gloved fist connected squarely with the male student’s face.\nCrunch!!\nBoom!!\nUnnatural sounds filled the room, followed by near-explosive impacts.\nThe male student’s body rolled violently across the floor, crashing into the wall.\n“Ugh…”\nThe male student bled profusely from his nose, which was clearly broken.\nEveryone present was shocked.\nThe one who threw the punch was a male student wearing the Disciplinary Committee Leader’s armband.\nIt was Ahn Woo-jin, the Disciplinary Committee Leader of Ahsung High School.\nWoo-jin quickly approached the male student who had been hit and kicked his face.\nCrunch!!\nA chilling sound echoed through the classroom.\nThe sole of Woo-jin’s shoe pressed into the male student’s face, causing a crack to form in the wall behind his head.\nImmediately, the male student’s arm went limp. Even though he had enhanced his body with magic, he couldn’t withstand the force and fell unconscious.\n“Pathetic.”\nWoo-jin’s voice was low and calm.\nSo-Jeong and her boyfriend were frozen in fear. They hadn’t expected such an unexpected presence to burst out from the cabinet. Who could have imagined it?\nThey were certain they couldn’t escape.\nTrying to outrun Woo-jin was like a turtle trying to outrun a cheetah on land.\nStill stepping on the male student’s face, Woo-jin’s gaze shifted. From under the brim of his cap, his shadowed eyes glared at So-Jeong like a predator.\nShe flinched, trembling, and instinctively took a step back.\n“Eek!”\nThud!\nShe tripped over the girl she had been sitting on.\n“How… How did you…? Were you hiding in there…? What?”\nSo-Jeong was bewildered, her mind conjuring impossible scenarios.\nWoo-jin, having predicted her actions from the start, had waited with glaring eyes in the narrow cabinet of the abandoned classroom, his face filled with menacing determination like something out of a horror movie.\nWhy Woo-jin had been in the cabinet and why he had stayed silent until now was beyond understanding.\nBut now wasn’t the time for such thoughts.\n“Disciplinary Committee Leader…?”\nSo-Jeong’s boyfriend’s face turned pale. He too was clueless about what was happening.\nWoo-jin offered no explanation.\nHe had simply used his space-jumping ability to reach the cabinet.\nFirst, he jumped inside the building, closed the distance to the abandoned classroom, set the coordinates precisely, and executed the jump.\nNo one in the classroom knew about Woo-jin’s unique ability to jump through space, as no one except Oh Baek-seo had witnessed it during his battle with Han Seo-jin.\nMost students had only seen a massive flash of light, so no one in the abandoned classroom realized Woo-jin’s ability allowed him to traverse space.\n‘Coordinate setting… This is my first successful attempt.’\nThe task given by Geumyang.\nCreating a crack precisely inside the cabinet and then emerging from it unscathed.\nWoo-jin successfully set the coordinates to his desired location for the first time and staged the scene as per Geumyang’s task.\n“Executing on-site arrest. Perpetrators will be severely punished.”\nWoo-jin declared his intent to enforce school rules, reciting the Disciplinary Committee’s formal statement.\nHe then drew a baton from his belt and swung it.\n*Snap!*\nA metal rod extended from the baton. It was a standard three-section staff.\nWoo-jin looked at the girl who had been treated as a chair and nodded toward the exit.\n“Wait outside.”\nThe girl quickly bowed and left the classroom.\nSo-Jeong wasn’t the type to stay still even with the Disciplinary Committee Leader present. She grabbed the dusty teacher’s desk to stand up and shouted in a trembling voice.\n“T-That was…! E-Excessive force…!”\nShe tried to restrain Woo-jin’s actions.\nAt that moment, pleading or apologizing wasn’t an option for So-Jeong. Her pride wouldn’t allow it, even if her opponent was the Disciplinary Committee Leader.\n“Do you think you’ll get away with this…? Guh?”\nSo-Jeong couldn’t continue her words.\nIn a blink, Woo-jin was in front of her. His piercing eyes met hers for a moment.\nAs So-Jeong instinctively swallowed dryly.\nWham!!\n“Ooof!!”\nThe baton struck her torso. The force bent her arm and twisted her body.\nThud!\nHer arm bones shattered, and she flew against the wall, screaming as she clutched her broken arm.\n“You really thought you’d be safe?”\nWoo-jin crouched down next to So-Jeong.\n“Do you think you’ll get away with this?”\n“Wait…!”\nWoo-jin swung the baton three times, striking her neck, shoulder, and legs.\n“Ahhh!”\nDespite having enhanced her body with magic, it was futile.\nWoo-jin wasn’t using even a tenth of his power, but that alone put him on a different level from anyone in the room.\nIntense pain overwhelmed So-Jeong, who screamed at the top of her lungs, her eyes bloodshot from the agony.\n“So-Jeong!! Nooo!!”\nHer boyfriend lost his mind and charged at Woo-jin, desperate to protect her.\nIt was a reckless and suicidal attempt.\n“Get away from So-Jeong…!”\nHe enhanced his legs with magic and leaped, drawing a dagger imbued with 4th-tier lightning magic.\nHe felt he had to go all out.\nBut.\nWhoosh!\nSmack!\nThe dagger was swung, but Woo-jin easily deflected it with the baton, striking the boy’s hand.\n“Gah!”\nThe bones in his hand broke, and the dagger fell.\n“Unwise.”\nWoo-jin calmly muttered, then mercilessly swung the baton at him.\n*Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!*\nIn an instant, several flashes of light struck his neck, shoulders, arms, and torso.\n“Ahhh…!!”\nAs the boy fell in pain, Woo-jin grabbed his head and slammed it into the floor.\nThud!\nThe boy’s voice was cut off instantly.\n“Carrying a weapon is a special assault crime. Swinging it at me means you’ll receive aggravated punishment.”\nWoo-jin’s chilling tone fell over the room. His cold voice made even the skin tingle.\nSo-Jeong, with a face drenched in tears and fear, and Hana, with a bewildered expression, looked at Woo-jin.\n‘That’s right… I saw it on the internet.’\nHana recalled stories she had seen about Ahsung Middle School. One male student was often mentioned.\nAhn Woo-jin’s name was overshadowed only by the city-level figure, Oh Baek-seo.\nEven in middle school, Woo-jin was well-known.\nA symbol of fear at Ahsung Middle School.\nA cold-blooded and eccentric personality with sharp, predatory eyes.\nAs the Disciplinary Committee Leader, he enforced school rules with excessive violence.\nYet, his exceptional skills earned him respect and trust, securing his position within the committee.\nNow, he actively eradicated crime, having defeated the villain organization Anomia early in his tenure as the Disciplinary Committee Leader.\nHe even captured one of the six notorious criminals, establishing almost legendary status.\nConfronting Woo-jin with pride was essentially suicidal for So-Jeong.\nWoo-jin’s sharp eyes turned back to So-Jeong.\n“Please… Please spare me….”\nSo-Jeong pleaded, feeling like an idiot for her earlier rage.\nThis wasn’t the time to accuse Woo-jin of excessive force. That was insanity. She should have been submissive from the start, she realized too late.\nAccusing Woo-jin of excessive force and planning to backstab him afterward was also absurd.\nWoo-jin had been awarded Platinum Mileage twice for his significant achievements.\nIn all that time, his excessive force had never been an issue. Ahsung High supported him.\n“……”\nWoo-jin approached So-Jeong, reaching into her jacket pocket.\n“What… What are you doing…?”\nHe pulled out a dagger.\nWhen he unsheathed it, the blade reflected the moonlight. It was a dagger with an embedded magic circuit.\nDespite being thrown, So-Jeong’s jacket had felt stiff on one side, and seeing the male student draw a dagger, Woo-jin had been certain So-Jeong was also armed.\n“School violence, group bullying, special crimes. Quite a package.”\n“T-That’s…!”\nSo-Jeong instinctively reached for the dagger.\nThud!\nWoo-jin struck her head, and she finally passed out.\nA stillness settled over the room.\nWhen Woo-jin’s gaze turned to Hana, she swallowed nervously.\n“Are you alright?”\n“Yes, yes….”\nWhen Woo-jin approached and offered his hand, Hana took it and stood up.\n“I’ll need your statement later.”\n“Okay….”\nHana nodded cautiously, feeling a mix of fear and respect towards Woo-jin.\n***\n“I finally succeeded in setting the coordinates correctly.”\nAfter leaving the cleanup to the Disciplinary Committee lieutenant, who was on duty, Woo-jin took Geumyang to a late-night udon restaurant.\n“I expected it to take at least two months. You achieved it faster than I thought.”\nGeumyang leaned her chin on her hand, asking.\n“Do you have a feel for it now?”\nSnap.\nWoo-jin created a small crack above his finger, grasped it, and released it.\nHaving successfully set the coordinates for the first time, he felt a sense of accomplishment.\n“…It feels good.”\nHe nodded.\nThanks to this success, he felt he was finally getting the hang of setting coordinates, just as Geumyang had suggested.",

      "content": "Chapter 53 – Rule 22. The Leader Stays Composed (1)\n“Leader, have you heard the rumors?”\nIt was nearing the end of my first semester as the Disciplinary Committee Leader when Ha Yesong’s words caught my attention.\n“What rumors?”\nThe position of Disciplinary Committee Leader naturally comes with its fair share of gossip. To maintain my authority, it was necessary to stay informed about such rumors.\nWhen I asked Yesong, she opened a cabinet door with a flourish.\n“Eeek!! My eyes!!”\nPark Minhyuk, who was holed up in the dark cabinet, reacted violently as if he were a vampire exposed to sunlight.\nWhether it was the light or seeing Yesong’s face that caused his reaction was unclear.\n“A maniacal Disciplinary Committee Leader who hides in cabinets like Park Minhyuk and catches culprits!”\nYesong closed the cabinet and approached me.\n“Everywhere and nowhere at once, the Schrödinger’s Disciplinary Committee Leader!”\n“Some rumors, huh.”\nStarting from the time I had caught the school bullies in the abandoned classroom by jumping out of a cabinet, rumors had started spreading. As I practiced my spatial leap ability and caught offenders in various unexpected places, strange rumors began to circulate.\n“You’ve been popping out from all sorts of places to catch kids, right? The ones you’ve caught are all terrified! You’ve been using your unique ability, haven’t you?”\n“Well, yes.”\nI nodded.\nThe officers are my closest colleagues. So, I didn’t hide my unique ability from them.\nYesong leaned towards me with a sly smile, covering her mouth with her hand.\n“Leader, do you ever use that ability to sneak into girls’ showers or changing rooms…?”\n“What do you take me for?”\nOf course, there was that one time with Baek-seo’s shower, but…\n‘That was out of my control.’\nIt happened because I was still unskilled with my spatial ability.\n“Stop!!!”\nSuddenly, the cabinet door swung open, and Minhyuk poked his head out, shouting.\n“What kind of slander is that towards our leader! The leader is righteous and flawless! He’s not someone who would indulge in such vulgar fantasies!”\nYesong laughed derisively.\n“Minhyuk, you’re so naive.”\n“What?”\nYesong looked back at Minhyuk and extended her hand towards me.\n“It’s precisely the stern and seemingly flawless leaders who, when they fall into disgraceful acts, create the most dramatic thrill.”\nWhat nonsense.\nBoth Minhyuk and I scowled.\n“The iron-fisted leader who is always dependable, calm, exemplary, and adheres strictly to the rules, accomplishing great feats. Imagine such a leader, unable to control his desires, finally betraying his beliefs and falling into corruption! Or, a leader like that showing a vulnerable side due to ‘unavoidable circumstances’…!”\nYesong was passionately raving.\n“That’s the real thrill!”\nHer eyes sparkled.\n‘She’s serious.’\nWas it some psychological desire to tarnish something pure?\nIt felt like a glimpse into the twisted aspects of modern society.\n“…Leader, should I exclude her? There’s no hope for her.”\n“Hold on.”\nMinhyuk’s forehead veins were bulging in anger at the mere thought of tarnishing my image.\nOf course, in terms of actual combat ability, Yesong far outclassed Minhyuk.\n“Ha Yesong.”\nI sighed and leaned back in my chair.\n“Don’t project your perverted fantasies onto me. It’s disrespectful to me as a person, not just as the leader.”\n“Leader, there’s always a demand for this kind of stuff, you know? Like muscle-heads binging on instant food to bulk up, or straight-A students going wild. That kind of thing has a catharsis.”\n“What are you talking about….”\n“Don’t you think so, Baek-seo?”\nYesong glanced at Baek-seo, who was reading documents on the sofa.\nTrying to get some agreement, huh?\nBut she picked the wrong person.\n‘Our Vice Leader would never agree with that nonsense.’\nBaek-seo was as upright as they come at Ahsung High School.\nShe was a paragon of perfection, incomparable to someone like me.\nBaek-seo agreeing with such twisted imaginings? No way.\n“……”\n“Baek-seo?”\nBaek-seo seemed momentarily lost in thought, as if she had realized something and was deep in contemplation.\nEven Yesong was taken aback.\n“Um.”\nBaek-seo regained her usual smile. However, her lips twitched intermittently.\nWhat could she have been imagining to make her fail at maintaining her expression?\n“I don’t think such imaginings are appropriate.”\nYesong narrowed her eyes.\n“…Baek-seo, you were tempted for a moment, weren’t you?”\n“No, I was not.”\nWhat’s with the tone?\n‘Surely she wasn’t actually tempted…?’\nBaek-seo?\n“See? That’s how it works, Leader. Even if you and Minhyuk-kun don’t get it, when someone seems too perfect, people get curious about when that perfection will break.”\n“Huh….”\nI hadn’t considered that.\nI always tried to show a perfect image.\nBut does showing only a perfect image make people want to see that perfection crumble…?\nWhat a contradiction.\n“Look at Doha. She’s subtly lifting the book covering her face to gauge your reaction!”\n“Hmph.”",

      "content": "Chapter 53 (Continued)\nYoo Doha, who had been lying on the sofa with a book covering her face, reacted. She wasn’t asleep.\nYesong leaned on the sofa’s backrest, looking down at Doha.\n“Yoo Doha, aren’t you curious? To see the leader’s perfect image break?”\nDoha sat up and put the book down. Her cheeks were slightly flushed.\nShe glanced at me with half-open eyes, then quickly averted her gaze when our eyes met.\n“…I am a little curious.”\nIt was the first time I’d seen Doha so embarrassed.\n‘Even Doha?’\nAll three female officers were staring at me. It was unnerving.\nWhat was so fascinating about the idea of my meticulously maintained image as the leader shattering?\n“……”\nAn unsettling atmosphere pervaded the room.\nIt seemed like everyone was having strange thoughts.\nWhatever they were thinking, it was necessary to change the mood to preserve my image.\n“Ha Yesong, come here.”\n“Yes, sir. …Ow!”\nI lightly tapped Yesong on the head with a textbook.\nYesong, who hadn’t strengthened her body with magic, let out a short cry.\n“Stop making weird comments about me.”\n“Heheh.”\nYeseong brushed off the warning with an innocent laugh.\n“Anyway, the more perfect someone seems, the more you want to see their flaws. It’s not just the Leader. Our dear Baek-seo is the same!”\nYeseong’s target shifted to Baek-seo.\n“Me?”\n“Is there anyone as perfect as Baek-seo at Ahsung High?”\nI agreed with that.\nIn my first year, I didn’t really like Baek-seo, or rather, I was closer to disliking her.\nBut now, I couldn’t think of anyone as perfect and kind as Baek-seo.\n“Hehe, not really.”\n“Come on, being too modest is also a flaw.”\nWhile Baek-seo and Yeseong chattered away, I suddenly imagined Baek-seo losing her composure.\n‘Hmm.’\nBaek-seo, with a flushed face, bewildered and flustered.\n‘L-Leader…! W-What should I do…!?’, desperately clinging to me….\n‘…That’s too cute.’\nI must be crazy.\nIt was shockingly adorable, so much so that I couldn’t understand why I hadn’t imagined it before.\nI could easily picture myself confidently shouting, ‘Just trust me!’, and risking my life to help Baek-seo.\n‘Wait, hold on…’\nI shook my head to clear my mind.\n‘If I keep imagining things like this, I’m no different from Ha Yeseong…!’\nI didn’t want to have strange thoughts about Baek-seo.\nBaek-seo was good just the way she was.\n‘Come to think of it, have I ever seen Baek-seo lose her composure?’\nAt the beginning of the semester, the day Baek-seo burned herself.\nThat day, well, it didn’t really feel like she lost her composure.\nEven on the day I inadvertently showed her my naked body.\n‘I’m curious.’\nWhat would it look like for Baek-seo to lose her composure?\nCould she even lose her composure in the first place?\n……\nThe evening sky was dark.\nI had to cut down on space ability practice to focus on preparing for the final exams. Because of that, I was repeatedly doing space leaps intensely under the idea of ‘short but intense’.\nSoon, I returned to the Ahsung High campus and reached the building with my personal study room.\nI hid in the shadows of a narrow alley next to the building so that the students wouldn’t see me.\n“Huff, huff…. I’m dying….”\nLoosening my tie a bit, I breathed heavily.\nRepeatedly performing space leaps in one go was like sprinting at full speed without taking a breath. I had been doing that for an hour, so it was exhausting.\nSweat poured from my entire body.\nIt felt like heat was escaping from me.\n“You’ve been doing space leaps quite intensely, kid.”\nGeumyang appeared, riding the cracks.\nShe was wearing the Ahsung High uniform I recently bought her.\nI looked at Geumyang, still trying to calm my breathing.\nI could feel the backlash of using my unique ability approaching.\n“You must be really tired….”\nI urgently grabbed Geumyang, hugging her tightly.\n“Hold on, kid?”\nMy legs were weak, and my weight shifted onto Geumyang.\nWith her small frame, Geumyang staggered backward, forced to retreat, while I followed her unsteady steps.\nThud. My arms encircling Geumyang touched the building’s outer wall. Lowering my head, I hugged her, taking deep breaths.\nThere was a faint scent, but I didn’t have the time to notice it.\nI felt a soft touch on my waist. Geumyang was hugging me back.\n“Huff, huff…. Whew….”\nAs I felt the penalty transferring to Geumyang, my breathing gradually stabilized.\n“…Feeling better now?”\nGeumyang’s calm voice echoed in my ears.\n“Yeah…. Thanks.”\nI released Geumyang and looked down at her.\nHer face was calm.\nHer sharp eyes were fixed on me.\n“Don’t overdo it. If you overuse your ability, it’ll be like last time.”\n“I’m short on time.”\nI replied, wiping the sweat from my forehead.\nI had to prepare properly for the final exams too.\nI couldn’t lose to Baek-seo.\n“Anyway, I’m fine now.”\n“I’ll be at your house.”\n“Got it.”\nGood.\nI planned to practice space leaps again diligently after finishing studying in the reading room.\nSince the penalty would surely come, I would just hug Geumyang like I did earlier as soon as I got home.\nSome of my strength returned. I left the dark alley, waving to Geumyang.\n“There should be something to eat in the fridge, so help yourself…. Hm?”\nGeumyang had already disappeared.\n* * *\nWhile preparing side dishes for Ahn Woo-jin at home, Oh Baek-seo suddenly recalled what Ha Yeseong had said earlier that day.\nWoo-jin always tried to maintain a poker face, but his emotions often showed. Other students didn’t seem to notice, but Baek-seo could tell.\nBut if Woo-jin experienced such a rapid emotional change that he couldn’t maintain his poker face….\n─ ‘…I’m sorry.’\nFor instance, the time Woo-jin fell into Baek-seo’s shower.\nThe embarrassed face and apology he gave still lingered vividly in Baek-seo’s heart.\n“What am I thinking….”\nBaek-seo touched her cheek and tried to clear her mind.\n“All done.”\nShe finished cooking.\nImagining Woo-jin enjoying her food made her lips curl into a smile.\nShe packed each side dish—braised fish cakes, stir-fried anchovies, and bulgogi—into separate containers and left the house.\nCurrently, Woo-jin was studying in the reading room. So, she decided to put the side dishes in the fridge and leave him a text message. With that in mind, Baek-seo entered the house next door.\nAt that moment, for some reason, she felt moisture on her skin.\n“Huh?”\n“Huh?”\nIn front of the open shower room door.\nA naked woman with a towel around her neck, Geumyang, came out of the shower and made eye contact with Baek-seo.\n“…….”\nA heavy silence filled Woo-jin’s house.",

      "content": "Chapter 54 – Rule 22. The Leader Stays Composed (2)\n“Is it the next-door neighbor?”\nGeumyang quickly covered her naked body with a towel and greeted calmly.\n“Nice to meet you, my name is Geumyang.”\n“……”\nBaek-seo silently stared into Geumyang’s fierce eyes.\nAhn Woo-jin had never introduced Geumyang to Baek-seo. This was because Geumyang did not want it.\nIn fact, this moment was essentially their first meeting.\n“…Who are you?”\nBaek-seo began to speak calmly, exerting superhuman mental strength to keep her usual friendly smile on her face.\nHowever, Baek-seo’s remaining hand was clenched into a tight fist behind her back. A cold shadow also loomed around her eyes.\nIt was a physical reaction she couldn’t control due to the turmoil in her chest.\n“I already told you my name, so I guess you’re asking about something else… Well, I’m someone who’s had no choice but to take shelter in this house.”\nGeumyang went into Woo-jin’s room and came out wearing a loose white shirt.\nBaek-seo immediately recognized that the shirt belonged to Woo-jin.\nGeumyang’s appearance once again shook Baek-seo’s rationality to its core.\n“It’s modest, but come in.”\nBaek-seo didn’t know why Geumyang, not the homeowner, was saying this, but she took off her shoes and went inside without a word.\nBaek-seo had been waiting for Woo-jin to introduce her to the alchemist girl, Geumyang, who was now standing in front of her.\nDespite the delay in their introduction, Baek-seo had understood and waited because Woo-jin had promised to introduce them.\nGiven that he had said he would introduce her, it didn’t seem like their relationship was secretive.\nHowever… Baek-seo had not expected that Woo-jin and Geumyang were so comfortably close.\nThe fact that they were even living together was a shock.\nNot wanting to reveal her emotions, Baek-seo quickly walked to the kitchen and started putting side dishes in the fridge.\nMeanwhile, Geumyang sprawled out naturally on the living room sofa, as if it were her own home.\n“Are you the Leader’s friend?”\n“Not a friend.”\nThe reply was indifferent.\n“You’re not his girlfriend either, right?”\nBaek-seo stated with certainty.\n“Of course not.”\n“……”\n“……”\nBaek-seo hoped Geumyang would explain her relationship with Woo-jin, but no further answer came.\nSilence ensued. Even in the uncomfortable quiet, Geumyang refrained from speaking, looking clearly annoyed.\nIn the end, Baek-seo had to continue asking questions.\n“Are you like adopted siblings? I heard that’s common.”\nAdopted brothers, adopted sisters.\nIn Neo Seoul, many people were without families, so such relationships were common.\nThe problem was with ‘adopted siblings.’ Especially when similar-aged men and women became adopted siblings, it often led to them becoming a couple.\nMoreover, in Neo Seoul, novels, comics, and dramas that featured adopted siblings as a main theme were quite popular.\nMany students even romanticized such relationships.\nWoo-jin wouldn’t be an exception.\n“Hmm. It’s similar, but no.”\nWhether she should feel relieved or not….\nBaek-seo let out a small sigh.\n“Then what is it?”\n“Hmmm.”\nGeumyang stroked her chin in thought, then answered as if she had just remembered.\n“A master-servant relationship?”\nBaek-seo’s movements stopped abruptly.\n* * *\nBzzzz.\nA smartphone vibrated.\n“Hmm?”\nThe caller was ‘Yoon Tae-ho.’\nHe was a friend and the student council treasurer, also a middle school classmate. He was the one who had previously informed her about the exchange meeting with the Mayeon High School Disciplinary Committee.\nHe stepped into the hallway and answered the call.\n“Why are you calling?”\n─ Do you have time?\n“No. I have to prepare for exams, idiot. What’s up?”\n─ I saw the list of transfer students for the second semester and found something strange.\n“Why are you looking at the transfer student list?”\n─ Because the person in charge is next to me. Does that matter?\nTo transfer to Ahsung High, one had to pass a high-level transfer exam.\nThus, every semester, about a dozen transfer students came and went.\nUnless it was a notorious troublemaker with a history of breaking school rules, the disciplinary committee had no reason to care.\nSo, the ‘strange student’ Tae-ho mentioned, could it be a troublemaker?\n“Don’t just throw work at me. I’m busy.”\n─ You really hate it….\nTae-ho clicked his tongue.\n“Tell me, what’s the problem?”\n─ Transfers are usually to go to a better academy, right? To upgrade their academy.\n“Of course.”\n“And?”\n─ But does it make sense for someone from Hanyang to come to Ahsung?\n“……”\nThere was only one place referred to as ‘Hanyang.’\nHanyang Federal Academy.\nUndoubtedly the top academy in Neo Seoul.\nTransferring from there to Ahsung would be a downgrade.\nIt wasn’t incomprehensible, though.\n“Why not? They might prefer to be a big fish in a small pond.”\n─ It didn’t feel like that. And the fact that they applied for the ‘Disciplinary Committee’ also bothered me.\n“……”\n─ Maybe I’m just being overly sensitive.\nTae-ho said.\n─ Recently, you’ve been making quite a name for yourself. Surely, you’ve made some enemies along the way, and now a transfer student from Hanyang Academy wants to join Ahsung High’s Disciplinary Committee… Doesn’t that sound suspicious?\n“It sounds like you’re overanalyzing…”\nIn matters like this, Tae-ho tends to be quite sensitive.",

She was with me when we received the Platinum Mileage.”\nIndeed.\nJust as Tae-ho had said.\nIf she had received the Platinum Mileage, she wasn’t someone who could be considered the tail of the dragon. She would have been one of the outstanding students at Hanyang Federal Academy.\nThis was suspicious.\n─ So, she’s not an acquaintance.\n“No, I’ve never met her in person. Any other suspicious points?”\n─ Doesn’t seem like it. Anyway, just keep this in mind. We can’t have another case like Han Seo-jin.\n“…Understood.”\nHe hung up the phone.\nKim Yeon-hee.\nHe accessed the internet on his smartphone and searched the name.\nIf she received the Platinum Mileage like himself, there would be news articles about her achievements.\n“…A competition?”\nKim Yeon-hee had won first place in a large competition hosted by the Head Principal and the Federal Board, earning the Platinum Mileage as a prize.\n‘The Head Principal….’\nAfter learning that the Head Principal was the mastermind, anything related to her seemed suspicious.\nBut speculating without evidence wouldn’t be meaningful.\nIt could also be that Tae-ho, having gone through the Han Seo-jin incident, was being overly sensitive. He might be too.\nFor now, he decided to withhold judgment.\n“Huh?”\nAt that moment, his smartphone vibrated again.\nThe caller was ‘Vice Leader Oh Baek-seo.’\n“Ahem.”\nAfter clearing her throat, he calmly answered the call.\n“Hey, Baek-seo?”\n─ It’s me.\n“?”\nWhy… did it sound like Geumyang’s voice?\n─ I got caught coming out of the shower by your next-door friend.\nSuddenly, a cold sweat broke out.\n“…Wait. I’ll be right there.”\nHe returned to his seat, gathered his things, and bolted.\nRunning to an inconspicuous spot, he then—\nCrack!\nHe created a fissure and used space leap.\n‘This is bad.’\nGeumyang had asked not to be introduced yet, so he had waited, and with each busy day, he had postponed introducing her to Baek-seo.\n‘Is this how it comes back to bite me?’\nCaught coming out of the shower?\nWho knows what kind of misunderstanding this would cause for Baek-seo, and what Geumyang might have said.\nUsing space leap several times, he arrived in front of his house.\nAfter catching his breath and composing his expression, he opened the front door and went inside.\n“Have you arrived?”\n“Welcome.”\nHuh?\n‘What’s this?’\nWhy were they sitting across from each other at the living room table…?\nAnd why were there refreshments and steaming tea on the table?\nBaek-seo stood up and approached him.\n“I didn’t expect you to come so soon. Give me your bag and clothes. I’ll put them in your room.”\n“It’s fine, I can do it….”\nHe declined, finding it burdensome for Baek-seo to act as if she were her wife.\n“More importantly, why did you use my phone to call me?”\n“She asked to borrow the phone, so I lent it to her.”\nBaek-seo answered, glancing at Geumyang.\nGeumyang was calmly munching on snacks and watching.\n“How much did you two talk?”\nHe asked Geumyang.\n“I told her most of it.”\nMost of it?\n‘Baek-seo understood and accepted all of that already?’\nThere must have been a lot to discuss, and some topics wouldn’t have been easy to accept.\n“Leader.”\nAt that moment, Baek-seo called out to him.\n“That person you said you’d introduce me to before, it’s her, right?”\n“Yes, sorry for the delay.”\n“I see….”\nBaek-seo smiled kindly and tilted her head slightly.\nHe realized the significance of Baek-seo’s smile when he heard her next words.\n“Do you hug and sleep with Geumyang every day?”\n“…Huh?”\nWhat the…?\nWhat exactly did Geumyang explain to make Baek-seo say that?",

The Leader Stays Composed (3)\n“Do you hug and sleep with Geumyang every day?”\n“Of course not,” I replied.\nFor a moment, I felt dizzy and lightheaded, but I barely managed to keep my composure and set the record straight.\nI had to figure out what was being said first.\nAnd then…\n“My name is Geumyang. My job is a god. My hobbies are reading, watching anime, and movies.”\n“Did you introduce yourself like that?”\n“Yes.”\nI see.\nAfter calming down and listening to the story from both Oh Baek-seo and Geumyang, I realized why Baek-seo quickly understood and dismissed Geumyang’s words.\n‘Did she think it was just delusions of grandeur…?’\nWho would believe that one was a god-like being derived from the Golden Sheep?\nNo matter what evidence was shown, it would still seem like the ravings of a pathological liar.\n“To reiterate, you look human, don’t you?”\n“I’m not human.”\nGeumyang sternly corrected Baek-seo.\n“I’m a god!”\nGeumyang declared triumphantly.\n‘Even if you say that….’\nGeumyang had an adorably cute appearance.\nSeeing her sitting on the sofa, wearing my shirt, arms crossed, looking so self-important… it was hard to find any trace of divine majesty.\nFrom the start, the concept of ‘majesty’ was far from Geumyang.\n“Instead, say you’re unemployed.”\n“Once again, don’t use such an unworthy term in my presence.”\nNeedlessly prideful.\n“Then… hmm….”\nWas Baek-seo looking at Geumyang with pity?\n“In summary, the Leader has been ‘taking care’ of this girl?”\n“Taking care of me? That child, of me? Ha, absurd!”\nGeumyang scoffed and got angry.\n“Sorry, I’ll correct myself. This girl has a strange ability that can erase the Leader’s unique power cost, and the Leader has been ‘taking care’ of her, right?”\n“The phrase ‘taking care of her’ hasn’t disappeared at all…?”\nDid Baek-seo misunderstand?\n“Look again, next door. This is my power, Space Domination!”\n“Yes, it is.”\n“Ugh, why won’t you believe it…?”\nGeumyang tried to create a rift as a means of proof.\nEven that, Baek-seo seemed to think, was just one of the special magical formulas that happened while removing my penalty.\n‘This is absurd.’\nI couldn’t help but chuckle.\n“Leader, is that why you were late introducing this girl?”\nHow surprising…\n“…Baek-seo.”\n“Yes.”\n“Let’s talk about that later.”\nBaek-seo, who had been smiling kindly, showed doubt in her eyes.\n***\nIt was summer, yet the night wind was still cool.\nAfter roughly finishing the conversation with Geumyang, Baek-seo treated Geumyang comfortably, and Geumyang said she had lost interest and quickly returned to her labyrinth.\n‘It ended without any major issues.’\nThankfully, there were no big troubles.\nBaek-seo and I stopped by a café to take out a drink and sat on a bench under a streetlight.\nA light conversation should be okay.\n“Leader, is this a date?”\n“…!”\nAn unexpected attack.\nI flinched at Baek-seo’s playful question.\n‘She makes my heart flutter at the most unexpected moments….’\nEspecially after the incident in Baek-seo’s shower room last time, it was even more so.\nI didn’t dislike it, but it was still troubling.\n“We just came out to talk. Don’t say things like that even here….”\n“Just kidding.”\nUsually, when Baek-seo suddenly made such jokes, it was to change the atmosphere.\nI understood and let it pass.\n“Anyway, what I said earlier was a misunderstanding.”\nI got straight to the point.\n“What was?”\n“I’m not taking care of Geumyang. I’m the one being helped.”\nIf there was a misunderstanding, I wanted to correct it immediately.\nSince I would be with Baek-seo for a long time, I didn’t want any weird misunderstandings lingering.\n“…Huh?”\nBaek-seo’s smile disappeared.\n“It might be hard to understand, but everything Geumyang said is true… Why are you looking like that?”\nBaek-seo’s expression was gradually hardening.\nWhat could be the problem?\nI couldn’t help but worry.\n“Leader.”\nBaek-seo had an unusually serious expression.\n“Yes?”\n“Are you really in a master-servant relationship with that girl?”\nCrazy.\nWhat is she talking about now?\n“I heard that you’re in a master and servant relationship. Geumyang is the master, and you’re the servant or like a dog….”\n“…?”\n“Is that really true?”\n‘This is crazy.’\nGeumyang!\nIt took over ten minutes to explain to Baek-seo.\nFortunately, it didn’t take as long as I expected. Baek-seo just listened without questioning too deeply about the confusing parts.\nBy the time a third of my lime mojito was left in my hand,\n“Well… that’s the story. It might be hard to accept all at once, but just understand that it’s not a relationship to be misunderstood.”\nAfter finishing the explanation, I looked at Baek-seo.\n“Yes, I understand what you mean.”\nBaek-seo turned towards me, hugging her knees, staring at me intently.\nIt was a comfortable posture, leaning her shoulders against the backrest, and she had taken off her shoes.\n“Thank you for understanding.”\nBaek-seo shook her head.\n“No, I’m still quite confused.”\n“Is it still hard to believe…?”\n“Honestly… it might take some time to accept.”\nIt was a more subdued reaction than I expected.",

It was far from her usual fake smile.\n“You really didn’t want me to misunderstand you, did you?”\nShe looked somewhat relieved.\n“Of course. You’re my closest ally. I don’t want to hide anything from you.”\nA precious close ally and someone I wanted to be with in the future.\nI was willing to share everything with Baek-seo, except for my game knowledge and the contents of the Jipbakguri folder.\n“That’s a sweet thing to say.”\nBaek-seo lowered her gaze and closed her lips for a moment. What was she thinking?\nAfter a moment, as if she had made up her mind, Baek-seo looked into my eyes again.\n“Leader.”\n“Yes?”\n“I still have something I haven’t told you.”\n“What is it?”\n“I’ll tell you someday when I’m ready.”\n“…”\n‘I didn’t expect her to say that.’\nI thought about it while finishing the remaining lime mojito.\n‘It must be about the engraving.’\nWhat came to mind was the magic engraving on Baek-seo’s shoulder.\nThe symbol of the elite unit, Spartaoi, which performed black ops.\nA magical engraving naturally formed through a contract, which remained even after leaving Spartaoi.\nHowever, it would naturally disappear if one expressed their intention to erase the Spartaoi engraving.\nSeeing that the engraving was still on Baek-seo’s shoulder, she must have seen some value in keeping it.\n‘She must think I don’t know what it means.’\nTherefore, Baek-seo had a past she was hiding from me and a purpose she was aiming for.\nSo, the secret she mentioned she would tell me later was surely about her past as a Spartaoi.\n“Take your time. It’s fine with me.”\n“Yes… Thank you.”\nI would have to wait for Baek-seo to feel comfortable enough to tell me.\nAs the atmosphere started to feel a bit awkward, I stood up.\n“Let’s go back. It’s getting cold.”\n“Right. It still doesn’t feel like summer.”\nAfter finishing our light chat, we started heading home.\n“But Leader.”\n“Yes?”\n“Are you going to sleep with that girl, Geumyang, today?”\n“No, I told you, I’m not.”\n***\n“Hey, kid.”\nIt was dawn.\nI was studying at my desk.\nGeumyang, who had been lying on the bed reading a manga, spoke to me. She had returned from her labyrinth after Baek-seo left.\n“We can’t talk now. I have exams soon.”\n“I think I should tell you why I avoided the girl next door. If you’re not interested, then forget it.”\nScreeech.\nI turned my chair to look at Geumyang.\nI had to hear this.\n“You respond so quickly. I like that.”\n“Go ahead. Why did you avoid her?”\nThe reason for the delay in introducing Geumyang was that from the start, Geumyang didn’t seem to like Baek-seo very much.\nOver time, I realized it wasn’t just because she was shy.\nGeumyang closed her manga after putting a bookmark in it and looked at the ceiling.\n“Oh Baek-seo, that girl… she smells too much like human blood. She must have had a lot of blood on her hands.”\nGeumyang’s mysterious golden eyes glanced at me.\n“…Aren’t you surprised? It feels like a sudden twist in a youth comedy turning into a suspense thriller.”\n“I’m surprised your nose is that good.”\nIf she had been a Spartaoi, she would have ‘cleaned up’ many heinous criminals.\nIt was easy to predict that her hands had been stained with a lot of blood.\nIt wasn’t a trivial issue, but it wasn’t shocking enough to cause me any real surprise.\n“Boring guy. Well, whatever… Anyway.”\nGeumyang sat up and looked at me seriously.\n“That girl could be on the verge of breaking.”\n“What?”\nThat sudden statement was enough to startle me.\nGeumyang raised her right index finger and placed her left palm on top of it.\n“She’s like a cheesecake precariously perched on a single chopstick. Right now, she’s holding on because you’re supporting her. If anything happens to you, she’ll undoubtedly resort to rough actions. That’s how desperate she is.”\n“Why do you think so?”\n“There’s something I can see in people who are on the verge of breaking. What’s the point of explaining metaphysical stuff?”\n“…”\nGiven that Geumyang was a mysterious being who could sense Baek-seo’s bloodstained past, her words didn’t seem out of place.\nI suddenly remembered Baek-seo from the game.\nOutwardly kind and friendly, but underneath, she seemed like a dark and brooding person. She also had a resolute and ruthless side.\nOf course, having a different exterior and interior was a common trait among modern people. However, Baek-seo’s facade was particularly severe, and her true nature seemed as dark as an abyss.\nThe memories from then and Geumyang’s words overlapped in my mind.\nIf I weren’t here, in other words, if there weren’t someone to support her.\nWould Baek-seo have broken down?\n“For some reason, she’s a pitiable girl.”\nGeumyang said casually, as if talking about an acquaintance, while lightly shrugging her shoulders.\n“That’s why I didn’t really want to see her. She’s bound to be obsessively attached to you.”\nThinking about the original Baek-seo from the game, I fell into deep thought.\n“…Did I say something unnecessary?”\nGeumyang turned her gaze towards me.\n“…Ah.”\nRealizing I had taken too long to respond, I shook my head.\n“No… It was helpful. Thanks for telling me.”\n“I’m glad. I’ll take my payment in the form of a cheesecake.”\nWas that why she used cheesecake as a metaphor?\n“I’ll buy it in the evening, so eat it.”\n“Yay.”\nGeumyang lay back down on the bed and resumed reading her manga.\nI decided to keep in mind the information she had given me.\nIt seemed crucial to remember.\nAnd about 30 minutes later,\n“Yaaawn…”\nGeumyang let out a long yawn.\n“Kid, I’m going to sleep…”\n“Aren’t you going back today?”\n“These days, I like sleeping on this bed… I’ll leave space for you… Good night…”\nGeumyang naturally covered herself with the blanket, leaving space for me, and fell asleep.\n“…”\nSilence fell.\nAs I returned to studying, Geumyang kicked the blanket away, so I pulled it back up to cover her properly.\nWatching her sleep soundly, her words filled my mind again.\nThis year or next, for some reason, Oh Baek-seo would go missing.\nThe information I had gathered so far and what Geumyang had told me seemed to be related to Baek-seo’s disappearance.\nI had a strong feeling that some unknown events, which I couldn’t know from the protagonist Lee Taesung’s perspective in the game, would soon unfold around me.\nI needed to be prepared for that time.\nMy eyes darkened.\nMemories of when Dalbi left my side surfaced.\nI never wanted to repeat such an experience.\n“….”\nI would protect Baek-seo no matter what.\nAnd I would crush anything that got in the way.",

Baek-seo had her usual kind smile on her face beside me.\nShuffling.\nLike fluttering petals, the test papers danced and fell to the floor.\nThe joyful moment was short-lived.\n“Whoever has the lowest scores, pick them up.”\nRummaging around.\nAt my command, Yesong began collecting the fallen test papers without a word. Minhyuk laughed raucously, pointing at Yesong.\n‘Finally, the first semester is over.’\nSo much happened.\n‘It was tough, really.’\nFinal exams are over.\nThe summer vacation ceremony is tomorrow.\nToday, which falls between the final exams and the summer vacation ceremony, ended early with all classes finishing up quickly.\nBefore I knew it, my first semester as the Disciplinary Committee Leader had ended.\n‘Woo-jin, you did well…!’\nI comforted myself as I looked out the window.\nPuffy clouds drifted leisurely across the blue sky, carried by the wind.\n‘But… it’s quiet.

It’s all based on self-interest.\n“Are we having a staff dinner today?”\n“Yoo Doha, don’t bail out again.”\n“Hmph. I have a sense of duty, Leader. Isn’t it natural to spend the end of the semester together?”\nSense of duty… That would be the farthest emotion from Doha.\n“Surprising? Doha-ssi participating in all executive events? I thought you’d skip again to prove something.”\n“Right. Surprising.”\nAs Yesong looked up at Doha in admiration while picking up the test papers, Minhyuk agreed.\nDoha squinted.\n“What did you think of me until now…?”\n“A cold, antisocial Treasurer.”\n“A reclusive loner.”\nDoha laughed, saying “Ha, ridiculous” at Yesong and Minhyuk’s blunt replies.\n“More importantly!”\nAfter organizing the picked-up test papers,\nYesong slammed a calendar on the table with vigor.\n“This time, let’s properly plan a summer retreat!”\nSummer retreat.\nAn activity for the Disciplinary Committee’s unity, where everyone goes for a 1-night, 2-day trip during the summer vacation.\nDue to the large number of Disciplinary Committee members, the retreats are handled by each squad, while the executives have a free retreat among themselves.\n“Based on our brief discussion last time, the date seems settled. Now that it’s vacation, let’s forget about exam scores and decide where to go!”\n“You’re the only one who wants to forget the scores.”\n“Leader, you’re being harsh. Do you want me to feel depressed?”\nThe total exam score is determined by combining midterms, assignments, and final exams.\nAs a result, Oh Baek-seo and I shared the top spot in the second-year rankings.\nPark Minhyuk and Yoo Doha also achieved decent scores.\nThe one who recorded the lowest score among us, failing to maintain the regret from the midterms, was none other than Ha Yesong.\nShe said she couldn’t study well because she ate too much and failed to manage her blood sugar.\n“Anyway, let’s discuss it.”\nWe shared and scouted the ‘places worth visiting’ we had researched in advance.\n“Right. Leader, didn’t you mention an artificial beach last time?”\n“I didn’t say I wanted to go.”\n“Summer means the sea! It’s a life etiquette to shout ‘It’s the sea!’ once during summer!”\nAn artificial beach is a place designed to resemble the sea from the old days. There are several such places, and they are popular vacation spots in summer.\nI didn’t particularly have a desire to go.\n“Artificial beach is fine, but as I said before, I prefer a camp.”\nAlthough I hadn’t gone on trips after being reborn, I had roamed around various places in games.\nWhile the artificial beach felt disheartening compared to the sea in my previous life, the camp was fine, so if I were to have fun, I’d rather go camping.\n‘The problem would be the bugs.’\nWhen going on a summer camp, one inevitably faces enemies.\nFerocious creatures with blood-sucking tendencies, mosquitoes.\nAnd various mountain bugs that evoke disgust.\nWhile these were not an issue in games, they were not to be ignored in reality.\n‘Insect repellent should suffice.’\nTools to defend the camp from insects, such as proper insect repellents, should make for a pleasant camping experience.\nIt’s not that I had a great desire for camping. If the other executives wanted to go to the beach, I was willing to vote for that as well.\n“I will follow wherever you decide, Leader. Even to the depths of hell…!”\n“Hell is fine…. Don’t do that in the first place. It’s burdensome.”\nMinhyuk, full of resolve.\nHe seemed determined to go wherever I wanted.\n“Hehe, Leader?”\nYesong slyly approached me and whispered.\n“If we go to the beach, we might get to see Baek-seo-ssi in a bikini?”\n“!”",

      "content": "Chapter 17 (Continued)\nI almost shivered reflexively but maintained my composure and managed my expression.\n“Ow.”\nI flicked Yesong’s forehead lightly.\n“If you say weird things like that again, I won’t let it slide.”\n“Hehe, I was just joking.”\n“Besides, why do you still talk about that….”\n“Because it’s fun?”\nYesong rubbed her forehead and continued to smile, whispering again.\n“But Leader, you seem quite resistant? You must have imagined something quite stimulating.\nLike someone who has seen something even more….”\n“You really….”\nShe had an unnecessary sharp intuition.\nThe other executives seemed uninterested in whatever Yesong was saying. It was common for her to spout strange things.\n“I’m fine with anywhere I can spend time quietly.”\nDoha seemed okay with anywhere.\n“I have a suggestion.”\nSuddenly, Baek-seo spoke, drawing our attention.\nWith her kind smile, Baek-seo said,\n“I found a camp without bugs. How about that?”\n“Show me, Baek-seo-ssi.”\nSeeing the screen on Baek-seo’s smartphone, Yesong gasped and exclaimed in shock.\n“Unlimited meat supply…?”\nWas that the reason?\n***\nNeo Seoul is located in the center of the Korean Peninsula.\nThe four seasons rotate smoothly here.\nThe air polluted by the magical beasts outside clears as it passes over this land.\nRadiation too is naturally blocked as if an excessive amount of harmful elements is filtered out.\nThis was thanks to the blessing of the Golden Sheep bestowed on this land and a few other places on Earth.\n‘Why is it so hot….’\nThus, summers here were as scorching as in my previous life.\nOn the day of the retreat.\nThe cries of cicadas longing to breed filled the air, and the heat of August made the roads shimmer with heatwaves.\nIt was a full-fledged summer.\n“Phew.”\nThankfully, there was a portable mini air conditioner.\nPressing the power button.\nA cool breeze quietly flowed out, cooling my face.\n‘Feels amazing every year.’\nAlthough the high-performance battery drained quickly, requiring careful selection of when and how long to use the mini air conditioner,\nthe cool breeze during the hottest moments brought about a sense of happiness.\n“Hmm?”\nSoon, a cool breeze also blew from the side.\nBaek-seo, who was walking with me, had directed her mini air conditioner towards me.\nTurning my head, I saw Baek-seo’s considerate smile.\n“What are you doing?”\n“You looked hot.”\n“I’m fine. You use it.”\nI turned Baek-seo’s mini air conditioner back towards her.\nHer thoughtfulness was godly.\nDue to summer, Baek-seo’s attire had also become lighter. Her fluttering skirt was shorter than usual.\nThe problem was… occasionally, guys would sneak glances at her.\n‘Where are you looking.’\nIf anyone stared at her, captivated by her appearance, I would make them look away by giving them a look.\nWhen climbing stairs, I subtly walked behind Baek-seo, using the bags in my hands to cover her hips and thighs.\nOn the subway, I sat next to Baek-seo. The interior of the subway was bathed in the silver sunlight streaming through the windows.\n“It’s the first retreat since the first year?”\n“How was it back then?”\nI remember where we went for the retreat and\nwhat we did.\nHowever, last year, I was focused on becoming the Disciplinary Committee Leader.\nLike a politician running for office, I was busy trying to impress the seniors.\nThe retreat didn’t leave any memorable impressions.\n“I’ve never been, so I wouldn’t know.”\n?\n“Why did you talk as if you had been?”\n“I was just basing it on the fact that there was a retreat. Actually, this is my first time. I’m looking forward to it.”\n“Well… Let’s have fun then.”\n“Yes.”\nSince it was her first time, I should ensure it’s a great day for Baek-seo.\n***\n[Park Minhyuk: I’m sorry ㅠㅠ… I suddenly caught a cold…! I’ll atone by committing seppuku…!]\n[Yoo Doha: Suddenly, something important came up that I need to prove.]\n[Ha Yesong: My friend is suddenly very sick…]\n[Ha Yesong: (Crying emoji)]\n[Ha Yesong: I’ll come later!!]\n“……”\nWe arrived at the camp location, a log cabin.\nSeeing my smartphone, I frowned.\n‘What are they saying…?’\nThe three executives collectively pulled a no-show, giving excuses as if they were part of a group project.\nIt didn’t upset me.\nIt was clearly suspicious.\nEven if they were strange, they weren’t devoid of common sense.\nSo, the sense of discomfort was even stronger.\n‘Are they planning something?’\nThey must have secretly planned something behind my back.\nToday isn’t my birthday, nor is it any special anniversary for the Disciplinary Committee, so there must be some hidden motive.\nI couldn’t just say ‘Still, come anyway.’ There was no way to prove their excuses were lies.\n“Leader, what’s wrong?”\nAfter setting down the luggage, Baek-seo approached me.\n“They said they couldn’t come.”\nSeeing my smartphone, Baek-seo pondered without a hint of surprise.\n“Hmm….”\n“Today is the reservation day, so we can’t cancel the stay. We already bought camping supplies, and it would be a waste to leave….”\nShe was true to her role as Vice-Leader.\nInstead of being swayed by emotions, she immediately sought a solution.\nWhat’s this?\nIs she trusting them as colleagues?\nWe turned on the air conditioner and sat against the wall.\nBaek-seo was still thinking.\n“Baek-seo.”\nFeeling sorry for her, I decided to speak directly.\n“Those guys clearly….”\n“Then it can’t be helped.”\n“What?”\nBaek-seo, who seemed to have concluded something in her mind, said,\n“Let’s have the retreat just the two of us?”\n“?”\nShe gave me a gentle smile.\n“I don’t mind at all.”",

      "content": "Chapter 57 – Rule 22. The Leader Stays Composed (5)\n“I’m telling you, Leader and Baek-seo are definitely dating!”\nNear the campsite, in a café.\nIt was located along a mountain road, a place that repurposed an old train, decorating its exterior and interior beautifully.\nThere, two Ahsung High School Disciplinary Committee executives sat together.\n“Hooh.”\nTreasurer Yoo Doha sipped his iced Americano, reacting nonchalantly.\n“They might not be officially dating, but they’re definitely in a romantic phase…!”\nHa Yesong spoke earnestly.\n“Don’t you think you’re a little too interested in their love life?”\n“What are you saying, human? You’re interested too, that’s why you’re part of this plan.”\n“I just didn’t want to interfere with them.”\nDoha calmly stared at the CoconutTalk chat window on his smartphone.\nSecretary Park Minhyuk, Yesong, and Doha had all made excuses to skip the camp at the last minute.\nVice-Leader Oh Baek-seo, known as the saint of Ahsung High School, would have likely noticed their true intentions and remained composed, but what about Leader Ahn Woo-jin’s mood?\nIt probably wouldn’t be good, no matter how you look at it.\n“Worried?”\n“Skipping the camp on the day itself isn’t a great stance to take.”\n“Hey, Doha? This is a golden opportunity! It’s an inevitable risk. The two of them will probably be thrilled with this chance.”\nYesong was excited.\nAfter all, it was the romance of her close colleague Leader Ahn Woo-jin and Vice-Leader Oh Baek-seo. Naturally, she couldn’t help but be intensely curious.\n“Hmph… Do as you please.”\nDoha turned away, snickering.\nHe felt resigned.\n“Oh, here he is.”\nWhen the phone on the table vibrated, Yesong answered the call.\nYesong and Doha leaned closer to the phone.\n“Minhyuk-ssi. How’s it going?”\n─ A variable has emerged.\n“?”\n─ The Mayeon High School Disciplinary Committee Leader is here…!\nWhy is he here?\nYesong and Doha both showed identical expressions of confusion.\n***\n“Ahem….”\nI couldn’t help but make an awkward cough.\nSince Baek-seo accepted the suggestion to have the retreat just the two of us with a “It can’t be helped.”\n‘Suddenly, it’s not a retreat but a date….’\nI wasn’t sure about Baek-seo’s thoughts, but to me, it was definitely a date.\n“Baek-seo, I’m going to the bathroom for a bit.”\n“Okay. I’ll look around here.”\nAs soon as I entered the bathroom, I immediately accessed the internet on my smartphone.\nI posted a question on Speedy Knowledge.\nQ. What do a man and a woman usually do when they go on a 1-night, 2-day trip together?\nA. They engage in intercourse.\nI clicked the dislike button on the answer.\nThen, after thinking about it, it seemed like a reasonable answer, so I also clicked the like button.\nA2. Seems like you’re single. They usually visit beautiful places or enjoy various experiences. They generally take a lot of photos, to create memories and to show off on social media.\nPhotos!\n‘That makes sense.’\nCouples usually take all kinds of photos when they travel.\n‘The tutorial on how to take profile pictures for a girlfriend might come in handy.’\nI had randomly watched a YouTube video titled ‘How to Take Profile Pictures for Your Girlfriend’ out of boredom before.\nBack then, I imagined Kim Dalbi would be my girlfriend, not Baek-seo.\n‘That makes me a bit sad.’\nBut no time for such thoughts now.\nFeeling annoyed at being labeled single, I disliked the second answer as well before leaving the bathroom.\n“Baek-seo?”\nComing out of the bathroom, I looked for Baek-seo.\n‘It’s quiet. Did she go out?’\nI stepped out of the log cabin.\nI immediately noticed Secretary Park Minhyuk hiding in a tree but pretended not to see him.\nHe was trying to act like a spy movie protagonist, and it would be rude to disturb him. I was just glad he wasn’t actually sick with a summer cold.\n“Hmm?”\nI found Baek-seo.\nShe was talking to a familiar man and woman.\n“Ah, Leader.”\n“!”\nWhen Baek-seo called me, the two looked startled.\nGlasses guy.\nThe one from the exchange meeting with the Ahsung High School Disciplinary Committee….\n‘Lee Jae-ho?’\nIt was Mayeon High School Disciplinary Committee Leader Lee Jae-ho and Vice-Leader Shin Ga-yeon.\n“Ahn Woo-jin…?”\nJae-ho was surprised.\nGa-yeon quickly composed herself and bowed to me.\n“Mayeon High School Disciplinary Committee, why are you here…?”\nI asked as I approached Baek-seo.\nJae-ho and Ga-yeon were in perfect vacation attire. It was clear they had come here to relax.\n“They said they’re here for a retreat like us, but their other members couldn’t make it due to circumstances.”\nBaek-seo answered on their behalf.\n‘For a retreat, the cabin seems small?’\nThe log cabin behind them.\nIt looked just right for two people.\n“Never expected to run into Ahsung High School in a place like this….”\nJae-ho adjusted his glasses with his usual seriousness.\n“Don’t tell me you’re here to spy on Mayeon High School Disciplinary Committee? Did you use informants for this too?”\n“No way….”\nMaybe because of the arm-wrestling match we had during the exchange meeting, his suspicion seemed heightened.\n“Leader, please stop imagining things. It’s obviously a coincidence.”\nVice-Leader Shin Ga-yeon rebuked with an annoyed expression.\n“Vice-Leader, why would I meet this guy by coincidence? What’s so special about coincidences!?”\n“There’s no way to answer if you blame coincidences….”\nGa-yeon sighed softly.\n“This place has good conditions, great views, unlimited meat, and high ratings as a campsite.”\n“But…!”\n“We booked late, so this was the only time we could get. Ahsung High School might have booked late too, given the amount of incidents they’ve been dealing with. It’s quite possible.”\n“I know that!”\nJae-ho flared up.\n‘Why don’t you just ask us directly?’\nI didn’t understand why he was making deductions in front of us.\nEven if they were correct deductions.\n“Leader.”\nWhile Jae-ho and Ga-yeon were bickering, Baek-seo whispered to me, covering her mouth with her hand.\n“Let’s pretend we don’t know.”\n“Of course.”\nInteresting.\nFrom the game, I knew Lee Jae-ho had a sister complex.\nHe adored and admired his sister.\nBut did that emotion have nothing to do with romantic feelings?\nOr was Shin Ga-yeon attractive enough to surpass even that?\nWell, the result was right in front of me.\n‘We’re in the same boat.’\nMayeon High School also forbids dating on campus.\nHowever, the Disciplinary Committee, which is supposed to enforce the rules, having its Leader and Vice-Leader break the rules….\n‘I’m not in a position to criticize.’\nI felt a sense of kinship rather than contempt.\nOf course, I still strictly followed the rules.\n“That’s it. I’m heading back first!”\nJae-ho stomped off back to the log cabin.\n“Rest well, Ahsung High School.”\n“You too.”\nGa-yeon greeted us politely before following Jae-ho.\n***",

      "content": "Chapter 57 (Continued)\nThere was a small private pool in front of the log cabin.\nIt was shaded under a canopy, blocking the sunlight, and lit by lights.\nIt felt cool.\nIn winter, it was used as an open-air bath.\nWearing a black rash guard, I soaked in the pool, taking in the view of the forest below the mountain.\nIf this were a normal retreat, I’d be enjoying the scenery and relaxing….\n‘This is bad…. I’m getting more nervous.’\nMy heart was beating aggressively.\nThe retreat with Baek-seo felt more like a date, which I was trying to ignore.\n‘Because of Mayeon High School….’\nThe presence of the Mayeon High School Disciplinary Committee brought the date-like feeling to the surface, making it undeniable.\nMy heart felt like it was going to explode.\n‘This is crazy.’\nStill, a vigorous body.\nThe freedom of the trip + being alone with the girl I like. The two combined made me feel extremely excited.\n‘Can I get through today without breaking my image…?’\nI had no confidence.\n“Leader, did you wait long?”\n“Oh, you’re….”\nWhen I turned to the direction of Baek-seo’s voice, my time stopped.\nBaek-seo in a swimsuit that accentuated her figure.\nIt was close to a rash guard, but the short hem of the top exposed her slender waist and smooth abdomen.\nThe bottom was very short, almost like underwear, showing off her legs.\n‘Ugh…!’\nI clutched my chest internally.\nMy heart hurt.\nBaek-seo usually dressed in a modest and fluttery manner.\nPerhaps that’s why her bold attire today was a strong stimulus to my heart.\nEven though she wore long sleeves to cover the magic engraving on her shoulder, it didn’t matter.\n“What’s wrong? Is this outfit weird?”\n“No way….”\nI was just grateful….\n“Come in.”\n“Okay. I’m coming in.”\nSpeaking in a soft tone, Baek-seo smiled like an angel as she entered the small pool.\nShe placed a tube and a tray on the pool, floating them.\nOn the tray were drinks.\nMeanwhile, I pretended to look at the view, avoiding giving Baek-seo a proper glance.\n‘I’m going to die…. Why is she so pretty?’\nIt was overwhelming.\nThe fact that it was just the two of us in a date-like situation made my heart pound even more.\n“What are you looking at?”\nSuddenly, Baek-seo came up beside me. She leaned her arms on the pool edge like I did, looking at the view together.\nIt was hard to maintain my expression.\n“Just enjoying the scenery. Should I take a picture for you?”\nTrying to change the topic naturally, I met Baek-seo’s eyes.\nShe shook her head and smiled.\n“I’d rather just stay like this for now.”\n“…We can take pictures later then.”\nI didn’t expect that.\nDon’t people usually like taking pictures? Not me, but generally.\n“…It’s hard to do something fun with just the two of us. Retreats are meant to be enjoyed with many people. This is too quiet, isn’t it?”\nI said whatever came to mind in the quietness.\nIf the other executives were here,\nit would have been noisy even in this small pool, and the atmosphere would have been quite lively.\n‘It’s a shame Baek-seo’s first retreat turned out like this.’\nI didn’t know the exact intentions of the three executives, but it was a shame I couldn’t make it more enjoyable for Baek-seo.\n“I’m already having plenty of fun.”\nBaek-seo answered with a confused expression.\n“Huh? Isn’t this the same as usual with just the two of us?”\n“No, it’s different. I’m excited.”\nBaek-seo smiled.\n“It’s not a common opportunity, is it?”\n…?\n“It’s rare, yes?”\nI thought it was just a polite response.\nBut seeing Baek-seo’s genuinely happy face, I was surprised.\n“Hmm…. But it’s not just about me having fun, should we play a game?”\n“Sure. What game?”\n“Let’s do a duck walk race underwater to the other side, but with our eyes closed.”\nAn unexpected game.\n“What kind of game is that? It’s unique.”\n“Duck race?”\nWhy did she sound unsure of the game’s name?\n“…Did you just make it up?”\n“Caught me.”\nBaek-seo laughed playfully.\nCute.\n“Well, sounds fun.”\nIt was something active and not too difficult since it was in the water.\nThe pool was small, so it would be a quick round trip.\nEven if we collided, it wouldn’t hurt, and it might create some funny moments.\n“Let’s bet something. Like a light request?”\n“Got it.”\nAfter moving the tray with drinks and the tube out of the pool,\nBaek-seo and I positioned ourselves at one end of the pool.\n“Ready, go.”\nAt Baek-seo’s word, we squatted and submerged, and I started the duck walk with my eyes closed.\nA few seconds later.\nIn the darkness, my hand touched the opposite wall.\n‘Reached the other side.’\nTurning around, I extended my hand and started to return to the original spot.\nSquishy.\n‘Huh?’\nI felt a smooth sensation that shouldn’t have been there and opened my eyes in surprise.\nRising quickly, I saw Baek-seo’s smooth abs right in front of me.\nAs I lifted my gaze, I saw Baek-seo, her hair soaked, looking down at me.\nI realized then that my hand had touched Baek-seo’s thigh.\n“Pervert.”\nHer gentle voice whispered in my ear.\nThough not a serious accusation, Baek-seo was smiling softly.\n“……”\nBefore I could feel embarrassed, I was momentarily dazed.\nThey say extreme surprise can make you calm?\nThat’s how I felt.\n“Sorry…. As a leader, I made a mistake….”\nFinally, an apology slipped out of my mouth.\nBaek-seo shook her head playfully.\n“It’s okay. I know it wasn’t intentional.”\n“Of course, it wasn’t intentional.”\n“Yes, that’s right. Anyway, you lost, Leader.”\n“It seems so.”\nBut did Baek-seo really do the duck walk?\n‘Come to think of it, I didn’t feel anything beside me while walking.’\nDid she plan this from the start….\nNo way.\nThat’s too far-fetched.\nIn any case, I felt like I had lost to Baek-seo in more ways than one.\n“Let’s get the drinks….”\nTrying to act natural, I quickly moved away from Baek-seo and turned my head.\nSwallowing my dry throat, I felt an intense thirst.\n‘Can’t keep my expression neutral….’\nDespite the cool water, my head felt hot.\nI felt like I was losing my composure.\nI needed to drink something to manage my emotions.\nAs I moved towards the drinks,\n“?”\nI suddenly noticed the log cabin where the Mayeon High School Disciplinary Committee was staying.\nJae-ho and Ga-yeon were in the small pool in front of their cabin, holding each other’s shoulders, gazing into each other’s eyes, lost in their own world.\n“Leader? Ah.”\nBaek-seo approached me and saw the same scene.\nWe both froze.\n“……!”\nJae-ho and Ga-yeon noticed our gaze and quickly separated. The sound of splashing water echoed to us.\nWith flushed faces, they both looked down. It was a pure moment of youthful romance.\n‘Please, don’t make me conscious of this….’\nSeeing others in love makes you want to experience it too.\nBecause of them, the atmosphere between Baek-seo and me grew awkward.",

      "content": "Chapter 58 – Rule 22. The Leader Stays Composed (6)\nLast year, on the day of the induction ceremony for new disciplinary committee members.\nThat’s when I first met Baek Seo.\nThere were so many new members that the welcome ceremony was divided into groups.\nNaturally, even among the freshmen, Baek Seo received an extraordinary amount of attention.\nMany seniors praised her, saying, \"You are the future of our disciplinary committee,\" and showered her with all sorts of compliments.\nHer peers admired Baek Seo's abilities, calling her a genius, and were eager to win her favor.\nThe quiet competition among the male students, who felt romantic emotions towards Baek Seo and approached her, was quite interesting.\nWith a gentle smile, Baek Seo kindly accepted each approach. Many male students were delighted just by the fact that she didn’t shy away from them, as burning youth often does.\nHowever, there was one fact that Baek Seo couldn't hide from me.\n\"They're all being avoided.\"\nBaek Seo was displaying her high-level boundary-drawing skills.\nThanks to my past social experiences and the character traits I saw in her from the game, it was easy to understand.\nI wasn't particularly interested.\nI wasn't in a hurry to fill the emptiness in my heart after Kim Dalbi left.\nMoreover, the characters I could call my favorite in the game were only the heroines attending Saeing High School, the female leads of the protagonist, Lee Taeseong.\nIn the game, the impression I had of Baek Seo was just of a \"pretty female character.\"\nOf course, it was important to gather information about Baek Seo, who would become the vice president, but that was a secondary task.\nWhat was more important was to score points with the seniors from the start. I had to become the next president of the disciplinary committee.\nThere was no better opportunity than the induction ceremony for new members.\nSo I lost interest in Baek Seo and was busy trying to win the favor of the senior members by showing a disciplined attitude.\nThe seniors enjoyed my strict demeanor and seriousness, and they nodded with satisfaction every time they heard my ambition to become the president.\nOf course, every senior subtly hinted that Baek Seo would become the next president, showing their concern.\nI didn't care.\nBaek Seo wouldn't become the president.\nThe welcome ceremony continued late into the night.\nWhen I went out for some fresh air.\nOn my way to the convenience store, a female student approached me.\n\"Hey, where are you going?\"\nIt was Baek Seo.\n\"?\"\nWhy is she talking to me outside?\nA girl I hadn’t even greeted before.\nThe character Baek Seo I knew didn’t have a particularly good personality.\nA hypocritical smile, secretly looking down on others.\nThat’s how she was depicted in the game.\nIn a way, it was a personality I didn’t like. An uncharacteristic adult-like sullenness for her age.\nOf course, later on, my opinion changed, and I recognized that there was no one as kind as Baek Seo.\nBut at that time, it was so.\nThat’s why it was strange that Baek Seo, who was unfamiliar to me, talked to me.\n\"I’m going to the convenience store.\"\n\"Me too. Shall we go together?\"\n\"Hmm? I don’t mind.\"\nI really didn’t mind.\nShe wouldn’t have any malicious intent.\nAt the nearby convenience store, I looked for banana milk.\n\"1+1 event. The event period is until today.\"\nOne would satisfy my need, but it felt like a loss to buy just one, so I chose two.\nMy thrifty saving spirit, Ahn Woojin, played a part in that.\nBaek Seo chose chocolate, and we each paid for our own.\nOn the way back to the party venue.\n\"Will you drink both of those?\"\n\"I picked two because of the one-plus-one event. Want one?\"\nI actually only wanted to drink one.\nI didn’t mind giving the other one.\n\"No. It's okay….\"\nBaek Seo glanced at the party venue and then changed her mind.\n\"Actually, could I have one?\"\nI handed her one banana milk and a straw, and she inserted the straw into the milk.\nSluuuurp. She took a sip and started talking.\n\"I overheard earlier. Did you say you’re going to become the president…?\"\nIt was a cautious question.\nThat’s when I realized why Baek Seo had followed me.\n‘Did she follow me to ask about this?’\nShe must have been a little curious after hearing my ambition.\nWhich made sense because everyone in the disciplinary committee had already decided that Baek Seo would be the next president.\nBaek Seo couldn’t have been unaware of that atmosphere.\nEven if I were someone else, I would have thought, ‘Is Ahn Woojin an idiot?’\n‘Well, other students also couldn’t say they wanted to be the president.’\nOther students aiming to become the next president were also not revealing their ambitions because of Baek Seo’s presence.\nEven the one who became the president in the original story was keeping quiet.\nIt’s natural for people to shrink back in the face of a high-level competitor.\nSo, even if I were Baek Seo, I would have been curious.\nHow clueless and foolish must one be to declare, \"I will be the president of the disciplinary committee!\" with a genius like Baek Seo as the competition.\n\"That's right.\"\nI answered nonchalantly.\nAnyway, you’re not going to be the president.\nYou’ll reveal that intention later when the candidates are selected.\nSo, there was no reason for me to worry about Baek Seo.\n\"I will be the president. Sorry if you were planning to be.\"\n\"You're quite confident.\"\nWas she testing me?\nOr mocking me?\n\"I’ll pay you back for the milk later.\"\nBaek Seo said, lightly shaking the banana milk.\n\"No need. It’s not a favor that would create a sense of debt.\"\n\"Is that so?\"\nShe threw the empty banana milk container into a nearby trash can.\nThere was Park Minhyuk crammed into the leaf collection trash can next to it, but I ignored him, thinking he was a madman.\n\"Take care.\"\nI entered the party venue first.\nBaek Seo was receiving the affection of many male students, and many members were gathered at the venue at that time.\nTo become the next president, it was crucial not to earn their disfavor, so I wanted to distance myself from Baek Seo for the time being.\nFor some reason, Baek Seo quietly watched my retreating figure.\nAfter returning to the party venue, I occasionally glanced out the window. For some reason, Baek Seo stayed outside the building instead of entering the venue.\nFor a while, she leaned against the outer wall of the building, drinking banana milk and spending time, probably on her smartphone.\n‘…Seems boring.’\nIt looked like the welcome ceremony was boring to her.\nI must have been part of that ‘boring’ category too.\nThen I understood why she took the banana milk from me. She probably wanted something to drink while spending time outside.\nIgnoring Baek Seo, I focused on the welcome ceremony.\nEventually, Baek Seo returned to the venue, greeted the seniors, and then left.\n\"What's on your mind?\"\nBaek Seo's subtle voice cut off my flashback.\nIt was after spending time at the pool and taking a shower. The banana milk in my hand reminded me of last year.\n\"I just suddenly remembered last year's welcome ceremony.\"\nPoke. I inserted a straw into the banana milk and drank it. It was sweet.\n\"President, you gave me banana milk back then, right?\"\n\"Yes. At that time, Park Minhyuk was also stuck in the trash can.\"\n\"Was he? I don’t remember that.\"\nIt should have been quite noticeable.\nIt was a pretty impressive scene.\n…Well, maybe not.\nThat’s right. It was the welcome ceremony that seemed boring to Baek Seo back then. She probably wasn’t interested in the antics of the students.\nCome to think of it.\n\"…Suddenly, I’m curious.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nI realized I could ask now.\n\"How did I seem to you back then? When I was going around declaring I would be president.\"\nWhile sipping banana milk, Baek Seo paused and then answered after some thought.\n\"Honestly, I don’t think I had a very good impression.\"\nAs expected, it wasn’t a good impression.\n\"But I think I was a bit interested. To see if it was just an empty desire.\"\n\"Really….\"\nSo, at least you were curious.\n\"In hindsight, I think it was fortunate.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"I had a reason to talk to you, the president.\"\n\"…Was it?\"\nBaek Seo smiled softly.\n\"Let's go have dinner.\"\nIt was getting close to sunset.\nPark Minhyuk was walking along the mountain road, following the guardrail.\n─ Report, secretary. Did the president and vice president engage in any affectionate behavior? \"Strategic retreat.\" ─ What? Why!? \"Handling the president and vice president is tough enough. How can I monitor them with the Myunghyeon High School president too?\" Minhyuk replied to Ha Yesong, who was role-playing on the other end of the smartphone.\n─ Were you always this weak? Show your full stealth skills that you developed being stuck in trash cans! \"That sounds a bit offensive… Anyway, I’m not confident. What if I get caught and something bad happens?\"\nAhn Woojin, Oh Baek Seo.\nAnd the president and vice president of Myunghyeon High School.\nIt was practically impossible to monitor them closely and secretly.\nUnless some special method was used.\n─ Well…. Can’t be helped.\nYesong agreed and changed the plan.\n─ We’ll go with Plan B!\nThe people who came to the campsite were preparing dinner at the outdoor tables.\nThe food was provided by the campsite. We just had to bring ourselves to the table.\n‘Though there’s no romanticism of grilling barbecue ourselves. This is good for just the two of us.’\nBarbecue is romanticized, but the process of grilling meat is hot and tiring.\nIn the current situation, it was better to enjoy delicious meat comfortably.\n‘Those guys….’\nThe president and vice president of Myunghyeon High School seemed to be eating meat amicably.\nThe president, Lee Jaehho, and I made eye contact. We narrowed our eyes and stared at each other for a while, then turned our gazes away.\n‘Pretending not to know each other is for the best.’\nNothing happened. It was best for us to pass it off like that today. We silently agreed.\nI had dinner with Baek Seo, taking pictures of each other. Then I turned my head towards the direction where Park Minhyuk was before.\n‘He’s been gone for a while.’\nI didn’t know where he went.\n‘What on earth are they doing…?’\nHa Yesong was eyeing unlimited meat. I didn’t know what her plan was, but I didn’t want to skip a meal….\n\"Hmm?\"\nTowards the direction of another log cabin.\nI briefly saw a familiar face through the window.\nThe face of a female student with cheeks puffed up like a hamster, stuffed with something.\nWhen she noticed my head turning, she made an ‘Oh no’ expression and quickly ducked.\n‘Why are you there…?’\nIt was obviously Ha Yesong.",

      "content": "Chapter 58 – Rule 22. The Leader Stays Composed (7)\nThose guys….’\nI hadn’t been mistaken. I was sure I saw Ha Yesong staring at me with a mouth full of pork belly from the log cabin.\n‘First it was Park Minhyuk. Now it’s Ha Yesong….’\nIt seemed the committee members were watching us from the other log cabin.\nI began to understand why they didn’t join us at the camp.\n‘Is it to leave Baek Seo and me alone?’\nThey had a history of such behavior.\n‘What a pointless effort….’\nJust as I was about to get up and bring them over, Baek Seo’s gentle voice caught my attention.\n“What are you looking at?”\n“Baek Seo, it seems like the others….”\n“Hmm?”\nShe tilted her head, listening intently to what I was saying.\n“Uh….”\nSuddenly, her face glowed with a radiance one might only find in a romance manga.\nThey say that when you see a celebrity in person, they actually seem to shine.\nBeing next to Baek Seo, I could experience that phenomenon firsthand.\nMy bottom reattached to the chair. It was irresistible.\n“Why didn’t they all come? The meat is delicious. It’s a shame.”\n“Right.”\nWell….\nWouldn’t it be okay?\nAfter all, it seemed their unanimous goal was for Baek Seo and me to be alone.\n‘I’ll respect their intentions.’\nIt seemed better to delay questioning until it was impossible to pretend ignorance, or until they revealed themselves.\nThat’s how I persuaded myself.\n“Let’s find another time to meet up again.”\nBaek Seo let out a kind laugh.\nRelieved that Yesong had her fill of unlimited meat, I chatted with Baek Seo.\n……\nThe pros and cons of a retreat: playing with several people in one house.\nIf you’re with close friends, the pros stand out.\nWhile it was fun being alone with Baek Seo, it wasn’t the kind of fun you get from a retreat.\n“I think those two will end up together.”\nBaek Seo shared her thoughts while watching a dating program on TV.\nThe show featured high school students, attractive like celebrities, who had retreats and got into romantic antics. As usual with dating programs, it was quite entertaining.\n“It does look like that.”\n“It’s called mirroring when someone unconsciously mimics the other’s actions.”\n“Mirroring?”\n“A symptom that appears when you have feelings for someone.”\nBaek Seo gave me a look as if I had exhibited mirroring behavior.\n‘What should we do now?’\nWe had done everything there was to do together until it got dark.\nWe had talked so much over food that we had run out of topics.\n‘We’re both not very talkative people….’\nIn the end, even during a retreat, we ended up talking while watching TV.\nPlaying silly pranks was also difficult. Neither of our personalities suited that.\n‘It also affects my image.’\nAfter all, Baek Seo was the kind of person who suited spending leisurely time talking to flowers in a garden.\n‘It doesn’t seem right to call Geumyang over either.’\nI had told her in advance that I wouldn’t see her today because of the committee retreat.\nThough it didn’t feel like a committee retreat, calling Geumyang over today felt wrong.\n‘Should I drag the committee members over? No, that’s also not right.’\nAfter all, this quiet time was filling my heart with excitement.\nUnintentionally, I was spending a peaceful day at the campsite with Baek Seo. How could that not be happy?\nMoreover, their goal was for Baek Seo and me to spend time alone. Forcing them to come over would be a problem.\n“President.”\nLost in thought, I heard Baek Seo’s voice.\n“How are we going to sleep tonight?”\n“We’ll split the rooms. We need to decide who sleeps where. I don’t mind sleeping anywhere.”\n“Hmm…. I’ll take a last look around.”\n“Go ahead.”\nBaek Seo inspected the rooms and went upstairs. She then looked down at me from the second-floor railing.\n“President, come up here?”\n“Why?”\n“Just come up.”\nOkay.\nI got up from the sofa and headed for the stairs.\n“Turn off the lights.”\n“Why?”\n“You’ll understand when you get here.”\nTurning off the lights made the house pitch dark.\nStill, the lamps on the walls emitted a soft glow, allowing me to see around.\nI climbed the stairs to the second floor.\nBaek Seo was standing by the window, bathed in moonlight. She beckoned me over.\nA gentle breeze blew through the wide-open window. Since it was in the mountains, it was cool despite being summer.\nStanding beside her, I looked out the window.\n“Oh, quite….”\nA sky dotted with stars came into view. It was a sight rarely seen in the city.\nIt wasn’t dramatically beautiful, but the sheer number of stars was enough to excite anyone.\n“There are a lot of stars.”\n“Yeah. They’re pretty.”\n“The mountains make them more visible. It’s a shame they don’t photograph well.”\n“Why did you tell me to turn off the lights?”\n“Just because? It’s more atmospheric.”\nBaek Seo smiled contentedly.\n“…You’re excited.”\n“Not really.”\nAfter a while, we silently gazed at the starry sky.\nThen it hit me.\n“Come to think of it, we haven’t taken many pictures.”\nMaybe because it had been a while since such a situation, I had forgotten.\nAlso, Baek Seo wasn’t fond of taking pictures.\n“Should we take some now…?”\n“I’m ready.”\n“That was quick.”\nBefore I could suggest it, she had already taken out her smartphone and activated the camera.\n“Want to look here?”\nShe extended her arm holding the smartphone, capturing both of us and the view outside in the frame.\nBesides the moonlight, the charming lights unique to the campsite made it quite bright.\nFinding the right angle of reflection for the light, she subtly moved closer to me.\n‘Hmm.’\nA pleasant scent wafted from her neck.\nClick. Click.\nWe took a few photos with light gestures.\n‘The perfect subject.’\nNot me, but Baek Seo.\nShe seemed destined to be a commercial model.\nBut….\n“…Is it okay for us to take pictures alone? It’s a committee retreat, after all.”\nI asked out of nervousness from being so close to her.\n“Leaving such evidence might put us in a disadvantageous situation later for some reason.”\n“Because we look like a couple?”\n“Did you have to say it so bluntly…?”\nShe shattered my roundabout way of saying it out of embarrassment.\n“As I said before, I don’t mind.”\nI expected that answer.\n“Well… I was just saying.”\nWhat should I call this?\n‘It feels rebellious….’\nWe’re the president and vice president, supposed to lead by example.\nYet here we are at the committee retreat, taking cozy pictures together.\nWould we be treated as a couple?\n‘Disgraceful.’\nEven if we weren’t actually a couple.\nLeaving such circumstantial evidence would mean setting a bad example.\nOf course, it might just be a concern similar to a sense of professional ethics. Maybe even an obsession.\nMoreover, it’s a common cliché in various media that the disciplinary committee members are more morally corrupt than other students or frequently break the rules secretly.\n…No, that’s only in fiction.\nIn reality, a large and responsible disciplinary committee would feel guilty about such things.\n‘That’s probably why the Myunghyeon High School kids sneaked off to date.’\nThe result of committee members who couldn’t resist their romantic desires was right next door.\nThinking of them, my gaze naturally turned towards the other log cabin.\nIt came into view.\n“?” “?”\n…We made eye contact.\n‘Huh?’\nShin Ga-yeon, the vice president of Myunghyeon High School, sitting by the window.\nAnd… President Lee Jae-ho, who was engaging in affectionate behavior with Ga-yeon, met my eyes.\nWe were both ranked above 5th dan.\nBeing sensitive sometimes had its drawbacks.\n“…….” “…….”\nWe exchanged determined looks.\nIt was automatic.\n‘Let’s pretend nothing happened today.’\nMy intention seemed to get through, as Jae-ho nodded and slowly drew the curtain.\nI turned away from him.\n‘They’ve gone all the way….’\nMy facial muscles twitched.\nWere they aiming to fulfill their ultimate desires tonight?\nWere the president and vice president planning to completely disregard the rules?\nWere they planning to blatantly break the rules if they were going to?\n‘Should I take solace in not being at that stage yet?’\nThe thought that something would happen next door tonight filled my head. My vibrant imagination fueled by my youthful vigor caused heat to rise in my head.\nTrying to push the thought away, I looked at the back of Baek Seo’s head.\n“……?”\nShe was silently looking out the window.\nHer gaze was directed at the window of the next log cabin.\n“Did you see?”\n“…….”\nShe nodded without a word.\nHer face was as calm as a still lake. She looked like a sage who had attained enlightenment.\n“President, were we rivals with Myunghyeon High School?”\n“I think so…. You knew, right?”\n“Yeah?”\n“Hmm…?”\nThud.\nSuddenly, Baek Seo turned and pushed me against the window.\n“Baek Seo?”\nMy bottom hit the window sill, and my hands grabbed the window frame to keep from falling.\n“Stay still?”\nShe whispered softly in a private tone.\nThen she stretched her arms out on either side of me, gripping the window frame and looking up at me from a close distance. As if to prevent me from escaping sideways.\nA strange silence filled the air.\nBathed in moonlight, she stared into my eyes with that graceful face and then smiled slightly.\n“…What are you doing?”\nI half-closed my eyes.\n“Seeing the rival suddenly filled me with a sense of competition.”\n“In what way?”\nNo matter how I thought about it, it wasn’t in a healthy way.\nOf course, it was probably just a usual joke. That was my conscious thought.\nIt might just be a little stronger joke because we were alone.\nHowever…, in the current situation of being alone in a dark house, Baek Seo’s proactive attitude.\nThe mere thought of 'what if' deeply ingrained in my mind was enough to raise the heat in my body.\n“You know.”\nShe spoke.\n“I’m a girl too?”\nIt was a meaningful tone.",

      "content": "The circumstances and Baek Seo’s sultry whisper were making my heart race.\n“Wa-wait a minute….”\nMy words stumbled out, unbidden.\n‘Why is she being so aggressive?’\nI had occasionally fantasized about taking charge and kissing Baek Seo passionately.\nBut in reality, doing so without being in a relationship was out of the question.\nIf I acted impulsively, I, the president of the disciplinary committee, could end up being accused of a crime.\nMoreover, I still had responsibilities as a reincarnator and the president. I didn’t want to create a distracting element (a romantic relationship) at this point.\nRelationships should be built step by step for the excitement to last.\n‘What am I even thinking right now?’\nI was lost in sudden turmoil, my usual poker face on the verge of breaking in this intense atmosphere.\nHad I always been this weak…?\n“Is the president weaker than me?”\nHer unexpected question, as if reading my mind, made me swallow my breath.\nOf course, I didn’t show it.\n“Of course not….”\n“Then the choice lies with the stronger one, which is me, right?”\nWhat nonsense was this?\nSeeing her predatory, relaxed smile, my heart pounded wildly for various reasons.\n‘This is driving me crazy….’\nNo matter how much I controlled my expression, I couldn’t stop my face from flushing.\nPushing Baek Seo away or escaping wasn’t an option. I was still just a man.\nIn the end, I covered my mouth with my hand and looked away, not wanting to show my discomposed face.\nFor some reason, Baek Seo stopped moving as if she was holding her breath, her lips twitching.\n‘Calm down….’\nClear mind.\nI organized my jumbled thoughts and tried to calm my raging emotions, managing to compose my expression again. Then I looked at Baek Seo, trying to appear natural.\n“Vice President.”\nTo maintain my authority, I used her official title. My voice trembled slightly.\n“You’re not planning to engage in any behavior that would undermine our discipline, right?”\n“Like what?”\nWhat a sly fox.\nWas she trying to make me say it directly?\n“Things like… those behaviors between a man and a woman.”\n“Hmm.”\n“Such things should be done at least after you get a boyfriend, don’t you think?”\n“A boyfriend….”\n“It’s natural to feel desires as a human, and it’s also natural to feel strong urges after seeing those Myunghyeon guys. But it wouldn’t be wise to let that ruin our relationship.”\n‘Once’ is a harsh rule.\nIf my relationship with Baek Seo reached the point of fulfilling our desires even once, the psychological barriers would collapse. Then I wouldn’t trust myself to restrain anymore.\nThat’s why I desperately suppressed my desires, not falling for Baek Seo’s suggestive jokes.\n‘I don’t have the luxury.’\nTo capture all the six criminals and lead a peaceful life.\nAt least during my term as president, it was best to eliminate any factors that might cause me to lose focus.\n‘Am I rambling right now?’\nBut the structure of my words made sense, so I should consider myself fortunate.\nYeah, it’s still okay.\nCalm down.\nI won’t falter.\nI am the president of the disciplinary committee.\nBesides, Baek Seo had her usual playful expression, just like when she was joking.\nI could push her away like this.\n“We’re the president and vice president of the disciplinary committee. We shouldn’t behave like this.”\n“What would you do if I got a boyfriend?”\n“……!”\nSuddenly, an unpleasant image flashed in my mind, making my eyes widen.\n“Yes, that’s it.”\nBaek Seo, seeing my reaction, smiled contentedly and began to rise on her toes.\nShe closed her eyes and leaned her head towards me.\nTime seemed to slow down, and a whirlwind of thoughts spun in my head.\nMy body froze like a malfunctioning machine.\nAnd then.\nBaek Seo’s head veered to the side of mine.\n“Huh?”\nCrack!\nSuddenly, I heard a crackling sound. I turned my head towards it.\n“Sorry, President.”\nBaek Seo, with her head beside mine, extended her finger out the window. A trace of electricity lingered at her fingertip.\nIt was the power of her unique elemental magic, different from basic elemental mana.\nShe had lightly swung it, so there was no need to worry about penalties.\nI quickly turned my head in the direction she was looking and enhanced my vision with magic.\nThe other log cabin.\nThe place where I had seen Ha Yesong earlier, near the window.\nThere was a hole in the fluttering curtain caused by the wind.\nIt sizzled and cooled off in the breeze. It seemed to have been damaged by Baek Seo’s lightning strike.\nHa Yesong, who had fallen, looked at us in surprise. Soon, Park Minhyuk and Yoo Do-ha, who came to her aid, entered my view.\n“They were watching us closely. I set a trap for them. And I played a little prank. Though… it might have been a bit much.”\nBaek Seo said as she stood beside me.\nThe cold splash of reality brought clarity. Then came the rush of shame.\nAt that moment when Baek Seo approached, I had nearly lost myself in a flood of thoughts. I almost leaned in to kiss her.\nThe atmosphere Baek Seo created just now was that lethal.\nAhem.\nClearing my throat, I silently collected myself.\n“Yeah…. I had a feeling that was the case.”\n“Did you?”\nAt least you could have given me a heads-up….\nDon’t make me feel so embarrassed.\n“?”\nBaek Seo, who had tucked her hair behind her ear, let it fall back, covering her ear again.\nShe seemed to show a hint of disappointment on her face.\n‘Was it just a joke…?’\nI couldn’t bring myself to ask.\nAnyway, the sultry atmosphere dissipated, and naturally, the air became awkward.\n“…Shall we go fetch them?”\n“Yes, let’s.”\nAs I led the way down the stairs.\n“President.”\n“Yes?”\n“Don’t worry about me getting a boyfriend.”\n“?”\nI stopped in my tracks.\nI turned to look at Baek Seo, puzzled. She smiled her usual gentle smile.\n“As the vice president of the disciplinary committee, I wouldn’t date anyone else while you’re around.”\nHer response carried a double meaning.\n“…Is that so.”\nI decided to respond as the president of the disciplinary committee.\n“Then that’s a relief for me.”\nI was relieved.\nWhen the thought of Baek Seo getting a boyfriend crossed my mind, it felt like my insides were twisting.\nI narrowed my eyes and glared at her.\nSince she said it was a joke, as the president, I needed to scold her properly.\n“And don’t do that again. I’m a guy too.”\nEmbarrassment crept in, almost making me stutter. In the end, my tone remained calm, unlike when I scolded her.\nThere was a sense of incongruity, so I couldn’t even get angry.\n“Yeah…. I’m sorry. Will you forgive me?”\nBaek Seo’s eyebrows drooped.\nA humble smile spread across her face.\nShe seemed genuinely sorry. Understandably so, given that she had used her beauty to create a situation that would shake my heart greatly.\nOf course, I had to apologize too.\n“…I’m sorry too. I didn’t handle it well. I’ll be more careful next time.”\n“There’s no need for you to apologize….”\nShe trailed off and chuckled.\nI couldn’t bear to look at her face any longer and quickly turned my head forward.\n“Yes.”\nShe responded with a voice tinged with laughter.\n“I’ll be more careful next time.”\n“Alright.”\n“About the surroundings….”\n“Yes?”\n“Nothing.”\n……\n“President, we’re sorry!! We were just worried about your relationship with Baek Seo and…!!”\n“We committed a grave sin!!”\nHa Yesong and Park Minhyuk bowed deeply and begged.\nMeanwhile, Yoo Do-ha stood with her arms crossed, looking at them disdainfully.\n“…It’s fine. It’s good we’re all together like this.”\nI sighed and sat on Yesong’s back, crossing my legs.\n“President, you’re heavy…. This is school violence….”\n“Park Minhyuk, Yoo Do-ha. Who’s the ringleader?”\nMinhyuk and Do-ha pointed at Yesong.\n“You traitors! Don’t you have any camaraderie!?”\nYesong screamed.\n“Enough. Prepare some snacks.”\nMinhyuk jumped up and saluted, “Yes, sir!” while Do-ha asked, “What kind?”\n“You make bibim noodles with whelks.”\n“Right away.”\nDo-ha licked her lips.\nShe was crazy about ramen. Eating cool whelk bibim noodles on a summer day would put her in a good mood.\n“What about me, President…?”\n“The ringleader stays put.”\nYesong let out a small sound of resignation.\n“Heeey…. Baek Seo, help me…!”\n“Hang in there.”\nBaek Seo’s smile was firm.\n“The night is long. Since we’re all here, let’s start a proper committee retreat.”\nThe committee members responded positively.\nThat night, we played games similar to drinking games I’d only done in college in my past life.\nWe took many pictures, vented, and shared funny stories.\nI tried to maintain my image by holding back laughter, but occasionally my lips twitched up. Every time that happened, Yesong reacted excessively, as if seeking revenge.\nIt was quite enjoyable.\nThe forest at night was pitch dark.\nAs a result, the orange lights illuminating the campsite stood out even more.\nKim Dalbi couldn’t stand in the light. Her current relationship with Ahn Woojin was like the stark contrast between the brightly lit campsite and the dark forest.\nShe could only watch Woojin’s daily life while leaning against a tree in the darkness.\n“……”\nDalbi watched as Woojin and Baek Seo spent time together.\nWhether they realized it or not, the two were already feeling tender emotions towards each other.\nIt was a dazzling sight to Dalbi.\nShe couldn’t tell if the sensation of being pricked in the chest by needles came from a sense of loss or jealousy.\nShe could only watch their happiness, unable to do anything else.\nShe could hear the raucous voices of the Aseong High School disciplinary committee members from the log cabin. She didn’t know what they were saying, but it wasn’t important.\n“President, you laughed, didn’t you!? You laughed!? Wow! Park Minhyuk, take a picture!! It’s a chance to capture the president’s relaxed face!!”\nA female student’s loud voice rang out clearly. They seemed to be having fun.\nDalbi looked at the moon shining between the trees and imagined Woojin’s smiling face. The only smile she remembered was from their childhood.\nIt was a lovely smile.\n“Today seems fine.”\nDalbi quietly muttered to herself and walked deeper into the forest.\n……\nLate at night.\n“Cough…!”\nPrincipal Lee Doo-hee covered his mouth and repeated a phlegmy cough.\nHe looked down at his hand.\nThere was blood on it.\n“Shall I call a doctor?”\nA female student, Son Ye-seo, wearing a nun’s habit over her school uniform, asked with a bright smile.\n“What day is it today…?”\n“Today is….”\n“No, don’t tell me. I’ll remember….”\nHis ailing brain often lost track of time.\n“Never mind…. Put me in the wheelchair.”\n“Yes.”\nYe-seo helped Doo-hee into the wheelchair.\nWhirr. The wheelchair moved with a mechanical sound and stopped in front of the glass wall.\nDoo-hee took a quiet breath as he looked out at the view of Neo Seoul.\nHe had an IV in his arm.\nHis already frail body struggled with breathing.\nFor a while, he organized his thoughts.\nAs his lips, dry like a parched land, barely parted, he let out a labored breath and slowly spoke.\n“The more I think about it, the stranger it seems….”\n“What do you mean?”\nYe-seo responded from behind Doo-hee.\n“Kim Dalbi, Oh Baek Seo, and… ‘that girl’ are all intertwined with one boy.”\nYe-seo clapped her hands lightly.\n“You mean the president of Aseong High School?”\n“Yes…. All those kids are snarling over Ahn Woojin. Do you think this is just a coincidence?”\n“He must be a man of many sins. I saw him before; he was quite handsome.”\nYe-seo answered nonchalantly.\n“By the way, do you know you’ve said that five times now?”\n“…I see.”\nDoo-hee stopped speaking and took a deep breath.\nLooking at Neo Seoul, his thoughts finally came together.\n“Bring me Ahn Woojin.”\n“What?”\nYe-seo was startled by the unexpected order.\n“‘The Elder’ told us not to touch him, remember? You’ll get in trouble.”\n“The priorities have changed. Ahn Woojin, that boy… is no ordinary person. This kind of feeling is rarely wrong.”\nDoo-hee tapped the armrest of his wheelchair with his finger.\n“So we need to confirm it.”\nYe-seo nodded.\n“Then who should we send? If he’s the president, we’ll need to handle quite a bit of trouble.”\n“There’s a saying, ‘Use the right tool for the job.’”\n“Then I’ll choose someone appropriate.”\n“Exclude Kim Dalbi. She’ll only get in the way.”\n“Understood.”\nKim Dalbi would surely protect Ahn Woojin.\n“I don’t have much time left….”\nDoo-hee looked up at the ceiling, closed his eyes, and took a deep breath.\n“I need to do what I can before I go. Understanding Ahn Woojin is part of that.”\n“I know.”\nThe night deepened.",

      "content": "An Woo-jin recalled Moon Chae-yeon's ability.\n\"The power to create machines using electromagnetic waves.\"\nHer inherent ability, Electromagnetic Wave Shaping.\nThe ability to gather electromagnetic waves and shape them into mechanical structures, materializing them.\nInitially, it was the ability to create iron substances, but it evolved into the power of mechanical creation upon meeting Moon Chae-yeon.\nElectromagnetic waves acted as an energy source, channeling through Chae-yeon to power the machines she created.\n\"To interfere with electromagnetic waves, use Magic Formula Type 1, Wave Synthesis.\"\nThe power to attract and gather surrounding electromagnetic waves.\nBecause of this, Woo-jin's smartphone and the student council's call device had malfunctioned.\n\"Creating machines is Magic Formula Type 2, Cyber Kinetics.\"\nThe power to materialize electromagnetic waves into machines.\nThis was why it was never a good idea to fight a technomancer in the middle of the city.\nChae-yeon needed a significant amount of electromagnetic waves to fully utilize her abilities, and the city provided an ample supply.\n\"You can't come up here, can you?\"\nChae-yeon taunted from above with a mocking tone.\nIt was as if a bird, free to fly the vast sky, was mocking an ostrich.\nWithout replying, Woo-jin moved to uproot a roadside tree.\n\"Wow...\"\nChae-yeon admired.\n\"Hoo.\"\nWoo-jin took a deep breath.\nHe took a pitcher's stance, ready to throw the tree.\nThen, he hurled the tree towards Chae-yeon.\nWhoosh!!\nThe tree aimed precisely at Chae-yeon with rapid speed. Her board spewed fire and swiftly dodged the tree.\nChae-yeon's eyes followed the tree that passed her. It was a natural reaction.\n\"You can't hit me like... huh?\"\nWhile Chae-yeon was momentarily distracted, Woo-jin disappeared.\nCrack.\nAn unknown sound came from above. Chae-yeon quickly looked up.\nA figure wrapped in turquoise lightning was descending like a thunderbolt.\nIt was Woo-jin.\nOne hand held the Iron Dragon Staff, and the other gripped the Wall Crushing Rod.\nFor a brief moment, their eyes met.\n\"How? Teleportation...?\"\nFinally, Chae-yeon understood how Woo-jin had disappeared from the bathroom.\nHis inherent ability was undoubtedly related to teleportation.\nChae-yeon raised her arms and formed a shield in front of her. She converted and condensed the electromagnetic waves into energy, spreading it across the shield's surface.\nThe moment the shield took the impact, Woo-jin would be caught in an explosion.\nHowever, Woo-jin did not hesitate at all.\nThe lightning rods on the shield dispersed the electrical magic flowing from the Iron Dragon Staff, but Woo-jin swung the Wall Crushing Rod regardless.\nBoom!!!\nA ruthless explosion of electricity.\nThe deafening roar spread outwards.\nThe shockwave pushed away vehicles stuck in traffic congestion.\nCrash!!\nThe windows of the buildings shattered.\n\"Ugh...!\"\nWhoosh!\nChae-yeon's body was swept by the electric explosion, flying through the air. She crashed into the pavement, creating a crater.\nThe shield had already been destroyed.\n\"Handling the Wall Crushing Rod like this... Interesting!\"\nChae-yeon had known Woo-jin wielded the Wall Crushing Rod and that its power was unrivaled.\nBut she hadn't expected this level of power.\nIt surpassed the limits of the Wall Crushing Rod.\n\"Huh?\"\nThen, Chae-yeon noticed the turquoise glow hadn't disappeared.\nShe looked up.\nIn the air, Woo-jin, enveloped in strong electric magic, was descending. His hair and clothes fluttered violently.\nThe electric explosion from the Wall Crushing Rod had compressed back into a bizarre scene.\nThe magic flowed like a dragon, forming a stream of electricity.\nZzt!!\nAll the magic followed the movements of the Iron Dragon Staff, as if Woo-jin were conducting an orchestra.\nIt was perfectly controlled by Woo-jin.\nAnother effect of Iron Dragon Staff Technique No. 1.\nThe reuse of electric magic flowing in the air.\nChae-yeon smiled broadly and tried to create an insulating shield.\n\"Huh?\"\nBut it was difficult to fully utilize the gathered electromagnetic waves. The flow of magic was disrupted. She quickly understood why.\n\"An EMP. This is why I dislike dealing with electricity users.\"\nWoo-jin had swung the Wall Crushing Rod first.\nTo disrupt the flow of electromagnetic waves gathering towards Chae-yeon with an electromagnetic pulse caused by the electric explosion.\nIn a city where electromagnetic waves flowed continuously, the effect was temporary.\nBut the brief gap was enough for Woo-jin to launch an effective attack.\nIt was clear that Woo-jin's subsequent barrage of attacks was deliberate.\nHowever, Chae-yeon was a formidable opponent.\nHer response speed and countermeasures were swift.\nHer flying board rose immediately to protect her. It was a temporary measure, but its high magic concentration made it very durable.\nWhoosh!\nA large lightning rod suddenly protruded from the board. It had been designed that way from the beginning.\nChae-yeon had prepared her countermeasures in advance.\nWoo-jin spun his body and swung the Iron Dragon Staff.\nBoom!!!\nThe rotating stream of electricity followed the movement and shot towards Chae-yeon like a spear.\nThe thick electric spear carved a streak of light in the air, targeting the lightning rod.\nBang!!\nIt collided with Chae-yeon's defensive measure, causing a fierce explosion of magic.\nThe impact sent Chae-yeon's body flying like a ball. She crashed through a nearby building and tumbled into the first-floor hall.\n\"Ahhh!\" \"Ah!\"\nThe employees in the hall were shocked. The AI robots sounded alarms.\n\"Whew.\"\nChae-yeon stood up and brushed off the dirt from her clothes. Her internal organs and bones were injured, but it wasn't unbearable.\n\"This is unexpected.\"\nChae-yeon realized Woo-jin hadn't used his full strength yet.\nAnd yet, this much power.\n\"If he awakened his inherent ability not long ago, he must be at least Fifth Rank... This power is at least Sixth Rank.\"\nUntil a moment ago.\nChae-yeon had thought Woo-jin used his wits and creative means to handle Han Seo-jin.\nShe assumed Han Seo-jin had let his guard down, which led to Woo-jin's victory.\nThat's why he won, she thought.\nBut after directly clashing with Woo-jin, her perception changed.\n\"Can't take him lightly.\"\nChae-yeon had underestimated Woo-jin, but no more.\nShe couldn't let her guard down.\n\"Oh, this is fun...\"\nClick!\nChae-yeon created mechanical armor over her body with her now-normalized inherent ability. A new flying board formed at her feet.\nSnap!\nShe snapped her fingers.\nMeanwhile, Woo-jin landed on the road.\nThe citizens and drivers, realizing the battle situation, were urgently fleeing.\nSecurity robots, having lost their signal, autonomously assessed the situation and began controlling the roads.\nWhile Woo-jin was yelling and gesturing for the remaining citizens to evacuate quickly.\n\"……!\"\nWhoosh!\nRobots burst out through the shattered windows of a large shopping mall. They were the robots Chae-yeon had brought and stationed.\nThey each switched to flight mode and aimed their guns.\nRatatatatat!!!\nA barrage of magic bullets rained down on Woo-jin.\nThere was no place to escape.\nIt was too late to flee by creating a crack.\nWoo-jin quickly stomped the ground.\nCrackle!!\nThen, using the Iron Dragon Staff, he deflected some of the magic bullets and escaped to the lower part of a nearby building.\nAt that moment.\nWhoosh!!\n\"Where are you going!?\"\nChae-yeon, clad in mechanical armor, instantly flew towards Woo-jin.\nIt was in the blink of an eye.\nShe had enhanced her flight speed to the extreme by bursting wind magic.\n\"!\"\nWoo-jin was shocked; he hadn't expected her to be that fast. It was completely different from what he'd seen in the game.\nChae-yeon aimed at Woo-jin with a mechanical spear in her hand. Strong energy and condensed wind magic swirled around the spear.\nThe energy released was so immense that the trees and asphalt along her path were crushed.\nEven a Sixth Rank expert wouldn't survive the spear's blow.\nBefore Woo-jin could make any judgment, he turned his body and swung the Iron Dragon Staff filled with electric magic.\nCrash!!!\nThe two weapons didn't collide.\nOnly the densely packed magic and powerful energy of the Sixth Rank experts clashed in the air.\nThe Iron Dragon Staff shattered the mechanical armor and penetrated Chae-yeon's torso.\nThe mechanical spear pierced Woo-jin's oblique muscle.\nThe compressed wind magic in the spear was about to explode. It would inflict a fatal wound on Woo-jin in an instant.\nThere was no time to think.\nInstinctively, Woo-jin channeled magic into his oblique muscle.\nBoom!!!\nA shockwave erupted.\nBoth of them were sent flying in opposite directions. Crash! Woo-jin slammed into the building's exterior wall, and Chae-yeon tumbled across the road.\n\"Ugh...!\"\nChae-yeon spat blood.\nHer abdomen was in excruciating pain.\nShe realized she had been electrocuted as well.\nHer body didn't move as she wanted.\nWithout the mechanical armor, she couldn't imagine the state she'd be in... The thought was terrifying.\n\"Seriously, what is he...?\"\nWith blood flowing from her mouth, Chae-yeon smirked. She looked towards Woo-jin.\n\"Ugh...\"\nWoo-jin groaned in pain, clutching his pierced oblique muscle. The impact of hitting against the wall had taken its full toll on him.\nAt the moment the spear pierced him, he poured all his magical power into reinforcing his oblique muscle.\nHis seasoned battle instincts had saved him. Without them, he would have already been on his way to the afterlife.\n\"As expected, this isn't enough to kill him.\"\nChae-yeon had suspected that Woo-jin wouldn't die from such an attack.\nThat's why she had used an attack capable of killing a person.\n\"Oh, how it hurts...\"\nHow long had it been since she felt such pain?\nChae-yeon laughed quietly.\nHolding her injured abdomen, she staggered and stood up.\n\"Still, all that's left is to capture him...\"\nShe had been constantly interfering with the electromagnetic waves.\nReporting the incident in this area was impossible.\nMoreover, the police and the academy wouldn't be able to promptly assess the situation.\nChae-yeon walked towards Woo-jin to capture him.\n\"What?\"\nSuddenly, Chae-yeon felt a strange sense of unease and stopped.\nAt that moment.\nPew!\nFrom a distance, arrows imbued with magic rained down.\nBang!\nEach arrow precisely pierced and exploded Chae-yeon's robots.\n\"What...?\"\nThe tall buildings had obstructed her view, causing her to realize too late. She was astonished.\nAn inherent ability, Laplace's Demon.\nMagic Formula Type 1, Precision Equation.\nThe ability of Yoo Do-ha, the treasurer of the Asong High student council.\nAll the arrows boasted incredible accuracy thanks to the archer's calculations.\n\"W-Woo-jin sunbaenim...!\"\nSuddenly, a boy in a plaid shirt and glasses, looking like an otaku, appeared.\nHe ran to Woo-jin and began healing him with magic.\nIt was Park Min-hyuk, the secretary of the Asong High student council.\n\"Thank you...\" \"Don't speak, just stay still! The wound will reopen...\"\nRat-tat-tat-tat!\nSeveral student council vehicles arrived, firing magical bullets at Chae-yeon.\nShe flew into the air, using the fire from the board beneath her feet.\nThe vehicles stopped, and members of the second platoon of Asong High disembarked. They were armed and ready for battle.\n\"How did the Asong High student council arrive so quickly?\"\nChae-yeon was confused.\nThey couldn't have arrived this fast.\nBoom!\nThe student council's long-range attacks continued. Arrows rained down again, destroying Chae-yeon's robots.\nThe physically enhanced student council members jumped from buildings and attacked Chae-yeon. Combat machines on the vehicles also fired at her.\nChae-yeon smirked, dodging or blocking the attacks with her shield.\n\"What a nuisance.\"\nEach attack was precise. Chae-yeon bit her lip. She couldn't get close to Woo-jin.\nThe pain in her abdomen constantly reminded her of Woo-jin's strike with the Iron Dragon Staff. This made it difficult to quickly respond to the concentrated attacks from the student council.\n\"...So that's it.\"\nChae-yeon finally understood.\nWhile she didn't know exactly what Woo-jin's special ability was, she was sure it was something related to teleportation.\nSo, when Woo-jin had entered the men's restroom.\nHe could have teleported outside the mall, called the student council from a zone without interference, and then returned.\nThis explained the sequence of events.\n\"Of course... He knew about my ability from the beginning.\"\nIf he hadn't known about her ability, such a swift response would have been highly unnatural.\n\"I knew they had good intelligence, but I didn't expect it to be this good.\"\nChae-yeon felt intrigued by Woo-jin.\nHowever, this interest was tinged with hidden anger.\n\"How dare you.\"\nVeins bulged on Chae-yeon's forehead.\nAt first, she hadn't thought much of Woo-jin.\nBut now, she had a strong desire to crush him.\n\"Haa!\"\nMeanwhile, a girl leaped out of a student council vehicle and stood before Woo-jin and Min-hyuk.\n\"In a moment of crisis, Ha Ye-song enters the fray!\"\nIt was Ha Ye-song, the student council leader.\nShe turned to Woo-jin and pointed at herself with her thumb.\n\"Woo-jin sunbaenim! Leave it to me from here!\"\nShe proclaimed with confidence.\nWoo-jin and Min-hyuk's eyes widened for a moment.\n\"She doesn't inspire confidence at all...\" \"Yeah, shut up, Park Min-hyuk.\"\nWoo-jin smirked at their conversation.\nHe patted Min-hyuk on the shoulder.\n\"Sunbaenim?\"\nThe first aid was successfully completed. Now he wouldn't die from blood loss.\nHe still had strength left to fight.\n\"You saved my life.\"\nWoo-jin gripped the Iron Dragon Staff and moved forward again. He met Chae-yeon's gaze and used electric magic once more.\n\"This isn't going to work...\"\nChae-yeon realized she couldn't defeat her opponents in the current situation. The difference in power was significant.\nShe acknowledged her mistake.\nShe had underestimated Woo-jin.\n\"...I admit it.\"\nChae-yeon mentally addressed Woo-jin.\n\"You are strong. Much stronger than I thought.\"\nAcknowledging Woo-jin's strength, Chae-yeon raised her mechanically armored right arm.\nSuddenly, something hidden behind the clouds began to fall rapidly.\n\"……!\"\nWoo-jin's eyes widened.\n\"Prepare for defense!! Everyone else, fall back!!\"\nThe student council obeyed his command without question.\nSome members of the student council brought out large shields and enveloped them in magic. The others quickly retreated. Their movements were practiced.\nWoo-jin grabbed Ye-song and Min-hyuk and urgently fled.\n\"Oh, Woo-jin sunbaenim!!\"\nYe-song screamed, feeling the approaching threat from the sky.\nIn the meantime, Woo-jin turned his head and locked eyes with Chae-yeon.\n\"See you again,\" her lip movements said.\nA flying object, like a meteorite engulfed in flames, descended from the sky.\nBoom!!!\nA massive explosion reverberated through the area.\nThe ground shook, and the powerful wind destroyed the exterior walls of nearby buildings.\n\"Ahhh!!\"\nYe-song screamed as she was thrown back. Woo-jin hugged Min-hyuk and Ye-song, rolling across the ground.\nFinally, when everything calmed down.\n\"Are you okay!?\" \"Yes...!\"\nWoo-jin checked Ye-song and Min-hyuk's condition and turned his head towards where Chae-yeon had been.\nThe settling dust.\nChae-yeon had already disappeared.",

      "content": "The injured were urgently transported to the hospital.\nI was among them.\nWhat I received from Park Min-hyuk was merely first aid.\nI needed to receive professional treatment quickly.\nSoon, Deputy Chief Oh Baek-seo arrived at the scene.\nAs soon as he saw me, his face turned pale.\nIt seemed he had difficulty hiding his emotions, unlike usual.\nI left the cleanup of the scene to Ha Ye-song and instructed Baek-seo to track down Moon Chae-yeon. I was taken to the hospital with Min-hyuk as my guardian.\nThere was no need to worry about Yoo Do-ha.\nDue to the penalty of his inherent ability, he would suffer from severe dry eyes and become a fool, but each time that happened, he would hide in a safe place. As a side note, I had never seen Do-ha in his foolish state.\nAnyway, the student council split into two teams.\nA team led by Baek-seo went to track down the villain Moon Chae-yeon, while another team handled the cleanup and investigation at the scene.\nAnd time passed.\nWe received a report that Moon Chae-yeon had completely escaped.\nIn the end, the pursuit was terminated.\n……\nI was told it would take at least two weeks to fully recover. That was considering my recovery abilities.\nTypically, the stronger one's magic, the faster they healed.\nHowever, I also heard that without the first aid, I might have died or taken much longer to recover.\nI didn't even want to imagine what would have happened if I had faced Chae-yeon alone without any help.\nMore importantly...\n“……”\n“……”\nHow should I deal with this awkward atmosphere...\nIn a private hospital room.\nBaek-seo was silently peeling fruit, sitting in the guardian's seat.\nI hadn't done anything wrong.\nBaek-seo just seemed deep in thought, making it difficult to start a conversation.\nBesides,\n'We lost the Sixth Criminal...'\nIt wasn't something to be proud of...\n“I'm sorry.”\nBaek-seo suddenly spoke.\n“What are you talking about?”\n“I should have arrived sooner. At least if I had been there, you wouldn't have ended up like this, right?”\n“Don't say that.”\n“Huh?”\n‘You make it sound like I'm incapable of catching villains without you...’\nIt was a blow to my pride as the chief.\nI couldn't depend on the deputy chief.\nFailing to capture Chae-yeon with the forces on site was purely my fault.\n“You were far away. What could you do?”\nWhile I was at the shopping mall, Baek-seo was quite a distance away.\nBaek-seo could move very quickly, but there were limits. He had to cover most of the distance on foot.\nGiven that, he arrived incredibly fast.\nWherever he had been, it seemed to be a private matter.\n“The important thing is what happens next.”\nI tried to move my upper body, but intense pain in my side made me stop.\nIt felt like I was going to die from the pain.\nWithout showing it, I lay back down and stared at the hospital ceiling.\n“The Sixth Criminal targeted me for some reason and will definitely come after me again. We need to be prepared.”\nIf I met Chae-yeon again and failed to capture her, it would be a disgrace to my position as the student council president.\nMy reputation would be damaged, and my future would be threatened.\nI had to capture Chae-yeon no matter what.\n‘Why does nothing go according to plan...’\nIn my life,\nI've worked hard, so can things go my way just once...\nIt's not like I can blame anyone else.\n‘At least I can take solace in the fact that I can fight Chae-yeon at this level.’\nIn the past, I couldn't even imagine that.\nNow, I could fight on equal footing with Chae-yeon. I was stronger than I had expected.\nBut there was a problem.\nChae-yeon hadn't shown her full power yet.\n‘In the second round, she’ll definitely bring out Chimera...’\nIt was clear that in the future, Chae-yeon would deploy her combat weapon, Chimera.\nWe needed a thorough countermeasure.\nWe had to prepare for the worst-case scenario.\n‘If only we could find her hideout.’\nWe didn't know where Chae-yeon's hideout was.\nIn the game, meeting the Six Criminals was only possible during predetermined events.\nBut we couldn't just sit around and wait. We needed to start searching.\n“Chief.”\n“Huh?”\nBaek-seo suddenly leaned closer.\nHis shadow fell over me. A gentle smile spread across his face.\n“Rest for now. Don’t think about anything else. You're a patient, after all.”\nHis voice was soothing, calming my mind.\nI appreciated the concern, but I couldn't just rest aimlessly.\n“I'm not in a position to do that, am I?”\n“Rest.”\n“……”\nDespite the gentle tone, it felt somewhat forceful.\n……\nI calmed my breathing and focused on circulating my internal magic. Like meditating.\nWhen I closed my eyes, a vivid scene played out on the dark canvas of my mind like a movie screen. The cityscape where I had fought Moon Chae-yeon.\n‘If I had set the coordinates correctly...’\nWhen Chae-yeon dropped the aircraft, if I could have created a crack at the exact location...\n‘If I could have made a large crack at once...’\nIf I could have created one huge crack.\nI could have prevented the explosion and Chae-yeon's escape.\nSetting coordinates accurately and creating a wide-radius crack in one go was still difficult for me.\nThere was also the option of using Spatial Lightning Strike to destroy the aircraft.\nBut that method had high risks.\nIf the aircraft was destroyed, debris would rain down like a storm.\nBlocking each piece of debris would require immense skill in setting coordinates. It was a level far beyond my current capabilities.\nSo, prioritizing escape on foot was the best option.\nThe more I thought about it, the more I regretted not being fully trained in my inherent ability.\n‘If I could have stopped it.’\nIn my imagination,\nI reached out towards the aircraft Chae-yeon had dropped.\nI repeatedly visualized creating a crack and sending the aircraft to a different location in my mind.\nMy internal magic reacted to my desire, surging within me.\nMy whole body was drenched in sweat.\nThe vivid setting, the intense emotions, and the honed senses guided me into a singular focus.\nThe pain in the spot where Chae-yeon had stabbed me surged, but I could endure it.\n‘Just a little more.’\nRelying on my senses, I drew the scene in my mind over and over.\nEventually, my stamina would deplete, and I would lose consciousness.\nThough there was no penalty to bear, the repeated practice alone left me exhausted.\nBut I couldn't stop.\nIn a situation where Chae-yeon had gauged my strength and would bring out Chimera, my chances of winning would drastically decrease.\nI couldn't help but become impatient to grow stronger.\n‘Ah.’\nHow many hours had passed?\nI unintentionally drifted off to sleep.\nLate at night.\nThe dark hospital room.\nBaek-seo entered the room. He saw An Woo-jin sleeping.\nHe turned off the bedside lamp, leaving only the faint moonlight filtering in.\nBaek-seo carefully brushed Woo-jin's hair, as if handling something precious.\nThough worried about the sweat pouring off Woo-jin, he decided not to worry, knowing it was part of training his inherent ability.\nAfter a while.\nBaek-seo left the hospital room and headed to the bathroom.\nThe bathroom at midnight was dimly lit.\nIt was quiet and lonely.\nBaek-seo washed his hands at the sink and looked into the mirror.\nA girl with long hair and wearing black clothes with an emotionless expression reflected in the mirror.\nShe wore dark clothes to blend into the night.\nIt was the appearance of Baek-seo from the days of Sparta.\nPerhaps due to the penalty of her inherent ability, Baek-seo's eyes sometimes grew cold, reflecting her past.\nThe girl in the mirror seemed to say.\nYou are this kind of person.\n“……”\nBaek-seo bowed her head.\nThe flowing tap water reflected in her view.\nShe recalled the enemies targeting Woo-jin.\nBaek-seo knew they were all subordinates of the Grand Principal.\nWhen she faced Kim Dal-bi on Shin Yongsan Street, she had somehow managed to fend her off.\nBut while Han Seo-jin and Moon Chae-yeon were pushing Woo-jin to the brink of death, what had she done?\n“Ugh…”\nShe hadn't protected Woo-jin.\nThere were times she might not have been able to act in time, and Woo-jin could have died. Multiple times.\n“Haa.”\nBaek-seo let out a small sigh.\n“I didn't come next door for this…”\nDuring the practical evaluation.\nWhen Han Seo-jin deployed the barrier, when she couldn't defeat the monster she summoned, the helplessness she felt...\nThe image of Woo-jin being carried away in an ambulance, bleeding profusely from being stabbed by Moon Chae-yeon, came rushing back to her mind.\n‘Why are you so indifferent?’\nShe recalled Woo-jin, who remained calm despite those incidents.\nAs if it was natural to experience such things.\nIt wasn't natural.\nEven for a student council president, it didn't make sense to go through such events repeatedly.\nWhy was this?\nBecause the opponent was Grand Principal Lee Doo-hee.\nBecause he was the mayor of Neo Seoul.\nBecause the threats, like wild dogs, were constantly targeting Woo-jin.\nWoo-jin couldn't possibly know this.\n“……”\nA string in Baek-seo's mind seemed about to snap.\nShe entrusted the guardian role to Ha Ye-song and Park Min-hyuk and went home.\nBaek-seo's home.\nInside, it appeared ordinary, but there was a hidden place.\nIf Woo-jin had deliberately searched the house, he would have found it. He had a keen eye.\nThat's why she had insisted he not help with moving the furniture.\nMoreover, when Woo-jin had seen her naked in the shower and fled, he hadn't had time to inspect the house.\nCreak.\nShe moved the bookshelf aside, revealing a door. She unlocked it and entered.\nThe place Baek-seo had hidden was a small weapons cache.\nThe walls were filled with information about her investigative process and the Grand Principal.\nHidden treasures of information she had secretly collected from distant areas filled the room.\nThe reason she hadn't arrived quickly at the scene of Woo-jin's fight with Chae-yeon was due to her investigation.\nBaek-seo took out a pistol that handled magic bullets from the weapons storage.\nThe cold touch and heavy weight felt in her hand.\nShe brought the pistol close to her ear and checked the loading sound.\nClick.\nIt was fine.\nBaek-seo gathered her sword 'Baekryun-do', lethal weapons, top-quality magic bullets from black mermaids outside the city, extra magazines, a silencer, and combat magical tools.\nAfter that, she sat at her desk.\nOn the desk was a piece of paper with simple personal information about Oh Baek-seo.\n[Resignation Form]\nName: Oh Baek-seo\nAffiliation: Student Council\nPosition: Deputy Chief\n...\nIt was a resignation form she had prepared since last time.\nBaek-seo caressed the resignation form and whispered softly.\n“I have to protect Woo-jin…”\nThere was something she had to do.\nIt might take some time.\nBaek-seo couldn't give up on that task.\nThat task was.\n‘I have to eliminate the Grand Principal.’\nHer goal was to kill the current Grand Principal, Lee Doo-hee.\nOriginally, she had planned to gather more solid information and act in the second semester.\nBut since the Grand Principal was targeting Woo-jin for some reason, Baek-seo felt the urgency.\n‘Woo-jin can't know about this.’\nIf Woo-jin found out about Baek-seo's plan, he would either stop her or join her.\nNeither option was good for Baek-seo.\nWoo-jin would be continuously exposed to life-threatening situations.\nSo, this resignation form meant she would return after completing the task and share a future with Woo-jin.\nIt was Baek-seo's resolution.\nHowever.\n“……”\nBaek-seo lowered her head.\n“No, I guess I don't need this…”\nClunk.\nShe opened the trash can and discarded the resignation form.\nAs if nothing had happened, she would return while Woo-jin was still hospitalized.\nBaek-seo armed herself and left the house.\nThe darkness of the night enveloped her.",

      "content": "Zone Zero. Neo Seoul's 'Zone Zero' was called that.\nBeyond the beautiful flower fields. In stark contrast.\nQuiet, dark, foggy, and eerie ghost towns were the landscape of Zone Zero that people knew.\nIt was a strictly closed-off area, officially known to be uninhabited.\nThis was because of the pervasive miasma from monsters and radiation that contaminated living organisms.\nNeo Seoul is a safe land.\nA few places in the world are safe from monster attacks, thanks to the mercy and blessing of the Golden Sheep, and Neo Seoul was one of them.\nHowever, Zone Zero was officially outside the boundaries of that safe land, a common knowledge widely spread in society.\nIt was said that the boundary of the Golden Sheep's blessing was unclear, and such a mistake occurred during urban development.\n…This was a false common knowledge.\nZone Zero was also a land blessed by the Golden Sheep.\nOnly a few people in the city knew this fact.\n“Ah…, it hurts….”\nThe medical facility was located in the middle of the desolate city center.\nIt was an abandoned hospital, and only the subordinates of the Grand Principal resided there.\nMoon Chae-yeon lay in bed, chuckling to herself.\nShe was receiving treatment and resting. However, the continuous pain was unavoidable for the time being.\n'That guy is ridiculously strong...'\nChae-yeon recalled An Woo-jin, the head of the student council at Asong High.\nShe couldn’t forget the moment the Iron Dragon Staff hit her abdomen squarely.\nIt had been a long time since she experienced a warning in her head saying 'dangerous.'\n'He's definitely not just a Fifth Rank. At least a Sixth Rank.'\nTo inflict effective damage on her, at least upper Fifth Rank level magic was needed.\nWith this level of powerful force, it had to be at least Sixth Rank or higher.\nShe turned her head and looked out the window.\nThe dull gray city landscape came into view.\n'Is this the result of being careless...?'\nChae-yeon chuckled to herself.\n“I didn’t want to come to such a dreary place again.”\nThe sky was also gloomy as if it was about to rain.\nIt could be described as an ashen city.\n“How unpleasant...”\nThe lack of electromagnetic waves made it difficult for her to fully utilize her abilities.\nThe scenery itself was chilling and filled her with repulsion.\nMoreover, being here inevitably reminded her of her childhood.\nBabies classified as top-grade after being measured for innate magic were sent to facilities in Zone Zero. Chae-yeon was no exception.\nShe could never forget the things she experienced afterward, even if she wanted to.\n'Still, I like the quiet and the lack of surveillance.'\nZone Zero, being an abandoned area, rarely had security robots.\nIf someone found security robots in Zone Zero, they would undoubtedly be suspicious.\nWhile she was lost in her thoughts.\n“You shouldn’t be here...!”\nWhack! Thud!\nThe guards outside the hallway who were protecting Chae-yeon seemed to be caught up in some commotion, but she didn’t care.\nClick. Creak.\n“What’s happening?”\nChae-yeon asked without turning her head.\n“Huff, huff…”\nThe person who entered the hospital room was a woman with cherry blossom-colored hair.\nShe was panting heavily and bleeding profusely.\nBlood was smeared on her fresh-colored hair.\nIt was Kim Dal-bi, one of the Six Criminals.\n“Judging by the look of you, you must have defied the Grand Principal?”\nChae-yeon spoke, looking at Dal-bi’s reflection in the window.\n“What’s the reason? Because you messed with the Asong High student council president?”\nChae-yeon asked nonchalantly.\nDal-bi approached Chae-yeon without answering. The sword in her hand faintly reflected the dim light of the room.\nChae-yeon turned her head towards Dal-bi and smirked.\n“You came here to deal with me because you couldn’t have a proper conversation? Then you should have killed the guys outside first. Don’t tell me… you’re still holding onto that ridiculous non-killing principle?”\nChae-yeon shrugged provocatively.\nDal-bi’s eyes had a murderous coldness.\n“I’m not going to kill you. I just want to make sure you can’t fight anymore.”\n“What’s your plan? Touching me now is a clear act of treason, isn’t it?”\n“If it comes to this, I have to commit treason.”\nSring.\nDal-bi raised her sword.\n“You broke your promise.”\nShe swung the sword.\nSwish!\nAt that moment, black particles rose up and formed an arched mechanical shield to protect Chae-yeon.\nIt was a defensive measure shaped by the reserved electromagnetic waves.\nClang!\nThe sword and the shield collided with a clear metallic sound. A strong wind blew around due to the clash of magic.\nAs if she expected it, Dal-bi tried to launch another attack.\nThen Chae-yeon swiftly got off the bed and engaged in a brief but skillful exchange of blows with Dal-bi.\nAfter a short scuffle, they ended up in a deadlock, their arms locked together.\n“Ah, it hurts...”\nChae-yeon groaned.\nThe harsh movements made her abdomen feel like it was about to burst. She openly showed her pain.\nIt was clear that if the fight continued here, Chae-yeon would lose.\nHowever, Chae-yeon provocatively glared at Dal-bi.\n“Hey, don’t you think it’s too much to target a patient?”\n“……”\n“You always have this problem. You’re like a beagle. Selfish and an expert at causing trouble for others, right?”\nDal-bi snorted.\n“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”\n“You’d be the type to cling and obsess over everything in a relationship. Doesn’t the Asong High student council president hate you too? Oh, yeah. I heard you guys had a big fight last time? You keep getting close to someone who already avoids you? What? You’re just protecting someone you like? You’re the one who dealt with all the idiots approaching An Woo-jin, right? Wow! Amazing, Kim Dal-bi!”\n“What do you know?”\nDal-bi’s face, covered in blood, showed a mocking smile. But her eyes were far from smiling.\n“Don’t you get it? That’s stalking, stalking. You’re just a criminal, a pathetic stalker.”\nThis time, Chae-yeon laughed.\n“Dal-bi? Do you think only you want to pursue love and dream of a happy life? We were out of place from the moment we were dragged to the Grand Principal, no, from the moment we were born.”\n“…I can’t listen to this anymore.”\nDal-bi snorted and tried to push Chae-yeon and swing her sword.\nWhoosh!\n“!”\nIn an instant, a man entered the hospital room and kicked Dal-bi in the head.\nAlready exhausted and solely focused on Chae-yeon, Dal-bi couldn’t react in time.\nBang!!\nDal-bi’s body flew and crashed through the hospital wall, falling outside the building.\nThe man who kicked Dal-bi jumped out through the broken wall and flew towards her.\nIn midair, Dal-bi barely held onto her fading consciousness and gripped her sword again.\n“Safe, aren’t you?”\nShortly after, a girl in a nun’s habit entered the hospital room. It was Spartoi Son Ye-seo.\n“Sigh…”\nChae-yeon sighed deeply and leaned against the wall. Ye-seo bent down and looked at her.\n“Are you okay?”\n“Almost died. My ability is highly dependent on the situation. Here, I’m practically the weakest.”\nChae-yeon grumbled.\nThe wind crawled in through the broken wall. Outside, the howls of goblins and the sounds of battle could be heard.\n“Why don’t you just get rid of that beagle?”\n“I heard she’s a top-grade. Unfortunately, Dal-bi is more valuable than you, Chae-yeon.”\nChae-yeon fell silent at the mention of top-grade.\n“Chae-yeon?”\nYe-seo called out in suspicion, and Chae-yeon looked nonchalant, gazing at the broken wall.\n“She’s not even using her ability? Look. Tsk. She’s already beaten. She looked exhausted from the start.”\n“That’s understandable. She was chased by Hong-gyu and had a fight with our strongest member before that.”\n“Seo Gang-jin?”\n“Yes.”\nA man known to be the second strongest in Neo Seoul after Goliath.\nIt was Spartoi Seo Gang-jin.\n“No wonder she’s in that state.”\nJust knowing she fought Seo Gang-jin explained why Dal-bi ended up in such a mess.\n“He wouldn’t have let anyone go…. Right after leaving it to Hong-gyu, Dal-bi must have escaped?”\n“Exactly. But she can’t run away anymore.”\nOutside the building.\nThe ground and buildings around were disjointed.\nSeveral goblins were pinned against rocks, covered in blood.\nIn the midst of it, Dal-bi was shackled to a rock structure, in tatters.\nA red-haired man glared at Dal-bi with furious eyes.\nOne of Neo Seoul’s Six Criminals.\nOne of the twin glutton siblings, Hong-gyu.\n“Kim Dal-bi.”\nHong-gyu stared at Dal-bi.\nDal-bi hung her head, blood dripping down. All she could do was cling to her consciousness.\n“Do you think I’m a pushover?”\nHong-gyu spoke irritably, raising his trembling hand.\n“If you’re going to resist, you should give it your all, right? You haven’t given up just because you’re weaker than me, have you? Huh? Right now! Transform into a goblin!”\n“I... won’t.”\n“……”\nThud!\nHong-gyu punched Dal-bi’s abdomen.\nThen, he grabbed her hair and lifted her to meet her eyes.\n“Cough...!”\n“Still afraid of the penalty? Just for such a trivial reason?”\nHong-gyu’s fiery rage turned icy cold.\n“I’m wasting time that I could spend with my sister on someone like you…? Because of your stubbornness. Shouldn’t you at least show some sincerity?”\n“……”\n“Hah.”\nAs if tired of it, Hong-gyu released the magic that formed the rock structure and kicked Dal-bi.\nThud!\nIt sounded like kicking a soccer ball.\nCrash!\nDal-bi’s body flew and crashed into an abandoned building.\nDal-bi, already exhausted after confronting the Grand Principal, had no strength left to resist Hong-gyu.\n“The Grand Principal has a message for you, despite everything. You’re not being abandoned. Your mission remains. Merciful, isn’t it?”\nHong-gyu scoffed and pointed at Dal-bi.\nIn the rising dust, Dal-bi leaned her head against the building’s exterior wall, coughing and gasping for air.\n“Tch. Reflect on your actions. I’m leaving now.”\nHong-gyu spat on the ground in disgust and walked away.\nMeanwhile.\n“Is there a need to leave her like that?”\nChae-yeon spoke as she lay down on the new bed Ye-seo had arranged.\n“No matter how good her ability is, it’s useless if she doesn’t use it, right? And she keeps defying the Grand Principal, so is it worth keeping her alive? She’s not even a double-edged sword.”\n“Dal-bi will eventually use her ability.”\n“How?”\nYe-seo clapped her hands lightly and put the back of her hand to her cheek.\n“The Grand Principal has plans. Especially for someone as emotional as Dal-bi, she’s easy to handle.”\n“Huh…”\nThere was nothing more to say about the Grand Principal.\nChae-yeon stared at the new hospital ceiling.\n“…But what kind of penalty does Kim Dal-bi have that she restricts her ability so much?”\n“Well, you see.”\nYe-seo briefly explained the penalty of Dal-bi’s inherent ability.\n“Ah…, if it’s her, that makes sense.”\nChae-yeon responded indifferently, turning her head toward the window.\nRaindrops began to fall on the window one by one.\n……\nHeavy rain pounded the pavement.\nKim Dal-bi clutched her broken arm and dragged herself forward. Blood and dirt were washed away by the rain.\nIt was already dark.\nThe ashen city was enveloped in darkness, and Dal-bi relied on her adapted vision and senses as she walked.\n“Huff, huff…”\nShe had lost a lot of blood.\nAfter fighting the strongest among the Grand Principal’s subordinates, she had exhausted almost all her magic.\nYet her heart still beat.\nHer nose and mouth still breathed.\nThinking that all these life activities were maintained by the Grand Principal’s mercy, Dal-bi felt humiliated.\nBut she had to survive now. Only then could she achieve her plan.\nSo she just kept walking.\nWhile passing through an alley, the shortest route to escape Zone Zero.\nThud.\nHer legs gave out.\nBarely crawling on the ground, she propped herself up against a building wall. She decided to wait there until she regained her strength.\n“Huff, huff…”\nDal-bi panted.\nIn the meantime, Chae-yeon’s voice echoed in her head.\n─ ‘You’d be the type to cling and obsess over everything in a relationship. Doesn’t the Asong High student council president hate you too?’\n─ ‘You keep getting close to someone who already avoids you? What? You’re just protecting someone you like?’\nDal-bi snorted.\n“Ah, that hit a nerve…”\nClinging.\nCould there be a word that suited her more?\nShe couldn’t deny it.\n“Sigh…”\nThe sound of the rain.\nThe sound of wind escaping through her lips broke the silence.\nDal-bi looked up at the dark sky pouring rain. Soon, a wry smile formed on her lips.\n“What am I doing…”\nShe would someday bring the Grand Principal to ruin.\nThat determination would not change.\nIf so, what if her plan succeeded?\nWhat then?\nThe image of Woo-jin and Oh Baek-seo looking affectionate naturally came to mind.\nBlessed by the heavens, the two were dazzlingly bright together.\nUnlike them, she remained in dark and gloomy places.\nWoo-jin had Baek-seo.\nHe had the student council, students who admired him, and many friends.\nThere was no place for Dal-bi by Woo-jin’s side.\nThere was nowhere to return to.\nAt that moment.\nSplash, splash.\nThe sound of footsteps splashing through puddles.\nA deliberate, intentional sound turned Dal-bi’s head.\nSring.\nA sword was drawn from its scabbard, and the blade caught the rainwater.\nThe one holding the sword was a woman who once sided with the darkness.\nA short-haired woman.\nOh Baek-seo approached Dal-bi with a cold gleam in her eyes.\n“The heavens are indifferent…”\nDal-bi’s lips curled up.\nI had a nightmare.\nAs soon as I woke up, the content of the dream faded from my memory, but it was clearly a vivid nightmare. Somehow, my consciousness was searching for Baek-seo and Dal-bi.\nWiping the cold sweat off my forehead, I looked around.\nHa Ye-song was sleeping with her head down on my bed.\nPark Min-hyuk was sleeping on the other side of the room.\nBaek-seo was nowhere to be seen.\n‘Where did she go?’\nIt was 2 a.m.\nI felt bad calling at this hour, but a sense of foreboding made me dial Baek-seo’s number.\nThe ringing continued for a while until the voicemail message blared in my ear.\n[The number you have dialed is not reachable. Please leave a message after the beep.]\nI ended the call and shook Ye-song’s shoulder.\n“Ye-song.”\n“Uh, um, just one more bite…”\n“Ye-song.”\n“…Yes?”\nYe-song woke up, rubbing her sleepy eyes and looking at me.\n“Chief…? You’re awake…?”\n“Where’s Baek-seo? Where did she go?”\n“She said she had something to do… She asked me to tell you she won’t be around for a few days if you woke up… Seems like something urgent came up…, oh? Chief!?”\nI pulled out the IV and used space leap to exit the hospital room.",

Where did she go?”\n“She said she had something to do… She asked me to tell you she won’t be around for a few days if you woke up… Seems like something urgent came up…, oh?

      "content": "I knew well the reason why Baek Seo moved next door.\nIt was to protect me.\nNo matter how much I thought about it, I couldn’t shake off the feeling of overprotection.\nIt felt as if he knew exactly what threat was targeting me.\nDespite his intense desire to protect me, Baek Seo left without telling me, even though he would be away for several days.\nIt was a suspicious move.\nAt that time, I was seriously injured after fighting with Moon Chae-yeon, following fights with Kim Dal-bi and Han Seo-jin among the six sinners.\nIt was easy to guess what kind of worries Baek Seo might have had at this timing.\nIn other words.\nWhat if Baek Seo decided to take down Moon Chae-yeon, or remove a greater threat? What if he intended to act alone?\n‘He probably thought I would definitely stop him if he told me in advance.’\nI could guess the reason why Baek Seo left without a word.\nOf course, there was no solid evidence. It was purely a hunch.\n‘The question of why Baek Seo is trying to act alone without borrowing the power of the disciplinary committee remains unresolved.’\nSo... I could only hope that my guess was wrong.\nI tried to contact Baek Seo two more times, but the call did not go through.\n[ An Woo-jin : Where are you? ]\nThere was no reply.\n“Hoo….”\nAfter several space leaps.\nAs I emerged from the rift created in the air, a dark house came into view. It was Baek Seo’s house.\nNot knowing where Baek Seo had gone, I came here grasping at straws.\n‘He strongly opposed me coming here, didn’t he?’\nIt felt inappropriate to invade his privacy, but I could apologize later.\nFor now, there were other priorities.\nClick.\nI turned on the light and looked around.\n‘... It’s clean.’\nIt was a neat and ordinary room, to the point where I couldn’t understand why he was reluctant to let me in.\nIt might be an excessive thought, but I even glimpsed an obsessive cleaning habit.\n“?”\nA flower on the desk caught my eye.\nA peony in a water bottle. It was withered.\nThe flower had dried and become a dry flower.\n─ ‘Do you know the language of the purple peony?’\nLast semester, while preparing for the midterm exam.\nBaek Seo’s question about my peony amulet came to mind.\n‘I thought the question felt unnatural.’\nNow I seemed to understand why Baek Seo asked about the language of the purple peony.\nPerhaps this withered peony was also originally purple.\n‘The language of the purple peony is… anger.’\nI couldn’t understand why he kept the peony like this.\nI looked around again.\n“Hmm?”\nA strange sense of emptiness emanated from the direction of the bookshelf.\nUpon closer inspection, there was an unnatural finishing line on the flooring under the bookshelf.\nI used my unique ability to set coordinates on the opposite side of the bookshelf.\nCrack.\nA rift was created.\n‘The coordinates are set...? It usually doesn’t work if there’s no space on the other side?’\nThis meant there was space behind the bookshelf.\nI immediately leaped through the space.\n“......?”\nI lightly generated electricity with my fingers and looked around. When I saw the light switch, I turned it on.\nThe light flickered weakly before illuminating fully.\nMy eyes widened.\n“What…?”\nNeatly stored lethal weapons. A row of combat magical tools.\nAs I moved my head along the weapons, something even more surprising filled my view.\n“......”\nA mind map and all sorts of information covering one wall.\nIt was all about Principal Lee Doo-hee.\nI stood in front of the information-covered wall and quietly examined the contents.\nMy emotions gradually cooled down over time.\n‘I expected it…, but it was true.’\nMy brows furrowed.\nEventually, my speculation turned into certainty.\nRecalling the magical engraving on Baek Seo’s arm.\nShe had been an elite agent, a Spartoi, a hunting dog of the Principal.\nAlthough she seemed to have gained freedom from the Principal for some reason, the cause was unknown.\nAlso, judging by the mind map, I was sure. Baek Seo’s current goal was to assassinate the Principal.\nThe motive seemed to be... revenge.\n‘So that’s why.’\nI seemed to understand why Baek Seo had been overly protective of me, and why she disappeared in the original work.\nIt all made sense.\nIf Baek Seo had left alone, I could understand why she didn’t need the power of the disciplinary committee.\nBecause the opponent was the Principal.\nIt was better to move alone discreetly rather than attracting attention with the insufficient power of the disciplinary committee.\nIn the original work, Baek Seo would have carried out her plan.\nAnd judging by the fact that Baek Seo could not be found after the Principal’s suicide, it seemed she had met an unfortunate event during the execution of her plan.\nShe likely didn’t leave Neo Seoul. It would only lead to a hellish place where survival was difficult.\nMoving to another place blessed by the Golden Sheep was also impractical.\nSurviving until then… it was nearly impossible unless you were a Goliath.\n‘One gun is missing.’\nAmong the slots where firearms were fitted according to their shapes, one slot was empty. Baek Seo must have taken it.\nLooking around further, I noticed a trash can. The end of a piece of paper was sticking out from under the lid.\nI opened the trash can and saw a crumpled piece of paper. I took it out and checked it.\n“……!”\nI gasped.\nThe paper was Baek Seo’s withdrawal application.\n[ Reason for withdrawal ] ─ Due to personal reasons, I am withdrawing, but I will return soon.\nThe phrase ‘I will return soon’ was written.\nBaek Seo could have taken a short leave of absence.\nIt seemed she was planning to leave the school for a while for reasons unrelated to the disciplinary committee or the academy curriculum.\nHowever, seeing that she had not submitted the withdrawal application and threw it away in the trash.\nShe might have experienced some change of mind and resolved to come back soon.\nMoreover, if I had seen the withdrawal application, the outcome would have been obvious.\nI would have definitely tried to find out what was wrong and naturally set out to help Baek Seo.\nBaek Seo probably expected that too.\n“......”\nThe approval section for the disciplinary committee head and the student council was empty.\nAnyway, even if this withdrawal application had been submitted, I would have rejected it.\nIt wasn’t that she wanted to withdraw; she had no choice.\nI put the paper back in the trash can.\nI had no intention of feeling disheartened. I immediately began to carefully examine the mind map Baek Seo had organized.\n“Kid.”\nEventually, I heard a woman’s voice from behind.\nIt was Golden Sheep.\n“…You knew from the beginning, didn’t you?” “Roughly.”\nI didn’t question why she didn’t tell me. It was obvious I would be in danger.\nTo Golden Sheep, the priority was me. There was no reason to protect Baek Seo.\n“I told you, didn’t I?”\nGolden Sheep said.\n“Baek Seo is like a cheesecake precariously balanced on a pair of chopsticks. It was all fine because you were supporting her. But with you being targeted by the Principal’s henchmen, could she have stayed sane?”\nGolden Sheep clicked her tongue.\n“Besides, she’s a kid who’s stained her hands with a lot of human blood. It’s more comfortable for her to move alone.” “Yeah, I know. I think so too….” “Don’t look for Baek Seo.”\nGolden Sheep cut off my answer and spoke firmly.\nThere was frost in her voice.\n“You’re not in a position to do anything right now. If you don’t want to die in vain, stay still.”\nI knew it was a warning.\nFacing the Principal with my current state was absurd.\nThe reason I aimed to become the head of the disciplinary committee was to deal with the six sinners one by one.\nGiven the possibility that the six sinners, except Goliath, were on the Principal’s side, and that even the strongest Spartoi was the Principal’s subordinate.\nIt was easy to foresee a future where not only I but the entire disciplinary committee would be buried if we all stepped forward.\nBut…, it was too harsh a sight before my eyes to stay still.\nI had fully grasped the contents of the mind map.\nI speculated about Baek Seo’s potential actions and thought together with my game knowledge.\nSuddenly, the memory of tirelessly searching for the missing Kim Dal-bi, wearing out the soles of my shoes, overlapped with this moment.\nI couldn’t just sit still.\n“If I don’t die, it’s fine.”\nI turned around and started walking.\nMy heart had cooled astonishingly.\nAt this moment, I felt like I wouldn’t be afraid of anyone.\nShoo-shaa.\nA dark alley. The rain was soaking Baek Seo and Kim Dal-bi.\nDal-bi leaned against the wall, looking at the grim reaper before her.\nA person holding a white wheel sword in one hand and a silenced pistol in the other. Dressed in black to blend into the darkness. It was Baek Seo.\nBaek Seo looked the same as in her past hunting dog days. There was no trace of mercy in her eyes.\nDal-bi spoke with a struggling smile.\n“You know….”\nPuh-sook!\nThe blade of the white wheel sword, imbued with magical power, pierced Dal-bi’s thigh.\n“Ugh…!”\nAs sudden, excruciating pain surged, Dal-bi bit her lip to stifle her scream. Blood trickled down her bitten lips, mixing with the rain.\nBaek Seo put weight on the white wheel sword that pierced Dal-bi’s thigh and stepped on Dal-bi’s ankle.\nIf Dal-bi resisted even slightly, the white wheel sword would cut through her body.\nIf she made any loud noise, a bullet would pierce her neck.\n“You annoyed me.”\nBaek Seo’s cold voice flowed with the sound of rain.\n“It seems unforgivable that you tried to touch Woo-jin.” “Really…? That’s good….”\nDal-bi’s body trembled from the cold as her body temperature dropped.\nHaving lost a lot of blood and being soaked by the cold rain.\nEven so, a faint smile curved on Dal-bi’s lips.\n“Me too. I guess you’ve been bothering me too….”\nDal-bi honestly expressed her feelings.\nBut she didn’t say why.",

      "content": "A+.\nThat was the grade given to Baek Seo.\nChildren born in the factory were graded based on their innate magical power.\nChildren who received an A+ grade were separately classified and transported to facilities in the forbidden Zero Zone.\nBaek Seo was no exception.\nIn the Zero Zone facility, Baek Seo was held by mechanical devices and forced to repeatedly undergo special training methods.\nLater, it was revealed that this was a form of training to awaken their talents, a deteriorated version of the magical power cultivation method designed to enhance the quality of magical power indirectly.\nThe mechanical devices poured magical power into the children every day.\nEvery single rough and thorny magical molecule relentlessly enveloped Baek Seo.\nBaek Seo screamed every time, but no one came to help.\nThe children had no freedom.\nNeo Seoul's Principal, Lee Doo-hee, knew that performing magical power cultivation in infancy was essential to creating the best talents.\nShe called it the 'Golden Time.'\nIf an infant could instinctively grasp the magical power cultivation method during the Golden Time, they could achieve growth unmatched by anyone else.\nThis was the secret of the so-called new humanity.\nFurthermore, this process boasted the highest efficiency and stability.\nHowever, it was impossible to teach infants, who couldn't even speak, the efficient magical power cultivation method in a conventional way.\nOnly one person had instinctively grasped the magical power cultivation method during the Golden Time.\nA man considered the greatest genius in human history, expected to reach Argonaut at an early age—Goliath.\nTherefore, the method devised by Principal Lee Doo-hee was to achieve a similar effect to the magical power cultivation method.\nThis involved forcibly enveloping the children in dense magical power and letting it seep into their bodies.\nConsidering the survival rate, the subjects were children born with at least A+ grade magical power.\nIt was tantamount to torture.\nTo achieve higher efficiency, strong stimuli were necessary.\nIn the process, many children whose magical circuits were destroyed and whose blood flowed backward were discarded.\nTo Principal Lee Doo-hee, it was no more psychologically impactful than drinking plain water.\nCreating one good talent was overwhelmingly more efficient than raising all the A+ grade children.\nTo her, it was just an opportunity cost.\nBaek Seo survived the Golden Time.\nHowever, what the Principal desired was a talent at the level of Goliath.\nBaek Seo didn't come close, but she met half of the Principal's criteria. Thus, she was considered a semi-success.\nNo more forced training was necessary.\nHowever, Baek Seo's mind was already broken.\nIn the middle of the facility, she spent her time repeatedly clashing the same toys together, wrapped in bandages and staring lifelessly at the floor, suffering from aphasia.\nThen she met Kim Dal-bi.\nBaek Seo would look at Dal-bi whenever she heard her voice.\nWhen their eyes met by chance, Dal-bi would smile brightly.\nFeeling awkward, Baek Seo would avoid her gaze.\nEach time, Dal-bi's smile would seep into Baek Seo's heart.\n‘Hello!’\nOne day, Dal-bi greeted Baek Seo cutely with a smile.\nThis was after all the other children they had been with were discarded.\n‘We know each other, right?’\nThe two children quickly became close, perhaps because they had survived the same ordeal.\nDal-bi frequently hugged Baek Seo.\nThat warmth restored the light in Baek Seo's eyes.\nThe Principal allowed Baek Seo and Dal-bi to play like ordinary children, just like other semi-successful children.\nBaek Seo and Dal-bi, for the first time, saw the small but beautiful flower garden outside the prison-like facility.\nThe desolate area near the Zero Zone.\nA place always seen through the window but never experienced.\nThe blue sky and the view of the flower garden excited the two children for the first time.\nThat day, Dal-bi picked up a purple peony and said,\nAccording to the book, the flower's meaning was ‘anger.’\nProud of her knowledge, Dal-bi confidently put her hands on her hips.\nThe reason this moment stood out in Baek Seo's memory was that she realized something.\nLike a misaligned gear, something had been wrong since birth.\nBeing born couldn’t be this painful.\nThere were so many beautiful things in the world.\n‘Ah.’\nBaek Seo finally understood the unknown emotion that had been rising within her.\nSoon, Baek Seo picked up a purple peony.\nShoo-shaa.\nThe sound of rain washed away the memories of the past.\nPresent time. A dark alley.\n“Honestly, you really annoyed me….”\nDal-bi's voice, soaked with blood, mingled with the sound of rain.\nDespite the aggressive words, Baek Seo remained indifferent.\n“Me too. We’re similar.” “Hehe…, we really have no affection for each other….”\nDal-bi stared intently at Baek Seo.\nThe same kind face that exchanged affectionate glances with Woo-jin overlapped.\nWhether in the past or now, Baek Seo always shone brightly in Dal-bi's eyes.\nThe sense of incongruity Dal-bi felt when looking at Baek Seo became clear.\nSuddenly, a new question arose in Dal-bi's mind.\n‘That's right….’\nDid it really have to be her protecting An Woo-jin?\nThere was someone strong, bright, and fond of Woo-jin right beside him.\nBaek Seo’s bold actions must be to protect Woo-jin’s daily life.\n‘What am I… in this mess….’\nCompared to that, what about herself?\nAs Moon Chae-yeon said, Dal-bi was just a stumbling block for Woo-jin.\nShe had become a woman clinging to the past like mud.\nDal-bi's lips curved into a faint smile.\nHer intelligent eyes and cunning smile faced Baek Seo’s ruthless face.\nHer thoughts had been organized.\n“Why are you here…? No, let me guess. You’re here to deal with the disciplinary committee head's followers this time, right…?”\nComing all the way to the Zero Zone, it was clear she intended to deal with Moon Chae-yeon.\nBaek Seo did not deny it.\n“You, you picked the wrong time…? Today, it would be better to do nothing…?”\nYou should leave here now.\n“By looking at your ragged state, I can tell. There must be several people of the Principal around.”\nBaek Seo spoke.\nThe Zero Zone had minimal surveillance by the Principal.\nThat’s why Baek Seo and Dal-bi could talk freely.\n“You seem to have been beaten like a dog for defying the Principal.” “Hey, that’s too harsh…. There are better comparisons….”\nDal-bi laughed, “Hehe.”\n“I have something to ask you.”\nBaek Seo spoke firmly.\n“What is it…?” “Why did you leave me? I haven’t heard your reason yet.” “Oh.”\nDal-bi thought for a moment before smiling.\n“You mean that time? When we were asked to decide who would leave between us….”\nBaek Seo nodded.\nDuring their childhood, a Spartoi, a subordinate of the Principal, proposed to Baek Seo and Dal-bi.\n─ ‘One of you become my dog. In return, I will let the other go outside.’\nThe decision was left to the two children.\nThe one who spoke first would be given the choice.\nBaek Seo and Dal-bi promised not to betray each other.\nBut after Baek Seo woke up,\n─ ‘Kim Dal-bi chose first. She left at dawn.’\nHearing this from an AI robot, Baek Seo’s mind went blank.\nShe confirmed Dal-bi's empty room. Her eyes darkened.\nIt was a memory Baek Seo could never forget.\n“I told you before…. It would be meaningless to tell.” “It’s important to me.”\nBaek Seo couldn’t shake off the words that Dal-bi had left her.\nShe didn’t resent Dal-bi for it.\nAll the blame was on the Principal.\nOnly the question of ‘why?’ repeated in her mind.\nWhy did Dal-bi leave first without saying a word? Baek Seo wanted to know.\n“…Let me ask again. Did you want to escape here so badly that you left me?”\n“……?”\nAfter a moment, doubt filled Dal-bi’s eyes.\n“What do you mean…? That I escaped here?” “What?” “I was the one who decided to become the dog…?”\nA sense of dissonance.\nA peculiar feeling of incongruity hung in the air as their conversation diverged. Both realized their conversation had gone awry.\nIn her childhood, Dal-bi recalled secretly visiting the Principal at dawn and saying,\n─ ‘We won’t follow your orders. We know you intend to keep us here anyway.’\n─ ‘I see…. You’re clever. So, what do you want?’\n─ ‘Please set Baek Seo free.’\nDal-bi bowed.\n─ ‘Please.’\nAfter a while, the Principal remained silent, so Dal-bi raised her head.\nThe Principal was laughing.\nIt was an extremely unpleasant and grotesque smile, like seeing a ridiculous scene.\nDeep wrinkles folded as he laughed.\nAt dawn, the Principal’s subordinate took Dal-bi away.\nThus, Dal-bi and Baek Seo parted without even saying goodbye.\n“……?”\nDal-bi’s expression of confusion left Baek Seo puzzled.\nWith her trained ability, Baek Seo read the subtle changes in Dal-bi’s expression. There was no unconscious change in expression indicative of lying.\nFinally, an alarm went off in Baek Seo's mind.\nThe sound of realization.\nShe understood the vague suspicion she had vaguely guessed.\n“Haa….”\nA deep sigh escaped from Baek Seo's lips.\nDal-bi tilted her head, still looking at Baek Seo with puzzled eyes, as if unaware of Baek Seo’s activity as a hunting dog.\nIt was definitely.\n‘It was a ruse.’\nThe Principal wanted obedient children.\nThus, he made the two children his dogs with a simple and cowardly trick.\nThe Principal had no intention of giving up either Baek Seo or Dal-bi. Both were precious experiment subjects and semi-successes.\nThe two children in their youth couldn’t possibly know that.\nBaek Seo's thoughts were organized.\nThe remaining questions too.\nThe sense of loss that had haunted her thinking Dal-bi had abandoned her was also cleared.\nSwoosh!\nThe blade of the white wheel sword was pulled out from Dal-bi’s thigh.\n“Ugh…!”\nDal-bi bit back a scream.\nBaek Seo immediately attached a medical magical tool to Dal-bi’s thigh. The pierced area was sealed, compressing and stopping the bleeding.\nIt was for emergency treatment.\n“Why suddenly…?” “I heard that you left me.”\n“What…?”\nBy now, Dal-bi couldn’t help but understand.\nShe had always thought Baek Seo was living freely.\nBut it seemed the person in question had perceived it differently.\n“It was strange. Even after you left my side, you became a terrorist. So, I had to confirm with you directly….”\nWhile Baek Seo was speaking.\nSuddenly, the air became heavy, and a wave of powerful magic brushed past Baek Seo and Dal-bi’s skin.\n“!” “!”\nTheir eyes widened.\nCrash!!\nSuddenly, between the rooftops of the buildings, an arch-shaped ice barrier formed, covering the night sky.\nBeautiful and large snowflake-shaped patterns floated on the magical ice chunks.\nAt the same time, the path leading to the opposite side of the alley was completely frozen, blocking their way.\nBaek Seo and Dal-bi looked up simultaneously, guessing the situation.\nFor some reason, someone they shouldn’t meet had appeared here.\nClick-clack.\nThe sound of high heels echoed clearly.\nBaek Seo and Dal-bi turned their heads in the same direction.\nFlowing with hazy cold air like a melody, a silver-haired male student in a white uniform approached.\nAn eerie sensation enveloped Baek Seo and Dal-bi.\nThe man's cold eyes seemed to freeze everything.\n“Why…? I thought he had left for something…?”\nDal-bi looked at the white-haired man in disbelief.\nThe man who had subdued Dal-bi as a consequence of defying the Principal.\nThinking he had assigned the task to Hong Kyu, one of the six sinners, and left, but he had unexpectedly appeared.\n“…….”\nBaek Seo composed herself and assumed a combat stance.\nThere was no way her movements had been detected.\nIn other words,\n“You knew I would come here….”\nThe Principal must have known that Baek Seo would act.\nThe reason why Han Seo-jin, one of the six sinners, had been monitoring Baek Seo.\nThe aftermath that would follow if An Woo-jin was taken through Moon Chae-yeon.\nThe Principal had anticipated everything and set the trap.\n“It’s been a while, Baek Seo.”\nThe person known to be the strongest after Goliath in Neo Seoul.\nThe strongest among the Principal’s subordinates.\nSpartoi of the 7th rank.\nCold air flowed from the lips of the white man, Seo Kang-jin.\nIt was highly unnatural for him to be here after releasing Dal-bi and withdrawing.\nEven Baek Seo had been more vigilant about Kang-jin’s movements than anyone, like a landmine.\nKang-jin’s appearance here could only be seen as the Principal’s ploy.\nIt was hasty. She moved too hastily.\nHowever, Baek Seo showed no signs of bewilderment on her face.\nShe only refined the magic circulating within her body.\n“…Hello.”\nBaek Seo gathered her magic.\nEven though the future ahead was clear.\nMeanwhile, An Woo-jin was running around, repeatedly making space leaps.\nHe had searched every place, including Aseong High School, where Baek Seo might be, but her whereabouts were nowhere to be found.\nThe past of running frantically to find Kim Dal-bi filled Woo-jin's mind repeatedly.\nThe helplessness from back then gripped Woo-jin's mind and drove him to run madly.\nWoo-jin gasped for breath and struggled with penalties, unable to even contact Golden Sheep. Pain couldn’t stop his steps.\nBefore long, the rain clouds receded, and the sun began to rise over the horizon. The dim sunlight cast over the gray city.\nThe Zero Zone. On the debris of several collapsed buildings.\n“Ke…ugh….”\nBaek Seo was frostbitten all over her body and covered in blood.\nBaek Seo barely lifted her heavy eyelids and looked at Kang-jin with thinly opened eyes.\nIn her blurred vision, she couldn’t make out anything properly.\nDal-bi had already been knocked unconscious by Kang-jin.\nSeeing Dal-bi trying to help Baek Seo, he had made her lose consciousness beforehand.\n“The Principal was wary of you too, Baek Seo. Knowing you would target him someday.”\nA female student in a nun’s outfit, Spartoi Son Ye-seo, said while supporting the unconscious Dal-bi.\n“But… you were too hasty, Baek Seo. Did you think the Principal would only target Woo-jin?”\n“…….” “Kang-jin. Dal-bi should be locked up until she calms down. I’ll take her with me.”\nKang-jin gave no response.\nYe-seo nodded lightly and left with Dal-bi.\nKang-jin quietly observed the defeated Baek Seo. She struggled to move her body. However, her already battered body did not respond to her will.\nSoon, the light faded from Baek Seo’s eyes. Her consciousness went black.\nDrip.\nCold blood trickled down Kang-jin’s cheek. It was from the wound Baek Seo had inflicted.\nWiping his cheek with his gloved hand, the red blood smeared on the glove.\nKang-jin took off the glove and threw it at Baek Seo before turning around and walking away.\nHeading in the direction where Moon Chae-yeon was standing, looking indifferently at Baek Seo.\n“The Principal ordered me to. Extract Unsa’s ability. Starting today.”\nMoon Chae-yeon asked Kang-jin.\n“I’m struggling with penalties right now, so it’ll take about a week.” “Do it as soon as possible.” “So, Baek Seo is to be disposed of?”\nKang-jin walked away without answering.\nHe showed he didn’t want to talk.\nChae-yeon let out a bitter laugh and shook her head.\n[…….]\nThe small goblin hiding in the alley turned to smoke and disappeared.",

You can't trust it, Leader!\"\nCould it be a trap?\n\"I don't think so.\"\nI leaned towards the side that it wasn't.\nJust like any major academy's jurisdiction, Ma Hyun High School's jurisdiction was very broad.\nIf they were trying to lure me into a trap, would they have answered so vaguely?\nIn the first place, why would Kim Dal-bi go to the trouble of sending a lower-grade goblin to tell such a lie?\nIt was a highly unnatural situation.\nIt meant there was an interest I didn't know about behind this incident.\n‘Even if it’s a trap, there's no choice.’\nThere was no way to find out Baek Seo's whereabouts immediately.\nI couldn't refuse even if it was a trap.\nAfter all, I had the ability to teleport. I could escape if necessary.\n[Good! Mission accomplished since I told everything!]\nHaving said everything, the lower-grade goblin shouted joyfully, stretching its arms upwards.\nSoon, its body started turning into smoke from the toes up. It was leaving because it had completed Kim Dal-bi's order.\n\"One more question. Why did Kim Dal-bi send you?\" [I don't know...! She said to take Baek Seo.] \"What? Wait...!\"\nThe lower-grade goblin completely turned to smoke and slipped out of my hand.\nA goblin whose purpose isn't combat cannot be caught anyway. How could I stop it from disappearing?\nThe night breeze brushed my skin.\nSoon, a question surfaced in my mind.\n‘Does Kim Dal-bi... wish for Baek Seo to be safe?’\nWhether with good intentions or bad,\nIt seemed that Dal-bi didn't want Baek Seo to face any misfortune.\n‘I don't know.’\nI couldn't guess the reason at all.\nLet's set aside the question that I can't find an answer to.\n\"Did you hear?\"\nSquatting on the windowsill, I asked the executives.\n“Yes…. Can we trust that?”\nYe-song asked, looking bewildered.\n\"I’ll go even if it’s a trap. I can escape if something happens.... Hm?\"\nAt that moment, I sensed movement below.\nThe executives and I looked down.\nWe saw students setting up an air cushion.\n\"Hey, Senior!\"\nA female student cheerfully waved at me. It was Lee Se-ah, squinting her eyes as usual.\nOn closer look, the students setting up the air cushion seemed to be from the Volunteer Club.\n“Hey! Are you planning to make an extreme choice as the discipline committee head?”\n“Haha…! If you’re having a hard time, we’ll kindly counsel you…!”\n“Hehe…! Jump, senior! If you’re confident in going to the afterlife, then jump! Let’s see who wins!”\nWhat the heck...? What are they doing here...?\nBzzz.\nSuddenly, my smartphone vibrated.\nSeeing Se-ah fiddling with her smartphone, it seemed she had sent the message.\nI checked immediately.\n[Lee Se-ah: Senior~ I came to stop your suicide!] [Lee Se-ah: But I think I saw something strange]\n[An Woo-jin: It's nothing]\n[Lee Se-ah: It seemed like something though?] [Lee Se-ah: Anyway, let's talk about it later] [Lee Se-ah: Are you looking for Baek Seo?]\nMy whole body tensed.\n‘What…?’\nHow did she know?\n‘Did she guess by looking at my state?’\nI recalled that Se-ah had found me and informed the executives.\nThough I didn't know how she found me, anyway.\nI had been a mess earlier, and Baek Seo hadn't been with me for days. Se-ah could have easily guessed.\nSe-ah had enough information-gathering ability to find me.\n[An Woo-jin: So you’ve been watching me all along]\n[Lee Se-ah: Of courseㅋㅋㅋ] [Lee Se-ah: We're stalkers to each other, aren’t we?] [Lee Se-ah: I really like this relationship ㅎㅎ]\n[An Woo-jin: …]\n[Lee Se-ah: I'll send the kids back] [Lee Se-ah: Should we discuss it?]\n......\n\"Emergency air cushion~. It boasts excellent performance. I often carry anti-suicide tools. You never know when you’ll encounter someone with strange thoughts on the street, right? Though I didn't expect it to be you, senior. It’s really good to be alive!\"\n\"......\" \"Are you perhaps moved by the junior who cared for your life?\"\n\"No.\"\nThe discipline committee's office.\nI brought Se-ah and served her tea. She sent the other Volunteer Club students back.\nThe discipline committee members watched Se-ah quietly. Except for Yoo Do-ha, no one seemed wary.\n\"She looks like a doll.... No wonder the leader is so into her.... Ouch!\"\nYe-song's nonsense was interrupted by Min-hyuk's chop to the back of her head.\n\"Be considerate...!\" \"What did I do...!\"\nYe-song and Min-hyuk bickered in low voices.\nSe-ah watched them with a bright smile.\n\"Thank you. You are beautiful too, senior.\" \"Me?\" \"Yes. You're lovely.\" \"Hmm..., hehe. You're saying the obvious...!\"\nEmbarrassed, Ye-song giggled at Se-ah's flattery. She was weak to compliments.\nShe looked stupid to me.\n\"......\" \"......\"\nMin-hyuk and Do-ha silently glared at Ye-song as if they were dumbfounded.\n\"So, you ran over when you saw me by the window?\"\nI asked while sitting across from Se-ah.\nI leaned back and crossed my arms.\n“Yes. We were having a gathering after finishing our night volunteer work. Our room is right across, so we saw it well.” “I see…. Did I look like I was about to jump?” “You’ve been a mess lately, haven’t you? Someone as perfect as you suddenly falling apart like that, of course, it raises suspicions.”\nIt was convincing...\n“Moreover, I didn’t see Vice Leader Baek Seo, who’s always with you. So, I wondered if there was a serious issue between you two.” “Leader.”\nDo-ha called out to me.\nIt wasn't a nuance of wanting to talk.\nBaek Seo's disappearance was the discipline committee's issue.\nIt wasn't good to inform people outside the committee.\nOnce you speak out, you can't take it back. Moreover, this incident was very sensitive.\nIn short, it was prudent not to blab to outsiders.\nIt could cause unexpected problems.\nSo, Do-ha was signaling me not to talk about it.\nBesides, Do-ha seemed not to trust Se-ah.\nFrom my experience, Do-ha's intuition was never wrong.\nIt could be correct this time too.\nSe-ah was destined to become the villain controlling the Black Market in the future.\n‘But….’\nReflecting on past events.\nIn terms of helping each other, I thought positively of Se-ah.\nI also owed her a great debt.\nI lightly raised my hand, showing the back of it to Do-ha. It meant I would handle it.\nEven if things went wrong, I would take full responsibility.\nSe-ah smiled meaningfully and gave Do-ha a glance, then looked back at me.\n\"Senior, I can help you too.\" \"What?\"\nThat one sentence from Se-ah instantly grabbed my and the executives' attention.\n\"Let me lightly guess the situation first. It’s just my imagination, and it might be groundless.\"\nSe-ah rested her arms on the table and spoke. Then she raised her right hand and pointed her index finger upwards, starting her explanation.\n\"Vice Leader Baek Seo couldn't stand it anymore because of the constant involvement of Leader An Woo-jin with the six sinners. She left targeting someone. The first target would be the technomancer you recently fought. The problem is, she left without saying a word, and now the discipline committee is in the dark. Right?\"\n\"That is….\"\nAs Do-ha tried to respond.\n\"That's right.\"\n“Leader? Wait…!”\nI confirmed.\nDo-ha was surprised, and Se-ah smiled brightly.\n\"And the entity you caught by the window was a goblin, right?\" \"Did you know that too?\" \"Of course. It's the ability of the six sinners. Continuing my guess, Vice Leader Baek Seo must have had trouble with the six sinners. The goblin must have revealed Baek Seo's whereabouts. Is that correct?\"\nI nodded.\n\"But we know little too. We don't know why the goblin revealed Baek Seo's situation. It might be a trap.\" \"Where did it say?\" \"The technomancer's hideout in Ma Hyun High School's jurisdiction.\" \"How do you plan to find it?\" \"Technomancer's ability requires a lot of electromagnetic waves. So, there should be an abnormal amount of electromagnetic waves near the hideout. Or a place where there shouldn't be many electromagnetic waves but there are. I'm thinking of looking for such a place.\"\nSe-ah grinned.\n\"Sounds good. Senior, as I said before, I'm good at finding people. You can trust me.\"\n“Okay….”\nThud.\nSuddenly, Do-ha put his hand on my shoulder.\n\"Hey, leader.... Why did you reveal everything?\"\nHis tone was filled with annoyance.\nOf course, Se-ah was an outsider, not a discipline committee member. It was natural for Do-ha to express dissatisfaction.\nHowever, Se-ah had considerable useful capabilities.\nAs I mentioned before, she had been a great help to me.\nIf Se-ah had intended to harm me from the start, she wouldn't have made me feel indebted to her this much.\nThat's why I thought I could ask for her help this time.\nMoreover,\n“I trust Se-ah.”\nTo be honest, I just wanted to believe her.\nIt seemed the psychological barrier between Se-ah and me had broken down significantly.\nOf course, it wasn't absolute trust.\nI had no intention of lowering my guard towards Se-ah.\nShe was destined to become a major villain in the Black Market in the future.\nIf Se-ah ever committed inhumane acts, I was prepared to put a knife to her throat at any time.\n\"What…?\"\nDo-ha was startled by my firm response.\n“Oh….”\nSe-ah opened her mouth in admiration.\nIt wasn’t just for emotional reasons.\nI continued speaking.\n“And if Ma Hyun High School’s jurisdiction is the enemy's territory, it’s difficult to use only the discipline committee members. The discipline committee or the student council invading another jurisdiction is a clear violation of sovereignty. We’ll be immediately restrained, and security drones will easily catch us. If we involve Ma Hyun High School in finding Baek Seo, it’ll be complicated.”\n“So, you want to ask for help from non-discipline committee members to avoid detection?” “Right. We need to minimize the use of discipline committee members. Just take the core and leave the rest.”\nWhile we were talking, Min-hyuk interrupted.\n“What about cooperating with Ma Hyun High School...?” “Min-hyuk, think a little?” “What?”\nYe-song scolded Min-hyuk.\n“There’s an urgent situation where Baek Seo might be in danger, and if we ask Ma Hyun High School for help, do you think they’ll respond quickly? We don’t even have proof to request support. What can we say? ‘We heard from a sinner that our Baek Seo is in your territory. So, we want to rampage there.’ Is there anything else to say? If I were Ma Hyun High School, I’d be dumbfounded. It’s not like a child’s tantrum….”\n“That’s…”\n“Moreover, to request Ma Hyun High School’s cooperation, we need to get approval from the student council here and go through procedures…. It’s very leisurely, isn’t it?” “…….” “Even if things go well and Ma Hyun High School listens to us. They’re the ones we’ve been fighting over jurisdiction issues, remember? At the exchange meeting, we growled at each other showing our teeth. This time, they’ll be the absolute authority. Who knows what attitude they’ll take? We’ll be in agony, and the risk is too high.”\n…!\nUnbelievable….\n“Leader, Do-ha? Why are you so surprised?” “Ha Ye-song thought…?” “I do have a brain, Leader…. Please treat me like a human.”\nEven in a serious situation, it was astonishing.\n...Let's set that aside for now.\nMoon Chae-yeon's hideout would be filled with all sorts of weapons, including chimeras.\nIt would be dangerous to operate the discipline committee with minimal personnel, but with Se-ah's organization Dohwa Group or at least the Volunteer Club’s help, the situation would improve.\nI looked at Do-ha again. He was still seriously staring at me.\n“Anyway, I’ll take full responsibility. So don’t oppose it.” “…Tsk.”\nIn the end, Do-ha clicked his tongue and stepped back.\n“Does this mean you need my help?”\nSe-ah tilted her head and asked. She still had a sly smile on her face.\n“Yes. But, we might end up fighting a sinner.” “It’s okay. You’ll win, won’t you?”\n“…….”\nI didn’t deny it.\nI had to win anyway.\nBecause I couldn’t afford to lose.\n“Got it. Then tell me what you want.”\n“Pardon?”\nI put my hand on the table and looked at the edge.\nI decided to probe her.\n“You’re offering to help because you want something from me, right?”\nLike a businessman smelling money.\n“Oh…, do I have such a bad impression? I need to work harder.”\nSe-ah let out a small laugh.\n“Finding out that an acquaintance is in danger, how could a volunteer like me stay still? Also, I owe you a big debt. That’s essentially a life debt.” “If you’re talking about that subway incident at the beginning of the semester, forget it.”\nAlthough it was just a feeling, Se-ah seemed to want something from me.\nIf there was such a thing, it would be good for me.\nI could certainly get help.\nI also wanted to clear the debt with Se-ah properly in the future.\n“Anyway, if you want something later, tell me. I owe you a lot too. I’ll help if I can.” “Really, really~. So that’s what it was?”\nSe-ah nodded contentedly.\nHer eyes slightly opened, revealing her red pupils.\nIt was a meaningful look, as if she was trying to see through my intentions.\n“How heartwarming.”\nSe-ah returned to her squinted eyes and smiled slyly.\n“Then, shall we postpone the debt settlement for later?” “Okay.”\nSe-ah extended her hand.\n“Let’s do this, senior. Cooperation.” “…I’m counting on you.”\nI shook hands with Se-ah.\n......\nThe next day.\nWe finished our preparations.",

      "content": "Only a small number of members from the Dohwa Group joined us.\nSince it was an incident that could raise sensitive jurisdictional issues among major academies, we couldn't deeply involve the entire organization.\nSe-ah asked for my understanding on this, but I was rather grateful.\nI was relieved enough.\nMoreover, one of the strongest members in Aseong High School, the head of the Volunteer Club, had joined us. It seemed she had agreed to Se-ah's request.\nFirst, we equipped a Dohwa Group vehicle with radio wave detection equipment and formed a search team.\nThe discipline committee members Park Min-hyuk and Yoo Do-ha accompanied us.\nI repeatedly told them to stay in the vehicle as much as possible.\nIf the discipline committee members, especially executives, showed their faces in Ma Hyun High School's jurisdiction, there was a high risk of being caught by the security drones. It would definitely be reported to Ma Hyun High School, and things would go awry.\nThe search team headed towards Ma Hyun High School's jurisdiction.\nMeanwhile, the remaining members prepared for battle by equipping the discipline committee's gear on the Dohwa Group's vehicles and checking the equipment.\nCrack!\nI practiced my unique ability alone in the training ground.\n'It's going pretty well.'\nSetting coordinates had become much easier than before.\nAlthough it was still difficult to move to distant locations like Golden Sheep, I could almost accurately create a rift at the desired location if the distance was close enough.\nAt least, the mishap of trying to go to my shower but ending up in Baek Seo's shower wouldn't happen again.\n'Is it because I've been replaying battles in my mind?'\nIn my experience,\nI felt like the result was thanks to repeatedly replaying my battles with Moon Chae-yeon and mentally rehearsing the parts that needed improvement.\nNo wonder my space leaps had been going well while searching for Baek Seo.\nOf course, the accumulated practice so far had laid a solid foundation.\nBzzz.\nSuddenly, my smartphone vibrated.\nI clenched my fist and dissipated the rift, then answered the call.\n─ Senior, we found it.\nIt was Se-ah's voice.\n─ We detected a place with a lot of electromagnetic waves that didn't make sense. We also detected some unnatural heat. We wouldn't have noticed if we hadn't specifically been looking for it. \"Where is it?\" ─ Let's see.... It's on the outskirts. We didn't approach it as you ordered, so we don't know the exact origin.\nThe outskirts of Ma Hyun High School's jurisdiction were empty plains.\nThere was no way Moon Chae-yeon's hideout was blatantly there.\nIn other words,\n'Underground.'\nThe hideout seemed to be underground.\n─ By the way, you know that guy you had with his head in the toilet? Can't we extract information about the hideout from him?\nShe was referring to the man I dealt with the day I met Moon Chae-yeon.\n\"Where did you get that information? The investigation records should be confidential.\" ─ Ye-song told me. Was it sensitive information? “…That guy is a contractor. He doesn't know anything.\"\nIt was something I had already found out before.\nIf the guy with his head in the toilet had known anything important about Chae-yeon, she wouldn't have left him alone.\n─ I see.... That's unfortunate. I was a bit curious. \"Don't get any funny ideas.\" ─ Of course~. I'll withdraw for now! \"Okay.\"\nIf we approached the hideout, there was a risk of a fight breaking out.\nWe couldn't afford to let our eagerness ruin things.\nOf course, the place could be a trap set by the six sinners. Even so, we couldn't give up on going there.\nClick. I hung up the phone.\nWe shouldn't delay, but charging in recklessly was a foolish move.\nSo, thorough preparation was needed.\nChecking equipment and assembling forces, the operation would start this evening.\nIn the evening, as the sky turned red with the sunset,\n‘Everyone's gathered.’\nOnly the executives of the Aseong High School discipline committee, including myself, were to move.\nAs mentioned earlier, discipline committee members like us, who were well-known externally, could be easily spotted and identified in another academy's jurisdiction.\nHowever, just in case, we established a reserve grenade launcher unit.\nThe command role was assigned to Yoo Do-ha. In other words, Do-ha would remain here.\nAlso, it was obvious we couldn't take the discipline committee vehicles. They would definitely be detected by Ma Hyun High School in advance.\nSo, the discipline committee's combat gear was installed in the vehicles provided by the Dohwa Group.\nThe Dohwa Group members who joined the team were the drivers and a sniper named Lee Jung-mi.\nIn addition, the Volunteer Club joined. Se-ah's friends and the head of the Volunteer Club.\nThe most noticeable person was Lee Jung-mi.\nShe exuded the elegance of an elite and had a refined magical aura.\nHowever, she made it clear that she was only there to protect Se-ah. She wouldn't get involved in anything else.\nI was grateful for any kind of cooperation.\n“You seem deep in thought.”\nWhile everyone was checking their equipment or getting ready,\nA muscular female student, the head of the Volunteer Club, Kang Hee-yoon, approached me.\nShe stood next to me.\n“…Thank you for stepping up to help.” “Don't mention it. As the Volunteer Club, it's natural to help those in need. And... I owe a lot to Se-ah. I couldn't refuse her request.”\nI looked at Se-ah, who was talking with the Dohwa Group members while checking the equipment.\nSe-ah noticed my gaze and smiled brightly like a fox.\n“Again, it might be dangerous.” “I don't mind.”\nThe Volunteer Club head, Hee-yoon, spoke in a serious tone.\n“'We're saving Baek Seo.' That's our only task, right? How could we leave such a good person because of danger?” “…I'll repay this debt later.”\nHee-yoon scoffed.\n“No need. Don't you think I know you've always helped our Volunteer Club members and the needy? You're already an honorary member of the Volunteer Club. Helping each other is what members do. That's loyalty…!”\nHee-yoon gave a thumbs-up and winked.\nSparkle. Hee-yoon's eyes shone brightly for a moment.\n“Okay…, thank you.”\nWhen I extended my arm, Hee-yoon bumped her arm against mine.\nSoon, all preparations were complete.\nFour executives of the discipline committee.\nOne of them, Yoo Do-ha, stayed with the reserve grenade launcher unit.\nSo, it was me, Ha Ye-song, and Park Min-hyuk—three in total.\nFive members of the Dohwa Group, including Lee Se-ah, and four from the Volunteer Club.\nA total of twelve people formed the task force.\nThe task force members all looked at me simultaneously. They were waiting to hear from me before departing.\nSuddenly, I recalled the time when I searched for Kim Dal-bi alone in my childhood.\nUnlike then, now I had people to help find Baek Seo.\nIt felt reassuring.\nI took a deep breath and solemnly spoke.\n“Thank you for gathering. As I said before, I will take all responsibility for anything that happens.”\nToday, surely many troubles would arise.\nWe planned to engage in combat with a sinner in another academy's jurisdiction without following legal procedures.\nI hadn't reported to the student council.\nIt was all solely my decision.\nNo matter how hard we tried, it would only delay being hindered by Ma Hyun High School.\nGetting caught by the Aseong High School student council or Ma Hyun High School's discipline committee was just a matter of time.\nAfter today, a disciplinary committee would likely be convened.\nBut no matter what happened,\nI was determined to bring back Baek Seo.\nI cursed the fact that I was born again into this world.\nI hated this detestable place that had tormented me so much from the factory.\nEven if being born wasn't my choice,\nAt least I would change the future as I wished.\nAnd Baek Seo had to be there.\nI had already decided.\n“Get ready to raise hell.”\nI said, putting on my black gloves.\n“Let's go.”\nThe discipline committee executives responded with a firm “Yes!” and the Volunteer Club members laughed wickedly and cheerfully.\nSe-ah smiled like a fox, and the Dohwa Group members nodded.\nThe next discipline committee head. A genius without equal. The youngest to reach the 6th rank. A possessor of top-tier magical power.\nWhenever Baek Seo was praised for her abilities, she would only smile gently.\nBaek Seo's abilities were recognized everywhere, and everyone wanted to win her favor.\nCompliments that felt burdensome always followed Baek Seo.\nSince she was good-looking and kind-hearted, it was natural that she was highly regarded.\nHowever, to Baek Seo,\nAll of it was just detestable.\nOutstanding ability. Amazing. A genius. No one can catch up to Baek Seo. Heaven bestowed her with unparalleled blessings. She might even rival the great Goliath.\n‘...Annoying.’\nBaek Seo's gentle smile concealed a fierce disgust that churned in her stomach.\nAll her exceptional abilities were cultivated by the Principal's will.\nThe praise towards Baek Seo only revived memories of her cursed past.\nHaving endured the torturous training during the Golden Time, becoming the Principal's hunting dog and Spartoi, killing many human scumbags,\nThe wretched human that was cultivated was herself.\nThat’s why, whenever people praised her abilities, it made her nauseous.\nIn the end, unable to bear it, Baek Seo often vomited with her head in the toilet.\nIt wasn't about blaming those who praised her abilities.\nBaek Seo simply hated herself.\nShe found herself detestable.\n‘I will become the next discipline committee head.’\nThen, a man caught her eye.\nEveryone believed without a doubt that Baek Seo would become the next discipline committee head of Aseong High School.\nYet, An Woo-jin confidently proclaimed without hesitation that he would be the next discipline committee head, as if he didn't see Baek Seo as a competitor.\nBaek Seo felt a faint curiosity towards Woo-jin.\nSo, she talked to him.\nJust to find out if he knew who she was.\nHowever, Woo-jin naturally knew Baek Seo's stature.\nBut he didn't show any signs of being wary of her or trying to flatter her abilities.\nHe simply treated her as an equal and ordinary peer.\nBaek Seo passed it off without much thought, but she felt no disgust towards Woo-jin and started talking to him again.\nAs expected, Woo-jin continued to treat her as an ordinary peer.\nBaek Seo felt strangely comfortable.\nHer curiosity towards Woo-jin gradually grew stronger.\nOne day, while working with Woo-jin, Baek Seo brought up an honest question.\n‘Have you ever seen me as a competitor?’ ‘What?’ ‘Everyone thinks I’ll be the next discipline committee head. Don’t you have any sense of competition?’\nShe deliberately asked with subtle aggression and mockery.\nTo test Woo-jin's sincerity.\n‘What are you talking about.’\nWoo-jin answered indifferently.\n‘I just find you comfortable.’ ‘...What?’\nUnexpectedly, Baek Seo's eyes widened.\nShe immediately controlled her expression.\n‘That’s all.’\nAfter hearing that, Baek Seo stopped testing Woo-jin.\nShe simply stayed by Woo-jin’s side, feeling at ease.\nThen one day, as she was about to go to bed,\nBaek Seo felt a sudden stir in her chest.\nAt some point, Woo-jin had seeped into her heart.\nDrip.\n“…….”\nBaek Seo regained consciousness, tears of blood flowing.\nShe slowly opened her eyes, feeling the cold sensation of metal.\nIt seemed she had lost consciousness and wandered through her past.\n“You're awake?”\nA faint voice made Baek Seo look up.\nMoon Chae-yeon greeted Baek Seo.\nChae-yeon was checking a mechanical device, dressed in a tank top and shorts. She wiped her sweat while brushing up her brown hair.\n“Are you in a lot of pain? How many times have you fainted now? Well, extracting your unique ability is quite painful, right? It should be better now, though.”\nChae-yeon tapped her neck lightly with a monkey wrench as she approached Baek Seo.\nThe machine restraining Baek Seo displayed ‘95%’.\nThe device had patches of strange flesh and skin attached to it. It was hard to see it as purely a human creation.\n“Almost done. It’ll be over in two hours. As you know, when your unique ability is taken, you'll be dead. It's essentially euthanasia.”\nChae-yeon spread her legs and sat backward on a chair.\nBaek Seo's eyes were blurry. She barely held onto consciousness.\nThe lingering pain felt like blades stabbing into every corner of her skin. She didn’t even have the strength to make a sound.\nChae-yeon smirked at Baek Seo’s pathetic state.\n“So, why did you go against the Principal? No matter the reason, you received freedom from the Principal, didn’t you? You should have lived quietly instead of acting out. Tsk, how pathetic.” “…….” “…Before you die, let me ask you one thing. How did you get your freedom? The Principal wouldn’t have let you go easily. The Principal's side surpasses you in every aspect except raw power…. Ah, did you catch some kind of weakness and make a deal? Is that it?”\nBaek Seo's head remained down.\nChae-yeon sighed, then stood up and approached Baek Seo.\nSwish. Chae-yeon grabbed Baek Seo's chin and lifted her head.\nA strange indigo pattern, glowing with magical light, had crept up Baek Seo's neck. When the pattern covered her face, it would be the end for Baek Seo.\n“What should I call this? Awake yet mentally gone...?” “…….”\nChae-yeon's eyes darkened.\n“…Baek Seo. I think you were foolish. Surviving is the most important thing. If you throw away your life so easily…. We can’t find any hope.”\n“…….” “I'll survive. I won’t act foolishly like you. Even if I have to lick the Principal’s shoes like a dog, I'll survive. So in the afterlife, blame me if you want….”\nAt that moment,\nA loud alarm rang from Chae-yeon’s wristwatch.\n“……!”\nChae-yeon looked down at her wristwatch.\nThe slot in the watch was glowing red.\n“How…?”\nChae-yeon was surprised, then smiled with admiration.\n“Someone found me…. Your boyfriend is impressive.”\nChae-yeon chuckled bitterly and released Baek Seo’s chin.\nScreech. Click.\nParticles newly formed around Chae-yeon's body, densely clumping together to form mechanical armor.\n“Kim Dal-bi or you..., I think I understand a little why you both like the Aseong High School discipline committee head so much. Well, I won’t let you go alone.”\nChae-yeon turned her back on Baek Seo with a smiling face, then her expression hardened.\n“…That’s my minimal mercy.”\nShe spoke quietly and walked away.\nSwish.\nMechanical eye shields began to form around Chae-yeon's eyes. They were called protectors.\nAt the same time, she swiped her fingers across her lips, smearing lipstick.\nIt was time to face the Aseong High School discipline committee head.",

      "content": "\"Thunk…!\"\nAs a heavy impact landed on the cockpit, Chae-yeon let out a scream.\nHowever, the barrage of spatial strikes couldn't penetrate Chimera's outer shell. It only caused some damage.\nThis hardness was not only due to its inherent durability but also because Chae-yeon had equipped Chimera with a large lightning rod as soon as she noticed Woo-jin's intrusion.\nBut still.\n'The lightning rod…!'\nThe lightning rod drew the spatial strikes to itself as intended, but it was insufficient to handle the overwhelming high-voltage electrical energy.\nIn the end, it managed to channel only part of the massive strike to the grounding line, eventually exploding from overload. Fortunately for Chae-yeon, this reduced the damage she faced.\nThe residual electricity spread out, engulfing the mechanical soldiers. It was like shrimp caught in a whale fight.\nChimera was a weapon for the future.\nUsing Chimera to defeat Woo-jin was like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, and Chae-yeon had never considered modifying it for the head of the Student Council.\nMoreover, the magic composing Chimera was extremely heavy, requiring a substantial amount of magic to control.\nTherefore, forming an immediate insulator to cover Chimera against Woo-jin's intrusion was challenging both time-wise and in terms of magic consumption.\nResponding with a grounding design was the best option.\nHowever, this ultimately led to Chae-yeon's regret.\n'I said I'd never let my guard down again…!'\nIt was the first time experiencing Woo-jin's spatial strike.\nShe hadn't anticipated such a powerful attack and was unprepared, leading to the current situation.\nOnce again, she had let her guard down against Woo-jin.\nThe head of the Ah-seong High School Council was an opponent who couldn't be underestimated.\nBeep! Beep!\n\"!\"\nThe screen in front of her displayed a red warning, reporting Chimera's damage status. It was a system Chae-yeon had implemented.\nThanks to the lightning rod, Chimera endured the spatial strike, but its condition wasn't intact.\nEven formidable warriors couldn't leave a scratch on Chimera's body.\nChae-yeon sensed something was wrong.\nAnd then.\nThud!\nA sound of impact right in front of her.\nIt seemed like someone had landed.\nFeeling instinctive unease, Chae-yeon quickly switched perspectives. The screen in front of her showed the front view.\nIn front of Chimera's head, at a very close distance.\nA man stood, with one foot on Chimera's mouth and holding onto protruding mechanical parts, glaring menacingly at Chae-yeon in the cockpit.\nIt was Ahn Woo-jin, head of the Ah-seong High School Council.\n\"Long time no see.\"\n\"...Ahn Woo-jin.\"\nChae-yeon's voice came through Chimera's speakers.\nAll the surrounding mechanical soldiers were destroyed and scorched from the previous strike, emitting smoke.\nOnly Chimera remained.\nChae-yeon gauged her remaining strength and spoke.\n\"You... That wasn't your full power back then?\"\n'Back then' referred to their first meeting and battle.\nA hollow laugh escaped Chae-yeon's voice.\nThere was a tremble in that laugh. Her tone rose higher. It was absurd.\nShe had thought Woo-jin fought skillfully even then.\nNow she realized that even then, he hadn't shown his full strength. She had been too complacent.\n\"Think what you want.\"\nWoo-jin drew a baton from his belt.\n\"I'll execute immediate arrest and severe punishment for the offender.\"\nSnap!\nAs he swung the baton sideways, an iron rod sprung out from within.\nIt was a three-section staff made from the outer shell of an armored dragon, boasting the highest hardness.\nIt was the Iron Dragon Staff.\n\"I will subdue you.\"\n\"Hah, interesting...!\"\nChae-yeon laughed provocatively and harnessed her magic.\n'No matter how strong he is, he can't destroy Chimera.'\nTo destroy Chimera, one would need at least a 7th rank warrior, someone like Spartoi Seo Kang-jin or Goliath among the Six Sinners.\nJudging this, Chae-yeon regained her composure.\n\"Did you forget? The ones outside are still within my attack range. Are you going to let them die?\"\n\"No problem.\"\nWoo-jin's eyes were full of confidence.\n\"Do you think we wouldn't have prepared for that?\"\n\"...?\"\nPart of the screen in Chimera's cockpit still displayed the ground situation.\nThe serpent tails, temporarily disabled by the spatial strike, began to move again, gathering energy in their mouths.\nBut then.\nBoom!\n\"!\"\nCruise missiles flew in from somewhere and hit each serpent tail accurately.\nExplosions turned the serpent heads, scattering the energy gathered in their mouths.\nThe TV screens attached to the mechanical serpent bodies displayed grotesque, horrified expressions and screamed.\nThe grenade unit of the Ah-seong High School Council.\nThey had received preemptive orders from Woo-jin.\nTo bombard when the mechanical serpents emerged on the ground and prepared for a second attack.\n'Cruise missiles!? How...?'\nIt was unbelievable.\nThe timing was too perfect.\nAh-seong High School Council equipment couldn't be used in Ma Hyun High School's jurisdiction. The involvement of Ah-seong High School Council would have been easily detected by surveillance drones.\nTherefore, the bombardment must have come from a long distance, even invisible through regular telescopes.\nThe area was covered with Chae-yeon's unique ability like the sea.\nIt was impossible for the Ah-seong High School detachment on the ground to communicate with the grenade unit via voice or video to provide information.\nMoreover, Chimera wasn't visible from outside Ma Hyun High School's jurisdiction.\nHow could it be?\n'...Don't think about it. There must be someone in the Council with that capability.'\nIn reality, accountant Yoo Do-ha used her unique ability, Laplace's Demon, to execute Woo-jin's orders. Chae-yeon couldn't know the specifics.\nSo, she stopped thinking and focused on Woo-jin in front of her.\n\"Yeah, really impressive. You were prepared, huh? But why are you doing all this? It's going to be reeeaaally troublesome, isn't it? Are you doing this to find Oh Baek-seo?\"\n\"......\"\nWoo-jin didn't answer.\nAs expected.\nIf he didn't know Chae-yeon had custody of Oh Baek-seo, he wouldn't have taken such drastic actions.\n\"I could tell you weren't bringing the Council forces and coming here recklessly with just a few. I don't know how you found out I had Oh Baek-seo, but that's something to investigate later.\"\nChimera's beast-like face heated up.\nIt happened in an instant.\n\"Take her if you can.\"\nWhirr! Clank!\nChimera's head opened, and a large emitter protruded.\nSeveral main cannons and emitters also emerged, pointing in various directions around the head.\nWoo-jin narrowed his eyes.\n\"If you can!\"\nChimera.\nA monster mentioned in Homer's epics, the Classic of Mountains and Seas, and other mythological texts.\nKnown for its appearance, with a lion's head, a goat's body, and a serpent's tail.\nChimera is a vicious beast that brings disasters and breathes out fierce flames.\nWhoosh! Fwoosh!\nBlue flames poured towards Woo-jin.\nA function of Chimera modified by Chae-yeon.\nFlamethrower.\nThe flamethrower spewed ferocious flames and ultra-high-temperature magic projectiles like a waterfall from all directions. It was a massive attack.\nHowever, no matter how widespread the attack, it was difficult to surpass Woo-jin in terms of 'space.'\nCrack!\nUnique ability: Space Domination. Magic formula type 1: Space Leap.\nWoo-jin quickly caused a rift and leaped through space.\n\"As expected, you're freely traversing space, Council Head!\"\nChae-yeon laughed loudly.\nThe massive flames emitted by Chimera filled half of the vast underground facility.\nFlames over 1500 degrees Celsius engulfed the surroundings. Even structures made of steel began to melt in the fire.\n\"Do you think that ability will be much use here!? Huh!?\"\nChae-yeon shouted arrogantly.\nShe had anticipated that even if she unleashed such a large volume of flames, she wouldn't be able to hit Woo-jin.\nOnly a fool wouldn't expect Woo-jin to leap through space.\nIn other words, Chae-yeon's strategy was to turn the battlefield into hell.\nFwoosh!\nThe flames surrounded everything.\nNo matter how spacious the facility, it was still underground.\nWith such a large volume of flames being unleashed in a confined space, oxygen rapidly depleted.\nToxic gases expanded rapidly, and the surroundings, whether ground, walls, or ceiling, were heated to high temperatures.\nThe flame temperature reached the melting point of steel.\nEven if one wasn't directly touched by the flames, just being near them would cause third-degree burns all over the body.\nIt would also severely damage the respiratory system and eyes, and could disrupt the body's temperature regulation function, leading to death.\nTo minimize this damage, one would have to pour magic into strengthening the body, but enduring this extreme environment indefinitely was impossible.\nMoreover, Woo-jin somehow knew that Oh Baek-seo was here.\n'Even if his expression looks confident, I can see he's desperate to find Oh Baek-seo! No matter how he moves through space, he has to fight here. If he wants to defeat me quickly and take Oh Baek-seo...!'\nRunning away to the ground through space was not an option for Woo-jin.\nHe would fully anticipate that the longer it took, the more disadvantageous it would be for him.\nThat was Chae-yeon's strategy.\nIf the enemy could freely traverse space, then she would limit the space he could move to and turn it into a deadly environment, exploiting Woo-jin's urgency to find Oh Baek-seo.\nThough holding Oh Baek-seo hostage was also an option, Chae-yeon somehow didn't want to be that cowardly. She didn't even know why herself.\nFwoosh!\nThe underground facility was brightly lit by blue flames. Because of the flames, Chae-yeon couldn't see where Woo-jin was.\nNo counterattack came. Only the sound of flames roaring filled her ears.\n'Is he watching the situation for a moment? Planning a strategy? Hah, no matter what, it's useless...!'\nThen.\nCrack!\nSuddenly, a large rift appeared in the air.\nSome of the massive flames emitted by Chimera poured into the rift.\nImmediately, a rift opened behind Chimera, and the flames were expelled from it.\nWhoosh!!!\nThe flames released beyond the rift engulfed Chimera from behind.\nUnique ability: Space Domination. Magic formula type 3: Reverse Space.\nBut.\n\"Hah! It's useless even if you try that! Do you plan to roast me to death? This place has a cooling system that controls the temperature! Besides, to melt my Chimera, you'd need to reach at least the melting point of titanium...!\"\nChae-yeon shouted mockingly.\n\"Uh?\"\nFrom the flames pouring through the rift behind Chimera.\nWoo-jin emerged, cutting through the fire with his arms crossed to protect his face.\nChae-yeon's eyes widened.\nBefore Chimera's head could fully turn to face Woo-jin, who had leaped through the flames, he reached Chimera's head.\n'That crazy bastard...! Is he insane!? He could die jumping into these flames!'\nChae-yeon felt a chill.\nDespite the possibility of death, Woo-jin had jumped into Chimera's flames to deceive her.\nMeanwhile, Woo-jin had considered this in advance.\nChae-yeon's hideout was underground. The capabilities of Chimera seen in the original work. The fact that his spatial ability was known to Chae-yeon.\nConsidering all these factors, Woo-jin had anticipated that Chae-yeon would turn the battlefield into a deathtrap to counter his spatial abilities.\nAll it took was determination.\nThe Iron Dragon Staff cut through the flames and thrust forward.\nWoo-jin drew his magic.\nCrackle!\nTurquoise lightning surged fiercely along the iron-clad staff.\nLike a flash, like an arrow, Woo-jin dashed straight ahead.\nWith the other hand, Woo-jin held the Wallbreaker Staff, clashing it with the Iron Dragon Staff to unleash a lightning explosion. All this was controlled by Woo-jin as he followed the Iron Dragon Staff.\nHe had even drawn out the reserve lightning magic for this moment.\nIt was impossible to break Chimera's outer shell with his strength.\nBut Chae-yeon, to create a favorable battlefield, had opened Chimera's head and brought out the flamethrower.\nWoo-jin aimed for that opening.\nHe could destroy Chimera.\nThis was a rare opportunity that might not come again. Missing this chance meant losing the battle.\nSo absolutely.\nWoo-jin had no intention of letting this opportunity slip.\nAt Ah-seong High School, even when Woo-jin was in the 4th rank, he was regarded as a top-tier fighter.\nEven the 5th rank upper echelon fighters, like the head of the Ma Hyun High School Council, couldn't match Woo-jin in physical strength when both were enhanced by magic.\nThis incredibly strong man was now at the 6th rank.\nThere was no way Chae-yeon could anticipate the explosive power of Woo-jin's all-out strike.\nFinally, Woo-jin reached Chimera's head.\n\"Get out.\"\nWith a menacing tone, he muttered.\nGathering all his strength, he swung the Iron Dragon Staff.\nBoom!\nA fierce barrage struck.\nThe Iron Dragon Staff split the heated air and flames at an incomprehensible speed.\nRelentless shockwaves battered Chimera, and the fierce flames and powerful lightning magic collided, causing an overload.\nIn the end.\nBoom!\nA dense magic explosion occurred.\nEven Chimera couldn't withstand the impact of the blow to the opened part.\nChimera's body shattered and scattered in all directions. Chae-yeon was thrown from the cockpit and crashed into the wall, suffering severe injuries to her internal organs and bones from the explosion's impact.\nWoo-jin was also caught in the explosion, but he quickly escaped through space leap. However, he still took the full brunt of the explosion before escaping.\nThe aftermath of the explosion left a thick cloud of dust. Cracks formed on the floor, and Woo-jin emerged from one, rolling on the ground.\n\"Huff…!\"\nWoo-jin propped himself up, holding his ribs and gasping for breath.\nHis arms were scorched. The heat still lingered on his body, burning his skin and insides.\nFrom the brief clash, he could tell his body was in shambles.\n\"Hah…, hah….\"\nConscious of his labored breathing, Woo-jin raised his upper body. He stared intently at the dust cloud.\nChae-yeon was not yet down.\nSo he couldn't fall either.\nAt that moment, someone suddenly hugged Woo-jin.\n\"Are you alright?\"\nIt was Geum Yang, a girl in Ah-seong High School's uniform with long silver hair.\nWithout her timely arrival, Woo-jin wouldn't have been able to endure the excruciating pain of the unique ability's penalty. He was grateful for her appearance at that moment.\n\"Yes, I'm alright.\"\nWoo-jin steadied his breathing and answered, cradling Geum Yang's head.\n\"Let's win and go back.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nGeum Yang blinked and then disappeared into her labyrinth.\nWoo-jin slowly stood up. The dust was gradually settling.\nIn the hazy view, Chae-yeon's figure was becoming visible.\nChae-yeon's eyes were filled with determination as she struggled to her feet. Her protective goggles and mechanical armor were partially destroyed. She was panting, one hand on her face.\nHaving been directly caught in Woo-jin's full-powered strike in the Chimera's cockpit, her condition was a mess. A deep crater marked where she had collided with the wall.\n\"Hmph!\"\nChae-yeon suddenly laughed.\n\"Ah…, I'm really stupid….\"\nShe used her unique ability to form a mechanical spear in her right hand.\nThe same weapon she had used when she first fought Woo-jin.\n\"Why did I… live such a life….\"\nChae-yeon wobbled as she stood on her two feet, trying to maintain balance.\n\"This is just stupid…, dammit…. Haha….\"\nChae-yeon chuckled.\nIt was a self-deprecating laugh.\nShe was ridiculing herself, finding herself pathetic.\n\"Hey, Council Head.\"\nChae-yeon, her face covered in blood, glared at Woo-jin and pointed behind her.\n\"If you go past me, you'll find Oh Baek-seo. She'll die soon if you don't hurry. I'm extracting her unique ability, and it will kill her eventually.\"\nBlood filled her mouth and dripped as she spoke. With every word, blood trickled from her mouth.\nChae-yeon's pupils shook violently as she desperately clung to consciousness.\n\"Her unique ability…?\"\nWoo-jin was surprised by the unexpected revelation.\nChae-yeon waved her hand playfully.\n\"Surprised, aren't you? It's an outrageous claim, isn't it? Well, I'm too tired to explain…. And do you think I'll let you pass until I die?\"\nChae-yeon gripped the mechanical spear with both hands and barely managed to take a combat stance.\n\"So.\"\nChae-yeon smiled brightly.\n\"You'll have to kill me first, okay?\"\n\"…….\"\nWithout a word, Woo-jin tightened his grip on the Iron Dragon Staff.\nThe two locked eyes briefly, then gathered their remaining magic and charged at each other.",

      "content": "The Old Humans believed that knowledge and peace were crucial for the resurgence of humanity.\nThe biggest difference between humans and other animals is the effective use of knowledge.\nNo matter how evolved the New Humans are, it’s hard to change this despairing world without the advancement of knowledge.\nThe Old Humans ultimately judged that knowledge would lead humanity to a better stage.\nTherefore, on the blessed land given by the Golden Sheep, the Old Humans built a city for the New Humans, Neo Seoul.\nAs most of the Old Humans died, only the New Humans remained, turning the city into an academy city.\nThe Old Humans established infrastructure to ensure that citizens, namely children, could learn both basic living skills and combat in the city.\nThey laid down the foundation of the Republic of Korea, guaranteeing the basic rights of happiness and the pursuit of happiness as stated in Article 10 of the constitution.\nThey created a reason for the New Humans to fight to protect their home and revive humanity in the future.\nHowever, the core of the city was still the adults of the Old Humans, not the students.\nIn such a world, enjoying happiness was only possible when the adults allowed it.\nThis was the reality of Neo Seoul.\nThe children could only enjoy 'permitted happiness.'\nMoon Chae-yeon cursed her life.\nShe had endured a painful childhood due to the forced training methods imposed by the Headmaster and continued to live a life of exploitation.\nHowever, Chae-yeon thought there might be a reason for her life.\nShe might find out why she had lived if she kept living.\nIf she did her best to live, she might find a reason to live.\nMaybe, someday, she would smile, thinking it was worth living.\nBut when she looked back, there were puddles of blood at every step.\nNo matter how much she tried to enjoy dishes with cheese, liked mechanical engineering, or searched for the reason for her life.\nWhenever she looked back, something inside her whispered that she was unworthy of happiness.\nIn the end, she was just a criminal being used by the Headmaster. She had to stain her hands with blood and damage the city for the Headmaster’s unknown purposes.\nNo matter how hard she lived such a life, would it have any meaning?\nHer life, in essence, only caused harm to others.\nOn a day when deep skepticism overwhelmed her, Chae-yeon decided to give up on difficult thoughts.\nShe just decided to live.\nMost creatures live because they were born and do their best not to die. It’s instinct.\nDidn’t tunicates discard even their brains to survive? Everything is just destined to become trash eventually, so what’s the use of finding meaning in life?\nShe would not desire happiness or seek any meaning in her life.\nIf she happened to find an unavoidable meaning in life, it would be good; if not, so be it.\nFor now, she just decided to survive.\nIt was a simple reason.\nShe wasn’t ready to die.\nBoom!!\nThe underground facility was heated up.\nAhn Woo-jin and Moon Chae-yeon were engaged in a fierce battle.\nMighty lightning strikes and wind pressure spread out.\nThe Iron Dragon Staff and the mechanical spear crossed, tracing efficient paths to defeat the enemy. It was a graceful frenzy, a desperate struggle for survival.\nTornadoes rose, and lightning repeatedly struck everything down.\nAny ordinary person would have to be prepared for death just being nearby.\nThe two of them were at the 6th rank.\nThey were top-tier fighters even within the academy city, reaching the level beyond genius, known as monsters.\nEach of their strikes was truly threatening.\nWham!!\nFinally, Woo-jin’s Iron Dragon Staff reached Chae-yeon’s ribs.\nThe strong strike infused with lightning broke her bones, sending her rolling on the ground.\n‘More.’\nChae-yeon ignored the pain and got up, rushing towards Woo-jin again.\n‘More…?’\nThen suddenly, Chae-yeon questioned herself.\n‘Why am I charging at him now?’\nWhat was driving her to charge forward?\nFor some reason, Spartoi Son Ye-seo’s words about Kim Dal-bi being a 'high-quality product' filled her mind.\nMaybe she was just living a life like a mere object.\nThere was no reason for life.\nSeeking a reason was foolish.\nJust living was the purpose of life.\nIsn’t it the same for all living things?\nIsn’t instinct telling them to live?\nYet for some reason.\nEven as she charged at Woo-jin, she couldn’t recall a desire to win and survive.\nCrash!\nThe fight abruptly stopped, and Woo-jin’s Iron Dragon Staff pierced Chae-yeon again.\nTaking advantage of the opportunity, Woo-jin swiftly moved the Iron Dragon Staff to break Chae-yeon’s ulna and femur. The three-section staff was specialized for continuous attacks, leaving Chae-yeon’s limbs in shambles.\nCrackle! The lightning-wrapped Iron Dragon Staff struck Chae-yeon’s torso.\n“Ugh!!”\nIt was Woo-jin’s refined specialty.\nThe shockwave of the lightning magic sent Chae-yeon flying again.\nBoom!\nChae-yeon bounced off the ground like a skipping stone and crashed into the wall. Blood gushed from her mouth. She nearly lost consciousness.\nWoo-jin coldly looked at Chae-yeon, struggling as he approached. He was also exhausted.\nChae-yeon could no longer hold her mechanical spear.\nHer limbs were broken, and she had no strength left.\nHer magic was almost depleted.\nShe was at her limit.\nBut she did not give up.\nChae-yeon gathered the remaining magic to form a hoverboard.\nThe hoverboard lifted Chae-yeon’s body.\nVroom! Chae-yeon flew towards Woo-jin on the hoverboard.\nUnable to wield any more weapons, Chae-yeon created various automatic firearms on her body.\nHer remaining magic was barely enough to form magic bullets.\nShe saw Woo-jin, ready to swing the Iron Dragon Staff again.\nHe looked worn out.\nHe could have collapsed a long time ago.\nHis magic seemed nearly depleted.\nBut Woo-jin showed no sign of falling.\nHe stood firm like a general on the battlefield.\n‘Was there any meaning to this fight?’\nChae-yeon’s lips tried to curl into a smile. She thought of the Six Sinners and Oh Baek-seo as she looked at Woo-jin.\n‘Han Seo-jin, Oh Baek-seo, Kim Dal-bi, Hong Gyu…. How did you all hold on to something?’\nNecromancer Han Seo-jin was obsessed with the sea.\nHe silently followed the Headmaster’s orders, saying he wanted to see the sea someday.\nIn reality, the sea meant nothing to Seo-jin.\nHe needed a reason to live, and he just substituted it with the sea.\nSpartoi Oh Baek-seo and Goblin Kim Dal-bi were obsessed with love.\nTheir object of love was this man in front of her.\nLove blinded them and led to foolish actions.\nGlutton Hong Gyu was obsessed with the family he was coincidentally born into as a twin.\nHe was ready to jump into the flames of hell with his sister.\nChae-yeon realized, albeit belatedly, what they all had in common.\nThey needed a reason to live.\nThey needed something to drive them to continue this wretched life.\nIt was only natural that they clung to precious values that seeped into their lives.\nBut Chae-yeon had no reason to live.\nShe was just living because her instinct wanted her to. She used that as a reason and didn’t yearn to find the meaning of life.\nWhy was that?\n─ ‘You’ll have to kill me to pass?’\nChae-yeon understood why she said that to Woo-jin.\n‘I see. I wanted to die.’\nShe wanted someone to end her life.\nIf she lost a fierce fight and died, she couldn’t avoid it.\n‘That’s it.’\nShe finally realized the source of the constant unease in her core.\nHer mind cleared, and a genuine smile spread across her face.\nBoom!!\nChae-yeon’s firearms fired. Multiple beams targeted Woo-jin.\nBut when she blinked, Woo-jin was already close to her.\nIt was spatial leap.\nWoo-jin seized the opportunity and swung the Iron Dragon Staff.\nChae-yeon closed her eyes in satisfaction.\nCrackle! Boom!!\nWith the last bit of her magic, Woo-jin’s lightning-infused strike sent her flying again. She crashed into the wall and slid to the floor.\nChae-yeon no longer had the strength to scream.\nHer mechanical armor was completely destroyed, and her body was a wreck.\nSlowly….\nThe wrecked mechanical armor and the remnants of mechanical soldiers scattered throughout the underground facility began to dissipate with magic.\nIt meant that Chae-yeon’s magic was depleted.\nJust like a server crashing when there’s a problem, the foundation to maintain all the mechanical forces had collapsed, leading to their destruction.\n“…Hah.”\nChae-yeon let out a bitter laugh.\nIt was a hollow laugh.\nWoo-jin approached to put the restraints on her. But even he seemed at his limit, struggling to take a step.\nThud.\nIn the end, Woo-jin lost his balance and collapsed. But without any change in expression, he silently tried to stand and approach Chae-yeon again.\nIt was sheer tenacity.\n‘He’s really stubborn….’\nSuddenly, she was curious.\nWhat drives this man to go so far?\n“Hey….”\nChae-yeon called Woo-jin weakly.\nWoo-jin didn’t stop but glared at her.\nChae-yeon smiled gently.\n“Why do you fight so hard…?”\nBlood welled up in her mouth.\n\"Isn't it natural for the disciplinary committee to catch students committing crimes...?\"\n\"The disciplinary committee. Duty...? Responsibility...? Because of something ridiculous like that...? Or is it for something grand like pursuing justice, a vague and juvenile sense of mission...?\"\n\"A pathetic person who doesn't even plan to fulfill those grand ideals shouldn't demean them as vague and juvenile. But no, it's not for such lofty reasons.\"\nWoo-jin caught his breath and spoke.\n\"I just want to live well... If I work hard as a student, it won’t be bad when I become an adult, right?\"\n\"Wow...\"\nChae-yeon was genuinely impressed.\n\"So it's really for such a trivial reason...? You're more worldly than you look...?\"\n\"I'm no different. I'm a person too.\"\n\"I like that answer… It suits you.\"\nChae-yeon spoke casually, like chatting with a friend, as she looked at the ceiling.\nShe could feel her heartbeat slowing down.\n\"My heart, you know, I actually reinforced it with my ability…\"\nChae-yeon spoke weakly.\nWoo-jin stopped walking.\n\"My heart was weak since birth… It got worse as I got older…? I was supposed to die around twelve, but I somehow held on…\"\n\"……\"\n\"Now that my magic is depleted, I can't hold on anymore…\"\nWoo-jin narrowed his eyes.\n\"...You knew that forcing yourself to fight until your magic was exhausted would kill you.\"\nEven when defeat was certain, Chae-yeon had gathered her remaining magic to keep fighting.\nShe had willingly put herself on the brink of death.\nIn the original story, the Technomancer Moon Chae-yeon escapes somewhere after being defeated by the player.\nAfter that, her whereabouts are unknown.\nThat’s when the message appears that the Technomancer, one of the Six Sinners, has been defeated.\nAt the time, Woo-jin didn't think much of it.\nIt was just a game, after all.\nHe had just thought, 'I won.'\nNow he knew why.\n\"What now, can't catch me...? You lost, huh?\"\n\"……\"\n\"React a little, you boring guy.... Well…, someone as strong as you will live well and eat well in the future….\"\nEven the intense pain was fading.\n\"Live well, Council Head…\"\nChae-yeon slowly closed her eyes.\n\"I'm done with this…\"\nHer broken arm slid down her thigh, collapsing onto the floor.\nHer head drooped lifelessly, and her heartbeat stopped.\nThe pitch-black vision slowly turned white.\nChae-yeon felt her body getting lighter. She began to float like a balloon.\nLooking around, the scenery of the underground facility disappeared.\nThe world was beyond what Chae-yeon knew. When she looked up, she saw a creepy crimson sky beyond the white world.\nChae-yeon couldn't comprehend this phenomenon.\nThen, she heard a familiar voice from behind.\n[You’re not supposed to be here yet.]\nStartled, Chae-yeon quickly turned around.\nA mysterious girl in a black robe placed her hand on Chae-yeon’s shoulder.\nUnderneath the hood, an expressionless face devoid of any emotion was revealed.\nA familiar face.\nChae-yeon soon realized who the girl was.\n‘Han Seo-jin…?’\nHan Seo-jin, who had been enduring the penalty after losing to Ahn Woo-jin, was one of the Six Sinners.\nChae-yeon wanted to call her name, but no words came out.\n[Go back. Fortunately, someone can save you.]\nSeo-jin said as she channeled magic into Chae-yeon’s chest. Cold magic flowed into Chae-yeon’s heart.\n[And remember. You need to help the head of the disciplinary committee later.]\nChae-yeon didn’t understand what she meant.\nHad Seo-jin undergone a change of heart after suffering the penalty from losing to Woo-jin?\nOr perhaps... Seo-jin seemed to have learned something important.\nSoon after, Chae-yeon was forcibly pulled underground by an invisible force.\nSeo-jin spoke to the distant Chae-yeon.\n[See you then.]\nZap!\n\"……!\"\nWith a heavy impact on her heart, Chae-yeon’s eyes shot open.\nHer heart regained its original beat.\nThe severe injuries were temporarily treated with an emergency magical artifact.\nIn front of her were Woo-jin’s cold eyes. He was panting, seemingly exhausted.\nChae-yeon had returned to reality.\nShe was bound all over with restraints.\n\"You can't escape.\"\nWoo-jin’s lips curved slightly upward.\n\"You need to receive proper punishment and live your life suffering…. Then you die and fall into something like hell, right?\"\n\"How am I alive…?\"\nChae-yeon couldn’t understand why she was alive.\n\"There was some stored magic in the Wallbreaker Staff. I extracted it and gave an electric shock to your heart.\"\nWoo-jin was currently out of magic.\nBut he had reserved some magic in the Wallbreaker Staff to defeat Chimera.\nOriginally, the Wallbreaker Staff took time to unleash stored magic, but with the Iron Dragon Staff’s first enhancement, he could forcibly extract and use that magic.\n\"Since you were dying anyway, I thought I’d give it a try…, and it worked.\"\nHe sounded like he hadn’t expected it to work.\nDespite his words, Woo-jin had practiced resuscitation techniques to restart a stopped heart after reaching the 6th rank. Rescuing victims was also part of the disciplinary committee’s duties.\nSo he had applied a strong direct current to Chae-yeon’s heart, stopping it completely, then repeatedly applied electric shocks to match the pacemaker’s signals, making her heart beat again. It was the principle of a defibrillator.\n‘It felt oddly easy. The tactile feedback was peculiar. Well…, I’m glad it ended quickly.’\nWoo-jin found it puzzling but decided to move on.\nHe could only think that he had coincidentally managed to give the electric shock at the perfect timing for the pacemaker signal. It seemed he had been lucky.\nChae-yeon was still in shock.\nHer mind was in turmoil, not knowing what to say.\n\"...What are you staring at?\"\nWhack!\nSuddenly, Woo-jin struck Chae-yeon’s head. She fainted again after just waking up.\n\"Stay asleep.\"\nWoo-jin stood up, caught his breath, and moved his feet.\n‘I can’t use the communicator without magic….’\nHe had to move alone for now.\nCurrently, the detached team should be searching for the entrance to the underground facility as per their pre-assigned mission. They might have found it already.\nSo he decided to leave Chae-yeon to them.\nDragging his tired body, Woo-jin went to find Oh Baek-seo.",

      "content": "Staggering, he hurried his steps. He opened the door, entered the next room, and continued, catching his breath as he went. Eventually, he saw an unknown machine.\nThe display on the electronic board showed \"98%.\" Parts of the machine were composed of the flesh and skin of a living organism. The machine was confining a woman.\nThe woman's complexion was deathly pale. Strange patterns and veins surfaced on her skin.\nThe machine seemed to be draining her life force, and her once elegant appearance had deteriorated to that of someone at death's door.\nIt was Oh Baek-seo, the vice-head of the disciplinary committee.\nSomething sank in my chest.\nI thought I’d be happy when I found her, but instead, a suffocating emotion welled up inside me.\nMy eyes hardened, and my teeth ground together.\nThe miserable end of a child who had learned all kinds of killing techniques as a Spartoi was approaching.\nI guessed it would be a sight I would never forget.\nWhy did Baek-seo have to end up so miserable? I couldn’t understand, nor did I want to understand.\nSo I decided to reject it. The damn backside of this academy city that made Baek-seo like this.\n\"Baek-seo.\"\nWith the last of my strength, I raised the Iron Dragon Staff.\n\"Let's go back.\"\nI swung the Iron Dragon Staff down.\nAhn Woo-jin walked with the broken machine behind him, carrying the limp Baek-seo on his back.\nHis magic was depleted, and his stamina was at its limit. Every step was unsteady, but the compulsion not to let Baek-seo fall kept Woo-jin mustering the strength to steady himself and keep moving.\nHe walked along the path that was visible. It was a narrow path.\nAs he walked, Woo-jin realized the underground facility was quite decorated. Only the area where he had fought Chae-yeon had been a gloomy space.\nThinking even Chae-yeon had her own sense of aesthetics made Woo-jin chuckle unintentionally.\nAt some point, Baek-seo’s breathing became regular. Woo-jin noticed she had regained consciousness.\n“…Are you awake?”\nWoo-jin spoke first.\nBaek-seo's head moved slightly.\n\"Woo-jin…?\"\nIt was a small voice.\nBaek-seo seemed to not understand the situation of being carried on Woo-jin’s back.\nWoo-jin's condition was a mess. Baek-seo could only guess that he had come through a fierce battle to reach her.\nWoo-jin paused to choose his words.\n“Sorry I’m late.”\nBaek-seo swallowed a dry breath.\n“And don’t even think about submitting a resignation letter. I won’t accept it.”\n“…You saw it.”\n“I found it while looking for you.”\n“Yeah…, I figured.”\nWith Woo-jin’s response, Baek-seo fully understood the situation.\nHe must have gone through a hard journey. Just by looking at Woo-jin’s injuries, she could tell how much he had been through.\nThey were walking through an area decorated like a flower garden.\nBaek-seo closed her eyes and spoke.\n“Woo-jin…”\n“Yes.”\n“You once asked me where I learned my skills…?”\nBaek-seo spoke softly.\n“I’ve killed many people…?”\n“…….”\n“I was a Spartoi… My main task was assassination… I received training for that. Under the Headmaster's orders, I eliminated many criminals…. That’s how I lived…?”\nBaek-seo decided to be honest.\nWoo-jin mentioning the resignation letter was a roundabout way of saying he knew about Baek-seo’s plan to target the Headmaster. Hence, Baek-seo had nothing more to hide.\nMoreover, there were no surveillance drones from the Headmaster in the underground facility.\nSo Baek-seo could speak honestly about the Headmaster.\n“Even if I leave here, I don’t know what will happen…. I was trying to take down the Headmaster…. If you stay with me, you’ll get entangled too….”\n“Probably.”\n“So…”\nBaek-seo forced a gentle smile.\n“I’d like it if you didn’t get involved with someone like me….”\nAfter executing her plan to assassinate the Headmaster, Baek-seo had thought a lot.\nUltimately, she was a murderer with many lives on her hands. Moreover, she had targeted the Headmaster.\nBaek-seo believed that someone as dirty and dangerous as her shouldn’t be by Woo-jin’s side.\n“That seems… right….”\n“Are you an idiot?”\n“...What?”\nBaek-seo was taken aback by the calm yet unexpected question.\n“It’s better than always showing a perfect image. You seem more human now.”\nWoo-jin chuckled, his voice mixed with bloody phlegm. It was a hollow laugh.\n“Did I seem like someone who would care about that? You're treating me like someone with no loyalty.”\n“No, that’s not…”\n“Shut up.”\nSuddenly, Woo-jin’s expression hardened, and he commanded firmly. Baek-seo clammed up.\nWoo-jin was holding back a lot of emotions.\n“I have no intention of letting you go. It might be dramatic, but you need me too, right?”\nWoo-jin probed.\n“…Yes. I do.”\nBaek-seo buried her face in Woo-jin’s back. There was a faint sob in her voice.\nIt was a sincere word, devoid of any pretense.\n“Then why are you trying to convince me otherwise…?”\nWoo-jin caught his breath.\n“…I thought you were perfect. But a perfect person isn’t human. Ultimately, you also have shortcomings, and you’re handling something difficult alone right now.”\nThere was determination in Woo-jin’s eyes.\n“Then I can fill that gap for you. Just as you have filled my shortcomings up to now.”\n“…Will it be okay? If I stay with you…”\n“There’s no need to ask if it’s okay. Just…, I need you.”\nWoo-jin looked straight ahead.\n“Don’t ever abandon your duties and leave without a word again. When we get back, you’ll be reprimanded.”\n“…Yes.”\nBaek-seo’s voice trembled.\n“I will. I’m sorry…”\nAfter that, Baek-seo didn’t say anything more.\nShe just silently sobbed.\n……\nThe Ah-seong High School detachment found the entrance to the underground facility and came out to meet Woo-jin and Baek-seo. As soon as relief washed over him, Woo-jin collapsed from exhaustion.\nHowever, Woo-jin didn’t lose consciousness and instructed them to secure Moon Chae-yeon, who was restrained inside the underground facility.\nThe detachment began moving Woo-jin and Baek-seo. As she was carried on a stretcher, Baek-seo was more concerned about Woo-jin’s condition than her own. Her worried eyes never left Woo-jin.\n“Baek-seo…! I’m so glad you’re safe…! Ugh…! My forearm muscle…!”\nHa Ye-song, covered in dirt, cried out while calling for Baek-seo. However, she was writhing on the ground from severe muscle pain due to the penalty of her unique ability.\nBaek-seo felt a lump in her throat but managed to control her expression.\nThen.\n“……!”\nBaek-seo noticed a female student and showed a surprised expression.\nShe couldn’t manage her expression as well as usual. While part of it was due to her fluctuating emotions, the main reason was that she recognized who it was.\nThe female student had long black hair and half-closed eyes. It was Lee Se-ah.\n“Lee Se-ah…”\nBaek-seo’s eyes turned cold, but Se-ah responded with a sly smile.\n“Shh.”\nSe-ah quietly put her index finger to her lips.\nAs if to say not to mention anything about her.\nBaek-seo recalled how she had always been wary whenever Woo-jin and Se-ah interacted or seemed to interact.\nShe wasn’t wary of Se-ah as a rival in love. If that were the case, she would have growled at other female students as well.\nAlthough Baek-seo and Se-ah had never spoken a word to each other.\nBaek-seo was wary of Se-ah. And Se-ah was very aware of Baek-seo’s attitude.\n“Is the repair almost done?”\nSe-ah approached a member of the Dowa faction who was repairing the vehicle damaged in the battle and asked. She pretended not to know Baek-seo at all.\nBaek-seo also turned her head, pretending not to know Se-ah.\nSeeing the Dowa faction and Se-ah here, it seemed they had cooperated with Woo-jin.\nAlthough Baek-seo should be grateful for their help in rescuing her, it made her more wary of Se-ah.\nIt meant that Se-ah had integrated herself into Woo-jin’s life enough to be a valuable collaborator in such matters.\nThen.\n“Huh? This is bad?”\nSe-ah’s ominous remark made Park Min-hyuk panic.\n“Why, why? What’s happening!?”\nSe-ah scratched her cheek and smiled awkwardly.\n“They’re coming.”\n“What’s coming!? Don’t tell me it’s what I’m thinking…?”\n“It is. The Ma Hyun High School disciplinary committee.”\n“What, already!?”\nVroom!!\nThe sound of engines started getting louder.\nNumerous vehicles were approaching.\n“Hey…! Ma Hyun High School is coming!”\n“Those diligent bastards…! I thought we’d have time to escape…!”\nMin-hyuk and Ye-song muttered anxiously.\nAs expected, the Ma Hyun High School disciplinary committee was approaching.\nConsidering the time of the battle and the distance from Ma Hyun High School to here, the committee had arrived faster than expected. They had lost the time needed to quickly escape and come up with a plan to handle the situation.\nScreech!\nVehicles stopped simultaneously, and the Ma Hyun High School disciplinary committee members got out. They each carried weapons and lined up. The left arm bore the disciplinary committee armband.\nA committee member with a platoon leader badge stood at the front. He glared at the Ah-seong High School detachment with a cold gaze.\nA heavy tension filled the air.\nIt was easy to guess that things were about to get very complicated.",

      "content": "“Ahseong High Disciplinary Committee….”\nThere was no way that a disciplinary committee from a major academy wouldn't recognize the members of another major academy’s disciplinary committee, especially when it involved Ma Hyun High and Ahseong High.\nSo the platoon leader of the Ma Hyun High School disciplinary committee immediately recognized Ahn Woo-jin, Oh Baek-seo, Ha Ye-song, and Park Min-hyuk.\nFrom the surroundings, it was clear that a large-scale battle had taken place. It was certain that the Ahseong High disciplinary committee, along with several collaborators, had caused a major incident within Ma Hyun’s jurisdiction.\nWoo-jin and Baek-seo had been loaded into the vehicle by then. Woo-jin barely lifted his head to observe the situation.\n'We planned to leave right after securing Moon Chae-yeon. They arrived much earlier than expected...'\nSince Woo-jin, Baek-seo, and Ye-song were in terrible condition, the volunteer club was sent to secure Moon Chae-yeon's custody.\nInitially, Min-hyuk wanted to accompany them, but Woo-jin sent only the volunteer club.\nThey needed to leave as soon as possible.\nSending a non-combatant like Min-hyuk might delay the mission, and the task was simply to transport Moon Chae-yeon, so Woo-jin made that decision.\nUltimately, only the executives of the Ahseong High disciplinary committee and members of the Dowa faction faced the Ma Hyun High disciplinary committee.\nIf the volunteer club came out with Moon Chae-yeon, there was a high chance she would fall into Ma Hyun’s hands.\n'What should I do?'\nWoo-jin frowned.\nMoon Chae-yeon was a very valuable individual. She had information about the Headmaster.\nThey had to secure her.\nStep by step, the Ma Hyun platoon leader approached the detachment.\n“Go, Park Min-hyuk! I choose you!” “Huh? Me!?”\nFollowing Ye-song's shout, the relatively unscathed Min-hyuk stepped forward to face the platoon leader.\nAs mentioned, Min-hyuk wasn’t good at fighting, so he was particularly nervous in front of the platoon leader. The difference in their physiques was also significant.\n“You've engaged in a large-scale battle. And within our jurisdiction, no less.”\nThe platoon leader bluntly spoke.\n“It was… an unavoidable situation…”\nMin-hyuk stammered, glancing around for help. His eyes pleaded for assistance.\nBut no one could explain the circumstances concretely.\nIt was a clear illegal act to invade Ma Hyun’s jurisdiction and capture a villain without any report to the academy in charge, Ma Hyun High.\n“An unavoidable situation… We’ll hear about that during the investigation. Ahseong High disciplinary committee executives, and other collaborators. You are hereby detained for unauthorized combat activities within Ma Hyun’s jurisdiction.”\nThe Ahseong detachment displayed their wariness.\nAhseong and Ma Hyun did not have a good relationship.\nThe platoon leader’s attitude was also evidently hostile towards Ahseong.\nHis expression and tone were dripping with contempt, enough for everyone present to notice.\nClick, click. Ma Hyun disciplinary members began handcuffing the Ahseong detachment.\n‘No. If this happens, we can’t take Moon Chae-yeon...!’\nAs the worry became reality, Woo-jin bit his lower lip.\nIf the Ahseong detachment was detained, Moon Chae-yeon’s custody would go to Ma Hyun for the investigation. During that time, anything could happen to her, and Ahseong High's disciplinary committee would be at a disadvantage.\nThat was why they needed to escape quickly before Ma Hyun’s disciplinary committee arrived.\nIf they could secure Moon Chae-yeon’s custody, they could take time to plan the next steps despite the jurisdictional issues.\n“……”\nMeanwhile.\nLee Se-ah’s bodyguard, Lee Jung-mi, narrowed her eyes in dissatisfaction as the injured students were handcuffed.\nThen, Se-ah approached Jung-mi and whispered.\n“It seems senior Woo-jin wants to secure the technomancer’s custody. I’d like to do that too. If we get out of this situation, I think we can manage it…”\n“…Understood, Se-ah. I’ll try.”\nJung-mi answered Se-ah, who was smiling slyly, and stepped forward to the platoon leader.\n“You have the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney…” “I’m from the Hanyang Federal Academy’s Student Council Audit Department. Stop the detention immediately.” “What?”\nEveryone looked surprised as Jung-mi pulled out her student ID.\nUnder the Federation Council. The top academy in Neo Seoul, without a doubt. Hanyang Federal Academy.\nThe student council at the top of all academies was the General Student Council.\nGiven the appearance of such an elite member, everyone was taken aback.\n“Ha, Hanyang…!?”\nYe-song and Min-hyuk's jaws dropped at the unexpected revelation of Jung-mi’s identity.\nThe platoon leader was also surprised but quickly checked Jung-mi’s student ID and verified her identity.\n“Your identity is confirmed.”\nSince the opponent was a member of the General Student Council, the platoon leader addressed her respectfully.\n‘So she was from the General Student Council...’\nWoo-jin observed Jung-mi as if studying her.\nLater, a member of the General Student Council would disappear. That person seemed to be Lee Jung-mi from the Dowa faction. It was when the Dowa faction collapsed and Se-ah met a mysterious death.\n‘It’s reassuring to have the Audit Department, but I doubt that Ma Hyun's platoon leader will back down easily.’\nIt was not advantageous to be on the bad side of the General Student Council, especially the Audit Department.\nIf an academy got on the wrong side of the Audit Department, a retaliatory audit could destroy it. It was practically an object of fear.\nEven Ahseong’s Student Council President would be submissive in front of the Hanyang General Student Council. But this was all about understanding and balancing interests.\n“Why is a member of the Hanyang General Student Council here? We’ll discuss that later. Present your reasons if you want to oppose the detention.”\nThe platoon leader was adamant.\n‘A model student, indeed.’\nWoo-jin thought it was a proper attitude for a disciplinary committee.\nMaintaining rules and laws without being swayed by the opponent’s status or position was a basic virtue of the disciplinary committee.\n‘He won’t back down easily.’\nWoo-jin sighed slightly.\n“From the badge, I see you’re the platoon leader of Ma Hyun’s disciplinary committee. Shouldn’t you prioritize transporting the injured first? Rescue should come first, right?”\nJung-mi spoke aggressively while glaring at the platoon leader.\nIt was clear that the platoon leader had animosity towards Ahseong. Jung-mi guessed it was due to previous conflicts over jurisdiction before Woo-jin became the head of the disciplinary committee.\nSo Jung-mi deliberately showed displeasure on her face.\nHer strategy was to suppress the opponent by flaunting her affiliation with the Audit Department. It was petty, but there was no other choice in this situation.\n“Moreover, we have no intention to flee or destroy evidence. Our vehicles were damaged during the battle, and we plan to fully cooperate with the investigation. Additionally, we captured one of Neo Seoul’s biggest nuisances, a heinous criminal among the Six Sins. Illegal acts committed for the public good do not constitute a crime. There were no civilian casualties here, so our actions were not excessive compared to the public interest we protected. Detention is not a reasonable action. The battle is over, so calling us in flagrante delicto is misplaced, isn’t it?”\nIt wasn’t incorrect, but it was all a distraction.\nIn this situation, the power to arrest lay with Ma Hyun’s disciplinary committee, specifically the platoon leader standing before them.\nThe situation favored Ma Hyun, so Jung-mi planned to exploit any sign of fear in the platoon leader.\n“Exactly! We caught one of the Six Sins! Instead of thanking us, you’re... Ah, my muscles...!”\nYe-song agreed but then rolled on the ground in pain from her muscle cramps.\nJung-mi glanced at Ye-song, who was rambling without thinking, with a disdainful look and continued speaking as if nothing happened.\n“Even if there are other issues to discuss, the detention itself is unjustified. If you proceed with the arrest, we will formally protest. So let’s focus on resolving the situation first. We will fully cooperate with the investigation, so there’s no need to worry about that.”\nSe-ah had said that once they got out of this situation, they could somehow secure Moon Chae-yeon.\nJung-mi guessed what Se-ah was planning.\nIf they weren’t detained, they could transport Moon Chae-yeon to Ma Hyun for investigation and then use the remaining organization members to steal her away.\nIt might cause problems later, but Se-ah could slip away cunningly and have enough time to extract crucial information.\nBut.\n“Then prove it.”\nThe platoon leader responded monotonously.\n“…What?”\nJung-mi narrowed her eyes, crossing her arms and tilting her head in confusion.\n“It’s your responsibility to prove that there’s no risk of flight or evidence destruction, Ma Hyun’s disciplinary committee. Didn’t you know that?”\n“No, that’s not what I meant. Don’t pretend to be ignorant.”\nThe platoon leader shook his head and looked at Jung-mi with a fierce gaze.\n“You invaded our jurisdiction without any report to Ma Hyun High and disrupted order. Capturing a member of the Six Sins is commendable, but you ignored laws and procedures without any urgent threat, and you’re still in Ma Hyun’s jurisdiction. So prove that your actions are not illegal.”\n“We were protecting the public…”\n“Hasn’t your ‘Six Sins capture’ mission ended yet?”\nThe platoon leader pointed towards the entrance of the underground facility while keeping his eyes fixed on Jung-mi. Her gaze followed his.\nAt that moment, the volunteer club leader appeared, carrying the unconscious Moon Chae-yeon on his back, followed by other club members.\n“Look at this sinister woman getting what she deserves…!” “Justice served…! Wait, what’s going on…?”\nThe volunteer club was shocked by the scene.\nJung-mi sighed.\n“Discuss the public good and all that at the trial academy. Since the Ahseong disciplinary committee was involved in this incident, securing the technomancer is part of achieving your goal. In other words, we interrupted your ongoing illegal activity. The results of your public good argument aren’t in yet, are they?”\n“……”\n“Moreover, your goal might not be ‘public good through capturing the Six Sins’ but simply ‘securing the technomancer.’ There’s still a possibility of that. Clearly, we can’t justify arresting you as in flagrante delicto.”\nJung-mi clicked her tongue.\n‘He figured it out.’\nThe platoon leader seemed to have noticed that Woo-jin and Se-ah aimed to secure Moon Chae-yeon.\n‘It’s understandable. The Ahseong disciplinary committee moved discreetly and worked with other collaborators. He would know we handled this cautiously.’\nThe Ahseong detachment moved secretly mainly to rescue Baek-seo.\nHow did they find the hideout to rescue Baek-seo?\nThe basis was the goblin sent by Kim Dal-bi, one of the Six Sins.\nIt was a reason so absurd that it couldn’t be used as an official defense.\nThus, the situation was disadvantageous for Ahseong.\n‘This guy won’t be intimidated by threats either.’\nEven a hint of a retaliatory audit from the General Student Council’s Audit Department didn’t faze him.\nJung-mi disliked this type the most.\n‘We just need to get out of this situation…!’\nIf they could escape from Ma Hyun’s grasp, they could achieve their goal.\nJung-mi was anxious but didn’t show it. However, her silence was enough for the platoon leader to feel victorious.\n“If there’s nothing more to say, we’ll take custody of you and the technomancer. Detention will proceed.”\nThe platoon leader motioned to his subordinates, and the detention continued.\nMa Hyun’s disciplinary members took Moon Chae-yeon from the volunteer club leader.\n“And Ahseong’s disciplinary committee leader.”\nThe platoon leader addressed Woo-jin, lying in the back of the vehicle.\n“You’ll have to take responsibility for this incident. I’ll recommend disciplinary action to Ahseong’s student council and Hanyang Federal Academy. Having abused your authority and committed illegal acts, you should feel ashamed as the head of the disciplinary committee.” “……”\n“Consider yourself lucky if you’re merely dismissed.”\nWoo-jin’s abuse of authority in this incident was severe.\nDeploying the bombardment unit and other disciplinary members in another jurisdiction. Conducting disciplinary activities without reporting to Ma Hyun or even Ahseong’s student council.\nSuch a significant incident would likely result in Woo-jin being labeled as a ‘lawless disciplinary committee leader’ and removed from his position.\nBut Woo-jin didn’t react particularly.\nHe had already prepared for this.\n“…Hmph. Acting indifferent.”\nThe platoon leader grumbled quietly.\nHe had hoped to see Woo-jin’s disheartened face, but his expectations were dashed.\n“Huh?”\nAt that moment.\nBrrrr!\nAnother Ma Hyun disciplinary committee vehicle arrived, kicking up dust. The Ma Hyun members were startled and stopped what they were doing to salute the vehicle.\nA male student with brown hair and a female student got out. The male wore the disciplinary committee leader’s armband, and the female wore the deputy leader’s armband on her left arm.\nMa Hyun High School disciplinary committee leader, Lee Je-ho. Deputy leader, Shin Ga-yeon.\n“You’re here, sir!”\nThe platoon leader greeted Je-ho with a disciplined posture.\nJe-ho adjusted his glasses and surveyed the surroundings. He noticed the detained Ahseong detachment and the severely injured Woo-jin and Baek-seo.\n“Phew.”\nJe-ho sighed deeply and then.\nSmack!\n“Ouch!”\nHe kicked the platoon leader in the shin.\nThe platoon leader let out a scream, bending one knee. His face showed he was barely enduring the pain.\n“What were you doing until I got here?”\nJe-ho looked down at the platoon leader with a cold expression.\n“Uh, uh…”\n“Have you forgotten the primary duty of the disciplinary committee?”\n“No, sir, but…”\n“I command the disciplinary committee. Release the detainees and transport the severely injured to the hospital immediately! Have the healing sorcerers provide first aid!”\nThe disciplinary members responded with a loud “Yes!” and began unlocking the handcuffs.\nThe platoon leader was bewildered. Then Je-ho spoke.\n“The primary concern of the disciplinary committee should be casualties. And they captured one of the Six Sins, a significant public threat. They didn’t cause any major damage to the city. Their injuries are severe, so there’s no risk of flight. It would be highly contradictory for those who went to such lengths to capture a villain to destroy evidence. So, is prioritizing detention really the right call, platoon leader?” “But they…”\n“Let me guess. Were personal feelings involved?”\n“……”\nThe platoon leader’s reasoning was not wrong. It was legitimate.\nFrom there, various judgments could be drawn, and those judgments were his responsibility until a moment ago.\nHowever, the disciplinary committee is a hierarchical organization.\nRegardless of the platoon leader’s decisions, he couldn’t defy a legitimate and reasonable order from the disciplinary committee leader.\nThe platoon leader’s voice weakened.\n“…No, sir.”\n“Don’t let personal feelings cloud your judgment.”\n“Yes, sir…”\nJe-ho clicked his tongue and walked away.\n“……”\n“……”\nI was being transported to the hospital in an emergency transport vehicle.\nA healing sorcerer from Ma Hyun had provided first aid, so I remained conscious.\nAlso, since Ma Hyun’s disciplinary committee was escorting us, there wouldn’t be any dangerous incidents. I was reassured.\nBut there was one discomfort.\n“It’s a late question, but.”\nI looked at the person sitting next to me.\n“Why are you here?”\nMa Hyun High School disciplinary committee leader Lee Je-ho.\nFor some reason, he was sitting next to me.\nAfter providing first aid, Je-ho had sent the healing sorcerer to the passenger seat, leaving us alone.\n“I sent your deputy leader to Baek-seo. Why are you taking such care of us?”\nIt was unsettling.\n“Hmm, no need to thank me.”\nJe-ho adjusted his glasses dramatically.\n“I just thought it was the right thing to do…” “No, it’s unsettling.” “Hmm, if you must thank me… what?”\nJe-ho was taken aback, and a vein popped on his forehead. His hand, adjusting his glasses, trembled.\n“Ahseong disciplinary committee leader, you’re truly ungrateful…!” “Why did you help us?” “?” “We aren’t on good terms.”\nDidn’t we growl at each other while arm-wrestling at the first semester exchange?\nEven when we met at the campsite, we didn’t build any good memories. We were busy glaring at each other.\nSo it was puzzling.\nWhy did he reprimand his subordinate who was hostile to Ahseong and help us?\n“……”\nJe-ho looked out the window. The vehicle following us carried Oh Baek-seo.\n“It didn’t feel like someone else’s problem.”\n“Huh?”\nWhat was he talking about?\n“Seeing your pitiful state, I could tell something happened to your deputy leader, and you did your best to save her, didn’t you? You moved discreetly to avoid our interference.”\n“Yeah… no point in hiding it now.”\n“If Ga-yeon were in trouble in your jurisdiction, I’d have acted no differently. I’d have been just as desperate.”\nThinking about it...\nIn a way, we were the only ones who shared each other’s secrets.\nIt was funny, but it seemed to have created a sense of empathy.\n‘Ugh, that’s creepy…’\nJe-ho adjusted his glasses again.\n“You also managed to capture the technomancer. That’s undeniably a public benefit. I don’t know what punishment you’ll face, but we won’t raise jurisdiction issues.”\n“Isn’t invading another academy’s jurisdiction an absolute offense?”\nI knew that was the rule to maintain order in Academy City.\nSo, regardless of Ma Hyun’s stance, I would be punished.\n“At least it won’t go to trial.”\n“That’s significant.”\nThe sensitivity around jurisdiction was mainly due to the trials.\nThe academies are the parties in such lawsuits. It causes trouble for them. This is why Ahseong and Ma Hyun didn’t get along after numerous disputes over jurisdiction.\nIf it didn’t go to trial, the severity of the punishment might decrease. Ahseong might cover it up.\nConsidering my unprecedented achievements, they might find a way to mitigate the punishment.\n“I appreciate that. But…”\nI looked into Je-ho’s eyes.\n“That’s not the only reason, is it?”\nNo way he’d help just because he felt empathy.\nIn the original work, Lee Je-ho liked to flaunt his knowledge and, unlike the head-in-the-clouds president of Ma Hyun, was thoroughly calculative.\nHe wasn’t unscrupulous or selfish, but he certainly had something he wanted from me.\nJe-ho paused for a moment, folding his arms. Then, he looked at me seriously.\n“Who’s targeting you?”\nOf course.\nFrom the beginning, Je-ho was more focused on the essence of the situation than the immediate one.\n“I can’t say. There are reasons I can’t.”\n“I figured. It didn’t make sense for a member of the Six Sins to target Ahseong’s disciplinary committee deputy leader, especially not someone like Oh Baek-seo.”\n‘It’s natural to think that way.’\nA criminal targeting the deputy leader of a major academy’s disciplinary committee was highly irrational.\nEspecially someone as talented as Oh Baek-seo?\nEven a powerful member of the Six Sins targeting Baek-seo would create a lot of noise.\nUnless someone much stronger than Baek-seo, like Goliath, was involved, it would be hard to understand this situation.\nBut it was just Moon Chae-yeon, the technomancer.\nSo.\nJe-ho seemed to have guessed that there was someone stronger involved in this incident.\n‘If he thought that way, he’d also consider that major academy disciplinary committee members might not be safe.’\nHe might have thought that what happened to Baek-seo could happen to Ma Hyun’s deputy leader, Shin Ga-yeon.\n‘It wasn’t just empathy, then.’\nI finally understood what Je-ho meant.\nHe had envisioned a grim scenario.\n“Who are you fighting?”\nJe-ho asked sharply.\nRevealing the secret was risky. But there was no reason to hide it from him.\nI pointed upwards.\n“Heh.”\nJe-ho smirked and closed his eyes.\n“So, you were hogging all the fun alone.”\n“If it seems fun, I recommend changing your glasses first.”\n“This incident, while illegal, will be recognized as legitimate disciplinary committee activity. Post factum, there’s a provision that allows for retroactive approval of jurisdiction breaches for special circumstances. That authority lies with the disciplinary committee leader, which is me. That would make the technomancer’s custody legally Ahseong’s.”\n“…The price?”\nIt was clearly a give-and-take situation.\nJe-ho adjusted his glasses again and spoke.\n“When the time comes to catch those bastards up there, let me help. That’s my condition.”\n“……”\nI widened my eyes slightly at the unexpected answer.\nLee Je-ho. Nicknamed the Dark Strategist.\nHe was a valuable asset, given his prowess.\nIf he wanted to help, there was no reason to refuse.\nBut.\n“Why take the risk?”\n“Because that’s what a ‘disciplinary committee leader’ does.”\n“……”\nI understood his answer for some reason.\nBut the overly dramatic response left me unsure of how to react for a moment.\n“……”\n“……”\nA silence fell between us.\nThe atmosphere grew awkward, and Je-ho remained poised with his fingers on his glasses.\n“…Say something, Ahn Woo-jin.”\nHis words replayed our recent conversation in my mind.\nA shiver ran down my spine.\n“Ah, that’s unsettling…”\n“What are you saying!?”\nThe night was growing deeper.",

It's quite a dire situation.\"\n\"Ahseong, you say?\"\n\"Yes, it's the place where 'Ahn Woo-jin' is the disciplinary committee leader. The one you were wary of recently.\"\nYe-seo found herself having to add additional context each time. The principal's memory was continuously deteriorating.\n\"Let it go.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"There's no need. It would only escalate things.\"\n\"...So you're abandoning her?\"\n\"She had a heart condition anyway. You saw her magic deplete, didn't you? She won't last long.\"\nChae-yeon had reinforced her heart with her unique ability.\nWithout that, she would have died long ago.\nIn other words, since her magic was depleted in her fight with Woo-jin, her death was imminent.\n\"Indeed. No need to meddle.\"\n\"My child.\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"Who do you think is the most bothersome presence in my path?\"\n\"An easy question.\"\nYe-seo smiled sweetly.\n\"Lately, it's the Ahseong Disciplinary Committee Leader, Ahn Woo-jin. He holds a significant position and has impressive achievements, making him famous. His information-gathering abilities are incomprehensible. Plus, he's defeated Han Seo-jin and Moon Chae-yeon. Even though I thought he was strong for a 4th-tier, it seems his talent exploded as he advanced to 5th and 6th-tier.\"\nThe information that Woo-jin was a 6th-tier had already reached the principal and Ye-seo.\n\"The spatial ability, right?\"\n\"Yes, it’s clearly an extraordinary ability.\"\nThe match between Moon Chae-yeon and the Ahseong detachment was broadcasted by the principal’s drone.\nIt was confirmed that the Ahseong Disciplinary Committee Leader had spatial manipulation abilities.\n\"Because of him, extracting the weather control ability was also thwarted. He's not an opponent to be underestimated. A regular Spartoi can't defeat him, and even sending an A-rank Spartoi might result in failure or counterattack.\"\nYe-seo raised her index finger lightly.\n\"And it’s not just facing Ahn Woo-jin alone... The rescue of Baek-seo is a significant variable. Ahn Woo-jin will be even more determined to protect Baek-seo. Since Baek-seo has already been kidnapped once, their vigilance will be extremely high.\"\nYe-seo continued.\n\"And Baek-seo herself is formidable. Unless we bring someone like Kang Jin, handling her will be difficult. We don't need to go as far as 'Darts,' but we should maintain some level of caution.\"\n'Darts' referred to a stage where full force was mobilized to ensure a target's assassination.\nThe principal, after a deep breath, issued his order.\n\"Inform Hong Gyu and Hong Bin.\"\nHong Gyu and Hong Bin. They were known as the 'Gluttons' among the Six Sins.\n\"Have them capture the Ahseong Disciplinary Committee Leader with the highest level of magical ceremony. With their abilities, even Ahn Woo-jin won’t stand a chance. It will also make it easier to target Oh Baek-seo simultaneously.\"\n\"Quite a decisive measure, isn't it? You were saving that for capturing Goliath, weren't you? Isn't it a bit wasteful?\"\n\"Ahn Woo-jin's innate magic was not A+ grade. That’s why he wasn’t filtered out in the Zero District. But... his abilities surpass those I've nurtured... Cough!\"\nSuddenly, the principal covered his mouth, coughing up phlegm mixed with blood.\nHe looked at his bloodstained hand and continued.\n\"That child is... special. Now I am certain. This feeling has never been wrong before.\"\nYe-seo nodded.\n\"Yes, I'll prepare right away. It will take some time to get everything ready.\"\n\"By the way...\"\n\"Yes?\"\nThe principal's hand trembled.\nAs death approached, he couldn’t help but think of someone.\n\"I'm afraid 'that child' will hate me...\"\nIn the principal's smartphone address book was a contact labeled '1215.'\nHe had explicitly instructed not to touch Ahn Woo-jin, but the principal was targeting him regardless.\nYe-seo leaned in and whispered to the principal.\n\"You're prepared to be hated, aren't you? It's okay, Principal. Everything will be fine.\"\nLike a devout follower spreading the gospel, Ye-seo reassured the principal in a gentle voice.\n\"Shall we focus on extracting Ahn Woo-jin's abilities then?\"\n\"No.\"\nThe principal narrowed his eyes.\n\"I'm not just targeting Ahn Woo-jin.\"\n\"...Ah, you mentioned the plan before. We can target them simultaneously this time, right?\"\n\"You're always quick to catch on.\"\n\"Of course. Who do you think I am?\"\nYe-seo smiled contentedly.\nYou could call it the Technomancer Hunt.\nThe battle with Moon Chae-yeon had concluded, and I was hospitalized.\nAhseong covered all the costs. Capturing Moon Chae-yeon was recognized as an official activity of the Ahseong Disciplinary Committee, largely thanks to Ma Hyun Disciplinary Committee Leader Lee Je-ho’s help.\nAlthough there was still the issue of the illegality to consider, the exact consequences were yet to be determined.\n‘My magic still hasn’t returned.’\nBeing in a state of depleted magic, I couldn’t expect the same recovery speed as before, nor could I summon Geumyang.\nStill, I wasn’t lonely. I was assigned to the same room as Baek-seo. Just seeing her face warmed my heart.\nThis was a two-person room. Baek-seo was sound asleep in the bed next to mine. The strange markings on her skin were gone. She was fine.\nAccording to the examination results, Baek-seo's condition was improving normally. However, due to the excessive strain on her body, she would be in a deep sleep for some time.\n‘I can't move...’\nI wasn’t as deeply asleep as Baek-seo, but my condition was terrible. It was difficult to move, and I had to call a nurse for help even to go to the bathroom.\n‘I hope Moon Chae-yeon is being well-managed.’\nAside from Baek-seo and me, the other committee members had vowed to secure Moon Chae-yeon.\nUnlike Han Seo-jin, who was difficult to interrogate due to penalties, Moon Chae-yeon could provide valuable information about the incident. Therefore, nothing should happen to her.\nThe disciplinary committee had already begun investigating the incident. If any external pressure or issues arose with Moon Chae-yeon, I would be informed immediately.\n‘I don’t know how the principal will react.’\nI couldn’t help but worry.\n“……”\nI quickly made a call.\n─ What is it, leader? This is the seventh time today….\n\"Is Moon Chae-yeon safe?\"\nI asked seriously to Yoo Do-ha on the other end of the line.\nDo-ha sighed.\n─ That again.... She’s under the highest level of protection and still recovering. Her heart condition is serious, so she hasn’t woken up yet. Anyway, the doctor said to keep monitoring her. How many times do I have to repeat this…?\n\"Got it.\"\n─ Now, stop calling.\nI hung up and stared at the ceiling.\nThere was nothing more I could do at the moment.\nAfter a big battle, and not having rested properly lately….\n‘Maybe I should take this opportunity to rest.’\nI enjoyed the breeze and sunshine through the window, watching Baek-seo, or catching up on mobile games I had postponed.\nLate at night.\nI was deeply asleep.\nI sensed a familiar presence. Someone started stroking my hair. It was a gentle, affectionate touch.\nThanks to my heightened senses from reaching the 6th-tier, I quickly regained consciousness and felt the touch.\nBaek-seo? Did she wake up? No, this didn’t feel like Baek-seo’s touch.\nI grabbed the wrist quickly and opened my eyes.\n“Ah.”\nA short gasp was heard.\nWhen I saw who I was holding, my eyes widened.\nPink hair reflecting the moonlight. Kim Dal-bi’s startled face came into view.\n“…What are you doing?”\nI narrowed my eyes and asked.\n“S-Sorry.”\nDal-bi apologized in a flustered voice.\nI stared at her for a moment and then sat up. My body still ached, but after a few days, it was bearable.\n“Hey…?”\nDal-bi looked at her wrist, which I was holding, with a perplexed expression.\nDal-bi was in her goblin outfit, which she wore as a villain. The outfit had various functions.\nShe seemed to have come in that outfit for a stealth mission. Her mask was off, so her face was clearly visible.\nI glanced at Baek-seo. She was breathing quietly in her sleep. It didn’t seem like Dal-bi had done anything to her.\nIf any external factor affected a patient's vital signs, an alarm would go off. But the room was silent.\n“Are you going to call the disciplinary committee? They’re on standby at the hospital.”\nDal-bi asked after composing herself.\nBaek-seo and I were incapacitated. All we could rely on was the protection of Geumyang.\nEven if the disciplinary committee was called, defeating a 6th-tier fighter like Dal-bi without a plan would be tough. Would it be best to drive her away?\nTo capture Dal-bi, a detailed strategy involving the committee’s top fighters was necessary.\nHowever, Dal-bi didn’t seem to have come to fight.\nSo initiating a battle should be done cautiously.\n“No…”\nI closed my eyes and answered.\n“I won’t call them.”\n“Good decision. It would be pointless to increase casualties here. I didn’t come to fight either.”\n“Why are you here? It doesn’t seem like you came to cause trouble.”\n“Yeah… I just stopped by. Hehe, sorry for dropping in. Maybe I lost my mind for a bit. Do I look pathetic?”\nDal-bi wore an awkward smile, but her eyes lacked vitality.\nDark circles shadowed her eyes, and her complexion was terrible. Her hair was rough and unkempt, as if she had been up for days.\nWhat had happened to her recently?\nMore importantly, why had Dal-bi come here?\nShe must have known that I fought Moon Chae-yeon and that Moon Chae-yeon wasn’t here.\nShe couldn’t have come to the hospital to capture Moon Chae-yeon.\nEven if that was her goal, she wouldn’t have stroked my hair upon finding me.\nIt seemed like.\n‘Did she come to check on my condition?’\nAt this late hour.\nDid she wait until I was asleep?\n‘Because of old feelings? ...No, I’ll think about that later. And wasn’t she under the principal’s surveillance? How did she get here?’\nDal-bi visiting me implied that the principal’s control or surveillance had weakened.\n‘Come to think of it, wasn’t that the case before?’\nWhen Dal-bi contacted Baek-seo in the first semester to relay information about Han Seo-jin, she said the principal’s surveillance had temporarily lifted.\nI sighed quietly and looked back at Dal-bi.\n“No, you came at the right time. I have something to ask.”\nDal-bi tilted her head in confusion.\n“But let me say this first. If you came because of old feelings, don’t ever do it again after today.”\nI spoke without looking at Dal-bi, keeping my tone as cold as possible.\n“It’s disgusting.”\nHuman affection is truly cruel.\nI felt it before.\nSeeing Dal-bi’s face overlapped with the old one, my mind could only float in nostalgia for our childhood.\nNaturally, I felt drawn to Dal-bi.\nShe was the first person in this world to be on my side.\nBut no matter the reason, we had parted ways and stood on opposing sides. It wasn’t just a personal matter but one between the disciplinary leader and a member of the Six Sins.\nKnowing this, if Dal-bi continued to show ambiguous behavior, I had no choice but to act as I did now.\nA moment of silence passed.\n“Yes…”\nMaybe it was my resolute attitude.\nDal-bi’s smile faded. But she managed to keep her lips slightly curved.\nHer eyes and eyebrows drooped.\n“Yeah, it’s disgusting…”\nDal-bi laughed quietly.\nHer wrist, which I held, trembled slightly.",

      "content": "I watched Kim Dal-bi’s reaction closely.\nShe had never been good at hiding her feelings since childhood. No matter how hard she tried, her emotions always showed.\nAs I continued to observe her, I asked, \"Why did you tell me Baek-seo’s location?\"\nDal-bi lifted her head and asked in return, \"Why do you think?\"\n\"It was probably just a whim. I can't really explain it myself,\" she replied with an awkward smile.\nShe didn’t seem to want to explain further.\n“……”\nI didn’t know what her true intentions were.\nHowever, without Dal-bi’s help, I wasn’t sure if I could have even found Baek-seo’s body. It was clear that her assistance had been significant. So I decided not to press the issue any further.\n“...Thank you. Thanks to you, I found Baek-seo.”\n“Aren’t we supposed to be enemies? You shouldn’t be thanking me, my friend,” Dal-bi said with a troubled smile, scratching her cheek.\n“Gratitude is still gratitude.”\nI looked at her wrist, which I was holding.\n“And…”\nI almost mentioned the strange thing I had heard from Moon Chae-yeon.\n‘You can steal a unique ability...’\nI wasn’t sure if it was true, but thinking back to when I rescued Baek-seo, it didn’t seem like a lie.\nIt wasn’t information known to the world or even mentioned in the original game. If news about such a thing spread in Neo Seoul, the city would be turned upside down.\nRegardless, Dal-bi was on the principal’s side.\nMoreover, Dal-bi didn’t know that I was aware of the principal being her backer.\nSo asking her questions like ‘How can you steal a unique ability?’ was too risky.\n‘I better not mention it.’\nI decided.\n“And?”\n“!”\nDal-bi leaned in and looked into my eyes with a serious expression. She seemed suspicious of my reaction.\n“Nothing... Wait a moment.”\n“Hm?”\nAs I got a closer look at her face, my hand moved on its own, landing on her cheek.\nDal-bi flinched but didn’t resist. She seemed slightly tense.\nGently brushing her hair aside revealed a scar on her cheek.\n‘This is...’\nIt was a burn mark.\nIt had been left untreated for at least a day.\nThe color indicated that she hadn’t received proper healing.\n‘She has flame attributes. She shouldn’t get burned easily by most flames...’\nThis meant she had ‘allowed herself to be burned.’\n“Who did this?”\nI asked, looking straight into her eyes.\n“Hm? Ah... Hm?”\n“Tell me.”\nMy voice carried weight.\nNo matter how much I tried to dilute my memories of the past, sometimes those efforts were negated. This moment proved that, as my chest burned like a cauldron.\nPerhaps it was because I had learned the truth and the darker side of the academy city. Beyond the duty to capture Dal-bi, seeing her intentionally hurt pushed my mind to the brink.\nBut despite these conflicting emotions, I didn’t feel confused.\nWhen I met Dal-bi again in Shin Yongsan Street, I realized I still longed for her.\nYet I knew I had to remain firm since our relationship was already broken.\nAnd it was easy to deduce that this burn mark was caused by the principal.\nSeeing Dal-bi now reminded me of the other Six Sins I had fought. It made me want to uncover the principal’s methods.\nDal-bi, initially flustered, eventually smiled faintly. She closed her eyes and leaned her head towards my hand as if savoring the touch.\n“...I’m human too. I can get hurt.”\nHer voice attempted to carry a playful tone.\nBut it was a soft voice, like a small ripple in a serene lake bathed in moonlight.\n“You...”\nKim Dal-bi. Han Seo-jin. Moon Chae-yeon. And soon enough, Hong Gyu, Hong Bin.\nThe Six Sins aside from Goliath.\nWhat kind of treatment had you been enduring?\nIt was a meaningless question, so I couldn’t bring myself to ask. My words were stuck in my throat.\n“And it’s foolish for a member of the disciplinary committee to worry about an enemy. Isn’t that right, Woo-jin?”\nDal-bi gently pushed my hand away.\n“...It’s not worry. I just thought I should know.”\n“Really? So you want to find out how I got burned to help catch me later?”\nThere was no answer.\nDal-bi smiled as if she understood.\n“Today, as you said, I just came by because I was feeling nostalgic. You could call it a sort of reconnaissance between us.”\n“Make some sense.”\n“Hehe, sorry for waking you.”\nDal-bi apologized playfully.\n“I won’t come like this again.”\n“……”\n“Rest well, Woo-jin.”\nDal-bi vanished like a gentle flame.\nOnly silence remained in the hospital room.\nNeo Seoul was still ablaze with lights even in the middle of the night.\nKim Dal-bi sat on the edge of a rooftop, staring at the hospital where Ahn Woo-jin was admitted. Her cherry blossom-colored hair fluttered softly in the night breeze.\nAs a child, Dal-bi had placed a goblin’s contract mark on Woo-jin. It was invisible and had no significant effect. All it did was alert Dal-bi through sensations if the marked person was hurt.\nA few months ago, Dal-bi had visited Woo-jin when he caught the flu, thanks to the mark.\nRecently, Dal-bi had been subjected to ‘discipline’ in the Punishment Room. It was a consequence of defying the principal and was essentially torture.\nDuring that time, she had received reports from the mark indicating that Woo-jin had been severely injured.\nShe felt like she was going insane.\nDal-bi clung to her sanity through the torture, her mind focused on Woo-jin’s condition. She had heard from Spartoi Son Ye-seo that Woo-jin had fought a full-scale battle with Moon Chae-yeon.\nHer heart sank, and before she knew it, she had arrived at the hospital.\nThe principal’s surveillance had slackened just enough for her to visit, thanks to his rapidly deteriorating health.\nShe didn’t want to visit Woo-jin like this anymore. But Dal-bi couldn’t control her anxiety. Perhaps the torture had affected her sanity.\nShe had intended only to check on Woo-jin briefly while he slept. But he woke up.\nHis senses seemed to have sharpened with his elevation to the 6th-tier.\n“Thank goodness... thank goodness...”\nDal-bi sighed deeply in relief, hugging her knees. She had felt like her heart was breaking all the way to the hospital.\nIf Woo-jin had been critically injured beyond recovery, Dal-bi wouldn’t have been able to bear it.\n“……”\nThe night breeze caressed her skin.\nShe could still feel the lingering sensation of Woo-jin’s touch on her cheek.\nWhen she felt his hand, her heart swelled. She never thought she would feel such a thing again.\nFor someone with no place to return to or rely on, that touch felt like salvation.\n─ ‘Because it’s disgusting.’\nWoo-jin’s cold voice echoed in Dal-bi’s mind. She understood why he said that.\nIt was because she had deeply hurt Woo-jin in the past, and their relationship had become more than just a personal matter. It had become an issue between the disciplinary leader and a member of the Six Sins.\nDal-bi resolved not to visit Woo-jin impulsively anymore. Knowing he was safe, she didn’t want to linger.\nMoreover,\n‘Oh Baek-seo... I’m glad you’re alive too. You have to protect Woo-jin.’\nWoo-jin had Baek-seo. And he needed to continue to have her.\nEven without personal reasons, Baek-seo’s survival was better for Dal-bi’s plans.\nThat’s why Dal-bi had ordered the goblin to tell Woo-jin Baek-seo’s location.\n‘And…’\nDal-bi thought of the principal, who had broken his promise not to touch Woo-jin, while gazing at the brilliant city lights.\n“Principal...”\nHer dark eyes, in stark contrast to the beautiful cityscape, shone with determination. A resolute resolve was evident in her gaze.\nDal-bi’s plan was approaching.\nRecently, walking through the hospital park, my steps crunched on fallen leaves.\nIt was the end of the vacation. It was autumn.\nI had recovered enough to move around. Many people had visited Baek-seo and me during our hospital stay, so our room was filled with get-well-soon gifts.\nHowever, Baek-seo was still not awake.\nThe AI doctor provided a report. Baek-seo’s body was fully recovered and should have woken up by now.\nIt was probably a psychological issue or as if she was wandering in a deep dream, the AI doctor explained.\n“Bujaangniim!! The wild Ha Ye-song you’ve missed so much is hereaaang!”\n“Leader! This is Park Min-hyuk!”\nThe disciplinary committee members visited the hospital room after a long time.\nHa Ye-song and Park Min-hyuk greeted enthusiastically. Yoo Do-ha, on the other hand, greeted in a more subdued manner.\n“Welcome.”\n“Baek-seo is still asleep.”\nYe-song said as she approached me.\n“Yeah. Her body is completely healed, but she still hasn’t woken up.”\n“Leader, do you know the tale of Sleeping Beauty?”\n“I know it, why?”\n“Maybe a kiss will wake her up...?”\n“……”\nI held back from telling her to lie down.\nInstead, I flicked Ye-song’s forehead.\n“Ow! Ugh…”\nYe-song rubbed her forehead in pain.\n“What about Moon Chae-yeon?”\n“She still hasn’t regained consciousness. It seems like it’ll take a while for her to recover.”\n“No external pressure? Nothing today either?”\n“Nothing.”\nIt was the same question I asked Do-ha every day. By now, she answered automatically.\nMoon Chae-yeon, one of the Six Sins, hadn’t woken up since our battle.\nShe should have died, but thanks to my impromptu defibrillation, she managed to stay alive.\nThe hospital performed urgent heart surgery to keep her alive.\nBut her heart and blood vessels were irreversibly damaged.\nHeart transplant surgery was impossible, and she was expected to die within a month or two.\nThe only way was for Chae-yeon to reinforce her heart using her unique ability.\n“Well, let’s put the heavy stuff aside for now. First, the get-well-soon gifts.”\n“Ah.”\nYe-song flinched at Do-ha’s words.\nDo-ha handed me a gift.\n‘This looks pretty big.’\nThe large, meticulously decorated box was filled with all sorts of fresh fruits. It looked like it was prepared by ten people at once.\n“What’s this?”\n“A standard fruit set.”\n“It’s too much fruit to be standard...”\n“It’s just your feeling.”\n“It’s just my feeling, huh.”\nDo-ha turned out to be surprisingly considerate of her colleagues.\n“Anyway, thanks. I’ll enjoy it. I’ll have enough to eat until I’m discharged.”\n“But isn’t it too much for you alone? I could help you with it now…”\n“Calm down and put the fruit down.”\n“Oh.”\nYe-song, startled, hastily put down the apple she had picked up.\nThen Min-hyuk squeezed between Ye-song and Do-ha.\n“Leader, I brought a get-well-soon gift too.”\nMin-hyuk, who was grinning confidently, handed me a beautifully wrapped gift bag. It was a rectangular box.\n“What kind of gift looks like a Christmas present… huh?”\nOpening the bag revealed a transparent box with a figure inside.\nA figure of a man in a black uniform.\nThe moment I saw it, my heart sank.\nAn incredibly muscular body. A serious and stern expression. Pointing somewhere confidently with cold, green eyes. It was a high-quality figure.\nMin-hyuk proudly explained.\n“It’s the ‘Ah Seong High Disciplinary Leader Figure.’ They make figures of famous people. Since you’ve become famous, it was newly released! I got it as soon as I heard. How is it? Feel free to be impressed, haha!”\n“Oh my...”\n“Oh my...”\nYe-song and Do-ha seemed astonished.\nMin-hyuk’s smile froze. He alternated between looking at Ye-song and Do-ha.\n“Why are you two sighing...?”\n“Min-hyuk, man. This thing...!”\nYe-song pointed at the figure, about to say something.\nWords came out of my mouth spontaneously.\n“Park Min-hyuk.”\n“Yes?”\n“This...”\nI am...\n“I really like it.”\nWas I dignified?\n“Oh! Right, right!?”\nMin-hyuk’s eyes sparkled.\nFor some reason, Ye-song let out a shocked sound.\n“It’s excellent quality. Though it’s slightly different from reality, it accurately portrays my appearance as the disciplinary leader.”\n“Slightly different? It looks completely different! The muscles are over-exaggerated!”\nYe-song pointed at the figure, spouting nonsense.\n“The leader doesn’t look like this! This isn’t even cool! The leader isn’t this macho!”\n“Silence! Ha Ye-song, how have you seen the leader all this time!? The leader originally looks like this! Go to an eye doctor immediately!”\n“Your eyes are clouded! You go to the eye doctor!”\nYe-song and Min-hyuk started bickering, but I ignored them. My attention was solely on the impressive figure.\n‘All the effort to maintain my image was worth it.’\nThe more I looked at it, the more satisfying it was.\n“Huh?”\nDo-ha suddenly looked at something else and froze. It was towards Baek-seo.\n“?”\nFollowing Do-ha’s gaze, I turned my head, followed by Ye-song and Min-hyuk.\nWe all gasped simultaneously.\nOn the bed. A female student in a patient’s gown had risen. Her elegant face glowed in the sunlight.\nShe looked at us with a puzzled expression. After a moment of thought, as if trying to understand the situation, she gave us a familiar kind smile.\n“Uh... good morning?”\nIt was an awkward greeting.\nOh Baek-seo had woken up.\n“B-Baek-seo? Ah!”\nYe-song, taken aback, suddenly started running.\nWithout a word, I rushed to Baek-seo and held her tightly.\nMy throat was choked up. No words came out.\n“Baek-seo!”\nYe-song cried, hugging us both.\nDo-ha pressed the button by my bed to alert the nurse that Baek-seo had woken up.\n“I’m so glad you’re back...!!”\n“Ha Ye-song, wipe your nose.”\n“Is that important now, you otaku!?”\nYe-song wailed at Min-hyuk.\n“It’s a bit... overwhelming.”\nBaek-seo laughed in disbelief and hugged me back.\nMin-hyuk patted my shoulder.\n“Leader, aren’t you going to say it?”\n“What...?”\nMin-hyuk, moved, responded.\n“Okaeri..., tadai..., ugh!”\nThud! Ye-song hit Min-hyuk’s head.\n“Don’t ruin the moment, Park Min-hyuk!”\n“I have no money, and I still brought a gift, and you hit me...!”\n“Wahhh! Baek-seo!”\nYe-song cried and hugged Baek-seo tighter.\n“I must have... slept for a long time.”\n“Vice Leader.”\n“Yes, Leader?”\n“Don’t ever leave me again.”\nBaek-seo paused, then smiled softly.\n“...As you command.”\nShe answered.\n“Sniff, I! You know! I was so worried because you wouldn’t wake up...!”\n“Get-well-soon gift...”\n“Wahhh!!”\nYe-song wailed louder.",

      "content": "A cool breeze flowed in through the open window.\nThe clear autumn sky was dotted with fluffy white clouds, creating a perfect day to start the second semester.\nI adjusted the slightly crooked angle of my tie as I looked into the mirror, wearing my fall and spring school uniform.\n“This attire is quite enviable,” Geumyang said.\nShe lay on the bed, resting her chin on her hands, looking over at me while idly kicking her legs against the bed.\n“Do you want one too?” I asked.\n“Will you buy it for me!?” Geumyang sprang up, her upper body rising in excitement.\n“This week is busy with tasks left over from the break, so I can buy it for you over the weekend,” I replied.\n“Meh… very well,” Geumyang said, her expression melting into satisfaction.\n“Oh, by the way,” she added.\nGeumyang reached her hand into a small crack that appeared next to her, retrieving a letter from my desk. It was something I had recently received in the mail.\nShe shook the letter gently.\n“What about this disciplinary issue?”\nThe letter was regarding the disciplinary committee meeting.\n“I’ll have to face it head-on.”\n“What if it doesn’t go well? The abuse of authority you committed this time is severe.”\n“It won’t come to that.”\nI created another crack, this time beside me, and snatched the letter from Geumyang, shaking it as she had.\n“I’ll continue my duties as the disciplinary leader.”\nI glanced at the figure of the disciplinary leader of Ahseong High displayed on the shelf. It was posed with a stern expression, pointing somewhere as if confronting a criminal.\nI had to maintain that dignified image at least until my objectives were achieved.\n“…But why are you shaking your leg?” Geumyang asked.\nOh.\n“It’s gotten a bit cold. I’ll turn on the boiler as soon as I get home,” I replied.\n“Hm…”\nHonestly.\n‘I’m nervous…!’\nI was sure I wouldn’t be removed as the disciplinary leader, but if I received a suspension of more than a month?\nIf I ended up showing an unworthy side of myself during that time?\nIf the students and the disciplinary committee perceived my actions as severe abuse of authority?\nA pathetic future of me constantly watching my back was forming in my mind.\nIt was very unappealing. Just like Ha Ye-song…!\n“It doesn’t seem particularly cold.”\nGeumyang sighed softly and sat cross-legged, straightening her back and holding her slim ankles.\n“Do you realize this?”\n“What?”\nGeumyang pointed at me with her index finger.\n“You’ve gotten considerably stronger. It seems you’ve properly absorbed the effects of your training and practical experience.”\n“…Why the sudden praise?”\n“Try using spatial leap to go to school today, just like last semester. You’ll feel what I mean.”\nA little while later.\nAfter informing Oh Baek-seo that I couldn’t go to school with her, I started using spatial leap to get to school.\n“Huh?”\nIn just three jumps, I arrived at Ahseong High exactly where I wanted to be.\n‘Was it always this easy to set coordinates?’\nHow could something that was so difficult become so effortless?\n‘And isn’t my mana circulating faster since I recovered?’\nThis wasn’t just ‘growth.’ It had to be described with the adverb ‘dramatically.’\n“……”\nI remembered the time I fought Han Seo-jin.\nAs soon as I ascended to the 5th-tier and awakened my unique ability, I reached the realm of the 6th-tier. It was as if a blocked artery had been cleared.\nWas that growth still effective?\n‘It’s still not enough.’\nIt was fortunate, but with this level of skill, it was still difficult to survive safely against the principal.\nI took a deep breath, calmed my emotions, and headed for the school gate of Ahseong High School.\nMy feelings settled.\n“Disciplinary committee, the second semester has begun! We’ve switched to fall uniforms, and I’ve become even prettier!”\n“Every time you open your mouth, it’s a lie.”\n“Park Min-hyuk, shut it.”\nIn the disciplinary committee’s office.\nHa Ye-song was bustling around, spouting all sorts of stories.\n“We need to start the second semester in a good mood! Otherwise, we won’t be able to overcome the sorrow of the end of the break! Right, Do-ha!?”\n“……”\nYe-song sought agreement.\nYoo Do-ha was lying on the sofa with a book covering her face, fast asleep.\nYe-song walked to the back of the sofa, grabbed the backrest, and glared at Do-ha. She then yelled.\n“Hey, is this a sleeping room!?”\n“Shut up.”\nDo-ha’s voice came muffled through the book.\n“I know you’re worried about the leader, but calm down a bit.”\n“Hmm…, that’s…”\nYe-song’s true feelings were exposed, causing her to let out a blank sound before her eyes gradually filled with tears.\n“Do-ha…”\n“Oh, please.”\n“Will the leader be alright!? He will, right!?”\n“Leave me alone….”\nYe-song shook Do-ha furiously, demanding reassurance.\nCurrently, Ahn Woo-jin was being reviewed by the disciplinary committee.\nThe matter had already been announced on the school’s website and application during the break, and the committee convened as soon as the break ended.\nThe disciplinary committee members testified as witnesses, clarifying the facts. They did not perjure themselves, and since the facts were clear, the committee proceedings wouldn’t be prolonged.\n“Our school kids are so heartless! The leader is being reviewed, and no one has submitted a single petition! This is just too much, Do-ha!”\nYe-song continued to shake Do-ha relentlessly.\nThe book covering Do-ha’s face slid off and fell to the floor, revealing her annoyed expression.\n“We are the disciplinary committee. If we have earned resentment from the students, they won’t support us. What do you expect?”\nMoreover, the disciplinary committee itself couldn’t submit a petition. It would look like they were just protecting their own.\n“But… what if the leader can no longer be the leader?”\n“He seemed prepared for it.”\n“You’re so cold! Lacking empathy! An icy person!”\n“What are you even saying…?”\nDo-ha grumbled.\n“Min-hyuk, what about the leader…?”\n“Hic… Leader….”\n“?”\nMin-hyuk was already in tears.\nImagining Woo-jin being removed as the leader had made him sad.\nYe-song narrowed her eyes.\n“Why are you crying? It’s pathetic.”\nHer tears vanished. A mirror cure.\nAt that moment, Oh Baek-seo came out of the break room.\n“Don’t worry. It’ll be alright.”\n“Baek-seo? Oh, thank you.”\nBaek-seo handed each member a cup of coffee from the tray she was carrying.\nDo-ha, noticing the number of cups on the tray, reluctantly got up to take her coffee.\nAs a fellow woman, Do-ha tended to feel a bit intimidated by Baek-seo. So whenever Baek-seo showed concern for her, Do-ha accepted her kindness without complaint.\n“Aren’t you worried, Baek-seo?”\n“The most important thing in this committee is how Mahyeon High responds. After all, we carried out disciplinary activities in their jurisdiction without their knowledge.”\nBaek-seo sat on the sofa as Do-ha quickly folded her legs, making space for her. She sipped her coffee.\n“But for some reason, Mahyeon High acknowledged that we had valid reasons for entering their jurisdiction. The committee will likely take that into account.”\n“Huh? Why would they? Don’t they dislike us?”\nYe-song tried to sit next to Baek-seo, but Do-ha didn’t move her legs. Ye-song frowned and pushed Do-ha’s legs aside to sit down.\n“I’m not sure. Maybe they appreciated us catching a dangerous criminal in their territory.”\n“That doesn’t make sense. The achievement would be ours. Why would they accept that? Suspicious… Ah!”\nYe-song, stroking her chin, spoke seriously.\n“They might be trying to make us owe them a favor! That way, we’ll have to help them out in the future. Clever!”\n“Who knows?”\n“Shouldn’t the committee be suspicious of some kind of deal? If I were on the committee, I’d find it suspicious.”\n“We’re the offenders who invaded their jurisdiction. If there was a deal, it would have to be documented.”\n“True…”\nBaek-seo smiled warmly, sipping her coffee.\n“So no matter what the committee decides, the leader won’t be removed?”\nMin-hyuk asked, and Baek-seo nodded.\n“Yes, that’s likely.”\n“That’s a relief…”\nMin-hyuk and Ye-song sighed in relief.\nMeanwhile, Do-ha stared at the book that had fallen due to Ye-song. Her eyes reflected deep thoughts.\n“What’s on your mind, Do-ha?”\n“…Vice Leader. Are you hiding something?”\nDo-ha asked, looking seriously at Baek-seo.\nBaek-seo responded with her usual gentle smile.\n“What do you mean?”\n“……”\nA deceptive smile. Baek-seo always hid her true feelings behind that smile.\nA human’s ominous premonition often turns out to be correct.\nA person’s mind subconsciously combines various factors and sounds an alarm based on accumulated data.\nDo-ha could sense the reason for her ominous premonition.\n“After seeing Moon Chae-yeon’s abilities, it didn’t make sense that you were captured so easily. You’re the strongest here. You should have inflicted significant damage at least.”\n“Aren’t you overestimating me?”\n“And one of the lackeys of the Six Sins revealed your location. It means this involved the Six Sins.”\nThe atmosphere grew tense, causing Min-hyuk and Ye-song to fall silent.\nDo-ha stepped off the sofa and picked up the fallen book, brushing off the dust.\n“You went alone because you needed to handle it discreetly. And if the Six Sins were involved, strong enough to capture you…”\nThe terms Federal Council, Spartoi, and Principal flashed through Do-ha’s mind, but she couldn’t continue.\n“Dear.”\n“!”\nBaek-seo looked Do-ha in the eyes.\nA chilling pressure enveloped Do-ha, as if a giant whispered for her to stay silent.\nDo-ha instinctively shivered. It was a reflexive reaction when facing a predator.\nYet, Baek-seo only wore a gentle smile.\nYe-song and Min-hyuk watched them nervously, still respecting Baek-seo’s recovery period and hesitant to ask questions.\nIn her anxiety for Woo-jin, Do-ha had begun to hypothesize Baek-seo’s backstory.\nDo-ha would eventually figure out the truth, and Baek-seo was silently warning her not to speak.\n“Do-ha, calm down…!”\nYe-song whispered urgently to Do-ha.\n“…Fine.”\nUnderstanding Baek-seo’s unspoken message, Do-ha sighed and sat back on the sofa.\n“We’ll talk later.”\n“Sure, I’ll explain it later. Just be patient.”\nBaek-seo smiled brightly.\nShe turned her attention away from Do-ha and continued sipping her coffee.\nAt that moment, the phone rang. Min-hyuk looked around at the other members before answering.\n“Yes. …What? Who’s here? Hold on! Who gave them permission…!?”\nMin-hyuk’s surprise made Ye-song and Do-ha look at him curiously.\nMeanwhile, Baek-seo remained calm, leisurely sipping her coffee. She already knew what was happening.\n─ ‘Just…, I need you.’\nBaek-seo recalled Woo-jin’s words.\nWoo-jin knew the principal was an enemy, yet he chose to stay with Baek-seo.\nSo, the path Baek-seo had to take was clear.\nShe would fight alongside Woo-jin.\n“We will now announce the decision.”\nThe disciplinary committee chairman held the gavel.\n“We hereby remove Ahn Woo-jin from the position of disciplinary leader.”",

      "content": "\"Disciplinary Leader, Ahn Woo-jin,\" the chairman of the disciplinary committee announced in a serious tone, his eyes fixed on the documents before him.\nThe disciplinary committee session was held in the presence of students from various major academies. This practice was implemented to prevent biased decisions, as the position of a disciplinary leader in a major academy like Ahseong High was a critical role.\nHanyang Federal Academy took charge of such proceedings, with the chairman of the disciplinary committee belonging to Hanyang Federal Academy, while the rest of the committee members came from other major academies. Only two members were from Ahseong High.\nAfter deliberation, the majority decided on the level of disciplinary action. One of the Ahseong High members bit his lip and looked down, while the other glared angrily at the chairman.\nMeanwhile, I kept my emotions cold and composed.\n\"After thorough deliberation by majority vote, despite considering extenuating circumstances, it has been concluded that the student in question excessively abused his position as a disciplinary leader in a different jurisdiction. This caused significant disruption to the order of Neo Seoul. The nature of his actions is deemed highly improper. School rules and laws must be applied equally to all.\"\nThe chairman of the disciplinary committee raised his gavel and declared, \"Therefore, we hereby decide to remove Ahn Woo-jin from his position as disciplinary leader.\"\n\"I object,\" I said firmly.\n\"Objection? This is unacceptable,\" the chairman replied without lifting his gaze from the documents.\n\"Then please delay the decision,\" I requested.\n\"According to the regulations, unless there is an unavoidable reason, the decision cannot be postponed.\"\n\"It is because I cannot accept this decision.\"\n\"This is unacceptable.\"\nThe chairman answered dismissively, still not looking up from the documents. In the disciplinary committee, the chairman wielded overwhelming authority.\nEven if I could come up with an unavoidable reason, it was clear he would refuse to accept it with any pretext.\n\"Chairman, look at me,\" I demanded.\n\"…….\"\n\"Why can't you meet my eyes?\"\n\"Because there is no need,\" he sighed, sounding exasperated.\nThe proceedings of the disciplinary committee were excessively biased. The Ahseong High members glared at the chairman, discontent evident on their faces due to the unreasonable deliberations.\nThe underlying situation was easy to guess.\n'They've been bought off.'\nOnce the disciplinary committee members were selected, their identities were kept confidential until the day of the proceedings to ensure fairness and prevent lobbying.\nMembers from Ahseong High were randomly chosen on the day the disciplinary committee convened, eliminating the need to worry about lobbying. However, the external members had to be predetermined due to the structure.\nIt was evident these external members had been bought off, despite coming from various major academies.\nThe student council president could know in advance who would be selected for the disciplinary committee from their academy, as it was mandatory for Hanyang Federal Academy to notify them.\nThe student council president was bound by confidentiality, but if suspicious circumstances arose concerning the committee members, they could instruct the disciplinary leader to investigate those students. This was another regulation to ensure the fairness of the disciplinary committee, though it was practically ineffective due to strong security and the difficulty of detecting illegal interventions beforehand.\nDespite the thorough efforts for fairness, the outcome was particularly unfavorable at this moment.\n'Someone is determined to remove me from the disciplinary leader position.'\nIt was easy to guess who would go to such lengths, bypassing the confidentiality of the disciplinary committee, to cause me harm.\n'The principal is intervening in this manner.'\nThe principal was starting to perceive me as a threat, transitioning from merely an annoying figure to an outright enemy.\nIn Academy City, the power and influence of a disciplinary leader were substantial. I had achieved significant accomplishments, defeating two of the principal's subordinates, the Six Sins, and becoming widely known for these feats.\nEven for the principal, it would be difficult to bury someone like me without facing repercussions. The principal's position wasn't invincible; she wasn't a king or president.\nIf Academy City turned against her, she would have to step down. Given her secretive actions so far, it seemed she hadn't fully secured the support of the Federal Council either.\nThus, the principal aimed to gradually strip away the elements that gave me power, starting by removing me from the disciplinary leader position, which would eliminate a major obstacle for her.\n'Damn it.'\nI narrowed my eyes. As the subject of the disciplinary action, I had no power here.\nI could contest the decision through the judicial academy later, as it was a completely independent institution beyond the principal's reach. However, this process would take time, and my term as disciplinary leader would end in the meantime, leaving me with only compensation for the unfair treatment. By then, who knows what could happen to me?\nWithout any valid reason to present, applying for a stay of execution to temporarily retain my position as disciplinary leader was also impossible.\nIt was a dirty situation. However,\n'This is still within my expectations.'\nThe disciplinary committee didn't conduct a search of personal belongings. This wasn't a court of law.\nI had a small signal device in my pocket. Noticing the proceedings were skewed against me, I pressed the signal device under the pretense of adjusting my posture.\nThis signal would have reached Baek-seo, who was aware of the instructions based on the number of signals sent. She would act accordingly.\nThe interesting part was about to begin.\n\"If there are no further statements, this session is adjourned.\"\nAt that moment, the door burst open, and four students entered.\nEveryone's attention turned to them.\nThere had been no sound of footsteps outside, indicating that the four students had arrived discreetly and were waiting outside the door.\n\"!\"\nMy eyes widened upon seeing them.\n\"What is this? This is a restricted area for unauthorized personnel.\"\nThe chairman finally looked up, his eyes widening in surprise as he recognized the intruders. They were unexpected guests.\nIt was unthinkable that they would appear here, given their strained relationship with Ahseong High.\n'Why are they here?'\nEven I was puzzled by their presence.\n\"I've never called for them…\"\n\"Is it not permissible for us to be here? As a principal party to the disciplinary case, regardless of affiliation, we should have the right to participate,\" said a female student in a reddish-brown uniform, smiling brightly. Her smile was so pure and beautiful that it seemed to make flowers bloom around her.\nA badge on her left chest gleamed, signifying her high status within Academy City.\n\"You see, I was listening outside, and the more I heard…\"\nHer eyes turned icy cold.\n\"This disciplinary committee seems like a complete farce, doesn't it?\"\nShe was one of the influential figures in Academy City, Lee Yena, the student council president of Mahyeon High School.\nAccompanying her were other students wearing student council badges. For some reason, the Mahyeon High student council members had come.\nFollowing them, two more students entered: a male student with a disciplinary leader armband and a female student with a vice-leader armband.\nThey were the ones I had called.\nThey stepped forward, pushing past Yena and adjusting their glasses in unison. The male student presented his disciplinary badge.\n\"Mahyeon High Disciplinary Leader, Lee Jae-ho. This is Vice-Leader Shin Ga-yeon.\"\nThey were the disciplinary leader and vice-leader of Mahyeon High.\nThe surprised expressions of the disciplinary committee members were clear.\nLee Jae-ho's timing in intervening was pre-arranged with Ahn Woo-jin.\nIf he were one of the higher-ups opposing Woo-jin, what would he do? With this in mind, it was easy to predict that the disciplinary committee might be compromised.\nWoo-jin had discussed this possibility with Jae-ho before.\nThe position of a disciplinary leader was a significant hurdle. From an enemy's perspective, removing Woo-jin from that position would make it easier to deal with him.\nSo Jae-ho decided to help Woo-jin. Once the Mahyeon High committee members were decided, he secretly investigated them. On the day of the disciplinary committee, he waited near Ahseong High, ready to act upon receiving Baek-seo's signal.\n'Ahn Woo-jin…'\nJae-ho thought.\n'I hate to admit it, but you're capable. More than I am.'\nJae-ho still disliked Woo-jin, his feelings of resentment stronger than ever.\nBut despite his personal feelings, he couldn't deny Woo-jin's remarkable accomplishments as a disciplinary leader. The achievements spoke for themselves.\nWoo-jin's information-gathering and execution abilities were on a level that even Jae-ho had to acknowledge.\n'You shouldn't fall.'\nJae-ho admitted that Woo-jin was an indispensable figure in Academy City.\nSomeone higher up was targeting Woo-jin out of personal disdain, which was unacceptable to Jae-ho.\nAs a disciplinary leader, he wanted to protect Academy City. Therefore, he resolved to protect Woo-jin.\n\"As the school affiliated with the location of this incident and a principal party to the case, we request to participate in the disciplinary decision process and reconsider the level of disciplinary action.\"\n\"The discussion is already concluded. A decision has been made. Even if you are a principal party to the incident, we cannot allow it.\"\nThe chairman, now visibly tense due to the intervention of the Mahyeon High student council president and disciplinary leader, tried to stand his ground.\nThe chairman had the most significant authority in the disciplinary committee.\nJae-ho sneered at the chairman and spoke softly.\n\"You're a fool. Can't you understand a hint?\"\n\"What? A fool…!? Are you out of your mind? I heard you!\"\n\"I said it to be heard.\"\n\"What?\"\nJae-ho adjusted his glasses.\n\"Your decision is invalid. Mahyeon High will point out the injustice and unfairness of this disciplinary committee.\"\n\"What are you talking about!? Injustice!?\"\nThe chairman, now furious, slammed the table and stood up.\n\"We have conducted the proceedings fairly…!\"\n\"There is evidence that our Mahyeon High committee members have accepted bribes. We have already secured the evidence. The decision process of the disciplinary committee, which should be clean and fair, has been tainted, rendering the decision invalid.\"\n\"……!\"\nThe committee members were all taken aback.\nThe two Mahyeon High members were particularly shocked.\nSoon, fear spread across their faces as Jae-ho's gaze fell upon them.\nVice-Leader Shin Ga-yeon distributed copies of the evidence to the committee members. The documents contained irrefutable evidence of suspicious financial transactions and the acceptance of bribes.\nThe expressions of the committee members hardened.\n'Of course, they wouldn't have expected us to dig into the bribes accepted by our disciplinary committee members.'\nIt was challenging to investigate external committee members, but it was possible to scrutinize those selected from one's own school.\nAfter explaining the situation in writing to the student council president, the committee members were investigated.\nThe disciplinary leader had the right to request information from the student council president if there was a suspicion of unfairness in the disciplinary committee.\nThe Mahyeon High members hadn't anticipated their disciplinary leader would do such a thing.\nStudent council president Yena placed a hand on Woo-jin's shoulder and looked at the chairman.\n\"We're filing a request to recuse this disciplinary committee, including the chairman. Please reconvene with new members.\"\n\"You….\"\n\"Long time no see?\"\nYena greeted Woo-jin softly.\nThey weren't well-acquainted, but she had seen him at the first semester exchange meeting, so she greeted him warmly.\nShe whispered to him quietly, her hand shielding her mouth.\n\"I received a rough summary from my brother. I discarded it. Let's be on the same side, okay?\"\n\"…….\"\nA dazzling smile spread across Yena's face, and it seemed as if petals fluttered around her in a romantic manga-like effect.\nAmidst the shocked committee members, commotion erupted outside.\nSoon, Ahseong High student council president Han Baek-hyun entered the room, panting, with two student council members.\n\"Wait! Mahyeon High representatives, how did you get here…!?\"\n\"By car.\"\nYena answered nonchalantly, smiling.\nWith the student council president and disciplinary leader of Mahyeon High visiting Ahseong High, Baek-hyun had rushed over upon receiving the report.\nWhen high-profile figures like this visit, the guardhouse reports to the disciplinary committee, which then reports to the student council.\nThis chain of reporting exists to prevent unnecessary intervention from higher-ups for minor or non-threatening visitors.\nBaek-seo had intentionally delayed the report, allowing the Mahyeon High disciplinary leader and student council president to head straight to the disciplinary committee room without hindrance.\n\"Good to see you, Ahseong High president. Did you know something outrageous was happening here?\"\n\"Excuse me…?\"\nThe process of the disciplinary committee was confidential to outsiders. Baek-hyun would only learn of the decision and its grounds after the committee's conclusion, so he had no idea.\nWith the revelation of the Mahyeon High committee members accepting bribes and the intervention of influential figures from major academies, the chairman's expression grew increasingly grim.\nWhispering softly, a Mahyeon High student council member explained the situation to Baek-hyun.\nHis brow furrowed as he listened.\n\"What…?\"\nHe glared at the Mahyeon High members wearing disciplinary committee gowns.\n\"…Is this true? Is there evidence that those who should be the most impartial in the disciplinary committee have accepted bribes? Was the deliberation excessively biased, omitting favorable information for our disciplinary leader? Is that true?\"\n\"We didn't know about the bribes, but we conducted the proceedings fairly….\"\n\"There's no need to excuse yourself!\"\nThe Ahseong High student council member handed over the committee documents to Baek-hyun. The disgruntled Ahseong High members offered no resistance.\n\"Confiscating disciplinary committee documents is illegal…!\"\n\"Since some members have been found to have accepted bribes, the decision process and the conclusions are invalid. These documents are now null and void.\"\n\"Even so…!\"\n\"This….\"\nBaek-hyun's face turned red with anger as he read the documents.\nHis teeth clenched, and his jaw tightened.\n\"You…!\"\nHis face contorted with rage.\n\"These people!!\"\nBang!\nSuddenly, Baek-hyun ripped off his tie and threw it forcefully on the floor.\n'Here it comes!' 'The president's tie-throwing!'\nThe Ahseong High student council knew what this meant.\nIt was a clear expression of Baek-hyun's firm anger and his decision to show no mercy.\n\"Are you out of your mind!? Who do you think you are!? Do you think we're pushovers!? You think you can do this to our student!? You filthy scumbags!!\"\n\"Please calm down, president!!\"\n\"Let go!! Is Ahn Woo-jin someone who deserves such unfair treatment!? You dirty bastards!!\"\nAs Baek-hyun started causing a commotion, the committee members backed away in fear. The student council members blocked him, sweating nervously.\n'What is this…?'\nWoo-jin felt bewildered by the unexpected chaos.\n\"Yikes!\" \"Hold on!\" \"What are you doing!?\" \"Security, stop him! Quickly!\" \"He's the president…!\" \"I order you to stop immediately! Ugh!\" \"Aaaah!!\"\nTables overturned, documents and chairs flew, and the committee members scattered in panic.\nThe disciplinary committee room was in complete disarray.",

      "content": "A Few Days Ago, in the Disciplinary Committee's Office.\n'This is Kim Yeon-hee...'\nI examined Kim Yeon-hee's file on the computer. The ID photo showed that she seemed to wear large round glasses.\nHer self-introduction was submitted as a document file, so her handwriting was unknown.\nHer academic performance at Hanyang Federal Academy was in the upper-middle range.\nHer rank was estimated to be 4th rank, and her combat-related grades were high.\nThere was a note that read, \"No issues with communication, but interpersonal relationships are not smooth.\" It seemed she had trouble getting along with others.\n'If there's a connection between this girl and the Principal…'\nKim Yeon-hee had won the grand prize in a contest hosted by the Principal, earning her Platinum Mileage.\nFurthermore, with my presence firmly established in Academy City, a super-elite from Hanyang Federal Academy had now joined Ahseong High's Disciplinary Committee.\nHan Seo-jin's mission was to monitor Baek-seo, and now Han Seo-jin was crystallized and imprisoned.\nGiven these circumstances, there was enough reason to be suspicious, as Student Council Treasurer Yoon Tae-ho had suggested.\nThe problem was...\n'But would the Principal really send someone so suspicious?'\nThe fact that it seemed suspicious was itself suspicious.\n\"Hmm...\"\nWhat was this ominous feeling?\nIt felt like some unforeseen force was targeting me, like things were about to get horribly complicated—a dirty feeling.\n'Enough...'\nI leaned back in my chair and sighed.\n'I'll take a closer look at Kim Yeon-hee during the interview. But first, I need to focus on taking down the Principal.'\nThat's why I was meticulously investigating Moon Chae-yeon's underground facility.\nI needed to find evidence that could expose the Principal's crimes.\nThe top priority was to get Lee Doo-hee to resign as Principal. I had to dismantle the power that supported her and disrupt the chain of command.\n'But, will the Principal really take her own life this semester?'\nIn the original work, the Principal was supposed to take her own life this semester.\nWhy would she do that?\n'Perhaps it was Baek-seo's doing.'\nIn the original story, Baek-seo meticulously planned the assassination of the Principal and executed that plan during the second semester.\nIn other words, the Principal's suicide was likely the result of Baek-seo's actions. There was no other dramatic factor that could explain it.\n'And that plan...'\nI recalled the \"Principal Assassination Plan\" I had seen at Baek-seo's house.\nBaek-seo had devised a plan to eliminate the Principal while avoiding Seokang-jin, the strongest of the Spartoi.\nConsidering Baek-seo's competence, it was an assassination plan that had a good chance of succeeding. Though now it had become an obsolete plan.\nHowever, even if the plan had succeeded, a question remained.\n'Why did it become suicide instead of an assassination?'\nIf the plan had gone as intended, the Principal should have died by Baek-seo's blade.\nBut what was the expression on the Principal's face when she committed suicide in the original story? It was serene. As if she had accepted everything and was calmly awaiting death.\nConsidering the Principal's previous actions, such a psychological change was incomprehensible.\nHow could a person change so drastically in just one semester?\n'Anyway, I'm no longer sure the Principal will commit suicide.'\nTherefore, I needed to prepare for the worst-case scenario, in which the Principal doesn't take her own life.\nI couldn't afford to let my guard down.\nPresently.\nThe interviews for new Disciplinary Committee members were progressing smoothly.\nKim Yeon-hee appeared nervous but answered the questions adequately. I suppose you could say she was doing well enough.\nStill, she kept tapping her thigh.\n'Is that Morse code... No, it doesn't seem like it.'\nWhen I tried to interpret it as Morse code, it didn't make any sense. Maybe she was just nervous.\nI glanced sideways at Baek-seo. Her eyes were fixed on the documents. It was clear she wasn't interested in the applicants.\nI was worried that Baek-seo might ask an outlandish question, but it seemed that wouldn't be the case.\n'Kim Yeon-hee is definitely going to pass.'\nThe transfer student Kim Yeon-hee had decent grades at Hanyang Federal Academy. Her combat abilities were good, and there were no significant red flags.\nIt was practically certain she would join the Disciplinary Committee.\nFailing Kim Yeon-hee would almost be an act of misconduct.\n\"Thank you. Do you have any final remarks?\"\nEach person answered in turn.\nThere were extreme statements about stripping criminals of their flesh and bones, moderate statements about upholding justice, and doing their best.\nThen it was Kim Yeon-hee's turn.\n\"I...\"\nKim Yeon-hee took a moment to steady her breath before speaking.\n\"I want to be a Disciplinary Committee member who ensures that no criminal escapes justice and pays for their crimes. Please consider selecting me.\"\nHer eyes were filled with determination.\nHer calmness at that moment stood out compared to her earlier demeanor.\n\"......\"\nI quietly observed Kim Yeon-hee.\n'Somehow...'\nThere was nothing particularly suspicious, but...\nThere was an oddly familiar feeling.\nI couldn't quite identify the source of this unease.\nTime passed, and the interview concluded without any issues.\nI gathered the documents, stretched my shoulders, exchanged pleasantries with the other interviewers, and sent them off, leaving only me and Baek-seo in the interview room.\nBaek-seo put the sorted documents into her briefcase.\n\"You did well, Leader.\"\n\"You too.\"\n\"We need to stay strong tomorrow, right?\"\n\"Tomorrow too... Yes, we do.\"\nThere was another round of interviews tomorrow.\n'This feels overwhelming...'\nI felt like throwing up...\nOn the other hand, Baek-seo seemed relaxed.\n\"Are you heading straight to the training ground?\"\n\"I plan to. What about you?\"\n\"I'm heading straight home. I want to rest today.\"\nNo, she wasn't really relaxed.\nBaek-seo must have been exhausted too. She just wasn't showing it.\nAfter all, Baek-seo had also helped me with the HR work I brought over.\n\"Alright. Be careful on your way home. Should I bring you something for a late-night snack?\"\nBaek-seo shook her head with a soft, nasal sound.\n\"If I eat late at night, it'll be hard to restrain myself.\"\n\"Oh, right.\"\nThat made sense. Baek-seo is also a girl. And she's dating me.\nShe must be conscious of her weight...\nWait, hold on.\n\"...You meant the late-night snack, right?\"\n\"Hmm? Who knows?\"\n\"...?\"\nI tilted my head in confusion as I looked at Baek-seo.\nThat gentle smile of hers carried a hint of mischief.\n\"Well, see you later.\"\n\"Huh? Oh... Okay.\"\nBefore I could ask further, Baek-seo left the room.\nAt the Training Ground.\nI was training my unique ability as usual.\nI could feel that the penalty had been significantly delayed. Thanks to that, I was able to focus on my training without any burden, sweating profusely.\nEven as Geum-yang rolled on the floor, munching on snacks, she would eerily approach and grab my hand just before the penalty kicked in.\n\"Hoo...\"\nI caught my breath, wiped the sweat, and waited for the penalty to subside.\nThen I asked Geum-yang a question.\n\"Last time, you mentioned that it might be possible to drop a meteor from space, right?\"\n\"Indeed.\"\n\"If that's possible... wouldn't it be more effective to open a crack near the enemy and attack them with the environment on the other side of the crack? Like using the deep-sea environment to attack them?\"\nGeum-yang shook her head.\n\"That's not possible. The environment on the other side of the crack stabilizes in the wormhole. If that were possible, I would have taught you a long time ago.\"\nIn the end, it seemed the wormhole acted as a stabilizer.\n\"Even in extreme environments like absolute zero or extreme heat, the same applies. To the extent that even if you create a crack connecting here and the sun, it won't matter as long as you don't cross the crack.\"\n\"The sun too...? The wormhole is that powerful?\"\n\"You had no idea how amazing the wormhole is, did you?\"\nGeum-yang furrowed one of her eyebrows and shook her head in disbelief.\nI frowned in response.\n\"How could I know when you didn't explain it?\"\n\"Alright. Let me explain it to you.\"\nGeum-yang stepped in front of me, extended her right index finger, and held out her left fist.\n\"To ignore the laws of this world and connect random spaces means creating a distortion in spacetime. What happens if you travel through a crack without a wormhole?\"\nShe started to bring her right index finger toward her left fist but then folded her right index finger back.\n\"Whether it's your body or an object, it will be completely disassembled. The immense energy and unimaginable speed would be too much to handle. There's no way you could survive it.\"\n\"Hmm...\"\n\"To successfully travel through space in such a state, the objects that go through the crack would need to be perfectly reassembled at the destination. Maybe a single atom could make it, but anything larger would struggle.\"\nSo, you'd die, basically.\nGeum-yang extended her right index finger again.\n\"Moreover, space and time are inseparable concepts. They form a 'spacetime' continuum. Even if you successfully travel, temporal errors would occur. The side effects of that fall into the realm of the 'unknown.'\"\nShe touched her right index finger to her left fist and then bent her right index finger wildly.\nIt seemed to signify that \"something would happen.\"\n\"And what would happen?\"\n\"You might end up overlapping with your counterpart in another timeline. It would be better if that were all, but more serious problems could arise. You can't take temporal errors lightly. I don't know the details.\"\n\"...So the wormhole solves all these problems?\"\n\"Exactly. It's like a 'breakwater.'\"\nGeum-yang retracted her hands.\n\"Space travel comes with many side effects and requires an enormous amount of energy. Moreover, to control the ability, you have to deal with the distortion of spacetime. My authority and magic overcome these challenges and are integrated into the mechanism of your spatial manipulation ability as the wormhole.\"\nGeum-yang laughed and placed her hands on her hips proudly.\n\"The wormhole itself is a colossal concentration of magic energy!\"\nIt felt like a miraculous phenomenon caused by magic...\nGeum-yang pointed at me with her index finger.\n\"Even when you only channeled a little magic in the wormhole, the magic was amplified, right? That's why. And that's also why staying in the wormhole for too long negatively affects you.\"\nGeum-yang then walked over to stand next to me.\n\"Do you understand now? Even if the crack connects to an extreme environment, the wormhole stabilizes it, and you can't change the environment of a wormhole made of extreme magical energy. What's the point of adding a drop of cold water to boiling water? The only thing you can do is release the changes that happen inside the wormhole to the outside.\"\n\"I always wondered why... I think I understand it a bit better now.\"\nThe wormhole is a massive concentration of magical energy.\nThat's why even a small amount of magic channeled inside the wormhole would get amplified.\n\"But why are you only telling me this now?\"\n\"What's the point of telling a novice? It would only give you a headache.\"\n\"...That makes sense.\"\nI accepted her explanation.\n\"Now, keep training, kid. You've still got a long way to go.\"\nGeum-yang patted me on the back as she passed by.\n'The wormhole...'\nA space I was now so familiar with that I even greeted it every time I crossed a crack.\n'Is there a way to apply this?'\nSuddenly, a new concern arose.\nKim Yeon-hee settled into her seat at the theater with popcorn and a drink. The rest of the seats were empty.\nThe movie began to play on the large screen.\nIt was a late-night screening. And it had a very low rating.\nConsidering the late hour, it wasn't surprising that there were no other patrons.\nHowever, another person entered the theater.\nThat person ignored the many available seats and sat next to Yeon-hee. It was a short-haired female student.\nBut Yeon-hee didn't look at the person sitting beside her.\n\"You’re here?\"\nShe simply greeted her while munching on her popcorn.\n\"Yes.\"\nThe short-haired student, Baek-seo, answered calmly while keeping her gaze fixed on the screen.\n\"Have they gotten sloppy with surveillance?\"\n\"Yes, it's lax. There have been more and more days like this lately. It must mean the old hag's condition has worsened.\"\n\"I see.\"\n\"...Hmm?\"\nYeon-hee squinted and gave a mocking smile as she noticed the absence of Baek-seo’s weapon at her waist.\n\"Did you lose the Baekryun-do... really? The great Baek-seo walking around with just an ordinary sword. That's surprising. It must have been an important weapon.... Can't you even take care of your own things?\"\n\"Oh, right. How's your thigh? It's probably healed by now, but it must have hurt quite a bit. I’m sincerely worried about any lingering psychological pain. You have such a fragile mind, after all.\"\n\"Hehe, you reacted just as I expected.\"\nThe two exchanged words with smiles on their faces.\nThe truth that the Principal had been sowing discord between them had come to light, and the misunderstandings had been resolved.\nIn the end, the feelings left between them were a mix of the anger and hatred that had developed from fighting as enemies, and... a bit of regret.\n\"...It's been a while since I've seen modified Morse code.\"\nBaek-seo said.\nThe Principal's subordinates communicated using Morse code that had been modified according to specific rules.\nDuring the Disciplinary Committee interview, Yeon-hee had tapped her thigh, feigning nervousness, to send the modified Morse code to Baek-seo.\nOf course, Baek-seo recognized it immediately.\nThrough this, Yeon-hee had communicated the meeting place, time, movie being shown, seat location, and that she had something to discuss about the Principal.\n\"The mission must be the same as Han Seo-jin's, right?\"\n\"Yes. There's nothing to hide.\"\nIn the last semester, Han Seo-jin's mission had been to monitor Baek-seo.\nBaek-seo assumed that by now, Ahn Woo-jin would have been added to the surveillance list.\n\"By the way, your disguise skills are impressive. I didn’t recognize you at first.\"\n\"You would have figured it out eventually. You’d have noticed all my subtle habits. And I was already aware that your side was keeping a close eye on me.\"\nYeon-hee, or rather, Kim Dal-bi, took off her glasses and swept her braided silver hair forward over her shoulder.\n\"So, are you saying you're voluntarily giving up and surrendering?\"\n\"I didn't have much choice~. So I changed my approach. I decided to reveal myself and talk to you directly.\"\n\"That’s quite clever. So, what do you want to talk about?\"\nAlthough the misunderstanding had been cleared, Baek-seo did not lower her guard.\nShe had been extremely cautious on her way to this theater, checking the surroundings thoroughly.\nNo matter what, the two of them were still on opposite sides. It wouldn't have been surprising if Dal-bi suddenly turned against her.\nDal-bi watched the movie playing on the screen.\nIt was a boring movie with a low rating, so there was no point in expecting entertainment. However, it was convenient that she didn't have to awkwardly avert her gaze.\nThe sound of the movie filled the ears of the two girls.\nThe scene showed the protagonist sneaking into a house at night, holding his breath.\nHis family welcomed him, but the protagonist, suffering from amnesia due to a head injury, didn't recognize them, and the family was shocked.\nAt that moment, Dal-bi spoke again.\n\"Baek-seo, tell me why you were granted freedom.\"\nBaek-seo, despite being one of the Principal's subordinates, was now enjoying a certain level of freedom. The reason for this was kept secret.\n\"Why should I tell you?\"\nBaek-seo asked kindly.\nA shadow fell over Dal-bi's lifeless eyes.\n\"Because I'm going to take down that damn hag. So tell me the Principal's weakness. The reason you were given freedom. It’s because you’re holding onto the Principal’s weakness, right? If you fail, I can take over.\"\nDal-bi had already made up her mind.\n\"I... just can't forgive that hag.\"\n\"You know, I haven't given up on anything either.\"\n\"...Huh?\"\nDal-bi turned to Baek-seo.\n\"Since they're obviously going to target us soon, we can't just sit back and do nothing.\"\n\"'Us'?\"\n\"Our Disciplinary Committee.\"\nThe situation was beyond repair.\nEven though Woo-jin knew who the enemy was, he had chosen to side with Baek-seo. And Baek-seo had accepted him.\n\"We're going to bring that person down.\"\nSo Baek-seo was determined to fight alongside him.\n\"And….\"\nBaek-seo turned to Dal-bi, and their eyes met.\nBaek-seo's gentle smile was reflected in Dal-bi's dark eyes.\n\"You'll be joining 'us' too, won't you?\"\n\"...?\"\nDal-bi's eyes widened in surprise. Slowly, life returned to her eyes.\n\"What did you just say…?\"\nBaek-seo's words seemed to imply that she was considering Dal-bi an ally.\nCould it mean something else?\nDal-bi would need to ponder over Baek-seo's words for a while to fully grasp their meaning.\n\"Now that we've clarified our positions, it's settled. I haven't forgiven you for what you did to the Leader, but… they say the enemy of my enemy is my friend, right?\"\n\"Are you serious? Are you really changing your mind like this?\"\n\"Yes. It feels like the right thing to do.\"\nDal-bi was almost at a loss for words, but Baek-seo didn't care. It seemed Baek-seo had also been through a lot of internal struggle.\nAfter a pause, Baek-seo made a confession.\n\"You know, I liked you a lot.\"\n\"What! Why are you saying that all of a sudden…!?\"\nDal-bi's face turned red with embarrassment at the completely unexpected statement.\n\"Even though there are things about you that annoy me now, and there were misunderstandings, I had to stop you… So, I'm sorry. I did something stupid.\"\nBaek-seo scratched her cheek awkwardly as she said this.\nDal-bi, now fully understanding Baek-seo's words, was left speechless as she fell into thought, then let out a sigh of admiration.\n\"Wow…. You, really….\"\nThe words \"how unfair\" escaped Dal-bi's lips quietly, followed by a small chuckle.\nThe heavy atmosphere instantly lightened.\nDal-bi had declared her intention to oppose the Principal, and Baek-seo had resolved the misunderstandings she had held against Dal-bi.\nThe negative feelings between them were not that significant, and in fact, Baek-seo had even liked Dal-bi as a friend.\nThere was no longer anything between them that could keep them apart.\nGiven this, Baek-seo didn't want to leave Dal-bi on her own anymore.\n\"So, don't go it alone.\"\nBaek-seo leaned in toward Dal-bi as she spoke.\n\"From now on, let’s do it together. We promised, didn't we?\"\n\"Promised…?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nBaek-seo nodded.\nShe recalled a time in their childhood when they had picked peony flowers together in a flower field.\n\"Remember, when we picked peony flowers and vowed to properly confront that person? Back then….\"\n\"……?\"\n\"So, back then….\"\nBaek-seo's smile slowly faded.\nBecause Dal-bi's expression showed she couldn't recall a single memory.\nA sense of foreboding gripped Baek-seo.\n\"When did we ever… do that…?\"\nDal-bi's cautious question brought Baek-seo to a standstill.\nThe sound stopped. The movie had reached a quiet scene.\nIt was a scene where the protagonist, who had lost his memory, stared blankly at the meadow with his father, struggling to recall memories that wouldn't come.",

      "content": "Swoosh!\nA dark blade cut through the air.\nIt was the weekend. In New Yongsan Street.\nIn the workshop’s test room, Baek-seo continuously swung the black sword.\nMultiple elegant sword paths were carved into the air, as if watching a dancer with a beautifully fluid motion.\nI was momentarily entranced by the sight, but soon regained my composure.\n\"Baek-seo, how does it feel?\"\n\"Hmm.\"\nBaek-seo stopped her movements.\n\"It will take some time to get used to it, but once I do, I think it’ll be better than the Baekryun-do. It’s definitely good.\"\n\"That’s a relief.\"\nThe sword Baek-seo was wielding was newly crafted using the Platinum Mileage she had acquired in middle school and kept in reserve.\nThe workshop was a place I had found using my knowledge from the original work.\nAfter the recent Moon Chae-yeon incident, Baek-seo lost her sword, the Baekryun-do.\nSince the Baekryun-do was a sword she was already familiar with, I was worried whether she would find a replacement that suited her, but it was a relief that this new weapon was even better.\n\"Hyunundo…\"\nBaek-seo murmured as she looked at the sword in her hand.\nThe sharp black blade reflected the light.\nHyunundo (玄雲刀)\n.\nThe Baekryun-do was named for its white wheel-shaped guard, hence the name Baekryun-do (White Wheel Sword).\nThe current sword, Hyunundo, enhances the Thundercloud domain of the unique ability\nUnsight\n, and its clean, black blade stood out, earning it the name\nHyunundo\n—meaning \"Black Cloud Sword.\"\n'The Baekryun-do was a good weapon, but the Hyunundo seems like an upgrade.'\nI felt a sense of pride.\nIt was like the satisfaction of giving your favorite character a new piece of equipment in an online game. Well, it’s been a long time since I played online games, so I’m not sure if that’s the best comparison.\n\"I’m satisfied. I was honestly a bit worried. How did you manage to find such a good place?\"\n\"I know a bit about these things. I did some research back when I was looking for the\nIron Dragon Staff\n.\"\n\"You're thorough, Leader…. I’ll repay you later.\"\nBaek-seo smiled brightly.\n'This is healing…'\nIt felt like I was being compensated for the grueling week I had just endured.\nBut.\n\"…….\"\n\"?\"\nBaek-seo seemed deep in thought as she stared at the Hyunundo.\nNormally, I would’ve thought she was just contemplating the new sword, but she had been lost in thought quite often recently, which made me worry.\n\"Baek-seo.\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"I’ve been thinking about something lately, and I hope you don’t take this the wrong way. Is everything okay? Nothing’s been bothering you recently, has it?\"\nI asked directly, and Baek-seo looked at me with curiosity.\n\"Why do you ask that all of a sudden?\"\n\"You seem troubled. I’m not entirely confident, but I think I can read your expressions to some extent.\"\nI had been watching Baek-seo’s face for a long time.\nBecause of that, I had learned to distinguish her expressions somewhat. I could usually tell when something was wrong.\nRecently, Baek-seo often seemed troubled, even without realizing it. It appeared that she was struggling to hide her emotions.\n\"Well…. Honestly, thinking about the Baekryun-do, which I had grown attached to, does make my chest ache a bit.\"\nThat didn’t sound entirely truthful.\nBaek-seo rarely shared her concerns. Even though we were now in a relationship.\nI wondered if she was waiting for another major incident to happen before she would open up about her struggles.\n\"You don’t believe me, do you?\"\n\"...If you ever feel like talking, let me know.\"\n\"You’ve become more perceptive, Leader?\"\n\"I’ve always been perceptive….\"\nI had always been somewhat perceptive.\nIf she wasn’t ready to talk, then it was fine. I would just have to wait.\nWe left New Yongsan Street and boarded the back seats of a bus together. Since it was still before evening, there were few passengers.\nI focused on the view outside the window as the bus moved.\nThese days, I would take any opportunity to train, even in everyday situations.\nMy gaze was fixed on the outskirts, where a crescent-shaped rock stood. I had familiarized myself with its location beforehand.\n‘Setting coordinates on the rock… is still difficult.’\nIt wasn’t hard to set coordinates in an unseen location. The problem was doing so at a distant and specific target.\nYes, my current training was focused on setting coordinates on the crescent-shaped rock.\n─ ‘If you create a crack adjacent to the object you want to move, you can forcibly pull that object into the wormhole. Then, the object will follow the flow of the wormhole and move to the other end of the crack. Concepts that are intangible, like temperature or water pressure, are difficult, but solid objects like rocks are possible.’\nA few days ago, Geum-yang had explained the technique she demonstrated to me.\nThe idea was to pull the object into the crack using its own force to enable spatial movement. The environment outside the crack doesn’t affect the wormhole.\nGeum-yang had suggested imagining an “invisible hand,” but I still didn’t fully understand that explanation.\n\"Leader.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nBaek-seo’s voice interrupted my concentration.\nI canceled the coordinate setting and turned to her.\n\"Do you still carry that charm with you?\"\n\"Charm?\"\nI took out the purple peony charm from my inner pocket.\n\"This?\"\nBaek-seo nodded.\n\"You said the person who gave you that charm was someone you liked a lot, right?\"\n\"Well…\"\nWait a minute.\nWas I really talking about someone I liked in front of my current girlfriend?\n\"Someone like that, I guess.\"\n\"Was it an ex-girlfriend?\"\n\"No, it’s not…\"\n\"I’m just kidding.\"\n\"…….\"\nWithout any intention of hearing me out, Baek-seo quickly cut me off.\nAlthough her expression didn’t change, I felt a brief, cold sensation and a sense of danger to my life.\n\"So, why do you ask?\"\n\"What if the person who gave you that charm forgot that they gave it to you?\"\nWhat did she mean by that?\n\"Dementia or memory loss? Is that what you mean?\"\n\"Yes. Let’s assume they have Alzheimer’s.\"\nWas this related to the struggles Baek-seo had been dealing with?\nI decided to answer in a calm, but serious manner to avoid making the atmosphere too heavy.\n\"Well… it would be sad, but would it change anything? The value of the charm they gave me wouldn’t change just because they forgot. Even if I felt disappointed that they forgot, if it happened because of something like Alzheimer’s, then there’s nothing I can do about it.\"\n\"What if they start forgetting more and more?\"\n\"What are you trying to say?\"\nI narrowed my eyes.\nI couldn’t help but ask, as it seemed she was implying a worse situation.\nBaek-seo closed her eyes and leaned her head against the seat back.\n\"Just like the person who gave you that charm is precious to you, there’s someone precious to me as well.\"\nBaek-seo answered with a gentle tone, like a kindergarten teacher speaking to a child.\n\"Are you talking about that withered flower in your room?\"\n\"I see you noticed that. Yes, that one. That person gave it to me.\"\nI had seen it when I went to her house looking for her the other day.\nBaek-seo seemed to have quickly deduced how I had seen the withered flower and responded without any hesitation.\n\"Are you saying that person has lost their memory?\"\n\"That’s the feeling.\"\nSo that was Baek-seo’s struggle.\nShe had been roundabout, but now she was finally speaking honestly.\n\"And that person also gave you a peony, huh.\"\n\"Yes.\"\nI paused for a moment and imagined it.\nWhat if Kim Dal-bi forgot that she gave me the peony charm? What if she forgot about me?\nHow would I feel?\n\"…….\"\n\"Leader?\"\nProbably…\n\"It would be hard for both of us. That’s all I can say.\"\nIt would hurt a lot.\nThe last time, at the hospital, I had been harsh to Dal-bi as a sort of desperate outburst.\nNo matter what story Dal-bi had, we were on opposing sides.\nAs the Disciplinary Leader, I was responsible for the safety of Ahseong High's jurisdiction, while Dal-bi, on the contrary, was a terrorist who wreaked havoc.\nAs I’ve said before, our relationship had ceased to be just between the two of us.\nIt had become a war, with responsibility and the safety of many people involved.\nSo, no matter what story Dal-bi had.\nUnless Dal-bi openly betrayed the Principal and returned to me, unless she relied on me, I couldn’t allow myself to get closer to her.\nBut… human emotions aren’t that simple.\nThe peony charm still held great significance to me.\nI didn’t want to lose that evidence that Dal-bi had cared about me.\nThat was my honest feeling, and because of that, I couldn’t afford to treat Dal-bi kindly, even if it meant making an enemy of my own heart.\nThis charm was initially a symbol of longing, but it had now become a symbol of regret. If I couldn’t deny my feelings, I could only endure by holding onto this charm. That was my resolve.\nSo if Dal-bi forgot about this charm and me.\nEven though I wouldn’t drop my guard, I wouldn’t be able to avoid the emotional pain. That wasn’t something I could control.\nI didn’t know who the person Baek-seo was talking about was. But I knew that Baek-seo must have relationships I wasn’t aware of. It was clear that she was troubled.\nSo I decided not to dig too deeply into her pain.\nBaek-seo looked at me for a moment before raising the corners of her lips.\n\"…You’re quite understanding, Leader.\"\n\"Understanding? It’s more like avoiding. No matter what I say, it would be meddling. I haven’t experienced it firsthand. If I were to go through that situation… I don’t know what I’d think or what decisions I’d make. I’m sorry I can’t be of more help.\"\nNo matter what I said with my limited experience, values, and mindset, I wouldn’t be able to resolve the concerns weighing on Baek-seo.\n\"Hmm, no.\"\nBaek-seo shook her head with a smile. Then she replied in a gentle voice.\n\"I wasn’t asking for a solution. Just trying to understand is enough. Maybe that’s the answer I wanted most.\"\n\"If it comforted you, then I’m glad.\"\nAfter that, our conversation ended. Since Baek-seo seemed lost in thought, I stopped talking.\nEventually, Baek-seo subtly looked over the seats ahead of us. There were only about three other passengers. Not many.\nWe were in the back seat. Not the most conspicuous seat in the back, but still.\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\"Just checking if it’s a good environment for some affection.\"\n\"?\"\n\"No problems here.\"\nSuddenly, Baek-seo gently wrapped her arm around mine.\nThe soft, intimate sensation made my body tense up, and I inadvertently shivered.\n\"Wait, Baek-seo? Doing this in a public place…\"\n\"It’s fine as long as we don’t get caught.\"\nBaek-seo smiled contentedly with her eyes closed.\n‘Isn’t that a criminal mindset…?’\nIf someone saw us, it would definitely be an inappropriate scene for public decency…\nBut since I had already acknowledged Baek-seo as my girlfriend in my heart, it was difficult to easily escape this situation.\nThe image of Baek-seo at Moon Chae-yeon’s hideout suddenly came to mind.\nThe Baek-seo now seemed incredibly precious to me.\n‘Well… I guess it’s fine.’\nI was a 6th rank. It was easy to sense the gaze of others.\nIf a problem arose, I’d let go then.\nFor now, I could indulge in this luxury of enjoying a happy moment.",

      "content": "\"I burned out completely….\"\nFinally, the recruitment for new members of the Disciplinary Committee for the second semester was over.\nI wanted to stretch out and relax immediately, but instead, I calmly closed my eyes and took a deep breath.\nThis is the Disciplinary Committee Executive Office. The reason was that the executives were present.\n“Chief, have some refreshments.” “Oh, thank you.”\nBaek-seo brought out cookies and black tea. It was perfect timing, as if she had been waiting for this moment.\n“Is all the work done?” “Yes, just finished.” “Hehe, good job.”\nClunk.\nSuddenly, the cabinet door swung open.\nFrom inside, Park Min-hyuk, who had been working on a laptop, popped out like a squirrel, looked me in the eye, and shouted.\n“Chief, thank you for your hard work!”\nHe clenched his fist and enthusiastically flattered me.\n“Your attention to detail in selecting new members for the HR team, even for the sake of the future of the Disciplinary Committee! Truly, a role model for all students!”\n“Uh, yeah….”\nIsn’t that a bit much?\n“To reward you for your hard work, I’ll give you a massage. I’ve been waiting for this moment.”\n“A massage? If you’re offering, I’ll gratefully accept.”\nMin-hyuk approached me and began to tap my shoulders.\n‘It’s more refreshing than I expected…?’\nMin-hyuk, being a rare healer, was only a third-rank, so I didn’t expect much strength from him, but surprisingly, the massage was quite relaxing.\n“I’m glad to finally use the skills I honed during the vacation for you, Chief!” “No need to go that far… But thank you.”\nAt this point, am I getting used to the pressure?\nNo, to be honest, I don’t mind him flattering me and trying to be helpful. It’s one of the reasons I care about Min-hyuk.\nMaybe that’s why. I can see why office workers in my past life would flatter their business partners or superiors.\nWell, the situation here isn’t much different.\nEven if it’s superficial, it’s hard not to feel good, and since Min-hyuk isn’t even being superficial, I find it even more likable.\n“Huh?”\nFrom the sofa, Yoo Do-ha slowly peeked her head over the backrest and stared at me. Or rather, it felt more like she was glaring at me.\n“Yoo Do-ha, is there something you want to say?” “I’m not pleased that someone as busy as you helped out unnecessarily with a task that could have been handled by the HR team. You’re just creating more work for yourself.”\nHer tone was the exact opposite of Min-hyuk’s, laced with thorns.\n“What’s the problem with that? I’m sure I’ve explained my reasons.” “Hmph, whatever.”\nDo-ha snorted and lay back down on the sofa.\n‘What’s her problem?’\nDoes she have a grudge against me?\nI couldn’t figure it out.\nJust then, I heard the sound of someone running outside the door.\n“Huff!”\nWhoosh!\nBang!\nLike someone fleeing to a shelter after hearing an air raid siren, Min-hyuk quickly dove back into the cabinet and closed the door.\nI looked toward the cabinet. Min-hyuk’s sudden reaction made sense. His tormentor was approaching.\nSoon, the office door burst open.\n“Ta-da! Wild Ha Ye-song has appeared!”\nHa Ye-song made a grand entrance.\nEveryone greeted her.\n“Hey, Chief, Chief~.”\nYe-song immediately approached me.\n‘What is this?’\nWhat’s she hiding behind her back?\nYe-song was grinning, as if something good had happened.\n“Is there something going on?” “We’ve only been dealing with serious issues lately, right?”\nThat’s true.\nThere was the case of Baek-seo’s disappearance and abduction. The large-scale battle with Moon Chae-yeon. The discovery of connections between the Six Sinners and a mysterious figure behind them. Ongoing investigations.\nThere hasn’t been anything remotely pleasant.\nMoreover, the investigations are still ongoing.\nMoon Chae-yeon hasn’t even woken up yet.\n“We even caught the Technomancer, and it was concluded that you weren’t at fault, Chief! But isn’t it unfair that we haven’t gotten anything for it!? This is unjust treatment!”\nYe-song was passionately arguing.\nTechnically, the Disciplinary Committee’s achievements have piled up, but can that really be called a reward?\n‘There hasn’t been any tangible reward, that’s true.’\n“Yeah, but so what?” “Amid all this! I’ve brought something amazing. Want to see?”\nWhat could it be?\n“Park Min-hyuk! You too, come out and see!” “Hic!”\nYe-song opened the cabinet and forcibly dragged Min-hyuk out. Min-hyuk was startled, like a vampire exposed to sunlight.\n“Do-ha too!”\nDo-ha got up from the sofa and approached, while Baek-seo, who had been quietly observing from behind, came closer to me.\nAs we all focused on Ye-song,\n“Tada!”\nYe-song placed something she had hidden behind her back onto my desk.\nIt was a luxurious letter.\n“A letter?” “Isn’t that the Federation Council’s seal?”\nMin-hyuk exclaimed in surprise. Indeed, the envelope bore the seal of the Federation Council.\n“I just picked it up and came straight here!”\nYe-song spread her fingers in a V sign.\n“Considering the timing, just after our tremendous achievements and the end of the disciplinary hearing, a letter from the Federation Council? This has to be a reward! My instincts are telling me so!” “Calm down.”\nYe-song was excited, her breath coming in puffs.\nThe letter was addressed to five members of the Ahseong High Disciplinary Committee.\n‘A reward, huh…. Last time, they informed us via email.’\nLast semester, I received an email from the Federation Council informing me that I had earned Platinum Mileage.\n‘But a letter all of a sudden?’\nThe Federation Council only uses analog letters for significant matters.\nIn other words, this wasn’t just a letter about receiving a reward.\nRiiip.\nI opened the envelope and pulled out its contents.\nIt was indeed a letter.\nI unfolded it immediately.\nBlank.\nThe entire letter was empty, except for five marks at the bottom.\nEach mark had an image of a fingerprint.\n“It’s a fingerprint recognition system. Everyone, place your fingers on it.” “Good thing all five of us are here!”\nAs we each placed our fingers on the designated marks, the letter began to glow as magical energy surged up, and text appeared, shining brightly.\nSoon, the light from the text faded.\nAfter removing our fingers, we began to read the newly revealed contents of the letter.\nOr rather, there wasn’t much to read.\n[To the Ahseong High Disciplinary Committee. Three days from now, on Thursday, at 3 PM. We will send someone.]\n“Hmm…?”\nA silence followed.\nYe-song carefully examined the letter to see if there was anything else, but there wasn’t.\nIt was simply a direct message, without even the usual formalities.\nSoon.\nFwoosh!\n“Whoa!”\nWhen the letter caught fire, Ye-song was startled and dropped it, stepping back. Min-hyuk almost fell over.\nThe letter was quickly consumed by flames.\nIt was a natural ignition caused by magic. The letter itself was a magical artifact developed by the Federation Council.\n“Oh…?”\nYe-song let out a sound close to admiration.\n“What, what is this…? Chief, could this be a death threat or something…?”\nMin-hyuk was terrified.\nA death threat. Given the performance, it feels similar.\n“Hey, Min-hyuk. Think for a moment. Would it really be that?”\nYe-song lightly tapped her forehead with her index finger, but she also seemed a bit flustered.\nDo-ha, too, appeared tense.\nAfter all, the Federation Council had just sent a letter saying they would send someone. They seemed worried that another incident like the last disciplinary hearing might occur.\nI needed to ease their anxiety quickly.\n“Just like Ye-song initially said, this is indeed a reward letter.” “Huh?” “Here. The color of the seal is the same as the one they use when giving rewards.”\nThough the letter was gone, the envelope remained. I pointed to the seal on it.\n“Oh? Really? The seal color indicates that?” I knew because I had seen it in the original story.\nIf the seal was gold, it meant a reward.\n“How did you know that? I’ve never heard of such information….” “Chief, that’s not something you’d find on the internet.”\nThe reason you wouldn’t find it online was that it was extremely rare to receive a letter from the Federation Council.\nEven if someone did receive a letter, they often wouldn’t post it online just in case.\nGiven how the letter burned itself, it strongly implied that its contents shouldn’t be disclosed. That’s probably why.\n“I happened to learn about it by coincidence, having received rewards from the Federation Council twice during the first semester. Is that really important?” “You seem especially competent today, Chief….” “I’ve always been competent.”\nYe-song needed to refrain from making her usual nonsensical remarks.\n“Anyway, don’t worry too much.”\nRelief washed over Ye-song, Min-hyuk, and Do-ha’s faces.\n“If the Chief says so, then….” “If the Chief says so, I’d even believe it if he said dogs meow.”\nAt that point, you don’t need to believe it.\nAnyway.\n‘Even though I said that, something still feels off.’\nI had a bad feeling about this.\n…\n“Chief of the Disciplinary Committee, hello~. We’ve come from the Federation Council!”\nThree days later.\nTwo people from the Federation Council’s Spartan division arrived at the Disciplinary Committee’s reception room.\nOne of them, a girl wearing a nun’s habit over her school uniform, smiled warmly at me.\n“…Welcome.”\nShe was a direct subordinate of the Principal.\nOne of the strong in Neo Seoul, Son Ye-seo.",

      "content": "Son Ye-seo.\nShe wasn’t a character involved in the main scenario of the original story.\nHowever, perhaps because of her nun’s habit, her image was one that players could hardly forget.\nEven in the event stories, she didn’t hold much significance—a character almost relegated to the role of an extra.\nStill, the fact that she was part of the Spartan Division hinted that her combat prowess was among the strongest in Neo Seoul.\n‘I never expected a subordinate of the Principal to come.’\nA sense of caution rose within me.\nBaek-seo was also keeping her expression in check. However, a chilling air surrounded her. She seemed to recognize who Son Ye-seo was.\nThat made sense.\nBaek-seo was also a Spartan and a subordinate of the Principal.\n“We are Spartoi. We’ve come as representatives of the Federation Council. We’ve met before, haven’t we?”\n“We saw each other at the New Yongsan Street.”\nThe Spartoi do not have an official name known to the public. The intention is that no one outside the power circles of Academy City should be able to call upon them.\nSo, they simply refer to themselves as Spartoi. Of course, they might have nicknames among themselves.\n“Yes, that’s right~.”\nClap!\nYe-seo clapped her hands and smiled broadly.\n“To think we would meet again like this! Could this be the guidance of the Lord?”\n“Perhaps it is. Please, have a seat. You must be tired from your long journey.”\n“Then, I’ll gladly accept.”\nYe-seo and her companion sat down, and I took a seat opposite them. Baek-seo brought out tea.\nThough the atmosphere in the reception room was heavy, Ye-seo continued to smile benevolently.\nOn the surface, she seemed oblivious. But in reality, she wasn’t likely to be so unaware.\nThis kind of meeting is typically a test of who can better pretend not to know what the other knows.\n“I would love to spend time chatting with you in a long and enjoyable conversation, but unfortunately, I’m short on time, and you, Chief, must be busy as well. Shall we get straight to the point?”\n“Yes, that’s fine.”\n“Alright. Then I’ll convey the Federation Council’s intentions.”\nYe-seo took out a document from her bag, cleared her throat, and began to read the contents.\nHer tone was clear and articulate.\n“‘Our Federation Council greatly values the contributions of those who helped maintain order in Neo Seoul by capturing the Six Sinners and the Technomancer. As a result, we have decided to provide appropriate rewards to all who participated in the battle. This decision was made in consideration of the outcome of the disciplinary hearing regarding Chief Ahn Woo-jin.’”\nA reward, huh. That’s good.\nAnd yet…\n‘The disciplinary hearing….’\nThe bribery charges related to the recent disciplinary hearing are still under investigation by the Hanyang Federation Academy.\nThe specific details of who approached the disciplinary committee members and how they were bribed are unknown.\nIn fact, I think it’s unnecessary to know. The Principal is likely behind it, and no matter how serious the situation, the investigation will undoubtedly be brushed aside.\nOnly the disciplinary committee members who committed illegal acts will be criminally punished without the mastermind being revealed.\n“‘The regulation restricting the issuance of Platinum Mileage was established to prevent inflation; however, if more than two-thirds of the Federation Council agrees, the number of recipients can be increased, or the issuance timing can be adjusted. Therefore, all members of the Ahseong High Disciplinary Committee who participated in the capture of the Technomancer will receive Platinum Mileage within a week.’”\nI could already picture the grinning faces of Park Min-hyuk and Ha Ye-song when they hear this.\n“Ah, ‘With the exception of outsiders, others who participated in the battle will not receive Platinum Mileage since they are not part of the Disciplinary Committee. However, they will be awarded a substantial amount of Gold Mileage.’”\nIt seems that Ise-a and the Volunteer Department will also receive rewards. They’ll be ecstatic.\nBut so far, it’s all just sweet talk.\nEven if they’re offering a generous reward, Baek-seo and I couldn’t just be happy about it.\nThe main point usually comes at the end.\n“‘However… Considering the gravity of the situation and the fact that two of the Six Sinners have been captured, the Federation Council has judged that it would be difficult for a single academy to handle all of them. The situation’s seriousness is also significant. Nevertheless, our Federation Council respects the autonomy of each academy while adhering to the law. Therefore.’”\nYe-seo looked directly into my eyes with wide, expectant eyes.\n“‘We request the cooperation of the Spartan Division under the Federation Council in the investigation’… it says?”\n“……”\nNo matter how hard I tried to maintain a poker face, I couldn’t stop my expression from gradually hardening.\nAllowing the Spartoi to intervene was essentially letting them take control of the investigation.\nTo maintain order in Academy City, the autonomy of each academy must be respected.\nBut the opponent here is the Federation Council.\nThe highest authority in Neo Seoul. An entity that reigns above even the Central Academy, Hanyang Federation Academy.\nIf we oppose the will of the Federation Council, we must be prepared for the consequences.\nNo academy would want to put themselves in such a difficult position. No academy would dare to defy the Federation Council.\n‘It’s essentially a “request” disguised as an “order.” But…’\nThere was no need to hesitate.\n“I refuse.”\n“Oh?”\nYe-seo’s eyebrows twitched. Her expression revealed that she found my response intriguing.\nThe Federation Council itself might not be our enemy. Their concern about us handling two of the Six Sinners, who were such a menace to Neo Seoul, is understandable and not unreasonable.\nThe problem was that one of the Principal’s subordinates was embedded among the Spartoi.\nThe person right in front of me was both a subordinate of the Principal and a representative of the Federation Council.\nAccepting the Federation Council’s involvement in the investigation would essentially be laying out a bridge for the Principal.\nIf that happened, it wouldn’t be surprising if evidence was destroyed, key witnesses were eliminated, or the case was covered up in some way.\n“This is the Disciplinary Committee’s matter. Strictly speaking, the Federation Council is not our superior, is it?”\nThe Federation Council is the ruling power in this city, but officially, they are just a group related to Hanyang Federation Academy. They hold no direct authority over Ahseong High.\nOf course, they can easily exert pressure on us, but that’s not the issue here.\n“Are you serious? Shouldn’t you at least discuss this with the Student Council…?”\n“The authority to investigate lies solely with me, the Chief of the Disciplinary Committee. There’s no need to discuss it. Even if our Student Council decides to follow the Federation Council’s wishes, the Disciplinary Committee has no intention of complying.”\nIt felt as though an eerie wind was passing through.\nIn a normal negotiation or conversation, I wouldn’t have been this aggressive.\nI would have sent them back, saying I’d discuss it with the Student Council and get back to them. Then I would have taken time to figure out how to politely reject the Federation Council’s request. At the very least, I would have pretended to “carefully consider” their request as a formality.\nBut my answer now was neither gentle nor open to negotiation.\nI knew this. I was that resolute.\n“Hmm.”\nYe-seo seemed taken aback by my firmness. Soon, she composed herself, shrugging one shoulder with a relaxed smile.\n“I may just be a representative, and it might be out of place for me to say this, but aren’t you worried about what might happen?”\n“What do you mean by ‘what might happen’?”\n“What do you think?”\nYe-seo leaned in, shielding her mouth with her hand, and whispered in my ear. I leaned in as well to hear her small voice.\n“Disadvantages.”\n“……”\n“They’re a stubborn group of old folks. Their pride is enormous. They won’t like this.”\nWas this a warning?\n“I don’t care.”\n“Is that so….”\nWe both leaned back into our chairs.\n“If you’re that determined, I understand.”\nYe-seo said this, but it seemed she had already grasped my thoughts. Her expression didn’t show any doubt.\nShe probably assumed that after we rescued Baek-seo, I had learned some secret about the Principal from her. Given that assumption, deducing my thoughts would be a piece of cake.\nPerhaps the reason the Principal sent Ye-seo here was to observe my reaction and report back.\n“It’s unfortunate. Well, it seems our discussion is over.”\n“Yes.”\n“Oh, don’t worry about the rewards; they’ll be given out as promised. That’s a separate matter.”\nYe-seo smiled contentedly as she sipped her tea.\n“This tea is delicious.”\n“I’m glad to hear that.”\n…\nAfter the Spartoi left, things unfolded as expected.\n─ Hey, Ahn Woo-jin. “Yes, President.”\nA direct call came from Han Baek-hyun, the Student Council President of Ahseong High. I immediately put it on speakerphone.\n─ I got a call from the Federation Council. What’s this about? You refused to cooperate and sent them away?\nAs expected, they must have been informed by the Spartoi.\nWhile I heard it as “intervention,” it seems they told the President it was about “cooperation.”\n“It’s exactly as I said. I refused on my own since the authority to investigate lies with me.”\n─ Hey!!\nBaek-hyun’s loud voice made me pull my head back from the phone.\n‘Geez, his voice is so loud.’\nIt was loud enough to echo through the Disciplinary Committee Executive Office. My ears were ringing.\nThe executives around me quietly stared at me.\n─ You didn’t even discuss such an important matter with me…! Are you out of your mind!? “Because your opinion didn’t matter.” ─ Yeah! Good job! I’m glad you’re so clear-headed!\n“…Excuse me?”\nWhat?\nDid I just hear that wrong?\nIt seemed out of context with the conversation, but as Baek-hyun’s grumbling continued, I realized I hadn’t misheard.\n─ How dare they try to intervene in our affairs? Seriously! These guys, trying to stick their spoons into a meal already cooked! Even if it’s the Federation Council, I won’t stand for it! “?” ─ With things like this, huh!? You have to flatly refuse so they don’t think of trying to convince you again. You’ve made a perfect first move! If the Federation Council starts employing other tactics, it’ll mean they have some suspicious intent. “President? No, senior…?” ─ Ahn Woo-jin, remember this. The Disciplinary Committee of Ahseong High will handle this case. That’s my decision. Got it?\nWhy…?\n‘I thought I’d be scolded for sure?’\nWhen I refused the Federation Council’s request, I was prepared for a confrontation with the Student Council President.\nNo matter how much Baek-hyun was known for taking care of his people, he was also someone who valued achievements, even holding exchange meetings with the Disciplinary Committee of Mahyeon High, which had a long-standing rivalry with Ahseong High.\nIf anyone would recoil at the idea of opposing the Federation Council, it would be him.\nSo I was completely taken aback.\n“If you’re saying that… But, are you sure?”\nI was actually worried because he was supporting me so much.\n─ I’ll be the one facing the external pressure before it even reaches you.\nRight.\nThat’s why I thought he’d scold me.\n─ I’ll handle as much as I can, so you focus on dealing with the Six Sinners. “…Did you eat something strange? Or did you catch some illness?” ─ You even criticize when I’m helping. “Why are you doing this? You’re not usually like this.” ─ What do you think? I’m doing what I believe is right. That’s all.\nClick.\nThe call ended with that cryptic response.\nI was left stunned by the unexpected reaction from the Student Council President.\nBaek-seo approached and asked,\n“Is the President… injured?”\nInstead of saying ‘that’s a relief,’ she asked why Baek-hyun was acting this way, indicating that she had the same questions as I did.\n“I don’t know….”\nThe President…\nIs something going on?\nAhseong High Student Council President’s Office.\nStudent Council President Han Baek-hyun was breathing heavily as he reviewed documents. Beads of sweat were forming on his forehead.\n“Damn it… Am I doing the right thing…?”\nHis body trembled with anxiety.\n“Yeah, this is the right thing…. The Federation Council isn’t all that…. They’re just people like us.”\nHe kept mumbling to himself, trying to calm his pounding chest.\nThe report filed by the Disciplinary Committee after capturing the Six Sinners. Someone’s intent to remove Ahn Woo-jin from his position as Disciplinary Committee Chief, even to the extent of bribing the Disciplinary Committee members. The mystery hidden within the Six Sinners incident. The secret tip from the Mahyeon High Student Council President that someone higher up seemed to be targeting Ahn Woo-jin.\nWith such clear evidence, it was impossible not to deduce that there was a connection between the Six Sinners incident and the powers that be.\nA connection even a Student Council President from a top academy couldn’t contend with.\n‘There’s a huge secret hidden in this city that must not be allowed to come to light, and Ahn Woo-jin is now touching it.’\nBecause of that deduction, Baek-hyun had been deeply troubled.\nHe recalled what happened earlier when a representative from the Federation Council called him directly to inform him that Ahn Woo-jin had refused their cooperation request.\nIt was easy to grasp the hidden meaning behind that message. ‘You should handle the pressure and clean up the situation.’\n‘Am I just a worm to them…?’\nIt was clear that, for his future, bowing down to the Federation Council was the right move.\nScolding and pressuring Ahn Woo-jin, who was on his side, to carry out the Federation Council’s wishes was the right thing to do.\nBut that was no reason to condone injustice.\nBaek-hyun ended his internal debate and made a decision.\nThe value more important to him was protecting Neo Seoul.\nA Neo Seoul controlled and manipulated by someone else wasn’t the place he wanted to live in. If that were the case, the meaning of all the achievements he had accumulated as Student Council President would be lost.\nMoreover, Ahn Woo-jin, the Chief of the Ahseong High Disciplinary Committee, along with the Disciplinary Committee Chief and Student Council President of Mahyeon High, had already resolved to fight against the secrets hidden within this city.\nNo, they were already fighting.\nThere was no way he, as the Student Council President of Ahseong High, could just sit back and do nothing.\n‘I’ll block everything I can.’\nAt least in the case of the Six Sinners, Baek-hyun would shield Ahn Woo-jin from all external pressure, like a wall or a shield, so that he could focus on the case.\nAfter all, he was the only one in a position to do so.\nAhn Woo-jin’s abilities as Chief were undeniably outstanding. He was tough and possessed an unyielding determination that most couldn’t match. He was worth betting on.\nRiiiing.\nSuddenly, the phone rang.\nBaek-hyun answered.\n─ President, there’s a call from Hanyang. It seems they want to discuss the Federation Council matter… Should I put them through?\nThe secretary’s voice trembled as she sensed the situation.\nBaek-hyun tightly closed his eyes. His brow furrowed.\n“Sigh….”\nA deep sigh filled the room.\nIt was easy to predict. Soon, external pressures from all sorts of places would come crashing down, the kind that would make one feel suffocated just by hearing their names.\nOf course, Baek-hyun felt afraid.\nFor someone who had only ever cared about achievements, the burden of fighting for the city was immense.\nHe didn’t know where this choice would lead.\nBut he had no intention of reversing the decision he had already made.\nBecause he believed it was the right choice.\nThud!\nBaek-hyun irritably loosened his school tie and threw it onto the desk.\n“Put the call through.”\nFor now, all he could do was fight.",

      "content": "Neo Seoul's hottest topics are usually dominated by Se-In High School, where the protagonist, Lee Tae-seong, is enrolled.\nDespite Se-In High being one of the most secure major academies, incidents never ceased to occur there. Rather than a series of minor events, each incident was significant in its own right.\nThe execution of carefully planned dark rituals, the activation of forbidden black magic, and the attacks from hostile groups against Se-In High were just a few examples.\nEach time something like that happened, the students of Se-In High would band together to overcome the crises.\nIt was as if they were living in a continuous sequence of movie, drama, or comic book scenarios.\nThis was the stage of the main scenario. The focus of the world was naturally drawn to where the protagonist was.\nBecause of this, incidents occurring at other academies tended to be overshadowed.\nFor example, when the Ahseong High Disciplinary Committee Chief, Ahn Woo-jin, collapsed Anomia, when a necromancer from the Six Sinners appeared at Ahseong High, and when they captured the Technomancer—these events barely managed to compete for attention.\nWith Se-In High drawing the public’s gaze like a sturdy breakwater, it made it easier for Ahseong High Student Council President Han Baek-hyun to suppress information from spreading online.\nSpecifically, the information that Ahn Woo-jin, the Disciplinary Committee Chief, had awakened spatial abilities.\nOf course, it was impossible to completely prevent information leaks, but this level of containment was commendable.\nThe plan was to protect that information until Ahn Woo-jin was strong enough to protect himself and his comrades.\n“Excuse me for saying this, but is it really alright for you to go to such lengths for the Chief?”\nOne day, when the secretary asked this, Student Council President Baek-hyun replied offhandedly while handling paperwork.\n“This Disciplinary Committee Chief is exceptional. I need to protect him for the sake of my achievements. At least while he’s the Chief.”\n“But if you’re going as far as opposing the Federation Council… wouldn’t that be risky…?”\n“And I can’t stand anyone messing with my people, whether it’s Ahn Woo-jin or you.”\nBaek-hyun’s eyes blazed as he pointed to the gleaming Student Council President badge pinned to his shirt collar.\n“That’s the weight of this badge, as I see it. This is a matter that comes before any of my achievements.”\n“Are you sure about this?”\n“There’s no way I can be sure. I can only hope that Ahn Woo-jin handles the situation properly.”\nBaek-hyun silently pleaded to Woo-jin, ‘Please, I’m counting on you.’\nThe Ahseong High Disciplinary Committee gathered the new recruits for a celebratory meal.\nThey were all dressed in black uniforms with Disciplinary Committee armbands on their left arms, filling the room.\nAmidst them, Kim Yeon-hee quietly picked up and ate a chicken drumstick with a hand gloved in plastic.\nThe noise from the new recruits was loud enough to be bothersome, but she didn’t mind. The real issue was the boys who occasionally approached her.\n“Hi, I don’t think I’ve seen you before.”\nA slick-looking boy sat next to Yeon-hee and started talking. He exuded a clear desire for romance.\nHe was already the fifth one.\n“What’s your name?” “…Chicken.” “Chicken?” “Do you prefer the tender meat like drumsticks and wings, or the dry meat like breast?” “Huh? What all of a sudden?”\nThe boy glanced at the drumstick in Yeon-hee’s hand and gave a knowing smile. The drumstick had tender meat.\n“I prefer tender meat….” “Then go away. The tender meat is mine.” “?”\nThe boy was caught off guard, failing to follow the context of the conversation, but soon realized.\n‘I made a mistake…!’\nHe felt like a job applicant who had just given the wrong answer in an interview.\n“No, don’t misunderstand. I wasn’t trying to steal your food….” “I don’t share meals with people who have the same chicken preferences as me. Didn’t you hear me? Go away.” “……”\nThere was a chilling aura in Yeon-hee’s pink eyes behind her round glasses.\n“Uh, uh… enjoy your meal.”\nWorried that an argument might break out, the boy hastily left, looking embarrassed. He then started telling his friends, “What’s up with her?”\nHis friends discussed his rejection by Kim Yeon-hee, which soon turned into a deep debate.\n“It’s not right for both the guy and the girl to like tender meat. If you order a whole chicken, it’ll cause problems.” “No, no. If they both like tender meat, they can just order a combo. It’s actually beneficial.” “But combos are more expensive.” “Then we should discuss which brand offers the best value.”\nIt was the kind of debate you’d find in a language arts textbook.\nYeon-hee ignored them and continued eating her chicken.\nThen, suddenly, a conversation caught her attention.\n“Honestly, I came here just to see the Chief! He’s handsome, charismatic, and has taken down those infamous villains…! He’s like the main character in a comic! I can’t believe someone like him exists!” “Yeah, the Chief is amazing…. I almost had a heart attack when I walked past him once. He’s so cool…!”\nThe boys around them shivered, brushing off the goosebumps on their arms, but…\n‘Are they talking about Woo-jin?’\nYeon-hee leaned in closer, trying to listen to the girls’ conversation.\nIt was an involuntary reaction.\n“I wasn’t really interested at first, but then I saw him fight against Shin So-rang.” “Oh, you mean the Swordsman of Sindorim?” “Yeah. That’s when I became a fan!” “Eek!”\n“Becoming a fan” was a term that meant falling for someone’s charm, often used in reference to celebrities.\nThe girls burst into giggles, while the boys around them shook their heads and moved away.\n“So, about the Chief…! Huh?” “?”\nBefore she knew it, Yeon-hee had unwittingly approached the girls who were talking about Ahn Woo-jin.\nThe girls stopped talking and stared at Yeon-hee.\n“Ah.”\nYeon-hee realized what she had done and let out a gasp.\n“Do you have something to say?” “How did I…?” “No need to explain! You were drawn to our talk about the Chief, right?”\nThe girls laughed again. It was because of the Disciplinary Committee armband on Yeon-hee’s arm.\nA sense of belonging tends to easily break down barriers of caution.\nYeon-hee was startled and waved her arms.\n“No, I was just…!” “It’s okay! Come join us!”\nJust as the girl next to her was about to link arms and pull Yeon-hee closer—\nThud!\n“Huh?”\nYeon-hee instinctively shook her arm free.\nThe girls were taken aback by her sensitive reaction.\nAn awkward silence fell among them.\n“Uh, um…?” “This is…”\nYeon-hee tried to come up with an excuse, but quickly got up and attempted to leave the gathering.\nAs she reached the exit, the door opened before her.\n“Hmm~. I smell something fresh…. I have a feeling my future boyfriend is here!” “Relationships are banned at our school.” “I’m not talking about dating, Baek-seo. I’m talking about engagement! …Huh?”\nYeon-hee stopped in her tracks, startled.\nIn front of her stood a tall boy. When she looked up, she saw a familiar face.\nTeal-colored eyes.\nIt was Ahn Woo-jin.\nBehind Woo-jin were Vice Chief Oh Baek-seo and Executive Ha Ye-song. They were also looking at Yeon-hee.\n“?”\nWoo-jin looked at her curiously.\n“Ah!”\nSuddenly flustered, Yeon-hee hastily saluted and then quickly brushed past Woo-jin and hurried away.\n“She seems like a new recruit. Maybe she urgently needed the bathroom?” “The bathroom is inside, though?”\nYe-song and Baek-seo exchanged thoughts.\nThey watched Yeon-hee descend the stairs with puzzled expressions.\n“Chief, I’ll go after her.” “No, stay here.”\nAs Baek-seo spoke in a slightly faster tone and tried to move, Woo-jin stopped her.\n“I actually have something I’m curious to ask her.”\nThe Chief of the Disciplinary Committee making an appearance at the welcome party for new recruits was a sort of tradition.\nIt wasn’t a formal rule, more like an established custom.\nThat said, there wasn’t much to do.\nThe Chief would briefly talk about the mindset that Disciplinary Committee members should have, offer a toast to welcome them, enjoy a bit of food, and then leave. After that, I’d go back to my work.\nSince it wasn’t burdensome, I decided to follow Kim Yeon-hee, who had just left. Among the new recruits, she was the one I was most curious about.\n[Ha Ye-song: Chief] [Ha Ye-song: I talked to the others] [Ha Ye-song: They said they tried to include her in their conversation, but she suddenly shook them off and ran out] [Ha Ye-song: The girls are confused, not knowing what they did wrong] [Ha Ye-song: They said they’re sorry if they did something wrong] [Ha Ye-song: Tell her when you see her!] [Ha Ye-song: Oh] [Ha Ye-song: I’ll just go eat some chicken] [Ha Ye-song: I’ll be eating chicken]\nIt seemed like Ye-song got excited when the freshly fried chicken arrived, as her Koko Talk messages became more hurried.\nAfter confirming the direction Kim Yeon-hee had gone, I predicted her path and lightly used spatial leap.\n‘Might as well make an impression.’\nThen I leaned against the wall, crossing my arms. Since I had an image to uphold, I had to strike a pose like this to create the right atmosphere in front of the new recruits.\n“Huh…!”\nYeon-hee, who had been walking quickly, was startled as soon as she saw me.\n“Where are you going?” “Why is the Chief here…?”\nBecause you’re acting suspicious.\n“You’re now part of the Disciplinary Committee. You’re one of my people. Of course, I’m going to be concerned.”\nI responded with a statement that was both logical and somewhat romantic.\nIf it had been anyone else leaving, I wouldn’t have paid any attention.\nLeaving the welcome party whenever they want is their freedom.\nEven the Disciplinary Committee isn’t strict about such things.\n“Were you bored with the welcome party? It hasn’t been long since it started.” “That’s not it, but…”\nI took a step closer.\nAs I did, Yeon-hee stepped back.\n“?”\nWhat’s going on?\nAnother step.\nIt was like we were repelling each other, and the distance between us wasn’t closing.\n“Why are you avoiding me?” “Why are you approaching me?” “To talk.” “I, I don’t have anything to say…!”\n“……”\nMy eyes narrowed. Now my curiosity was piqued.\nI quickly walked toward Yeon-hee.\n“Ah! Don’t come any closer…! Ah!”\nThud!\nYeon-hee stumbled backward, tripping over a low structure, and fell on her bottom.\n“Ugh….”\nShe hadn’t enhanced her body with magic, so it looked like it hurt quite a bit.\n‘She’s reacting as if she’s being chased by a stalker….’\nYeon-hee’s round glasses had fallen to the ground. I picked them up and handed them back to her.\nWhether it was a professional instinct or not, I quickly examined the glasses for anything suspicious. They were just ordinary glasses.\n“Are you okay?” “……!”\nYeon-hee stopped groaning in pain and looked at me with wide, surprised eyes.\n“Th-thank you…!”\nShe snatched the glasses and quickly put them back on, standing up hurriedly.\nHer face was flushed, clearly embarrassed.\nJudging by her posture, it seemed she was ready to bolt from the spot.\nWhat is this?\nI stared at Yeon-hee, then closed my eyes and sighed.\n“Tell me why you’re avoiding me.”\nI opened my eyes again and looked at her calmly.\nHer clumsy behavior was raising all kinds of questions.\nIt was like the reaction of someone who had no experience in love encountering their crush for the first time.\nNo…, it felt a little different from that.\nMore precisely, it was as if she couldn’t calm herself down and was trying to avoid the cause of her agitation.\n“Kim Yeon-hee.”\nI pretended to look at her name tag on her uniform, then said her name as I approached.\nThat made Yeon-hee retreat even further.\n“I-I’m sorry!!” “Wait…!?”\nLike a third-rate villain making a hasty exit, she turned and ran away.\nShe sprinted off so fast that dust kicked up behind her.\n“?”\nWhat in the world…?\nI was puzzled for a moment.\nAside from my suspicion about Kim Yeon-hee, I was now deeply curious about why she was avoiding me.\n“……”\nSeveral theories came to mind, but it was hard to draw a clear conclusion.\nThis was something I needed to resolve quickly.\nIt seemed I would be seeing a lot more of Yeon-hee in the near future.\n“This is driving me crazy….”\nKim Yeon-hee cautiously checked to make sure Ahn Woo-jin wasn’t following her as she hurried home.\nA long sigh escaped her.\nShe immediately spun a spinner to undo her disguise.\nIn an instant, her original appearance returned—Kim Dal-bi.\n“Haa.”\nDal-bi pressed her hand to her forehead, trying to cool the heat rising in her head.\nWithout a doubt, Woo-jin was Dal-bi’s weakness.\nShe hadn’t realized it until now, but facing Woo-jin in everyday situations was more overwhelming than she had imagined. It was like a tsunami of awe and excitement crashing over her all at once.\nMoreover, considering that Woo-jin and Dal-bi had spent their childhoods closely together, there was a chance he could recognize the habits ingrained in her, even if he didn’t possess Baek-seo’s level of insight.\nThis made her even more cautious.\nOn top of that, the urgency of not wanting to be discovered, combined with the intense excitement, made it impossible for her to keep her composure.\nDal-bi had already decided that Baek-seo, not herself, should be the one by Woo-jin’s side.\nThe complex gears of emotion interlocked, and in the end, Dal-bi’s legs chose to flee.\n“Was I always this foolish…?”\nDal-bi was disappointed in herself.",

      "content": "\"Hey.\"\nWhoosh.\n\"......\"\nWhenever I tried to approach Kim Yeon-hee, she would quickly change direction and hurry away.\nShe seemed to somehow sense my gaze and immediately flee. As a result, the only way to observe her was from a distance.\nIt appeared that she was managing her Disciplinary Committee duties well. However, other members didn't seem to be particularly fond of her.\n─ \"Kim Yeon-hee, she seems gentle, but there's something scary about her. You know those eyes that remind you of a psychopath? It's like that... Maybe I'm being too harsh?\"\nAs her school records indicated, her social skills were probably lacking.\nEven if I considered Yeon-hee as a spy sent by the Principal, it seemed unlikely that she'd be this clumsy. It's especially noticeable in comparison to the precedent set by Han Seo-jin.\nDisciplinary Committee Executive Office.\nI was standing still, gazing out the window when I happened to spot Yeon-hee, who was on patrol duty.\n\"Chief, are you thinking naughty thoughts?\"\n\"You always say that whenever I'm quiet, even for a moment.\"\nWhen I continued watching Yeon-hee, Baek-seo fell silent. I could sense her gaze, like she was staring at me from behind.\nSoon enough.\n\"......!\"\nBaek-seo approached from behind and rested her chin on my shoulder, standing on tiptoe.\nThe gentle fragrance tickled my nose, and the soft sensation against my back made me instinctively tense up.\nThere was no hesitation in her physical contact.\n\"Wait...?\"\n\"Why won't you look at me?\"\n\"We're in the office, you know...?\"\nBaek-seo's slender fingers slid between mine, teasing as if she might interlace them, only to pull away and repeat the motion.\n\"Right now, there's no one here except us.\"\nHer seductive whisper brushed against my ear.\nNow she's being blatantly obvious in her attempts to tempt me.\n\"That may be true, but we're still in the office.... If someone happens to look this way, we could be caught...\"\n\"And yet, you're not pushing me away. Your body is being honest, isn't it?\"\nOf course... I'm only human, and it's hard to resist.\n\"...I won't deny it.\"\n\"Good, I like that honesty.\"\nAs if rewarding me, Baek-seo fully interlaced her fingers with mine.\n\"But Chief, who were you watching?\"\nBaek-seo's question implied that she already knew I had been looking at someone.\nSpending so much time with her, it's no surprise she's developed such keen awareness. With Baek-seo, it feels like she knows everything.\n'I can't even have a stray thought.'\nAll my attention was focused on the soft voice in my ear and the warm sensation on my back.\nIn the end, I had no choice but to turn my head. When I did, Baek-seo's smiling face filled my vision, so close I could feel her warm breath.\n\"I just happened to see some of the new recruits passing by.\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"......\"\n\"......\"\nAs if we had agreed beforehand, we silently observed each other for a moment.\nThen, out of nowhere, Baek-seo closed her eyes with a playful smile. I was taken aback.\n\"Why are you closing your eyes?\"\n\"Just getting ready.\"\nShe was clearly anticipating a kiss.\nBut does a kiss really require preparation?\nBaek-seo tilted her head, urging me to get on with it.\nI had never placed much importance on dating or romantic gestures, so naturally, I had never experienced a first kiss.\nIt felt strange to be having my first kiss in such an abrupt manner.\nYet, before I knew it, my body had already turned towards Baek-seo. Despite my hesitation, I found myself leaning closer to her.\n‘This kind of mood isn’t so bad….’\nAt that moment.\nBaek-seo suddenly pulled back, and I instinctively created some distance between us.\nBang!\n\"Wild Ha Ye-song has arrived!\"\n\"Come on in.\"\nYe-song had appeared.\nSuddenly, there was a noticeable gap between us. I quickly composed myself and turned to face Ye-song, my heart still pounding from the close encounter.\n\"Welcome...\"\n\"Chief, what’s wrong? Did something happen?\"\n\"Nothing... happened...\"\n\"?\"\nYe-song looked puzzled and glanced at Baek-seo, who was still smiling warmly.\nSuspicion flickered in Ye-song’s eyes, but then she suddenly seemed to remember something.\n\"Hey! A new bibimbap place just opened today! They’re having a grand opening, so we should hurry before the line gets too long! Follow me!\"\nYe-song’s eyes sparkled as she turned and beckoned us to follow.\nIt was just around lunchtime.\nI exchanged a glance with Baek-seo.\n\"Shall we?\"\nBaek-seo led the way, and I followed close behind.\n\"......\"\n\"Hey, are you alright?\"\nWhile on patrol duty, Kim Yeon-hee suddenly stopped and lowered her head. Her fellow Disciplinary Committee member, who was on duty with her, noticed something was wrong and asked, but Yeon-hee remained silent for a while.\nA chilling aura seemed to radiate from her, sending shivers down her colleague's spine and causing them to break out in a cold sweat.\n‘What’s this feeling?’\nThere was no way her fellow student could recognize the killing intent that only someone of the upper ranks, at level six or above, could emit.\nFinally, Yeon-hee took a deep breath, lifted her head, and awkwardly smiled.\n\"...It's nothing. I just had a bad thought for a moment.\"\n\"Oh, do you have some kind of trauma?\"\n\"Yeah, something like that.\"\n\"I understand. It’s okay, it’s okay….\"\nAs her colleague tried to pat her back reassuringly, Yeon-hee turned away to avoid the touch.\n\"Oh.\"\nAn awkward silence followed as Yeon-hee realized her mistake. She smiled awkwardly.\n\"Sorry... I'm still not comfortable with things like this.\"\n\"No, I’m sorry. I won’t touch you anymore.\"\nThe fellow student nodded in understanding and withdrew their hand, assuming that Yeon-hee avoided human contact due to some untold trauma.\nThe two resumed their patrol.\nYeon-hee turned her eyes to glance at the building where the Disciplinary Committee’s office was located.\nUntil just a moment ago, she had been watching Ahn Woo-jin and Oh Baek-seo from afar, observing their intimate moment.\nThey seemed to have left the area, perhaps for lunch.\n\"......\"\nYeon-hee lowered her gaze.\nA sharp pain pierced her heart.\nLately, Kim Dal-bi’s daily life had become repetitive, like a hamster wheel.\nShe would attend school, manage her Disciplinary Committee duties, and then head home.\nAt 11 PM every night, she would report on the activities of Disciplinary Committee Chief Ahn Woo-jin and Oh Baek-seo.\nShe hadn’t been given any new orders as one of the Six Sinners. Perhaps they intended for her to focus on her role as a spy within the Ahseong High Disciplinary Committee.\nMoreover, Dal-bi reported information that seemed useful on the surface but was actually of little practical value. After all, she was on Woo-jin and Baek-seo's side.\n\"That’s the end of my report.\"\nIn the dimly lit room.\nDal-bi finished her report and sat at her desk. A small picture frame lay face down.\nShe closed her eyes. The scene she had witnessed through the window, Woo-jin and Baek-seo’s intimate moment, kept replaying in her mind.\n\"Haa.\"\nWith a sigh, she opened her eyes again.\nBaek-seo was the one who should be by Woo-jin’s side. Together, they would unite to oppose the Principal.\nDal-bi just needed to stick to her plan and execute it at the right time. For now, she had to set aside her lingering feelings for Woo-jin.\nBut it seemed it would take some time to do that.\n‘It would have been better if I didn’t have to see him.’\nDal-bi slumped over her desk and used her fingers to right the small picture frame. Inside the frame was a photo of young Dal-bi and Woo-jin, both smiling innocently.\nIt would be easier to let go of her feelings if she didn’t have to see Woo-jin.\nIn her current situation, where she constantly ran into him, Dal-bi felt both happiness and heartache.\nAfter all, if she had no intention of making important reports, what was the point of this mission to spy on Woo-jin and Baek-seo?\nAnd yet.\n\"Why on earth….\"\nDal-bi found herself revisiting a long-held question.\n‘Why did the old woman give me this mission?’\nThe Principal was well aware that Woo-jin was extremely important to Dal-bi.\nHer dementia hadn’t progressed to the point where she couldn’t remember that Woo-jin was Dal-bi’s weak spot.\nAnd yet, the Principal had assigned her to spy on Woo-jin.\nWas it a test to see if she would remain loyal or switch sides?\nProbably not. It was obvious that Dal-bi would side with Woo-jin.\nThen was it because there was no one else to take on the task?\nThat didn’t seem likely either.\nBefore Han Seo-jin’s mission failed, the Principal had instructed Dal-bi to use Platinum Mileage to purchase FC303, the absolute disguise magic tool, in the first semester.\nShe had likely planned to give Dal-bi this mission from the start.\nStill, there was no definitive proof.\nGiven the Principal’s dementia, any explanation could seem plausible.\n‘What’s the purpose…?’\nShe couldn’t be sure, but she had a bad feeling about it.\nHowever, whatever the problem might be, it didn’t matter. Assigning Dal-bi to be with Baek-seo would turn out to be a mistake.\nAfter all, Dal-bi planned to bring down the Principal with Baek-seo.\nDusk was falling.\nKim Yeon-hee was on her way home after completing her Disciplinary Committee duties. She was alone.\nAs she passed through a tunnel with a stream flowing below, she stopped to feel the cool breeze and gaze at the water. Then she lightly jumped onto the railing and began walking along it.\nShe did it just because she felt like it.\nThe wind felt good. The thrill was exhilarating. The view of the stream below, reflecting the city lights, had a certain aesthetic appeal.\nA small smile formed on Yeon-hee's lips as she balanced and walked along the railing.\nThen.\n\"Huh?\"\nYeon-hee sensed someone watching her and looked up. A man sitting on the railing, near the road, came into view.\nHer eyes widened in surprise.\n\"What are you doing up there, so dangerously?\"\n\"Woo-jin...! Ch-Chief!?\"\nIt was Ahn Woo-jin.\n\"I have a question. Why do you keep avoiding me...?\"\n\"Aah!\"\nStartled, Yeon-hee lost her balance and toppled over the railing. She fell straight into the stream below.\n\"How foolish...!\"\nCrack!\nWoo-jin quickly created a spatial rift and leaped into the stream.\nSplash!\nYeon-hee had already fallen into the water.\nIt was dark around the stream. It was dangerous.\nWoo-jin grabbed Yeon-hee before she could sink deeper.\nYeon-hee, who was already seasoned in combat, wasn’t particularly alarmed by falling into the stream.\nHowever, being held in Woo-jin's arms in the cold water... that made her whole body freeze up.\nWhen she looked up, she could see Woo-jin's face, drenched with water. It was a moment she couldn’t believe was happening.\nTo Yeon-hee, that moment felt like an eternity.\n\"Huff!\"\nWoo-jin, enhancing his body with magic, held Yeon-hee tightly and swam towards the shore.\nOnce there, he laid Yeon-hee down, and she began coughing up the water that had entered her lungs.\nRelieved, Woo-jin caught his breath and then glared at Yeon-hee in frustration.\n\"What were you thinking? Why were you on the railing...? And as a member of the Disciplinary Committee, how could you be so careless?\"\nWoo-jin's voice was stern.\n\"I'm sorry... I was careless... I just wanted to do it for a moment....\"\nYeon-hee apologized, still breathing heavily.\n\"Because of me, you're cold and wet... I didn’t mean for this to happen....\"\n\"......\"\nHearing the tremor in her voice, Woo-jin noticed the guilt weighing on her and decided not to scold her further.\n\"...Are you alright?\"\n\"Yes, I'm fine....\"\n\"Then that’s good.\"\n\"But Chief, how did you reach me so quickly...?\"\n\"I enhanced my body with magic and jumped in.\"\nWoo-jin chose to keep the spatial leap a secret.\n\"Achoo...!\"\nAs Yeon-hee took off her glasses and repeatedly sneezed while sitting up, Woo-jin took off his jacket and shook it out towards the stream.\n\"Ah.\"\nThen, Woo-jin pulled a talisman out of his jacket pocket and wiped the water off it.\nIt was a coated talisman with a peony flower on it.\nSeeing the talisman, Yeon-hee lowered her head.\n\"Chief, is that...?\"\n\"This? Why?\"\n\"You seemed concerned about it first, so it looked important....\"\nYeon-hee was asking what the talisman was.\nShe knew what it was. She was the one who had given it to Woo-jin.\nAfter a brief hesitation, Woo-jin answered.\n\"It’s... something like a lucky charm. It’s special.\"\n\"Special?\"\n\"Because it was given to me by someone precious.\"\n\"Even you have someone precious, Chief?\"\n\"What do you take me for?\"\nWoo-jin shot a sharp look at Yeon-hee.\nYeon-hee quickly waved her arms in denial.\n\"No, it’s just... You usually have such a cold demeanor....\"\n\"I do have feelings, you know.\"\n\"Really...?\"\nSomeone precious. That single phrase sank deeply into Yeon-hee's heart.\nHer lips curled up into a smile despite herself.\n\"Hm?\"\nYeon-hee stood up and approached Woo-jin. She cupped her hands as if she were scooping something.\nWhoosh.\nA small flame ignited in her hands.\n‘Will-o'-the-wisp.’\nA pink flame that matched the color of her eyes.\nYeon-hee’s original elemental magic produced red flames. But in this situation, producing red flames would be akin to revealing her identity, as magical energy colors match eye color.\nHowever, Yeon-hee could produce will-o'-the-wisps in various colors, a power derived from her connection to the spirits. This ability was the key to hiding her true identity for so long.\nThe beautiful light from the flame spread out, illuminating the darkened area around the stream.\nWoo-jin remained still. His wet body seemed to welcome the warm, comforting light from the flame.\n\"......?\"\nThe expression on Yeon-hee’s face, illuminated by the flame, appeared to be a forced smile, masking complicated emotions.\nFor some reason, Woo-jin saw a resemblance to young Dal-bi in her expression.\nIt was similar to the look Dal-bi sometimes wore.\n\"I thought it might help dry us off.\"\nBetween the two of them, the peony talisman caught the light from the flame.\n\"And... I'm sorry. Because of me.\"\n\"...It's alright. As long as you're safe.\"\nLingering attachments suffocate people. And they distance people from their rationality.\nYeon-hee smiled faintly.\nTears welled up in her eyes. Luckily, she was already wet from the water.",

      "content": "No matter how important the work, a break is necessary.\nPark Min-hyuk firmly believed that \"good work efficiency comes from good rest.\"\n[A, MH2000-nim~. Thank you for the donation! You think the new skin is pretty? Eh, glad you like it!]\nThat's why he often sat quietly watching \"virtual streamer\" broadcasts on his laptop.\nA virtual streamer is a streamer who broadcasts while using a character skin to represent themselves.\nInside the dark cabinet of the Disciplinary Committee office, the voice of the virtual streamer flowing through his earphones melted into Min-hyuk's heart.\n\"Hehe...\"\nEven his laughter became soft and relaxed.\nMH2000 was Min-hyuk's username.\nHe couldn't resist donating because the streamer would always react to donation messages.\nAmong the sea of viewers, catching her attention through chat alone was nearly impossible.\nSo, being able to interact with a girl with such a sweet voice through donations brought Min-hyuk immense satisfaction.\nBefore long, the virtual streamer started playing a game.\n‘Oh…!’\nWhen a game Min-hyuk liked appeared, he decided to postpone his work.\nAt that moment...\nClick! Whoosh!\nThe cabinet door swung open, and the light from the outside world flooded into the dark space.\n\"Ahh!\"\nMin-hyuk jumped in shock and quickly slammed his laptop shut.\nOutside the cabinet, a female student stood with the light from the overhead lamps casting a shadow, glaring at Min-hyuk with sharp eyes.\nIt was Ha Ye-song.\n\"Min-hyuk-ssi, what are you doing, giggling alone in the dark? Watching something naughty?\"\n\"W-What are you talking about…! I was just taking a break….\"\n\"Confiscated!\"\nSnatch!\nYe-song swiftly snatched Min-hyuk's laptop. The earphones popped out of his ears and dangled from the laptop.\n\"Hey! What are you doing!?\"\nMin-hyuk jumped out of the cabinet, chasing after Ye-song to get his laptop back. But there was no way he could overpower her.\n\"I have to check what you were secretly watching in the sacred office space! As the one in charge of maintaining decency, I must see it with my own eyes!\"\n\"Since when have you been so diligent!? Give it back!\"\nYe-song turned her back to him and opened the laptop, her eyes scanning the screen.\nHer eyes widened.\n\"This is...! Chief, look at this!\"\n\"What is it?\"\nAhn Woo-jin, who had been working with Oh Baek-seo, looked at Ye-song with a puzzled expression.\nYe-song giggled, her eyes gleaming as if she had found a new toy.\nNext to her, Min-hyuk was fidgeting nervously, sweat running down his face. Now that Woo-jin was interested, he couldn’t resist any longer.\nYe-song placed Min-hyuk's laptop on Woo-jin's desk and pulled out the earphones. Woo-jin and Baek-seo looked at the screen.\n‘What’s the fuss about?’\nOn the laptop that Ha Ye-song placed on my desk, a live broadcast was playing. I watched the screen closely.\n[Kyaaah…! What should I do, what should I do!? What should I do!?]\n\"...A V-tuber?\"\nA \"V-tuber\" is a term for a virtual streamer active on G-tube.\n\"Is this a horror game?\"\nThe V-tuber on the screen was screaming vividly as she was chased by a grotesque toy in a horror game. The louder her screams grew, the more sweat trickled down Park Min-hyuk’s face.\n“Explanation time!”\nYe-song raised her index finger and switched into explanation mode.\n“That V-tuber is ‘Iaring’! She’s been blowing up recently.”\n“How do you know that?”\nMin-hyuk interjected.\n“These days, all the otakus are watching it, you know? My role requires me to be aware of trends in various fields, right? So even if I didn’t want to know, I couldn’t help but know. She has over a million subscribers; how could I not know?”\nMin-hyuk seemed surprised by Ye-song’s unexpected knowledge of otaku culture.\n“Iaring… I think I’ve heard of her too.”\n“See? Even the Chief knows. That says a lot.”\nIt was hard not to know about her, given that she had recently risen rapidly in the G-tube rankings.\nThough, I wasn’t sure if “recently” was the right term, as I knew she had been around for a while.\nShe had been unnoticed until one day when she suddenly caught a wave and rode it well.\n[No, no! Kyaaah!]\n“!”\nIn the end, the character the V-tuber was playing got caught by the toy monster, leading to a game over. I found myself involuntarily flinching.\n‘Wow, that startled me….’\nI almost let out a scream. That was close.\nThe chat was flooded with “ㅋㅋㅋ” laughter.\n“This game looks fun. Should I try it later?”\nBaek-seo showed interest.\n“You like horror games?”\n“I don’t particularly like them, but it looks fun, doesn’t it?”\nBaek-seo smiled meaningfully, her gaze predatory like a snake eyeing its prey.\n…Could she have noticed that I was startled?\n‘She’s definitely planning to make me play this with her….’\nShe probably wanted to see if I could keep a straight face even in front of a horror game. I could see right through her insidious intentions.\nA sudden tension gripped me. Would I survive this?\n“Um, that’s not the reaction I was hoping for?”\nYe-song seemed frustrated, pointing at the V-tuber on the screen.\n“Park Min-hyuk was watching Iaring’s stream alone, you know? While we’re all busy working late into the night without going home! And he’s sitting there in the dark, laughing to himself!”\n“Dark and creepy, huh….”\n“Sitting alone in a dark cabinet, curled up with earphones in, watching a V-tuber stream and giggling—isn’t that the definition of creepy?”\n“Ugh, I can’t argue with that….”\nMin-hyuk trembled.\nMeanwhile, Yoo Do-ha, who had been lying on the sofa looking over some documents, didn’t seem interested in joining the conversation.\nHonestly, like Do-ha, I didn’t really want to get involved in this situation either.\nLet’s just move on.\n“Well, it could be seen as Min-hyuk’s way of taking a break. Since there’s a lot of work, taking a short break is fine. I only care about the results, so you all manage your work and don’t pry into each other’s personal lives.”\n“Chief…!”\nMin-hyuk looked at me with teary-eyed gratitude, while Ye-song squinted her eyes, as if to say, “You’re making sense….”\nThe V-tuber’s voice continued to fill the room.\n“Here.”\n“Th-Thank you….”\nAs I handed the laptop back to Min-hyuk.\n[Phew… I survived…! That was scary… Let’s take a quick break, ha…. Oh? Wow~, Galbi-rib-nim! Thank you for the 10,000 won donation!]\nThe V-tuber had reached a safe zone after surviving the toy monster and was taking a moment to catch her breath.\nThen, an unexpected comment slipped out of her mouth.\n[Huh? You’re asking if there’s someone I think of when I’m scared…? I think of the Disciplinary Committee Chief of Ahseong High.]\nFreeze.\nFor a brief moment, time seemed to stop in the room.\nBaek-seo’s gaze snapped sharply toward the laptop.\nYe-song’s eyes widened in surprise.\nSuddenly, Do-ha sat up on the sofa and looked at the laptop with a puzzled expression.\nMin-hyuk and I froze in place, as if we could read each other’s thoughts.\nWhat… was that?\n“Um…. Why is the Chief’s name coming up here?”\nBaek-seo’s measured voice pierced my eardrums.\n‘Why is my name being mentioned out of nowhere…?’\nI felt the same way.\nThe chat was suddenly flooded with question marks.\nThe V-tuber, realizing she had made a slip of the tongue due to the excitement of the horror game, exclaimed, “Ah, ah!” in a panicked voice.\n[Ah, well! He saved me once. I was in a really scary situation once, you know? It was terrifying back then. But when the Disciplinary Committee Chief showed up, I felt so reassured! I guess that’s why I think of him when I’m scared. Someday, I hope I can repay the favor.]\nIt was a heartwarming story.\nBut for some reason, the looks from the officers around me were rather significant.\nWere they thinking I had been flirting?\nBut seriously.\n‘Could it be someone I saved…? I can’t recognize the voice, though.’\nI couldn’t pinpoint who Iaring was.\nHearing her voice didn’t bring anyone to mind, which meant she probably wasn’t someone particularly significant in my memory.\nAs part of the Disciplinary Committee, I naturally saved a lot of people. I couldn’t possibly remember each and every one of them.\n[Do I like him, you say!? W-What are you talking about…! That would be rude to him! Do you know what kind of person he is! Don’t say things like that! Anyway, let’s continue now that I’ve rested…!]\n“I see….”\nMin-hyuk, now holding the laptop, gently stroked the screen where Iaring’s face was. His eyes reflected a mix of sadness and longing.\n“I guess girls like Iaring already have their own princes….”\nThis was a new situation for me, so I wasn’t sure how to react.\nSigh.\nA hand suddenly landed on my shoulder. It was Baek-seo.\n“Hehe, she’s someone who knows gratitude. Aren’t you lucky, Chief? So popular.”\n“No, that’s not…”\nShe’s smiling, right…?\n“You know.”\nBaek-seo leaned in and whispered in my ear, so softly that it was almost inaudible.\n“Don’t forget that you’re mine.”\nHer whisper sent a shiver down my spine.\n‘Of course….’\nBut somehow, hearing Baek-seo honestly express her feelings made me feel much better than before.\nDo-ha muttered “Iaring…” under her breath as she started fiddling with her smartphone, and Ye-song stroked her chin, deep in thought.\n“If she was saved by the Chief, then Iaring must at least live within our school’s jurisdiction…. Chief, should I track her down and introduce you? Or should I threaten her, saying she’s not good enough for our Chief!?”\n“Why on earth would you do that…?”\n“Heh, it sounds fun.”\n“Don’t do anything unnecessary, whichever it is.”\nBehind me, Baek-seo was still standing with her hand on my shoulder. Even though she wasn’t exerting any pressure, the sense of pressure was overwhelming.\nYe-song was spouting nonsense, Min-hyuk was moping, and Do-ha was losing focus….\nI needed to change the subject quickly.\n“Speaking of which.”\nSeeing the V-tuber reminded me of someone.\n“What’s Shin-dong-lim Sword Master up to these days?”\nShin-dong-lim Sword Master. He was also a G-tube content creator, a publicity seeker who disappeared after having a duel with me.\nI hadn’t paid him any mind since then. But now, I was curious.\n“Ah, Shin-so? He seems to have started a new account and is somehow surviving. Last I heard, the rule about confiscating his earnings was brought to the Constitutional Court for review.”\nYe-song answered.\n“You used to call him your top boyfriend candidate, but now your reaction is pretty indifferent.”\n“The number one candidate for Ha Ye-song’s boyfriend is currently vacant. Shin-so doesn’t even make it into the top ten now. He’s a loser, not worthy of my attention.”\nWhy is she so full of herself without knowing the other person’s feelings?\n‘So she has a top ten list….’\nIt was such useless information, and I regretted that it automatically got stored in my memory.\n“Oh, right. Did you know Shin-so posted an apology video?”\n“An apology video?”\n“Yes, apologizing to the Chief. He said he caused too much trouble. It’s been up for a while, but I forgot about it…. Want to see it?”\nI nodded, and Ye-song showed me the video that Shin-dong-lim Sword Master had uploaded.\nIn a serious tone, while wearing his mask, Shin-so looked into the camera and apologized, saying, \"I apologize to the Ahseong High Disciplinary Committee Chief.”\nHe mentioned that upon reflection, he realized how much trouble he had caused and felt guilty.\n“Well, it’s probably just for appearances. A guy making a decent living from G-tube had his image tank after messing with you. Even though it was a hot topic, it was a huge hassle, wasn’t it?”\n“But you seemed to enjoy it back then?”\n“That’s because it’s comedy from a distance. If it’s fun, that’s all that matters to me!”\nAs the video neared its end, Shin-so said,\n[Sometime, I hope I can repay the debt I owe to the Chief of the Ahseong High Disciplinary Committee.]\n‘This feels somehow….’\nThe people I’ve saved. The people I’ve fought with.\n‘This is interesting.’\nThe process of forming new relationships with them… was quite intriguing.\n“Goodbye~.”\nMin Hana waved at her computer monitor.\n“Goodbye” had become shortened to “Jiba” on G-tube, meaning the same as “bye.”\n“Haaah…”\nHana turned off the broadcast and slumped back in her chair. A deep sigh escaped her.\n“I misspoke. I got too excited….”\nAs a virtual streamer, her real appearance was hidden behind her skin.\nAnd due to the excitement from the horror game, she accidentally mentioned the Ahseong High Disciplinary Committee Chief, who had been occupying her thoughts.\nOnce she had said it, she couldn’t take it back, and she regretted it immediately after.\nShe worried that she might have caused trouble for Woo-jin.\nHana recalled the time when Woo-jin had taken down Han So-jeong’s gang, who had been bullying her. Even though Woo-jin probably didn’t remember her, he had become someone very important to her.\nIt was easy to see why the students respected him so much.\n‘Thanks to him… I’ve gained so much.’\nShe no longer had to live in fear.\nGradually, Hana had grown as a virtual streamer, and now she was a popular broadcaster.\n‘Someday… if there’s a way I can help.’\nTo Hana, Woo-jin was a benefactor.\nSo, from now on, Hana would be on Woo-jin’s side.\nMeanwhile.\nWhoosh whoosh!\nPark Sung-tae, the male student once known as the Shin-dong-lim Sword Master, was relentlessly swinging his sword in the training ground.\n“Huff, huff…!”\nHe was training like a madman, over and over.\nAfter feeling the overwhelming power of Ahn Woo-jin firsthand, despite being on the same level, Sung-tae couldn’t allow himself to stay still.\n‘At least… if I could even reach the Chief’s heels…!’\nHe desperately wanted to get stronger.\nWoo-jin had crushed Sung-tae’s pride to the point where he was driven to the brink of madness.\nBut instead of succumbing to despair, Sung-tae found himself feeling grateful.\nHe had come to fully realize how weak and insignificant his skills were, and it allowed him to face the truth about himself.\nHe acknowledged that he was selfish and petty. And he accepted that about himself.\nSo now, he decided to live as someone who pursued his own gain.\nClinging to the defeat that Woo-jin had handed him.\n‘Someday, I’ll restore my image…!’\nThe price for causing such a disturbance and forcing the Ahseong High Disciplinary Committee Chief to intervene couldn’t be repaid with just an apology video.\nJust as the creases in folded paper never fully disappear.\nSo, he would pretend to be repentant while helping others like the Disciplinary Committee did. To do that, he needed to get stronger. And in the process, he could work on restoring his image.\nOpportunity favors the prepared.\nSung-tae swung his sword, dreaming of rising again as the Shin-dong-lim Sword Master.\nWaiting for the breakfast that Oh Baek-seo was preparing, Ahn Woo-jin received a phone call.\n─ Woo-jin, it’s me.\nAs Woo-jin listened to the call, his expression gradually hardened. Baek-seo, sensing that something was wrong, glanced at him.\nClick.\nWoo-jin listened silently to the conversation before ending the call. Uncharacteristically, he seemed dazed, causing Baek-seo to ask, puzzled.\n“Chief, did something happen?”\n“Master….”\nWoo-jin’s pupils quivered. As if he couldn’t believe it, a hollow laugh escaped him.\n“They say he… passed away?”",

      "content": "─ \"Why do you want me to teach you so badly?\" ─ \"Because I know you're strong.\"\nMy master, Kim Man-seok, was someone who stood between the old humanity and the new humanity. Specifically, he belonged to the old humanity.\nHe was one of the survivors from the rapid changes during the \"Canaan\" project, where humanity built cities on the lands blessed by the Golden Lamb.\nIf he were still alive, he would be over 50 years old by now.\nMost people in a situation similar to my master's became explorers. Just as heroes are born in times of chaos, they threw themselves into the outside world. Was it out of a sense of duty?\nNo, it probably wasn't just for such romantic reasons. Most likely, they harbored deep resentment toward the monsters roaming the outside world.\nUnlike the new humanity, who were born in the lands blessed by the Golden Lamb and enjoyed relatively safe lives, the old humanity had likely lost loved ones like family, friends, and comrades to the monsters.\nThey might have been enraged simply because they had been shown an unfair hell.\nThat's why they couldn't let go of the outside world.\nMy master lost his son to a monster's fangs. Because of that, he spent most of his life fighting monsters.\nI recalled the original story and remembered the time when Kim Man-seok would briefly return to the city. I waited at the place where he was expected to come and met him. Afterward, I asked him to take me as his disciple.\nIt was a time when I was still deeply affected by the shock of losing Kim Dal-bi, so I remember being quite persistent.\nKim Man-seok refused at first. However, I kept following him and asking, and eventually, he changed his mind and decided to teach me.\nI don't know what made him change his mind. No matter how much I asked, he always repeated that his heart just changed.\nLater, he mentioned that I reminded him of his son, so maybe he saw his son's image in me.\nMy master, with his extensive experience in actual combat, favored a combat-oriented training method, and he didn't go easy on me just because I was young.\nAnd since he was also at the 6th rank, his teaching was more than sufficient.\nThus, I endured the horribly difficult and painful times.\n─ \"Woo-jin.\"\nOne night, under a starry sky.\nMy master and I were sitting by a campfire, having a barbecue party with cultivated meat.\nI was happily eating, wondering why we were having meat, when my master placed his hand on my head and smiled.\n─ \"You'll probably become unbelievably strong. Strong enough that someone like me won't even compare.\" ─ \"I know. I can already tell that my mana is refined to that extent.\"\nBack then, I was confident, believing that the results of repeatedly practicing mana cultivation since childhood would soon become evident.\nIt was only later, when I hit the wall of the 5th rank, that I started to consider myself ordinary.\n─ \"Haha, this kid's really unlucky, a perfect target for a beating.\" ─ \"Where are you going?\" ─ \"Where would I go, leaving you behind?\"\nBefore dawn the next day, my master quietly left my side without a word.\nUnlike with Dal-bi, I had already suspected that my master would leave. He had been talking about his son more often than usual, which was unlike him.\nIf the old wounds in his heart had resurfaced, it was easy to predict that he would head outside the city.\nBut on that day, I was in a daze all day.\nSaying goodbye to someone dear is always hard to get used to.\n\"…….\"\nIn the midst of white chrysanthemum flowers was a young portrait of my master, as I remembered him. Baek-seo and I attended the funeral dressed in black, bowed, and lit incense.\nSince most citizens didn't have parents, the role of the chief mourner was usually taken by someone who was like family or an AI robot.\nIn my master's case, his comrade, Song Do-il, became the chief mourner. Do-il was someone I often encountered during my time as a disciple.\nHe was also the one who informed me of my master's death. Despite being around the same age as my master, he looked like an old man with white hair.\nIt seemed that living a life filled with constant battles, resentment, and stress in the outside world had aged him quickly.\n‘Bandages…’\nUnlike what I remembered, Do-il had a bandage wrapped around his left eye. It looked like he had recently suffered an injury to his left eye.\n\"May the deceased rest in peace.\"\nBaek-seo and I expressed our condolences and bowed our heads.\nFor a while, my eyes were fixed on the portrait.\nI spent some time in a daze.\nBaek-seo quietly waited for me.\nAlthough I knew from the original story when my master, Kim Man-seok, would come to Neo Seoul, I hadn't expected him to leave this quickly.\nMeanwhile, there weren't many people having a meal. Only a few elderly people.\nThey were part of the old humanity, who had chosen to spend their peaceful old age in the city. They had come to see my master one last time.\n“I expected only Woo-jin to come, but there’s a girl with him too.”\nBaek-seo and I sat side by side at the table, and Song Do-il sat across from us, striking up a conversation. I could feel the gazes of the other old humanity members.\nEven though he had lost a comrade he had lived with for decades, Do-il didn't seem particularly sad. He even smiled with a sense of ease.\nHowever, his eyes were dark, as if he hadn't slept for several days.\nBaek-seo greeted him with a kind smile.\n\"I'm the Deputy Chief of Ahseong High's Disciplinary Committee. I'm here to support the Chief, and when I heard about his master's passing, I accompanied him.\"\n\"Well, aren't you a sharp one.\"\nDo-il nodded in approval and then looked at me.\n“Woo-jin, the Chief of Ahseong High's Disciplinary Committee? You've grown well in our absence. But that kind of position must be tough. A lot of responsibility comes with it, right?”\n“It’s tough, but not as tough as what you've been through.”\n“Is that so? I wouldn’t know; I don’t have any responsibilities. Ah, Woo-jin, hold on a second.”\nDo-il gestured for me to come closer. He seemed to have something private to say. When I approached him, he put his arm around my shoulder and turned me away from Baek-seo.\nDo-il whispered playfully.\n“You've even got a pretty girlfriend now. Life’s good, huh?”\n“Does it look that way?”\n“Of course. Congratulations, man.”\n“Yeah, well. Thank you.”\nDo-il was a warm-hearted person.\nI recalled how, when I was training under my master, Do-il would often come by and make sudden dad jokes. Maybe it was because of the tough training, but they were quite funny.\nEven now, it was clear that he was trying to be considerate of my feelings.\n‘You're probably the one who’s the most hurt.’\nDo-il was likely the one who carried my master back.\nHe must have endured a hellish time crossing the monster-infested outside world to return to the city with my master, who was probably in a terrible state or already dead.\nThere was no way his mind could be okay.\n‘Who’s comforting who?’\nSo, I decided to be considerate of him as well.\n“What were you two talking about…?”\n“Nothing?”\nWhen Baek-seo asked, Do-il played innocent.\nI returned to sit next to Baek-seo.\n“So, what happened to the master…?”\n“There was no specific cause of death. That idiot just pushed himself too hard, not even realizing the gap between himself and his opponent. That’s why I ended up like this too.”\nDo-il casually pointed to his bandaged left eye.\n“Well, it was inevitable. But considering how long we've lived, we've had a good run!”\nI recalled that the retrieval rate of explorers' corpses was 0.09%, according to the latest report. Even that was in cases where comrades happened to bring the bodies back, so in reality, it was almost impossible to retrieve them.\nSince the survival rate wasn’t high either, they couldn’t tell if an explorer was dead or alive, so they had a system of renewing licenses every ten years.\nIf an explorer couldn’t renew their license, they had a three-year grace period.\nAfter those three years, they were declared missing and presumed dead.\nThe day I first met my master was also the day he came to renew his license.\n“What rank are you now?”\n“Around the 6th rank.”\n“Kyaa, I knew it. Woo-jin, you’re a genius. I’ve never seen anyone with mana as pure as yours!”\nWe talked about our recent lives and memories of my master.\nIf it weren’t for the funeral, it would’ve been like a normal conversation between people who hadn’t seen each other in a while.\nEven though we knew what emotions we were all feeling, we pretended not to, creating a ridiculous situation where we were all trying to be considerate of each other.\n“He really… was an unlucky bastard.”\nAs Do-il reminisced about the past, a young couple entered the mourning hall.\nThe boy had slicked-back fiery red hair.\nWearing sunglasses and walking confidently with a smile, the male student strutted around like a delinquent with his hands in his pockets.\nFollowing behind him was a girl with sky-blue twin-tail hair and a cold expression.\n“Who are they? Hold on.”\nDo-il quickly returned to the mourning hall. However, he didn’t seem to recognize the couple.\n“……?”\nI had never seen these students before either.\nWere they people connected to my master that I didn’t know about?\nThey just stood there, staring at my master’s portrait, not even offering a bow. Were they Protestants?\n‘No…. What’s this?’\nThey didn’t even bow their heads.\nThe boy, in particular, stood still, staring at the portrait, and then glanced at Do-il.\nHe sneered, as if mocking him.\nFor a moment, I wondered if I had seen wrong because his disdain was so blatant.\nDo-il seemed to have the same feeling; he looked bewildered before his expression hardened.\n“Who are you?”\n“We just heard that Kim Man-seok passed away, so we thought we’d come and see. I guess this old man finally bit the dust.”\n“……?”\nThe boy pushed his sunglasses up onto his forehead and smirked. He seemed to be mocking them.\n“Ah, yukgaejang! Let’s go eat yukgaejang.”\n“Okay.”\nThey headed to the dining area, briefly glancing at Baek-seo and me as they passed.\nThe atmosphere turned tense, the tension palpable. Baek-seo seemed displeased as well.\nThe old humanity mourners were casting sharp glances at the new arrivals. There was a palpable sense of hostility in their stares.\nBut either they were oblivious, or they simply didn’t care, as the boy continued to eat his yukgaejang happily.\nHe was eating with such gusto, it was like he was filming a mukbang.\n“Kya, this is why I love funeral food! Hey, can I get another bowl?”\nThe boy cheerfully lifted his bowl of yukgaejang towards the staff. The girl quietly chewed on the bossam.\nDo-il stared at them, looking dumbfounded.\nEven the staff member working at the event was sweating bullets, sensing the tension.\nThe room was filled with a heavy silence.\nThe staff brought another bowl of yukgaejang, and the boy cheerfully accepted it, taking in his surroundings.\n“Hmm?”\nThe boy noticed that all the mourners were glaring at him with hostility.\nThe boy’s smirk turned into a scowl, and a vein popped on his forehead.\nHe snapped irritably.\n“What are you looking at, you bastards?”\nA blatant provocation.\n“How dare you, young punk, say such things here!”\nOne of the mourners shouted, and the boy’s lips curled into a smirk.\n“I wanted to see this bastard die too, okay? I came here for my own reasons. You think you’re the only ones with feelings? I came here to deal with mine, so mind your own business.”\nScreech!\n“Oh?”\nIn an instant, Do-il moved swiftly and placed a knife to the boy’s neck. The boy was startled at first but then grinned in amusement.\n“Brother, you’re being noisy, so shut up.”\n“Oh, right, sorry?”\nThe boy responded softly to the girl’s scolding. They didn’t seem to care that Do-il had drawn a knife.\n“Who the hell are you two? What was your relationship with Man-seok?”\nDo-il asked in a menacing tone, and the boy hesitated before answering.\n“Not much? Just someone we knew.”\n“……?”\n“Kim Man-seok… He was that old guy who used to criticize Neo Seoul’s system, right? He was pretty famous.”\nThere are several problems with the Neo Seoul system.\nLike the issues I experienced in the factory when I was a child, where human rights were blatantly disregarded despite being enshrined in the Constitution.\nSuch criticisms were always brought up, and my master was one of the people who consistently voiced such concerns.\nAs a strong figure among the old humanity, my master’s opinions carried weight.\n“He was just an old man with a big mouth. He pissed me off, that guy. And now he’s dead, just like that? I thought it would be interesting to come and see for myself.”\nThe boy pointed to the portrait with his spoon.\nThe mourners’ faces twisted in anger.\n“This city has advanced so much for the good of humanity! But that old man had no clue what he was talking about, isn’t that funny!?”\n“Brother, you’re being loud….”\nBefore I knew it, my body had moved.\nThud. I grabbed the boy by the back of his head.\n“Huh? Oomph!”\nBang!!\nI slammed the boy’s head down hard.\nHis head plunged into the yukgaejang, smashing the table and crashing into the floor. A scream burst out from him.\nI lifted his head again and slammed it down once more.\nBang!!\n“Have you said everything you wanted to say?”\nMy voice was tinged with coldness, even though my emotions had already cooled.\nThe girl, presumably his sister, quietly chewed on her bossam while glancing at her brother and me.\n“Kyaa! This guy’s making things fun…!”\nDespite the pain, the boy twisted his head around, ripping at his scalp. He had considerable strength.\n“What’s your deal?”\nThe boy asked, his face soaked in yukgaejang broth and covered in bits of meat, grinning with a twisted smile. Veins bulged on his face as he expressed his anger.\nLuckily, he seemed fully intent on resisting.\nMy rationality was already wearing thin.\n“I’m with the Disciplinary Committee. I’m detaining you for defamation, public disturbance, and obstruction of business.”\nIf he was so intent on provoking me, I was more than willing to oblige.",

      "content": "\"Gasp...!\"\nKim Dal-bi woke up suddenly, overwhelmed by a strong sensation.\nShe bolted upright, panting heavily. The nightmare she had just experienced lingered like an afterimage in her mind.\nIn the dream, An Woo-jin shrank and climbed onto a dining table. In front of him was the Glutton, Hong Gyu, who licked his lips, holding a knife in one hand and a fork in the other.\nThe knife cut Woo-jin like a steak, but Dal-bi was powerless to do anything.\nThat was the dream.\n\"What kind of dream is this...?\"\n[Dal-bi! Dal-bi!]\nAt that moment, a small goblin with red skin appeared as if it had been waiting for her to wake up. Dal-bi broke out in a cold sweat at the goblin’s frantic behavior.\nA sense of unease welled up inside her.\n\"What are you? Did you cause this dream?\"\nThe trembling in Dal-bi’s voice made the goblin nod cautiously.\n[I don’t know the exact content of the dream, but yes, I caused it.]\n\"Why?\"\n[The Glutton... Hong Gyu has activated his ultimate magic formula, targeting An Woo-jin. I detected an anomaly in the mark inscribed on An Woo-jin.]\nDal-bi’s heart sank, and her pupils quivered.\n\"What are you saying...? That was supposed to be used against Goliath... No, this doesn’t make sense! Why would he use something like that on Woo-jin? Did the Principal order this? Why didn’t I know Hong Gyu would do something like this!?\"\n[I think the Principal was aware of your presence and deliberately kept you in the dark.]\nEverything was so confusing that Dal-bi couldn’t make sense of what was happening.\n\"Then I...\"\nShe hesitated, looking out the window with a troubled expression.\nShe wanted to rush to Woo-jin’s side and save him immediately.\nBut Woo-jin had Oh Baek-seo with him.\nBaek-seo could protect Woo-jin.\n\"Where’s Baek-seo? What’s she doing?\"\n[I’m not sure. We’re trying to locate her.]\nDal-bi bit her lower lip.\nShe had vowed not to interfere in their lives anymore.\nBut hearing that the Glutton had targeted Woo-jin with his ultimate magic formula, while Baek-seo’s whereabouts were unknown, made it impossible for her to sit still.\nClick, click.\nDal-bi swiftly armed herself in the attire of the Sixth Sinner Goblin and asked in a chilling tone,\n\"Where’s Woo-jin?\"\n[He’s presumed to be in the Zero Zone. But it’s impossible to enter.]\n\"Of course.\"\n[What will you do?]\nWith a resolute gaze, Dal-bi donned the goblin mask over her face.\n\"I’m going to save Woo-jin.\"\nFor the last time, just this once.\nDal-bi resolved to interfere in Woo-jin’s life once more.\nIn an instant, my consciousness faltered.\nI couldn’t comprehend what had hit me. Suddenly, the ground beneath me liquefied, and my body was sucked downwards, giving me a sinking feeling.\nIt all happened so abruptly while I was taking a break from interrogating Moon Chae-yeon and getting some fresh air.\n\"Hey.\"\nSlap, slap.\nI felt someone lightly slapping my cheeks.\nMy consciousness returned, and as I opened my eyes, I saw someone standing before me.\nThe first thing I noticed was a strange mask covering half of the person’s face.\nThe mask was shaped like a distorted face, with a wide mouth and protruding teeth.\nThe part of the face not covered by the mask was entirely red, with only a mouth—no other facial features—like a faceless ghost.\nThis was the effect of the mask.\nBehind the red figure were bizarre structures and pillars made of magic, lined up like an eerie altar.\nMy mind wasn’t working clearly.\nJust moments ago, I was at Ahseong High, but now I had no idea where I was… I couldn’t immediately figure it out.\nHowever...\n“Hall Monitor, you’re finally awake?”\nA distorted voice.\nI knew very well who this monster was.\n‘I can’t… move.’\nI was kneeling on both knees, with my limbs bound.\nI didn’t think I could break free. The chains made of incredibly dense magic were binding me tightly.\nI couldn’t move my body at all. It felt as if I had lost control over most of my physical functions.\nOn top of that...\n‘I’m being drained of magic... I can’t even use it.’\nMagic was being drained from my entire body at an alarming rate. I couldn’t use my magic at all; it didn’t even feel like my own anymore.\nHad I lost control over my magic? It seemed like even Geumyang wouldn’t be able to emerge in this state.\nBehind me, I heard a continuous gurgling sound, like someone licking their lips with a mouthful of saliva. It felt as though a gigantic creature was present.\nMy magic was being absorbed by that entity through the magical chains.\nI couldn’t even think of trying to teleport out. I was helplessly having my magic drained away.\n‘This is... ah.’\nAs my senses returned to normal, my eyes widened.\nHow could I not recognize this situation?\n‘The Glutton’s ultimate magic formula...!’\nThe context was clear.\nWhy on earth had the Glutton used his ultimate magic formula, meant for Goliath, on me?\nThis must have been a trump card for the Principal as well.\nIt didn’t feel real, but I had to keep my wits about me. I needed to assess the situation.\n“Are you so shocked that you can’t speak...?”\nThe masked man grabbed my hair and spoke, as if seeking my attention.\nFear and frustration boiled up inside me. I narrowed my eyes and glared at the masked man.\n“...Who are you?”\nI knew who he was.\nI was pretending not to know on purpose.\nI knew this bastard had a strong sense of pride.\n“Huh?”\nAs expected, the masked man’s mouth twisted into a sneer.\nWhip!\n“Gah!”\nThe masked man yanked my hair upward.\n“Do you not recognize me, even though you’re the Hall Monitor?”\n“You should show your face properly if you want people to know who you are. How would I know the identity of the ‘Glutton’?”\n“What, so you do know?”\nThe masked man’s elongated mouth curved into a sinister smile.\n“We’ve met before, haven’t we?”\nThe masked man removed his mask.\nBlinking, I saw his true face revealed.\nRed, slicked-back hair. A cocky smile on an arrogant face.\n“We met before, didn’t we? We had a good time, didn’t we?”\nHe was Hong Gyu, one of the Six Sinners, the Glutton.\n“Yeah... so it was you.”\n“Oh, did I give it away?”\n“I had my suspicions, even without proof.”\n“Impressive. You’ve got sharp instincts, fitting for a Hall Monitor. I’m genuinely impressed. I really respect that kind of ability.”\n“This doesn’t seem like the kind of treatment you’d give someone you respect.”\n“That’s different.”\nHong Gyu grinned and leaned closer to me.\n“No… Showing you this ability is the highest honor I could bestow upon you.”\nHong Gyu released my hair and stepped back, spreading his arms wide as he laughed maniacally.\n“Behold, Hall Monitor! This is the pinnacle of my power, the feast offered to the gods! ‘Heavenly Ritual Feast (Cheonsangjeryeumhyang)’!”\nThe area around us was filled with overwhelming magic.\nNow I could see it.\nThe entire scene of the city was clearly visible.\nEven in the darkness of the night, the desolate cityscape was unmistakable.\nIt was the view of the ‘Zero Zone.’\nAnd...\n“This place has now become the banquet of the God of Gluttony.”\nThe unique ability ‘God of Gluttony.’\nThe ultimate technique.\nThe magic formula of the sixth type, ‘Heavenly Ritual Feast (Cheonsangjeryeumhyang).’\nThough Hong Gyu’s showy behavior made it seem like boasting, the Heavenly Ritual Feast was an extremely dangerous magic formula.\nIt forcibly teleports the target onto the dining table of the God of Gluttony, who then devours their magic.\nThe caster must satisfy the God of Gluttony; otherwise, they will be devoured themselves. But it seemed the God of Gluttony was thoroughly enjoying the taste of my magic.\n‘Don’t turn around. If you do, your head will be crushed.’\nI had to use every bit of knowledge I had.\nThe Glutton’s ultimate magic formula could only be activated once in his lifetime. It was his ultimate move.\nIn the original story, the Heavenly Ritual Feast wasn’t a magic formula used against the protagonist, Lee Tae-sung.\nThe target was none other than Neo Seoul’s strongest, Goliath.\nEven Goliath, a formidable powerhouse, had a hard time dealing with this powerful magic formula.\nGoliath only managed to escape because he was extraordinarily strong, but there was no way I could resist the Heavenly Ritual Feast in my current state.\n“For the record, you shouldn’t turn around. You’ll regret it.”\nHong Gyu warned me with a smile.\nI looked around at the dark red magic of the God of Gluttony surrounding me. There were irregularly gaping mouths in the structures.\nIf I looked up, I could see the barrier surrounding the Zero Zone. Since the God of Gluttony’s feast shouldn’t be interrupted, the Heavenly Ritual Feast deployed a very strong barrier.\nOnly Hong Gyu’s allies would have the authority to enter that barrier.\nThe Heavenly Ritual Feast could only be activated if the target’s location was known. His sister must have been in charge of finding the target.\nSo, she wasn’t in the Zero Zone right now.\nHong Gyu must have adjusted the barrier’s restrictions to allow his sister to enter at any time.\nIt was a flexible barrier.\n‘It’s similar to what happened with Han Seo-jin, but this one is stronger and more systematic.’\nOf course, it would be.\nThis barrier was powered by the God of Gluttony, an unknown entity.\nI almost wanted to laugh out loud.\n‘I have to stall for time, no matter what.’\nThere was no way I could break free from this situation.\n‘At this rate, I’m bound to be half-dead at best.’\nTime was not on my side.\nIf my magic were to be completely drained, the God of Gluttony would start savoring my mind next.\nIt was dangerous.\nHong Gyu seemed relaxed, likely because he knew this as well.\nAll I could do was hope that before Hong Gyu or the God of Gluttony killed me, someone like Baek-seo or the Hall Monitors would notice the situation and find a way to save me.\n“Yeah... my magic is draining at an insane rate. Why would you use such an amazing ability on someone like me?”\nNo matter how I looked at it, using a technique meant for Goliath on me was unexpected.\nThough I was bewildered, I managed to maintain a hostile expression as I asked.\n“Is the Principal really that wary of me?”\n“Khehehe, you knew it. Did Oh Baek-seo or Moon Chae-yeon spill the beans? Those girls, they have no sense of security or loyalty. Instead of sacrificing themselves for the Principal, who works so hard for Neo Seoul, they act like unruly animals, baring their teeth everywhere. They don’t understand the honor of it all. They lack discernment.”\nHong Gyu grumbled.\n“Who would’ve thought I’d meet a fanatic for the Principal? You’re a lunatic.”\nI hadn’t expected the Glutton to hold such a worldview.\nHe was no different from someone who believed in a cult.\nWham!\n“Gah!”\nSuddenly, Hong Gyu kicked me in the head. The impact was strong enough to make my head ring.\nI couldn’t strengthen my body because I couldn’t use any magic. Even though Hong Gyu seemed to have controlled his strength, the impact was so severe that I felt like my consciousness might slip away.\nBlood trickled down from my head, dripping onto the floor as I lowered my head.\nHong Gyu crouched down, glaring at me with cold eyes.\n“Hall Monitor. You’re nothing to the Principal. You’re just a rat scurrying around, stirring up space. You should be grateful. You’re lucky to have such a good ability that it’s useful to the Principal.”\nI see.\nNow I understand.\n“So the Principal plans to take my ability.”\nI already knew that the Principal had the power to steal unique abilities.\nAnd I, like Goliath, was blessed with the power of the Golden Ram.\nSince targeting Goliath was too risky, it seemed they had decided to make me the target instead.\nI raised my head and glared at Hong Gyu.\n“Is that even possible? To steal and bestow abilities... Is that the Principal’s unique ability?”\nIt didn’t make sense for Moon Chae-yeon’s technique to steal unique abilities.\nIf the Principal’s unique ability was something of that nature...\nThen I could roughly understand how they had planned to steal Oh Baek-seo’s ability.\nAnd if Hong Gyu was a devotee of the Principal, it was possible that the Principal had revealed a lot of information to him.\n“Huh?”\nHong Gyu frowned and chuckled. As expected, he seemed to know the answer to my question.\n“It’s similar, but you’re mistaken.”\n“Mistaken…?”\nIt’s similar to the concept of stealing and bestowing abilities, but different?\nHong Gyu pointed upwards.\n“The Principal’s unique ability is of a higher dimension. It’s not something a lowly creature like you can even begin to guess at.”\nHong Gyu spoke cryptically, a vein bulging on his forehead.\nIt seemed he was annoyed that I had even attempted to guess the nature of the Principal’s unique ability. Perhaps he believed that as a devotee of the Principal, he was inherently superior.\n‘Arrogant bastard…’\nIt was then.\nMy eyes narrowed. I felt as if all the magic available to me had been absorbed.\nThe glow of the magical chains that bound me also dimmed. Had the transfer of magic been completed?\n“All absorbed. The God of Gluttony says your magic had an excellent flavor.”\nHong Gyu laughed, a sneer on his face.\n‘My magic...’\nMy magic had finally been depleted.\nHong Gyu grabbed my head and, with wide eyes and a smile, whispered,\n“Next is your mind. The ‘Higher Being’ seems to enjoy that sort of thing. Soon, you’ll become a vegetable. After that, I’ll thoroughly suck every last bit of your unique ability and drain you of every drop of your essence. You should feel honored. The Principal has a use for you.”\nIt felt as if something parasitic was crawling inside me, making its way into my head.\nThe God of Gluttony, having drained my magic, was now trying to consume my mind.\nI gritted my teeth. I didn’t have the strength to resist. But I struggled, writhing in agony.\nBut no matter how much I thrashed, the magical chains only tightened around me, leaving me completely helpless.\n“You’re going to a better place. Now, let’s have a glorious end.”\nHong Gyu patted my shoulder as he spoke.\nI couldn’t let it end like this.\nI couldn’t die like this.\nMy eyes were bloodshot. I tried to muster every ounce of strength I had left.\nI knew it was too late to hope for a miracle, but I didn’t want to accept death quietly.\n“Like a worm, wriggling even when it’s stepped on? I’m telling you, it’s useless!”\nHong Gyu, seemingly excited, burst into laughter.\n“Grrr…”\nThe pain was excruciating.\nI didn’t know what I looked like, but it was clear that blood was flowing from various parts of my body. It was because the God of Gluttony’s magic was burrowing into me.\nI must have looked quite gruesome.\nSuddenly, I remembered the sight of Oh Baek-seo in Moon Chae-yeon’s hideout. The image of her having her unique ability drained was still vividly etched in my mind, appearing whenever I closed my eyes.\nIf I looked honestly at myself, I would know that I was feeling an unbearable rage.\nIf I didn’t release this anger, I would carry it with me to the grave.\n“You bastards...”\nI knew I was crying tears of blood. Still, I glared at Hong Gyu and spoke.\n“I will…”\nI will send you all to the depths of despair, even if it costs me my life.\nI couldn’t speak anymore. Blood gushed out of my mouth. My mind grew hazy, and Hong Gyu continued to laugh mockingly.\nAs my eyes slowly began to close.\nAt that moment.\nFwoosh!!!\n[─────!!!]\nSuddenly, brilliant flames erupted, accompanied by a monstrous scream that pierced my ears.\nThe God of Gluttony’s magic stopped crawling up my body and began to recede, escaping from me like smoke. The God of Gluttony seemed to be caught off guard by the unexpected flames.\nThese weren’t ordinary flames.\nThey belonged to someone with immense magical power.\nHong Gyu jumped up in shock, spinning around to face the source of the fiery magic.\nI panted heavily, turning to look in the direction Hong Gyu was staring.\n“This...!”\nA vein bulged on Hong Gyu’s forehead. His twisted smile turned toward a woman wearing a goblin mask.\n“Kim Dal-bi…!”\nScreech.\nThe gleaming blade in the goblin-masked woman’s hand reflected the light emitted by the God of Gluttony’s magic.\nThe one who had interfered with the Heavenly Ritual Feast.\nShe was Kim Dal-bi, one of the Six Sinners.",

      "content": "'Dal-bi...?'\nIt was difficult to process the shock. I could only stare wide-eyed, locking eyes with Dal-bi.\nHer once vibrant eyes, now dull, were fixed on Hong Gyu. As she raised her sword, Hong Gyu let out a short laugh and began walking toward her.\n‘There’s a barrier here… No, did this bastard accept Dal-bi as an ally...? What’s going on...?’\nOne thing was clear—the barrier had allowed Dal-bi to enter.\nWas it because Hong Gyu had considered her an ally? The exact reason was unclear.\n“Hah… so this is how it ends.”\nHong Gyu scratched his head nervously, though the corners of his mouth twitched as if he was suppressing a laugh.\n“I shouldn’t have set the barrier’s access to the Zero Zone... The problem is, I can’t change it now.”\n“Why don’t you blame the Principal? He’s the one who gave those instructions,” Dal-bi’s voice echoed from within her mask.\nHong Gyu’s expression hardened.\n“You insolent little... How dare you not add ‘Sir’ when speaking of the Principal?”\nSuddenly, the numerous mouths attached to the magical structures that formed the Heavenly Ritual Feast opened wide and spat out something.\nEach was a monstrous figure bathed in a dark red, mystical hue, an otherworldly being with a gaping maw.\nThese were the derived forms of the Heavenly Ritual Feast—the Army of Gluttony.\nAnyone who attempted to disrupt the God of Gluttony’s feast had to face the Army of Gluttony.\nHong Gyu shoved his hands into the pockets of his coat, a grin spreading across his veiny face.\n“You’ve always annoyed me. It pissed me off how you dared to defy the Principal, not knowing your place.”\n“......”\n“But I’m grateful. Thanks for coming here to die.”\nHong Gyu raised his arm.\n“Let’s settle this once and for all.”\nThen he swiftly brought it down.\nWhoosh!\nThe Army of Gluttony charged at Dal-bi all at once.\nTheir movements were swift. Judging by the sheer amount of magic power they emitted, even a powerful 7th-tier mage would struggle to take them on.\nHowever, Dal-bi showed no sign of retreat.\nFwoosh!\nFlames erupted around Dal-bi, spreading out widely. Then, from within the expanding fire, numerous goblins brandishing clubs sprang forth.\n[Graaaaah!!]\nThe unique ability, ‘Goblin Lord.’\nMagic formula, Type 1: ‘Goblin Summon.’\nThe goblins roared in unison as they charged against the Army of Gluttony.\nA fierce battle ensued, but the goblins were no match for the God of Gluttony’s army.\nThe monstrous soldiers grotesquely widened their jaws, devouring the goblins. The goblins were overwhelmed and fell one after another.\nThese creatures were not born from Hong Gyu’s power alone. They were the manifestation of the God of Gluttony, an entity far beyond human understanding.\nDal-bi was outmatched.\nYet her eyes remained unwavering.\nWhish!\nDal-bi fiercely threw her sword at Hong Gyu.\nAs a child, Kim Dal-bi had been full of laughter.\nWhenever she closed her eyes, the pain from the past resurfaced. Magic would engulf her body, and the sensation of needles piercing every part of her constantly tormented her.\nBut Dal-bi would smile.\nBecause smiling helped lessen the pain.\nDal-bi believed that her choice was the right one. After all, when she smiled brightly while with Oh Baek-seo, they became close friends.\nDal-bi was lonely.\nSo Baek-seo became an invaluable friend to her.\nWhen Baek-seo and Dal-bi were torn apart by the Principal’s manipulations, Dal-bi’s heart felt like it was being ripped apart.\nThe pain in her heart, different from the physical pain, constantly gnawed at her.\nThat was something she could hardly bear, but Dal-bi forced herself to smile again, enduring the sense of loss.\nAfter arriving at a new place, she lived through grueling training under the Principal’s orders. Then, one winter day, Dal-bi discovered a field covered in white snow.\nThe barren trees were adorned with snow flowers, and the entirely white landscape was so beautiful that it drew Dal-bi in.\nWhen she exhaled, her breath came out in white puffs, like the snow flowers. Snowflakes drifted down gently from the gray sky.\nBundled up in winter clothes, Dal-bi left footprints in the snow. She was happy. But when she turned around and saw only her own footprints, her expression would often fall.\nShe wished she could have walked that path with Baek-seo.\n“Hey!”\nAt that moment, a voice caught Dal-bi’s attention.\nShe came face to face with a boy, around her age.\nDue to the deep snow, he waddled clumsily toward her, occasionally stumbling as he struggled to reach her.\nHe seemed determined. There was even a hint of desperation in his expression.\nCurious about this, Dal-bi waited quietly for him to approach, feeling a bit dazed.\nEventually, the boy stood in front of Dal-bi.\n“Who are you!?”\nIt wasn’t an aggressive question. His voice was just high-pitched, likely due to nervousness.\nDal-bi flinched but continued to stare blankly at the boy. His pale green eyes, framed by thin eyelids, were quite beautiful.\n“…Who are you?”\n“I’m An Woo-jin.”\nThe boy revealed his name.\n“I’m Kim… Eun-ha.”\nDal-bi started to say her name but remembered that she shouldn’t and instead blurted out the first fake name that came to mind.\n“But why…? Do you have something to say?”\n“No… I don’t.”\n“?”\nWoo-jin answered with a serious yet awkward expression, sounding resolute.\n“I just wanted to talk to you.”\nDal-bi couldn’t understand Woo-jin’s answer.\n“Why?”\n“Just because.”\n“What do you mean, just because?”\n“I don’t know how to explain it…”\n“…Suspicious!”\n“Wait, I’m not a suspicious person…! Huh?”\nWoo-jin hastily tried to deny it, but then he stopped. Dal-bi was giggling.\nDal-bi smiled brightly.\n“Your name is An Woo-jin?”\n“Yeah.”\n“I was bored! You talked to me, so you’re responsible now!”\n“Huh?”\nDal-bi grabbed Woo-jin’s gloved hand with her own and started walking ahead. Woo-jin had no choice but to follow.\nThen.\n“Whoa!”\n“Oof!”\nThud!\nDue to the heavy snow, the two children lost their balance and fell forward. They both ended up buried in the snow but soon lifted their heads.\nThe two children exchanged blank stares.\nSnow clung to their hair, and their faces had turned red from the cold snow.\nWoo-jin looked a bit dazed, and Dal-bi chuckled. Then she burst into laughter.\n“Hahaha!!”\nWoo-jin awkwardly scratched his head and smiled.\nTo Dal-bi, this was a precious memory she would never forget.\nFwoosh!\nThe sword Dal-bi had thrown ignited into flames, spinning like a boomerang and slicing through the snowy, happy past.\nIt was a sight like a wheel of bright flames rotating.\nThe target was Hong Gyu.\nNo matter how formidable the Heavenly Ritual Feast was, if the caster was taken down, it would be nullified and disappear.\nBut it was no use.\nClang!\nHong Gyu pulled out a massive axe and swung it, deflecting the incoming sword. It was a remarkably effortless response.\nWhoosh!\nAs if she had anticipated it, Dal-bi pushed off the ground without showing any sign of surprise.\nIn her eyes, she could see Woo-jin, his face bloodied and in disarray. He was bound, becoming prey for the massive, grotesque creature, the God of Gluttony, behind him.\nDal-bi couldn’t stand it. Inside her goblin mask, she bit her lower lip hard, drawing blood.\nAt this moment, she was willing to pay any price to protect Woo-jin.\nFwoosh!\nRed and blue flames, filled with immense magic power, wrapped around Dal-bi’s body like bands.\nTwo bright flames emerged from her forehead, casting a mysterious light, and fire rose from her hands, forming into the shape of clubs.\nHer eyes shone with two different colors, one blue and the other red, like twin flames. They were the colors of goblin magic.\nHer hair and skin glowed brightly, as if the saturation had been turned up. A trail of brilliant flames followed her movements, lighting up the darkness of the night.\nThe unique ability, Goblin Lord.\nMagic formula, Type 3: ‘Goblinization.’\nDal-bi unleashed her true power.\n“……!”\nHong Gyu felt a chill run down his spine. A rough smile soon spread across his face.\nHe shouted excitedly.\n“Yes! Hahaha!! Finally showing your true strength, Kim Dal-bi!!”\nDal-bi swung her club toward the Army of Gluttony.\nBoom!\nFwoosh!\nWith one strike, a soldier of Gluttony shattered, and the contrasting flames exploded, consuming everything in their path.\nThe concentration of magic within the flames was overwhelming.\nThe power of Dal-bi, now goblinized, combined with her talent, created an unimaginable destructive force.\nHowever, the cost was horrific.\n“Ah…!”\nDal-bi let out a gasp.\n‘Crash,’ like a glass window shattering, something broke in her mind.\nBut Dal-bi couldn’t stop.\nAs she swung her club again, more soldiers of Gluttony were destroyed.\nEach time, something broke inside her mind, making it impossible to distinguish its form.\nWhat was already broken transformed into an abstract form, scattering within her mind.\nDal-bi gritted her teeth.\nShe couldn’t stop now, no matter what the cost.\nThe true power of the Goblin Lord’s unique ability began with Goblinization.\nIt granted Dal-bi immense power, on par with a 7th-tier mage.\nBut there was one price to pay.\nHer ‘precious memories.’\nThat was the penalty of the Goblin Lord’s unique ability.\nWith each swing of her club, Dal-bi lost a memory.\nDal-bi howled like a beast. She screamed so fiercely that it felt like she was letting go of everything inside her.\nBoom!\nA thunderous explosion echoed.\nThe memories of the flowers and letters Woo-jin had given her shattered.\nBoom!\nThe memories of visiting Woo-jin’s house and cooking for him shattered.\nBoom!\nThe memories of gifting Woo-jin a robot toy, which he had liked, shattered.\nBoom!\nThe memories of Woo-jin repeatedly telling her that he liked her shattered.\nBoom!\nThe memories of hugging Woo-jin frequently shattered.\nBoom!\nThe memories of talking about the future while gazing at the city’s skyline with Woo-jin shattered.\nBoom…!\nThe memories of gifting Woo-jin peonies shattered.\nBoom….\nAs the series of explosions continued, her ears started to go numb.\nStaring at the structures of the Heavenly Ritual Feast that endlessly spawned soldiers of Gluttony, she gradually began to wonder why she was swinging her club in the first place.\nThen, the faint memory of meeting Woo-jin in the snow-covered field resurfaced.\nShe clung to that faint memory like a lifeline, reminding herself of her purpose.\nThe soldiers of Gluttony continued to shatter.\nThe twin flames wrapped around her club burned and destroyed the soldiers.\nHong Gyu’s expression grew increasingly anxious at the unexpected level of destruction.\nSlowly, her magic power began to run out.\nBut Dal-bi didn’t stop and kept running toward Woo-jin.\nBy the time the explosions had faded from her ears.\nCrash.\nThe last remaining memories in Dal-bi’s mind quietly shattered.\n‘What was it? Why was I fighting…?’\nShe couldn’t remember why she was fighting.\nShe still had the memory of being forcibly taken away by the Principal. At that time, she had longed for someone. She had been sad to leave his side.\nWho was it?\nShe couldn’t remember.\nBut the lingering remnants of emotion still whispered to Dal-bi.\n“Huff, huff…”\nWhen she came to her senses, Dal-bi had already reached Woo-jin.\nThe faint sounds of the aftermath of the battle and explosions reached her ears.\nAll she could hear was the ringing in her ears and her own breathing.\nSummoning the last of her strength, Dal-bi used the goblin club to break the magical chains that had bound Woo-jin.\nCrack!\nDal-bi stood there, staring at Woo-jin, who looked at her in shock.\nIt was this man.\nHer memories were all gone, but her heart still told her.\nYou wielded the power of the goblin to save this man.\nBehind her, Hong Gyu, who had been staring at her in shock, was now charging toward her. The remaining soldiers of Gluttony followed suit.\nWhy… did you come to save me?\nWoo-jin’s lips seemed to form those words.\nThanks to her hearing still functioning, she heard Woo-jin’s trembling voice clearly.\nWhy?\nThe remnants of memories and emotions stirred within Dal-bi’s heart.\nHer face, covered in dirt and wounds, broke into a tearful smile.\nDal-bi summoned the sincerity buried deep in her heart and softly whispered the words she thought she would never have the chance to say.\n“Because I like you…”\nWith those words, the last of her remaining memories faded away.\nThud.\nIn the end, Dal-bi lost consciousness and collapsed into Woo-jin’s arms.\n“……”\nWoo-jin caught Dal-bi in his arms.\nHis face contorted with rage.\nThough his magic had been drained, his basic strength had returned since the chains of the God of Gluttony had been broken.\n“You bastards!!”\nHong Gyu shouted, throwing his axe.\nAt that moment.\nCrack!\nA rift tore through the air.\nThe blessing of the Golden Ram.\nRegardless of whether his magic was depleted, a rift opened in the air, sending the threat somewhere else.\nThe axe passed through the rift and disappeared.\n“What the hell!? How can you still have strength left!?”\nHong Gyu was visibly shocked.\nWhoosh!\nWoo-jin pulled out a black baton from his belt.\nByeokchuk-bong.\nWoo-jin’s pure magic had reached the 6th tier, greatly enhancing its destructive power. This most dangerous weapon, charged with his magic, was now in Woo-jin’s hand.\nWoo-jin took a deep breath, summoning all his strength as he swung the Byeokchuk-bong toward Hong Gyu and the soldiers of Gluttony.\nBoom!\nA massive explosion of turquoise lightning magic engulfed the area. The scale was enormous.\nHong Gyu, stunned, stopped in his tracks, quickly raising his magic to defend himself. The light was blinding like a flashbang. He covered his eyes with both arms, shielding his vision.\nWhen the explosion finally subsided, Hong Gyu lowered his arms.\n“…Huh.”\nHe let out a small laugh.\nWoo-jin and Dal-bi had already disappeared from the scene.",

      "content": "\"Ha... Ha...\"\nI leaned against the wall, trying to catch my breath. We had barely managed to escape, but it felt like my body had reached its limit.\nFortunately, there were some medical supplies nearby. Using the last of my strength, I wrapped a bandage around my wounds and took a moment to rest.\nWe had arrived at an empty private hospital room.\nDal-bi’s body was clearly overworked, evident from the state she was in. I wanted her to rest fully, but the situation didn’t allow for it.\nI gently laid the unconscious Dal-bi on the bed. I also applied some ointment to her wounds and wrapped them in bandages.\n“Hm?”\nDuring this process, something fell out of Dal-bi’s arms onto the floor. When I picked it up, I saw that it was a uniquely designed spinner.\n‘Is this... a disguise spinner?’\nRecalling my knowledge from the original story, I spun the spinner. As it spun, Dal-bi's appearance began to change, revealing the familiar figure of Kim Yeon-hee, the new student council member.\n‘So it was her…’\nA sigh escaped my lips.\n‘I’m not even surprised anymore.’\nI spun the spinner again, returning Dal-bi to her original appearance. Then, I placed the spinner back into her arms.\nLeaning against the wall, I peered out the window discreetly.\nThe familiar landscape confirmed my suspicions.\n‘As expected, this is the Zero Zone.’\nThis was the Zero Zone, a desolate, ash-gray city.\nThere was an official stance that the Zero Zone was outside the reach of the Golden Ram’s blessing, as the boundary of the blessing was unclear.\nBut as someone who knew the original story, I knew that was just a rumor. The Zero Zone was indeed within the reach of the Golden Ram’s blessing.\n‘I’m lucky I know the layout…’\nThough the game and reality were different, I at least had a sense of where certain buildings were located. Thanks to that, I didn’t get lost while escaping.\n‘Heavenly Ritual Feast…’\nThe barrier created by the Heavenly Ritual Feast was still emitting its mystical glow.\nThe God of Gluttony wouldn’t act for someone like me. Hong Gyu and his Army of Gluttony were probably trying to offer me back to the God of Gluttony.\nThe God of Gluttony was likely angry at having its meal interrupted.\n‘Unless I’m completely devoured by the God of Gluttony or Hong Gyu is defeated... that won’t disappear.’\nOne of us had to be eliminated for this fight to end.\n‘Maybe because it’s the Zero Zone. As a devout follower of the Principal, Hong Gyu isn’t just destroying everything.’\nI recalled Moon Chae-yeon’s testimony.\nThis place held all of the Principal’s secret and inhumane actions. With the capture of the Six Sinners, the Zero Zone had regained its purpose.\nAs such, Hong Gyu, a follower of the Principal, couldn’t act recklessly here.\n‘That means it’ll take some time for them to find us, as long as his sister doesn’t arrive too soon.’\nHong Gyu’s sister, Hong Bin.\nIf she appeared, hiding would be meaningless.\n‘Communication is down.’\nThe barrier seemed to block everything—my smartphone displayed “out of service,” and even the student council pager wasn’t working.\nWe were completely isolated, essentially trapped like rats.\nI leaned against the wall and sat on the floor.\n“Ugh…”\nPain shot through my body.\n‘My body is in bad shape, and my magic is depleted…’\nWhen magic is drained, it takes time to recover.\nEven though my 6th-tier body was still strong within the city, it meant nothing in front of Hong Gyu.\nMoreover, it was unlikely that my magic would recover before Hong Gyu found us.\nEven if it’s only for a few minutes, I needed to rest and regain as much strength as possible while considering how to escape.\n“……”\nI looked up at Dal-bi, who was lying on the bed.\nA mix of indescribable emotions swirled in my chest. Unable to express them, I just continued to take uneasy breaths.\n……\nThirty minutes later.\n“Ugh…”\nI heard Kim Dal-bi groan.\nI quickly got up and approached her.\n“You’re awake? How do you feel?”\n“……?”\nDal-bi looked at me with a puzzled expression.\n“Who are you?”\n“What?”\n“Who are you?”\nDal-bi asked with a tense expression.\nI couldn’t understand the intent behind her question.\n“You’re asking who I am? Are you serious?”\nWas she joking at a time like this? Could she really be that clueless?\nNo, it wasn’t a joking expression.\n“…Did you forget who I am?”\n“‘Forgot’...? Ah.”\nDal-bi suddenly sat up and gently touched her forehead. Her hand was trembling.\n“Did I... forget something again?”\n“‘Again’?”\n“There’s a lot of blanks in my memory… What happened to me? What did I do? Why is my memory like this...? Why is it like this...!? Ugh!”\nAs she seemed to be entering a state of panic, I quickly covered her mouth.\n“Quiet. The enemy is outside, searching for us.”\n“……”\nDal-bi lowered her head.\nShe noticed the bandages I had wrapped around her wounds and then looked at me, nodding.\nShe seemed to have inferred the situation.\nGiven the large gaps in her memory, she likely assumed she had fought to the point of exhaustion.\nShe probably saw me as an ally since I had treated her wounds.\nOnce she calmed down, I removed my hand. As I tried to put some distance between us, Dal-bi grabbed my sleeve and gently tugged.\n“You… know me, right?”\nDal-bi’s eyes trembled violently. She looked terrified.\nIt was the typical reaction of someone who couldn’t accept the harsh reality they were facing, trying to deny it.\n“Who are you…?”\n“……”\n“Once again, my past… it’s like it never existed… Once again… I hate this feeling….”\nMy mind froze for a moment at the sight of her.\nA flood of memories raced through my mind.\n‘…So that’s why.’\nI finally understood why Dal-bi’s difficult power seemed to lack any penalties.\nWhy she would become a great evil that would bring about dystopia.\n‘The penalty was her memories. Probably not just any memories, but the important, cherished ones.’\nJudging by how she had forgotten me, that seemed to be the case.\nI suddenly recalled the contents of the letter Dal-bi had left for me when I entered high school.\n─ ‘I’ve become a worthless person in this city… but I’m always on your side. ^_^’\nThe words written in the letter.\n‘It was self-deprecation.’\nIt was Dal-bi’s way of expressing self-hatred.\nThe familiarity I felt when I reunited and spoke with Dal-bi was also due to this.\nIn the original story, Dal-bi must have lost many of her memories as she unleashed the true power of her unique ability.\nIn the end, all that remained in Dal-bi’s mind was the detestable version of herself.\nShe must have accepted what she had become and ultimately broken down.\nAnd today, Dal-bi had pushed herself to her limits, using her utmost power to save me.\nAs a result, it seemed she had lost many of her memories.\n“Haa.”\nI took a deep breath.\nI felt disgusted with myself for having told Dal-bi that I hated her, for taking a vague stance because our relationship was no longer just a matter between the two of us, but because we were on opposing sides—me defending the city, and her trying to destroy it.\n‘How much of an idiot was I?’\nThe image of Baek-seo, who had her unique ability forcibly taken from her.\nThe sight of Dal-bi, who was now confused after losing her memories.\nBoth were clear evidence of my foolish actions.\nOf my powerlessness.\nI bit my lip.\nI clenched my trembling fist tightly.\nBlood began to seep out.\nI was furious.\nIt felt like my insides were being torn apart.\nI wanted to destroy everything.\nThe Six Sinners, the Principal, the Spartoi, and even Goliath.\nI wanted to crush them all.\n“Hey…?”\nDal-bi’s cautious voice rang in my ears, probably because I hadn’t said anything for a while.\nI had never really thought about how I should react when I learned the whole truth about Dal-bi.\nBut now, I thought I knew.\nAs the Student Council President, I had whipped myself into shape, telling myself that I had to prevent the dystopia from occurring, all while wearing a mask.\nBut now, I would throw all of that away.\nAll the complicated interests.\nThe disgusting underside of the city.\nThe dignity I had cultivated while being bound by laws and rules.\nI would throw it all away.\nI would discard the mask I had worn like a piece of trash and live according to my true desires.\nTo do that, I would seize the power I needed.\nAnd love the people I could love.\nSomething that had been tightly wound in my mind snapped. I felt like I had finally found a clear answer.\n“I see… So you’ve forgotten who I am.”\nI bent slightly to meet Dal-bi’s eyes.\nHaving discarded the mask of the Student Council President and everything else, I could finally recognize the emotion that had quietly lingered in my heart.\nRegret.\nI still harbored a small regret for Dal-bi.\n“Then I’ll remind you.”\nWhat emerged after that, without any emotional obstacles like those from childhood, was—\n“I’m the person who likes you.”\n—a pure smile.\nDal-bi’s eyes widened in disbelief. She looked like a startled puppy.\nI guessed that Dal-bi had kept her precious memories of me intact until now. How could I not realize that she still had lingering feelings for me?\nSo now, I would also fight for you.\nBecause I still liked you.\n“Someone like me… you like me?”\nI nodded.\n“I should be asking. Can someone like me like you?”\n“I don’t… know.”\n“Last time, I said some harsh things to you. We fought, too. I’m sorry. That was my mistake.”\n“I don’t remember any of that…”\n“I remember.”\nDal-bi’s head trembled at my firm declaration.\n“I remember everything.”\nDal-bi seemed unsure of how to respond. She was probably confused.\nA lack of memories doesn’t lead to the absence of the past.\nEven if all the traces of the past were erased, it wouldn’t matter.\nAs long as I remembered, Dal-bi’s past wouldn’t be lost.\nI just smiled gently to reassure her.\n“Can you move?”\nDal-bi shook her head.\n“I can’t move… I’m out of magic, too. What happened?”\n“Well… there was a battle. We barely managed to escape. Just rest for now. I’ll explain everything once you’re better.”\n“……”\nI gently patted Dal-bi on the bed, like soothing a baby.\n“It’s okay. Everything is okay.”\n“Mm…”\nDal-bi was mentally exhausted due to her confusion, still deeply fatigued.\nBut thanks to my efforts to reassure her with a smile, she quickly fell back into a peaceful sleep.\nHer soft, rhythmic breathing was endearing. I stroked her hair before leaning back against the wall to rest.\nTen minutes later.\nA sharp sense of awareness surged through me.\nA massive concentration of magic was approaching. It seemed Hong Gyu was closing in with the remaining soldiers of Gluttony.\n‘So, they’re coming.’\nJudging by how they had stopped searching and were now moving in one direction, they must have borrowed his sister Hong Bin’s abilities.\n‘This feeling…’\nI looked down at my hands.\nFocusing my attention and energy during the rest had brought forth a more palpable sensation.\nThe sensation from earlier when the God of Gluttony’s magic had forcefully tried to invade my magic circuits.\n‘The God of Gluttony’s magic must have done something to my circuits… something feels different.’\nThe magic that had tried to consume me seemed to have triggered something within my magic circuits. It was like touching a bomb ready to explode.\nIt felt similar to when I fought Han Seo-jin, but heavier. Like a dam full of water, ready to burst.\nMy magic had always been unusually pure.\nWith such high growth potential, it might have reacted intensely to strong stimuli.\nClenching my fist tightly, I stepped out of the hospital room.\nThe hallway was bathed in the light of the magic emanating from the Heavenly Ritual Feast. I walked down the corridor, pulling out the retractable baton from my belt.\nClick!\nThe hidden rod extended fully from inside.\nIt was the Iron Dragon Staff.\nWith it in hand, I exited the abandoned hospital.",

      "content": "\"You're finally here, sister!\"\nFive minutes earlier, in the Zero Zone.\nAs Hong-bin, the girl with sky-blue twin-tailed hair, approached, Hong-gyu greeted her enthusiastically. He attempted to embrace her, but she extended her arm to push him away.\n\"Get lost.\" \"Ouch, that firmness! I love that about you, sister!\" \"Please, just shut up.\"\nHong-bin cast a look of disdain at Hong-gyu.\nThen, she glanced around.\nThe Heavenly Ritual Feast was still active, with the soldiers of Gluttony surrounding Hong-gyu.\n\"You missed him, didn’t you?\" \"Yeah, Kim Dal-bi barged in and messed everything up.\" \"Kim Dal-bi...? So, she really did interfere in the end. That damned woman.\"\nHong-bin clicked her tongue, noticing Hong-gyu's meaningful smile.\n\"Why are you smiling?\" \"It was the Principal's plan to lure Kim Dal-bi here.\" \"...What?\"\nHong-bin couldn’t comprehend what he was saying.\nHong-gyu pointed to the back of his neck.\n\"Kim Dal-bi imprinted on An Woo-jin. Whenever An Woo-jin is in danger, the goblin senses it. The Principal knew about that.\" \"And so?\" \"When An Woo-jin got captured, Kim Dal-bi would come, and it was obvious she’d try to counter the Heavenly Ritual Feast. When that happened...\" \"...I see. Since Kim Dal-bi hadn’t been using her powers, the Principal wanted to force her to use them, turning her completely into a weapon. The penalty for her was the loss of precious memories. If protecting An Woo-jin was the problem, making her forget him and reminding her that she’s the Principal’s tool would solve everything.\" \"Exactly. Whether Kim Dal-bi succeeds or fails in resisting, An Woo-jin won’t escape from here anyway. Then, we can take An Woo-jin as planned and retrieve Kim Dal-bi after she forgets him.\"\nThe Principal wasn’t only targeting An Woo-jin.\nKim Dal-bi was also in his sights.\n\"That’s why they allowed Kim Dal-bi to enter the barrier. She probably thought it was my mistake. Ha, the fool.\" \"And the two others? Still can’t find them?\" \"They’re hiding well, like locals around here. Almost impossible to find them.\" \"......\" \"Anyway, we’re spreading out and searching, but no luck so far. Since this is the Principal's domain, we can’t just go around smashing things... That’s why I was waiting for you, sister.\" \"Sigh.\"\nHong-bin sighed, closing her eyes as she extended her arm forward.\nShe opened her hand and directed her palm to the ground. Transparent winds flowed from her hand, spreading out in all directions.\nHer unique ability, ‘Hunter.’ Magic Formula Type 1: ‘Radar.’\nA detection technique that spreads a minimal amount of magic across the area, making it difficult to detect but effective in finding targets.\nSoon, Hong-bin stopped channeling her magic and opened her eyes.\n\"Found them. Let’s go.\" \"As expected of my sister! You’re amazing, Hong-bin! I love you, Hong-bin!\" \"My ears hurt. Please, shut up.\"\nThe Gluttonous Twins, along with the soldiers of Gluttony, headed towards the abandoned hospital.\n\"Huh?\"\nHong-bin noticed a man sitting on the stairs in front of the hospital.\nHe was wearing a black school uniform with bandages wrapped around his head.\nHe was gripping what appeared to be a collapsible baton in his right hand, his head bowed.\nIt was as if he had been waiting for the Gluttonous Twins all along.\nThat man was An Woo-jin, the disciplinary officer of Ahseong High School.\nAn ominous aura emanated from him, causing the twins to instinctively swallow dryly, not knowing why.\n\"You couldn’t even figure out it was a hospital?\" \"There’s no sign indicating it’s a hospital, so how could I have known? But that arrogant bastard... He doesn’t have any magic left, yet he dares to wait for us?\"\nHe had only rested for barely an hour. In that condition, he wouldn’t have recovered properly.\nIt was impossible he had met a miraculous healer, and even if he had, it would take much longer for his depleted magic to recover.\nIn other words, Woo-jin’s decision to stay and wait for them instead of fleeing seemed utterly foolish to Hong-gyu.\n\"Does he realize he can’t escape? He doesn’t even know what my ability is, right? Or did he come up with some useless plan...\"\nAs Hong-bin cast a suspicious glance at Woo-jin, Hong-gyu extended his arm to block her.\n\"No way.\"\nIt didn’t matter.\n\"I’ll take care of him.\"\nHong-gyu took the lead, hands in his coat pockets, as he grinned and shouted at Woo-jin.\n\"You didn’t run away!? I commend your courage! But so what!? This place is nothing but a dining table where you’ll be devoured...!\" \"......\"\nWhen Woo-jin lifted his head, Hong-gyu froze in his tracks, his body trembling. Hong-bin had a similar reaction.\nThose ruthless teal eyes, as if they had abandoned everything, coiled around the twins like a snake. A chill ran down their spines.\nMagic resides in a person’s eyes.\nSomething unfathomable was contained within those eyes.\n\"That bastard... Hmph.\"\nHong-gyu squinted at Woo-jin, then let out a chuckle.\nHe thought he was nearing the end of a dull plan, but it seemed there was still some fun to be had.\n\"I believe you’ll make these remaining moments interesting.\"\nHong-gyu extended his right arm to the side. With a crack, the flesh of his arm swelled and turned a dark blue, forming into the shape of a grotesque monster.\nAs the creature’s massive maw opened, rows of sharp teeth were revealed. A similar maw appeared on the palm of Hong-gyu’s hand.\nHis unique ability, Shikshin. Magic Formula Type 1: ‘Predator.’\nWoo-jin rose from his spot, stepping toward the Gluttonous Twins and the army of Gluttony. He stopped and assumed a combat stance.\nHis heart pounded.\nAn overwhelming urge to destroy everything pounded heavily within his chest.\nThat explosive emotion engraved the sensation of his fight with Han Seo-jin into Woo-jin’s entire being.\nWoo-jin decided to trust in the potential of his own magic.\nWith a flash!\nWoo-jin and Hong-gyu launched themselves at each other, pushing off the ground.\nCrash!\nAs Iron Dragon Staff clashed with Predator, teal lightning erupted, and the sound of thunder reverberated.\nHong-gyu’s eyes widened before his face broke into a grin. He realized the teal lightning hadn’t come from Woo-jin.\nPreviously, An Woo-jin had used the Platinum Mileage he received from the Federation Council to enhance the Iron Dragon Staff once more.\nIron Dragon Staff, Level 2. The new secondary effect granted the weapon lightning magic with its basic strikes. The magic had been stored up, much like a charged Wall Staff.\nAdditionally, the more the caster’s magic was infused into the Iron Dragon Staff, the more the power of the lightning magic increased. However, with Woo-jin’s depleted magic, this function was utterly useless.\nClang!!\nThe difference in power was staggering.\nWoo-jin was easily knocked back, rolling across the ground for quite a distance.\nHe couldn’t even reinforce his body with magic.\n\"Guh!\"\nHong-gyu sneered at Woo-jin.\nWhoosh!!\nThe soldiers of Gluttony pushed past Hong-gyu, rushing at Woo-jin. Wind whipped through the air, causing Hong-gyu’s coat to flutter.\nWoo-jin hastily got to his feet, blocking the attack of a Gluttony soldier.\nZap! Clang!!\nThe Iron Dragon Staff and teeth clashed, causing a shockwave. Another soldier immediately slammed into Woo-jin, sending him flying.\nThough Woo-jin blocked with the Iron Dragon Staff, he couldn’t fully absorb the impact.\nBoom!!\nWith a sound like a cannon blast, Woo-jin’s body was hurled through the air like a ball. Crash!! The abandoned building crumbled as Woo-jin tumbled to the ground within.\n\"Guh...!\"\nWoo-jin coughed up blood as he struggled to move.\n\"!\"\nThere was no time to rest.\nIn the blink of an eye, Hong-gyu was upon him.\n\"Keep resisting, An Woo-jin!!!\"\nHong-gyu roared with laughter as the Predator’s teeth came crashing down.\nBoom!!\nWoo-jin swung the Iron Dragon Staff to block, but Hong-gyu overpowered him, sending him flying out of the building.\nThe Predator devoured part of the building, growing larger in size. Immediately, Hong-gyu lunged at Woo-jin again, who, barely holding onto his sanity, swung the Iron Dragon Staff in response.\nCrash!!\nSeveral clashes followed.\nThe Predator continued to chew through the outer walls of the building, growing larger each time. The bigger it grew, the harder it would be for Woo-jin to fend off.\nThe intense battle raged on, with buildings collapsing and a massive cloud of dust rising into the air.\nHong-gyu’s eyes widened.\n\"Oh no! The buildings!\"\nAmidst the airborne skirmish, Hong-gyu finally realized the gravity of the situation as three buildings collapsed. His head turned towards the falling structures.\nCrash!!\nIn that moment of distraction, Woo-jin fiercely swung the Iron Dragon Staff, striking Hong-gyu’s neck and sending him flying. Crash!! Hong-gyu was hurled into a building wall.\nWoo-jin grabbed hold of a window frame to avoid falling.\n\"It doesn't even tickle!\"\nHong-gyu lightly rotated his neck before kicking off from the wall and charging at Woo-jin. Like an arrow, the Predator lunged forward.\nWoo-jin let go of the window frame and dropped down, narrowly dodging Hong-gyu. Crack!! Instead of a crash, the sound of something being devoured echoed. The Predator, with its maw wide open, consumed the building’s outer wall.\nAs the concrete wall was devoured, the Predator’s outer shell hardened. By now, its size had reached a threatening level.\nWhoosh!! The soldiers of Gluttony followed suit, leaping towards Woo-jin. Their massive jaws all aimed directly at him.\nIt was obvious what would happen if Woo-jin were caught by those all-consuming mouths. If he was lucky, he might only suffer severe bodily damage.\nRelying purely on his combat instincts, Woo-jin swung the Iron Dragon Staff in retaliation, kicking off one of the soldiers as he fell to the ground.\nAs he rolled across the ground and barely stood up, the soldiers of Gluttony came charging at him again without giving him any time to rest. With a flick of his wrist, Woo-jin drew the Wall Staff with his remaining hand and continued the fight.\n\"No matter how much you struggle, what’s the point!? Huh!?\"\nHong-gyu, having reached the ground in an instant, joined the soldiers in attacking Woo-jin, shouting as he did so. But Woo-jin had no time to respond.\nHe could only keep fighting, taking blow after blow.\n\"Are you doing this to protect Kim Dal-bi!?\"\nBoom!\nHong-gyu’s kick sent Woo-jin flying. He zipped through the air and crashed into a building wall.\nRumble, rumble. Despite vomiting a mouthful of blood, Woo-jin refused to lose consciousness.\nThe pain was excruciating. It felt as though his bones and organs had been completely shattered.\nBut that didn’t matter. Woo-jin summoned the last of his strength, raising both the Iron Dragon Staff and the Wall Staff in his hands.\n\"I respect your resolve.\"\nHong-gyu smirked as he walked toward Woo-jin.\n\"Out of courtesy, I’ll crush you first, then go after Kim Dal-bi.\" \"Thanks for that...\"\nHong-gyu charged at Woo-jin again.\nWoo-jin had no time to think.\nHe relied entirely on his combat instincts, fighting back as best he could.\nThud! Suddenly, a magic-infused arrow pierced Woo-jin's thigh. His eyes widened. He looked in the direction the arrow came from and saw Hong-bin holding a crossbow.\nThe arrow had simply been enhanced with magic to increase its penetrating power. Hong-bin had accurately assessed that Woo-jin was reaching his limit and used it to push him further.\nDespite this, Woo-jin continued to fight back with all his might. Hong-gyu, initially toying with Woo-jin, started to find his persistence annoying.\nWoo-jin narrowed his eyes.\nCountless memories flashed through his mind. Even the scenery around him began to change. Was this a near-death experience?\nIn those memories, from his childhood, he recalled a snowy day when he met Kim Dal-bi in a snow-covered field.\nCrash!!\nThe sound of lightning filled his ears.\nThere was a series of loud booms and shockwaves.\nAmidst it all, Woo-jin inexplicably found himself recalling Kim Dal-bi’s voice.\n— \"Is your name Woo-jin?\" — \"Yeah.\" — \"I was bored! Since you talked to me, you’re responsible for keeping me entertained!\" — \"Huh?\"\nAs they walked hand in hand and fell into the snow, he remembered the sound of Dal-bi’s laughter filling his mind with warmth.\nWoo-jin remembered Dal-bi from that day.\nCrash!!\nHe remembered the flowers and letters he gave to Dal-bi, saying he liked her.\nHe remembered the times when Dal-bi would visit his home to cook for him.\nHe remembered praising her as her cooking skills improved, making her blush and act smug.\nHe remembered pretending to be excited when Dal-bi gave him a robot, making her feel proud.\nHe remembered the countless times he told Dal-bi he liked her.\nHe remembered the hugs they shared.\nHe remembered that warmth.\nHe remembered the day they gazed at the cityscape together, hoping to stay together in the future.\nCrash!!\nI remember.\nI hold onto our past together.\nSo, it’s okay.\nI’ll never forget the memories I have with you.\nWoo-jin had already collapsed.\nHe had no strength left, lying still on the ground, his gaze fixed on the sky enclosed by the barrier.\nHe breathed quietly, barely clinging to life.\n\"......\"\nHong-gyu looked at Woo-jin for a moment, then sighed.\n\"The final entertainment was pretty dull.... Let’s go. The feast isn’t over yet.\"\nThe soldiers of Gluttony lifted Woo-jin. They began walking towards where the Shikshin awaited.\nHong-gyu, appearing bored, tried to put on a cheerful face when he noticed Hong-bin.\n\"Sister! It’s over!\" \"Brother, go back to the Shikshin. I’ll handle Kim Dal-bi.\" \"Alright, alright, then...\"\nAt that moment.\n\"!\"\nHong-gyu and Hong-bin froze. Their survival instincts screamed at them.\nSuddenly, an overwhelming amount of magic filled the area, crushing their bodies with its sheer weight. The pressure was so immense that even breathing became difficult.\nThey realized something was terribly wrong.\nHong-gyu quickly turned his head back, trying to catch a glimpse of Woo-jin.\nJust then...\n...Thunk.\nA profound silence fell over the area.\nHong-gyu and Hong-bin felt as if they had been suspended in an unfamiliar space. And far off in the distance, beyond the void, they saw a strange creature.\nA transcendent being of the ninth rank.\nAs they gazed upon the creature that emitted a vivid golden light, they instinctively recognized it as the \"Golden Ram.\"\nAn overwhelming sense of fear gripped them, squeezing their hearts tight.\nTheir bodies trembled uncontrollably, and they blinked. Suddenly, the familiar scenery of the Zero Zone returned to their vision.\n\"What... was that?\" \"Brother!!\"\nHong-bin’s scream, as if she were tearing apart, made Hong-gyu realize something was wrong.\nThere was nothing around them.\nThe soldiers of Gluttony had all vanished.\nEven Woo-jin was gone.\nHong-gyu turned to look at Hong-bin and noticed her gaze was fixed upward.\nAs he urgently looked up, the hand of a falling man gripped Hong-gyu’s face.\nIn that fleeting moment, Hong-gyu sensed the incomprehensible difference in power. The man slammed Hong-gyu's head into the ground.\nCrash!!\n\"Guh!!\"\nThe ground shattered, and dust billowed out.",

      "content": "Even though Hong-gyu had reinforced his body with magic, the impact was intense.\nHe looked up at the man who had slammed him into the ground, and saw those deadly teal eyes staring back at him.\nIt was An Woo-jin, his face expressionless. Beyond him, the soldiers of Gluttony were falling from the sky, their forms completely ruined.\nSuddenly, Hong-gyu felt a sense of déjà vu.\nThis situation…\nWasn’t it similar to what happened at the funeral?\nWoo-jin released his grip on Hong-gyu’s face and raised his fist. Hong-gyu quickly summoned the Predator from his arm, aiming it at Woo-jin.\nBut then—\nCRACK!!\n\"……!\"\nIn an instant, the Iron Dragon Staff swung out, infused with powerful electric magic, and sent the Predator flying.\nThis lightning magic was far stronger than what had been used earlier.\nIn other words…\n'He’s recovered his magic!? How…!?'\nThere was no time to be shocked.\nThe Predator was shattered into pieces, and Hong-gyu's blood splattered everywhere. Just as Hong-gyu was about to scream, Woo-jin’s fist came crashing down.\nBOOM!!\n\"Ugh!\"\nA massive shockwave struck, and the ground caved in under the pressure.\n\"Kyaaah!\"\nHong-bin was swept off her feet by the shockwave, staggering as she tried to regain her balance.\nHong-gyu felt his consciousness slipping away.\n\"Didn’t you say this was boring?\"\n\"W-wait….\"\nWoo-jin swung his fist again.\nBOOM!!\n\"Argh!\"\nHong-gyu’s face was smashed, his teeth and blood flying out.\n\"Is it fun now?\"\n\"S-stop…!\"\nWoo-jin swung his fist once more.\nBOOM!!\n\"Aaah…!\"\nWoo-jin continued to pummel Hong-gyu with relentless punches.\nBANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!\nEach strike was powerful enough to crush the face of even the strongest fighters in Neo Seoul. Woo-jin's fists were covered in blood.\nHong-bin realized that just approaching Woo-jin would subject her to severe physical shock. The force of each punch was equivalent to a deadly weapon.\n\"Brother!\"\nHong-bin summoned arrows infused with magic, surrounding herself with them.\nThe intensity of the magic was at its peak.\nWHOOOSH!\nAs the glow of the magic increased, the area was filled with arrows.\nHer unique ability, Hunter. Magic Formula Type 2: 'Focused Shot.'\nEach magic arrow possessed incredible penetrating power. That was the strength of the Hunter.\n'So he advanced to a higher rank at this moment…!'\nHong-bin immediately understood the situation.\nWoo-jin’s rank had increased, breaking through the barriers that had previously blocked his magic circuits.\nThis phenomenon occurs each time one’s rank rises. Like a dam bursting after being filled to the brim, magic surged explosively.\nWoo-jin had stepped into a new realm of power.\n\"Stop immediately!!\"\nHong-bin screamed at the top of her lungs, aiming her crossbow at Woo-jin.\nSWISH SWISH SWISH!!\nThe arrows fired.\nThe countless magic arrows converged on their target—Woo-jin.\nHong-bin, using her Hunter’s power, controlled the trajectory of the magic arrows. In other words, the barrage of arrows raining down like a storm was a guided attack, all aimed solely at Woo-jin.\nBut it was futile.\nWoo-jin’s senses had become razor-sharp, allowing him to track each magic arrow. This was already beyond the realm of human capabilities.\nCRACK!!\n\"!\"\nA series of fractures appeared in the air. Before the magic arrows could follow Hong-bin’s control and avoid the cracks, they were all swallowed up by the fractures.\nSuddenly, the space around Hong-bin was covered in cracks, forming a curtain-like barrier. Woo-jin had gained the ability to manipulate even the form of these fractures.\n\"Bina!!\"\nHong-gyu let out a desperate cry.\nHong-bin was so overwhelmed by the sheer pressure of the fractures that she didn’t even think to escape.\nBut escape was impossible.\nShe knew the fractures would follow her.\nAnd then—\nSWISH SWISH SWISH!!\n\"Aaaah!!!\"\nA blood-curdling scream tore through the air.\nWoo-jin’s unique ability: Space Domination. Magic Formula Type 3: Inverted Space.\nAs the curtain of fractures dissipated, Hong-bin’s body, pierced by countless magic arrows, was revealed. Blood poured out like a waterfall.\nWith a thud, Hong-bin collapsed to the ground, the magic arrows dissolving into light as they vanished. The wounds on her body bled profusely, forming a pool of blood.\nHong-bin, her face disfigured, looked over at Hong-gyu.\n\"B-brother….\" \"Bina!! Bina!!\"\nWith those final words, Hong-bin lost consciousness.\nHong-gyu, still clinging to consciousness, looked at his sister's horrifyingly mutilated body and gasped for air. His face twisted into an expression of pure rage.\n\"You… you…. Aaaagh!!!\"\nGrinding his teeth, Hong-gyu screamed, drawing upon every last bit of his magic.\nWoo-jin stepped back, watching Hong-gyu. Soon, Hong-gyu’s entire body swelled and morphed into the form of a massive, multi-headed serpent, revealing its enormous jaws.\nA grotesque creature.\nThe strongest weapon Hong-gyu possessed after the Heavenly Ritual Feast.\nHis unique ability, Shikshin. Magic Formula Type 5: 'Hydra.'\nHong-gyu hated taking this form.\nIt made him look like a monster.\nBut there was no other choice if he wanted to confront Woo-jin now.\nIn this form, he could endure even Woo-jin’s electric magic.\n[An Woo-jin…!]\nHydra Hong-gyu’s voice was distorted.\n[How dare you… How dare you hurt my sister!! You dare!!!] \"'Your sister,' huh? How touching.\"\nWoo-jin chuckled derisively, a rare expression for him.\n\"Well…, I figured it would come to this.\"\nWoo-jin shrugged nonchalantly.\n[You filthy bastard!!]\nThe many heads of the Hydra opened their jaws wide, drooling profusely.\nThe Predator’s traits included unbreakable toughness and the ability to devour anything.\nMoreover, this place was Shikshin’s dining table, the Heavenly Ritual Feast.\nWith Shikshin’s magic still being supplied, the full force of the Hydra’s power would be too much for even a seventh-rank mage to handle.\nBut Woo-jin showed no interest, ignoring the Hydra as he glanced around.\n\"Now that I think about it, this city….\"\nHe recalled Moon Chae-yeon’s testimony.\nThis place was where all the misfortune of Baek-seo and Kim Dal-bi began.\nAnd for the other Six Sinners.\nAnd for many other children who were 'discarded,' never seeing the light of day.\nSo, this place, the Zero Zone…\n\"This place… needs to be destroyed.\"\nWoo-jin's eyes glowed with a mix of blue and purple light. He extended his arm and channeled the power of Space Domination.\nHe was certain.\nIn his current state, he could reverse even the sky and the earth.\nRUMBLE!!\n[……!]\nThe Hydra felt a chill of terror.\nThe ground shook.\nBuildings trembled, and a deafening roar echoed.\nA terrifying magic filled the area.\nSomething that should never happen was about to occur.\nAnd then—\nCRAAAAASH!!!\n[What…!?]\nIt was as if the ground beneath them had hollowed out, and it began to collapse.\nWhat emerged was a massive rift that had formed beneath the ground.\nThe enormous rift was consuming the earth.\nGolden Ram had said that if one mastered the unique ability of Space Domination, they could even drop meteors from the universe.\nTo do so, one had to imagine an invisible hand that could pull matter into the rift.\nAt this moment, Woo-jin had instinctively grasped that principle, allowing him to drag even the earth into the rift.\n[How is this possible!?]\nHong-gyu’s shocked voice erupted from the Hydra’s mouth.\nThe ground, except for the area around Woo-jin and the abandoned hospital, was being swallowed by the rift.\nBuildings.\nStructures.\nEverything on the surface.\nThe Hydra, being a living creature, wasn’t affected by the rift and simply passed through it, but the result was that it was falling.\nIts gaze wandered over the vast, dark abyss beneath it. Soon, it realized why the ground below had been so thoroughly excavated, and a chill ran down its spine.\nWoo-jin hadn’t created just one rift.\nHe had simultaneously opened multiple enormous rifts beneath the ground, hollowing out the earth in advance.\nCould this really be a magic formula that a human could achieve?\nCRAAAASH!!!\nThe Zero Zone had become a vast and empty chasm.\nFinally, the massive rift that had swallowed the ground vanished like a TV being turned off.\nAs the Hydra fell into the abyss, it looked up at the only source of light—the sky.\nCRACK!!\nInside the barrier.\nThe sky split open, and a massive rift appeared, covering the entire view.\nThe rift, shimmering with a mix of blue and purple light, boasted an astronomical magic density.\nRUMBLE!!!\nSoon, the rift that had covered the inside of the barrier began to drop all the debris it had absorbed.\nThe ground came crashing down.\nIt was an overwhelming sight.\nThe Hydra—no, Hong-gyu—stared at the scene in disbelief, even as the debris rained down from the sky. He couldn’t fathom that what he was witnessing was reality.\nThe seventh rank.\nA level where unique abilities enter the realm of catastrophic power.\nIn Neo Seoul, only Goliath and Spartan Seo Gang-jin had reached this level.\nOnly monsters among monsters could attain the seventh rank.\nAnd with Woo-jin’s extraordinarily pure magic, he was capable of reaching even higher realms.\nHong-gyu had no chance of winning.\nGradually, the Hydra’s form began to unravel.\nAs the magic dispersed, Hong-gyu reverted to his human form. His face showed a mix of complex emotions.\nEmptiness, helplessness, futility, and resignation.\nAll of these emotions intertwined.\nThe final destination was surrender.\n'I can’t win against that…'\nHong-gyu decided to give up everything.\nHe released the Predator from his arm, reaching out to pull his sister Hong-bin, who was falling alongside him, into his embrace.\nHe looked at her with gentle eyes, holding her more dearly than anything in the world.\nBut Hong-bin didn’t move. She had already become a cold corpse.\nAll of the Six Sinners who became the Principal’s subordinates experienced the same fate in the Zero Zone.\nWrapped in powerful magic, they were subjected to forced, painful training day after day.\nThose who couldn’t endure died, and those who survived were used by the Principal.\nBut Hong-gyu had found salvation.\nThe fact that his twin sister, Hong-bin, had barely survived was his salvation.\nWhen he first met his sister, Hong-bin, he was overjoyed.\nAt least from the moment he was born, he had a reason to live.\nRUMBLE!!!\nEverything fell.\nThe Shikshin.\nThe soldiers of Gluttony.\nThe twin siblings.\nEverything was buried beneath the remnants of the city falling from the sky.",

      "content": "\"It seems that he’s not a man who will die here after all.\"\nCentral Tower.\nSpartoi Son Ye-seo spoke up.\nPrincipal Lee Doo-hee stared silently out the window in the direction of the Zero Zone.\nFrom their high vantage point, they could observe what was happening in the distant Zero Zone. Even with poor eyesight, the magnification feature on the window made it possible.\nThe barrier of the Heavenly Ritual Feast had been broken, and the Zero Zone was now a complete ruin.\nThe Principal's hands, resting on the armrests of her wheelchair, trembled. Even someone like her couldn't help but be shocked.\nShe had been confident that she could turn Kim Dal-bi into a perfect weapon and gain control over the power of Space Domination. She had dismissed any variables as insignificant.\nWho could have predicted that An Woo-jin would reach the seventh rank and turn everything to ashes?\nThere had never been a case in human history where someone rose from the fourth rank to the seventh in just a few months. Not even Goliath had done that.\nSomething that was deemed impossible, something beyond the scope of any prediction, had occurred.\n\"I see…\"\nFinally, the Principal realized the truth.\n\"I underestimated that boy…\"\n\"Well? I think saying you underestimated him is a bit misleading. Didn’t you use even the most secretive magic formula of the Gluttons?\"\n\"No, I should have considered the possibility that the magic might not work. Bringing Kim Dal-bi into it was excessive, a mistake. That boy, An Woo-jin, is not someone who can be dealt with using historical precedent or knowledge. I misjudged completely…\"\nThe Principal's eyes gleamed with murderous intent.\n\"That boy is a monster. I should have treated him as a threat on par with Goliath…\"\nThe Principal blinked slowly.\n\"In fact, that boy might be even more dangerous than Goliath.\"\n\"A monster with that kind of growth speed needs to be crushed as quickly as possible…, is that what you're saying?\"\n\"That’s one aspect. But Goliath is unpredictable, while that boy likely harbors a deep grudge over everything that has happened. He must already know that I’m behind it all. When someone with power harbors anger, the consequences are obvious.\"\n\"So, what will you do?\"\nYe-seo asked with a smile.\n\"I will declare martial law.\"\nThe Principal had decided that An Woo-jin was the worst possible enemy.\n\"Spread false accusations against An Woo-jin, claiming he is planning a coup or involved in corruption, and then mobilize all forces. In two days, we will execute ‘Darts.’\"\nDarts.\nA game where countless darts are thrown to hit the bullseye.\nThe powerful figures who move in the shadows of Neo Seoul, Spartoi’s forces, and Neo Seoul itself would all target An Woo-jin.\nThis was a risky and aggressive move for the Principal, but she had no other options against An Woo-jin.\n\"I see…. The final option, then. Understood.\"\nYe-seo replied with a bright smile.\nTime passed, the dust settled, and silence returned.\nThe place that had once been the Zero Zone was now a complete wasteland, reminiscent of a battlefield.\nWith Hong-gyu buried alive, the barrier of the Heavenly Ritual Feast was lifted, and the city was shrouded in darkness.\nThe only places left intact were the ground beneath my feet and the abandoned hospital.\nThose two areas were protected by new rifts that had formed above them, preventing the building debris from falling on them.\nI stared at the spot where Hong-gyu and Hong-bin had fallen.\nDespite this being my first act of killing, I felt an inexplicable sense of calm in my heart.\nPerhaps it was because they were people who deserved to die, or maybe it was due to the anger that had filled my heart, or the self-justification that I had no other choice. It could also be that my emotions had dried up after reaching the seventh rank, or maybe it was all of these reasons combined.\nI wasn’t sure.\nBut right now… I was surprisingly numb.\n'My magic… has it run dry again?'\nEven though I had ascended in rank and replenished my magic, it was merely a temporary store of energy. It wasn’t an abundant amount.\nYet, considering the power I had just unleashed, I couldn’t fully grasp where I now stood.\n'It seems I won’t be seeing Golden Ram for a while.'\nGiven that my magic was depleted, it seemed unlikely that I would see Golden Ram again anytime soon.\nI didn’t know how long this 'temporary' state would last. While my magic recovery rate would have increased at the seventh rank, it was uncertain when I would fully recover from this magic depletion.\n'But more importantly…'\nI began walking. Stepping over the debris, I made my way to the abandoned hospital, where I found Kim Dal-bi, still asleep, and carried her out. She was still deeply unconscious.\nDespite all the chaos, she hadn’t woken up. It seemed her body had reached its limit.\n'Even if I had remained at the sixth rank, I wouldn’t have been able to defeat them.'\nIt was no wonder Dal-bi was so exhausted. The fact that a sixth-rank mage had saved me at Shikshin’s dining table was proof that she had pushed herself to the limit.\nThough our situation was different, in the original story, Goliath had struggled to overcome the magic of the Heavenly Ritual Feast.\nIt was impressive, really.\nI couldn’t even move.\nHowever, after that, Goliath overexerted himself and became exhausted. That happened in the latter part of the original story when the player had grown stronger.\nThanks to that, the protagonist, Lee Tae-sung, was able to defeat Goliath.\n'But that won’t happen now.'\nThe Heavenly Ritual Feast had expended itself targeting me, so Goliath wouldn’t tire out as he did in the original story. This meant I would have to fight Goliath at full strength.\nThe difficulty had increased significantly compared to the original story.\nBut, at least there was some hope.\nThe rapid pace of my growth was something to hold on to.\nMaybe by the time we face off, I might be able to put up a fight.\nStep by step, I walked through the desolate remains of the Zero Zone.\nThe buildings were all destroyed beyond recognition, allowing the cold wind to blow freely against my skin.\nAs I continued walking,\nWHOOSH!!\n\"!\"\nSuddenly, a heavy wave of magic enveloped my entire body. I looked up to see a large, muscular man coming into view.\nHe was smiling boldly, revealing a set of large teeth.\nThe pale moonlight illuminated his long blonde hair. His sudden appearance was so out of place that I wondered if it was a hallucination. But no, he was very real.\n\"Goliath…?\"\nGoliath.\nThe last of the Six Sinners and the strongest being in Neo Seoul.\nThe one who was freer than anyone else in this city.\nYet, despite his sudden appearance, I wasn’t surprised. He had shown up when I awakened my unique ability, so it wasn’t unexpected that he’d appear now that I had reached the seventh rank.\nGoliath approached, stepping over the rubble with his massive feet, flashing a sinister smile that exposed his beast-like teeth.\nAs he drew closer, his imposing figure filled my vision. His presence was overwhelming.\nI had no strength left to fight. If Goliath attacked, I would have no choice but to be defeated.\nBut, as expected, Goliath didn’t seem to be here to fight.\n\"An Woo-jin.\"\nHis deep voice resonated.\nI could hear a growling sound, like that of a beast, coming from between his teeth. He looked down at me and spoke.\n\"You’ve awakened once again. Impressive…!\"\nGoliath’s voice was filled with excitement.\nHow ridiculous…\n\"You felt the magic and came… just to say that? Are we close enough to be exchanging congratulations?\"\n\"You should know by now that I’ve been watching you.\"\n\"Yeah… thanks for that.\"\nWith a resigned sigh, I adjusted Dal-bi on my back and walked past Goliath.\nAs I took a few steps, Goliath spoke again, without even turning to look at me.\n\"What is it that you seek?\"\nI stopped and turned to face him.\n\"What is it you’re fighting for?\"\nI wasn’t sure if it was some kind of edgy, philosophical question, but…\nIt seemed like an opportunity to understand Goliath’s intentions, so I turned fully toward him.\n\"Just… freedom. The freedom to live happily with the people I care about.\"\nThat’s why I was fighting so hard.\n\"You can pursue your freedom here in this city. But for people like me, it’s not that simple.\"\n\"Freedom…!\"\nGoliath smiled as he met my gaze.\n\"It’s worth pursuing! The acquisition of rights is the product of struggle…! A life without freedom is unimaginable!\"\n\"And what about you? What are you pursuing?\"\nI couldn’t predict his actions.\nI had no idea about his values or beliefs.\nGoliath tilted his head up and looked down at me arrogantly.\n\"This city.\"\n\"……?\"\nHis response caught me off guard, and I narrowed my eyes.\n\"Are you talking about preserving or developing this city?\"\n\"No, it’s more fundamental than that.\"\n\"What do you mean…?\"\n\"What I seek is a hero. A hero for this city…!\"\nIt was within my expectations that he would give a response that didn’t make any sense.\nBut at least one thing became clear to me.\n\"A hero… So, you knew what the Principal has been doing all along?\"\nWould the strongest being who wanted a hero for the city be unaware of the Principal’s atrocities?\nI was skeptical.\n\"Of course.\"\nGoliath answered without hesitation.\n\"An Woo-jin, do you know that the first murder in human history was committed with a stone?\"\nThe Bible says that the first murder was between brothers. Cain, the older brother, killed Abel, the younger, with a stone.\nIf you consider the story in the Bible as a reference, that would be the case.\nI nodded.\n\"In the beginning, do you think concepts like good and evil existed? Do you believe that what morals and laws pursue is what is right?\"\n\"Are you having a late teenage crisis or something? It doesn’t suit you, so cut the crap and get to the point.\"\nGoliath spread his massive arms wide.\n\"What I seek is Neo Seoul, the very foundation of life blessed by the Golden Ram! I want to see ‘who is right’ in this city…!\"\nGood and evil.\nBlack and white.\nHe wasn’t viewing the world in such a binary way. What I called the Principal’s atrocities, Goliath seemed to want to observe and judge whether they were 'right' or 'wrong.'\nFrom that statement, I gathered some information.\n\"Does that mean the Principal’s goal is to benefit the city?\"\nDoes the Principal believe her actions are for the good of Neo Seoul?\n\"That’s an answer no one knows. It’s not just the Principal. I’m watching 'everyone'…!\"\nAll the citizens.\nOr, considering Goliath’s stature, he might be referring to all living beings.\nIn the end, he meant that he would observe who would lead the 'rightness' for this foundation of life.\nWhy would someone like him become one of the Six Sinners?\nWhy would he later bring about a dystopia?\nThese questions arose, and I couldn’t help but click my tongue.\n\"Arrogant bastard.\"\nNo matter how strong you are, it’s not up to you to decide who’s right. I replaced what I wanted to say with a simple insult. Did he think he was some kind of god?\nGoliath simply responded with a grin.\nOnce my magic recovered, I planned to return and crush the Principal and everything related to her.\nGoliath included.\nI turned my back on him and started walking again. Behind me, I heard a loud boom and felt a gust of wind. I looked up at the sky and saw Goliath flying away like a shooting star.\nBzzz.\nAs I continued walking out of the Zero Zone, my smartphone vibrated in my pocket. This was the moment I had been waiting for.\nI gently laid Dal-bi on the ground and pulled out my smartphone. The screen showed that I was now in a service area, and missed calls and messages began flooding in.\nJust as I was about to call the student council executive—\n\"Huh?\"\nIn the distance, I noticed vehicles driving down the road. The streetlights and headlights made it easy to distinguish them.\nThere was no reason for vehicles to come here.\nThe lights were familiar.\n'Our disciplinary committee…?'\nThe disciplinary committee from Ahseong High School was coming here.\n'Did Baek-seo bring them?'\nThe missed calls were mostly from Baek-seo, more than ten in total. She must have figured out the situation and called the committee together.\n'So, Baek-seo is here.'\nThe entire Zero Zone had been reduced to ruins.\nMoreover, it was a vast area.\nIf Baek-seo had been searching around, it was likely we had missed each other.\nI focused on detecting magic. I sensed a faint flow of magic coming from behind me.\nI turned around and saw small flashes of lightning flickering in the distance, in the direction of the Zero Zone.\nIt was the distinct color of Baek-seo’s magic.\nThe lightning-clad figure was heading toward me, likely detecting the magic that Goliath had spread.\nI felt a pang of guilt, realizing she must have been anxious, just like during the Han Seo-jin incident.\nI raised the Iron Dragon Staff and sent a burst of teal lightning into the air. It was a secondary effect of its enhancement, unaffected by my depleted magic.\nWhen Baek-seo saw the signal, she quickened her pace and rushed toward me.\n\"Baek…!\"\nSuddenly, Baek-seo embraced me without saying a word.\nIt then dawned on me that I had forgotten the state I was in—utterly battered.\nI placed my hand on Baek-seo’s back. Her body was trembling slightly. I could tell she had been scared.\n\"…Baek-seo.\"\n\"I couldn’t get in touch with you.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"I couldn’t reach you, and then I heard you disappeared after interrogating Moon Chae-yeon….\"\nBaek-seo whispered. Her voice, uncharacteristically, had a slight tremor.\n\"I also learned that something had gone wrong in the Zero Zone.\"\n\"So you came for me. Thank you.\"\n\"…….\"\nBaek-seo said nothing more.\n\"President.\"\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"Don’t make me feel so powerless again….\"\nBaek-seo didn’t move away from me. She didn’t want to show her face.\n\"…Alright. I won’t.\"\nFinally, as Baek-seo seemed to calm down, I gently moved her out of my embrace. Her face was filled with concern. It seemed that even maintaining her usual poker face was difficult for her right now.\n\"Is this… your doing?\"\nShe was asking if I was responsible for the destruction of the Zero Zone.\nShe must have sensed the magic I unleashed when I reached the seventh rank. That’s probably how she knew it was me.\nI nodded, and Baek-seo let out a sigh.\n\"This is unbelievable….\"\n\"More importantly, can you take her?\"\nI nodded toward Dal-bi, who was lying on the ground.\n\"…Did you fight her?\"\nBaek-seo looked down at Dal-bi and asked quietly. Her voice carried a subtle tension, as if she was both wary and afraid.\n\"No, it’s the opposite.\"\nI knelt down and gently brushed Dal-bi’s pale pink hair aside.\n\"She saved me.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"I survived because Dal-bi stepped in. It might not matter now, but she’s the one who gave me that peony flower.\"\nBaek-seo flinched slightly.\nShe couldn’t believe that the person I had said was precious to me was one of the Six Sinners. Understandable, even I would find that hard to believe.\n\"And Baek-seo, I’m sorry.\"\n\"For what?\"\nI looked at Dal-bi, who was still deep in sleep.\nI realized that I couldn’t give up on her.\nI couldn’t lie to Baek-seo about something like this.\nPushing aside the guilt, I finally spoke up, revealing my true feelings.\n\"I… I like her too.\"\n\"…What?\"\n\"I like Kim Dal-bi, the goblin.\"\nIt might have been my imagination, but in the dim light of the night, it looked like Baek-seo’s face turned pale after a slight delay.\n\"Uh…?\"\nAs I waited for Baek-seo’s reaction, the air between us grew awkward, and the conversation fell silent. I had a sinking feeling that something was going wrong.\nIn the distance, I could hear the approaching sirens of the disciplinary committee's vehicles.",

      "content": "Somewhere in Another World\nIn a land of eternal night where will-o'-the-wisps floated and shadows wandered, a lone goblin sat on the throne in the grand hall of the Goblin Palace, propping his chin on his hand.\nTwo other goblins, towering figures with muscular builds, stood on either side of the throne, holding magical clubs and guarding their king. They were dressed in modified hanbok, resembling the attire of military officers from the Joseon Dynasty.\nThe Goblin King's narrow eyes focused on the intruder who had entered the grand hall.\nShe was wearing a school uniform.\nA girl with golden hair that fluttered as she walked forward.\nA human form.\n[“What business does an avatar of the Golden Ram have in my realm? I don’t recall inviting you, nor did I permit your entry.”]\nThe Goblin King spoke in a calm tone, though his voice was laced with wariness.\n\"In my presence, spatial restrictions are meaningless.\"\nThe golden-haired intruder, Golden Ram, stopped in her tracks, crossing her arms and responding indifferently.\n\"You're the Goblin King, right? I've come to have a word with you.\"\nGolden Ram had been watching over An Woo-jin and Kim Dal-bi for a long time. She had noticed something troubling and had come to this otherworldly realm to resolve it.\nThis was not the world Woo-jin lived in but another parallel world.\nA place where beings of high rank, who couldn’t be observed by humans and were often considered 'gods,' resided.\n\"Kim Dal-bi. The price for using her powers seems incredibly unfair, doesn’t it?\"\n[“Does being an avatar of the Golden Ram give you the right to meddle in others' affairs?”]\nThe Goblin King retorted with a hint of irritation in his voice.\n[“All I desire are the vivid resources that arise from intense memories and emotions. I don’t understand why that bothers you. If anything, you should be pleased that she can use my powers to that extent.”]\nA unique ability.\nAs Golden Ram had explained to Woo-jin, it was a type of power granted by beings of a higher dimension.\nThe unique ability that Kim Dal-bi possessed was derived from the Goblin King.\n[“But why are you concerned with our matters?”]\n\"For a simple reason: it annoys me.\"\n[“What?”]\n\"Seeing someone lose their memories isn’t exactly pleasant from where I stand.\"\nThe Goblin King exhaled deeply.\n[“I had no intention of making a contract with such a human in the first place.”]\n\"...I didn’t expect that answer. What do you mean?\"\n[“There was a human who made a proposition to me. I found it intriguing, so I generously accepted it. That human offered the memories and emotions of a person named Kim Dal-bi in exchange. It wasn’t much to me, but it seemed entertaining, so I agreed to the contract.”]\nThere was a human who had orchestrated the contract between the Goblin King and Kim Dal-bi.\n\"Who was this person who made the offer?\"\n[“I don’t know. I’m not interested in human affairs. But why should I be telling you this?”]\n\"You don’t need to know why. Just answer the question. Describe the appearance of that human thoroughly.\"\nCrack!!\nGolden Ram’s eyes flashed, and numerous fractures appeared around her.\nThe Goblin King frowned, and his guards immediately took up battle stances.\nThis was not the world where Woo-jin had received his powers, so Golden Ram's abilities could be fully unleashed here.\nGolden Ram glared at the Goblin King and spoke.\n\"My questions aren’t requests—they’re demands.\"\n[…….]\n\"Fix the price for using Kim Dal-bi’s power and answer my question. I won’t repeat myself.\"\nThe Goblin King's lips curled into a smile.\n[“What makes that human so important that someone like you would go so far as to overturn our contract? You and I both know how sacred and binding contracts are.”]\n\"She’s someone I care about.\"\n[“I see… That’s a clear and simple reason.”]\nThe Goblin King rose from his throne.\nWhoosh!\nAs he extended his arm to the side, a magical club appeared in his hand.\n[“If you defeat me, I’ll do as you ask. However, if I win, you must grant my request.”]\n\"You’re a cocky brat.\"\nGolden Ram smiled, and the Goblin King's face filled with excitement.\n[“It’s been a while since I’ve had such entertainment…!”]\nImmediately, magic clashed, and Golden Ram and the Goblin King engaged in battle.\n……\nNear the Zero Zone\nAn Woo-jin, after confessing his feelings to Oh Baek-seo, took advantage of her momentary confusion to make a request. He asked her to take Kim Dal-bi to her home and hide her.\nHe briefly explained that Dal-bi was in a state of magic depletion and wouldn’t pose a threat.\nWoo-jin had expected to need some persuasion, even with Baek-seo, as it was unreasonable for the head of the disciplinary committee to ask her to hide a notorious criminal.\nHowever, Baek-seo quickly composed herself and complied with the request. In fact, she had already been considering hiding Dal-bi herself.\nGiven how much the situation had escalated, it wouldn’t be surprising if something happened to Dal-bi in the near future.\nBaek-seo’s swift compliance left Woo-jin more surprised than anything else.\n—\"Before you go, let me ask you something.\"\n—\"What is it?\"\n—\"Did you find anything at the hideout?\"\nBaek-seo shook her head.\n—\"So you came straight for me… I see. Check it out later if you can.\"\n—\"I will.\"\nBaek-seo took Dal-bi and left.\nShortly after, the disciplinary committee arrived on the scene.\nHa Ye-song led the committee members into the Zero Zone, while Park Min-hyuk and the recovery team took care of Woo-jin.\nThe devastated Zero Zone.\nWoo-jin, covered in wounds.\nAnyone could tell that a fierce battle had taken place here.\nMin-hyuk loaded Woo-jin into a vehicle and immediately began channeling healing magic to restore him.\nThe disciplinary committee vehicle headed towards the hospital.\nScreech!\n—\"Stop right there!\"\nPolice academy vehicles blocked the road, preventing the Ahseong High School disciplinary committee from proceeding.\nWoo-jin, half-conscious, watched with blurred vision as the disciplinary committee and the police academy argued. Their voices reached his ears in disjointed fragments.\nOne thing was clear.\nThe police academy had realized that a major incident had occurred and wanted to take custody of Woo-jin for investigation.\nSince the Zero Zone was a neutral area under their jurisdiction, they had a valid reason.\nWoo-jin, despite Min-hyuk’s protests, insisted that he was fine and walked over to the police academy on his own. Min-hyuk couldn’t understand Woo-jin’s intentions, but Woo-jin reassured him that it was alright.\nAnd so, the police academy took Woo-jin into custody, treated him, and then placed him in detention.\n……\nAt Oh Baek-seo’s House\n\"Ugh…\"\nKim Dal-bi groaned in pain as she slowly opened her eyes.\nShe felt a soft, warm sensation beneath her.\nIt didn’t take long for her to realize that she wasn’t in a hospital bed but on a clean, comfortable bed.\n\"You're awake?\"\n\"!\"\nStartled by the gentle voice, Dal-bi flinched.\nThe voice belonged to Oh Baek-seo, who was standing by the kitchen, ladling warm soup into a bowl on a tray before approaching Dal-bi.\n\"Baek-seo…?\"\n\"Yes, it’s me.\"\n\"Can you not refer to yourself in the third person…? But what’s going on? Why am I here?\"\nDal-bi was clearly confused.\nBaek-seo placed the tray on a nearby cabinet and sat down in the chair next to the bed.\n\"The President gave me instructions.\"\n\"The President? The head of the disciplinary committee at Ahseong High?\"\n\"Yes, An Woo-jin.\"\n\"Why would he…?\"\n\"He said you saved him. He also mentioned that you were the one who gave him that peony flower, just like you did for me.\"\n\"……?\"\nBaek-seo didn’t miss the look of confusion that crossed Dal-bi’s face.\n\"…Do you remember who the President is?\"\nBaek-seo recalled how Dal-bi had completely forgotten about the promise they made in childhood. In fact, she had forgotten all their childhood memories.\nHowever, it wasn’t like amnesia, where all memory was lost. Rather, it seemed that specific memories had been erased, leaving gaps in her recollection.\nBaek-seo suspected that this memory loss was a result of the price Dal-bi had to pay for using her unique ability.\n\"Haha… I really have no idea what’s going on.\"\n\"That doesn’t matter. Do you remember Woo-jin?\"\nDal-bi thought for a moment before lowering her head.\n\"The boy I saw at the hospital earlier? The one with the teal-colored magic in his eyes…\"\n\"I don’t know about the hospital, but yes, that’s him.\"\n\"This is confusing.\"\nDal-bi gave Baek-seo a meaningful look and smiled slightly.\n\"Are you and I really on speaking terms like this?\"\n\"…….\"\nAn uneasy silence filled the room.\nBaek-seo studied Dal-bi’s expression.\nThere was a hint of wariness.\nAs if she was prepared to fight at any moment.\nRecently, they had been allies, fighting together. But this reaction was unnaturally distant.\nHad she lost her memories again?\n\"Hmm.\"\nSeeing no reason to hide the truth, Baek-seo swallowed her anxiety and spoke up.\n\"If I’m not mistaken… we had agreed to fight together, didn’t we?\"\n\"Us?\"\nDal-bi clicked her tongue.\nShe seemed incredulous.\nBaek-seo quietly observed the changes in Dal-bi’s expression.\n\"You definitely left me behind, didn’t you? And now you’re somehow the vice president of the disciplinary committee at Ahseong High, and the other day you even tried to…! Ah.\"\nDal-bi’s words trailed off.\nShe was bandaged all over.\nHer magic was depleted.\nHer entire body ached.\nBaek-seo was taking care of her.\nWoo-jin, who had said she was someone precious to him.\nAnd… the countless gaps in her memory.\nWith all these clues right in front of her, even a fool could piece together what had happened.\nDal-bi pressed her hand against her forehead and bowed her head. Her eyes spun in confusion.\n\"I must have forgotten something again… What happened between us…?\"\n\"Shh.\"\nBaek-seo placed her hand over Dal-bi’s.\n\"Calm down. I’ll explain everything slowly.\"\n\"…….\"\nDal-bi nodded slightly.\nBaek-seo took her time, patiently explaining everything that had happened between them.\nTheir childhood memories.\nTheir arguments.\nHow they had resolved their misunderstandings and decided to work together.\nBaek-seo’s gentle voice filled the quiet room.\nAs Dal-bi responded occasionally, Baek-seo could infer where the gaps in her memory were. She provided more detailed and supplementary explanations for those parts.\n\"So it was… a misunderstanding. That’s why we ended up parting ways…\"\nWas Baek-seo lying?\nNo.\nIf Baek-seo wasn’t telling the truth, she wouldn’t have approached her in such a friendly manner.\nBaek-seo stood up and helped Dal-bi lie back down.\n\"…Rest for now. Take your time to process everything.\"\n\"Did we really reconcile?\"\n\"I don’t know if ‘reconcile’ is the right word, but we resolved our misunderstanding. I hope you can think of it in a positive light.\"\nBaek-seo smiled warmly at Dal-bi, who was lying down.\n\"I accepted it in a positive way.\"\nDal-bi stared blankly at Baek-seo.\nBzzz.\nSuddenly, Baek-seo’s smartphone vibrated in her pocket. She answered the call.\n\"Yes. What’s going on?\"\n—\"Vice President! I don’t know what mission you’re on, but the President has just…!\"\nPark Min-hyuk’s urgent voice came through the phone, explaining that Woo-jin had been taken into custody by the police academy. As he spoke, Baek-seo’s eyes narrowed.",

      "content": "\"What on earth... What happened here?\"\nIt was dawn in the Zero Zone.\nInvestigators from the Police Academy, clad in their uniforms, had arrived at the scene. Their purpose was to conduct an investigation.\nGenerally, public zones are primarily secured by the Police Academy.\nHowever, the Zero Zone was a restricted area under the Principal's direct orders, meaning not only could they not secure it, but they were also forbidden from even entering.\nBut this time was different.\nA massive battle had taken place in the Zero Zone, prompting the Police Academy to swiftly decide to initiate an investigation.\nThe Zero Zone was considered a dangerous area.\nThus, the investigators dispatched were all highly skilled individuals.\n\"Good grief...\"\nThe investigators were left speechless as soon as they arrived at the scene.\nThe area was as large as a small city. Seeing such a vast zone reduced to ruins overnight was nothing short of terrifying.\n\"Are you telling me the Student Council President of Ahseong High School did all this?\"\nHow could that even be possible?\nThe idea that a single person could obliterate such a large area in just one night was beyond comprehension.\n\"Even if he fought against the Gluttonous Twin, could this really be possible?\"\nIt had become public knowledge through the investigation that the one who turned the Zero Zone into a wasteland was An Woo-jin, the Student Council President of Ahseong High School. He had cooperated fully, giving a detailed account of the incident.\nHowever, no matter how one looked at it, the scene defied logic.\n\"Do the Student Council Presidents of major academies normally do this kind of thing?\"\n\"Of course not. Stop talking and focus on the investigation.\"\n\"But seriously... Wasn't the Ahseong High Student Council President just a 4th-tier until last semester? I remember watching a live broadcast when he fought Shinso!\"\n\"There were rumors that he awakened his Unique Ability. He’s probably at least 5th-tier by now.\"\n\"5th-tier? But even so, this is...\"\n\"I know.\"\nThe senior investigator wiped the sweat from his brow.\n\"This is the result of someone who has reached the 7th-tier.\"\nThe 7th-tier, a level where a Unique Ability becomes nothing short of a disaster.\nIf a 5th-tier is considered a genius and a 6th-tier a monster, then a 7th-tier is akin to a walking natural disaster.\nThis is no exaggeration.\nThe proof was right in front of the investigators.\n\"As far as I know, there are only two people in this city who have reached the 7th-tier or higher. One is Goliath, and the other is the strongest among the Spartoi. I don’t know their names or abilities.\"\n\"But... Both of them are considered urban legends, right? I don’t get it... This is just too...\"\n\"Do you think I understand it any better? The fact that someone who was just a 4th-tier last semester has become comparable to those two?\"\n\"Could it be that something like a meridian has opened up? Like in martial arts novels. You know, how someone destined to be a monster appears weaker because they require so much experience to grow. I mean, there were already rumors that the Ahseong High Student Council President was extraordinarily strong for a 4th-tier. And wasn't he the one who took down the Necromancer and the Technomancer among the Six Sinners?\"\nThe senior investigator let out a sigh.\n\"Sigh, I don’t know. If the Ahseong High Student Council President has really reached the 7th-tier, I have no idea what’s going to happen next or if we can even handle it... Let’s just focus on our job for now. We can be shocked after the conclusion is reached.\"\n\"Y-yes, sir...!\"\nThe investigators quickened their pace.\nThey headed towards the abandoned hospital that Woo-jin had mentioned in his testimony.\nThen, they stopped in their tracks.\n\"What the...?\"\nThere were two areas that were strangely intact.\nA very small portion of the ground.\nAnd the abandoned hospital.\nThese clues left the investigators astonished.\nThe fact that the destruction of the Zero Zone wasn’t just the result of overwhelming brute force.\nBut rather, it was evidence that the devastation had been caused by a force that was\n'perfectly controlled.'\n\"This is insane...\"\nThe investigators were left in awe, pondering just how terrifying a Unique Ability could become at the level of a disaster, and what kind of being An Woo-jin, the Student Council President of Ahseong High, had turned into.\nThey could only mutter in amazement for some time.\n\"An order to cease all activities?\"\nIn the Student Council Office of Ahseong High School.\nA notice had arrived from the Hanyang Federation Academy.\nHa Ye-song, who had read the notice belatedly, couldn’t contain her shock.\n\"Until the issue of excessive self-defense is resolved? Baek-seo is to be treated as the acting Student Council President in the meantime? Does this mean the President can’t be the Student Council President anymore!?\"\n\"Since there’s a time limit, it just means he can’t perform his duties for a while. He’s still holding the position.\"\n\"But... For how long!?\"\nPark Min-hyuk, with a trembling voice, answered as he rubbed his forehead.\n\"I don’t know... Once the Police Academy completes their investigation, they’ll hand the case over to the Prosecution Department of the Trial Academy. Given the seriousness of the incident, it’s almost certain he’ll be indicted, and then the President will remain a defendant until a final verdict is reached... Even without that notice, he wouldn’t be able to act. He’s already been detained. It seems like this notice is just a warning for us not to do anything rash.\"\n\"Great, that’s really encouraging!\"\nYe-song snapped back, her tone dripping with sarcasm.\n\"But that’s the reality...\"\n\"Shut up! What did the President do wrong!? The Gluttonous Twin was the one who tried to kill him first, and the President only fought back!\"\n\"But it’s still considered homicide...\"\nAn Woo-jin was facing charges of murder in connection with the recent incident involving the Gluttonous Twin.\nHowever, given that the Gluttonous Twin had first attempted to kill Woo-jin, and that Woo-jin had retaliated in his capacity as the Student Council President, the primary issue was whether the act constituted excessive self-defense.\n\"If we can prove that the Gluttonous Twin was too strong and that Woo-jin had no choice, we might be fine... But in the worst case, the charges could be changed to murder or manslaughter. That would be dangerous.\"\n\"Ugh! Stop saying such ominous things! Don’t you know what self-defense is!? Are you trying to argue with me?\"\nMin-hyuk shook his head.\n\"If they determine that he could have subdued him without lethal force, then it won’t be recognized as self-defense. You know how hard it is to get self-defense recognized.\"\n\"I don’t care! No way... The Gluttonous Twin was planning to kill the President with an immensely powerful magical technique, right? The President had no choice but to kill him in self-defense! How could this not be considered self-defense...!\"\n\"And that’s why self-defense is so controversial... The precedents left by judges before they were replaced by AI have made it that way...\"\n\"The law is a mess! Were the judges planning to learn this lesson only after experiencing it themselves? Wait a minute. What have you been looking at this whole time?\"\nMin-hyuk was wearing glasses and intently reading through some documents.\n\"Just some legal texts and precedents. I pulled out everything I could find. I’m trying to see if there’s any way to help the President.\"\n\"Isn’t that the Defense Department’s job? The Chairman already hired a top firm.\"\nEach academy had its own Defense Department, a specialized club of students who studied law and acted as defense attorneys.\nThese clubs usually operated like businesses, and because the major academies were so large, it was easy to set up offices, often located near the Trial Academy.\n\"I just want to see if there’s anything we can do... I feel so anxious. I’m trying to memorize what I can in case it helps with this or any future cases.\"\n\"Min-hyuk, you must have been really pissed off yesterday...\"\nMin-hyuk appeared calm, but he was deeply frustrated.\nIt was because of what had happened the previous night when the Police Academy suddenly blocked the Student Council’s vehicle and demanded that Woo-jin be handed over, leading to a heated argument.\nMin-hyuk had threatened the Police Academy.\nHe argued that the President wasn’t at risk of destroying evidence or fleeing, so there was no reason for an emergency arrest. Without an arrest warrant, they had no grounds to take him. He insisted they needed to go to the hospital first.\nYet in the end, Woo-jin had patted Min-hyuk on the shoulder and surrendered to the Police Academy on his own.\nClearly, Woo-jin had made that choice out of concern for Min-hyuk and the rest of the Student Council, but Min-hyuk was left feeling powerless and frustrated.\n\"What are you reading? Want to take a look?\"\nMin-hyuk waved the documents towards Ye-song, who quickly shook her head and backed away.\n\"Just looking at legal jargon gives me hives and makes me nauseous. It’s like an allergy...\"\n\"That’s a strange allergy...\"\n\"Anyway, does this mean the President has to stay locked up until the trial?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nAt that moment, Oh Baek-seo emerged from the pantry and answered in his place. She handed tea to both Min-hyuk and Ye-song.\n\"Oh, thank you.\"\n\"Thanks. So, Baek-seo, does this mean we have to apply for visitation to see the President now?\"\nBaek-seo sat down gently on the sofa.\n\"I think so. I plan to apply as soon as visits are allowed.\"\n\"Can’t we do it now?\"\n\"Only the Defense Department student handling the case can visit for now. He’s being held in a special management prison.\"\n\"This is insane... The President didn’t do anything wrong...\"\n\"By the way, I have something to tell you.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nFor the first time since becoming an officer, Baek-seo’s expression was solemn.\nMin-hyuk and Ye-song exchanged worried glances.\n\"What’s wrong, Baek-seo? You look really serious...\"\n\"Can you call Do-ha? There’s something I need to say.\"\n\"Do-ha? Sure, but what do you need to say...?\"\n\"I think it’s time to reveal it. For the President’s sake, I have to say it now. It’s about me and the President.\"\nMin-hyuk and Ye-song exchanged puzzled looks.\nAhseong High Underground Detention Center.\nIn the underground where Moon Chae-yeon was confined.\n\"I want pizza! Pizza! What if I die from stress here?!\"\nChae-yeon was causing a commotion in a playful voice.\nThe Student Council members on guard duty scowled and gritted their teeth, doing their best to ignore her.\n\"Pizza, pizza! Special Shrimp Cheese Pizza! Garlic Steak Cheese Fondue Pizza! Basil Cheese Cube Pizza! Gorgonzola Pizza!\"\nAs Chae-yeon listed off various pizzas, testing the patience of the Student Council members on duty.\nBzzzzz.\nThe door beyond the barrier opened, and a student appeared.\n\"Huh?\"\nChae-yeon stopped her antics and looked at the newcomer. Her eyes soon widened in surprise.\nThe visitor was none other than Oh Baek-seo.",

      "content": "Police Academy, Special Management Detention Center.\nConsidering the danger posed by An Woo-jin, he was being held under the highest level of restraint.\nHis treatment had already been completed. Despite being in a state of mana depletion, Woo-jin’s monstrous recovery speed meant that he didn’t require an extensive treatment process.\nSince it was presumed that he had already reached the 7th-tier, he was now treated like a ticking time bomb that could go off at any moment.\nThe Police Academy hoped that, just as Woo-jin had cooperated with the investigation, he would continue to comply with the system and quietly await his trial.\nIn the control room, the special detention center was being monitored via CCTV. The cell where Woo-jin was being held was under particular scrutiny.\nTo the Police Academy students watching, Woo-jin seemed to be quietly passing the time.\nHowever, the CCTV couldn’t capture sound, which was a drawback.\n\"Yes.\"\nInside the highest-level special prison, Woo-jin, dressed in a full-body restraint suit, spoke with his head bowed so that his lips wouldn’t be visible on the CCTV.\nHe was using a tiny crack in his ear to communicate with Geumyang.\nNormally, when mana is depleted, it takes a significant amount of time to recover.\nBut Woo-jin had already recovered enough mana that even repeated spatial leaps by Geumyang wouldn’t be a problem. Thanks to reaching the 7th-tier, his mana recovery speed had greatly increased.\n\"So, they’re framing me, right?\"\n─\nThat’s right. The situation is turning against you. Are you really planning to stay here until your mana is fully recovered?\n\"They’ve already made their move.\"\nWoo-jin recalled the Gluttonous Twin’s ultimate magic.\n\"From now on, they’ll target me at a level far beyond anything I’ve faced before. I defeated the Gluttonous Twin and became much stronger than they anticipated. So... at the very least, I need to make sure they don’t target my people.\"\nWoo-jin had voluntarily allowed himself to be captured by the Police Academy, hoping that the Principal wouldn’t harm the Ahseong High Student Council.\n─\nIs that camaraderie I hear? You once said you became the Student Council President because you needed the power of the Council, but now you’re trying to protect them... What an irony.\nProtecting the Student Council.\nBecause within that group were his lover, his friends, and his subordinates.\n\"Didn’t I tell you before? I didn’t know the Principal would be such an irritating opponent, nor did I expect to gain so much power.\"\n─\nI know, I know. You little rascal. But does your opinion really matter? It seems the Student Council is planning to fight for you.\n\"What?\"\nWoo-jin narrowed his eyes and looked to the left, where the crack in his left ear was.\n─\nI checked with Ahseong High. It seems they’re planning to come here. And from what I can tell, they’re quite serious. Their goal is obviously you.\n\"Are you out of your mind? Are they planning to start a war with the academy?\"\n─\nThey requested that the Police Academy conduct your investigation without detaining you, but they were refused. So now Ahseong High is prepared to use force, and the Police Academy is on high alert. The public is in an uproar. It’s going to be a mess.\n......\nWoo-jin pondered this.\nIt was an unexpected turn of events.\n─\nWhat are you going to do? Things are about to get out of hand. Are you planning to escape?\n\"I’ll have to. ...But first.\"\nWoo-jin lifted his head.\nHis teal eyes glowed with a chilling light.\n\"Someone’s here.\"\nHaving reached the 7th-tier, his ability to sense mana had become even more refined.\nAt this moment, he began to sense the presence of a powerful individual he had never felt before.\n\"I’ll have to move up my plans.\"\nWoo-jin could roughly guess what was about to happen.\nHe decided to prepare.\nMeanwhile, in front of the Police Academy’s detention campus.\nThe Police Academy’s detention facilities were located far from the campus for management and efficiency.\nThis was the detention campus, where they sought to balance punishment and reform, focusing on the education of criminals. A detention center was also located here.\n\"It’s the Spartoi....\"\nA lethargic voice.\nEyes half-open as if everything was a chore.\nA man with deep eye shadows and a turtle-like neck sat in a car entering the detention center. The driver was another Spartoi.\nBoth were dressed in white uniforms. Spartoi wore this uniform whenever they carried out public activities.\nOnly a few knew this fact.\nThe information was tightly controlled.\nSo to the public, it just looked like the uniform of one of the many academies in the city.\nA senior student was waiting to greet the Spartoi. He was the warden.\n\"You’ve arrived. I’ve been informed of the situation. Please, come inside.\"\nThe warden had received instructions directly from the Principal.\nCurrently, with all the criminal allegations surrounding Woo-jin coming to light, it seemed the Principal was concerned, or so the warden believed.\n‘A chance to get in the Principal’s good graces...!’\nHe saw a path to promotion.\n\"It’s just a favor, secretly allowing a visit... Why would you bring the warden into this? This is quite overboard... It’s burdensome.\"\n\"Haha....\"\nThe Spartoi parked the vehicle in the parking lot. Then, only the man with dark circles under his eyes got out. He wore a long coat over his uniform.\nHe and the warden headed toward the special prison.\n\"So, the Ahseong High Student Council President is here...? The facility is pretty nice....\"\n\"Yes. This is a facility equipped with the most advanced restraint functions. Given how strong the Ahseong High Student Council President is, we had no choice but to keep him under the highest level of security. He understood this as well.\"\n\"Indeed. If I were thoroughly restrained in a place like this, I’d find it hard to use my strength....\"\n\"This is the finest restraint facility where no criminal can escape! The escape rate is zero! It’s one of the Police Academy’s proudest achievements.\"\nThe warden rubbed his hands together, promoting the facility’s advantages like a salesman. But the Spartoi remained unresponsive.\nThey arrived at a long corridor.\n\"If you go straight ahead, you’ll find the Ahseong High Student Council President. Unfortunately, due to his special restraint, we cannot bring him to the visitation room. I hope you understand.\"\n\"By the way, how many personnel do you have here?\"\n\"What? There are about six staff members here....\"\nThud!\n\"Huh?\"\nThe warden felt a searing pain in his abdomen. When he looked down, his vision was filled with an unbelievable sight.\nThe Spartoi’s hand held a knife that had pierced his stomach.\n\"Wh-why...?\"\n\"Today, a blemish will be made on your precious zero escape rate....\"\nThe Spartoi whispered in the warden’s ear, who was now in a state of confusion.\n\"You were killed by the escapee An Woo-jin. Understand...? Remember it well...?\"\nThud!\nThud!\nAnother quick slash from the knife deeply cut the warden’s throat. He fell lifeless to the ground.\nShhhh!\nThe Spartoi’s uniform vibrated briefly, shaking off the bloodstains into the air. This was one of the features of the Spartoi’s uniform.\nThe Spartoi then quickly pushed off the ground several times and disappeared from the spot.\nHe arrived at the control room.\n\"Huh?\"\nThe Spartoi was surprised.\nThe staff inside were all collapsed.\n‘What happened...? They seem to have been knocked out... Someone else must have secretly infiltrated the control room before me.’\nAfter confirming the condition of the staff, the Spartoi looked up. Multiple CCTV screens were transmitting images in the control room.\n‘The purpose is obvious.’\nOn the CCTV screen.\nThe face that should have been there was missing.\n\"Haha....\"\nThe Spartoi let out a chuckle.\n\"The Ahseong High Student Council President... I came to help you escape, but it seems you’ve already made your move.\"\nThere was no sign of An Woo-jin on the screen.\nOnly the broken pieces of his restraint suit scattered across the floor of the empty cell.\n\"Knocking them out was likely to buy time and delay the alert....\"\nThe Spartoi stroked his chin thoughtfully, then smiled.\nAnd then.\nThud!\nThud!\nHe quickly moved, half-severing the throats of the unconscious staff members. With that, the knocked-out staff members were now all dead.\nShhhh!\nHis uniform vibrated, shaking off the bloodstains.\nThe Spartoi skillfully twirled the bloodied dagger and manipulated the control room’s equipment, erasing the CCTV recordings from Woo-jin’s cell.\nSince the time stamps on the footage didn’t match the deaths of the Police Academy students, he erased the evidence.\n\"This should be enough to frame him.... Should I be grateful that my work got easier... Or maybe not....\"\n\"This should be enough to frame him... Should I be grateful that my work got easier... Or maybe not...\"\nThe Spartoi scratched his head.\n\"They say he's really strong... I was hoping to have a chance to fight someone who just reached the 7th-tier. What a shame... Well then.\"\nWhip!\nThe Spartoi quickly propelled himself forward, moving at an astonishing speed, as if teleporting, until he reached the corridor where he had been just moments before.\nThe warden's corpse lay sprawled on the ground.\nThe Spartoi pulled out a communicator from his coat pocket.\n\"A variable has occurred. The target has already escaped. However, I judge that there will be no impact on the overall plan. Continuing with the operation.\"\n─\nAcknowledged.\nAfter completing his report, the Spartoi cut himself with a knife, then repeatedly struck his own face with his mana-infused fists.\nThud! Thud!\n\"Ouch... Alright, I'm ready... Now, I just need to wait about ten minutes before reporting the situation...\"\nHiss...\nThe dagger used to kill the Police Academy students dissolved into smoke and disappeared.\nThe Spartoi planned to wait for ten minutes and then pretend to have \"regained consciousness\" as he used the warden's radio to report the current situation.\nHe would report that the Ahseong High Student Council President had killed the Police Academy students and escaped.\nThat he was lucky to have survived.\nThe Spartoi sneered as he leaned back against the wall.\n\"So anticlimactic...\"\nAt that moment.\n\"What have you done?\"\n\"!?\"\nA voice he hadn’t expected echoed through the corridor.\nThe overwhelming mana pressure that accompanied it caused the Spartoi’s eyes to widen in shock.\nInstinctively, the Spartoi generated a pair of daggers in his hands, gripping them tightly.\nIn that instant, a pair of teal eyes locked onto him. The sheer terror they exuded sent his instincts into overdrive.\nThe man who had suddenly appeared right in front of him, dressed in a tattered black uniform, was none other than An Woo-jin, the Ahseong High Student Council President.\nWham!!\nAt that moment, something sliced through the air.\nIt was a black, three-section staff wrapped in teal-colored lightning—Cheolryonggon.\nA weapon that had been confiscated and stored in the warehouse.\nWoo-jin had secretly retrieved it.\nThe Spartoi couldn’t choose the option to \"counterattack.\" The overwhelming pressure had paralyzed him.\nIn the end, the Spartoi’s instincts opted for \"defense.\"\nAs he crossed his twin daggers to block, the Cheolryonggon infused with Woo-jin's mana shattered them both at the blades.\nThe weapon then struck the Spartoi directly in the middle of his face.",

The sheer force of it caused the walls to crumble.\nBlood splattered, and the wall the Spartoi had leaned against formed a deep crater. His nose was shattered, and the center of his face caved in, bleeding profusely.\nHis hand groped the air in front of his deformed, unrecognizable face.\n\"Urgh, ugh...!\"\nThe Spartoi groaned in pain.\nWoo-jin’s cold gaze bore into him.\nWithout a moment’s pause, another series of blows rained down.\nIn a desperate attempt to escape, the Spartoi pushed off the ground rapidly several times, moving as if teleporting away from the spot.\nHe fled in terror.\n‘No, no, no!! I can’t win, I can’t win...!’\nThe Spartoi had completely lost his will to fight.\nHe had already realized it the moment he locked eyes with Woo-jin, or perhaps even earlier, when Woo-jin's mana touched his skin.\nHe was now fully aware of just how monstrously powerful the Student Council President was.\nHe had underestimated him, thinking he was just someone who had only recently reached the 7th-tier.\nThe Spartoi himself was a 6th-tier, considered a strong figure in Neo Seoul, and had undergone countless combat training as a Spartoi.\nBut no matter how he used his unique ability, no matter how much mana he poured into it, he knew he wouldn’t be able to match this monster’s power—not even by a fraction.\nCrack!\n\"Ugh!\"\nEven though he was fleeing at a speed that was impossible to follow with the naked eye, a crack suddenly appeared in the air, and in the blink of an eye, a heavy blow struck his torso.\nHis entire body was electrified, the shockwave spreading throughout him.\nBoom!!\nWith a sound like a cannon blast, the Spartoi’s body was hurled in the opposite direction, bouncing down the corridor like a skipping stone.\n\"Ah, ah...!\"\nNo matter how fast he was, it was meaningless in front of Woo-jin, who could traverse space as he wished.\nClick, click.\nWoo-jin was walking toward him.\nThe distance between them closed in an instant.\nThe 7th-tier.\nA walking disaster.\nThat title wasn’t just for show.\nThe Spartoi couldn’t believe that Woo-jin had reached the 7th-tier in such a short time, starting from the 4th-tier.\nEven if it were true, he had thought that someone who had only just reached the 7th-tier might still be manageable in a fight.\nBut that wasn’t the case. The difference in basic physical enhancement alone was overwhelming.\nMoreover...\n‘He went from the 4th-tier to the 7th-tier in just a few months... I should’ve thought more conservatively about how insane this guy is...!’\nEven the legendary powerhouse, Goliath, hadn’t grown stronger this quickly.\nWhat on earth was this man?\n‘I have to report this...!’\nThe Spartoi used his remaining strength to try and pull out his communicator.\n‘The Ahseong High Student Council President... We might not even stand a chance against him, even if we bring in White...!’\nWoo-jin soon reached the Spartoi.\nCrack!\nWithout hesitation, a flurry of strikes shattered the Spartoi’s limbs and destroyed his sensory organs.\nIt was damage that no healer could reverse.\n\"Urgh, ugh....\"\nThe Spartoi lost consciousness in excruciating pain.\nHoping he would spend the rest of his life in torment, Woo-jin calmly walked out of the detention center.\n─ Ahseong High Student Council President escapes from the special detention center...! 7 Police Academy students, including the warden, dead; 1 civilian student critically injured...!\n─ The 7th-tier ‘Walking Disaster’ escapes...!

No magic can pass through...\nThe alarms blared throughout Neo Seoul.\nCitizens received emergency text alerts on their smartphones, notifying them of the declaration of martial law.\n\"An Woo-jin escaped, and now martial law...!? They’re saying martial law will only end if An Woo-jin is killed—what is this...?\"\nAhseong High Student Council President Han Baek-hyeon felt dizzy.\n\"It was an emergency declaration made under the Principal’s authority!

We can’t operate the Student Council under these circumstances, not unless we’re prepared to face the full force of Hanyang and the Spartoi.\"\nThe secretary, sweating profusely, read from a tablet PC.\nThe news that a man now considered a heinous criminal had killed Police Academy students and a civilian student before escaping had spread.\nOn top of that, he was a 7th-tier. A single person with power comparable to a natural disaster.\nThe emergency declaration of martial law by the Principal’s authority was seen as a logical step.\nAs a result, the public, now fearful, had no choice but to turn their backs on the Ahseong High Student Council President.\nAnd from now on, if the Student Council acted without authorization, it would be considered a violation of martial law, and they would have to engage in a battle they had no chance of winning.\nBaek-hyeon squeezed his eyes shut. It felt like he was trapped in a no-win situation.\nOut of habit, he tried to tug at his tie, but the tie he had already thrown away was no longer there.\nBaek-hyeon let out a sigh and muttered to himself.\n\"An Woo-jin, what are you thinking...?\"\nHe couldn’t believe that Woo-jin had killed innocent Police Academy students.\nIt was likely the work of higher-ups who were enemies of Woo-jin.\nBut regardless, the fact that Woo-jin had escaped was undeniable. This only made the situation more dire.\nBaek-hyeon couldn’t shake off his unease.\n\"Could that bastard be planning a coup all by himself...?\"\nWhat cannot be controlled by law operates on the logic of power.\nHis opponent was already someone who couldn’t be dealt with through legal means.\nBaek-hyeon had a foreboding feeling that Woo-jin might be planning to overturn the entire academy city.\nAt that moment, there was a frantic knock on the Student Council President’s office door.\n\"Come in.\"\nThe door burst open, and a student from the Student Council entered, bowing hastily. He shouted urgently.\n\"P-President! The Central Student Council Audit Division has suddenly arrived! They’re conducting a raid on the Student Council...!\"\n\"What...!?\"\nBaek-hyeon was stunned.\nA few minutes earlier.\nAhseong High Student Council meeting point.\n\"The President escaped!?\"\nWith the sudden declaration of martial law, the Student Council’s plan to forcibly retrieve Woo-jin lost all meaning.\nAfterward, as Oh Baek-seo relayed the information she had received from Han Baek-hyeon’s secretary to the officers, Ha Ye-song exclaimed in shock.\n\"There are 8 victims. 7 dead, 1 critically injured... 7 had their throats slashed, and 1 was beaten so badly they’re beyond recovery...?\"\nPark Min-hyuk, his face pale with fear, said as he checked the news on his smartphone.\n\"No, no, the President isn’t like that! Even if he acts cold, he’s a good person! He’s mentally strong, and...!\"\n\"Everyone here knows that.\"\nAs Ye-song passionately defended Woo-jin, Yoo Do-ha, arms crossed, responded with a serious expression.\n\"But the situation is clear.\"\n\"I know! It’s just so frustrating! It’s like this city is trying to kill the President no matter what...! Is there nothing we can do?\"\nThe Student Council officers understood that all of this was likely orchestrated by the Principal.\nThe problem was,\n\"How can we possibly turn the tide?\"\n\"There’s no immediate solution. Trying to change public opinion without any weapons is pointless, and we don’t have the power to overturn the situation. No matter what the President does, this city will see him as an enemy. That’s why he... probably escaped. He must have thought that resolving this through the logic of power was the only option.\"\n\"Argh! But that’s practically a coup! Whether he succeeds or fails, it’ll be a disaster! He’ll be branded as a traitor, with no hope of clearing his name! He’ll become a complete criminal! And yet, I can’t think of any other option, which is driving me crazy...!\"\n\"But if they’re pushing the President into a corner this desperately, it means they’re scared. There are a lot of unnatural elements in this situation. In fact, some people are already questioning what’s happening.\"\nDo-ha replied, checking the online reactions on his smartphone.\n\"Let’s stop worrying about things that don’t matter right now and focus on what we need to do.\"\nBaek-seo drew the attention of the other officers to herself.\n\"The President has escaped, and now the entire city is hunting him. So, what should we do?\"\n\"...We need to find him first.\"\n\"Yes. Right now, the President is probably trying to recover his mana. So, he’ll likely hide somewhere and focus on resting, right?\"\n\"Yes, probably.\"\n\"Where exactly?\"\n\"......\"\nThe Student Council officers pondered.\n\"What about the underground hideout we used when we fought the Technomancer last time... But that might not work since there’s an investigation record.\"\n\"Anywhere is fine. We just need to search everywhere...\"\nAt that moment, the door suddenly burst open, and students dressed in white uniforms walked in quickly. Except for the lead student, the others were carrying large boxes.\nThe Student Council’s attention turned toward them.\nThey were wearing the uniforms of the Hanyang Federation Academy.\nAnd then...\n\"The Central Student Council...?\"\nThe highest authority among all academies.\nThe badge of the Central Student Council was clearly visible.",

      "content": "“Begin.”\nRumble!\nAt the command of the student at the forefront, the students from Hanyang Academy spread out in unison, beginning to search the Discipline Committee’s territory.\nThey stormed into the Discipline Committee room, the offices of the committee officers, and other areas, indiscriminately shoving documents and items into boxes. The members of the Discipline Committee looked around in confusion.\nBaek-seo, her face now void of any smile, walked up to one of the Student Council members who was standing still and stopped in front of him.\n“What do you think you’re doing right now?”\n“Are you Deputy Head Baek-seo of Ahseong High School’s Discipline Committee? We are the audit team from the Hanyang Federal Academy Student Council. We’re here to conduct a search and seizure and to take custody of the Six Sinners.”\n“What...?”\n“Here are the search warrant and transfer authorization.”\nThe male student from Hanyang Academy handed an envelope containing the documents to Baek-seo. She immediately pulled out the papers and began reading them with the committee officers.\nSearch warrant. An official document outlining the authority to operate under martial law. Authorization for the transfer of the Six Sinners.\nAll the documents were finalized and signed by the Principal.\nThe basis for the warrant was fabricated evidence spread by the media, along with circumstances of serial murders and prison breaks.\nGiven the charges against An Woo-jin, it was determined that the Discipline Committee might destroy evidence to protect their own.\nThe documents showed that all locations associated with An Woo-jin were targets for search and seizure, and an emergency warrant was issued.\nHowever, Baek-seo read the documents differently.\nAhseong High School’s Discipline Committee, you better sit quietly and do nothing.\nYou are absolutely not allowed to abuse your power during martial law.\nThe pressure from the Principal... was palpable to Baek-seo.\nAnd now, even the transfer of the Six Sinners.\nIf this goes on, the only weapon Ahseong High has will be lost.\nIt was clear that the Principal was determined to prevent Ahseong High from helping An Woo-jin in any way.\n“A search and seizure... and now you want the Six Sinners too?”\nYe-song clicked her tongue in disbelief.\n“This is to investigate the case involving Discipline Committee Head An Woo-jin. The transfer of the Six Sinners is a forced measure, as it has been deemed that the Discipline Committee, which An Woo-jin belonged to, cannot be entrusted with the case. We ask for your cooperation.”\n“I... I can’t accept this...! This is too much...!”\nAs Ye-song tried to protest, the male student from Hanyang spoke in a stern tone.\n“If you resist, we will consider it an illegal riot under martial law. You will then have to face the martial law security forces, a combined organization of Hanyang Academy’s military and Spartoi.”\n“Gasp...!”\nYe-song shut her mouth tightly.\nNo matter how powerful Ahseong High’s Discipline Committee was, even they couldn’t stand against Hanyang Academy’s forces combined with Spartoi.\nAt that moment, Baek-seo’s smartphone vibrated. The caller was the Student Council President, Han Baek-hyun.\n“Excuse me, I need to take this.”\nBaek-seo stepped aside to take the call.\n“President. They’re conducting a search and seizure...”\n─ I know. I just heard.\n“What should we do?”\n─ The city is determined to bury An Woo-jin with fabricated evidence. There’s nothing we can do. We lack the authority, the power—everything. We’re objectively outmatched.\n“But we can’t just sit back and take this...”\n─ You think I want to do nothing? For now... endure it.\nBaek-seo closed her eyes, lowered her head, and took a deep breath.\nIn the end, the Hanyang Federal Academy Student Council completed their search and seizure of the Discipline Committee.\nThey also took Han Seo-jin and Moon Chae-yeon into custody and left Ahseong High.\nHowever, some of Hanyang’s students were left behind, under the pretext of monitoring the situation during martial law. All the necessary documents had been prepared to justify their presence.\nThey were under the protection of martial law.\nThe Discipline Committee of Ahseong High School was inevitably oppressed by this.\n...\nDrip, drip.\nWater was leaking from the ceiling.\nInside the Grey Star building, where Anomia had once kidnapped Park Min-hyuk.\nAn Woo-jin sat with his back against the wall in a room where the sunset poured in through a broken window.\nHe was still in his school uniform, covered in dust and dirt, with parts torn from the battle with the Gluttonous Twins, having had no time to regroup after being captured.\nThe city was swarming with a massive number of surveillance drones and androids.\nAll were martial law robots, and their target was Woo-jin.\nEven Hanyang Federal Academy and Spartoi had combined their forces to form the martial law security team, and they, too, were searching for Woo-jin.\nWoo-jin surveyed his surroundings.\nThe place was a wreck, practically a ruined building.\nNo, it was essentially a ruin.\nAfter being ravaged by Woo-jin and then raided by the investigation agencies, it hadn’t been maintained at all.\n“Life sure does have a way of turning things upside down, doesn’t it?”\nA girl with long golden hair, Geum-yang, dressed in the Ahseong High School uniform, approached and sat next to Woo-jin.\n“How does it feel to be treated like a villain, constantly hunted down, when you used to be the one chasing and capturing them?”\n“Not great. And since I’m being framed, there’s also the frustration of being wrongly accused.”\n“Are you planning to stay hidden until your magic recovers?”\nWoo-jin nodded.\n“I have to. One of the Spartoi members is at the 7th tier, and even if the others gang up on me, it would be hard to deal with. There are too many variables to consider. Acting recklessly in this state would be too risky.”\nWoo-jin gazed at the dim sunlight filtering through the broken window.\n“The city is crawling with Spartoi. If I run into just one of them, I’ll have to be prepared to fight the entire martial law security team. No matter how much I run, there’ll be a limit. If I overuse my magic, I’ll be stuck in a state of magical depletion for a long time.”\n“Are you planning to stay here until then?”\n“This place won’t hold out for long either. Martial law has just been declared, so I can buy some time now, but once Spartoi and the martial law robots spread out, it’ll be hard to hide anywhere.”\nIt was essentially a game of hide-and-seek in Neo Seoul.\nUntil his magic recovered, he couldn’t afford to make any reckless moves.\n“As a word of caution, you do have the ability to travel through space.”\n“They probably have magic-tracking devices. If they detect and measure my magic, they can pinpoint its location anywhere, anytime. And their coverage extends across the entire city. If I get caught, relying on space jumps alone to escape will quickly reach its limit. Anyway, I need to rest up and replenish my magic before things get worse.”\n“Hmm... Then even contacting the Discipline Committee would be dangerous. There’s no way they’re not monitoring them.”\n“Exactly.”\nThe conversation lapsed into silence.\n“But still, I’m glad you’re here with me.”\nWoo-jin spoke in a calm voice.\nGeum-yang gave him a mischievous look before smiling triumphantly.\n“Hmph. It’s only natural for me to stay by my subordinate’s side when they’re in danger.”\n“Don’t get too full of yourself.”\n“By the way, kid, how do you plan to prove your innocence? That guy in the central tower seems dead set on finishing you off. It’s probably impossible to sway public opinion. This city itself has practically become your enemy. Did you foresee this situation?”\n“I knew they’d use the most powerful means available. I expected they might declare martial law using their authority, but I didn’t think they’d go this far just to capture me. I didn’t expect to realize the weight of being at the 7th tier like this.”\nWoo-jin looked down at his hands.\n“...Kid.”\n“Yeah?”\n“What are you going to do once your magic recovers?”\n“I’m going to destroy everything.”\n“What exactly?”\n“Everything that prevents me from being free.”\n“What does freedom mean to you?”\nWoo-jin answered calmly.\n“A life where happiness is not permitted.”\nHe recalled Goliath’s words.\nThe struggle for rights is born from conflict.\nIf you don’t fight, you can’t win.\nTo gain freedom in this damned academy city, he had to fight.\n“Yeah... As long as your standards are clear.”\nGeum-yang said this as she leaned back against the wall, just like Woo-jin.\nFor a while, the two remained silent. Eventually, Woo-jin held his breath.\nHe sensed magic.\nGeum-yang noticed it too, and they exchanged glances. She put a finger to her lips, and Woo-jin nodded.\nHe quietly stood up and hid behind a pillar. Geum-yang created a rift in the air and returned to her labyrinth.\nClick, clack.\nThe sound of high heels grew closer, the footsteps confident, as if they had no intention of hiding their presence.\nThe magic was also approaching.\nNot bothering to conceal the flow of magic was almost an invitation for Woo-jin to lower his guard. So, he chose to hide and observe the situation.\nOf course, given the circumstances, Woo-jin had to remain on high alert instinctively.\nFinally, someone appeared.\nWoo-jin’s eyes widened in surprise.\n“Woo-jin-sunbae, are you there~?”\nWoo-jin narrowed his eyes and stepped out from behind the pillar.\n“Oh, I found you! Wow~. So this is where you were, sunbae!”\nA girl with long straight hair and narrow eyes.\n“Tada! It’s your beloved junior, Lee Se-ah, here to save the day!”\nLee Se-ah spread her hands out to the sides of her head, flashing a sly smile.\n“You... Why are you here? More importantly, how?”\n“Huh? Didn’t I tell you before? Finding people is my specialty. Anyway! It looked like you were in trouble, so I came. Aren’t you in a bit of a pinch?”\n“But...”\n“Didn’t I tell you before? I’m going to make you mine, sunbae.”\nThe setting sun that filtered through the broken window cast a line between Woo-jin and Se-ah.\nSe-ah tilted her head to the side.\n“So, I’ve come to help you. Better take my offer before I change my mind, okay?”",

      "content": "\"Where is this...?\"\n\"Tada! This is the secret bunker of our organization, Dohwa Group! Wow~, you’re the first outsider I’ve ever shown this to, Sunbae! Haha.\"\nAn Woo-jin arrived at a well-furnished bunker after riding in a vehicle belonging to the Dohwa Group. The bunker was cleverly concealed with camouflage on the mountainside.\nThere were two reasons Woo-jin had decided to ride in the Dohwa Group's vehicle.\nFirst, using space jumps repeatedly could expose him due to the magic energy that would be detected.\nSecond, the vehicle was equipped with a well-installed magic barrier, which prevented any magic from leaking out of the vehicle. Although it was far less sophisticated than the jammer at Central Tower, it effectively prevented Woo-jin’s magic from being detected.\n\"Welcome, Miss Se-ah!\"\n\"Miss Se-ah! And... welcome to you too, Head of the Discipline Committee at Ahseong High School.\"\nAs if they had been waiting, five members of the Dohwa Group greeted Woo-jin and Se-ah. They were all dressed in suits.\n\"You can trust these people. I brought them along because I needed security personnel. They all have a good opinion of you, Sunbae.\"\n\"I see...\"\nHowever, Woo-jin had no intention of trusting anyone. The only reason he had followed Se-ah was because of the help she had provided him in the past.\nHe simply needed a place to rest until he was back in top condition, and this location seemed perfect for that purpose.\nOf course, if the situation became dangerous, he planned to escape through a space jump.\n'But what does she mean by good opinion?'\nWoo-jin was aware that Se-ah harbored a desire to make him her subordinate, which she had hinted at in a previous conversation.\nIt seemed that Se-ah had been talking about him to her subordinates, like someone drinking the kimchi soup before the meal.\n\"Please follow me.\"\nSe-ah led Woo-jin through the bunker.\nIt was quite spacious.\n\"Sunbae, you need rest, don’t you?\"\n\"How did you know?\"\n\"You fought a major battle even before you were captured by the Police Academy, didn’t you? Also, the fact that you’ve reached the 7th tier has been revealed to everyone. For someone as strong as you, if you’ve just fought a big battle and aren’t doing anything, it’s obvious~. You need time to recover your magic, but with martial law declared and all sorts of forces targeting you, it’s hard to rest properly, right?\"\n\"So?\"\n\"I’m going to help you get some rest.\"\nThe two arrived at a bedroom.\n\"Feel free to make yourself comfortable. You can sleep if you like. I’ll wake you if anything happens.\"\nIf it were Baek-seo, Woo-jin might have considered it, but he thought it was too dangerous to trust someone else and fall asleep in the current situation.\n\"I appreciate the thought. But I got plenty of sleep while I was in the cell, so I’m fine.\"\n\"No need to refuse. Oh, are you hungry? Should I prepare a meal for you? We also have fresh clothes.\"\n\"No, it’s fine. Just providing a place to rest is enough.\"\nWoo-jin sat down on a chair, while Se-ah took a seat on the bed, creating a setting conducive to conversation.\nAfter a brief silence, Se-ah spoke first.\n\"Um... I won’t ask what’s going on. It seems you’re involved in something very complicated.\"\n\"Do you trust me?\"\n\"Yes. I know what kind of person you are, Sunbae. After all, we’re mutual stalkers, aren’t we?\"\n\"Mutual stalkers...? Well, whatever, that’s fine.\"\n\"You’re straightforward. If I were in your position, I’d probably be suspicious of everything in the world right now.\"\nWoo-jin stared intently at Se-ah.\n\"Well... let’s forget I asked for a response to that!\"\nSe-ah switched to a playful tone, avoiding the topic.\nAfter all, if she admitted to being suspicious, it would justify Woo-jin's own doubts about her.\n\"More importantly, Sunbae, what are you planning to do now? It seems like you’ve been falsely accused of quite a few things.\"\n\"You figured that out, huh?\"\n\"Of course. That’s why I’m helping you. Oh, by the way, did you know that they’re conducting a search and seizure at the Discipline Committee?\"\n\"A search and seizure? I expected as much...\"\nIt wasn’t surprising.\nGiven the circumstances, it was something that was bound to happen.\n\"Even if you recover your magic and cause a scene, it’ll only add to the charges against you.\"\n\"My comrades will handle that. I’ll do my part too, of course.\"\n\"Oh, camaraderie and trust? I like that! So, who are these comrades...?\"\nWoo-jin leaned back against the chair.\n\"The members of the Discipline Committee. It’s our duty to uncover the truth without falling victim to the tricks of criminals. We’re also the investigative agency of Ahseong High School.\"\n\"Right now, you’re being treated as the villain of this academy city, you know? The most dangerous one, considering martial law was declared just to deal with you.\"\n\"But you said you trust me.\"\n\"Of course.\"\n\"Then I should at least try to trust those who believe in me.\"\n\"...Why are you smiling?\"\nSe-ah was grinning from ear to ear, her reaction unusual enough to make Woo-jin frown.\n\"I like people who try to trust others. It makes you even more desirable, Sunbae~.\"\n\"Enough... Why did I even ask that...?\"\n\"By the way, Sunbae. Are you planning to go after the Principal once your magic is recovered?\"\nSe-ah’s question flowed naturally, but Woo-jin immediately sensed something off and paused.\n\"...?\"\nWoo-jin’s eyes narrowed. It wasn’t the kind of question one would ask so casually.\nSe-ah was still smiling slyly, which only heightened the sense of unease.\nWoo-jin spread his senses, trying to detect if there was anything hidden in the room. Enhancing his physical senses with 7th-tier magic allowed him to do so.\nHowever, there didn’t seem to be any hidden cameras or bugs.\n\"Is this room soundproof?\"\n\"Yes, it’s well soundproofed. After all, it’s a secret base.\"\n...Was he being too suspicious because of the situation?\nWoo-jin sighed, trying to calm his nerves.\n\"What kind of answer are you expecting from me?\"\n\"I’m just curious. Oh, you don’t have to answer if you don’t want to.\"\nThis conversational tactic—the way she shifted topics after sensing his discomfort—made Woo-jin uncertain.\nWas she being considerate, or was she harboring some intention and then retreating?\nWoo-jin found it difficult to fully trust Se-ah, even though he liked her.\n'In that case...'\nWoo-jin decided to ask a straightforward question.\n\"It feels odd to ask this now, but there’s something I’ve been meaning to ask.\"\n\"To me?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Wow~, I’m honored that you’re curious about something! Feel free to ask anything. I’m always on your side, Sunbae.\"\nSe-ah pointed to herself with her index finger, clearly pleased.\nWoo-jin leaned forward slightly, closing the distance between them.\n\"Why are you trying to take over the Black Market?\"\nIt was a question he had kept to himself until now.\nSe-ah’s stated goal was to become a “necessary evil” to create a “better world.”\nThat was likely her reason for trying to dominate the Black Market.\nWoo-jin had once secretly investigated the matter but had been unable to uncover any concrete evidence, such as transaction records. It seemed Se-ah was thoroughly prepared to avoid leaving any trace.\nHe had always wondered how the Dohwa Group could even attempt to take over the vast market of the Black Market. But if Se-ah’s intentions were good, Woo-jin didn’t intend to interfere.\nHowever, he was asking this now to determine whether Se-ah was truly someone he could trust.\n\"Um... Wow. That’s a pretty intense question... I wasn’t expecting that at all...\"\nSe-ah laughed awkwardly, scratching her cheek.\n\"I didn’t think you’d ask something like that. Although it’s not strange for you to know... How did you find out?\"\n\"There are ways to know.\"\nIt was knowledge from the original work.\nSomething that couldn’t be revealed through a simple investigation.\n\"Are you trying to avoid the question?\"\nSe-ah fell silent, her voice lowering slightly.\n\"Then why didn’t you arrest me?\"\n\"The Black Market is a neutral zone. It’s not under Ahseong High’s jurisdiction.\"\n\"But whatever I do in the Black Market would still violate Ahseong High’s rules, right? You have more than enough reason to take me in.\"\n\"Yeah... I could turn a blind eye to that. You’ve helped me a lot in the past. Besides, I don’t have any solid evidence against you. I’m not that inflexible. Just don’t commit any serious crimes like the Six Sinners.\"\nWoo-jin’s goal was to prevent the rise of a dystopia.\nHe didn’t intend to regard Se-ah as a clear enemy unless he was certain she would bring about such a future. He had simply been wary of the possibility that she might become a great evil.\nGiven her sincere dream and the actions she had taken, Woo-jin couldn’t help but want to believe in Se-ah.\n\"Wow... That’s not something I expected the Head of the Discipline Committee to say.\"\nSe-ah chuckled, placing her hand on the bed.\n\"But I’m relieved! To be honest, I was worried you might be too rigid, but this means we might see eye to eye someday, right?\"\n\"I’m not interested in the Black Market. As long as you don’t do anything foolish, I’m fine with you taking control of it. Someone’s going to dominate it anyway. It might as well be you.\"\n\"Sunbae, you’re making me want you even more. It’s like you’re getting more attractive by the minute.\"\nSe-ah said playfully.\n\"So? You still haven’t answered my question.\"\n\"I’ll tell you if you agree to join me.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Don’t look at me like that. It’s scary. But don’t worry. I have only good reasons. I just want to make a better world, and I don’t want to be at odds with you.\"\nSe-ah smiled.\n\"As I’ve said many times, I really like you, Sunbae. Why wouldn’t I like our Head of the Discipline Committee, who’s working to create a better world? Isn’t this just a case of like-minded people getting close?\"\n\"Is that so...\"\n\"...Oh, I’ve been keeping you for too long, haven’t I? I should go do some breathing exercises. Feel free to call me anytime you’re bored. Since martial law’s in effect, I have plenty of free time.\"\n\"Yeah, thanks.\"\n\"Make sure to use the shower if you want to freshen up.\"\nSe-ah smiled brightly and left the room.\nSoon, the room fell into silence.\nAfter a while, Woo-jin heard a faint crackling sound in his ear, forming a tiny fracture.\n─ Finally, she’s gone.\nFrom the fracture, Geum-yang’s voice echoed in Woo-jin’s ear.\n\"Geum-yang.\"\n─ What?\n\"Do you think that girl is trustworthy?\"\n─ No.\n\"Why not?\"\n─ She’s hiding too much. She seems sly as a snake.\n\"Hiding things...\"\nWoo-jin stared at the ceiling.\n\"Isn’t that true for both of us?\"\n─ True enough.\n\"By the way, I need a favor. Can you secretly keep an eye on this place and see if it’s trustworthy?\"\n─ Why should I bother with something so tedious?\n\"I’ll treat you to as much curry as you can eat when it’s all over.\"\n─ Surveillance is my specialty. Leave it to me! Hehe!\nThe crack disappeared, and silence returned.\nWoo-jin went to the bathroom to wash his face, then returned to his seat. He let out a long breath, settled into a comfortable position, and closed his eyes, allowing himself to drift into a light sleep.\nHe had a feeling this might be his last chance to rest.\nSo, he decided to take full advantage of it.\nAs he was resting, Se-ah reentered the room. It had been about two hours.\nCurious about what she would do, Woo-jin pretended to be asleep.\n\"Sleep well, Sunbae.\"\nSe-ah covered him with a blanket, adjusted his position for comfort, and then left the room again.\n...\n─ Kid, wake up.\nA few hours later.\nStill half-asleep, Woo-jin heard Geum-yang’s voice in his ear.\n\"I’m not asleep. What’s up?\"\nHis body felt more refreshed than before, but there was still a hint of drowsiness in his voice.\n─ Enemies are coming.",

Your group can't win against them.\"\n\"I know. But what can we do? We'll have to escape when we see an opening. We prepared an escape route just in case.\"\nEscape when they see an opening?\nAgainst Spartoi?\n\"......\"\nMemories from the original work flashed through Woo-jin's mind.\nSe-ah, after becoming the ruler of the Black Market and a major villain, met an untimely death under mysterious circumstances.\nGiven that the Dohwa Group was also wiped out, it was highly likely she had been assassinated by someone.\nWho exactly was responsible for Se-ah's and the Dohwa Group's demise was unclear.\nIt seemed most likely that rival criminal organizations, who were displeased with Se-ah's dominance over the Black Market, had joined forces against her... but something about that didn’t sit right.\nCould someone as meticulous as Se-ah really be taken down so easily?\nEspecially considering the magical power possessed by the members of the Dohwa Group, they were far from being weak.\nThis suggested that in the original work, Se-ah was likely defeated by a strong opponent who was unpredictable and highly skilled.\nAssassination seemed the most probable cause.\n'This situation is no exception.'\nWoo-jin had no way of knowing what kind of danger Se-ah might face as a result of hiding him.\nEspecially since the opponent was Spartoi.\nIf Se-ah died and the Dohwa Group was destroyed as in the original work, it would be a natural outcome.\nEven if he didn’t fully trust her, Se-ah was still a junior he liked. Woo-jin didn’t want to see her get hurt.\nMoreover, she had provided him with a place to rest, and now she was caught up in this crisis because of it.\nLeaving without doing anything would weigh heavily on his conscience.\n'Fortunately, my magic has almost fully recovered.'\nThat’s the 7th tier for you.\nHe hadn’t expected his magic to recover so quickly, even after being completely drained.\nAt this rate, he’d soon be at full strength.\nHe could afford to go head-to-head in a battle.\nWoo-jin approached Se-ah and stood in front of her. He then asked,\n\"Do you regret hiding me?\"\nSe-ah smiled mischievously and answered with innocent confidence.\n\"I’ve never regretted anything in my life!\"\n\"Good to hear.\"\nWoo-jin tried to pass by her.\n\"Sunbae.\"\nHe stopped.\n\"Are you planning to fight?\"\n\"......\"\n\"Don’t do anything strange.\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"Don’t say anything weird to the enemies, like you threatened our group to provide you a place to stay by using your relationship with me.\"\nSe-ah looked directly at Woo-jin, her expression firm, almost like a warning.\nWoo-jin chuckled softly.\n\"My junior really isn’t afraid to speak her mind. Let’s meet again. Stay safe.\"\nWoo-jin lightly tapped Se-ah on the shoulder as he walked past her.\nAs soon as he left the room, he created a rift in the air and jumped through it.\nHe intended to take out all the enemies before they could clash with the Dohwa Group and Spartoi.\nMeanwhile, in the forest, a squad of Spartoi was moving swiftly toward the secret base.\nThey held their breath and maintained a state of high alert.\nTheir target was An Woo-jin, a formidable opponent who had reached the 7th tier.\n\"Is this the place?\"\n\"Yes, it’s close.\"\nThey had identified a secret base somewhere in the mountains where Woo-jin might be hiding.\nAs Woo-jin's magic gradually recovered, the massive magic detection system spread throughout Neo Seoul had managed to pick up his energy.\nThe Spartoi dispatched for this mission knew they had little chance of defeating a 7th-tier powerhouse like Woo-jin.\nThere was no point in even thinking about how to counter his devastating lightning and spatial abilities—the gap in strength was simply too vast.\nTheir mission was to measure Woo-jin's magic accurately and relay that information to the martial law security forces.\nHowever...\n\"!\"\nA powerful wave of magic rippled through the trees, enveloping the Spartoi. They all stopped in their tracks, startled.\nSomething was coming.\nCrack!\nAt that moment, a rift formed among the Spartoi, and Woo-jin calmly stepped out of it.\nThey found themselves suddenly face-to-face with one of the most powerful figures in the world.\nAs black-ops specialists, the Spartoi were trained not to show emotion, but the fear on their faces was unmistakable.\n\"An Woo—!\"\nCrack!\nRifts formed around each Spartoi, surrounding them like a prison, giving them no time to counterattack.\nBoom!\nHigh-voltage lightning magic poured through the rifts, efficiently striking the enemies.\nThis was Woo-jin’s unique ability, spatial domination.\nMagical formula Type 2: Spatial Thunderclap.\nWithout even a chance to scream, the Spartoi fell to the ground, their bodies charred and smoking as the smell of burnt flesh filled the air.\nHowever, for new humans as strong as Spartoi, this wasn’t a fatal blow. They’d be out of commission for days, at most.\nUnless they were like the murderous Spartoi Woo-jin had encountered in prison, he had no desire to take their lives. He had the power to avoid doing so.\n\"Guh...!\"\nHe had left one of them conscious, attacking with just enough force to keep him awake. Woo-jin approached him, then pulled the magic detector attached to his belt and stood up.\nIt was a device that functioned like a phone, capable of transmitting information.\n\"So this is it. The device that measures my magic and sends it to the magic detector system.\"\n\"W-what are you going to do...?\"\nThe Spartoi rasped through blood-flecked coughs as Woo-jin infused his magic into the device. It beeped as his magic information was recorded.\nThen, Woo-jin pressed the send button.\n\"What...!?\"\nThe Spartoi’s eyes widened in shock.\n\"You...! What are you doing...!? By doing that, you’ve transmitted your magic information to the entire martial law security force. Now there’s nowhere left for you to hide...! Are you out of your mind...?\"\nFor the Spartoi, it was a stroke of luck, but the situation made no sense.\nNo matter where Woo-jin fled or hid, Neo Seoul would be able to find and attack him easily.\n\"I don’t know.\"\nAt that moment, the communication function on the device activated. Woo-jin looked at the screen.\n─ ...Ahseong High’s Discipline Committee Head.\nA cold voice, like ice, filled the air.\nWoo-jin recognized that voice.\n─ Was it you who sent this magic information?\nJudging by the tone, it seemed the other person, being a 7th-tier as well, had guessed what was happening and reached out.\nIt seemed they had been skeptical about whether the Spartoi squad would succeed.\nA faint smile tugged at the corners of Woo-jin’s lips.\nThe main reason he needed to recover his magic was now on the other end of this call.\n\"Suh Kang-jin, right? The top Spartoi. Codename 'White,' correct?\"\nIn this city, he was said to be the strongest after Goliath.\nThe Principal’s ultimate weapon.\nThe strongest among the Spartoi.\nSuh Kang-jin.\nThere was a brief silence after Woo-jin spoke, as if Kang-jin was processing the surprise.\n─ ...You know me.\nIt was astonishing that Woo-jin knew this top-secret information.\nThere was a hint of admiration in Kang-jin’s voice.\n\"Judging by your call, you must have figured out the situation. Am I right?\"\n─ …….\n\"I’ll take that as a yes. I’m not hiding anymore. I don’t need to...\"\nA clear sense of rage welled up within Woo-jin.\nHe bared his teeth, growling.\nA twisted, menacing expression crossed his face.\nThe Spartoi felt a shiver run down their spines, as if they could hear a beast growling in the distance.\n'Goliath...?'\nIt was reminiscent of the overwhelming pressure that always accompanied Goliath’s presence.\nAnd then, Woo-jin declared.\n\"I’m going to bring down the Principal.\"\nIt was a declaration of war.\nThe Spartoi’s eyes widened in shock.\n\"I’ll destroy anything that gets in my way, even if it’s this entire academy city. Stop me if you can.\"\nPure anger and hostility.\nA sigh, filled with disdain, came from Kang-jin.\n─ Then you’ll learn the hard way what arrogance brings. And... don’t expect any courtesy from me. Whatever fate befalls you, consider it well deserved. The price for defying the order of Neo Seoul will not be light.\nHis words made it clear that he intended to make Woo-jin's death as painful as possible.\nWoo-jin recalled the mind map he had seen at Baek-seo’s house. To her, Kang-jin was akin to a landmine, a powerful adversary.\nHe also remembered what the doctor had said during Baek-seo's treatment after the Moon Chae-yeon suppression operation. The doctor had noted several frostbite scars.\nFor Baek-seo, Kang-jin was not just a landmine; he was one of the few Spartoi who could easily overpower her.\nThe only person who could have caused such severe frostbite on Baek-seo was Suh Kang-jin.\nMoreover, he was the Principal's most loyal enforcer, someone who had faithfully carried out the Principal’s dirty work.\nIn a way, it was convenient.\nWoo-jin felt an intense desire to smash his fist into Kang-jin's face.\n\"You’re no different,\" Woo-jin replied.\n─ What?\n\"Whatever happens to you, consider it well deserved.\"\nBefore Kang-jin could respond, Woo-jin crushed the magic detector in his hand.\nCrack!\nThe device shattered, its fragments scattering to the ground. The sight was reflected in the widened eyes of the Spartoi.\nThud!\nWoo-jin's foot came crashing down on the head of the Spartoi, delivering a heavy blow that knocked him out cold, his face crumpling under the force.\nWith a cold expression, Woo-jin walked away.\nBy now, twilight had begun to settle over the land.",

      "content": "Principal Lee Doo-hee\nwas gazing out at the panorama of Neo Seoul from the Central Tower. The only difference from the usual scene was the faintly visible translucent barrier created by the jammer.\nThis was the pinnacle of Neo Seoul's technological prowess.\nThe barrier, charged with immense energy, blocked all forms of magic-based technology.\nIn other words,\nWoo-jin\ncouldn't leap through space to reach the Central Tower in an instant.\nMoreover, any magic-based technology would find it nearly impossible to damage the Central Tower.\nThough the tower was vulnerable to physical attacks, the waiting Spartoi and the air defense system would handle those.\nEven in the event of a crisis, there were plenty of emergency technologies prepared to bolster the tower's defenses.\nThe problem was...\n\"\nAn Woo-jin...\n\"\nThe Principal had just received a report from\nSuh Kang-jin\n.\n\"He's broken... that boy... he’s finally broken.\"\nThe Principal closed his eyes and sank into thought for a moment.\n\"\nAhyeya.\n\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\nSon Ye-seo\n, the Spartoi standing behind the Principal, answered.\n\"An Woo-jin will eventually come to kill me. He will crush everything that stands in his way and finally reach me.\"\n\"Come on, all of Neo Seoul's top forces are on standby, including Kang-jin. Even those useless old men from the Federal Council have holed up somewhere safe, protecting their own skins. There are no obstacles left. No matter how formidable An Woo-jin may be, it’ll be hard for him to take on everything we’ve got. The damage will be significant, but still...\"\n\"No... he will come. I know his type.\"\nThe Principal opened his eyes again, his brow furrowed. His arm, resting on the wheelchair's armrest, trembled slightly.\n\"We may have poked a monster even more dangerous than Goliath...\"\n\"Hmm... but won’t it be okay?\"\nYe-seo said with a smile.\n\"You have your daughter, ‘1215.’\"\n\"But she...\"\n\"She'll come.\"\nYe-seo spoke with conviction.\n\"When the worst moment arrives, that person will definitely come. To protect you.\"\nThe Principal pressed his dry lips together tightly.\n\"So, don’t worry, Principal. Somehow, things will work out. Think of what’s happening today as just the labor pains for the future.\"\n\"...I hope the pain isn't too great.\"\nThings were not looking good.\nThe Disciplinary Committee had been subjected to a search and seizure, had their leader taken away, and all organizational activities had been completely suspended.\nAttempting to act under martial law would only make them a target for the most powerful forces of Neo Seoul, treated as an unauthorized armed group.\nThe Disciplinary Committee was like a fish caught in a strong current.\n\"What do we do, what do we do...\"\nThe Disciplinary Committee’s office was a mess after being raided by the Student Council.\nHa Ye-song\nwas pacing the same spot repeatedly, her head bowed as she bit her thumbnail. Her expression was unusually serious.\n\"Everything's screwed up...! There's got to be a way, a way...!\"\n\"You're making my head spin. Could you calm down...?\"\n\"Aaah!\nMin-hyuk\n! What are we going to do!? The media and public opinion are united in slamming the Captain! The internet is in an uproar! If it weren’t for martial law, there’d be massive protests by now! The Student Council President is telling us to stay put! And the Martial Law Guards are out to take down the Captain...!\"\n\"This is why I didn’t want to get involved...\"\nPark Min-hyuk\nlet out a deep sigh.\nEveryone was frustrated.\nYoo Do-ha\nwas seriously contemplating, while\nOh Baek-seo\njust stared at the floor, barely moving.\n\"By the way.\"\nWhen Do-ha spoke, Ye-song and Min-hyuk turned their attention to her.\n\"The Han Yang guys, their surveillance is weak.\"\n\"But they’re stationed outside, Do-ha...\"\n\"What I mean is, there might still be an opportunity.\"\n\"Hmm...\"\nYe-song fell into thought before speaking again.\n\"What if we become rebels?\"\n\"Are you crazy? We’re in this mess because we don’t have enough power to win. That’s why we’re even considering this.\"\nMin-hyuk responded immediately.\n\"No, no.\nMa-hyeon High\nis on our side too. What if we form some sort of rebel alliance...?\"\n\"There’s no chance. I’ve already dismissed that idea as futile.\"\nDo-ha replied.\n\"I know! That’s not what I meant...\"\nYe-song fought back her irritation and collected herself.\n\"If the fight comes down to a battle of power, then maybe we should focus on building up our own forces!\"\n\"Then who could we recruit?\"\n\"That... I need to think about.\"\n\"Wouldn’t it be more important to find the Captain first? It’s obvious he’s trying to keep us out of danger by going off alone. He probably expected to get caught by the Martial Law Guards if he came back to us.\"\nBzzzt.\n\"Hmm?\"\nAt that moment, Baek-seo’s smartphone vibrated. She took it out and checked the message.\nDal:You′reinatoughspotrightnow,aren′tyou?Dal: You're in a tough spot right now, aren't you?Dal:You′reinatoughspotrightnow,aren′tyou?\n‘Dal’ was\nKim Dal-bi\n. That’s how Baek-seo had saved her in her contacts.\nWhat could she want?\nAs Baek-seo pondered over the message, another one quickly followed.\nDal:I’vegotsomethingpreparedthatmighthelp.Dal: I’ve got something prepared that might help.Dal:I’vegotsomethingpreparedthatmighthelp.\nBaek-seo narrowed her eyes.\nDal:Canyoucomebyforabit?Dal: Can you come by for a bit?Dal:Canyoucomebyforabit?\nEven though Dal-bi had lost many of her memories, she would have held onto her resentment towards the Principal.\nAnd given the current situation, Dal-bi had no reason to side with the Principal.\nIn other words, Dal-bi might have prepared something to use against him.\nBesides, there was no benefit for Dal-bi in leading Baek-seo into a trap.\nThus, Baek-seo decided it was better to meet her.\n\"Hey, guys.\"\nBaek-seo stood up.\n\"What’s up, Baek-seo?\"\n\"I’m stepping out for a bit.\"\n\"Bathroom? Go ahead.\"\nBaek-seo left the office.\nYe-song and Min-hyuk didn’t suspect a thing, but Do-ha watched the door Baek-seo had exited through with a meaningful glance.\n\"You’re here?\"\nBaek-seo arrived at the place Dal-bi had asked her to meet. It was an office inside an abandoned building.\n\"You avoided surveillance well.\"\n\"That’s easy for me.\"\nFor someone who had once been an assassin in Spartoi, evading surveillance was hardly a challenge.\n\"And for some reason, the surveillance around here has weakened too.\"\nBecause Woo-jin had shared his magical information with Spartoi, a lot of forces were on the move. As a result, the number of Martial Law Guards and robots patrolling the Ahseong High School district had significantly decreased.\n\"So, what are you doing?\"\nDal-bi was sitting in front of an old but large monitor. The computer was running.\nBaek-seo moved closer to see the screen.\nMultiple windows were open. Despite its appearance, the computer boasted impressive performance, judging by its processing speed.\n\"I’m getting ready to drop a bomb.\"\n\"A bomb?\"\n\"I’ve been preparing something. I think I need to help Woo-jin.\"\nDal-bi had been preparing to bring down the Principal.\nThough she had lost many memories, her preparation to take down the Principal remained intact.\n\"I found a place on the Deep Web. A place even the Principal’s reach can’t touch. I’ve gathered a lot of data from there.\"\n\"Is it okay to talk about this so openly?\"\n\"The place is well soundproofed. There’s nothing to worry about around here. I’ve hidden this place thoroughly.\"\n\"Really...? But isn’t the Deep Web like... the dark side of the internet? Full of illegal activities and impossible to control.\"\n\"There are a lot of shady areas, but there are also some useful places.\"\nBaek-seo’s eyes scanned the information protected by the Deep Web’s security features.\n\"What’s this...?\"\n\"All the illegal activities the Principal has been involved in, and the evidence of it. I’ve been collecting everything I could as an Enforcer. I’m going to expose it all.\"\n\"Hold on.\"\nBaek-seo gently pushed Dal-bi’s hand aside and moved the mouse. As she scrolled through the documents, she found evidence related to the false accusations against Woo-jin.\nThe Principal had tried to pin some of his own crimes on Woo-jin.\n\"Because of the martial law, everyone’s glued to the internet and TV. This is our chance.\"\nDal-bi said.\n\"This is... really impressive.\"\nIf Baek-seo had been planning to assassinate the Principal by exploiting his weaknesses...\nDal-bi had been gathering evidence to corner him.\nBaek-seo could only imagine the effort Dal-bi must have put in.\n\"Really...?\"\nDal-bi blushed, scratching her nose sheepishly.\nBut Baek-seo wasn’t entirely at ease.\n\"This is good stuff, but... if we feed this information to the media bit by bit, it could be dangerous. There’s a high chance the Principal would find out before it goes public. He’ll definitely take action.\"\n\"I’ve already prepared for that.\"\n\"How?\"\n\"We’ll drop it all in one big hit. But it’s tough to do it alone... I have something prepared, but I need your help to make it more secure and impactful.\"\nDal-bi looked at Baek-seo with determination.\n\"If we’re really in this fight together, help me. I need you.\"\nBaek-seo smiled warmly and answered without hesitation.\n\"Tell me what you need.\"",

      "content": "Two escort vehicles from Han-Yang Federal Academy\nwere speeding down the road.\nInside these vehicles were the two Six Criminals they had taken from Ahseong High School’s Disciplinary Committee:\nHan Seo-jin\nand\nMoon Chae-yeon\n, each in a separate vehicle.\nHan Seo-jin was still crystallized and bound. There were no signs of change yet.\nBut change often comes suddenly.\nCrack.\n“Huh?”\nAt the sudden, unnatural sound, one of the Spartoi looked up.\nSomehow, a large crack had formed in the crystal that encased Han Seo-jin’s body.\nAnd then, in an instant...\nShatter!\n“!”\nThe crystals that had covered Han Seo-jin shattered and scattered in all directions. Since the restraints were over the crystallized skin, they had become loose.\nSeo-jin immediately utilized his magic to strengthen his body and escaped his confines.\n“Emergency—!”\nThe Spartoi was about to report when—\nSmash!\nThe surveillance wall was destroyed, and Seo-jin’s hand was already gripping the Spartoi’s head. In the next moment, dark purple magic surged into Seo-jin’s hand.\nA sinister aura seeped into the Spartoi’s entire body, and his eyes turned bloodshot.\n‘This magic… it’s different from before…!’\nThe Spartoi was an aide to the Principal.\nSo, he knew about Seo-jin, one of the Six Criminals.\nBut for some reason, Seo-jin’s magical density was on a completely different level than before.\nSo much so that the Spartoi couldn’t even hope to match it.\nThud.\nThe Spartoi finally collapsed like a puppet with its strings cut and breathed his last.\n“What was that noise?! Huff...!”\nHearing the loud noise, the other Spartoi rushed into the surveillance compartment, startled, but they quickly assessed the situation and prepared for battle.\nSeo-jin’s cold, emotionless eyes locked onto them.\nIt took less than 30 seconds for them to become corpses.\n“Ugh, I’m stiff…”\nSeo-jin stretched, placing one hand on his shoulder and tilting his neck from side to side.\nHe was still wearing the same hooded robe he had on when he crystallized right after losing to An Woo-jin.\nSeo-jin reached into his robe and pulled out a half-shattered skull mask, which he placed on his face. At that moment, the Necromancer, one of the Six Criminals, had returned.\nIn the transport compartment, everyone except the driver had been killed.\nAll at the hands of just one person, Han Seo-jin.\nThe operation was so silent that the driver was completely unaware of what had transpired.\nSeo-jin started walking. Soon, dark purple magic emanated from the floor, and his body sank beneath it.\nOnly the corpses remained in the transport compartment.\nInside the other escort vehicle that was traveling alongside.\nMoon Chae-yeon\nwas spending her time with her eyes closed, clad in a special restraint suit.\nSince the vehicle was designed for the transportation and confinement of criminals, the transport compartment was well-equipped with restraining facilities.\nChae-yeon clicked her tongue, feeling more uncomfortable than she did back at Ahseong High School.\n“What the hell is going on... Huh?”\nSuddenly, Chae-yeon sensed something off and opened her eyes wide.\nFor some reason, the presence of the people in the surveillance compartment beyond the mirror had disappeared. Or more accurately... had they collapsed?\nSoon, she felt a chilling presence behind her. In the reflection on the surveillance wall, she could see a dark purple magic circle forming on the floor, and something was being summoned.\nChae-yeon turned her head back and caught sight of a familiar face.\n“Ohhh...!”\nChae-yeon exclaimed in awe.\nThe person who appeared behind her was the expressionless schoolgirl,\nHan Seo-jin\n.\n“When did you wake up!? Did you come to rescue me?”\nSeo-jin didn’t respond and instead summoned a spectral beast. The summoned creature swung its sharp claws and tore through Chae-yeon’s special restraint suit.\n“Whoa~.”\nChae-yeon whistled as she stood up.\n“Oops.”\nIt had been so long since she last stood that her legs wobbled, struggling to support her weight.\nOnce she regained her balance, Chae-yeon grinned and stared at Seo-jin.\n“Wow, this is amazing! Is this what freedom feels like? It’s been so long since I stood up that it’s hard to stay on my feet. Hehe...!”\n“Spartoi will soon realize this escort has been compromised and deploy reinforcements. The ones here were weak, but if proper support arrives, things will get tough.”\n“Spartoi? Even if they show up, I don’t think I’ll lose. Unless Suh Kang-jin comes, that is~. But you, you’ve gotten stronger, haven’t you?”\n“A lot has happened.”\nSeo-jin extended his magic-infused hand and placed it against the surveillance wall.\nBoom!\nThe surveillance wall shattered effortlessly.\nChae-yeon rolled her wrists, stretching her body. The smile on her face gradually faded.\n“You know...”\n“?”\nSeo-jin stopped in her tracks.\n“When I briefly died, it was you I met, wasn’t it?”\n“...Yes.”\nChae-yeon let out a small laugh.\n“Why? Is there something that happens when we die? Like, does the sky suddenly turn red...? I felt really scared back then.”\n“I’ll tell you while we’re on the move.”\nScreech.\n“......”\nIn an instant, Chae-yeon generated mechanical blades from her arms and held them to Seo-jin’s neck.\nSeo-jin calmly turned to face Chae-yeon.\nA bright smile hung on Chae-yeon’s lips.\n“I don’t remember agreeing to follow you. And I don’t get why someone with no sense of camaraderie would go out of their way to save me~? You’re really suspicious, you know that?”\n“I learned the truth. That’s why I want you to help me.”\n“The truth? Out of nowhere, the truth? What, did you have a chat with the Grim Reaper or something? Heaven or Hell? Did you see some sort of afterlife? What truth?”\nSeo-jin fully turned toward Chae-yeon. Seeing the seriousness in her face, Chae-yeon lowered her mechanical blades. She hadn’t intended to attack Seo-jin in the first place.\nChae-yeon raised both hands and shrugged.\n“Well, whatever. I’ve already made up my mind about what I’m going to do.”\n“About what...?”\n“Everything’s annoying. Everything just pisses me off.”\nChae-yeon smiled brightly, extended her arm, and pointed her thumb downward.\n“So I’m going to destroy this city, along with the Principal, and make a real mess of things.”\n“...Like the Disciplinary Committee President?”\n“Eh?” Chae-yeon was taken aback.\n“The Disciplinary Committee President? You mean An Woo-jin?”\n“Yes.”\n“No way, why would that guy...?”\nThe idea that the Disciplinary Committee President, someone who upheld the law and order, wanted to destroy the Academy City.\nUnderstanding how dire the situation must be for him to consider such a thing, Chae-yeon couldn’t help but be shocked.\n“Aha, aha! Hehe...! So that’s it. Our Disciplinary Committee President~, he’s finally decided to go all the way to hell, huh?”\nChae-yeon clasped her hands together and reacted playfully. The thought of the situation alone was enough to amuse her.\nSuddenly, thoughts of Woo-jin’s girls,\nKim Dal-bi\nand\nOh Baek-seo\n, flashed through Chae-yeon’s mind. They had endured all kinds of suffering while resisting the Principal.\n“Well, I guess that makes sense. He’s been through so much because of the Principal. I bet it’s absolute chaos now.”\n“Probably.”\nChae-yeon walked past Seo-jin.\n“...So, what will you do?”\n“What do you think? I’m going to do whatever I want!”\n“Whatever you want?”\nChae-yeon stopped and looked back at Seo-jin.\nWith an expression that said it was only natural.\n“If the Disciplinary Committee President is trying to destroy this city along with the Principal, then our interests perfectly align, don’t they?”\nA smirk crept across Chae-yeon’s face.\n“I don’t like the Disciplinary Committee President, but I like this. I’m sure of it! I can finally get rid of this suffocating feeling that’s been weighing on my chest!”\n“......”\n“And you?”\n“I think my path is the same as yours.”\n“Because of that truth or whatever?”\n“Yes.”\n“You mentioned before that you needed to help An Woo-jin. Is that related to what you discovered?”\n“Yes.”\n“Tell me on the way. I’m curious.”\n“Yes.”\n“Is ‘yes’ the only thing you can say?”\n“Yes...?”\nChae-yeon and Seo-jin opened the transport compartment door and stepped out of the vehicle.\nUnder the darkened sky.\nThey landed on the road.\nAt that moment, a swarm of security drones patrolling Neo Seoul spotted them.\nAnd the androids of the Martial Law Guards on patrol raised an alarm.\n“The city’s looking really bleak. Even near the Central Area. And those tin cans... they’re not your average ones, are they? Ah, the martial law has been declared, hasn’t it?”\nChae-yeon clicked her tongue and formed a mechanical spear, gripping it firmly.\n[Switching to combat mode.]\nThe androids, sensing magic, all shifted into combat mode.\n“There are a lot of them. Conserve your magic and focus on escaping.”\n“Han Seo-jin, you know, it’s been a really long time since I last moved? Can you imagine how much my body has been itching? Could you at least consider that?”\n“Hah... Fine, do as you please...”\nThen, it happened.\nKoooooooom!\nA deafening sound brushed past their ears like a hallucination.\nBefore they realized it, something heavy had covered the world, making them feel as if their bodies were being crushed flat.\nFor a moment, they thought they were dead.\nBut when they looked down in shock, they found their bodies were unharmed.\nAll the lights illuminating the city went out simultaneously, plunging everything into darkness. Silence fell over the world, and then the city’s lights returned.\nChae-yeon and Seo-jin instinctively turned their heads in the same direction, cold sweat trickling down their backs.\nCraaaack!!!\nSomething that shouldn’t be torn was tearing apart.\nThe sky itself split open, creating a massive and mystical rift. The overwhelming pressure felt as though a god was declaring the city’s destruction.\nThis was the heart of Neo Seoul.\nThe Central Tower stood at the center, the hub of administration.\nAbove it, a magical formula, crafted by someone’s magic, had formed.\nBoom!\nWith each step the figure took, the surrounding buildings collapsed, and the ground caved in. The noise was not that of explosions but rather of everything succumbing to an incomprehensible force.\nAt the center of it all, a man walked forward, his eyes glowing teal.\nWith each step, the world around him knelt in submission.\nThe approaching androids and drones were sucked into the rift like a black hole, disintegrating as they went.\nEven long-range attacks were futile. New rifts appeared, diverting the attacks to another dimension.\nBoom!\nThe debris from the collapsing buildings flew toward Chae-yeon and Seo-jin. Chae-yeon generated a mechanical shield to block the debris, but the robots targeting them were all swept away and destroyed.\nBeyond the fallen buildings and across the torn ground.\nThey saw the cataclysmic figure walking through the open path, a force of nature in human form.\nThey stared at the man in disbelief.\n“We can’t get close...!”\n“Who the hell is that guy...!?”\nEven the nearby Martial Law Guards hesitated to approach.\nThey instinctively knew that getting closer would mean certain death.\nKrrrraaaack!!\nA gale whipped around the man who had become the target of Neo Seoul, and teal-colored thunder roared fiercely.\nAn astronomical flow of magic, now endowed with physical force, was sweeping through the area.\nAmidst wielding all this destruction, the man’s face remained cold and resolute.\nAn Woo-jin.\nThe one who controlled space was now determined to destroy everything.\nChae-yeon swallowed dryly, forcing a laugh as she tried to maintain her composure.\n“Who’s helping who here...?”\nShe had known the Disciplinary Committee President was strong, but to the point of being able to overthrow Neo Seoul?\nWhat had once seemed like a humorous thought now filled Chae-yeon with a sudden and intense fear as she felt Woo-jin’s overwhelming magic firsthand.\nThat can’t be stopped.\nThat is something of an entirely different level.\nChae-yeon was certain that today, the Principal would lose everything.",

      "content": "The center of Neo Seoul.\nAn emergency evacuation order was issued for the Central Area.\nIt was as if an earthquake that could destroy everything had struck.\nAs if a tsunami that could sweep away everything was approaching.\nAs if a hurricane that could blow everything away was bearing down.\nThe citizens began evacuating urgently under the guidance of the Martial Law Guards.\nFortunately, the number of citizens needing evacuation was relatively small compared to other districts.\nThe Central Area was the core administrative zone of the city, far from residential areas, and the martial law had already caused many citizens to leave earlier.\nHowever, the suddenness of the evacuation order threw the scene into chaos.\nKoooom!!\nAn immense magical power enveloped Neo Seoul.\nThe sky split open, and from afar, a storm filled with teal-colored lightning began to approach. The citizens screamed and hurried their evacuation.\nA natural disaster was coming.\nOne with intent.\nThe most dangerous being in this city.\nA boy who once upheld law and justice to protect his home and ensure a happy future had become an avatar of destruction.\nKoooom!!\nClick!\nClick!\nThe Central Area’s emergency defense system.\nThe firepower concentration sequence was activated.\nThe Central Area entered a full defensive mode to protect the Central Tower and the Principal.\nBuildings around the Central Tower transformed, revealing massive weaponry, including large cannons, emerging from the ground and structures. It was a grand combat mode.\nThe entire district had turned into a weapon.\n“……”\nTo\nAn Woo-jin\n, everything protecting the Principal was an obstacle.\nThe only reason he was approaching so menacingly was to destroy the administrative heart of the city and its forces, buying time for the citizens to flee.\n“What… is that…?”\nAll the Martial Law Guards stationed in the city were gathering in the Central Area. They stared at Woo-jin, unable to close their mouths.\nThey weren’t sure if they could handle the magical power radiating from Woo-jin alone.\n“‘White’ said he’d intervene. Our top power. So don’t be afraid…. If we can’t stop that, this city is finished…!”\nA fellow Spartoi said, steeling his resolve.\nThe code name \"White,\" meaning someone who could turn everything into a clean slate, was the alias used exclusively within Spartoi to refer to\nSuh Kang-jin\n, the strongest member of Spartoi and a 7th-tier mage.\nWith him stepping in, the Martial Law Guards clung to hope.\nMeanwhile, some of the Martial Law Guard forces were stationed inside the Central Tower.\n“That is a 7th-tier mage…?”\nPrincipal Lee Doo-hee\nwatched the figure approaching, carrying an overwhelming magical power that tore the sky apart.\nWith every step, the ground was crushed, buildings collapsed, debris flew, storms erupted, and thunder roared.\nAny ordinary person would be terrified to stand before that.\nEven the Principal wasn’t an exception.\nThe trembling in his hands wasn’t due to old age. It was the long-forgotten fear of death.\n“That power… it’s unfathomable… This is absurd…”\nThe Principal let out a bitter laugh.\nWoo-jin’s magic had an extremely high purity. With every step up the ranks, his growth surpassed that of anyone else.\nCurrently, Woo-jin wasn’t just a novice at the 7th tier.\nHe was already a supreme being who had fully mastered the 7th tier.\n“My eyes didn’t deceive me. But I failed to realize that this brat was a greater threat than Goliath… That was my fatal mistake…!”\n“Principal.”\nSon Ye-seo\n, the Spartoi behind him, reacted, as if trying to calm him. But the Principal couldn’t hide his agitation.\n“Why do you think that brat is walking all the way here when he can freely teleport through space? Why…!”\n“Is it because he’s underestimating you?”\n“No. No…! He plans to thoroughly crush everything related to me. He must have figured out that this Central Area was designed to protect me…!”\nThe Principal clenched the end of his armrest with his trembling hand. She stared wide-eyed at her new adversary.\n“I must crush that brat, no matter the cost…!”\nThis was the final battleground.\nThe Principal was now convinced that his ultimate opponent, the one he should have put everything into defeating, wasn’t Goliath—it was An Woo-jin.\n“Is that so…? Hmm?”\nAt that moment, Ye-seo received a message on her smartphone.\n“…Hmm.”\nAfter ending the call, Ye-seo checked the internet and frowned for the first time.\n“Principal. I have something to report.”\n“What is it?”\n“The public sentiment… is shifting in a bad direction.”\nYe-seo manipulated her tablet PC and handed it to the Principal. As soon as he saw the screen, veins bulged on his forehead.\n“They finally… are making this interesting, these mere discarded pawns…!”\nThe Principal sneered, his body trembling with rage.\nA few dozen minutes earlier.\n“Huh?”\nHan Seo-jin\nand\nMoon Chae-yeon\nsensed a familiar magical presence from behind. They turned their heads and saw an unexpected figure.\nChae-yeon laughed as if she had just watched a comedy video.\n“Pfft…! You actually caught up, Deputy Director?”\nThe person who appeared was a schoolgirl wielding a black sword,\nHyeon-un\n. It was\nOh Baek-seo\n.\nSeo-jin stared blankly at Baek-seo. For some reason, she didn’t seem to have any intention of fighting.\nIt didn’t look like she had come for a confrontation.\n“You came to fetch me in this situation? Aww, how sweet.”\n“……”\nBaek-seo ignored Chae-yeon’s words and looked far off at Woo-jin, who was walking away.\nA human of the 7th tier, destroying everything around him just by walking and releasing his magic.\nAll the enemy forces were focused on Woo-jin, but none could approach him.\nThe androids and guard drones either self-destructed to attack Woo-jin or fired from a distance, but all were swept away by Woo-jin’s magic or disappeared into sudden rifts.\nBaek-seo watched Woo-jin with a face full of complex emotions.\nRight now… she couldn’t get close to him.\nThere was something she needed to do first.\n“Hey, it’s kind of rude to ignore someone standing right in front of you, don’t you think…?”\n“I didn’t come to take you back.”\nHer tone was cold.\nBaek-seo’s eyes turned to Chae-yeon.\n“Then?”\n“I’m here to make you an offer.”\n“An offer?”\nBaek-seo walked closer to Chae-yeon, then noticed Seo-jin and paused, surprised.\n“You woke up?”\n“Completely uninterested, huh…”\n“You’re fine for now. I can always catch you later.”\nBaek-seo was unfazed by Seo-jin’s revival. The situation at hand was far more pressing.\n“Pfft! That’s why I told you to work on your social skills! Then I would have greeted you warmly, wouldn’t I? Huh?”\nChae-yeon giggled.\nBaek-seo stopped in front of Chae-yeon. Chae-yeon smiled at her.\n“So, what’s the offer? Let’s hear it.”\n“If you promise to live quietly from now on, I’ll promise not to pursue you for your past crimes. This offer doesn’t concern other law enforcement agencies, though.”\nAt the unexpected proposal, entirely out of sync with the current situation, Chae-yeon raised an eyebrow.\n“Huh? Suddenly? Oh, I get it~.”\nThen, Chae-yeon understood Baek-seo’s intention and let out a small laugh.\n“You need my abilities, don’t you?”\n“Yes.”\n“And it’s for your boss, right? What’s the goal?”\n“The Principal.”\n“Deal.”\n“Deal?”\nBaek-seo was taken aback by how quickly Chae-yeon agreed without hearing the details.\n“You don’t seem like you’ll make unreasonable demands~, the terms are good, and most importantly, taking down the Principal? I’d pay to do that! How could I refuse something with only benefits?”\n“…So, you really don’t like the Principal?”\n“Of course not! I had to grovel and play the Principal’s lackey just to survive! Who’d enjoy doing that? Now I feel like I’ve got a real shot. Like I might actually live to see the Principal fall…!”\nChae-yeon chuckled.\nIf she could see the Principal’s downfall, she would do anything.\n“So? What do you need me to do?”\n“Hijack the broadcast.”\n“What? That’s easy? Is that all?”\n“We’re going to expose the Principal’s crimes.”\n“You… you’re saying things that make me so happy so casually…!”\nChae-yeon closed her eyes tightly and let out a sound like she had just enjoyed a refreshing drink. Then she looked at Seo-jin.\n“I’m off. We can finish our earlier conversation later, or you can pass it on to the person who needs to hear it.”\n“Yes.”\n“You’re agreeing pretty easily, aren’t you? Oh Baek-seo is supposed to be your enemy, you know?”\n“What do you expect me to do…. Our goals seem to align for now. We can fight later.”\n“Hmm, wait a minute. Shouldn’t I actually be more at odds with her?”\nBaek-seo nodded.\n“You were at the forefront of trying to kill me.”\n“Oh, come on~. Let’s put the past behind us! I’m not looking for redemption, but I didn’t want to do it either! I had to follow the Principal’s orders to survive, right? Right!?”\nChae-yeon waved her hands dismissively.\n“I know. It doesn’t really matter now.”\n“Hm, okay then.”\nChae-yeon stood next to Baek-seo.\n“Alright, lead the way.”\n“Yes.”\nFlash!\nBaek-seo and Chae-yeon left the area at high speed.\nAnd then...\nAn astonishing event occurred for the citizens watching the news on TV or through online videos.",

      "content": "Crackling!!\nThe teal lightning and blue frost carved their forms into the air, heading toward the center of the Central Area.\nThey were moving the battlefield. An Woo-jin and Suh Kang-jin both feared that their own people would be caught in the crossfire, and they understood each other's thoughts.\nCrack!!\n\"!\"\nAround Kang-jin, a multitude of irregular cracks suddenly appeared in the air, all aimed at him.\nImmediately, high-density teal lightning shot out from the cracks, targeting Kang-jin.\nRumble!!\nKang-jin exhaled cold air and narrowly dodged the lightning, but Woo-jin’s attack didn’t end with a single strike. The lightning traveled through one crack and emerged from another, growing stronger each time it reappeared, continuing to pursue Kang-jin.\nEven when he barely evaded it, the lightning, formed from a massive amount of magical energy, kept intensifying.\nIt raced through the cracks, darting in all directions with incredible speed.\nCracks vanished only to reappear in new locations, channeling the relentless bolts of lightning.\nThe lightning, which should have dissipated after a straight shot, kept going. Woo-jin, using only a minimal amount of magic, kept amplifying the power of the lightning as it relentlessly burned and shattered everything in its path like paper.\nThis was the power of spatial control, a unique ability.\nSecond Type Magic Formation: Spatial Lightning.\nGradually, the Spatial Lightning cornered Kang-jin.\nThose who were fighting in the Martial Law Guard and the Disciplinary Committee alliance glanced at the scene and couldn’t help but be stunned by the ferocity of the battle.\nAt that moment, Kang-jin reached out towards Woo-jin and snapped his fingers.\nSnap!\nWoo-jin heard a sharp sound, almost like an echo that seemed to pierce his eardrums.\nIn an instant, a vast, enclosed space appeared before Woo-jin’s eyes.\nA fierce, biting cold began to envelop him.\nThe space, filled with Kang-jin’s freezing magic, felt like an extreme freezer.\nEven a 5th-tier combatant would find their lungs freezing and lose their life just by inhaling the air here.\nA 6th-tier combatant would barely last a few seconds.\nThis was a prison of ice, designed to freeze Woo-jin to death.\nUnique Ability: Cube.\nThird Type Magic Formation: Blue Lotus Prison.\nThis was another space, formed by Kang-jin’s unique ability, Cube.\nWith the enhanced cold magic he had honed, Kang-jin had created this Third Type Magic Formation.\nAnyone trapped in this icy hell would turn blue, their flesh splitting and blossoming into the shape of a lotus.\nKang-jin had cranked the magic output to its maximum. He was certain that if he didn’t give his all, he wouldn’t be able to defeat Woo-jin.\nInside the Cube, living beings would lose their sense of direction, but Woo-jin casually exited the prison with a spatial leap.\nThe Blue Lotus Prison, a mystical cube-shaped formation, rotated slowly in the air. Though Woo-jin had only been inside for a brief moment, his body was chilled to the bone. He quickly circulated his internal magic, reinforcing his body and dispelling the cold.\n\"Incredible….\"\nSeeing Woo-jin recover so easily, Kang-jin was taken aback.\n\"Did he dispel that cold with just physical reinforcement…?\"\nKang-jin had anticipated that Woo-jin would use a spatial leap to escape, so he had planned to keep flooding the space with cold to gain the upper hand.\nHe had poured out his magic at maximum output, but Woo-jin had brushed off the cold as if it were nothing.\nFor Kang-jin, who had always maintained the upper hand in battle, this was an entirely new experience.\nWithout hesitation, Woo-jin extended his arm, spreading his magic outward.\nRumble!!\nA powerful earthquake shook the ground. The terrain around Woo-jin and Kang-jin began to collapse, and the ground itself was sucked downward.\nKang-jin looked down.\nEverything except the Central Tower, protected by the jammer, began to crumble, forming a massive chasm beneath them. Surrounding the chasm was a gigantic rift, similar to the one in the sky.\nThe destruction was contained so that it wouldn’t harm the Disciplinary Committee alliance, but the area affected was still vast.\nRumble!!\nA fierce, earth-shaking roar filled the air as the rift in the ground swallowed up the land and debris, which then began to fall through the rift in the sky.\n“……!!”\nKang-jin’s head snapped up, his eyes widening in disbelief at the sight unfolding before him.\nThis was the mastery Woo-jin had achieved upon reaching the 7th tier.\nThe ability to overturn even heaven and earth.\nUnique Ability: Spatial Control.\nFourth Type Magic Formation: Heaven and Earth Reversal.\nIt was a truly overwhelming spectacle.\nThe Martial Law Guards, made up of several major academies and the Spartoi, along with the Disciplinary Committee alliance and the Goblin Army, were all stunned.\nEven Principal Lee Doo-hee and Spartoi member Son Ye-seo, who were watching from the Central Tower, gaped in awe.\nAs the city fell and the magic poured down with it, even Kang-jin felt a shiver of fear.\nHe, who had been worshipped as the strongest in this city and had grown bored with easily overpowering his opponents, now felt a new surge of excitement.\nHe resisted.\nWhoosh!!\nAn immense surge of cold magic erupted from the ground, surrounding the Central Tower.\nCubes of magic began to appear, rapidly coalescing.\nCrack!!\nBeautiful ice crystals sprouted around the cubes, quickly forming a massive and intricate ice palace.\nUnique Ability: Cube.\nFirst Type Magic Formation: Cube Generation.\nThe jammer’s barrier around the Central Tower could block the flow of magic but offered no protection against physical attacks.\nSo, to protect the Central Tower from the Heaven and Earth Reversal, Kang-jin constructed a solid ice palace outside the jammer’s barrier.\nWhoosh!!\nKang-jin dashed across the falling debris, unleashing cold energy to increase his speed, and swung his ice blade toward Woo-jin.\nSlash!!\nWhoosh!!\nWith a single slash, the icy magic shot out, slicing through the air.\nAnything it touched would freeze instantly, and the flesh beneath would be deeply cut.\nBut Woo-jin continued to dodge Kang-jin’s attacks by leaping through the debris with spatial leaps.\nWhenever Woo-jin distanced himself, Kang-jin would generate another Blue Lotus Prison, and Woo-jin would leap out, dispelling the cold.\nRumble!!\nNumerous cracks followed Kang-jin, unleashing a barrage of spatial lightning.\nWoo-jin relentlessly pursued Kang-jin through the cracks, eventually catching up to him and swinging the Iron Dragon Staff, now charged with teal lightning.\nKang-jin responded by slashing with his ice blade.\nClang!!\nThe Iron Dragon Staff and the ice blade clashed repeatedly, sending shockwaves of lightning and explosions of frost across the battlefield.\nTheir speed was impossible for anyone else to follow.\nAmid the debris raining down from the sky, the pale blue frost and teal lightning danced wildly.\nIn just a few seconds, they exchanged dozens of blows.\nTheir battle had reached a level far beyond what any citizen of Neo Seoul could comprehend.\nWoo-jin’s relentless assault, unhindered by the constraints of space, even began to push Kang-jin to his limits.\nFighting in the open sky was one thing, but with the falling debris and structures providing cover, Woo-jin’s tactics became incredibly difficult to counter.\nThe spatial lightning, too, became harder to detect when obscured by the debris, making it difficult to react in time.\nIf Kang-jin focused solely on detecting the magic, it became challenging to track Woo-jin’s relentless physical attacks.\n‘Deception….’\nNo matter how much he blasted away the debris with his cold magic, it was only temporary.\nThe debris continued to fall from the sky, replenishing itself endlessly.\nWoo-jin carefully calculated Kang-jin’s field of view, using the falling debris to conceal his movements.\nKang-jin quickly realized what was happening.\n‘He possesses great power, but instead of relying on brute force, he fights tactically.’\nIt was overwhelming.\nTo see a human, who was essentially a walking natural disaster, use that power strategically was terrifying, even to Kang-jin.\nYet, instead of fear, Kang-jin felt exhilaration.\nThis was the first time he had faced such a powerful opponent.\nFinally…\n“!”\nAs if it were inevitable, Kang-jin lost sight of Woo-jin completely.\nThe Iron Dragon Staff, tracing a teal arc, pierced through Kang-jin’s defenses.\nBoom!!\nThe shockwave from the lightning-infused strike roared violently.\nThe sheer physical force of the Iron Dragon Staff was devastating.\nIn that instant, Kang-jin glimpsed death.\nBoom!!\nKang-jin’s body was flung through the air, crashing through falling debris multiple times. He quickly generated a Cube, stopping his trajectory and preventing himself from being flung out of the battlefield.\nHis insides were in shambles.\nHis bones were shattered.\nKang-jin spat blood and grinned.\n‘Impressive, An Woo-jin….’\nCrack.\nThere was no time for admiration.\nA crack appeared right before him.\nFrom it, Woo-jin emerged, lightning crackling around him as he prepared to strike again with the Iron Dragon Staff.\nIn Kang-jin’s view, Woo-jin’s eyes were filled with a relentless determination to finish him off.\nFor as long as Kang-jin could remember, he had considered himself the strongest, aside from Goliath. No one had ever come close to pushing him to the brink.\nBut this man was different.\nThe overwhelming pressure.\nFor the first time, Kang-jin was experiencing the sensation of being overpowered.\nIn that fleeting moment, Kang-jin’s instincts screamed at him, a cold shiver running through his core.\nHow could he counter the immense power that Woo-jin wielded, the ability to control space itself?\nHe had always believed that his signature technique,\nBlue Lotus Prison\n, was powerful enough to defeat anyone in Neo Seoul. But in the face of Woo-jin, it seemed like nothing more than a child’s play.\nKang-jin understood this. That’s why he had been saving his trump card.\nWithout it, there was no way he could win against Woo-jin.\nKang-jin clenched his fist and summoned all his remaining magic.\nWhoosh!!\nA massive burst of cold energy erupted from him.\nBut as Woo-jin swung the Iron Dragon Staff again, his strike met nothing but air.\n“…….”\nWoo-jin felt his feet land on something solid, and he found himself standing once more.\nWhen he blinked, a scene similar to the\nBlue Lotus Prison\nfilled his vision.\nBut this was different from the\nBlue Lotus Prison\n.\nWhat spread out before him was a mystical space made entirely of beautiful ice sculptures.\nSnowstorms raged, and the ice structures glowed with a faint blue magic, creating an otherworldly atmosphere.\nIt was a landscape that didn’t belong in Neo Seoul.\nSome distance away, Kang-jin stood facing Woo-jin. They locked eyes once more.\nThe cold that filled this ice world was incomparably more intense than the chill of the\nBlue Lotus Prison\n.\n‘The coordinates…?’\nWoo-jin tried to set coordinates outside this space, thinking it was similar to the\nBlue Lotus Prison\n, but it didn’t work.\n“You can’t escape from here.”\nKang-jin’s voice was calm as he spoke.\n“The jammer’s power that surrounds the Central Tower, the power to block the flow of magic, is based on my magic.”\n“So this is similar?”\n“That’s right. My unique ability,\nCube\n, creates this space. The\nBlue Lotus Prison\nI created on the spot couldn’t stop your magic flow, but here, you won’t be able to escape.”\nKang-jin’s blue eyes gleamed with a chilling light.\nUnique Ability: Cube.\nFifth Type Magic Formation: Absolute World.\nWoo-jin sensed the magic in the area, trying to set coordinates and understand the principles of this world.\n‘The barrier…?’\nThe coordinates were blocked by something that felt like a wall.\nThis magical formation had a barrier that separated it from the real world, and any magic that touched that barrier would freeze.\nIn other words, Woo-jin couldn’t escape using his spatial abilities.\n“This cold… does it affect you as well?”\nThe cold that enveloped the\nAbsolute World\npenetrated not only Woo-jin but also Kang-jin’s entire body.\n“This cold isn’t made of magic. It’s just a byproduct. And it offers the same death to everyone.”\nIt was essentially a suicide technique.\n“If you die first, I’ll release the magic formation. That would mean I’ve won. If I die first, the magic formation will dissolve on its own. Then, you’ve won.”\nWhoosh.\nKang-jin gripped his ice blade and assumed a combat stance.\nWhat was about to unfold was not just a battle.\nThe cold would relentlessly seek their mutual destruction.\n“This is the end.”\n…But.\n“You… seem to have forgotten something.”\n“What?”\nWoo-jin sighed, a frosty breath escaping his lips as he slowly raised his arm.\n“What my ability is.”\nWoo-jin’s ability was\nspatial control\n.\nA chilling realization struck Kang-jin’s mind.\nNo matter how extraordinary Woo-jin’s growth was, no matter how far beyond normal he had become, he had only just reached the 7th tier.\nKang-jin had never imagined that his ultimate technique could be so easily countered.\nBut Kang-jin had overlooked something important.\nWoo-jin had already transcended common sense.\nFor someone who had already defied expectations, it was not surprising that he could do so again.\nWoo-jin extended his right arm forward, drawing out his spatial control magic.\nReaching the 7th tier didn’t just enhance the power of one’s unique abilities. It also refined their mobility, flexibility, and every other aspect, developing them like a finely tuned instrument.\nWoo-jin had already manipulated the shape of spatial rifts against Hong-bin, the younger of the Gluttonous Siblings, and had done the same against the Spartoi squad that invaded Iseah’s hideout.\nHe had reshaped the rifts to his will.\nFollowing that principle, Woo-jin now began to reshape the form of the rift in his mind.\nWhoosh!!\nA mysterious magic of blue and purple intertwined as it flowed from Woo-jin’s hand.\nWith precision and control, he manipulated the magic.\nCrack!!\nThen, a massive rift appeared, engulfing the\nAbsolute World\n.",

      "content": "Suh Kang-jin frantically scanned his surroundings, his face filled with disbelief.\nThe form of the Absolute World was nowhere to be seen anymore. Only the cracks formed by An Woo-jin's magic filled the space where the Absolute World once existed.\nIf the Cube's walls could block the flow of magic, then all Woo-jin had to do was form cracks inside those walls.\nAnd that tactic proved to be the key to conquering the Absolute World.\n‘The cold...!’\nOne of the fundamental principles of magic: a magic user cannot be harmed by their own magic.\nHowever, the Absolute World was different. Even the caster could be harmed by the cold it produced.\nThis meant that the cold wasn't the result of the caster's magic, but rather a natural law that governed the world itself.\nIn that case...\n‘Did he figure out what causes the cold and block it with his cracks? Could he have realized what it is?’\nThe Absolute World had a source, an incredibly cold core of magic that caused the freezing temperature.\nAll Cubes were the same. They needed energy to sustain themselves.\nSo had Woo-jin figured out the source that made the Absolute World so cold? That source was hidden perfectly within the walls, shrouded by intense cold, making it nearly impossible to detect with magic.\n‘No... No!’\nKang-jin realized the truth.\n‘That bastard doesn’t know... He has no idea what the core that sustains the Absolute World is. That’s why he just decided to cover everything! The whole damn thing!’\nWoo-jin didn’t know the exact way to dismantle the Absolute World or even that there was such a core.\nInstead, he recklessly unleashed his overflowing magic and covered every inch of the walls, ceiling, and floor with cracks.\nHe had blocked out every possible variable.\nThat’s right.\nTo defeat Woo-jin with the Absolute World... he was simply too powerful.\n“Haha...”\nDespite realizing his defeat, Kang-jin couldn’t help but laugh bitterly.\n“What an absurd monster...!”\nHe was even moved by the experience.\nTo think that before his death, he could fight against such a monster.\nPaaaat!\nSuddenly, the space around them tore apart as new cracks formed, spreading everywhere like glitches in a broken game, disrupting the Absolute World.\nAnd then—\nWhiiiiish!\nThe cold grew even stronger, battering Kang-jin mercilessly.\nParts of his body froze rapidly, even though he wielded the power of ice, it became unbearable.\n‘Is he channeling all of the cold at me?’\nThe cracks formed in the walls of the Absolute World absorbed all the cold, then redirected it through the cracks in the air, unleashing it solely on Kang-jin, leaving Woo-jin in a blind spot.\nThe magic of spatial manipulation was meaningless in front of Woo-jin.\nWhooooosh!\nThe concentrated cold descended like a waterfall, so intense that even Woo-jin couldn't withstand its full force.\nBut Kang-jin wasn’t one to stand idle. He lunged toward Woo-jin.\nAs a living being, Kang-jin could pass through the cracks.\nBut when he tried to strike Woo-jin, it was nothing more than a futile attempt.\nThud!\nHis frozen legs wouldn’t carry him any further.\nWhenever Kang-jin shifted position, the cracks around him dynamically rearranged themselves, once again directing the freezing cold toward him.\nIt was a cruel sight.\nAs the cold penetrated his entire body, Kang-jin let out a hollow laugh.\nFacing death at the hands of an unbeatable force, he was nothing more than a plaything.\nWoo-jin gazed down at Kang-jin. His eyes were as cold and emotionless as the freezing air.\nKang-jin knew he had lost.\nTo die in a battle against someone so powerful—he didn't know how to express his gratitude to this man for giving him one final thrill before death.\nWith trembling lips, Kang-jin forced out the last words he could manage.\n“My life... was so meaningless... truly, a boring life...”\n“...”\n“An Woo-jin... thank you. Thanks to you, at least the end... was a bit fun...”\nKang-jin could say no more.\nHis body froze completely, and he breathed his last.\nChhhhring!\nThe Absolute World vanished in a blinding white light.\nWoo-jin retracted the cracks that had covered the walls, ceiling, and floor. Then, he began to fall once again from the center of the tower.\nThe Cube that had formed the Absolute World was gone.\n“What’s that...?”\nThe military forces and the Student Council’s allied troops who had been in the midst of battle turned their heads as the massive Cube that had composed the Absolute World disappeared in a flash of light.\nAt the same time, the majestic ice palace that had encased the Central Tower, towering into the sky, began to crumble into shining dust, carried away by the wind.\nThe falling dust surrounded someone and then disappeared as if in mourning.\nIt was a figure, frozen solid, plummeting through the air.\nEveryone saw it.\n“White...!?”\n“Did he... lose...?”\nEveryone was stunned.\nSuh Kang-jin, the strongest among Spartoi and one of the top powers in Neo Seoul, had fallen.\nAn Woo-jin, who had newly joined the ranks of the city’s strongest, had emerged victorious.\n“...!”\nA chilling surge of magic filled the area.\nWith the disappearance of the massive Cube and the Absolute World, the cracks that had driven Kang-jin to his death now revealed themselves.\nThe man standing before the cracks slowly extended his arms outward, gazing down at the Central Tower.\nThe image burned into everyone’s minds as if a god had descended, exuding an overwhelming aura.\nIt was an unspoken threat: that at any moment, he could bring down the Central Tower.\nWoo-jin's magical presence was so vast that it loomed over all of Neo Seoul. The citizens who witnessed the phenomenon were left speechless.\nLive broadcasts, now zooming in on Woo-jin with high-definition cameras, flooded the chat windows with exclamations.\nSuh Kang-jin, once a legend, had been defeated.\nThe sight of Woo-jin standing victorious left viewers with indescribable emotions.\n“Suh Kang-jin...”\nInside the Central Tower, Principal I Doo-hee’s voice trembled.\nWoo-jin stood there, unscathed, his abundant magic seemingly overflowing, a stark contrast to Kang-jin’s fate.\nThe Principal had no words left.\nThere was no longer any way to stop that man.\nBoom! Boom! Boom!\nThe defense systems of the Central Area unleashed a barrage of magical missiles and artillery toward Woo-jin like a storm.\nBut the space split wide open, and a massive crack absorbed every attack into a void.\nImmediately afterward, cracks appeared around the machines that had fired the magical rounds.\nBoom!\nAll the magic rounds were sent back, destroying everything around them in a massive explosion.\nSpatial Dominance. Third form of his magic: Spatial Reversal.\nEven an intense bombardment capable of obliterating an entire district was effortlessly neutralized by Woo-jin.\nThe sight brought a new wave of terror to the citizens.\nFrantically, the Principal pressed a button on his wheelchair.\nClunk! Clunk!\nThe Central Tower became encased in a high-density shell, reinforced by magic.\nDebris falling from the sky couldn’t penetrate the tower, but even this protective shell was just a temporary measure against Woo-jin’s spatial magic.\nIt was a futile attempt.\nCrack.\nWoo-jin vanished from the spot with a spatial leap.\nHe landed on the ground and passed beyond the barrier surrounding the Central Tower.\nImmediately, Spartoi agents, who had been lying in wait, ambushed Woo-jin, but they were all struck down by his spatial lightning.\nAfter dispatching the last of his enemies, Woo-jin used another spatial leap to enter the Central Tower.\n“Principal...!”\nAs Woo-jin entered the tower, the Student Council President bit his lip.\nEven though the Central Tower had means to protect the Principal, it would be meaningless in front of Woo-jin.\nAnd so, inside the Central Tower—\n“Gah!” “Ugh!”\nWoo-jin deliberately started from the lower floors, swiftly taking out the Spartoi guards protecting the Central Tower. It was a preemptive measure to eliminate anyone who might interfere.\nDespite the guards being composed of Spartoi’s strongest, they were no match.\nIf even Suh Kang-jin, one of the few capable of standing up to Goliath, had been defeated, who could possibly stop Woo-jin now?\nFinally, Woo-jin reached the Principal’s office.\nCrack.\nWithout bothering to open the firmly closed door, he casually leaped through space and entered the office.\n“You’ve arrived.”\nThe first voice he heard was Son Ye-seo’s.\nThe protective shell around the Central Tower allowed those inside to see outside, and Principal I Doo-hee had been staring out the window the entire time.\nShe turned her wheelchair around, meeting Woo-jin’s eyes with a meaningful expression. Son Ye-seo was there too.\n“So, you’ve made it here at last...”\nHis black uniform was tattered and torn from his previous battle with the Glutton. His face was smeared with dirt, his eyes gleaming coldly.\nOn his left arm, the armband of the Disciplinary Committee glimmered.\nAn Woo-jin.\nHe looked at the Principal with a cold, indifferent gaze and greeted him.\n“Pleased to meet you, Principal.”\nThen, in a calm, steady voice, he spoke.\n“I’ve come to finish this.”",

      "content": "\"Have we met before?\"\nThe girl in a nun's habit, Spartoi's Son Ye-seo, stepped forward in front of the Principal, her hands clasped as if in prayer.\nWoo-jin glared at Ye-seo.\n\"Isn't this a bit too violent? The Lord would be sad if He saw this.\"\n\"The Lord would vomit if He saw the piece of trash you're serving.\"\n\"Oh my, such vulgar language. You shouldn't say bad words.\"\nYe-seo pouted, her cheeks puffing out.\nThen, suddenly, her eyes widened.\nBefore she even realized it, Woo-jin was already right in front of her.\nThe speed that Woo-jin, a 7th-tier mage, could achieve through body enhancement was far beyond anything Ye-seo, a 6th-tier, could hope to match.\nCrackle!\nThe iron staff, wrapped in crackling lightning, swung down.\nBoom!\nWith a blast of electric shock, Ye-seo's body was shattered and sent flying.\nCrash! Her body smashed into the wall, breaking her form as she coughed up a mouthful of blood.\n‘What just happened...? Ah.’\nYe-seo quickly regained her senses, clasping her hands together and summoning her silvery magic, matching the color of her eyes.\nBut she wasn’t given a chance to counter.\n\"…!\"\nToo late, she realized.\nAs if it had been planned all along, a crack had already formed right above her head.\nShe lifted her head.\nIn that instant—\nRumble!\n\"Gah…!\"\nThe floor beneath her crumbled, and Ye-seo’s body began to plummet.\nWith each floor she fell through, Woo-jin opened cracks, consuming the ground beneath her.\n\"What the—!?\"\nAs a result, Ye-seo fell from the towering height of the Central Tower.\n‘I have to use elemental magic to escape…! What!?’\nHer escape wasn't allowed.\nA missile, stolen from the Center Area’s final defense sequence, fired through the crack above her.\nThis was one of the most dangerous missiles, designed to protect Neo Seoul and the Principal’s seat of power.\nIt was a masterpiece of Neo Seoul’s military industry, powerful enough to deal a fatal blow to Ye-seo in a single hit.\nIt was too fast. She couldn’t avoid it.\nBoom!!!\nThe missile hit Ye-seo, causing a massive explosion of magic.\nWoo-jin formed cracks around the area, absorbing the shockwave of the explosion and sending it far away.\nRumble!!!!\nA distant roar echoed.\nYe-seo’s magic faded away.\nWhether she was unconscious or dead, it was one of the two.\nWoo-jin didn't know the extent of Ye-seo’s abilities.\nBut it didn’t matter.\nThe battle had already been decided.\n\"She went down so easily... Pathetic.\"\nThe Principal sighed deeply.\nYe-seo had been one of Neo Seoul’s strongest, and now she was gone.\nFor the Principal, the result was hopeless.\nWith the Central Tower’s forces wiped out, only Woo-jin and the Principal remained.\nWoo-jin walked toward the Principal.\n\"I always wondered who would be the one to take my life... Turns out, it’s you.\"\nThe Principal spoke in a calm voice, attempting to start a conversation.\nSlam! Crack!\n“Hmph!”\nWith a swift strike from Woo-jin’s iron staff, the Principal’s thigh was crushed, and her wheelchair shattered.\nThe Principal winced in agony, groaning and clutching her mangled thigh.\nWoo-jin crouched down, staring at her without a hint of emotion. His eyes simmered with cold anger.\n\"I'm not asking you to clear my name. I won’t give you the time for that.\"\n\"What do you want to say...?\"\n\"Tell me what your objective was.\"\n\"My objective...? Ugh...\"\nCrack, crack.\nWoo-jin pressed the end of his staff against the back of the Principal’s hand, crushing it further.\n\"Why did you have to turn Dal-bi and Baek-seo into what they are? Why did you drive so many students to their deaths? Why did you make them into weapons of war? Why did you use the Six Sinners to commit terrorism? Why did you target me? Why did you try to manipulate this city?\"\nWoo-jin twisted his staff, grinding it into the Principal’s hand. She let out a scream of pain, gasping for breath.\n\"What kind of grand objective did you have... to do all that?\"\n\"I have no reason to tell you...\"\nCrunch!\n\"Arrgh!\"\nWoo-jin crushed her fingers with his staff.\n\"My goal... was just to live well.\"\nCrunch!\n\"Aaagh...! Stop, please stop…!\"\n\"I just wanted to live peacefully with the people I cared about. That was all. But you… what the hell was your reason?\"\nCrunch!\n\"Ughh... I... I...\"\n\"No, forget it. Don’t say anything.\"\nWoo-jin grabbed the Principal by her collar and threw her toward the desk.\nThud!\n“Ugh!”\nThe Principal crashed into the corner of the desk, her spine breaking. She slumped down, sitting against it.\nShe barely had time to register the pain as Woo-jin approached her again.\nHis eyes were filled with lethal intent.\n\"I’ve decided to destroy everything related to you. Including this Center Area. Whatever your objective was, once it’s all gone, that’ll be the end of it. It doesn’t matter if some questions remain unanswered.\"\n\"Wait... cough!\"\nThe Principal spat out blood.\nWoo-jin raised his iron staff, ready to strike.\nAnd then—\n♪♬♩...\nSuddenly, classical music played.\nIt was the ringtone of a smartphone that had fallen to the floor along with the wreckage of the Principal’s wheelchair.\nWoo-jin glanced toward the phone, and the Principal, startled, began to crawl desperately toward it.\nBut it was pointless.\nWoo-jin raised his hand, and a small crack formed, pulling the phone directly into his grasp.\n[1215]\nFor some reason, the caller’s name was a four-digit number.\nEven though Woo-jin didn't know who it was, he clearly remembered that number.\nIt was the same number Moon Chae-yeon had mentioned: the one the Principal followed, ‘1215.’\nAt that moment, the Principal, lying on the floor, grabbed onto Woo-jin’s pant leg, pleading desperately.\n\"Don't answer! Please don’t answer…! I beg you...!\"\nThe Principal begged, but Woo-jin kicked her away. Still, she crawled toward him on the floor, refusing to give up.\n\"That person... That person…!\"\nWoo-jin was deeply curious about the identity of '1215.’\nThe way the Principal referred to them as ‘that person’ suggested it might be a student.\nIgnoring her, Woo-jin answered the call.\nThe Principal froze.\n\"No...!\"\nHer face filled with despair, and a heavy silence followed.\n“…Who is this?”\nWoo-jin asked, his voice wary.\nAnd the voice that responded—\n─ So, you’ve finally come to finish off the Principal, huh, senior?\nWoo-jin’s breath caught in his throat.\nHis eyes widened in shock.\nThere was no mistaking it. That voice was so familiar, so clear, that he couldn't convince himself otherwise.\nIt made no sense. His mind spun in confusion.\n\"You... Why...?\"\n─ Life’s funny like that, isn’t it? I really, really liked you, senior...\n\"Ise-ah!!\"\nWoo-jin shouted at the top of his lungs.\nThe fact that the voice of someone he had opened his heart to was coming from where it absolutely shouldn't be turned his face into a mask of rage.\n─ Whoa, calm down, senior. You’re hurting my ears. I’m more delicate than you might think, you know.\n\"What... What’s your connection to the Principal? Tell me now.\"\n─ Hmm... Before that, how am I saved in your phone? You didn’t recognize me at first, so I’m guessing it wasn’t by my name, right? Some kind of nickname?\n\"1215…! What does that mean? What’s your connection to it?\"\n─ Ah! That’s what it is?\nIse-ah giggled, as if she hadn’t expected it.\n─ Senior, do you remember our first conversation? Do you?\nTheir first conversation...\nWoo-jin recalled it. It was near the start of the semester, on the day of the volunteer food service.\nIt was the first time Ise-ah had spoken to him.\n─ ‘Did you check your fortune today?’ ─ ‘Fortune?’ ─ ‘I’m a Sagittarius.’\nIse-ah’s birthday was under the sign of Sagittarius.\nAnd a Sagittarius is born on December 15th.\nWoo-jin let out a bitter laugh.\n\"This is ridiculous…\"\n─ Looks like the Principal really cared about my birthday, huh? I guess he was planning to give me something special this year, too~.\n\"...The Black Market?\"\n─ Yep. This year’s ‘gift’ would’ve been that, I guess? It wasn’t really a ‘surprise’ since I knew everything, though.\nThis semester, Ise-ah had become the ruler of the Black Market, destined to meet her death.\nHow had she, as the leader of a single group like Dohwa, managed to seize control of the Black Market, a massive entity tainted with dirty money?\nWoo-jin didn’t know the specifics of her methods.\nBut now that he knew the Principal, the most powerful figure in Neo Seoul, had backed her, it all started to make sense.\n\"So, Anomia... it was just a puppet for you all along?\"\n─ Haha. But wasn’t it a fun game?\nAnomia was the organization Woo-jin had defeated.\nThey had competed with Dohwa over control of the Black Market.\nAnomia was the organization Woo-jin had defeated.\nThey competed with Dohwa for control of the Black Market.\nThe major investor who backed Anomia was part of the Academy City’s ruling elite.\nAlthough there was no concrete evidence, Woo-jin had been certain that the Principal was the one behind those investments.\n\"So, the Principal backed Anomia, inflating its size with massive funding, and made them your natural competition. And the next step was obvious. Once Anomia grew big enough, you would stab them in the back and make them submit to Dohwa… All of this, for you.\"\n─ Wow~, as expected of you, senior! You got it right. I wanted to see Anomia, who tried to take me down, crawling at my feet. How fun would that have been? But you went and destroyed everything, so it never happened.\n\"Ise-ah…\"\n─ Still, I don’t hate or resent you, senior.\nIse-ah’s playful voice took on a more serious tone.\n─ I really did like you, from the bottom of my heart.\n\"Then why did you help me all this time? Like when we captured the Technomancer?\"\n─ The Six Sinners are just disposable cards. You can make more if you take the time.\n\"What?\"\n─ I wanted you, senior. I was just weighing my options. I hoped you’d become mine. That’s why I decided to help you recover someone important to you and build a bond by going on adventures together.\nDisposable cards.\nAt that phrase, Woo-jin flinched.\n─ Even if it was only for a short time, if I could make you open your heart to me, make you mine… I was confident I could have you wrapped around my finger. If I could have you, senior, the Six Sinners wouldn’t matter at all.\n\"…\"\n─ I asked the Principal not to touch you, Woo-jin. That was the one thing I requested. But I guess they couldn’t agree to that, even though they probably thought it was for my own good.\nIse-ah laughed softly.\n─ Whenever something happened to you, my heart would drop, senior. For that, I apologize. I’m sorry, senior. I’ll clear your name, make sure nothing bad happens to you, and I’ll give you a life of luxury. So don’t worry about the future. But in return… could you spare the Principal’s life?\nHer voice, though still light-hearted, carried a note of sincerity.\n─ That person… is kind of my parent, in a way. In a genetic sense, at least. You see, I’m the only one who was born from their genetic material, stored at the factory.\nWoo-jin’s brow furrowed, and he turned to look at the Principal.\nThe Principal looked back at him with a sorrowful expression.\nAt that moment, everything began to click in Woo-jin’s mind, the questions he had harbored finally falling into place.\nHe no longer needed the Principal to explain their goals. He understood.\n\"Ise-ah…\"\nWoo-jin asked coldly.\n\"Was your plan all along to take over Neo Seoul?\"",

      "content": "Silence fell.\nEventually.\n─ Hahaha…. Hahaha…!\nFrom beyond the smartphone, as if hearing some funny joke.\n─ Hahahahaha!!! Hahahahaha!!!!\nThe cheerful laughter echoed in Woo-jin's ears and delved into his heart.\n─ Waa! That's exactly right, senior! How can it be so accurate! Haha!! Yes, that's the correct answer!\nSe-ah responded like a magician whose excitement had risen during a magic show.\nTo Woo-jin, that laughter sounded shocking and detestable.\nThe principal's objective was to hand over Academy City Neo Seoul to Se-ah.\nTo train powerful subordinates who would have blood on their hands.\nTo eliminate reactionaries through illegal activities and destroy all traces.\nTo abuse power.\nGradually transferring the obscure parts of Neo Seoul, including the Black Market, and the troops the principal had secretly secured, to Se-ah and her organization, Dohwa.\nUltimately, to grant Se-ah the actual power to fully dominate Neo Seoul itself.\nIt didn’t matter how Se-ah was saved under any sender name.\nThe principal, who was suffering from dementia, had merely saved the sender name as ‘1215’ so that he could always remember her birthday, intending to give Se-ah something every year.\nAnd the birthday gifts that Se-ah would receive every year were gradually materials to swallow up Neo Seoul.\nThe reason.\nWhat was the reason?\nWoo-jin found that reason in the original work’s knowledge.\nIn the original, all members of Se-ah and Dohwa’s organization died, and the organization itself was obliterated. After that, the principal committed suicide. It was an undeniable, clear suicide.\nPresumably, the culprit was Obaekseo, who should have gone missing this semester.\nObaekseo, who had been investigating the principal closely, finally noticed the principal and Se-ah's plans and realized that the core of that plan was Se-ah and the Dohwa organization.\nTherefore, he secretly assassinated everyone.\nThe principal, shocked by losing Se-ah, committed suicide.\nIn other words, the principal's driving force was probably.\n‘Love.’\nThat precious emotion.\n‘Was the principal loving Se-ah as his daughter?’\nThe principal lost his reason for living because of Obaekseo.\nJust as the Six Sinners found and cherished their reasons for living.\nSimilarly, the principal had decided his reason for living as his daughter.\nBecause he loved her.\nBecause he loved his daughter so much.\nTherefore, Se-ah used the principal’s maternal love.\nShe needed the principal.\nBy placing this city under her control, to create a so-called ‘better world.’\nKiiing.\nSuddenly, the principal’s office door opened, and a beautiful female student with long black hair entered.\nShe was dressed in the school uniform of Aseong High School, the same school as Woo-jin.\nHer slender eyes shone with ruby-like red pupils, and her mouth curled up into a fox-like smile.\n“So, I told you before. I want to create a better world.”\nShe, Se-ah, looked at Woo-jin and spoke.\nWoo-jin lowered the smartphone from his ear and looked at Se-ah with eyes mixed with shock and coldness.\nThe principal was startled.\n“My… daughter….” “Wow~. You've been through a rough time, mother?” “Don't come here…. You're not ready yet….”\nSe-ah turned to the principal and, with a mischievous smile, pressed her index finger to her lips.\n“Mother, could you please shut up?”\nThe principal swallowed a sigh and stopped speaking.\nSe-ah smiled brightly and looked at Woo-jin again.\nWoo-jin was certain.\nSe-ah intended to become a necessary evil herself, to dominate Neo Seoul and move towards a utopia where everyone is happy.\nShe was altruistic, hoping that even a little more people's unhappiness would disappear.\nTherefore, for the ideal world she desired, she turned her back on all the sacrifices the principal had made.\nSuddenly, Woo-jin involuntarily thought of Goliath.\nHe had said he would watch what was right, but did he know this truth?\nEnough.\nThere was no point in thinking about such things.\nThe important thing was his own choice.\nCould he truly tolerate Se-ah?\nSe-ah’s smile slightly faded.\n“Senior, I’m trying to make the world happier for at least one more person. Please help me.” “…….”\nWoo-jin narrowed his eyes and glared at Se-ah.\n“Why?” “Because I believe it’s the right thing to do. Do I need some tremendous motivation?”\nThis girl’s words were sincere.\nBut, for the sake of a happy future world, could he dismiss the current sacrifices as 'opportunity costs' that are unavoidable?\nWoo-jin remembered seeing Baekseo dying, Dalbi confessing she liked him and collapsing.\nLike them, many children were painfully sacrificed to train the strong.\nWhat meaning does a future utopia have for children who couldn’t be allowed happiness and were ruined?\nThe fundamentally wrong process was now irrecoverable.\nThus, the result reached could not be considered beautiful.\nWhat was broken was broken.\nIt needed to be replaced with something new.\n“Really…. The world’s affairs turn out to be so harsh….”\nWoo-jin lamented with a sigh mixed in his voice.\nSe-ah’s smile faded.\n“It might seem like an abrupt confession…, but I was happy to have you as my senior. Honestly, I liked you. I knew you genuinely wanted to help people. Even if you seem like a sly fox, I thought you were a good person anyway.” “I’d prefer you not to say that now. Before you regret it.” “But!!”\nWoo-jin yelled, cutting off Se-ah’s words.\n“What are you?” “…….” “What are you affirming, and what illusions are you harboring? Do you know what you’ve trampled on?”\nCrack!\nWhen Woo-jin tightly gripped his Cheolryong-gon, turquoise electricity surged above the iron bar.\n“I can’t... understand you guys at all.”\nWoo-jin made a firm resolution.\nTo finish off the principal and Se-ah right here.\n“Yes. Is that so, is that so….”\nSe-ah bowed her head and held a bitter smile.\n“Because I can’t understand, you’re rejecting me. Then there’s nothing I can do. It’s a pity….”\nSe-ah raised her head again and stared at Woo-jin with blood-red eyes.\n“Thank you for everything, senior.”\nSe-ah smiled widely, and mysterious red magic surged from her.\nThat magic unfolded in the form of many young children’s torsos gathered densely, waving their arms.\nWoo-jin’s eyes widened. That grotesque magic exuded a chill he had never felt before.\n‘Why does it feel like not just one person, but the magic of many people is felt at once…?’\nWhy does the life force of many children seem to emanate from Se-ah’s magic?\nSuddenly, the many children who couldn’t endure the principal’s atrocities during the golden time and were disposed of came to mind.\nChildren who ultimately couldn’t become the principal’s dogs.\nPitiful children who were born, tasted only hell, and were ruined.\nHe recalled the fact that they were piled up like mountains, intact, deep underground.\n“That magic…, it’s not yours.” “You’re perceptive.”\nA murderous intent filled Woo-jin’s eyes.\n“The disposed children piled up underground…. What the principal did with them?” “Well. I don’t know the details. I only know it was related to the principal’s unique abilities.” “How can you use such disgusting things so casually?” “I don’t feel at ease about it, senior. I was forcibly given it when I was young. Now, well, I’ve accepted it.” “That’s not your power.” “Well. I wonder what it is.”\nThe disposed children were also geniuses whose innate magic was classified as A+.\nWhat kind of power was created by gathering all of them?\nHow did they even create such power in the first place?\nHowever, recalling Se-ah’s amazing unique ability to resurrect children who died in the first semester, it was undoubtedly an extraordinary power.\nCreak.\nA very small crack opened in Woo-jin’s ear.\n─ Kid.\nIt was Geumyang’s voice.\nWoo-jin looked at Se-ah and listened to Geumyang’s voice.\n─ It might sound strange, but that power shouldn’t exist. “?” ─ That is a power that should not be actualized in this world. Even if my body were here, I’m sure it would have judged the same as I did.\nIf it was Geumyang’s body, then a 9-tier creature, Hwanggeumyang.\nIt meant a being that had reached the realm of gods.\nThere was a slight tremble in Geumyang’s voice.\n─ Run away. That power is not something that can be judged by the world's laws or discussed in terms of superiority. It’s in the realm of the extraordinary for humans…! “What, I don’t know what’s what, but that seems difficult. I can feel something.” ─ Feel it? What are you talking about?\nDespite Geumyang’s dissuasion, Woo-jin approached Se-ah.\nBecause he was convinced that he shouldn’t run away here.\n‘I might have been reincarnated into this world because of that power…. I have that feeling.’\nIt was a cry of instinct.\nA sensation as if engraved on his soul.\nIt was something he could only feel as a reincarnated person in this world.\nAs Woo-jin began to approach, Se-ah showed a regretful expression. Then, she controlled her emotions and gave Woo-jin a warm smile.\n“I truly liked you, senior.” “Me too. My liking you was genuine, without a doubt.” “Yes. It’s a pity.”\nThe two felt that there was no need to continue the conversation.\nWoo-jin raised his magic to be able to evade enemy attacks with spatial leaps at any time, and held his Cheolryong-gon tightly.\nHe fired.\nSwoosh!\nIn an instant, a chilling light flashed in Se-ah’s red eyes as she watched Woo-jin.\n“……!”\nSuddenly, Woo-jin’s vision was filled with red.\nOne after another, Woo-jin felt his mind drifting away from his body.\nThud.\nHe collapsed on the floor.\nBefore he could even question what had happened.\n“Farewell.”\nWith Se-ah’s whisper, Woo-jin's breath ceased.",

      "content": "Woo-jin couldn't understand what had just happened.\nSuddenly, his entire body was free.\nIn his line of sight, the massive crack in the sky slowly began to close.\nEverything seemed to move sluggishly, as though time itself had lost its momentum.\n‘Am I dead? What the hell just happened…?’\nAs he blinked, the sky turned a deep red. Woo-jin, bewildered by the strange sight, blinked again and looked around.\nThe sensation pressing against his body felt eerily similar to when Se-ah had unleashed her full power. That chilling force now spread across all of Neo Seoul.\nWoo-jin looked down.\nHe found himself floating in the middle of the red sky, staring at an unfamiliar landscape.\nNeo Seoul was now blanketed in a terrifying red hue.\nCountless figures, resembling humans, were twisted and distorted, bound and shackled in various places. Managing them were tall, lanky creatures with black masks.\nTheir unnaturally long arms, legs, and fingers waved like reeds in the wind as they moved, their entire form resembling wriggling pieces of taffy.\nThese grotesque beings wandered the streets of Neo Seoul as if they were citizens enjoying their everyday lives.\n“……!”\nSuddenly, Woo-jin sensed a massive presence of humans and snapped his head in that direction.\nAt the outskirts of the Mahyeon High School district.\nWhere Moon Chae-yeon’s underground hideout should be, an enormous tree now stood. Its size was immense, visible even from this distance.\nBut the trunk of the tree was anything but ordinary.\nCountless people were fused into it, as if their bodies had been absorbed, forming a grotesque, organic whole.\n“……?”\nWoo-jin tried to use his spatial leap to reach the tree, but for some reason, his unique ability wouldn’t activate.\n‘I can feel the magic inside me, but I can’t use it…’\nJust then.\n“!”\nThree of the tall creatures soaring through the city unfolded their wings and, in an instant, closed in on Woo-jin.\nThe creatures surrounded him.\nWoo-jin was caught off guard.\nThe three black-masked creatures stared at Woo-jin. Upon closer inspection, their \"masks\" weren’t masks at all but part of their skin. Their faces, made of something akin to keratin like nails or horns, glowed with red eyes—similar to Se-ah’s eyes when she unleashed her full power.\n“What… what the hell is going on…?”\nThe series of incomprehensible events left Woo-jin’s mind in disarray.\nThe creatures reached out their long arms toward him. He could feel the same power emanating from them as the one Se-ah had used.\n‘This power….’\nWoo-jin could guess what would happen if they touched him.\nThe twisted, flesh-colored beings roaming the city looked like they had lost their human forms. If this world was not the land of the living but the realm of the dead, then these creatures’ powers likely manipulated the shape of the soul, twisting it like they did the physical form.\nWoo-jin tried to escape their reach. He instinctively realized he could fly, and so he soared.\nHowever.\n“!”\nOne of the creatures flapped its wings and immediately caught up to Woo-jin.\nAs the mysterious power of Se-ah threatened to end everything right there—\nCrack!\nA crack formed behind Woo-jin, and a small hand reached out, grabbing his arm and pulling him through the gap. Woo-jin was dragged beyond the crack, and it closed behind him.\nThe creature's hand grasped only empty air.\nWhooosh!!\nWoo-jin emerged from the wormhole, finding himself in a vast field of goldmarig flowers.\nThe sky above was brighter than a sunset, glowing with a golden hue—a stark contrast to the terrifying cityscape he had just escaped from.\nIn the middle of the flower field stood a small cabin.\nAnd in front of that cabin.\nThud.\nWoo-jin, forcibly pulled along, lost his balance and fell flat on his back.\nThe one who had pulled him, Geumyang, clicked her tongue and looked down at him.\n“You really are a troublesome one, aren’t you?”\n“Geumyang…?”\n“This is my labyrinth. Only because you are who you are now could you enter.”\nWoo-jin pushed himself up, and Geumyang crouched down in front of him, knees drawn together, meeting his gaze.\nA gentle breeze stirred the golden flowers. Despite being called a \"labyrinth,\" the place felt overwhelmingly peaceful.\n“What… what just happened?”\nWoo-jin still couldn’t grasp the situation.\nWhen he had charged at Se-ah, her red eyes had suddenly flashed with a chilling light, and then he had been thrown into that strange world.\n“I told you, didn’t I? Run away. Ise-ah’s power isn’t something that can be judged or compared by the laws of the world. It’s in a realm beyond human understanding.”\nGeumyang shook her head in frustration, her tone exasperated.\n“I’m far older than you, yet you refuse to listen to me…. You really are just a rebellious kid in puberty. Well, it’s just as well. You haven’t died yet, and time is flowing very slowly for you right now.”\n“…You’ve figured something out, haven’t you?”\n“Hmph.”\nGeumyang stood up and walked toward the cabin.\n“Where are you going?”\n“How about we have some tea? Follow me.”\nWoo-jin stood up and followed her toward the cabin.\n“Sit there and wait.”\nGeumyang gestured toward a wooden table in front of the cabin. Woo-jin sat down in the chair by the table. Soon, Geumyang returned from inside the cabin with warm tea.\nTwo cups of what seemed to be green tea were placed on the table.\nIt had no scent.\nGeumyang took a seat across from Woo-jin, sniffing the tea and relaxing her expression. Woo-jin couldn’t understand what was so pleasant about a tea with no fragrance.\nWoo-jin looked down at his cup.\nHe had no desire to drink it.\nInstead, he turned his gaze toward the flower field filled with golden marigolds.\nThe wind gently swayed the golden petals, shimmering like sunlight.\nIt was an endless sea of flowers, too vast to see the end.\nHad it not been for the circumstances, he might have found it beautiful, an endless scene worth admiring.\n“Explain it to me. You’ve figured something out, haven’t you?”\n“I told you already, time in that world is flowing slowly. We can afford to take things easy. You’re always in a rush.”\nGeumyang set her cup down and looked at Woo-jin.\n“Well, I wasn’t sure before. That’s why I didn’t say anything. But now, I’m certain. I just hadn’t paid much attention to that place.”\n“What place?”\n“That city you saw.”\n“That city?”\n“Yes. That place is the ‘Otherworld.’ A realm that shouldn’t exist. It’s the domain of gods like me—or rather… to use human terms, it’s the realm of the divine. You don’t need to understand it.”\nGeumyang sipped her tea.\n“Neo Seoul has been twisted. It’s all the work of the Principal, I Doo-hee. He committed a crime no human should ever commit. He invited someone who should never have been brought here.”\nGeumyang continued.\n“His unique ability is ‘communication.’”\n“Communication?”\n“The name sounds pretty weak, doesn’t it? But it’s the ability to communicate with beings like me—other divine entities. It can’t be underestimated. If you can talk, you can negotiate.”\nGeumyang took another sip of tea, then continued while staring at her cup.\n“And that’s how the Principal was able to talk to gods with decent powers and get them to grant their abilities to people of his choosing. Your friend, Kim Dal-bi’s unique ability? That came from the Principal negotiating with the Goblin King. It was through an unfair contract that favored the Principal.”\nWoo-jin finally understood.\nGeumyang had settled Dal-bi’s cruel penalties by negotiating with the Goblin King.\n“Originally, unique abilities are fragments of power bestowed by beings like me.”\nThat was something Woo-jin had learned in a previous conversation with Geumyang.\nUnique abilities weren’t something you were born with; they were given later in life.\nJust as Geumyang had granted Woo-jin a portion of her power.\n“Why do beings like you give fragments of power to humans?”\n“Didn’t I tell you before? For fun. Pure amusement. Other entities might have different motives, but there’s no grand reason for it. It’s like how humans go to war sometimes out of anger or a desire for something better.”\n“……”\nWoo-jin didn’t argue. Human history had proven that true many times.\n“And that girl who’s always with the Principal—the one in the nun’s habit.”\n“Son Ye-seo.”\n“She can manipulate unique ability contracts. She can extract unique abilities, transfer them to someone else. If the god rejects it, it doesn’t work, but if the Principal steps in and negotiates, it’s settled. That’s how she managed to extract Obaekseo’s unique ability.”\n“Son Ye-seo.”\n“Tsk, picky kid. Son Ye-seo, Song Ye-seo, what does it matter? As long as we understand each other.”\nIn short.\nThe Principal and Son Ye-seo were capable of granting and exploiting unique abilities.\n“Anyway. The Principal has committed a grave sin.”\nGeumyang said solemnly.\n“He made a pact with someone, using the children he disposed of as a bargaining chip. And now, he’s created his own world in Neo Seoul, where he freely manipulates the souls of the dead.”\n“Who did he make a deal with? What kind of power does this being have?”\n“The power of manipulation. The being’s name is ‘Aktonom.’ Though you probably don’t need to know the name.”\nGeumyang continued.\n“Remember how Ise-ah resurrected the children who died during the first semester, as if turning back time? That’s the power of fate manipulation. It’s not just a common unique ability—it’s close to the true power of a god.”\n“So, ordinary unique abilities won’t be enough to fight it…”\n“It’s difficult. And the source of that power is the massive human tree you saw. Ise-ah doesn’t even need to use her own magic to fight. The primary fuel for that power is the children sacrificed by the Principal and the rebels deemed threats.”\nWoo-jin recalled the massive tree standing tall on the outskirts of Mahyeon High School's district, composed of human bodies.\n“So, there’s no cost for using that power. She’s not even using her own magic.”\nIt finally made sense why Se-ah had been able to use such a terrifying ability, resurrecting children, without showing any signs of exhaustion.\n“Is there no way to deal with that tree?”\n“With your strength, no miracle would be enough, and even with mine, I can’t guarantee it. It’s been carefully cultivated over many years, so it’s incredibly sturdy. There might be a way to reach its core, but it would take time to figure out. And in the meantime, those lanky creatures will be trying to stop you.”\n“It’s practically a cheat…”\nA unique ability that didn’t even use the wielder’s magic and drew from an almost infinite well of power.\nNo—calling it a unique ability was too simple.\nSe-ah’s power was more fittingly described as a “divine power.”\n“That’s why I told you to run. You’re up against something you can’t handle alone.”\n“The situation is far bigger than I imagined….”\n“I’d think you could have figured that out by now. Especially since you’re someone from another world.”\n“…What?”\nWoo-jin looked at Geumyang, his face filled with surprise.\n“You… you knew?”",

      "content": "Woo-jin was a reincarnated soul.\nHe had never revealed that fact to Geumyang.\n\"I just figured it out earlier,\" Geumyang said, shaking her head. \"I'm not like my true form, able to know everything. I recognized it when I saw your soul. A normal soul wouldn’t have the imprint of my true form engraved on it.\"\n\"An imprint?\"\n\"My true form is the one who sent you here. I bet it even planned for you and me to meet.\"\nWoo-jin narrowed his eyes.\n\"So... Hwanggeumyang reincarnated me?\"\n\"I'm certain of it. It had to be my true form that sent you to this world.\"\nIt wasn’t surprising that a 9th-tier creature—one at the pinnacle of all existence—could perform miracles, but he had never expected that his reincarnation into this world was the work of Hwanggeumyang.\n\"Did you know about this world?\" Geumyang asked.\n\"There was a game in my past life. It was based on this world.\"\n\"A game, huh? The most intuitive way to convey information. My true form probably had someone create it. It’s obvious, isn’t it?\"\n\"Then why me...?\"\n\"Don't ask.\"\nGeumyang sighed, resting her chin on her hand.\n\"As I said before, I don’t know what my true form is thinking. Why it reincarnated you specifically, why it had us meet, why all of this was set into motion…. I don’t even know why it left this world after fighting those Argonauts. But there's one thing I am sure of.\"\n\"...To defeat the Principal and Se-ah.\"\n\"You've got it.\"\nEven though Woo-jin didn’t fully understand Hwanggeumyang’s intent, he could guess that it was to take down Se-ah and the Principal, who had disrupted the world’s order.\n\"Your fight wasn't just about the fate of Neo Seoul. The stakes were much higher than that.\"\n\"Enough. I don’t need grand speeches. They don’t feel real to me anyway.\"\nWoo-jin stood up.\n\"I'm just breaking what’s in my way because I want to live my life peacefully.\"\nHe thought of the daily life he had shared with Kim Dal-bi as a child, the moments spent with Obaekseo after becoming the Disciplinary Committee president, and the random conversations with the other committee members.\nWoo-jin simply wanted to live freely and happily.\nAnd to achieve that, he would bring down Se-ah.\n\"What are you planning to do?\"\n\"You said it’s called the Otherworld? I’ll find a way out and face Ise-ah again. There’s no way a 9th-tier being reincarnated me just to face an enemy I can't defeat alone.\"\n\"Oh? You’re willing to trust the true form without knowing its intentions?\"\n\"It seems like you didn’t quite understand me.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nWoo-jin looked back at Geumyang.\n\"Hwanggeumyang doesn’t only have you as a fragment, right?\"\n\"...Hah. You’re a funny one.\"\nFinally, Geumyang realized what Woo-jin was thinking.\n\"Are you planning to team up with Goliath?\"\nGoliath. The man known as the strongest in Neo Seoul.\nAnd, like Woo-jin, someone blessed by Hwanggeumyang.\n\"Goliath said he’d watch to see who was on the right side for Neo Seoul. And now that Se-ah’s power has been fully revealed, there’s no way he’ll stay idle. He’ll come—no question about it. I don’t know if we’ll fight together, but it’s worth the gamble.\"\n\"...\"\n\"So, call your friend—the one who gave Goliath his power—\"\n\"Who are you calling a friend!?\"\nGeumyang slammed the table and stood up, fuming. She seethed with anger.\n\"There are levels to these fragments! I’m of a much higher level…!\"\n\"Yeah, that fragment.\"\n\"Good grief! Well, fine. I get what you're thinking.\"\nCrack!\nGeumyang opened a crack in the air next to her.\n\"But who knows when that guy will actually—\"\n[It’s been a while.]\n\"Oh, my!\"\nGeumyang stumbled back in surprise.\nBarely three seconds had passed before a 3-meter-tall goat-headed creature in a suit appeared through the crack.\nHe was another fragment of Hwanggeumyang and the one who had granted Goliath his power—the Golden Goat of Gravity.\n\"Why are you showing up like you were just waiting for a call!?\" Geumyang exclaimed.\n[With my brilliant intellect, I deduced that you’d call sooner or later, given the circumstances. You should be grateful.]\n\"Brilliant intellect? What’s your IQ, even? Over 100?\"\n[According to my last test, my IQ is 120. That’s much higher than most goats.]\nThe goat-headed creature boasted proudly.\nWoo-jin was baffled—wasn’t 120 just a normal IQ for a human? He thought this in confusion.\n\"Why are you comparing yourself to goats…?\"\n[Because I am a goat. What’s your IQ? Does it even reach 100?]\n\"I, uh, I’ve never tested it, so… I don’t know….\"\nGeumyang fiddled with her fingers awkwardly.\n\"In any case, it’s absurd to use a human IQ test to measure my intelligence! It’s disgraceful to take pride in such numbers…!\"\nGeumyang fumed.\n[Enough of that.]\n\"You started it!\"\n[Let me introduce myself.]\nThe goat-headed creature bowed slightly to Woo-jin.\n[I am the Golden Goat of Gravity. Like the Golden Goat of Space here, I am a fragment of Hwanggeumyang.]\n\"Do I even need an introduction?\"\nThe Golden Goat of Gravity shook his head.\n[I already know you. There’s no need for long explanations.]\nHe stepped toward Woo-jin and extended his hand toward Woo-jin's chest, golden energy flowing from his hand.\nGeumyang looked at him suspiciously, while Woo-jin felt no physical sensation, only confusion.\n\"What are you doing?\"\nSssss.\nSoon, the golden energy receded from the goat-headed creature’s hand.\nHe lowered his arm.\n[It’s done. You’ll now return to where you came from.]\n\"What?\"\n[I used my blessing on you. My blessing is ‘Ultra Regeneration.’ It can only be used once in a lifetime.]\nWoo-jin’s eyes widened.\nHe had just received Goliath’s one and only blessing.\nSsssss.\nFrom his feet upward, Woo-jin’s body began to dissolve into golden dust. Woo-jin stared in shock.\n\"My body…?\"\n[Now that you’re in normal condition again, you can no longer stay here. This is not a place for living humans.]\nGeumyang sat back down, resting her chin on her hand, clicking her tongue.\n\"How unpredictable…\"\nBut she seemed relieved deep down.\n\"What about Goliath? His blessing…?\"\n[Since I used the blessing on you, my charge can no longer access it. It was his wish.]\nWoo-jin stared at his dissolving hand. The sensation remained, but the hand itself had vanished.\n\"Looks like I owe him.\"\n[You’re mistaken. This is all to fulfill my charge’s desire. In fact, Goliath had no intention of using Ultra Regeneration. He said that if he ever faced a life-threatening situation, he’d accept it as his fate.]\nThat sounded just like Goliath.\n[Now, go.]\nWoo-jin looked between the Golden Goat of Gravity and the Golden Goat of Space.\n\"Kid.\"\nGeumyang, still resting her chin on her hand, gazed at Woo-jin and spoke calmly.\n\"Win. We’ll take care of the tree.\"\nBy now, only Woo-jin’s head remained.\nWoo-jin nodded.\n\"Count on it.\"\nSsssss.\nWoo-jin closed his eyes, and his body completely disappeared.\nOnly the fresh golden marigold petals swirled in the space where he had once stood.\nThe Golden Goat of Gravity turned to Geumyang.\n[That tree is something Aktonom put a lot of effort into. Can you destroy it?]\n\"I don’t know… We’ll have to try. But at least we know my true form is paying attention to this matter.\"\n[Don’t worry. With your IQ of 100 and my IQ of 120, we should be able to figure something out.]\nGeumyang frowned.\n\"…Are you an idiot?\"\n[What’s wrong?]\n\"My IQ is not 100, and you can’t just add IQs together…. Never mind. Explaining it to you is a waste of time.\"\nGeumyang snorted with laughter and stood up.\nCrack!\nA new crack opened amid the golden marigold field.\n\"Let’s get going. My charge is working hard, so we can’t slack off.\"\n[Indeed.]\nTogether, Geumyang and the Golden Goat of Gravity stepped into the crack and vanished.\nThe Principal’s Office.\nIt was right after Woo-jin had collapsed while charging at Ise-ah.\nThe Principal stared blankly, watching Woo-jin’s sudden death.\nAt that moment, Se-ah’s phone buzzed. She checked the message and smiled before turning to the Principal.\n\"Principal, let’s leave for now. We’ve retrieved Ye-seo as well. She’s still breathing, so why don’t you come with us?\"\n\"My daughter… I’m sorry for failing…\"\n\"Oh, Principal, you’ve done so much for me. I’m only grateful.\"\n\"Thank you for saying so….\"\nTears welled up in the Principal’s eyes.\nSoon, the office door opened, and two members of Dohwa’s organization entered. One of them was Lee Jeong-mi, a member of the Student Council's audit department.\nJeong-mi brought a new wheelchair.\n\"Jeong-mi, please take care of this.\"\n\"Yes, as you command.\"\nJeong-mi and her colleague lifted the immobilized Principal into the new wheelchair and left the office.\nNow, only Se-ah and Woo-jin’s fallen body remained in the Principal’s Office.\nSe-ah approached Woo-jin and looked down at him with a sorrowful expression.\n\"Senior…, I told you not to look into my eyes. Once you make eye contact with me, you’re sent to a world you can never return from. Of course, you couldn’t have known.\"\nAnyone who looked directly into Se-ah’s eyes when she unleashed her power would meet the same fate as Woo-jin.\nHer ability was to transport anyone who made eye contact with her to Neo Seoul’s Otherworld.\nEscaping from the creatures there was almost impossible, making it a one-way ticket to death.\n\"I’ll make you a grave, Senior….\"\nBut then.\nSe-ah’s eyes widened, and she immediately looked up.\nA tremendous magical power was descending from the top of the Central Tower. Something unknown was falling fast.\nAnd then.\nBoom!!\nA powerful gravity descended, crushing the upper levels of the Central Tower, causing it to collapse.\nThe ceiling crumbled, and Se-ah quickly leaped back, using her magic to deflect the falling debris.\nThud!!\nIn front of Woo-jin.\nA towering man broke through the dust and landed in the Principal’s Office.\nHe grinned widely, flashing large, menacing teeth.\nThe debris that was falling on Woo-jin was suddenly compressed and scattered harmlessly, leaving Woo-jin untouched.\nSe-ah glared at the man, recognizing him as a powerful adversary.\nA low growl, like that of a beast, rumbled from the man’s chest.\nHe stood up, shaking off the dust.\nLong blonde hair, bulging muscles.\nA man standing 2.3 meters tall.\nThe strongest in Neo Seoul and a monster who roamed the world freely.\n\"Now this… looks interesting! Hahahaha!\"\nGoliath.\nHe laughed heartily as he faced Se-ah.\n\"Goliath… I didn’t expect you to show up here….\"\nSe-ah, astonished, gestured toward the ceiling.\n\"How did you break through this? With the jammer in place, the flow of magic should be cut off, making it impossible to use magic to destroy….\"\n\"Heh, I smashed it with my fists…!\"\nGoliath held up a massive fist wrapped in old bandages.\n\"Ah~. Of course. I should’ve known better than to judge you by common sense.\"\nSe-ah smiled slyly, narrowing her eyes.\n\"But why are you here? Weren’t you just a bystander?\"\n\"Don’t you dare try to define me with one word…!\"\nGoliath threatened her with his booming voice.\nHe stretched out his massive arms, flexing his muscles.\nThe crack in the sky that had lingered since Woo-jin’s death was now gone.\nWith the upper floors of the Central Tower collapsed, the moonlight poured down, illuminating Goliath in a beautiful glow.\n\"I’ve just been watching. Watching to see who’s even a little bit more right for this city…!\"\n\"I see… That makes sense. You were always an unpredictable wild card.\"\nSe-ah’s eyes gradually opened, revealing her eerie red pupils.\n\"So? It looks like you’ve made your decision.\"\nShe tilted her head and pointed at her face with both index fingers, wearing a playful smile.\n\"Are you really going to say I’m not the right one? Even though you don’t know what kind of world I plan to create?\"\n\"You.\"\nGoliath grinned and pointed a finger at Se-ah.\n\"Are a rotten piece of trash.\"\nA crack appeared in Se-ah’s playful smile for a brief moment. She quickly regained her composure, returning to her sly grin.\n\"Well, I guess there’s no helping it. I’ve always found you to be soooo irritating… Shall we settle this here and now…? Huh?\"\nAt that moment, something astonishing happened.\nWoo-jin, lying on the ground, grabbed his Cheolryong-gon and began to rise.\nHis head hung low.\nHe stumbled briefly, weak from the strain, but soon regained his balance.\nWoo-jin stood fully upright.\nSe-ah’s eyes widened in disbelief.\n\"How…? Senior…?\"\nWoo-jin lifted his head.\nHis eyes, shadowed by the dim light, gleamed coldly with their familiar turquoise hue as he stared icily at Se-ah.",

      "content": "Crackle!\nA teal electric current surged through the Cheolryong-gon gripped by Woo-jin. Though he had briefly died and been transported to the Otherworld, his internal mana reserves were still plentiful.\nWoo-jin stood beside Goliath, and the two of them assumed battle stances, facing Se-ah.\n\"Huh...? What’s going on...? Huh...?\" Se-ah asked, awkwardly smiling as confusion took hold of her.\nWoo-jin looked calm, as though he had already made sense of the situation. Goliath simply grinned as if everything was going according to plan. It was as if they had predicted this outcome.\nNow, Se-ah was the one struggling to understand what was happening.\n\"It seems... you’re not in the mood for conversation, are you?\" Se-ah gave up trying to make sense of the situation and steeled herself for battle.\n\"Goliath.\"\n\"What?\" Goliath answered, his voice brimming with amusement.\n\"I owe you one,\" Woo-jin said.\n\"Shut up. I woke you for my own reasons!\" Goliath retorted.\n\"Sigh... Listen carefully. When her eyes glow weirdly, don’t—\"\n\"Hahaha!! Let’s do this!!\" Goliath cut Woo-jin off with a roar, launching himself forward with a leap.\n\"Can’t you at least let me finish...!\" Woo-jin frowned, chasing after him.\nWhoosh!\nSe-ah’s red eyes began to glow menacingly once more.\nBut in that moment—\nCrack!\n\"……!\"\nSe-ah gasped in surprise.\nBefore her, a spatial rift appeared, and Woo-jin and Goliath both vanished into it, retreating into the subspace just as her eyes flared with power.\nBoth men had the protection of the Golden Goat. Moreover, Woo-jin already knew that Goliath could travel through his rifts, something he had learned in the first semester.\nGoliath, for his part, had anticipated that Woo-jin would support him, so he moved confidently, seemingly ignoring Woo-jin’s warning but, in truth, fully trusting him.\nCrack!\nBehind Se-ah and to her left, new rifts suddenly opened. Woo-jin and Goliath shot out of them like bullets.\nSe-ah’s powers, which sent opponents to the Otherworld, faltered in the face of their swift and coordinated assault.\nCrackle!\nWoo-jin’s Cheolryong-gon, crackling with teal lightning, and Goliath’s enormous fist, wrapped in a powerful gravitational field, simultaneously struck.\nBoom!\nThe explosive impact of the electric shockwave and the gravitational force shattered Se-ah’s body, sending her flying like a ragdoll.\nThe destructive arc of Goliath’s punch created a powerful gravitational shockwave that dented and pierced the thick walls of the Central Tower.\nSe-ah was thrown out of the building, sent hurtling far into the distance.\n'Even with that kind of power, you’re not invincible,' Woo-jin thought, recalling the original storyline.\nIn the original story, Se-ah had died. If her death had been at Baek-seo’s hands, it was likely that Se-ah had been assassinated without even realizing it.\nNo matter how powerful Se-ah’s abilities were, they were not truly hers.\nSe-ah was still human.\nThat meant she could be defeated.\nBesides, with both Woo-jin and Goliath able to teleport at will, even Se-ah wouldn’t be able to handle them easily.\nWhoosh!\nAs Se-ah’s body flew through the air, crimson mana suddenly wrapped around her.\nThen, something unnatural happened.\nHer body, which had been flying away, abruptly stopped and began to reverse course, like a video playing in reverse.\nSwish!\nCrimson mana filled Se-ah’s form once again, rapidly healing the fatal injuries she had sustained.\n\"……!\"\nBoom!\nAt the same time, a sudden shockwave erupted from the spot where Se-ah had been moments before she was struck.\nWoo-jin and Goliath, caught off guard, raised their arms to shield their faces as the shockwave slammed them into the walls of the Central Tower.\nThe force was relatively weak. It merely knocked them back without causing significant harm.\nIn other words, it wasn’t an attack.\n'I see...,' Woo-jin thought.\nIt was an extremely unnatural phenomenon.\nHe recalled what Geumyang had explained about Se-ah’s powers and began to understand the basic principle behind them.\n'She erased the fact that we hit her, altering reality so that she merely leaped out of the building.'\nHer unique ability,\nDestiny Recalibration\n.\nMagic Formula Type 1:\nCausal Replacement\n.\n'She’s outright ignoring the laws of the world.'\nIt was truly a power beyond reason.\nEven in a world filled with fantastical abilities, Woo-jin now understood why Geumyang had said that Se-ah’s power defied all common sense.\nTo defeat Se-ah, they would need to either knock her unconscious in one strike or kill her instantly.\nThe recent surprise attack by Woo-jin and Goliath had been effective but had not completely overwhelmed Se-ah. The Otherworld’s power had protected her.\n\"Hah...!\"\nSe-ah frowned, her body now fully healed.\n\"You two are strong, as expected….\"\nIt had taken a coordinated assault by the two strongest fighters in Neo Seoul, and even then, Se-ah couldn’t avoid injury completely.\n\"I guess I’ll have to go all out, then.\"\nSe-ah smiled slyly, spreading her arms wide.\nBehind her, a crimson ring of mana appeared, and numerous human-shaped figures made of red energy extended outward, forming wings.\nWhoosh!\nAs her wings flapped, powerful gusts of wind rippled out.\nAn eerie, radiant glow began to emanate from Se-ah.\n\"What... is that?\"\n\"Freakish…\"\nSe-ah floated in the center of the Central Area, drawing the attention of everyone nearby.\nJournalists, who had been capturing footage from a distance, zoomed in with their cameras to record the eerie light radiating from Se-ah.\nCivilians, watching from their windows or via live streams, gawked in shock at the unearthly spectacle.\n\"It’s like… that’s not the power of one person. It feels like the energy of a multitude…,\" the president of Saein High’s student council muttered.\nThe mana surrounding Se-ah carried the life force of many people.\nA terrifying aura spread across Neo Seoul.\nAnyone ranked 5th tier or higher could immediately sense how grotesque and unnatural that red mana was.\nSomething that should never have existed had revealed itself to the world.\nBam! Bam!\nIn response, Dohwa’s brainwashed soldiers, who had been lying in wait, leaped into action. Their eyes glowed red, a sign of their enslavement to Se-ah’s will.\nCrimson rings and wings, smaller in size but similar to Se-ah’s, manifested behind the soldiers.\nThey formed a defensive perimeter around Se-ah. A sickening aura crawled up Woo-jin’s spine.\n\"So, she brought fifty soldiers, huh…!\"\nStanding in front of the gaping hole in the wall, Woo-jin and Goliath stared at Se-ah and her soldiers.\n\"You think you can take me on with just that?! You pathetic trash, don’t underestimate me…!\"\n\"Watch out for their eyes. They might all have the same power as Se-ah.\"\n\"Hmph! No need to explain…! I’m already aware…!\"\n\"Good, then.\"\nWoo-jin extended his right arm toward Se-ah, while Goliath stretched out his left. Mana infused with their respective abilities surged from their hands.\nCrack!\n\"……!\"\nA massive rift appeared in the sky once more.\nAnother crack formed in the ground below. Debris, rubble, and soil from the destroyed structures flowed into the crack.\nEverything fell toward the sky.\nBoom!\nBut that wasn’t all.\nA powerful gravitational force emerged from the rift Woo-jin had created in the sky. As a result, the falling debris accelerated, and the smaller fragments became as deadly as bullets.\nAt the same time, Goliath skillfully infused the debris with intense gravity. Anything that touched those fragments would be crushed and destroyed.\nEach falling piece of debris had become a lethal weapon.\nAnyone within Woo-jin’s\nHeaven’s Subjugation\nfield was guaranteed instant death.\nBut Se-ah wasn’t going down that easily.\n\"Are you trying to wipe me out all at once because I might be dangerous?\"\nDespite the overwhelming gravitational force trying to pull her down, Se-ah floated effortlessly in the air. Her crimson mana created a force that countered the pull of gravity.\nHer unique ability,\nDestiny Recalibration\n.\nMagic Formula Type 2:\nLaw Reconfiguration\n.\nSe-ah had rewritten the natural laws to oppose the gravitational force generated by Goliath’s magic.\n\"That attack is beyond my reach….\"\nSe-ah couldn’t manipulate the gravity that Goliath had unleashed on such a massive scale. No matter how powerful her authority was, her body couldn’t handle the density of the mana Goliath was wielding.\nIt was a testament to how overwhelmingly strong Goliath was.\nThe soldiers, though protected by Se-ah, couldn’t completely avoid the effects of Goliath’s gravity. Their movements were hindered.\nCrack!\nBoom!\nDozens of cracks formed around Se-ah, and from them, gigantic lightning bolts shot toward her.\nSe-ah sensed the cracks’ angles and positions in advance and managed to dodge, but the lightning relentlessly pursued her, zigzagging through the rifts.\nEventually, Se-ah extended her hand toward the oncoming lightning.\nSwish!\nSuddenly, the spatial lightning reversed direction, fizzling out soon after. Its path had been altered.\nOnce again, Magic Formula Type 2:\nLaw Reconfiguration\n.\n'Her recalibration ability… What’s the condition?' Woo-jin thought as he teleported through the falling debris.\n'In the first semester, she used it on people who had died to manipulate the fact that they had been killed. Now, she’s using it to counter my lightning and the debris. She hasn’t done anything to me or Goliath directly, though, so contact isn’t a requirement.'\nWoo-jin quickly arrived at a conclusion.\n'She can’t use it on living beings.'\nIt seemed unlikely that she would be able to manipulate either him or Goliath anytime soon.\n'She can’t touch my spatial jumps either… Maybe it’s because she can’t handle the mana within the wormhole?'\nThe wormhole he traveled through for teleportation, as Geumyang had once explained, was a realm densely packed with an extraordinary amount of mana.\nEven Se-ah’s powers likely couldn’t cope with it.\nCrack!\nWoo-jin and Goliath teleported through new cracks, instantly closing the distance between themselves and Se-ah.\nFrom both sides, they aimed their Cheolryong-gon and fists at her.\nThe moment they closed in, Dohwa’s soldiers rushed in to shield Se-ah, taking the blows in her place.\nBoom!\nThe soldiers were flung backward with incredible force, crashing into various parts of the Central Tower.\nMeanwhile, Se-ah extended her arms toward Woo-jin and Goliath. Crimson mana surged forward, silently creeping toward them like an assassin.\nA sense of danger pricked at Woo-jin’s spine.\nReacting swiftly, he activated a rift he had prepared for emergencies, escaping into the subspace along with Goliath.\n\"Hmm…. I hate to say this to you, Senior, but you’re like a rat. I could’ve finished this just now.\"\nThe power of the Otherworld.\nGenetic manipulation.\nHad they been caught by that, both Woo-jin and Goliath’s bodies would have twisted into grotesque shapes.\nDohwa’s soldiers, their crimson wings spread wide, swarmed after Woo-jin and Goliath whenever they reappeared from the cracks, engaging them in fierce combat.\nEvery time Se-ah flew toward Woo-jin, another intense battle would break out.\nSe-ah, now fully enveloped in crimson mana, had greatly enhanced her physical abilities. Even a light swing of her arm caused a violent tearing sound, sending shockwaves that struck Woo-jin with crushing force.\nHer power far exceeded the 7th tier. Woo-jin felt the bones in his body breaking from the sheer impact.\nBut whenever Woo-jin was in danger, Goliath would leap in, his gravity-infused punches sending Se-ah flying away.\nDebris rained down on Se-ah, infused with even more mana and speed, making it impossible for her to deflect them using her law-rewriting ability.\nEach time, Se-ah flapped her wings, dodging swiftly.\nConversely, whenever Goliath was in trouble, Woo-jin would create a rift to pull him out or unleash several spatial lightning bolts to strike Se-ah.\n\"You two are really in sync, aren’t you?\"\nAmid the fierce and destructive battle, Se-ah scoffed in frustration.\nMeanwhile, Dohwa’s soldiers relentlessly attacked Woo-jin and Goliath.\n'All of them have physical abilities similar to Se-ah’s.'\nSe-ah, using the power of the Otherworld, possessed physical capabilities far beyond the 7th tier.\nThe soldiers she controlled were no different. While not as strong as Se-ah herself, they posed a significant threat with physical abilities comparable to the 7th tier.\nSplurt!\nHowever, as the battle dragged on, the soldiers’ bodies began to split and bleed, unable to fully handle the power they wielded.\nTheir expressions remained emotionless.\nThey showed no signs of pain or hesitation.\nThey were nothing more than marionettes.\nFighting off a horde of such opponents was proving to be overwhelming for Woo-jin.\nCrack!\nWoo-jin and Goliath slipped into another rift, entering the same wormhole.\nWoo-jin had intentionally brought Goliath along with him.\n\"Huff, huff….\"\nWoo-jin clutched his broken ribs, gasping for breath.\n\"Fighting while avoiding eye contact is harder than I thought.\"\nThere’s a saying that the eyes are the windows to the soul.\nIn all his previous battles, Woo-jin had relied on subtle changes in his opponent’s eyes and facial expressions to predict their movements.\nBut now, against Se-ah and her soldiers, he couldn’t afford to make eye contact.\nOn top of that, Se-ah’s physical strength was so overwhelming that even a simple swing of her arm generated winds strong enough to crush bones.\nWithout even trying, she could deliver devastating blows, making it difficult for Woo-jin to keep up with her movements.\nSe-ah’s attacks were too much for even someone with 7th-tier abilities to withstand.\n\"Hehehe…!\"\nGoliath, though injured as well, grinned, thoroughly enjoying the fight.\n\"Isn’t this fun? When will you ever get to experience something like this again? This is a refreshing challenge! Hahaha!!\"\n\"You’re such an annoying bastard, but I guess it’s good you’re staying positive.\"\nWoo-jin chuckled.\n\"If we don’t stop Se-ah, it’s over. She’s revealed her power, and there’s no way she won’t make her move. She’s definitely planning something.\"\n\"I know…! I have no intention of losing. I will personally take down that trash…!\"\nGoliath grinned, cracking his knuckles. His fighting spirit was burning brighter than ever.\n\"They said they’d try to do something about Se-ah’s power source on the other side. I don’t know if they’ll succeed, but we have to hope for the best.\"\n\"If all else fails, I’ll use my trump card…!\"\n\"Yeah, go ahead and go wild. I’ll cover you.\"\n\"You’ll cover\nme\n?\"\nGoliath raised an eyebrow, intrigued by Woo-jin’s words.\n\"And you cover\nme\n.\"\n\"Hehehe! You cheeky brat… You say interesting things…!\"\n\"Let’s go.\"\nWoo-jin and Goliath charged through the wormhole, emerging once again to confront Se-ah.",

      "content": "Central Tower, deep underground.\nIncluding Lee Jung-mi, the remaining members of the Dohwa faction were fleeing, carrying the pained Principal and the unconscious Song Ye-seo.\n‘We need to regroup as soon as possible to support Se-ah.’\nThe Principal was desperate.\n‘If we don’t make it through here soon, the escape route might collapse… Or we’ll have to wait until the battle ends and cross the center area torn open like the wastelands. If that happens, we won’t be able to shake off Ahn Woo-jin…!’\nThey had to pass through the escape route quickly.\nIt wasn’t that the Principal lacked confidence in escaping from Woo-jin; it was that avoiding him was an impossible task.\nAs they rushed with the help of the Dohwa faction members,\n“Where do you think you’re rushing off to?”\nInside the escape route.\nA female student, freed from her restraints, stood in their way.\nBehind her, an unfamiliar mechanical wall blocked the entire exit.\nThe Principal furrowed his brows fiercely when he recognized the familiar face of the student.\n“Moon Chae-yeon… Why are you here…?” “The head of the discipline committee from Ahseong High swept away all the dangerous people here, didn’t he? So I came in comfortably~.”\nThe girl blocking the exit, Moon Chae-yeon, chuckled with a mischievous smile.\n“But wow…! Principal, what’s with this sorry state!? You really got beaten up, didn’t you? In the end, even you ended up like this! Oh wow, our master must be thrilled! Ah~, Ahn Woo-jin is growing on me more and more!”\n“Moon Chae-yeon….”\n“This is the underground escape route, right? Geez, I was really impressed by how deep it was down here. If Ahn Woo-jin sucked you in all the way down here, that would’ve been a total disaster, huh?”\n“…Step aside.”\n“Oh, don’t you get it? Can’t you see the wall blocking the way behind me?”\n“You… you’re just trash that was discarded like a worthless piece…!”\nKagakakakak!\nSuddenly, all of the Dohwa faction members except for Lee Jung-mi began to swell.\nRed magical armor appeared, enveloping their bodies.\nThey glared at Chae-yeon with feral eyes, growling like beasts.\n“Please stay calm, Principal. We will protect you.”\nJung-mi stepped forward and spoke.\n“Moon Chae-yeon, if you don’t move, we will kill you.”\n“So… you weren’t ordinary humans after all. And that magic isn’t even yours, is it?”\nChae-yeon sneered.\n“The ones fighting outside were completely controlled by that black-haired girl, right? They became strong but turned into mere puppets. You’re not quite at that level, huh? That means you’re weak, aren’t you?”\n“Even so, you cannot defeat us.”\n“Yeah, yeah. No more words needed then. So….”\nSwish.\nAs Chae-yeon swept her hand in front of her face, a protector covered her eyes.\nMagic surged around her, forming mechanical armor around her body, and in one hand, a mechanical spear appeared.\n“Let’s have some fun.”\nChae-yeon’s constantly smiling face twisted.\n“I’ve been waiting for this moment for so long.”\nShe recalled the time she nearly died at Woo-jin’s hands and the burning desire that had consumed her ever since.\n─ ‘You want revenge, don’t you?’\nJust as Woo-jin had said.\nThe desire to brutally kill the Principal.\nThat unspoken wish was what had kept her going.\n‘How pathetic… my life is truly worthless.’\nChae-yeon let out a self-mocking laugh.\nUnconsciously, Woo-jin’s face flashed through her mind.\nShe didn’t like him, maybe even hated him.\nBut he was the strange man who made her heart flutter.\nNow, she fully understood why Kim Dal-bi and Oh Baek-seo had fallen for Woo-jin so hard.\nMaybe if she had loved someone, her dirty, miserable life could have been a little more beautiful.\n‘What am I even thinking?’\nShe brushed aside the foolish thoughts and reminded herself of why she was here.\nThe Principal could not be allowed to pass.\nThe Principal’s destination was where Woo-jin was.\n‘Hey, Ahn Woo-jin. I won’t let the Principal pass, so you can relax.’\nChae-yeon decided to stake her life and her desire on Woo-jin.\n“Moon Chae-yeon!!!”\nThe Principal, his face flushed with anger, screamed.\n“Hehe!”\nChae-yeon laughed brightly as she charged toward the Dohwa faction members.\nMeanwhile, in the Reversed World.\n“Hah… Hah….”\nGeumyang and the Golden Sheep of Gravity stood before the massive human tree that fueled Se-ah’s power.\n“That thing’s damn sturdy!”\nGeumyang cursed in frustration.\nNo matter how much power they used, the massive tree wouldn’t budge.\nOnly the human-like shapes forming the tree’s trunk could be harmed, which only added to their frustration.\n[There must be a core somewhere. Something that sustains this tree.]\n“Don’t you think I know that? But I can’t figure out where it is…!”\nMonstrous creatures began to interfere with Geumyang and the Golden Sheep of Gravity.\nBut with a single gesture from the Golden Sheep, gravity pressed down, smashing the creatures into the ground.\nAs the gravity intensified, the ground warped, and the creatures were pulverized into pieces.\n“There’s no time. We have to do something…!”\nAt that moment.\nStep. Step.\nA figure in a hooded robe began to approach.\nGeumyang and the Golden Sheep were shocked to see an intact human figure coming closer.\n“You…?”\nThe girl wearing a shattered skull mask.\nGeumyang recognized her.\nIt was the one Woo-jin had defeated in the first semester.\n“I greet the avatars of the Golden Sheep.”\nIt was Han Seo-jin, the Hexagons’ sinner.\nShe bowed respectfully to the two avatars.\n[Who is this?] “She’s the one my servant defeated last time.”\nSeo-jin’s face was as expressionless as ever.\n“You. How did you come here?” “I learned the art of necromancy. My ability lends itself to such things.”\nSeo-jin looked up at the massive human tree.\n“After I was defeated by Director Woo-jin, I became a spirit. And I came to understand the truth of this world. I also learned that Director Woo-jin bears the mark of the Golden Sheep. Well…, I did meet the Golden Sheep while we fought.”\n“…….”\n“So now I know that Director Woo-jin came from another world. Maybe everything that happened to me was predetermined.”\nSeo-jin stepped forward, facing the human tree.\n“What are you planning?” “Ever since I learned the truth, I’ve been investigating this tree.”\n“…Is that why you were gone for so long?” “Yes.”\nSeo-jin stopped and pointed to the human tree, glancing at Geumyang.\n“I know the way to reach the core of this tree.”\n“What…?”\nGeumyang’s eyes widened.\n“I discovered a path to the core during my investigations. I’ve worked quite hard on this, you know.”\n“Why? What’s your reason for doing this…?” “Well, just…”\nSeo-jin looked at the tree again.\n“After fighting with Director Woo-jin, I realized something. I just wanted to live. So I found a reason to keep living. It had become seeing the ocean. But I knew long ago that there was no longer a beautiful blue ocean. I just needed a reason to keep going.”\n“And now you don’t want to live anymore?” “I’m not sure. But some of the people in this tree… I know their faces. At least I had a reason to live. But these people, they died without even that.”\nSeo-jin spoke in a flat, emotionless tone.\n“I’ve finally accepted that my reason for living will never come true. And then, I saw something new. It was these people. I realized I could help them. And for the first time, my life felt like it had purpose.”\nSeo-jin’s body began to dissolve into a dark purple mist, starting from her feet.\n“Life is so tragically fleeting.”\nSeo-jin turned her head to look at Geumyang, a faint smile forming on her usually emotionless face.\n“Tell Director Woo-jin for me. I was really grateful that he called me awesome. Thanks for giving me good memories to carry with me.”\nSeo-jin turned back to the human tree.\n“I’ll atone for my sins this way.”\nSwish.\nFinally, Seo-jin’s body completely transformed into a serene, dark purple energy and took the shape of a graceful deer, racing through the air.\nThe magical deer shot toward the human tree, disappearing into its depths.\nBoom!\nMoments later, the spot where Seo-jin’s energy penetrated exploded, creating a path.\n“You fool… Was that your choice…?”\nGeumyang clicked his tongue in pity.\nThere was no time to just stand and watch.\nThe magical path Seo-jin had carved was already beginning to fade, unable to withstand the overwhelming pressure within the tree.\n“…Let’s go.” [Indeed.]\nGeumyang used spatial teleportation, and the Golden Sheep of Gravity floated up, entering the path Seo-jin had created.\nThey moved swiftly down the magical passage.\nMeanwhile, in a dark alley somewhere in Neo Seoul.\nSeo-jin’s physical body sat slumped against a wall, her eyes gently closed. Her body, starting from her feet, slowly dissolved into dark purple energy, turning into glowing dust.\nIt was the last of her magical power.\nLike a child dreaming a peaceful dream, the corners of her mouth lifted into a slight smile.\nGradually, her head drooped, and her hair slid down in a soft cascade.\nEventually, the last of her magical energy consumed her, scattering her into the wind.\nLike petals.",

      "content": "Lee Se-ah let out a bitter laugh.\n“Wow…! When did everyone go from baring their fangs at each other to now coming together so harmoniously? It’s so fake that I can’t help but laugh.”\nGwoooarrrr!\nThe numerous lives contained within the magical wings on Se-ah’s back screamed, growing in size.\n“Even if all of you join forces, you won’t be able to defeat me.”\nSe-ah’s wings, now large enough to cover part of the sky, sprouted countless eyes. Each red pupil scanned the surroundings.\nThe red ring that had formed behind Se-ah also grew larger, slowly ascending into the sky, emitting a sacred light.\nThe ring, like a mosquito coil, gradually disintegrated, flickering and glitching like a broken TV screen or a bugged video game, a foreboding sign.\nThe soft glow that had been emanating from Se-ah intensified, forming a halo of light.\nAll the students in the center area could sense that the disappearing red ring was some sort of countdown.\nGoooohhh!\nThe ominous magic, accompanied by countless screams, engulfed the area.\n“What is that?”\n“It’s a power that can ignore the laws of the world and rewrite everything without limit. If you get directly hit by it, you’ll be close to death.”\nSe-ah responded to Woo-jin’s question with a sly smile.\n“You…”\n“At this rate, things won’t work out. I need to change everything. Care to try and stop me, senior?”\nHer unique ability:\nFate Recalibration\n. Secret technique:\nMagical Formula Type 5, Paradox Creation\n.\nNo one knew exactly what would happen, but it was clear that immense chaos would descend upon the world.\nPaaahhh!\nAn overwhelming amount of magic surged, sweeping across the area like a powerful wind. However, Woo-jin and Goliath didn’t budge.\n“I want to end this fight, too. I’ve already become a villain, but… oh?”\nSe-ah looked down at her hand, noticing it trembling as if it had been strained.\n“Why isn’t my magic replenishing?”\nShe muttered quietly to herself.\nIt felt as if she were scraping the last bits of water from a dried-up well, or driving a car that had run out of fuel.\nHer magic, which had been replenishing slowly, had finally reached its limit. The magic she was expelling now seemed to be the last of it.\n“…No way.”\nFeeling a sense of dread, Se-ah glared at Woo-jin.\nFor some reason, Woo-jin had emerged from the Reversed World to face her. It was a mystery she couldn’t quite grasp.\nBut now, she could guess the answer to that mystery.\n“You did something, didn’t you, senior?”\nSe-ah smirked coldly.\n“That’s why I can’t help but like you, senior….”\nHer voice carried a sigh, a mix of frustration and amusement, as she realized she had fallen into Woo-jin’s trap. Her emotions were conflicted.\nThere was no choice now.\nShe would have to end it with her final magical formula.\nAt that moment, Se-ah sensed a chilling magic from behind her. She quickly turned her head.\nFar off in the distance, Goliath hovered in mid-air, preparing to throw a punch. His fist, wrapped in black magic that distorted space and time, swirled with golden energy.\nFalling debris warped and stretched unnaturally, as if being sucked into his fist.\nThump.\nThump!\nThump!\nThe magic swirling around Goliath’s fist grew larger in stages, gaining mass.\nThe power of a black hole, manifesting in magical form. Although not a true black hole, its destructive force was undeniable.\nThat fist would distort and destroy everything, even space and time.\nSe-ah’s confident smile cracked. She glared at Goliath with her crimson eyes, her face filled with fury.\n“Goliath, are you seriously going that far?! If you unleash a destructive force like that, Neo Seoul… all the people…!”\nThe city would be destroyed, and all the citizens would lose their lives.\n“Shut up…!”\nGoliath laughed boisterously as he shouted.\n“This is the blow that will defeat you…!”\nHis unique ability:\nGraviton Mastery\n. Secret technique:\nMagical Formula Type 5, Event Horizon\n.\nThe pinnacle of destructive power. There was no one in Neo Seoul who could withstand it.\nSe-ah narrowed her eyes.\nWhat she envisioned was the future. The development of Neo Seoul, and the happiness of countless people.\nHer desires and hopes were all genuine.\nTo achieve that, she had used the Principal’s love. She had accepted the sacrifices the Principal made for the future, embracing them for the sake of her utopia.\nIn other words, her \"twisted altruism\" was Se-ah’s fatal flaw.\nHer\nParadox Creation\nability, the secret technique of\nFate Recalibration\n, was also nothing more than a means to suppress the current chaos and bring order by defeating Woo-jin and Goliath.\nGoliath had figured out her intentions and made his move.\nHe knew that she would not be able to fully block his blow and would be destroyed.\n“Ahaha…”\nHer long, dark hair cast a shadow over her face.\nA hollow laugh escaped her lips.\nAnd then.\n“Hahahahahaha!!! Hahahahahaha!!!”\nSe-ah alternated her gaze between Woo-jin and Goliath, pressing her forehead with one hand and laughing maniacally.\n“This is fun…! So much fun…! To think that this might be my final trial…!”\nSe-ah lifted her head.\nDespite her laughter just moments ago, her face had turned cold and expressionless.\nHer sharp gaze fixed on Woo-jin.\n“Come at me.”\nWhooosh!\nSe-ah’s entire body became engulfed in red magic. Soon, her form transformed into that of a massive monster.\nA demonic figure shaped like a female.\n[Let’s settle this once and for all, everyone.]\nHer voice echoed eerily.\nThis was the signal.\n“This is what I’ve been waiting for!!!”\nGoliath’s booming voice echoed across the battlefield.\nAnd then.\nBOOOOOM!\nA deafening explosion and a sonic boom tore through the air.\nGoliath, unleashing a powerful shockwave, flew through the air like a jet toward Se-ah.\nHe drove his fist, infused with the power of\nEvent Horizon\n, straight at her.\nSe-ah’s magical wings glowed with a brilliant light.\nKwoooom!\nThe red magic from the Reversed World clashed with Goliath’s fist.\nThe black hole-like swirling magic attempted to tear apart Se-ah’s red magic, but the sheer power contained in her fist resisted it, resulting in a deadlock.\nThe immense shockwave rippled across the center area, sweeping everything in its path.\nThe students braced themselves, deploying defensive formations, but the collapsing ground and powerful wind forced them to be blown out of the center area.\n“Hahahahaha!!!”\nAmidst the fierce clash, Goliath’s thunderous laughter echoed. Meanwhile, the red ring continued to shrink and fade away.\nAnd then, as the red magic began to be absorbed into Goliath’s\nEvent Horizon\n,\nGoliath shouted at the top of his lungs.\n“This is it, Ahn Woo-jin!!!”\nA massive explosion reverberated.\nA barrage of cracks, filled with the collective power and weapons of the students, converged on Se-ah in a single, focused strike.\nAt the same time, Woo-jin, surrounded by fierce lightning and the flames of the goblin club, charged toward Se-ah.\nSe-ah, having saved some of her strength for Woo-jin, extended her red magic-infused arm toward him, spreading her hand wide.\nThe numerous eyes embedded in the arm flashed, emitting a crimson light aimed at Woo-jin.\nHowever.\nKwooooom!!!\nSuddenly, multiple bolts of spatial lightning filled the air, illuminating the battlefield and converging on Se-ah’s arm from all sides.\nSe-ah, struggling to withstand Goliath’s\nEvent Horizon\n, couldn’t defend against the onslaught of lightning strikes. Her massive red-armored arm was burned and torn away.\nWoo-jin, accompanied by the power of the students, dove straight toward Se-ah.\n“Let’s end this.”\nWith a cold statement, he swung the sword and the goblin club in a powerful horizontal strike.\nKwagagagak!!!!\nThe combined might of Baek-seo’s magic, the goblins’ fire, and the students’ power erupted in a massive explosion, engulfing Se-ah.\nA brilliant flash of light enveloped the world.\nThe magical energy from Woo-jin’s sword and the goblin club consumed Se-ah’s magic, eventually obliterating it.\nThe power of\nEvent Horizon\nalso annihilated itself along with\nParadox Creation\n.\nWoo-jin’s weapon and Goliath’s fist pierced through Se-ah’s massive form, launching her downward.\nBOOOOOM!\nA massive magical explosion swept across the center area.\nThe ominous magic that had grown Se-ah’s form scattered into pieces, and her body was sent flying into the abyss below.\nHer entire body was shattered. The armor she had constructed from the Reversed World’s magic had barely saved her from instant death.\nBut she had no magic left to reshape reality.\nAs Se-ah’s broken body plummeted toward the ground, staring death in the face, she gauged the extent of the explosion’s damage.\nIt seemed to have been contained within the center area.\nAt least, that was a relief, Se-ah thought.\n‘I’ve lost, senior… How foolish. But I guess there’s no helping it now.’\nA self-mocking smile spread across Se-ah’s lips.\n‘It’s time for the villain to exit the stage.’\nSe-ah disappeared beyond the cliff, and the magic from the Reversed World turned to ash, scattering like smoke in the wind.\nThe cracks that Woo-jin had formed in the ground vanished, and the falling debris from the buildings filled the remaining gaps in the earth.\nFinally, Woo-jin and Goliath dispelled their magical techniques, and the ruined center area returned to a peaceful night sky.",

      "content": "The hidden underground escape route beneath the Central Tower.\nPrincipal Lee Doo-hee was desperately clawing at the mechanical wall, her nails torn and bleeding. Despite Chae-yeon’s death, the exit remained firmly sealed.\nThis indicated that it wasn’t simply something created with magic, but an invention of pure ingenuity.\nIt had clearly been prepared beforehand.\nThere had never been a need to inspect this underground escape route.\nFrom the beginning, Chae-yeon had planned to obstruct the principal in secret.\n\"Grrr...! Grrraaa...\"\nThe principal’s face twisted as she scratched at the solid mechanical wall, eventually turning to look toward Chae-yeon.\nBlood-soaked and lifeless.\nThough her head hung low, there was a faint smile of satisfaction on her resentful face.\nAs if to say,\nServes you right.\nThe members of the Do-hwa faction assisting in the escape, along with Lee Jeong-mi, all met their end at Chae-yeon’s hands. It was the result of her risking everything in battle.\nAnd then—\nRumble!\n“Ugh...!”\nThe escape route shook violently, a tremendous roar echoing from above. The principal was thrown to the ground.\nShe realized it must be Woo-jin’s magical formula—\nHeaven’s Reversal\n—unraveling.\nHad Se-ah won?\nNo.\nLee Se-ah’s magic, which had been felt so vividly even here, had vanished like a ghost.\n\"Se-ah’s magic...?\"\nThe principal’s face paled. She slumped to the ground, staring blankly at her injured leg.\n\"My daughter... Se-ah...\"\nSe-ah had lost.\nSe-ah... was dead.\nShe looked down at her own hands.\nEverything she had worked to build...\nHad ended with her daughter’s death.\nCough!\n“Principal... ma’am...”\nAt that moment, Song Ye-seo of Spartoi came to, coughing up blood as she surveyed the surroundings.\n“This... can’t be... is this...?”\nYe-seo pieced the situation together.\n\"...My dear.\"\n\"Principal...?\"\nYe-seo looked at the principal’s face and swallowed nervously.\nIt was an expression of someone who had given up everything.\n“There’s somewhere I must go... And I’ll give you one last order...”\nYe-seo, with great difficulty, stood up and forced a smile.\n“Yes... Whatever order you give...”\nThud.\nGoliath landed on the ground, his clothes tattered.\nCrack.\nWoo-jin returned as well, gracefully warping through space to arrive. His school uniform was also reduced to rags.\n“Hah... Hah...”\nWoo-jin caught his breath, struggling for air.\nDust and debris swirled around them. It was easy to infer that the Central Area had been reduced to ruins.\nCrackle...\nHeaven’s Sword\nhad reached its limit and crumbled to dust.\nIt had absorbed the full force of Baek-seo’s ultimate technique combined with Woo-jin’s maximum magical output. A weapon incapable of handling such immense power had met a spectacular end.\nBaek-seo must have anticipated this outcome.\nWoo-jin decided to think about the broken\nHeaven’s Sword\nlater.\nImmediately after, the goblin club also shattered and burst into flames before disappearing. Now, Woo-jin was left empty-handed.\nNothing remained of the Central Tower’s location. It appeared to have collapsed under the strain of the battle.\nWoo-jin looked around once more, concerned about Goliath’s condition. But the explosion’s aftermath and the dust clouded his vision, making it impossible to see where Goliath was.\nThump.\n\"...!\"\nSuddenly, his heart pounded, and excruciating pain began to spread through his body.\nIt was the penalty of his\nTerritory Domination\nability.\nJust before Woo-jin succumbed to the pain—\nWham.\nA golden-haired girl appeared out of nowhere and threw herself into Woo-jin’s arms.\nIt was Geumyang.\nInstantly, the pain subsided.\nOnly the soreness from his battle with Se-ah remained.\n“You’ve done well.”\n“...You too.”\nAfter absorbing Woo-jin’s penalty, Geumyang gently pulled away from his embrace.\n“Is the task done?”\nGeumyang nodded.\n“What about the King of the Reversed World?”\n“Thanks to you and Goliath defeating Lee Se-ah, the contract-holder has vanished. It seems the principal had bound her to the contract. So, with Se-ah’s death, the contract was nullified. The Reversed World has decided to withdraw, the trapped souls are freed... In other words, they’ve ascended.”\nGeumyang shrugged.\n“That’s it?”\n“No, it’s only natural for there to be anger after losing something they invested so much effort into. But that’s all. The resources the King had been using were destroyed, so now he has to search for something new.”\nGeumyang made a circle with her thumb and forefinger, signaling money.\n“So, at that moment, I offered him something else.”\n“Something else?”\n“A meticulous deity like myself always has something good prepared.”\nGeumyang grinned smugly.\n“What did you offer?”\n“I introduced him to the Goblin King.”\n“The Goblin King?”\n“Yes, it’s from our world. The Goblin World has the energy resources that the Reversed World needs, similar to human souls but consisting of memories and emotions, though they aren’t truly alive.”\nThe penalty imposed on Kim Dal-bi through her contract with the Goblin King.\nIt involved precious memories and the accompanying emotions.\nSuch concepts, gathered from various creatures, could be used as energy resources in the Goblin World.\nAnd the Reversed World could use them as power.\n“Furthermore, the Reversed World amplifies those memories and emotions to generate new strength. That was the source of Lee Se-ah’s power. If provided to the Goblin World, it would create substantial added value. Heh heh...”\nTo Woo-jin, the explanation was incomprehensible.\nHowever, it seemed that the King of the Reversed World and the Goblin King had found a mutually beneficial relationship.\n“So it’s a business deal.”\n“In this world, things aren’t that different. Anyway, I dangled the carrot, and the King took the offer. And with that, the situation was resolved.”\nGeumyang puffed out her chest with pride.\n“It was all thanks to me, warping through space and hopping between worlds as I pleased. Truly, this was my grand achievement!”\nHer eyes sparkled, seeking praise.\n“Yeah... Thanks. You did well. Things worked out thanks to you.”\n“Hmph, yes. Now, keep praising—... No, never mind.”\n“Why?”\nGeumyang’s expression turned uneasy as something crossed her mind. She thought of Han Seo-jin.\n“There’s something I need to tell you. That man, Na-mu... hmm?”\nGeumyang suddenly stopped speaking and looked off into the distance. Woo-jin turned his head in the same direction.\nThrough the slowly settling dust, an elderly woman in a wheelchair appeared. It was Principal Lee Doo-hee.\nThe wheelchair was new, but the principal herself looked like she could collapse and die at any moment.\nBehind her, pushing the wheelchair through the dust and blood, was the barely-conscious, battered Song Ye-seo.\n“Finish it. We’ll talk later.”\n“Mm.”\nGeumyang warped through the cracks and disappeared.\nWoo-jin observed as Principal Lee Doo-hee approached. The wheelchair came to a stop at a respectful distance from him.\n“Principal... I’ve brought you here...”\n“You’ve done well...”\nThud.\nAt last, Ye-seo collapsed to her knees, her strength spent.\n“You... killed my daughter...”\nThe principal bowed her head.\nHer shoulders trembled.\nHer wrinkled face contorted as tears welled in her eyes.\n“My daughter... I’m the one who drove her to this... I killed my own daughter...”\nHer voice was filled with grief.\nThe principal’s hands, resting on the armrest of her wheelchair, trembled violently.\n“Say what you came to say. Stop rambling.”\nWoo-jin’s tone was firm.\nEven the principal’s sorrow over her daughter’s death couldn’t stir any sympathy from Woo-jin.\nHe didn’t care about the principal’s past. The atrocities she had committed were unforgivable.\nAfter a moment, the principal wiped her eyes with her broken hand, composed herself, and looked directly at Woo-jin again.\n“I’ve lost. You’ve won. I was too arrogant, it seems...”\n“...”\n“When The Hole appeared in the Pacific and released the Golden Sheep and numerous monsters... the world became hell. I lost my parents to the monsters... I lost my sister.”\nThe principal’s voice was calm as she continued.\n“This city was built as an academy for the new humanity, prioritizing knowledge and education. But I didn’t believe it was the right choice for humanity. I wanted to take back the world, to reshape this city into something better. Or maybe... I just couldn’t let go of my anger...”\n“And so?”\n“But in the end, I couldn’t change this city. Neither my body nor time was enough to transform it... So I created my daughter using my own DNA. I entrusted her with everything...”\nThe principal lowered her head.\n“I was supposed to pass everything to her... slowly... In the end, I would give my life so that my daughter could succeed in the revolution, becoming the true ruler of Neo Seoul... That’s why I kept myself alive at the bare minimum...”",

      "content": "The principal turned her head towards the collapsed Central Tower.\n\"But human emotions are so insignificant... Over time, as I grew older, my memories faded and my intelligence deteriorated... and eventually, my daughter was all that remained. Desires fade as the years pile up...\"\n\"So, you decided to live for Lee Se-ah? Without even realizing you were being used?\"\n\"I knew I was being used...\"\nThe principal looked back at Woo-jin.\n\"I believed my daughter could accomplish anything. I trusted that she would create something far better than I ever could... So, I gave her power. At the cost of dead children and the dark underbelly of this city, I gave her immense authority.\"\nThe \"dead children\" likely referred to the ones discarded in the process of raising her own personal soldiers.\n\"And even though that meant those children would suffer forever?\"\n\"The sacrifice of the few for the benefit of the many. I accepted that... At first, it was difficult. I vomited every day and was plagued by nightmares. But eventually, I adapted. In time, it became routine, something I accepted without question.\"\nThe principal smiled bitterly, her eyes brimming with tears.\n\"Yes... I became the villain so that my daughter could inherit everything. I wanted her to lead this city the right way!\"\n\"....\"\n\"And now, this is my reward...! You were the price I had to pay...! I was a fool! I was... I was...! Ahh...!\"\nThe principal grabbed her head and rocked back and forth, her wide, bloodshot eyes darting about as her hands tugged at her hair.\nLosing her daughter—who had been everything to her—had shattered her sanity.\n\"I'm sorry... I'm so sorry... My daughter... Ah, my daughter... What was her name...? My daughter’s name... My daughter... My...\"\n\"....\"\n\"My... what was... it again...\"\nPerhaps the painful memories of Se-ah were too much to bear, and the principal’s mind slowly began to erase her.\nAlready suffering from dementia, the rapid deterioration wasn’t surprising.\nAnd then—\nThunk!\n\"....!\"\nSuddenly, a blade shot out from behind the wheelchair, piercing the principal's chest.\nWoo-jin was shocked.\nIt was Ye-seo, who had used her last bit of strength to stab the principal.\nThe principal looked down in disbelief at the blade embedded in her torso.\nYe-seo managed to speak, her voice strained.\n\"Lee Se-ah... your daughter.\"\n\"Ah....\"\n\"Do you remember now?\"\nThe principal's face gradually softened, as if finding peace.\n\"...Thanks to you.\"\nYe-seo smiled faintly.\n\"I've carried out your final order... You asked me to end your life before you forgot your daughter completely... It was an honor to serve you, Principal. I'm only sorry I couldn’t see you realize your dream.\"\nThe principal’s head slowly drooped.\nHer labored breaths grew fainter.\nAt last, she slumped lifelessly in her wheelchair.\nThud.\nYe-seo collapsed to the ground and looked up at Woo-jin.\n\"Disciplinary Director...\"\n\"Why did you follow the principal?\"\n\"Why? Now of all times...?\"\nYe-seo smiled broadly.\n\"I hated this academy city... That's why I thought standing with the one in power was better... It was like walking a tightrope... Heh heh... How worldly of me...\"\nFor the first time, Woo-jin noticed the scars.\nBetween the torn pieces of her nun’s habit and uniform, scars were visible. Scars too old for healing magic to repair.\n\"This city was hell for some people...\"\nWithout her saying it, Woo-jin understood why Ye-seo always wore a nun’s habit that covered her entire body.\n\"That’s all I can offer you...\"\n\"....\"\n\"Now, I’ll return to my Lord’s side... I pray that your path is filled with peace and happiness, Director.\"\nWith the blood-stained knife that had pierced the principal, Ye-seo stabbed her own heart and died instantly.\nShe had already been close to death; the fact that she’d held on this long was a testament to her willpower.\nNow that she had finished her last task, she allowed herself to fall into the eternal sleep she had resisted for so long.\n\"...Pathetic, even to the end.\"\nWoo-jin muttered softly as he looked at the two bodies. He turned away from the principal and Ye-seo, walking through the ruins of the devastated street.\nThey were left behind, in the ruins.\n\"?\"\nAt that moment, Goliath appeared in Woo-jin's sight. He stopped walking and looked at him.\nGoliath’s clothes were in tatters, and his right arm—the one that had clashed with Se-ah’s power—was completely ruined.\n‘Wait, his body...?’\nIt wasn’t just damaged; red energy was pulsing through his skin, even seeping into his neck.\nIt was the energy of the Reversed World.\n\"You...\"\nWoo-jin's eyes widened.\nHe recalled Se-ah’s words.\nThat taking a direct hit from her technique would bring death closer.\nThe power had left its mark on Goliath, much like radiation poisoning from a distant nuclear explosion. It seemed the aftermath of the battle had successfully infiltrated his body.\nYet Goliath grinned, baring his large teeth, completely unfazed, as he walked forward.\nAs if he had expected this outcome.\nRumble!\nSuddenly, a fierce wind of energy erupted from Goliath’s body.\nIt was clear battle intent.\nWoo-jin narrowed his eyes.\nThough they had fought the same enemy just moments ago, Woo-jin knew what kind of man Goliath was.\nGoliath had only one thrill left—Woo-jin.\nBoom!\nAs Goliath planted his foot, the ground beneath him cracked.\nWhip!\nWoo-jin pulled his iron rod from his belt, extending it with a swift motion.\nCrackle!\nElectric blue lightning surged along the iron rod.\nThud!!\nGoliath launched himself at Woo-jin, his fist cloaked in a gravitational wave.\nWoo-jin met the path of Goliath’s fist with a spatial rift, swinging his iron rod at the same time.\n\"!\"\nGoliath’s fist broke through the rift, but Woo-jin’s iron rod struck him square in the torso.\nCrackle!!\nBoom!!\nThe shockwave of electricity sent Goliath flying. Yet, as he landed, he casually crossed his arms, standing tall.\nRumble!\nDespite the powerful impact, Goliath’s body skidded along the ground, but he used his gravitational control to stop himself from being knocked over.\nEventually, he came to a stop.\nWoo-jin remained on guard, while Goliath, still smiling, stared back at him.\nCrack.\n\"You two!! What do you think you're doing!?\"\nA crack appeared in the air, and from it, Geumyang emerged, shouting.\n\"Heh heh... Isn’t it obvious?\"\n\"Of course it’s obvious! And look at your body—!\"\nGoliath ignored Geumyang’s warning and laughed, taking a fighting stance.\n\"All that’s left is you, Ahn Woo-jin. Do you know how long I’ve waited for you to get stronger? Now it’s time to entertain me...!\"\n\"We were temporary allies. Isn’t it polite to at least build up to this properly?\"\n\"Hahahaha! I don’t care about that!\"\nGoliath’s golden eyes flashed.\n\"I figured you were ‘the right one,’ better than that boring trash like the principal! That means this ends with me!\"\nWoo-jin’s eyes widened slightly.\nOnly now did he understand Goliath’s intent.\n\"You little brats, what kind of—\"\n\"Geumyang, go.\"\n\"What?\"\nWoo-jin threw off his jacket and rolled up his sleeves, revealing his muscular arms.\nHe approached Goliath.\n\"I also thought this journey would end with you. Finally, we’ve reached this point...\"\nWoo-jin’s cold eyes burned with fighting spirit.\nHe recalled their conversations and his knowledge of the original story.\nWhat was Goliath’s real purpose?\nHe had been watching to see what true justice for Neo Seoul looked like.\nAnd he had decided to stand against the side he thought represented it, making himself the villain.\nThus, Goliath became the most notorious villain in the city.\nHe had terrorized Neo Seoul, primarily causing property damage and taking down the city's strongest figures.\nBut he had never actually killed anyone.\nGoliath had chosen to play the villain.\nIn his mind, if justice couldn’t defeat him, it wasn’t worth being called justice. He had planned to cultivate his own version of a new world.\nAnd in that world, he had been waiting for a true hero to rise up and defeat him.\n—\n“What I want is a hero. A hero for this city...”\nWoo-jin remembered Goliath’s words.\nThat was it.\nGoliath had been waiting for a hero to defeat him.\n\"It wasn’t you who waited for me.\"\nGoliath tore off the remains of his tattered shirt, laughing boldly.\n\"I’ve been waiting for you!\"\nGoliath had chosen Woo-jin.\nNow he intended to fight Woo-jin to confirm if he was the hero he had been waiting for.\nLooking at Goliath’s body, consumed by Se-ah’s magic, it was clear he didn’t have much time left.\nGoliath was burning through the last of his life.\nWoo-jin accepted his sincerity.\nWhip!\nWoo-jin drew another rod from his belt and swung it. As it extended into a three-section staff, the\nWall Breaker\nrevealed itself.\nWoo-jin’s turquoise eyes locked with Goliath’s golden ones.\n\"I’ll enforce justice and punish the criminal.\"\nCrackle!\nThe blue lightning surged from both the iron rod and the three-section staff in Woo-jin’s hands. He took his stance.\n\"...Let’s finish this.\"\nThe final showdown between the strongest in Neo Seoul, the culmination of Woo-jin’s journey as the Disciplinary Director.\nGoliath.\nThis was the end of the line.",

      "content": "What is freedom?\nIt is the fluttering of a bird's wings as it soars through the vast sky.\nIt is the steady journey of a sturdy ship navigating the boundless sea.\nFreedom means there is no place you cannot go, nowhere you cannot set foot.\nThat was the kind of freedom Goliath pursued.\nBut what was Neo Seoul to Goliath?\nEven though it was his homeland, it was merely a small pasture compared to the vast world, a place where humans fought to survive within its narrow confines.\nYet, humans are creatures of conflict, are they not? Even within that small pasture, they never ceased fighting, using schemes and trickery to secure their positions.\nIndeed.\nThat is the nature of humans.\nGoliath felt alive when he fought against the strong. He roamed outside the city, engaging in fierce battles with monsters.\nHe relished the vast world to his heart's content.\nBut what had all those countless battles given Goliath?\nHow had they changed him?\nWhat desires had they stirred within him?\nThe answer lay here, now.\nBoom!\nAs Goliath launched himself off the ground, a sonic boom echoed around him. His body shot forward like a cannonball, his fist clenched, aimed directly at Woo-jin.\nRoar!\nThe gravitational waves gathered around his fist, turning it into a blow that would not merely destroy but warp Woo-jin’s entire body upon impact.\nThe fist of Neo Seoul’s strongest.\nHis unique ability,\nGraviton Mastery\n.\nThe second technique,\nUltimate Fist\n.\nWoo-jin didn’t charge in recklessly.\nCrack.\nA rift appeared in the air as space itself split open. Woo-jin leaped into the rift, looking for an opening to strike.\n“I won’t let you escape!”\nGoliath followed, diving into the rift after Woo-jin.\nInside the wormhole.\nGoliath quickly caught up to Woo-jin.\nStartled, Woo-jin instinctively raised his iron rod and three-section staff, crossing them defensively. His body moved purely out of reflex.\nGoliath’s massive, bandaged fist unleashed a gravitational wave as it targeted Woo-jin.\nWoo-jin’s electrified iron rod and staff met Goliath’s fist head-on, creating a shockwave that reverberated throughout the wormhole.\nBoom!\nThe massive amount of magical energy that flowed through the wormhole shook violently as the dense forces collided, creating a powerful impact.\nBoth Woo-jin and Goliath were thrown back.\nThey flew through opposite ends of the wormhole, tumbling back into the real world as they skidded across the ground.\nCrash!!\nEven as he flew through the air, Goliath regained his footing and stabilized himself.\nBoth men bore the blessing of the\nGolden Sheep\n.\nA surprise attack, using spatial manipulation to avoid Goliath’s strikes, wouldn’t work against him.\nCrack!\nIn an instant, Woo-jin reappeared before Goliath, using spatial warping to close the distance.\nSimultaneously, the air was filled with countless cracks.\nRumble!\nFrom these cracks, bolts of lightning erupted, raining down upon Goliath.\nThe powerful lightning surged like a serpent, chasing Goliath as Woo-jin charged in with his iron rod.\nThen—\nBoom!!\n“!”\nThe ground suddenly shattered beneath their feet, rising into the air. Woo-jin was thrown into the sky along with the debris.\nWhoosh!\nThe building rubble and Woo-jin’s body quickly ascended.\n\"Gravity... reversed!\"\nWoo-jin kicked off a piece of floating debris and positioned himself beneath another. Now, he was hanging upside down, like a bat.\nIt was Goliath’s third technique,\nGravity Reversal\n.\nGoliath had also risen into the air, dodging the lightning attack by using the floating debris.\nHe kicked off a chunk of building, rocketing towards Woo-jin once more.\nRoar!\nAgain, Goliath’s fist was enveloped in a powerful gravitational wave.\nCrackle!\nWoo-jin activated his three-section staff. Blue-green lightning crackled from the staff like chains, electrifying the air around him.\nThe wave of lightning followed Woo-jin as he swung his staff toward Goliath.\nBoom!!\nThe thunderous explosion echoed as the massive electric storm enveloped Goliath.\nBut Goliath’s gravitational wave punched through the storm and continued its trajectory toward Woo-jin.\nWoo-jin was caught in the shockwave and flung backward at tremendous speed, flying through the air like an arrow or a comet.\nHe streaked across the sky before crashing into a large rock.\nBoom!\n“Cough...!”\nWoo-jin coughed up blood.\nThe rock crumbled as dust rose into the air, the acrid smell stinging his nose.\nHe looked around.\nThe dust quickly settled, revealing a strange sight.\nA sky transformed into a swirl of strange colors due to the corrupted magic of monsters.\nTrees drained of their green hues.\nThe ground marred with massive footprints.\nThis surreal landscape...\n“Did I get thrown outside...?”\nThe world beyond the land blessed by the\nGolden Sheep\n.\nA desolate wasteland, where the monsters’ magical corruption and radiation had rendered it uninhabitable for most humans.\nThis was the outside world.\nAt his current rank of seven, Woo-jin could withstand the air of the outside world thanks to his enhanced physical abilities.\n‘This might actually be for the best.’\nWoo-jin rose to his feet, gripping his iron rod and three-section staff.\nA battle with Goliath would have caused severe damage to Neo Seoul. It was better to fight here.\nWhoosh!\nBoom!\nGoliath crashed down in front of Woo-jin like a meteor, kicking up a cloud of dust. From within that dust, Goliath’s confident smile appeared, meeting Woo-jin’s gaze.\n“First time in the outside world?”\n“Yeah... thanks for the sightseeing.”\n“No need for thanks...!”\nGoliath grinned.\nIt was a joke, and Woo-jin caught onto it.\n‘He’s been hurt.’\nWoo-jin noticed that Goliath’s left fist trembled slightly. He had managed to land a significant blow.\nGoliath’s right arm was unusable.\nIf Woo-jin could somehow disable his left arm, his chances of victory would increase.\nWoo-jin smirked to himself.\nIf Goliath had been in perfect condition, how could he have possibly hoped to win?\nUnlike the original story, the\nGreat Eater’s\nultimate technique had targeted Woo-jin instead of Goliath.\nHad he not fought Se-ah, Goliath would have been invincible.\nBut Woo-jin dismissed those thoughts.\nThe sight of a man burning through his final moments stirred something inside him.\nHe felt a strange connection to Goliath’s sense of joy.\nHe extended his three-section staff once again and took a battle stance.\n“Stop stalling. Come at me.”\n“Hahaha!! Of course...!”\nBoom!\nWoo-jin and Goliath charged at each other once again.\nCrash!!\nTheir fierce battle shook the battlefield as they clashed.\nWoo-jin’s fourth magical technique,\nHeaven’s Reversal\n, inverted the sky and earth, while lightning and rain poured down like a storm.\nGoliath’s third technique,\nGravity Reversal\n, turned gravity in various directions, creating chaos across the battlefield.\nThey attacked and defended with all their strength, and as the battle continued, the entire landscape became unrecognizable.\nRumble!\nA bolt of lightning struck down.\nWoo-jin’s iron rod pierced through Goliath’s body, sending a surge of high-voltage electricity through him. The shockwave crushed Goliath’s internal organs, but he still grinned as his body flew through the debris, crashing into the ground.\nWham!\nGoliath’s fist slammed into Woo-jin’s abdomen, sending him flying once again.\nThe gravitational wave distorted Woo-jin’s insides, causing him to cough up blood as he shot through the air at breakneck speed.\nClenching his teeth, Woo-jin kicked off the floating debris, using spatial warping to propel himself back toward Goliath.\nRumble!\nAnother wave of spatial lightning crashed down on Goliath.\nBoulders and debris, controlled by Goliath’s gravitational powers, flew towards Woo-jin in return.\nWhoosh!\nA massive crack opened in the sky, releasing molten lava onto Goliath. The scorching lava poured over his body.\n“Hahaha...! Feels like a hot spring!”\nBut Goliath remained unscathed, as though he had merely taken a shower.\nWoo-jin chuckled to himself. This was exactly what he expected.\nThat’s what made Goliath worthy of being Neo Seoul’s strongest.\nRumble!\nThe crack in the sky grew even wider.\nThere had been limits to the range in the Central Area, but here, Woo-jin unleashed his full power.\nThe massive crack filled the sky, blocking out the heavens, and even from distant Neo Seoul, its overwhelming presence could be felt.\nFar away, the citizens of the city watched in awe, holding their breath as they witnessed the clash of magical forces.\nBoom!\nThe debris that had been falling from the sky was halted mid-air by Goliath’s\nGravity Manipulation\n.\nWoo-jin and Goliath stood on separate chunks of floating debris, staring each other down.\n“Hah... hah...”\nWoo-jin caught his breath, locking eyes with Goliath. Se-ah’s magic had left deep scars across Goliath’s body, and they had spread even further, consuming him.\nGoliath’s body was weakened—he was at the brink of death. In fact, it was a wonder he was still standing at all.\nYet, Goliath’s grin remained, unwavering.\n“You think you can take me down like this?” Goliath shouted, spreading his broken right arm and shaking left arm wide.\n“I’m right here! Come at me!”\n“…Fine.”\nWoo-jin slowly raised his right arm. His heart pounded in his chest as he pushed himself beyond his limits, summoning the full power of his\nSpatial Domination\nability.\nHis magic surged violently, threatening to tear him apart from within. It was as if his body was on fire, the sensation of his own energy burning him alive.\nBut Woo-jin didn’t fight it. He let himself be consumed by the energy, closing his eyes and embracing the overwhelming power.\nHe had already reached the threshold.\nHe hadn’t even realized it, but he had been knocking on the door of the eighth rank all along.\nAll that was left was to break through.\n“I’m coming.”\nAs if waiting for this moment, Woo-jin’s body finally accepted the surge of energy. The power that had been raging inside him suddenly calmed and stabilized.\nThe magic now enveloped him like a warm breeze, soothing the burning sensation.\nWoo-jin’s skin began to glow faintly, a soft, radiant light emanating from his body. His presence seemed to grow stronger by the second.\nSlowly, he opened his eyes.\nHis irises shimmered with a blend of deep blue and violet, the colors of his unique ability shining with an otherworldly glow.\nGoliath’s eyes widened in awe. The magic radiating from Woo-jin had become even more potent in just a brief moment.\n\"Heh… hahaha!!\" Goliath burst into laughter, his voice filled with wild joy.\n“You’ve done it! You’ve reached the eighth rank! You’re making this so damn fun, Ahn Woo-jin!!!”\nThe eighth rank.\nThe realm of the\nArgonaut\n, a level Goliath had reached long ago.\nNow, Woo-jin had finally caught up.",

      "content": "The purest energy flowed through Ahn Woo-jin's body. His abilities had already surpassed the current level, allowing him to wield power far beyond others at the same tier.\n\"Haaa!\"\nInfinite energy surged through his right arm, extending outward into the sky and beyond.\nCrack!!\nA tear in the sky expanded all the way to space. Layers upon layers of similar-sized cracks spread across the heavens.\nAnd then—\nRoarrrrr!\n\"…!\"\nA terrifying shockwave reverberated from beyond the tear in the sky, and Goliath looked up in shock.\n—\"Ahn Woo-jin, did you know that the first murder committed by humankind was done with a stone?\"\nSuddenly, Goliath remembered the conversation he once had with Woo-jin.\nA stone.\nThe very first murder weapon of humanity.\nAnd according to the Bible, wasn’t it a stone that David used to bring down Goliath?\nGoliath's heart raced, exhilarated by the sheer thrill of the moment.\nRumble!\nFinally, the entity descending through the tear revealed itself. Its size was so massive it couldn't be fully captured by sight.\nA gigantic boulder, enveloped in fire and green lightning, saturated with all of Woo-jin's power, was plummeting toward them.\nIt was a meteor.\nIt descended through the layers of tears in the sky, growing stronger and faster, radiating unstoppable force and awe across the world.\nUnique ability: Spatial Domination. Ultimate technique. Magic Formula #5, \"Heavenly Thunder Meteor Strike.\"\nThe meteor's brilliance illuminated the darkened world. Goliath, mouth agape in astonishment, finally burst into laughter.\n\"With that attack, at least half the Earth will be destroyed!\"\n\"Then stop it if you can,\" Woo-jin replied coldly.\n\"Hahahaha! You're making this fun!\"\nGoliath clenched his fists, releasing all his remaining power.\nWhooosh!\nIn his left fist, he concentrated the power of a black hole.\nUnique ability: Graviton Mastery. Ultimate technique. Magic Formula #5, \"Event Horizon.\"\nAlthough his strength had weakened from his previous battle with Se-ah, it didn’t matter.\nHe was going to pour everything into this final strike.\nTaking his stance—\n‘When was it?’\nAs the Heavenly Thunder Meteor Strike filled his vision, Goliath's mind wandered back to the first time he looked out at Neo Seoul from beyond the walls.\nHe realized then how small his world had been.\nThe laws and morals humanity constructed within the boundaries of society were there just to keep that tiny world in balance.\nIt was simple, really.\nThe world was vast, and a single stone could kill a man.\nThat was the futile truth of life.\nYet, because of that, wasn’t the sight of humanity striving to create meaning in such a small, ordered world beautiful?\n‘Beloved world.’\nGoliath cherished the home that humanity had built.\nHe wanted Neo Seoul to become a better place.\nBut the definition of \"right\" varied from person to person, and without knowing the future, there was no way to tell what consequences each person's \"rightness\" would bring.\nSo Goliath watched, unsure if anyone's justice would bring the change the world needed. All he could do was witness the fate of his beloved city.\nBut one thing was clear.\nAnyone who could overcome the adversity that Goliath represented, armed only with strength, could be trusted with everything.\nSo, beloved world—\n‘Prepare to meet your hero!’\nWith that thought, Goliath hurled himself toward the meteor, roaring like a beast as he swung his fist.\nFor a moment, there was silence as the world seemed to freeze.\nAnd then—\nBoom!\nThe meteor shattered upon impact, absorbed into Goliath's fist. But it was so large that shards of it branched off, transforming into smaller meteors that rained down upon the outer world.\nThe staggering collision of their powers unleashed a destructive shockwave, sweeping across the land and turning everything to ruin.\nCountless beasts in the distance met an unexpected death.\nThe floating ground was blown apart, and the shockwave reached as far as Neo Seoul, shattering the barren outskirts into pieces.\nWoo-jin and Goliath’s powers, having exhausted themselves, slowly began to fade.\nThey were both caught in the shockwave and lost consciousness, crashing into the deep crater that had formed around them.\nExplosions continued to echo across the world.\nMany things were destroyed, and the air was filled with the noise of devastation.\nAnd then… time passed.\n...Drop.\nIn the mysterious sky of the outer world, a newfound silence began to fill the air.\n“Ugh… cough! Haah…”\nWoo-jin regained consciousness, groaning in pain.\nHis ears rang, but he had no time to dwell on it.\nHis hands were empty. He had no idea where his Iron Dragon Staff and his Tri-Segmented Staff had gone.\nHis priority was to stand up.\nWith a body at the brink of collapse, Woo-jin braced himself against the ground and managed to stagger to his feet.\n“Haah… haah…”\nThe penalty?\nHe could still feel the effects lingering in his body. It seemed the penalty had passed while he was unconscious.\nExhausted, Woo-jin turned his gaze to where he sensed movement.\nThere was Goliath.\nEven after losing consciousness, he still stood tall.\nHis body was covered in deadly wounds, and Se-ah’s magic had claimed half of his form.\n“Hmph…”\nGoliath’s eyes regained their light.\nHe had awakened.\nWith heavy steps, he freed his foot from the ground and began walking toward Woo-jin.\nA menacing figure.\nGrinning widely with his large, sharp teeth exposed, Goliath appeared like an indestructible gladiator.\nWoo-jin couldn't help but smile silently.\nThe man was infuriatingly resilient.\nHis muscles, bones, and organs screamed in pain. Every part of him wanted to collapse right then and there.\nBut more than anything, the overwhelming desire to bring down the man before him burned brighter than all the pain.\nIf Goliath was going to burn through his final moments, then Woo-jin would, too.\nHe stood tall.\nHis tattered school uniform clung to him. Tearing off the bothersome half-sleeves revealed his muscular arms. He clenched his fists, assuming the stance of a boxer preparing for one last fight in the ring.\nHe was ready to see Goliath’s end.\nGoliath took one look at Woo-jin’s stance, his eyes widening before he let out a chuckle, clenching his own fist.\nHis right arm was completely destroyed, twitching like a malfunctioning robotic limb.\nHis right leg, too, had given up after the last few steps.\nGoliath knew half his body had already been ruined by Se-ah's magic.\nBut his left arm still moved. His left leg still worked.\nHe could still fight.\nAnd that made him happy.\nBoth fighters had run out of power.\nThey couldn’t even reinforce their bodies anymore, but that didn’t matter. Just reaching the 8th tier had placed them within the realm of the strongest.\nWithout a word, Woo-jin dashed forward.\nGoliath, leaving his dead right leg behind, pushed off the ground with his left and lunged.\nBam!\nWoo-jin’s fist connected with Goliath’s torso, and Goliath’s fist crashed into Woo-jin’s body. Both men grunted in pain but smiled through it.\nPunch.\nThey hit each other in the face.\nPunch.\nThey blocked each other’s attacks, barely keeping up.\nKick!\nWoo-jin landed a powerful kick to Goliath’s side.\nIt was a simple, straightforward fight.\nWoo-jin’s mind could no longer function rationally. All he could do was throw his fists to end it.\nBut Goliath, whose life had already reached its limit, slowly lost strength and began to falter under Woo-jin’s relentless blows.\nFinally, as Woo-jin raised his fist for one last strike—\nThud.\nGoliath’s body gave out, and he collapsed, his energy drained completely.\nShallow breaths escaped Goliath's lips. Ragged gasps filled the air.\nFinally, it was over, and Woo-jin’s body relaxed, forcing him to collapse to the ground.\nThud.\n“Pant, pant…”\nWoo-jin sat there, breathing heavily, staring at Goliath.\nThe battered man lay on his back, staring up at the sky.\nThe polluted skies of the outer world, tainted by the magic of the beasts, were strange and beautiful. Seeing it fill his vision, Goliath couldn’t help but let out a small laugh.\nAnd then—\n“…I’ve won.”\nWoo-jin’s calm voice broke the silence.\n“Hahaha… hahahahaha!!”\nGoliath’s laughter boomed.\n“Yes, I’ve lost…! Thanks to you, I fought to the very end…! I am grateful…!”\nCovered in wounds, Goliath’s body was filled with the remnants of Se-ah’s magic, healing his injuries as his life force slowly faded away.\nHe could feel his life slipping away.\nBut his voice was stronger than ever.\n“I accomplished everything I wanted…! I fought with those who wielded power, and I gave it my all…! What a romantic life I lived! I have no regrets at all…!”\nGoliath’s golden eyes turned milky white, like someone who had gone blind. He could no longer see the beautiful sky.\nWith his last bit of strength, Goliath smiled wide and shouted his final words.\n“What a joyous life it was…!”\nGoliath’s voice echoed into the distance.\nAnd then, silence.\nThe remnants of Se-ah’s magic, which had kept\nGoliath’s voice echoed into the distance.\nAnd then, silence.\nThe remnants of Se-ah’s magic, which had filled Goliath’s body, faded away, completing their task.\nGoliath’s once vibrant form, now lifeless, lay motionless. His face, frozen in a wide grin, showed no trace of regret or sorrow.\n“…Farewell.”\nWoo-jin quietly bid Goliath his final goodbye, watching as the colossal man—who had fought to the very end—took his last breath.",

      "content": "\"The defendant, Ahn Woo-jin, is acquitted.\"\nIn the Trial Academy, the AI judge rendered its verdict.\nThe spectators who had filled the courtroom rushed out to the front gates, where the representative student unfurled a large banner.\nOn the banner were the words:\n[ NOT GUILTY ]\n“Wooaaaahhhh!!!” “He’s innocent!!! Not guilty!!!”\nThe streets outside the school gates were packed with people who had been hoping for Ahn Woo-jin’s acquittal, and they erupted in cheers.\n─ ... In other news, a case of monumental importance that will go down in history has reached its conclusion. Ahn Woo-jin, the Disciplinary Committee President of Aseong High School, led a rebellion against the late Headmaster Lee Doo-hee, which escalated into the major conflict involving Spartoi and the Hanyang Federal Academy, now known as the ‘Academy Great War.’ As the complex details of the incident came to light, the public was shocked, eagerly awaiting the verdict for those involved. Eventually, taking into account the unavoidable circumstances and the public interest, Ahn Woo-jin was acquitted...\nIt had been a month and a half since Ahn Woo-jin destroyed a part of Academy City.\nAs the truth of the incident unfolded, Neo Seoul erupted in outrage, and Woo-jin, along with the others who had rebelled against the Headmaster and the Martial Law Guards, was acquitted of all charges.\nGiven the highly unusual nature of the case, the fact that all eyes were on it, and the clarity of the evidence, the Trial Academy, aware of public sentiment, delivered a swift verdict.\nThe speed of the trial, enabled by the AI judge, was more procedural than anything else.\nThe facts were clear, and the entire population of Neo Seoul had risen in support of Woo-jin.\nThough there was some criticism of Woo-jin for the destruction he had caused, most citizens argued that much of the damage had targeted the defense mechanisms set up by the late Headmaster, thus mitigating the legal severity of his actions.\nNaturally, the student prosecutor did not appeal the ruling, and the case reached its final conclusion.\n─ This is Park Dae-gi from Cheong-un High School. I’m currently at the Center Area, where cleanup efforts are underway. The remnants of the late Headmaster Lee Doo-hee’s regime are being removed, and plans are in place to reconstruct the area to make it safer...\n─ Citizens’ anger toward the late Headmaster Lee Doo-hee escalated after the discovery of numerous children's bodies in the underground lair of techno-mancer Moon Chae-yeon, one of the Six Criminals. To honor the children who were unjustly sacrificed, a memorial is being established...\n─ The factory-born children’s socialization programs, which have long been criticized for human rights violations, were continually defended by the late Headmaster Lee. These programs are now being dismantled, and more humane methods are being implemented for socialization processes...\n─ In other news, an unprecedented suspended sentence has been granted to Kim Dal-bi, the Goblin, one of the Six Criminals. It was proven that she was forced into committing acts of terrorism due to the Headmaster’s threats, and despite this, she managed to avoid any loss of life. As a result, her resistance was recognized as the most humane possible. Her school, Aseong High, has decided not to expel her but to impose special educational requirements and community service...\nThe aftermath of the Academy Great War continued to dominate the news.\nIn response to the public’s demands, special agencies were established to monitor the Federal Council and the Hanyang Federal Academy's Student Council, weakening the absolute power of the Federal Council.\nThe fact that the Federal Council had hidden during the conflict out of fear of Woo-jin led to public backlash, further eroding their authority.\nThe position of Headmaster remained vacant, with a member of the Federal Council temporarily assuming the responsibilities. Elections for a new Headmaster were expected to be held soon.\n“W-what?! Hanyang sent me a love call?!”\nAt Mahyeon High’s Disciplinary Committee, Chairman Lee Je-ho trembled as he read the official letter delivered by Vice-Chairman Shin Ga-yeon.\n“Hrm, hrm!” Je-ho cleared his throat awkwardly.\nThe Student Council President had positively evaluated Je-ho's role in the Academy Great War and was trying to recruit him.\nIt was an opportunity to become a super-elite.\n“You must be thrilled, Chairman. If you can join Hanyang, you’ll be more than a super-elite—a hyper-elite.”\n“….”\nJe-ho glanced at Ga-yeon. Her expression was calm, almost unnervingly so.\n“Um, Vice-Chairman….”\n“If you refuse because of me, I won’t let it go.”\n“You won’t let it go? How?”\n“I’ll get angry.”\nJe-ho swallowed dryly, then adjusted his glasses with a cough.\n“Hah….”\nJe-ho leaned back in his chair.\nThen, he tore the recruitment letter in half.\nGa-yeon gasped in shock.\n“Chairman…!” “Do you think I’d go there? I don’t care about being a super-elite or a hyper-elite.” “…You’ve always talked about becoming an elite. Are you really not going because of me? I told you I’d be upset.” “It’s not because of you. It’s because the President is still here...!” “Siscon!”\nSmack!\n“Ugh!”\nGa-yeon punched Je-ho in the face.\n“At least pretend it’s because of me! Do you know how much you’re hurting your girlfriend’s pride?!”\nSmack! Smack!\n“Y-you said you’d only get mad! What do you expect me to do?!” “You don’t understand a woman’s heart!”\nAs Ga-yeon hit him repeatedly, Je-ho couldn’t help but laugh. Ga-yeon was just too cute.\n“Haha…!”\nSeeing his smile, Ga-yeon shivered.\n“Chairman, don’t tell me you’ve developed some kind of M tendencies…?” “No, absolutely not….”\nJe-ho frowned, adamantly denying it.\nMahyeon High’s Disciplinary Committee had earned a massive mileage reward for their role in the Academy Great War, and Je-ho’s reputation continued to rise.\nIn another part of the city...\nKim Dal-bi leaned against her locker, staring intently at her smartphone, deep in thought.\nPassing students glanced at her nervously.\n“It’s the Goblin.” “What’s she up to?” “Looks suspicious….” “She’s scary. Is she plotting something?”\nThe students whispered quietly, but Dal-bi didn’t notice, too absorbed in her phone to care.\nNow known to the world as one of the Six Criminals, Dal-bi had returned to Aseong High under her real identity, Kim Dal-bi.\nHer true self, with long, flowing pink hair, was no longer in hiding.\nNaturally, most students were still wary of her.\nBut that wasn’t Dal-bi’s biggest concern right now.\n[ Hey, the weather’s nice today ]\nShe wrote a message on CoconutTalk, then deleted it.\n“No, too casual. I need to be more direct…”\n[ Want to grab lunch with me today? ]\nDeleted.\n“That’s too sudden...”\n[ Hey Woo-jin, it’s me, Kim Dal-bi. Wanna— ]\n[ The weather makes me crave bibimbap, how about— ]\n[ What do you like for lunch, by the way? ]\n[ Wanna grab some bibimbap with me? ]\n[ Ahn Woo-jin! Come out! Let’s have lunch together! ]\nAnd so, she kept typing and deleting messages over and over.\n“Ugh…”\nDal-bi groaned, resting her forehead against her locker. Passersby flinched at the sight.\nHer phone screen still showed her latest message draft.\nThe recipient? Ahn Woo-jin.\nDal-bi just wanted to have lunch with him.\nBut…\n‘What should I write to make it sound natural?!’\nShe had been debating the message for over 20 minutes.\n‘This is so frustrating! We’re still a little awkward with each other….’\nDal-bi sighed deeply and stared at her phone again.\n“…Huh?”\nHer face went pale as she realized what had happened.\n[ Kim Dal-bi: Ahn Woo-jin! Come out! Let’s have lunch together ]\nThe message had been sent by mistake.\nThud!\nDal-bi collapsed to the ground, clutching her head in despair.\n‘Nooooo!’\nDal-bi was mentally screaming in anguish.\nStudents watched from a distance, fascinated by the rollercoaster of expressions on her face.\n‘What do I do? What do I do?! Can I delete it…?!’\nShe frantically searched for a way to retract the message.\nBut just as she was about to try, the ‘1’ indicator next to the message disappeared.\nWoo-jin had read it.\n‘He read it….’\nDal-bi’s world crumbled around her.\nHer face flushed, her eyes spun in circles, and she grabbed at her hair.\n‘He’s going to think I’m weird! No, he already thinks that! Why did I send something so embarrassing?! Ugh, I screwed up so bad!’\nAnd just as she was about to wallow in despair—\nBuzz.\nHer phone vibrated, and Dal-bi looked at the screen.\n[ Ahn Woo-jin: What do you want to eat? ] [ Ahn Woo-jin: Oh ] [ Ahn Woo-jin: I’ve got a list of places I wanted to try ] [ Ahn Woo-jin: Wanna check them out? ] [ Ahn Woo-jin: There are a lot of spots I wanted to take you to ] [ Ahn Woo-jin: (scratching-head dog emoji) ]\n“Wow…!”\nSparkling, teary-eyed, Dal-bi’s face broke into a radiant smile.\nSix whole replies, one of them even with a cute emoji!\nTo Dal-bi, this was a dream come true!\n“Hehehe~.”\nShe hugged her phone to her chest, beaming with joy.\nThe students passing by found her happiness… unsettling.\n“What’s gotten into her…?” “She looks… kind of crazy.” “Well, she’s one of the Six Criminals, after all. Something’s gotta be off.” “Still, she’s really pretty.” “Yeah, super pretty…”\nBut none of their whispers reached Dal-bi’s ears.",

      "content": "The backlog of work was overwhelming.\nVice-Head of the Aseong High School Disciplinary Committee, Oh Baek-seo, was unusually focused as she busily handled her administrative tasks. Haye-song, Park Min-hyuk, and Yoo Do-ha were no exception to the chaos.\n“Ughhh…”\nHaye-song trembled, her body visibly shaking.\nFinally—\n“Aaaah!!”\nShe exploded.\nEveryone, except for Baek-seo, turned their attention to Haye-song.\n“There’s too much work!! Ahhh!! Freedom, come to me!!”\nShe dashed to the window, threw it open, and screamed at the top of her lungs.\nUnder-eye bags darkening his face, Min-hyuk gave her a pitying look.\n“Sit down. We’ve got to work… We’ve been busy with so much stuff, we can’t help it.”\n“Park Min-hyuk!! Don’t you think something’s wrong with this?! I’ve been busy enough as it is! And exams are coming up soon! I want to watch my dramas! I want to play games!”\n“Haaa…”\nMin-hyuk sighed.\n“Just deal with it. The Head isn’t here, so what can we do?”\nDo-ha chimed in, casting a glance at Haye-song.\n“Seriously, the Head has a meeting with Hanyang at a time like this? It’s like they planned it!”\n“They went with the Student Council President for important matters. The Head’s position has become significant, after all. With his space powers growing stronger, he’s now the only one who can travel to the other cities blessed by the Golden Sheep. He’s practically vital to the human revival project now. And besides, it’s a meeting with the Student Council President! Only you would think he’s running away.”\n“Can’t you just sympathize, Min-hyuk…”\nGrumbling, Haye-song dragged herself back to her seat, stretching her words as she continued her work.\n“Hey, Baek-seo.”\n“Hmm?”\nBaek-seo answered without turning her head.\n“We got our mileage rewards, right? Did you commission a weapon again?”\n“Yep. I requested the same thing as last time—Hyunun Blade.”\n“I see, I see. But Baek-seo, I wonder who you went with this time? Hmm?”\nHaye-song asked slyly, grinning in a teasing manner.\nOver the weekend, while using her mileage rewards from the Academy Great War, Haye-song had gone to New Yongsan Street.\nAnd there, she’d spotted Baek-seo.\nWith Woo-jin.\nSmelling a juicy secret, Haye-song had snapped a photo, ready to tease Baek-seo with undeniable evidence.\n‘Just deny it! I’ve got proof! Today’s the day I’ll finally get to tease her!’\nShe was ready for the big reveal, but—\n“With the Head.”\n“……!”\nThe calm and honest answer left Haye-song stunned.\nShe hadn’t expected Baek-seo to not deny it at all.\nEven Min-hyuk and Do-ha were shocked, staring at Baek-seo.\nSensing something big was about to happen, Haye-song subtly moved to block Baek-seo’s escape.\n“The Head’s weapons were destroyed, right? So you went to get new ones together?”\nWoo-jin had lost both his Iron Dragon Staff and Wall Strike Rod in the battle with Goliath. They’d all been destroyed.\n“That’s right. But haven’t you noticed something?”\nBaek-seo, puzzled by her colleagues’ reactions, dropped a bombshell.\n“I’m dating the Head.”\nSilence followed.\n“……!”\nHaye-song’s face paled with shock.\nDo-ha was frozen in disbelief.\nFinally, Min-hyuk broke the silence.\n“Well, damn…”\nBaek-seo chuckled softly as she watched her colleagues’ stunned expressions.\nAhn Woo-jin and Aseong High’s Student Council President, Han Baek-hyun, were seated in the back of a student council vehicle.\nIt was evening, and they were on their way back after a meeting at Hanyang Federal Academy.\nWoo-jin stared out the window absentmindedly, prompting Baek-hyun to ask curiously.\n“Ahn Woo-jin, is something wrong?”\n“Hmm?”\n“You’ve been down lately. Not just today—actually, you’ve seemed emotionally flat recently.”\n“There’s nothing major going on.”\n“Really?”\nBaek-hyun stared at Woo-jin intently.\n“…Why are you looking at me like that?”\n“I’m just wondering if it’s right for me to treat the strongest person in Neo Seoul like this.”\n“I don’t plan on defying society. Just treat me according to my role.”\n“That’s not what I mean.”\nBaek-hyun grinned and pointed upward with his finger.\n“Have you ever thought about aiming higher? To match your title as the strongest? If we combine my position with yours, there’s nothing we couldn’t do in this city.”\n“Hmm…”\nWoo-jin smiled faintly and looked back out the window.\n“I’ll think about it.”\n“This guy, acting all nonchalant…”\nThough the battle was over, Woo-jin now had a new dilemma weighing on his mind.\nHe gently touched the armband on his left arm, the symbol of his role as Disciplinary Head.\n‘The reason I became the Disciplinary Head…’\nThe purpose behind Woo-jin’s role as Disciplinary Head had disappeared.\nSo now, was there any need for him to keep holding onto this title?\nWhat kind of life should he pursue moving forward?\nThese thoughts swirled in Woo-jin’s mind like a thick fog.\n“Another serving, please!”\n“Haha! You sure can eat! Here’s some extra, on the house!”\n“Oooh, this fried fish is excellent!”\nWhile Woo-jin was attending the meeting at Hanyang Federal Academy, Geumyang was in a restaurant, happily devouring curry rice.\nWoo-jin had given him more than enough money for the meal, so he ordered various types of curry without hesitation.\n“Why is curry so delicious?!”\n“Because it’s curry! Hahaha!”\nThe restaurant owner, a female dropout, assumed Geumyang was playing a character with his unusual way of speaking and cheerfully went along with it.\nSince the owner had such a bright and agreeable personality, Geumyang had already become a regular at the restaurant.\nIt was during this enjoyable meal that something unusual happened.\n“……!”\nA sudden, formless sensation washed over Geumyang, making his entire body tremble.\nHe stopped mid-bite and stared at the air with a startled expression. The restaurant owner, noticing his reaction, asked, “What’s wrong? Something happen?”\n“No… The taste just overwhelmed me for a moment…”\n“Hahaha! What? You scared me for a second!”\nGeumyang resumed eating his curry, trying to compose himself.\n‘The main body… to contact me so abruptly…’\nThe sensation Geumyang had just felt was a signal from his main body—the Golden Sheep.\n[ His role is finished. ]\n[ Bring him to me. ]\nHearing the message, Geumyang groaned quietly.\n‘How do I even begin to explain this to that kid…’\nAt a café.\nAhn Woo-jin.\nOh Baek-seo.\nKim Dal-bi.\nThe three of them were having an awkward meeting.\n“……”\nWoo-jin was sweating nervously.\nBaek-seo calmly sipped her drink, occasionally smiling warmly at Dal-bi.\nDal-bi, on the other hand, fidgeted awkwardly with her fingers resting on her lap.\n‘Was I too hasty back then…?’\nAfter the battle with the Glutton, Woo-jin had been too caught up in his emotions and ended up declaring a harem in front of Baek-seo.\nLooking back, he realized how impulsive that had been.\nBaek-seo must have been shocked, and Woo-jin couldn’t even begin to imagine how she felt.\nWhile Neo Seoul encouraged population growth and didn’t adhere strictly to monogamy, harems were still a controversial topic.\nEver since Baek-seo and Dal-bi learned about Woo-jin’s harem ambitions, things between the three of them had been incredibly awkward. Even more so than before.\nAfter some polite small talk, which led nowhere, the tension continued to build. Woo-jin felt like he was sitting on a bed of nails.\n“Um… I just want to clarify something.”\nFinally, Dal-bi gathered the courage to break the silence. She turned to Woo-jin and asked:\n“You want both Baek-seo and me to be your girlfriends, right?”\n“Girlfriend? I’m planning to be his wife.”\nBaek-seo, without missing a beat, revealed her own intentions.\n“Th-that’s…! You can’t just say that so casually! You’re making Woo-jin uncomfortable…!”\nDal-bi blushed deeply, her face turning red like a ripe apple.\nHer eyes spun as her hands waved frantically in the air.\nShe was clearly flustered.\nAfter a few moments, she coughed and regained her composure, carefully tracing her fingers along the rim of her drink.\n“I mean, I’m happy as long as Woo-jin likes me. And… I guess you’re better than some stranger, Oh Baek-seo…”\nDal-bi cast an annoyed glance at Baek-seo. Her expression was far from satisfied.\nBaek-seo smiled gently.\n“Me too. At first, I was surprised, but I’ve had time to think it over. I’ve come to accept your relationship with Woo-jin, your past… and the fact that he can’t help but like you.”\n“I’m sorry. I know I was too sudden with it.”\nSeeing the opportunity, Woo-jin quickly apologized.\nBaek-seo took another sip of her drink through the straw.\n“It was sudden, but I’m actually thankful you told me right away. It gave me time to process everything. And honestly, I think it’s better that it’s you, Dal-bi.”\n“Then…?”\n“But there’s one thing I want to ask.”\nBaek-seo turned to Woo-jin with a soft smile, though a subtle chill lingered in the air.\nThis was the moment.\nThe chance to clear the air.\n“If both of you can accept me, then… ask me anything. I’ll answer honestly…”\n“Between me and Dal-bi, who do you like more?”\nBoom. Woo-jin’s heart dropped.\nDal-bi, curious as ever, stared at him with wide eyes.\nThe intense gazes of both women pierced Woo-jin’s soul.\nHe squeezed his eyes shut.\n‘I can’t back down. This is the labor of building a harem!’\nLike a general preparing for battle, Woo-jin steeled his resolve.\nWith newfound determination, he opened his eyes, ready to face the challenge.\nAnd there they were—Baek-seo and Dal-bi, leaning forward, eager for his answer.\n“...Phone-a-friend.”\nWoo-jin waved the white flag.\n“Why do I feel like you’re avoiding the question?” “It’s not like that…” “Then just answer.”\nWoo-jin’s poker face crumbled completely.\n‘...Somebody, please save me.’\nSweat poured down his back like a waterfall.",

      "content": "The final exams ended, and winter arrived.\nThe last semester of the 45th Disciplinary Head’s term was successfully concluded.\nDuring the winter break, the Disciplinary Committee would elect a new 46th Disciplinary Head.\nIt was now December 31st, and the Disciplinary Committee members gathered for a year-end party to close out the year.\n\"Why is the Head in a relationship!? Huh!?\"\nHaye-song shouted, pointing at Woo-jin with a chicken drumstick bone.\n\"A couple, a couple! That’s against the school rules! But since it’s between you and Baek-seo, no one can say anything! Is this what it feels like when your family member becomes a criminal?\"\n\"Wasn’t that rule abolished? It didn’t align with Neo Seoul’s ideology….\"\n\"And the abolition was probably pushed through secretly by you, right, Head? Otherwise, how could it happen so conveniently!? Is this the authority of Neo Seoul’s strongest!? I’m so jealous… Huh? Where are you going, Baek-seo?\"\nIn the middle of the gathering, Oh Baek-seo began packing her things and stood up.\nPark Min-hyuk and Yoo Do-ha, having already heard from Baek-seo, were ready to let her go. But Haye-song, too busy complaining to Woo-jin, hadn’t noticed.\n“I think she’s tired from finishing the last bit of work. Sorry, but I need to head home and rest.”\n\"Baek-seo, you worked hard. It’s a shame to miss the year-end party, but we’ll see each other again soon! Take care!\"\nHaye-song cheerfully let her leave.\nWoo-jin, on the other hand, looked surprised.\n“Were you that tired? Sorry, I didn’t notice.”\n“No worries. Enjoy yourself.”\nBaek-seo placed a hand on Woo-jin’s shoulder and whispered something to him.\n“I’ll be waiting.”\nWaiting? What did she mean by that?\n“Uh… okay. Get some rest.”\nSince Baek-seo and Woo-jin lived next door to each other, her comment about heading home first didn’t seem odd to him.\nWith a meaningful smile, Baek-seo left the party.\n\"Head… do you think someone like me could ever be in a relationship?\"\nOut of nowhere, Park Min-hyuk asked, looking glum.\nIt seemed he was feeling lonely, given it was the end of the year.\n“I expect the effect of the rule abolition will be significant. People will loosen up. Or you could try picking someone up here.”\n“I-I’m not brave enough for that…!\"\nAt that moment, Haye-song burst out laughing and pointed at Min-hyuk.\n“Min-hyuk, picking someone up!? What did that poor girl do to deserve that!?”\n“I’m going to kill you…”\nMin-hyuk trembled in frustration.\nMeanwhile, Do-ha quietly ate her chicken. Her silence didn’t go unnoticed by Haye-song.\n“Do-ha, why so quiet? Something bothering you?”\n“No, nothing. Just listening to the conversation.”\n“Yeah, yeah, Do-ha. It’s about couples, right? Let’s stick together as singles!”\nHaye-song draped her arm over Do-ha’s shoulder playfully. Do-ha cast a sidelong glance at Woo-jin, but he was too busy giving Min-hyuk advice to notice.\nAfter some more time, the group wrapped up the party, said their goodbyes, and parted ways.\n\"Take care! See you next year!\"\n\"Bye.\"\n\"Be safe.\"\nThe night sky was pouring down white snow.\nIt was past midnight, January 1st.\nThey had become adults.\nBefore heading home, Woo-jin reached out to create a spatial rift but decided against it. Instead, he walked through the city.\nHe found the sight of the falling snow particularly pleasing.\n‘I still don’t know…’\nEven after the year-end party, Woo-jin’s internal conflict remained unresolved.\nWhat exactly was this \"moderately happy life\" that he had always wanted?\nHis focus had always been on preventing the dystopian future, and beyond that, he hadn’t thought much.\nWhile he had plenty of time to reflect, the answers remained elusive.\n“Head.”\n“Yeah?”\n“Why aren’t you using your spatial jump? You don’t need to walk.”\nDo-ha, who was walking in the same direction as Woo-jin toward the bus stop, asked curiously.\n“The snow’s pretty. Besides, I’ll walk you to the stop.”\n“I see.”\nDo-ha, somewhat flustered, tucked her hair behind her ear, exposing her neck. Her ponytail swayed lightly.\n“That reminds me, I used to sweat bullets trying to get you to your post back when you were a first-year.”\n“…Really?”\n“To be honest, yeah. That’s why we used to walk together so much.”\n“I didn’t know it was so tough.”\n“I was just trying to save face.”\n“…Sorry.”\n“I didn’t mention it to get an apology. Actually, I don’t even think an apology is necessary.”\nDo-ha glanced at Woo-jin, who was grinning playfully.\nHaving spent two years together, since the days when she was a new member of the Disciplinary Committee, Woo-jin seemed to have become more open with her.\n“…”\nFor a moment, Do-ha found herself staring at his smile.\nThey soon arrived at the bus stop.\nThe buses were still running.\nThey stood there side by side, waiting.\n“Do-ha, I have a question.”\n“What is it?”\n“As a Disciplinary Head, how was I?”\nThe city, blanketed in snow and silence, surrounded them.\nDo-ha also turned her gaze to the falling snow.\n“As a Disciplinary Head… I thought you were a good fit. I can’t think of anything else to say except that you were good.”\n“Good? I didn’t expect such praise…”\nJust then, the bus arrived, its lights cutting through the snow.\n“Take care. It was fun.”\n“Yeah, you too, Head.”\nDo-ha said her goodbyes and got on the bus, but after taking a few steps, she paused. Without turning to face Woo-jin, she spoke softly.\n“I didn’t just mean as a Disciplinary Head.”\n“Huh?”\n“I meant… as a colleague too. Never mind, just take care.”\n“Uh, okay…”\n“See you around.”\nLeaving those cryptic words behind, Do-ha finally boarded the bus.\nThe door closed with a soft hiss.\nWoo-jin watched the bus drive away before turning to walk home.\n“Haa…”\nDo-ha, resting her head against the bus window, let out a quiet sigh.\nShe was forcing down emotions she would never fully express.\nClick.\nWoo-jin unlocked his front door.\n“Huh?”\nAs soon as he stepped inside, he was startled.\nBaek-seo, dressed in casual clothes, greeted him at the entrance like a wife waiting for her husband.\n“Welcome home.”\n“You? Didn’t you say you were tired and went home early? What are you doing here?”\n“Because I’m your girl.”\nBaek-seo smiled mischievously, resting her finger against her chin.\nLately, perhaps influenced by their relationship, she seemed to have picked up a few cute gestures from somewhere.\n‘Ugh…!’\nWoo-jin’s heart took a heavy hit.\nWhen a cute girlfriend shows affection, it melts a man’s heart.\n“Y-yeah, right…”\n“Actually, I wanted to see you before bed. I even prepared a late-night snack, just in case.”\nWoo-jin entered the living room and noticed drinks and snacks laid out on the table, illuminated by a soft, glowing lamp.\nThrough the balcony window, he could see the falling snow.\nThe atmosphere was cozy and romantic.\n‘So that’s what she meant by going ahead first.’\nIt seemed Baek-seo had wanted to spend the New Year’s Eve together with her boyfriend.\nRealizing this, Woo-jin lamented his obliviousness, having missed all the signs.\n“Baek-seo, I just thought of something.”\n“Yeah? What is it?”\n“I want to ask you a favor.”\n“A favor?”\nWoo-jin pulled out a card from his pocket. As soon as Baek-seo saw it, her eyes widened slightly.\n[ Oh Baek-seo Coupon ]\nIt was a coupon he had received in the first semester. Its effect? She would clean his ears.\nAs surprise gave way to a soft smile, Baek-seo’s face lit up.\nLater, Baek-seo sat on the sofa while Woo-jin lay down, resting his head in her lap.\nWoo-jin exposed his ear to her, feeling a wave of bliss.\n“Hey, Head, you know what?”\nBaek-seo smiled gently.\n“What?”\n“This is my first time cleaning someone else’s ears.”\n“Really? Well, do your best, hoo—ack!”\nAs soon as the ear cleaner entered his ear, Woo-jin gasped.\nShe had gone too deep, triggering an intense sensation.\nStartled, Baek-seo quickly withdrew the tool, a bead of sweat forming on her brow.\n“Did I hurt you? Did I go too deep?”\n“It’s okay… You’ll get the hang of it. First time and all.”\n“I’ll be careful.”\n“Thanks.”\n‘I assumed she’d be good at everything…’\nWoo-jin had taken Baek-seo’s perfection for granted.\nEven though she had already told him she wasn’t perfect.\nWhat a foolish assumption.\nSoon enough, though, Baek-seo’s touch became more adept.\nThe sensation was pleasant enough that Woo-jin’s mouth involuntarily curled into a smile.\n“Hey, why use the coupon today?”\nBaek-seo’s soft voice tickled Woo-jin’s ear.\n“No particular reason. It just came to mind.”\nIn truth, it was because of the uncertainty that had settled in after the Academy War.\nWoo-jin was trying to enjoy the things he cherished more deeply. It was part of why he’d stayed late with the Disciplinary Committee members, indulging in the party.\nHe hoped that by doing so, his worries would resolve themselves.\n“I see…”\n“?”\nBaek-seo’s smile turned slightly cryptic.\n“Are you enjoying it?”\n“Very much.”\n“I’m glad to hear that. Now for the other ear.”\nWoo-jin moved to switch sides but stopped halfway.\nJust as he was about to turn fully, Baek-seo gently placed a hand on his shoulder, urging him to stay still.\n“Hold on.”\nHer voice was soft, almost like she was soothing a child.\nBaek-seo looked down at Woo-jin with a serene smile.\n“Baek-seo…?”\n“Stay put for a second. You just look so… lovable.”\nThe sincerity in her gaze wrapped around Woo-jin like a warm blanket.\nHe felt heat rising to his face.\n“Uh, yeah… I should probably finish this later. I forgot to take a shower.”\n‘I can’t handle this level of intimacy!’\nOverwhelmed by embarrassment, Woo-jin tried to sit up. But before he could, Baek-seo placed her hand on the back of his head.\n“Huh?”\nThump.\nShe gently pushed him back onto the sofa, his head resting against the armrest.\nBaek-seo leaned over him, her shadow casting a soft veil.\n“Where are you going?”\nHer voice, though still kind, carried a hint of authority.\nFor some reason, Woo-jin now saw Baek-seo as a predator closing in on her prey.\n“We’re adults now, aren’t we? Shouldn’t you make better use of that coupon?”\n“Wait, Baek—?”\nBefore Woo-jin could finish, Baek-seo silenced him with a kiss.\nHis eyes went wide before he quickly closed them.\nTheir lips parted and pressed together again as they deepened the kiss, lost in each other.\nBaek-seo kept her hand on the back of Woo-jin’s head, ensuring he wouldn’t pull away, her kiss growing bolder.\nFor a while, the kiss lingered.\nThen, Woo-jin pushed up, grabbing Baek-seo by the wrists and gently flipping her over onto the sofa.\nSmooch.\nThe kiss ended with a faint, sticky sound as their lips parted.\nBoth of them stared at each other.\nBaek-seo’s cheeks were flushed, her breath heavy, but her eyes sparkled with happiness.\nYet, tears welled up in her eyes.\nWoo-jin’s heart skipped a beat.\n“Baek-seo? Did I hurt you?”\n“No, it’s because I’m happy…”\nHer voice was soft, and she whispered through her tears.\nBecause, at one point, Baek-seo never thought this future was possible.\n“I love you, Woo-jin.”\n“…I love you, too.”\nBaek-seo leaned in for another kiss, and Woo-jin met her halfway.\nFor a while, they continued their kiss.\nAt that moment.\nA girl with pink hair landed quietly on Woo-jin’s balcony.\n‘Didn’t Baek-seo leave the party early, saying she was tired?’\nRecalling the report from a low-ranking goblin monitoring the Disciplinary Committee members, she steeled her resolve.\n‘This is my chance! I’ve already made up my mind… I can do this…!’\nKim Dal-bi’s heart pounded so hard she thought it might explode, but she pushed forward, determination in her eyes.\nShe was dressed in a cute Santa costume.\nAccording to her research, wearing something like this for her boyfriend would make him lose his mind with happiness.\n‘Alright, here we go!’\nShe stepped forward, sliding the balcony door open.\nShe snuck in like a thief, careful not to make a sound.\n“Huh?”\n“Huh?”\n“Uh…?”\nWhat she saw left her breathless.\nWoo-jin and Baek-seo stared at her in shock, just as she stared at them.\nDal-bi’s wide eyes filled with confusion.\nThe air became heavy as she slowly realized.\n‘Baek-seo… leaving early was a trap!’\nIndeed, this was the battlefield of a harem.\nThe unprepared would be left behind.\nBut Dal-bi was also one of Woo-jin’s girlfriends.\nShe wouldn’t lose.\nHuffing, Santa Dal-bi stepped forward, determination glinting in her eyes.\n“Dal-bi? That outfit…”\nWoo-jin, sitting up in surprise, tried to speak, but Dal-bi marched right up to him.\nWith her red-gloved hands, she cupped his face.\nSmooch.\nShe kissed him.\nAwkwardly, but boldly, her lips pressed against his.\nDal-bi’s heart raced so fast she thought she might faint, but she couldn’t falter now.\nTo survive this war, she had to be aggressive.\nShe had to be decisive.\nAnd so, Dal-bi kissed Woo-jin with all her might, forgetting to breathe.\n“……!”\nA crack appeared in Baek-seo’s composure.\nHer smile faltered, and though she tried to remain calm, the corner of her lips twitched with barely restrained fury.\n“Dear, you know… it’s rude to interrupt.”\nThe rivalry had ignited.\nBaek-seo pulled Woo-jin back into her embrace.\nAnd as the night wore on, until the morning sun rose, Woo-jin found himself caught between the two women, utterly consumed by their affections.\nThe Novel will be updated first on this website.
