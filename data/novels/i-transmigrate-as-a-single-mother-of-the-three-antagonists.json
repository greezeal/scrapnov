      "content": "Chapter 1: Selling Children\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\n“Pfft! What are you talking about? We agreed that a child would cost $15,000, and now you’re raising the price at the last minute? And you want to fight me too?!”\n“Hey, wake up! Qiu Tong, don’t play dead. You were the one who pulled at me first. I only blocked you and you hit the corner of the table yourself… I won’t compensate you if you die!”\nStill in a daze, Qiu Tong heard someone cursing.\nSomeone tried to kick her.\nShe opened her eyes and saw the tattered roof.\nShifting her gaze, she saw a middle-aged woman with a mean face. She was dressed gaudily and had thick makeup on. It was obvious that she was not a good person.\nQiu Tong was stunned. She wasn’t dead?\nShe lived in the post-apocalyptic era and struggled to survive. She leveled up and finally became a young general. However, in the final major battle of the century, her heart was dug out by zombies while she was trying to protect her teammates.\nCould she have become a zombie too?\nNo, that’s not right.\nThe woman before her clearly did not look like someone from the post-apocalyptic era.\nHow could a woman who grew up in the post-apocalyptic era be so fat and dressed so flamboyantly?\n“Yo, you’re not playing dead anymore?”\nThe woman said, “If you’re awake, quickly get up and sign it. $45,000, I’ll transfer it to you later! I’m making a loss here. Take a look for yourself. All three of your children are so skinny. Only Qiu Xingyu is better. She can be sold for a good price.”\n“Besides, they are already six years old. It’s not easy to find a buyer! If you weren’t recommended by Lin Shan… Hmph! Who would want to buy your children!”\nQiu Tong looked in the direction of her finger.\nIn the corner, three children cowered.\nTwo boys and a girl.\nThey were said to be six years old, but due to malnutrition, the three children looked only about four years old. They were short and thin, making their eyes look especially big.\nAt this moment, they were huddled together and looked at Qiu Tong fearfully, as if they knew their fate of being sold off. Their eyes were filled with endless fear and uneasiness…\nAnd a deeply-hidden hatred.\nSix-year-old children could harbor such deep hatred… Qiu Tong’s back suddenly turned cold.\nWait a minute.\nQiu Tong, Qiu Xingyu, selling children?!\nWhen these keywords were combined, Qiu Tong suddenly remembered that before the post-apocalyptic war, she had read an antique 21st century novel on her computer.\nOne of the villains in the book was called Qiu Xingyu. She had two villains as her brothers, and the mother of these three villains was also called Qiu Tong and had the same name as her.\nThis Qiu Tong was greedy and vicious. She had given birth to triplets but did not remember who the father was.\nAs a single mother, she had no thoughts of improving her situation. Relying on charity grants, she brought her children to live in the slums for six years. She would hit and scold her children all day long.\nAnd this year, Qiu Tong had hooked up with a scumbag. In order to please the scumbag, she had sold her children and ran off with the money to marry him!\nOf course, the ending was tragic.\nQiu Tong was cheated of all her money by the scumbag who eventually dumped her. Without any skills, Qiu Tong could only return to the slums. However, the days she spent with the scumbag made her a drug addict. To get drugs, she had no choice but to become a sex worker.\nThe three children who had been sold off had turned into three villains. When they had the ability, they went to look for Qiu Tong and took revenge on her.\nIn the end, Qiu Tong died tragically in the wilderness without even anyone to give her a proper burial…\n“…”\nQiu Tong fell silent.\nHad she been reborn in the body of this vicious mother with the same name?\nShe had rather enjoyed the storyline when she first read it, but now that it was happening to her, she was not finding it very enjoyable.\nFortunately, she had transmigrated before she sold her children. Coupled with the fact that she knew the ending to this story, she might be able to change it!\nQiu Tong immediately got up from the ground, dusted herself off and said coldly.\n“Sorry, I’m not selling my children anymore.”",

      "content": "Chapter 2: Increase The Price\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nThe flamboyant woman was not the only one who was shocked at her words. Even the three children in the corner widened their eyes in astonishment.\nQiu Xingyu, born third, tugged on her elder brother’s sleeve and whispered.\n“Brother, Mommy doesn’t seem to want to sell us anymore.”\n“…”\nThe firstborn Qiu Xingyuan pursed his lips coldly. “Who knows what evil idea she has up her sleeve. All these years, have we not trusted her enough? She disappointed us every single time.”\nQiu Xingqiao, who was born second, clenched his fists. “How many times have I told you not to call her mommy? That bad woman is not our mommy at all!”\nQiu Xingyu shrank back and stopped talking.\nQiu Tong:”…”\nDid these brats think she was deaf?\nAfter living in post-apocalyptic times for so many years, her senses were very sharp. Even though they were whispering, she could hear them clearly.\nHowever, now was not the time to argue with them.\nQiu Tong waved at the three children. “Let’s go home.”\nThe three children stiffened.\nHome?\nDid they still have a home?\nThe flamboyant woman finally returned to her senses. “Qiu Tong, are you kidding me? Do you think you can refuse to sell them just like that?! Let me tell you, you have to sell them to me today even if you’re unwilling!”\nQiu Tong looked at the other party’s ferocious expression, her fat quivering, and she was very calm.\nIf it had been the original Qiu Tong, she might have been afraid, but this Qiu Tong was not afraid at all.\n“Sure.”\nQiu Tong nodded. “Increase the price. Each child will cost 100 million.”\nUpon hearing this, Qiu Xingyu’s bright eyes immediately dimmed.\nShe thought that Mommy had changed.\nBut she just wanted to raise the price…\nHowever, Mommy was destined to be disappointed. They had not had a full meal since the day they were born, so how could they fetch a high price of 100 million?\nFat Auntie would never agree.\nAs expected, the flamboyant woman jumped when she heard that. “Are you crazy? Do you think you gave birth to golden geese? You’re asking for a sky-high price! You’re indeed the daughter of a financial fraud. You deserve to give birth to three illegitimate children who don’t even know their fathers… Ah!”\nSmack!\nThe woman’s scolding was interrupted by the clear sound of a slap.\nQiu Tong retracted her hand and rotated her wrist. “Didn’t anyone teach you not to make personal attacks when scolding others?”\n“Ah!”\nThe flamboyant woman shrieked in rage. “How dare you hit me! Slut, how dare you hit me!”\nShe charged towards Qiu Tong.\nHer body was huge and she shot over like a missile. One would definitely die or be crippled by the impact.\nQiu Xingyu covered her eyes in fear.\nBang!\nThere was a loud bang.\nThe little girl peaked through a gap between her fingers and was stunned!\nHer mother, who was lazy and claimed that she did not have the strength to work, fluidly flipped the fat woman over her shoulder and threw her onto the ground!\nShe then picked up a wooden table and was about to throw it at the other party!\n“Ah! Help!”\nThe woman’s pupils constricted. Her earlier arrogance had disappeared and was replaced with deep fear. “Fine, don’t sell if you don’t want to! I was wrong, I’m sorry! Please just go… just go…”\nShe watched as the table came nearer and nearer, a wind blowing against her face. She nearly peed her pants from fright.\nThe table came to a stop about 10 centimeters away from her.\nQiu Tong loosened her grip and flung the table to the ground. She licked her lips and revealed a charming and bloodthirsty smile.\n“Ah, I almost forgot. Humans are very fragile. We can’t treat you like zombies.”\nThe woman was so frightened that her face turned pale. She collapsed to the ground, unable to say a word.\nQiu Tong turned around and waved at the three children. “Aren’t you coming?”\nWith that, she walked out of the door.\nIt was already dusk outside. The rays of the setting sun gently enveloped the entire city, casting a shadow over the dilapidated buildings of the slums.\nQiu Tong took a deep breath. This world was really good.\nSo what if it was a slum?\nAt least, there was no endless fighting, famine or war.\nIt was just that she was short of money for the time being. She had the ability. As long as she worked hard, she would be able to earn money.\nQiu Tong decided to return to her accomodations.\nBut… where was her home?",

      "content": "Chapter 3: Falling Into The Water\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nQiu Tong did not inherit any memories from the former owner of her body, so she was a little lost.\nShe turned around to ask the three children.\nThe moment she turned her head, the three children who had been following her from afar startled and took a few steps back. It was as if she was a human-eating demon.\nUnder the faint light outside, Qiu Tong could see that the three children were all very beautiful. They had big eyes, long eyelashes and exquisite facial features.\nIf not for their dull, dry hair and sunken cheeks, they would have been even more beautiful.\nSigh.\nQiu Tong sighed. It was all her body’s former owner’s fault.\nShe didn’t want to bring them further fear, so she just continued walking forward. This place wasn’t very big anyway. It wouldn’t be too hard to find.\nQiu Tong walked a few blocks and stopped by a river, looking around.\nThe three children behind her were whispering.\nQiu Xingyu said, “Look, Mommy really didn’t sell us!”\nQiu Xingqiao snorted. “That’s only because she wanted to raise the price! Eldest Brother, what should we do? She didn’t manage to sell us for 100 million. Will she beat us up again tonight and not give us any food?”\nThe former Qiu Tong was indeed like this. As long as they did not satisfy her, she would treat them very badly.\nQiu Xingyuan’s gaze was cold and he did not speak.\nHe saw with his own eyes that this woman had suddenly become very powerful.\nShe could already beat them half to death before today. Wouldn’t she be able to beat them to death now?\nNo, he could not let her beat his younger siblings to death!\nToday, she must die or they would!\nQiu Xingyuan cleared his throat. A dangerous plan formed in his mind. He sent his sister to the side to play. He asked Qiu Xingqiao to stay and told him his plan.\n“This…”\nQiu Xingqiao was shocked. “This is wrong…”\nQiu Xingyuan said in a low voice, “If not, do you want us to be beaten to death by her?!”\nIn the end, Qiu Xingqiao gritted his teeth and agreed.\nQiu Tong was speechless as she listened to their conversation.\nThis was indeed a future big villain. He dared to talk about killing her now. What would happen in the future?\nFootsteps from behind could be heard.\nQiu Tong did not move and pretended not to notice.\nShe could not be bothered to fuss with children. She did not intend to stay in this place. If she let them succeed in their scheme this time, she would be able to help them dispel some of their psychological trauma. She considered this her good deed of the day.\nAfter all, the original Qiu Tong was inhuman. Since she had inherited the body of the original owner, she would take this as a chance to help her atone for her sins.\nThe next second—\nA pair of small hands pushed her hard on her back!\nQiu Tong fell forward and lost her balance. She fell into the water and was soon engulfed by the waves.\n“…”\n“…”\nThe fierce Qiu Xingyuan stood by the river and looked at the river. His lips were tightly pursed and his entire body was still trembling.\nHe had been prepared to die if he failed.\nBut it was so easy.\nThe woman who had abused them for so many years actually fell without a word. He felt like he was dreaming.\nQiu Xingqiao pounced on him. “Eldest Brother…”\nQiu Xingyuan pretended to be calm. Only his trembling voice revealed that he was not calm at all.\n“Go get Little Yu. Let’s go home.”\nAt night.\nThe three children spent their first night without Qiu Tong. Although they did not have anything to eat, it was the first time that there was no one to scold and beat them.\nThey laid side by side on the small bed, staring at the dim ceiling.\nQiu Xingyu clutched her concave stomach. She was sensible and did not ask for food. Instead, she blinked innocently.\n“Eldest Brother, Second Brother, where did Mommy go?”\nShe was well protected by her two older brothers and was still a little naive. Her impression of Qiu Tong improved a little since she brought them back today.\nQiu Xingyuan patted his sister and coaxed her to sleep. “She has already gone on to a better life and doesn’t want us anymore. In the future, no one will hit or scold you anymore. Aren’t you happy about that?”\n“Happy, but…”\nUnable to fight off sleep any longer, Qiu Xingyu fell asleep.\nQiu Xingqiao finally dared to stammer, “Eldest Brother, do you think… that woman… is she dead?”\nQiu Xingyuan grunted in affirmation.\nDead.\nHe had seen with his own eyes that the woman had sunk to the bottom of the water without a single bubble emerging.\nQiu Xingqiao trembled again. “Then… will she become a ghost… and come find us?”\nThere was not much entertainment in the slums. All kinds of ghost stories became the best bedtime stories for adults to coax children to sleep. They also often heard scary myths and legends.\nQiu Xingyuan’s body stiffened.\nHe was a child after all, so he was naturally afraid of ghosts. He shook his head forcefully and was about to comfort himself with the words “there are no ghosts in this world”.\nThe next second, a wet head appeared at the bedside. It was Qiu Tong’s face!\n“Ah!!!”\nThe two brats cried out in fright!",

Coupled with her pale face and wet hair, it was terrifying!\nQiu Xingqiao was so frightened that he hugged Qiu Xingyuan tightly. In his fear, he did not notice that his elder brother’s body had also stiffened slightly.\n“Eldest Brother! She… she really turned into a ghost and came back to take revenge on us!”\nQiu Xingqiao covered his mouth as he whimpered softly.\nA faint smile appeared on Qiu Tong’s face. This young future villain wasn’t that brave after all!\n“Oh? So noisy. Did something happen?”\nQiu Xingyu rubbed her eyes and got up from the bed. When she saw Qiu Tong, she muttered in a daze, “Mommy? Haven’t you already gone on to a better life? Why… are you back?”\nQiu Tong looked at the two boys.\nDamn! They really knew how to spin sweet stories! Better life?!\nShe was just about to clarify things with the little girl when she saw Qiu Xingyuan grab two bricks and threw them at her!\nWas he serious?!\nMurdering his own mother a second time?\nQiu Tong bent over and dodged a few rocks and coal flying towards her. Grabbing one child in each hand, she threw them back onto the bed!\n“Go to sleep!”\nQiu Xingyuan narrowed his eyes and used his frail body to shield his brother and sister behind him, glaring at her warily!\nThe woman’s hands were warm. She probably wasn’t a ghost.\nBut why did she seem like a different person?\nShe didn’t beat them even though they had pushed her into the river?\nWith her current fighting abilities, it was enough to beat them half to death!\n“Mommy seems to have become nicer?” Qiu Xingyu tugged at the corner of her brother’s shirt.\nBut Qiu Xingyuan just furrowed his brows in deep thought and said, “Who knows if she’s planning something else!”\nQiu Ton was exasperated.\nDid she really need to hear their secret whisperings?\nShe changed out of her wet clothes and dried her hair. She looked around, studying the surroundings.\nTheir living environment was truly dilapidated. The straw shed was riddled with holes, looking as though it could be blown away by the wind anytime! The so-called kitchen area did not even have half a grain of rice!\nThese little fellows were indeed quite pitiful!\n“Shh!”\nTaking advantage of Qiu Tong still checking out the kitchen, Qiu Xingyuan had Qiu Xingyu on his back and his younger brother’s hand. He planned to climb over the wall and sneak out with them!\nHe didn’t believe that the Qiu Tong would truly change!\nHe had to take his younger siblings away!\nOtherwise, they might be separated tomorrow. Sold to different places!\nQiu Tong noticed all his movements and was in no rush to grab them. It was only when Qiu Xingyuan was clinging clumsily onto the wall and was about to fall down and bash his head that she ran over!\n“Be careful!”\nQiu Tong caught Qiu Xingyu firmly in her arms. She kicked away a few falling rocks and pulled the two brats back!\nBoom!\nWith a loud bang, half the wall collapsed… leaving behind only debris and dust!\nQiu Xingqiao was so frightened that he hiccuped and whispered, “Elder Brother, Mommy… Mommy saved us.”\nThis was highly abnormal!\nQiu Xingyuan looked at Qiu Tong with a complicated expression. She actually didn’t leave them to their fate?\nOnce, Little Yu had been hit by a falling tile and Qiu Tong viciously scolded Little Yu that she deserved it and wished that they would all die sooner.\nHad she really changed for the better?\nThe next second, Qiu Tong threw them onto the bed again and threatened them with a smile.\n“If you try to run away again, I will throw you all into the river to feed the fishes.”\nQiu Xingyuan: “…”\nHe knew that she was still as evil as ever!\nQiu Tong found two tattered blankets and covered them, before she also laid down beside them.\nAfter fighting for so long in the post-apocalyptic era, she was exhausted. She planned to rest for a night before leaving.\nQiu Xingyu blinked and tugged at the corner of her shirt nervously.\nQiu Tong felt sorry for her and tried her best to be gentle. “Can’t sleep? Do you need Mommy to sing you a lullaby?”\nQiu Xingyu looked at her lovingly and nodded.\nQiu Tong shifted through her memory before starting to sing, “Long tongue, bloodstained hands, fresh zombies surrounding us, watch me shoot its head off…”\nThe children: “!!!”\nQiu Tong felt that something was wrong. “Don’t you think it’s a nice song?”\nThis was the most popular nursery rhyme in the post-apocalyptic world.\n“Nice…”\nQiu Xingyu was trembling as she held onto her two brothers. She was so stiff that she did not move at all. “Mommy, we’re sleepy. Please stop singing…”\nQiu Tong nodded in satisfaction and closed her eyes.\nShe knew that lullabies were useful!",

He quietly woke Qiu Xingqiao up and carried Little Yu away.\nUnder the locust tree.\nQiu Xingyuan said in a low but steady voice, “She must have been possessed by a ghost and wants to kill us.”\nThe auntie from next door once said that there were grievous ghosts in the water. Qiu Tong must have been possessed by one such ghost when she fell into the water.\nOtherwise, why would she behave so abnormally?\nNot only was she highly-skilled, she even sang those weird songs…\nQiu Xingqiao’s face turned pale.\nQiu Xingyuan was rather calm. Human or ghost, no one could harm his younger siblings!\n“Go and find some paper money! Burn some to exorcise the ghost!”\n“I’ll tie her up. Don’t be afraid, I will protect you!”\nQiu Xingyuan directed Qiu Xingqiao while he ran back into the house. He looked at the sleeping Qiu Tong and tied her hands up with a hemp rope.\nHe mimicked the way they did it on television, drawing the sign of a cross and muttering some lines.\nQiu Tong had eavesdropped on the little rascal’s exorcism ritual. She secretly opened one eye and saw the paper money scattered all over the yard.\nShe tried not to laugh.\nThe post-apocalyptic life had made Qiu Ying extremely vigilant. The slightest sound was enough to wake her up.\nThe only reason Qiu Tong had kept silent and allowed the two brats to fool around was because she wanted to see what they could do!\n“Eldest Brother, should we read some Buddhist scriptures?” Qiu Xingqiao asked when he entered bearing a candle.\nQiu Xingyuan shook his head and took the candle, approaching Qiu Tong’s bed.\nQiu Xingqiao exclaimed softly, “Are you going to burn her to death?! She’s… she’s…”\nHe still could not bring himself to say the word “mommy” no matter what.\n“She’s already possessed by a ghost. She’s a demon, no longer that woman.”\nQiu Xingyuan said this, but his hands were trembling. She did not hit them today and even told them a story, even though the story was very bloody…\nAt that moment, Qiu Tong turned around—\nQiu Xingyuan’s hands trembled and the candle fell onto the bed. In an instant, a fire spread out uncontrollably!\nThe two brats were stunned.\nQiu Tong: “…”\nShe did not want to be burned to death!\nShe could no longer pretend. She escaped from her rope bindings and grabbed the two boys, throwing them onto a safe spot outside. Thereafter, she rushed into the house and used a blanket to extinguish the flames.\nAfter a while, Qiu Tong came out with a cold face.\nThese two brats were really troublesome!\nQiu Xingyuan thought that she wanted to settle the score with them and he stood in front of Qiu Xingqiao protectively. “What do you want! I was the one who planned this. If you want to beat someone, beat me. Don’t hurt them…”\nQiu Tong stared at him coldly for a while before returning to her room to pack.\nShe could not stay here any longer.\nShe wanted to stay behind to have a good night’s sleep, but those two little devils were too troublesome. She would leave tonight.\nQiu Tong searched every corner of the house and found very few things she could use.\nApart from two stale buns, there were only a few crumpled notes hidden behind a beam.\nIt looked like the former Qiu Tong was afraid that the children would steal it.\nQiu Tong only took her ID card and stuffed the remaining notes and stale buns into Qiu Xingyuan’s hands.\n“I’m leaving. I’ll leave these for you. Take good care of your younger siblings. Don’t be as stupid as you were just now. You almost lost your own life trying to kill someone. You need to be law-abiding citizens.”\nShe had said everything that needed to be said!\nWhether these children would still grow up to be villains—that was not something she could control!\nAt least with her gone, they would be able to live a little more comfortably, right?\nQiu Xingyuan gripped the notes tightly. He was momentarily taken aback. “Where are you going?”\nWas this really woman going to abandon them?\nQiu Tong looked at his young but determined face and smiled. “Just take it that I’m dead.”\nThe children: “…”\nShe strode off. Qiu Xingyu looked at her departing back profile. “Eldest Brother… Mommy doesn’t want us anymore?”\nQiu Xingyuan remained silent. He was feeling rather conflicted.\nThere were several times when he wished for Qiu Tong to leave them. He even really wished that she would die.\nBut now that she had really left, his heart felt heavy.\nAfter all, he was still just a six-year-old child.\nQiu Xingyuan hugged his younger brother and sister and comforted them, “Don’t be afraid, so what if she has left? We don’t need her! I will take care of you!”",

      "content": "Chapter 6: Supporting The Family\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nThe next morning, the rising sun illuminated most of the streets.\nAs Qiu Tong walked along, she was amazed by everything around her.\nThe streets were bustling with people and the stalls along the road were filled with smoke and activity.\nQiu Tong’s eyes lit up. This was a completely different living environment from the post-apocalyptic world.\nA large group of people surrounded the entrance of a flour shop at the corner of the street. Qiu Tong curiously looked over and was surprised to see a familiar young face in the middle of the crowd.\nQiu Xingyuan seemed to have fallen into a pile of flour. His hair, face and clothes were all white.\nHis tiny body was stiff and upright. He clenched his fists and his eyes were distressed. “I’ve already carried 10 bags of flour inside. You have to give me my salary!”\nThe boss of the flour shop was a tall and thin man with a shrewd look. He was holding a weight in his hand and his face was filled with impatience. “Get lost. Where did this wild child come from? You said you carried 10 bags of flour? But I didn’t see it.”\n“And you’re not an employee of my store. Why should I pay you?”\nQiu Xingyuan pursed his lips even tighter, his little face gloomy.\nIn order to support his siblings, he had to work to earn money.\nHowever, he was too young and no one dared to hire him. He had finally gotten the boss of the flour shop to agree, but now, the other party was going back on his word!\nQiu Xingyuan jumped forward angrily and tugged hard on the other party’s sleeve. “Give me my money! Give me my money!”\nThe boss of the flour shop swung around hard and the small body flew away. He slammed heavily against the counter, his forehead quickly turning red.\nQiu Tong was shocked and quickly approached Qiu Xingyuan. When she saw the fingernail-sized wound on his forehead, her eyes turned cold.\n“You dare to bully even a child. Are you still human?!”\nHer bright eyes were lit with anger. The boss of the flour shop denied guiltily. “I didn’t do it on purpose. He suddenly pounced over…”\nAs more and more people gathered around, the boss of the flour shop felt a little remorse. He disdainfully tossed out a penny. “It’s just my bad luck. Take the money and get lost!”\nLooking at the coin rolling toward her, Qiu Tong’s eyes glinted harshly. She raised her hand and smacked the countertop, leaving a deep dent.\n“Apologize!”\nHer tone was cold and her eyes were filled with murderous intent.\nThe boss of the flour shop was so scared that his face was pale. He hurriedly picked up the coin and shoved it into Qiu Xingyuan’s hands. “Sorry, I was greedy. This is your salary!”\nOnly then did Qiu Tong reluctantly give a soft snort. She walked up to Qiu Xingyuan and squatted down. “Are you alright? Does it still hurt?”\nQiu Xingyuan did not expect to meet Qiu Tong again. And she had actually stood up for him. For a moment there, his face bore a conflicted expression.\nSeeing that blood was still flowing down his forehead, a dark light flashed across Qiu Tong’s eyes. Using her own body as cover, she slowly pressed her palm against Qiu Xingyuan’s forehead to stop the bleeding.\nThat was her superpower in the post-apocalyptic era—healing.\nA strange warmth spread from her body. Qiu Xingyuan suddenly had the desire to lean closer to Qiu Tong, but he restrained himself.\nNo, this woman must be regretting yesterday and now wanted to come back to sell them off!\nQiu Xingyuan warned himself fiercely that he absolutely could not trust this woman anymore. He gripped the coin tightly and pushed Qiu Tong away, before running away without looking back.\nQiu Tong didn’t even have time to call after him. She could only watch his departing back profile.\nShe wondered how the other two kids were doing. How did they end up in this situation, where they had to come out to work at such a young age?\nFortunately, Qiu Tong was skilled in detection and easily located Qiu Xingyuan’s position. She quietly followed him.\nQiu Xingyuan found Qiu Xingqiao, who had not been as lucky. He had worked the entire morning only to return empty-handed.\nThe two brothers used the penny to buy two meat buns and brought them to Qiu Xingyu. They lied and said that they had already eaten while out, before desperately gulping down cold water to fill their stomachs.\nUnable to bear their hunger, the two boys snuck out of the house again.\nQiu Tong followed them and was surprised to find that they were planning to catch mice in the field. Her heart ached.\nAt the end of the day, they were just six-year-old children who did not even have the basic ability to survive.\nQiu Tong touched her dismally empty pockets as she gazed meaningfully at the two boys. She then left without saying a word.\nThe most pressing matter now was to earn money quickly!\nShe found a clinic on the street and pushed the door open, but there was no one there. She heard movement in the backyard.\nThe boss was preparing lunch and didn’t even look up when he saw someone.\n“It’s lunch break now. Come back at two in the afternoon.”\n“Boss, I’m here to look for a job.”\nQiu Tong was full of confidence. “I know how to treat superficial injuries. I want a part-time job here.”\n“You?”\nThe boss saw that she was young and had patches on her clothes. He could tell from a single glance that she was from a poor family. His eyes flashed with disdain.\n“Don’t come here and cause trouble. I don’t need more workers here!”\n“Boss, I really can do it!”\nIn order to prove her ability, Qiu Tong directly grabbed a fish, which was floating belly-up, from the pond. She pretended to press on a few acupuncture points with her fingers, secretly transferring her power into it.\nThe boss looked at her coldly and was about to chase her away when his eyes widened in shock.\nThe fish, which had been on the verge of death, regained its vitality and started wagging its tail vigorously!",

      "content": "Chapter 7: Miracle Doctor\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\n“You really know how to treat illnesses?”\nThe boss’s eyes were filled with surprise and suspicion. His tone was hesitant. “Healing a person is different from healing a fish. You can’t afford the slightest bit of carelessness.”\nQiu Tong was rather calm. She suggested casually, “If you don’t believe me, you can find a few patients with superficial injuries and let me try.”\n“If I can heal them, I don’t want a basic salary. I want 70% of the treatment fee. And you must pay me at the end of every day.”\n“But I have one condition. No one can see my face.”\nWithout the need to give her a basic salary, it meant that there was no cost to him. And if she succeeded, it would also make his clinic famous.\nThe boss naturally wouldn’t miss such a good opportunity and he immediately signed an agreement with her.\nIn the clinic, he used a curtain to separate out an area, allowing Qiu Tong to treat her patients behind the curtain, while he observed and learned.\nQiu Tong mainly dealt with patients with superficial injuries and bone fractures. Such injuries were quite common and she treated about seven to eight patients in that one afternoon.\nShe borrowed a long needle from the boss in advance and pretended to perform acupuncture or injections on the patients. During the treatments, she slowly infused her superpower into the patient’s body. Bleeding wounds would stop immediately and the pain significantly lessened.\nAfter just half an hour, a group of workers rushed anxiously into the clinic, carrying a stretcher.\n“Doctor, quickly take a look at my brother!”\nThe face of the young man on the stretcher was full of pain. His lips were pale, and there was a metal rod stuck straight into his thigh. Blood gushed out like a fountain from the wound.\nThe boss was so scared that his face turned pale. He immediately wanted to rush over to say that the clinic couldn’t treat him.\nQiu Tong stopped him. “I can treat him.”\nThe boss’s lips were trembling. “This is a human life, it’s not something to play with!”\nWith a faint smile, Qiu Tong asked the workers to turn the stretcher around and move his legs past the curtain.\nLooking at the vicious iron rod and the blood still gushing continuously, it was very likely that the iron rod had pierced a major artery. If the bleeding was not stopped, he would be in danger of falling into shock.\nQiu Tong immediately stuck the long needle into the wound and flicked it with her index finger. She frowned and slowly infused her power.\nThe gushing blood gradually stopped, and the youth’s pale and bruised face slowly regained its color. The pain on his face also eased a lot.\nWith slightly furrowed brows, she gestured for the boss to come over and help her remove the iron rod.\nThe boss’s hands trembled as he braced himself to remove the rod. However, he realized that the patient seemed to be unconscious. In fact, he appeared to be sleeping.\nWith a practiced hand, Qiu Tong skillfully bandaged the wound and had the boss go out to communicate with the other workers. Everything was fine now.\nThe group of workers nearly knelt down before the boss in gratitude. They thought that their brother was going to lose his leg!\nEveryone at present tutted in wonder, praising the progress of this clinic’s medical skills.\nThe boss had never seen such amazing medical skills before. With the casual insertion of a few needles, the gushing blood was immediately stopped. Even the patient’s pain seemed to have eased by quite a bit.\nMiracle doctor, she was simply a miracle doctor!\nIn just two hours, the boss’ initial disdain and suspicion towards Qiu Tong had turned into unrestrained admiration. He even requested her to be his teacher.\nQiu Tong was amused by it but she had to reject him. After all, this was not solely just pure medical skills, but due to her special ability.\nThe boss felt that it was a pity, but he could understand. After all, every physician family had their own rules. In order to win Qiu Tong’s favor and make her stay in his clinic for the long-term, he took the initiative to reduce his share of the treatment fees from 30% to 20%.\nQiu Tong needed the money so she did not refuse.\nWith money came stability and assurance. Furthermore, she still had three little kids to raise.\nIn the middle of the empty yard, a basket was propped up with a wooden stick. There was a rope tied to the wooden stick. The other end of the rope was held by a small hand.\nQiu Xingqiao stared at the basket nervously. When he saw the bird walk to the bottom of the basket, he quickly pulled the rope and the wooden stick with it. With a “clatter”, he managed to trap the bird under the basket.\n“Eldest Brother, I caught a bird!”\nQiu Xingqiao excitedly rushed over and grabbed the bird in his hand, before rushing to look for Eldest Brother.\nThey could have an extra ingredient for dinner tonight! Little Yu had meat to eat now!\nBut when he turned around, he saw a figure stepping in through the door. Qiu Xingqiao was so frightened that his whole body stiffened and his hands lost their grip strength. The bird struggled and flew away.\n“My bird!”\nQiu Xingqiao cried out in defeat. This was a bird that he had spent an entire afternoon before finally catching one.\nHe glared at Qiu Tong angrily, his eyes full of guardedness. “What are you doing here? Haven’t you already left?”\nCould she have changed her mind and decided to come back to torture them?\nHearing the commotion, Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingyu walked out. Qiu Xingyu’s eyes lit up. “Mommy!”\nPanting, Qiu Tong walked into the courtyard carrying a huge bag of items. She then placed it heavily on the ground.\nDewy cabbage, carrots, pork streaked with fat and rice as white as jade pieces…\nThe three brats were stupefied.. It was as if a mountain of treasures descended from the heavens, crashing down upon them until they had lost all sense of direction.",

Qiu Xingqiao, prepare the vegetables. Little Yu, rinse the rice.”\nLittle Yu sweetly assented and was about to go over when she was stopped by Qiu Xingyuan.\n“We won’t eat your food!”\nQiu Xingyuan picked up Little Yu and walked away. Qiu Xingqiao hurriedly followed him and whispered, “Brother, did she bring those things for us to eat?”\nHe suddenly looked horrified. “Could she be trying to poison us?”\n“Will she still be able to sell us if she poisoned us to death?”\nQiu Xingyuan pursed his lips tightly. He also felt that Qiu Tong was harboring evil intentions. There must be some trap.\nQiu Tong was both amused and exasperated when she overheard their whispers. She decided to do everything herself and quickly prepared the ingredients in front of her.\nFood was scarce in the post-apocalyptic era, not to mention fresh vegetables and fruits. Qiu Tong was so moved by the sight of those ingredients that she nearly cried when she was buying them.\nThe aroma of food soon drifted out, making the three brats sitting in the corner feel utterly famished.\n“Brother, I’m so hungry…”\nQiu Xingqiao took a deep breath. Even if he couldn’t eat it, he could still smell it, right?\nAfter cooking for more than an hour, Qiu Tong finally sat down in satisfaction.\nThere were about a dozen dishes on the table, including both meat and vegetables. She also steamed a large pot of fragrant white rice.\nWith a satisfied smile, Qiu Tong glanced at the three little heads. “Come and eat.”\nQiu Xingyuan looked at her coldly. Without his permission, his two younger siblings dared not move.\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes and ignored them. She strode over and sat down, before helping herself generously to the food.\nQiu Xingqiao widened his eyes and swallowed even harder as he watched Qiu Tong eat.\n“How can she eat so much? Is she a pig?”\nQiu Xingyuan’s eyes flickered. Seeing that Qiu Tong was fine after eating the food, he brought Qiu Xingqiao and Qiu Xingyu over slowly.\nSuch a tiny kid, but full of caution and schemes.\nQiu Tong was secretly amused, but her face remained expressionless.\n“Help yourself to the rice. Take as much as you can eat. You must cherish the food and not leave a single grain of rice!”\nShe piled the dishes in front of the triplets and said calmly, “Eat more. Don’t be picky.”\nLooking at the table full of sumptuous dishes, the three children almost thought they were dreaming.\nThey had never eaten so much good food since they were born. Even during the New Year, they only had some salty side dishes and plain, watery porridge.\nIn the past, Qiu Tong would not let them eat at the table. She would just toss them a bowl and let them squat at the corner of the table like animals.\n“Why did you come back?”\nThe guardedness in Qiu Xingyuan’s eyes intensified, as if Qiu Tong was really plotting something. “What exactly are you planning?”\nQiu Tong tapped her index finger on the table, her bright eyes slightly curved. “Because I am regretting it.”\nQiu Xingyuan’s body stiffened, and his eyes darkened gradually.\nIndeed, she was regretting it!\nShe still planned to sell the three of them…\nQiu Xingyuan quietly gritted his teeth and swore that even if he had to go all out, he would never let Qiu Tong sell off his brother and sister.\nJust as he was about to lash out, he heard Qiu Tong say unhurriedly, “I was pregnant for 10 months and walked through the gates of hell three times before giving birth to you three brats.”\n“It wasn’t easy for me to raise you three and if I were to abandon all of you now, it would be my loss.”\nShe clapped her hands together and grinned. “So I’ve decided I’ll keep you all alive until you can survive on your own.”\nQiu Tong raised one finger, laying out her condition so as to lower their suspicions against her.\n“The condition is that you have to repay me by being filial to me when I’m old. If you have no problem with that, come over and eat.”\nIt turned out that she was afraid that no one would support her when she was old!\nHaving finally understood her motive, Qiu Xingyuan’s tense nerves relaxed slightly.\nIt was just a mutually beneficial exchange. Besides, he did not have the ability to support his younger siblings yet. Since Qiu Tong was willing to raise them, that would be for the best.\nQiu Xingyuan glanced at Qiu Tong and said coldly, “Deal.”\nIt was as if to him, it was really just a mutually beneficial exchange.\nWith Qiu Xingyuan’s permission, Qiu Xingqiao and Qiu Xingyu immediately rushed to the table and helped themselves to the food, hurriedly stuffing it into their mouths.\nIn the next second, those two kids widened their eyes in shock when the amazing taste tantalized their taste buds.\nThey had never eaten such delicious food before. It was a hundred times more delicious than meat buns!",

He never knew that this woman could actually cook.\nAmusement flashed across Qiu Tong’s eyes when she saw them eating so happily.\n“As long as you listen to me obediently, you will see better days in the future.”\nQiu Xingyu held her bowl, which was bigger than her own face. “Mommy, will you still sell us when our life gets better?”\nHer gaze was innocent. She had obviously been well protected by Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao.\nQiu Tong pinched her cheeks. “Of course not. You’re already so old. Even if I sell you, you won’t fetch a good price.”\nQiu Tong spoke very seriously. In any case, even if she promised that she would not sell them, Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao might not believe her. She might as well find a reason so that they could remain in peace.\nHowever, Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao looked at each other, their small faces full of worry.\n“Brother, what if someone offers an attractive price? Will she still choose to sell us?”\nQiu Xingqiao’s eyes were filled with doubt as he quietly whispered into Qiu Xingyuan’s ear.\nQiu Xingyuan looked at Qiu Tong coldly and said hatefully, “I will never let her succeed!”\nQiu Tong, “…”\nShe was helpless. These two brats were unmoved by both hard and soft tactics. They were impervious to everything, yet they had so many tricks up their sleeves!\nThe three of them quickly finished all the food. It was mainly because Qiu Tong’s appetite was so big. The three brats were so shocked that they gaped at the sight. Qiu Xingyuan even suspected Qiu Tong of eating the Qiu family into bankruptcy.\nSeeing that it was almost time for her to meet the boss of the clinic, Qiu Tong cleared the dishes and instructed.\n“I’m going out this afternoon. The three of you have to take good care of the house. Do not open the door to strangers, understand?”\nOther than Qiu Xingyu responding to her obediently, Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao stared at her and pursed their lips without saying a word.\nQiu Tong did not expect them to reconcile with her within such a short period of time. Just as she was about to leave, she heard someone calling her.\n“Qiu Tong, what’s wrong with you?”\nA beautiful woman with short braids, a flowery shirt and black pants rushed over and grabbed her. “Why did you suddenly change your mind?”\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes slowly and looked at the woman who was a complete stranger to her. She put up her guard and did not respond.\n“Eldest Brother, that bad woman is here again!”\nQiu Xingqiao’s sharp eyes spotted Lin Shan immediately.\nIt was this woman who kept saying that she was Qiu Tong’s best friend, but encouraged Qiu Tong to sell them off!\nQiu Xingqiao gritted his teeth in anger and rushed out with his head lowered. “I’ll chase her out now!”\nLin Shan’s back was facing Qiu Xingqiao. When she saw Qiu Tong remain silent, her frown deepened. “Why aren’t you saying anything? Are you regretting it now? Qiu Tong, you can’t be soft-hearted at a time like this. As long as you sell them, you’ll be free… Ah!”\nA sudden force from the side made her stumble!\n“Little bastard, are you blind?!”\nLin Shan yelled at the top of her lungs and raised her hand to slap Qiu Xingqiao across the face. It was obvious that she usually hit them.\nThis time, a slender hand grabbed her wrist.\nThere was no emotion in Qiu Tong’s eyes. “He’s just a child. There’s no need to be so serious.”\nLin Shan stared at Qiu Tong as if this was the first time she was seeing her.\nHow could that be?\nShe had hit these little brats often in the past, and Qiu Tong had never stopped her. She would even comment that they deserved it.\n“Qiu Tong, have you really gone soft-hearted?”\nLin Shan grabbed Qiu Tong’s arm and sighed. “But you have to think about yourself. You’re only in your early twenties. How are you going to survive with these three burdens?”\n“I’m your best friend. Why would I harm you?”\nThe woman whispered into Qiu Tong’s ear, “The buyer I introduced to you is offering the highest price. You won’t be making a loss.”\nOnly then did Qiu Tong recall that this was the former Qiu Tong’s “best friend”—Lin Shan!\nAccording to the storyline in the book, Lin Shan was not a good person. Not only did she cheat the former Qiu Tong of all her money, she also instigated her to sell her children. She was a typical “fake sister”.\nShe lowered her eyes, not daring to show too obvious a difference from the former Qiu Tong. She stated indifferently.\n“I have other arrangements.”\nSeeing that she had made up her mind not to sell the children, Lin Shan panicked. She had already accepted the commission fee, and if Qiu Tong went back on her word now, wouldn’t she have to cough the money back out?!",

Little brats, I’ll kill you all!”\nLin Shan’s lips were trembling, and she was so angry that her eyebrows were vertical. She rolled up her sleeves and rushed over, wanting to teach Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao a lesson, but she was stopped by Qiu Tong.\n“Qiu Tong, look at these ingrates. What are you keeping them for?”\nLin Shan glared hatefully at the brats. “We might as well sell them and exchange them for some money!”\n“If you like to sell children so much, why don’t you sell your own children?”\nWith a cold face, Qiu Tong smirked. “Speaking of money… when are you going to return the money you swindled from me?”\n“What… what are you talking about?”\nLin Shan took a step back and looked away guiltily, refusing to admit it. “When did I cheat you of your money?”\nThe smile on Qiu Tong’s face grew colder when she realized that she was denying it.\n“Since you didn’t cheat me, then it’s a loan? When are you going to return the $15,000 you borrowed from me?”\nIn the original novel, it was stated that after the former Qiu Tong’s family assets were seized, she still had some money on her. However, Lin Shan would keep borrowing money from her, until she was all emptied out.\nSeeing that she was really angry, Lin Shan’s expression changed and her tone softened. “Qiu Tong, don’t be angry. Actually, I borrowed money from you for your own good.”\n“Think about it, the Qiu family assets were seized and everything has been confiscated by the police. If they find out that you still have that stash of money, the police will definitely take it away.”\nLin Shan sounded extremely sincere, as if she was genuinely concerned for Qiu Tong. “I am just helping you keep it safe for the time being.”\nAs for whether she would ever return the money to Qiu Tong, Lin Shan did not even consider it. In any case, based on her understanding of Qiu Tong, she would definitely not dare to call the police, so the money would remain in her hands.\nHowever, to Lin Shan’s surprise, Qiu Tong insisted on getting her money back.\n“No need. Give me back my money. I’ll hand it over to the police myself.”\n“Have you gone mad?”\nLin Shan raised her voice and said angrily, “Qiu Tong, don’t you trust me? Well now, we’re best friends but you don’t even trust me…”\nDespite Lin Shan’s reprimand, Qiu Tong insisted, “It’s every citizen’s duty to abide by the law.”\nShe raised her eyebrows, her clear and sharp gaze almost seeing through Lin Shan’s thoughts. She smiled insincerely and said, “You’re not planning to keep it for yourself and not return it to me, are you?”\nAfter having her true motives exposed, Lin Shan now looked miserable. “How is that possible? It’s just that I came out in a hurry today and didn’t bring any money with me.”\n“Wait for me. I’ll go back and bring it to you now.”\nLin Shan ran off without looking back. Qiu Tong watched her leave, the smirk on her face growing wider.\nLin Shan probably wouldn’t dare to come again for the time being.\nBut, no one had ever managed to take anything from her. Even if they did, she would make them pay it back ten times or even a hundred times over!\nShe already had a plan in mind.\nTurning around, Qiu Tong raised her eyebrows in surprise. “Why are you looking at me like that?”\nQiu Xingyuan drew back his conflicted gaze. He did not expect this woman to protect them.\nPreviously, when Lin Shan came, she would either hit or scold them. Meanwhile, this woman would instigate her to beat them even more ruthlessly.\nThis was the first time she had protected them.\nThe three children started to have some tender feelings for Qiu Tong. Even the way they looked at her changed.\nQiu Tong noticed the change in the children’s attitude. Before she could rejoice, a man suddenly appeared at the door.\n“Qiu Tong!”\nHe rushed over aggressively and pointed angrily at Qiu Xingyuan and the rest. “Didn’t you promise me to sell them? Why are they still here?”\nWho was this?\nQiu Tong looked at the handsome but malicious man in front of her and asked coldly, “Why should I sell?”\nThe man thought that Qiu Tong could not bear to part with the children, so he immediately held her hand and said with deep affection, “Qiu Tong, we’ll have our own children in the future. With these three burdens, we won’t be able to have a good life, and my family won’t accept you.”\nHis tone carried a hint of threat. “Don’t you want to marry me?”\nQiu Tong’s heart skipped a beat. So this man was her lover, the scumbag Yu Ge?\nYu Ge was also an expert at swindling money. Later on, he even cheated Qiu Tong of the money from selling her children before dumping her. This was the main cause of Qiu Tong’s change in temperament and poverty.\nQiu Tong retracted her hand and said coldly, “You can’t even accept my children. This means you don’t love me at all. Why should I care if your family can accept me?”\n“Yu Ge, you can’t blame these children for their lack of ability to survive. You’re the useless one!”",

      "content": "Chapter 11: Well Done\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nYu Ge’s face flushed red from humiliation. He glared at Qiu Tong and questioned her, “Are you really not planning to sell these three bastards?”\nHe said vehemently, “Fine! If you don’t agree to sell them today, we’ll break up!”\n“Sure!”\nQiu Tong readily agreed.\nYu Ge was stunned. Qiu Tong smirked, but her smile did not reach her eyes. “Please leave now. We will have nothing to do with each other from now on!”\nYu Ge panicked when he saw that Qiu Tong really wanted to have a clean break from him.\nHe had not extracted every drop of value from Qiu Tong yet, so how could he be willing to let her go?\n“Qiu Tong, don’t be angry. I’m just worried about our future.”\nYu Ge looked troubled. He let out a long sigh. “I didn’t mean to force you to sell your children, but we will have our own children. With them, how can we give our own children the best life?”\n“If you sell them for a sum of money, we can open a grocery store and even build a home. When our own children are born, we can provide them with a good living situation. I will also do my best to take care of you and our children.”\nYu Ge deliberately painted a beautiful future for Qiu Tong. The love in his eyes looked like it was about to overflow. “Qiu Tong, I love you and I can accept everything about you. But we have to consider reality. Sell the children, okay?”\nQiu Tong’s eyes flickered, but she remained silent.\nThe three kids who were eavesdropping at the side were instantly enraged.\nWhen Qiu Tong turned away, Qiu Xingyu took the opportunity. She clasped her hands behind her back. Her large eyes were brimming with tears, making her look extremely pitiful and aggrieved.\n“Uncle, can you not let Mommy sell me?”\nYu Ge’s gaze landed on Qiu Xingyu’s beautiful and adorable face. A strange glint flashed across his eyes. “Little Yu, come here to Uncle.”\nAmong the children, this daughter seemed to be the most valuable.\nIf he could trick her to go outside…\nYu Ge smiled as he waved her over. “Do you want to eat ice cream? Uncle will bring you to buy it, okay?”\nQiu Xingyu ran over affectionately and tugged at his clothes. “I want to eat, but Uncle, my doll fell into the pool. Can you help me get it first?”\nThe direction of the pool was at the back of the courtyard, in a very hidden corner.\nYu Ge seemed to have seen the banknotes waving at him. He looked warily at Qiu Tong’s corner and realized that she was not paying attention to the commotion. He immediately went to hold Xiao Yu’s soft hand.\n“Let’s go then.”\nMoving very nimbly, Qiu Xingyu ran towards the pool. “Uncle, come quickly!”\nShe pointed at the doll in the middle of the pool, her eyes sparkling. “Uncle, it’s over there!”\nYu Ge stuck his head out and looked over. However, he was suddenly kicked hard on the back. With a splash, he fell into the pool!\nQiu Xingyu immediately jumped up and clapped her hands excitedly. “Second Brother, you’re super awesome!”\nQiu Xingqiao lifted his nose proudly and waved his fist at Yu Ge.\nThis person actually dared to instigate Mommy to sell them and even had ulterior motives with Little Yu. Qiu Xingqiao was furious and wished he could teach Yu Ge a lesson.\nAt the same time, a small arm reached over and poured a packet of powder into the pool.\nYu Ge, who was soaking in the pool, immediately had large patches of rashes on his face and body. It was strange and terrifying. He was desperately scratching and shouting, “What did you pour inside?!”\n“It’s just powder that makes the skin extra sensitive.”\nQiu Xingyuan’s eyes darkened, his lips set in a cold line. “Just take it as our gratitude for your ‘care and concern’!”\n“Tsk, well done.”\nAn amused voice came from above.\nThe three children gasped and realized that Qiu Tong was already standing behind them.\nQiu Xingyuan reacted extremely quickly and immediately shielded Qiu Xingqiao and Qiu Xingyu behind him. “It was all done by me. It has nothing to do with the two of them!”\nQiu Tong glanced at him and suddenly raised her hand.\nWas she going to hit him?\nAlthough he had long expected it, Qiu Xingyuan’s heart still turned cold. He gritted his teeth and closed his eyes.\nHowever, it was a gentle touch that reached his head. “This powder is quite effective. You should prepare a few more.”\nQiu Tong praised him with a smile. Qiu Xingyuan was indeed the future drug lord. He already knew how to mix chemicals at such a young age.\nShe used a broom to pull Yu Ge up.\nBeing tricked by the three children in such a wretched manner, Yu Ge was both embarrassed and angry. He gritted his teeth and clenched his fists, wanting to smash it towards Qiu Xingyuan.\n“You three little brats! Bastards! Demons! How dare you trick me!”\nQiu Tong picked up the broom beside her and took the opportunity to give him a good beating.\n“You dare to force me to sell my children? Why don’t you take a good look at yourself in the mirror!”\n“Even if all the men in the world are dead, I won’t fall for you!”\n“Get lost, get lost!”\nCovering his head, Yu Ge was given a thorough thrashing by Qiu Tong.. He ran out of the house in a sorry state. With a face full of rashes, he angrily said, “Qiu Tong, just you wait! You will regret this!”",

      "content": "Chapter 12: Mysterious Man\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nQiu Tong did not take his threat to heart. After successfully chasing him out, the family of four was tired and hungry.\nLooking at the time, it was probably too late to cook.\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes and smiled. “Let’s go. I’m in a good mood today. I’ll bring you guys to eat something good!”\nThe place they lived in was too remote. It would take them a long time to reach the downtown area.\nFortunately, Qiu Tong was not in a hurry. The four of them leisurely walked along the road.\nThe three children had always been focused on survival. They never stopped to take a good look at the scenery around them. Nevertheless, they were also at an age where they were full of curiosity. Along the way, they were extremely curious about all kinds of things.\nAs they passed a remote street, they suddenly heard the chaotic sounds of gunshot.\nTwo groups of people were fighting on the streets. One side was clearly on the losing end. Unable to hold on any longer, they fired two shots at the pursuing enemy, before hurriedly fleeing away.\nThe other side immediately gave chase. Qiu Tong shielded the three children and hid to the side in case they were accidentally injured. The three children hid behind her obediently, revealing only six pairs of eyes as they stared nervously and fearfully at the chaotic street.\nSeeing that they were very anxious, Qiu Tong comforted them. “It’s alright. I’ll protect you.”\nQiu Xingyuan shot her a quick glance, as if he did not believe her.\nAlthough Qiu Tong had changed recently, Qiu Xingyuan still did not dare to let down his guard. He did not forget that Qiu Tong was still the greatest danger.\nWhen all the chaos finally dispelled, Qiu Tong slowly walked out with her children.\nThe originally orderly street had become very messy. There was no one on the road, but only a car knocked to the side. There seemed to be a figure in the back seat.\nQiu Tong frowned and decided to circle around the car and leave.\nShe had three children with her and could not risk meddling in other people’s business. However, when she caught a glimpse of the man’s face in the backseat, Qiu Tong immediately changed her mind.\nThe man’s facial features were unusually deep-set. He had straight eyebrows and well-defined features. His thick eyelashes cast a shadow on his face. Even though he was unconscious, he still looked cold and aloof.\nQiu Tong stared blankly at his face, a sense of familiarity lingering in her heart.\nBut she had never seen this man in her memories.\nWith a glint in her eyes, Qiu Tong asked the three children to hide in a nearby alley. She then moved a nearby bamboo basket and some clothes over to cover them, before saying hurriedly, “Hide here. Don’t move.”\nShe turned back to the place where the gunfight had taken place, only to find that the group of people who had left earlier had returned. They seemed to be planning to take the man away.\nQiu Tong’s eyes turned cold as she charged over and kicked one of the men away.\nWith swift and fierce movements cultivated during her post-apocalyptic days, her body was agile and her attacks clean and direct. Every strike was aimed directly at the vital points. In just a short period of time, none of the group, which comprised over a dozen men, were left standing.\n“Hey, wake up!”\nQiu Tong patted the man’s face and he opened his eyes, staring at her coldly.\nQiu Tong’s body stiffened, and that sense of familiarity welled up in her heart again.\nHowever, the man lost consciousness again.\nOnly then did Qiu Tong notice the gunshot wound on his chest. Her eyes flickered as she leaned forward and a faint white light gradually appeared on her palm.\nThe hideous wound started to heal and Qiu Tong did not notice the flutter of the man’s eyelashes. Still in a blur, his eyes opened just a slit.\nJin Yang didn’t expect the other group to be so bold as to set up a trap and start a gunfight in broad daylight.\nHe tried his best, but there were too many opponents. In the chaos, he was shot in the chest.\nAs much endurance as Jin Yang had, he had lost consciousness from the intense pain.\nAmidst the haze, someone seemed to be calling out to him.\nJin Yang forced his eyes open, only to meet a pair of limpid eyes.\nHe wanted to see more clearly, but his consciousness was once again dragged back into the thick black fog.\nVaguely, he could smell a crisp, clear fragrance, which was not too thick. The pain in his chest seemed to have eased a lot.\nHe kept drifting in and out of consciousness. Jin Yang wanted to open his eyes, but he could only vaguely see a blurry figure, as well as hear her soft and gentle voice.\nThere also seemed to be three chattering children.\nHis chest was getting warmer and Jin Yang could subtly feel that his injuries were getting better.\nBy the time he regained full consciousness, he had been transported to the hospital by his team. The fatal wound on his chest had also recovered.\nHe could not help touching his chest with his long fingers, as if he still remembered the pain of being shot.\nJin Yang’s eyes darkened. Was he dreaming when he saw that woman?",

      "content": "Chapter 13: Your Prize\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nJin Yang called for his comrade who had sent him to the hospital. The other party immediately understood. “You are talking about that young lady with her three children?”\nSo there were really three children.\nJin Yang frowned slightly and gave a small nod. He had his comrade immediately investigate the background of Qiu Tong and those three children.\nHe had vaguely felt that Qiu Tong’s aura was very familiar, as if he had seen her somewhere a long time ago.\nBut no matter what, he could not remember.\nJin Yang’s eyes darkened when he thought of the warm aura that was like the morning sun.\nTaking advantage of the chaos during the gunfight, Qiu Tong took a lot of money from the bad guys and brought the three kids to a restaurant in the city. She slapped the table and said, “Serve us all your signature dishes!”\nThe table, which was large enough to cater to 20 people, was instantly filled. The three children looked shocked.\nWasn’t this too much?\nQiu Tong felt extremely satisfied and gestured to them. “Eat. What are you waiting for?”\nShe quickly lowered her head and started to eat. She ate in a frenzied, but not uncivilized manner. Watching her, Qiu Xingyuan and the rest was once again dumbfounded.\nQiu Xingyu carefully looked at Qiu Tong’s bag, her eyes filled with sorrow.\nMommy was such a glutton and they didn’t have much money on them. Would she eat them into poverty?\n“We are not eating.”\nQiu Xingyuan shook his head guardedly. With so many dishes and the expensive look of the restaurant, the prices should be very high.\nIf they spent all their money, Qiu Tong would definitely use that as an excuse to throw a tantrum.\nQiu Tong looked in confusion at the three children huddled in a corner. “Why aren’t you eating?”\nQiu Xingyu bit her finger and looked longingly at the exquisite dishes on the table. She whispered, “We won’t have any money left if we eat.”\nWhat reason was that?\nQiu Tong was amused and said casually, “I have money to pay for this.”\n“Besides, you can always earn more money when you run out of it, but you cannot go hungry.”\nShe made the three children come to the table and instructed them carefully, “But don’t ever waste food.”\nThe three children were thrifty by nature and nodded obediently. They felt that Qiu Tong had really changed a lot.\nIn the past, when she had no money, Qiu Tong would scold the heavens for being blind. She would go on a tirade about men, before beating them and scolding them for being money-sucking burdens.\nThey had never seen Qiu Tong so optimistic. In the past, Qiu Tong was always full of complaints, and would even hit them when she was angry.\nAfter eating and drinking, Qiu Tong was in no hurry to bring them back.\nThe three children usually stayed at home and did not go anywhere. Qiu Tong planned to bring them around. As expected, the three children were full of energy and looked at everything in town with fresh eyes.\n“Wow!”\nQiu Xingyu’s sharp eyes caught sight of a doll arranged behind a display window by the street. Her eyes immediately lit up and she pressed her hands against the glass without blinking.\nQiu Tong came up behind her and raised an eyebrow. “You like it?”\nQiu Xingyu nodded vigorously and looked at Qiu Tong expectantly.\nWhen she saw the price in the window, Qiu Tong’s expression changed.\nThis little toy that could not be eaten was actually several times more expensive than the food she had just eaten?!\nQiu Tong didn’t think it was worth it, so she grabbed Qiu Xingyu’s hand and turned to leave.\nAlthough Qiu Xingyu was reluctant, she understood the situation at home and followed obediently. She turned back to look at the doll several times, her eyes filled with longing.\nQiu Xingyuan’s heart ached as he watched. He was also a little angry.\nQiu Tong was willing to spend so much money on a full table of food just to fill her stomach, but she was unwilling to buy Little Yu a doll which she liked so much!\nQuietly clenching his fists, Qiu Xingyuan took a good look at the doll in the display window, carefully noting down the price.\nWhen he had money in the future, he would definitely buy this doll for Little Yu!\nAnd he had to buy two. He would put the other one in Qiu Tong’s room for her to see!\nThey thought that Qiu Tong was going to bring them home, but she led them to a stall which gave prizes for shooting at the balloons.\nWhat was she doing?\nQiu Xingyuan frowned. He realized that he could not understand Qiu Tong anymore.\nPretending not to notice the three kids’ confusion, Qiu Tong walked straight to the boss. “How much?”\n“$20 for 30 shots.”\nQiu Tong pointed at the doll placed on the highest shelf. “That’s the prize for hitting all the balloons?”\nThat doll was more than twice the size of the one in the earlier display window.\nThe boss looked at her and instantly took her for a fool. He chuckled.\n“Yes, you can have it as long as you hit all the balloons.”\nDid she really think that she would be able to hit all the balloons?\nQiu Tong understood and waved at Qiu Xingyu with a smile. “Come here, I’ll help you get a doll!”\nThis time, the boss was not the only one who believed that Qiu Tong must be dreaming. Even Qiu Xingyuan thought so.\nQiu Xingyu walked over doubtfully, but was immediately pulled into Qiu Tong’s arms. Qiu Tong placed Qiu Xingyu’s index finger on the trigger.. “Aim properly.”",

Thereafter, she continued to pull the trigger with Qiu Xingyu, taking aim at the balloons which were 10 meters away. In less than 10 minutes, they popped all 30 balloons.\nGasp after gasp rang out.\nNo one expected Qiu Tong to actually hit the targets and win the biggest prize.\nThe boss’ face turned pallid. If he had known earlier, he wouldn’t have allowed them to play!\nQiu Tong handed the huge doll to the excited Qiu Xingyu. “Your prize.”\nQiu Xingyu hugged her doll excitedly and looked at Qiu Tong with admiration. “Mommy, you’re amazing!”\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao were filled with disdain when they saw Qiu Xingqiao so easily won over by a doll.\n“It’s just a game. What’s the big deal?”\n“That’s right. If you want, I can help you win it too!”\nEven as they spoke those words, Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao were also very shocked. They had no idea that Qiu Tong knew how to use a gun, and that her marksmanship was so accurate.\nAs if she could see through the two boys’ tough exteriors, Qiu Tong smiled at them. “Do you want to learn?”\nQiu Xingqiao’s eyes flickered. He stole a glance at his elder brother’s expression before lying. “That’s such a basic thing. I don’t want to learn it!”\nQiu Xingyuan did not speak. His silence expressed his refusal, but his eyes would occasionally shift toward the gun.\nQiu Tong did not miss the desire in their eyes. She smiled to herself and said enticingly, “Do you really not want to learn?”\n“After learning it, you can protect your little sister and even continue to win her dolls.”\n“Just nod your heads if you want that.”\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao looked at each other. Qiu Xingqiao pretended to show great reluctance. “Since you want to teach us so badly, we have no choice but to agree.”\nQiu Tong nearly laughed out loud at his impertinent act.\nNevertheless, things were progressing as Qiu Tong hoped. This was the first step to her successfully subduing these devilish brats!\nThe next day, Qiu Tong summoned the three brats early in the morning and told them to run 10 rounds around the house. This was in accordance with the training method in the post-apocalyptic world.\nThe three brats did not know what she was up to and had no choice but to follow her instructions. Although they often did manual labor, they did not usually expend so much energy all at once.\nWhen the three children came back panting, they discovered that it was just a warm-up?!\n“Next is sit-ups.”\nSeeing that the three children did not understand, Qiu Tong quickly gave them a demonstration and said in a mild tone, “Since you guys have just started this training, you don’t have to do too many, just fifty will do.”\nHowever, they only managed to do a dozen or so before they were completely unable to take it anymore. Qiu Xingyu was so tired that she collapsed onto the ground.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao quietly gritted their teeth when they saw Qiu Tong drinking her fruit juice with a relaxed expression, as if she was enjoying the sight of their torment.\nThis woman must be going crazy again. She was deliberately messing with them!\nQiu Xingqiao jumped up angrily and glared at Qiu Tong. “Why aren’t you training?”\nBesides, they had never seen Qiu Tong train before. She claimed that this was useful for learning to shoot. It was most likely a lie!\n“Because I’m stronger than you!”\nQiu Tong replied leisurely. Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao looked unconvinced. “How do you know? Perhaps we are more powerful than you!”\nQiu Tong’s interest was piqued. She raised her eyebrows. “Are you challenging me?”\nThe two little men gritted their teeth and nodded vigorously.\n“Yes!”\nQiu Tong accepted the challenge readily. She did not look down on them just because they were children. “You two can come at me together.”\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao looked at each other. With tacit cooperation cultivated over their many years together, they charged at Qiu Tong together, one attacking her neck while the other attacked her legs.\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes as she inwardly admired their strategy.\nAs expected of the biggest villains in the future, they were so talented in fighting. They were able to quickly detect the vulnerable parts of humans.\nUnfortunately, their opponent today was Qiu Tong.\nShifting one foot behind, Qiu Tong dodged and leaped at the two little ones and pinned them to the ground.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao were conquered, their clothes and faces covered in dust.\n“Are you convinced now?”\nQiu Tong let them go. Seeing that it was almost noon, she said, “You guys continue, I’ll go and make lunch.”\nQiu Xingyuan helped Qiu Xingqiao up from the ground. When they thought of the mission Qiu Tong had assigned them, they all felt a headache coming.\n“Brother, is she just purposely tormenting us?”\nQiu Xingqiao grimaced and sat on the ground. He felt like it would be a long time before he could stand up again.\nQiu Xingyuan also frowned. He felt that Qiu Tong must be feeling too bored and restless now. “She has her full attention on us now. Who else can she torture but us?”\n“Brother, why don’t we find her a man? She’s so restless now, she must be lacking a man!”\nQiu Xingqiao’s eyes lit up, and he suggested, “I heard from Brother Hu Zi and the rest that the moment this woman gets caught up in a romance, she won’t be able to think about anything else.”\nThis way, Qiu Tong wouldn’t keep tormenting them anymore!\nQiu Xingyuan considered this and felt that it seemed to be a good solution.",

She had just finished cooking when the three brats pulled her out with mysterious expressions on their faces. They refused to tell her what they were going to do.\n“You’ll know when we get there.”\nAfter walking for more than 10 minutes. Qiu Xingyuan surveyed the surroundings and said in a casual tone, “We are here.”\nWhat was so special about this place?\nQiu Tong frowned. Suddenly, a man leaned over. “Beauty, where are you from?”\nAnother short, fat man squeezed over. “You look familiar. Have I seen you from somewhere before?”\n“Can you respect the queue? First come, first served?”\n“This kind of matter depends on fate. What has it got to do with first come, first served…”\nSpeechless, Qiu Tong watched the two men argue with each other. She felt increasingly puzzled.\nThey were at a corner of the city park. It was a rather secluded area and there were about 20 to three men and women gathered here.\nThere were more men, but they were generally average-looking. Most of them were probably office workers.\nThere were fewer women, and there were also two or three couples talking together.\nQiu Tong edged over and realized that they were describing their family background and personal details. This was obviously a matchmaking corner!\nShe cursed under her breath and was about to turn around to find those brats and settle the score with them, when someone blocked her way.\n“Hello, pretty lady. I already noticed you just now.”\nThe newcomer had average looks but his smile was especially confident. “Are those three children yours?”\nQiu Tong nodded perfunctorily, but the man appeared a little disappointed. “So it’s a second marriage…”\nBut looking at Qiu Tong’s beautiful face with appreciation, he said, “Although you have three children, I have a good feeling about you. Why don’t we get to know each other first?”\n“My family background is not bad. I am definitely a worthy match to you, but I have to say this first. After we get married, we have to have our own children…”\nQiu Tong laughed at his confident and conceited tone. “I’m sorry, I’m not looking for a partner.”\n“Why did you come to a matchmaking corner then? Are you trying to cheat people?”\nA trace of anger flashed across the man’s face. He raised his hand to grab Qiu Tong. “You’re not allowed to leave. You have to explain yourself!”\nHe even wanted to take advantage of this situation to grope Qiu Tong’s chest.\nQiu Tong’s eyes turned cold. She lifted her leg and kicked the man’s crotch, teaching him a vicious lesson.\nShe turned around and found that the three kids had already run away.\nVery good, they dared to scheme against her!\nShe made a note on her mental scorecard against those three brats, but Qiu Tong found that the house was empty when she returned.\nWhere were they?\nQiu Tong looked around but did not find anyone. She happened to see her neighbor. “Have you seen my three children?”\nThe neighbor looked at her strangely, as if she was very surprised. “You are actually looking for your children?”\nQiu Tong pursed her lips and remained silent. The neighbor pursed her lips in disdain and gloated.\n“It’s too late for you to care about them now. Your second son went to find someone to fight with. And your eldest son is probably bringing your daughter to the internet cafe.”\nThe Qiu family was full of weirdos. The neighbor left hurriedly for fear of being tainted by anything to do with the Qiu family.\nQiu Tong did not pay attention to the neighbor’s attitude. She followed the direction pointed out to her and found the nearest internet cafe. But she still could not find Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingyu.\nCould something have happened?\nQiu Tong panicked and was about to look elsewhere when she passed by a bookstore at the back of the internet cafe. Swas shocked to find Qiu Xingyuan squatting on the ground.\nHe was engrossed in a book with his back facing her.\nQiu Tong walked in and realized that he was looking at high school chemistry. He was only six years old!\nQiu Tong turned around and saw Qiu Xingyu staring at the computer screen nervously.\nQiu Tong, “…”\nWas this the greatness of destiny? They were so young but the foundations for being the biggest drug lord and top hacker in the future were already being laid?\nShe was still deep in thought when she heard a harsh shout. “How long are you planning to loiter around here?”\nThe shop owner walked over impatiently and chased them out in disdain. “Go, go, go! You come here for free every time. We’re closing the shop. Hurry up and leave!”\n“Just a little longer. I’ll be done soon.”\nQiu Xingyu pleaded pitifully. She was only a few steps away from completing her code. She just needed a little more time.\n“It’s the two of you again! Don’t come here if you don’t have money. I wonder which family you are from. You are truly shameless, hogging the computer all day long. Do you have any manners at all…”\nThe shopkeeper’s words became increasingly insulting. Qiu Xingyu was just a child and her eyes slowly turned red.\nQiu Tong’s heart ached at the sight and she immediately stepped out with a cold face. “Shut up!”",

      "content": "Chapter 16: Settling A Debt\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nHer eyes were cold, and because of her anger, she was filled with a murderous aura. She looked like someone not to be trifled with.\nThe boss was startled by her. He looked suspiciously at her. “Who are you?”\n“I’m their mother.”\nQiu Tong shielded Little Yu behind her. Little Yu glanced timidly at her face and hung her head gloomily, as if she had committed a grave crime.\n“Do you know how to discipline your child? She’s so young but already knows how to take advantage of others. What are you teaching her…”\nThe boss was furious and scolded Qiu Tong as well after knowing who she was. “What kind of child is that? What kind of parent are you?! Your child is the one who did wrong. How dare you behave so aggressively?”\n“What wrong did she commit?”\nQiu Tong asked coldly. The boss pointed at the computer and said angrily, “She comes here every day to take advantage of the internet and hog public resources. Shame on her!”\n“Sorry, Mommy.”\nQiu Xingyu clutched the corner of Qiu Tong’s clothes tightly, her eyes filled with fear. She felt that she had embarrassed Qiu Tong.\nTears welled in her eyes. “I’ll never come here again,” she added nervously.\nQiu Tong stroked her head and glared at the boss again. She smirked and said, “Since it’s a public resource, what’s wrong with her using it? The computer is out there. Isn’t it for people to use?”\n“Since you can’t bear to let anyone use it, why don’t you just lock it up in a safe?”\n“Why are you so unreasonable?”\nThe boss did not know how to refute Qiu Tong. Seeing that the mother and daughter were about to leave, he immediately stopped them. “Don’t go! Your child was hogging public resources and made me lose many customers! Pay up!”\nQiu Tong paused and looked at him expressionlessly. “How much?”\nThe boss looked at the shabby clothes on them in disdain and said in scornfully, “$80! Look at your pathetic state. Can you afford to pay?!”\nSmack!\nA stack of cash was thrown down in front of the boss.\nQiu Tong said calmly, “Here’s $200.”\nThe boss looked at her doubtfully and counted the bills. It was indeed $200!\nA smile blossomed on his face, and even his attitude towards Qiu Tong and Qiu Xingyu turned exceptionally warm. “We are just a small business, I hope you understand. Come over whenever you have time, I’ll reserve the computer for you!”\nQiu Tong ignored his solicitousness and just scooped up Qiu Xingyu. She turned around and saw Qiu Xingyuan looking at her with a complicated expression.\n“Let’s go.”\nShe went forward and pulled Qiu Xingyuan to her side. This time, he followed beside her obediently and did not try to struggle away.\nWalking out of the bookstore, Qiu Tong looked at Qiu Xingyu seriously and promised, “Little Yu, I’ll buy you a computer as soon as possible. In the future, you won’t have to come all the way here just to use the internet.”\nShe lowered her head and looked at Qiu Xingyuan, who had kept silent the entire time. “Also, tell me what you want for your chemistry studies. I’ll arrange everything for you.”\nSince the two children were destined to have the same talents as during her previous life, she would fully support them and guide them on a completely different path.\nQiu Xingyu’s eyes lit up. “Really? Mommy, you’re the best!”\nQiu Tong was amused by the look of admiration in her eyes. She put her daughter down to let them both walk alongside her. Together, they went to find Qiu Xingqiao.\nQiu Xingyu excitedly shared with her brother the type of computer she wanted to buy. Qiu Xingyuan pursed his thin lips, his eyes flickering with doubt and disbelief.\n“Little Yu, she was just making a casual remark. Don’t get your hopes up.”\nThe excitement on Qiu Xingyu’s face slowly faded as she mumbled, “No, Mommy said she would buy it.”\nQiu Xingyuan’s gaze was cold as he smirked sarcastically. “Is she rich?”\nQiu Xingyu hesitated for a moment. Pain flashed across her eyes. Her mommy had just spent $200!\nQiu Tong, who was walking in front, heard the whispers of the two little kids. A sense of helpless frustration flashed across her eyes.\nFinding an opportunity to earn money was indeed their top priority now. Once she had money, she would buy them what they needed.\nIn the end, Qiu Tong found Qiu Xingqiao in an inconspicuous alley. He was in a fight with someone else.\nShe narrowed her eyes and observed for a while, before raising her eyebrows in surprise.\nAlthough Qiu Xingqiao’s combat ability was not as good as hers, he could already completely subdue a gangster in his teens.\nAfter successfully beating him up and seeing his opponent run away, Qiu Xingqiao walked back with a smug look on his face. When he passed Qiu Tong, he even shot her a menacing look.\nQiu Tong, “…”\nQiu Tong felt a throbbing pain in her forehead. The weight on her shoulders felt as heavy as Mount Tai.\nThere was still a long way to go before she could properly train these three brats and lead them to the righteous path!\nAfter bringing the three children home safely, Qiu Tong squatted down and instructed them seriously, “I have something to do, don’t fool around outside.”\nShe looked at Qiu Xingyuan and said in a soft voice, “You’re the eldest brother, you have to take good care of your younger siblings.”\nQiu Xingyuan looked at her impassively, as if there was no need for her to give him such instructions.\nQiu Tong was amused. She patted his head and headed for the nearby internet cafe.\nShe needed money to support her children. She had to make Lin Shan cough up the money as soon as possible!",

      "content": "Chapter 17: $15,000\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nShe chose a computer at random and found Lin Shan’s social contacts from her hand phone. She messaged Lin Shan on a social messaging platform.\n“When are you returning my money?”\nHer fingers flew nimbly across the keyboard. Through this platform, she could see that Lin Shan had read her message.\nQiu Tong smirked and quickly sent another message. “If you don’t return my money, I’ll call the police!”\nThis time, Lin Shan replied very quickly.\n“Qiu Tong, we’ve been like sisters for so many years. Is our friendship worth less than a mere $15,000? You’re making me sad.”\nQiu Tong slowly narrowed her eyes. Lin Shan saw that she was keeping silent and thought that playing the emotional card was effective. She started to recall the past memories.\nAs Qiu Tong pretended to chat with her, she took the opportunity to hack into Lin Shan’s social media account. She managed to dig out quite a lot of shocking content.\nThere were quite a few photos of her being intimate with all kinds of men. Qiu Tong quickly copied the photos and saved them. After determining Lin Shan’s current location, she stood up and left the internet cafe.\nShe went straight to Lin Shan’s apartment and called her.\nLin Shan picked it up quickly and asked, “Qiu Tong, I’ve sent you so many messages, why didn’t you reply? Did you really call the police?!”\n“I’m downstairs at your house.”\nQiu Tong ignored her questions and just replied with a cold statement. Lin Shan immediately fell silent and hung up.\nIn less than five minutes, Lin Shan rushed out of the corridor.\n“Qiu Tong, must you be so ruthless?”\nLin Shan really didn’t expect Qiu Tong to find this place. She lowered her voice and behaved in a secretive manner, as if she was afraid of something.\nQiu Tong knew what she was worried about, so she decided to block her at the door. She casually glanced at a window on the fifth floor and said, “Aren’t you going to invite me up for a cup of tea?”\nLin Shan froze, her face turning pale. After a while, she said awkwardly, “It’s not convenient.”\nIt hadn’t been easy for her to get close to a rich old man, and he was very generous. Plied by her feminine wiles, the man soon succumbed to her. Not only were they living together now, they were also planning to get married.\nAt this critical juncture, if Qiu Tong were to expose her true colors and went up to quarrel with her, all her efforts would be for naught.\nShe lowered her voice and pleaded, “Qiu Tong, you go back first. We’ve been like sisters for so many years. Don’t you trust me? I’m planning to get married soon. There are too many things going on and I can’t transfer the funds.”\n“When I have money, I will return it to you immediately.”\nQiu Tong did not believe Lin Shan at all.\n“Since you don’t have money, you can ask your boyfriend to pay it back for you.”\nQiu Tong smirked and threatened, “And if you’re too embarrassed to ask, I’ll ask on your behalf.”\nSeeing that she really meant to go upstairs, Lin Shan hurriedly stopped her. Her expression turned extremely ugly. “It’s just $15,000 right? I’ll transfer it to you right now!”\nLin Shan took out her phone and said sarcastically, “Just a mere $15,000 and you are behaving like I am trying to take your life. Qiu Tong, you deserve to be poor and be stuck in the slums forever!”\nAfter transferring the $15,000 to Qiu Tong, Lin Shan’s eyes flashed with a hint of heartache. She then glared at Qiu Tong hatefully. “Qiu Tong, we are no longer sisters from now on! I’ve finally seen your true colors!”\n“Get lost now!”\nQiu Tong was unperturbed. She turned around and sent Lin Shan’s scandalous photos to the old man’s phone before leaving.\nWith $15,000 on her, the first thing Qiu Tong did was to bring the three children to buy the promised items.\nWhen they stood in the mall, the three kids thought they were dreaming.\n“Mommy, can I really buy it?”\nQiu Xingyu looked at the computer on the display booth, her eyes flashing with desire and disbelief.\nQiu Tong smiled. “Which one do you want?”\nQiu Xingyu let out an excited shriek and immediately picked a computer that was the most value for money.\nQiu Tong did not discriminate against Qiu Xingyuan either. She purchased a large number of chemistry tools for Qiu Xingyuan, as well as direct access to the university’s chemistry learning materials. She also bought wooden stakes and punching bags for Qiu Xingqiao.\nThe three brats felt rather light-headed when they received the gifts. They hoped that this beautiful dream would never end.\nQiu Xingyu looked at Qiu Tong, who was following behind them. She covered her mouth as she quietly approached her eldest brother and second brother.\n“Mommy seems to have really become nicer.”\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao looked at each other. They pursed their lips and did not speak.. No one knew what they were thinking.",

      "content": "Chapter 18: Boxing Competition\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nOn the way home, Qiu Tong found a large group of people surrounding the noticeboard, discussing something.\nShe also went to look and saw that it was an announcement for a heavyweight boxing match. The champion’s prize money would be as high as $30,000!\nWasn’t this the perfect opportunity? She needed to earn money and here was the perfect opportunity served to her on a silver platter!\nFighting was her specialty!\nQiu Tong’s interest was piqued. She immediately went to the registration address and filled out the registration form.\nThe staff looked at her thin arms and the three children following behind her. He reminded her tactfully, “Madam, the boxing match is not that simple. You need to win against other competitors who might be of a higher level than you in the preliminary round first. You have three children and should consider your personal safety…”\nQiu Tong nodded her head nonchalantly and quietly warmed up her limbs. She stared at the stage with fervent eyes, already somewhat impatient.\nQiu Xingyuan’s face darkened.\nThis woman was willing to sacrifice her life for the sake of earning money?!\nThe three children looked at the gifts in their hands and their hearts instantly felt heavy. Their eyes were filled with guilt.\nQiu Xingyuan gripped the books and materials in his hands tightly. He suddenly gave Qiu Tong a forceful tug. “Don’t go!”\nSurprised, Qiu Tong looked at Qiu Xingyuan’s awkward expression. He said softly, “I’m still young and don’t really need these chemistry tools and books. Why don’t we return them…”\nQiu Xingqiao and Qiu Xingyu also said that they did not like boxing and surfing the internet. They did not need these things.\nHowever, Qiu Tong firmly rejected them. “Since you have talents in these areas, study hard! Don’t worry about money.”\nQiu Tong took off her jacket, revealing her slender body. Her eyes lit up and a confident smile appeared on her face. “Remember to cheer me on from below the stage!”\nJust as she stood on stage, the audience started booing.\n“Such a young lady. What are you doing here?”\n“That’s right. Going on stage just to embarrass yourself. Get lost!”\nIgnoring the boos below the stage, Qiu Tong circled her wrists. Her opponent was a 1.9-meter tall muscular man. His muscles gleamed as he advised her in a low and muffled voice.\n“I’ll hit hard. You better go down yourself!”\nQiu Tong just smiled at him. The moment the bell rang, she moved!\nShe was extremely fast, and in the blink of an eye, she was already behind the man. She grabbed the man’s shoulders and slammed her heels against the ground, twisting around with great force!\nBang!\nThe sound of his body crashing onto the stage floor stunned the audience.\nIt was a clean shoulder throw which had everyone instantly dumbstruck.\nThe boxer crawled up from the ground in a sorry state, no longer daring to look down on Qiu Tong. However, Qiu Tong’s next attack made the audience gasp in disbelief.\nThis woman was too strong!\nIn just half an hour, Qiu Tong passed the preliminary round, having won every single fight.\nHolding her notice for the next round, Qiu Tong jumped off the stage and raised her eyebrows at the three stunned children.\n“Let’s go!”\nThe three children, “…”\n…\nAt Lin Shan’s residence.\nThe phone was slammed onto the coffee table. The old man, Mr. Cui, pointed at a series of unsightly photos on the screen, trembling in anger.\n“Explain yourself! Didn’t you say that I was the only one?!”\nIt turned out that she was lying!\nLin Shan lowered her head and kept crying, not daring to speak.\nMr. Cui was so angry that he picked up his jacket and walked out. Lin Shan’s heart skipped a beat, and she rushed over to hug his waist tightly. “Don’t go! That was all because I was young and ignorant. I’m sorry! After we got together, I really only had you!”\n“We’re about to get married. If this gets out, won’t I become the laughingstock of everyone?”\nMr. Cui’s face was dark as he kept silent after that.\nLin Shan was nervous. In order to please him, she carefully suggested, “Didn’t you want to buy Qiu Tong’s children? I’ll help you!”\nSeeing Mr. Cui’s disbelief, Lin Shan quickly said, “Although I failed the previous time, I’m still her best friend. She’ll definitely trust me! Don’t worry, I’ll definitely succeed.”\nSeeing that she seemed to be very confident, Mr. Cui finally calmed down and sat down on the sofa. But he refused to even glance at Lin Shan.\nLin Shan solicitously brought him a glass of water and asked, “Who wants Qiu Tong’s children so badly? They’re just three burdens.”\nMr. Cui glared at her warningly. “Don’t be so nosy!”\n“Anyway, you just need to know that the status of that person is not something which you should even dare to think about!”",

      "content": "Chapter 19: Coming For The Kids\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nQiu Tong squatted in front of her house and looked at the dirty water on the ground, deep in thought.\nPrize money from winning boxing competitions could only stem her money problems for the short term. It would be impossible to become rich via this route.\nStaying long-term in the slums with three children was not an option either.\nSecurity in the slums was poor, and the environment was rather harsh and cruel. The educational resources were also not as abundant as those in the city. She had to find a way to move the three children to the city.\nIf she did not remember wrongly, after this period of time, the property prices would skyrocket. She might as well get a small house now. Firstly, it would solve the problem of accommodation, and secondly, it would be a small investment.\nHaving made her decision, she called the three children over and announced in all seriousness, “I’m going to buy a house.”\nQiu Xingyu looked at her with admiration, while Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao looked at her like she must be “daydreaming”.\nQiu Tong had not told them that Lin Shan had returned $15,000, which could be used to make a down payment. She could then take a bank loan for the rest of the amount, and then slowly repay the loan.\nAfter assuring them that she was not daydreaming, she went online to pick an apartment building with comprehensive facilities and a decent education environment. She then brought the three children to choose an apartment.\nJust as they reached a traffic intersection, several people rushed over and immediately surrounded Qiu Tong and her children.\n“Are you Qiu Tong?”\nThe leader was a fat man who had a dragon tattooed on his left arm and wearing a black short-sleeved shirt. He glared at her fiercely before turning his cold eyes to the three children behind her. “Your father cheated us of our money! You have to return the money to us!”\nHe was extorting money from her without even offering any evidence?\nQiu Tong gave him a cold look. “He was the one who cheated you. Go look for him. Why should I pay you?”\n“Children must repay their father’s debt!”\nThe fatty said angrily, “Your father has been arrested and you’re his daughter. You have to pay for him!”\nHe signaled with his eyes, and the others approached slowly with malevolence. “I heard that you have $15,000 in your hands. Since you have money, you need to repay his debts. Otherwise, don’t even think about leaving here today!”\nQiu Tong looked at them impassively and pushed the three uneasy children aside to avoid hurting them.\n“What’s going on?”\nLin Shan suddenly appeared at the entrance of the street. A scheming look flashed across her eyes as she grabbed Qiu Tong. “Qiu Tong, you owe them money?”\n“What her father owes is what she owes!”\nThe fat man and Lin Shan exchanged a look before snorting impatiently. His sinister eyes stared coldly at Qiu Tong. “If you don’t return the money, don’t blame us for being merciless!”\n“Sir, don’t be angry.”\nLin Shan stood protectively in front of Qiu Tong, her eyes filled with righteous loyalty. “How much does she owe you? I’ll help her pay it back!”\n“$15,000!”\nWithout hesitation, Lin Shan transferred $15,000 to the fat man right before Qiu Tong’s eyes. The men finally left after that.\nShe glared at Qiu Tong and said indignantly, “I treat you as a true friend but look at how you treat me in return. For the sake of a little bit of money, you don’t even care about our friendship.”\nShe let out a long sigh and said emphatically, “Take that $15,000 as a loan from me to you.”\nLin Shan glanced at Qiu Tong and said understandingly, “I know you don’t have the ability to pay me back now…”\nShe pretended to glance nonchalantly at the three children behind Qiu Tong. Lin Shan suggested, “The three of them are all grown up now, so they can do some manual labor. Why don’t you leave them to me and let them work to repay their debts first?”\nSo she was here for the children!\nA cold smile flashed across Qiu Tong’s eyes. She knew very well what kind of person Lin Shan was. She was probably the one who hired those men to put up this entire act.\nBut Lin Shan didn’t have the guts to orchestrate something like that alone. There was probably someone else behind her!\n“Sure!”\nQiu Tong agreed readily and looked at Lin Shan from the corner of her eyes. “However, you probably don’t have any jobs to offer them, right? Who are you going to hand them over to?”\n“Have him personally come talk to me.”\n“I will agree if the price is suitable.”\nThe three children’s hearts sank with Qiu Tong’s every word.\nThey thought that Qiu Tong had changed, but in the end, she had not changed at all. She still wanted to sell them out!\nQiu Xingyuan clenched his fists and pursed his thin lips tightly, hatred flashing in his eyes. Qiu Xingqiao’s little face flushed red, and he wished he could immediately rush over and fight Qiu Tong to the death.. Meanwhile, Qiu Xingyu’s eyes were red, and tears kept welling up in them.",

I can’t bear to let them do manual labor either. Why don’t we just forget it.”\n“Don’t!”\nSeeing that Qiu Tong was about to change her mind, Lin Shan hurriedly said, “Actually, I lied to you just now.”\nShe pretended to hold Qiu Tong’s hand with a look of helplessness and sympathy. “They’re your children, how could I bear to let them do hard labor? Let me tell you the truth, it’s Mr. Cui who wants the children. He’s old and doesn’t have children, so he wants to adopt them.”\nLin Shan’s tone was alluring as she slowly nudged Qiu Tong into agreeing. “Think about it, you would be allowing these three children to live a good life by sending them over. Once Mr. Cui dies, won’t all his assets belong to them?”\n“By then, they would bring you over to live with them. Wouldn’t that be the best of both worlds?”\nQiu Tong listened quietly with lowered eyes, waiting for her to finish her little speech. A moment later, she smiled. “So it’s Mr. Cui.”\nAfter successfully obtaining the information she wanted, Qiu Tong was about to leave with the three children when Lin Shan hurriedly pulled her back.\n“Qiu Tong, what do you mean by that?”\n“Tell Mr. Cui that hankering after the children of others because he can’t have children himself—he deserves to die without anyone to send him off to the netherworld.”\nQiu Tong stared at Lin Shan coldly. Her lips curved up in a mocking smile. “Since you care so much, why don’t you just go over and be his daughter?”\n“You!”\nLin Shan’s face flushed red. She finally realized that Qiu Tong was purposely playing her for a fool. Her face fell.\n“If you don’t agree, you must give me back my $15,000 now!”\nShe pulled Qiu Tong back to try and force her to return the money. Qiu Tong raised an eyebrow and said, “I can pay you back, but I have to call the police first!”\n“That bunch of people just now claimed that they were owed money without providing any evidence. You gave them the money before I managed to get to the bottom of things.”\n“I want the police to investigate and see if there’s really any debt.”\nSeeing that Qiu Tong was really going to call the police, Lin Shan panicked.\nHow did that idiot Qiu Tong suddenly become so shrewd?!\nShe did not dare to let Qiu Tong call the police. She was worried it would be discovered that she had been the one who arranged for those men. She forced an awkward smile.\n“Never mind. Those men shouldn’t have gone far. I’ll go find them and get my money back.”\nLooking at Lin Shan’s pathetic back profile, Qiu Tong sneered and narrowed her eyes. She then looked away and continued to lead the three children to choose their house.\nAfter looking at and comparing several places, she finally found a two-bedroom suite and paid the deposit.\n“In the future, this room will belong to the two boys. Little Yu and I will stay in the other room.”\nQiu Tong looked very satisfied after assigning the rooms. Although the house was not too big, it was much bigger than the small, dilapidated hut in the slums.\nHowever, the three children looked troubled and did not look happy at all.\n“What’s the matter?”\nSensing that there was something wrong, Qiu Tong touched Qiu Xingyuan’s head, but he avoided her.\nQiu Xingyuan looked at her coldly and pursed his thin lips. “Why are you still selling us? Is it because you need money to buy a house?”\nHe gave a small, cold smile and clenched his fists tightly.\n“Will you still sell us off in future, as and when you need money to buy things?”\nQiu Tong looked at him in astonishment. She then looked at Qiu Xingqiao and Qiu Xingyu, who also had cold and guarded expressions on their faces. She suddenly felt very exasperated.\n“I’m not planning to sell you guys. I was tricking her to try and get information out of her.”\nQiu Tong denied it, but the three children remained unconvinced.\n“If I really wanted to sell you guys, I would have done so long ago,” she said in frustration.\n“Don’t worry, I’m still waiting for you to support me in my old age. I definitely won’t sell you off so easily!”\nThis woman still needed them so that they could support her in her old age…\nQiu Xingyuan suddenly remembered that they were still “valuable” to her in that way, and his small fists slowly relaxed.\nQiu Tong was amused. She assigned the children the task of settling into the new home, before returning to the internet cafe herself.\nLin Shan’s account had already been hacked by her. She quickly browsed through all her friends and soon found an individual folder containing a “Mr. Cui”.\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes. Making use of Lin Shan’s account, she sent Mr. Cui a file and successfully hacked into his phone.\nAll his phone records and transaction history were displayed clearly in front of her. After going through almost a thousand phone numbers, Qiu Tong finally locked her eyes on a single line.\nControlling Mr. Cui’s phone by remote access, she quickly sent a message to the other party. “The children are in my possession now.”\nThe other party replied quickly, “When will they arrive?”\nIt was indeed him!\nQiu Tong still wanted to chat with the other party, but the other party sensed that something was wrong. He immediately went offline and deleted his account, not giving Qiu Tong any time to track him.\nQiu Tong cursed under her breath. Time was of the essence, and she only managed to determine that he was situated in the capital!",

      "content": "Chapter 21: Kindergarten\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nThe capital again?!\nQiu Tong frowned, deep in thought.\nIn the original timeline, the three children were sold to the capital, but it was not specified to whom they were sold to.\nOnce and again, things were being linked to the capital. Qiu Tong didn’t think it was a coincidence.\nWhen she had first transmigrated over and was in the process of selling her children, could that have been arranged by the same person too?\nThe more Qiu Tong thought about it, the more likely it was. However, the former Qiu Tong was just a mother of three from slums. How could she know someone from the capital?\nCould it be the children’s father?\nAll sorts of conjectures flashed across her mind, but no matter how hard she tried, she could not remember who the children’s father was.\nOne mystery after another shrouded her. Qiu Tong walked back with a dark face and heavy footsteps.\nShe could not just continue to sit and wait for the other party to plot and steal her children!\nQiu Tong slowly narrowed her eyes. The experience of surviving in the post-apocalyptic world had given her a heightened sense of awareness when it came to danger. She could not allow the three children to end up like how they did in the original timeline.\nShe had to go out and look for opportunities to earn money. With enough money and power, they could stop struggling on the poverty line and be secure enough to face the unknown.\nHowever, it would be too risky for the three children to stay at home alone if Qiu Tong went out to earn money.\nAfter all, someone was hiding in the dark and eyeing the three children like a tiger watching its prey. They were waiting for an opportunity to snatch them away from her.\nQiu Tong’s brows were tightly furrowed. She was very dissatisfied with all these areas of vulnerability.\nAfter careful consideration, Qiu Tong’s eyes lit up.\nIf it was not safe to leave them at home, she would send them to school. Wasn’t this the best way to settle this once and for all?!\nCoincidentally, the three brats had reached the age of schooling.\n“Kindergarten?!”\nThree different voices raised their voices at the same time. Not only Qiu Xingyuan, but even Qiu Xingqiao and Qiu Xingyu were full of disdain and reluctance.\nQiu Tong beamed as she squatted down to coax them. “The kindergarten is very fun. There are playground slides and delicious food. You’ll get to know a lot of good friends there.”\nQiu Xingyu tilted her head. “I don’t want good friends. I only want Eldest Brother and Second Brother.”\nQiu Tong’s face stiffened for a moment. She persuaded gently, “Both your brothers will be going too.”\nQiu Xingqiao quickly said, “I’m not going!”\nWho would want to play with a bunch of weak snotty brats who would fall from just a light push?\nQiu Xingyuan just put on a very cold expression. His objection was very obvious.\nQiu Tong was not put off. She continued to encourage them. “Mommy will reward those who are willing to go to kindergarten with a kiss!”\nQiu Xingyu’s eyes lit up. Her mother had never kissed her before.\nQiu Xingyu ignored her brothers’ cold gazes and immediately switched sides. “Mommy, I will go to kindergarten!”\nQiu Tong pouted her lips and rewarded Qiu Xingyu with a big kiss.\nSince Little Yu was going to kindergarten, Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao would naturally feel uncomfortable at the thought of letting her go alone. They would definitely agree to go together.\nQiu Tong looked at Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao with a smile. The two brats instantly put on their guard. “What are you doing?”\nShe dragged the boys into her arms. Lowering her head, she kissed them both with two loud smacking sounds.\n“Wah—”\nQiu Xingqiao was like a cat whose tail had been stepped on. He immediately jumped up and wiped his face with all his might. “That’s disgusting!”\nQiu Xingyuan’s small face was stiff, his eyes displaying a similar look of disdain.\nQiu Tong threw back her head and laughed. The matter of the three Qiu family brats going to school was settled.\nThe next day, Qiu Tong brought the three children to a nearby kindergarten to report. After paying, they came out and saw a fat figure charging towards Qiu Xingyu and the other two like a cannonball.\nFortunately, Qiu Xingyuan was quick to react and pushed Little Yu away to prevent her from being bumped.\nInstead of being sorry, that little fatty arrogantly pointed at Qiu Xingyuan and the other two, his eyes filled with provocation.\n“You three bastards are not allowed to attend school here!”\n“Get out!”\nThe shrill voice was filled with malice, causing Qiu Tong to frown.",

Qiu Xingqiao stopped in his tracks, his face flushed red as he glared at the little fatty angrily.\nThe little fatty made a face at them. He was not afraid of Qiu Tong at all and continued to scold, “Even your own mother doesn’t like you guys. Without parents to take care of you, you guys are just illegitimate bastards!”\nQiu Xingyu held Qiu Xingyuan’s hand, her eyes already red.\n“Who said I don’t like them?”\nQiu Tong walked over and raised an eyebrow at the little fatty. She waved at him. “Come here and apologize to my children. You can be good friends.”\n“Pui!”\nThe little fatty stuck his hands on his hips, his gaze exceptionally arrogant. “Who wants to be good friends with three illegitimate children? And I didn’t say anything wrong, why should I apologize?”\nCompared to this little fatty, her three brats were like angels.\nQiu Tong put on a dark expression and deliberately deepened her voice. “Are you going to apologize or not?!”\nThe little fatty took a few steps back but remained stubborn. “I won’t apologize. What can you do to me?”\n“If you don’t apologize—”\nQiu Tong picked up a metal rod from the side and grinned. Even though she was smiling, she looked terrifying.\nShe grinned at the little fatty. Before his horrified gaze, she slowly bent the metal rod.\nThe metal rod that was as thick as a child’s arm twisted into a strange arc in the blink of an eye.\nShe narrowed her eyes slowly and curled her lips. “Be good and apologize or you’ll be next!”\nThe little fatty was petrified.\n“Wah—”\nShrill cries of terror pierced through the air. The little fatty was crying so hard that snot and tears were flowing. He looked at Qiu Tong as though she was a monster.\nQiu Tong’s face darkened again. “Apologize!”\nThe little fatty trembled and cried as he said, “Sorry.” Then, he quickly turned around and ran away!\nHe was just a rascal. Dealing with rascals was nothing to her!\nQiu Tong clapped her hands gleefully and turned around to find the three children looking at her with conflicted expressions.\n“What?”\nShe blinked in confusion. Qiu Xingqiao stammered as he pointed at the metal rod on the ground. “You… you bent it?”\n“If you train according to my method, you can also bend it with your bare hands in future.”\nThese words immediately made Qiu Xingqiao’s eyes light up. Even the way he looked at Qiu Tong changed.\nQiu Tong was about to leave with the three children when an angry figure suddenly charged over, accompanied by the little fatty who was crying.\n“Are you the one who bullied my child?!”\nBefore clarifying the matter, that person pointed at Qiu Tong’s nose. “Little witch! Do you have any shame? You dare to bully a child. Are you even human?”\nQiu Tong frowned and said coldly, “He was the one who scolded my children first.”\n“So what? Despicable people like you deserve to be scolded!”\nThe person spat viciously and looked at Qiu Tong with eyes full of disdain. “Besides, what’s wrong with just a couple of insults? It’s not like you are physically harmed by it. Why must you split hairs with the child?”\nQiu Tong finally understood. So this was that rascal’s parent.\n“Since you’re unwilling to teach your child, I don’t mind helping you to teach him.”\nHer gaze turned cold, and her tone was sharp. “If your child still dares to speak rudely to my children, I won’t be so nice next time!”\n“How dare you!”\nThe other party raised her voice and glared at Qiu Tong, looking like she wanted to eat her up. “Where did you come from? Do you know who I am? Believe it or not, I can get you and your three miscreants kicked out immediately!”\nA teacher who noticed the commotion quickly came over to smooth things over. “Parents, it’s normal for children to have conflicts. We don’t want…”\n“She has violent tendencies. I demand the kindergarten to kick out such incompetent parents immediately!”\nThe parent pointed at Qiu Tong arrogantly and narrowed her eyes viciously. “Take these three bastards and get lost. You’re not welcome here!”\nThe teacher’s face was filled with embarrassed awkwardness. There was nothing she could do but try and persuade both sides to calm down. However, the rascal’s parent refused to let things go.\nQiu Tong suddenly smiled coldly. “What did you just say?”\nThe parent raised her chin and repeated in a challenging tone, “I said, take these three bastards… Ah!”\nA loud slap landed on her face.\nQiu Tong retracted her hand, her smile still faint. “If you don’t know how to speak nicely, I can teach you.”\n“You dare to hit me?!”\nThe parent’s face instantly turned malevolent. She threw her fat body at Qiu Tong. “You little slut, I’m going to take your life!”\n“Stop!”\nA sudden shout rang out. Before Qiu Tong noticed what was happening, someone’s back profile appeared in front of her.\nA man stood firmly in front of her.",

      "content": "Chapter 23: Military Commander\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nQiu Tong frowned. She had never seen him before.\n“It’s just a conflict between children. Why should it escalate to a fight between adults?”\nThe person’s tone was polite and distant, but it was filled with an indisputable tone. “And it was indeed you who insulted them first. You should apologize.”\nThe fat parent was about to curse when she got a glimpse of the military rank on the man’s shoulder from the corner of her eye. She shuddered in fear.\nThis was a second lieutenant!\nHer mind immediately cleared up and she forced a smile. “Sir, you are right. We’ll leave immediately.”\n“Apologize.”\nThe second lieutenant commanded in a low voice. No matter how unwilling the fat parent was, she had no choice but to humble herself. Swallowing her anger, she said, “I’m sorry.” She then slunk away with her fat son.\nQiu Tong raised an eyebrow, confused by this sudden change in attitude.\nShe was about to thank the man when he turned around. His features were delicate, but his eyes were exceptionally clear. “Hello, I’m Shao An.”\nHe saluted Qiu Tong and said respectfully, “Thank you very much for saving our commander.”\nCommander?\nQiu Tong frowned, suddenly recalling the gunfight that day. So the man she had saved that day was a military officer?\nShe turned and replied calmly, “It was nothing.”\nHowever, Shao An was exceptionally insistent. He handed her a card as a thank-you gift. “This is just a small token. Please accept it.”\nQiu Tong accepted the card and turned to leave. “We’re even then.”\nGunfights and the military. Qiu Tong vaguely felt that the other party’s status was very troublesome. She had three little kids with her and did not want to be entangled with the other party’s affairs.\nOne card in exchange for his life. Just take it that he had the better end of the deal.\n“Wait.”\nShao An stopped her. A hint of sincerity appeared on his delicate face. “Our boss wants to thank you personally. Please come with me.”\nQiu Tong stopped in her tracks and raised her eyebrows. “No need. If he really wanted to thank me, why didn’t he come over himself?”\nShao An stepped forward, his tone somewhat urgent.\n“Please don’t misunderstand. Our boss’ identity is rather special. He can’t appear in public so easily…”\n“Then there’s even less reason for me to see him.”\nQiu Tong’s tone was cold and it was obvious that she wanted to draw a clear line between them. “I’m just an ordinary person. I don’t deserve to meet such a big shot.”\nShao An did not expect her to be so guarded. Seeing that Qiu Tong insisted on leaving, his expression changed slightly. His right hand subconsciously touched the gun at his waist. He planned to stop her using force.\n“Let her go.”\nA low and deep command came from the earpiece. Shao An’s expression changed, and he immediately stood where he was, replying softly, “Yes.”\nQiu Tong’s guard relaxed when she left the kindergarten and saw that the strange man did not follow her.\nShe could not be blamed for being paranoid. It was just that the person who was secretly targeting her children had not surfaced yet. She did not dare to let her guard down against anyone.\nAfter confirming that there was no danger, she squatted down and looked at the three children seriously. “You three stay at home obediently. I need to go out for a while.”\nThe three brats nodded and watched Qiu Tong leave. Qiu Xingqiao moved closer to Qiu Xingyuan. “Why has this woman changed so much?”\nAnd became so mysterious.\nQiu Xingyuan did not say anything. Qiu Xingyu hugged the doll that Qiu Tong had won for her and pouted as she said softly, “I prefer my current mommy.”\nAfter settling the kids at home, Qiu Tong found a nearby underground market.\nShe was alone and unarmed. It would be difficult for her to fight with more than one person at once. If she were to encounter any danger in the future, it would be difficult to ensure the safety of the three children.\nTherefore, she needed a weapon to be fully prepared.\n“Do you have guns?”\nShe glanced at the equipment on the counter and asked the boss who was settling the accounts in a low voice. The boss glanced at her and turned to walk in. “Follow me.”\nQiu Tong followed him and realized that there was another world inside.\nRarely-seen guns and prohibited items on the market were like street goods here, lined up in a row.\nQiu Tong’s eyes lit up. She touched the guns lovingly and carefully, before finally selecting a silver pistol.\n“This one.”\nShe handed over the card Shao An had given her earlier. She failed to notice a change in the expression of the originally lukewarm boss.\nHe sized up the woman in front of him with a bewildered gaze. The boss took the card with both hands and said respectfully, “Please wait a moment.”\nQiu Tong raised an eyebrow in surprise. People in this trade, did they usually provide such good service?",

The three brats complained incessantly, but they were so tired that they did not even have the strength to cause trouble.\nWhile she was supervising the three naughty brats’ sit-ups, Qiu Tong suddenly received a text message asking her to participate in the second stage of the boxing competition, to be held tomorrow afternoon at the address stated below.\nQiu Tong frowned when she found the place according to the address.\nIt was a boxing arena hidden in a secluded corner of a street. It was very inconspicuous and there were random advertisements plastered on the signboard. It looked extremely unofficial.\nShe stepped inside. A passage led underground. Before she had even moved close to the curtain flaps, she could already hear waves of loud cheers and screams.\nHot blood, sweat, and shouts were enough to make anyone’s blood surge.\nThe boxing arena was a few hundred square meters and filled with spectators. In the middle was a boxing ring that was over a dozen square meters and stained with blood.\n“Number 141, match 31.”\nAn official at the door callously announced her match and number. Qiu Tong located her boxing ring. A short, muscular man in shorts was already standing on it.\nShe stood hesitantly below the stage. “This boxing ring isn’t a proper one, is it?”\n“Proper?”\nThe opponent sneered. He rested his arms on the rope and narrowed his eyes coldly. “Life and death is up to fate. Scram if you’re afraid!”\nQiu Tong slowly wrapped her hands with the boxing handwraps and went on stage with a worried look on her face. “Will they go back on their word about the $30,000 prize money?”\nSo she was only worried about the prize money?!\nThe opponent was speechless. He was offended at being taken lightly by this little woman. He gritted his teeth and said angrily, “We’ll talk about that when you have actually survived this match!”\n“Ding!”\nThe bell rang, and a series of wolf-like cries nearly brought down the roof. It had been a long time since Qiu Tong felt her blood surge like that. Her blood vessels contracted crazily, and her eyes burned with a crazy fighting spirit.\n“Little girl, you don’t belong in a place like this!”\nThe opponent licked his lips and revealed a cold smile. He raised his hand and made a slashing motion at his neck. “Go home!”\nQiu Tong smirked, her eyes calm and expressionless.\nShe bent her elbows slightly and leaned back, her entire body arching like a cheetah.\n“You are just good for show.”\nThe opponent sneered and threw a punch.\n“Swoosh—”\nQiu Tong’s movements were too fast. In the blink of an eye, she appeared behind her opponent. No one could see how she moved. She bent her knees and drew a sharp arc, her knee arcing like an arrow towards her opponent’s waist.\nA fatal move!\nThe man’s pupils constricted violently, and a suffocating feeling of death welled up in his heart. His survival instincts took over and he ducked pathetically to the side, just barely managing to avoid that fatal blow.\nThe audience was in an uproar. Everyone looked at the stage in shock. A man and a woman, one strong and one weak. The stark contrast was completely reversed by Qiu Tong’s astonishing strength.\n“Qiu Tong! Qiu Tong!”\nAfter a few seconds of silence in the stands, an even louder cry erupted from the stands, gradually forming waves of cheers that engulfed the boxing ring.\nThe man on the stage had an ugly look on his face. He no longer dared to underestimate Qiu Tong and was on full alert.\nHe had to end this quickly!\nQiu Tong’s gaze sharpened. She punched quickly, accurately and ruthlessly. Her punches landed heavily on the man’s face, causing him to spit out blood and retreat hastily.\nShe bent her knees and jumped. In the boxing ring, she was like a fighting machine, blocking the man’s escape route. Her long arms reached out and grabbed the man’s arm. Her petite figure bent over as twisted her feet around.\n“Crash!”\nThe sound of his body landing heavily on the cement ground rang out loud. One could also hear the sound of bone breaking.\nThe arrogant and despotic man was lying on the ground like a pile of dirt. The coldness in Qiu Tong’s eyes faded and she smiled faintly.\n“I’m sorry, it has been too long since I last fought, so I haven’t figured out how to adjust my strength.”\nThe cheers and screams in the stands were deafening. Qiu Tong frowned and sat calmly on the stage, waiting for the next round.\nNo one dared to look down on her, the only woman. Qiu Tong’s speed was too fast, and her movements tricky. Her figure was slender and agile, and she ended every match as fast as she could.\n“The champion is—Qiu Tong!”\nAs the referee blew the whistle, Qiu Tong breathed heavily and her eyes lit up. $30,000!\nIn a hidden private room in the corner of the second floor, a sharp eagle-like gaze locked onto Qiu Tong’s slender figure. Jin Yang’s thin lips curled up slightly.\nNo wonder she dared to save him that time. It turned out that this woman was extremely skilled.\nQiu Tong was about to leave after receiving the prize money when the organizer stopped her.\n“Qiu Tong, there’s an additional segment. Do you want to participate?”\nQiu Tong paused. The organizer tactfully added, “If you participate, you can win another $30,000!”\nAnother $30,000?!\nBring it on!\nQiu Tong nodded without hesitation. When she stood on the boxing ring, she realized that the organizer was holding a cheetah!",

Just for the sake of entertainment?\nIndeed, only the rich could come up with such a perverse thing.\nQiu Tong clenched her fists, her eyes turning cold.\nSeeing that the person participating in the additional segment was a woman, an abnormally intense jeering and whistling immediately sounded from the crowd.\n“You still have a chance to back out now.”\nThe organizer noticed that Qiu Tong’s expression was not quite right. Although she was very powerful, she was still a woman and she was facing a ferocious beast without any conscience or rationality. As a result, the organizer could not help but feel a bit of compassion for her. “I will still transfer you the initial $30,000.”\nQiu Tong’s eyes flickered and she slowly tightened her handwraps. “No need.”\nShe had specially analyzed the rules of the additional segment. Apart from the final reward of $30,000, she could also receive tips from the rich people in the audience.\nAnd those tips usually started from $2,000. One could get as much as $10,000 in tips in a match.\n“I can…”\nJust as she was about to agree, a staff member rushed over and whispered something into the organizer’s ear.\nThe organizer’s expression changed. He gave Qiu Tong a meaningful look before putting on a business-like smile.\n“Miss Qiu, the guest in Private Room Eight is willing to pay $150,000 for your participation in the additional segment.”\nPrivate Room Eight?\nQiu Tong looked up at the second floor, but the glass in the room was too opaque for her to see anything.\nWho would spend $150,000 on her?\nQiu Tong found it a little strange and felt rather wary of the situation. She pursed her lips and refused coldly. “I don’t know the guest in Private Room Eight. I don’t need his money.”\nRegardless of what the other party’s motive was, Qiu Tong did not want to owe him a favor. She took off her jacket and revealed her lean, strong body, before stepping into the boxing ring without hesitation.\n“Rumble—”\nWaves of heat surged towards her. Before Qiu Tong could get used to it, a hoarse and irritable growl came from behind her.\nA pair of dark golden eyes locked onto her.\nThe two-meter long and half-human-height cheetah was released from the cage, and its deep roar instantly silenced the entire crowd. Everyone held their breaths, not daring to look away, afraid that Qiu Tong would be splattered with blood in the next instant.\n“Roar!”\nThe beastly roar that was filled with killing intent and threat faded away. A dark golden streak shot straight at Qiu Tong, as a foul-smelling hot air blew over.\nQiu Tong reacted quickly. She leaned back her upper body as the cheetah jumped over her. Its paws landed on the ground, and in the blink of an eye, it turned to try and bite Qiu Tong again.\nIt was too fast!\nQiu Tong rolled to the ground in a sorry state and threw a punch. Suddenly, there was a sharp flash and a tearing sound. Her arm was slashed by a sharp claw and blood gushed out.\nStimulated by the smell of blood, the cheetah’s attack became even more frenzy.\nQiu Tong gritted her teeth and leaped upwards. She somersaulted and landed on the back of the cheetah.\n“Roar!”\nSensing that there was someone on its back, the cheetah went mad. It sped around the boxing ring, slamming into the sides with all its might. Qiu Tong gritted her teeth and grabbed onto the short hairs on the cheetah’s neck as she quickly thought of a solution.\nNo one expected Qiu Tong to last so long with the cheetah!\nThe audience was about to explode. Everyone stood up, their eyes shining with excitement as they screamed like crazy.\nQiu Tong no longer had the energy to pay attention to what was happening below the ring. She clung onto the cheetah’s neck with all her strength. Suddenly, she was flung against a pillar beside the boxing ring.\n“Ah!”\nScreams of fear and excitement rang out. Everyone could not help but widen their eyes as they saw the bright yellow beast charging straight at Qiu Tong, who had fallen to the ground.\nQiu Tong pursed her lips and her pupils constricted. The cheetah’s gaping jaws gradually magnified before her eyes.\n“Click—”\nIn Private Room Eight on the second floor, Jin Yang’s eyes were cold.. He expressionlessly unlocked the safety catch and aimed the black gun at the cheetah.",

Just as the cheetah was about to pounce on her, she lifted her leg and kicked the cheetah’s chin. Pushing off the ground with one hand, she twisted her nimble and slender waist, before straightening her body and leaping onto the cheetah’s neck!\nShe had escaped from the jaws of death!\nEveryone’s hearts nearly stopped at her move. The screams from the stands were loud enough to shatter glass. Money bills were tossed at her like snowflakes.\nQiu Tong was not in the mood to look. All her attention was on the raging cheetah, and her injured wrist was gradually losing strength.\nShe could not delay any longer.\nHer slender legs flew forward and clamped down on the cheetah’s neck like a pair of scissors. With a violent and arrogant howl, she exerted force on her legs, and the sound of bones breaking was especially clear.\nThe cheetah slowly crumbled to the ground. Its dark golden body lay motionless on the floor.\nQiu Tong stood up, panting. Her face and body were soaked with blood. She had a wild and exciting beauty that pierced the eyes of the crowd.\n“Qiu Tong! Qiu Tong!”\nWaves of cheers erupted from the stands, and everyone’s faces turned red as they shouted crazily. They had personally witnessed the birth of a miracle. Qiu Tong had really defeated the cheetah and won the additional segment!\nIn Private Room Eight on the second floor, Jin Yang’s eyes shone brightly.\n“Invite her here.”\nHis low and deep voice was filled with admiration. He turned his head and ordered Shao An to invite Qiu Tong over, but Shao An had his own concerns.\n“Mr. President, I’m not sure about Qiu Tong’s background. She’s just a single mother, yet she’s so skilled. I’m afraid her background might be complicated.”\n“Furthermore, her appearance during the attack was too coincidental. I suspect that someone was behind it.”\n“With your special status, it’s best not to meet civilians in private.”\n“Are you done?”\nJin Yang narrowed his eyes slowly, his expression unchanged as he said indifferently, “Bring her up.”\n“Mr. President!”\nShao An’s tone was a little anxious. Their expedition this time had been a trap all along. It was an opportunity deliberately created for the terrorists to try and assassinate the president, so that they could catch the mastermind behind everything.\nBut if Jin Yang summoned Qiu Tong on impulse, it might alert the enemy.\nJin Yang glanced at him coldly and Shao An instantly fell silent. He lowered his head with a dark expression and resigned himself to his fate as he went out to get Qiu Tong.\nApart from the $30,000 prize money as the grand champion of the boxing matches, there was also the $30,000 for the additional segment, as well as tips from the audience. All in all, she had received a total of about $100,000 in cash.\nSatisfied, Qiu Tong signed her name and prepared to leave with the money.\n“Miss Qiu.”\nShao An, whom she had met at the kindergarten, suddenly appeared beside her and looked at her expressionlessly. “Our Boss wants to thank you in person.”\nQiu Tong raised an eyebrow. “No need. I’ve already received my money. We’re even.”\nShao An stood in front of her with abnormal persistence. His gaze was especially stubborn. “Our Boss only wants to meet you. Please come with me.”\nSeeing that the other party was so persistent in wanting to see her, Qiu Tong frowned. She could vaguely feel that she had piqued the interest of a very troublesome character.\nIn order to quickly draw a clear line with the other party, Qiu Tong gestured for Shao An to lead the way. When they reached the second floor, she realized that they were the guests in Private Room Eight!\n“Hello, Miss Qiu. My name is Song Yan.”\nIn the private room, Jin Yang was wearing a black windbreaker. His facial features were deep and reserved. He had sharp eyebrows and bright eyes. His light-colored eyes appeared amiable, but they were actually filled with keen sharpness. From time to time, they would flash with a harsh glint.\nHe had purposely used his younger brother’s name.\n“Hi.”\nWhile Qiu Tong was sizing up Jin Yang, he was also sizing her up. He saw that Qiu Tong was unexpectedly thin and weak.\nThere was actually such a huge amount of energy hidden in such a slender and frail body. Jin Yang quietly raised his eyebrows and became more interested in Qiu Tong.\nJin Yang glanced at the wound on Qiu Tong’s forehead and a dark glint flashed across his eyes.\nPreviously, the fatal wound on his chest had unexpectedly healed without any treatment. After eliminating several other suspects, Jin Yang cast his suspicious gaze towards Qiu Tong now.\nCould this woman have healing powers?\nHe had always known that the parliament was secretly implementing a human modification plan, but this plan was a highly-classified secret of the government and could not be divulged to the outside world. Only high-ranking personnel knew of it. Moreover, as far as he knew, none of the human modification experiments had been successful, and none of the subjects had been released.\nWas Qiu Tong a modified human?\n“Miss Qiu, it’s all thanks to you that my injuries from the previous incident recovered so quickly.”\nJin Yang nonchalantly tried to probe her. “Your injuries are so serious this time, I’m afraid you need to rest well.”\nQiu Tong touched her forehead. She was very guarded and did not use her supernatural power to heal herself. She just nodded casually. “Yes, just doing what’s necessary to survive.”\nShe narrowed her eyes and looked at Jin Yang with a thoughtful look. “Mr. Song, where are you from? Have we met before?”\nQiu Tong rubbed her chin thoughtfully. “Why do I find you so familiar?”",

      "content": "Chapter 27: Enemy Attack\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nShao An was shocked and instinctively stood in front of Jin Yang, his left hand on the gun handle at his waist.\nJin Yang held him back calmly and said with a faint smile, “Maybe my looks are rather common.”\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes and scanned his features before shaking her head silently.\n“I think you look a little like my three kids.”\nShe asked in a serious tone, “Mr. Song, is it possible that you had three children while you were out sowing your wild oats?”\nShao An coughed violently, looking at Qiu Tong with fear and unease, as if she had said something outrageous.\nJin Yang didn’t expect her to be like all those other women, trying to link themselves to him. His eyes narrowed and his expression gradually turned cold.\n“No. You got the wrong guy.”\nThe change in his attitude was too obvious. Qiu Tong was slightly stunned. She immediately understood the key point and could not help but laugh.\n“Mr. Song, please don’t misunderstand. I don’t have ulterior motives.”\nShe really felt that the children looked a little like him.\nWhen Qiu Tong smiled, the corners of her eyes would scrunch up, inadvertently revealing the innocence of a young girl.\nJin Yang frowned. There seemed to be someone in his memory who smiled like that…\nIt should be someone he was very familiar with, but no matter how Jin Yang tried to recall, he could not recall that person’s appearance or name.\n“Ah!”\nA piercing pain like an electric shock struck his brain and blocked his memories. Jin Yang trembled in pain and Shao An immediately rushed over anxiously.\n“Sir, are you all right?”\nHe shielded Jin Yang behind him, before pulling out his gun and aiming it at Qiu Tong. He interrogated her harshly, “What did you do to him?!”\nQiu Tong raised her hands innocently to show that she was not aggressive. “I didn’t do anything.”\n“Shao An, stop!”\nJin Yang gritted his teeth as he endured the pain with great difficulty. Panting slightly, his face had turned pale.\n“I’m sorry, Miss Qiu. Shao An was too impulsive. Please don’t mind him.”\nQiu Tong didn’t take it to heart and was about to find an excuse to leave when she heard Jin Yang continue, “I also think Miss Qiu looks a little familiar. I think I’ve seen her somewhere before.”\nQiu Tong gave a self-deprecating smile. “How could someone like Mr. Song know me?”\n“I’m just the daughter of a financial fraud and I am burdened with three kids. Maybe I really got the wrong person.”\nJin Yang’s heart stirred. “Your father is?”\n“Qiu Rong.”\nQiu Tong replied in a mild tone. Jin Yang quickly ran through his mind and realized that he indeed did not know anyone called Qiu Rong.\nIt seemed that Qiu Tong was really not an experimental subject in the human modification plan.\nJin Yang frowned slightly and was about to ask Shao An to send her back when suddenly, there was a gunshot and the glass surrounding the private room shattered.\n“Enemy attack!”\nShao An immediately stood by Jin Yang’s side, protecting him. His eyes turned cold and he shouted angrily, “Sir, you leave first. I’ll cover your retreat!”\n“Ah!”\nThe boxing ring outside had been completely taken over by the terrorists. Everyone was covering their heads and scurrying away like rats. It was chaos.\nQiu Tong noticed that the people outside seemed to be divided into two groups. One group was obviously here for Mr. Song, while the other group was surrounding the terrorists with weapons.\nCould they be Mr. Song’s men?\nBefore Qiu Tong could figure out what was going on, a gust of wind blew toward her and she threw herself to the side. The bullet whizzed past her ear and shattered the vase behind her.\nShe might die for no reason if she were to continue staying here!\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes and took out the pistol that she had spent a lot of money on. With a sharp look in her eyes, she rushed out of the bar counter and shot at several people.\nHer movements quickly attracted the attention of the terrorists. Four or five people surrounded her with ugly expressions. Qiu Tong gritted her teeth as she reloaded.\n“Bang! Bang!”\nBullets had no eyes. Qiu Tong pushed the table beside her to protect herself as she moved towards the exit.\n“Miss Qiu!”\nShao An appeared out of nowhere, followed by the stern-looking Jin Yang.\nThe other party directly pushed Jin Yang to Qiu Tong’s side. Shao An’s expression was solemn and murderous. “I’ll hold them back. You take Boss and leave through the side door first!”\nQiu Tong did not want to be implicated in this, but Shao An had already run away.\nGritting her teeth, Qiu Tong pulled Jin Yang and rushed out of the side door!\nQiu Tong’s luck was heaven-defying. The moment they rushed out, they saw a heavy-duty motorcycle parked right in front of them.\nWithout any hesitation, she leaped up and swiftly got on. “Come on!”\nTossing a helmet at Jin Yang, Qiu Tong was propping herself up on the motorcycle with one leg. Her leg was long and shapely, and she looked very dashing.\nJin Yang couldn’t resist admiring the sight for a few seconds.\nNoticing that he was not moving, Qiu Tong pushed her hair back and looked at him. “You know how to ride a motorcycle, right?”",

A loud roaring noise rang out followed by the screeching sound of brakes. They shot forward like arrows.\nThe terrorists who were following closely behind also caught up. Qiu Tong bent over slightly, her entire body like a falcon, but also like a cheetah prowling the city. The roar of the heavy motorcycle echoed through the streets, finally shaking off the terrorists.\n“Done.”\nShe parked the car on an empty street and took off her helmet. Her messy hair fell across her forehead. The wildness radiating off her body was captivating. “There shouldn’t be anyone chasing after us.”\n“Thank you. You saved me again.”\nCurling his lips, Jin Yang did not try to hide the admiration in his eyes. “How can I repay you?”\nQiu Tong fiddled with the helmet and glanced at him casually. “No need. Your subordinate already gave me a lot of money. The amount is enough for me to save you twice. No need to repay me further.”\nThe other party’s status was obviously very mysterious. They had only met twice, and he was still being pursued.\nQiu Tong was unwilling to have anything to do with such a troublesome character.\nJin Yang did not expect such an answer. The warmth and affection in his heart was instantly extinguished as if doused by a basin of cold water.\nQiu Tong’s heartbeat quickened when she saw the time on her watch.\nOh no, the three brats were almost done with school!\nHurriedly leaving the motorcycle and helmet behind, she ran off, turning her head to shout at Jin Yang, “Stay here and don’t move. Shao An will come looking for you soon!”\n“I have something urgent to attend to, I’ll make a move first.”\nWith that, she flagged down a taxi by the roadside and hurried towards the kindergarten.\nWatching her hasty departure, Jin Yang felt both exasperated and amused.\nShao An only gave her a little money, but it was enough for her to save him twice?\nWas his life so worthless?\n“Sir!”\nShao An, who had successfully quelled the chaos, rushed over with his men. After discovering that Jin Yang was safe and sound, he finally heaved a huge sigh of relief.\nJin Yang nodded at him and his tone returned to normal. “How’s the situation?”\n“The terrorists have been successfully subdued and the leader behind them has been captured.”\nJin Yang was quite satisfied with Shao An’s report. He indicated for Shao An to send those people back to the capital directly.\n“Send them to the capital and punish them according to the law.”\nShao An lowered his head, indicating his acknowledgment of the order. He looked at Jin Yang hesitantly. “Sir, Qiu Tong didn’t do anything to hurt you, right?”\nJin Yang gave him a strange look and said coldly, “No, why would she want to hurt me?”\nShao An cleared his throat, a hint of doubt appeared in his eyes.\n“But she didn’t recognize you?!”\nAlthough his Boss had disguised himself as Song Yan, who in the country would fail to recognize the face of the president?\n“Is she pretending?”\nJin Yang frowned and thought about it. He felt that it was impossible. Qiu Tong’s attitude towards him was very natural, and the way she treated him was like any ordinary person.\n“Sir, should we send someone to follow her?”\nShao An asked in a low voice.\nJin Yang pondered for a moment before decisively rejecting. “Without my orders, no one is allowed to disturb her!”\n…\nBy the time Qiu Tong rushed to the kindergarten, most of the children had already been fetched away.\nOnly the three brats were left standing at the door carrying their school bags and their heads lowered. They looked rather pitiful.\nQiu Tong’s heart softened and she explained in a gentle voice, “Mommy has something else to attend to. That’s why I’m late.”\n“Mother Qiu.”\nThe kindergarten teacher’s expression was rather grim. She glanced at the three brats and pulled Qiu Tong aside. She whispered, “These three children did not perform well today. They were very unsociable and even tried to skip class midway.”\nFortunately, the kindergarten teacher discovered it in time. Otherwise, the three little brats would have successfully escaped from their “prison”!\n“It might be because it’s their first day in kindergarten and they’re still not used to it. Go back and counsel them.”\nSeeing Qiu Tong’s dark face, the teacher tried to placate her and told her to find a chance to have a good talk with the children.\nQiu Tong gritted her teeth. These brats!\nWhat kind of danger would they have faced if they had left the kindergarten?\nSuppressing the anger in her heart, Qiu Tong apologized to the teacher and led the three troublesome children back in a huff.\nThe boys walked behind nonchalantly, but Little Yu’s eyes were filled with worry.\nShe whispered to her brothers, “Mommy is angry.”",

A trace of apprehension flashed across his eyes, but he still said stubbornly, “At most, she’ll sell us again. It’s not like she hasn’t done it before!”\nQiu Xingyuan only silently patted Qiu Xingyu’s head and comforted her. “This has nothing to do with you. Your Second Brother and I will bear the responsibility.”\nThese three children were quite loyal to each other.\nQiu Tong was so angry that she actually felt like laughing. As soon as she got home, she demanded, “Tell me, why did you skip class?!”\n“Those other children are childish and annoying. Who wants to be with them?”\nQiu Xingqiao had a look of disdain, while Qiu Xingyuan put on a wooden expression and said indifferently, “I don’t want to attend kindergarten.”\n“Do you think you can refuse to go just because you don’t want to?!”\nQiu Tong raised her voice, feeling even angrier. “Explain yourself, or none of you will escape my wrath!”\n“No reason!”\nQiu Xingqiao glared back at her angrily. “Beat us if you want. We’re not going to kindergarten!”\nHe raised his head and closed his eyes tightly, looking like he was ready to grin and bear it, to let Qiu Tong scold and beat him.\nHowever, his eyelashes were trembling violently. He was not as firm as he sounded.\nQiu TTong’s heart softened again. She dragged the two kids to the balcony and made them stand there in the horse stance as punishment. They were not allowed to come in for dinner unless they admitted they were in the wrong.\nQiu Xingyu leaned on the glass door and looked at her two brothers whose legs were trembling from the effort of maintaining the horse stance. With a sad face, she walked over to Qiu Tong.\n“Mommy, can you not be angry? My brothers didn’t do it on purpose. It’s all because those children were too overbearing. They said that we don’t have a father and refused to play with us. They even bullied me. That’s why my brothers brought me away.”\nQiu Tong was stunned. She did not expect the real reason to be this.\nAt the thought of the three children being ostracized in the kindergarten and then being immediately reprimanded by her when they returned, Qiu Tong felt rather dismayed and asked Qiu Xingyu to call Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao in.\nQiu Xingyuan was still expressionless, but Qiu Xingqiao’s eyes were red as he glared at Qiu Tong angrily.\nQiu Tong was amused, but she kept a straight face. “Let’s eat.”\nIn order to make up for the grievances suffered by the children, she specially cooked two more dishes that Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao liked to eat, filling the entire table.\nIgnoring the children, Qiu Tong sat down and began digging in.\nCompared to her, the three children’s table manners could be considered elegant.\n“You look like you’ve been starving for years. Even beggars have better table manners than you.”\nQiu Xingqiao looked disgusted.\nQiu Tong looked up at him and said nonchalantly.\n“What’s the point of having good table manners? There’s no food on the table at all in a post-apocalyptic world. Who would care about table manners then?”\nShe lifted her chin and gestured at the three children’s full bowls. Her tone was full of threat. “Finish your food. Don’t leave a single grain behind.”\n“You’re not allowed to be picky. Eat more!”\nShe ordered the three children to eat quickly, and the three children were rather disdainful of her post-apocalyptic theory, thinking that it was just her crazy talk.\nThe sky had just turned dark. Qiu Tong cleared her throat and stopped the boys, who were about to return to their bedroom. She said seriously, “Before we sleep, I’ll tell you a bedtime story.”\n“A little snail asked his mother why he had to carry a hard and heavy shell from birth? Why don’t his friends, the caterpillar and earthworm have shells?”\n“His mother told him that the caterpillar would become a butterfly and be protected by the sky; while the earthworm would be protected by the earth. Meanwhile, the snail would be protected by no one. The little snail was very sad to hear this, and felt sorry for himself, for no one could protect him.”\n“But Mother Snail explained that this is why we carry the heavy shell—we can rely on ourselves!”\nThe story was short, and Qiu Tong did not know if the three children understood her. Qiu Xingyu was the first to pounce on her and plant a big kiss on her face.\n“Mommy, I understand now. Although we don’t have a father and can only carry the heavy shell of our lives, this heavy shell will also make us stronger. We can rely on ourselves!”\nQiu Tong was very pleased by their intelligence.\nThe boys also looked more happy now. The gloominess between their brows dissipated.\nWhen Qiu Tong said goodnight to them, Qiu Xingqiao replied awkwardly. Qiu Xingyuan, on the other hand, took a long, meaningful look at Qiu Tong. It was rare that there was no coldness or suspicion in his eyes.\n…\nWith money, Qiu Tong finally began to decorate her new home.\nHowever, she did not expect that an uninvited guest would come knocking first.\n“Qiu Tong.”\nYu Ge, who had been standing downstairs, saw the four of them from afar and immediately came up to them. He enthusiastically wanted to help Qiu Tong carry her bags.. “Why didn’t you tell me you moved? I’ve been looking for you for so long.”",

Yu Ge’s eyes flashed with anger, but he quickly suppressed it.\n“I’m your boyfriend. Isn’t it normal for me to look for you?”\nHe looked at Qiu Tong affectionately and reached out to hug her. “Are you still angry with me? I was just too anxious. I just want the two of us to be together sooner.”\n“If you can’t bear to part with these three children, we can also not send them away. I can treat them as my own children and raise them together.”\nQiu Tong found Yu Ge’s wishful thinking laughable.\n“Who wants to raise them with you?”\nShe narrowed her eyes coldly and glared at Yu Ge warningly. “We have already broken up, so please get lost!”\n“Do you think you can break up with me just like that? Did you ask for my permission?”\nYu Ge quietly gritted his teeth as he sized up Qiu Tong and the three children impassively. He noticed that their clothes were neat and their skin was fair and tender. It was obvious that they were living well.\nDamn it, Qiu Tong didn’t tell him that she had money!\nYu Ge felt deep regret. If he had known earlier, he would not have fallen out with Qiu Tong so early. He would have made the woman spit up all her money before dumping her!\nHe shamelessly moved forward to hold Qiu Tong’s hand. “Qiu Tong, my feelings for you are sincere. Let’s start again, okay?”\nHe even took out his identity card and tried to prove his sincerity. “Haven’t you always wanted to marry me? Look, I even brought my identity card!”\n“We will go to the Civil Affairs Bureau to register our marriage now!”\nYu Ge stole a glance at Qiu Tong’s face and saw that she was expressionless. He couldn’t resist adding boldly, “However, I don’t have a place to stay yet. Since we will get married sooner or later, can my name be added to the property deed?”\nSo he was after the house.\nQiu Tong raised an eyebrow and reached out to take his identity card.\nYu Ge thought that she had changed her mind and his eyes lit up with joy. The three children also widened their eyes nervously.\nLooking at the picture on the identity card, Qiu Tong sneered and suddenly kept it.\n“Qiu Tong, what do you mean by that?”\nYu Ge did not understand, but he saw Qiu Tong staring at him coldly.\n“Yu Ge, even if you think of yourself as trash, I am not a trash recycling station.”\n“I’ll keep your identity card for the time being. I was young and ignorant in the past when I lent you $15,000. I’ll return your card when you give me back my money!”\nWhen did she lend him $15,000? She was clearly the one who willingly gave the money to him!\nYu Ge’s face alternated between green and white. With a twisted face, he lunged at Qiu Tong. “Give me back my identity card!”\nThree small figures suddenly appeared from the side. Qiu Xingqiao lifted his leg and kicked Yu Ge’s knee hard. Qiu Xingyu picked up a rock and threw it at him. Qiu Xingyuan took out the medicinal powder that he had not used up the last time and sprinkled it on Yu Ge’s face again.\nThe familiar itchy rashes spread crazily once again. Yu Ge finally knew that the culprit who had caused him to be so miserable last time was actually the children. His eyes immediately turned fierce.\n“Just you wait! I won’t let you off!”\nAfter he said that, the itch on his face became worse. He did not dare to stay any longer and ran away without looking back.\n“Coward.”\nQiu Tong snorted in disdain. How dare this kind of person try to snatch her children?\nShe turned around and found that the three children were staring at her strangely.\nShe raised her eyebrows in confusion. “Why are you looking at me like that?”\n“Mommy, don’t you like him anymore?”\nQiu Xingyu asked carefully. They remembered that their mother had beaten and scolded them many times for that man.\n“He hurt you all. How can I still like him?”\nThese simple words made the three children’s hearts tremble.\nQiu Tong had been obsessed with Yu Ge because of her own sad life. They knew how crazy and determined Qiu Tong was, but they did not expect her to abandon Yu Ge for them.\nHad Qiu Tong really changed?\nThe three children returned home in silence. Qiu Tong was in high spirits as she instructed them to decorate the house. The atmosphere was rather harmonious.\nSoon, the home appliances Qiu Tong ordered online arrived.\nLooking at the electrical appliances piled up in the living room, the three children studied the instruction manuals helplessly.\nTheir standard of living in the past was too dismal. They had never come into contact with such high-tech appliances. Even Qiu Xingyuan, who had the highest IQ, was helpless.\n“Brother, would she regret things now and go back to that man for help?”\nQiu Xingqiao looked at Qiu Tong, who was squatting on the ground and fiddling with the electrical appliances. A deep suspicion flashed across his eyes. Apart from asking Yu Ge for help, he really did not know who else Qiu Tong could get to assemble the appliances.\nQiu Xingyuan pursed his lips and lowered his eyes. “She can look for whoever she wants.”\nHowever, the three brats were soon shocked to see Qiu Tong successfully assembling all the appliances and connecting them to the electrical system.\n“Come here!”\nQiu Tong clapped her hands gleefully and looked at the big color television that she had carefully selected. She planned to let the three children watch TV together to relax.\nJust as she switched on the television, a familiar face suddenly appeared.",

She only had a vague understanding of this world.\nQiu Tong logged on to the internet and entered the word “President.” Immediately, a large amount of information and favorable commentaries on the president popped up on the front page. The person in the photo was Song Yan.\nHowever, the strange thing was that the name of the president on the internet was clearly Jin Yang.\nThen who was Song Yan?\nQiu Tong entered Song Yan’s name and found that they were actually half-brothers.\nShe narrowed her eyes and compared the two photos. She realized that Song Yan and Jinyang were very similar. She continued to look through the information, but the description of the president’s civil conflict was extremely complicated and obscure. It took a lot of effort before she managed to sort out the connections.\nAlthough Song Yan and Jin Yang were brothers, the two of them were at odds with each other in every aspect, be it political standing, world view, personality, methods and so on.\nCould the previous two assassinations be arranged by Jin Yang to deal with Song Yan?\nOtherwise, who would dare to assassinate the president’s brother?!\nQiu Tong vaguely felt that she had witnessed some unspeakable secret. She immediately closed all the webpages and forced herself to forget all her surmisations.\nHer only thought at the moment was to raise the three brats safely and make sure they didn’t go astray. These political struggles had nothing to do with her, and it wasn’t as if she, a commoner, could interfere at will.\nAfter purchasing and decorating the house, Qiu Tong still had more than $10,000 in cash.\nHowever, the theory of the time value of money meant that cash in hand would only depreciate over time. Anyway, there would come the day when everything would be spent.\nShe had to think of a way to maximize the funds at hand. Only then would she be able to continuously create new wealth!\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes as a thought flashed through her mind.\nShe remembered that in the original timeline, there would be a major locust plague happening this year, causing the production of food to decrease sharply and the demand to increase substantially, creating a food shortage.\nIf she took this opportunity to stock up on some food and sell it later, wouldn’t she earn a lot?!\nQiu Tong’s eyes lit up. After finding the right business opportunity, she immediately brought the three children to the food market.\nThe three children were already immune to her sudden actions now. Although they did not understand why Qiu Tong suddenly wanted to stock up on food in such large quantities, she was the one earning the money, so they had no reason to question her.\nQiu Xingqiao yawned lazily as he watched Qiu Tong haggle with others.\n“Is she possessed by a ghost again? Can she finish so much food?”\nQiu Xingqiao suddenly halted. He thought of Qiu Tong’s usual eating habits and hesitated.\nActually, she might really be able to finish everything…\nQiu Xingyuan held onto Qiu Xingyu and did not speak. He was also clutching a chemistry book.\nQiu Xingqiao shifted his gaze away uninterestedly. Suddenly, he noticed a large group of people gathered not far away. He immediately rushed over to watch the commotion in excitement.\nHe had just taken a step when he collided with a little girl.\n“Ah!”\nHer terrified cries were filled with pain and dismay. Ignoring the wound on her knee, the little girl desperately tried to pick up the grains scattered on the ground with her skinny hands. “My grains, my grains!”\nLarge drops of tears fell onto the ground. Qiu Xingqiao was a little embarrassed. He squatted down and apologized softly, “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to.”\nThe other party did not seem to have heard her. She just continued to pick up her grains from the ground in a frenzy. Seeing that some grains had landed in the middle of the road, she rushed over without thinking.\n“Be careful!”\nQiu Xingqiao’s pupils constricted violently as he instantly charged forward to push her out of harm’s way. They tumbled off the road together.\nA large truck whizzed past them. The draft created by the passing vehicle made them break out in cold sweat.\n“Qiu Xingqiao!”\nQiu Tong, who had noticed the commotion, was scared out of her wits. She put everything down and immediately rushed over. “Are you alright?”\nQiu Xingqiao shook his head silently. He immediately looked at the little girl who was in a frightened daze and said angrily, “How could you charge around like that? It’s so dangerous!”\nBut the little girl turned a deaf ear to Qiu Xingqiao’s reprimand. She stared straight at the grains that had been crushed by the truck. Her eyes turned red as she squatted on the ground and wailed incessantly.\nQiu Xingqiao was shocked by her crying and instinctively looked to Qiu Tong for help. “I didn’t bully her!”\nQiu Tong patted Qiu Xingqiao’s head comfortingly. She squatted down and asked the little girl in a gentle tone, “What’s wrong? If you have any problems, you can tell us.. We can help you.”",

      "content": "Chapter 32: Locust Pesticide\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nQiu Xingyuan also brought Qiu Xingyu over.The little girl’s mood became much better on seeing more people of the same age as her, but her face was still filled with sadness.\n“That was my family’s last bit of food.”\nThe little girl sobbed as she spoke. Her family’s harvest today wasn’t good. They didn’t manage to harvest much grain over the whole year either. Nevertheless, they relied on selling their small harvest for a bit of money. But now that the grains were dirty, even their last hope was gone.\nShe was very petite, and her arms were so thin that one could almost feel her bones. Judging from her appearance, she was about the same age as Little Yu, but she was much burdened by hardship.\nQiu Tong’s heart softened. Looking at the crushed grains, she asked, “How much did you plan to sell it for?”\n“$1.”\nThe little girl bit her lips and said timidly. Seeing that Qiu Tong seemed to want to buy it, her big eyes were filled with anticipation.\nHowever, Qiu Tong shook her head.\nThe light in the little girl’s eyes extinguished. But then Qiu Tong said, “I went to check the market price just now. The market price for grains is about $2. I’ll give you $3.”\nShe took the remaining grains from the little girl’s hand and smiled. “I’ll buy the rest.”\n“Really?”\nThe little girl was overjoyed and immediately bowed to Qiu Tong. “Thank you! Thank you!”\nAfter handing the money to the little girl, Qiu Tong looked at the bustling food market and fell into silence.\nThe people who came to sell food in the market were more or less all hardworking people who had labored hard for a year. They had worked so hard for a year in return for just a tiny bit of hope. Meanwhile, the merchants and customers who came to buy food kept trying to depress their prices.\nSome people could not even afford to eat the rice they planted themselves, so they carried their entire harvest over to sell them in exchange for a meager income.\nIf she only cared about storing food for herself and did not care about the lives of these people, when the famine came, the first people to collapse would be these hardworking people struggling on the poverty line.\nBy then, who knew how many people would starve to death in that famine.\nIf Qiu Tong were to make money from their sweat and blood, she would never be able to live with her conscience.\nBut how to avoid this tragedy?\nQiu Tong frowned. As she walked, she suddenly bumped into a little fellow.\nLooking down, she saw Qiu Xingyuan looking at her expressionlessly with a chemistry book in his hand.\nIn that instant, Qiu Tong’s eyes lit up.\nYes, she still had Qiu Xingyuan!\nQiu Tong shared her thoughts.\n“…You want me to develop a pesticide to kill locusts?”\nAfter hearing her words, Qiu Xingyuan frowned slightly, not understanding what Qiu Tong was up to. “There aren’t many locusts now.”\nQiu Tong blabbered nonsense and tried her best to persuade him. “The temperature and humidity is suitable now for locusts to reproduce in large numbers. If a locust plague breaks out, this kind of locust pesticide will come in handy very soon. Not only will we be able to avoid a locust plague, we can also make a huge profit!”\n“No way!”\nQiu Xingyuan flat-out rejected. He felt that Qiu Tong’s worries were groundless. “There hasn’t been a locust plague for more than 10 years. How could it suddenly happen?”\n“Just because it hasn’t happened in over 10 years doesn’t mean it won’t happen.”\nSeeing that Qiu Xingyuan still did not believe her, Qiu Tong had no other choice but to claim. “Actually, I can communicate with spirits. I already foresee a locust plague will happen not long from now.”\nQiu Xingyuan looked at her coldly as if he was looking at a fool.\nQiu Tong suppressed her frustration. An idea popped up in her head. “I can prove it!”\nShe mumbled to herself as she rubbed her fingers. After a while, she opened her eyes and looked at Qiu Xingyuan mysteriously.\n“I’ve calculated it. You’ve been developing a drug that can alleviate the symptoms of people with cardiovascular disease. But you haven’t done any clinical verification yet. You also haven’t found a test subject, right?”\nQiu Xingyuan’s expression suddenly changed.\nQiu Tong was right!\nHe had just started thinking about this idea and had not told anyone. He did not expect Qiu Tong to know.\nThis woman really knew how to tell the future?!\nQiu Tong noted the surprise in his eyes. She looked at him with a smile. “So? Are you willing to save the world with me?”\nQiu Xingyuan scoffed lightly, his gaze still doubtful. “Would you be so kind-hearted?”\n“People can change.”\nIn the end, Qiu Xingyuan could not endure Qiu Tong’s nagging and pestering, so he could only agree to give it a try. Qiu Tong transferred a large sum of money to him. “If you lack anything, just buy it. If it’s not enough, I will continue to sponsor you.”\nQiu Xingyuan paused and looked at her deeply. “Do you really believe that I can do it?”\n“Apart from you, no one else in this world can develop it.”\nQiu Tong patted his shoulder.\nQiu Xingyuan pursed his lips, not understanding why Qiu Tong was so confident that he could succeed.\nHowever, this feeling of being trusted was not bad.\nQiu Xingyuan originally intended to make a half-hearted attempt just to keep Qiu Tong off his back. But she repeatedly asked about his progress. Annoyed, he had no choice but to go out with a gloomy face to purchase the required materials.\nHe must be mad to go along with that woman’s crazy scheme.\nAs he passed by an alley not far from his residence, a figure suddenly blocked his path.",

He wandered around for a few days, but didn’t see Qiu Tong at all.\nHe narrowed his eyes and sized up the child who only came up to his lower belly. A dangerous glint flashed across his eyes.\nHe recognized him. It was this little brat who caused his face and body to itch for several days!\n“Where’s Qiu Tong?”\nQiu Xingyuan glared at him warily. His small body retreated a few steps back, trying to find a way to escape.\n“She won’t see you!”\n“Bullsh*t! If it weren’t for you three brats, Qiu Tong and I wouldn’t have fallen out!”\nThe more Yu Ge thought about it, the more indignant he became. If these three little brats had disappeared sooner, he would have already gotten Qiu Tong and all her money would have been his!\nHis gaze fell upon the school bag on Qiu Xingyuan’s back. Yu Ge smirked. “What’s in your bag?”\nQiu Xingyuan suddenly felt uneasy and turned to run.\nHe had only taken a few steps when someone grabbed his collar roughly and flung him to the side. His bag was also snatched away.\n“So much money?”\nYu Ge’s eyes lit up!\nQiu Xingyuan gritted his teeth and pounced over, his little face filled with anger. “Give it back to me!”\nYu Ge kicked him away impatiently. There was a thick wad of cash. There must be at least a few thousand dollars here.\nQiu Tong was indeed rich now if she could give her child so much money!\nYu Ge’s eyes were filled with greed. He stuffed the money into his pocket and warned Qiu Xingyuan fiercely, “If you dare to tell anyone about what happened today, not only will I kill you, I will also kill the other two brats!”\nQiu Xingyuan lowered his eyes coldly and clenched his fists tightly.\nIt was only when Yu Ge left that he slowly got up from the ground. But all the money had been snatched away.\nQiu Tong’s eager expression appeared in his mind. Qiu Xingyuan pursed his lips even tighter.\nSomehow, he didn’t want to disappoint that woman.\nHe must find a way to come up with that money!\nIn the evening, at the underground market.\nAn inconspicuous little figure sneaked into the shooting range and quickly squatted down to stuff the scattered bullet shells into his bag.\nPreviously when they had lived in slums, there were all sorts of people there. It was there that Qiu Xingyuan knew that bullets were very expensive.\nHe had already grasped the theoretical knowledge of making gunpowder. As long as he had bullet shells, he would be able to quickly produce a large number of bullets to sell. He would be able to earn back that money then!\nAfter some time, Qiu Xingyuan returned to the laboratory specially prepared for him by Qiu Tong and very carefully inserted a pile of gunpowder into the metal bullet shell.\nSuccess!\nJoy and confidence flashed across Qiu Xingyuan’s eyes as he sped up. After about 40 minutes, he was exhausted. His fingers trembled slightly as he brought the lamp to the side. The lamp contained alcohol.\nOh no!\nQiu Xingyuan widened his eyes in horror. Before he could react, he felt a pain in his hands and heard a familiar voice. Then, he was pulled into a soft and warm embrace.\n“Be careful!”\n“Boom——”\nThe violent explosion instantly shattered the utensils in the room into pieces, while Qiu Tong covered Qiu Xingyuan with her body, pressing him tightly onto the floor. Qiu Xingyuan did not suffer the slightest impact.\n“Are you hurt anywhere?”\nQiu Tong checked Qiu Xingyuan up and down nervously. When she found that there were no injuries, she became furious. “Are you crazy? Who told you to research explosives?”\nFrom the corner of her eye, she saw a pile of dark gold bullet heads in the corner. Qiu Tong’s eyes turned cold and her anger surged. “Qiu Xingyuan! Why did you make so many bullets?”\nQiu Xingyuan lowered his head and did not explain. As usual, he bore everything in silence.\n“Do you know how dangerous it was just now? What if you hurt yourself?!”\nSeeing that he was still unwilling to explain, Qiu Tong was truly angered now. She really felt like prying Qiu Xingyuan’s head open to see what he was thinking.\n“I won’t hurt myself.”\nQiu Xingyuan twisted his fingers awkwardly, his little face tense. “It was just an accident.”\nSeeing that Qiu Tong was still glaring at him coldly, Qiu Xingyuan lowered his eyes and casually found an excuse. “Anyway, I still have so much explosives and no use for them. Might as well just make bullets.”\nShe noticed his tightly pursed lips. Qiu Tong knew that he had a secret and did not press him further. She changed the topic.\n“How can there be no use for them? Let me teach you.”\nShe rolled up her sleeves and gestured for Qiu Xingyuan to pay attention to her process and the exact ratio of gunpowder to use. Unknowingly, the two of them had been in the laboratory for the entire afternoon.\nQiu Xingyuan did not understand what she wanted to do.\nAt night, Qiu Tong sneaked out with her three children.\n“Mommy, Eldest Brother, what are you two doing?”\nQiu Xingyu looked at them in confusion and Qiu Tong said mysteriously, “Mommy and Eldest Brother have prepared a gift for you!”\nAfter about three minutes had passed, Qiu Tong asked them to look up at the night sky. “Look!”\nColorful fireworks instantly lit up the night sky like a grand and festive bouquet of flowers. Every moment was astonishing.\nEven Qiu Xingyuan, who had helped to create them, was shocked by the scene before him.\nSo… she was making fireworks this afternoon?",

I love this gift!”\nQiu Xingyu shrieked in amazement.\nQiu Tong gave a smug smile and glanced at Qiu Xingyuan, who was also looking at the sky. She said meaningfully, “You should be seeing such beautiful things at your age. Leave the rest to Mommy. You don’t have to worry.”\nShe smiled and touched Qiu Xingyuan’s head. The boy, who had always been gloomy and cold, looked at her blankly as if he didn’t recognize her.\nQiu Tong felt that Qiu Xingyuan seemed to have relaxed a little.\nAs expected, in the next second, Qiu Xingyuan said in a low voice, “Someone snatched away the money for the locust pesticide. It was Yu Ge.”\nThat wretched man again?!\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes and gritted her teeth in anger.\nHe did not even let a child off. He was indeed a scumbag with no conscience!\nWell then, don’t blame her for enforcing justice on behalf of the heavens!\nThe three children were in a good mood the next day after witnessing the stunning “fireworks show”.\n“You have a mother but no father!”\n“It must be because you kids are too naughty. That’s why your father doesn’t want you all.”\nThose words that had formerly angered the three children had no effect on them now.\nQiu Xingqiao even took out an item proudly and shouted, “What’s so great about having a father? I have this!”\nThe item in his hand immediately attracted the attention of all the children. Qiu Xingqiao became even more pleased when he realized that he had become the center of attention.\nHe proudly showed off his fireworks. The red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple colors instantly made everyone gasp in surprise.\nThis was an improved version made overnight by Qiu Tong and Qiu Xingyuan. It was convenient to carry around, and it was even more beautiful.\n“Qiu Xingqiao, do you have more?”\nSome children were extremely envious and approached Qiu Xingqiao in an adoring manner. Not to be outdone, some other children clamored to barter with Qiu Xingqiao. Some even wanted to buy fireworks from him.\nThe children crowded around Qiu Xingqiao so tightly that not even a drop of water could pass through. Finally, he could not take it anymore and shouted, “My brother and sister also have it!”\nCompared to the pathetic Qiu Xingqiao, Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingyu were already well-prepared. They exchanged their fireworks for money in an orderly manner.\nSoon, the three children became the top dogs of the kindergarten and were much-adored by the other children.\nWhile the three children were in kindergarten, Qiu Tong dragged Yu Ge out of her handphone blacklist with a cold face.\n“Where are you?”\nQiu Tong asked coldly, ignoring the clamor in front of her.\nYu Ge seemed to have expected Qiu Tong to look for him. His tone was filled with confidence and pride. “I’m at the Imperial Casino.”\nAfter getting his location, Qiu Tong rushed over within ten minutes. From afar, she saw that Yu Ge’s eyes were already bloodshot from gambling. As soon as he saw her, he immediately rushed over. “Qiu Tong, give me another $15,000! I only need $15,000 and I’ll definitely be able to make a comeback!”\n“When will you return the $20,000 that you already owe me?”\nQiu Tong glared at him coldly and Yu Ge avoided her gaze. “Since when did I borrow money from you? Don’t slander me!”\nQiu Tong sneered. “You even dare to snatch money from a child? Robbing a child? Yu Ge, are you that shameless?!”\nHaving been exposed by Qiu Tong in front of so many people, Yu Ge’s face flushed red. He glared at her with bulging eyes. “Don’t spout nonsense, you’re slandering me! Qiu Tong, never mind that you are always clinging onto me, now you are slandering me! You love me so much that it has turned to hate!”\nHe charged at her, wanting to chase Qiu Tong out.\nQiu Tong’s eyes turned cold as she lifted her leg and kicked Yu Ge in the stomach. The 1.8-meter tall man was sent flying across the air before falling to the ground with a thud, unable to get up.\n“Are you going to return my money?”\nQiu Tong looked down at Yu Ge, who was groaning in pain. Yu Ge gritted his teeth and refused to admit it. “I don’t owe you any money!”\nHe would not repent until he saw his own grave!\nShe took up a fruit knife from the fruit platter and smiled at Yu Ge. “It’s fine if you don’t want to pay me back. I will charge you $1,000 per finger. But it looks like your pair of hands won’t be enough. Never mind, we can include your feet!”\nThe cold glint of the blade made Yu Ge nervous, but he was betting that Qiu Tong would not dare to make a move.\n“How dare you?! I will call the police!”\nHa!\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes and raised her hand, before stabbing downwards.\n“Ah!”\nYu Ge shut his eyes and screamed. He had not expected Qiu Tong to actually dare to attack him. He was feeling deep remorse now.\n“I’ll return you money, I’ll return it right now!”\n“You should have just done so earlier.”\nQiu Tong let go of him. Yu Ge then realized that the knife had landed between his fingers. He collapsed weakly to the ground.\n“This is all the money I have.”\nYu Ge’s hands trembled as he handed about $1,000 in cash over to Qiu Tong. Seeing that Qiu Tong looked unsatisfied, his legs trembled. “I really don’t have any money left… I lost all my money…”\nSeeing that he was not pretending, Qiu Tong gave a light snort. Her gaze landed on the gambling table.\n“Move aside!”\nShe motioned for Yu Ge to get lost while she took his place.. She looked at the betting table before her with interest.",

      "content": "Chapter 35: Cheating\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nIt was a simple betting game based on the number of the dice rolled: “Big” or “Small”. However, Yu Ge never won a single round and lost all his money.\nYu Ge’s luck was just too lousy. But there were actually some intricacies to this betting game.\nWith a twitch of her ears, Qiu Tong pushed all her money to “Small”. When the dice were revealed, there were indeed just four dots!\nQiu Tong smirked. She had already grasped the trick to this game.\nAfter that, it was as if she was cheating. With her sharp senses, Qiu Tong won nearly every bet. The rest of the gamblers immediately followed her bets. Soon, the casino lost close to $15,000.\nIn just three hours, she had increased the original $1,000 by more than 50 times.\nSatisfied, Qiu Tong was ready to leave the table. But the casino dealer had lost so terribly that he pointed at Qiu Tong with bloodshot eyes. “She cheated!”\nThe grim-faced boss was also standing at the side. He looked at Qiu Tong coldly. “Hand over the money!”\n“Winning equals cheating?”\nQiu Tong was certain that there was something wrong with this casino. Cold amusement flashed across her eyes. Ignoring her comment, the boss gave a wave of his hand. More than 10 men charged toward Qiu Tong!\nQiu Tong did not wish to get entangled in a prolonged fight. Stepping off the gambling table beside her, she leaped into the air and threw consequent kicks at several of the bodyguards. Before anyone could react, she fled.\n“Chase after her!”\nThe boss was so angry that his face turned ashen. He glared at Yu Ge coldly and ordered his men to drag him over. “Is she your woman?”\n“No… no…”\nYu Ge was so frightened that his face turned pale. However, the casino owner, who had suffered heavy losses, refused to listen to his explanation.\n“You are to return all my money within three days. Otherwise—”\n“Crash!”\nAn axe split a chair in half with a heavy blow.\nYu Ge collapsed to the ground. With a pale face, he raised his hands and swore. “Of course! I’ll return it! I’ll definitely make Qiu Tong cough up the money!”\nAfter winning so much money, Qiu Tong went to the kindergarten to pick up the three kids.\n“Mommy!”\nAs soon as Qiu Xingyu saw her, she rushed over with her small school bag, her eyes sparkling. “I made many new friends today.”\nAlthough Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao did not say anything, their faces also looked lighter and more relaxed.\nThe three children were more mature than their peers, but they were still kids after all. Due to their family background, it had been a long time since other children were willing to play with them.\n“You are so cute, other children will definitely like you.”\nIt was rare to see the three brats in a good mood, and Qiu Tong’s smile grew wider.\nShe had worked hard for so long, all for the sake of letting these three children start a new life and grow up healthy and happy, just like ordinary children.\nJust as she was about to bring the three children home, Yu Ge, who had been secretly following behind her, suddenly rushed out and grabbed Qiu Tong’s arm.\n“Everyone, come and be my judges. I’m the father of these three children! But this woman refused to let me see the children just to get back at me!”\n“Children, I’m your father!”\nYu Ge rushed towards the three children, but Qiu Tong pushed him away forcefully, her eyes wary. “What do you want?!”\nYu Ge pretended to stagger backwards and collapsed to the ground in an exaggerated manner. His face was full of tears and snot.\n“This woman is so selfish and ruthless! I’m the father of these children. But not only did she take all my money, she refused to let them acknowledge me!”\nYu Ge’s ruckus at the entrance of the kindergarten soon attracted the attention of the other parents. Everyone looked at Qiu Tong strangely and whispered among themselves.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao’s faces were cold. Qiu Xingyu pursed her lips tightly and hid behind her two brothers in fear.\nThey did not believe that this man was their father.\n“Yu Ge, you are truly unrepentant!”\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes dangerously and glared at him. “You’re not the children’s father!”\n“Then tell me, who is the father of the children?!”\nYu Ge asked in a harsh tone. Qiu Tong was speechless.\nShe had no memories of the children’s father, so how would she know who their father was?\nSeeing that she couldn’t say anything, Yu Ge’s lips curled into a quick smile. He quickly pulled the people around him to complain. “I worked so hard for the four of them, but this woman found another man and even brought the three children away with her!”\n“Those three ingrates refused to acknowledge me when they saw that I had no money…”\nThe more Yu Ge spoke, the more exaggerated he became. Qiu Tong was furious and was about to teach him a lesson when a teacher hurried over to disperse the surrounding parents.\n“Mother Qiu, is he really the children’s father?”\nThe teacher approached Qiu Tong with small, cautious steps. Qiu Tong immediately denied, “Of course not.”\n“If you don’t admit it, we’ll do a paternity test now!”\nYu Ge got up from the ground and said confidently, “How can I possibly not recognize my own children?”\nThe other parents agreed.. “That’s right, Mother Qiu. Why don’t you do a paternity test? Wouldn’t everything be clear then?”",

She looked away coldly. “There’s no need. I know very well who the children’s father is.”\n“If you know, why are you refusing to say?!”\nYu Ge refused to let it go but kept interrogating her. “You are just feeling guilty, so you don’t dare to do a paternity test!”\nThe teacher continued to persuade her, “It’s better to do one. Otherwise, if this father keeps making a fuss at the entrance of the kindergarten, it won’t be good for the children.”\nHearing the teacher’s subtle hint, Qiu Tong lowered her eyes and finally chose to compromise.\nQiu Tong brought the three children to the hospital and drew their blood. They sat on the hospital bench and waited for the results.\nLittle Yu was a little nervous. She whispered to her two brothers, “Will he turn out to be our Daddy?”\n“No way!”\nQiu Xingqiao blurted out angrily, while Qiu Xingyuan remained silent with a cold face, but his eyes were filled with denial.\nHalf an hour later, the report was finally out.\nQiu Tong took it and her attention was drawn to the last line—\nIt had been determined that Qiu Xingyuan, Qiu Xingqiao and Qiu Xingyu were 99.99% related to Yu Ge.\nYu Ge was really the father of three children?!\nQiu Tong’s eyes widened, and Yu Ge, who had seen the result, smiled smugly.\n“Qiu Tong, what else do you have to say?!”\nHe pointed at the last line of the report and said in a malicious tone, “It’s written clearly in black and white that I’m the children’s biological father!”\nQiu Tong looked at him coldly and said nothing.\nThe three children’s faces darkened as they clenched their fists.\n“What do you want?”\nWasn’t Yu Ge here just for money?\nQiu Tong pursed her lips and asked coldly, “How much do you want?”\n“$300,000!”\nYu Ge immediately demanded an exorbitant sum. His eyes sparkled. “In addition, you have to transfer the ownership of the apartment to me!”\nQiu Tong almost burst out laughing at Yu Ge’s shamelessness. She had worked so hard just to scrape together $150,000, and Yu Ge was now asking for $300,000?\n“Yu Ge, you should know your limits. Otherwise, you won’t get anything in the end!”\nNow that Yu Ge had something to fall back on, he was not afraid of Qiu Tong’s threat. His tone was exceptionally harsh. “Stop scaring me, Qiu Tong. If you don’t agree, I will immediately sue the court and fight for custody as their biological father!”\n“Go ahead.”\nQiu Tong stood up coldly. She no longer wished to entertain his silly mind games. There must be something wrong with that report. She had to find out the truth immediately!\nSeeing that she was about to leave, Yu Ge hurriedly stopped her. “You can’t leave!”\n“I’m the children’s father. What right do you have to take the children away?! Give me the money or give me the children!”\nHe clung onto Qiu Tong, refusing to let them leave. His noisy actions attracted the attention of countless people in the hospital.\nQiu Tong couldn’t bear it anymore. She grabbed Yu Ge by the collar and dragged him out of the hospital. Her tone was vicious. “Yu Ge, you better not have been up to any tricks, or I will never let you off!”\nLeaving Yu Ge at the door, Qiu Tong immediately took the children home in a taxi.\n“Little Yu, lend me your computer.”\nAs soon as she got home, Qiu Tong rushed into her room and started working on the computer with a serious look on her face.\nThe three children did not dare to disturb her and waited quietly in the living room. Qiu Xingyu tugged her skirt nervously. “Did the paternity test state that he is our father?”\n“No way!”\nQiu Xingqiao clenched his fists, his little face flushed red. “I don’t have a father like that!”\n“What if he really wants to snatch us away from mommy?”\nQiu Xingyu could not hide her worry. Qiu Xingqiao’s face was pale, and for a moment, he did not know how to answer. He looked to Qiu Xingyuan for help.\nQiu Xingyuan’s eyes were cold, and his tone was chilly. “If he really dares to come for us, I will deliberately injure myself! As long as I can prove that Yu Ge was negligent and caused me to be injured, the court will strip him of his custody!”\nQiu Xingqiao’s eyes lit up. “Alright, my skin is thick and I’m not afraid of pain. Let me do it!”\nThe three brats muttered in the living room while Qiu Tong quickly hacked into the hospital’s medical system and immediately found today’s DNA test report.\nQiu Tong sneered when she saw the figure “0.99%” under the possibility section.\nShe knew that Yu Ge must have done something.\nTo prevent Yu Ge from colluding with the hospital to destroy the report, Qiu Tong quickly downloaded the original and even printed it out.\nSeeing the three kids staring at her nervously, Qiu Tong smiled.\n“Don’t worry, he’s not your father. I’m foolish but not that foolish.”\nThe three children, who were all tensed up, instantly heaved a sigh of relief. Qiu Xingqiao regained his lively and active appearance. He stuck his hands at his waist and laughed arrogantly. “How can that kind of coward be worthy of being my father?!”\nQiu Xingyuan’s expression was still cold and stern as he frowned slightly.. “He won’t give up so easily.”",

She hugged them comfortingly, her tone exceptionally firm.\n“No matter what he does, I will never let him take you away from me!”\nQiu Xingyu leaned against Qiu Tong and nodded vigorously. “I don’t want to leave Mommy either.”\nThe next day, a court summons was sent to Qiu Tong.\nYu Ge had really gone to court to sue Qiu Tong for custody!\nQiu Tong smirked as she gazed coldly at the date and venue of the trial.\nYu Ge was certain that she would not be able to get the original report and wanted to use the fake report to fool the court. Well then, she would play his game!\nAfter sending the three children to kindergarten, Qiu Tong brought the original report to the court on time.\nYu Ge had already arrived with his lawyer.\n“Qiu Tong, it’s not too late to regret now.”\nYu Ge narrowed his eyes as he urged Qiu Tong. “It’s just $300,000. Money can be earned anytime.”\nQiu Tong completely ignored him and walked straight to the defendant’s seat and sat quietly.\nYu Ge thought that she had already given up. He secretly cursed in his heart.\nWhat was the use of having the children? He wanted money!\nHowever, he immediately thought of something. As long as the three children were in his hands, he need not fear that Qiu Tong wouldn’t fork out any money.\n“Thump!”\nThe chief judge lightly knocked on his wooden hammer. The detailed report of the case was laid out in front of him. He said in a deep voice, “Plaintiff, make your statement.”\nYu Ge’s lawyer stood up and looked at Qiu Tong coldly. “Ms. Qiu, do you admit to refusing to let my client have contact with his children?”\n“As the children’s biological father, my client has the right to visit the children. Just because of a conflict between adults, you purposely let the children live in an unhealthy family environment. Your way of thinking and emotional state are very dangerous. You are completely unsuitable to continue being the guardian of the three children!”\nQiu Tong smirked. “And Yu Ge isn’t dangerous? He tried to sell the three children and even robbed the eldest child of his money. He likes to gamble. How is he fit to be a father?”\n“Since he’s the biological father, may I ask if he has ever spared a single cent on child support?”\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes and said in a mocking tone, “This ‘good father’ would rather receive $300,000 and wash his hands off his children. He’s only using this custody battle to blackmail me into giving him money! From a legal perspective, this is a scam!”\n“You’re slandering me!”\nYu Ge was instantly enraged. He had nothing. At most, he would just lose the lawsuit. So he lied for all he was worth. “You cheated me of all my money. How would I have money to pay for child support?”\n“No money?”\nQiu Tong sneered. “If you don’t have money, why did you go to the Imperial Casino?”\nYu Ge was at a loss for words as panic flashed across his eyes.\n“You forced me to do that. Qiu Tong, you snatched my children away and made me homeless. I had no choice but to stay in those places!”\nQiu Tong raised an eyebrow and turned to the judge again. “How can such a person ensure the children’s daily living conditions and studies when he doesn’t even have a place to stay or a stable job?”\n“Therefore, I request to reject the other party’s request.”\nYu Ge did not expect Qiu Tong to react so quickly and catch on to his shortcomings. He immediately tried to salvage the situation. “I already have a place to live and a job. Since I’m the children’s father, shouldn’t you at least give me one of the three children?”\n“Yu Ge, I’ll give you one more chance.”\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes slowly and said in a strange tone, “If you stop now, there’s still room for reconciliation.”\nYu Ge thought that Qiu Tong was afraid, so he became even more arrogant. “Judge, I can choose not to fight for all three children. Just one will do!”\nSeeing his stubbornness, Qiu Tong no longer held back but took out the report she had prepared.\n“It’s just that I retrieved the original report from the hospital. Yu Ge is not my children’s father at all! In order to extort money from me, he deliberately forged the report and pretended to be my children’s father. He then tried to swindle me of $300,000 and the children’s custody!”\nQiu Tong handed over another petition and said coldly, “I’m suing Yu Ge for extortion and blackmail!”\nYu Ge’s lawyer was stunned by the sudden turn of events.\nYu Ge lost his composure and rushed over, wanting to snatch the report from Qiu Tong’s hands. “It’s fake! Hers is the fake one!”\nQiu Tong easily dodged and handed all the documents over to the judge. The judge called the appraiser over and carefully compared them before shooting a cold glare at Yu Ge.\n“Extortion, blackmail, falsifying a report, how dare you!”\nOh no!\nYu Ge’s legs gave way, and he sat paralyzed on the plaintiff’s seat. His lawyer, on the other hand, did not dare to say a word. Now, he wanted nothing more than to draw a clear line between them.\nIn the end, Yu Ge suffered the consequences of his own actions and was sentenced to three months in prison.\nQiu Tong watched with satisfaction as Yu Ge was arrested.. Then, she slowly walked home.",

With a smile on his cold and stern face, he said, “I’m sorry to have kept you waiting, Commander Shao.”\n“No problem.”\nShao An narrowed his eyes and retracted his gaze from the court. He sent the video he had just taken to his boss and smirked.\nHis boss would definitely be pleased to see this.\nAfter Jin Yang received the video, he looked at Qiu Tong, who was valiant and cool, neither timid nor overbearing. Every word she said made sense. A smile flashed across his eyes.\nHaving finally gotten rid of Yu Ge, that disgusting man, Qiu Tong was in a good mood and prepared to tell the three children the good news.\nHowever, when she rushed to the kindergarten, she realized that most of the children had left. There was no sign of her three brats.\nShe stopped the teacher curiously. “Teacher, where’s my children?”\n“The children left a long time ago.”\nThe teacher looked at her strangely and said hesitantly, “Little Yu said that you had something important to do today and couldn’t come. She requested for them to go home by themselves. The three children have been gone for nearly 40 minutes.”\nBut she did not see the three children on her way here.\nQiu Tong left the teacher in a hurry. She searched through all the parks and amusement centers nearby but could not find them.\nThe three children were young and mischievous, but they wouldn’t do such a thing. Did something happen?\nWith her heart thumping in anxiety, Qiu Tong immediately went into the nearest internet cafe and hacked into the surveillance cameras. She could vaguely see the three children leaving the kindergarten before disappearing without a trace.\nQiu Tong was unwilling to give up. She studied the surveillance footage for several hours, but to no avail.\nCould it be that the three children had purposely travelled along the surveillance blind spots?\nUnable to find any trace of the children, Qiu Tong rushed home with a sullen expression, wanting to see if the children had gone home on their own.\nThe moment she entered, she realized that the house was quiet.\nQiu Tong’s eyes darkened and she instinctively lightened her footsteps. Suddenly, she felt a gust of wind behind her. She turned around and dodged nimbly, grabbing the wooden stick that was swinging at her.\n“Qiu Xingqiao?”\nQiu Xingqiao saw who it was and his eyes turned red. “Why are you back so late?”\n“What’s going on?”\nQiu Tong squatted down and hugged him tightly. “Where are your siblings?”\n“They…”\nQiu Xingqiao sniffed and said in a choked voice, “They were taken away by human traffickers!”\nAfter Qiu Xingyuan and the rest left the kindergarten, they had just walked to the alley near the district when a large group of people suddenly rushed out from a van parked by the roadside. They gagged their mouths and dragged them towards the van.\nFortunately, Qiu Xingqiao had good stamina and could fight. He bit hard on those people’s hands and took advantage of their pain to break free and hurriedly escape.\nThe little fellow was in low spirits and felt very guilty. “I didn’t protect my siblings.”\n“No, you did very well.”\nQiu Tong’s tone was gentle as she comforted Qiu Xingqiao. “You’re very smart and brave. If you hadn’t come back to tell me, Mommy would never have found you.”\n“It is only because of you that your siblings have hope of finding their way home.”\nQiu Xingqiao, who was still upset about being a deserter, looked up and asked with a hint of uncertainty, “Really?”\nSeeing Qiu Tong nod her head affirmatively, Qiu Xingqiao’s expression became better. He stared at Qiu Tong. “You must save them and beat up the bad guys!”\nQiu Tong did not say anything. She hooked his little finger with her own and said in a low voice, “If you have any problems, you have to seek out the police to help you.”\nQiu Xingqiao was already violent enough. She could not let him get used to solving problems with brute force.\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes dangerously. Nevertheless, she could still beat those people up before she called the police.\nWho would want to kidnap the three children?\nThey had no money and they had not offended anyone. Qiu Tong suspected that it might be Yu Ge, but then she soon dispelled that notion.\nNot only was Yu Ge currently locked up in jail, his only goal was money. He would not attack the children.\nQiu Tong was deep in thought when she suddenly remembered someone else.\nLin Shan!\nPreviously, the former Qiu Tong was bewitched by her into selling the children. Lin Shan had even tried to set a trap to continue deceiving her into selling her children.\nOther than her and that Mr. Cui, no one would target her three children!\nQiu Tong’s eyes turned cold. She immediately took a taxi to Lin Shan’s place and knocked on the door.\n“Who is it?!”\nAn impatient voice came from inside. When she saw that it was Qiu Tong, Lin Shan’s expression changed and she instinctively wanted to close the door.\nQiu Tong kicked the door open and stormed in. She scanned the room but did not see the children.\nHer cold gaze slowly shifted to Lin Shan.. Qiu Tong’s tone was cold, and her eyes swirled with mad anger, as if filled with the aura of death and hell. “Where are my children?”",

Why are you here?”\nQiu Tong could not be bothered with her. Ignoring her attempts to obstruct her, she forced her way in and opened all the doors. But they were empty.\nNot only was there no sign of the children, even Mr. Cui was gone.\nQiu Tong frowned and glared at Lin Shan. “Where did Mr. Cui go?”\n“Qiu Tong, what do you mean?”\nLin Shan put on a brave front and pointed at Qiu Tong with her hands on her hips. “You treated me so badly before, but you have the cheek to turn up at my door now? You already know my relationship with Mr. Cui. Why do you care where Mr. Cui went? What are your intentions?”\nQiu Tong’s patience ran out and she glared at her coldly. “I’m asking you one last time, where did Mr. Cui go?”\nLin Shan shivered under her merciless gaze, but she still braced herself and said, “Are you shameless? You want to seduce Mr. Cui… Ah!”\nA strong force gripped her throat tightly. Qiu Tong looked at her with an especially cold gaze, her valiant face suffused with a thick murderous aura.\n“Where is he?”\nLin Shan was so scared that her lips were trembling. She was hesitating whether she should say it or not, but in that moment of hesitation, the hand at her throat suddenly contracted, and she was unable to breathe.\n“Cough cough…”\nHer face turned purple as she tried her best to grab Qiu Tong’s fingers. However, Qiu Tong’s hands were like iron pincers, and she could not pry them apart. Just as she thought she was about to suffocate, Qiu Tong suddenly released her hands.\nLin Shan coughed so hard that her face turned red. She looked at Qiu Tong with fear.\n“Next time, I won’t let go.”\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes and asked coldly, “Where is Mr. Cui?”\n“I really don’t know!”\nLin Shan’s voice was thick with tears. She covered her neck and shrank back desperately. “He only said he was going out to do something. I don’t know where he went!”\n“Call him.”\nQiu Tong took a fruit knife from the kitchen and forced Lin Shan to call Mr. Cui. “Speak normally. If you try anything funny…”\nShe pressed the knife hard against Lin Shan’s neck. Lin Shan nodded repeatedly with a pale face.\nQiu Tong took Lin Shan’s phone and easily cracked her password. She gestured for her to make the call.\nIt rang for a long time before Mr. Cui finally answered the call. His tone was extremely impatient. “What is it this time?”\n“Are you coming over tonight?”\nLin Shan looked at the knife by her neck and tried her best not to tremble. “My mom called me and asked when we’re getting married…”\nMr. Cui interrupted her impatiently. “Didn’t I tell you that we will talk about this next time? I have something important to do now. Don’t bother me!”\n“Wait, where are you? If it’s not convenient for you to come over, I can come to you!”\nLin Shan quickly stopped him. Mr. Cui made some vague replies but did not give her an exact location. He then hurriedly hung up.\nShe looked at Qiu Tong in fear and was about to cry. “I tried my best but he didn’t want to tell me…”\nQiu Tong had successfully hacked into Mr. Cui’s phone during the call and located his location.\nHer eyes were fixed on the flashing red dot on the screen. She stared coldly at Lin Shan. “I’ll settle our scores next time!”\nIgnoring Lin Shan’s horrified expression, Qiu Tong immediately zoomed in on the flashing red dot on the screen and was shocked to discover that it was in a high-end villa compound.\nThere was a high chance that the children were also brought there!\nQiu Tong returned home and gathered some items. Just as she was about to leave, Qiu Xingqiao stubbornly wanted to follow her. “I want to go too!”\nHis small face was full of determination. Qiu Tong knew that if she did not bring him along, Qiu Xingqiao would just charge on alone. She might as well keep him by her side.\nAs the two of them approached the entrance of the villa compound, they were stopped by the security guards.\n“Who are you?”\nHe looked at Qiu Tong and Qiu Xingqiao warily. “Do you have an invitation? If not, you can’t enter!”\nQiu Tong was about to explain when she saw a figure walking towards her from the corner of her eye. She hurriedly pulled Qiu Xingqiao and hid in the bushes.\nAfter a while, Mr. Cui appeared with a card in his hand, humming. He seemed to be in a good mood.\nQiu Tong’s eyes darkened. It seemed like the children had been brought here and sold to someone inside!",

She successfully hacked into the security system and closed all the intruder warning devices.\nCarefully avoiding the security guards, she then successfully sneaked into the villa compound with Qiu Xingqiao.\nQiu Xingqiao followed Qiu Tong closely, as if she was his pillar.\n“Where are we going now?”\n“No rush.”\nUsing her handphone, Qiu Tong hacked into the surveillance system. She scrolled through all the surveillance records of the perimeter of the compound and the parking lot, before finally finding Mr. Cui.\nHe had parked his car on the basement floor, and then jogged towards one of the innermost villas.\nQiu Tong nodded slightly at Qiu Xingqiao, indicating for him to follow.\nShe had Qiu Xingqiao hide in the bushes while she climbed up a banyan tree at the perimeter of the villa. Her body was as light as a cat’s as she quietly sneaked into the second-floor balcony.\nThrough the glass doors of the balcony, she suddenly saw Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingyu locked up in this room.\nQiu Tong was just about to make a move when she saw someone enter and quickly hid at the side.\nThe glass was soundproof, and Qiu Tong could not hear the conversation inside. However, it was clear that the other party had not mistreated the two children. Not only had they been provided with food, they were also given fruits and children’s books.\nSeeing that the two children were well taken care of and not abused, Qiu Tong heaved a sigh of relief.\nThere were so many security guards outside and it was broad daylight. It would be very difficult for her to bring the two children along with her now.\nBut if they waited until it was nighttime, they could escape more easily under the cover of darkness.\nQiu Tong decided to wait until nightfall before taking action. She returned to Qiu Xingqiao’s side.\n“Did you find them?”\nQiu Xingqiao was burning with anxiety. Seeing Qiu Tong nod her head, his eyes went red with determination. “Then let’s rescue them quickly!”\nQiu Tong didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. She grabbed his collar and said, “It’s not convenient to make our move now. Wait for the sky to turn dark.”\n“I’m going to find out who the owner of this villa is. Wait for me here and don’t run around.”\nQiu Xingqiao nodded obediently. After settling him down, Qiu Tong went back into the security system and secretly hacked all the surveillance cameras around the villa in the southeast corner.\nShe leaped onto the balcony again and rolled onto the ground. She noticed that the window of the study was open.\nQiu Tong surveyed her surroundings warily. When she realized that no one was around, she supported herself with one hand on the balcony and leaped forward into the study. She landed lightly without making a sound.\nHer sharp gaze swept across the decorations in the study room inch by inch, instantly taking in the wall full of medals and trophies. There was even a military uniform hanging on the clothes rack beside it.\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes and examined each medal carefully. It was then that she realized that the owner of the villa was actually a first lieutenant of the country!\nWhy would a person of such status spend so much effort to capture two children?\nQiu Tong was confused. When she approached the desk, there was a document on it!\nThe document contained the order to capture Qiu Xingyuan, Qiu Xingqiao and Qiu Xingyu with all means necessary. Furthermore, it was covered with a red seal. This meant that it was an official document of the highest grade level.\nIn other words, the person who issued this order was someone of an even higher status than a first lieutenant!\nQiu Tong was secretly shocked. She did not expect this matter to be so complicated.\nJust as she was about to investigate further, she heard hasty footsteps coming from the corridor outside. She also heard a low voice.\n“Our esteemed guest has arrived.”\nA deep and heavy voice rang out. It should be the first lieutenant’s voice. “Send the children upstairs first.”\nMore footsteps.\nWhen it was quiet outside, Qiu Tong slowly approached the door and opened it slightly.\nA broad middle-aged man’s back flashed past the stairs. He seemed to have gone downstairs to welcome the mysterious guest.\nQiu Tong could not help but hold her breath. With a single leap of her long legs, she successfully sneaked into another room and could see everything that was happening downstairs.\nQiu Tong quietly opened the blinds and stared at the door.\nNot long after, an extremely familiar face strode in from outside.\nQiu Tong gasped.\nThis man… how could it be him?!",

He looked up and asked with a cold gaze, “Do I need to ask for your permission before coming here?”\nAs he narrowed his eyes, the tea lid made a clear, clinking sound, startling the lieutenant so much that his face paled as he shook his head.\nQiu Tong pushed at the gap in the glass window, trying to hear their conversation more clearly.\nBang!\nSmack!\nSounds of something breaking in the room above rang out followed by hurried footsteps. The villa then suddenly returned to silence.\nJin Yang looked up at the lieutenant. “You have guests?”\nThe burly officer was a little flustered, but he did his best to conceal the presence of the children. He forced a stiff smile and said, “I just got a couple of new pets. Perhaps they are not used to the strange environment here. Sorry to have disturbed you, Sir.”\nJin Yang smiled. “Oh? What kind of pets? Can I see them?”\nThe lieutenant immediately stopped him and said, “They have not been tamed yet. I’m afraid they might harm you! It will be better to see them after I finish taming them.”\nQiu Tong listened to their conversation, her eyes filled with confusion.\nFrom the looks of it, Song Yan didn’t seem to know the children’s situation. Could it really be just a coincidence?\nWhile they were talking downstairs, she sneaked away and waited for an opportunity to rescue Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingyu.\nIn the room, the two children were not idle either.\nQiu Xingyuan used his body to block the bodyguard’s line of sight. He took out two pills and passed them to Qiu Xingyu. With a vigilant and anxious look, he said, “Little Yu, eat this antidote. Brother will bring you out!”\nHis expression was cold and calm as he tried his best to suppress the nervousness in his heart. He had already planned his escape route. He had to escape with his sister!\nDid Qiu Xingqiao tell that woman that they were kidnapped?\nFor some reason, Qiu Xingyuan even hoped to see Qiu Tong here. But he immediately chased that terrifying idea out of his mind!\n“Elder Brother, I am a little scared. Will Mommy come and save us?”\nQiu Xingyu tugged at his fingers as she looked at the sumptuous spread of fruits and delicacies on the table. She secretly hid a few of them, wanting to bring them back to Qiu Xingqiao and Qiu Tong.\nQiu Xingyuan shook his head and said firmly, “Don’t think about her anymore. We have to rely on ourselves!”\nChoosing the right moment, he sprayed his specially-concocted gas in the air, smashing things and causing a commotion.\nThe bodyguards outside the door heard the noise and ran in. They immediately inhaled the gas and fell to the ground weakly. They watched as the two children ran across their bodies while holding hands.\nPropped up by Qiu Xingyuan, Qiu Xingyu entered a few complicated codes into the touchscreen control panel at the door. She successfully hacked the surveillance system of the villa and paralyzed the entire building’s audio recording system.\n“Elder Brother, it’s done!”\n“Little Yu is awesome!”\nHolding Qiu Xingyu’s hand, Qiu Xingyuan slipped away from the corridor with her, avoiding the guards who had rushed over upon hearing the alarm.\nJust as they were catching their breath and thinking that they would be able to escape successfully, they bumped into a burly secret service agent. He looked down at the two children and blocked the stairway.\n“Where are you guys going?”\n“Elder Brother!”\nQiu Xingyu tugged at her brother’s sleeve in fear.\nQiu Xingyuan raised his arms to protect her, lifting his little chin stubbornly in an attempt to find a chance of survival in this desperate situation.\nHe secretly withdrew his fingers into his sleeve, wanting to take out a small amount of powder to create a smokescreen, so that Little Yu might be able to escape. However, he suddenly saw a black shadow appear in front of him!\nThe figure kicked the special agent’s abdomen and swiftly twisted his neck, making him go unconscious.\nQiu Xingyuan was stunned. Qiu Tong had really come!\n“Mommy!”\nQiu Xingyu cried out softly and threw herself into her arms. Her eyes were filled with tears. It was clear that she was extremely afraid.\nMeanwhile, Qiu Xingyuan’s thin lips were pursed tightly, but his tensed body had relaxed somewhat.\nQiu Tong put her index finger to her lips to indicate silence, but it was too late.. The noises emitted by the beaten secret service agent had already caught the attention of the lieutenant downstairs.",

      "content": "Chapter 42: Cover And Distraction\nCrap!\nWith Qiu Xingyu in one arm and holding Qiu Xingyuan’s hand in the other, Qiu Tong hid in the corner of the villa, hiding from the guards who were quietly searching.\nAfter observing the terrain, she realized that the only way to leave was through the living room where the lieutenant was!\nQiu Tong rolled to the other side, trying to investigate if there were any other routes, but unexpectedly met Jin Yang’s gaze.\nHe frowned slightly, his eyes flickering with surprise as if he was wondering why she was here.\n“Shh!”\nQiu Tong pressed her index finger against her lips and shook her head, indicating for him to keep quiet.\nThe lieutenant sensed his gaze and turned his body—\nQiu Tong quickly crouched down!\n“Your pets seem to be very restless. Why don’t we go take a look?”\nJin Yang only hesitated a moment before he spoke. Taking the lead, he strode up to the second floor, diverting the lieutenant’s attention.\nThe first lieutenant naturally didn’t dare to let him know that there were a couple of kidnapped children in the villa. He quickly followed him and said that he had a few bottles of fine red wine, inviting him to taste them.\nQiu Tong pushed the door open and pushed Qiu Xingyuan out of the door. She turned around to look at Jin Yang and gave him a grateful wink.\nIt seemed like she had wronged a good person!\nIf she were to meet him again, she would definitely think of a way to repay him for his help!\nJin Yang inadvertently turned around and was dazed by the sight.\nThe image of Qiu Tong’s eyes repeatedly replayed in his mind. That sense of familiarity assaulted him once more. He tried to recall where he had seen her before, but the sharp pain in his mind quickened his breathing and he winced.\nStartled, the lieutenant held him. “Are you all right, Sir?” he asked.\nJin Yang adjusted his breathing and shook off his arm. In a weak voice, he said, “I have something on today. I’ll try your red wine another day!”\nHis footsteps were hurried. He wanted to run out to find out if they had met before!\nBut where was she?\nThere were only a few patrolling guards, who seemed to be looking for something.\n“…Who is she?”\nJin Yang rubbed his temples. Every time he saw her, he seemed to be reminded of something, causing a headache!\nWhy?\nQiu Tong took advantage of the disruption to bring the two children to meet up with Qiu Xingqiao, who was hiding in the bushes. She hacked the door access system again and sneaked out through the opening.\nShe and the three children ran quickly without looking back.\nIt was not until they ran out of the villa’s vicinity that they dared to stop. They bent over and panted heavily.\nQiu Xingqiao furrowed his brows and said to Qiu Xingyuan, “Elder Brother, I’m sorry. Back then, I…”\nQiu Tong patted him on the head, forcing him to retract his apology. “It’s not your fault, why are you apologizing? Besides, you came out to pass the news to me, they won’t blame you, right?”\nQiu Xingyuan’s face was impassive. “You are just stating the obvious, aren’t you?”\nQiu Tong, “…”\nIn the villa, the first lieutenant received news from his subordinates that the two children had gone missing. He was so angry that he smacked the table and growled at them, saying that they were a bunch of useless good-for-nothings who couldn’t keep the two children locked up!\nThe secret service agent woke up from his unconscious state and ran to him to beg for forgiveness.\n“It was a woman who came to save them! I fought with her and her skills are pretty good!”\nAfter the secret service agent finished his report, the first lieutenant ordered all his guards to search the entire city for them. They must capture the children again!\nWhen they reached home, Qiu Tong locked the door firmly and put in place a few simple mechanisms that would alert them to intruders. She turned her head and saw Qiu Xingyu, whose eyes were filled with admiration, opening her arms to hug her.\n“Mommy, you’re amazing!”\nThis time, even Qiu Xingqiao nodded. “It looks… pretty awesome!”\nHowever, Qiu Xingyuan bit his lip and raised his head to stare at her with his stubborn little face. He deliberated over his words and asked, “Did you really not know that we were kidnapped? Did you betray us like last time?”\nQiu Tong was exasperated.\nAt this point, he was still worried that she would betray the children?\nShe really did not know if she should praise Qiu Xingyuan for his vigilance or feel ashamed that she had yet to gain his trust!\nHowever, what the former owner of her body did to them had created deep scars in their hearts, and that would require time to heal…\nQiu Tong could sense Qiu Xingyuan’s anxiety and stiffness. She smiled and said, “What are you talking about? I don’t lack money now. Besides, investing in you is much more worth it than selling you!”\n“I’m still waiting for you guys to study and become successful in future, so that you can take care of me in my old age! I’m so smart, I won’t invest in a lost-making venture!”\nAlthough her head was full of schemes, she had denied that she was in cahoots with the lieutenant in the villa. Qiu Xingyuan heaved a sigh of relief. His shoulders drooped as though he had just taken a pill to calm himself down. He tried to coax Qiu Xingyu to sleep.",

      "content": "Chapter 43: Mercenaries\nAt night, Qiu Tong turned and sat up. Qiu Xingyu was holding her and she gently pried open her arms, before moving away and walking to the living room.\nShe frowned when she thought of the official document with the red seal.\nThey mobilized a lieutenant from the military just to capture a few children?\nAll that had happened in the past few days had confirmed that there was a major power trying to snatch her children. Their motive was unknown!\nBut the children needed to study in kindergarten, and she couldn’t watch after them 24/7.\nDanger was inching closer like a grim reaper, forcing her to think of a way to get rid of the “flies” that surrounded them!\nQiu Tong turned on the computer and typed on the keyboard. She quickly entered a series of web addresses and entered the dark web anonymously.\n“Protecting children for one month. A team of three and above to rotate over a 24-hour shift. $500,000 upfront payment.”\nWhen this news was released, a group of mercenaries immediately accepted the contract and agreed to the specific details and location with her.\nQiu Tong looked back at the children who were sleeping soundly under the moonlight. She could sense their gradual transformations and her lips curled into a smile.\n…\nThe next day, five mercenaries with bearded faces and sharp eyes, as well as wearing camouflage uniforms with their muscular biceps exposed, came to the door.\nQiu Xingqiao saw them and instinctively raised his baseball bat to protect Little Yu.\n“Who are you?!”\nThe mercenaries looked at each other and glanced down at his smartwatch to check the address. “Is Qiu Tong your mother?”\nQiu Xingyuan stood up warily, frowning.\nQiu Xingyu nodded. “She’s our mommy! Why are you looking for her?”\n“Don’t reveal your identity! They might be bad people!”\nQiu Xingqiao was very street-smart, but Qiu Tong couldn’t help chuckling at his words. She wiped her wet hands on her apron and spoke up.\n“Come in. From today onwards, they are uncles who will protect you! Don’t be afraid!”\nProtect?\nQiu Xingyuan could see the disdain and contempt in the mercenaries’ eyes. He continued to shield Qiu Xingyu and maintained a distance from them.\nWasn’t this woman afraid that these men would have bad motives?\nSince when did she trust strangers so easily? Her personality had changed so much!\nMercenaries only respected strength and they would work for whoever paid them. Their attitude towards the children was perfunctory and although they would protect them, they did not respect them.\nSeeing that Qiu Xingyu wanted to go out and play, the mercenary leader Ke Le immediately reprimanded her.\n“Play?! Stay in the house and don’t go out! If you die, who will pay the rest of my fee?!”\nQiu Xingyu was so frightened that she shrank back. Her large eyes were filled with tears as she looked at Qiu Tong for help.\n“Mommy…”\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes, anger flashing across her eyes. “You guys are willing to work for money, but you don’t treat your employer very well!”\nThe leading mercenary was too lazy to even lift his eyes. “Cut the crap. If you guys weren’t as weak as trash, would you have spent money to hire us? In our world, whoever is strongest has the final say!”\n“Since you don’t have the capability, stop nagging. If you want to stay alive, listen to us…”\nBang!\nBefore he could finish speaking, Qiu Tong kicked in his direction!\nKe Le dodged nimbly and grabbed her ankle, wanting to throw her to the ground!\nQiu Tong swung twice through the air, hanging onto his throat, causing his body, which was twice her size, to fall to the ground. Ke Le’s face turned purple as he begged for mercy.\nA few mercenaries initially wanted to step forward to avenge him, but they were shocked by Qiu Tong’s well-trained actions and murderous intent.\nQiu Tong released Ke Le and dusted off her hands. She looked at him as he desperately gulped down fresh air while still sprawled on the ground.\n“Since whoever’s strongest has the final say, then do as I say and protect my children to the best of your abilities!”\n“But pay heed to your attitude!”\nThe mercenaries did not expect her to be so skilled and were impressed.\nKe Le no longer dared to casually sit on the chair. Instead, he leaned against the wall and nodded with a compliant attitude. “Yes, Boss.”\nThe other mercenaries also wiped away their shocked expressions and saluted Qiu Tong. They shouted in unison, “Yes, Boss!”\nQiu Xingyuan, “!!”\nQiu Xingyu exclaimed, “Wow! Mommy is so awesome! She’s like the violent hot chick in the movies!”\nWas that… a compliment?\nQiu Tong was dubious, but she accepted it. She sent the brats to kindergarten and headed to Mr. Cui’s villa.\nShe needed to settle some scores with him!\nThe villa’s security system was like useless decorations to Qiu Tong. She easily barged into the house and rummaged through Mr. Cui’s bedroom for the bank card she had gotten from selling her children.\nAfter that, she deliberately left behind Lin Shan’s hair tie and a few strands of her hair, placing them in a conspicuous place. She then transferred $150,000 from that card.\nQiu Tong then tossed aside the bank card in disdain, calculating how much money she could use to pay off the mercenaries.\nBefore she left, she smashed a few of Mr. Cui’s favorite antique collectibles.\nEven so, she believed she was going too easy on him!",

      "content": "Chapter 44: Teaching A Lesson\nMr. Cui came back and saw the broken pieces of antiques on the floor. His heart ached terribly. When he looked at his bank balance, he almost fainted.\nHe was so mad that he threw the hair tie at Lin Shan’s face. He pointed at her and cursed, “B*tch, how dare you steal from me!”\n“The evidence is right here! Spit out the money!”\nIn the past, she had been gentle and soft, but now, all her promises were like burst bubbles.\nLin Shan was shocked. She bit her lip and retorted, “It’s not me! How many women have you brought back? They are also suspects. Don’t blame me!”\n“You never intended to fulfill your promise to marry me! What do you take me for?”\nLin Shan was foolish enough to argue with him. Meanwhile, Mr. Cui only wanted to get the money back as soon as possible. He ignored her nonsense and pulled at her clothes, searching for the bank card in her pockets!\nAs the two of them argued, the door to the villa was suddenly kicked open.\nA few imposing men dressed in casual clothes, but who still held a military bearing, stepped through the door and stared at Mr. Cui.\n“The children are gone. Were there any other witnesses when you took the children away that day?”\n“Think carefully. Did anyone else know that they were at the villa?”\nMr. Cui stuttered in fear but shook his head profusely. He clasped his hands together nervously and respectfully, not daring to appear impertinent. “Sir, I was definitely not discovered!”\n“I always carry out my tasks discreetly! How could the children go missing?”\nThe man signaled to his subordinates, who immediately grabbed Mr. Cui by the collar and threw him out!\nMr. Cui’s spine hit the hard corner of a desk, and the pain of his broken bones made him wail. “Ah… let me go… I really didn’t…”\nHowever, the other party had no intention of stopping. He kicked Mr. Cui’s chest and saw a few drops of blood dribbled out from the corner of his mouth.\n“Stop!”\nAfter beating him up for a while, the man gave an order and his subordinates retreated two steps with their hands behind their backs, with Mr. Cui still trapped in the middle.\nThe leader squatted down, his eyes narrowed threateningly.\n“Do you remember now? Did anyone else see it?”\nLin Shan screamed in fright. Seeing that Mr. Cui was barely breathing, she rushed over to help him up. “Stop beating him, please stop it! I’ll tell you!”\n“It was Qiu Tong! When Qiu Tong came to find me, I told her…”\n“What? So it was you who betrayed me!”\nMr. Cui widened his eyes, clutching at his broken ribs. He ignored the pain and got up to give her a tight slap!\nSmack!\nA slap mark appeared on Lin Shan’s face but she didn’t dare to retort.\nMr. Cui turned around and smiled ingratiatingly. “Look, it’s all because of this b*tch. I really didn’t know, everyone…”\nThe man glanced at him contemptuously. After getting Qiu Tong’s address, he rushed straight to her residence without hesitation.\nHowever, as soon as they entered, they were met with five imposing mercenaries.\n“Damn it, there’s really someone who dares to snatch our wards from us!”\nKe Le took out a gun from his waist, and the muscles on his face tensed such that he looked extremely ferocious. “Brothers, show me how fearsome you can be! Go!”\nThese were professional mercenaries trained on the battlefield. Their murderous aura naturally surpassed that of others!\nThey did not care about their lives, but the other party could not afford to be careless. In just three to five minutes, the other party showed signs of fatigue and scattered.\nQiu Tong locked the three children in the room and came out to fight. She went straight for the leader and kicked him over with her leg. She grabbed his head and slammed it onto the ground.\nShe looked coldly at the blood dripping down the back of his head. She tugged at his hair and whispered into his ear.\n“Go back and tell your lieutenant not to come near my children again!”\n“If he dares to take my children, I will let him have a taste of his own medicine one day! Do not doubt my words!”\nQiu Tong’s tone was sinister, and the other party widened his eyes in shock.\nShe did not say anything else and directly instructed the mercenaries to throw those men out of the door before repairing and strengthening their intruder alert mechanisms.\nQiu Tong opened the door and saw that the three brats had their ears pressed against the door, eavesdropping on the battle outside. They seemed very nervous.\nShe smirked. “Looks like you’re worried about me?”\n“…”\nQiu Xingyuan turned his face away awkwardly. “Stop dreaming.”\nQiu Tong, “…”\nWas this really her biological son?\nQiu Xingyu asked, “Mommy won, right?”\nQiu Tong’s heart softened when she saw Qiu Xingyu’s sparkling eyes. She hugged her and gave her a peck on the cheek. She raised her eyebrows smugly. “Of course!”\nQiu Xingqiao stared at her with a burning gaze. He was obviously envious of her powerful abilities but was too embarrassed to speak because he had failed to take their earlier training seriously.\nQiu Tong understood and pointed to a few sandbags in the corner.\n“Carry a heavy load and squat 300 times a day. After seven days, I’ll teach you a few moves.”\n“Will do!”\nThe children were elated and nodded in unison!",

      "content": "Chapter 45: Looking for Trouble\nOutside, the soldiers helped their injured leader to a safe spot before calling Lieutenant Xiao Zhen, who was waiting in the villa.\n“Reporting, Sir. The children are protected by a group of powerful mercenaries. We can’t get close.”\n“Trash! A bunch of good-for-nothings!”\nXiao Zhen reprimanded them before hanging up the phone in a huff.\nHe did not expect that this stupid woman, who was rumored to only care about money, had become so smart and powerful that she could actually finish off the people he sent.\nCould the rumors have been wrong?\nIt looked like they had to rely on their wits now, and not just clash head-on with Qiu Tong!\n…\nIn the kindergarten, the children trailed after Qiu Xingyu and the other two like a pack of dogs, stealing glances at Ke Le…\nThe mercenaries kept a straight face as they watched the naughty brats prod them with their fingers. The kids were so envious that they started salivating. They shouted, “Wow! They’re mercenaries! So powerful!”\nQiu Xingqiao lifted his small face proudly, his eyes full of pride.\nLittle Yu stood on her tiptoes and called out to Qiu Tong, “Goodbye, Mommy!”\nQiu Tong waved and sighed. She touched her empty wallet and turned to go and make money to support her family.\nOutside the clinic, the boss squatted under the sign with his head in his hands. When he sensed that someone was there, he said without looking up.\n“Leave. The miracle doctor isn’t here!”\n“I’m here.”\nQiu Tong suppressed her laughter and pushed open the door. She saw two pots of green plants in front of the curtain separating the office area, as if waiting for her to return…\n“Aiyo! You’re finally here! I thought you weren’t coming anymore!”\nWhen the boss saw that it was her, his attitude instantly improved. He moved the ladder over and hung the banner that said “Miracle Doctor, Treats All Illnesses”!\nQiu Tong stood by the side of the road and saw an anxious young man carrying an elderly man on his back. They were hurrying toward another clinic at the end of the street.\nThe old man’s face was pale, and he seemed to be in dire straits. He could not afford to waste another minute.\nShe frowned and stopped him. “The patient’s condition is not good. Don’t move him about too much. Stop carrying him around.”\nThe young man was a little flustered. “Then what should we do? I have to bring Grandfather for treatment!”\nQiu Tong moved and revealed the clinic’s sign behind her. “This is a clinic. Bring your grandfather in. I can see him.”\n“…Alright!”\nThe young man looked hesitantly at the end of the street. Gritting his teeth, he carried his grandfather into the clinic.\nA gangster standing on the street with a toothpick in his mouth saw this and spat.\n“Damn it, this clinic again! They’re stealing my sister’s business! Let’s go, we’ll teach them a lesson later!”\nInside the clinic, the young man clenched his fists nervously. He took out all the money from his pockets and spoke with a trembling voice.\n“Please save my grandfather!”\nQiu Tong lifted the old man’s clothes and discovered that there was a wound on his abdomen. The wound had not been properly treated and was infected with pus which resulted in his current critical condition…\nUsing her silver needles as a conductor, she used her supernatural power to slowly scrape away the festering flesh. She made the wound stop bleeding and then bandaged it.\nQiu Tong watched as the old man’s breathing gradually stabilized and said, “It’s done.”\nThe young man widened his eyes. “You’re really a miracle doctor! I spent thousands of dollars in the other clinic, but Grandpa’s condition just kept getting worse.”\nIt turned out that they had ended up delaying proper treatment because of those quack doctors.\nThe young man thanked her repeatedly. She wiped the silver needles with a cotton cloth and waited for the next patient. However, she heard a commotion at the door…\nA few tough-looking men carried in a stretcher with a man screaming in pain. They set him on the ground.\n“Miracle doctor? Hurry up and take a look at my brother. If he can’t be cured, I’ll destroy your shop! What kind of bullshit signboard is that? It’s all a lie!”\nHis loud voice attracted a lot of onlookers.\nQiu Tong frowned, sensing his hostility. She examined the sick man’s body. His face was ruddy, and there was nothing wrong with his muscles or bones. What was wrong with him?\nThey were obviously here to cause trouble and were just using him as an excuse!\nShe smirked and said, “He’s not sick. Leave now. Don’t obstruct my consultations.”\nOne of the boorish men rolled up his sleeves. “Bah! A quack! My brother is already in so much pain! How can he not be sick? Don’t tell me he’s just pretending?”\nQiu Tong saw that they were unwilling to give up. She placed her fingers on the “patient’s” ankle and twisted it forcefully…\n“Ah!”\nHis fake wailing was instantly raised by an entire octave. He was in so much pain that his entire body was twitching and he was sweating profusely.\nThe boorish man looked a little anxious. “What are you doing!”\nQiu Tong looked up, exuding an oppressive and cold aura. “Since you want to create trouble, you should put on a better act. Don’t expose any flaws. Carry him away. It’s just a dislocation, it can still be fixed…”\nThe boorish man pointed at Qiu Tong and the boss and hollered. “Do you know who you’ve offended?”\n“My sister is Mayor Shen’s relative! This isn’t over! Just you wait, don’t try to run away. I’ll make you suffer!”",

      "content": "Chapter 46: Unemployed\nQiu Tong rubbed her wrists indifferently, not taking them seriously.\nThe boorish man carried his injured friend back to the clinic at the end of the street. He shouted angrily. “Sister! That clinic doesn’t know its place! Tell Mayor Shen to destroy them! I don’t know where this bullshit miracle doctor came from and how much business she has already stolen from us!”\n“They are showing you utter disrespect!”\nHearing this, a woman in a white coat swept a bunch of medicine all over the floor. “It’s that b*tch again! I’m going to get her kicked out of the clinic!”\nAt night, in a room on a round bed in the hotel, the air was filled with the scent of love.\nMayor Shen was so tired that he collapsed on the bed. He hugged his lover and patted her butt.\nThe woman snuggled in his arms and said, “My dear, someone is bullying me! Are you going to do something about it? I don’t know where this swindling woman came from. She stole my business and even hit my people!”\n“She obviously doesn’t respect you! She clearly knows that I’m yours…”\nShe deliberately provoked as her hands continued teasing him.\nMayor Shen’s eyes were bloodshot. He flipped over and pinned the woman down while panting heavily. He promised. “Serve me well tonight. Tomorrow, I’ll send some people over to settle them!”\nThe next day, when Qiu Tong arrived at the clinic from the kindergarten, she saw a few police officers putting a seal on the door…\nWhen the boss saw her, he quickly ran over quietly and said bitterly, “The clinic is closed for business.”\n“They claim that the environment does not meet hygiene standards. I tried a bit of bribery and heard that… it was because I hired a non-licensed staff.”\nHe stole a glance at Qiu Tong’s face and said frankly, “I’m guessing you offended some higher-ups yesterday. You definitely can’t continue practicing medicine.”\nAlthough the boss hoped that he could keep this miracle doctor, he had no choice but to let her go if he wished to continue his business!\nAfter pondering for a long time, he was finally forced to tell Qiu Tong that she need not come to the clinic in the future…\nHaving lost her job, Qiu Tong frowned worriedly. Thinking of the three little kids at home and the five greedy mercenaries, she felt a headache coming on.\nAt noon, the whole family sat at the dining table. The table was filled with vegetables.\nQiu Tong ate the stir-fried vegetables without any restraint, not forgetting to select a few nutritious leafy vegetables and placing them in the children’s bowls. Ke Le was stunned by the sight of Qiu Tong and the three children digging into their food.\nThere were two rice grains at the corner of Little Yu’s mouth. She looked up at him and asked in a childish voice, “Uncle, why aren’t you eating?”\n“If you don’t eat now, you’ll go hungry!”\nKe Le and his men looked at each other. Not wanting to disappoint the little angels, they could only take up their chopsticks and dig into their food…\nQiu Xingyuan and the other two had a hard life before. To be able to fill their stomachs with white rice alone would have been good enough for them.\nBut Ke Le was a carnivorous mercenary. If he couldn’t eat meat, how would he have the strength?\nHe picked up two vegetable leaves, chewing and swallowing with difficulty. His face was pale.\n“Boss, can our food… be slightly better?”\nKe Le went into the kitchen and took the initiative to wash the bowls for Qiu Tong. His thick arms holding onto the small porcelain bowls looked rather comical.\nThe baskets on the floor were filled with the cheapest vegetables. Ke Le felt dizzy just looking at them…\nQiu Tong was also helpless. Seeing that Qiu Xingqiao had led Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingyu Bao to exercise their bodies, she said, “I have spent all my money to hire you. Where would I get the spare cash to buy meat? I just lost my job today too. Life is tough!”\nEspecially now that the children’s bodies were still growing, they couldn’t go back to catching mice and birds to eat!\nQiu Tong was fretting as she plucked at the vegetables to vent her frustration. Where could she find a job to earn money?\nWhy not try the boxing ring again?\nKe Le was taken aback by her words. He had been impressed by Qiu Tong’s skills and had never expected her to lack money!\nHe suggested to Qiu Tong, “With your ability, you can try accepting missions from the Dark Web! The rewards are very high!”\n“We saw recently that there is a high-paying local contract to protect important persons and eliminate terrorists…”\n“But to be honest, that mission is definitely dangerous and not as easy as protecting some children! That’s why we didn’t take it on!”\nKe Le scratched his head foolishly. Qiu Tong’s eyes lit up as if she could see a large wad of cash waving at her.\nWith great interest, she peppered Ke Le with questions about the process of accepting missions from the Dark Web before running back to her room. She entered the Dark Web and went straight to the special mission!\nAccording to the communication method provided by the Dark Web, Qiu Ying dialed the other party’s number. After a few seconds of the dialing tone, she tapped the screen lightly with her fingers and narrowed her eyes.\n“Hello?”\nThe voice on the other end sounded extremely metallic, but Qiu Tong found it rather familiar. She stared at the Dark Web mission. “I’m here to apply to be a personal bodyguard…”",

      "content": "Chapter 47: Personal Bodyguard\n“Personal bodyguard? Sorry, we don’t want women.”\nThe other party was about to hang up, but Qiu Tong suddenly said, “The Dark Web rules state that only those who fail the test can be disqualified. You want to dismiss me with just a few words? I’m going to report you! You won’t be able to issue missions on the Dark Web anymore!”\n“Your stubborn mindset needs to be changed. Why do you think women are inferior to men?”\nQiu Tong lowered her voice and said bluntly, “Give me a chance to prove my strength. If I don’t meet your standards… you can do whatever you want with me then!”\nThe other party remained silent for a long time before agreeing to meet her.\nQiu Tong followed the address she received and rushed to the villa hidden in the forest. The bodyguards covered her eyes with a black cloth and brought her through layers of guards and searches, before finally arriving at the guest room.\nQiu Tong removed the black cloth and was secretly amazed. It seemed like he was really a big shot!\nClick!\nThe door was open from the outside, and a long shadow stepped in. When their eyes met, both parties were so shocked that their mouths gaped.\n“It’s you?”\n“Why is it you!”\nQiu Tong did not expect the interviewee to be Shao An!\nShe recalled that “Song Yan” had helped her at the lieutenant’s villa. She had to repay this favor!\nQiu Tong waved her hand and suggested, “We’re all friends, so we can discuss a 10% discount on the fee! That’s nice enough of me, right?”\n“It can’t be any cheaper! I have three children to raise, and life is tough!”\nQiu Tong saw that Shao An was about to say something but stopped himself. She quickly started stretching and asked, “Do you want to spar with me to test me?”\nShao An had a strange expression as he shook his head and said, “No need. Come with me.”\nQiu Tong was indeed skilled, but her status…\nShao An knocked lightly on the door. Jin Yang stood in front of the French windows, his black shirt unbuttoned. He turned around and met Qiu Tong’s almond-shaped eyes. He was extremely surprised.\n“She’s the one who accepted the Dark Web mission.”\nShao An explained. Jin Yang’s pupils constricted. He pressed his thumb lightly on his palm and frowned.\nThe terrorists had attacked him ruthlessly several times in the past. They hid in the dark like ghosts, and as his personal bodyguard, she had to protect him with her life when necessary…\nHe didn’t want anything to happen to Qiu Tong.\nA strong desire to protect surged in Jin Yang’s heart, and he rejected her bluntly, “You won’t do.”\n“Why?”\nQiu Tong was dissatisfied. She threw her coat to the ground and said with a determined look, “Why don’t we spar?”\n“Standard rules. If I lose, I’ll scram.”\n“If I win, the bodyguard position is mine!”\nA strange emotion flashed across Jin Yang’s eyes. He twisted an antique porcelain bottle and a wall slowly rose, revealing the boxing ring hidden inside.\nQiu Tong leaped onto the stage. She used her teeth to fasten her boxing gloves. She tilted her head at Jin Yang, before crouching back like a cheetah and attacking his abdomen!\nJin Yang shifted his feet and successfully dodged two seconds before she made contact.\n“Stop insisting! This job is not suitable for you.”\n“If you need money, I can…”\nQiu Tong’s eyes glimmered. Taking advantage of the moment when Jin Yang let down his guard, she bent her elbow and used a feint to deceive him into counterattacking.\nIn the next second, she pressed Jin Yang down with all her weight and pinned him to the ground. She straddled his waist and forced him into immobility.\nShao An was below the stage. When he saw the two people entangled together, he quietly looked away.\nDid… did Jin Yang deliberately give in to her?\n“Have we… met before?”\nAgainst the light, Jin Yang looked at her blurry silhouette and found it extremely familiar. The fragrance that drifted over seemed to engulf his sealed memories.\nHe tried his best to think about it. Intense pain filled his entire body in an instant, causing him to shut his eyes tightly and breathe heavily.\nQiu Tong felt his pain and relaxed her hold slightly. However, she did not expect Jin Yang to take the opportunity to gain the upper hand and pin her down.\nJin Yang held her hands above her head, a smile on his lips.\nQiu Tong struggled and cursed, “You cheated!”\nJin Yang smiled and said softly, “You’ve lost!”\nQiu Tong lowered her eyes and bit her red lips as if she had been wronged. Her proud chest heaved up and down as she breathed heavily, causing Jin Yang’s throat to tighten and his blood to gather below the waist. He was afraid of hurting her, so he loosened his grip…\nNow!\nA crafty look flashed across Qiu Tong’s eyes as she suddenly bent her knee and struck his vital point.\nJin Yang dodged to the side, wanting to control Qiu Tong again. He looked up and saw the sharp hair clip she was holding at his neck…\nQiu Tong crouched down in front of him. She heard Shao An running up the stage in a panic. Her red lips moved to his ear as she spoke softly.\n“I won!”",

      "content": "Chapter 48: Money\nDisregarding the outcome, Jin Yang’s thoughts were in a mess.\nQiu Tong leaned against the ropes of the ring, proudly curling the ends of her hair around her fingertips. She lifted her head proudly and heroically, the familiar expression causing Jin Yang so much pain that he couldn’t breathe.\nHe placed a hand over his heart and knelt on one knee. But he then suddenly grabbed Qiu Ying’s wrist!\n“What’s the matter?”\nQiu Tong lowered her eyes in bewilderment. When she met his blank and helpless gaze, her heart trembled.\nJin Yang panted heavily and asked, “Have we… really never met before?”\nIt seemed that he would ask the same question every time they met.\nQiu Tong simply thought that he looked like the children, but he did not exist in her memory at all. She shook her head firmly. “No.”\nJin Yang lowered his eyes and looked away. He propped himself up on the ground, his expression gradually returning to its usual coldness.\nHe used a silk handkerchief to wipe the dust on his fingertips. He looked up and said in the tone of an employer, “We want to eliminate terrorists, who use cruel methods and have unpredictable whereabouts. Their numbers are unknown, but the operation is extremely dangerous.”\nQiu Tong’s reply was extremely serious. “I know, the Dark Web has the mission information.”\nJin Yang cleared his throat at her unexpected frankness. With a conflicted expression, he reminded her, “Are you not afraid of death?”\nQiu Tong suddenly realized what he was thinking and smiled faintly. “They can’t hurt me.”\nWhat kind of confidence was this! What arrogance!\nJin Yang thought of all the strange things about her and asked, “Do you know a lot about terrorists? Perhaps, you’ve been to places like research labs?”\nQiu Tong shook her head. She had never come into contact with terrorists before, but post-apocalyptic zombies were much harder to deal with than terrorists!\nHer eyes were clear as she asked, “Aren’t they just ordinary people with two hands and two legs?”\n“Don’t tell me their stamina is a hundred times stronger than an ordinary person?”\n“…”\nShao An listened to her nonsense in shock and stared at Jin Yang with an unfathomable expression…\nJin Yang was amused by her frank yet ignorant attitude. He walked over to the desk with deliberation, opened the drawer and took out a checkbook. He scribbled down a string of numbers and handed it to Qiu Tong.\n“I admit that you have super strong combat abilities, but you know nothing about our operation against the enemy. As such, you have no chance of winning!”\n“I’ll give you $300,000. Take it and do what you want with it.”\nQiu Tong kept the check without hesitation and patted his shoulder. “Of course I have to do something after receiving the money. Don’t worry, I won’t be a burden!”\n“One more person means one more helping hand!”\nJin Yang couldn’t help but laugh at her words. He shook his head and wanted to persuade her to give up, but Qiu Tong insisted that she couldn’t accept money for nothing.\n“If you refuse, I will just hide outside the villa and follow you to destroy the terrorist organization!”\n“Since I am already involved now, why don’t we go through the battle tactics for the operation together?”\nQiu Tong’s stubborn attitude made Jin Yang frown. In the end, he reluctantly agreed to let her stay and join the operation.\nBut Jin Yang reminded her, “Safety above all. Don’t just charge forward…”\nQiu Tong agreed perfunctorily, but in her heart, she was planning to kill a few more terrorists. After the matter was settled, she would ask Jin Yang for more money!\nHer eyes darted around and a wicked smile appeared on her lips. She had accurately hit Jin Yang’s weak spot, causing him to lose focus.\nQiu Tong returned home and packed her things, preparing to move to Jin Yang’s villa for a week.\nShe called the children over and rubbed their heads. She said, “Mommy has some things to do and needs to leave for a few days. You guys stay at home obediently. You’re not allowed to quarrel with your kindergarten friends. You’re not allowed to run away!”\nShe turned to look at Ke Le and said calmly, “Take good care of them!”\nKe Le slapped his hand to his chest to reassure her.\nLittle Yu raised her head and hugged Qiu Tong’s waist, asking her with a clingy voice, “Mommy, where are you going? Can you bring us along?”\nThe mission was dangerous. Qiu Tong didn’t want the children to worry about her. With Qiu Xingqiao’s personality, he might follow her secretly.\nAs she thought about it, she casually fabricated a lie and coaxed, “Mommy is going to borrow some money from a relative. When I return, I will buy a doll for Little Yu and lots of meat for you guys to eat!”\nQiu Xingyuan stood in a corner and looked at her with a dark expression. He bit his lips and said with difficulty, “Can you… not leave?”\n“A while ago, you asked me to study the locust pesticide. There’s already some progress.”\n“If there really is a locust plague, we can earn a lot of money…”\nQiu Xingyuan clenched his fists and lowered his head, so that no one could see the emotions in his eyes.\nSensing his reluctance, Qiu Xingqiao looked at his elder brother and said crisply, “Mommy will be back soon!”",

      "content": "Chapter 49: Leaving Home\n“Be good! The more money we have, the better things will be. Mommy has already agreed to help…”\nQiu Tong nearly blurted out the truth. But disappointment flashed across Qiu Xingyuan’s eyes as he looked at her. He stubbornly pursed his lips and turned away, not saying anything else.\nHolding Little Yu’s hand, Qiu Xingqiao saw Qiu Tong to the door. His eyes were filled with reluctance.\nQiu Tong’s eyes were gentle as she hugged the two kids and kissed their cheeks with a smile.\nShe looked up and saw Qiu Xingyuan standing at the door with a cold expression, as if he did not want to talk to her at all. She guessed that he might be angry, but she could not figure out what was going on in his little head.\nQiu Tong sighed helplessly and said, “Take care of your brother and sister for Mommy.”\nQiu Xingyuan’s little face was all scrunched up, and his shoulders were stiff as he spat out a few words, “Do I still need you to tell me that?”\nQiu Tong stood up. Carrying a backpack full of clothes, she hurried towards the main entrance.\n“Goodbye, Mommy! Come back soon!”\nA luxury car was parked at the entrance of the courtyard. Qiu Tong entered and Little Yu ran down the steps with tears in her eyes. She chased after the car and shouted twice.\n“Mommy… Mommy!”\nWhen Jin Yang heard the voice, he turned his head with a strange expression. He seemed to be scanning the area with his mind, but all he saw was an empty district.\nHe looked away and fixed his gaze on Qiu Tong fiddling with a few peculiar-looking wrist guards, knee guards, and self-made weapons. “You have very few things…”\nIn his impression, women always carried countless luggage when they traveled.\nQiu Tong misunderstood his question. She pressed down on the mechanism on her wrist guard, revealing a few sharp barbs. She raised her hand and said softly, “Weapons need to be simple but refined. The important thing is that it can save your life. Do you guys like to carry weights when carrying out missions?”\nJin Yang rubbed his temples and simply shook his head in silence.\nQiu Tong shrugged. After just half an hour, she started to miss the three children at home…\nAt home, the children hung their heads.\nHolding a milk bottle, Qiu Xingyu ran to Qiu Xingyuan’s side. She tugged at the corner of his clothes. “Elder Brother, why are you unhappy? Do you miss Mommy?”\n“Little Yu misses Mommy too. When will she be back?”\nShe was not coming back!\nQiu Xingyuan thought silently in his heart, but he could not bear to tell Qiu Xingyu that their mother had abandoned them again.\nEver since the fall of the Qiu family, their relatives had cut off all contact with them and were too lazy to bother with them. They would avoid them even if they met them on the streets.\nBut Qiu Tong said she was going to borrow money from them?\nShe must have been lying!\nPerhaps Qiu Tong had found a new boyfriend and the other party was unwilling to accept her children, so she chose to abandon them!\nQiu Xingyuan secretly clenched his fists and swore that he would take good care of his younger siblings!\n…\nIn the villa, Jin Yang accompanied Qiu Tong to walk around and familiarize herself with the environment.\nButler Gao De rushed over and dragged Shao An into a storage room. Seeing that no one was following them, he asked in a low voice.\n“Sir actually brought a woman back?”\nShao An nodded.\nGao De muttered in disbelief, “Impossible!”\nShao An pursed his lips and reminded him, “I’m also very surprised, but tell all the servants in the villa that she is his personal bodyguard. Don’t go around spreading gossip!”\nGao De responded perfunctorily, his thoughts involuntarily drifting back to some years ago. He furrowed his brow.\nJin Yang once had a lover whom he loved deeply. It had been an extremely secretive matter, so secretive that only he knew about it…\nBut seven years ago, on a stormy night, Jin Yang dragged his heavily injured body back to the villa. He had a high fever and was unconscious for a few days. When he finally woke up, he never mentioned her again.\nGao De had tried several times to probe, but Jin Yang’s reaction was as if he had completely forgotten that there was a lover in his life. He was now only obsessed with government affairs…\nAll these years, there had been countless women who had tried to climb into Jin Yang’s bed, but he had never gotten close to any of them.\nGao De even suspected that he had a psychological problem, but now… he actually brought a woman back?\nWould she be an exception?\nGao De was immersed in his memories when he was awakened by a deep voice…\n“Butler Gao.”\n“This is Qiu Tong.”\nJin Yang and Qiu Tong had returned and he offered a simple introduction.\nQiu Tong nodded as she surveyed the luxurious interior of the villa. She clicked her tongue in admiration. He was indeed rich!\nGao De sized up Qiu Tong and unexpectedly discovered that she was allowed to stand within Jin Yang’s personal space!\nGao De met Qiu Tong’s probing gaze and smiled apologetically. He put away his doubts and looked at Jin Yang, asking respectfully, “Sir, I’ll arrange for someone to tidy up the guest room and temporarily arrange for Miss Qiu to stay there. What do you think?”",

      "content": "Chapter 50: In The Same Room\n“No, I want to stay with him.”\nQiu Tong pointed at Jin Yang, not the least bit shy or bashful.\nHer experience in the post-apocalyptic era told her that as a personal bodyguard, she should be with her employer at all times. Otherwise, if zombies attacked at night, they would break into the bedroom through the window, and she would not be able to protect her employer!\nContrary to her calm attitude, countless thoughts flashed through Shao An’s mind as he looked at Qiu Tong with a complicated expression.\nGao De quietly sized up Jin Yang. Surprisingly, he did not reject Qiu Tong’s request. Instead, his thin lips curled into a smile.\nShao An narrowed his eyes and sized up Qiu Tong’s appearance and figure. The more he thought about it, the more he felt that something was amiss. He suspected that she had some ulterior motive and was deliberately trying to get close to Jin Yang!\nQiu Tong understood what Shao An and Gao De were worried about. She walked upstairs with her backpack, calling out in a mocking tone.\n“I have no intention of finding a stepfather for my children for the time being… Hey, which room do you live in?”\nGao De, “!!!”\nShao An, “…”\nGao De could not hide his shock and secretly quietly calmed his anxious heart when he heard that Qiu Tong had children.\nJin Yang took out two bottles of fine red wine from the wine cellar and poured them into the decanter, gently swirling it as he admired the dense bubbles…\nGao De understood his tacit approval and took the initiative to lead Qiu Tong to Jin Yang’s spacious suite-style room.\nShao An looked at Qiu Tong’s increasingly outrageous behavior and wanted to stop her. “Sir, her identity is suspicious. You can’t let her behave so wantonly…”\nJin Yang’s voice was cold and carried a commanding tone that could not be refuted. “Just do your own part well.”\n“You have no right to interfere with my decision!”\nShao An stood rooted to the ground. His expression changed slightly before he lowered his head and replied, “Yes, I understand.”\nAt night, Jin Yang had already fallen asleep. Qiu Tong changed into a set of casual sportswear and sat cross-legged on the sofa outside, flipping through the small sketchbook she carried with her.\nThis contained the drawings which Qiu Xingyu had done in the kindergarten’s drawing class. The lines were crooked and the colors were mixed haphazardly, such that it was impossible to tell what she was drawing. Nevertheless, Qiu Tong still admired it endlessly, as if she was holding Picasso’s own sketches…\nThe clock on the clock pointed to one in the morning. Muted knocking noises could be heard inside Jin Yang’s house.\nQiu Tong picked up a baseball bat and quietly pushed the door open. She checked that the doors and windows were all tightly shut and no strangers had sneaked in.\nOn his Morandi-colored bed, Jin Yang was frowning as if he was deep in the throes of a nightmare. There seemed to be an intense chase in his dream. He kept waving his hands, which knocked against the bedside table several times, creating the noise which Qiu Tong heard.\nQiu Tong watched him from the end of the bed. She had found the source of the sounds.\nShe was a little conflicted. Protecting her employer shouldn’t include helping him chase away nightmares, right?\n“…Don’t go!”\nJin Yang muttered, his cold and handsome face revealing a hint of helplessness. From time to time, he would raise his hand, as if wanting to grab something.\nQiu Tong’s heart softened. She walked to the bed and used her fingertips to gently smooth his furrowed brows.\n“He looks strong and stubborn. I didn’t expect him to be so fragile in his dreams… what is he dreaming about? Zombies?”\nShe mumbled to herself as she patted Jin Yang’s shoulder half-heartedly.\nIn the next second, Jin Yang seemed to have sensed something. He grabbed her wrist and pulled her onto the bed. He leaned over and wrapped his arms and legs around her in an embrace, before burying his head in her neck as if seeking warmth and comfort.\nQiu Tong’s body stiffened. She wanted to push him away, but realized that Jin Yang’s strength in this dream-like state was astonishing!\nJin Yang murmured in a daze, craving the warmth of her body. He kept asking, “Where did you go? Why… did you leave me behind!”\nQiu Tong couldn’t understand him. She frowned and waved her hand in front of his eyes, confirming that he was still asleep.\n“Let go of me!”\nQiu Tong wanted to break free from his restraint, but every time she tried to pry his fingers away, Jin Yang would hug her even more tightly…\nQiu Tong had to face up to reality and resign herself to fate. She lightly patted Jin Yang back and hummed a lullaby which she used to coax Little Yu to sleep…\n“I won’t leave you behind, I promise.”\nGradually, she could not keep her eyes open any longer and also fell into a deep sleep.\nThe next morning, Qiu Tong and Jin Yang woke up at the same time. They looked at each other in their embrace, before jumping apart as if they had been electrocuted!\nQiu Tong explained, “You were the one who held onto me last night and forbade me from leaving.”\nJin Yang couldn’t remember anything at all. Every once in a while, he would have the same nightmare, chasing after the back of a woman he would never be able to touch. He rubbed his aching temples and was about to say something when the door was pushed open…\nShao An held some documents in his hand and wanted to report to Jin Yang about important matters, but he saw them sitting on the bed together!\n“Sir?!”",

      "content": "Chapter 51: Action\nJin Yang was stunned for a moment before he pulled the bedsheet to cover up Qiu Tong.\nQiu Tong fiddled with her messy hair. From the corner of her eye, she saw Jin Yang buttoning up the top few buttons of his shirt. His actions were suave and charming.\nShao An sized them up with a complicated gaze. He was clearly conjuring up some intense and amorous images.\nQiu Tong coughed lightly and tried to explain, but was interrupted by the person beside her…\nJin Yang coldly glanced at Shao An. “Speak.”\nShao An was stunned. He looked away and respectfully lowered his eyes. He held the document with both hands. “All the military forces that can be deployed around the residential building and the two sides of the street are already stationed there. They can attack terrorists at any time…”\n“As for the underground boxing arena, it’s been taken care of on the grounds that it has already been closed down. There’s no controversy or suspicion at the moment.”\nJin Yang nodded, flipping through the documents with his slender fingers.\nQiu Tong leaned over curiously and pressed her body against his arm.\nA milky fragrance wafted into Jin Yang’s nose, causing his breathing to halt for a moment. He subconsciously pushed the map in front of her so that she could look at it.\nQiu Tong quickly memorized the information and connected the clues together. She finally understood why he had gone to the underground boxing arena to watch the matches that day.\nBelow the boxing arena was a human trafficking den, which was closely linked to terrorists!\nJin Yang’s throat tightened and he said in a hoarse voice, “Gather all the elite soldiers at the exit. We will take action at the predetermined time tonight…”\nAfter he said that, he looked at Shao An who was still standing at the door and narrowed his eyes impatiently. “Is there anything else?”\nShao An hurriedly shook his head and turned around, before walking off with stiff steps, closing the bedroom door.\nIn the confined space, both of them felt somewhat awkward.\nQiu Tong picked up the pillow that had been thrown onto the floor and looked at his furrowed brows. The side profile of his thin lips looked somewhat bewildered and adorable. She asked curiously, “You had a nightmare last night, remember? I think you were looking for someone.”\nJin Yang’s profound eyes were slightly closed and his mind was blank. “I don’t remember.”\nQiu Tong shrugged and stopped asking.\n…\nLate at night, Jin Yang sat in a heavily armored SUV and parked in an alley two streets away from the underground boxing arena.\nQiu Tong examined the weapons and equipment. She deftly wrapped her hands with hand wraps.\nJin Yang passed a bulletproof vest to her and said with an unfathomable expression, “These terrorists are very vicious. If you encounter danger, hide at the back. Remember, safety first.”\nQiu Tong placed the bulletproof vest over his body and chuckled valiantly. “My mission is to protect you. Don’t worry! I am lucky and won’t die!”\nShe seemed to have an innate self-confidence that was dazzling and captivating.\nJin Yang recalled the vague female voice he heard when he was shot. He held her wrist and asked, “You…”\nWas she a successful product of the human modification plan?\nHe did not say this out loud. Shao An stood in front of the vehicle and knocked lightly on the glass window. He informed Jin Yang via the communication system.\n“It’s time, Chief.”\nJin Yang retracted his gaze and took a deep breath before pushing the car door open. “Move out.”\nHe issued an order and all the armed soldiers rushed into the first level of the basement in the corner of the street. Apart from some broken tables and chairs, there were only a few human traffickers who tried to resist. The soldiers easily surrounded and controlled them, before making their way into the floor below.\nThe few electric lights in the stairwell flickered. An old fan creaked.\nQiu Tong followed Jin Yang closely, protecting him.\nShao An held his gun and pushed open the door with his left hand. Instantly, countless people rushed out from inside…\nThey used their bodies as shields, both young and old. Their eyes were empty but filled with fear as they advanced. The soldiers were stunned for a moment. They took out their guns and prepared to fire indiscriminately.\nJin Yang’s eyes were locked on them. He could sense that this group of commoners were not equipped with weapons and were being used by others!\nHe immediately shouted, “Halt all fire! Protect the civilians!”\nIn the next second, an old man with tattered clothes and white hair staggered forward at Jin Yang.\nHe opened his hands and was about to touch the corner of Jin Yang’s clothes. He muttered in terror, “Save me! Sir, save me…”\nDid he know Jin Yang?\nQiu Tong heard a strange beeping sound from the old man!\nSomething was amiss!\nShe lowered her eyes and saw the red numbers and wires on his waist. She quickly pushed the old man away and shouted, “Be careful! There’s a bomb! Stay away from them!”\nThanks to her warning, all the soldiers became vigilant and restrained the wandering civilians.\nQiu Tong immediately pounced towards Jin Yang, protecting him with her body and using her arms to shield his head…",

      "content": "Chapter 52: Decryption\nBang!\nThe bomb was detonated and the heatwave from the explosion pushed Jin Yang and Qiu Tong to a corner.\nJin Yang’s pupils constricted. Qiu Tong was in his arms and their lips were pressed against each other through their masks.\nMultiple explosions rang out one after another in the second level basement. With this method, the lives of countless civilians were used to attack the soldiers. The military unit suffered heavy losses.\nThere was a burnt smell in the air and tattered clothes were scattered on the ground.\nThe remaining soldiers bypassed the iron gate and barged in. Where were the terrorists?\nThere were only a few iron cages left behind, that reeked of blood, as well as some abandoned firearms.\nThey gritted their teeth in frustration. The ambush plan that they had planned for days had failed.\nQiu Tong stood up awkwardly and helped Jinyang up. She followed Shao An to check the scene.\nThe old man who had attacked Jin Yang had his limbs torn apart due to the explosion of the bomb. The scene was tragic. Qiu Tong used her leg to kick the corpse on the ground and discovered that a woman in the corner was still breathing weakly…\nQiu Tong covered her most critical wound with her hand and used her special ability to heal her, so that her life would be out of danger for the time being.\nShe restrained the person and asked, “Who kidnapped you all? Why did you agree to become a human bomb? Cooperate with us and I will ensure that you can leave safely. You can change your name and welcome a new life.”\n“They are terrorists! The organization is huge, the division of labor is clear, there are also the lookouts…”\n“There are many secret exits in this building. If there is any disturbance, they can quickly retreat and escape.”\n“They carry out a lot of human trafficking. They kidnap us to sell and keep us in cages. If there’s an emergency, they’ll kick us out and send us to our deaths. They are just betting on the fact that you won’t shoot…”\nQiu Tong frowned as Jin Yang listened to her narration with a dark expression.\nShao An took stock of the scene and handed the woman two slices of bread.\nShe ate ravenously and said in a daze, “Oh right! They also have special staff to brainwash some of the captured folks so that they are willing to be used.”\nQiu Tong looked down and realized that the terrorist group had an extremely tight management system that would be difficult to break through from the outside.\nIf they wanted to force an attack, they would have to face the problem of innocent civilians getting injured.\nShe recalled one of the methods to surround a group of zombies during the apocalypse and had the idea of pretending to be human traffickers and infiltrating a terrorist organization.\n“Are the movements of the kidnapped people limited to this building? Is there no way to leave?”\nQiu Tong threw out an inexplicable question. The woman shook her head and calmed herself down. Pointing at an electronic ankle device around her ankle, she said, “Only high-level kidnapped people who have been brainwashed can move around outside. They are responsible for buying some daily necessities, vegetables and fruits, as well as looking for other trafficking targets…”\n“To prevent the police or others from sneaking in. They put this special ankle device on us.”\n“It’s developed using the latest technology and materials. Unless you destroy the device or cut off the feet, you’ll never be able to remove it. Only the senior leaders of terrorist groups have the password and method to remove the device…”\n“I’m afraid that I won’t be able to remove it even to the day I die… even if I run to the ends of the world, I won’t be able to escape…”\nThe woman’s eyes were filled with helplessness and resentment. Qiu Tong squatted down and examined the ankle device with interest.\nShao An summoned the best decryption expert in the military. He fiddled with it and triggered the defense system of the device. It indicated that the password was wrong and would explode in five minutes!\nEveryone panicked and retreated while protecting Jin Yang.\nQiu Tong comforted the terrified woman as she examined the device. She stared at the electronic screen and tapped at a few places with her fingertips.\nThe ear-piercing alarm disappeared. Jin Yang pushed the bodyguard away and walked to her side. He stared at Qiu Tong’s actions, his eyes shining with anticipation.\nShe always seemed to be able to surprise him!\nTwo minutes later, with a click, Qiu Tong unlocked the passcode and removed the electronic ankle device, swinging it around…\nQiu Tong glanced at Jin Yang before putting on the ankle device under everyone’s shocked gazes.\nShe smiled playfully and murmured, “Not bad. It’s quite exquisite.”\n“But the password system is just child’s play, it’s very easy to crack.”\nJin Yang frowned at her actions. He seemed to have guessed something and asked anxiously, “What are you planning to do?”",

      "content": "Chapter 53: Persuasion\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\n“I can infiltrate the group and become an undercover agent.”\nEveryone was shocked. They felt that Qiu Tong’s logic was abnormal and her actions were extremely odd.\nQiu Tong explained. “The kidnapped civilians have ankle devices. They obey the terrorist organization because they fear death. I can blend in and help them remove the devices and bombs. I can slowly coax them to defect and work for us.”\n“When the right time comes, the kidnapped civilians will be able to protect themselves and will not be restrained by the terrorist organization. No human bomb will be able to stop us.”\n“If we can convince them to turn against the terrorists, they can even cooperate with you on your plan and wipe the organization out.”\nQiu Tong tilted her head, waiting for Jin Yang to agree.\nThe impression the surrounding soldiers had of Qiu Tong began to change from disdain and contempt, to respect and even a hint of admiration…\nThe atmosphere in the second floor basement became more fervent. They seemed to be able to foresee a great victory and could not help feeling the urge to carry out their mission.\nJin Yang’s breathing was unsteady. His sharp eyes locked onto her figure and his thin lips pursed into a straight line. “No.”\nQiu Tong questioned his ability to command. “Why? This is the best and only way to break through.”\nJin Yang’s gaze turned slightly cold. His low and hoarse voice contained an indescribable nervousness. “There will be other ways.”\nQiu Tong was vexed. She didn’t want to waste any more time. After some thought, she walked over to Jin Yang and grabbed his elbow, pulling him to a quiet corner…\nShao An and his bodyguards formed a human wall five meters away, blocking them from the rest. However, they could not help perking up their ears in curiosity, wanting to hear their conversation. Unfortunately, they were too far away and could not hear anything. They could only secretly guess what Qiu Tong wanted to do!\nAfter interacting with him the past few days, Qiu Tong believed that Jin Yang was a trustworthy person.\nShe was not worried that revealing certain things to him would bring about danger and trouble.\nQiu Tong lowered her head, lifted her shirt and unbuttoned it, revealing her snow-white skin…\nJin Yang was surprised. He looked slightly embarrassed and wanted to shift his gaze away. His throat tightened as he asked, “What are you doing… we are in public!”\nQiu Tong didn’t say anything. She just peeled off her clothes, revealing the wound she’d just received from the explosion.\nAs if she couldn’t feel the pain, she lowered her head and used her palm to cover the wound, transmitting her special ability to heal the wound in front of Jin Yang.\nThe miraculous sight made Jin Yang forget about the erotic scene in front of him. His cold fingers poked the tender flesh on her back, causing Qiu Tong to tremble.\n“Look, I have the ability to protect myself. Even if I infiltrate a terrorist organization, I won’t be in danger.”\nQiu Tong pushed away his hand and met Jin Yang’s eyes. She said seriously, “You know better than anyone else that my plan is the only feasible one, and I can coordinate with you from the inside.”\nJin Yang saw her supernatural power with his own eyes. He recalled that previous incident. If he hadn’t met Qiu Tong, his life would have been in danger.\n“How did you do it?”\n“You have supernatural powers. How did you get them?”\nJin Yang pressed on. Qiu Tong didn’t expect his focus to be on that. She replied half-heartedly, “I was born with it.”\n“I’ve been different from normal children since I was born…”\nQiu Tong changed the topic and pointed at the corpses outside. She said firmly, “If you want to destroy the terrorist organization and let the civilians live free and happy lives, you should agree to my proposal.”\n“Even if I don’t have the ability to protect myself, you should still choose to let me be a spy and exchange one person’s life for the happiness of tens of millions of people. It will be worth it!”\n“I’m your personal bodyguard. You didn’t hire me to hide behind you! I don’t want to be useless!”\n“Jin Yang, do you understand what I mean?”\nQiu Tong’s voice had risen a few octaves and Jin Yang was moved. He finally agreed to her plan.\n“Put your clothes back on.”\nJin Yang reminded Qiu Tong as she stepped out from the dark corner.\nShe bent her head and re-buttoned her ruffled shirt, before tucking it in properly. Her face was still flushed from the heated argument.\nWhen Shao An heard the sounds of movement, he turned his head and happened to see her actions. He was stunned.\n“Sir, you two…”\nShao An’s gaze wandered between the two of them. He stared at the corner and then saw the two red marks on Jin Yang’s neck from the explosion…\nHe could not help but imagine all sorts of amorous images.. Realizing something, Shao An quickly shook his head, not daring to think too much.",

      "content": "Chapter 54: Invitation\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nAfter the ambush failed, Jin Yang instructed Shao An to keep an eye on the underground blackmarket 24/7.\nA few days later, there was indeed some new movement.\nShao An personally led a team to scout the market a few times and obtained a lot of new information. He immediately reported to Jin Yang.\n“Just as you predicted, sir. After things died down, they’re back to trading.”\nAs Shao An spoke, he handed over the intelligence file in his hand.\nJin Yang took over the document and flipped through it seriously. Qiu Tong also went up to him. She gave off a sweet fragrance that made the man’s eyes darken.\nShao An continued, “Many wealthy people can secretly enter and exit the second floor basement using special invitations.”\n“When you meet a ‘slave’ that you like, the rich can buy him or her for any purpose. It doesn’t matter if you end up killing the ‘slave’. And if you get tired of him or her, you can sell the ‘slave’ back to the market at a lower price.”\nAs he spoke, Shao An took out an invitation from his pocket and handed it over. “Sir, this is it.”\nA fair hand took the invitation before Jin Yang did.\n“Sell the ‘slave’ back?”\nQiu Tong playfully brushed the golden words with her fingertips and lifted her eyes to look at Jin Yang. She smiled lightly. “Well then, this ‘slave’ here will be waiting to be sold back by you… Master.”\nIt was clearly just a teasing remark, but from her lips, it sounded seductive, especially when she said “Master.”\nJin Yang’s Adam’s apple bobbed. He lowered his eyes and finally said, “…Be careful.”\nThat night, Qiu Tong put on her ankle device, some makeup and her clothes. She looked at the mirror before pushing the door open.\nJin Yang, who was already prepared outside, heard the sound of the door opening. He looked up and was momentarily stunned. A look of surprise flashed across his eyes.\nQiu Tong, who had always been dressed simply, was now wearing a tight-fitting red dress. Her curvy sexy figure and long legs were very eye-catching.\nWith her exquisite makeup and fiery red lips, she looked extremely alluring and sexy, as if she had become a completely different person.\nQiu Tong whistled. “What’s the matter? Are you dazzled by my beauty?”\n“…”\nJin Yang looked away expressionlessly and cleared his throat. “Let’s go!”\nThey parked the car in the alley and got out of the car. Qiu Tong passed the golden mask to Jin Yang and held his hand in a very natural manner.\nJin Yang’s body stiffened, but he did not shake her off.\nWhen they reached the second level basement, they were surrounded by smoke. The doorman stopped them and Jin Yang took out his invitation letter and handed it over.\nAfter checking the invitation, the doorman chuckled and led them into the long corridor.\nThere were bodyguards and thugs armed with guns along the way. Security was tight.\nThe music in the venue was deafening. The lights were dim, and smoke filled the air. The smell of cosmetics, alcohol and sweat mixed together.\nIt was crowded and the atmosphere was chaotic.\nQiu Tong looked around, trying to remember the layout.\nRight at this moment, a wretched voice suddenly sounded beside them.\n“Yo, mister, are you here to sell your slave?”\n“I like your slave!”\nQiu Tong followed the voice and saw a fat, greasy middle-aged man wearing a pig mask. He reeked of alcohol.\nHe stared straight at Qiu Tong and walked over with a lecherous look, smacking his lips.\n“What a stunner. I’ve been in this market for years, but I’ve never seen such a slave.”\n“Sir, you are probably tired of it already. It’ll be troublesome to sell it back. That’s perfect. The two of us can just do an exchange. My slave may not have as good a figure as yours, but she’s very good in bed. Hehehe.”\nThe greasy man let out a wretched laugh and stretched out his hand towards Qiu Tong’s hips. “Let me try out the quality of this…”\nQiu Tong’s eyes flickered coldly. Just as the greasy pig’s hand was about to reach her, she broke it.\nJust as she was about to attack, Jin Yang, who was beside her, took a big step forward, his tall and sturdy back blocking her.\nJin Yang’s eyes were cold as he stretched out his right hand to grab the pig’s hand.\nThe greasy man was stunned. Thinking that Jin Yang wanted to shake his hand, he smiled happily.\n“Hehe, good deal, good deal.”\nUnexpectedly, in the next second, a cold glint flashed across Jin Yang’s eyes and he instantly tightened his grip.\n“Ahhhh!!”\nThe man’s scream was drowned out by the music.. In the next second, Jin Yang raised his leg and kicked his chest. The man’s fat body fell heavily to the ground and he spat out a mouthful of blood!",

The owner of this place and I…”\nBefore he finished speaking, Jin Yang shot Shao An a look. Shao An took out a check from his pocket and wrote a number before tossing it over.\n“I don’t care who you are. Take the money and scram.”\n“I don’t care about your money…”\nThe greasy man cursed but inadvertently glanced at the check. He was taken aback.\nUnder the dim light, he could clearly see that there were several zeros behind the numbers.\n“Hundred, hundred thousand, million…”\nThe greasy man quietly swallowed his saliva and looked at Shao An again. The figure in front of him was abnormally tall and sturdy, and his aura was extraordinary. Since he could give away so much money, he was definitely not someone to be trifled with.\nHe immediately changed his attitude and said with a flattering smile, “So you’re a big shot. I was really stupid to actually dare to offend you…”\nThe greasy man took the check, still muttering, “But I can’t believe it. It’s just a toy. I can’t believe he cares so much…”\nJin Yang stared at the man from above with a straight face. The coldness in his eyes could kill.\n“I’m warning you, she’s not a toy.”\n“Yes, yes, yes. I have a foul mouth. I misspoke!”\nCold sweat trickled down the greasy man’s back. He lowered his head and apologized profusely.\n“Then get lost!”\nShao An glared fiercely at the greasy man. The greasy man fled without daring to make another sound.\nJin Yang’s expression was dark and cold.\nThis surprised Shao An.\nHe had been under Jin Yang for many years. No matter what happened, he would never reveal his emotions.\nFor this Qiu Tong, he actually…\nQiu Tong did not notice Shao An’s strange expression. She surveyed the interior. “After I control the situation inside, I will make a red mark on the necks of the ‘slaves’ during the auction.”\nNo red mark would mean nothing had changed.\n“Okay”\nJin Yang nodded. “Be careful.”\nQiu Tong smiled. “I won’t allow anything to happen to me.”\nIn the post-apocalyptic era, she was a major general after all. She had killed thousands of zombies. How could these few terrorists be her match?\nJin Yang pursed his lips and didn’t say anything else. He followed the plan and brought Qiu Tong to the staff.\nWith Qiu Tong’s pitiful status as ‘slave’, plus her good figure and beauty, she was quickly sold back. She was brought back to the slave den.\nThe slave den was in the basement. Qiu Tong was shocked by what she saw.\nThe basement was as big as two basketball courts, and there were no partitions. Apart from young women like her, the rest were mostly old, weak, sick and disabled. Everyone’s clothes were ragged, and their expressions were dazed.\nThere were strong men, too, although everyone appeared to be suffering from varying degrees of injury. The air smelled stale.\nQiu Tong frowned and decided to wait and see.\nWhen it was time for dinner, the guards carried two large buckets of steamed buns to the door. “Eat, you animals.”\nThe slaves snatched at the buns like crazy!\nQiu Tong had successfully snatched two steamed buns and was walking back when a boy suddenly flew in front of her, having been kicked by someone.\nA burly man walked over. “Hand over the steamed bun and I won’t hit you!”\n“I won’t… Ah—”\nThe little boy did not give in. He firmly protected the steamed bun in his hand.\nThe burly man was enraged and started punching and kicking the little boy. The little boy’s nose and mouth were covered in blood…\nThe scene was very cruel, but the surrounding slaves were busy wolfing down the food that they had snatched. The other slaves who had not managed to snatch anything were watching anxiously. No one came forward to help.\nThis scene reminded Qiu Tong of her three children.\nWhen the three children were with the former owner of her body, they didn’t have enough to eat, no warm clothes to wear, and were bullied. They were just like the little boy in front of her.\nShe wondered how they were doing now.\nQiu Tong stepped up with a frown. “It’s your own fault you didn’t manage to get any buns yourself. Why are you trying to snatch his?”\n“Ignorant fool, get lost!”\nThe burly man flew into a rage and threw a punch at her. Qiu Tong dodged it perfectly.\nQiu Tong smirked and grabbed the man’s hand, throwing him over her shoulder. “You should be the one getting lost!”\n“You…”\nThe burly man wanted to stand up again, but Qiu Tong stepped on him ruthlessly.\nHe gritted his teeth and said fiercely, “Just you wait!”\nIf not for his four broken ribs, how could this b*tch be his match?\nQiu Tong ignored his venomous gaze and kicked him away, dusting off her hands. “I’ll be waiting!”",

His hands were dripping with blood, his flesh all swollen. It was a terrifying sight.\nQiu Tong was shocked and handed her steamed bun to him.\n“I’ll give you mine.”\nThe little boy ignored her and stared at the ground with clenched fists.\nQiu Tong wanted to pat his head. “Go ahead and eat. I’m here. I won’t let them bully you.”\nThe little boy cautiously leaned against the corner of the wall. Qiu Tong was close enough to hear that the little boy was breathing heavily.\nShe reached out to touch the boy’s forehead. “You have a fever?”\nThe little boy had no strength to push her and scolded her in disdain, “Don’t touch me! It’s none of your business!”\nHe was really similar to Qiu Xingyuan.\nQiu Tong thought that since she had already gotten involved with him, how could she not care?\nQiu Tong touched the boy’s forehead and used her power to heal his wounds.\n“By the way, what’s your name?”\nThe little boy’s face was gloomy. He did not reply to her words nor eat her food.\nQiu Tong noticed that the little boy was very vigilant towards her. After confirming that he was not in danger for the time being, she ignored him and continued to observe her surroundings.\nHowever, she did not expect to see the birthmark of a crabapple on the back of the boy’s neck.\nQiu Tong was stunned.\nThe boy with the crabapple birthmark…\nIn the novel she had read before the post-apocalyptic war, the male protagonist, Ye Luan, had a birthmark of a crabapple on the back of his neck!\nYe Luan? This child?\nShe remembered that Ye Luan was an orphan. He had a reclusive personality and a tragic background. However, the novel did not mention that Ye Luan came from a slave den.\nBy the time he appeared in the novel, it would be ten years later. He had grown up to be a gloomy and fearsome young man.\nIn the span of ten years, Ye Luan would experience countless bloody crises. It was no wonder that his final blow would be so cruel. He did not hesitate at all when dealing with her children.\nQiu Tong made up her mind to protect Ye Luan.\nNot only that, she also wanted to bring him back to get along with her three children. After they develop feelings for each other, he would definitely not kill them.\nAt the thought of this, Qiu Tong leaned closer to Ye Luan and said domineeringly, “Child, I’ll protect you from now on. I won’t let anyone bully you again, understand?”\nYe Luan was still indifferent to her words.\nHowever, there were a few slaves who started mocking them mercilessly. “Everyone, listen to this. This woman is speaking nonsense!”\n“You are a prey locked in a cage, yet you boast about protecting others!”\n“If you ask me, she’s an idiot. She can’t even protect herself, yet she wants to drag along an even weaker piece of trash! Everyone, stay away from them. Let her die on her own. Don’t bring us along!”\nYe Luan tensed up at the crowd’s ridicule. He was used to being despised and bullied these days.\nQiu Tong was the only person who showed kindness to him, but she ended up being mocked by them.\nHe stared coldly at the person who had just spoken.\n“Hey, you little brat!”\nThe other party was annoyed by his stare. He stood up and wanted to give him a slap. “How dare you glare at me?! I’ll beat you to death!”\nYe Luan didn’t dodge. He looked up at that person, as if wanting to memorize his face.\nOne day, he would return the favor to all those who had bullied him.\nYe Luan was already prepared to be slapped, but this time, the slap did not land on his face.\nWhen that person approached, Qiu Tong suddenly made a move and kicked him in the stomach. She said coldly, “I’ve already said that he’s someone I’m protecting. Don’t you understand?”\nThat person was sent flying and rolled on the ground in pain while clutching his stomach.\nThe slaves had never seen such a fierce woman before. For a moment, they couldn’t quite figure her out. No one dared to step forward again. No one dared to make trouble for Ye Luan again.\nQiu Tong turned and gave Ye Luan a kind smile. “It’s alright now, go to sleep.”\nYe Luan, “…”\nHe watched with a conflicted expression as Qiu Tong took the initiative to shield him behind her. After a long while, he silently closed his eyes in the darkness.\nThe next day, Qiu Tong was woken up by wretched cries.\nQiu Tong opened her eyes and saw several guards trying to pull a little girl out. “Let’s go! It’s your turn to go to the auction today!”\nThe little girl was so frightened that she cried loudly and reached out to a woman. “Mommy, save me…”\nThe woman was in a panic. She grabbed the child’s hand with all her might. “Sirs! Please, she’s just a child… please, she can’t be sold!”\nIn the next second, the woman was pushed down and beaten up violently. “Do you think you can do whatever you want now that you are here? Be good and follow me onto the stage to wait for a master to bid on you. Otherwise, I’ll beat you to death right now!”",

She even used all her strength to crawl towards her daughter and reached out her bloody hand to grab her. “Baby, Mommy is here…”\n“Ah!!!”\nThe woman screamed.\nThe guards stepped impatiently on the back of her hand and strung her up. They then flashed their whips and whipped the woman hard.\nSmack! Smack!\nThe whip made a terrible sound, and even the slaves who were watching seemed to feel it and begged for mercy in fear.\n“Sir, please spare them. They just don’t know the rules yet!”\n“If you kill them now, you won’t have any money. They can only be sold for a good price if they’re alive!”\nSlaves were killed in the slave den every day. Either they were killed by the other slaves or they were tortured to death by these perverted guards.\nThe tragic state of the mother and daughter touched the crowd.\nHowever, their pleas were completely useless to the guards. They even turned on them. “Who are you to speak here? Scram! Or I’ll beat you all up!”\nSoon, several guards brought their guns and surrounded the slaves to prevent them from moving forward.\nThose people huddled together, not daring to move again.\nBefore long, the woman fainted from the whipping, and their daughter was forcibly taken away.\nSilence soon returned to the basement. The slaves had witnessed the entire mother-daughter episode, and they were silently suppressing their emotions that were about to erupt.\nAll of them wanted to tear these guards apart, but what could they do?\nQiu Tong pursed her lips and said in silence, “Every day, you’re either sold or bullied by these guards. Have you never thought of escaping together?”\nThe slaves looked at her as if she were a lunatic. “Escape? Everyone is injured. How can we escape?”\n“There’s also the device tied to our ankles. We’ll probably be blasted into meat paste before we reach the door!”\nQiu Tong muttered, “I know how to cure injuries…”\n“Tsk, stop bullshitting.”\nQiu Tong was interrupted before she could finish.\nThe burly man, Kai En, whom she had stepped on yesterday, looked at her mockingly. “Stupid woman, is there something wrong with your brain?! You keep saying such crazy things. Do you really think you’re invincible?”\nQiu Tong knew that if she did not cure one of them in public today, these slaves would not believe her.\nShe smirked and said coldly, “You don’t believe me? Come and try then.”\nKai En still did not believe her. “Don’t bring up all our hopes just to drop us into despair. If we can’t escape as you said, everyone will tear you apart!”\nWhat a joke. She was just a woman. How could she know these things?\nFurthermore, there was no medicine in the slave den. Under such circumstances, how could she cure them?\nEveryone’s emotions were stirred up by Kai En. “Yes! Shut up! Even if you can cure our injuries, can you also remove our ankle devices?!”\nIn the face of everyone’s anger, Qiu Tong remained calm.\n“It’s just an explosive device, I can dismantle it. The more people there are, the more power we have. If we are no longer injured, there’s no need to fear those few guards anymore.”\nWith that, Qiu Tong locked her gaze on Kai En. “You claim that I cannot cure your injuries. Do you dare to try?”\n“I…”\nBefore Kai En could say anything else, Qiu Tong walked toward him and raised her hand—\nRip!\nShe tore open Kai En’s shirt, exposing the wound in his abdomen. She pressed against his ribs. “Four broken ribs? I think they’re cracked.”\n“Ow!!!”\nKai En howled in pain and swung his fist at Qiu Tong. “B*tch, I think you want to kill me!”\nQiu Tong easily caught his fist before tearing off a corner of his shirt. She rubbed the injured area with her hand before bandaging it.\n“B*tch! Are you crazy? There’s no medicine. What’s the use of just bandaging my wound… eh?”\nKai En cried out. But a strange sensation at his injured area shut him up.\nThe original pain was replaced by a warm feeling. He was shocked and pressed his ribs in surprise. “Strange… it really doesn’t hurt anymore?”\nQiu Tong raised an eyebrow.\nKai En was overjoyed, while the other slaves were stunned.\nQiu Tong was very pleased with the slaves’ reaction. She waited for them to take the initiative and step forward, but to her surprise, a fierce light began to fill Kai En’s eyes.\n“B*tch, I was injured last time and so didn’t beat you up. This time, I’ll let you know how powerful I am!”",

      "content": "Chapter 58: Stirring Trouble\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nKai En still remembered how Qiu Tong had humiliated him yesterday and was about to teach her a lesson!\nQiu Tong did not hide or panic. When he charged at her, she just tilted her head and dodged. She grabbed his hand and easily threw him over her shoulder!\nIn the next second, Qiu Tong was strangling his throat!\nThe smile on her lips was very cold. “I just cured you and you’re already repaying kindness with ingratitude, huh? Let me see how powerful you are.”\nKai En found it difficult to breathe as Qiu Tong used all her strength to choke him.\n“Cough cough… I…was wrong… let go, let go…”\nIn that instant, Kai En felt his head swell and his eyes sting, as if he were going to die the next second.\nHe could only beg for mercy.\nUnexpectedly, even after he recovered, he was still no match for Qiu Tong!\nThe slaves were stunned by this scene and backed off one by one, intimidated by the murderous aura that Qiu Tong exuded.\nKai En struggled to pry Qiu Tong’s hand away. “Let me go… I promise not to hurt you. I… cough cough… I respect you as my boss. My brothers will listen to you…”\nFrom the looks of it, this person had some status in the slave den?\n“Sure, you have to obey me then.”\nQiu Tong had a plan and kicked him away. “But remember, I can cure you, but I can also cripple you. If you play any tricks on me, I promise you’ll die a horrible death!”\nKai En’s heart lurched and cold sweat ran down his back.\nHe could feel Qiu Tong’s powerful aura. How would he dare to go against her now?\nKai En quickly adjusted his attitude. “Boss, you’re so strong. What tricks will I dare to play?”\n“It better be that way.”\nQiu Tong had run out of patience and coldly commanded, “Now, you go and stand guard. The rest of you wait in line for treatment.”\n“There’s one thing I want to make clear first. After I treat you guys, you still have to pretend to be injured in front of outsiders. Don’t let anyone see through this.”\nKai En quickly nodded. “Yes, Boss!”\nThe slaves soon lined up under Kai En’s management.\nOne treated slave after another left the long line. All of them were now determined to follow Qiu Tong’s lead.\n“Thank you for saving us. From now on, you are our boss!”\nJust like that, Qiu Tong became the new leader of the slave den!\nThis was all part of Qiu Tong’s plan.\nBut on the third day, she realized that things had become a little tricky.\nAs there was not enough food in the basement, her special ability could not be replenished, and her ability to use it was limited. She had only treated a few people today, and she already had a headache.\nQiu Tong waved her hand tiredly. “From today onwards, we have to limit the number of people. Only 20 patients per day.”\nUpon hearing this, those who hadn’t received treatment immediately panicked and became furious.\n“What?! Are you trying to fool us? Only 20 people per day but there are hundreds of us in total. How long will this take?”\nThe slaves had been held here too long. Someone was being tortured to death every single day. They all feared death.\nThey had placed all their hopes on Qiu Tong, hoping to get out as soon as possible, but now Qiu Tong wanted to restrict the treatment!\n“People are being taken away every day. If you don’t treat us all quickly, what if the guards choose me?!”\n“You told us that you could treat our injuries and bring us out, but it’s been two days, and we still haven’t been treated! I think you just want to use this gimmick to stabilize your position in the slave den, right?”\nThose people stared angrily at Qiu Tong, as if she was not their benefactor but their enemy.\nQiu Tong smirked. “Tell me, what’s the benefit of being the boss of the slave den?”\nThe slaves choked from her rebuttal. After a while, they retorted stubbornly, “You will have people working for you and serving you!”\n“Is that so? In the three days that I’ve been here, has anyone even poured me a cup of water? Or snatched a steamed bun for me?”\nQiu Tong’s gaze was cold. “Since you think that I have other motives, from today onwards, there will be no more treatment. Everything will go back to normal.”\nWhen she said that she wasn’t going to treat them anymore, most people were shocked.\nEven if Qiu Tong’s treatment pace was slow, they would still have a chance of recovering. If Qiu Tong refused to treat them, it would be all over for them.\n“What are you guys talking about! What did Boss manage to gain from you guys? She wanted to bring everyone out, but you turned around and attacked her instead!”\n“Are you shameless? You want her to cure you even as you are scolding her?!”\n“If you don’t want to be cured, then get lost. There are those of us who still want treatment!”\nThe slaves who valued the benefits stood out to defend Qiu Tong, while those who were just stirring trouble immediately lost their blustering stance.\nThe other slaves also chose to keep quiet.\nQiu Tong took the opportunity to say, “The number of injured people is increasing every day, and new slaves are also being thrown in. I am just one person here. So I’ve decided to treat those who can fight and have stronger bodies first.”\nThis would also be better for them to counterattack while escaping.\nThe slaves had no objections to this suggestion.\nIn the following period of time, Qiu Tong acted according to plan.",

      "content": "Chapter 59: I Won’t Forgive This Bad Woman Too\nMeanwhile, at the three children’s side.\nToday was the seventh day, which was the day Qiu Tong had promised that she would return.\nQiu Xingyu did not even go to kindergarten. She waited for Qiu Xingyu at the doorway, wanting to give her a big hug.\nHowever, Qiu Tong was still in the slave den making plans for the next day with the slaves. Even though she was anxious to return, there was nothing she could do.\nQiu Xingyu waited from morning till night, her eyes filled with anticipation and disappointment.\nQiu Xingyuan even specially bought fish and meat. He was unwilling to admit that he was also expecting her.\nSeeing Qiu Xingyu’s dejected look, Qiu Xingyuan’s expression became increasingly gloomy.\nFinally, he carried Little Yu back. “Don’t wait anymore, she won’t come back!”\nIt was already past one in the morning. If she wanted to come back, she would have done so long ago.\nThat woman must have run off with some man and abandoned them!\n“But Mommy said today…”\nQiu Xingyu sobbed. Her mommy had changed for the better. Before she left, she even planted a kiss on her forehead.\nShe said that she would buy her a beautiful dress and delicious cake.\nQiu Xingyuan recalled the changes Qiu Tong had undergone during this period of time and clenched his small fists tightly.\nHe knew Qiu Tong wouldn’t be so nice!\n“Little Yu, Little Qiao, forget about this woman. She was good to us just to lower our guard so that we won’t pester her when she leaves!”\nQiu Xingyu and Qiu Xingqiao thought about it and looked at the clock. They were instantly deflated.\nQiu Xingyu’s tears fell one by one.\nQiu Xingqiao’s eyes were also red. He bit his lips stubbornly and said fiercely, “Elder Brother, even if she comes back, I won’t forgive this liar!”\nThey had thought that the family of four could live well together. In the end, Qiu Tong cruelly abandoned them and even lied to them.\n“Yes, I will never forgive this bad woman.”\nQiu Xingyuan said in a low voice, “In the future, I will earn money to take care of you guys. From tomorrow onwards, we won’t be going to kindergarten anymore.”\nQiu Tong was the one who arranged for them to go to kindergarten. If not for Qiu Tong, they would not want to be with a bunch of silly kids.\n“Okay.”\nQiu Xingyu and Qiu Xingqiao nodded in unison.\nWith Qiu Tong gone, the three of them had to be united. Things had been very hard for Elder Brother, they could not disappoint him!\n…\nQiu Tong had already come up with a plan. She calculated that there were 300 people who had been cured.\nThe guards would not be a match for their attack tomorrow night.\nAt this moment, Qiu Tong gathered everyone together and removed their ankle devices one by one. Then, she easily modified the explosive devices with a knife.\n“If you don’t press the button, the device will not explode. However, you still have to wear the devices on your ankles. I will give you instructions tomorrow. When the time comes, take off the device and toss it out.”\nIn order not to arouse the suspicions of the guards, they had to do this.\nThe slaves had witnessed the whole process of Qiu Tong removing the ankle devices with her bare hands. They were completely impressed by her.\nThey obeyed her orders without qualms now.\n“Someone is coming!”\nThe slaves on the lookout shouted anxiously, and the crowd quickly dispersed.\nSoon, three guards came in.\nThey glanced at Qiu Tong before grabbing Ye Luan, who was beside her.\nQiu Tong quickly stood up. “What are you doing?”\nYe Luan was the male protagonist of that novel. Even if something happened to her, nothing must happen to Ye Luan. Otherwise, her three children might suffer if the storyline changed?\nOne of the guards shouted at Qiu Tong, “What does it have to do with you?! Get lost! You guys, take him away!”\nQiu Tong clenched her fists and suppressed her anger.\nIf she were to hit someone now, her entire plan would be ruined.\nHowever, she could not just watch as Ye Luan was taken away. She walked forward and lowered her voice. “Don’t be afraid, I will save you.”\nShe quickly cut her finger with a small knife. She then touched Ye Luan’s neck and quietly drew a cross on his skin.\nThis was a signal to the people outside.\nYe Luan looked at her expressionlessly. Although he didn’t believe her words, there was still a slight flutter in his heart.\nHe had also heard about her plan. It was indeed feasible.\nHowever, most of the slaves that were brought out never returned.\nAnd now, he was the one being taken away…\nQiu Tong was currently locked up in the slave den. He would be dead by tomorrow night’s auction.\nBefore Ye Luan was taken away, Qiu Tong suddenly said, “Do what you want.”\n“…”\nQiu Tong’s heart skipped a beat. Her fingers dug into her palms as she watched with cold eyes, Ye Luan being taken away.\nShe told herself that no matter what, nothing must happen to Ye Luan.",

In just a while, we’ll lure the guards over. Remember, you must act quickly.”\nHowever, two minutes after she spoke, more guards arrived.\nThey grabbed a bunch of slaves.\nThey then left behind ten guards, all with guns in their hands.\nIt seemed like the terrorists had brought the auction forward.\nLet’s begin!\nQiu Tong made a gesture and shot the rest a look, the slaves quickly took off their ankle devices and threw them at the ten guards!\n“Get down!”\nQiu Tong shouted at the top of her lungs.\nWith a loud bang, the guards were blown apart!\nAt the same time, the metal door exploded!\nQiu Tong raised her hand, and the slaves launched their attack, charging out.\nWhen the other terrorists heard the commotion, they rushed over. When the cured slaves saw them, their eyes turned red and they all charged forward.\nThose who were cured were strong and could fight. There were hundreds of them and the small number of terrorists were no match for them.\nMost importantly, Jin Yang had rushed in with his men.\nEver since Qiu Tong entered the slave den, he would come here every day, and he saw the red mark on Ye Luan’s body tonight.\nIn less than three minutes, the slave den were already littered with the dead bodies of the terrorists.\nQiu Tong smiled when she saw Jin Yang walk in with a gun.\nIndeed, he did not disappoint her.\nA gratified smile appeared on Jin Yang’s face. She did not disappoint him either!\nJust like that, the slave den was occupied by Jin Yang and Qiu Tong.\nJin Yang frowned when he saw the large number of slaves standing behind Qiu Tong, all of them covered in bloodstains. He gave Shao An an order.\n“Take care of these people and send them back to their hometown. If they don’t have a home, send them to the welfare center.”\nYe Luan had no family, so he had to be sent to the welfare center.\nYe Luan’s face was cold, he was unwilling to go.\nHe had been saved by Jin Yang and rushed in with them. Now, it was time to settle the affairs of the slaves, but Ye Luan refused to accept his fate.\nHe instinctively ran behind Qiu Tong and grabbed her sleeve.\nAlthough he did not say anything, his actions showed everything.\nQiu Tong shielded Ye Luan behind her. “I have no objections to your resettlement plan, but this child has to stay by my side. I plan to adopt him.”\nIf she adopted Ye Luan, he and her three children would be siblings.\nIf they were to cultivate their relationship now, wouldn’t they be able to grow rich together later on?\n“No, this is against the rules.” Shao An immediately stood out and objected.\nEveryone who came out of the slave den had to be accounted for to the government. In addition, Qiu Tong was a single mother with three children. The adoption process would probably not be approved.\nShao An still wanted to say something, but Jin Yang spoke up. “You will make this happen.”\n“…”\nShao An could only watch as their President once again changed his principles for Qiu Tong. He had no choice but to nod his head in agreement.\nThe slaves reluctantly bid farewell to Qiu Tong.\nQuests heaved a sigh of relief and brought Ye Luan back to the villa to pack her things. Her mission had been completed and it was time for her to reunite with her three children!\nShe was about to leave with her things, but she saw herself in the mirror.\nWouldn’t her current appearance scare the three children to tears?\nNo, no.\nQiu Tong left Ye Luan in the bedroom and went to the bathroom.\nAfter she took off her clothes and turned on the shower, she realized that there was nothing in the bathroom.\n“…”\nHe was a person of such high status. But his guest room was so poorly furnished that there wasn’t any shower gel or even a towel!\n“Ye Luan, are you there?”\nShe had no choice but to shout Ye Luan’s name.\nYe Luan’s cold voice rang outside the door. “What is it?”\n“Help me get my shower gel and towel from my luggage.”\nIf she hadn’t been so anxious, she wouldn’t have forgotten to bring them in!\n“Okay.”\nYe Luan replied indifferently. He walked towards Qiu Tong’s packed luggage which was locked by a passcode. He squatted down to study it.\nHowever, he had never seen this thing before, so he was unable to open it no matter how he tried.\nJust as he was about to ask Qiu Tong to come out and get it herself, Ye Luan heard the sound of the door being pushed open. In the next second, he saw Jin Yang, who was dressed in a black suit, walking in from outside with a document in his hand.\nThe two of them exchanged chilly looks. Neither of them had the intention of speaking to each other.\n“Ye Luan, have you found my shower gel and towel?”\nQiu Tong prompted Ye Luan. “Oh, I forgot to tell you. The password is 61xxxxxxx.”\nYe Luan pursed his lips, looking gloomy.\nWhy didn’t she say so earlier?\nJin Yang didn’t say anything. He squatted down and opened the luggage.\nHe found the shower gel and towel, but when he pulled it out, his fingers accidentally hooked onto a black fabric.\nJin Yang’s face darkened when he pulled it out.\nIt was a pair of lacy underwear…",

The surging blood made him dizzy for a moment.\nHe shook his head to calm himself down and was about to put the underwear back into the luggage.\nAt this moment, the bathroom door opened.\nQiu Tong waited for a long time but did not hear Ye Luan’s reply. She opened the door slightly and popped out her wet head.\n“Ye Luan, you…”\nQiu Tong’s words trailed off at the sight of the lacy underwear in Jin Yang’s hands. Their eyes met and an awkward atmosphere spread throughout the room.\nJin Yang, “…”\nQiu Tong, “…”\nYe Luan, “…”\nIn the end, it was Jin Yang who broke the silence first. He pretended to be calm and put the underwear back into the luggage. He calmly took out the shower gel and towel and strode towards Qiu Tong.\nBeneath that calm facade, he was the only one who knew how embarrassed he actually was.\nQiu Tong reached out her fair arm through the crack of the door and took the toiletries from his hands. She was about to say something when she slipped and fell forward!\nShe was holding the items in her hands and was unable to break her fall. Just as she was about to make contact with the floor, a huge force suddenly came from behind her.\nJin Yang quickly pulled her toward him and wrapped his long arms around her slender waist from behind. His big, hot hands happened to land on her chest, holding her tightly in his arms.\n“You!”\nEmbarrassment and anger flashed across Qiu Tong’s eyes. She hurriedly used a towel to cover her chest and broke free from his embrace. She abruptly pushed him out of the bathroom and slammed the door shut!\nShe stood under the shower and quickly washed her body, as if she wanted to wash away the fluttering in her heart.\nJin Yang looked at the door that almost bashed into his nose and smelled the lingering fragrance in his arms. Still feeling the smoothness of her skin on his fingertips, he touched his nose guiltily.\nHe thought of the beautiful image he had just seen and his heart started beating uncontrollably.\nJin Yang felt that he couldn’t stay here any longer and turned to leave.\nAfter taking a few steps, he seemed to have thought of something and retreated again. He scrutinized Ye Luan, this young man who was only half his age. Suddenly, he raised his hand and grabbed Ye Luan’s collar, dragging him out of the room.\nQiu Tong tidied herself up and walked out of the villa. Shao An had already been waiting at the door with Ye Luan for a long time.\n“Miss Qiu, this is the rest of the payment. Also, this is a cheque for an extra $150,000 that Sir asked me to pay you.”\nShao An pushed Ye Luan to Qiu Tong’s side and took out the cheque. He handed it to Qiu Tong. Filled with burning curiosity and thirsty for gossip, he lowered his head and asked softly.\n“By right, Sir should have seen you off personally. Did you two have a fight?”\nQiu Tong looked at the cheque and smirked. She kept it.\nShe had just been taken advantage of and had no qualms accepting this extra payment.\n“That’s because he saw something he shouldn’t have seen. Your boss is feeling guilty.”\nSeeing her response and recalling the expression on his boss’ face when he asked him to give her another $150,000, realization dawned upon him.\nWhat else could happen between a man and a woman?\nThey must have…\nHowever, Sir was really generous. Giving her a $150,000 tip just for sex.\nShao An mulled over this as he saw Qiu Tong out of the villa.\nAfter Qiu Tong left the villa with Ye Luan, the first thing she did was head straight to the market.\nBefore she left, there was nearly nothing left in the cupboards of their house. Hence, the moment she entered the market, she went on a major buying spree.\nYe Luan received countless shopping bags with a blank expression and followed closely behind her.\nWas this woman going to buy the entire market?\nQiu Tong hefted the haunches of a pig on her shoulders and finally stopped her crazy shopping spree. Carrying a huge amount of stuff, she led Ye Luan back home.\nAt the door, Qiu Tong tried three times, but she could not fit the key in.\nDid the kids change the locks?\nDid something happen during her absence?\nShe became anxious at the thought. She took out a dagger from her waist and drew a steel wire from the handle.\nThe lock suddenly turned and the door opened.\nWhen the three children in the room saw Qiu Tong, they looked as if they were facing a formidable enemy. There was not a hint of joy on their faces at their reunion.\nWhen Qiu Xingyuan saw Ye Luan, his face turned completely black. He gripped a remote control tightly in his hands.",

He pressed a button forcefully and an ear-piercing alarm pierced the sky.\nA few figures instantly broke through the window, their huge fists swinging as they quickly attacked Qiu Tong!\nThey were the mercenaries!\nQiu Tong immediately raised her hand to block, and the few of them quickly engaged in a chaotic battle.\nKe Le and the others did not show any mercy. Their fists were vicious as they brought out their full strength against their opponent.\nQiu Tong’s eyes were profound as she leaped backwards and somersaulted out of the eye of the storm.\nShe spun to stand behind Ke Le, her arm coming in at an odd angle from under her ribs. Her fist went straight for Ke Le’s jaw.\nKe Le took two steps back and Qiu Tong immediately lunged forward, pinning his arms behind his back. She used her weight and momentum to throw the man to the ground, her slender fingers gripping his throat.\n“Boss?”\nKe Le finally saw Qiu Tong’s face and cried out in alarm.\nThe others stopped what they were doing and turned on the lights. The room was brightened.\nQiu Tong let go of Ke Le and stood up, looking back at the kids.\n“Qiu Xingyuan, why did you sound the alarm just now?”\nQiu Tong looked at Qiu Xingyuan with an unfathomable expression and scrutinized him.\nQiu Xingyuan’s heart was in turmoil. He turned his head to avoid Qiu Tong’s gaze and stiffly found an excuse.\n“I was mistaken just now. I thought it was a bad person barging in.”\nQiu Tong raised her eyebrows. She did not expose his lie, but she found it strange.\nBefore she left, she felt that her relationship with the children had improved. Why did it seem like things had returned to their original state after a few days?\n“Where have you been for so many days?”\nQiu Xingyuan stubbornly wanted to get the truth from Qiu Tong.\n“Didn’t I tell you? Mommy went to borrow some money from relatives.”\nQiu Xingyu placed the bags on the table and carried Qiu Xingyu, who was hugging her thigh in joy. “Look, I bought all this meat. Tonight, we’ll have a feast.”\nQiu Xingyu clapped her chubby hands and hugged Qiu Tong’s neck affectionately, shouting loudly.\n“Mommy is the best!”\nQiu Xingyuan lowered his head, his thick eyelashes blocking the disappointment in his eyes.\nThere was no truth in this woman’s words.\nQiu Tong pushed Ye Luan towards the three children.\n“Come, let me introduce everyone. This is Ye Luan. He’s two years older than Qiu Xingyuan. You guys have to call him Big Brother, do you understand?”\n“From today onwards, he will live with us. You have to treat your brother well and have him familiarize himself with this family as soon as possible.”\nQiu Xingyuan abruptly raised his head, his sharp gaze landing on Ye Luan’s face.\nThis woman actually brought back a new pet after going out for a while!\nQiu Xingqiao felt slightly uncomfortable in his heart as well. It had been a long and difficult process for Qiu Tong to finally show concern for them and stop scolding them all the time. Now, a random kid had suddenly appeared to reap the benefits.\nYe Luan met Qiu Xingyuan’s eyes and saw the displeasure in them.\nQiu Xingyu pursed her lips and stepped away from Qiu Tong. She stood to the side, aggrieved and silent.\nQiu Tong glanced at their expressions and laughed in her heart. As expected, they were still just children.\nShe took out the small blanket that she had prepared for Ye Luan from her bag and spread it out in Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao’s room.\n“Ye Luan, you will sleep in this room with Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao from now on.”\n“I’ll go prepare dinner. Go and play.”\nQiu Tong patted Ye Luan’s head and started to organize the supplies she had brought back.\nFive burly men and four children. Plus she herself was a glutton.\nHowever, as soon as Qiu Xingqiao left the room, Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao’s expressions changed. They looked at Ye Luan with gloomy eyes…\nAfter a while, Qiu Tong, who had just thrown the meat into the pot, heard the sounds of fighting coming from inside the house.\nShe quickly walked to the door of the boys’ room. She saw Qiu Xingqiao throw out the blanket that she had just laid out, and fighting with Ye Luan!\nQiu Xingqiao had some abrasions on his body. The corners of Ye Luan’s eyes and mouth were also swollen and bruised.\nMeanwhile, Qiu Xingyuan was just standing at the side with his arms crossed and watching. His eyes were fixed on Ye Luan. If Qiu Xingqiao lost, he would join the fight without any hesitation.\nQiu Tong stood at the door in a daze, looking at the chaotic scene in front of her. Her head ached.\nThis Ye Luan was the male protagonist. And this villain Qiu Xingqiao actually dared to fight with him. Wasn’t he afraid of being punished?!\nQiu Tong snapped.\n“Qiu Xingqiao, stop!”\n“I told you two to treat your brother well, but what are you doing!”\n“Hurry up and apologize!”",

      "content": "Chapter 63: Running Away From Home\nQiu Tong’s words made Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao even more certain that Ye Luan was her new favorite.\nAll her attention was on this person, and she no longer had any feelings for them.\nEver since Qiu Tong decided not to sell them off, Qiu Xingqiao had never heard her reprimand him with such a harsh tone. At this moment, all the grievances in his heart surged.\nHe glared at Qiu Tong before turning around and running out. Even his back profile appeared to be filled with resentment and anger.\n“Xingqiao!”\nQiu Xingyuan looked at Qiu Tong with a pained expression and ran out after Qiu Xingqiao.\n“Elder Brother, Second Brother, wait for me!”\nQiu Xingyu panicked and chased after her brothers.\nQiu Xingqiao did not expect Qiu Xingqiao to have such a huge reaction. She rubbed her temples weakly and turned to look at Ye Luan, who was standing by the side with his fists clenched. She sighed silently.\n“Stay home and be a good boy. Let Uncle Ke Le treat your injuries. I’ll go find the others.”\nQiu Tong headed in the general direction where the children had run off, asking bystanders on the way if they had seen the kids.\nThree children walking along the road like that would attract quite a lot of attention. Not to mention that the three children were very good-looking.\nFinally, Qiu Tong intercepted the three children by the side of a major road two blocks away.\n“Qiu Xingqiao, you fought with your brother for no reason. Do you still think you did the right thing?”\nQiu Tong crossed her arms and stood before the three of them, looking down at them.\nIt wasn’t easy for her to bring back the male protagonist Ye Luan, so that these three little villains could benefit from his good karma. But they ended up beating him up on the first day!\nQiu Xingqiao’s small face was filled with indignance. He did not like this brother who had appeared out of nowhere, but he did not want to tell Qiu Tong the truth. He could only stare at Qiu Tong with angry eyes.\nQiu Xingyu hid behind her brothers and blinked her eyes at Qiu Tong. Her big eyes were filled with grievance. She wanted to say something but hesitated.\nWhen Qiu Xingyuan heard Qiu Tong’s words, the corners of his lips curled into a cold smile. He raised his head and looked at her coldly, just like when they first met.\nThe three children’s behavior reminded Qiu Tong of their suffering and her heart softened.\n“Alright, come home with me and apologize to brother properly. We’ll have meat to eat tonight!”\nQiu Xingyuan squatted down and reached out to touch Qiu Xingyuan’s head, but he dodged her.\n“You are already going bankrupt just by raising the three of us. Now, you have this Ye Luan. Are you planning to sell us?”\n“Unless you send Ye Luan away, we will never return with you.”\nQiu Tong immediately rebutted Qiu Xingyuan.\n“Don’t worry. I brought Ye Luan back but I won’t let any of you suffer. I won’t sell any of you either.”\n“Ye Luan has nowhere to go. I will never send him away.”\nWhen Qiu Xingyuan heard this, his attitude became even more resolute. The four of them started to argue at the side of the road, and the atmosphere became very tense.\n“Leave. We’re not going back.”\nQiu Tong looked at the three six-year-old brats. They were still underage and had nowhere to go. She suddenly changed her stance and pretended to leave.\n“Since all of you are so determined, I’ll go back first. After you have thought things through, you can go home by yourselves.”\nSeeing that the three children were silent, Qiu Tong decided to just walk off. However, she did not go far and hid at a corner of the street to secretly observe them.\n“Elder Brother, Mommy seems to have really left.” Qiu Xingyu looked in the direction Qiu Tong left and felt a little flustered.\n“Don’t worry, Elder Brother will take good care of you.”\nQiu Xingyuan’s aura became even colder. He brought his younger brother and sister into a provision store. He approached an amiable-looking woman and blinked his big eyes, pretending to be innocent.\n“Auntie, my mother passed away, and I’m homeless now. Can you help me book a room at the hotel? We are very tired. I can pay you too.”\nThe round-faced woman looked at the money Qiu Xingyuan stuffed into her hands and instantly beamed with joy. She brought them to the nearest hotel and booked a room.\nQiu Tong stared in bewilderment at Qiu Xingyuan’s god-like maneuvering.\nShe never expected Qiu Xingyuan to do this.\nHis mother passed away?\nHow dare he say that!\nQiu Tong sneaked over to the room the children were in and pressed against the door.\nWhen she heard their discussion about Ye Luan, she realized that the children were jealous. She felt sad but also a little pleased.\nQiu Tong skillfully unlocked the door and sat on the edge of the bed, explaining to the three children seriously.\n“Ye Luan is just a distant relative who was adopted by our family. Why are you guys jealous?”\nHowever, Qiu Tong had already exhausted the children’s trust in her. Moreover, the boys both believed that she was lying when she said that she went to borrow money from relatives. How could they believe her words?\nQiu Xingqiao even made a call to the front desk.\n“A strange auntie barged into our room. Please send someone over and chase her away.”",

      "content": "Chapter 64: Lost Children\nThe security guard soon arrived at the room and looked at Qiu Tong warily, treating her like a bad person who was trying to kidnap children.\n“I’m the children’s mother,” Qiu Tong said in exasperation.\n“We don’t even know her,” Qiu Xingqiao pointed at Qiu Tong angrily.\nQiu Xingyuan stood at the side and did not refute, tacitly agreeing with his younger brother’s words. Little Yu also hid behind her brothers, not daring to look at Qiu Tong’s expression.\nThe security guard took a step forward. His intention to chase her away was very obvious.\nQiu Tong had no choice but to leave the hotel for now. She would think of a solution when she got home.\nBut the moment she entered the house, she bumped into Ye Luan, who was about to push open the door and leave.\n“Ye Luan, where are you going?”\nQiu Tong asked.\n“I don’t think your sons can accept my existence. I don’t want your family to be disrupted because of me, so I want to leave this place. I don’t want to trouble you anymore.”\nYe Luan lowered his head as his fingers subconsciously fiddled with the tattered corner of his shirt.\nQiu Tong looked at Ye Luan, who seemed to be engulfed by loneliness. Her heart filled with compassion. This child had experienced too much.\nThe two of them had gone through life and death together. How could she let him be homeless now?\nMoreover, she would only feel at ease if she kept the male protagonist by her side.\nQiu Tong hurriedly stood in front of Ye Luan to stop him from leaving.\n“Don’t worry and stay here. The three of them are just a little jealous and throwing tantrums. They’re staying at a hotel now and will be back in a few days.”\n“When the time comes, as the eldest brother, you must protect your younger siblings well.”\nYe Luan still wanted to say something, but Qiu Tong pulled him back into the house.\n“Ke Le, bring your men to the hotel to protect those three brats.”\nQiu Tong shouted loudly out the window. She then took out the stewed meat and prepared a simple stir-fry vegetable dish, before inviting Ye Luan to the table.\nKe Le stared through the window at the fragrant meat stew. He cast a resentful glance at Qiu Tong before resigning himself to his fate. He led the way to the hotel.\nWhen Qiu Tong saw that Ye Luan was only eating the rice in his bowl, a conflicted look flashed across her eyes. She quickly piled some meat into his bowln.\n“Eat more meat. You don’t have to be so polite with me.”\nYe Luan didn’t say anything, but the speed at which he ate slowed down. He ate the food, bite by bite.\nAfter dinner, Qiu Tong laid a new mattress for him in the boys’ room so that he could have an early rest.\nAfter Qiu Tong left, Ye Luan smelled the lingering fragrance and warmth in the air, before closing his eyes in peace.\nAll this made him even more reluctant to leave.\nQiu Tong returned to her room, and the moment she closed her eyes, she saw the image of those three children looking resentful.\nThe children’s attitude today made her realize that she had to change to a bigger house.\nThe boys would definitely not be willing to stay with Ye Luan. In addition, Ye Luan had strong self-esteem and would not bow down to others.\nTherefore, the current situation could only be resolved by living in separate rooms.\nThe next morning, the first thing Qiu Tong did when she opened her eyes was to calculate the money she had and contact a housing agent to look around.\nShe went to view nearly every suitable house in the surrounding area, temporarily setting aside the task of picking up the three kids from the hotel.\n“Eldest Brother, does Mommy really not want us anymore?”\nQiu Xingyu held her doll, slumped in front of the window, hoping to see Qiu Tong’s familiar figure. She was not even interested in her favorite candy.\nThe moment he said that, the aura around Qiu Xingyuan became even colder.\nQiu Xingqiao stubbornly pushed all the blame onto Ye Luan. He rolled his eyes and said, “It’s all Ye Luan’s fault. If he hadn’t suddenly appeared, would we have to stay in a hotel?”\n“Ye Luan must have a family. He can’t have appeared out of nowhere, right? As long as we can get rid of Ye Luan, our lives will be the same as before.”\nQiu Xingyuan nodded in agreement. The three of them left the hotel and sneaked to the vicinity of the house.\nThe three of them waited outside for more than an hour before Qiu Tong finally left.\nQiu Xingyuan let his younger siblings stay at the door as lookouts while he ran to a nearby provision store and called the police.\n“Uncle Policeman, a homeless child suddenly appeared at my house. Please help him find his family.”\nAfter Qiu Xingyuan gave the address, he quickly hung up the phone and returned to his younger siblings’ side.\nThe police were surprised to receive such a call from a child. Nevertheless, they still gathered their men and drove the police car towards Qiu Tong’s house.",

      "content": "Chapter 65: Conflict\nQiu Tong had already arranged to meet the real estate agent to view houses, but halfway there, she received a call from the agent.\nThe agent told her apologetically that the owner of the house had something on and would only be back later.\nQiu Tong had no choice but to reschedule her appointment with the agent before heading home.\nHer original intention was to make use of this rare free time to bring Ye Luan to buy some new clothes and supplies, before visiting the three children.\nShe did not expect to see a police car approaching her house.\n“What are you doing outside my house?”\nQiu Tong said loudly when she saw the police confronting Ye Luan.\n“We received a report saying that there was a homeless child here. The household registration office also said that the child’s registered residence is not here.”\n“According to the rules, we have to bring the child back to the police station. We have to contact the child’s family or send the child to the local welfare center. Either way, we can’t let him stay at your house.”\nThe policeman sized Qiu Tong up from head to toe, as if he was looking at a criminal who did human trafficking.\nQiu Tong objected. She glanced at Ye Luan, who was on his guard, and stood in front of the police.\n“I don’t know who called the police, but you can’t take this child away from me.”\nThe policeman looked at Qiu Tong suspiciously and pointed at Ye Luan.\n“Since you put it that way, I’d like to ask you, where did this child come from?”\n“Do I have any reason to suspect that you’re carrying out human trafficking? Now, you have to come with me too.”\nQiu Tong’s eyes darkened. She had to go with the police.\nShe stroked Ye Luan’s hair comfortingly and got into the police car with the police.\nThe children witnessed this scene clearly from the shadows.\nQiu Xingyu looked at her brothers anxiously.\n“Elder Brother, aren’t they here to take Ye Luan away? Why did they bring Mommy along?”\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao looked at each other in dismay. It was clear that they had not expected things to turn out this way either.\n“Elder Brother, quickly think of something. Mommy is already in the car. Do you really want Mommy to be arrested by the police?”\nQiu Xingyu looked at Qiu Tong’s slender back, her heart in complete turmoil as she looked at her brother with teary eyes.\n“Since she chose to protect Ye Luan, let her go to the police station. If we don’t let that woman suffer a little, she won’t think of us.”\nQiu Xingyuan’s tone was cold and unyielding as he looked at the police car gradually disappearing into the distance. However, his eyes were filled with conflict and darkness.\n“Elder Brother is right. We shouldn’t care about her.”\nQiu Xingqiao was stubborn and pushed his sister back. “Let’s go back to the hotel. That woman doesn’t want us anymore. I don’t care if she goes to the police station.”\nAlthough Qiu Xingqiao said this, he still turned to look at the police car. He only turned back after the police car had completely disappeared.\nMeanwhile, Qiu Tong and Ye Luan were separated after they were brought to the police station.\nThe police brought Ye Luan to the reception room but brought Qiu Tong to the interrogation room.\n“I’ve already said this many times. Ye Luan didn’t appear out of thin air, nor is his origin unknown.”\n“He was officially adopted by me. However, the procedures have not been completed yet, so his household register has not been amended.”\nQiu Tong didn’t know how many times she had explained herself, but the police didn’t believe her.\nAt this moment, the door of the interrogation room was pushed open by a middle-aged man.\nThe police officer stood up and whispered into the middle-aged man’s ear, “Chief, this woman is suspected of human trafficking, but she’s very tight-lipped and won’t say anything.”\nChief Officer Fang picked up the documents on the table and flipped through a couple pages before throwing them in front of Qiu Tong.\n“You said you adopted him. What about the adoption certificate?”\nQiu Tong rolled her eyes, her temper rising.\n“I’ve already said that the adoption paperwork has not been completed yet…”\n“Nonsense. According to the rules, you’re not allowed to bring the child home before the paperwork is completed.”\nChief Officer Fang interrupted her.\n“I think you abducted the child and brought him here to sell. You still dare to deny it when there’s concrete evidence.”\n“Bring her to the detention center. Get ready to hand her over to the prosecutor immediately.”\nQiu Tong was obviously unwilling to comply. She looked coldly at the self-opinionated police chief and pushed away the police officers who were about to take her away forcefully. She stared at them with bloodshot eyes and said, “I’ll say it again, I didn’t kidnap the child!”\n“How dare you attack the police!” Chief Officer Fang was furious. He slammed the table and stood up.\n“Hurry up and capture her!”\n“Come at me if you dare!”\nAt this critical moment, a deep and dignified male voice sounded from the door.\nChief Officer Fang turned around and was about to scold this person who dared to challenge his authority. However, when he saw the rank of a second lieutenant on the other party’s shoulder, he swallowed his words.\nIt was Shao An.",

He quickly walked over and smiled.\n“Second Lieutenant Sir, why have you come to our small police station?”\nShao An looked down at Chief Officer Fang. He tossed a brown leather folder at him. His voice was cold.\n“I came to deliver Ye Luan’s adoption papers to Qiu Tong, but I didn’t expect her to be arrested and sent to the police station.”\n“You can arrest someone based on your own assumptions without any concrete evidence. Is this how your police department works?”\nChief Officer Fang’s forehead was instantly covered in cold sweat. He hadn’t expected that Qiu Tong would really be able to adopt a child. Even more so, he never expected this ordinary woman to have connections with the military.\nTo be able to mobilize a second lieutenant to protect her, the power behind this woman was something he didn’t even dare to think about.\nChief Officer Fang hurriedly apologized to Qiu Tong and personally placed the adoption papers back into the leather folder before respectfully handing it over to her.\n“Miss Qiu Tong, I’m really sorry. We were just too eager to solve the case. Please forgive us and don’t take it to heart.”\nQiu Tong snorted. She knew that although the chief officer was a little stubborn and conceited, there were indeed some issues with her adoption process. She could not entirely blame these people.\n“Chief Officer Fang, I hope this misunderstanding will never happen again.”\nChief Officer Fang felt relieved after hearing that. He quickly got someone to bring Ye Luan over and sent the three of them out of the door together with the other police officers.\nJust as Shao An entered the police station, the three children had also arrived.\nThe three children regretted their actions the moment they returned to the hotel. In the end, they decided to come to the police station to rescue Qiu Tong.\nAfter all, they hated Ye Luan, not Qiu Tong.\nQiu Xingqiao squatted at the side and whispered.\n“Elder Brother, I just surveyed the area. There are four cameras in front of the police station, and two cameras in the neighboring district where the entrance of the police station is captured.”\nQiu Xingyuan nodded and calmly made arrangements.\n“Little Yu, hack into the system and cut off all the power from the six surveillance cameras and the police station. When that happens, the police station will definitely be in chaos. Xingqiao and I can then take the opportunity to go in and save them.”\n“When the time comes…”\nQiu Xingyuan’s voice suddenly trailed off, and his sharp gaze stared fixedly at the police station’s entrance.\nThe other two children followed their elder brother’s gaze and saw Qiu Tong carrying Ye Luan and walking out with Shao An.\n“Shao An, thanks.” Qiu Tong waved the adoption agreement in her hand with a smile.\n“Boss asked me to do it.” Shao An waved and left.\n“Ye Luan, are you happy? From now on, you will be able to live together with us.” Qiu Tong placed Ye Luan on the ground and squatted down with a smile.\n“Don’t worry. What happened today will never happen again. I will protect you and your siblings from now on. I will not let any harm come to you.”\nYe Luan’s heart skipped a beat as he looked at Qiu Tong’s serious expression. After experiencing so much together, this was the first time he had developed trust in someone.\nQiu Xingyuan watched as Qiu Tong tidied Ye Luan’s clothes and behaved affectionately with him. The storm in his eyes was nearly visible as he turned to leave.\nQiu Xingqiao snorted, the jealousy and anger in his heart reaching its peak.\nThis woman was very powerful. There was no need for them to save her!\nHe kicked the can aside and left quickly.\nQiu Tong turned around but did not see anyone.\nYe Luan also looked back. He caught a passing glimpse of the corner of a pink skirt. His eyes flashed with understanding and he seemed to be deep in thought.\nHe crossed his arms over his chest, and his expression was that of a person many years older.\n“Auntie Qiu, you’re such a terrible mother. None of the three children want to go home.”\nQiu Tong was smiling on the inside at his adult-like manner, but pretended to look troubled. She let out a long sigh and shrugged.\n“I have already tried my best to persuade them. Those three children just won’t come home with me. What choice do I have?”\nYe Luan looked at her with disdain. She couldn’t even handle three little brats. He was a bit speechless.\n“Don’t worry, I’ll definitely have those three kids return home.”\nAs he said this, an awkward expression flashed across his face. “Don’t think too much. I just want to return the favor.”\nQiu Tong burst into laughter and ruffled his hair.\n“Alright, Aunt Qiu will depend on you then.”",

She did not expect that they would not even go to school.\nShe was silent for a moment, and decided to cover for the three kids.\n“Teacher, I’m really sorry. Something cropped up at home, so I didn’t have time to apply for leave for the three of them. But don’t worry, after the family matters are settled, the three of them will continue to go to school.”\n“Xingyuan’s mother, I’m relieved then. If there are such things in the future, you must inform us promptly. Otherwise, we would be very worried.”\nThe kindergarten teacher could not help but lecture her.\nQiu Tong apologized again and hung up the phone. She was all prepared to go to the hotel to grab the three children and send them to kindergarten.\n“Are you going to look for the three of them?”\nYe Luan put down his bowl of rice, a hint of craftiness in his eyes. “I’ll go with you, I have a plan.”\nQiu Tong knew that Ye Luan was the ultimate cause of the triplets’ unwillingness to return home. If she brought him along, there might be a pleasant surprise.\nShe nodded and agreed.\n“Elder Brother, look! Isn’t that Mommy?”\nQiu Xingyu was leaning on the window sill. When she saw the familiar figure, her eyes lit up and she pointed downstairs excitedly.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao hurriedly came to the window. When they saw Qiu Tong, a hint of joy flashed across their eyes. However, when they saw Ye Luan beside her, all the joy in their eyes disappeared, leaving only anger.\nQiu Tong brought Ye Luan to the door of the three children’s room. Just as she was about to knock, she realized that the door wasn’t tightly shut.\nShe reached out and pushed open the door. Years of battle experience had made her aware of impending danger.\nQiu Tong quickly pushed Ye Luan away and somersaulted in the air, dodging the bucket that fell from the sky.\nJust as she heaved a sigh of relief, a huge black trash bag came towards her. She couldn’t help cursing.\nWith one hand on the ground, Qiu Tong rolled to the right. She was worried the trash bag was dirty and didn’t want to kick it.\nHowever, the traps set by the three children were far from over.\nQiu Tong faced a barrage of pillows, towels and even slippery shower gel spread all over the floor. She had to use all her wits and abilities just to avoid them.\nShe felt that this was more tiring than a real fight.\nIf not for her quick reflexes, she might have been fooled by the three children.\nQiu Tong dodged the last “weapon” and stood in front of the three children, sighing.\nForget it, it would be worth it if this allowed them to vent their anger.\n“I received a call from the kindergarten teacher. She said that you guys haven’t been to school the past few days. Are you guys going to boycott classes?”\nQiu Xingyuan was still in a fit of anger as he said in a dark tone, “Why? Isn’t Ye Luan enough for you to manage? You still have the mood to worry about us?”\n“Elder Brother is right. Just take good care of him. Why do you care about us?” Qiu Xingqiao shouted loudly.\n“We’re not going to kindergarten. You can use the money you saved to support Ye Luan.”\nQiu Tong’s head ached. She didn’t know why they were so hostile towards Ye Luan.\nWas this the power of heaven’s will?\nThe villains and protagonists were destined to be unable to coexist peacefully?\n“You’re right.”\nA tender voice sounded from behind them.\nThe four of them turned around and saw Ye Luan stepping into the room, carefully avoiding the stuff on the ground.\n“This is perfect. I am old enough to go to elementary school now. If you guys don’t go to school, Aunt Qiu can use this money to pay my school fees instead.”\nYe Luan’s expression was cold. But he secretly winked at Qiu Tong.\nQiu Tong instantly understood Ye Luan’s intentions and nodded in agreement.\n“You have a point. I’ll have you enrolled immediately.”\nAs Qiu Tong spoke, she held Ye Luan’s hand and walked out without looking back.\nQiu Xingqiao looked at the backs of the two of them and felt like he was about to explode on the spot.\n“I told you that the kid was up to no good!”\n“Elder Brother, are you going to just watch him spend that woman’s money?”\nQiu Xingyuan’s face was also filled with grievance. He pursed his lips and snorted coldly.\n“I won’t let Ye Luan do as he pleases. I want him to know that we have the right to spend that woman’s money.”\n“Let’s go to kindergarten now.”\nQiu Tong hid outside the door and listened to the children’s conversation. She gave Ye Luan a thumbs-up and brought him to the elementary school next door to the kindergarten to settle the admission procedures.\nHowever, Qiu Tong did not expect that something would happen to the three children the moment they returned to class.",

      "content": "Chapter 68: Softening\nAfter receiving the call, Qiu Tong hurried to the kindergarten next door, where the teacher was already waiting.\n“Teacher, what happened?”\nQiu Tong asked anxiously.\n“It’s like this. During class, Qiu Xingyuan had prepared some bottles and test tubes, saying that he was doing research on some locust pesticide.”\n“But while some of the other kids were playing, one of them knocked over his test tubes, and they got into a fight.”\n“After I found out, I immediately brought the children to the office. I also asked the parent of that kid to come. They are already waiting in the office.”\nThe teacher told Qiu Tong everything that had happened as they walked to the office.\nWhen Qiu Xingyuan followed the teacher into the office, the parent of the other child was loudly scolding Qiu Xingyuan.\n“How did the kindergarten accept a child with violent tendencies like you? I really don’t know how your family taught you.”\n“I am his mother. You can talk to me if you want.”\nQiu Tong frowned and stood in front of Qiu Xingyuan, blocking the other party’s fierce gaze.\nThe parent sized Qiu Tong up. Seeing that she wasn’t wearing any branded clothes, the parent became even more arrogant.\n“Let me tell you, I have never hit my precious baby myself.”\n“But now, my baby was injured by your kid at the kindergarten. Not only was he physically hurt, he was also emotionally affected.”\n“Not only do you have to compensate us for his medical expenses, but you also have to compensate for his psychological damage.”\n“Otherwise, I’ll bring my child to the hospital for an examination and tell everyone that your child has violent tendencies. Let’s see if any kindergarten will dare to accept him!”\nQiu Xingyuan stood behind Qiu Tong, tightly clenching his fists, his eyes cold.\nHe had stirred up so much trouble for Qiu Tong this time. She would definitely not let him off. She would scold him or even give him a good bashing.\nHe would not be let off the hook, no matter what.\nJust as the expression in Qiu Xingyuan’s eyes dimmed, Qiu Tong’s next words made him suddenly raise his head.\nQiu Tong looked at the other party’s twisted face and snorted.\n“Sure enough, children do take after their parents. Looking at you, I can imagine how unreasonable your child usually is.”\n“My son has always been respectful and polite. He is very well-mannered. If not for your son knocking over all of his test tubes and wasting all his hard work, my son would not have done this.”\n“Furthermore, these test tubes and the materials used to make the medicine were carefully selected by my son and bought with money. They did not come out of nowhere.”\n“So, not only will I not pay any medical fees, you will also have to compensate us for damage to our property.”\nThe other kid’s parent widened her eyes in disbelief.\n“You must be so poor that you have gone crazy. It’s just a child’s toy. How can it be worth so much money?”\n“He’s just a six-year-old kid. You don’t really believe that he can develop drugs that can be put on the market, do you?”\n“I think you’re just bluffing.”\nQiu Tong snorted, her eyes full of mockery. “That’s because you are too stupid to see.”\n“Although my son is only six years old, he is already very talented in chemistry. Even a high school student might not have such deep chemistry knowledge.”\n“If you don’t believe me, I can take the residual chemicals to the laboratory. The facts will speak for themselves.”\n“Also, you said that my son pushed your child and injured him.”\n“I’ll call the police now. If your child doesn’t have any injuries, I’ll sue you for defamation and fraud. Let’s see which kindergarten would dare to accept the son of a fraud!”\nQiu Tong crossed her arms over her chest and looked at the ashen-faced parent before her without any mercy.\n“According to the law…”\nQiu Xingyuan stood behind Qiu Tong, his eyes filled with light as he looked at her back view with a burning gaze. Qiu Tong’s stern voice sounded like heavenly music to his ears.\nIt turned out that she understood how hard he worked. She valued his experiments and hard work.\nQiu Xingyuan’s vision blurred.\nThe other kid’s parent clearly did not expect the seemingly delicate and weak-looking Qiu Tong to be such a tough nut to crack.\n“Just take it that we’re unlucky. We won’t argue with you anymore.”\nNot knowing what else to say, the other party’s parent pulled her child along and wanted to leave.\n“Wait, you haven’t apologized to my son yet.”\nQiu Tong pushed Qiu Xingyuan towards them and said firmly.\nThe other kid’s parent had no choice. With a dark expression, she pressed down her own son’s head in apology to Qiu Xingyuan. She then threw down some money and left angrily.\nQiu Tong placed the money in Qiu Xingyuan’s hands and said in a gentle voice, “Qiu Xingyuan, this is their compensation for you. You decide what to do with it.”\nQiu Xingyuan hurriedly averted his eyes to prevent her from seeing the emotional turmoil in his eyes. He said stubbornly.\n“Don’t think that I’ll go home just because you helped me. Give up on that thought.”",

Her mood improved greatly.\nThat stubborn brat.\nAfter Qiu Tong settled the children, it was time for her to view the house.\n“Miss Qiu, not only is this house located in a good location, but it’s also spacious and private. It’s the safest place for a mother like you who has children.”\nThe agent introduced the surroundings to Qiu Tong as he knocked on the door.\nThe owner of the house was a middle-aged man. He politely invited them in.\nThe house was a small two-story villa. There were five rooms upstairs, two rooms downstairs, an open kitchen and living room, as well as a small storage room.\nThere was an attached garden outside the house, and below it was a basement that had been transformed by the original owner into a movie theater.\nMoreover, judging from the layout and environment of the house, the owner of the house was also someone who cherished the house and enjoyed life.\nThis was the most satisfying house Qiu Tong had seen in recent times.\nNot only could each child have their own room, they could also transform the extra room into their work room.\n“To be honest, if it weren’t for the fact that our whole family is going abroad, I wouldn’t have been willing to sell this house.” The middle-aged man chuckled when he saw Qiu Tong’s moved expression.\n“It’s indeed very good. I can confirm my interest now.”\nQiu Tong nodded with satisfaction.\nThe agent’s face lit up. Another generous commission in his pocket now.\nHowever, just as he was about to bring Qiu Tong over to make payment, a harsh female voice came from behind.\n“I’m very pleased with this house. I want it.”\nA woman with heavy makeup and wearing slim heels appeared in front of everyone.\n“Miss Lu, Miss Qiu has decided on this house. Why don’t I show you another house?”\nThe agent’s expression changed when he saw the woman. He spoke respectfully.\nHe had arranged with Miss Lu to view houses tomorrow. He did not expect her to come looking for him today.\n“I want this house.”\nMiss Lu raised her chin and looked at Qiu Tong with disdain. She said arrogantly, “Why? Do you think I can’t afford it?”\nThe agent’s eyes were filled with panic as he looked at Qiu Tong with a troubled expression.\n“Miss Qiu, do you want to look at other houses?”\nQiu Tong did not want to give up the house that she had worked so hard to find.\n“First come first serve. I want this house.”\nMiss Lu snorted and stretched out her five fingers, her long nails nearly poking into Qiu Tong’s eyes.\n“When buying something, the highest bidder wins.”\n“Owner, if you sell the house to me, I’ll add $10,000 to the total amount.”\nWhen the owner heard that, he was tempted. He turned to Qiu Tong and waited for her reply.\nQiu Tong sneered and stepped forward.\n“I’ll add $20,000!”\nMiss Lu’s expression changed. Qiu Tong didn’t look rich but she was so extravagant. She did not even blink when she called out $20,000. Miss Lu’s face darkened.\n“$30,000.”\nQiu Tong did not give in at all, and her aura grew even stronger.\n“$40,000!”\nMiss Lu did not say anything else. Although she could still bid, there was no need for her to spend so much money on this house.\nAfter all, $40,000 was not a small sum.\nBesides, she did not know Qiu Tong’s limit.\n“I’ll remember you.”\nMiss Lu threw down these words coldly and turned to leave. Her high heels made a sharp tapping sound on the ground, showing her anger.\nA radiant smile appeared on Qiu Tong’s face when she paid the deposit and got the signed contract.\nHowever, the agent did not look that happy. He kept sighing and looked at Qiu Tong worriedly.\n“Miss Qiu, Miss Lu’s full name is Lu Zhiling. She’s a doctor from a nearby clinic.”\n“She has a close relationship with Mayor Shen. You have offended her, so you must be careful in the future.”\nWhen Qiu Tong heard the word “doctor”, she quickly recalled the incident in the clinic. Her sharp senses told her that Lu Zhiling was involved.\n“Thank you for the advice, but I am not someone who is afraid of trouble.”\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes. If this woman dared to do anything, she would settle all scores with her.\nIt was getting dark when Qiu Tong came out of the house.. She looked down at the time and hurried towards the school.",

She walked over with steady steps, feeling a little out of place with the mischievous and lively children around her.\nThe three children also saw Qiu Tong at the door. They were just about to go over when they saw Ye Luan and stopped in their tracks.\n“Auntie Qiu.” Ye Luan nodded at Qiu Tong and followed her towards the three children.\n“Qiu Xingyuan, I’m going to prepare a feast tonight. Can you bring your younger siblings home for dinner?”\nQiu Tong squatted in front of Qiu Xingyuan with a smile.\nQiu Xingqiao and Qiu Xingyu turned to look at their eldest brother, waiting for his answer.\nThey knew about Qiu Tong defending Qiu Xingyuan in the office today, so their resentment towards her was not as great as before.\nQiu Xingyuan’s cold gaze swept across Ye Luan and Qiu Tong. He did not answer Qiu Tong’s question. Instead, he pulled his younger siblings and circled around the two of them in an irritated manner.\n“Qiu Xingyu, the meatballs at the hotel last night. You seemed to enjoy them. Do you want to eat them again tonight?”\nQiu Xingyuan glanced at Qiu Tong before speaking to his sister.\nQiu Xingyu instantly understood what her brother meant. Although she was a little hesitant, she still clapped her hands in feigned joy.\n“Sure, sure. That meatball is so delicious. I want to eat sweet and sour beef too.”\nQiu Xingqiao also chimed in.\n“I heard that our hotel had to pay a large sum of money to hire this chef. The food he makes is definitely much better than a certain someone.”\n“We can eat different dishes every day and try all the dishes on the menu.”\nQiu Tong understood the meaning behind their words. After exchanging glances with Ye Luan, she raised her voice and said.\n“Ye Luan, I saw a very good house this afternoon. I’ve already made a down payment and can move in anytime.”\n“We can move in tonight. And I’ve prepared a feast to celebrate. There’s a movie theater in the basement and the two of us can watch movies and snack tonight.”\n“What movie do you like? We’ll watch it.”\nYe Luan played along with Qiu Tong. “I want to eat popcorn and iced watermelon. It would be even better if there’s cake.”\nThe three children stopped in their tracks when they heard their conversation.\nThis woman actually bought a new house?\nThey looked at each other and saw the emotions in each other’s eyes.\nThey could not let Ye Luan take advantage of the new house!\nQiu Tong bought that house. If Ye Luan could stay there, they could as well.\nThe three children quietly changed their direction.\nQiu Tong saw that although their faces looked grim, they still obediently followed behind her and Ye Luan. She couldn’t help but chuckle on the inside.\nEven though this method was a little cliche, it was useful.\nBefore long, the four children stood in front of the two-story villa and looked at the building in front of them in shock. They could not believe that this was their future home.\n“This house is very spacious. Each of you can choose your own room and have your own space.”\n“I’ll leave the choice to you.”\nQiu Tong clapped her hands and looked at the surprised children. She felt that her money spent had been worth it.\n“I want to stay in this room.”\nIt was rare for Ye Luan to take the initiative and choose the room first.\nHow could Qiu Xingqiao let Ye Luan beat him to it? He purposely said, “I want this one too. I like the blue wallpaper inside.”\nYe Luan generously gave it to him. “Alright, then you can stay in this room. I think the one next to this room is not bad either.”\nHowever, Qiu Xingqiao insisted on going against him and provoked, “I also think this one is not bad! I want this one then!”\n“You can choose first. I’ll choose after you’re done.”\nYe Luan understood his intentions and gave a discreet smile. He put on a magnanimous face and looked at Qiu Tong obediently.\nQiu Tong patted his head gently and smiled brightly. “Ye Luan, you’re so obedient. Whatever you want to eat tonight, Auntie Qiu will make it for you.”\nYe Luan nodded. “Auntie Qiu is so nice. I will definitely be obedient and not make you angry.”\n“After all, you’ve worked hard to support me.”\nQiu Tong and Ye Luan performed in perfect harmony. The three children looked very conflicted at their blissful expressions.\nMeanwhile, Lu Zhiling had just returned home. The more she thought about the earlier incident, the angrier she became. She found her younger brother Lu Sheng and planned with him to teach Qiu Tong a lesson.\nWhen Lu Sheng heard that his sister had been bullied, his fiery temper was instantly ignited. He immediately brought a few hooligans along to find Qiu Tong.. The gang surrounded Qiu Tong and the children.",

A widow with a bunch of children dares to bully my sister? Fighting over a house with my sister, I think you’re tired of living!”\n“I’m warning you, give up the house immediately. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being ruthless!”\nQiu Tong recognized that this was the gangster who had been causing trouble at the clinic. She narrowed her eyes and said coldly.\n“I’m open and aboveboard. Why should I give up a house that I bought with real money?”\n“You want to snatch my house? Come and get it yourself!”\nLu Sheng had always been domineering. Not only did he not show any fear, he became even more arrogant.\n“Seems like you want to do things the hard way.”\n“Guys, attack! Don’t show mercy just because she’s a woman!”\nWith a flash, Qiu Tong snatched the wooden club from the hands of the burly man closest to her. She flew up and kicked him hard in the stomach!\n“Ah!”\nThe burly man felt his arm go numb as a huge force surged towards him. It was as though his internal organs had shifted positions as he was sent flying backwards, smashing heavily into the ground!\nQiu Tong brandished the club in her hand fiercely. One punch and one club strike for each of them. All of them would soon fall to the ground screaming and moaning.\nShe grabbed Lu Sheng’s hair and smashed his face against the ground.\n“You’re in luck today because I can’t be too violent in front of the children. Otherwise, I won’t let you off so easily.”\n“I’m just teaching you a lesson today. If you dare to try again, I’ll send you to meet your maker.”\nLu Sheng’s face was covered in tears, snot and blood. He was in a miserable state and could only concede defeat to save his life.\nQiu Tong let go of Lu Sheng’s hair and turned to smile at the children.\nShe waved at them and walked past them with victory in her step. Her dashing back profile was deeply imprinted in their hearts.\nNot only did Lu Sheng fail to gain anything from Qiu Tong, he almost lost his life. How could he let this go?\nHe immediately went home to discuss a plan with Lu Zhiling.\nWhen Lu Zhiling heard her brother’s words, she clenched her fists tightly, her long nails leaving deep marks on her palms.\n“Why don’t you find more people? I don’t believe that a woman like her can be that good.”\n“Sis, this woman is very evil. I think we should attack from another angle.”\nAs soon as Lu Sheng said this, Lu Zhiling knew that he already had a plan in mind and waited for him to continue.\n“After I came back, I asked someone to investigate Qiu Tong and found that her family background is quite shady. We can make use of her bad reputation to prevent her from living there.”\nLu Zhiling immediately became excited and discussed with Lu Sheng in a low voice how to deal with Qiu Tong…\nThe next day, as soon as Qiu Tong walked out of the door, she realized that there were already many people gathered at the door, pointing at her house.\nShe looked at what everyone was pointing at and saw that her front door was covered in red paint.\n“The daughter of a swindler is also a swindler!”\n“Pay back what you owe.”\n“Swindler, get out!”\nSeeing these words, everyone immediately looked at Qiu Tong with hostility.\nAlthough the residents here weren’t extremely wealthy, they still owned considerable assets to be able to afford a house in this district. They were especially sensitive to swindlers.\nQiu Tong was the daughter of the swindler, Qiu Rong. As soon as the news spread, there was much discussion about Qiu Tong and her children.\n“How can we be at ease with such a person living here?”\n“This kind of swindler can easily fall back into old ways. She might target us one day.”\nA middle-aged man who had once suffered from fraud shouted at Qiu Tong, “People like you should go back to the slums. We don’t welcome you here!”\nThe moment the man said that, the crowd started to stir. They all agreed with the man and glared at Qiu Tong and the children.\nAs the saying goes, enemies always crossed paths.\nAfter leaving Mr. Cui, Lin Shan did not settle down on her own. A person like her always had to depend on a man.\nWith her beauty and figure, she soon found herself a new man who lived in the same neighborhood as Qiu Tong. The moment they stepped out, they saw Qiu Tong getting scolded.\nLin Shan stood behind the crowd and looked at Qiu Tong, who was being pointed at by the crowd. The jealousy and resentment in her heart reached a peak.\nQiu Tong was clearly so rich that she could purchase property here, yet she had taken $15,000 from her. Why?!\nWhen Lin Shan saw that Qiu Tong was being harangued by the crowd, she sneered and joined in.\n“Qiu Tong, you have the money to buy a villa here and live a good life. Yet, you didn’t help your father compensate those poor people who were scammed.. What a filial daughter you are.”",

Whenever you asked for something, he would buy it immediately and give it to you.”\n“Uncle Qiu didn’t say a word even though you stubbornly bore three children with some unknown guy. He has always been quietly supporting you.”\n“Now, you’re enjoying your life here with a huge sum of money that you got through some shady means, while Uncle Qiu is suffering in prison. Can you really feel at ease?”\nQiu Tong looked at Lin Shan coldly and sneered.\n“In this world, you are the least worthy person to criticize me! My former best friend, who tried to fleece me even after my family went bankrupt.”\nQiu Tong turned to look at the man standing intimately beside Lin Shan and smiled brightly.\n“Lin Shan, you put so much emphasis on relationships. But didn’t you break up with Mr. Cui to find a new boyfriend?”\nWhen the man beside Lin Shan heard this, he immediately shook off her hand and turned to question her.\n“Lin Shan, didn’t you say that I was your first man?”\n“The first?”\nQiu Tong looked at Lin Shan with feigned surprise. “Didn’t you break up with Mr. Cui because he saw a picture of you with another man?”\n“That’s not right. I remember that it wasn’t just one man.”\nThe man’s face darkened visibly, and his gaze towards Lin Shan was filled with coldness.\nLin Shan had been dating the man for a long time. She knew that the man was really angry, so she quickly held his arm and explained.\n“Honey, listen to me. It’s not like that…”\nTo her surprise, the man shook off her hand and walked in the other direction without looking back.\n“Qiu Tong, how could you be so vicious as to come up with such a lie to sow discord between me and my boyfriend!”\nLin Shan turned to glare at Qiu Tong, her eyes filled with jealousy and hatred. She couldn’t help but think of Qiu Tong in the most vicious way possible.\nIt was impossible for Qiu Tong to suddenly have so much money and live here just based on her own abilities. Otherwise, she would not have been in such dire straits when the Qiu family went bankrupt.\nTherefore, she must have found a rich man who was willing to spend money on her. So that she was able to live in such a big house now.\nShe voiced out her conjecture.\nQiu Tong crossed her arms and stood on the steps, looking at her coldly. “You depend on men to survive, so you think others are like you.”\n“I’m not you. I don’t have to rely on a rich man. I can become rich with my own abilities.”\nLin Shan didn’t expect Qiu Tong to be so powerful even after the Qiu family had fallen.\n“Qiu Tong, I want to see how long that man can tolerate you and your three brats!”\n“I’m waiting to see the day you get kicked out of the house!”\nQiu Tong held the house deed in her hand confidently. Her lips curled up slightly, but her smile did not reach her eyes. “Lin Shan, you still have time to argue with me here?”\n“If you don’t chase after your boyfriend now, I’m afraid that he will chase you out of the house.”\nLin Shan suddenly remembered how temperamental the man could be and panicked. She glared at Qiu Tong and rushed out of the crowd, chasing after the man.\nMeanwhile, Lu Zhiling had been hiding in the crowd to see Qiu Tong make a fool of herself. She wanted to see Qiu Tong being criticized by everyone and she overheard Lin Shan and Qiu Tong’s conversation.\nShe gritted her teeth, feeling indignant.\nWhy was Qiu Tong’s sugar daddy so generous that he was willing to give her so much money in such a short time?\nAs for her own sugar daddy, not only was he a little eccentric, he was also not so generous when it came to money. Thinking of this, she hated Qiu Tong even more.\nLu Zhiling didn’t want to look at Qiu Tong’s victorious face anymore. She turned around and left the district.\nHowever, the residents’ condemnation of Qiu Tong did not stop.\n“Actually… Qiu Rong might not be a fraud. I heard that he did a lot of charity work and sponsored many people.”\nAmidst the scolding, a middle-aged woman suddenly called out in a small voice.\nHowever, her voice was quickly drowned out by the intense emotions of the crowd.\nQiu Tong frowned when she heard the woman’s words.\nFrom what she said, Qiu Rong was not a bad person?\nThen why did he cheat…\nQiu Tong didn’t have much of an impression of Qiu Rong and didn’t know much about him. So even though she found it rather strange, she didn’t think too much about it.",

By then, you won’t be able to escape the crime of slandering me and causing trouble.”\n“If you guys want to stay in a jail for a few days, I don’t mind helping you fulfil that wish.”\nQiu Tong’s attitude was firm, and when the crowd heard her mention the law, they lost their confidence and started to disperse.\nA few remaining stubborn folks were then cleared away after Qiu Tong called for security.\nQiu Tong had thought that this matter would end here, but the next day, her photos and history were exposed on the internet.\nLin Shan stirred up a major furore in the online forums with comments about how a swindler’s daughter was living in a luxurious mansion.\nThe matter continued to brew and rumors started to spread online.\nJin Yang’s expression darkened when he saw Qiu Tong’s photo on the headlines. His slender fingers scrolled down the screen. The malicious comments made the storm in his eyes deepen.\n“Shao An, when did the internet become so chaotic? Clean up the online environment immediately.”\n“I want everyone to know that the Internet is not a lawless place.”\nShao An, “…”\nWas this really something they should bother about?\nWhen Sir came across anything that had to do with Qiu Tong, he would always lose his mind.\nMeanwhile, rumors about Qiu Tong had spread everywhere on the Internet. She saw the distorted facts and malicious comments.\nQiu Tong stared at the computer with cold eyes.\nThese people hid behind their computers and did not know the truth. They only followed random rumors on the Internet.\nThey were baring their fangs and brandishing their claws behind the keyboard. These netizens were even more despicable than those people who had pointed at her in real life!\nShe would let these keyboard warriors know that cyber crime was also a crime!\nQiu Tong placed her slender fingers on the keyboard. Just as she was about to show off her skills, she suddenly realized that within minutes, all the trending searches about her had disappeared without a trace. The accounts of those netizens who had been criticizing her had also been blocked.\nThe entire online world was quiet. There was no sign of the chaos from before.\nQiu Tong could not help but exclaim with heartfelt emotion.\nThe efficiency of the cyber-police in this alternate world was really very high. Such a fast response and concise action was something that even her original world could not achieve.\nShe closed her laptop with a smile, shaking her head gently.\nJust as Qiu Tong was about to pack up and leave the house, she received an unexpected call.\n“Hello, is this Miss Qiu? I am calling from the prison. There has been a sudden outbreak of an infectious disease here which has infected many prisoners, and your father Qiu Rong was not spared.”\n“The prisoner is weak. I don’t know if he can make it through. He keeps talking about you. Do you want to meet him?”\nQiu Tong was stunned.\nThe former owner of her body hadn’t visited Qiu Rong for many years. After she transmigrated, things happened so quickly one after another. The children took up most of her time and she never even thought of the father.\nShe kept silent. The book she read did not provide much information about Qiu Rong and Qiu Tong’s relationship. She was a little afraid of exposing herself in front of this man who was very familiar with Qiu Tong.\nQiu Tong gave it some serious thought and finally found an excuse to reject the visit.\nAfter hanging up the phone, she realized that the three children were peering through the door with gloomy expressions. It was obvious that they were unhappy.\nWhen they saw Qiu Tong looking at them, they grew even more withdrawn. Qiu Xingyuan snorted coldly and ran away with his siblings. He slammed the bedroom door shut. No matter how Qiu Tong knocked on the door, the kids inside did not respond.\nAn ordinary bedroom door was no obstacle to Qiu Tong. She poked a wire into the keyhole, and with two clicks, the door opened.\nThe three children were gathered together. When they saw her, their expressions changed abruptly. Qiu Xingyuan immediately placed his hands behind his back as if he was hiding something.\n“Qiu Xingyuan, what are you hiding?”",

      "content": "Chapter 74: Visiting The Prison\nQiu Tong asked softly, not understanding why the three children had suddenly become so strange.\nQiu Xingyu turned his head away, looking as if he did not want to talk to her. Qiu Xingqiao and Qiu Xingyu stood on the same side as their elder brother and remained silent.\nQiu Tong gently pulled Qiu Xingyuan over and forcefully pulled his hands in front of her.\n“Let me see.”\nQiu Xingyuan’s hidden item was actually a photo.\nJagged lines ran across the photo. It was obvious that someone had torn the photo apart and pieced it back together with tape.\nQiu Tong looked at the photo in her hand. Her heart filled with shock as memories flashed across her mind.\nIt was a photo of a woman and a middle-aged man.\nThe woman had a beautiful face, lively eyes and was in high spirits. It was Qiu Tong from a few years ago.\nThe middle-aged man beside her stood tall and straight. He had a scholarly aura which was very appealing.\nAnd the reason for her shock was that this man actually looked exactly like her late father!\nQiu Tong looked at the picture with a complicated expression. She had not inherited Qiu Tong’s memory, so she did not know Qiu Rong’s appearance and temperament. The only information she knew was based on the book’s description of Qiu Rong.\nShe couldn’t help but feel a little strange. She felt that some things were really too coincidental.\n“This is… your grandfather?”\n“Give the photo back to me.”\nQiu Xingyuan looked at Qiu Tong’s profound gaze and panicked. He was afraid that she would tear the photo apart again, so he pounced on her, preparing to snatch the photo away.\nQiu Tong stood up and raised the photo high above her head. She looked down at the jumping child and asked seriously.\n“Where did you get this photo? And why did you keep it?”\n“As long as you tell the truth, I will return the photo to you.”\nQiu Xingyuan glared at her reluctantly. In the end, he gave in as Qiu Tong had the height advantage.\nHe said petulantly, “Ever since grandpa went to prison, you’ve been cursing and swearing at home every day. You keep blaming Grandpa for the loss of your good life and the status of the eldest daughter of the Qiu family. Falling from heaven to hell.”\n“So you threw out all of Grandpa’s belongings, including his photos. You tore them into pieces.”\n“While you were otherwise occupied, we found all these photo fragments in the trash. It took a lot to piece together such a complete picture.”\n“Grandpa treated us very well before he went to prison. We’ve been on the constant move and our lives were unstable. Grandpa remained very concerned about us and our studies. He’s very kind, so we like Grandpa alot and miss him very much.”\n“Grandpa has been in prison for so many years but you’ve only brought us to visit twice.”\n“We can only secretly take a look at the photo when we miss Grandpa, in case we forget what he looks like.”\nQiu Tong’s emotions were in turmoil. She finally understood why the three children had such grim expressions. They must have heard her refusal to visit their Grandpa in the prison.\nHer gaze once again fell upon the photo in her hand. Looking at Qiu Rong’s face, which was the same as her birth father’s, she decided to visit him. She hoped that after seeing Qiu Rong, she would be able to solve the doubts in her heart.\nQiu Tong placed the photo back into Qiu Xingyuan’s hands and gently rubbed his head. Her gaze was gentle.\n“You’re all good children. Mommy’s previous way of thinking was wrong. After seeing how filial you guys are, I feel that you are right.”\n“I’ll go and visit your grandfather now, but you heard what the prison guards said. There’s a widespread epidemic in the prison. There are many unknown dangers and variables.”\n“So this time, I won’t bring you guys along. Once the situation there stabilizes, I promise I’ll bring you guys to visit Grandpa.”\nQiu Xingyuan saw that Qiu Tong’s words were sincere, and he had also heard the contents of the phone call, so he knew that she was not lying to them. He nodded stiffly, and the anxiety and wariness in his eyes eased a little.\nQiu Xingqiao and Qiu Xingyu were extremely excited. They were filled with anticipation for the next time they would visit Grandpa.\nQiu Tong hurried over to the prison. After she was done with the procedures, she put on a mask and was brought to a transparent window by a prison guard.\n“According to the epidemic prevention rules, you only have twenty minutes with him.”\n“Thank you.”\nQiu Tong nodded before turning to look at Qiu Rong.",

      "content": "Chapter 75: Danger\nQiu Rong’s face was pale and sickly, but his gentle demeanor hadn’t changed at all. He looked at his daughter with a smile.\nHe… really looked exactly like her father!\nThe moment Qiu Tong saw him, a sense of familiarity and nostalgia gushed out of her heart. She instinctively picked up the phone by the window and called him “Daddy”.\nQiu Rong was slightly taken aback. Ever since he was arrested, Qiu Tong had never called him “Daddy” again. His eyes instantly became moist.\n“Tongtong, you’ve grown up.”\nQiu Tong did not know why, but it all felt very natural when she told Qiu Rong about the recent events, about all the changes and interesting things that had happened to the children. She looked at Qiu Rong, who was smiling very gently, and whose eyes were filled with tolerance. Her heart surged with emotions.\nQiu Rong looked at his daughter, who was behaving very differently from before. She was not hysterical nor was she cursing viciously. Instead, she was exuding confidence.\nHe nodded in relief and carefully reminded her about the things to take note of in her life.\nAfter their conversation, Qiu Tong felt that Qiu Rong was not at all like those vicious swindlers. Furthermore, after hearing that Qiu Rong had been engaged in charity work, she was filled with questions.\n“Daddy, did you really commit fraud? Is there… something I don’t know?”\n“No. Who did you hear that nonsense from?”\nQiu Rong immediately denied it, looking somewhat guarded. “You’ve been here long enough today. It’s time to go back.”\nQiu Rong’s evasive attitude made Qiu Tong’s heart skip a beat. She made up her mind.\nHe was afraid of something.\nIf he didn’t commit fraud, then obviously someone had set him up. But he didn’t dare to tell others.\nShe took a deep look at Qiu Rong. A person who could make him so fearful was definitely someone of high status and power.\nQiu Tong was silent for a moment, then she smiled again, as if she had never asked the question before. She continued to talk to her father, but secretly used her power to help Qiu Rong heal his illness.\n20 minutes passed quickly and Qiu Tong had to leave at the urging of the prison guards.\nHowever, she didn’t leave immediately. Instead, she went to look for the warden to discuss offering compensation for a reduction in Qiu Rong’s sentence. She met someone completely unexpected.\nWhy was he here?\nJin Yang didn’t expect to see Qiu Tong here either. “You…”\nHe came here today to meet the S+Class criminal, Dina.\nDina was the former leader of a terrorist organization. He had collaborated with many foreign forces and created many terrorist operations. He was extremely cunning and they had paid a huge price to capture him.\nThe terrorists whom Jin Yang and Qiu Tong had worked together to eliminate were only a branch of this organization. From this, one could see how terrifying their power was.\nDina’s people were sinister, cunning and extremely vicious. Even though the military had tried their best and used all kinds of methods, this person stubbornly refused to talk.\nTherefore, in order to find out more about the terrorist organization that Dina was in, and to find out where they were located, Jin Yang personally came to the prison for interrogation.\nQiu Tong pointed at the other room and said, “I’m here to see my father.”\nJin Yang’s ears turned slightly red when he saw Qiu Tong and recalled what had happened in the villa before they parted.\n“I’m here for an interrogation. Wait for me, I’ll go out with you.”\nQiu Tong nodded. She was going to talk to the warden about compensation and reducing her father’s prison sentence.\nJin Yang pushed the door open and entered. When he faced Dina, his entire aura suddenly changed. “Dina, you are now our prisoner. You have no choice but to cooperate with us.”\n“I came to see you personally. You should know how determined we are in this matter.”\n“I advise you to explain to me about your organization while I am still being nice to you. Otherwise, I’ll let you know how vicious I can be.”\nDina was experienced with interrogation methods. His gaze was malicious as he looked at Jin Yang provocatively.\n“It was my biggest mistake not being able to kill you with one shot.”\nJin Yang looked at Dina and suddenly smiled. He leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms.\n“Too bad. I won. That’s why I’m king.”\n“No matter how regretful you are, you have to suffer the rest of your days in prison.”\n“Tell me everything about your organization. I might be able to spare your life.”\nWhen Dina heard the word “life”, a flash of madness passed through his eyes. He feigned a nod, leaned forward and softened his tone.\n“Alright, I’ll tell you everything you want to know…”\nQiu Tong stood outside the interrogation room, watching the two of them confront each other through the glass.\nAll of a sudden, she felt all the blood freeze and her limbs turned cold. Years of combat experience told her that there was danger!",

      "content": "Chapter 76: Threat And Enticement\nQiu Tong suddenly raised her head to look at Dina and saw the madness and bloodlust in his eyes.\nIn that split second, Qiu Tong did not have time to think. She immediately broke through the door and pulled Jin Yang away from Dina’s optimum attack range!\n“Be careful!”\nAs expected, Dina had already unlocked his handcuffs. He raised the knife he had taken from the cafeteria and stabbed it at Jin Yang!\nObviously, he didn’t expect a woman to suddenly rush in and ruin his plans. His expression was ferocious as he immediately tried to stab Qiu Tong in the back.\nJin Yang also reacted at this time. He raised his hand and knocked away the knife in Dina’s hand, rapidly exchanging blows with Dina.\nQiu Tong also quickly joined the battle. The two of them were experts in combat, and now that it was two against one, they suppressed Dina without any problem.\nJin Yang cuffed Dina again and turned to look at Qiu Tong.\n“Are you all right?”\n“I’m fine. You’re the one who’s injured.”\nQiu Tong looked at the blood on his hand.\nOnly then did Jin Yang feel the pain. He had been cut when he was trying to protect Qiu Tong.\nWithout thinking, Qiu Tong held Jin Yang’s injured right hand and used her power to heal him.\nJin Yang felt the smoothness in his hands. The familiar feeling in his heart appeared again. However, he felt a splitting headache and his face turned even paler.\nWhen Qiu Tong saw this, she thought that he had been injured in some other way. She quickly examined him, and only then did she detect the same virus as Qiu Rong in his body.\n“Are you infected too?”\nQiu Tong suddenly turned to look at Dina. Apart from Dina, no one else could have transmitted the virus to Jin Yang.\nDina’s eyes were bloodshot. He licked his dry lips and looked at them with a crazed look.\n“That’s right. I’ve been infected too. My immune system has been compromised. There’s no special medicine to treat this epidemic. I can only wait for death.”\n“If I can drag you along as I die, it would be worth it.”\nQiu Tong treated all of Jin Yang’s injuries and viral infection, before putting down his hand and asking him, “What do you want from him?”\nJin Yang looked at his hands in dismay. It was only when he heard Qiu Tong’s second question that he came back to his senses and told her his purpose of coming here.\n“I see. Then I should be able to help you accomplish your goal.”\nQiu Tong smiled and looked at Dina. “As long as you tell me everything, I can cure you.”\nDina raised his head and looked at Qiu Tong, his eyes filled with hope.\nHowever, the light in his eyes quickly dimmed.\nThese government officials wanted to trick him into working for them. Did they really think he was a fool?\nQiu Tong sat opposite Dina and stared at him. “Dina, as long as you tell us the situation of all the terrorist organizations and help the government eliminate or enlist those people, you can live.”\n“You should know that I am the only one here who can save you.”\nStill handcuffed, Dina smashed the table in front of him!\n“If there is really some special medicine, you would have already taken it out to treat the others. I will never believe your nonsense!”\nQiu Tong had long known that he would not be compliant. Dina was not only vicious and cruel, but also very suspicious. He would not be so gullible.\nIf she couldn’t produce convincing evidence, he would never agree.\nQiu Tong whispered in Jin Yang’s ear.\nJin Yang understood and nodded. He made a call and someone came in with a syringe.\nQiu Tong picked up the syringe and skillfully expelled the air from it. An arc of transparent liquid shot out in the air.\n“Dina, you can choose not to believe me, but you have to believe in your own body.”\n“This is the latest drug that we’ve developed. Once you inject it, the effects will be immediate and it will relieve your symptoms very quickly.”\n“As long as you cooperate, I will do my best for the follow-up treatment.”\nQiu Tong slowly injected the medicine into Dina’s body. She looked at his flickering eyes and knew that he was wavering.\nDina immediately felt the changes in his body. He suddenly had hope for survival.\nThere was really a special medicine…\nQiu Tong held the empty syringe in front of Dina, her voice had an enticing pitch.\n“Look, your chance at survival is right in front of you. What’s there to worry about? The right choice is to hold onto it tightly.”",

      "content": "Chapter 77: Misunderstanding\nEnticed by Qiu Tong’s offer, Dina finally gave in and lowered his head.\n“As long as you can treat my illness, I’m willing to help you.”\nJin Yang got the answer he wanted. He waved his hand and had his men take Dina away.\n“Well done.”\nJin Yang’s slender fingers played with the syringe as he looked at Qiu Tong with admiration.\nQiu Tong smiled. In fact, there was no special medicine. It was just normal vitamins. She had used her special ability.\nShe had merely joined hands with Jin Yang to put on a show for Dina.\n“Jin Yang, Dina is an S+Class criminal. He will typically be in solitary confinement and escorted at all times. He will not come into contact with other criminals.”\n“However, even he has contracted the infectious disease. It means that the disease is highly infectious, and the method of transmission is unknown.”\n“There are people visiting here every day. If we let the disease spread, it might affect the entire country.”\n“Therefore, I suggest that we eliminate the root cause of the epidemic in prison. At the same time, stop all visits and seal off the prison before the epidemic is completely resolved.”\nThe warden was just entering the room when heard Qiu Tong’s words. He immediately retorted, “That’s impossible.”\n“How do you maintain the normal operations of the prison when it is completely sealed?”\n“Don’t talk nonsense here.”\nJin Yang didn’t even look at the warden. His voice was filled with dominance as he said, “I’m here. Do you have the right to speak?”\nIt was only then that the warden remembered that Jin Yang was also there. He repeatedly assured that he wouldn’t dare and his attitude immediately became humble.\n“Just do as Qiu Tong says. Seal off the prison. People are only allowed to enter and not leave. If I find anyone missing, you’ll be held responsible.”\nIt would take a few days to completely eliminate the epidemic.\nQiu Tong did not expect things to turn out this way. Thinking of her children, she called the estate management.\n“Hello, I’m the owner of Villa 23. My name is Qiu Tong.”\n“I can’t go home for a while because something happened at the last minute, so I was hoping you could go to my house and help me tell my children and assist with their food requirements. I’ll pay you when I get back.”\n“They don’t have cell phones. I can’t reach them.”\nThe estate management staff immediately agreed. After hanging up the phone, he rushed to Qiu Tong’s house.\nWhen he arrived at the door, he realized that someone had installed an electric net outside the villa. There was a sizzling electric current flowing on it, indicating that the electric net was live.\nThe staff had no choice but to shout at the door.\nBut the entire villa was as quiet as before. No one came out to respond.\nHe thought that there might be no one at home, so he had no choice but to go back first.\nIn the end, Qiu Tong’s message did not reach the children.\nPrison was a place where prisoners were kept. The only visitors were family members of the prisoners or the police who wished to interrogate the inmates. No one would spend the night there.\nThere was only one guest room in the entire prison.\nIt was arranged for Qiu Tong and Jin Yang to stay in this guest room together. There was no other alternative.\nQiu Tong shrugged nonchalantly and agreed.\nAfter all, they had shared a room previously when she was Jin Yang’s personal bodyguard.\nJin Yang nodded expressionlessly as well. Other than the tight line of his jaw, there was nothing unusual about his demeanor.\nQiu Tong knew that the most common transmission pathways for infectious diseases were water, air and saliva.\nHence, after entering the guest room, her first action was to check if there were any harmful substances in the air and water.\nQiu Tong turned on the shower head and looked at the water flowing down. Her small nose twitched and she frowned.\n“Jin Yang, come in for a while.”\nQiu Tong raised her head and shouted.\n“Okay”\nJin Yang knew that she must have discovered something, so he strode into the bathroom.\nMeanwhile, after the warden arranged their accommodations, he immediately went to the kitchen to have them prepare a meal. He then personally pushed the dining cart to the door of the room.\nHe knocked twice but no one answered. Seeing that the door was unlocked, he pushed the door open and entered.\nHe would not have many chances to come face to face with the President. If he did not seize this opportunity to leave a good impression on the President, he would have wasted all his years of being a warden.\nThe warden walked into the room but realized that it was empty. He found it a little strange. Just as he was about to call out, he heard sounds coming from the bathroom.\n“Jin Yang, be careful…”\n“I know. I just want to take a look.”\n“You can look but don’t touch.”\n“Hold on firmly…”",

      "content": "Chapter 78: Source\n“!!!”\nThe warden listened to the sounds of water splashing inside and the two of them whispering to each other. He could not help being dumbstruck and instantly imagined some amorous scene.\nHe could not believe that the President would actually be in the mood for such activities in the shower of such a place. He stood rooted to the ground for a long time, unable to recover from his shock.\nThe sounds of water flowing grew increasingly louder. Unable to stay on anymore, the warden fled.\nHe had just run out the door when he seemed to have remembered something. He turned around and gently pushed the food cart out.\nIn the bathroom, Qiu Tong was completely unaware of all that. She looked at Jin Yang seriously and raised the shower head high as she spoke.\n“Jin Yang, I think the source of the infectious disease might be in this water.”\nIn fact, Qiu Tong had only asked Jin Yang to come in because she had smelled a faint odor while checking the water.\nAfter hearing Qiu Tong’s explanation, Jin Yang wanted to take the shower head and have a closer look, but Qiu Tong stopped him.\nThat was what the warden heard.\n“Since we’ve found something, let’s follow the clues and take a look.”\nJin Yang turned off the shower and got someone to bring over a blueprint of the water pipelines.\nJin Yang and Qiu Tong followed the blueprint and found the water source. They traced the water source and found a dried-up lake.\n“Jin Yang, wait a moment.”\nQiu Tong walked towards the lake and saw that the riverbed was dry and bare. There were many dead fish in the pit that were already rotting.\nShe squatted down and pinched the dried mud on the riverbed. She placed it under her nose and sniffed it twice. Her expression immediately changed.\n“What did you find?”\nJin Yang came to Qiu Tong’s side and asked softly.\n“I was right. The problem is in the water. These dead fish must be the source of the disease.”\nQiu Tong pointed at the pit full of dead fish, her gaze solemn and heavy.\n“The water flowed through here and brought the virus to the water source below, causing the outbreak.”\n“Jin Yang, get someone to bring these dead fish back. I want to use them as a sample to research for a cure.”\nJin Yang waved his hand and summoned his subordinates, instructing them to obey Qiu Tong’s orders.\nQiu Tong stood by the shore and watched Jin Yang’s men collecting the dead fish. Her expression gradually turned serious.\nIt was normal for this lake to dry up during this dry season. When the rainy season came, the lake would be filled with rainwater again and return to normal.\nBut having read the storyline in the book, Qiu Tong realized that this was not a simple seasonal transition, but an omen of the drought.\nFrom now on, there will be very little rain during the summer and not a drop of water for months to come.\nIt wouldn’t take long for many lakes to show signs of drying up. Even the water in the rivers would slowly decrease. Smaller streams would disappear without a trace.\nWhen that time came, the farmers wouldn’t be able to water their fields, which would greatly reduce production.\nHowever, the effects of the drought were not just limited to this. There would also be locusts and epidemics.\nOnce people could not afford to eat and could not recover from their diseases, there would be no law and order. Chaos would reign over the entire society. The structure of the society would completely change.\nThe world will enter a period of famine.\n“Jin Yang, I feel that this is not just due to the effects of seasonal changes.”\nQiu Tong thought about it for a moment. In the end, she couldn’t bear to just sit back and watch the disaster happen. To look on as so many people died in the famine, without doing anything. Her expression was solemn as she looked at Jin Yang sincerely.\n“I think this is a sign of drought. After drought, there will usually be massive locust plagues. There might even be famines and epidemics.”\n“I suggest that you take care of the locusts in advance so that you won’t be flustered when things come to a head.”\nJin Yang frowned slightly, a trace of doubt rising in his heart.\nThis was just an ordinary natural phenomenon. The fish died because the riverbed dried up, and the lake happened to be right above the water source, which caused the virus carried by the dead fish to infect the water source of the prison, resulting in the epidemic.\nIt was pure coincidence.\nHe did not know why Qiu Tong was so cautious and excessively anxious.\nJin Yang’s gaze was probing. “Qiu Tong, locust plagues have not happened for many years. How did you determine that a major locust plague is about to happen?”",

      "content": "Chapter 79: Tyrant\nQiu Tong did not want to expose her identity, so she could not explain her source of information to Jin Yang. Her eyes flickered twice and she lowered her head so that no one could see the expression in her eyes.\n“We have to be on guard against possible disasters so as to not fall into a situation where we are caught off-guard.”\n“I just saw this phenomenon and made some connections, but I might be overthinking it.”\n“I think they’ve already cleaned up most of the dead fish. I’ll quickly clean up the water source first before I go back and develop a new cure.”\nQiu Tong knew that it was impossible for Jin Yang to believe her perfunctory excuse, so she quickly changed the topic and walked towards the water source.\nJin Yang knew that she was going to use her supernatural power, so he had his subordinates leave first.\nQiu Tong gently placed her hand on the water source and activated her supernatural power.\nThe water source, which was pitch-black and turbid, soon began to emit a faint green fluorescence. In the blink of an eye, it returned to its transparent state.\nAfter Qiu Tong cleaned up the water source, she returned to the prison with Jin Yang.\nThe warden had already seen those dead fishes, and his attitude towards Qiu Tong changed drastically. He hurriedly arranged a laboratory for Qiu Tong to use.\nQiu Tong didn’t really make the medicine. Instead, she got Jin Yang to send over a large amount of vitamin pills. She then infused her power into the pills so that they would be effective in the treatment of the disease.\nThis was the most effective and safe plan she could think of.\nAfter a few days, Qiu Tong finally finished making all the “special medicine”.\nShe had already exhausted a lot of energy to clean the water source, and then spent several sleepless days and nights creating the medicine. So she collapsed on the table after she finally finished.\nJin Yang jumped in shock and hurriedly caught Qiu Tong’s falling body. He sternly called the doctor over to treat her.\nAfter knowing that she had only fallen asleep due to over-exhaustion, he heaved a sigh of relief.\nHe looked at the side of Qiu Tong’s sleeping face and felt his heart beating even more violently. He covered her with a blanket quietly.\nMeanwhile, the warden was extremely grateful for Qiu Tong’s selfless sacrifice.\nAfter Qiu Tong woke up, he immediately invited her to the cafeteria to distribute the medicine to everyone and also asked her to explain some things about infectious disease.\nQiu Tong agreed.\nWhen she arrived at the cafeteria, the warden had yet to arrive. He was still leading his men to bring the medicine over.\nQiu Tong looked at the food in the cafeteria in boredom as she waited for the warden to arrive. She did not sense that a pair of malicious eyes was staring at her from afar.\nThe moment Wei Shuo entered the canteen, he saw Qiu Tong. He was immediately captivated by this woman’s gorgeous appearance and graceful figure.\nThis Wei Shuo was sent to prison because of attempted rape. After he went to prison, he relied on his strong build and ruthless character to become a tyrant in prison.\nHe walked over to Qiu Tong’s side with a tray in hand, his eyes filled with lust.\n“What crime did a young lady like you commit to be imprisoned here?”\n“But don’t be afraid. From now on, as long as you listen to me obediently, I promise you that you will be free and unobstructed in this prison. You will never be bullied by others again.”\n“Otherwise, I can’t guarantee what you will experience when facing these men!”\nQiu Tong cast a sideways glance at Wei Shuo, and her eyes turned cold. She was just about to speak when she was suddenly protected by a middle-aged man who suddenly rushed out.\nIt was Qiu Rong. He had received the notice from the prison guards to gather at the cafeteria.\nWhen he arrived at the door, he saw Wei Shuo cornering the young lady and smiling sinisterly.\nQiu Rong realized that it was Qiu Tong!\nHe was startled and panicked. Could it be that his Qiu Tong had been arrested too?\nIt was one thing for those people to send him to prison. It was another for them to arrest Qiu Tong too!\nQiu Rong had no time to bother about anything else. He immediately dashed forward and stood in front of Qiu Tong, mustering his courage.\n“Wei Shuo, this is my daughter. I beg you not to make trouble for her. If there’s anything, come at me.”\n“I didn’t expect you to have such a beautiful daughter. Why didn’t you introduce her to me earlier?”\nWei Shuo had never thought highly of Qiu Rong, this swindler with nothing. He raised his brows in cold contempt.\n“It’s your good fortune that I’ve taken a fancy to your daughter. Don’t ruin my plans here. I’ll take care of you too!”\nA ruthless glint surfaced in Wei Shuo’s eyes. He raised his fist and swung it towards Qiu Rong’s face!",

      "content": "Chapter 80: Taking Medicine\nHowever, just as Wei Shuo’s fist was about to make contact with Qiu Rong, it was suddenly grabbed by a slender hand.\nQiu Tong walked out from behind Qiu Rong. Her gaze was like a sharp knife as she glared at Wei Shuo. She grabbed Wei Shuo’s wrist and slowly pulled it back.\n“Now that you’re in prison, you have to change your ways for the better, understand?”\n“Stupid little girl, are you looking to die!”\nShe was very strong. Wei Shuo was in so much pain that his eyes revealed an ominous glint. He lifted his leg and kicked Qiu Tong’s abdomen. His kick was merciless!\nQiu Tong gave a cold snort. She raised her leg and kicked Wei Shuo’s calf tendon. With a crash, Wei Shuo knelt on the ground, sweating profusely from the pain.\nHe looked like he was kneeling before the two of them, lowering his head to admit his mistake.\n“B*tch!”\nWei Shuo looked like he was burning up with fury. He struggled to stand up and shouted loudly to the lackeys behind him, “Why aren’t you all attacking yet! Today, I’m going to let this woman know what a man is!”\nJust as his men were about to rush over, a sharp whistle sounded.\nEveryone turned around and saw the warden standing at the door with a serious expression. They could not help but stay rooted to the ground, not daring to move.\nThe prison guards whipped out their batons and went around to knock everyone back into place. Soon, the scene was controlled and the prisoners sat obediently on the chairs.\n“Miss Qiu, are you alright?”\nThe warden hurried over and looked at her worriedly when he thought of Qiu Tong’s relationship with Jin Yang.\n“I’m fine.” Qiu Tong shook her head.\nThe warden felt relieved and turned around. “Let me introduce you all to Miss Qiu.”\n“After her relentless efforts, she finally developed a special medicine that can treat the infectious disease.”\n“Now, she will personally distribute the medicine to you, as well as explain important things to take note of regarding prevention and subsequent care.”\nQiu Tong distributed the medicine brought by the warden. But when she placed the medicine in front of Wei Shuo, an unforeseen event occurred.\nWei Shuo stared at her unhappily, his eyes filled with grudging hatred. “The disease can be cured just because you said so?”\n“It has been just a short period of time. You probably haven’t even done any trial tests!”\n“What? Are you trying to kill us? Aren’t prisoners’ lives also human lives?”\nWei Shuo’s words instantly ignited the suspicions in everyone’s hearts. The crowd started questioning.\nSeeing that his daughter was being questioned, Qiu Rong was extremely anxious. He stuffed the pills into his mouth and said, “Since none of you is willing to believe, I’ll take them first!”\nHe believed that his daughter would not harm anyone!\nWhen these criminals saw Qiu Rong testing the medicine with his own body, some of the doubts in their hearts dissipated. They started to trust a little more in Qiu Tong.\nWhat if the medicine was really effective?\nBut Wei Shuo was still filled with suspicion. He said with an unfriendly expression, “Who knows if this is just an act that this father-daughter pair is putting on for us.”\n“If something really goes wrong from eating it, it will be too late to regret later.”\nAs soon as these words were spoken, everyone’s opinion started to shift again.\nQiu Tong had always been a decisive person.\nAfter she heard Wei Shuo’s words, she simply took back the medicine in front of him, returning it to the box held by the warden.\n“You can choose not to eat it if you don’t believe me. Anyway, not just anyone can take my medicine.”\nShe looked at Wei Shuo coldly and raised her head. Her sharp gaze swept across the crowd. “All of you too. If you feel that there’s something wrong with my medicine, you can choose not to eat it.”\n“You are free to choose. Death or survival.\nRight at this time, one of the prisoners sitting behind Qiu Rong suddenly began to cough violently. He squatted on the ground, wishing he could cough out all of his internal organs.\n“Cough cough cough…”\nThe epidemic in the prison had been going on for some time. Most people had been infected with the virus, and some of them had their immune systems severely damaged.\nThe prisoner knelt on the ground. The intense pain corroding his internal organs made him feel that he might as well be dead.\n“Cough cough… I can’t take it anymore. Let me take the medicine. It doesn’t matter if it’s effective or not. Let me take the medicine!”\nWith a fierce expression, he suddenly grabbed the medicine as if it was his final chance at life. He swallowed it!",

His recovery made everyone instantly recognize the effects of the drug.\nWhen everyone saw this, they picked up the pills in front of them and hurriedly swallowed them.\nAs expected, the sound of coughing in the cafeteria disappeared.\nThe crowd’s excited behavior was a sore sight for Wei Shuo.\n“Go ahead and take it. Who knows what side effects this medicine will have. When the time comes, you’ll know how evil this woman is!”\nWei Shuo shouted indignantly.\nBut this time, no one believed him.\nIn the face of life, they all chose to cling tightly to Qiu Tong, this life-saving miracle.\nQiu Tong was engulfed by everyone’s adoring gazes. They all expressed their heartfelt gratitude to Qiu Tong. Even Qiu Rong’s prestige and status among the prisoners had increased.\nThe prisoners who bullied Qiu Rong before felt especially awkward and guilty. They all came over to apologize to him one after another. Apart from Wei Shuo, the entire canteen was filled with joy and harmony.\nQiu Rong stared blankly at his daughter, who appeared very different from before. He was a bit lost in thought.\nHe already felt that his daughter’s character had changed a lot, but he did not expect her to be able to handle such a situation with ease.\nQiu Tong did not see the conflicted look in Qiu Rong’s eyes. She managed to escape the adoring crowd and dragged her father aside to eat.\nWei Shuo looked at Qiu Tong, who was now the center of attention. He exuded an indignant aura.\nWhen he thought about how he had been humiliated in front of everyone, how he had been completely subdued by a mere woman, the anger in his heart burned even more fiercely.\nHe would never let these two people off!\nWei Shuo called a few of his followers and walked towards Qiu Rong and Qiu Tong.\nHowever, he had only taken two steps when he felt a sharp pain in his stomach and a wave of dizziness in his head. His body swayed twice before he suddenly knelt on the ground and started coughing violently.\nWei Shuo’s situation instantly attracted everyone’s attention.\n“Oh no, Boss is coughing up blood!”\nOne of Wei Shuo’s lackeys cried out in alarm when he saw the bloodstains on the ground.\nThe rest of Wei Shuo’s gang scattered in all directions.\nThe way he coughed was exactly the same as when those infected people had their relapses.\n“Wei Shuo is infected too. Everyone, stay away from him!”\n“Yeah, I was just talking to him earlier. Would I get infected again by him?”\n“That won’t happen. Didn’t you hear what Miss Qiu said just now? After we take the medicine, our bodies will develop antibodies and we won’t be infected again!”\n“Yes, yes, yes. Luckily, Miss Qiu is here. Otherwise, we would be in danger.”\n“Wei Shuo is the only one now whose health is in critical condition. It seems that he’s the only one who didn’t take the medicine.”\nEveryone moved further away from Wei Shuo.\nWhen Wei Shuo heard their discussion, his blood surged so violently that he nearly fainted.\nQiu Tong watched the whole process calmly from her chair.\nThis was human nature. At critical moments, humans could surpass all imagination, and yet also behave entirely within expectations.\n“Dad, eat more fish.”\nQiu Tong looked away as if she didn’t want to see Wei Shuo’s miserable state. She placed a piece of fish meat in Qiu Rong’s bowl.\nWhen Wei Shuo saw Qiu Tong’s cold manner, he felt the pain in his body reach its peak.\nHe knew that once he got infected, he would not be far from death. He looked at the other prisoners who had recovered and knew that this medicine would definitely be effective.\nAlthough he was extremely unwilling, he had no choice but to stumble over and lower his head towards Qiu Tong.\n“Miss Qiu, please give me the medicine.”\nQiu Tong glared at him coldly, her expression unchanged as she listened to him gritting his teeth.\n“My medicine hasn’t been tested in any way. It might have side effects.”\n“I think a high and mighty person like you would definitely not want to use such drugs.”\nWei Shuo understood the sarcasm in Qiu Tong’s words and felt extreme regret in his heart. For the sake of protecting his own life, he had no choice but to humble himself further.\n“Miss Qiu, I’m sorry. It was my fault just now. I was talking nonsense. Please don’t take it to heart.”\n“Please forgive me and give me a way out.”\n“I promise that I will never cause trouble for your father again. I will be very respectful to him and will not offend him at all.”\nQiu Tong nodded. That was what she’d been waiting for.\nAfter she left, her father would be all alone. Although she was prepared to offer compensation in return for a reduction in his jail sentence, she did not know how long it would take. Hence, she had to find a guarantee for her father’s safety.\n“Remember what you said. Otherwise, I can take back your life anytime.”\nQiu Tong tossed the medicine into Wei Shuo’s hands, her eyes filled with a murderous aura.",

      "content": "Chapter 82: Is That Jin Yang?\nWei Shuo dared not say anything to that. He hurriedly swallowed the medicine in his hand.\nWhen the inmates saw that even the prison tyrant Wei Shuo had suffered such a huge defeat at Qiu Tong’s hands, and had no choice but to lower his head so humbly, they could not help but feel some fear towards Qiu Tong.\nIn just a few minutes, the people crowding Qiu Tong dispersed and there was no one left.\nQiu Tong was very satisfied with this situation and began to eat.\nShe had not slept or eaten properly for the past few days. She was starving.\nQiu Rong looked at Qiu Tong tenderly. The sight of this girl in front of him merged with the memories of his daughter. Thinking back to what had happened today, he could not help tearing up.\nThe Qiu family used to be a wealthy family, and he had spent all his efforts on Qiu Tong. Qiu Tong had lived up to his expectations and become an outstanding, capable and confident lady.\nHowever, when Qiu Tong was 20 years old, something happened in his life. He had no choice but to move and run away with Qiu Tong.\nAt that time, Qiu Tong became pregnant and didn’t know who the father was. And after giving birth, her personality changed drastically.\nShe became selfish, vicious, greedy and vulgar. She even hated her own children.\nWhen the children were three, Qiu Rong was arrested as a fraud.\nNot only was Qiu Tong filled with hatred for Qiu Rong, she also showed no warmth at all during her two visits to the prison. She kept cursing him maliciously and then never showed up again, as if she had completely forgotten about him.\nLater, Qiu Rong heard that Qiu Tong had vented all her anger on the three children, making their lives miserable.\nAnd now, as Qiu Rong looked at Qiu Tong’s familiar face, it was as if his dear daughter had returned to his side after six long years. He couldn’t help but feel deeply moved.\n“Tongtong, my Tongtong… it’s been six years, you’re finally back!”\nQiu Tong looked up from her plate in confusion. She looked at Qiu Rong, who was suddenly agitated. She asked in confusion, “Dad, what are you talking about?”\nQiu Rong observed her expression carefully and seemed to have thought of something. A flash of realization flashed across his eyes. “Tongtong, do you remember nothing again?”\nIt was the same six years ago. After her personality changed drastically, she completely forgot about what happened before.\nQiu Tong was shocked by Qiu Rong’s words.\nHe could tell that she was not the original?\nThis was someone familiar with the former owner of her body after all, and she had exposed herself in front of him.\nQiu Tong’s heart was racing, but her expression remained unchanged. Nevertheless, her eyes were filled with confusion.\n“Dad, what do you mean?”\n“You really don’t remember anything…”\nSeeing her like this, Qiu Rong could not help but sigh deeply. He looked at her with a complicated gaze. “So, you still don’t remember who the children’s father is, right?”\nIn the past, she had been unwilling to speak. But now, it was because she could not recall anything.\nQiu Tong did not have any memories of the previous owner. Before she came, she had been afraid that she would reveal herself in front of Qiu Rong. Now that she heard Qiu Rong’s conjecture, she was relieved and agreed with him.\n“Yes, I’ve indeed lost a portion of my memories, and I’m a little confused about many things that happened in the past… I don’t know what exactly happened either.”\nQiu Rong nodded. Actually, it was not necessarily a bad thing for Qiu Tong to forget those painful years.\nWith this thought in mind, Qiu Rong decided not to continue this topic. He looked at her lovingly. “It’s okay if you don’t remember. It’s good that you’re back.”\nQiu Tong, “…”\nShe did not understand what Qiu Rong meant and wisely chose not to speak.\nOver the past few days, Qiu Tong had solved the problem of the infectious disease in the prison, while Jin Yang had also gotten the answer he wanted from Dina. Neither of them had any reason to stay here.\nOutside the door, Jin Yang, who was dressed in a suit, said to the warden, “Call Qiu Tong out. We’re going back.”\nHe planned to give her a ride.\nThe warden hurriedly opened the door and walked in. He came to Qiu Tong’s side and smiled apologetically at her before saying, “Miss Qiu, Sir is already waiting for you outside.”\nQiu Rong looked in the direction of the warden, his gaze passing through the door and landing on the man outside.\nHis eyes suddenly froze and the expression on his face turned into fear.\nHe pointed a trembling finger at Jin Yang, who was standing outside the door, fear and panic filling his eyes.\n“Tongtong, that person… is he Jin Yang?!”",

You absolutely must not have anything to do with them, understand?!”\n“Jin Tao is not a good person. You must not get involved with him!”\nSong Yan was Jin Tao’s son?\nQiu Tong didn’t know who Jin Tao was. But she could see her father’s fear from his expression and actions. There must have been some long history between Jin Tao and her father!\nShe looked at Qiu Rong’s unusual behavior and suddenly asked.\n“Dad, is your arrest related to Jin Tao?”\nQiu Rong shook his head almost reflexively and said quickly, “No!”\n“Tongtong, everything that happened to me has nothing to do with others. It’s all my fault.”\nQiu Tong took in his guilty look, which further confirmed her suspicions. Her heart sank.\nShe did not want there to be a lifelong grudge between her and Song Yan.\nQiu Tong did not know why she had such thoughts. Her heart was in a mess.\n“Dad, don’t worry. I still have three children with me. I don’t have time to think about all these messy things.”\n“I just want you to come out quickly so that our family can reunite.”\n“Before I came, the children were all clamoring to see you. If not for the sudden epidemic in the prison this time, they would have definitely come with me.”\nWhen Qiu Rong heard his daughter talking about his three grandchildren, the expression on his face gradually softened. His tense body also slowly relaxed, and he nodded.\n“Tongtong, as long as you guys are fine, I don’t mind.\n“Dad, don’t say that. Our good days will come later.”\nQiu Tong held his hand tightly and said softly, “Take care of yourself then. I’ll leave first. After some time has passed, I’ll bring the children over to see you.”\n“Alright, let’s go.”\nQiu Rong watched as his daughter walked towards Song Yan. His eyes narrowed and he had a bad premonition.\nWere these two really not involved?\nThe warden sent Jin Yang and Qiu Tong out of the door. Jin Yang went to prepare the car. Qiu Tong turned to the warden and finally asked what she had been wanting to ask.\n“Warden, my father went to prison because of fraud. I remember that as long as you offer a certain amount of compensation, you can reduce a jail sentence.”\n“My father isn’t young anymore, and he just contracted an infectious disease. Although he’s recovered, I’m still worried about his health.”\n“So, if possible, I would like to offer compensation in exchange for a lighter sentence for my father.”\nThe warden nodded and said, “According to the rules, you can indeed reduce a jail sentence.”\n“But the amount of money your father swindled is very large. Going by that, you will have to compensate $800,000 to reduce his sentence by a year.”\n“Alright, I understand. Please take care of my father during this period of time.”\nQiu Tong had a plan. She would do this for herself, for this second chance at life in this body. It would also be for Qiu Rong, who looked exactly like her father in her previous life. She wanted Qiu Rong to be released as soon as possible.\nIt could be considered fulfilling a filial duty on behalf of the former owner of her body.\nQiu Tong made up her mind. She was going to take on more jobs and earn more money so that her family could be reunited.\n“Miss Qiu, you’ve done us such a big favor this time. Of course, I’ll take good care of your father. Don’t worry about that.”\nThe warden said hurriedly. Whether it was because of Qiu Tong’s ability or her relationship with Jin Yang, he would definitely help her.\nJin Yang drove the car over then. Qiu Tong nodded at the warden and turned around to leave.\n“This is my place. Thank you for sending me back.”\nWhen Qiu Tong saw the familiar gate, she unbuckled her seatbelt and prepared to leave.\nAlong the way, Jin Yang tried to make small talk with Qiu Tong, but whatever words he came up with died before they reached his lips. Now that Qiu Tong was alighting from his car, he suddenly realized that they were going to separate again.\nHe pursed his lips. “You’ve helped me solve such a big problem this time. How about I treat you to a meal to thank you?”",

She waved at him and got out of the car.\nHowever, as soon as Qiu Tong swung one leg out of the car, she froze and stopped.\nShe looked at Jin Yang awkwardly as she gripped the side of her pants tightly.\nJin Yang heard the sound of fabric being torn. He was stunned at first, but then his lips curled into a faint smile.\nHe looked at Qiu Tong’s slightly embarrassed expression and cleared his throat, trying his best to suppress the urge to laugh.\nQiu Tong glared at him.\nThis jerk was laughing at her expense!\n“Let me help you.”\nJin Yang got out of the car and walked around the front of the car. He bent down and carried Qiu Tong out of the passenger seat. He then tied his suit jacket around Qiu Tong’s waist, perfectly blocking the view of her exposed thighs.\nQiu Tong thanked him in a low voice and kept her face expressionless, but she ran away quickly.\nJin Yang looked at her departing profile and finally burst out laughing.\nThis girl… was really cute.\nQiu Xingyuan witnessed everything from the second floor.\nLuxury car, strange man, jacket, intimacy…\nThese four words completely occupied Qiu Xingyuan’s mind. He felt that Qiu Tong’s old habits were returning.\nOnce this woman had a man, she would lose her mind.\nJust like this time, she left them in the house alone for a few days without leaving any word…\nHowever, this time, he would not allow Qiu Tong to bully his siblings. It was time for him to plan for the future.\nQiu Xingyuan looked at the locust pesticide on the table with a heavy gaze and had a plan in mind.\nActually, he had already successfully developed the locust pesticide last night. Initially, he wanted to give Qiu Tong a surprise, but he did not expect to see such a thing.\nTherefore, he decided not to tell Qiu Tong about this matter and to find a way to sell it himself.\nAs long as he had money, he could lead a rich life with his siblings.\nQiu Xingyuan brought the locust pesticide to the market. After looking around for a while, he found a corner and placed the pesticide neatly on the ground before squatting down.\nThe passersby saw that Qiu Xingyuan was only five or six years old, yet he already looked like a little adult, coming out to set up a stall to sell things. While they were curious, they also pitied him, so there were quite a few people who came over to inquire.\nHowever, when they found out that it was locust pesticide, they couldn’t help having doubts.\n“This child is all nonsense. The climate has been so good this year, how could there be a locust plague?”\n“That’s right. How many years has it been since a locust plague occurred?”\n“Kid, no one’s going to buy your locust pesticide.”\nAlthough Qiu Xingyuan felt that Qiu Tong was unreliable, he did not doubt her analysis of the possibility of a locust plague in the future.\nHe said calmly, “Have you seen such a long period of time without rain before?”\n“Have you ever encountered such a hot and dry summer?”\n“Such weather means that there might be a drought this year.”\n“Historical records tell us that there is a 50% chance that droughts will be accompanied by a locust plague.\n“If we don’t take precautions in advance, then all the hard work of the farmers this year will be wasted. When that time comes, the entire crop yield will be reduced.”\n“What’s more, even without the locust plague, spending a little money to buy this would make one feel more at ease.”\nQiu Xingyuan’s words made the surrounding people fall into deep thought.\nThey could not deny that this child’s words were indeed reasonable. If they bought some back, even if there was no locust plague in the end, they could still use it to kill some other pests. It would not be a huge loss.\nMost of the people took out their money, and a faint smile crossed Qiu Xingyuan’s small face.\nLu Zhiling, who was standing nearby, captured his look.\nLu Zhiling had just finished shopping at a nearby mall with Mayor Shen and was about to drive off for lunch.\nShe was sitting in the car and had her attention attracted by the crowd. She did not expect to see Qiu Tong’s son setting up a stall by the street.\nLu Zhiling had been to the villa area before and had seen this child with Qiu Tong.\nShe stared fixedly at Qiu Xingyuan, a trace of viciousness flashing across her eyes.\n“My dear, there seems to be a child selling things over there.”\nLu Zhiling hugged Mayor Shen’s arm intimately and said coquettishly, “I think that child definitely didn’t pay the stall fees. He’s taking advantage of his young age, but is disrupting the market and breaking the rules. Isn’t that terrible?”\n“Look, there are so many people gathered there. What if there’s a riot later? What should we do?”\n“This is a safety hazard. If something really happened, wouldn’t it be a stain on your reputation?”",

Watching the growing crowd, he could not help frowning.\nHe was no fool. Lu Zhiling would not target this child for no reason. There must be something going on behind the scenes. However, he had always doted on Lu Zhiling, so he was naturally happy to agree to such a small request.\n“You’re right. If you don’t learn to do things the proper way from a young age, you’ll become a scourge when you grow up.”\n“I’ll get someone to handle it.”\nMayor Shen nodded and made a call to the police.\nWhen the police received Mayor Shen’s call, they immediately moved out. Three or four police officers headed aggressively towards Qiu Xingyuan’s stall.\nThe police officers ignored Qiu Xingyuan’s struggles and the advice of the people around them. They confiscated all the pesticide and took Qiu Xingyuan away to the nearby police station.\nLu Zhiling sat in the car and watched coldly as everything unfolded. The corners of her lips curled up into a vicious smile.\nQiu Tong, this is what you get for opposing me!\nMeanwhile, Qiu Tong received a call from the police and rushed to the police station.\nOnly when Chief Officer Fang saw Qiu Tong did he realize that Qiu Xingyuan was her son. Thinking of the second lieutenant, who was closely linked to Qiu Tong, he had a bad premonition and cold sweat broke out on his forehead.\n“Why did you bring this child in?”\nChief Officer Fang gritted his teeth and looked at the police officer beside him.\nThe police officer lowered his head and laughed. “Chief, this is an order from Mayor Fang. We have no choice but to follow it.”\nChief Officer Fang’s expression changed as he cursed in his heart.\nHe could not afford to offend either of them.\nChief Officer Fang thought for a while and decided to deal with Mayor Shen. He smiled and said to Qiu Tong.\n“Miss Qiu, I think there might be some misunderstanding here.”\n“Let me make a call first. I’ll definitely give you a satisfactory explanation.”\nAlthough Qiu Tong did not look happy, she nodded.\nWhen Chief Officer Fang returned to his office, he immediately called Mayor Shen. “Mayor Shen, hello. I’m Fang from the police station.”\n“You ordered to arrest a child just now, his mother’s name is Qiu Tong.”\n“I met her at the police station previously because of some misunderstanding. Later on, a second lieutenant bailed her out.”\n“That second lieutenant seems to be on good terms with her. It’s very likely that Qiu Tong knows someone from the military.\n“So for what happened today…”\nWhen Mayor Shen received Chief Officer Fang’s call, he was having lunch with Lu Zhiling.\nHe put down his fork and knife, surprise flashing in his eyes.\nWho would have thought that this child’s family had military connections?\nHe looked up at Lu Zhiling, who immediately gave him a big smile.\nMayor Shen didn’t want to lose face in front of the woman. Besides, Qiu Tong wasn’t the only one who knew people from the military. His brother also had a lot of connections in the military.\n“So what if she knows people in the military? She wants to take advantage of her connections? Do what you have to do.”\nMayor Shen hung up after speaking.\nHearing Mayor Shen’s determined attitude, Chief Officer Fang knew that he wouldn’t heed his advice. He sighed heavily and had no choice but to follow Mayor Shen’s orders.\nChief Officer Fang walked out of the office and smiled awkwardly at Qiu Tong.\n“Miss Qiu, let me bring you to see the child first. I’ll tell you the details as we walk.”\nQiu Tong immediately stood up. She desperately wanted to know Qiu Xingyuan’s current situation.\nWhen Qiu Xingyuan saw Qiu Tong appear, he knew that he could not hide this matter anymore. Qiu Tong must have already known about his business.\nSeeing Qiu Tong glare at him angrily, he could not help but lower his head.\n“Qiu Xingyuan, do you know what you did wrong?”\nAlong the way, Qiu Tong had already understood what had happened. This time, she was really angry.\nQiu Xingyuan lowered his head even more, his voice barely audible. “I shouldn’t have gone to do business at the market without you knowing.”\nHe had been rather scared during his time at the police station. Knowing that he was in the wrong, he could only answer obediently.\nQiu Tong raised an eyebrow and asked.\n“What else?”\nQiu Xingyuan’s voice became even softer, almost a whisper.\n“I shouldn’t have kept it from you. That I’ve already made the locust pesticide.”\nQiu Tong thought to herself:?\nWell, this kid has been hiding a lot of things from me\n. Nevertheless, she remained expressionless.\n“Anything else?”\nQiu Xingyuan was stunned for a moment. After thinking carefully, he shook his head.\nSeeing that he really did not have anything else to reveal, Qiu Tong pointed at him and scolded in a low voice, “Qiu Xingyuan, your biggest mistake was not protecting yourself properly!”",

Do you know that you’re only six years old?”\n“You don’t value your own safety. Have you ever thought about what will I do if something happens to you? What about your siblings?”\n“I always thought you were a mature and rational child. I didn’t expect you to be so reckless.”\nQiu Xingyuan suddenly raised his head and looked at Qiu Tong in disbelief. His large eyes seemed to be able to see through her and see her true heart and soul clearly.\nWas this woman angry because she cared about his safety?\nQiu Tong looked at him and sighed helplessly. She reached out to pull his arm and looked him up and down carefully.\n“Are you hurt? Does your body hurt anywhere?”\nQiu Xingyuan heard that her tone was stiff, but it was still filled with concern. Suddenly, he felt his throat tighten and his heart ache. He did not know what to say.\n“Chief Officer Fang, can I take the child away now?”\nWhen Qiu Tong saw that Qiu Xingyuan was safe and sound, the anger in her heart finally dissipated.\nThinking about Mayor Shen’s instructions, Chief Officer Fang had no choice but to look Qiu Tong in the eye.\n“Miss Qiu, I’m really sorry, but… your child has indeed violated our city regulations, so we have to follow the rules.”\nQiu Tong nodded. She knew that Qiu Xingyuan was in the wrong today. “So, what’s your decision?”\nChief Officer Fang hurriedly said, “Miss Qiu, you don’t have to worry. Although your son has violated the rules by setting up his stall, there are no serious consequences.According to the rules, we will have to confiscate the goods he was selling and impose a fine.”\n“Thereafter, you can take him away. After all, he’s only six years old. We won’t be too harsh on him.”\nQiu Tong thought for a moment and nodded. Things were not so bad if it was just confiscation and a fine.\n“No problem. We were in the wrong in the first place, so it is only right that we are punished.”\nChief Officer Fang did not expect Qiu Tong to be so compliant. The huge burden in his heart was lifted and he hurriedly said.\n“Thank you for understanding, Miss Qiu. Come with me to make payment for the fine.”\nQiu Tong didn’t bring any cash, so she took out Jin Yang’s card and put it in front of Chief Officer Fang.\nChief Officer Fang’s eyes flashed as he stared at the card, not daring to breathe.\nIt was the Black Card!\nChief Officer Fang had the honor of seeing this kind of Black Card once before. He knew that the owners of such Black Cards all held highly-respected positions in the military.\nIn other words, this card not only represented wealth, but also status and power.\nThe expression on Chief Officer Fang’s face underwent a myriad of changes, instantly elevating Qiu Tong’s status by several levels. He had endless speculations in his mind.\nHis attitude towards Qiu Tong became more and more respectful, and his resentment towards Mayor Shen intensified.\nMayor Shen had really made him suffer. Qiu Tong was able to easily whip out this Black Card. This meant that she must be very familiar with the owner of this Black Card.\nQiu Tong just had to say a few words to that powerful person, would he still be able to maintain his position as the Chief Officer?\nHowever, he couldn’t go back on his word now. Wouldn’t that be revealing to Qiu Tong that there was something fishy going on?\nChief Officer Fang was caught between a rock and a hard place. He had a flattering smile on his face and was extremely respectful towards Qiu Tong. However, his heart was in turmoil. This made his expression turn a little strange.\nChief Officer Fang picked up the Black Card with both hands and handed it to the police officer behind the cashier’s window. His cautious manner made the young policeman nervous.\nThe young policeman trembled as he stuffed the Black Card into the slot. As he was too nervous, his fingertips trembled and he pressed a few more zeros on the back of the fine.\nBy the time Chief Officer Fang noticed that, the young policeman had pressed the confirmation button. There was no time to stop him.\nHe looked apologetically at Qiu Tong, his heart filled with fear and shock.\nHowever, he immediately relaxed. It was such a major sum that that transaction would never go through.\nHowever, in the next moment, the faces of Chief Officer Fang and the young policeman turned pale.\nFour words appeared on the screen—\nTransaction successful.\nChief Officer Fang, “!!!”\nThe young policeman, “!!!”",

He had never processed such a large amount of money before.\nQiu Tong was also very surprised. She stared at the Black Card with a complicated look in her eyes.\nHow much money did Song Yan give her in this card?\nQiu Xingyuan looked at the Black Card with an ugly expression as he thought of the man in the suit who drove Qiu Tong home.\nChief Officer Fang’s face turned even paler as he apologized profusely to Qiu Tong. “I’m sorry, Miss Qiu. Don’t worry, I’ll refund the excess money to you immediately!”\nAs he spoke, he turned around and grabbed the young police officer by the collar, dragging him aside. He then personally operated the computer.\nChief Officer Fang tried his best to control his trembling hands. After returning the excess money, he respectfully returned the Black Card to Qiu Tong.\nAnd this time, he personally sent Qiu Tong and Qiu Xingyuan out of the police station.\nAs he watched the two of them leave, he swore to himself that he never wanted to see Qiu Tong in the police station again.\nIf she came again, his lifespan would shorten by a few years.\nQiu Tong brought Qiu Xingyuan home.\nAlong the way, Qiu Xingyuan did not say a word. From time to time, he would look at Qiu Tong as if he was thinking about something serious.\nQiu Tong noticed his actions. She thought that Qiu Xingyuan had realized his mistake and was too embarrassed to speak, so she did not take it to heart.\n“Elder Brother, where have you been? Why are you back so late?”\nThe two of them had just entered the house when Qiu Xingyu skipped over and pulled Qiu Xingyuan along as she asked him.\nQiu Xingqiao also hurriedly ran over. When he saw Qiu Tong, his eyes lit up, but he quickly put away his joy and stood behind his elder brother with a straight face.\nYe Luan stood on the stairs and looked at them quietly.\n“You…”\nQiu Xingyuan was silent for a long time before he finally spoke. He looked at Qiu Tong. “Are you with the man who gave you the card?”\nHe stared intently into Qiu Tong’s eyes, not letting go of the slightest change in her expression.\nAlong the way, his mind was filled with the huge Black Card and the man who sent Qiu Tong to the door. Hence, once he reached home, he could not help but question her.\nQiu Xingqiao and Qiu Xingyu’s expressions changed drastically. They raised their heads and looked at Qiu Tong, anxiously waiting for her reply.\nThe word “man” reminded them of that previous jerk.\nThis woman… would she become like how she was before?\nQiu Xingyu did not care that the three of them were still in a cold war with Qiu Tong. She threw herself at Qiu Tong’s feet, hugged her thigh, and rocked her from side to side.\n“Mommy, are you leaving with that man? Don’t leave. I don’t want you to leave.”\n“I promise I’ll be good from now on. I won’t make you angry anymore.”\nQiu Xingqiao was not very willing to talk to Qiu Tong. He looked around and suddenly had an idea. He grabbed his younger sister’s hand and said softly.\n“You know what, little sister? I heard a story a few days ago.”\n“There was a divorcee woman who had three children with her. For money, she found another husband. Although her husband was gentle initially, his temper became very bad after they got married. He would get drunk and hit and scold the children.”\n“Thereafter, the three children fled the so-called home and wandered around on the outside. They were found frozen to death by the side of the road. After losing those children as targets to vent his anger on, the stepfather transferred all his grievances and anger to the woman.\n“In the end, that woman was beaten up every day and lived in regret forever…”\n“Do you think this woman is very stupid?”\nAs Qiu Xingqiao spoke, he observed Qiu Tong’s expression, hoping to see fear and regret on her face.\nQiu Tong looked at the three kids. One was deep in thought, one was coquettish, and the other was threatening. They were really capable of anything to achieve their goals.\nShe could not help but laugh when she saw the children looking as if they were facing a formidable enemy.\n“Don’t worry. I know that no man in this world is good. I won’t fall for them.”\nThe three little men in the room :”…”\nThere was no need to lump all men together. Those three little men were still worth a look…\nMeanwhile, in the capital, a man who looked exactly like Jin Yang was sitting on a chair. His slender fingers were gently holding a wine glass. As he looked at the red wine, the corners of his mouth curled into a sinister smile.\nHe raised his head and downed the wine in his glass, revealing the red mole on his neck.\nThis was the only difference between him and Jin Yang.\nThis man was Jin Yang’s younger brother, the real Song Yan.",

He has agreed to cooperate with us to eliminate the remaining terrorists.”\n“As the Mayor of S City, you have to treat this matter as the most important thing now. Do you understand?”\nJin Yang sat at his seat with no expression on his face. When he looked at Mayor Shen, there was not a single ripple in his eyes. His cold and powerful aura caused the temperature in the entire office to drop to zero.\nMayor Shen stood at the side, trembling with fear. His face was covered in a thin layer of cold sweat. He didn’t look the least bit formidable like how he behaved in front of Lu Zhiling.\n“Sir, please rest assured that our district will cooperate with your operations…”\nAt this moment, the office door was pushed open from the outside.\nChief Officer Fang carefully walked in with the locust pesticide and went straight to Mayor Shen’s side.\n“Mayor Shen, I’ve brought all these things over. Please see if there’s anything you want.”\nAfter Qiu Tong left, Chief Officer Fang thought about it and felt that Mayor Shen must have a motive for capturing Qiu Xingyuan.\nMayor Shen had personally ordered the arrest of a six-year-old child. Later on, when he had mentioned that Qiu Tong was related to the military, he still refused to release the boy.\nFinally, he came to a conclusion—\nMayor Shen wanted this batch of goods that Qiu Xingyuan was selling.\nOtherwise, there was no reason to make things difficult for a child.\nThis was also the reason why he brought Qiu Xingyuan’s goods to Mayor Shen’s office.\n“Shut up! What nonsense are you spouting in front of Sir?!”\nMayor Shen didn’t expect that Chief Officer Fang would come looking for him at this time. He shot Chief Officer Fang a meaningful glance and gestured at where Jin Yang was sitting, hinting at him to hold back.\n“Mayor Shen, what’s wrong with your eyes?”\nChief Officer Fang looked at Mayor Shen’s behavior and was a little puzzled.\nThis idiot!\nMayor Shen ignored him and bowed deeply to Jin Yang.\n“Sir, this is the head of our local police station. He came here to report on some small matters.”\n“Compared to our current discussion, those small matters are not worth mentioning in front of you. I will have him leave now.”\nOnly then did Chief Officer Fang notice Jin Yang. Looking at this man who he had only seen on television, his knees went weak and he almost knelt down.\n“Sir… Sir?”\nJin Yang turned his head and looked at the thing in Chief Officer Fang’s hands. A rare spark of curiosity arose in his heart.\n“What is that?”\nChief Officer Fang was so nervous that his mind went blank. It wasn’t until Mayor Shen nudged him hard that he reacted.\n“Sir, this is… locust pesticide.”\nChief Officer Fang calmed himself down. Oppressed by Jin Yang’s strong aura, he stuttered as he narrated what happened.\nJin Yang took out a bottle from the box and looked at the transparent liquid flowing inside. He recalled Qiu Tong’s words about the drought and locust plague and couldn’t help wondering.\nMayor Shen and Chief Officer Fang looked at the silent Jin Yang, not even daring to breathe too loudly as they quietly waited for his order.\n“Go and find out who invented this. After you find the person, buy the patent and let the factories produce this as a safeguard.”\nJin Yang placed the bottle on the table. He still leaned towards Qiu Tong’s conjecture.\n“Sir, the person who invented the medicine was a six-year-old boy called Qiu Xingyuan.”\nChief Officer Fang said hurriedly.\n“A six-year-old child has such high chemistry skills?”\nIt was rare for Jin Yang to be surprised. It seemed that there were geniuses everywhere. It was just that they had not discovered them.\nHe nodded approvingly. “Get ready. I want to personally reward this child with an award.”",

He did not expect for him to come up with something that would actually capture the attention of this powerful man!\nWhen Mayor Shen thought about how he had sent police officers to capture that child, his heart felt as though a huge rock was pressing down on it.\nIf that child were to form a relationship with Jin Yang, wouldn’t he be doomed?\nThinking of this, Mayor Shen couldn’t help blaming Lu Zhiling.\nChief Officer Fang was even more shocked and fearful than Mayor Shen.\nThis was because he suddenly realized that the child he had arrested today looked so similar to Jin Yang!\nThe two faces, one big and one small, gradually overlapped in his mind and finally formed a face…\nChief Officer Fang tried his best to suppress the shock in his heart. He maintained a calm expression and pretended to speak casually.\n“Sir, if you can personally present the award to that child, it will definitely be a supreme honor for that child.”\n“Speaking of which, that little boy looks somewhat similar to you… I wonder if you know that child’s mother?”\n“His mother’s surname is Qiu and her name is Qiu Tong.”\nJin Yang’s expression darkened. Before he could say anything, Shao An stepped forward and stood in front of Chief Officer Fang.\n“Who the hell are you to ask about his personal life?!”\nOnly then did Chief Officer Fang realize what he had just blurted out. His curiosity had overwhelmed him. He hurriedly took a step back and bowed to Jin Yang in apology.\nMayor Shen was also shocked by Shao An’s sudden change in attitude. He shrunk to the side and did not dare to speak.\nJin Yang didn’t expect such a coincidence. The child who was researching the locust pesticide was actually Qiu Tong’s son. They were really fated.\nHe recalled Chief Officer Fang’s words and couldn’t help but feel curious. After all, Qiu Tong had said something similar before.\nDid he really look like that child?\nNever mind. He would be able to see that kid at the awards ceremony. He’ll see what happened then.\n“Alright now, it’s not a big deal.”\nJin Yang said to Shao An as he waved his hand gently, gesturing for him to step aside.\n“Go and arrange the award ceremony.”\n“Alright, Sir. What do you think of holding it in the kindergarten that Qiu Xingyuan is in?”\nChief Officer Fang thought for a bit before suggesting.\nWhen Jin Yang heard Qiu Xingyuan’s name, his brows twitched. This name was not bad.\n“Fine.”\nAfter Jin Yang confirmed the venue for the awards ceremony, he left Mayor Shen’s office with Shao An. He still had many things to do to capture the terrorists.\nAfter Jin Yang left, the atmosphere in the office suddenly relaxed.\nMayor Shen collapsed on the chair, but then tensed up again.\nHe did not know whether Qiu Xingyuan was Jin Yang’s illegitimate son. But Jin Yang was going to personally present the award to that child, so he could not afford to get on Qiu Tong’s wrong side.\n“Chief Officer Fang, bring some gifts over to apologize to Qiu Tong and the child immediately.”\nMayor Shen thought for a while and decided that it was better for him not to show his face for now. “We must be more friendly and talk to her nicely. We must not let her speak nonsense in front of Sir.”\nIn the end, Chief Officer Fang had to go clean up the mess that Mayor Shen had created.\nChief Officer Fang cursed in his heart, but he put on a compliant face.\nAfter all, the higher the position, the greater the suppression.\nAfter Chief Officer Fang, he immediately bought gifts and headed to Qiu Tong’s place.\nQiu Tong opened the door and saw Chief Officer Fang standing outside.\n“Chief Officer Fang, why are you here? Is there any other problem with Xingyuan’s matter?”\n“Miss Qiu, I’m here to tell you the good news.”\nChief Officer Fang placed the gift aside and said excitedly, “An important figure personally acknowledged the pesticide your son developed. He will personally present an award to your son at the kindergarten.”\n“I think that this important person and your family is fated. Not only did he take a liking to the pesticide, he also looks very similar to your son.”\n“I’m here to report the good news and also to apologize. My men were rude to you previously. Please forgive us and don’t blame us.”\nQiu Tong frowned. She remembered that when she first met Song Yan, she also felt that he looked like Qiu Xingyuan, so she probed.\n“Is that person’s surname Song?”\n“No, his surname isn’t Song. You’ll see him at the award ceremony.” Chief Officer Fang didn’t dare to reveal Jin Yang’s identity and shook his head.\nQiu Tong felt even more puzzled. Her son didn’t have a common face, so why did so many people resemble him?",

This way, all the children would be able to receive sufficient protection.\nHowever, Qiu Xingyuan’s opinion of Qiu Tong’s arrangement could be summed up by one word.\nBiased!\n“Elder Brother, that woman only has eyes for Ye Luan now. She’s really too much.”\nQiu Xingqiao looked at his brother angrily, his heart filled with resentment towards Qiu Tong.\n“Does Mommy not like us anymore?”\nQiu Xingyu was also a little unhappy. It had been a long time since she last saw Qiu Tong standing at the door waiting for them to finish school.\n“In that case, we have to let her notice our existence.”\nQiu Xingyuan blinked and put his chemistry book into his bag. He then casually pulled out a piece of white paper, picked up his little sister’s pen, and drew a cartoon of a grimacing face on the paper for Ke Le.\nHe then left the kindergarten with his siblings before school ended.\n“Let’s go. I will bring you guys to the internet cafe to spend the night. We won’t go back until that woman comes looking for us.”\nMeanwhile, Qiu Tong had arrived at the school early.\nToday was Friday. The elementary school usually let off earlier than usual on Fridays.\nHowever, Qiu Tong waited at the entrance for a long time but did not see Ye Luan. After the last student left the school, she called Ye Luan’s form teacher.\n“Ye Luan said that he had a stomachache and left very early. I wanted to accompany him home, but he said that someone came to pick him up.”\n“Isn’t he home yet?”\nQiu Tong’s heart sank when she heard her teacher’s surprised voice.\nShe hurriedly hung up the phone and looked around for Ye Luan.\n“Ye Luan, Ye Luan!”\nQiu Tong shouted as she walked around, peering into every single alley. The surroundings became quieter and quieter.\nSuddenly, Qiu Tong heard something and her pupils constricted!\nShe quickly hid behind the wall and held her breath as she slowly approached a small alley.\nIn the small alley, Ye Luan was surrounded by more than ten strong men. From their stance and physique, these people must be well-trained experts.\nWhy was Ye Luan surrounded by these people?\nQiu Tong had a conflicted look on her face. She quietly drew nearer to them while scanning the surroundings.\n“Kid, I advise you to hand it over quickly. Otherwise, your tiny body won’t be able to endure our punches.”\nThe leader looked at Ye Luan coldly, his tone full of threat and coercion.\nYe Luan was silent, but his small face was filled with resolution. That stubborn look instantly angered the man.\n“Ignorant brat!”\n“Don’t think that I won’t hit you just because you’re a child!”\nAs the man spoke, he approached Ye Luan and raised his huge hand—\n“Stop!”\nWith that impending danger, Qiu Tong could no longer back. In a flash, she leaped forward and grabbed the man’s hand!\nQiu Tong’s eyes were filled with rage. She could clearly feel the strength of this man. If his strike had landed, Ye Luan would be severely injured!\n“B*tch, mind your own business.”\nThe veins on the man’s arm bulged as he quickly shook off Qiu Tong’s hand and threw a kick at Qiu Tong’s back!\nQiu Tong dodged to the side at a strange angle. At the same time, she grabbed the man’s shoulder and spun behind him. She hooked her other arm around the man’s neck and used her right leg to lock him tightly!\nThe others saw Qiu Tong’s skills and quickly attacked her, surrounding her in the center.\nQiu Tong was analyzing their moves as she fought.\nThese people had obviously undergone strict training. Their teamwork was very well-coordinated which amplified their combined combat strength. All signs indicated that they were not ordinary robbers, but more like soldiers.\nThe leader was also being increasingly amazed. He was well aware of how good his men were. Yet, this woman was able to fight them on equal terms.\nWho the hell was she?!\nAt that moment, the three truant children happened to pass by the side of the alley. When they saw Qiu Tong protecting Ye Luan behind her while fighting a group of men, their faces instantly darkened.\nThis woman was really willing to do anything for Ye Luan!\nLook, she provoked some unsavory characters again!\nWith a cold face, Qiu Xingyuan was the first to turn around and leave.. Qiu Xingqiao followed his elder brother and stomped away furiously.",

      "content": "Chapter 91: Entrust\nOnly Qiu Xingyu kept turning back. She asked in a small voice, “Elder Brother, Second Brother… will Mommy be in danger?”\nThe image of Qiu Tong and those people fighting kept replaying in the three children’s minds. Qiu Xingyuan’s footsteps gradually slowed down.\nQiu Xingqiao saw that Little Yu’s big eyes were filled with worry. He pursed his lips and became a little anxious.\nHe said awkwardly, “Elder Brother, look at how worried Little Yu is about this woman. If we leave like this, Little Yu won’t be able to rest easy the rest of the day.”\n“Why don’t we go back and take a look so that Little Yu can be assured?”\nQiu Xingyuan was silent for a moment, but he nodded.\nSince his younger siblings were worried about that woman, he would bring them there.\nIt was only because of his younger siblings… Qiu Xingyuan told himself.\nMeanwhile, the battle between Qiu Tong and those men had reached its climax. Not only were these men highly skilled, they also had excellent teamwork. After a long time, Qiu Tong had only managed to kill three of them.\nQiu Tong knocked down another man. In the next second, she sensed a major impending force coming from behind, while a man’s fist was coming at her from the right.\nQiu Tong made a snap decision to endure the attack from behind, so that she could counter the fist coming from her right. A fierce light flashed across her eyes.\nHowever, the pain she expected from the back attack did not come to realization. Qiu Tong heard the man behind her groan.\nShe seized this opportunity and hammered the enemy on her right onto the ground. Without any hesitation, she then threw a roundhouse kick at the face of the man behind her. The man’s body instantly flew out!\nTwo more…\nQiu Tong was just about to heave a sigh of relief when she saw the three children standing behind her. She could not help being shocked.\nWhy were they here?!\nThe three children had a pile of stones beside them. Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao kept throwing stones at the men who were attacking Qiu Tong. Qiu Xingyu squatted on the ground and handed stones to her brothers.\nThe three of them were doing their best to help Qiu Tong fight the enemy!\nQiu Tong was touched, but she could not let these children fall into danger with her.\nShe nimbly circled around the man in the lead and suddenly jumped up. She grabbed the man’s head with both hands, bent her knees and used her body’s gravity to throw the man to the ground.\nQiu Tong’s body did not slow down at all. Using the momentum from the impact, she instantly leaped next to the man closest to her. With a powerful elbow strike, she struck his temple. The man swayed twice before falling forward.\nHaving finally dealt with those few men after much difficulty, Qiu Tong quickly retreated to Ye Luan’s side and whispered in his ear.\n“I’ll distract them. Escape with your brothers and sisters.”\n“I am entrusting them to you.”\nWithout waiting for Ye Luan to speak, Qiu Tong shouted, “I have what you want! If you want it, come and get it yourself!”\nQiu Tong ran towards the other end of the alley.\nThe leader’s expression changed and he quickly chased after her with the others.\n“Don’t let that woman escape! Catch her!”\nWhen Qiu Xingqiao saw this, he immediately wanted to chase after them. However, Ye Luan suddenly grabbed his arm. “Auntie Qiu said that she wanted me to bring you away from here. Don’t waste her efforts.”\nYe Luan stared fixedly at Qiu Tong’s departing figure, refusing to let go no matter how Qiu Xingqiao struggled.\n“If not for you, we wouldn’t be in danger!”\nQiu Xingqiao couldn’t struggle free. He looked at Ye Luan with eyes full of hatred. He raised his other hand and punched Ye Luan’s face!\nA bruise instantly appeared on Ye Luan’s face, but even so, he still didn’t let go. He tightly gripped Qiu Xingqiao’s arm, not letting him leave.\nQiu Xingqiao couldn’t defeat Ye Luan, so he turned around and bit Ye Luan’s arm. It was as if he was venting the anger in his heart. His mouth was filled with the stench of blood.\n“Second Brother, let go of Ye Luan.”\nWhen Qiu Xingyu saw the blood on Ye Luan’s arm, her face turned pale. She was afraid that something would happen and immediately dragged her elder brother over to pull Qiu Xingqiao away.\nShe looked at the bloodstains on Ye Luan’s arm and his pallid face. She couldn’t bear to see Ye Luan like this and reluctantly used a handkerchief to bandage Ye Luan’s wound.\nYe Luan glanced at Qiu Xingyu and pursed his lips, not saying a word.\nQiu Tong ran out of the alley alone. Looking at the men chasing after her, she felt anxious. But the next moment, her eyes lit up!\nThere was a car by the roadside!\nShe sped up, opened a car door and rushed inside!\nThere was someone in the driver’s seat and he was just about to start the car.\n“Hurry up and drive!”\nQiu Tong threw a wad of cash at the driver and urged him.\nThe driver turned around and looked at her in confusion.\nQiu Tong looked at the familiar face and was stunned.\nWhy was he here?!",

      "content": "Chapter 92: Misunderstanding\n“Song Yan?!”\nQiu Tong gaped. “Why are you here?”\nSong Yan: “…”\nThis was the real Song Yan. He was waiting for his subordinate here and did not recognize the woman who had suddenly appeared.\nPeople usually mistook him for the president when they saw his face. How did this woman recognize him?\n“There’s no time to explain. Drive!”\nSeeing that the pursuing men had caught up, Qiu Tong buckled her seatbelt and looked at Song Yan anxiously.\nIn the rearview mirror, several burly men were rushing towards them!\nSong Yan frowned but still stepped on the accelerator.\nThe car sped away. But just as they passed an intersection, a black car suddenly appeared and slammed into them.\nThe car was pushed off the main road and nearly flipped over.\nSong Yan tried his best to control the steering wheel. From the corner of his eye, he saw two more cars crashing towards him at the same time—\n“Sit tight!”\nSong Yan quickly spun the steering wheel. The car made a 180-degree turn. With the screeching sound of brakes, their car charged out of the encirclement!\nIf not for the seatbelt, Qiu Tong might have been flung out…\nSong Yan usually looked so cool and calm. She did not expect him to be so wild when driving.\nThe car behind was following very closely, so Song Yan had no choice but to keep accelerating. Fortunately, he was already familiar with this area. After constantly changing directions, he finally managed to shake off the pursuing vehicle.\nTheir car turned into a remote alley. After confirming that no one had followed them, Song Yan stopped the engine.\nQiu Tong heaved a sigh of relief and nodded at Song Yan.\n“Thank you. I’m glad you reacted quickly.”\nThis woman seemed to be quite familiar with him judging from her attitude.\nSong Yan rubbed his chin and was about to ask how she knew him when she took out a black card and handed it to him.\n“I’ll return this card to you. There’s too much money in it. I can’t accept it.”\nSong Yan stared at the black card in front of him. He saw the English words engraved on the card.\nThis card…\nThis was a limited edition Black Card issued by the Royal Bank. The people who owned these were either rich or of royalty. But he happened to know the exact owner of this card in front of him.\nThis was Jin Yang’s card!\nWell, his brother not only flirted with women and gave them Black Cards, he even used his name?\nThe key was that he and Jin Yang looked identical. This woman probably really thought he was Jin Yang.\nSong Yan sneered in his heart. It seemed that this was the woman who had just withdrawn that large sum of money using Jin Yang’s supplementary card.\n“Since I’ve already given you the card, how can I take it back? Keep it. There’s not as much money as you think.”\nSong Yan pushed the card back.\n“But…”\n“No buts. You saved my life. Is my life so worthless?”\nSong Yan turned his head and sized her up. She had a petite face and a slender figure. But her eyes were clear and black, containing a firm strength.\nThis woman was very beautiful.\nHearing his words, Qiu Tong stopped harping on the matter and kept her card.\n“Alright, I’ll keep the card for now. I’ll return it to you when you need it in the future.”\nSong Yan smiled nonchalantly and even sent Qiu Tong home in a gentlemanly and considerate manner.\n“Rest early. See you next time.”\nAfter Qiu Tong got out of the car, Song Yan watched her leave from the window.\nQiu Tong did not know if she was overthinking things, but she felt that Song Yan was a little strange today.\nAs Song Yan drove away, he quietly noted Qiu Tong’s location and smiled coldly.\nSince they were young, their family always sided with Jin Yang. Jin Yang always got whatever he wanted easily, while Song Yan could only live in Jin Yang’s shadow forever.\nTherefore, he was always keen to snatch anything that Jin Yang had!\nIncluding this woman…\nSeeing that the children had not returned, Qiu Tong frowned and was about to turn around to look for them when she saw Qiu Xingyuan return with his younger siblings. Behind him was an injured Ye Luan.\nSeeing that she had returned safely, Qiu Xingyu couldn’t help but run over excitedly and look at her with widened eyes.\n“Mommy, are you alright?”\n“I’m fine.”\nQiu Tong stroked her head and saw Qiu Xingyuan walk past her with a cold snort, as if blaming her for causing trouble again.\nQiu Xingqiao clenched his fists and warned Ye Luan, “Jinx! What are you doing here?! Get out of my house!”\nYe Luan’s expression was cold. He opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something, but didn’t say anything.\n“Oh no, oh no! The children are gone!”\nA loud shout came from outside.\nKe Le, who failed to fetch the children from school, was just rushing back. He was holding the drawing the children had left in the kindergarten. “They also left you a note—”\nQiu Tong looked and saw the cartoon demon face on the paper. Its blood-red eyes were terrifying and had eight demonic fangs. Its bloody jaws were opened wide as if to eat humans!\nWith the demon’s clothes and hair, it was obviously a caricature of Qiu Tong.\nQiu Tong, “…”\nSo she looked like that in the hearts of these little kids?!",

      "content": "Chapter 93: Genius Painter\n“Painting Mommy as a demon? Tell me honestly, whose idea was it? Who was the one who drew this?”\nQiu Tong stuck her hands at her waist and demanded an explanation from them. She lowered her eyes to carefully observe the exaggerated and bold caricature of her.\nWith this artistic talent, she secretly wondered if the Qiu family could also produce a genius painter?!\nThe three children avoided Qiu Tong’s gaze and responded to her question with silence.\nQiu Tong rolled her eyes and covered her heart with her hand. She pretended to have a heart attack and said, “I’m so pitiful. I must be the first mother to be angered to death by her child’s drawing, right? I didn’t know I looked like this in your hearts!”\n“Do you know how dangerous the world is outside? Mommy hired Uncle Ke Le to protect you, but you sneaked out…”\n“What if something happened? How sad will Mommy be?”\nQiu Tong gasped in an exaggerated manner, clutching the drawing and comparing it to her own face. She shook her head and sighed quietly.\n“Mommy!”\nLittle Yu ran over to Qiu Tong’s side in a panic, supporting her by the arm and shaking her gently. Copying a doctor’s actions, she pressed against Qiu Tong’s chest. She looked back and stamped her feet anxiously.\n“Eldest Brother, Second Brother, quickly think of a solution. I don’t want Mommy to be angered to death!”\nQiu Tong smirked.\nAnxiety and awkwardness flashed across Qiu Xingqiao’s eyes. He explained stiffly, “That’s not you!”\n“We were drawing someone else…”\n“Really?”\nQiu Tong hesitated, wanting to believe it, but out of the corner of her eye, she caught a glimpse of the small line of words at the bottom of the canvas. It was neatly labeled—\n“This is Miss Qiu!”\nMiss Qiu?\nQiu Tong was speechless. She raised one fair finger and pointed at those words. She looked up at Qiu Xingqiao and asked, “How are you going to explain this?”\nThe three kids and Ke Le sank into an awkward silence…\nThe evidence was right in front of her eyes, but Little Yu suddenly thought of something. She snatched the drawing paper over and compared it with her little face.\n“Mommy! My brothers drew this small portrait for me. The kindergarten teachers asked me to be a model in an art class!”\n“Mommy is so beautiful and gentle… how could she possibly look like this?”\nAt this point, Little Yu paused and tugged at the corner of Qiu Tong’s clothes to comfort her. “Mommy, don’t be angry, okay?”\nQiu Tong’s heart nearly melted from all the coaxing.\nShe had not really wanted to fuss with them and she was now in a much better mood. She led them into the house.\nAfter returning home, Qiu Tong saw Ye Luan covering his arm with his school bag. She blocked his way back to his room and squatted down, pulling him to her side.\nShe looked at the clear bite mark on Ye Luan’s forearm and asked with a frown, “What happened?”\nYe Luan pursed his lips and refused to speak.\nQiu Xingqiao stood at the side for a while. He stared at the floor and admitted, “I bit him!”\n“Those people were chasing after you, but he stopped us from following you… so I bit him!”\nQiu Xingqiao told the truth with a straight face.\nGoing by how Qiu Tong was usually so concerned about Ye Luan, she would definitely reprimand him like the last time, right?\nQiu Xingqiao clenched his fists and leaned against the wall like a man, waiting for Qiu Tong to reprimand him…\nNevertheless, he still felt rather indignant…\nQiu Tong came to his side and raised her hand.\nQiu Xingqiao instinctively closed his eyes, thinking that he would be beaten. But in the next second, those gentle hands patted the top of his head.\n“Mommy knows that you were just too anxious in wanting to save me…”\n“Mommy told Brother Ye Luan to stop you guys. Next time, don’t hurt him on impulse. You have to apologize to him, okay?”\nQiu Xingqiao was surprised by Qiu Tong’s gentleness, while Little Yu looked at Qiu Tong with admiration. “I want to have my head patted too!”\n“Okay!”\nQiu Tong hugged the three children and patted them one by one. She said in a low voice, “Thank you for helping Mommy today…”\nWith her gentle touch, all the grudges between Little Yu and Qiu Tong dissolved. Little Yu smiled sweetly and obediently leaned into Qiu Tong’s arms.\nHowever, the two boys looked away stubbornly. From time to time, they would glance at Qiu Tong’s smiling lips and then look at Ye Luan with complicated feelings…\nIn the evening, Qiu Tong found the medical kit at home and brought Ye Luan to her side. She took off his clothes and looked at the few bruises on his body. Her heart ached as she narrowed her eyes.\nShe took some iodophor and dabbed it gently on his wounds to prevent infection.\nYe Luan endured the pain as his body trembled uncontrollably.\nQiu Tong knew that he could be very stubborn, so she asked softly, “Who was chasing you today? Why did they chase you?”\nYe Luan’s expression changed and his body stiffened. He replied calmly, “I don’t know.”",

      "content": "Chapter 94: Successful Battle For Favor\nQiu Tong could tell that Ye Luan was deliberately hiding something. She threw the cotton bud into the trash can and bandaged him.\n“I heard them asking you to hand over something. Do you have something that others want?”\n“Is that why those people are chasing after you? If that’s the case, you can give it to me. I’ll keep it safe for you for the time being.”\n“There are many of them. You are a child and it will be difficult to guard it. You might even be killed for it.”\nShe tried to persuade him seriously, but Ye Luan became wary of her. His dark eyes were fixed on Qiu Tong, his lips pursed into a straight line.\n“I don’t have anything.”\nSensing that Ye Luan was stiffening up again, Qiu Tong didn’t press further. Instead, she started to pack up the first aid box.\nQiu Xingqiao listened to their conversation and was very dissatisfied with Ye Luan’s attitude. He lifted his chin and walked up to him. “How could you do this?! It was because of you that nearly got us killed!”\n“In order to protect you, Mommy got into dangerous situations several times, but you refused to say anything…”\n“You’re not welcome here. Get out! Leave our home…”\nQiu Xingqiao pushed Ye Luan’s shoulders and looked at the delicate but taciturn boy in front of him. He snorted angrily. Ever since he came home, his mother no longer cared about them!\nYe Luan lowered his eyes in silence for a long time. He didn’t refute but bowed deeply to Qiu Tong and walked towards the door.\nQiu Tong saw that he was about to leave and hurriedly stopped him. She turned toward Qiu Xingqiao.\n“Little Qiao, don’t be like that. Brother Ye Luan has his own problems. There are many secrets that can’t be divulged casually. It’s just like how you guys also have many things you can’t tell Mommy. It’s the same…”\n“Mommy will protect you and this family. You have to promise Mommy to get along with Brother Ye Luan. Don’t say any more angry words.”\nQiu Tong tried to placate the children with furrowed brows. She looked at the mercenary Ke Le and said, “From tomorrow onwards, you will accompany me to send Ye Luan to school. This will be safer.”\nThe people who were pursuing Ye Luan today were quite skilled and liked to attack in a group. It was very difficult for Qiu Tong to deal with them alone.\nTherefore, Qiu Tong planned to have one out of the five mercenaries and protect Ye Luan with her.\nQiu Xingyu, one of the triplets, analyzed the situation quietly and felt a little disappointed.\nMommy still wished to escort Ye Luan every day and not them…\nSuddenly, her eyes lit up.\nThere was a solution!\nQiu Xingyu took the initiative to run to Ke Le’s side. She dragged two of the mercenaries over to Ye Luan’s side. She said in a soft voice, “Brother Ye Luan is in danger. More people should be assigned to protect him!”\n“I have Eldest Brother and Second Brother to protect me. I’ll be fine!”\n“Brother Ye Luan’s safety is more important. We’re nothing…”\nQiu Xingyuan was a little confused by Little Yu’s actions, but he quickly understood what she wanted to do. He added, “Yes, we don’t need mercenaries. I can protect them…”\n“Even if we encounter danger, we can rely on ourselves to escape.”\nQiu Tong was very touched by Little Yu’s thoughtfulness, but she knew in her heart that she could not really ignore their safety like they had said.\nShe frowned and pondered for a while. Then, she nodded and said, “In that case, let’s change it. I’ll leave Ye Luan’s safety to the four of you.”\n“From tomorrow onwards, Ke Le and I will escort them to and fro school.”\nQiu Xingyu quietly suppressed the smile on her face and placed her little hands behind her back. She made a “thumbs-up” gesture to Qiu Xingyuan.\nShe truly had a smart little head on her!\nThe battle for favor was a success!\nSeeing this, the two boys rubbed their noses and looked out of the window in tacit understanding. They pretended nothing had happened.\n…\nThe next day, the kindergarten held a parent-teacher meeting. Qiu Tong sat in the designated seat according to the teacher’s instructions. She did not expect Little Jin’s mother to be beside her.\nLittle Jin was the child who had damaged Qiu Xingyuan’s test tubes the previous time. They had an unpleasant experience together.\nLittle Jin’s mother remembered Qiu Ting’s arrogant and unreasonable attitude the previous time and was very unhappy with her. She deliberately moved away from the seat and kept a distance from Qiu Ting as she shouted.\n“A child really takes after his parents. Your child has such a bad temper. He must have learned it from his parents at home!”\n“Our children are in the same class as such children. I’m so worried every day!”\nLittle Jin’s mother snorted sarcastically at Qiu Tong.\nQiu Tong was reading the kindergarten teacher’s comments on the children and couldn’t be bothered to argue with the noisy woman.\nLittle Jin’s mother saw that she was silent and said proudly, “My child won the computer award! He’ll be able to go on stage to receive the award later!”\n“It’s said that with these awards and certificates, they will be given priority when choosing their elementary and middle schools!”",

Don’t be like some children who only know how to mix strange liquids. No idea what they’re doing.”\n“How old are they now? They think they are still in the countryside playing with mud!”\nThe children sat beside Qiu Tong and quietly clenched their fists. They suppressed their unhappiness and gritted their teeth, not wanting to cause trouble for their mother.\nQiu Tong noticed the children’s anger and raised her hand to rub the top of Qiu Xingyuan’s head. She also pinched Qiu Xingqiao’s puffed up little face.\nLittle Jin’s mother saw her placating the children and mistook Qiu Tong for being ashamed. She arrogantly pulled at the other parent beside her and deliberately pointed at them.\n“Those children have very strange tempers. They can’t play with other children!”\n“The second son is irritable, the eldest son is solitary and likes to play with dangerous things. Our Little Jin was almost beaten up by them several times…”\n“Do you think the kindergarten should screen the children’s family backgrounds? Someone who impacts the environment like this should really be chased out…”\n“Look, these children don’t look like they’re that smart. Maybe they won’t be able to pass the elementary school promotion test!”\nLittle Jin’s mother became more and more excited as she spoke. Qiu Xingqiao could not bear it anymore. His face flushed red with anger, and he jumped to his feet and said, “Nonsense!”\n“My Elder Brother is especially outstanding. We just don’t want to waste time with those idiots!”\n“Mayor Shen will be bringing an important figure to present an award to my brother! He’ll be presenting the prize himself! And he’ll be publicly praised…”\nQiu Xingqiao’s words made the surrounding parents whisper among themselves, discussing the credibility of Qiu Xingqiao’s words.\nLittle Jin’s mother looked extremely spiteful. She snorted twice and said, “What a joke. Do you think a big shot would be so free? To come here and give an award to a child?”\nThe other parents were convinced by Little Jin’s mother. Coupled with their own jealousy, they looked at Qiu Tong and the three children with disdain.\nThis was indeed a child who liked to lie!\nThe parents stole a glance at Qiu Tong, who did not try to stop anything or explain. They hid behind her and gossiped. “Look, this parent isn’t even going to stop her own child from lying. Children who are brought up like this will definitely become social delinquents in the future!”\nQiu Xingyuan’s eyes were suffused with hatred as he looked at them coldly.\nQiu Tong rested her hand on his little hand. Qiu Xingyuan looked up and was stunned to see her smile, which was gentle and comforting…\nHe pulled his hand back awkwardly, but the anger in his body gradually dissipated and returned to normal.\nOutside the kindergarten, Shao An arrived early to check the safety of the environment. When he passed the classroom, he saw Qiu Tong and the three children sitting beside her. He was so shocked that he stood rooted to the ground!\nHe rubbed his eyes and looked at Qiu Xingyuan through the thick and blurry glass window…\nAlike! Simply too alike!\nIt turned out that Qiu Tong had said that her children looked like Jin Yang not because she was lying or just trying to get close to him!\nThose two boys really looked like Jin Yang!\nShao An could not help but quietly speculate about the relationship between the two of them…\nBuzz—\nShao An’s phone rang. He hid in a corner and answered the call with his hand covering the receiver. He answered respectfully, “Sir.”\nJin Yang stood there, his aura cold and stern. “Come back now.”\nClick. The call ended.\nShao An frowned and felt that something was wrong. He immediately started the engine and rushed back.\nQiu Tong sat in the classroom and vaguely sensed someone dashing by. She looked over but did not see anything. She lowered her eyes again.\nShao An rushed back to the villa and looked around warily. Before he could ask what was going on, he heard Jin Yang say in a cold voice, “Pack your things.”\n“We’re setting off for the capital now.”\nShao An was stunned. He asked in surprise, “Sir, what’s the rush?”\n“You have to go to the kindergarten today to give the award to Qiu Tong’s son. You have no idea how much that child resembles you!”\n“I can help you adjust your schedule and flight. You can leave after you give out the prize…”\n“Or, just give me half an hour. I’ll go back and take a picture for you to see!”\nShao An felt some regret. He should have secretly taken a few photos of Qiu Xingyuan for Jin Yang. Looking at how much Jin Yang valued Qiu Tong, he would definitely be very happy.\nBesides, although he believed in the nobility of Jin Yang’s character, the child was so similar to him that he had to wonder if they were related by blood…\nJin Yang narrowed his eyes at Shao An’s nagging. He placed the glass cup on the coffee table and looked up with a murderous gaze.\n“My order is to return to the capital immediately.”\n“Are you trying to disobey my orders? Do you even know what delaying by half a minute would mean?”\nShao An was stunned by his aura and immediately nodded respectfully. “Yes Sir, your orders are to be obeyed! I’ll do it immediately!”\nHe turned and left the villa, hurriedly changing the day’s itinerary. On the way, he took out his phone and called Mayor Shen. “President Jin Yang has something to attend to in the capital. The awards segment for today is canceled.”",

      "content": "Chapter 96: Awards Ceremony\nMayor Shen had already arrived at the entrance of the kindergarten in a Mercedes-Benz car. When he heard Shao An’s notice, he paced around anxiously.\n“Why the sudden cancellation?”\n“All the guests invited by the kindergarten are already here. It won’t be good if we cancel now…”\nHe tried to find a way to mediate the situation, but there was no reply. He looked down at his phone screen.\nBeep beep beep—\nThe call lasted for only two seconds. Shao An did not even wait for his reply before hanging up.\nMayor Shen scratched his head in frustration. Just as he was thinking about how he should explain things to the guests, he looked up and saw a familiar figure.\nMr. Jin Yang?!\nMayor Shen ran over happily and bowed respectfully. “Didn’t you say you were returning to the capital? Why are you here now?”\nSong Yan happened to be looking for Jin Yang near the kindergarten. He had one hand in his pocket and was about to leave when he bumped into Mayor Shen!\nSong Yan raised his eyebrows and paused for a moment. He could tell that this person was here for Jin Yang.\nHe gave a perfunctory reply and asked in return, “You received the notice?”\nMayor Shen did not suspect this man at all. He hurriedly raised his phone and said, “Mr. Shao An told me that you want to cancel the award ceremony…”\n“But Miss Qiu’s children have already gotten the news that they will receive the medal. I was worried that they would be disappointed. It’s great that you could come.”\nSong Yan stuck the tip of his tongue between his teeth and smiled. He took the initiative to stride into the kindergarten. “Let’s go then.”\n“Don’t let the children wait too long. The award ceremony is an important matter.”\nSince it was something Jin Yang planned to do, he was interested in taking a look.\nWhen Mayor Shen and Song Yan walked out of the auditorium, the award ceremony was already coming to an end.\nMany children had already received the awards from the kindergarten teacher. Some were holding red apples high while others were holding certificates as they handed them to their mothers. The scene was very lively.\nLittle Jin’s mother flaunted the prizes that her child had won and looked proudly at Qiu Tong and the three children, who looked a little dejected.\n“Hey, I remember someone bragging about being able to receive an award from Mayor Shen and some big shot.”\n“Mayor Shen probably doesn’t even know that the kindergarten is holding an award ceremony today, right? How dare you brag!”\nQiu Xingyu was so angry that she felt like crying. “Don’t spout nonsense!”\nQiu Tong squatted down and hugged her, wiping a few tears off her face with her fingertips. She coaxed her gently, “A girl’s tears are the most valuable. You can’t just cry because of some random person…”\n“The same goes for you two boys. You have to remember that science is the same throughout the world. And it cannot be proven just by winning awards. Even if those people don’t come, don’t be disappointed.”\n“Mommy can buy you all these prizes when we get back!”\n“As long as you work hard and do the right thing, you will definitely achieve gains. Success at the starting line is not worth celebrating…”\n“The most important thing is to be able to stand on the podium after the finish line.”\nQiu Xingyu was comforted by her and ran to Qiu Xingyuan’s side. She looked up and said clearly, “Mommy is right, Elder Brother. You’re the best!”\nQiu Tong stared at Little Jin’s mother. The mother understood that Qiu Tong was saying those words for her to hear. Feeling increasingly annoyed, she deliberately put on a mocking tone.\n“It’s easy to give high-sounding sermons!”\n“Children who are already lagging behind at the starting line still wish to catch up with to the rest of us in the future? This is ridiculous!”\n“If Mayor Shen and the big shot doesn’t come to the award ceremony today, your children are liars and so they are bad children!”\nThe surrounding parents sized up Qiu Tong and the children.\nThere were only 10 minutes left until the end of the awards ceremony.\nWould Mayor Shen and the big shot really come?\nAt that moment, Mayor Shen was respectfully escorting Song Yan into the auditorium. They walked straight to the stage.\nMayor Shen tapped on the microphone and said in a very humble tone, “Please settle, everyone. There’s still an award to be presented.”\nEveryone looked up at the stage before gazing in shock at Qiu Tong. Even Little Jin’s mother looked in disbelief at Mayor Shen and the man beside him…\n“This is… the president?”\n“Why would he come to the kindergarten to present an award to a child? What kind of award is it?”\n“Don’t tell me it’s really for Qiu Tong’s children?”\nThe parents’ disdain and contempt for Qiu Ying turned to envy at this moment. They wished they could become Qiu Xingyuan’s parents and receive such an honor from that esteemed person…",

      "content": "Chapter 97: Failed In Her Duty\n“Qiu Xingyuan, please come on stage to receive the award.”\nThe guests at the kindergarten’s ceremony stood up and applauded along with the music of the awards ceremony.\nQiu Tong straightened Qiu Xingyuan’s suit and bow tie. She patted his shoulder and sent him to the side of the stage with a smile.\nQiu Xingyuan pursed his lips and raised his head. With a calm gaze, he walked to Song Yan’s side.\nSong Yan opened the red velvet gift box from Mayor Shen’s hand and took out the medal that was gleamed with a golden light. He bent over and personally placed it on Qiu Xingyuan’s chest.\nThunderous applause rang out from below the stage. Camera lights flashed repeatedly, capturing the current scene. The parents looked at Qiu Tong with endless envy.\n“Mommy, Eldest Brother is amazing!”\nLittle Yu excitedly stamped her feet and clapped her hands as she spoke.\nSong Yan followed the voice and saw Qiu Tong. He immediately straightened up and looked at Qiu Xingyuan’s face. His movements froze for a moment…\nThis child’s mother… was Qiu Tong?\nQiu Tong was the Miss Qiu that Mayor Shen had mentioned?\nSong Yan’s pupils quivered, before he concealed his shock.\nQiu Xingyuan’s eyes were very similar to Jin Yang’s, and his silhouette and aura were also very similar to him!\nTherefore…\nJin Yang didn’t seem to like women, but he actually had an illegitimate child?\nDid Jin Yang know about the child’s existence?\nSong Yan smirked. This was the best opportunity he had. He wanted to snatch this illegitimate son of Qiu Tong and Jin Yang, and use him to humiliate him.\nHe could not wait to see Jin Yang’s panicked and vexed expression. After thinking about it, he bent over and squatted beside Qiu Xingyuan. He pointed at the kindergarten teacher’s camera, indicating for them to take a picture together for remembrance.\nHe rested his hand on Qiu Xingyuan’s shoulder and casually pinched off a strand of Qiu Xingyuan’s hair.\nJin Yang and Song Yan were identical twins with identical DNA. With this hair, one could determine whether they were related by blood!\nSong Yan gathered the hair into his palm and smiled calmly.\nQiu Xingyuan found it a little strange. He stole a glance at Song Yan and felt that this man seemed rather familiar, as if he had seen him somewhere before.\nThe kindergarten teacher gestured at him, “Student Qiu, look at me!”\nQiu Xingyuan put on a stiff face and smoothed his hair as he turned to look at the camera. His posture was a little stiff.\nSeeing that his elder brother was so outstanding, Qiu Xingqiao glared at Little Jin and his mother with his hands on his hips. He called out in a loud voice. “Did you see that? My elder brother’s medal is the awesome one!”\n“A stupid certificate can’t compare to it! What’s so great about an award for computers? If Little Yu were to participate in that competition, she would definitely be better than you!”\nQiu Xingqiao childishly smirked and stuck his tongue out at Little Jin. He wanted to pay back all the grievances he had suffered!\nLittle Jin had been treated by his mother as a precious treasure since he was young. He was bold to the point of being audacious. At this moment, he was pointing at Song Yan and Qiu Xingyuan, who were taking a picture together on stage. He was speaking loudly such that all the surrounding parents could hear.\n“Hmph, what is this science award? It’s a sham!”\n“The Qiu children look very similar to the award presenter! Especially Qiu Xingyuan and him…”\n“Who knows what your relationship is! That award might have been won through connections!”\n“Mommy said that as long as you donate money to the kindergarten, you can win awards in exchange. You must have spent more money than us!”\nLittle Jin bluntly revealed the “dark side” of the kindergarten. Little Jin’s mother was so frightened that her legs went limp and she rushed over. She covered his mouth and turned her head to look at Song Yan guiltily.\n“Sir… don’t listen to his nonsense! Children are ignorant!”\nLittle Jin’s mother was very frightened. How dare this child speak nonsense in front of the president!\nSong Yan personally accompanied Qiu Xingyuan to the middle of the crowd. He sized up Little Jin with a meaningful smile on his thin lips and said indifferently.\n“It’s alright. Children can’t tell right from wrong. Everything they say is unintentional.”\n“However, he’s so young, yet he’s already speculating and slandering others. It seems like he lacks parental supervision. As his mother, you should pay more attention.”\nHis tone was calm and even gentle, but Little Jin’s mother was trembling in fear.\nHe… he said that she had failed her duty as a parent!\nShe grabbed Little Jin and roared with a ferocious expression.\n“Did you hear that?! Don’t spout nonsense! In the future, you must control your mouth and stop slandering others, understand? Otherwise, I won’t buy you any more toys!”\nLittle Jin had never been scolded in public before. Sensing the gazes of the children around him, he felt embarrassed and shielded his eyes with his arms. He immediately broke down and wailed.\nQiu Xingyu was somewhat frightened. She hid behind Qiu Tong’s back and covered her eyes with her small hands, peeping through them to see the situation.\nShe tugged at Qiu Tong’s sleeve and said softly, “Auntie is so angry, but she has never scolded Little Jin in the past.”\nQiu Tong stroked the top of her head comfortingly, her gaze landing on Song Yan.",

      "content": "Chapter 98: Purchasing The Formula\n“Boohoo… I was in the wrong…”\nLittle Jin had no choice but to apologize to Qiu Tong and the three children.\nThe gazes of the kindergarten parents changed as they looked at the Qiu family. They turned away and kept silent. How could they dare to spout any more nonsense?\nSong Yan lazily raised his finger and rubbed his forehead. He said casually, “Children have to be controlled when they make mistakes, but scolding alone is useless. You have to educate them.”\n“What would happen if he bears a grudge against other children in the kindergarten in the future?”\nLittle Jin’s mother understood his hint and pulled Little Jin to his feet. She promised him, “Definitely not! Don’t worry… I will definitely educate him well!”\nQiu Tong stared at Song Yan. She had a nagging feeling that he was different today.\nFurthermore, Chief Officer Fang had clearly said that the guest presenter for the award ceremony did not have the surname Song, but it was still Song Yan who came to the kindergarten. What went wrong?\nQiu Tong could sense an unfamiliar aura from the man before her. Was she being too sensitive?\nSong Yan sensed Qiu Tong’s probing gaze. He immediately withdrew the mischievous smile on his face and switched to his indifferent expression. He tugged at his tie and pursed his thin lips into a straight line as he looked ahead…\nQiu Tong heaved a sigh of relief when she saw that familiar expression and mannerisms, dispelling her suspicions.\nThis was obviously the person she was familiar with.\nPerhaps the strange environment in the kindergarten had caused him to behave abnormally. Qiu Tong found an explanation for Song Yan’s abnormal behavior.\nHowever, Qiu Tong did not know that imitating Jin Yang was very simple for Song Yan. He had often used this trick to cheat his parents and gain more care and concern for him.\nEven his biological parents could not differentiate between him and Jin Yang, much less Qiu Tong?\nAt the thought of this, Song Yan gritted his teeth in self-deprecation. Annoyance pricked his heart. As soon as the award ceremony ended, he looked at Qiu Tong and walked out of the kindergarten.\nMayor Shen personally escorted him out before returning to the auditorium. He looked at Qiu Tong and rubbed his hands together, speaking in an extremely genial tone.\n“Miss Qiu, your son’s locust pesticide is very successful and we are very interested in it. Can you sell us the formula?”\n“We will mass-produce it. If you want, we can pay you a patent fee.”\nQiu Tong was a little surprised, but she quickly lowered her eyes to look at Qiu Xingyuan and said, “He was the one who developed the locust pesticide. You should be asking Xingyuan for his opinion, not mine…”\nQiu Xingyuan looked up at Qiu Tong in astonishment.\nShe was giving him the authority?!\nQiu Tong smiled and nodded encouragingly. “Mommy respects your opinions.”\nEven though they were young children, they also had the right to decide upon things that belonged to them!\nQiu Tong’s respect and support for Qiu Xingyuan made his heart tremble. He clenched his small fists and nodded in agreement.\nMayor Shen nodded and squatted down to say to Qiu Xingyuan, “We have a budget of $15,000 to purchase the locust pesticide formula. What do you think?”\n“If you’re not satisfied, I can discuss with my superior about increasing the fee…”\nThe high budget amount exceeded Qiu Tong’s expectations. It also shocked the other parents who had stopped to watch the commotion.\nThey really did not expect the Qiu family children to be so capable. They were able to earn money even though they were still in kindergarten. And it was such a huge sum of money!\nThey suddenly felt that the certificates in their hands were not good enough!\n“Look, compared to this kind of patent fee, what’s so great about a computer award?”\n“Earlier, Little Jin’s family looked down on the children of the Qiu family. If we had children as obedient and adorable as those from the Qiu family, we would be able to smile even in our dreams. Little Jin usually only knows to brag and bully female classmates in kindergarten. He deserves to be scolded!”\nLittle Jin’s mother was utterly embarrassed by the whispers of the other parents. She felt very ashamed and lost all her earlier bluster.\nQiu Xingyuan looked at Qiu Tong hesitantly and saw that she had no objections or opinions. They had reached a verbal deal with Mayor Shen for $15,000.\nMayor Shen found his secretary and signed the check on the spot, before handing it to Qiu Xingyuan.\nAt the same time, he looked up at Qiu Tong and said, “After the locust pesticide is mass-produced, the Qiu family can also sell it on the market. The profits will be yours…”\n“This is part of the official mandate. I’ll send you the business contract soon.”\nAs soon as these words were uttered, the surrounding people started discussing like crazy. They all knew how profitable pharmaceuticals were on the market, and how rare it was to have an official mandate to sell.\nAt the thought of this, the parents looked at Qiu Tong with admiration and envy.",

      "content": "Chapter 99: Send You Home\nUnder the envious gazes of the parents, Qiu Tong led the three children out of the kindergarten.\nQiu Xingyuan gripped the check tightly. After a moment of hesitation, he awkwardly raised his hand and shoved it into Qiu Tong’s hand.\nQiu Tong looked at him in surprise and was about to ask why when she saw him walk to the side of the road. He said with a cold face, “I’m still young and it’s very dangerous to hold on to this sum of money. What if I meet someone like Yu Ge who steals my money?”\n“I’ll let you keep this check for me for the time being. I am not giving it to you!”\n“You can use it for the time being, but when the need arises, I’ll get it back from you…”\nQiu Xingyuan turned his face away from her.\nQiu Tong suppressed her laughter and rubbed his head. She hugged him and said softly, “Mommy understands. Thank you!”\nShe understood that he was afraid that she did not have money. It was just that he was not good at expressing his feelings for her.\nQiu Tong could wait. She could wait for the three children to fully trust and depend on her…\nShe believed that that day would come soon!\nTaking advantage of Qiu Xingyuan’s daze, she suddenly leaned over and kissed his cheek!\nQiu Xingyuan widened his eyes in shock and wanted to push Qiu Tong away, but he could not. He could only rub his face in disdain, frowning in humiliation.\nQiu Xingyu looked at her mother and brother and rushed over to hug Qiu Tong’s neck.\n“Little Yu wants a kiss too! Mommy can’t be biased!”\nQiu Tong kissed her tenderly and brought Qiu Xingqiao over as well. Everyone was rewarded with a kiss!\nThe family of four was laughing and playing when Song Yan’s black Mercedes slowly stopped in front of them.\nQiu Tong held the three kids warily and assumed a defensive stance. When Song Yan rolled down the car window, she relaxed a little. “You haven’t left?”\nSong Yan smiled, narrowed his eyes and tilted his head. “I was waiting for you guys. Let me send you home!”\nQiu Tong was very familiar with Song Yan, so she herded the children in.\nSong Yan gripped the steering wheel. Qiu Tong was surprised to see no sign of Shao An in the car. She asked in confusion, “You are by yourself? Alone?”\n“Yes, Shao An has something to do. It’s not convenient to talk about it.”\nSong Yan replied perfunctorily.\nQiu Tong recalled how those two men usually interacted with each other and nodded. She did not probe further. She rolled down the window and let the warm wind blow against her face. She was very relaxed.\nCompared to her, the three children looked at Song Yan as if they were looking at an enemy. Their small faces were scrunched up!\nTheir mother had not told him their home address, but Song Yan seemed to have no problem with the route. He knew where their home was!\nHe seemed to be very familiar with their mother?\nMommy would never be so relaxed in front of anyone!\nThey must have met many times before!\nWere they going to have a stepfather soon?\nQiu Xingyu looked at Qiu Xingyuan nervously. Qiu Xingyuan pursed his lips and stole a glance at Qiu Tong’s face, feeling rather worried.\nIf she really found a man outside, would she abandon them?\nAt the instigation of the triplets, Qiu Xingqiao cleared his throat and said, “Who are you? Why were you waiting for Mommy?”\n“What’s your relationship with Mommy? How long have you known each other? How did you meet?”\nHe was an impatient person and did not hold back his curiosity.\nQiu Tong raised an eyebrow and burst out laughing.\nWere these children interrogating a criminal?\nSong Yan tapped his fingers on the steering wheel as he waited for the traffic light to turn green. Through the rearview mirror, he stared at the three children with their different expressions. If he wanted to drive Jin Yang crazy, he could start by capturing these children!\nAnd he was more skilled at strategizing against children than that brother of his!\nHe raised his eyebrows and replied gently, “I’ve known your Mommy for a period of time.”\n“We met by chance.”\nSong Yan casually omitted several key details, without arousing Qiu Tong’s suspicion.\nDuring his time outside, he had already conducted a thorough investigation. Qiu Tong was a single mother and no one around knew who the children’s father was.\nEven the children themselves did not know.\nIn other words… Jin Yang did not know of the existence of these children!\n“Our relationship…”\nAt this point, Song Yan turned his head suggestively to look at Qiu Tong and asked, “Do you want to be like other children, having a father who can play football with you on holidays or accompany you to the amusement park?”\nQiu Tong was surprised by his question.\nQiu Xingyuan sneered at Song Yan. He knew that this man was not harboring any good intentions!\nBefore Qiu Xingqiao and Qiu Xingyu could react, he said coldly, “Our father is already dead! We don’t need a father!”\nSong Yan stepped on the accelerator and the car drove very steadily. He could tell that the children were very obedient to Qiu Xingyuan. He raised his eyebrows and asked, “What if he’s not dead?”",

We’re also very adorable!”\n“But I advise Uncle not to go around acknowledging random children!”\n“Previously, there was a scumbag called Yu Ge who wanted to be our father and even tried to extort money from us. He’s currently locked up in jail!”\n“Uncle has such a high status. You don’t want to end up like him, right?”\nQiu Xingyu lifted her chin proudly and threatened him. She then secretly high-fived Qiu Xingyuan to celebrate.\n“…”\nSong Yan was speechless. He sent them home in silence.\nAt the villa, Qiu Tong went to the bathroom to take a bath.\nThe three children looked at each other and ran to Qiu Xingyuan’s room. They closed the door and their little heads crowded together as they sat cross-legged on the carpet. The thought of Song Yan put them on high alert!\n“Mommy really seems to want a boyfriend… she appears to be very close to that uncle today. It’s very likely that their relationship will develop further.”\n“We are already grown up. A beautiful lady like Mommy would definitely have a boyfriend.”\nQiu Xingyu said in frustration.\nQiu Xingqiao and Qiu Xingyuan pursed their thin lips and kept silent. They thought of Yu Ge and were afraid that Qiu Tong would fall into the so-called love again and abandon them. Wouldn’t they become pitiful children again?\nQiu Xingyuan seemed to have made an important decision. “She wants to find a man, but I don’t believe in her taste.”\n“Why don’t we help her find a man instead? We can help her check those men out!”\nQiu Xingqiao nodded vigorously in agreement. The children once again conspired to marry off Qiu Tong. They even managed to come up with a concrete plan and countermeasures. All the way till it was late into night, they were still gathered together in high spirits…\nQiu Tong suddenly sneezed.\nShe rubbed her nose with her hands, feeling as if someone was plotting against her. Her back felt cold!\n…\nOver the weekend, Qiu Tong brought the three children and Ye Luan to the market to sell the locust pesticide.\nThey passed by a shop selling sugarcakes. Little Yu stared at the white and sticky sugarcakes, unable to move. She licked her lips and swallowed hard!\nQiu Tong immediately bought a few for them to share!\nQiu Xingyuan opened his mouth to take a big bite, but then saw that Qiu Tong didn’t have any cake. He thought that she didn’t buy any for herself because she wanted to save money. He cleared his throat and took a small bite, before awkwardly raising his hand.\n“I don’t like sweet things. Here, have some!”\nQiu Tong, “?”\nShe smiled and pushed the sweetcake back. “Only children love sweet things. Mommy doesn’t.”\nQiu Xingyuan turned his head in a huff and took a big angry bite of the sweetcake, not saying another word.\nHumph, so what if she was an adult?\nThey arranged the stall together and were soon surrounded by a huge crowd.\nThey were all reporters who had been waiting.\nThey had received news in advance that Qiu Xingyuan would be coming here to sell locust pesticide. When they saw the family of four, they rushed over with their cameras and microphones to interview Qiu Xingyuan, in order to get first-hand information about this prodigy.\n“Little boy, can I interview you? How did you develop the locust pesticide at such a young age?”\n“Have you made similar attempts before? Where did you learn this knowledge?”\n“Ms. Qiu, do you think your children are considered geniuses?”\nQiu Xingyuan was bombarded by a barrage of questions. He answered them seriously.\nQiu Xingyuan pursed his lips when he thought of the marriage plan for their mother, which he and his siblings came up with yesterday.\nWasn’t this the best opportunity?\nIf a television station helped them to advertise and promote Qiu Tong…\nAt the thought of this, Qiu Xingyuan took the initiative to hold Qiu Tong’s hand so that the camera could focus on her face. He praised her as if his mouth was coated with honey. “The only reason I can have my current accomplishments is because Mommy has always encouraged me and helped me a lot…”\n“Yes! Our mommy is very beautiful and can cook. Her character is also very… gentle! Her children are also very obedient!”\nQiu Xingyu chimed in to promote Qiu Tong. Her face was flushed red and adorable.\nShe highlighted the important points. “Mommy is single now. We welcome eligible bachelors to contact us! However, you have to go through us first!”\nThe three children announced Qiu Tong’s availability for marriage in public. Qiu Tong and the reporters were stunned!\nThis… this was a live interview!\nThe live broadcast footage spread to several television stations’ afternoon news. Even high-ranking officials in the capital saw it.\nThe president’s secretary saw the faces of Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao in the news interview. He spat out the hot tea he had just drunk and his face turned pale.\n“Why do these children look exactly like the president?!”\n“This won’t do… I have to tell the president immediately!”",

The president’s secretary ran in anxiously and shouted, “President, something’s wrong!”\nShao An immediately took out his gun and stood in front of Jin Yang. Jin Yang stared at him with a frown and said coldly, “It better be something very important…”\nThe president’s secretary was so frightened that he swallowed hard. He bent over and picked up the television remote control on the coffee table. He turned on the television and a live broadcast footage appeared on the screen.\nJin Yang was a little surprised to see Qiu Tong. He immediately looked at the secretary in confusion, as if asking, “So?”\n“Mr. President, your children are helping their mother find a stepfather…!”\n“And they are doing it publicly!”\nThe camera panned to three adorable little faces. Jin Yang was stunned to see Qiu Xingyuan’s appearance. A numbing sensation spread throughout his limbs. His heart thudded violently and his legs felt like they could no longer hold the weight of his body. He placed his hands on the desk to support himself, his expression slightly solemn.\nShao An looked at the screen and added, “I told you that Miss Qiu’s children look a lot like you.”\n“I suggest you attend the award ceremony before returning to S City. You don’t need to…”\nJin Yang felt his mind go blank. Their voices seemed to come from afar and he couldn’t hear them clearly.\nHis head ached as if it had been hit by a blunt instrument. That familiar image and voice grew further and further away, until Jin Yang could no longer see it clearly.\n“Book me a plane ticket. I want to return to S City.”\nJin Yang gripped his glass and drank two large mouthfuls of ice water to calm himself down. He looked up and ordered Shao An coldly.\nThe secretary and Shao An looked at each other and felt that something was wrong!\nIf Jin Yang left the residence, all their current arrangements would be disrupted.\nAlthough the secretary understood that the president desperately wanted to see the children, he still quickly took a step forward to persuade him. “Mr. President, the situation is tense and we need you to personally oversee it…”\n“If you leave, I’m afraid it will cause chaos in the military. The enemy will find an opportunity to attack us. We might end up in a passive situation!”\n“Can we push back the matter in S City a little?”\n“I think Miss Qiu will definitely be able to take good care of the children.”\nThe secretary felt like his heart was about to leap out of his throat. He had taken the risk of being demoted to persuade Jin Yang to calm down.\nAs the president, he could not prioritize his personal affairs!\n“Leave.”\nJin Yang furrowed his brows and waved Shao An and the secretary away. He sat on the sofa and replayed the interview with Qiu Tong and the three children. Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao’s eyebrows were like mini versions of his…\nIt turned out that Qiu Tong had not said those words to curry favor with him on purpose.\nThey really looked like him!\nBut why couldn’t he remember anything about Qiu Tong?\nJin Yang tried his best to recall. The piercing pain in his temples surged again. He raised his hand to press against his rapidly beating heart and panted heavily.\n“You’re all here? Did the president see you?”\n“Are they really the president’s children?”\nJin Yang stood up. He wanted to pour two glasses of wine to calm himself down. When he reached the door, he heard sounds of discussion coming from outside.\nSeveral high-ranking officials rushed over after seeing the interview. At this moment, they were discussing the relationship between Jin Yang and Qiu Tong!\nJin Yang strode over to the door and gently swirled his wine glass. He leaned against the door and listened to their deliberately lowered voices…\n“They look too similar to the President!”\n“But our President never had a woman before. He was always busy with government affairs. How could he have an illegitimate child?”\nThe secretary asked in confusion. The other officials paused and nodded in agreement.\nThe discussion outside stopped for a while. Someone asked quietly, “Could they be Song Yan’s children?”\n“He’s the President’s twin and they look identical! But Song Yan is a Casanova and always has women around him.”\n“Those children might be Song Yan’s!”\nThe high-ranking officials seemed to have found a reasonable explanation as they left the residence together. Their voices grew increasingly distant, but Jin Yang’s expression was extremely grim.\nAlthough he had expected such a possibility…\nHowever, when Jin Yang thought of the image of Song Yan and Qiu Tong together, he felt rather vexed.",

He muttered, “Who’s cursing me behind my back?”\nHe narrowed his eyes and stared at the laboratory. When he saw the nurse coming out with the test results, he quickly adjusted his stance and went up to her.\nSong Yan flipped through the paternity test report anxiously. His gaze landed on the data on the last page. His thin lips curled into a smile.\nAs expected! The DNA was a 99% match. It was confirmed that the two samples were indeed related!\nSong Yan returned to the car and played some upbeat music. He rested his hands on the steering wheel and looked at the test report that he had tossed onto the passenger seat.\nHe recalled that while he was sending Qiu Tong and the children home, the children’s attitude was very hostile at the mention of their biological father. They also appeared very unfamiliar with him.\nCould it be that Qiu Tong had given birth to the children behind Jin Yang’s back?\nThey had never seen Jin Yang before?!\nThe smile on Song Yan’s lips grew wider and wider. His eyes shone with excitement. This was a good opportunity for him!\nIf he could win the favor of Qiu Tong and the children, he would be able to snatch what originally belonged to Jin Yang…\nHow exciting would Jin Yang’s disappointed, vexed and pained expression be?\nSong Yan could not help looking forward to it. He kept the paternity test report and stepped on the accelerator as he left the hospital.\n…\nAt the market, the reporters completed their filming and left with their cameras.\nThe originally bustling stall returned to silence. Qiu Tong continued to accompany the children in selling the locust pesticide. Although their sales volume had increased, most of the customers who stopped by were here because of Qiu Xingyuan’s reputation as a little genius. They only bought a couple of bottles and did not truly believe that there would be a locust plague.\n“Little kid, what books do you usually read? Can you tell Auntie?”\n“Auntie also has a little boy around your age. I want him to become as smart as you!”\n“Look, I will buy three bottles of locust pesticide from you, alright?”\nA woman squatted in front of Qiu Xingyuan and probed him, “Do you attend a tutoring class outside the school?”\nQiu Xingyuan swiftly packed the locust pesticide into a bag and handed it to her. He shook his head and replied, “No.”\nThe woman did not get the answer she wanted and muttered, “You’re so young but so shrewd. I bought these bottles for nothing!”\n“I didn’t manage to get any good information!”\nQiu Tong heard her muttering and saw that she was about to throw the locust pesticide into the trash can. She rushed to her side and stopped her. “Didn’t you buy the pesticide for the locust plague?”\n“Why do you care? I’ve already paid!”\n“I have the right to do whatever I want with my locust pesticide!”\nThe woman threw the items in the trash can angrily. She stuck her hands on her hips and turned to look at Qiu Xingyuan. “Who would really believe that there would be a locust plague? Everyone just wants to know how prodigies study.”\nQiu Tong frowned and looked at the crowd who had gathered to watch their argument. She raised her voice and said, “The weather has been changing recently. The crops are growing slowly. There are signs of an impending locust plague. Everyone should buy locust pesticide and use it as soon as possible.”\n“We have to prepare for a locust plague. Otherwise, when the locusts arrive and our grain supply is cut off, we will all face famine!”\nQiu Tong’s words elicited laughter from the crowd. The women waved their baskets and said sarcastically, “You really dare to say anything just to sell your locust pesticide! My family has been planting crops in the fields for generations. Why aren’t I seeing the signs that you have claimed?”\n“Let’s go, let’s go…”\nQiu Tong’s heart sank when she saw their attitude. She recalled the disasters and zombies that she had experienced in the post-apocalyptic era. She planned to stock up on food first.\nShe had to ensure the safety of the three children and herself!\nQiu Tong arrived at the largest food stall in the market. From a few steps away, she saw an old man in tattered clothes pushing a cart full of grain to the entrance of the food stall. The shop assistant picked up a few grains of rice with his hands in disdain and placed them between his teeth to chew and taste. He shook his head and said, “The quality is too poor.”\n“Even if I accept them, I can only give you this amount!”\n“You should sell whatever you can. Get lost if you don’t like my offer. Don’t disturb our business!”\nThe shop assistant shook two of his fingers. The old man bent over and put his hands together in prayer. “These are all good grains. Take a closer look. The price is really too low. I won’t even earn back the cost of the wheat. Please have mercy…”",

The straw sandals on his feet had also been patched many times. Feeling a twinge in her heart, she took the initiative to interrupt the shop assistant’s arrogant and hateful words. She placed a hand on the old man’s cart.\n“Uncle, your grain looks good. Why don’t you sell it to me?”\n“I’ll pay double their price. What do you think?”\nThe old man looked at Qiu Tong hesitantly, afraid that she was a liar.\nThe boss of the food stall, Shu Yuanwei, was hiding in the dark and watching. When he realized that Qiu Tong had come out to ruin his plans, he coughed and walked out of the shop. He threatened the old farmer fiercely. “Don’t believe her. There have been swindlers on the market recently…”\n“Swindlers? I think you’re the ones who are cheating the farmers, right?”\n“You used your monopoly power to maliciously lower the buying price from suppliers, but then turn around and raise the selling price to customers. Doesn’t your conscience prick you when you earn such ill-gotten money from others?”\nQiu Tong rebutted Shu Yuanwei angrily. The surrounding crowd pointed at him and discussed Qiu Tong’s words.\nShu Yuanwei was a little embarrassed, but he quickly put his hands on his hips and scolded Qiu Tong angrily, “What do you know?”\n“The grains that the old man pushed over are all old. New grains will be released soon. When the time comes, everyone will definitely buy fresh grains!”\n“Whoever buys these old grains will end up on the losing end!”\n“We’re businessmen, not charity workers! Do we have to buy whoever looks pitiful at a high price?”\nShu Yuanwei found a lame excuse. Qiu Tong ignored his quibbling and ridicule, taking out some money and handing it to the old farmer.\nThe old man was so excited that tears welled up in his eyes. He raised his sleeve to wipe the tears from the corners of his eyes and thanked her profusely. “You have done a good deed. You will be rewarded!”\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes and smiled gently. “You too. Go buy some new clothes and shoes.”\nWith that, she took out some brand new notes and stuffed them into the farmer’s hands.\nShu Yuanwei looked at her actions and said in disdain, “Idiot, do you really think you’re a living Buddha who saves people from suffering?”\nHe wanted to turn around and return to the shop in disdain, but one of his shop assistants ran over anxiously from the other end of the street!\nThe shop assistant pushed through the crowd and stood in front of Shu Yuanwei, raising his hand high. “Boss, look!”\n“I found this in a nearby wheat field. It’s a locust larva!”\n“There are already many larvae covering the majority of the fields! I’m afraid there will really be a locust plague!”\nHe was speaking rather loudly. When the crowd who had wanted to leave heard these words, they all stopped in their tracks and surrounded him to look at the larva in his hand.\nEveryone’s expression changed and they exchanged looks. “It is indeed a locust larva!”\nThe news that a locust plague was going to happen spread very quickly with the food stall as the starting point, causing the civilians to panic.\nShu Yuanwei suddenly rushed in front of the shop assistant. He snatched the locust larva and threw it to the ground. He crushed it and cursed, “Idiot!”\nThey could have suppressed the news of the locusts’ outbreak and secretly purchased grains to raise the price when the plague broke out, so that they could achieve high profits! But this idiot’s words had already spread, and the food stall might not be able to gain any advantage now!\nAcross the shop, the children’s business suddenly exploded.\n“Give me two bottles!”\n“Me too! I want 10 bottles!”\nNews of the locust plague spread very quickly. Many people rushed to Qiu Xingyuan’s stall to buy locust pesticide. The crowd fought over the pesticide and the bottles were rapidly sold out.\nApart from some of the more foolish civilians, most people in the city understood that it was too late to kill the larvae now that they had developed to such a stage.\nThere was no way to stop a locust plague from erupting. The only thing they could do was stock up on food!\nThe crowd quickly ran around, trying to buy grains from the farmers. The market price rapidly increased…\nThere were even some people who saw that Qiu Tong had yet to take the grain cart away, and directly offered three times the price to purchase it.\nQiu Tong raised an eyebrow at the livid Shu Yuanwei and shook her head in refusal.\n“How is it? Boss Shu, I don’t think I lost any money. I can still make a small profit.”\n“But for you, you’ve been suppressing the buying prices for the farmers and haven’t bought much grain. It would be a little difficult for you to deal with the locust plague now, right?”\nQiu Tong deliberately poured salt over Shu Yuanwei’s wounds.. The situation in the market was a slap in the face for him. He wished he could swallow his earlier words!",

He gritted his teeth and glared at her fiercely, blaming her for all his losses!\nEveryone wanted to stock up on food. When they saw Qiu Tong’s cart parked outside, they all asked her how much she was selling it for.\nThey raised the price to three times that of Qiu Tong’s earlier price.\nShu Yuanwei felt his heart bleed. Qiu Tong comforted the crowd. “These are my personal grains. Sorry, they are not for sale.”\n“But if you want to buy grains, there’s still some at the old farmer’s house. I can introduce you to him…”\nWhen Shu Yuanwei heard that his customers were about to leave, he hurriedly shouted and interrupted her. He started a rumor by saying, “Don’t listen to her!”\n“She must have known in advance that there would be a locust plague. Otherwise, why would she let her children sell locust pesticide and wantonly buy up old grains?”\n“Think about it carefully. Who would research locust pesticide for no reason?”\n“In the past few years, the harvests have been very good. There’s no shortage in the food market at all! How did she manage to predict the locust plague in advance?”\nWhen everyone heard Shu Yuanwei’s words, they took a few wavering steps back and maintained a distance from Qiu Tong, as if she was a jinx.\nShu Yuanwei immediately rejoiced and continued to slander Qiu Tong. He pointed at her and said, “She might be the one who created the locust larvae!”\n“She is deliberately destroying the grain fields to cause a disaster. She then hoarded food at a low price to sell at a huge profit!”\n“This woman is too vicious! Don’t be fooled by her!”\nShu Yuanwei’s words became increasingly outrageous. He even wanted to instigate the crowd to attack her.\nQiu Tong looked at his arrogant manner and rotated her wrist indifferently. She asked in a soft voice, “Did you buy insurance?”\nShu Yuanwei was stunned for a moment. He instinctively nodded and replied, “Of course.”\nA smile flashed across Qiu Tong’s eyes as she approached Shu Yuanwei at an extremely fast speed. She grabbed his collar and threw him out. The surrounding crowd was so frightened that they took a few steps back, leaving an empty space.\nShu Yuanwei’s eyes were pitch-black. He was sprawled on the ground with his face facing down. He opened his mouth to curse Qiu Tong. But as he staggered to get up, he saw Qiu Tong’s fist coming at him.\n“Thump!”\nShu Yuanwei’s head vibrated painfully. He squatted on the ground with his dark eyes and covered his head as he crouched.\nQiu Tong looked at his sorry state and took out a handkerchief in disdain to wipe the bloodstains on her fingertips. “Boss Shu bought insurance in advance.”\n“He must have been asking for a beating today to cheat his insurance, right?”\nShe was using Shu Yuanwei’s own words against him. His face was ashen, but he could not think of anything to refute.\nQiu Tong did this to point out the error of Shu Yuanwei’s claims. Fortunately, the surrounding people also understood her intentions. They all looked at Shu Yuanwei’s tragic state and burst out laughing.\nShu Yuanwei was so embarrassed that his scalp went numb and his entire body ached.\nHe propped himself up on the ground, his eyes filled with hatred. He pointed at Qiu Tong and warned, “Don’t run if you have the guts!”\n“I have connections with the police. I can let you spend the rest of your life in prison!”\n“You have to pay the price for what you’ve done!”\nShu Yuanwei took out his phone and called the police. Qiu Tong stood calmly in place and settled the cart of food, waiting for the police officers to arrive.\nThe police officer roughly understood the situation at the scene and brought both parties to the police station to make a statement.\nQiu Tong did not resist. Instead, she sat on the bench at the police station and waited for the proceedings.\nShu Yuanwei sneered at her and threatened in a low voice, “Just you wait!”\nAs soon as he finished speaking, Shu Yuanwei saw Chief Officer Fang walking over from afar. He hurriedly took the initiative to go up to him and politely took out two cigarettes. “You’re so busy, yet I am still troubling you with this. I’m really sorry!”\n“I heard that Chief Officer Fang’s daughter did well in her exams? I managed to find two bottles of good wine. I’ll definitely visit her personally to celebrate!”\nShu Yuanwei pretended to be familiar with Chief Officer Fang. Seeing him take the cigarette, he was relieved.\n“Chief Officer Fang, look…”\n“This woman committed a crime. She acted with the intent of harming another person. I’m covered in injuries. I can go to the hospital for an injury report!”\n“Please punish her severely! Teach her a lesson!”",

She looked around lazily.\nShu Yuanwei had a close relationship with Chief Officer Fang. Every few months, he would secretly send a few gifts to Chief Officer Fang’s family in exchange for his protection.\nWhen Chief Officer Fang heard Shu Yuanwei’s accusation, he wanted to back him up. However, when his gaze landed on Qiu Tong, he stopped in shock and looked flustered.\nQiu Tong sensed his gaze and smiled with interest. She gave him a slight nod.\nShu Yuanwei noticed the slightly tense air between Qiu Tong and Chief Officer Fang. However, he foolishly thought that it was because Qiu Tong was afraid of Chief Officer Fang, which was why she was smiling.\n“Do you see this? This is Chief Officer Fang from the police station. He is going to personally interrogate you. I won’t let go of this matter so easily!”\n“You look pitiful and you have to support your children. Why don’t we discuss a private settlement?”\n“As long as you agree to kneel down and apologize to me, as well as pay $15,000 to compensate for my hospitalization treatment and emotional trauma! I can consider letting you off. Otherwise, just wait to be jailed! Don’t even think about coming out for the rest of your life!”\nShu Yuanwei pointed in Qiu Tong’s direction and spoke arrogantly with Chief Officer Fang backing him. He did not notice that Chief Officer Fang’s face had turned pale.\nQiu Tong slowly stood up and ignored him. She stared at Chief Officer Fang coldly and asked, “Oh? Is that so?”\nThe dominant tone in her words made Chief Officer Fang’s legs go weak. He immediately shook his head and said, “No!”\n“The police will definitely follow the rules and regulations. They won’t play favorites!”\n“Shu Yuanwei, you were the one who provoked Ms. Qiu first. Her actions were in self-defense. There was no mistake.”\n“Leave the police station quickly and stop looking for me!”\nChief Officer Fang quickly tried to put some distance between him and Shu Yuanwei. He looked at Qiu Tong politely and ingratiatingly. “I’ll have some police officers to send you and the children back!”\nShu Yuanwei was once again slapped in the face. He did not expect Chief Officer Fang to favor Qiu Tong!\nQiu Tong would never give Chief Officer Fang money or gifts. She must have received his protection because they were romantically involved!\nShu Yuanwei quietly came up with this conjecture. In his shock, he pointed at Qiu Tong and said, “I didn’t expect you to hook up with Chief Officer Fang!’ You’re already the mother of three children, yet you’re still so shameless!”\n“I was still wondering how a woman without any background could sell locust pesticide on the market!”\n“Looks like you are sleeping around! Why don’t you name a price? I’ll also…”\nShu Yuanwei’s arrogant words shocked Chief Officer Fang so much that he wished he could cover his mouth!\nWhy was this fellow always causing trouble for him?\nChief Officer Fang looked at Qiu Tong nervously. Her expression had turned extremely grim. She raised her hand to cover Qiu Xingyu’s ears, shielding her from the vulgar accusations.\nQiu Tong looked at Qiu Xingyuan’s watery eyes and said coldly to Qiu Xingyuan, “Take your siblings over there. Don’t turn around!”\nQiu Xingyuan clenched his small fists and gritted his teeth as he glared at Shu Yuanwei.\nAt the thought of Qiu Tong’s skills, he nodded vigorously and brought Qiu Xingqiao and Qiu Xingqiao over to the wall at the side. He pointed at the list of rules tacked to the wall to distract them.\nQiu Tong rushed in front of Shu Yuanwei and kicked his head. His heavy body fell to the ground with a thud.\nChief Officer Fang could see Qiu Tong’s anger and took out his handcuffs in cooperation. He detained Shu Yuanwei and threw a few punches at his abdomen.\n“Ms. Qiu, please come over and make a statement.”\n“Shu Yuanwei is suspected of insulting the police and causing trouble. We will punish him with administrative detention. Are you satisfied?”\nChief Officer Fang subserviently accompanied Qiu Tong to the interrogation room. He even thoughtfully poured her a cup of warm tea and spoke to her in a soft voice.\nQiu Tong cooperated with his questions and signed her name on the statement. After leaving the interrogation room, she wanted to bring the children home, but she bumped into Shu Xian, who had come to bail Shu Yuanwei. He generously offered his bail and waited for the police to approve the bail process.\nLin Shan was wearing a revealing tight dress and a vulgar fur coat. She held onto Shu Xian’s arm and whispered sweetly in his ear.\nQiu Tong sized them up but she couldn’t be bothered with them. She just wanted to leave quietly. However, Lin Shan took the initiative to provoke her. “Aiyo, some women really have to go to the police station once every few days!”\n“I wonder what kind of criminal activity she is involved in? So what if she’s beautiful?”\n“She’s still available for sale!”",

      "content": "Chapter 106: Robbery On The Way Home\nQiu Xingqiao’s pitch-black eyes revealed his uncontrollable anger. He clenched his fists tightly, wanting to break free from Qiu Tong’s restraint like a fierce little beast.\n“Let go of me! I’m going to tear her apart…”\nQiu Xingqiao’s eyes were bloodshot as he flailed around. No matter what Qiu Tong had done to them before, she was still their mother!\nNo one could scold or slander her!\nQiu Tong was touched. She hugged Qiu Xingqiao and comforted them gently. “If you encounter a stray dog on the street and it tries to bite you.”\n“Do you bite back? Just let it bark as much as it wants!”\nQiu Tong was being deliberately sarcastic, causing Lin Shan’s face to turn ashen. She wanted to retort, but she sensed Shu Xian’s impatient gaze and could only swallow her words. Her hatred for Qiu Tong intensified.\nQiu Tong passed by Lin Shan with the three children. Taking advantage of her distraction, she quietly stretched out her leg and tripped Lin Shan, causing her to stumble and nearly fall.\nLin Shan forgot all about maintaining her image. She turned around and pointed at Qiu Tong. “You only dare to do things in secret. Challenge me face to face if you dare…”\nQiu Tong turned a deaf ear to her provocation. She rubbed the top of Qiu Xingqiao’s head and whispered to him, “Being impulsive is not the way to solve problems.”\n“Neither is violence. We can make the smarter choice, right?”\nQiu Xingqiao nodded quickly and broke free from her arms. He ran to Qiu Xingyu’s side and held her hand. The family of four headed towards the market.\nAt the police station, Shu Xian bailed Shu Yuanwei out and helped him change into a new set of clothes. He asked, “Uncle, what happened?”\nAs he and Lin Shan looked on, Shu Yuanwei kept cursing Qiu Tong. He spat out especially nasty words and phrases. “That b*tch! I didn’t expect her to be linked to Chief Officer Fang. Not only did she steal my business, she even got me into this wretched state!”\n“I must settle my scores with her!”\n“Sooner or later, I’ll have that b*tch kowtow to me and admit her mistake. Otherwise, my surname won’t be Shu!”\nLin Shan listened to Shu Yuanwei’s words and turned to look at Chief Officer Fang, who was talking to the police officer. She silently guessed that he was the big shot that Qiu Tong had hooked up with! As long as she could gain Chief Officer Fang’s favor and snatch away Qiu Tong’s sugar daddy, everything she had would be hers!\nWhen the time came, Qiu Tong would have no choice but to obey her every whim.\nAt the thought of this, Lin Shan was secretly elated as she imagined the future. She looked at Chief Officer Fang and her fiery red lips curled up.\nQiu Tong brought the children back to the market and looked at the old farmer’s cart full of grains. She wanted to move them back herself.\n“I’ll help Mommy!”\n“Me too!”\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao pushed the cart while Qiu Xingyu sat on it, solemnly holding all the bags of grains together so that not even a grain of rice would fall off!\nQiu Tong watched as Qiu Xingyuan awkwardly shifted his gaze away, but refused to let her push the car. Her heart warmed.\nThe family of four pushed the cart into an alley not far from the grain shop. Suddenly, a few burly gangsters appeared from afar and looked at them with ferocious expressions.\nThe gangsters whistled and patted the wooden sticks in their hands. They looked at Qiu Tong and the three children and shouted in a hoarse voice, “Leave the grain behind and we’ll let you live!”\n“Don’t blame us for being ruthless. We were paid to do this!”\n“Blame yourselves for offending someone you shouldn’t have!”\nThe gangsters did not hide anything. They revealed that it was Shu Yuanwei who hired them.\nWhen Shu Yuanwei came out of the police station, he felt that things were not going well for him. He knew that Qiu Tong would definitely find a way to move the grains back, so he thought of hiring thugs to teach her a lesson.\nQiu Tong looked at them and rotated her wrist calmly. She said in a clear voice, “How long are you going to just stand there and watch?”\n“Do I have to deal with them myself?”\nKe Le and the others walked out from a corner. They scratched their heads and smiled foolishly. “Boss, we think they’re too weak.”\n“They are not worth it at all!”\nThe smile in Ke Le’s eyes faded when he turned to look at the gangsters. What replaced it was a thick murderous aura. The mercenaries surrounded the gangsters, their movements agile as their punches landed heavily upon them!\nThe gangsters had no chance of fighting back at all. They hugged their heads and fled in all directions.",

      "content": "Chapter 107: M78 Sniper Rifle\nQiu Tong watched as the hooligans fled. She turned back and stared at the cart of grains. After some thought, she asked Ke Le, “Is there any hiding place nearby?”\nKe Le pointed at the corner of the street and said, “There’s a straw shed in front. No one usually passes through it. It’s very safe!”\nQiu Tong nodded and gestured for the mercenaries to help move the cart of grains to the straw shed.\nShe sensed Ke Le’s confusion and explained softly, “All the food in the market has been snatched away…”\n“Food is the most sought after thing. What we have will definitely attract the covetous eyes of others!”\n“Not only Shu Yuanwei, there might also be others!”\nThe experience of surviving in the post-apocalyptic era made Qiu Tong realize that she could no longer openly transport the grains home. She hid the grains under some hay and patted Qiu Xingyuan’s head as she instructed, “You take care of your younger siblings, Ke Le will also protect you and the grains!”\n“Mommy will come back to move the stuff home with you guys when it gets dark!”\nWith that, Qiu Tong sped towards the black market. She planned to use the money she had to purchase some guns and ammunition.\nIt was only a matter of time before the locust plague broke out. At that time, refugees would surge through the streets and they would be extremely hungry. It was very likely that they would do something extreme and cause riots. The image of the post-apocalyptic era surfaced in Qiu Tong’s mind. She frowned and quickened her pace…\nQiu Tong was the mother of three children now. She needed a gun for self-defense and be fully prepared to deal with the danger.\n…\nIn the black market, Qiu Tong scanned every stall with her sharp eyes. She saw a few guns hidden under some fruits and asked for their price.\nBe it guns, ammunition, poison powder, or information, as long as you had enough money in your pockets, you could buy whatever you wanted in the black market.\nQiu Tong wandered through a few stalls but did not find any firearms that she liked. She was disappointed and decided to head back first.\nBefore she left, she inadvertently glanced at an inconspicuous stall in the corner and realized that there was a gun barrel peeking out from under a coarse cloth.\nIt was… a M78 sniper rifle?\nQiu Tong couldn’t hardly conceal her joy as she walked to the stall. She reached out to pick up the sniper rifle to test its accuracy, but unexpectedly, a hand appeared and grabbed the head of the sniper rifle at the same time as her. That hand looked like it was fighting her for it.\nQiu Tong frowned and saw a tall, thin man beside her. He sized her up with a look of disdain.\n“You’re a woman. If you want to protect yourself, buy some poison powder. Don’t buy firearms that you don’t know how to use.”\nYin Hai looked at her mockingly and wanted to snatch the sniper rifle away, but he realized that Qiu Tong’s grip was very strong. The two of them stood in front of the stall.\n“Do you know how to use a sniper rifle?”\n“If you buy this thing, it will be just for show. But if you’re willing to let me have it, I can give you some money…”\nQiu Tong was very disgusted by Yin Hai’s attitude of using money to suppress others. The corners of her lips curled up and her eyes turned cold as she rotated her wrist. Taking advantage of Yin Hai’s relaxed attitude, she snatched the sniper rifle. She removed the bullets and adjusted the aim.\n“There is a longitudinal groove on the surface of this M78 sniper rifle. It increases the shooting range on the original foundation. At the same time, it also disperses heat better.”\n“The trigger pull is 3.3 pounds which makes the shooting smooth and easy. Mercenaries from overseas often use this type of sniper rifle.”\n“However, the greatest advantage of this sniper rifle is that its barrel has been modified. Not only can it load more bullets, it can also be modified into a submachine gun with a short range and high frequency when necessary. How about that? Are you still questioning if I know how to use it?”\nQiu Tong’s voice was soft as she described the gun. Yin Hai’s pupils dilated in shock. He could not believe that a woman knew so much about the M78 sniper rifle.\n“Don’t look down on any people you don’t know. Otherwise… you might end up losing your life to them!”\nQiu Tong’s voice held a warning tone. As soon as she finished speaking, she raised the sniper rifle and aimed it at the space between Yin Hai’s brows. She gently placed her finger on the trigger, ready to take his life at any moment.\nQiu Tong’s cold eyes appeared behind the weapon’s eyepiece. Yin Hai was so scared he did not dare to move.\nThe atmosphere was so tense that no one dared to breathe. In the Mercedes-Benz car parked in front of the black market, Song Yan had been staring at Qiu Tong and Yin Hai. It was only now that he pushed open the door and walked out.\nHe met Qiu Tong’s gaze and shouted, “Yin Hai! Move away!”",

      "content": "Chapter 108: Coincidental Encounter in the Black Market\nQiu Tong saw Song Yan appear in the black market. She raised her eyebrows in surprise and put down the sniper rifle.\nYin Hai respectfully retreated to Song Yan’s left side. He stood straight and reported to him with a vexed expression, “I’m sorry, I couldn’t help you get that M78 sniper rifle. Please punish me, I hold full responsibility.”\nSong Yan waved his hand, indicating for Yin Hai to be quiet and not say anything else. He stared at Qiu Tong with interest.\nThis woman actually had some understanding of firearms and was skilled at using them. Could this be the reason why she could attract Jin Yang?\nSong Yan’s interest in Qiu Tong deepened. He mimicked Jin Yang’s unique cold tone and said, “I didn’t expect you to like sniper rifles too?”\n“I appreciate all fine things.”\nQiu Tong sized up Yin Hai with a smile and said bluntly, “Your new bodyguard is not as smart as Shao An.”\n“If he underestimates his opponent like this, he might easily fall for schemes. I advise you to add a few more guards so that you can ensure your safety.”\nQiu Tong’s kind reminder stunned Yin Hai for a moment. He hated it when others compared him to Shao An, so he instinctively retorted, “You have got it wrong.”\n“Shao An is the Presi…” Before he could finish his sentence, Song Yan stopped Yin Hai with a look. He immediately shut up and stood behind with his head lowered.\nSong Yan shrugged and explained half-heartedly, “Shao An has other tasks to do.”\nQiu Tong nodded slightly, not interested in pursuing their current situation.\nShe just wanted to end the small talk as soon as possible and buy a batch of firearms before going back to find Qiu Xingyuan and the rest to carry the grains back!\nQiu Tong looked up at the darkening sky, a hint of impatience on her face.\nSong Yan shifted his gaze and stood in front of Qiu Tong. He deliberately put on a troubled expression as he stared at the sniper rifle in her hand. “I will definitely let you have it now that I know that you like it. But…”\n“As you can see, public security has been very chaotic recently. I came to the black market to buy a gun for self-defense.”\n“If I let you have this sniper rifle, I will be in a dangerous situation. Shao An is away carrying out other missions… and you’ve seen Yin Hai’s skills!”\n“I’m afraid that if someone tries to attack me, Yin Hai wouldn’t be able to detect it immediately…”\nSong Yan said this right in front of Yin Hai. But the latter did not dare to speak up or even show any anger. He could only endure it and continue to listen to Song Yan coaxing Qiu Tong.\nQiu Tong frowned and narrowed her eyes warily. “So, you still want to snatch this M78 from me?”\nSong Yan stuck one hand in his pocket and waved his hand in denial. “I just wanted to ask you if you could take me in for a night?”\nHe saw surprise in Qiu Tong’s eyes. He added, “It’s very dangerous for me to be outside.”\n“I’ll give you this gun in exchange for protecting me for a night. What do you think? It should be a fair and cost-effective deal, right?”\nYin Hai did not expect Song Yan to make such an outrageous request. He looked at Qiu Tong in shock, quietly speculating about their relationship.\nQiu Tong pondered deeply.\nIt was true that she and Yin Hai had their eyes on this sniper rifle at the same time. She was quite well-acquainted with Song Yan, and taking him in for a night was actually not too difficult nor outrageous.\nQiu Tong pointed at Yin Hai and asked, “Is he going to stay with us too?”\nSong Yan turned to look at him. He smiled and said teasingly, “I will be living in your house and will be under your rules. Of course, I’ll follow your arrangements. If you find it inconvenient, you can also let him stay outside to guard the house. It’s fine.”\nQiu Tong counted the rooms in the villa. There were still a few empty rooms. She took out some money and bought a few sniper rifles and two boxes of bullets. “Let’s go.”\nSong Yan drove Qiu Tong to the straw shed in the alley. As soon as she got out of the car, Qiu Xingyu ran over and hugged her waist. She said coquettishly, “Mommy, why are you back so late? It’s already dark!”\nQiu Tong rubbed the top of her head and called Ke Le to move all the grains into Song Yan’s trunk.\nQiu Xingyuan pursed his thin lips and looked at Song Yan with hostility. The children also stood in a row as if they were facing a formidable enemy. They frowned and said, “Why is this uncle with Mommy?”\nQiu Tong looked at Song Yan and explained calmly, “This uncle will be staying at our house for tonight.”\n“What?!”\nQiu Xingqiao cried out in alarm, his eyes filled with disbelief.\nQiu Xingyuan looked at Qiu Tong with disappointment. Had this woman fallen into the river of love again and become a lovesick fool?",

      "content": "Chapter 109: Prank\nThe night was dark. Qiu Tong instructed Ke Le and the mercenaries to carry the grains.\nSong Yan saw her carrying a few bags of grains on her own. She was wiping the sweat off her face with her hand. His heart skipped a beat as he walked to her side to help.\nQiu Tong looked at him in surprise, then nodded slightly to express her gratitude.\nQiu Xingyuan pursed his thin lips, his small face filled with coldness as he stared at their backs, which looked exceptionally intimate together. He frowned as he observed.\nQiu Xingqiao pricked up his ears, wanting to eavesdrop on what Song Yan was saying to Qiu Tong. He quietly approached but accidentally stepped on a dead branch on the ground. The noise attracted Qiu Tong’s attention. She instinctively turned around and asked, “What’s wrong?”\n“Stay there obediently and don’t move around!”\nQiu Tong instructed. When she saw Song Yan lifting a few bags of grains, she rushed over to help him.\nQiu Xingyu pouted and tugged at Qiu Xingyuan’s sleeve uneasily. “Eldest Brother, Mommy seems to really like that uncle!”\n“What should we do? This uncle is getting so close to Mommy!”\nThe memory of Yu Ge remained like a shadow in the hearts of the children!\nQiu Xingyuan did not believe that Qiu Tong would choose her children over her boyfriend. His eyes flickered as he summoned Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu.\nThe three children gathered their heads together and secretly discussed their plan…\nThey had to chase Song Yan away!\n…\nAt the villa, Qiu Tong placed the grains in the warehouse and brought Song Yan to the living room.\nShe turned around and saw Ke Le and the mercenaries sitting on the floor, exhausted from carrying the bags. She opened the refrigerator and rummaged through the simple ingredients. “Take a break. I’ll make something to eat!”\nSong Yan hung his jacket on the clothes rack by the entrance and walked to the kitchen door. He asked, “Do you need my help?”\nQiu Tong shook her head and quickly heated up some oil. She pointed at the living room and said, “You can rest.”\n“It’s safe here. Ke Le and Yin Hai are guarding outside. Don’t worry.”\nSong Yan smiled faintly and returned to the living room to sit on the sofa. His gaze landed on the children whispering in the corner.\nQiu Xingyu stood on her tiptoes and picked up the box of biscuits. Trying to cover her actions with her small body, she clumsily pried open two halves of a biscuit.\nQiu Xingyuan rummaged through some cupboards and found some hot mustard. He squeezed out a long strip and smeared it on the biscuit before putting the two halves back together again.\nHmph! This would definitely make him cry!\nQiu Xingqiao stared at Song Yan with burning eyes. He clenched his small fists and muttered, “He better leave on his own!”\nQiu Xingyu walked over to Song Yan with small steps, her eyes fixed on the “mustard bomb”. She held out the box of biscuits to Song Yan. She said in a cute voice, “Uncle, I’ll treat you to some snacks…”\nSong Yan saw through everything but did not expose her. He pointed at the television which was showing a cartoon and said, “Thank you.”\n“Why don’t you sit here and we can eat together?”\nQiu Xingyu did not expect him to say that. Stunned, she turned around to look at her brother for help.\nSong Yan took advantage of her distracted state to exchange the biscuits. He picked up one of the normal biscuits and opened his mouth to eat it.\nQiu Xingqiao did not see his actions but walked over to Song Yan expectantly.\nHe was already prepared to laugh at Song Yan’s pathetic state and embarrass him in front of Qiu Tong!\nBut after waiting for two minutes, there was nothing unusual with Song Yan.\nQiu Xingyu walked to Qiu Xingyu’s side in confusion. He tentatively picked up a biscuit and placed it in his mouth…\nWhat happened? They clearly put the mustard inside!\nSong Yan supported his chin with his fingers and watched with interest as Qiu Xingqiao picked up the biscuit. The smile on his lips widened.\n“Ah!!”\nQiu Xingqiao’s expression changed. The mustard was so spicy that his tongue went numb. He covered his mouth and searched for milk or ice water in the living room.\nSong Yan pretended to be concerned and asked, “Are you alright?”\nHe had stopped playing such lousy pranks since he was young!\nThese children wanted to play pranks on him? They were still too inexperienced!\nQiu Xingyuan shielded Qiu Xingqiao by his side and glared at Song Yan with furrowed brows. The two of them faced off.\nQiu Tong heard sounds in the kitchen and stuck her head out to ask, “What’s wrong?”\n“Nothing!”\n“We’re playing a game…”\nQiu Xingyuan and Song Yan answered at the same time. Qiu Tong was a little puzzled and called everyone to the dining room. “Let’s eat!”",

However, Song Yan acted as if nothing had happened and took the initiative to pick up two small ribs and place them in Qiu Tong’s bowl.\nSong Yan looked at Qiu Tong tenderly and said affectionately, “You’ve worked hard today. Eat more.”\nThe three children stared at the two ribs in shock!’\nHe actually wanted to use this method to win over Mommy?!\nQiu Xingyuan immediately put down his chopsticks. Little Yu pondered for a moment before kicking Qiu Xingqiao under the dining table. She picked up two pork slices and piled them in Qiu Tong’s bowl. “Mommy!”\n“You usually like this type of meat the most. Try it!”\nQiu Xingqiao understood her intention. He picked up the entire dish and poured everything into Qiu Tong’s bowl. “Mommy, eat more!”\nQiu Tong looked grimly at her rice bowl which was piled with food.\nThe children’s sudden love for her was a little intense. She could not handle it!\nSong Yan looked at the children in amusement. They seemed to be very possessive of Qiu Tong.\nQiu Tong buried her head in her rice, acutely sensing that the surrounding atmosphere was a little off.\nOn the television screen in the living room, the cartoon ended and the news segment was replaying a reel where Jin Yang was answering the reporters’ questions…\nQiu Tong heard a familiar voice and turned to look at the man standing in front of the camera in a suit, as he answered the reporter’s tricky questions calmly.\nJin Yang occasionally pushed up the frames of his gold-colored glasses as he stared into the camera. He lifted his hand to loosen his bow tie.\nQiu Tong’s hand paused as she stared at him, forgetting to chew the food in her mouth.\nJin Yang’s eyes were filled with indifference. “I hope that people from all walks of life won’t spread rumors.”\nQiu Tong stared at his actions and expression, momentarily stunned and dazed. She felt her heart skip a beat.\nWhy did his mannerisms feel so familiar?\nShe seemed to have seen him somewhere before!\nSong Yan frowned and deliberately cleared his throat to snap her out of her trance.\nSong Yan waved his hand playfully in front of Qiu Tong and asked with a mischievous look, “Why? Do you think he’s not bad?”\n“Be it status or looks, he’s indeed not bad. It’s normal for you to like him…”\nSong Yan probed, but a trace of gloominess flashed across Qiu Tong’s eyes. She lowered her head and ate two mouthfuls of rice. She said in a daze, “No.”\n“The President and I belong to two different worlds. I was just paying attention to what he was saying.”\nQiu Tong thought of Song Yan and Jin Yang’s relationship and stopped talking. She didn’t want to talk about the president too much in front of him, afraid that he would be unhappy.\nFriends should be wary of each other’s emotions.\nSong Yan raised his eyebrows slightly, but he could not control the smile on his face. His eyes were filled with mockery and joy.\nJin Yang had shot himself in the foot!\nJin Yang had secretly used his name to fool women outside. Now, his trick had backfired and completely cut off all possibility between him and Qiu Tong!\nSong Yan stared at the face on the television, wishing he could immediately let Jin Yang hear Qiu Tong’s reply…\nJin Yang’s expression would definitely be very interesting!\nAs the night wore on, Qiu Xingyu and Qiu Xingqiao took the initiative to clear the dishes. The three children then sat in the living room with Song Yan.\nQiu Tong looked at them awkwardly, secretly wondering how to allocate the rooms.\n“Eldest Brother, if Uncle and Mommy live together, will we have other younger siblings?”\n“Will Mommy not care about us anymore?!”\nQiu Xingyu leaned nervously beside Qiu Xingyuan and whispered into his ear.\nThe three children thought of what might happen in the future and their expressions changed.\nNo! They had to think of a way to snatch Mommy back. They couldn’t give Song Yan any chances!\nQiu Xingyu hugged Qiu Tong’s waist and said coquettishly, “Mommy, can I sleep with you tonight?”\n“I’m afraid of the dark! I can’t sleep at night…”\nQiu Xingqiao’s expression was conflicted, but he quickly nodded stiffly in agreement. “I can hear dripping sounds in my room these few days!”\n“There might be rats somewhere! You have to help me catch them!”\nQiu Tong looked at Qiu Xingyuan in surprise, as if waiting for him to speak up too.\nQiu Xingyuan looked away and played with a button on his shirt. “I can sleep in the same room with you too.”\nWhat an unexpected turn of events!\nQiu Tong tilted her head and thought to herself, The children usually kept their distance from her, but now, they were asking to sleep in the same room with her?\nThis change was a little too sudden!",

She pointed at a bedroom indicating that he should sleep there tonight. “If you need anything, you can look for me anytime.”\nSong Yan nodded and bid her goodnight before gently pushing open the bedroom door.\nIn the room, two small night lamps emitted a faint yellow light. There were a few furry dolls on the bed.\nQiu Xingyuan’s medal and certificate from the kindergarten were framed and hung in the most conspicuous place.\nAlthough the room was not very spacious, it was filled with a warm atmosphere.\nSong Yan was suddenly vexed. He thought of the possibility that Jin Yang would have such a blissful family life, and a desire to destroy everything arose in his heart. He took out an item the size of a button from his pocket and casually stuck it in a corner, his eyes dark.\nClick—\nSong Yan pushed open the door to the villa. Yin Hai was already waiting outside. He turned his head and stared at the lights in the villa before leaving without looking back.\nThe next morning, Qiu Tong came out of her room rubbing her sleepy eyes and saw a stack of cash on the coffee table in the living room.\nShe walked closer in surprise and saw the note beside the stack of cash. She looked at Song Yan’s slightly illegible handwriting. “Thank you for taking me in.”\nHe was so polite!\nQiu Tong kept the cash. Hearing hurried footsteps, she turned around and saw Qiu Xingyuan running out of the room in his pajamas.\nWorry and anxiety flashed across his eyes. When he saw Qiu Tong’s figure, Qiu Xingyuan heaved a sigh of relief.\nThis woman didn’t leave with Song Yan?\nThe two of them stood facing each other. Qiu Tong was about to ask if he was hungry when she heard the doorbell ring.\nQiu Tong pushed open the door and saw Mayor Shen standing outside with a gift box in both hands. He looked a little uneasy. “Miss Qiu, I’m sorry to disturb you!”\n“It’s alright, come in and talk.”\nQiu Tong was slightly surprised and turned to let Mayor Shen into the house. She poured him a cup of warm tea and asked curiously, “What’s the matter?”\nMayor Shen stole a glance at Qiu Xingyuan, who was sitting on the sofa. He rubbed his teacup nervously with his fingers and stammered, “You should know that the locusts in the nearby wheat fields are already showing signs of increasing exponentially. The number of locusts in every wheat field is already reaching an uncontrollable level!”\n“Our factory is rushing to produce locust pesticide.”\n“But the staff we hired at the last minute are not very skilled in mixing the chemicals. I would like to invite Miss Qiu to bring Qiu Xingyuan to the factory to guide them.”\n“This might help us and the farmers get rid of the locust plague as soon as possible.”\nQiu Tong looked at Qiu Xingyuan. Since he was the one being invited to the factory, she naturally had to seek his opinion.\nQiu Xingyuan pursed his thin lips like a little adult. This was the first time he had developed the locust pesticide, so he also wanted to see how the factory produced it. He nodded. “Sure. I’ll go with you…”\n“Thank you!”\nMayor Shen was very courteous. He immediately instructed the driver to get ready and rushed Qiu Tong and Qiu Xingyuan to the factory.\nAfter going through several rounds of disinfection, Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Tong entered the factory accompanied by Mayor Shen. They saw dozens of staff dressed in protective clothing mixing the chemicals. Their movements were not that standardized, but they were very fast.\nQiu Xingyuan walked to their side and looked at the mixing process seriously. When his gaze landed on a certain spot, he frowned and stopped the employee. He said in a clear young voice, “You didn’t mix according to the proper ratio!”\n“You can increase your speed by mixing the chemicals without measuring properly, but the effectiveness of the pesticide will be impacted!”\nThe employee lowered his head to look at Qiu Xingyuan. Although he did not think that a young child would understand these things, he still explained on behalf of Mayor Shen. “Currently, locust numbers are growing and reproducing exponentially. There’s no other way to increase our speed. We can afford to wait, but not the crops!”\n“Are we going to just sit by and watch as the farmers suffer?”\nThe employee choked as he explained to Qiu Xingyuan. Qiu Xingyuan recalled the plot of land he had passed by and lowered his eyes in thought.\nAlthough the chemicals were not being mixed to exact measurements, and this would weaken the effects of the pesticide, as long as the dosage reached a certain level, the pesticide produced would still suppress the growth of the locusts. It should not be a major problem.\nQiu Xingyuan lowered his small hands and walked back to Mayor Shen’s side. He said calmly, “This will do.”\n“As long as the proportions of the chemical ingredients are not too far off from the recipe, you can continue to produce them according to the current process.”",

      "content": "Chapter 112: Allergic Reaction\nA few days later, the first batch of locust pesticide was prepared by the factory. Mayor Shen specially sent someone to deliver a few boxes to Qiu Tong.\nQiu Tong looked at the box seriously and recalled the difficulties that Qiu Xingyuan faced when he was developing the locust pesticide. This was his hard work.\nAs his mother, she should show her support!\nAt the thought of this, Qiu Tong asked Ke Le and the others to move a few boxes of the locust pesticide to the entrance of the kindergarten. They set up a simple stall and wrote the words “Free locust pesticide” on a board.\nThe news of the free locust pesticide spread very quickly. Many parents and others gathered at the entrance of the kindergarten.\nWhen the pharmaceutical supervisor heard the news, he quickly drove over to help Qiu Tong. In just half a day, he had already given away most of the locust pesticide.\nDing Ding Ding—\nThe kindergarten’s school bell rang. Qiu Xingyuan walked out of the school with his school bag. He was a little surprised to see Qiu Tong, but he quickly concealed his emotions. He held Qiu Xingyu’s hand and walked to Qiu Tong’s side. He muttered, “How embarrassing!”\nQiu Tong rubbed the top of his head and said with gentle eyes, “Look, the pesticide that Qiu Xingyuan developed has helped many people!”\nA hint of pride appeared in Qiu Xingyuan’s eyes. Little Yu took the initiative to help Qiu Tong give away the pesticide by shouting out to the crowd. But her soft, childish voice was quickly drowned out by the surrounding bustle…\nTwo burly men pushed their way through the crowd and looked at Qiu Tong with fierce eyes. They asked in a hoarse voice, “Did you make the locust pesticide?”\n“There’s a problem with the pesticide distributed here! Everyone, don’t take it. When we went back to spray it, our bodies showed signs of an allergic reaction!”\n“My elder brother’s arms are covered in red spots. He has been sent to the hospital!”\n“They are swindlers! These pesticides are useless against locusts. Don’t be fooled by them!”\nThe burly men shouted and tried to overturn Qiu Tong’s stall, but Ke Le and the others quickly stood up to protect her.\nThe appearance of the burly men made the crowd hesitate. They looked down at the locust pesticide in their hands and were hesitant to bring it home.\nQiu Tong sized them up with a frown. She guessed that these people were looking for trouble. She asked in an annoyed tone, “What evidence do you have?”\nOne of the burly men immediately raised his arms and rolled up his sleeves, revealing patches of red spots on his skin. He even waved them around for the surrounding crowd to see.\n“I am the evidence!”\n“We have these red spots on our bodies. It must be the locust pesticide. Since you are the ones who made it, you have to take responsibility.”\n“You have to compensate me for the hospitalization fees, my loss of working time and any follow-up treatment fees!”\nThe red marks on the burly man’s arm were obvious. The onlookers, who had been initially hesitant, quickly threw away the locust pesticide in their hands and criticized Qiu Tong and Qiu Xingyuan. “I was wondering why a perfectly fine pesticide would be given away for free. So it’s poison!”\n“Take this pesticide back. Instead of eliminating the locusts, we fell sick!”\n“How can a kindergarten child understand chemicals? They must have colluded with others to cheat money!”\nWhen Qiu Xingqiao and Qiu Xingyu saw that their brother was being bullied, they hurriedly stood in front of the crowd with their hands on their hips and spoke up for him, “Our eldest brother is amazing. The locust pesticide he made will definitely be fine!”\n“Yes, you are the ones who don’t know how to use it. Why are you blaming Eldest Brother?”\nQiu Xingyu pouted, her eyes brimming with tears.\nThe onlookers did not buy their explanation. They clamored for the adult-in-charge to step forward and explain.\n“Calm down! We’re all here and we won’t just disappear. What are you guys fussing about?”\n“You scared my children. I want an explanation from you too!”\nQiu Tong squatted down worriedly and wiped Qiu Xingyu’s tears. She hugged her and patted her back as she spoke coldly.\nShe could almost confirm that these burly men were just here to stir up trouble. Qiu Tong narrowed her eyes, wanting to settle this with force.\nHowever, Qiu Xingyuan did not say a word. He walked to the pesticide on display and picked up two new bottles. He unscrewed the bottle cap and took some pesticide and smeared it on his own arm. Qiu Tong saw his actions and said nervously, “Qiu Xingyuan, what are you doing?”\nThe crowd was shocked by Qiu Xingyuan’s actions and stared at him.\nOne second, two seconds… two minutes passed. As expected, Qiu Xingyuan’s arm broke out in red spots, indicating an allergic reaction.",

      "content": "Chapter 113: Blame and Rebuke\nWhen the surrounding crowd saw that red spots had also appeared on Qiu Xingyuan’s body, they instantly erupted.\n“Look! We are seeing it with our own eyes. There must be something wrong with the pesticide!”\n“What other explanation do you have? Hurry up and recall your locust pesticide and compensate us!”\nThe burly men and the rest of the crowd pressured Qiu Tong and Qiu Xingyuan. Qiu Tong’s expression darkened. She had seen Qiu Xingyuan’s original formula with her own eyes. There was no ingredient that could cause allergic reactions! What went wrong?\nQiu Xingyuan saw a familiar face in the crowd. The pharmaceutical supervisor hid in the crowd in a panic and even took two steps back.\nQiu Xingyuan stared at his slightly flustered expression and asked with furrowed brows, “After I left the factory, did you further simplify the process again?”\n“Did you do away with some necessary steps in the process of making the pesticides in order to speed things up?”\nQiu Xingyuan had come up with the crux of the problem. The crowd stared at the pharmaceutical supervisor in unison, waiting for his answer.\nThe pharmaceutical supervisor clenched his fists nervously, his lips pale. He instinctively denied, “No, we made it according to the process!”\n“There’s clearly something wrong with your pesticide formula. Why are you pushing the blame on us?”\n“It’s impossible to simplify the production process of the factory’s assembly line. Anyway, all the modifications have been approved by you!”\n“Don’t try to change the topic! This has nothing to do with the factory!”\nQiu Tong could tell that something was wrong from the pharmaceutical supervisor’s expression. She shielded Qiu Xingyuan behind her and interrogated, “Since you said that there’s no problem with the factory’s production process, I am sure you are willing to get all the staff to come here now?”\n“We can verify everything face-to-face.”\n“Besides, there are surveillance cameras in the factories. We can take a look to see what went wrong!”\n“As long as there is concrete evidence pointing to us, we will definitely take responsibility!”\nThe pharmaceutical supervisor did not expect Qiu Tong to be so domineering. His temples were throbbing and his palms were sweating. He immediately tried to rouse the crowd by pointing at Qiu Tong. “How can I show you the surveillance footage of the factory?”\n“You guys have powerful connections backing you. Even if there’s a problem, you can settle it secretly. Even with the video footage, what can it prove?”\n“In the end, the victims are still these innocent civilians…”\nThe pharmaceutical supervisor’s words once again stirred up a commotion. The parents of the students who were already jealous of Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Tong stepped forward and muttered, “Didn’t they say that the Mayor’s personal commendation was just for show! This pesticide might not have been developed by Qiu Xingyuan.”\n“He has always been a quiet child. He is solitary and has strange manners.”\n“I heard that Qiu Tong has been very close to Mayor Shen and a few of the higher-ups. I have friends who have seen her entering and leaving high-end villas!”\n“This is not something a bunch of commoners like us can talk about. There must be something going on behind the scenes!”\nTheir discussion had changed from blaming Qiu Xingyuan and the locust pesticide to a personal attack on Qiu Tong’s family.\nThose words became increasingly harsh.\nQiu Xingyuan bit his thin lips tightly, and the taste of blood spread in his mouth. He listened to the accusations and slander, which were all without any evidence. But he knew in his heart that it must be because someone had arbitrarily adjusted the ratio of the pesticide to speed things up, resulting in the current allergic reaction.\nHowever, he had no evidence. Meanwhile, the crowd was clamoring for justice.\nQiu Xingyuan’s face was pale as if there was an iceberg engulfing him. He said, “I will take responsibility for the locust pesticide.”\nHis words indirectly admitted that he was the cause of the allergic reactions.\nThe crowd became very agitated. It was unknown who took the lead, but they actually pushed and pulled at Qiu Xingyuan. They scolded, “How are you going to take responsibility? There are locusts everywhere in the wheat field, and the locust pesticide is useless. We can’t buy any food!”\n“We’re going to starve to death. How are you going to take responsibility? Are you going to give us food?”\n“Yes, get the Qiu family to compensate!”\nQiu Xingyuan stood motionless in the middle of the crowd. His small face was stubborn, but his body was swaying, and his forehead was nearly bruised from all the jostling.\nQiu Tong grabbed Qiu Xingyu and Qiu Xingqiao and stuffed them into Ke Le’s arms to protect them. She quickly ran to Qiu Xingyuan’s side and protected his small body in her arms…",

      "content": "Chapter 114: Protective Apparatus\nThe commotion in the kindergarten was too great. When Chief Officer Fang received the news, he was so shocked that he immediately rushed over to maintain order.\nThe police officers drove the rioting crowd away with their shields and protected Qiu Tong and the children. Chief Officer Fang asked nervously, “Are you alright? Do you want me to escort you back? The situation here is a little complicated. Let us handle it…”\nChief Officer Fang tried his best to lower his voice, but the surrounding crowd still heard their conversation. They immediately shouted at the top of their lungs.\n“Did you see that?! The Qiu family is linked to the higher-ups. The locust pesticide problem hasn’t been resolved yet, and they’re leaving?”\n“We can’t let them go! The Qiu family must compensate us, or we’ll go to their house and block them!”\nThe noisy crowd tugged at Chief Officer Fang’s clothes agitatedly, asking for an explanation. As they argued, they ended up scratching his arm.\nChief Officer Fang gasped in pain and frantically pulled the police officers over to maintain order.\nSuch actions made the crowd resist even more. It developed into a riot.\nQiu Xingyu was so frightened that tears welled up in her eyes. Qiu Xingqiao held her hand tightly and comforted her, “Don’t be afraid. Close your eyes, things will be fine soon.”\nQiu Xingyu closed her eyes obediently. Qiu Xingqiao frowned and stared at Qiu Tong. He did not know why he was hoping that she could solve the tricky situation!\nOutside the crowd, Lin Shan crossed her arms and hid in a corner to observe the situation…\nShe had come with Chief Officer Fang to see Qiu Tong make a fool of herself. She had no intention of interfering.\nHowever, now that things had come to this, a scheming glint flashed across Lin Shan’s eyes. She took the initiative to walk out and attracted the attention of the crowd.\nShe deliberately stood on a higher ground and pretended to speak up for the farmers. She raised her voice and said, “Stop arguing!”\n“Qiu Tong and her child’s pesticide is the problem. Why are you causing trouble for Chief Officer Fang?”\n“Chief Officer Fang only approved the production of the locust pesticide. He didn’t know that there was a problem with the Qiu family’s formula, nor did he know that it would cause an allergic reaction…”\nLin Shan looked at Qiu Tong sarcastically, hinting to Chief Officer Fang that everything had happened because of Qiu Tong.\nWhen Chief Officer Fang saw that the crowd’s emotions had stabilized a little, he awkwardly tidied his wrinkled clothes, frowned and cleared his throat.\nLin Shan looked at the crowd and continued in a loud voice, “I know a factory that makes protective apparatus.”\n“We need to rush production of the pesticide to suppress the locust plague, right? Farmers need to use locust pesticide, but you’re also afraid that something will happen to your bodies!”\n“I can help contact the factory and get them to speed up the production of a batch of protective clothing. This will prevent the farmers from suffering from allergic reactions.”\n“At the same time, we can prevent the locust plague in the fields from worsening!”\nAfter Lin Shan finished speaking, the crowd finally calmed down. They put down the rotten eggs and vegetables that they were holding in their hands, discussing if what Lin Shan said was true.\n“Really? Are you lying to us?”\nThe crowd looked at Lin Shan doubtfully, wondering about her identity and the credibility of her words. However, the tense atmosphere finally eased a little.\nChief Officer Fang did not expect her to be so effective at such a critical juncture. He looked at Lin Shan with a complicated gaze, which changed from disdain to joy in just a few seconds. He turned to look at Qiu Tong. He was thinking that if he let things escalate, the higher-ups would definitely hold him accountable.\nIf Qiu Tong and the children’s reputations were harmed, the higher-ups would definitely be displeased.\nEven if there was something wrong with the locust pesticide, there was no way he could pin the blame on the Qiu family.\nLin Shan had stepped forward at this moment to help Qiu Tong solve the problem. She was able to give the crowd a solution and let this matter pass.\nChief Officer Fang thought for a moment and immediately decided to sign a contract with Lin Shan in the name of the government. “This batch of protective apparatus will be distributed to farmers who need to spray locust pesticide in the shortest time possible. Please go home and wait. Don’t cause trouble again!”\nAfter receiving this order, Lin Shan looked at Qiu Tong with increasingly disdainful eyes. She said sarcastically, “People shouldn’t try to stick their necks out if they don’t have the ability.”\n“Now, you still need someone else to clean up your mess. I really don’t know where your thick skin comes from!”\nQiu Xingyuan pursed his thin lips. His eyes were cold as he clenched his small fists and looked at Lin Shan with frustration.\nLin Shan raised her eyebrows provocatively. “Little brat, why are you glaring at me?”",

      "content": "Chapter 115: Government Order\nQiu Tong scooped up a bottle of locust pesticide, unscrewed the cap and placed it at the tip of her nose to sniff. She poured out two drops onto her skin, and sure enough, there were red spots.\nIt seemed that there was indeed a component of the pesticide that would cause an allergic reaction!\nQiu Tong was thinking about how to help Qiu Xingyuan clean up the mess caused by the locust pesticide.\nShe looked up at Lin Shan. The coldness in her eyes made Lin Shan too afraid to speak again.\nChief Officer Fang dispersed the crowd and picked up the scattered bottles. He looked at Qiu Tong and asked politely, “Shall I escort you and the children back? Although the crowd has already left, there might still be some malicious people waiting in the dark for an opportunity.”\n“It’s safer to let the police escort you home.”\nQiu Tong understood Chief Officer Fang’s good intentions. She squeezed into the backseat with the three children in her arms as the police car left with sirens blaring.\nLin Shan stared intently in the direction where the car had left. Grabbing the order form that Chief Officer Fang had given her, she rushed to Shu Xian’s factory.\nThe factory where Shu Xian produced protective gear was located in the suburbs. Lin Shan had been close to Shu Xian recently and was also familiar with the security guards. She pushed open the door and entered the office. She saw Shu Xian with his feet crossed and holding a game console, cursing incessantly.\nLin Shan frowned and waved her hand to disperse the cigarette smoke in the room. She strode gracefully to sit on his lap and hooked her arm around Shu Xian’s neck.\nShu Xian impatiently wanted to push Lin Shan away. “Move aside, don’t disturb me! Go over there and entertain yourself for a while…”\nLin Shan didn’t say anything else. She just waved the order form in front of him.\nShu Xian looked at the screen that displayed the words “Game Over”. He then looked at the order form. “Protective apparatus? Where did you get this?”\nLin Shan gave a simple recap of the locust pesticide incident. She thought that she would be able to hear Shu Xian’s praise, but unexpectedly, he threw the order aside in disdain. He took two deep puffs of his cigarette, narrowed his eyes, and puffed out a few smoke rings. “Although the government has ordered a lot of apparatus, there’s actually not much profit in this!”\n“The deadline to produce these protective apparatus is very tight. They want us to make them before the locusts get out of control.”\n“The government’s price is so low. And I have to pay the workers overtime. What profit is there for me? Let’s push this job to someone else!”\nShu Xian’s factory was quite big so he naturally looked down on this small sum of money.\nLin Shan’s heart surged with disdain at his short-sightedness. She adjusted her emotions and said gently, “Don’t be rash.”\n“You know that it’s an order from the government. Let’s just do Chief Officer Fang a favor. If we do a good job this time, we will be able to form a steady connection with the government. We will definitely benefit from this connection in the future, right?”\n“Some time ago, the government had a piece of land for sale. It’s said that it was handed over to a dealer who has a secret relationship with Chief Officer Fang.”\nShu Xian was convinced by her words. His heart was racing as he grabbed the phone on his desk and informed the factory to hurry up.\nHe raised his hand and hooked Lin Shan’s chin, his greasy palm touching her slender waist. “You helped me earn money. What do you want in return?”\nShu Xian patted Lin Shan’s butt. She laughed and threw herself into Shu Xian’s arms, pressing her heavy and round chest against his face.\n“Little demoness!”\nShu Xian’s eyes were filled with lust. He picked up Lin Shan and pressed her against the desk. He lifted her skirt and took off her panties.\nLin Shan raised her neck and moaned in a sweet voice. She swayed her hips against Shu Xian.\nShu Xian grabbed the order form and stuck it on Lin Shan’s smooth and fair back. He lowered his head and kissed her passionately, causing Lin Shan to tremble…\nThe door of the office was open. When the secretaries passing by heard the constant moaning and the sounds of furniture knocking, they quickly left, afraid that they would see something disgusting.\n…\nIn their villa, Qiu Xingyuan sat on the sofa with a cold face. Since returning home, he had ignored everyone and refused to speak.\nQiu Xingqiao and Little Yu carried some cut fruits over and wanted to coax him to eat a few, but Qiu Xingyuan only shook his head. His expression was solemn, and his eyes were filled with frustration.\nQiu Tong sighed and walked up to him. She rubbed Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu’s heads. “Go and eat at the dining table.”\n“Mommy and your elder brother have something to discuss. Be good!”\nQiu Xingqiao hesitated for a moment before leading Little Yu away.\nWhen Qiu Xingyuan saw her sitting opposite him, a hint of evasion flashed across his eyes. He stubbornly raised his chin.\nShe must be wanting to ask why he had made such a mistake and created such a lousy pesticide. That he had embarrassed her and even caused the Qiu family to suffer!\nQiu Xingyuan quietly clenched his fists and leaned back against the sofa nervously. He sat upright and looked straight at Qiu Tong. “What do you want to discuss?”",

She just poured a cup of water for Qiu Xingyuan and quietly looked into his eyes.\nQiu Xingyuan held the glass cup in his hand and bit his thin lips as he said, “I didn’t know about the allergic reaction to locust pesticide, but it’s too late to change the formula now.”\n“This pesticide incident was my mistake…”\nQiu Tong listened to him speak a little longer before suddenly leaning over and reaching out to him.\nQiu Xingyuan’s eyes flickered. He raised his little face stubbornly and refused to dodge. He would face whatever comes!\nThe hand that he thought would land on his face paused in the air for a moment before landing on his head.\nQiu Tong rubbed the top of his head. When she saw Qiu Xingyuan’s furious expression, she burst out laughing. “The locust pesticide has a suppressive effect on locusts.”\n“It’s your first time developing a pesticide, so it’s normal that you weren’t able to consider every aspect of the formula thoroughly. Don’t blame yourself too much.”\nQiu Xingyuan stood rooted to the ground in shock. He did not expect Qiu Tong to do this. He stared blankly at her, forgetting to dodge her hand.\n“You don’t blame me?”\nQiu Xingyuan was frowning. Qiu Tong shook her head in surprise and asked, “Why should I blame you?”\n“You must have been frightened by the chaotic crowd earlier. This matter is not something you can solve. Mommy will settle it!”\n“Don’t worry. Mommy is here. Even if the sky falls, I will hold it up!”\nQiu Tong’s body emitted a warm glow, causing Qiu Xingyuan to be a little stunned.\nQiu Tong hugged him. She patted Qiu Xingyuan’s back and said softly, “You’ve already done very well.”\nAt this moment, Qiu Xingyuan felt a twinge in his nose. He endured the urge to nestle in Qiu Tong’s arms and bury his face in her neck.\nQiu Xingqiao and Little Yu were secretly watching the scene at the dining table. When they saw what was happening, they ran over jealously and threw themselves into Qiu Tong’s arms.\nLittle Yu muttered in a childish voice, “Mommy is biased. Little Yu wants a hug too!”\nQiu Xingqiao squeezed his head into Qiu Tong’s arms. He was silent, but his body language showed that he was extremely reliant and trusting of her.\nQiu Tong looked down at the three children in her arms and couldn’t help smiling.\nIt looked like these children’s attitude towards her had improved a lot!\nThe family of four huddled together in the living room. Qiu Xingyuan said awkwardly, “But the allergic reaction incident has blown up. What can you do?”\nQiu Tong patted his head. “It’s not your place to worry about these adult matters!”\nIn the corner, Ye Luan pushed open the door of the bedroom and quietly looked at them. He knew what had happened at the kindergarten.\nHe lowered his head hesitantly and touched the area at his waist. His eyes flickered with dilemma, but he eventually dropped his hand and quietly closed the door.\nYe Luan sat by the bed and lifted his shirt to look at the chip at his waist.\nThis was what those people chasing after him wanted!\nHe had known from the beginning that there was a chip in his skin that contained information about the human modification plan.\nIf Auntie Qiu obtained this information and used it, the farmers would no longer be afraid of the locust pesticide. They would no longer show symptoms of allergy.\nAuntie Qiu had been very good to him. He should have helped the Qiu family…\nHowever, before he went to prison, his father had warned him not to hand the chip over to anyone else. Otherwise, he would be in big trouble!\nYe Luan clenched his fists and rubbed the bed frame gently. He quietly listened to the sounds outside the door and frowned.\nIn the living room, Qiu Tong coaxed the children to sleep. She returned to her room and took out her phone. She looked at the number in her contact list and dialed.\nA few days ago, when Song Yan let her have the sniper rifle in the black market, they had also exchanged contact information.\nBeep beep beep—\nThe phone rang for two seconds before it was answered. “Can we meet soon?”\nThe signal paused for a few seconds. Qiu Tong looked at the notification on the phone and frowned. “Hello?”\nIn front of the computer screen, Song Yan paused the audio recording and casually placed his headset aside.\nHe asked softly, “What’s the matter?”\n“I heard that some farmers caused trouble outside the kindergarten. Do you need my help?”\n“If you want, I can step out and prove Qiu Xingyuan’s innocence. To show the public that there is no problem with the formula of the locust pesticide.”\nSong Yan’s tone was gentle and concerned. He had disrupted Qiu Tong’s prepared speech. She cleared her throat awkwardly. “You’re quite thoughtful, but Chief Officer Fang’s appearance has already aroused the hostility of the farmers.”\n“I won’t trouble you with this matter.”",

      "content": "Chapter 117: Suburban Military Base\nSong Yan swirled his wine glass and asked with interest, “Then… what do you want me to do?”\nQiu Tong zoomed in on the screenshot and asked bluntly, “Do you know of an abandoned military base in S City? It seems to be in the suburbs.”\n“Can you find a way to bring me in?”\nQiu Tong probed, “I can pretend to be your guard. With your status, you should be able to help me get in?”\nSong Yan suddenly became wary. Qiu Tong could tell from his pause that there was something wrong. She explained, “I want to find out if there are any abandoned helicopters in the military base. If they can be modified, we can hand them over to the farmers…”\n“Using a helicopter to spray pesticide can prevent them from getting allergic reactions from being in direct contact with the pesticide.”\nQiu Tong doodled on a piece of white paper and said casually, “This can also increase efficiency.”\n“We might be able to keep the locust plague under control right from the start. It would be good for the farmers and us.”\nSong Yan raised an eyebrow. He was somewhat doubtful of Qiu Tong’s suggestion. He had some understanding of military equipment and weapons. Modifying a helicopter was extremely difficult!\nHe tapped his fingers on the desktop, making a tapping sound. “The helicopter design is classified.”\n“Ordinary people have never seen it before, much less be able to modify it into a pesticide spraying machine.”\nQiu Tong understood that Song Yan would not believe her just by her words alone. She wanted to try and explain the modification plan in a simple and easy-to-understand way, but ended up saying, “Bring me to see the helicopters. If I can modify them, it will be good for everyone.”\n“If I can’t, it won’t be any loss to you either.”\nSong Yan raised his index finger to his forehead. He felt that Qiu Tong was very interesting. He replied, “Alright.”\n“I can bring you there, but do you dare to make a bet with me?”\n“I will lose the bet if you can modify the helicopter. You will lose the bet if you can’t…”\n“Whoever loses must fulfill a wish by the other party. As long as the wish does not violate the law or the basic moral principles of the person, it must be satisfied.”\nSong Yan narrowed his eyes and asked, “Do you dare?”\nQiu Tong frowned and nodded after a moment of hesitation. “Deal!”\n…\nThe next day at the heavily-guarded abandoned military base in the suburbs, a few officers waited outside with ingratiating expressions.\nSong Yan drove the car to the checkpoint with Qiu Tong. The officer guarding the door hurriedly ran over and bowed, “Mr. Song Yan, what brings you here? Is there something urgent?”\nQiu Tong looked at the military equipment behind the huge metal door. She was speechless.\nSong Yan pushed open the car door in his military boots and raised his hand for Qiu Tong to help him out. His eyes were cold as he said, “Are there any abandoned helicopters?”\n“Bring us over to take a look and prepare some tools for Miss Qiu.”\nAfter Song Yan finished giving his instructions, he looked at Qiu Tong’s profile curiously. He raised his eyebrows and said softly, “Don’t forget our bet.”\nQiu Tong nodded and looked at the officer. “I am looking for a smaller, lighter model that can be modified to spray pesticide for agricultural purposes…”\nThe officer was stunned. His eyes widened several times, and his pupils were filled with shock and disdain as he smiled and said, “Don’t joke around!”\n“These helicopters are used for combat. Do you think you can modify them just like that?”\nSong Yan heard his tone and glared at him unhappily. Due to Song Yan’s status, the officers did not dare to say anything else and had no choice but to lead Qiu Tong to the aircrafts.\nThe officers followed behind, muttering amongst themselves. “Where did Mr. Song Yan meet such a woman?”\n“She only knows how to talk big. Does she know what a helicopter is? She even said that she wants to modify it?”\nQiu Tong did not take their mutterings to heart.\nThe few of them walked to the area where the aircraft were stored. One of the officers introduced the various aircraft to her. “This is a helicopter that was still in active service last year.”\n“These are airplane models from more than 10 years ago. The parts are old and can’t be used anymore.”\nThe officer spoke in a perfunctory manner. Qiu Tong did not listen to his narration at all. She stared at the aircraft carefully and tapped her hands absentmindedly. When she reached a particular aircraft, she stopped in her tracks, her eyes shining.",

      "content": "Chapter 118: Repairing Aircrafts\nQiu Tong stared at the few aircraft with a hint of lamentation in her eyes. She said in a mild tone, “These scrapped aircraft are all kept in this base.”\n“It’s such a waste. They can be flown again with just a little repair and modification, but they’re left lying here gathering the dust.”\nWhen the officer heard her words, contempt and disdain flashed across his face. However, because Song Yan was present, he could only pretend to be respectful and say, “You don’t know.”\n“On the surface, these helicopters don’t look like they have any problems, but various parts inside are already damaged beyond salvage.”\n“Several of them suddenly malfunctioned during flight and nearly crashed, so they were sent to this base.”\nSong Yan had one hand in his pocket as he lazily raised his other hand to pat the metal sheet of the helicopter. He had no intention of speaking up for Qiu Tong.\nWhen the official saw this, his tone became even more unpleasant. He said sarcastically, “You might have watched too many movies that make it look like modifying an aircraft is a simple matter… in actual fact, it requires a lot of professional knowledge. You can take a look, but don’t touch anything…”\n“It’s a small matter if you damage something, but if you end up hurting yourself, we won’t be able to bear the responsibility!”\n“Just take a look around. We have good tea in our office. Mr. Song Yan and this lady, please take a seat and rest.”\nQiu Tong noticed their sarcasm and stared at Song Yan. “Give me a set of tools.”\nSong Yan nodded and gestured.\nThe guard had no choice but to hand over the toolbox reluctantly. Qiu Tong opened it and glanced at it before jumping into a helicopter with it in her hand.\nIn the cockpit, Qiu Tong used a wrench to remove the control panel of the mainframe. She looked at the few broken wires inside and twisted open the connection without a word.\nSong Yan did not take her suggestion seriously at first, but when he saw Qiu Tong’s professional actions, he nodded and gestured for the officer to bring two ladders over. He stood outside the control panel and said, “Can it be fixed?”\nQiu Tong did not reply. She quietly dismantled a few of the helicopter’s panels, picked up the replacement control panel, and slammed it against the connections.\nKnock knock—\nThe officer was stunned by her work. He stood there gaping.\nQiu Tong estimated that the damaged areas had already been repaired. She used a detection device to test the functions. Her eyes flickered with confidence as she pressed the buttons. The control lamp instantly lit up, and beeping sounds rang out in the cockpit.\nThe helicopter’s propeller began to rotate. The officers cried out in disbelief, “It’s really fixed?”\nThey looked at each other and the same thought popped up in their minds.\nThis woman was so formidable. If she could repair the other abandoned planes for them, wouldn’t it save them a lot of money?\nWhen the time came, the higher-ups would definitely reward them! At the thought of this, one of the officers went up to her with an ingratiating expression. “Miss Qiu, can you take a look at the other planes? Can… can they still be fixed?”\nQiu Tong dusted off her hands and jumped out of the cockpit. She brushed off the dust on her body and waved two fingers in front of their eyes.\nThe officers were confused. One of them asked, “What do you mean by that?”\nQiu Tong immediately demanded, “$300,000 for each aircraft.”\nSuch a sky-high repair fee?!\nFor a moment there, the officers could not come to a decision, but Qiu Tong said nonchalantly, “For every aircraft that is scrapped and left here, it will cost tens of millions of dollars to develop a new model. My repair fee is reasonable… consider it carefully.”\n“Song Yan, I want these aircraft.”\nQiu Tong recalled her agreement with Song Yan and pointed at a few of them. Song Yan nodded and instructed someone to help Qiu Tong with the paperwork.\nThose helicopters from the military base should be able to be modified for agricultural purposes.\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes and patted Song Yan’s shoulder. “Does your bet with me still stand?”\nSong Yan raised his eyebrows slightly. He looked forward to Qiu Tong asking something from him. He replied readily, “Of course.”\n“If you’ve already decided, tell me as soon as possible.”\nQiu Tong did not stand on ceremony with him. She pointed at the few aircraft and said, “I can successfully modify these aircraft into drones over the next few days. Can you give me full authority over them? In other words, I must be able to use and dispatch them as I please…”",

      "content": "Chapter 119: Affection\nSong Yan did not expect Qiu Tong to want the right to use the drones. He stared at Qiu Tong for a while, pondering before he nodded in agreement.\nThe officers calculated the military funds and felt their hearts bleed at the thought of all that money that would flow into Qiu Tong’s wallet.\nQiu Tong was a mere woman. But she was able to earn such an exorbitant fee just by removing a few screws?\nThe officers muttered in their hearts with dissatisfaction. They wished they voice out their displeasure. Qiu Tong could naturally see their distress but she ignored it. Instead, she clapped her hands and said, “Bring over all the aircraft that you want repaired. I can modify them now…”\n“It’s been hard on you, Miss Qiu! What do think about these aircraft here?”\nThe officers looked surprised and happy. They felt like they were on a emotional rollercoaster ride as they happily brought Qiu Tong to the storage location of two heavy-duty aircraft.\nQiu Tong sized them up and nodded. She had someone move the ladder over and turned to enter the cockpit. But she needed an assistant.\n“Mr. Song Yan, if you have time, why don’t you help me with some odd jobs?”\nQiu Tong’s tone was relaxed. Song Yan saw the smile on her lips and his heart skipped a beat. He nodded and walked to Qiu Tong’s side.\nRepairing heavy-duty aircraft was already rather difficult, not to mention that the damage to these machines were a result of major attacks.\nQiu Tong carefully examined the damage. She stared at the control panel and raised her hand. “A wrench.”\nSong Yan stared at the side of her face in a daze. Even after waiting a long time, Qiu Tong did not receive her requested tool. She frowned and looked up at him. She waved her hand and said, “With the current efficiency, I’m afraid these planes will take three days and three nights to repair!”\nQiu Tong’s words brought back Song Yan’s mind back to the present. He looked at the woman in front of him and his heart stirred.\nIn that instant, he really wanted Jin Yang to lose Qiu Tong and completely cut off any possibility between the two of them…\n…\nIn the factories in the suburbs, Lin Shan recalled Shu Xian’s attitude. She was a little worried about the government’s order for the protective gear, so she rushed to the factories to personally supervise the production.\nRelying on her relationship with Shu Xian, Lin Shan asked the manager to bring over two chairs. She sat near the air conditioning ventilation shaft. She ate fruit and pointed at the tired workers. “Be more careful in your work. This batch is an order from the government.”\n“If anything goes wrong, you will definitely be held responsible!”\nThe workers had stayed up all night to work overtime for the past few days. They were completely exhausted and were irritated by Lin Shan’s sarcastic words.\nAn old man who was very experienced stood up and threw the protective suit he was working on into the production line. He turned to Lin Shan and said, “It’s such a tight deadline to produce a large number of protective suits. And no additional workers have been hired yet. Do you think we can just grow an extra pair of arms to work faster. We can’t do this!”\nLin Shan did not expect them to resist. She stood up in a panic and said, “I was just looking out for you!”\n“If the government orders are done well, you guys will definitely benefit!”\n“By then, I will talk to Shu Xian about givng you guys promotions and salary increases!”\nLin Shan had no right to do so, but she still made a promise to the workers in a loud voice. She raised her hand and said, “As long as you can produce these protective gear within the deadline, the company will definitely give you a big bonus! Hurry up and work…”\nThe workers knew of Lin Shan’s relationship with Shu Xian and did not believe her nonsense at all. They were dissatisfied.\nLin Shan was bored at the factory. When she heard that Shu Xian had arrived, she hurriedly ran out and took Shu Xian’s arm as they walked out of the factory.\nTheir factory was rather close to the abandoned military base. Lin Shan took two steps forward and saw Qiu Tong, who was covered in engine oil…\nQiu Tong swatted the dirt off her body with her gloves and wiped the dust off her face with the back of her hand.\nLin Shan sized her up and thought that she had lost favor with Chief Officer Fang. She happily tried to provoke her. “Who is this?”\n“Why have you become so down and out? You’re so dirty. Did you go out to repair machines for the farmers?”\n“Life is so hard. Why don’t you work in our factory?”\nLin Shan covered her red lips and said sarcastically, “It’ll definitely pay more than your current part-time job!”",

      "content": "Chapter 120: Changing Her Sugar Daddy\nQiu Tong had been repairing the scrapped aircraft at the abandoned military base. Earlier on, Song Yan said that he had something to do and needed to leave. Hence, they went their separate ways then.\nShe did not expect to meet Lin Shan and Shu Xian!\nQiu Tong was feeling sore all over and couldn’t be bothered with Lin Shan. She always thought of Lin Shan as just a stray dog barking at the roadside, but her behavior had become increasingly outrageous.\nLin Shan thought that Qiu Tong had lost her backer and was in dire straits, that was why she was enduring her ridicule and not answering. She said sarcastically, “Now that there’s no source of income, how are you going to support your three children? I almost forgot that the locust pesticide your son developed will cause allergies…”\n“Maybe in a few days, you’ll have to return all the patent fees and give some additional compensation.”\n“You’re so beautiful. Why don’t you quickly find another sugar daddy? Maybe you can sell yourself to pay your debts!”\nQiu Tong narrowed her cold eyes and stared fixedly at Lin Shan. Lin Shan was instantly intimidated by Qiu Tong’s aura and did not dare to speak more nonsense.\nQiu Tong’s gaze landed on Shu Xian. With a wicked smile on her lips, she reminded him in a light tone, “I heard that Lin Shan helped you get an order from the government? Manager Shu is so smart, I advise you to think about what Lin Shan’s motive is…”\n“Since she can persuade me to look for another sugar daddy, then perhaps that government order is just a way for Lin Shan to please and get close to Chief Officer Fang?”\nQiu Tong saw Lin Shan’s expression change and raised her eyebrows. “Manager Shu, don’t let that woman fool you.”\nHearing Qiu Tong’s accusation, Shu Xian immediately turned and shook off Lin Shan’s hand, questioning her in a hoarse and ruthless voice, “Are you trying to seduce Chief Officer Fang? B*tch! I’ll tell the factory to stop operations immediately…”\nLin Shan was a little flustered and helpless. She hurriedly chased after Shu Xian. She turned around and glared at Qiu Tong venomously. Biting her red lips, she blocked Shu Xian’s path and explained in a sweet voice, “Don’t let her use you anymore. Chief Officer Fang is already so old. How can he compare to you?”\n“I’m sincere to you. Can’t you tell?”\nLin Shan flirted with Shu Xian. Qiu Tong watched as she shamelessly seduced the man right in the open. A hint of disgust flashed across her eyes as she left.\n…\nIn the capital, Jin Yang was handling official business in the study.\nThe massive outbreak of locusts due to extreme droughts brought serious damage to farmers’ fields.\nJin Yang flipped through a few reports and frowned when he saw the photos. He didn’t expect the locust plague to spread so quickly.\nStaring at the screen, he suddenly remembered that Qiu Tong had once mentioned to him about the locust plague. For a moment, his emotions were in turmoil.\nHow was she doing now?\nJin Yang’s mind wandered for a moment. He immediately contacted Mayor Shen.\nWhen Mayor Shen saw the call from the capital, he jumped up from his chair in fright and answered the call respectfully. “Mr. President…”\n“Increase the production of locust pesticide in the near future. Transfer the locust pesticide that has been produced to all parts of the country for farmers to use.”\n“We must control the locust plague! I’ll leave this to you. Don’t disappoint me!”\nJin Yang’s order made Mayor Shen nervous but also a little proud and happy. Leaving the production of locust pesticide to him meant that there would be an additional chance of him being promoted in the future. At the very least, he would be able to gain some status!\nMayor Shen quickly agreed and asked, “Do you have any other instructions?”\nJin Yang paused for a moment before asking casually, “How have they been?”\nMayor Shen found it a little strange. He had clearly seen the president and Qiu Tong together not too long ago…\nCould it be that they would miss each other even just after half a day?\nMayor Shen could not help quietly speculating, but he did not dare to voice out his thoughts. He immediately answered, “Miss Qiu and the children are all rather nice. Some time ago, after the kindergarten’s award ceremony ended, I heard that the children of the Qiu family have been very well-liked by their teachers.”\nMayor Shen glanced at the duration of the call and felt a little excited. He did not expect to be talking with the president for so long!\nHis eyes darted around as he tried to think of more talking points. Thinking of his relationship with Qiu Tong, he said obsequiously, “Sir, you’ve been making so many trips between the capital and S City recently. You still have to handle so many political matters. You must take care of your health!”",

      "content": "Chapter 121: New Locust Pesticide\nJin Yang frowned in confusion when he heard Mayor Shen’s baffling concern.\nHe casually flipped through a few documents, his gaze landing on the word “Qiu” in the last line. He said softly, “I’ll leave the matters of S City to you. If anything happens to Qiu Tong…”\nMayor Shen had been an official for many years. When he heard Jin Yang’s words, he immediately understood what he meant and hurriedly said, “I will definitely take care of things!”\nJin Yang hung up the phone. His index finger rubbed against the word. He then called Shao An to come over. “Book me a plane ticket.”\n“To S City in two weeks’ time.”\nShao An blinked. He thought of the children who had appeared in the news footage and understood that Jin Yang wanted to visit Qiu Tong and her family.\nHe immediately bought the plane ticket, but he kept stealing glances at Jin Yang from time to time. The curiosity in his heart intensified.\nShao An straightened his spine and shifted closer to Jin Yang’s side. He bent over and whispered into Jin Yang’s ear, “Sir, not only do the children of the Qiu family look 80% like you, they are also very smart!”\n“Did you really not know of their existence before?”\n“Do you need me to help you cover up this matter? Transfer Miss Qiu and the children to a safer place. After all, their relationship with you…”\nShao An tried using what he thought was an indirect method to probe.\nHowever, Jin Yang’s expression darkened. He looked up and stared into Shao An’s eyes. He asked with his thin lips, “Are you very free now?”\nShao An instinctively felt a hint of danger. He hurriedly shook his head and shut his mouth, swallowing his curiosity. How would he dare to ask again?\n…\nIn S City, the matter of the locust pesticide containing an allergen was blown out of proportion. The officials had yet to give an explanation.\nThe farmers no longer dared to use the pesticide. They could only watch as the locust larvae in their grain fields gradually multiply. The locust plague was growing more and more intense. Everyone was anxious and uneasy as they watched the farmlands about to be destroyed, but they could not think of a solution.\nLu Sheng he heard a few farmers muttering when he passed by the fields. “Don’t tell me that only the Qiu family can make locust pesticide?”\nThese words made Lu Sheng’s heart surge with greed. He stood in the fields and pondered for a while before rushing to Lu Zhiling’s clinic.\n“The locust pesticide on the market now is worth a sky-high price! We can take this opportunity to earn a good profit!”\nWhen Lu Zhiling heard his suggestion, a hint of worry appeared in her beautiful eyes. “But the pesticide needs to be mixed in a strict ratio…”\nLu Sheng looked a little impatient. “How can the farmers know whether the locust pesticide is effective or not now?”\n“We just need to give them some psychological comfort. If there are any problems, we can blame it on Qiu Tong. Or that the locust plague has already spread beyond our control. What has it got to do with us? Don’t tell me the farmers can still demand compensation from us?”\nLu Zhiling was convinced by him and quickly developed and modified a new “locust pesticide”.\nThey deliberately chose the location where Qiu Tong had distributed the locust pesticide. They erected a signboard and set up a stall to sell it.\n“This is a new kind of locust pesticide. It will definitely kill the larvae without causing any allergic reactions!”\n“You will benefit from buying it now. Don’t miss this great opportunity…”\nLu Sheng kept shouting. When the farmers heard that there was a new type of pesticide, they rushed over from all over to buy it.\nIn just a few hours, sales of the new locust pesticide was shot up.\nLu Sheng and Lu Zhiling looked at the huge wad of cash and couldn’t help smiling.\nQiu Tong arrived at the kindergarten to bring the children home. She stopped in her tracks when she saw Lu Sheng and Lu Zhiling.\nWhen she realized that the Lu siblings were selling locust pesticide, she found it even more strange.\nCarrying his small school bag, Qiu Xingyuan quietly observed the stall in front of him.\nA woman bought two bottles of locust pesticide and accidentally sprinkled two drops on the ground. She cursed her clumsiness and left.\nQiu Xingyuan squatted down and quietly looked at the two drops of liquid. He frowned and sensed that something was wrong.\nHe walked to Lu Sheng’s stall and said in a clear voice, “Has your locust pesticide been tested and certified by the government? There’s a problem with the ratio of ingredients you have used. It will cause the effects of the pesticide to be unstable, and it might even have a very negative effect.”\n“It’ll be a big problem if you use it wantonly.”\nQiu Xingyuan stared at Lu Sheng with burning eyes as he blurted out the truth.",

      "content": "Chapter 122: Destroying The Stall\nWhen the farmers heard Qiu Xingyuan’s doubts, they put down the locust pesticide warily. Some even started to cancel their payment, choosing to observe the situation first.\nLu Sheng glared at Qiu Xingyuan fiercely. His business had been affected and his anger was surging.\nMore and more people gathered around the stall. Lu Sheng rolled up his sleeves and pointed at Qiu Xingyuan, shouting, “Look clearly at who he is!”\n“A while ago, the locust pesticide that went wrong was developed by a child from the Qiu family. His own pesticide was problematic, and now, he’s slandering us. He obviously failed to earn any money and wants to drag us down with him! He’s clearly jealous!”\nLu Sheng spat and gritted his teeth as he slammed the locust pesticide onto the table. He boasted, “We’ve done testing!”\n“There’s definitely no problem. Please don’t believe a child’s nonsense…”\nLu Sheng looked at Qiu Tong and pointed at her rudely, publicly scolding and slandering her. “Who knows how Qiu Tong teaches her children? She actually lets her children cheat and harm others!”\n“These children are illegitimate without a father. No wonder they lack discipline!”\n“If there had been someone in the family to take charge of their upbringing, the children wouldn’t have become like this. How pitiful…”\nLu Sheng clicked his tongue. Qiu Xingqiao’s eyes turned red from anger and he quietly clenched his fists.\nWhile the crowd discussed the background of Qiu Tong and the children, Qiu Xingqiao finally lost control and shook off Qiu Tong’s hand. He ran to Lu Sheng’s stall and lifted his leg to kick apart two wooden beams.\nThe table tilted as the wood broke, and all the locust pesticide fell to the ground.\nQiu Xingqiao ran over and stepped on the pesticide bottle. In an instant, the pesticide flowed all over the ground and the smell of locust pesticide filled the air.\nLu Sheng felt as if he was looking at the cash in his hand fly away. He was so angry that he wanted to grab Qiu Xingqiao by the collar and raise his hand to hit the boy.\n“How can you bully children?”\n“The children of the Qiu family are really delinquent. No matter what, the boy shouldn’t have destroyed the stall!”\nThe onlookers were watching the commotion and had no intention of intervening. Qiu Tong frowned and wanted to attack.\nKe Le and the others happened to pass by after picking up Ye Luan. The mercenaries immediately surrounded them. Ke Le hit Lu Sheng’s wrist. Lu Sheng released his grip on Qiu Xingqiao in pain, while the mercenary caught the falling Qiu Xingqiao.\nKe Le shielded Qiu Xingqiao behind him and instantly instructed his team, who were well-trained in controlling unruly situations.\nLu Sheng and the clinic staff were surrounded by mercenaries. The atmosphere between the two sides was tense and at a stalemate. No one dared to move.\nWhen Mayor Shen received Jin Yang’s call, he kept thinking about showing concern for Qiu Tong’s situation. He had originally wanted to go to the kindergarten to make small talk with Qiu Tong and ask if she had encountered any problems recently and needed help. But now that he had witnessed such a chaotic situation, he was so frightened that cold sweat immediately ran down his back.\n“Move aside! What are you doing?”\nMayor Shen stepped forward to stop both sides. When he saw Lu Zhiling and Lu Sheng, he scolded them sternly. “What’s going on?”\nHe turned to look at Qiu Tong and saw that she looked extremely unhappy. He hurriedly asked in a gentle tone, “Miss Qiu, are you alright? Are you hurt anywhere?”\nWhen Lu Zhiling saw Mayor Shen appear, she came out from behind and walked up to him, pretending to be aggrieved as she said, “Mayor Shen, you came at the right time.”\n“Our clinic knows that the situation in the grain fields is extremely serious. The farmers are all very anxious, so we worked overnight to develop this locust pesticide to sell it.”\n“But the Qiu family children came to destroy our stall and even spilled our pesticide.”\nLu Zhiling fiddled with her curly hair. Sensing everyone’s eyes on her, she continued. “I know that Mayor Shen hasn’t been able to sleep the entire night due to the locust plague. The clinic wants to solve Mayor Shen’s problem…”\nMayor Shen looked back at Qiu Tong guiltily and coughed lightly to interrupt Lu Zhiling.\nQiu Xingqiao was so angry that he shrugged his shoulders in a huff. The knuckles of his fists were slightly swollen as he said, “Eldest Brother kindly pointed out to them that there was something wrong with their pesticide. But they started scolding Mommy and us…”\nQiu Tong could sense that Qiu Xingqiao’s anger had not subsided. She placed her hand gently on the top of his head and rubbed it.",

      "content": "Chapter 123: Solution\nMayor Shen looked a little nervous. He put on an official tone and reprimanded the Lu siblings. “You need to be certified by the government to sell locust pesticide.”\n“The pesticide can only be sold after the tests show that the content and effects are satisfactory. Now, quickly pack up the things on the ground and go back to wait for news!”\nMayor Shen looked at Lu Zhiling’s slightly dissatisfied expression. He was afraid that she would say something that would make Qiu Tong unhappy, so he frowned as he hinted at her.\n“Gathering a crowd and inciting a riot. If the situation is serious, you will be arrested!”\n“Besides, you’re all adults. How can you target and bully kindergarteners? This is ridiculous!”\nMayor Shen reprimanded Lu Sheng and Lu Zhiling before sending someone to disperse everyone…\nAlthough Lu Zhiling was unwilling, she had no choice but to obey and leave.\nThrough the rearview mirror, Lu Sheng saw Mayor Shen asking about the condition of the Qiu family children with concern. He even wanted to send them to the hospital for a checkup. He could not help nudging Lu Zhiling’s arm. Pointing out the window, he said, “Look at Mayor Shen’s expression when he gazes at Qiu Tong!”\n“He had the same look in his eyes when he first got together with you!”\nLu Zhiling frowned and turned to look at Mayor Shen. She widened her eyes when she saw him respectfully escorting Qiu Tong into his private car.\nLu Sheng nagged, “Mayor Shen hasn’t been coming to look for you as much lately. Maybe he’s tired of you and has lost interest in you!”\n“In this situation, we have to quickly extort a sum from him. Otherwise, it will be too late!”\nLu Zhiling also thought that Mayor Shen had taken a liking to Qiu Tong and wanted to take her as his lover. Her beautiful face twisted.\nHer eyes flickered with resentment and viciousness as she muttered, “Qiu Tong! Just you wait…”\n…\nOver the past few days, Qiu Tong had been repairing aircraft in the abandoned military base every day.\nThe more time those officers spent with her, the more they understood that Qiu Tong was truly capable. The initial contempt in their hearts was completely wiped away. They now often gathered around Qiu Tong to help her, trying to secretly learn some of her skills.\n“Miss Qiu, are you really going to use these helicopters that you modified for agriculture?”\n“This is such a waste. They’re all combat machines! The guns and cannons on them are all good to use.”\nAfter getting to know Qiu Tong better, one of the officers voiced his regrets when he heard her motive.\nQiu Tong was busy modifying the storage box that would be filled with pesticide. She had also repaired the gun barrel. She said softly, “It’s not like there’s only one use for planes. It’s just that I need them for the locusts now.”\nThe officer did not understand. He pretended to be impressed and handed the wrench over…\nAt the protective gear factory in the suburbs, the first batch of protective apparatus was produced and sent to the farmers’ homes.\nThe farmers wore the thick protective gear to spray the locust pesticide as they walked in their grain fields. As expected, this temporarily resolved the allergy problem.\nThe citizens of S City once again threw themselves into destroying the locusts, and the discussion about the Qiu family gradually died down.\nAs the protective gear had played a key role in the battle against the locusts, Mayor Shen and Chief Officer Fang specially invited Lin Shan to dinner.\nLin Shan deliberately changed into her most alluring dress and put on her precious pearl earrings. She proudly raised her glass and clinked it with Chief Officer Fang’s. “It’s our duty to help the government solve its problems. You’re too kind!”\nChief Officer Fang was just about to praise Lin Shan in front of Mayor Shen, but one of the service staff gently pushed open the door and said, “Sorry, there’s a Miss Qiu who wants to come in. She said she has something to tell you…”\nMayor Shen and Chief Officer Fang looked at each other and hurriedly stood up from their chairs to adjust their clothes, before letting the service staff bring Qiu Tong in.\nAt this moment, the hearts of the two officials were thumping. They guessed Qiu Tong’s motive for this visit and were slightly nervous.\nLin Shan frowned. She found their reaction strange.\nQiu Tong pushed the door open and was not surprised to see Lin Shan. She just looked at Chief Officer Fang and Mayor Shen and said calmly, “I’ve already found a solution to the allergy problem and a way to curb the speed at which the locust plague is spreading.”",

      "content": "Chapter 124: Something Bad Happened In The Grain Fields\nMayor Shen’s right eyelid twitched violently when he heard Qiu Tong’s words.\nHe thought that Qiu Tong was worried that the locust pesticide would cause a huge commotion and implicate the Qiu family. He hurriedly explained Lin Shan’s situation to her. “Miss Qiu, Miss Lin Shan has already thought of a solution to the locust pesticide problem.”\n“The protective gear developed by their factory can prevent the pesticide from making contact with human skin.”\n“Don’t worry, I’ve already sent people to control the spread of the rumors. The discussion about the Qiu family’s locust pesticide won’t continue…”\nMayor Shen was trying his best to please Qiu Tong, wanting to put her at ease.\nLin Shan, on the other hand, became arrogant and smug. She sat at the round table and tilted her head to look at Qiu Tong. She said sarcastically, “Sigh, I beg you, Miss Qiu, please think twice before doing anything in the future. Otherwise, you keep troubling others to clean up after your mess. How annoying…”\n“You must have heard the news that Chief Officer Fang and Mayor Shen invited me to dinner and specially came here to claim credit, right?”\nLin Shan fiddled with her nails, not noticing that Chief Officer Fang and Mayor Shen’s faces had turned pale. They stole glances at Qiu Tong’s face, their bodies trembling.\n“Stop dreaming! You have no business being here. Go home and take care of your children!”\nLin Shan still wanted to say something, but Mayor Shen suddenly interrupted her fiercely, “Don’t spout nonsense!”\n“The locust pesticide developed by Miss Qiu Tong is very helpful to us. The allergies are just a small problem. It’s not worth mentioning…”\nLin Shan looked up in surprise, her gaze wandering between Mayor Shen and Qiu Tong. She retorted indignantly, “What small problem? If not for our protective apparatus being so effective, the farmers would definitely not be able to control the situation with the locust plague now! The higher-ups will blame us!”\nAs the three of them argued, a subordinate pushed open the door and rushed in.\nThe subordinate looked at everyone present and tried to slow his breathing as he said to Mayor Shen, “Something bad has happened to the grain fields.”\n“The use of protective gear by the farmers solved the problem of the locust pesticide. However, the materials used to make the clothes are very thick and there are very few ventilation holes. The farmers got heat stroke after spraying for a period of time… several men have already fainted and are still unconscious!”\nThe subordinate glanced at Lin Shan and added, “Also, the weight of the protective suit exceeds all previous standards.”\n“The farmers already have to slow down their pace to carry the locust pesticide equipment. With the additional weight of the protective gear, their efficiency is greatly reduced.”\n“After the relevant experts examined the scene, they say that if they still can’t find a solution, the locust plague might really spin out of control!”\nThe subordinate’s words were like an invisible slap to Lin Shan’s face.\nLin Shan was a little embarrassed. She averted her gaze and lifted her chin guiltily. She stubbornly said, “Making protective gear is the only solution!”\n“If the protective gear doesn’t work, we can only blame the fact that there’s an issue with the development of the pesticide!”\n“Didn’t Qiu Tong say that she has a solution? Why don’t we listen…”\n“The Qiu family is always bragging. I wonder if what she says is true this time. Don’t tell me she will get her child to develop a new locust pesticide?”\nLin Shan gritted her teeth and glared at Qiu Tong mockingly, trying to provoke her. She wanted Qiu Tong to be blamed for everything!",

      "content": "Chapter 125: Disrespect\nMayor Shen looked at Qiu Tong worriedly, afraid that she would turn on him on the spot and Mr. Jin Yang about this matter, thus implicating his position.\nAt the same time, he did not believe that Qiu Tong would be able to think of a way to completely solve the locust pesticide problem. Mayor Shen hurriedly tried to smooth things over. “This is an important matter. We have to slowly discuss countermeasures. Miss Qiu, don’t be too rash.”\n“You can’t be blamed for this…”\nQiu Tong took out her phone with an indifferent expression and dialed the military base officer on her contact list.\nThe call was picked up after a few seconds. The officer asked happily, “Miss Qiu, are you still coming to modify aircraft today?”\nQiu Tong replied calmly, “No, I’ll give you a location later.”\n“Send the modified helicopters from the base over. I need to use them now.”\nThe officer had received Song Yan’s order in advance to follow Qiu Tong’s instructions and immediately agreed.\nLin Shan listened with widened eyes. When Qiu Tong hung up, she said mockingly, “Yo, are you trying to scare me?”\n“How can a civilian come into contact with helicopters from a military base? And they are sending it over for you to use?”\n“Who do you think you are?”\nMayor Shen and Chief Officer Fang looked at each other and similarly felt that Qiu Tong’s words could not be trusted. They were well aware of the strict protocols of military bases. If a basic-level officer was to casually deploy military aircraft, even if they were abandoned aircraft, he would be severely punished.\nHowever, when they thought of Qiu Tong’s background and status, they unanimously defended her and retorted to Lin Shan, “Miss Qiu has a high status.”\n“As long as Miss Qiu Tong says so, she must be confident of it!”\nLin Shan was stunned. She sized up Chief Officer Fang and Mayor Shen suspiciously, sensing that their attitude towards Qiu Tong was a little different.\nLin Shan seemed to have thought of something. She stared at Qiu Tong and said, “I didn’t expect you to be so capable.”\n“You managed to hook up with two high-ranking officials, the Chief Officer and the Mayor at the same time, and even have them get along so harmoniously with each other?”\n“What method did you use? Skills in bed? Or just relying on your sweet mouth?”\nLin Shan sneered sarcastically, “I need to learn from you!”\nWhen Chief Officer Fang and Mayor Shen heard Lin Shan’s nonsense, their expressions changed in fright. They stopped her with a harsh voice and reminded her, “Lin Shan! Don’t slander high-ranking government officials! Don’t slander people without thinking!” Their words were clearly hinting at something, but Lin Shan did not understand.\nA dead silence fell. Lin Shan glared at Qiu Tong angrily.\nBang!\nThe door of the room was pushed open from the outside. Shu Xian, who had been invited, rushed over a little later. He personally brought a second batch of protective gear with him. He was so stupid that he didn’t notice the abnormal atmosphere. Shu Xian skillfully picked up an empty wine glass and filled it himself. He looked at Mayor Shen and said, “Our factory has finally produced it after working overtime!”\n“The protective apparatus has solved the problems of Chief Officer Fang and Mayor Shen, but it’s a loss-making business for us.”\nShu Xian finished the red wine in his glass. He raised his hand to wipe the stain at the corner of his mouth. He pretended to mention casually. “I heard that there’s an empty space east of the city. The government has the right to use it. Its location is quite good. Our factory has been expanding recently. We just happen to need a piece of land to build a new factory.”\n“Chief Officer Fang and Mayor Shen, why don’t you help me out on this?”",

      "content": "Chapter 126: Don’t Ask For Benefits\nMayor Shen was in a very bad mood because of Lin Shan’s nonsense. Now with Shu Xian’s greedy and straightforward demand for benefits, his expression darkened.\nMayor Shen remembered that Shu Xian had received the government order through Lin Shan’s introduction. He said in a harsh and official tone, “The government has arranged for that piece of land to be used by outstanding enterprises. It can only be allocated after a bidding process and vetting the qualifications of the enterprises.”\n“We have no right to privately promise it to anyone. Mr. Shu Xian, please apply for this piece of land through proper channels.”\nShu Xian frowned. Was producing the protective apparatus not enough to give him the right to the land? He stared at Mayor Shen unhappily.\nMayor Shen pondered for a long time before reminding, “The government will be increasingly strict with the corporate governance of companies. The management of the company must abide by the law. I advise Mr. Shu Xian not to think of using nefarious methods to gain profits. Otherwise, once an investigation is carried out, we will definitely do things according to the law!”\nWhen Shu Xian heard this, he immediately nudged Lin Shan and asked in a low voice, “Didn’t you say that if we help the government we will definitely benefit in the future?”\n“They are turning against me now? What’s going on?”\nShu Xian was overwhelmed with anger and did not care that everyone at present could hear his questions. “You were the one who persuaded me to accept the order.”\n“These protective gear are not profitable at all. Hurry up and think of a way to persuade them to give me that piece of land!”\nAt the bottom of the round table, Lin Shan gently kicked Shu Xian’s feet, wanting him to shut up.\nHowever, Shu Xian did not react. Already drunk, he kept nagging at Lin Shan. She was so embarrassed that her face was flushed red. Her eyes flickered as she frowned.\nMayor Shen and Chief Officer Fang were both smart people. They immediately saw through Lin Shan’s plan. She actually dared to use the government’s crisis to benefit herself. Glaring at Lin Shan, they cleared their throats, attracting Shu Xian’s attention.\nChief Officer Fang clenched his fists and put them to his lips. He frowned and said, “Don’t say anymore!”\n“Not only is the protective gear made by the factory ineffective, it even harmed the farmers and delayed their work…”\n“As for Lin Shan, she slandered and spread rumors about government officials. I’ll keep these offences in mind for the time being. If you dare to spout nonsense again, I’ll make you account for everything!”\nMayor Shen looked at Qiu Tong’s exceptionally calm expression and said on her behalf, “As for the locust pesticide, you don’t have to interfere anymore.”\n“Miss Qiu Tong will settle it…”\nWhen Shu Xian heard this, he raised his eyebrows in disdain. He put on a ruffian stance and picked up a piece of fatty meat with his chopsticks, stuffing it into his mouth. He glanced at Qiu Tong, not believing that she could think of a solution.\n“With her status as a single mother with no backing and no business?”\n“Do you think she can solve such a big problem like the locust plague? How? With that glib tongue of hers?”\nShu Xian patted his own face and smiled. He asked, “Or with her face?”\n“Who will help her?”\nAt this moment, the sound of a helicopter came from outside the glass window of the hotel suite. Qiu Tong raised her wristwatch and calculated the time. She said calmly, “Quite punctual.” As soon as she finished speaking, Mayor Shen and Chief Officer Fang stood up in shock and disbelief. They wished they could immediately run out to take a look!\nCould Qiu Tong have really gotten the helicopter to be sent over here?",

      "content": "Chapter 127: Helicopter Slap In The Face\nIn the private room in the restaurant, an officer pushed open the door and walked straight to Qiu Tong’s side, respectfully saluting her.\nChief Officer Fang and Mayor Shen recognized the military rank on the officer’s uniform and hurriedly got up to greet him.\nHowever, the officer bypassed them and pulled open the curtains. A helicopter that was hovering in the air outside suddenly entered their line of sight!\nShu Xian and Lin Shan were gaping in shock. Chief Officer Fang and Mayor Shen were both thrown into a state of confusion by the commotion. The officer walked over to Qiu Tong and handed her the remote control. He said with a serious expression, “The helicopter has already been modified according to your specifications. It can be filled with locust pesticide and used to spray the fields at any time…”\nChief Officer Fang and Mayor Shen, “!!!”\nShu Xian and Lin Shan felt utterly humiliated, but they still forced themselves to say, “It looks very powerful. But who knows how it will be like when in actual use?”\n“When the Qiu family first developed the locust pesticide, it also looked quite formidable.”\n“What happened in the end? There were so many defects and only caused trouble for the farmers. It resolved nothing!”\nWhen Qiu Tong heard their jealous and resentful words, a mocking smile appeared on her lips. She kindly suggested. “Instead of staying here to make sarcastic remarks, why don’t you return to your factory to see the situation there?”\n“I heard that the families of the farmers who suffered from heatstroke have already surrounded the factory in protest.”\n“If things get out of hand and they charge in to destroy some important equipment, I’m afraid your losses will be magnified.”\nShu Xian and Lin Shan immediately glared at Qiu Tong resentfully. They grabbed their things and left in a hurry.\n…\nAt the villa, Qiu Tong rushed home to check on Qiu Xingyuan after settling the helicopter.\nDue to the problem with the locust pesticide, Qiu Xingyuan had locked himself up at home for several days. Every day, apart from maintaining his stamina by eating two mouthfuls of rice, he would spend the rest of the time cooped up in his room, focused on researching allergic reactions to the pesticide.\nQiu Xingqiao and Little Yu were worried about Qiu Xingyuan, so they stayed at home to accompany him.\nQiu Xingyuan was busy calculating the formula ratio in the room. Little Yu pouted and hid at the door, peeping at his back profile through the gap in the door. She quietly tugged at Qiu Xingqiao’s sleeve and said, “Second Brother, won’t Eldest Brother be very hungry?”\n“Can we bring some fruit over for him?”\nQiu Xingqiao looked at the plate of apples on the desk that had already turned dark from oxidation. He shook his head and rubbed Little Yu’s head. He tried his best to coax her, “We’ll just quietly accompany Eldest Brother. Don’t disturb him.”\nLittle Yu nodded worriedly. Qiu Xingqiao looked at the clock on the wall and pursed his thin lips. He was waiting for Qiu Tong to return.\nWhen Qiu Tong returned home, Little Yu hurriedly ran into her arms and hugged her waist.\n“Mommy, why are you back so late? Eldest Brother hasn’t come out for a long time…”\nLittle Yu’s childish voice was choked as she spoke. Qiu Tong patted the top of her head and pushed open the door to call Qiu Xingyuan out. She said seriously, “The problem regarding the allergic reactions to the pesticide has been solved. You don’t have to worry too much.”\nQiu Xingyuan raised his tired eyes and looked at Qiu Tong. “You don’t have to comfort me.”\nAlthough Qiu Xingqiao hoped that it would be as she said, his eyes were filled with suspicion and disbelief. “How did you solve it?”\nLittle Yu raised her innocent face, her eyes flickering as she asked, “Mommy, is that true?”",

      "content": "Chapter 128: Working The Fields\nQiu Tong’s phone buzzed twice and a message popped up on the screen. “The grain fields are ready. You can carry out the spraying mission anytime.”\nseeing her remain silent, Qiu Xingyuan guessed that Qiu Tong must have fabricated a lie to comfort him. He turned around to return to his room.\nQiu Tong blocked his way and looked at the time on her watch. She snapped her fingers and said, “I’ll give you 10 minutes to change your clothes. Mommy will bring you to the grain fields so that you see the solution to the problem with your own eyes! I promise you’ll be satisfied.”\nQiu Tong’s gaze landed on Qiu Xingyuan’s face. She raised her eyebrows slightly, indicating for him to believe her.\nQiu Xingyuan and Little Yu turned to look at Qiu Xingyuan. He pursed his thin lips and nodded. Perhaps he could trust her this once…\nThe three children rushed back to their room to change before gathering beside Qiu Tong.\nIn the grain fields, a heavily modified helicopter was parked at the top of the field. It was extremely eye-catching.\nThe officer, Mayor Shen and the rest were standing beside the helicopter, waiting for Qiu Tong’s arrival. The farmers were gathered not far away and discussed in low voices, “They are involving a helicopter now? They should just stop tormenting our fields.”\nWhen the Qiu family arrived at the wheat field, the three children gasped and widened their eyes in disbelief!\nQiu Xingqiao had always liked military equipment. Now that he could see it with his own eyes, he turned around excitedly and asked, “Can I touch it?”\nQiu Tong nodded with a smile. The officer brought Qiu Xingqiao into the helicopter. He touched the metal sheet and the cockpit seat, his eyes shining with joy.\nThe officer handed the remote control to Qiu Tong and reported the situation. “The spraying box has been filled with locust pesticide. It can be launched at any time.”\nQiu Tong called the three children back to her side and skillfully keyed in the locust pesticide route and procedures. With the rapid rotation of the propeller, the helicopter steadily rose into the air and sailed off. Qiu Xingyuan looked at Qiu Tong’s operation in surprise. His gaze changed from suspicion to admiration.\nSensing their gazes, Qiu Tong squatted down and explained, “These are the control buttons.”\n“Here are the buttons to control dosage and elevation. If you want the helicopter to return, press the red button.”\n“The green button will command the helicopter to stop in midair and spray heavily on areas heavily affected by the locusts.”\nQiu Xingyuan listened attentively and nodded from time to time. Qiu Tong placed the remote control in his hand and encouraged him, “Go ahead and try.”\n“Me?”\nQiu Xingyuan was a little surprised, but he realized that the officer did not stop Qiu Tong.\nQiu Tong replied firmly and gently, “That’s right. You are the one who developed the locust pesticide. Don’t worry, Mommy will help you.”\nThe two of them controlled the helicopter and sprayed the locust pesticide steadily. When the farmers witnessed the efficient operations, their resentment and anger towards the Qiu family was swept away. Instead, they started to praise the Qiu family. “Did you see that? I didn’t expect the children of the Qiu family to be such prodigies. Not only can they develop pesticides, they can also control aircraft!”\n“That’s right. Thankfully Qiu Tong was able to think of such a method to help us. It really saved us a lot of trouble!”\n“This is the first time I’ve seen someone spray locust pesticide with a helicopter. This is really an eye-opener. Qiu Tong is so awesome!”\nA peasant girl with a ponytail said enviously, “I want to work hard to become someone like her!”\nWhen Qiu Xingyuan, Qiu Xingqiao, and Little Yu heard this, they raised their proud little faces, their eyes filled with pride and joy.\nMeanwhile, the protective gear factory not far from the fields was in chaos…",

      "content": "Chapter 129: Factory Storm\nThe families of the farmers who had suffered heat stroke had gathered at the entrance of the weapons factory, sitting there cross-legged with banners raised, demanding an explanation.\nThe moment Shu Xian and Lin Shan’s car stopped, they rushed over and surrounded the two of them. They shouted loudly, “Evil enterprise!”\n“Show us the quality report of the protective gear! It must be a lousy product. It was made to fool us…”\nOne of the farmer’s wives pushed Lin Shan. She put on a fierce stance and took out her phone to shoot Lin Shan and Shu Xian. She muttered, “Everyone, look. The boss of a business which collaborated with the government. They used inferior material to make the protective gear in order to earn more profits!”\n“Expose this evil factory!”\nShu Xian and Lin Shan covered their faces with their hands and dodged wretchedly.\nSeeing that the situation was gradually spiraling out of control, Shu Xian had no choice but to compromise and say, “Go and register your personal information. I will compensate you!”\n“Will that be fine?”\nWhen they heard about compensation, the farmers’ wives exchanged looks and released their hands. They threw the banners to the ground, dusted off their clothes, and left to collect their money.\nShu Xian was in a terrible mood when he saw his cash just flying away.\nMeanwhile, the surrounding staff members complained with mocking expressions, “Boss Shu, Miss Lin Shan promised us!”\n“As long as we can complete the production of the protective gear on time, the factory will give us a bonus, as well as an increase in salary and time-off!”\n“Don’t go back on your word. Otherwise, we will also raise banners and stage a protest!”\nCheers rang out around them after the leader of the workers finished speaking. Blood surging, Shu Xian pointed at them and scolded, “Get lost, all of you get lost!”\n“Who promised you a bonus? Whoever doesn’t want to continue working, pack your things and get lost!”\nThe workers had already expected such a reaction from Shu Xian. Carrying their work hats, they returned to the factory cursing.\nShu Xian glared at Lin Shan angrily and vented all his anger on her. He scolded loudly, “It’s all your fault!”\n“Didn’t you say that working with the government will be beneficial? Where are the benefits? Not only did we not get the piece of land, I even had to pay out compensation!”\n“How unlucky. Do you know how much money I lost in this deal?”\nShu Xian was about to go crazy as he glared at Lin Shan. Lin Shan tried to shift the blame. “Actually, Mayor Shen and Chief Officer Fang wanted us to modify our protective gear and continue our collaboration. It’s Qiu Tong! I don’t know where that slut got a helicopter to go against us!”\n“She’s the one who ruined our plans!”\nLin Shan kept inciting Shu Xian. As expected, she saw an intense hatred surge in his eyes. She secretly gritted her teeth and decided to settle the score with Qiu Tong.\nMeanwhile at the grain fields, the first round of locust pesticide spraying was completed in just a few hours.\nMayor Shen and the farmers thanked Qiu Tong. Seeing that it was getting late, Qiu Tong left with the three children.\nIn the fields, Little Yu waved her arms energetically and chattered about her excitement at seeing the helicopter. “It’s so big and noisy!”\n“But Mommy is so awesome! She can control such a big aircraft!”\n“Eldest Brother is amazing too… he learned very quickly!”\nQiu Tong smiled. She could feel the changes in the children’s feelings for her.\nExtremely satisfied, she held Qiu Xingyuan’s hand. This time, Qiu Xingyuan did not break free. Instead, he gently gripped her fingers and gave a faint smile.\nAs the sun set, the four of them returned to the villa, only to see a handsome figure standing at the door.\nWhen Song Yan heard their voices, he raised his head slightly and beckoned Qiu Tong with a wicked smile. “Why are you only back now?”\n“I’m here to fulfill our promise…”",

      "content": "Chapter 130: Fulfilling The Agreement\nSong Yan raised his eyebrows lazily and winked suggestively.\nThese suggestive words instantly made the three children wary. Qiu Xingyuan immediately released Qiu Tong’s hand and pursed his thin lips to look at her in disappointment.\nQiu Xingqiao and Little Yu hurriedly ran to Qiu Tong and spread their arms wide in front of her to protect her.\nWhat agreement did they have?!\nWas Qiu Tong going to leave with him? Was today’s helicopter performance their final gift?\nThis uneasy thought lingered in the children’s minds, causing them to glare at Song Yan nervously.\nSong Yan found their reaction exceptionally interesting. He took out a brown leather token and threw it to Qiu Tong. The item flew in a perfect arc through the air and landed firmly in Qiu Tong’s arms. She opened the red seal and read the words, before looking up in surprise.\n“It’s the military base’s official seal of approval. As long as you have it, you can use the drones freely without me or the officers.”\n“This is our agreement. I’ve already done it.”\nSong Yan explained in a serious tone. The three children’s tense nerves relaxed slightly and they heaved a sigh of relief.\nQiu Xingyuan stared at him coldly. He had a nagging feeling that Song Yan had some ulterior motive towards Qiu Tong. He could not put his finger on it…\nQiu Xingqiao glared at Song Yan and muttered angrily, “You should have just gotten someone to send this lousy thing over. Why did you have to come here?”\nSong Yan shrugged. He leaned forward slightly and bent over so that his gaze was level with his. He deliberately said, “Of course I have to deliver this personally, because I need to find an opportunity to see your mommy. Who knows, we might meet more and more in the future.”\nHe smiled wickedly and winked. Qiu Xingqiao was speechless from anger at his shameless manner.\nLittle Yu stuck her hands on her hips and stomped her feet. She pouted and said, “No! We won’t allow you to see Mommy!”\nSong Yan looked at the adorable Qiu Xingyu and pretended to ask, “Why? I’ll buy you lots of candy and bring you out to play!”\nLittle Yu covered her ears with her hands and kept shaking her head. She objected. “No!”\n“We don’t like you…”\nSong Yan put on an exaggerated show of disappointment. He covered his heart with his hand, looking as if his heart had been broken into pieces.\nQiu Tong chuckled helplessly at their interaction.\nWhen Song Yan heard her laughter, his eyes flickered with interest as he said, “I didn’t even have the chance to ask last time. Where did you learn to modify the aircraft?”\nQiu Tong recalled that in her previous life, she had once used a drone to blow up the group of zombies chasing after her.\nIf she told them the truth, the three children would probably be traumatized, right?\nEspecially Little Yu. She was very timid. If she watched some scary cartoons, she would end up unable to sleep at night…\nAt the thought of this, Qiu Tong replied half-heartedly, “I usually pay attention to military matters. Perhaps I have some talent?”\n“Consider me lucky.”\nSong Yan did not believe her, but he didn’t probe further.\nA fiery red sunset appeared in the sky. Song Yan sighed deeply and said, “I might have to be away for some time.”\n“There are riots and terrorists in the neighboring province. The unrest needs to be suppressed.”\nSong Yan’s gaze landed on Qiu Tong and the three children. He reminded them in a gentlemanly manner, “You have to be careful and protect yourselves.”\n“If something happens…”\nBefore Song Yan could finish speaking, Qiu Xingyuan interrupted coldly, “It’s not your place to worry about our family matters!”",

      "content": "Chapter 131: Turn Of The Tide\nOn television, a reporter carried a camera to the grain fields. When he learned that the plague had been controlled, he praised Qiu Tong for her efforts!\n“Qiu Tong used a modified drone to spray locust pesticide. Not only did it increase efficiency, the equipment was also provided free of charge to help the farmers minimize their losses.”\n“The locust pesticide distributed by the government was developed by Qiu Tong’s eldest son, Qiu Xingyuan. He is still in kindergarten and can be considered a young genius!”\nThe news reported about Qiu Tong and her family. More and more people on the Internet were paying attention to this matter and had given them the title of “Locust Destroyer Hero”. Praise for them could be seen everywhere.\nMayor Shen wanted to throw a banquet for Qiu Tong’s family in celebration.\nQiu Tong found it too troublesome so she refused politely, “I’m afraid my children won’t have time. Thank you for your kindness.”\nMayor Shen was a little surprised, but he quickly put the matter aside and confirmed with her about the locust pesticide spraying in the next few days.\nMeanwhile, Lin Shan turned on her computer. Jealousy and resentment clouded her rationality. She gritted her teeth and opened the online forum page, registering an anonymous account to post a thread. Lin Shan uploaded a video of the kindergarten’s entrance onto the Internet. After adding some misleading words, she pressed the send button in satisfaction.\n“Qiu Tong used a modified aircraft to spray pesticide to make up for the Qiu family’s mistake!”\n“The locust pesticide developed by Qiu Xingyuan has a very serious allergen. Many farmers are still hospitalized because of the Qiu family’s pesticide.”\n“Furthermore, no one knows if the allergen will cause long-term physical side effects!”\nLin Shan propped her chin on her bright red nails and looked at the comments below the post slowly increasing. She smiled proudly as the thread went viral.\nShe wanted to see how Qiu Tong would be able to explain herself this time!\nIn an instant, the opinion on the internet changed. The red spots on the arms of many farmers were proven to be caused by usage of Qiu family’s locust pesticide.\nQiu Tong’s earlier reputation had risen too high and she was suffering a major backlash now.\nNetizens who were jealous of her started all sorts of rumors, attacking and slandering her. Even the three underage children were also implicated.\nThe rumors mixed truth and lies, confusing the rest of the public. It was easy to lead them to question the Qiu family’s original intention in helping the farmers eliminate the locusts…\nIn the villa, Qiu Xingyuan saw the comments on the internet and depressedly locked himself in his room again.\nQiu Xingqiao and Little Yu sat in the living room with worried expressions. They did not even want to watch their favorite cartoon. They only sighed quietly.\nQiu Tong saw the rumors on the internet and knew the crucial thing now was to prove Qiu Xingyuan’s innocence. To prove that there was no problem with his locust pesticide.\nOnly by solving the root cause could they eliminate all those slanders and doubts.\nQiu Tong walked to the balcony and called Mayor Shen. In just two seconds, Mayor Shen answered the call and asked, “Miss Qiu?”\n“Did you see those online rumors? I’ve already arranged…”\nQiu Tong interrupted Mayor Shen and asked in a mild voice, “A while ago, you mentioned that you would be holding a celebratory banquet? Is it going ahead as planned?”\n“Will the pharmaceutical supervisor in charge of the production of the pesticide attend?”\nMayor Shen replied seriously, “Yes. He’s the person in charge of a major component of our battle against the locusts. Of course, he will attend and make a report.”\nA comprehensive plan surfaced in Qiu Tong’s mind. She said calmly, “Please send me a few invitation cards then.”\n“I’ll bring the children to attend.”",

      "content": "Chapter 132: Going To The Banquet To Clarify\nThat night, Qiu Tong held a family meeting. When they found out that she was planning to find out the truth behind the locust pesticide allergy issue at the celebration banquet, the children were all excited.\nQiu Xingqiao said with burning eyes, “What do you need me to do? Just tell me!”\nLittle Yu nodded vigorously. She rubbed her eyes sleepily but forced herself to stay awake. “I also want to do my part for this operation!”\nQiu Tong looked at them in relief. She raised her hand to rub the top of Qiu Xingyuan’s head. She looked at Qiu Xingyuan and said, “I need you to develop a truth serum.”\n“Truth serum?”\nQiu Xingyuan narrowed his eyes and repeated the name in confusion. He had never heard of it before…\nQiu Tong pulled out two blank pieces of paper and wrote down the principles of the truth serum. She explained. “To put it simply, this is a tranquilizer that can numb the nerves in the brain. The correct dose and ratio of these ingredients will make the person speak the truth for a short period of time. There’s no way for him to fabricate a lie.”\nQiu Xingyuan listened to her summary seriously and nodded. He took the two pieces of paper back into his room and started to research the correct dose and ratio of the ingredients.\nA few days later, at the venue of the celebratory banquet, Mayor Shen, Chief Officer Fang and the rest were all there to receive interviews from the media. The scene was especially lively.\nQiu Tong was wearing a dark-colored evening gown that highlighted her graceful and charming figure. The veil on her head added to her mysterious aura.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao were both wearing well-pressed tuxedos. Holding her hand, they stepped onto the red carpet and entered the banquet hall. Little Yu was holding the hem of a princess dress. Her pink face was no different from that of a princess in a cartoon.\nThe appearance of the family of four stunned everyone present. The news reporters and guests all raised their cameras to capture a rare and eye-catching scene.\nEveryone raised their glasses to celebrate their victory in the first stage of the locust battle. Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu deliberately shifted the attention of the guests to the pharmaceutical supervisor.\n“Actually, the supervisor works the hardest. He supervises the production of the pesticide in the factory every day!”\n“Our elder brother has only provided a formula and guided the production process once. Actually, we should thank the supervisor for his efforts!”\nQiu Xingqiao kept praising the pharmaceutical supervisor to distract him. Qiu Xingqiao then nodded at Qiu Xingyuan. He secretly poured the truth serum into his wine and swirled it quietly.\nThe pharmaceutical supervisor did not expect to be the main hero. He was so happy that his mouth was agape as he said repeatedly, “You’re too kind, too kind!”\nQiu Tong raised her glass and looked at him indifferently. “Let me toast you…”\nAfter she finished speaking, she downed her red wine. Mayor Shen, Chief Officer Fang and the rest followed suit. The pharmaceutical supervisor finished the wine with the truth serum. Although he found the taste a little strange, he didn’t think too much about it and continued to chat with the surrounding people.\nAfter calculating the time for the truth serum to be effective, Qiu Xingqiao set the trap. “Uncle Supervisor is really amazing.”\n“If you hadn’t made the decision to shorten the process of making the locust pesticide, things wouldn’t have been resolved so quickly.”\n“According to Elder Brother’s method, the locust plague will probably continue to spread for some time… how did you manage to come up with a way to shorten the process?”\nQiu Xingqiao deliberately blinked innocently. The pharmaceutical supervisor was too pleased with himself. Coupled with the effects of the truth serum, he quickly confessed, “Actually, it’s nothing special. It’s just that the process of making the serum is too cumbersome. I got the workers to mix the ingredients by instinct, without needing to measure.”\n“It also took too long to filter the impurities from the pesticide. It would take an hour or two. So I got the workers to do away with the filtering process…”\nThe pharmaceutical supervisor did not sense that something was amiss and continued to speak. However, Qiu Xingyuan immediately looked at him with a cold face and frowned as he refuted, “I did not permit doing away with the filtering process. In fact, I specifically reminded you that it is very important to filter!”",

      "content": "Chapter 133: Problematic Supervisor\nWhen the pharmaceutical supervisor heard Qiu Xingyuan’s words, he was slightly shocked. His rationality told him that he had to shut up now and steer away from this matter.\nHowever, his body seemed to be out of control. He muttered to himself, “The impurities removed after each filtering was only a few grams. It’s completely negligible. What’s the point? I’m the supervisor of pharmaceutical production. Can’t I make the decision to delete it?”\n“Although you’re the inventor of the pesticide, you’re just a child. Do I have to listen to everything you say?”\n“I’ve been a pharmaceutical supervisor for more than 10 years, and I’ve never made any mistake.”\n“I can also make a profit from it by removing the filtering process. Why not?”\nThe pharmaceutical supervisor revealed all his motives for doing things. Qiu Tong was recording with her phone. Seeing his pale face, she raised the corners of her lips and said fiercely, “So you are the one who caused the locust pesticide to produce an allergic reaction.”\n“You have to bear the consequences yourself. Don’t even think about throwing the blame on me and Qiu Xingyuan!”\n“I’ll make you pay the price. You better go back and think about how you’re going to apologize and make it up to us!”\nQiu Tong glared at him before turning to leave. After the effects of the serum wore off, the pharmaceutical supervisor wished that he could give himself a few slaps. He collapsed to the ground, his legs weak.\nAlthough there were reporters at the celebration party, Qiu Tong was worried that they would be bribed by the pharmaceutical supervisor, so she decided to release the recording online.\n“Although the filtering process is complicated, it’s necessary.”\n“During the mixing process of the pesticide, there will be granular crystals that can easily cause allergies. They can be filtered out.”\n“However, due to the arbitrary actions of the pharmaceutical supervisor, the locust pesticide gave rise to extremely strong side effects and allergies…”\n“This matter has nothing to do with Qiu Xingyuan, the inventor of the pesticide. Please investigate.”\nWhen the evidence and explanation was released on the internet, Mayor Shen knew that Qiu Tong had been wronged. He also arranged for people to help promote the post.\nSoon, the farmers learned the truth. They all cursed the evil pharmaceutical supervisor while expressing their apologies to Qiu Xingyuan.\n“Although he’s just a child, he is truly capable.”\n“We looked down on a child just because he is younger than us and even made him suffer so much grievance and injustice. We owe him an apology!”\nThe topic “Apologize to Qiu Xingyuan” gradually climbed to the top of online search engines. More and more farmers started to protest, forcing the pharmaceutical supervisor to step out and apologize sincerely, acknowledging all his mistakes.\nIn the villa, Qiu Tong looked at the children who had been looking at their phones and shook her head helplessly.\nQiu Xingyuan looked at the clarification post and felt touched. He stole a glance at Qiu Tong and accidentally met her eyes. He immediately cleared his throat awkwardly and looked away. Rubbing the tip of his nose, he stood up and returned to his room.\nLittle Yu looked at his departing profile and ran over to Qiu Tong’s side. She looked up and said, “Elder Brother is very happy.”\nQiu Tong nodded. “I know.”\nMeanwhile, Lin Shan saw that the tables had turned. She couldn’t figure out why Qiu Tong was always so lucky!\nShe indignantly found the video that she had secretly recorded a few years ago. In the video, Qiu Tong was scolding the children angrily with a fierce expression… Lin Shan snorted coldly and uploaded the video onto the internet before pressing the release button.",

      "content": "Chapter 134: Mother And Children Reconcile\nThe video of Qiu Tong scolding the children firmly occupied the top trending search of all major online search engines. Many passersby reposted the video and criticized Qiu Tong’s ruthlessness.\n“Is this their biological mother? How could she bear to hit such cute children?”\n“She’s simply not fit to be a mother! I strongly request the relevant departments to investigate and strip her of her custody. Give those children a chance at a happy childhood!”\nPublic opinion suddenly changed again. Qiu Tong saw the former owner of her body in the video scolding and beating Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao with a ferocious expression, rebuking them with especially harsh words. Her heart ached. She frowned and glanced at the three small figures sitting in the living room. She wanted to go over to them but was afraid of scaring them.\nWhen Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao saw the video, their nearly-healed psychological trauma was awakened again.\nThey quietly clenched their fists and shielded Little Yu, not wanting her to see the video. Their bodies were tense and their thin lips were trembling.\n“You’re all illegitimate children. You should all die!”\n“Get lost. Don’t let me see you, eyesores…”\nQiu Tong’s cursing and swearing echoed in his ears. Qiu Xingyuan’s pupils constricted. Sensing Qiu Tong’s gaze on them from afar, he held Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu’s hands as they returned to their room. The originally harmonious relationship between the children was attacked by an anonymous video. Their relationship became awkward and distant.\n“Elder Brother, we…”\nQiu Xingqiao sat on the edge of the bed. He wanted to say that Qiu Tong seemed to have changed, but recalling the video footage, he could only hang his head low and grip the corner of the bedsheet in loneliness.\nKnock knock—\nQiu Tong made three cups of hot milk in the kitchen and placed them on a tray before knocking lightly on the door.\nLittle Yu innocently ran to Qiu Tong’s side and took the initiative to distribute the milk to Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao. She pulled Qiu Tong to sit at the desk. “Mommy, do you have something to say to us?”\nLittle Yu was very considerate. She sensed that the atmosphere was a little off.\nQiu Tong nodded and said sincerely, “Although it sounds like an excuse, Mommy regrets what she did to you…”\n“After watching the video, Mommy knows how much you’ve suffered in the past.”\n“You are all the most precious gifts from the heavens to Mommy. You are the most adorable and obedient children. Mommy owes you this apology.”\nQiu Tong’s gaze landed on Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao. She sighed and continued, “I’ll try my best to make it up to you in the future. I won’t let you suffer anymore. I also hope that you can supervise Mommy. If Mommy does anything wrong or makes you feel uncomfortable, you can tell me directly.”\n“Mommy will work hard to change.”\nLittle Yu was stunned. Her eyes were already red and moist. Qiu Tong rubbed the top of her head and asked, “Can you forgive Mommy?”\nQiu Xingyuan gritted his teeth and tried his best to maintain a stubborn and cold expression, but his eyes were also red.\nQiu Xingqiao was able to maintain his stance at first, but when he heard Qiu Tong say “I’m sorry”, his tears flowed uncontrollably. He could only keep wiping his tears with his hands.\nLittle Yu nodded vigorously and threw herself into Qiu Tong’s arms. She cried, “Yes! Little Yu doesn’t blame Mommy anymore!”\nQiu Xingqiao also grunted twice to show his assent.\nQiu Tong took a deep breath and pulled the three children into her arms, hugging them tightly.\nNo matter how strong Qiu Xingyuan was, he could not help crying weakly at this moment. The barrier between mother and son completely dissolved at this moment.\nQiu Tong could feel the children’s dependence and warmth. Her eyes turned red as she secretly swore to protect their happy lives from harm and bullying.",

You don’t have to worry about it.”\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao exchanged glances. They waited for Qiu Tong to turn in for the night before bringing Little Yu to the living room for an emergency meeting.\nThe three children were dressed in their pajamas and huddled quietly on the sofa. They frowned when they saw Qiu Tong’s video spreading online.\nLittle Yu finally understood why her siblings were behaving so strangely. She pouted and suggested, “Why don’t I hack the video and delete it?”\n“I just need to modify and block the source code of the video. No one will be able to view the video on the website!”\n“I can also remove all the trending searches online. It will be a very simple task… I can do everything quickly!”\nLittle Yu said confidently. Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao also felt that the method was feasible.\nJust as the two of them were about to nod at her to confirm the details, they heard light footsteps coming from the darkness.\nQiu Xingyuan immediately stopped talking. Qiu Xingqiao glared fiercely at Ye Luan, who had just come out of the room. He put his index finger to his lips and said, “Shh!”\n“Don’t let some annoying fellow overhear our plan!”\nYe Luan had been feeling a little thirsty and was about to go to the kitchen to fetch water. This was when he chanced upon the children discussing. When he heard Qiu Xingqiao’s hostile words, he stood in front of the water dispenser with an indifferent expression. He did not speak up to defend himself.\nIn the dim light of the living room, all four children had different expressions. The atmosphere was a little comical.\nQiu Xingqiao clenched his fists and muttered angrily, “Perhaps he came out on purpose just to make fun of us.”\n“He must have seen the video online…”\nWhen Ye Luan heard Qiu Xingqiao’s conjecture, he turned around and interrupted him coldly. With an indifferent expression, he reminded him, “Although I have no intention of participating in your plan, I am nice enough to advise you not to delete the original video.”\n“Although deleting the video can temporarily reduce discussion about this, it might cause more serious misunderstandings. People might think that Auntie Qiu is deliberately hiding the truth.”\n“The netizens’ attitude towards her will become even worse. What you need to do is to solve the problem from the root. For example… you need to personally respond and clarify things.”\nYe Luan was grateful for Qiu Tong’s care. After he finished his suggestion, he turned around and returned to his room, closing the door with a bang.\nThe three children had conflicted expressions after being scolded by him.\nQiu Xingqiao frowned and retorted in a hoarse voice, “We know that too. There’s no need for him to tell us!”\n“He’s just a few years older than us, but already knows how to put on airs! Hmph…”\nQiu Xingyuan sat silently at the side. Instead, it was Little Yu who quietly tugged at Qiu Xingqiao’s sleeve. She said in a small voice, “Second Brother, Brother Ye Luan seems to be making sense. Even if we delete the existing videos, someone might release more.”\n“Why don’t we record a video to clarify things?”\nLittle Yu stared at Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao with sparkling eyes. They looked a little awkward and did not answer, but in their hearts, they had already tacitly approved of this plan of action.\nQiu Xingyuan took the initiative to find a suitable location to record the video. Little Yu ran quietly around the living room to fetch the necessary things. Qiu Xingyuan adjusted the height of the camera.\nThe three children were ready and Qiu Xingyuan pressed the start button.",

When Jin Yang saw that the locust plague had been controlled and the farmers were praising Qiu Tong, his eyes were filled with admiration.\nQiu Tong seemed to always be able to surprise him.\nJin Yang smiled and stared at the photo of Qiu Tong standing in the grain fields. He zoomed in with his fingertips and looked at it carefully. He then scrolled down the screen.\nA news item related to Qiu Tong suddenly popped up—”Shocking! The Locust Destroyer Hero is actually a vicious mother who abuses her children!”\nJin Yang frowned as he searched for related topics and videos. He realized that this news had already climbed to the top of the search rankings.\nHis eyes were chilly, and his handsome face was covered in a terrifying coldness.\n“Come in.”\nJin Yang called Shao An over on the intercom. He wanted him to settle this.\nHowever, before Shao An made his move, another news item popped up. It was another video. The thumbnail was the adorable faces of Qiu Xingyuan, Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu. As if controlled by someone, this video quickly squeezed out the previous video of Qiu Tong abusing the children to occupy the headlines.\nIn the video, Qiu Xingyuan faced the camera like a little adult. Qiu Xingqiao coughed nervously twice, while Little Yu smiled sweetly.\nAlthough the three children’s attitudes were different on camera, their expressions were confident and bright. There was no sign of them being threatened.\nLittle Yu faced the camera and spoke first, “Recently, there have been many crooked and ugly videos of Mommy on the internet. We really can’t bear to watch anymore!”\n“Mommy is very good to us, even though it’s her first time being a mother and she is still learning how to take care of us…”\n“We would quarrel and throw tantrums sometimes, but Mommy is not a demon!”\nQiu Xingyuan pursed his thin lips and said seriously, “If there are any more malicious rumors slandering us, we will take legal action to pursue the perpetrators. I hope that everyone can view the truth objectively and not be fooled.”\nQiu Xingqiao nodded vigorously in agreement. “Elder Brother and Little Yu are right.”\nLittle Yu took out the things beside her and displayed them in front of the camera. She said, “This is the computer Mommy gave me, the wooden stakes for Second Brother, and test tubes for Eldest Brother. Eldest Brother developed the locust pesticide with these things.”\n“Mommy is very supportive of our hobbies. She would rather starve herself to take care of us!”\nLittle Yu pursed her lips and pretended to look pitiful as she added, “Mommy took care of us alone and spent all her savings buying gifts for us. We don’t have any money now! Everyone, don’t misunderstand her anymore. Stop making wild guesses and slandering her!”\n“Mommy is the best mommy in the world!”\nQiu Xingyu spoke confidently. When the netizens saw the video, they all left comments. “These three children are really too adorable!”\n“Recently, there’s been a new technology used to synthesize fake videos. Perhaps the video of Qiu Tong abusing the children is a fake!”\n“That’s right. If Qiu Tong really doesn’t treat the children well, they won’t have come forward to clarify. Besides, have you guys noticed the light in these children’s eyes? They’re obviously very confident and happy!”\nQiu Xingyu looked at the comments and happily held up the phone screen in front of Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao. “Success!”",

      "content": "Chapter 137: Difference In Treatment\nEven through the screen, Jin Yang still felt a strong sense of intimacy with the children.\nA warm smile surfaced in Jin Yang’s eyes as he repeatedly played the children’s video. He even paused to carefully observe their expressions.\nShao An cleared his throat and asked, “Mr. President, do I still need to go and settle this?”\nJin Yang looked at the online discussion about the children’s video and felt that it had been effective. He said, “No need.”\nThe study room was a little quiet. Shao An stole a glance at Jin Yang’s expression and guessed that he must be in a very good mood now.\nAfter all, Jin Yang had never behaved so abnormally in the past. It seemed that Jin Yang would behave a little out-of-character when it came to Qiu Tong or the Qiu family.\nShao An sighed quietly. He had no power to complain about the president’s personal affairs. As a lowly official, he had no choice but to obey his orders. “Yes, Mr. President.”\nJin Yang narrowed his eyes and raised his head to meet his gaze. Shao An nearly choked and cleared his throat, hurriedly shifting his gaze elsewhere.\n“Take a trip to S City. Find Qiu Tong and rent those modified helicopters from her.”\n“The method of spraying locust pesticide using remote-controlled aircraft is very good. Although the locust plague in S City is under control, the locust plague in other cities in the country is still spreading.”\n“Go and settle it…”\nJin Yang instructed in a mild tone. He personally wrote out a cheque for a considerable rental fee and handed it to Shao An.\nShao An looked at the numbers in shock and swallowed hard. He stole a glance at Jin Yang’s stern profile and asked softly, “Mr. President, is this because you heard that the children are in need of money recently? Is that why you want to use this method to give them some money?”\n“Even so, isn’t this sum of money a little too much?”\n“If this gets out, will other officials speculate about your relationship with Ms. Qiu Tong? Wouldn’t that be bad?”\nShao An spoke without thinking. The more he spoke, the more excited he became. He did not notice that Jin Yang’s expression was turning colder.\n“Mr. President, what do you think…?”\nA chill ran down Shao An’s spine. He finally stopped talking and looked at Jin Yang with an awkward smile.\nJin Yang tapped his slender fingers on the table and stared at Shao An. “How long have you been working for me?”\nShao An was so frightened that he stuttered and did not reply. Jin Yang raised his eyes and said in a light tone, “I think you have forgotten your place and status. Control your mouth. I hate noisy and nosy people the most, understand?”\n“Yes, Sir!”\nShao An hurriedly grabbed the cheque and rushed out the door. After he left Jin Yang’s line of sight, he patted his chest and muttered, “I was nearly scared to death!”\nThe next morning, Qiu Tong woke up and checked her phone for messages. She was shocked to find hundreds of notifications.\n“Support for single mother, Qiu Tong, you can do it!”\n“Don’t be affected by the comments on the internet. You must live well with the children!”\n“If you don’t mind, I have some children’s clothes for Little Yu to wear…”\nQiu Tong looked at the countless heartwarming comments and followed their description to find the three children’s clarification video. Her heart warmed.\nAt the dining table, Qiu Tong looked at the three children, who were waiting for her reaction. She raised the fruit juice in her hand and said gently, “Mommy was very touched to see the video you made for me. Thank you!”\nQiu Xingyuan, Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu grinned.\nDing dong—\nA knock on the door disrupted this warm moment. They turned their heads at the same time, confusion flashing across their eyes.",

      "content": "Chapter 138: Communication\nQiu Tong opened the door and saw Shao An standing outside in his uniform. She asked in surprise, “Didn’t you go on a mission?”\nSong Yan had once said that Shao An was going on a rather important mission. Could it be that it had already ended?\nQiu Tong was silently speculating in her heart. Hearing her words, Shao An was stunned for a moment. “How did you know?”\nShao An recalled that he had once told Mayor Shen about his whereabouts at the kindergarten award ceremony. He mistakenly thought the Mayor must have mentioned this to Qiu Tong. He nodded and replied, “I came here this time to borrow a modified remote-controlled aircraft from you. We want to use it on a large scale in the neighboring city.”\n“Of course, we will pay you to rent it. We won’t let you work for nothing.”\n“This is a cheque. If you don’t think the amount is suitable, I can go back and discuss it with my boss…”\nShao An handed over the cheque and quietly observed the change in Qiu Tong’s expression. He originally thought that she would be surprised or excited to see such a large sum of money, but on the contrary, Qiu Tong looked up at Shao An with a strange expression. She did not agree.\nDid she think that it was too little money?\nShao An was surprised. Meanwhile, Qiu Tong was just thinking that it was all thanks to Song Yan that she was able to access the aircraft at the abandoned military base in the first place.\nWithout Song Yan’s help, she would not have been able to do all this, much less resolve the public controversy surrounding the locust plague and locust pesticide.\n“I won’t accept your money. I haven’t even thanked you for this.”\n“If you need the aircraft, feel free to use it…”\nShao An looked at the cheque in a daze and asked in confusion, “Thank us?”\nQiu Tong nodded, reminding Shao An of the things to take note of when using the aircraft. “He should know this. The weight of the pesticide cannot exceed the limit. Otherwise, he must strengthen the container first. I had no suitable parts so I didn’t do it.”\n“Alright.”\nShao An agreed but he was thinking to himself. The president knew how to repair planes?\nAnd how did Qiu Tong know this?!\n“If there’s nothing else, I’ll go back first.”\nShao An saw that the matter was settled. Before leaving, he stopped and turned to look at Qiu Tong. He asked, “Do you have anything to say to my boss?”\nQiu Tong frowned and asked in confusion, “We meet often. What’s there to talk about?”\nShao An was rather surprised. Mr. Jin Yang had been staying in the capital to handle government affairs over the recent period…\nImmediately, Shao An heard the sound of television coming from the villa. He suddenly thought that Qiu Tong had said that she often saw Jin Yang on the news. He did not ponder further and just said, “My boss will come to S City in 10 days’ time.”\nQiu Tong nodded, her face completely impassive.\nSeeing that she did not look forward to his return at all, Shao An strode out of the villa in resignation.\nHe sat in the car and drove towards the military base, quietly feeling sorry for Jin Yang. Although the president didn’t say it, Shao An realized that Jin Yang would repeatedly watch Qiu Tong and the children’s videos to relieve his longing. But what about Qiu Tong?\nShe did not miss Jin Yang at all. She was living very happily with the three children.\n“Sigh, I’m afraid boss will be disappointed!”\nShao An muttered to himself and shook his head as he looked at the scenery outside the window. The corners of his lips could not help but curl into a smile.",

      "content": "Chapter 139: Storing Food\nIn S City, Qiu Tong summoned a few mercenaries to accompany her to the market to purchase a large amount of food and daily necessities.\nThe locust plague affected the prices of grain and other necessities. All the signboards outside the shops in the market indicated a 20% increase in price. Qiu Tong entered and asked the boss to bring out his grain. After carefully checking that there were no problems with the grain, she paid without any hesitation.\nWhen the surrounding customers saw Qiu Tong hoarding food, they couldn’t help asking, “Why are you buying so much food?”\n“The locust plague is already under control. There’s enough food supply now.”\nQiu Tong smiled politely and gestured at the mercenaries to move the food back. She did not explain further.\nAs she had once lived in the post-apocalyptic era, Qiu Tong was extremely sensitive to danger. No matter what the situation, she always wanted to stock up on food and daily necessities, to guard against special situations which could happen any time. Furthermore, the locust plague in S City had just passed and the city was still in a fragile state.\nQiu Tong had four children to take care of and she needed to be fully prepared.\nThe mercenaries carried the bags of food to the car. Qiu Tong’s purchase attracted a crowd.\nWhen Shu Yuanwei heard about it, he also rushed over to check on the situation.\nHe realized that Qiu Tong was actually willing to pay a high price to buy some old grain. Shu Yuanwei couldn’t help putting his hands on his hips and sneering. “You’re really crazy.”\n“The government will definitely give you a monetary reward for helping to exterminate the locusts, right? Why do you have to buy so much food?”\nShu Yuanwei looked at Qiu Tong contemptuously, mocking her stupidity. He reminded her in a sharp tone, “In another week, the fields will be ready for harvest. By then, the price of grain will decrease and there will be a lot of fresh grain sent to the market. Why don’t you keep the money…”\n“Don’t tell me you prefer stale grain? I did hear of some people who don’t enjoy fresh food.”\nShu Yuanwei watched as Qiu Tong ignored him and left with her food. He spat on the ground. “Pui!”\n“Despicable fellow, she deserves to have her money wasted!”\nShu Yuanwei was so angry that his face turned pallid. He cursed a few times in the street before returning to his own shop.\nOn the way back to the villa, Qiu Tong and the mercenaries discovered that there were many refugees fleeing from other cities and countryside.\nThey occupied public places like parks and beside the ATM machines.\nQiu Tong frowned and asked softly, “When did this situation start to happen?”\nThe mercenary thought carefully and looked around warily before replying, “I think sometime in the past two weeks.”\n“In the beginning, only a small number of refugees moved to the center of S City. But now, nearly every part of the city has refugees gathered.”\nThe mercenaries had never seen such a situation before. Their tone was somewhat solemn.\nThe more Qiu Tong heard, the more uneasy she felt. She knew that other cities would not be as lucky as S City to be able to use a helicopter to spray locust pesticide to control the situation.\nIf they missed the optimal locust extermination time, the locusts in the fields would easily go out of control and consume the grains before harvest.\nFaced with such a situation, those farmers who relied on selling food for a living had no choice but to flee their homes and beg on the streets…\nQiu Tong had experienced riots caused by a lack of food in the post-apocalyptic era. She immediately sped up and urged the mercenaries, “Hurry.”\n“Let’s hurry back.”",

      "content": "Chapter 140: Refugees Blocking The Road\nA week later, the harvesting of the grain fields was completed.\nThe Shu food store made a killing by buying at a low price and reselling at a higher price.\nShu Yuanwei was exceptionally pleased as he counted the bills. He recalled that Shu Xian’s factory seemed to have encountered some trouble recently. His eyes darted around as he dialed Shu Xian’s number. After learning that he was drinking alone at home, he immediately said, “Wait for me! I’ll go over and have a drink with you now!”\nEager to show off, Shu Yuanwei carried two bottles of good wine and headed to the villa district in his fur coat.\nOutside the gate of the villa area, refugees and beggars from other places were gathered in front of the greenery by the road. When they saw Shu Yuanwei, their eyes lit up and they ran over. They blocked Shu Yuanwei’s path and clasped their hands together, begging, “Please show mercy!”\n“We haven’t eaten in days!”\n“Please show some charity and let us fill our stomachs…”\nThe beggars and refugees’ clothes were tattered and their bodies exuded an unpleasant smell. This made Shu Yuanwei take two steps back in disgust. He pinched his nose and waved his hand. “Get lost, a good dog knows not to block the way! Get lost, don’t ruin my good mood!”\nShu Yuanwei wanted to walk forward, but a female refugee mustered up the courage to hug his calf. Her dirty face was filled with despair.\n“Please give us something to eat. Our child is still young and hasn’t eaten for a few days.”\n“He’ll die if he keeps starving like this.”\nIn front of a trash can by the side of the road, a skinny child was wrapped in tattered clothes. He looked to be about two or three years old. His skin was sallow and his breathing was slow. He looked like he was sick. Shu Yuanwei did not show any sympathy. He lifted his leg and kicked the woman, cursing as he dusted off his leg. “How unlucky.”\n“You dirtied my clothes. My pants are very expensive, can you afford to compensate me?”\nAnother refugee, who looked like the woman’s husband, saw Shu Yuanwei’s vicious actions. He hurriedly rushed to her side and stared at Shu Yuanwei venomously, wanting to snatch the good wine and roasted chicken from his hands.\nBut they were refugees and their bodies were weak. How could they be a match for Shu Yuanwei?\nShu Yuanwei suddenly lifted his leg and kicked the man’s arm. He cursed as he continued to hit him. “You bunch of trash should just die!”\n“You even dare to come to this villa district? Do you know where this is?”\n“You all smell so bad. You are just a bunch of foreign dogs. You should have been kept outside. Even if you die, don’t come to our doorsteps to die. You’re an eyesore!”\nShu Yuanwei continued to beat up the refugee. The woman cried and begged him to have mercy, but he had no intention of stopping.\nQiu Tong had just returned from the kindergarten to fetch the children when she happened to pass by and saw the scene. She frowned and shouted. “Stop!”\n“Who do you think you are? I can hit whoever I want. Why are you stop me?”\nBeads of sweat formed on Shu Yuanwei’s forehead. He rolled up his sleeves, wanting to make a move on Qiu Tong. However, just as his arm was about to reach her, Qiu Tong grabbed his wrist and twisted it downwards forcefully. The clear sound of bones breaking could be heard.\n“Ouch, it hurts!”\nShu Yuanwei wailed and squatted down. He kept trying to smack away Qiu Tong’s hand, but still stubbornly said, “Stop being a busybody!”\n“Let go of me. I didn’t provoke you…”\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes. She didn’t want to be entangled with Shu Yuanwei any longer, so she let go of him and dusted off her hands in disgust. “Leave now!”",

      "content": "Chapter 141: Future Chaos\nShu Yuanwei staggered to his feet and ran towards the villa district without looking back.\nHugging her child, the female refugee thanked Qiu Tong repeatedly. Qiu Tong noticed that the group of refugees and beggars behind her were looking at Shu Yuanwei with resentment and viciousness. Secretly alarmed by this, she quickly took out some food and distributed it to them. “You better leave this place as soon as possible.”\n“Bring the children to a warmer place.”\nQiu Tong looked at a burly refugee staring at the food and frowned at him, “You’re not allowed to call anyone else to come over here.”\n“Our food is limited. We don’t have any more excess food to give you, understand?”\nThe refugees and beggars did not answer. They just hurriedly grabbed some food and stuffed it into their mouths. Their actions and expressions reminded Qiu Tong of the post-apocalyptic chaos. She hurried home in a panic and closed all the doors and windows of the villa. She drew the curtains and extinguished all the bright lights in the room.\nQiu Tong then hid behind the curtain and saw the refugees and beggars rushing towards the row of villas.\n“That woman from just now lives in that direction!”\n“She must still have some food. If we find her, we can survive a few more days!”\nThey wanted to beg for more food from Qiu Tong. Occasionally, they would stop and re-orientate themselves, searching for Qiu Tong’s residence, gradually approaching…\nThe leader of the beggars narrowed his eyes and examined the villas one by one. He said in a hoarse voice, “Continue to search!”\nQiu Tong immediately understood that this group of beggars must have run out of other areas in S City to beg for food!\nAlthough the situation in S City was better than in other cities, the locust plague still affected the farmers and food production here to a certain extent!\nThere had still been a sudden decrease in the production of grains. The households in S City only managed to maintain their own food reserves, and none had any surplus food to give to the refugees and beggars.\nThe refugees outside the city were famished and cold. They were already on the verge of death, so it was inevitable that their emotions and actions would go to the extreme.\nWhen they saw that the citizens of S City had food and accommodation, and could even live in warm houses, they would definitely feel unbalanced.\nUnresolvable conflicts would gradually accumulate and eventually erupt, creating chaos.\nQiu Tong drew the curtains tightly and murmured, “The city is going to be in chaos.”\nQiu Tong received a call from the kindergarten teacher in the evening. “Hello? Is this Mother Qiu?”\n“It hasn’t been very peaceful in S City recently. There have been many cases of refugees causing trouble. As the children don’t have the ability to protect themselves, we have decided to temporarily close the kindergarten for the next few days.”\n“You don’t have to send the children to kindergarten for the next few days. As for homework and classes, our teacher will contact you again.”\nQiu Tong frowned and replied softly, “Thank you, Teacher.”\n“I’ll take care of the children. You be careful too.”\nShe hung up the phone and looked back at Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu, who were sitting quietly in the living room watching cartoons. Her eyes darkened.\nQiu Xingyuan walked out from his bedroom. He overheard Qiu Tong’s conversation with the kindergarten teacher. He pursed his thin lips and asked with a serious expression, “Did something happen outside?”\n“Is it because of those refugees outside?”\nQiu Xingyuan did not deliberately lower his voice. Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu heard his words over their cartoon and ran over in a panic. They asked Qiu Tong, “Mommy, are there bad people outside?”",

      "content": "Chapter 142: Elimination\nThe atmosphere in the villa was tense and heavy. Little Yu followed Qiu Tong nervously and fearfully, refusing to let go of her fingers.\nQiu Tong sensed their emotions and comforted the children gently. “It’s alright, Mommy will accompany you here.”\n“Even if bad people dare to come here, Mommy will beat them back!”\nQiu Tong picked up two fairy tale books from the bookshelf and pointed to the bedroom. “Now, all good children should be in bed now. Mommy will read you a story, okay? Who wants to hear a fairy tale?”\nLittle Yu immediately raised her hand. Qiu Xingqiao said in a low voice, “We don’t want to hear stories about princesses and princes anymore. We want to hear stories about heroes…”\nQiu Tong burst out laughing. She was moved by the children’s innocence and carried them back to the bedroom. She coaxed them, “Alright, as you please.”\nHalf an hour later, Qiu Tong came out of the bedroom quietly and closed the door.\nShe wanted to go to the kitchen to have a drink of water, but realized that Ye Luan was sitting on the sofa in the darkness. In the dim light, his small figure looked a little lonely.\nQiu Tong noticed his envy and took the initiative to sit beside him. She asked, “Do you want Auntie Qiu to read you a story too?”\n“Are you afraid too?”\nYe Luan frowned awkwardly and rejected coldly, “I’m not a child.”\nQiu Tong raised her eyebrows and deliberately slowed her movements as she stood up. “In that case, I’ll go back to my room first. Goodnight…”\nThe moment her figure brushed past Ye Luan, Ye Luan suddenly raised his hand and grabbed the corner of her clothes. He bit his thin lips and didn’t say anything.\nYe Luan lowered his eyes, his long eyelashes blocking his eyes. No one could tell what he was feeling.\nQiu Tong gave a small smile and sighed as she sat beside him. She hugged Ye Luan and whispered, “Auntie Qiu won’t read you any stories then. I’ll just sit with you for a while. You don’t have to be afraid. In Auntie Qiu’s heart, you’re also my child just like Qiu Xingyuan and the rest. You’re a very good child.”\nYe Luan’s emotions surged when he heard this.\nThe estrangement between the two of them dissolved that night, and their hearts became even closer.\n…\nEarly next morning, the sounds of glass being smashed outside could be heard. The ear-piercing noise woke Qiu Tong from her sleep.\nShe quickly got up to take a look and realized that there were refugees gathered outside. They were attacking the guards of the villa in an organized manner, picking up stones and smashing them against glass. They even tried to break through the fences and barge into the guards’ area with ferocious momentum.\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes. She noticed that there seemed to be many gangsters from the city mixed among these refugees…\n“The unrest has begun!”\nQiu Tong drew the curtains and asked Ke Le and the others to gather in the room. “From now on, your priority is to protect the children!”\nQiu Tong looked at Qiu Xingyuan and Ye Luan and instructed, “You two are the big brothers, you have to protect your younger siblings.”\n“All of you have to stay obediently in the villa. Don’t run around and don’t go out, understand?”\nQiu Tong stared at the situation outside and said with a calm and solemn expression, “According to the intensity of their attacks now, the electric fence around the villa should be able to hold on for a while. They won’t be able to break in for the time being, but we still have to make preparations and take early precautions!”",

      "content": "Chapter 143: Activation Of Electric Fence\nThe rioting in S City was fierce. The police station immediately activated an emergency plan and mobilized the police.\nHowever, there were too many refugees surging into the city and they were joined by unemployed city-dwellers who were out to create trouble. The police officers could not suppress or control them at all.\nReporters from the television station risked their lives to report live from the streets. News about the cruel and chaotic streets quickly spread.\nAt the official residence in the capital, Jin Yang looked at the television screen with unprecedented nervousness. His entire body was tense as he stared at every figure that flashed across the screen, as if he was looking for someone. It was only when the signal on the screen stopped that Jin Yang heaved a sigh of relief and relaxed his clenched fists.\n“Shao An, come here.”\nJin Yang called Shao An on the intercom, who rushed over in his uniform. “Mr. President, what can I do for you?”\n“Postpone everything on my to-do list…”\n“Prepare the helicopter immediately. I want to go to S City. Now, now!”\nJin Yang pursed his thin lips into a straight line. “What are you waiting for?”\nJust as Shao An was feeling puzzled, he saw the image of a riot flashing on the television. He nervously stopped him and said, “Sir, security in S City is very bad now. Your personal safety be at risk. It’s very likely that someone will take advantage of the chaos to attack you. Why don’t you wait for news in the capital?”\n“I can bring my men to handle it. Once the situation is under control, you can go over to see them.”\nShao An suggested a solution that he thought was feasible. Jin Yang frowned and walked up to him. He asked coldly, “Is it your place to teach me how to do things?”\n“Why don’t I let you be the president too? Go and make the arrangements now!”\nShao An’s persuasion was fruitless. He could only obey orders and arrange for a helicopter. Jin Yang disguised himself and rushed to S City. He looked at Shao An, who was following him, and said, “You stay.”\n“If they know that I’m going to S City, problems will definitely crop up.”\n“Stay in the official residence and distract them. Take care of the government affairs for me and suppress the news. No more problems can be allowed to happen!”\nShao An nodded silently. He was already used to Jin Yang’s behavior when facing Qiu Tong’s problems.\n“Be safe, Sir.”\nShao An watched as the helicopter flew towards S City. He quickly returned to the official residence and ordered everyone to keep Jin Yang’s departure a strict secret.\nIn the villa district, the refugees and beggars became increasingly anxious. They even wanted to break through the electric fence with brute force. A few agile escapees had already climbed onto the fence and were using tools to destroy it.\n“Mommy, will they be able to break in?”\nLittle Yu hugged Qiu Tong’s waist tightly in fear as she asked in a trembling voice. Her little face was ashen from fright, and her eyes were filled with panic and fear.\nQiu Tong frowned and watched the intruders with a serious expression. She had no choice but to carry Little Yu to the electrical switch box at the door and turn on the switch.\nSizzle! Pop—\nThe electric fence was instantly shot through with electricity and all the escapees who were climbing onto it were electrocuted. Their limbs went numb, and they lost consciousness as they fell to the ground. Their limbs twitched incessantly, and some of them even foamed at the mouth as their breathing quickened.\nThis scene frightened the other refugees so much that they retreated one by one, staring at the electric fence in front of the villa in horror.\nThe leader of the refugees did not expect Qiu Tong to set up such a vicious defensive device.\n“There’s… there’s electricity on it?”\nThe timid and cowardly refugees helped the severely injured escape to the back and raised their trembling hands. “We can’t go in, what should we do?”",

      "content": "Chapter 144: Begging For Mercy\n“There are no electric fences in the neighboring villas. We can go and rob them!”\nThe refugees realized that the other villas were more vulnerable. Their eyes lit up as they pointed at the Shu family’s villas and shouted, “Let’s go to those over there!”\nQiu Tong saw that there were only a few injured refugees resting on the ground outside. Most of the other refugees were already attacking and seizing the food stores from the other villas.\nShe could not help frowning and sighing. “The worst has indeed happened.”\nQiu Tong muttered, “I’m afraid our electric fence won’t be able to hold for long. After they rob all the food from the other villas, they will definitely return…”\nShe watched as the refugees used metal rods and stones to smash the Shu family’s door. She could not help commenting. “They deserve it.”\nMeanwhile, the Shu family’s villa was breached by the refugees in just a few minutes. They barged in like bandits and plundered the food stores.\nShu Xian and Shu Yuanwei were originally drunk, but they were so frightened that they instantly sobered up. They squatted on the ground, clutching their heads and trembling.\nLin Shan screamed and hid on the sofa. She covered her body with a pillow and flailed around shouting, “Don’t come over! I’m calling the police!”\nWhen the leader of the refugees heard this, his expression turned gloomy and he looked very unhappy.\nShu Xian and Shu Yuanwei secretly cursed Lin Shan for being too stupid. They hurriedly raised their hands and said, “As you can see, we don’t have much food at home. There’s not enough for you to eat. Even if you turn the villa upside down, this is all there is!”\n“We don’t dare to lie to you. But I know who has more food!”\nShu Yuanwei recalled the grains that Qiu Tong had hoarded. He tried to sell her out to the refugee leader in exchange for his trust.\n“She just bought several carts of food a few days ago. She must have stored them at home. They’re not far away. I can bring you there!”\nShu Xian saw the expressions of the refugees relax a little. He hurriedly nodded and said, “Yes, yes! Even if you keep wasting time here, you won’t get anything.”\nThe leader of the refugees frowned. After some thought, he arranged for a few of his subordinates to escort Shu Yuanwei and let him lead the way.\nThe group of refugees returned to the entrance of the Qiu family villa in a swaggering manner. Shu Yuanwei pointed at the electric fence and said excitedly and ingratiatingly, “It’s this one! Just go in and rob them. You’ll definitely be able to get a lot of things…”\nBang! Smack!\nAs soon as Shu Yuanwei finished speaking, the leader of the refugees grabbed his head and swung his fist at his abdomen, causing him to spit out blood.\nSeveral beat Shu Yuanwei with sticks until he could not get up. He wretchedly begged for mercy. “Stop beating me, stop beating me!”\n“Pui! Are you trying to trick us?”\n“This villa is clearly fortified. Didn’t you see our fallen brothers? They were all electrocuted just now!”\nThe leader of the refugees spoke in a hoarse voice. Shu Yuanwei did not expect things to turn out this way. He felt an unbearable pain in his abdomen and quickly tugged at the refugee’s pants. In a weak voice, he said, “I have a solution! I can help you break in and bring out the food.”\n“Stop. Listen to what he has to say…”\nThe leader of the refugees raised his hand. Shu Yuanwei staggered and got up. He pointed at a small house outside the villa area and coughed. “That’s the villa district’s main power supply room. As long as we cut off the power from the villa area, the electric fence won’t work.”\n“Without the electric fence, it will be very easy for you to break in.”\n“There’s only one woman and a few children in that villa. They are no match for you.”\nShu Yuanwei pleaded. The leader of the refugees pondered for a while and nodded. “Okay.”",

      "content": "Chapter 145: Cutting Off The Power\nLed by Shu Yuanwei, the refugees and beggars headed straight to the main power supply room of the villa district. They used brute force to subdue the security guards on duty.\nShu Yuanwei wanted to interrogate them on which switch to cut off the power supply to Qiu Tong’s villa. But the leader of the refugees directly cut off the power supply to the entire area.\nIn an instant, the affluent villa district fell into a state of panic. The residents hid in the basement, trying to avoid the disaster in front of them.\nQiu Tong noticed something amiss and ran to the window with a frown. She saw the leader of the refugees surrounding her villa with a large group of people.\nKe Le stood beside her and said in a hoarse and rough voice, “Boss, don’t worry.”\n“With us here, we will protect you and the children with our lives!”\nQiu Tong looked at him gratefully and patted his shoulder. She picked up the metal rod and other items she had prepared in advance. “You guys be careful too!”\n“I don’t want anyone to get hurt, understand?”\nThe mercenaries nodded solemnly and guarded the door with serious expressions. They pricked up their ears to listen to the approaching footsteps.\nWith danger approaching, Ye Luan took the initiative to run to Qiu Tong with clenched fists. He raised his thin little hand and shielded her behind him.\nQiu Tong looked down at him in confusion. Ye Luan pursed his lips and said softly, “I’m a man. I have to protect Auntie Qiu when there is danger!”\nQiu Xingqiao put on a stoic face when he heard his words. He gripped his boxing gloves tightly and stood in front of Ye Luan and Qiu Tong. “She’s my mommy. It’s not your place to protect her! Go and find a place to hide. Just don’t cause trouble for us…”\nThis was the first time Little Yu was experiencing a riot like this. She was very frightened and feeling somewhat panicky, but she still chose to run in front of Qiu Tong.\nQiu Xingyuan filled up the last empty spot in front of Qiu Tong. He frowned nervously and looked at Qiu Tong worriedly. “Don’t move!”\nQiu Tong looked at the children who were protecting her and felt a warmth in her heart.\n“Thank you.”\nShe muttered under her breath before grabbing the children by their waists and handing them to the mercenaries behind her. “Protect them!”\nThe mercenaries obeyed the order and surrounded the four children in the middle. They listened warily to the sounds of the refugees crashing through the door and smashing the windows…\nBang! Crack——\nThe refugees barged into the villa and saw Qiu Tong and Ke Le standing side by side. The leader of the refugees narrowed his eyes and said, “Hand over your food!”\n“I promise they won’t hurt you.”\nQiu Tong glanced at the crowd and quickly calculated that their food store would not be enough for so many people.\nIf the distribution was unequal, it would make the refugees even more emotional and cause internal strife amongst them. The situation would worsen.\nQiu Tong said indifferently, “We don’t have excess food.”\nShu Yuanwei had been hiding behind the refugees the entire time. When he heard Qiu Tong’s reply, he jumped out and said, “She’s lying!”\n“I saw with my own eyes that she bought several carts of food at the market. She must have hidden them somewhere!”\nKe Le spat on the ground and rushed to Shu Yuanwei. He grabbed Shu Yuanwei by the collar and punched him twice in the stomach. “Shut up if you don’t want to die!”\nThe refugees could tell that Ke Le and the others were very skilled. They picked up their wooden sticks and prepared to attack.\n“Qiu Tong? Are you alright?”\nIt was Song Yan, who had now barged into the villa with his men.",

They both knew that they needed to seize this opportunity. Taking advantage of the refugees’ moment of confusion, they gestured for their men to surround the refugees and separate them, before attacking them one by one.\nThe situation in the villa immediately turned chaotic. Tables, chairs and sofas were destroyed in the fight. Goose feathers and cotton-like items floated in the air, blocking the view.\nA knife-wielding refugee wanted to attack Qiu Tong from behind. Song Yan saw the dangerous situation from the corner of his eye. He propped himself onto the coffee table and leaped over. He kicked away the knife and grabbed Qiu Tong’s wrist, pulling her to a safe corner. He asked in a low voice, “Are you alright?”\nQiu Tong shook her head and tore off a long strip from the bottom of her T-shirt to wrap around her injured arm.\n“Shao An said that you won’t be here until two weeks later. Why are you here early?”\nSong Yan avoided her gaze and replied in a perfunctory tone, “I knew that there might be a riot in the city. I was worried about you and the children, so I came back to take a look. I didn’t really expect this…”\nQiu Tong raised her eyebrows in surprise. She looked at the side of Song Yan’s face and was about to say something to thank him when she saw a few refugees charging at them.\n“These refugees came from the neighboring city and have been forced into a corner. They are not afraid of death at all.”\n“You have to be careful! They have no qualms, so they are not afraid of being injured when they attack. They might even fight us to their death…”\nQiu Tong had lived in the post-apocalyptic era before. She knew better than anyone else the mentality of refugees, so she did not dare to be careless.\nThe mercenaries and Song Yan’s men were all elites, but the refugees outnumbered them. They were exhausted and seemed unable to hold on for much longer.\nThe leader of the refugees could see that they were lacking in stamina. He immediately shouted, “Defeat them and we won’t have to starve anymore!”\nThese words were like a stimulant. The refugees counterattacked with intense desire. Qiu Tong and Song Yan retreated to the bedroom door and gritted their teeth as they fought.\n…\nAt the airport in S City, Jin Yang’s helicopter landed. Mayor Shen came to welcome it personally.\nWhen his assistant received the news, he rushed to Mayor Shen’s side with a panicked expression, wanting to whisper to him and explain the situation.\nJin Yang tidied his clothes and looked up at him coldly. “Let me hear what you have to say.”\n“Mr. President, Mayor Shen, there’s a riot in the affluent villa district. The situation is unknown now, but it’s said that the entire district had a power outage and lost contact with the outside half an hour ago. It looks like the situation is not good…”\nJin Yang thought of Qiu Tong and immediately glared at Mayor Shen. “Didn’t you promise me over the phone that everything is under control?”\n“What’s going on?”\nJin Yang reprimanded in a raised voice. Mayor Shen was so frightened that he broke out in cold sweat. “Mr. President, the emotions of the refugees are uncontrollable!”\n“Dispatch a team of police officers over right now. I’ll personally lead them to the district as reinforcements.”\nJin Yang gave his commands. Mayor Shen opened his mouth to refute, but he noticed the ruthlessness in Jin Yang’s eyes and realized his order was indisputable. He hurriedly nodded and made the arrangements.\n10 minutes later, Jin Yang arrived at the villa compound with a large group of police officers. He rushed to the outside of Qiu Tong’s villa, but through the broken glass, he saw Qiu Tong and Song Yan together. He was just about to gesture at the police officers to charge in, but he suddenly froze and his hand hung in mid-air for a long time.\nWhy were they here together?!",

      "content": "Chapter 147: Splitting Up\nThere was an extremely strong telepathy between Jin Yang and Song Yan. Song Yan sensed his presence almost immediately and looked out the window.\n“Things have become interesting!”\nA teasing smile appeared on Song Yan’s face. From the corner of his eye, he saw Qiu Tong and the leader of the refugees locked in a stalemate. “Be careful!”\nQiu Tong had an extremely powerful healing ability, but she had no chance to use it now.\nThe refugees did not stop attacking. From time to time, Qiu Tong would glance over at the mercenaries protecting the children. With that distraction, she ended up getting some injuries.\nSong Yan looked at the leader of the refugees who was raising his machete high. He could have pushed Qiu Tong away, but when he thought of Jin Yang, he ran straight to Qiu Tong’s side and hugged her tightly, using his body to endure the attack on her behalf…\n“Are you all right?”\nQiu Tong supported Song Yan anxiously and looped his arm over her shoulder.\nKe Le heard her shout and rushed over to support her. “Boss, bring him to the window! I’ll help you stall for time!”\n“Hurry up and think of a way to escape. We can’t be trapped in this villa anymore. We are being forced into a corner here!”\nKe Le noticed this problem and growled hoarsely.\nQiu Tong nodded. “Hang in there! I’ll settle his injuries first and then give you guys the signal to break out.”\n“Let’s split up and meet up in the forest outside!”\nWith that, Qiu Tong helped Song Yan into a sitting position on the floor by the window. She looked at the knife wound on Song Yan’s back and narrowed her eyes, wanting to use her power to treat him. She leaned closer and carefully examined the extent of the wound. From Jin Yang’s perspective, it was an especially suggestive scene.\nSong Yan stared at Jin Yang provocatively. He raised his eyebrows and held Qiu Tong’s hand. He deliberately coughed weakly. “It’s alright.”\n“Don’t waste time on me. We have to leave this place as soon as possible.”\n“The situation in the villa district must have attracted the attention of the police. They will find a way to control the rioters.”\nSong Yan’s face was as pale as paper. He leaned his head gently on Qiu Tong’s shoulder, his hot breath landing on Qiu Tong’s neck. For some reason, Qiu Tong instinctively dodged. She supported Song Yan’s shoulders with both hands, but realized that his eyes were fixed on something outside the window.\n“What are you looking at?”\nQiu Tong followed his gaze and looked over. Jin Yang was nowhere to be seen on the other side of the hill. She frowned in confusion.\nSong Yan recalled Jin Yang’s conflicted expression and suppressed the smug smile on his face. He shook his head and propped himself up on the ground. He said, “We have to seize the moment and break out! They are a little tired now. This is the best opportunity!”\nQiu Tong found this a little strange, but she agreed with him. She sent Ke Le a signal and everyone forced their way out in different directions.\nThe mercenaries split up and carried the children away. They were pursued by the refugees in the bushes outside the villa. They hid Little Yu in the bushes and reminded her in a low voice, “Don’t make a sound. We will come back to get you after we chase away the bad guys!”\nLittle Yu covered her mouth with her hand, afraid of giving them even more trouble. She squatted in the bushes, tears welling up in her eyes.\nTime passed minute by minute. After a fierce battle with the refugees, the mercenaries were in a hurry to meet up with Ke Le and forgot about Little Yu, who was still in the bushes…\n“Uncles? Where are you?”\nLittle Yu stood up in fear and ran crying towards the forest.\nA lone refugee discovered her and wanted to attack and kidnap her as a hostage, but was knocked unconscious by Jin Yang.\n“Don’t be afraid!”\nJin Yang bent over and hugged Little Yu, coaxing her softly.",

      "content": "Chapter 148: Both Lost Their Memories\nThe police and mercenaries worked together to scatter the refugees. When Jin Yang returned to the villa with Little Yu in his arms, he found that it was already empty.\n“I’ll get you something to eat, okay?”\nJin Yang recalled some parenting books that he had previously read, and wanted to use food to placate Little Yu.\nHe was just about to place Little Yu on the sofa when the frightened little girl refused to let go. She felt an inexplicable closeness towards Jin Yang and hugged his neck tightly with her arms. Little Yu’s grape-like eyes revealed an uneasy look as she shook her head and said, “No!”\n“Little Yu is afraid of the bad guys! They might be hiding somewhere!”\nJin Yang looked at the adorable little girl and felt his heart melt from her childish voice. He could only hold her and sit down to coax her. “The bad guys have been chased away.”\nHis gaze landed awkwardly on the corner of the window where Qiu Tong and Song Yan had been. He frowned and fell into deep thought.\nLittle Yu bit her red lips and sized up Jin Yang seriously. “Uncle Song Yan, are you really our Daddy?”\n“Every time we encounter danger, you will appear to help us! Just like a hero in a fairy tale, a prince!”\nAfter interacting with him a few times, Little Yu’s impression of Jin Yang had changed. She even felt that it might be a good thing to have him protect her mother.\nJin Yang paused and shook his head after a moment of silence. “No.”\n“I just met your mommy not long ago. We didn’t know each other before. Don’t call me Daddy.”\nJin Yang raised his hand and tapped the tip of Little Yu’s nose. Seeing the loneliness in her eyes, his heart ached as if someone was tugging at it.\nIn the forest, Song Yan heard this conversation through the surveillance devices he had left in the villa. He leaned against a tree trunk with interest and frowned as he recalled the paternity test report that had been released from the hospital. “Strange, could it be that he doesn’t know?”\nSong Yan recalled Jin Yang’s abnormal actions. If he knew the identity of Qiu Xingyuan and the other children, he would definitely bring them back to the official residence to take care of them.\nIt really did not look like he was trying to avoid responsibility. Jin Yang really did not know!\n“This is getting more and more interesting!”\nIn the distance, Qiu Tong was comforting Qiu Xingyuan and the rest. Song Yan’s gaze landed on her and he muttered, “It looks like Jin Yang did have a past relationship with her, but somehow, both of them lost their memories of that period?”\n“Is this an opportunity bestowed upon me by the heavens?”\nSong Yan took a deep breath, his eyes sparkling with excitement.\nThe mercenaries returned to the forest in twos and threes to meet up with Ke Le. Qiu Tong checked everyone’s injuries but did not see Little Yu.\n“Did anyone see Little Yu?”\nQiu Xingqiao tugged at the corner of the mercenary’s shirt nervously as he asked with a trembling voice.\nThe mercenaries suddenly thought of Little Yu, who was hiding in the bushes. When they went back to look, she was nowhere to be seen!\n“Boss, we are sorry!”\nThey wanted to kneel down and apologize, but Qiu Tong held them up. “Don’t do that.”\nShe suppressed her anxiety and said, “You didn’t do anything wrong in the situation just now. Little Yu is very obedient. She definitely won’t run far. We have to find her as soon as possible before it gets dark…”\n“Yes!”\nThe mercenaries searched the surroundings. Song Yan looked in the direction of the villa and frowned as he called out to Qiu Tong.",

Only then will we be able to find traces of Little Yu in the shortest time possible.”\n“The mercenaries and my men have chased away the refugees. They probably won’t choose to bring a child along in their escape. Little Yu would just be a burden for them. Don’t worry! She should be fine…”\nSong Yan already knew that Little Yu was at the villa and he patted Qiu Tong’s shoulder comfortingly.\nQiu Tong nodded and instructed Ke Le to follow Song Yan’s instructions. Song Yan quietly walked to a dark corner and looked at Qiu Tong’s back profile as he dialed Jin Yang’s number. “Hello? The President is actually not in the official residence in the capital but in S City. If the news of this spreads, it will probably cause quite a stir, right?”\n“I didn’t expect the president to enjoy picking up girls using a fake name.”\nSong Yan’s voice was laced with provocation as he said softly, “What to do now? I’m already with Qiu Tong!”\n“I have to thank the president for creating an opportunity for us. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have met such a perfect and outstanding woman!”\nSong Yan could clearly sense that Jin Yang’s mood had worsened. The smile on his face widened.\nNo one knew Jin Yang’s character better than him. Jin Yang hated entanglements and having to fight others for something. He had been like this since he was young!\nAs long as Song Yan asked for it, Jin Yang would choose to give up any toy or opportunity to attend an important event. He disdained fighting and snatching.\nSong Yan took advantage of this character trait of his. He tilted his head and said deliberately, “Qiu Tong is a very clear-cut and frank person.”\n“She told me before that she hates it when people lie to her.”\n“If Qiu Tong finds out that the President is using someone else’s identity when interacting with her, what will she think? Will she think that the President suspects her and looks down on her background? That he treats her like a toy just to pass time?”\nJin Yang remained silent and did not answer. Song Yan’s voice suddenly turned cold as he suggested. “You better leave as soon as possible.”\n“Otherwise, it won’t do anyone any good if Qiu Tong finds out about this!”\nIn the villa, Jin Yang hung up the phone with a dark expression. He clenched his fists tightly, feeling deeply vexed.\nLittle Yu took out two bottles of milk from the fridge and tugged at Jin Yang’s sleeve. She wanted to share it with him, so she handed one over and said, “Uncle Song Yan, this is very delicious!”\n“Second Brother likes it the most. He doesn’t allow Brother Ye Luan to touch it!”\nJin Yang held the milk in his hand and rubbed the top of Little Yu’s head. He took a deep breath to calm himself before saying, “Can Little Yu stay at home obediently?”\n“Your mommy will be back soon. Uncle has something to do and has to leave.”\nLittle Yu blinked obediently and nodded vigorously. “I will take good care of myself!”\nIn the forest, Song Yan found an anxious Qiu Tong and said, “My men have already found Little Yu. She’s at the villa. Let’s go back.”\nWhen Qiu Tong heard this, she ran towards the villa. She suddenly pushed the door open and saw Little Yu drinking milk on the sofa. She hugged her tightly in joy. At this moment, the fear in her heart surged, causing Qiu Tong to collapse onto the sofa.\n“Thank you.”\nQiu Tong looked at Song Yan gratefully. When Little Yu saw him, she asked curiously, “Uncle, why are you here?”\nSong Yan guessed that Little Yu had mistaken him for Jin Yang. He walked over to Qiu Tong and gently pinched her face as he coaxed, “Uncle was worried about you, so he came back with Mommy to take a look.”",

      "content": "Chapter 150: Send To The Police Station\nThe rioting outside the villas had been quelled. The residents couldn’t help feeling relief as they came out of their basements.\nSong Yan’s subordinates tied Shu Yuanwei and the leader of the refugees up with hemp ropes and threw them onto the floor of the living room. They said, “Sir, we have already arrested all the refugees who participated in the riot and are waiting for your instructions. Also, how should we deal with this particular person?”\nShu Yuanwei thought that the riot would definitely succeed. He did not expect it to end up like this.\nShu Yuanwei knelt on the ground, thinking that he was really unlucky. Shu Xian and Lin Shan had both slipped away. He was the only one caught!\n“I didn’t do anything wrong. At most, I just gave them directions. What can you do to me?”\nShu Yuanwei raised his head stubbornly. His gaze landed on Song Yan, who was beside Qiu Tong. He immediately gaped in shock and panic.\n“Mr. President?”\nWhen Shu Yuanwei saw Song Yan’s face, he was so frightened that he knelt on the ground with a pale face and kowtowed repeatedly to beg for mercy. “I really didn’t know you and Qiu Tong had such a… such a relationship! I offended you, Sir. Please have mercy on a commoner like me. Let me off!”\nShu Yuanwei was so flustered that he kept stammering. He never expected that Qiu Tong’s backer would be the president himself.\n“I didn’t mean to go against Qiu Tong at the market. Why don’t we do this? In the future, the Qiu family can come to our food store to get grains and other foods whenever they want!”\n“I will give the order that no one will charge the Qiu family a single cent!”\nShu Yuanwei pleaded for mercy in an agitated manner, but Qiu Tong just stared coldly at his ingratiating and fearful face. She remained silent and sneered.\nSong Yan did not explain his identity. He just raised his hand and instructed his subordinate, “Send him to prison and charge him with the crime of burglary.”\n“As for your words of repentance, you can save them for your fellow prisoners in jail.”\nSong Yan waved his hand and his men dragged Shu Yuanwei out. Before he disappeared, he was still shouting, “Have mercy! I won’t dare to do it again!”\nQiu Tong asked Ke Le and the others to bring the children to the bedroom. She and Song Yan sat on the sofa and looked at the refugees kneeling on the ground.\n“Where are you from? Why are you robbing people in S City?”\nQiu Tong frowned and said, “Do you know that there’s a world of difference between begging and causing some ruckus on the streets compared to breaking into private homes and committing robbery? You might be sentenced to death…”\n“Who truly wishes to commit robbery? Who doesn’t want to live a proper life?”\nOne of the refugees looked up at Qiu Tong, still remembering the bags of grains she had given him. He replied with a wry smile, “We moved here from the neighboring city. Everyone originally had grain fields at home. Even if they couldn’t earn money, they could still keep their families warm and full. They wouldn’t go hungry.”\n“However, due to the locust plague, none of the grain fields produced any harvest!”\n“We heard that S City managed to control the locust plague. Although the harvest was halved, there is still food. Hence, our entire family moved here to beg for some food.” The refugees recalled the hardships they had faced along the way and covered their faces with their hands, unable to speak.\nQiu Tong asked doubtfully, “But if you want to beg for food, can’t you do it in your home city?”\n“There are also other wealthy districts in your city. Why did you come such a long way?”\nUpon hearing her question, another refugee explained, “There are already rioting hooligans running rampant on the streets of our city. They’ve already snatched away all the food. They attack and plunder food and money without any qualms. Some even target the women.”\n“We came here to take refuge!”",

      "content": "Chapter 151: Planning To Follow\nQiu Tong’s expression was slightly grave. She understood that the most important thing now was to eliminate the hooligans in that neighboring city.\nThe hooligans had forcefully occupied an important department of that city. They stockpiled weapons and gathered more hooligans to strengthen their forces.\nAs long as they existed, there would be an endless stream of refugees spreading to the surrounding cities. This riot would never stop!\nQiu Tong surveyed the villa with furrowed brows. She saw the damaged wardrobe, furniture, and frightened children. “We have to get rid of the hooligans.”\nSong Yan nodded in agreement. “I’ll bring some people to the neighboring city to check on the situation.”\n“I’ll go with you!”\nSong Yan wanted to reject Qiu Tong’s suggestion, but she said with a serious expression, “I don’t want the children to live in constant danger. If hooligans occupy a city by force, it will cause refugees and riots. I need everything to return to how it was before.”\n“This concerns my own interests. Even if you don’t bring me along, I will go there myself.”\nQiu Tong expressed her determination. Song Yan could tell that she was stubborn and persistent, so he could only nod in agreement. “We’ll work together then.”\n“Good.”\nQiu Tong looked at the children and frowned worriedly.\nKe Le and the mercenaries moved the overturned sofa and wardrobe back to their original positions. Qiu Tong called them over and instructed in a low voice, “We are going to the neighboring city to deal with the hooligans. I’ll leave the children to you. You must protect them!”\n“Understood, Boss. Don’t worry.”\nKe Le replied in a hoarse voice. Their conversation attracted Qiu Xingyuan’s attention. He quietly walked to Ke Le’s side and asked about Qiu Tong’s arrangements.\n“Boss asked me to take good care of you guys. She will be leaving with that man for a period of time…”\nKe Le answered honestly. Qiu Xingyuan, Qiu Xingyuan, Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu’s expressions stiffened.\nThey all turned to look at Song Yan and Qiu Tong. They fixed their eyes on Qiu Tong, who would nod from time to time. The children could sense the admiration in her eyes. “Mommy won’t abandon us, will she?”\nLittle Yu asked in a low and innocent voice. The three children were still filled with worry and fear.\nThey were afraid that Qiu Tong would abandon them and run away with Song Yan!\nIn the middle of the night, Qiu Tong was sleeping in her bedroom. Qiu Xingyuan gently pushed open his own bedroom door and knocked on Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu’s rooms to call them out.\nIn the darkness of the night, the three children rubbed their sleepy eyes as they analyzed the situation.\n“Whether Mommy wants to subdue the hooligans or create an opportunity to be alone with that man, we can’t let her go alone!”\nQiu Xingyuan frowned seriously. Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu nodded eagerly. They echoed, “Yes, yes! We want to follow Mommy.”\n“We all have the ability to protect Mommy!”\n“If Mommy refuses to bring us along, we’ll sneak out…”\nQiu Xingyuan carried his piggy bank and listened to the sounds inside. He seemed to have some savings. With a serious expression, he said, “I’ll smash open this piggy bank. It should be enough for us to buy a ticket to the neighboring city.”\n“Okay!”\nThe three children confirmed their plan and clenched their fists together, quietly cheering each other on!",

      "content": "Chapter 152: Failed Plan\nThe next morning, Qiu Tong packed her things and prepared to leave, but she could feel several pairs of eyes burning into her.\nShe casually turned to look and saw Little Yu huddled on the sofa, holding a children’s book to shield her eyes. She looked a little guilty.\nQiu Tong found it strange, but she continued packing and turned to Song Yan to confirm the necessary weapons and communication devices.\nQiu Xingyu and Qiu Xingqiao exchanged glances. She bit her lips and jumped off the sofa, pretending that her legs had gone limp and she had fallen.\n“Aiya…”\nQiu Tong hurried over to Little Yu’s side and lifted her trouser leg to check if her ankle was seriously injured. She cautioned her. “Be more careful in the future. Otherwise, you might get injured and get a scar! That won’t be pretty anymore!”\nLittle Yu blinked and pretended to reach for a glass cup on the coffee table, but her hand slipped and she shattered the cup.\nGlass fragments scattered all over the ground. Qiu Tong frowned and picked up Little Yu, moving her to a safe place.\n“Mommy, aren’t I stupid? I can’t do anything without you!”\nLittle Yu hugged Qiu Tong’s neck tightly and pleaded coquettishly, “Mommy, don’t leave me, okay?”\nQiu Tong didn’t understand her hint and thought that she couldn’t bear to part with her. She helplessly carried her to the bathroom. “Little Yu, be good.”\n“Mommy will be back after settling the riot in the neighboring city. Be good and stay at home. Don’t run around.”\nQiu Tong wiped the corners of Little Yu’s eyes with a wet towel. She then helped her to brush her teeth and wash her face.\nThe two of them came out of the washroom. Little Yu gave Qiu Xingyuan a meaningful look and pouted. She mouthed, “Plan A failed!”\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao looked at each other in dismay. They did not expect Qiu Tong to not even mention bringing them along.\nQiu Xingqiao gently nudged Qiu Xingyuan with his shoulder to let him carry out the second plan.\nQiu Xingyuan did not know how to act coquettishly or show weakness. He frowned and walked awkwardly towards Qiu Tong. He raised his small, cold face and asked, “That bad woman Lin Shan already knows where we live. And they know that if the power source is cut, the electric fence around the villa will be completely ineffective.”\n“If you leave, she might come looking to make trouble for us!”\n“If she and the other bad guys work together to take revenge, we will be in danger.”\nQiu Tong looked at his evasive gaze and mistook Qiu Xingyuan for being worried about the villa’s security measures. She pointed at Ke Le and the mercenaries who were repairing the doors and windows and said, “Uncle Ke Le will protect you. Everything will be fine.”\nQiu Xingyuan widened his eyes in surprise. He opened his mouth several times but did not say anything. He just pursed his thin lips and stood stubbornly in front of Qiu Tong.\nYe Luan came out of the bedroom with a glass of water in his hand and quietly watched the children’s actions.\nHe leaned against the shoe cabinet near the entrance and suddenly chuckled. “Auntie Qiu, don’t you realize that they are just pretending to be helpless, so that you will worry and can bring them along to the neighboring city?”\n“Or should I say… it’s a sign of insecurity when children can’t bear to be separated from their mother.”\nYe Luan had exposed the children’s plan. Qiu Xingqiao clenched his fists and glared at him. He said angrily, “You don’t have to be such a busybody. You’re always so nosy!”\n“Is that true?”\nQiu Tong looked at Qiu Xingyuan’s slightly flushed face with bewilderment.",

      "content": "Chapter 153: Family Moving Together\nQiu Xingyuan took two steps back and looked away. He pursed his lips tightly and refused to answer.\nQiu Tong asked in amusement, “So when Qiu Xingqiao woke up and couldn’t find his clothes, and Little Yu accidentally shattered a glass cup… was this part of your plan?”\nThe three children kept silent, feeling uneasy. They glared at Ye Luan bitterly, blaming him for spoiling their plans.\n“I didn’t expect you to have such a cute side!”\n“This coquettish side to you is really… a little special! Why don’t Mommy give you another chance to carry out your act again?”\nQiu Tong teased. Qiu Xingyuan put on a straight face and wanted to return to the bedroom.\nQiu Tong pulled him back into her arms. Qiu Xingyuan was in her warm embrace and tried to pry her arms away, feeling a little uncomfortable.\n“Actually, you don’t have to come up with such a complicated plan. You can just tell Mommy what you want.”\n“We’re a family. There’s no need to be so paranoid about many things. This will easily cause misunderstandings between us and might even affect our communication, understand?”\nQiu Tong rubbed the top of Qiu Xingyuan’s head, messing up his neat hair.\nShe looked at the children with a gentle but serious gaze. “Mommy is going to do very dangerous things in the neighboring city. Do you really want to follow me?”\nQiu Xingyuan patted down his messy hair and gave an inaudible grunt.\n“Then, you have to promise Mommy that you can’t run around and must be obedient! Do you understand?”\nQiu Xingqiao nodded vigorously and took the lead in expressing his stance. “We can help. We will definitely not bring you trouble!”\nAs a result, Qiu Tong had no choice but to ask Ke Le to help the children pack some simple luggage.\nSensing Qiu Tong’s compromise, Little Yu jumped up excitedly and waved her arms. She ran to Qiu Tong’s side and said, “Mommy agrees?”\nQiu Tong nodded. Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao were also very happy but they looked like they were suppressing their emotions. She found it rather funny.\n“Mommy is the best!”\nLittle Yu expressed her emotions openly. Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao looked at her affectionate manner and felt a little envious.\nHalf an hour later, Song Yan waited outside with his team. He saw Qiu Tong bringing the children along. Song Yan took the initiative to take their luggage and placed them in the trunk. “It won’t be too long a car journey. Will the children be carsick?”\nQiu Tong shook her head. Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao stared at Song Yan with eyes filled with hostility. They shut their mouths and did not answer.\n“Uncle Song Yan, I want a hug!”\nLittle Yu had gone missing yesterday and Jin Yang had saved her. Naturally, she had some feelings for “Song Yan”.\nSong Yan was stunned. He looked at the girl rushing over from Qiu Tong’s arms and instinctively opened his arms to hug her. His body was a little stiff.\nHe actually didn’t like children, but because of Qiu Tong’s gaze, he could only force an awkward smile and look down at Little Yu.\n“Thank you Uncle, for yesterday!”\nLittle Yu took the initiative to show how close she was to Song Yan. She kissed Song Yan’s face several times.\nSong Yan felt the little girl’s saliva all over his face. His scalp went numb and he hurriedly tried to push Little Yu further away. He took two deep breaths and persuaded patiently, “You’re a girl. You must be more careful and not behave too intimately with boys.”\n“You can’t let strange boys hug you or kiss you, much less take advantage…”\nLittle Yu looked at him in confusion. After a moment of hesitation, she tilted her head and said, “But Uncle Song Yan is not a stranger.”\nSong Yan was completely defeated by the naive child. He gave up and hugged Little Yu. “That’s right. As long as Little Yu is happy!”",

He also learned that there was a gang of hooligans in the neighboring city.\nHe deployed his skilled personal guards to the neighboring city to suppress and clean up the hooligans.\nJin Yang threw the statements on the table and was about to leave the detention center when he suddenly heard a commotion outside. The police officers in the detention center hurriedly ran out with their batons and guns.\nThe police captain kept urging, \"Hurry up, don't let them escape!\"\nJin Yang frowned and gestured for the guards beside him to stop a few police officers for questioning.\n\"What happened?\"\nWhen the police officer saw Jin Yang, he was so frightened that he immediately stood firmly in his military stance. He raised his hand and saluted as he replied, \"Mr. President, there were too many refugees arrested just now and not enough guards in the prison. I don't know how the prisoners knew of this but they actually instigated a riot in an attempt to escape!\"\n\"A few prisoners have already started climbing over the barbed wire fence. We were ordered by the warden to go as reinforcements!\"\nJin Yang did not expect that the refugee problem would result in so much additional trouble. They exposed the negligence of the prison management!\nHe wanted to arrange for his guards to help deal with it, but he suddenly recalled the report about Qiu Tong. Her father Qiu Rong seemed to be imprisoned in S City!\nJin Yang frowned worriedly. \"Let's go take a look.\"\nHis guards were worried about his safety and wanted to stop him, but he realized that Jin Yang's expression was serious. \"Yes, Mr. President.\"\nOutside the prison, many prisoners had already climbed out of the outer wall. The police officers were engaged in a melee with them.\nJin Yang waved his hand, indicating for the guards to step in and help. He pushed open the prison door and asked for Qiu Rong's prison number. He then strode over to check on the situation.\n\"Cough coughâ€¦cough cough!\"\nA weak cry for help came from the end of the gloomy and dark corridor. Qiu Rong was being strangled by one of his cellmates. His face had turned purple and his pupils were dilated. \"Help, help!\"\nWhen Jin Yang saw the two entangled figures, he suddenly lifted his leg and kicked open the metal door, knocking over the criminal who had tried to kill Qiu Rong.\nQiu Rong lay on the ground panting heavily. The police officers who had rushed over immediately arrested the perpetrator and brought him out of the prison cell.\nJin Yang saw that Qiu Rong's expression had eased a little. He reached out to help him up and asked in a low voice, \"Are you alright?\"\nQiu Rong held his hand and stood up with difficulty. He originally wanted to thank his benefactor for saving his life, but when he saw that it was Jin Yang, his expression became slightly conflicted. He swallowed the words of gratitude he was about to say.\n\"Howâ€¦how's my daughter?\"\nRead latest Chapters at W u xiaWorld.Site Only\nQiu Rong asked in a hoarse voice. Jin Yang didn't notice the change in his attitude and arranged for the warden to transfer him to a relatively safe cell.\nThe warden acutely sensed Jin Yang's care for Qiu Rong and naturally did not dare to object.\nJin Yang looked at Qiu Rong's aged face and replied indifferently, \"Qiu Tong is very safe. So are the children.\"\n\"I won't tell them what happened to you in prison. Don't worry.\"\nQiu Rong looked at Jin Yang gratefully and heaved a sigh of relief. He smiled weakly and nodded. \"That's good.. It's good that they're alright!\"\n•••",

He hurriedly accepted the order and said, “Sir, don’t worry. I will definitely reorganize the various departments in the prison. Today’s incident will never happen again…”\nJin Yang nodded and left with a cold and indifferent gaze. Mayor Shen watched as his figure disappeared from the prison and hurriedly urged his subordinates to tabulate the prison name list.\nIt would take some time to sort out the information on the hundreds of prisoners. Mayor Shen sat in the warden’s office and waited for the news. Soon, a police officer ran in with a list of names. “Mayor, these are the names of the prisoners who escaped.”\n“There were about a dozen, but their offences were relatively minor. They won’t be too dangerous to society.”\nMayor Shen flipped through the list. When he heard the police officer’s report, he immediately regarded him with a serious expression, “So what if they are not murderers? We don’t need to re-capture them then? These people escaped from prison! Wake up your idea!”\n“Even if they only had one more day to serve before their release, you have to arrest them and make them serve out their last day!”\nMayor Shen issued his orders and the police officers quickly complied and went to search for them.\nMayor Shen casually spread out the stack of information on the escaped prisoners on the office table. Yu Ge’s picture and information were in that stack.\n…\nIn the neighboring city, Qiu Tong and Song Yan rushed to their destination and found their surroundings desolate.\nIn the middle of the street were overturned baskets of rice and flour, as well as torn clothes and fabric. There were a few bloodstains in front of the trash can at the corner of the street. It was obvious that this place had been attacked and plundered by hooligans. The glass windows of the surrounding residential buildings and shops were already shattered, and none of the households were lit. Their doors and windows were tightly shut.\nQiu Tong and the others’ footsteps were extremely light, but they sounded especially crisp and clear in this deathly silent environment.\nThe children felt rather stifled. They held each other’s hands and followed closely behind Qiu Tong, not daring to make a sound.\n“Hello, is anyone here?”\n“We came from S City to help you…”\nSong Yan’s subordinates knocked on the doors of several residents, but there was no response.\nSuddenly, a figure popped out of the window of a dilapidated building. The thin, sallow-faced man stared warily at Qiu Tong and the others. He waved his hand and urged them, “Leave quickly. They’ve already plundered our place. As long as you hide, you won’t be beaten and robbed again!”\n“Don’t anger them. When they come back…”\n“I don’t want to die! I don’t want to die by their guns! Please stop meddling in other people’s business!”\nThe man seemed to have thought of something terrifying. He slammed the door shut in fear and used a wooden block to block his door.\nQiu Tong frowned and wanted to go forward to ask where the hooligans were gathered, but she could not get an answer no matter how hard she tried.\nShe shook her head at Song Yan and sighed. “Looks like they are too scared of the hooligans. They only want to hide and don’t dare to resist. We have to rely on ourselves to find their gathering place…”\nBang! Bang! Bang!\nJust as Song Yan was about to reply, several gunshots rang out. Qiu Tong and Song Yan looked at each other before rushing in the direction of the noise.",

Qiu Tong and Song Yan hid behind the broken walls of the building to investigate the situation.\nIn the dark night, Qiu Tong and Song Yan laid low for nearly ten minutes without hearing any more gunshots. They exchanged glances and silently retreated to a quieter corner. Song Yan lowered his voice and said, \"From the looks of it, the gunshots might have been misfirings while they were adjusting their guns.\"\n\"According to what the resident said earlier, they have already searched the residential buildings and shops in this area. It's relatively safer.\"\n\"Arrange for a large team to camp here. Stay alert and wait for orders.\"\nSong Yan put on his pistol and protective gear and continued, \"I'll go and check on the situation when it gets later into the night.\"\n\"I will go and get a general idea of their situation. We will discuss the specific battle plan when I return.\"\nSong Yan wanted to stand up and leave, but Qiu Tong held onto his arm and insisted with a determined look, \"I'll go with you.\"\n\"If you go alone and encounter danger, it will be very hard for you to escape. The two of us can take care of each other. If we encounter danger, we can discuss countermeasures. Now is not the time to be stubborn. Safety first!\"\nSong Yan looked at her in surprise and felt relieved. He could sense that Qiu Tong was concerned about him. However, Song Yan was not sure if her concern was for him oratain Yang? \"The situation is unstable now. There is danger everywhere. The children need your presence and for you to take care of them. I can get a few subordinates to accompany me.\" Song Yan objected to Qiu Tong's suggestion, but she frowned impatiently. \"Stop nagging.\" \"Ke Le and the rest can protect the children. Qiu Xingyuan and Ye Luan will also take care of their younger siblings.\" \"Your subordinates are good at close combat, but their investigative abilities are inferior to mine!\" \"You should know that I'm the best choice!\" Time was ticking away. Song Yan finally relented and agreed to Qiu Tong's plan. The two of them hurried over to the vicinity of the tube-shaped apartment to investigate.\nQiu Tong gestured to Song Yan and ran around the corner to the back of the tube-shaped building. She realized that the seemingly dilapidated building was filled with noisy music and the sounds of drinking and chatting. Song Yan followed and pointed at a few tents set up in the empty space in front of the building. \"There are about a dozen guns, some grenades and gunpowder.\"\n\"But the gunpowder is homemade, so it can't cause much damage.\"\nQiu Tong pointed upstairs and exchanged information with Song Yan in a low voice. \"There are about a hundred people. They are disorderly and lax in management.\"\nIt seemed that this gang of hooligans had expanded in a hurry, and there were all sorts of riff-raff mixed in. Only 6o% to 70% of them actually had combat skills.\n\"Let's go back first.\" Song Yan and Qiu Tong looked at each other, wanting to quietly retreat the way they came. \"Who's there! Don't move!\"\nOutside the apartment building, a gangster holding a gun was hiccuping as he staggered closer. He swung the submachine gun on his shoulder when he saw the two shadows in the darkness. He asked, \"Who are you? Why are you here?\"\nSong Yan and Qiu Tong frowned, knowing that it was not good to make too much noise now.\nIf they were to attract the other hooligans around the building, they would be in an extremely unfavorable situation!\nQiu Tong's eyes darted around. She suddenly thought of a way. She grabbed Song Yan's arm and hurriedly said, \"Let me borrow you for a moment!\"\nBefore Song Yan could react, he saw Qiu Tong grabbing his hand and placing it on her waist...",

      "content": "Chapter 157: Gangster\nThe gangster stared at the two entangled figures and swallowed quietly. He took two steps forward and shouted, “Don’t move!”\nQiu Tong pretended to be an amorous couple with Song Yan. When she saw the gangster approaching, she pretended to be afraid and hid in Song Yan’s arms.\n“It’s all your fault. It’s been so dangerous outside recently, and you still asked me to come here!”\n“It’s the wilderness. What should we do now?”\nQiu Tong signaled Song Yan with her eyes to cooperate with her.\nAt this moment, Song Yan finally understood what Qiu Tong meant by borrowing him. He had no choice but to put on an act and hug her slender waist, pretending to be a man whose mind had been bewitched by lust. Song Yan said awkwardly, “I… I’m going to do you right here!”\nThe gangster was a little tipsy. Under the moonlight, he saw Qiu Tong’s charming figure and had some wicked thoughts.\nQiu Tong took the opportunity to beg, “Big Brother, please don’t tell anyone about us. Otherwise, I won’t be able to face anyone!”\n“We’ll leave now. We won’t disturb you.”\nQiu Tong grabbed Song Yan’s hand and the two of them were about to leave when they heard the gangster shout, “Who told you to leave?”\n“Move again and I’ll shoot!”\nThe gangster held his belt and wiped his nose with the back of his hand. He stared at Qiu Tong and said, “I won’t call anyone else over, but you have to come and give me a good time!”\n“I haven’t had sweet flesh for many days. The women in the city are thick-waisted shrews. They don’t taste as good as you.”\n“I saw you guys coming here in the middle of the night to hook up. You must be very open-minded then.”\nWielding his gun, the gangster said with a wicked smile, “As long as you make me happy, I’ll let you go!”\nSong Yan looked a little unhappy. He reached for the gun at his waist, wanting to fight with the gangster.\nQiu Tong could tell what he wanted to do. She pressed his hand and shook her head, indicating for him to calm down.\nThey were very close to the building. If they opened fire, the entire gang would be mobilized. Qiu Tong and Song Yan would definitely not be a match for the whole party.\nNow, she could only pretend to agree and lower her guard.\nSong Yan understood Qiu Tong’s intentions. He gritted his teeth and said loudly, “Come over then, but be gentle. Don’t hurt my girlfriend.”\nThe gangster saw that Qiu Tong was not resisting at all. He lustfully approached the two of them and gestured for Song Yan to stand further away.\n“Big Brother, it’s so inconvenient for you to carry that gun around.”\n“What if you misfire and get injured? Don’t you already have a nice big gun in your pants?”\nStanding in a sultry manner under the moonlight, Qiu Tong deliberately used a cheap seducing trick. The gangster lost control and threw his gun onto the ground, before unbuttoning his pants.\n“Die!”\nQiu Tong seized the opportunity and swiftly approached him, using her hands to twist his neck. With a cracking sound, the guard fell to the ground, unconscious.\nSong Yan watched her movements and couldn’t help clapping in surprise.\n“I didn’t expect you to be such a violent woman.”\n“When he wakes up, he’ll probably be afraid of women for the rest of his life, right?”\nSong Yan dragged the gangster over to a nearby drain and threw him in. He picked up the gun and prepared to bring it back to the camp.\nQiu Tong glanced at him and said sarcastically, “Your acting skills are really lousy.”",

      "content": "Chapter 158: Surrounded\nIn the wee hours of the morning, Qiu Tong and Song Yan deployed their forces to surround the tube-shaped building according to the terrain map drawn up.\nThe violent sounds of gunfire continued for nearly half an hour. Qiu Tong and Song Yan estimated that the firepower of the hooligan gang would definitely be insufficient to resist. Just as they were about to bring the rest of the troops down to assist in the attack, one of the soldiers from the front hurried back and reported, “Sir, they ran into the mountains through the tunnels!”\nQiu Tong and Song Yan frowned. They did not expect there to be a secret underground passage!\nNow that the hooligans were frightened and had fled in a panic, they definitely would not have enough weapons with them. This was the best opportunity to pursue and attack.\n“We will lead a team and surround them from both sides of the mountain!”\n“If we give them time to rest and adjust to the new situation, things will definitely be disadvantageous for us…”\nSong Yan agreed with Qiu Tong’s suggestion and immediately assigned the men and weaponry.\nQiu Xingyu was a little afraid as she recalled the fierce battle at the villa with the refugees. She hugged Song Yan nervously. “Uncle, I’m afraid.”\n“Can I come with you? You will definitely be able to protect Little Yu. Just like that day… I only trust you!”\nSong Yan looked down at her with a serious expression. There was impatience in his heart, but he could not show it.\nQiu Tong would be leading a small group of elite soldiers to quickly search the mountain. It would not be suitable to bring the children along. As a result, Song Yan could only reluctantly nod in agreement.\n“I want to protect my little sister. I am coming along too.”\nQiu Xingyuan said with great determination. Qiu Xingqiao nodded vigorously and added, “Wherever Little Yu is, we will be there.”\nSong Yan looked at the increasing number of burdens. His gaze landed on Ye Luan.\nYe Luan took out a dagger and stood firmly beside Qiu Tong. He raised his stubborn little face and said, “I’ll follow Auntie Qiu.”\nQiu Tong saw that Song Yan had many men by his side. Even so, she felt worried. She instructed the three children, “You must follow Uncle Song Yan closely and not run around. The battlefield is very dangerous. If you encounter bad people, you have to shout loudly, understand?”\nQiu Xingyuan pursed his thin lips. He could sense Qiu Tong’s anxiety and worry. He nodded. “I will protect them.”\nQiu Tong forced a smile and stared at Song Yan. “Protect them!”\nSong Yan nodded in agreement. After affirming the headcounts of the two teams, they headed into the mountains from different directions.\nThe path into the mountain was a little rugged. Qiu Tong held Ye Luan’s little hand and reminded him to pay attention to rocky terrain. Ye Luan followed them with difficulty, unwilling to fall behind. He said, “Auntie Qiu, you don’t have to worry about me. I won’t be a burden.”\nQiu Tong looked up worriedly at the spot where Song Yan’s team had disappeared. Suddenly, she heard a few gunshots.\nEveryone instantly went on high alert and hid behind a bunker. Qiu Tong aimed her gun at the enemy in front and pulled the trigger.\nGunshots rang out repeatedly in the forest, seemingly coming from different places.\nJin Yang rushed over from S City with his subordinates. Seeing that the building was empty, he knew that someone must have launched a surprise attack.\n“Bring your men to the mountains to provide support.”\n“Remember to differentiate between our side and the enemy! Don’t harm our own people…”\nFor some reason, the image of Qiu Tong suddenly appeared in Jin Yang’s mind. He frowned worriedly and rushed into the mountains.",

      "content": "Chapter 159: No Reinforcements\nThe hooligans did not expect to meet such a tough opponent. They could tell that Song Yan and his men were armed and that they were no match for them.\nThey had originally planned to retreat into the mountains and take advantage of the terrain to take a breather. They would wait for their injured men to recover before going down the mountain to counterattack.\nBut the hooligans did not expect Qiu Tong, Song Yan and their team to pursue them.\nThey had no choice but to try and hold back the enemy with artillery fire. Song Yan and his men were targeting the main escape route of the hooligans. Their firepower was concentrated and fierce. Song Yan arranged for one of his men to keep an eye on the three children. He then immediately issued an order to find cover, stall and attract the enemy’s firepower.\nSong Yan’s man hid the children under a safe rock bunker. He watched the intense battle, not wishing to be a babysitter.\n“Hide here and don’t run around!”\nWith that, he stood up and rushed to the front line. Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao shielded Little Yu at the innermost part of the rock and stared warily at the surrounding movements.\nQiu Xingqiao noticed the few grenades on the ground. Hunching, he slipped over to pick them up.\n“Elder Brother, we have to help too.”\nQiu Xingyuan nodded with a tense expression.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao had a comprehensive understanding of military equipment so they knew how to use grenades. They used their short stature to evade the enemy’s notice and approached the hooligans’ hiding place. They threw the grenades…\nBoom—\nThe grenades detonated one after another. The hooligans suffered heavy losses and the gunshots gradually died down.\nJust as the children were rejoicing, they suddenly heard one of Song Yan’s subordinates running over. “Sir, the enemy in front of us has already retreated.”\n“Some of the enemies are fleeing in the direction of Qiu Tong. Her team doesn’t have that many men and we don’t know if they have enough guns and ammunition. Should we send a portion of our men over to support them?”\n“It seems that the enemy wants to retreat to the vicinity of the mountaintop and use the height as an advantage before counterattacking.”\nAnother one of the subordinates objected. “We can’t stay here for too long. We have to chase after them and scatter them…”\nSong Yan frowned as he thought about it. He knew Qiu Tong’s ability to analyze the situation. He determined that the hooligans were already in a panic and were unable to think straight now. If he sent his men over to reinforce Qiu Tong’s team now, it would very likely cause trouble for her instead.\nQiu Tong’s team had a few local soldiers who were familiar with the terrain of the mountains. They should be able to handle them.\n“No need. Continue to search according to the original plan. Don’t leave a single enemy alive!”\nSong Yan paused for a few seconds before giving the order.\nQiu Xingyuan, Qiu Xingqiao, and Little Yu were hiding behind a rock. When they heard Song Yan’s conversation with his subordinates, they immediately became nervous and worried.\n“Will Mommy be in danger?”\nLittle Yu asked with teary eyes. Qiu Xingyuan also felt like his heart was being squeezed by two hands.\nQiu Xingqiao looked at the surrounding guards in silence. He suddenly said, “We have to help her.”\nLittle Yu also hurriedly nodded and said, “That’s right, Elder Brother. Let’s go help Mommy! Little Yu can throw bombs. I am very accurate!”\nQiu Xingyuan and Little Yu stared at Qiu Xingyuan nervously, waiting for him to make a decision.\nQiu Xingyuan nodded. “Alright.”\nThe three children quietly crouched down to avoid Song Yan’s subordinate’s line of sight. They ran in the direction of Qiu Tong along the small path behind the mountain.",

      "content": "Chapter 160: Coincidental Encounter\nOn the other side of the mountain, Qiu Tong was engaged in a tug-of-war with the remaining hooligans. The three children followed the gunshots and hid in a pile of rocks and grass to watch.\nSong Yan’s subordinates were highly experienced and worked well together. Compared to the reckless hooligans, Qiu Tong had the advantage.\n“Should we go around the mountain from the back?”\nSong Yan’s men suggested according to the terrain. Qiu Tong narrowed her eyes and realized that the hooligans seemed to be deliberately luring them deeper into the forest.\nShe imagined that there would definitely be a gathering place in the mountains. Qiu Tong instructed her team. “Find a place to surround the area 100 meters ahead. We also have to reduce the frequency of our attacks. Order a few scouts to throw away their guns and empty magazines…”\n“Are you trying to confuse them?”\nSong Yan’s subordinates could tell that Qiu Tong knew how to deploy troops. Their expressions changed from suspicion to trust as they obeyed her orders.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao realized that there were a few hooligans who wanted to ambush Qiu Tong. They immediately tried to warn her nervously.\nQiu Xingqiao picked up the slingshot that he carried with him and picked up a few stones from the ground. He aimed at the hooligan’s eyeballs.\nThe hooligan’s eyes were attacked and he instinctively wailed, “Ouch…”\nTheir hiding spots were exposed. Qiu Tong and her subordinates captured them alive for interrogation after.\nSeeing that the situation had stabilized, Little Yu wanted to run out to look for Qiu Tong, but Qiu Xingyuan hurriedly grabbed her wrist and shook his head. “No.”\n“She asked us to follow Song Yan. If she knows that we came here on our own, she will definitely scold us!”\nLittle Yu pouted reluctantly and pointed at Qiu Xingqiao’s slingshot. “But we helped Mommy beat up the bad guys. Second Brother and Eldest Brother are very powerful. We helped Mommy beat back several bad guys! Why wouldn’t she praise us?”\nQiu Xingyuan coaxed Little Yu in exasperation. He and Qiu Xingqiao looked at each other. The three children planned to sneak back the way they came from.\nHalfway up the mountain, Jin Yang heard the sounds of gunshot and rushed over to help. He appeared at the fork in the road with a group of people.\nThe gunshots had suddenly stopped and they could not determine the exact location of the enemy. They could only wait…\nLittle Yu saw Jin Yang from afar. She shook off Qiu Xingqiao’s hand and skipped over to throw herself into Jin Yang’s arms.\nJin Yang was shocked by the sudden appearance of the three children, but he instinctively bent down to carry Little Yu.\nThe president’s guard instinctively wanted to stop the children from approaching. Jin Yang furrowed his brows and signaled them to move aside.\nLittle Yu didn’t notice anything amiss and hugged Jin Yang’s neck affectionately. She smiled sweetly and said, “Uncle Song Yan is looking for us? We’re very safe. We definitely won’t cause trouble for you and Mommy!”\nJin Yang’s expression and body stiffened when he heard Song Yan’s name.\nWhen Little Yu saw his stiff expression, her eyes darted around. She held Jin Yang and kissed him twice.\nJin Yang’s face was covered in the little girl’s saliva. The president’s guards had never seen him like this before. They all lowered their heads, not daring to look straight at him.\nLittle Yu obediently continued, “Uncle Song Yan, don’t be angry!”\nWhen Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao saw Little Yu behaving so intimately with him, their faces fell in annoyance. At the same time, an idea popped up in their minds—\nTheir little sister had changed sides!!",

      "content": "Chapter 161: Escorting The Children\nJin Yang was a solitary character. Even Shao An, who had followed him for many years, was unable to get too close to him. He still had to maintain a safe distance from him.\nBut now, Jin Yang was letting Little Yu behave wantonly in his arms. He even wiped her saliva on his collar.\nThe president’s guards were shocked and stole glances at his face, which was very similar to those of the three children. They lowered their heads and speculated about their relationship.\nJin Yang brought the children to a safe hiding spot and asked tentatively, “Why are you guys here?”\nLittle Yu was innocent and naive. She was not guarded at all. She explained all their plans. “We overheard that you didn’t want to help Mommy. We were afraid that she would be in danger, so we secretly came to help Mommy beat up the bad guys!”\n“Second Brother is very powerful. His slingshot is very accurate.”\n“Eldest Brother is very smart. He was the one who led Second Brother and Little Yu to find Mommy’s location! We’re very powerful, right?”\nHearing Little Yu’s explanation, Jin Yang’s expression was somewhat complex and unfathomable.\nAlthough the children were brave and resourceful, the situation in the mountains was constantly changing and filled with danger. It was definitely not safe for them to rush out now.\nSong Yan did not even realize they were missing!\nJin Yang hugged Little Yu tightly in fear. He looked at the two boys who were extremely hostile towards him. “I’ll bring you guys to help Mommy, okay?”\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao stared at him doubtfully and asked, “Really?”\n“Of course, the situation on the battlefield has changed because of your help. I have to help her lure the enemy into an ambush.”\nJin Yang gently calmed the children’s emotions by acknowledging their help. At the same time, he called the guards beside him and said in a low voice, “Qiu Tong should have a plan. You guys will coordinate from the front and force the scattered hooligans to the ambush she has set up.”\nJin Yang reminded softly. “Remember, don’t let her team discover you…”\nThe guards respectfully obeyed the order but could not help muttering in their hearts. When had the president ever cared so much about the feelings of others?\nIt seemed that this Ms. Qiu Tong held an extraordinary place in the president’s heart!\nThe mountains were cold at night as a chilly wind blew. Little Yu could not help sneezing. Jin Yang looked down at her, Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao, who were all wearing thin clothes. He frowned and looked for a place to hide nearby. “Let’s go and rest for a while. We’ll wait for Mommy to return.”\nJin Yang found a nearby house and brought the three children in to take shelter from the wind.\nSeeing Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao sitting beside Little Yu and protecting her, Jin Yang smiled. He walked to the door to give the children some privacy. He recalled Song Yan’s warning to him. “Qiu Tong hates it when others lie to her…”\nJin Yang’s smile gradually disappeared. He clenched his fists and hammered on the door frame, his breathing heavy and vexed.\n“Sir, all the hooligans have already entered Qiu Tong’s ambush. They have cleared the obstacles outside and can retreat at any time.”\n“Should we send the children to her?”\nThe president’s guard ran over and reported. Jin Yang listened to the sounds of gunshots coming from the mountains and knew that the situation outside was not stable. He shook his head and said, “Go find some food and let the children fill their stomachs. We will take action when I give the order.”\nJin Yang turned back to look at the three children who were chatting amongst themselves. He sighed imperceptibly.\n“If you didn’t want to forgive me, I won’t appear before you.”\nJin Yang looked in the direction of Qiu Tong’s ambush as he muttered to himself. His disappointed expression quickly returned to its usual coldness and calm.",

But at this moment, it was as if someone was secretly helping her. Everything was progressing smoothly. The firepower of the hooligans gradually weakened. Qiu Tong raised her hand with a murderous look. “Surround them!”\n“Yes!”\nSong Yan’s subordinates immediately surrounded the hooligans with guns and restrained them.\nUnable to escape, the hooligans panicked and fell into tumult. In the end, Song Yan’s subordinates easily captured them alive.\nAs the night fell, Qiu Tong looked at the hooligans, who numbered fifty in total. She assigned a portion of her men to guard them, while the rest followed her to support Song Yan and meet him at the mountaintop!\nThe road through the mountains was rather difficult to traverse. Qiu Tong hurried with some difficulty to the location where Song Yan had issued the signal flare. She saw the other hooligans tied up by the bonfire.\nSong Yan saw her and immediately went up to ask, “How’s the situation over there?”\n“We managed to ambush them. We need to send people to search the entire mountain to see if there are any survivors who managed to escape.”\nQiu Tong wiped the dirt and sweat from her face as she offered her combat advice.\nSong Yan expressed his agreement and summoned his subordinates to carry out the task.\nQiu Tong looked at the troops who had already temporarily set up camp and were resting. She suddenly looked around uneasily and asked nervously, “Where are the children? Why don’t I see them?”\nSong Yan had already been feeling that something was amiss. It was only after she reminded him that he realized he had not seen the children for a long time.\nHe hurriedly sent someone to look for the children.\nAlmost at the same time, one of his men rushed over with a flustered expression and reported, “Sir, the children are gone!”\nHe lowered his head guiltily when he saw Qiu Tong, his eyes avoiding hers.\nQiu Tong’s expression changed drastically when she heard that. She rushed to the subordinate and grabbed his collar, asking in a hoarse voice, “How did they disappear?”\nHis subordinate stole a glance at Song Yan and had no choice but to answer honestly, “I saw that the fight was at a critical stage and wanted to help. So I left the children behind a rock bunker and instructed them not to run around!”\n“But when I went back to fetch them, I realized that there was no one there anymore.”\n“There are only three messy sets of footprints on the ground. They seem to be heading towards the mountains…”\nQiu Tong’s lips turned pale. She turned around and glared at Song Yan. “This is what you meant by protecting them?!”\nSeeing Qiu Tong’s attitude towards Song Yan, the subordinate immediately defended him. “It’s my fault. It has nothing to do with Sir.”\nQiu Tong gritted her teeth and shook him off. She picked up a few submachine guns from the ground and strapped them onto her body. She then led Ke Le and the others to find the children.\nSong Yan looked at his subordinate coldly and said indifferently, “You failed in your mission. Go and receive your own punishment.”\nHis subordinate nodded in agreement, not daring to disobey or explain further.\nSong Yan assigned all his subordinates to search the mountain immediately. He shouted, “We have to find the children before it gets dark. Otherwise, you will all be punished!”\n“Yes.”\nHis subordinates didn’t dare to delay and scattered in all directions, diving into the forest and shouting the three children’s names.",

She stared at Song Yan coldly and said, “As the commander, I can understand why you didn’t have the time to look after them during a critical situation! But you did promise me at the start.”\n“You said that you would protect them! And now? You think you can dismiss me with just a few words of apology?”\n“Song Yan! If you can’t take responsibility for what you say, don’t make any promises…”\nQiu Tong stared at him with a dark expression and warned coldly, “If the children suffer any injuries, I won’t let you off!”\nSong Yan knew how serious this matter was to Qiu Tong. He could not argue with her, so he let go of her hand and said, “I’ve already arranged for people to search the entire mountain. We won’t miss out any hidden caves or corners.”\nQiu Tong looked at the camp and frowned as she thought of Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao. Even if they were in danger, they would think of a way to escape.\n“I’ll go back and see if they managed to find their own way back to camp…”\nQiu Tong gritted her teeth and quickened her pace towards the camp. Song Yan watched as her figure disappeared from view. He said fiercely to his subordinates, “What are you still standing here for? Go find the children!”\n…\nIn the house on the mountain, Jin Yang sat with the children in front of a warm charcoal brazier. The children’s faces were all red from the heat.\nThe fierce battle with the hooligans lasted for a long time. Little Yu covered her stomach with her hands, feeling a little hungry. She stole a glance at the snack bag hanging from the president’s guard’s waist. It smelled like beef. She swallowed her saliva greedily and quietly bit her lips to suppress her hunger.\nJin Yang noticed her strange behavior and smiled. He gestured for the guard to bring the food over and handed it to Little Yu. “Do you want to have something to eat?”\nLittle Yu shook her head reservedly and stole a glance at Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao’s faces. “Uncle Song Yan, will you feed me?”\n“I’ve touched a lot of dirty things outside. My hands are dirty!”\nLittle Yu deliberately stretched out her mud-stained hand and waved it in front of Jin Yang’s eyes. Jin Yang was helpless against the girl’s coquettishness and could only choose the most tender beef jerky and bring it to her mouth. Just as Little Yu was about to open her mouth to take a bite, Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao ran up to them and blocked it.\n“Sister, how could you betray us?”\nQiu Xingqiao stared at Little Yu in dismay. He stuffed his hand into the snack bag and drew out two strips of beef jerky to feed Little Yu.\n“Here, Second Brother will feed you!”\nLittle Yu pursed her lips tightly and dodged around Qiu Xingqiao. She covered her mouth with her hand and said, “Second Brother’s hands are dirty too!”\n“I want Uncle Song Yan to feed me…”\nWhen Jin Yang saw the children running crazily beside him, he could only resign himself to fate and let them treat him as a plaything. His face was filled with a blissful but troubled smile. When the president’s guards saw this scene, they all gaped in shock.\n“Second Brother is so naughty! Little Yu’s hair is all messy now. Uncle Song Yan, can you help me braid it?”\nLittle Yu was especially clingy as she sat in Jin Yang’s arms. Jin Yang had received a mission and was afraid of hurting the girl’s hair. His movements were stiff as he carefully arranged her hair into a comical but adorable style.\nThe president’s guards could not help bursting into laughter when they saw what the president had done with hair of the adorable little girl.",

      "content": "Chapter 164: Slap\nFollowing Jin Yang’s instructions, the president’s guard took out the food he carried with him. He distributed it to the three hungry children.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao sat on the bench and ate their food. There was no hint of harshness or disdain on their stubborn and determined faces.\nJin Yang could tell that Qiu Tong had taught them well. If Little Yu couldn’t finish her food, she would share it with her two brothers. Qiu Xingyuan would even pick up some food that had fallen to the ground and put them in his mouth. Sensing Jin Yang’s gaze, he explained awkwardly, “The locust plague hasn’t ended.”\n“Food is a precious thing. Those baddies only do bad things because they lack food…”\nWhen Jin Yang heard his words, his eyes flickered with admiration and relief as he rubbed Qiu Xingyuan’s head. “You did very well.”\nQiu Xingyuan’s small body was a little stiff, but he managed to quickly move away from Jin Yang’s touch. He smoothed his ruffled hair with a slightly disdainful expression.\n“It’s getting dark outside. I came from the other side of the mountain road and forgot the direction and location of the camp.”\n“Do you remember?”\nJin Yang asked. Qiu Xingqiao pointed to the east and said, “You can’t even find the camp?”\n“We entered the mountain from the east. The camp is behind the building. There are three rows of poplar trees surrounding that empty space. Their leaves are a little yellow!”\nQiu Xingqiao carefully described the many details surrounding the camp. Jin Yang turned to look at his guards. They immediately understood and went out to scout the way.\nA few minutes later, Jin Yang set off with the three children, wanting to send them back to the camp. He waited for Qiu Tong to appear before leaving.\nOutside the camp, Jin Yang did not see Qiu Tong. He knew that she had probably discovered that the children were gone and was searching the mountains.\nHe placed Little Yu firmly on the ground and made an excuse that he needed to check the situation on the battlefield. “You must stay here obediently and wait for Mommy to return. You can’t run around anymore, understand?”\nJin Yang instructed them, still feeling a little reluctant to leave the children. But Little Yu suddenly stuck her head out and looked behind him. She waved excitedly and shouted, “Mommy!”\nQiu Tong arrived at the camp just in time to see that the three children were standing there perfectly fine. She was so excited that she nearly fell over herself.\n“Where did you guys go? Are you alright? Are you hurt anywhere?”\nQiu Tong hugged Qiu Xingyu tightly and kissed her dirty face. She then turned to look at Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao and pulled them into her arms. The three children were a little breathless from being hugged by her. They could only raise their hands and pat her back weakly. “Mommy, cough cough!”\n“Where did you guys go?”\nQiu Tong repeated the question in a hoarse voice. Little Yu pointed at Jin Yang and said, “We’ve always been together with Uncle Song Yan.”\nJin Yang, “!”\nQiu Tong looked back and saw the figure that she had neglected to notice earlier.\nThey were with Song Yan all along?!\nWhat was all that about earlier then? Was Song Yan trying to trick her?\nQiu Tong stood up angrily and rushed in front of Jin Yang. She gritted her teeth and slapped him.\nSmack—\nThe clear sound frightened the children so much that they did not dare to speak. The president’s guards wanted to step forward, but saw Jin Yang’s secret gesture. They could only stand rooted to the ground.\n“Song Yan, what do you mean by this?”\n“Is it fun to trick me?”\nQiu Tong interrogated him sternly. She panted in agitation and stared fixedly at the change in Jin Yang’s expression.",

      "content": "Chapter 165: Protecting “Song Yan”\nQiu Tong used a lot of strength and left a clear mark on the side of Jin Yang’s face, which was quickly swelling up.\nJin Yang could feel the fear in Qiu Tong’s heart at the thought of losing her children. He didn’t want to reveal his identity by explaining himself.\nSong Yan’s warning lingered in Jin Yang’s ears, making him realize that his cover had been blown. Qiu Tong would never forgive him.\nAt the thought of this, Jin Yang lowered his head in silence and said, “I’m sorry.”\nHe did not try to explain himself, making it seem as if he was admitting his terrible prank. Qiu Tong’s anger towards him intensified.\nWhen Qiu Xingyu saw that Jin Yang had been slapped, she hurriedly ran to his side. She tugged at Jin Yang’s sleeve and explained to Qiu Tong, “Mommy, we secretly planned to sneak away. It has nothing to do with Uncle Song Yan!”\n“We wanted to help you, but we were afraid of being scolded, so we wanted to head back…”\n“But we met Uncle Song Yan on the way back. He didn’t do anything wrong! It’s wrong for Mommy to hit people.”\nLittle Yu stamped her feet in dismay. She took the initiative to grab Jin Yang’s sleeve. “Uncle Song Yan, does it hurt? Squat down!”\nSeeing that she was about to cry from anxiety, Jin Yang had no choice but to obediently squat down.\nQiu Xingyu used her hand to gently rub the mark on the side of his face. She pouted and blew at it. She muttered, “It won’t hurt if I blow on it!”\nJin Yang was so touched that his heart seemed to melt as he hugged her. “Uncle doesn’t feel any pain.”\nHe raised his slender fingers to wipe the tears off Little Yu’s face, not forgetting to speak up for Qiu Tong. “Mommy is worried about you guys, that’s why she’s so anxious. Uncle understands…” Qiu Tong widened her eyes in surprise. Was he pretending to be magnanimous now to win over her children?!\nAs expected, Little Yu turned to look at her with clear eyes, her expression a little resentful.\n“Come here!”\nQiu Tong placed her hands on her hips and ordered in a low voice.\nQiu Xingyuan saw Qiu Tong’s furious expression. He knew that this was happening only because they had run away. He took the initiative to step up and admit his mistake.\n“It really has nothing to do with him. He just happened to meet us.”\n“If you want to punish someone, punish me. I was the one who ran off with my siblings.”\nQiu Xingyuan wanted to shoulder all the blame. Qiu Xingqiao also put on a brave front and stood in front of Little Yu and Jin Yang. “I have a part in this too!”\nThese children seemed to all be on Song Yan’s side!\nDidn’t they know how dangerous the mountains were?!\nQiu Tong’s gradually quelling anger was once again ignited by their protective actions. She pulled Little Yu over and held her in the crook of one arm, before grabbing Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao also to drag them back towards the camp. “Looks like I have to let you kids suffer a little!”\nJin Yang looked at the lights in the camp and turned to leave bitterly.\nLate into the night, Song Yan and his men searched the mountains but could not find any trace of the children. He returned to the camp with regret and guilt.\nHe had just stepped into the camp when Little Yu ran out of the tent. She threw herself into Song Yan’s arms joyfully and hugged his neck especially intimately. “Uncle Song Yan, why are you only back now?”\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao’s attitude towards him also eased a little as they took the initiative to welcome him. They stood a couple of steps away and stared at him.\nSong Yan hugged Little Yu in surprise. Seeing that they were not injured, his worried heart gradually relaxed.",

      "content": "Chapter 166: Avoidance\nSong Yan asked his subordinates to stay and guard the surroundings of the camp. He placed Little Yu on the ground and kept a distance from her as he asked, “Where did you guys go? Are you injured? Do you need me to call a military doctor over to take a look?”\nWhen Qiu Xingyu heard his question, she blinked in confusion and asked, “Wasn’t it Uncle Song Yan who sent us back?”\n“Why did you run off and then come back again? Don’t you remember anything?”\nQiu Xingyu turned around and stole a glance in the direction of Qiu Tong’s tent. She widened her eyes as if she had guessed the answer. She said in a low voice, “Is Uncle still angry with Mommy? Mommy must have hit you very hard, right?”\n“Don’t blame her. Mommy regretted it after you left. She even secretly scanned the campsite for a long time!”\nQiu Xingyu tried to ease the awkward tension between them.\nSong Yan was stunned as he stood rooted to the ground. He did not understand Little Yu’s words and could only half-heartedly return to the tent to sort out his thoughts.\nQiu Tong heard movement outside the tent. She got up and saw Song Yan with the children.\nOver the past few days, Qiu Tong could sense that the children relied on him now. Even Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao’s attitude had changed.\nQiu Xingyuan’s willingness to stand up for Song Yan surprised Qiu Tong.\nAnnoyance and embarrassment flashed across her face as she pursed her red lips. Qiu Tong recalled her impulsive actions and frowned as she rubbed her own head.\nWhy did she slap Song Yan?\nFrom S City to the neighboring city, Song Yan was the one who helped them survive the difficult times.\nQiu Tong knew that it was normal for Song Yan to not be able to take care of the children while commanding an attack, but she still blamed him.\n“Why can’t I control my temper when it comes to the children?”\nQiu Tong sighed and picked up two cooked eggs before walking out of the tent. She looked at Song Yan from afar and explained awkwardly, “I was a little too agitated and went overboard. I’m sorry.”\n“Since the children were found safely, let’s forget about what happened before. Let’s not talk about it anymore.”\nA temporary light had been placed beside the tent, and Song Yan’s figure happened to be shrouded in shadow. Qiu Tong walked up to him with an egg in her hand and said, “Your face is still swollen, right? Roll an egg over the swollen area. It can reduce the swelling faster.”\n“Let me help you.”\nQiu Tong raised her hand to help Song Yan settle the matter. Song Yan instinctively waved her hand away. He turned around slightly and hid his face in the darkness.\n“I can do it myself…”\nQiu Tong looked at him in surprise and couldn’t help frowning as she tilted her head to look at him.\nSong Yan took the eggs from her hand and hurriedly replied in a low and hoarse voice, “I understand and I’m not angry. You don’t have to take that matter to heart.”\nSong Yan’s emotions were a little unstable. He pieced together Little Yu and Qiu Tong’s words and quickly came to a conclusion—Jin Yang had come!\nHe even communicated with Qiu Tong. Song Yan’s eyes surged with anger and conflicting emotions. He gripped the eggs tightly to suppress his emotions.\n“The children must have been shocked today. Stay with them.”\nSong Yan pushed Little Yu to Qiu Tong’s side, while he took two steps back to avoid Qiu Tong’s gaze, not letting her see his face.",

      "content": "Chapter 167: Teasing With Words\n“… If there’s nothing else, I still have to review today’s operation with my men. I’ll go back first.”\nSong Yan’s attitude and tone were cold and perfunctory as he turned around and returned to the tent. Qiu Tong was stunned, her eyes filled with disbelief.\nQiu Xingyu hooked Qiu Tong’s finger obediently and shook it twice to comfort her. “Uncle Song Yan is unhappy from the slap. Mommy has to understand!”\nQiu Xingyuan frowned in dissatisfaction when he saw that Qiu Tong’s sincere apology was met with Song Yan’s cold response.\nSomething was not right!\nQiu Tong looked up at the light source, before turning toward Song Yan’s tent. She subconsciously muttered to herself.\nShe had once lived during the post-apocalyptic era. The extremely dangerous environment had allowed Qiu Tong to gain excellent eyesight and observational skills. Even though she was in a dark environment with little light, she could still accurately capture everything within a two-meter radius and clearly remember every tiny detail!\nQiu Tong was certain that there were no finger marks on Song Yan’s face just now.\n“He shouldn’t have recovered so quickly. Unless he has supernatural powers…”\nQiu Tong shook her head to shake off the ridiculous thoughts that had flashed through her mind. She sent the children back to their room in the encampment and coaxed them to sleep.\nTaking advantage of the darkness of the night, Qiu Tong saw that Song Yan’s tent was still lit. She took the initiative to walk to the door with a glass of warm water and knocked lightly.\nSong Yan’s tall and slender figure went to the door but he did not open it. Instead, he asked in a clear voice, “What’s the matter?”\nQiu Tong didn’t expect to be refused entry. Thinking of Little Yu’s words, she said in an even more sincere tone, “I didn’t consider your feelings and embarrassed you in front of your subordinates, but I didn’t do it on purpose…”\n“The children are my weak spot. I can’t accept or tolerate any accidents happening to them.”\n“Since you promised me to take care of them, you should take responsibility for at least part of it. Why don’t we sit down and talk things out?”\nQiu Tong did not want to keep the conflict and resentment in her heart. So she was taking the initiative now, but Song Yan did not open the door.\n“It’s late at night and you want to come into my room? Are you planning to do something to me?”\n“The unrest caused by the hooligans has already been suppressed. If others see this, they might misunderstand our relationship.”\nSong Yan’s voice carried a hint of a smile as he said, “Of course, if you are indeed here with such intentions, I would be happy to invite you in. But you might end up staying the whole night and won’t be able to return.”\nQiu Tong was startled to see Song Yan already pressing down on the door handle. She hurriedly placed the glass of warm water on the ground. “Rest early.”\n“We’ll talk about our matter another day!”\nQiu Tong turned and left. Song Yan wiped the smile off his face. He brought the glass of warm water to the table in the room and dialed a familiar number on his phone.\nBeep beep beep—\nThree seconds later, the call connected.\nSong Yan pretended to be relaxed as he stuffed his hand into his pocket. He leaned against the table and gritted his teeth. “Since you are already here, let’s meet.”\nJin Yang knew his intentions and reported his location. Song Yan immediately rushed over.\nIn the dark night, two extremely similar faces stared at each other. Jin Yang opened his hand and gestured for Song Yan to take a seat, but Song Yan kicked the seat away. He looked at Jin Yang with a cold smile and asked, “What are your intentions?”",

Are those guards of yours all useless?”\n“The official residence isn’t good enough for you? Did you come into the mountains to look at the scenery? This place is not as comfortable as the presidential palace!”\nJin Yang pursed his thin lips and didn’t answer. Song Yan was not used to Jin Yang behaving so passively. He raised his eyebrows and said loudly, “You came to S City because of Qiu Tong. You couldn’t sit still when you heard that she might be in danger?”\n“I warned you, but you still appeared in front of Qiu Tong and looked after her children.”\n“Mr. President, are you interested in Qiu Tong? To put it bluntly, you like her!”\nSong Yan observed Jin Yang’s expression carefully, while Jin Yang recalled all sorts of things that had happened after he met Qiu Tong. She appeared cold, but she was actually a very soft-hearted woman. Jin Yang had started paying special attention to Qiu Tong’s actions some time ago, taking her seriously.\nThe intimate image of Song Yan and Qiu Tong appeared in Jin Yang’s mind. He frowned and said, “We met by chance.”\nSong Yan slammed the table in anger when Jin Yang did not admit or deny his feelings.\n“You’ve always been such a hypocrite since you were young!”\n“You always say that you won’t fight with me over anything. That you will always give me whatever I want. But in reality?”\nSong Yan raised his hand and pointed at Jin Yang’s face. His eyes were filled with indignance and anger as he gritted his teeth. “You snatched everything from me. Be it the position of president or the attention of our parents, you never left anything for me!”\n“Jin Yang, stop pretending. I’m not like Dad and Mom who are easily fooled by you. I’ve already seen through your true colors!”\nSong Yanshen adjusted his emotions and stared at Jin Yang’s silent expression. “I’ll give you one last chance.”\n“If you want me to believe you, don’t ever appear in front of Qiu Tong again. Otherwise… don’t blame me for what happens next.”\nSong Yan kicked aside the broken tables and chairs, walking over to Jin Yang’s side with cold eyes. He whispered into his ear, “This time, I hope you won’t lie to me or disappoint me!”\nJin Yang felt a wave of helplessness. He had no way of explaining. Faced with Song Yan’s anger and bullying, he could only choose to retreat.\n“Okay, I promise.”\nAfter receiving Jin Yang’s answer, Song Yan turned around and left without another word.\n…\nThe next morning, all the hooligans in the neighboring city had been eliminated. There would be no future trouble.\nQiu Tong woke the children up for a simple breakfast, planning to return to S City with Song Yan.\nWhen she arrived at the tent with the porridge, she realized that Song Yan’s tent was empty.\nQiu Tong was about to stop a guard beside her to inquire when one of Song Yan’s subordinates took the initiative to walk to her side. He said respectfully, “Sir has something to do and will leave first. He has ordered us to escort Miss Qiu and the children back to S City. We can set off at any time after you pack up.”\n“When did he leave?”\nQiu Tong frowned as she looked at the daily necessities Song Yan had left behind. She speculated that he had left in a hurry and felt increasingly puzzled.\nSong Yan’s subordinate kept a straight face, his expression cold and serious. He refused to say anything else. “Miss Qiu, please don’t make things difficult for us.”",

      "content": "Chapter 169: Coincidental Encounter At The Airport\nAt the airport terminal, the plane to S City was at the airport, waiting for the passengers to check their tickets.\nQiu Xingyuan stared at the heavy-duty planes outside the airport, his eyes filled with confusion. From time to time, he would steal glances at Qiu Tong, but he could not bring himself to ask.\nQiu Tong saw through his intentions and took the initiative to walk to his side. She pointed at the heavy-duty planes and said, “These are all modified military models. Although you can’t tell just by looking, judging from the smoothness of the machines and the gun barrels still attached, they should be from the batch that was eliminated three years ago. They belong to the same batch as the modified drones.”\n“But why are they at a civilian airport?”\nQiu Xingyuan asked with furrowed brows. When Qiu Xingqiao overheard their conversation, he came over to eavesdrop with interest.\nQiu Tong recalled what had happened and looked up at the VIP room. “It might be used to transport those hooligans.”\nThe doubts between Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao’s brows dissipated. Their attitude towards Qiu Tong changed slightly, and they looked at her with admiration.\n“Uncle Song Yan?”\nLittle Yu sat on a chair in boredom, swinging her legs. With her excellent eyesight, she spotted a familiar figure in front of her.\nQiu Tong followed her gaze and froze in surprise—why was he here?!\nJin Yang also sensed Qiu Tong’s gaze. He remembered his promise to Song Yan, but it was too late to turn around and hide.\n“They said that you had something to do and left first?”\n“Why aren’t there any guards with you? Where are your subordinates? Where did they go?”\nQiu Tong blurted out in confusion as she quickly blocked Jin Yang’s path.\nJin Yang knew that he couldn’t avoid her, so he lied and replied perfunctorily, “There was a last-minute cancelation in my itinerary. But my men were already sent over.”\nQiu Tong raised her eyebrows, but when she saw the faint mark on the side of Jin Yang’s face, her expression changed to astonishment. She could not help feeling puzzled.\nWhy would the mark disappear and reappear again?\nQiu Tong raised her hand, wanting to touch the mark, but Jin Yang instinctively dodged.\nAn awkward atmosphere surged between them. Qiu Tong lowered her hand to her side and was about to say something when the airport broadcast urged the passengers to board the plane. Qiu Tong led the children to check their tickets as Jin Yang followed them into the cabin.\nAccording to the seat number on the boarding pass, Qiu Tong noticed that Jin Yang was sitting in the same row as them. They would be sitting next to each other.\nQiu Xingyuan’s sharp eyes could tell that something was amiss. He signaled to Qiu Xingqiao with his eyes and suddenly said, “I’m a little airsick and need to sit in a seat by the aisle.”\nQiu Xingqiao noted his signal and took the initiative to tug at Qiu Tong’s sleeve. “I’m a little scared. I want to sit next to you.”\nQiu Tong saw that the usually independent children were being strangely clingy. She turned to look at Jin Yang.\nQiu Xingyuan said in a low voice, “Uncle won’t fight with us for seats, right?”\nQiu Xingqiao did not say anything else. He just pulled Qiu Tong to sit down and sandwiched her between himself and Qiu Xingyuan. They looked at Jin Yang warily like two bodyguards.\nQiu Xingyuan took the initiative to fasten Qiu Tong’s seatbelt and reminded her stiffly, “Safety first!”\nQiu Tong was stunned by their attentions. She blinked and looked at Jin Yang.\nWhy did she feel like she was being treated like an object?!",

According to the boarding pass, they should be sitting together!”\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao looked a little awkward, but they tried their best to explain themselves. “We are young and need to be accompanied by our parent.”\nDid Qiu Xingyuan actually call her his “parent”?\nQiu Tong smirked in surprise. The commotion from their group attracted the attention of the surrounding passengers, who whispered praises of the children’s intelligence and cuteness.\nFaced with the two children’s hostility, Jin Yang had no choice but to carry Little Yu and sit on the other side.\n“Uncle Song Yan, don’t be disheartened. Little Yu will secretly help you.”\nQiu Xingyu felt that he did not seem like Yu Ge or any other man. He treated Qiu Tong and them well and was genuine about it. As a result, Little Yu’s heart was tipping in favor of him. Jin Yang was comforted by her. Warmth surged in his heart as he rubbed the top of her head and took the initiative to fasten her seatbelt.\nThe flight took off. Qiu Tong watched the interaction between Little Yu and Jin Yang and felt her eyelids grow heavy.\nThe battle with the hooligans in the neighboring city had exhausted a lot of her energy. Last night, Qiu Tong was worried that the children would run around again. She could not sleep due to the guilt she felt towards Song Yan. At this moment, she could not bear it anymore and closed her eyes.\nAmidst the noise in the cabin, Qiu Tong nodded off from time to time, her body swaying uncontrollably.\nSeeing that she was dozing off, Qiu Xingyuan raised his hand to hold her head so that she could sleep more comfortably. However, he put them down just before he made contact with her. With an awkward expression, he straightened his body and tried to use his shoulder to support her, but he was not tall enough.\nQiu Xingyuan’s movements attracted the attention of Little Yu and Qiu Xingqiao.\nQiu Xingyuan clenched his fists and coughed lightly. He deliberately looked elsewhere and pretended to be oblivious.\nLittle Yu whispered nervously, “Mommy will be very uncomfortable sleeping like this!”\nShe quickly shot Qiu Xingyuan a look, wanting him to exchange seats with Jin Yang so that he could support Qiu Tong.\nHowever, Qiu Xingyuan had finally managed to separate the two of them, so he was naturally unwilling. He looked at Song Yan doubtfully. He kept feeling that this man was very suspicious and was not a good person worth their trust!\nQiu Xingyuan’s stubbornness and persistence angered Little Yu so much that she stuck her hands at her waist. She quietly pointed at Qiu Tong and mimicked her actions, gently rocking her head around. Little Yu frowned and stared at Qiu Xingyuan, urging him to quickly change seats.\nQiu Xingyuan looked at Qiu Tong with a hesitant and conflicted expression. She had eyebags and she looked exhausted.\nThis woman had not had a good rest recently and even ran across the entire mountain for them.\nQiu Xingyuan sighed and undid his seatbelt. He went over to Jin Yang’s side. “Please take care of her…”\nJin Yang helped Qiu Xingyuan to secure his seatbelt before turning around to return to Qiu Tong’s side.\nAt this moment, turbulence rocked the plane. Qiu Tong had unbuckled her seatbelt earlier to get into a more comfortable sleeping position. As a result, her body flew forward. Seeing this, Jin Yang hurriedly sat down and caught Qiu Tong’s head with his shoulder.\nThe three children looked over in unison and saw the slightly amorous postures of the two adults.. Different emotions flashed across each of their eyes.",

      "content": "Chapter 171: Cabin Dream\nIn her sleep, Qiu Tong seemed to have found a comfortable support. She gently rubbed Jin Yang’s shoulder and took the initiative to hold his arm as she continued to sleep.\nJin Yang sat up stiffly, not daring to move an inch. He could feel Qiu Tong’s steady breathing on his neck. His heartbeat followed her breathing rhythm and in just a few minutes, his palms were covered in a thin layer of sweat.\nJin Yang raised his hand to support Qiu Tong’s neck and her face, allowing her to sleep more comfortably.\nIn the noisy cabin, Jin Yang was also gradually getting sleepy under Qiu Tong’s influence. He closed his eyes and leaned back in his seat.\nIn his half-asleep state, Jin Yang suddenly recalled some vague memories.\nIn the past, there seemed to have been a woman who used to lean against him like this. Her stomach bulged slightly and Jin Yang gently placed his hand on it.\n“You’re going to be a father soon. Are you happy?”\nJin Yang felt his heart ache. He wanted to see the woman’s face clearly, but it was as if there were layers of mist surrounding her.\nA gentle breeze blew past. Through the mist, Jin Yang saw that the woman’s eyes vaguely resembled Qiu Tong’s. He wanted to take a closer look, but a sharp pain came from his temples. He covered his head in pain, and his abrupt actions woke Qiu Tong up.\nQiu Tong saw that it was Jin Yang beside her. She was surprised to see his pained expression and hurriedly rubbed his temples to relieve the pain.\nJin Yang narrowed his eyes and gripped Qiu Tong’s wrist tightly. He shook his head lightly and said, “Don’t go!”\nQiu Tong looked at him strangely. She could sense Jin Yang’s desire to keep her. She comforted him softly, “Song Yan? What’s wrong?”\nHer voice woke Jin Yang up from his trance. He pushed Qiu Tong’s hand away awkwardly and tidied his messy clothes. “Sorry.”\nJin Yang realized that he had lost his composure earlier. Seeing Qiu Tong’s worried gaze, he could only try to offer an excuse. “I had a nightmare just now.”\nQiu Tong did not probe further. A strange silence descended between them.\nWhy did memories that didn’t belong to him keep appearing in his mind?\nAnd those memories were very clear. All the details were very real, including the emotions and scents…\nJin Yang’s gaze landed on Qiu Tong. From the first time they met, Qiu Tong gave him an inexplicable sense of familiarity.\nEvery time he interacted more intimately with her, Jin Yang would recall some memory fragments.\nThis influence was becoming increasingly intense and had gone beyond Jin Yang’s control.\nJin Yang pursed his thin lips and sat up straight. He wanted to keep a distance from the woman beside him and cut off this connection.\nBut he heard Qiu Tong cough and couldn’t help asking, “Do you have a cold?”\n“No. Maybe it’s just that the cabin is a little dry and my body isn’t used to it.”\nQiu Tong replied hoarsely, feeling a little dizzy.\nThe attendant pushed a cart over from behind. Qiu Tong saw her distributing drinks and wanted to get a glass of warm water.\nQiu Tong raised her hand, but a brat sitting in the row behind her stood up noisily.\nThe brat was holding a plastic cup filled with warm water. Ignoring his parents’ attempts to stop him, he continued to fuss and jump around.\nSplash—\nThe plane rocked again and he lost his balance, splashing the warm water all over Qiu Tong’s back…\nThe brat’s parents stood up in a panic and apologized, “I’m sorry!”\nThe mother looked at Qiu Tong’s wet shirt and handed her a tissue to wipe off the water.",

He looked at Qiu Tong and said timidly, “I’m sorry.”\nQiu Tong didn’t fuss with the child. She just waved her hand and said that it was fine.\nShe took out some clothes from her backpack and went to change in the washroom. After some thought, Jin Yang followed her to the door and waited.\nQiu Tong did not expect him to be so considerate. In the cramped space, she took off her wet shirt and placed it to the side. She then picked up a brand new white shirt to change into it. As she was in a hurry earlier, she did not realize that she had picked a shirt with a zipper on the back.\nShe looked at the mirror and tried to tug at the zipper, but ended up catching her hair inside the zipper. Qiu Tong could not pull it out by herself, so she called out softly to Jin Yang.\n“Can you come in and help me?”\nJin Yang was leaning against the door with his arms crossed. When he heard the voice, he pushed the door open in surprise.\nIn the small space, their bodies were almost pressed against each other. Jin Yang lowered his head and gently pulled her hair out. He swallowed hard, feeling a little hot. He shifted his gaze away from Qiu Tong’s bare back, but ended up looking at her reflection in the mirror.\nThe front collar of her shirt had fallen to her shoulders and was very low, revealing the top part of Qiu Tong’s chest.\nJin Yang could hear his heart beating faster. He lowered his head and wanted to quickly pull up the zipper. The two of them were startled when his cold fingers touched Qiu Tong’s skin. The amorous atmosphere in the confined space was so thick that their ears turned red.\n“Are you done?”\nQiu Tong asked in a hoarse voice. Jin Yang restrained his thoughts and sped up. A thin layer of sweat broke out on his forehead as he tried his best to control his instinct to help arrange her shirt properly.\nWith lowered heads, they were about to leave the washroom when the plane suddenly rocked.\nJin Yang saw that Qiu Tong was swaying unsteadily and he reached out to hold her.\nWhen the plane stabilized again, Jin Yang looked down to ask Qiu Tong if she was okay, but he realized that her chest was pressed tightly against hisâ€¦\nQiu Tong was pressed against the mirror by Jin Yang. Behind her was the cold mirror, while in front of her was Jin Yang’s burning skin.\nHis heavy and hurried breathing explained everything. Qiu Tong could feel the intense pheromones emanating from the man in front of her.\nNeither of them spoke. Jin Yang had forgotten to fasten the safety catch of the zipper and it started to slide downâ€¦\nWhen Jin Yang saw the lovely sight before him, he finally lost control and lowered his head to kiss her red lips.\nHe used his hand to gently cup Qiu Tong’s cheek, not giving her any chance to dodge or resist. At this moment, Jin Yang didn’t want to think about anything else. He just wanted to taste the woman in front of him. Qiu Tong opened her eyes slightly and looked at Jin Yang’s handsome face, recalling all the things they had experienced.\nRead latest Chapters at W u xiaWorld.Site Only\nAll sorts of emotions spread uncontrollably in her heart.\nJin Yang bit her lower lip lightly. Qiu Tong could sense his emotional state. She lifted her chin slightly in assent.\nQiu Tong wanted to raise her arms and hug Jin Yang’s neck, to respond to him and deepen the kiss.\nJin Yang looked at himself in the mirror and recalled Song Yan and his promise to him. That guilt instantly snapped him out of his trance.\nHe looked into Qiu Tong’s lustful eyes and stiffly pushed her shoulders away. He helped arrange her shirt properly and left in a hurry..\n••••",

      "content": "Chapter 173: Going To Have A Stepfather\nQiu Tong steadied herself in the washroom and returned to the cabin. She wanted to pretend that nothing had happened, but whenever her eyes met Jin Yang’s, she would subconsciously avoid them.\nWhen Jin Yang saw her return, he stood up so that she could move into the inner seat.\nThe attendant just happened to be pushing a food cart down the aisle, making it a tight squeeze. Jin Yang held Qiu Tong’s elbow and put his other hand on her waist, wanting to support her. Qiu Tong felt the warmth of his palm and immediately looked up at him…\nTheir eyes met. Jin Yang let go apologetically and sat beside her in silence.\nEven though they did not mention what had just happened, their evasive looks revealed much.\nQiu Xingyu rubbed her sleepy eyes and looked at Qiu Tong. Seeing that her lips were a little swollen, Little Yu asked innocently, “Mommy, why is your mouth swollen? I think you were bitten!”\nQiu Tong glanced at Jin Yang hurriedly and replied perfunctorily, “Mommy has lipitis. It’s alright.”\nLittle Yu nodded, believing in Qiu Tong’s explanation. She seriously explained, “Lipitis might be due to a lack of vitamins in the body. When we get back, I’ll get Eldest Brother to help Mommy prepare some ointment that can reduce inflammation and protect the lips. It’ll definitely be more effective than those sold outside!”\n“Mommy, don’t worry. You will be fine soon.”\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao looked at each other. They did not believe in Qiu Tong’s explanation. They were not as easy to deceive as Little Yu.\nThey looked at Jin Yang and a thought popped up in their minds at the same time—it seemed like they were really going to have a stepfather!\nQiu Xingyuan sized up Jin Yang’s face and figure seriously. From time to time, the female passengers in front would turn their heads to steal glances at Jin Yang. Qiu Xingyuan frowned as Jin Yang’s image decreased a few notches in his heart. He was dissatisfied with everything he saw.\nSensing Qiu Xingyuan’s gaze on Jin Yang, Little Yu sneaked over to his side and muttered softly, “Uncle Song Yan is so handsome, right? Elder Brother looks somewhat similar to Uncle, but Uncle Song Yan is more manly and can protect Mommy.”\nQiu Xingyu had completely defected to the “other side”. Qiu Xingyuan deliberately refuted, “How is he handsome?”\n“I don’t look like him at all. He looks quite old. There are already wrinkles at the corners of his eyes.”\n“Don’t you realize that he’s always putting on airs? He’s not easy going at all. Anyone who has to live with him will definitely feel uncomfortable!”\nHearing Qiu Xingyuan’s ridicule, Little Yu quietly said, “I think Elder Brother behaves like that too.”\nQiu Xingyuan choked on his words. He turned his head to look at the white clouds outside the window in a huff, but he could not help turning back to stare at Jin Yang again.\n…\nAt the airport in S City, Qiu Tong waited with the children for their luggage to be sent out.\nA passerby standing beside them casually mentioned the news of a riot in the prison. “Have you heard? A few prisoners seemed to have been killed or injured in the riot. I think a few of them even sneaked out. I wonder if they were caught.”\n“That’s right. We have to be careful these days!”\nQiu Tong thought of Qiu Rong, who was in prison. She wanted to send the children back to the villa before rushing to the prison to investigate the situation.\nHowever, Qiu Xingyuan seemed to have guessed her thoughts. He raised his little face and said firmly, “We want to go with you!”",

      "content": "Chapter 174: Visiting The Prison\nIn S City’s prison, Mayor Shen rushed out to welcome Qiu Tong and her group.\nWhen Mayor Shen saw Qiu Tong’s anxious expression, he hurriedly explained, “Mr. Qiu is fine. He has been transferred to a separate cell.”\n“I’ll arrange for you to meet him now. No one will disturb you!”\nQiu Tong heaved a sigh of relief after confirming that Qiu Rong was safe and sound. She thanked Mayor Shen and followed him to the guest room.\nQiu Rong sat on the chair nervously. He heard the door open and stood up.\nLittle Yu smiled brightly and threw herself into Qiu Rong’s arms, calling him “Grandpa” coquettishly. Qiu Rong bent over and stroked her face, his old face filled with joy and excitement.\nQiu Xingyu giggled and reached out to touch Qiu Rong’s stubble. “It’s a little ticklish!”\nSeeing that he was safe and sound, Qiu Tong gently pushed Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao over to Qiu Rong’s side. “I heard that there was a riot in the prison? Why did Mayor Shen transfer you to a separate cell? Is there something wrong?”\nQiu Rong was a little hesitant, but he still chose to tell her the whole story.\n“I was almost murdered by a fellow cell-mate. If not for Song Yan, I might have died.”\nQiu Tong was shocked and somewhat surprised. She recalled that on the afternoon of the prison riot, she had clearly been with Song Yan.\nThey rushed to the neighboring city together. How could Song Yan have had the opportunity to appear in prison and save Qiu Rong?\nQiu Tong noticed something amiss and wanted to probe further about the details of the incident, but Jin Yang strode into the guest room and interrupted her.\n“Mr. Qiu might have remembered the time wrongly. The riot in the prison happened in the morning…”\n“I settled things here before meeting up with you.”\nJin Yang shot Qiu Rong a look before deliberately changing the topic. “That previous cell was dark and cramped. It’s not suitable for long-term accommodation.”\n“Mr. Qiu, how is your current room? If you need anything else, you can ask the warden. They will help you with it.”\nQiu Rong hesitated for a moment, but he quickly felt that Jin Yang’s words made sense. He rubbed his forehead and explained to Qiu Tong, “It’s possible that I remembered wrongly. You know that after living here for a long time, your memory will inevitably get messed up.”\n“My current room is very good. There’s no need to trouble them anymore.”\nQiu Tong looked at Jin Yang’s face. The doubts in her heart intensified, and a strange feeling welled up.\nEveryone chatted for a while in the guest room before Qiu Tong left with the three children.\nJust as they were about to leave the prison, the warden ran over with a prepared name list and reported to Jin Yang about the progress of their investigation.\n“Additional punishment and labor reform are already being carried out on the prisoners who caused trouble.”\n“However, the prisoners who managed to escape are still at large. We haven’t managed to capture them yet. Nevertheless, none of them are hardcore criminals. We’ve already distributed their photos and arrest warrants. The moment we get any leads, we’ll immediately arrest them.”\n“This is a list of the escaped prisoners. I think there’s someone called Yu Ge…”\nThe warden found out that the reason for Yu Ge’s imprisonment was related to Qiu Tong, so he specially mentioned it.\nWhen Qiu Tong heard that Yu Ge had escaped from prison, her expression turned solemn and guarded, worried that he would come looking for trouble.",

He hurriedly said, “Warden, Dina has escaped!”\nWhen Qiu Tong heard Dina’s name, she looked up at the prison guard and asked, “Why did you only notice now?”\nThe prison guard explained awkwardly, “There was someone lying in Dina’s bed the whole time. We didn’t notice anything unusual when we searched. We thought that he was just feeling unwell. But when we counted all the prisoners who escaped, we realized that there were two names who didn’t match…”\n“Dina probably escaped on the day of the riot, but hired a subordinate to replace him.”\nThe prison guard wanted to escape responsibility, but Jin Yang said with a cold expression, “He’s an important criminal, the leader of a terrorist organization.”\n“Dina’s escape must be taken seriously. Send someone to search the entire city immediately. Don’t let him escape.”\nThe warden was so nervous that he hurriedly dispatched the police officers. Jin Yang turned to look at Qiu Tong and the children. He felt that they were in danger in S City, so he took the initiative to say, “I’ll send you back.”\nQiu Tong didn’t refuse. Little Yu happily clung to Jin Yang, holding his hand tightly, unwilling to let go.\nIn the villa area, Ke Le and the other mercenaries had already tidied up the house. Jin Yang stopped at the door and rubbed the top of Little Yu’s head gently. “You have to be careful. Don’t run around. When Dina and the rest are arrested and brought back to the prison, I’ll send someone to inform you.”\nQiu Tong nodded, but Little Yu hugged Jin Yang’s leg, reluctantly to let him go. She raised her pink face and asked in a childish voice, “Can Uncle Song Yan stay?”\n“Can you stay and play with Little Yu for a while?”\nQiu Xingyu looked at Jin Yang expectantly. Jin Yang explained awkwardly, “I have something else to do.”\n“After a while, if I have time, I will come back to see Little Yu. Be good and listen to Mommy and your brothers.”\nJin Yang wanted to coax Little Yu, but she shook her head vehemently. She threw herself at Jin Yang’s waist and threw a tantrum.\n“But I don’t want Uncle Song Yan to leave!”\n“Mommy doesn’t want that either, right?”\nQiu Xingyu tried to find support. Jin Yang stood rooted to the ground, not knowing how to face a girl’s tears.\nQiu Tong looked at them in confusion. She met Jin Yang’s gaze and smiled awkwardly. She moved over to pull Qiu Xingyu back.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao initially despised Little Yu’s reliance on Jin Yang. But when they saw their sister crying, they instantly became very anxious.\nTheir sister had always been adorable and strong. When had they ever seen her cry so fiercely?\nThe two boys looked at each other. They knew that Little Yu really wanted Jin Yang to stay.\nQiu Xingyuan cleared his throat and suggested softly, “Why don’t you carry Little Yu into the house first? She won’t stop crying and it is very chilly outside. She will definitely catch a cold.”\nWhen Jin Yang heard his words, he quickly bent over and carried Little Yu into the villa.\nLittle Yu leaned on Jin Yang’s shoulder. She smiled brightly and blinked at Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao, before sticking out her tongue.\nQiu Xingyuan’s small body heaved a sigh. “I really don’t know what to do with her.”",

Qiu Xingyu hurried upstairs to find some toys to play with him. “Uncle Song Yan, wait for me!”\nQiu Tong went to the kitchen to prepare some snacks and warm water for them. Jin Yang took the opportunity while Little Yu was gone to walk to the kitchen door.\nHe looked at Qiu Tong’s busy back profile and frowned slightly, saying, “I’ll go back first.”\nQiu Tong paused in her actions and turned around, suppressing her disappointment. She maintained a calm expression and said, “Alright.”\n“Be careful on the road.”\nJin Yang wanted to reach out to take the glass of warm water, but in the end, he retracted his fingers and replied with a faint smile, “You too.”\nOutside the villa, Jin Yang sat in the driver’s seat. He tried to start the car engine but each attempt ended in failure.\nHe got out of the car with a puzzled expression to check the situation. He discovered that the car’s engine had been burnt. It had been damaged to the point where it could not be activated anytime soon.\nFrom the corner of his eye, Jin Yang saw two little figures hiding behind the car. He sighed helplessly and walked over to pull Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao out.\n“You guys did this?”\nJin Yang pointed at the engine. Qiu Xingyuan struggled to break free from his grip. He pretended to be stupid and said, “We just came out for a walk.”\n“Did you see who damaged this car?”\nQiu Xingyuan pretended to be serious as he asked Qiu Xingqiao. Of course, Qiu Xingqiao shook his head firmly. “No! We are just children. How could we possibly damage this big machine? We are all very obedient. We don’t know how to cause damage to an engine…”\nJin Yang looked at them in amusement and said helplessly, “Looks like this is all fate, right?”\nQiu Xingqiao nodded vigorously. “Yes, yes! In that case, we have no choice but to let you stay for another night.”\nQiu Xingyuan sensed Jin Yang’s gaze on him and turned away with a cold snort. He muttered softly, “If not for Little Yu, this car wouldn’t have broken down and there wouldn’t be a place for you to stay at our house.”\nJin Yang overheard his muttering and laughed.\nHe squatted down and pulled Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao in front of him.\nJin Yang took out a handkerchief from his pocket and gently wiped the two children’s blackened faces, which they had dirtied while messing with the engine. The clean white handkerchief was quickly stained pitch-black. Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao looked at each other in shock and realized that the evidence of their “crime” had long been written on their faces!\nHowever, Jin Yang didn’t expose them. Instead, he played along with them.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao were a little moved. Their impression of Jin Yang changed slightly, but they remained stubborn and did not say anything.\nJin Yang stood up and reminded the two children, “Next time, remember to wrap things up properly. Don’t leave behind such obvious evidence.”\n“The easiest way to destroy a car is to destroy its starter. Just a small adjustment on the inside…”\n“Don’t do such dangerous things anymore!”\nJin Yang rubbed the top of Qiu Xingyuan’s head as he brought the two children home.\nIn the living room, Little Yu was crying as she hugged Qiu Tong. She was also clutching her favorite doll. Little Yu wiped her snot and tears on Qiu Tong and cried, “Why didn’t Mommy help me stop Uncle Song Yan?”\n“He promised Little Yu that he would stay behind to play with me!”\n“Uncle Song Yan is a liar!”",

When they saw Jin Yang return, their expressions instantly turned to surprise and joy. Little Yu ran out of Qiu Tong’s embrace and rushed straight into Jin Yang’s arms. “Uncle Song Yan!”\n“You’re not allowed to leave tonight! You promised Little Yu to stay. You can’t lie anymore!”\n“Otherwise, I won’t forgive you in the future.”\nHelpless, Jin Yang hugged her and whispered to Qiu Tong what the two children had done. “Even if I want to leave, I can’t.”\nQiu Tong met his gaze. Although the two of them did not say anything, their emotions surged. The corners of her lips curled up slightly.\nJin Yang stayed in the living room to play with the children. Qiu Tong was in the kitchen prepping some ingredients from the fridge. She wanted to prepare a sumptuous dinner for them.\nQiu Tong heated up a pan and was about to fry some eggs when she realized that she could not find the egg molds!\n“Who knows where the egg molds are?”\nQiu Tong rummaged around in a panic when she saw that smoke was already rising from the pan.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao blinked and shook their heads at the same time.\nJin Yang carried Little Yu to the kitchen door and pointed at the second drawer. “They should be in there.”\nQiu Tong was taken aback by his confident answer. Doubtful, she bent over and rummaged through the drawer. She saw that the egg molds were indeed at the place Jin Yang had mentioned. She quickly cracked the eggs into the pan with the molds and skillfully cooked them. “Are you a wizard?”\n“You can conjure up everything that goes missing?”\nQiu Tong teased in a relaxed tone. Jin Yang wiped some cream off the corner of Little Yu’s mouth with his fingertips and replied in a very natural tone, “You always used to stash the egg molds in the second drawer and then forget about it. You will end up buying more when you can’t find them…”\nA strange silence fell over the villa.\nAlert, Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao pricked up their ears to listen to their conversation. Little Yu quickly blinked and turned to look at Qiu Tong.\nQiu Tong adjusted the stove fire to a smaller flame and turned to look at Jin Yang. Her eyes were filled with mockery as she asked, “You seem to know my habits very well? It’s as if we’ve lived together for a long time.”\n“Even Ke Le probably won’t even remember where I keep the egg molds… how did you know?”\nJin Yang also didn’t know where he got his memories from. He had spoken those words very naturally. But when faced with Qiu Tong’s question, he gave a perfunctory excuse and said, “I was just guessing, because you searched all the other places in the kitchen, leaving only the second drawer untouched.”\nQiu Tong didn’t believe him, but she just focused on cooking and let go of this difficult-to-explain topic.\nJin Yang carried Little Yu back to the living room. Qiu Tong watched his departing figure and frowned as she stir-fried the vegetables in the pan.\nAmidst the aroma of the dishes, Qiu Tong muttered to herself comfortingly, “It might just be a coincidence.”\n“Many people have the same habits. Maybe the women he used to know are very similar to me…”\nQiu Tong took two deep breaths and ladled the food out. She called Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao over to help. “Let’s eat!”",

      "content": "Chapter 178: Parent-Child Time\nThe setting sun shone in from the window and the living room was filled with warmth. Jin Yang carried Little Yu, who was clinging onto him, to the French windows to admire the sunset.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao were huddled on the sofa. They looked gloomily at their sister, who had completely forgotten about them.\nAt this time after dinner every day, the three of them would play games. Qiu Xingyuan never expected to fall out of his sister’s favor!\nHe cleared his throat to attract the attention of Jin Yang and Qiu Xingyu. “Sister, you haven’t done the art homework assigned by the kindergarten teacher.”\n“The teacher will scold you tomorrow at the kindergarten!”\nQiu Xingyu pursed her lips and lowered her head. “But it’s so difficult to fold paper animals!”\nQiu Xingqiao wanted to make things difficult for Jin Yang. He lifted his chin and placed a stack of folding papers on the coffee table in the living room. “Isn’t he here?”\n“The other children in the kindergarten can’t do it either, but their fathers can!”\n“A few days ago, Little Fatty bragged that his father was very skilled in making tigers and lions…”\nQiu Xingqiao snorted awkwardly. He crossed his arms and turned around. However, he did not forget to steal a glance at Jin Yang. “If you want to be our stepfather, you must know how to coax our sister! At the very least, you must help her finish her homework!”\nJin Yang did not expect that he would encounter this test by the children. He raised his eyebrows slightly and stared at the folding paper in silence.\nLittle Yu’s eyes flickered with anticipation as she shook Jin Yang’s fingers. She asked in a childish voice, “Uncle will definitely be able to do it, right?”\nHow could Jin Yang bear to disappoint Qiu Xingyu?\nHe sat cross-legged on the ground and studied the instructions carefully.\nAlthough Jin Yang didn’t have experience with this type of children stuff, he quickly folded exquisite animals such as deer, tigers and lions according to the instructions. His slender fingers carefully pressed the edges of the folding paper. The entire process was completed in one go without any need for corrections…\nQiu Xingyu widened her eyes and kept clapping. She hurriedly stood up and threw herself into Jin Yang’s arms. She hugged his neck and kissed him twice.\n“Uncle is indeed the best! Uncle can do anything!”\nWhen Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao saw the paper animals, they could not find anything to nitpick on. The two brothers had no choice but to sit there and sulk.\nLittle Yu did not hide her admiration and love for Jin Yang. She gently tugged at Jin Yang’s fingers and muttered softly, “If only Uncle is our father. That way, we can be together every day!”\n“Will Uncle always be with us? Will you abandon us and Mommy?”\nTraumatized by her earlier experiences, Qiu Xingyu asked this question with some trepidation. Jin Yang recalled his promise to Song Yan and his expression stiffened slightly. He then replied perfunctorily, “I will always protect you.”\nQiu Tong watched the three of them interact harmoniously in the kitchen, her eyes filled with gentleness and comfort.\nShe rinsed the foam off her hands with fresh water. Another ridiculous thought popped into her head. “Could he really be the children’s father?”\nQiu Tong frowned as she stared at Jin Yang. However, she recalled his insistence that they had never met before and so dismissed this conjecture. “Perhaps it’s just a coincidence?” Qiu Tong muttered to herself as she walked to the living room to play with Jin Yang.",

Qiu Tong prepared a cup of warm milk for everyone as per the family custom.\nQiu Tong stood outside the room and knocked lightly on the door, but she did not hear any response. She frowned and guessed if Jin Yang had something to do and had left again.\nShe twisted the door lock tentatively and entered the guest room. She heard the sound of water splashing in the bathroom.\nJin Yang turned off the shower and raised his hand to sweep his wet hair over his head. He casually picked up a towel and wrapped his lower body with it as he walked out. Droplets of water trickled down his abs and landed on the tile. The temperature in the room suddenly rose. Qiu Tong instinctively avoided his gaze, her pupils trembling a little.\n“Is that for me?”\nJin Yang was a little surprised by her appearance here, but he quickly broke the tension by asking that question, wanting to accept the glass of milk from her.\nQiu Tong’s ears turned red as she turned to put the milk on the bedside table. With her back facing Jin Yang, she hurriedly explained, “I knocked on the door.”\n“But there was no answer. I just wanted to come in and take a look. I thought you already left…”\nQiu Tong’s voice tightened. Just as she was about to leave with the tray, she bumped into the corner of the double bed.\nJin Yang saw that she was in so much pain that she was about to fall to the ground. He hurriedly rushed forward and reached out to pull her into his arms.\nQiu Tong instinctively grabbed Jin Yang’s muscular arm, but the two of them lost their balance and fell onto the bed.\nJin Yang supported himself with both hands on the soft mattress, enclosing Qiu Tong between his arms. Water droplets trickled down his hair and landed on Qiu Tong’s neck. The water droplets were cool, but at this moment, they felt especially hot to Qiu Tong. She felt her entire body heat up uncontrollably and she twisted her body uneasily.\nQiu Tong’s bent legs accidentally rubbed against Jin Yang’s lower abdomen, causing the towel to move a few inches downwards.\n“Are you all right?”\nJin Yang’s Adam’s apple bobbed. His eyes darkened as he tried his best to suppress the surging desire in his heart.\nQiu Tong shook her head and wanted to get up from the bed, but her hands accidentally brushed against Jin Yang’s exposed abdomen. She panicked and jerked her hands away, only to end up touching the area below his abdomen.\nJin Yang furrowed his brows as he gave a suppressed grunt.\nFeeling suffocated, Qiu Tong hurriedly let go. She pushed Jin Yang away and ran out of the door in panic and embarrassment, her footsteps disappearing at the end of the corridor.\nJin Yang sat by the bed and took deep breaths to calm himself. He lowered his head to look at himself. He had no choice but to return to the bathroom and take a cold shower to vent his amorous desires.\n…\nIn the middle of the night, Lu Zhiling was about to close the clinic and leave when two masked men barged in.\nLooking at the men who looked like fugitives, Lu Zhiling was so frightened that she hugged her head and squatted on the ground. She raised her hand and pointed at the cashier. “Don’t kill me!”\n“I’ll give you whatever you want…”\nThe two men pointed their guns at Lu Zhiling. They looked at each other and said, “Bring out all the special medicine that can treat liver cancer!”\nLu Zhiling looked up in surprise and explained, “Liver cancer is an irreversible disease. Medicine can only alleviate it. There’s no special medicine…”\nWhen the masked man heard her words, he was so angry that he smashed the clinic. The burly man stepped on the signboard outside the door and broke it.\n“Didn’t your sign outside say that you can cure all diseases?”\nLu Zhiling did not expect that her bragging would cause trouble for her. In her panic, she thought of Qiu Tong and hurriedly tried to divert this danger onto her. “You can look for Qiu Tong.. Her medical skills are better than mine. She might have a solution!”",

Dina and Yu Ge’s faces were reflected in the mirror!\nDina pulled out two chairs and sat on them. He took out a pill and swallowed it.\nDina had been diagnosed with liver cancer while he was serving time in prison. However, the medical facilities in prison were extremely poor, and there was no way to treat him.\nDina took advantage of the prison riot to escape, wanting to find a chance to save his own life!\nYu Ge was a good sweet-talker. In the prison, he could tell that Dina was very capable, so he took the initiative to help him get food and even massaged his legs.\nDina treated him as his lackey, which was why he was part of the escape plan.\nThe two of them escaped from the prison. Apart from avoiding the police and the prison guards, they also searched all over for famous clinics.\nThey were trying to find some reputable clinic and doctor who could treat Dina’s liver cancer, but Yu Ge did not expect this to lead to Qiu Tong.\nYu Ge remembered that it was all thanks to Qiu Tong that he was sent to suffer in prison.\nHe gritted his teeth, wanting to take the opportunity to settle the score with Qiu Tong.\nYu Ge looked at Dina’s pained expression and suggested, “Elder Brother, I can send a message on the Dark Web.”\n“I have some familiar contacts who can think of a way to get Qiu Tong to treat you.”\n“But… after Qiu Tong treats your illness, you have to promise me that you’ll hand her over to me to deal with! There’s a grudge between us.”\nYu Ge’s eyes flickered with anger and vengeance. Dina narrowed his eyes and thought for a while before nodding in agreement.\n“I’ll do as you say. As long as I can be cured, I’ll help you with anything!”\nAfter Dina made his promise, Yu Ge happily found a computer to go onto the Dark Web.\n…\nIn the guest room of the villa, Jin Yang took a cold shower and returned to the bed. He saw his phone screen light up before fading.\nHe scooped up a towel and dried his wet hair, but paused when he saw the missed call.\nJin Yang was a little hesitant and wanted to pretend not to see it when Song Yan called again. He quietly accepted the call…\nSong Yan asked sarcastically, “I didn’t expect the president to be someone who would back on his word?”\n“You promised me yesterday that you would keep a distance from Qiu Tong and never appear in front of her and the children. What are you doing now?”\nSong Yan seemed to be secretly observing his actions. Jin Yang frowned in displeasure, but he could not think of any excuse or explanation. He could only purse his thin lips into a straight line as he gripped his phone tightly. He walked to the window of the guest room and pulled open the curtain to reveal his figure.\nSong Yan sneered and said, “Think of a way to leave now. Don’t let Qiu Tong and the children find out.”\n“If I find out that you secretly appeared in front of them again, I will expose the fact that you have been deceiving them!”\nWhen Jin Yang heard Song Yan’s threat, he frowned solemnly and asked coldly, “What are you planning to do?”\n“None of your business. I’ll give you five minutes to leave the villa!”\nSong Yan hung up after saying that. Jin Yang listened to the beeping tone and had no choice but to comply.",

      "content": "Chapter 181: Shower Scent\nEarly in the morning, Qiu Tong came out of the bedroom in her pajamas. She stretched and looked at the guest room, feeling a little awkward as she recalled everything that had happened last night.\nClick. The door next door opened.\nQiu Tong was a little flustered and wanted to turn around to dodge, but she heard two soft chuckles from behind. “Good morning.”\nSong Yan rubbed his messy hair. He deliberately yawned and walked to Qiu Tong’s side, greeting her in a hoarse and magnetic voice.\nQiu Tong pursed her red lips. From the corner of her eye, she saw Song Yan lean over. Her face flushed red as she said in a muffled voice, “Good morning.”\nSong Yan narrowed his long and narrow eyes. He deliberately reached out to remove a fallen eyelash from Qiu Tong’s face.\nThe temperature of his fingertips was a little cold. Qiu Tong instinctively lowered her eyes but did not move away. Their posture was slightly intimate and suggestive.\nA cool breeze blew over from outside the villa. Qiu Tong suddenly smelled a special shower gel scent on Song Yan—it was not the lemon fragrance from last night.\nBack when Qiu Tong was stocking up on daily necessities, she had bought a few boxes of lemon-flavored shower gel and kept them at home as a backup.\nLast night, Jin Yang had used that shower gel before he came out of the bathroom. Qiu Tong definitely remembered that familiar smell.\nQiu Tong frowned in confusion. She pulled the front of Song Yan’s shirt toward her to smell, muttering to herself. “Didn’t you use the lemon-scented shower gel yesterday? Did you prepare other toiletries for yourself?”\nJin Yang’s overnight stay had been an unexpected situation. How could he have prepared other toiletries?\nSong Yan suddenly realized that Qiu Tong seemed to have noticed some suspicious discrepancies between him and Jin Yang. He cursed Jin Yang in his heart for causing trouble for him!\n“The children are watching. Isn’t it improper for us to be like this?”\nSong Yan leaned back and held Qiu Tong’s wrist to control her movements. He tilted his head and reminded her with a teasing smile.\nQiu Tong was stunned for a moment. She turned around and saw that Qiu Xingyuan, Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu had come out of their rooms at some point and were staring at the two of them quietly.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao pursed their lips. Their expressions were indescribably conflicted, causing Qiu Tong to feel a little guilty.\nQiu Xingyu’s eyes shone with excitement. She hurriedly covered her eyes and muttered, “Mommy, don’t worry about us!”\n“We didn’t see anything. We won’t peek either!”\n“You can continue with Uncle Song Yan…”\nQiu Xingyu’s childish words embarrassed Qiu Tong. She shook off Song Yan’s hand and asked with a frown, “When did they appear? Why didn’t you tell me?”\nSong Yan shrugged slightly and leaned against the wall. He pretended to be innocent and said, “You didn’t give me a chance.”\nHe quietly pointed at his shirt, which Qiu Tong had pulled into disarray, a mischievous glint in his eyes.\nQiu Tong looked away as she said, “Quickly tidy your shirt.”\nSong Yan asked, “You wanted to smell my scent just now? Why don’t you continue?”\nHe deliberately spread his arms, confident that Qiu Tong would not dare to carry out such an intimate act in front of the children. His tone was teasing.\nQiu Xingyu had covered her eyes with her hands, but when Qiu Tong wasn’t paying attention, she peeped at Song Yan and Qiu Tong through the gaps between her fingers.\nQiu Xingyuan was so angry that his face turned red. He and Qiu Xingqiao rushed over to Qiu Xingyu and covered her eyes tightly.\nLittle Yu pouted in annoyance. She wanted to push away her brothers’ hands, but she did not have enough strength. She could only stamp her feet to express her frustration.\n“Why is it that only my brothers can watch? I’m not a child and I want to see Mommy too…”",

Song Yan’s attitude was a little distant, but he reluctantly played with her for a while to humor her. He then told a convenient lie and found an excuse to leave the villa.\nQiu Tong was tidying the utensils in the kitchen. She looked at the bubbles in the sink and recalled the two strange events that had happened in succession. She felt that something was amiss.\nThere were times when Song Yan’s behavior and attitude changed. Qiu Tong narrowed her eyes and recalled the information she had previously gathered.\n“Are they not the same person?”\nQiu Tong frowned and turned off the tap. She wiped her foamy hands and took out her phone to search for news about the capital’s official residence.\nSong Yan and Jin Yang were twins. They looked so similar that ordinary people could not tell the difference.\nQiu Tong’s suspicions intensified. “Could he be Jin Yang?”\nThe screen of her phone lit up. Qiu Tong tilted her head and looked at the news released by the government’s official website regarding the various disasters. She read out a few lines. “The president is extremely concerned about the situation of the people suffering from disasters everywhere. He will hold a special video conference with the officials in the official residence to discuss how to reduce the losses of the peopleâ€¦”\nDid this news mean that Jin Yang had never left the official residence of the capital?\nQiu Tong looked out the window at the white clouds. She shook her head, wanting to shake off the ridiculous and complicated thoughts. She once again dispelled her suspicions about her identity.\n...\nIn the official residence of the capital, Shao An had been busy for several nights without even time for sleep. He dispatched Jin Yang’s instructions batch by batch.\n“When will the president return?”\nShao An scratched his head. He had been so anxious recently that his body was nearly glowing red. He said, “Not just anyone can do the president’s job!”\nHe had only been helping to cover for Jin Yang over the past few days, but Shao An was already exhausted with dark eye circles.\nIn S City, Qiu Tong recalled the prison riot and became increasingly worried about Qiu Rong’s safety.\nShe remembered that the warden had once mentioned that she could pay money to reduce Qiu Rong’s sentence. Qiu Tong took out a bank card and a few checks from her drawer. After calculating her current savings, she muttered with a worried expression, “I still have to earn more money.”\nThe children and Qiu Rong needed money. Qiu Tong went to the study and logged on to the Dark Web via the computer, wanting to see if there were any suitable missions to take on.\nQiu Tong filtered the missions according to her own situation and quickly found an employer who claimed to be a government official looking for a skilled fighter.\n“What are the specific requirements for the mission?”\nQiu Tong tapped lightly on the keyboard, but the other party did not answer her directly. Instead, he asked her a few basic questions.\nA few lines of text appeared in the chat box. “We want to capture a criminal alive.”\n“If you can do it, the remuneration will definitely satisfy you.”\nThe other party confirmed that Qiu Tong’s ability was sufficient for the mission before giving her a contact number and then immediately exited the Dark Web.\nQiu Tong noted down the number with raised eyebrows. “He’s quite cautious.”\nShe dialed the number and after the call went through, the other party said bluntly, “The person you need to capture is called Qiu Tong.”\n“She lives in a wealthy villa district. It’s best if you can capture her within two days. Remember not to let her dieâ€¦”\nQiu Tong looked at her own face in the mirror and smiled in surprise and amusement.\nThis mission was a godsend!",

      "content": "Chapter 183: Failed Tracking\nQiu Tong could tell that the person on the phone was Yu Ge, who had escaped from the prison. She deliberately stalled for time asking, “Since you have a grudge against the person, why do you capture her alive?”\nYu Ge could not be bothered to explain. He just perfunctorily discussed the remuneration after the matter was settled.\nQiu Tong tapped on the computer and started to track the real-time location of the call. She said in a mocking tone, “You just escaped from prison, how could you have so much money? You probably want to trick me into capturing the mark and then cheat me, right?”\n“Yu Ge, if you want to capture me, why don’t you just find me directly? Why waste so much time?”\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes as she stared at the red dot on the computer screen. She smiled as she headed out to Yu Ge’s location.\nYu Ge finally recognized Qiu Tong’s voice. He was so frightened that cold sweat broke out on his back. “Wh… What are you talking about? Who is Yu Ge?”\nQiu Tong stopped a taxi and directed the driver to drive to the specified location. She smirked and asked, “You don’t even dare to admit your own name?”\n“Yet you have the guts to hire people to capture me?”\n“I advise you to prepare the remuneration. I am coming to see you now! If you have anything to say, let’s talk face to face!”\nYu Ge swallowed hard. He stared suspiciously at the traffic around him. He was so frightened that he hung up the phone and threw it away before fleeing.\nQiu Tong was just one step too late when she arrived at the location. She searched for Yu Ge using the location of the phone but found the device floating in the river. “You fled quite fast.”\nYu Ge ran back to his temporary residence in a panic. Dina looked at him impatiently. “Have you captured her yet?”\n“No, I didn’t expect to encounter Qiu Tong on the Dark Web. She has already discovered that we want to capture her. She’ll definitely be on her guard.”\nYu Ge sensed Dina’s anger and hurriedly handed him two cigarettes. “Don’t worry, give me a few more days…”\nDina waved his hand and kicked Yu Ge away. He raised his leg and stepped on Yu Ge’s chest. Dina whispered fiercely, “I don’t have time!”\n“You better bring Qiu Tong over quickly. Otherwise, your life will be in danger!”\n“I will make sure you die before me!”\nYu Ge was dizzy from his beating and thought that he would die then and there. However, Dina suddenly coughed twice.\nHe covered his mouth as he stepped on Yu Ge. He felt an intense pain in his lungs. Dina’s breath seemed to carry the smell of blood.\nYu Ge did not dare to cry out in pain and could only find an excuse to explain. “Qiu Tong immediately recognized my voice. I didn’t expect her to be so smart. I let her escape because I was unprepared.”\n“But Boss, don’t worry. We can still target her children!”\n“Qiu Tong cares a lot about her children. As long as we can find a way to capture the children and threaten her, she will definitely compromise and work for us to develop a medicine that can cure you.”\nYu Ge suggested with a sincere and pleading look. Dina finally relaxed and let Yu Ge get up. “I’ll trust you one last time.”\nDina took out his phone and contacted his other subordinates using the secret code of the organization. He pointed at Yu Ge and said, “Come here. What do Qiu Tong’s children look like? Where are their usual haunts? Tell them clearly.”\nYu Ge rubbed his neck with his hands. He promptly described Qiu Xingyuan, Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu…\nDina sat on the bench and looked at the bottle in front of him. There were only two or three pills left. He rubbed his thumb with a dark expression. “I don’t have much time left.”",

      "content": "Chapter 184: Baited By A Car Accident\nAfter the riot in the neighboring city was resolved, S City returned to its usual peace and the kindergarten opened as usual.\nThe Qiu siblings waved goodbye to the teacher and stood obediently under the sycamore tree, waiting for Qiu Tong to bring them home.\nYu Ge and his subordinates from the terrorist organization hid in the dark and watched for an opportunity. They realized that there were not many parents around and started circling the three children, wanting to kidnap them. However, Qiu Tong arrived just then. Seeing that the situation was not right, she shouted, “Come quickly!”\nQiu Xingyuan grabbed Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu and ran to Qiu Tong’s back. When the burly men saw that Qiu Tong was a woman, they wanted to attack her.\nQiu Tong used her arms to block their punches. She bent her legs and kicked the burly man closest to her.\nThump!\nQiu Tong stepped on his shoulder and accurately kicked the head of another man behind. The impact was so strong that both of them fell to the ground.\n“Retreat!”\nYu Ge did not expect Qiu Tong to be so skilled in combat. He hurriedly fled, afraid that Qiu Tong would see him.\nThe terrorist organization’s subordinates carried their injured brothers and fled in a sorry state. Qiu Tong touched the children’s heads and asked if they were injured.\nThey wanted to kidnap the children?\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes as she looked at the corner of the street where the burly men had disappeared. She frowned as she considered finding Yu Ge’s whereabouts and sending him back to prison.\nMeanwhile, Dina looked at Yu Ge, who had returned empty-handed. He asked unhappily, “How much time do you want to waste?”\nYu Ge explained with a trembling voice, “Boss, we have no choice but to think of a way to bypass Qiu Tong and trick the children into coming with us!”\n“I have an idea. We will definitely succeed this time…”\nYu Ge squatted beside Dina like a lackey and quietly explained his plan.\nDina pinched the space between his eyebrows and said tiredly, “I’ll give you one last chance. If you can’t capture Qiu Tong, I’ll throw you into the river to feed the fish!” Yu Ge’s pupils trembled violently as he hurriedly nodded and promised.\nThe next afternoon, Qiu Tong sent the children to kindergarten. She wanted to do some simple cleaning in the villa and sat in the living room humming a song.\nHowever, her personal phone began to vibrate and ring incessantly. Every time Qiu Tong answered the call, she could hear a murmuring coming from the other end, accompanied by a few words that she did not understand. “Hello?”\nIn just half an hour, Qiu Tong had received dozens of calls. Her patience was running out, so she switched off her phone to have some peace.\nMeanwhile, in the kindergarten, Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao were sitting with Little Yu and watching a cartoon on the screen. The plot was getting intense and Little Yu was sweating profusely for the cartoon’s protagonist.\nThe next second, the screen switched to the emergency news channel.\nThe three children looked up at the screen in surprise. The news reported that there was a serious car accident in S City. The current condition of the injured person was extremely unstable and she could die anytime. The ambulance had already sent her to the hospital for treatment.\n“Eldest Brother… doesn’t Mommy have clothes that look like that?”\nQiu Xingyu stared at the screen and saw the paramedics carrying a stretcher. Although she could not see the injured person’s face, her clothes were familiar to the children…\nQiu Xingqiao instinctively retorted. “Many people in S City have such clothes.”\nQiu Xingyuan pursed his thin lips. With a serious and nervous expression, he looked at the area where the car had met with the accident. It was along the route between the villa district and their kindergarten. “Don’t panic, let’s go find the teacher!”",

      "content": "Chapter 185: Tricked Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios\nQiu Xingyuan found the teacher and tried his best to describe the situation. \"Teacher, can you help us call Mommy?\"\nThe kindergarten teacher suddenly became nervous. She called Qiu Tong on the spot only to hear the cold automated female voice on the other end. \"The number you have dialed is unavailable. Please try again later.\" Qiu Xingyu stamped her feet anxiously. Her eyes were filled with tears as she tugged at Qiu Xingyuan's hand. \"Eldest Brother, what should we do?\"\nQiu Xingyuan's heart sank. He turned around and looked at the news footage. \"The victim has been sent to Guang Ming Hospital for treatment.\"\n\"Let's go to the hospital to find Mommy!\"\nQiu Xingqiao wanted to run out on impulse, but the kindergarten teacher blocked them. \"Children, it's too dangerous for you to go out now. I will think of a way to contact your mother. After we understand the situation, I will bring you to the hospital, okay?\"\nThe kindergarten teacher was afraid that Qiu Xingyuan and the rest would secretly run out, so she left them in a room and closed the door from the outside.\nQiu Xingyu pursed her lips and looked at the news with a sobbing voice. \"Eldest Brother, what should we do?\"\n\"If it is really Mommy in the car accident, we have to go to the hospital quickly!\"\nQiu Xingyuan took a deep breath and tried his best to placate his younger siblings. \"Let's wait for teacheraCr\nOutside the kindergarten, the teachers continued to try calling Qiu Tong but to no avail.\nThey wanted to contact Qiu Tong using the contact details in the school register, which Qiu Tong had provided when the children first enrolled as students. But they realized that the Qiu family had already moved from that address.\nThe kindergarten teacher whispered nervously, \"Could it really be their mother?\" \"Should we send the children to the hospital?\"\nHowever, according to the rules, they could not leave the kindergarten without permission. The teachers had no choice but to contact the hospital to inquire about the situation.\nFive minutes later, the reporters had rushed to the hospital for a follow-up report.\nThe children looked at the doctors and nurses walking in and out of the room. Their expressions were especially serious. Under the questioning of the reporters, they hurriedly answered, \"The patient's injuries are very serious now. Her condition is at a very critical stage.\"\n\"I hope the family of the patient will rush to the hospital to sign the paperwork if they see the news.\"\nWhen Qiu Xingyuan heard this, his face instantly turned pale. His hands were tightly clenched into fists, and he could not sit still.\nQiu Xingyuan looked at the glass window of the room and said in a tense voice, \"Let's open the window and run out from there!\"\nQiu Xingqiao immediately moved a stool over. He was the first to step on the stool and climb to the window. He expertly leaped out and landed safely, before turning around and spreading his arms wide to catch Qiu Xingyuan.\nLittle Yu nervously climbed up to the window. She looked at the height and felt a little dizzy.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao comforted her. \"Little Yu, close your eyes and jump down. We will catch you!\"\nQiu Xingyu was so nervous that she took a deep breath. Thinking that Qiu Tong might be critically ill, she propped herself up against the window and gritted her teeth as she jumped down.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao caught her firmly in their arms. The three children fell to the ground due to the impact. Ignoring the abrasions and pain on their arms, they dusted off the dirt and stood up, before rushing to the hospital.\nAt Guang Ming Hospital, the children found the floor where the emergency room was.\nThey followed the directions of the man who looked like a doctor and came to a certain ward. The door was locked. Qiu Xingyuan saw the tattoos on the arms of the men in the room and immediately understood that it was all a trap.\nThey had been tricked!",

      "content": "Chapter 186: Failure To Fetch The Children\nQiu Xingyuan realized that something was wrong. He and Qiu Xingqiao exchanged looks and wanted to break out of the trap, but the three children were too weak.\nThe burly men from the terrorist organization grabbed the children and tied them to the chairs. “You better stay here obediently and wait for your mother to save you. We won’t hurt anyone, but if you play any tricks, these knives in our hands…”\n“Hehe.”\nThe burly men swivelled the foldable knives in their hands. Qiu Xingyu dodged in fear. Qiu Xingyuan shouted. “Don’t touch our sister!”\n…\nIn the kindergarten, Qiu Tong waited outside for a long time but did not see Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao come out. She found a teacher and asked about the situation.\nThe teachers heaved a sigh of relief when they saw Qiu Tong. They shook her hand excitedly and said, “I’m so glad you’re alright!”\nQiu Tong looked at them in confusion and asked, “What’s wrong?”\nTheir eyes met and the teachers were stunned for a moment before pulling up the news footage of the accident. They handed their phones to Qiu Tong for her to see. “We and the children all thought that you had an accident. They were so anxious to go to the hospital to see you.”\n“We wanted to call you but couldn’t reach you. Your phone is switched off!”\nOne of the kindergarten teachers took out the school register. “If it’s convenient, can you update your address?”\n“If not for the fact that your address wasn’t updated, we would have gone to your house to ask about the situation!”\nQiu Tong was in no mood to listen to the teachers. She just kept looking at the news footage on the screen, feeling that something was wrong.\n“Where are the children? Can you bring me to them?”\nQiu Tong frowned as she spoke. The teachers hurriedly brought her to the room where the children were kept. “We were so anxious and the children were very worried about you. Little Yu was so anxious that she was about to cry…”\n“Your relationship is so good. I can tell that the children rely on you very much.”\nQiu Tong felt increasingly uneasy when she heard these words.\nThe kindergarten teachers opened the door and called out. “Children, your mother is here to bring you home…”\nThere was no response from anyone in the room. All the toys were scattered on the ground, looking especially messy.\nThe window of the recording studio was wide open and a few stools were piled up by the window. Where were the children?\nQiu Tong could tell at one glance that Qiu Xingyuan and the others had used the stools to escape. She could not help frowning.\nThe teachers looked back at Qiu Tong in a panic. Afraid of being held responsible, they explained, “We did leave Qiu Xingyuan and his younger siblings here because we were afraid that they would sneak out, but we didn’t expect…”\nThey were afraid that Qiu Tong would blame them, but Qiu Tong refused to listen.\nQiu Tong thought of the Yu Ge incident a few days ago and felt increasingly uneasy.\n“Can I trouble you to show me the news footage again?”\nQiu Tong carefully analyzed every frame. When she saw the signboard of Guang Ming Hospital, she rushed off to the hospital without another word.\nNothing must happen to the children!\nQiu Tong could feel her palms sweating. She ran out of the kindergarten and met the mercenaries and Ye Luan, who were heading home from school.\n“Boss? Where are you going?”\nKe Le had never seen such a flustered expression on Qiu Tong’s face before.",

      "content": "Chapter 187: Trade\n“The children might be in danger. I need to rush to the hospital to save them.”\nQiu Tong explained the situation anxiously. Ye Luan’s expression instantly turned serious and anxious as he said, “I want to go with you.”\nIt was very likely that Yu Ge and the others had set up an ambush at the hospital. Qiu Tong pretended to be calm and pressed the top of Ye Luan’s head. “No.”\n“I can’t be sure how many of them there are. They have Qiu Xingyuan, Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu.”\n“If I bring you to the hospital, I would be too preoccupied to protect you. Just stay at home and wait for news…”\nQiu Tong said in a hoarse voice. Ye Luan retorted seriously, “Their target is you, so they won’t be too guarded against me.”\n“Uncle Ke Le and the rest can help you too. We will definitely not be burdens!”\nQiu Tong could see Ye Luan’s stubbornness and persistence. In the end, she compromised and agreed to bring the mercenaries along with her, while Ye Luan had to return home to wait for news.\nYe Luan looked at their departing back profiles. He seemed to have come up with some idea before running off in the other direction.\n…\nOutside the hospital ward, Qiu Tong saw Yu Ge sitting there with a few burly men. She narrowed her eyes and said, “It’s really you.”\nYu Ge swept his gaze across Ke Le and the rest. Taking advantage of the fact that he had the subordinates of the terrorist organization behind him, he said in a forceful and commanding tone, “If you want to save your children, come in yourself. Don’t let these people come near the ward. Otherwise, I can’t guarantee that your children…”\n“Will be able to leave in one piece!”\nSeeing Yu Ge’s arrogant manner, Ke Le immediately wanted to take out the pistol at his waist, but Qiu Tong quickly stopped him. “Don’t be impulsive.”\nQiu Tong quietly surveyed the surroundings. She could tell that Yu Ge had everything under control. He would not have been able to do all this on his own.\nThere must be someone backing Yu Ge…\nQiu Tong tried her best to suppress her emotions as she probed, “I’m the one you want to capture. Since I’m here, you can ask for anything. I’ll definitely do it, but you have to guarantee my children’s safety.”\n“I’ll go by myself. Let go of the children!”\nKe Le heard Qiu Tong’s compromise and said anxiously, “This won’t do!”\nAs a mercenary, Ke Le had a keen sense of danger. He could sense that the other party was no pushover and was extremely hostile towards Qiu Tong.\n“I have to go in with you…”\nQiu Tong could tell that Ke Le was worried about her. She tried her best to squeeze out a smile and whispered, “When the children come out later, protect them well. Leave the rest to me. Don’t worry, I know my limits!”\nYu Ge’s eyes were filled with arrogance and evil intent. Qiu Tong knew that things would not end well today.\nQiu Tong took the initiative to put down the weapon she was carrying. She raised her hands and slowly approached Yu Ge. “Are you satisfied now?”\nYu Ge shook his head. He pointed at the mercenaries who were still surrounding them warily and said, “Let them leave.”\nQiu Tong turned around and shot Ke Le a meaningful glance but he remained stubbornly in place. Afraid of angering Yu Ge so much that he would hurt the children, Qiu Tong had no choice but to command. “This is an order!”\nIt seemed like she would have to suffer a little today before she could leave Yu Ge’s hands.\nQiu Tong stared fixedly at Yu Ge, secretly thinking of a way to escape.",

He leaned over and patted her face. “Are you obedient now?”\nYu Ge picked up the water bottle and poured all the water over Qiu Tong’s head. Water dripped down her hair.\nQiu Tong frowned but remained silent. Yu Ge saw her expression and had the urge to torture her. He tugged at Qiu Tong’s hair. “You are the one who forced me to this extent. I don’t want to torture you either, but how long was I in prison because of you?”\n“Do you know what it’s like in prison?”\nYu Ge licked his lips and tugged at Qiu Tong’s hair, forcing her to look at him. “Don’t worry, I’ll let you feel it!”\nArriving at the front of the government building, Ye Luan immediately went forward and tugged at the security guard. “I want to see Mayor Shen!”\n“I’m from Qiu Tong’s family. Tell Mayor Shen… he’ll definitely see me!”\nYe Luan was smart. After he parted ways with Qiu Tong, he had thought of asking Song Yan for help. However, he did not have Song Yan’s contact details, so he could only look for Mayor Shen.\nThe security guard saw that Ye Luan was just a child and wanted to ignore him. However, he remembered that Qiu Tong was the hero who developed the locust pesticide and had some connection to Mayor Shen. He informed Mayor Shen who immediately came out. When Ye Luan saw him, he blurted out anxiously. “Something has happened to Qiu Tong!”\n“Can you contact Song Yan and ask him to save Auntie Qiu?”\nMayor Shen was a little surprised. He frowned and thought that Ye Luan should be talking about Mr. Jin Yang. He might have mixed up the two of them.\nMayor Shen immediately inquired about the situation in detail. “Don’t worry, I’ll tell him about it.”\nYe Luan nodded vigorously, his expression as intense as a young adult’s. “You have to do it quickly! I’m worried that the situation at the hospital will be very dangerous. No matter how powerful Auntie Qiu is, she will still need external reinforcements.”\nMayor Shen immediately contacted Jin Yang, while Ye Luan turned around and rushed to the hospital to meet Ke Le and the rest.\nOutside the hospital, Yu Ge did keep his promise. He arranged for the terrorists to bring the children out.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao’s hands were tied with ropes. When Ke Le saw that they did not seem to be injured, his anxious heart finally relaxed a little. There was some dirt on Little Yu’s face. She was so frightened that she appeared to be in a daze.\nQiu Xingqiao turned around and glared at the terrorist organization members. “Where’s our mommy?”\nThe terrorist laughed hoarsely and said, “She traded herself in order to save you!”\n“You brats are a hindrance to us. Leave now! Don’t interfere with our business… get lost!”\nThe terrorists were already tired of the children and felt that they were burdens. They threw the children onto the road outside the hospital.\nKe Le and Ye Luan rushed over from the other side of the road, wanting to help them untie the ropes.\nHowever, when Qiu Xingyuan heard that Qiu Tong was still imprisoned in the hospital, he turned around and wanted to rush back to save her. In Ke Le rushed forward to stop him, but the terrorists misunderstood his actions and thought that the mercenaries were trying to start a fight.\n“Don’t move!”\nThe terrorists took out their guns and pulled the triggers ruthlessly. The passersby were so frightened that they dodged and ducked. The scene instantly turned chaotic.\nKe Le hugged Qiu Xingyu but saw that Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao had been re-captured by the terrorists.",

      "content": "Chapter 189: The Children Save Each Other\nOne of the terrorists held Qiu Xingyuan and swung his hand, wanting to hit him. However, Qiu Xingqiao wrapped himself around his leg and bit him.\nThe burly terrorist kicked Qiu Xingqiao away in pain. Taking advantage of the distraction, Qiu Xingyuan used his fingers to poke the terrorist’s eyes. While the man was covering his eyes and wailing, Qiu Xingyuan wanted to continue running towards the hospital. However, the other terrorists rushed over to support their comrade. They spread their arms wide to capture the two children.\nYe Luan saw that the situation was critical. The image of Qiu Tong and the children taking care of him flashed across his mind… he acted on instinct.\nAlthough Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao always seemed to be full of hostility towards him, they would secretly prepare breakfast for Ye Luan. They would even wait for him on the way home from school and awkwardly get him to stay on whenever they saw that Ye Luan wanted to leave!\nThese memories made Ye Luan lower his head and take out the human modification medicine he had been carrying with him.\nHe did not know if there would be any side effects after injecting this into his body, but Ye Luan didn’t care now!\nHe looked at Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao, who were about to be captured by the terrorists. He gritted his teeth and inserted the syringe into his abdomen. The moment the medicine surged into his body, Ye Luan’s physical statistics improved substantially.\nYe Luan ran into the enemy’s side at an extremely fast speed. He pulled away the burly man holding Qiu Xingyuan and shouted, “We’ll run from the left!”\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao looked at each other and immediately ran to Ye Luan’s side to meet up with him.\nThe terrorists did not expect another brat to appear from nowhere. They were rather bewildered as they picked up their guns. “We didn’t want to hurt you, but you kids seem to have a death wish! Don’t blame us…”\nSeeing that he was about to pull the trigger, Ye Luan picked up a brick on the ground and threw it at him.\nThe brick landed accurately on his head. Two drops of blood trickled down the burly man’s forehead. He wiped it with his hand, his eyes filled with frustration and impatience as he growled, “These children are so troublesome!”\nQiu Xingqiao did not expect Ye Luan to be so brave and fierce. He raised his slingshot and picked up a handful of stones, continuously attacking those who tried to get close.\nQiu Xingyuan turned around and looked in the direction where Ke Le and the others had come to reinforce them. Without the need to say anything, the three children slowly retreated in unison toward Ke Le, gradually leaving the terrorists’ encirclement.\nYe Luan handed Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao over to Ke Le. He arranged for them to hide in a secluded corner of the street before turning around, wanting to take advantage of the chaos to enter the hospital.\nQiu Xingyuan grabbed his hand. “Let’s go together!”\nYe Luan shook his head and pulled his fingers away. “You have to take care of Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu. I’ll go find Auntie Qiu.”\nQiu Xingyuan looked at the frightened Little Yu, whose eyes revealed her fear. He pursed his thin lips and looked at Ye Luan. Finally, he frowned and said softly, “You must be careful. Don’t be injured… they are very powerful.”\nYe Luan smiled and nodded. “Alright.”\nMeanwhile, Jin Yang was in the prison investigating where Dina and the others might have fled. He received a call from Mayor Shen.\nMayor Shen said anxiously, “Mr. President, the escaped criminal Yu Ge seems to be at Guang Ming Hospital. He used the children as bait to lure Qiu Tong over. The situation is uncertain now. One of the Qiu family kids came to seek help…”\n“I’ve already arranged for some police officers to rush over. What do you think…”\nBefore Mayor Shen could finish speaking, Jin Yang stood up from his chair with a serious expression. He shot a look at his guard before instructing the warden, “Give me some guns! Hurry!”\nFive minutes later, Jin Yang rushed to the hospital with his entire team. Along the way, his expression was exceptionally grim. He secretly gritted his teeth as he thought about Qiu Tong’s safety.",

She pretended to be defenseless as she accepted Yu Ge’s torment, letting him relax his guard.\nYu Ge bent over and leaned closer. He raised Qiu Tong’s chin with his finger and said with interest, “You haven’t been touched by a man for a long time, right? Why don’t I help you? You look like you need a man to nourish you!”\nYu Ge’s words were disgusting to hear. He tugged at his own belt.\nQiu Tong quietly loosened the hemp rope around her wrists, preparing to subdue Yu Ge at any moment.\nYu Ge walked over to Qiu Tong’s side. Just as he was about to pull her clothes apart, the door of the ward slammed open and Jin Yang barged in with a team. He saw Qiu Tong’s shocked expression and Yu Ge’s hand on his pants. His eyes were filled with raging anger.\nThe president’s guards restrained all the terrorists in the ward, while Jin Yang strode over to Yu Ge.\nJin Yang grabbed Yu Ge’s head and slammed it onto the table. Bang! Bang! Bang! An especially muffled sound echoed in the room. Yu Ge felt blood gush down his eyes and his body went limp as he fell to the ground.\nQiu Tong’s heart stirred at Jin Yang’s violent behavior. She opened her mouth but didn’t know what to say.\nJin Yang seemed to have sensed her gaze. He turned around and gently untied the rope around her. “Are you alright?”\nHeart aching, he frowned when he saw the red marks on Qiu Tong’s wrists and other injuries.\nQiu Tong shook her head. Her clothes clung tightly to her skin, accentuating her graceful figure.\nJin Yang took off his jacket and gently covered her shoulders. A comforting fragrance lingered at the tip of Qiu Tong’s nose. She looked at the figure in front of her and felt an unprecedented warmth.\nJin Yang turned to look at Yu Ge, wishing he could just kill him!\nHowever, as the president, Jin Yang had to follow the law and not punish anyone in private. He could only clench his fists and control his emotions.\n“Cough cough…”\nYu Ge supported himself up weakly from the floor. He wiped the blood off his face. “Don’t think you can save Qiu Tong. My boss wants her…”\nYu Ge wanted to threaten the other party, but when he saw Qiu Tong and Jin Yang standing side by side, he was stunned.\nThe president?!\nSuch a small matter garnered the attention of the president?!\nCould it be that Qiu Tong’s luck was so good that the president happened to be nearby?\nYu Ge could not figure it out, but he knew that the president would never let civilians get hurt. From the corner of his eye, he saw a scalpel on the table in the ward.\n“Guards, detain him…”\nJin Yang instructed as he pointed at Yu Ge, not expecting Yu Ge to charge toward Qiu Tong with all his might.\nQiu Tong saw Yu Ge’s actions and wanted to dodge, but unexpectedly, Jin Yang enveloped her in his arms and used his back to block the attack. The president’s guards immediately rushed over from all sides to protect Jin Yang, while Yu Ge took the opportunity to throw the scalpel to the ground. He turned and ran towards the door, taking advantage of the chaos to escape.\n“Are you all right?”\nStill in Jin Yang’s arms, Qiu Tong looked up and met his dark eyes. She could feel his gentleness and concern. Her heart trembled.",

      "content": "Chapter 191: An Affectionate Kiss\nThe president’s guards escorted the rest of the terrorists out of the hospital so that it would be easier to interrogate them.\nJin Yang looked at the bruises on Qiu Tong’s neck and recalled Yu Ge’s actions. He felt a dull pain in his heart as if someone was squeezing it.\nHe did not dare to think too much. If he had been a step late, that bastard Yu Ge might have abused Qiu Tong and even…\nHuge waves of emotions surged in Jin Yang’s eyes. He grabbed Qiu Tong’s waist and pulled her into his arms.\nQiu Tong’s pupils dilated in surprise as Jin Yang’s warm hands held her waist. Their breathing quickened.\n“I’m fine. You don’t have to be so anxious.”\n“These are just superficial injuries. Yu Ge doesn’t want to kill me. He probably has other plans.”\nQiu Tong misunderstood that Jin Yang wanted to check on her injuries. She explained in a hoarse voice as she gently nudged Jin Yang’s shoulder.\nJin Yang narrowed his eyes. He could no longer control his emotions. Instead, he held Qiu Tong’s face with both hands and bent over to kiss her red lips. He bit Qiu Tong’s lower lip as if he was tasting a delicacy. He used the tip of his tongue to press against her teeth, making suggestive sounds when their lips met.\nQiu Tong’s legs went limp. Jin Yang held the back of her head, refusing to let her retreat as he grabbed her waist.\nQiu Tong’s scalp turned numb as she gradually leaned into him.\nYe Luan saw the president’s guards escorting the terrorists away. He ran into the ward anxiously and called out weakly, “Auntie Qiu?”\nQiu Tong was immersed in Jin Yang’s kiss and did not hear his voice. When Ye Luan saw that Qiu Tong was not injured, he heaved a sigh of relief.\nThat human modification medicine had exhausted all of Ye Luan’s energy. He swayed twice and fainted on the ground.\nThe equipment in the ward was knocked to the ground by Ye Luan and scattered all over the place.\nThe loud crashing sounds made Qiu Tong and Jin Yang separate. Qiu Tong pushed Jin Yang away anxiously and ran to Ye Luan’s side. Looking at Ye Luan’s pale face, she hurriedly covered Ye Luan’s palm with her hand and secretly used her supernatural power to treat Ye Luan.\nJin Yang helped Ye Luan up from the chair on the ground.\nThe moment their skin touched, they moved away awkwardly. An awkward atmosphere filled the air.\nQiu Tong raised her hand to wipe her swollen lips. She detected a faint lemon fragrance on Jin Yang, similar to the smell of the shower gel in the villa…\nYe Luan’s face was flushed red. Qiu Tong stared at the glass fragments scattered on the ground, watching Jin Yang’s actions through the reflection.\nShe was increasingly suspicious that she was seeing and interacting with two different people!\nYe Luan opened his eyes slowly. Qiu Tong heaved a sigh of relief. Ye Luan said in a weak voice, “Auntie Qiu, I’m so glad you’re alright.”\nQiu Tong was touched. She stroked the top of his head. “Lie here and rest.”\nYe Luan leaned against the wall obediently. Qiu Tong walked in front of Jin Yang and pointed at his injured hand. She said softly, “Let me treat your wound. I am better than the nurses in the hospital, you know that.”\nQiu Tong was probing. She stared intently at Jin Yang’s expression, not missing the slightest ripple in his eyes.",

      "content": "Chapter 192: Confirming That It Was Him\nJin Yang was stunned. Hearing Qiu Tong’s intimate tone, he pursed his lips and hid his tumultuous feelings.\nAt this moment, Jin Yang recalled Song Yan’s repeated warnings. He suddenly realized that he and Qiu Tong had already developed a frank and honest relationship.\nJin Yang shook his head lightly and pushed those thoughts away. He pretended to be calm and raised his hand, holding Qiu Tong’s palm in a familiar manner.\nQiu Tong looked at him with sparkling eyes. As she transferred her power into his body, she could confirm that the man in front of her was the same person she had met initially.\nNow, she only needed to find an opportunity to capture the other fellow who was pretending to be him!\nQiu Tong desperately wanted to know what was going on!\nHowever, she pretended to behave as per normal. Qiu Tong picked up the silver pistol that had fallen to the ground. She removed the magazine and filled it with bullets. “How did you find this place?” Yu Ge’s use of the children to threaten her had happened too suddenly. Qiu Tong did not even think of asking for help.\nJin Yang narrowed his eyes and retracted his arm. He lowered his eyes and rolled down his sleeves.\n“This child found Mayor Shen and asked him to contact me. He’s very smart and capable.”\nJin Yang looked at Ye Luan’s bruised face and praised him generously, “I can tell that he’s very concerned about you.”\nQiu Tong was touched. She didn’t expect Ye Luan to do all this.\nSuch a young child had run to the government building in such a short time. He must have suffered a lot in the process.\nQiu Tong’s heart ached. From the corner of her eye, she saw that Jin Yang’s neck was stained with the blood of terrorists. She wanted to take out a handkerchief to wipe it off for him…\n“Don’t move.”\nQiu Tong said in a low voice. Jin Yang looked at the woman in front of him and felt his heart skip a beat.\nHe stood stiffly on the spot, but instinctively bent over slightly to match Qiu Tong’s height.\nThe president’s guards had finished rounding up the terrorists. One of them returned to report when he saw the scene at the door. He coughed loudly.\nJin Yang raised his long and narrow eyes to glare at him, impatience and ruthlessness clear in them.\nThe president’s guard quickly straightened awkwardly and saluted. He guiltily shifted his gaze elsewhere. “Sir, according to their statements, there should be a few terrorists who took advantage of the chaos to escape. However, they probably didn’t run far. We have already arranged for men to search the vicinity.”\nHis hoarse voice startled Ye Luan awake. Ye Luan had been healed by Qiu Tong’s supernatural powers and was now fine.\n“Auntie Qiu! Qiu Xingyuan and Little Yu are both outside. I’ll bring you to find them…”\nYe Luan hurriedly ran to Qiu Tong’s side. His small hand gripped Qiu Tong’s palm, wanting to immediately bring her out.\nQiu Tong looked at Jin Yang with furrowed brows. Jin Yang nodded slightly and said, “I need to lead a team to search for the terrorists’ accomplices in this building. I also need to settle their statements…”\n“Let them accompany you. They will take care of you when you encounter danger.”\nJin Yang gestured at the president’s guards with his eyes. They promptly formed two lines and followed Qiu Tong out of the hospital building.\nWhen Qiu Tong reached the door, she turned to look at Jin Yang’s lonely figure standing by the window. She had a nagging feeling that there was something wrong.\nHowever, the children were not out of danger yet. Qiu Tong had no choice but to shift all her attention away from Jin Yang.",

      "content": "Chapter 193: Xiao Zhen Tries To Kidnap\nAt the corner of the street opposite the hospital, Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao hid in a corner while protecting Little Yu. They looked warily at a man who was smiling wickedly at them.\nXiao Zhen tried to coax and deceive the children. He turned around and signaled his subordinates to block the street to prevent the children from escaping.\n“I am a good person. I’ll bring you to find your family now. Don’t be afraid!”\nSeeing that they were still on their guard, Xiao Zhen wanted to grab Qiu Xingyuan impatiently. Seeing this, Qiu Xingqiao opened his mouth and bit his palm.\nThe child’s sharp teeth pierced into Xiao Zhen’s skin. He shook his hand in pain and finally shed his fake smile to reveal a ferocious expression.\n“You brats must suffer a little before you can be obedient.”\nXiao Zhen waved his hand and had his subordinates knock them out and take them away. Unexpectedly, he heard a shout from afar. “Stop!”\nYe Luan led Qiu Tong to the vicinity of the children’s temporary hiding place. They saw Xiao Zhen trying to kidnap the children.\nQiu Tong immediately recognized that the man in front of her was the lieutenant who had wanted to kidnap the children from the villa!\nHad he not given up?!\nWhen Xiao Zhen saw that it was a woman, he heaved a sigh of relief and gestured for his subordinates to stop Qiu Tong and the rest. He took out a handkerchief and wiped at Qiu Xingqiao’s teeth marks. His eyes were filled with dissatisfaction as he muttered, “I thought it was those mercenaries who came back. Get rid of them quickly. Don’t delay me from taking the children away!”\nQiu Tong looked at the thugs running towards them with a look of disdain.\nThe president’s guards whipped out their batons. They had undergone special training and were naturally agile and sharp.\nThe thugs realized that they were no match for the guards, so they focused their attacks on Qiu Tong.\n“Bah, you specialize in picking on the weak. Are you worthy of your uniform?”\nQiu Tong sneered coldly. She picked up a beer bottle from the ground and threw it at one of the approaching thugs. Glass fragments scattered all over the ground and a few drops of blood trickled down the thug’s forehead. He swayed and fell to the ground. Qiu Tong kicked his head and said in disdain, “Trash!”\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao heaved a sigh of relief when they saw that Qiu Tong and the others had the upper hand.\nLittle Yu cheered Qiu Tong on. “Mommy! Beat them all down! Mommy, you can do it!”\nXiao Zhen sensed that something was wrong. He saw that his subordinates were helpless and crushed by Qiu Tong.\nHe quickly shouted, “Stop fighting, it’s just a misunderstanding!”\nXiao Zhen’s subordinates retreated in a sorry state. Qiu Tong waved at Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao. They hurriedly ran to her side, under the protection of the president’s guards.\n“Are you the children’s mother?”\nXiao Zhen tidied the folds of his clothes and put on a kind and hypocritical look as he walked to Qiu Tong and said, “I was passing by and saw that they were being bullied by bad people. There were no adults who could protect them, so I wanted to bring the children to a safe place.”\n“This is all a misunderstanding. I was the one who saved the children. How did things turn out this way?”\nXiao Zhen was rather daring in his claims. Qiu Tong frowned and stared at his face. He did not look ashamed at all. Little Yu, who had been hiding behind Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao, quietly stuck her head out. She said in a small voice, “That’s not what happened!”\n“You’re a bad person who wanted to kidnap us!”\n“We already said that we were waiting for Mommy here. Besides, Eldest Brother and Second Brother managed to hide very well…”",

She widened her black grape-like eyes and said, “It was Brother Ye Luan who saved us.”\n“Uncle Ke Le told us to hide here and wait for them and Mommy to come back. They went to chase after the other baddies!”\nQiu Tong raised her hand and gently rubbed the top of Qiu Xingyu’s head. Qiu Tong’s heart ached when she saw the little girl still trying to be strong even when her face had already turned pale from fright.\nShe hugged Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao and said in a low voice, “Don’t be afraid, Mommy will protect you!”\nXiao Zhen did not expect the children to be so smart and bold. Even though his lie had been exposed, he was not the least bit embarrassed. Instead, he walked up to Qiu Tong and tried to worm his way into her good books. The president’s guards saw his actions and promptly held out their batons, gesturing for him to stay put.\nXiao Zhen’s eyes darted around. He recalled that he was not in the villa when the children were kidnapped.\nQiu Tong and her children would not recognize him. Xiao Zhen instantly put on a different expression and said, “Madam, I think your children are very smart and adorable. To be able to maintain such a clear-headed and calm state in such a dangerous environment, it’s obvious that you have taught them well.”\n“To be honest, I have some connections in the capital.”\n“If you want the children to be better educated and have a more expansive development environment, why don’t you consider coming to the capital with me?”\nXiao Zhen did not hide his motive at all. A mocking smile appeared on Qiu Tong’s face. Did this lieutenant take her for a fool?!\nQiu Tong shook her head. She said coldly, “Thank you for your kindness. We don’t need it.”\nXiao Zhen felt rather embarrassed by her merciless refusal. He immediately turned hostile and asked, “Why? I protected the children and prevented the terrorists from harming them. I’m your benefactor!”\n“Don’t you need to repay me?”\nQiu Tong was speechless at Xiao Zhen’s shamelessness. Her eyes revealed a murderous glint as she said, “Protected the children?”\n“The children all said that you wanted to kidnap them by force. I’m already being kind and forgiving by not calling the police and arresting you as an accomplice of the terrorists. Don’t test my tolerance anymore. It’s best not to continue tricking children on the streets.”\n“Your pathetic lies are sullying my ears!”\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes and looked at Xiao Zhen’s stunned and sheepish expression. She smirked and added. “Don’t let me see you near the children again. Otherwise, no matter what intentions you have, I won’t let you off so easily like today!”\nWith an unfriendly expression, Qiu Tong carried Little Yu and held Qiu Xingyuan’s hand. They left.\nXiao Zhen stared at their backs and cursed with a dark expression, “What a troublesome fellow.”\n“If she didn’t appear today, I would have already brought the children to the capital!”\nXiao Zhen turned around and saw that his subordinates’ faces were all bruised. He complained in disdain, “You are really a bunch of useless people.”\n“You can’t even defeat a woman! Looks like we have to get rid of that woman first if we want to bring them to the capital.”\nA murderous intent flashed across Xiao Zhen’s eyes. He wiped the corners of his lips with his fingers and said coldly, “If we turn the children into orphans, they won’t have a mother to rely on and will listen to us…”",

Were they in cahoots with Yu Ge?\nQiu Tong thought about it with a heavy heart. She recalled how the children had nearly been kidnapped several times and felt that danger was lurking around them all the time.\nWho was that mysterious man?\nWhat was his motive and motive for pretending to be Song Yan to get close to her and the children?\nQiu Tong’s eyes were filled with anxiety and conflicted emotions. She surveyed her surroundings warily, trying to detect any suspicious figures.\nShe had to flush all the hidden forces as soon as possible and find out the identity of that mysterious man!\nQiu Tong made up her mind. She carried Little Yu back to the hospital and found Jin Yang, who was leading a team to search the hospital building.\nJin Yang heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that the children were safe and sound. He nodded and gestured for his guards to retreat two steps away.\nQiu Tong looked at the remaining terrorists who were locked up in the room. They were all wounded. She could tell that Jin Yang had interrogated them. “Can I ask you for a favor?”\nQiu Tong said softly, pretending to be helpless and flustered. “Just now, there were some people who wanted to kidnap the children.”\n“The children are shocked, especially Little Yu. She can’t be alone now.”\nQiu Tong stole a glance at Qiu Xingyu, who was in her arms. Little Yu hurriedly nodded in agreement. Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao, on the other hand, rolled their eyes quietly, not responding to their mother’s exaggerated claims. Jin Yang frowned and looked at Qiu Tong, indicating for her to continue.\n“The children are young and don’t have the ability to protect themselves. I’m a woman and very weak…”\nQiu Tong said firmly and seriously, “We need protection. Can you please send the children back to the villa?”\n“I still have some things to settle. If they encounter any more danger or accidents on the way, I’m afraid I won’t be able to handle it!”\nQiu Tong clutched her chest. Jin Yang looked at her display of weakness in surprise, his eyes filled with bewilderment.\nThe president’s guards were standing very far away. When they heard Qiu Tong’s words, they felt like grumbling. However, due to Jin Yang’s special treatment of Qiu Tong and her children, they only dared to mutter on the inside. “She didn’t even blink when fighting against those thugs. She has excellent movement and technique that even big, strong men can’t get near her.”\n“Those children nearly crippled the hand of the bad guy who wanted to kidnap them. How are they weak?”\n“They still need the president’s protection?”\nJin Yang looked troubled. Seeing that he was still hesitant, Qiu Tong shifted Little Yu in her arms and took the opportunity to remind her, “Mommy has assigned Little Yu an honorable and important task. You must watch him closely for Mommy. You must not let him leave even half a step.”\n“You can’t let him disappear from your sight until Mommy comes back, understand?”\nQiu Xingyu’s eyes lit up as she nodded vigorously. She leaned on Qiu Tong’s shoulder and pretended to cry.\n“Uncle, can you hug me? It was so scary just now. I am so scared!”\nQiu Xingyu’s nose was red from crying. Jin Yang was a little flustered and hurriedly opened his arms to hug her.\nQiu Tong nodded silently and gave Qiu Xingyu a quick thumbs-up without Jin Yang noticing.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao looked at their sister and mother’s tacit cooperation and raised their hands to smack their foreheads in unison.",

      "content": "Chapter 196: Three Children Causing Trouble\nJin Yang drove the children back to the villa. Qiu Xingyu sat in the back row and held Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao’s hands, quietly transmitting Qiu Tong’s instructions.\nThe president’s car stopped at the entrance of the villa. Jin Yang planned to leave after settling the children down.\nHowever, Qiu Xingyu opened her arms and stood in front of him. She raised her pink cheeks and pursed her lips as she said, “Uncle, can you stay with us for a while longer? Mommy hasn’t returned yet, and Eldest Brother and Second Brother are already very tired. If the bad guys come over again, we’ll definitely be kidnapped!”\n“Didn’t you promise Mommy to take care of us?”\nQiu Xingyuan stared at Jin Yang coldly. He pursed his thin lips, which were somewhat similar to Jin Yang’s. “You can’t go back on your word after making a promise.”\nJin Yang looked at the children standing in front of him in a line. He didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as he explained, “I have things to do…”\nQiu Xingyu hurriedly pinched her own arm and burst into tears.\nQiu Xingqiao’s heart ached for his younger sister. He assumed a fighting stance with Jin Yang to stop him.\nHolding a baseball bat and staring fixedly at Jin Yang, Qiu Xingqiao blocked the door with his chin lifted stubbornly.\nQiu Xingyuan walked to the switch of the electric fence. With some chemical powder in his hand, he turned to look at Jin Yang.\nDid these children look like they could not protect themselves?!\nJin Yang squatted down with a doting and helpless tone. He raised his hand to wipe the tears off Qiu Xingyu’s face and said softly, “Look, you’re crying like a little kitten. I’ll stay and wait with you for Mommy to come home.”\n“Can you guys put everything down now?”\nJin Yang looked at Qiu Xingqiao and Qiu Xingyuan with a smile. “You are both very powerful. You will definitely be able to protect Mommy and your sister in the future.”\nQiu Xingyuan did not smile at his praise.\nHe looked coldly at Jin Yang. The two boys could sense the change in Mommy and sister’s towards him.\nThe two boys felt a little sour in their hearts. They were rather insecure and were naturally a little hostile towards Jin Yang’s presence.\nJin Yang carried Little Yu to the bathroom to wipe her face. The president’s guards remained in the living room. They looked at the pride and arrogance on Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao’s faces and could not help but raise their eyebrows and think to themselves. The president was so formidable. How did he end up being stopped by these two children?\nThe president’s guards wanted to show support for Jin Yang so they came up with the idea of teasing the children.\nThey quietly approached Qiu Xingyuan, wanting to restrain him. However, Qiu Xingqiao’s senses were extremely sensitive and he could sense the movements of the guards.\nQiu Xingyuan instinctively hid behind the sofa. His and Qiu Xingqiao’s movements were so practiced that it made one’s heart ache at the thought of what they must have been through.\n“What is happening? Are they bad people too?”\nQiu Xingqiao asked in a low voice. The president’s guards were unfamiliar faces. The children had never seen them before, but they were under Jin Yang so they hadn’t been guarded against them. Qiu Xingyuan could not tell either. But he could sense that they did not seem to be hostile. He frowned and said, “Don’t hurt anyone.”\nQiu Xingyuan took out a handful of powder from his pocket. Qiu Xingqiao forced the guards to retreat to the door.\n“What are you doing?”\nIt was Qiu Tong. She happened to return at this moment, only to see Qiu Xingyuan throwing the powder.\nQiu Xingyuan wanted to take back the powder, but it was too late. The president’s guards instinctively hid at the side. When Jin Yang came out of the washroom and saw the scene before him, he rushed over to Qiu Tong and hugged her…",

But she could not help peeping from between her fingers at the two of them hugging intimately.\nThe president’s guards looked away and coughed lightly to remind them to pay attention to their actions. Qiu Tong patted the powder off Jin Yang’s shoulder with a flushed face.\nShe frowned and stared at Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao. She asked softly, “What is going on?”\nJin Yang glared at the guards. He lowered his eyes to look at the woman in his arms and said, breaking the tense atmosphere, “Where did you go?”\nQiu Tong met his concerned gaze and remembered the sachet in her pocket. She took it out and handed it to Jin Yang.\n“It’s all thanks to your help today. This is my thank-you gift.”\nQiu Tong stuffed the sachet into Jin Yang’s hands. Her eyes lit up as she said, “I personally concocted this herbal powder. It can alleviate your headache, but you need to wear it on your chest 24/7. Remember not to remove it.”\nJin Yang lowered his head and smelled a sweet herbal fragrance. Seeing his stunned expression, Qiu Tong took the initiative to stand on her tiptoes and hang it around his neck.\nThe tips of their noses brushed against each other. Qiu Tong’s hair brushed across Jin Yang’s face, as if a pair of hands were playing with his heartstrings.\nHe instinctively wanted to wrap his hand around Qiu Tong’s slender waist, but Jin Yang saw from the corner of his eye that the children were staring at him. He could only stop and let his hands drop.\nQiu Tong’s palm touched Jin Yang’s chest and she felt his warmth. Her narrowed eyes flickered with satisfaction.\nShe had bought the sachet from the market and filled it with her homemade herbal powder.\nThe ingredients were generally inert, but when the wearer’s body temperature rose, they would emit a unique fragrance.\nQiu Tong could use this to confirm if the man in front of her was him or someone else!\nJin Yang pressed down on the medicine bag and said in a hoarse voice, “I’ll go back first.”\nWhen Qiu Xingyu heard his words, she immediately ran to Jin Yang’s side and shamelessly hugged his thigh. “Uncle will accompany me for a while more!”\nJin Yang looked at the darkening sky with a troubled expression. He could only rub Little Yu’s head and coax her, “Another day…”\nLittle Yu’s eyes darted around and she quickly found another request. “Then can Uncle come over this weekend?”\n“Bring us out to play this weekend!”\nLittle Yu pouted, her eyes instantly filling with tears as she mumbled, “The other children in the kindergarten all have their parents with them…”\n“They go to the amusement park and other places to play on weekends, but we’ve never done so!”\n“We can only play building blocks with Mommy obediently at home. Second Brother and Eldest Brother will lock themselves in their rooms. They also look forward to going out!”\nLittle Yu turned around and blinked her eyes, trying to get Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao to cooperate with her. However, they just watched her quietly with their arms crossed in exasperation.\nJin Yang’s heart ached for these sensible children.\nQiu Xingyu could tell that he was wavering. She held his palm with both hands and said, “Teacher assigned us to have a family outing this weekend. We have to write a diary entry on what we did. If Uncle doesn’t agree, I will have to be a liar and write a fake diary entry.”\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao looked at each other in confusion. When did their teacher give them such an assignment?\nQiu Tong took out her phone and looked through the homework information sent out by the kindergarten teacher, but she could not find any such assignment.",

      "content": "Chapter 198: Little Yu Lied\nQiu Xingyu saw that Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao were about to expose her. She hurried back to their side.\nSilence filled the living room. Qiu Xingyu pouted and puffed up her cheeks as she quietly stepped on Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao’s feet.\nQiu Tong and Jin Yang smiled helplessly at her childish actions.\nQiu Xingyu rubbed her eyes with the back of her hand and deliberately pretended to be pitiful as she sat on the ground. She stared at Jin Yang bitterly and asked, “Uncle, do you not like me? We just want to complete our homework. If Uncle will be inconvenienced by this, I won’t mention it again then…”\nJin Yang was completely defeated by her tactful move. He had no choice but to quickly agree to Little Yu’s request.\nJin Yang left the villa with the guards, while Qiu Tong sat on the sofa and patted the empty seat beside her. She waved Qiu Xingyu over and asked, “Homework?”\n“The whole family has to go out this weekend, and you have to write a diary entry about it?”\n“Didn’t Mommy say before that children are not allowed to lie? Little Yu… do you want to say something to Mommy?”\nQiu Tong was extremely patient. Her tone was gentle as she gave Qiu Xingyu a chance to explain. She did not directly reprimand or pressure her.\nQiu Xingyu lowered her head and looked at her fingers, not daring to look up at Qiu Tong.\nAfter a while, she said in a soft voice, “I’m sorry, Mommy. I lied. The teacher didn’t give us such an assignment.”\nQiu Tong frowned rather angrily, wanting to use a serious tone to remind her to be an honest child.\nBut in the next second, tears welled up in Qiu Xingyu’s eyes.\nShe pursed her lips aggrievedly and said in a choked voice, “I wanted Uncle to stay. Is that wrong?”\n“I’m so envious of other children who have fathers! They all have fathers who send them to and fro the kindergarten. Their whole family goes out to play on the weekends…”\n“But my brothers and I don’t have any such things! They bully us in the kindergarten and say that we are wild children that no one wants.”\nQiu Xingyu’s tears fell uncontrollably. Qiu Tong hugged her tenderly and patted her back guiltily.\nIt was all her fault. When the children were young, Qiu Tong did not create a warm and healthy family environment for them.\n“Eldest Brother wants to learn how to make medicine while Second Brother likes to fight. All so they can protect themselves and Little Yu!”\n“We don’t have a father, so people often bully us! Little Yu just wants Uncle to spend a weekend with us.”\nQiu Xingyu poured out all her grievances. She hugged Qiu Tong’s neck and wailed.\nQiu Tong’s gaze landed on Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao. They clenched their small fists and looked away. “Not us!”\nAlthough they denied it, Qiu Tong could still see the disappointment in Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao’s eyes.\nShe gently patted Qiu Xingyu’s back to comfort her.\nQiu Tong looked at the folded paper dragonfly Jin Yang had made for Little Yu on the sofa. She frowned in thought. Song Yan’s status was very high, while she was just a commoner. They were people from two different worlds. They should not have met each other, but they ended up together by chance.\nHowever, Song Yan was indeed very patient with the children. He always coaxed Little Yu gently and took special care to consider Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao’s pride and self-esteem.\nQiu Tong struggled and hesitated as she recalled the memories of their time together. It seemed like he didn’t dislike her either.\nPerhaps, for the children’s sake, she could try… to make Song Yan their “father”?",

      "content": "Chapter 199: Reminder From The Capital\nIn his temporary official residence in S City, Jin Yang sat on the sofa and touched the sachet on his neck with his fingers. It was a quiet night.\nShao An looked at Jin Yang, who maintained the same posture throughout the video call. He could not help but clear his throat and remind him, “Sir, since the unrest in S City has been quelled and the perpetrators have been subdued, shouldn’t you be back in the capital to take charge?”\nShao An scratched his head anxiously. He felt that he had lost a lot of weight in just a few days.\nThe news of Jin Yang leaving the capital was extremely difficult to suppress. Not only did Shao An have to deal with all the high-ranking officials who came to visit, he also had to entertain the old man.\n“Mr. Jin must have sensed that something was wrong. He called you several times at the official residence to contact you.”\n“I’ve covered for you using various reasons, but I can’t hide it for too long! Sir, can I book you a flight back to the capital tomorrow?”\nShao An probed, but Jin Yang frowned and stared at Shao An on the screen in dissatisfaction. He said coldly, “I still have some things to finish. I will contact you when I can return.”\nNews of the perpetrators being captured in S City had already reached the official residence in the capital. There was nothing else unusual that Shao An could see so he asked worriedly, “Are there any escaped suspects?”\nJin Yang looked at the sachet bag and replied calmly, “I’ve already agreed to accompany the children this weekend.”\nShao An eyes widened in shock. He hurriedly used his hands to close his slightly opened jaw. “What?!”\nThe president chose to abandon the government affairs of the capital and stay in S City to spend the weekend with the children?\nAll sorts of conjectures surfaced in Shao An’s heart. He probed softly, “Sir, are those children really your illegitimate children?”\nJin Yang’s expression was as cold as ice as he suddenly raised his eyes. He stood up and looked at Shao An. “You’ve been forgetting your position recently.”\n“It’s none of your business! Don’t let me hear any more speculations or discussions about Qiu Tong and the children…”\nEven though Jin Yang didn’t respond directly, his protective attitude towards Qiu Tong already proved that his relationship with the Qiu family was out of the ordinary.\nShao An risked being reprimanded. He stood in a military stance and said in a hoarse voice, “Sir, you better consider carefully about the Qiu family.”\n“The parliament will never allow the President to marry a commoner woman. Furthermore, Qiu Tong has three children. Their backgrounds…”\nA cold glint flashed across Jin Yang’s eyes. He hung up the phone before Shao An could finish speaking. He grabbed the hard liquor on the coffee table and took two large gulps.\nThe burning alcohol flowed down his throat to his stomach. With the burning sensation, Jin Yang regained some clarity.\nHe was confused by his current actions. Shao An’s reminder was right. As the president, he should maintain a distance from Qiu Tong.\nHowever, every time Jin Yang thought of Qiu Tong and the children, he would feel more light-hearted. He even looked forward to seeing them!\nJin Yang rubbed his temples, feeling a headache coming on. He didn’t know how to deal with this troublesome situation.\n…\nIn the blink of an eye, it was the weekend. Qiu Xingyu saw Qiu Tong’s extremely simple sportswear and her expression instantly turned serious.\nShe pushed Qiu Tong’s back and chased her into the changing room. “Mommy! We’re going out to play! You have to dress up!”\nQiu Tong was shocked and wanted to object, but Qiu Xingqiao crossed his arms and leaned against the door of the dressing room. He spat venomously, “All men like beautiful women. Who would want to be our father when they see you looking so disheveled?”\nQiu Xingyu stuffed a dress into Qiu Tong’s hands and urged her to change.\nQiu Tong had no choice but to obey the children’s orders. When she came out wearing light makeup and a pale blue tube dress, the three children widened their eyes at the same time—was their mommy really that beautiful?!",

      "content": "Chapter 200: Identity Confrontation\nIn the temporary official residence in S City, Jin Yang was dressed casually and looking at the mirror. He was prepared to go to the villa to fetch Qiu Tong and the children.\nJin Yang pushed open the door and saw Song Yan, who had been waiting outside for a long time. He stood up and greeted Jin Yang with a lazy and casual expression, “Morning!”\n“Where are you going? Let me guess, you’re going to meet Qiu Tong?”\nSong Yan spread out his hands with a mocking expression. He used his slender fingers to poke the sachet on Jin Yang’s chest. “This looks like it is mine.”\n“Shouldn’t you be returning it to me?”\nSong Yan knew about what happened between Qiu Tong and Jin Yang yesterday through the listening device. When he heard that Qiu Tong had given him a sachet, he knew that she must have sensed the disparities between him and Jin Yang, and wanted to use it to differentiate them.\nJin Yang frowned and rejected him with an unhappy expression. “I’ll return to the capital next week.”\n“I promised the children that I would spend the weekend with them…”\nSong Yan stuck the tip of his tongue against his teeth and revealed a mocking smile. A hint of disdain and provocation flashed across his eyes as he said, “The children want me to accompany them—not you pretending to be me! Jin Yang, when will you be able to recognize reality?”\nSong Yan raised his hand, wanting to snatch the sachet over. Jin Yang dodged instinctively.\nThe two of them quickly engaged in battle. Song Yan was very determined, but Jin Yang’s skills were better than his. In just two or three moves, he had pinned Song Yan against the door. Song Yan tried to break free several times but failed. His face was pressed against the cold wall. Even so, he could not help mocking, “You’re still so hypocritical. You promised to keep your distance from Qiu Tong, but what has happened in reality?”\n“You keep trying to find all sorts of ways to get close to her!”\nSong Yan tried to break free from Jin Yang’s hold and growled, “You’ve already taken everything that belongs to me!”\n“Do you still want to snatch my woman away?”\nSong Yan felt the grip on him loosening. His eyes were bloodshot as he questioned, “You are the president but you harbor ulterior motives towards your brother’s woman. Jin Yang, you’re really a gentleman! What a good brother!”\nJin Yang’s heart ached as if it was pierced by needles. Pain flashed across his eyes as he released his hand. He took off the sachet from his neck and threw it to Song Yan.\nSong Yan smirked as he rushed to the villa with the sachet.\nJin Yang sat at the doorway in frustration. The sensation of the sachet seemed to linger on his fingertips. He recalled Qiu Tong’s advice. “The herbal powder inside can relieve your headaches…”\nSomething was not right!\nJin Yang’s pupils constricted. Song Yan did not have headaches. If Qiu Tong was really with him, she would have known!\nIn that case, Qiu Tong did not know that Song Yan and he were two different people!\nJin Yang grabbed his car keys and immediately chased after Song Yan.\nAt the villa in the wealthy district, Song Yan knocked lightly on the door. Qiu Xingyu opened the door happily and pushed Qiu Tong in front of him.\nSong Yan looked at the dressed-up Qiu Tong and smiled in amazement. “Let’s go.”\nQiu Tong looked at him warily and pretended to probe. “It’s a little cold today. Are your headaches acting up?”\n“Do you have the sachet on you?”\nSong Yan smiled faintly and took out the sachet. He showed it to her and said, “This is a gift from you. How could I dare to forget it?”",

      "content": "Chapter 201: Confession At The Cinema\nIn the private theater, the children stood at the door excitedly, holding popcorn buckets as they waited for Qiu Tong and Song Yan.\nQiu Xingyu’s eyes flickered with excitement and joy. She tugged at Qiu Xingqiao’s sleeve and murmured softly, “Mommy and Uncle Song are so compatible!”\nQiu Xingqiao frowned and looked at Qiu Tong and Song Yan. Going against his conscience, he disagreed. “How are they compatible?”\nQiu Xingyuan had two bottles of cola in his arms. He pursed his thin lips. Although he looked a little reluctant, he kept glancing at Qiu Tong the entire time.\n“Uncle! I want to sit with you!”\nQiu Xingyu threw herself into Song Yan’s arms. She raised her head and stared at him with her sparkling eyes.\nSong Yan felt a little repulsed but he hid his emotions. He just looked at Qiu Tong and patted the top of Little Yu’s head comfortingly. “Uncle will sit with Mommy!”\nQiu Xingyu was taken aback. She immediately covered her mouth with her hand and nodded solemnly. She pushed Qiu Tong and Song Yan to sit in the last row.\nA cartoon comedy was playing on the projection screen. Laughter could be heard from the front row from time to time. Even Qiu Xingyuan’s eyes were lit up with glee.\nQiu Tong couldn’t help smiling when she saw their expressions.\nZap—\nQiu Tong reached into the popcorn bucket and ended up making contact with Song Yan’s fingertips. Sparks of static electricity flashed in the darkness.\nQiu Tong quickly drew back her hand. Song Yan smiled as he placed the popcorn in her arms. Their interaction was as intimate and natural as before, but somehow, she felt that something was amiss. “Sorry, I need to go to the washroom.”\nSong Yan nodded and moved aside. Qiu Tong rested her hand on the back of the chair, her jacket brushing against Song Yan’s knee.\nIn the corridor, a stealthy figure slowly approached. Yu Ge lowered his black cap and hid in the dark, staring at the theater door.\nEver since the failed ambush at the hospital, Yu Ge had been lying in wait outside the villa. When he saw Qiu Tong and Song Yan come out, he had been secretly following them.\nYu Ge gritted his teeth and touched the fresh scar on his cheek. His eyes lit up as he took out a handkerchief soaked in chemicals.\nAt the sink in the washroom, Qiu Tong let cold water run down her palms. Images of Song Yan and her together flashed across her mind…\nBang—\nThe door was pushed open from the outside. Yu Ge rushed behind Qiu Tong and covered her mouth with a handkerchief. “This time! No one can save you!”\n“Qiu Tong! You forced me to do this…”\nThe situation happened too suddenly. Qiu Tong inhaled a large amount of chemicals before hurriedly holding her breath. She picked up a big porcelain plate from the sink counter and threw it at Yu Ge.\nYu Ge tried to dodge and nearly tripped over the trash can.\n“Don’t move! Are you alright?”\nQiu Tong did not return for a long time. Song Yan sensed that something was wrong. He quietly came out to look for her and heard the noises coming out of the bathroom.\nHe supported Qiu Tong as he asked her with concern.\nYu Ge saw that the situation was unfavorable and hurriedly fled.\nQiu Tong frowned and shook her head. She supported herself with her hands against the sink. Song Yan held her by the waist and brought her to the theater next door.\nIn the dark environment, Qiu Tong’s face was flushed red and sweating profusely. When Song Yan saw her appearance, his heart suddenly surged with a strong impulse. It was as if there were voices clamoring and urging him in his mind. “Kiss her! Turn her into your woman!”\nSong Yan paused for two seconds. He squatted in front of Qiu Tong and stroked her cheek with his cold fingertips.\n“Where are you feeling discomfort? I can help you, as long as you are willing…”\nWith his index finger, Song Yan tucked a strand of Qiu Tong’s hair behind her ear. He bent over, wanting to kiss her.\nQiu Tong’s eyes suddenly widened. She pushed Song Yan’s chest with her palm. Their faces were so close that she could see her own reflection in Song Yan’s eyes. Taking advantage of Song Yan’s daze, she tore off the herbal sachet hanging from his neck.\n“Who are you! Why are you pretending to be him? What’s your motive for wanting to get close to me!”\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes and questioned warily.\nSong Yan frowned, his lips curling into a cold and indifferent smile. He asked, “What are you talking about? Why can’t I understand what you are saying?”\n“This is the herbal sachet you gave me to wear 24/7.”\nSong Yan wanted to grab her palm, but Qiu Tong retracted her hand in disdain. “No, you’re not him!”\n“Anyone who wears this herbal sachet for 24 hours will be infused with its fragrance.”\n“But you don’t smell of it at all. In other words, you snatched this herbal sachet from him!”\nQiu Tong stepped away from Song Yan and demanded in a cold tone, “Who are you!”\nSong Yan had his hands in his pockets. In the dim light of the theater, he casually admitted, “I’m Song Yan.”\n“Your so-called ‘him’ is the one who used my identity to deceive you.”\nSong Yan raised his eyebrows and explained calmly, “Jin Yang, the president who lives in the capital used my identity to deceive you and get close to you.”\n“He just wants to flirt with you before making me take the blame for everything. That way, he won’t have to take any responsibility.”\nQiu Tong’s pupils constricted. So their first encounter had been a sham?",

Her vision turned blurry and her palms were covered in sweat.\nSong Yan paused for a moment and slowly walked to Qiu Tong’s side. He said in a bewitching voice, “Jin Yang has always been selfish.”\n“He takes very good care of you and the children for a hidden motive. He treats you as his prey and will abandon you without any mercy!”\n“No one understands Jin Yang better than me. In the beginning, I got close to you because I wanted to see what he wanted to do with using identity…”\n“But now, I just want to be with you. Forget about Jin Yang. I will treat you very well!”\nSong Yan stared at Qiu Tong with a profound expression. He leaned over and stroked Qiu Tong’s cheek with his finger. Seeing her dazed expression, he moved his thin lips closer.\nIn the quiet theater, one could almost hear their hearts beating.\nA trailer for a romantic movie was playing on the background screen. Qiu Tong wanted to push Song Yan away, but her limbs were limp.\nSong Yan kissed Qiu Tong’s earlobe and said with closed eyes, “Perhaps with Jin Yang faking my identity to get close to you, it was just the heavens giving us the chance to meet. It was fated. We should follow our destiny and follow our true hearts!”\nJust as his thin lips were about to kiss Qiu Tong, a fist came from the left and landed accurately on Song Yan’s face.\nThump!\nCaught off-guard, Song Yan took two steps back. He could taste the blood in his mouth. He raised his hand and used his thumb to wipe the blood at the corner of his lips.\nJin Yang was panting slightly. Qiu Tong bit the tip of her tongue and relied on the sharp pain to cling onto her consciousness.\nShe looked at the two identical-looking men and smiled self-deprecatingly. “I’m really stupid to have been fooled by you.”\n“I’m sorry, let me explain!”\nJin Yang saw Qiu Tong’s indifferent gaze and opened his mouth in a panic.\nSong Yan interrupted him and said provocatively, “What are you doing here?”\n“Mr. President, it’s better not to meddle in other people’s business! You have a special status. If others see this, there might be trouble.”\n“Don’t forget what you promised! Since you promised to leave Qiu Tong and not pester and deceive her, why are you looking for her now?”\nSong Yan deliberately scolded Jin Yang with words that could confuse Qiu Tong’s mind.\nQiu Tong looked at Jin Yang coldly. He felt rather uneasy and couldn’t find the right words to explain or clarify the misunderstanding.\nSong Yan took the opportunity to stir things up. “I already asked you back then. If you have feelings for Qiu Tong, you could tell me and I would help you explain to her!”\n“I would even help cultivate an opportunity for you two, but what did you say? You denied it!”\n“You promised me that you would never appear in front of Qiu Tong and affect our relationship, but you went back on your promise and confused her again and again!”\n“Jin Yang, is this how you show your sincerity?”\nSong Yan’s every word was like a sharp knife, slashing open a wound between Qiu Tong and Jin Yang that would be difficult to heal.\nJin Yang was at a loss for words. He lowered his face in silence and said in a gloomy voice, “I’ve made many wrong decisions before, but you can’t take Qiu Tong away today! She doesn’t want to be with you. I can’t let you…”\n“Hehe, you will always find an excuse for yourself!”\nSong Yan’s eyes were filled with hostility and disdain as he said, “You just want to snatch my woman! You always liked stealing things that belong to me!”\nJin Yang didn’t defend himself. He knew that any further explanation would be redundant. “My guards are outside. You won’t be able to bring her away.”\nSong Yan sneered. He shook his head and asked with a smile, “Are you using your status to threaten me?”\nHearing their argument, Qiu Tong stood up shakily. Stunned, she supported herself on the seat and growled, “Shut up!”\n“I’m not a toy for you two brothers to fight over!”\n“I don’t want to see either of you. Get lost!”\nIn the theater next door, the cartoon had finished playing. Qiu Xingyuan, Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu noticed that Qiu Tong and Song Yan had disappeared without a trace. They hurriedly ran out to look for them.\nThey followed Qiu Tong’s voice and pushed open the door.\nQiu Xingyu could not help rubbing her eyes. She tugged at Qiu Xingqiao and saw that he was also so shocked that his mouth was agape. She asked in a soft voice, “Second Brother, am I seeing things? Why are there two Uncle Songs?”\nEven as Qiu Xingyuan was in shock, he realized that there was something wrong with Qiu Tong’s condition.\n“Mommy, what’s wrong?”\nQiu Xingyu and Qiu Xingyuan stood by Qiu Tong’s side supporting her, their eyes filled with worry. She secretly sized up the two “Uncle Song Yan” in front of her.\n“Who’s real and who’s fake?”\nJin Yang didn’t know how to explain. He could only rub the top of Qiu Xingyu’s head out of habit. “Little Yu, don’t be afraid.”\nHowever, just as his hand was about to touch Qiu Xingyu, Qiu Xingyuan pulled his sister behind him and stared at Jin Yang warily.. His little face was tense. “Don’t touch her!”",

She could not walk.\nJin Yang hugged her tightly in his arms. He turned around and glared at Song Yan, warning him not to follow them. He left the theater with the children.\nIn the villa area, Qiu Tong forced a smile as she looked at Qiu Xingyuan. “Qiu Xingyuan, Mommy is fine.”\n“Be good and take care of your siblings. Mommy and Uncle have something to talk about.”\nQiu Tong walked into the bedroom with the children looking at her worriedly. When the door closed, she fell to the ground weakly, gasping heavily.\nYu Ge had been very vicious with the potency of the chemicals used. In addition, the matter of Song Yan and Jin Yang also had Qiu Tong’s head spinning.\nIf she continued to waste time, it might affect her body. Qiu Tong forced herself to get up.\nJin Yang comforted the children before following her into the bedroom.\nHe was filled with guilt and self-reproach. He wanted to explain, but saw Qiu Tong lying on the ground. Jin Yang picked her up anxiously. “I’ll go find a doctor!”\nQiu Tong suddenly opened her eyes and stared at him. She said in a low and hoarse voice, “No…”\nShe did not harbor any expectations for the skills of the doctors in this place. The chemicals which Yu Ge used would definitely not be something that ordinary doctors would have the antidote for.\n“Please bring me to the bathroom.”\nQiu Tong spoke in a polite and distant tone. Jin Yang felt a sharp pain in his heart when he saw her remote expression.\nHe held Qiu Tong by the waist and pushed open the bathroom door.\nQiu Tong’s gaze landed on the bathtub in the corner. She could heal herself with her superpower, but she needed to soak her entire body in warm water.\nAt this moment, the chemicals in her body had taken effect and her limbs were so numb that she could not move at all.\nQiu Tong lowered her eyes and pondered for a long time. She slowly closed her eyes and said, “Help me take off my clothes and turn on the hot water.”\nJin Yang was taken aback, but he quickly understood that she wanted to use her supernatural powers.\nHe quietly approached Qiu Tong, his cold fingers touching her burning skin.\nThe noise of the zipper being undone sounded especially clear in the quiet space. Jin Yang’s Adam’s apple bobbed. He slowly took off Qiu Tong’s dress and placed his slender fingers on the clasp of her bra. Click. Qiu Tong’s bra fell to the ground…\nIn the mirror, Qiu Tong’s skin was pink, and her wonderful figure was displayed in all its full glory.\nJin Yang slowly squatted down and grabbed the edge of her panties with his fingertips. His fingertips brushed past Qiu Tong’s inner thigh and she fell into Jin Yang’s arms, trembling.\n“Put me in there, thanks.”\nQiu Tong could feel the warm, hard object pressing against her hips. Her voice was hoarse, her tone a little teasing.\nJin Yang took a deep breath and adjusted the temperature of the water. He held Qiu Tong’s slender waist with his rough hands and slowly lowered her into the bathtub.\nWarm water surrounded Qiu Tong. She closed her eyes and slowly used her power to expel the chemicals from her body.\nThe steam in the bathroom drifted up. Jin Yang turned around to avoid eye contact, only to see the glass mirror hanging on the wall.\nIn the mirror, Qiu Tong slowly stroked every inch of skin on her body. She raised her neck, her fingertips lightly touching her chest as her legs bent slightly…\nJin Yang’s eyes were bloodshot as he clenched his fists. His body was tense as he endured the waves of instinct and the most primitive urge.\nThe effects of the chemicals subsided and Qiu Tong regained her faculties. She reached out and pulled out a towel, saying coldly, “Please leave.”\nJin Yang opened his mouth to say something, but quickly gave up and left.\nQiu Tong wrapped her body tightly in her bathrobe and walked out of the bathroom barefooted. She saw Jin Yang standing there. “If there’s nothing else…”\n“Mr. President, please leave my home as soon as possible and never appear in front of me and the children again.”\nHer words were like a huge rock flung straight at Jin Yang.\nHe felt as if someone was squeezing his heart, making it impossible for him to breathe.\nJin Yang suddenly took two steps forward, trying to grab Qiu Tong’s wrist. However, she dodged, her eyes filled with vigilance and resistance.\nHe lowered his hands helplessly. “I didn’t mean to lie to you.”\n“When I first met you, it was under special circumstances. I had no way of determining who sent you and whether you were deliberately trying to get close to me.”\n“Using Song Yan’s identity is a habit I’ve had for many years. I thought that we wouldn’t meet again…”\nJin Yang’s face was haggard and the dark circles under his eyes proved that he hadn’t had a good rest for many days. Qiu Tong smiled in amusement at his explanation. “Well, can you finally confirm that I’m a good person now?”\n“Ever since we met that day, there have been countless opportunities for you to clarify things, but did you? You and Song Yan kept treating me like a fool!”\n“If I did not get suspicious, you two would continue this childish game, right?”\nQiu Tong questioned angrily, “What do you take me for? A toy for you two brothers? The spoils of a silly war between you and him?”\n“No, no!”\nJin Yang frowned and wanted to refute, but he saw the coldness in Qiu Tong’s eyes.. He swallowed the words he was about to say and said, “I’m sorry.”",

      "content": "Bathroom Treatment\n\"Let's go home.\"\nQiu Tong wanted to hold the children's hands, but her legs went limp the moment she stood up. She could not walk.\nJin Yang hugged her tightly in his arms. He turned around and glared at Song Yan, warning him not to follow them. He left the theater with the children.\nIn the villa area, Qiu Tong forced a smile as she looked at Qiu Xingyuan. \"Qiu Xingyuan, Mommy is fine.\"\n\"Be good and take care of your siblings. Mommy and Uncle have something to talk about.\"\nQiu Tong walked into the bedroom with the children looking at her worriedly. When the door closed, she fell to the ground weakly, gasping heavily.\nYu Ge had been very vicious with the potency of the chemicals used. In addition, the matter of Song Yan and Jin Yang also had Qiu Tong's head spinning.\nIf she continued to waste time, it might affect her body. Qiu Tong forced herself to get up.\nJin Yang comforted the children before following her into the bedroom.\nHe was filled with guilt and self-reproach. He wanted to explain, but saw Qiu Tong lying on the ground. Jin Yang picked her up anxiously. \"I'll go find a doctor!\"\nQiu Tong suddenly opened her eyes and stared at him. She said in a low and hoarse voice, \"No…\"\nShe did not harbor any expectations for the skills of the doctors in this place. The chemicals which Yu Ge used would definitely not be something that ordinary doctors would have the antidote for.\n\"Please bring me to the bathroom.\"\nQiu Tong spoke in a polite and distant tone. Jin Yang felt a sharp pain in his heart when he saw her remote expression.\nHe held Qiu Tong by the waist and pushed open the bathroom door.\nQiu Tong's gaze landed on the bathtub in the corner. She could heal herself with her superpower, but she needed to soak her entire body in warm water.\nAt this moment, the chemicals in her body had taken effect and her limbs were so numb that she could not move at all.\nQiu Tong lowered her eyes and pondered for a long time. She slowly closed her eyes and said, \"Help me take off my clothes and turn on the hot water.\"\nJin Yang was taken aback, but he quickly understood that she wanted to use her supernatural powers.\nHe quietly approached Qiu Tong, his cold fingers touching her burning skin.\nThe noise of the zipper being undone sounded especially clear in the quiet space. Jin Yang's Adam's apple bobbed. He slowly took off Qiu Tong's dress and placed his slender fingers on the clasp of her bra. Click. Qiu Tong's bra fell to the ground…\nIn the mirror, Qiu Tong's skin was pink, and her wonderful figure was displayed in all its full glory.\nJin Yang slowly squatted down and grabbed the edge of her panties with his fingertips. His fingertips brushed past Qiu Tong's inner thigh and she fell into Jin Yang's arms, trembling.\n\"Put me in there, thanks.\"\nQiu Tong could feel the warm, hard object pressing against her hips. Her voice was hoarse, her tone a little teasing.\nJin Yang took a deep breath and adjusted the temperature of the water. He held Qiu Tong's slender waist with his rough hands and slowly lowered her into the bathtub.\nWarm water surrounded Qiu Tong. She closed her eyes and slowly used her power to expel the chemicals from her body.\nThe steam in the bathroom drifted up. Jin Yang turned around to avoid eye contact, only to see the glass mirror hanging on the wall.\nIn the mirror, Qiu Tong slowly stroked every inch of skin on her body. She raised her neck, her fingertips lightly touching her chest as her legs bent slightly…\nJin Yang's eyes were bloodshot as he clenched his fists.

      "content": "Chapter 205: Threat\nThe atmosphere instantly turned icy cold as Qiu Tong confronted them with a murderous expression.\nSong Yan narrowed his eyes and walked over to Qiu Tong with a smile.\nHe held the muzzle of his gun and looked at the children.\nSong Yan’s voice was lazy and slow, but it carried a hint of warning. “As the biological father of the children, you have no right to chase me away. I can obtain custody and visitation rights of the children through legal means…”\n“Simply put, if I go to the courts, there’s a good chance you won’t be able to stay with the children.”\nSong Yan frowned, his expression somewhere between sympathy and sarcasm. He deliberately made a tsk-tsk sound as he shook his head and slowly squatted down.\n“Do you want to have a happy, complete family or do you want to leave her?”\nSong Yan threw the option to the children as he pointed in Qiu Tong’s direction.\nLittle Yu clutched the corner of Qiu Tong’s clothes tightly in a rather dignified but helpless manner. Song Yan gently ruffled the top of her head and said in a low voice, “Perhaps you can persuade Mommy.”\n“I remember. You used to like me a lot.”\nSong Yan raised his eyebrows, but Little Yu was so frightened that her face turned pale.\nQiu Xingyuan shielded her behind him and stared at Song Yan warily. He said coldly, “Please leave our home.”\n“We will never leave Mommy!”\n“Even if this goes to court, I am able to think independently for myself. The judge will take my opinion into consideration and not listen to you!”\nQiu Xingyuan put on a stubborn expression, his eyes flickering with determination.\nThis was the first time he had expressed his reliance and protectiveness towards Qiu Tong. Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu looked at him with widened eyes.\nQiu Tong paused when she heard this. She was very touched. She also understood that Jin Yang and Song Yan had special status. It would be extremely disadvantageous for her to bring this matter to court.\nBut given the current situation, she absolutely could not show any fear or retreat.\nNo one could take the children away from her!\nQiu Tong’s gaze was sharp. She pointed the gun at the floor beside Song Yan and suddenly pulled the trigger. With a loud bang, the air was filled with the smell of gunpowder. There was now a hole in the ground and white smoke swirled out of the gun barrel.\nSong Yan looked at her in disbelief. He stood up stiffly and frowned. “As long as we are together, we can resolve all problems. I will help you take care of the children. Isn’t that the best choice?”\n“Why are you still hesitating?”\nQiu Tong glanced at Jin Yang and Song Yan. “I won’t forgive you for plotting to get close to me and deceiving the children.”\n“If you still refuse to leave, my next shot might hit you!”\nQiu Tong reloaded the gun and raised it.\nQiu Xingyuan held Little Yu’s hand tightly. He and Qiu Xingqiao stood at Qiu Tong’s side as protectors.\nQiu Xingqiao pointed at Jin Yang and Song Yan angrily. He whispered into Little Yu’s ear, “Sister, you have to remember this.”\n“No man who looks like them is good! They’re all baddies! In the future, when you see them, you have to avoid them. Don’t be fooled!”\nLittle Yu looked at Jin Yang in confusion. Her lips moved as she wanted to defend her uncle, but she sensed that now was not the right time. She could only nod obediently.\n“Brother, don’t worry. I’ll remember!”\nJin Yang and Song Yan looked at each other in exasperation.\nQiu Tong felt comfort when she looked down at Qiu Xingyuan. She suddenly remembered the officer who had tried to kidnap the children outside the hospital. All her doubts seemed to have been cleared up as she stared at Song Yan suspiciously…\nSong Yan and the officer appeared beside her and the children at almost the same time.\nCould all the dangers they encountered be related to Song Yan?\nQiu Tong’s entire body tensed up as she glared at Song Yan. She questioned coldly, “Did you have anything to do with those people waiting outside the hospital, waiting for an opportunity to kidnap the children? Did you arrange it?”\nSong Yan was a little stunned, but he could sense the change in Qiu Tong’s attitude.\nThe children were Qiu Tong’s lifeline and weakness.\nSong Yan did not answer directly. He raised his hand and tugged at the collar of his shirt, his fingertips playing with his messy hair. “As long as we are together, any problem can be solved and you will be safe.”\nQiu Tong’s dark eyes were filled with anger as she gritted her teeth.\nJin Yang noticed the change in her mood and hurriedly apologized, “I’ll explain to you another day.”\nHe strode over to Song Yan and gripped his shoulders tightly, dragging him out of the villa.\nThump!\nQiu Tong closed the door to the villa and threw the gun to the ground.\nThe children surrounded her with worried expressions. Qiu Tong looked up and opened her arms to hug them.\n“Don’t be afraid, Mommy won’t let anyone snatch you away!”\nThis promise made Qiu Xingyu cry loudly. Qiu Xingyuan also took the initiative to hold Qiu Tong’s finger with reddened eyes.\nQiu Xingqiao clenched his small fists and said fiercely, “If they dare to come knocking on our door again, I’ll kick them all out!”\nQiu Tong burst out laughing at his actions and planted a gentle kiss on each child’s face.\n“Let go of me!”\nSong Yan shook off Jin Yang’s hand and stared at him in disdain. “Don’t keep looking at me like that. Qiu Tong and the children are mine.”\n“Don’t tell me the president wants to have the bad reputation of committing incest?”",

      "content": "Chapter 206: Lawsuit\nJin Yang clenched his fists and stared at Song Yan silently. He then issued a direct warning. “Don’t go near them again!”\n“If you insist on causing trouble, I will definitely use my status to chase you out of this city. I won’t have any mercy even on account of our past ties.”\nSong Yan gently patted off his sleeves, a mocking and dark expression flashing across his eyes.\nHe straightened his collar and raised an eyebrow at Jin Yang. “You dare to let Jin Tao know of Qiu Tong’s existence?”\n“My dear President, you should understand the situation. The love between the president and a civilian may sound very romantic and touching, but Qiu Tong and the children will be the ones hurt in the end! On the other hand, I’m different. I’m their best choice. Qiu Tong will understand sooner or later!”\n“I will continue to use legal means to fight for my rights. Just wait and see!”\nSong Yan left with his hands in his pockets.\nJin Yang stood under the streetlamp outside the villa district. The light elongated his figure, but he looked extremely lonely.\n…\nIn the bedroom, Qiu Tong searched for hundreds of photos of Jin Yang and Song Yan. She projected them onto the wall and carefully analyzed them.\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes and stared quietly at the two identical faces until she discovered the red mole!\nShe closed her eyes and recalled the injured man she had picked up by the roadside. It was Jin Yang!\nMixed emotions surged in Qiu Tong’s heart. She opened the drawer and looked at some financial records. She felt a headache coming along and jabbed her own forehead with her finger.\nThe next morning, there was a knock on the door.\nQiu Tong, who had not slept the entire night, struggled to open her eyes. She pushed open the door in her sleeping robe and saw a mailman standing outside. “Are you Madam Qiu?”\n“This is a court summons. Please sign here to acknowledge receipt.”\nThe mailman held out a pen. His words were like a basin of cold water splashing all over Qiu Tong, waking her up completely.\nShe recalled Song Yan’s harsh words before he left yesterday and her heart gradually sank.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao came out of the room. They heard the mailman’s words. They looked at each other nervously and stood rooted to the ground in silence.\nQiu Tong opened the envelope and saw the notice written in black and white. She did not expect Song Yan to be so ruthless!\nFrom the full-length mirror, she saw Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao’s worried expressions. She deliberately put on a relaxed and natural expression, before casually stashing away the documents in the shoe drawer. She then summoned the children to the dining room for breakfast.\nQiu Xingyuan was the first to walk to her side. He took the initiative to help her carry the dishes.\nLittle Yu ran out of the bedroom barefooted. She held a crumpled drawing paper behind her back and said in a soft voice, “Mommy! This is a gift Little Yu and my brothers prepared for you. Do you like it?”\nQiu Tong wiped her wet hands on her apron and bent over to take it.\nThe drawing was a two-story villa drawn with a colorful crayon. Qiu Tong could vaguely make out the figures of herself and the three children surrounding her.\nQiu Tong rubbed the top of Little Yu’s head and kissed her face tenderly. She felt a trace of calmness and stability return to her heart.\nThe four of them sat around the dining table. Qiu Xingyuan took the initiative to pick up two slices of vegetables and placed them in Qiu Tong’s bowl.\nQiu Tong looked at him in surprise. Qiu Xingyuan shifted his gaze awkwardly and cleared his throat before muttering, “Eat more food. You haven’t been looking good recently. If your body fails, how are you going to protect us?”\nQiu Tong could not help chuckling. It had been a long time since the villa had such a friendly and harmonious atmosphere. But even so, there was an undercurrent of graveness and uneasiness.\nDing dong—\nThe doorbell broke the silence. Ke Le opened the door and saw Jin Yang standing outside.\nQiu Tong frowned and wanted to chase him away, but Jin Yang cut her off. “He’s a lawyer. You can consult him if you have any questions.”\nThe man holding the briefcase nodded at Qiu Tong. Qiu Tong glanced at the summons peeking out of the drawer and had no choice but to step aside to let the two of them in.\nIn the living room, the lawyer gained an understanding of the situation. He shook his head with a grave expression.\n“Miss Qiu, unfortunately, this lawsuit is very unfavorable for you.”\n“As the children’s biological father, Mr. Song Yan has the right to fight for custody of the children.”\n“Besides, you don’t have any fixed income source at the moment. You can’t provide stable living conditions for the children. Mr. Song Yan has an advantage over you in this aspect. Besides, his status…”\nThe lawyer smiled awkwardly. Qiu Tong nodded and said bitterly, “I understand.”\n“I will try my best to help you fight this lawsuit, but the chances of winning are not high. I advise you to think of other ways.”\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao were sitting on a high stool in the dining room, eavesdropping. When they saw Qiu Tong’s gloomy expression, they hurriedly ran to the lawyer and said in a clear voice, “The court has to consider our opinion. We will never follow him!”\n“He didn’t fulfill his responsibility of raising us, but now he wants to take us away? On what basis?!”\nQiu Xingyuan pursed his thin lips, his eyes filled with hatred as he gritted his teeth.\nQiu Tong suppressed her heartache. She gently pressed Qiu Xingyuan’s shoulder and said in a low voice, “Qiu Xingyuan, don’t scare your sister.”\nQiu Xingyuan turned and saw Little Yu biting her lips tightly. She looked like she was about to cry. Helpless, he could only let his arms droop down in silence.",

      "content": "Chapter 207: Winning The Lawsuit\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nQiu Tong consulted with her lawyer about the procedures and things to take note of in court.\nJin Yang casually picked up two glass cups and went to the kitchen. He took out a honey pomelo syrup from the fridge and brewed some drinks.\n“Take your time to discuss this. I’ll go accompany the children.”\nIn a very natural manner, Jin Yang handed the warm drinks to the lawyer. He spoke gently as he looked at Qiu Tong.\nQiu Tong ignored his gesture of goodwill. Her back remained facing him.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao hid at the corner of the stairs. They stared in the direction of Jin Yang and Qiu Tong. Two little heads were huddled together, discussing in low voices how to torture Jin Yang!\nSince he had deceived Qiu Tong, he had to pay a price!\nQiu Xingqiao’s eyes flickered. He ran back to his room and found the vegetable juice that he usually kept hidden. He quietly sneaked into the kitchen and found some hot mustard sauce. He mixed the two together and stirred the turbid liquid. He pinched his nose to prevent himself from smelling the pungent smell.\nQiu Xingyuan brought the juice to Jin Yang’s side and pushed it toward him without a word.\nJin Yang stared at him in surprise. The mustard sauce had settled at the bottom of the cup. The color was so striking that there was no way he hadn’t noticed it.\nHelpless, he held his forehead with one hand and asked with a bitter smile, “You want me to drink this?”\nQiu Xingyuan crossed his arms and nodded solemnly. He continued to stare at Jin Yang, looking like he would only leave after he finished drinking it.\nJin Yang sighed, his slender fingers grasped the glass cup. He held his breath as he gulped down the juice. The mustard burned his stomach as the stinging smell mixed with his insides.\nHe covered his thin lips with his hand, desperately trying to suppress his nausea.\n“It’s quite delicious.”\nJin Yang squeezed out a smile with difficulty. Qiu Xingyuan frowned and looked at him. His pupils quivered. “Liar.”\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao returned to the room. Jin Yang sat on the sofa with his hands covering his stomach. Qiu Xingyu had gotten two cups of yogurt from somewhere and stuffed them into his hands.\n“Thank you.”\nJin Yang spoke to the little girl gently. Qiu Xingyu’s eyes were sparkling, but she refused to speak to him.\nThe two of them looked at each other for a long time. Qiu Xingyu took out a piece of notepaper she always carried with her. She wrote down a few lines of words and quietly stuffed it into Jin Yang’s hand. She then turned her back to him and pretended like nothing had happened.\nJin Yang was amused by her adorable actions. He looked down at the elegant handwriting and his smile froze on his face.\n“My brothers said that you’re a liar who cheated Mommy and even wanted to swindle us away. Is that true?”\nJin Yang was feeling very conflicted. He wrote down his reply. “Uncle has lied to you before, but I had my reasons for doing so. I definitely don’t want to ruin your lives, nor do I want you and Mommy to be in danger. I want to help you.”\n“Uncle is not a bad person.”\nAfter Jin Yang finished writing, he rolled up the note and poked Qiu Xingyu’s shoulder with his fingertips.\nThe two of them were like children in kindergarten, sneaking notes to each other.\nQiu Xingyu bit her lips and looked at Jin Yang with her mouth pursed.\nShe stared at Jin Yang with clear eyes. Qiu Xingyu pricked up her ears to listen to the sounds in the bedroom. She wrote a few lines in a fluster.\n“I believe you.”\n“But my brothers hate you. They discussed chasing you away. Remember not to drink anything they give you in the future!”\n“I’ll help you persuade Mommy not to blame you.”\n“My brothers are actually very easy to coax. As long as you remember…”\nJin Yang received the note and looked at the densely packed small words that contained things to take note of regarding Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao. The corners of his mouth curled into a relaxed smile.\nQiu Xingyu looked at him nervously and expectantly. Jin Yang smoothed the crumpled piece of paper and carefully placed it in his pocket.\n“I will work hard.”\nQiu Xingyu smiled sweetly at his actions.\nShe heard the sound of the door opening and hurriedly ran to the other end of the living room, pretending that nothing had happened and maintaining a distance from Jin Yang.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao came out of the room. Taking advantage of the fact that they could not see her, Little Yu quietly pumped her fists in the air to cheer Jin Yang on. Her adorable actions were like pebbles dropping down and causing waves in Jin Yang’s heart.\nHis heart was filled with a bitter sweetness.\nQiu Tong understood from her lawyer how grave the situation was. Her expression became increasingly solemn as she twisted her fingers nervously.\nIn the evening, Qiu Tong respectfully escorted the lawyer out of the villa. She stood at the door for a long time without returning to her room.\nFootsteps came from behind. Qiu Tong thought it was Ke Le. She let her guard down and revealed a tired expression. “Looks like we have to pack our things and move out of this city. If you don’t want to leave with us, I can settle your compensation now…”\nShe could not take a risk with the children’s safety, to take a gamble on a mere 20% chance of winning this lawsuit.\nQiu Tong’s heart was heavy. Having not received a reply for a long time, she turned only to see Jin Yang behind her. His expression was full of pain. The two of them quietly averted their eyes from each other.\nJin Yang wanted to place a jacket on Qiu Tong’s shoulder, but she dodged it.\n“I have a way to help you keep the children with you.”",

      "content": "Chapter 208: Proposal To Get Married\nThe night breeze blew in from the window.\nQiu Tong stared at Jin Yang gloomily. She held up the court summons in Jin Yang’s and asked calmly, “What solution do you have?”\nJin Yang was leaning against the door with one hand in his pocket. When his eyes met Qiu Tong’s, coldness engulfed his entire body.\nHe immediately stood up straight, his throat tight with hesitation. He didn’t know how to begin.\nJin Yang took a deep breath and suggested in a tentative, “Song Yan and I are twins. Our DNA is the same.”\n“In other words, if the children and I undergo a paternity test, the results will be the same as Song Yan’s.”\n“If you want, we can get married. This way, Song Yan won’t be able to sue you for custody of the children…”\nAs Jin Yang explained the feasibility of this plan, Qiu Tong’s eyes turned increasingly cold. She suddenly curled her lips into a mocking smile. “So this is the solution? Jin Yang! I’m warning you, be it you, Song Yan, the president or any high-ranking official, no one can even dream of taking my children away from me!”\n“They are my children and have no links with anyone else!”\nQiu Tong was agitated and Jin Yang paused for a moment. He raised his slender fingers to rub the space between his brows, trying his best to lay out the current situation for her in a gentle tone. “Song Yan will never give up. Even if you move out of this city, he will still be able to find you.”\n“The children have their own friends in kindergarten. Do you want them to live a life of constant escaping and hiding with you?”\n“This is unfair to them. It is not a long-term solution.”\nJin Yang spoke the truth. Qiu Tong bit her red lips and looked away, wanting to avoid him. She clenched her fists and leaned against the corner of the desk.\nThe space was so quiet that only their breathing could be heard.\nJin Yang bent over and picked up the court summons from the ground. “I can find a lawyer to sign a prenup to protect you and the children’s interests.”\n“I can even clearly state that I will never sue for custody of the children. Compared to Song Yan, I am the better choice.”\n“Also, even after we get married, we will still stay in separate rooms. I won’t do anything outrageous during this period of time. You can rest assured about that.”\nJin Yang was confident. He would not force Qiu Tong to make a decision tonight. Instead, he would give her time to think.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao were hiding outside the door, eavesdropping on their conversation.\nQiu Xingqiao asked in a low voice, “Can we trust him?”\nQiu Xingyuan shook his head and brought Qiu Xingqiao back to the room. “Now that things have developed to this point, we have to rely on our own strength to survive this crisis. We can’t trust outsiders anymore! They might have other motives…”\nQiu Xingqiao’s lips parted. He clenched his fists and secretly swore. “Elder Brother, I will definitely protect our home!”\nAs time passed, Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao’s attitude towards Qiu Tong evolved from conflict to reliance.\nThey had seen the changes in Qiu Tong, and now, they considered her perspective before doing anything.\nAt night, Qiu Xingyuan quietly got up from the bed. He looked at Qiu Xingqiao, who was sleeping soundly, before quietly making his way to the study room.\nHe saw a faint light coming through the door crack. Qiu Xingyuan knocked softly on the door.\nQiu Tong studied the prenup she had received in her email inbox. She was still feeling conflicted when she heard a knock on the door. She closed the computer and opened the door.\n“Qiu Xingyuan? It’s so late. Why aren’t you asleep?”\nQiu Tong asked with concern.\nQiu Xingyuan lowered his arms and stood in the middle of the study room. After a moment of silence, he raised his head and stared at Qiu Tong with his dark eyes. “We are all willing to move away with you. The kindergarten syllabus is too juvenile for us. Qiu Xingyuan and I have already completed all our school work in advance on our own. We won’t lag behind in school.”\n“As long as we move to the outskirts of the countryside where communication is inconvenient, it will be difficult for them to find us.”\nQiu Xingyuan pursed his thin lips. Qiu Tong looked at him and suddenly squatted down with a sniffle. She rested her hands on Qiu Xingyuan’s shoulders and said in a nasal voice, “Sorry, Mommy didn’t handle it well and now, you have to worry about me.”\nDrip…\nHot tears fell on the back of Qiu Xingyuan’s hand. Momentarily taken aback, Qiu Xingyuan hesitated for a while before raising his small hand and patting Qiu Tong’s back.\nQiu Tong’s eyes flickered. Shaken, she hugged Qiu Xingyuan tightly in her arms and buried her face in the crook of his neck. “I’m sorry.”\nThis apology made Qiu Xingyuan feel a little lost and helpless. He could only stand there in a daze, letting Qiu Tong’s aura surround him.\n“No one can take us away. Even if they kidnap us, I will protect my siblings and find an opportunity to sneak out and run back to this villa to find you. Although you always beat and scolded us in the past, now…”\nQiu Xingyuan paused for a moment, before adding heavily, “You are the only person we will acknowledge as family.”\nQiu Tong couldn’t control her tears. She sat on the ground and covered her eyes with her hands. Tears trickled down her fingers.\nWith a straight face, Qiu Xingyuan gently reached out to wipe her tears. He muttered softly, “Why are you crying? Such an ugly sight.”",

      "content": "Chapter 209: Trying To Interact\nIt was almost dawn.\nQiu Tong buried her face in her knees as she pondered Jin Yang’s proposal through the night.\nShe could not be selfish and choose to hide or escape, while letting the children suffer with her!\nQiu Tong grabbed her phone and stared at the number on the screen.\nShe took a deep breath and pressed the call button. In the quiet room, Qiu Tong could hear her own heartbeat.\nThe phone rang for two seconds before being picked up. Jin Yang’s voice came from the other end. Qiu Tong nervously shifted away from the phone.\n“Qiu Tong?”\n“I need to respect the children’s wishes. If they can accept you, I’m willing to marry you.”\nClick.\nQiu Tong hung up quickly. Jin Yang was a little dazed as he grabbed his messy hair. When he regained his senses, he heaved a sigh of relief and smiled.\nMeanwhile, Qiu Tong threw her phone far away, forcing herself to forget the call she just made.\nThe next morning, Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao walked out of the bedroom yawning. When they heard busy noises in the kitchen, they stood rooted to the ground. The two boys rubbed their eyes at the same time, thinking that they were hallucinating.\nJin Yang heard them as he busied himself at the dining table. He waved and called out to them, “Come and have breakfast.”\n“I don’t know what you like so I’ve prepared Chinese, Western and fast food options.”\n“If you need anything else, just let me know. I’ll try my best to satisfy your requests.”\nThe corners of Jin Yang’s lips curled up as he tried to mimic the teacher in the parenting video. He felt his facial muscles stiffen, but he didn’t dare to show any signs of fatigue.\nQiu Xingyuan narrowed his eyes and stared at him with hostility.\nWhen Little Yu saw him, an expression of surprise and joy appeared on her face. She hurriedly ran to the kitchen and pulled out a chair. She opened her arms for Jin Yang to carry her onto the seat.\nShe took two bites of the bread and gave him a thumbs-up. “Delicious!”\nQiu Xingqiao looked at his sister, who had once again “defected” to the enemy side. He pressed his fist to his lips and coughed twice as a reminder.\nQiu Xingyu blinked, her black, grape-like eyes swivelling. She then put on a stubborn stance and pointed at the two boiled crabs in the bowl. “I want to eat this! Help me crack the shells… Eldest Brother, Second Brother, you two love to eat crabs. Come here quickly!”\nQiu Xingyuan surveyed the living room but did not see Qiu Tong. He sat down suspiciously, wanting to probe Jin Yang’s motive for being here.\nJin Yang’s fingers were long and slender. He used a tool to dismantle the crabs, looking as if he was performing a medical operation.\nHe carefully picked out the crab roe and meat and distributed them fairly to each child. He even thoughtfully prepared grated ginger and vinegar as accompaniments for the crab.\nSuch ingratiating behavior had no effect on Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao at all.\nThey quietly pushed the crab meat away and lowered their heads to eat their plain porridge.\nQiu Xingyu and Jin Yang exchanged glances. Qiu Xingyu shoved the crab meat into their bowls and mumbled, “Why are Eldest Brother and Second Brother throwing tantrums like silly kids?! You’ll only have the strength to fight Uncle when your stomachs are full!”\nShe had just blurted out Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao’s plan. Qiu Xingyuan sighed helplessly and had no choice but to compromise and eat.\nA sweet smile appeared on Little Yu’s face. She blinked and exchanged secret signals with Jin Yang.\n“Do something to gain sympathy!”\nQiu Xingyu took the opportunity to whisper those words to Jin Yang when he bent over to pick up something.\nJin Yang was momentarily taken aback. But he quickly understood and walked to the living room, bringing over a fruit platter.\nHe held a sharp fruit knife and purposely sliced an apple in a clumsy manner, “accidentally” cutting his own fingers.\nJin Yang cried out softly. Qiu Xingyu dragged half a box of tissues to his side with exaggerated movements. She glanced at Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao and shouted, “Aiyah, what should we do? Uncle is injured!”\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao looked up with cold expressions. Their thin lips parted slightly and their venomous tongues spat out mercilessly. “You can’t even do a simple task properly, idiot.”\nJin Yang’s breathing halted. He shook his hand awkwardly. “It’s alright, just a small injury.”\nQiu Xingyuan frowned and asked, “Why are you here? You’re not welcome here.”\nJin Yang knew that Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao would not be convinced so easily, but he did not expect the situation to be so tricky.\nHe lowered his eyes and handed them some milk without answering. “From today onwards, I’ll move to the villa to take care of you.”\n“If you encounter any problems, you can come to me anytime.”\n“I hope that you can rely on me…”\nQiu Xingyuan slammed his chopsticks on the dining table. He pursed his thin lips and said coldly with a resistant expression, “Relyh on a stranger? Do we look stupid to you? Don’t think you can fool us again!” He dragged Little Yu out of the dining room.\nJin Yang sighed helplessly. Taking care of a child was even more tiring than being the president!\nHe dragged his tired body back to the living room, only to see a band-aid on the coffee table.\nA glimpse of the corner of Qiu Xingyuan’s shirt flashed past the door. Jin Yang raised his eyebrows in surprise before curling his lips. It seemed like the situation was not that bad.\nQiu Tong stood on the second floor and witnessed the entire process of Jin Yang interacting with the children. Mixed emotions welled up in her heart.\nShe slowly drew back her fingers and flipped through the marriage agreement that the lawyer had given her.",

      "content": "Chapter 210: Gaining Their Consent\nIn the evening, the sun hung low in the sky. Qiu Xingyu stood on tiptoe and leaned against the window sill to look out.\nJin Yang lifted her up and saw the hammock and toys in the courtyard. He asked in a low voice, “Do you want to go out and play?”\nQiu Xingyu smiled joyfully.\nJin Yang turned around and asked Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao. They decisively and coldly rejected him.\nQiu Xingyu met their gazes and pouted as she lowered her head. She discreetly tugged at Jin Yang’s sleeve and gestured at her brothers.\nJin Yang understood what she wanted and deliberately raised his voice. “Then I’ll bring Little Yu out to play alone…”\n“It’s just that when a little girl goes out to play with a stranger. It’s best if your family can be by your side to protect you. Otherwise, it won’t be good if bad guys kidnap you.”\nJin Yang adjusted his tone to mimic how the teacher spoke in the parenting videos.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao’s faces darkened, but when they saw Little Yu’s expectant eyes, they could only swallow their words.\nThey changed into sportswear and waited at the door. “Hurry up.” They urged impatiently.\nJin Yang secretly high-fived Little Yu, a victorious smile on his face.\nIn the courtyard, Jin Yang helped Little Yu tie the hammock properly. He also thoughtfully adjusted the height of Qiu Xingqiao’s sandbags and other exercise equipment.\nIn the afterglow of the setting sun, Jin Yang accompanied the three children as they ran around the lawn.\nChildren from the villa district passed by their house and looked at the Qiu siblings with envy. They asked their own fathers, “Daddy, when can you play with me?”\nQiu Xingqiao was playing when he heard this. He stopped what he was doing.\nIn the past, they had also stood outside the houses of other families, envious that other children could have their parents’ company and a harmonious family.\nSuspicion and uncertainty hid in the depths of Qiu Xingyuan’s pitch-black eyes. He stared at Jin Yang’s back profile and quietly closed his fists in thought.\nAt night, Jin Yang brought the children back indoors.\nQiu Xingyuan stopped him and pointed to the room. “Can we talk?”\nJin Yang was stunned. The boy in front of him sounded as steady as an adult, even though his face was clearly that of a child.\nThere was a sharp ache in his heart. He nodded and followed Qiu Xingyuan into the room.\nThere were various laboratory test tubes and chemistry books on the desk, and the single bed was neat and clean.\nQiu Xingyuan stared at Jin Yang. “Our mother and us are not tools to be used.”\n“If you want to take revenge on Song Yan through us, you better give up on this idea. We won’t let you manipulate us!”\nQiu Xingyuan displayed obvious hostility. Jin Yang sat on the bench. He did not put on the airs of an adult. Instead, he treated the boy in front of him as an equal. “I never thought of using her or you children. I really want to take care of you.”\n“You can choose not to believe it, but I will use my own way to make you understand that I have no ill intentions towards you.”\nJin Yang said with sincerity. Qiu Xingyuan lowered his eyes and asked in a gloomy voice, “Can you promise to always take care of her and protect her?”\nThe atmosphere in the room was quiet. Jin Yang smiled and raised one hand in a solemn gesture. He swore. “I promise.”\n“Then… I agree.”\nAfter Qiu Xingyuan said that, the door was pushed open from the outside. Qiu Xingyu threw herself into Jin Yang’s arms excitedly, a wide grin on her face.\nQiu Xingqiao touched the tip of his nose awkwardly. Faced with Qiu Xingyuan’s probing glare, he explained weakly, “Little Yu insisted on eavesdropping. I had no choice…”\nQiu Xingyu suddenly thought of Qiu Tong, who had been hiding upstairs all day long. She hurriedly held Jin Yang’s hand and ran to the second floor.\nQiu Tong heard the commotion and was about to go out to check on the situation when she bumped into Jin Yang.\nQiu Xingyu pushed him into Qiu Tong’s room. She covered her mouth and chuckled. “Uncle, stay in the villa tonight!”\nJin Yang and Qiu Tong didn’t even have time to react before the door slammed shut from the outside.\nBy the time Qiu Tong guessed what Little Yu was doing and wanted to turn the door handle, it was already too late.\nShe and Jin Yang looked at each other and heard Little Yu shouting outside, “Little Yu will open the door for Mommy and Uncle tomorrow!”\nWhere did they learn all these tricks?\nQiu Tong coughed lightly and looked at Jin Yang. She pointed at the window and asked, “Why don’t you jump down?”\n“The second floor isn’t too high.”\nThe bathroom mirror was misted over. Qiu Tong was wearing a silk negligee with a deep V neckline, highlighting the curves of her good figure. Her wet hair hung on her shoulders and water dripped onto her neck, making Jin Yang’s throat feel dry. He shifted his gaze and said, “I can sleep on the floor.”\n“Don’t worry, I won’t do anything.”\nJin Yang’s words sounded superfluous and weird. His Adam’s apple bobbed as he steeled himself for Qiu Tong to chase him out.\nHowever, Qiu Tong just shrugged and opened the wardrobe. She took out a thin blanket and pillow and stuffed them into Jin Yang’s arms. “Sorry for the inconvenience, Mr. President.”\nJin Yang was a little stung by her way of addressing him. “We’ll settle the marriage procedures tomorrow. We should not delay any longer in case anything happens.”\nWith her back facing him, Qiu Tong stopped what she was doing for two seconds. She sorted through the necessary documents and nodded in agreement. “Alright.”",

      "content": "Chapter 211: New Neighbor\nThe next day, at the Civil Affairs Bureau.\nThe car stopped by the roadside and the Bureau Chief came out personally. He knocked on the tinted glass of the passenger seat with a respectful and flattering expression.\nJin Yang wound down the car window and handed over a leather folder filled with documents.\n“Don’t worry, I will settle it as soon as possible!”\nThe Bureau Chief accepted the leather folder. He was very curious and tried to peep at the backseat of the car.\nWhat kind of woman could capture the president’s heart?\nJin Yang sensed his intentions. He narrowed his eyes and leaned forward slightly to block the Bureau Chief’s view.\nHis voice was cold as he warned, “This matter must be kept a secret. There must not be any trace of this in your system.”\nThe Bureau Chief nodded hurriedly and turned around.\nAfter about 15 minutes, two red certificates with the official seals landed in Jin Yang and Qiu Tong’s hands.\nQiu Tong looked at the special marriage certificate bearing their names and casually stuffed it into her handbag.\nJin Yang nodded and the driver drove towards the villa. He turned his head, revealing his clear jawline as he said in a low voice, “I’ll be staying at the villa for the time being.”\n“Fine.”\nHe thought that the matter had been resolved.\nHowever, as the car drove into the villa district, Jin Yang opened the passenger seat door. The two of them were surprised to see Song Yan standing in the courtyard of the neighboring villa, pushing a lawnmower. He waved at them with a relaxed expression and whistled. “Hi!”\n“I didn’t expect you two to get legally married.”\n“Does that mean I have to call Qiu Tong my sister-in-law? You guys won’t mind if I move in next door, right?”\nSong Yan leaned against the lawnmower and raised an eyebrow at Qiu Tong. “I’ll come by your house for lunch later.”\n“I have some bad habits. For example, I can’t control my mouth when I’m hungry.”\n“If someone who is about to faint from hunger calls Jin Tao and inadvertently divulges something you want to keep secret, I’m afraid things won’t be good for you.”\nSong Yan threatened Jin Yang, who frowned and did not answer.\nThis was Qiu Tong’s home, and he would let her decide.\nNo matter what the consequences were, he would find a way to bear and resolve it.\nQiu Tong glanced at Song Yan tiredly. After saying “whatever”, she turned the doorknob and disappeared from sight.\nSong Yan walked to Jin Yang’s side and bumped his shoulder against his chest. He gritted his teeth with a dark expression. “I won’t give up so easily.”\n“By doing this, you only proved that Qiu Tong is special to you. This will just motivate me more to snatch her away from you!”\n“Jin Yang, you wait and see.”\nSong Yan pushed the door open and entered.\nThe children stared at him warily and with hostility. From his clothes, they could tell that the man in front of them was not Jin Yang.\nSong Yan did not mind. He went to the kitchen to help Qiu Tong prepare the ingredients for lunch. He grabbed a few vegetables and rinsed them under the tap. Amidst the splashing water, he said casually, “Jin Yang just wants to take revenge on me. He doesn’t really love you and the children.”\n“You don’t know, do you? There’s another woman in my brother’s heart.”\n“That woman once lived in the official residence for a few years…”\nThese words echoed in Qiu Tong’s ears. She was slicing potatoes with a knife and she gave a slight jerk. The sharp blade grazed her skin, causing blood to ooze out.\nShe recalled the few times when Jin Yang was unconscious and severely injured. He had subconsciously muttered some words. Her heart tightened with frustration at the memory.\nSeeing that his goal had been achieved, Song Yan returned to the living room and sat beside Qiu Xingyu, who was playing with her toys.\n“Little Yu, I’m your real father.”\nSong Yan tucked a strand of her hair behind her ear. His tone was alluring.\nQiu Xingyu was so frightened that she widened her eyes and wanted to dodge. Jin Yang threw a punch. Song Yan tilted his head and used his finger to wipe the blood from the corner of his mouth.\n“Stay away from them. If I hear those words coming out of your mouth again, I will…”\nSong Yan suddenly stood up and stared straight at Jin Yang. He asked menacingly, “You will what?”\n“You will banish me?”\nSong Yan heard footsteps behind him and quickly wiped his earlier expression from his face. He took the initiative to help Qiu Tong carry the food over. “Don’t be so nervous. I just wanted to have lunch.” His thin lips curled up, and his eyes were filled with innocence, as if he had become a completely different person.\n…\nIn an abandoned factory on the outskirts of the city, Yu Ge was tied to a cement pillar. He was covered in injuries and appeared to be on his final breath.\nDina sat on the cement block. He stared at Yu Ge with a sallow and haggard face. He coughed out two mouthfuls of blood. “Trash!”\n“It has been so many days but you failed to bring Qiu Tong over! What’s the use of keeping you?”\n“You are just a burden!”\nDina’s subordinate understood the hint in his eyes. He swung a barbed whip at Yu Ge. Yu Ge cried out in pain as his flesh split open. He begged for mercy. “Give me one more chance. I will definitely be able to bring her to you!”\n“No need.”\nDina stood up and walked to the mirror. He rubbed his chin with a fierce look. “I don’t have time to wait anymore!”",

      "content": "Chapter 212: Kidnapping Qiu Tong\nQiu Tong was sitting on a park bench outside the villa.\nTwo stray cats rubbed against her ankles and jumped onto Qiu Tong’s lap coquettishly, waiting for her to gently scratch their bellies.\nTheir adorable expressions gradually relaxed Qiu Tong, and a smile appeared on her face.\nThinking of Jin Yang and Song Yan, who were always arguing with each other at home, Qiu Tong felt a headache coming on. She even regretted making the decision to marry Jin Yang.\nNow, not only was the matter not resolved, it had become even more troublesome than before.\nIt was getting late. Qiu Tong had brought two cans of cat food from the convenience store and she placed them on the ground. She was about to go home when she saw a bent old man in front of her. He stood beside the trash can and rummaged through it with difficulty. In the next second, he suddenly held his head and swayed as he fell to the side of the road.\nQiu Tong frowned and rushed to his side to help him. “Are you alright?”\n“Thank you.”\n“You’re so kind-hearted!”\nThe old man coughed twice and grabbed Qiu Tong’s wrist, wanting to stand up. He kept thanking her.\nA gust of wind blew past. The plastic bag that the old man had in his hands was blown away. It was empty.\nQiu Tong sensed that he was holding her wrist a bit too tightly and immediately became wary.\nJust as she was about to dodge and break free, the old man raised his right hand and took out a syringe. He jabbed it into the back of Qiu Tong’s neck.\nThe old man raised his head, revealing a pair of familiar and shrewd eyes. He pulled off his mask. “Kind-hearted people often bring trouble upon themselves. It has been a long time since we last met, Qiu Tong. You’re still as stupid and gullible as ever!”\nIt was Dina! Qiu Tong held her breath, wanting to control the speed at which the chemicals flowed through her body. However, her eyelids gradually closed and she fainted.\nDina pressed a button on his communication device and an ordinary-looking van drove over from afar.\nDina’s men helped carry Qiu Tong to the car and quickly left.\nTwo hours later, Qiu Tong woke up groggily.\nIn front of them was a dilapidated abandoned factory. Dina’s men from the terrorist organization were sitting by the bonfire, drinking and eating.\nQiu Tong was tied to a stone pillar in the corner. She tried to struggle but realized that the hemp rope was tightly bound and there was no room for her to move.\nDina realized what she was doing and squatted in front of her with a dagger in his hand. The cold blade lifted her chin and slowly rubbed against her carotid artery.\n“We finally meet again.”\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes and realized that Yu Ge was sitting in the distance covered in blood. Realization dawned upon her. “Did you do all that?”\n“Yes.”\nDina admitted as he stood up. He took out two hospital photos and handed them to Qiu Tong.\nHe pointed at the shadow that had almost spread to the entire lung. “I have lung cancer, but I don’t want to die! I want to find a way to survive…”\n“I know you have a solution! You can help me, right?”\nDina’s eyes were bloodshot. In the face of death, he had become very agitated and extreme.\nQiu Tong understood his request and regained her composure. After all, Dina needed her to recover and he would not let her die.\n“Is this how you treat me when you want my help?”\nA mocking smile appeared on Qiu Tong’s lips as she raised her head to question him. Yu Ge was bandaging his wounds and could not control his resentment when he saw her. He dragged his battered body over to Dina. “Boss, please give me another chance to interrogate her on your behalf!”\n“I know Qiu Tong very well. I know how to make her yield and make her willing to treat you.”\nYu Ge’s eyes shone with excitement. Dina’s body needed rest after this ordeal. He waved his hand and gestured for Yu Ge to do it.\nYu Ge revealed a fervent and wicked smile. He rubbed his hands together and approached Qiu Tong with a soft whip in his hand. “You didn’t expect your life to fall into my hands one day, right? Why aren’t you smiling anymore? Are you still hoping that someone will come and save you?”\n“Stop dreaming! Accept your fate!”\nYu Ge raised his hand and slapped Qiu Tong hard on the face. Qiu Tong looked up at him, her eyes filled with sympathy and pity. “You are always a dog for others no matter where you go. Dina needs me, but he doesn’t need you…”\n“Between you and me, who do you think he will choose?”\n“Why don’t we give it a try?”\nQiu Tong licked the blood from the corner of her lips. The smell of blood filled the air. She smiled brightly, her eyes flashing with disdain.\nYu Ge was a little flustered. He wanted to cover Qiu Tong’s mouth, but she rushed to shout, “Dina! I can save you…”\n“Come here. Let’s talk terms.”\nJoy flashed across Dina’s face. He rushed over to Qiu Tong and pushed Yu Ge away. “What do you want?”\n“Let me go and prepare a laboratory counter for me to develop the medicine.”\n“Also, tie him up so that I can use him as a lab rat to test the medicine for you!”\nQiu Tong’s finger landed on Yu Ge. Yu Ge trembled in fear and shook his head, sensing the danger. “Don’t listen to her nonsense!”\n“Boss, she’s stalling for time. She wants to wait for her companions to save her!”\nYu Ge knelt on the ground, but Qiu Tong was in no rush. She looked straight at Dina, her eyes filled with confidence.",

      "content": "Chapter 213: Revenge\n“Lung cancer is a disease that is impossible to cure. I have a way to concoct a medicine, but I cannot guarantee its effect.”\n“Various side effects will inevitably occur during the process. Some of which might be life-threatening.”\n“I am sure you don’t want to gamble with your life, right?”\nQiu Tong convinced Dina with just a few words. She raised her eyebrows and stared at Yu Ge. “I have some past grudges with him. I can vent my anger in this way.”\n“You don’t mind, do you?”\nDina narrowed his eyes and gestured for his subordinates to untie Qiu Tong.\nYu Ge sensed that something was wrong. He hurriedly got up and wanted to escape, but he had only taken two steps when he was grabbed by Dina.\nDina’s men tied him to the stone pillar naked. Qiu Tong rubbed her wrists and walked to the counter with a smile when she saw Yu Ge’s pitiful look. Dina prepared all kinds of chemicals according to her request. His eyes were filled with suspicion as he held the pistol and pressed it against Qiu Tong’s temple.\n“You better not play any tricks. As long as you can cure me, I promise to release you.”\n“I’ll even give you a considerable sum of money.”\nAs Qiu Tong swirled a vial, she recalled the composition of a poison that could numb the nerves. She slowly concocted it.\nShe turned to look at Dina. “Of course,” she said, a smile lighting up her features. “I’ll do my best.”\n…\nIn the villa, Jin Yang played a game with Qiu Xingyu. He looked at the clock hanging on the wall uneasily.\nIt had been nearly three hours since Qiu Tong left the house to throw the trash. At first, Jin Yang thought that she was hiding outside to have some peace and quiet, but now, something felt not quite right.\nHe calmed the children and said to Song Yan, “Take care of them…”\nJin Yang was wearing a windbreaker as he searched for Qiu Tong. He cupped his hand around his mouth and shouted Qiu Tong’s name, but there was no response.\nTwo stray cats by a bench meowed when they saw him.\nJin Yang looked at the two cans of cat food and realized that there were signs of an unfamiliar car tire passing near the trash can. He immediately instructed his bodyguards to check the surveillance cameras nearby. When he saw the image of Qiu Tong being kidnapped, he said in a low and murderous voice, “Find this car!”\n“Yes.”\nThe presidential guards immediately left. Jin Yang returned home with a dark expression. Song Yan realized that he was in a bad mood. “What’s wrong?”\n“Qiu Tong has been kidnapped.”\nJin Yang walked to a corner of the kitchen with him and whispered to him.\nSong Yan frowned and asked about the situation. Jin Yang sent him the surveillance footage. At this moment, the two of them were on the same side and cooperated well.\n“This car has a dummy license plate. There’s no way to find and track it based on the license plate number.”\n“If your presidential guards contact the relevant departments about this, they will cause too much commotion. People at the capital will be alerted. Leave this to me…”\n“I’ll find her.”\nWith that, Song Yan rushed out the door. Jin Yang looked at his back profile, his heart filled with indescribable complicated emotions.\nQiu Xingyuan heard the loud sound of the door closing. He looked at Jin Yang’s slightly grave expression and asked in confusion, “What’s wrong?”\nJin Yang forced a smile and sat beside them. He tried his best to speak in a gentle tone, “We had some conflict. Don’t worry.”\n…\nIn the abandoned factory, Qiu Tong shook the pink test tube and used the syringe to extract the liquid. She slowly walked towards Yu Ge.\nYu Ge was so afraid that he twisted his body. He resisted and tried to break free. The skin on his wrist was grinded by a rough hemp rope, cutting into his flesh.\nDina ordered his subordinates to hold him down and let Qiu Tong inject the liquid into Yu Ge’s body.\nA few seconds later, Yu Ge collapsed to the ground, twitching. He rolled his eyes and foamed at the mouth. His tragic appearance frightened the surrounding people.\nDina pointed his pistol at Qiu Tong. “You tricked me!”\n“Maybe there’s a problem with the ratio. I’ll continue…”\nQiu Tong returned to the counter and frowned secretly. She wondered why Jin Yang and Song Yan had not found this place yet. Would she really have to use her supernatural power to save Dina? At the thought of this, Qiu Tong’s hands trembled and she spilled two drops of the medicine on the ground.\nWhite smoke rose from the cement ground. Dina ordered his subordinates to subdue Qiu Tong.\n“Tell me the formula, I’ll get someone else to concoct it!”\nDina was completely restraining Qiu Tong’s freedom now. She had no choice but to fabricate a formula and try to stall for time.\n…\nBeep beep—\nThere was a text message on Jin Yang’s phone. It was from Song Yan. “Found her.”\nHe immediately left the villa and arranged for Ke Le and the other mercenaries to take care of the children. They drove to the abandoned factory.\nThe guards who had gone in advance to scout the situation first reported the status quo to them. “More than 20 terrorists led by Dina are in the factory. They rotate the guards outside every 10 minutes. It’s difficult to approach.”\n“We have no way of figuring out the terrain inside and where Miss Qiu is.”\n“If we attack rashly, we might accidentally injure her. Mr. President, please instruct us…”\nSong Yan looked at the sky and said in an extremely cold voice, “If we delay any longer, it will probably be even more difficult when it gets dark!”",

      "content": "Chapter 214: Factory Explosion\nWith an anxious expression, Jin Yang climbed to an advantageous spot with his bare hands. He took out a short-range telescope and surveyed the location. He discovered that there were two windows on the dilapidated red brick wall. He recalled the light signal Qiu Tong had used at home when she was playing with the children. He turned around and asked the guard beside him, “Do you have a mirror?”\nThe guard was taken aback but he quickly found a square mirror.\nJin Yang slowly adjusted the angle of the light. He focused the light on the window and used Qiu Tong’s secret signal to communicate with the interior…\nQiu Tong leaned against the stone pillar and was elated to see the shimmering light on the opposite wall.\nShe understood the message Jin Yang was trying to convey. She looked at Dina and said loudly, “I want to go to the bathroom!”\nDina was focused on pressing his subordinate to concoct the medicine according to Qiu Tong’s formula. He waved his hand and gestured for his other men to bring her to a corner.\nQiu Tong’s hands were tied with hemp rope. She hid in a safe corner and quietly counted down.\nThree, two, one… with the violent sounds of explosives being thrown in, two groups of presidential guards attacked from outside.\nThe terrorists dodged in panic. Dina was the first to react. He rushed to Qiu Tong’s side and grabbed her neck. He said ruthlessly, “I underestimated you! I didn’t expect you to be able to contact the outside world and find us here!”\n“If you surrender now, I can plead with them to spare your life.”\nQiu Tong saw Dina’s bloodshot eyes. He was now forced to the brink of death and had a desperate do-or-die attitude. She hurriedly tried to calm him.\nDina snorted.\n“Surrender? And return to prison? I have lung cancer and won’t be able to live for long!”\n“The doctors in the prison are all useless. Since I’m going to die, why don’t I drag a few people along with me!”\nDina lowered his head and pointed the gun at Qiu Tong. He chuckled and whispered into her ear, “With you accompanying me to my grave, I won’t be lonely on the road to hell!”\n“Qiu Tong!”\nJin Yang barged in with his team. He shouted loudly when he saw Dina and Qiu Tong.\nQiu Tong met his gaze and stepped down firmly on Dina’s foot. She dodged to the side.\nDina raised his hand to grab her, but Jin Yang shot him in the elbow and ankle.\nBang!\nDina fell to the ground. Jin Yang ran to Qiu Tong’s side and helped her up. He asked anxiously, “Are you alright?”\nQiu Tong nodded. The terrorists were fighting for their lives. The situation in the abandoned factory was dangerous.\nThe presidential guards managed to subdue most of the terrorists. Jin Yang indicated that they could escort the prisoners back. As Qiu Tong had sprained her ankle while escaping, she could only slowly walk towards the door with Jin Yang’s help. “Where are the children?”\nJin Yang comforted her softly. “Ke Le is taking care of them. They don’t know what happened here.”\nQiu Tong heaved a sigh of relief, but she suddenly heard the sound of a ring being pulled from behind. She stopped in her tracks and turned around. She saw Dina standing in the corner, holding two hand grenades and two boxes of explosives beside his feet. “Since I am going to die, you are all coming along with me!”\nJin Yang didn’t expect there to be so many weapons and equipment here. They were still 20 meters away from the door and it would be too late to escape.\n“Get down!”\nJin Yang raised his hand and covered Qiu Tong’s head, before enveloping her in his arms.\nBoom—\nFlames surged several meters high in the abandoned factory. The red brick wall collapsed, turning the scene into a sea of fire.\nQiu Tong felt a warm liquid flowing down her forehead. She opened her eyes in a daze and saw Jin Yang smiling at her. He said softly, “As long as you’re safe!”\nQiu Tong felt her chest tighten, and the smell of gunpowder filled the air.\nShe saw many guards running towards them through the flames. “President…”\nJin Yang held her hand tightly and muttered, “You’re not allowed to die!”\nQiu Tong fainted.\nQiu Tong seemed to have had a very long dream. In the dream, there was a blurry figure holding her hand, but she could not see that person’s face.\nThere were the sounds of children crying around her. Qiu Tong felt as if there were two beams of light swaying in front of her eyes, dazzling and harsh.\n“Can the patient hear me? Follow the light and move your eyes.”\nQiu Tong gradually woke up and saw the white coat and the children standing by the bed, as well as Song Yan.\nShe wanted to speak, but she felt a sharp pain in her throat, as if countless hands were tearing at her vocal cords.\nThe doctor turned to Song Yan and said, “The patient’s life is not in danger. She just needs to rest well.”\nSong Yan nodded and sent him off. Qiu Xingyu rushed to the bed and held Qiu Tong’s hand with red eyes. “Mommy, is it very painful? Don’t do such dangerous things anymore, okay?”\nQiu Xingqiao wiped his snot with the back of his hand and tugged at Little Yu’s hand. “Sister, you are pressing down on her IV line.”\nQiu Tong raised her hand and rubbed the top of Little Yu’s head with a comforting smile.\nHer gaze landed on Song Yan as she asked slowly, “What about him?”",

      "content": "Chapter 215: Applying Ointment\nThe atmosphere in the ward became heavy and silent because of Qiu Tong’s question.\nSong Yan leaned against the door frame and shook his head with one hand in his pocket. He did not answer.\nQiu Xingyu pursed her lips and the tears that she had just suppressed flowed down again. She said in a daze, “Uncle Jin Yang wanted to save Mommy and he protected you with his body. The explosion was especially intense, and when he arrived at the hospital…”\nQiu Tong gripped the bedsheet nervously, but Little Yu couldn’t continue. She hugged Qiu Xingqiao and wailed.\nEveryone’s expression seemed to say that Jin Yang had died to save her.\nQiu Tong gave a sad chuckle. Images of her interacting with Jin Yang flashed across her mind. She clearly remembered Jin Yang’s last words to her in the fire.\nShe pulled out her IV and blood flowed out.\nQiu Tong ignored the pain and got up. Song Yan and Qiu Xingyuan wanted to grab her. They looked like they were saying something.\nBut to Qiu Tong, they appeared to be moving in slow motion. The world seemed to have become static. She staggered to the door of the ward.\nEven if Jin Yang died, she had to see him one last time…\nQiu Tong was about to step through the door when she tripped over the threshold and fell.\nShrill cries rang out from behind her. Song Yan raised his hand, wanting to grab her elbow.\nIn the next second, Qiu Tong fell into a familiar embrace. She slowly raised her head and saw Jin Yang’s face in the light. She instinctively lifted her hand to caress his statue-like face, muttering softly, “You’re not dead?”\n“Wonderful.”\nJin Yang looked at Song Yan and the children in confusion. He held Qiu Tong’s waist firmly so that she could stand firm.\nSong Yan shrugged and glanced to the side indifferently. He grabbed an orange from a fruit basket on the bedside table and said, “She wanted to find you. She probably thought you died trying to save her. Now she thinks she saw a ghost.” Song Yan’s tone was harsh, but Jin Yang understood the situation.\nHe looked down gently at Qiu Tong and pointed at the bandage wrapped around his shoulder. “I’m fine.”\n“Shards from the explosion pierced my arms and back. It was a little tricky, but not life-threatening.”\n“But if you keep pressing on my wound like this, I’m afraid it will worsen my pain and I will take longer to recover.”\nJin Yang was trying to make a joke. Qiu Tong slowly regained her senses and everything around her finally returned to normal.\nShe frowned and glared at the children, blaming them for their exaggerated descriptions.\nQiu Xingyuan shielded Little Yu behind him and defended her, “You didn’t finish listening to Little Yu’s whole story. You were too agitated.”\nThe presidential guards wiped out the terrorist organization led by Dina. Yu Ge and the rest were imprisoned again.\nQiu Tong was unwilling to stay in the hospital to recuperate, so she returned to the villa with Jin Yang.\nAt night, Qiu Tong was a little worried about Jin Yang’s injuries. She quietly went to the guest room next door and knocked.\nThe door opened. Jin Yang had a towel wrapped around his waist, revealing his well-defined abs. He wiped his wet hair and did not look embarrassed or surprised. Instead, he pointed at the ointment on the tray. “Can you help me?”\n“I can’t apply medicine to the wound behind.”\nJin Yang turned around. Qiu Tong saw the wound on his back. The bomb fragments had pierced his body. Although the wound had been cleaned, it was still terrible to look at.\nQiu Tong nodded and walked to his side. Jin Yang sat with his back facing her in front of the mirror. The atmosphere in the room was thick and ambiguous.\n“Gasp…”\nQiu Tong dabbed some cold ointment on Jin Yang’s back. He gasped and his muscles tensed.\nJin Yang endured the pain with all his might, veins bulging on his arms.\nQiu Tong suddenly felt a little hot and uneasy. She tried her best to focus on putting ointment on Jin Yang’s wound.\nAfter applying the medicine on Jin Yang’s wound, Qiu Tong slowly squatted down, her gaze landing on the “tent” that had popped up under his towel.\nJin Yang was a little embarrassed. He said in a hoarse voice, “I can do the rest myself.”\n“Let me help you.”\nQiu Tong’s ears were flushed red as she gripped the ointment.\nJin Yang tried to take the medicine from her hand. In the scuffle, they ended up dislodging the towel around his waist…\nQiu Tong saw Jin Yang’s erection and panicked. She wanted to leave, but her toes bumped into the corner of the closet.\nThe excruciating pain made her lose her balance and she fell onto Jin Yang’s lap.\nQiu Tong’s perky butt landed on his burning erection. She wanted to stand up, but her hips rubbed against it. Jin Yang’s eyes darkened as he hugged her waist and pressed her down slightly. His erection rubbed against her butt cheeks. “In the hospital, you were very worried about me, right?”\nJin Yang whispered hoarsely into her ear, causing Qiu Tong to tremble.\n“You have me in your heart, right?”\nJin Yang opened his mouth to suck on Qiu Tong’s ear lobe. He used his slender fingers to pick up the loose hair at Qiu Tong’s temple and tucked it behind her ear.\nQiu Tong did not resist his touch. Sensing the change in her body language, Jin Yang picked her up and threw her onto the bed, before leaning over to press her down!",

      "content": "Chapter 216: Sudden Return To The Capital\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nOn the soft bed in the bedroom, the bodies of a man and a woman were entangled together, both breathing out hot air.\nJin Yang held her neck and ran his fingers through her hair. He gently held the back of Qiu Tong’s head and kissed her lips.\nHe slowly unbuttoned her shirt, his palm pressed against her chest as his thin lips sucked on her collarbone.\nQiu Tong found it ticklish and tried to move away, but Jin Yang didn’t give her a chance.\nJin Yang’s kiss gradually moved down, his short and messy hair brushing against her chest.\nIn the quiet atmosphere, there was only the sound of their panting as they teased each other.\nJin Yang took a deep breath and tried his best to suppress the urge to grope her hard. He pulled Qiu Tong’s shirt down and buried his face in her neck. “Can I?” But even as he waited for Qiu Tong to agree, his hand was already naughtily reaching into her skirt. He found her sweet spot and pressed it with his fingertips.\nQiu Tong frowned as she somewhat lost control of her emotions from his teasing.\nShe could feel her body heat up and turn soft and pliable.\nQiu Tong had no energy to think and could only nod in agreement.\nWith permission, Jin Yang kissed her soft chest, pressing his palm against her lower abdomen and rubbing her buttocks.\nTaking advantage of Qiu Tong’s daze, he went straight for her sweet spot.\nQiu Tong could no longer think. She moaned coquettishly.\nJin Yang’s voice was hoarse and his eyes were filled with affection as he lifted her legs and wrapped them around his waist. “Shh, lower your voice.”\n“You are pressing in so tight. Let go a little. I can’t move.”\nJin Yang felt his scalp go numb. Qiu Tong trembled and gripped his head as if she wanted to squeeze him dry.\nQiu Tong gasped. She grunted as she grabbed Jin Yang’s back muscles, leaving scratches on his body.\n“Can you slow down?”\nQiu Tong complained coquettishly. Jin Yang had no intention of stopping, he planned to make her go limp.\nEvery time he ventured into the deepest part of her body, Jin Yang would deliberately rub against her.\nFinally, Qiu Tong’s panting became hoarse and short and she squeezed her legs tightly together. The two of them were on cloud nine as their bodies were drenched in sweat.\n…\nThe next morning, Qiu Tong woke up aching and exhausted. She saw the man beside her pillow. She picked up the clothes that were scattered all over the floor and quietly left the bedroom.\nQiu Xingyu and Qiu Xingyuan were going to Qiu Tong’s room to look for her, but they bumped into Qiu Tong coming out of the guest room.\nQiu Tong awkwardly used a towel to cover the hickey on her neck.\nQiu Xingyu looked up at her in confusion. “Why did Mommy come out of Uncle Jin Yang’s room?”\n“Are there mosquitoes at home? Mommy seems to have been bitten. I’ll find you some ointment!”\nLittle Yu turned around and ran to the living room to rummage through the first aid kit.\nQiu Tong did not know how to explain. Qiu Xingyuan frowned in understanding and walked to Little Yu’s side. “It’s not a mosquito.”\nQiu Xingyu stood up in a daze. She stared at Jin Yang’s room for a long time before suddenly tugging at Qiu Xingyuan’s sleeve excitedly.\n“Elder Brother, will Uncle Jin Yang really become our father in the future?”\n“We’ll have a Daddy from now on, right?”\nQiu Xingyuan narrowed his eyes and did not answer. He had seen Jin Yang’s care and concern for Qiu Tong in the hospital, but he still could not be sure if he was sincere.\nThis guy still had a long probation period ahead of him!\nIn the bedroom, Jin Yang opened his eyes the moment Qiu Tong left. He used his finger to poke his forehead and sat up.\nSunlight scattered across the bed and floor. He closed his eyes in silence, recalling the dream from last night.\nIn his dream, there seemed to be a woman beside him. They were in love.\nThis dream, which had troubled him for many years, was always very realistic. But Jin Yang never managed to see the woman’s face clearly! He recalled Qiu Tong’s appearance under his body last night and he felt very conflicted.\nThe phone on the bedside table buzzed, breaking Jin Yang’s train of thought and his gloominess.\nWhen Shao An heard that the call was connected, he was so excited that he nearly knelt down. He said bluntly, “Sir, the old Mr. Jin has already called countless times to urge you to return to your old home. I can’t make any more excuses for you.”\n“He’s already suspicious. If you still can’t return this weekend, I’m afraid…”\nShao An informed Jin Yang of the worst-case scenario. Jin Yang was silent for a moment. “Help me book the earliest flight back to the capital.”\nAfter hanging up the phone, Jin Yang picked up his shirt from the ground and stood in front of the full-length mirror. He looked at the scratches on his back and chest, before frowning. Qiu Tong knocked on the door and said, “It’s time for breakfast.”\nJin Yang opened the door and locked it before walking into the dining room.\nQiu Xingyuan held his bowl and observed the subtle tension between the two of them. He narrowed his eyes and deliberately probed, “Why didn’t Uncle Song come today? Mommy knows that he doesn’t eat ginger and made a special bowl for him.”\nJin Yang looked at the rice pot in the kitchen with a normal expression.\nQiu Tong frowned, confused by Qiu Xingyuan’s sudden words.\nJin Yang picked up his food and said softly, “I’m going back to the capital.”\n“Call me if you encounter anything…”\nJin Yang passed her his private number that could be reached 24/7. Qiu Tong suddenly felt that the food in her mouth had become tasteless.. But she still nodded and accepted it.",

      "content": "Chapter 217: Disparity In Status\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nAt noon, in the garden of the villa.\nQiu Xingyuan, Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu were building a wooden castle in the sandbox.\nQiu Tong sat on the bench and watched them quietly. From time to time, she would glance down at her phone.\nShe pressed the bright screen and opened her chat with Jin Yang. Her fingertips touched the screen and she typed a line of text. She didn’t press the send button for a long time. When the screen turned dark, Qiu Tong saw her own face reflected on the dark screen. She lowered her eyes.\nSong Yan came from the villa next door. He crossed his arms lazily and leaned against the tree, watching her movements.\n“With Jin Yang’s status, he cannot be with a civilian.”\n“As the president, he has no say in choosing his wife and future partner.”\n“I advise you to clear your mind of such thoughts as soon as possible. I can totally take care of the children and you. I can give you the same life, and perhaps even more warmth…”\nSong Yan’s teasing words allowed Qiu Tong to regain her senses. She kept her phone and returned to her room.\nOutside the house, Song Yan squatted beside Little Yu in an attempt to form a good relationship with the children. However, Qiu Xingyuan held his sister’s hand and left with her, as if he was avoiding a bad person.\nSong Yan touched the tip of his nose and smiled. He self-deprecatingly finished building the half-completed sandcastle that Qiu Xingyuan and Little Yu had abandoned.\n…\nMeanwhile, Lin Shan was standing in front of Shu Xian’s house. She had pressed the doorbell countless times, but no one answered.\nIt was only when the surrounding neighbors complained about the disturbance that Shu Xian’s nanny pushed open the door. She looked at Lin Shan with a troubled expression and said, “Miss Lin, Mr. Shu is not at home.”\n“He’s out on a business trip because of the factory. If you want to see him, come back in a few days!”\nLin Shan refused to believe it and wanted to charge in, but the burly nanny blocked the entrance.\n“Let me in, Shu Xian must be inside! Why is he hiding from me? Qiu Tong was behind the factory incident. She colluded with Mayor Shen to snatch all the credit for exterminating locusts. It has nothing to do with me!”\nLin Shan had not seen Shu Xian for several days. Many of her bank cards and credit cards had been blocked.\nThis meant that Shu Xian was angry with her and wanted to abandon her.\nLin Shan tugged at the nanny as if she was clutching at a life-saving straw. She clasped her hands together and pointed inside. “Let me in. I can explain everything to Shu Xian! When we reconcile, I will think of a way to repay you…”\nThe nanny’s expression changed several times. She looked back at the spiral staircase in the villa and shook her head.\n“Miss Lin, if you want to look for Mr. Shu, you should call him. He will see that you called.”\nThe nanny pushed Lin Shan hard and closed the door with a bang.\nLin Shan fell down outside the door. Her clothes were tattered and her eyes were filled with hatred as she muttered, “Qiu Tong, it’s all because of you!”\n“You’re the one who turned me into this. Even if I die, I’ll drag you along!”\nLin Shan gritted her teeth and looked up at the window on the second floor of the villa. She took out her phone and dialed a voice message. “Shu Xian, I know you’re unwilling to accept this outcome. We still have a chance of connecting to the government. That piece of land has not been distributed yet!”\n“I know that Qiu Tong has a protective medicine in her hands. As long as you can get it and place it on the factory’s assembly line…”\n“Not only can we earn money, we will also be rewarded by the government.”\n“Contact me if you’re interested.”\nWith her bag slung over her shoulder, Lin Shan left the villa district with determined steps. She was certain that Shu Xian would definitely contact her.\nAfter all, a businessman’s nature was to seek profits!\nLate at night, a private plane landed. Shao An personally drove over to welcome Jin Yang.\nTears welled up in his eyes when he saw Jin Yang walking down the staircase.\nJin Yang frowned in disdain at his dramatic behavior and kept a distance from him. “How’s the situation in the official residence?”\nShao An straightened his back and saluted. He held the steering wheel and reported to him.\nJin Yang sat in the back seat and looked at his phone. He had not received any messages. He felt an indescribable sense of loss. He hesitantly typed a few lines, deleted and then wrote without sending. Shao An looked at his actions through the rearview mirror and reminded him, “Old Mr. Jin has been sending people to the official residence very frequently in recent times. I used the excuse that it’s an inconvenient time for you to reject their requests to meet you.”\n“Well done.”\nJin Yang nodded. Shao An asked hesitantly, “Do you want to return to your old home?”\nJin Yang narrowed his eyes and leaned back in the backseat tiredly. He shook his head and refused, “No, let’s return to the official residence.”\nThere were too many things in the capital that he needed to settle and resolve. Meanwhile, that text message was ultimately stored in his draft box and not sent out.\nUnder the full moon, Qiu Tong and Jin Yang missed each other, but no one dared to take that first step.\nJin Yang returned to the official residence and the butler came out to welcome him. He took Jin Yang’s jacket and watched him walk to the second floor.\nAs Jin Yang’s hand gripped the stair’s handrail, he stopped in his tracks as if he had remembered something.\nHe turned to the butler and asked, “Do you… remember a woman who often wears a white dress?”\nThe butler was stunned and did not answer.\nJin Yang frowned and waved his hand. “Forget it. Pretend I didn’t ask..”",

She reached out a finger smeared with bright red carapace oil and gently lifted Shu Xian’s chin, her gaze seductive.\nAfter the matter was settled, Shu Xian lit his cigar and leaned against the headboard. Lin Shan took the initiative to lean against his chest, her fingertips drawing circles on his chest.\n“How did you know that Qiu Tong has a protective medicine?”\nShu Xian’s eyes glinted as he patted Lin Shan’s butt and asked. He had obviously heard that message and felt that she was useful.\nLin Shan understood Shu Xian’s thoughts and replied sweetly, “I overheard it.”\n“The children of the Qiu family are all very powerful people. Her eldest son specializes in developing drugs. The locust pesticide was an example.”\n“But Qiu Tong has a grudge against us. It’s impossible to buy the protective medicine formula from her.”\nLin Shan narrowed her eyes, her tone provocative. Her palm slowly slid down and landed between Shu Xian’s legs.\n“Why don’t you arrange for some men to go to the kindergarten and hold the children? As long as we can hold them, Qiu Tong will definitely be obedient.”\n“When the time comes, our factory can be upgraded and replaced. We will definitely be able to earn more money!”\nLin Shan said softly with her red lips. She climbed onto Shu Xian’s body and pressed her soft chest against him.\nShu Xian’s eyes were filled with lust. He pressed Lin Shan down and rode her, imagining the beautiful future.\n…\nIn the kindergarten, Qiu Xingyuan, Qiu Xingyuan, Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu carried their school bags as they bid farewell to the teacher.\nKe Le followed closely behind them, keeping in mind his status as a bodyguard.\nLittle Yu saw her friends at the playground and she ran over to play with them. Ke Le sped up to keep near.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao sat on a bench under the shade of a tree. Qiu Xingyuan narrowed his eyes and pretended to rummage through the textbooks in his school bag. He used his peripheral vision to glance at the few sneaky figures hiding behind the trees. “Someone is following us.”\n“Ah? Where?”\nQiu Xingqiao was rash and wanted to look around. Qiu Xingyuan quickly kicked his calf to warn him. “Nine o’clock direction. Don’t let them realize that we spotted them! They have been following us since the entrance of the kindergarten. They must have planned this.”\nQiu Xingqiao thought of the recent television news that reported on child trafficking. He frowned and straightened his back, his expression tense and stiff.\n“Could it be human traffickers?”\nQiu Xingyuan shook his head. He hid a mirror in the middle of the page and carefully adjusted the angle until he could clearly see the faces of the two people.\n“If it’s a trafficking gang, they will definitely target a child who’s alone.”\n“Uncle Ke Le is always by our side. They have no chance to attack. The only possibility is that they are here specifically for us!”\nQiu Xingqiao recalled the kidnapping incident at the hospital. He clenched his fists and asked, “What should we do?”\nQiu Xingyuan looked at Ke Le and gestured with his finger at him.\nKe Le was an elite mercenary. He immediately understood Qiu Xingyuan’s intentions.\nHe picked up Little Yu and left the playground.\nQiu Xingyuan slowly tidied his school bag, before taking out two bags of powder and secretly stuffing them into Qiu Xingqiao’s palm. He deliberately put on an anxious expression and raised his voice to a high pitch. “Let’s go home quickly!”\nWhen the gangsters hired by Shu Xian saw that the two of them were alone, they looked at each other with joy on their faces.\nThey hurriedly chased after Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao. They walked to a quiet and deserted alley. The gangsters wanted to make a move as they saw the favorable terrain.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao stopped in their tracks in unison. They turned around and sprinkled powder on the two people who were approaching.\nThe gangsters were not prepared. As the powder drifted into their eyes, they felt a sharp pain. Their tears kept flowing as they blindly tried to catch the children.\nQiu Xingqiao kept silent. Taking advantage of the situation, he lifted his leg and kicked the gangster’s lower abdomen.\nQiu Xingyuan took out a hemp rope and wanted to tie the gangster up.\nKe Le ran over from afar, wanting to control the two of them. Seeing that the situation was not looking good, the gangsters could not be bothered to capture the children anymore. They fled in a panic. Ke Le wanted to chase after them, but Qiu Xingyuan raised his hand to stop him. “They are very weak. They are not the same group of people who tried to kidnap us last time.”\n“Little Yu is frightened. Let’s go back.”\nKe Le nodded and looked at Qiu Xingyu’s confused expression. He hugged her.\nQiu Xingyuan looked in the direction where the gangsters had fled, confusion and suspicion flashing across his eyes.\nAfter returning to the villa, Qiu Tong heard from them about the danger they encountered today. She instantly became very anxious.\nShe thought of all the people who could be responsible, even Song Yan, but eventually eliminated the possibility that it was any of them.\n“Mommy, it’s alright. We can protect ourselves!”\nQiu Xingqiao saw that she was frowning and comforted her. Qiu Xingyuan’s expression was awkward. He pursed his thin lips and said in a very low voice, “We’re not children. You don’t have to worry about us all the time. You should think about your own matters.”\nQiu Tong was surprised. She did not think that she would ever hear Qiu Xingyuan nagging at her…",

      "content": "Chapter 219: Dark Web Mission Accepted\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nAs night fell, the lights in the villa went out one by one. Only the lights in Qiu Tong’s room were still on.\nIn the dim light, Qiu Tong sat in front of the computer and pondered. The multiple abduction attempts on the children meant that their surroundings were not safe!\nShe picked up her phone and stared at the blank chat window for two seconds before slamming the phone onto the table.\nJin Yang and her only had a marriage of convenience.\nThe matters of the Qiu family had nothing to do with him. Qiu Tong reminded herself not to rely on him too much.\nQiu Xingyu had put a family photo carefully in a frame and placed it on the computer table.\nQiu Tong’s gaze landed on it. She picked it up and examined it. Her heart stirred.\nThe Qiu Rong in the photo frame was full of energy, while the Qiu Rong she saw in the prison some time ago was so worn out that the hair at his temples had turned white.\nThe warden had told her that she could spend money to reduce his sentence. For every five million dollars, she could reduce the sentence by a year!\nQiu Tong opened the Dark Web with furrowed brows. She selected suitable missions according to the remuneration. She was preparing to bring Qiu Rong back…\nThere were fake missions mixed into the real missions listed on the Dark Web. Qiu Tong saw that the highest-paying mission was to protect a person of interest over two weeks. The remuneration was three million! She was tempted and memorized the contact method. It was late into the night when she dialed the number.\nThe phone rang for nearly half a minute. Just as Qiu Tong thought that the mission was a fake, the call finally connected.\n“Hello? Are you hiring over the Dark Web?”\nQiu Tong asked coldly. On the other hand, the voice on the other end sounded abashed. “That’s right, I’ll give you the address. Come see me tomorrow!”\nThe other party hung up after saying that. Qiu Tong looked at the address she received with a blank expression.\nCould this be an especially dangerous mission?\nThe next morning, Qiu Tong prepared breakfast for the children and specially changed into a polished outfit.\nQiu Xingyuan came out of the bedroom in his pajamas and looked at her.\nQiu Xingyu rubbed her sleepy eyes and ran out. She threw herself into Qiu Tong’s arms coquettishly. Seeing her with light makeup on, which was a rare sight, she asked, “Is Mommy going out on a date? Is Uncle Jin Yang back?”\nJin Yang did have some ability. He could win over the hearts of the three Qiu siblings in such a short period of time!\nQiu Tong patted the top of Little Yu’s head and said casually, “Mommy is interviewing for a job to earn money to support the family!”\n“Little Yu, why don’t you wish Mommy the best for her interview! That I can successfully get this job…”\nWhen Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao heard that, they put down their chopsticks. Qiu Tong was surprised by their worried and heavy expressions.\nQiu Xingqiao said seriously, “We can lower our living standards.”\n“I’ve also developed a medicine recently. We should be able to earn some money from selling the patent. It can supplement the household income.”\nQiu Tong looked at the children’s worried expressions and tried to placate them. She got Ke Le to escort them to the kindergarten while she rushed over to the address, which was a research institute.\nShe reported her name to the security guard at the door and entered a heavily guarded laboratory building with a pass.\nThree million for a bodyguard?\nQiu Tong wondered if all university professors were so rich now.\nQiu Tong pushed the door open and saw an old professor sitting behind the desk. He was a little surprised to see that the applicant was a woman, but he still maintained his gentlemanly manner and pointed at the opposite seat, indicating for her to sit.\nThe old professor pushed up his glasses and introduced himself, “My surname is Dong.”\n“Recently, a group of foreign evil forces has infiltrated our city. They want to kidnap me. I have a bounty on my head so I went to the Dark Web to hire someone to protect me. You are a young lady and you look… I’m afraid you don’t meet my requirements. Sorry.”\nQiu Tong saw that he wanted to reject her and suggested, “You must have some bodyguards by your side now. Why don’t we have a competition before we decide?”\nProfessor Dong narrowed his eyes at her confident look and gestured for his bodyguards to spar with her.\nQiu Tong glanced at them from the corner of her eye and threw a quick punch, immediately knocking down one of them. Taking advantage of their surprise, she bent down and swept out one leg, bringing the rest of the bodyguards to the ground. The entire process only took three seconds.\nProfessor Dong was so shocked that his jaw dropped. He immediately signed the contract with Qiu Tong and paid half the fee as a deposit.\n“Why do the foreign evil forces want to kidnap you?”\nQiu Tong looked at Professor Dong’s troubled expression and shrugged. “You can choose not to tell me if you want to keep this a secret.”\nProfessor Dong had already signed a confidentiality agreement with Qiu Tong, so he naturally trusted her.\n“Come with me…”\nProfessor Dong gently rotated the pen holder on his desk. A secret door suddenly opened in the office.\nQiu Tong did not expect the university laboratory building to have such a mechanism. She followed Professor Dong in and saw several huge glass enclosures in the small space. They contained human specimens! On a laboratory counter, which was suffused with a blue light, were a few human organs and some white mice for testing.\nBoom—\nA loud noise came from a metal cage in the corner. Qiu Tong turned around and saw a faint glow radiating from the darkness.. It was a pair of green eyes!",

      "content": "Chapter 220: Accusation\nProfessor Dong turned on the light. The black chimpanzee in the cage slammed against the bars and growled.\nQiu Tong maintained her composure. Professor Dong seemed very satisfied with her reaction. “Have you heard of the human modification plan?”\nHe walked to a whiteboard filled with chemical equations and wiped away equations with an eraser.\nQiu Tong frowned and shook her head. “No.”\n“Simply put, we are looking for a way to raise the limits of mankind and create a perfect human being…”\nProfessor Dong’s eyes were filled with fervor as he spoke, but Qiu Tong did not understand.\nThe development of humans had to conform to the laws of nature. If they relied on drugs and external forces, it was very likely that they would create dangerous creatures. Qiu Tong thought of the post-apocalyptic zombie riot and swallowed the words that were about to come out of her mouth. She did not give her opinion.\nProfessor Dong flipped through a thick stack of documents. He held up two bottles of chemicals excitedly and drew them into a syringe.\n“The government had arranged for other scientists to lead this project, but they were incompetent and gave up halfway.”\n“I am taking over the research now. I’ve found a better approach. I don’t know who spread the news, but it attracted the attention of those evil foreign forces. They are also very interested in the human modification plan, so I need you to protect me!”\n“Until I successfully developed the formula…”\nProfessor Dong walked over to the chimpanzee with the syringe. He injected the liquid into its body. The chimpanzee’s face twisted as if it was in great pain.\nQiu Tong frowned and wanted to stop him, but then the chimpanzee quickly calmed down and looked at her with a sad expression.\nProfessor Dong took out a piece of paper and wrote down an equation and some numbers. He showed it to the chimpanzee who was able to choose the right answer!\n“Did you see that? This is my result!”\nProfessor Dong looked back at Qiu Tong with a fervent expression. Qiu Tong just nodded perfunctorily.\nIt was evening when the two of them came out of the secret room. Qiu Tong drove Professor Dong home.\nOutside the high-end apartment complex, Professor Dong suddenly heard rustling sounds from the bushes. He hurriedly pulled Qiu Tong to his side. Qiu Tong was annoyed by his actions, but she told herself that Professor Dong had already paid her deposit and she could not attack her employer.\nShe had no choice but to crawl along the bushes, only to see two stray cats hiding inside. “Don’t worry, I will ensure your safety.”\nProfessor Dong nodded and tidied his jacket before ringing the doorbell.\nQiu Tong watched him enter his house. She fiddled with her curly hair as she stood by the roadside to hail a taxi. She did not know that someone had secretly taken a picture of her and Professor Dong!\nLin Shan’s red lips curled up as she took the photo with her phone.\nAnyone who saw this would mistakenly think that Qiu Tong and Professor Dong were having an affair!\nShe wanted to see how Qiu Tong would explain herself this time!\nLin Shan had made up her mind to cause trouble for Qiu Tong. She found information about Professor Dong online and hired a private investigator to dig out his wife’s phone number. She then sent those photos over…\n“Qiu Tong, you always bring me trouble. Now, you can have a taste of what it is like to be accused of being a third party!”\n…\nIt was the weekend. Professor Dong sent a message to Qiu Tong last night saying that she would not be needed today.\nQiu Tong was glad to be free. She busied herself in the kitchen, wanting to cook up some nutritional delicacies for the three children.\nDing dong—\nThe doorbell rang. Qiu Xingyu put down her toy and ran over to open the door.\nA middle-aged woman wearing a heavy pearl necklace angrily pushed her aside and strode into the house!\nQiu Xingyu lost her balance and bumped hard against the shoe cabinet. She cried out in pain.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao hurried over. They stared at the middle-aged woman and asked warily, “Who are you?”\n“What are you doing at our house?”\nThe middle-aged woman looked at the three children and shouted loudly, “Where’s Qiu Tong? Come out and see me!”\n“You’re already a mother, but you still went out to steal my husband! Do you have no shame? Since you have the cheek to do it, you should dare to admit it!”\nThe middle-aged woman suddenly pushed the children away. Qiu Xingqiao could not bear hearing such insults about Qiu Tong, so he opened his mouth and bit her arm.\n“Aiyo! No surprise that a mother like her would raise this kind of child!”\n“Are you born in the year of the dog?”\nThe middle-aged woman was in pain from the bite. She raised her hand to slap Qiu Xingqiao, but Qiu Tong ran out of the kitchen and grabbed her elbow.\nThe door to the villa was open, and the commotion had already attracted some onlookers.\nQiu Tong recognized that she was Professor Dong’s wife and tried her best to explain in a calm tone, “Perhaps there’s some misunderstanding between us, I can explain.”\n“But you can’t just insult my children and physically attack them!”\nQiu Tong shielded the children behind her as she stated this in a cold voice.\nWith a chilly smile, Madam Dong took out the photo from her handbag and threw it in front of Qiu Tong. “I have evidence!”",

She shouted, “Who would believe that a woman without a job can afford such a villa?!”\n“This villa must have been given to her by some man. She is already a mother of three but this vixen is really something!”\n“She is able to seduce my husband. You have to watch your man closely when you get home! Don’t let her seduce your…”\nMadam Dong was slandering Qiu Tong’s reputation. Her words were getting increasingly ugly.\nQiu Tong frowned and wanted to retort, but Qiu Xingqiao strode over and stood in front of her. He raised his head and shouted, “Shut up!”\n“Your photos are all blurry. No one can see anything clearly!”\n“I can say that it’s a photo of Mommy, who was kind enough to help an old uncle cross the road! What right do you have to say that Mommy is linked to him?”\nQiu Xingyu nodded vigorously. “This man looks very old! Our Mommy won’t like him. Besides, we already have a Daddy. He’s especially outstanding. This old lady must have misunderstood!”\nQiu Xingyuan raised his hand and covered Little Yu’s mouth, indicating for her not to mention Jin Yang’s identity.\nAfter all, he was the president so Qiu Tong’s marriage to him had to be kept a secret. Qiu Xingyuan looked at Madam Dong coldly. He pursed his thin lips and said in a serious tone, “You barged into our house and can be charged with infringing on other people’s privacy and safety. We can call the police.”\n“We all believe that Mommy is innocent. If you think that there is something wrong with your husband, the problem might lie with you.”\nQiu Xingyuan was wearing a loose-fitting hoodie. He was clearly just a young kid, but in Qiu Tong’s eyes, he now looked indescribably tall, reliable and steady.\nMadam Dong was at a loss for words. The surrounding neighbors were swayed by the children’s opinions. The tables had turned.\nIn the villa area, a taxi suddenly braked at the door. Professor Dong came out from the back seat with an anxious expression. He grabbed Madam Dong’s arm unhappily. “Don’t embarrass me here. Go home!”\nMadam Dong misunderstood that he was defending Qiu Tong and became even angrier. She sat on the ground and started throwing a tantrum.\n“You haven’t been home recently. When you go home, you lock yourself in the study room!”\n“Keeping your phone and computer close to you all day every day, I have no idea what you are doing! You must be out fooling around with this vixen…”\n“After knowing that I’m here to cause trouble for her, you specially came here to help her out? I’ve been with you for more than 10 years, but you are not showing me any respect.”\nQiu Tong’s head ached at the sight of Madam Dong throwing a tantrum.\nHowever, Professor Dong’s research was confidential. To the outside world, he was just an ordinary university professor. It was difficult to explain.\n“Hello? Brother, they’re all bullying me. Come and help!”\nMadam Dong made a call and Professor Dong looked at Qiu Tong apologetically. “I’m sorry, I’ll compensate you for this.”\n“You still want to transfer money to her?”\nInfuriated, Madam Dong stood up and scratched Professor Dong. Qiu Tong raised her hand to protect the children and called Ke Le and the rest out to control the situation.\nSwoosh—\nTwo vans drove into the villa area. A few burly young men came out of the car with their sleeves rolled up. “Who bullied my sister?”\nJust as they were about to attack Qiu Tong, several gunshots rang out in the distance.\nEveryone looked shocked. Madam Dong was so frightened that her face turned pale as she muttered, “Brother, why did you bring guns?”\nThe young man shook his head. “It’s not us!”\nQiu Tong realized that they were heading straight for Professor Dong. Sensing that it was the evil foreign forces, she hurriedly ran to Professor Dong and shouted to Ke Le, “Bring the children in. Call the others out to help!”\nGunshots rang out in the villa district. Qiu Tong pushed Professor Dong’s head down and stuffed him into a bush to hide.\nMadam Dong hid under the trunk of a car and hugged her head in fear. She could not understand how this confrontation suddenly became a gunfight!\nThe evil foreign forces were all wearing black masks. They raised their guns and shouted, “Hand over the professor. As long as we get the formula for the human modification plan, we promise not to harm any innocent lives! Otherwise… don’t blame us for indiscriminately shooting at everyone.”\nTwo bullets tore through the air and grazed Qiu Tong’s arm, leaving two deep bloody marks.\nProfessor Dong held onto his glasses and opened his mouth to speak, but Qiu Tong put her index finger to her lips, indicating for him to shut up.\nKe Le and his mercenaries hid on both sides of the garden. They followed Qiu Tong’s instructions and waited for an opportunity to attack.\nQiu Tong took off Professor Dong’s hat and poked it out with a tree branch. As expected, it attracted the other party’s firepower to shoot at her…\n“Go!”\nQiu Tong gave Ke Le a signal and the mercenaries moved out in tacit cooperation.\nMeanwhile, Ye Luan, who was hiding at the door and listening to their conversation, looked nervous. His body was trembling uncontrollably and his lips were pale.\n“How did they…?!”",

Qiu Tong called the police chief and asked the police to come over to handle the interrogation.\nProfessor Dong and Madam Dong were so frightened that their legs went limp. They sat on a bench to rest. They looked at the scattered bullet shells on the ground and still felt fear lingering in their hearts.\n“Miss Qiu is a bodyguard I hired. She’s here to protect me!”\n“How could you come here to harass her without even clarifying things? If there are any problems between us, you should have come to me!”\nProfessor Dong handed a glass of warm water to his wife. His voice was reprimanding, but his eyes were filled with warmth and heartache.\nNow that she knew the truth, Madam Dong slapped her thigh in frustration. She stood up and walked to Qiu Tong, bowing deeply in guilt.\n“I’m sorry, I was just too anxious. I’m willing to bear the responsibility for the impact on you and the children!”\n“I’ll explain to the surrounding neighbors. I’ll rescind all my negative comments and help restore your reputation…”\nMadam Dong took out her phone and pointed at the email she received. “A woman who claimed to be Lin Shan called me last night. She said that she saw you two behaving intimately. When I heard her words and recalled Dong’s strange behavior recently, I couldn’t suppress the anger in my heart!”\nQiu Tong looked at Lin Shan’s phone number and email account. She frowned.\nLin Shan was really stubborn. No matter what, Qiu Tong could not shake this woman off. It seemed like she had to teach Lin Shan a lesson!\nQiu Tong shook her head and comforted Professor Dong and Madam Dong. “The police report states that all the members of the evil foreign forces were arrested. Don’t worry, there won’t be any more members waiting to kidnap or threaten you.”\nProfessor Dong thanked her profusely and paid her full fees on the spot, before leaving with his wife.\n…\nWhen they returned to the villa, Qiu Tong thought that the children would definitely be shocked and was about to comfort them.\nHowever, Qiu Xingyu was sitting in front of the sofa with the first aid kit. With a straight face, Qiu Xingqiao tugged at Qiu Tong’s fingers and pushed her down to sit on the carpet.\nQiu Xingyuan concealed the worry in his eyes. Holding a pair of scissors, he tugged at Qiu Tong’s shirt as gently as possible.\nThe three children huddled together and gasped when they saw the gunshot wound on Qiu Tong’s arm.\nQiu Xingyuan opened his hand and Little Yu obediently handed over the disinfectant, gauze and ointment.\nQiu Tong sensed their intentions and leaned back on the sofa, her heart feeling warm. She watched with gentle eyes as Qiu Xingyuan seriously treated her wounds.\n“If it hurts, just scream.”\n“We won’t laugh at you!”\nQiu Xingqiao’s brows were furrowed as he said that. The corner of Qiu Tong’s lips curled up. “It doesn’t hurt at all.”\nQiu Xingyuan glared at her, as if chiding her for trying to put on a brave front.\n“Do you lack money?”\n“We can also earn money. Elder Brother can develop medicine, Little Yu can design the procedures, I… I can contribute physical effort!”\nQiu Xingqiao scratched his head as he spoke. He suddenly felt a little useless!\nQiu Tong knew that the children would all become powerful leaders in the future, but she did not want to impose the pressure of life on them now. Her eyes were filled with love as she reached out to pull Qiu Xingyuan, Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu into her arms. She suddenly kissed their chubby cheeks with loud, clear smacks. Ke Le and the others at the side smiled when they saw the deep affection between mother and children.\nQiu Xingyuan rubbed his face awkwardly. “So much saliva!”\n“Mommy! Let me blow at your wound. It won’t hurt anymore then.”\nThe children surrounded Qiu Tong and showed their care for her in their own different ways, letting her feel the warmth of a family.\nAt night, after the children had fallen asleep, Qiu Tong went straight to Lin Shan’s residence. She climbed up to the window via the drainage pipe with her bare hands. She kicked open the window and saw Lin Shan, who had been startled awake. Qiu Tong grabbed Lin Shan by her hair.\n“You! You’re trespassing! I’m calling the police!”\n“What do you want to do? Let go…”\nLin Shan was so scared that she wanted to grab her phone. Qiu Tong kicked the phone to the ground and pressed Lin Shan’s head against the corner of the table. She said in a harsh voice, “If you dare to hurt my children again and affect my life, I will never let you off like today!”\n“You should know that I have a lot of connections.”\n“Stay away from me if you don’t want to die!”\nQiu Tong kicked her into a corner. Lin Shan clutched her abdomen in pain. She looked at Qiu Tong’s figure in the darkness and shivered in fear.\nHer lips trembled as she pleaded, “I won’t dare anymore! I really…”\nQiu Tong frowned and returned to the villa from Lin Shan’s place. She saw a small figure curled up at the entrance.\nShe hurried over and Ye Luan looked up when he heard her footsteps.\nHis deer-like eyes sparkled in the darkness. Seeing that he was dressed in thin clothes, Qiu Tong quickly hugged him. “Why are you outside?”\n“Do you have something to say to me?”\nQiu Tong asked patiently. She seemed to be able to read his mind.\nYe Luan opened his mouth. His peripheral vision landed on his own abdomen. He shook his head and said, “I’m just worried about you…”\n“It’s good that you’re back!”",

Jin Yang rolled up his sleeves tiredly. “Dad.”\nJin Tao turned around and glared at Jin Yang sternly. He nodded slightly and pointed at the sofa in the living room. “Sit.”\nThe atmosphere in the living room was strangely oppressive. The nanny placed a fruit platter in front of Jin Yang and left in a hurry.\n“What have you been busy with recently? I called the official residence several times, but Shao An said that you weren’t there…”\nJin Tao looked into the distance with an indifferent expression. His attitude was like a high-ranking official scrutinizing his subordinates. There was no affection or concern between father and son.\nJin Yang was very familiar with his attitude. He didn’t even find it strange.\n“There are hidden dangers abroad and locusts in many places in the country that had to be settled. The inaction of local officials had to be dealt with.”\n“I had to go and stabilize the situation and didn’t receive your calls. I’m sorry.”\nIt was hard to imagine that father and son were so distant.\nJin Tao sensed the hesitance and contradiction in his words. He asked calmly, “Has Song Yan contacted you recently?”\n“If he causes any trouble outside, we have to clean up after him.”\n“I advise you to find him as soon as possible…”\nJin Tao reminded him. Jin Yang looked up and smiled coldly. “Why? Are you going to keep him under house arrest here?”\n“You don’t have to worry about that.”\n“I heard from the butler that your health hasn’t been good recently. You should recuperate in peace.”\n“An external force has infiltrated S City. I might have to rush over to investigate for some time. Please take good care of your health.”\nJin Yang stood up and left, unwilling to stay any longer.\nHe gripped the cold door handle, wondering if he should turn around and say goodbye, but he swallowed the words.\nBang. The door closed.\nJin Tao waved and his subordinate walked out from a corner. “Go and check on Jin Yang’s recent movements.”\n“Investigate who he has been in contact with!”\nJin Tao narrowed his eyes, his cold gaze like sharp blades. For the sake of benefit and power, he would even treat his disobedient biological son as a threat and a thorny problem that needed to be dealt with. Kinship? He only cared about material things that could be held in his hands!\nIn the backseat of the car, Jin Yang rubbed his temples gently. He looked at Shao An, who was in the front passenger seat. “Book a flight ticket and come with me to S City.”\n“Sir, should I stay in the capital to help you scout for information? If I leave, it might ignite gossip and doubts among other officials…”\nShao An guessed that Jin Yang and the old man’s meeting had not been pleasant. He threw out a suggestion in a probing manner.\nJin Yang rejected him outright. “I’ve already informed him of my schedule. From now on, you can follow me at all times.”\nJin Tao wanted to control his actions and Shao An was the biggest obstacle.\nShao An was his subordinate and also his friend. Jin Yang swore to protect him.\nDing! Jin Yang activated the soundproof panel in the car and took out his phone. Without hesitation, he dialed Qiu Tong’s number. The phone rang twice and Qiu Tong answered, “Yes?”\nQiu Tong was rather unhappy that her sweet dreams had been interrupted.\nHowever, when she saw the caller ID, Qiu Tong turned on the night lamp and cleared her throat. “What’s the matter?”\nIt was three in the morning. Qiu Tong heard her heart beating anxiously.\nJin Yang suddenly smirked and shook his head. “Nothing. I just wanted to hear your voice. Why didn’t you call me?”\nAs if she was the lead actress in a romantic film, Qiu Tong rubbed her reddened ears and said in a gentle voice, “You are the president and are busy with work. I don’t want to disrupt your work.”\nTheir difference in status would always be a hurdle in Qiu Tong’s heart.\nShe had once sworn to stay away from dangerous people, but now… Jin Yang and her fell into silence. Only the sounds of their breathing could be heard. Qiu Tong felt sleepy and she slowly closed her eyes as she laid on the bed.\n“I’ll be in S City at noon tomorrow. Wait for me at home.”\nJin Yang listened to her steady breathing and knew that Qiu Tong was falling asleep. He had very naturally referred to her place as “home”.\nHalf asleep, Qiu Tong murmured. “Yes, I’m bringing the children to the amusement park.”\nJin Yang lowered the soundproof panel. The cool evening wind blew over and he felt much more awake. The gloominess in his heart dissipated.\nWhen Shao An heard the noise, he turned around and wanted to say something. Jin Yang raised his index finger and pressed it to his lips, indicating for him to shut up.\nHe hurriedly covered his mouth with his hand. From the corner of his eye, he saw the display screen on Jin Yang’s phone. He suddenly understood.\nIt seemed like there had been many changes in the relationship between the president and Qiu Tong!\nShao An’s ears pricked up in curiosity, but Jin Yang did not say anything else. He returned to the bedroom and quietly changed into his pajamas before lying on the bed. He listened to Qiu Tong’s breathing and soon fell asleep too.\nThat night, although they were thousands of miles apart, it was the first time they spent the entire night together on the phone…",

Qiu Tong fulfilled her promise and brought the children out for an outing.\nQiu Xingyuan and Little Yu helped to build a temporary tent for them to rest in. Qiu Tong set out the cutlery needed for their picnic and washed it before placing it on the lawn. The sight of the whole family coming together made the surrounding children cast envious gazes.\nYe Luan, who had come with them, sat alone in the shade of a distant tree. He was frowning and had his head buried in his knees, as if he had something on his mind.\nQiu Tong saw that he looked very lonely. She picked up two cups of hot milk tea and sat down beside Ye Luan.\n“Why? Do you miss home a little?”\nAfter Qiu Tong brought Ye Luan back, she never asked about his family situation.\nShe felt that those were Ye Luan’s private matters. If he wanted to talk about it, he would naturally take the initiative to tell her. She did not wish to keep probing.\nYe Luan shook his head. He held the milk tea with both hands and looked at Qiu Tong hesitantly. “Auntie Qiu, I’m keeping something from you.”\n“But… I promised Daddy to keep it a secret. I can’t tell anyone.”\nYe Luan trusted Qiu Tong. He rubbed his fingertips in frustration and subconsciously rubbed the part of his skin that was over the chip.\nQiu Tong stroked the top of his head gently. “Since you promised Daddy, you have to keep your word!”\n“I took care of you and brought you home because I wanted you to be happy, not because I want you to do anything for me!”\nQiu Tong hugged Ye Luan and patted his back.\nYe Luan felt a surge of warmth in his heart. However, three resentful gazes were staring at them from a distance.\nQiu Xingyu pursed her lips and tugged at Qiu Xingqiao. “Mommy has been very concerned about Brother Ye Luan recently!”\n“I saw them whispering in the living room last night! Mommy brought us out today to play but her attention is all on him.”\nQiu Xingyuan tugged at the tent rope as he pondered with a complicated expression.\nAfter a while, he suddenly said to Qiu Xingqiao, “Invite him to play football with us.”\nQiu Xingqiao shook his head vehemently. “I don’t want to!”\nQiu Xingyuan rummaged through his bag for a soccer ball. His gaze landed on Ye Luan as he said in a mild tone, “Only when our relationship with him gets better will she spend more time with us!” Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu suddenly understood and nodded. The two of them ran over to invite Ye Luan to join.\nQiu Tong was pleased to see that the children were close. She carried Little Yu back to the tent to prepare the ingredients for dinner.\nIn the distance, three boys were playing soccer harmoniously. With the sunset, it was a beautiful scene.\nQiu Tong was cutting potatoes with a knife when Little Yu, who was beside her, stood up nervously. “Brother is fighting with them!”\nQiu Tong was shocked. The blade grazed her fingertips. She looked up and saw a few boys in the distance pushing each other. She hurriedly ran over.\n“Say that again if you dare!”\nQiu Xingqiao gritted his teeth and growled. The boys, who looked to be a few years older than them, snorted coldly and retorted indignantly, “I told you! You’re all illegitimate children. You don’t have a father!” The boys smirked and made funny faces.\nQiu Xingyuan looked at them coldly. “That’s better than having a father, yet still having no one to teach you manners!”\nOne of the boys waved his fist toward the Qiu brothers.\nYe Luan, with his thin figure, stood out from behind. He blocked the other party’s fist, his eyes filled with determination. “Don’t bully them.”\nThe boy shook off his hand in disdain. “You don’t have either a mother or a father. You’re just a pitiful worm picked up by the Qiu family! Are you going to stand up for them now?”\n“You really know how to ingratiate yourself to them!”\nThe boy’s hurtful words made Ye Luan’s face darken, but he still protected Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao without retreating.\nQiu Xingyuan stared at Ye Luan’s back profile and retorted after a moment of silence, “He’s my brother. Who said he doesn’t have parents?”\n“Yes! Not only does he have parents, he also has siblings! You’re the pitiful one!”\nWhen Qiu Xingqiao heard his elder brother’s words, he immediately expressed his stance firmly.\nYe Luan didn’t expect them to say that. His eyes surged with emotions.\nQiu Tong stopped in her tracks when she heard this.\nThe mother of one of those boys rushed over. She knew that her child was in the wrong, but she still defended him. “My son did not speak any untruths. He is just a child. How dare you attack him?”\nQiu Tong saw that the other party was so unreasonable. She planned to persuade her children not to fuss with them.\nA pair of strong hands rested on her shoulders and Jin Yang’s deep voice came from beside her ear. “He’s so young and already knows how to spread false rumors. As his mother, if you continue to indulge him, he will just end up making bigger mistakes in the future!”\nThe boy’s mother doubtfully sized up Qiu Tong and Jin Yang. “You are?”\nJin Yang smiled gently at the Qiu siblings and said firmly, “I’m their father.”\nThump!\nQiu Xingyu threw herself into Jin Yang’s arms with red eyes. Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao also looked away and rubbed the corners of their wet eyes with the backs of their hands.\n“With me around, no one can bully you all.”",

Jin Yang took off his jacket and placed it in her arms.\nJin Yang rolled up his sleeves and used a lighter to light the charcoal.\nWhen Little Yu saw the burning flames, she immediately jumped up excitedly. The flames shone on the children’s faces. Their expressions were relaxed and happy, not affected by the commotion just now.\nYe Luan took the initiative to help pick up some thin branches. He saw Qiu Xingyuan carrying some firewood and hurriedly snatched the heavy load over.\nQiu Xingqiao wiped his face with the back of his dirty hand. He grumbled at the unfair treatment. “My load of firewood is clearly heavier.”\nWhen Ye Luan heard that, he turned back. Qiu Tong couldn’t help smiling when she saw that the children had grown closer.\nJin Yang was roasting meat skewers on the grill. This was his first time and he couldn’t control the heat well.\nHe ended up burning a couple of beef skewers. Shao An could not help chuckling. “So there are things that even the president doesn’t know how to do.”\nJin Yang looked up and handed over the failed product. “Eat them all.”\nShao An was shocked. “This will cause food poisoning!”\nJin Yang shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly and continued to ponder over the best way to barbecue. After experiencing countless failures, he finally walked over to Qiu Tong with a satisfactory piece of barbecued meat. He tried his best to hand it over in a casual manner. “This is for you. Try it.”\nQiu Tong overheard the entire conversation between him and Shao An earlier. She tried to keep a straight face and took the skewer from him. “Thank you.”\nBeside the bonfire, Jin Yang draped his jacket over Qiu Tong’s shoulders. From time to time, he would adjust the size of the fire.\nQiu Xingyu took the initiative to bring over for Jin Yang some food and fruit juice that she had prepared . Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao also awkwardly stuffed a couple of apples into Jin Yang’s hands. The children of the Qiu family treated him the same as they did with Qiu Tong. They were direct, but still somewhat awkward.\n“I’m especially happy today!”\nQiu Xingyu bounced on the spot, waving a sparkler in her hand.\nThe children sang loudly in unison. At night, on the lawn of the park, Qiu Tong felt a warmth she had never felt before. She slowly leaned her head on Jin Yang’s shoulder, enjoying the happiness of this moment. Jin Yang gently held her hand, his index finger and thumb pinching her palm, infusing her with warmth.\n…\nIn the villa, Qiu Tong hurried the children to the bathroom to shower before coaxing them to sleep. She was exhausted.\nQiu Tong dragged her tired footsteps to the second floor. She passed by the door of Jin Yang’s room and suddenly thought about something. She went back to her bedroom and came out with two sets of fresh clothes. She knocked lightly on Jin Yang’s door. Jin Yang turned the doorknob. He was still wearing a towel wrapped around his waist. He was wiping his wet hair and tilted his head to look at Qiu Tong.\n“Here, I prepared your pajamas.”\n“I bought the size according to Ke Le’s figure. It shouldn’t be too small.”\nJin Yang looked at her with a smile. Qiu Tong’s ears turned red as she walked into the room and placed the clothes on a stool.\n“Why did you prepare clothes for me?”\n“If you wanted me to come and stay here, why didn’t you contact me?”\nJin Yang asked jokingly. Qiu Tong frowned and turned to leave without replying. However, her toes accidentally kicked the corner of the table. The intense pain made her fall forward uncontrollably.\nQiu Tong instinctively reached out to support herself against the wardrobe, but she fell into his strong arms instead.\nThe water droplets from Jin Yang’s hair fell on Qiu Tong’s arm. Qiu Tong rested her hand on Jin Yang’s shoulder. When she raised her head, she met his dark eyes, which were as deep as a pool. She was a little dazed. Jin Yang smiled and bent his index finger to tap the tip of her nose. He said in a doting and seductive voice, “If you wanted to stay, just say so. Why resort to this?”\nQiu Tong was taken aback. She came to her senses and pushed Jin Yang away slightly.\nAs she rushed to the door, Jin Yang leaned over and grabbed her elbow. With his other hand holding the back of her head, he leaned over and kissed her.\nQiu Tong felt her body go limp. She instinctively hooked her arms around Jin Yang’s neck and kicked the bedroom door shut.\nJin Yang chuckled. Qiu Tong bit his lower lip with a frown, punishing him in a teasing manner.\n“How long can you stay here?”\nJin Yang pulled off Qiu Tong’s hair tie and her wavy hair cascaded down with a lemon fragrance.\nJin Yang buried his face in her neck, his tongue licking her nimbly.\nHearing Qiu Tong’s question, Jin Yang replied with dark eyes, “As long as you want. I can stay by your side forever!”\nQiu Tong’s heart skipped a beat. Although she understood that these were just sweet nothings, she still could not help falling for them.\nShe took the initiative to wrap her legs around Jin Yang’s strong waist, inviting him deeper into her.\nJin Yang lowered his head and used his tongue to draw a beautiful picture of Qiu Tong’s body. He then explored her chest with his tongue.\nQiu Tong couldn’t help letting out a soft moan.. Jin Yang pressed his fingers into her and started to give Qiu Tong a most exciting and satisfying experience.",

She was making a soup according to a recipe, and a fragrant aroma soon wafted out of the pot.\nJin Yang stretched his body and walked to Qiu Tong’s side in his loose pajamas. “Do you need my help?”\nQiu Tong turned on the tap to wash the children’s utensils. She nodded in the direction of the refrigerator. “Ke Le and the others bought a lot of prawns and crabs yesterday when they were shopping in the supermarket. Help me prepare them. We will steam them for dinner.”\nJin Yang nodded and followed her instructions.\nThe villa was very quiet. Warm light shone on the two of them. Even though neither of them spoke, they felt very relaxed and at ease.\nJin Yang was in a tense state every day at the official residence of the capital.\nHere, he seemed to be able to shed all the pressure and burdens and enjoy the warmth and happiness of family life.\nQiu Tong stood on her tiptoes, wanting to open the cupboard door and place the dishes inside. Jin Yang appeared from behind and hugged her as he took the items. Qiu Tong pressed her back against Jin Yang’s muscular chest, her heart beating faster.\n“You seem to be very good at housework.”\nQiu Tong lowered her eyes to look at the hands at her waist. She suddenly recalled Song Yan’s warning and hints. “Are you as considerate and caring towards your former girlfriend?” Qiu Tong did not realize her voice held a hint of jealousy.\nJin Yang paused. He gripped Qiu Tong’s shoulder and made her turn around.\nTheir eyes met. Jin Yang felt as if two hands were gripping his heart, making it difficult for him to breathe.\nThe image of the woman’s back in his dream surfaced in his mind. A white light flashed past and the intense pain in his temples made him press his thin lips together.\nQiu Tong saw the thin layer of sweat on his forehead and raised her hand to wipe it for him. However, Jin Yang instinctively held her wrist tightly, his eyes cold.\nThree seconds later, Jin Yang regained his clarity. Cold sweat drenched his clothes.\nHe shook his head, confusion flashing across his eyes. “I don’t remember.”\nJin Yang didn’t want to lie to Qiu Tong, but such an ambiguous answer made Qiu Tong misunderstand. “I don’t have any intention of probing into the president’s private matters. I just want to know why you guys broke up. I want to try my best to avoid the problems that happened in the past. This will be good for the both of us…”\nQiu Tong replied in a fit of pique. She pushed Jin Yang away and wanted to walk around him. “Please stay away from me!”\n“We’re in a marriage of convenience. I can cooperate with you to pretend to be a married couple in front of the children, but I also want them to have a complete family, as well as a perfect father who can be relied on. A father they can be proud of.”\n“It’s just the two of us now. You don’t have to pretend. I won’t interfere with the president’s personal life.”\nJin Yang didn’t understand why Qiu Tong was suddenly so angry. He blocked her path. “Is this really how you think?”\n“Was what happened last night all fake?”\nJin Yang grabbed Qiu Tong by the waist and threw her onto the sofa in the living room, before leaning over.\nQiu Tong bent her knees in dissatisfaction and wanted to attack. Jin Yang noticed in advance and used his long legs to separate her legs. He bent over and kissed her.\nQiu Tong bit his lips angrily, the thick taste of blood spreading between their lips.\n“I like you.”\nJin Yang said in all sincerity. Qiu Tong met his deep eyes and sank into his heartfelt confession. She sighed softly.\n…\nOutside the villa, Shao An led the presidential guards to patrol the surroundings.\nA guard saw a figure flashing past the security booth. He ran over warily to investigate, but didn’t manage to catch the person.\nHe came back and reported the situation to Shao An. “Should we tell the president…”\nAfter all, the guards could tell how much Jin Yang valued the Qiu family. They didn’t dare to delay.\nShao An took out the gun at his waist and counted the bullets inside. “You guys get the surveillance footage from the management of the estate and carry out an investigation. After you confirm the other party’s identity and motive, you can report to Mr. Jin Yang. Don’t disturb him over such a small matter…”\nShao An stole a glance at the French windows beside the main entrance of the villa. He did not want to barge in and disturb his boss. He might be reprimanded!\n“Hey, hey, hey! Auntie, what are you doing?”\nJust as the guards were about to split up and carry out their mission, they saw a middle-aged woman with fluffy, permed hair rush to the door of the villa and press the doorbell.\nDing Dong. Jin Yang instinctively separated from Qiu Tong. He gently supported Qiu Tong’s waist and helped her pull down her shirt.\nQiu Tong tidied her messy clothes as she walked to the door. She cleared her throat and opened the door slightly. “Who is it?”\nThe neighbor saw that her face was flushed red and nosily stuck her head in to take a look.\n“What’s the matter?”\nJin Yang asked in a low voice as he held Qiu Tong’s shoulder.\nThe neighbor suddenly remembered her purpose of visit and hurriedly pointed in the direction of the kindergarten. “Go and take a look!”\n“Qiu Xingyuan and the rest are at the police station now!”",

      "content": "Chapter 227: Shock At The Police Station\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nIn the interrogation room of the police station, Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao were cooperating with the police officers and making their statements. Qiu Xingyu was sitting on a bench outside, chewing on a lollipop.\nJin Yang and Qiu Tong rushed to the police station as quickly as they could. They were stunned to see the little girl leisurely swinging her legs.\nThey had thought that the children had been in danger and were injured. Qiu Tong’s lips had already turned pale from anxiety, but the situation was completely different from what they had heard from their neighbor. Qiu Xingyu saw them standing at the door. She immediately jumped off the bench and threw herself into Qiu Tong’s arms.\n“Mommy, why are you here?”\nQiu Tong bent over and picked her up, carefully checking for any injuries.\n“What happened? Auntie Zhang saw you guys being taken away in a police car!”\nWhen the police officer heard the commotion and saw Qiu Tong and Jin Yang, he was shocked. He hurriedly brought Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao out.\n“Miss Qiu, your children are very vigilant. If it were any other children, they might be in danger.”\nQiu Tong’s heart skipped a beat. She frowned nervously at Qiu Xingyuan.\nQiu Xingqiao lifted his chin proudly. “We almost helped the police catch a bunch of baddies who specialize in child trafficking!”\nQiu Xingyuan calmly explained the situation. “The kindergarten was holding an outdoor hiking activity. When we were playing football in the nearby park, an old granny suddenly walked over in crutches. Little Yu saw that she was a little pitiful and took the initiative to run over to help.”\n“That old lady said that she forgot her way home. She wanted Little Yu to send her back.”\nQiu Xingyu nodded vigorously. With the lollipop still in her mouth, she mumbled in a daze, “She looked really pitiful!”\nQiu Xingqiao shook his hands helplessly. “Initially, Eldest Brother and I wanted to seek the teacher’s help, but Little Yu had already promised the old granny. She was in a bad state too. We had no choice but to follow her instructions and accompany her home. However, Eldest Brother soon realized that something was amiss. We are very familiar with the area around the kindergarten, but she kept leading us to a remote forest…”\nLittle Yu widened her dark eyes and hooked Qiu Tong’s little finger. “There were no residential buildings there at all!”\n“Eldest Brother guessed that she must be planning to trick us and sell us!”\n“We pretended not to notice and accompanied the old granny to the alley in front of the small forest. We remember Mommy said that if we meet bad people, we must think of a way to escape. Second Brother pretended to have his shoelaces undone and kept a distance from her…”\nQiu Xingqiao spread out his hands, white powder still lingering on his fingertips.\n“Fortunately, we had the powder that Eldest Brother developed. When the granny was momentarily distracted, we threw it all over her.”\n“She was temporarily blinded and we took the opportunity to run here and find the police!”\nQiu Tong was shocked as she listened to the children’s narration.\nJin Yang accompanied the children to the evidence room. Qiu Tong looked at the surveillance footage. “Have you found those people?”\nThe police officer pointed at two magnified screenshots from the surveillance cameras. “They should be from an organization and the action was premeditated. This is the elderly woman whom the children mentioned! But after discovering that the children had run away, two vans appeared at the intersection and drove her away…”\n“They were aware of the surveillance cameras and we didn’t manage to capture a clear picture of their faces, so it’s a little difficult to track them down.”\nQiu Tong asked for a copy of the video. She had a feeling that these people were not ordinary human traffickers. Perhaps they were linked to those people in the capital!\nQiu Tong brought the children home. Jin Yang shot Shao An a look from the door.\n“Arrange for men to investigate the surrounding districts discreetly. We have to find those people!”\n“The van they are in should have been rented locally or pieced together from a scrapyard. Qiu Xingyuan’s powder will cause temporary blindness. Go to a nearby clinic and see if there are any records of such a patient. Follow the clues and investigate!”\nShao An did not dare to delay and ordered his men to strengthen the security around the villa.\n“If you see anyone suspicious, report it immediately!”\nShao An said with a cold voice. He suddenly remembered the suspicious figure that someone had reported that morning. He could not help frowning. “Could they be in cahoots?”\nIn the living room, Qiu Tong gathered the children together.\n“You guys didn’t panic when faced with danger. You know how to work together. Mommy is happy.”\n“However, Mommy told you before not to trust strangers, much less leave with them. If Little Yu can’t remember this, you will be scolded! Something similar might happen again soon. Mommy has already applied for leave from the kindergarten. You guys can rest at home for the next few days.”\n“If anyone thinks of any details that you’ve missed, you must tell Mommy! Got it?”\nQiu Tong looked at Little Yu’s dejected expression and pinched her chubby cheeks. “Mommy will cook crabs for you guys tonight.”\n“Okay?”\nIt was relatively easy to cheer up little kids. Qiu Xingyu’s face instantly lit up.. On the other hand, Qiu Tong’s heart felt incomparably heavy.",

      "content": "Chapter 228: Capturing Xiao Zhen\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nLate at night, Shao An brought some guards to patrol the perimeter of the villa.\nTwo suspicious vans pulled into the parking lot across the street. Shao An secretly observed them for over 10 minutes but could not see the faces of the passengers inside. He felt that something was amiss and immediately sent guards to surround the exit.\nShao An, who was disguised as a security guard in a villa district, slowly approached the van and knocked on the glass window of the driver’s seat.\n“Sorry, residents who are not from this district cannot park here. Please leave as soon as possible.”\nShao An said in a low voice. Someone in the passenger seat rolled down the window. He had a neat buzz cut and a murderous look in his eyes.\nHe took out two stacks of cash and handed them to Shao An. “Make an exception. We just need to park here until tomorrow morning.”\n“Those are the rules. I can’t make an exception.”\nShao An circled to the passenger seat, wanting to spy on the situation in the back of the van.\nThe man in the passenger seat immediately sat up vigilantly and blocked Shao An’s view. His guilty reflex made Shao An certain that there was something fishy going on. He signaled with his hands behind his back before quickly subduing the man in the passenger seat. Guards ran over from all sides and blocked the van.\n“Get out of the car now!”\n“Put your hands behind your head! Squat on the ground and don’t move!”\nThe guards did a headcount and soon realized that these people appeared to be mercenaries.\nThe door at the back of the van remained shut for a long time. The guard reported to Shao An. He walked to the door and suddenly pulled it open. He was shocked to see the person sitting inside. The atmosphere in the parking lot became heavy and awkward because of the unexpected appearance of this person…\nAt the villa, the doorbell rang.\nQiu Tong saw Shao An’s grim expression and turned to call out to Jin Yang, who was playing with the children.\n“Sir, there’s something I need you to handle.”\nShao An was obviously hiding something. Jin Yang grabbed his jacket and left with him. The two of them chatted for a short while outside. “We’ve already caught the people who tried to kidnap the children of the Qiu family, but their leader… I hope you can go take a look.”\nJin Yang kicked open the metal door of the warehouse and saw Xiao Zhen sitting on a rusty chair with a flustered expression.\nWhen Xiao Zhen saw Jin Yang, he immediately stood up in fear. He bowed and said, “I didn’t expect to meet you here!”\nJin Yang scanned the mercenaries squatting by the wall coldly. Most of them were soldiers who had retired from the military.\n“Why do you want to kidnap the Qiu family’s children?”\nXiao Zhen hurriedly shook his head and explained, “Mr. President, it’s just a misunderstanding!”\n“My good friend in the capital lost his children not long ago and he asked me to help him search for them. Coincidentally, I received news that children who fit the description had appeared recently, so I wanted to come and look for them! I didn’t expect there to be a mistake. I got the wrong children!”\n“I reprimanded my men immediately. Tonight, I wanted to find the parents of the children, whom we frightened earlier today, and personally come to apologize!”\nXiao Zhen fabricated a lie that was full of loopholes. Jin Yang narrowed his eyes and sneered. “You’re looking for lost children and had to hire an old granny to deceive them? Do you think I’m an idiot to be fooled?”\nExtreme anger radiated from Jin Yang’s body, causing Xiao Zhen to shake his head in fear.\nXiao Zhen held an important position in the government and Jin Yang could not remove him from his post because of this. Jin Yang knew that Xiao Zhen was hiding something, but he could only warn him. “Stay away from the Qiu family. If I see you again, I will make you disappear…”\n“Do you understand?”\nXiao Zhen’s legs trembled as he hurriedly agreed.\nJin Yang and Shao An led the team away. Xiao Zhen heaved a sigh of relief and collapsed onto the chair. He took out the phone from his pocket with a trembling hand and dialed the number.\nShao An followed Jin Yang and looked at his grim side profile. He could not help asking, “Sir, why did you release Xiao Zhen?”\n“We found many kidnapping tools in the two vans, including ropes and handkerchiefs soaked with tranquilizers. We can confirm that the kidnapping is premeditated and part of the trafficking process. With the evidence we have now, we can send him to military court, then dismiss him and convict him!”\nShao An knew how concerned Jin Yang was with Qiu Tong and her children. He would never have let Xiao Zhen off with just a warning.\n“Do you believe what Xiao Zhen said? He’s just here to help his friend find his lost children?”\nJin Yang stopped in his tracks. “I asked you to investigate Qiu Tong’s connections and social background, and everyone connected to her. Did you see any links between her and Xiao Zhen? There must be a deeper conspiracy behind this matter!”\n“I released Xiao Zhen because I want to set him up as bait. I want to see who is the mastermind controlling him from behind the scenes!”\nShao An widened his mouth in realization. He gave Jin Yang a thumbs-up and praised him. “As expected, Sir is far-sighted.”\nJin Yang looked up at the round moon hanging in the sky. He had a vague sense of foreboding in his heart.\nXiao Zhen held a high position in the government. For someone like him to personally come to S City to kidnap the children of the Qiu family…\nWhat was so special about Qiu Tong?\nOr was Xiao Zhen actually here for him?!",

      "content": "Chapter 229: She’s A Substitute\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nIn the capital, the phone in the study room of the Jin residence rang three times before cutting off.\nXiao Zhen paced around nervously and waited. He stared at his phone and answered the call the moment he received it. “Sir, the plan failed.”\n“President Jin Yang lives with Qiu Tong and her children. He has already discovered our plan and has arranged for Shao An and his guards to be on standby.”\n“Do you want me to continue with the plan? Please give me your instructions.”\nXiao Zhen straightened his back and waited for the other party’s order compliantly.\nJin Tao’s furrowed brows were reflected on the glass in the study room. He was silent for a long time before saying, “You can come back now.”\nThe call was cut off and Jin Tao received a photo document from Xiao Zhen.\nHe clicked on it and saw a blurry photo of Jin Yang and Qiu Tong playing with the children on the lawn.\nUnbelievable! Jin Yang went to S City for them?\nJin Tao said to his assistant, “Book me a ticket to S City.”\n…\nThe next morning, Jin Yang looked at Little Yu, who was playing alone in the living room. He looked around for Qiu Tong, but did not see her.\nLittle Yu pushed some toy blocks toward him. “Mommy got a call and went out!”\nJin Yang glanced at the clock on the wall in puzzlement. Who would ask to meet with Qiu Tong at eight or nine in the morning?\nQiu Tong arrived at the cafe at the appointed time. Jin Tao was already sitting in a corner booth. He nodded at Qiu Tong and pointed at the seat opposite him. “Thank you for coming all this way. What would you like to drink?”\nHe raised his hand to call for the service staff. Qiu Tong put down her bag and straightened her back warily. “Just give me a glass of water.”\nJin Tao and Jin Yang were indeed father and son. They looked very similar.\nBut this man in front of her was more mysterious than Jin Yang. Even though Qiu Tong was sitting opposite him and could feel a thick aura surrounding Jin Tao’s body. She could not guess his true thoughts and intentions. She gently stroked the rim of her glass, waiting for Jin Tao to speak.\n“Jin Yang told me not long ago that he was coming to S City to stay for the long-term. I thought it was because of official business, but it seems like it’s because of you.”\nQiu Tong frowned and wanted to explain, but Jin Tao interrupted her.\n“I have no intention of blaming you. Jin Yang is an adult. He has the right and freedom to choose his life partner.”\n“Don’t think that I’m a traditional parent. I never believed that the president has to marry the daughter of a high-ranking official…”\n“It’s just that I’m very curious what kind of woman can make him forget about the past. Seeing you today, I kind of understand. You’re indeed very similar to her. Not only your appearance, but also your aura. I also nearly mistook you for her…”\nAs Jin Tao spoke, Qiu Tong asked in confusion, “Who is she?”\n“Didn’t Jin Yang mention her to you?”\nJin Tao held the teacup to his lips and took a sip. He appeared surprised. “Jin Yang had a fiancée a few years ago.”\n“They were very much in love. They got engaged and were preparing for their wedding. But for some reason, they suddenly broke up. Jin Yang also sank into depression for a long time because of this. Even now, we don’t dare to talk about the past in front of him.”\n“Fortunately, I have you to help him walk out of those painful memories. As his father, I need to thank you.”\nJin Tao put down his teacup and looked at Qiu Tong’s expression seriously.\nHe had a fiancée?!\nMixed emotions surged in Qiu Tong’s heart. She clenched her hand around the glass, the paleness of her knuckles revealing her true feelings.\nTime passed minute by minute. Qiu Tong could not sit still and wanted to leave.\nJin Tao stood up with his usual expression and buttoned his jacket. “Can I ask you a favor as his father?”\n“Don’t tell Jin Yang about our meeting today.”\n“I don’t want him to misunderstand. I hope you understand.”\nQiu Tong nodded.\nShe left the cafe and sat in a nearby park for a long time.\nQiu Tong recalled all the details of her interactions with Jin Yang. Those images flashed across her mind like a movie in slow motion. Her heart felt like it had been pierced and a cold wind kept blowing through it, bringing endless pain.\nIt turned out that Jin Yang’s feelings and care for her was only because of another woman!\nNight fell. Qiu Tong got up and went home. She stood at the entrance of the villa and looked at the lights inside before taking out her key.\nWhen Jin Yang heard the sound of the door opening, he ran over and reached out to take Qiu Tong’s bag. “Why are you back so late?”\nQiu Tong looked up at him and instinctively avoided his touch. She said coldly, “Thank you.”\n“I’m not feeling well. I am going to my room.”\nQiu Xingyuan laid on the sofa. Seeing Qiu Tong’s expression, he immediately sensed that something was wrong. He turned to look at Jin Yang and asked, “Did you make her angry?”\nJin Yang held up his hands in bewilderment. He also wanted to know what the problem was!\nQiu Xingyuan patted Little Yu’s shoulder and pointed to the bedroom on the second floor. “She likes you the most.. Go and ask her what happened.”",

She tilted her head and asked in a childish voice, “Is Mommy feeling unwell?”\n“Did Uncle Jin Yang do something wrong and make you angry?”\nQiu Tong burst out laughing. She cupped Qiu Xingyu’s adorable face. “Do you like Jin Yang very much?”\nQiu Xingyu thought about it seriously for a while. “Yes! Uncle Jin Yang is very good to us. He will play games with me very patiently.”\n“He helped Elder Brother adjust any wrong data in his experiments and also corrected Second Brother’s fighting stance!”\n“In the past, I was very envious of the other children in the kindergarten as they had parents to fetch them home. But now, I also have Uncle Jin Yang!”\nQiu Xingyu excitedly waved her arms as she listed out Jin Yang’s various strengths.\nQiu Tong could see how dependent the children were on Jin Yang. She did not know how to tell them that all of this could disappear at any moment.\nHalf an hour later, Qiu Xingyu came out of the bedroom.\nIn the living room, Jin Yang, Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao looked up at her at the same time. They surrounded her curiously.\nQiu Xingyu pursed her lips and pointed at Jin Yang. “Mommy must be unhappy because of Uncle Jin Yang! Every time I talk about you, Mommy always looks sad. Did you do anything bad behind our backs?”\nThree pairs of eyes stared at Jin Yang. Jin Yang recalled his recent actions and shook his head. He held up three fingers and swore. “Definitely not!”\nQiu Xingyuan supported his chin with his hand. He carefully considered the call Qiu Tong had received and felt that there must be a problem!\nQiu Xingqiao asked with a worried expression, “What should we do now?”\nQiu Xingyuan gestured at Jin Yang to come over. The four of them put their heads together and discussed a plan.\n…\nThe next day, Jin Yang and the children sat obediently at the dining table.\nThey looked at Qiu Tong’s busy back profile in the kitchen and signaled to each other with their eyes.\nQiu Xingqiao cleared his throat. Just as he was about to speak, the doorbell rang and interrupted their plan.\nJin Yang pushed open the door with a frown. Song Yan smiled brightly as he greeted him. He pushed Jin Yang away and bent over to find a pair of slippers to change into. He walked straight to the kitchen and said to Qiu Tong, “Can I trouble you to add another place setting?”\nQiu Tong nodded and they all sat at the dining table, eating in silence.\nQiu Xingyu secretly stepped on Qiu Xingqiao’s feet under the table. He gasped in pain and successfully attracted Qiu Tong’s attention.\nQiu Xingqiao’s eyes flickered. He said in a weak voice, “Mommy! Uncle Jin Yang wants to bring us to the reservoir to fish, is that okay?”\nLittle Yu pursed her lips and hurriedly added, “It’s been very chaotic outside recently. There are always baddies wanting to capture children!”\n“I will only be at ease if Mommy comes with us too, okay?”\nQiu Xingyu looked up at Song Yan and asked, “What about you? Do you want to come also?”\nSong Yan was very surprised. He glanced at Jin Yang’s ugly expression and immediately agreed.\nAfter their meal, Jin Yang, Qiu Xingyuan and the rest gathered in a corner to discuss their plan. Song Yan and Qiu Tong stood side by side in front of the kitchen sink, washing the dishes. His lips curled into a teasing smile as he asked in a low voice, “Why? Did you guys quarrel?”\nQiu Tong denied it, but Song Yan did not mind. He deliberately moved closer to Qiu Tong’s side. “Anyway, I’m willing to do anything that can make Jin Yang unhappy. Do you want to see him so jealous that he goes crazy?”\n“Why don’t we give it a try?”\nSong Yan’s eyes flickered with the excitement of a prank. Seeing their intimate behavior, Jin Yang quietly gritted his teeth, his eyes dark.\nAt the S City reservoir, Qiu Xingyuan threw out his fishing rod. He sat on a small rock by the shore and waited for the fish to take the bait.\nJin Yang held his own fishing rod as he prepared the bait. He had wanted to use the excuse of teaching Qiu Tong how to fish to resolve this inexplicable cold war with her. But Song Yan had rushed over to Qiu Tong to guide her.\nSong Yan raised his eyebrows smugly at Jin Yang, before taking the seat beside Qiu Tong.\nWhen Qiu Xingyu saw that Jin Yang’s plan had failed, she stomped her feet anxiously and ran to Qiu Xingyuan’s side to discuss a new strategy with him.\nAfter a while, Qiu Xingqiao ran back from afar. He pointed at a building in the distance and whispered.\nQiu Xingyu’s eyes gradually lit up. She nodded vigorously and gave him a thumbs-up. “Good idea!”\nJin Yang and Qiu Tong were sitting very far away from each other. Qiu Tong was focused on the calm water, while Jin Yang was paying attention to Song Yan and her actions. He could not sit still. Qiu Xingyuan and Little Yu suddenly cried out in panic. The fish that had been about to bite the bait were frightened away by their high voice.\n“Mommy, Second Brother is gone!”\nQiu Xingyu rubbed her eyes and pointed at a building in the distance. “He said he wanted to play an adventure game. Eldest Brother and I thought he would return soon, but we haven’t seen him yet! Could something have happened to Second Brother?”\nQiu Tong saw that the dam was fenced off by railings and knew that Qiu Xingqiao could not have fallen in. Her heart relaxed a little.\n“Don’t worry. Be good and wait for Mommy here. Don’t run around.”\n“I’ll go over there to take a look…”",

      "content": "Chapter 231: Locked In The Factory\nAs the night deepened, the surrounding weeds limited their vision.\nQiu Tong shouted Qiu Xingqiao’s name anxiously. She was worried that some kidnappers had already taken him. She quickened her pace and searched the area but did not find any traces of Qiu Xingqiao.\nJin Yang wanted to get his guards to help. Qiu Xingyuan tugged at the corner of his shirt, indicating for him to bend over.\n“He’s hiding on purpose. That building ahead is an abandoned factory. Bring Mommy there to find him!”\n“Xingqiao and I will lock the metal door from the outside and buy you and Mommy some time to be alone.”\nQiu Xingyuan looked at Jin Yang. He really did not expect to be helping this fellow!\n“I hope you can coax her. Otherwise, Xingqiao and I will be scolded.”\nSeeing that he was still standing rooted to the ground, Qiu Xingyuan urged him. “Hurry up and go!”\nJin Yang finally understood what the children’s intentions were. He hurriedly chased after Qiu Tong and brought her to the vicinity of the building. He pointed in front awkwardly and said, “Could he be just fooling around and hiding inside?” Qiu Tong thought of Qiu Xingqiao’s character and felt that it was possible, so she followed him.\nQiu Tong searched every corner of the factory with a flashlight.\nSong Yan wanted to accompany them, but Qiu Xingyu raised her arms and stood in front of him. “Uncle Song Yan, I’m so scared!”\n“Will you stay here with me?”\nSong Yan did not know how to reject her. He looked at Qiu Xingyu, who was hugging his thigh like a koala bear. He had no choice but to stand there and wait with her.\nThe three children each had their own task. Qiu Xingyuan waited for Jin Yang and Qiu Tong to walk into the factory and signaled to Qiu Xingqiao, who was hiding in the dark. The two of them struggled to push the metal door beside them. With a screeching sound, the door slowly closed.\nQiu Tong frowned in shock. She rushed over as fast as she could, but Qiu Xingyuan secured the door with an iron chain.\n“You guys are ridiculous!”\nQiu Tong shouted angrily. Qiu Xingqiao pressed his face against a gap at the metal door. “Mommy! I’m sorry!”\n“Two hours. Eldest Brother and I will stand guard in front. We’ll let you and him out when the time is up.”\nQiu Xingqiao was safe so Qiu Tong could finally relax. She turned to look at the calm Jin Yang, her tone questioning. “You colluded with them?” Jin Yang shook his head. “I only knew a few minutes earlier than you…”\n“Let’s sit down and talk, alright?”\nJin Yang moved a metal bucket over and wiped the dust off with a handkerchief. He looked up at Qiu Tong. “Ever since you met your friend yesterday, you’ve been behaving resentfully against me. If I did anything wrong, you can just tell me. Perhaps I can explain.”\nQiu Tong was feeling very gloomy. She stared into Jin Yang’s dark eyes and bit her red lips angrily.\nShe kicked the metal bucket away, suppressing her frustration.\nThere were two old electric fans at the chimney of the factory. Spider webs hung on the fan blades. A rotten smell permeated the air.\nQiu Tong clenched her fists and asked in a low voice, “Are you hiding anything from me?”\nJin Yang was stunned and couldn’t answer.\nQiu Tong chuckled softly at his pause. She shook her head, sighing at her own stupidity and naivety. She was actually hoping that Jin Yang would be honest with her.\n“The goal of our marriage of convenience is to get rid of Song Yan’s interference and his lawsuit. I’m very grateful to you for helping our family.”\n“The children really like you. I can tell they want to play matchmaker…”\nQiu Tong’s voice choked, but she quickly returned to her normal state. She restrained the emotions in her eyes and looked at Jin Yang tenderly.\n“I’m sorry to have troubled you. From now on, we will still pretend to be husband and wife in front of the children.”\n“But privately, please keep your distance from me. I don’t want to create trouble for us!”\nQiu Tong had drawn a clear line between the two of them, defining their relationship as just business partners.\nJin Yang took a step forward. He wanted to grab her wrist, but his arm ended up just hanging in mid-air. He did not reach out…\nTime passed by slowly. Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao unlocked the iron chains with anticipation. They saw Jin Yang and Qiu Tong walk out. They still appeared cold with each other. Qiu Xingqiao glared at Jin Yang with questioning eyes.\nJin Yang sighed deeply. Qiu Xingyuan glanced at him with disappointment before chasing after Qiu Tong.\n“Yo, looks like your plan has failed!”\nAs a bystander, Song Yan had seen through the children’s plan from the start. He pinched Qiu Xingyu’s chubby face and said smugly, “Maybe I will have a chance now!”\nQiu Xingyu twisted her body and struggled to jump down from his arms. She made a face and stuck her tongue out at Song Yan.\n“We will never acknowledge you as our Daddy!”\n“I like Uncle Jin Yang!”\nFaced with her childish declaration, Song Yan rubbed the tip of his nose with his finger. “It looks like my approval rating is very low!”",

The children followed her closely, their low spirits affected the entire atmosphere.\nJin Yang saw that she was struggling to carry the camping and fishing gear and wanted to help, but Qiu Tong pushed his hand away and said calmly, “Thank you, you don’t have to worry about this.” Anyone could tell that the two of them were in conflict.\nSong Yan leaned against the SUV with his arms crossed as he gleefully watched the scene.\nJin Yang blocked Qiu Tong’s path and pressed against the car door. “Don’t be like this. We can resolve this.”\nQiu Tong remained expressionless. She looked up at Jin Yang and said in an extremely distant tone, “The children are watching. I hope you can maintain your dignity. I don’t want to talk to you about this now! Okay?”\nHer tone was pointed. Jin Yang’s heart tightened and he sat in the driver’s seat.\nThe full moon hung in the sky as the SUV sped along the highway in silence. Meanwhile, a row of young women stood in the living room of the Jin residence in the capital…\nJin Tao examined the girls, who were all of similar height, and chose the one who looked most similar to Qiu Tong.\nHe nodded in satisfaction. “Have you memorized all the necessary information?”\n“When you see them later, remember to keep your mouth shut! Don’t talk unnecessarily.”\nDressed in a light yellow dress, the girl nodded obediently and boarded the flight to S City.\nThe next day, Jin Yang came to Qiu Tong’s bedroom early in the morning. He wanted to wait for her to wake up and find an opportunity to resolve the misunderstanding between them.\nHe looked down at his watch and quietly listened to the sounds in the room.\nQiu Xingyuan passed by in his pajamas. He covered his mouth and yawned. He looked at Jin Yang with disappointment. “Mommy went out for a run with Song Yan early this morning. If you go out now, you should be able to make it for their last two rounds.”\nJin Yang frowned and was about to go out to find them when he received Shao An’s call.\nShao An stammered over the phone, “Sir, there’s a lady who wants to see you. Her status is quite special. You might need to meet her at the garden fountain…” Jin Yang frowned and went downstairs.\nAt the garden fountain, a woman in a pure white dress had her back to him. Shao An rubbed his hands nervously and hurried over when he saw Jin Yang.\n“Qiu Tong?! Why is she here?”\nJin Yang asked in a low voice. Shao An hurriedly shook his head. “I was also shocked when I saw her just now. This lady is simply too similar to Qiu Tong!”\n“But she’s the daughter of your father’s friend. Something happened at her home recently and she came to S City to avoid the fallout. You have to take care of her!”\nJin Yang looked very resistant. He stepped forward and had a perfunctory conversation with her.\nQiu Tong and Song Yan ran back. She wiped her sweat and saw the woman leaning on Jin Yang’s shoulder with teary eyes. She stumbled and fell.\nSong Yan helped her remove her shoes and socks. When he saw Qiu Tong’s swollen ankle, he looked at her in amusement and said, “Jealousy makes one clumsy.”\n“I can help if you want to test and see whose status is higher in Jin Yang’s heart. Yours or that woman’s.”\nSong Yan suggested with a wicked smile. Qiu Tong stared at the woman who looked very similar to her. “Is she Jin Yang’s former lover?”\n“I’m not sure. Maybe.”\nQiu Tong chuckled sadly. So Jin Tao was right…\nEveryone knew that she was just a substitute. She was the only one who had been fooled!\nSince Jin Yang’s lover had returned, he would probably leave, right?\nQiu Tong suddenly stood up. When her feet touched the ground, the pain made her lose her balance and stumble forward. Song Yan hurriedly pulled her into his arms and asked with a worried expression, “How is it? Do you want me to send you to the hospital?”\nJin Yang handed the woman over to Shao An and let him settle the issue. When he returned to the villa, he happened to see that ambiguous scene.\nHe strode over to Song Yan and wanted to snatch Qiu Tong over, but Qiu Tong stared at him coldly.\n“Please help me back to the house…”\nQiu Tong placed her hand in Song Yan’s and walked slowly as Jin Yang watched.\nJin Yang clenched his fists. Song Yan smirked, his eyes revealing a smug smile.\nBang—The door to the villa was slammed shut. Qiu Xingyu widened her eyes in shock and craned her neck to look around.\nWhen Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao saw that it was Song Yan who had helped her back, they sighed at the same time.\nQiu Xingqiao frowned. “Are they getting a divorce?”\nQiu Xingyuan rubbed his chin and pondered seriously. “Looking at the current situation, it’s very likely.”\nJin Yang was so stupid!\nWould women listen to reason when they were angry? They just needed unconditional love and doting!\nQiu Xingyuan sighed deeply and shook his head. Even a young child knew this, but he did not!\nWhen Jin Yang returned, Qiu Xingyu’s eyes darted around as she thought of a solution. She shot Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao a look and ran to Song Yan’s side, dragging him outside. “Uncle Song Yan! Little Yu lost her favorite toy. It might be in the garden outside. Help me find it!”\nSong Yan knew their plan, but he also wanted to see how low Jin Yang would go to appease Qiu Tong. He happily left with the children.\nJin Yang squatted down with a pained expression when he saw the bruise on Qiu Tong’s ankle.\nThe moment his cold fingertips touched Qiu Tong’s skin, she frowned and shouted, “Don’t touch me!”",

      "content": "Chapter 233: Reconciliation After A Fight\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\n“I don’t need you.”\nQiu Tong pushed Jin Yang away. She had originally wanted to use her special ability to heal her injury, but then she remembered that Song Yan had personally witnessed her injury. If she were to heal in just a few hours, she might arouse his suspicion. Qiu Tong lowered her hand and Jin Yang guessed her reason for stopping. He wanted to apply the medicine for her.\nShe lowered her eyes as images of the woman in the white dress leaning on Jin Yang’s shoulder flashed across her mind.\nQiu Tong shook her head, chasing away the messy thoughts.\n“Our so-called marriage of convenience is pointless. Song Yan has no intention of taking the children away. We don’t need to continue pretending to be husband and wife. I’ll think of a way to explain to the children. You just need to move out of the villa with your things.”\nInstead of waiting for Jin Yang to bring it up, it was better for her to sever this ill-fated relationship that should never have begun!\nQiu Tong’s pride made her unwilling to be the inferior party in love.\nJin Yang heard her merciless words and looked up at Qiu Tong in disbelief. “Because of Song Yan?”\nQiu Tong stood up and was about to leave when Jin Yang angrily pressed her shoulder.\nThump! Qiu Tong grabbed his hand and bent her body slightly, throwing Jin Yang to the ground.\nJin Yang wanted to fight back, but Qiu Tong pressed her elbow against his throat mercilessly. Her voice was cold as she warned, “I don’t want to fight with you. Please leave quietly and let us preserve our last bit of dignity!”\n“She probably doesn’t want to see you injured either!”\nWho was she? When Jin Yang heard Qiu Tong’s words, he propped himself up on the floor.\nQiu Tong limped to the bedroom door. Just as she pushed the door open, she heard hasty footsteps coming from behind. She gritted her teeth and threw a punch. Jin Yang used his palm to block her attack. Qiu Tong bent her knee and kicked his lower abdomen. Jin Yang dodged. Taking advantage of the moment, she grabbed the door handle and wanted to lock Jin Yang outside.\nJin Yang reacted quickly and stuck his arm into the gap to prevent the door from closing.\nQiu Tong exerted a lot of force. Seeing Jin Yang frown but remain silent, she instinctively let go of the door.\nEven if Jin Yang did not suffer any bone fractures, he would still need a few days to recover from that. His arm would definitely be bruised and so painful that he would not be able to lift it.\nQiu Tong could not hide her worry. Jin Yang smiled.\n“It’s quite worth it to exchange an arm for a chance to say a few words.”\nJin Yang walked into the room. He looked at Qiu Tong seriously and said sincerely, “As the president, countless terrorists and enemies have been eyeing me from the day I took office. They want my life. You saved me by the roadside, do you remember?”\n“I was heavily injured and unconscious for nearly half a month, so I lost a portion of my memories.”\n“I don’t remember what happened, and I can’t tell if the fragmented memories are real or just a dream I fabricated.”\nJin Yang looked at Qiu Tong deeply. He told her everything he had previously hidden.\nQiu Tong’s eyes flickered as she listened quietly in shock. She recalled the scars on Jin Yang’s body and could not help frowning as she guessed how many times he had been on the verge of death.\nJin Yang chuckled, as if he could see her worry. He comforted her, “I’m very safe now.”\n“I can’t give you an affirmative answer to what you want to know. I don’t want to lie to you either.”\n“But at this moment, the Jin Yang standing in front of you only has you in his heart! I didn’t propose marriage only because I wanted to help you keep your children. It was just an excuse which I spent a lot of effort to come up with…”\n“When I found out in the capital that you and the children were in danger, I decided to abandon everything and rush to S City to find you. I already decided that the only woman by my side would be you.”\nJin Yang’s confession was heartfelt. But his timing was somewhat off.\nAfter the fight, Qiu Tong’s hair was a little messy and Jin Yang’s shirt was stained with dust.\nQiu Tong’s emotions were in turmoil. She went from shock to acceptance before asking in a soft voice, “What about the woman outside? Isn’t she your lover?”\n“So you’re jealous?”\nJin Yang asked in surprise. Qiu Tong frowned unhappily. He immediately spread his hands and explained, “I don’t know her.”\n“She’s the daughter of my father’s friend and came from the capital. I only met her once per my family’s instructions.”\n“Shao An will handle the rest. I won’t meet her again.”\nQiu Tong did not expect the truth to be like this. She said in a huff, “But she looks very similar to me. I thought…”\nJin Yang smirked and slowly walked over to Qiu Tong. He raised his hand and pulled her into his arms. He leaned over and whispered gently in her ear, “But she’s not you! My heart is very small and can only accommodate one person. Her name is Qiu Tong.”\nQiu Tong clenched her fists and hammered his chest. Jin Yang pretended to be in pain. “Ouch!”\nThe temperature in the room rose because of the change in their relationship.. Qiu Tong looked at Jin Yang’s profile, but her heart was still troubled by his missing memories and of the former lover whom Jin Tao mentioned.",

      "content": "Chapter 234: Ye Luan Was Attacked\nAt the intersection, the traffic light changed colors.\nThe children deliberately found an excuse to stall for time as they brought Song Yan around.\nA small crowd had gathered near the parking lot of the supermarket. They were holding baskets and pointing across the road with complicated expressions.\nQiu Xingyu ran over curiously. She stood on her tiptoes to see what was going on.\n“Regardless of what a child did wrong, it’s definitely wrong to beat him! What if they cause permanent damage to the child?”\n“That child looks very stubborn. Look! He is even fighting back. It’s obvious that he has had a poor upbringing!”\nAn old lady in a flowery dress couldn’t help muttering, “Kids these days are really troublesome. They always cause trouble outside. This month alone, the school called my granddaughter’s parents to go to the school three times. My daughter doesn’t even dare to go to the school to face the form teacher anymore. She can’t scold or beat the child!”\nQiu Xingyu squeezed through the crowd and successfully came to the front.\nShe just wanted to take a look at the commotion and didn’t expect to see a familiar figure. Qiu Xingyu couldn’t help shouting, “Brother Ye Luan?”\nAcross the road, Ye Luan struggled to kick the tall stranger beside him away. When he heard Qiu Xingyu’s voice, he immediately shook his head nervously. “Run! Go back and find Auntie Qiu…”\nYe Luan wanted to say something else, but the man covered his mouth with his hand.\nWith a dark expression, he bent over and threatened Ye Luan. “Shout again and I’ll kill them all!”\n“You don’t want them to be implicated by you and live in danger from now on, right?”\nThe man could tell that Ye Luan cared a lot about the little girl. “As long as you obediently hand over what we want, we will never cause trouble for you again. That thing is useless to you, it will only be of the greatest use to us!”\nYe Luan gritted his teeth and didn’t say anything. He glared stubbornly at the man with the scar on his face!\nHe had been too careless!\nRecently, Ye Luan didn’t notice anyone following him. He thought that things were over.\nHowever, he did not expect this man to waylay him at the entrance of the school and pretend to be his father, wanting to drag him into the car and take him away.\nYe Luan wanted to run, but there were too many students and parents around. Cars and parents blocked the road.\n“I’m really sorry, my son is throwing a tantrum! Stop running! Come back now…”\nThe man fabricated a lie while Ye Luan tried his best to explain that he was not related to him. However, the surrounding parents looked at him coldly and even advised him not to quarrel with his father. “Daddy is doing this for your own good. Little boy, you have to understand where he is coming from!”\nThis situation made Ye Luan panic and frightened. He could only run towards the villa as fast as he could.\nAuntie Qiu! Save him!\nThis was the only thought that kept surfacing in Ye Luan’s mind…\nThe strange man grabbed Ye Luan’s throat and tried his best to drag him into the car. However, Qiu Xingyuan, Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu rushed over from the other side of the road. Little Yu shouted, “Let go of Brother Ye Luan! You’re a baddie! We’ve never seen you before!”\n“They are child traffickers!”\nQiu Xingyu turned around to look at the surrounding parents for help. Her dark eyes were filled with tears. Her pitiful and aggrieved look made the surrounding people waver as they stared fiercely at the strange man. The righteous crowd automatically pulled Ye Luan over and asked warily, “You said that you are his father. Do you have evidence? Hurry up and call the police. Call the police and let them investigate his identity!”\n“You guys… are really nosy.”\nThe strange man gritted his teeth and ran towards Qiu Xingyu. He raised his hand and grabbed Qiu Xingyu’s collar, wanting to use her as a hostage.\nQiu Xingyu was shocked. She hovered in midair and kept waving her arms.\nQiu Xingqiao took the opportunity to rush over. He aimed at the man’s knee and kicked. “Elder Brother!”\nQiu Xingyuan took out some powder and sprinkled it over the man’s eyes. The intense pain made the man sway and let go.\nQiu Xingyu fell heavily and Ye Luan rushed over to support her.\n“Brother Ye Luan?”\nQiu Xingyu rubbed her aching butt. When she opened her eyes, she saw that Ye Luan’s arm was bruised. The wound was stained with mud and blood.\n“Just you wait!”\nThe man’s vision blurred as he crawled up from the ground and fled in a sorry state.\nQiu Xingyu and Qiu Xingqiao helped Ye Luan to stand up. Qiu Xingyuan pursed his thin lips. Without a word, he picked up Ye Luan’s school bag from the ground and helped him carry it. Qiu Xingyuan muttered, “How troublesome.”\nYe Luan lowered his eyes as guilt flashed across his face. He said in a soft voice, “I’m sorry.”\nSong Yan stood under the streetlamp with his arms crossed, his eyes fixed in the direction where the man had fled.\nIt was just an ordinary gangster. The Qiu family’s children were enough to handle them. He did not need to make a move.\nBut why would a gangster cause trouble for Ye Luan?\nHe was just an ordinary school student, a wandering child whom Qiu Tong had picked up. Could it be that he had a secret identity?\nSong Yan stared at Ye Luan’s back profile and touched the corner of his lips with interest. Things were getting more and more interesting.",

      "content": "Chapter 235: Gray Zone\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nIn the villa, Qiu Tong saw that Ye Luan was injured and hurriedly brought him to the bedroom for treatment.\nQiu Xingyuan told Qiu Tong what had happened. Qiu Tong was putting disinfectant on Ye Luan’s wound and he squeezed his eyes tightly in pain.\nYe Luan’s entire body was trembling, but he still gritted his teeth and endured it, unwilling to reveal any weakness.\nQiu Tong knew that Ye Luan must be hiding something, so she felt guilty. She did not probe further. Instead, she turned around and looked at Qiu Xingyuan and the rest. She said in a harsh tone, “Mommy told you before that you’re not allowed to go out without good reason, especially when there’s been danger recently!”\n“Go back to your rooms now and write a diary entry to reflect on yourself. Mommy will check it tomorrow!”\nQiu Tong frowned when she saw them standing by the bed. She rested her hands on her waist and asked, “Are you all being disobedient?”\nQiu Xingyu pursed her lips and pushed Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao out the door with her.\nHearing the sound of the door closing, Qiu Tong saw the sweat on Ye Luan’s forehead. She took out a towel and wiped it for him.\nYe Luan’s lips were pale. He opened his eyes and said weakly, “Auntie Qiu, I’m sorry.”\nQiu Tong shook her head and smiled as she bandaged his wound. “The wound needs to be changed every day. I’ll take your temperature again at night. I’m afraid your wound might be infected by the dirt. Don’t worry about anything else, leave it to me.”\nQiu Tong gently stroked Ye Luan’s forehead and tucked him in before walking out of the room.\nShe returned to the bedroom and turned on the computer with a solemn expression, her fingers typing furiously on the keyboard.\nQiu Tong hacked into all the nearby surveillance systems as fast as she could. She locked onto the surveillance cameras across the school and found the relevant footage.\nShe clicked on the mouse and zoomed in. A clear face appeared on the screen, and the screenshot was sent to the police station’s registration system.\nQiu Tong soon found out who the person who tried to kidnap Ye Luan was. She had information on the other party’s identity and made an automatic system search. She searched through the entire internet for every little bit of information on him. As the information loaded, Qiu Tong stared at it without blinking until an address popped up on the screen.\nLate at night, Qiu Tong pushed open Qiu Xingyu’s bedroom door. She looked at the girl leaning on the desk with a pen in her hand, feeling a little exasperated and amused.\nShe removed the pen Qiu Xingyu was holding and carried her to the bed.\nQiu Xingyu was in a daze. She opened her eyes and saw Qiu Tong. She opened her arms and snuggled in Qiu Tong’s embrace. “Mommy, I didn’t do anything wrong!”\nQiu Tong comforted her. Before she left, she saw two lines of crooked handwriting in Qiu Xingyu’s diary. “When Brother Ye Luan was in danger, Little Yu rushed over to help him. Because we’re family, Little Yu is good!”\n“Mommy is just worried about me, so she’s very fierce. I know, so I don’t blame her!”\nQiu Tong chuckled. This little girl was really smart and adorable.\nShe checked that Ye Luan’s injuries had stabilized and left the villa.\nQiu Tong looked down at the navigation information on her phone and drove towards the address where the gangster was.\nThis was a downtown area. Many gangsters who did business in the black market lived here, and the police would deliberately avoid this place when patrolling at night. Simply put, these two blocks were gray zones beyond the reach of the law.\nQiu Tong parked the car at the intersection. As she stepped into the alley, the gangsters squatting by the side whistled at her.\nThey fiddled with the sharp daggers with their fingers as they stared at Qiu Tong with murderous gazes.\nQiu Tong’s expression was calm as she looked at them without a hint of panic. She rummaged through the photo album on her phone for a photo of the man she was looking for. She then approached one of the gangsters who looked like he had the most experience and connections. “Do you know where he lives?”\nThe old gangster shrugged and reached out an open palm. and Qiu Tong handed him a wad of cash.\n“Turn left, third room on the second floor.”\nThe old gangster told her, but a few other burly thugs saw Qiu Tong giving out money. They slowly approached, dragging metal rods on the ground.\nQiu Tong frowned. “Don’t block my way. I’m busy.”\nThe leader wiped the corners of his mouth and laughed arrogantly. “Hehe, pretty lady, we are busy people too.”\n“Either you give us money or you play with us and let us have a good time.”\nLecherous expressions appeared on their faces. Qiu Tong watched as the red dot on the tracking device started to move. She said impatiently, “We’ll have to see if you still have the life to come and get it!”\nShe dashed to the thugs’ side and lowered her body to sweep their lower bodies.\nThe thugs were caught off guard by Qiu Tong and their metal rods scattered all over the ground. The leader felt that he had been embarrassed and crawled up in a sorry state, wanting to punch Qiu Tong’s face, but his fist stopped five centimeters away…\nQiu Tong gripped his wrist tightly, the sound of bones breaking could be heard.\n“Alright!”\nThe surrounding gangsters whistled and cheered. Qiu Tong did not wish to continue fighting. She just stepped over them and headed to her destination.\nSomeone’s here. She is quite skilled. Pack your things and leave.\nA thug hiding in the dark sent a message to warn the man.",

      "content": "Chapter 236: Gangster Den\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nThe dilapidated building reeked of corruption everywhere.\nTrash was piled in front of every door, and the wooden stairs creaked.\nQiu Tong followed the old gangster’s directions and found the room. She looked down at the GPS on her phone and saw the flashing red dot.\nThe man who had attacked Ye Luan was squatting behind the door. He was holding a cup of instant noodles, drinking tea and chewing on a stale steamed bun.\nA phone placed on a paint bucket vibrated. He glanced at it and cursed before opening the message. “Damn you! You are paying me so little but I almost got arrested by the police. If you don’t raise the price, I’ll do this business with others!”\nQiu Tong took a step back when she heard the voice coming from inside. She then raised her leg and kicked open the ajar door.\nThe man’s mouth was still half full when he finally read the message on his phone. His eyes widened in shock.\nHe threw his instant noodles to the ground and tossed the paint bucket towards Qiu Tong. He turned around and wanted to jump out of the window.\nThe man was clinging onto the railing with both hands. Before his other foot stepped onto the windowsill, Qiu Tong had already grabbed his collar and dragged him back onto the ground.\n“I’ll fight you to the death!”\nSeeing that he could not escape, the man took out a foldable knife from his pocket and made stabbing motions.\nQiu Tong dodged and her waist hit the corner of the table. She gasped in pain.\nThe gangster used to belong to a criminal gang. He was timid by nature and would hide in a corner during gang fights. He had never tried to attack anyone with a knife before.\nHis movements were stiff as he brandished the foldable knife. Qiu Tong took advantage of the situation and struck his abdomen with her elbow, snatching the weapon.\nBang bang—Qiu Tong punched his head twice. The gangster fell to the ground and lost consciousness for several moments.\nWhen he opened his eyes again, Qiu Tong had tied his limbs to the bench.\nThe gangster saw Qiu Tong rummaging around and whimpered. “Who the hell are you?”\n“Please do me a favor. I’ve never committed arson or murder!”\n“If not for the fact that I can’t survive, who would want to hide in a place like this and live such a dark, shameful life?”\nThe gangster begged for mercy as he shifted his body, his feet making contact with the bench. Qiu Tong looked at him coldly. “Who sent you?”\n“Which matter are you referring to?”\nThe gangster instinctively asked in return. Seeing Qiu Tong frown, he hurriedly explained, “I stole a few phones previously, you…”\nQiu Tong could tell that he was just pretending to be an idiot. She bent over to pick up the foldable knife from the ground and used her fingers to push the sharp blade against the gangster’s neck artery. “I just need to gently press down here and you will die without even feeling any pain. If you dare to lie again, I’ll let you die.”\n“You wanted to kidnap my son. Who was behind this? What do you want?”\nQiu Tong exerted more pressure and a bloody cut appeared on the gangster’s neck. He was so frightened that his legs trembled and he shrank back.\nYe Luan?! This thought flashed across the gangster’s mind, but he quickly dismissed it. “Impossible!”\n“His family is all dead. You can’t be his mother!”\nThe gangster had some information about Ye Luan’s situation. Qiu Tong felt that there was more to this than meets the eye. She aimed the foldable knife at the gangster’s thigh and drove it in.\nThe blade dug into his muscles as he howled.\nQiu Tong pulled out her knife and placed it on the gangster’s neck. “Do you want to die or live?”\nThe gangster did not dare to look at Qiu Tong. He was so frightened that he peed his pants and cried miserably. “Please let me go. I really don’t know! I’m just doing it for money. They asked me to capture a boy. After I capture him alive, I’ll wait for them to contact me.”\n“Ye Luan is too smart. I followed him for a few days but didn’t succeed. I was even injured by a few children today.”\nThe gangster swallowed hard. “I’m telling the truth! If you don’t believe me, you can look at my phone records!”\nHe unlocked his phone with his fingerprint and took the initiative to point out the relevant records. Qiu Tong quickly scanned the information. “You can find him?”\n“It has always been a one-way communication. He’ll call when he needs to reach me. He will let the phone ring thrice and hang up, after which I’ll call him back.”\n“He changes his phone number every time. When I try to call the earlier numbers, it’s always disconnected.”\nThe gangster had his suspicions about this before, but the other party’s payment was too generous. He accepted it greedily.\nQiu Tong realized that the other party was very vigilant and careful. She removed the folding knife and the gangster heaved a sigh of relief.\n“When was the last time you contacted him?”\nThe gangster recalled. “Around five last night. He told me I had to get the child here as soon as possible.”\n“He’ll probably contact me today.”\nThe gangster’s phone rang.\nThe call ended after three rings. Qiu Tong looked at the encrypted caller ID and pressed the redial button.\nShe pressed the knife against the gangster’s artery again. “You know what to say!”\nThe call went through and there was silence on the other end.\nThe gangster cleared his throat, his voice trembling as he tried his best to control it. “That little brat is really too powerful. I almost caught him, but a few fellows who were slightly younger than him appeared out of nowhere and saved him..”",

If I don’t hear good news from you, you will need to pay for breach of contract.”\nThe other party used a satellite phone, and the voice had been processed using a voice changer. Qiu Tong had no way to track the other party.\nThe gangster sat on the ground, stammering, “I didn’t lie to you, right?!”\nQiu Tong surveyed her surroundings. She bent down and grabbed the gangster by the collar, before pushing him out.\nThe gangster pressed his hand against the door frame and looked back at Qiu Tong in fear. “Where are you taking me?”\nQiu Tong tilted her head, looking especially impatient. “If you want to wish here, I won’t stop you.”\nShe needed to control the gangster so that she could contact the other party. She would have to slowly lure the other party into revealing their identity and goal.\nIf she let the gangster stay here, he could easily reveal to the other party what happened today.\nBy then, the situation would be completely different. Qiu Tong could not take the risk.\nThe gangster hesitated. Qiu Tong saw that daylight was approaching and directly drove the knife hilt at his neck, rendering him unconscious. She then dragged the unconscious gangster into the car.\nThe moon hanging in the sky dimmed, and the sun rose faintly in the east.\nIn the room of the villa, Ye Luan was supporting his injured arm and strenuously packing his luggage.\nThe table was filled with the gifts Qiu Tong had given him. Ye Luan carefully put them away. He looked around the room reluctantly and gently stroked the blanket. Although he hadn’t known Qiu Tong for long, he treated the Qiu family as his own.\nIt was because they were his cherished family that Ye Luan had to leave them…\nYe Luan opened the door and pushed his luggage to the door, planning to disappear into the night.\n“Where are you going?”\nA clear voice came from behind. Ye Luan turned around stiffly and saw Qiu Xingyuan sitting on the sofa. He frowned, not knowing how to explain.\nQiu Xingyuan stood up and walked to the entrance. “Even if you want to leave, you have to bid farewell to everyone. Sneaking away is extremely rude. Did we do anything wrong to you? What’s the reason?”\nYe Luan lowered his eyes, his knuckles turning white as he gripped the luggage handle. “It’s not you guys, it’s me.”\n“I’ll settle my own problems. I can’t implicate you.”\nQiu Xingyuan frowned and pursed his thin lips in disagreement. “The terrorists in the hospital kidnapped and held us hostage. You helped us without any regards to your own safety.”\n“That incident had nothing to do with you. According to your logic, you could have just watched from the side.”\n“Do you think we’re cold-blooded and selfish? Or are we not worthy of your trust?”\nQiu Xingyuan’s tone was sharp. Ye Luan opened his mouth several times to explain, but he could only swallow his words. In the end, he just shook his head silently.\nQiu Xingqiao was woken by the commotion outside in the bedroom. He overheard the conversation between his elder brother and Ye Luan and immediately rushed over to snatch his luggage.\nHe raised his chin. “I hated you when Mommy brought you back!”\n“But after spending so much time together, I… I’ve already accepted and gotten used to having you at home. I’ve also told the children in kindergarten that I have two brothers. Don’t even think about leaving!”\n“Even if there’s trouble, we will definitely be able to solve it.”\nWhen Ye Luan saw their attitude, he felt a surge of warmth in his heart. He had never felt such warmth before.\nBang! Qiu Tong dragged in the kidnapped gangster, only to see three pairs of eyes staring at her.\nQiu Tong tied the gangster to a stone pillar in the living room and looked back at the piece of luggage placed in the empty space. “You’re running away from home?”\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao shook their heads at the same time. They pointed at Ye Luan and refused bluntly. “It’s him!”\nThere was a huge commotion on the first floor. Jin Yang, Ke Le and the rest came out of the room and saw the dazed gangster. They stared at Qiu Tong in confusion, waiting for her to explain the situation…\n“Ke Le, Shao An, please bring him to the basement and arrange for someone to keep an eye on him 24/7. Be vigilant”\n“Also, the guards outside the villa should be stationed at the most vulnerable spots…”\nQiu Tong directly ordered Shao An. Shao An looked at Jin Yang with a questioning gaze.\nJin Yang nodded in tacit agreement. Shao An immediately brought the gangster to the basement.\nQiu Tong wanted to set up a tracking system on the gangster’s phone. She typed away on her laptop to design a tracking program. Little Yu laid beside her in her adorable pajamas. She glanced at what Qiu Tong was doing in confusion, before taking over the laptop and skillfully started writing some code.\nQiu Xingyu’s proficiency far exceeded Qiu Tong’s. The program she designed was even more meticulous than Qiu Tong’s.\nShe was indeed a future big-time hacker!\nQiu Tong rubbed the top of Qiu Xingyu’s head and kissed her cheek to encourage her.\nYe Luan’s eyes darkened as he clenched his fists hesitantly.\nFaced with concern for the Qiu family, he had no choice but to tell them the truth. “I have what they want. As long as they don’t get it, they will continue to chase after me.”\n“I can’t trouble you anymore. Auntie Qiu, thank you. I better go.”\nYe Luan stood up and bowed deeply in Qiu Tong’s direction.. He bit his lips stubbornly, his voice choked with emotion.",

      "content": "Chapter 238: Setting Up An Ambush\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nQiu Tong looked lovingly at the sensible and patient Ye Luan. He was obviously afraid and vulnerable, but he stubbornly chose to face his troubles alone.\nQiu Xingyu opened her arms and blocked the door. Her eyes were filled with tears as she said, “You’re not allowed to leave!”\nQiu Tong grabbed Ye Luan’s wrist and pulled him into her arms. She used a gentle voice to placate Ye Luan. “We will help you solve the danger you face. This is your home, a harbor where you can seek shelter from the outside world.”\nQiu Tong saw that Ye Luan didn’t say anything else. She looked up at Jin Yang. “Those people definitely won’t just hire two or three gangsters.”\n“I’m guessing that there will be other thugs lying in ambush around. They’re just not as stupid as that gangster in the basement. We haven’t noticed them…”\nQiu Xingyuan looked at the pitch-black darkness outside and said in an exceptionally calm voice, “Actually, we can set a trap to lure them in.”\nSince the other party was anxious to get what Ye Luan had hidden, they could use this to their advantage to control the situation.\nQiu Xingyu carried the laptop over. She sat on the ground and tapped on it. “Mommy! I’ll transfer all the surveillance cameras nearby to this laptop and design an analysis and an automatic alarm system.”\n“The moment any suspicious movements or dangerous weapons appear on the screen, the program will alert the police!”\nQiu Xingyu lifted her chin proudly, waiting for Qiu Tong to praise her.\nQiu Xingqiao swiftly moved some sandbags and wooden posts to block the door and window at the bottom of the building. “It’s safe now!”\nQiu Xingyuan held his sketchbook and quietly sketched on the sofa.\nAfter a long time, he handed a complicated-looking map to Qiu Tong. “Uncle Ke Le, please set up roadblocks at the main intersection. Also, set up the electric fence in the garden and the outer wall. This way, no matter how many enemies try to break through, they will be captured by us.”\nQiu Tong blinked in shock. She had not expected the three children to be so clear and decisive in the face of danger.\nTheir arrangements were even better than her and Jin Yang’s.\nWait a minute! Why were their eyes shining with excitement?\nQiu Tong nodded at Ke Le, indicating for him to follow Qiu Xingyuan’s plan. She lowered her head and pushed Ye Luan’s luggage back to his room.\nIn the bedroom, Qiu Tong took out the clothes from the luggage and hung them in the closet.\nYe Luan stood beside her like a helpless little animal. He wanted to open his mouth several times but swallowed his words.\nQiu Tong sensed his nervousness and gratitude. She teased him in a relaxed tone, “You’re still a child.”\n“Running away from home only with a bunch of thin clothes?”\n“Outside, money is what you need the most! Otherwise, where do you plan to stay tonight? Under the bridge beside Qingshui River?”\n“It’s very cold there. There will be other tramps coming to snatch your territory. Your arms and legs are so weak. How can you win?”\nYe Luan listened in confusion, “Auntie Qiu, have you… lived there before?”\nQiu Tong paused as she tidied her bed. She recalled her experience in the post-apocalyptic era…\nShe competed with zombies for food every day. Qiu Tong shook her head and smiled. “Of course not. I saw it on television.”\n“Do you need me to sleep with you? Let me tell you a story, okay? Little Yu especially likes to hear me tell fairy tales.”\nQiu Tong found two children’s books and gestured for Ye Luan to come over.\nIt was rare for Ye Luan to behave so shyly. He laid beside Qiu Tong in his pajamas.\nThe door handle turned and the three children staggered in at the same time. Qiu Xingqiao was still hunched over in an eavesdropping position. Qiu Xingyuan stood awkwardly at the door tidying the hem of his light blue pajamas. Little Yu rushed to Qiu Tong’s side and pleaded coquettishly, “Mommy! Little Yu wants to hear it too…”\n“Eldest Brother and Second Brother both want you to accompany them also. You can’t be biased towards Brother Ye Luan!”\nQiu Tong burst out laughing. She saw Ye Luan taking the initiative to give up his seat beside her and patted the edge of the bed helplessly. “Alright.”\nQiu Tong’s voice was very gentle. Slowly, the children closed their eyes and fell asleep.\nJin Yang quietly walked to the door. Qiu Tong put her index finger to her lips and the two of them carried the children back to their own rooms.\nKe Le and Shao An were well-coordinated. The security arrangements outside the courtyard were already prepared.\nQiu Tong stood at the entrance and looked at the red rising sun. “I’ve checked the other party’s details, but they didn’t leave any traces.”\nShe looked up at Jin Yang, hinting at him.\nOnly high-ranking officials and special organizations could do such a thing.\nEither way, it meant that Ye Luan had a deep secret! And that he was in an extremely dangerous situation…\nJin Yang hugged Qiu Tong’s shoulder and said firmly, “Don’t worry, I’m here.”\nIn a room in the S City hotel, a man wearing a golden mask was wearing a black robe. He pressed the voice changer device on his neck and dialed a few numbers.. The moment the call went through, he said, “The operation will begin at sunset.”",

Qiu Tong led Ke Le and the other mercenaries to surround the net trap with guns.\nQiu Xingyuan pressed the lift button and the net trap slowly descended.\nQiu Tong frowned in confusion when she saw the familiar figure. “Lin Shan?”\nQiu Xingyu and Qiu Xingqiao blocked the door with disappointed expressions. Shao An retreated to the back with the president.\nLin Shan was in a sorry state. She stamped her feet and shook off the mud covering her body. She glared at Qiu Tong resentfully.\nThe attempted kidnapping of the Qiu family children failed. Shu Xian’s factory was facing suspension, and Mayor Shen was putting pressure on them on behalf of a high-ranking government official.\nShu Xian had been exceptionally irritable recently. From time to time, he would drink excessively and beat Lin Shan up.\nLin Shan blamed everything on Qiu Tong. She had stolen a few bottles of paint and harmful chemicals from the weapons factory. She had wanted to spray red paint on the outer wall of the Qiu family’s villa so that the surrounding neighbors could see it. She wanted to embarrass Qiu Tong!\nHowever, Lin Shan did not expect to be strung up in a net the moment she sneaked in.\nQiu Tong crossed her arms and looked at Lin Shan coldly. Her tone was exasperated and mocking. “Shao An, please hand her over to the police.”\n“Lin Shan broke into a house with harmful chemicals. She’ll probably be in custody for a few months.”\nShao An immediately called the police chief. When Lin Shan heard their conversation, she panicked and hurriedly retorted, “Do you have evidence?”\n“I was just passing by.”\nQiu Tong pointed at the surveillance camera under the streetlamp and explained kindly, “Your crime was recorded. Explain it to the police.”\nKe Le ran out of the room and looked at Qiu Tong. “Someone’s calling!”\nQiu Tong realized that it was the gangster’s phone. She ignored Lin Shan and ran over. The children and Ye Luan were already gathered in the living room. They held their breaths and stared nervously at the tracking system.\nThe phone rang three times before Qiu Tong called back.\nBeep beep—The call went through. Qiu Xingyu immediately typed on her computer keyboard to track and lock onto the location of the caller. Qiu Tong gestured for the gangster to stall for time.\nThe gangster’s voice was hoarse. “Boss, I still need a few days.”\nThere was a long pause on the other end. An ear-piercing electric current rang out. The voice that had been processed by the voice changer sounded strange and terrifying. “Ye Luan, are you listening?”\n“Someone will be coming to get you tonight.”\n“Your little traps are so childish. They can’t stop me.”\nYe Luan clenched his fists and shouted into the phone, “I won’t let you succeed…”\nQiu Tong’s hairs stood on end. She covered Ye Luan’s mouth with her hand, trying to control his agitation.\nThis call was like a pitch-black abyss that engulfed everyone in the living room. Qiu Tong’s scalp felt numb, as if there were two pairs of eyes secretly peeping at them. Jin Yang frowned and walked to Qiu Xingyu’s side to look at the screen. “How is it?”\nQiu Xingyu’s palms were covered in sweat. She shook her head and pointed at the flashing codes on the screen.\n“The call was too short. I could only track that the other party is in S City. Then, he discovered me and I lost the trail.”\nQiu Xingyu pouted in frustration. This was the first time she had experienced defeat.\nJin Yang bent over and hugged her. “You have already done an amazing job.”\nAs the youngest hacker in the country, Qiu Xingyu’s skills were considered outstanding in the industry.\nHaving been coaxed, Qiu Xingyu smiled brightly. She raised two fingers and waved them. “Although he escaped my tracking, I planted a virus code on him.”\n“I designed that code. No anti-virus software will detect it.”\n“The moment the other party calls any number on his phone, my program will start automatically and record all the other party’s calls.”\nQiu Xingyu looked at Qiu Tong proudly. Qiu Xingyuan narrowed his eyes. “How do we listen in on them?”\nEveryone looked at Qiu Xingyu expectantly. She lowered her head and touched the tip of her nose with her hand, muttering guiltily, “We’ll be able to hear after we get his phone. The original intention of my program was to eavesdrop on Mommy’s conversation with Uncle Jin Yang.”\n“So I didn’t design it to include cloud transfer…”\nQiu Tong was amused by her and sighed deeply.\nShao An rushed in from outside. “Sir, according to the location clues provided by Miss Qiu Tong and Little Yu, we have tracked the other party to a hotel apartment in the center of S City. According to the front desk, there has been a strange man checking in recently. The car is already prepared and we set off at any time.”\nQiu Tong looked at Jin Yang in surprise. She planned to go along with him.\nThe children were also clamoring to go too. Qiu Tong asked Ke Le to stay at home to accompany them.\nIn the car, Qiu Tong stole a glance at Jin Yang’s profile and asked hesitantly, “How did you guess that he was at the hotel?”\n“I interrogated the person locked in the basement last night. From his description, I can sense the other party has a pretty high status.”\n“Such people won’t stay in basements or residential buildings, so I sent Shao An to check the registration information of all high-end hotel apartments in S City.”\nJin Yang smiled as he held Qiu Tong’s hand and rubbed his thumb against her fingertips.",

      "content": "Chapter 240: Chen Jia Comes To Stay\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nOn the top floor of S City hotel, Jin Yang shielded Qiu Tong behind him and nodded at Shao An. “Let’s begin.”\nThe entire hotel had been surrounded. All the entrances and exits of the hotel were strictly guarded by the presidential guards. Shao An led his team to break open the door of the suite and charged in. Everyone searched every room with guns, but they did not find any suspicious persons.\nThere were two bottles of red wine and champagne on the coffee table in the living room. The remnants of a cigar in the crystal ashtray was still burning.\nQiu Tong turned back. “He probably left a few minutes before we arrived at the hotel.”\nJin Yang frowned. Their operation this time was extremely secretive and last minute. No one should have been able to obtain any information in advance.\nHowever, the other party was able to leave first, as if he was deliberately provoking them.\nQiu Tong gritted her teeth, wanting to find some clues about the other party in the suite. A guard found clues in the bathroom and ran out to report.\nJin Yang and Qiu Tong rushed over. Looking at the phone and satellite communication devices soaked in the toilet bowl, she reached out to pick them up.\nShao An opened a sealed bag and took the initiative to take the phone away.\nQiu Tong instructed solemnly, “You must repair it!”\nRing ring—Qiu Tong want try to find some hair or other evidence in the hotel bedroom. When she heard the phone ring, she picked it up and heard Ke Le’s nervous voice coming from the other end. “Boss, come back quickly.”\n“A lady who calls herself Chen Jia is outside. She wants to see Jin Yang.”\nQiu Tong looked at Jin Yang and frowned slightly. She hung up the phone and asked, “Who’s Chen Jia?”\nJin Yang’s movements froze for a moment. After learning about the situation in the villa, he handed the hotel matter over to Shao An and rushed back with Qiu Tong.\nIn the car on the way back, Jin Yang gripped the steering wheel silently.\nHis phone kept vibrating. Qiu Tong rolled down the window and tilted her head to look at the night view outside.\nJin Yang cleared his throat and answered the call. He grunted in a perfunctory manner a couple of times before hanging up and explaining, “It’s my father.”\nQiu Tong recalled Jin Tao and nodded.\nThe two of them returned to the villa and saw Chen Jia standing in the courtyard in a simple white dress. Ke Le stood guard at the door and didn’t let her in.\nKe Le saw Qiu Tong and hurriedly ran up to her to explain the situation.\nQiu Tong said to Jin Yang, “I want to take a walk around outside. You guys can chat.”\nJin Yang opened his mouth to try and explain, but in the end, he could only nod. He strode over to Chen Jia and they whispered to each other. Chen Jia smiled brightly and sweetly. She took the initiative to hold Jin Yang’s elbow.\nQiu Tong felt a surge of frustration and turned around.\nKe Le could tell that there was something not quite right going on between Jin Yang and Chen Jia. He followed Qiu Tong closely. “Boss, if you want, I can help you chase that woman away!” His goofy expression made Qiu Tong’s gloominess dissipate a little.\nQiu Tong sat on a bench in the park and gestured for Ke Le to sit down.\nAlthough Ke Le and Qiu Tong had a contractual relationship, he treated Qiu Tong as his leader and prioritized her needs and feelings over everything.\nQiu Tong looked up at the bright moonlight and asked indifferently, “Do you think we’re alike?”\nKe Le paused. To be honest, he did mistake Chen Jia for Qiu Tong in the first few seconds.\nAfter all, Chen Jia was 80% similar to Qiu Tong in terms of appearance, but their personalities were very different. Ke Le was wondering how he should comfort her when Jin Yang walked over. He left with a knowing look, giving Jin Yang and Qiu Tong some time alone.\nJin Yang stood in front of Qiu Tong, who looked up at him. Their gazes met.\nJin Yang took off his jacket and draped it over her. “I might need you to tidy up a room and let her stay for a few days.”\nQiu Tong retorted with a laugh, “Why should I? My family isn’t a shelter.”\n“You want me to let a woman move in with us, someone whom I don’t know at all, just because you say so? Don’t forget, you are the one staying at my house!”\n“Jin Yang, get this straight. In my house, you’re not the president. You have no right to order me around!”\nQiu Tong stood up. Jin Yang grabbed her elbow and pulled her into his arms.\nHe placed his hand on the back of Qiu Tong’s head and sighed. “I know, but there’s no other way…”\n“Chen Jia has nothing to do with me, but she came to me with a hospital report.”\n“She is suffering from severe separation disorder and needs someone to take care of and accompany her. Father asked her to come and seek refuge with me. If anything happens to her, I will be held responsible.”\n“And I feel that her appearance is very strange. It’s as if someone is deliberately pushing her to us. Instead of letting Chen Jia become a hidden bomb that can explode at any time, it’s better to keep her by our side. Even if she wants to do something, it will be easy to deal with her where we can see her.”\nJin Yang patiently persuaded Qiu Tong.\nQiu Tong felt a fire burning in her heart, but she could not vent it.",

      "content": "Chapter 241: Temporary Guest\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nIn the villa, Qiu Tong and Jin Yang brought Chen Jia back. Chen Jia followed Jin Yang closely, looking extremely insecure.\nQiu Tong showed her the guest room at the back with a dark expression. “You can stay here for the time being. If you need anything, tell Ke Le…”\nQiu Xingyu heard movement outside. She ran out holding a colorful egg that the kindergarten teacher had drawn with her. She was so excited to show off her masterpiece to Qiu Tong. However, when she saw Chen Jia, who seemed to have been carved out from the same mold as her mother, she stopped in surprise.\nQiu Xingyu was so frightened that she could not speak. She hurriedly ran back into the room and dragged Qiu Xingyuan, Ye Luan and the rest out.\nThe children looked at Chen Jia in a daze, their gazes wandering between her and Qiu Tong.\nThey all had the same thought. Did their mother have a twin?\nChen Jia squatted down and approached Qiu Xingyu with a gentle smile. “Did you make this yourself? It’s so beautiful.”\n“You guys are so cute. I didn’t expect Miss Qiu to be the mother of so many children at such a young age.”\nChen Jia rubbed the top of Qiu Xingyu’s head and wanted to pinch her chubby face, but Qiu Xingyu frowned and took two steps back. Her eyes were filled with vigilance and disgust as she snatched the colorful egg back. “Who are you? Why are you in our house?”\nChen Jia looked very gentle and wasn’t fierce at all.\nHowever, the children instinctively hated her. Their eyes were filled with hostility.\nChen Jia seemed to be frightened by Qiu Xingyu’s actions and attitude. She walked to Jin Yang’s side and looked at him pleadingly.\nQiu Tong said, “She’ll be living with us for the time being. You guys have to behave.”\nQiu Xingyuan shrugged. “Did Mommy rent out the guest room? But this has to be approved by us!”\nQiu Xingqiao nodded. “We are usually very noisy. This auntie might not be able to accept it.”\nAuntie?! Chen Jia couldn’t keep a straight face. She tugged at Jin Yang’s clothes and asked in a soft voice, “Brother Yang, don’t they like me?”\nQiu Xingyuan ridiculed bluntly, “We don’t even know each other. There’s no reason to like strangers, right?”\nQiu Tong hugged Qiu Xingyuan and Little Yu and said in a low voice, “You cannot be rude.”\nShe looked at Jin Yang and her gaze landed on his arm. “Since she is your friend, you take care of her.”\nQiu Tong returned to the second floor exhausted.\nJin Yang pushed Chen Jia’s hand away and carried her luggage to the guest room with a cold expression. He didn’t stay for long before leaving.\nChen Jia closed the door and looked around the room. Her expression changed from gentle to cold.\nShe dialed Jin Tao’s number and sat by the bed, whispering, “I’ve already successfully moved in. There’s a rift between Qiu Tong and him…”\nJin Tao nodded in satisfaction. “Alright, let’s achieve our goal as soon as possible.”\n…\nIn the bedroom, Qiu Tong was about to change into more comfortable clothes. She stood in front of the wardrobe and heard footsteps coming from behind.\nJin Yang held her shoulders and turned her to look into his eyes.\nHis thin lips curled into a subtle smile. Jin Yang used his fingertips to lift a loose strand of hair at Qiu Tong’s temple and smoothed it behind her ear. “Are you jealous?”\nQiu Tong refused to admit it. She did not know when Jin Yang had become so important to her.\nJin Yang hooked his arm around her waist, before slowly moving it downwards. The temperature in the bedroom gradually rose.\nQiu Tong’s back was sweating profusely. She frowned and pushed Jin Yang’s chest. “You should go take care of her…”\nJin Yang’s large palm covered her waist, seeking out Qiu Tong’s sensitive area. He moved closer in a low and hoarse voice, his eyes filled with helplessness as he coaxed, “You’re the only one I want to take care of! Besides, I want to bring you somewhere else for a good chat.”\nJin Yang suddenly picked Qiu Tong up and threw her onto the bed.\nQiu Tong frowned. She looked at Jin Yang, who was crawling over like a predator. She bent her knees to push against his chest.\nJin Yang placed his hand on her smooth leg and pulled her toward him. He pinned Qiu Tong under him and swiftly spread her legs. “Don’t forget that we’re legally married…”\nQiu Tong wanted to grab Jin Yang’s wrist, but she gritted her teeth and reminded him, “It’s just a marriage on paper.”\nJin Yang grabbed her arm and threw the pillow aside. He adjusted his position and leaned on her. His thin lips moved closer to Qiu Tong’s ear, deliberately blowing hot air to arouse her. “But this relationship is legally recognized.”\n“If it’s against my will, I can sue in court…”\nQiu Tong tried her best to break free from his control, muttering vicious words.\nIn the next second, Jin Yang kissed the tender flesh of her neck. His fingertips moved nimbly between Qiu Tong’s legs. He dipped his fingertips into her moisture before bringing it before her eyes. He chuckled and said, “But that’s not what your body says.”\n“Your body is far more honest than your mouth.”\nJin Yang sighed and bent over to kiss Qiu Tong’s red lips..",

Qiu Tong had no choice but to obey.\nShe hooked her arms around Jin Yang’s shoulders and wrapped her slender legs around his waist.\nJin Yang panted heavily. Just as he was about to enter her, someone knocked on the door.\nQiu Tong’s eyes instantly cleared up and the heated atmosphere was interrupted. Chen Jia’s voice came from outside. “Brother Yang, there seems to be a problem with the air conditioning in my room. Can you help me take a look?”\nJin Yang took a deep breath. Seeing that Chen Jia had no intention of leaving, Qiu Tong raised her leg and kicked Jin Yang’s waist.\nShe looked at Jin Yang with a dark expression. “Hurry up and help your Chen Jia.”\nQiu Tong walked into the bathroom and closed the door.\nJin Yang scratched his head in frustration. He walked to the door in his pajamas. When Chen Jia saw him, her eyes were filled with surprise. “Am I disturbing you?”\nIn the bathroom, Qiu Tong listened to their conversation. She was so angry that her scalp went numb. She wished she could go out and expose Chen Jia’s fake identity.\nJin Yang closed the door gently and Chen Jia stole a glance inside.\nThe messy bed sheets and the scent of love in the air were difficult to conceal. Qiu Tong’s kiss mark was still on Jin Yang’s neck.\nChen Jia narrowed her eyes silently and followed Jin Yang closely. In a light voice, she said, “I think Miss Qiu seems to hate me very much. Did I do something wrong? If I am causing trouble in your lives, I can find a place to move out tomorrow.”\n“It’s alright with Uncle Jin Tao. Don’t worry, I’ll explain on your behalf.”\nChen Jia lowered her head as she said those words. Jin Yang called Ke Le and the other mercenaries over. They went to Chen Jia’s room to check the air conditioner and found that it was just that the remote control did not have a battery. Ke Le stared at Chen Jia with a meaningful look. “It’s just a small matter. There’s a brand new battery in the drawer.”\n“Even if you can’t handle it yourself, you can ask us for help. You don’t have to bother Boss and the rest, right?”\nKe Le’s tone was filled with annoyance. Chen Jia tugged at the corner of her clothes nervously. She bit her lips and didn’t answer.\nJin Yang shook his head at Ke Le and left after giving Chen Jia a few instructions. When he returned to Qiu Tong’s room, he realized that the door had been locked from the inside. He knocked on the door several times but did not hear any reply. A pillow and blanket had been thrown in the corridor. Jin Yang sighed and carried his things to the guest room next door. He took out his phone and sent a message to Qiu Tong, but she did not reply.\nLate at night, Qiu Tong stared at her phone screen several times. She flipped open her laptop in frustration.\nThe information found on the phone in the hotel had been recovered and sorted out. Qiu Tong checked the details sent to her.\nThe program designed by Qiu Xingyu had indeed recorded the contents of the calls for about 10 seconds. The voice changer made the conversation difficult to hear. Qiu Tong turned the volume to the maximum and could vaguely hear him say, “There’s been a change in the plan. We can’t let them know.”\nQiu Tong’s thoughts were in a mess. She grabbed a piece of paper and scribbled on it.\nWho were they? What did they know?\nYe Luan could shed light on many of the questions, but Qiu Tong didn’t want to force him, so the situation was in a stalemate…\nThat night, Qiu Tong stared at the ceiling. She slept for a few hours before the sun rose outside the window.\nAt nine in the morning, Qiu Tong walked out of the room looking exhausted. She planned to make a nutritious breakfast for the children. When she reached the kitchen door, she saw that Chen Jia was already busy inside. There were egg tarts and butter cake in the electric oven, and a nutritious porridge was cooking in the pot. Chen Jia even made jam and cheese sandwiches, completely upgrading the family’s breakfast.\nQiu Tong stood at the entrance, silently watching her.\nCheng Jia heard some noise and turned. She gave a brilliant smile. Ms Qiu, you are up?”\n“I was just about to wake you all up. I didn’t know if you guys liked Chinese or Western breakfast, so I prepared a bit of each.”\nQiu Tong frowned as she watched her carrying out the hot milk.\nChen Jia noticed her gaze and smiled. Her eyes were filled with lingering affection as she said, “Brother Yang has a sensitive stomach. If he doesn’t drink some warm milk for breakfast, he’ll suffer from stomach pains the rest of the day. This is specially prepared for him. If you like, I can make you another cup.”\nChen Jia opened the drawer and found the cheese and jam.\nQiu Tong asked in a low and hoarse voice, “How did you know those things were there?”\nChen Jia paused for a moment. “Because I have the same habit. In the past, I liked to keep random things in the second drawer. I forgot that this is your home. I didn’t expect our habits to be so similar.” Her seemingly casual words reminded Qiu Tong of Jin Yang’s familiarity with the kitchen.\nWith so many clues and coincidences pieced together, it was inevitable that Qiu Tong would come to certain conclusions.\nJin Yang came out of the guest room and hugged Qiu Tong by the waist. “Can you let me return to your room tonight?”\n“The guest room next door is very cold. I can’t sleep without you.”\nJin Yang spoke those sweet words in an especially natural manner, not caring that there was another person in the kitchen.\nHearing their conversation, Chen Jia’s fingers instantly turned red when they touched the edge of the milk pot.",

      "content": "Chapter 243: Torture and Interrogation\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nThe dining room was a little quiet.\nThe children sized up Chen Jia and Jin Yang. Qiu Xingyu glared at Jin Yang with a condemning expression. She held her chopsticks and poked at the bread on her plate. Jin Yang coughed lightly and pushed a glass of milk over. Out of spite, she looked away and ignored him.\nSeeing that the atmosphere was not right, Chen Jia took the initiative to give Qiu Xingyuan two slices of bacon. “Hope you will like my cooking.”\nQiu Xingyuan immediately transferred the bacon to Ke Le, who was sitting opposite him. He said with a cold gaze, “I don’t like to eat food made by strangers.”\nQiu Xingqiao nodded in agreement.\nQiu Tong was very pleased by the children’s clear stance. But she tried to smooth things over. “You have to be polite and respect our guest.”\nGuest? Qiu Xingyuan glanced at Chen Jia coldly. This woman clearly had designs on Jin Yang!\nAfter breakfast, Chen Jia took the initiative to play with the children. But no matter where she went, the children would immediately stand up and walk away.\nChen Jia stood rooted to the ground in embarrassment. She turned around and looked at Jin Yang. Just as she was about to walk over and complain to him, Qiu Xingqiao passed by the middle of the living room on a skateboard and nearly bumped into Chen Jia. She lost her balance and fell to the ground. She hit her wrist against the floor tile and it immediately became swollen.\nQiu Xingqiao stood in front of her with a skateboard in hand. He bowed and apologized in a perfunctory manner. “Sorry, Auntie.”\nAuntie?! Chen Jia was shocked by Qiu Xingqiao’s address.\nQiu Xingyuan brought over some ointment and carefully treated her injury.\nSensing that his attitude towards her had changed, Chen Jia asked him, “You’re the little genius who developed the locust pesticide, right? I’ve seen you in the news. You’re really steady and reliable…”\nQiu Xingyuan quietly kept the ointment. “It’s just a mild injury.”\n“Auntie, you don’t have to look for Uncle Jin Yang to treat it. If it hurts, you can just ask us for help. After all, we’ve all learned how to treat such injuries in kindergarten. We can definitely help you.”\nQiu Xingyuan’s subtle ridicule was so profound that Chen Jia felt rather humiliated.\nKe Le was like a loudspeaker. He had already told everyone what happened the previous night. Everyone could see her true agenda.\nChen Jia frowned. She didn’t expect things to go so wrong.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao returned to the sofa in the living room. Little Yu took out two lollipops as if she was performing a magic trick and stuffed them into their hands.\n“Eldest Brother, Second Brother! You guys are awesome!”\nQiu Xingyuan tore open the wrapping paper and bit into the apple-flavored lollipop, staring at Chen Jia.\nQiu Xingyu called them over and the three children gathered together to discuss how to deal with Chen Jia.\nQiu Xingqiao snorted. “She wants to snatch Uncle Jin Yang away? Impossible!”\nQiu Xingyu clenched her fists. “It wasn’t easy for us to have a Daddy. We can’t let him go, or Mommy will be very sad.”\nIn the bedroom, Jin Yang suddenly sneezed twice. He had no idea who was secretly discussing him behind his back.\n…\nIn the basement, the gangster who attacked Ye Luan was lying on the ground with a sallow face.\nIn the darkness, he vaguely saw a figure walking towards the door. “Help! I really don’t know anything!”\nIn his dying state, the gangster probably really wasn’t hiding anything.\nQiu Tong could not be bothered to waste any more time with him. Just as she was about to instruct Shao An to send him to the police station, the gangster muttered in a daze, “They’ll silence me! I really didn’t see…”\nWait! Qiu Tong’s eyes suddenly lit up.\nAll the lights in the basement were turned on in an instant. The gangster had been in a dark environment for a long time, and the sudden lights temporarily blinded him.\nQiu Tong grabbed his collar and said, “Tell me the truth!”\nThe gangster was tense and nervous, and he bit the tip of his tongue, unwilling to say another word.\nShao An heard the commotion. He was afraid that Qiu Tong would be in danger so he rushed in. Qiu Tong explained to him briefly, and Shao An said with a knowing expression, “Miss Qiu, please go out for a moment. I’ll pry open his mouth.”\nQiu Tong wanted to stay behind, but Jin Yang held her waist and walked out. “Don’t worry, leave it to Shao An.”\nWhen the two of them reached the door, they heard wails coming from the basement.\nThe gangster’s tragic cries spread throughout the entire villa. Shao An pulled off his belt and stuffed a cloth into his mouth.\nQiu Tong wanted to rush in after hearing the muffled groans and the sounds of blood being splattered. Jin Yang held her wrist and shook his head gently. “Shao An has been my bodyguard for many years. Although he appears to be very refined, his methods are ruthless. No one can hide any secrets from him.”\nJin Yang raised his wristwatch and calculated the time.\nThe gangster did not last more than two and a half minutes. Shao An strode out of the basement and nodded respectfully at Jin Yang and Qiu Tong. “He’s willing to explain now.”\nThe basement reeked of blood and the gangster was covered in blood.\nHe raised his head weakly and looked at Qiu Tong with eyes filled with despair. “I’ll tell you everything. Please give me a quick death!”\n“You met them, right?”\nQiu Tong voiced her suspicion. The gangster lowered his head slowly.. “Yes.”",

      "content": "Chapter 244: Enemy Information\n“We do business in the dark. Employers mostly want us to kill and rob people for money. The other tasks are about revenge.”\nThe gangster coughed and spat out two mouthfuls of blood. His expression was self-deprecating. “Employers all have high status in society and don’t want their hands to be covered in blood. Our lives are cheap. We hide in the dark and be their knives for them, helping them solve their problems.”\n“It’s common for employers to hide their identities, but when I received this deal, I instinctively felt that something was amiss.”\nThe gangster looked at Qiu Tong and waved his fingers weakly. “Can I have a cigarette?”\nJin Yang nodded at Shao An. Shao An lit a cigarette and stuffed it between his fingers. After taking two deep breaths, he regained his composure and continued to recall his strange experience that night. “The voice on the phone was clearly processed. They said that as long as I kidnap the child, they will give me a seven-digit fee.”\n“And they can create a new identity for me so that I can leave the black market and be an ordinary person.”\nThe gangster’s hands were trembling. He clasped them together and before placing the cigarette in his mouth.\n“I was suspicious at the time. Someone who can create a fake identity must be a high-ranking official or someone with power! Why would they kidnap a child?”\n“They probably knew that I didn’t really believe them. Without asking for my bank account information, they transferred a deposit of $15,000 to my account. I was shocked and asked if they weren’t afraid that I would run away with the money. They said that they would be able to find me no matter where I went…”\nThese threats made the gangster afraid. He knew that he had gotten himself into something nasty, so he had no choice but to agree to the other party’s request.\nQiu Tong had investigated the gangster in front of her in advance. He had a reputation in the black market. It was said that he had a wide network and sinister methods.\nHe had never failed a mission before.\nPerhaps this was the reason why the other party chose him… but they did not expect the gangster to fail with Ye Luan.\nThe gangster quickly finished his cigarette and crushed it with his foot. “While I was looking for traces of that child, I was also looking for my employer. I wanted to know who they were, but as you can see, they are very vigilant. The numbers they used to call me were all fake, and their voices cannot not be identified.”\n“But on one call, I heard the whistle of a cruise ship in the background.”\n“I have a lot of connections. According to the time and date of that call, I searched for the harbor and cruise ship. There was a particular pier that aroused my suspicion. All the surveillance footage had been deleted, but I sneaked over and found that there was a surveillance camera installed at the back of the garbage truck that collected trash there every night. I saw them there…”\nThe gangster felt a chill run down his spine. He still could not forget the effect of seeing that scene.\nIn the dark rainy night, a man wearing a long black suit had his hands in his pockets, his eyes cold and indifferent.\nHe looked on emotionlessly at the person kneeling on the ground and begging for mercy. He took out a pistol and aimed it between his brows.\nBang! The pistol was equipped with a silencer. Accompanied by the sound of thunder, no one noticed. Several bodyguards had appeared beside the man. They dragged the corpse and threw it into the sea. Their actions were so swift that even the gangster felt afraid.\n“Can you imagine? Some people have very strong auras! I could feel his aura even through the camera…”\nEven though he was a gangster who had killed many people, at that moment, he still regretted accepting the deposit from the other party.\nHe had no way of escaping now. All he could do was chase after Ye Luan and complete the mission his employer assigned him.\nThe gangster suddenly gaped. He seemed to be pulling at something from his mouth.\nQiu Tong was so nervous that she wanted Shao An to stop him. In the next second, the gangster dragged a thin thread from his throat. He retched a few times before finally pulling out a SD card stained with blood. He threw a tooth he had plucked out to the ground and handed it to Shao An along with the SD card.\n“This is the surveillance footage I copied. Although you can’t see their faces clearly…”\nShao An took it and immediately handed it to a tech staff to deal with.\nQiu Tong frowned. She hesitated for a moment before walking up to the gangster. She placed her hand on his shoulder and activated her supernatural power.\nA warm current slowly flowed into the gangster’s body. He looked up at Qiu Tong in disbelief.\n“You may have done wrong, but there will be laws to punish you. You will not die here, and you won’t die in their hands.”\nThe gangster suddenly smiled and looked at the woman in front of him. “Are you kind or cruel?”\nShe had tacitly agreed to Shao An’s torture methods and she attacked him in the black market, but she also wanted to save him and let him be punished by the law? The gangster’s eyes lost their luster. He stared at the ground quietly. “I almost caught up to them before.”\n“But I lost them in the end.”\n“They parked their car near 730 Guangming Road. You can look for them there. You might be able to find other clues.”\nThe gangster refused to speak again.\nIn order to ensure his safety, Qiu Tong arranged for the mercenaries to guard the basement door and temporarily keep him in the villa..",

They wanted to find any relevant clues as soon as possible.\nQiu Tong leaned her elbow against the window and looked at the increasingly familiar scenery outside. She frowned slightly.\nJin Yang noticed Qiu Tong’s discomfort and would occasionally turn his head to look at her. “Is there something wrong?”\nQiu Tong looked down at 730 Guangming Road displayed on the navigation system. It was actually a university campus!\nAnd this was the campus block where Professor Dong worked! Qiu Tong thought of his secret lab and the gorilla locked in the cage. When she linked all the clues she had now, she could not help arriving at a terrifying thought.\nThe car came to a stop by the road. Qiu Tong lowered her eyes and asked Jin Yang, “Do you believe that there is a drug that can change the human body?”\nJin Yang’s heart skipped a beat. He concealed his emotions and asked, “Why would you think that?”\nQiu Tong pointed at the building in front of them. “If the guy in my basement didn’t lie to us, I might know where those people went.”\n“I once accepted a bodyguard mission from the Dark Web. It was for a professor at this school. He’s developing this drug.”\nJin Yang pursed his lips, shock flashing across his eyes.\nHe did not expect to find the human modification plan here!\nHowever, that batch of drugs had already failed and been destroyed. Could Professor Dong be developing a new batch of drugs?\nAs the president, Jin Yang had been bitterly searching for the person who was secretly researching the drug, but he had no clues. He controlled his excitement and made a call. “Shao An, immediately arrange for a private plane. I want to return to the capital’s official residence.”\n“Come back with me. There are some things I want you to understand.”\nJin Yang’s eyes were firm. Qiu Tong nodded in agreement.\nIn the villa, the children were not as happy when they heard that Qiu Tong might stay overnight outside. They sat in a row on the sofa and sighed with dejected expressions. Chen Jia had eavesdropped on their conversation and wanted to know where Jin Yang and Qiu Tong had gone, but she received no answer.\nShe saw Ye Luan returning from school and knew that he was the only child who was not related to the Qiu family by blood.\nChen Jia took the initiative to run to the door and help him remove his school bag. “School is hard, right?”\nYe Luan nodded politely. Qiu Xingyu waved her arms behind Chen Jia, sending him a secret signal and message.\nIf Chen Jia wanted to sow discord between Jin Yang and Qiu Tong, she could only start with the children.\nShe pretended to unintentionally mention all the things that had happened between her and Jin Yang. As expected, the hot-tempered Qiu Xingqiao could not hold back his anger and stood up, wanting to chase Chen Jia out. Qiu Xingyuan patted Qiu Xingqiao’s shoulder, indicating for him to calm down and not fall into Chen Jia’s trap.\nKe Le and the mercenaries patrolled the perimeter of the villa to protect the children.\nSince there was no one at home, Chen Jia wanted to improve her relationship with the children. She put on a flattering smile and moved closer to Little Yu. “I heard that Little Yu knows how to design many interesting games and programs. Why don’t I play with you?”\nQiu Xingyu shook her head. She continued tapping away at her laptop, not even glancing at Chen Jia. “I don’t know anything.”\n“Elder Brother, the kindergarten teacher gave us a lot of homework that I don’t know how to do. Can you help me?”\nQiu Xingyu cleverly brought Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao back to their room and slammed the door shut.\nChen Jia stayed in the living room alone. She turned her head and saw Ye Luan. She came up with a plan and walked over. “Little kid, I heard that you and your parents got separated. Did Qiu Tong bring you back? Can I help you find your parents? No matter how well Qiu Tong treats you, she’s not your blood relative.”\nYe Luan frowned and looked at Chen Jia calmly.\n“Auntie Qiu is my family and this is my home. If you want to sow discord between me and them, please dispel this thought as soon as possible.”\n“They are very kind and were willing to take you in. I hope you can control yourself and stop imitating Auntie Qiu.”\n“Even if you can imitate her appearance, you will never be able to become her. You will only be a ridiculous replica, a substitute.”\nYe Luan’s every word was like a needle that pierced into Chen Jia’s heart.\nIn the bedroom, Qiu Xingyu was eavesdropping on the conversation outside.\nShe quietly gave a thumbs-up sign and turned around to say to Qiu Xingyuan, who was also very curious but was trying his best not to eavesdrop, “See! I knew that Brother Ye Luan was on the same side as us. He will definitely help Mommy!”\nQiu Xingyuan looked away. “At least he has some conscience.”\nQiu Xingqiao was wearing boxing gloves. He hammered the sandbag angrily. “What are we going to do?”\n“It’s best if we can chase that bad woman away while Mommy and Uncle Jin Yang are not home!”\nQiu Xingyu raised her arms in agreement. “Mommy hasn’t smiled in the past few days since that woman moved in.”\n“We can pretend to be ghosts in the middle of the night to scare her!”\nQiu Xingyu’s childish suggestion made Qiu Xingqiao’s shoulders drop.\nHe looked at his little sister’s innocent face helplessly and could not bear to rebut her.\nQiu Xingyuan recalled Chen Jia’s behavior during the past few days.. “I think she must have other motives. Why don’t we keep an eye on her and see what she wants to do!”",

      "content": "Chapter 246: Caught\nAs the night deepened, Ke Le led the mercenaries to patrol around the villa.\nChen Jia quietly pushed open the children’s bedroom door. She saw Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao lying quietly on the bed. They were sleeping exceptionally soundly.\nIn the dim environment, Chen Jia came to the second floor.\nShe took off her necklace and used the silver hook to open the lock. Chen Jia turned the door handle gently and looked around warily, seeing that there was no one around. She slipped in.\nJin Tao’s mission for her was not just to sow discord between Jin Yang and Qiu Tong, but also to monitor Jin Yang.\nChen Jia searched through the bedside table and desk drawer in the bedroom, but found no useful information.\nShe sat in front of the computer and tried to crack the password, but to no avail.\nChen Jia saw the luggage in the corner and recognized Jin Yang’s personal emblem. She planned to see if there were any secrets inside.\nClick—she had just taken two steps when she heard the sound of the door lock turning.\nQiu Xingyuan stood on his tiptoes and turned on the light on the ceiling of the bedroom. The four children looked at her coldly. “Auntie, why are you in Mommy’s room? Don’t tell me you were sleepwalking or you entered the wrong room! When you came to our room just now, we weren’t asleep!”\nYe Luan shielded the Qiu family children behind him. He held his phone and could call the police anytime.\n“What are you looking for?”\nChen Jia was a little flustered. She didn’t expect to be caught red-handed.\nMany explanations flashed across her mind, but she did not voice them out.\nQiu Xingyu stood on tip toe and stuck her head out from behind Qiu Xingqiao. She bared her little white teeth and said fiercely to Chen Jia, “I will tell Uncle Jin Yang!”\nShe pouted and said, “You want to steal something!”\nChen Jia didn’t expect these kids to be so difficult to deal with. She raised her hand and twirled her hair, narrowing her eyes and revealing a ruthless expression.\nShe slowly walked up to the children, thinking that she should have no problem dealing with them.\nAs long as she could shut them up forever, Chen Jia would naturally have a way to push the blame to the so-called bad guys. With Jin Tao’s protection, even if Jin Yang suspected her, he would not be able to detain or punish her!\nChen Jia was having evil thoughts. Ye Luan realized that something was wrong and kept retreating while protecting his younger siblings.\nQiu Xingyu’s back was pressed against the wall at the end of the corridor. She suddenly waved at a spot behind Chen Jia. “Uncle Ke Le, come and help!”\nChen Jia instinctively turned her head only to see the empty corridor behind her.\nShe had been fooled! Chen Jia wanted to grab the children, but Qiu Xingyuan and Ye Luan took advantage of her distracted state and bent over to circle around her. The children ran straight for the spiral staircase. They ran quickly, with Chen Jia chasing after them.\nIn the living room, Ke Le suddenly pushed the door open and entered.\nQiu Xingyu looked like she had seen her savior. She hid behind him with tears in her eyes. She pointed at Chen Jia and said, “She wants to harm us!”\nKe Le was originally patrolling outside. For some reason, he felt uneasy and panicked.\nHe was afraid that the children would take advantage of Qiu Tong’s absence to fool around at home. He wanted to come back and take a look, only to see this scene before him.\nKe Le put a wary hand on the gun at his waist. “What happened?”\nChen Jia immediately wiped off her vicious expression and took two steps forward apologetically. “I entered the wrong room. I didn’t expect to encounter the children. They might have some misunderstanding about me…”\nQiu Xingyu wiped her tears and gritted her teeth.\nShe shouted angrily, “You liar! You were the one who sneaked into Mommy’s room!”\nKe Le raised his head and looked at the open door of the bedroom on the second floor. He instantly took out his gun and pointed it at Chen Jia.\nBetween the children and Chen Jia, Ke Le would never choose to believe in a stranger.\nHe rested his index finger on the trigger, maintaining a shooting stance. “Please return to your room. When Boss and Mr. Jin Yang return, they will listen to your explanation and make their judgment.”\nChen Jia frowned and wanted to take a tentative step forward. Ke Le shot at the floor as a final warning.\n“Alright, I’ll listen to you.”\nChen Jia knew that it was impossible to change the situation now. She had no choice but to return to the bedroom.\n…\nAt the official residence of the capital. Jin Yang and Qiu Tong arrived in a car.\nJin Yang took two steps forward and realized that Qiu Tong wasn’t following him. He turned around and saw that Qiu Tong was still sitting in the car. He returned to her side and asked, “What’s the matter?”\nQiu Tong smiled. “I’ll wait for you here.”\nThere were many secrets inside the president’s residence. Even though Qiu Tong and Jin Yang were legally married now, she still didn’t want to have anything to do with the rich and powerful.\nQiu Tong knew that there were many problems behind those seemingly glamorous identities. She did not want to get too involved.\nJin Yang knew her well and did not force her. He brought Shao An to the office on the second floor as quickly as possible.\n“Bring out all the documents and information on the human modification plan!”\n“I need to see all the information and research labs in the shortest time possible…”\nJin Yang loosened his tie as he instructed with a frown.\nShao An was in a difficult position. “Those are all classified information of the highest grade. I have to report to Mr.. Jin Tao if I want to retrieve them…”",

Although Jin Yang seemed to have real power and many political achievements, Jin Tao was in close contact with many high-ranking officials. His spies were even hidden in the official residence, and Jin Yang’s actions were directly reported to him.\nShao An was shocked and immediately went to get the information.\nThe study room was filled with silence and an oppressive atmosphere. Jin Yang narrowed his eyes and looked at his reflection in the French windows. He slowly adjusted his breathing. Through the glass, he saw Qiu Tong sitting in the passenger seat of the SUV. A faint smile appeared on his lips as he regained his rationality.\nThe butler rushed over when he heard that the president had returned.\nHe had been taking care of Jin Yang’s daily life in the official residence. After all these years, he already treated Jin Yang as his own child.\nThe butler was holding a glass of the tea that Jin Yang usually drank. Seeing Jin Yang’s thin appearance, the butler asked with concern, “How long will you be back this time?”\nJin Yang sipped his tea and patted the butler’s shoulder apologetically. “I’m leaving tonight. Please take care of the official residence for me.”\nThe butler nodded and was about to say something when Shao An walked over quickly with the printed information.\nJin Yang and Shao An didn’t linger on and started to leave. The butler seemed to have thought of something and returned to the second floor to get a pillow. “Sir, please wait!”\nThe butler chased after Jin Yang and handed it to him. “You have never been able to sleep well outside. Since you are away so often, bring this with you!”\nJin Yang thanked the butler and gestured at Shao An to take the pillow. At this moment, Qiu Tong had received Ke Le’s call. She knew what had happened at home and wished she could fly back quickly. She pushed open the car door wanting to find Jin Yang, but the two of them bumped into each other. She grabbed Jin Yang’s arm and stuffed him into the car.\nThe butler looked at Qiu Tong’s back profile from afar and rubbed his eyes in disbelief.\nThe woman looked strangely familiar!\nShe looked very much like Jin Yang’s fiancée!\nThe butler wanted to run over and take a closer look, but the car sped away. He shook his head and muttered to himself, “Impossible, how could it be her?”\nShao An floored the accelerator and the car sped down the highway towards the airport.\nQiu Tong gave a simple description of the situation. Jin Yang’s expression was equally gloomy and terrifying, as if frost was forming on his face.\nJin Yang recalled the time when Chen Jia appeared and her strange actions. His eagle-like eyes shot out a cold glint that was terrifying.\nQiu Tong kept in constant communication with Ke Le. She asked tentatively, “What do you know about Chen Jia?”\n“Could she have been sent by some outside force and is in cahoots with those people who want to kidnap Ye Luan?”\nJin Yang shook his head, denying Qiu Tong’s judgment.\nA light rain started to fall from the sky. The constant patter of the rain irritated him.\nJin Yang clenched his fists. “If Chen Jia’s target is Ye Luan, why would she go to our bedroom to look for things?”\n“No matter what she wants to do and who sent her, we will be able to find out when we return!”\nQiu Tong stole a glance at his profile and stopped talking. A torturous silence fell over the car.\nShao An felt cold sweat trickle down his back. He gripped the steering wheel tightly and sped up.\nChen Jia had come to Jin Yang by Jin Tao’s instructions.\nDid Jin Tao know about this matter? Qiu Tong thought about her meeting with Jin Tao and wanted to mention it to Jin Yang several times, but she swallowed her words. With their own thoughts on their minds, the two of them took a flight and landed on the open parking space near the S City villa district.\nIt was already five in the morning when they rushed back to the villa.\nQiu Tong wanted to go straight to the bedroom to interrogate Chen Jia, but when she saw the children and Ke Le sitting in the living room, she immediately felt that something was wrong.\nAs expected, Ke Le stood up apologetically. “Sorry, Boss.”\n“We let her escape.”\nQiu Tong widened her eyes. She ran to the door of the guest room and saw that it was empty. Where was Chen Jia?\nThe window railings were cut by saw-shaped tools. The ropes binding Chen Jia’s wrists were also scattered on the ground. There were clear footprints of high heels on the window sill. Everything indicated that Chen Jia had escaped.\nKe Le scratched his head. He slapped himself in frustration. “We didn’t expect her to be so skilled.”\nChen Jia had always appeared so gentle in the villa so Ke Le was not too vigilant. He had arranged for a mercenary to guard outside the door, not expecting Chen Jia to escape while tied up.\nKe Le and the mercenaries waited until midnight but did not notice anything unusual. It was Qiu Xingyuan who felt that something was wrong.\nAfter they barged into the room, Chen Jia had disappeared. The mercenaries quickly searched the surroundings but still couldn’t find her.\nQiu Tong frowned, but she did not blame Ke Le and the others. She followed Jin Yang to the bedroom on the second floor to investigate.\nThe items were all in their original positions. Even the folds of the bedsheet were at their original angles and lines. It was obvious that Chen Jia was highly skilled. Jin Yang and Qiu Tong examined the room separately and found that both the computer and phone bore signs of being unlocked.\nQiu Tong met Jin Yang’s eyes and asked in a hoarse voice, “What is Chen Jia looking for?”",

      "content": "Chapter 248: Moving Overnight\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nQiu Tong thought that Chen Jia would be the key to solving all the problems and doubts, but she didn’t expect the clues to stop again.\nJin Yang changed the password and redesigned the login verification method.\nThe sun slowly rose from the east. It emitted a warm light that illuminated every corner of the room through the thick clouds.\nQiu Tong wanted to go and comfort the children. She walked to the door and Jin Yang grabbed her elbow. “Let’s talk.”\nThe two of them sat on the edge of the bed. The slew of troubles made their expressions solemn.\nJin Yang rubbed Qiu Tong’s knuckles. “We might not be able to stay in this villa anymore.”\n“We have no idea what forces are behind Chen Jia. The people who are chasing after Ye Luan might find this place at any time. Also, Lin Shan and Shu Xian, as well as the foreign forces targeting Professor Dong…”\n“Although you and Qiu Xingyuan created an electric fence as a defense mechanism, it’s still not safe for us.”\nQiu Tong agreed with him. During the famine riot, the electric fence had not been able to stop the hooligans from the neighboring city, much less an enemy with high IQ and powerful firearms. Seeing that she was not objecting, Jin Yang continued to suggest, “I have a house in S City. It’s very secretive.”\n“There are dozens of soldiers stationed there. They can protect the children.”\n“Might as well move over for now and come back when things are settled.”\nJin Yang didn’t use a commanding tone. Instead, he asked for Qiu Tong’s opinion.\nQiu Tong paused for two seconds, then nodded after a moment of hesitation. “Thank you.”\nJin Yang hugged her and comforted her gently, “I know you have feelings for this place. Believe me, you will come back soon.”\nAfter Qiu Tong and Jin Yang finished their discussion, she informed the children to pack up their things.\nKe Le wanted to go to the kindergarten to apply for leave for the children, but Qiu Tong stopped him.\nShe had two thick stacks of bills in her hand. “You’ve done very well during this period. I’m very grateful.”\n“But we might face many dangers in the future. I don’t want to implicate you. I am going to another place this time and you can take up another job from the Dark Web. It’s best to find some easy jobs. Don’t go looking for troublesome employers like me anymore.”\nKe Le looked at the envelope in his hand and refused with a frown. “Boss, it’s our fault for letting Chen Jia escape.”\n“Give us another chance. We will definitely bring her back!”\nKe Le was very emotional. His chest heaved up and down. Their conversation attracted the attention of the other mercenaries.\nQiu Tong patted his shoulder and said softly, “I’m not blaming you.”\n“You’re all my friends. I don’t want… to see you get hurt because of me!”\nKe Le finally understood what she meant. He said with a stubborn and serious expression, “We don’t have any family or relatives. We accept missions in the Dark Web just to earn a living. Our previous employers treated us as tools. No one has ever treated us like family like you!”\n“Over the past period, we’ve already treated you and the children as family!”\n“Boss, we are willing to follow you if you don’t mind. Although we can’t compare to Mr. Jin Yang’s guards, we can still help you block a bullet at critical moments.”\nKe Le’s words filled Qiu Tong with gratitude. She sighed and gave in.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao tidied up the room. They looked at their own beds reluctantly before packing up their test tubes and sandbags. “Elder Brother, I didn’t expect us to have so much luggage!”\nLittle Yu ran in with red eyes. She wiped her snot with her hand. “I can’t bear to leave. There are so many memories of us and Mommy here!”\nThis was where the whole family had breakfast together for the first time, the first time they argued, the first time they reconciled… just as they were about to leave, all these memories surged up. Even Qiu Xingyuan, who usually hid his feelings deep in his heart, started to choke up.\nQiu Xingyuan patted Little Yu’s head comfortingly. “As long as we are with Mommy, we will create many new memories in the future.”\nQiu Xingyu raised her teary eyes. “Really?”\nIn the bedroom on the top floor, Qiu Tong was checking to see if there was anything left behind.\nShe looked up and saw a dust-covered luggage on top of the bedroom closet. Qiu Tong moved a stool over and dragged it down.\nDust floated in the air. Qiu Tong coughed twice and wiped away the dust.\nThe luggage contained many toys from when Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao were very young. Qiu Tong did not recognize any of them. Qiu Rong must have packed them. She sat by the bed and slowly looked through them. When she saw some yellowing photos at the bottom of the luggage, she could not help smiling.\n“Auntie Qiu, Uncle Jin Yang asked how much longer would it take?”\nYe Luan ran in from outside. The sudden sound frightened Qiu Tong so much that she accidentally scattered the photos all over the ground.\nYe Luan hurriedly squatted down to help her tidy up.\nWhen he picked up one of the photos, he suddenly stood rooted to the ground.",

      "content": "Chapter 249: Black Chip\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\n“Auntie Qiu, what’s your relationship with him?”\nYe Luan’s voice was trembling. He grabbed Qiu Tong’s clothes and pointed at Qiu Rong with his other hand.\nHis eyes flickered with anticipation as he asked with a tight feeling in his throat.\nQiu Tong took the photo and smiled when she saw her former self leaning on Qiu Rong’s shoulder in the picture.\nThis should be one of the photos that Qiu Xingyuan and the rest had secretly hidden.\nQiu Tong sat by the bed and said with a smile, “This is my father. We look very similar, right?”\n“Unfortunately, he can’t live with us now. After a while, I’ll find a way to get him out.”\nWhen Ye Luan heard the word “father”, his body swayed.\nQiu Tong sensed that something was wrong and was about to ask when she saw Ye Luan rush to the door and lock it from the inside.\nYe Luan came back and rummaged through the drawers until he found a folding knife.\nQiu Tong did not even have time to react before he pressed the blade against his abdomen, slicing apart a layer of skin.\nYe Luan trembled in pain, but his hands did not stop. He dug the blade even deeper.\nQiu Tong was shocked and hurriedly ran to his side to stop him. However, she suddenly noticed that there was a black chip embedded in his flesh. She helped to remove the chip and then covered Ye Luan’s wound with her hand.\nShe transmitted her special ability from her palm into Ye Luan’s body.\nThe wound slowly healed and Ye Luan’s pale little face gradually regained its color.\nQiu Tong looked at the black chip and asked in a low voice, “This is what those people are looking for?”\nYe Luan nodded. Qiu Tong looked at the photo in confusion. “Why are you giving it to me?”\nOver the past few days, Qiu Tong had tried many times, but Ye Luan had gritted his teeth and refused to reveal any details. But now…\nYe Luan pointed at the photo. “Daddy told me that this thing is very important and I can’t tell anyone about it.”\n“Otherwise, not only will my life be in danger, many people will also be harmed. I’ve hesitated many times over whether to tell Auntie Qiu, but I can’t go back on my promise to Daddy…”\nYe Luan lowered his eyes. He recalled his fugitive life over the years and his eyes darkened.\nQiu Tong kept the chip and hugged Ye Luan. “Then why are you willing to give it to me now?”\nYe Luan held the photo. “It’s because of him! I saw him with Daddy before. Daddy said that he is a trustworthy person.”\n“And you are his daughter.”\nQiu Tong did not expect them to be linked in this way. She could now sense the huge secret hidden in this tiny chip.\nShe probed, “What’s in here?”\nYe Luan’s answer was as Qiu Tong had guessed. “Human modification plan.”\nSo many organizations were fighting over this plan that the government had implemented many years ago.\nQiu Tong thought of Qiu Rong, who was in prison. She could not help wondering if her father was one of them.\nKnock, knock. Someone knocked on the door. Qiu Tong and Ye Luan instantly tensed up.\nJin Yang’s voice rang out from the other side. “Are you done packing? The car is outside and ready to leave.”\nQiu Tong quickly replied, “Soon!”\nThe people in this villa were Qiu Tong’s closest loved ones and were all trustworthy. However, this matter was too important and involved many people. As a result, Qiu Tong did not dare to reveal anything without thinking it through first.\nShe looked down at Ye Luan and helped him change his bloodstained clothes. “This is a secret between us. You can’t tell anyone.”\n“Not even my children and Jin Yang, okay?”\nYe Luan nodded heavily. Although he was only a seven year old child, his intelligence level far surpassed that of an ordinary adult.\nQiu Tong smiled and hooked his little finger in a solemn oath.\n…\nOn the winding mountain road, the vehicle rocked back and forth.\nQiu Tong sat in the front passenger seat and turned around to check on the children. She met Ye Luan’s gaze and instinctively placed her hand on her own lower abdomen.\nShe had hidden the chip there and it was burning.\nQiu Tong felt as if a wide net was coming down on them. Professor Dong, Ye Luan, the foreign forces and Chen Jia. The human modification plan was like an invisible thread linking everyone together. She tilted her head and looked at Jin Yang, not knowing if she should tell him.\nQiu Tong glanced at the leather folder with the red seal beside Jin Yang.\nAs the president, how much did he know about the human modification plan?\nWhat was Jin Yang’s view about it?\nBlinding sunlight shone through the vehicle’s windscreen. Qiu Tong felt a headache coming on. She covered her face with her hands and lowered her head.\nAt this moment, many chaotic and complicated memories seemed to sweep over her, but she could not see them clearly.\nShe seemed to remember hearing Qiu Rong talking to someone…\n“Qiu Tong? Are you alright?”\nQiu Tong pursed her lips. Jin Yang held her elbow worriedly and shook it gently. He rummaged for some medicine to soothe motion sickness and handed it to her. “We will be there soon. Hang in there a little longer.”\nQiu Tong nodded. Smelling the lemon orange fragrance of the medicine, she turned to stare at Jin Yang’s profile.\n“I think we met somewhere before.”",

From the corner of his eye, he glanced at the children sitting in the row behind him. He cleared his throat and pretended to be serious. “It might be better if you tell me these things when we’re alone.” He gently pinched Qiu Tong’s knuckles, hinting at her.\nQiu Tong realized that he might have misunderstood her and hurriedly pulled her hand back. “Be serious and concentrate on driving.”\nJin Yang shrugged, his lips still curled into a smile.\nThere were guards stationed at the mountainside. When they saw Jin Yang’s car plate, they all saluted and let him pass.\nQiu Xingyu and Qiu Xingqiao leaned against the car window curiously. Everything looked fresh and interesting to them.\nA lone building stood in the deep forest, surrounded by layers of security. Shao An instructed the butler and guards to move the luggage.\nJin Yang brought the children around to familiarize themselves with the environment and let them choose their preferred rooms.\nIn the living room, Qiu Tong lowered her eyes and thought about what Ye Luan had said about Qiu Rong. She felt that there was more to the story.\nQiu Xingyuan mentioned before that Qiu Rong was a refined and educated person and was skilled in all kinds of pharmaceutical research. He was his first teacher.\nQiu Rong’s case file in prison was very vague, which was especially suspicious.\nQiu Tong pondered over Qiu Rong’s remaining prison sentence. She had originally wanted to pay money to reduce his sentence, but now she changed her mind. She wanted to investigate the truth behind Qiu Rong’s arrest. As long as she could get hold of evidence that Qiu Rong was innocent, he would be released soon.\nQiu Tong didn’t want her father to bear a crime he did not commit!\nQiu Xingqiao liked guns. He pestered the guards and kept asking them about all kinds of guns.\nQiu Xingyuan and Little Yu obediently returned to their room to pack their luggage. Jin Yang saw Qiu Tong’s solemn expression from afar. He quietly walked over to her and rested his hand on her shoulder. “What are you thinking about?”\nReacting by instinct, Qiu Tong gripped his wrist tightly and struck his throat.\nJin Yang raised his hand to block her attack. When Qiu Tong saw that it was Jin Yang, she relaxed. “Sorry.”\n“Moving to an unfamiliar environment at the last minute would make anyone tense. Let’s go, I’ll bring you to our room.”\nJin Yang sensed that something was wrong with Qiu Tong, but he didn’t probe further.\nThe two of them walked to the bedroom. The well-lit room had French windows, and beyond the bright and clean glass was a verdant forest. Under the afterglow of the setting sun, this beautiful scene was set before Qiu Tong’s eyes like an oil painting.\nJin Yang hugged her waist from behind and rested his chin on her neck.\nHe said in a low and hoarse voice, “I never expected to have such a blissful life. With my loved one and the children, life is no longer cold and lonely. It’s lively. Even though it’s a little noisy, I still feel very stable and secure.”\n“It’s absolutely safe here. Don’t worry, no one will hurt you.”\nJin Yang raised Qiu Tong’s chin and leaned over to kiss her. He traced the shape of her lips with the tip of his tongue and gently cupped her cheeks, as if he was treating her like a precious treasure. Qiu Tong turned to hug his slender waist, raising her head slightly to match Jin Yang’s actions.\nHer breathing gradually became hurried and chaotic…\nJin Yang’s hand moved along the hem of Qiu Tong’s clothes. His fingers deftly hooked the shoulder straps of her bra and pushed it down gently. His palm covered her smooth and soft breast as he kneaded it, pinching her lightly with his fingertips. Qiu Tong gasped and her body went limp.\nOutside the door, Ye Luan knocked on the door, interrupting them. “Auntie Qiu, it’s time to eat.”\nQiu Tong tidied her messy hair and pushed Jin Yang away before running down.\n…\nThe next day, Qiu Tong changed into a set of clean clothes and used a plaster to cover the hickey on her neck.\nJin Yang was buttoning his shirt. Seeing that she was about to go out, he asked, “Where are you going? Do you need my guards to escort you?”\nQiu Tong shook her head. She was still hiding the truth about Qiu Rong from Jin Yang and so replied perfunctorily, “I want to take a look at my old residence.”\nJin Yang thought that the packing up of her things yesterday must have triggered the sealed memories in Qiu Tong’s mind, so he didn’t probe further.\nQiu Tong drove to her old residence. The wooden door was covered in spiderwebs. She went to the place where she used to live, and rummaged around the drawers and cupboards to search for evidence that could help Qiu Rong. However, after an entire morning of work, she found nothing but a few bills.\n“Did he not hide his things here?”\nQiu Tong tried to recall the memories related to Qiu Rong, but realized that they were blank.\nShe sat in the rattan chair in frustration as the sun outside shone on the sofa.\nThrough the rays of light, Qiu Tong realized that there seemed to be something stuffed into a gap. She hurriedly stood up and pulled out a photo with some difficulty.\nQiu Tong’s heart surged when she finally flipped the photo over. Her hands trembled uncontrollably.\nThe yellowing photo showed her in a wedding dress, and the man beside her was Jin Yang!\nQiu Tong looked at the red mole on the man’s body carefully and confirmed that she was not mistaken. But she had no memories of this at all.\nQiu Tong’s palms were sweating. So she was the woman who had once been engaged to Jin Yang!?",

The lights in the villa were switched on, and the children’s laughter could be heard from afar.\nShe stood quietly in the courtyard, her brows furrowed as she tried to get rid of the complicated and absurd thoughts in her mind.\nKe Le and the mercenaries were out on patrol. They were stunned to see her. They called out. “Boss, you’re back!”\nQiu Xingyu gave a big grin and ran into her arms. She hugged her waist and raised her head coquettishly.\nJin Yang, Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao stood at the entrance. Qiu Tong forced a smile and entered with Little Yu in her arms.\nThe light in the living room was warm, but her emotions were a little gloomy.\nJin Yang narrowed his eyes and frowned. Sensing the abnormality in her eyes, the two of them maintained a tacit understanding not to talk about it first.\nLate at night, the children went to get ready for bed. Jin Yang held her wrist and brought her back to the bedroom.\nOutside the window was a tranquil forest. Jin Yang hugged her from behind and placed his chin on her neck. “Don’t keep things in your heart. You can try to rely on me. Believe me. Can you tell me? Where did you go today?”\nQiu Tong closed her eyes and hesitated for a moment before pushing Jin Yang away. She took out the photo and asked, “Do you remember?”\nJin Yang stared at the wrinkled photo. When he realized that the photo was of him and Qiu Tong, his deep eyes flickered with shock.\nQiu Tong stared intently at his expression and knew that Jin Yang was in the same situation as her.\n“We both have a blank in our memories. What happened during that time and what our relationship was, we have no idea. Jin Yang, we’re adults. We can’t come to a conclusion just because of this photo. You should understand what I mean.”\nQiu Tong’s voice was trembling, but her tone was exceptionally firm.\nJin Yang’s eyes flashed with pain as he sat by the bed. He felt waves of stinging pain from his temples again. He rubbed his forehead to resist the tugging sensation from the depths of his soul. It was as if some blurry memories were there but always just beyond his reach.\nQiu Tong walked up to him with her head lowered. She placed her hands on Jin Yang’s shoulders and muttered softly, “We can do a more in-depth test on the children. This way, we might be able to distinguish their link to Song Yang… and to you.”\nJin Yang shook his head and rejected her suggestion. Faint lines appeared in the corners of his eyes.\n“The children have experienced too many things recently. Their emotions have just stabilized. I don’t want to agitate them anymore.”\n“No matter what happened in the past, it won’t affect my decision or judgment.”\n“The future is the most important, isn’t it?”\nJin Yang looked up at her, and the determination in his eyes touched her. She used her slender, fair fingertips to caress Jin Yang’s black hair, and the two of them hugged tightly in passion. Jin Yang placed his palm on her cheek and gently kissed her red lips. It was as if he was recounting his deep love for her features as he slowly traced the shape of her lips.\n“Ouch!”\nA crashing sound was suddenly heard from outside the door. Qiu Tong and Jin Yang looked at each other as they pushed the door open. When they saw Qiu Xingyuan, Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu running away in a panic, Qiu Tong sighed helplessly. Jin Yang curled his lips and carried her by the waist, using his knees to close the door.\nQiu Tong widened her eyes. She looked at Jin Yang, who was pressing down on her. From the corner of her eye, she saw the wedding photo on the bedside table. A gentle look flashed across her eyes as she responded to his kiss. Jin Yang raised his hand to caress the back of her legs, letting her slowly wrap them around his waist.\nJin Yang’s breathing was a little heavy. He was especially careful to avoid the place where Qiu Tong was injured.\nMeanwhile, Qiu Tong took the initiative to unbutton his shirt. The tip of her tongue licked his Adam’s apple charmingly and slowly moved down, repeatedly licking his chest. Jin Yang was naturally unwilling to remain passive. He hugged her and pushed deep into her.\nQiu Tong’s body hung off Jin Yang. She gently hooked her arms around his shoulders. Every second in contact with him brought extreme pleasure and excitement. Jin Yang wrapped his arms around her legs and raised his head to give her a deep kiss. Ambiguous noise sounded in the bedroom.\nQiu Tong looked up. She was a little distracted as she recalled the abnormality in the Qiu family’s old residence. There seemed to be messy traces of dragging and rummaging under the thick layer of dust. Did this mean that someone had searched the Qiu family residence before her? Who were the people hiding behind the scenes? Was it related to Jin Yang?\nJin Yang noticed her distraction and gently bit her soft chest in dissatisfaction.\nA numb current swept through her body as she moaned softly. When she saw Jin Yang’s ferocious beast-like eyes, she hurriedly begged for mercy, but it was too late.. Jinyang tormented her until she had no strength left in her body before hugging her in satisfaction.",

      "content": "Chapter 252: Yu Ge’s Bail\nIn the S City prison, Yu Ge squatted in a corner with fear in his eyes. His body was thin as he gnawed on a rotten bun.\nAs a member of the terrorist organization, Yu Ge was under special custody in the prison.\nThe criminals here were all evil people. Yu Ge suffered inhuman pain every day. His eyes were bloodshot, and his expression was so lifeless that he was about to collapse.\nThe prison guard took out his keys and opened the metal door. He frowned at Yu Ge. “You, come out!”\nYu Ge got up shakily. He used his weak hands to support himself against the metal door railing as he said with a trembling voice, “Help!”\nThe two prison guards looked at each other for a moment before bringing Yu Ge to the bathroom to wash up. They changed him into a clean prison uniform.\n“There’s a lawyer and family in the visiting room to see you.”\nYu Ge pointed at himself hesitantly. He repeated the guard’s words in disbelief.\nWhen Yu Ge was young, his parents had passed away due to an accident. He had no relatives at all. He had grown up in bad company in the streets, relying on despicable methods to cheat for food and drinks. Up until now, the only person who could be considered a family member was Qiu Tong, who had almost married him. However, it was impossible for her to bring a lawyer to bail him out!\nYu Ge dragged his heavy chains as he followed the prison guard into the visiting room.\nAt the table, a blonde man stood up in a well-ironed suit. He took out two bills and stuffed them into the prison guard’s hands before sending them out. Yu Ge looked at them curiously, his eyes filled with vigilance and distrust.\n“Hello, I am Terrence. This is the lawyer who helped to arrange for your bail.”\nYu Ge took two steps back and said in a clear voice, “You were hired by Qiu Tong to deceive me, right?”\nWhen Terrence saw that Yu Ge was extremely agitated, he hurriedly spread his arms to indicate for him to calm down.\n“Mr. Yu Ge, let’s sit down and chat.”\nYu Ge took a seat. Terrence gestured for the lawyer to hand over the two documents. He pushed his gold-framed glasses up his nose bridge and explained, “We are the executive assistant and lawyer of the overseas Liqing Corporation. You should have heard of the Liqing Corporation, right?”\n“Our CEO lived in S City more than 20 years ago and he had a child with his girlfriend at that time.”\n“After the CEO went overseas to develop his career, he broke off all contact with S City. Over the recent years, he has started looking for his child…”\nYu Ge looked up at Terrence in disbelief, as if he had already guessed what he was about to say. He quickly opened the documents, and it was indeed a paternity test report.\nTerrence said respectfully, “Yes, you’re our CEO’s son.”\n“We’ve done a detailed investigation and confirmation in advance, but if you don’t believe us, we can send you overseas to meet our CEO and do a paternity test again…” Terrence said slowly. He realized that Yu Ge had lifted his handcuffed arms. He said with a smile,” We’ll settle the relevant procedures. You can leave this place tonight”\nYu Ge heaved a long sigh of relief. He used half a minute to digest the sudden change in his status.\nWhen he looked up again, Yu Ge’s eyes shone with arrogance and madness. The tables have finally turned!\nHalf an hour later, Yu Ge walked out of the prison gate in a custom-made suit. He looked back with a cold smile on his face. Terrence instructed the driver to park the limousine at the entrance of the prison. Yu Ge sat inside with his suit jacket buttoned. He looked at the scenery outside the car window and asked, “Where are we going?”\nTerrence handed him a tablet. “The Liqing Corporation wants to develop their business in the country and has established a company in S City.”\n“Our CEO believes that you know the country and S City very well. This company will be under your control. We will listen to your orders and assist you with as well as we can. No matter what requests you have, we will do our best to help you fulfill them.”\nTerrence’s humble attitude made Yu Ge feel a little smug. The image of Qiu Tong appeared in his mind as he thought of a brilliant revenge plan.\n…\nIn the study of the villa, Qiu Tong locked the door from the inside and sat in front of the computer in her sleeping gown.\nQiu Tong took out the chip that Ye Luan had given her and carefully placed it into the device. Countless codes flashed across the computer screen as if it was an automated program. Qiu Tong narrowed her eyes and tapped the keyboard to decipher and analyze the data until the final step appeared on the blue screen. “Please enter the password.”\nIf the human modification plan was led by Qiu Rong, as Ye Luan had said, then the password might be related to her?\nQiu Tong tried the date of her birthday and Qiu Rong’s.\nHowever, a piercing alert rang out.\nA red exclamation mark on the screen kept flashing. “Final attempt. If the password continues to be entered incorrectly, the self-destruct sequence will be activated.”\nQiu Tong retracted her finger nervously. She didn’t dare to take the risk and could only resentfully put the chip away.\nIt was a tranquil night outside. Countless thoughts surged into her mind, causing her to feel anxious.\nQiu Tong stared at the string of numbers in her bank balance and muttered, “It looks like if we want to know the details of the human modification plan, we have to get Dad out as soon as possible…”",

      "content": "Chapter 253: Liqing Corporation\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nThe next morning, Qiu Tong was on the sofa scrolling through the information on the Dark Web, hoping to find some lucrative bounty missions.\nQiu Xingyu sat down close to her. Curious, she stole a glance at the screen that was flashing with information. She realized that they were recruitment notices regarding underground combat.\nQiu Xingyu immediately sat up in shock. She held Qiu Tong’s phone with both hands and shook her head worriedly.\n“Mommy! Do you need money? I have a lot. Can you not do anything dangerous?”\nQiu Xingyu’s voice was very loud. When Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao heard her, they hurriedly ran over.\nThe three pairs of scrutinizing eyes stared fixedly at Qiu Tong. Qiu Tong rubbed the top of Little Yu’s head with mixed emotions and comforted them. “Mommy is just bored…”\nQiu Xingyuan frowned and pursed his thin lips as he crossed his arms. Clearly, he did not believe her explanation.\nQiu Xingqiao moved quickly. He ran to the bedroom and took out their pink piggy bank. He raised it above his head, wanting to smash it.\nQiu Tong hurriedly stopped him. She understood that the children were worried about her safety and were being overly cautious.\nThe children of the Qiu family appeared more mature and smarter than their peers. But they had experienced several gun fights and kidnappings. They were still suffering from the psychological trauma.\nQiu Xingyu would still wake up from her nightmares and run to her room to hug her to sleep.\nQiu Tong hesitated for a moment before explaining in a way that they could accept, “You guys are outstanding. Mommy is proud of you.”\n“But does Mommy want to be trapped at home every day and rely on you guys to earn money to support the family? I also need to prove my worth and have some social interaction, right? Mommy needs to know some new friends and colleagues, just like how you have friends.”\nQiu Xingqiao and Qiu Xingyuan looked at each other, and their furrowed brows relaxed a little.\nQiu Xingyuan still had a stern expression on his face as he snatched the phone away. He said in a stiff voice, “Any job you take will require our approval!”\nQiu Xingyu nodded hurriedly. She lifted her little finger to make Qiu Tong pinky swear. “It can’t be dangerous!”\n“You have to stay at home with us during the weekends. Your working hours have to be stable, and the boss has to…”\nQiu Tong watched in amusement as the children listed the conditions. Her lips curled into a blissful smile.\nLate at night, Jin Yang and Shao An rushed back after finishing their work. When he returned to his bedroom, he took out a blank check that he had casually filled out and placed it by the bed.\nQiu Tong came out of the bathroom and looked at him in surprise.\nJin Yang hugged her slender waist and sniffed the fragrance of the shower gel on her body. He said in a hoarse voice, “I heard that you need money. You can tell me directly. We’re husband and wife…”\nQiu Tong pouted and pushed him away, looking at him seriously. “My relationship with you is not one of reliance.”\n“Money for household expenses, as well as the payments to Ke Le and housekeeper will come from you, but I hope to handle some private matters by myself. After all, you have no obligation or responsibility to bear it for me. I want our relationship to be more simple.”\nQiu Tong stared at him with clear eyes. These words sounded heartless and hurtful.\nHowever, Jin Yang understood that this was Qiu Tong’s own way of protecting herself. She was used to relying on herself and not others.\nJin Yang had to give her time to chance and learn to rely more on him.\nHe kept the check apologetically and apologized sincerely to her.\nQiu Tong stood on tip-toe and planted a light kiss on his lips, blinking as she silently expressed her longing for him.\nJin Yang bent down to pick her up. He pushed aside a glass bottle on the bar and slowly lowered Qiu Tong onto it.\nJust as the two of them were about to continue, the phone by the bed started vibrating.\nQiu Tong wiped the traces of her lipstick off Jin Yang’s lips and answered the call.\n“Hello? Are you Madam Qiu?”\n“I’m the General Manager’s assistant from the Liqing Corporation. The company is hiring a personal bodyguard for the General Manager. Are you interested in an interview?”\nTerrence’s deep voice came from the other end. Qiu Tong’s eyes widened in surprise. She took out Jin Yang’s phone from his pocket and quickly searched for information about Liqing Corporation. She realized that the Liqing Corporation was a legitimate company.\nShe readily agreed. “Alright, I’ll be there on time tomorrow.”\nThe steamy atmosphere in the bedroom had mostly dissipated. Jin Yang held Qiu Tong in his arms as the two of them examined the information about the Liqing Corporation.\nQiu Tong turned her head slightly and rubbed her head against Jin Yang’s chin. Jin Yang hugged her tightly, feeling a little ticklish.\nShe held Jin Yang’s finger and pointed at the screen. “Do you know them?”\nJin Yang let her fiddle with his fingertips as his Adam’s apple bobbed twice. He replied, “More than half of the overseas corporations who want to have a firm foothold in this country are in collusion with a terrorist organization, or dealing in illegal weapons or pharmaceuticals. The Liqing Corporation has only started expanding in recent years. We can’t be sure of their motives for wanting to develop a branch in S City.”\n“Are you sure you want to apply to be a bodyguard there?”\nJin Yang twirled Qiu Tong’s curly hair worriedly.\nQiu Tong’s eyes sparkled as she answered with a smile, “Of course. I need money and they’re willing to pay me handsomely.”\n“And I can help you gather some information.. There’s no reason to refuse.”",

      "content": "Chapter 254: Murderous Assessment\nAt the branch office of the Liqing Corporation in S City, a car with an extremely mysterious license plate parked on the opposite road attracted the attention of the employees.\nQiu Tong was wearing a comfortable suit with her hair tied into a high ponytail. She carried her sports-style backpack and kept scrolling through the messages she had received on her phone as she waited for Terrence in the hall.\nThe elevator slowly descended. Terrence walked quickly to her while tidying his suit. He said in a friendly manner, “Hello, Madam Qiu Tong. I’ll bring you to the 20th floor for the interview…”\n“You’re applying for the position of a bodyguard, so there might be a test of your professionalism. Is that okay?”\nQiu Tong nodded quickly and sized up Terrence from the corner of her eye. Although he looked like a common assistant, she had a nagging feeling that something was strange. For example, Terrence’s gaze made her feel uncomfortable. Was it just her imagination?\nWhen the elevator reached the 20th floor, her eyes focused on other distracting thoughts as she followed Terrence to a spacious room.\nThere was no one else in the office. It was strangely quiet.\nQiu Tong saw a boxing ring in the middle of the room and looked at Terrence in confusion. The latter quickly explained, “The Liqing Corporation is very powerful and influential. It’s inevitable that they will think of ways to attack the General Manager and launch a sneak attack on the family. A personal bodyguard needs to have some ability.”\n“I don’t think you will mind if we conduct some tests and evaluations on you?”\nTerrence asked politely as he picked up the protective equipment on the ground. “Sure.”\nClap! Clap!—Terrance clapped his hands with a smile as three burly men with bare upper bodies walked out of the door.\nTheir weight was more than twice or even three times that of Qiu Tong. Their bodies were filled with tight muscles, and the killing intent in their eyes and their professional attacking postures made Qiu Tong instantly nervous.\nShe chose a corner of the arena and stood there with her back to the corner.\nTerrence pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose and said lightly, “Please spar with each other. Don’t hurt each other.”\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes and raised her fist to block her face. As if they had discussed it beforehand, the burly men attacked her from three different directions. A heavy fist was aimed at her abdomen. She nimbly bent down and tried to dodge, but she still suffered a hit to her cheek.\nThe metallic taste of blood filled her mouth as she spat it out, adjusting her breathing.\nThe combatant’s attacks were powerful, but his agility was inferior to Qiu Tong. She quickly realized that she absolutely couldn’t be besieged by all three at once. She picked the seemingly weakest opponent and raised her right leg to kick his knee. After striking the same spot consecutively, the opponent’s body quickly swayed unsteadily.\nQiu Tong then found the right opportunity to circle around him. She stepped on the rope of the boxing ring and jumped up, kicking fiercely at the chest of another burly man.\nThe opponent immediately fell outside the ring. Qiu Tong had expended a lot of stamina, and she used her arm to wipe the sweat from her forehead.\nTerrence narrowed his eyes and looked up at the surveillance camera in the corner of the room. Via his Bluetooth earpiece, he soon received the order. He nodded at the two remaining burly men on the field. They instantly took out two batons from behind their waists…\nQiu Tong’s eyes widened abruptly. She turned to look at Terrence and questioned, “Is this also part of the assessment?”\nTerrence shrugged and nodded. “Of course. When we encounter an attack, none of us can determine if the other party is carrying a weapon. How you will deal with it as part of our assessment. Please do your best. They won’t hurt you.”\nBullshit! Qiu Tong nearly cursed out loud.\nThe moment the burly men appeared, they were filled with killing intent. She gritted her teeth and retreated. From the corner of her eye, she saw a short stick on the ground and took the opportunity to pick it up and attack. She knew that if she continued to fight with them, she would definitely not have the slightest advantage.\nShe deliberately exposed an opening to attract the burly man over. Their batons aimed for Qiu Tong’s weak spots, her waist and knees.\nCrack! Qiu Tong could hear the bones in her body cracking. Her eyes turned red as she gritted her teeth and secretly covered her palm on her elbow. She used her special ability to heal her injuries before abruptly breaking the wooden stick, revealing sharp wooden stumps.\nQiu Tong’s stick pierced the left side of the burly man’s waist, causing blood to drip onto the ground.\nTerrence hurriedly stopped her in surprise. She leaned against the railing unsteadily and took off her protective gear. Wiping the blood from the corner of her lips with the back of her hand, she asked weakly, “How is it? Did I pass the test?”\n“Can you bring me to see the boss?”\nQiu Tong’s sharp gaze was focused on Terrence. Who was behind this almost brutal and murderous “assessment”?\nThe burly men supported each other as they left the room. Before they left, their eyes were filled with fear and admiration.\nWhen Terrence received the instructions through his earpiece, he put on a proper smile and directed Qiu Tong to the other office.\nAfter passing through the long corridor, she pushed open the wooden door at the end of the corridor.\nCreak—the door slowly opened. The bright lights blinded her for a moment, and then she saw Yu Ge’s disgusting face!\n“It’s you?!”",

He took off his earpiece and unabashedly displayed the scene on the LCD screen to her. He replayed the scene of her being hit by the burly men repeatedly, clearly mocking her.\nQiu Tong scrutinized Terrence and Yu Ge, trying to guess their relationship.\nShe asked warily, “You should be in prison. Why are you here?”\n“Did you kidnap the General Manager of the Liqing Corporation?”\nYu Ge laughed wildly. He pointed at the nameplate in front of the desk. “Open your eyes and look at it carefully!”\n“You’re pitifully stupid! This company is mine, and so is the Liqing Corporationâ€¦”\nQiu Tong’s mind raced. The Liqing Corporation’s office was real and couldn’t be faked.\nEver since Terrence brought her to the General Manager’s office, they had not seen any security guards or employees. Was Yu Ge telling the truth? Yu Ge looked at her shocked expression and felt unprecedented satisfaction.\nHe slowly walked to her and poked her shoulder, a sinister and cunning smile appearing in his eyes.\n“You didn’t expect this, did you? You were hired to be my personal bodyguard!”\n“We used to be so good together. Maybe we can start over. I won’t despise youâ€¦”\nQiu Tong shook off Yu Ge’s hand harshly. “Stop dreaming!”\nYu Ge was not embarrassed. He pressed his thumb to his lips and took out two cheques worth $5 million.\n.....\n“You need money, a lot of money. That’s why you posted your personal information on the Dark Web, hoping to get a mission and a job.”\n“The salary offered by the other jobs will not be as high as mine. Moreover, I can use the Liqing Corporation’s name to ban your account. No one in the Dark Web will dare to contact you again. How about that? Do you want to reconsider?”\nWhen Yu Ge saw her furious expression, waves of satisfaction surged from the bottom of his heart.\nHe flung the cheques at her face and looked at her fluttering hair. Yu Ge roared, “Do you know what kind of inhumane life I led in prison? All of that was thanks to you! I was thinking about how to repay you every single moment!”\nYu Ge gritted his teeth. He saw the red marks on her face and pinched her chin in a perverted manner. “You have no choice!”\nQiu Tong stared at him in disdain. She didn’t want to have anything to do with him anymore.\nJust as she was about to turn around and leave, she saw a familiar figure standing behind Terrence.\nQiu Tong stopped in surprise as she recalled where she had seen him.\n730 Guangming Road! He was one of the people who attacked the professor! Could they be linked to the human modification plan?\nQiu Tong clenched her fists and quickly pretended to reconsider.\nShe stared fixedly at Yu Ge and said, “I can be your bodyguard, but other than protecting your personal safety, I won’t listen to any of your orders. If you are fine with that, we’ll sign the contract.”\nYu Ge stared at her in surprise and laughed out loud.\n“Don’t regret this!”\nHe instructed Terrence to bring the contract over and watch her sign it.\nYu Ge’s lips curled into a playful smile. He wanted to torture her slowly. When she bent down to pick up the cheques, he strode forward and looked up at her. “My shoes are a little dirty. Help me wipe them?”\nA cold glint flashed across her eyes as she hit Yu Ge’s knee with her hand. Yu Ge retreated in pain. Taking advantage of his retreat, she picked up the cheques. “No matter how dirty your shoes are, they can’t compare to the dirt in your heart.”\nQiu Tong stopped beside Terrence and said softly, “With a boss like Yu Ge, Liqing probably won’t be able to last more than half a year. No matter how he got to this position, I hope you can reconsider. Don’t risk the company over him.”\nShe patted Terrence’s shoulder and quickly walked out of the company building.\nYu Ge clutched his knee and jumped in pain.\nHe was cursing and swearing like a hooligan.\nTerrence looked at him and thought of Qiu Tong’s words. Doubt flashed across his eyes.\nThe car across the road honked twice when it saw her.\nQiu Tong quickly crossed the sidewalk and pulled the door open to sit in the backseat. The first thing Jin Yang saw was the scar on her lips. A cold glint flashed across his eyes as he raised his hand to touch her lips. “Who hurt you?”\nQiu Tong shook her head and handed the cheques to Shao An for him to settle. She then said seriously, “Yu Ge is the General Manager of Liqing Corporation.”\nShao An was so shocked that he almost choked. He thumped his chest and turned to look at Qiu Tong from the front passenger seat. “Is it the one locked up in prison? Didn’t he just go in? How could he be released so quickly?”\nQiu Tong frowned and looked at Jin Yang. “You should confirm as soon as possible if Dina and the other members of the terrorist organization are still in jail. If things go out of control, the consequences will be too greatâ€¦”\nJin Yang’s expression was gloomy. Shao An realized the seriousness of the problem and immediately rushed to the prison to investigate.\nOn the way back, the car was so quiet that even the sound of breathing could be heard.. Qiu Tong and Jin Yang were consumed by their own thoughts.",

The leaves swayed as black shadows and rustling sounds created a terrifying atmosphere.\nQiu Xingyu was so frightened that her eyes turned red as she hid under the covers. She hummed a nursery rhyme to herself. It was late into the night when the children finally fell asleep.\nShao An returned to the villa shrouded in a cold aura. He looked at Jin Yang and Qiu Tong solemnly as he reported the news from the prison.\n“According to the President’s instructions, I didn’t question the prison director directly. I just casually asked him about the recent developments in the prison. There were indeed convicts who were released on bail some time ago. They all committed minor crimes or behaved well in prison. There were a total of 13 people, and they are all in the records.”\n“There’s an underground illegal process in the prison. As long as you give enough money, you can reduce your sentence or even get bail.”\nQiu Tong lowered her gaze and recalled what the prison director told her about reducing Qiu Rong’s prison sentence. His words matched Shao An’s discovery.\nJin Yang narrowed his eyes, his expression void of any emotions. He tapped his leg with his fingers, indicating for Shao An to continue.\nThese local officials abused their position to get money. It wasn’t that Jin Yang didn’t know about this…\nShao An continued in a low and hoarse voice, “The warden said that Dina is a criminal under the President’s orders. Even if someone wants to bail him out secretly, no matter how much money is offered, they wouldn’t dare to release him. However, Yu Ge must have been separated from them for a period of time, so the warden doesn’t know the exact situation. I’ve retrieved the bail information from the prison. It was indeed Liqing Corporation who came forward.”\nJin Yang waved his hand, gesturing for him to go and rest. Qiu Tong exchanged glances with him, her eyes filled with varying degrees of confusion.\nQiu Tong sat on the bed with her laptop. She had been searching for relevant information about the Liqing Corporation in recent years and realized that the news was all positive reports. The CEO even participated in charity events every year…\nShe frowned as she flipped through the photos. She was surprised to see that the CEO of the Liqing Corporation had similar features to Yu Ge.\n“They could be father and son.”\n“Why do you want to continue being Yu Ge’s bodyguard?”\nJin Yang and Qiu Tong spoke at the same time.\nQiu Tong pursed her red lips and remained silent. She fiddled with her computer and retrieved the surveillance video of the villa’s gunfight. She pointed at the figure driving the van and said, “I saw him at the Liqing Corporation. He’s part of Yu Ge’s security team!”\nJin Yang instantly understood what she meant. He asked in return, “Do you think the foreign forces who want to snatch the human modification plan are linked to the Liqing Corporation?”\nQiu Tong nodded and zoomed in on the surveillance footage. Although the quality of the footage was a little blurry, one could still vaguely see a special tattoo on the soldier’s neck. The other soldiers also had the same mark. “It’s very likely that they’re assassins secretly trained by the Liqing Corporation.”\n“Their goal in S City is definitely not as simple as setting up a branch company.”\n“The professor was attacked some time ago. Shao An led his guards to track them, but some of them still managed to escape.”\n“Meanwhile, the captured armed personnel all committed suicide in jail. We couldn’t gather any information at all. The conspiracy behind this is shocking! Since I can use Yu Ge to get close to them and find some clues, why not give it a try?”\nQiu Tong urged Jin Yang to agree with his plan, but he retorted with a stern expression, “I can send someone else to spy.”\n“Although Yu Ge is the General Manager of the Liqing Corporation branch, I can tell that the real person in charge of the company is his assistant, Terrence.”\n“You want to arrange for a spy to infiltrate the company, but the core management will definitely not recruit outsiders. Even if you successfully infiltrate the company, none of your spies will be able to get close to confidential documents. It won’t mean much! Yu Ge is filled with hatred towards me now. He will definitely find a way to find trouble with me.”\nThe more he hates me, the more he can distract Terrence for me and give me a chance to find clues…\nQiu Tong smiled and leaned into Jin Yang’s arms. She said softly, “I understand that you’re worried about me. I promise you that I won’t be injured.”\n“Besides, you’re outside. If you sense something amiss, you can rush over to save me at any time, right?”\nJin Yang knew that he couldn’t change her mind, so he could only compromise and reiterate his conditions.\n“Keep in touch with me at all times!”\nQiu Tong raised her little finger and wagged it twice. “Okay!”\nThe night lamp emitted a dim light. She laid in Jin Yang’s arms and listened to his steady breathing.\nThe connection between the human modification plan and the foreign forces made them feel a little uneasy.\nYu Ge was the only way to break through. Qiu Tong was thinking of a plan in her mind, going over every single detail so as not to arouse Terrence’s suspicion. She secretly opened her eyes to look at Jin Yang’s determined profile. There were a few times when she wanted to ask him how much he knew about the plan.\nIn the end, she swallowed her words…",

      "content": "Chapter 257: Alliance\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nAt Liqing Corporation, Terrence handed out the standard uniform to Qiu Tong.\nQiu Tong opened it in front of him. She held the short skirt against her hips, not looking surprised at all.\nShe stared into Terrence’s eyes and said mockingly, “I didn’t expect your company’s taste to be so special.”\nQiu Tong threw the clothes on the ground and pushed the door open to walk to her office. She said coldly to Yu Ge, “I agreed to be your bodyguard to ensure your safety. As for clothes, I won’t trouble you to provide me with any!”\nYu Ge raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her with a perverted expression. Seeing this, Terrence found an excuse to leave as well.\nThey were the only ones in the office. Qiu Tong asked tentatively, “When did you find out about your status?”\nYu Ge looked at her in surprise and suspicion before walking arrogantly to her side. “You noticed?”\n“You’re indeed a smart woman! How is it? Do you want to consider being with me?”\n“Those high officials in the political world will never marry commoners. They just want to play with you.”\nYu Ge recalled the person who had appeared beside her during the riot. His pupils constricted as he cleared his throat and continued to deceive her. “On the account that we had a relationship in the past, I can let you be my lover! You need to support three children. The expenses will definitely be huge, right?”\nQiu Tong concealed the pity in her eyes as she secretly mocked Yu Ge’s stupidity and arrogance.\nShe deliberately looked hesitant to let Yu Ge lower his guard.\nQiu Tong looked up at the computer and asked casually, “How can I trust you?”\n“You’ve lied to me before. Moreover, I heard that the Liqing Corporation has a huge amount of assets and is involved in many projects. You don’t seem to have any decision-making power in the company. Instead, you’re like a puppet. I need a stable life with my children. I won’t bet with you!”\nQiu Tong twisted her fingers and tried her best to appear weak while secretly observing his reaction.\nIt was obvious that Yu Ge enjoyed this change in Qiu Tong.\nHe sat beside her and whispered exaggeratedly, “Don’t think that Terrence is in charge of the company. He listens to me! I heard them say that they want to develop a pharmaceutical project in S City yesterday…”\n“These things are very profitable. If you follow me, you will definitely get a lot of money!”\nYu Ge hooked her chin with his finger. She suppressed the disgust in her heart and endured his actions for three seconds before pushing him aside again.\nQiu Tong stood up and ran to the vicinity of the computer in a panic. She quickly scanned the state of the equipment with her peripheral vision.\nThis computer should have adequate access to hack into the Liqing Corporation’s network and retrieve relevant information about the project. Qiu Tong frowned when she realized that the bottom drawer of the desk was locked.\nYu Ge could tell that something was off so she hurriedly found an excuse to cover up this incident.\n…\nIn an apartment hotel in S City, Chen Jia was treating the wound on her wrist and waiting for Jin Tao’s order.\nThe video call on the computer was quickly connected. Chen Jia tidied herself and appeared in front of the camera. She lowered her head apologetically and said, “Sir, I didn’t complete my mission. I’m sorry!” She was a spy that Jin Tao had planted beside Jin Yang and Qiu Tong, with the goal of weakening their relationship.\nNow that her plan had failed, Chen Jia could only wait for Jin Tao’s punishment.\nJin Tao’s expression did not change at all. In fact, there was even a hint of tolerance and benevolence in the corners of his eyes.\nHe said indifferently, “Don’t return to the capital for the time being. Stay in S City and continue to observe Jin Yang and Qiu Tong’s movements. Report to me at any time, but don’t let them detect your existence. Learn to use other people’s hands…”\n“According to the information you gather, think of a way to create trouble for Qiu Tong and Jin Yang… Do you understand?”\nChen Jia nodded solemnly. When the video call ended, she looked down at the yellow dress by her feet, her eyes filled with determination to obey orders.\nAfter receiving the new information in her email, Chen Jia scanned Lin Shan’s photo and immediately left the apartment for the police station.\nLin Shan was sentenced to 15 days in detention for disturbing the residence with malicious intent. The detention center was very rundown. She had tried to contact Shu Xian several times, but failed. Just as she lost hope, the police officer suddenly unlocked the door, indicating that she could leave.\nChen Jia waited outside the police station. She looked at Lin Shan and raised her hand as she walked over slowly. “Shall we find a place to talk?”\nLin Shan looked at her in confusion. With a faint smile on her lips, Chen Jia said softly, “Qiu Tong is our common enemy.”\nQiu Tong’s name agitated Lin Shan. She dug her fingers into her palms and said with hatred, “Alright! I’ll leave with you!”\nAt the roadside stall, Chen Jia expressed her intention to work with Lin Shan to frame Qiu Tong.\nRecalling her failures, Lin Shan shook her head and reminded, “Qiu Tong is very smart. We can’t do it alone…”\nChen Jia used her hand to shield herself from the glaring sunlight. She asked with a smile, “What if I can help Shu Xian get the piece of land he wants? You should have a way to get him to join our side, right?”",

      "content": "Chapter 258: Hacker Mission\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nAt dusk, Qiu Tong came out of Liqing Corporation.\nShe loosened her ponytail and shook her heavy head, taking two deep breaths of the cold air.\nQiu Tong had thought of all sorts of methods to get around Yu Ge. Currently, she was seeing some results.\nShe located the car parked in the alley and opened the door. She threw herself into the backseat and closed her eyes.\nShao An ordered the driver to drive towards their villa in the forest.\nQiu Tong leaned her elbow against the window and said in a faint and tired voice, “You don’t have to pick me up every day…”\nShao An answered with a stern expression, “We have to carry out the President’s orders. Currently, all the forces are hidden in the dark. Although the protective measures of the villa can withstand a small-scale attack, your journey to-and-fro the villa and the company is a vulnerability. We need to ensure your safety.”\nHe had a stubborn personality and only acknowledged Jin Yang’s orders. Qiu Tong could only sigh in resignation.\nIn the villa, Jin Yang was playing with the children. When he saw her, he got up and took her coat to hang on the coat hanger in the entrance hall.\nQiu Tong hugged him intimately while Jin Yang patted her shoulder gently. At this moment, it was as if all the fatigue from the day had been dispelled.\nQiu Xingyu raised her hand shyly to cover her eyes, but in the next second, her grape-like eyes were revealed from the gaps between her fingers as they blinked. Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao covered her eyes in disdain and carried her to the back of the sofa to play…\nThe nanny was busy in the kitchen. Taking advantage of this free time, Qiu Tong casually picked up a ballpoint pen and some paper. She closed her eyes to recall the structure of the Liqing Corporation. Within five minutes, she had drawn a rough architectural map and route.\nJin Yang sat beside her and looked at her solemnly. “Do you have a plan?”\nQiu Tong nodded and used a ballpoint pen to poke at the location of the computer desk in Yu Ge’s office. She explained, “Through my observations over the past few days, I can confirm that Yu Ge’s computer has the right to enter the company’s network, but he doesn’t know the password.”\n“I’ll find a chance to send him away tomorrow. I’ll take the opportunity to download a software for cracking the password into the computer.”\n“As long as we get the passcode, we can read and retrieve all the information in the Liqing Corporation…”\nQiu Tong discussed the plan with Jin Yang. Jinyang frowned slightly as he considered the danger of implementing the plan.\nThey didn’t realize that Qiu Xingyu had come to their side. She held her face with her chubby hands and muttered softly, “There’s a loophole in Mommy’s plan! Passwords can be dynamic or static. If the other party set a dynamic password, it would be useless even if we can crack the password at that particular time!”\n“And even if the other party used a static password, they would have installed firewalls and intercepting software. They would be able to detect an invasion… it would only take half an hour to reboot the system. There’s a high chance that Mommy’s plan will fail!”\nQiu Xingyu’s eyes were filled with innocence as she spoke. Her brows furrowed slightly as Qiu Tong scooped her up and hugged her. Her tone was filled with pride as she said, “I almost forgot that Little Yu is an expert in computers. Does Little Yu have any good methods to help Mommy?”\nQiu Xingyu gently tapped the tip of Qiu Xingyu’s nose with her finger and lowered her head to kiss her fragrant face.\nQiu Xingyu was so happy that her eyes narrowed into a straight line. She raised two fingers and shook them as she said sweetly, “You need to cooperate with me!”\n“Mommy will bring Little Yu on her mission. I only need half an hour! I will definitely be able to help Mommy obtain the information she needs…”\nWhen Qiu Tong heard her suggestion, her expression changed instantly as she placed her on the sofa and rejected, “No.”\nThere were too many unknowns in the Liqing Corporation. According to the information she had, there were at least a dozen skilled assassins and bodyguards inside. Qiu Xingyu was a child, how could she go to such a dangerous place?\nQiu Xingyu wanted to get Ke Le to carry Qiu Xingyu away, but she refused to let go of her sleeve.\nQiu Xingyu’s cute bun-like face was scrunched up at this moment. Her clear and distinct eyes were filled with determination as she said, “Little Yu is the best hacker! I can help Mommy. Why can’t Little Yu go with you?”\nHearing the disappointment in her voice, Qiu Tong could only gently hug and coax her. “It’s very dangerous there.”\nWhen Qiu Xingyu heard her answer, she tightened her grip on Qiu Tong’s neck. Her tears and mucus gathered as she said, “Little Yu wants to go with Mommy!”\nQiu Tong could feel the fear in her heart. All her words turned into a soft sigh.\nShe did need help to infiltrate Liqing Corporation’s network and Qiu Xingyu’s computer talent made her the most suitable choice. Putting aside the fact that she was her daughter, there was no reason for her to refuse.\nQiu Xingyu bit her red lips and thought for a moment. In the end, she gave in and gently patted her head. “Alright, Mommy will bring you there.”\nQiu Xingyu wiped her snot with the back of her hand and curled her pinky excitedly.\nPatter patter patter. Qiu Tong heard a flurry of footsteps behind her.. She turned around and saw Qiu Xingyuan, Qiu Xingqiao and Ye Luan standing behind her with stern expressions. They said seriously, “We’re going too!”",

She nudged Jin Yang’s elbow in an attempt to get him to help.\nQiu Xingyuan pursed his thin lips into a straight line. His exquisite and cold eyes revealed his helplessness.\nThe silence made Qiu Tong feel pressured. Qiu Xingqiao was a straightforward person. He raised his stubborn face. “I can guard the door for Mommy and Little Yu. If bad guys come, I can stall for time! Bring me along too, alright?”\nQiu Xingyuan added, “We can take care of each other!”\nQiu Tong felt a little tired when she heard the three children’s adult-like reasoning.\nShe knocked on the coffee table, interrupting Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao’s heated discussion. Qiu Tong tilted her head patiently and explained, “Our mission requires us to keep below the radar. Therefore, the fewer people there are, the safer it is.”\n“If we were going to a direct confrontation, Mommy will definitely bring you guys along!”\nQiu Tong gently rubbed the top of Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao’s heads. Looking at their dazed expressions, her lips curled into a gentle smile.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao’s eyes gradually dimmed. They folded their fingertips silently and returned to their respective bedrooms dejectedly.\n…\nThe bedroom was filled with incense in the middle of the night. The comforting smell of sandalwood wafted in the air.\nKnock knock. Qiu Tong pushed the door open and saw Qiu Xingyuan standing in his pajamas. She hurriedly bent down and hugged him, asking with concern, “Did you have a nightmare?”\nQiu Xingyuan took a step back awkwardly. He kept his distance from her with a frown. It was obvious that he was still angry.\nQiu Tong tilted her head and looked at him. Qiu Xingyuan bit his thin lips as he raised his hand to stuff the syringe and medicine into her palm.\n“It’s a newly concocted anesthetic. As long as it’s injected into the skin, the other party will experience paralysis and stiffness in their limbs within five seconds, causing them to lose their ability to speak and move. I’ve done two experiments earlier. The effects will last for about half an hour.”\n“There’s also a flash bomb. When you encounter danger and need to escape, it can create a blind spot for a few seconds…”\nQiu Xingyuan explained the usage of the medicine and bomb in a muffled voice. Qiu Tong felt a warmth in her heart. She hugged Qiu Xingyuan in her arms. As she listened to his strong heartbeat, she felt a happiness and satisfaction she had never felt before.\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes and teased, “Don’t worry, Mommy will definitely return safely. Big baby, wait at home obediently. Don’t worry!”\nQiu Xingyuan’s eyes turned slightly red, but he quickly suppressed his emotions and wiped away his tears. “Who’s worried about you?”\nQiu Tong couldn’t help laughing as she stroked his face. She sent Qiu Xingyuan back to his bed and coaxed him to sleep. She thought that Jin Yang had already fallen asleep, so she quietly returned to her room. The moment she lifted the blanket, she saw a pair of deep eyes beside her…\nJin Yang wrapped his arms around her and pulled her into his embrace, her back pressed tightly against his burning chest.\nThe two heartbeats slowly matched.\nHe lifted her hair and lowered his head to kiss her neck. His gentle and slender fingers held her soft chest and kneaded it.\nJin Yang gently pinched her red buds. When he heard the seductive moan from her lips, he sighed helplessly.\nQiu Tong felt him leave for a moment before an icy cold chain was hung around her neck.\nJin Yang put on a snowflake-shaped necklace around Qiu Tong’s neck. He gently hugged her as he turned her to face him. The two of them looked into each other’s eyes. Jin Yang gently rubbed her earlobe with his fingertips and leaned forward to kiss her delicate red lips. He placed his forehead against hers. “The necklace has a tracking device. Touching it three times will activate the alert mode. I will receive the signal…”\n“If you encounter any danger, remember to inform me immediately. I’ll bring Shao An to wait at the periphery, got it?”\nJin Yang inexplicably felt flustered and uneasy as he exhorted repeatedly.\nQiu Tong held the snowflake necklace in her hand and responded with a smile, “Okay.”\n…\nThe next morning, Terrence stopped in his tracks when he saw Qiu Xingyu. He asked about the situation.\nAn apologetic smile appeared on Qiu Tong’s lips. She pulled Qiu Xingyu’s hood down to cover most of her face as she explained softly, “My daughter is sick and has a fever. No one in the family can help take care of her, so I brought her to work with me today.”\n“Don’t worry, she’s very obedient. She won’t affect our work.”\nQiu Xingyu sensibly gave a cough and silently raised her hand to tug at his sleeve. She begged in a soft and hoarse voice, “Uncle, can you let me stay here? I want to be with Mommy!”\nTerrence frowned and waved them into Yu Ge’s office.\nQiu Xingyu secretly lifted the brim of her hood and stared at Terrence’s back as he left.\n“Mommy, I’ve planted a tracker device on him!”\nQiu Xingyu’s eyes sparkled with pride.. She pointed at the moving red dot on the screen. “I’m very good!”",

      "content": "Chapter 260: Instant Danger\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nThe office was filled with cold air, making one feel as if they had fallen into an igloo.\nYu Ge looked up and saw Qiu Xingyu. He walked towards her in surprise, his eyes filled with sinister intent. He pinched Qiu Xingyu’s cheeks tightly as he whispered, “Do you still remember me?”\nQiu Xingyu shrank back and struggled to escape Yu Ge’s teasing. Her body trembled uncontrollably.\nQiu Tong sensed her uneasiness. She hurriedly used her body to shield Little Yu as she warned coldly, “Stay away from her! If you dare to touch my child, I will fight you to the death… I will never let you off!”\nYu Ge sneered sinisterly before dusting off his hands and lighting the cigar in his mouth.\nQiu Xingyu recalled that when they were still living in the dilapidated house, Yu Ge had taken the opportunity to abuse Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao in every way possible.\nAll sorts of memories surged into her mind, causing Qiu Xingyu to instinctively fear Yu Ge.\nShe closed her eyes tightly and leaned on Qiu Tong’s shoulder to calm her emotions.\nQiu Tong patted her back gently and walked straight to the desk in the corner to take a seat.\nYu Ge was unwilling to let them off. Propping his chin on his hands at the desk, he deliberately blew smoke from his cigar at Qiu Xingyu. The smoke made her cough non-stop. A murderous intent surged in Qiu Tong’s eyes. She wanted to slam the table and flip it against him. However, Qiu Xingyu sensibly tugged at her sleeve. “Mommy, I’m fine!”\n“Oh, I didn’t expect your relationship to be so good now.”\n“Back then, you wanted to elope with me and got Lin Shan to find a buyer. You wanted to sell them… could it be that you continued to keep them by your side because you saw that they were capable enough to earn money for you?”\n“Qiu Tong, why don’t I help you find a buyer? Leave those burdens behind. We can…”\nYu Ge deliberately brought up the past to instigate Qiu Xingyu.\nQiu Tong covered Qiu Xingyu’s ear, wanting to prevent her from hearing his nonsense.\nHowever, Qiu Xingyu turned to look straight at him. She said firmly, “Mommy won’t!”\n“Mommy loves us. Back then, it was all because of you, a baddie, who bewitched her!”\nQiu Xingyu moved forward, wanting to slap Yu Ge. Yu Ge frowned and took two steps back. He licked his teeth impatiently and smashed the crystal display beside him. He raised his hand and pointed at Qiu Xingyu as he scolded loudly, “Shut up!”\n“If I hear any more noise from you, I’ll throw you out the window. Do you believe me?”\nYu Ge pushed open the window, wanting to snatch Qiu Xingyu from Qiu Tong.\nQiu Tong turned her back to him and protected Qiu Xingyu in her arms, using her elbow to hit an injured spot that Yu Ge had sustained in the prison.\nYu Ge gasped and bent down to cover his wound. He was in so much pain that his entire body was twitching and his teeth were chattering.\nQiu Tong pretended to look down at him kindly and called the secretary to help him.\nNow, only the mother and daughter pair were left in the office. She quickly lowered the blinds and blocked the surveillance cameras.\nQiu Xingyu shook her head to get rid of her fear and took the opportunity to run to the computer. She typed rapidly on the keyboard, her eyes sparkling as she cracked the password to the network.\nQiu Tong listened for any movement outside while searching for any hidden nooks that might contain information.\nThe Liqing Corporation’s network was set up by experts. The layers of firewalls and anti-tracking software made it difficult for Qiu Xingyu.\nQiu Xingyu was so anxious that her forehead was covered in cold sweat. She pouted gently and tried her best to think from the perspective of a cybersecurity expert in order to crack it. However, the progress was not smooth. She was stuck at the final stage and could not advance…\nYu Ge had been gone for about 15 minutes. Qiu Tong frowned and walked to Qiu Xingyu’s side. She couldn’t bear to hurry her.\nQiu Xingyu took some time to rub the tip of her nose with her thumb and hit the space button. A progress bar appeared on the computer screen!\nQiu Tong’s eyes widened in surprise. She quickly inserted the USB drive she carried with her into the computer. The office was so quiet that the sound of two hearts beating could be heard.\nThe sound of the elevator arriving suddenly rang out!\nQiu Xingyu saw the red dot on her wristwatch getting closer and closer to them. She tugged at her mother’s wrist in a panic. “Mommy, the bad guy is coming…”\nQiu Tong covered Qiu Xingyu’s mouth with her hand and quickly searched for a place to hide in the room. She stuffed her into a cabinet.\n“Shh, no matter what you hear outside, don’t come out unless Mommy calls you. Got it?”\nQiu Tonghad stuffed the medicine produced by Qiu Xingyuan into her hand. Qiu Xingyu wanted to reject her, but Qiu Tong quickly closed the cabinet door. Qiu Tong then quickly turned around and sat on the sofa, just as the door to the room opened. She pretended to be calm as she looked up at Terrence.\nOut of the corner of her eye, she saw that the cabinet door was not closed properly. She stood up to block Terrence’s view of the cabinet.\nAlthough Terrence would not be surprised to see Qiu Xingyu in the office, Qiu Tong didn’t dare to take the risk!\nIf Terrence discovered something amiss, she could fight him to the death. However, if Terrence managed to get hold of Qiu Xingyu as a hostage, she would probably go crazy. Therefore, she had to hide Qiu Xingyu to prevent any accidents from happening…\nThe two of them stared at each other for half a minute. Terrence looked at the empty office and frowned suspiciously at Qiu Tong.\n“Where’s Mr. Yu Ge?”\nTerrence asked while Qiu Tong tried her best to calm her rapid breathing.. She answered steadily, “His old injury acted up and he’s getting treatment for it.”",

The shadows cast by the light made it impossible to see his expression at that moment. He said in a relaxed tone, “Why did you pull down the blinds?”\nQiu Tong chuckled and looked up indifferently. “Why don’t you ask Yu Ge?”\n“Why did he force you to hire me as his personal bodyguard? With the security you have, you can totally protect him.”\n“Yu Ge wanted to take revenge on me, humiliate me and trap me by his side. He covered the window earlier as he wanted to have sex with me. I beat him up, which is why his old injuries…”\nQiu Tong fabricated a lie. “You can ask him for confirmation.”\nQiu Tong shrugged and threw herself onto the sofa. She deliberately moved her shirt to reveal the love bites left behind by Jin Yang last night.\nShe challenged Terrence indifferently with her gaze, a sarcastic smile on her lips.\n“But with Yu Ge’s personality, he will probably scold you harshly and then chase you off in his capacity as the General Manager of the Liqing Corporation. I advise you not to try. He hasn’t been successful recently and is in a bad mood…”\nTerrence pushed his gold-framed glasses up his nose and stared at Qiu Tong with suspicion and uncertainty.\nYu Ge had briefly mentioned her identity and his past experiences with her to him. Terrence felt that her appearance in the Liqing Corporation would affect them, but Yu Ge was stubborn. As a result, Terrence had no choice but to just remain vigilant against her.\nTerrence hesitated for a moment before his expression quickly changed to that of a gentleman. He smiled and said, “Miss Qiu, you must be joking.”\n“We have no right to ask Mr. Yu Ge about his affairs.”\nTerrence turned around to leave, but the computer suddenly beeped!\nA sinister glint flashed across his eyes as he closed the door. “Miss Qiu, you’d better not move…”\nQiu Tong pretended to be calm as she looked to the side. Terrence slowly walked towards the computer. She secretly took out the dagger she carried with her from her sleeve, prepared to fight him at any moment.\nThe atmosphere in the office instantly became filled with the smell of gunpowder. Terrence saw the computer flash with a red light. Just as he was about to see the display screen, there was suddenly a commotion in the corridor. There were people cursing and loud fighting noises…\n“Mr. Yu Ge! Don’t be rash. You will tear your wound apart!”\nThe secretary stopped him in a panic. Terrence narrowed his eyes and chose to let Qiu Tong off for the time being to run out and deal with the emergency.\nQiu Tong heaved a sigh of relief as she placed her hand on her rapidly beating heart.\nThrough the glass window, Qiu Tong saw a figure flash past. She felt that it looked familiar, but she had no time to care about the trouble Yu Ge was in. She bent down and opened the cabinet, wanting to carry Qiu Xingyu out.\n“Little Yu?!”\nQiu Tong opened the cabinet. It was empty.\nShe immediately looked around anxiously and knocked on every wooden board. Soon, Qiu Xingyu’s soft voice came from the bottom of a bookcase. The loose wooden boards moved a little, and Qiu Xingyu stuck her head out. Her cute face was streaked with dust. “Mommy! There’s a dark room here! There are many scary things inside…”\nQiu Xingyu stared at the red dot on her watch and said in a hoarse voice, “Hurry, the bad guy won’t be back for the time being!”\nQiu Tong looked at the narrow passageway and quickly jumped in after Qiu Xingyu.\nAfter a long, dark slide, they opened their eyes. The scene before them was so shocking that they couldn’t close their mouths. This place was extremely similar to Professor Dong’s secret room.\nAround them were countless human specimens soaked in formaldehyde, and glass jars containing human organs…\nQiu Xingyu tugged at Qiu Tong’s hand nervously as she glanced at the red dot on her device from time to time. Qiu Tong was quietly shocked. It seemed like the Liqing Corporation was indeed targeting the human modification plan. Moreover, they had already obtained a certain amount of information and had begun their own research and development!\nThere were test tubes on the island counter. Qiu Tong looked at the data of their experiments and memorized them.\nQiu Xingyu stood on her tiptoes and leaned against the desk. Suddenly, she caught a glimpse of a familiar handwriting. She lowered her voice in excitement and greeted, “Mommy, it’s Grandpa’s handwriting! I recognize his notebook!”\nQiu Tong picked up the detailed notes. When she flipped to the title page, there was indeed Qiu Rong’s name written on the front.\nIt seemed like the human modification plan was undeniably linked to Qiu Rong!\nQiu Xingyu quietly held the notebook in her arms. They were afraid that Terrence would return, so they hurried back through the original passageway. Qiu Tong knew that too many strange things had happened today which would definitely put the Liqing Corporation on the alert. She hid the notebook in the bookcase and sat on the sofa with Qiu Xingyu in her arms to sort out her thoughts as she waited for Yu Ge and Terrence to return.\n“Mommy, I miss Grandpa!”\nQiu Xingyu looked tired. The high intensity and extreme tension made her a little dazed and she was about to fall asleep.\nShe mumbled, “When will Grandpa be back?”\nQiu Tong tidied her messy hair and straightened the pink bow. She kissed Qiu Xingyu gently and promised. “I’ll get him back as soon as possible! This matter is definitely linked to him.”\nShe also wanted to figure out Qiu Rong’s role in the human transformation plan!",

      "content": "Chapter 262: Vulture Organization\nQiu Tong retrieved her USB drive and used the excuse that Qiu Xingyu needed to go to the hospital to leave the Liqing Corporation earlier.\nIn the corner of the parking lot, countless cigarette butts were piled on the ground. When Jin Yang saw Qiu Tong, he instantly rushed over and hugged her tightly. Qiu Tong smelled the strong tobacco smell on his body. She patted his broad back gently. “Loosen up a little. I can’t breathe!”\nJin Yang slowly tightened his grip, as if he wanted to melt into her. “It’s good that you’re fine.”\nShao An held Qiu Xingyu’s hand and stood nearby. He had the courage to tease Jin Yang.\n“Miss Qiu, you have no idea. The President kept asking me for the time and whether there is a signal every two minutes. If you were just a little later, he would have barged in with the armed forces!”\nQiu Tong’s eyes widened in surprise as she got into the vehicle with Jin Yang and drove towards the villa. “You’re not the ones who caused the commotion to help us escape?”\nShao An, who was in the front passenger seat, waved his hand. He pointed at the walkie-talkie and informed all the guards to leave the designated location and move deeper into the forest.\n“All the squads are lying in ambush at the designated locations. There were no guards who acted on their own.”\nJin Yang held her hand tightly and asked about what had happened at the Liqing Corporation.\nAs Qiu Tong described what happened, silence fell in the vehicle. Shao An couldn’t help holding his breath in worry.\nIf it were him, he wouldn’t have been able to complete the mission as calmly as Qiu Tong had. Jin Yang stared at her with a dark expression. “Don’t go to the Liqing Corporation again!”\nJin Yang couldn’t take such a major risk.\nQiu Tong’s lips curled into a comforting smile. She leaned her head gently against Jin Yang’s shoulder and gradually fell asleep.\n…\nAt the villa, Qiu Tong and Jin Yang crowded in front of the computer as they seriously analyzed the information on the Liqing Corporation’s network.\nKe Le and the mercenaries looked over curiously. When they saw the special pattern on the screen, they said in surprise, “This is the totem symbol of the terrorist organization, Vulture. When we were doing missions on the Dark Web, we once ran into the ex-Vulture soldiers. They’re all vicious guys!”\n“I heard that every of the Vulture soldiers will have this totem tattooed on them. It’s used to determine their identity.”\nKe Le’s words made Qiu Tong very anxious. She asked, “Do you know who the founder or boss of Vulture is?”\nThe mercenaries shook their heads in confusion. Ke Le scratched his head foolishly and said in an apologetic voice, “Boss, Vulture soldiers are people in desperate situations. We have little interaction with them. We only heard that Vulture was founded ten years ago and has a huge influence. Their boss is very mysterious. Only a few of Vulture’s higher-ups are in contact with him. The low-level soldiers don’t know anything about him…”\nIt seemed like Vulture was a very mysterious group. Qiu Tong could vaguely sense that there was definitely a hidden conspiracy.\nQiu Xingyu helped to sort out the information from the network. Jin Yang looked at the information regarding the human modification plan and couldn’t help frowning. He looked at Shao An solemnly. “The information here is even more detailed than what we have!”\nShao An looked embarrassed. The information they had obtained behind Jin Tao’s back was lacking.\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes. She felt as if a huge net was approaching them, looming over their heads.\nShe stared at Jin Yang for a long time before finally choosing to trust the man in front of her. She asked, “What do you want to use the drug for?”\n“To transform the army and start more wars? To create super strong human weapons?”\nFaced with her questions, Jin Yang’s gaze did not waver at all. The contour of his face was firm and serious as he answered, “I yearn for peace. The original intention of the human modification plan was to optimize and improve humans, so that currently incurable diseases could be cured or prevented.”\n“I’ve never thought of starting a war or violating the laws of nature.”\n“Qiu Tong, I know you’re hiding something from me. If you’re unwilling to tell me, I won’t force you. But please believe me. We’re on the same side. We’re both working hard for the same goal.”\nJin Yang looked at her lovingly and gently. Her clenched fists gradually relaxed, and her lips curled into a smile.\n“The modification plan is probably related to my father. I want to get him out…”\n“Perhaps he can help us answer our questions.”\nJin Yang had already guessed a little. He looked at Shao An, indicating for him to settle the matter, but Qiu Tong stopped them. “The Vulture Organization and those people who want to kidnap the children are all watching us from the shadows. Your actions will probably attract a lot of trouble. Leave this to me.”\n“I’ll ask Yu Ge for the rest of my salary tomorrow and retrieve my father’s notebook.”\nJin Yang rejected her idea. He frowned and said coldly, “I can’t let you go to Liqing Corporation again.. Terrence is suspicious of you, he definitely won’t let you off so easily…”",

I guarantee that I won’t be injured and will leave the Liqing Corporation safely.”\n“For the Liqing Corporation to find Yu Ge at such a time, it is definitely not as simple as a father finding his son. On the surface, they have established a legitimate branch company, but they are secretly carrying out experiments on the human modification plan. Based on the information we have now, they have already progressed to stage two! It will be too late if we don’t stop them.”\n“I need to think of a way to drive a wedge between Yu Ge and Terrence and make them doubt each other.”\n“As long as we plant doubt in Yu Ge’s heart, he will be able to help us slow down Terrence’s movements. This will be very helpful to our future actions. And this mission is something that only I can execute.”\n“Jin Yang, you can’t blindly reject the most suitable plan because of our relationship.”\nQiu Tong stared at Jin Yang. Her words had rendered him speechless.\nJin Yang stood up angrily. For the first time in his life, he felt that his status as President was useless.\nHe couldn’t even protect the woman he loved right now!\nQiu Tong sensed his low spirits and took the initiative to walk to his side, hugging his waist from behind…\nQiu Tong buried her face in his broad back and comforted him softly, “After tomorrow, I’ll listen to you and Shao An regarding everything!”\nJin Yang closed his eyes tightly. He pushed her away and removed an exquisite pistol from his waist, handing it to her along with the magazine.\nThis gun was specially customized for Jin Yang. The trajectory had been improved by professionals, and the speed at which it was fired was 0.5 seconds faster than a normal gun. The trigger position had also been adjusted and fixed.\nIt had never left Jin Yang’s side. He held her hand and said in a deep voice, “This is the last time.”\nQiu Tong raised her eyebrows gently and nodded in response.\nQiu Xingyuan, Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu hid behind the sofa. They pouted, their hearts heavy and nervous.\nQiu Xingyu couldn’t control her emotions. She ran barefoot to her mother’s side and hugged her waist. “Mommy!”\nQiu Xingqiao hesitated for a moment before pulling Qiu Xingyuan’s arm. The two of them pounced into Qiu Tong’s arms.\nThe three children surrounded her. Even without words, she could feel their concern.\n…\nThe next day at noon, Qiu Tong took the elevator to the 20th floor. The moment she stepped out of the elevator, she noticed that there were many bodyguards around her.\nThey all had the Vulture totem tattoo on the backs of their necks. Qiu Tong entere the office and saw Terrance flipping through a magazine.\nHearing footsteps, Terrence looked up at her with a smile.\n“I didn’t expect you to dare to come here…”\nA cold glint flashed across Terrence’s eyes, but she pretended to look at him in surprise and confusion. “What? Is there a problem with me coming to work?”\nYu Ge tapped his fingers on the table as he examined Terrence and Qiu Tong. He did not act rashly but just sat there as if he was watching a show. Terrence tugged at his tie and asked bluntly, “What on earth did you do in the office yesterday?! As Mr. Yu Ge’s personal bodyguard, how dare you do such sneaky things? Explain yourself!”\nQiu Tong frowned in surprise. She looked at Yu Ge and deliberately asked, “What did I do? Do you have any evidence?”\nQiu Tong had guessed that Yu Ge didn’t know about the secret room and the Liqing Corporation’s situation overseas. Therefore, Terrence was tricking her!\nIndeed, Terrence choked on his words.\nQiu Tong took this opportunity to instigate him. “Seeing how nervous Terrence is, I’m afraid that there must be some secret in this office that you are hiding from Yu Ge, right? As the General Manager, Yu Ge has been staying in the office for the past few days…”\n“All business processes require your signature. Yu Ge is clearly just a figurehead.”\nYu Ge’s expression instantly darkened.\nWhen she and Qiu Xingyu had sneaked into the secret room yesterday, she remembered to erase their fingerprints and footprints. Terrence couldn’t find any clues that pointed to them, which was why she dared to rebut him.\n“I used to think that Yu Ge was the boss and that being his bodyguard would be very profitable. Now it looks like… it’s all fake.”\nQiu Tong looked at Yu Ge with disdain. Her gaze was like a knife cutting into Yu Ge’s heart, causing him to rush to Terrence in agitation. “Is what she said true? Are you guys hiding anything from me?! I’m the boss!”\nYu Ge grabbed Terrence’s collar. His emotions were easily manipulated. Qiu Tong knew this very well. She picked up a nutshell on the coffee table and flicked it towards Yu Ge’s wound. The sharp pain instantly infuriated him.\n“Hurry up and separate them!”\nQiu Tong reminded the bodyguards standing beside her, and they instantly went over.\nShe took the opportunity to retrieve the notebook hidden in the bookshelf. Qiu Tong stood at the door and crossed her arms.. When she met Yu Ge’s eyes, she said lightly, “Come and find me again when you have true control in the Liqing Corporation and make Terrence listen to your orders.”",

      "content": "Chapter 264: Stupid Fellows\nAt the fountain garden of the Liqing Corporation, Shu Xian and Lin Shan were squatting on the opposite side of the road with a group of men, waiting for Qiu Tong to appear.\nChen Jia sat in the car parked in the shadows. She observed her surroundings vigilantly, unwilling to miss any suspicious figures.\nAfter yesterday’s failure, she would never allow any mistakes to her plan again!\nShu Xian rolled down the window and casually flicked the cigarette butt outside. He stared at Chen Jia with a lecherous gaze and wanted to flirt with her.\nSitting beside him, Lin Shan could tell what he was thinking. She hurriedly threw herself into his arms and whispered coquettishly, “Don’t worry, it will definitely go smoothly today.”\nChen Jia controlled her disgusted expression and said indifferently, “I hope so.”\nIf she had any other choice, she would never collaborate with these two extremely stupid fellows!\nTwo days ago, Chen Jia met Shu Xian under Lin Shan’s guidance. She convinced Shu Xian to help them target Qiu Tong by promising him the piece of government land. Chen Jia had secretly investigated and found out that Qiu Tong had been frequenting this office building recently, so she asked Lin Shan and Shu Xian to find a group of people to create trouble at the company.\nHer original goal was to force her to stop working and kidnap her…\nHowever, Chen Jia never expected that this stupid b*tch, Lin Shan, would get into a fight with Yu Ge and be thrown out of the door by the Liqing Corporation’s bodyguards! She looked at the rearview mirror resentfully, wishing she could throw Lin Shan and Shu Xian out. Chen Jia clenched her fists and tried her best to suppress her emotions.\nQiu Tong soon walked out of the building.\nThe crossroad was blocked by a car accident. It would take some time for Shao An to drive around it. Qiu Tong stood at the intersection and waited.\nChen Jia turned around and gave Lin Shan and Shu Xian a look. They immediately opened the car door and ran to Qiu Tong’s side.\nShu Xian grabbed her elbow forcefully and pushed her towards the vehicle opposite the road.\nQiu Tong was taken aback by the sudden turn of events. She was stunned and flustered for a moment, but quickly calmed down. When she saw Shu Xian and Lin Shan, she thought of the figures she saw flashing past the office yesterday. She asked in surprise, “It’s you two?!”\nThe Liqing Corporation was located in a bustling city center, and passers-by quickly surrounded them.\nShu Xian shouted hoarsely, “Come home with me quickly! Don’t embarrass yourself outside again!”\nQiu Tong frowned and stared at Lin Shan, not understanding what they were playing at.\nLin Shan met her gaze and immediately said to the passers-by in an exaggerated tone, “She’s my sister-in-law. We found out that she was having an affair. She actually wanted to elope with the family money!”\n“Tell us, should she go back with us to explain things clearly?”\nQiu Tong looked at the car hidden in the shadows and instantly understood their intentions.\nThey actually fabricated such a ridiculous lie to kidnap her?\nA mocking smile appeared on Qiu Tong’s lips as she pushed Lin Shan away. She then grabbed Lin Shan’s hair and leaned over to whisper in her ear, “When will you be able to use your brain?”\n“The police station is less than 200 meters away. We can go there to discuss this.”\nAfter several confrontations with Qiu Tong, Lin Shan subconsciously felt a sense of fear towards her. Lin Shan desperately signaled to Shu Xian with her eyes, wanting him to help.\nShu Xian waved his hand, wanting to get the men lying in ambush to rush over.\nThe security department of the Liqing Corporation sensed that something was wrong in the garden. They took out their batons and rushed over.\nQiu Tong deliberately exposed her location to attract the attention of the security guards. She then placed her hat on Lin Shan’s head and hit the back of her neck. Lin Shan instantly fell to the ground in a daze.\nShao An drove to the appointed place and was about to get out of the car when he saw the chaos in front of him.\nQiu Tong fiddled with her loose curls as she pulled open the door to the front passenger seat. She raised her eyebrows at him and said, “Let’s go.”\nShao An nodded in confusion but immediately started the car. They passed by the Liqing Corporation building and saw the two groups of people fighting. They felt that it was comical and ridiculous.\nOn the other side of the road, Chen Jia was so angry that she smacked the steering wheel.\nShe gritted her teeth and scolded, “They’re all useless!”\n…\nQiu Tong successfully returned to the villa with the notebook. Everyone was immersed in a happy and joyful atmosphere.\nKe Le suggested making dumplings to celebrate, and everyone quickly agreed.\nQiu Xingyu waved her arms excitedly as she ran to the kitchen and sprinkled the entire bag of flour on the counter. Looking at her kitten-like face, Qiu Tong couldn’t help smiling. She gently dusted the flour off her head.\nJin Yang carried Qiu Xingqiao to wash his hands, before leading Qiu Xingyuan and Ye Luan to make dumplings.\nThe sunset in the forest was dazzling. Through the French windows, Qiu Tong looked at the serious expressions on Jin Yang and the children’s faces. From the corner of her eye, she glanced at the notebook placed in the living room. How long could this comfortable life last? They couldn’t be sure.\nQiu Xingyu handed a weird-shaped dumpling to Qiu Tong as if she was presenting a treasure, hoping to receive praise.\nQiu Tong watched as the stuffing flowed out onto her hands. She forced a smile and stroked her face. “Little Yu, bring your brothers to the living room to play, okay? Mommy and Uncle Jin Yang will call you when we are done…”\nIf they continued to mess around, tonight’s dinner would probably only be served tomorrow!",

Qiu Xingyu stepped on the dining chair as she fought with Qiu Xingqiao for the dumplings.\nWith a smile, Qiu Tong refilled Qiu Xingyuan and Ye Luan’s plates, before using a napkin to wipe the soy sauce stains on Qiu Xingyu’s lips. Qiu Xingyu patted her plump belly and looked up at Qiu Tong. “Is Mommy not hungry?”\nJin Yang looked up at her. She hadn’t eaten anything.\nSensing his gaze, Qiu Tong explained, “Mommy ate all the dumplings Little Yu made when I was cooking.”\nQiu Tong had eaten all the weird-shaped dumplings that Qiu Xingyu made.\nQiu Xingyu lifted her chin proudy. She glanced at Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao while swinging Qiu Tong’s hand, as if she was showing off to them.\nAt the dining table, Shao An and Ke Le raised their glasses to toast each other, expressing their appreciation and admiration for each other. Jin Yang also drank two glasses of wine in high spirits. Qiu Xingyu looked at the cartoon playing on the television screen and suddenly thought of something. She held Jin Yang and Qiu Tong’s hands and placed them together.\nQiu Xingyu blinked and said seriously, “Can Mommy and Uncle Jin Yang give me a younger sister?”\nHer childish voice was crisp and clear. The dining room instantly fell silent as everyone stared at Qiu Tong and Jin Yang.\nQiu Tong coughed awkwardly. She wanted to cover Qiu Xingyu’s mouth, but the little brat struggled free. She frowned and complained. “I’m the youngest in the family. My older brothers always scold me and I have to listen to them…”\n“If Uncle Jin Yang and Mommy can give me a little sister, I can become an older sister then!”\n“She will be the youngest child in the family. I can lecture her and tell her not to eat too much candy or her teeth will rot!”\nQiu Xingyu was innocent and naive. Qiu Tong had no choice but to gloss over this subject.\nLate into the night, Qiu Tong did the washing up in the kitchen before dragging her tired body back to the bedroom on the second floor. Just as she pushed open the door, she smelled a faint fragrance. Her back was pressed against Jin Yang’s burning chest. She turned to meet Jin Yang’s deep and drunken eyes.\nJin Yang carried her to the bed and said in an ambiguous and hoarse voice, “I think we should fulfill Little Yu’s wish.”\nQiu Tong couldn’t help laughing when she saw him pretending to be serious. She didn’t resist as she hooked her arms around his neck and lifted her hand to unbutton his shirt. The light was dim. Qiu Tong’s fingertips tugged at his shirt as she curled her index finger and threw it to the ground. Jin Yang’s firm muscles intoxicated her…\nJin Yang bent down to kiss her lips, but she pushed him away with a sly smile and pressed him onto the bed.\nQiu Tong was a good student. She remembered Jin Yang’s previous moves and imitated them.\nHer nimble tongue licked Jin Yang’s Adam’s apple and gently bit at his collarbone. Jin Yang panted as he supported her slender waist with his hands and slowly moved them down to her plump buttocks. He kneaded them and the pleasure made her moist.\nJin Yang narrowed his eyes. He raised his hand and tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear so that he could see her expression.\nAs if sensing his intentions, Qiu Tong deliberately licked her red lips with the tip of her tongue, deliberately provoking him. She slowly bent down to kiss Jin Yang’s tight abs, using her warm hand to gently hold his erection.\nQiu Tong smiled wickedly as she rubbed him.\nJin Yang took a deep breath as his eyes darkened.\nQiu Tong giggled. From the corner of her eye, she saw a shallow scar on Jin Yang’s waist. She hadn’t noticed it before. She slowed down her movements and asked with a pained expression, “How did you get that scar?”\n“I forgot.” Jin Yang picked her up and placed her gently under him. “I’ve encountered many dangers. There are two scars from knife wounds on my back and a closed bullet hole at my waist. There are also shrapnel pieces in my body…”\nQiu Tong frowned and covered Jin Yang’s thin lips, wanting to stop him.\nJin Yang took the opportunity to kiss her palm and caress her hair.\nHe then took advantage of her distraction to spread her legs apart and move in.\n“None of those are important. Perhaps I had to get all these scars to meet you…”\nA smile flashed across Jin Yang’s eyes. These words were like stones striking Qiu Tong’s heart.\nShe wrapped her arms around Jin Yang’s neck as a bewitching moan escaped from her lips. They moved rhythmically.\nA burning sensation shot into her body as a thought surfaced in her mind. Perhaps it wasn’t a bad idea to give Little Yu a younger sister.\nJin Yang seemed to have read her mind. After a short rest, he continued to work tirelessly…\n“Do it a few more times so that our chances of success will be higher!”\nJin Yang was nibbling on Qiu Tong’s earlobes as he whispered those seductive words.",

      "content": "Chapter 266: S City Prison Visit\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nThe next morning, Qiu Tong woke up and walked to the living room, feeling slightly tired and her waist aching.\nJin Yang sat with his back facing the stairs. Qiu Tong rubbed her sleepy eyes and said reproachfully, “You sure recover quickly…”\nAs soon as she said that, she saw Shao An and Ke Le standing opposite Jin Yang. They were holding the name list for the patrol shift. Cheeky smiles spread across their faces. Qiu Tong’s face instantly turned red with embarrassment. She lifted her leg and kicked Kohler lightly as she whispered, “Get lost!”\nKe Le chuckled as he led the mercenaries out to patrol the area. Qiu Tong glared at him with a frown.\nOn the weekend, Shao An accompanied her to S City Prison.\nWhen the warden heard the news of their arrival, he was so nervous that he hurriedly tidied up his office and arranged his outfit in front of the mirror, before waiting respectfully at the door. From time to time, he would run his hand through his hair and peer out.\nQiu Tong shook his hand politely. Sitting on the leather sofa, the warden brewed hot tea and handed it to her in an ingratiating manner.\nShao An stood beside her with his hands behind his back. He stared straight ahead, his entire body emitting an intimidating aura.\nNervous, the warden mentally reviewed his recent work. There shouldn’t be any mistakes. He was so anxious that his hands were trembling. “Is there something the President needs? Please feel free to tell me. The S City prison will definitely cooperate. Please don’t worry.”\nQiu Tong sipped the hot tea and looked up at the warden with indifferent eyes. She said gently, “Don’t be nervous.”\n“I came here today for a private matter. It has nothing to do with anyone else.”\nWhen the warden heard her words, he glanced at Shao An nervously.\nAs the president’s personal guard, how could Shao An appear at any other place? Shao An must have followed the president’s orders to protect her. What on earth was so important?\nQiu Tong did not delay any longer. She took out two cheques from her bag and pushed them toward the warden.\n“These are two cheques for five million yuan. You can cash them at any bank.”\n“I want to bail out my father, Qiu Rong. I’ve asked you about this procedure a while ago…”\nThe warden looked shocked. He stood up in a panic and returned the cheques. His gaze drifted to Shao An as he explained. “That rule is no longer effective. We know that there are loopholes in our management, and we have been trying our best to improve the situation in the prison recently. We will never allow anyone to bail out criminals through private connections!”\n“Please rest assured, Mr. President and Miss Qiu. Yu Ge’s situation will never happen again.”\nThe warden misunderstood Qiu Tong’s intentions and hurriedly bowed.\nQiu Tong rubbed her forehead awkwardly and took two more sips of the hot tea. Afraid that he wouldn’t believe her, she said sincerely, “I really want to bail out my father. Can you make an exception?”\nShao An frowned as he glanced at the warden. The warden hesitated.\nThe warden tapped on his laptop in a dilemma. He searched for the system records and handed them to her.\n“We have already fixed the earlier bail loophole in the prison. We created a system to log in information about the prisoners. Now, all the information is public and transparent.”\n“It will probably be a little difficult to secretly reduce a prisoner’s sentence.”\nThe warden explained the situation with difficulty. Seeing the disappointment on Qiu Tong’s face, he added with a hint of fear, “But we can think of other ways. For example, we send a list of candidates to have their prison sentences reduced to the capital every few months.”\n“We just need to wait for the right time.”\nQiu Tong had no intention of making things difficult for the warden. She nodded and thanked him softly, “Thank you for your help.”\n“Can I meet him?”\nThe warden heaved a sigh of relief. He had arranged for the prison guard to bring Qiu Rong to the visitor’s room. Qiu Tong couldn’t help tearing up at the sight of him. She looked at his weathered hands and said in a low voice, “Wait for a little longer. I’ll definitely bring you out.”\nQiu Rong touched her cheek and shook his head gently. “It’s alright, I am fine.”\nQiu Tong signaled Shao An to lead the prison guards out, giving them some privacy. She then hinted at Qiu Rong, “I went back to the old residence to take a look and found some notes you left behind.”\n“But it seems like someone has secretly copied your notes. The information in your notes has spread quite widely. I’m a little worried.”\nQiu Tong held Qiu Rong’s hand and traced the word “human” on his palm. Qiu Rong was instantly agitated and wanted to speak, but Qiu Tong shook her head to gestured for him to calm down. At the same time, she looked at the surveillance camera in the room and said in a voice that only the two of them could hear, “I’m afraid someone will secretly retrieve this surveillance video. Play along with me!”\nQiu Rong nodded solemnly. His turbid eyes seemed to glow as if there was a ray of light blooming from the center.. His entire body started to radiate vitality.",

He is safe with us. Don’t worry.”\nQiu Tong dipped her finger in some water and traced the word “Ye” on the table at a spot where the cameras couldn’t see.\nQiu Rong quickly guessed what she meant. He was so agitated that tears welled up in the corners of his eyes. He said in a choked voice, “Okay, take care of him for me!”\nShao An was standing guard outside. Qiu Tong looked back at him and quietly frowned.\nThe warden of S City was personally picked by Jin Yang and could be considered a trusted aide.\nEven though he was short-sighted when it came to handling many things, he was trustworthy and they did not need to be so guarded against him.\nHowever, Qiu Tong still felt uneasy. There were many prison guards in the prison, and it was unknown if their backgrounds were clean. They couldn’t make any mistakes now. The slightest carelessness would result in an irreversible mistake.\nThe clock on the wall ticked as Qiu Tong took out two bags of powder and syringes and stuffed them into his palm.\n“Qiu Xingyuan recently developed this drug. You should be able to discern the effects. Keep it close to you!”\nQiu Rong narrowed his eyes and understood what she was worried about. He smiled lovingly and patted her shoulder.\nThe relationship between the father and daughter was gradually growing closer.\nIt was time to end the visit. The prison guard helped Qiu Rong stand up and sent him back to the cell. In handcuffs and ankle cuffs, Qiu Rong looked back at her from time to time as he dragged his heavy feet. He raised his arm to signal her to leave quickly.\nTears glistened in her eyes. Just as she was about to stand up and leave, she subconsciously felt that something was wrong.\nAcross the long corridor, Qiu Tong stared at the prison guard beside Qiu Rong for a long time. His back view and actions seemed familiar…\n…\nOutside the prison, Qiu Tong and Shao An drove off. A figure walked out of the shade and sent the photos taken secretly to the capital.\nChen Jia took off her sunglasses and a mask that covered half of her face. She dialed Jin Tao’s number. “Sir, Qiu Tong talked to Qiu Rong in the S City prison for half an hour. I’ll think of a way to get the surveillance cameras in the visitor room and figure out her motives.”\nJin Tao sat in the study, tapping the mouse as he flipped through several photos from different angles.\nHe said in an emotionless tone, “You don’t have to worry about the prison. Continue to cause trouble for Qiu Tong according to the plan. No matter how simple the trick is, as long as it can mess up her plans and affect her, it’s enough.”\n“I’ll let you return to the capital once this matter is settled. Wait for my news and don’t act rashly.”\nChen Jia was a little confused, but she agreed to carry out Jin Tao’s orders.\nAt the old residence in the capital, Jin Tao threw the photos into the bottom drawer of a table. “I didn’t expect them to connect all the clues together. They actually found the prison so quickly?” He played with the pen in his hand and jabbed his temples with his fingertips, a playful smile appearing in his eyes.\nHalf an hour later, in the prison lounge in S City, a man in a prison guard uniform received a call. He quietly went out to answer it.\nJin Tao informed him coldly, “Do it tonight. Don’t be too ruthless. Leave him alive.”\nThe prison guard asked curiously, “Sir, his daughter is already thinking of a way to bail him out. If he leaves the prison, it will be very unfavorable for us. Why don’t we take the opportunity to kill him and cut off any future troubles?”\nJin Tao was silent for a moment on the other end of the line. His voice was authoritative. “Just follow my orders!”\n“Only by creating an opportunity for Qiu Tong to bring him out will we have a chance to obtain the information for the second half of the modification plan.”\n“Qiu Rong can help us perfect the drug. What do you know?! Don’t ruin my plan, understand?!”\nAnger and killing intent flashed across Jin Tao’s eyes. The prison guard trembled as he answered, “Yes, I understand.”\nQiu Rong hid in a corner of the cell as he analyzed the drug Qiu Tong had given him. He sniffed twice and a gratified smile appeared on his face. It seemed like Qiu Xingyuan’s chemistry expertise had reached a new level. He was indeed his grandson!\nQiu Rong quietly dissolved the powdered drug that could paralyze one’s limbs into the syringe. He hid it in his sleeve and laid in bed.\nOn the other side, Qiu Tong had returned to the villa to prepare dinner for the children.\nAs she held the sharp kitchen knife, her mind wandered for some reason. She accidentally cut her finger and bled a lot.\nJin Yang was worried about her and asked her to rest in the living room. Qiu Tong wanted to pour some warm water for Qiu Xingyu, but she was too distracted and didn’t hold the cup properly. The cup shattered on the ground…\nAs she stared at the glass shards all over the ground, her heart felt as if it was being tugged at and she couldn’t breathe.\nShe had an ominous feeling. Jin Yang hugged her and patted her back gently to comfort her.\nIn the next second, an ear-piercing ringtone sounded in the villa. Qiu Tong looked at the caller ID.. It was from the prison. She stood up abruptly…",

      "content": "Chapter 268: At The Hospital\nThere was news from the prison that Qiu Rong had been accidentally injured and had been sent to the hospital for treatment.\nWithout even changing her clothes, Qiu Tong grabbed her coat and put it on before running out into the courtyard in her slippers.\nJin Yang motioned for Shao An to drive her to the hospital while he rushed to the prison to investigate the situation. The winding mountain road in the deep forest seemed exceptionally long at this moment. Qiu Tong urged softly, “Hurry up, hurry up.”\nShao An was sitting straight up and he gritted his teeth as he stepped on the accelerator. He drove through countless red lights towards the hospital.\nThe hospital’s red emergency lights were flashing in the distance. The car was still moving when Qiu Tong pulled the door open and jumped out.\nShe stumbled and almost fell, but quickly regained her balance. According to the instructions on the reception desk, Qiu Tong looked for the nurse and asked anxiously, “Where is the patient sent from S City Prison?”\nThe nurse was so frightened that she raised her hand and pointed at the emergency room at the end of the corridor. Qiu Tong thanked her. When she saw the warden pacing back and forth nervously, she frowned and rushed over. She asked, “What happened?!”\nThe warden’s face turned pale. He rubbed his hands together and wanted to explain, but he couldn’t.\nThe emergency room door was pushed open. The nurses and doctors took off their masks and shook their heads gently. A bed covered in a white sheet appeared in front of her. Her legs went soft as she knelt on the ground. Her body trembled non-stop as she muttered with reddened eyes, “Impossible!”\n“Think of another way…”\nQiu Tong thought of her special ability. She waved the nurse’s hand away and ran to the bed without hesitation.\nShe wanted to use her special ability to save Qiu Rong’s life!\nWhen Shao An rushed over and saw the state that Qiu Tong was in, he hurriedly held her back. He turned around and shouted at the doctor, “What are you standing there for?”\n“Come and help!”\nThe hospital was in a mess. A confused voice was heard at the end of the corridor. “Tongtong? What’s wrong?”\nQiu Tong turned around stiffly. Qiu Rong’s prison uniform was stained with large amounts of blood. His arm was wrapped in thick gauze, and there were stitches on his brow bone. His left leg was also a little stiff, but he was still standing in front of her!\nThe warden said timidly, “Mr. Qiu’s life is not in danger. That’s another patient in the operating theater…”\nShao An stared at him with a frown. When Qiu Rong brought them back to his ward, Qiu Tong felt her vision grow dim and her head spin. She tried her best to calm herself down and asked, “Dad, what happened in the prison?”\nQiu Rong picked up the syringe on the bed, his eyes filled with relief and fear.\n“Not long after you left, a prison guard secretly came to my cell. I remembered your advice and pretended to be asleep to deceive him. I wanted to see what he wanted to do to me. I didn’t expect him to have the intention to kill!”\nQiu Rong looked at the wound on his arm. He was afraid that Qiu Tong would worry so he did not describe the fight in detail.\nHowever, Qiu Tong could still see the seriousness of the situation from the wounds on his body. The knife wounds on Qiu Rong’s legs were very deep. The wound on his brow bone was clearly caused by a heavy object. If he had dodged just a second slower, he would have been severely injured and fallen unconscious.\nSeeing her biting her lips, Qiu Rong raised his hand and gently patted the top of her head. He smiled and said, “Thankfully, I had Qiu Xingyuan’s drug.”\n“It was the drug which saved me. I injected all the drug into the guard’s body. That prison guard should still be unconscious. You need to quickly go and…”\nQiu Rong reminded as he glanced at Shao An. He nodded and left the ward to contact Jin Yang.\nThe warden quietly pushed the door open and entered. He looked at her apologetically, his face pale and ashen.\n“Miss Qiu, that prison guard was hired five years ago. There was no problem with his background information. We had no idea he would do such a thing! For this, I’m deeply sorry…”\n“But don’t worry. The prison will definitely cooperate with the investigation. We will not hide anything.”\nThe warden glanced at Qiu Rong and handed a document over. He continued. “Mr. Qiu Rong is seriously injured, and it completely fits the prison’s approval criteria for bail. I’ve already helped you settle the paperwork in advance. As long as you sign it, Mr. Qiu can leave with you guys. All of this is in accordance with the rules.”\nQiu Tong frowned slightly. She was a little confused and couldn’t tell if it was a bad thing or a good thing that Qiu Rong was injured.\nShe scanned through the contents of the bail document and signed it before leaving with Qiu Rong. The hospital was not a completely safe place. If the other party could infiltrate the prison, they could also disguise themselves as hospital staff to get close to Qiu Rong!\nOnly the villa in the deep forest was safe.\nQiu Tong didn’t dare to trust anyone other than Jin Yang…\nIn the quiet car, Qiu Tong held Qiu Rong’s hand tightly. She secretly transmitted a faint but steady dose of her special ability to help him recover.\nQiu Rong felt a warm current flowing through his palm endlessly, making him feel indescribably comfortable.\nHis brows relaxed, but he didn’t forget to comfort Qiu Tong. He patted the back of her hand gently. “Don’t worry, I’m fine. My body is very strong and I only have superficial wounds. I’ll be fine very soon.”\nQiu Tong had overspent her special ability. She nodded tiredly and gave a faint smile..",

      "content": "Chapter 269: Family Reunion\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nThe cold night was bone-chilling.\nWhen Qiu Tong and Qiu Rong reached the villa, they saw Qiu Xingyuan, Qiu Xingqiao and the rest waiting outside with flashlights in their hands.\nWhen Qiu Xingyu saw the car driving into the courtyard, she ran over and waved her arms as she shouted, “Mommy!”\nShao An slowed the car down. Ye Luan carried Qiu Xingyu to a safe area.\nQiu Tong saw that the children’s faces were red from the cold. Clearly, they had been waiting for them outside for a long time.\nWhen Ke Le received the news, he pushed over the wheelchair that he had prepared earlier and let Qiu Rong sit in it. He scratched his head and explained, “When Boss called, they were all eavesdropping. I advised them to wait in the house, but they refused.”\nQiu Xingyu sniffed and threw herself into Qiu Rong’s arms. “I miss Grandpa so much. I wanted to see Grandpa as soon as possible!”\nShe bumped against Qiu Rong’s wounded arm and he instinctively winced.\nQiu Xingyuan could tell that something was wrong and hurriedly pulled her off. “Grandpa seems to be injured. Be careful!”\nQiu Tong urged the whole family to return to the villa. Qiu Rong narrowed his eyes as he sized up the building that resembled a base in the mountains.\nCountless sentries were hidden along the mountain road. Guards with real guns numbered in the hundreds. The glass windows of the villa were all bulletproof. According to the construction blueprint, there was also a basement that could withstand missile attacks. Qiu Tong had raised three children on her own. How did she manage to arrange all this?\nQiu Rong sized up Shao An with a scrutinizing gaze. It was obvious that he was from the army and had a high status.\nWhen he was at the hospital, he could talk to the warden directly. The warden was also very respectful to him.\nQiu Rong thought of everything that had happened previously. Just as he was about to ask, the door to the villa opened. Jin Yang appeared in his line of sight. The guards behind him were carrying the unconscious prison guard. “Bring him to the basement and stand guard over him.”\nAfter giving his instructions, Jin Yang walked to Qiu Tong’s side and gently held her hand. He greeted Qiu Rong. “Hello, Uncle Qiu.”\nQiu Rong widened his eyes. Although he had guessed that Qiu Tong had some dealings with Jin Yang, he didn’t expect their relationship to be so intimate!\nQiu Xingyu didn’t notice the tense atmosphere. She hugged Jin Yang’s leg coquettishly and looked up innocently. “Grandpa is moving in too. Our whole family is reunited! Uncle Jin Yang’s body is so cold! I will warm you up!”\nQiu Xingyu held Jin Yang’s large palm with her chubby hands. Qiu Rong’s emotions were indescribably complicated.\nHe frowned as he sized up Qiu Tong and Jin Yang.\nQiu Tong thought for a moment and explained, “We encountered some trouble and have to stay here for the time being. Jin Yang and I are husband and wife now. There have been many things that happened between us that I can’t explain to you in just a few words.”\nMarried?!\nQiu Rong was so agitated that he slammed the armrest of his wheelchair. He pointed at Jin Yang and said, “How can the president marry a civilian?”\n“Tongtong, he’s definitely lying to you! Jin Tao… why would his family accept you?”\nQiu Rong was in a fluster. Jin Yang looked at him suspiciously and inquisitively.\nWhy did he feel that Qiu Rong knew him and Jin Tao very well?\nJin Yang had his doubts but didn’t express them in public. Instead, he tightened his grip on Qiu Tong’s hand. “Uncle Qiu, my feelings for her are serious. Please don’t worry.”\nQiu Rong was abnormally angry and wanted to separate Jin Yang and Qiu Tong. When Qiu Xingyu saw Qiu Rong’s face had turned red from anger, she ran to his side with sparkling eyes. “Grandpa, don’t be angry! I will care for you. Your wound will recover soon.”\n“Uncle Jin Yang treats Mommy and us very well! I like him a lot. Grandpa, don’t hate him, okay?”\nQiu Xingyu was very sensitive and considerate. She could feel Qiu Rong’s dislike for Jin Yang.\nShe pouted and shook Qiu Rong’s arm ingratiatingly. She also gestured to Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao to help.\nThey surrounded Qiu Rong with awkward expressions and deliberately talked about other topics to distract him.\nClanging sounds came from the kitchen. Ye Luan walked out clumsily with two bowls of ginger soup.\nHe looked at Qiu Rong with bright eyes and handed him the ginger soup. “Grandpa Qiu, have some to warm your stomach. Auntie Qiu, you too…”\nQiu Rong looked at Ye Luan’s eyes, which were very similar to his old friend. He touched his head with reddened eyes. “Good child, you’ve suffered! Your father often told me about you. You’re his greatest pride in life!”\n“He said that you have astonishing talent in biology. He mentioned to me many times that he wants you to join this profession.”\nQiu Rong had been in prison for many years and guessed that Ye Luan’s father must have already passed away. He looked at the boy with even more pity and love.\nWhen Ye Luan heard his words, he finally couldn’t control his emotions. He hugged Qiu Rong and wailed.\n“Grandpa Qiu, I miss him so much. I miss my father so much…”\nQiu Tong and Jin Yang stood by the side.. When they saw that Ye Luan had finally let down his guard and revealed his inner thoughts, they couldn’t help being moved to tears too.",

      "content": "Chapter 270: Psychological Tactics\nIn the dark and dim basement, Shao An whipped the prison guard with a soft whip filled with thorns.\nThe prison guard spat out two mouthfuls of blood. He glared at Shao An and shouted hoarsely, “Come at me again! Is that all you’ve got? You’re just scratching an itch for me!”\nShao An raised his hand to tug at the collar of his shirt. He brushed the blood from his cheek and took out the dagger hidden in his military boots.\nThe prison guard’s chest was full of whip marks. His split flesh looked particularly terrifying.\nThe enclosed environment was filled with the smell of blood, as the prison guards provoked Shao An.\nJust as he was about to attack him again, Qiu Tong appeared at the staircase. She berated Shao An for his actions and reminded him coldly, “Don’t let him manipulate your emotions. He deliberately made you angry.”\nShao An was shocked. He cleaned up the stains on the floor and instructed the guards to turn on all the lights in the room.\nQiu Tong and Jin Yang sat opposite the prison guard. She said softly with a smile in her eyes, “It looks like you are quite smart. You know psychology? To be able to provoke Shao An like this, you are definitely no amateur.”\n“The warden said that you passed the test five years ago and have been hiding in S City Prison for many years. Could it be that your mission is just to kill Qiu Rong?”\n“Why is he worth exposing your identity? Qiu Rong is just an ordinary researcher, isn’t he?”\nQiu Tong stared at the prison guard, unwilling to let go of any changes in his expression.\nThe prison guard pressed the tip of his tongue against his teeth and sneered. “No matter how many times you ask me, I will answer the same. The other prisoners gave me money in exchange for more peaceful days, but Qiu Rong just had to go against me. There are so many deaths in the prison. I could make him go away just by using the excuse of a sudden illness. But I didn’t expect him to be able to escape me.”\n“You want to interfere in a private feud between a prison guard and an inmate?”\nThe prison guard laughed wildly. He was stubborn. Shao An narrowed his eyes and walked over, punching a wounded part of his body twice.\nQiu Tong remained calm. She knew very well that the more the prison guard wanted to provoke them, the more it proved that he knew a lot more information. He might have the clues they wanted.\nThe prison guard could not move in the basement. He wanted to commit suicide, but he couldn’t find a way.\nQiu Tong twirled her pen calmly and nodded in agreement. “Your explanation is flawless.”\n“The person behind you has brilliant methods. I have to admit your employment records in the prison were all done through proper channels. I couldn’t find any clues, but are you willing to accept this? Are you willing to be sacrificed as a pawn?”\nQiu Tong walked to the prison guard, while Jin Yang stood beside her, protecting her.\nThe prison guard’s eyes flickered. He looked away, not daring to meet Qiu Tong’s eyes. Shao An held his chin, forcing him to face her.\nQiu Tong’s eyes were filled with pity as she whispered, “You can clearly perform many more missions. Your skills are not bad. To be able to endure Shao An’s torture and refuse to betray your boss, you are truly loyal.”\n“But he treated you like an abandoned dog, arranging for you to go through a dull prison routine everyday for years. You were there just waiting to be used.”\n“Your only mission is to kill someone, a prisoner who can’t resist at all. Did your boss ever consider the possibility that you might fail? What are you to him? You’re like a dog that can be abandoned at any time, right?”\nThe prison guard wanted to use psychological tactics to court death, but Qiu Tong refused to let him succeed. As she spoke, her words pierced his heart. The man in front of her was already on the verge of collapse. Shao An looked at Qiu Tong in admiration as he swallowed silently and stared at Jin Yang guiltily.\nEven in such a tense moment, Shao An couldn’t help musing that if Jin Yang and Qiu Tong were to go against each other, who would win?\nSensing his gaze, Jin Yang narrowed his long, narrow eyes and turned around. Shao An cleared his throat and lowered his head.\nThe prison guard lowered his head weakly. Qiu Tong noticed an unusual scar on his skin!\nShe tore off the prison guard’s clothes. The prison guard struggled and the chains binding his hands rang out. Jin Yang raised his leg and kicked him in the stomach. Shao An and the guards also restrained him.\nQiu Tong touched the hideous scar with her hand and thought of the tattoo. “You’re from the Vulture Organization?”\nThe prison guard paused for two seconds before denying it.\nHowever, she could tell from his hesitation that she was right. Jin Yang handed her a handkerchief and she wiped the blood off her fingertips.\nA glint flashed across Qiu Tong’s eyes as she tried other methods to confuse the prison guard’s mental state. “I know a few people from the Vulture Organization. They said that only exiled soldiers will get rid of their tattoo. No wonder you were assigned to such a mission.”\nThe prison guard finally lost control. He spat blood at Qiu Tong. “Bullshit!”\n“I’m a top-notch killer! I was highly regarded and that was why I was assigned to go to S City Prison to keep an eye on that old fellow!”\nQiu Tong said happily, “I see.”\nThe prison guard realized that he had misspoken and wanted to salvage the situation, but it was already too late. He glared at the woman in front of him with hatred..",

      "content": "Chapter 271: Ring Token\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nThe prison guard looked at Qiu Tong in fear, afraid that she would dig up more information. He gritted his teeth and kept quiet.\nJin Yang motioned for Shao An to continue his torture. Qiu Tong looked at the prison guard’s silent stance and felt that something was wrong.\nShe carefully observed the changes in the prison guard’s expression and realized that when Shao An attacked his stomach, his expression would be that of unbearable pain. The body did not lie. Qiu Tong was reminded of the hooligan who wanted to kidnap the children. He had once swallowed an important thing for safekeeping.\nQiu Tong stood up abruptly. “Wait. Open his mouth and see if you can find anything?”\nShao An followed her instructions and slowly approached, but the prison guard’s expression suddenly became nervous and frightened. He was so frantic that he wanted to bang his head against Shao An to stop his search.\nQiu Tong was increasingly certain of her judgment. She said coldly, “Even if you commit suicide, I can dissect your corpse and retrieve the item.”\n“I advise you to save your strength and stop resisting. Perhaps you can preserve your life.”\nThe prison guard’s eyes were filled with the gloom of death. Shao An found a fishing line hooked between his teeth and pulled it… he washed the item with water and wrapped it with a tissue before handing it to Qiu Tong.\nIt was a ring. The acid in the guard’s stomach had corroded the material but Qiu Tong could still see the Vulture Organization’s symbol on it. Qiu Tong brought it out of the basement and found Ke Le. “Do you recognize this?”\nKe Le and the mercenaries surrounded her. “The ring might be a keepsake of the Vulture Organization. A killer we know in the Dark Web used to wear a pendant similar to this. It might be a symbol of the status of a soldier who has reached a certain level in the Vulture Organization.”\nQiu Tong and Jin Yang looked at each other. They seemed to have come near the edge of the foggy truth.\nThe children were already asleep. Jin Yang and Qiu Tong brought the mercenaries to the study and whispered solemnly, “What can you tell us regarding the Vulture Organization’s situation? Anything you can remember, tell us!”\nKe Le mulled over his memories. He scratched his head good-naturedly. “They’re all men driven to the brink. I’ve had very little contact with them.”\nOne of the mercenaries took two steps forward and said hesitantly, “I know a little!”\nKe Le looked back at him in shock. This mercenary’s code name was Skinny Monkey. He was one of the mercenaries who had followed Ke Le for the longest time. Ke Le dared to say that there were no secrets between them, so he didn’t expect Skinny Monkey to step out at this moment…\nSkinny Monkey gritted his teeth guiltily. “Three years ago, I was addicted to gambling.”\n“I hid it from Brother Ke Le and spent all my money on gambling. A group of gamblers played a trick on me and cheated me of all my money. They even tricked me into signing a huge loan contract. But I have already paid everything back now!”\nKe Le was so angry that he felt faint. He wanted to punch Skinny Monkey but restrained himself because of Qiu Tong and Jin Yang.\nSkinny Monkey continued, “I once met a few people from the Vulture Organization at a gambling den called Sent Bar. They keep a low profile and usually hide among the gamblers. I had some dealings with them because I borrowed from some loan sharks.”\n“They are extremely vigilant. Anyone who takes the initiative to contact and search for them will be secretly killed.”\n“The soldiers of the Vulture Organization are divided into many levels. Most of them only have a one-way communication with the organization and they don’t know each other’s identities. The rings and tattoos are the only ways to confirm their identity. That’s all I know…”\nSkinny Monkey looked at Ke Le and heaved a sigh of relief. All these years, he had always felt guilty for hiding something from him.\nAt this moment, the heavy stone that had been weighing on his heart for a long time was finally lifted. He felt more at ease.\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes and played with the ring in her palm. “The Sent Bar?” she muttered.\nJin Yang understood her intentions and wanted to snatch the ring away. However, Qiu Tong quickly stuffed the item into her clothes.\n“You can’t go!”\nQiu Tong looked at him with a faint smile. “You have a special status. You must not appear there or you will be in trouble if someone recognizes you.”\nJin Yang’s eyes were filled with gloom. He stared at her firm expression and said in a frustrated tone, “Let Shao An accompany you. I can feel more at ease then.”\n“No, as your personal guard, Shao An will also be highly-recognizable in places like this bar. It’s very dangerous.”\nQiu Tong looked up and pointed at an alert-looking boy in the President’s team. She smiled and said confidently, “Those guys can accompany me to the bar. I’ll discuss the specific plan of action with you. There won’t be any accidents.”\nJin Yang stood up angrily and left the study. Over the past few days, he had heard too many words like “absolutely” and “definitely”. However, behind these guarantees were countless dangers…\nHe was Qiu Tong’s husband and the president of his country.. Yet, he felt utterly powerless and tormented at this moment.",

Any slightest sound would be magnified.\nQiu Tong came out of the children’s room and was about to return to her bedroom to rest, she saw that the door to the guest room where Qiu Rong was staying was ajar. A shadow flashed past the dim room.\nFeeling uneasy, she walked softly to the door and pushed it open as she knocked on it.\nSitting on the wheelchair, Qiu Rong’s back view was still regal. He dropped his gaze, as if he was angry at her.\nQiu Tong pushed him to the bed and squatted down in front of him. She asked helplessly, “Dad, what are you angry about?”\nQiu Rong looked into her eyes, unable to speak.\nThere was no way to change Jin Yang’s identity. The longer Qiu Tong interacted with him and the deeper their relationship grew, the greater the pain they would suffer in the end. Qiu Rong knew very well that those high-ranking officials were used to sweet-talking and deceiving others. Their current promises were just an illusory bubble. He didn’t want to see his daughter get hurt again.\nWhile Qiu Tong and Jin Yang were interrogating the prison guard in the basement, Qiu Rong had played with the children.\nQiu Xingyu had been praising Jin Yang the whole time. Qiu Xingyuan had always been a boy of few words but he expressed his willingness to accept Jin Yang as their father. Qiu Rong felt even more uneasy. He wanted to persuade Qiu Tong to move out of the villa, but he didn’t know what to say.\nQiu Tong misunderstood his concern and said softly, “Dad, Jin Yang treats me very well.”\n“Previously, I avoided his good intentions because I felt that being associated with high officials would bring trouble. I’m not alone. I still have Qiu Xingyuan, Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu to take care of. I won’t be able to withstand…”\nQiu Rong nodded, but she continued, “But Jin Yang is different. He genuinely treats us well.”\n“And he has the ability to protect us. I know you’re afraid that I’ll get involved in danger, but you’ve seen what happened in prison!”\n“The human modification plan has already implicated the Qiu family. We can’t distance ourselves completely. All those forces want information on the plan. They chased after Ye Luan and even wanted to kill you. Do you still think we can hide? Where are we going to hide? Their reach is everywhere…”\nQiu Rong frowned in silence. He understood her reasoning, but he was unwilling to admit it.\nOver the years, he had kept all his secrets and hid in prison, trying to make the outside world forget it all, but it was clearly useless. The storm would not stop just for anyone.\nQiu Tong placed her face in Qiu Rong’s aged palm and rubbed it against him as if she was a child. “Dad, I don’t know what you’re worried about, but Jin Yang is trustworthy. I hope you can support and believe in my choice and slowly let time prove it…”\n“I will resolve this!”\nQiu Rong hugged her and sighed for a long time without saying anything else.\nBefore Qiu Tong left, Qiu Rong looked at her back profile and said softly, “I’m sorry, Tongtong. It’s Daddy’s fault.”\n…\nThree days later, Qiu Tong appeared at the entrance of the Sent Bar.\nShe looked beautiful and delicate. Her chestnut brown curly hair was draped over her collarbone, and her sexy leather jacket outlined her graceful figure. The moment she appeared, she attracted countless hooligans to whistle at her, becoming the focus of the bar.\nThe waiter guided her to the bar counter. “Hello, Miss. Is this your first time here?”\nQiu Tong took out a few bills and gently kissed them, leaving behind traces of lipstick. She then stuffed them into the waiter’s collar. She said charmingly, “A friend introduced me. He said that you have a place here where you can gamble. Can you bring me there, handsome?”\nThe waiter’s ears turned red and he was in a fluster as he led Qiu Tong to the casino on the second floor.\n“You can exchange your chips here and choose a gambling table.”\n“But you’d better not try the roulette. The stakes there are very high. Every night, many gamblers end up owing huge debts.”\nThe waiter spoke softly. He had good intentions and couldn’t bear to see such a beautiful woman fall into the depths of gambling addiction.\nHowever, he didn’t expect Qiu Tong to walk straight towards the biggest betting counter.\nShe placed all her chips neatly on a number. The dealer was surprised by her action. Qiu Tong acted as if she didn’t notice his expression. She just twirled her hair with her fingers.\n“Let’s begin…”\nThe roulette wheel spun, and the gamblers held their breaths until it stopped. The number was as Qiu Tong predicted. The dealer pushed a thick stack of chips at her. “Congratulations, you’re very lucky.”\nQiu Tong picked up two chips and played with them between her fingers as she pushed the rest of chips to the same number again.\nThe surrounding gamblers gasped. They were all shocked by the stubbornness in her eyes. Even the dealer paused for a moment. It was rare for a gambler to dare to repeat her bet!\nQiu Tong could feel countless pairs of eyes secretly scrutinizing her. Her goal had been achieved. She grinned and said lightly, “It’s my lucky number. I believe it can bring me wealth.. Please begin.”",

      "content": "Chapter 273: Bo Lang’s Ambush\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nThe environment of the casino was extremely chaotic. Gamblers were shouting in a crude and ugly manner.\nNews that there was a beautiful woman at the roulette wheel quickly spread. Qiu Tong was slowly surrounded by drunk onlookers. After failing a few times, she only had a few chips left. The sleazy onlookers heckled her. “Beauty, stop playing!”\n“If you lose again, I’m afraid you’ll have to sell your body to the casino! We heard that the casino recently detained a few female guests who didn’t pay their debts and forced them to become strippers next door!”\nThe crowd roared with laughter at the story. The men stared at her lecherously, roving their eyes all over her body.\nQiu Tong looked up indifferently and pushed the remaining chips onto the table. “No need to worry about me!”\nThe wheel slowly came to a stop. Qiu Tong lost again.\nThe dealer took away all her chips and said apologetically, “Do you want to continue placing more bets? If you don’t have any more chips, you have to leave your seat as soon as possible to give others a chance.” Qiu Tong could see just how ruthless the casino was. She glanced at the president’s guard who had sneaked into the gambling den with her and rubbed her ears. It was their secret signal..\nThe guard caught her signal and raised his voice. “Beauty, do you have anything valuable on you? You can pawn it in the casino!”\n“You can redeem it after you earn back your money. Don’t give up!”\nIt was easy to instigate the other gamblers. They all echoed the guard’s words and even suggested things to Qiu Tong.\n“The necklace you’re wearing looks pretty good…”\nAnother guard approached her and pulled out the ring hanging on a chain hidden under her leather jacket. The ring with the Vulture Organization’s logo was exposed to everyone for about three seconds. Qiu Tong timed it precisely before stuffing the ring back into her clothes. “Don’t touch it!”\n“You’re not worthy!”\nQiu Tong then downed her drink and staggered out of the casino.\nIn a corner of the casino, a few people stood up and exchanged glances with each other before following Qiu Tong…\n…\nIn the dark and narrow alleyway outside the Sent Bar, Qiu Tong slowed her footsteps until she heard faint sounds behind her.\nA fist flew towards her, bringing with it a gust of cold air. Qiu Tong quickly bent down to dodge it. Stepping off the wall, she used the momentum to soar into the air and grabbed the other party’s neck with her legs, dragging him onto the ground. “Do you want money? Or sex?”\nA mocking smile appeared on her lips as she continued with killing intent in her eyes, “No matter what it is, provoking me tonight will be the death of you!”\nQiu Tong squeezed her legs together, wanting to strangle the burly man who had attacked her.\nHowever, four to five burly men rushed in from both sides of the alley. Seeing that the situation was not good, Qiu Tong took out a dagger that she carried with her and pulled the man up from the ground. She placed the sharp blade against the artery of his neck and said loudly, “Are you guys in cahoots? Don’t come over! Otherwise, I’ll kill him…”\nThe hostage held by Qiu Tong suddenly laughed and said hoarsely, “Good moves.”\nAs the dark clouds that blocked the moonlight dissipated, Qiu Tong saw an obvious scar on the burly man’s left eye. His pupils were dark blue and they looked a little strange when they moved. Taking advantage of her distraction, the burly man grabbed her knife and pried it away from his neck.\nBlood flowed down his palm and quickly formed a puddle on the ground.\nThe burly man seemed to not feel any pain as the others gathered around him. He grabbed Qiu Tong’s hair and pressed her to the ground.\n“The ring you are wearing around your neck, who does it belong to? Where did you get it?”\nThe burly man questioned Qiu Tong. She could feel the bones in her arm being twisted, nearly to the point of being dislocated\nHer forehead was covered in cold sweat from the pain, but she still gritted her teeth and cursed, “It’s mine! What do you care? Don’t even think about taking it away!”\nThe burly men laughed. They released Qiu Tong and she struggled to stand up, staring at them in confusion.\n“We’re all part of the same family.”\nThe burly man tore open his T-shirt to reveal the tattoo on his shoulder. Qiu Tong’s pupils dilated as she tried to identify it. “You guys were also split from the organization?”\nThe burly men exchanged glances and pointed at the dilapidated wine house in front of them. “This place isn’t suitable for a long chat. Let’s go over there to talk.” Qiu Tong did not move but just stared at them. The burly man in the lead looked at her in surprise.\nQiu Tong pointed at the ring in his hand. “Give that back to me.”\nRealization dawned on the burly man and he smiled. He threw the ring back to her. “I’m Bo Lang. What about you?”\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes and followed them with a disdainful expression. She answered in a faint voice, “Sally.”\nEveryone in the Vulture Organization used fake code names so Qiu Tong wasn’t afraid that they would investigate her. This was why she dared to toss out a fake name.\nBo Lang raised his eyebrows and smiled with an indifferent expression. “Your name suits you.”\nWhen they reached the winehouse, Bo Lang arranged for two of them to stand guard outside. He led Qiu Tong past the corridor with lanterns hanging on it. When they reached the backroom, Bo Lang closed the door and looked at her with a smile.. The scar on his left eye was particularly eye-catching.",

      "content": "Chapter 274: Interrogation\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\n“Which branch of the organization are you affiliated with? What mission are you carrying out in S City?”\nBo Lang took out two bottles of hard liquor from the liquor cabinet and waved them at her as he asked in a familiar manner.\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes at his actions and remained silent.\nBo Lang didn’t mind. The brown liquid flowed into two glass cups. He took out two white pills and tossed one in each. Dense bubbles instantly erupted in the glasses. This was probably one of the methods the Vulture Organization used to identify their members.\nBo Lang moved one of the cups closer to Qiu Tong. He wiped his thin lips with his thumb and said with a smile, “Truth serum.”\n“It’s a sort of stimulant. Give it a try? Members of the organization often complain it’s not stimulative enough!”\nBo Lang raised his head and downed his own cup, his hawk-like eyes staring fixedly at her.\nQiu Tong knew that she had to drink it. Otherwise, the burly men standing beside her would beat her up.\nShe raised her hand to twirl her hair as she secretly unscrewed the hidden mechanism in her hair clip and dipped her index finger in the transparent liquid inside.\nQiu Tong raised her glass and dipped her index finger in it before clinking glasses with Bo Lang and drinking it all.\nAs the hot alcohol flowed down her throat and into her stomach, Qiu Tong quickly felt dizzy. She forced herself to sit up straight and stare in Bo Lang’s direction with a cold smile. “I didn’t expect to be screened like this after being split from the organization for half a year. How ridiculous!”\nBo Lang raised his eyebrows and looked at her in doubt. “How did you get separated?”\nQuests covered her forehead with her hand and bit the tip of her tongue with her teeth, relying on the stabbing pain to maintain her consciousness. “The higher-ups have arranged for me to lie low, but ever since the mission was issued to me five months ago, there has been no contact. He might be dead. When I entered the organization, my status was low, so I couldn’t contact anyone else. I could only wander around S City, gamble, and try my best to survive, waiting to be activated at any time.”\nBo Lang’s blue left eye swiveled as he pointed at the ring hanging around her neck. “Is that yours?”\nQiu Tong shook her head. She remembered that Ke Le and the prison guard had both mentioned the rank of the ring. “The ring belongs to my handler.”\n“I stole it while he was drunk. I thought I would return it to him when I carried out a mission. I didn’t expect…”\nQiu Tong had chosen to win Bo Lang’s trust with honesty. Bo Lang took out his dagger and rubbed his fingers against the blade. He leaned back in his chair and stared at her. “Where is your tattoo?”\nThe room froze for a moment. Qiu Tong’s body swayed as she stood up, her eyes tearing as she opened the collar of her tight-fitting clothes in a flirtatious manner.\nThe dark green tattoo was eye-catching on her round and plump breasts. The surrounding burly men took deep breaths. Bo Lang only glanced at her briefly before gesturing for her to sit down. At the same time, he cleared his throat, indicating for everyone to restrain the filthy thoughts in their minds.\nAfter all, they were comrades. The burly men pushed open the windows and let the cold wind cool down their primitive instincts.\nQiu Tong slowly stuffed the ring back into her clothes. She had drawn the tattoo of the Vulture Organization from memory and got Jin Yang to draw it on her chest overnight. Only if it was drawn on an intimate part of her body would it prevent Bo Lang from examining it further.\nQiu Tong was right again!\nThe truth serum was very effective. Under the effects of the drug, Qiu Tong was unable to tell a meticulous lie. Bo Lang’s attitude towards her changed from suspicion to trust. He tossed some beef jerky in front of her and said hatefully, “The recent deployment in S City is very tight. We have also lost contact with the higher-ups. However, the organization focus has shifted from overseas to here. I believe there will be some big movements soon.”\n“Don’t worry. Since we have encountered each other, it’s considered fate!”\n“I’ll definitely inform you when our handlers need us to carry out a mission.”\nBo Lang raised his hand as Qiu Tong’s indifferent gaze met his.\nBo Lang then pried open his eyelids and took out one of his blue eyes. “It’s fake. This eye was blinded during a battle with the capital’s army. I will always remember this debt. I took the initiative to come here from overseas to seek revenge on the guy!”\nQiu Tong picked up her glass and took two sips before saying hoarsely, “It looks like he’s very powerful.”\nWhen Bo Lang saw her actions, his smile grew wider. He nodded and admitted, “He’s a very powerful opponent!”\n“It’s getting late. Where are you staying? I’ll get someone to send you back!”\nQiu Tong wanted to refuse, but Bo Lang stood up and stopped her protests. “You’re young and beautiful. The truth serum’s effects are still in play. I will feel guilty if you encounter any trouble on the way. No need to stand on ceremony with me!”\nWas this her final test? Qiu Tong smiled as she played with her curly hair. Her red lips parted slightly as she said, “Alright.”\nOutside the dilapidated wine house, Bo Lang stared at the back profiles of Qiu Tong and two other members of the organization.. He whispered to his assistant, “Do you think there’s a problem with her identity?” The assistant shook his head. Bo Lang stabbed a dagger into the wall and said coldly, “The more perfect her performance is, the more suspicious she is!”",

      "content": "Chapter 275: Expelling the Truth Serum\nGoing by the address provided by Qiu Tong, the dilapidated van was speeding towards the black market.\nQiu Tong sat in the back seat while two burly men sat in front. They could smell the faint fragrance emanating from her body, and their bodies were reacting. One of the men rolled down the car window, and the cold wind blew at her hair. Qiu Tong felt her mind return to clarity and rationality.\n“You’ve been in S City for so long. You never found a woman to settle your needs?”\nQiu Tong stared provocatively at the men. One of them was more shy and he kept swallowing as he shook his head.\nThe other burly man was more bold. He took the initiative to place his hand on Qiu Tong’s waist and pressed his face against her neck. He took a deep breath. “The organization sent us to S City for more than three months. We’ve been camping out near 730 Guangming Road every day. How would we have the time to find women?!”\n730?! Qiu Tong thought of Professor Dong’s laboratory. Could it be that his research had made some progress?\nQiu Tong suppressed her disgust and allowed the man to take advantage of her.\nShe asked tentatively, “Bo Lang is your superior?”\nThe shy man nodded. His body was tense as he stared at Qiu Tong, his hand covering the tent between his legs.\n“Bo Lang is a high-ranking member of the Vulture Organization. He personally led the team to S City to await instructions from the handler. We’ve been waiting for the handler’s signal. There should be news in a few days.”\n“Don’t be anxious. Since Bo Lang promised you that he will help you contact the organization again, he will definitely keep his promise.”\nThe burly man wanted to unbuckle his pants, but Qiu Tong avoided his touch and deliberately said in a cold tone, “I don’t believe anyone! You guys are at the casino every day. Perhaps you’re also abandoned by the organization!”\nThe shy man blinked. He wanted to kiss Qiu Tong’s. He blurted out. “Bo Lang spoke to our handler on the phone yesterday! They agreed to meet in half a month!”\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes and smiled now that she got the information she wanted from them.\nShe pointed at the dark alley in front of the van. “We are here.”\nShe gently pushed the two of them aside and jumped out of the van. She blew a seductive kiss at them and walked towards the building.\nThis was the residence of the gangsters who had abducted the children. Qiu Tong had instructed Jin Yang and Shao An to set up an ambush in advance.\nShe pushed the door open and entered the room, turning on the dim yellow electric light.\nThe van parked in front of the building for about 15 minutes before leaving the alley.\nQiu Tong hid behind the curtains. Her vision was a little blurry, and she could feel waves of heat emanating from her abdomen. Her body felt especially empty.\nThe colorless antidote Qiu Xingyuan had given her was able to break down and eliminate a portion of the drug, but the truth serum that Bo Lang had given her was extremely effective. The fact that she could endure until now was already more than she could bear.\nA soft sound rang out on the wooden floor. Qiu Tong vigilantly took out the dagger she carried with her. However, her hand was controlled by the other party, and the two of them struggled with each other.\nUnder the moonlight, Jin Yang’s handsome face appeared in Qiu Tong’s vision. She relaxed her strength and fell into his arms weakly.\n“Mr. President, Miss Qiu, they’ve already left. Are you alright?”\nShao An wanted to barge in, but Jin Yang shouted at him, “Get out! Close the door!…”\nJin Yang carried Qiu Tong and placed her on the simple foldable bed.\nQiu Tong’s face was red. She felt very hot as she tugged at her tights. When Jin Yang returned after drawing the curtains, she threw herself into his arms in her sexy undergarments. “Help me! I feel so uncomfortable, so hot…”\nJin Yang’s Adam’s apple bobbed. He sighed softly and pressed her against the foldable bed.\nHe placed her fair and slender legs on his shoulders and pushed himself into her. Due to the effects of the drug, her body was even more sensitive than before. She kept letting out soft moans as she called out Jin Yang’s name softly.\nThis undoubtedly stimulated Jin Yang. His muscles were covered in fine sweat.\nUnder the moonlight, he saw the love bites on her neck. A ruthless glint flashed across his eyes as he forced her to the corner of the bed.\nJin Yang held her hands and raised her arms high. He bent down and bit down heavily on her breasts.\nQiu Tong felt a numbing sensation spread throughout her body. She couldn’t help but tremble slightly. Jin Yang gritted his teeth as he resisted the urge. He stopped just when Qiu Tong was about to reach cloud nine.\n“Hurry up, Jin Yang. I want… you!”\nQiu Tong felt exceptionally empty. Her hands wrapped around Jin Yang’s neck like vines as she licked him with misty eyes. Jin Yang felt his scalp tingle. In the end, he lost control and continued to thrust.\nOnly when a thin fog appeared outside did Shao An finally hear Jin Yang say in a hoarse voice, “Bring the clothes over.”\nShao An straightened his back and wished he could close his eyes when he reached the door. He handed the two bags over and quickly turned around. “Sir, the car is already waiting outside. We can set off at any time!”\nJin Yang frowned silently. He helped Qiu Tong up and changed her clothes before leaving quietly..",

      "content": "Chapter 276: Pleasing His Father-In-Law\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nThe next afternoon, Qiu Tong was awakened from a nightmare.\nThe dazzling sunlight outside made it difficult for her to open her eyes. The effects of the truth serum and Jin Yang’s torment made her body ache and tired.\nThe extremely realistic nightmare made Qiu Tong panic. She wanted to turn over and sit up, but a pair of cold and delicate hands reached over and wiped the sweat off her forehead.\nQiu Tong turned around in surprise to see the children surrounding her. Their eyes were filled with worry.\nQiu Xingyuan pursed his lips and placed the thermometer in her mouth.\nQiu Tong waited for two minutes in a daze. She heaved a sigh of relief after he took it out and read the numbers carefully.\nQiu Xingyu pounced into her arms and rubbed her face coquettishly. “Mommy, you scared us all!”\nQiu Xingqiao nodded. “Uncle Jin Yang carried you back last night. He didn’t allow us to disturb you and said that you needed to rest.”\nQiu Tong recalled the intense battle last night and could understand the reasoning behind Jin Yang’s words.\nQiu Xingyu tugged at her pajamas. Her sparkling eyes caught a glimpse of the red mark on her neck as she rubbed it with her short fingers. “Mommy’s neck was bitten by a mosquito! I will stop the itch by applying some ointment on Mommy!”\nQiu Tong’s ears turned red at her childish words. She hurriedly carried them out of the room.\nBefore leaving, she took out a thin scarf from her closet and wrapped it around her neck. When she looked at herself in the mirror, the scarf did look rather out of place.\nIn the living room, Jin Yang and Shao An compared the photos of the members of the Vulture Organization they had taken last night. They found that no information could be found on them anywhere, even on the Dark Web.\nIt seemed that the Vulture Organization was much more powerful than they had imagined.\nQiu Tong carried Little Yu as she sat beside Jin Yang. He thoughtfully handed her a cup of tea.\nQiu Xingyu opened her arms coquettishly to let Jin Yang hug her. She tilted her head in confusion and stared at the red mark on Jin Yang’s Adam’s apple before turning to look at Qiu Tong again. “Eh? That’s strange! Why are the mosquitoes in the villa specifically biting Mommy and Uncle Jin Yang?”\nWhen Qiu Rong heard her words, he halted his footsteps and turned to carry Qiu Xingyu away.\nAs he did so, he shot Jin Yang a dirty look. Qiu Tong blinked at Jin Yang, who shrugged helplessly.\nIt seemed like it would take a long time for the President to get his father-in-law’s approval…\nQiu Tong summarized the information she garnered last night to Jin Yang and Shao An.\nThey could confirm that the Vulture Organization’s purpose in coming to S City was for the human modification plan. Bo Lang was a high-ranking member of the organization and Qiu Tong felt that he might be able to reach its core.\nJin Yang stared at the computer screen solemnly. He had a nagging feeling that things were going too smoothly.\n“Bo Lang is probably still suspicious about you. I’ll send someone disguised as you to hang around the area near the black market. I hope this can convince the other party…”\nJin Yang spoke in a determined manner. He would not let Qiu Tong take such a risk again.\nQiu Tong smiled and threw herself onto the sofa. She rubbed her temples and closed her eyes lazily.\n“Now, we can only wait for Bo Lang to contact me!”\n…\nIn the children’s room, the door was closed.\nThe four children, led by Qiu Xingyuan, sat around the bed. Imitating Qiu Tong and Jin Yang, they carried out their own meeting in a solemn manner. Qiu Xingyu raised her arm high and said sweetly, “Big Brother, Second Brother, Brother Ye Luan!”\n“Grandpa seems to hate Uncle Jin Yang very much. I’m afraid that Uncle Jin Yang will be chased away by Grandpa. Then, we won’t have a place to stay!”\n“Mommy will be very sad too. We have to think of a way to help Uncle Jin Yang and get Grandpa’s approval!”\nQiu Xingqiao nodded valiantly. He could also tell that Qiu Rong hated Jin Yang.\nEvery time Qiu Rong passed by the living room, he would turn around and take a walk in the garden courtyard whenever he saw Jin Yang. Qiu Xingyuan frowned and asked, “Do you have any good ideas?”\nQiu Xingyu chewed on her finger and muttered, “Every time I act spoiled with Grandpa, he’ll be very happy.”\nQiu Xingyuan, Qiu Xingqiao and Ye Luan: “…”\nThe children discussed for the entire morning but could not come up with a definite plan. They could only postpone this matter for the time being.\nIn the courtyard of the villa, two loaded trucks were parked by the roadside.\nThe president’s guards quickly moved dozens of heavy metal boxes onto the courtyard. Qiu Tong walked out in an apron and stood beside Jin Yang. “What are these?”\nJin Yang curled his thin lips smugly and whispered in her ear, “It’s high-precision laboratory test equipment.”\n“They’re all from the first-rate laboratories in the military. I had Shao An bring back an entire set.”\n“This way, it will be very convenient for Uncle Qiu and Qiu Xingyuan. I hope this can earn me some brownie points.”\nJin Yang hugged her shoulders and gently kissed her cheek.\nQiu Tong didn’t expect him to be so considerate. She was so touched that she beamed happily as she leaned her head on his shoulder.",

      "content": "Chapter 277: Modification Drug\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nThe top-floor conference room of the villa had been modified into a chemistry laboratory specially for Qiu Rong.\nCountless sophisticated instruments were sitting in the spacious room. This was undoubtedly the greatest temptation for a scientist. Even if Qiu Rong pretended not to be interested, he still couldn’t control his excitement as he walked into the laboratory.\nAt first, he just looked at the equipment. Slowly, his hands began to itch and he started fiddling with them. He even forgot about the time and stayed there for an entire afternoon, trying out all the equipment.\nQiu Tong and Jin Yang hid in the shadows and watched his delighted expression. Qiu Tong whispered, “It looks like your plan is effective.”\nJin Yang raised his eyebrows slightly, the heaviness in his heart lifting slightly.\nQiu Xingyuan walked silently to the laboratory and stood obediently beside Qiu Rong. He quietly observed his movements and memorized them. Qiu Xingyuan was an extremely talented young genius, but his knowledge and practical experience were still far inferior to Qiu Rong’s.\nQiu Rong shook a test tube and handed the purple liquid to Qiu Xingyuan.\nHe asked tentatively, “Can you tell its components?”\nQiu Xingyuan gently sniffed the liquid. He then wrote down precise chemical composition on a piece of paper.\nQiu Rong nodded in delight. He couldn’t help praising him. “Good! You’re indeed my good grandson!”\n…\nIn the dining room, everyone was sitting around the dining table.\nAlthough Qiu Rong’s expression remained stern, everyone could feel that his attitude towards Jin Yang had softened.\nQiu Xingyu was especially excited as she raised her drink to clink glasses with them. Qiu Tong saw that Qiu Xingyu’s sleeve was dipping into the vegetable soup and she hurriedly helped her roll up her cuffs. She then glanced at Jin Yang, gesturing for him to speak.\nJin Yang took the initiative to stand up and pour some wine for Qiu Rong. He said respectfully, “Uncle Qiu, if there’s anything you need or if there’s anything you are uncomfortable with, feel free to tell me.”\nQiu Rong frowned and clinked glasses with him without saying a word. A conflicted look flashed across his eyes.\nIn the evening, Qiu Tong saw that Qiu Rong was still in the laboratory.\nShe walked over to Qiu Rong and placed her hand on his shoulder. “Dad, you are still recovering. Don’t be too anxious.” She saw a familiar chemical formula written in a notebook.\nSensing her gaze, Qiu Rong told her, “This is the human modification drug.”\nQiu Tong frowned and examined the chemical formula. She wanted to voice her doubts.\nQiu Rong beat her to it. “This isn’t the complete version. Back then, the government gathered all the experts and scholars in various fields to develop a drug that can change the structure of a human’s body and strengthen the various bodily functions by a hundred times.”\n“Ye Luan’s father and I were both in the project.”\nQiu Rong’s expression grew heavy as he recalled his memories.\n“In the beginning, we had high expectations and were very enthusiastic. We felt that developing this drug would become the biggest breakthrough in our field, or even in the entire world’s history! But things are much more complicated than we imagined…”\n“The human body has already evolved to a stage where all the cells and functions are in a balanced state.”\n“If we use drugs to break the balance, it will definitely cause serious side effects.”\n“The chemical formula you saw in that notebook is only half of the complete formula. Ye Luan’s father accidentally discovered it, but we destroyed all the drugs we made. We also destroyed half of the records.”\nQiu Rong sighed deeply. He knew that Ye Luan’s father’s death was also related to it.\nQiu Tong frowned. She knew a little about biology and chemistry, and she couldn’t see any harm in this formula.\nQiu Rong stood up after a moment of silence and walked to the operating table to mix his chemicals.\nHe took out two mice from a cage and injected the drug into their bodies. About five minutes later, the two mice were clearly restless, anxious, and even tried to smash themselves against the cage.\nQiu Tong stared at him with widened eyes. Qiu Rong injected the antidote into their bodies and the white mice fell asleep, their limbs twitching occasionally. They were clearly weaker than before.\nQiu Rong poured the drug away. “The modification drug can amplify a certain function. In short, it can allow a person’s running speed or resistance to attacks to become three or even five times that of the original. But after the medicinal effects dissipate, the person will show signs of weakening and irreversible damage.”\n“In serious cases, death will occur.”\nQiu Rong smiled in self-mockery. He took off his protective goggles and said dejectedly, “I never expected that this drug would end up being a poison that will cause death! Tongtong, do you think I’m a bad person?”\nQiu Tong sensed his gloom and took the initiative to hug him. “No!”\n“I believe you can find a solution.”\nQiu Tong looked at him confidently. Qiu Rong looked at her with a complicated expression. “Tongtong, do you want me to help Jin Yang?”\nAs the president, Jin Yang could use the drug to strengthen the army and stabilize his current position.",

Even if he has the drug, he won’t abuse it to hurt anyone and stabilize his so-called position of power.”\n“I will also respect your choice. If you want to continue developing the drug, we will support you all the way. But if you want to give up, I will still feel proud of you. Because you made your choice for the sake of everyone and not for your own benefit.”\nQiu Tong answered Qiu Rong’s question firmly. Her honesty and warmth made Qiu Rong feel unprecedentedly secure.\nQiu Rong hugged her tightly. Both their eyes had reddened with emotion. They didn’t say anything else.\nIn the stairway near the laboratory, a few tiny heads were crowded together.\nThe children were trying to eavesdrop when they saw Qiu Rong and Qiu Tong walking out side by side. Their expressions were solemn and the atmosphere was awkward and stiff.\nQiu Xingqiao was so impatient that he lost his balance and fell. He covered his mouth and ignored the dull pain coming from his butt.\nQiu Xingyu narrowed her eyes worriedly. She tugged at the corner of Ye Luan’s shirt, already imagining the worst-case scenario.\n“Did Grandpa fight with Mommy? Does he want Mommy to bring us out of here? What about Uncle Jin Yang?”\nAs Qiu Xingyuan listened to her whining, his cold and handsome face was filled with dark clouds. He quietly clenched his fists and tried to think of a solution.\nYe Luan was a little older, so he came up with a brilliant suggestion. “We can let Uncle Jin Yang do something to please Grandpa Qiu!”\nThe other children looked at Ye Luan. Half an hour later, Qiu Xingyu ran to the study and pulled Jin Yang out by the wrist.\nJin Yang followed her to the garden in surprise. When he saw the three children standing there solemnly, he instantly became a little nervous.\nQiu Xingyu stood beside Qiu Xingyuan with her hands on her waist. The children looked like they were about to interrogate Jin Yang. Qiu Xingyuan asked, “Are you willing to give up everything for Mommy and do whatever it takes to make her happy? You don’t want to see her being caught between Grandpa and you, right?”\nJin Yang nodded, not understanding what the children were trying to say.\nCarrying a hoe, Qiu Xingqiao pointed at the plant nursery a distance away. He gestured for Jin Yang to come closer.\nJin Yang hesitated for two seconds before striding to their side and squatting down. The children crowded around him and whispered into his ear. Shao An saw this scene from afar. Thinking that they were having an intimate family moment, Shao An sighed enviously.\n“In just a few days, his relationship with the children has progressed so quickly…”\nThe children’s explanation was a little messy but Jin Yang managed to pick out the keywords and finally understood their intentions. He rubbed his aching ears in amusement.\nQiu Xingyu looked up at him worriedly. “Got it?”\nJin Yang rubbed the top of her head with his hands. Looking at her fluffy and perky hair, he couldn’t help smiling. “Don’t worry!”\n…\nThe next day at noon, Jin Yang brought Shao An to the nearby plant nursery and bought hundreds of fresh flower buds.\nShao An carried the flower pots and seedlings to the loading truck. He rubbed the sore muscles in his arms and grumbled, “Sir, are you going to change professions to become a flower farmer? Where do you plan to put these seedlings?”\nShao An felt that Jin Yang’s recent actions were becoming increasingly difficult to predict.\nJin Yang also raised his hand to wipe the sweat off his forehead. He looked at the message he received on his phone. “Let’s set off. The materials I ordered for planting have arrived. We need to move them into the garden now. Later, you’ll follow me and plant them in the backyard.”\nShao An was so shocked that his mouth fell open. He wondered if he was hallucinating.\nJin Yang slapped the back of his head harshly, causing stars to appear in Shao An’s eyes as he swayed unsteadily.\n“This is a brilliant solution the children came up with for me. Little Yu asked me to think of a way to please Qiu Rong. If you mess up and make my wife leave, I will punish you by sending you to the remote suburbs on patrol duty!”\nAs Jin Yang explained, Shao An finally understood the reason behind this all. He followed behind Jin Yang and couldn’t help grumbling softly, “You’ve really changed too much for Miss Qiu. If news of this were to spread, no way the high-ranking officials in the capital would believe you did all these.”\n“Mr. President, do you know how to be a farmer?”\n“Will these flower buds survive until they bloom?”\nShao An mustered up the courage to ask in a worried tone. Jin Yang stopped abruptly and turned to glare at him with narrowed eyes.\nOh no! Why did he blurt those words out?!\nJust as Shao An was thinking of a way to save the situation, Jin Yang frowned and whispered, “Help me find a tutorial on planting flowers.”\n“Qiu Xingqiao said that I have to plant it personally to show my sincerity. Only then can I move Qiu Rong’s heart…”\nShao An heaved a sigh of relief. As he looked at Jin Yang’s back, his eyes were filled with indescribable sympathy.\nEven the president would also lose all common sense after falling in love!",

Qiu Rong was busy adjusting the ratio of the chemicals in the laboratory.\nKnock, knock. Qiu Xingyu’s little head popped out. She ran to Qiu Rong’s side with a mysterious expression and held his hand as they walked out. Qiu Rong hurriedly put down the chemicals in his hand and followed her to the balcony on the top floor.\nQiu Xingyu pointed at the figure in the garden and said in a sweet voice, “Grandpa, look!”\n“Uncle Jin Yang is preparing a surprise gift for you. He’s really taking good care of us…”\nQiu Rong followed her finger and saw that the garden had suddenly turned into a different sight.\nLong lines were dug into the soil. With some difficulty, Jin Yang and Shao An carried the various flower buds and planted them. Their clumsy actions but serious attitude made Qiu Rong frown. The emotions in his eyes swirled. In the end, he sighed and took off his protective suit. “They’re ruining those plants. Little Yu, come with Grandpa to take a look!”\nQiu Xingyu watched Qiu Rong’s expression change and stuck out her tongue happily.\nIn the garden, Shao An’s face was filled with dirt streaks as he dug the holes. From time to time, Jin Yang would stop and flip through the plantation manual given by the seller. He instructed Shao An to throw two seedlings into the pit. Just as he was about to cover them with soil, a voice stopped him from behind.\nQiu Rong appeared beside him in a straw hat and snatched the hoe in disdain.\n“This is a peach blossom tree plant and it needs a deeper pit. Otherwise, it will collapse in the wind. All of you, stand at the side to watch…”\nQiu Rong waved the hoe. Jin Yang and Shao An looked at each other before observing Qiu Rong with humble and respectful expressions.\nQiu Xingyu squatted on the ground and used her hand to fiddle with the flower buds as she asked all sorts of questions.\nQiu Rong answered her questions patiently. From the corner of his eye, he realized that Jin Yang was also working by copying his actions. His furrowed brows finally relaxed a little.\nThe sun was scorching. Qiu Xingyu couldn’t bear it anymore, her face was covered in sweat. Qiu Rong had Shao An bring her back to the house to cool down.\nWhen only the two of them were left in the garden, Qiu Rong raised his hand to wipe the sweat off his forehead. He hesitated for a moment before saying, “It wasn’t easy for Tongtong. She brought up those children by herself. I didn’t fulfill my responsibility as a father. I feel guilty towards her.”\n“I can tell that you’re very attentive to her, but Tongtong doesn’t need a short-term love affair.”\n“She needs a responsible man to take care of her. No matter what happens, he cannot abandon her, even if he has to go against his principles…”\nQiu Rong propped the hoe on the ground and stared straight at him. “Can you do it?”\nIn the garden, Jin Yang stood tall. He paused to think for a moment before nodding. “Uncle Qiu, Qiu Tong will always be my first choice. I won’t let her and the children suffer!”\nQiu Rong was very satisfied with his answer. He waved his hand and pointed at the flower buds nearby. “What are you waiting for? Hand them to me!”\nSensing the change in his attitude, Jin Yang hurriedly helped out.\nOn the balcony, a few tiny heads were gathered together. Qiu Xingqiao leaned against the railing and looked at Qiu Rong and Jin Yang. He tilted his head with uncertainty and asked, “Brother, does it look like Grandpa has accepted him?”\nQiu Xingyuan released his clenched fists and nodded with pursed lips.\nIn the evening, Jin Yang followed behind Qiu Rong, covered in mud. He looked up and saw the children. He made a victory sign at them. Qiu Xingyu waved her arms sweetly. Qiu Xingqiao and Ye Luan high-fived each other in celebration.\nWhen Qiu Rong heard the commotion and looked over, the children quickly stopped their actions and pretended to be occupied.\nJin Yang and the children’s tacit cooperation made Qiu Rong feel rather exasperated. Nevertheless, a gratified smile flashed across his eyes.\nFrom the moment Qiu Xingyu appeared, Qiu Rong had guessed the children’s motives. He was just testing Jin Yang. Over the past few days, no matter how coldly he treated him, Jin Yang did not show any disrespect or annoyance. As a result, Qiu Rong slowly started to accept him.\nAs long as Qiu Tong was happy, Qiu Rong felt that everything was worth it.\nIn the living room of the villa, Qiu Tong saw that their faces were red from the sun. She hurriedly poured two glasses of ice water for them. She wanted to find out what had happened between Jin Yang and Qiu Rong. However, the two of them smiled knowingly and refused to divulge anything.\nJin Yang held her shoulder and took a deep breath.\nQiu Tong sensed Qiu Rong’s gaze and wanted to slap his hand away. However, Jin Yang tightened his grip instead.\nQiu Rong’s gaze swept past them indifferently as he walked straight to the kitchen. Qiu Tong’s eyes widened in surprise as she pinched Jin Yang’s face and asked, “How did you do that?” If it were in the past, Qiu Rong would have coughed loudly to remind them to be more discreet!\nJin Yang smiled and looked tenderly at the children running down the stairs. “I have reliable support!”",

Jin Tao’s deployments in S City had all failed. Qiu Tong and Jin Yang were very vigilant. He held a glass and gently rubbed the rim with his finger, sensing that things had become a little tricky.\nJin Tao’s assistant lowered his head and stood in front of him. He said in a pained tone, “Sir, the spy in the prison just committed suicide.”\n“It’s said that he killed himself in Jin Yang’s basement while the guards were changing shifts. He didn’t say anything about us.”\nJin Tao nodded indifferently. There was no pity in his tone as he instructed, “Send some money to his family.”\nThe assistant opened his mouth a few times but swallowed his words in the end.\nJin Tao could tell that there was something on his assistant’s mind. He placed the glass on the table and stood up to pat his shoulder.\n“We have to look at the big picture. From the day he went to the prison to be a spy, he knew that his final fate was likely to be death. If you go soft, you will lose! You will be stepped on by your opponent!”\n“Qiu Tong and Jin Yang’s relationship is progressing quickly. They’re cooperating well and will definitely be an obstacle to us in the near future.”\n“Send more men to S City and get rid of Qiu Tong as soon as possible. Remember to hide your identity and not let Jin Yang find out anything! You can’t use our weapons or gear. Clear out anything that can point to your true identity before carrying out the mission!”\nJin Tao’s voice was cold as he instructed. The assistant adjusted his emotions and nodded, turning around to carry out his orders.\nMeanwhile, Song Yan overheard their conversation and his pupils dilated.\nSong Yan returned to the capital last night and he planned to stay a couple of nights before greeting Jin Tao. He didn’t expect to hear such a shocking plan.\nCondensation from the cold beer in his hand dripped onto the living room floor…\nJin Tao suddenly looked over, his eyes filled with scrutiny and faint coldness.\nSong Yan’s mind raced. He rubbed his hair and yawned. He waved at him lazily. “Dad.”\n“Good evening. Long time no see.”\nSong Yan walked casually towards the living room. He threw himself onto the sofa and gulped down his beer, reeking of alcohol.\nJin Tao narrowed his eyes and asked impatiently, “When did you return?”\nSong Yan held up two fingers as his lips curled into a self-mocking smile. “You didn’t notice, right?”\n“I’m already used to it. Since when did I exist in your eyes? I have to hide myself in case your blood pressure shoots up at the sight of me. I was just sneaking a drink and didn’t expect to be caught by you. Don’t worry, I promise I will be very quiet in the future.”\nJin Tao heard the sarcasm in his words, but he just asked about Jin Yang instead.\nSong Yan gritted his teeth and sneered. He ruffled his hair and stood up abruptly. “Jin Yang, Jin Yang! You only think about him! I’m your son as well. When have you ever looked me in the eye?!”\n“Oh, I almost forgot. Only the president can be your son, so I’m not worthy…”\nSong Yan raised his hand and slapped his left cheek. He walked to Jin Tao and growled in disappointment and anger, “You chose Jin Yang over me since we were young, choosing the one most suitable for nurturing and management. So of course I was abandoned by you.”\n“All these years, I’ve been neglected. Do you know what the high-ranking officials secretly say about me?”\n“Mr. Jin Tao, I can ignore everything, but what exactly am I to you?”\nWhen Song Yan saw that he was still silent, the frustration in his heart surged. He took two steps back and laughed wildly. “But what about now? Where is Jin Yang? He has gone beyond your control too! Isn’t that so?”\nSmack!!\nJin Tao slapped Song Yan harshly. Song Yan held his stinging right cheek and looked at his so-called father in disbelief.\nJin Tao pointed at the door and scolded, “Get lost!”\nSong Yan pressed his tongue against his teeth and wiped the blood from his thin lips. He grabbed his jacket from the back of the sofa and walked out.\nIn the cold night, he walked for a long distance before stopping. Song Yan looked back at the brightly lit villa and called his trusted aide. “Help me book a plane ticket to S City. The sooner, the better!”\n…\nAt the villa, a steady breathing sound echoed in the room.\nQiu Tong suddenly opened her eyes. She pushed Jin Yang’s arm away and sat up, panting heavily.\nJin Yang switched on the night light with sleepy eyes. He saw Qiu Tong’s pale face covered in cold sweat and hugged her. “Why have you been having so many nightmares lately? I’ll get Shao An to bring a doctor to do a full body checkup for you. Do you want to take some calming medicine?”\nQiu Tong shook her head as she thought of the recurring nightmare that she had been having recently.\nShe held Jin Yang’s hand tightly and thought of the extremely realistic explosion in her dream. She couldn’t help pressing her head against his chest in panic.\nJin Yang sensed her fragility and coaxed her in a relaxed tone, “Dreams are the opposite of reality. Don’t be afraid!”",

She raised her index finger to her lips to signal for silence.\nQiu Xingyu cleverly ran to the computer. She wanted to use the GPS system to track the other party’s exact location.\nQiu Tong picked up the call, and the background noise of the casino came from the other end.\nBo Lang swirled his cup and took two deep breaths from the cigar in his hand. “Sally, go to the crossroad in the suburbs at 9:58 PM tomorrow. A van will bring you to see me. Don’t be late.”\n“The upper echelons of the organization would like to meet you and confirm your identity before revising your mission. Any problems?”\nQiu Tong frowned but responded in a relaxed tone, “Of course not, thank you.”\nAfter hanging up, Qiu Xingyu pointed at the location of the Sent Bar on the map.\nQiu Tong picked her up with a smile and kissed her sweet face. She then turned to look at Jin Yang. “It looks like we can find out the other party’s core information this time!”\nAs long as she could gain the trust of the upper echelons of the Vulture Organization, she would be able to monitor their movements in S City and find out about their boss.\nJin Yang felt uneasy. He offered his gun to Qiu Tong but she shook her head.\nQiu Xingyu placed Qiu Xingyu on the ground and motioned for her to go play with Ye Luan outside.\n“Bo Lang is very vigilant. I will definitely have to undergo a body-search before I can meet the upper echelons of the organization. I will bring a couple of daggers and an ordinary handgun as part of my cover, but I will let them find them…”\n“Shao An’s intelligence said that Bo Lang hasn’t sent anyone to keep an eye on the black market recently. Their suspicions about me should have been dispelled.”\n“I’ll try my best to contact you before midnight. If you don’t receive my call by then, Little Yu will help you find my location.”\nQiu Tong looked at the little girl running around with a kite in her hand and opened her palm to show Jin Yang the tape that had almost merged with her skin.\nHer eyes were filled with pride as she explained, “Qiu Xingyuan and Little Yu worked together to develop a new tracking locator chip. This tape covering the chip ensures that it will not be detected by electromagnetic devices. Meanwhile, the chip can help you find my location and monitor my vital signs.”\nJin Yang looked at the tape in surprise. Qiu Tong looked at his expression and smiled.\nQiu Xingyuan would indeed become a top scientist and Little Yu a formidable hacker in the future!\n…\nThe next day, Qiu Tong waited at the crossroad in the suburbs as promised.\nShe looked around and observed her surroundings. She realized that there were no buildings around that would block the view. It seemed like Bo Lang was still cautious.\nA horn beeped. Qiu Tong saw a dilapidated van appear at the end of the road and raised her hand to greet them.\nThe van door was pushed open from the inside, and some burly men jumped out with masks on. They took out a black blindfold and tied it around her, then had her sit in the backseat. As she listened to the commotion, she determined that there were at least five or six people around.\nThe car continued to drive. Qiu Tong closed her eyes to visualize their journey, but she realized that they were just circling around.\nQiu Tong had a bad premonition. She gave a light laugh and asked the person beside her, “Where’s Bo Lang? Where are we going?”\n“I’m feeling a little dizzy. Can you remove my blindfold so that I can take a breather?”\nThe car was quiet. No one answered. Qiu Tong was about to touch the door when a hoarse voice berated from the side, “Don’t move! Behave yourself if you don’t want to die. Mr. Bo Lang is already waiting for you at the abandoned factory!”\n“You want some air? There’s a lot of time for you to enjoy it later!”\nBo Lang was waiting for her? Not the upper echelons of the Vulture Organization?!\nQiu Tong sensed danger and instinctively swung her elbow at the man beside her.\nShe moved to take off her blindfold and escape when… thump!!\nThe dull thud of a metal rod hitting her neck echoed in the car. Qiu Tong felt dizzy and fell unconscious.\nThe van drove towards the abandoned factory. Bo Lang sat beside a paint bucket. He stood up with an intrigued expression.\nDozens of bare-chested burly men were gathered in the spacious venue. Their arms, backs or waists were all marked with the Vulture Organization tattoo. Bo Lang lit the firewood and threw a red-hot branding iron on the ground. He nodded and gestured for them to go over.\nThe members dragged Qiu Tong out of the car and tied her to a wooden seat.\nBo Lang got the burly man beside him to splash a bucket of cold water on Qiu Tong to wake her up…\nQiu Tong opened her eyes and gasped. Her curly hair was wet and stuck to her face. She saw Bo Lang squatting in front of her. “What are you doing? Didn’t you say you were going to bring me to meet the upper echelons? Let go of me!” She wanted to kick Bo Lang, but her ankles were tied up and she couldn’t move.\nBo Lang’s eyes were filled with sympathy as he hooked her chin. “Upper echelons?”\n“Are we going to continue pretending now?” Bo Lang clapped his hands and stared at her. “Should I call you Sally or Qiu Tong?”",

He tore open Qiu Tong’s collar and took out the ring hanging from her neck on a chain. “From the first time we met, I knew you weren’t part of us…”\nQiu Tong frowned slightly as she suppressed the fear in her heart.\nBo Lang took out the ring and wore it on his thumb. He opened his left hand and looked at the other similar ring.\n“You’re very smart. There’s no way to verify the lies you’ve fabricated. Your story had no loopholes and faced with such a femme fatale, the members will be inclined to believe you and welcome you back to Vulture.”\nBo Lang paused and pretended to be sympathetic as he pinched her chin. “But you’re unlucky.”\n“The Sent Bar is my territory, and I happen to be a high-level member of the Vulture Organization. This ring is only gifted to members who have made great contributions to the organization. There are less than ten of them around, and I’m familiar with all of them.”\n“Also, Vulture has never accepted a female member. This is your fatal flaw!”\nQiu Tong listened to his explanation and recalled how much the prison guard had cared about the ring. He had also bragged that he was a top killer and was placed in an important position…\nIt turned out that what he said was true. Qiu Tong had dismissed his claims and this was why she had ended up in this situation now.\nQiu Tong looked at Bo Lang resolutely. “What do you want to do with me?”\nBo Lang clicked his tongue and shook his head. He wasn’t in a hurry to hurt her. Instead, he was enjoying the game. He wanted to slowly torture her, her body and mind, until she was at the brink of collapse and beg for death.\nThe bonfire in the abandoned factory was burning brightly. The burning flames were very glaring, preventing Qiu Tong from seeing her surroundings clearly.\nAs Bo Lang drank with the members, he glanced sideways at her and stuffed a piece of smelly raw meat into her mouth.\n“You must have some safety protocol with the president, right? Something like you’ll contact him before midnight…”\nQiu Tong frowned and watched helplessly as Bo Lang took the phone from her and dialed Jin Yang’s number before pressing the speaker button.\nJin Yang’s voice rang out from the other side. Qiu Tong wanted to warn him, but two burly men rushed over and covered her mouth tightly. She couldn’t make any sound at all.\nJin Yang asked anxiously, “How’s the situation? Where are you? I’ll pick you up now.”\nBo Lang pursed his lips in an exaggerated manner and shook his head gently as he said into the phone, “Mr. President, I’m sorry. I am not Qiu Tong.”\nWhen Jin Yang heard the unfamiliar male voice, his body instantly stiffened as he gripped his gun.\nHe realized that Qiu Tong’s identity had been exposed. He motioned for Shao An to contact the guards.\nBo Lang looked at Qiu Tong’s wretched state coldly. “I’ll give you the address, Mr. President. You’d better hurry over with Qiu Rong and the modification drug. I don’t want to hurt your woman.”\n“As long as I can get what I want, I promise you that she will remain unharmed.”\n“But if you play any tricks, I’m sorry, you’ll only see Qiu Tong’s corpse… the kind that has been abused.”\nBeep! Bo Lang hung up the phone and sent the address to Jin Yang. He waved his hand to signal the members to leave.\nQiu Tong spat out the raw meat and cursed Bo Lang and his men. But they just laughed. Five minutes later, Qiu Tong finally regained her composure.\nShe looked at him rationally and asked, “How did you know about my relationship with Jin Yang?”\nBo Lang poked at the fire with a soldering iron and stared at her with his blue fake eye. The scars on his face were particularly eye-catching. “Do you think the Vulture Organization is like those small-time hooligans at the black market? We have members embedded in every official department in all the cities.”\n“As long as we want to find out, nothing can evade us!”\nAs if recalling something from the past, Bo Lang took the initiative to tell Qiu Tong, “I remember telling you that my eye was injured during a certain operation, and the person who blinded me was Jin Yang…”\n“I brought my men to corner him and his guards, but I didn’t expect this to happen!!”\nBo Lang’s eyes were filled with anger as he kicked the bonfire. He tugged at Qiu Tong’s hair as his lips curled into a cold smile.\n“I’ve always wanted to take revenge for my eye, but I couldn’t find a chance.”\n“I didn’t expect you to deliver it to me! It’s a lie that I’ll let you go after getting the drug.”\nBo Lang took out the submachine guns and rocket launchers in the corner and distributed them to the members. He stationed himself on a high ground of the abandoned factory and observed the movements around him. He said through gritted teeth, “When Jin Yang comes, I will make sure he can never leave. I want to dig out both of his eyes and let him experience the feeling of losing your sight…”\n“I’ll send you along with him to hell. Don’t worry.”\nBo Lang looked at her and arranged for some members to watch over her. He then communicated with his subordinates to confirm their plans and deployment arrangements.",

      "content": "Chapter 283: Rescue\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao ran to the entrance to stop Jin Yang and Shao An. The children could guess what happened from their expressions.\nQiu Xingqiao said with resolution, “Uncle Jin Yang, is Mommy in danger? We’ll go with you!”\nQiu Xingyu brought out her laptop and drone equipment from the room and looked at Jin Yang with a firm expression.\nYe Luan frowned nervously. “We will definitely listen to your instructions and not cause trouble for you.”\nJin Yang wanted to refuse, but Qiu Xingyuan interrupted him. “Even if you leave us behind, we will find a way to follow you.”\nQiu Xingyuan’s firm tone stunned Jin Yang. There was no time for them to waste.\nJin Yang frowned at Ke Le. “Protect them!\nThe group drove to the abandoned factory. Jin Yang and Shao An ordered the guards to station themselves in an open space 100 meters away from the factory.\nThe scouts went first to observe the situation and returned to report to Jin Yang. “There are no hidden traps around the factory. Over 10 armed personnel are patrolling the empty space. They are well-armed and there’s a possibility of them having explosives in the factory.”\n“They are too far away. There’s no way to confirm Miss Qiu’s exact location…”\nJin Yang had lost his rationality. He wanted to storm the factory with his guards and rescue Qiu Tong.\nShao An tried his best to stop him. “Sir! The Vulture Organization wants to use Qiu Tong to threaten you. If we give them the drug and Mr. Qiu, she’ll be safe. You can’t charge in rashly. You’ll fall into their trap!”\n“You stay here and command the troops. I’ll bring a team in and confirm Miss Qiu’s location for you!”\nWearing protective gear, Shao An assembled the team.\nQiu Xingyu walked to them with her laptop in her arms. She was so nervous that her hands were trembling, but she pointed at the coordinates displayed on the screen. Qiu Tong’s location and vital signs were displayed in front of them.\n“They didn’t discover the tracker on Mommy. Second Brother and I searched for information on the nearby factories and satellite databases. The topographic map drawn should be accurate. The abandoned factory in front was built in the last century…”\nQiu Xingqiao’s hoarse voice was heard from the left. He held his binoculars and said, “The factory is built with red brick walls.”\n“Mommy is in the southeastern corner. If we bomb the beam supporting the second floor, a small portion of the roof will collapse.”\n“That degree of damage won’t hurt Mommy. Snipers, lie in ambush and cover us with gunfire. We have 30 seconds to save Mommy!”\nShao An was so shocked that he couldn’t close his mouth. He looked at Qiu Xingqiao with surging emotions. He didn’t expect Qiu Xingqiao to have such talent in military tactics!\nJin Yang quickly analyzed their plan and nodded at Shao An. “Do as they say.”\nQiu Xingyu curled up in the corner and secretly wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes with the back of her hand.\nQiu Xingyuan walked to her side and held her hand tightly.\nQiu Xingyu looked at him helplessly. “Brother, Mommy will definitely be fine, right?”\nQiu Xingyuan nodded heavily. Although he was also very anxious, he still comforted his younger sibling. At this moment, Qiu Rong and Ye Luan were sitting in a bulletproof van. Apart from waiting, they couldn’t do anything else. Time passed bit by bit. Qiu Rong wanted to go out.\nBut Ye Luan stopped him. “Grandpa Qiu, you can’t show yourself. Otherwise, it will affect Uncle Jin Yang’s plans.”\nQiu Rong looked down in frustration. He had never regretted participating in this drug research so much.\nHe covered his head and whispered, “I’m sorry!”\nAfter the president’s guards were deployed, Jin Yang diverted Bo Lang’s attention by calling Qiu Tong’s phone.\nBo Lang immediately picked up the call. Jin Yang raised his hand and was about to order his men to fire when the sound of fierce gunfire came from behind the factory.\nJin Yang looked at Shao An in surprise. “Our people?”\nShao An shook his head. Bo Lang said fiercely, “Jin Yang! You’re playing dirty with me!”\nClick! The phone call was cut off. Jin Yang couldn’t care about anything else as he ordered the guards to bomb the second floor beam.\nThe battle instantly turned chaotic. Qiu Tong trembled as debris fell all around her. She saw a heavily injured Vulture member lying on the ground beside her. Using all her strength, she crashed herself and her chair into a cement pillar nearby. The violent impact shattered the wooden chair into pieces.\nQiu Tong surveyed her wounds and stood up unsteadily, before quickly untying the rope around her wrists and ankles.\nBo Lang continued to shoot from the top floor. The attacks from the front and back had him in a bind. The Vulture members watched as some masked criminals charged in. They panted as they said to Bo Lang, “Boss, they don’t seem to be in cahoots with Jin Yang!”\nThe masked criminals’ firepower was extremely formidable. Bo Lang saw the stairs of the building explode and shouted, “Trash! Keep an eye on Qiu Tong!”\n“We can’t let her escape!”\nBo Lang knew that she was his only bargaining chip.\nThe Vulture members immediately ran downstairs to block her escape.",

She wanted to take advantage of the chaos to move to the periphery to meet up with Jin Yang.\nWhen the Vulture members discovered her, they surrounded her from all directions.\nQiu Tong picked up two submachine guns from the ground and took cover as she fired. She tried to contact Qiu Xingyu through the tracker, but the chaos in front of her made it impossible for her to find the right opportunity.\nThe president’s guards were in a deadlock with the Vulture Organization at the periphery. The masked criminals sneaked into the factory.\nThe moment they saw Qiu Tong, they issued a fierce barrage of gunfire.\nOne of the bullets pierced Qiu Tong’s arm. She threw her submachine gun away in pain and took cover.\nWho were they?!\nThe Vulture Organization wouldn’t kill her, but the masked criminals clearly wanted her life.\nOutside the factory, Jin Yang brought the guards closer to the southeast corner. He called out Qiu Tong’s name in a hoarse voice, but there was no response. When the masked criminals saw him, they frowned before quickly surrounding Qiu Tong.\nThey aimed their guns at Qiu Tong. A red dot light appeared on her forehead.\nBang! The masked criminal pulled the trigger, and a bullet shot out from the barrel.\nQiu Tong couldn’t dodge in time and looked at the bullet coming at her. A black shadow suddenly appeared in front of her and threw her to the ground.\n“Song Yan?! Why are you here?”\nQiu Tong looked at the face before her. Still in shock, she covered his bleeding abdomen with her hands.\nSong Yan spat out some blood. His eyes darkened as he said, “Jin Yang is simply trash. He still hasn’t come to save you.”\n“Do you want to consider being with me? I saved your life!”\nSong Yan smiled and the sight of his teeth covered in blood shocked Qiu Tong. She tore off a piece of cloth and bandaged his wounds before dragging him to a safe spot. Jin Yang and his guards slowly gained the upper hand as the masked criminals and Vulture members began to retreat.\nKe Le led the mercenaries into the factory to conduct a search. He saw Qiu Tong was covered in blood and shouted anxiously, “Boss!”\n“Where are you injured? There’s a doctor outside. I’ll bring you out now!”\nKe Le bent over to carry Qiu Tong but she just held her injured arm and pushed him away. “Carry him out of here.”\n“This blood is all his. If we delay any longer, he might lose too much blood and go into shock.”\nKe Le was surprised and confused at the sight of Song Yan.\nThe mercenaries supported her as they walked out of the factory. Jin Yang ran over quickly and the two of them hugged tightly amongst the ruins. Qiu Tong looked at the bloodstains on his face and placed her hand over it, using her special ability to heal his wounds. “Bo Lang escaped. He’s a high-ranking member of the Vulture Organization.”\n“I’m afraid it will be difficult for us to investigate further.”\nJin Yang felt his heartbeat stabilize. He held her face in his hands and leaned down to kiss her, ignoring the situation.\nAs their lips touched, Qiu Tong could feel his uneasiness. She wrapped her arms around his neck and responded to him.\n“Ahem.”\nLying on the stretcher, Song Yan opened his eyes and saw this intimate scene. He rolled his eyes and laid back down.\nShao An led the guards to clean up the battlefield and gather the corpses. Jin Yang sent people to carefully search for any information they might have left behind. Qiu Xingyu looked at them with tears in her eyes. The children surrounded Qiu Tong and Qiu Xingyuan sensibly disinfected her wounds.\nYe Luan wrapped gauze around her and said hesitantly, “Auntie Qiu.”\nQiu Tong hugged him and patted her head gently. “Don’t be afraid, I’m fine!”\nYe Luan felt her warmth and couldn’t help crying.\nWhen he and Qiu Rong were hiding in the bulletproof car, his mind was filled with scenes of his father’s death. The gun battle. His father had hidden him in a safe corner. “Good child, come out only when there’s no sound outside! Don’t turn around. Run forward. Protect yourself, okay?”\nThe shadow in Ye Luan’s heart was triggered at this moment. He trembled as he tugged at the corner of Qiu Tong’s clothes and gritted his teeth.\nQiu Tong patted his back and whispered, “Your father loves you very much. He must be watching you from above.”\nQiu Xingyu wiped her tears in empathy. Song Yan sat up weakly and looked at his bandage, which was already soaked through with blood. He said in a daze, “Hey, do you guys have any conscience? Without me, your Mommy would have died.”\n“Cough cough…”\nSong Yan shivered. His entire body felt cold as if he had fallen into an ice pit. He curled up his body and grimaced in pain.\nQiu Xingyu ran to his side with the first aid kit. She held Song Yan’s bloodstained hand.\n“Uncle Song Yan, thank you!”\nQiu Xingyu blinked her sparkling eyes, which were filled with fear. However, she still carefully removed the bandage. “Uncle, bear with the pain. You’ll get better soon!”\nListening to her voice, Song Yan’s eyes gradually closed before he fainted.",

      "content": "Chapter 285: Provocation\nTranslator:\nAtlas Studios\nEditor:\nAtlas Studios\nThe news reported on the vicious gun battle in the suburbs.\nJin Yang had instructed the relevant departments to attribute the incident to a gang fight over territory.\nBack at the villa, Qiu Tong looked at Song Yan lying on the bed. She treated the wound on his abdomen.\nThe Vulture members had used a shotgun which caused serious damage to Song Yan’s abdomen area.\nA flirtatious and wicked expression crossed Song Yan’s pale and haggard face. He narrowed his eyes and quietly watched as Qiu Tong sutured his wounds without anesthesia. Occasionally, he would grunt in pain.\nHe clenched the bed sheets tightly and endured with all his might.\nQiu Tong stared at him and casually probed. “Why were you at the abandoned factory?”\nThe timing of Song Yan’s appearance was too strange. Qiu Tong suspected that he was linked to the masked criminals.\nQiu Tong’s blunt question made Song Yan press against his heart sadly. “I’m your savior, but you still suspect me?”\n“I took a plane from the capital to S City at dawn. I saw suspicious cars at the toll station on the airport’s highway. Since I was bored, I followed them. I wanted to watch a good gunfight, but I didn’t expect their target to be you.”\n“Who knows why I was kind enough to take the bullet for you back then? I’m probably crazy.”\nSong Yan wiped away his cold sweat. His body trembled violently, but he still said flirtatiously, “If I really wanted to harm you, would I need to let myself get hurt to do it?”\nQiu Tong frowned slightly, but her actions became gentler than before.\nIn the living room, Jin Yang listened to Shao An and the guards’ report. There were dozens of dead bodies at the scene of the abandoned factory, most of whom had died from the explosion or gunshot wounds. When Shao An examined the corpses at the scene, he confirmed that all Vulture members had the tattoo on their bodies.\nJin Yang flipped through the photos at the scene and took out a rather special one, scanning it repeatedly.\nShao An explained the photo. “This is a photo of a dead body who should be a member of the masked criminal gang. We found him among the ruins. We speculate that the roof beam structure crashed down on him and killed him.”\nJin Yang re-examined the information. Sensing something strange, he looked up at the guards. “Only this one corpse?”\nAlthough the situation at that time was complicated, Jin Yang was very sure that the masked criminal gang had suffered heavy casualties. There shouldn’t only be one corpse!\nThe captain of the guards nodded. “Sir, there are signs of a clean-up at the scene. They must have taken their dead comrades away.”\n“The place where this corpse was buried was hidden. They didn’t have much time to fully scout the area, so they didn’t find it.”\nJin Yang and Shao An were both silent. Why were they so cautious?\nCould it be that the dead bodies would reveal clues about them?!\nJin Yang motioned for Shao An to bring the corpse back for further examination.\nThe villa was filled with a sense of oppression after the ordeal. The children fell into a deep sleep due to exhaustion. Jin Yang wanted to check on Song Yan’s condition. He pushed the door open and saw that Song Yan was naked and acting very flirtatiously.\nQiu Tong was sewing up his wounds with her head lowered. Her hand movements were extremely stable, and she did not stop Song Yan’s actions.\nJin Yang deliberately made a sound as he opened the door. Song Yan looked up at him and leaned against the bed frame. He said in a provocative tone, “You brought dozens of heavily-armed guards. You were truly cautious when dealing with your enemy.”\n“If I hadn’t appeared, you would probably be holding Qiu Tong in your arms and crying about your uselessness right now, right?”\nJin Yang’s expression changed as Song Yan mocked him. He clenched his fists and stared at him.\nQiu Tong tightened her grip on the needle and thread, causing Song Yan to gasp in pain.\nSong Yan was in so much pain that his thin lips went pale as he growled, “Hey! I’m telling the truth!”\nQiu Tong stood up to pack up the first aid kit. She gently brushed back the loose strands of hair at her temples and glanced at Song Yan indifferently. “You’ve lost too much blood. You need to recuperate quietly. It’s best if you don’t talk so much! Otherwise, you’ll probably have to lie in bed for a long period of time.”\n“I’ll come by regularly to change your dressing. Have a good rest.”\nWith that, she held Jin Yang’s elbow and pulled him out of the room. She closed the door behind her.\nJin Yang’s expression was extremely ugly. Qiu Tong looked up at him and said gently, “Your identity requires you to consider many things. You can’t sacrifice the members of your team rashly just because of me. They are also people. I understand your dilemma.”\nQiu Tong smiled and looked at the closed door.\n“But Song Yan did save my life at the critical moment.”\n“Bear with him for a while. No matter what he says, it won’t affect our relationship, right?”\nQiu Tong coquettishly buried her head into Jin Yang’s chest. Jin Yang raised his hand and placed it on her shoulder. He took a deep breath and nodded reluctantly.\nHowever, Song Yan’s words were like a thorn that had taken root in Jin Yang’s heart, just waiting for the right time to germinate and grow!\nThe burden and responsibility brought by Jin Yang’s status made him feel stifled and unable to breathe. He could only hug Qiu Tong tightly and try his best to forget the images that flashed in his mind…",

      "content": "Chapter 286: Confrontation Of The Brothers\nThe next morning, the television in the living room was turned up so loud that no one could continue sleeping.\nSong Yan’s recovery had progressed extremely well. In the corridor, he sat in a wheelchair full of vigor as he played noisy songs over a loudspeaker. He came to a stop in front of Jin Yang and Qiu Tong’s bedroom.\nIt was only when Qiu Tong walked out rubbing her sleepy eyes that Song Yan smiled wickedly. “I’m hungry.”\nQiu Tong stared at him helplessly as she slammed the door behind her and went to the kitchen to prepare breakfast.\nSong Yan sat smugly in the living room. He was feeling bored as he switched between television channels and glanced at Qiu Tong from time to time.\nQiu Rong returned from his morning jog and saw Song Yan slumped on the sofa. He stared at him with a scrutinizing expression.\nSong Yan blinked and hurriedly stood up with his walking stick. He smiled ingratiatingly. “You’re Uncle Qiu, right? I’m Qiu Tong’s good friend. I’ve often heard her mention you in the past. I didn’t expect you to be so young!”\nQiu Rong looked at his facial features that were identical to Jin Yang’s. He asked with a frown, “Your relationship with Jin Yang is…?”\nSong Yan’s eyes darkened for a moment before he smiled and answered, “He’s my brother. We are twins, but our personalities are different!”\n“You might not know, but I have a good relationship with the children. They’re actually my…”\nJust as Song Yan was about to tell him about the paternity test, Qiu Tong walked up to him and purposely knocked against his wound when handing him the breakfast tray.\nSong Yan instantly broke out in cold sweat. He was in so much pain that he had to crouch over. He whispered in Qiu Tong’s ear, “You’re too ruthless!”\nQiu Tong gritted her teeth and threatened, “You’d better not spout nonsense, or I’ll make sure your wound never heals!”\nSong Yan silently chewed on the burnt toast. He met Qiu Rong’s puzzled eyes and explained, “Qiu Xingyuan and the rest happen to be the kind of children I like. I get along very well with them.”\nQiu Rong felt that there seemed to be a special relationship between him and Qiu Tong. He wanted to probe further.\nThe children ran out of the bedroom and surrounded Qiu Rong to distract him.\nJin Yang stared at Song Yan coldly and whispered, “Come out with me.”\nSong Yan shrugged and followed him to the garden outside. Through the French windows, he could see the happy figures of the children playing with Qiu Rong. He stood facing Jin Yang with his walking stick. They stared at each other with disdain and contempt.\nSong Yan cleared his throat and asked, “What? Do you want to hit me?”\n“I can’t win you in a fight now, but if I’m heavily injured again, Qiu Tong will be very upset, right?”\n“She hates being indebted to others, just like you. How long do you think she will remember my kindness?”\nSong Yan raised his hand and pulled down the collar of his pajamas, revealing his exquisite collarbone. There was a clear red lipstick mark on it.\nSong Yan had deliberately bumped into Qiu Tong when she was changing his bandage. He looked at Jin Yang proudly and said, “Your facial features are nearly identical to mine.”\n“Do you think Qiu Tong will mix us up in the middle of the night and end up running to my bed…”\nSmack! Jin Yang punched Song Yan’s left cheek.\nSong Yan’s body swayed as he crashed into a metal rack in the garden. He was in so much pain that he grimaced. His eyes were filled with anger and viciousness as he growled, “You only know how to be a brute with me. When we were at the abandoned factory, you could have used the guards as cover to rush over and save Qiu Tong.”\n“What were you thinking back then? Every time Qiu Tong is in danger, what else do you do but wait anxiously at the back?”\nSong Yan raised his index finger and pointed it at Jin Yang. He spat out blood and gritted his teeth. “Jin Yang, I look down on you!”\n“You’re a coward. You think you have many responsibilities on your shoulders, but in reality? You only hide behind your status!”\n“No wonder Jin Tao chose to support you as the president back then. It’s because you’re easy to manipulate. Do you understand?”\nSong Yan laughed wildly as he continued. “Sooner or later, you’ll lose everything you cherish, just like me! When the time comes, I want to see if you can rise again like me… you can’t!”\nJin Yang clenched his fists tightly. His eyes were filled with surging anger, but he quickly released his grip.\nUnder the glaring sun, Jin Yang walked to Song Yan and stared straight at him. “You don’t understand what responsibility is at all.”\nSong Yan looked at him with mocking eyes and shook his head before turning to leave.\nQiu Tong frowned as she listened to their argument.\nShe had a nagging feeling that there seemed to be a deep estrangement and misunderstanding between the brothers, and this was definitely not something that happened overnight. Instead, it seemed to be caused by the accumulation of multiple problems over many years.\n“Mommy, Grandpa went into the laboratory again!”\nQiu Xingyu ran to her side barefooted. She grumbled, “He’s been cooped up in the laboratory recently, refusing to play with me. He’s also unwilling to talk.”\n“Does Grandpa not like me?”",

      "content": "Chapter 287: Changing His Way Of Thinking\n“Grandpa might be busy with his research. Little Yu is the most obedient baby. She has to be obedient.”\nQiu Tong hugged Qiu Xingyu and looked towards the laboratory worriedly.\nEver since the gun battle at the abandoned factory, Qiu Rong’s personality had undergone a huge change. He believed that all the danger they encountered stemmed from the human modification plan, from his inability to develop a successful drug.\nQiu Rong seemed to have fallen into an obsession. He began to study the drug all night, even cutting into his sleep time.\nIn just two days, he looked so haggard that he seemed to have become another person.\nIn the laboratory, Qiu Rong grabbed his hair in frustration. He slammed the table angrily and destroyed the failed concoction for the umpteenth time.\nAfter countless adjustments to the chemical formula, Qiu Rong had added all the ingredients he could think of, but the drug could not be blended no matter what. Qiu Rong paced around anxiously.\nQiu Xingyuan and Ye Luan secretly ran to his side and brought over two high stools to sit beside him.\nYe Luan had once read some information about the modification plan from his father. He read the complicated equations carefully.\nQiu Xingyuan silently analyzed the failed drug. He suddenly thought of something and looked up at Qiu Rong.\n“Grandpa, why are you trying to find a component that can merge the various components of the drug?”\nHis clear voice made Qiu Rong regain some rationality. He took off his glasses and rubbed his forehead.\n“Because if the drug is to be injected into the human body, it has to complement the cells.”\n“If there’s no way to merge the separate components of the drug, the chemicals will scatter like loose sand and be useless.”\nQiu Rong had studied nearly every single ingredient from both Western and Chinese medicine. At this moment, he was already at his wits’ end.\nQiu Xingyuan stood up with a heavy expression and drew a sketch on white paper.\nAfter a while, he suddenly said, “We can choose ingredients that naturally stick to each other to make the drug. This way, there won’t be a need for a fusing agent. They can react and merge themselves, eventually forming a stabilized drug.”\nQiu Rong felt like his head had been hit by a wooden stick.\nAs an authoritative expert in biochemistry, Qiu Rong had trapped himself in a fixed thinking pattern. He had experimented according to the so-called rules, but he had never thought about whether he could find another way to achieve his goals.\nQiu Xingyuan was a child. He might lack professional knowledge, but he was brave enough to try different means.\nYe Luan pointed at the chemical components on the paper in agreement. “I’ve seen replacements for these drugs in Dad’s notebook. We can try to replace them according to Qiu Xingyuan’s method. Perhaps, we’ve already found the path to success.”\nQiu Rong felt much more relaxed. He looked at Qiu Xingyuan and said with admiration, “You are both the hope of the future. You’re smarter than me. Are you willing to help me with the drug research?”\nQiu Xingyuan and Ye Luan exchanged looks before nodding with sparkling eyes.\nThey placed their hands on the back of Qiu Rong’s hand, and the trio grinned at each other.\nAt this moment, the setting sun outside the window shone onto the laboratory, coincidentally landing on a glass tube. It seemed to be a good omen.\n…\nIn a demolition area of S City, Bo Lang and the members of the Vulture Organization were hiding to recuperate.\nJin Yang and the guards had extremely accurate marksmanship. Bo Lang had been shot in the shoulder and legs, making it difficult for him to walk.\nHe tore open the bottle of antiseptic with his mouth and poured it on his wound. The intense pain made his eyes turn red. Bo Lang then dug into the open and festering wound with his bare hands to dug out the bullet. He then threw it on the ground beside him.\nHe took two big mouthfuls of hard liquor and turned to look at the remaining few people.\nDamn Jin Yang and Qiu Tong! He would settle this score with them!\nBo Lang coughed twice and struggled to sit up. He found the satellite phone he was carrying and dialed an encrypted number.\nThe phone beeped a few times. A man’s deep voice came from the other end. “Why are you calling this number?”\n“Unless there are special circumstances, it’s best if we don’t meet or contact each other. You should understand…”\nWhen Bo Lang heard his cold words, he sneered and said, “More than half of my brothers have died. Is that considered a special situation? You guys hide in office buildings and enjoy your lives while the cold wind blows outside as my brothers fight for you!”\n“I need to see you. Now! Immediately!”\nBo Lang spoke threateningly. Surprise and conflict flashed across Terrence’s eyes.\nYu Ge sat in the swivel chair playing with a dart. He stared at Terrence, who was hiding in the corner, and tugged at his tie. “Who is it?”\nTerrence thought for a moment before explaining the situation to him. Yu Ge slammed his desk and leaned forward slightly to stare at him. “Let him come to the company.” Yu Ge pouted. He was dissatisfied at Terrence’s lack of action.\n“Do you want to disobey orders?”\nA ruthless glint flashed across Yu Ge’s eyes. Terrence took two deep breaths and frowned. In the end, he gave in and said to Bo Lang, “I’ll send someone to pick you up.”\n“Send me the address.”",

      "content": "Chapter 288: Joining Forces For Revenge\nAt Liqing Corporation, Yu Ge’s office had two French windows, giving it a wide view.\nYu Ge was wearing a casual sports suit as he played a virtual reality golf game. He kept swinging the golf club in his hand, hitting out beautiful balls. Yu Ge took off his virtual reality goggles and walked to Terrence. He handed the club to him and said, “Don’t perform too badly!”\n“Since the CEO believes in me and has handed over everything here to me, you should be happy for me.”\nYu Ge gave a carefree smile. From the moment Qiu Tong left the Liqing Corporation, he had thought of a way to contact the CEO, who was far away overseas. He had persuaded the CEO to hand over all the power to him. Perhaps it was out of guilt, but the CEO readily agreed to Yu Ge’s request.\nAt this moment, the Liqing Corporation in S City was completely in Yu Ge’s hands.\nTerrence frowned and stared at the elevator. Ding! The man came out in a wheelchair, pushed into the office by his assistant.\nBo Lang stared hard at Terrence with his bright blue left eye. “You sure have a good life,” he said sarcastically.\nTerrence and Bo Lang were high-ranking members of the Vulture Organization, but they were in charge of different aspects.\nBo Lang was like a mouse wandering in the dark as he completed the missions assigned to him. His hands were stained with blood and his body was covered in countless scars. On the other hand, Terrence was like a businessman living in front of a camera. He was the organization’s white glove, accumulating wealth for them.\nBecause of this, Bo Lang’s attitude towards Terrence was always conflicted and disdainful.\nIf the damage from this gun battle had not been so serious, Bo Lang would definitely not have humbled himself to seek Terrence’s help.\nYu Ge stared at Bo Lang curiously. He sat on the desk leisurely and pointed at his fake eye. “Can you take it out?”\nBo Lang glared at him fiercely. “Terrence, who is he? Get rid of him. I have something to tell you!”\nTerrence cleared his throat loudly, hinting at Bo Lang to shut up.\n“He’s the son of the CEO of the Liqing Corporation. He’s the highest-ranked leader in this country.”\n“If you don’t want to die, be polite!”\nBo Lang looked at Yu Ge in surprise. He didn’t have the aura of a leader, and he had never heard of him before.\nYu Ge didn’t mind. He stared at Bo Lang with interest. “Who on earth beat you up like this? Terrence said that you’re the best in the organization but you don’t look like much. You are in such a wretched state!”\nBo Lang was furious, but because of Yu Ge’s status, he couldn’t scold him directly. He had no choice but to soften his tone and answer, “That b*tch!”\n“I didn’t expect her to be so lucky. If it weren’t for that group of masked criminals who suddenly appeared, she would already be dead!”\n“There was no way the president’s guards alone could have saved her.”\nBo Lang gritted his teeth and muttered angrily. Recalling the gunfight that day, he still felt that he had missed a good opportunity. “I should have shot her to death…”\nYu Ge frowned as he listened to his description. He felt that something was familiar.\nHe went to squat down in front of Bo Lang. “Woman? What’s her name?”\nBo Lang narrowed his eyes at Terrence and slowly spat out, “Qiu Tong.”\nYu Ge froze. He then looked up and laughed out loud. He almost lost his balance as he clapped. “What a coincidence!”\nYu Ge suddenly stopped smiling. He turned to look at Terrence and instructed in a commanding tone, “Send all our members stationed in S City to search for Qiu Tong’s current residence. At the same time, inform everyone to be on standby. Move out the moment we find her location.”\nAlthough Bo Lang had the goal of getting reinforcements, he didn’t expect things to progress so smoothly. He was also stunned.\nTerrence wanted to stop him, but Yu Ge’s eyes flashed with viciousness as he asked, “Do you want to disobey orders?”\nBo Lang looked at the tense atmosphere between the two. He piped up. “The weapons of the president’s guards are very good. They’ve all undergone special training and are very good at fighting. I’m afraid we’re not their match. We need to plan our countermeasures properly.”\nYu Ge patted his shoulder as a bloodthirsty smile appeared on his lips. “Don’t worry, I’ll avenge you!”\n“We have hundreds of members in S City, and we have sufficient weapons. Even if we use up half of our men in this fight, we can still capture them. Moreover, Terrence has two armored vehicles equipped with cannons in the arsenal.”\n“As long as we can find her hiding place, we will succeed.”\nYu Ge said confidently. Bo Lang looked at Terrence hesitantly. He had doubts about this new leader.\n“Qiu Tong, let’s see if you can still escape this time. We’ll meet again soon!”\nAs Yu Ge muttered to himself, he took out two bottles of wine from the liquor cabinet and handed them to Terrence and Bo Lang. He said proudly, “Friends, let’s have a toast to celebrate our victory in advance!”\nMeanwhile, Qiu Tong suddenly sneezed in the living room. There were many dark clouds blocking the sun outside the window. She looked up as frightened crows flew away from the electric lines. Qiu Tong bit her red lips as she fell into deep thought.",

      "content": "Chapter 289: Sudden Attack\n“Reporting! We have found the location of the target.”\nIn the office on the top floor of the Liqing Corporation, a member on the other end of the video call reported loudly. Yu Ge slapped his thigh. He picked up the gun from the drawer and hugged Terrence’s shoulder as he walked out. “Let’s go teach the President a lesson!”\nAn armored vehicle with a gun barrel drove out of the secret warehouse in the suburbs and sped towards the villa.\nYu Ge sat in the command car, wiping his lips excitedly.\nHe held the walkie-talkie and communicated with all the members of the Vulture Organization. “Remember, I want Qiu Tong captured alive. Even if you have to break her arms and legs, you have to bring her back to me still breathing!”\nThe members answered in unison, “Yes!”\nTerrence and Bo Lang exchanged glances, questioning Yu Ge’s rash, impulsive and unplanned attack.\nAfter half an hour of travel, the command vehicle and armored vehicle parked a hundred meters away from the villa, waiting for orders.\nYu Ge held the binoculars and looked ahead. He whispered, “So she’s hiding here?”\n“Attack them! I’ll give anyone who can bring Qiu Tong back alive a generous reward!”\nWith Yu Ge’s order, the members of the Vulture Organization swarmed out and shot down all the guards manning the front.\n…\nAn ear-piercing alarm resounded throughout the villa.\nQiu Xingyu widened her eyes in shock and hid behind the sofa.\nJin Yang and Song Yan rushed to the entrance. They were both stunned to see the fierce gunfire. No one expected the enemy to reorganize so quickly and find this place to launch a sudden attack.\nShao An ran back from the outside and said hurriedly, “Sir, the other party is very well-equipped. I’m afraid we can’t hold on.”\n“I’ll send the personal guards to flee with you, Miss Qiu and the children. Don’t worry, I’ll definitely protect them for you…”\nBoom! A rocket launcher accurately hit the roof of the villa, causing the entire building to shake.\nJin Yang held onto the wall and barely managed to steady himself. He snatched the map from Shao An. “Flee?”\n“They have surrounded us from all sides. How can we flee?”\nJin Yang threw the bulletproof vest to Song Yan and shouted at him. “Take the children and hide in the basement. Lock the door. The structure of the bomb shelter will make it difficult for even a tank to break in!”\nSong Yan narrowed his eyes and rejected him flatly. “I won’t be so cowardly as to hide! You can hide if you want to.”\nJin Yang gave him a vicious punch. Qiu Xingyu’s sobbing could be heard. Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao hid in the corner with Qiu Xingyu in their arms. No matter how calm and composed they usually were, their eyes were now flashing with panic and fear.\nAfter confirming the situation, Jin Yang looked up and said to Song Yan, “You’re injured. Don’t come out and cause trouble.”\nQiu Tong held Qiu Xingyu’s laptop and started the power grid system outside the villa as quickly as possible.\nShe hoped that this could delay the other party’s attack!\nSong Yan looked at their backs and hesitated for two seconds. He then turned around and walked to the children. He held their hands and walked towards the basement.\nQiu Xingyuan flailed his legs as he shouted that he would stay behind to accompany Qiu Tong and Jin Yang.\nSong Yan looked down at him with a ruthless expression. “What can you do for them? The enemy can charge in and abduct you. Do you want that to happen so that Qiu Tong has to go and exchange her life for yours? Shut up and stay here obediently…”\nQiu Rong and Ye Luan followed Song Yan to the basement and locked the door, blocking out the sound of gunshots.\nQiu Xingyu threw herself into Qiu Rong’s arms. Her face was covered in tears as she cried, “Why are there bad people everywhere?”\n“Grandpa, Mommy, and Uncle Jin Yang are clearly good people. Why do they have to attack us all the time?!”\nThe young child’s words touched Song Yan’s heart. He clenched his fists and slammed them against the wall of the bomb shelter. He thought to himself that Jin Yang must not die in the hands of others!\nBoom! The opponent’s attacks did not stop at all. It was as if there were endless cannonballs.\nJin Yang looked at the guards who were retreating and knew that they wouldn’t be able to hold on for long. He took out the seal he had brought with him and stuffed it into Shao An’s hand. “Go to the nearest neighboring city to find help. We will try our best to hold on until you return!”\nShao An shook his head with red eyes. “Sir, my mission is to protect you!”\nJin Yang shouted anxiously, “That is an order! Hurry up and leave…”\nQiu Tong patted Shao An’s shoulder and said, “The only person we can trust now is you. Hurry up and stop wasting time.”\nShao An gritted his teeth and left as quickly as possible under the cover of the guards.\nQiu Tong picked up a pair of binoculars. The left lens had already shattered but she could still spot Yu Ge sitting in the command vehicle from afar.\nShock flashed across her face for a moment before she regained her composure. “I underestimated him.”\nJin Yang protected her behind him and asked with deep affection, “Are you afraid?”",

      "content": "Chapter 290: Sacrificing Himself\nIn the face of these crazy attacks, any words were unnecessary. Qiu Tong held Jin Yang’s hand tightly and shook her head.\nJin Yang personally put the bulletproof vest on her, a faint smile on his lips. “Shao An will bring reinforcements back.”\nQiu Tong nodded and snatched the walkie-talkie over. She found a relatively safe corner and sat down. She cleared her throat and gave instructions. “Everyone, don’t linger in battle. We aim to exhaust the enemy’s ammunition. Disperse and attack the enemy. Delay their attack speed!”\n“Send a small team to guard the power source of the electric net. Snipers occupy the high ground. Do not let any enemy near the main entrance.”\nQiu Tong had clear plans for the remaining guards and placed them in the precise positions.\nAs Qiu Tong’s plan was executed, the Vulture Organization’s assault speed clearly slowed down. Their casualties were increasing. Yu Ge sat in the command vehicle and shouted at them, “Charge! Don’t retreat!”\nBo Lang looked at his crazed expression and used his eyes to signal his subordinates to fall to the back and watch.\nTerrence felt a headache coming on as he rubbed his temples. He knew that he could do nothing to dissuade Yu Ge at this moment, so he simply let it be.\nRelying on Qiu Tong’s tactics, the guards manage to hold out for two hours. Everyone was exhausted and it was difficult to even pull a trigger.\nThe members of the Vulture Organization slowly approached the villa and tried to lure Qiu Tong and Jin Yang out.\nJin Yang and Qiu Tong sat behind the sofa with their backs to each other. They used the furniture to construct a fortress-like structure to block the gun fire from the other side. Qiu Tong picked up the submachine gun and magazine and whispered, “I don’t regret meeting you.”\nJin Yang’s eyes sparkled. He hugged her neck and kissed her red lips. “This might be our last chance to speak. I want to tell you that I love you, Qiu Tong!”\nThis desperate confession made their eyes glisten with tears.\nThe sound of footsteps could be heard behind him as Qiu Tong raised her gun. Song Yan staggered backward with an iron plate in his hand. “It’s me!”\n“I thought you guys needed help. I didn’t expect you to still have the time to confess your love for each other.”\n“Keep your lives and you can say those words in the future…”\nSong Yan picked up a gun from the ground and sat cross-legged beside Qiu Tong.\nJin Yang saw that he was a little stunned and asked anxiously, “Where are the children?”\nSong Yan gritted his teeth and tightened the bandage around his waist. Large beads of sweat rolled down his forehead, and his body trembled uncontrollably. However, he forged on as he said, “They’re hiding in the bomb shelter in the basement. With Qiu Rong protecting them, they don’t need me.”\n“I came up to help you. How can I let you be a hero by yourself?”\nA machine gun suddenly fired from the opposite side of the entrance. Jin Yang bent down and held Qiu Tong’s gaze as he elegantly raised the muzzle and took aim. A single bullet pierced through the middle of the other party’s eyebrows. The sound of gunfire was temporarily halted.\nSong Yan recalled some childhood memories and said mockingly, “Back then, Dad was willing to teach only you how to shoot.”\n“He said that I’m playful and not someone who can control my temper.”\nSong Yan sneered as he lifted his gun. He aimed it at Jin Yang, and pulled the trigger.\nThe bullet brushed past Jin Yang and flew straight into the heart of a Vulture member who had sneaked in. He fell to the ground with his eyes widened. Even in death, he didn’t expect anyone to have such fast and accurate marksmanship and nimble judgment.\nJin Yang frowned and stared at him. Song Yan smiled contemptuously as he loaded the gun.\n“He doesn’t know that my slingshot has always been accurate!”\nA sense of helplessness rose in Qiu Tong’s heart when she heard their conversation.\nThe members of the Vulture Organization were gathered at the entrance. The other party had determined the corner where Jin Yang and the rest were. They surged in and shot indiscriminately. Qiu Tong took out her dagger, quickly and nimbly slitting the necks of everyone who approached, so that they could save some bullets.\nYu Ge couldn’t bear it anymore. He pushed open the door of the command vehicle and snatched the gun from the bodyguard beside him. He walked towards the villa.\nSong Yan’s wound had split open. He couldn’t support himself as he leaned against the sofa and panted.\nJin Yang looked at him and said with concern, “Hide and rest for a while. Leave this to me.”\nSong Yan curled his lips into a mocking smile and retorted weakly, “I’m afraid you’ll aim the gun at me!”\nWhile the two of them were bickering, Yu Ge jumped in from the window. He aimed the gun at Song Yan and said loudly, “Go to hell!”\nJin Yang looked over at the voice. Without hesitation, he pounced toward Song Yan and shielded him.\nThe bullet entered Jin Yang’s left chest, and his pupils dilated. Song Yan didn’t even have time to think. He looked at Jin Yang’s face and stammered in disbelief, “Why! Why did you save me?”\nQiu Tong ran over from afar. Jin Yang smiled brightly at her and said to Song Yan, “You’re my younger brother.”\n“Promise me that you’ll take care of Qiu Tong and the children for me. Don’t make them sad…”",

      "content": "Chapter 291: Heart Surgery\n“Jin Yang!!”\nQiu Tong felt as if her heart was being torn apart. She went crazy with bloodshot eyes as she raised her machine gun and aimed it at Yu Ge. She kept pulling the trigger. Bullets rained down on the other party. Yu Ge’s bodyguards felt fear in their hearts as they protected him and retreated.\nAt this moment, Shao An had arrived with reinforcements.\nIn five minutes, they had chased the Vulture members out of the villa area and forced them to disperse.\nShao An returned with the seal, his face covered with injuries. The next second, he saw Jin Yang lying in a pool of blood. He was shocked and wanted to kneel down and put pressure on the wound to stop the bleeding. “Sir… medic, come over quickly!”\nQiu Tong was oblivious to the movements around her. She covered Jin Yang’s wound with her hands, desperately trying to infuse her special ability to him. Hot tears streaked down the corners of her eyes and hit the back of Jin Yang’s hand.\nJin Yang raised his hand weakly and held her face. He smiled faintly and said, “Don’t waste your energy.”\nHer Esper ability could allow the wound to heal quickly, but at the same time, it would consume Qiu Tong’s energy.\nJin Yang said with difficulty, “As long as you’re alright!”\nQiu Tong shook her head fiercely. She held Jin Yang’s palm tightly. “You can’t leave me…”\nThe medical staff rushed to the scene to lift Jin Yang up and transport out for surgery as soon as possible.\nQiu Tong refused to let go. She stared at Shao An and said, “I’ll perform the surgery for him!”\nShao An understood her feelings, but Qiu Tong didn’t have any experience in surgery. He gestured at the presidential guards beside him with his eyes, and they restrained Qiu Tong. Shao An said earnestly, “I know you’re worried about Sir. This medical team has performed hundreds of open chest surgeries. They were the ones who treated Sir’s serious injuries in the past. Sir will definitely be safe this time.”\n“Calm down and don’t disturb them. Okay?”\n“We all care about Sir very much and hope that he can survive! You’re not the only one in pain!”\nShao An was equally worried. He was practically shouting by now.\nQiu Tong looked at him blankly, looking as if she was desperately holding onto the sliver of hope. She muttered, “The surgery will be successful.”\n“Jin Yang promised me that he would bring me to many places. He promised Little Yu that he would give her a younger sister. How could he go back on his words?”\nQiu Tong’s hair was loose. She bit her nails and squatted by the wall, staring straight at the makeshift operating table.\nSong Yan bandaged his own wound and walked to the glass window. He looked at Jin Yang lying on the operating table as unforgettable images flashed across his mind. He had never thought that Jin Yang would sacrifice himself for him.\nPerhaps it was as Jin Yang had said, it was just instinct.\nSong Yan couldn’t help but wonder if he would block that bullet for Jin Yang if the situation had been reversed.\nHe didn’t know the answer…\nThe villa had a very sturdy structure. Only some glass panels in the first floor were damaged by the attack. Shao An arranged for the reinforcement troops to tidy up the place. When Qiu Rong and the children came out of the basement and learned that Jin Yang was seriously injured, they surrounded Qiu Tong.\nWhen Qiu Tong saw Qiu Xingyu’s worried eyes, she wanted to squeeze out a smile, but her tears fell uncontrollably.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao took the initiative to walk to her side. They opened their young but strong arms and hugged her.\nQiu Xingyuan imitated Jin Yang’s usual act of gently patting Qiu Tong’s back. He heard her sobbing and said seriously. “Uncle Jin Yang will definitely be fine.” At this moment, everyone in the villa had the same wish. They were all waiting for news from the medical team.\nAt dusk, one of the medical staff walked out. He took off his mask and protective suit and looked at Shao An. “Fortunately, the bullet missed Mr. President’s heart by 0.2 centimeters. The surgery was successful, but Mr. President’s body was severely injured, and many of his nerves were damaged.”\n“I cannot determine when he will wake up or even whether he can wake up.”\nThe medical staff’s words made everyone heave a sigh of relief even as anxiety clouded their hearts again.\nUnable to determine if Jin Yang would wake up. It was possible that he would continue to be in a coma and have to rely on medical devices to survive.\nQiu Tong’s hands trembled slightly as she tried her best to regain her rationality. “Can I visit him now?”\nThe medical staff nodded. “Try not to stay for too long. Mr. President needs an absolutely quiet environment.”\nQiu Tong forced a smile and let Shao An handle the rest. She changed into her protective suit and walked to the bed. Looking at Jin Yang’s pale, handsome face, Qiu Tong sat down beside him. “Can you bear to let Song Yan take care of me?”\n“I know. You must be trying to scare me. I’ll wait for you to wake up.”\nQiu Tong’s red lips had gone pale. She quietly placed her hand on Jin Yang’s chest and tried her best to transfer the last trace of her special ability to him.\nSome color returned to Jin Yang’s face. Qiu Tong heaved a sigh of relief and placed her head in his palm.\n“Don’t make me wait too long!”",

      "content": "Chapter 292: Coma For Five Days\nThe moon was bright. When Qiu Tong came out of the room, she saw Song Yan squatting on the ground.\nSong Yan saw her from the corner of his eye. He stood up and asked, “How… is he?”\nQiu Tong saw the bleeding bandage on his waist and pointed at a guest room toward the front. “Come with me. I’ll change your dressing.”\nThe room was filled with a heavy atmosphere. Song Yan’s wound had split open. As Qiu Tong handled Song Yan’s wound, he didn’t seem to feel the pain and didn’t make a sound. She frowned as she stared at the wound. “Why do you hate him?”\nThey were twin brothers. What kind of hatred would drive Song Yan to target Jin Yang like this? Even the mention of him would bring an intense sense of hatred.\nSong Yan lowered his head and fiddled with a bullet shell in his hand. A self-deprecating smile hung on his lips as he said indifferently, “Hate?”\n“I used to trust and rely on him a lot. I looked up to him as a model example.”\nCountless images appeared in Song Yan’s mind. The dusty memories surged over, causing him to feel a suffocating pain in his heart.\nQiu Tong sat quietly beside him and listened to his narration.\nSong Yan looked at the shadows of the trees dancing outside the window. “Our father constantly chose between us brothers since we were young. He wanted the best to become the president and hold the highest authority and power. Jin Yang is very smart and obedient. Father will often praise him.”\n“I’m envious, but not jealous. I’ve never even thought of snatching anything from him.”\nSong Yan curled his lips into a bitter smile. “But that’s not what Jin Yang thinks. Father is very strict with us. He doesn’t allow us to love any living thing. I secretly raised a stray dog outside and only brought Jin Yang to see it…”\n“The next day, I found the dog’s corpse. Its stiff limbs were straight, and its eyes were filled with lingering fear.”\nSong Yan could not forget the scene at that time. The seeds of disappointment grew in his heart.\nWhen he was young, he was ignorant of relationships between men and women. Song Yan liked a girl from the same class, but the other party broke up with him only after a short while. The reason was that she had fallen in love with Jin Yang and wanted to be with him!\nSong Yan had lost the people and things he cared about one after another. Resentment began to blind his eyes.\n“From that moment on, I swore to snatch away what Jin Yang treasured as well! I’ll let him taste the pain of loss…”\nQiu Tong saw the conflict and frustration in his eyes. “I think there might be a misunderstanding between the two of you. Jin Yang wouldn’t do such a thing. He has always cared about you. I can feel that he has a brotherly bond with you. He’s also accommodating you and trying to make it up to you.”\nSong Yan stood up silently and stared back at the room where Jin Yang was in. He turned around and left silently.\n…\nJin Yang had been in a coma for five days. Every day, Qiu Tong would treat him with her special ability.\nQiu Xingyuan looked at her gradually weakening appearance with an aching heart. He discussed with Ye Luan and Qiu Xingqiao about making some nourishing soup for her, or taking turns to watch over Jin Yang. He wanted to reduce Qiu Tong’s burden. She sensed their concern and hugged them in relief, silently absorbing their strength.\nThe living room was very quiet. Suddenly, Shao An’s voice was heard from the second floor.\nQiu Tong let go of Qiu Xingyuan and ran upstairs. She hit her ankle against the corner of the coffee table, but she couldn’t care less about the pain as she barged into the ward.\nShao An was so excited that tears flowed down his cheeks. He pointed at the man on the bed who had opened his eyes.\nQiu Tong hesitantly took two steps forward, afraid that she was hallucinating.\nJin Yang waved at her weakly and called out her name. Qiu Tong heard his familiar voice and pounced onto the bed. She held his hand tightly, holding back her tears as she asked, “How are you feeling now? Does your wound still hurt?”\nJin Yang shook his head. The medical staff rushed over after receiving the news and conducted a meticulous examination on him.\nQiu Tong clenched her fists nervously. She only heaved a sigh of relief when she heard the medical staff say, “Mr. President’s health is no longer a problem. He just needs to recuperate in peace.” Everyone in the room had already tactfully left, leaving only Qiu Tong to accompany Jin Yang.\nThat chaotic gunfight seemed to have happened just yesterday. Qiu Tong looked at him quietly and said, “You’ve already been asleep for five days.”\nJin Yang’s eyes flashed with apology. He wanted to squeeze her hand but his wound ached and he frowned.\nQiu Tong glared at him and ordered, “Don’t move. I’ll be keeping an eye on you!”\nJin Yang smiled and nodded. It was as if he had been having an incomparably long dream for the past few days. He could hear Qiu Tong whispering to him every night about what she wanted to do with him. Jin Yang wanted to answer, but he couldn’t open his eyes.\nSensing his burning gaze, Qiu Tong thought that he had something important to say and leaned forward to kiss him.\nJin Yang smiled and said, “Were you serious when you said that you wanted to give Little Yu a younger sister?”\nQiu Tong frowned at his mischievous smile. She raised her fist high and sighed before answering, “Yes!”",

      "content": "Chapter 293: The Conflicting Truth\nLate at night, the sound of a hubcap rolling across the floor could be heard in the quiet and cold villa.\nIn the rehabilitation room at the top floor of the villa, Jin Yang pushed his wheelchair away and gripped the rehabilitation equipment tightly, wanting to speed up his recovery.\nIn the shadows in the corner, Qiu Tong stared at him quietly, clenching her fists tightly as she silently cheered him on.\nJin Yang soon became so exhausted that he trembled all over and nearly fell off the device, Qiu Tong hurriedly ran out to stabilize him.\nQiu Tong wiped his sweat with a towel. Jin Yang avoided her gaze with a look of annoyance.\nDuring this period, everyone had been very careful about Jin Yang’s feelings. But he felt very suffocated.\nQiu Tong placed her hand gently on his shoulder and massaged his tensed muscles. She whispered, “Don’t be anxious. Take your time.”\nTime passed quickly. Half a month later, Jin Yang was able to move freely. Apart from not being able to carry heavy items, he was no different from a normal person.\nQiu Tong often saw Song Yan pacing back and forth at the bedroom door. He seemed to want to thank Jin Yang, but he always chose to give up and turn around to leave. It was as if there was a wall separating them. Qiu Tong held a glass of hot milk and gently pushed the door open.\nJin Yang came out of the bathroom with water dripping from the ends of his hair. He wiped his hair with a towel, his eyes as bright and innocent as a young man.\nQiu Tong handed him the milk, wanting to tell him about Song Yan.\nJin Yang took two sips. Before she could react, he wrapped his arms around her neck and transferred the warm milk into her mouth. The fragrance lingered in their mouths as she placed her soft hands on his thin waist and accidentally pulled off the towel covering his lower body.\nJin Yang let go of her lips and caressed her earlobe with his fingertips. He whispered, “Are you in a hurry?”\nQiu Tong’s face instantly turned red. She wanted to explain herself, but Jin Yang didn’t give her any chance. He gently pulled her towards the bed. Qiu Tong was worried that any vigorous action would affect his recently healed wound, so she followed obediently.\nShe raised her fingertips and carefully traced Jin Yang’s features under the mottled light.\nHer warm fingers caressed his straight eyebrows, his deep eyes and his thin lips. Qiu Tong couldn’t control her emotions as she hooked her arms around his neck and kissed him. Complicated emotions surged into her heart. She gently pushed Jin Yang’s shoulders and pressed him onto the bed. Her slender and fair legs straddled his waist, and her perky buttocks pressed against him as she deliberately twisted and squeezed.\nJin Yang’s eyes darkened as he tried to take off her pajamas. However, Qiu Tong stopped him and slowly unhooked her bra strap.\nIn the ambiguous light, Qiu Tong bit her soft red lips. Her plump and round breasts broke free from the restraints of her undergarment. Jin Yang’s Adam’s apple bobbed uncontrollably as he eagerly grabbed Qiu Tong’s buttocks.\nQiu Tong teased him for a long time before allowing him to enter her.\nThe two of them sighed in satisfaction. Jin Yang and Qiu Tong moved in unison, with Qiu Tong gently massaging his chest and swaying her hips.\nJin Yang raised his hand and held her soft chest, his breathing heavy and rapid.\nThis long-awaited moment of love brought with it the urgency of someone who had experienced the touch of death. Qiu Tong’s face was filled with joy as her red lips let out a soft moan. In the end, she went limp and laid on Jin Yang’s body, letting him control their movements as he pleased.\nIt was only in the wee hours of the morning when the sky outside the window started to light up that Jin Yang finally stopped. Qiu Tong’s eyes were misty as she laid beside him.\nIn her half-asleep state, she didn’t forget to tell him what Song Yan had said. Jin Yang paused for a moment before gently stroking her sweat-drenched curly hair and planting a gentle kiss on her brows. “Thank you.”\nThe next morning, Song Yan appeared at the bedroom door as usual. He placed the breakfast he had prepared on the floor and turned to leave.\nThe door opened at that moment and Jin Yang met his gaze. He said lightly, “Shall we have a chat?”\nSong Yan frowned and followed him to the balcony on the top floor.\nThe morning breeze blew across his face. Jin Yang looked at the rising sun before turning to look at Song Yan. “That stray dog was poisoned by my father. I wanted to stop him, but I didn’t succeed in the end. He didn’t want us to know how to sympathize with the weak.”\nSong Yan’s pupils dilated, but he did not answer.\nJin Yang heaved a long sigh of relief. “As for your girlfriend, she did confess to me, but I rejected her.”\n“I’ve never had the thought of fighting with you. Moreover, those are things and people that I don’t care about at all. You’re my younger brother. Father hopes that we’ll be afraid of each other. He relies on you to keep me in check, while using me to agitate you.”\n“But I know that you’re actually a kind person. It’s just that you’re easily influenced by others.”\nSong Yan couldn’t withstand the impact of the truth. He shook his head repeatedly and took a few steps back. His thin lips curled into a bitter smile as he denied it. “No, impossible. You’re lying. I don’t believe…”",

      "content": "Chapter 294: Ye Luan As A Hostage\nAfter learning the truth, Song Yan felt that he couldn’t face it, so he chose to leave the villa overnight to digest it alone.\nShao An summarized the information about the attack. Qiu Tong and Jin Yang analyzed it seriously and felt that there were two separate terrorist groups hiding in the dark. They were interested in the drug or in Qiu Tong. The masked criminal group would always appear at the critical moment to kill her.\nThe situation had become tricky, but they couldn’t find any clues that could confirm the other party’s identity.\nQiu Tong frowned. The children were sensible and obedient as they gathered in the corner to play quietly. She looked at them with gentle eyes and quickly sensed that something was wrong. She abruptly stood up and walked to Qiu Xingyuan’s side. “Where’s Ye Luan?”\nQiu Xingyuan put down his chemicals and looked at Qiu Xingqiao.\nQiu Xingqiao replied, “He said that he was going out to meet a friend. He left at around eight in the morning.”\nQiu Tong turned to stare at the clock hanging on the wall. It was already five in the evening.\nShe dialed Ye Luan’s number. A cold female voice sounded. “The number you’ve dialed is unavailable for now. Please try again later.”\nQiu Tong clenched her fists in panic and instructed Shao An to immediately search for Ye Luan.\nThrough the surveillance video around the villa, he learned that Ye Luan had indeed left by himself on a bus heading to the city. He was last seen by the surveillance cameras in an underground car park. There was no trace of him after that.\nQiu Tong stared fixedly at the screen and saw that familiar van in the parking lot.\nShe instantly felt uneasy as her phone rang.\nQiu Tong looked at the encrypted number and her heart sank.\nJin Yang answered the call and pressed the speaker button. Bo Lang’s voice came from the other end.\n“Qiu Tong, are you surprised? We might meet again soon!”\nBo Lang motioned for a member to kick Ye Luan, who had fallen to the ground. He groaned in pain.\nBo Lang placed the phone in front of Ye Luan, gesturing for him to speak. Ye Luan gritted her teeth and glared at him with hatred.\n“Ye Luan? Is that you? How are you now? Auntie Qiu will be there to save you soon! Hang in there!”\nBo Lang walked to a cracked glass mirror and adjusted his fake blue eye. “I only told him that I’m his father’s friend and that I’m in danger, someone is hunting me. I have what they want.”\n“I didn’t expect this kid to be so stupid as to run out alone to see me.”\nBo Lang clicked his tongue and laughed. He kicked Ye Luan’s chest with the tip of his shoe. Seeing his body curled up in pain, he said to Qiu Tong, “He probably wanted to resolve this by himself because he’s afraid of implicating you guys. Your relationship is really great. I’m impressed.”\n“I’ll give you two hours to think about this. Come and see me yourself.”\nBo Lang was in an enclosed place and his intact eye revealed a fierce killing intent. “I don’t need you to bring the drug with you this time. I just want your life! In two hours’ time. Exchange your life for his. Otherwise, I’ll kill him.”\n“Wait to collect his corpse…”\nWhen Ye Luan heard their conversation, he endured the pain and shouted, “Auntie Qiu, don’t worry about me! I’m not afraid of death!”\nBo Lang hung up the phone. He grabbed Ye Luan’s neck forcefully and lifted him up. His thin body flailed in the air. Ye Luan’s face had already turned purple, and he could barely breathe.\nYe Luan’s pupils dilated as Bo Lang abruptly let go, causing him to fall harshly to the ground.\nBo Lang stepped on his palm and crushed it harshly. Looking at Ye Luan’s stubborn eyes, he said kindly, “You’re really similar to your father. You’re as stubborn as him. You want to be a saint to save the world and sacrifice yourself to protect others.”\n“I’m not lying to you. I’m indeed your father’s friend. I’m the friend who personally sent him to the netherworld.”\nBo Lang gestured with his hand like a pistol and placed it on Ye Luan’s temple. “I killed your father.”\n“Before he died, he seemed to be calling your name. He said that he hoped that you would be brave enough to survive for him.”\nYe Luan’s eyes were bloodshot. He struggled with all his might, but it was useless. Bo Lang slapped him before instructing the members of the organization to tie a bomb to Ye Luan’s body. “Don’t worry. I’ll send you to reunite with him soon. Of course, there’s also your favorite Aunt Qiu!”\nBo Lang checked all the settings in the room. It would be a death trap for Qiu Tong. As long as she dared to come, she would not be able to escape.\nAt the villa, Qiu Tong received the address and prepared to leave immediately.\nJin Yang held her hand. “I’ll go with you.”\nQiu Tong opened her mouth to refuse, but when she met his dark eyes, she finally smiled and nodded.\nThe car sped along the highway. Qiu Tong looked down at the address Bo Lang had sent her. It was an abandoned military base. The other buildings had already been demolished half a year ago, leaving only one as the demolition had yet to be completed.\nIt seemed like Bo Lang had planned everything precisely…\nQiu Tong looked at Jin Yang worriedly as she secretly hid something in her sleeve.",

      "content": "Chapter 295: Life For A Life\nAt the military base, the Vulture Organization’s flag fluttered on the top floor.\nQiu Xingyu activated the infrared surveillance system software developed by Qiu Xingyu to scan the buildings.\nThe data showed that the members of the Vulture Organization were all hidden very well. Even snipers lying in ambush at the most advantageous vantage point would be unable to kill any terrorists.\nBo Lang had meticulously set up the venue. He treated the building as a prison and waited for Qiu Tong to deliver her life.\nQiu Tong knew that she had no other choice. She opened the car door and Jin Yang followed her out.\nQiu Tong pushed him back in shock. “What are you trying to do? I’ll bring Ye Luan out. Wait here for my news.”\nJin Yang smiled and ruffled her curly brown hair. “I’m someone who has experienced death. Would I be afraid? I’ll accompany you. No matter what happens, we will be together. You promised me that, didn’t you?”\nQiu Tong stared at the ground for a moment before looking up with a bright smile. “Alright!”\nThe members of the Vulture Organization pushed Qiu Tong and Jin Yang in. In an enclosed space, Bo Lang sat beside Ye Luan and held a remote control. “Do you see the bomb on him? If you dare to move, I’ll immediately turn him into countless pieces…”\nBo Lang was in desperate straits now. Only five of his brothers were left after the two gun battles.\nEven if Yu Ge and Terrence didn’t allow him to seek revenge, he would still choose to disobey orders.\nBo Lang pointed at the black-and-white photos on the wall. “No one will be able to walk out of here alive today. I’ve already betrayed the Vulture Organization. Even if I live, I will be punished. But you have to pay with your lives for my brothers. Kneel!”\nBo Lang pointed at Qiu Tong angrily. She frowned, wanting to mock his stupidity and ridiculousness.\nBut Bo Lang placed the dagger on Ye Luan’s neck, so she had no choice but to go down on one knee.\nA Vulture member kicked her from behind and stepped on her other leg, forcing her to go down on both knees.\nBo Lang handed the remote control to a member and ordered someone to restrain Jin Yang. He then pulled Qiu Tong up by her hair.\nQiu Tong stared at him coldly. Enraged by her gaze, Bo Lang clenched his fists and punched her abdomen.\n“We could have gotten along very well. If only you had just given me the drug, I would have given you a large sum of money and let you live a carefree life anywhere in the world. Your children could have had the best childhood. You could have lived without worries!”\n“But you chose to go against me and the Vulture Organization…”\nQiu Tong spat at him and said coldly, “Even if the drug is developed, I won’t give it to you.”\nIf the drug fell into the hands of bad people, it would probably become a spark that would destroy the entire society.\nQiu Tong thought of the apocalyptic era she was in. There were zombies everywhere, and she was in a state of fear every moment. She had to fight non-stop in exchange for a chance of survival. She absolutely couldn’t let the children live in such a world!\nBo Lang sneered and took out his gun, aiming it at her.\nJin Yang was so nervous that he wanted to rush over. However, he saw Qiu Tong take out a syringe from her sleeve and inject it into her body. In an instant, her eyes turned red. Her breathing was hot and rapid. She broke Bo Lang’s arm at lightning speed and snatched this gun, aiming it at his heart.\n“Don’t move! Otherwise, I’ll kill him!”\nQiu Tong shouted hoarsely. Bo Lang twitched in pain, indicating for everyone to calm down and listen to her request.\nBo Lang had claimed that he would die with Qiu Tong, but in reality, he had prepared a way out for himself.\nWhen Qiu Tong came to this enclosed space, she spotted a pit behind Ye Luan and confirmed that it could be a path of escape.\nBo Lang’s arm had been broken, and it dangled at the side of his body. He looked at her suspiciously. “You used the modification drug!”\nHe instantly thought of the drug. Qiu Tong kept silent in tacit agreement while holding him hostage. She slowly walked to Ye Luan’s side.\nBefore she left the villa, she went to the laboratory on the top floor without telling anyone and stole the half-finished drug.\nQiu Tong knew that this was the only way, so she was willing to use her body as a test subject…\n“Remove the bomb on him!”\nQiu Tong motioned for the members of the organization to take action. Bo Lang could only frown and nod.\nJin Yang broke free from the restraints and protected Ye Luan. Qiu Tong motioned for them to hide near the pit.\nYe Luan shouted anxiously, “Auntie Qiu, what are you going to do?”\nQiu Tong could feel her heart beating rapidly. She could hear thumping sounds in her mind, and her blood and muscles felt like they were burning. “You guys leave first. I’ll catch up to you guys soon.”\nAs Qiu Tong spoke, Bo Lang slammed his entire body into her, causing the two of them to fall to the ground. Qiu Tong quickly kicked the gun away as the Vulture members charged at her with daggers in their hands.",

      "content": "Chapter 296: Family\nYe Luan wanted to break free from Jin Yang’s protection and run towards her. He shouted hoarsely, “Auntie Qiu, be careful!”\nJin Yang quickly pulled Ye Luan back. He stared intently at Qiu Tong as she fought with Bo Lang and the rest. “Don’t distract her!”\nThe modification drug had enhanced the various functions of her body to a terrifying level. She seemed to not feel any pain. Even if a dagger pierced into her arm, she could pull it out without blinking and use it to stab it back into the chest of her attacker.\nQiu Tong’s speed was more than three times that of an ordinary person. She flipped Bo Lang onto the ground and almost crushed him with her strength.\nShe wrapped the bomb that was tied to Ye Luan’s body around Bo Lang. When she saw the fear in his eyes, a bloodthirsty smile appeared on her lips. She picked up the remote control from the ground and ran back to the entrance of the pit.\nQiu Tong hugged Ye Luan and used her body to protect Jin Yang. The moment the three of them jumped into the pit, she pressed the remote control.\nThe violent explosion caused the building to shake violently a few times, and pungent smoke filled the air.\nShao An and the guards rushed over with tears in their eyes. When they saw Qiu Tong supporting Jin Yang and carrying Ye Luan out of the dust and smoke, they surrounded her excitedly. Qiu Tong leaned weakly against Jin Yang’s shoulder.\nShe turned around and looked at the collapsed building. She touched the top of Ye Luan’s head and said, “I’ve helped you take revenge.”\nYe Luan shed tears of guilt. Like an AI machine that had short-circuited, she spat out two mouthfuls of blood and swayed as she fell to the ground.\nJin Yang held her in his arms. Qiu Tong lifted her broken wrist with difficulty, her lips moving as if she wanted to say something.\nJin Yang hurriedly moved his ear closer and heard her whisper, “Tell Dad and Qiu Xingyuan…”\n“The effective duration of the modification drug is 45 minutes. Your body… will experience soreness and fractures. It cannot be used.”\nAfter that, Qiu Tong lost consciousness.\n…\nIn the villa, Qiu Rong and the children were gathered at the entrance of the surgery room.\nThe medical staff walked out with a heavy expression. Jin Yang anxiously asked about Qiu Tong’s condition, but the staff didn’t know how to answer.\n“Miss Qiu’s vital signs are stable. The superficial wounds caused by the fight are not serious. She will recover in half a month.”\n“But her mental state is currently in chaos. She is not reacting to external stimulation. I’ve been a doctor for decades, and I’ve never encountered such a situation, so I can’t make a judgment now. Miss Qiu’s condition is like being in a coma after taking a stimulant poison…”\nPoison? Qiu Rong and Jin Yang looked at each other. They knew that it was caused by the modification drug.\nWhen Ye Luan heard their conversation, he clenched his fists and ran to the top terrace. Two of his ribs were broken, and his body was covered in injuries.\nQiu Xingyuan sensed his emotions and followed him here.\nYe Luan turned to look at him and said in a very low voice, “I’m sorry. It’s all because of me that Auntie Qiu became like this.”\n“I received that message. If I had discussed it with you guys, this wouldn’t have happened…”\nQiu Xingyuan stood beside him and said with an exceptionally rational and calm expression, “Bo Lang and the members of the terrorist organization wanted revenge. Even if you escape this trap, there will still be a next time. And it might be me or Little Yu.”\n“If it were me, I wouldn’t be as strong as you.”\nYe Luan looked at Qiu Xingyuan fixedly. He didn’t expect Qiu Xingyuan, who usually looked at him coldly, to say such words.\nQiu Xingyuan seemed to sense his gaze as he turned around and walked towards the laboratory. He said indifferently, “You were in danger. It is natural for us to think of a way to save you. It’s Bo Lang’s fault that Mommy is unconscious, not yours. You don’t have to blame yourself and feel guilty.”\n“You… are our brother.”\nYe Luan couldn’t believe what he had just heard. He widened his eyes and took two steps forward. He moved his thin lips, wanting to confirm, but he didn’t dare to speak.\nQiu Xingyuan turned around. He picked up two bottles of chemicals and said seriously, “The most important thing now is to find a way to get rid of the toxins in Mommy’s body and develop a medicine that can wake her up. I need your help. Can you do that?”\nYe Luan was stunned for two seconds before nodding solemnly. He turned up the laboratory’s lights and started to work with him.\nAt this moment, Ye Luan felt like he had found the warmth of home again. It turned out that Qiu Xingyuan had already accepted him in his heart a long time ago. He was so stupid that he didn’t realize it. When Qiu Rong heard the commotion in the laboratory and saw two young but determined boys bustling about, he joined their efforts.\nJin Yang accompanied Qiu Tong in the room. Seeing her sleeping profile, he said softly, “I know you’re very tired. Have a good sleep.”\nShao An walked in after knocking on the door. He looked at Qiu Tong on the bed and reported softly, “Bo Lang’s remains were found at the scene. His arm and head exploded, and fragments of his body have been found. After testing the DNA, we can confirm that it’s him.”",

      "content": "Chapter 297: Wedding Ceremony\nLate at night, Qiu Tong was sleeping peacefully.\nQiu Xingqiao and Little Yu surrounded her bed and stared at her with swollen eyes. No matter how tired they were, they didn’t dare to close their eyes, afraid that if they looked away for a moment, the woman lying on the bed would stop breathing.\nThe usually noisy children had learned to be quiet and sensible at this moment. Qiu Xingyu would wipe her tears with the back of her hand from time to time.\nQiu Xingqiao said in a very low voice, “Mommy taught us not to cry no matter what happens.”\n“Crying won’t solve anything. It would only show others our cowardice…”\nQiu Xingyu choked back her sobs and tried to stop crying, but the more she thought about it, the more afraid she became. She threw herself into Qiu Xingqiao’s arms and said, “Second Brother, will Mommy never wake up again? Does she despise us for being noisy? She thinks that we’re disobedient, so she doesn’t want us anymore!”\nQiu Xingqiao raised his arm stiffly and pursed his lips stubbornly without saying a word.\nQiu Xingyuan walked to their side and quietly looked at Qiu Tong.\nIn the past, he had hated her. He had even tried his best to chase her away and make her die. But as time passed, Qiu Xingyuan could feel the love she had for him and his younger siblings. It was from the bottom of her heart, and it completely melted his heart.\nAlthough Qiu Xingyuan still maintained a remote relationship with her on the surface, he was gradually relying more and more on her in his heart.\nThe moment he learned that Qiu Tong had fallen into a coma, Qiu Xingyuan felt a deep sense of fear. He didn’t want to become a motherless child!\nQiu Xingyuan wiped Little Yu’s tears and said with certainty, “She just needs to rest. We have to wait obediently for her to wake up. We have to do things for her that she likes. She will naturally recover faster.”\nQiu Xingyu trusted Qiu Xingyuan the most. Hope lit up in her eyes.\nThe medical machines continued to beep.\nQiu Xingyu ran to the bed and gently massaged Qiu Tong’s arms and legs. She muttered, “I heard from Grandpa that a massage will speed up blood circulation. Mommy will ache from lying down all day. She’ll feel more comfortable this way.”\nWhen Qiu Xingqiao heard this, he joined in as well. Little Yu clumsily climbed onto the bed, avoiding the various tubes, and pressed her cold face against Qiu Tong’s chest. She listened to Qiu Tong’s steady heartbeat as she hummed a nursery rhyme, as if she was coaxing her to sleep…\nAt the door of the ward, Jin Yang quietly stood outside and watched the children’s actions. His heart ached.\nQiu Rong dragged his tired body out of the laboratory and followed Jin Yang’s line of sight to see the scene in the room.\nJin Yang turned around and looked at Qiu Rong when he heard the noise. Qiu Rong used his eyes to signal him to follow him to the balcony on the top floor. The sky was sparkling with a few bright stars, and a light wind blew. The dark circles under Jin Yang’s eyes indicated that he hadn’t slept for several days.\nQiu Rong hesitated for a moment before saying, “Qiu Tong used a semi-finished product. The ratio of the ingredients added to it is too violent for the human body to bear. When we were experimenting on the mice, they… didn’t survive.”\n“It was my mistake. I wanted to destroy the sample but I felt that it was the closest to the effect we wanted, so I decided to keep it overnight. I didn’t expect Tongtong to take it away and use it on herself.”\nQiu Rong rubbed his eyes. He had been trying his best to accept reality the past few days. He could not help feeling gloomy and solemn.\n“What I want to tell you is that Tongtong’s vital signs are normal now, but that doesn’t mean she can wake up.”\n“Even if she wakes up, no one can be certain what the drug has done to her body and whether her nervous system is irreversibly damaged. You are the president and Tongtong is my daughter…”\n“If she could talk, I know she would want you to continue your life.”\nQiu Rong hinted for Jin Yang to leave. He even thought of taking the children out of the villa and finding a secluded place to take care of them.\nHowever, just as he was about to speak, Jin Yang stopped him and said seriously, “Uncle Qiu, Qiu Tong and I have already completed the marriage procedures. She is my lawful wife.”\n“I won’t divorce her.”\nJin Yang’s thin lips curled into a faint smile. “I didn’t hold a wedding ceremony with her when we decided to get married. I hope you can allow me to hold a family wedding. I want to officially marry her and take care of her and the children as her husband.”\n“As you said, we don’t know if she can wake up again. I don’t want us to have any regrets.”\nJin Yang’s deep affection moved Qiu Rong. After a moment of silence, he nodded and said, “Up to you.”\nThe next morning, Shao An was shocked to receive the news, but he quickly started to organize the wedding ceremony.\nWhen Song Yan heard the news outside, he immediately rushed back to the villa. He forgot all the comforting words he had carefully planned on the way back. He just silently raised his hand and patted Jin Yang’s shoulder.\nJin Yang was dressed in a tuxedo. “You’re back at the right time. Welcome to my wedding.”",

The villa was filled with a festive red color.\nWith the help of the medical staff and maid, they managed to put Qiu Tong in an upright position in bed. She was wearing a specially customized white wedding dress. Her fluffy skirt trailed to the ground, and the floral design made her look beautiful and lively.\nThe maid put on some light makeup on Qiu Tong, making her look demure with her closed eyes and slight smile on her lips.\nQiu Xingyuan, Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu were all wearing formal attire. Under the gazes of the crowd, Jin Yang slowly walked to Qiu Tong and knelt on one knee. He took out the diamond ring that he had prepared and gently placed it on Qiu Tong’s ring finger. He then bent over and kissed the back of her hand.\nJin Yang looked up at Qiu Tong. He imagined that if she were awake, she would probably find the scene mushy and awkward.\nSong Yan and Shao An applauded and cheered. The atmosphere instantly became lively as everyone cried in joy.\nJin Yang said slowly in a hoarse voice, “My life before I met you was all black and white. I worked hard on government affairs and immersed myself in my career. I had no goals and didn’t know joy.”\n“Your appearance made me understand the beauty of life. It makes me look forward to every day from now on.”\n“Qiu Tong, I’m very glad that you chose to be my wife.”\nAccompanied by the music of the wedding march, the grand yet solemn atmosphere of the wedding ended. Jin Yang planted a light kiss on Qiu Tong’s forehead, his palm pressed against hers. It was exceptionally warm.\n…\nAt the Liqing Corporation’s office building, the helicopter landed steadily on the helipad at the top floor.\nA white-haired old man was escorted by many bodyguards to the General Manager’s office.\nYu Ge was about to greet him when he raised his hand and slapped Yu Ge’s left cheek. Yu Ge staggered, feeling dizzy. His eyes were filled with doubt as he said, “Dad?”\nThe old man was the founder of the Liqing Corporation. He rushed over when he heard the news of Bo Lang’s death.\nTerrence narrated the situation to him from the side. The old man’s face darkened as he said in a loud voice, “The deployment of S City is centered on Bo Lang. He was leading hundreds of members, including many whom only he knows how to contact!”\n“Because of your reckless and brainless plan, we lost hundreds of members for nothing.”\n“The Vulture Organization’s communication network in S City has been severely damaged and everything is at a standstill. Do you know what you’ve done?”\nYu Ge tugged at his tie impatiently. Taking advantage of the fact that he was the old man’s biological son, he said arrogantly, “Only a few hundred people died. Send some more from outside the country, or recruit new men. What’s the big deal…”\nThump! The old man kicked Yu Ge hard in the stomach. But after seeing Yu Ge was kneeling on the ground, the old man’s eyes flashed with heartache.\nTerrence watched everything from the sidelines. The old man waved at him and said, “Go out first. I have something to tell him alone.”\nYu Ge supported himself against the desk and stood up in pain. He was about to question the old man’s actions.\nThe old man beat him to it. He said in a helpless tone, “Do you think I own both the Liqing Corporation and the Vulture Organization?”\nYu Ge widened his eyes in confusion and asked, “What then?”\nThe old man chuckled. “I did build the Liqing Corporation myself, but five years ago, I nearly went bankrupt due to poor management. Fortunately, someone invested a huge sum of money in me so that I could make a comeback.”\n“His only request is the Liqing Corporation to be the white glove of the Vulture Organization, to be their legitimate front.”\n“At the end of the day, that man is the biggest boss of the Liqing Corporation and Vulture Organization, not me! Your actions have already angered him. Terrence is his trusted aide. I have to punish you in front of Terrence before he will let you off, understand?”\nYu Ge did not know how to react.\nHe recalled Terrence’s abnormal actions and couldn’t help feeling shocked.\nYu Ge looked at the commotion in the corridor outside and asked in a low voice, “Why did he allow me to attack Qiu Tong and not stop me?”\nThe old man frowned and said, “It might be because they want to use this opportunity to take control of the Liqing Corporation.”\n“Your rashness caused the corporation to suffer losses of billions of dollars. This morning, the foreign board of directors decided to confiscate the portion of shares I left you. In other words, we no longer have any control and management rights over the Liqing Corporation in S City.”\nYu Ge was lost in thought for a long time. Terrence knocked on the glass door and walked in with a devilish smile on his face.\nTerrence nudged his gold-framed glasses and nodded at the old man and Yu Ge. “Your hotel has been prepared. Please leave with the car. You are not needed here anymore…” Before Terrence could finish his sentence, Yu Ge rushed over and gripped his collar tightly.\nYu Ge gritted his teeth and questioned, “This is all part of your plan, right?”\nTerrence pried his fingers away, his eyes flashing with disgust. “You’re the stupid one. You can’t blame anyone else.”\n“I also want to thank you for helping me get rid of my long-standing opponent. I will find a way to repay you…”",

      "content": "Chapter 299: Testing The Antidote\nIn the laboratory on the top floor, the two different chemicals spun and collided crazily on the instrument panel, finally fusing into a dark purple liquid.\nQiu Xingyuan and Ye Luan did not blink as they stared at the entire concoction process. They could not help letting out low cries of joy.\nThey high-fived and hugged each other. The dark purple liquid meant that they had successfully tested an antidote that could stimulate the nervous system and neutralize the semi-finished modification drug!\nThe joy quickly faded. Qiu Xingyuan and Ye Luan reached out their hands at almost the same time, wanting to snatch the antidote.\nQiu Xingyuan grabbed the tube first. With his back facing Ye Luan, he pushed a syringe into the test tube.\nYe Luan stopped him with a solemn expression. “You’re Auntie Qiu’s son. Let me try…”\nQiu Xingyuan frowned and retorted, “I was the one who came up with the composition of this antidote. No one is more suitable than me. You are older than me. If anything happens, you have to take care of Xingqiao and Little Yu.”\n“Especially Xingqiao. He may always make sarcastic remarks at you, but deep down inside, he admires you.”\nThe two children were very similar to Jin Yang and Qiu Tong. As they fought over the antidote, a pair of large hands descended from above and took away the test tube.\nQiu Xingyuan and Ye Luan lifted their heads in shock.\nJin Yang raised the syringe and tried to inject it into his body.\nYe Luan hurriedly jumped up and pressed down on his arm, shouting, “No! There’s a problem with this antidote!”\nThe argument in the laboratory woke everyone in the villa. Everyone gathered in the living room, all staring at the antidote.\nQiu Xingyuan clasped his hands and explained, “Although we specially made this antidote for the semi-finished modification drug, there are two components that Ye Luan and I are not sure about.”\n“This version of the antidote might wake Mommy up or kill her.”\n“But if this version doesn’t work, then the other one will definitely succeed.”\nEveryone was silent. Qiu Xingyuan’s intention was undoubtedly to gamble with his life, betting on a 50% chance.\nQiu Xingyu asked with tears in her eyes, “Is that why Eldest Brother wants to test the antidote in place of Mommy?”\nQiu Xingyuan paused for a moment before nodding gently. An opportunity was right in front of him. Even if he had to use his life to try, he was willing!\nJin Yang held the test tube in his hand. He said without hesitation, “I should be the one testing it.”\nSong Yan suddenly stood up, his eyes filled with confusion and anger. He asked, “There are so many death row inmates in the prison. Shao An can find any two and experiment on them! They are already destined for death, but what about you? What if something happens to you?”\n“The capital will be paralyzed. What will the high-ranking officials of the various cities secretly do? Your beloved citizens might end up in a civil war!”\n“You are usually so responsible and noble. Why are you so impulsive now? Put down the antidote!”\nShao An nodded in agreement and gestured to send someone to the prison to ask for subjects.\nJin Yang stopped them and said in a low voice, “It’s not safe in S City’s prison. Have you forgotten that the prison guards tried to kill Uncle Qiu? Can you guarantee that you can find a death row inmate and not a killer from the Vulture Organization?”\n“The guards have suffered heavy losses. The entire villa is being guarded by less than 10 of them, as well as Ke Le and his men. We cannot withstand another attack, Song Yan, how can I risk everyone’s safety?”\nSong Yan understood that his worries were reasonable, but he insisted and used the well-being of the citizens to pressure Jin Yang.\nJin Yang smirked, his eyes filled with trust as he said, “Haven’t you always wanted to be the president? Now, such a good opportunity is right in front of you. If something really happens to me, Shao An will obey you.”\n“You are not like me. You will not be controlled by our father. Perhaps you can make a new world.”\nWith that, Jin Yang injected the antidote into his body.\nThe effects of the antidote spread throughout his body. Jin Yang lost his balance and fell to the ground. Qiu Xingyuan ran to his side and helped him lean against the back of the sofa, allowing him to breathe more comfortably.\nShao An wanted to bring him to the ward on the top floor, but Qiu Xingyuan stopped him with bloodshot eyes. “No!”\n“Moving him will disrupt the antidote in his body. All we can do is wait…”\nOver the past few days, the Qiu family had endured many desperate situations. Each of them had an expression of deep helplessness on their faces.\nThey thought that their hearts were already numb to death, but it still hurt.\nJin Yang’s face turned pale and ashen. He could feel the alternating heat and chill coming from his body.\nJin Yang’s body kept twitching and trembling until he lost consciousness.\nWarm sunlight shone on his body. After an unknown period of time, Jin Yang slowly opened his eyes. He saw Qiu Xingyuan sleeping beside him and gently touched him. Qiu Xingyuan was instantly awakened and he immediately checked the monitor equipment.\n“You’re awake. The antidote is successful!”\nQiu Xingyuan said excitedly. Jin Yang stroked his head and nodded.",

      "content": "Chapter 300: A Storm Overseas\nFive days later, Qiu Tong opened her eyes.\nShe felt a dull pain in her bones as if they had been shattered and reformed.\nQiu Tong wanted to move her numb arms, but she ended up making contact with a tiny head.\nQiu Xingyu rubbed her eyes and opened them, yawning. When she saw Qiu Tong had awoken, she jumped up in excitement and bumped into Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao, who were lying beside her. The noise of the children woke Jin Yang and the others on the ground. They all stood up and surrounded the bed.\nQiu Tong did not expect the room to hold so many people!\nQiu Xingyu said in a choked voice, “Mommy, why are you only awake now? Eldest Brother said you should have woken up three days ago!”\nQiu Xingyuan and Ye Luan ran over to examine Qiu Tong’s body. They explained, “Perhaps the modification drug has been in Mommy’s body for too long, some components have merged with her blood and will take more time to be completely removed.”\n“How are you feeling now?”\nQiu Xingqiao took the initiative to help her sit up. Such treatment surprised Qiu Tong.\nQiu Rong’s figure was hunched. He seemed to have aged five or six years over the past few days. He chased the children back to their rooms to have a good rest. Taking advantage of the quiet time, he told Qiu Tong about everything that had happened recently.\nQiu Tong looked down at the ring on her ring finger and grumbled with a smile, “What a cunning fellow.”\n“You specially chose a time when I can’t reject you, right?”\nQiu Tong’s body was still weak. She would cough violently after saying a few words. Jin Yang sat beside her with a bowl of ginseng soup that he had personally brewed. He accepted all her complaints and thoughtfully scooped up a spoonful of soup. He blew at it until it was cooler before bringing it to Qiu Tong’s lips.\nJin Yang stared at her features, still feeling like he was in a dream.\nQiu Tong was touched by what Jin Yang had done for her. A wicked smile appeared on her face.\nJin Yang saw her red lips and understood her intentions. He smiled helplessly and kissed her.\nQiu Tong hooked her arms around his neck. Their intense movements accidentally tugged at her IV needle. She cried out softly, “It hurts!”\nJin Yang moved more gently and met her crafty eyes. He kissed her eyebrows.\nKnock, knock, knock. Shao An, who had returned from outside, knocked on the door. By the time he saw the scene of Jin Yang and Qiu Tong kissing on the bed, it was already too late for him to back out. Shao An could only straighten his back and stare at the ceiling. His voice was filled with apology as he said, “Sir, I didn’t see anything!”\nQiu Tong pushed Jin Yang away with a chuckle, while Jin Yang said with dissatisfaction and anger, “You better have something important.”\nShao An straightened his back and respectfully handed over the documents in his hand. “Important information. Our team members outside the borders have sent back news that the Liqing Corporation’s headquarters has convened a board meeting to remove Yu Ge’s management rights in S City.”\n“A few days ago, our men discovered that a helicopter landed on the roof of the Liqing Corporation branch office in S City. It’s suspected to be Yu Ge’s father.”\nJin Yang frowned as he flipped through the documents. Qiu Tong rested her chin on his shoulder and leaned over to look. Jin Yang noticed her actions and thoughtfully shifted the documents so that she could read better. He gestured for Shao An to continue.\nShao An shifted his gaze elsewhere. “We secretly followed Terrence and Yu Ge and discovered that Yu Ge and his father have not appeared for many days.”\n“They must have been placed under house arrest at a hotel downtown. There are a few members of the Vulture Organization guarding the perimeter of the hotel.”\n“All the armed forces in S City have been handed over to Terrence. Overseas news of the Liqing Corporation was cut off three days ago. It’s speculated that our men were discovered and their whereabouts are currently unknown. The Liqing Corporation has also publicly announced that they are reorganizing and are quickly amassing funds.”\nThe same thought appeared in Jin Yang and Qiu Tong’s minds. They had begun to take action…\nJin Yang gestured for Shao An to rest for the time being and wait for his orders. Qiu Tong held Jin Yang’s slender fingers as she fell into deep thought, playing with them subconsciously. “It looks like their focus is overseas. Yu Ge and his father are just pawns who were used. Yu Ge’s actions disrupted their plans, which is why they were placed under house arrest.”\nThe modification drug had been tested on her. From the remains of the communication device Shao An had found at the scene, it was very likely that Terrence had witnessed the entire process that day. They would definitely work hard to snatch Qiu Rong and the drug.\nInstead of waiting for them to come knocking, why not…\nQiu Tong stared at Jin Yang sharply and suggested, “Let’s go find them overseas!”\n“They definitely won’t expect us to dare to come to their territory. Only by doing so can we disrupt all our plans and have a chance of winning. The more we wait here passively, the more dangerous it will be.”\nJin Yang’s thoughts were the same as hers, but he was worried about Qiu Tong’s health.\nQiu Tong understood his concerns and cupped his handsome face in her hands. “Let Qiu Xingyuan do a full body examination on me. If he agrees I am well enough, we’ll leave, okay?”",

      "content": "Chapter 301: Puppet Boss\nOutside the borders, Qiu Tong and Jin Yang arrived at the airport in a helicopter. They quickly went to the secret base to rest.\nJin Yang ordered Shao An to instruct all their guards and spies hidden overseas to find clues about the Vulture Organization.\nLate at night, Qiu Tong stood in front of the French windows of the villa in her pajamas. Her back profile looked a little lonely and worried.\nJin Yang came out of the study and hugged her soft waist from behind. He rested his chin on her shoulder and said in a low voice, “All the spies connected to the Liqing Corporation have been cut off. We can’t find out anything about the Vulture Organization.”\n“Together with Shao An, I’ll go to the headquarters of the Liqing Corporation tomorrow as a potential collaborator and see if I can find any clues.”\nQiu Tong’s eyes were instantly filled with worry and anxiety. The enemy they were facing was hiding in the dark and they did not know anything about them.\n“I’ll go with you.”\nJin Yang wanted to refuse at first, but he thought of Qiu Tong’s character. He finally nodded in agreement.\nThe next day at the Liqing Corporation headquarters, the CEO’s secretary stood at the door to welcome them with a smile and brought them into the guest room.\nQiu Tong examined the decor and layout of the corridor and vaguely felt that something was wrong.\nIn the guest room, a mixed-race man dressed in a suit was sitting on a leather sofa. When he saw Jin Yang, he smiled brightly and reached out to shake his hand. “I’ve long heard of your great name, Mr. Jin Yang. It’s the company’s honor that you came.”\n“The Liqing Corporation’s branch in S City is very outstanding. I want to discuss the possibility of collaborating with you.”\nAs Jin Yang’s female companion, Qiu Tong sat quietly beside him, staring at the mixed-race man with a sharp glint in her eyes. Perhaps it was because her gaze was too purposeful, but it made the other party turn his head from time to time. Every now and then, he would pick up a glass cup from his desk and take a sip of tea.\nJin Yang tapped his finger on the glass panel on the table and asked with a smile, “Are you Liqing Corporation’s boss?”\n“Why? Mr. Jin Yang doesn’t think I look like a boss?”\nThe mixed-race man was quick to reply. Jin Yang shook his head slightly, his attitude perfunctory.\nThe two of them only stayed at the Liqing Corporation headquarters for about half an hour before bidding farewell and leaving. They boarded the black vehicle parked in the underground parking lot. The moment the door closed, Shao An immediately gestured for the driver to drive away. He turned around and asked nervously, “Sir, how was it?”\n“He’s definitely not the boss.”\nQiu Tong spoke firmly. Jin Yang had the same opinion.\n“When he was talking to you, he tried his best to appear calm and collected, but his instinctive swallowing and evasive eyes betrayed the nervousness in his heart. He could answer all your questions about the Liqing Corporation within two seconds, as if he didn’t need to think at all.”\n“A normal person would need time to think and respond when faced with questions, but he seems to have memorized the answers to the questions in advance.”\n“It is as if he was a pre-programmed robot. There must be something wrong with him. He’s the scapegoat who is being offered to the altar.”\nQiu Tong frowned and stared at Jin Yang. It seemed like their hidden opponent was more cautious and cunning than they had imagined.\nShao An could tell the seriousness of the problem. He suddenly thought of a few suspicious points mentioned by a spy who had come to the villa to report. He said loudly, “Sir, before our spy lost contact with us, he sent us a topographic map. After investigating, we can confirm that it’s the topographic map of the Liqing Corporation’s headquarters. And the location of the red dot on the map is on the CEO level.”\n“From the public information we have now, there’s no such space on the CEO level at that red dot.”\nJin Yang took the blueprint and rubbed the red dot with his slender index finger. He muttered softly, “Hidden room?”\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes. “I’ll scout out the place tonight and see if I can open the secret room and find some clues. I’ve taken note of the security guards’ route and the exact location of the surveillance cameras. I can let Little Yu operate them remotely and help me temporarily shut off their system.”\n“No, it’s dangerous.”\nJin Yang refused decisively, but Qiu Tong insisted, “We’re pressed for time. We have to take the risk and find their weak point.”\n“You have a lot of men under your orders. You can’t go. I’m your wife, so I’ll take your place.”\nQiu Tong stared at Jin Yang’s determined and deep eyes. Jin Yang’s heart skipped a beat. He couldn’t control his emotions and raised his hand to grab the back of Qiu Tong’s head. He pulled her into his arms and leaned over to kiss her soft and delicate lips.\nShao An immediately averted his gaze and raised the partition.\nQiu Tong hooked her arms around Jin Yang’s neck and deepened the kiss. Their breaths mixed together, and Jin Yang seemed to want to melt the woman in his arms. It was only when the tip of his tongue felt a sweet taste that they parted reluctantly.\n“Come back safely!”\nJin Yang stroked the top of Qiu Tong’s messy hair and said in a low voice.\nQiu Tong smiled and smoothed the crease between his brows with her fingers. All their emotions were communicated without need for words.",

      "content": "Chapter 302: Realistic Nightmare\nLate at night, thick clouds blocked out the moonlight.\nQiu Tong bent over and took out a dagger from her boot and held it in front of her. She looked at her surroundings warily and carefully circled around the security booth to the corner behind the Liqing Corporation. Qiu Tong picked up the curved hook she carried with her and flicked it twice.\nThe eight-clawed hook accurately hooked onto a drainage pipe. Qiu Tong pulled hard and nimbly climbed up.\nHer figure was light and graceful, pressing against the wall like a lizard in the dark night.\nQiu Tong arrived at the air conditioner on the middle floor and took a breather.\nShe lowered her head and glanced at the ground, which was more than 10 meters high. There was no fear or nervousness in her eyes. Instead, there was a hint of disdain. A cold wind blew over and the rope swayed. It made one’s heart skip a beat.\nQiu Tong waited for the other security guards to leave before climbing to the top floor in two minutes.\nShe used a dagger to pry open a crack in the window. She took out two grains of sand from her bag and threw them to the ground. After confirming that there were no other anti-theft devices, she jumped down.\nQiu Tong patted the dust off her palm and looked around the CEO office of the Liqing Corporation for clues.\nIt was a little different from when she came earlier in the day. Qiu Tong noticed that the Picasso painting hanging on the wall had been changed to another one. The painting’s abstract eyes looked a little strange and terrifying under the moonlight.\nShe slowly approached as if she was subconsciously attracted to him. She raised her hand and searched the canvas.\nKacha! When Qiu Tong’s fingers touched the eyeball in the portrait, the sound of a mechanism being activated could be heard.\nShe turned around warily and watched as the walls opened to the sides, revealing an independent secret room.\n“Looks like this should be the hidden space Shao An mentioned…”\nQiu Tong muttered to herself as she walked in to check. She realized that there were two blinking computers in the empty secret room. She would need a password to unlock them.\n“Go and investigate Jin Yang’s whereabouts. It’s best if you can create trouble for them and chase them away.”\n“I don’t want them to discover too many of the corporation’s secrets, understand?”\nThe mixed-race man’s voice came from the corridor.\nQiu Tong hid behind a curtain nervously. She could hear her heart beating as she maintained her stance, ready to attack at any moment. She swallowed silently, confirming the enemy’s location through the faint light from the curtain.\n“I think I left something in the parking lot. Go get it for me.”\nThe mixed-race man stopped at the door and instructed his assistant.\nInstead of entering the office, he went to the bathroom.\nQiu Tong took the opportunity to leave through the window. She used the zipline to descend to the bottom of the building and quickly disappeared into the darkness.\nIn the villa, Jin Yang heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that she had returned safely.\nQiu Tong told Jin Yang what she had found. “I think evidence of the Liqing Corporation’s misdeeds and the experimental drug they are developing are all in that secret room. They will be trying to chase us off soon. We need to act before they do anything.”\n“I’ll lead a team to attack the Liqing Corporation tomorrow.”\nJin Yang made his decision. Qiu Tong nodded in agreement and requested to join the attack team.\nAt dawn, Qiu Tong had a very realistic nightmare in Jin Yang’s arms. She dreamed that she was standing at the edge of the cliff, with Jin Yang’s broad and straight back in front of her. The whistling wind brushed past her ears.\nQiu Tong vaguely saw a familiar figure standing in the light opposite her, but she could not hear the contents of his conversation with Jin Yang.\nBang… With a violent explosion, Qiu Tong felt a surge of warmth spread out before her eyes. Jin Yang’s figure slowly fell to the ground. She was in so much pain that she couldn’t breathe as she shouted loudly. It was only when Jin Yang shook her shoulder that she woke up from the nightmare.\n“Did you have a nightmare?”\nJin Yang gently wiped the cold sweat off her forehead. “Don’t be afraid. It might be because of the change in the environment that made you so tense.”\nQiu Tong’s palms were covered in sweat. A voice in her mind kept reminding her that she seemed to have forgotten something.\nThis uneasy feeling made her desperate to absorb Jin Yang’s warmth. Qiu Tong pressed Jin Yang’s shoulders down and threw the thin silk blanket to the side. She lifted her silk sleeping robe and straddled Jin Yang’s waist, kissing him without a word.\nJin Yang sensed her desire and placed his palm on her slender waist, stroking upwards.\nHis fingertips gently traced Qiu Tong’s chest before he cupped her soft and plump breasts with his hands.\nQiu Tong’s body went limp as she laid on Jin Yang’s chest. His hot breath sprayed on her delicate neck, causing her body to tremble uncontrollably. When she closed her eyes, she would remember the scene in her dream. Her muscles tensed as she straightened her slender waist.\n“Mmm…”\nJin Yang grunted. His eyes flickered with surprise when he saw Qiu Tong’s actions.\nQiu Tong slipped him inside her.\nJin Yang gritted his teeth and flipped over to press her down. The two of them hugged each other in the bedroom. The beautiful and ambiguous atmosphere lasted until the sun rose. The room was filled with the scent of love.",

      "content": "Chapter 303: Deep Into The Secret Room\nIt was evening and two hours before the operation began.\nJin Yang assigned a mission to Shao An in the courtyard of the villa. Qiu Tong came out of the room rubbing her eyes. Through the misty glass, she saw that Shao An was a little agitated, as if he was objecting to Jin Yang’s orders. Jin Yang’s expression did not change. His cold profile was void of any emotion. His thin lips moved as he continued. Shao An’s eyes turned red, and he finally nodded heavily.\n“…You have to ensure Qiu Tong’s safety and the children’s.”\nQiu Tong pushed the door open and vaguely heard these words. She looked at Jin Yang in confusion.\nJin Yang glared at Shao An. Shao An immediately turned around and wiped the tears from the corners of his eyes. He nodded at Qiu Tong and left.\nQiu Tong wanted to ask what they were talking about, but Jin Yang gently rubbed the top of her head. He asked her to turn around with a smile in his voice. As if performing a magic trick, he took out a velvet jewelry box and took out a sparkling necklace. He placed it around her neck.\n“I’ve prepared this a long time ago and planned all sorts of occasions to present it to you. Since you were so enthusiastic about me last night, I might as well give it to you now.”\n“I polished this necklace myself. The workmanship is not that great but it is full of meaning.”\nJin Yang rubbed Qiu Tong’s collarbone with his fingers, muttering longingly, “It looks good on you. Promise me you won’t remove it, okay?”\nQiu Tong felt that there was a hint of sadness in his words and felt increasingly uneasy.\nShao An broke the atmosphere when he appeared and said in a hoarse voice, “Sir, all the guards are ready. We can set off at any time.”\n“Let’s set off now.”\nJin Yang restrained the emotion in his eyes and resumed his cold-blooded and stern expression. He held Qiu Tong’s hand and headed towards the Liqing Corporation.\nThe president’s guards were all well-trained. When the convoy arrived near the Liqing Corporation, it only took them half an hour to control the Vulture Organization’s men at the periphery.\nJin Yang and Qiu Tong easily entered the top floor. They pressed the button to open the secret room.\nShao An stood guard outside. Qiu Tong and Jin Yang rummaged through the bookcase in the secret room, wanting to find the Vulture Organization’s top-secret documents.\nWith a loud bang, a wall suddenly rose from the secret room, isolating the interior and exterior, trapping Jin Yang and Qiu Tong inside.\nJin Yang shielded Qiu Tong.\n“Long time no see, Mr. Jin Yang. What are you looking for? Barging into my room like this?”\nThe electric-like voice echoed in the secret room in a strange manner. Qiu Tong immediately understood where the uncomfortable feeling in her heart came from. Everything had gone too smoothly! Ever since they met the mixed-race man, everything had been progressing to plan. It was as if an invisible hand was guiding them step by step into his trap.\nQiu Tong frowned and tried her best to calm down. She said sarcastically, “What’s the point of hiding in the dark?”\n“Since we’re already trapped here by you, why don’t you come out and have a chat with us?”\nThe voice paused for a moment before asking in an amused tone, “What do you want to chat about?”\n“Your evil behavior, your Vulture Organization has harmed many innocent people. You used your business as a cover to expand your territory, selling weapons and drugs, and researching the human modification drug…”\n“You have to pay for what you did.”\nQiu Tong’s tone was firm. But the voice replied perfunctorily, “Miss Qiu, you’re too naive!”\n“Your father developed the human modification drug. I just wanted to expand the production to benefit more people. What’s wrong with that? I sold weapons to those who needed to protect themselves so that they didn’t have to depend on others. They are all good deeds.”\n“How many people has the Vulture Organization and Liqing Corporation helped over the years? I believe Jin Yang knows.”\nQiu Tong was speechless at the person’s shamelessness.\nThe person hiding in the dark thought of himself as a God who could save the world, but in reality, he was manipulating people. He was trying to become a God, looking down on everything, making the world spin according to his mood.\nSuch arrogance made Qiu Tong furious.\nHowever, Jin Yang remained silent. He quietly stared at the display screens of the two computers and suddenly smiled.\n“In that case, why did you want me to be the president? Wouldn’t it have been better for you to be the president from the start?”\nHis words stunned Qiu Tong. Her blood seemed to flow in reverse. Her limbs were cold and she trembled uncontrollably. Jin Yang’s eyes were filled with shattered calm as he questioned the voice. It was as if he had long guessed that this would happen today.\n“What are you talking about? Jin Yang!”\nQiu Tong tugged at Jin Yang’s sleeve, wanting to reject her own conjecture, but the thoughts in her mind gradually became clearer.\nAll the scattered fragments pieced together to form a complete picture. The picture displayed was cold and terrifying.\nCreak…\nThe secret doors on all sides opened and many masked men rushed out. They had guns and restrained Jin Yang and Qiu Tong.",

      "content": "Chapter 304: It’s Actually Him\nThe rumbling thunder tore through the silent night, as if tearing a rift in the sky.\nThe bookcase in the secret room opened from the middle. Terrence supported the man beside him respectfully.\nAlthough he was wearing a silver mask and his face could not be seen clearly, Qiu Tong felt a strong sense of familiarity from him.\nJin Yang and Qiu Tong’s hands were tied up. The ropes were made of special materials and the more they struggled, the tighter it became.\nAfter trying a few times, Qiu Tong panted heavily, her cells all highly vigilant as she searched for an opening.\nThe masked man sensed her hostility and chuckled nonchalantly. He said arrogantly, “Even if I let you go, you won’t be able to escape from the Liqing Corporation’s headquarters. There are countless traps and mechanisms hidden in this building…”\n“Since we’re in your hands now, take off your mask.”\nJin Yang’s thin lips curled into a mocking smile as a self-deprecating glint flashed across his eyes. He forced out a word. “Dad.”\nQiu Tong’s throat felt like it was being strangled by an invisible hand. She couldn’t make a sound.\nThe masked man calmly took off the silver mask covering his face. A familiar face gradually appeared.\nJin Tao! It was him?!\nThe president’s father was actually the founder of this evil corporation?!\nQiu Tong’s heart suddenly constricted. Meanwhile, Jin Tao stared at Jin Yang with interest and asked, “When did you know?”\n“When the Vulture Organization infiltrated the country, I felt that something was wrong.”\nJin Yang’s eyes turned bloodshot. Now that all his speculations were confirmed, he did not feel as relieved as he had imagined. Instead, his heart felt increasingly heavy and powerless. The enemy he had been pursuing for a long time was actually his family. This powerful realization made him smile bitterly.\n“Ever since I took office, management of the underground black market has been extremely strict.”\n“You once taught me that there will never be absolute black and white. Only by allowing the existence of gray areas can we maintain order better. I listened to your teachings and opened up the black market. I also tacitly allowed them to conduct small-scale arms trafficking and hire criminals… I also didn’t close off the Dark Web.”\n“But everything that happened in these places is under my control. Many traffickers can only do business with my permission. Many years ago, the Vulture Organization marched into the underground black market in a domineering manner, bearing weapons that only the military has.”\nAs Jin Yang recalled the past, his deep voice did not waver even for a moment.\n“At that time, I suspected that they had a high-ranking government official backing them, but I didn’t suspect you.”\n“You’ve been living in the old residence the entire time. It seems like you’ve given me authority, but all the confidential documents are in your hands. I don’t even have the authority to transfer them. I noticed this when I was investigating the human modification drug, so I deliberately probed you…”\nJin Yang had secretly done many things, but Jin Tao was too conceited and did not care.\n“I could almost confirm that you are the mastermind behind this, but before entering this secret room, I still had a ridiculous hope that I was wrong. The incense in this secret room is your favorite scent. It’s very difficult to obtain. Only the old residence still has a few boxes of it.”\n“When Qiu Tong and I first came to this office, your mixed-race puppet revealed many flaws.”\n“And I realized that the keyboard on the desk is slanted. The mouse, screen and keyboard are arranged in a certain subtle angle, as per your unique habit.”\n“There’s a thin red string hanging from the leaf of the potted plant on the window sill. This is also your habit.”\nJin Yang’s gaze landed on Jin Tao. His familiarity with his father was his confirmation.\n“Hahaha…”\nJin Tao laughed heartily. He couldn’t help clapping his hands and praising, “You’re indeed my son. You’re very outstanding.”\nQiu Tong narrowed her eyes. She saw Jin Yang’s fingers rubbing his palm and guessed that he had made arrangements in advance. She tacitly helped him stall for time and asked, “Why did you obtain the human modification drug? Why did you create a terrorist organization?”\n“You’ve already obtained power and a life that ordinary people envy! What else are you not satisfied with?”\nJin Tao grinned when he heard her words. He raised his index finger and poked his chest, replying decisively, “I am greedy.”\n“Everyone wants a greater authority. I can be the president in this country, but what about overseas? What about the world?”\n“What I want is for everyone to submit to me and beg for my favor! I want to use the modification drug to create an army so powerful that no one can defeat it. This mutant army will fulfill my dream of ruling the world!”\n“I was just one step away from success, but your father disrupted everything!”\nJin Tao’s eyes flickered with madness as he glared at Qiu Tong. “This so-called scientist tried to escape with his secret. How ridiculous!”",

      "content": "Chapter 305: Counterattack\n“Many years ago, I gathered Qiu Rong and the other scientists to develop a drug for me. The initial progress was very smooth.”\n“Qiu Rong is a genius in the field of biochemistry. He can accurately adjust the ratio of the drug. In three months, I obtained the first experimental drug. The results of human experiments show that it can increase a portion of the body’s functions, but it will cause irreversible damage, leading to the death of the human subject.”\nFanaticism and ruthlessness flashed across Jin Tao’s eyes. He gritted his teeth and slammed his fist on the desk.\n“I urged Qiu Rong to improve the ratio of the drug as soon as possible, but he argued with me.”\nQiu Rong believed that the drug cannot be tested on humans. It was too cruel and immoral.\nIn order to achieve his goal, Jin Tao rejected Qiu Rong’s opinion. He continued to choose soldiers from the army for the experiments. In just half a month, dozens of guards had died from the side effects of the drug.\nQiu Rong gradually realized that Jin Tao’s goal was not as benevolent as he claimed. He slowed down his research.\n“Your father was as stupid as you. He tried to convince me…”\nJin Tao recalled what had happened that night. It was an electrifying exchange. Qiu Rong tugged at his collar and shouted angrily. “You have no right to harm anyone! Your actions are murder. You have to suffer the legal consequences!”\nQiu Tong frowned tightly, as if she could see what had happened back then. Her heart hung in suspense as Jin Tao narrated.\n“I calmed Qiu Rong down and pretended to agree with his opinion to stop the experiments.”\n“But he was smarter than I thought. He didn’t believe me. Instead, he took the opportunity to destroy all the relevant information in the laboratory and secretly helped one of the laboratory staff escape with the chip. By the time I discovered it, it was already too late!”\nJin Tao’s eyes were filled with hatred. If Qiu Rong had not meddled in this matter, he would have already ruled the world!\nQiu Tong and Jin Yang looked at each other and guessed that the researcher who fled with the chip was Ye Luan’s father…\nJin Tao took a deep breath to calm himself.\nTerrence lit a cigar and handed it to him. He took a puff and blew out a thick cloud of smoke.\n“Qiu Rong thinks he knows all the secrets of the modification drug so I can’t do anything to him.”\n“That’s right. I can’t kill him. That’s why I sent people to detain him. I’ve planted many spies in the prison and used all sorts of methods to entice Qiu Rong to reveal his secret. But he’s like a mute. He hasn’t revealed any information to me all these years!”\n“Until you showed up…”\nJin Tao raised his hand and pointed at Qiu Tong. Kinship was Qiu Rong’s weak spot and a lethal weapon which Jin Tao could use.\nQiu Tong suddenly understood everything that had happened. She frowned and asked, “You were the one who arranged the prison assassination!”\n“Of course, I was the one who helped you to bail him out.”\nJin Tao nodded approvingly. “You all thought that you were safe and continued to develop the drug without worry. Little did you know that I have been secretly watching your every move, waiting for the day the drug would succeed! Bo Lang’s death was also deliberately planned by me. My goal was to see if the drug succeeded.”\nThe man in front of her could be described as terrifying.\nJin Tao’s every move was precisely calculated according to what he predicted they would do. Making use of Qiu Rong and Qiu Tong’s personalities, he designed countless traps for them to jump into. Qiu Tong recalled all sorts of things in the past and realized that many of her actions had been quietly guided along. A chill ran from the bottom of her heart and spread through her blood. This was the first time she felt afraid.\nJin Yang remained silent, as if waiting for someone.\nTime ticked by. With a loud bang, the door to the secret room slammed open from the outside. Shao An stood outside with the president’s guards carrying rocket launchers. Jin Tao’s men did not dare to move.\n“Sir! The people outside have been restrained. Two or three of them have escaped and we have sent men to chase after them.”\nShao An ran to Jin Yang’s side and quickly untied him.\nJin Yang rotated his wrists and untied Qiu Tong, pulling her to his side to protect her.\nJin Tao did not expect this to happen. “Did you get captured on purpose?”\n“Father, you taught me a lot of things, including the way you think. After confirming that you’re the boss behind the Liqing Corporation, I knew very well that this building was a trap for me, so I pretended not to notice and let Shao An handle your minions outside.”\n“You’re too arrogant. You won’t communicate with your men outside during the time I’m in your hands. You’re too confident that you will succeed in the end.”\nJin Yang stood tall and straight in front of Jin Tao. His eyes burned as he said in a low voice, “That became the key to breaking out of your trap!”\nQiu Tong heard her heart thumping. She took two submachine guns from Shao An’s hands and stared at Jin Tao warily. Her instinct told her that things were not that simple!\nJin Tao took out his gun and was about to pull the trigger when he realized that there were no bullets in the barrel!",

      "content": "Chapter 306: Reversal\n“It’s you?!”\nIn an instant, Shao An led the guards to restrain Jin Tao and Terrence.\nThe butler in the corner slowly walked out of the shadows and came to Jin Yang’s side.\nJin Tao gritted his teeth and shouted angrily, his tone filled with reluctance. “Why did you betray me!”\n“When did you start being under Jin Yang?”\nA conflicted and guilty expression flashed across the butler’s weathered face. Jin Yang understood that it was not easy for him to admit to betrayal. The butler had been by Jin Tao’s side from the time when Jin Tao was just a youth. He had taken care of Jin Tao’s daily life over the years without making a single mistake.\nIt could be said that the person Jin Tao trusted the most was his butler.\nTherefore, the butler’s betrayal infuriated Jin Tao.\nJin Yang sighed and explained, “I realized that something was wrong so I tried to persuade the butler to help me find clues and evidence. He firmly rejected my suggestion and didn’t even care what price I offered. The butler said that you were his boss and also his friend. He would never betray you or hurt you…”\n“But half a year ago, his son was hospitalized due to a serious illness. He wanted to discuss with you about leaving the old residence to go back and take care of his son for a period of time.”\nJin Tao’s eyes were blank. A person who ruled the world would not care about the trivial family matters of others. It was just so trivial that he ignored it, but it ended up being the key to Jin Yang successfully bribing the butler!\n“You will never understand how important kinship is to others. You rejected the butler. You were worried that he would leave with your secrets. I helped his son settle the hospitalization procedures and arranged for someone to take care of him. So he was willing to give up on you and choose me instead.”\nJin Tao licked the outline of his teeth with the tip of his tongue and shook his head in disdain.\nThe butler spoke in a hoarse voice, his tone slow but heavy. “Old Master, you are too ruthless.”\n“When I first followed you, you had aspirations to be a leader. But slowly, your ambitions became too big and uncontrollably inflated. You wanted everyone to be obedient puppets, but people have feelings.”\n“Madam was seriously ill and bedridden back then. She didn’t want you to continue sitting in the president’s seat and had an argument with you.”\n“And what did you do? You locked her in her room and forbade anyone from hiring a doctor for her. She died of illness.”\nWhen Jin Yang heard the butler recount the past, dusty and painful memories surfaced in his mind. His body swayed unsteadily. Qiu Tong hurriedly supported his arm and gently placed her slender fingers in his palm. The two of them interlocked their fingers, silently transmitting warmth and companionship.\nThe butler witnessed Jin Tao’s gradual changes and also understood that if he continued to let things go on, a major mistake would be made.\nTherefore, when he learned of the trap today, he secretly communicated information about Jin Tao’s troop deployment to Jin Yang. He also removed the bullets from Jin Tao’s gun.\n“Father, when will you understand that winning over the hearts of others is the only way to manage things?”\n“Relying on tough methods and so-called mutant armies will never succeed!”\nJin Yang waved his hand, indicating for Shao An to leave with Jin Tao and Terrence.\nIn the next second, he saw a familiar but unexpected figure appear outside the secret room. Song Yan walked to them with Qiu Xingyuan, Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu. He placed his finger on the trigger, forcing Shao An to stop.\nSong Yan slowly came to Jin Tao’s side and handed him the gun. “Qiu Rong and Ye Luan are both outside.”\n“Good, well done!”\nJin Tao patted Song Yan’s shoulder, his eyes filled with relief as he said, “I was right after all.”\n“Are you crazy?”\nJin Yang asked with a trembling voice. He did not expect Song Yan to be involved in this. “What you’re doing now might ruin everyone! Qiu Xingyuan and Little Yu are your children. Can you really bear to make use of them?”\n“You’re not fit to be a father!”\nAt this moment, Jin Yang could not be bothered with anything else. Pain flashed across Song Yan’s eyes, but he did not answer.\nJin Tao glanced at Qiu Tong and Jin Yang in surprise. “His children? You… don’t remember what happened in the past?”\nThese words were like a stone thrown into a calm lake, causing major ripples.\nJin Tao shook his head gently and said, “These children belong to you and Qiu Tong!”\nQiu Tong and Jin Yang stood rooted to the ground. They muttered softly. “What did you say?”\nJin Tao regained control of the situation and said kindly, “Didn’t you find that photo in the Qiu family’s old residence? That’s right, you were once Jin Yang’s lover, and these children are his. It’s just that I realized that you would affect my plan, so I made a preemptive move.”\n“Your appearance changed Jin Yang. He started to ignore my orders. He even secretly tracked the Vulture Organization.”\n“That’s why I asked the Vulture Organization to hunt you down…”\nJin Yang felt a sharp pain in his temples. Countless memories surged into his mind with Jin Tao’s words.",

      "content": "Chapter 307: Hostage Situation\nMany years ago, on a stormy night.\nThe Vulture Organization sent their top assassins to surround Jin Yang. In order to protect him, Qiu Tong attacked them to attract the enemy’s attention.\nJin Yang dragged his heavily injured body back to the vicinity of the villa, but he was stabbed during an ambush.\n“You were severely injured and in a coma for many days. I got the butler to feed you some medicine that can cause you to lose your memories and completely erase Qiu Tong’s existence from your mind. I wanted to kill Qiu Tong and eliminate future troubles, but she managed to escape and survive.”\n“Not long ago, I discovered that Qiu Tong had reappeared by your side. I wanted to kill her, but I discovered that she had also lost her memories of you. So I used her to influence you and make you follow my plan. Speaking of which, I have to thank her.”\nJin Tao lowered his head and touched the top of Qiu Xingyuan’s head. There was no affection in his eyes.\nQiu Xingyuan understood what Jin Tao had said. His eyes were cold as he jumped up and bit Jin Tao’s thumb.\nJin Tao shoved him away in pain. Looking at the bloody mark on his thumb, he raised his leg and kicked Qiu Xingyuan. “Wild dog!”\nAll that had happened had severely disrupted Jin Yang’s plans.\nHe frowned and asked Song Yan, “You knew from the start?”\nSong Yan did not answer. He lowered his eyes and clenched his fists.\nQiu Tong’s eyes were filled with anger. She used all her strength to break free from the guards. The veins on her neck bulged as she growled, “Why? Qiu Xingyuan and the rest trusted you so much! Jin Yang and I also trusted you, that’s why we let you stay at home to protect them!”\n“Why have you let us down? Why did you drag innocent children into our feud?”\nQiu Tong clenched her fists, her voice trembling from anxiety. “Just because you want to fight with Jin Yang for the position of president? I thought you understood that all those things in the past were just misunderstandings, and things would be different in the future. At the very least, you should remember the time we spent together. I didn’t expect you to have the same cold and ruthless blood flowing in your veins as Jin Tao. You will be left with nothing in the end. Even if you kill Jin Yang and me, no one will ever obey you!”\n“Stop your nonsense!”\nQiu Tong’s words made Song Yan’s thin lips gradually lose color. Jin Tao noticed the fluctuations in his emotions and placed his palm on Song Yan’s shoulder. He said arrogantly, “Don’t listen to their nonsense. If you have power, you will naturally get everything you want!”\n“Let’s go. Bring the scientist to the laboratory.”\nJin Tao came in front of the butler and kicked his chest.\nThe butler spat out two mouthfuls of blood and fell to the ground in pain.\nJin Tao took out a dagger and cut off two of his fingers.\nMuffled wails echoed in the room. Jin Tao threw the bloodstained dagger to the ground and wiped the blood from his palm with a handkerchief before tossing it nonchalantly on the butler’s face.\nTerrence pushed Qiu Rong to the laboratory. Before him were the most high-end instruments and top-grade chemicals.\nThis place had the highest level of security in the Liqing Corporation. Jin Tao pressed the muzzle of the pistol to Qiu Tong’s temple and lazily gestured for Qiu Rong to walk to the test bench. “Scientist, please make two bottles of the drug according to the correct ratio.”\n“If you can concoct it, I will spare your daughter’s life.”\n“Otherwise, she will die in front of you…”\nJin Tao sensed Jin Yang’s cold gaze and waved his hand with a frown. He said impatiently, “Of course, I won’t kill my own son.”\n“I built this building for you guys. After tonight, your whole family will live here. Be it food or other aspects, there will be people taking special care of you. You might even live better than you do outside… just that you won’t have the freedom to leave.”\nJin Tao’s words made Qiu Tong scoff. She raised her stubborn eyebrows and shouted at Qiu Rong, “Dad! Don’t worry about me.”\nThump! Thump!\nTwo heavy punches landed on Qiu Tong’s abdomen. She bent over in pain and her legs went limp. Jin Tao tugged at her hair mercilessly and gave her two tight slaps. “If I were you, I definitely wouldn’t say anything now!”\nQiu Rong wanted to rush over, but there were too many guards surrounding him.\n“I promise to do it, don’t hurt Tongtong!”\nQiu Rong instantly gave in. Ye Luan and Qiu Xingyuan also received permission to help.\nQiu Xingyu glared at Jin Tao with her black, round eyes. She said in a trembling voice, “Evil Grandpa, can I help too? I helped my brother and Grandpa Qiu create a data table for the formula. I still remember a little.”\n“If I can produce it, can you stop hitting Mommy?”\nQiu Xingyu bit her delicate lips, looking like she was about to cry.\nJin Tao’s heart softened. He felt that the little girl would not be able to cause too much trouble. He gestured for Terrence to find her a computer to use.\nWhen Qiu Tong heard Qiu Xingyu’s words, she felt that something was up. She looked up at Qiu Xingyuan and realized that Qiu Xingyuan’s index and middle fingers were crossed and slightly bent. This was their unique communication method. It meant that everything was going according to plan.",

      "content": "Chapter 308: Strategy\nQiu Tong’s pupils constricted violently as she tried her best to maintain her composure.\nAt the counter of the laboratory, Qiu Rong tested the ratio of the chemicals. He took two bottles of chemicals and handed them to Qiu Xingyuan. They exchanged glances and quickly poured the chemicals into the container with some powder. The mixture produced a violent reaction. Countless dense bubbles appeared on the surface of the liquid, and the color of the mixture gradually turned pink.\nQiu Tong frowned and tilted her head to look at Song Yan. He was sitting in front of Qiu Rong and could clearly see their secretive actions.\nHowever, Song Yan did not tell Jin Tao. Instead, he moved to block the others’ view of Qiu Rong and Qiu Xingyuan.\nCould it be…?\nA white light flashed across Qiu Tong’s mind. She instantly understood and quickly exchanged information with Jin Yang.\nQiu Xingyuan swirled the powder while Qiu Xingyu typed on the computer keyboard. She used the same wireless network to attack the Liqing Corporation’s local network and retrieved the Vulture Organization’s terrorist activities in recent years. She also copied the information on the database to the public network and uploaded it to the National Intelligence Agency and other relevant departments.\nThe laboratory was so quiet that there was no sound. Everyone seemed to be busy with their own tasks.\nJin Tao’s gaze landed on Qiu Tong and suddenly felt that something was wrong.\nQiu Tong was very stubborn. She would not let Qiu Rong help them so easily. Her current attitude…\n“Make them stop!”\nJin Tao immediately realized something was wrong and hurriedly shouted. Seeing this, Song Yan flew over to block Qiu Tong. The mercenaries hiding in the dark received the signal and rushed out, controlling the members of the terrorist organization and pressing Jin Tao to the ground.\nQiu Rong wiped the sweat off his forehead and panted heavily as if he had just undergone an intense exercise.\nHe took off his goggles and heaved a sigh of relief. “All the components of the drug have been destroyed.”\n“All the chemicals in this laboratory have been turned into waste.”\nQiu Xingyu rubbed her sore shoulders and sweetly ran to Qiu Tong’s side to claim credit. “Mommy! Little Yu is very good too. All the information Uncle Song Yan asked me to destroy have been deleted. I’ve also destroyed their communication channels on the Dark Web!”\nQiu Tong squatted down in relief and hugged Qiu Xingyu tightly.\nQiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao ran over at the same time and huddled together with them. At this moment, the entire family was basking in the joy of reuniting.\nSong Yan untied Jin Yang and shifted his gaze awkwardly to the floor in the corner.\nQiu Rong broke the silence and explained on behalf of Song Yan, “When Jin Tao contacted Song Yan, we heard it on the phone. Song Yan never thought of hiding it from us. I was the one who suggested that he pretend to agree and confuse Jin Tao so that he could help you complete the mission to destroy the Vulture Organization.”\n“Song Yan was so worried that we will be accidentally hurt. He was very nervous on the way to the company.”\nQiu Rong looked pointedly at Qiu Tong. He gently tilted his head, indicating for her to apologize to Song Yan.\nQiu Tong licked her red lips and said softly with an apologetic expression, “I’m sorry, I misunderstood you. I didn’t mean to say those hurtful words back then. The situation at that time caused me to say those things. If you feel upset, you can punch me a couple of times?”\nSong Yan finally smiled when he heard her sincere apology.\nJin Yang and Song Yan walked to Jin Tao. They looked at their once high and mighty father, who had now fallen to the ground. Their emotions were complicated.\n“Father, you used all sorts of methods to make us fight against each other since we were young, in a vain attempt to separate us. You were able to control us then, but you probably didn’t expect that the truth cannot be forever hidden or altered…”\n“When everything comes to light, it is inevitable to suffer a backlash.”\nJin Yang said in a low voice with pity in his eyes, “We will send you to the relevant legal courts for punishment.”\n“B*stard! How dare you! I’m your father!”\nJin Tao finally shouted in panic. An evil smile appeared on Song Yan’s lips as he played with the loose hair on his forehead. He leaned over and stared at the face that was 70% similar to his. “Are you worthy?”\n“When you tried to harm Jin Yang and used me to kill him, did you ever think that we were your sons?”\n“Let’s not try to stir up such emotions between us. It’s dirtying my ears.”\nSong Yan rubbed his ears and placed his hand on Jin Yang’s shoulder. The two brothers looked at each other and smiled.\nThings seemed to have come to an end. Qiu Tong wanted to walk to their side to celebrate, but she saw Jin Tao’s hand touching his waist.\n“Be careful!”\nQiu Tong shouted. She wanted to push Jin Yang away, but a bullet grazed her temple and pierced through two bottles of chemicals.\nThe pungent liquid splattered on the ground. Jin Tao was still kneeling on the ground. He stared at Qiu Tong with bloodthirsty eyes and pulled the trigger again.\n“Die!”\nA bullet, which seemed to contain all of Jin Tao’s anger, shot out of the barrel. Qiu Tong wanted to dodge, but it was too late. She closed her eyes gently and quietly waited for her fate.",

      "content": "Chapter 309: Life Fading Away\nA pair of hands pushed Qiu Tong away. She staggered to the ground. Jin Yang collapsed weakly into her arms.\nQiu Tong hugged Jin Yang tightly. Seeing the blood flowing out of his chest, she shook her head violently and muttered, “No!”\nJin Yang forced a smile on his lips, wanting to comfort Qiu Tong, but his actions made Qiu Tong’s tears flow even faster.\nQiu Tong pressed her palm against Jin Yang’s chest, trying to use her special ability to heal the wound. She ignored the countless pairs of eyes staring at her. There was only one thought in her mind. She had to save Jin Yang!\nCountless memories surged into Qiu Tong’s mind. She remembered everything!\n“Jin Yang, you promised me that we would grow old together. You can’t go back on your word…”\n“You owe me a wedding. You can’t abandon me like this. Otherwise, I’ll hate you forever! I’ll never forgive you.”\nQiu Tong felt that her special ability was useless against Jin Yang’s injuries. She hugged him in a panic and muttered to herself.\nSong Yan walked towards Jin Tao with a murderous glint in his eyes.\nJin Tao looked at Jin Yang, who was lying in a pool of blood. For some reason, he recalled the time when they were just children. Two identical boys would surround him with toy guns and toy planes, clamoring for his attention.\nAt that time, they were also very happy. When did things start to deteriorate irreversibly?\nJin Tao couldn’t remember. He picked up the gun on the ground as if he had lost his will to fight and slowly aimed it at his temple.\n“Song Yan, you don’t have to do anything.”\nAt the end, Jin Tao chose to end his life, to end his own ambitions and greed.\nHe gave Song Yan the only mercy he could, to not let his son have to kill his own father.\nJin Tao knew that no matter how cold-blooded Song Yan was, he would not be able to bear the psychological trauma of killing his father.\nJin Tao slowly closed his eyes. He didn’t regret his actions, but he hated himself for failing in the end and losing to his two sons.\nMeanwhile, Qiu Xingyuan, Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu rushed to Jin Yang’s side.\nTheir eyes were filled with tears as they looked at Jin Yang. They called out in hoarse voices, “Daddy!” Their shouts made Jin Yang a little more alert. He sat up in Qiu Tong’s arms and raised his hand to touch Qiu Xingyuan’s face.\nTwo streaks of blood appeared on Qiu Xingyuan’s face. Jin Yang frowned and looked at him. “Don’t cry. A man shouldn’t cry.”\n“I have no regrets now. I was able to hear you call me Daddy.”\nQiu Xingyu threw herself into Jin Yang’s arms, her tears blurring her vision. She tugged at Jin Yang’s sleeve and said, “It’ll be fine!”\n“Elder Brother is very powerful. Grandpa, too. They can save you, right?”\nQiu Xingyu turned to look at Qiu Rong, but Qiu Rong lowered his head in silence. The bullet had pierced through his chest. From the amount of blood loss and his current condition, even if he were to undergo surgery on the spot, it would be hopeless. He could only let Jin Yang say his last words.\n“Be good. Daddy knows that you’re all great. Without me by Mommy’s side in the future, you have to bear this responsibility for Daddy.”\n“Don’t argue with Mommy in future, okay?”\nJin Yang coughed and spat out two mouthfuls of blood.\nQiu Tong’s eyes were empty and numb as she covered the wound on his chest. She couldn’t hear anything.\n“Song Yan!”\nJin Yang’s gaze landed on Song Yan. Song Yan knelt beside Jin Yang and suppressed his emotions as he whispered, “Tell me!”\n“I need you to be the president. I know you’re bold and more resourceful than me. You can definitely do better.”\n“Shao An will assist you. Do well for me! Got it?”\nJin Yang held Song Yan’s hand tightly. The two brothers finally understood each other’s hearts now, but it was too late.\n“I want to… talk to Qiu Tong alone.”\nJin Yang spoke slowly and with difficulty. Qiu Rong dragged Qiu Xingyuan, Qiu Xingqiao and Little Yu out of the laboratory. Only the two of them were left in the empty and quiet room. Qiu Tong stared at his face, as if she wanted to engrave his image in her mind.\nShe suddenly smiled and said self-deprecatingly, “You enjoy being a hero?”\n“Who asked you to protect me? You want me to live on, beholden to you, so that I will never forget you.”\n“Jin Yang, that’s impossible! If you dare to close your eyes, I will definitely leave with you…”\nQiu Tong said firmly. Her gaze landed on the dagger on the ground in the distance.\nJin Yang touched her lips with difficulty. He gave a gentle smile. “Tongtong, don’t be stubborn.”\n“The children are still young and they need you to take care of them. Song Yan is rash and there are many things that you will need to keep an eye on…”\n“I can see Song Yan’s feelings for you. After I leave, you might consider being with him… that’s a good choice.”\nJin Yang helped Qiu Tong arrange her future life. Qiu Tong shifted her gaze away and clenched her fists tightly. Her nails dug into her palms and blood dripped onto the ground, but it could not compare to the pain of her heartache.\n“Smile and don’t let me see you cry, okay?”\nJin Yang said weakly. Qiu Tong could feel his life energy fading bit by bit. She smiled with tears falling.",

      "content": "Chapter 310: Finale\n“To be honest, I was attracted to you the day we met again.”\n“Even if I don’t remember my past with you, I still can’t help but care about you. Otherwise, as the president, how could I allow a complete stranger to get close to me? Shao An thought that there was something wrong with my mental state…”\nJin Yang struggled to say these words. After a short pause, he panted heavily. His lips turned ashen and his hands turned cold.\n“No matter how many times I lose my memory, I will always be able to pick you out from the crowd again and fall in love with you.”\n“Qiu Tong, live well and take good care of the children. If there’s a next life, we will meet again.”\nA wind blew gently outside the window. Jin Yang closed his eyes in exhaustion and said slowly, “I won’t leave. I will always stay by your side and the children’s side. The sunshine, the wind, the rain, it will all be me. Don’t be sad. You have to smile!”\n“I promise you.”\nQiu Tong nodded. Jin Yang smiled in relief, his expression and life frozen.\nJin Yang had lied. He had regrets.\nHe wanted to spend the rest of his life with Qiu Tong. He wanted to see Qiu Xingyuan and Qiu Xingqiao grow up and Little Yu fall in love. All their troubles had just ended and he could finally welcome a stable and blissful life.\nHowever, Jin Yang had no choice. He couldn’t just watch as Qiu Tong encountered danger. If he had to choose, he would rather leave by himself.\nQiu Tong hugged Jin Yang’s body, which was gradually growing colder and stiffer by the minute. She kept silent, not moving at all.\nQiu Rong and Song Yan wanted to persuade her, but it was useless.\nFor the next 24 hours, Qiu Tong dealt with Jin Yang’s funeral affairs stoically.\nShe returned to the country with Jin Yang’s photo and locked herself in her room for a month. She refused to see anyone and refused to speak.\nWho was more pitiful? The person who died or the person who was left behind?\nNo one had the answer. Qiu Tong sat by the bed with bloodshot eyes. She was holding Jin Yang’s pajamas in her arms. The room seemed to be filled with his scent. In her daze, Qiu Tong could almost see Jin Yang walking towards her with a smile. He smiled ambiguously and reached out his hand to her.\nQiu Tong raised her hand to the empty air, two drops of tears falling from the corners of her eyes.\nKnock knock. Song Yan pushed the door open and entered. He smelled the alcohol in the air and turned on the lights in the room.\nThe glaring light made Qiu Tong instinctively wince. She frowned and said in a hoarse voice, “Get out.”\n“Jin Yang won’t want to see you like this. The children are worried about you. They squat at the door of your room every day. Little Yu’s eyes are about to burst from crying. Qiu Rong is also refusing to eat and drink because of you. Can you bear to see them suffer for you?”\n“There’s no way to change what happened. We have to move forward!”\nSong Yan took out a foldable knife and threw it in front of Qiu Tong. “Otherwise, you can accompany Jin Yang! This way, there will at least be a deadline. Qiu Rong and the children will be able to walk out of their sadness after being sad for a period of time, and not continue to sink with you!”\n“The current you is not like the Qiu Tong I know at all.”\n“Jin Yang will never love such a cowardly woman.”\nSong Yan turned around and left, slamming the door. Qiu Tong stared at the foldable knife in confusion. She wiped the sharp blade with her finger. The pain of her skin being cut woke her up a little.\nA cool breeze blew in through the open window and a petal landed on Qiu Tong’s palm.\nWarm sunlight shone on the side of her face, as if two invisible hands were stroking her hair. She suddenly smiled brightly.\nSeveral years later, as the president, Song Yan eliminated the Dark Web and the terrorist organization. Qiu Rong and Qiu Xingyuan developed a drug that could improve the functions of the human body. However, this completed drug would not have any side effects on the body. Qiu Xingqiao was successfully accepted by the military special force. As the youngest officer, he protected everyone on this land.\nAs the top boss in the information technology field, Qiu Xingyu had created a VR experience game.\nThe game could read the user’s memories and construct virtual scenes based on real memories. Qiu Xingyu gave this game to Qiu Tong as a gift and named it “Tong”.\nIn the villa, Qiu Tong sat quietly by the window. Time had left its mark on her face.\nShe picked up the VR device and put it on. The virtual world and reality overlapped, making it impossible to tell what was real or fake.\nLight footsteps suddenly came from behind. Qiu Tong turned around and saw Jin Yang’s familiar face. She couldn’t help covering her red lips as tears flowed down her cheeks.\nJin Yang reached out his hand and said in a clear voice, “Tongtong, long time no see.”\nQiu Tong slowly stood up and walked to the empty balcony. She stretched out her hand.\nThe old railing creaked in the wind and swayed gently, as if danger could happen at any moment.\n“Jin Yang, long time no see!”\nSmack… the fluttering white dress was dazzling and bright under the sunlight. The captivating redness encompassing Qiu Tong’s deep longing froze this moment. Forever.\nThe Novel will be updated first on this website. Come back and continue reading tomorrow, everyone!",
