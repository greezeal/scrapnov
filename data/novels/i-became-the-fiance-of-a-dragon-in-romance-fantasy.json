      "content": "One day, strange monsters invaded the world I lived in.\nIn the blink of an eye, the world changed and I accidentally awakened a certain ability.\nThe eyes that penetrate the essence and the body that supports it.\nIt was a talent in itself, and one of the best.\nWhen dealing with things, it was the ability to know how to reach the essence, so the time I saw a certain movement, I was able to copy it intact.\nDealing with monsters every day. That was the role the world has given me.\nSince the world changed, countless values have changed, and people’s thoughts have gradually changed too.\nWhat changed the most was, of course, the perception of good and evil.\nAnd just like that, before you know it, The people's values gradually changed too, now goodness was working for oneself and Evil become something that harms itself.\nI also surrendered to the flow. becauseI didn’t want to be a hogu and I wanted to live.\n[TL NOTE: Hogu is the slang word used by Koreans for a person who is trustworthy and naive, and who is easily deceived. but hukou is the literal pronunciationof the word호구, which the author used but it means many things and one of that is the household registration system used in mainland China. so I used the pronoun word Hogu here instead of the literal pronunciation hukou.]\nIt was my job to protect people through my superior abilities and get paid for them.\nOf course, if the price was insufficient, it did not give them protection.\nEven when people died right in front of my eyes it was nothing to me because it was natural.\nThen one day, I rescued a child.\nScruffy face, shabby clothes. A child holding an old book dearly in her hand, as if it was something very important to her.\nShe was a kid, who couldn’t afford to pay. So I didn't know why did I save her.\nCould it be that it was a remnant of the morals or values that onlyexisted in the previous era that still remained in my mind?\nBut that was just fine.\nIt was just that, the child who was saved by me lowered her head, smiled, and said,\n“Thank you.”\nand It changed me.\nThe child handed me a novel she was holding dearly. And as I cherished the old novel, I felt a certain value pierce into my heart.\nIt was from then. I started to have hope in the value of ‘good’.\nI saved a person and did not receive the price.\nJust, I went out alone, dealt with the monster, and saved the people who were trembling in fear.\nNo one said thank you to me. It must be because the values of the world have changed. It must have been because of the desolate life.\nAs time passed, people started calling me a geek.\nI didn’t care, and It wouldn’t matter if there was at least one geek like me in the twisted world.\nTime continued to pass. I fought and broke my body every day.\nNow They didn’t call me a geek anymore.\nThe title which they used to call me had become a Hogu before I knew it.\nIt was good though.\nBeing a Hogu must have meant realizing the value of the real good.\nMy body was tired, but my heart was proud. One day there will be someone who will say thank you to me. I thought.\nStill, no one said thank you.\n* * *\nAs a human being, I had no choice but to be exhausted.\nActions that were not reciprocated wear out a person and their feelings.\nAs my hopes gradually faded, then one day I remembered A book.\nA book that was given to me by the only child who said thank you to me.\nThe title of the book was\n‘The Dragon’s Child.’\nIt was a coming-of-age novel, a romance novel, in which a girl with dragon lineage and a ferocious appearance with scales all over her body, overcomes all her fears and contempt for those around her.\nThe novel in which her depraved heroine awakens and sheds her skin covering her body and takes on her outstanding appearance was a rather common novel, but nonetheless, it was a novel that strangely touched my heart.\nThe main character of the novel was a girl named Adilun Rodenov.\nEven in the Rodenov family, which has the pure dragon lineage, she is the girl with the thickest blood.\nWith her dark blue hair and golden eyes like the eyes of a dragon, she was outwardly admired by others but rejected humans after realizing the hatred that lurked inside.\nAfter being Abandoned by her fiancé, she has tempered herself. she developed her own abilities without relying on others.\nNumerous setbacks hit her.\nEven so, Adilundid not give up. Even in the midst of people who feared her and despised her as a monster, she realized that she was worthy and worked tirelessly.\nThe only ones who supported her in her process were the people of Rodenov, who held her dragon lineage sacred, which she had inherited from her ancestor dragon.\nEveryone except hers rejected her.\nThe girl continued to break down the prejudices surrounding her. In order to train magic and not betray the trust of the people who supported her.\nAnd finally, she became a whole dragon, she shed all the ugly scales that clung to her and took on a more beautiful appearance than anyone else.\nPeople who feared and rejected her in the meantime now worshiped her, but she refused to be worshiped by them.\nHer beautiful appearance attracted many people to her, but she had already closed her heart.\nThen one day.\nEven in the world of the novel, terrible things began to strike in succession. Monsters were infested and plagues were rampant. The area where she lived was no exception.\nEven after abandoning the humans who had rejected her so far and seeking a way to live, she fought for humans and helped those suffering from the plague.\nAdilun, who had a friendly disposition from birth, could not turn a blind eye to the person who was suffering in front of her.\nEven though she was constantly disappointed in the existence of humans, she did not stop doing good things for humans.\nThe novel was cut off there.\nThe ending was not revealed, and Adilun’s next move was unknown.\nIn particular, since it was a romance novel, I wondered if there would be someone who would care for her later, but that person did not appear.\nThis wasn't a romance novel.\nBut just in case, I searched for the story behind the book, but I couldn’t find it in the end.\nI felt sorry. Because I wanted to see Adilun's life to the end.\nI wholeheartedly supported her as she saved even those who hated and rejected her. By all means, I wished her to be happy with the remaining life left unspent.\nAfter recovering my exhausted body and mind, I went to rescue people again.\n* * *\nFighting every day is proof that you are living a life close to death.\nLike I said, I was dying right now.\nI threw my body to deal with the monster that came into the street, but that monster was too strong. To the extent that I, who was proud of having one of the best skills in the world, was easily pushed back.\nEven at the point, when I was dying, no one shed tears for me.\nOn the threshold of death, what I remembered was Adilun, the main character of The Dragon's Child.\nDid Adilun feel this way too?\nShe devoted herself to serving people, but could she become the same after being rejected endlessly?\nAt that moment, even when I was dying, I wanted to see the story behind the novel.\nIf there is no backstory, I hoped her end will not be as miserable as mine.\nMy vision was gradually blurring.\nMy eyes were closed, and all I could hear is the beeping of tinnitus.\nAt that moment, a small drop of water fell on my face. The one who came into sight filled with blood was the child who handed me the novel the dragon's child.\n“Thank you.”\nI heard those words in my ears that shimmered.\nWhy did this child say thank you to me?\nI was not sure. but then I died.\nBut, strangely, I was able to open my eyes. I was definitely dead.\n“Young master!”\n“Are you all right!?”\n“Here…”\nI felt a terrible pain running through my body, and I opened my eyes to a place other than the monster-infested street.\nAt the same time, countless memories began pouring into me.\nWhen I accepted all that memories, I finally realized.\nEverything I thought so far was my 'past life.\nNow I was a different being than I was in my previous life.\nPhysis Ortaire.\nThe fiancé of Adilun Rodenov, and the one who broke up their engagement and abanded her.\nThat was me...",

      "content": "As soon as the flood of memories ended, the emotions that came over me were embarrassment, guilt, and confusion.\nConfusion and embarrassment come from realizing that the world that I have lived in, is a world of a novel.\nNo, no.\nThis is not a false world or a simple novel.\nIt is a deserved real world where countless people live and breathe.\nAnd the 20 years of living as Physis Ortaire supported it too.\nPeople of this world are not simply fictional characters, they are real. This is a world in which every person passing by on the street, sometimes crying and sometimes laughing, has his or her own life.\nThe confusionabout this world and me was resolved not too long ago, but now there was a more big problem ahead of me.\nGuilt.\nThe guilt I'm feeling now weighs me down with the weight of the 20 years I’ve lived.\nAmong them, the greatest guilt came from what I said to Adilun.\nJust yesterday, I told her:\n'Get out of my sight. I don’t want to see that ugly face of yours again.'\nYes. At that time I couldn’t remember my previous life, so I definitely hated her.\nSkin covered with scales all over the body, and golden eyes that made me shudder just by looking at them. Those eyes digging through everything in me was just uncomfortable for me yesterday.\nAfter the engagement ceremony, I always hurt her.\nEven though I wished her to happy in my previous life.\n“Sick, fool.”\nI unknowingly held my head and spat out curse words with my mouth.\nA voice of bewilderment could be heard all around.\nThe doctor, who was examining me, my family members, and even the servants heard that too and their gaze changed strangely as I suddenly spat out curse words.\nThis doesn’t look like a very good situation.\n“Are you okay?”\nGiltheonOrtaire. Margrave of the Empire and my father checked my complexion and asked if I was okay.\nAt that moment, I realized why I was lying in bed.\nBecause memories from my previous life suddenly came to my mind, I fell off the horse while riding.\nIt was an absurd accident, but even though I fell off the horse, I was not seriously injured.\nWith Physis's weak body, it was normal only when the body was fully recovered, but because at the time when I had fallen off the horse my previous life memory came to my mind, and I was able to sufficiently protect my body.\nHowever, my body ached quite a bit thanks to the unfamiliar movements I performed at the time, but that was tolerable.\n“Yeah. I'm Fine.”\n“I’m glad you’re fine. So, I have a question for you.”\nMy father’s mood changed dramatically.\n“I heard that you were rude to Princess Rodenov.”\nOh\n“…you’re right.”\n“Are you insane? After talking so much about what this betrothal means! Are you still out of your mind?”\nReprimands poured in like frost. Even if I was him, I would do the same, so it was fine, but that give me the impression of how much of a pushover I was in the past.\nFather was right.\nThe engagement between Adilun Rodenov, the princess of Rodenov, and Physis Ortaire, the second son of Ortaire, was purely for political reasons.\nWhile the influence of the central nobles of the empire was growing day by day, the local nobles lost their influence and were being looked down upon by the central nobles.\nThe Duke of Rodenov in the north and the Marquis of Ortaire in the east.\nThe two families, each serving as the bulwark of the Anadheim Empire, could not stand this kind of treatment, and eventually decided that the local aristocrats should join forces, leading to an arranged marriage in the end.\nAnyone may think that the ranks do not match because they are dukes and counts, but the one with the greatest power in the east was the Marquis of Ortaire, to which I belonged, so the Rodenov duchy also made this judgment.\nThe idea of pitting the troubled second son of Ortaire and the only daughter of Rodenov was absurd, but it was clear that both families would be in trouble if that was not done, so my father always asked me to trust him.\nIn the midst of this, even though we had to somehow attach our affection to each other, my attitude of ignoring her was finely reflected in both of our families. So my father’s reaction was natural.\nI just hung my head.\nIn the meantime, the 20 years I’ve lived in this world were weighing on my mind right now.\nBefore getting my previous life memory, I was strangely violent.\nIt wasn’t that I didn’t receive affection or my life was hard.\nHowever, I did not feel much inspiration for emotions such as affection or joy, on the contrary, I felt a strong emotional flow for anger.\nThe results were as follows.\nUnbridled violence and perversity.\nAnd top of that my body was weak because I hadn’t trained much, but because of my birth as Ortaire’s second son, no one was quick to put a hand on my depravity.\nPeople just say, “Act as if you just saw something dirty?” and move on.\nI didn’t know the exact reason why I got the memories of my previous life at this time, but in the end, it was the result of my actions. It was only natural that I had to accept it.\nThe life I lived in direct opposition to the values I pursued in my previous life was now tormenting my mind endlessly.\nIf so, what should I do?\nThe answer was simple.\nI just have to correct my mistakes.\nFortunately, my personality was now being identified with the one I have in my previous life.\nThere was still a little bit of the violent, arrogant temper I had for 20 years, but I was not angry at my father’s words, I suppressed it. I could no longer increase the weight of the guilt that was now weighing down on me.\nThen, straight away, I bowed my head to my father wholeheartedly and said.\n“I'm really sorry about what I did.”\nThe reaction was immediate.\n“Oh, why are you like this… Wait what!!!!?”\nMy father uttered a bewildered voice as if I had acted with something wrong in mind.\n“I was wrong.”\n“Did you get a head injury?”\n“I am fine. And I will go back to Princess Adilun and apologize.”\nMy father still didn’t believe me.\nIt was natural. It was because it was my daily routine before, to fight back, to be beaten, and then to be beaten.\nAnd If I showed myself like this, it was natural that my father would not believe me.\n“Really? Even if you apologize, it will be of no use if the princess does not accept it. Because this engagement must lead to marriage. What would you do if the princess didn’t accept your apology and broke off the marriage?”\nThe word breakup was instantly implanted in my brain.\nIn 'The Dragon’s Child', the engagement between Rodenov and Ortaire was eventually broken, As of right now, next week.\nPrincess Rodenov, who was born with strong dragon blood, was a symbol of absolute worship within Rodenov, even though others feared and hated her.\nIf I treated such a princess carelessly as I did, of course, I would be a criminal who would not be enough to be torn to death by them. Breaking up was a natural thing.\nThen, the words that appeared in the novel weren't very good.\nAnd having broken off my engagement to her and completely shutting her heart, I continued to lead dissolute and disrespectful life after that until my nack was blown off by the assassin of Rodenov.\nIf so, what should I do?\nAs a living being, of course, I didn’t want to die. Moreover, I was also curious about the next story of Adilun, which I hadn’t seen before in the novel.\nWhat was she really like? Will she be able to live a happy life?\nI wished for her to be happy in my previous life, and I still have that wish in my heart.\nIf so, there is only one thing I have to do now.\n“Until the princess forgives me, I will ask for forgiveness. I will bear it no matter what happens.”\nAsking her forgiveness and helping her to meet a happy ending.\nThat was all.\nAfter I finished speaking, I bit my lip and waited for my father’s sentence.\n* * *\nGiltheon Ortaire's POV\nI was dumbfounded.\nWhat kind of situation is this?\nPhysis was the one who struggled against what was right in front of his eyes and couldn’t come to his senses even after being beaten to death by his father or beaten by his older brother.\nHe said that he fell off the horse, so I wondered if he had a head injury because of it.\nOr is it simply a rather sophisticated excuse to avoid the current crisis?\nI could not find a way to properly respond to this unexpected situation.\nEarlier Physis was like an uncontrollable wild bull.\nif he doesn't like something or someone, he used to thrash them until they died or his temper got a little softened, and he never breaks his stubbornness.\nHuian, my first son is gentle and has a soft temperament, but only Physisis like this. At one time, I also suspected that my wife had an affair and Physisis not my child, but that suspicion was eventually dispelled after a while.\nBecause Physis's gradually grown face resembles mine.\nThere were numerous anecdotes about Physis having a bad temper, but putting all of that aside, I was at a loss as to what to say to him.\nHis eyes were straighter and stronger than ever, and every word he uttered had strong power.\nThis wasn’t an attitude born out of mere rebellion.\nFor a moment, I wondered if Physis had gone away and some upright and kind ghost had nested in him, but it was impossible for the ghost to follow the peculiar habits of Physis.\nThis is because anyone can arbitrarily create words, glances, and attitudes, but one cannot easily follow the manners and habits that a person has lived.\nFor example, the habit of biting his lips like now.\nThat was a habit Physisonly do when he said something sincere. A habit that only I, who has seen his sincerity a little by little, is aware of.\nThat really meant that he had changed his temper, but I couldn’t tell if this was a dream or reality.\nFixing Physis's temper meant that the stalwart Ortaire’s only nuisance would disappear.\nAfter much thought, I spoke to Physis.\n“Can you take responsibility for your words?”\n* * *\nAlthough my father has given me countless opportunities, he has never directly mentioned the word responsibility.\nThat means my father noticed my changed attitude.\n“If I will not get forgiveness from Princess Rodenov, I will leave the family. Also, even when I ask for forgiveness, I will put you on probation except for the time you meet Princess Rodenov as needed. Father sets the deadline.”\n“1 year... It’s the price you should pay for rotting yourself.”\n“All right. For one year, I will set aside time to meet Princess Rodenov andforbid myself from all kinds of outside activities.\n“Good night. Now you are definitely an adult too. You will have to take responsibility for your words. Go see her tomorrow, apologize and ask for forgiveness from Princess Rodenov. Put your head on the ground if possible. This betrothal must happen. Do you understand?”\n“I will keep that in mind. Thank you, Father.”\n“Okay. Take responsibility for your words. And… Remember, this is the last chance I can give you.”\nI nodded without speaking.\nfinally tomorrow.\nI can meet Adilun.",

      "content": "As the next day came, after some simple examinations it was confirmed that there was nothing wrong with my body, everybody started preparing for teleporting me to the Rodenov Fortress with the teleportation gate. That time I was feeling as if I was being dragged away.\n“Remember. There is no next time, and you must take responsibility.”\n“I will keep that in mind.”\nDue to my respectful behavior, all my family members started staring at me with wide eyes. Starting with my mother, and everyone around me, even including my elder brother, who usuallydislikes me and always showcases his disapproval by beating me like a dog whenever I make mistakes.\nSeeing their reaction I can see that the evil thing that I committed all these times must be serious.\nI smiled bitterly and told my family.\n“Anyway, I will go.”\nIn an instant, my vision went black and after a few seconds, I could see the road.\nThe characteristics of the teleportation gate were simple.\nWhen the designated coordinates are set, the person who uses the gate can find a path in the dark inside of the gate, at the end of which there is a door of light.\nThe person inside the gate simply had to walk all the way to the doorwhich the light is coming from.\nI also walked down the path of light and passed through the door to reach my destination, and for a moment when I was closing and opening my eyes, I felt my vision suddenly become brighter.\nThe scenery that was reflected in the eyes was of the outer castle which was boasting overwhelming intimidation, and the snowfield outside of the outer castle where a snowstorm was blowing.\nIt was not a fortress that can be called blessed by nature. it was far from that, This was a place where winter engraves its footsteps throughout the year.\nThis was the fortress city Caltix, which was built in the Duchy of Rodenov in the north.\nAfter exiting the teleportation gate, I immediately went through the check-in process.\n“Welcome to Caltix Master Physis Ortaire, It’s only been two days since princess met you.”\nThe words that the person managing the teleportation gate spoke to me, were polite but cold as ice and his attitude was rude, but it was expected.\nIn the Duchy of Rodenov, where dragon blood is sacred, insulting Adilun, who inherited the thickest blood, was tantamount to earning their enmity.\nI have committed that sin, so I nodded my head at that cold and rude attitude.\n“It’s been two days. Sir Tyr.”\n“What business did you come for?”\nThe characteristics of the Rodenov knights were revealed in his every word, the characteristic of not showing any respect to those with hostility.\nFrom their point of view, who always have to fight against the ferocious monsters of the north, ruthlessness toward the enemy is an indispensable feature.\nHe asked with a complicated expression on his face while emitting the energy that he would have taken out his sword right away if it hadn’t been for a political relationship.\n“I came here because I wanted to apologize for my rudeness to the princess two days ago.”\n“……”\nIt seemed that there were a lot of things that Sir Tyr wanted to say, but he forcibly put up with them and finished the check-in process without saying anything.\nProbably, there must have been a lot of curse words in his mouth that he want to say but couldn’t say.\n* * *\nAfter the check-in process was over, I headed straight to Caltix’s inner sanctuary.\nThe teleportation gate was installed in the outer castle, so the road to the inner castle was quite long.\nAs the fortified city in charge of the north, the wide area and overwhelming height of the walls was giving me some kind of intimidation just by looking at them.\nEven the buildings I've seen in my previous life are incomparable to them.\nThe size of the outer castle alone was overwhelming, but the inner strength was also formidable.\nA cool chill penetrated my body. Compared to my previous life, my weak body was a lot weaker, and it made me tremble because of the cold.\nOriginally, I could have requested a wagon or any other vehicle, but I deliberately didn’t.\nWouldn’t you feel bad and angry if the person who had insulted you came to apologize, but with a haughty attitude, and asked for king-like treatment?\n'I at least have to show this level of humbleness.'\nThey say that walking gives you warmth but no matter how long I walked, my cold didn't decrease, and when I arrived at the door of the inner sanctuary the cold was etched deep into my bones.\nThe guards guarding the castle soon confirmed my identity and, like Sir Tyr, opened the door without saying anything, albeit coldly.\nAs they opened the gate and I entered, I saw the scenery of the neatly decorated garden.\nEven in winter, the flowers that showed off their vitality were making the garden bright by just existing, and the faces of the attendants and maids who trimmed them had smiles regardless of the cold weather.\nThey must have been feeling quite proud just by working in this castle.\nThat also proves that the owner of the castle treats them very well.\nThe duke of the north, who is the sole lord of the castle city of Caltix and the entire Duchy of Rodenov\n'I really want to know the character of Duke Johannes Rodenov now.'\nThe expression of the maids and attendants hardened in an instant when they discovered me.\nThe smile that I just caught a glimpse of, was now nowhere to be found and on top of that, they were looking at me with a sharp attitude, as if they were dealing with an enemy.\nAmong them, one maid who seem to be in charge of all maids bowed her head to me and said.\n“I’ll take you to the drawing room.”\n“All right.”\nThe head maid of a duchy usually belonged to one of the vassal families of that duchy, and in this case, Sarah Lorraine, the head maid of Rodenov, was an aristocrat serving Rodenov for more than 30 years.\nIt was a status that could not be ignored by the second son who was not even the heir to the count’s family.\nSo, if I treat her in a rude way it will be the same as ignoring Rodenov.\nSo I answered her politely. Then the head maid widened her eyes, just like my family earlier.\nI understood her reaction and smiled bitterly. It happens unexpectedly often.\nFollowing the maid’s guidance, I arrived at an antique-decorated room and sat down on the sofa to wait.\nhow much time has passed\nThe door opened, and a girl with dark blue hair, golden eyes, and blue-white scales appeared in front of me.\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\nI looked at the young man in front of me.\nOnly two days ago. It was just two days ago, the same young man spoke terrible words to me and left.\nI don’t know why he came here now, but he came to me again before the painful scars were healed.\nI knew that my appearance was different from others.\nThe scales that have stuck to my body since I was born and my foreign skin that is different from other.\nBut people cared for me. Mother and father, head maid, butler, and all the knights cared for me.\nBut I knew from the start that I was different from other. unlike me, didn’t have scales.\nWhen I asked why I have them, my father and mother told me, that you are a child born with the dragon’s blessing and you are our pride.\nFrom that day on, these blue-white scales were my pride.\nEvery day I heard people’s blessings.\nThe precious people of Rodenov, The people I will one day rule over, honored me with one heart and one mind.\nMy blue-white skin seemed to be the color of winter, so I thought my body was harboring winter.\nThe snow falling lightly on the fort, the occasional sunbeam shining and melting the snow, the sound of footsteps stepping on the snow, the falling snow piled up on the trees, and the distant scenery of the snowy field, I thought all of those things were together inside me.\nBut my pride was shattered one day.\nIt was the day when there was a gathering of noble families.\nI dressed up in beautiful clothes, like those of fairy tails, and entered the ballroom with proud steps.\nAt that time, I could not forget the sound I heard.\nMonster!!, Gross thing... a demon!.\nNobles were whispering like that.\nMy ears, which are much more sensitive than others, picked up the words they whispered, and I had no choice but to witness my own difference, which I had been proud of, becoming nothing but a mistake.\nThe funny thing is, those who whispered such things about my scales, called it brilliant and god's blessings in front of me.\nAlas, from then on I couldn’t believe what people were saying.\nOn the outside, they will praise me, but behind the scenes, they will laugh at me and see me as a monster.\nIt’s just that I’m of Rodenov lineage, so they can’t openly say those things.\nI believed that all sorts of reluctance, fear, and disgust would accompany their gaze at me.\nI was ignorant of people and ignorant of their culture.\nAnd that ignorance immediately became the blade that attacked me.\nA space where young ladies gather and chat. Being ignorant of their own laws and regulations, I was attacked countless times by them.\nFaced with the malice in their every expression, I realized that I had been so foolish.\nWhat is the blood of a dragon? What is the mark of a dragon?\nThose things don’t give any help to the world I live in.\nI studied. About things, I don’t know, about their education, their culture, and things they do or like.\nI didn’t have many opportunities to use them, but it was thrilling to see the contempt in their eyes suddenly changing and becoming alertness and fear.\nYes. Knowledge was power, and no one with power could ignore it.\nI wanted to get even physical strength.\nMy slender body was not suited to martial arts, but my natural dragon bloodline and my superior intellect led me to the realm of magic.\nFrom then on, I was completely immersed in magic.\nThe power to twist the logic of the world, the power to recreate the scenery of winter even in the middle of summer, I was fascinated by that unreal power, and I only delved into magic without going outside.\nFor five years I locked myself in the castle and concentrated only on magic. In the meantime, I heard something new.\nIt was about Rodenov and Ortaire’s arranged marriage.\nThere had been stories about engagements before, but most of them were about engagements with northern nobles, so I couldn’t help but open my eyes wide at the story.\nMy first meeting with Physis Ortaire was, of course, terrifying.\nAs soon as he saw me, he openly put on an expression that He is looking at something terrible in his eyes. Following his facial expression, my emotions became terrified.\nIt was a terrible meeting for each other in many ways.\nI haven’t had any expectations from Physis since then.\nMaybe he does too. Who would like a gongnyeo who is reputed to be a monster?\n[TL - Gongnyeo is the Korean word used for women who were dedicated to powerful countries by their vessels.]\nBut not expecting it didn’t mean it wouldn’t hurt.\nThe gaze of disgust from the person with whom I had to spend the rest of my life was more scary.\nThe more I met him, the more my heart was covered with scars.\nCracks like scales on my skin began to carve into my heart.\nAnd just two days ago, since he sowed a deep hatred towards me, I also hated him.\nBy the way, did he come here to apologize?\n[Get out of my sight. I don’t want to see that ugly face of yours again.]\nI immediately remembered what he had said two days ago. For the person who told me to go away and never want to see my hideous face again to come now?\n'Under pressure.'\nHe must have been under pressure from the family. The arrogant and rude Physis will apologize?\nUnsurprisingly, the ferocious words came out of my mouth.\n“Why did you come here? Do you not even remember what you said? I went away as you wished, but then why did you come to such a hideous place?”\nCould I have a voice like this?\nI spoke to him in a sharp tone like a thorn made of frost.",

      "content": "“Why did you come here? Do you not even remember what you said? I went away as you wished, but then why did you come to such a hideous place?”\nHearing her words full of hostility that she couldn’t hide, I realized that I had committed a really big mistake.\nAnd her hostility aroused a sense of guilt in me that was incomparable to the hostility I had faced on reaching this drawing room.\nI knew Adilun was a more soft-hearted person than anyone else.\nThe image of her sacrificing herself even to save those who hated and rejected her was deep inside my heart, I already have a big empathy and respect for her, so for me, she was the image of a merciful saintess.\nWhen I listened to how Adilun spoke with such hurt, sorrow, and anger that she couldn’t hide, I knew that what I said to her was not simple words for her, they damaged her pride and inner self.\n“……”\nI stared at her silently, and after that, I immediately fell to my knees.\nForgiveness is not simply verbal, you can't get forgiveness always with words and for me, it's a like a law that must be accompanied by the right action. Crushing someone who has been hurt simply to show off one’s ego wasn’t the thing I was after.\nSo I knelt down, and I saw Adilun with a puzzled look on her face, maybe she was surprised to me see me like this so she began to open her mouth as if she was at a loss for words.\nSeeing her like that I spoke to her to break the silence.\n“Sorry.”\nBut the only word that came out of my mouth was that and I also did not think that she would accept this heartfelt apology.\nA relationship that goes wrong with a word can last for decades, But, what I want now is for her to find some comfort in her heart through this apology.\n“For the abusive language and rude behavior towards the princess. I am on my knees right now and apologize. I know I was in wrong and I'm ready to accept any punishment you give me.”\nCould it be that my extremely polite attitude worked for her? because her expression softened for a moment, but she tried to tell me with an angry look on her face.\n“How can I believe that? If you’re acting like this because of an arranged marriage or your family pressure, if that's the case then quit right away. Because I have no intention of forgiving you.”\n“Yes, Do not forgive me.”\n“…Yeah?”\n“I did not come here to ask for forgiveness. I just came to apologize for the mistakes I made. forgiving me or not is entirely the freedom of the princess.”\nI raised my head and spoke in a calm voice to her. Even if I was kicked out of the family, it didn’t matter. Living alone wasn’t such a big deal to me anyway, since I was aware of the memories of my previous life.\nWith sincerity, I looked into her golden and sharp reptilian eyes. Eyes that instill fear in the viewer. However, I have no doubt that those are the eyes of a person who is more affectionate and kind than anyone else.\nAdilun’s eyes were full of bewilderment and confusion. But she tried to look away from me and said.\n“Go back. I don’t want to hear your story or any excuse anymore!!”\nAdilun called Sara, who was waiting outside the drawing room.\n“Yes, my lady.”\n“Please drag him out.”\nA frost-like sentence fell upon me.\n* * *\nImmediately, I was kicked out of Caltix Castle by soldiers who looked happy.\n-Dhudum!\nThe castle gate was firmly closed.\n“Now this is embarrassing…”\nThe chilly cold kept pounding my body, and on top of that I have a very weak body, so if I stay a little longer, I’ll be in a dangerous state.\nI was gazing at the gates of Caltix Castle while shivering from the cold. What should I do? How can I change her mind?\nThe worry didn’t last long.\nI knelt down slowly in front of the castle gate. As I’m on my knees like that, everything I’ve done up until now ran through my head.\nFor the past 20 years, I have not been able to attach affection to anyone. I quarreled with everyone I met, and curse words and harsh words always came out of my mouth.\nIt was the same with people who were kind to me.\nI was a deficient person from birth, And that deficiency was met by the absurdity of my awareness of my past life, and I was able to realize that everything I had done was wrong.\nHowever, no one will believe me when I realize all of that. It is already too late for the mistakes that have been made.\nPeople do not change easily, and there is no one who easily believes in the words of reformation by a person whom his whole life was rude and bad to everyone.\nBut now I have come this far to undo my current mistakes, so I have to act. I have to apologize to others I have hurt, and I have to repent of my past actions.\nI have no intention of denying the 20 years I have lived. At the time, I have taken everything for granted, However, I had no intention of living like that in the future.\nEveryone needed something valuable to survive, something they can work on or be proud of, and for me, I’ve been thinking of the wrong things as valuable; My pride, and my selfishness.\nIn other words, for everyone, I was a piece of excessive narcissism.\nI abandon the values I have cherished so far and engrave new values within myself. I remove a part of the narcissism that engulfed me.\nI won’t be able to do good to everyone as I did in my previous life. The traces of the 20 years I’ve lived will reject the good I give indiscriminately.\nHowever, at least I will be able to do it to the extent of limiting the range to those who are important to me.\nAs the feeling of rebellion rises within me, ugly selfishness and greed hover within me too, because only I struggle to live for myself.\nSo I forcibly pressed them down and took that selfishnessout of me.\nI engrave the values I have lived in my previous life, and I think of the little child who watched over me at the end of my life.\nI ruminate on the story of Adilun’s struggle against all sorts of hardships and adversity, she was someone I admire, a kind dragon who did not give in to bitter hatred and pain and eventually saved even those who hated her.\nA blizzard pours down, and the cold strikes me as I contemplate my inner self, but I was vehemently ignored. I couldn’t give up on this process now.\nMy hands and feet freeze and snow begins to cover my body. Gradually, the exhaled lungs begin to freeze.\nHowever, my mind was strangely clear. I kept my eyes open and continued my fight with myself.\n* * *\nA report came in from the soldier who kicked Physis out of the gate.\nEven though he was kicked out, he didn’t leave, and he was staring at the castle gate on his knees in this severe winter.\nSo I climbed the castle and looked down at the citadel.\nAnd I saw the look of a disgusting man.\nHe is a man who has spent his whole life in the warm East. I don’t think he has the slightest resistance to the cold.\nWhen he can’t stand it, he’ll shake his butt and go back to his estate.\nI have endured enough, A year was a time when I have no choice but to get to know people even if I don’t like them.\nHe was rude, selfish, and disgusting. Because he instilled disgust in me, who had never hated anyone before.\nI turned my head. I didn’t even want to see him.\nAnd I told Sarah. The moment that person returns to the territory, send the request for a breaking of the engagement.\nSarah told me that she would do that.\n* * *\nMy mind was clear and It was strange.\nEven though my body was clearly not able to withstand this blizzard, my mind, strangely enough, was looking straight at myself.\nEach strand of my hair was frozen, and my hands and feet had no sense of frostbite. Even though it wouldn’t be strange to freeze to death right away, I continued to relieve the narcissism inside me.\nHow much time has passed? Finally, the selfishness and greed within me began to give in. I could clearly feel that my selfishness was shrinking its territory.\nFinally, the howling within me stopped. The terrible selfishness had disappeared, and the flames of greed that had engulfed the inner world were quenched.\nWhen I’ve done all of that. My physical condition was not good.\nThe sound of the blizzard that seemed to tear the eardrums stopped. The smell of winter that came through my nose disappeared before I knew it. My vision gradually grew farther and farther, and I couldn’t even tell what was in front of me.\nMy tongue froze and I couldn’t even make a sound.\nMy mind, which had been strangely clear, began to blur.\nI felt a sensation I had never felt before.\nDeath.\nIt was a particularly fragile body. The body, which had no tolerance for the cold, could not survive the fierce winter.\nAs I was dying like that, someone approached me.\nMy senses were dead and I couldn’t feel anything, but I could tell that someone was strangely approaching me.\nI felt like I could figure out who that person was.\nAdilun, it must be you.\nA gentle, noble dragon. Are you unable to pass even the rogue boat that hurt you?\nWith the last of those thoughts, I lost my mind.\n* * *\nA night that was overshadowed by darkness. I heard a knock on my room door.\n“Miss.”\nIt was Sarah, the maid.\n“What happened?”\n“Would you like to come out for a while?”\n“Out why? What the hell is going on… ”\nFollowing her guidance, I was astonished as I climbed to the top of Caltix Castle.\nPhysis, he was there.\nWith his whole body frozen, it wouldn’t be strange if he died right away. his black hair had turned white from the accumulated snow, but his kneeling posture was still the same.\nThe weather today was terribly cold, even for the people of Rodenov who are accustomed to winter. If I had been on my knees in one place for at least ten hours in such weather with a blizzard… I may have already died\nhe must not die No matter how repulsive he is, he is definitely Ortaire’s second son.\nIf he dies in a place like this, it will create an irreversible river between Ortaire and us, who must form an alliance.\nAnd that would be a great thing for the central nobility.\n“Open the castle gate.”\n“Yeah?”\n“Quickly!”\nI exclaimed urgently.\nAs soon as the gates opened, I quickly approached him. Like a foolish person!\nI slowly approached him and checked his body. His face was pale, and snow covered his neck. Is that all? The hand was already discolored black, they were in such a dangerous state that it would have to be cut off if not treated quickly. I can’t see it, but his feet are probably in the same state.\nThe fortunate thing is that he is still alive.\nThe soldiers followed me, and I quickly instructed them to move Physis.\nI tried to lie him down on the bed, but I couldn’t, his body was so stiff that I couldn’t even lay him on the bed.\nI urgently cast a spell to warm his body to change his posture even a little bit.\nAs soon as he lay down on the bed, I did my best to deploy my healing magic to the fullest, It removed the cold air remaining in the body and helped the activities of the organs that were on the verge of stopping.\nThe fortunate thing was that he had a strong will to live, Even though it would not be strange if he died right away, he was alive and not dead.\nTo the extent that it can be called a miracle.\nWhy are you even doing this? You should have just ignored me and gone back as usual.\nAnd if you had quietly accepted the divorce request, you wouldn’t have had to suffer like this.\nIs it because of an arranged marriage? To avoid breakup? It didn’t seem like anything at all.\nThe man I saw was a thoroughly selfish man, to the point he can’t find the slightest consideration for others.\nRather, I couldn’t understand why a man who seemed to want to break up his marriage more than anyone else acted like this.\nSuch a complex thought caught me, and I ended up staying up all night with a confused mind.",

      "content": "When I opened my eyes, bright light hit my retinas, and warmth surrounded me.\nI looked around and saw a charming room decorated with antique paintings and eye-catching crafts everywhere. And a girl with dark blue hair and bluish-white horns was sleeping while lying her face down on the bed.\nShe was covered in bluish-white scales, and strangely, now I didn’t feel that intense disgust or repulsion which I felt when I first saw her. Rather, the bluish-white scales now looked divine and beautiful to me, but I knew that later she would become a complete dragon and shed her scales of her own will.\nWill I ever be able to witness the sight?\nI forced myself to stand up and thought that it would be painful because my whole body was in poor condition, but it was fine, I didn't feel any pain in my body. It was not possible to survive that cold with my weak body.\nShe must have used healing magic on me.\nBeing of dragon blood, Adilun was well-versed in all types of magic, so I knew for sure that she was the one who saved me.\nI grabbed my head and said to myself that, I made a big mistake again.\nEven though the apology I made to her yesterday was polite and I was determined, but if I had died there, this would not have ended as a simple matter.\nTo apologize and do a foolish thing like this. From Adilun’s point of view, I must have been a terrible and foolish person.\nBut nevertheless, judging from how she healed me, it was clear that Adilun had a good disposition as well.\nNo, is this speculation? Maybe she simply didn’t want to bring unnecessary trouble to her family.\nBut I believed option one, that she is a kind and good person.\nAnd it wasn’t just because of what I saw in the novel, It was because I was able to see how kind and intelligent she really is with her actions, now in my eyes, she shone brighter than ever not because of her appearance or beautiful face but was because of her actions and existence itself.\n“Um......”\nFeeling that I was tossing and turning, she opened her eyes.\n“ah… ?”\n“Good morning.”\nI smiled and said to Adilun with the brightest face I could muster.\nShe barely woke up, looked at me with a puzzled face for a moment, then said.\n“Good morning... what... ”\nI laughed and said.\n“If it’s okay, I will go right now, because I know you don’t want to see me.”\n“All right, but previously…”\nAt Adilun’s words, I got out of bed and bowed my head to thank her.\n“Thank you for saving me.”\nAs if all the strength in her body was drained by those words, she said in a panic.\n“You know what? You are truly terribly selfish. If you apologize like that, you might feel at ease but did you not know or even understand what troubles Rodenov might have been in if you had died?”\n“sorry...”\nI had nothing to say. She was right that time I did not think about any consciousness and even with my personality changed I was acting selfishly for my own feeling of guilt, So I just hung my head and said sorry.\n“Now go back quickly because as you wished so much, the request for divorce will be dismissed. And…”\nShe said to me as if to shoot at what was inside.\n“Now you pretend to be all nice and good, pretend to be pretentious. You are now apologizing to me out of the blue, forgetting that horrible attitude of yours and the disgust and contempt in your eyes from the first day you saw me. Did you think I would accept that?”\nI looked at her with a puzzled expression. She spoke to me with even more indignation, perhaps seeing my complex expression.\n“Don’t make that face. Just looking at it makes me angry. I will never trust you no matter what you say or do! therefore… Just Go back quickly.”\nOh fu*k, it’s already too late.\nEven if I succeeded in reversing the breakup, what would be the meaning here?\nIn my past life, I wished her happiness. But in my current life, I brought her misfortune.\nSo my apologies did not reach her.\n* * *\nI returned to Ortaire city with no idea what the hell I was thinking, and seeing my dejected expression, my father asked.\n“How did go?”\n“For now, she will not break the engagement.”\nWith that alone, my father seemed to have guessed what had happened.\n“For now... Didn’t she accept the apology after all?”\n“Yeah...”\n“You foolish man!!.”\nIt was a word that he spat out as if he was despondent, but it came louder than any scream.\n“Go and rest. You must be tired, that's why you must be making this kind of expression. One year from now, figure out what you need to do and put it into action.”\n“All right.”\n“It’s not just Princess Rodenov, this city is also full of people who have suffered damage because of you. So you will have to ask for forgiveness from all of them.”\n“Yeah.”\nI answered my father in a complicated way.\n“Your behavior may have improved but such a change is not something easily believable and you have never been sincere before.” After a brief pause, my father spoke to me again. “So this is your last chance. If you don’t change this time, I will give up on you. But, if you change… I will trust you again.”\n“I will keep that in mind, father. I will not disappoint you.”\n“Good. Now don’t waste your time in vain.”\nI lost my direction. I, who could do anything in my previous life, disappeared, and only I, who was engulfed in violence and stubbornness and only hurt others, remained.\nWill I sit down because of that?\nNo.\nI have to stand up, I have to act again and change like I did in my previous life. Didn’t I move only for the benefit at first in my previous life? People don’t change easily, but they can change if they want to.\nAfter leaving, I checked the things I had to do.\nI should apologize to those who have been harmed by my mistakes, discipline myself, and help those in trouble.\nAnd when I can confidently claim that I have changed, I should apologize to Adilun again.\nThere was no time to waste.\nI immediately found the butler.\n“Butler!”\nThe change had to start now.\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\nThis is what it is. I will no longer have to worry about Physis Ortaire.\nYes. This is an arranged marriage anyway, we don’t have to trust each other.\nBut why is it so complicated?\nWere his words sincere, or was it a well-packaged pretense?\nNo. There is no point in making such an assumption. He hurt me deeply, and I was free to accept his apology and forgive him. so it's all my choice to forgive him or not.\nI will never trust him again. No, I won’t trust anyone except the people around me.\nBecause I’m too tired to trust anyone.\nNo matter what he does, I will not believe him.\nIt was enough to hurt someone’s trust once, and once was enough to hate and contempt. Every time he cast disgusting glances at me, I hated myself.\nI didn’t want to hate myself anymore.\nI didn’t want to betray the value that my loved ones gave me. I wanted to believe that I'm a person of value.\nTherefore I just wished.\n\"Please..., may Physis never appear in front of me again at any moment before marriage.\"",

      "content": "“…So, these arethings that the young master has done.”\nI was at loss for words as I read the report of my actions, It was an incomparably splendid story. Even the actions of a street wrestler or drunken criminal would be healthier than this.\nI covered my face and sighed.\nThere were things that I vaguely remembered, but I never imagined that the amount of all the bad things I did would be this much.\nThere were many crimes in my report, but the biggest items were violence and mistreatment of servants, and the only good thing was that I was not guilty of rape or murder.\nWell, since my body was weak, I didn’t even have the strength to kill someone.\nAnd in the past, I had no interest in women at all too. Well, those things at least did something good for me.\n'Anyway, I have a lot of work to do now.'\nIt’s difficult to deal with everything right now, so I have no choice but to make the most of the time of the year by working on every problem one by one rather than rushing through it quickly.\n“So what are you planning to do young master?”\nThe butler cautiously asked me as I was thinking.\n“I was thinking of ways to correct my mistakes... I have to make them right because it’s my fault.”\nJudging by his face, it seems that the butler still had doubts in his eyes despite my firm words, it seemed that he couldn’t trust me easily.\nBut when I think about it, it was a natural reaction because 20 years is a long enoughtime to judge a person. And If the guy who had just been living this kind of life until some days ago, suddenly wants to correct what he’s done, most people will likely react that way.\n“Is that so…”\n“I know it’s hard to believe. But now, no matter what anyone says, I will change. That’s just what you need to know.”\n“All right. Let me know if you need any help from me.”\nThe butler nodded and offered his help as if he thought I was being capricious. At first, it seemed like the idea was to match my rhythm. But I shook my head.\n“Thank you for your offer, but I don’t really need any help. I will take care of it by myself.”\n“…Yeah?”\nThe butler’s eyes were momentarily filled with anxiety.\nLeaving the butler behind, I returned to my room.\n* * *\nBack in my room, I immediately started making plans.\nFor now, I should first apologize to the people within the count’s family, and then gradually expand the scope.\n'I should definitely apologize to Adilun, but she won’t listen to me for now and will be angry by just looking at me, so let's hold it off for the time being.'\nFirst of all, it is necessary to change and improve my image in front of the people of my family and the people around me.\nAnd training will also have to go hand in hand. Because after getting my previous life memory, I knew the fact that this world is not so peaceful one too.\nThe movement of monsters, the arrival of the plague, the invasion of the other world, and the civil war of the empire.\nAll of them are unmatched by big incidents and accidents.\nIt won’t be easy to overcome such trials in a weak state like this, so It was essential to train my body and gain strength enough to protect myself.\nWith so many people to apologize to, I will be quite busy for the time being.\nWith all my plans in place, I got up from my desk and moved right away.\nFirst of all, let’s go to the people belonging to my family.\n* * *\n[Emile's POV]\nEmile, a maid belonging to the Ortaire family, was waiting for Physis today with tension.\nIt’s because last month, she was beaten by this terrifying young man.\nAfter being assigned to Physis, Emile’s days were a series of hardships. Physis used to insult her for not even making a mistake, and he would beat her right away if she even made a small mistake.\nThat’s why she couldn’t ask the head maid to change her assignment. If that happens, someone else will eventually be harmed by Physis.\nBeing of good nature, she did not want other maids to be the object of resentment.\nShe just thinks that she is going to have a little harder herself.\nPerhaps the fortunate thing was that the butler and the maid took care of her a little more after hearing the news that she had been beaten.\n'I hope today goes without any problems.'\nEmile, who had hoped so, did her best to serve Physis.\nBut something was strange.\nPhysis, who was supposed to be arguing without any reason, was too quiet. He seemed to be seriously thinking about something.\n'What are you going to do today?'\nEmile was rather afraid of Physis’ silence.\nBut contrary to her expectations, as soon as they stopped, Physistold her something unimaginable.\n“Sorry.”\n“Yeah?”\nEmil was genuinely perplexed.\n“For the time when I beat you, and for the constantly harassing you. I’m sorry about all that.”\nFor a moment, Emile wondered if she had heard something wrong. He is sorry? Who is that young man?\n“Hey, Young master. What are you doing all of a sudden?”\n“It just seemed like that's what I should do. And I also promise that from now on I will never harass you or other maids in the future.”\n“Yes... Yes...”\n'What the hell just happened?'\nEmile was confused, and she did not let go of her tension.\nBecause this could also be a whim or prank. She didn’t know when he would change his mind and use this incident as an excuse to torment her.\nPhysis noticed it too, but he didn’t say much. This kind of suspicious look will continue to follow him from now on.\nHonestly, some things have happened in the past, but the only people who hastily believe that he has changed are people who are lacking somewhere.\nHumans naturally forget grace quickly and remember resentment for a long time.\nPhysis was thoroughly aware of this fact and had foreseen all of this. All he has to do is not to be unfair to such suspicious eyes, but to ignore them calmly and constantly change his behavior.\n* * *\nYoung Master Physis has changed!\nIt was a rumor that hit Count Ortaire recently.\nAfter the last falling horse accident, that person changed strangely, and he was walking around apologizing to the people for what he had done wrong.\nIt wasn’t just a verbal apology. For those who had been severely bullied, he gave equivalent material as compensation and even helped the servants and maids with their work.\nNo matter how probationary he may be, to think that a nobleman helps the servants and maids... In the meantime, everyone who had seen Physis at the count’s house could hardly believe their eyes.\nBut the count’s people were not naive. Most of the people who thought that even these actions might have an ulterior motive continued to look suspiciously at him.\nPhysis humbly accepted those glances and changed his behavior little by little.\nThe most notable change would be that he started practicing at the training ground every day. During the day, he helped the maids and servants, and from evening to late at night, he trained his body.\nIt wasn’t just about training the body.\nAfter asking the knights if they knew something he can learn, he even received a textbook on imperial martial arts and even began training in martial arts.\nHe even politely asked the knights if they could beat him so that they could accompany him to his training every day.\nThe knights, who usually had a lot of things piled up on Physis, readily accepted the offer and beat Physis mercilessly.\nPhysis pushed his body to the limit, almost to the point of overexertion and what was surprising was that Physis was growing at a truly overwhelming rate.\nTo the extent that even the knights stuck out their tongues, Physis’ talent was extraordinary.\nThey don’t know if it’s because he has been fighting so much since the fall, or is it because his instincts are engraved with a sense of fighting, but the way he moves his body and his senses are on a different level than others.\nBut only a few people were happy about that, like Physis’s mother, Seneyu Ortaire.\nMost people just felt uneasy about who the hell Physis was training to beat now.\n[TL: Hey guys hope you are doing great and enjoying the holidays 😎🍻.\nAnd if you want to read a novel full of drama and yandere girls, so you should definitely try my friend Dylan's translation ofWhy are you becoming a villain again?

      "content": "I lay down on the gymnasium as if collapsing.\nThe repeated training in recent weeks might have gotten me used to it, but the knights who realized that I was growing every day did not let go of their hands when dealing with me.\nBecause of that, today, too, I am in a state of rolling to death, And I was usually healed with the help of the priest of the Vitala Church, who resides in the family, but that still did not remove the feeling of fatigue weighing down my body.\nThe knights who were watching my training were all exhausted and sat down in the gymnasium. They looked at me with tired faces.\n'Well, if I were in their position, I would have done the same.'\nI tried to block their attack somehow and ran like a dog.\nI’ve become quite strong, but my body is still weak compared to the knights, so no matter how good my skills are, it wasn’t easy to give them one effective hit, but I didn't want to lose, so I persistently stuck to them and harassed them.\nPerhaps from their point of view, I looked disgusting, but a win is a win.\n“Thank you for your efforts.”\nI said politely and left the gymnasium.\nThe knights would not be happy with me anyway, so it was better to quickly disappear from their eyes.\nThey must have been resentful of my depravity. It would be rather counterproductive to stick to this and that, to just get a good impression. And I don’t think people who hate me will like it if I talk to them.\nThe moment I was about to enter my room, I saw someone approaching me from a distance.\nWith black hair and purple eyes, Huian Ortaire, my brother looked just like me. However, his inclination is the exact opposite, as he is a kind and upright older brother.\n“Brother?”\n“What are you up to?”\nAs soon as he looked at me, he immediately asked.\n“What do you mean?”\n“Pretending to be uncharacteristically sincere, what the hell are you plotting? I don’t think you’re going to live a different life now.”\nI could feel the bitter disbelief in my brother’s words but It was not unexpected.\nBecause even after all the troubles I caused, the person who tried the hardest to somehow lead me to the right path, was neither my father nor my mother but was, my older brother.\nAt the age of 20, I grew up to some extent and began to understand my thoughts. I understood why he reacted like that, as he was the older brother who had been trying to get me to listen to him at least by talking, beating, and with all the things he can do.\n“Your guess is incorrect brother. I'm trying to change and those are just the results.”\nI said it even though I knew my brother wouldn’t believe it. I can’t make up words that will help him to believe me because they don’t exist.\n“It’s hard to believe because of your past actions.”\n“Well, even if you don’t believe me, I understand. I have no intention of telling you to look at me differently now.”\nThe change in my personality was largely due to awareness of my previous life, but I had no intention of treating my previous actions as if they didn't exist.\nI was going to endure all the suspicious glances from people who were been harmed by me, and If I just work hard silently, their gazes will naturally change.\n“And what happened all of a sudden? Just ignore me like before.”\n“I wanted to do that too, but people were so anxious around me that I asked. Do you even know there are not just one or two people in the count family who are afraid of you?.”\n“What kind of thinking is that?”\n“Isn’t that the reason why you practice so hard, that you have a bigger plan later… That means more harm in the future, and most people are thinking like this, and of course, the same goes for me.”\n“Aha...”\nWell, if the guy who was just living like an idiot and arrogant fool suddenly came to his senses, everyone would be suspicious, and since the old me was that kind of person, is it really natural? Or there is something wrong with them?\n“I know you don’t want to believe me, but what everyone thinks isn’t the case, I guarantee that there will be no accidents or problems in the future.”\n“I wish the same too, Physis. There’s nothing I want from you. I don’t even want you to live hard, become a knight, or anything like that. But just please..., don’t make any trouble for the family anymore.”\nIt was a very tired voice. He was the one who had been troubled by me the most, so I can understand his reaction. How painful it must have been for him, for his complexion to be dark like that?\n“I will remember that.”\nTo such a big brother, I just replied what I could.\nIt’s strange no matter how I look at it. My younger brother recently changed. The guy who was always full of anger, and always tried to make others angry, and even enjoyed it, became calmer.\nAlso, uncharacteristically, he went to the servants he had wronged, apologized directly, and even paid compensation with his own money.\nIt was not all, in the past when I told him to work hard, he didn’t even listen to me, but now he was training himself more diligently than anyone else at the gymnasium.\nThe more he trained, the more he grow at an unusual rate, so I couldn’t even believe it.\nAccording to the knights, it was a pity that he was wasting such talent.\nHas he really come to his senses since the last time he fell off a horse?\nHowever, the list of crimes he committed was too large, for him to be believable.\nSo I couldn’t help but think that there was something up.\nFurthermore, since the Count’s family had been living in excessive anxiety every day since he changed, I needed to find out if he was really up to something.\nAs soon as I thought about it, I immediately asked him. What are you scheming?\nThat person said he had nothing to plot or scam, but I couldn’t help and be surprised by his attitude rather than what he said.\nThe person who would have yelled at me in the past because he couldn’t control his anger looked at me resolutely and started talking straight.\nHas he really changed? No, let’s not be fooled For now, it might be just a minor whim.\nBut what kind of wind is blowing? I couldn’t figure out the reason for even such a minor whim.\nAll I could guess was a vague idea that the princess of Rodenov had done something to him.\nAnd he even said to me:\n'I know you don’t want to believe me, but what everyone thinks isn’t the case. I guarantee that there will be no accidents or problems in the future.'\nIt was hard to believe. There’s been a time I’ve seen him acting good too, so I know there’s no way he’ll keep his word, it's just that his acting skill is currently on top. So it would be a waste of time to say anything more here, so in the end I just told him don’t make any more problems for the family.\nPhysis, please don't bring shame to the Ortaire family anymore. I wished.\nI just wanted him to live as if he were dead when he would go to Rodionov's family, I thought so and looked at the documents piled up like a mountain in front of me. Damn! When will this be done?\n* * *\nAfter talking nonsense with my older brother, I returned to my room with a tired body because I had work to do, and that was to accumulate mana in my body.\nI didn’t know about it before realizing my previous life, but after that, I was in for quite a shock.\nNot only the body of my previous life but also the body of my current life was showing a tremendous aptitude for mana.\nEven if I had eyes that could see through the essence, accepting mana was a different issue, so I couldn’t help but train my body optimal for accepting mana.\nThis will allow me to grow much faster. Enough to be able to jump over quite a few knights in one year.\nI calmly meditated, accumulating mana in my body, and gently raised my hand to wrap it around.\nAlthough it was weak, I could feel the mana staying in my fist.\nManaging mana was not difficult because I had experience; The problem was the absolute amount of mana, but even that would be increased quickly with this blessed body.\n'The stronger the power, the better.'\nMy goal is to realize and feel the value of the good that I felt in my previous life.\nThe world I live in right now is the world where the weak can’t even properly argue.\nTherefore, it was necessary to become strong in order to achieve my goal. Even if I can’t do it, I will have to reach the level of my previous life.\nI continued to concentrate and build up mana in my body to become stronger as soon as possible.",

      "content": "Time continued to pass, and for the past three months, whenever I remember a person to whom I had done something wrong, I go there and apologize, make amends, and continue to practice. And because of all of this, Little by little, the suspicious glances around me began to soften too.\nBecause I acted sincerely and did not do something wrong with anyone, my father and mother in particular seemed to acknowledge that I had changed. But my brother still gave me a suspicious look.\nAmong everyone, the servants and maids including Emile were the most suspiciousof me. As I rolled up my arms to help them with their work every day, but since I mainly did the things that servants and maids shun the most, for example, cleaning the barn or carrying heavy laundry, they were all the more suspicious of me.\nAnd that wasn’t all. At first, the knights who were frantic to beat me began to look at me like a monster when they saw me reaching the same level as them. And my growth in my skills was not the only scary thing for them. Over the past three months, my physique has also grown considerably. Right now, my body was incomparably stronger than before and was reminiscent of those of the knights.\nIt was the result of repeated training every day. In addition, as mana was steadily accumulated, the effect of mana on the body could not be ignored.\nMana is the source of life that spreads throughout this world and because I continuously accepted it into my body and handled it efficiently, my body had no choice but to quickly become stronger.\nYes. Let’s keep going like this.\nIt was rather good for me that I was not that social, I was able to skip all the events and trivial birthday banquets, so I was able to devote all my time to training myself.\nHowever, even in the midst of such training, I couldn’t help but think about Adilun from time to time.\nWhat would my fiancée, who hates me so much, be doing now?\n* * *\n“Adilun, You should prepare to go to the center sooner or later.”\n“Yes? father, why are you bringing this up all of a sudden?”\n“It is because the National Foundation Day is arriving soon and his Majesty called all the nobles to attend it. He also said that he would hold the grandest National Foundation Day.”\n“Then… Do I have to go too?”\n“Yes. Everyone who inherited noble blood has to come, it is his majesty's order, and all the central noble children will also come, so you must go too.”\nI was reluctant, moreover, it wasn't the first time for me to go to the center but because only the head of the family had to go to the center on all the founding days It was the first time for me to go to the National Foundation Day.\nAlthough were many events, I thought that the displeasure I would face at the event would outweigh the fun of such an event, so I hansako refused to participate in the National Foundation Day every time.\n[TL: Hansako is the Japanese word that means flower girl and is often used for female. She is using it here as sarcasm. ]\nMy father was always considerate of me and never took me to National Foundation Day. Moreover, for me, who had always lived in the North, the center was just an unfamiliar space. Hence I always refused to go but since it is his majesty's order, I have no choice.\n“I see. If that's the case then I’ll go too.”\nDissatisfaction tried to crawl out, but it was forced down by me.\nIf I get annoyed here or express that I don’t want to go, It will only make trouble for my father.\n“Yes, and also, this time we are moving with Ortaire's, so be aware.”\nBut as my father’s words continued, I sigh unconsciously.\n“… ha....”\n“I always feel sorry for you.”\nI shook my head at my father’s words.\n“No. I am the heir to this vast Rodenov. It’s not like I can’t just live the way I want to. I have to do my duty to enjoy my rights.”\n“Thank you for understanding. Don’t worry too much though. After Physis apologized to you last time, Giltheon told me that If this happens one more time, he will just kick out Physis of the family.”\nWould that person really listen to Count Ortaire? It's always been like this, words like that lingered in my mouth, but I just nodded my head to my father without showing them.\n“I see. If that's the case then maybe it will be okay, father.”\n“Yes. Oh, do you have any questions about National Foundation Day?”\n“I’m not particularly interested in anything, but once I know the event schedule, I can move accordingly, right?”\n“As for the schedule, the first day is a ball, the second day is a hunting competition, the third day is a tournament and the fourth day... There is a martial arts competition.”\n“It’s tight. I think I might be tired… That’s enough. I’ll make it, father.”\n“Now take care and get some rest.”\nAs soon as my father left, a sigh escaped from my mouth.\nI don’t know what’s going to happen, and I have to meet Physis too, who doesn’t want to look at me, and I have to see the central nobles freaking out at me, or seeing my gossip.\nHmm. This much can be tolerated, it's something that has already happened countless times so what would be different if this one was also added.\nThere must have been all sorts of incidents, and just thinking about the discomfort I would feel in them made me tired.\nI just hoped all of this would pass quickly.\n* * *\n“National Foundation Day? Should I go too? Aren't you the one who always goes there?”\n“Yes but his majesty said that all members of the noble families must attend this time. He said he would open it with the greatest grandeur.”\n“Am I not on probation right now?”\n“Is vigilance important for national events? Get ready quickly we will be leaving next week.”\n“I understand. Is there anything I should be careful about?”\n“There is nothing. Try to memorize only the faces of members of the imperial family and each nobleman. And since we will be moving with the members of the Rodenov, you will not be rude to them like last time.”\n“I will keep that in mind.”\nAt my words, my father looked at me and said.\n“I’m glad though. I think you’re somewhat sane. For the past three months, I have been watching your life, and at first, I doubted my eyes.”\n“… Is that so?”\n“I wondered if I could trust you once, seeing how you helped the servants and maids so diligently that and did even the things that the servants and maids shunned. And… You didn’t neglect training either. Apparently, your mana has awakened too.”\nMy father saw through my growth at a glance. My father was a knight vying for supremacy in the empire.\nOne of the seven Sword Saints of the Enadeim Empire belonged to my father.\n“Yeah. Not long ago.”\n“Oh boy, If you had come to your senses right away, you would have grown up listening to the advice of genius, but why did you come to your senses so late?”\nWhen I said that I had awakened Mana, my father clicked his tongue and said.\n“How are you able to do it now?... Anyway, let’s go prepare for National Foundation Day.”\n“Yes, father.”\nIt’s National Foundation Day and he said all the nobles will come, so I’m sure Adilunwill come too. it’s been three months since the last time I met her.\nI started to worry. It was because the central nobles had already begun to picture what they were going to say to her. Numerous scars will be engraved on her heart.\nI thoughtfully shook my head.\nWhat can I do to stop them or make it easy for her?\nNo matter how much I thought about it, I couldn’t find an answer. The biggest problem is that she hates me.\nThere is nothing more disheartening than having someone you hate to set up for you. That’s why I shouldn’t come forward and act in defense of her.\nBecause if I did, it would make her hate me and herself even more.\nWhat should I do?\nI kept thinking over and over again to find the right way.\n* * *\nThe date of National Foundation Day is approaching, and we are ready to leave for Enassa, the capital of Enadeim.\nAs Enassa is the heart of the empire with the imperial castle, the teleport gate is closed because you don’t know what will happen.\nIn the end, we had no choice but to join the people of Rodenov in the territory closer to the center and move together in a wagon.\nSo, inside the carriage. I was sitting on the other side of Adilun. Not a single thing has changed from before, she just looked out the window in awe.\n“How have you been?”\n“Yeah.”\nShe answered dryly. I had no choice but to keep my mouth shut because she didn’t want to talk to me.\nA heavy silence covered the inside of the carriage. An uncomfortable feeling like sitting on a cushion of thorns came over me.\nHow long has it been like that? While I was silent, she looked at me blankly and suddenly spoke to me.\n“Excuse me.”\n“Yes?”\nAdilun paused for a moment, then spoke with difficulty.\n“Let’s pretend to be as friendly as possible during this National Foundation Day... You know why Rodenov and Ortaire met? right”\n“Isn’t it to keep checks on the central nobles?”\n“Yes. So, if our relationship looks bad, they can think that the bond between Rodenov and Ortaire is weak and can be broken with a little shaking. Because they are always frantic to undermine the power of countryside nobles.”\nThat’s a valid opinion.\nI nodded.\n“Certainly they can.”\n“Yes, So during that Day celebrations, speak as friendly as possible. I will try to do the same. To be honest, I hate to see you, but for the sake of my family, I can’t help it.”\nShe told me her true feelings.\n“Well, I see. You mean acting a friendly betrothed relationship.”\n“Exactly.”\n“Just leave it to me. I will do my best.”\nEven though I answered seriously, she still looked suspiciously at me.\n“And just in case, in the capital, don’t act rashly like you do in your family. As long as I am tied to you through the relationship of engagement, your reputation is directly related to me.”\n“That will not happen.”\n“Hmm, just don't do something wrong.”\nAfter that, Adilun turned her head to look out the window, and the carriage was enveloped in silence again.",

      "content": "Uncomfortable silence continued until we reached Enassa because, first of all, I didn’t know what Adilun was interested in, and if I tried to say anything, she immediately blocked me, so the conversation didn’t even start.\nSo in the end, we arrived at Enassa city without saying anything to each other, and when I saw Enassa, I automatically spat in admiration.\n“Wow!”\nRecently, quite a lot of problems have arisen due to the violence of the central aristocrats backed by the emperor but despitethat Enadeim empirewas still strong.\nOn National Foundation Day, Enassawas crowded with many people and after a brief inspection, we were able to enter immediately.\nAfter entering the city, we immediately boarded a wagon and headed for the imperial castle.\nThis was because Ortaire and Rodenov had to stay in the palace provided by the imperial castle, as they did not have a separate mansion in the capital.\nWe were supposed to take a tour of the city first, but both families decided that there was no time to delay and headed straight to the imperial castle.\nOutside the carriage, the sight of Enassa was passing by as fast as the wind. Meanwhile, my eyes caught the faces of people trying hard to maintain their brightness even while living in the shadows.\nAs for National Foundation Day, they should reduce the burden of the hard life of the people who live here like this, so that they too can enjoy it. Seeing them trying hard to live and smiling even in a condition like this, shows the work of the central noble.\nThe magnificence of seeing this place from the outside disappears due to the shadows cast by the people who living here.\nLooking at that figure, I couldn’t help but think about the central nobles. Apparently, the central nobles are running amok.\nCentral nobles are in fact parasites that eat away at this country, and they are the people who will interfere with Adilunin the future without any reason.\nOf course, there is a division between the moderates and the radicals, but their feelings are the same. A greedy temperament that wants to incorporate local power into one’s own.\nIf possible, I wanted to avoid friction with them as much as possible on this National Foundation Day.\nThey will definitely try to disparage Adilun in some way because, for these people who want to cut down the power of the local nobility, Adilun will be pretty tasty prey.\n“Tsk!.”\nAs I clicked my tongue and lowered the curtains attached to the wagon, Adilun, who was just looking at the scenery of Enassa, looked at me curiously and asked.\n“What's wrong?”\n“Nothing.”\nJudging that it was not something she should find out about, I evaded her question altogether.\n“Your expression says otherwise.”\nShe said to me with an expressionless face.\n“It’s really none of your business. And It's not about you either. It's Just because I saw an unpleasant scene outside.”\n“Whatever, but for now, let go of your expression. It seems that we are getting closer to the imperial castle, so I think you need to pay attention to your each expression.”\n“All right, I'll do that...”\nSince I have seen something unpleasant, I should watch a scene that calms my mind. So I stared blankly at Adilun.\n“…What’s wrong?”\n“No, since I saw an unpleasant scene, shouldn’t I watch the calming scene? That way, I will be able to manage my expression well.”\nAs I smiled and said that, Adilunsuddenly shrank and said:\n“Then why are you looking at me all of a sudden?”\n“Yeah, just looking at you brings peace to my heart.”\n“… ...What nonsense are you even saying?.”\nAdilun looked at me with a disgusted expression but it was somehow funny, and a smile bloomed on my lips.\nReally, I am a person who has a taste for teasing.\n* * *\nI couldn’t believe what he was saying for a moment.\n'I saw an unpleasant scene, so I should get peace of mind?'\n...and see me?\nI couldn’t understand it at all. Why did he say that? Did he really go crazy?\nWhy did he come here now when he said he hated me and told me to stay out of sight?\nIf Physis had said something like that when we first met, I might have been much nicer to him.\nBut now is not then, and he has already come too far to treat him kindly.\nRather, his attitude made me even more suspicious of him. What is the purpose of saying that now? Numerous questions lingered in my mind.\nWhy is he doing this?\nAt that moment, my father’s words came to mind.\nBefore departing for Enassa, he said that if Physis had an accident involving me one more time then, the marriage with Ortaire will be canceled and Physiswould be expelled from the Ortaire family too.\nIf that’s true, I understand why he said that to me. He is treating me kindly for his own good so that he doesn't get expelled from the Ortaire family.\nBut there was one more question in my mind...\nIf he’s really trying to change his attitude, how should I treat him?\nI don’t know!\nMy mind was complicated. Perhaps, this question would haunt me for a long time.\nMy relationship with my fiancé, whom I did not want, was terribly confusing to me.\n* * *\nUpon arriving at the imperial castle, the two families were treated with utmost hospitality and were guided to an empty palace.\nThe first emperor of Enadeim had several mistresses including an empress.\nAs a result, there were quite a lot of empty palaces in the imperial castle, and because of that, all the nobles who did not have mansions in the capital were assigned to each room in the palace.\nWhen I asked the ladies-in-waiting about the future schedule, she told me that there were three days left until the main events of National Foundation Day, including the ball, would start, and I was also told to take care of my actions until then.\nShe said that we would do an audience with the emperor at the beginning of the ball, so with nothing to do, we just stayed in our rooms and spent time.\nOf course, I trained myself by accumulating mana, but Adilun, who was left alone, walked around the palace with an expression of boredom while mumbling a little each time whenever I saw her.\n“Ah, I should have brought a magic book.”\nShe kept repeating what she was saying. Certainly, she had never had soo much free time on her hand as a wizard.\nOne day we were like that and the next day, we were suddenly called by the princess. I couldn’t figure out what the reason was, so I could not help but ask.\n“Why did she call us?”\nAt my question, Adilun said with a very bored face.\n“I don’t know either. Oh, don’t forget what I said.”\n“I’m fine, but are you okay? Your face is still full of dissatisfaction with me.”\n“It’s okay. I’ll take care of myself, so I'm good too.”\n“All right then.”\nAs I was talking to her, Adilun suddenly raised one hand.\n“What are you doing? catch it.”\n“What is it all of a sudden?”\n“Aren’t you supposed to escort me? Since we’re acting as a friendly relationship, shouldn’t we hold hands?”\n“Is that so?”\n“For now, let’s just say that. To be honest, I’m really reluctant, but I can’t help it. The person we will meet is the first princess. She is more sensitive to political issues than anyone else, so we have to be as friendly as possible.”\nAs I held her hand, she spoke to me again.\n“Smile. I will do that too.”\nAs she said that, a subtle smile appeared on her face. On the other hand, I looked at her with a smile on my face because it was somehow funny.\nAs soon as we were ready, we called the lady-in-waiting, and as she confirmed that we were ready, she started guiding us somewhere.\nHow long did it take?\nAfter about ten minutes of walking, we were guided to a fairly well-tended garden.\nSeasonal flowers were showing off in the garden, and at the tea table in the center was a girl with brilliant golden hair looking at us with a surprised expression.\nBecause I remembered the faces of the members of the imperial family, I looked at before participating in the National Foundation Day, I was able to immediately recognize that the girl was the first princess, Lobelia Enadeim.\n“Nice to meet you, Your Highness the Princess. This is Physis Ortaire.”\n“Nice to meet you, YourHighness the Princess. This is Adilun Rodenov.”\nWe greeted the princess according to the etiquette as if drawn.\n“Welcome. Prince Ortaire, Princess Rodenof.”\nThe princess, who had a surprised expression on her face from the movement we came in, greeted us with a smile as if she suddenly came to her senses when she saw us greeting.",

      "content": "“I did not call you for any static cause, but simply because of my personal curiosity and fellowship. So there is no need to be nervous.”\nPrincess Lobelia, who was surprised earlier,looked at Adilun with a kind smile and said.\n“What do you mean by personal curiosity and fellowship, Princess?”\n“That’s..., I need a friend. Oh, I know it would be burdensome to say this out of the blue, right? But it's because I’ve never had anyone who I could call a friend. So it’s always just people who come for political purposes every time.”\nAt her words, Adilunand I couldn’t hide our bewilderment.\nWhy does she suddenly want friends?\nTo Lobelia, who says she needs a friend before getting to know each other properly, the answer we can give is ‘It’s difficult.’\n“How can we dare be friends with Your Highness the Princess?”\nWhen Adilun replied to her in a rather cold tone, Lobelia laughed, saying she knew it.\n“Ah, it was just as I expected. Princess Rodenov, you really felt like someone from cold north, but I really like you because you matched my expectations.”\n“...Yes?”\n“I had a longing for the North from the beginning. The cold snowfield and the people who live against it. And the legend of Altair, the ancestor who protects the North… In short, the more I heard the legend about the ancestral dragon Altair and North, the more mysterious and beautiful it becomes, so I really wanted to go to the North at least once.”\n“Ah, you should definitely come, and thank you for your kind words...”\n“So, can I touch that horn? I know it’s really rude, but I really wanted to meet you and touch it. A princess who inherited dragon blood. What a cool title you have, and those horns are really cool too. It is round, round like a goat, but the color is a mysterious bluish-white. My God, how cool would it be if someone like you were my friend.”\nTo Lobelia, who spoke with her eyes shining, Adilunonly expressed her embarrassment. Even without looking at it, it was obvious why Adilunreacted like that.\nIt was because until now, no one had approached her without hesitation like Princess Lobelia.\nIt was the first time when I saw Adilun so flustered.\n“Yes Yes? My... horns?”\n“Yes. Those horns. That’s what sets you apart from the average person. You know they are really cool?”\n“But I don't feel the same...”\n“Oh my God, really? What a shame.”\nAt the words of Princess Lobelia, who was sincerely sorry and surprised, Adilun, who was next to me, asked.\n“Your Highness, are you not offended by my appearance?”\n“Am I offended? No, not at all! Why would I?”\nShe exclaims proudly.\n“I am facing a legend. Who in the world can see a legend right in front of them? A lot of legends are usually out of my sight. But you are different. You are real and right in front of my eyes! The master of dragon blood! Isn’t that right, Prince Physis?”\nLobelia suddenly turns a finger at me. But that statement had enough validity, so I nodded. If it were me before, I would have asked if she was crazy or hit her head but I have already become a completely different person from before by becoming aware of my previous life.\n“I completely agree.”\n“Yes?”\nAdilun, who momentarily turned her head to me, asked in a puzzled way.\nTo think that she would act and be swayed by embarrassment. She still has a long way off,\n“Adilun, I'm sure that you heard enough of those words and are already used to them, but why are you so embarrassed?”\nI said it to remind her of our act.\n“Ahh. Yes, It is true, but when Her Highness said so, I was so embarrassed that I don’t know what to do.\" And Adilun then turn to Lobelia and said, \"I apologize for showing this disorganized side of mine.”\nAdilun instantly understood my meaning and regained her composure. Seeing the two of us like this, Lobelia said curiously.\n“You two seem to be on good terms, hahaha, ‘I'm sure that you heard enough of those words and are already used to them.’ Oh my goodness! It can not be just a simple arranged marriage!”\nShe smiled broadly and said to us.\n“You guys look good. After watching only the young aristocrats involved in arranged marriages at the center fighting each other every day for infidelity or what, seeing you two gave me a really new feeling.”\nAt those words, we looked at Lobelia with puzzled faces.\n“Anyway, as I said before, my wish is to become friends with you two. Originally, good friendships are made between people who have experience and advanced together, but there are quite a few cases where even the feeling of meeting for the first time can develop into good friendships.”\nSeeing Lobelia’s somewhat earnest attitude, Adilunand I looked at each other and nodded.\n“I hope we get along in the future, You Highness the Princess.”\n“Me too… Please take care of me, You Highness the Princess.”\n“Really? I am so happy!”\nEven so, when I saw Lobelia smiling broadly, I thought it would be better to accept her friendship, but I was wondering internally how much she was hungry for being a friend.\n“Then, let’s redefine the title. From now on, the two of you, please call me ‘Lea’ in private. When it comes to friends, there is no need for honorifics.”\n“But wouldn’t that be too much?”\nAt my question, Lobelia firmly shook her head.\n“Nope... Nicknames are mandatory, and it's not optional.”\n“Me too, Your Highness. I guess it’s a bit too...”\nWhen even Adilunrefused, Princess Lobelia pouted and said,\n“Tell me honestly. You two don’t want to be friends with me, do you? It’s not a vacant seat, all I’m asking you to call me Lea, when there are only three of us in private.”\n“Even if it’s okay to say a nickname, it’s a bit too much...”\nAt my words, Adilun quickly nodded.\n“Ha.”\nLobelia sighed at the sight, seemed to think for a moment, then spoke to us.\n“I see. Then there was no half-talk. Instead, please call Princess Lea or Highness Lobelia. OK?”\n“If that’s okay with you… PrincessLea.”\n“Yes like this. Now as a memorial for our first friendship, can I request something from you?”\n“As a memorial? Yes”\n“Can I touch the horn just once?”\n“Do whatever you want, PrincessLea.”\nTo Lobelia, who spoke innocently, Adilunnodded as if she couldn’t help it.\n* * *\nAs soon as the two of them went out of the garden, I withdrew my innocence.\n“Both of you are bad at acting.”\nUnbeknownst to me, self-talk came out. Maybe it’s because it’s a place where no one is around, so it seems that my mind has been relieved.\nThe two people I saw were awkward. To be precise, Adilun was the most awkward one. Whereas that Physis still acts quite well, Adilun's expression was revealed on her face. Perhaps it was a lie to agree with me when they said that we were good friends.\nWhile talking, when I look at Adilun, who was immediately surprised by Physis’ story, a feelingcomes to mind. A feeling of embarrassment which only comes out when an enemy suddenly acts friendly. But I am perplexed as to why this person is doing this.\nJudging from what I saw and understand, it seems clear at a glance that Adilun hates Physis.\nHowever, it was fortunate that they clearly understood the meaning of their arranged marriage.\nThe engagement of these two people should not be broken for any reason. Only then I will be able to subdue them and increase my power.\nThe fortunate thing is that I made a reason to approach the two even if it was a forced one.\nThe presumptuous word of being a friend, and the words of praising her. Of course, they weren't empty words made to lower Adilun guard. It was true that I was attracted to the story related to the ancestors of the dragons, and it was also true that I was curious about the girl who inherited that blood.\nHow can I hate a girl who even looks mysterious at first glance?\nEven though it was a fairly rude request to touch her horn, seeing that she was not very offended and readily agreed to it, it was clear that she was a pretty good girl with a basic temperament.\nI laughed self-deprecatingly.\nAm I not just like His Majesty, who lives only with the thought of using people like this?\nBut I couldn’t help it. The tyranny of the central nobles was getting worse day by day, so I had to make friends with the local nobles in order to keep it in check, and I had no choice but to hope that their power would only grow stronger.\nIn order to become stronger, a firm union was needed so that the two would not be shaken by any external pressure.\nThen… I should bring the two closer together.\n“Aha.”\nAs soon as I thought of bringing the two closer together, the self-deprecating laugh changed to a joyful one.\nThis is because it reminded me of a romantic love story that I enjoyed watching as a child.\nTwo people on bad terms who were betrothed out of necessity. However, as they act out things they are close to for political purposes, they develop a good feeling little by little, but they get confused and wander around without being able to express their feelings.\nThen the villain appears. Clinging to a person who has a fiancée and making her fiancée jealous... A common yet enjoyable story.\nIf I put the two of them in the flow of the story, they’ll get closer in no time. And top of that Physis seemed to have a crush on Adilun.\nThen… Is my role as a villain to make her fiancee jealous?\nNot bad.\nSince I’m of an age that only has thoughts of using people’s minds, wouldn’t I be perfect for a villain?\nFeeling the joy I felt after a long time, I smiled as I looked up at the sky with an inelegant appearance half-lying on my chair.\nTo begin with, a prom would be nice.",

      "content": "Therefore…Right now, I was surrounded by the maids of the imperial family.\n“Wouldn’t it be better to do your hair like this?”\n“No. I think you can leave the hair as it is.\"\n\"Now that the face is done, the next step is your clothes.”\nWhy the hell are they dressing up me so much? From head to toe, they held me tight and wouldn’t let go.\n“It is over, Prince Ortaire.”\n“Thank you.”\nI answered in a drained voice.\nThe maids and lady-in-waiting of the imperial family are usually daughters of high-ranking aristocratic families. Since they were obviously nobles, I had to be polite enough to them.\nAnyway, after finishing all the decorations on myself like that, the ladies-in-waiting looked at me in admiration. There was even a lady-in-waiting who looked at me and blushed.\nHmm... Looking at the mirror, I hadn’t thought about it before, but after knowing my previous life, I could at least recognize and say that this face is a face that many innocent women could fall for.\nCome to think of it, I always notice that countless letters came to my family every time my older brother went to an event.\nIn any case, there was nothing bad about being good-looking.\nI finished my preparations and waited for Adilun to dress up. As a woman, she will take much longer than me.\nMy expectations were right. I’ve been waiting for her in the waiting room for hours.\nWhy the hell do women take so long to dress up?\nBy the time I was meditating with such thoughts, I heard the sound of the waiting room door opening, and a maid informed me that Adilun was finished dressing up.\nThen, Adilunentered the waiting room. She was wearing a bluish-white dress, like the suit I was wearing, with no skin visible.\nJust by looking at the dress, I could guess it was not an ordinary luxurious dress; the beautifully crafted jewels also highlighted that point.\nAdilun looked at me and opened her eyes wide, but her face soon began to show bitterness.\nAnd even that bitterness quickly disappeared, and what remained after the bitterness was a deep sense of emptiness.\nHer face was expressionless and empty.\nI didn’t know why she was suddenly making that face, but at least I felt that she wasn’t in a good mood, so I asked her carefully.\n“Are you done?”\n“Yeah. It’s over. Let's go now.”\nSaying that Adilun held out her hand to me.\nHowever, her hand was shaking slightly, so I could tell how much pressure she was under at this ball.\nShe must be thinking of the countless other princesses who would keep her in check, and the people who would whisper to themselves while looking at herself covered in bluish-white scales and with horns on her head.\nThe biggest problem is that I can’t give her any psychological comfort.\nEven though I saw her trembling, I couldn’t even say anything to ease Adilun'sfeelings because of the sins I had committed because I was also one of the people who took her confidence away.\nThe insult I had brought to her face the other day on her appearance, although I apologized, must still have left a scar on her heart.\nSaying something for her now would only make her angry and embarrassed.\nAll I can do is hold her hand so that she doesn’t tremble.\n“What’s wrong?”\nShe asked me if she could feel the strength in the hand she was holding.\n“it’s nothing.”\nI couldn’t say anything. I couldn’t even make light jokes like before. Because if I did, she would be genuinely angry.\n“Don’t forget what you promised, because today is the most important day.”\n“I already know. Do not worry too much.”\n“Let’s go.”\nThere was no conversation between us after that.\nIn silence, I could only hope that, she doesn’t get hurt today.\nI know that it is a hopeless wish, a wish that could not come true, but I hoped so.\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\nSeeing the bewildered expressions of the ladies-in-waiting who were dressing me in the dressing room, I just said indifferently.\nPlease don't make too much effort.\nBut they didn’t give up. Even though I couldn’t wear makeup because of the bluish-white scales, they chose the dress that best suited my appearance.\nTheir dressing ideas and dresses ended for a long time. Since my appearance is literally far out of the category of an ordinary woman, they probably don’t even know how to dress me up. However, their efforts were not in vain. I was able to leave the dressing room after wearing a pretty plausible outfit. In the waiting room, I saw Physis dressed in the same color as me.\nIn an instant, my eyes widened. Could it be that I had been defining him as ‘I don’t like that person’ in my mind, so I didn’t recognize the gem? Even any aristocratic woman he encounters will catch him in her eye with his beautiful appearance.\nAt the same time, my face was filled with bitterness.\nIsn’t this a person who is in complete contrast to me with my hideous appearance?\nWhat will the aristocrats think when they see the two of us in contrast? Probably, there will be all sorts of speculations and strange rumors about me.\nI tried to erase the bitterness and forcibly created a blank expression. And feigning composure, I held out my hand to Physis and told him to let's go.\nBut I couldn’t help the shaking of my outstretched hand. I was afraid. I hated myself for being such a weak person.\nWhy am I afraid of other people’s eyes and evaluations? It was pitiful, but instinctively I was overcome with fear.\nDue to the nature of being Princess of Rodenov, I would always have to be exposed to others’ eyes, so I couldn’t be like this forever. Still, I couldn’t hide my fear.\nAt that moment, Physis squeezed my hand tightly. And the shaking stopped...\nIn the tightly held hands, my heart unwittingly loosened up a little.\nI was dumbfounded by him.\nA person I hate so much, why am I so relieved to hold his hands? Did my heart forget the insult he spat and the self-confidence I lost as a result?\nIn the first place, he is the reason why I am afraid of people’s eyes. But why is he showing such a friendly attitude now?\nNo, let’s not believe it. A friendly attitude is just a performance according to my suggestion. He is the one who only thinks of himself so this must also be part of his mask.\nBut… Even so, the warmth from his hand was disturbing my heart.\n* * *\n[Physis's POV]\nWe stood at the door of the ballroom. After the attendant checked us, no, more precisely, seeing Adilun, they immediately realized that Princess Rodenov had arrived, and opened the door to announce are entering.\nThe air in the ballroom was heavy. A whirlpool of emotions swirled inside. It was just an uncomfortable space to be in.\nAnd the gazes of those who gave off those unpleasant emotions turned to me and Adilun.\nThose gazes went through me and reached Adilun. However, Adilun straightly countered those gazes with her characteristic expressionless face.\nAt first glance, she seemed resolute, but her hands still held a slight tremble.\nIt was already expected. All I can do is squeeze Adilun's hand tightly so that it doesn’t tremble. And I know that she will overcome all the virtuous and be resolute in her way in the future too.\nWe went forward and found my father and His Excellency Duke Johannes, Adilun's father.\n“Father.”\n“You’re here. Were there any inconveniences?”\n“There was nothing like that.”\n“All Right. For now, I have only one thing to say to you. Be mindful of your every move.”\n“I will keep that in mind.”\n“...And Princess Adilun.”\n“Yes, Count. Please speak.”\n“I know that there are too many harms my poor son has done to the princess, but I want you to endure him for today. It seems that the atmosphere is not very good. There is nothing good about giving those wolves an excuse.”\n“All right.”\nAdilun also nodded.\n“Still, you both look better than before, Adilun. I know it’s really hard, but just endure it for a little while and then go out and rest. This doesn’t sound like a good place for you to be.”\nHis Excellency, Duke Johannes, said while looking at Adilun.\n“It’s okay. It’s something I have to go through countless times anyway, now is the time to get used to it.”\n“Yes. But never overdo it. And Prince Physis.”\n“Yes? Your Excellency the Duke.”\n“Take care of my daughter.”\n“You don't have to tell me that. I will never make the same mistakes as before.”\nAt my serious attitude, His Excellency the Duke nodded. Of course, there was still doubt in his eyes, but it was expected because of the history of what I had done.\n“Then, slowly, let’s move. There is still quite a bit of time before the members of the imperial family arrived. You should make some level of friendship with those wolves so that you won’t have any trouble later.”\nUnder the leadership of the Duke, we permeated the ballroom in earnest.",

      "content": "They were a pack of wolves who did not even know anything about the person they were hunting. Just like wild animals, all they knew was to bite someone, spread disgust, and fill their stomach.\nThe deep contempt in their eyes was clearly visible. Probably, they weren't happy or welcoming to local aristocrats for even just a day or two.\nSome were surprised to see Adilun’s different appearance from a normal human being, and some were even frightened by her appearance.\nIt’s probably because there were a lot of ears to listen to, so they were not making fun of her with their mouths, but their thoughts would probably boil down to one thing: The monster of Rodenov.\nThe series of emotions in their eyes could not be hidden, so I could judge them right away, and perhaps Adilunfelt that too, hence her hands were trembling slightly. And since she couldn’t show her usual confidant attitude, Adilun had no choice but to be exposed to those gazes. And for now, all I can do is hold her hand and ask in her ear, 'are you okay?'\nHow long has it been like that? Finally, with the loud voice of an attendant announcing that members of the imperial family had arrived at the ballroom, the door to the huge ballroom opened.\nExcluding the empress, people in The Imperial Familyor otherwise called the Golden Clan bloodlinesare always born with brilliant blonde hair and golden eyes. However, the one who stands out the most by far is the emperor, DeasEnadeim.\nHis strong body was beyond description, and what stood in his eyes was a knife-like anticipation. Quite a few people would have trembled just by making eye contact, so it seemed like he was declaring who the emperor was.\nAlthough he recently became tyrannical in collusion with the central nobles, but he was clearly the master of this empire who no one dared to rebel against.\nWhy did he suddenly change his attitude, who was originally famous as a sage? What was his intention for changing this much? Everything was hidden in a veil.\n“His Majesty the Emperor has arrived!”\nAll the nobles bowed their heads as soon as he walked in. Because even if he practiced tyranny, his absolute power was still there.\nWhat may be the reason for the central noble to check the local nobles right now? Is this the emperor’s will, hence they are wagging their tails like this? Because if the emperor hadn’t allowed it, they wouldn’t have done anything like that.\nThe only time we could raise our heads was when the emperor reached the throne in the center of the ball and said.\n“Raise your head.”\nA deep voice descended upon the ballroom. At that moment, even the atmosphere stiffened.\n“It is a happy day. This is the day when Enadeim began. So enjoy my people. This is all I mean.”\nAfter saying that, the emperor sat down on the throne and looked around.\nAnd at that moment, the music starts playing. As if trying to relieve the rigid atmosphere, the upbeat tone evokes the atmosphere of the prom, gradually encouraging the excitement of those present.\nThe main attraction of a ball was, of course, dance. So, eventually, those who have their partners started dancing in sync with the music.\nThe feast of dresses and conquests spinning round and round creates an illusion that you are in a flower field.\nI took Adilun’s hand and said.\n“Shall we go too?”\n“Yes.”\nAdilun was still looking around the crowd with a stiff face. Are there any eyes staring at her? Wouldn’t it be like telling gossip about herself?\nShe seemed to be trying hard to make up her mind, but it couldn’t be easy. The feeling of a trembling hand transmitted to me. But, suddenly, she closed her eyes as if trying to cut herself off from the world, and when she finally opened them again, she had a determined will to block all the gazes of hatred and contempt directed at her, she weaved a shield with the firm will to protect her heart.\nTherefore, the wavering golden eyes regained their original light and did not shake anymore.\n“Let's go. And you should know one thing.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“I dance really well, so follow me. The moment you behave in the slightest clumsiness, I will stomp on you, so keep that in mind.”\nI smiled internally looking at Adilun who was trying to show her confident self. I didn't mind her earlier words because I knew she would not follow them as we could not afford to show our enmity in front of central nobles.\nAt that moment I realized, Why do I want to make her happy? It was because of that point. An attitude to stand up without retreating even in the face of adversity and hardship. Gaining the courage to overcome fear and overcoming it in the end.\nYes. Adilun.\nLet’s go. Let’s show your natural beauty to those who only see your outer appearance and don’t want to see your inner side.\n“Don’t worry. I am quite confident in moving my body too.”\nI replied to her with a smile and confidence.\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\nWith every step taken and our breathing intersected. And I saw Physis in front of my eyes.\nJust as he said he was confident in using his body, he had amazing moves. There was consideration for the other person in each of his steps, and he always moved in sync with my breath.\nOriginally, I wasn’t the type to enjoy dancing actively in front of others, but I changed my mind, to show those who despised me and send a gaze that even harbored hatred, that I was not something to be ignored.\nBehavior has a person’s inclination. If I’m intimidated by that kind of gaze, I’ll just give them an excuse to bite me.\nBut I won’t allow it. If they are wolves who like to bite others, I am the noblest dragon with the thickest blood of the ancestral dragon, Altair.\nIn which food chain, do wolves come before the dragon?\nIf they stick their insignificant teeth at me, I will chew them and swallow them all.\nIt is not necessarily limited to this place. They will continue to look for gaps in me and touch my vices.\nMy resolve came from, funnily enough, Physis’s hand.\nTo feel at peace in the hands of the person who threw my self-esteem into the abyss. Am I crazy too?\nNo, rather, I might have gained more confidence because of that.\nBecause he was the one who treated me the most insignificantly. Seeing that even such a person thought he was wrong, I thought that I might not be the insignificant person I thought I was.\nMaybe that’s too good an interpretation. But, what does that matter now? The important thing now is not to be weak. What I need right now is the courage to overcome those gazes directed at me.\nConfidence dwells in me, and the moment I draw a complete picture of my dance, I can feel the eyes on me.\nAnd a little bit of admiration dwells in the gaze of disgust and contempt.\nI don’t know if it’s another place, but this is definitely a prom.\nThe essence of a ball is dance, and now I must be the most beautiful of them all.\nThere is something I finally realized. That there is no need to be intimidated. I just need to change the way they look at me. There is nothing to be afraid of, I just lay out what I have in front of them.\nBecause the things I’ve accumulated weren’t insignificant by any means.\n* * *\n[Huian's POV]\nI watched my brother and his fiance dance. It was an amazingly beautiful dance. The gaze of the people around them who had been looking at Princess Rodenov as if she were a monster gradually began to change.\nAlong with that, my thoughts about my brother were gradually changing too. It’s such a move to be considerate of your partner like this. It was a move anyone could never even imagine if they knew the usual Physis.\nIt’s a strange thing. Even when I heard the news of the engagement, I couldn’t get used to seeing my younger brother, who had gone crazy as if he had a fucking disease, dance like that.\nMoreover, what happened to him in just 3 months? The time I spent with my younger brother was never like this.\nHas he really come to your senses? I couldn’t figure it out, but somehow I thought it would be different this time.\n3 months is a time that can feel quite short, but it is a period that can be felt as long for a person.\nSince Physis proved his change during that time, shouldn’t I at least get rid of the suspicious gaze?\nIn my eyes, I see the figure of a girl covered in bluish-white scales, a different appearance from others. The living dragon of Rodenov, who is said to have inherited the dragon lineage most heavily in the history of Rodenov, Adilun Rodenov.\nThe girl who had been hurt by my brother was looking at the surroundings with her eyes shining once again with a resolute gaze.\n“That’s it, you don’t have to worry about them.”\nI said to my father, Giltheon, next to me. And he also nodded.\n“I’ve never seen that guy treat someone so sincerely.”\n“Me too. What kind of change of heart could there have been?”\n“Well... I don't know...”\n“But a good thing is a good thing. I’m satisfied that he doesn’t have any more accidents.”\n“That is me too. Anyway, we should do our job. Tsk... My back hurts.”\n“I also have a bit of a sore throat. There are too many people who bother me.”\n“At least, they probably trying their best to separate us from Rodenov.”\n“It looks like they will do quite a bit of tickling.”\n“Don’t fall over. Always think about what they want and act accordingly.”\n“I will keep that in mind.”\nThe two took their eyes off the dance of Physis and Adilun and began contacting the nobles around them.",

      "content": "* * *\n“Both of you danced well.”\nIt was Lobelia who greeted us when we were taking a breath.\n“Oh Thank you for your kind words, Your Highness.”\n“You seemed like you had a lot of talent, but I never imagined that you would have a knack for dancing.”\nAs she was talking to us, her eyes gleamed with admiration and envy.\n“I'm jealous! because I don't have people to dance with.”\nI was confused because, Lobelia, who said that, was the princess, hence she would be the first to dance as soon as the ball started. so I asked in confusion.\n“Didn’t Your Highness dance before we danced?”\n“Oh my gosh. I don’t even want to call dancing with my brother a dance.”\nThere was deep disgust in her eyes. It seemed that she don’t like her brother very much. Well, it’s rare for siblings to get along well, especially given the characteristics of the imperial family, where siblings are rivals. So it was quite natural.\nPeople around us were buzzing as they watched Lobelia approaching us. But in a way, it was expected, because it was the first time we met Lobelia on this National Foundation Day.\nThe sound of the nobles’ heads spinning could be heard. The fact that she was friendly with us makes it look like she wants to gain support from the local nobles. However, even so, no one was able to point it out directly. They just whispered behind our backs.\n“It seems that Her Highness, the 1st princess, is trying to attract local nobles, right?”\n“Will His Majesty wait and see?”\n“Why is she so close to these local villagers?”\nThe problem was that I could hear all their voices in my ears. And on top of that, I started to hear a lot of annoying and bad-mouthing about Adilun too.\n“Oh my gosh. I’m seeing the face of Princess Rodenov for the first time today, but it’s completely according to rumors. She really is a monster.”\n“Look at those scales and the horns on her head. Doesn’t they look no different from a monster?”\n“Only Prince Ortaire is pitiful. He looks so handsome, but he has to marry such a monster because of an arranged marriage. Did you see the forced smile on his face earlier? I feel very sad for him...”\n“I feel the same... She really looks like a monster!”\nEven though I expected such a reaction for a long time, it doesn't mean that I wasn’t angry. Meanwhile, what annoyed me, even more, was perhaps the attitude of associating me with Adilun and talking about me as if I were the victim of some tragedy.\nThe most absurd thing to say was, of course, that I was forcing myself to smile.\nMy expression hardened because I was secretly furious, but I quickly changed my expression before anyone could see.\nLet’s not forget that I have to laugh all day today.\nMy behavior towards Adilunis honest, but everyone present here probably doesn't think the same.\nAccording to popular rumors and belief, I was an unhappy young nobleman betrothed to a monster.\nMaybe Adilun's reaction would be the same too, because she doesn’t believe me, and thinks that I’m really acting.\n“Anyway, what I mean is that, Prince Ortaire, would you like to dance with me?”\n“Yes?”\nWhat was that again, Of course, just because I'm engaged doesn’t mean I have to dance only with my fiancee, and since I’ve already danced the first dance at the ball with Adilun, it was normal to dance with others too. But I thought of turning down all requests. However, I didn’t know or expect that the opponent would be Lobelia.\nLobelia must have sensed my bewilderment, so she told me.\n“Ah, originally I was thinking of requesting a dance from Princess Rodenov. But... I can’t dance the male part at all. Oh, by any chance, Princess Rodenov.”\n“Yes?”\nAt Lobelia’s sudden question, Adilun, who was in a state of perplexity, answered in surprise.\n“Do you know how to play the male part?”\n“Oh, no.”\n“Ahh...”\nLobelia let out a long sigh as if she was truly sorry.\n“See. I can’t help it. I also have a bit of confidence in dancing, so I want to dance with someone who dances well. But when Princess Rodenov's option doesn’t work, the only person left is Prince Ortaire.”\nIf it was another girl, I could just refuse but the problem is that this girl is the princess.\nEven if I wanted to refuse, I could not help but nod my head since no matter how friendly Lobelia is, she is the princess in the end.\nOrtaire and Rodenov could not offend to get into the bad side of the Lobeliafor now.\n* * *\nInstead of the upbeat music from before, calm, static music filled the ballroom. Lobelia spoke to me in the midst of this melody that sounds soggy at first glance.\n“I’m sorry for forcingyou.”\n“What are you talking about? You are not forcing me at all.”\n“Actually, I wanted to talk to you separately.”\n“To me?”\n“Yes.”\nWith an innocent smile on her face, she asked me with a confident look.\nAs expected, when she met us in the garden she was just acting.\n“Now, you know that the stares at you and your fiancé aren’t all that good.”\n“Yes.”\n“You know what people do after dancing at the ball.”\n“Male aristocrats eat and talk to male aristocrats and female aristocrats with female aristocrats. Isn’t it?”\n“Yes. That will force Adilun to face an even harsher environment. Especially since more and more girls are getting jealous of her, because of you.”\n“I just felt that too. They gave me quite a soggy and pitiful stare.”\n“I’m glad you know... Anyway, that’s why when there are female nobles around, there would be a lot of people who gossip about Adilun.”\n“I know... That's why I want to stay by Adilun’s side…”\n“Even though you said it and you were engaged, but the realm of women and men is clearly different. So anyway, what I want to say is that.. I’ll make sure to stop the various attacks on Adilun.”\nI couldn’t understand. Why the hell is she doing this? So I asked.\n“Why are you even doing this?”\n“Do you remember when I first met you I said that there is no political purpose? Actually, that was a lie. I’m sure you’ve heard it already. Instead, let’s be honest. I need your strength. To be precise, the power of the local nobles.”\nIf she, the first princess is aiming for the throne, she will need the nobles' support to empower her. And the faces of the people I saw when I first arrived in Enassa… She must be worried about her people as well.\n“It seems that the tyranny of the central nobles is not the only thing. When I first arrived in Enassa, people’s expressions didn’t look very good.”\n“Your eyesight is also good. Yes. It's for the people of Enassa… Furthermore, I don’t want the people of this country to suffer anymore. So I need your strength. Because the central nobles are already supporting my younger brother.”\nSaying that Lobelia took my hand and turned around. And I said, holding her back.\n“I understand. Then, are you saying that Your Highness will look after Adilun while I’m staying in the capital?”\n“It is not limited to staying in the capital. I have the power to continuously improve the perception of the North and the East, Adilunand you.”\n“It seems a little lacking with just that.”\n“Of course not. Since you are obviously in a position to ask, I have prepared a number of items that you will be satisfied with.”\n“I won’t ask now what they really are. And to say one thing, in the alliance between Ortaire and Rodenov, my opinion is not really that important. I wonder if the thoughts of my brother, father, and Adilunare different.”\n“Did you think I wouldn’t know that much? I already know everything. Also, I was planning to speak to Prince Huian and Count Giltheon separately, and I prepared everything to satisfy them.”\n“Then there is no reason to refuse.”\n“That's true.”\nI can not clearly see the transaction items, but I am in a position to know the future of this world to some extent through my previous life.\nIt was a pretty big harvest just to be able to get her help whenever there was a crisis of great damage in the future.\nAs soon as Lobelia and I put smiles on our lips, the music stopped and the dance ended.\nI turned my head to find Adilun waiting at the seat and saw it at that moment. A bitter smile appeared on her face for a moment.\nWhy Is she making that face?",

      "content": "Adilun's POV]\nIn front of me, two people were dancing. The appearance of Princess Lobelia and Physis dancing and talking to each other in the calm music was different from before, it was so beautiful that anyone would be mesmerized.\nAs her gorgeous blond hair fluttered calmly, admiration erupted from all around.\nEven to me, a woman like her was too beautiful.\nCome to think of it, since I was little, I’ve heard compliments on Princess Lobelia’s beauty. As the saying goes, the sight of her and Physisdancing together now was beautiful in itself, regardless of whether they danced well or not.\nHowever, it was not that Physiswas any less in terms of appearance and beauty- Neatly combed black hair and a rare alluring face.\nSeeing him standing with Princess Lobelia, who alone made the faces of many young ladies blush, made me feel very pitiful.\nI gently touched my skin.\nSmooth, bluish-white scales that can't be called human skin at all. I began to hate my appearance, which some admired because I was of dragon blood, while others condemned me as a hideous monster.\nIt’s a body inherited from my parents, and the pride that I inherited from the legend of my ancestors broke down bit by bit.\nIn fact, I didn’t even want this at all. What I hoped for was not a grandiose legend, It was normality. Just normal life with a normal appearance, meeting other people, talking to them… such things.\nI longed for the kind of normality that was impossible for me. So every time I saw the scene in front of my eyes, I felt bitter, because these people can do things that are impossible for me.\nThe dance comes to an end before I knew it, and as that beautiful dance between those two gradually comes to an end, suddenly, they whispered a word and smiled at each other.\nI was momentarily short of breath. I don’t even know why I’m feeling this. However, what is now gripping my heart can certainly be called misery.\nYes. I was miserable.\nI hated seeing my fiancé, who didn’t get along with me, and Princess Lobelia exchanging smiles with each other. But It wasn’t jealousy, that much was certain.\nHe was the fiancé I hated in the first place. And it wasn’t even an engagement that was concluded by my will. But even so, I couldn’t avoid becoming miserable when I looked at this handsome man and this beautiful woman getting along so well.\nLooking at the two people who create an impossible figure for me, I couldn’t stop longing and feeling self-deprecating.\nIt was a sound I had never heard before when Physis and I were dancing there. It was the sound that told me, the person ‘me’ is not even accepted as a person.\nI suddenly remembered the voice of certain aristocrats who I had forcibly ignored earlier.\n'Look at those scales and the horns on her head? don't they look no different from a monster?'\n'Prince Ortaire is really pitiful. He looks so handsome, but he has to marry such a monster because of an arranged marriage. Did you see the forced smile on his face earlier? I feel very sad for him.'\nEarlier I pretended not to hear them and just ignored them, but that words stuck in my heart. Yes, a monster...\nI am neither human nor animal, but a monster. Even if I do achieve something, it won’t be an achievement for anyone to marvel at, it will justbe the monstrous act of a monster.\nNo. I shook my head and made up my mind to not weaken little by little.\nIt’s not long since I promised myself to have a determined will, so I must not have weak thoughts like this, I must not be led by their intentions.\nWhat am I trying to do by denying myself? All traces of my life, all the affection I received from my parents, should not be attributed to nonsense.\nYes. Let us not be weak, Adilun.\nBut even after repeating that, I couldn’t help but feel the bitterness rising from the inside.\nAlso, I miss the North. If the cold yet strong wind hits my face, these miscellaneous thoughts will fly away automatically.\n* * *\n[Physis's POV]\nAdilun’s bitter expression didn’t last long, but I saw them clearly.\nWhy Is she making that face?\nI thought about why. Is it because I danced with Lobelia?\nNo, I shook my head because definitely it can not be the case because she obviously hates me, then why the hell would she feel bad even if I dance with Lobelia or anyone else?\nThere must be a lot of other reasons, but I didn’t know them. Because penetrating the essence of the target did not mean that I could even read the mind.\nThe heart that was satisfied with a fairly large harvest quickly becomes frustrated. And After the bitterness on her face had passed, what was left behind was emptiness.\nDid she hear anything from the nobles around her? It was most likely the case.\n“Adilun,is there something wrong?”\n“No.”\nThe face, which had softened a little while ago, suddenly became chilly again like a blade.\n“No not really... I really don’t mind any...”\nShe said it was nothing, but her tone was quite sharp.\nSeeing that the face of Adilun, who was relieved and delighted with the beautiful dance she had performed, had become darkly stained at that moment, even I felt depressed.\n“Is everything really okay with you or did something really happen? Because you look sad.”\n“No, Really. It's really nothing.”\nEvery single word made me feel a little bit sick as if she was rejecting me and as if she had given up on everything.\nPerhaps if I said any more word here, she would surely be angry. In the end, without saying anything, I had no choice but to follow the next procedure of the prom.\nNow it was the time for young male aristocrats to socialize with male aristocrats and female aristocrats with female aristocrats. The female nobles will enjoy a simple tea time in the garden, and the male nobles will chat among themselves in the venue.\nI was standing in a corner of the banquet hall in a daze, and my older brother approached me, perhaps seeing something strange about my condition.\n“Has anything happened? I don’t like the look on Princess Rodenov’s face.”\n“Ah, brother.”\nMy older brother asked because he felt the sudden apathy between me andAdilun.\n“I don’t know either. I’m sureAdilun'sexpression was good just a moment ago...”\n“Isn’t that because you danced with Her Highness?”\n“It wouldn’t be the case, she would not feel that kind of jealousy over me. I’m sure.”\n“Why?”\n“BecauseAdilunhates me because of what I did to her- I openly insulted her in front of everyone several times, so it would be impossible to have a crush on me like that.”\n“Still, you never know about a woman's heart. And you still have a pretty face too.”\n“That's the difference between you and me? And as jealousy is an emotion that usually appears when a person has a crush or affection for another person of the opposite sex… So It certainly won’t be the case here.”\n“It won't be? It’s complicated. Tsk... Didn’t you do well initially today? I don’t know what tricks would be used if the relationship is cold like this.”\nMy older brother said that and clicked his tongue slightly.\n“I know... Haah.”\nWhen I let out a sigh, my older brother told me.\n“Anyway, what can’t be helped is unavoidable. Once you’re done, don’t give even the slightest excuse to the central nobles over there because there might be some crazy people who are envious and jealous of you dancing with Her Highness.”\n“I know that much.”\n“Ah, but.”\n“What else can I do?”\n“If they ignore you or Princess Rodenov, or talk nonsense about the alliance between the two families…”\n“if?”\n“Defeat without remorse. I won’t say anything about accidents like that.”\n“Is this true! Can I do it so openly?”\n“Yes, because you are a member of Ortaire and will soon become Rodenov’s son-in-law. If anyone disrespects you or Princess Rodenov or puts you down. Do what you’re good at.”\n“I will.”\n“An insult to the person's family is a legitimate reason for a duel. It would work better for you to pretend to be crazy than to give them something to chew on. People like them don’t easily change their perception of someone they start ignoring... But just don’t belittle our family.”\n“I will keep that in mind.”\nI nodded my head in agreement with my brother’s words. It’s better to be certain than to act clumsily.\n“Because they will not want to associate with a madman. If you’re going to run into it, be sure to step on it so they don’t even think about climbing. At least at your level, you won’t lose to the idiots here.”\n“It’s a little awkward when you say that.”\n“Hmm really?”\n“It seems strange that you overestimate me…”\n“Seeing you train with the knights for three months, I automatically have no choice but to revise my evaluation. you damn bastard Anyway, behave well.”\n“All right.”\nMy brother said that and turned his back.\n* * *\nRight after Huain walked away from Physis, I immediately pulled out something that looked like a small bead from my bosom. It was a magic tool with a recording function stored in it.\n‘Certainly, among the central nobles, there will be those who insult you and Princess Rodenov. If so, there is a high possibility of getting caught up in trouble due to your personality where the first goes first...'\nI immediately picked up my magic tools and got into the gap of some nobles who were glaring fiercely at Physis.",

      "content": "The time when the sun goes down, princess Lobelia and many princesses, including me, headed to the princess’s garden.\nIt was getting dark outside, but the garden was kept bright thanks to various magic tools, and it became like a secret garden in some sort of story.\nEarlier, when I visited the garden during the day, it was completely different even though just the time had changed.\n“Wow...”\nEach of the princesses had a dreamy look on their faces because of the beautiful appearance of the garden. But I wasn’t very impressed. Bitterness and misery Still lingered inside me, and I said to myself,\n'It's just beautiful, nothing more, just a bit of an impression.'\nThe words of all the princesses weren’t really audible to me because it was hard to find meaning in their conversations, which only listed simple gossip. Also, since I wasn’t even familiar with them, I felt like I was the only one left out.\n“By the way, Your Highness the Princess. How do you know Prince Ortaire?”\nIt was until someone put Physis on the topic of conversation. As soon as I heard about Physis, my nerves automatically turned to them.\nWhy is this happing to me? It has nothing to do with me, it’s just about my fiancé, and also it's a marriage of convenience so it shouldn't matter to me. Then why?\nIs it because of the misery and inferiority I felt while watching him?\n“I met him a few days ago. Here, with Princess Rodenov.”\n“Aha… Anyway, you both were really amazing. Your Highness dancing with him earlier was so beautiful that I was in awe.”\nHahaha. Yes, I knew it would be like this. In the end, I don’t think the dance I did make any impression.\n“It wasn’t just that. When I was with Prince Ortaire, my heart skipped a beat because of his kind attitude. God, how can he be so cool?”\n'Hahaha'\nA mischievous laugh came out of me. You don’t know him, so you can say that. You don't even know how horrible the one year was when I was with him.\nI didn’t want to be treated like a queen. So I tried to be satisfied even if it was just a normal arranged marriage. but… His attitude wasn’t even that good.\nThe year I was engaged to him was a dreadful time. To have my prospective fiancé look at me with disgust and contempt was horrible beyond words.\nAn attitude that infinitely lowers the value of the person. The gross look of me reflected through his eyes brought my self-esteem to the bottom.\nRecently, for some reason, he suddenly apologized to me and changed his attitude, but I know fundamentally, what kind of person he is. The past cannot be undone, and the mistakes committed cannot be covered again.\nIn the end, the insult he had done still remained in me and increased its size. Perhaps, in the future, I might never be able to show a good attitude toward him. How can you be with a person who denies your roots?\n“Hahaha.”\nWhen I let out a blank laugh, the princesses questioned me curiously.\n“I…Princess Rodenov?”\n“Yes! Please speak.”\nAlthough they show an attitude of worrying about me, I could still read their rejection of me from their eyes.\nThe topic of Physis was suddenly brought up, and they only dared to mention his and princess Lobelia’s dance.\nAll of them were pointing invisible knives at me. This was a woman's realm, so there was no place for monsters.\nPhysis's neat and compliant appearance must have played a part. That appearance must have aroused jealousy in them, and it was the attitude that told me that they would approach him after putting me down and taking away my place.\nI couldn’t help but burst out laughing. Perhaps, if they knew his true self, they would hate him too.\nDo they think he will treat them kindly? The person I watched was not like that. He was a cold-blooded person who doesn’t let anyone in his heart. The person who treats people out of necessity and out of interest is, Physis Ortaire.\nHe was like a beautiful poisonous plant. It captivates people with its enchanting appearance and gnaws people from the inside with its poison.\nThe envy and jealousy of those who don’t know him just seemed ridiculous to me.\n* * *\n[Physis's POV]\nThe eyes which were directed at me were not good. The first was because I am a local aristocrat, and the second was because I danced with Princess Lobelia.\nAccording to rumors, Princess Lobelia has never danced with any other men except for her younger brother, 1st Prince Rommel.\nBut since I danced with such a person, it would be natural for them to turn a blind eyes of jealousy toward me.\nIt took a while for the ferocious gazes to come to me, and soon they started completely ignoring me. And it wasn’t long before I heard the voices of those whispering in the distance, they lowered their voices and they seemed to be complacent in thinking that they wouldn’t be heard in such a noisy venue… But having awakened my mana, I could hear their words in great detail.\n“A country boy like him dancing with Her Highness without knowing anything. It can’t be that terrible.”\n“That’s right. But anyway, it’s just dancing. He has to marry that princess, Rodenov without fail, so can’t we just skip that much?”\nSuch childish sounds were gradually increasing in intensity.\n“Yes. He has to live with the monster for the rest of his life, so it would be okay if we could see him dreaming at least once in the center.”\n“I’ve only heard of it, but who would have known she would look so terrifying? If it were me, I would have bitten my tongue and killed myself.”\n“The horns on the top of her head were very attractive. It would be really cool if they were cut and polished. Oh, come to think of it, did I mention that Princess Esteban pays high prices for high-end handicrafts?”\n“She is gathering all kinds of precious handicrafts and if it’s the horn of Princess Rodenov…which is the only one in the world, so their value must be very high.”\nI understand their attitude. The romance they had dreamed of with the princess didn’t come to fruition, and some bastard from the province took the honor. However, the way they expressed their jealousy was too sloppy and dirty.\nThey were insulting Adilun in order to bring me down. Only by doing so can they release their resentment.\nCursing at me didn’t really appeal to me, but cursing at Adilun was different. The person who was hurt by me must not hear that kind of noise, because of me again.\nIsn’t it too much? In an instant, my brother’s words came to mind.\n'Defeat without remorse. I won’t say anything about accidents like that.'\nIt’s been less than an hour since he told me that, but it looks like I’m already in trouble.\nI walked to the front of the guys who said they will just cut off Adilun's horn for crafts. When They saw me they started laughing at me as if they had noticed me too.\nThere was no need for an introduction. What would I do if I knew their names?\nI just laughed with them and grabbed that guy collar who had been yelling about cutting Adilun's horns and whatnot. And threw him into the table.\nBang!\nThe table was smashed, his head hitting the ground intact, and a rather loud sound resonated. And this sound was clear.\nAnd at that moment, silence hung over the venue.\n“What is this!”\nAt the sudden occurrence, the guy who was exchanging low-level jokes about Adilun, by his side shouted in rage. Well, their common sense must have assumed that something like this couldn’t happen.\nBut there was something they needed to know. Because I was a guy who deviated from their common sense.\nI didn’t care about his enraged cry and grabbed him too by the collar.\n“Ouch! Wow! Hey, let me go!”\nNo answer was needed. I made him the same as the one who passed out next to me. I was dissatisfied with the weak material of the table, but the exciting noise it made as it broke, pierced my heart.\nI buried their faces on the ground and leaned over to wake them up, so I slapped them on the cheeks several times, but the sudden shock was so strong that they hardly woke up.\nThis was a bit embarrassing. If they were so weak, I can’t apply for a duel.\nThe chairman instantly became angry, and the knights of the royal guard began to approach me as if they had sensed a change, and the fathers of those who were on the ground began to approach me in bewilderment.\n“What is this!”\nIs he the father of an aristocrat who just fell into the ground? I looked at the old nobleman, whose face had turned red, and was staring at me like he was going to kill me.\nAnd, as expected, my father and older brother, must have noticed this commotion too and with His Excellency, Duke Johannes Rodenov, started approaching me. My older brother seemed unconcerned, as if he thought that what he expected had happened, but my father was different.\n“Physis. Why are you doing that all of a sudden?”\nI smiled as if it was no big deal and told my father.\n“They were talking nonsense, so I stopped them.”\n“What's nonsense, explain it straight!”\nAt the words of the old nobleman, I opened my mouth to tell them what they had said.\n[TL: So guys with this the mass release of the chapters end and now the next chapter will be published on Saturday 😊. ]",

      "content": "“I'm just going to say it, but remember the moment you hear it, there will be no turning back.”\n“It doesn’t matter! If you did it over something trivial, you better be prepared!”\nI already warned that old nobleman, but even so, that old aristocrat seemed to have too much faith in his son, so he replied to me in a determined tone.\n“All right. If that's the case, then I will tell you everything that I heard.”\nIt was unavoidable, either that old man or his son seemed to know me before because they both talked recklessly and tried to pick up the words easily.\nFortunately, Adilun was not here. It was a relief for me to know that she didn’t have to hear these insults from them that I'm about to tell. But the one thing I was worried about was His Excellency, Duke Johannes Rodenov. If he hears this, he probably won’t take it lightly.\n“Yes. He has to live with the monster for the rest of his life, so it would be okay if we could see him dreaming at least once in the center.”\nIt started with these words and I even laughed at the way he mocked me as if sympathizing with me and threw it in the old man's face. And on hearing these words, expressions of bewilderment appeared on his face.\n“I’ve only heard of it, but who would have known she would look so terrifying? If it were me, I would have bitten my tongue and killed myself.”\nAnd as more words continued, His Highness Duke Johannes' face became stern.\n“The horns on the top of her head were very attractive. It would be really cool if they were cut and polished. Oh, come to think of it, did I mention that Princess Esteban pays high prices for high-end handicrafts?”\nAnd when I said the third line, ghat the old man's face turned white.\n“She is gathering all kinds of precious handicrafts and if it’s the horn of Princess Rodenov…which is the only one in the world, so their value must be very high.”\nAnd As I finished my last word, the old nobleman finally shouted at me.\n“You made all this up! There’s no way my son would say something like this! wasn't it all made up by you to drive us into a corner!”\nAt that old man's words, those who were next to him began to sympathize. It seemed that they were probably from the same faction.\n“Right. Is there any evidence? It could simply be a lie you made up to perpetrate violence and cover it up.”\nOne noble from that old nobleman's side said it to me and people nodded at his remark and looked at me. And seeing that Sir Johannes Rodenov also looked at me and asked.\n“Is there any evidence?”\nBut come to think of it, there was no evidence. I just acted out of my anger, I should have something as evidence for a situation like this, but I did it too hastily. At the very least I should have had a magic tool for recording.\nNow, it was a situation that would put me in a corner. I should prepare a little more. I only trusted my older brother’s words and did it openly, but that will only pass justification to him and my family.\nEven if their voices were a bit low, there would have been people around them who would have heard them, but in the end, they were all central nobles. They will take the side of those who have been beaten by me, and will not intend to take my side.\nBecause of a moment of anger, I forgot the basic issue that I had to address. That this is their territory and to speak out in their domain, proper preparation was required.\n\"...\"\nI didn’t think too much about the situation that I said was unavoidable.\n'I'm so stupid\nJust as I was about to shake my head in no, saying that there is no evidence to His Excellency, Sir Johannes, there was a sudden voice that came to us.\n“There is.”\nIt was my brother’s voice.\n“You... Huian Ortaire. do you really have proof? Are you sure?”\n“Yes.”\nMy older brother answered with a firm attitude, and suddenly took out a small marble from his bosom and said.\n“This bead is a magic tool with a recording function. You’re familiar with it, right?. Everyone uses it very often.”\nAs soon as my brother said those words, he activated the magic tool, and at that moment, the words they said began to flow out of the beads.\n-“Yes. He has..” “I’ve only heard...” “The horns on..”\n“There is a possibility that the magic tool was manipulated!”\n“If you wish, I can also confirm whether this magic tool has been tampered with or not. It’s the imperial palace, and Dehanat-nim, the court mage, is also here.”\nNo one expressed objection to my dignified older brother’s words. Only that old man and some aristocrats were pathetically asking for proof.\nAt the request of the old nobleman, my brother went to the court wizard Dehanat Itra in the venue and proved that the magic tool was not tampered with, and at that moment that old nobleman’s face turned white as snow.\n“Yes. I see.”\nHis Excellency Duke Johannes looked at the old nobleman with an expressionless face.\n“What the hell did you teach or son, He should be kind.”\nA noble from behind said that.\nFor the central nobles and the local nobles, undoubtedly, Rodenov was a territory with the strongest military force outside of the capital city.\nThe moment they engage in a war with a Rodenov, his territory will become a mess. So that old nobleman clung to his Excellency Duke Johannes as if he had realized the fact that his word was about to end, but His Excellency declared with a firm attitude.\n“Let everything go according to the procedure. You have insulted the noble ancestors of Rodenov and my daughter...”\nThe old nobleman closed his eyes.\n* * *\n“You Excellency, How do you plan to proceed?”\n“Well, I’ll have to think about it. In my heart, I want to destroy the territories of those rude people with an all-out war, but I can't do that, these bastards...”\nBrother and His Excellency started discussing the way to handle this situation.\n“How about doing it in a duel? Instead of playing casually, the losing side bet everything.”\n“Hmm, a duel between the great warriors… that’s not bad either. You can reap the benefits without shedding pointless blood.”\nThey both decided to go with an informal duel between warriors. It was a duel that have a total of five knights competing in a winner-take-all match, we have the justification, so no matter which way we proceed, saying no or changing conditions was far away, they will not even be able to speak anything about it.\n“Your Excellency...”\n“What is it? Prince Physis.”\n“If it’s possible, can I participate too in this duel?”\n“You?”\n“Yeah. I want to personally condemn those who insulted Adilun.”\nIt was regrettable that I couldn’t beat them more, so I asked His Excellency a favor.\n“Are you sure?”\nHis Excellency looked at me with unreliable eyes. It was understandable because he didn't know about what kind of growth I had achieved.\n“He is reliable, I assure you, Your Excellency. This guy, after three months of training, didn’t lose at all even after sparring with the knights of our family.”\n“If that's the case, then first, I will give you a test, and if you pass it. Then I will allow you to participate.”\nHis Excellency only said that to me because of my older brother's assistance.\n“What kind of test?”\n“You will compete directly against the knight of Rodenov. And if you win, I can trust you.”\n“All right.”\n“Great. Then I’ll tell His Majesty about the great duel and come back. he has been showing interest in this side since earlier, so I have to tell him something first.”\nHis Excellency immediately approached the emperor who was seated on the throne and asked for permission for the great duel.\nWhile all the procedures were going on, the old nobleman, whose name I did not want to know, sat there in despair.\n* * *\n“Hey, how do you know that something like this could happen?”\n“Do you think I instigated you without any preparation? I expected something to happen and moved it in advance.”\n“Have you figured out all of this?”\n“Unlike you, I have some work, so I come to the center many times, so I have already figured out their habits. Those who insulted the princess had a strong contempt for the local nobles from before. Moreover, among the young men belonging to the central nobles, there are few young men who do not harbor feelings of longing for Her Highness, Princess Lobelia, so of course I thought this was the case.”\n“Thank you for helping me. I did it without thinking and almost got into trouble.”\n“This is why I did it in the first place, believing in your ability to act and knowing that if it's you, you would grab someone and beat them up. And at least one guy needed an example, so that’s good. Well done anyway. With this, we can completely steal the territory of that central nobleman.”\nAfter saying that, my brother laughed evilly.\n“That's harsh.”\n“Hahaha, that is true.”\n\"Hey I want to ask something, do you believe I can win?\"\n“Win? No... Of course, you will win. You will probably be stronger than me by the time the great duel begins. You crazy guy It was a waste of such talent that you didn't practice”\n“What… Aren’t you glad I'm doing it now?”\n“It’s not like that either. Tsk. Anyway, from now on, even if you have an accident, I won’t be able to help you every time.”\n“I won’t do it without thinking, so don’t worry.”\n“I guess so. Anyway, during the duel between the great warriors, it’s a splendid mess. You’ve been putting shit on the family’s name, so now try to raise the family’s status.”\n“Alright, brother.”",

      "content": "The atmosphere was quite friendly. Except for me, of course. I was passing the time by just responding appropriately to their words because I was tired.\nI was trying to avoid any kind of confrontation because I would be targeted here in that case. But at that moment, someone’s question rang in my ear.\n“Princess Rodenov. I have a question for you. Is Prince Physis Ortaire always that kind?”\nThe intention of asking such a question out of the blue must be because she thinks that Physis can’t be kind to a monster like me.\nWell, I really don't know the reason for her asking that question, however, judging from the clear jealousy in her eyes, it seems that my prediction was correct.\nIndeed, after looking at her face again, I remembered that she was one of the princesses who blushed when she told Physis earlier that he was handsome.\nHow should I answer?\nThe trouble didn’t last long, because I was in a position to act. I wanted to break their illusions by answering the truth, but I didn’t want to tell them about Physis and me, and I didn’t want to break the alliance that Ortaire and Rodenov were trying to carry on with my petty anger. So It was impossible.\n“Yes, he is always kind.”\nRemembering his recent attitude, I replied.\nCertainly, his attitude towards me has been very kind lately, probably due to pressure from his family.\n“Wow, really? Can you be specific? I’m really curious about what happens between the two of you on a regular basis!”\nWhat kind of answer does this woman want? I was very curious about her intentions, but I decided to live up to that expectation.\nYes. There is no need to break this innocent girl’s dream, whatever it is, it’s none of my business.\n“I do not know. When I stopped by Enassa for this National Foundation Day, he moved one step ahead of me and escorted me… When I attended this ball, he even held my hand when I was trembling involuntarily.”\nOf course, each time I had to suppress the anger that was rising.\n“Also, when Physis smiles, his eyes fold slightly, and he doesn’t know how cool that is.”\nAfter hearing my answer, the princess’s expression became like a girl in a dream. I’m not sure, but she’s probably drawing a rather romantic situation by assigning my anecdote to herself.\nAnd that expression soon began to harden little by little, eventually, she will realize the reality. The one next to him is not her, but I am, a monster. Perhaps inside that woman, she is determined to save Physis from a monster like me.\nOops. If you knew his true identity, you would thank god for not being at my place.\nIt would be better to leave the dream just a dream.\nWherever you are, try your best.\nAt that moment, Princess Lobelia spoke to all of us.\n“Now, since we talked a lot with each other, shall we go back to the venue soon? The prom isn’t over yet. You can dance with the people you want, and you can dream of romance with someone you like. With such expectations, let’s enjoy today.”\n“Yes, Your Highness the princess.”\n----------------\nWhen I returned to the venue, the venue was somehow cluttered.\nDid something happen earlier when we were not here?\nI saw my father, who seemed a little angry.\n“Father?”\n“Ah, Adilun, you are here.”\n“Has anything happened? why this is all messed up and cluttered...”\nAt that moment, my father thought about something and told me.\n“To you tell the truth... We ended up having a great duel.”\n“Yes!?”\nA Greate Duel, but why, I was confused so I asked in response.\n“What the hell happened?”\n“There were some people who dared to insult you. Those who used some extremely ugly words that I couldn’t even bear to say... Thinking about it again makes me angry. The battle between the clan and the great warrior to which they belonged to now going to happen.”\n“Ahh.”\nYes. I could roughly guess the level of insult and ugly words they used for me by seeing my father's angry expression. There must have been using the words like a monster or something.\nI calmed down my expression and asked my father with a firm face.\n“Which family is it?”\n“Aiden.”\n“Aiden. Are you talking about Aiden from the central nobles? Recently, it is said that they are increasing the tax by allying with the merchants...”\n“Accurate.”\n“Since it was me who was insulted, we must have the right to proceed with the great duel. And the winner takes all....”\n“Yes. No matter how much I feel anger towards Aiden, there is nothing wrong with the people living in it. So I'm not taking any money as an apology or compensation.”\n“Understood. Then, what are you planning to buy at the great duel, father?”\n“Everything.”\nMy father’s eyes were cold. Looking at the scene, I could guess that my father was very angry. How long has it been since I saw my father this angry?\n“When is the schedule?”\n“A month later. I plan to notify the Knights immediately after the National Foundation Day.”\n“I see.”\n“By the way, Adilun.”\n“Yes.”\n“Physis decided to participate in the duel.”\n“... ...Yes?”\nWhat the hell is this, what is he even thinking?\n“What do you mean by that? Why is he in the duel...?”\n“It was Physis who found those who insulted you in the first place. And then he pinned them to the ground right away. So, next month, if he passes my test, I plan to send him to the duel as well.”\nConfusion overtook me in an instant. Directly punishing those who insulted me, and even going to a duel with great warriors? why?\nThe great duel was a life-threatening place. Taking the life of the loser in a duel is the right of the winner. Going to a place like that meant risking your life.\nAs far as I know, his strength was poor. It seems like he’s been training quite a bit lately, and his physique has grown quite a bit, but it doesn’t seem like he is right to duel directly with the knights...\nDid he really act for me? Wasn’t it simply because of family pressure to be nice to me?\nMy head got complicated. Is he sincerely repenting for his mistakes? Or is he just pretending to sympathize, not wanting to hear that his fiancée is a monster?\nI don’t know. Really, I don’t know. Why?\nInvoluntarily, I began to look around. Not far away, he was talking to his brother about something.\nI move my steps and approach him, and he smiles at me with a slightly bitter but welcoming smile.\nWhy are you making this face?\nDon't you hate me?\nI don’t know if that expression was sincere or if it was because of his promise to do an act with me.\nIt would have been nice if there was at least some kind of magic that could understand people’s minds. If that were the case, I wouldn’t have to worry so much.\nThen suddenly he tells me.\n“Adilun? what happened? Do you need something?”\nI grabbed his arm and whispered.\n“Come, talk to me for a minute.”\nHe seemed flustered but was meekly drawn to me.\nIs there a place where the two of us can talk quietly?\nTerrace. Yes, the terrace would be nice.\nThere was no one on the terrace. Maybe it’s because it’s still too early for young nobles to have a tryst. The view through the open windows was too beautiful.\nContrary to the beautiful scenery, I felt like I was stuck in a gutter.\n“Why did you do that?”\n“Yes?”\nHe looked at me with a bewildered expression, but I repeated what I said.\n“Why did you want to participate in the great duel? Did you have a reason for that?”\n“Yes. Because I'm angry.”\nI took care of my embarrassment and said to him with a calm expression.\n“Why are you angry?”\n“Because they insulted you.”\n“Lie.”\n“... ....”\nWhen I say that it is a lie, his expression twists miserably. Why, why are you making that face? Isn’t that the expression I should rather have when I’m really miserable and rotten?\nAnger surged through my head.\n“I don’t know why you are doing this now. Rather, it was like that from the first time we met. Why are you confusing me so much? Are you angry that they insulted me? So, then, you insulted me too? Weren’t you mad at yourself too then?”\n“... ...”\nHe hung his head and said nothing. I still shouted at him with anger.\n“Answer me! If you hate me so much, why are you acting like this? Did your family pressure you?”\n* * *\n[Physis's POV]\nIn front of my eyes, she was angry. In this situation, what should I do to get rid of her anger? How can my sincerity reach her?\nAs she said, I don’t know. However, there is only one thing I have to say now.\n“I don’t hate you anymore. I have abandoned all of my hatred and contempt for you. I didn’t know why I'm changing, and I don’t know either. I just wanted to do that.”\nA choking sound was heard.\n“Lie...”\nIs it my imagination that her pitiful trembling voice sounds overly sad?\n“I’ve said it before, don’t forgive me, and that is still true. Don’t forgive me but you just need to be happy. I will never insult you in the future. I will not say anything or shamelessly ask for your trust.”\nAt that moment, her expression twisted sadly.\n“Why, why come now? why! I lost my pride because of you, and I lost the me I loved because of you! But now, if you show that attitude, what are you going to do to me… I can’t think of myself as a person anymore. I’m just a monster. But since you, who made me like that, say those words, it’s disgusting, I hate you...”\nThere was a sense of misery and humiliation in her words, that’s what caused by me because I was the one who broke her self-esteem, which was higher than anyone else’s.\n“I’m sorry…”\nAll I could do was make this pitiful apology. Anything else I say will only hurt her.\nHearing my apology, she suddenly raised her head and looked at me. As if revealing my sins intact, the golden eyes shone most brilliantly and illuminated me.\n“Do you know what I hate the most?”\n“I do not know.”\nShe nodded as if it were natural for me to shake my head.\n“It must be so. So let me tell you. What I hate most is... ...My heart wants to believe that you have changed even when we are in such a situation.”\nThis time I was out of breath. Does she still have hope for me who insulted her so much?\n“Even though I hate myself so much, I can’t let go of this pitiful hope… ….I won’t be able to endure it if I don’t even have the hope of living happily with a companion who will walk with me.”\nAt that moment, she brought out some of the words that she had been hiding in her heart.\nThat would have been her last hope. I couldn’t bear to throw it away in the rotting misery.\n“... ...Yes.”\n“Therefore… …Last, at last, I will not trust you in the future, and I do not intend to forgive you easily. But if you continue to honor me. And if that’s how you behave consistently... ...I will trust you.”\nThat’s how she looks at me with a ray of hope in her misery. An ultimatum fell to me.",

      "content": "“Alright.”\nShe said to me that she will trust me, which means the situation is not completely hopeless.\n'Haa, This is my last chance, and I will definitely use it well'\nI laughed self-deprecatingly, then spoke to her again.\n“From now on, I will prove it to you with my actions.”\nI said that and took Adilun’s hand and led her to the ballroom. She was drawn to me with a very weak appearance as if she was sorting out her confused emotions.\nIn the ballroom, the dancing was still going on, I didn’t want to be here because I felt disgusted by the sight of each of them hiding their ugliness and standing proudly under the light, because it was like seeing my former self in them.\n“What do you want to do?”\n“… …I want to rest. Will you take me?”\nWith a weak voice, she asked me.\n“Yes.”\nI led her to her room and told her while walking.\n“I heard that there is a hunting competition starting tomorrow.”\n“Eww...”\nShe trembled with a disgusted look on her face.\n“Why is that?”\n“I'm tired just by hearing about it. What should I do?”\n“You probably won’t go to the hunt. I don’t know the details, but women just gather and talk… It is said that it is mostly men who actually do the hunting.”\n“Haaa...”\nAdilun’s expression changed as if she was screaming in desperation and despair. And I could easily guess why. It must be that she doesn’t even want to be involved in the stories and gossips of the princesses.\n“Are you okay?”\n“No. Not okay at all. Phew…”\n“Then, why don’t you say you’re not feeling well and take a break?”\n“Nope. I can’t do that, and definitely not in an imperial event.”\n“Then… …How about going to hunt together?”\nAt my words, Adilun instantly raised her head and asked me.\n“Going together?”\n“Yes. I’ve heard that it doesn’t matter that even female nobles participate in hunting competitions if they want to.”\n“Aha.”\nAs if realizing something, Adilun looked at me and said.\n“Yes. Let's go together. I would rather be with you than spend all day with the princesses who keep asking me about you.”\n“Do the princesses ask about me?”\n“Yes. They were very interested in you because of your good looks.”\n“Is that true?”\n“Yes. To be honest, they ask me about you to the point of being very tired.”\n“This...”\nTo be honest, it was quite embarrassing, so I didn't say anything but she looked at me with a puzzled face and said.\n“I have no idea what you are thinking about. It’s not your fault that you’re good-looking. But... ...Don’t go around and be bewitched by those innocent princesses. I have no intention of getting involved in a love affair.”\n“I will keep that in mind.”\n“By the way, do you have any experience in hunting?”\n“In hunting… …I do not know. I think it’s hard to say that I can very well. But I don't think I'm too bad.”\n“I see. Oh, we arrived at my room, I’ll go in now, and you should rest too.”\n“Rest well, Adilun.”\nAfter saying that, when I was about to leave, I suddenly felt like someone grabbing the hem of my clothes.\n“Adilun?”\n“Thank you for listening to my heart without laughing. At least I should say thank you for this. And don’t forget what I said earlier. Really, this is the last time. The last chance I can give you.”\nSomehow, I thought she was cute, and I laughed spontaneously and told her.\n“Of course, I will. I will work hard, Adilun.”\n“… …What are you laughing at anyway, you should go to rest now too.”\nFeeling a bit embarrassed, she said that and quickly opened the door and hid behind it.\nLooking at that figure, and thinking she really is cute, I turned my back and started going to my room. While walking I was lost in thought.\nShe is too kind. To give me, who trampled her on her pride for no reason, a chance to correct my mistakes again, was something really hard to do for anyone. It's like letting her guard down again in front of old danger.\nShe also told me that she wants to walk a happy life with me. The fragments of hope she expressed were terribly heavy. Can I really do it?\nI feel a little afraid. Do I deserve it? Even if I know I'm changed because of my previous life, but that old Physis was also me. All the things I did to her in the past year were by no means less than the people who insulted her at the venue.\nI was not this weak In my previous life, even at the moment of facing death, I wasn’t so afraid.\nI shouldn’t be like this.\nI forcibly suppressed my fearful heart, made up my mind, and recalled a single resolution in my heart. The resolution of making Adilun happy.\nThe reason I was able to hold such a determination in my heart is probably possible because I am facing her in person now, unlike in my previous life, where I only faced her in text.\nYou don’t know how happy I am for that fact alone.\nPerhaps this feeling would not be conveyed to Adilun for the rest of my life. But it didn’t matter.\nI am satisfied with being able to witness her life and being able to face the hardships she is about to go through together.\nAdilun, I will surely live for your happiness.\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\nThe moment I closed the door and entered, I lay down on the bed. And…\nI kicked the blanket with my feet.\n“OMG!!”\nFeeling confused, I even said something that didn’t have to be said.\n“What can I believe in him...”\nMy face was hot. What kind of embarrassing things am I talking about? On the subject of saying that I don’t trust him that much.\nBut even so, my inside was relieved. As I brushed off the emotions that had been lingering on me, my heart, which felt as if a heavy stone had been placed on it, became much lighter.\nIt was embarrassing to say, but it was what I wanted to say the most. Saying that I want to be with a companion who respects me.\nI won’t be able to trust him easily in the future, but if Physis really changes, I can give him a last chance.\nWhat should I do?\nI don’t know. But my feeling is not that sad or painful, rather… …they are, hopeful.\nAlso, I would be lying if I said that I honestly did not feel happy when I heard that it was he who punished those who insulted me.\nI thought he just hated me...\nNo. I don’t know yet.\n'Don’t trust him easily.'\nI tried to calm my excitement. Nothing was certain yet. It could have been that he was simply putting on a mask and acting, or maybe he was doing that to play with me.\nBecause he was someone I couldn’t understand, and he hated me terribly. I should not give my faith easily.\nHave hope, but don’t expect too much from that hope, and become the food of hope yourself.\nIf that happens and hope turns to despair, I will lose myself.\nAfter sorting out all the confusing emotions I felt today, I couldn’t help but think about the hunting competition tomorrow.\nHunting competition… …Would it be right to just move with Physis?\nOriginally, I thought of moving with Physis. However, on second thought, it seemed that I should not go.\nBecause, if I go, it might get in the way. Although I can use magic, but my stamina is not that good.\nYes. In fact, wasn’t the reason why I was tempted to move with him in order to get away from the princesses and the battle of spirits?\nHim who promised not to be swayed by other girls, should I use this opportunity to test him?\nNo. I’m not going to do anything to test Physis, because I promised to have faith in him and I should not be dishonest with my promise.\n...And I should not fear those princesses as well.\nI have to do my job if I'm going to be the head of Rodenov in the future, I can’t avoid these trivial things.\n'Yes. Adilun. Let’s face it.'\n* * *\n[Physis's POV]\nSoon, it was the beginning of the hunting competition.\nEach of the princesses wore a shy smile and tied handkerchiefs to the wrists of the knights, and the knights aimed for victory with determined expressions.\nIt was the same for me too.\nThis morning, Adilun said to me.\n“You asked to move together yesterday, but now that I think about it again, I don’t think I should go with you.”\n“What’s the problem? Did I do something wrong?”\n“No. It’s not like that. I just… … I don’t want to run away.”\nOh, I understood Adilun's words at once. A battle of spirits could happen between princesses. Even though she could get away from all those evil intentions, she didn’t make that choice and would face it.\n“All right. Now that you made your decision, I must work hard too.”\n“Yes.”\nAfter saying that, Adilun hesitantly took something out of her arms and grabbed my hand.\n“Adilun?”\n“Stay still for a moment.”\n'No way.'\nShe said to me while tying a handkerchief engraved with a noble blue-white dragon around my wrist.\n“Just don’t get hurt...”\n“Yes. I will never get hurt. Do not worry.”\n“Don’t get me wrong. In my heart, I want you to get hurt badly, but… …Because you have to participate in the great duel that's why I....”\n“Hahaha. I will keep that in mind.”\nIt seemed that the ears of Adilun, who turned her head and spoke, turned a little red.\n[T/N: Don't forget to check out our new series – The Mad Tycoon Of Rome – by DemonSlayer: https://www.readingpia.me/series/the-mad-tycoon-of-rome",

      "content": "It was time for the hunting competition to start, so everyone was excited but the Emperor sat leisurely with a joyful smile as if he was simply gonna watch a mundane competition.\nOriginally, I heard that he was very active in hunting competitions, but why is he not participating this time?\nHmm, I really don't know...\nBefore the start of the hunting competition, Lobelia said to everyone.\n“It is a very nice day. The day is sunny but not too hot, so it is a very suitable day for hunting competition.\n“For the sake of the princesses you serve, and for the sake of the lord, or for your family… …The reasons may be different, but there is one common purpose for all of you who are standing here now. Championship.\n“This hunting competition may be a bit difficult. Besides simply catching a lot of animals for high scores, or trying to catch a single animal with a high score can be quite dangerous.\n“Of course, for safety reasons, I released them in a fairly deep place in the hunting ground… …But please be careful. If you do something dangerous for high scores, a normal person could lose their life here.”\nSome of the nobles were nervous at Lobelia’s words. It could have been that they were intimidated by the word dangerous, or they could have been estimating their reputation that would rise if they hunted a dangerous one.\n“But you are the noble warriors of this mighty Enadeims. I believe that such threats can be easily overcome. In this hunting competition, which also includes quite a few knights, I hope you will show off your skills to the fullest. Good luck.”\nAs soon as Lobelia’s words were finished, the sharp howling of hounds was heard, and the hunting competition began.\n“Are you going?”\nMy brother asked me.\n“Yeah. Aren’t you participating in the contest?”\n“It's annoying. I’m not very interested in it, and I don’t even have a princess I like, so what will I be doing? You work hard. But Where is your hound, by the way?”\n“I don’t really need a hound. Only a horse will suffice.”\n“Is that so..., Okay do your best.”\n“Yes.”\nI left my older brother behind and immediately drove the horse toward the hunting ground.\nThere were nobles who brought their own hounds, but I didn’t really need them. I can find my target through mana senses.\nThey give us a bow for the hunt. I’ve used bow quite a few times in my past life, but I don’t think I’ve ever shot one in my current life. But it didn’t matter, because I was confident in whatever I can do with my body.\nAs I rode and ran moderately, I saw the appearance of the prey captured in my eyes. Without hesitation, I raised my bow, drew the string, and let go.\nTeeing!\nThere was a light crackling sound, the sound of cutting through the wind, and the sound of something falling.\nPerhaps thanks to my experience in my previous life, there was no problem handling the bow.\nSatisfied, I activated my mana senses again. It was because there could be prey nearby.\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\nThe hunting competition had begun.\nNow, the princesses only had to wait for the people who would offer their hunt to them.\nGradually, it was very friendly to see people who were close gather and talk.\nEven so, seeing that they implicitly say that their own knight is superior, it must be that they also want their knight to play an active part in the hunting competition.\nSuddenly, I started to have doubts, will Physis be good at hunting? As far as I can remember, I had never heard of him hunting.\nWell, I didn’t really want his performance, I just wanted the hunting tournament to end quickly.\nBecause…\n“Princess Rodenov, what kind of animal would you like Prince Ortaire to catch?”\n“I don’t really want anything. It’s the first time I’ve ever been in a hunting competition hosted by the imperial family, so I’m in a state where I don’t even know what it is. I don’t even know what kind of prey there is.”\n“I heard that in this tournament, quite rare animals and even dangerous but beautiful monsters are released. The dangerous monster that Her Highness talked about earlier is probably that monster. I’ve heard that it has beautiful hair that glows in the moonlight…”\nAs soon as the princess finished talking excitedly about what kind of animals or monsters were in this hunting competition, the princess next to her threw a word at me with a jealous attitude.\n“Anyway, I’m very envious of Princess Rodenov.”\n“Me?”\nWhat kind of nonsense is this again? Why are you envious of me?\n“Yeah. I also have a fiancé because of an arranged marriage… …But he’s a very bad match for me.”\n“Ah...”\nHer attitude was understandable. She was bound by an arranged marriage but she must have become jealous when she saw Physis being kind to me.\nMoreover, even the beautiful appearance of Physis must have played an important part too.\nAfter all, people seem to have a habit of thinking and fantasizing about things that are not theirs.\nOf course, Physis has only recently been kind to me, but what would she say if I brought him from a year ago right in front of her?\nIt became funny for some reason, but I endured it and looked at her with a pitiful gaze. Yes, I know that feeling well.\n“Oops… …must be hard I fully understand that feeling.”\n“You understand?”\nBut as soon as I said that, the nameless princess reacted sharply to me. I expected such a reaction, so I wasn’t particularly taken aback, but the expressions of the princesses around me began to stiffen.\nIt seems that she was not a princess with a very good reputation from the beginning. It must have been that she had been having trouble with her fiancé.\nHowever, judging from the fact that no one ever said it out of their mouth, she seemed to be the daughter of a well-ranked family.\n“Yes. I didn’t get along very well with Physis either.”\n“Yes? But you both look very friendly?”\n“The day Physis and I first met me, we both hated each other so much. Because I don’t like the situation itself of an arranged marriage.”\nAlthough it’s a little relieved now, to be precise, Physis initially hated me one-sidedly.\n“But if you give each other a chance and talk… …It might get a little better. Because I did. Don’t just try to avoid the parts that don’t fit each other, let’s talk about it.”\n“Conversation...”\nIt’s a simple method above all else, but it’s not easy to find a person’s true intentions. Because you need the courage to tell your feelings to others first, and sometimes you have to endure shame too.\nAbout the relationship between me and Physis?\nIt was not a relationship that could be solved through the conversation as I said.\nThe next step was necessary. The next step of action.\nEven though I didn’t know what would happen to our relationship after the stage of action, one thing was certain. At least it will be better than now.\nAt my words, the nameless princess nodded with a slightly worried expression. She seemed to suspect that that alone could solve the relationship, so I added one more word.\n“After talking, if you are dissatisfied with each other’s behavior, it would be good to actively correct it.”\n“… …I see.”\nIn the eyes of the princess who reluctantly nodded, there was no longer any jealousy.\n* * *\n[Physis's POV]\n“Where is this?”\nI was only engrossed in catching prey, and I got lost. It was because I was preoccupied with hunting prey that seemed precious.\nBefore I knew it, the carcasses of prey were dangling from my horse. Among them, by far, the prey with the highest score would be a fox with silver fur.\nI didn’t think Adilun would be happy with this, but as long as I participated in the hunting competition, I would have to pay for the handkerchief she gave me by achieving more than a certain level.\n“For now… …Should I go back the way I came, or should I look for the most dangerous guy?”\nIn fact, it seemed like I had already secured a lot of points, so I didn’t have to catch anything more, but hunting had a strange charm, so I wanted to enjoy it a little more.\nNow that this was the case, should I try to catch it?\nI’d love to do it if I can.\nI expanded my senses. Quite a lot of things were caught in my senses, but since there was no one that felt particularly strong, it didn’t seem like they were around here.\nKeeping my senses open, I mounted my horse again and headed deeper into the hunting grounds. Since as Lobelia said that they are in the depths, something will come out if I just go into the depths.",

      "content": "competition(2)In the middle of the hunting competition, inside the forest, Alan Aiden was on horseback with his head bowed, and he was swearing.\n“Damn it, damn you, Physis Ortaire and Rodenov....!”\nThe swear words that he spat out were tinged with deep anger and hatred. After insulting Adilun and being beaten by Physis, no one around him tried to come to him and offer help in their fight for the territory. It was as if they were buried in an aristocratic society.\n'I couldn’t even find someone to help me with a great duel because those Rodenov and Ortaire combined, had the strongest power among all the nobles within the empire.'\nCentral nobles were the ones who enjoyed watching other people’s ruin, so they just happily laughed at Alan.\n‘It’s crazy. I should have done that in an undetected place.’\n‘How can I be so stupid?’\n‘I recognized it from the time I hung out with the lowly merchants. I did nothing wrong, and What does that Physis, a man without dignity believe in and be so proud of?’\nA strong bond of central nobles, nothing like that actually existed. It was a relationship where everyone used each other for their own needs.\nBecause of that, the only thing left in front of Alan Aiden was the abyss called the great duel with Rodenov, so that's why he was cursing Physis and all the local nobles.\nThe knights of Rodenov are notorious for their ruthlessness. Alan never thought that the knights of his territory would defeat those who had been fighting monsters all their life.\n‘Yes, if I'm going to die anyway… … I will just not die simply. Yes, I will do this...’\nHe thought about shooting a crossbow at Princess Rodenov, Adilun, but that was already impossible.\nThe place where the princesses were staying was guarded by knights, so his head will fly off as soon as he showed strange behavior. In other words, it was impossible to shoot a crossbow.\n'No that's not gonna work, hmm so, what should I do?'\nAlan began to think of a way. which can harm Adilun or her family.\n‘Damn it. If I’d been a little more careful with my surroundings, I’d just be hunting… not worrying about these things…!’\nAlan was a fan of hunting. If it hadn’t been for this, he would have enjoyed the hunt, but he just lingered and pondered over and over again in the forest.\nBut, suddenly, in his mind, what Lobelia had said before the hunting competition started to come.\n[This hunting competition may be a bit difficult. Besides simply catching a lot of animals for high scores, or trying to catch the single animal with the highest score can be quite dangerous.]\n‘If it’s a dangerous game… …They probably used a monster in it too. In particular, there are only a few knights participating in the hunting competition, but there’s no way they’d give a high score with only animals.’\nWhat if I somehow find the monster and lure it to Princess Rodenov? What if I attack Princess Rodenov with an arrow while everyone’s eyes are on that monster?\nBut he soon shook his head.\n‘No. She said they were definitely deep in the forest. And on top of that, it’s hard to lure it with my skills. I will definitely die before I lure him and drag it to the place where the princesses are located.’\nHe continued to hover around the hunting ground.\nWhile he was circling the hunting ground and shooting arrows at appropriate prey as a way to vent his anger, a unique and small animal caught his eye.\n‘What is that?’\nIt was the first time he was seeing an animal like this but since it was an event for the imperial family, there was nothing strange about having a unique animal in it, but the shape of that animal was too unusual.\nIt looked like a wolf cub with many eyes, its fur shone with gold, but its eyes were dark and muddy as the abyss. Also, there was a small horn attached to what appeared to be a head, but it never looked like an ordinary animal.\n‘It’s a monster. But it's very small, is it a baby?’\nAnd the moment he guessed that it was a child of a monster, a plan popped into Alan’s head.\n‘There’s a high possibility of having a child of a monster in the hunting ground. If I secure this guy… …It is not difficult to lure the big mother too. Monstervalues their children, so they will definitely do everything they can to find them. Wolf-type monsters are especially sensitive to the smell of their cubs’ blood. She will definitelycome looking for it no matter how far it is.’\nAfter thinking thus far, he swiftly fired his crossbow at the babymonster. Although Alan had nothing else to offer, his hunting skills were still at a usable level.\nSwish!\nThe arrow from the crossbow flew ferociously and pierced into the body of the baby monster.\n‘Done…!’\nHe immediately rode the horse and secured the baby monster. The bleeding monster whimpered pathetically, but Alan didn’t care at all and rather dripped the monster’s blood onto the road little by little for the mother to discover it.\n* * *",

      "content": "Just in case, I looked back and saw a ferocious, golden wolf-type monster bigger than a bear running in front of me.\nI momentarily got off the horse and took a defensive stance, but the guy [Alan Aiden] didn’t even pay attention to me and ran ahead, ignoring me.\nApparently, my prediction was correct. He [Alan Aiden] must be looking for this baby monster's mother. I immediately mounted the horse again and chased after him.\nHowever, the distance never narrowed. It was because the speed he showed was not normal.\nSomehow I didn’t have a good feeling. If the guy who deliberately let go of the baby monster was the guy who was beaten by me, he must be plotting something.\nEven if it was a baby monster, if he caught it, it would be immediately reflected in his score, but there must be a reason why he let go of the monster, even giving it up.\nI drove the horse at the fastest speed and chased the monster.\n'Please, I hope nothing goes wrong.'\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\nWhen Aristata Glosuna got away from us, time passed gradually. Suddenly, a knight approached Princess Lobelia and said.\n“Your Highness the Princess.”\n“What happened?”\n“I think we should start moving slowly. And other princesses including princess Randnov, should move too.”\n“Ah. Is it already over? Then it seems that it is time for us to go too. Right, Adilun?”\n“Yes. Your Highness the Princess. But, may I know what’s going on?”\n“It’s nothing. Now that the hunting tournament is almost over, They are telling us to join the other nobles. I think you don’t know it because it’s the first time you are in a hunting competition, but there are many people who get lost in this hunting ground every year.”\n“If there are people who get lost… ...It must be a situation where the knights cannot escort us even to find them.”\n“Yes. Those who get lost in their greed for scoring more may be in danger, so at the end of the hunting competition, there are always knights looking for them. If we don’t move from now on, some people will come back later to find us too.”\n“All right. Then should we move now?”\n“Yes. The knights seem to be ready to move, so we just have to go back to where we met earlier.”\nAfter those words, Princess Lobelia began to call the princesses together. The princesses must have already had this kind of experience, and they quickly followed the princess’s instructions.\nLooking around, the knights seemed to have already entered the hunting ground, and not a single one appeared.\nA person who is lost… …Wouldn’t Physis come back with the help of those knights?\nHe seemed like a person who had never done hunting before, so it was quite possible, so I laughed without knowing. After all, Physis started 3 months ago and apparently had never used mana before.\nIf Physis came back like that, I thought it would be worth watching.\nAs I was about to move my feet thinking that, the surroundings suddenly became noisy.\nI looked up to see what was going on, and I saw a little wolf with golden fur wounded and surrounded by the princesses.\nThe princesses let out a continuous sigh at the pitiful wolf and asked if it could be cured.\nHe was cute and was equally dangerous: His appearance is somehow contradictory and amusing, or am I the only one who thinks that?\nThe princesses caught that animal right away.\nWell, seeing it with my own eyes made me feel pitiful. The wounded golden wolf must have looked cute enough in the eyes of the princesses.\nHowever, upon closer examination of the wolf, I could see small horns on its head.\nThe moment I saw the horns, I realized that this wolf was not just an ordinary wolf.\nA wolf with horns?\nNormal wolves, of course, do not have horns. And that’s not all. I felt the dark, muddy torrent of mana flowing through his body. Simple wolves do not harbor such mana. Because they are beings derived from nature, animals are weak but possess pure mana.\nIf that wolf was a normal animal, there was no way it would hold such a muddy mana.\nNot even knowing that fact, the princesses made a fuss and tried to cure the wolf.\nIn particular, it was surprisingly Princess Aristata who took the lead. She actively blocked the part where the blood flowed from the wolf’s body, and asked if there was anyone around who used magic to cure the wolf.\n“Does anyone know how to use healing magic?”\nI spoke to her who was hastily asking questions.\n“Stop it.”\nAt my firm words, Princess Aristata said in doubt.\n“What do you mean?”\n“That wolf is a monster. Look at the horns on top of his head. It’s because it's hurt right now, but the moment It gets better, It will try to hurt you.”\n“Princess Rodenov, how can you be so sure that, this wolf is a monster?”\n“It’s because I can recognize the monsters just by looking at them. There are many monsters in the north. In particular, normal wolves do not have horns on their heads, and the waves of mana that circulate inside their bodies are not muddy.”\n“It doesn’t matter. Can this wolf hurt other people now?”\n“It is impossible to tame monsters with human hands. Because their nature is that they hate all living things.”\n“… …How can you be sure of that? If the environment changes, wouldn’t the monsters also change?”\nIn a somewhat stubborn attitude, the stuffiness comes over.\nThat woman knows nothing. It must be because it just looks cute to the naked eye.\n“There are many monsters in the North.”\nAt my sudden words, her expression casts a question. I didn’t care and continued talking.\n“We have tried many times. I thought that if I tamed the monsters, I might be able to reduce the sacrifices of the northern part. But...\n“...The results were all failures. The monsters in the current situation were no different. That’s the monster’s nature. If that baby monster grows up, it will probably bite someone’s neck.”\n“Still...”\n“If you insist on that much, I have nothing more to say.”\nDespite my stubborn attitude, her dissatisfaction is clearly visible.\nWell, I understood her reaction. I was a little angry, but it’s a mistake that people who haven’t actually experienced the threat of monsters make.\nI’m the only one who can use healing magic anyway, so if I leave it alone, that young monster will die.\nI don’t have to fight and get tired.\nFeeling that way, the moment I looked at Princess Lobelia, I could see that her expression was full of embarrassment. I definitely thought she would sort this situation out.\n“No way.”\n“Your Highness the Princess? What are you doing?”\n“There must have been no cubs in the first place?”\n“… …Yes?”\n“When I first brought the monster deep into the hunting ground, the monster wasn’t pregnant. But can how there be a child monster this quickly...?”\n“Didn’t you put both of them in the depths of the hunting ground?”\n“Yeah. Obviously. If I had known they had babies, I would never have put them in. But why all of a sudden...”\nWatching her bewildered expression, I sensed something was wrong.\nA baby monster just born?\nClearly, monsters are beings that value their offspring.\nIn particular, newly born baby monsters are the first priority for monsters to protect.\nIf the pup they treasure so much disappears, they will surely come looking for it. Especially since the calf was bleeding from the wound… …There was a high possibility that the mother would come after smelling the scent of blood.\nAnd above all, the situation in which the knights who guarded us entered the hunting ground to finish the hunting competition.\nIn other words, there were no knights to escort the princesses here.\nHaving reached that point, I quickly shouted.\n“Leave the baby and run away!”\nThe princesses were startled by my sudden cry. Even in the midst of that, Princess Aristata stubbornly held the baby monster in her arms and did not let go.\nThat moment.\nKhuhuong–!\nSuddenly, a ferocious roar is heard… …A huge golden monster with huge horns on its head jumped out.\n“Kyaaah!”\nI heard the screams of the princesses who saw it.\nAs soon as I saw it, I raised my mana.\nDamn.\nI clicked my tongue and looked at it, fully prepared to use my magic at any time.\nAs if it didn’t care about me raising my mana, it glared at Princess Aristata, who was holding its child in her arms, with dark flesh in her eyes.\nPrincess Aristata sat down on the ground as if her strength for living was exhausted, and only showed a pale expression on her face.\nAfter that brief moment of time passed, it immediately jumped at Princess Aristata, and at that moment, my protective magic spread in front of Princess Aristata.\n\"Wow!\"\nHis charge was so strong that my strong protection magic was shaken. It continued to ram its head into the protective magic.\nI moved the mana while maintaining the protection magic. In an instant, mana flowed along the ground and huge spikes rose from the ground.\n- Caang!\nHowever, perhaps that monster had considerable resistance to magic, even the spear of the earth that contained mana was deflected. I clicked my tongue and prepared the magic again.\nIf that protection magic were to break through, Princess Aristata would be eaten alive.\nBecause monsters don’t forgive those who stole their offspring.\nOther attack magic didn’t work on him either.\nHow the hell would the imperial family have thought of burying such a monster in the depths of the hunting ground?\nConfusion and anger ran down my spine, and I immediately threw all my energy into protective magic.\nIf it had turned its head and aimed at other princesses, it would have been a bigger problem, but it was fortunate that its eyes only stayed on Princess Aristata.\nConcentrating all my mana on protection magic, I couldn’t use magic to transmit this commotion to other places, so I called out to the princesses.\n“Someone call a knight quickly! It’s a monster with resistance to magic, so it’s hard to hit directly with my magic!\"\nAt my voice, the other princesses were just looking at the monster with eyes full of fear, perhaps in a state of panic thinking that if they moved, they would be the ones being targeted by that monster.\nFrustrated, I called out to the princesses again.\n“Quickly! Right now, that monster is only focused on its offspring! It won’t try to harm you even if you move!”\nAs if coming to her senses at my urgent words, Princess Lobelia, who had become pale, straightened her expression and stood up.\n“I’ll call them!”\nPrincess Lobelia tore the skirt of her dress, which was not suitable for running, with her hands, and then ran to where the other nobles were.\nThe protection magic was still strong, but each attack by that monster was quickly draining my mana.\nI can’t stand it for long like this.\nThe moment I thought so.\n-hee hee hee-!\nA sudden neighing sound was heard, and someone appeared quickly.\n[TL: Join Patreon to support us and to read 3 chapters ahead of the release. ]",

      "content": "When I rode my horse as fast as I could and arrived at the destination where the mother monster was headed, it was the place where princesses were waiting.\nThe mother monster frantically thrust her head to attack a certain princess who was trembling in fear while hugging that baby monster in her arms. And Adilun was desperately using magic to protect that princess.\nThe good news was that it was still not too late. And as soon as I witnessed that scene, I immediately grabbed the throwing spear that was hanging from the horse’s saddle and threw it.\nWedge-!\nA bloody sound piercing the air was heard, and the spear flew and stuck into the body of the monster whose head was buried in the protection magic.\nBang!\nIts body bounced off from the impact of the spear, but the impact itself did not seem to be that great.\nThe spear, which must have been properly pierced into its torso, gradually began to protrude out of its body. It seemed to be a specie with quite a bit of self-regeneration ability.\nJust in case, to confirm my doubts I examined it with my mana eyes. And the reason why the spear fell from the monster's body was as excepted. The dark and turbid airflow of mana in its body was healing its body on its own.\nNot only that but mana and magic did not work on iteither, as if it was the special property of its leather and fur.\nAnd looking around, I saw signs of all sorts of magic, so it seemed that Adilunhad used offensive magic to defeat it, but it didn’t seem to work.\nIn other words, it was a monster that was no different from a natural and worst enemy to the magicians who could not use mana to strengthen their bodies.\nIt was a fairly high-ranking monster, but if there were knights, it wouldn’t have been able to rampage like this. It seemed that this happened while the knights were away because something else had happened.\n'If I hadn’t lost my way, I would have been in big trouble.'\nIt was only now that I understood that Adilun was only using protective magic and it was the best she could do. It was fortunate that she was able to distract the monster and protect everyone.\nIf it wasn’t for that, everyone here would be in danger.\nI calmly took a stance, strengthened my body with mana, and watched all of that monster's actions with my mana eyes.\nJudging from the speed at which itwas running earlier, it was clear that I would not be able to keep up with its speed with my current body, so I had to aim for the moment itrushed towards me.\nFortunately, it was clear that itwas looking at me as a top priority to eliminate, perhaps because I had attacked itearlier.\nIt will move to get rid of me and get its baby back. I had to kill it before that.\n“Physis! Internal attacks using mana or magic do not work on that monster!”\nI nodded my head as if to say not to worry, at Adirun’s urgent shout that I suddenly heard.\nAt that moment, I kicked the ground, and a golden remnant disturbed its eyes.\n\"Come at me!\"\nThe figure of the monster approaching me at a creepy speed was terrifying to watch, but I was ready.\nBut with my current level, It was obvious to me that I will not be able to keep up with its speed, and it was normal for me not to be able to see itproperly. If I had the level of my previous life, It would not have been the case. I would not miss any of itsmovements and maybe I will be able to defeat itin instant.\n'But now is not the time for thinking that. I should focus on dealing with itsfirst. Yes, this will do the work...'\nI saw itopening its mouth and rushing to crush me with its teeth.\nWhich muscles itwas moving, where its feet were going, all of that information was captured by my mana eyes, so no matter how fast it was going, I knew where itis or will be going.\n'Yes, this point will be the point where itand I collide.'\nI put the rotation from my feet and waist on my fist and struck at that point.\nBanng!\nWhat came out was the roar of metal colliding with each other.\nThat monster went out again. However, as I saw earlier, itsbody seemed to be incomprehensible.\nAs expected, the monsterrose up again and fired at me again with the intent to kill, but that attack never reached me. And whenever itsattack misses, my fist hits itshead.\nNo matter how hard the fabric was, if you keep hitting one point, it will break through.\nPerhaps itrealized that itcouldn’t just aim for biting, so ittried many things, such as using its claws, changing the direction of its attack, and tricking my movements.\nBut all of those things didn’t even hit me in any way, and I found an opening in the monster and attack itagain with more power.\nWow!\nJudging from the fact that the shape of its hand was gradually changing, it seemed that its skin had been damaged considerably.\nThe rapid speed and sharp movements it showed earlier gradually became dull and slow, and because of that, I was able to approach iteasily.\nAs I approached itlike that, the moment I was about to finish it, a stream of black light suddenly exploded from its body, and its golden hair began to turn black.\n* * *",

A stream of corrupted black mana looked as if it was burning that monster's own life.\nThe surrounding ground started shaking, and that monster’s body began to regenerate itself.\nNow it glared at me with even more murderous intent. Then, without making even a small sound, it ran toward me to attack.\nIt was difficult to keep up with its increased speed. In the blink of an eye, I saw it in front of me with its mouth wide open, aiming for my neck.\nI instinctively moved my body to the side and barely managed to dodge it.\nCertainly, that monster went berserk and incomparably stronger than before. Possibly strengthened by burning its own life, it attacked me with black mana surrounding it.\nEven in a rather dangerous situation, I looked at it more calmly. I trusted my eyes, I trusted the experience I had from my previous life, and I remembered the reason I was fighting for.\n\"Yes.\"\n'I’m sure I’ve fought enemies that can’t compare to this one. They were far more powerful and terrifying than this, so I can defeat it.'\nReflecting on my previous life reminds me of the heterogeneous monsters I have fought and won against. Some were bigger than modern tall buildings, and some were as small as humans, but the power inherent in them was beyond imagination.\nThey caused an earthquake with one step and a tsunami with one gesture.\nDidn’t I risk my life against such beings?\nNow how can I be afraid of monsters like that? I’ve been through too many things and dangerous monsters.\nSure, I’m not as strong as I was in my previous life. The difference was like the sky and earth. However, I still knew the experience of fighting them and how to use the human body to its limit. So I'm not going to give up this easily.\n'I can't embarrass my past self by giving up here, Right!'\nWith a little smile on my face, I opened my eyes and prepared myself to face that monster with everything I have.\nAnd like before, it made itself go a little faster, seeing how I was aiming at it. And because of that, I struggled not to miss its movements.\nFortunately, I was able to capture the figure of that monster. It was a blurry afterimage, but that was enough.\nThe eyes that saw through the essence gave me a lot of information even at that moment.\nOf course, it was not just that it was faster, I felt as if all of its physical abilities also had been strengthened.\nI won’t be able to hit it with a moderate punch like before.\nIf that’s the case, I’ll have to focus more on that.\nI stepped out, raised my mana, and focused on one point of my fist. Before long, I twisted my feet and waist, and put all my strength into my fists. I stretched out my fist and hit the point where the afterimage of the monster reached.\n-Bangggg!\nIt was not the sound of a normal punch or collision, what came out was a roar that shook the entire ground. And that monster's body instantly froze and our eyes met.\nThe frenzied murderous intent in its eyes was still intact, but its body was not. The dark and turbid mana coming out of its body faded, and the hair gradually began to return to its original color.\nThe ferocious spirit exploded at me spasmodically, but it was just a last resort before losing its life. I raised my fist again… … And hit on the head again.\n-Bangg!\nIn the ensuing blow, that monster's head exploded.\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\nPhysis didn’t show a bit of agitation even though that monster went berserk. He just watched the monster quietly glaring at him.\nNormally, when a monster burns all its life and goes berserk, it was normal for even skilled knights to be agitated, even for a moment.\nNot to mention, that monster is quite high in my opinion. Even I was pushed back.\nWhile facing such a monster, I couldn’t see the slightest bit of fear in its eyes.\nEven the fight he showed me just now was surprising, but looking at him standing like that while receiving such a frenzied murder intent and attacks, I wondered if he was the Physis I knew.\nIt didn’t take long to watch the suffocating confrontation. The moment the monster moved, my eyes couldn’t even see it properly.\nAt that moment, the monster was in front of Physis. With its mouth open, its black teeth thrust in, looking as if it would bite Physis’ neck at any moment.\nI tried to shout that it was dangerous, but before that, I heard a strong noise hitting the space in my ears.\nIt was just one punch. However, it was a powerful blow that was fundamentally different from when he faced monsters earlier. If it wasn’t for that, there’s no way that gigantic body that looked solid at first glance would lose its balance and sway at once.\nAnd the moment the monster lost its balance, he punched again…\nBangg!\nAt that moment, the monster’s head exploded.\n\"What the hell!!\".\nIs that Physis I knew, who was so weak just three months ago? As if it was nothing, he shook his hand once and came towards me.\n“Are you hurt?”\n“I’m fine. What about you?”\n“As you can see. My fists are a little sore, but that’s okay.”\nThere were many things I wanted to ask, but now it was not the time to talk about them.\nPromising myself to ask this question later, I nodded.\n“Fortunately, I was able to arrive at the right time. Even if it was a little late, something big would have happened.”\n“Thanks. It was really a dangerous situation…”\nThe surroundings overflowed with cheers and court ladies and princesses started expressing their gratitude to Physis.\nHowever, Physis was not flattered by such gratitude but just hovered around me.\n'Is he trying to make sure I don’t have any injuries?'\nIt’s a strange thing. Compared to him three months ago, isn’t he a very different person?\n“Princess Rodenov.”\nWhile I was immersed in such thoughts, I suddenly heard a voice calling my name. When I turned around, Princess Aristata was standing there.\n“What is it?”\nAt my question, she immediately bowed to me.\n“Sorry. And thank you. Thanks to you I'm alive....”\nShe looked at me with a straighter attitude and continued her words after a little pause.\n“I was stupid. I am terribly sorry for putting everyone at risk.”\nShe told all of her mistakes and bowed her head saying she was sorry for them. The princesses around her who praised Physis for being great were at a loss for words.\n“It worked out, so it’s okay.”\n“Still...”\nWhen I said it insignificantly, she tried to follow up, wondering if she had anything more to say.\n“It’s okay.”\nAfter I told her it was okay, I added a word.\n“But keep in mind one thing. Having compassion is not a bad thing in itself. But if something happens because of that sympathy, the princess has to take responsibility for that sympathy.”\n“…Yes. Thank you so much again. Princess Rodenov.”\nAnd after all of that, Physis said to me.\n“Adilun. Come to think of it, where is the baby monster? I guess we will have to deal with it.”\n“Ah. If it’s a baby monster, I’m sure…”\nI immediately recalled the place where I put the baby monster.\nNot far away, a baby monster was dying out and It was now impossible to recover him.\nWe have to kill it anyway, so it doesn’t matter.\n“Oh, It's here.”\nThe moment Physis said that and was about to approach the baby monster, Princess Aristata suddenly spoke to Physis.\n“If you don’t mind, can you leave it to me?”\nI didn’t understand.\nWhy would she, who just a while ago tried to save the baby monster, now come and kill it?\n“Princess Gloschna?”\nWhen I questioned her, she returned what I had just told her.\n“This happened because of me, so I felt like I had to take responsibility… …Will it be okay?”\n“…”\nI nodded without speaking.\n“Thank you.”\nAfter saying that, she approached the baby monster. Its breathing was barely audible now.\nWhat could be the reason for doing it that way? It's going to die anyway now.\nShe drew a dagger from her bosom. It seemed to be a self-defense dagger carried for an unknown purpose.\nBefore long, she plunged the dagger into the young monster’s neck.\nIt was a dagger stabbed with clumsiness, but the dagger, as if it was a sword of good quality, quickly lodged itself in the young monster’s neck.\n“… …sorry.”\nWhen the monster died, she pulled the dagger from the monster’s neck and wiped it with her handkerchief. Her hands were shaking with a trembling that she couldn’t hide.\nI don’t know what kind of determination she had to end the life of that monster herself.\nBut there was one thing I realized for sure.\nI could understand why Princess Lobelia had high regard for Princess Aristata. She was essentially a different person from the one who gloated simply because she was born into a high position.\nA person who was somewhat immature, but eventually acknowledges and accepts her immature appearance.\nA person who faces her mistakes squarely knows how to apologize for them, and knows how to take responsibility.\nShe was essentially a different person from humans who shied away from responsibility.\n* * *\nPrincess Lobelia arrived after the situation was settled. As soon as she arrived, she asked who killed the monster, and was surprised when she knew that it was Physis.\nShe thanked Physis for protecting the princesses, and Physis just nodded expressionlessly. It was a bit of a reprimand.\nPrincess Lobelia must have realized this as well, so she took care of the monster situation herself, apologized directly to all the nobles present, and said that she would no longer accept the opinion of releasing dangerous monsters during hunting competitions.\nFrom what I heard, it was a kind of custom to release monsters during the National Foundation Day hunting competition.\nEveryone was relieved because a situation like now hadn’t happened in the past, but now that this problem has erupted, they probably won’t be able to see monsters in the hunting grounds from now on.\nAll of that was over, and the winner of the hunting competition was finally decided.\n“… …So, the one who earned the highest score while subduing the dangerous monsters. Physis Ortaire. You are the winner of the National Foundation Day Hunting Competition.”\nWhat was contained in His Majesty’s low voice was… Physis.\nPhysis subdued even monsters with amazing skills and showed his saddle to the nobles as if to prove that he did not only subjugate monsters.\nThe nobles who saw the corpses of numerous, yet rare, animals in the saddle had no objection that he was the winner.\nIt was the same for me too. Because I never expected him to win.\nA lot of questions popped up in my head, but I knew one thing.\nPhysis has changed.\nI couldn’t help admitting that fact as I watched him kneeling down on one knee and smiling as he returned the handkerchief I had handed to him.\n[TL: Join Patreon to support us and to read 3 chapters ahead of the release. ]",

      "content": "My father looked around and seemed to understand at once.\nI’m sure my father would have seen countless eyes on me. Most of them were friendly, but as expected, there were also many people who were jealous of me, and there were also a few more ferocious gazes mixed in.\n“This is true. I never imagined that you, who was an arrogant idiot of Ortaire, would become the center of attention like this.”\n“So do I. Rather, I think it would have been nice to not have this much attention. It's just uncomfortable.”\n“Are you saying that? Anyway, I won’t interfere with your actions from now on, so take care of yourself. It would be nice to find Princess Rodenov and span time with her. And if you find her in any difficult situation, go and help.”\n“I was thinking of that anyway. Well then, I will go after a few minutes after their eyes on me go down a little.”\n“Yes.”\nHow long has it been? Since I was holding out among my family, their interest in me was gradually fading. I didn’t miss that chance and quickly looked for the place where Adilun was.\nAs a result of turning my gaze around, I saw Adilunsurrounded by the gaps of various princesses.\nShe, too, was getting a lot of attention. Maybe it’s because she used magic to stop the monsters and protect Princess Aristata.\nThinking that it would at least be better than being exposed to hostile and jealous glances, I approached her.\n“Adilun.”\n“Oh, Physis.”\nAs soon as I approached, she smiled at me and said,\nTo the extent that Adilun reacted like that, I could guess how much she suffered from the alternative princesses. There must have been questions about me and all sorts of questions about using magic.\n“Let’s go. The elders of the family are calling.”\n“I know.”\n“Ah…”\nI could hear the exclamations of the mourning princesses. In particular, considering that there were also princesses who looked at me and brightened their eyes, it seemed that the barrage of questions that were directed at Adilunwould also come at me, so I quickly avoided the seat.\nI pretended to go to the elders of the family with Adilun, and immediately got out of the banquet hall and headed for the garden outside. The banquet was still in full swing, so the garden was quiet, to the extent that there was not a single person.\n“Ah? Physis. Didn’t you say we had to go to see the family?”\n“To be precise, it was a lie.”\n“Yes?”\n“Originally, my father looked around the banquet hall and told me to help Adilun, if she was in trouble. But I can’t say that right away, can I?”\n“Aha. Thanks anyway. There were too many questions? It was really hard.”\n“You suffered in many ways.”\n“Suddenly, what kind of banquet is this? I just wanted to rest.”\n“I agree too. Now that this has happened, we left the banquet hall, so let’s rest here.”\n“Ah... ...Okay.”\nI sat down and rested for a while, but I kept silent to be considerate of Adilun. She looks tired anyway, so I don't want to upset her with any useless words of mine.\nThe view of the garden was very beautiful. Renowned gardeners of the royal family must have endured all kinds of hardships for today. So that the nobles will not be hurt.\nSo this quiet garden was the most suitable place to rest.\nHow long has it been like that?\nWhen the sun sets completely and night comes. When I look at the sky, which gradually turns red and then turns purple again, I feel a sense of fullness in my heart even though I haven’t seen anything great.\nIt was a scenery that I could never see in my previous life, but it was a sight that I had seen countless times in this world, so why was it that I feel strangely emotional?\nI wonder if it was because of the silence that lingers around me and Adilun.\nSilence itself draws attention to the surrounding landscape.\nAnyway, as I was staring at the sky like that, I suddenly heard the voice of Adilun.\n“Can we talk about something?”\n“Yes?”\n“Because it’s really quiet… … It’s awkward.”\n“I don’t have anything to say either.”\n“Others are talking about what they hunted today, but don't you have anything to say like them?”\n“I don’t really want to show off like that. Besides, everyone knows what I’ve caught, so I don’t think there’s any need to talk about it.”\n“For this… …You worked hard.”\n“Yes. And I received your handkerchief.”\nAt my words, she was furious.\n“Eww! Please don’t talk like that. Just keep your mouth shut on a topic you don’t even have the heart to talk about. You’re just making people’s hearts upset.”\nBut contrary to what she said, it wasn’t that she didn’t like it. Considering all the disgust and displeasure she had shown me before, it had improved considerably.\nThat alone was good, and it makes me smile. Seeing my smile, she sighed.\n“Why are you laughing so much?”\n“Just, thinking about a few months ago, your reaction seems to have changed.”\nAt my words, she began to ponder something.\n“All my reactions now have changed because you have changed.”\n“Yes?”\n“The day you knelt down, and I said that... ...There will never be a day when I will trust you.”\n“Surely it was.”\n“But now, that thought was about to shake a little. Although I said I will trust you but I didn’t even want to admit that you changed. Because I thought it wouldn’t last long anyway.”\n“… …Is that so?”\n“But for three months, you must have kept trying to be changed. If you didn’t make an effort, it would have been impossible to subdue the monsters alone.”\n“It is...”\nShe said while twirling her hair. She made a slightly embarrassed expression and finally said with a weak smile on her lips.\n“I won’t say I’m sorry. It’s true that I didn’t trust you. I don’t want to wrap the truth in plausible words. still… … Looking at what you’ve done, I can’t believe that you have changed.”\n“Okay.”\nChanged… … . That’s right. After realizing my previous life, I am surprisingly different from before. I nodded in agreement with her words.\n“Yes. You have changed. I can’t help but think that you are a completely different person. If you had shown me that way when we first met, our relationship wouldn’t have been this awkward.”\n“… …”\n“Anyway, thank you. If you hadn’t come to the rescue at that time, it would have been a big problem for the people present. oh, and don’t get me wrong, because I haven’t fully opened my heart to you.”\n“I never thought of that. I didn’t think that just doing that much would cover up the mistakes of the past.”\n“Hahahaha. I’m glad. A year of insults you did to me… …The mental pain I suffered is too great to do all of that now, so please try a little harder in the future.”\nWhen she laughed bitterly, she rather burst into laughter and said, It was the first laugh of her I ever heard.\n“So nine months from now. For nine months, if you respect me and maintain the same attitude as you do now, I will think about you.”\n“Nine months… Think about me?”\n“Yes. 9 months. If you do that, it will be just one year. If you repay me with a year of hard work for a year of insult you did to me… …From then on, we are going back to square one. In an equal relationship, with no sense of debt to each other.”\n“Would it be all right if you forgive me for my past mistakes?”\n“Yes. As I told you before, I want to move forward with my companion, relying on each other. therefore… … I hope I can trust you this time.”\n“Certainly. It will be as you wish, Adilun.”\n“I’ll wait. So please try a little harder.”\nWatching her speak with a small smile, I had no choice but to make a promise again.\nI will never make a mistake this time.\n[TL: Join Patreon to support us and to read 3 chapters ahead of the release. ]",

      "content": "A cheer that was stronger than before covered the arena.\n* * *\n“Nice. Isn’t it, Chancellor?”\nThe emperor smiled contentedly. Following his laughter, Prime Minister, Crocus Glossuna also smiled and said.\n“Isn't the tourney always nice, Your Majesty?”\n“Right. A clash of pure human flesh without the use of mana. What could be more beautiful than this? More than that. Did that refereesay the winner's name was Ulrich?”\n“That’s right.”\n“Could other knights really show the same side as him?”\nIt seemed that the emperor was even more eager for the match now and dragged his body forward to the throne.\n“It must be. Many sons of nobles who made their name in jousting participated this time, so it must be more fierce than ever.”\n“Right. It was also nice to leave it to you. Oh, come to think of it, is there another person you are paying attention to?”\n“Yes.”\n“Oh my. Who is a knight that the chancellor, who is uncompromising, is paying attention to? Who is he?”\n“Alan Aiden... It's Sir Alan Aiden.”\n“Aiden? Wait, if it’s Aiden…”\n“Yes. He was the one who will battle against Rodenov.”\n“Oh my. Hahaha. That’s really funny. There will be no time to be bored this National Foundation Day. By the way, what about his jousting skills?”\n“He doesn’t usually behave very well, and he can’t handle mana, but he is excellent at hunting and jousting. The name Aiden is not in vain.”\n“It’s Aiden… … . Hahahaha. Nowadays, he is just a slob who manages merchants, but in the past, his name was also brilliant, so it’s natural. I miss that time.”\n“That’s right.”\nAt those words, the emperor said with a look of longing for some reason.\n“Right. Oh, It's starting. The preparations are pretty quick this time. Now, let's stop chatting and focus on the match.”\n“Yes. Your Majesty.”\nCrocus, after saying that, just bowed his head and nodded.\n‘As expected, he didn't even give me a chance to be vigilant.’\nBut, like a clever man, he had just seen through the emperor’s words.\nA mere rich man, a man who was once brilliant. Aiden.\nIn an aristocratic society, Aiden became extremely wealthy through merchants before the land war with Rodenov was scheduled. Aiden, a family of knights who once valued chivalry, abandoned chivalry and pursued wealth.\nNo one was cursing it. For a few years, it was natural for nobles to pursue wealth, and nobles who were not wealthy were not even treated as nobles.\nBut the emperor and Crocus both knew. Even though he has become wealthy, that was only the beginning of his downfall.\nIt was wealth that sustains the lives of nobles. However, it was thanks to their reputation that let them be nobles before that wealth.\nBut with time nobles lose honor. Only ten years ago, in such cases, the aristocratic family would never again integrate into aristocratic society.\nBut over the course of ten years, the nobles have changed. Nobles who pursued honor were buried in wealth, and honor was only incidental.\nCrocus Glossuna made it that way. With the support of the emperor on his back, he thoroughly corrupted the nobles and even the emperor.\n'Why did the emperor give this opportunity to myself who is a thorn in the eye?' After searching for the answer for ten years, Crocus still couldn’t find it.\nIt’s a strange thing. There must have been some reason when the emperor made himself chancellor, but he couldn’t even figure out what the reasonwas, so it was frustrating for Crocus. Because there must be a cause and effect in everything.\nThe reason why the emperor dared to listen to Aiden’s story and smiled as if seeing something he missed was probably because he overlapped himself with them. At one time, he was famous as a sage, but it was a thing of the past now, the emperor now was a tyrant.\n'Why the hell did he do these things with such eyes?'\nIt is unknown. However, Crocus thought that no matter what purpose the emperor had since he had given himself this opportunity, he would only use it to the fullest.\n‘I don’t know what His Majesty was aiming for to make me sit as chancellor… …But I also do not intend to be easily defeated.’\n* * *\n“Nice.”\nAt my low exclamation of today's events, Adilun also nodded in agreement.\n“Yes.”\n“Come to think of it, is this your first time seeing a jousting match, Adilun?”\n“Yes. In the North, there was no time for these luxuries like tournaments.”\n“No wonder. You surprised by the roar you heard when the two knights collided earlier.”\nAs I smiled, she glared at me fiercely. Of course, the shame contained in it was conveyed desperately.\n“Ahhhh. Are you going to keep teasing me?”\n“Hahahaha. It’s a joke.”\n“Well, it’s true that I was surprised… …Anyway, it’s definitely a great sense of place. The moment the two knights collided with each other, I was shocked. I must say that the power is enormous. Even though it obviously doesn’t have mana.”\n“Rather, it may be so. Since it is a match that is only fought with pure human bodies, it is inevitable that those who see it for the first time will be surprised by such power.”\n“Now I am looking forward to it more. The upcoming games will be fun, right? Oh, but Physis, Why did you participate in jousting?”\n“Actually, I don’t know either. I don’t know why, but my name is on it. I’ve never applied for it…”\n“Yes? Isn’t that a big deal?”\n“That’s right. It’s not like the organizers misjudged something.”\n“That was my work.”\nSuddenly, I heard my brother’s voice behind me. He said he was away for a while, why did he suddenly come back?\n“Brother?”\n“You won the hunting competition, so I think you can win the jousting too. I heard that you even killed a monster single-handedly, so it should not be ridiculous to have a jousting match?”\n“Aren’t you expecting too much from me? I’m not good at jousting. Would you rather go out?”\n“Why me? You have to go for this.”\n“Yes?”\n“Since the value of the family’s name has been lowered in all sorts of ways by you in the past, wouldn’t it be right to raise it again like this?”\n“But wouldn’t I be just a laughing stock if I went to a tournament and lost, that I’m not even good at? Wouldn’t it be better for my older brother to go out to raise the value of the family’s name?\n“I’m not good at jousting.”\n“No, Is it good for a nobleman like you to make his younger brother go?”\nWhen I asked as if I was dumbfounded, my older brother said surprisingly seriously.\n“I have no reason to go, but you have a reason to go.”\n“Why?”\n“I don’t have a fiance, but you do.”\n“Ah.”\n“If you win the tournament, not only you, but Princess Rodenov’s prestige will rise as well. Usually, the prestige of princesses is judged by how good their fiancées are.”\n“Oh if that's the case...”\n“I’m fine…”\nSomehow, when Adilun spoke as if she was burdened by my older brother’s words, I shook my head.\n“My brother has a point. I will go.”\n“Wouldn’t that be dangerous?”\n“Didn’t you see how he beats even monsters? He can do it.”\nAdilun still looked at me with worried eyes. but it was true that catching monsters and jousting are fundamentally different.\n“Oh, and one more thing.”\n“What else?”\n“He’s on the list. A guy who belongs to a family involved in a great duel with Rodenov. That bastard, who spoke carelessly about Princess Rodenov. Alan Aiden.”\n“Aha.”\nCome to think of it, did he lure the baby monster and endanger Adilun? Since there was no physical evidence, I was thinking of repaying it at the great duel, but it turned out rather well.\n“I can’t help it now that I have heard that. I will do my best.”\nTo me who laughed ferociously, Adilun still looked worried, and my older brother gave a wicked smile as if he was plotting something.\n“Good good. By the way, I made a bet on you.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Private Gambling.”\nSomehow, he appeared out of nowhere and said about my participation. He was away for a while... Did he go for the gambling and plan all of this?\n“Yes? how much?”\n“All my personal expenses.”\n“No, this crazy man?”\n“What are you so surprised about? It’s obvious that you will win anyway. I bet that you will be the winner.”\n“Why did you do that, What are you looking in me, that gives you so much confidence?”\n“Your talent.”\nTo my question, my brother gave a simple answer. Talent.\nAgain, that wasn’t a mistake. Obviously, my body had the eyes to copy what I saw once, and the ability to fully execute it.\n“Then I must live up to your expectations.”\n“Yes. Good luck. It will be your turn soon.”\n“Alright.”\n[TL: Join Patreon to support us and to read 3 chapters ahead of the release. ]",

      "content": "'I wonder if I have to watch another match or two.'\nThinking about when my turn was going to come I saw another match end. A short waiting time was given to everyone, and in the meantime, a servant from afar approached me and said to me.\n\"Prince Physis Ortair. Your match will start soon. So now you need to go to the tournament waiting room.\"\n“Oh okay. I'm going.”\nI finally got to the point where I had to go to the waiting room for my match.\n“Adilun. I guess I have to go and get ready.”\nAdilun stared at me at my words and nodded.\n“Yes. Be careful. And this…”\nThen she took something out of her arms and gave it to me.\nIt was a new handkerchief, not much different from the one she had given me last time. However, the pattern engraved on the handkerchief was slightly different.\nThe elaborately carved dragon was now holding a sword.\nThe dragon was the symbol of Rodenov, and the sword was the symbol of Ortaire, so the dragon with the sword in it must mean an alliance between the two places and harmony between them.\nWhen the hell did she prepare a handkerchief like this?\nWhile thinking this, I suddenly remembered that Adilun had stayed in the inn yesterday to take a break, and at that very moment, I realized why she hadn’t come out of the inn all day.\nBut why did she even do this?\nAdilun told me to do my best for us. Perhaps this handkerchief was an extension of that request.\nAnd if that's the case, then I have to do my very best. Not simply for the name of the family or for the prestige of her and me.\nBut for our promise.\n“I will do my best this time too.”\n“I don’t want you to win, and it's not important if you win or not. So just don’t get hurt. It will be quite dangerous as you can not use mana.”\nJust like the last time, she told me curtly that I shouldn't get hurt.\nSomehow it seemed to be the opposite of handing me a handkerchief, but I knew that it was her own concern and worry for me, so I answered her with a smile.\n“Do not worry. Then, I will go now.”\n“Yes.”\n* * *\nIn the private waiting room of the tournament, the servants were dressing me in the armor my older brother had sent.\nThe wearing of the armor ended with a dull metal sound.\nNormally the armors are heavy, but the armor made with the technology of the Ortaire estate, where metallurgy and blacksmithing skills were very developed, was much lighter than any other armor.\nIn addition, even without mana, my body did not feel any burden even though I was wearing very heavy-looking armor, probably because I had been training endlessly.\n“Sir Physis Ortaire. The preparations are over.”\nThe title of sir can be called only after being formally knighted, but since knighthood was temporarily granted to all those who participated in the tournament, my current official title was now Sir Physis Ortaire.\n“Yes.”\n“Can you mount a horse? Let me know if you need any help.”\n“Okay. I can do it...”\nTo the servant’s question, I simply replied that I was fine and mounted the horse.\nThe horse seemedto have been well-reared as it was not weak. On the contrary, it can be said that it was a very excellent one.\nAlthough It was natural because the horses here were directly managed by the imperial family, even so, it seemed because the imperial family considered the National Foundation Day tournament as an important event, such excellent horses were given out for the tournament.\n“Let’s go.”\nI gently stroked the horse’s mane and said to the servant.\n“I understand, Sir.”\nAfter leaving the private waiting room, a long passage leading to the arena unfolded. In the aisle, I saw a knight who looked like my opponent.\nThat knight rode his horse, gave me a glance, and passed.\nHowever, I was able to look into his eyes which laughed at me in those glances. Well, it’s natural since I’ve never had a history of raising my name through jousting.\nHis face was covered by a mask, So I could not tell who he was, but it didn’t really matter to me. After all, at the tournament, that person will experience the humiliation of being completely broken by the opponent he despises.\nIn that brief moment, I matched my body movements with those of the horse.\nOriginally, it would require countless training, but I didn’t really need it. Because I have already figured out with my mana eyes how this horse moves.\nAfter seeing this horse I also understood that this was definitely a war horse. It must be a horse that has gone through countless training sessions to defeat its opponents.\nIf I advance as the horse advances, the enemy’s torso will be at the end.\nIt will know much better than a newbie like me who is new to fighting on horseback.\nTherefore, it would not be difficult to defeat the enemy by assimilating me into the horse’s gaze, the horse’s breath, and the horse’s movement.\nOf course, to me who was accustomed to fighting alone, doing something on horseback was quite unfamiliar. but… …It wasn’t too bad though.\nSuddenly, my vision was clear. At the end of the long passage, the appearance of the vast tournament arena finally came into view.\n\"Yaaaaa!!\"\n\"Woahhh!!!\"\nThe voices of the tens of thousands of spectators shouting at the advance of the knights were truly overwhelming. I had not enough words to say anything about it.\nThe excitement they showed, made my heart race.\nAnd finally, my opponent and I met each other’s eyes, and at that moment, each of the servants came forward and spit out stories about their own knights.\n“...Therefore! Who is the winner of the recent hunting competition! Who is the reverse warrior who killed a ferocious monster with shiny golden hair with only two fists!”\n“Physis! Physis!”\nIn fact, rumors that I had beaten a monster to death in a hunting competition quickly spread to the streets of the festival. So that's why there were many people who shouted my name too. But I was embarrassed on listening to their shouts. It was the first time for me to be in this kind of situation.\nAnyway, as if the other side did not want to lose, he introduced the opponent with brilliant rhetoric. And finally, all the procedures were over.\nIn front of my eyes was the knight I had just encountered, holding a huge lance.\nI also lifted the lance given to me.\nA rugged wooden lance was given to all knights without much decoration by the imperial family. However, the atmosphere of the tournament overflowing with excitement had the power to make this lance look like a weapon from a myth.\nRaising our lances, we pointed them to each other.\nOf course, being in it would not be a pure courtesy.\nLike me, that person must be wrapped up in many thoughts.\nBut even so, there was one thing in common between me and that person, and that was...\nA warrior’s will to crush the enemy.\n-Boooo\nFlags were raised and horns resounded- and my horse shot forward.\n* * *\nThe scenery passes by and all kinds of sounds come together to sting my ears. The sound of a horse running on the ground, the sound of a horse breathing heavily, and cheers echoing throughout the arena resounded.\nHowever, I turned my attention away from all of that and rushed furiously at the opponent's side, but I saw him holding a lance and aiming at me.\nHow is he going to attack with that lance? Will he treat me as a beginner and simply attack quickly and hard, or will he wait for my lance to move and press it down?\n'No, it doesn't matter. I don't have to judge that.'\nNow that my eyes were looking at him, everything about him was being thoroughly penetrated by my eyes.\nThe place he was aiming for was the center of my chest.\nThat guy was looking down on me. Otherwise, there would be no way he would have made such a simple and direct attack.\nEven if he was confident in his strength, in the end, it is the difference in technique that decides the outcome.\nHe attacked directly with the unfounded conviction that his speed is faster than mine.\nIt’s funny. Even if the opponent didn’t make a name for himself in the tournament, you must never be arrogant.\nAn arrogant knight deserves to be humiliated.\nThe moment he aimed his lance for the center of my chest, I pressed his lance with mine, disrupting the target, and then stabbed it in the center of his chest.\n-Quaang!\nIn an instant, his lance lost its power and went past me in vain, but my lance hit the center of the opponent’s chest and made a loud noise.\nAt the same time, he fell off his horse.\nIt was a knockout; The game was decided at once.",

      "content": "“Hahaha. Actually, I was a bit worried. I thought that if he made a mistake, while we were trying to form an alliance, because of him a war would break out in reverse… …But it's fortunate that nothing like this happened.”\n“Hahahaha. In fact, I was worried too.”\n“Anyway, I also apologize for the behavior he showed to you.”\n“I will not take it. That apology was already given to me by Physis.”\n“Aha. Even though it's rare, at least, he does some things well.”\n“I haven’t completely forgiven him yet… …But if he continues to be like this and respect me, later I will have no choice but to believe in him completely.”\n“I sincerely hope that day will come very soon.”\n“Okay then, let’s take a look at how far Physis goes up.”\n“Well, even if we don’t see it, it’s obvious that he will win… …Still, it will be fun to see the process.”\n“But why did you bet all your money on Physis even though you were not sure about his jousting skill?”\n“As I said before, it is purely because of his talent. I know his jousting skills will improve with each match. And all of the above I don’t bet unless I’m fully sure about something. But when I'm sure I can bet anything I can.”\n“Hehehe.”\n“Now that it’s like this, would you like to make a bet? It will make the tournament more exciting.”\nHearing my laughter, Prince Huiansubtly invited me to place a bet.\n“I will decline. And I have already made a bet.”\n“Yes? What do you mean?”\n“Handkerchief. Just like the hunting contest, but the handkerchief in the jousting game has a bigger meaning. Maybe if he wins… …The facial expressions of the other princesses will be quite nice to see.”\n“This is it, the princess is quite evil too.”\n“I am not that naive. You have to give back what you received. Maybe I’ll take away what they want so much.”\n“Hahahaha. It will be good to see how Physis will do later.”\nHuh? What is he talking about all of a sudden?\n“What do you mean?”\n“It’s nothing.”\nAt my question, Prince Huian merely smiled wickedly as usual.\nIt was like the mischievous smile I see when he plays tricks on his troublesome brother.\n* * *\nThe stadium where the hot sunlight was shining gradually became darker, and the brilliant sunlight turned into the soft yellowish glow of the sunset.\nToday’s match ended with the last knight finally being knocked off his horse. So, all the knights who participated in the tournament today gathered in the arena and left after listening to the praises of His Majesty, the Emperor.\nAmong them, the brightest one was Physis, who finished all of today’s matches with victories.\nAs Prince Huian said, Physis continued to grow more and more as he went through matches. Even knights with a fairly high reputation in tournaments couldn’t win against him.\nNo matter what their thoughts were, when they fired their lances, Physis grasped them all and either blocked them, diverted them, or conversely knocked his opponents off their horses.\nEven if one hit the chest, it was rare to see an opponent fall from a horse, and because of that, most knights aimed at the opponent’s head rather than knocking the opponent off the horse in one blow.\nRather, one has to aim for the head to get a higher score.\nBut Physis was different.\nHe dutifully aimed at the opponent’s chest in every match and knocked the opponent off the horse, and as a result, his name continued to soar.\nPhysis, who had become the biggest center of attention of this tourney, just spoke to me in a friendly way, as if he had no interest in any of his today's achievements.\n“Adilun, are you planning to rest in your room today?”\n“Well… ….I don't know?”\n“Then would you like to go watch the festival with me?”\n“A festival?”\n“Yes.”\nAccording to Physis, the other festivities begin as soon as the first day of the tournament ends.\nIt was said that the people who are excited through the jousting match and the merchants who want to do business with them, become one heart and create a scene of a lively festival.\n“Because there is nothing to do, and since you did so well in a tournament, we might as well celebrate it.”\n“Alright. Then, shall we go?”\n“Yes. Let’s go.”\nWe got out of the stadiumright away. And I immediately took out the mask that covered my entire face from my bosom.\nIt was a mask prepared in case I have to go out. It was obvious that other people would look at my scaly skin like a monster so It was a way of avoiding getting embroiled in unnecessary situations.\n“That’s… … Isn’t that a mask?”\nAs soon as I took out the mask, Physis looked at me with a depressed expression, perhaps feeling guilty.\nBut I was rather happy with his expression. Because It was clear to me that he cared about me.\n“Yeah. I think there will be a lot of people who look at me curiously when I go out on the streets as I am. I had it in case I would run into a lot of spectators. Fortunately, the tournament hall is divided into areas for nobles and citizens, so there was no need to use it.”\n“Ah…”\n“Don’t make that face. Because you didn’t do anything wrong this time. I honestly didn’t expect you to make such a face. Rather I'm happy.”\n“… …why?”\n“If you ask me to go to the festival without hesitation, then at least my appearance won’t offend you. Hahaha...”\n“Ah... That still...”\n“Hey. We don’t have to worry about anyone else anyway, so let’s go. It’s a festival. A lot of good things happened today, so let’s go out on the streets.”\nI immediately took Physis’ hand and led him out into the street.\nNow, even though the sun has clearly fallen, the streets are bright enough to remind one of daylight due to countless lanterns.\nWe walked aimlessly. There was no particular purpose of where to look, we just mixed among the people looking around the festival.\nIt felt quite new. It was different from the scenery of Rodenov, where cold winds always blow. It was warm, boisterous, and overflowing with happiness.\nAs if to blow away painful memories from the past, people always had a smile on their lips.\nIn the meantime, Physis and I were able to explore all sorts of interesting sights- Whether it was the technique of a traveling theater company or a play featuring a great hero. Also, there were many games of all kinds.\nAll those sights were unfamiliar but enjoyable. It’s much better than having a fight with princesses for no reason.\nAs if my joy had passed on to him, he let go of the gloomy expression he had made earlier and smiled with me.\n“It’s fun.” I said.\n“Is that so? That’s good.”\n“Are you having fun?”\n“Yes. I am happy too. It seems to convey the vitality of the lively people, so it’s fun just to look at them.”\n“Me too. It’s a very different landscape from Rodenov. Rodenov’s festival is not so lively. Because it is always cold.”\n“The same goes for Ortaire. Because it is adjacent to the border, the festival cannot be held carelessly.”\n“Ahahahaha. Even though we didn’t seem to have anything in common, there were some minor things in common. Like not knowing the festival.”\n“I mean...”\n“Well then, how should, we who don’t know festivals, enjoy the festivals?”\n“If there’s a place that looks interesting, we should stick our head in.”\n“Right.”\nAnswering my mischievous question just as playfully, he pulled me in reverse, and I was led meekly by his hand.\nI couldn’t believe this moment because I never dreamed that we would end up like this after we had many fights and despised each other.\nIt seemed that the promise he would change for me was not a lie. Suddenly, a promise came to mind. The promise I made with him last time.\nThe promise that, if he cared about me for the next nine months, he and I would go back to square one.\nIf this trend continues, maybe he and I can return to the starting point faster than nine months.\nWith that thought in mind, I had a small wish.\nA wish, that he doesn’t have to be capricious again and go back to the way he used to be.\n[TL: Join Patreon to support us and to read 3 chapters ahead of the release. ]",

      "content": "28 – Tourney (4)\n[Physis's POV]\nThe dark night enveloped all the areas and the lights on the streets also started turning off. Finally, it was time for the end of a fun-filled celebration.\nOf course, the celebration will continue throughout National Foundation Day, but it was not possible for us to come out like this every day, so I was a little disappointed.\nWhile I was thinking about all of today's events, Suddenly Adilun looked at me and said.\n“Today’s festival is over.”\n“Yes.”\n“Honestly, it was fun. It wasn’t bad to walk around wearing a mask.”\n“I’m glad.”\n“There was a lot of delicious street food, and there were plenty of things to see and do. Certainly, I can understand why people were looking forward to National Foundation Day. I really enjoyed it.\"\nAfter the lights of the festival were turnedoff, I could see a slight disappointment in Adilun's eyes, unmasked, and looked up at the sky.\nThat was proof of how much she seemed to have enjoyed today's festival. Perhaps, it was her most enjoyable experience of coming to National Foundation Day.\nSeeing her like this, I was also happy and glad. So I replied to her with a big smile.\n“Yes. I also enjoyed it.”\n“That’s fortunate. Then it’s time to return to the palace. And you also have to prepare for tomorrow's tournament.”\n“That's right... Yes, let’s go.”\nWe walked through festive streets with lights turned off in silence. Even though everything was silent, fragments of the festival still lingered lightly in the mind. It was a pity that it ended too soon.\nIt seemed that I, too, enjoyed the festival as much as Adilun.\nHow long had it been since I felt this feeling?\nThe hustle and bustle disappeared, silence lingeredaround, and all sorts of thoughts rushed through my head.\nWill I be able to avoid disappointing Adilun in the future?\nWill I be able to protect her from the many threats that lie ahead of her?\nWill I be able to protect the kindness she showed?\nSince I can’t always live with a strong will, I started to worry about whether I could always protect her or not.\nPerhaps because the surroundings were dark, I started having these thoughts.\nDarkness sometimes brings coziness but sometimes makes people tremble with anxiety.\nEspecially thinking about the future always make me anxious.\nI knew what kind of threat loomed in this world- In the near future, the plague will spread.\nThere will be war in the East.\nThe war will not end easily.\nIn the north, monsters will eat the negative emotions of humans and become stronger and will try to come down to the south, and in the center, Crocus Glossu aka Prime Minister will start a civil war.\nPrincess Lobelia and Adilun will fight against it.\nOf course, all of that situation could change due to the intervention of my existence or actions.\nNo, it will probably change for sure.\nSo I'm afraid. I was afraid that I'd make her even more unhappy. Because I don't know what changes will come in the future because of me.\nBut does that mean, I should not do anything and be terribly afraid?\nNo. I have to harden my heart. I have to believe that I can overcome any ordeal.\nJust like I did in my previous life.\n“...Hey, Physis.”\nAs I was lost in my thoughts for a long time, I heard Adilun’s low voice next to me.\n“Ah. Yes, Adilun.”\n“We have arrived at our destination.”\n“We have already arrived? Oh, I’m sorry. I was just thinking about something.”\n“Are you worried about something?”\n“A little… …There is something.”\n“Can you tell me what your worries are? I don't I can help or not, but I will try my best to help you.”\n“I was a little worried about whether I could do well in the future. Because I always had bad accidents.”\n“Ahh!”\nShe seemed to be struggling with something and said to me.\n“There is nothing I can say about that. I have always lived with similar concerns.”\n“…Is that so?”\n“Yes. Isn’t it a concern that everyone lives with? How will I live in the future? Will I be able to live happily or well? …Such troublesome thoughts and everything, is the same for me too... So, your concern is probably not the one that I can provide an answer to.”\n“Hahaha. If I think about it, yes, you are right.”\nShe was right. The problems I had were the ones I have to deal with on my own.\nI don't have to depend on anyone. I have to think about it until my head hurts and find a way, and someday the answer to my worries will come to me.\n“Still… …I can tell you one thing. I can’t read your mind, but at least the appearance of you that I’ve recentlyseen has been pretty good.”\nAt that moment, the one fear in my head disappeared.\nThe fear that I might do something bad to her again.\nIf she judged me okay recently, at least I wasn’t doing anything wrong.\n“Thank you. Thanks for helping.”\n“Yes?”\nAt my thanks, she put on a rather puzzled expression.\n“Now, go in. Aren’t you busy tomorrow too?”\n“I see. Oh, and Physis...”\n“Yes?”\n“Be careful in tomorrow’s tournament.”\n“It’s okay. You don’t need to worry.”\n“As I said before, I'm-”\n“-You said it because I have to go to a great duel, nothing else... I am well aware of it.”\n“Okay. Anyway, get some rest. You had a hard day today.”\nEven though she put on a slightly dissatisfied expression because she was deprived of her words, she did not forget to tell me to be careful.\n* * *\n[Omniscient pov]\nAlan Aiden raised his lanceand looked at his opponent before him.\nPhysis, a knight in black armor.\nNot long ago, he was the one who made all the things he was aiming for in vain.\nAlan's expression crumpled.\nOf course, he didn’t like all the compliments about Physis that came out of the servant’s mouth, and his stomach was twisted when he saw the princesses he usually courted with reddish faces looking at Physis.\nFurthermore, Physis was the person who provided the decisive reason for the battle between Rodenov and Aiden, so Alan had no choice but to hate Physis from bottom of his heart.\nBut In reality, it was Alan’s own careless mouth that provided the excuse for the Battle of the Territory.\nIgnoring all of that, Alan stared at Physis with overflowing hatred and murderous intent, but Physis just stared at him with nonchalant eyes without any change in expression.\nHowever, even those nonchalant eyes felt as if they were ignoring him, so Alan burned with even more rage and gripped the lance in his hand.\nHis goal was to shove this lance into Physis’ unlucky smooth face, flattening that proud nose.\nKnocking Physis off the horse? Alan had no intention of aiming for such trivial things.\nWhat motivated him to participate in this tournament in the first place? Wasn’t it to woo the princess he liked?\nHowever, he was greatly disgraced at the ball, and his family was in great danger, so he was ignored by other nobles. The only thing he wanted to do was to bring down the person, who made him like this, to the same level as himself.\n‘Today, I’ll definitely put this lance at your proud nose.’\nThinking so, Alan lowered the helmet to protect his face and sprinted towards Physis.\n* * *\n[Physis's POV]\nAlan Aiden; It was not hard to see that the guy was full of hatred toward me.\n'A guy who knew nothing but still treated others with contempt,' that was the only evaluation I would give him. Even if a guy like that came running to destroy me with hatred, it just seemed ridiculous to me.\nThe National Day ball, the hunting competition, and even this tourney, in many ways, I thought it was fate that I had no choice but to collide with him.\nBut today, it was rather good.\nPreviously, he had plotted a rather dangerous trick in the hunting competition, but I couldn’t prove it, so I thought to pay it back before the Great duel somehow. But an opportunity to pay it back came sooner than I expected.\nHowever, I had no intention of being careless. Judging from the way he fought in the tourney, he must have been pretty good at Jousting.\nThere was a risk of getting caught on his side if I was careless.\nI can’t lose to a man like him.\n“Let’s go.”\nI said softly to the horse. The horse stared at the front with a rough grunt, as if it understood the meaning of my words. Finally, the flag was raised, and he and I started galloping at each other at the same time.\nThe moment he and I finally face each other, the surroundings slow down as if time has stopped, and my eyes catch everything about him.\nWhere and how to move? Where to stab the lance? All of those paths began to become clear to my eyes.\nThe guy was aiming for my face. Rather than thinking of winning, would he rather smash my face?\nYes. Then I will aim at your face too.\nAs soon as my horse and his horse crossed, He tried to thrust his lance into my face.\n'Absolutely neat technique.'\nHe handled the lance in the cleanest way than all the knights I had met before this match. So much so that it was understandable to remain in the final round of the tournament.\nEven though his talent for mana was low, it seemed that he had at least one talent to show off.\nBut no matter how good he is… … If the blow containing so much skill is seen through by my eyes, it will be nothing but a fuss in the end.\n-Whoo!\nI turned my face and avoided his lance. -Swish!\nThe heavy sound of the wind could be heard from the lance that passed by the side of the helmet, near the ear.\nOn the other hand…\n-Bang!\nThere was the sound of something breaking; my lance lodged in his teeth shattered.\nThe guy was half-lying on the horse, perhaps because he had been struck in the face or because he was momentarily unconscious.\nSoon, his squire came to wake him, and then they prepared for the match again. Rather, the crowd began to cheer at the hot game aiming for each other’s faces.\n'2 points for this.'\nSince he didn’t fall off the horse fall, the match hadn't been announced yet.\n'That means I can still hit him in the face one more time.'\nI glared at him with a somewhat evil smile.",

      "content": "29 – Tourney (5)\nAlan, who barely came to his senses, covered his face again with a helmet before looking at Physis.\n‘What? This guy!!’\nAlan was not able to properly see or predict Physis’s attacks. And it was a very big problem for him because in the tournament if one didn’t predictor avoid the other's attack, they will have no choice but to lose.\n‘It’s too fast.’\nHe expected that his lance would hit Physis's face, but the lance that stuck in the face was not his own, but of Physis.\n‘Damn it. Why he is that good! What should I do now?’\nAlan instinctively realizedthat Physis's attacks were beyond his reach.\nHowever, he had lost many things due to Physis, which he could not give up on.\nThe status of his family, his honor, and his future, all of that was thrown into the gutter because of Physis. So for him, it was already too late to regret or give up.\nOn the other hand, Alan didn’t even think that all of this was his fault in the first place.\n'I was just telling the truth, but isn’t this too much for just telling the truth?'\n'She really looked like a monster. Damn you Physis! This is all because of you...'\nAlan gritted his teeth and glared at Physis.\nIn his mind, the reason behind his miserable situation and danger to his familywas none other than Physis.\n'It’s not over yet. '\nAs Alan muttered, he held the lance, the servant had brought, in his hand.\n‘This time, I will definitely hit his face with my lance.’\n'Even if I use my all strength, I wouldn’t be able to bring him down to the same level as myself, but at least I’d give him some shame.'\n* * *\n[Physis's POV]\nAlan didn't lose his fighting spirit even after being beaten so badly in the face. Well, since he got into lots of trouble because of that day, he must hate me. So it was natural.\nThe psychology of such people is obvious. They do not accept their faults and always try to find fault in others.\nThe reason I knew this so well was simple. Because I was like that too.\nIn my past life, I lived like that and changed when I met the child who gave me that novel, and in my present life, I changed because of the influence of my past life.\nBecause I was also that kind of person for myself. The way I see Alan Aiden now was the same as my past self. I mean, it was no different from facing the past me; Selfish, hoping for miracles, and dealing with life's problems…\n...A person who does not admit his faults and tries to find the reason for his mistakes in others.\nIt was the pitiable self of the past, and the traces of the 20 years that still remained in me, that I still haven’t gotten rid of.\nI still don't know when those traces would crawl out at any time.\nSo I have to break them. Thoroughly trample on them so that they can never crawl out of me again.\nFor the time being, that should be enough.\nI repeated the same procedure as before while facing him, I matched my breath with my horse's movements.\nNext, I raised my lance and kept an eye on him.\nThe vibration of the horse running on the ground spread throughout the body, and the rough cry of the galloping horse echoed through the tournament arena.\nI lift a heavy lance this time again, and the purpose was the same as before. To avoid his lance and to hit my lance on his face.\nWith the rapid movements of the horses, the distance between him and me was gradually narrowing.\nI feel a spear attack that was faster than before, threatening and aiming at my face.\nBetween the gap of the mask, I could clearly see his eyes full of hatred fixed on me.\nBut I will not allow him to harm my body or the person I hold dear.\n'Do you know you are not the only one who has hatred'\n'I too have it. I hate you for showing me fragments of my past.'\nI pointed my lance towards his face and inserted my lance at a faster speed than him.\n-Bang!!\nWith a louder sound than before, the lance of the guy who was only focusing on my face, shattered and scattered.\nHowever, my blow didn’t end there, I pierced between the scattered lances and hit the guy’s face again.\n-Kwajik!\nMy lance, which had cracks because of crushing his lance, was completely destroyed when it met its final destination, his face.\nAnd then finally, the winner was announced.\n“Winner is! Physis Ortaire!”\n-Woah!!\nAlong with the cheers, numerous flowers rained down on the match ground, but all those scenes did not inspire me at all.\nThere was only one thought swirling inside me right now; To trampleon him again in the upcoming Battle of the Territory- the great duel.\nI threw the destroyed lance to the ground and got off the horse with my helmet off.\nImmediately after that, I approached Alan Aiden and said softly to the distraught fellow floundering on his horse.\n“This is just a skirmish. I will crush you thoroughly.”\nThese were also the words to say to the evil traces, the one in front of me and the one still remained inside me and did not disappear- The same trace that I somehow managed to put to sleep while overcoming death in Rodenov in a cold winter.\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\nI felt a twinge of ominous emotion as I watched Physis move toward Alan Aiden.\n'Why? Where did this ominousness come from?'\nI expanded my vision through magic. To see Physis in more detail.\nAt that moment I could see the contempt, hatred, and violence that could not be hidden inside…\n….The Fragments of intense emotions that cannot be hidden at all.\nI was out of breath. Because it reminded me of the time he looked at me with disgust in the past.\n'What is he angry about?'\nHe said something to Alan Aiden, who seemed to be out of his mind, and trembled at the words.\nPerhaps finishing his business, Physis lifted his head as he left the arena. At that moment, my eyes met his.\nAnd anger and hatred disappear from his face, revealing a bright smile.\n'Did he get angry watching something about Alan Aiden? And why are you smiling at me?'\nI do not know. I still don’t know you Physis.\nActually, I still want to know why you changed.\nMaybe someday, the day will come when you’ll tell me the reason.\n* * *\n[Physis's POV]\nThe jousting match after defeating Alan Aiden was, in fact, trivial. But I continued my victorious streak, defeating all the knights without giving up a single point, and finally won the tournament.\nThe faces of the crowd were completely covered with astonishment, as I watched them indifferently.\nThe moderator was making a fuss, saying that a winner who did not give up even a single point was so rare that even in the history of many National Day tournaments such a case was hard to find.\nFinally, at the end of the day in the awards ceremony, I knelt down in front of the emperor and accepted the awards.\nThere were several awards; The glory of Enassa, a medal proving the winner of the tournament, a huge reward, and even the knighthood was offered instantly.\nI, who had been temporarily treated as a knight by participating in a tournament, was able to become a real knight by winning the tournament.\nGoing through all the procedures, the Emperor told me.\n“Your father will be relieved now, Physis Ortaire. You have a great talent.”\n“It is embarrassing, Your Majesty.”\n“Do not let that amazing talent go to waste, and work hard so that you can become the pride of Enadeim.”\n“I will keep that in mind.”\n“Good. Now go and enjoy the glory you have won.”\n“Yes, Your Majesty.”\nThe conversation ended with that. As the awards ceremony ended, people from both the Ortaire and Rodenov families gathered around me.\n“You did well. God, I saw you winning all the tournaments.”\nMy father laughed loudly, which was rare, and my older brother was delighted with my victory with a very satisfied expression as if he had won a lot of money.\n“Thank you, father and brother.”\nMy mother also looked at me and smiled with a proud face. Perhaps, it was because now she had something to brag about to other ladies.\nThe reaction of the family was generally the same, and the reaction of the people of Rodenov was no different from my family.\n“I can’t believe it. I was preparing a test for you for the great duel, but it turned out to be completely useless.”\n“Hahaha. Shouldn’t I give it a try though? Since the great duel is against a strong knight, it can’t be compared with him. Rather, I have to compete with the strong knights of Rodenov to be able to face the knights of Aiden without panicking in the Territory Battle. So please proceed as prepared, Your Excellency.”\n“If that’s what you want, then let's do that.”\n\"Yes.\"\n“But again congratulations on your win.”\n“It’s all thanks to Adilun.”\n“Huh? What do you think I did? It’s all that you’ve done Physis. No, I should call you Sir Physis now, right?”\nShe spoke to me in a playful manner.\n“There is no need to call it me that... Just good with only Physis, Adilun.”\n“I see. Anyway, you were great.”\n“Thank you.”\nMy family and the people of Rodenov, who had heard me and Adilun talk, moved away so that she and I could talk more comfortably.\n“Now, National Foundation Day is coming to an end. After tomorrow’s martial arts competition… ...The National Foundation Day will come to an end, and the Great Duel will begin at last. Oh, by any chance, Physis, are you also participating in the martial arts competition?”\n“Nope. I do not want to participate in martial arts competitions. Isn’t the martial arts tournament a place where people from all over the empire gather to fight to become knights? I’m tired, and since I got a knighthood today already, I’m thinking of just watching it comfortably.”\n“Aha. Okay. But Physis...”\nShe was about to say something to me, but suddenly stopped talking and bit her lip.\n“Well? What were you saying?”\n“No, nothing.”\nHowever, what was revealed in her expression as she said it was nothing was a clear uneasiness.\n“Has anything happened?”\n“It’s really nothing. Never mind.”\n“… All right.”\nShe shut her mouth as if she didn’t want to bring the topic up any longer.\n'What the hell is going on?'\n'What is it that makes you so anxious?'\nAfter a line of questions dug into my mind, a silence fell between me and Adilun.\n[TL: Join Patreon to support us and to read 3 chapters ahead of the release. ]",

      "content": "30 – Martial Arts Competition (1).\n[Physis's POV]\n'Why did Adilun make such a face?'\nThat was the first thought that came to my mind when I returned home.\nFragments of concern and anxiety, even a glimpseof some kind of fear, appeared in her expression as she looked at me for a moment.\nAnd one thing was clear to me, the reason behind that worry and anxiety must be me.\n'What is it about me that frightens you so much?'\nThinking about that I started recalling all the things that happened before.\nI defeated Alan Aiden and won the tournament.\nBut what was there to be afraid of?\nRefreshing the memories, I tried to remember what happened in those situations that made her feel uneasy.\n'I don’t know.'\nBut no matter how much I thoughtabout it, nothing particular came to my mind.\n'What made her like that? What was the reason?'\nIn the end, the whole night passed, but I couldn’t figure out the reason.\n* * *\nIt was the last day of National Foundation Day, and it was the day the martial arts competition was held.\nI decided to leave behindthe worries I had yesterday. Because it was useless for me to suffer foolishly from them.\nIt was a waste of time to force myself to worry about something which I didn't fully know. And top of that, I still had a lot of other work to do.\nThe GreatDuel was not far off. To suit that deadline, I had to train myself as much as possible.\n'It will be better to ask her about the concern later when the time is right.'\nI shook my head to clear my thoughts and immediately headed to the competition site with my family.\nPerhaps because it was the end of the National Foundation Day festival, there were far more people at the competition hall than expected.\nAs I looked at the scene of the competition, my older brother hit me on the shoulder and asked.\n“Has anything happened?”\n“No, nothing in particular.”\n“Is that so, then why your expression is so bad.”\n“I’m just a little tired.”\n“Hmm. make sense but still... Well, there is good news for you, you will be fine today as you are not participating in today's competition.”\n“Yes-yes. By the way, brother. Did you win a lot of money?”\nIn response to my question, my brother replied with a cheerful smile. It was the first time I had seen this man smiling like that.\n“Hahahaha. Of course man!”\n“Just how much money did you win? Your expression looks very happy.”\n\"Well... I didn't really lookat it... Still, it looks like I made several times more from minimum starting money. You know, In the first place, your dividend wasn't that high for the first bet. Ah! that reminded me, there will be bets for the martial arts competition too, don't you want to try it too?\"\n“Brother. That’s gambling addiction.”\n“I did not plan to spend all my won money. I just plan to use only a part of it for just this time. I have that much self-control and knowledge too.”\nIt seems that because of me he got addicted to gambling.\n“There is a question everyone asks in time like this brother...”\n\"What?\"\n\"Should the heir of the county be like that?\"\n“Huh? I’ll do it in moderation. But also is it ironic that you say that? Surely you, as far as I know, the money you blew away at the gambling house was quite good too, right?”\n“Ugh. That was not much. And haven’t I stopped now?”\n“So, since I’ve seen you, I thought I’d do it moderately, too.”\n“Anyway, I understand what you want. But I don't have any money. So I can't but you can definitely bet.”\n“Okay then, take this and try it. Most of the money I won anyway was because of you.”\nMy brother said that and handed me some of the money he won.\n“Ah really. Why are you suddenly like this?.”\n“Well, you are not even using your own money. It will be more fun than you think. As I said moderately is the key. An opportunity like this isn’t common, so let’s do it one last time as memories and for fun.”\nDespite my continued refusal, my older brother continued to urge me. I couldn’t understand or say anything anymore because the nobleman who dragged me from the gambling house and beat me up was like that.\n“Ah, I see. Oh well. Let’s just do that. But hey, what will our father say?”\n\"Nothing. He knows about it\"\n“Did he allow it? …If I said I was doing it, I think he would have grabbed my hair right away.”\n“That is the difference between basic behavior. You blew quite a bit of money on the gambling board not too long ago. I just started now… … But, even our father won’t say much about it.”\n“That’s fortunate.”\n“Great. Then let’s go!”\nThis man, he shouldn’t be this kind of person, but somehow…\n* * *\nAs I expected, the private gambling hall was full of people.\nIt was the center of all kinds of fuss, full of people asking who was the best in the best, and everyone was investing their money trusting their eyes.\nThe person who appeared to be the owner of a private gambling house spoke to us and spread out the list of participants in martial arts competitions.\n“Who do you want to bet on?”\n“Wait a minute. I think I need to look at it.”\nMy brother replied to him.\n“Alright. If you choose, please tell me.”\n“I get it. Let’s see…”\nThat’s how my older brother started looking at the list of contestants for the martial arts competition.\n“Do you know any good names?”\n“Well, people with high reputations know about it through rumors… …Because those people usually don’t pay high dividends.”\n\"If the dividend is high, you can bet safely, but if you don’t bet...\"\n\"Brother, isn’t it a bit reversed?\"\n“Usually, this is how unknown strong people come out at the end and win.”\nMy older brother said that in a confident tone, but I looked at him with pitiful eyes and said,\n“It will go bad this way, of course. Usually, people like brothers often lose. I am speaking from my experience.”\n“But... That too...”\n“Isn’t it difficult to judge something now in the first place? Why don’t we check out at least one game and come back later?”\n“Well… …Certainly, you seem oddly trusting, probably because you're a person who frequents the gambling tables.”\nIt seems that he did not want to blindly put money in a situation where there is no clear winner.\n“Anyway, How much did you plan to invest? All, like last time?”\n“No way. As I said before, I was thinking of using only as much as I had brought with me for the first time.”\nCome to think of it, that’s what he said earlier.\n“That’s fortunate.”\n“First of all, let’s watch the first game as you said.”\n“Yes. Let's go then.”\nMy brother and I arrived at the competition hall again, and when we sat down in our seats, I saw Adilun looking at the competition, wiggling her fingers.\n“Adilun? When did you come?”\n“I just came. Where have you been anyway?”\n“Ah, that… …It was a private gambling house.”\n“Yes?”\nIn an instant, Adilun's expression overlapped with the anxiety and concern I saw yesterday.\n“Ah, that… …My older brother asked me to give it a try. I was just trying to have fun with some of the money he won from my tournament winnings. And in the end, I didn’t walk out or say no to him.”\n“Ah, Prince Huian…?”\nEven after saying that, she looked at me without clearing her doubts. It was a little embarrassing, but suddenly...\n“Yeah, Princess Rodenov. I asked him to come with me to the gambling house but he did not want to go from the start. And I was doing it with extra money anyway, so whether I succeeded or failed, I thought I wouldn’t do it anymore.”\n...My brother came right in from the side and said. Thanks to the assistance of my older brother, Adilun erased her doubts and spoke to me with a visibly relieved expression.\n“Ha. That’s fortunate. I thought he hadn’t broken his old habits.”\nThe moment I saw her now relieved expression, something ran through my head.\nShe gave me an uneasy look when I told her about the gambling house and she also was worried about my old habits. If so, is the uneasiness she showed yesterday, was also due to the uneasiness of not knowing when my old self will come out?\n'But did my old self come out yesterday?' As I thought, one thing finally came to my mind.'\n'Yes! When I defeated Alan Aiden.'\nObviously, like the old me, I punished him violently and emotionally.\n'Perhaps Adilun saw through it in some way. Because she’s pretty smart.'\n“If that happen, I wouldn’t have come this far.”\n“I guess I’m thinking too hard, right?”\nTo her soft talk, I answered firmly with a smile.\n“Yes.”\n'I have to govern myself more thoroughly.'\nLooking at the relieved Adilun, I made that resolution.\n* * *\nSomeone was horriblydefeated in the arena and the victory was decided immediately.\n“The winner is! Edith Douglas!”\nThe one who destroyed the opponent with sharp swordsmanship was called Edith Douglas.\nThe martial arts competition was quite exciting; People were using all kinds of weapons, and among them, there were many people who were far superior in skills, and there were very few people who had terrible skills.\nAt first, it was not easy to predict who would win, but the spectacle just made it clear.\nPerhaps Edithhad the highest probability of winning this martial arts competition.\n\"As you said, it was nice to see the first game. If I bet my money like before, I would only lose money. First of all, I have roughly decided who to bet my money on, did you decide?\"\nWhile watching the martial arts competition, I answered my brother’s question without hesitation.\n“The one who just won. What was his name? Edith Douglas, right? If I bet money, I’ll bet on him. The winner of this martial arts competition will be him. His movement itself is different from other people.”\nMy older brother also nodded, as if he had felt something.\n“It’s like that. You can tell just by looking… Well, he is good and you have experience as well. And I think the same too.”\n“Yes certainly.”\n“Then we will have to go. Oh, the money I gave you earlier, give it back. If you’re confident, we will have to bet on him.”\n“It really is a disease. brother. I know because I did it often.”\n“Anyway, this is the last time. Really.”\nWhen my older brother said that he would bet money, Adilun was staring at me from the side, widening her eyes. As if saying if you bet your money, you will be beaten to death.\n“Well, I believe you will do well. And… …I guess I’d be better off not doing it.”\nHaving said that, the older brother obediently agreed to my response, unlike the persistent request he had made earlier.\n“Yes. Princess Rodenov is also against it, so it would be better for you and me if I do it myself alone. Anyway, I’m coming with winning money. Don’t go.”\n“Please go.”\nAdilun looked at the scene in amazement, then spoke to me.\n“That… …Is this okay?”\n“He will do well. Because he is a person who is certain to leave betting from the beginning… …He wouldn’t do it enough to be a problem. He said he would only use the money he brought in at first.”\n“Oh, that's good… …Anyway, Physis. I don’t want to see you lose money on gambling, so please don’t gamble in the future. You know?”\n“Of course, I know.”\n“Good.”\nShe was relieved again and told me.\nIn the meantime, Edith Douglas accumulated one more victory and gradually made his name known to people.\n[ TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to read 3 chapters ahead of the release:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/taylor007]",

      "content": "31 – Martial Arts Competition (1).\n[Physis's POV]\nThe martial arts competition went exactly as expected by me and my older brother. Edith Douglas built a winning streak with unusual momentum, and finally reached the pinnacle of the martial arts competition.\nIn response to his sword attack, the other participants' weapons were dislodged, and he was able to avoid all their attacks.\nThe most impressive thing was that no matter how dangerous the attack was, he always maintained a stable posture. This was impossible unless one was extremely talented.\nI realized this by looking at his swordsmanship, that he must have been formally trained. I had heard that he was the captain of a famous mercenary group, but did he receive formal training before becoming a mercenary?\nHis effortless movements did not match the swordsmanship of a mercenary's roughness who had been trained in real battles.\n“Amazing inaction, Edith Douglas!”\nAs if he expected this to happen, he enjoyed the applause of the crowd with a relaxed attitude.\n“Right!”\nBeside me, my older brother, who had won a lot this time without wasting any more money, was cheering, and I was watching that absurd spectacle.\nJust like me, Adilun, who was next to me, saw that and whispered to me.\n“Originally, does a person have to lose once to come to his senses while gambling? Or isn’t it a big deal?”\n“It is out of my hands now. I don't know what to do.”\nI said with a sigh.\n“You must never do that. If you get caught gambling later…”\n“What if I get caught later?”\nAt my question, Adliun looked at me with a creepy smile, dark expression, and bloody eyes.\n“I will send a request for a breakup.”\n“… A-ah... I will keep that in mind.”\nTo words that at first glance seem bloody, I answered seriously and honestly.\n“Wouldn't it be better to buy gifts? It's been a while since we've been to the capital, so family members will love it…”\nWhile Adilun and I were discussing the seriousness of the situation, my older brother was seriously considering what to do with the money he won.\nIt seemed that he was trying to bring some presents to the family members. Should I say that it was fortunate that the money he won is not being spent on strange things or gambling again?\nAnyway, the National Foundation Day event, which had many incidents, ended with great success, and now it was time to go back.\n'Now, I must prepare for the great duel.'\n'At this point, there is roughly a month left until the great duel. I need to improve my skills.'\n'As soon as I return to Ortaire, I will immediately devote myself to training.'\n* * *\n[Omniscient'sPOV]\nEdith Douglas was looking straight ahead with a tense expression.\nEven though he won the martial arts competition and witnessed the emperor in person, he wasn’t nervous. But now he was very nervous.\n“Good work, Edith.”\n“Thank you. Your Excellency the Duke.”\nThe one who made Edith nervous was Crocus Glosuna, Chancellor of the empire.\nHe looked at Edith with a rare happy face and said.\n“You won the martial arts competition… …Yes-yes. You took it for granted, but I am so happy to see you win in person.”\n“It’s all thanks to YourExcellency, who took care of me, supported me to become a strong warrior, and believed in me in the past.”\n“No, a martial arts competitionis a place where you can’t predict what kind of strong person will show up. In such a place, you, who won the championship by defeating many strong players, must have put in that much painstaking effort.”\n“…Yes.”\n“So that’s great.”\n“I don’t know what to do with you complimenting me beyond measure, Your Excellency.”\n“Oh, was my appreciation that long? So let’s get back to the main topic. I have work for you to do.”\n“Please tell me.”\n“You should know that Aiden and Rodenov are fighting a territory war because as I told you before.”\n“Yes, Your Excellency.”\n“As Aiden’s great warriors, you and your colleagues should help.”\n“I will do that.”\nEdith immediately knelt down and answered.\nHe didn’t ask why. No, there was no need to ask. Because Edith owes Crocus such a great favor that he would die if Crocusordered him.\n“Good night. Immediately, go to Aiden. Go and tell him, who must be probably struggling with a great duel by now, that I will help him. Do you understand?”\n“Yes. We will depart immediately.”\n“Ah. And one more thing.”\n“Yes. Please tell me.”\n“Don’t die. If you are in danger of dying, surrender and give up supporting Aiden.”\n“…I will keep that in mind.”\n* * *\n[Omniscient'sPOV]\nCrocus looked at Edith, who had left the office, and remembered the first time he saw Edith.\n‘He’s a good guy. He grew up quite nicely.’\nCrocus remembered how Aristata, who saw Edith and the children who seemed to be his poor comrades dying of starvation on the street, asked Crocus directly.\n\"Can we keep...\"\nCrocus, who was about to refuse, believed that accepting useless children from the poor would only waste the family’s resources, but then changed his mind when he saw Edith’s eyes looking at him.\nThose eyes yearn to live, they themselves enhanced the dignity of him.\nThose, who know how to crave, will grow steeply and eventually see the light. Crocus thought it would be useful if he raised him as a knight, so from then on, Crocus put his heart and soul into raising the children who were with him into strong warriors.\nYears later, the results returned spectacularly.\nHe Won the National Foundation Day martial arts competition.\nOf course, since it was a contest to find hidden gemstones and appoint them as knights, the level might be lower than that of the Imperial Knight Wars, but Edith’s level was clearly one level higher.\nEven if he participated in the imperial knight war in a few months, he won’t be easily pushed back.\n“So don’t die. You still have a long way to go. Let’s glorify Glosuna for me.”\nCrocus clenched his chin and muttered with a satisfied smile.\n* * *\n[Physis's POV]\nThe way back was the same. The only difference was that the atmosphere between me and Adilun in the carriage had relaxed a little, unlike when National Foundation Day began.\n“National FoundationDay… It was very eventful.”\nAdilun stuck her head out of the window and looked at Enassa with regretful eyes.\n“Are you feeling sad?”\n“I would be lying if I said I wasn’t sad. It was fun. I had quite a few experiences that I couldn’t have in Rodenov. Of course, I was tired as well. But I really enjoyedit.”\n“I’m glad you enjoyed it.”\n“What about you?”\n“I too enjoyed it. Perhaps the best part of all of that is that my relationship with you has gotten a little better.”\n“Well, it was because of your attitude… …Don’t lose heart though. If you show your old self again, I will show my old self too.”\n“Hahaha. I will be careful.”\nSomehow, I thought I would say something embarrassingly, but, sure enough, I stopped laughing when I saw Adilun immediately blush.\n“He-hey. Don’t laugh.”\nSomewhat cold words came out right away, so I struggled to stop laughing.\nAdilun tried to calm her reddened face, and I tried to hold back my laughter. After a moment of silence, Adilunspoke seriously.\n“It’s time for the great duel now.”\n“Yes.”\n“What are we going to do? It should have been about a month.”\n“I do not know. Since Aidendoesn’t know who to send, we should do everything we can.”\n“…Yes.”\n“And I’ll probably stop by Rodenov before the start of the great duel.”\n“Yes? oh Come to think of it, my father is conducting a test…”\n“Yes. I must be willing to respond. At least I'm going out on behalf of Rodenov, so there will have to be a minimum verification process.”\n“I don’t know what kind of test my father will give… …But cheer up. Because of my father’s personality, he will never go overboard.”\n“I am already prepared.”\n“I’m glad then.”\nAfter that, we kept our mouths shut as if we had promised we will not talk.\nMore than that, I didn’t know what to talk about. Uncomfortable with the flowing silence in the swaying carriage, I shook my head to continue the conversation.\n'What should I say?'\n'Oh!'\n'The handkerchief.'\n'Come to think of it, I still haven’t returned the handkerchief that Adilun gave me at the tournament.'\nI immediately took out a finely folded handkerchief from which has a pattern of a dragon with a sword on it my bosom. The embroidery that Adilun had placed for me was delicately revealing itself.\n“Adilun, this…”\n“… …ah.”\n“Sorry. At that time, I was distracted for a while, so I couldn’t return it.”\n“It’s okay if you don’t return that handkerchief. Because I was thinking of giving it to you anyway.”\nFor some reason, those calm words shook my heart greatly.\n“Ah, that, then.”\n“Yes. Keep it. And… …In nine months, when I can fully trust you, give it back.”\nShe was talking about the promise she and I made that day. So I replied with a smile.\n“… I hope that day can come soon.”\n“Is that so.”\n“Yes.”\n“...Me too…”\nShe said with lowering her head a little in a soft and lower voice, but I was able to hear her.\nWhat dwelled in her slightly lowered eyes was, without a doubt, a piece of hope. And her face turned red again. Adilun must have realized that too, so she turned her head and started talking to me as if making excuses.\n“I’m a bit tired, so I’ll close my eyes.”\n“Yes, Adilun. Have a good night’s sleep.”\nI smiled and turned my gaze to the window so she could rest.\n[ TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to read 3 chapters ahead of the release: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007]",

      "content": "32 – Ready (1)\nThe carriage trip ended earlier than expected.\nIt was because we got away from the capital, Enassa, and entered the territory where the teleportation gate was activated.\nBecause I was genuinely feeling sad about breaking up with Adilun, I said to her.\n“Take care of yourself.”\n“You too. Then… …See you in a month, Physis.”\n“Yes. Adilun.”\nI didn't know what was on her mind, but in the hope that everything will be okay, I returned to Ortaire.\nThe people of Ortaire happily welcomed us.\nIn particular, all of them were even more pleased to see my older brother, because of all kinds of gifts he brought for the family servants, and everyone was surprised that the money for the gifts came from me.\n“Gift money? Master Physis?”\n“Is that true?”\n“Oh that's a joke, right? Master Huian must have paid for it.”\nSeeing how they couldn’t accept that money came because of me or from me, reminded me that people still couldn’t believe in me completely.\nBut still, this was a lot better. Because they didn't even suspect that we won it by gambling somewhere.\nTo their words of saying that he must have paid for it, my older brother answered.\n“No, it is true. Do you know how Physis got the money? You will probably be even more surprised.”\n“How did you arrange it, Master Physis?”\n“Even if he told you guys, you will not believe him, so I’ll tell you. Physis won the National Day hunting competition and the jousting match.”\n“Yes?”\nExcept for the people who were directly there, most of the other servants looked wide-eyed in disbelief.\nBut the surprising thing was that some of the knights among them were nodding their heads saying that it could be true.\nThe knights personally sparred countless times with me for three months, so they seemed to recognize the fragments of my talent.\n“Is that true? Master Physis won the hunting competition and the jousting match?”\nBut the butler couldn’t believe it easily, so he asked my brother directly.\n“Yes. It’s not necessarily my testimony, it’s something father and mother witnessed too. Isn’t that right, father and mother?”\n“Yes. that's really true. Physis won both events and earned huge bounty money. However, the bounty money was not used for the gifts.”\n“Yes?”\n“Huian, this guy put all his money into private gambling, for jousting matches and martial arts competitions. And I don’t even know how many times that money was multiplied.”\n“Huh.”\nMy father said it as if it was no big deal, but all the servants were surprised.\nRather than the fact that I had won, they seemed more surprised by the fact that that diligent older brother of mine had put all of his money into private gambling.\nThey looked at my brother as if they were looking at some kind of miracle.\nIn the end, it was only after the testimony of the servants and maids who accompanied us in Enassa that people accepted that I had indeed won a hunting contest and jousting tournament.\nThus, an unexpected banquet was held in Ortaire.\nIt was a small banquet for those who accompanied us in Enassa and also guarded Ortaire in our absence.\nAfter all, everything was over, and I was finally able to take a break for while.\n* * *\nAfter the banquet was over, my father called all the family members and told us about the great duel between Rodenov and Aiden.\nAlso, the fact that I, the fiancé of Adilun, will also go out as a great warrior myself.\n“It is dangerous. No matter how allied we are, how can they put Master Physis, who will become a member of the Rodenovs in the future, as their great warrior?”\n“It's okay. Physis has the skills and he will be fine.”\nThe butler and servants said it was dangerous, but my father told them it was okay.\n“I am fine.”\n“But, Young Master.”\n“They did not put me in the great duel, I wanted to participate because this is what I ought to do. I insulted Princess Rodenov for a year. I must pay for my sins.”\n“If you say so…”\nEven the vassals, who were extremely opposed, backed down once my father and I spoke firmly.\n“Don’t worry too much. Physis will do just fine.”\nSince my father, the strongest knight in Ortaire and the swordsman of the Empire, supported me so much, even the vassals eventually had no choice but to nod and resign.\nAfter they withdrew, my father spoke to me.\n“Are you really going to be okay?”\n“Yes. Trust me. Three months. In these only three months, I gradually accumulated victories and realized mana in sparring with knights.”\n“Yes. I have nothing more to say about your talents. However, as long as we don’t know who will emerge as Aiden’s great warrior, carelessness and arrogance are prohibited. Do you understand?”\n“I will keep that in mind. Then, Father, I will go now.”\n“Are you going for the training?”\n“Yes.”\n“Then let me help you. The family knights won’t put much pressure on you anymore. You have to be at least like me to be able to do anything in a real fight. And on top of that, I’m not too busy today, and I’ve handed over the small paperwork to Huian, so it should be fine.”\n“I really feel pitiful for brother.”\n“What? Shouldn’t the successor do all of those things? Well, Let’s go now.”\n“Yes, Father.”\nMy father immediately led me to the gymnasium.\n* * *\n“I heard from the knights. You don’t use a separate weapon?”\n“Yes.”\n“May I ask why?”\n“There is no particular reason… …It’s because it’s more comfortable to extend a fist than to swing a sword.”\n“I’ve been taught the family’s swordsmanship since childhood… … . Anyways. If swordsmanship doesn’t suit your hand, it might be better to just practice martial arts. Each has its pros and cons.”\nAfter my father finished speaking, he immediately took up his posture.\nMaybe he didn’t use mana separately, because I didn’t feel the airflow of mana.\nBut, just standing with a sword...\nThat alone was so terrifying that it weighs me down.\nI endured the pressure and raised my mana.\nA torrent of mana swirls around my body, making my body that was weighed down by the pressure much lighter.\n-Thud!\nI stomped my feet and took a step forward.\nAt that moment, the pressure of my father, which had been weighing me down, broke away.\nFor an instant, a strangeness dwells in my father’s eyes and he said to me.\n“It’s quite good. It’s unbelievable that it’s only been three months. Seeing it in person gives me a new feeling.”\nI hadn’t even raised my fist yet, but it felt like everything about me was being read.\nMaybe he can even see it as natural. My talent for mana must have come from my father.\n“I will stay still, come and attack me.”\nI didn’t even answer, I ran toward my father’s sword. But my father swung the wooden sword without even exerting much force.\nIt was just a simple swing, but I could see it; The way the sword was going, was covering my entire face.\nThere was nowhere to escape.\nThe moment I clumsily chose to evade, that roughly swinging sword would immediately hit my body.\n'Then. I have to face it, not avoid it.'\nWithout hesitation, I wrapped mana around my gauntlet and threw out my fist with all my might. The cleanest punch I could do collided with my father’s wooden sword.\nAnd in that moment.\n-Quaang!\nAn unbelievable roar echoed from the collision between a training wooden sword that was not even wrapped in mana and a gauntlet that was wrapped in a torrent of mana.\n-Crisp...\nAnd… … The steel gauntlets that wrapped around my fists and arms cracked and shattered. But, the training wooden sword that my father held in his hand was fine.\n“I lost.”\n“Excellent.”\nI spoke calmly, and my father spoke in a satisfied tone.\n“I like your eyes. You saw clearly where my sword was headed.”\n“Yes.”\n“If you weren’t qualified, you would have judged that it was just a rough swing and tried to evade. And it would have come off awkwardly. But you confronted me head-on… … At least you reached my wooden sword. Am I right?”\n“Exactly, Father.”\nAt my answer, my father said in admiration.\n“You have a precious eye. Aptitude for mana, physical perfection… … There are countless kinds of talents you have, but those eyes are probably the biggest axis of your talents.”\n“You’re right.”\n“Hahahaha. I will ever feel jealous of my son, I never imagined that. Why did you wander until now with eyes like that?”\n“It’s good that I'm awake now, isn’t it?”\n“That is correct. I was puzzled because I had heard so much from the knights, but now I understand. You are a genius. Who in the world would object to you being a genius? Ten years? No, in five years you will catch up with me, and in ten years there will be no one comparable to you on this vast continent.”\n“Isn’t that an overestimation, Father?”\n“Three months. With just three months of training, no one dared to touch my wooden sword. I have met countless people who have been called geniuses. Even those people couldn’t reach my wooden sword in just three months.”\n“… …”\n“I will have to watch your training often from now on.”\n“Is that all right?”\n“No matter how busy I am, I can make time for that. Also, isn’t there Huian? It’s not because of the great duel. Now it's just a matter of my personal greed.”\n“What will my brother think?”\n“Do you think he would be jealous of something like that?”\n“… …No”\n“Huianmoves anything out of necessity. It’s just that his disposition is right and upright, so the part corresponding to ‘necessity’ doesn’t go out of order. He will welcome you with open arms when you become stronger. There will be many places to use you.”\n“Well, it certainly seems so.”\n“The reason why I immediately picked Huianas the successor is a bigger reason. Yes, It would be nice to have strong arms to lead the family, but that is only secondary. Huianis a child with the ability to be a leader. He knows how to embrace his own people, and he knows how to identify talented people.”\n“As expected.”\n“Yes. So don’t worry.”\n“Alright.”\n“Please come here every day from now on. Time will be… … Yes. Morning. After my guidance is over, you may engage in sparring with the knights, or you may train as you please... If you have any stamina left.”\n“Alright. It’s not too long before the great duel.”\n“Yes. There is no need to worry about the great duelanyway. Because there is still one month left. Perhaps in the meantime, you will become amazingly strong.”\nAt my father's words, I just nodded without speaking.\n[ TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to read 3 chapters ahead of the release: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007]",

      "content": "33 – Uneasiness.\n[Adilun's POV]\nRodenov still greeted me with a cold, bitter wind.\nAfter exiting the teleport gate, the appearance of Caltix Fortress came into full view; A place covered with freezing ice, yet still filled with the warmth of those who live in it.\nIt wasn’t flashy or lively like Enadeim, but just looking at this iron-clad fortress gave me some peace of mind.\nNo matter how splendid and mysterious the appearance of the capital was, it seemed that it did not evoke as much emotion as the place where I was born and raised.\n'Home. Yes, it is my home.'\nIt was a peacefulness that I hadn't felt in a long time.\nMy father told the members of Caltix Castle about Aiden and the great duel.\nThey were angry at Aiden for insulting me and prepared to condemn them.\nMy father also announced to the knights that Physis had been selected as the great warrior of Rodenov, but the knights showed considerable dissatisfaction.\nBut soon after when they heard that he had won the hunting competition and jousting match and that, he had condemned Alan Aiden for insulting me, that dissatisfaction subsided a little.\nInstead, they nodded at my father’s words that father would have to test Physis' qualifications to become a great warrior, and asked my father how he would test him.\nMy father said that he would judge Physis’ qualifications by sparring with the knights of Rodenov.\nBecause of that, the knights burned with even more passion and started training repeatedly to improve their skills. It was because they saw it as an opportunity to legally beat Physis, who they always wanted to beat, as well as they could get selected as a great warrior in the great duel.\nMeanwhile, I locked myself in my room and rested.\nBut perhaps the servants were considerate of me when I returned, because they did not make a fuss and took care of me so that I could rest comfortably, and I really liked that consideration.\nBecause I needed time to organize my thoughts.\nIt was only a short few days, but the things that happened at the National Foundation Day festival, sowed shame and relief, and anxiety and fear in me at the same time.\nHe has changed. I just didn’t want to admit it, but he had definitely changed.\nJust by the way his family treated him, it was evident how he had been for the three months since he had been kicked out of Rodenov.\nThe people of Ortaire, who had previously regarded him as something troublesome, now believed in him.\n'Can one gain people’s trust in three months?'\nAnd being able to win back such trust from those who have lost all trust in him, proved that he had worked very hard.\nAlso, his attitude towards me was much more different, to the point of believing that he was a completely different person.\nEven when I pushed him in my confusion, he apologized to me with sincere apologies and swore in front of me that he would never do that again.\nIn fact, I didn't know how many times I tore off the covers that night out of embarrassment. To say such an embarrassing thing casually.\nSince then he started worrying about me all the time.\nHe beat Alan Aiden who had insulted me and said he would directly fight for me, and even when monsters attacked the princesses during the hunting competition, he took care of me first.\nOn the day we watched the festival together after the jousting match when he looked at me wearing a mask, he put on a guilty expression.\nHe cared about me enough to even think of inviting me to the festival might have made me uncomfortable.\nI was really happy to see that expression.\nBecause of that, I was able to trust him more… … All the while, I hoped he wouldn’t change again.\nSo I made a promise.\nIf he maintains a consistent attitude for the next nine months, let’s erase all the wrongs we’ve done to each other and go back to square one.\nBut in a corner of my heart, there was still a feeling of unease.\n'Why did he change?'\nBecause the root cause was still unknown.\nChange always comes with a purpose. People change when they have a purpose.\nBut I couldn’t guess even the slightest reason why he had changed.\nIt had only been two days at that time since he went back with a disgusted face saying he didn’t want to see me right now. I couldn’t understand him changing his attitude again after only two days.\nThat fact made me uneasy. I felt like he could go back to his old attitude whenever he wanted.\nThe mind to trust him and the mind not to trust him collided.\n'What if, after 9 months, he suddenly changed again? What if he looked at me with feeling of anger and disgust as before?'\n'Will I be able to stand it?'\n* * *\nI can see the figure of Physis in front of my eyes.\nHe looks at me with the friendly smile that he had shown me so often lately.\nAnd I was pleased because he smiles like that for me now.\nThe negative emotions that had always stood on his face in the past had turned into positive emotions before I knew it, and were heading toward me.\nWe walked hand in hand. The stories that popped out were trivial, but that alone made us laugh happily.\n'Happy...'\nIf the companion I will be with for the rest of my life is a person who cares for me, I will be happy.\nI grabbed him and led him. What we saw in front of us was the bell tower of Caltix Fortress.\nThis was my favorite place, where I could see the vast CaltixFortress at a glance. Someday, I always wanted to introduce it to someone who would be with me sincerely.\nHe seemed surprised by the appearance of the bell tower. He smiled and look at me. I also smiled and lead him by my hand.\nAfter climbing quite a lot of stairs, we came up on my favorite scenery; The appearance of the imagistic Caltix Fortress and the people living in it was revealed.\nI set with him on the ledge of the bell tower. He dissuaded me saying it was dangerous, but I told him not to worry and that I was fine.\nThe biting wind brushed through my scales. Even that was good. This cold wind that made me aware that I was alive was the foundation of my life.\nI gently revealed that it was my favorite scenery.\nHe also smiled and said.\n“Did you lead me here for this plain sight? It’s ridiculous.”\n'Ridiculous.'\nHe said with an audible, harsh, hateful voice.\n“What makes you laugh so well? Just looking at that disgusting face of yours makes me feel sick. Hey, you monster..”\n'No. I’m not a monster.'\nHe muttered in dismay.\n“Not a monster? Hahahaha. You are at least funny. Just look at yourself.”\nHe forcibly lifted my arm and put it in my field of vision.\n“Does a woman have scales? Do humans have horns? No. No.”\nWith anger came sorrow.\n“Don’t pretend to be a human, monster. Just looking at you is disgusting.”\n'Scary.'\nI was suddenly scared of the abrupt change of the person who had smiled at me just recently.\nHis denial of my existence made me so sad.\n“Ah, uh…”\nI started crying.\n* * *\n“…ah.”\nOpening my eyes. I saw the familiar look of my bedroom.\n“Dream. It was a dream.”\nI mumble blankly and soon wiped the tears flowing from my eyes.\n“Ah, uh.”\nBut the tears didn't stop.\n'Why? It’s just a dream. Why won’t the tears stop?'\n'Because I hate my own weakness? Because I don’t like the way I look?'\n'Am I afraid of the way he might change someday?'\nI didn't know. Anxiety continued to eat me from inside.\nRather, the kindness he had shown recently made me even more anxious. If he continued to show me a friendly side, I didn’t even know how would I react when he changes.\nI wouldn’t be able to bear it if he showed me his old self again in that situation.\n'If only I was beautiful. If I was more beautiful than anyone else from a human point of view...'\n'Could I not have worried about this?'\nTwo large horns on my head. Blue-white scales covered my entire body.\nSeeing a person who can’t be called a human at all, I ended up having a question.\nI....\n.....am a human, right?\n[ TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to read 3 chapters ahead of the release: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007]",

      "content": "34 – Ready (2).\n[Physis's POV]\nA month passed by very quickly. So far I did only one thing and that was to push myself and improve my skills.\nAs promised, my father kept practicing with me, and because of that, my skills grew at a tremendous pace. However, I didn't need to learn how to handle mana or skills ​​from my father.\nBut, practicing with someone stronger than me quickly showed me what I was lacking, and pointed me in the direction I needed to go.\nI did not neglect the training of my body and mana and devoted my entire time to training except for sleeping time. Even though in the past training I didn't really get tired from pretty much anything. But now with my father, I too felt tired and usually fell asleep. And when I woke up, I went straight to the gymnasium again.\nAnd just like that, the time of one month had finally passed, and now none of Ortaire’s knights could beat me anymore.\nSo during today's training, my father seriously looked at me and took a pose. Seeing him like that, I too, took a stand against him.\n'It has already been a month. I should be used to it now, but every time I confront him, it feels new.'\nThe development was always the same. Seonsaeng used a wooden sword for training. And I used a steel gauntlet.\n[TL: Seonsaeng is the Korean word for addressing someone like a teacher. ]\nI kicked off my feet and ran to my father.\nA speed that couldn't be compared to a month ago.\nThe results of my training were so noticeable that I could tell just by running on the ground.\nPerhaps my father also realized that he couldn’t pass my blows carelessly anymore, so unlike before, when he swung roughly, he struck me with a firm yet stable attitude.\n-Kawangggg!\nWith the sound of wooden swords and steel gauntlets clashing, a strong shockwave came out and spread around my father.\nA different aspect than a month ago. I stretched out my fist and blocked my father’s outstretched sword. The advantage of martial arts was that the range of techniques that could be applied expanded as long as the distance was safe.\nI tried to grab my father’s sword with my hand, but my father didn’t take it easy either. In the interval when he took two steps back, my father’s sword regained freedom and again began to encircle me.\nI could clearly see the path of my father’s sword movements, but my body couldn’t keep up with it. Even when I increased my speed with mana, I couldn’t keep up.\nThe slow flow of several movements finally completed the sword master's drawing. I knew it was only a sword pointed at me, but at least that was felt to me.\nThat sword could be moved in any way and could change and adapt to any power. Perhaps, if I were my father’s enemy, and had moved one step further, my neck would have immediately fallen off. Realizing that fact, I immediately loosened my posture and said.\n“I lost.”\n“… …Yes. Good work.”\nAs expected, the title of swordmaster was not a title that could be obtained in months or days.\nThe body and skills that my father perfected through decades of training were impossible for me to catch up with.\nIf I had the body of my previous life, I would have been able to overwhelm my father, but my current body was only trained for 4 months. There was no way I could catch up with him right now.\nMoreover, my father still has a lot of energy left. The strength of the body, the total amount of mana, and purity were all far away from me now, so I couldn’t dare to look at them.\nNo matter how overwhelming talent was, even if it shortens the time, decades of equally talented people could not be easily surpassed.\nBut I didn’t regret it. It was natural. If I regret it, there won’t be any improvement.\nOne can only improve when one realised and accepted their shortcomings and flaws.\nIt was rather good. Because now I had the conviction that I could become stronger than I was.\nHowever, it won’t take long.\n“You found the gap. I can’t believe it.”\n“Yes, I saw it. But my body couldn’t keep up.”\n“If your body had been at a little higher level, you could have grabbed the sword. That’s enough. Probably, no matter who comes out in the great duel, they won’t be able to surpass you.”\n“But I am not going to let my guard down. The world is wide, and there are many strong people. There may be some variables.”\n“Right. Aiden’s prestige has declined considerably, and it has become a merchant family, but in the past, it was a family that produced noble knights. It’s a great mindset.”\n“Then we will finish our preparations and depart for Rodenov tomorrow. There are still three days until the great duel.”\n“Yes. Do as you please.”\n“Thank you, father. You really worked hard with me.”\nMy father nodded and went back to the office. I started packing right away.\n'Finally tomorrow. I’m heading to Rodenov.'\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\nIt was a particularly cold day.\nToday was the day when Physis’ warrior qualifications were going to be verified.\nBut somehow, my mood continued to be bad. Over the past months, everyone asked me what was going on with my bad mood, but I simply replied that it was nothing.\nEveryone was puzzled at how I, who had been lively just before National Foundation Day, had become so gloomy, but when I shut my mouth without giving any reason, everyone just chose to leave me alone.\nIn fact, both of our choices were right. My bad mood was all because of the dream and the insecurity that had settled in me.\nThose things, no matter what other people said, weren't helpful at all.\nIt was something I needed to control myself and overcome, but I was just not able to do that.\nWhat I had to do now was to control my emotions. Hiding insecurities, I forced my bad mood to hide.\nAfter I had prepared myself mentally, Sarah came to me and informed me that Physis had arrived.\n“Then, let's go, Sarah.”\n“Yes, miss.”\n* * *\n[Physis's POV]\n“Long time no see. Adilun.”\n“… …Yes.”\nAdilun, whom I hadn’t seen in a month, somehow seemed to have no energy. And that’s not all. Not only did she have no energy, but she also looked depressed.\nIt seemed like she was trying hard not to show it, but it was clear that something bad had happened to her recently.\n“Hey, Adilun?”\n“Yes?”\n“Is there something wrong? You don’t look good.”\n“… …It-it’s okay.”\nShe hesitated a little.\nIt was clear that something had happened.\n“I don’t think it’s okay.”\n“It’s okay.”\nCool, yet determined eyes were directed at me.\nEven so, golden eyes showed uneasiness that could not be hidden. It was the eyes of a ruthless dragon that would not allow even a single question.\n“… … If so. Al-alright.”\n'What happened?' My expression automatically darkened.\n“Let's just go. Because my father is waiting for you.”\n“Yes.”\nAdilun led me to the gymnasium. At the gymnasium, the knights of Rodenov, including His Excellency Duke Johannes, stood in line.\n“Here you are.”\n“Yes.”\n“Did you train hard?”\n“I did the best I could. My father helped a lot too. And He is also sure that with my skills, there will be no problem in the great duel.”\nAt my seemingly bold words, His Excellency’s eyes lit up.\n“Hoo! Giltheon said that.”\n“Yes.”\n“Tha's good. However, for Giltheon’s assurances to recognize you as the great warrior of Rodenov, the knights’ resistance will be considerable.”\nAt that moment, along with the pressure, the knight's bloody hostility turned toward me.\nAlthough my relationship with Adilun had improved recently, from their point of view, I was still a disrespectful person who insulted the heir of the family.\n“Are you ready to take the test, Physis Ortaire?”\nI was prepared. The resolution was already made a long time ago. If I hadn’t been determined, I wouldn’t have worked so hard for a month.\n'However, was it necessary to point out such a fact?'\nIf one was determined, just one word was enough.\n“Yes.”\n“Prepare. From now on, I will test you to see if you are worthy to be selected as the Great warrior of Rodenov.”\nI nodded at those words and put on my armament.\nThe test method was simple.\nIt was to compete with the strongest knight that Rodenov boasts of.\nIf my level did not reach the standard set by them, I will have to pack my bags and return to Ortaire, and if I reach the standard, I will become a warrior of Rodenov.\nThe simplest, most accurate way.\nI didn't know how much of a reference point they had assigned to me, but if there was one thing that was certain; It was that I will far exceed the standard set by them.\nI put on the gauntlet in the middle of the gymnasium and finished arming myself.\nMy opponent was a middle-aged man with a sharp look.\nThe strongest knight in Rodenov, Sir Lucas Wintes.\nHe was otherwise called the Knight of Winter, and of course, he was not as powerful as my father, but he was a knight with great skills.\nHe immediately looked at me and gave off quite a menacing spirit.\nEventually, he raised his sword and took a stance.\n“Be ready!”\nHe rushed at me with elation.\n[ TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to read 3 chapters ahead of the release: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007]",

      "content": "35 – Wants\nThe mana wrapped around Sir Lucas' sword emanated a power that was unusual to see. The sword had a cold chill that stung as he charged.\nLike a snowstorm in the middle of winter.\n- Caang!\nIn the moment of the clash, I felt cold coursing through my gauntlet. Apparently, the nickname 'Winter Knight' was given to him according to the nature of his mana.\n'Mana embracing the cold chill.'\nCome to think of it, I've heard that there were people born in the north who were born blessed with winter and awakened mana with chilliness, and Sir Lucas seemed to inherit such a lineage.\nBut that cold did not make my body sluggish. Because I drove away his mana through my mana flowing in the gauntlet.\nWhat followed was a clash between steel gauntlets and a sharp sword.\nThe sound of steel clashing with steel resonated, and attacks aiming at each other dwelt with each step. When I took half a step back, Sir Lucas' swung his sword cover in frosty mana and aimed at my neck.\nIt was not good to withdraw like this when the gap should be closed. I immediately crouched down and took another step forward to approach him. The condition for martial arts to be advantageous was when you were closest to your opponent.\nAt least I had to interfere so that Sir Lucas’ sword could not be freed.\nSir Lucas was also not comfortable. As I tried to approach him, he crouchedand positioned himself to strikeat me.\nAnd the moment he approached me, I caught his every action.\nIt wasn’t hard to figure out the path of his attack because I could see where his muscles, his arms, and he himself were going.\nWhat Sir Lucas was aiming for was my right collarbone. It was the place where he could hit the hardest because I was in a relatively low position.\nUnlike my father’s swordsmanship, which could not be blocked even if it was seen, for Sir Lucas’ sword, I was able to respond immediately the moment I saw it.\nTwisting my upper body, I dodged his sword. However, this could not be seen as completely dodging his attack.\nHe also went through countless battles.\nOf course, it must have been a sword attack made with the assumption that I could avoid it.\nAs I expected, the blade of the sword that struck me was twisted in an instant and aimed at my upper body.\nIt was proof of his skill and strength. It took a lot of skill and strength to change the direction of the sword that was already outstretched.\nJust as he wasn’t easygoing, I wasn’t lax enough to fall under the expected attack. So I immediately hit Lucas’ sword blade with my right fist.\n-Bangg!\nThe moment mana collided with mana, a shockwave erupted and his sword rose high\nHowever, he was not taken aback and immediately tried to straighten his stance, but it took a while to recover, probably because of the shock of the sword bouncing off.\nI took a step towards the gap and finally succeeded in getting him into my range.\n-Kqwanggg!\nAs I punched his armor without hesitation, a violent thump was heard and he staggered back.\nI could have followed immediately and attacked him, but I didn’t. Because I knew this wasn't the time.\nHe must be a skilled knight, and if I had caught up with him in my spirit, I would have been struck by his sword right away.\nBasically, the moment I had to be most careful in dealing with such knights was the moment I was sure the opponent was hit by my attack.\nHe regained his stance fairly quickly despite being punched by me. Also. If I clung to him without thinking, I would have been knocked out by his counterattack.\n“You are quite good.”\nAs if being hit by me was getting on his nerves, his mood suddenly changed.\nAs expected, there was no way a knight who was said to be the strongest in the north would fall so easily.\n-Saaaaaa!\nThe mana that covered his sword gradually started to freeze like frost with a horrifying sound. And that was not all. The momentum of his body was on a different level than before.\nThe surface of his armor was covered in frost, and the cold air emanating from his body reached as far as I was.\nAnd finally, he stepped forward.\n- Quaang!\nThe ground cracked with an explosion, and in an instant, his body appearedin front of my eyes.\nFortunately, my eyes caught his movements, so I was able to momentarily raise my arm to block his sword strike, but my body bounced away.\nThe strong impact shook my body belatedly, and cold air from his sword began to raiseup my arms.\n“Did you stop this too? That’s ridiculous.”\nHe laughed out loud.\n“Let's stop here. Wasn’t it okay because we exchanged blows with each other once? What’s more, the coldness that penetrated your arms… … Wouldn't that be quite painful? At this point, the limit has been reached, so let’s stop.”\nBut then, Sir Lucas said something funny.\n'Let’s just end it like this?'\n'Nonsense'\nSir Lucas thought that at this point I would readily admit defeat. It means that he had measured my limits infinitely low.\n'Who wants that?'\n“No.”\n“What?”\n“Let's fight. It’s not over yet. Can you really call this a test?”\nI had not lost yet, and I had not proven my qualifications yet. How could I prove my qualifications with just one exchange?\n'The cold has penetrated your arm. Let’s stop?' What does that matter? I wrapped mana around my body to drive away the cold.\n“Hmm.”\nHe looked at me with an interest and soon showed the same aggressive ferocity as before.\nThe frost on the sword became even clearer, and a blizzard began to blow around him.\n“I like this. Yes. I didn’t take your test for it to just end like this.”\nI also raised my mana, strengthened my will, and burned my intense fighting spirit.\nThe strongest knight in the north?\nEven if I am weak in my current life, I had a record of being at peak in the terrible world I lived in my previous life.\nIt was unacceptable to be trivial in a place like this.\nI opened my eyes straight. My eyes, which were incomparable to any other abilities that existed in my previous life, opened right away to face the world.\nAll of the opponent’s information was captured by them, and even the flow of mana swirling around Sir Lucas began to come into my view. Time passed slowly as if distorted.\nIn it, I awakened a sense of complete control over my body like in my previous life. I recalled how the body and mana, which had already reached completion, moved and what kind of power they exerted.\nThat alone was a considerable load on the body.\nJudging from the fact that I felt the pressure on my muscles and bones right away, I wouldn't be able to maintain this state for very long.\nHowever, it would be enough to defeat Sir Lucas at least once.\nI set my posture and moved. In an instant, the scenery around me changed. Before I knew it, I saw Sir Lucas’ embarrassed face in front of me.\nHe convulsively stretched out his frost-encrusted sword, but I dodged the sword strike with one simple movement, and in the end, his sword cut through the air without reaching me.\nThe moment the sword strike failed to reach me, a clear gap was revealed in his body.\nIn the meantime, I slammed a mighty punch into his armor.\n- Kwaaang!\nIn an instant, his body bounced off into the distance, shattering the gauntlets mounted on my fists. Through the flying debris, I could see Sir Lucas’ terribly strewn figure.\nAnd...\nAll the knights around me who had been dissatisfied with me fell into silence.\nIt was a truly refreshing moment.\nMy body ached as if it would break at any moment.\nCollapsing out on the floor of the cold gymnasium, I smiled heartily.\n* * *\n[Johannes's POV]\nJohannes could not believe what had just happened.\nLucas... After experiencing numerous battles with monsters, he survived and was now a knight representing Rodenov.\nHe was at least a knight worthy of discussing the qualifications of being a Sword Saint within a few years.\nBut such a knight was defeated by a young man who was only about 20 years old? No one would believe that.\nNo, on the contrary, they would be angry at him for deceiving them.\nBut the unbelievable happened right in front of his eyes.\nJohannes was not a knight, but a magician.\nAnd because he was a member of the Rodenovs who inherited dragon blood, he was able to recognize what had just happened inside Physis.\n‘In an instant, he freely controlled the power that far exceeded his limits. It must be the aftermath why he has now collapsed. but… … does this make sense? No, in the first place, how can he handle the power that goes beyond his limits?’\nA limit was a line set for human beings. That was why most people recognize their ability within the set line, and live with it.\n'Only within your own line.'\nNo, in the first place,many people did not even clearly identify their limits. And always just struggled with it.\nOccasionally, there were some stories of far-off genius who exceed their limits but there was no case of momentarily exceeding the limit.\nAlso, even such people could not freely handle the power beyond their limits in the end.\n'But… …what the hell is this young man.'\n'How can he clearly recognize his limits and freely handle the power beyond those limits?'\nEverything was full of confusion, but even Johannes knew one thing.\nThat his daughter’s fiancé, whom he thought was just an idiot, was actually an incomprehensible genius who exceeded everyone's expectations.\n“Hahahahahaha...”\nTruly, he laughed out of embarrassment.\n[ TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to read 3 chapters ahead of the release: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007]",

Wasn’t he the warrior who fought back against countless monsters and protected Rodenov?\nA man like that was knocked out by one blow from Physis, who recently turned 20.\nLying on the floor of the cold gymnasium, he was just smiling.\nBut that smile didn’t last too long. His expression began to contort with pain as if the pain was rising.\nI could tell from a glance that he was quite overdoing it, so I hurriedly approached him and asked.\n“Is it okay?”\n\"Y-yes...\"\n“Ugh, no. It’s not okay. It seems like you’re overdoing it.”\n“Ha.”\nI sighed and gathered mana in my hand. Mana moved as I wished and seeped into his body. Little by little, seeing his expression straighten, it seemed that mana was successfully relieving his pain.\n“How are you now?”\n“It has improved a lot. Thank you.”\n“Then why are you so overdoing it? If you had just met the standard, you would have been selected as a great warrior anyway. Isn’t that rather bad? It’s not much time before the great duel from now…”\n“I do not know. I just… … I just wanted to see how far I could go.”\n“Is that so?”\n“Yes.”\n“Okay, the treatment is over… …Can you wake up?”\nAt my question, he nodded wordlessly. He got up from his seat and said with a slightly terrified expression.\n“Well, if this is the case, the battle will now be finalized… … I can destroy that unlucky family. Anyway, Adilun, thank you for treating me. I’ll get well soon thanks to you.”\nA smile that seemed happy at first glance gave vent to the uneasinessthat was building up inside me.\nThe question, which was started by the expression he had shown, now became a thought.\nIs it true that what I thought had changed in him actually did not change? Could it be that the kindness he had shown me was a lie?\nIn doubt, I had no choice but to remain expressionless as if nothing had happened.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nPhysis was able to be selected as the Great Warrior without any objections.\nEven after being selected as a great warrior, he repeatedly sparred with the knights of Rodenov in the gymnasium.\nLooking at him rolling around in the gymnasium every day, I could tell how serious he was about the great duel.\nMy father and Sir Lucas were looking at him with satisfaction.\nThe most surprising one was Sir Lucas.\nDespite the crushing defeat, he humbly accepted it and seemed satisfied that Physis was a genius.\nHe must have thought that if he became Rodenov’s son-in-law, Rodenov would become even more stronger. He always emphasized his loyalty to Rodenov as a knight.\nOverall it was a good thing, and it was something that I should be happy about.\nI reflected on what I was recently doing.\nPhysis had always been kind to me since the day he apologized to me, and he even tried to punish those who insulted me.\nEven though I spet out useless complaints and poured out the confusion at the banquet on him, he calmed me down without any annoyance or dislike.\nClearly, at The National Foundation Day, he was an extremely kind and good person even if judged objectively.\nBut… … The brute force, anger, and hatred he displayed in the tournament continued to pierced my heart like a small thorn.\nHe didn’t even show me any violent look, so why am I so anxious? If he showed a violent side to the one who insulted me, I should rather rejoice.\nI didn't know why? but an unknown kind of uneasiness continued to weigh me down.\nThat was why I wanted to talk to Physis.\n'Are you sincerely treating me like this, or is it a made-up lie?'\nBut because of the vague fear that Physis might suddenly change his attitude after hearing my story, I couldn’t possibly tell Physis about it.\nWhile I was trembling with anxiety for no reason, the great duel was gradually approaching.\n* * *\n[Dillard Aiden'sPOV]\n“What the heck, what the hell am I supposed to do…”\nAiden’s master, Earl Dillard Aiden, trembled with fear. It was because Aiden’s fate depended on the territory battle tomorrow.\nIt was already a thing of the past that Aiden was a renowned knight family.\nNow it was just a place to play with merchants and money, so there were no more famous knights in Aiden.\nIt was not like Aiden was without knights, but compared to the knights of Rodenov, they were lacking in every way, such as; skills and loyalty.\nBecause of that, there were not even those who dared to become a great warriors.\nEven if Dillard, who couldn’t see that situation, tried to recruit talented knights with a largeamount of money, since the battle between Aiden and Rodenov’s territories had already spread throughout the empire, no one had rushed to join Aiden.\nDillard walked around the office nervously and somehow got his head rolling. However, no matter how much he thought about it, the right answer didn’t come out.\n“If I had known it would be like this, I should have picked up some of Alan’s habits… … .”\nAs he was slumped down in his chair, his whole body drained of strength, staring at the empty space with cloudy eyes, he suddenly heard the butler’s voice.\n“Lord!”\n“… …What is it now?”\n“The winner of the Martial Arts competition, Edith Douglas, has arrived!”\n“What?”\nMartial contest winner? Why would such a person come here?\nDoubts arose, but Dillard got out of the office for now. Many questions came to his mind but he felt like, right now, he had to grab at least a straw for the continuation of his family.\nWhen Dillard came out, he bumped into Edith.\n“Are you Edith Douglas?”\n“That’s right. Count Dillard Aiden.”\n“What brought you here?”\n“It is to become Aiden’s great warrior. You haven't found a warrior yet, right?”\n“Why? Why Aiden? There must be many places you can go?”\n“I enjoy confrontation with the strong. Let’s say it… … The knights of Rodenov are so strong. To the extent that it can be compared to the knights of Ortaire in the East.”\n“Right. They are the ones who cannot be ignored, and they are the strong ones. Didn’t you already know enough to come to me?”\nAt Dillard’s words, Aiden nodded.\n“Will you accept me as your great warrior?”\nDillard was troubled. Most likely, the reason Edith came all the way here must have been for some purpose. but… …he couldn’t refuse either.\nEdith was the winner of the National Day martial arts competition. It was said that he would become a great warrior with much more power, so Dillard, who couldn’t even select a great warrior because he had no knights, couldn’t bear to refuse.\n“… …Please Save Aiden.”\n“Good. However, there are a few conditions.”\nEdith put on a deep smile and told Dillard what he wanted.\n* * *\n[Physis's POV]\nThe day of the great duel was bright.\nPeople’s faces were full of tension, and I could see Adilun nervously shaking her hands from time to time as well.\n“Are you okay?”\n“Ah yes. What about you, Physis?”\nShe quickly put her hand together and then asked me back.\n“Hmmm… …Fine. I’m not particularly nervous.”\n“Don’t get hurt.”\n“Do not worry too much. I won’t get hurt.”\n“… …Yes.”\nPerhaps she was a little uneasy, she grabbed my sleeve and spoke to me anxiously. At first glance, the words seemed like a request, so I nodded and eased her concerns.\nThe site where the duel would take place was the Caltix Fortress in Rodenov. That was, where we were. It was Aiden who insulted first, so Rodenov could decide the place.\nSooner or later, the knights of Aiden and their leader would be heading here via the teleportation gate.\nThe chosen warriors were me, Sir Lucas, and three other Rodenov knights.\nThe duel between the great warriors would be continued until all the knights on either side were defeated.\nThe duel was as follows:\nFirst, Two knights would be chosen from both sides and the winner between them would continue to face the next knight.\nBy the time the knights of Rodenov were waiting after completing their preparations, Finally, the knights, including the lord of Aiden, teleported at CaltixFortress.\n“Here you are.”\n“… …”\nThe old lord of Aiden, Dillard Aiden, was just looking at us with a hard face.\nBehind him, familiar faces could be seen. Alan Aiden and… … Edith Douglas.\n'Wait, Edith Douglas?'\n'Why is that guy here? Did Aiden hire him?'\nIt was a bit surprising, but there was no particular problem. No matter who came forward, I decided that I will just do my best.\nThe various procedures passed in an instant, and we set out to the vast plain outside the Caltix Fortress.\nOn the plains covered with white snow, various ceremonies centered on the greetings of the imperial family continued, and personnel dispatched from the imperial family appeared one after another to confirm the outcome of the duel.\nAnd that wasn’t all.\nFrom Ortaire, my older brother came to check if I successfully fought in the Great Warrior duel, and several central nobles who had already heard the news of the Territory War arrived at the Caltix Fortress.\nIn that chaotic situation, both sides had finished all preparations, and finally, the duel between the great warriors was about to begin.\nSince I was the first great warrior in Rodenov, I put on the black armor my older brother handed me during the jousting match, and set out into the middle of the plain.\nOn Aiden’s side, a fully armed knight came up to me and faced me with a great commotion.\nJudging by his physique, he wasn’t Edith Douglas, probably one of the other great fighters.\nAs soon as the envoy prepared by the imperial family sent a signal, the knight and I took our posture and charged at each other.\nThe duel between the great warriors, announcing the start of the full-scale war, had just begun.\n[ TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to\nread up to the 5 chapters ahead\nof the release: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007]",

      "content": "37 –Great Duel(2)\n[Physis's POV]\nThe sound of clashing gauntlets and greatswordserupted, and the snowfield was disturbed.\nThe attack of the knight’s sword was heavy. He wasn’t an idle talker, but a man with considerable skills.\nAmong the knights of Rodenov, similar sword strikes were used by those in the upper ranks.\nBut the knight in front of me was not very fast. However, the power that was loaded at once was extraordinary. To the point where I could immediately judge that it would be dangerous if he hit me directly.\nAt the same time, it was systematic, so there were not many gaps. It was common for those who wield a greatsword to be swayed by the weight of it, but this knight was not like that.\nHe skillfully wielded a greatsword that was as tall as he was, and it was difficult to find gaps because he was very comfortable with switching between offense and defense.\nEvery time the greatsword was swung, the snow on the ground soared, and the ground shook every time the knight took a step. The sword attack continued to drive me, and a heavy impact spread through the gauntlet every time it was swung.\nCertainly, the unknown knight I was dealing with was strong. A person who knew his strengths and knew how to minimize his weaknesses.\nIn other words, he was someone who knew how to look at himself objectively.\nBut… …Even if he was like that, it was not enough to give me a sense of crisis. I read the path the knight’s sword was heading, and struck his greatsword first before the full force was applied to it.\n- Caang!\nThe knight’s greatsword ricocheted off, and the knight, who took a step back in great panic, eventually gave me a gap.\nHe must have realized that too, so he swung his greatsword wide sideways to somehow widen the gap, but I lowered my head to avoid his greatsword and quickly stepped forward and burrowed into his arms.\nJudging from the wide-open eyes of the knight watching me, it seemed that he did not expect me to be this fast.\nThe knight tried to get back into his stance, but before that, my powerful mana-covered fist struck him in the stomach.\n- Banggg!\nAn explosion erupted and the knight’s upper body leaned forward, and at that moment I struck his bowed head violently with my fist.\nWith an explosion similar to the one before, the knight fell to the ground.\nIt was a smooth first win.\n* * *\n[Edith's POV]\n'Not good.'\nEdith thought as he watched the first duel between Physis and a naive knight with a greatsword.\n‘Was his name Physis Ortaire? Why did he want to go to the great duel… … There was a good reason.’\nThe naiveknight was a strong man who held a fairly high standard among his comrades. His steely stance and the series of attacks he unleashed with his greatsword were something people could not easily withstand even with mana, and his ability to judge distance was quite excellent too.\nHowever, he was easily defeated.\n‘Sir Lucas Wintes hasn’t even come out yet. maybe… … If it goes on like this, there is a high possibility of defeat. The good thing is that he didn’t even take that naiveknight's life.’\nEdiththought that because it was not uncommon for knights to lose their life in duels between great warriors, so he assumed that this knight would die the moment he was defeated.\nBut Physis did not take his life. For Edith, that was questionable. He couldn’t figure out why that knight'slife wasn’t taken. Is his nature benevolent, or… … Is there something more that Physis is looking for?\n‘Anyway, it’s not easy to see. There was a reason why he won the hunting competition and the jousting match.’\nThinking so, Edith immediately looked around. As expected, he felt that Aiden’s morale had been shattered. Because the knight before couldn’t even hurt Physis and was defeated with an overwhelming power difference.\nIt was necessary to turn the mood around.\n‘But that doesn’t mean I can go out. If I lose my stamina in a duel with Physis Ortaire, I will most likely be defeated overwhelminglyby Sir Lucas… … . There is no way.’\nThe more Edith thought about it, the more he felt that the only thing left for them was defeat. Even if one’s skills were outstanding, that did not mean that they were superior to the knights of winter.\n‘His Excellency asked me to support Aiden… … After all, did he tell us that after looking at the condition of Ortaire and Rodenov? Your Excellency already had this situation in mind. That’s why he told me not to risk my life.’\nIt was only when he sensed defeat, he understood why Crocus had asked him to help Aiden.\n'How strong their power was, how strong their knights were. Keep it in your eyes and tell it to me.' That was what Crocus meant.\nIf one knows a clear reason, one has no choice but to act on it.\nEdith stiffened his face and looked at Physis, who was waiting for his next opponent, and said to his colleagues nearby.\n“You all remember what His Excellency said, right?”\n“Don’t risk your life, surrender when you’re about to lose.”\n“Great. Do not forget that.”\n“Why is that suddenly?”\n\"Perhaps we will lose. There is no victory in sight after Sir Lucas Wintes, even PhysisOrtair, who has defeatedthat naïve knight, will be difficult to defeat. Don't be deluded, and declare defeat immediately if you feel like you’re going to lose.”\n“… …Then, His Excellency... why did he send us all the way here?”\n“It must mean that Ortaire and Rodenov should be evaluated. That’s why I told you not to risk your life. It’s a fact I just realized too. Aiden is hopeless.”\nEdith whispered softly to Eileen, the female knight sitting next to her.\n“Aha.”\n“Be careful, Eileen. Physis Ortaire… … That guy is strange”\n“Is that so?”\n“Yes. Just now, the movements he showed before punching that naive knight didn’t look right.”\n“Tsk, that man is also a monster. I get it. Anyway, I’ll make sure that I'm careful.”\nAfter Eileen said that, she began to arm herself with a nervous expression.\n* * *\n[Physis's POV]\nAfter a brief break, the duel between the great warriors continued. As soon as the greatsword knight fell, the one who came out was a female knight named Eileen.\nShe neatly tidied up her red hair and tucked them inside her helm, then she stared at me holding a halberd bigger than her height.\n“Nice to meet you, Sir Physis Ortaire.” She said to me\n“… …”\nIn a typical warrior duel, it was common to taunt or provoke an opponent, so I kept my mouth shut. I didn't know what words would come out of her mouth, but at least it would be an insignificant provocation.\n“Your skills are amazing, can you look at me for a bit?”\nShe laughed and started talking nonsense. Aiden looked at her in a puzzled way and was screaming at her.\n“What! Don’t jump!”\n“Oh, noisy. Isn’t that funny? If it wasn’t for us, they wouldn’t have been able to conduct a duel like this… … Raising your voice like that. It's just...”\n“But I don’t think swearing at the employer is a very good attitude.”\n“Ah! They are not our employer? There is someone else who hired us.”\n“Who is that?”\n“Aha, you do not think I’m an idiot who will tell you that, right? Well, let’s do this. If you lose to me, I’ll tell you who our employer is. How about it?”\n“It’s not even worth listening to.”\nTo Eileen, who was talking as if she was joking, I said expressionlessly.\n“Is that so? then… … Shall we start slowly? It bothers me that he keeps talking loudly behind me.”\n“… … .”\nAs soon as she finished speaking, I immediately nodded and spurred the ground, appearing in front of her in an instant and wielding a punch.\n“Wow!”\n- Caang!\nSurprisingly, she swung her halberdto parrymy punch, sending it back across his body. It seemed that a momentary decision was made that it was not right to give distance even while talking like this.\n“It’s a surprise… … You were more polite than you looked. Are you not popular with girls? So, you will only end up being hated by your fiancée, is that okay?”\n“… … .”\n“Aha, you are already hated a lot. Well, even if you are like this, a man like you is not acceptable.”\nFor a moment, it seemed that I had heard very intrusive words.\nAs soon as I heard that, I could immediately determine what Eileen was aiming for.\nShe was the type of person who makes her opponent lose their reason by gently scratching the opponent's nerves during combat.\nObviously, she must be intending to provoke me so that I move violently and then drain my stamina. If I get caught in it, I'll only get a headache.\nThe best way to deal with that type of person was to ignore the opponent and hit them until they die and make them shut their mouth.\nAnd that method was also my favorite method.\nI raised the mana and wrapped it across my body. Blue light drifted around the body, and vitality sprang up throughout it. I immediately kicked off the ground and ran towards her.\nThe earth exploded in an instant, and snow scattered in all directions. The scenery around me flashed by in an instant, and before I knew it, Eileen came right in front of me.\nHowever, as if Eileenhad figured it out as well, she immediately took a stance, twisted her body as much as possible, and stabbed the halberd right in front of me.\nWith the sound of the wind ripping, the halberd’s spear point came toward my face.\nThere was no need to evade her attack, who was weaker than me in every way, so instead of evading, I swung my fist at the tip of the spear.\n- Quaang!\nAt the moment of the collision, Eileen’s halberd was shattered as a huge shockwave exploded.\nI didn’t stop there, I grabbed Eileen’s neck, whose face had hardened due to the broken halberd, and lifted her up.\n“Evilness is theroot of all your circumstances. That Aiden had got to fight for his Territory like this and the way you got caught by me like this.”\nI wasn’t too upset by her words, but as always, those who make fun of me or my loved ones with their mouths like that, deserve punishment.\n“Kuu, ugh.”\n“And to those who have spoken the wrong way… … .”\n“eww… … Keck, Keck!”\n“Need to be punished.”\nI grabbed her by the neck and slammed her to the ground.\n[ TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to\nread up to the 5 chapters ahead\nof the release: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007]",

Physis’ winning streak continued without knowing the end.\nNo matter what he heard from her, he beat the female knight with a rather ferocious expression and defeated Aiden’s great warriors one after another even more fiercely than before.\nThe family members around me were enthusiastic about Physis’ winning streak and cheered his name.\nSo did I. It was true that I was anxious about the dream I had recently and the image I had seen of him in the past.\nHowever, this was not a situation and a time to show such anxiety.\nI wasn’t foolish enough to be afraid of him saying that he was scary even in the great duel, where life was on the stack.\n'Yes. Don’t be afraid to ask him directly.'\nI decided to ask him what thoughts he had when he changed his attitude, it was better than struggling alone like this.\nSo now, it was time to cheer him who was risking his life in the duel.\n“You can do it! Physis!”\nI cheered for him with all my might, and even the knights who usually looked down on him began to cheer for his winning streak.\nAnd on given breaks. He returned to the camp of Rodenov.\nPerhaps he couldn’t hear the cheers of the people of Rodenov who were calling Physis’ name over and over again, so he was looking towards Aiden with sharp eyes.\nApparently, Physis was thinking about Aiden’s final battle that was to come next.\nWhen I thought about Aiden’s final battle, I couldn’t help but be nervous.\nBecause it was with Edith Douglas... The winner of the National Day martial arts competition, the same Edith, whom Physis said was strong.\n* * *\n[Omniscient's POV]\n“Can you win?”\nDillard’s expression was half-dead as he spoke to Edith. He asked Edith with a resigned face.\n“It's probably difficult.”\nEdith flatly admitted.\n'Impossible. We couldn’t win!'\nThe more Physis went through the duel, the more he grew.The growth rate made Edithwonder if Physis was really human.\n“Also… …about that-”\n“-No… … He is a monster. Even if I do that, I probably won’t last long. Even if I get lucky and beat him, Sir Lucas Wintes is standing behind him.”\n“… …The Winter Knight.”\n“Yes.”\n“How could you not be?”\n“I have no intention of sitting down and giving up, but the situation is pessimistic. Please prepare your mind in advance.”\n“Hahahahahahahaha.”\nDillard smiled dejectedly. There was no hope.\nEven before the great duel started, he didn’t know it would be like this. How could he have expected the fact that Physis Ortaire will appear as a great warrior-\n'Ortaire’s mad dog.'\n-Because this was in itself a term used to refer to the Physis Ortaire.\nDillard had laughed enthusiastically at the news that such a man had become Rodenov's warrior.\nPhysis Ortaire was a new knight who became a knight by winning the jousting tournament. And jousting was a tournament that does not use mana. He didn’t think Physis was strong because it was a tournament where even a knight who couldn’t handle mana could win.\nCatch a monster in the hunting tournament? And Wiing the jousting tournament? They were obviously great achievements, but the skill of a knight in a duel was not determined by such things.\nA strong body and mana that can crush opponents, as well as sharp skills… … That was the standard for judging a person’s strength.\nRumors were circulating that he wasn’t even training properly, so Dillard wondered if Johannes was crazy.\nBut… …That mad dog performed unbelievably great and defeated four skilled knights in a row.\nThe four knights Edith Douglas brought were obviously unusual even to his own eyes. Enough to keep up with the Rodenov knights cheering for Physis over there.\nBut they collapsed in the snow field without much resistance.\nHe might have some hope for Edith Douglas, but Dillard realized that was futile.\nLet’s say that Edith defeats Physis, and then defeats the other three knights to turn the game around...\nBut Lucas Wintes still remained.\nThe strongest knight in Rodenov, who will soon take the throne of the Swordmaster.\nIt was true that Edith won the National Day martial arts competition and was a knight with superior skills, but even so, he will lose to Lucas.\nWith no chance of victory in sight, Dillard, whose vision began to blur, closed his eyes.\n* * *\n[Physis's POV]\nAfter unarming, In front of me, I saw Edith Douglas standing firm.\nThe great duel had already completely moved over to Rodenov. No matter how hard Edith will try, he will not be able to overturn this fixed game.\nStill, he did not abstain. As if he was aiming for something, he was staring at me intently.\nThe man’s gaze was not pleasant.\nThinking about it, I remembered what a female knight named Eileen had said earlier, who was badly beaten by me for making fun with her mouth.\n‘There’s another person who hired us.’\nAs expected, I felt some doubt when I heard that five talented knights had suddenly come to Aiden to become great warriors…\n'…Something must have been up.'\nPerhaps the person who hired them asked to help Aiden, and also asked them to find out something along the way. He might have been asked to gather information, or he might have been tasked with stealing property from Aiden.\nThere was no way to know at this stage what the plan was, but… … There was nothing wrong with being aware that they were plotting something.\nEdith seemed to have grown more than I had seen in the martial arts competition, and he was radiating considerable momentum. He was probably strong enough to be incomparable to the four knights I had dealt with before.\nHe silently lowered his helmet and took a stance with the longsword slung on his back.\nIn the same way, I lowered my face shield, put on my gauntlets, and took a stance.\nFor a while, we carefully examined each other.\nFinally, the imperial overseer gave the order to announce the start of the duel.\nIn the moment of conflict, the mana-bearing longsword and gauntlet met, and an explosion scattered around.\nWith just that impact, all the eyes around us were surprised, revealing the unsightly appearance of the frozen ground.\nWithout any spirits or provocations towards each other, Edith and I just swung our fists and swords at each other.\nEdith’s longsword passed my ear, and my fist passedhis nose.\nAs soon as the first clash was over, he seemed to have judged that maintaining the distance was favorable, and with a miraculous movement, he escaped the range of my punches and dodged them.\nI also quickly judged the direction of his sword strike, and then pushed myself into the blind spot of his sword skill to avoid it.\nJust as Edith’s attacks did not reach me, my attacks did not reach Edith either.\nUnlike the previous four knights, he didn’t give me space after the first clash, and because of that, I was in a position where I had to use a little more stamina to chase him.\nThe subtle difference was bigger than I thought. Since I had already exhausted my stamina, I couldn’t be free from the overlapping stamina consumption.\nEdith, as if not aware of that, didn’t respond to my punch and continued to choose to evade. He seemed to wait until I was exhausted.\nBut… … I had no intention of playing around with that guy’s will.\nI stopped chasing him, repositioned myself, and watched his every move.\nSo that I could respond to whatever he does.\nPerhaps he realized that I wasn’t playing the way he wanted, so unlike before, when he was just avoiding me, he started pushing me in reverse.\nHe seemed to have decided that there was no point in dragging out any more time.\nIntense yet complex sword strikes began pouring down on me.\nIf a normal knight saw it, his eyes would be dazzled at once and Edith's sword would pierce his heart.\nBy simply looking at the swordsmanship, I could tell at a glance how much Edith had put in to learn this swordsmanship.\nAlso, if one looked at the strong power that resided in each sword attack, it seemed that he did not neglect the basic skills because he was immersed in flashy moves.\nBut… … His swordsmanship didn't give him an edge against me.\nFor my eyes which were unaffected by any dazzle. It was not a very big advantage.\nGradually the world slowed down, and every path his sword strikes took began to engrave in my eyes.\nAnd I started to see the way I should go.\nAt that moment when the direction of the sword was twisted and the tip of the sword withdrew for a moment, I took a step and dug into his arms at the fastest speed I could.\nAs always, the most powerful blow was the simplest one.\nI amplified the mana contained in the gauntlet and put the rotation of my toes and waist on my fist.\nThen, with the biggest blow I could create at the moment, I hit him right into the pit of his stomach.\n- Kwaaang!\nWith a roar that was incomparable to any noise heard today, the surrounding ground was completely shattered and exploded, and his body was slammed into the middle of Aiden’s camp in a terrible shape.\n[ TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to\nread up to the 5 chapters ahead\nof the release: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007]",

      "content": "39 – Previous life\n[Physis's POV]\nThe great duel ended in vain as Rodenov’s first warrior defeated all of Aiden’s warriors.\nDillard Aiden and Alan Aiden and all of Aiden’s family members were staring at the ground with unfocused eyes.\nAll their wealth and glory were destroyed by the ugly words of their successor.\nThe stakeof the great duel was everything that Aiden and Rodenov possessed.\nThe loser had to hand over everythingto the winner. Everything including estates and commercial districts.\nEven the castle they lived in.\n“Thus the loser gives the winner everything they promised. This is the will of His Majesty the Emperor, and Aiden must uphold it.”\nThe moment the sentence fell, Dillard knelt down and sighed.\n“Ahh…”\n‘It's done.’\nSame with Alan Aiden. The malice and meanness he had harbored vanished with the sentencing, and he realized what he had done.\nHe couldn’t even imagine that everything would go like this.\nNow they will be on the streets, and the name Aiden had been downgraded to a commoner.\nWhere to live, what to eat, what to wear? Deprived of all of that, Aiden’s family will all end up begging in the streets in misery.\nSomeone will get sick and die, and a life of noble was no longer possible.\nSince they were now commoners, they could not treat carelessly even the nobles whom they usually looked down on.\nIf they do, their necks would fly off.\nReally, everything was over.\nAiden’s glamorous life, as well as life as an aristocrat, everything was now over.\nAll that was left for them was a pitiful body to live on in dirty streets.\n“… … Because of you. You… … Ruined everything.”\nDillard just said that and fainted.\n“My lord!”\nWith a voice like a scream, Alan hoped that it was all just a dream.\nBut… … Rodenov’s chilly coldness touched his skin and didn’t even allow him to deny the reality.\n“He is not breathing! Please, please anyone call a doctor!”\nGassols screamed and shouted at people, but no one called a doctor for them.\nAlso, everyone who had been supporting Aiden turned their backs and diverted all their attention.\nBefore long, the biting wind finally chilled Dillard’s breath and pronounced Alan’s cruel sentence.\nThis tragedy was just the beginning.\n* * *\n[Physis's POV]\nThere was a festive atmosphere in Rodenov. Both His Excellency Johannes and Duchess Claudia did not hesitate to say that I had worked hard.\nMy older brother, who had come to watch from Ortaire, saw me safely defeating Edith, briefly said that I had done well, and then went back to Ortaire alone, saying that he was busy.\nAccording to the pact with Aiden, Aiden’s everything was given to Rodenov.\nThat meant that everything that Aiden enjoyed, including commercial rights, had become Rodenov’s possession, and even Aiden’s territory in the center had become Rodenov’s.\nHis Excellency Johannes said that he would be busy for the time being due to the procedure and everything, but his expression was overflowing with joy.\nSooner or later, several Rodenov administrators will move into Aiden’s territory.\n“He was great. After all, he was the person who threw me into the snow.”\nThe knights, including Sir Lucas, began to praise me. In particular, in the eyes of most of the Rodenov knights who looked down on me, hostility had disappeared before I knew it, and a feeling of goodwill prevailed.\nAdilun, who came to me among them, said.\n“Thank you for your hard work, Physis.”\n“Adilun.”\n“You were amazing. You must have seemed quite capable now…”\n“I was lucky.”\nHowever, the expression on her face when she told me I was amazing wasn't as bright as it should be.\nIt was the same worried expression I had seen on her before, during the jousting. The golden pupils darkened, and a deep mire could be seen in those eyes. Her fingertips tremble little by little, and she tried to curl them up and act calm.\nThe feeling of fear and anxiety about something. Still, seeing her pretending to be determined as if she didn't want to be found out by me, it wasn't easy to ask her directly.\n'What are you afraid of and anxious about?'\n.\n.\n.\n.\nI drank and talked with Rodenov's people at a small banquet held after settling various situations, and finally returned to the dorm and lay down on the bed.\nBut I was worried.\nAll day long, the expression Adilun had floated before my eyes, and my thoughts without realizing that turned to it.\nIt was the same during the banquet. Her forced smile, her anxious gestures, all of that… … It messed up my vision.\nEven if I tried to find the reason, I couldn’t figure it out at all, so in the end, I would have no choice but to ask her directly, but I couldn’t even ask blindly because she didn’t seem to want it.\nAnd I didn’t want her to hate me.\nWhat I did to her was still holding me down.\n'Ahhhh! What should I do?'\nI kept repeating my thoughts in search of an answer, but eventually, unable to find the answer, I had no choice but to surrender myself to the alcohol and fall asleep.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nI opened my eyes but my vision was blurry.\nA field of cold snow with nothing visible was in front of me. The biting wind swept through my skin accompanied by a raging blizzard.\n'Where is this?'\nI couldn’t figure it out, but somehow I felt I had to move forward.\nIn the middle of the endless snowfield, I moved forward.\nWithout even knowing why I was moving, I walked endlessly.\nI didn't know the time but something started to appear in front of me.\nIts shape was unclear. It looked like a person at first glance, but that was all I could tell. It was all enveloped in a black mist, staring at me.\n[Hiiiii.]\nCaught in a fog, It spoke to me.\n“You are… …Who are you?”\n[Well. You guess.]\n“Where is this? I’m definitely in my dorm… … ah.”\nAt that moment, I realized that this was a dream world.\nIf so, maybe that person…\n'….'\nAs I looked with conviction, it nodded.\n[That’s right. I… …I'm a fragment of your old personality that you’re trying to suppress.]\n“Hahaha. It’s ridiculous.”\nIt was absurd. Why am I dreaming like this?\n[There is no need to be embarrassed. The reason you have this dream is simple.]\n“What?”\n[You want to know. Why is Adilun so anxious?]\n“You… … Do you know?”\n[I know. But you don’t know very well.]\nIn an instant, the surrounding scenery changed. As if a puzzle was being put together one by one, the snowfields were scattered, and the world was fragmented… …It transformed into various sceneries.\nAnd in that sceneries, I… …\nI was looking at Adilun with contempt. The appearance I saw right after my reincarnation began to regenerate because of it.\n[Why is she anxious? The reason is so simple. The violence you show, the contemptuous glances you shoot at her, the hateful words you shoot at her. Because of all that… …She is anxious. Do you think that by pretending to be nice now, her scars will be erased? There is no way.]\n“… …”\n[Are you different from your previous life? Hahaha. No way. You were the same guy in your previous life. I said I am a fragment of your ‘old’ personality. You were the same in your previous life. Haa look. This is what you look like.]\nThe landscape changed in the same way as before and an overly familiar landscape was revealed to my field of vision.\nThe images of people being killed by strange monsters, and the image of the city begin stained with their blood.\nThere, I was approaching a woman who was crushed by the rubble of a collapsed building, screaming for help.\n– Can anyone help! please…\n– Money?\n-… …\n– Or is there something that could be a reward?\n-… …\n– No?\n-Ahhh. Please, please save me!\n– No money, no reward… … If you don’t have it, you must die.\nHaving said that, I turned my back.\n[My previous life was different… … Acted for good, finally saved the world… … . hahaha. It’s funny. Yes. Assuming you saved the world and all. But you turned away from so many people. All things that happened for years before you met that child.]\n[Even after doing that, your appearance shouting that you are pursuing goodness… … Don’t you think that it’s disgusting?]\nI couldn’t say anything. Because what it said was true.\n[Why is Adilun afraid of you… … Why does she feel insecure? The reason is simple. She knows That people don’t change easily, she knows what kind of guy you are. Now, let’s be honest.]\nLike a child, it demanded the truth from me.\n[Can you say that the thought of wishing Adilun happiness wasn’t just to forget the disgusting things you’ve been doing?]\n“No. I'm unmistakably sincere that I wished her happiness.”\n[Lie.]\n“It’s not a lie.”\n[No, it’s a lie! While wishing her happiness, you don’t know what she likes or what makes her happy, none of it… … You didn’t even try to find out. You just matched what she was doing with what you saw in the scraps of a tree.]\nWords like blades pierced my heart.\n[Now, are all the questions answered? Then...]\nIn an instant, all sorts of hatred, anger, and disgust toward me began to appear on its face.\n[Get out of here.]\nAt the same time, my consciousness was thrown into hell.\n[ TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to\nread up to the 5 chapters ahead\nof the release: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nAnd also check out my friend series I Became A Framed Villain ]",

      "content": "40 – Sure (1)\n[Physis's POV]\nI opened my eyes. it was too vivid to be only a dream that I had because I was drunk and felt dirty.\nWhat it said kept repeating over and over in my head.\n[You don’t know what she likes or what makes her happy, none of it… ...You didn’t even try to find out.]\nIt was bitter, but it was true.\nOn the subject of wishing her well, I knew nothing about her. It wasn’t just that; I didn't even tell herabout myself or how I felt. I just skipped over it and matched her words with a good attitude.\nOf course, that alone could have eased Adilun’s heart to some extent. but… …None of the essential problems had been resolved, and she could not help but feel anxious.\nAfter knowing what the problem was, I could see why she had been anxious and reluctant to see me lately.\n'Adilun has yet to gain confidence in me.'\nWhen I thought of the violence I had shown and the insults I had spoken directly to her… … It would be strange to be convinced so easily.\nSuddenly, my eyes widened, and I was lost in thought.\nUnanswered questions kept circling my head, and I lost confidencein myself.\n'Why did I want her to be happy in the first place? Is it simply because of guilt?'\n'If I tell the truth, will Ailun accept it?'\n'Will the uneasiness in her mind disappear just because the promised time has passed?'\nTo the questions that had arisen, I tried to answer myself.\n'Why did I wish her happiness?'\nIt was because she was shining brighter than anyone else in the novel I had read, and she was pursuing the goal I was pursuing.\nI knew that I had lived a life of shame.\nI treated many people harshly, and my past life, which I took for granted, would not be justified.\nEven so… … I tried to change, or at least tried to do good. I had nothing to say if one called it hypocrisy, but at least I was proud of myself. At least, it was better than inaction and crying out for good.\nFrom my point of view, Adilun was the most ideal figure.\nEven though she was ostracized and hated, she stepped forward in every crisis and saved even those who insulted her.\nI hoped that such a person would be happy. Even if it was simply a just a character in a novel, if there was a world where she lived, I hoped that she would be happy.\nBut in reality, she wasn’t happy. My existence made her unhappy, and it made her suffer.\nThe guilt I felt there made me move for her.\nBut… … That guilt began to change little by little.\nWatching her scream that she considers herself miserable because of me, and seeing her rejoice that I care for her, not just because of guilt, but as a human being, I wanted to help her.\nShe was no longer the virtuous and flawless Adilun of the novel I knew, but she was just an ordinary person in need of help and care.\nAs soon as one thought was organized, the next question ran through my head.\n'Even if I tell the truth… … Will Adilun accept that sincerity?'\nAnd in such a state, just because the promised time has passed, will the anxiety that had settled inside her be relieved?\nShe probably won’t accept it right now. Because right now she had no confidence in me.\nEven conversation was difficult, and there was little chance of me expressing my feelings. Because she distrusted me.\n'But if I continue to care for Adilun… … Gradually, she too will become convinced.'\nShe will become certain that I'll there for her.\nYes. There was no need to rush. Because in order to earn people’s trust, the action was alwaysa prerequisite.\nIf I kept quiet about what I had to do… … Adilun will believe in me someday.\nAfter I finished organizing my thoughts, my head became clear, and I was able to have confidence in what actions I should take.\nIt was an unpleasant encounter, but the conversation with my dream fragment definitely made it possible to sort out the many unorganized thoughts I had.\n'If we meet next time, I will have to thank you.'\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\n'Again, that dream.'\nI wiped the tears from my eyes, and before I knew it, I realized that the day was bright again.\n'It can’t go on like this.'\n'I can’t be suspicious of Physis forever. I can't always be afraid that he’ll suddenly change his attitude.'\n'...Then. What should I do?'\nJust yesterday, Physis said today he was going back to Ortaire.\nI wanted to know what he had in mind and what he was thinking of me.\nThat way, the anxiety remaining in my heart would be relieved. Only when I get rid of this anxiety...\n'I Willbe able to focus on my work.'\nSo I had to meet and talk before Physis leaves for Ortaire. At least now he was not ignoring me or something right now…\n'Yes …I'm going to have a conversation.'\nAfter thinking like that, I washed my body thoroughly, and after finishing all the preparations, I headed to the room where Physis was staying.\nHowever, even when I gently knocked on the door, he did not hear my presence.\n'Where did you go?'\nJust in case, I asked the maids nearby, and they said that as soon as Physis woke up, he went straight to the gymnasium. Upon hearing that, I immediately moved to the gymnasium.\n.\n.\n.\nHe was punching lightly in the middle of the gymnasium. However, I didn’t miss the airflow of mana coming out of that light punch.\n-Bang!\nSuddenly, the sound of something exploding in the air was heard, and the area around where his fist struck was distorted.\n'How the hell did he do something like that?'\n'No, this is not important.'\n“Good morning. Adilun.”\n“Yes. Good morning. Did I disturb your training?”\n“Nope. I was just organizing my thoughts.”\n“May I ask what you were thinking?”\n“Just… … No big deal. I have been thinking about what to do next for a while.”\n“Did you find the answer?”\nHe nodded at my question. Looking at his somewhat relieved expression, it seemed that he was not lying about finding the answer.\n“By the way, why did Adilun come to see me?”\n“For a moment… … I want to talk a little bit.”\nAs if Physis noticed something about my words, he asked and then waited for my words with serious eyes.\n“You know, I've been acting weird lately, right?”\n“Yes. I know. And I was worried too. Because I couldn’t figure out why. I really wanted to talk to you about why are you so anxious? Why do you shake when you see me… … I wanted to know.”\nHe also knew all too well about my condition.\nI got straight to the point.\n“Where should I start talking? The beginning… … It was during the jousting when you were savagely ramming Alan Aiden.”\n“You mean the tournament?”\n“Yes.”\n“Why… …?”\nHe was sincerely puzzled. I could understand him. Alan Aiden was the one who insulted me. It was only natural to beat such a person like that.\n“I saw your eyes back then. That’s… … It was the same eyes you had back then when you hated me.”\n“… …”\n“From then on, I started to get anxious. What if your change was just my illusion? What if you were actually thinking about me the way you used to? What if the change you have now is simply an act to change the situation around you?”\n“…”\n“The tail-to-tail questions continued to unnerve me. right now… … Even just yesterday, I had been determined to believe in you, but that resolve began to waver. Because I’ve never heard your thoughts.”\nI continued talking, and he continued to listen to me without saying anything.\n“And from then on, I had a dream.”\n“Dream… …What do you mean?”\nWhen I said that I had a dream, he put on a puzzled expression.\n“Yes. I showed you my favorite landscapes and told you about my favorite things. By the way… …It was a dream in which you laugh bitterly at it.”\n“Then… ....”\n“The anxiety gradually amplified, and everything about you started to become suspicious. But I couldn’t even tell you my doubts directly. because… …I’m afraid you’ll quit acting and treat me like you used to.”\n“Absolutely not.”\n“Even if you say it can’t be, I’m probably still anxious. The anxiety inherent in me did not build up overnight. So, Physis. I want to be sure that you have changed and that you don’t hate me anymore.”\nWhen I hurriedly shook my head, he looked at me and said firmly.\n“… … What can I do?”\n“You said you were leaving today.”\n“Yes.”\n“Please don’t leave. Don’t leave… …Show me how you normally are and what kind of person you are during the time I promised you. Can you please do that?”\n“If you wish, I am willing to.”\nAt his answer, I felt the anxiety that had been nestled within me pushed away a little.\n[ TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to\nread up to the 5 chapters ahead\nof the release: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nAnd also check out my friend series I Became A Framed Villain ]",

There were no problems, nothing special...\nI just trained with the knights at the gymnasium every morning, and as soon as the training was over, I just hung around with Adilun when she was practicing magic or when she was reading in the library.\nShe asked me questions from time to time, and I answered her according to my subjective nature.\nThere were times when Adilun smiled with satisfaction, and there were times when she puffed out her cheeks in displeasure.\nToday when I was sparring and chatting with Sir Lucas, Mina, a maid with light blonde hair who assists Adilun, came up to me.\n“Sir Physis.”\n“What is going on?”\n“My lady is calling for you.”\n“Adilun. Where is she?”\n“She is in the study. I think she wants to talk about something today.”\n“I will go right away.”\n“Alright.”\nShe bowed her head toward me, and followed me, stepping behind me as I headed toward the study.\n“Sir Physis. Are you comfortable living in Rodenov?”\n“Yes, I'm very comfortable here. I like this cold weather.”\n“Yes?”\nMina tilted her head as if she was puzzled by my words.\n“Why, did you think I will not like it?”\n“… …Yes. Since you lived in the warm Ortaire, I wondered if you would prefer that climate.”\n“I like the warm climate too. I like it but… … If you’re breathing the cold wind in cold weather, your lungs will get cold and you’ll feel refreshed. And that cold refreshing feeling is indescribable.”\n“If you tell her that, my lady, she will really like it. Hehe. Do you know that Sir, even though you were hanging out with my lady, you never said anything yourself, and always only answered her words.”\n“Did I?”\n“Yes. If I am to guess… …Perhaps the young lady would like to hear Sir Physis talk about himself. It doesn’t need to be anything grandiose. Just what you like, what kind of weather you like… … Even a small thing like this will please my lady.”\n“Right. I will remember that. Thank you, Mina.”\n“I’m glad I was helpful.”\nAs soon as the words were finished, Mina knocked on the door of the study and said to Adilun.\n“Miss. Sir Physis is here.”\n“Come on in.”\n“Then, Sir. I have something else to do, so I’ll go. May you and miss have a good time.”\nThe fair-haired, extremely respectful lady-in-waiting for her master opened the door for me and bowed her head.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n“Have you finished your training?”\n“Yes. By the way, what did you call me for?”\n“Because of this.”\nAdilun showed me the unsealed letter with a dark face.\n“A Letter? What letter is it?”\n“I heard that the young nobles of the north are having a separate meeting this time. I don’t know why they’re trying to gather… … Seeing as the proper purpose was not written down, it seems that they are planning to hold a social gathering for the first time in a while. This is the invitation.”\n“Social gathering… … Are you planning to go?”\n“I don’t think I want to go. But, Rodenov is the representative of the northern nobility. If the successor doesn’t go, there will be rumors going around behind the scenes. So… … .”\n“Were you thinking of asking me to go with you?”\n“Yes.”\nAdilun nodded meekly.\n“From now on, you will have to live in the north, and if you become the son-in-law of Rodenov, you will have to run into them too.”\n“Then there is no need to worry. I will go with you.”\nAs soon as I gave the confirmation, Adilun’s expression brightened for a moment. But then it got dark again, and I could guess why.\nNorthern nobility. I didn't know what kind of people they were because I hadn't met them in person, but… … First of all, there were many people who kept Adilun in check in the novel.\nBehind her back, they would gossip about her. That was why as soon as she saw the letter, she must have been worried about it.\nJust the fact that she had to face those who were not kind to her must be a burden for her.\nI feel sorry for that, So I said to her involuntarily.\n“Wait, would you like to walk?”\n“Yes? Ah yes. I just wanted to get some fresh air too.”\n“Then let’s go.”\nShe put the letter back on the desk and got up.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n“How is life in Rodenov?”\nThe same question that Mina had just asked came out of her mo. My answer, of course, was bound to be the same as then.\n“Fine. It wasn’t particularly difficult to adapt to, and the people of Rodenov treated me kindly after the great duel.”\n“That’s fortunate. Come to think of it, I’ve heard the knights say that your skills are so great that their skills improve just by sparring with you…”\n“It’s an honor if they think so.”\n“Even Sir Lucas didn’t hold back his praise.”\n“Certainly Sir Lucas seemed to be a good man. Originally, when a person is defeated, there will always be some bitterness left behind in one way or another, but I couldn’t see any such bitterness in him.”\n“Yes. The fact that he was able to reach the level he is now stems from that character. The attitude of not dwelling on defeat, and willing to learn even a little from those who are superior to him… … As a result, Sir Lucas was able to become the most outstanding knight in Rodenov. He is the pride of Rodenov.”\n“Exactly…”\nA cold wind blew in an instant, and Adirun’s hair was disheveled.\n“Oh… …The wind is strong. Come to think of it, aren’t you uncomfortable because of the weather?”\nBecause of the wind, she suddenly asked about the weather. Perhaps, she was thinking the same thing as Mina earlier.\nRemembering Mina I did not hold back either.\n“No. Rather good. After training in the morning, when I’m out in the cold air… … I feel refreshed and my lungs feel so alive because of the cold. Ortaire is a warm area, so it was quite hot even if I trained in the morning, but it was nice because it wasn’t like that in Rodenov.”\n“Aha… …I guess you hate the heat?”\n“Hot or cold, if I had to choose which cold I prefer, I would choose the cold one.”\n“If I ask, yes. Cold is better. Sometimes when my head hurts or when I’m in the cold wind, there are many times when my thoughts are organized. Of course, a blizzard is not pleasant.”\n“But. When there is a snowstorm, all sorts of things happen.”\nBy the time the trivial stories continued, and her mood was relieved to some extent, I asked her about things related to the Northern nobles.\n“Ah, Adilun. I have a question about the social gathering, can I ask it?”\n“Yes. Ask anything.”\n“Where is the social gathering held this time?”\n“The place where the social gathering is held is the Devaton family. It’s a family that has quite a few strong soldiers. It is a family that is always in a position to fight monsters.”\n“Devaton… … Could you tell me about the family that is coming to this social gathering? I think that’s how we’ll be able to respond when we meet.”\n“Well… …Then let’s go to the study first and finish the story there? Because I think the explanation will be quite long.”\n“Yes.”\n“Positive attitude, nice to see.”\nSaying that, Adilun touched the horn on her head with a satisfied expression. Maybe… …That must be a habit of hers; it must be something she does when something satisfying happens.\nIt was so cute that I couldn’t help but laugh.\n“Hahahaha.”\n“Well? What’s wrong?”\n“No, it’s pretty cute how you’re fiddling with the horns.”\n“Ah?”\nShe momentarily lowered her hand. Her face seemed to have turned red.\n“Ah, this. T-that.”\n“It’s okay. You don’t have to answer. I think it’s a habit that can’t be easily changed. But Adilun. I have a question for you.”\n“Yes?”\n“Please don't think I'm making fun or something. And tell me if it's bad but I just wanna ask that... Isn’t that horn heavy? They seems to be somewhat inconvenient.”\n“Ah yes. It’s not that heavy. And it’s not particularly uncomfortable. Well, at least, it wasn’t until that pillows got stuck in horns when I slept, and there were times when my clothes got caught in horns and it was a headache… …But I’m used to it, so it’s okay.”\n“Aha… … . By any chance, if it’s really not rude, can I touch it? After seeing Princess Lobelia touch it in the past, I wanted to touch it at least once.”\nIsn’t that a question people usually have? The psychology of wanting to touch something unique.\n“Uh, um… … that.”\nFor some reason, she seemed quite troubled.\n“Okay sigh, it’s okay sigh. It doesn’t wear out anyway.”\n[ TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to\nread up to the 5 chapters ahead\nof the release: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007]",

      "content": "42 – Cold\n[Physis's POV]\nWith a blushing face, Adilun willinglylet me touch her horn. The large horns growing on her small face wereclearly visible at a glance, shining in blue-white color.\nSeeing her like that, I again asked for permission.\n“Are you really okay with it?”\n“Yes. It’s just a horn anyway, and my senses are weak, so it’s okay.”\n“T-then… …Excuse me.”\nI slowly and gently reached out my hand and touched her blue-white horn. I expected them to feel a little rough, but they were completely different.\nThe smooth texture of the horn was felt through my hand vividly.\nCurious as they didn't feel hard at all, kike a child, I stroked her horns with my hand. Quite addicted to the touch, I involuntarily focused my entire mind on her horns.\nI felt like I finally understood why Princess Lobelia wanted to touch this horn so much.\n“Ahh!… … Is it okay now?.”\nIn an instant, a strange sound came out of Adilun’s mouth, and she grabbed my hand.\n“Well? Why?”\n“Hey, can you leave them for a second now?”\nShe grabbed my hand and pulled me down. Then I was able to see her face. Which was turning red like I had never seen before.\n“Adilun? Are you okay? Where does it hurt? Aren’t you catching a cold?”\nI panicked and checked her condition. Even if she had the dragon’s bloodline, her body wasn’t as strong as the dragon’s yet.\nSo I hurriedly put my hand on her forehead.\nQuite a bit of hot heat ran through my hands, and I could clearly see her flustered.\n“Oh, no. It’s not a cold.”\n“No matter how you look at it, it looks like a cold… … Let’s talk about the social gathering tomorrow. You should get some good rest today.”\n“No! It's not!”\nShe screamed and looked at me again with a sorry look on her face.\n\"...\"\n“Ah P-Physis, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to scream. But I really don’t feel sick or cold.”\n“But your face is too red for that… …”\n“I was just, I was just embarrassed...”\n“But I remember that when Princess Lobelia touched you, you didn’t even move… …”\n“You dummy, No. Because this case is different from the princess.”\n“Is the case different?”\n“Just think about it yourself. Eh, first of all, as you said, I need to go back to my room and get some rest. Let’s talk about the social gathering tomorrow!”\nAfter saying that, she walked towards her room with brisk steps which took me by surprise as well.\n'… …Is she ashamed? Did I make a big mistake again?'\nI started to panic at the thought that she might alienate me again.\n'I need to apologize.'\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\nMy face was hot. I locked the door and grabbed my face.\nI felt something... something strange. He only touched my horn, but at the same time I felt quite ashamed… … My whole body started to heat up.\nObviously, when Princess Lobelia touched them, I didn’t feel anything like this, but why? Even then, the situation was similar. Princess Lobelia, who wanted to touch the horns out of curiosity, similarly fiddled with my horns a little and was amazed, and I didn’t pay much attention to them either.\nBut why… …Why did this sensation spread throughout my body when he touched me?\nI stretched out on the bed, hugging myself and calming myself down. However, my body did not calm down easily.\nThis was because the situation and sensations of the earlier moment continued to disturbme.\nWhen Physis reached out and gently stroked my horn, he caressed them as if he were treating the most precious thing in the world.\nSomehow I was worried that he might break it, but slowly and very gently, he stroked my horn… … Strangely, from then on, shame welled up, and my body started to heat up.\n'I can’t... Let’s cool down a bit.'\nI opened the door to the terrace and started to breathe in the cold air. As the cold wind hit my body, it was only then that my body began to calm down a little.\n“Haaaaaa… …”\nI sighed. I showed an unsightly appearance, even shaking hands and screaming. I should have explained the contents of the social gathering as soon as possible.\nThere was a lot of information he needed to know about the social gathering.\nTo him, who was ignorant of the northern aristocratic society, every little bit of information could be a shield that will distance him from being bitten…\n'Tomorrow, I have to apologize and explained the social gathering in detail.'\n.\n.\n.\n.\nMy body was hot and my head was heavy.\n“Ugh… …”\nA painful moan escaped my mouth, and my stomach became bloated and uncomfortable. A burning pain ran through my body.\nAt that moment, the door opened and Mina entered.\n“Miss. Are you okay…?”\nMina must have noticed that my condition was strange,\nShe immediately ran to me and checked my condition.\nThe cold hand on my forehead made me feel a little more at ease.\n“Oh my God, the fever… … . Wait a minute, lady!”\nMina quickly left my room. It wasn’t long before it got busy outside and my father and the family doctor came into my room.\n“Adilun. Are you okay?”\n“Ahhh… … .”\nThe sinking, cracked voice was not very good even to think about it. The attending physician looked at my condition for a while, then addressed my father.\n“She caught a pretty bad cold.” Then he turned to me and said. “Take a good rest and eat something warm. Please refrain from using magic. It will take a toll on your body.”\n“Yes…”\nA bad cold. It might be because I had been overdoing it recently. After The National Foundation Day, paying attention to the great duel, and practicing magic… …The things about Physis kept messing with my head and kept me awake at night.\n'Social gathering… …I have to explain to him.' I thought this was a bit overkill.\nI drank the hot soup Mina had brought, took the bitter medicine my doctor had prescribed, and fell asleep, on my own accord.\n* * *\n[Physis's POV]\nAfter completing the training, I could feel that the castle had become even more noisier. I wondered what the hell was going on, so I stopped the maid passing by and asked.\n“What?! Adilun has a cold?”\n“Yes. She has been working hard these days… …She must be very tired.”\nAs soon as I heard that, I immediately headed to Adilun's room.\nOutside the door, Mina was standing upright. She looked at me and said.\n“Ah, Sir Physis. What did you come here for?”\n“I heard that Adilun has a bad cold…”\n“Are you planning to visit her?”\n“Yes.”\n“Oh, that's great. I also had to leave for a while because of the lady’s medicine. Sir Physis, I know it’s a rude request, but could you please stay by my lady’s side?”\n“I will gladly do that.”\n“Thank you. Just open the door and go in. My lady is sleeping soundly right now, so please go inside carefully.”\nI nodded and opened the door.\nWhen I opened the door and went in, I saw Adilun, who was soundly asleep. I took a chair next to her and sat still.\nI guessed it was me that made her catch a cold. From the moment her face turned red, I felt something strange.\nAs I was looking at her with an apologetic expression, she suddenly let out a moan and began to suffer.\n“Ahhh… …ugh.”\nJust in case, I put my hand on her forehead, and her forehead was as hot as a ball of fire. I moistened the small cloth beside her with water and placed it on her forehead.\n“Ah, water… …”\nThen she suddenly opened her eyes and started looking for water.\nI checked the water jug next to me and poured the water from the jug into a small cup and made her drink a little.\nHearing a gurgling sound and conforming that Adilun has indeed drunk some water, I felt much more at ease, made her fell back to sleep.\nWhen someone was sick, just being by their side was reassuring.\nEven though she was sleeping, she would be much more relieved if there was someone holding her hand when she was awake in pain for a moment.\nShe might hate that I am by her side.\n'When will Mina come?'\nIt won’t take long for it to be the time to take the medicine.\nWell, something must have happened.\nI didn’t have anything to do anyway, so I decided to stay by Adilun’s side and take care of her.\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\nIt was painful.\nThe severe cold that I had been experiencing for the first time in a long time made me suffer more than I expected. At first, I was able to maintain consciousness, but after a while even that was difficult.\nAfter sleeping and waking up in a hazy state, I suddenly felt a cool hand on my head and a cold towel on my forehead.\nOh, it seemed that someone was taking care of me.\nAs soon as I recognized that fact, the thirst that came from my hot body overtook me.\nI asked for water without even realizing it, and someone who was caring for me poured water into a cup and poured it into my mouth.\nAs I drank the water mindlessly, I felt the pain in my throat go away a little bit. Leaving myself in that small comfort, I fell asleep again.\n'Who is next to… … I guess it’s too late. I should say thank you when I wake up.'\n.\n.\n.\n.\nWhen I opened my eyes, I began to see the dim scenery outside through the window. The pain I felt earlier had already gone, and my body was quite lively.\nThe wet towel on my head was cold as if it had just been removed... It was probably Mina.\n“… …Mina?”\n“Ah, Adilun. You’re awake. Are you feeling better?”\n“Physis… …? Why are you here?”\n“Oh, I’m sorry to hear you say that.”\n“Yes?”\n“I’ve been taking care of you since daytime, but it’s a bit disappointing to hear the name Mina pop up all of a sudden.”\nHe deliberately showed an exaggerated sadness and spoke to me as if playing a joke.\n'No way. the cold hand on my head was of Physis?'\n'Did he keep feeding me the water and changing the wet towel on my head?'\n“ah… …”\n“I'm just kidding. Anyway, I’m glad you’re feeling better, Adilun.”\nThe words that were handed over with a gentle smile made a big ripple in my heart.\n“I-I’m sorry.”\n“Yes? What do you mean?”\n“I shouted at you yesterday… …”\n“Oh, what are you saying? you must not apologize. No matter how you look at it, I think it’s my fault that you caught a cold. The one who should apologize is me. I am truly sorry, Adilun.”\n“Oh, no.”\nRather, the way he gently apologized to me, honestly, I couldn’t help but be moved.\n“Here, have some soup, and lie down a little longer. There are cases where you feel like you are getting better, but you can make things worse by recklessly moving, so take a good rest today.”\n“Yes…”\nI drank the soup he handed me. My body felt more at ease as I felt the warmth circling around my painful body.\nWas it because I ate warm food, or was it because I felt relieved that Physis was by my side? Suddenly, drowsiness began to set in.\n“If you are sleepy, go to sleep. I will always be by your side.”\n“Yes… … . Thanks, Physis… … .”\nI fell asleep and thanked him in my sleep.",

      "content": "43 – Molting\n[Physis's POV]\nAdilun’s cold did not go away easily.\nPerhaps it was because she had been exerting herself too much lately, now she was unable to get out of bed even after regaining consciousness.\nAnd I…\n“Okay, Let's do it.”\n“… …ah.”\nFor the past few days, I had been taking care of Adilun.\nOriginally, it was Mina's job to do so, but I wondered if it was because of me that Adilun suffered so much, so I was taking care of her myself.\nShe started eating the soup I offered her like a baby bird.\n“Is it good?”\n“… …Yes.”\nAfter finishing the soup, she lay down on the bed again.\n“Are you okay now?”\n“Yes. Maybe… … I think I would be normal by tomorrow.”\n“That's good. Well, excuse me for a moment.”\nReaching out my hand and placing it on her forehead, I could definitely feel that the fever had gone down considerably from day one.\nBut Adilun's face turned red again, perhaps because she was a bit ashamed of me touching her forehead.\nThroughout my care, whenever I made physical contact with her, she blushed as if she was ashamed.\n'Are you that shy?'\n“Fortunately, the fever has gone down a lot.”\n“… …Thank you. For continuing to take care of me.”\n“Well, actually, if you look at the cause, I think it was because of me, so I just did what I should to do.”\n“That’s not it…”\n“Yes?”\n“No, nothing.”\n“Anyway, let me know when you get better. I will have to listen to the explanation about the social gathering then.”\n“Well, you can just do it right here. Can I just explain it now?”\n“Nope. Not when you are resting. It is definitely better to rest for now.”\n“Huh, I see... Anyway, if you say that, I’ll just rest.”\nWhen I resolutely refused, Adilun said in a calm voice, perhaps a little sulking.\n“You made a good choice.”\nShe was so cute. I reached out and stroked her hair.\n“Ah. Please don’t do this.”\n“Hahaha. Sorry. But if you don't want that just stop being too cute.”\n“Hmmm. Ah, okay, I’ll rest now.”\n“Yes. Rest well, Adilun.”\nAdilun was face dyed red again and she wiggled back into the futon. It was not good to tease too much either. So I got out of the room.\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\nEver since I was suffering from a bad cold, Physis had been showing me a very friendly attitude.\nWhether it was feeding me soup directly, stroking my hair, or measuring my forehead frequently... It wasn’t that I hated all of those actions. No, it couldn't have been better. It had been a long time since I had received such comfort and friendliness from others.\nThe problem was on my side. Every time he touched me, the heat kept rushing to my face. Even I didn't know why I was being like this, I was still confused.\nEspecially whenever I listened to what he had to say to me.\nHe always said; I’m cute when he sees me with a red face.\n'Where the hell am I cute?! Doesn't he see this monstrous appearance?'\nTo be honest, when I faced him, I couldn’t help myself consider shabby looking.\nJet-black hair, a well-built body with the power to charm the opposite sex, and even a handsome face that nine out of ten women will fall in love with at first sight...\nOn the other hand, what about me?\nIt was true that I had some human features, but all parts of my skin were covered with scales like those of a dragon, giving me a monstrous appearance.\nThe sharp golden eyes numb the hamstrings of those who looked directly at them and make me feel rejected.\nNo matter how much I thought about not hating myself, I couldn’t help it. Because it was right that I was not like a normal person.\nBut Physis told me that I’m cute. I felt good, but… … I honestly couldn’t understand, why?\nWas it simply a lie or was it the truth?\nI couldn’t figure it out. whether it was true or false.\nSometimes I wished I could read his mind.\nBut that would be a futile wish. Even in the magic books handed down from the previous dragons, such magic did not exist.\nIn the end, what I could know was the attitude he showed to me and the attitude he showed to others where I couldn't see.\nTrust was not something that could be easily given away.\nIt was a wish I had already made many times, but I hoped the image he showed me was sincere, not just a lie.\nI hoped so.\nBefore I knew it, the sun was setting outside the window as I was lost in thought. I felt completely better now. There was no problem, it even felt a little refreshing... that was how I felt.\nWas it because I’d been lying in bed for so long? My body itched a little. Well, I couldn’t even wash properly. So it was natural.\nI pulled the thread and called Mina. Fortunately, Mina quickly opened the door and found me, as if she was nearby.\n“Yes, Miss. Did you call?”\n“Mina. I want to take a bath… … Please prepare the bath.”\n“Yes. Miss.”\nIt didn’t take long for her to prepare for the bath. Mina must have predicted that I would wash up soon, so everything was already ready.\nSurely, it was because she supported me for a long time. Perhaps the one who knows me best in Rodenov is Mina.\nCommon princesses take a bath with the help of maids, but I was different. I didn’t want to show my body to anyone else.\nI was afraid they will look strangely at my body covered with blue-white scales. Of course, I didn't think Mina would do that, but I just didn’t like it.\nThe large bathroom adjacent to my room was big enough for me alone.\nIn order not to make the cold worse, I quickly took off everything I was wearing and put myself in the warm bath.\nWhen the warm water touched my body, my mind began to feel more comfortable.\nHow long was I soaking? Something felt itchy.\nI couldn’t stand this itching that started from my fingertips, so I started scratching the skin on my fingertips without realizing it.\n'Why am I doing this?'\nI knew that scratching would hurt would my skin, but I couldn’t stop scratching.\n'How much did I scratch?' Usually, if I scratch that much, there should be a pain, but today there was no pain.\nIt was a strange thing. When I looked at my fingertips, wondering why, I couldn’t help but be surprised.\n“uh… …?”\nThe scales on my fingertips were peeling off. The scales began to peel off along the fingertips, like a snake shedding its skin. What was revealed at the spot where the scales were peeled off was white… … Beautiful white skin.\nWhen I felt embarrassed by the sense of difference in the skin that I did not think was mine, Itching began to spread all over my body.\n“OMG.”\n- itchy itchy itchy\nThe scales naturally began to peel off. Starting from the fingertips, the scales all over the body began to fall off… … Finally.\nEven the scales on the side of my face fell off.\nWithout even having time to feel the slight pain of the scales coming off, I turned my gaze to the bathroom mirror, which I had put away because I didn’t want to look at it.\n“ah,”\nMy vision blurred, and I saw myself reflected in the mirror.\nWhat was reflected in the mirror… …\nWasn’t dragon skin, it was me with white, intact human skin. Although I still had horns.\nThe tears didn’t stop. The first time I saw myself after 19 years… …\nI looked dazzlingly beautiful. Even more so than Princess Lobelia, famous for her beauty.\nSeeing my whole face for the first time, I just sat down and wiped away tears.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n'How long has it been?'\nRealizing that too much time had passed while crying I hurriedly finished the bath and collected the lumps of scales that had fallen from my body... To prove that I am me.\nThis was in case other people didn’t recognize me. Or wouldn’t know even with the horns on top of my head.\n'What will the people of the castle say when they see me? Especially, what would Physis say while looking at me? Will he be delighted, or will he be surprised?'\nI couldn’t have predicted all the reactions, but a smile began to form on my lips. I was just happy.\nIt wasn’t just an appearance, but… … Somehow, I felt like I had regained my whole self.\nI also had doubts. Why did the scales come off all of a sudden?\nThere must have been a reason, which I didn't know.\nIt was said that the family inherited the dragon lineage, but many records about the dragon have been lost.\nIt was just that I had no choice but to live and know.\nThe gait that was a little shriveled became confident little by little. Finally, I opened the bathroom door.\nFortunately, no one was in the room. The clothes were just lying there, neatly arranged. Apparently, Mina had gone to work separately.\nI changed my clothes and looked at myself in the mirror.\nI wondered if what I saw in the bathroom earlier was an illusion. More beautiful than anyone I had ever seen… … I saw myself again.\nWhen I was staring at the mirror endlessly like that. I heard a knock on the door outside…\n“Adilun, are you finished with your bath? I think you will have to eat dinner soon, so I’ve prepared it.”\nIt was Physis.\n“Yes. Come in.”\nIt was a tense moment. As soon as I finished my answer, there was a squeaking sound and the door opened… …He entered the room.\n“How are you feeling now...?”\nHis eyes were wide open as he looked at me.\n“… … Are you?”\nHe was able to complete his words only after one breath. His surprised face came into my view… …His eyes met my golden eyes.\n“Yes.”\nSmiling wider than ever, I answered him happily.\n[ TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to\nread up to the 5 chapters ahead\nof the release: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007]",

      "content": "44 – More than anyone\n[Physis's POV]\nAs soon as I opened the door, I saw the most beautiful woman I had ever seen.\nHorns on top of her head, dark blue hair like the night sky was mesmerizingly wet as if she had just finished taking a bath, and finally… …The bright golden eyes which seemed to tell me that woman in front of me was Adilun.\nAs I asked her directly, a soft but pleasant voice came out of her mouth as usual.\n“Are you...?”\n“Yes.”\n“Adilun. The scales… … . What happened?”\n“I don’t know either. Just… … After taking a bath, my whole body started to itch, and when I scratched, the scales fell off.”\n“What! Are you okay? Is there a place where you feel pain?”\n“Oh, No. I don’t think there is... for now.”\n“Haa. That's fortunate, I was worried...”\nI was worried that if the scales on her body were torn off forcefully by herself, but if that was the case, then she would have a painful expression on her face. But on the country, she looked happy, it seemed that was not the case.\nInstead of admiring her beauty, I felt rather fortunate; She will no longer have to face gossip about her appearance.\nRather, she would probably be the subject of praise for most people now. Also, she will witness the jealousy of countless princesses.\nHowever, it was better to be the subject of envy than to be blamed and suffer for looking like a monster. The world is not the land of fairytales; it's cruel and people often don't see how good one is.\nAll they knew was their own belief. For some people some things were great and those things will be bad for someone.\nIf this was going to help her to be more happy, I was happy for her.\n“Fortunate, is that all?”\nWhen I was lost in thought, I was awakened by a sudden regretful voice I heard.\nAt her question, I shook my head in denial.\n“No. It’s too late to say now.” she said that but her eyes spoke otherwise.\n“You look beautiful, Adliun... More than anyone I’ve ever seen.”\nI spoke the words she wanted to hear the most.\n“… …Is that so? That’s fortunate.”\nAt my words, she madethe happiest expression I had ever seen on her face.\nMy heart sank as I looked at her slightly sharp eyes bending beautifully. It was an outrageouslook- to such an extent that if one were to let go of one's mind, one would immediately become enchanted.\n“What’s wrong?”\n“Oh, nothing.”\nBut wouldn’t Adilun be rather disappointed if I did that? I am the one who, not long ago, spat countless insults at her.\nIf I changed my attitude towards her just because her appearance had changed, and approached her more aggressively, wouldn't such a disgusting behavior hurt her?\n'Probably yes… … So Let's avoid talking about her appearance.'\nOf course, she might have also wanted to validate that her appearance had improved or she looked beautiful. However, that was the reaction that people who had loved her from the beginning should show.\nSo, I, who insulted her because of her appearance was the person who shouldn’t dare to show that kind of reaction.\n“Ah, I forget… … I brought soup. Would you like some?”\nSo I stupidly had no choice but to ask her like that.\nAt my sudden question, she just nodded.\nFor some reason, there was a hint of disappointment on her face.\nPerhaps, it was as if she was trying to let others know that she had taken off her scales…\n…Well now. Since she had just finished taking a bath and had a cold, I thought it would be better to have some food and recover her energy before calling the people to Adilun's room.\n\"Here.\"\n“Ah yes.”\n“But just in case, lie down in bed. If you’re not careful, you might catch a cold again. Especially since you’ve taken a bath, you’d better warm up quickly.”\n“Yes. I know.”\nI grabbed her by the shoulders and led her to the bed. Then I brought the tray carrying the meals in front of her and took out the soup on the silver platter.\nAs I had been doing all day, naturally I put the soup spoon into her mouth.\n“Time to eat.”\n“ah.”\nAdilun also seemed to have gotten used to it, and she quickly bit into the spoon I was holding out.\n“You can get tired of soup if you eat it every time, is it okay?”\n“Because I’m not the type to enjoy eating something in the first place. And above all, this soup is really delicious... And I don't want to look so immature to complain about the soup or food that the chef has put so much effort into.”\n“I’m glad that’s the case. Actually, I was worried that eating the same food for days might not be good for your mood.”\n“It’s really fine.”\n“If there is something wrong with your body, please tell me. To be honest… … I am a little anxious.”\nAs if pondering over my words for a moment, she rested my hand on her chin and lost herself in thought. Perhaps, she was immersed in thoughts of why the scales suddenly fell off.\n“Well… …For now, this is my hypothesis;”\n“Yes?”\n“It is said that snakes are at their weakest when they shed their skin.”\n“Yes.”\n“Maybe… …I guess the reason I caught a cold was for the same reason.”\n“Then does that mean your body will grow more now?”\n“I do not know. I don’t even know that far. People like me weren’t that common, and there weren’t any records.”\n“Anyway, I understand... Ah, Adilun.”\n“Yes?”\nBecause she had finished eating, I could call other people now. Adilun certainly seemed to have recovered much more energy than before.\n“I will bring His Excellency Duke Johannes and Duchess Claudia.”\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\nIn an instant, the door closed and he said he would bring my parents and left.\nEven after he left, I couldn’t believe the current situation, so I pinched my cheek.\nIt felt tingly, and it hurt.\nIt was not a dream. I looked at my hand; Clear skin came into my eyes.\n'ah'\nOnly then did I know, that I wasn’t a monster... But a human.\nThe self-defeating sense of shame began to disappear at once. The wounds that lowered my self-esteem were starting to wash away.\nThe reaction that Physis showed just before was triggering such thoughts even more.\nAfter he said I was beautiful, the reason he didn’t bother to say additional things about my appearance was probably to be considerate of me.\nAs soon as he saw my changed appearance, what he said came to my mind.\n‘Are you okay? Do you have any pain somewhere?’\n‘That's fortunate...’\nHe was more concerned about my well-being, not my appearance.\nAt the same time, I started to think of the insults he had thrown at me at a year ago.\n‘Get out of my sight. I don’t want to see that ugly face of yours again.’\nUgly monster. Yes. The words I heard back then had taken away all my pride and put me down.\nBut now he… … he didn’t forget, he knew what did he say, and how great was the wound I received then. So he must have had no choice but to save words about my appearance.\nBut I also felt a little bit sad and disappointed.\nIt was to the point where I inadvertently wished he’d paid more attention to my appearance. Because I wanted to recover my shattered pride little by little like that.\n'To hear that I'm beautiful and not a bit lacking.'\nAs I was whining like that, a thought suddenly came to my mind.\n'He… … Has he ever told someone that \"you are beautiful.\"?'\nI continued to think deeply.\nThe National Foundation Day...\nPrincess Lobelia and numerous other princesses...\nCome to think of it, he had never once praised another women’s appearance or admired their beauty.\n'But He… … told me I'm beautiful.'\nAt the fact that I suddenly realized this and joy began to fill my heart.\nHe acknowledged his mistakes, cared for me, and acknowledged me.\nBecause of what happened in the last few days, I couldn’t help but feel grateful to him little by little, but to think he had gone this far.\nMy thoughts about him started to go one step further... in a positive direction.\n* * *\n[Physis's POV]\nI moved to the Winter Garden attached to the current Rodenov Castle, because I had heard that the Duke and Duchess had been chatting here for the first time in a while.\n“Physis? What happened?”\nHis Excellency, Duke Johannes, welcomed me. The Duchess next to him was also looking at me with a welcome look.\nRecently, since I started to take care of Adilun with utmost sincerity, I could feel that the positive impression they had for me increased rapidly.\n“Can Your Excellency go to Adilun’s room for a moment? The Duchess must go with you.”\n“Well? Has something happened to Adilun?”\n“… …Yes. However, it is not a bad thing.”\n“What is going on?”\n“The scales on her body… …They fell off.”\n“What? Is that true?”\n“Really?\nThe two opened their eyes wide and looked at me.\n“Yes. Please go fast. Adilun is also waiting for you two.”\n“Yes, we will go right now. My lady, let’s go.”\n“Yes. go fast.”\nSo, we quickly headed to Adilun’s room.\nAt the things that would happen afterward, I started to laugh thinking about them.\n[ TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to\nread up to the 5 chapters ahead\nof the release: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007]",

      "content": "45 – Getting drunk\n[Physis's POV]\nReactions that were completely in line with my expectations erupted inside the duchy.\nFirst of all, in the case of His Excellency Johannes and Duchess Claudia, they looked at the scale less Adilun and made a puzzled expression.\nWhile holding Adilun by the shoulder, His Excellency Johannes also said that it was really fortunate that it went well and she was not in pain anymore.\nIn particular, His Excellency Johannes was quite pleased because Adilun looked so much like Duchess Claudia in her youth.\nThe reactions of the servants and maids of the duchy were not much different either.\nThe knights began to tear up as they watched Adilun without her scales.\nIn the end, everyone in the Duchy was happy that Adilun had escaped from being called a monster, and Sir Johannes gave additional compensation to those who had assisted Adilun and held a dinner party for the Duchy.\nThe servants of the castle rejoiced while eating rare and high-quality food, and Adilun also laughed with them.\n“It is a nice day. Isn’t it?”\n“I know, right.”\nThere were also many funny scenes. The knights drank and made all kinds of bets, but there were also scenes where servants and maids looked happy while chatting and eating.\nIn the end, it wasn’t long before a mess broke out, but the Duke, who was already in a high mood, rather encouraged the mess by placing money on their bets as if it was okay. Adilun was no different. She was not helping out in the mess and drinking wine nonstop.\nI tried to stop her as much as possible and told His Excellency Johannes, but His Excellency Johannes also gave permission to drink on a day like today, and because of that, Adilun ended up getting drunk.\nEven she, who had never drunk alcohol, must have been happy about today’s work to the extent that she even enjoyed drinking.\n“Adilun. Are you okay?”\n“Ah, um. Swimming. Yes. Swimming is okay, it’s okay.”\nSeeing her gibberish and her staggering smirk at her faltering steps, it seemed that she was already drunk.\n“This... You’re really drunk.”\n“Nah, I’m not drunk! See. I can walk well!”\nIt was too unstable to walk for her. Eventually, she hit the side of her head with a thud in the hallway of the palace.\n“Ouch!”\nApparently, she hit her horn, but the horn was not damaged. They looked pretty solid.\n“Haa..”\nI let out a deep sigh and tried to hold her hand, which was holding her head against the wall.\n“No!”\n“Yes? Let go!”\n“Nooooo...”\nShe suddenly started rejecting my hand. On the contrary, she suddenly grabbed my hand, which was reaching out to her own, and bit it.\n“Ouch! Why are you like this!”\n“Hehe. I hate it.”\n“Yes? What do you mean?”\n“You look so pretty!”\n'What kind of nonsense is this again?' I thought to myself.\n“What are you talking about again? You look more pretty.”\n“I used to look like a monster, but you look prettier than me, to the point of hating me! Especially dancing! When you dance with Princess Lobelia!” Adilun said.\nShe says she always hated her monstrous appearance, and her self-esteem fell to the bottom, especially because I insulted her externally.\nThis was something I’d heard before, so I just hung my head in disdain to see her.\nShe goes on to say, the way I danced with Princess Lobelia suited me so well, she said she hated that too. The fact that the reactions around us were different from when she danced with me also seemed to ignore her efforts.\nI thought I was just about to be killed.\n“I’m sorry.”\nWhen I said I was sorry, she shook her head in amazement and smiled bashfully.\n“Yes. That was before and it’s fine now. I’m prettier now hehe.”\n“Is that so?”\n“Yes. So from now on, be good! Because there is still some time left… …”\n“I will keep that in mind. Adilun.”\nThe timeshe spoke of must be a promise she made with me.\nAbout 8 months were left now.\nAnyway, I grabbed Adilun’s hand again. This time she also took my hand obediently, but there was a problem.\n“What?”\nHer leg was loose. So I quickly took her body into my arms.\n“Adilun!”\n“Eh.”\n“Is it okay?”\n“Hehe. Yes. it’s okay.”\nPerhaps she didn’t even know that she had almost fallen, she smiled at me as she suddenly hugged me.\n“Physis.”\n“Yes?”\n“I have no strength in my legs.”\n“I see.”\n“Hug me.”\n“Yeah?”\n“Just hug me like a princess from a story!”\n“Oh… …”\nIt seemed that she could not even predict what kind of flow the alternative actions would lead to.\n“Hug me!”\n“Okay, okay.”\nSupporting her back and the inside of her knees, I lifted her up like a so-called princess. It seemed to me that this was much more comfortable than supporting her for nothing.\n“Wow!”\nShe put her arm around my neck and smiled brightly and as if she wasn’t used to the momentary sensation of her body floating.\nIn an instant, my heart beat loudly.\n“Let's go to the bedroom now!”\nBecause of that, I couldn’t help but raise my voice in bewilderment.\n“No. I want to see the garden!”\n“Then you could catch a cold again.”\n“I will not!”\nShe seemed unwilling to give up her stubbornness at all.\nHowever, if we went out to the place where the snow wind blew like this, it was certain that the cold would come back, so I put her down for a while and wrapped her in my coat.\nAnd when I picked her up again, Adilun showed a satisfied expression. I resigned myself and decided to do as she wished.\nIt was the first time I had ever seen her behave like this anyway, so I thought it would be better to just accept it.\nBut, considering all the mental pain she must have suffered, it might have been the first time she had been able to relax like this.\n“Where shall we go like this?”\n“Hey, let's go to the Winter Garden. Yey!”\nWith her in my arms, I went out into the winter garden: a garden that Duchess Claudia took care of with great attention, and it was a place where Adilun visited whenever her feelings were complicated.\nEven in winter, colorful flowers were blooming in that place.\nI had often seen her stop by the Winter Garden while living in Rodenov.\n'Anyway, why did she suddenly want to come here?' Thinking that I asked her.\n“The winter garden… …Why did you ask to come here?”\n“It’s just because the winter garden view at night is pretty… … . And I have something I want to say to you.”\nShe mumbled.\n“To me?”\n“Yesssss.”\n“What do you want to say?”\n“Earlier… …When I asked how about my face… … . You didn’t answer properly.”\n'I should have answered correctly then. That you are more beautiful than anyone else.'\nHowever, that alone didn't seem to be enough for her.\n“I answered clearly.”\n“You didn’t!”\nShe spoke to me in a voice full of anguish.\n“You didn’t… … . I, I always imagined that. My scales will come off one day… … If I become prettier than Princess Lobelia, to the point where your eyes will widen, then I’ll show off to you… … Imagine that. Then you can’t get your head around my face anymore. You, who just called me a disgusting monster.”\nYes. Imaginations and desires. The two things which all humans have.\nShe was also a normal human girl.\nSometimes she was sad, sometimes she was happy, and sometimes she fantasized about strutting on someone who had been mean to her.\nHow harsh and painful were the words I said to such a person would have been. Moreover, to her at the time, that was my sincerity, so it must have hurt her even more.\nBut now… …Yes. now.\nMaybe my sincerity could heal her wounds a little.\n“You are beautiful. Not empty words… … You are much more than Princess Lobelia.”\n“Really?”\n“Yes. I’m not lying. I have even danced with Princess Lobelia before, right? So I can tell that you are much more beautiful.”\n“You... hmmm. Y-you’re not going to tell me that I’m an ugly monster anymore, are you?”\n“Never. It won’t happen. You are more beautiful than anyone else.”\n“Really? Can I trust you?”\n“Yes. There will be no ifs. Haven’t you always said that lately?”\n“Hehe. Thank you. Please get me off now.”\nShe smiled lightly and asked me to put her down.\nWith both feet on the ground, she took off her shoes and stepped into the middle of the winter garden. The garden was made up of very well-kept grass, so walking barefoot wouldn’t hurt. She wandered freely in the garden, and beckoned to me.\n“Physis, take off your shoes and come here!”\n“Alright.”\nWhy did she look extra pretty when she was behaving this way?\nI also followed her instructions, took off my shoes, and even my socks, and went barefoot to the middle of the garden.\nIn front of me, she abruptly stretched out her hand.\n“Dance with me. Just like you danced with Princess Lobelia on National Foundation Day. No… … More nicer than that. Didn’t I just say I had a funny imagination? This is an extension of that; I wanted to dance a more beautiful dance than the one you danced with Princess Lobelia back then.”\nUnder the soft moonlight, dark blue hair resembling the night sky shines.\nThe bluish-white horn boasts an elegant figure with just that, and now it had completely shed and regained its original shape…\n…She, who was more beautiful than anyone else, invited me to dance.\n'How can I refuse...'\nI held her hand as if possessed.\nBare feet gently we walked through the garden. Music? We didn’t need those things. Just the sound of the wind blowing under the moonlight was enough. Cold or something... it didn’t matter now.\nOur eyes met as we held hands.\nThe sharp eyes gently bent and smiled lightly, making me an idiot in an instant. How could an impression that looked so sharp change so mildly?\nAnd that was not all. Why did she look so pretty when I see herself in those drunken, slightly hazy eyes?\nSomething thrilling began to flow from the place where we held hands. It was a feeling I had never felt before in my life.\n'What should I call this?'\n'Hallucinations.'\n'Yes. I could call it hallucinations.'\nA silent dance without music unfolds in the winter garden. Bare feet intertwined, and each other’s breath intertwined.\nBecause she was drunk, she sometimes stepped on my foot, it was as light as if a feather had stepped on it. Her playful smile, whenever she stepped on my foot, was so mesmerizing that I couldn’t take my eyes off her.\nMy heart beats, and under the moonlight I finally realized.\nThat... I was in love with this girl.\nThe reason I wanted her to be happy, the reason I wanted her to smile… … All of which could be explained by my crush on her.\nWhat filled me up was that I wanted to make her mine… …A somewhat selfish desire.\nI realized;\nNow that this feeling was irreversible. The fact that this desire will grow bigger and bigger.\nAnd if I let this selfish desire go in the wrong direction… …I could make her unhappy...\nI smiled at her, hiding that storm of emotion inside me in the calm but cool wind of the garden.\n[ TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to\nread up to the 5 chapters ahead\nof the release: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007]",

'\nWrapping Adilunin my coat and caring her like a princess in my arms, I put my shoes back on, left the garden, and headed straight to her room.\nPerhaps because the banquet was over, the inside of the castle was quiet.\n“Um…”\nAdilun's face was illuminated in the dark by the moonlight coming through the small windows of the castle, and she looked out of this world while sleeping peacefully.\nThat was how I arrived in front of Adilun’s room.\nI opened the door, made her sleep comfortably on the bed, and covered her with a blanket.\nWhile taking care of her sleeping figure, I sat down on the chair nearby and looked around for a while, then I stroked her hairhesitantly and immediately left the room.\nMy thoughts were complicatedly mixed. What should I do in the future, how should I treat her… … thoughts like that ran through my mind.\nHowever, all those thoughts eventually boiled down to a single thing;\nTo make Adilun happier.\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\nMy head was heavy and spinning.\n“Ahhh… …”\nI let out an uncontrolled moan and clutched my head. The bright morning sun was beating down on me.\nMy eyes, which had opened, closed again with the intrusion of sunlight, and at the same time, my eyes blinked to open on their own and finally came into focus.\nThe appearance of the bedroom came to my glance, albeit in a blur.\n'Why am I in the bedroom? Yesterday, I must have been eating something at the banquet celebrating my shedding… …?'\nPlaying with my hair, I recalled the memories of yesterday.\n'What happened?'\nReflecting on my thoughts, I recalled the scenes of yesterday one by one. The banquet, the drinks I drank in a good mood, and after that, like a hazy fog, there were gaps in my memory here and there.\nBut… … The more I recalled the memory, the more my face turned red.\n‘I hate it.’\n‘Hug me!’\n‘Eh?’\n‘Dance with me.’\nAs the memories passed one by one, I had no choice but to pull the blanket over my head and scream.\n“Aaaaaaa… …”\nWhat the hell did I do? No matter how drunk I was, my obsession with Physis started hitting my head in an instant.\nThe heat rushed to my face from embarrassment, and even that wasn’t enough, so I had no choice but to kick the blanket.\n'You idiot. Why the hell did you show him that?' I said to myself.\nI wanted to erase the memory of that time, but the memory came back to me even more vividly, from what I said at that time, to what Physis said, to what he did, everything began to come back vividly.\nThe scent I smelled when he held me still seemed to linger in my nose. From hugging his neck, smiling, and dancing barefoot in the garden.\n“Ahh… …”\nI didn’t know if the shame would go away, but the opposite joy also started to fill up inside me.\nEven though I complained about the things he said in the past, he apologized to me for his mistake at that time again and even gave me an assurance that it would never happen. He was always kind to me and cared for me when I was drunk.\nHow captivating was his soft smile when he danced with me? In an instant, my heart was beating fast.\nIt was so funny that I couldn’t help but burst into laughter.\nMaybe that’s why I fell for him first even before 8 months had passed.\n'But the day he keeps his promise, then I will tell him.'\nWould it be long or short…? … Somehow, I started waiting for that time.\n'How will my relationship with him change at that time?'\nJust as I was about to get out of my thoughts, I heard a knock on the door.\n“Miss. This is Mina. May I come in?”\n“Yes, come in.”\nMina opened the door and brought honey water along with a simple breakfast.\n“Honey water?”\n“Yes. SirPhysis said that the lady is going to suffer from a hangover, so it would be better for her to drink some honey water.”\n“Aha… …”\n“Did you have a good time yesterday?”\n“Yes?”\n“Some people say they saw Sir Physis taking away a drunken lady yesterday in his arm. Couldn’t it be that you did something stupid?”\n“Oh, no. I just danced.”\n“Aha. Anyway, rest a little longer, and call me if there is anything you need.”\n“Yes. Thanks, Mina. By the way, if you meet Physis, would you ask him to come to my room?”\n“Alright. Oh, then… … Let’s start with simple makeup. I will call the maids.”\n“Yes?”\nAs soon as Mina finished her words, she called several maids to dress me up.\nIn the meantime, I had been feeling reluctance to dress up because of my scales, but whenever I saw my face with the scales peeling off, I naturally wanted to dress up, so I did not refuse Mina’s proposal.\nOf course, it took quite a while to dress up, but… … The results that came out were unbelievable.\n“Uh, um. I am not like me.”\n“You are so beautiful.”\nThe maids began to exclaim at my foolish laugh, saying that the dress was so well done.\n“If that is the case, won’t Sir Physis fall for you at once?”\n“It wasn’t designed for that purpose.”\n“Whoops. How do you feel when you see a changed version of yourself?”\n“I do like it. Really.”\n“That’s fortunate. Miss, you have to get used to it by now. There is a social gathering soon.”\n“Yes.”\n“Then, we will go away. About Sir Physis, I will tell him, I hope you have a good time.”\n“Thanks.”\n* * *\n[Physis's POV]\nWhen I was resting after sparring with the knights as usual, I saw a maid with light blonde hair approaching me.\nIt was Mina.\n“Mina? What happened?”\n“My lady is looking for you.”\n“Okay, I will go.”\n“Ah, sir.”\n“Yes?”\n“Don’t be too surprised.”\nI couldn’t understand Mina’s sudden words, so I asked.\n“What do you mean not to be surprised?”\n“You will know when you see.”\n“Well… …Is that so?”\nBy the way, it was a call from Adilun. Was she okay with a hangover? It must be quite difficult since she was not in the habit of drinking often, but wouldn’t it be better to take a break… … Thinking of such things, I stood in front of Adilun’s room and knocked on the door.\nI knocked on the door.\n“Adilun, may I come in?”\n“Come on in.”\nWhen I opened the door, I saw Adilun wearing a beautiful dress. She even had on light makeup, but it was done in such a way that Adilun's natural charm was very well preserved.\n“Wow.”\nI unknowingly spit out admiration.\n'Is this reaction Mina had been expecting?'\n“How is that?”\n“It really suits you.”\n“That's it?”\nAs I sincerely admired her, Adilun turned the side of her head around and asked calmly. I guess it was to hide the shame.\n“Hahaha, originally I have poor expressiveness. Seeing as I never had a history of admiring someone else’s in the first place.”\nI guess those words were the decisive blow. Adilun’s face began to turn red. Even when there were bluish-white scales, there were frequent scenes of them being stained red, but when the scales came off, the redness of the face could be seen in real-time.\n“Well, if you suddenly say that… … Thanks anyway.”\n“By the way what did you call me for?”\n“That… … I would like to apologize for yesterday’s rudeness. And I think we should talk about the social gathering.”\n“Are you embarrassed?”\n“Yes, that… … I just bit off my hand.”\n“Oh, you mean that? Fine. It could be if you’re drunk. Rather, It was quite good... Seeing all of Adilun’s cute side.”\n“Ahhh… …”\nAdilun lowered her head and blushed. Seeing as I remembered what she did yesterday, she must have kicked off the duvet quite a bit as soon as she woke up.\n“Anyway, I’m really sorry. It’s my first time drinking… …”\n“I was rather good, rather good. I’ve never seen you smile so brightly.”\n“uh… … Did I?”\n“Yes. You put your arm around my neck and smile very brightly… … .”\n“Ah! Stop! Stop talking!”\nAdilun, whose face had turned completely red and was about to explode, waved her hand and began to struggle to cover my mouth.\nLater, I could play more with this topic.\nI laughed and teased Adilun ever since, and I stopped teasing her only because of her pleas to stop.\n“Well, anyway, now I’ll explain about the social gathering. Didn’t I say that the social gathering would be held at the Daevarton family last time?”\n“Yes. I remember.”\n“Anyway, regarding this social gathering, there will be a lot of people who hate me. Apparently, there are some people who are jealous of my position. Perhaps because of that, there are some people who have been spreading all sorts of bad rumors about me behind my back… … Physis? What’s wrong with your expression all of a sudden?”\nIt was a story I already knew, but hearing it directly from her mouth really left a disgusting face.\nI opened my eyes and asked her.\n“… … Who is that?”\n“Uh, um. At that time, I punished him, so there is no need for you to come forward. Moreover, my scales fell off this time too, right?”\n“Yes.”\n“Then I want to make it more efficient to break their tantrums. In fact, that is the reason why I am attending this social gathering. To find my allies, and to stamp out those who show hostility to me. So… … Physis. I have a favor to ask.”\n“What is your request?”\n“Would you like to do some acting with me?”\nAdilun, along with those words, painted a mischievous smile on her lips like a child.\n[ TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to\nread up to the 5 chapters ahead\nof the release: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007]",

      "content": "47 – Social gathering (2)\n[Physis's POV]\n“Acting?”\n“Yes.”\n“What are you talking about?”\n“It’s simple. You and I will be pretending to have a big fight.”\nOnly then I understood her intentions.\nIf we act cold in social gatherings, pretending to fight among ourselves, those who want to use me to harm Adilunwill surely come to me, so shouldn't I remember those names?\n“I understand. If I act like you and I had a fight, those who want toharm you will approach me, and at that time I should make a list of those … … Is that correct?”\n“Exactly.”\n“Then we will have to make a justification for fighting, do you have anything in mind?”\n“Umm… …”\nAdilun seemed to struggle for a moment, then clapped once as if she had remembered something and spoke to me.\n“I think you and I should act like we used to.”\nLike we used to... this was probably about how we looked before I became aware of my previous life.\nThe way I behaved when I spat out all sorts of insults and harsh words at her.\n“What? No, wait. Adilun. that’s kinda…”\nWhen I vehemently rejected her proposal, Adilun gave me a puzzled expression.\nSeeing her like that I continued.\n“Didn’t I promise just yesterday? I will never say anything harsh to you again.”\n“Aaaa… … . I-I’m fine, so it’s fine. You can do it.”\nShe said to me even as her face turned red as if she had again remembered what happened yesterday.\n“But still… …”\nWhen I spoke to her with a reluctant expression, she waved her hand, saying it was okay.\n“Hey, okay, shall we do some practice beforehand?”\n“Right now?”\n“Yes.”\n“No, I’ll be the only one in trouble if someone comes in, so I’ll have to decline.”\nWhat I said was true, the moment someone bursts in and saw me lashing out at Adilun, Rodenov will flip again.\n“Well… … I know that too. Oh. I will tell you about the people to be careful of.”\n“Yes.”\nI straightened my posture again and began to listen to Adilun.\n“First of all, William Devarton, who is hosting this social gathering. He has a strong self-judgment and strong arrogance. His skills are quite good, but… … More precisely, he has the skill of one decent knight. There is a high possibility that he will feel jealous of you because you have gained great fame through the great duel and National Foundation Day this time.”\n“If I pretend to fight you, he will approach you.”\nAt my question, Adilun nodded.\n“Yes… … There is a high possibility that he will approach me after seeing your changed appearance. Originally, he was one of the candidates for my fiancée, so he might approach me while emphasizing that fact.”\n'What fact.'\n“I really don’t like that.”\n“Oh, it’s just a possibility, a possibility. Let go of that face. I have no intention of being friends with such a guy.”\nShe said to me with a surprised expression as I clenched my teeth.\n“If you look closely, I was one of those goons… …”\n“At least you didn’t have a history with women. It was just that you were very violent. But this time, can you act like a fool? That way we can sort it out for sure.”\n“Ha. Okay. And who is next?”\n“Next… … Selina Idenea. She is the daughter of Count Idenea. She’s pretty good-looking, has a strong vanity, and believes she should always be the best. She is also a person who likes to make a fool out of a group of people.”\n“Then… …That woman must hate you.”\n“Yes. Quite a bit. If we get caught, she will probably try her best to bite me.”\nAdilun was a princess of Rodenov, but also a person who was good at magic, so if the aspect of appearance was excluded, there would be no way for Selina to defeat Adilun.\nEspecially this time, as Adilun didn't have her scales, Selinawon’t be able to win against her even with her looks, so the jealousy will explode more.\n“But Adilun.”\n“Yes?”\n“People who are on your side or people who are not... Isn’t it enough to know that?”\n“No.”\nAdilun shook her head.\n“Those who have already been revealed are not important. Besides them, there must be quite a few people who are against me. At this social gathering, I intend to sort them all out. So… …Please.”\n“Okay, Adilun. If you say so.”\n“And… … You are the one who has not to fall for other princesses. I have no intention of allowing someone who is called my fiancé to approach another woman.”\n“Hahahahaha. Okay. That will never happen.”\n“For now, let’s put this aside. And about the social gathering… ….As soon as the date is clear, I will tell you.”\n“Yes. Then what are you planning to do now?”\n“Well… … I do not know. Do you want to watch magic training?”\n“Magic training? That sounds good.”\n“Then let's go. Recently, I had to neglect my magic training due to various things… … But Good for you...”\n“Hey?”\n“Hmmm”\n“I just wanna know one more thing?”\n“What?”\n“How can I hug you again this time?”\nI said spitefully to her.\n“Ah! Enough!! Stop teasing me!!!”\nHer face turned red, and she screamed at me.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n“This is my magic workshop.”\nAdilun's magic workshop was connected to her study, but it was a fairly large space. It seemed to be a magically constructed space.\nIn the magic workshop, the smell of paper was thicker than what I felt in the study, and the paper was stained and speckled with ink that hadn’t dried yet.\nSeeing as the crumpled papers stood out at times, it seemed that it was also a space where she went through many trials and errors.\n“Here…”\nAlso, there were remains of what seemed to be traces of magic all over the place. It seemed that the series of processes of constructing a theory about magic and actually using it were all done here.\nNo wonder. There was no trace of magic in the training ground at all.\nIf there was a space like this, She wouldn’t even need it.\n“Nice.”\n“Yes? Is this nice? Isn't this messy?”\nAs she said, the workshop was actually quite messy; Books and stacks of paper scattered here and there, with spots scorched or frozen by magic.\nIt was a space that could not be said to be clean even with sugar coating, but rather, it felt like a space that was faithful to its purpose.\n“Isn’t it a space that is faithful to its purpose? I would say that this is cool to see how much Adilun is interested in magic and how much effort she puts in.”\n“Oh, well. Thanks... I guess?”\n“It’s a compliment, so there’s no need to make such an ambiguous expression.”\n“I see. Anyway, is there anything you want to see?”\n“I do not know. I’m not that knowledgeable about magic. I just want to see how you practice your magic, is that okay?”\nIn my previous life, there was no study of magic itself, so I had no choice but to be unfamiliar with magic. In the first place, even in this life, the family I belonged to was a knight family thoroughly, so it was not easy to come into contact with wizards.\n“There is nothing that cannot be done. It doesn’t matter if someone sees it in the first place.”\n“Uh. does that happen? I don’t think the other wizards were like that.”\n“They and I have different bloodlines. Perhaps there are significant differences in the way they and I use magic? For example, I don’t take orders. I don’t even need tools to use magic.”\n“Why is that?”\n“My body itself is no different from a magic tool. Usually, the efficacy of tools for using magic is to make it easier to collect mana and to handle mana… …They are like instincts to me.”\nTo my question, she replied with a shrug.\n“Aha… …”\n“Well, it’s because I’m of dragon blood. That’s why I said earlier that it doesn’t matter. My magic is difficult even for a wizard to understand.”\n“You are amazing.”\n“Well… … Well, You have been through a lot, so shouldn’t I have this level of ability?”\nCertainly, considering the insults and things she must have received… …That didn't look like a very good reward to me.\nMoreover, Adilun was a princess of Rodenov. Even if she didn’t know magic, she could have lived comfortably for the rest of her life.\n“Then I’m going to practice magic… … Are you okay? You wouldn’t be having fun.”\n“Fine. I haven’t experienced magic often, so I think it will be amazing and fun to watch.”\n“If so… … . Then don’t talk to me because I need to concentrate from now on. There was a magic I was thinking about recently.”\n“Alright.”\nShe held a thick book in her hand and stepped into a slightly wider area, there were no magic materials in her hand. After that, she opened the book and began to concentrate.\nInstantly, a strong wind blew through the room, and a small mass of light began to form in front of her. As if considerable power had been condensed into a huge mass, the space around it began to distort.\nSoon, her bluish-white horns gradually glowed brightly and began to pour mana into a ball of light. The word that her body itself was a magic tool seemed to come from those horns.\nThe raging wind stopped, and the shape of the light mass seemed to stabilize little by little.\nBut...\n“Oh!”\nAccompanied by Adilun’s bewildered cry, the mass of light trembled unsteadily, and finally...\n-BAANG!\nIt made a noise and exploded.\n'This is not good.'\nI caught her momentarily as she was about to fall backward.\n“Are you okay?”\n“Oh, thank you. This is... It’s a new magic I’ve been thinking about lately… …But It doesn’t work very well. Hehehe.”\n“What magic? It felt like a very powerful force.”\n“That is the star of hope. I put my wish into magic. So that it can become magic that can change in any way. For example, if I want to annihilate my enemies, I give them a powerful shock, and if I want to heal someone, I heal… … It is magic that is close to all-powerful.”\n“Is that even possible?”\n'It can hold hope. Isn’t it almost God’s realm?' I thought.\n“I do not know. I was convinced that it was theoretically possible, but as expected, it is quite difficult to directly ‘put one’s wishes’ into magic. No matter how strongly I wish, if I have a moment’s idle thoughts, It will immediately fail.”\n“That’s great, Adilun.”\n“I didn’t even succeed, so I feel a little embarrassed.”\n“But that’s almost the realm of the gods, isn’t it?”\n“God… … Actually, it’s not even that grand. It’s just a manifestation of a wide range of magic. Instead, it would be that I determine that attribute.”\n“That alone is great.”\n“Well, I feel better hearing from you. I have to say I feel a little bit recognized. Anyway, I think I need to think a little more, but if you get bored waiting, you can go first.”\nShe smiled lightly as she said that, and I shook my head.\n“I don’t have anything to do anyway, and since I’ve finished my training earlier, so it’s okay. It’s even more interesting than I thought.”\n“Well. Then I get it. You are good to stay.”\n“Alright.”\nAfter she got out of my arms, she went to the desk attached to the workshop and began playing with the pen nonstop, holding her head.\n[ TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to\nread up to the 5 chapters ahead\nof the release: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007]",

      "content": "48 – Social gathering (3)\n[Physis's POV]\n“… …That's not... Where did I go wrong?”\nAdilun continued to mutter and play with the pen. A crackling sound echoed through the workshop, and I just watched her in awe.\nHer hair, tied up in a ponytail, wavy, and the fine hairs on the nape of her neck looked very attractive.\nTo the extent that if I were a vampire, I would want to bite her at once.\nAdilun began to imagine the spell, madly engrossed in it, as if she forgot to pay attention to anything else once she started concentrating.\nAs a stranger to magic, of course, I couldn’t figure out what she was doing, but at least I could tell that what she was doing wasn’t normal.\n'A magic that had only briefly appeared before. If that magic was complete, well... What will happen?' I asked myself while watching her.\nI put my hand on my chin and continued to look at her.\nJust looking at her made me feel satisfied. And one more thought came to me suddenly.\n'Do I really have to swear at someone like her? Even though it’s what she wants… … I-I just didn’t like it.'\nBy hearing my swearwords, she would inevitably be hurt. She would say 'I’m fine', but I couldn’t help but worry.\nShe was a kind person. Otherwise, there was no way the maids and servants would have followed her like that.\nI felt like I should give it some thought. For example, ignoring her coldly… …Is a little better way to do it.\n'I’ll have to talk with her.'\nAfter a considerable amount of time had passed, Adilun stretched and turned her attention to me for a moment.\n“Haa… … ! Hey Physis. Have you been here just watching me all along?”\n“Yes. There is nothing to do, and the books here are not things I would understand from looking at them.”\n“Uh, um. Then you can just leave.”\n“Fine. Actually, it wasn’t that boring.”\n“Yes? why?”\n“Having your hair tied up suits you very well. I just looked at them, what more do I need?”\nI answered honestly.\n“Oh, don’t keep saying things like that. It's just embarrassing…!! …”\n“By the way, Adilun.”\n“Yes?”\n“There is something I want to say about the social gathering, no matter how I look at it… … Well, I’m a bit reluctant to treat you like I used to.”\n“I already told you... I’m fine. Having been treated like that for a year already by you, it can be said that I have developed some kind of immunity.”\nAdilun didn’t seem to take it seriously, but we wouldn’t know until it actually happened.\nOriginally, human psychology is extremely complicated, and there are times when people have doubts even though they know that it just acting.\n“Still, that’s a bit… …”\n“I’m really fine, don’t worry.”\n“I will have to think more... By the way, are you done with your magic plan?”\n“Yes. It’s almost done, but I plan to try this later. It’s not urgent right now.”\n“Aha.”\n“Well, then… … I’m going to get hungry soon, so let’s go get something to eat.”\nAdilun said so and rose from her seat.\nShe still had her hair tied up.\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\nTime passed quickly, and the day the social gathering was held arrived. We headed straight to Daevaton.\nDaevaton wasn’t that wealthy, so they couldn’t install a teleportation gate, and because of that, we had no choice but to ride in a wagon.\nI looked at Physis, who was sitting next to me in the wagon, with a somewhat nervous attitude. He, too, had a hardened face. Was it because of nervousness, or was it because he felt complicated as he was trying to treat me like he used to?\nIn fact, there was a reason why I was trying to make him insult me like before.\nThis was my last test for him. Apart from the promise, a final test to get rid of the uneasiness that lingers inside me.\nIf he… … If there was a sign of guilt when he said harsh words to me this time, I would no longer feel insecure about him.\n'Please. I hope...'\nEvery single day after shedding my scale, I was honestly really happy.\nPhysis was always kind to me and listened to everything even when I was capricious and foolish.\nI hoped that his heart was sincere, and I wished that this life would not end.\nI felt really sorry for him, but I had no choice but to test him on my own.\n'Later, I must apologize to him.'\nPhysis continued to fret. But I was rather relieved by that appearance.\n“Calm down, Physis. As I said, I’m fine.”\n“Ah, sorry to upset you, Adilun. I keep thinking about the past… …”\nI held his hand silently.\n“It’s okay. It’s acting anyway. So don’t worry too much. Instead, be sure to identify those who are against me, including Selina.”\n“… … Alright.”\n'Have you calmed down for a while?'\nHe looked out the window with a much calmer expression.\n“Hey, I see Daevaton Castle.”\n“It’s a solid-looking castle.”\n“I guess so. There are quite a few monsters nearby… … If they don’t build a strong fortress, they will have to fall under the threat of monsters.”\n“Should we do it as soon as we get off the wagon?”\n“No. Rather than that, let’s make our position official first… …You’re gossiping about me, you have to decide how to do it so that I can fit in there.”\n“Haa. For now, I will try.”\nHe sighed, clutching his head as if in pain.\nI looked at him and smiled a bit bitterly. I made him do terrible things to me.\nBut what was this little anxiety? If I had accepted his attitude, it would have been a little more comfortable.\nBut to do that, I wasn’t sure about myself. A person’s mind easily changed. A very small insecurity remaining in me could eventually prevent me from accepting him.\nSo I decided to walk the thorny path.\nI didn't know what will be at the end of that thorny road, but at least my heart will be relieved.\nNow, there was not much time life before the play begins.\n* * *\n[Physis's POV]\nArriving at Daevaton Castle, I got off the carriage. Then I reached out to Adilun from outside the carriage.\nShe took my hand and came out, and soon she was revealed, adorned to the fullest with vivid beauty.\nDark blue hair resembling the night sky in a ponytail fluttered, and the bluish-white horns curled on top of her head made her look unapproachable.\nThe clothes were also made by the artisans of Rodenov with great care and were so beautiful, that even I, who didn't know much about women’s clothes, couldn't help but admire them.\nLike the color of the scales she wore before, the bluish-white dress was somewhat bold, revealing her shoulders, but a dark blue shawl was wrapped around it to cover the boldness.\nAlso, a noble silver tiara nestled atop her head, between horns, as if to prove she was the heir to the mighty Duchy of Rodenov.\nOriginally, only the daughters of dukes or princesses, the highest rank among nobles, could wear the tiara, so this tiara was a symbol of her authority here.\nAfter I couldn’t take my eyes off her for a while, she urged me on with a soft smile.\n“Am I that pretty?”\n“Yes.”\nSeriously, I had no choice but to say that. Then, as if she was happy with that, she gave me another dazzling smile and took my hand, and led me.\n“Come on, let’s go quickly, Physis. The play has to start soon.”\n“Maybe… … There will be an uproar.”\n“Yes? For what?”\n“You’ll find out when you get in.”\nThis… … Today, my teeth were likely to be significantly damaged.\nIf she and I acted as planned and approached them, there would surely be some unscrupulous people who would try to approach Adilun.\n'Damn.'\nOur plan was as follows.\nFirst, in the banquet hall, she and I, who had the highest rank, would have our first dance.\nAfter that, while I was away for a while… … Adilun would secretly spread gossip about me to other princesses that treated me harshly.\nThough Adilun stubbornly refused. She thought it would make it easier for me to gossip about her, so in the end, I had to accept it.\nWe stood side by side in front of the door. The attendants guarding the door of the banquet hall began to widen their eyes as they looked at Adilun and me.\nWhen they saw the horns on her head, they realized that she was Adilun, and opened the door.\nA call was soon heard.\n“Rodenov’s rightful heir! Princess Adilun Rodenov and Ortaire’s second son, Sir Physis Ortaire, winner of the National Day Hunting Competition and Jousting tournament, is entering!”\nFinally, the door opened.\n[ TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to\nread up to the 5 chapters ahead\nof the release: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007]",

      "content": "49 – Fishing (1)\n[Selina Idenea's POV]\nSelina was enjoying the attention she received at the social gathering. It was because banquets such as social gatherings were always quite enjoyable for her, who had a rather outstanding appearance.\nBut today was even special for her, as Princess Rodenov was coming. Selina was eagerly awaiting her arrival.\nShe always drew attention even more than the Princess of Rodenov, who had enormous and absolute prestige, and countless compliments poured on herself. Moreover, the appearance of Princess Rodenov falling in comparison with herself was very thrilling to her.\nWhat she enjoyed the most was watching the moment when a person with a higher prestige than herself eventually degenerated into someone inferior to her.\nShe knew herself to be a rather lowly human being.\nSelina was aware that she was the kind of person who was jealous of others and enjoyed making other people deprived of attention, so she could also see that this tendency was the kind of habit she shouldn’t reveal to others.\nSo she formed a group, where she didn’t have much to do.\nIt was because Selina's followers drove those out who were against her without her needing to step up.\nBecause of that, she just had to set the tone. So she had been able to hide her bad habits all this time.\nAs she was the daughter of a prestigious count and also had a great appearance, there were quite a few princesses who clung to Selina and tried to get closer to her.\nThat was why Selina had the confidence to be the main character of any social gathering. In particular, she was looking forward to this day more, because she remembered the image of Physis Ortaire she had seen in the previous Great Duel.\nHe was wonderful. His appearance was also very beautiful, and he even beat the winner of the National Day martial arts competition with his overwhelming skills, he would become a fairly famous knight in the future. Too bad. To think that such a person should be dedicated to that monstrous princess.\n‘No, no. Should I just take him? If he is taken away, what expression will that monster princess make?’\nWhile her outrageous imagination expanded into the realm of absurd delusions, she was able to arrive at the banquet hall where the social gathering was being held.\nSeveral princesses were jealous of her, and many showed interest in her and tried to talk to her one more time. Among them, a handsome man approached her and waved.\n“A long time no see. Selina.”\nAs soon as William started talking to Selina, the people around her started talking among themselves, avoiding their seats. Because they all knew that the two of them had always hated having their conversations overheard.\n“Yes. Long time no see, William. But what kind of social gathering is this all of a sudden?”\n“Do you need to have any other intentions for the fraternity party? I just wanted to see each other’s faces. Seeing our monster princess after a long time is also included.”\n“Wouldn’t it be better not to say such things outright? Do you want to play Great Duel too? It’s a shame since no one listens to us right now, if we did it somewhere else, this very social gathering would be the last of you, right?”\n“What? It’s true. Tsk, Just thinking about it gives me goosebumps.”\n“Ah, indeed. Did you have a phobia of reptiles? Since the old times, I have been trembling whenever I see a lizard. But doesn’t Princess Rodenov look like a lizard? The skeleton is completely human, only her skin is scaly.”\n“Shut up. After all, it’s true that she has scales. anyway, I don't know why the nobles living in Rodenov say that the blood of such a monster is so sacred and great.”\n“Well, it could be. Since there is also a legend of ancestors, Princess Rodenov is a living witness of that legend. Of course, not all of the North is Rodenov, but… … Because Rodenov’s influence is the strongest. Be careful. Daevaton can also be like Aiden.”\n“We should be. Anyway, what are you planning to do today?”\n“What, is there anything special? I should just enjoy it.”\n“You are thinking of grabbing another person and driving him away. You’d better be careful, right?”\n“It’s not true!”\nSelina smiled and retorted William’s words.\n“No. No matter how I look at it, it looks like you have a lot of plans.”\n“No, nothing special. It’s just that I rather like Prince Ortaire.”\n“Isn’t that man a bit dangerous?”\n“How do you know that?”\n“I can feel it just by looking at him. Well, you better not touch him.”\n“Why? I think I heard rumors about Ortaire’s mad dog when he was engaged to Rodenov last year… … Is his personality that bad? When I think of Great Duel or National Foundation Day, he was rather very gentlemanly.”\n“He just doesn’t seem like that.”\n“What?”\n“I don’t feel well about him.”\n“Feeling? With just that?”\n“Do you even know how many monsters I sliced and ate?”\n“Ah. You must have been a knight too.”\n“You...”\n“Anyway, does your knight’s intuition say that Physis Ortaire is dangerous?”\n“Yes. It would be best not to get involved. I don’t want to run into you with your neck turned.”\n“Do you really have to be so cruel to your friend?”\n“It’s because of you, you idiot. Don’t make a big deal out of being seduced by a guy with a smooth face, take care of yourself.”\n“That’s something I’ll figure out.”\nWhen Selina spoke dissatisfiedly, William only sighed as if he was too tired to speak. At that time, a servant came to William’s side.\n“Sir.”\n“What’s going on?”\n“The carriage of the Rodenov has arrived.”\n“I get it.”\n“Did they arrive?”\nSelina, who heard it from the side, asked William with a curious expression.\n“What’s new after you’ve heard it anyway?”\n“Anyway, I’d like you to go then.”\n“Yes. See you later. Don’t get hit.”\n“Be careful.”\nSelina separated from William and mingled with the crowd of princesses she used to be with. To a place where everyone compliments each other's pretense and praises them.\nThe story they were talking about today was also repeated in the past. But Selina liked even that. The cycle was no different from the cycleof interest and happiness.\n“Rodenov’s rightful heir! Princess Adilun Rodenov and Ortaire’s second son, Sir Physis Ortaire, winner of the National Day Hunting Competition and Jousting, is entering!”\nEventually, the voice of a servant who had been standing in front of the door all day shouting about the position of the nobles was heard, and the door opened.\nAnd Selina couldn’t help but be astonished at the sight that was revealed.\nNo, it wasn’t just a story limited to Selina. Everyone there was in a huge shock.\nDark blue hair tied up and a tiara on top.\nA bluish-white dress that wasn’t overdone and showed off the wearer’s charm with a shawl that covered her shoulders in a color similar to her hair.\nAnd sharp golden eyes that even looked somewhat decadent.\nThe reason why everyone was shocked was because of a beautiful woman who could be called a goddess in common words.\nEven if she was so beautiful to simply focus everyone’s attention on her, the servant’s previous words just heard passed through everyone’s mind, and their gaze turned to the woman’s head.\nBlue-white horns.\nLooking at something that could never be seen as a human being, they finally realized who that tremendously beautiful beauty was.\nAdilun Rodenov.\nWho was called the monster princess, the successor of Rodenov who had been ostracized everywhere except Rodenov.\nHer golden eyes scanned the banquet hall with a sharp gaze, and everyone who touched them shivered as if their feet were numb.\nAnd at that moment, everyone present had a hunch that Adilun would be the one to receive the most attention at this social gathering.\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\nI looked at the scenery of the banquet hall.\nThey were really ugly. No matter how important appearance was, was it enough to send admiration and praise in an instant to the person they hated so much?\nIt was pathetic. Laughter flowed out. Had I still worn the scales, those gazes would have been filled with disgust and contempt.\nOn the other hand, what about Physis? Even though he was the first to see my change, he was worried about my safety first.\nHe was worried that the scales had fallen off, that something was wrong with my body, or that I was in more serious pain.\nI realized all over again that he was a different person from them.\nHolding hands with Physis, I moved forward.\nWas this the gaze of those who didn’t even pay attention to me? I felt disgusted all over again.\nThe soggy gaze began to cling. A gaze filled with shady desire. It was a look I’d never received before the scales fell off.\nA sneer of disgust escaped from my lips.\n“Are you okay, Adilun?”\nI heard a cautious question from the side. It might be difficult to hear because of the noise, but I could always hear his words.\n“Yes. it’s okay. It is rather funny.”\n“You will have to get used to being stared at like that. You will experience it often in the future too.”\n“It’s okay because I’m prepared. Anyway, are you ready?”\n“Yes. That's why I'm not even looking at you. To be honest, I am very sorry.”\n“You looked at me from the wagon a while ago.”\n“Even so… … It’s quite upsetting that they can see you and I can’t.”\nPhysis, who threw trivial words, perhaps to relieve my tension, gave me joy. In this disgusting place, he was the only one who could make me laugh.\nHowever… … Now it was time to catch the fish. Perhaps there would be coldness in that gaze, and we would spit out gossip toward each other.\nOur plan was simple. To gossip about each other when people get together after the first dance.\nThat alone will catch a lot of people. We’ll spit out bad stories about each other.\nTheir future actions were clear at a glance. Princesses who cut me down out of jealousy will approach Physis, and Princes who wanted to do something to me out of shady desire will cut Physis down.\nThis was a friendly party. Originally, it was a place where you should build friendships.\nBut for me and Physis, it was nothing more than a fishing ground for those who were against us.\n[ TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to\nread up to the 5 chapters ahead\nof the release: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007]",

      "content": "50 – Fishing (2)\n[Physis's POV]\nThe banquet hall was quite lively with the sound of chatter and laughter. However, upon our arrival, the attention in the room shifted toward us. In particular, all eyes were fixed on Adilun.\nAll kinds of shady glances mixed with admiration and jealousy were directed at her, but unfortunately, there was nothing I could do right now. Because I was in a situation where I had to treat her coldly.\nI was quite dissatisfied with that because even though everyone was looking at her, I had to turn my eyes away from her.\nMoreover, even I had to speak bad words about her in front of the other princesses. I couldn’t help but sharpen my nerves.\nThe warmth that radiated from our clasped hands was a little sad.\nAfter receiving a formal greeting that was not at all sincere, Adilun and I stood at the center of the banquet hall. The first dance eventually came back to us because Adilunwas the highest-ranking noble representing the northern nobility.\nI tried to look at her with irritation and coldness in my gaze.\nIn response, Adilun also gave me a cold gaze.\nIt was the first time we were looking at each other like this since we met as soon as I realized my previous life. I felt like I was in the middle of a snowstorm right now.\nA slight chill ran through my body for an instant, but I didn’t try to express it.\n“Adilun.”\n“Shh. Don’t say anything.”\n“… …Yes.”\n“I’m sorry for asking too much. Just for today, just for today, please be patient.”\nAs the golden eyes instantly erased the coldness and embraced the gentleness and apologetic feelings, my twisted heart began to loosen little by little.\nAs she wished, I looked at her coldly.\nAnd at that moment, calm music came out and a rather creaky dance began.\nIt was a terrible dance that couldn’t be compared to the dance I had danced with her a few days ago.\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\nFeet don’t fit each other. Breathing was also starting to become disturbed little by little.\nA dance that was lousy no matter who saw it. Since I was quite confident in dancing, it was even a little humiliating to dance like this.\nAn uncomfortable feeling raised its head a little.\nAs a result, Physis held my hand tighter.\nFrom the moment I felt a little discomfort, he somehow noticed and comforted me.\nThat was why the uncomfortable feeling quickly disappeared.\nI raised my head and looked at him. I felt a cold stare linger on me. It was really unsightly, but even though I requested it from him, a place in my heart instantly tingled.\nBut I didn’t bother. From the start, he was against it. I shouldn’t have that mindset after forcing him.\nAfter a while, the flowing music stopped, and the dance finally ended. I could hear the buzz around the dance and feel the cacophony of harmonious harmonies.\n“What happened? It is quite different from the dance I saw at the National Foundation Day.”\n“Why? I can't understand this… …Could it be that they fought?”\n“It can’t be. For the insult of Princess Rodenov, Prince Ortaire himself went all the way to the great duel.”\nA voice mixed with questions began to be heard in our ears. And I felt that this was the best time to start acting.\nAs the dance ended, his hand which was holding my hand took advantage of the loose gap and stroked vigorously.\nPercussion!\nDon’t forget, Adilun.\nMy gaze became cold, remembering the insults he had done to me in the past.\nRemembering him, who remained only as a trace in me, I revealed the feelings I had that time on my face, hinting that I was angry.\nPhysis paused and stood there. His cold gaze was fixed on me. My eyes were not different from that either.\nMy heart was pounding.\nPhysis was the one who made the first move. He turned his head and walked away, leaving me behind.\nFor a moment, my heart stopped. And disbelief started rising inside me.\n'Do I really have to do this?'\nCould it be that I was unwilling to admit that he was changing?\nI could not erase the mistakes he made to me, but now that he was changing, shouldn't I forget those things? Maybe I thought too high of myself?\nSuddenly, I thought that if someone else saw me like that, our plan would be distorted.\n* * *\n[Physis's POV]\nThe surroundings were noisy. Leaving the fuss behind, I sat down in a suitable seat, rested my chin on my arm, and narrowed my eyes.\nWould this have been enough smoke?\nI slightly turned my gaze to look at Adilun.\nWith her expression completely distorted, she headed in the opposite direction from me.\nNo matter who saw it, we looked no different from a couple who had fallen out with each other.\nIt was frustrating to sit still and sip drinks. The turmoil around was still there. It was laughable to see them smile and chat to see me and Adilun fighting.\nThey didn't even know that it was our plan to fish them all out.\nI fiddled with the magic tool for recording in my arms.\nNow it was about time to get a bait. Maybe other guys will stick to Adilun too.\nJust thinking about it made me angry, but I tried to hold it in. Perhaps, in the eyes of others, I would look like I was trying to calm down my anger at Adilun.\nAnd shortly after, someone approached me as we expected.\nIt was a woman with red hair. Unlike the color of her hair, and crimson eyes full of confidence, I could tell who she was, just by looking at her appearance.\nSelina Idenea.\nIndeed, she was exactly as Adilun had explained. I had heard that she had participated in the National Foundation Day, but I had never actually seen her.\n“Are you alright, Sir Physis Ortaire?”\nShe looked at me with a worried expression.\n“Oh, excuse me. Perhaps… …”\n“I'm Selina of Idenea. I think you can just call me Selina.”\n“Yes. Princess Selina. Do you need something?”\n“Oh, nothing special, I just wanted to have a little chat.”\n“I don’t think the princess and I were that friendly.”\n“Don’t be too hard on yourself. As we talk, we become friends little by little.”\nEven if her face looked pretty good and she was strong, I didn't really like the way she smiled and talked. But our efforts would be in vain if I didn't talk to her.\nStill, I didn’t bother to express it. Because I still had work to do.\n“Well, do whatever you want. I used to have a headache because of an annoying woman, but it turned out better.”\n“Who is that annoying woman?”\n“You already know everything, don’t you?”\nI looked at Selina dissatisfiedly and said.\n“But why did you fight? After fighting so hard for Princess Rodenov during the Great duel.”\n“There are many things... We just don't fit. She is a woman who is very eager to get hold of me. So what if you take off your scales and get smooth skin? Do you try to control people?”\nI put out a lot of words that I didn’t even want to say. The fact that I had to say such a thing was unpleasant to me, and I wondered what if Adilun listened attentively.\nIn the end, the concentration of annoyance engraved on my face and had no choice but to become thicker.\n“Aha… …”\n“I can’t cancel my engagement, so it’s just frustrating. I knew from the beginning that our personalities didn’t match. Since it was an engagement my father forced in the first place, I had no right to refuse.”\n“By the way, when Princess Rodenov was insulted by Aiden, during the land battle, during the joust… … It didn't feel like you were forced to?”\n“That was all acting. I think that would ease the pressure on me a little. And in the great duel, they promised to guarantee my freedom if I fought well, they will not interfere with me. But now, they suddenly changed their words.”\n“Oh my gosh.”\n“Anyway, that’s how it is.”\n“Lord Physis hates being oppressed.”\n“How many people in the world like to be oppressed? I want to live freely. I can’t help it.”\n“Oops. Drink this first and let go of your anger. That handsome face... isn’t it a waste to frown like that?”\n“Am I good-looking?”\n“You are the most handsome man I’ve ever seen.”\n“Well, thank you for your kind words.”\n“It’s not just out of being poilte… …\"\n“Is that so? I ask for your understanding in advance if my tone is unpleasant. Because I'm a guy who is only used to fighting.”\n“Ahahahaha. it’s okay. Anyway, I’ve seen a lot of strong men. Sir Physis is a nobleman.”\n“This is a place where I don’t like anything, but… … But right now, it’s not too bad.”\nI deliberately threw the bait at Selina.\n“Me too. Why bother telling people to come?”\n“Selina seems to be quite dissatisfied… … Let it go. I will listen.”\nThe way of addressing her was also changed from princess to her name. As if that had worked, she gradually began to tell her story.\nOf course.\nThey were just trivial stories that did not inspire me at all.\n[ TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to\nread up to the 5 chapters ahead\nof the release: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007]",

      "content": "51 – Fishing (3)\n[Adilun's POV]\nI could see Physis talking with Selina, who had bright red hair, contrasting to my dark blue hair.\nFrom the time we first met, Selina was a strangely intrusive person.\nEven at a glance, it was clear to me that the person in question was the polar opposite of myself.\nSeeing such a woman wagging her tail at Physis, dark emotions welled up inside me.\nI knew that it was just an act.\nBut still, it was quite hard to see Physis gossipingabout me in front of a woman like that.\n'Isn’t that contradictory?'\nIf I didn’t want to see him like that, I shouldn't have forced him to do this act.\nBut I couldn’t help it. Because I needed reassurance.\n'Physis… … I’m sure you won’t turn your back on me.'\n“You seem to be in a lot of trouble, Princess Rodenov.”\n“Ah, Sir William Devaton.”\nAs I was looking at Physis, suddenly William Devarton came and started talking to me.\nAt that, I hardened my expression.\n“I was surprised that you changed so drastically. It’s a pity that such a beautiful figure was covered by such scales.”\n'Even if he says something like that now, does he thinks I will get over everything?'\nThe situation was quite ridiculous, to the extent that even someone who despised me remarked that I looked different. The person in front of me had an unappealing demeanor that made me feel repulsed to the point where just facing him made hatred run through my body.\n“Don't you have anything to do?”\n“It’s not that I don’t have much to do… … But... You look uncomfortable.”\n“Then just go. Let's not talk. As Sir said, I am very, very, very uncomfortable right now.”\nWilliam’s expression hardened at my words, without the slightest hint of lies. That stiff face was unsightly.\n“And sir.”\n“Yes?”\n“You also don’t want to see a monster face today. You didn’t think I wouldn’t know, did you? These are the words you have told me.”\n“What do you mean by that?”\nIt was shameless to see him drop his pretense. Did he think I didn't hear? No, he knew but was pretending not to know.\n“A monster princess with disgusting scales… … . Who said this? But now that you’ve come and talked to me, it’s disgusting.”\n“That’s… … !”\n“As you say, I am a monster, so my senses are a bit more developed than others. Seeing you in the first place, I didn’t want to come to a place like this at all… …. Be grateful that I came because I thought of your family’s face.”\nHis expression contorted.\n'Well, he should have been careful.'\n“And tell your friends too. If they don’t want to be roasted by magic, refrain their filthy mouth.”\nWith those words, I distanced myself from him.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nI was in a bad mood.\nBut there was still work to be done. I thought Physis will start acting now… …Wanting to focus on that a little bit, I quietly strengthened my hearing.\nAmidst the noise of the banquet hall, a pleasant low-pitched voice and a voice that was annoying to hear were blending together. It was definitely the voices of Physis and Selina.\n“So Sir Physis is forced to stay in Rodenow right now?”\n“You can see that. To be honest, it’s disgusting and uncomfortable. Rodenov is the worst place for me.”\nAs soon as I heard that, my expression naturally turned miserable. even though I knew that everything he said was acting.\n'No. Could it be that he is actually thinking that in his heart?'\n'The place I love the most... is it, in fact, the place he hates the most?'\nThe anxiety buried in a corner of my mind was slowly becoming real.\n'No. That's not true, He is just acting.'\nI comforted myself and focused on their conversation to catch the timing when I needed to step out.\nAnd finally…\n…Physis started talking about me.\n“I hate Princess Rodenov. It wouldn’t change anything if she took off those terrible scales now. Just looking at her fills me with disgust.”\nHearing this, even knowing it was acting, made my heart ache.\nI walked towards them, matching his cold voice.\nSelina and Physis looked at me with puzzled expressions, and I looked back at them with my still distorted expression.\n'Ah, sorry!'\n- Smack!!\nWith a silent apology in my mind, I fiercely hit Physis on the cheek.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThe hand that slapped his cheek tingled.\n'Oh...'\n'Ah... No... Did I hit too hard?'\nEven though I knew it was an act, I was emotionally agitated by the gossip coming out of his mouth, so I unknowingly slapped him on the cheek so hard.\nPhysis covered his cheeks with a bewilderedexpressionand in a moment, he looked at me with a very soft smile. It was for a short time that it would be impossible to know unless someone was looking at him from the front.\nStrangely it looked like he was saying that I did well.\n“What are you doing?”\nCold words flowed from his mouth, but his expression was different from his cold words.\nThe doubt that he would suddenly change began to disappear from my heart, and instead, a belief that he was not just acting started to fill it up little by little.\n“What am I doing? If you spread gossip about me like that, did you think I wouldn’t know?”\n“Ugh. So, did I say something that wasn’t true?”\n“At least it’s something we should have solved ourselves.”\n“How would I solve an issue with someone I can’t communicate with?”\n“Do you know that the same goes for you?”\nWe continued acting. I teamed up with him and released bad words about each other.\nEven so, the expression he looked at me with was exciting, like seeing something interesting, but I was sure of one thing.\nHe didn't seem angry with me. Even if I did something stupid like this.\nI felt a little bit sad, and I shed a tear without even realizing it.\nHis face, which had been relaxed all along, turned to bewilderment, and I felt that the surroundings were in a commotion from the tears I shed.\nIn the end, people intervened between us and stopped our quarrel, and the banquet ended like that.\nHaving successfully ruined the social gathering, I returned to the accommodation given to me with a slightly pounding heart.\nAs soon as I entered the room, my legs gave up without even realizing it, and I sat down.\nWith the attitude of Physis I saw today, I was finally able to be sure that he would not turn his back on me.\n'Thank god. really, I’m really glad.'\nHowever, the feeling of guilt continued to grow.\n'How the hell am I supposed to apologize to him?'\nWorry and anxiety began to rise in my heart.\nEven if the situation was over, the disapproval he felt for me could still be there, so apart from the expression he showed me earlier, he could have come to hate me.\n'I hate that.'\nI didn’t like him chatting with other girls, and I didn’t want him to hate me. So I wanted to see his face and apologize quickly, but I couldn’t even go to his room.\n'No. Wait a minute.'\nThere was a way.\n'Couldn’t I use the invisibility magic and sneak into his room?'\nThe method that came to my mind seemed pretty good, so I immediately deployed the invisibility magic on my body.\nConfirming my disappearance in the mirror, I moved toward Physis’s room.\n* * *\n[Physis's POV]\nMy cheeks tingled from being hit by Adilun. Judging by how sharp her hands were, I was sure that she could learn any martial arts quickly.\nEven though I tried to distract myself with such idle thoughts, Adilun’s crying face still flickered in front of my eyes.\nSeeing her like that my mood turned pretty terrible, so when Selina asked me if I was okay, I nodded and went straight into my room.\n'I should have talked to her… … What should I do? Shall I secretly sneak into her room? I have already remembered the structure of the mansion, so it might be okay.'\nThe banquet was ruined by the two of us, so there was nothing to do, and from tomorrow onwards, there would be quite a few princesses approaching me.\nAll I had to do was now to sort out Adilun’s enemies and allies… …It was better to unravel Adilun’s heart today. Because she seemed to be very hurt.\nWith this thought in mind, when I opened the door, I could feel that there was someone in front of me, although there was no one in front.\nWhen I activated my senses, thinking it might be a trickle, I began to see the shape of Adilun, shimmering in front of my eyes.\n“Adilun… …?”\nAs soon as I called her name, she entered my room and closed the door.\nAfter closing the door, she revealed herself to me. Apparently, it seemed that she used invisible magic.\nAfter canceling the invisibility magic, she immediately handed me an apology.\n“I-I’m sorry. It hurts a lot, right?”\nAdilun said that and stroked my cheek.\n“Okay, it’s okay. I’m also really sorry. I spoke too harshly…”\nIn the momentary warmth that hit me, I couldn’t help but stutter without even realizing it, and she shook her head vigorously, startled by my words.\n“It’s what I said you to do. So I'm fine too...”\nHowever, the expression on her face when she said that seemed quite dangerous.\n“Are you really okay? Please tell me the truth.”\nI gave her a worried look, and she let out a sigh, perhaps realizing it, she opened her mouth.\n“No. Actually, I'm not okay. Even though I know it’s acting, my heart hurts so much… …I-I’m so sorry. I’ve done a bad thing to you... I just shouldn’t have done this.”\nLittle by little, tears started to form in her eyes. It was quite heartbreaking to see her like that.\nI grabbed her hand as she stroked my cheek and held her in my arms.\n“It’s really okay, don’t cry.”\n“No. I... I... Physis, it was a test.\"\n\"I know that.\"\n\"You know that I tested you on my own. But you still want to forgive me like this?”\n“It’s okay. Because I know the truth that why you were trying to test me. Perhaps you were also anxious. You must have thought that I might suddenly turn my back on you... And I would become like I was in the past.”\n“… …Yes.”\n“So I understand why you did this. Because I knew that the wounds I inflicted on you during the year were quite large. You must have had your own reassurance. But are you sure now that I won’t turn my back on you anymore?”\n“Yes. Yes.”\n“Why is that? why are you sure now?”\n“When you looked at me earlier, looking at that expression… … I-I was sure. So I’m even more sorry. I was selfishly testing someone like you.”\n“That’s fortunate. Anyway, I forgave you, so don’t feel guilty.”\n“… …Y-yes.”\nI loosened my arms and let her go. Adilun stared at me with her swollen, red eyes, then smiled broadly and said.\n“Thanks, Physis. I will trust you now.”\n“It is such an honor.”\nMy heart raced for a moment, but I didn’t show it, I replied to her playfully and smiled at her.\n'Little by little, little by little...'\n'If we move forward step by step like this, that time will surely come someday.'\n'I’ll wait for that time.'\n[ TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to\nread up to the 5 chapters ahead\nof the release: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007]",

      "content": "52 – Awareness and Jealousy (1)\n[Adilun's POV]\nI looked at Physis, who gave me a mischievous laugh.\nHis every action started being engraved in my mind like a painting; The way he hugged me and told me not to cry and the way he looked at me with kindness in his eyes.\nI was finally able to be sure now of the fact that he won’t betray me and that he won’t turn his back on my trust.\nAnd as soon as I realized that… …It was difficult to take my eyes off his face. And all of a sudden, my heart started beating fast.\nThe change didn't stop there. As I looked at him, the heat started to build up on my face. I was already perplexed by the incomprehensible situation when Physis asked me as well.\n“Adilun? What's wrong?”\n“Yes, what?”\n“Your face is becoming red? Are you catching a cold again?”\nSaying that Physis tried to put his hand on my forehead, but I immediately stepped back and told him.\n“No, wait. I’m really fine. Look, there is no pain anywhere.”\n“But then why…”\n“That’s just embarrassing. The fact that you treat me as a child like this. So I’m done!”\nI immediately cast an invisibility spell and disappeared, exiting his room and sprinting at full speed into my room.\n'No way? No. It can't be.'\nNot knowing what the heck it was, I threw myself on the bed and tried to clear my head.\n'Don’t even think about it. It’s not what you think.'\n'That... No! I just did it because I was ashamed of my own childishness.'\nI repeated that, but Physis’s face keep coming to my mind.\nHe smiled at me affectionately, which always reminded me of his worrying about me, and the heat on my face intensified. My heart also started beating like crazy, as if I had lost control over it.\nIn the end, I couldn’t help but stay up all night with Physis constantly invading my head.\nAnd there was one conclusion I reached while staying up all night; that even though I said I would never fall for him, I had already fallen for him... For Physis: the person who once cursed and insulted me, but on realizing his mistakes, he respected and cared for me.\n* * *\n[Physis's POV]\nThe day was bright. Ignoring Adilun's strange behavior yesterday, I was preparing myself for what I had to do.\nQuite a few princesses, who didn't like Adilun, would be approaching me because they had seen Adilun and I fight yesterday.\nI would have to figure out the tendencies of the princesses and distinguish between those who were hostile to Adilun and those rare ones who were repulsed by being hostile to her.\nHonestly, I didn't usually get involved in politics during social gatherings like this. However, you never know what you might have to do based on circumstances.\nThere might be some princesses who'd reject Adilun willingly, while others might have to support those princesses' decisions under pressure. I had no intention of forcefully confronting them today though.\nInstead, I thought of testing their personalities and checking whether they were hostile toward us. This would help Adilun secure the Rodenov later on.\nOf course, we would have to deal with those who opposed us in a subtle manner, and take appropriate measures against them.\nFor example, Selina Idenea.\nShe was displeased with Adilun being the main character of this social gathering.\nOriginally, She would have tried to do something to Adilun, but since Adilun's appearance had changed and everyone at the social gathering started to take an interest in her, she must be very frustrated.\nWhat’s more, with Adilun and I acting of having such a big fight yesterday, her interest will definitely increase... either in a negative or positive way.\nWith those thoughts in mind, I arrived at the banquet hall.\nUnfortunately, on the surface, Adilun and I fought, so we couldn’t enter together. I was sure she would come in a little while… … Until then, I decided to take a look at the other princesses.\nWhen the door of the banquet hall opened and I entered, I saw people dancing and chatting freely as if the banquet had already started.\nAt the same time, someone found me entering the banquet hall.\nIn particular, the stakes of talking with the princesses were high, and their eyes were twinkling as they looked at me.\nHowever, seeing that they were not approaching me directly, they must be looking for an opportunity - like a dance or something - to have a conversation with me\nAnd I knew very well why they would do that.\nTo them, I’d look pretty attractive.\nMy physical strength was considerable, I also won the National Day hunting competition and a jousting match, and my face was quite good too… … So it was understandable enough.\nBut I didn’t like that fact.\nBecause at this moment, the only person's attention I desired was Adilun's; I didn't need anyone else's.\nIt was likely that many guys had already taken notice of Adilun's beauty, as she had become increasingly stunning\nFurthermore, since she showed a fierce fight with her fiancé, me, some parasites would look out for her to take my place.\nRemembering that those were the same people who treated her as a monster earlier, I felt anger rising in my heart.\nOf course, even I, once insulted her, so maybe I didn't have any right to say that...\nBut it was hard to hide my discomfort; as people who were fascinated by her changed appearance would inevitably come out and try to comment on it.\nAs I was frowning, the familiar red hair girl began to approach me.\nIt was Selina.\nShe, who probably had considerable influence among the princesses, approached me with more confident steps than anyone else and asked for a dance.\n“Sir Physis. How about a dance with me?”\nPerhaps starting with this, I would suffer from a lot of dancing today, and I would have to have all sorts of conversations with the princesses.\nTo be honest, I didn’t even want to dance unless it was with Adilun… … But all of this would be an act for her, so I reluctantly nodded.\n“Let’s dance.”\n“Your cheeks… … Are they okay now?”\n“It didn’t hurt too much anyway. It just made me feel dirty.”\n“Oops… … I never imagined that Princess Rodenov would be such a rough-handed person.”\n“It’s something I already knew, so it’s nothing new. Still, Miss Selina… … I'm glad you’re not as violent as that woman.”\n“Hehehe. Really?”\n“Yeah. I can tell at once when I see the attitude of caring for others in your words and actions.”\n“Thank you, even if it's just formality.”\nShe smiled and told me. The words I said just to buy favor seemed to be overly effective, so it seemed like it would be okay to use them on other princesses.\n“It is not empty words. I’m just a person whose feelings come out of his mouth.”\n“Aha, is that so?”\n“That’s why it’s difficult to expect a gentlemanly appearance. Sometimes I look like an idiot. That’s also the biggest reason Princess Rodenov hates me.”\n“Well, still, she didn't need to be so harsh, right?”\n“That’s the first time someone supported me…”\n“I guess so, people are like that... By the way, Isn't she just jealous because you look so handsome?”\n“Handsome… … Am I that good-looking?”\n“Yeah. Compared to any man I’ve ever seen… … No, one would be an idiot if they compared other men with you... You look amazing.”\n“Hahahaha. First of all, thank you.”\nI deliberately laughed and lied.\nLooks, looks, looks...\nWhy did people reject anyone by attaching so much meaning to their appearance?\nThe appearance was obviously an important factor in dealing with people.\nBut that didn't mean looks were everything. Did they ever try to hear the story of others?\nDid they ever try to hear the story of Adilun before her scales fell off?\nThey didn't and they won't. They must have rejected her just because she was surrounded by scales.\nLooking at such people, I was able to realize again how disgusting and terrible I was before remembering my previous life.\n'Yes. I hate my old self.'\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\nAfter staying up all night over yesterday’s new realization, I was terribly tired. However, my mind was strangely clear, so I dressed up with a hazy look and entered the banquet hall.\nIt was a pity that I couldn’t be with Physis, but I thought it went well.\nBecause my awakened mind started to have strange thoughts.\nI wondered if I would even be able to face him properly. I was not supposed to be that timid…\nNow I felt the strange excitement of seeing his face and the tiredness of having to distinguish between those who were friendly and those who were hostile to me.\nPlease, I hoped this social gathering was over soon and I would go back to Rodenov with him.\nI sighed and started looking for where Physis was, and soon found him mingling with the dancing crowd.\nAt the same time, as I watched Physis happily dancing with Selina Idenea, I felt anger welling up in my heart, even though I knew it was an act.\nJealousy.\nYes. It was obviously jealousy.\n[ TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to\nread up to the 5 chapters ahead\nof the release: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007]",

      "content": "53 – Awareness and Jealousy (2)\n[Adilun's POV]\nFor the first time, I felt a surge of jealousy that ignited a fiery feeling in my heart.\nAs much as I wanted to lash out at Selina and grabbed her hair, I knew I couldn't do it.\nIf I acted that way, Physis would only get in more trouble.\nMoreover, the acting we had been doing at best would also be turned into nothing. So I calmed down as much as I could while holding on to the last shred of reason.\nHowever, since it was all my plan so I had no choice but to endure it, but my expression was gradually frowning.\nThe fortunate thing was that she couldn't say anything about whether I frowned or not because I staged a big fight with him yesterday.\nAs I struggled to contain my jealousy, I noticed Selina whispering something to Physis.\nSeeing how friendly they looked, I almost exploded in anger again, but I managed to hold it back.\nHowever, the situation did not end there.\nAs if there was honey applied to Physis’ body, she continued to cling to Physis’ side, with a feverish expression on her face.\nI wouldn't be able to hold back my anger if I saw more, so I turned my head away. The fact that I had to watch this all day made me extremely sad and angry.\n'Idiot. Why don’t you suggest something like this?'\nIf I hadn’t asked him to act like that, the person next to him would have been me.\nAround the time I was so discouraged, I started to hear someone’s voice in my head.\n– Adilun? Are you okay?\nIt was Physis’ voice.\n'What?'\nI looked around in surprise, and my eyes met Physis, who was dancing with Selina. He kept looking at me without realizing it.\nHis eyes softened momentarily, and I began to hear his voice in my head.\n-That’s right. You don’t have to look around like that. I did it just in case... but fortunately, it worked.\n'Mind magic? No, that can't be because Physis doesn’t know magic, right?'\nPhysis was a knight who had awakened mana, so it might be that he conveyed his thoughts to me in a different way that I didn't know.\nEither way, it was a relief.\nSince Physis was the one who noticed my condition first, I saw no reason not to share my thoughts with him. So, I conveyed my thoughts to him.\n- Physis?\n-Yes.\n– How did you use Mindmagic?\n-I had recently learned it. And I was just using it today… …By the way, you look so bad, is there anything wrong? You've been acting strange since yesterday.\n– Oh, nothing. It’s just that the banquet hall is a bit uncomfortable. What about you? Did you get anything?\n-I didn’t get anything else… … This woman in front of me is quite annoying. She has been bothering me since yesterday. I want to step away from her right now.\nLittle by little, my pent-up anger and momentary fire began to dissipate.\n-Does Selina Idenea bother you that much?\n-Yes. She keeps talking about things I’m not interested in, and she keeps trying to bring out gossip about you, Adilun. And also, I've been keeping the magic tool with the recording function you gave me earlier.\n-Good job. But if it's too bothersome, it's okay to slowly distance yourself. You already danced with her once, right?\n-That's true too. But... I want to take a look at the influential princesses around me, but I can't seem to do it.\n-Are you saying you’re going to lay your hands on another princess in front of me?\n– Oh no! It just wants to make sure that no one is against you!\nI deliberately sent him a joke, but he shouted at me as if he was very embarrassed.\n– Hehehe. I was just joking. Hehe... But Physis.\n-Yes?\n-Thank you for your concern. And I’ll take Selina Idenea off for you.\n-What?\nI stopped talking to him and turned my head to see Selina smiling as she spoke to Physis after the dance.\n'Yes. Since Physis said he was annoyed, I have to take care of it myself.'\n'Shouldn’t I do that much for him, who is suffering for me?'\nI immediately turned to Selina, forcing my face, which had been slightly loosened because of him, to harden again.\nThen there was a bewildered noise around me.\nMaybe they wondered if I would hit Physis on the cheek again today. No. It won’t happen. I just wanted to talk to Selina a bit.\nLittle by little, the distance between Selina and me got closer, and finally, when I arrived in front of Physis and Selina.\nPhysis looked at me with a slightly puzzled expression and asked.\n“What is going on here? Are you going to slap me again?”\n“No. You didn't do anything today, so you can leave. Princess Selina Idea?”\n“Ah yes?”\n“Can you talk to me for a second?”\nBut then Selina turned her gaze to Physis.\n'This bitch is like a fox. Are you beckoning Physis to stop me?'\n“Don’t just try to put Physis as a shield, and follow me when I say it nicely. I just have something I want to say.”\nShe looked at me with rather creepy eyes and bit her lip for a moment before nodding.\n“Yes.”\n* * *\n[Physis's POV]\nAfter the rather bloody confrontation between Adilun and Selina, as the two walked out of the banquet hall for a while, I began to see the princesses staring at me in earnest.\nApparently, as soon as the stumbling block called Selina disappeared, they seemed to be trying to approach me right away.\n“I… … Sir Physis. Would it be alright if we danced a song?”\nAmong them, the first to strike was a woman with light purple hair. Judging by the way she looked, I could tell that she was one of the princesses Adillun had described before.\nIsla Isvante.\nShe had a somewhat gentle impression, but it seemed like she had something to say to me.\n“Yes. Why not? By the way, I’m sorry, but I don’t know who the princess is. Could you please briefly introduce yourself?”\nJust in case, I asked her who she was. If I told her that I knew her, Isla, whom I had never met before, might find it strange.\n“Ah yes. I am… … Isla. My name is IslaIsvante.”\n“Yes. Princess Isla Isvante. May I know what caused you to ask me to dance?”\n“Ah yes. Well, I heard that you actually fought Princess Rodenov.”\nSeeing me and Adilun acting out of the blue, she brought up the story as if a little uneasy.\n“Fight? No. To be precise, I was beaten one-sidedly.”\n“I saw that scene. I think that Princess Rodenov also made a mistake. But I hope you don't think badly of her.”\n“Can you tell me why? It’s hard for me to understand if you say that right away.”\n“Ah, that… … Yesterday, I heard you talking with Princess Selina. That’s why I knew that Sir Physis was quite angry with Princess Rodenoff.”\n“Yes. therefore?”\n“But the Princess Rodenov I know wasn’t that bad. So I wonder if the Lord has any misunderstandings with Princess Rodenov…”\n“Misunderstanding? Princess Isla, have you met Adilun a lot?”\n“No. That’s not it.”\n“But then why should I believe and listen to Princess Isla? You seem to have suffered less Adilun than me right now?”\nI took her hand and turned her around gently. She stiffened a bit and said,\n“Yes. I know that I am not qualified to come out and talk like this. Still… … Princess Rodenov once rescued me from a predicament. So, I knew then that she was not someone who enjoys oppressing others and taking away their freedom. So Sir, please don’t think badly of Princess Rodenov.”\nTo be honest, if I had really fought Adilun, her words would not have been worth listening to. She couldn't just show Adilun's good side in front of me just because she had seen it before.\nBut right now, I was just pretending that I fought Adilun. So there was no need for me not to listen to her now.\nRather, she could be a rare ally among those who rejected her, so I decided to listen to her story.\n“For now… … Okay. After the dance, please tell me the details.”\n“Ah, yes.”\nShe smiled broadly as if she was happy that things were going her way.\nHowever… … For some reason, the more I looked at her, the more she seemed like an innocent princess. It wouldn’t be nice to talk like that normally. Saying that someone you hate was a good person and that it was just a simple misunderstanding, only made the other person angry.\n'Well, I was not really angry with Adilun, let’s move on…'\nIf she genuinely favored Adilun, she could be seen as her ally, so it might be better for me to be friendly with her.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to\nread up to the 5 chapters ahead\nof the release: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates, and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9]",

      "content": "54 – Awareness and Jealousy (3)\n[Adilun's POV]\n“Is there any problem, Princess Rodenov?”\nPrincess Selina was brazenly talking to me. Judging by her appearance, she seemed to have decided that her flirting with Physis was acceptable and no big deal.\n“I didn’t want to say this, but… … Aren’t you being too shameless?”\nMy tone became naturally sharper in response to her impudent attitude.\nThere was no need to be nice to someone who was flirting with an engaged person.\n“What?! What do you mean? Shameless?”\n“Aren’t you ashamed to go to such lengths with a man who has a fiancee?”\nAt my words, Princess Selina laughed as if I had said something amusing.\n“Princess Rodenov, wasn't it the princess who broke her fiancé's heart in the first place? Furthermore, Sir Physis and the Princess's engagement was only an arranged marriage... it is excruciatingly painful to suppress a person's freedom like that.”\n“Okay. It can be painful. But he chose to be engaged to me, and this is between him and me. There is no room for you to intervene.”\n“No. It’s not a matter for the princess to decide, it’s for Sir Physis to decide. Because it's his freedom that is being suppressed now.”\n“Freedom being suppressed… … . Yes, it is true that I have some control over his freedom, but this is something we agreed upon when we got engaged. He's just being childish now. He'll get over it soon.”\n“I'm a bit surprised to hear such a story from you. I've only heard that you're gentle... But you like to manipulate people.”\nWho to say? I didn't think she, who shook many people out of her grasp because she always wanted to be the main character, would say that.\n“I find it funny that you're saying such things, considering you've replaced many of your previous partners from prestigious families. Aren't you using them to make yourself stand out? At least I'm more conscientious than you, who has done it to so many people.”\nI said with a soft smile on my face. I thought it was ridiculous that a slut woman like her would say such things to me, just to make herself stand out.\n“Ha, what? All that people dated me by their own choice. It’s a situation no different from yours.”\nSelina couldn't have been more absurd. Because I had never shown this kind of attitude before, it seemed to catch her off guard. She couldn't help but feel embarrassed that I, who always pretended to be indifferent even when I heard behind-the-scenes gossip about me, was now being so aggressive.\n“It is no different from me… … Ahahaha. That’s funny. At least I’ve never opened my legs to others to be the main character. This is it, even a prostitute on the street is cleaner than you. Did you really want to be the main character? ....The reputation and attitude you have now earned among princesses... Do you think I don’t know that all of that comes from nobles son clinging to you rather than from your own strength?”\nSelina's face turned red with anger as if my words had struck a sensitive spot in her.\nAfter all, it was easy to provoke someone with an inferiority complex.\n“You speak vulgarly. Now let me speak bluntly. It's not that Princess Rodenov never slept around; it's that she couldn't. Perhaps no one paid attention to you because of your unsightly scales.”\n“Well. Yes, it made me look a little gross.”\nI nodded my head obediently at her words. I had no intention of denying it. I couldn’t see my scaly figure as a human being. Moreover, there was no need to be angry with her words.\nBecause now, my appearance was no longer as gross as before.\n“But that is in the past. Look at me now. Who in the world would say that I am gross?”\nI deliberately smiled brightly at Selina and said, in order to provoke her inferiority complex.\n“So I don’t have to worry too much about being the main character like you. I will be above you no matter what.”\n“You are overconfident. Do you really think you can say that when your fiancé is taken away from you? I think Lord Physis is on the verge of coming on to me right now. After all, isn’t the reason you talked to me this way so that you don’t lose your fiancé?”\nI laughed at the sound she made as she licked her lips.\n“Yes. I don’t want my fiancé taken away. Especially for a woman like you. So I will do my best.”\n“What's the best… … Are you going to tie him up?”\n“If I need to. I will. I will do whatever it takes to keep him. I didn’t realize I had such a strong desire for exclusivity, but now I know I won’t give him up to anyone.”\n“Ha, such a person would slap her fiancé on the cheek like that. You are amazing.”\n“Well, that would seem to you. But you don’t know anything about me and Physis. On the contrary, talking to you gives me peace of mind.”\n“Yes?”\n“You can never seduce him. You can’t take him away from me because...”\nMy words were strangling Selina. Instantly, her complexion turned pale.\n“Physis is more likely to be parasitized by people like you than someone like me who cherishes him.”\nI glared at her with a sneering smile I had never shown before.\n“Because he despises you.”\n“You can’t guarantee anything, Princess Rodenov.”\nSelina tried to put on a brave face and spoke with a hint of resentment.\nI didn’t miss that moment. The corners of my mouth quivered to bluff.\nShe quickly moved her feet and headed for the banquet hall. She would tell others about my actions and make herself out to be the victim.\nBut that was also what I wanted. The wise would see through her lies, but the foolish would turn against me. There were quite a few people who looked up to Princess Selina’s outward appearance and admired her.\nBut in the North, where I would rule, I didn't need a man who could be swayed by such superficial qualities.\nIn fact, I could have easily taken her territory without causing a scene. Her rude treatment of me gave me a perfect excuse.\nBut I was reluctant to approach everything in that way. Using my background when necessary was good, but if I relied solely on it, I could end up being perceived as terrible.\nMore than anything, I wanted to make Selina despair by gradually realizing her own reality, instead of succumbing to physical despair through the Battle of the Territory, the great duel.\nThe reality was that she would never be able to catch up with me no matter what she did.\nWhen I came to that thought, I suddenly realized that I had changed a lot.\nWhen I was greedy for someone, I tended to be like this. However, lately, I hadn't desired much. If I truly wanted something, I could be as greedy as anyone else.\nThat realization made me even more happier.\nI headed back to the banquet hall with slow, leisurely steps.\n* * *\n[Physis's POV]\nAfter the dance with Isla was over, Selina returned to the banquet hall with a slightly reddened face.\n'Did she hear anything from Adilun? Her expression is pretty grim.'\n'Well, I don’t have to worry about it. Adilun must have done well.'\nI looked at Isla and said.\n“Princess Isla.”\n“Yes. Sir Physis.”\n“Could you tell me the story you just talked about in detail? The story of how Adiun helped you. I can’t believe it. I’ve only seen the violent side of her.”\n“Ahh! Yes. of course. Shall we go over there and talk? It’s uncomfortable when there are other princesses… … ”\nWhether she was a bit shy or if something bad happened with the other princesses, she wanted to distance herself from them. I obediently followed her opinion.\n“Alright. I wonder what kind of story you are gonna tell me.”\nAnd at the same time, I saw Adilun, who looked relieved and happy, returned to the banquet hall. It seemed that things had worked out pretty well.\n-Physis? The woman in front… … uh? Is she Princess Isla?\n– Do you know her?\n-Yes. She’s a princess I’ve helped before, but since she hasn’t been around recently, I didn’t think she’d come to this social gathering. So, I only told you how she look and didn’t tell you the details, but what happened?\n-Well, it looks like she heard gossip about you, and now she’s trying to tell me the story of how you helped her… Would you like to hear?\n-Uh, that’s a bit embarrassing… … Still, I’d like to hear it. If Princess Isla sincerely says something good about me, it means that she is my ally.\n-Alright. Ah, but what did you talk about with Princess Selina? Her face was very crumpled.\n-Aha, I did say many things... But I don’t want to tell you much. It was because there were some harsh words.\n– Then there’s nothing I can do about it. Okay.\nI nodded, stopped the conversation with Adilun, and looked at Isla.\n“Please begin, Princess Isla.”\n“Ah yes!”\nThat was how Isla began to tell the story between Adilun and herself.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to\nread up to the 5 chapters ahead\nof the release: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007\nJoin Our Discord for regular updates, and have fun with other community members: invite/SqWtJpPtm9]",

      "content": "55 – Ugh?\n[Isla's pov]\nIsla Isvante was an introverted and timid girl. Because of her shy nature, she did not easily get along with others, and as a result, she maintained an attitude of stepping back from the princesses.\nMoreover, since she was not the type to enjoy walking around outside, her taste was extremely static, and in the end, she had to dwell on the bitterness alone when she went to a banquet without making contact with any princess.\nIn truth, she also wanted to make friends, but her shyness and difficulty speaking in social situations only served to further isolate her.\nBut there was no problem. She didn’t associate with others often, so she was out of public attention.\nIn the first place, she did not get involved with others, so she did not get involved in various incidents or accidents.\nHowever, her somewhat peaceful but lonely situation changes.\nThat was, on the day Isla first set foot in the social world, a male aristocrat who had a crush on Isla appeared.\nIsla was naive and timid, but at least she knew how to be considerate of others. The male aristocrat, who was attracted by that, was in a situation where, of course, he already had a fiancée.\nWhat followed was obvious.\nIsla didn’t have much interest in the male aristocrat and rather rejected him out of fear, but the male aristocrat did not yield to her and continued to court Isla.\nHowever, the fiancée of the male aristocrat, who was displeased with that, began to harass Isla, and eventually, the somewhat influential fiancée mobilized her close friends to vent her low feelings toward Isla.\nEven if it seemed like no big deal to someone, it was a terrible day for Isla. To the point where she hated getting involved with people.\nShe didn’t want to go to the banquet even more now, and she hated meeting with anyone. It made her afraid of people.\nIt was then that Isla met Adilun.\nIt was Adilun birthday banquet. Isvante, a minor noble in the north, had no choice but to attend her birthday banquet, and Isla met Adilun for the first time there.\nAlthough others loathe and fear her scaly appearance, she had stood tall and behaved befitting a successor to Rodenov.\nIsla was not afraid of Adilun’s appearance and felt that her proud behavior was great.\nUnfortunately for Isla, most of the northern nobles had already attended Afilun's birthday banquet, and of course, those who had been bothering her were also present.\nThose who bullied Isla outside of everyone’s eyes once again called her separately and harassed her. She couldn’t even ask anyone for help, because she was a descendant of a powerless aristocratic family.\nThe aristocratic man who first wooed her turned his attention to another woman as if he had lost interest in her, but his fiancée still harassed Isla.\nThe bullying that started with anger as the driving force now had become a habit.\nJust as she was serving as an outlet for the emotions of the princesses in the garden, Adilun appeared in front of her.\nAdilun couldn’t accept that someone would bully others at her birthday banquet.\nShe responded immediately. She hid Isla behind herself, kicked out the male aristocratic fiancée and the people who followed her and harassed Isla at the banquet, she also threatened them that if they touched Isla in the future, it would be regarded as touching Rodenov.\nOnly then was Isla freed from them, and she tried to say thank you to Adilun.\nHowever, Isla, who was timid, ended up saying thank you and running away, so she missed the opportunity to make her first friend.\nWith that memory at that time, she decided that she shouldn’t live like this, and tried to change herself little by little. Beginning with the practice of talking to the maids of the family first, a tearful effort was made over the years.\nAnd finally, at this point, Isla, who had shed her timidity, attended this social gathering to thank Adilun for saving her and to ask if she could be a friend with her.\n* * *\n[Physis's POV]\nIt was a story that was sure to happen somewhere, but I nodded my head because Isla's attitude in telling the story was quite serious.\nIndeed. I wondered how such a timid person could talk to me, but was there a steady effort?\n“I guess that happened.”\n“Yes, yes. Princess Rodenov is a really nice person.”\n“But isn’t it different now? What year did you say it was then?”\n“It was three years ago.”\n“It is impossible to say that Adilun then and Adilun now are the same. Isn’t it? Haven’t you ever thought that as much as you have changed, Adilun must have changed too?”\n“That, that… …”\nIsla couldn’t answer easily. And I kept pushing her.\n“Perhaps now Adilun is not what you know. She suppressed me and even slapped me on the cheek, as you saw yesterday. Would such a person really remember Princess Isla?”\n“… …”\nIsla thought about it, then shook her head.\n“No. She probably doesn’t remember.”\nI said. I wanted to be honest, but I kept quiet because I had a duty to see Isla's reaction.\n“But it doesn’t matter. Because I came here to become friends with Princess Rodenov in the first place.”\nI could be sure by looking into her determined eyes.\nThat this girl really wanted to get to know Adilun.\nSo I nodded and said.\n“Do as you please. Of course, don’t think that I will change my mind about Adilun.”\n“… … Yes. Actually, I didn’t think Sir Physis would change his mind. It’s only natural because you were even slapped on the cheek by Princess Rodenov. But I just wanted to tell you that she is not such a bad person. Then I’ll go see Princess Rodenov.”\n“Yes.”\nI nodded nonchalantly, but inside I was happy.\nIt was because I could tell without looking that Adilun would be happy in her room at night.\nCome to think of it, I remember that Princess Lobelia also said that she would become Adilun’s friend, but since National Foundation Day, we haven’t had anything to meet… …It must be good for her just to have a friend who will be nearby right now.\nAbove all, Princess Lobelia was a little ambiguous to be a mere friend.\nThe relationship of being a pure friend without any intention was a law that gave people strength.\nAt this social gathering, I thought I would find a lot of people to weed out, but I never thought there would be such an unexpected harvest.\nI looked at Isla as she walked towards Adilun. Isla looked at Adilun and was delighted to say thank you for helping her before, finally began able to say it.\nAdilun treated her in a perplexed manner, perhaps unfamiliar with her friendly attitude, and then nodded happily when she cautiously asked if it was okay to be her friend.\nBy the time they were building friendships with each other, I was gradually grasping the inner thoughts of the nobles approaching me, and today’s banquet was finally over.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nAt the end of the banquet, I talk to Adilun.\n– Adilun.\n-Yes?\n– Yesterday, Adilun came to my room, so can I come over today? I felt like I had to tell you about a noble who figured out his intentions today.\n-Uh, yes? Yes. Please. But how would you come?\n-I’m good at hiding or infiltrating. I’ll see if the time is right later and I’ll find it through the window.\n-If so… … okay.\nAs soon as Adilun gave permission, I went straight to my room, washed briefly, opened the window of my room, and started climbing the outer wall of the castle while changing into slightly simpler clothes.\nSince most of the structure of the castle and rooms were already known, finding Adilun's room was not difficult. It wasn’t even that far from my room in the first place.\nSince it was already late at night, no one was looking at the castle, so I was able to reach Adilun’s room smoothly.\nAdilun had the window of the terrace wide open, probably expecting me to come. I jumped right into it.\n“Adilun.”\nI called her name softly from the terrace.\nHowever, when I didn’t hear Adilun's answer, I went straight into her room, wondering if something serious had happened.\nThere was no one in the room.\n'Did she didn't expect me to come this early?'\nJust as I raised my voice and tried to find her, the door to the bathroom suddenly opened… … I saw Adilun wrapped in a towel.\n“Uh?”\n“Ah?”\nWe were frozen to each other, unable to say anything.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL: Join Patreon to support the translation and to\nread up to the 5 chapters ahead\nof the release: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007]",

      "content": "[Physis' POV]\n“Ahhhhh… …”\nIn my field of vision, Adilun was completely frozen. Looking at me she was just clenched her hand wrapped in the towel. Her trembling pupils showed how flustered she was now.\nShe didn’t even think about closing the bathroom door and appeared to be in complete panic.\nI immediately tried to look away, but I couldn’t take my eyes off her, as if I was in an irresistible fascination.\nAfter coming out of the bath, her slightly flushed and immaculate skin caught my attention first. Unlike the slightly heated skin around her shoulders, her red-hot face was so lovely, and her wet hair seduced me more fatally than any other charm.\nMy heart was beating wildly to the point where I couldn't control it, but I somehow endured it with everything thing I have and turned my head. I knew that I could never forgive myself if I did anything inappropriate to Adilun at that moment.\n“I-I’m sorry!”\n“...”\nPerhaps coming to her senses from my hasty apology, Adilun quickly snapped back and went back into the bathroom, slamming the door shut.\n“Adilun...?”\n“Yes... Yes.”\n“I’m sorry! Really, it wasn’t something I intended to do.”\n“Okay, it’s okay. But I’m also very confused… … Physis?”\n“Yes!”\n“Could you please give me my clothes… …I mean can you bring them?”\n“What do you mean clothes?... I-I mean what clothes are you talking about?”\n“That, the thin clothes that I wear to sleep. They should be on the bed. Could you please bring them to me?”\n“Alright, Sure.”\nWhen I moved my stiff body and looked at her bed, there was a thin nightdress.\nI picked up the nightdress and headed towards the bathroom, where Adilun was waiting. Oddly enough, I felt my body stiffen.\nI knocked on the bathroom door.\n“Adilun? I brought your pajamas.”\n“Ah yes.”\nThe door opened, and she quickly took the nightdress from my hand, holding out her arm, still wrapped in a towel.\nAnd the door closes again.\nI sat down on the couch in her room, exhausted.\nThe image of Adilun I had seen earlier lingered in my mind, and perhaps because of that, I felt that my body was not under my control.\nI knew that I had to be careful, or else I might act on my impulses. I decided to stick to the main topic for the day and leave her room as soon as possible.\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\nThe heat spread throughout my body, leaving me feeling bewildered.\nI had anticipated his arrival, hence why I left the terrace door open, but I had not expected him to come so soon.\nA mix of embarrassment and shame ran through my body, causing my body to stiffen as I struggle to figure out what to do next.\nThe heat on top of my head was so intense that I threw off the towel I wrapped around my body and pour cold water over my body.\nA splash of cold water at least got things working, so I wrapped myself back in a towel and asked Physis to get my pajamas.\nAfter swiftly snatching my pajamas from his hand exposed through the crack in the door, I quickly put on my pajamas and opened the bathroom door.\nAs I walked out of the bathroom with a somewhat awkward gait. I saw Physis sitting on the sofa in my room, closing his eyes as if meditating.\n“Ah, Physis?”\n“Oh, Adilun. You are done.”\n“Yes.”\nWith that, the conversation ended. An inconceivable awkwardness lingered between us.\nTo be honest, I didn’t know what to say in this situation.\nI was sure there were people who didn't consider it a big deal to show their bodies to their fiancé. But that was only true in very close betrothal relationships.\nThere was no choice but to be different from those who fell in love from the beginning and became engaged.\nPhysis and I were just getting to know each other, and I was just starting to feel affection for him, so it was all too sudden.\n“I… …”\n“Yes… …”\n“Ah. Mmm, you tell me first...”\n“These are the contents recorded today. I think that they'll probably be of great help to you, Adilun.”\nSaying that, Physis handed over the magic tool to me.\nI nodded my head with a slightly stiff gesture.\n“Thanks. I will check this separately later.”\nAnd again there was an awkward silence.\n'What am I supposed to say? What can I do to get past this situation casually?'\n“Adilun, sorry. I didn't know you were taking a bath… …”\nPhysis handed me an apology with a serious expression as if he had made up his mind to apologize.\nAt that, I waved my hand and told him.\n“Oh no! it’s okay. Yes really. It was unavoidable... It was something that no one should have noticed… … So it’s okay.”\n“still… …”\n“You don’t have to be like this. And you even apologized right away.”\n“uh… …”\n“Hmm... and we are in an engagement relationship anyway. So it’s okay.”\nI started talking gibberish to the point where I couldn’t tell what the hell I was even talking about.\n'What the heck I was just spat out!?'\nRealizing that I immediately covered my mouth as if I had made a mistake.\nBut my word seemed to do something in Physis.\n“It’s an engagement relationship, so it’s okay?”\nPhysis's eyes suddenly flashed dangerously, as if his rationality was slipping. I realized that I had answered something wrong.\nSuddenly he grabbed my wrist violently. A slight pain rose in the side of my wrist, and my expression frowned.\n“If I were to do this, would you still say it was okay?”\n“… …That’s… …”\nI couldn’t say anything If I gave the wrong answer here, I thought it would go a long way. An inner conflict crept into me.\nI didn't know if he likes me or not.\nJudging by the look in his eyes now… … He was clearly craving me now. Those slightly unrestrained eyes were eyes that I had never seen from him before.\nHonestly, I was glad he liked me. It made me feel like a woman with charm.\nHowever... The problem was that I couldn’t tell if he was simply physically or mentally lusting after me.\nI didn't want him to lust after me just for my physical appearance.\nI hated it. I wanted him to love and respect me for who I was.\nWe were finally able to look forward, having washed away our hatred and contempt for each other, and in the process, I felt like I had fallen in love with him all too soon.\nIt wasn’t something I hated. Because liking and being able to love someone meant that I was a normal person. It means that I had enough room in me to hold someone in my heart.\nEver since I realized I liked him, a pleasant thrill always stayed in my heart. Of course, this pleasant excitement became an unbearable flame when he danced with another woman or had a friendly conversation, but I still wanted to hold this excitement.\nI hoped he also got as excited to see me as I feel. It was not just because I was a fiancée tied to an arranged marriage, but I wanted him to desire me mentally as much as he does physically.\nTherefore... ...Not right now. I hoped there was at least some chance that he loves me. If that was confirmed, I would be able to surrender myself to him without hesitation.\nPerhaps he interpreted my long silence as negative due to his worries, he removed his hand from my wrist and immediately apologized.\n“I’m sorry for behaving violently. But I needed to say this, Adilune.”\n“… …What?”\nI felt a slight sense of disappointment welling up inside me.\nI decided to accept that disappointment as well. This disappointment must be proof that I liked him that much.\n“Please don’t just say it’s okay. Because your body is precious. When you don't want something, I want you to shake your head and say no. I'm an idiot, so it's really hard for me to understand people's feelings. I might cross the line if you don't deny it. And that... will hurt both of us.”\nHe gently stroked the wrist he was holding, which began to tingle. The pain disappeared as if washed away, and strange shame and heat began to fill its place.\n\"Anyway, I'd like to talk more, but I don't think I can. I'm sorry, Adilun. Rest well.\"\nI nodded. I knew that too. Now, if we dragged out more time here, we would definitely cross the line.\nHe slipped out of my room through the door on the open terrace.\nI watched him quietly, and he climbed the wall with mysterious movements, and then went back to his room.\nLeft alone, I could only sigh.\nWith obvious regret… … It was such a sigh.\nUnbeknownst to me, I must have hoped that he would covet me.\nA heat that wouldn't go away even with cold water began to spread throughout my body.\nThe fact that he wanted me... ...overjoyed me. The heat in my body became so strong that I began to shiver.\nI probably won't be able to fall asleep easily tonight.\nIf, after the deadline, when I first ask him… … Is he and I in love?'\nPlease, I just hope so...\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "57 – Alcohol\n[Physis's POV]\nI didn't know what came over me. After leaving Adilun's room and returning to my own, I grabbed my head with my hand and squeezed it tightly.\n'Crazy. What crazy thing I just did.'\nNormal people wouldn't grab someone's wrist tightly and asked if it was okay to attack them.\nIf I hadn't calmed my mind with extreme patience, I would have already attacked Adilun. And our relationship would have been ruined.\nI was glad I was able to hold back.\nI already love her deeply, so if she looked at me with contemptuous eyes again, I couldn't have endured it any longer.\nIn my head, I kept picturing Adilun coming out of the bath with her reddened shoulders and face.\nThe sight of her wet hair slightly clinging to her skin was even more alluring than usual… …Captivated by that enchanting figure, I had no choice but to keep following it in my head.\nIf anyone saw me, they would have no words for my lewd and obscene behavior. I was ashamed to face Adilun.\nAfter barely calming down my agitated mind and body, I began to think about tomorrow's schedule. Since the tea time of the princesses was scheduled, the men would have no choice but to play around.\nSo there was no need for me to go out. If I encountered anyone casting dirty eyes toward Adilun, there would be another accident.\nAnyway, I had shown my face enough at the social gathering, and since I could mostly grasp what the female nobles thought of Adilun, I had no intention of getting involved with them for the time being.\nI would just lock myself in my room with the excuse that I wasn’t feeling well… … And as soon as Adilun’s tea time was over, I would go into her room and confess my sins.\nAfter organizing my thoughts, a mental blankness came over me.\n'I should just go to sleep. If I think too much about Adilun again, there was a high chance that the lie of not feeling well would become the truth.'\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\nLast night, I couldn’t sleep properly because I kept tossing and turning, so I participated in tea time with a hazy mind.\nSelina Idenea, who had been manipulating Physis, began to stare at me with an annoyed expression, and I also glared back at her with a displeased expression.\nThe atmosphere of tea time was not very pleasant because of me and her.\nI just quietly watched the flow of conversation during tea time with sharp eyes, and as I continued to sit in my seat, the princesses began to cautiously watch me.\nEven with a hazy mind last night, I was able to determine which princess was friendly to me and which ones were not, thanks to the magic tool Physis gave me.\nHowever, it would be better to save that information for later instead of revealing it now.\nLast night was honestly a series of embarrassing incidents.\nI acted irrationally toward Selina Idenea, and I regretted that I couldn't have been more rational at the time and dealt a bigger blow to her.\nWhile it was inevitable that I got hot-headed due to Physis constantly pushing my limits, at the very least, I should have maintained a rational attitude in that situation.\nThere won't be another incident like last time in the future.\nThe tea time eventually ended on an uncomfortable note, although I didn't feel that I had intentionally created that atmosphere.\nI did not say anything to them, but gave them a warning, scanning them with my sharp eyes.\n'Don't go against my intentions.'\nIt was the Rodenov who still had the greatest power in the north, and they could not escape its influence.\nAs the emperor was swayed by the prime minister, local nobles who were supposed to swear allegiance to the emperor eventually chose to pay taxes among themselves.\nSo was Ortaire in the east, and so was Rodenov in the north.\nIt would have been unimaginable if the emperor was in good health… …But for some reason, the emperor did not show any interest in the local nobles raising their troops and taxes. He was only busy with pleasure in the center.\n'What does the emperor really want? Why did he ruin his decades-long reign so futilely?'\nThese were the questions swirling in my head, but I pushed them aside.\nIt wasn't the time to look in that direction, and stabilizing the internal affairs was urgent. I raised my teacup and took a sip, then spoke for the first time since joining the tea time.\n\"I'll take my leave now. I'm not feeling well today.\"\n\"Ah, is that so?\"\n\"Yes. There's no need for anyone else to get up. I'll see you tomorrow then.\"\n“Rest well, Princess Rodenov.”\nThe princesses who saw me off began to smile. After all, I had been making the atmosphere heavy, so it must have been uncomfortable to carry on with the conversations.\nMoreover, I wasn't sure where their interests were currently directed. If I disappeared, they would undoubtedly start telling stories about Physis.\nIt wasn't just because I had fallen in love with him... This was because Physis was an excellent husband-to-be for any princess in Enadeim.\nHis physical strength was good, and his appearance was handsome. Besides, he wasn’t as violent or rude as before.\nEven the family of Ortaire had the most influence in the East. So which princess would reject such a person?\nJust thinking about it made me irritated, but I forced myself to suppress that annoyance. They were like fawning cats.\nOf course, not all the princesses were like that. Some were undoubtedly disappointed that I was leaving, including Isla and the princesses around her.\nI wondered what aspect of me they admired. Well, I could invite them to Rodenov later to find out.\nNow that I had shed my scales, I could have normal interactions with other princesses.\nExhausted with thoughts, I immediately returned to my room and threw myself on the bed. As I lay down on the bed, thoughts of Physis began to invade my mind.\nMy recent thought patterns had always been the same: Physis, Physis, Physis.\nEspecially since I became aware of my own feelings, it had gotten worse... ...I felt like I had become a fool.\nBut it wasn't that I didn't like it. Being able to pour my heart out to someone was very exciting.\nCome to think of it, what was Physis doing right now? There were rumors that the men were gathering separately and had a drinking party… … Was he drinking too?\nWhen I thought of alcohol, I remembered the embarrassing sight I showed him, and heat rushed to my face.\nBut when I think back to that moment...I remembered him treating me very kindly.\nI was definitely held in his arms and looked at the stars.\nThe stars that embroidered the sky were so beautiful, and even though I couldn't say it to him, it felt like the stars were falling in the winter garden...so I asked him to dance.\n'Alcohol...'\nIf I drank alcohol again, would he be nice to me again? Would he understand if I forcefully closed the distance with him?\nIt was impossible to know, but it was worth testing.\n'Yes. Let’s have a drink.'\n'Maybe, just maybe...'\nI might be able to tell him my honest feelings, and he might also tell me his own honest feelings.\nI grabbed the wine in my room...and just like that, I drank it all in one go.\nThe hot and sweet alcohol flowed down my throat, and the heat gradually spread throughout my body. It felt like a fire was burning inside me, and my vision began to waver.\nThe proper line was important. I had planned to secretly visit his room. I had to keep a minimal amount of rationality to use the transparency magic to find his room.\nAround the time the shaking of my vision got worse, I immediately cast the invisibility magic and went straight to Physis’s room.\nI was able to arrive at his room by the time my rationality, which had been shaking little by little, gradually collapsed completely. My vision gradually spun around, and a smile began to spread across my lips.\nConfirming that there was no one in the hallway, I cautiously opened Physis’s door hoping that he would be inside.\nFortunately, Physis was inside. It seemed that he didn’t like being involved with nobles for nothing.\n“Adilun?”\nI hear his low, alluring voice. Enchanted by his pleasant voice, I immediately released the transparency spell... and gave in to the impulse that was urging me from within.\nSo I ran to him and hugged him tightly.\n“Uh, huh? Adilun? Why? Did the princesses say anything nonsense to you?”\nI liked his perplexed tone. I was glad that he was worried about what had happened to me. I emptied my thoughts and surrendered to my instincts.\n* * *\n[Physis' POV]\nI couldn’t help but be surprised. Suddenly, Adliun came to my room, and before long I was hugged by her.\nAs I was confused about what was going on, the sweet aroma of wine emanated from her body.\n“Hehe, Physis, Physis.”\nShe hugged me tightly and started calling my name over and over again.\n\"Alcohol? Adilun. Did you drink alcohol?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n“Why, why? Did the princesses say anything nonsense to you?”\n“Oh, no. I just… … thought about the last time I drank… … I drink im-impulsively.”\nHer tongue twisted suddenly as she uttered the final words.\nIt seemed like she was slowly letting go of the strings of reason, so I felt a headache for no reason.\nWhy was Adilun suddenly like this? Surely she must have had some difficult emotional issues. So she probably borrowed the power of alcohol... She must have come to me because she remembers the last time I pampered her. Perhaps she came to vent her frustrations comfortably.\nI decided to just think that way. There was no way she came to see me just because she wanted to.\n\"It's one thing to drink alcohol, but why did you come to see me?\"\n\"Can't I come to see you?\"\n\"No, it's not that you can't... but there must be a reason, right?\"\n“I came to see you!”\nSeeing her smiling broadly at me, the thoughts I had just before were shattered in an instant.\nDid I hear her correctly? She came to see me because she wanted to? No way.\nShe pulled me closer and looked up at me, holding me tighter.\nA reddish face and loose golden eyes. My heart started beating fast at the same appearance as last time. Even though something happened between us yesterday, was she doing this because I gave her my trust?\n“Can I complain to you?”\n“Complain?”\n“Yes, complain.”\n\"Sure, go ahead. We have plenty of time today anyway.\"\n\"Hehe. Then... ...let's start with that damn bi*ch Selena.\"\n“Yes?”\nI doubted my ears for a moment. It was because unbelievably extreme words came out of her mouth.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "58 – Dreams and confessions\n[Adilun's POV]\nThe words that came out of my mouth were vulgar insults directed toward Selina.\nI hated Selina. I hated that woman flirting with him. I hated the other princesses who tried to talk to him... I just hated every woman who approached him.\nThe one who hurt me. The one who insulted me. The one who crushed my self-esteem to the bottom and made me a coward...\nWas now suddenly became the person who healed my wounds, rebuilt my self-esteem, and devoted themselves to me.\nHe always took care of me even when I was sick with a cold and never complained once. Unlike other people who gave ugly glances as soon as my appearance changed, he was worried about me.\nAt first, I despised him and hated him.\nBut now I knew. I liked him.\n'I like you Physis...'\nWith that thought in mind, I fell into his arms.\nBut it didn't smell like him. It was different. The refreshing and cool… … scent that I always felt from him, was not there.\nMy vision was blurry, and it felt like I was dreaming.\nMaybe this wasn't reality. Maybe I was just drunk and delusional, imagining that I went to his room.\nYes. It must be true. Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to hug him like this. Yes, this must be a dream.\nSo... I want to say it. That I hate the people who flirt with you. That I feel jealous when I see those people fawn over you. And... that I like you.\nI opened my mouth.\n* * *\n[Physis' POV]\n“Damn b*tch.” Adilun said, pointing towards Selina.\n“Damn b*tch… who?”\n“That one goddamn b*tch, Selina. In the past, every time we met, she would talk about how disgusting my scales were”\nAdilun endlessly vented her dissatisfaction with Selina to me. It seemed that there had been a lot of frustration built-up in her.\n“Yes, she's a really bad woman. That one...”\nEvery time she spoke, I agreed with her words and told her that Selina was indeed a bad woman. From Adilun's perspective, Selina was truly a bad woman.\n“Right? right?”\nPerhaps she was happy that I agreed with her, she smiled and burrowed deeper into my arms. Adilun probably wasn’t such a childish person, but in many ways, she seemed to be under a lot of stress lately.\n“Yes.”\nIt would have been adorable to see her like this under normal circumstances, but it was a pity that it would not be true. A person who was not originally like this became even cuter when they acted like a child.\n“On top of that, she even wags her tail at you whenever she has a chance! I really hate her!”\nWhat was this again? Of course, it was true that Selina had intentionally tried to seduce me. But I had no idea that Adilun dislike that.\n“You don’t like Selina flirting with me?”\n“Yes. I hate it when she flirts with you and dances with you for no reason.”\n“Adilun doesn’t like me dancing with another princess?”\n“Yes, I hate it. It hurts my heart...”\nAdilun shook her head and looked up at me.\n“I hate it when you dance with other girls. I hate it when you smile at other girls. It hurts my heart to see you like that… … .”\n“Is that jealousy?”\n“Jealousy...yes. I'm jealous. It's unbearable to see other women vying for your attention...That's why I didn't want to participate in the party. I wanted to dance with you and be by your side.”\nAt the words she said while looking at me with hazy eyes, my heart started beating like crazy.\nIn other words, Adilun had clearly started to treat me as a man, and not just any man, but a man she was attracted to. For a moment, joy filled my heart.\nI had a crush on her, and she was so kind to me. I couldn’t believe it for a moment, so I asked Adilun.\n“That’s… … Does that mean you like me?”\n“Likes… …Yes. I like you.”\nHeat rushed to my head at her open confession. Even without looking at it, I could guess what my face was like right now. It would be red and ripped as if it had never been like that before.\nIn response to her bold confession, I also wanted to say that I liked her.\n“… …”\nBut my mouth didn’t open. Even though I was able to say embarrassing things in front of her, I couldn’t say the simple word that I really liked her.\nWhen I couldn't say anything, she made a sullen face.\n\"Originally... I didn't want to fall for you. But ever since I caught a cold, the way you took care of me every day, the way you treated me kindly every day, kept catching my eye, and eventually, I found myself pursuing you.\"\nShe said as if dreaming in her sullen expression. Looking at it, I realized.\nAt some point, Adilun had mistaken reality for a dream. That was why she could confess to me so boldly.\n\"So please answer me... Do you... Do you like me?\"\nIf she believed this was a dream, maybe I could answer. Even though I once insulted her and shattered her self-esteem, maybe I could confess to her.\nGuilt and various emotions overwhelmed me, and confusion engulfed me.\n“This… … Is it a dream?”\nI asked her for the final confirmation. Did she think this situation was a dream?\n“… …I don’t know. But it seems like a dream. Because there is no way that I in real life could act so possessively toward you. So it must be a dream. A dream that would gradually fade in my head when I woke up, and I won’t even remember it if I don’t try to recall it. So I guess I can say I like you. Even if it’s a dream, it’s fine, so please answer me. Do you like me?”\nIn an instant, the dream I had before passed by. I didn't know anything about her, how dare I could say I liked her.\n'If I say I like her, can I continue to avoid hurting her?'\n'I'm not sure. Will I be able to make Adilun happy?'\n'I don't know.'\nBut one thing... was certain\nThat I already loved her.\nI pushed away distracting thoughts from my mind and decided to focus on my momentary feelings.\n“No. I don't like you.”\nHer expression instantly turned into despair.\n“Ah… …”\nHer despair was even greater than when she was insulted directly by me. However, her despair disappeared as if washed away by my following words.\n“I Love You. Adilun Rodenov.”\n“Ah? What did you just say now… …”\n“I love you. I just don’t like you. I want to be with you, and I want to be by your side. When other guys look at you with dirty eyes, I want to dig them out… … I love you.”\n“This… … Is it a dream?”\n“Yes. It’s a dream. Physis in reality is a coward, so he can’t say such things.”\nI deliberately said that this situation was a dream because I was still not sure about myself.\nI could only confidently say I love her but I was sure that I won't hurt her.\n\"I'm fine with it being a dream. Just hearing that you love me is the best dream I've ever had in my life. So... ...I'll give you a gift.\"\n“Gift?”\n“Yes. A gift.”\nThen suddenly, she grabbed my collar and started getting closer. Her face approached mine. The scent of wine she had drunk was transmitted from her mouth, and the joy that couldn't be hidden was revealed in her dreamy eyes.\nAnd the next moment...\nA soft sensation touched my lips. A fiery heat spread from the spot where it touched. Our lips met in a gentle kiss.\nBut just as if she didn’t want to stop there, she started sending her tongue between my lips. I couldn't stand it either… …I entwined my tongue with hers.\nI caressed her gums, mixed our tongues again, and surrendered to the ecstasy.\nAll sorts of thoughts existed in my head, but the electrifying and ecstatic kiss wiped them away in an instant. Even I felt like this situation was a dream rather than a reality.\nWe entangled our tongues and gently kissed for a while.\nFinally, her tongue, as if reluctantly, withdrew and an iridescent transparent thread rested for a moment before dispersing... Her eyes closed.\nShe succumbed to the effects of the alcohol and fell asleep.\nI carefully picked her up. Like when she was drunk before. I couldn't bear to put her to bed in my room. If she fell asleep in my bed, I felt like I would reveal my low and shady feelings to her body.\nSo I went straight… … I looked out of the terrace, made sure no one was there, and then threw myself onto the terrace of her room. The cold night wind tried to cool off the heat that stayed in my body, but the heat did not cool down easily.\nI landed on the terrace without making any noise and fortunately confirmed that the door to the terrace was open. I slipped into it and carefully put her on the bed… … covered her with the blanket.\nAnd after looking at her sleeping for a while, I kissed her on the forehead and returned to my room.\nIt was a night when I couldn't easily fall asleep due to too many things happening inside me.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "59 – Ortaire (1)\n[Adilun's POV]\nMy mind was foggy and my head was pounding.\nA terrible hangover had taken hold of me, and I couldn't help but wake up from my sleep.\n“Ugh… …”\nA suppressed moan escaped from me. As I opened my eyes and looked around, I realized I was in my own room.\nWhy was I in my room? I clearly must have gone to Physis's room after drinking.\nI tried to roll my throbbing head and recalled the events of yesterday; Hugging him, confessing that I like him… …Hearing that he loves me, and even kissing him at the end. All the things started to fill my head again.\nI was going to run wild with happiness right away, but I couldn’t.\nBecause of what Physis said, I couldn’t tell whether everything that happened yesterday was real or just a dream.\n‘Yes. It’s a dream. Physis in reality is a coward, so he can’t say such things.’\nHe clearly said so. Moreover, the fact that I was in my room right now made it hard for me to think that yesterday was anything but a dream.\nHowever, I refused to lose hope. If what happened yesterday was real, his reaction today would be completely different.\nIf yesterday’s events were real, he would surely look at me with affectionate eyes today.\nBesides, today was the last day of the social gathering. I had no choice but to take a carriage with Physis and avoid the people I didn't want to see. At that time, I could determine whether what happened yesterday was a dream or a reality.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\"I will definitely visit you next time, Princess Rodenov.\"\n\"Didn't we agree to call me Adilun instead of Princess Rodenov? Next time, please just call me by my name. Anyway, I'll be waiting for you to come Isla.\"\nAt my words, Isla smiled brightly and nodded her head.\n“Yes!”\nThe long social gathering ended in vain, and I finally allowed myself a rare smile. Now we could stop the meaningless acting.\nPhysis and I maintained a cold attitude as we got into the carriage.\n\"Finally, it's over. I never want to do that kind of acting again.\"\nAs soon as I got on the carriage, I said to Physis.\nHow would he react to me? Would he put affection in those eyes, or Would he put only the usual kindness?\n“I see. Oh, by the way, Adilun.”\nHis gaze turned towards me. However, what was contained in it was not any kind of love... Just the kindness that he always showed me. Slightly disappointed by his reaction, I lowered my eyes and replied.\n\"Yes?\"\n\"Are you feeling better?\"\n\"....Yes? Ah yes... But why do you ask all of a sudden?\"\nCould it be... it wasn't a dream? My heart swelled with anticipation as a disappointment turned into hope.\n\"Yesterday, you collapsed in front of my room, so I secretly moved you to your room. It was almost a big deal. If someone with ill intentions or someone else had found you, the play we had worked on would have been useless.\"\n\"Is that so... Did something happen that time?\"\n\"No. You just knocked on my door a few times and then collapsed. You don't know how surprised I was. Please Adilun takes care of yourself a little more.\"\nPhysis' somewhat stern attitude extinguished my anticipation.\n'Ah, it was just a dream after all.'\n“… …Yes. I'll be careful.”\n\"I was lucky to find you... anyway, I moved you to your bedroom. Please be moderate with alcohol next time. You understand, right?\"\n“Yes… …”\nI answered sullenly.\nHe was looking at me with a slightly bitter expression, probably angry at my sloppy attitude… …I couldn’t help but feel sad about that.\nI hoped it wasn’t a dream, but… …It was nothing more than a dream after all. Perhaps that dream would gradually fade from my memory. Dreams were always something that leaves behind regret and disappears.\n“I’m sorry, Physis. I just drank because I was frustrated, I didn't think it would turn out like this..”\n\"Since you seem to have reflected enough, I will leave it at that.\"\nI apologized to him again, but he still seemed to be a little angry with me and maintained a cold attitude.\nI knew he was saying those things because he was worried about me. However, I couldn't hide my sadness toward him.\nA slightly overwhelming emotion welled up inside me. Was it because I had heard the words 'I love you' in my dream and exchanged an affectionate kiss with him? It was just a dream, and one that would be forgotten in a moment... but its aftermath was too great, and I slightly reddened my eyes.\n“Uh.”\n“Ah, Adilun?”\nUnknowingly, tears flowed from my eyes. Just because I was sad, because the moment we had confirmed each other's feelings was simply a dream... I couldn't hold back my tears.\nAs I suddenly burst into tears, Physis looked at me with a bewildered expression.\nI couldn't help but feel ashamed and pitiful about myself.\n\"Ugh...sob.\"\n\"Uh, Adilun. Why are you suddenly crying? Did I make you angry?\"\n\"No, no. It's not that... ...It's just that I had a dream today, and it was so sad that it wasn't real. So suddenly, I started crying...\"\nPhysis was flustered, not knowing what to do, as he watched me continue to shed tears. Even after seeing it, I couldn’t stop crying.\nAs if a dam had collapsed in my heart, I felt a certain emotion inside me that I had not recognized before rushing like a wave.\nAffection... Or love. I didn’t just like him, I wanted him to be my lifelong companion who would stand by my side.\n* * *\n[Physis's POV]\nI couldn’t help but be very upset.\nIt was because I didn’t know that she would be this sad that yesterday’s event was simply a dream. Like a child facing an unresolved problem for the first time, I just stared at Adilun, not knowing what to do.\n'What should I do?'\nShe cried miserably in a way that I had never seen before. But even so, I couldn't tell her the truth. I was afraid. In my eyes wasn't qualified or ready yet.\nBecause I didn’t dare to tell her that I loved her. I still remember the deadline that we had promised each other. Until that deadline, I had to keep my promise to her no matter what.\nEven though I knew that she had feelings for me, I had no other choice. I swore that I would do my best to atone for my sins until that deadline.\nIf I was easily swayed by this circumstance and broke my oath, I would do even more harm to her. She said it clearly before. She said she wanted to stand on equal ground with me without any sense of debt.\nI also thought the same way. If I confessed my feelings to her now, she might be happy.\nHowever, I would end up treating her with a sense of debt and that would become the starting point of another problem.\nThat's why... I had to be sure about it.\nSo I did not dare to speak the truth. Instead...\nI stretched out my arms toward the woman who was sitting in front of me.\n“… …!”\nI could feel her surprised reaction. But I didn't care and hugged her tightly until she calms down.\nAfter a while, she seemed to have regained some stability in my arms.\n“I don’t know what kind of dream it was, but Adilun.”\n“… …Yes.”\nBut the tears that still lingered seemed to show me the kind of sadness she felt.\n“If you miss that dream that much… … Surely that dream will come true. Definitely.”\n“… ...Will it?”\n\"Yes, I guarantee it. So don't cry anymore. And... I'm sorry for getting angry just now. I was worried about you...\"\n“I know that. Thanks for your concern, Physis.”\nI listened to her answer and tried to relax my arms.\n“Physis.”\n“Yes?”\n“Can we stay like this for a little longer?”\nAt Adilun's words that followed, I squeezed her tightly in my arms again.\n'I'm sorry I couldn't answer you, Adilun.'\n'But just give me some time. I will definitely confess to you on the day when I will be sure that I have atoned for my sins to you.'\nSo please wait until then.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThe carriage arrived in Rodenov in no time, and we returned to Caltix Castle. When the Duke asked me if there were any problems at the gathering, I said there were none, but that Adilun had made a new friend.\n\"A friend?\"\n“Yes. Isla Isvanthe… …She said that Adilun had saved her before and wanted to get to know her.”\n\"She was actually a good person?\"\n“A friend. Hahaha. Good... That's good. Ah, Physis by the way.”\n\"Yes, Your Excellency.\"\n\"Your family was looking for you. It's nothing serious, just to ask about your well-being. So, contact them later using the magic crystal ball.\"\n“Ah. Alright.”\n'They were looking for me from Ortaire?'\nI went straight to my room and activated the crystal ball.\n[Physis?]\n“Yes, Father. I just returned to Rodenov after the social gathering.”\n[Is that so?]\n\"Yes, but why did you contact me?\"\n[It’s not a big deal… … Your mother wanted to know about how you are.]\n“Mother?”\n[She just wanted to see you after a long time. Besides, Ortaire is in the midst of harvest, and the view of the fields is quite beautiful. It would be a good sightseeing opportunity for Princess Rodenov, so stop by Ortaire.]\n\"Uh... I'll ask Adilun first, and if she agrees, I'll come with her soon. But right now, I just finished the gathering, and I feel like I need to rest a bit.\"\n[Let her know that for now.]\n“Yes, Father.”\nCertainly, the fertile land of Ortaire shines its brightest just before the harvest. The golden waves of the wheat fields evoke a certain scent in one's heart just by looking at it.\nConsidering that even for me, who lived recklessly without being aware of my previous life, the scenery was deeply ingrained, it could be said that it was an amazing level of beauty. Adilun would surely love it too.\nMoreover, I had always wanted to show her Ortaire someday, so it was a good opportunity.\nThinking that I would definitely tell her next time... ...I threw myself onto the bed. There wasn't much physical fatigue, but due to the various things that happened at the gathering, I felt mentally exhausted, so I fell asleep quickly.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "60 – Ortaire (2)\n[Physis' POV]\nThe next day, I immediately looked for Adilun.\nAdilun had been looking at me with slightly swollen eyes since yesterday, and for some reason, I wanted to tease her.\n“Adilun!”\n\"Yes?\"\n\"I have to go to Ortaire this time... And I guess I'll have to stay in Ortaire again for a while.\"\n“… …Huh?”\nAt my words, suddenly, Adilun's dazed eyes widened.\n\"Are you going back?\"\nI nodded my head with a slightly sad expression to her immediate question,\n“Yes.”\n\"Ah, c-can't you stay?\"\nIn response to my firm answer, Adilun pitifully asked me back… …I told the truth in a hurry, thinking that the moment I tease her a little more, she would cry like yesterday.\nAnd I didn't want to do that, all I wanted was just to tease her a little.\n\"But there's one thing I haven't told you.\"\n“What?”\n“Actually, I was going to ask if you could come with me. If that's not possible for some reason, I would have gone alone. So… …Adilun would you like to go to Ortaire with me? It would be a bit lonely without you.”\n\"I-I can go! No, I'll go!\"\nAdilun didn't ask anything more to me, who was teasing her, and said urgently,\n“Really? That’s fortunate. Actually, I wanted to show you around Ortaire.”\n“Phew.”\nShe let out a sigh of relief, and I smiled at her and said.\n“Wouldn’t you like me to go somewhere else?”\n“… …No”\n“Why?”\nInstantly, her face turned red. I already knew the answer, but… … Still, whenever I saw a reaction like this from her, I became so happy that I couldn’t stop myself to tease her more.\n“Promise!”\n\"A promise...?\"\n“Y-yes... You promised that you will continue to stay here after the great duel. So that’s it. Promises are not meant to be broken.”\n“… …I see... Anyway, it seems like we'll be leaving soon, so we should prepare well. We'll have to stay in Ortaire for at least a month.\"\n“Yes!”\nAdilun said to me with a bright expression.\n\"You can look forward to it. Ortaire has the opposite characteristics of Rodenov, it's warm, and sometimes even hot... So just bring some thin clothes.\"\n\"I'll keep that in mind.\"\n\"Hm, it might be too hot, so I will make a separate arrangement with the family.\"\n“Thank you, Physis. But you don't have to worry too much. I'm skilled in magic.\"\n\"I know Adilun is skilled in magic, but… … Still, every time you use magic, you get tired.”\n“Well, that's also true. Thank you for being considerate.”\n\"I should do at least that much. After all, I am your fiancé.\"\nAt my response, Adilun's face became red again and she just smiled.\nRecently, Adilun's expressions had become more vivid, and that was something I was grateful for. At least it was evidence that I had been doing well so far.\n“uh… … Well. Yes.”\n\"Then I will tell my father about it. We'll probably leave next week.\"\n“Okay. I’ll have everything ready by then.”\n“Yes.”\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\nOrtaire; The place where Physis was born and raised.\nAs he said, unlike Rodenov, the weather was warm even in winter, and snowfall was extremely rare. Due to its warm climate, it had several grain belts… … It was a place where wealth overflows.\nPhysis asked me to go there with him.\nAt first, I thought he wanted to leave me, but it turned out that he just wanted to express his desire to go with me.\nAnyway, I was ecstatic as if I were flying.\n'Isn't it where Physis lived? Isn't it a place that reflects his life?' Just going there made me feel like I was getting to know him better, so I felt very excited.\nAlthough my mood was a little down because of the too-sweet dream I had last time, Physis' affectionate attitude made me feel better.\nHe wanted to go with me to the place where he used to live… … The gloomy feeling flew away at once.\n“Miss.”\nIt was Mina.\n“Yes, Mina. What’s the matter?”\n\"Did something good happen? Your expression is much brighter.\"\n“Yes?”\n“You just seemed a bit down since you came back yesterday.”\nMy gloomy appearance must have been noticeable. It wasn't just to Physis, but also to Mina.\n“I just felt strangely depressed yesterday. You know, those days when you're just not yourself. Anyway, I'm fine now. Actually, I'm happy.\"\nI tried to be vague. If I said it was because of Physis here, there was a possibility that he would be harmed for nothing.\n“Did something happen? I think I just saw Sir Physis coming out of your room a moment ago.”\n“Yes. Physis asked me to go to Ortaire with him.”\n“Ortaire?”\n“Yes. So we're leaving next week. Mina, can you help me to pack my things?”\n\"Of course. By the way, if it's Ortaire... ...You will need some light clothes... Don't worry, I'll prepare them. And, how was the social gathering?\"\n“Social gathering… …”\nI recalled the events of the social gathering. It wasn’t all good things, but… … Clearly, there had been results. I made a friend, and I was able to be sure of my feelings about Physis.\n“It wasn’t bad. I even made a friend.”\n“A friend?”\nAs if Mina was surprised, her pale golden eyes widened.\n“Yes. There is a princess I helped in the past called Isla Isvante… … She thank me and...”\n“Ah. I’m so glad Shall we send an invitation to tea time later?”\n“Yes. But first of all, staying in Ortaire comes first, at least for a month.”\n“I know, Miss. Then I'll go prepare to pack with the maids.\"\n“Thanks. I’ll go see Physis in a minute. Where is he now?”\n“Sir Physis… … probably done with his training and resting by now. How about checking the training hall?\"\n\"The training hall? Then... he might be getting hungry by now?\"\n\"Yes. He usually eats something light after his training. Oh.\"\nMina, who suddenly hit her palm with her fist, whispered in my ear.\n“It wouldn’t be bad to bring the food. To the extent that I can picture Sir Physis being very happy.”\n“Is that so?”\n\"Yes, and Miss, cheer up.\"\n“Yes? What?”\n“You like Sir Physis, don’t you?”\nAt her words, my face became hot with embarrassment.\n“Uh, how did you know?”\n\"Miss, it's hard not to notice. Your subtle sad expression since you arrived yesterday, sudden excited expressions, the feeling of being down... And most of all, your gaze always following Sir Physis.\"\n“… …”\nI couldn't say anything. Hearing her words, I realized how obvious my feelings were.\nI was like a naive girl in love for the first time.\n\"But fortunately, Sir Physis doesn't turn his gaze to other women... And he's already engaged to you. So, there's no danger of losing him to someone else.\"\n“No, that’s not it.”\n“Yes?”\n\"There were some girls at the social gathering who were flirting with him.\"\nMina asked me back with a surprised expression. However, I felt a strange smile from her, it might be my imagination.\n“Oh my gosh. Who?”\n“Selina Idenea.”\n“Ah.”\nMina was convinced at once.\n\"Then you should try even harder to win over Sir Physis. Miss, I'm not sure if you know, but Sir Physis is quite popular even among the maids and servants.\"\n\"Really?\"\n“Yes. He’s the lady’s fiancé, so they don’t openly approach him, but… … If Sir Physis was merely a family servant, they would have.\"\n\"…That's true.\"\nI understood. He might not have been the perfect fiancé before, but lately, he was perfect. He was affectionate, had considerable power, and was considerate of others.\nMoreover, his appearance was overwhelming, and there was no one who could compare to him.\n\"What about you, Mina?\"\n“Me? Nope. I don’t pay attention to people who have a fiancé.”\n“What if Physis had no fiancé?”\n\"I would have tried hard. A groom like him is rare.\"\nI was about to get angry at Mina's words, but it was such a natural fact that I couldn't even be angry.\n“As expected.”\n\"Be prepared, miss. Men like him tend to attract many women.\"\n“… …Yes.”\n\"So, let's start by sticking together frequently. When you go to Ortaire this time, it wouldn't be a bad idea to stamp your mark on him completely.\"\n“Stamp my mark?”\n\"Yes. I mean...a kiss mark.\"\n“… …!”\nHeat rushed to my face. We hadn't even kissed yet, and she was already talking about it.\n\"Isn't it too early for that...?\"\n“I don't think so. You’re even engaged, is there anything else to hide? If you just put a stamped mark on him, it’s marriage right away, marriage. Then you can legally brag about your ownership of Sir Physis to the other women.”\n“But maybe that’s a little too much… …”\n“That is what it means. Anyway, try your best. If it was the real Sir Physis of the past, I would absolutely want to stop you, but looking at his changed appearance recently, there is no one like him.”\n“… … I’ll try.”\n“Cheer up, Miss.”\nAt Mina's words, I could only nod my head.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "61 – Ortaire (3)\n[Physis' POV]\nThe week passed by quickly, and before I knew it, it was time for us to head to Ortaire.\nAdilun looked quite excited as if she was looking forward to visiting my hometown.\nSeeing Adilun so happy brought a smile to my own face too, and we both set off toward the teleportation gate with beaming expressions.\n“Coming to think of it, the Count and Countess might be surprised to see me.”\n\"They'll definitely be surprised.\"\nUndoubtedly, they would be overjoyed to see Adilun. I could already imagine their reaction.\n“Is Lord Huian doing well?”\n“Brother, He is probably… …busy with work.”\n\"He isn't spending money on gambling, is he?\"\nCould it be that the previous National Foundation Day left such a strong impression about him on Adilun? It appeared that Adilun had formed the perception of her older brother as a gambler.\nI pondered if his portrayal during National Foundation Day had made such a lasting impact. In Adilun's mind, he seemed to be firmly associated with the image of a gambler.\n“Fortunately not. With the money he earned at that time, he bought gifts for people in our family.”\n\"That's a relief.\"\nShe said that and took my hand.\n\"Let's go.\"\n“Yes.”\nThis time, only three of us were heading to Ortaire: Adilun, me, and Mina to help Adilun. Since it was a vacation trip, we didn't require a large group.\n“Well then, have a wonderful trip, Adilun.”\n“Yes, Father.”\nAfter bidding farewell to the people of Rodenov, Adilun took hold of my hand, and together we crossed the teleportation gate. Naturally, Mina accompanied us as well.\nI closed my eyes for a brief moment, and upon opening them, I could sense a change in the surrounding atmosphere. Instead of the cold and biting wind ...A gentle warmth caressed us.\nAdilun also seemed to feel the change as well.\n“It’s definitely warmer than Rodenov.”\n\"Come to think of it, it's your first time in Ortaire, Adilun?\"\n\"Yes, it's fascinating. During National Foundation Day, I was in a carriage and didn't notice the climate change, so I couldn't really feel it... but now I can definitely sense it. It's a bit hot.\"\n\"In that case, please give me your robe to carry. I'll hold onto it since Mina already has her hands full.\"\n“Ah, thank you, Physis.”\nAdilun looked at me and smiled brightly.\n“Welcome, Second Master, and… …Princess Rodenov… … uh?”\nThe knight guarding the teleportation gate looked surprised and stared at Adilun.\n“Yes. Ahm... Where is my father?”\nAlthough we expected this reaction, it was still unpleasant to have even a knight from a respected family gazing at Adilun like that. With a slightly uncomfortable expression, I addressed the knight.\n\"Ah, yes. I apologize. The Count is currently awaiting the arrival of the Second Young Master and Princess Rodenov in the hall of Ortaire Castle.\"\n“I see. Let’s go, Adilun.”\n“Yes, Physis.”\n\"Oh, and there's no need for separate guidance. After all, this is also my home.\"\n\"Understood, Young Master.\"\n“Then, Miss, I’ll be unpacking in your room first.”\n\"Thank you, Mina. Knight, if it's not too much trouble, could you take her to the butler? He just needs to inform her about the room I'll be staying in.\"\n“I understand, Princess. Let’s go, Miss Mina.”\n“Thank you, Sir.”\nWhile Mina and the knight headed toward the butler, Adilun and I made our way to the hall of the castle. The castle wasn't too far from the location of the teleportation gate, so we reached it quickly.\nAs we entered through the castle gate, I caught sight of my father, mother, and older brother.\nWhile my family members were happy to see me, they were shocked when they saw Adilun next to me.\n“Oh my goodness.”\n“Princess Rodenov… …right?”\n\"Yes, it's been a while. Count Ortaire, Countess, and Lord Huian, thank you for inviting me to Ortaire.\"\nAdilun greeted my family with an elegant demeanor. When she raised her head again, a smile appeared on her face.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThe place where the storm of surprise had just passed was now filled with my father and mother's nagging.\n\"If something like this happens, shouldn't you have contacted us first, Physis?\"\n\"I'm sorry. I couldn't contact you because I was busy with the northern social gathering. And I also forgot because Adilun had just shed her scales.\"\n\"Well, regardless. Lady Rodenov, congratulations once again. You must have gone through a lot... I'm truly relieved.\"\n\"Thank you, madam.\"\nAfter that, they exchanged various updates and stories with each other... and eventually, my mother called Adilun aside.\n“Well then, Princess Rodenov, would you like to talk with me for a minute? Let's have a cup of tea while we're at it.\"\n“Ah, yes.”\nApparently, the women had their own stories to tell.\n\"Oh well! Let me take you somewhere...\"\nMy older brother suddenly grabbed my arm and started taking me somewhere.\n“Well? what’s going on?”\n“It’s nothing… … How is your relationship with Princess Rodenov these days?”\n“It's good. We've definitely become closer than before. Perhaps, unless I make a big mistake, Adilun won’t treat me like she used to.”\n\"...Really? Well, that's a relief. But you, go to your room right now and take care of the letters that have piled up there.\"\n\"Letters?\"\n\"Yeah. I couldn't just burn them, so I left them there... After National Foundation Day and the great duel, a huge amount of letters came to you from all over the place. It seems like they didn't know that you were staying in Rodenov for a while... Get rid of them somehow, whether by burning or tearing them.\"\n“Ah, I see.”\n“Get rid of it quickly. If Princess Rodenov finds out about that… … Something scary might happen.”\n“I know that much!”\nAfter answering that, I ran straight to my room.\n***\n[Adilun's POV]\nThe place where I was led to by the Countess of Ortaire was a peaceful-looking garden. Various colored flowers were combined to create a beautiful scenery, and a small table was placed among them.\nThe garden seemed to rival even a winter garden, and I couldn't help but express my admiration.\n“Amazing.”\n\"Oh my, really? Thank you so much. This is a garden that I personally took care of. I didn't use any magic or other difficult methods, I did it all by hand.\"\n\"It's truly impressive. Taking care of a garden personally must be quite challenging...\"\n\"Since it's something I genuinely enjoy, it's not a problem. Anyway, let's have a seat.\"\n\"Ah, yes. Madam. May I ask why you called me separately?\"\n\"To tell you the truth, I have always wanted to thank you.\"\n“… … Yes?”\n\"Our once unruly second son began to change, all thanks to you, Princess. At first, no one believed it. I was no exception, considering all the disturbances my second son caused in the past 20 years. But then, he suddenly started changing.\"\nThe Countess recalled the past with rather vague eyes.\n\"It was probably when he fell off his horse.\"\n\"He fell off his horse?\"\n\"Yes. After that incident, he started behaving as if he had undergone a transformation. And did the princess know that he abruptly went to Rodenov to offer his apologies?\"\n“Yes… …”\nI knew all too well. Physis was on the brink of death back then.\n\"Anyway, after that, that child genuinely began to change. His violent and aggressive tendencies vanished, and he willingly assisted the servants... It reached a point where I questioned if he was truly my son.\"\n“Is that so...”\n\"Yes, and you know what's even more intriguing? Afterward, I spoke with Physis privately. I asked him if I could trust in his change... And you know what he said?\"\n“What did he say?”\n\"He said that earning trust wouldn't be easy, so he would demonstrate it through his actions. And he credited you for bringing about that change. So, thank you, Princess Rodenov. No, Adilun. Thanks to you, my son has transformed.\"\nAt her words, I lowered my head in shame. Actually, I didn’t do anything.\nStill, to hear that he changed because of me,, I felt an unexplained sense of joy.\n\"...It's too much. I, too, have undergone significant changes thanks to Physis.\"\n“Ah, Adilune”\n“Yes?”\n“Can I ask you something?”\n\"Yes, please go ahead.\"\n“What do you think of Physis?”\nTo the Countess’ question that followed, I… …I had no choice but to lower my head and blush.\n\"Oh, I see. That's a relief. Even though there are so many people who are engaged but have their hearts elsewhere... It's really fortunate. Please take care of our Physis.\"\n“… …Yes.”\n“Ah, then, first of all, we should stop the princesses who are aiming for that child right now, shouldn't we?”\n\"Pardon? Are there princesses pursuing him?\"\n\"Oh dear, I forgot to mention this. In Physis' room... there are letters from various princesses across the empire. Not to boast, but is Physis usually considered attractive? And with the significant role he played during National Foundation Day... Other princesses must be interested. It's best to address that matter swiftly to ensure Physis doesn't entertain any other thoughts.\"\n“… …Yes.”\nWithout realizing it, my expression had turned tense, and the Countess remarked upon seeing me like that.\n\"Oh my, you're overflowing with energy. Go quickly. We can talk more later. You'll stay in Ortaire for a while, right?\"\n\"Yes, I plan to stay for as long as possible. Thank you, madam.\"\n“See you later, then”\n“Yes.”\nWith those words, I turned and made my way directly to Physis' room.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "62 – Ortaire (4)\n[Physis' POV]\nAs soon as I heard my older brother's words, I hurriedly returned to my room. Sure enough, there were huge piles of letters stacked on my desk.\nIf Adilun, who had already expressed her feelings towards me, saw this... It might be a big surprise to her.\nI began to sort out the letters.\nIn my heart, I wanted to burn them all at once... But I couldn’t, because there might be some important letters within this pile, which I needed to carefully sift through.\nStill, I threw away all the letters with unfamiliar names that didn't seem important. It was obvious that they would be full of contents that were not a big deal anyway.\nContinuing to the task of sorting through the pile of letters, I was relieved that I didn't rashly burn them all.\nIt was because there was a letter from Princess Lobelia. I took a quick look just in case, and there was a note saying to come to the imperial palace with Adilun when we had time.\nAt the end, I decided to keep this one and quickly burned the rest.\nI started by gathered mana in my hand.\nThere was a high chance of arousing suspicion if I lit the fire myself... So I had to burn them quickly.\nBut just as I was about to burn the letters... a sudden knock echoed through the door.\n“Physis? Are you in there?”\nMy heart sank at the sound of the voice I least wanted to hear in this situation. And top of that, I hadn't even finished handling the letters yet...\n“Yes, yes!”\nDespite my reluctance, I couldn't just ignore her, so I hastily opened the door.\nAs the door opened, a thought struck me suddenly.\n‘Why should I be afraid?’\nAdilun was speechless as she looked at the scenery in my room. The sight of hundreds of letters scattered all over the room was probably the reason for this reaction.\n“… …What is all this?”\nHer tone was quite bleak. So I got a bad feeling and answered her quickly.\n\"They are letters sent to me. I think they are all the letters that came while I was staying in Rodenov.\"\n\"I know they are letters. What's in them?\"\n“That, well, uh… … .”\n\"Most of them are letters asking to meet, right?\"\n“There are so many names I’ve never seen before, so I was just about to burn them all.”\n“I see. But Physis, you can’t do that. The princesses must have put so much effort into writing those letters with great care… …You can't just burn them all like that. So, wouldn’t it be better to read it once?”\nAt her suggestion, my intuition suddenly spoke to me.\nThe situation didn't seem very good. I didn't know where her anger came from, but when I saw her, she clearly looked jealous… … I knew that if I answered incorrectly here, I would suffer for nothing.\n\"That's not going to happen. No. Never. It's unnecessary. Even if it was written with all their heart and soul... I already have a fiancee named Adilun. Letters like that would only cause trouble for me.\"\n'Haa. With this answer, her heart would have been satisfied quite a bit.'\nThinking so, I raised my head and looked at her with a nervous feeling, and Adilun's strained expression eased a little as she looked at me... then she looked at my hand and stiffened her expression again.\n“Is that s-so... By the way… …What is that letter you are holding in your hand? You seem to be holding on to it with great care… …”\nHer suspicious gaze reached my hand. She was looking at the letter sent by Princess Lobelia.\n'She asked about our well-being and said she would call me and her soon.'\nSince there was nothing wrong with the contents, I immediately showed her the letter.\n“Ah, this is a letter from Princess Lobelia. She said she would like to meet me and Adilun soon. And also we can't just damage the imperial family letter, can we? That's why I was going to show it to you.”\n\"Is that so? Let me see it.\"\nI immediately handed her the letter, and she quickly scanned it before nodding her head.\n\"I understand now. But... Those letters over there, you really don’t need them anymore, right?\"\n“Of course. I was going to burn them all down.”\n“No. Physis doesn’t have to go through all that trouble..”\n-Snap!\nAt that moment, Adilun circulated mana and snapped her fingers once.\nImmediately, the piled of letters caught fire and began to burn all at once.\nNot even ashes were left in the place where they were burned. Thinking that as if it was a warning from her, I felt a little scared… …but at the same time, it felt good.\nThe fact that Adilun was jealous for me, made me happy. It meant that she liked me that much. In truth, a desired for monopoly could even be a way to confirm someone's affection, as long as it wasn't too excessive. So I was relieved that Adilun wasn't angry with me.\n\"To meet separately... There is no princess who made an appointment to meet separately, right?\"\n\"I didn't have time for that. I don't even think about it.\"\n“… …I see. I’m sorry for behaving rudely. It was an excessive curiosity, wasn't it...?\"\n“It’s okay because it’s you.”\n\"Oh okay... Thank you.\"\n“Then shall we go out for a while? There’s a place I’d like to show you.”\n“Where?”\n“There is a scenery that I really want to show you. Please follow me.”\nI took her hand and led her out of the room.\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\nI already knew that he was popular.\nHowever... amidst the feast of those fresh love letters that covered the entire room, even I, who already knew this fact, couldn't prevent myself from feeling shady jealousy and possessiveness that raised its head inside me.\nSo, I burned them all. Without letting him touch them, I did it myself. It was surely an act that crossed the line... and could be considered unnecessary meddling on my part.\nBut... I wanted to do it.\nRecently, it seemed like I had been losing my temper too often whenever it came to Physis-related matters.\nIt was like same in Selina’s case, and it was like that now too.\nAt a critical moment, these points might hold me back. No, it would definitely hinder me.\nEven so, the reason why I had no choice but to be overly emotional about things related to him… … Because I couldn’t let someone else take away the person I liked just because it might hold me back a little.\nMaybe it was because I couldn’t lose the only person like love in my life.\nThat was why I intended to actively step up in matters related to him from now on. Regret always comes too late... and if that regret attacked me as a result of losing what was most precious to me, I won't be able to forgive myself.\nAfter burning all the letters, Physis looked at me with a slightly relieved face and then began leading me somewhere.\nHe seemed to have grown accustomed to holding my hand now, so he grabbed it whenever it was like this. Of course, so did I. And every time he do that… …I felt a sense of fulfillment.\nHow long had we been walking? We didn't go too far. We just walked a little after leaving the Ortaire Castle... and various scenery caught my eye.\nA windmill that spins while leaning against the wind. And in front… … A golden wave that shone just by looking at it.\nAnd above it, the blue sky embraced the golden sun.\nIt was a scenery that couldn't be seen in Rodenov. Looking at the wide golden wave, it felt like this place was the source of life, to the point where I could feel any kind of emotion.\n“Wow… …”\nI couldn't help but let out a sigh of admiration. This was one of the most beautiful sights I had ever seen in my life, if not the most.\nIt reminded me of the view from the bell tower of the Caltix Fortress, a place I wanted to show Physis someday.\n“Isn’t it beautiful? In fact, I didn’t know how beautiful this scene was at first. To be exact, until I met Adilun.”\n“Me?”\n“Yes. Before that, I was a twisted guy somewhere. I couldn’t feel what others felt, and I had no concept of beauty. However, I wondered if I had realized some more humane feelings after meeting Adilun. So when I reflected on my life again, this scene came to my mind.”\n“… … I see.”\n“So I really wanted to show you this scene. The scenery of Rodenov, where you lived, was very nice, but You see, the place where one was born and raised always has a certain scent that can't be surpassed. Maybe it’s the same with Adilun. The most beautiful place for you… … There must be a place like that.”\n\"Yes, that's right.\"\n“Since I showed you this scenery today… … Someday... next time, I hope you will show me such a place too.”\n\"Yes, I will.\"\nIt was such a beautiful sight. And… … Just seeing that scene with this person next to me made me felt like the world was widening a lot.\nThe wide sky, the vast wheat field, and the little me and him standing there.\nHow long had we been there?\nEven though the sun was shining… … It started raining suddenly. It was an unusual experience. A strange sight with clouds on one side and the sun shining on the other.\nEven that was new to me, as it was an unimaginable sight in Rodenov.\nI felt the cold raindrops hitting me little by little, and I heard Physis' voice.\n“This. Ah… … . Come in quickly. You might catch a cold again.”\n“… …Yes.”\nAt my regretful look, he comforted me.\n“I’m sorry, but it’s okay because we can come back tomorrow.”\n“I see.”\nWhile stepping on his sidewalk, I stumbled.\n“Oh!”\n“Adilun!”\nHe wrapped his arms around me in an instant. My body, which started to get wet little by little, touched my body, and at some point, I was held in his arms like a princess.\n\"Is it okay?\"\n\"Oh, yes. I was just a little surprised.\"\nHowever, I couldn't ask him to let me down since my body was still trembling from the aftermath of my misstep, and one of my shoes had a broken heel.\n“Anyway, this kind of land doesn’t seem suitable for walking with your shoes right now. I was careless.”\nPerhaps noticing my state, Physis gave me a strong embrace. Without even realizing it, I got more closer to him, burying myself in his arms.\n“Then could you take me there like this?”\nAs I mumbled in his arms, I felt him nodding. His embrace carried the same scent as before.\nA scent that was refreshing and cool.\nI had been curious about where this scent came from. It wasn't just the smell of a simple perfume, but rather his own natural scent that was fragrant.\nBut now, in this situation, I finally understood.\nIt was the result of his temperament, born under the vast sky of Ortaire. As his temperament seeped into the mana, it gave off this fragrance to someone sensitive to mana like me.\nEven as he carried me in his arms and ran, I simply enjoyed his fragrance, feeling comfortable in his embrace.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "63 – Ortaire (5)\n[Adilun's POV]\nTo be honest, I could have created a magic barrier to block the rain, but I intentionally chose not to.\nI just simply enjoyed spending time with him.\nI leaned on him... because I liked the time when he embraced me tightly.\nOur bodies were touching each other, but my heart was still reaching for him, and it saddened me that our hearts couldn’t reach each other.\nEven so, the fact that our bodies were touching gave me hope that someday our hearts would also touch each other.\nDespite this, I hold onto the hope that one day our hearts would meet, just as our bodies were touching right now.\nPerhaps, the thought that he might also have feelings for me, to some extent was also swirling inside me.\nOtherwise, he wouldn't have treated me so kindly.\nEven when I caught a cold, or when I shed my scales... He had always made me his first priority ever since the day he apologized to me.\n'If so, can I have hope? If I confess to him someday, wouldn’t he answer my heart?'\nIn fact, even my actions right now… …clearly showed that I have feelings for him. What woman in the world would embrace a man she didn't like? Especially in this manner, whenever the opportunity arose.\nHe wasn't someone who was unaware...nor was he stupid. Maybe he knew my feelings too.\nThat was why I had to be even more cautious. I was afraid that if I confessed too hastily, even this relationship that was gradually getting closer would fall apart.\nHe referred to himself as a coward in my dream. Maybe... it unveiled my own true nature. I was a coward as well. I was afraid of rejection, so I couldn't gather the courage to speak up. I was that kind of coward.\nThe possibility that I might not be able to embrace him like this put up a thin wall in front of me.\nBut...I couldn't break through that thin wall. I was afraid that the warmth of his embrace, the tenderness he showed me, and the sweet dreams I had made would all disappear.\nSo I couldn't take even one step forward.\nFor the first time in my life, I had a desire for something. Even though I had never felt that way before...I couldn't act properly like a fool.\nIf I were to approach him more aggressively, would he accept me? It was uncertain.\nHowever, I could only hope... That he liked me too... He was hesitant because he was also afraid that our relationship would become awkward…\nIf so, it would be nice if this relationship could be maintained.\nThe thin wall that separated us would eventually wear away with the passage of time… … and beyond that wall, we would be able to face each other and laugh together.\nBut maybe it was an impossible dream.\nSuch thoughts transformed the excitement in my heart into a sharp ache. I couldn't predict if another captivating person might appear and whisk him away from me.\nI had always emphasized the importance of respect and being seen for who I truly am. I tested him with these convictions.\nAnd those tests... were now testing me in reverse.\n'Have I ever respected him?'\n'Have I genuinely acknowledged his current state?'\nThe answer was no. I had just accepted the kindness he showed me. I had exploited his guilt and his desire to assist me.\nAs soon as I realized that fact, I felt a chill run down my spine involuntarily.\nWhat was different about me now compared to the way I used to be?\nWas this just me playing with his heart?\nI only ever said thank you to him, but I never did anything that he would truly appreciate.\nThe one-year period I talked about before...\nNow, with less than eight months left, that time and the words I said to put all of our debts to each other behind us and start anew... It applied to me too.\nWould he really like the woman who only took his dedication for granted and just threw a single word of thanks to him?\n'Will the thin wall that I cannot overcome crumble over time?'\nAfter thinking deeply while in his arms, I concluded that it was not going to crumble on its own.\nIt was something that I had to work hard for. Hoping that the wall would crumble on its own was, in the end, tantamount to doing nothing.\nTherefore... I had to approach him. I had to do something for him too. For the eight months of mutual confidence, I had to dedicate my heart to him.\nIf we continued this relationship of dedication to each other, the debt between us would eventually disappear, and trust in each other would grow in the empty space, and that trust would bloom into a flower called love.\n'Let’s not wait, Adilun.'\n'I have to go to him directly. That's the only way I can tell him that I like him.'\nAs I was lost in such thoughts, Physis ran faster and got us out of the area where it was raining.\nThe soft sunlight was dazzling.\n\"Fortunately, it's not raining here. Thank goodness.\nHe said to me with his wet hair.\n\"Yes. That's right.\"\n“I’m sorry. I never thought it would be like this.”\n\"It's okay. It was beautiful. Especially...I've never seen a scene where it rains in an area where the sun is shining. Wet clothes will dry. But...I don't want to dry off right now. Anyway, please let me down now.\"\nI smiled brightly at him as I got out of his arms. So that he could feel relieved when he looked at me.\n\"Is that so?\"\n\"Yes. It's a new experience for me too.\"\n\"...Yes. I see.\"\n“Physis.”\n\"Yes?\"\n\"When you were running with me in your arms, I thought about it carefully.\"\n\"What did you think about?\"\n“I thought I might be a really mean person to you.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“The promise we made for a year… … During that time, I told you to devote yourself to me. But...”\n“Yes...”\n“But is that right? Maybe I am using the guilt in your heart to satisfy my own self-interest?”\n“… …No. Absolutely not. It’s something I like to do. I did not move for you out of a simple sense of guilt.”\n\"Then... ...Can you tell me why?\"\n\"Initially, it was a sense of guilt. It felt like my insults had obscured your light. So, I wanted to restore that light. But as I spent time with you... I realized something.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"That you are already a shining person. That's why I made a vow to myself. To see how far you can reach.\"\n\"I shine?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"No, I'm just a cowardly woman who only takes advantage of you?\"\n“If you just taking advantage, would Princess Isla want to be friends with you? At the social gathering, though it was a minority, didn't some of the princesses admire you? You haven't reached your full potential yet. Because of me.\"\n“… …hmm.”\nWas this how he saw me?\nIt was funny. I had never thought of myself as a remarkable person, but he oddly saw me as someone special.\nThe fact made me so happy.\nEventually, I took out one of the bricks from the thin wall.\n“You know. I have something I want to tell you honestly.”\n\"...Yes.\"\n“I want to be with you all the time.”\n\"Is that...a confession?\"\nI shook my head. No, this wasn't a confession. Just.... ...a vow to myself.\n“It’s not a confession, it’s a promise.”\n“What promise?”\n“I’m determined to find out a little more about you. So I won’t say that I like you yet. Have I told you before that I need to be sure about you?”\n“… …Yes.”\n\"That applies to me too. I need to be certain about myself. To find the answer if I am qualified to stand by your side. And when I find that answer, I will gain the confidence to be with you.\"\n\"I see.\"\n\"Yes, so for now, I won't say that I like you. But...\"\n“But?”\n\"I will stamp it, at least once.\"\nHe looked at me with a puzzled expression as if he heard an abrupt comment. Well, saying something about stamping was sudden. It must have sounded like nonsense.\nRather than giving an explanation, I went straight into action.\nLike a dream I had a long time ago, instead of grabbing him by the collar, I pulled Physis' neck towards me and kissed him on the lips.\nI thought about sticking my tongue out, but I didn't. For now, it was just a stamp.\nLater, when he and I had confidence in each other, we would finally send upright affection toward each other.\nThen it wouldn't just end with a stamp.\nAfter an eternity-like moment passed, I released my arms around his neck.\nHe looked stunned.\n\"Oh, Adilun?\"\nI looked at him as if nothing had happened and playfully smiled. The momentary ecstasy signaled regret in my mind, but I tried to control it, hoping that this fleeting ecstasy would become a happiness that permeates life in the future.\n'Yes. Right now, just this much.'\n\"Yes?\"\n“This… …”\n\"This is... a stamp. It's a stamp to prevent other princesses from flirting. I will restrict every woman who approaches you from now on and burn all the letters they send.\"\n“A stamp... I see. Are you telling me not to look elsewhere?”\n\"Yes. To keep your heart from wandering elsewhere. I won't do that when I have confidence in myself. \"\n“The reason… … May I ask?”\n\"No. Think about it yourself.\"\nI inwardly repeated the reason why I didn't answer him.\n'Anyway, when that time comes... you won't even notice any other woman besides me. Cause you can’t help but love me.'\nTherefore… … The reason was a secret.\n'I’ll tell you later, Physis.'\nAt that moment, I smiled like a desired fox more than anyone else.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "64 – Commitment\n[Physis' POV]\nThinking about earlier, I stroked my lips.\n'How many hours have I been locked in my room like this?'\nToday, Adilun kissed me and said, 'It's a stamp...,' as if it was some kind of a seal.\nEven though she knew it was not a dream, she could act like that. Thinking about it, I felt a little pathetic about myself.\nThe weight of Adilun's kindness towards me was gradually becoming heavier.\n'How can I repay her kindness?'\n'She said until she is confident... can I have confidence in myself?'\n'How many times do I have to doubt myself and resolve those doubts before I can fully trust myself?'\nThe answer was still unknown.\nWe still had a long time left and we would get to know each other through many experiences.\nIn the process, I would have confidence in myself... and she would have confidence in herself.\nThere was no need for impatience. I would remain true to myself, and she would do the same. Together, we would support each other and proceed gradually, one step at a time.\nAfter finishing my thoughts, I opened the window for a moment.\n'What should I do? Should I step outside and feel the wind for a moment before going to bed?'\nRecently, I had been having trouble sleeping at night. During the social gathering, it was because of Adilun's defenseless appearance, and today it was because of the shy kiss she had given me.\nShe would approach me more actively... and all I could do was not push her away.\nI also wanted to approach her more actively. When and how I could do that?\n'I will have to think about it.'\nAs I stepped out of the room, unlike the warm day, I felt a bit of a cold night breeze blowing.\nIn the end, it was a complicated thought. But I had to continue with these thoughts.\nAfter staring outside for a while, I heard someone's voice.\n“What are you doing here?”\nIt was the voice of the same person who had been making my head complicated all this time; Adilun.\nShe stood next to me under the moonlight and stared straight ahead.\n“It’s just that my head is complicated because of you.”\n“Aahaha, I knew it would be like that.\"\nWhen I glanced to the side, her smiling face was more beautiful than anyone else's.\nWas it the magic of the nighttime? Or was it because it overlapped with what had happened during the day, it was so fascinating that my mind became hazy.\n\"I... don't really know.\"\n\"Yes, I thought so. Actually, I'm not sure either. So, how was it? My first kiss.\"\nTo tell the truth, it was the second kiss now... but I answered honestly.\n\"Honestly, I didn't hate it.\"\n“Eh, is that all?\"\nAdilun looked disappointed.\n\"If I just said it was good, wouldn't it shake your determination that you've vowed to think about?\"\n\"Well, that's true. Please think about it more. I'll keep shaking you as I did earlier.\"\n\"Like earlier?\"\n\"I'll be more active than earlier. So that other girls won't dare to touch you.\"\n“If you act so frighteningly, I might run away too.”\n\"Try running away. I'll tie you up.\"\nAt my playful words, she responded with a mischievous smile.\n\"Hahaha, this is really... I'm trapped tightly.\"\n\"There will be many things to come in the future. For both you and me.\"\n\"That's right.\"\n\"I don't know what our future will be like, but I want to be with you all the way.\"\n\"I feel that same.\"\n\"Let's do well together. There will be many difficulties, and there will be times when we will have distrust towards each other.\"\n“Yes.”\n“Still, I think we can do well. From our first meeting, things were the worst, weren't they? Since we've come this far from that kind of relationship, we can do even better.”\n“I feel a little uneasy. The anxiety of whether I'm the right person for you... It overwhelms me every time you show me kindness.”\n“… … I’d like to say there’s no need to worry about that, but right now even I can’t say that.”\n“In the end, it seems like we need time. Both me and you.”\nI looked at her, standing beside me, and spoke in a subdued voice. She seemed to hesitate for a moment, looked up at the sky, then turned her head towards me and said:\n“On the day when the promised time is up, I have something I definitely want to say to you.”\n“Me too… I also have something I definitely want to say to you.”\n“Then, let’s try our best until then. Got it?”\n“Yes. Adilun.”\n“Shall we go in now?”\n“No. I want to stay like this a little longer.”\n“… …Yes. Okay.”\nWe didn't say anything else. We were lost in our own thoughts, just gazing at the sky together.\nBut that was enough. A sense of satisfaction filled us both, and we both felt a weight lifted off our shoulders.\n“If this is the case, I think I will sleep well tonight.”\n“I don’t think I will be able to sleep.”\n“Ahaha. Really? Because of me?”\n“Yes.”\nWhen she asked teasingly, I nodded without hesitation. As a result, a flush began to spread across her face.\n“How am I supposed to sleep if you say that all at once? I won't be able to sleep tonight....”\n“Are you feeling nervous too?”\n“Yes.”\n“… … Shall I sing you a lullaby?”\n“That's something I should be doing for you, shouldn't it?”\nHowever, she provocatively replied with a flushed face.\n“Oh, dear. It's better to postpone that for later. I might just end up attacking you.”\n“It's okay even if you do attack me.”\nI almost lost my reasoning at those words, but… … I barely manage to hold back. I couldn't give in to her provocation. It was not yet the time.\nEven if she allowed it, I didn't think I should and could accept it myself.\n\"...I'll just pretend I didn't hear that.\"\n“You know, Physis.”\n“Yes.”\n\"From now on, every day, I'll provoke you like this. It's been 8 months...no, now it's 7 months. Every day for 7 months.\"\n“Are you going to test me?”\n\"Yes. If you show any weakness, I'll attack you, so please endure it. I'll endure it too.\"\n\"....I'll try my best.\"\nAfter that, she and I had a little conversation and then went back to our rooms right away.\n'Darn it. Looks like I won't be able to sleep tonight either.'\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\nClosing the door, I threw myself onto the bed... and recalled the things I said to Physis today.\nWords that were meant to provoke him. Words that I threw at him, words I'd never said before.\nThinking about those words made me feel embarrassed, but I couldn't afford to be ashamed right now.\nThere will be countless other women who would target him, and I could lose him to any one of them in a moment's inattention.\nTherefore… …to prevent that from happening, I would continue to provoke him. I would make him look at me more and more, even if it was just once.\nDuring this time, I would learn more about him and strengthen my heart. We must not suspect each other, even under external pressure.\nThat way, even if we faced difficulties after we were married, we could trust and rely on each other.\nSeven months... A long or short time, depending on how one looked at it. I wondered how much trust I could build with him.\nI was curious and excited.\nMy heart was racing and I was covered in anticipation for the future.\nHe must be thinking of me right now too, right? I couldn't be happier knowing that he couldn't sleep because of me.\nIn the future, I hope that I would have the largest share in his mind more than anyone else. And when we finally got married, I hoped that we would have an unshakable trust in each other.\nI only wished for that.\n“Hehe.”\nAs I vaguely imagined the scene, I couldn't help but laugh out loud with joy.\nI hoped that day would come soon.\n* * *\n[Physis' POV]\nIn the end, I couldn't sleep. It was not like I was someone who got tired from only missing a day of sleep, but Adilun's continued provocative behavior over the past few days was enough to drive me crazy.\nAll night I could only think of her. On the contrary, the more she behaved like that, the less sure I became.\nShe was so much kindness to me... Could I really repay her properly?\n'No.'\nI shook my head.\nI shouldn't be thinking like this. If she was kind to me, then I should also show her the appropriate kindness.\nAs we exchanged kindness with each other, the trust would eventually form, and we would have to overcome countless hardships to come based on that trust.\nAccording to the flow of the story I saw… … Sooner or later, a change would occur in the North. A legion of numerous demon beasts invading the ice wall of Rodenov.\nHaving grown up eating human malice, they would grow stronger as the world would become more chaotic. Given the already chaotic situation of the empire, they would definitely invade the north.\n'I will have to prepare.'\nThat was not all. The situation with Crocus Duke and the ominous east, and the situation with Tallet Ram, a barbarian country beyond Ortear, was also imminent. If Tallet Ram invades Ortair, the aftermath of a fierce war could also trigger an epidemic.\nNone of the hardships that awaited us in the future could be taken lightly.\nSo I hoped. I hoped that she and I could firmly armor ourselves with trust in each other until the end of our lives and overcome the hardships to reach a happy ending.\nTo do so, I needed to become stronger myself. To be able to protect her. To be able to protect our happiness.\nAs dawn broke and the dawn slowly began to shine, I made that promise while looking at it.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "65 – Everyday\n[Physis' POV]\nMy daily routine remained the same after that day.\nEvery day, I practiced and trained myself. Just like before, I repeated sparring with knights in the training ground endlessly.\nOf course, now that my skills had improved significantly, rather than sparring with a single knight, quite a number of knights attacked me at once.\nAfter the intense sparring session finally came to an end, I took a moment to assess my condition, before lying down on the training ground to catch my breath.\nHowever, my peaceful rest was abruptly interrupted as the training ground suddenly became noisy.\nCurious about what was happening, I raised my upper body for a moment and saw Adilun appearing on the training ground.\nAdilun’s popularity in Ortaire was beyond imagination.\nHer beautiful appearance aside, what was most noteworthy was that she was able to reform me, who was known as the ortaire's troublemaker.\nIn addition, her kind attitude towards people below her had become a factor that made her popular with servants, maids, and knights alike.\nAs she approached me while floating in the air with magic, carrying a basket, she eventually settled down next to me on the training ground and gently placed the basket near her.\n\"Uh, Adilun? What brings you here?\"\nFeeling surprised I asked her because it was the first time she had come to visit me during my training.\n“I just came here because I was bored and had nothing to do. Is that not allowed?\"\n\"That's not the case. You are always welcome here.\"\nAt my answer, she smiled in satisfaction.\n“Then I will come every day. Oh, aren’t you hungry right now?”\n\"I'm a little hungry, and my throat is also dry. I was thinking of going to the kitchen for a bit to eat something.\"\n\"Hehe, then I'm glad I brought something for you.\"\nShe laughed innocently and took out food, water, and a cloth of a suitable size from the mysterious basket she had brought along.\nI just couldn't understand the purpose of the cloth, so I asked her.\n“Well? What's this cloth for?”\n“I thought you would be sweaty because of your training, so it would be good to wipe off your sweat first. And see, you're all sweaty now.\"\n\"Oh, I see. Then could you give me that cloth?\"\n\"No, I'll wipe it off for you.\"\nShe smiled mischievously and started wiping my body herself.\n“Ah, Adilun?”\n\"Just stay still. Don't fidget.\"\n“No, but… …There are a lot of eyes watching us right now.”\nI couldn't help but be surprised by her daring actions since the knights were staring at us with wide eyes.\n\"What's wrong with that?\"\nI felt the gaze around us becoming more and more intense. But she paid no attention to the gaze and wiped my body with a cloth she brought, before handing me some water.\nShe leaned close to my ear as she handed me the water and whispered quietly.\n\"To be honest, I could have cleaned you with magic, but I wanted to do it this way at least once.\"\nWatching her throw out those words and smile softly… …made me wonder if she was actually a fox, not a dragon.\nI felt my face getting hot without realizing it.\nIt wasn't just that.\n\"Here you go.\"\nShe even put the food she had prepared into my mouth herself, and every time she did, she sent a dizzying smile to me. I realized that she had made up her mind.\nSomehow... since we had talked under the moonlight the night before, it seemed that something had changed in her.\nOf course, I didn't dislike it.\nI didn’t hate or dislike it, but… … If I saw her reaching out to me like this, could I really keep my promise not to touch her for the seven months we had agreed upon?\nAnd the knights who saw her like this looked at me as if they would kill me right away. Of course, Adilun continued to chatter next to me, whether they said anything or not.\nWhen the tension of the situation began to become unbearable, Adilun took me out of the training ground.\n\"Hehe. Did I surprise you?\"\n\"Honestly...I was a little surprised. You never came to see me when I was practicing, did you? Not even in Rodenov.\"\n\"That's right. But...there's nothing I can do right now, and it's not easy to practice magic, so there's nothing else to do.\"\n\"Well, you really have nothing to do. The library is smaller than Rodenov's anyway.\"\n\"Yes. That's true. Anyway, I just wanted to see you in person. I'll keep doing that from now on.\"\n“Is that so?”\n“Yes… … As long as I’m here at Ortaire, I’ll stick with you. So that… … The stray cats won’t pay attention.”\nHer last words were a little muffled, but to my ears, whose hearing was quite developed, her last words were heard very clearly. At the same time, lust began to rise in me, but I managed to hold it back.\nIn fact, the reason I was pouring my efforts into training from today on was not only to become stronger but also because I couldn't stand the thought of Adilun sticking to me all day and talking about those things. But of course, she would come to the training ground when she was bored.\nAt this rate, I might not last a few days, let alone 7 months without getting into an accident.\nI started to become really scared. Of course, Adilun was probably aiming for that.\nIt seemed that she sincerely wanted to tie me to her side and not even give a glance to other women.\nOf course, I didn't hate that. No, I even wanted to tie Adilun to my side. To not go anywhere and just looked at me beside her.\nBut if I did that, I would end up harming her in some way, so I just kept it as a secret desire. I wanted her to be happy and to build a normal relationship with her as a couple.\nA relationship where we only had eyes for each other might seem very romantic at first glance, but eventually, even that romanticism was bound to break.\nThere would definitely be parts of each other that didn't fit, and even if one endure those parts, the cracks in the relationship would not change. That was why, if I wanted to be with her, I would have to think of a way to make her truly happy, rather than indulging in this secret desire.\nAfter going around Ortaire Castle with her like that, I went into the room, took a nap, and woke up… … Before I knew it, the fact that Adilun visited the training ground and acted affectionately with me spread throughout the castle.\nDuring dinner time, my father, mother, and older brother all looked at me and Adilun with excited faces, and I broke into a cold sweat at the gaze of my family.\nBut Adilun...actually seemed to enjoy those stares.\n“I heard an interesting story today.”\n“Gulp.”\nIt was just at the moment when my father said those words as he was drinking water, that I couldn't help but overhear.\n\"Are you okay?\"\nFurthermore, as I looked at Adilun next to me, who was looking at me with a worried expression, the smile of my family became even more intense...I had a feeling that this dinner was going to be quite uncomfortable.\n'What are they going to say?'\n\"As their relationship seems to be good, it feels satisfying just to watch them.\"\n“How about speeding up the ceremony?”\nWhen my father said one more thing, my brother intervened and 'helped me' with his words.\n“No, brother. Isn’t that too soon?”\n“The earlier the better. Right Physis?”\nWhen I responded hesitantly, Adilun smiled and said to my family.\n\"Oh my. Giltheon. Shouldn't we listen when they're talking so much about it?\"\n“…”\nMy mother smiled as if enjoying Adilun's such appearance, and around that time I started to sweat on my back.\n\"Ahaha. I'm just kidding. As Physis said... Isn’t that too early now? We need to get to know each other a little more and have a ceremony... I guess we’ll have to wait a little longer until then.”\nAs if satisfied with Adilun's answer, my family looked at the two of us and started throwing words at us.\nSince when did they become so close, do you two were close even in Rodenov too… … questions like this, filled the dining room.\nAdilun and I answered those stories wholeheartedly, and fortunately, the family, whose curiosity was somewhat satisfied, did not make any more annoying jokes to us.\nAfter dinner, we came out of the dining room and headed to our respective rooms.\nHer room was right next to mine, so the paths to it naturally overlapped.\nI looked at Adilun and tried to say that I was startled, but when I saw her face flushed red, I said nothing and took her hand.\nIt must have been quite embarrassing for her to say such bold words to my family.\n“Hehe.”\nBefore long, she held my hand tightly as well and suddenly began to blush even more\n“As expected, it’s a bit embarrassing to tell the count and the countess directly.”\n“Honestly, I think you were too bold. What would have happened if really sped up?”\n“Then we can just get married. Does Physis really hate marrying me?”\nShe gave me a slightly sullen expression, and I hurriedly shook my head at her, startled.\n“How can I? It's just… … It’s because I’m not ready.”\n“Why? You can just do it.”\n“It’s true that I am new to marriage and things like that, but at least I do know that a wedding is the most special day in both man's and a woman’s life. It is not possible to have such a wedding without proper preparation. Moreover, in order for my marriage and yours to be happier, we will need to develop more trust in each other.”\n“Uh, um… …Yes.”\nAt my sincere reply, her blushing face began to redden even more. She finally let go of my hand and spoke to me.\n\"Well, then, I'll go in now.\"\n\"Yes. Rest well, Adilun.\"\nI watched as she went into her room in front of me, and I tried to go into my room, but suddenly Adilun, who was trying to go into her room, turned and hugged me tightly.\n“Adilun?”\n“… …Ha-ha. This is the end of today’s quota. See you tomorrow. If you think of me later at night, you can sneak into my room. Of course, then… …You know?”\nShe laughed mischievously like a fox, and before I could get my confused mind under control, she stormed into her room and left.\nI had no choice but to go into my room as if possessed.\nSomehow, as the days went by, Adilun started to become more and more frightening.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "66: Picnic (1)\n[Physis' POV]\nAfter Adilun gave her bold answers to my family, her behavior changed even more aggressively.\nNow it wasn't just limited to training. Whatever I did, she always moved with me, occasionally holding my hand, clasping our hand, or linking arms with me.\nEspecially when maids or servants were nearby, this tendency became more pronounced, as if boasting everywhere that this person was mine.\nIt was not that I disliked these actions. No, I was overflowing with happiness. However, if there was a problem, it was that every time that happened, my heart would skip a beat and my desire for her would intensify.\nDue to Adilune's increasing seduction, I even started abstaining from alcohol altogether. I wasn't the type to enjoy drinking, but I used to drink occasionally to change my mood...But ever since Adilun came to Ortaire, I hadn't touched alcohol at all.\nI couldn't afford to waste the time I had patiently endured by drinking for no reason.\nAt first glance, the change in Adilun felt dramatic. But now I felt like I knew a little bit about her. Her proactive and reckless nature must be a part of her original personality.\nI didn't know that my change would bring such happiness to her. If I looked at her recently, there were moments when I suddenly burst into laughter.\nHow could I hate her, and how could I not love her when she confidently showed off her charms to me?\nBut that was why I had to be even more careful.\nEven in my past life, it was the same. I had seen countless people ruin their relationships with their loved ones by showing their worst sides. So, I knew all too well how it leads to a downfall.\nLove isn't just about expressing your feelings towards someone in a one-sided manner. It was about building trust with each other... and on that trust, forming a strong foundation of support for each other, this is what love is.\nLove is about respecting each other, listening to each other's desires, and sometimes even compromising for each other happiness.\nAt least, that was my definition of love. So, I needed to act accordingly to the love that I desired.\nThat was why I couldn't afford to waver even once. Adilun's temptation might become stronger, and there might be times when it would be difficult to resist it... but I mustn't give in.\nI knew myself too well. The moment I give in to Adilun's temptation, everything I had promised myself would scatter like bubbles, and I would be consumed by the existence of her, forgetting everything that I needed to do.\nIt was not like I didn't want it, but she said it herself that it was her tests, so I wanted to not fail her.\nShe was a deadly existence. Perhaps, once I fall for her, I won't be able to escape. So, I had to be vigilant.\nAt any moment, I might unknowingly be led by her and fall into her trap.\nThe scariest thing was, she might be planning it all along.\n'Let’s always keep my composure. should never go over.'\n'Let's remember: trust and affection must go hand in hand.'\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\nI knew I had become quite bold. However, I didn't expect to become this bold.\nUntil now, even if I had something I wanted, it was rare for me to reach out first.\nBecause I felt like I was going to get hurt. Things like my dragon scales prevented me from reaching for anything first.\nBut was it because the scales were gone? It was as if I had untied the chains that bound my very existence.\nI was able to actively show interest in Physis, whom I wouldn't have approached before... The released chains must have played a part.\nIt was fortunate that my revealed appearance was beautiful. To obtain what I wanted, I had to use everything I had.\nThe more I attempted to seduce him... the more I found myself being attracted to him instead. It might have seemed like I was the one tempting him, but in reality, I was the one who was tempted.\nIt was as if some fate was pulling me towards him, and every time I saw him, my body burned with desires, and I could see myself wanting him.\nThe reason I was given seven months was because of that. If I didn't make such a promise, I felt like I would be buried in him at some point and become an idiot who couldn’t think of anything else.\nI didn't know that love could be so frightening. It felt like I was losing myself every time I saw him.\nThe problem was that the fear of being consumed by that love was causing me intense ecstasy. Every time I thought of him, I was thrilled, and I was so into him that I wanted to kiss him every time I saw his face.\nRight now, to the extent, if he were to come to me tonight... I would want to give myself entirely to him without hesitation.\nI thought it would not be difficult to endure it. Because most of my life had been directly related to perseverance.\nHowever... this was too difficult.\nEven though it was a situation where I could easily reach out and seize what I wanted most, even though it was a situation where I could forget everything in the sweetness of it all, I had no choice but to endure endlessly so as not to do so.\nThe sensation in my body, which increased every day, became sharper, and whenever I thought of him in my head, I indulged in impudent delusions.\nThese seven months would be like an eternity\nBut after those seven months have passed, a trust as strong as eternity would linger by our side.\nThis was not a mere guess. I would make it so.\nDuring the last National Foundation Day, didn't I realize who I am? I am arrogant, conceited, and a strong-willed dragon. I must seize what I desired, and if I had sworn to something, I must keep it.\nTherefore... the covenant that I made with him for those seven months must also be kept.\n“Haaah… …”\nHowever, despite knowing that fact, restless breath escapes me. Perhaps tonight would be terribly long.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThe next day, I woke up with groggy eyes because I had fallen asleep very late.\nDeep down, I had hoped that he would come to my room, but as expected, he must have exerted his superhuman patience because he did not come to my room.\nI felt both regretful and relieved, and I also had conflicting thoughts about whether I should reduce my daring actions to provoke him, while at the same time, I had thoughts on how to seduce him today.\nSo, I was filled with contradictory thoughts.\nBut fortunately, ever since we arrived at the Ortaire estate, there had been no maids or servants who looked at him with admiring eyes or showed any interest in him. In fact, some people didn't even spare a glance at him, perhaps because they had already been impressed by my previous performance at the count’s family.\nIt was better that way. There was no need to waste energy on unnecessary monitoring. I had to use the remaining energy to prove that he was mine.\nSo... I followed him closely and carried out various acts of affection.\nIt was amazing that I could even behave like this, but I couldn't help feeling embarrassed.\nHowever, I ignored the embarrassment and felt the rising happiness.\nReorganizing my various worries and contemplations within me was good, but just being with him and walking around like this made something thrilling pulse in my heart.\nPerhaps this thrill would change into something else as we continue to be together. However, if it was based on the foundation of trust, it would become something richer than love.\nThat was why I endured like this...\nAnyway, he was dedicated to his training today as well. When asked what he was training so hard for, he replied:\n“Because you never know what will happen. It is to prepare for that time. When we return to Rodenov later… … In conjunction with Sir Lucas, I have decided to start joint training with the knights.”\n“Oh, really?”\n\"Yes. It's still okay for now, but I have a bad feeling about something. I feel like something might happen. So we should be prepared. There's no movement from the central side yet... but it won't hurt to be prepared.\"\n\"I see. By the way, do you have any plans after training today?\"\n\"No, not really.\"\n\"Then, would you like to come on a picnic with me? It's near the wheat field.\"\n\"Oh, since the weather is good today, that's fine. Okay. Anyway, the training will end around lunchtime... so I'll coordinate with that.\"\n\"Great! Then I'll go and prepare for the picnic with Mina.\"\n\"I'll be looking forward to it.\"\nAs he smiled, I also smiled at him.\nToday, it wouldn't be a bad idea to try making a dish for him myself. I was pretty confident in my cooking skills.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

The moment I give in to Adilun's temptation, everything I had promised myself would scatter like bubbles, and I would be consumed by the existence of her, forgetting everything that I needed to do.\nIt was not like I didn't want it, but she said it herself that it were her tests, so I wanted to not fail her.\nShe was a deadly existence. Perhaps, once I fall for her, I won't be able to escape. So, I had to be vigilant.\nAt any moment, I might unknowingly be led by her and fall into her trap.\nThe scariest thing was, she might be planning it all along.\n'Let’s always keep my composure. should never go over.'\n'Let's remember: trust and affection must go hand in hand.'\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\nI knew I had become quite bold. However, I didn't expect to become this bold.\nUntil now, even if I had something I wanted, it was rare for me to reach out first.\nBecause I felt like I was going to get hurt. Things like my dragon scales prevented me from reaching for anything first.\nBut was it because the scales were gone? It was as if I had untied the chains that bound my very existence.\nI was able to actively show interest in Physis, whom I wouldn't have approached before... The released chains must have played a part.\nIt was fortunate that my revealed appearance was beautiful. To obtain what I wanted, I had to use everything I had.\nThe more I attempted to seduce him... the more I found myself being attracted to him instead. It might have seemed like I was the one tempting him, but in reality, I was the one who was tempted.\nIt was as if some fate was pulling me towards him, and every time I saw him, my body burned with desires, and I could see myself wanting him.\nThe reason I was given seven months was because of that. If I didn't make such a promise, I felt like I would be buried in him at some point and become an idiot who couldn’t think of anything else.\nI didn't know that love could be so frightening. It felt like I was losing myself every time I saw him.\nThe problem was that the fear of being consumed by that love was causing me intense ecstasy. Every time I thought of him, I was thrilled, and I was so into him that I wanted to kiss him every time I saw his face.\nRight now, to the extent, if he were to come to me tonight... I would want to give myself entirely to him without hesitation.\nI thought it would not be difficult to endure it. Because most of my life had been directly related to perseverance.\nHowever... this was too difficult.\nEven though it was a situation where I could easily reach out and seize what I wanted most, even though it was a situation where I could forget everything in the sweetness of it all, I had no choice but to endure endlessly so as not to do so.\nThe sensation in my body, which increased every day, became sharper, and whenever I thought of him in my head, I indulged in impudent delusions.\nThese seven months would be like an eternity\nBut after those seven months have passed, a trust as strong as eternity would linger by our side.\nThis was not a mere guess. I would make it so.\nDuring the last National Foundation Day, didn't I realize who I am? I am arrogant, conceited, and a strong-willed dragon. I must seize what I desired, and if I had sworn to something, I must keep it.\nTherefore... the covenant that I made with him for those seven months must also be kept.\n“Haaah… …”\nHowever, despite knowing that fact, restless breath escapes me. Perhaps tonight would be terribly long.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThe next day, I woke up with groggy eyes because I had fallen asleep very late.\nDeep down, I had hoped that he would come to my room, but as expected, he must have exerted his superhuman patience because he did not come to my room.\nI felt both regretful and relieved, and I also had conflicting thoughts about whether I should reduce my daring actions to provoke him, while at the same time, I had thoughts on how to seduce him today.\nSo, I was filled with contradictory thoughts.\nBut fortunately, ever since we arrived at the Ortaire estate, there had been no maids or servants who looked at him with admiring eyes or showed any interest in him. In fact, some people didn't even spare a glance at him, perhaps because they had already been impressed by my previous performance at the count’s family.\nIt was better that way. There was no need to waste energy on unnecessary monitoring. I had to use the remaining energy to prove that he was mine.\nSo... I followed him closely and carried out various acts of affection.\nIt was amazing that I could even behave like this, but I couldn't help feeling embarrassed.\nHowever, I ignored the embarrassment and felt the rising happiness.\nReorganizing my various worries and contemplations within me was good, but just being with him and walking around like this made something thrilling pulse in my heart.\nPerhaps this thrill would change into something else as we continue to be together. However, if it was based on the foundation of trust, it would become something richer than love.\nThat was why I endured like this...\nAnyway, he was dedicated to his training today as well. When asked what he was training so hard for, he replied:\n“Because you never know what will happen. It is to prepare for that time. When we return to Rodenov later… … In conjunction with Sir Lucas, I have decided to start joint training with the knights.”\n“Oh, really?”\n\"Yes. It's still okay for now, but I have a bad feeling about something. I feel like something might happen. So we should be prepared. There's no movement from the central side yet... but it won't hurt to be prepared.\"\n\"I see. By the way, do you have any plans after training today?\"\n\"No, not really.\"\n\"Then, would you like to come on a picnic with me? It's near the wheat field.\"\n\"Oh, since the weather is good today, that's fine. Okay. Anyway, the training will end around lunchtime... so I'll coordinate with that.\"\n\"Great! Then I'll go and prepare for the picnic with Mina.\"\n\"I'll be looking forward to it.\"\nAs he smiled, I also smiled at him.\nToday, it wouldn't be a bad idea to try making a dish for him myself. I was pretty confident in my cooking skills.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "[Physis' POV]\n“Physis.”\n“Yes?”\n“How about a glass of wine?”\nWhile I was enjoying the food prepared by Adilun, she quietly took out a bottle of wine, as if the moment had arrived.\n“That… … I'll pass.”\n“No, why?”\nUnder Adilun's subtle persuasion, I couldn't help but wave my hand.\n\"I feel like I might unintentionally make a mistake.\"\n\"What if you drink it while controlling yourself? Just one glass, let's create a pleasant atmosphere.\"\nAdilun suggested with a hint of excitement in her eyes, making it difficult for me to continue refusing. Besides, she had gone through the trouble of cooking for me, and declining to have even a single glass out of fear of losing control to drunkenness would be disrespectful to her.\n\"Well, then I'll have just one glass.\"\nAs the wine poured into the glass, it gradually filled up, and my heart started racing.\nOf course, one glass of wine wouldn't make me drunk, but it was evident that if I allowed myself to be carried away by the ambiance, I would certainly consume a considerable amount of wine.\nHowever, if I were to refuse Adilun's offer... that wouldn't be right either. I just had to drink it calmly, quickly put Adilun to sleep, and somehow maintain composure myself.\nI also poured a small amount of wine into Adilun's glass.\n\"Uh... why is there so little?\"\n\"...Adilun, your tolerance for alcohol is quite weak. We're here to enjoy a picnic, but it would be problematic if you got drunk.\"\n\"I-I'm not that weak to... t-that extent...\"\n\"Adilun, when you got drunk for the first time, you passed out after just a few glasses of wine. How much of a difference do you think there is between then and now?\"\n\"....Well, still, please pour a little more. I won't get drunk.\"\nAt Adilun's persistent request, I eventually ended up pouring wine into her glass.\nBecause it was wine... memories of our first kiss kept flooding my mind. Not the brief one from last time, but a prolonged, exploratory one.\nWe clinked our glasses together and began sipping the wine. However, there was one thing I had overlooked.\nAt first, I thought it was just a slightly strong wine, but after taking a sip, I was certain. This wine was the strongest among all the wines in the Castle.\nEven I, who had a considerable tolerance for alcohol, was beginning to feel a slight buzz. Needless to say, Adilun had no chance.\nI raised my head with a squeak and looked at Adilun.\nAs expected, my instincts were correct. Adilun's expression gradually relaxed, and a rosy flush spread across her face.\nIt was highly likely that one more drink would make her words start to slur.\nIf this state continued for too long, it could become troublesome. It would be better to put her to sleep quickly.\nWith that in mind, I asked Adilun.\n“Adilun? Are you okay?”\n\"Yes? Yes, I'm still okay. Hehe.\"\nWhether this was fortunate or unfortunate, she didn't seem completely intoxicated yet.\n\"But this alcohol... seems to be quite strong. It's better not to drink more, Adilun.\"\n\"Yes? Oh, no. I'm fine, so can't I have just one more glass?\"\n\"No, you can't. If you drink any more than this, something big will definitely happen.\"\n\"Something big? What do you mean?\"\n\"Well, it's... something embarrassing to talk about, yes. Those kinds of things.\"\nAs I spoke those words, my face turned red, and a smile began to form at the corners of Adilun's mouth, her eyes wide open.\n\"In that case, Physis can drink in my place. It's a waste if we don't drink the wine we just opened, right?\"\nImmediately, I realized Adilun's true intentions. She was attempting to get me drunk now. Moreover, judging by the alcohol content of this wine... even if I resisted, if I were to consume it all, I wouldn't be in a good condition either.\n'Is it truly alright to drink?'\n'No, would it really matter if I did drink?'\nThese two conflicting thoughts began to collide within me.\nAnd gradually... the thought that there wouldn't be any significant consequences if I drank started to prevail.\n'Even if I cross the line, as long as I don't forget my purpose... it's alright to give in to impulse once in a while. Adilun must surely be hoping for that.'\nI could hear the dark desires within me.\nI couldn't help but seriously consider it. Regarding physical love, if I took things slowly... wouldn't it be alright?\nHowever, upon reflection, I couldn't guarantee that I was taking things slowly. I was undeniably falling for her, to the extent that I might forget everything else and solely pursue her.\nWe were still in a situation where various threats targeted the empire, so there was a possibility that I would become engrossed in her and forget my purpose.\n'Let's prioritize. The order of the threats facing the empire.'\nFirst, there was the advance of the northern monsters. Due to the world becoming increasingly difficult to live in, the monsters grew stronger and breached the icy wall that protected the north. And when that happened, on top of the ice wall, a king who unified the monsters, known as the 'Demon King,' would appear.\nIf that happened, the North would suffer considerable damage.\n'Can I handle the Demon King with my own strength right now?'\n'No. My abilities haven't reached that level yet. So, I mustn't get too immersed in Adilun either.'\nThe feeling that it might be okay to cross the line weakened, and the feeling that I must restrain myself took a step forward.\nAfter organizing my thoughts, I tried to convey my intention of refusal to Adilun, but... Seeing her smile at me shattered my self-control.\n'Well, since I've come this far, what's wrong with having a drink? Just for today. Just for today.'\nAs if compelled by an irresistible force, I extended my glass, and Adilun generously poured wine into it.\n\"Um, Adilun?\"\n\"Hehe. Physis, please enjoy it all. Not a drop should be left.\"\n“… …Yes.”\nWith a somewhat resolute tone, I ended up giving my consent.\n'Sure. Let's see how drunk we can get.'\nAs Adilun eagerly poured wine into her glass and consumed it, at some point, I suppose I lost my senses and began pouring wine into my own glass, little by little... and drinking it.\nBefore I knew it, I was barely holding onto a hazy state of mind.\n'Hmm.'\n'What was I trying to do?'\nMy mind was so foggy that it was challenging to control my body properly. There was something... something I had to do.\nStraining to focus my blurred vision, I gazed ahead and caught sight of Adilun's figure.\n'Is it because of the alcohol? She looks even more beautiful than usual... Her allure captivates my gaze.'\nAdilun also smiled at me, it was a foxy smile. A smile that completely captures a person's mind.\nShe spoke to me.\n\"Don't you think we... have been restraining ourselves too much?\"\n\"...Yes.\"\n\"So, how about just for today, just for a day... we satisfy ourselves a little? Without crossing the line...\"\nI nodded my head blankly.\nI couldn't make a proper judgment.\nAs my consciousness faded, I suddenly became aware of Adilun's face drawing closer. Then, a gentle sensation lingered on my lips, and the sweet aroma of wine brushed past, exploring every corner of my mouth.\nThe sensation of our soft tongues intertwining, entangling... I became completely absorbed in that act.\n\"Mmm... Ahh.\"\nFor a brief moment, our lips parted, and I found myself entranced by her completely relaxed expression. Her golden eyes, captivating and seductive, drew me closer to her.\nUnconsciously, I found myself holding her chin, our lips meeting once again. The sweetness I had tasted a moment ago flooded my mouth, and our breaths, entwined in exploration, grew heavy.\n\"Mm, hmm...\"\nEven as the provocative sound of our tongues mingling echoed in my ears, my hazy mind was consumed by pleasure and unable to regain its composure.\nWith one hand still holding her chin, I pulled her closer, embraced her, and continued to explore her lips.\n\"Ah...\"\nFinally, as the long kiss came to an end, she took a deep breath and looked at me with hazy eyes. Just like me, she appeared quite intoxicated.\n“Once more… …”\nBut perhaps feeling that the previous long kiss was not sufficient, she pressed her lips against mine once again.\nThe process repeated itself, and I could feel her slightly exposed shoulders and flushed face growing even redder.\n\"Haah, haah...\"\nHot breath escaped from her mouth, and her touch moved to the back of my neck.\nOnce more, I embraced her, and for some reason, my gaze shifted not to her face, but to her horn.\nAdilun must have noticed my gaze because she spoke to me in a somewhat suggestive voice.\n\"Horns... You can touch them.\"\nI couldn't fathom why she wanted me to touch her horn, but I obliged her request. I gently stroked and caressed her smooth horn.\n\"Ha, Ahhh!\"\nIn an instant, a strong moan reverberated in my ears. Despite the haze clouding my mind, it was evident what had caused her outburst.\nHer horn.\nPerhaps her horn played a role in arousing her.\nThe moment I heard her strong moan, an intense desire arose within me to elicit an even stronger reaction from her. I straightened my teeth, gnawed one horn of Adilun with my teeth, and ran my hand over her other horn. As if touching the most precious thing.\n“Ah, ah… … Ha Ahaaaaa!”\nHer hazy eyes shot open, and a more powerful moan escaped her lips. But that wasn't all. As if electrified, her body trembled.\nUnable to withstand the overwhelming stimulation, her dazed eyes gradually began to close.\nAs the strength drained from her body and she leaned on me, I too gave myself over to the alcohol and leaned against the tree behind me… … and fell asleep.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "[Adilun's POV]\nThe first thing I saw when I opened my eyes was Physis, who had fallen asleep leaning against a tree, and me nestled in his embrace.\n'I must have fallen asleep while drinking with Physis.'\nEven though he was asleep, he held me tightly. Fortunately, not much time seemed to have passed yet as the sun was still shining brightly.\nI watched his sleeping figure. Come to think of it, it felt like I had never seen him asleep like this before.\nNo matter how many times I looked at it, his face was truly handsome. If his face had been ordinary one, the princesses wouldn’t have been so twisted.\nI gently caressed his face and kissed his lips. Lightly, like a bird landing on a branch, I savored his soft lips and repeated the process.\nWas it because I entrusted my body to him and let him hold me in his hands that an indescribable pleasure struck me? Just by looking at him, I couldn't help but feel an affection that was irresistibly drawn to him.\n'I should have just crossed the line.'\nPerhaps saying the words 'seven months' was unnecessary.\nHowever, I had no regrets. The more I endured, the more special and passionate our love would be when we would finally come together.\nOriginally, it was when one obtained something they intensely desired that they derived the greatest satisfaction.\nRather, it might be fortunate that I could have some time to build up my mind and stamina separately. He was already a skilled knight who was not far behind Sir Lucas, the best knight in the northern region.\nTo share love with someone like him, I, too, need to build up my stamina considerably. When I returned to Rodenov this time, I must ask him to train me in basic physical endurance.\nHow many times did I kiss his lips and caress his cheek?\nHis eyes seemed to tremble slightly.\n\"Um...\"\nPhysis opened his eyes with a soft moan. His eyes were slightly hazy, indicating that the alcohol's effects hadn't completely worn off yet, but he didn't seem to be completely disoriented like before.\n\"Are you awake?\"\n\"Adilun?\"\n\"Yes. I guess I gave you too much alcohol after all.\"\nInstantly, his face turned bright red. He must have recalled what we did before falling asleep. When I saw him like that, I could feel the heat rushing to my face as well.\nBecause when I saw his face, the sensation I felt earlier passed through my body again.\nI was overflowing with affection, so I acted excessively without realizing it. However, I didn't regret those actions.\nIt was embarrassing, yes. But the happiness I felt from the fact that I was able to share even a little bit of affection with him was greater than that embarrassment.\nI never knew that his gentle touch on my body could arouse such excitement and joy.\nJust by touching horns and exchanging kisses, if it was like this... I could imagine what would happen when we truly cross the line. It was a foregone conclusion.\nI wished that time would come quickly, and my body started to tingle. I couldn't even imagine that I would desire Physis this much, but that was how unpredictable human affairs were.\nIf I were to show my current self to the me from a year ago... I could already hear myself asking if I'd gone crazy.\nEventually, Physis, who came to his senses completely, was just staring at me blankly without saying a word. His eyes were hazy, as if he was dreaming.\nSurely, he must be recalling the actions we shared earlier.\n“Physis?”\n“Ah, yes. Adilun.”\nA mischievous thought came to my mind, so I asked him directly.\n“This kiss, how was it?”\n\"...It was, goo-good.\"\n\"To the extent that you want to do more?\"\nIt was so adorable to see how his face turned red and he stammered in an embarrassed voice.\n\"Yes. But... I had to hold back. If I were to fall for you right here, I wouldn't be able to control myself.\"\n\"Hehe.\"\nHearing those words, a sense of happiness filled my heart even more, and a bright laughter naturally lingered on my lips. I was so happy that he desired me, and I was also happy because I felt the same way.\nAt that moment, a good idea came to my mind.\n“Then why don’t we do it like this, Physis?”\n“What do you mean?”\n\"From now on, we won't cross the line. But sometimes, desires can become too intense, right?\"\n“Yes. To be honest, I haven’t been able to sleep properly lately. You tempt me, Adilune...\"\n\"Ahahaha. That's really pleasing to hear. Of course, I feel the same. Physis, whenever I see you, my heart races, I don't know what to do, and I want to kiss you for hours. But we can't do that.\"\n\"Yes.\"\n“Therefore… … Sometimes. When it’s really hard for each other to endure, how about letting each other’s desires go as far as possible without crossing the line like today?”\n“Wouldn’t that be rather dangerous?”\n“It’s dangerous, but… … I think it would be more dangerous if we continued to endure it. If we don't release these desires at least to some extent, I might end up clinging to you for days on end. And I'm sure I would definitely get pregnant. Yes, I won't let go.\"\nI shamelessly spoke words that were too embarrassing to me for even mention. If I didn't speak like this, it seemed like he wouldn't listen. Holding onto such lingering thoughts, I eventually felt that someday we would cross the line, becoming intimately involved.\nI didn't know I would reveal myself to this extent.\nNo, rather than revealing myself, it might be because I love him to that extent and always harbor a desire to become one with him.\n\"I- I understand... Adilun, do as you wish. Since we're already engaged, there's no one who would object. They might find it strange if we didn't have a relationship despite being engaged... It seems like a good way to dispel any doubts.\"\n\"Yes. So, sometimes, when I call you, please come to me. It's a promise?\"\n“Yes! I’ll keep that in mind…”\nHe replied to me in a slightly suppressed voice. He seemed to have accumulated something deep inside. If I get the chance later, I should find a way to fulfill his desires as he fulfills mine.\n'Yes. Let's definitely do it.'\n\"Should we go back now? It's about time.\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Oh, before we go back...\"\nI immediately hugged him by the neck and kissed him. We won't be able to openly engage in such behavior when we returned to Ortaire, so we should take full advantage of it here.\nAs if he felt sorry for that, he responded enthusiastically to my kiss. Holding my head, playing with my tongue, sometimes running through my gums… … intertwine each other’s tongues\nAs expected, no matter how many times I think about it, there was no happier moment than this moment of sharing affection with him. I hoped I didn't become overly accustomed to this happiness.\nMay every day be filled with this freshness.\nThat was all I wished for.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nAfter returning to the castle from the dreamy picnic, Mina greeted me and asked:\n\"How did it go, Miss? How far did you progress?\"\n\"Well, we kissed...\"\nMina's expression instantly showed a mix of surprise and disappointment.\n\"Just a kiss? I thought you would come back covered in kiss marks or something... Isn't it a waste to let such a good opportunity slip away, Miss?\"\n“Still, progress has been made.”\nI replied to Mina in a rather confident tone.\n“Progress?”\n\"Yes. At the very least, I secured some insurance so that those who try to pursue him won't easily snatch him away.\"\n“Then I’m glad.”\n\"Yes, it is.\"\nAs I smiled, Mina couldn't help but let out a laughter as if she had no choice.\n\"Haha, Miss.\"\n“Yes?”\n\"You seem really happy these days. It's clearly evident from your expression, and it even radiates light just by looking at you.\"\n\"Is that so?\"\n\"Yes. So please don't miss your chance with Sir Physis. I hope things go well for both of you.\"\n\"Thanks.”\n\"By the way, how long do you plan to stay in Ortaire?\"\n\"Well, I want to stay a little longer. It gives me a cozy feeling that's different from Rodenov.\"\n\"In that case, I will follow your wishes for as long as you want.\"\n“Yes.”\n\"Oh, by the way, what is Sir Physis doing now?\"\n\"Well, I'm not sure. But it seems like he went to his room. He must be tired after all... I think I made him drink too much.\"\n\"You made him drink?\"\n\"Yes. Why? Didn't we have that wine the chef boasted about having the highest alcohol content? I used that one.\"\n\"Oh, that one? But still, Sir Physis didn't make a move on you?\"\n\"No. He restrained himself until the end.\"\n\"Wow... That shows extraordinary patience.\"\n\"Yes, right? I actually liked that about him.\"\n\"Is that so?\"\n\"Yes. Even if someone tempted him and made him drink, he wouldn't give in. I gained confidence in that. Maybe with these kinds of convictions, trust towards each other will be built.\"\n\"That makes sense.\"\n\"So... I'll wait a little longer. Until the promised day.\"\n\"The promised day?\"\n\"Yes. It's a secret. You'll find out naturally later.\"\nWith a smile on my face as I spoke, Mina nodded her head, indicating that she understood.\n\"I understand, Miss. Well then, I'll take my leave now. Rest well.\"\n\"Yes. You rest well too.\"\nAs soon as Mina left, I flopped onto the bed. Then, I gently stroked the horn that he had touched today.\nAs expected, I didn't feel anything.\nCould it be because it was touched by someone I love? Even when Princess Lobelia touched it before, I didn't feel anything.\nIn fact, the reason I asked him to touch the horn today was because of the thrilling sensation I felt when he touched my horn before.\nI wanted to confirm if that sensation was simply an illusion.\nHowever, that sensation was not a simple illusion. It seemed like my guess was correct. Perhaps, because I love him, every time he touches my horn, I experience the utmost pleasure.\n'Wait a moment. Does that mean I have already held feelings for him since then?'\nAlthough I realized it much later... it seemed that was indeed the case.\nUnable to control the laughter that kept welling up on my face, I buried my face in the bed and tossed around.\nWhile contemplating how I could seduce him tomorrow.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

Perhaps it was her way of showing trust. It had only been a few days since we came to Ortaire, and she was already making such bold provocations, which gradually made me uneasy.\nI was afraid I would impregnate her before the wedding.\nAs the days passed, all I had left was patience. Whenever I looked at her, who became more and more desirable every day, it was not difficult to see that she was deliberately tempting me.\nIn fact, now it seemed like Adilun was not actually a dragon but a fox or maybe a succubus?\nPerhaps that was why tempting me like that… …No it must be because she hopes I won't be swayed.\nMoreover, there was the suggestion Adilun made in the end.\nIf it became too difficult to endure, she told me to come find her.\nSomehow... it might not be long before I secretly visit Adilun's bed.\n\"Ugh...\"\nUnknowingly, a stifled moan escaped from me. Frankly, it was my limit. I wondered if I could endure for a few more days.\nAt this point, even if my fiancée was too adorable, it was a problem. I desperately wished.\n'Please, tempt me in moderation.'\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThe day was bright. My family asked what happened during the picnic yesterday, but I just smiled awkwardly and avoided the question.\n\"Nothing really happened.\"\n\"Considering how drunk you were... Wouldn't it be better to have the ceremony quickly? Of course, it's true that you and Princess Rodenov didn't have a good relationship for the past year of your engagement, but now that you both like each other so much, is there any reason to delay the ceremony? It has even been a year since you got engaged.\"\nThere was nothing I could say to my mother's words. In fact, our relationship seemed like a sweet engagement to others.\nOur relationship had been good enough recently that it wouldn't be strange to go on a honeymoon right away.\n\"If it's good for both of you, I’ll talk to Rodenov separately. I think they would be happy too... Didn’t they also see that the two of you had a very good relationship?”\n“It is true, but… … That's why I want to postpone it a little more.\"\n\"Why? Tell me the reason in detail.\"\n\"It’s true that we get along well, but I still don’t know much about Adilun. We only spend just a few months together and I don't think that this is enough, If it was just dating, I wouldn't mind, but... Marriage and dating are different. I think we need to know each other better in order to care for each other and understand each other more. And right now, Adilun and I are getting to know each other and building that trust. I think if we rush, it could harm our relationship. I'm not saying I need years, I'm not an idiot, but just a little more time will be good enough.\"\nMy mother listened to my words and widened her eyes as if questioning if those were truly mine.\n“Oh, my goodness. I didn't expect you to say something like that... You genuinely have feelings for Princess Rodenov.”\n\"...Yes.\"\n\"I understand. From now on, I won't say anything about your relationship. Just go in the direction that seems most ideal to both of you.\"\n\"Yes, Mother.\"\n\"Now, I don't need to worry about you anymore. It's such a relief.\"\n\"Haha... I did cause quite a lot of trouble.\"\n\"Rather than being upset because of you, it's really better that you're behaving so well now. It's better to regain your senses later than to cause more problems later on.\"\n\"That's true. But, Mother.\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"What about my older brother... Is there any news about him? Engagement or dating, for example.\"\nUpon hearing those words, my mother sighed.\n\"Ha... I don't know either. Who will Huian end up with... He’s a child with no flaws, yet strangely, he has no connections with women. Even if I try to introduce someone, he just keeps rejecting.\"\n\"Is that so? Well... I'm sure he'll handle it on his own.\"\n\"But it still makes me uneasy that he doesn't even have an engagement partner.\"\n\"He is my older brother 'Huian'. I don't think you need to worry too much about him.\"\n“Haa. I’m not sure. I'm just glad that at least you seem to be doing well.\"\n“Hahaha…”\n“Anyway, I’m planning to enjoy tea time with Adilun later, will you come too?”\n“No. I’m just thinking of going to the training ground.”\n\"Is that so? Alright.\"\n“Then have a good time with Adilun, Mother.”\n\"You don't have to tell me, I already planned on doing that.\"\n\"Haha. Yes, I was worrying for no reason.\"\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\nI headed to Ortaire’s garden because Countess had called for me. Curious about the reason, I went and she simply said she wanted to have tea time.\nAs I entered the garden, a refreshing scent different from the winter garden filled the air. The overall atmosphere was warm and welcoming, unlike the chilly ambiance of the winter garden, giving off a completely different feeling.\nEven though I had been here once before, it seemed that the charm of this unfamiliar scenery didn't easily fade away.\n\"Welcome, Adilun.\"\n“Hello, madam.”\nCountess greeted me with a bright smile on her lips. Every time I saw her, her smile always put me at ease, and it felt comforting to be welcomed with a smile each time.\n\"Did you enjoy the picnic yesterday?\"\n\"Yes, it was a delightful picnic.\"\nI smiled and took a sip of the tea personally prepared by her.\n\"So, how far have things progressed between Physis and you?\"\n“Cough!”\nHowever, as soon as I took a sip of tea, I unintentionally choked upon hearing the Countess's question.\n\"Cough, cough!\"\n\"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't expect such a strong reaction...\"\n\"Oh, no, it's my fault. I apologize for being impolite...\"\n\"I wouldn't call it impolite. But judging by your reaction... I suppose things have progressed quite far.\"\n\"...Y-yes.\"\n\"Hehe, I see. Well, I won't pry any further since it could be a bit uncomfortable. However, there's one thing I would like to ask. Princess Adilun Rodenov.\"\n“Yes.”\n“Do you want to marry Physis right away? If the princess nods, I’m thinking of holding the ceremony right away, even if it means persuading Physis.”\nMarriage. Honestly, I expected this topic to come up by now. It had been about a year and a half since Physis and I became engaged.\nConsidering that most princesses usually wait about half a year after the engagement before getting married... my marriage was indeed becoming overly delayed.\nOver the past year, our relationship was worse than others. If Physis hadn't changed, our engagement would surely have been broken.\nBut now, the situation was completely opposite to back then. We respected and loved each other. That much was certain.\nWe hadn't confessed our feelings or engaged in a physical relationship... but it was undoubtedly a relationship where we could consider ourselves lovers.\nTo be honest, it would be a lie to say I didn’t feel the same way.\nBut… … I had decided. The upcoming seven months were a time when we had to firmly build trust in each other.\nSo, marriage was still too early.\nI concluded that and shook my head.\n\"No, it's still too early for marriage. Thank you for your concern, madam.\"\n\"I see. I understand. It's fortunate that both of you seem to have the same thoughts.\"\n\"...Yes.\"\n\"It feels new. To think that two people who had such a strained relationship could become this close, I, and even my husband, didn't expect it. I wondered if it was our greed that caused pain to both of you... Thank you so much again, Adilun, for forgiving Physis.\"\nThe Countess spoke while looking into the distance.\n\"Thank you for thinking that way.\"\n\"I worried a lot and hoped that the relationship between you two would improve, but when it actually became a reality, I'm at a loss for words. Our Physis, please scold him sharply when he makes mistakes. My future daughter-in-law, Princess Rodenov.\"\nThe Countess smirked mischievously, but her gaze still remained in the distance.\n\"Yes. But I think I'll make more mistakes.\"\n\"That's okay. That child has made far more mistakes. So, I hope your future is filled with blessings. Don't cheat on each other, just look at each other... I hope you have such a life. Oh, you don't need to worry about Physis cheating.\"\n\"Really? Is that so?\"\n\"Yes. That child has never been interested in women, even when he reached the age to be attracted to them.\"\n\"I see...\"\n\"But still, hold onto him tightly just in case. He probably won't be able to resist your words. I never thought that child would be capable of loving someone... I'm just grateful that it turned out this way.\"\nI also gazed in the direction the Countess was looking and honestly replied.\n\"Yes. I'll keep that in mind. And I'll do my best to live the way you suggested.\"\n\"That's all I ask. Ah, but... I still want to see a child between you two soon.\"\n\"Ah...\"\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\n\"....Ahaha... wh... Hahaha...\"\nI couldn't bring myself to say anything to her words, so all I could do was let out an awkward laugh.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "[Physis' POV]\nThe time in Ortaire passed astonishingly fast.\nAnd every single day, I couldn’t help but suffer.\nMy patience was so strong that I wondered if it was even possible, and the month seemed like a time where pain and happiness were ambiguously mixed.\nOf course, even that pain... was the pain of not fulfilling my own desires, so in reality, it could be seen as a life filled with happiness by others.\nThe originally planned month in Ortaire would come to an end tomorrow.\nIn other words, tomorrow, Adilun and I would have to leave for Rodenov once again.\nA lot of things happened during this time. We went to see the wheat fields together, and she even approached me and seduced me while I was training at the gymnasium.\nAt the picnic, we almost crossed the line once because we both couldn’t stand our desires, but we managed to hold back.\nAnd that was not all. Adilun, who had become more proactive since the incident at the picnic, didn't even stop showing affectionate gestures in front of the members of my family.\nThe expressions of my family members, looking at me with pride, still lingered in my mind... I didn’t actually know that Adilun thought of me as her possession.\nShe didn’t want me to be taken away by someone else, so she didn’t show any hesitation in showing affection in front of others to prove that I was her own.\nIt wasn't that I didn't like it. No! I actually enjoyed it. However, the problem was... the limit of my patience. Even controlling the accumulated desires on my own had its limits.\nNow, merely looking at her made my l*wer b*dy feel sore, making me realize that I was reaching my limits.\nIt was even more dangerous if I went to Rodenov and got into an accident. Perhaps, in that case, we might not even be able to keep our promise and go straight to our wedding ceremony.\nIn the eyes of others, it might have seemed like a happy concern, and it wasn’t a line that should never be crossed… … But for me, who had a strong desire to get to know her better, that line itself was a line that should not be crossed without the right time.\nIn my head, the thought of Adilun and the desire to touch her body, the desire to hear her gasp for breath were all mixed together into a consuming desire itself.\nTo the point where if I couldn’t stand this patience even a little, I would attack her right away.\nAnd at that moment, something suddenly came to my mind.\nIt was the words Adilun said to me during the picnic.\n'If it becomes too difficult to endure, come to my room.'\nAs soon as that thought crossed my mind, I started thinking about various questions.\n'What should I do? Should I visit her room tonight? But would she need some preparation as well? Even if we don't cross any lines... engaging in similar actions might still burden her.'\n'In that case, I should probably ask for permission separately.'\n.\n.\n.\nI was now not able to think of anything other than Adilun in my mind, so I couldn't bear it any longer... I looked at Adilun, who was walking with her arms crossed and said.\n\"Um, Adilun?\"\nShe had a face filled with satisfaction after finishing the meal. It was so beautiful that it made me have the urge to touch her right away... I wondered if it was becoming severe.\n\"Yes? What is it?\"\n\"I have something to say...\"\nI lowered my voice and brought my mouth close to her ear. She started to listen attentively, wondering what was going on.\n\"Tonight, maybe... Can I come to see you?\"\n\"......Huh?\"\nIn an instant, Adilun’s face turned red.\n\"I mean... Does that mean you’re having a hard time?”\n\"......Yes. I'm embarrassed to say this but...\"\n\"Ah, no. It's okay. You don't need to apologize. Yes, it's only natural. I'm actually grateful that you told me.\"\nShe even seemed a bit pleased. I couldn't tell the exact reason, but maybe it was because she realized that I needed her.\n\"Then... late at night. Would it be okay?”\n\"......Yes. Since tomorrow is the day we're leaving for Rodenov, so I think it would be better if I relieve my desires to some extent.”\n“I see. then… … Later, late at night… … come find me. I'll be prepared.”\n\"Thank you, Adilun.\"\n\"Ah, no. It's all because of me.\"\n\"Well, that's true. It's all because Adilun is so charming.\"\n“Euh....”\nShe seemed a little embarrassed, but it was clear that she was more than happy.\n'I'm not sure if this is the right thing to do, but...'\nAnyway, the thought of being able to relieve the desires that had been building up all this time made my heart beat faster.\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\nI pondered over what Physis had said.\nLast month, although I had tried to seduce him, my body started to heat up automatically at the fact that Physis, who hadn’t done anything other than passionately k*ss me from time to time after the picnic, wanted me.\nAs soon as I heard this good news, I couldn’t help but think about what to wear tonight, what fragrance to apply, and how I should s*tisfy his desires.\nTypically, the nobles of Enadeim were obligated to receive sex education when they turned fifteen.\nI was no exception.\nI believed that I had no need to interact with anyone and thought I would live alone. So consequently, I initially resisted my mother's words and refused to receive that education.\nHowever, I had no choice but to be educated at my mother’s earnest request to know just in case… … I never thought the education I received at that time would be of help in times like these.\n'Indeed, it is important to learn anything in advance.'\nVarious acts came to my mind. I clearly remembered the things I had read through books in s*x education class.\nHow to ple*se men with your bre*sts, how to ple*se them with your m*uth… …There were quite a number of acts, and I had read them as much as I could while blushing.\nHonestly, at that time I was just curious.\nIf someday I truly shed my scales and could love someone... What could I do for them? It was so intriguing that I even had vague imagination.\nAnd now, that imagination had become a reality and was piercing through me.\nPhysis Ortaire.\nThat name engraved wounds in my heart and led me to perdition, but before I knew it, he healed those wounds and lifted me up to the heavens. And now he became the one who stole my heart.\nHe... he became everything to me.\nFrom now on, my heart would forever belong to him, and I hoped his heart would belong to me. So today was a rehearsal for that moment.\nAfter my transformation, every moment spent with him was blissful. Even the moments when I became blind with jealousy and when we shared kisses...\nThinking about it, all those acts were ultimately for my sake.\nThere were no acts for him. He always played the role of endurance.\nSo, that was why...\nThat was why... Today, I didn't want him to hold back. As long as we don't cross the bottom line.\nI called Mina, who was waiting for my order outside the room. And... in today's b*th, I planned to have a rose fragrance, and the n*gligee I would wear tonight was intended to be somewhat, no, quite reve*ling... So that he could easily und*ess me.\nI even considered having a drink, but I shook my head and rejected that thought.\n'I won't drink. I'll keep my mind clear... and confine him within my embrace.'\n'So you can look forward to it, Physis.'\n'Because today, I’m not going to sleep. I will use my whole b*dy to pl*ase you.'\n* * *\n[Omniscient POV]\n'Why is time passing so slowly?'\nPhysis couldn't help but feel that way. Every minute and every second felt restless, and even when he ate, he couldn't distinguish whether the food passed through his nose or his mouth.\nHowever, despite his inner turmoil, his outward demeanor showed no signs of trouble, which led his family to smile and laugh when they looked at Adilun and him.\nNow, as the time approached for their departure tomorrow, the Countess, who had built a friendship with Adilun over the past month, began calling Adilun by her first name and using informal language.\n\"It's a pity, Adilun. I wish you could stay a little longer....\"\n\"I feel the same way, Mother. But I promise, whenever I have the time, I will definitely visit again.\"\n\"How can you speak so beautifully? Just how did such a fine child like you end up with our foolish son?\"\n\"That's true.\"\nAs Physis nodded his head approvingly, Adilun blushed slightly.\n\"Will you treat me well from now on?\"\n\"Yess!!\"\nAs Adilun whispered softly into his ear, his voice was loud enough for everyone around to hear, but after a month of witnessing Adilun's sincere gestures of affection, everyone in Physis' family had become accustomed to it and simply smiled.\nAfter a somewhat noisy dinner, Adilun excused herself and went to her room, requesting Physis to come late.\n'How many hours had passed?'\nWhen Physis looked outside, it was already late at night.\nAt this hour, all the servants must have fallen asleep.\nPhysis could no longer bear the increasing tension in his body and the growing restlessness. He felt that he had to release his desires in some way, at least once.\nNo, once wouldn't be enough. The patience he had maintained for a month, or perhaps even before that, was finally about to be broken.\n'It should be fine now.'\nPhysis nodded and moved cautiously to Adilun's room, next to his.\nAll the servants were already fallen asleep. In the quiet corridor, there was no one except for him, and the sound of his gentle knock echoed softly, twice.\n– Come in.\nWhat he heard was not words, but a s*ductive and softly lingering scent.\nCould Adilun be able to produce such a voice? Without saying a word, Physis immediately opened the door.\nAs soon as the door opened, a strong scent of roses drifted faintly into his nose. The already difficult-to-endure s*xual desire combined with the intoxicating scent of roses, pushed him into a state of extreme excitement.\nThe shadow of Adilun was projecting on the curtained bed. Physis moved slowly toward the bed, like a foolish pilgrim bewitched by a dreamer. Not in a hurry, slowly.\nIt was a strange situation. Although his b*dy was urging him to move quickly, he couldn't help but feel an intuition that he shouldn't rush through this moment.\n-Click.\nThe open door automatically closed... and suddenly, the lock clicked.\nIn an instant, a faint flow of mana formed a barrier in the room.\n-Swoosh.\nThe cover that surrounded Adilun's bed was lifted, revealing her s*ductive figure.\nHer clothes were barely held by thin straps, revealing her b*re sk*n and the alluring glimpse of what lay beneath, it was a fatally s*ductive n*gligee.\nHer und*rg*rments, delicately held by thin straps, seemed as if they would fall off at any moment when the laces were undone, and her bewitching golden eyes, partially unveiled, sed*ced him.\n\"Now, no one can enter this room, and no sound can escape. I've also slightly slowed down the flow of time.\"\nHer mesmerizing low-pitched voice was enchanting.\n'Slowing down time? Is such a thing possible?'\nPerhaps the question that arose in Physis' mind was also reflected in Adilun's thoughts, as she spoke, folding the corners of her eyes.\n\"Because I'm a dragon. I can't stop time, but I can slightly slow down it within the barrier. So... let's take it slowly today.\"\n\"H-Haa...\"\nA suppressed sigh escaped from Physis' lips.\nHis l*wer p*rt had swollen enough to be seen by Adilun, and as soon as she noticed it, she let out a restrained sigh, just like him.\nUnbearable desire surged within her, was also making her l*wer belly burn hotly.\n\"Haa... It's because of me, right? You endured for so long.\"\n“I-it was… …It was very hard.”\nIt was a plea, filled with agony.\nAdilun may not have understood how strong a man's s*xual d*sire could be, but seeing Physis struggling so much made her incredibly happy that he had expressed it to her today.\n\"You endured well. So... Please come here.\"\nAt the same time as she said that, Physis headed toward Adilun as if rushing forward.\nAdilun simply spread her arms wide and embraced him.\nRomance? Mood? Those things were unnecessary for the two of them.\nPhysis t*re apart Adilun's n*gligee. Even though the n*gligee was t*rn by the strong grip, Adilun only smiled with joy.\n\"Haa, haa, haa...\"\nPhysis' rationality gradually became paralyzed. The intoxicating scent of roses lingered at the tip of his nose, and in front of his eyes, he began to see Adilun's bre*sts he had eagerly desired.\nAdilun, who had been hesitant about exposing herself, had unknowingly worn clothes that did not accentuate her ch*st, but her bre*sts proudly displayed their substantial size, er*ding Physis' rationality.\nDriven by his instinct, Physis buried his head in Adilun's ch*st and, licked her breasts with his tongue as if drinking the elixir of life, and then began s*cking on the bashful fruit that bloomed on the tip of her br*asts.\nAn obscene sound resounded, and an electrifying pleasure pierced through Adilun's spine, p*netrating her mind.\n\"Ahhh! Ugh!\"\nEven with Physis' t*ngue roughly exploring her n*pples, Adilun felt no pain. Instead, the pleasure that shook everything overwhelmed her, shaking her to her core.\nWhen her sweet mo*ns reached Physis' ears, he discarded the last remaining piece of his sanity.\nLike a beast driven only by instinct, he ceased his actions of exploring Adilun's bre*sts and moved for a more satisfying act. He untied the straps of Adilun's secretive und*rwe*r that concealed her intim*te are*, revealing her in her most beautiful form.\nFor Physis, the cloth that covered his body felt like the mightiest barrier in the world. He hurriedly moved his hands to demolish that barrier, but his overexcited hands started to go awry. There was no way it would go well.\nAs if recognizing Physis' frustration, Adilun slowly unbuttoned his shirt while pr*ssing her l*ps against his.\n\"Umm...\"\nHer hands stopped engrossed in kis*ing, but her magic did not stop. She ripp*d off every button on Physis’ shirt, undr*ssing his top completely.\nFollowing that, Adilun once again overlapped her l*ps and playfully shook her hand. As a result, Physis' l*wer b*dy finally shed all its cumbersome attire, revealing its original state.\nAdilun stopped the k*ss and gazed at Physis' b*dy... she couldn't help but be amazed.\n‘That, it's that big...?'\nCertainly, it wasn’t that big when she saw it in the book.\nIn terms of length, it reached from her chin to her forehead. An overwhelmingly large p*nis, like a tower reaching for the sky, stood er*ct from Physis' l*wer p*rt.\nPhysis tried to run at Adirun again, breathing heavily, but…\n“No.”\n\"...Why, why!\"\nPhysis, whose rationality was paralyzed, yelled at Adilun when she blocked his instinct. However, Adilun paid no attention to his reaction and shook her head.\n“I’m not ready yet.”\n\"What do you mean...!\"\nPhysis' passionate howl reached Adilun's ears, but she continued to restrain him and used her magic.\nAt the same time, faint marks appeared on Adilun's left br*ast and Physis’ left ch*st.\n\"This is...?\"\n\"I found out... Among the magic, there is also a magic that increases each other’s senses.”\nAdilun was surprised by Physis' stuff, but she made an effort to remain calm. In this situation, even she had to maintain her composure to avoid crossing a line.\n\"Now, Physis. Calm down a little. Today is a day for you, but I can make it more enjoyable for you than if you moved yourself.”\nPhysis momentarily regained his sanity. He longed to rush toward Adilun's enchanting body, but he could only burn with frustration, unable to do anything under Adilun's restraint.\n\"First, a k*ss... I... I want to k*ss you.\"\nAdilun approached Physis and pressed her l*ps against his.\nPhysis eagerly s*cked Adilun's lips. It wasn't a sweet kiss like before, but a passionate one where they c*nsumed each other.\nTheir t*ngues entwined, exchanging s*liva, and the kiss continued as they wrapped their t*ngues ar*und each other.\nPhysis' p*nis, already h*rd, began to swell even more.\n\"Next... The bre*sts. Are my bre*sts still pretty?\"\nAdilun guided Physis' hand to her bre*sts.\nInstead of answering, Physis followed that guidance and grabbed the bre*st in front of his hand.\nInstead of feeling excruciating pain, pleasure surged through her ch*st before any pain could be felt.\n\"Ha, haah...!\"\nLast time, even when he only touched her horns, she had reached a pale clim*x.\nAs she used the magic to amplify her senses and surrendered herself to Physis’ touch, she had no choice but to reach the clim*x naturally. Electric currents surged through her head, momentarily causing her vision to blur.\nShe didn't expect it to be this intense.\nBut Adilun made an effort to regain her composure. There were still many things she wanted to do for him, and she couldn't selfishly indulge herself here.\nLooking at Adilun reaching clim*x, Physis held his throbbing p*nis as if he couldn't bear it any longer. Whether it was an attempt to m*sturb*te because he couldn't hold back any longer, he roughly sho*k his p*nis.\nAdilun noticed that scene belatedly and bound his hand with her magic.\n“No… I told you... You can't”\nAdilun's golden eyes gleamed dangerously as they met Physis' lost gaze due to his ar*usal.\n\"This... Let me do it.\"\n\"No. It's meaningless if you do it yourself. So... Trust me.\"\nAdilun clamped Physis’ p*nis between her own br*asts.\n\"Ugh...!\"\nPhysis felt like he was losing his mind from the soft sensation between Adilun's bre*sts.\nBut Adilune's actions didn't end there.\nAfter moistening her mouth slightly, she dr*pped s*liva onto his g*nitals and began stimulating his p*nis by sh*king her bre*sts.\n\"Ah...!\"\n-Throb, throb.\nThe p*nis trapped between her bre*sts seemed to be ecstatic, letting out desperate cries as it swelled. It was a sign of clim*x.\nHowever, unfortunately, Adilun did not allow even that.\n“No.”\nJust as her shaking bre*sts were about to stop, Physis looked at her with instinct-driven eyes.\n\"Adilun...!\"\nIt was like the growl of a beast, but... Adilun, who was equally excited to a dreadful extent as Physis, felt her body ignite in response to that growl.\nOf course, Adilun had no intention of tormenting him. She instinctively knew that she had to maintain boundaries and refrain from certain actions.\nShe covered her teeth with mana. Because she, who was still clumsy and inexperienced, didn’t know what damage she might cause him and his precious thing.\nLittle by little, Mana transformed into a soft material that covered her teeth.\nNow she could accept his th*ng without any burden. Adilun, satisfied, smiled and to*k his p*nis into her m*uth.\n\"Mmm...\"\nShe immediately sw*llowed his p*nis all the way down to her thr*at. Even though his p*nis reaching her thr*at would have been painful, she endured even the rising sensation of nausea and vigorously s*cked his p*nis.\n-Squish, squish...\nObscene and v*lgar sounds began to be heard.\n\"Ah...!\"\nIntensified sensations surged through Physis' entire b*dy. Peripheral nerve pleasure overwhelmed his entire being.\nHe had reached the point of explosion after enduring it for the past month. Adilun responded to his groans and spoke in a corrupting voice in his head.\n-I love you.\nThose words became the detonator as Physis' p*nis swelled violently and finally ej*cul*ted his white, thick se*d towards Adilun's thr*at.\nThick s*men splashed into Adilun's thr*at, but she swallowed it all, throwing away all the pain, and li*ked his hypersensitive gl*ns with her t*ngue.\n\"Ah...\"\nEven Physis, who thought he would never lose consciousness from any shock, couldn’t overcome the hot pleasure from Adilun’s t*ngue and the soft mana protection that covered her teeth.\nHe was on the verge of falling into a trance. The pleasure that had been pent up for a month, combined with the lingering sensation, was an overwhelming sensation to endure.\n-Snap.\nHowever, Adilun had anticipated that Physis would lose consciousness in extreme pleasure. She immediately sent a thrilling current through his body, restoring his consciousness.\n“Ugh…!”\nStill unable to regain his senses from the pleasure emanating from his g*nit*ls, when Physis showed signs of not being able to regain his composure, Adilun carefully bit his p*nis and sent a voice message to his head.\n-Isn't this a bit too much? I would have said that the time today would... flow slowly.\nIt was a provocation. A bold provocation.\nPhysis easily succumbed to the provocation. The exc*tement of surrendering to Adilun's whims invaded his entire b*dy and mind, and tension began to build up in his entire body.\nHe didn't want to give Adilun the upper hand like this. He should be the one to release his desires, so why should Adilun take control?\nPhysis already knew all too well what Adilun's weakness was.\nThose tantalizing and thick horns. The greatest weakness that could steal Adilun's sanity...\n– Haa... Adilun, there is one thing I wanted to try.\nSuddenly mixed with a growl, Physis’ words invaded Adilun's mind. At that, Adilun smiled at him and answered.\n– If you want you can try it, and I will try mine.\nThen she began to intensify the stim*lation on Physis’ p*nis. The hot, soft touch wrapped around his p*nis again, and her thr*at embraced his p*nis again.\nIt was an unbearable feeling of conquest. However, Physis wanted to feel this conquest even more, so he grabbed Adilun's horn.\n“Huh!”\nThe intense pleasure that came out of the moment made Adilun’s mind go blank, and her m*uth bit Physis’ p*nis hard. But fortunately, due to the mana she put on her teeth, the pressure that should have turned into pain gave Physis intense pleasure.\n“H-haaaa… …”\nThe half-blind Physis grabbed Adilun by the horns and started shaking his waist. A strong current of pleasure began to circulate through his b*dy.\nAs Adilun did her part, she felt thrilling pleasure at the composition of the loved one pressuring her fiercely and driving her like a beast, and a storm of amplified senses emanated from the horns gripped so strongly that they were about to break at any moment in Physis’ hand. It stirred up and gave her an unbearable pleasure all over her body.\nThe storm of pleasure did not stop there. The intense pressure in her m*uth and throat was giving her a mind-numbing pleasure.\nA strong sense of masochism, different from the sense of conquest, made her whole body in a state of extreme excitement.\nA slimy liq*id gradually trickled down from her v*gina, wet the floor, and her mind began to flow in a hazy dream.\nEven so, she didn’t miss Physis’ p*nis swelling again. Realizing that his b*dy was shaking, she held on tightly to his waist and took his p*nis as far as her neck allowed.\n“Cough… Cough…!”\nAnd once again, the action resumed. Just as Adilun's thr*at and m*uth were filled with Physis' s*men, he withdrew his g*nit*ls from Adilun's m*uth.\n\"Haah, haah...\"\nThe size of his p*nis decreased slightly as if he had lost some strength. Seeing Physis looking a bit exhausted, Adilun gathered the s*men filling her mouth on her t*ngue and extended it towards him.\n- Ahh\nShe looked up at Physis and smiled, and Physis, who had finally come back to his senses, said in a panic.\n\"Adilun, that... shouldn't be eaten. It's dirty.\"\nHowever, despite Physis' objection, Adilun, with a happy expression, swallowed his s*men and spoke to him with a face full of affection.\n\"It's not dirty. In six months, it will be filled in my w*mb... it's your se*d. Is that... dirty?\"\nAt her somewhat stern words, Physis lowered his head.\nAs if it were all a joke, Adilun used a cleanliness spell to clean her mouth and then got up from her position, pulling him close and tumbling onto the bed together.\nContinuing with passionate ki*ses, Physis' p*nis began to swell again.\n\"I'm relieved. It seems like we still have a long way to go...\"\nWith a slightly dangerous glint in Adilun's eyes... Physis' sanity began to fade once again.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "Chapter 72: Passion (2)\nAdilun lay next to Physis, gazing at him affectionately as he ignited a passionate desire for her.\nShe couldn't help but find it endearing. He was someone she had yearned for so long.\nIn fact, up until now, Adilun had been somewhat uneasy.\nHaving lived with a monstrous appearance all along, Adilun had doubts about whether it would be okay to harbor feelings for Physis, even after undergoing transformation.\nIt was deeply unsettling to witness Physis and Lobelia dancing during the National Foundation Day celebration. It seemed unimaginable that such a thing would happen to her.\nWho would love a princess with such a monstrous appearance... she wondered.\nFor a year, Physis had gradually diminished her self-esteem, making her believe she didn't deserve love from anyone.\nAlthough the anxiety of not knowing when his new attitude might change was relieved through the process of transformation, Adilun couldn't approach him due to her own misery.\nHowever, her appearance revealed after the transformation was unbelievable even to her own eyes.\nHer golden eyes, which she considered as fierce as a dragon's gaze, were now truly captivating. The sharp contours of her eyes, the graceful arch of her nose, and her lips carried a subtle hint of rose.\nHer flawless white skin showed no tolerance for imperfections.\nEverything that composed her body... couldn't be more beautiful.\nShe was genuinely delighted by that fact.\nNow she realized that she, too, was a woman worthy of receiving someone's love...\nAdilun spoke boldly and actively s*duced Physis for the same reason. Her anger and hatred towards him subsided, and her affection towards him gradually rose, transforming her inner self.\nTo those who coveted him, she felt jealousy and bitter rage.\nTo his warm gaze directed at her... she felt affection towards him.\nAs these emotions repeated, Adilun couldn't deny it.\nHer transformation had become the catalyst for all these events.\nAnd today... when she finally revealed everything about herself, the reaction that Physis was displaying was highly satisfying to her as well.\nHe had eyes that yearned for her, l*sting and eager, causing an uncontrollable restlessness. The eyes that had always been rational, except for one moment during the National Foundation Day celebration, now harbored such desire because of her... Did this mean that Physis had succumbed to the feminine charm she possessed within herself?\nThis fact excited Adilun.\n“Hehe...”\nEven though nothing had happened yet, an excited breath escaped from Adilun's mouth, and her b*dy started to burn with heat.\nPhysis simply gazed at her, his eyes were shining. As if... the eyes of a madman.\n“Physis. Physis...”\nAdilun desperately called out to Physis, guiding his hand to her ch*st.\nHer br*asts, which were sufficiently large, couldn't fit entirely into Physis' hand and began to be covered by his hand.\nInstead of solely exploring her soft br*asts, Physis started kissing Adilun's face, placing kisses on various parts of her face.\nWas it that his affection for Adilun outweighed his trembling desire? With eyes like a madman, he engaged in tender actions that alone drove Adilun crazy.\nShe was the one s*ducing him, but it almost seemed as if she were the one being s*duced.\nPhysis' breath brushed against her forehead, gently.\nA soft kiss landed. Next, on the right eyelid, then the left eyelid. Next, the bridge of the nose, followed by the cheek and then the ear.\nPhysis placed his lips on Adilun's ear and lightly nibbled.\nAnd that sensation became an electrifying current and shook Adilun's b*dy.\n\"Hah!\"\nSlowly, tenderly stroking her br*asts and gently caressing her ear, Physis' actions made Adilun shudder.\nBut Physis restrained himself despite the enchanting sight. Although his performance was slightly impaired by his persistent erection despite already having ej*culated twice, now he wanted to bring happiness to the woman who had ple*sured him by taking his m*nhood into her m*uth.\nHe gradually lowered the hand resting on Adilun's ch*st. Underneath her br*asts, he lightly caressed the belly where her womb was supposed to be... Above the navel and below it.\nWith his fingers, he gently touched Adilun's precious and most secretive place. The sensation of her soft and moist flesh, glistening with love j*ice, traveled through his hand and excited him.\n\"Haahh!\"\nWithout even realizing it, Adilun was startled and instinctively closed her mouth when Physis sent his own mouth, which had been lingering near her ear, toward her lips, exploring them.\n\"Um...\"\nThe tongues of the two people which were intermingling countless times unknowingly created a soggy sound as they crossed each other, accompanied by m*ans of pleasure.\nThe scent of roses emanating from Adilun’s body had already been mixed with Physis' scent, transforming into an even more lascivious fragrance.\nYet Physis' hand did not stop caressing Adilun’s cr*tch. Just as he felt good, he wished for Adilun to feel good too.\nIndeed, it was regrettable. Physis couldn't help but think that naturally. He wished the fingers that touched her intimate p*rts were not fingers but his own m*nhood.\nEven though his rationality was clouded by his rising desire, he couldn't afford to compromise on that matter. Even now, disentangling himself from the enthralling grasp of Adilun was no easy feat, and if he had truly gone all the way... what would come next, he wondered.\nHe could tell without thinking. It was likely that he would have been completely obsessed with her, making it impossible for him to lead a normal daily life.\nThis was his first s*xual encounter with a woman both in his past and present lives. To him, as a v*rgin, this stim*lation was an unknown territory, but that unknown territory gave him a sense of pleasure and satisfaction far beyond his expectations.\nIt was merely a pseudo-s*xual act and not a proper one... but even with this pseudo-s*xual act alone, it felt as if his mind was slipping away. If he were to engage in actual int*rcourse with her, it might even drive him to lose his sanity.\nThat was why he was enduring.\nThey had agreed to save the proper act for later. Instead, if they were to engage in the proper act... he couldn't predict how long he would t*rment her. Perhaps, he wouldn't stop until she bec*me pregnant. According to his desires.\nBut now was not the time to think about that situation. Adilun was desperately craving his hand.\nHe gently teased Adilun's intim*te area, which was already overflowing with even more love j*ice. He would lightly insert his finger, wiggle it, and press firmly at certain points.\nAnd every time he did that, Adilun's reaction changed dramatically.\nThe mouth that had been kissing abruptly stopped, and as Physis’ fingers moved, she began to emit l*wd s*xual desires.\nPhysis enjoyed that response and continued to kiss Adilun's lips while running his hand through her hair.\nIt was said that the mouth was the place where the soul connects.\nHe vaguely remembered hearing such words before. He coveted her mouth and tongue, as if sucking up Adilun's soul.\nAdilun was not idle either. She also grabbed Physis' m*nhood with her empty hand and started to gently str*ke it.\nAs she lightly str*ked his m*nhood from the root to the tip with her fingers, Physis also felt dizzy from the sudden rush of pleasure.\nThe two of them were giving themselves to each other in that way. However, they couldn't go as far as the final act... only the intersection.\nAs if disappointed by that fact, Physis stopped the kiss with Adilun.\nAdilun looked at him with regret at the sudden stop of the kiss, and Physis, who laid Adilun upright with his arm, cast a shadow over her and began to bring his m*nhood to her v*gina.\n\"Ph-Physis, not there.\"\n“… … I know.”\nAdilun momentarily worried if Physis had lost his senses, but he had not reached that point yet. He simply placed his m*nhood below Adilun's V*gina.\n-Swish.\nHer wet p*ssy caressed Physis’ p*nis with softness and a sloppy feel.\nAlong with the instant pleasure of being struck by lightning, Adilun's mouth let out an even louder m*an than before.\n\"Ah, aaah!\"\nHad Adilun ever made such a loud sound? Not to mention, she had never raised a voice this loud when she was yelling.\nMoreover, that sound... it was a m*an of pleasure. While Physis himself was in a state where he wouldn't be surprised even if he lost his mind, he tried his best to maintain his composure and began to move his m*nhood against Adilun's p*ssy.\n\"Ah, agh! Ah, aaah!\"\nEvery time his p*nis brushed the crack between her c*nts, Adilun's voice, tinged with pleasure, echoed in Physis' ears.\nAs the speed of Physis' thr*sts increased and Adilun's m*ans grew more frequent, Physis was gradually consumed by an intense desire to release his passion.\nPhysis e*culated his s*men onto Adilun's belly, and Adilun asked him with a breathless voice.\n“Haaah… … Did you... did you like it?”\n“… …Yes. And you?”\n“Me too, I liked it too. Ha… …I'm... happy.\"\nAdilun, with a flushed face from the happiness, gazed at him with dreamy eyes. This aroused Physis once again, and his p*nis could not help but become er*ct.\n“Didn’t you say that time passes slowly in this barrier?”\nPhysis' tone changed to informal due to excitement, but Adilun whispered softly to him as if it pleased her.\n“… …Yes.”\n“Great. I won’t let you sleep today.”\n“Please do as you please.”\nAs soon as Adilun finished speaking, Physis held her horns. With her horns in his hands, he moved his waist, repeating the actions from earlier.\n- Squelch, squelch...\nThe strange sound of the p*nis and v*gina rubbing against each other lingered in Adilun’s ears, but Adilun had no time to pay attention to the noise.\nPhysis’ strong hand touching her horn, his p*nis was brushing her v*gina… … Her mind was in a daze, and from the corner of her mouth, loud voices came out in return.\n“Ah, ah… … Haah, ha, ha ha!”\nFinally, she, too, reached org*sm, and a strange but fragrant juice splashed from her cr*tch onto Physis’ waist. Was it because she had dragon traits? Could it be because she inherited the bloodline of a dragon, a pure being?\nEven the scent of their bodily fluids was fragrant, causing Physis to completely lose himself in the act with Adilun.\nTheir passionate breaths intertwined, their feverish respiration matching each other. Their lips m*lded together, their intim*te p*rts pressed against one another, sometimes t*uching, sometimes caressing with their m*uths.\nEspecially when Physis took Adilun's intim*te p*rt into his mouth, Adilun couldn't help but gasp and reciprocate by pleasuring Physis' intimate p*rt. If they hadn't done so, Physis would have almost lost his sanity.\nTheir intense actions continued until the next morning, despite the unfolding of a temporal barrier.\nFor reference, the temporal barrier created by Adilun...\nMade time pass three times slower than usual.\nHaving engaged in their activities from late night until morning, the two of them were completely absorbed in their actions throughout the entire day.\nFinally, as their activities came to an end and Physis' inner desires somewhat subsided, Adilun leaned toward Physis with a happy expression and kissed him.\n\"Ah... I love you, I love you, Physis.\"\n\"I love you too...\"\nPhysis, who had also found some relief from the desires that had been suppressed for the past few months, smiled as he accepted her kiss.\n\"Hehe, You are still flirting. One last time, how about it?”\nAnd Physis had no choice but to accept Adilun's audacious proposal.\nTogether... the two of them began to eagerly yearn for the end of the next six months.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "Chapter 73: Return (1)\n*This is a brief explanation for underage readers.\nCurrently, Physis and Adilun have spent a month in Ortaire and were now heading to Rodenov today.\n* * *\n[Physis' POV]\nAfter a night filled with ecstasy, morning finally arrived.\nIndulged in love, we tidied up the room messy room. In fact, there wasn’t much I did. With one gesture from Adilun, the room that had been covered with our bodily fluids became tidy all at once, as if time had turned back.\n\"Oh.\"\n\"Uh, I'm tired.\"\n\"You've worked hard.\"\n\"Hehe.\"\nI embraced Adilun gently, noticing her exhaustion from maintaining the barrier throughout the previous night. I tenderly kissed her on neck, and slightly sucked on it, leaving a deep imprint, as she had left her stamp on me.\nNow our bodies were covered in all kinds of red lip-shaped marks. Perhaps... if someone saw them, they would think we had been passionately working really hard...\n\"Shouldn't we cover these marks?\"\n\"Huh? What are you talking about?\"\nWhen I suggested covering the marks, Adilun responded as if asking why we should.\n\"Well, if they know that you haven't been in your room until this hour, the servants will definitely figure it out. Where did you go? And the door that won't open.\"\nHer slightly smiling face was irresistibly charming, like a fox.\n\"Maybe rumors will spread everywhere. Haha.\"\nAs I said that, I couldn't help but notice her extremely satisfied and somewhat possessive expression. Honestly, I still felt a burning sensation.\nBut I had to be patient.\nI never imagined I could have such patience. After all, I didn't cross the final line.\nInstead, I gave her a strong embrace.\n\"Do you regret it?\"\nAdilun gently chuckled and asked me a question.\n\"...Yes. Maybe...\"\n\"Hehe. Actually, I didn't completely disregard that possibility. I hope you'll be even more obsessed with me, so you won't pay attention to other bitches. That's what I want. So they won't catch your eye.\"\n\"I don't have any intention of looking at anyone else anyway.\"\n\"Yes, I won't either. But... you never know what will happen in the human mind.\"\nHer anxious words reminded me that the things I had said over the past year had diminished her self-esteem. Yes, it was my fault.\nAlthough she had a certain confidence in me to some extent, it seemed that she was developing such anxiety that I might abandon her if a woman, more attractive than her appeared.\nAs our bodies intertwined, that tendency seemed to grow even stronger.\n\"Don't worry. I will never abandon you. No matter what woman comes... There will be no one else to look at except you.”\nAs I confidently spoke those words, Adilun erased her anxiety and smiled.\n\"I believe you. But... I don't like other women looking at you. I even have a selfish thought that I wish you didn't go anywhere in Rodenov and just stayed with me.\"\n\"If Adilun wants, I won't attend any gatherings or banquets in the future.\"\nAdilun shook her head at my words.\n\"I can't do that. It's just my selfishness... You must have your own things to do. It would be impossible for you to follow me every time. You have your own life.\"\n\"It won't happen very often. So don't worry too much. For me, you are always my top priority.\"\n\"Yes, I will. But can you start using informal language now? You did that last night too.\"\n\"Why? Don't you like it?\"\n\"I wouldn't mind. In fact, I like it. Ah, Physis.\"\n\"Yes?\"\nAdilun wrapped her arms around my neck and kissed me. It was a loving kiss that barely touched and lingered, filled with affection.\n“I forgot. Good morning. And are we going to do this kiss thing every day?”\n\"...Yes.\"\nAt her response, my heart fluttered with the intense affection I felt from her. Her words... gradually started to make me feel restless. Would I be able to endure for the long period of six months?\n\"Well, shall we start getting ready to go out? I'm hungry too. Oh, but first, I need to wash up. Actually, I can solve it with a cleaning spell... but I just want to take a bath.\"\n“Shall we go in together?”\n\"...Yes.\"\nWhen I hinted with a smile, she just blushed.\n.\n.\n.\nEventually, even in the bathroom, we passionately explored each other. And when we finally dressed and stepped out of the room, it was already late afternoon.\nSo… … Everyone in Ortaire came to know about the relationship we had established.\nUsually, during that time, I would have been in the training grounds. But I wasn't even in my room, nor was there any trace of me leaving.\nNaturally, the attention of the servants shifted toward Adilun's room... which was firmly locked.\nRealizing what had happened, the servants and maids reported it to the head maid and the butler, and the whole family came to know about it.\nSo now, I...\n“Oh my goodness.”\nI couldn’t help but receive the exciting gazes of my family. My mother covered her one cheek with her hand and her eyes were shining brightly, and the expressions of my older brother and father didn't seem displeased too.\nAdilun, on the other hand, simply had a smile on her face, whether she spoke or not.\nThe reason why my mother exclaimed like that was actually quite simple.\nEven if she had known only the fact that we had entered a relationship, she would have looked at us with a proud smile. But since Adilun and I had reddened necks, the exclamation naturally came out.\nAfter all, we were in a situation where two people who had been unable to get their hands on each other had finally overlapped their bodies.\n“Shouldn’t we really speed up the ceremony, my dear?”\n\"Cough. Since the two of them have said they're not ready yet, let's wait a little longer.\"\nMy father coughed and spoke.\nHonestly, it wasn't really awkward or anything. We were already engaged... and it was possible for something like this to happen.\nHowever, the gazes of my family members, who looked at me with interest, felt somewhat unfamiliar.\nIt was as if… … Should I say that they were like people who show interest in an unexpected romance?\n\"Well, the two of them also need time. Isn't it natural that the period before marriage is the most passionate?\"\nIt was a bit absurd to see my older brother openly saying such things even though he had never dated a woman.\n\"So, how many children are you thinking of, Adilun?\"\n“uh… … That. I think it’s still a little too early for a child.”\n\"I see. Well, I guess that's understandable. You're about to become the Duchess of Rodenov... But still, the sooner you have a successor, the better, right?\"\n\"Ahaha. Y-yes, that's true.\"\nAdilun, who just moments ago had a somewhat confident expression, became visibly flustered when the topic of children came up. Well, it was true that we coveted each other's bodies, but we didn't cross that line...\nThe topic of children seemed a bit distant for Adilun as well.\n\"Anyway, I hope both of you are careful today, and if there's good news, I hope you'll let us know soon.\"\nIn response to my mother's gentle smile, we both just nodded.\n\"Yes...\"\nAs soon as the slightly late afternoon meal was over, we immediately packed our belongings and arrived at the teleportation gate that would take us to Rodenov.\nThe people of Ortaire bid farewell to Adilun with a slightly regretful expression. If it was for me, I could understand it, but Adilun definitely seemed to have gained quite a favorable impression from the people of Ortaire\n“Please come back soon, princess!”\n\"I will. Take care, everyone. I will definitely come back next time.\"\nAdilun waved to them and then firmly held my hand as we stepped onto the teleportation gate.\nWhen I opened my eyes, the climate that had been gently breezy instantly transformed into a cold blizzard.\nA feeling of coldness filled my lungs. But it wasn't unpleasant.\n“Yes.”\nHowever, since Adilun seemed a bit cold, I wrapped my coat around her shoulders.\n“Ah, thank you.”\n\"It's nothing, really.\"\nActually, Adilun might not have needed this coat. She was skilled in magic, after all. She could easily use a spell to maintain her body temperature.\nHowever, I hoped that she wouldn't feel cold, even for that brief moment when she used magic.\nAlthough she was originally able to withstand the cold, staying in the warm climate of Ortaire for a month might have weakened her resistance to the cold.\nPerhaps she understood my intention, as Adilun's expression was tinted with gratitude.\n“Shall we go?”\n\"Yes.\"\nThen, I wrapped my arms around her shoulders, got out of the teleport gate of Caltix Fortress, and headed towards Caltix Castle.\nThe scenery of Rodenov seen in a month did not change in particular.\nIt was a land of eternal winter, where the snow never ceased.\n\"Is it because it's been a while? I thought I wouldn't need to use magic, but it seems like I have to. Ugh, it's a bit cold.\"\n\"Do it quickly. I don't want you to catch a cold.\"\n\"Hehe. But catching a cold wouldn't be so bad if it means you'll be by my side all day.\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"Even if I don't catch a cold, You will still be by your side all the time, right?\"\n\"Well, that's true, but... even if you won't catch a cold I will be with you, so don't have such thoughts for no reason. It worries me.\"\n“Yes. I understand. Oh, but since we're in Rodenov after a long time, can we just walk instead of taking a carriage? I'll use a spell to maintain our body temperature.\"\n\"Sure. If that's what you want.\"\n-Tap, Tap.\nThe sound of our footsteps crunching the piled-up snow resonated vividly in our ears. We matched our steps with each other and walked harmoniously towards the Caltix Castle.\nAs I glanced back slightly, a row of footprints came into view.\nI smiled as I looked at those footprints. The closely aligned pairs of footprints seemed to reflect the closeness between me and Adilun.\n\"Huh? Why are you smiling like that?\"\nAdilun asked, curious about my expression, but I shook my head.\n\"Oh, it's nothing. Just... because I like this walk.\"\n\"Hehe. I like it too. Maybe it's because this is where I was born and raised? Just walking along the snowy path... it feels welcoming. Did you feel the same way when you walked in Ortaire ?\"\n\"Yes. It might have been similar.\"\n\"But from now on, I hope you consider Rodenov as your home like Ortaire.\"\nI could sense her hope in those words.\n\"I will. This place... is where we'll live together from now on.\"\n\"Yes...\"\nAdilun nodded and hooked her arm around mine. A faint fragrance filled the air, and the warmth emanating from her gentle body was comforting.\nAs we continued walking, we soon arrived at the Calixis Castle.\nEven though it had only been a month since I last saw it, instead of feeling overwhelmed by the grandeur of the building, there was a sense of longing. Without any disturbance... it was truly a peaceful homecoming.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

Did anything happen at Ortaire?”\n\"No. We had a peaceful rest.\"\n\"That's good to hear.\"\nAdilun hugged the two of them once and then came next to me.\n“Did Physis have a good rest too?”\n\"Yes.\"\nI replied with a smile, and Duke Johannes, who had just seen Adilun's expression brightens, looked at me with a satisfied look.\n\"Have both of you had your meals?\"\nAs Duchess Claudia brought up the topic of meals, we both nodded our heads.\n\"Yes, we ate in Ortaire.\"\n\"Then there's no need to prepare a meal. Alright, let's save the stories for dinner later. Oh, Adilun.\"\n\"Yes, Mother?\"\n\"Let's talk for a moment.\"\n\"Yes.\"\nAfter Adilun and Duchess Claudia left their seats, I faced Duke Johannes, who was looking at me.\n\"By the way, I have something to say... I feel a little sorry for bringing up this matter to someone who just came back from vacation, but I’m saying it because it’s necessary.”\n\"Please go ahead.\"\n\"Physis, can you take charge of training our knights?\"\n\"What?\"\n\"I've been hearing rumors that the appearance of monsters near the Frozen Wall has increased recently. That's why I sent Lucas to the vicinity of the Frozen Wall. He'll probably come back soon and explain the situation to me... but strangely, I can't shake off this feeling of unease.\"\n'The Frozen Wall and Monsters...'\nI was momentarily surprised that the time had already come, but I didn't show it.\n\"...I see. But isn't it too early for me to take charge of training the knights?\"\n\"Well, all the knights here already know your skills. And since you've always trained with the knights of Rodenov, the knights won't have any trouble following your orders. Besides, if Adilun is going to succeed me, you'll eventually have to take charge of the knights as well, right?\"\n\"That's true. Um... I understand for now. So, when should I start?\"\n\"From tomorrow. And if the situation worsens, we'll prepare a separate subjugation party. We should stop the monsters from gathering before they become a bigger threat.\"\n“I understand, Your Excellency.”\n\"Good. That's all for now. Oh, wait, there's one more thing I wanted to ask...\"\n\"Ah, what is it?\"\n\"When would be a good time for your wedding? Once this matter is over, it wouldn't be a bad idea to start preparing for the ceremony.\"\n“That, already… … I mean...?”\n\"Already? It's been a year and a half since the two of you got engaged. Other families would have already held the ceremony and moved on. I hope you don't dislike the idea.\"\n\"I would never.\"\n\"Well, then give it some serious thought. I noticed Adilun's expression brightened... and when I saw you, I had a strong feeling of trust. If that's the case, it's likely that a certain level of trust has formed.\"\n\"...That's true. I understand.\"\nAfter nodding my head, I returned to my room.\n'Marriage. Marriage... Marriage...'\nSeeing everyone talking about it like this, definitely meant that the relationship between Adilun and me looked quite good to others. It was something to be happy about.\nMoreover, it was not even six months away now. We should start preparing soon.\nOf course, after resolving the Northern Monster Invasion.\n* * *\n[Adilun's POV]\n\"Adilun, did you have a good rest in Ortaire?\"\n\"Yes, Mother.\"\n\"Will you tell me what you saw? I'm curious to hear.\"\nMy mother asked about my time in Ortaire. Perhaps because I haven't been away from Rodenov for such a long time before, she wanted to know my impressions.\n\"First... the wheat field was beautiful. It felt like waves of golden color, as if a golden river had unfolded. And...\"\n\"The wheat field? Ah, I know it well. You see, Physis' mother showed it to me when I was young.\"\n\"Oh, did you already know the Countess?\"\n“Didn’t I tell you? That was the main reason you and Physis got engaged.”\n\"Really?\"\n\"We made a promise a long time ago. If she had two children, she would marry the second one to my family. Physis was a boy, and you were a girl, so in the end, you both got engaged.\"\n\"But... originally, didn't you want to compete with other noble families and didn't like him much?\"\n\"That's true. Physis had such a bad reputation. And in the past year... um, I don't want to think about that. It's because he has become so wonderful now, but before that...\"\n\"Ahahaha, that's true.\"\nIndeed, last year's Physis and this year's Physis were completely different people... I understood why Mother had been so worried.\n\"Well... Since His Majesty stopped paying attention to the provinces and we have to find a way to live together, we resorted to this kind of strategy, but it can be said that you two were destined to be together from the beginning.\"\n\"I see...\"\n\"Anyway, so you've had enough sightseeing in Ortaire?\"\n\"Yes. We traveled around here and there, but staying in the castle was still the best.\"\n\"The castle?\"\n\"Yes. You know I don't really enjoy wandering around.\"\n\"That's true. But spending a month in the castle must have been quite boring, right? There wasn't even your magical workshop there.\"\n\"Well...\"\nI couldn't help feeling a little embarrassed to admit that I simply enjoyed being with Physis. Unconsciously, my face turned red, and Mother looked at me attentively, then glanced at my neck, with her eyes widening.\n\"Oh my. What's that on your neck?\"\n\"Oh, this? It's...\"\nI was momentarily speechless. I didn't want to come up with a lame excuse like it was a bug bite. It was a kind of evidence that Physis and I had formed a relationship.\nOf course, it wasn't a proper relationship, after all, we didn't cross the line.\n\"It seems like you had a great time with Physis.\"\n\"...Yes.\"\nI said with a hint of regret, but my mother didn't seem to notice that, and she gave me a slightly mischievous smile.\n\"Hehe. I'm glad to hear that. I was worried when you two didn't get along... I even considered breaking off the engagement. I thought maybe we were just tying together children who weren't a good match because of our greed. But seeing it turn out like this... maybe it was fate.\"\n“Fate…”\n\"By the way, if you had such a good time together... it's about time to start preparing for the wedding.\"\nMother smiled at me and added another word.\n\"Wedding preparations, huh?\"\n\"Yes. It's been a year and a half since you got engaged... It's about time to finalize the wedding. You have overcome the crisis of breaking off the engagement, and now it's obvious to everyone that you two are a lovely couple who support each other.\"\n\"That... Yes.\"\n\"What about you? Do you want to date him a little longer?\"\n\"...Yes. But still, I think getting married would be better.\"\n\"Oh my, why is that?\"\n\"When I visited Ortaire this time, there were hundreds of letters from noble ladies addressed to Physis.\"\n“What?”\n\"It seems they were impressed by his good behavior during the National Foundation Day... And perhaps because of his natural good looks, such attention came his way.\"\n\"My goodness. I never expected him to be that popular.\"\n\"Neither did I. So I was surprised and burned all those letters. Did I do something wrong?\"\nAt my words, my mother shook her head.\n\"No, you did the right thing, Adilun. Whenever there are people clinging to him, you should get rid of them. You can't deceive your instincts, and I know it because I did the same thing.\"\n\"Anyway, seeing that there are many people aiming for Physis... I think it's better to quickly confirm the relationship by getting married.\"\n\"When would you like to have the wedding?\"\n“Six months later.”\n“Six months later… … Alright. Let's take it slow and start preparing accordingly. It's a bit chaotic in the northern region these days, so it might be difficult to do it right away.\"\n\"Chaotic?\"\n\"Oh, right. I forgot to mention this. It seems that the monsters beyond the Frozen Wall are gradually revealing themselves. They must have grown by feeding on people's negative emotions. As soon as Lucas returns from inspecting the Frozen Wall, your father plans to organize a subjugation force to subjugate them.\"\n\"Monsters? Isn't that dangerous?\"\n\"It's too early to determine the exact scale... but it appears to be a problem that needs to be addressed swiftly. Reports from near the Frozen Wall indicate that it is on a larger scale than before... It's a bit unsettling.\"\n\"It's a big problem... Could I be of any help?\"\n\"It seems that this time you also need to step forward. It's not enough to just be enthusiastic and our daughter. There will be many responsibilities that you will have to bear in the future. It wouldn't be bad for you to face those responsibilities on this occasion. So be prepared.\"\n“Yes, Mother.”\n\"Of course, you and Physis will always be together, so you can be reassured about that.\"\n\"Yes...\"\nThe monsters in the northern region... I felt a little melancholy knowing that our peace would be disrupted for a while. However, at the same time, I felt relieved that I could protect the place I love with Physis.\nI have never clearly determined the extent of my own magic... but at least in Rodenov, there was no mage stronger than me, so I could probably be quite helpful.\nLooking back, I was glad I didn't cross the line with him in Ortaire. After all, I wouldn't be able to deal with the northern monsters if I was pregnant.\n\"Well, go now. You probably have things to discuss with Physis. Let's talk more at dinner.\"\n\"Yes, Mother.\"\nI stepped out into the winter garden and headed straight for Physis' room. I felt like there were some things I needed to talk to him about.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 5 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "Chapter 75: Tempered (1)\n[Physis’ POV]\nThe invasion of demons was approaching. Just that the fact alone had my nerves on edge. It was time to start preparing. The time had come for me to improve my skill to the limit. The colossal demon king, born and nurtured on people’s evil spirits, would unleash his power. But in my current state, I couldn’t immediately confront the one who was forming his forces. He was born fully developed, possessing immense strength. A being who leads the army of monsters with the strength he has had since birth. Therefore, it was extremely dangerous. It was not for no reason that he dealt a devastating blow to Rodenov in the original story. In the original story, it was mentioned that he was destroyed due to Adilun’s large-scale magic, the Star of Hope. As a result, my task, in the end, was simple: to buy time until the Star of Hope was completed. However, with my current level of skill, I couldn’t even fight an equal battle with him. I was in a difficult situation in many ways. I didn’t expect that the monster’s attack would happen so quickly. If anything, there was a sense of being slightly ahead. Could it be because of my presence? Because Adilun’s shedding has accelerated? Whatever the case may be... I had to find a way to overcome this situation. Of course, it wasn’t entirely hopeless. The strength of that being remained consistent. In other words, he didn’t grow any stronger. If I had retained the strength from my previous life, what would it have been like? There would have been no need to think about it. I would have just gone and snapped his neck. But now, I had a weak body. Though I was stronger than any knight in Rodenov... it was still not enough to cut that guy’s neck. ‘I have to maximize my strength to be on an equal footing.’ ‘How can I achieve that? No, there’s no time to ponder over such things.’ ‘Given the circumstances, I’ll have to buy some time.’ Just as I was about to get up from my seat... - knock knock. ...I heard the sound of someone knocking on the door. “Physis? It’s me.” It was Adilun. “Come in.” I opened the door, and Adilun looked at me with a slightly gloomy expression. “You heard the news, right?” “Monsters?” “Yes…” It seemed that Adilun was genuinely saddened by the fact that our peaceful everyday life was shattered. “As soon as Sir Lucas returns, we will form a subjugation party, but there is a high possibility that you will be included in the subjugation party as well.” “I already heard that from Your Excellency. I’ll probably be in charge of the knights’ training for the time being.” At my words, Adilun nodded. “And... I’m also planning to join that subjugation party.” “What?” I was taken aback by her response. Adilun was going to join the subjugation party right away? “Wouldn’t that be dangerous? I know you’re good at magic, but… … but you never know what might happen in the subjugation party.” “That’s exactly why I want to go. I can’t just sit still when I don’t even know what might happen to you. Besides, I am the successor of Rodenov, so I should excel in the appropriate field. It’s a decision made by my parents, and I’m determined to abide by it.” Something felt twisted. That was the only way I could describe it. Adilun wasn’t originally supposed to be part of the subjugation party. This was the time when she should be diligently researching magic in her Magic Workshop to complete the Star of Hope... ‘Indeed, my existence must have created various variables.’ From what I briefly looked into last time, it seemed that the conception of the Star of Hope ended earlier than expected after her transformation. Could it be the aftermath? Of course, Adilun’s magical abilities were remarkable, and her inclusion in the subjugation party would significantly enhance our power. She might be able to restrain the advancing monsters to some extent. However, I didn’t feel comfortable about it. I didn’t like the fact that she might face threats. I always wished for her safety. But that couldn’t be the case. She had to move forward. In the end, all I could do... was to protect her to the best of my abilities. “...It’s going to be dangerous.” “I know that much. But I don’t want you getting hurt when I’m not there. I’m good at healing magic too. You saw it last time.” “I don’t want to see you get hurt either. I just wish you could stay safe. But... that’s ultimately my own selfishness. You have to become the rightful successor of Rodenov and prove yourself with great achievements.” “...Yes.” “I know, but it’s inevitable to feel anxious. The battlefield is where countless variables come into play. You could be injured in a surprise attack, or even lose your life if you make a slight mistake.” “I know. I’m anxious too. I don’t want to see you get hurt or... die.” Adilun hesitated for a moment at the mention of death, and her expression grew visibly uneasy. She too was beginning to realize what lies ahead of us, what challenges we would have to face. No matter how powerful the magic she possessed, no matter how strong her abilities were... the variables presented by the battlefield could never be fully controlled. But we couldn’t continue to be consumed by anxiety indefinitely. It would be better to do something, even if it’s just a little. For now, I needed to reassure Adilun and also regain control over my own emotions. “Will you come over here for a moment?” Adilun approached me as I spoke, and I pulled her into a tight embrace. “This is an inevitable event. Eventually, we’ll have to face threats no matter what. Maybe we’ll encounter such threats throughout our lives. So... I will protect you. To ensure that no threat comes your way.” “Me too, I will protect you too. Using the current anxiety as a driving force, I will strive for both of us to stay safe.” “Yes. Thank you.” She also hugged me tightly and said those words. We stayed like that for a while, feeling each other’s warmth.\n* * *\n[Adilun’s POV]\nIt was a warm embrace. In his arms holding me, I felt surprisingly secure. Little by little, the uneasiness that penetrates my heart faded… … replaced by resolute determination. Yes, being afraid won’t change anything. If I was afraid of Physis dying, then I had to make sure he doesn’t. I would use my magic, which I was good at, in times like this. And he won’t die easily. Because he is also very strong. Nestled in his embrace, I heard the sound of his heartbeat. -Thump. Thump. Slowly, my heartbeat and his aligned... and the anxiety completely disappeared. “I’m fine now.” After saying that, I released myself from his embrace. “Yes.” He smiled without saying anything. It was a smile infused with words like “no need to worry.” I returned the same smile to him. “Adilun.” “Yes.” “I need your help.” “What help?” “Starting from tomorrow, I’ll be in charge of the knights’ training. The knights of Rodenov are formidable troops, but the monsters are fierce and go beyond common sense. That’s why we need to strengthen the knights’ capabilities.” “Yes.” “To do that, we must increase their mana reserves and improve their stamina. Increasing stamina can be easily achieved under my guidance, but it’s not the same for mana.” I immediately understood his intention. “You’re asking me to increase the mana concentration within the training grounds.” “Exactly. There’s a greater need for both me and the knights to become stronger. When they have the will and train their bodies to the extreme, mana accumulates in response to that will. However, if the surrounding mana concentration is high, the efficiency increases.” “I know. It’s already incorporated as one of the training methods for the knights, right?” “Yes. So it would be great if you could install magic circles to increase the mana concentration.” It wasn’t a difficult task. Perhaps it was in my bloodline. There would be no one in the empire who could surpass my aptitude for mana. “I understand. It’s a simple task. But...” However, since it was a bit of laborious work, I wanted to ask him for a well-deserved reward. “What will I get in return?” “Is there anything you want? I’ll listen to anything.” “Then... kiss me.” I smiled lightly as I looked at him. I wanted to alleviate his anxiety, even if only a little. Even if I wanted to forcibly eliminate the anxiety, it wouldn’t go away as I wished. “Gladly.” He pulled me by the neck. Our lips meet, overlapping and intertwining tongues without keeping count of how many times they’ve intertwined. Some slightly indecent sounds echoed in his room, but we paid no attention to it. I hoped that the heart of coveting each other would soon be the main driving force to fight in the future… … I longed for his affection. How long we have been like this? We kissed until our lips tingled, and when we opened our mouths, I saw a silvery thread connected from his tongue to mine detached, and his eyes looking at me. It was a gaze filled with determination. Perhaps my eyes weren’t much different from his. “Let’s stay strong for each other.” “Yes, you too.” “Then I’ll go practice magic starting now. The magic I was planning last time, remember?” “Yes.” “I have to complete it. I’ll fulfill your request first tomorrow.” “Thank you, Adilun. Thank you for relying on a fool like me.” “I’m the one... who should thank you for being by my side, Physis.” We embraced briefly and then separated. Just as I was about to leave his room, Physis suddenly grabbed my arm and gave me a short, intense kiss. “Mmm... Ahh...” “This is the end of today’s quota. Practice diligently and stay strong.” “....Yes!” Indeed, the person he was now was someone I couldn’t possibly hate.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL:Hey, everyone! Taylor here.

      "content": "Chapter 76: Tempered (2)\n[Physis' POV]\nThe Next Day:\nI immediately immersed myself in training. Until the subjugation party was established, I had to do whatever it took to maximize my abilities.\nOnce I established the basic skills, which laid the foundation for mana and physical strength, I planned to join the subjugation party and regain my old senses through actual combat.\nI gathered the knights from the morning.\nThe knights followed my instructions without uttering a word, and I informed them that I would guide them in place of Sir Lucas for the time being.\n\"So, are you going to lead us from today, Sir?\"\n\"Yes. This is what His Excellency Johannes instructed. I might seem lacking in your eyes... but I will do my best. The training will be quite demanding.\"\nThe knights' response to my words was quite friendly. Certainly, living in Rodenov and sharing the joys and sorrows with the knights seemed worthwhile.\nThey knew very well that Adilun and I had a harmonious relationship, and it was clear that if things continued as they were, I would assume the role of the next commander of the Rodenov Knights. They had no particular objections to being guided and trained by me.\nFurthermore, they were aware of my explosive growth during this time, so there was no reason for them to refuse.\nThey were probably well aware that the current situation could become quite serious.\nI rigorously trained them, working together with them. I conducted training sessions with much higher intensity than usual, and gradually, the knights' bodies began to show signs of strain, as they were not accustomed to such training.\n\"Move faster! Are you waiting to get hit and killed? Even those who are more proficient in dealing with monsters than me are moving so slowly!\"\nWhenever I saw them struggling, I reprimanded them fiercely. Particularly for those who specialized in battles against major monsters, I stimulated their pride and encouraged them to be more proactive.\nAfter the joint training to develop physical strength, an endless fight against each other unfolded.\nThey were knights with deep expertise in swordsmanship, while I preferred unarmed combat, so I couldn't directly teach them the aspects in which their swordsmanship was lacking.\nIndeed, Sir Lucas would be far superior to me in these aspects, but he was currently absent.\nIn the end, all I could do was sharpen their senses while they trained against each other and cultivate their ability to cope with any situation.\nHowever, this method proved sufficient to improve the knights' skills. At least, the knights of Rodenov quickly identified their shortcomings through sparring.\nThe magic circle that increases the concentration of mana wasn't ready yet, so Adilun said it would be ready by tomorrow.\n\"So, it will be possible from tomorrow?\"\n“Yes.”\n\"You've worked hard. Thank you, Adelun.\"\n\"No, I'm glad I could help.\"\nWhile preparing for any potential threats, His Excellency Johannes and Lady Claudia looked at us with satisfaction as they saw us diligently cultivating our abilities.\n\"I saw how intensely you trained with the knights.\" His Excellency Johannes remarked.\n\"Oh, did you see?\"\n\"Yes. The momentum you created reached where I was standing, so it seems that the training is progressing well.\"\n\"Fortunately, the knights followed my instructions well. To be honest, I had some concerns... but it seems to be paying off because of the work I have done so far.\"\n\"You've done a lot for Rodenov in the past few months. With this, we can be relieved of the worries about Sir Lucas' absence for the time being.\"\n“It’s an overstatement.”\n\"Not at all. It's all because of your hard work. It's good that Adilun is devoted to magic research, but both of you, remember to take breaks occasionally.\"\n\"I will take care of it myself. I'm increasing the number of magic types that can be used because we don't know what might happen when I join the subjugation party.\"\n\"Yes, well done. As soon as Sir Lucas returns, we will organize the subjugation party, so keep that in mind.\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Yes, Father.\"\nAnd the next day, finally, the magic circle designed by Adilun was laid out in the training ground.\nGradually, mana from the surroundings gathered around the magic circle, and a cold and chilling mana settled in the training ground.\n\"Is this sufficient?\"\n\"It's enough. You really did a great job.\"\n\"Then train hard. I'll be in the magic workshop, so come there after your training.\"\n“Yes.”\n“So then where is my reward?”\n\"There are many eyes watching...\"\n\"So what? Everyone in Rodenov already knows.\"\nHaving said that, Adilun put her arm around my neck and kissed me.\nHeat surged through my face. I could hear the whistles from the knights who had been watching us from behind. They looked at us with curious eyes, and as soon as Adilun saw that, she stuck out her tongue at me and teleported away to the magic workshop.\n\"Oh, when did you become so passionate?\"\nIt was Tir. When we first met, he harbored hostility towards me like a sharp blade, but now we had become quite close.\n\"It's been a while.\"\n\"It's truly fortunate. It's good that Rodenov's future looks bright.\"\n\"For now, it's a matter to think about after we finish subjugating the monsters... But I feel a sense of novelty too.\"\n\"Well, until last year, I thought it was something that couldn't happen.\"\n\"What's good is good.\"\n\"I hope your relationship remains harmonious in the future as well. That way, Rodenov will prosper, and my salary will increase as well.\"\n\"Aren't the knight's salaries sufficient?\"\n\"They are sufficient, but isn't it better to have more money if possible?\"\n\"That's true... Anyway, I understand. We'll consider a salary increase after this subjugation battle.\"\n\"Oh, really?\"\n\"The same goes for other knights, it's not just for you. If you feel it's insufficient, let me know. I'll deduct it from my expenses.\"\n\"I suppose being the son of the wealthy House of Ortaire has its advantages.\"\n\"There's no use for it anyway.\"\n\"Well, there's no need to add expenses. You can use that money to buy a gift for Lady Adilun. She will probably be delighted.\"\n\"I already have a gift in mind for Adilun.\"\n\"That's good then.\"\n\"Well, enough chit-chat... Adilun has already laid out the magic circle, so let's get into serious training. Everyone, gather!\"\nThe knights who had been whistling while watching Adilun and me from behind quickly lined up at my call. As refined knights, there was no flaw in their attitude.\n\"For now, should we start with what we always do? Begin with stamina training, then proceed to combat training. Since the mana concentration has increased through the magic circle, always be aware of mana and move with your own will.\"\n\"Yes!\"\n\"Great. Then, let's start by running in the training ground.\"\nThe knights and I sprinted at full speed, pushing our stamina to the limit. As we circled the training ground, our breathing started to get a little rough. After that, we proceeded to strength training and immediately engaged in combat, pointing swords at each other.\nA large-scale chaotic battle broke out as we clashed with our swords, aiming for each other's openings. Even if we were injured, it wouldn't be a significant problem in Rodenov, as there were many skilled priests and magicians available to tend to injuries.\nThe more intense the training was, the faster we became stronger.\nTir swung his sword fiercely toward me. Judging from the mana shimmering with a chilling aura, it seemed that he was determined to thrust his sword into me today.\nHowever, it was out of the question. I immediately parried his sword and pulled him into my range. Maybe in the past, it would have been different, but now I was more skilled than anyone here. Tir exerted all his strength, but in the end, he received a blow from my iron fist and flew far away.\nAs Tir flew, the next two knights launched a combined attack, aiming for my sides. However, I readjusted my posture faster than them and defended against their strikes using mana-enveloped gauntlets.\n- Clang\nThe sound of swords and gauntlets colliding echoed, and I didn't miss the opportunity.\nStepping forward, I delivered a powerful punch to the knight on the left, whose recovery was slow. He couldn't regain his balance due to the recoil from his blocked strike and had no choice but to take my punch head-on, staggering away just like Tir did.\nAfter pushing away that knight, I quickly stepped sideways, evading sword strikes that were directed at my back.\nAnother knight, whose attack was just blocked by me, launched a thrust similar to a lightning strike, and I caught it with my gauntlets after grasping the trajectory of his sword.\n\"...!\"\nThere was a brief moment of confusion, but he was also a skilled knight. Releasing his sword from my grasp, I transitioned into close-quarters combat.\nThe knight, who had previously asked me to teach him close-quarters combat skills, skillfully threw punches at me. However, taking advantage of the same position from when I caught his sword, I struck his shoulder with the hilt of my sword.\n-Crunch!\nA resounding noise filled the air as his armor deformed. Unable to endure the intense pain, the knight collapsed.\nHowever, I could still see knights engaged in battle around me, and it seemed like some of them were paying attention to me, the one who had already taken down three knights.\nA smile crept upon my lips. They knew it too. Who was the most threatening here, and who would be the most helpful for their training?\nI welcomed their challenge with open arms.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

However, I could clearly feel mana flowing through my body.\nPerhaps the knights also realized this, as their expressions were not as bad as the groans they made.\nWith this level of progress... It seemed possible to at least complete the minimal preparations before the subjugation party was formed.\n\"This... the effect is remarkable. I can clearly feel mana flowing through my skin.\"\nEven Sir Tir, who had fallen out with me at first, realized that the magic circle installed by Adilun was remarkably effective, and spoke those words.\nOf course, he fell out at first, he got up and defeated the other knights. Still, he was quite skilled\n\"We will have to thank Adilun later.\"\n\"That's only natural. But to install a magic circle that increases the concentration of mana... I didn't know she could do something like this. If I had known, I would have suggested it to her earlier.\"\nI tilted my head at Sir Tir's words. The reason Adilun was able to install this magic circle was because her magic skills had grown thanks to the influence of shedding.\nAt the time of transformation, Adilun herself was too overjoyed to realize this fact alone, but she did mention that she achieved remarkable magical accomplishments while training at the Magic Workshop...\n\"That's probably not it. Adilun mentioned that her magical power has increased since the transformation.\"\n\"Ah, I see. Even so, if this trend continues... It won't be difficult to subdue the monsters. We've only trained for a day, and to experience such a sense of growth... I have always been skilled at hunting monsters, and if I can achieve this level of growth...\"\n\"Well, that might not be the case.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"It may be easier than expected, but it could also be harder. The exact details will only be known when Sir Lucas returns.”\nSir Tir, who was tilting his head at my words, soon nodded. He must have underestimated the monsters himself.\n\"I guess so. We should always approach monsters with caution. I was too hasty.\"\n\"It's still an uncertain matter, so it's best to thoroughly prepare, Sir Tir.\"\n“Alright, Sir Physis. Thank you for your hard work.\"\n\"Thank you.\"\nAfter shaking hands with the knights, I immediately went to my room and freshened up before heading to Adilun's room.\nI knocked on the door, but I couldn’t hear Adilun’s voice yet. Apparently, she was still in the magic workshop.\nI made my way straight to her magic workshop.\nSure enough, I could feel Adilun's presence from inside. When I entered the workshop to check, she had her hair styled in the same way as before, revealing her alluring slender neck.\nAdilun always looks beautiful, no matter how she styles her hair... Even so, I couldn't help but think that this hairstyle suited my taste the most.\nAnyway, she was deeply engrossed, examining various books in that state.\nShe seemed so focused that she didn't notice my arrival. Wanting to surprise her, I stealthily approached and suddenly embraced her by the shoulders.\n\"Adilun.\"\n\"Ah! Physis?\"\n“What are you looking at so intently? It's almost time for dinner.\"\n\"Ah... I was just looking at this research I was working on before. I was about to put it away after looking at this. Is your training all finished?\"\n\"Yes. Thanks to you, my training efficiency has improved drastically.\"\n\"I'm glad I could help. How do the knights react?\"\n\"They couldn't help but feel amazed. They could clearly feel mana flowing through their bodies. It was a bit overwhelming. They all thanked you.\"\n“Hehe. Then give me my reward.”\n“If it’s a reward, are you talking about this?”\nI gently pressed my lips against hers as she slightly turned her head. The expression of affection, which never gets tiresome no matter how many times we do it, always fills my heart.\nAdilun, seemingly sharing the same sentiment, closed her eyes and focused on meeting my lips. After a while, I pulled away slightly and looked at her expression. I saw a satisfied smile on her face.\n\"Well, this should be enough. Let's go eat. Everyone waiting for us.\"\n“Yes.”\nAs Adilun got up from her seat, I grabbed her hand and interlocked our fingers.\n\"This is nice too.\"\nHer bashful smile was so lovely that a smile naturally formed on my own lips.\n\"I hope this situation ends soon. Then we can be together all the time...\"\n\"Well, if we're both part of the subjugation party...\"\n\"That's true, but I don't plan on dating in such circumstances.\"\n\"I feel the same way. We have to choose the right time and place, don't we? Don't we?\"\n\"Yes, we do.\"\nAlthough we didn't have many instances where we could choose the time and place, thinking about it, we didn't really need to. We just needed to focus on serious matters.\nThanks to the effect of Adilun's deployed magic circle, I had a certain level of confidence. If we maximized the efficiency of the magic circle, combined it with intensive training, and engaged in proper practical combat as part of the subjugation party... I was convinced that we could defeat the king of monsters.\nNo, we had to. What was my reason for staying here? What was my reason for living as a person of Rodenov?\nIt was because Adilun could only be happy if the people here were happy. Her deep affection for Rodenov was evident in her attitude and every word she spoke.\nEven when she came to Ortaire, she started by saying how good Ortaire's scenery was, but ultimately, she praised Rodenov as the best... and she even expressed her fondness for the people of the place she lived.\nHer love for the region was evident in every action she took. It didn't need to be said how special this place was to her.\nSo, I had to protect it. The daily life here and her peace.\nWhat was the reason I had caught the black dragon that had brought destruction to countless countries in my past life?\nWasn't it because I was moved by her story? So... it was time for me to create a foundation that would make her happy, just as she had done for me.\nNo matter how powerful the king of monsters may be... it surely wouldn't be as strong as that gigantic dragon. Of course, I would have to see it for myself, but there was no need to be overly scared.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nEven during dinner, the atmosphere was not much different from the daytime. It was evident that His Excellency had witnessed the knights' intense training throughout the day and seemed quite satisfied with it.\nFurthermore, when I mentioned that Adilun had installed a magic circle to increase mana concentration, I could see a surprised expression on his face.\n\"That... happened right after the transformation. I didn't know the details, but should I say that flashes of inspiration gradually increased after the transformation? My affinity for mana also significantly improved.\"\n\"Things have worked out well in many ways. It's truly fortunate. I believe you will be of great help in the upcoming subjugation.\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"I received word that Lucas will be arriving soon. However... according to the news he relayed, this monster attack seems to be of considerable scale. It's not the usual size of monsters that appear. If we make the slightest mistake, we may have to seek help from the central forces.\"\n\"The central forces? Will they actually send support?\"\n\"They are cautious. There are more than a few who would be pleased if Rodenov were weakened... but if Rodenov collapses, they won't be able to ensure their own security, so they will likely send support. The best scenario would be for us to stop them without any casualties... I'm not sure. We'll have to wait for the situation to unfold. For now, we have requested support from the central forces.\"\n\"What was the response from the central forces?\"\n\"They said they understand for now. But how things will actually turn out...?\"\n\"We should prepare the subjugation party in advance, right?\"\n\"That's right. So, we're preparing the subjugation party in advance, and as soon as Lucas arrives, we will immediately set the punitive force in motion.\"\n\"Understood, Father.\"\n\"I understand.\"\n“I know you two are struggling quite a bit, but please cheer up a little. I will also do my best to prepare.”\n\"Yes.\"\nWe nodded solemnly, and dinner came to an end.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nAfter dinner, I bid farewell to Adilun and was about to turn back to head to the training grounds. However, I heard Adilun's voice calling me to stop.\n“Physis.”\n“Yes?”\n\"Are you heading to the training grounds right now?\"\n\"Yes. I feel like... I need more training.\"\n\"Then let's go together. I think I also need to build up my stamina.\"\n“Stamina?”\n\"Yes. If I'm part of the subjugation party, I can't expect to be treated as a noble lady. So, I think it's necessary to at least build up some stamina, right?\"\n\"Well, that's true... But won't you get tired?\"\n\"It's okay. Everyone is putting in effort, so I can't be the only one resting.\"\n\"Then... okay. Let's go together.\"\n\"Yes!\"\nAdilun came up to me and linked her arm with mine. It seemed like... it was not only about building stamina, but she also wanted to spend time with me.\n\"Tell me the truth, more than building stamina, you just want to be with me, right?\"\n\"Hehe. Yes, that's right. If the subjugation starts... we won't have time for this.\"\n\"...I see.\"\nI wrapped my arm around Adilun's shoulders, pulling her closer, and we walked towards the training grounds together.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "Chapter 78: Tempered (4)\n[Adilun’s POV]\n“Haaaah... Haaaaah”\nRagged breaths escaped from my lips involuntarily.\nIt had already been an hour since Physis and I started running in the training grounds. I could truly feel how rigorously the knights were being trained.\nI felt tired, and my legs were starting to lose strength, but I didn’t stop. Once I joined the subjugation party, I would face even harsher situations, and there might be instances where I needed to conserve mana.\nIf I relied too much on magic, I could easily find myself unable to cope with unexpected events. Although dragons were said to have unlimited control over mana, as a human with dragon blood running through my veins, I couldn’t enjoy infinite mana.\nIt was true that I possessed an overwhelming amount of mana, but it wasn’t infinite, so there would inevitably be moments when my mana ran out.\nTo prepare for such situations, I had to conserve mana without fail, and eventually, the time would come when I had to push my pitiful body to its limits.\nThere was still some time before the subjugation party was formed, so I had to build up my stamina until then... at the very least.\nBut in the end, my legs gave out.\n“Adilun, are you alright?”\n“Uh... yes.”\nI forced myself to say that I was fine, but Physis immediately understood from my expression that I wasn’t okay.\n“Let’s take a break. You’ve been running for quite a while. If you can keep up with my pace for an hour, your... basic stamina is remarkably good. Even well-trained soldiers can’t run like that.”\n“R-Really?”\n“Yes. It seems like the dragon blood flowing through your body has manifested a little more... Did you always have such good stamina?”\n“No, I’ve never exerted myself so vigorously before, so I didn’t know the details.”\n“With this level of basic stamina... if you put in a little effort, you’ll be able to keep moving without getting tired during the subjugation party’s activities.”\n“I’m relieved...”\nUpon Physis’ encouraging words, I slumped down in my place. Physis followed suit and sat beside me, gently patting my head as if praising my efforts.\n“You’ve been through a lot.”\n“It’s only you who undergoes this training every day.”\n“Hahaha, is that so?”\n“To be honest, I understand now after running in the training grounds today. How much effort our knights put in... It was incredibly challenging.”\n“Because that’s what we’re supposed to do.”\nHe spoke calmly and looked at me very affectionately, gently stroking my hair. I couldn’t help but think how amazing he and the knights were as I leaned into his touch.\n“Just the fact that you work hard at what needs to be done is remarkable. Honestly, there are times when I get distracted while doing the tasks assigned to me... You and the knights train rigorously every day.”\n“It’s inevitable. If we don’t train rigorously, we’ll be killed.”\n“Ah...”\n“Well, that’s partly a joke... Actually, it’s because we receive corresponding rewards. I think what you’re doing to become an excellent successor, wrestling with various documents and practicing magic late into the night, is more remarkable.”\n“As I mentioned earlier, do you find time for other things in between?”\n“As humans, we need some rest, don’t we? We also have our own resting time. In fact, I think what you do is even more impressive. I’ve heard that you handle the tasks that His Excellency takes care of as well.”\n“That’s true. Maybe once this incident is over, I might start receiving proper successor training.”\n“Is that so?”\n“Yes. And maybe... as soon as the successor training is over, my father will pass down the duchy to me. He has been thinking of resigning from the duchy and traveling with my mother for a long time.”\n“Hahaha. My father was like that too.”\n“Count and Countess had a good relationship, right?”\n“That’s right. Considering how nobles used to engage in extramarital affairs as if it were a daily routine... it’s quite a rare case.”\n“That’s true. And come to think of it, in other territories, problems caused by extramarital affairs often arise. Issues like illegitimate children...”\n“Let us not do that.”\n“Heh. If you ever do that, I’ll kill you and then kill myself.”\n“...Don’t say such scary things. And I would never betray you. Besides, my gaze doesn’t wander to other women in the first place.”\n“Really?”\n“Have you ever seen me divert my attention to someone else, leaving you aside? I’ve always looked at you, except for when I had to dance with Princess Lobelia during the National Foundation Day.””\n“Let’s not talk about that.”\nI spoke to him with a slightly annoyed expression. In any situation, at any time... I didn’t want to hear another woman’s name coming out of his mouth.\n“Ah... Sorry. I was thoughtless.”\n“No, it’s not that serious... It’s just that thinking about it at that moment put me in a certain mood.”\n“I see. You must have been quite upset then.”\n“...Yes.”\n“Don’t worry. I’ve never felt any romantic attraction toward other women even then.”\n“Yes. I’ll trust you.”\n“Anyway, do you want to run a little more, or should we call it a day?”\n“I want to run a little more. But, could you keep doing this for a little longer?”\nSaying that, I nestled into his embrace. I buried my back into his chest and held his strong arm around my waist.\nThe intense warmth made my whole body pleasantly tired. It was comfortable. I wanted to stay like this forever.\n“As much as you want.”\n“Thank you. Oh, speaking of infidelity... When do you want to get married?”\n“Right now.”\n“Let’s skip unrealistic talk.”\n“Well, if that’s not it... how about in six months? It seems suitable when the deadline we promised each other ends.”\n“I feel the same way. That works out well.”\n“Marriage, huh...”\nHe seemed to have some renewed thoughts as he lifted his chin from my head and looked up at the sky.\n“Will I be able to do well?”\n“We’ll both have a lot to learn. But as my mother said, marriage is about complementing each other’s weaknesses and growing together.”\n“Indeed.”\n“As long as we have trust in each other and don’t betray one another... I believe we can overcome anything.”\n“Yes. I hope it comes soon.”\n“Me too. We should... finish what we started last time, right?”\nI tilted my head back and smiled teasingly at him.\n“Hahaha... You might faint, you know?”\n“Well, I won’t know until I try. Actually, today’s run and the subjugation party... they are also preparations for that. To endure with your monster-like stamina, I also need to have some level of stamina...”\n“Aren’t you often saying things that are too embarrassing?”\n“Well, what’s wrong with that? It’s just the two of us anyway. Oh, by the way, how many children would you like to have?”\n“...The more, the better.”\nI laughed softly at those words and nodded my head.\n“That matches my thoughts. Well, shall we start running again?”\n“Sure.”\n“Let’s go.”\nI stood up from his embrace, glanced at the sky for a moment, and then looked ahead.\nIt was time to run.\n* * *\n[Physis’ POV]\nI watched Adilun as she ran.\nWearing clothes that were somewhat tight to the body for training and running hard to build up physical strength, the appearance of Adilun had remarkable beauty in itself.\nIt wasn’t just about her physical appearance or the curves of her body; her determination and effort were admirable.\nThose who put in effort always shine.\nAnd even more so, someone who strives in an area that is not their expertise, fearing they might inconvenience others... they alleviate the suffering of others to that extent.\nSo I should also strive harder. So that no one, not a single person living in this land, will have to mourn the loss of a precious person. So that Adilun won’t have to experience sadness because of that.\nI thought as I followed behind Adilun, running at a slower pace.\nAdilun continued to run, even as her breath became heavy. What kind of future does she envision? And how will her happiness be fulfilled within it?\nI was curious about that.\nIf I stayed by her side and observed that scene, what would I feel?\nIt was still a story of an unknown future, but I could only hope.\nThat our future... moves in the ideal direction that we both envision.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nFrom the next day onward, Adilun and I continued our training. The surprising thing was that Adilun’s stamina was increasing noticeably.\nPerhaps it was due to her dragon bloodline. Even during our run today, she didn’t show any signs of fatigue like she did yesterday.\nBoth she and I felt a sense of disbelief at that fact.\n‘Is this really okay?’\nIn addition to that, I even gave her some instructions on the martial arts I use. At least she should have the basic self-defense skills.\nAnd... more than just her stamina increasing quickly, I was astonished.\nAdilun’s rate of growth was extraordinary.\nIt was as if she wasn’t someone learning martial arts for the first time; she easily followed my movements. It wasn’t just mimicking the motions.\nShe replicated not only the movements but also the distribution of power and the principles of how to strike the opponent more forcefully.\n“Haha.”\nAn incredulous laugh escaped me. It didn’t matter to me, but if other knights were to witness this, they might feel that the world is truly unfair.\n“Why?”\n“Well, just... because the world seems so unfair.”\n“What?”\n“Oh, nothing. Adilun, try not to show your martial arts skills to others as much as possible.”\n“Of course. It’s more effective to keep things like this hidden.”\n“Yes...”\nWell, maybe it was better to have something good after all.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "Chapter 79: Subjugation (1)\nAfter about a week, Lucas finally returned to Rodenov.\nThe reason for his delayed return was the sudden appearance of monsters between the Ice Wall and Rodenov.\nLucas deemed those monsters dangerous, so he rushed towards Rodenov, trying to reduce their numbers as much as possible.\nEven though there was a teleport gate near the vicinity of the Ice Wall, he didn’t use it for a reason; Apparently, only the Ice Wall had a teleport gate, so he believed that the people living between the Ice Wall and Rodenov wouldn’t receive timely support. If even a brief moment passed, those villagers would be swept away without a doubt.\nThanks to his efforts, a significant number of people were able to escape from the monsters’ harm, and as soon as he judged that the situation with the monsters was under control, he immediately returned to Rodenov.\n“So, that’s what happened. You’ve worked hard, Lucas.”\n“I apologize for being late, Your Excellency.”\n“No, there is no need to apologize. You acted with the well-being of Rodenov’s residents in mind. There’s nothing to reproach you for.”\n“Thank you for your understanding.”\n“Still, you arrived at the right time. The knights are all prepared, and Physis and Adilun are ready too... Now we just need to confirm the members of the subjugation party and head to the Ice Wall.”\n“Will the Princess also go?”\n“Of course. She is the future ruler of Rodenov, and now it’s time for her to step forward.”\n“…Wouldn’t that be dangerous?”\n“There might be a possibility... However, I bet that she won’t be harmed. She possesses the blood of dragons more than anyone recorded in Rodenov’s history. Can anyone in this empire boast better magical skills than her? I think not.”\n“I see.”\n“Moreover, we have Physis as well.”\n“That’s true...”\nLucas nodded, recognizing that Physis’ growth was on an extraordinary level. Among the many geniuses he had encountered, Physis was beyond comparison.\nAs each day passed, Physis’ strength increased at an astonishing rate. This was the reason why Johannes was not particularly worried, and Lucas understood his reasoning.\nImmediately, Lucas recalled Physis’s recent display of power. He had become significantly stronger since the duel they had, now even surpassing Lucas himself in strength.\nWhile someone with even a modicum of talent might feel envious, in the realm of talents high above the sky, it was not something to be jealous of.\nBesides, Physis was destined to become the future Duke of Rodenov. Naturally, it was a cause for celebration to have such a capable person as a knight.\n“Anyway, don’t worry too much.”\n“I understand.”\nAfter finishing the conversation with Duke Johannes, Lucas immediately headed to the training grounds.\n* * *\nUpon arriving at the training grounds, Lucas couldn’t believe his eyes. Even though he hadn’t been away for too long, the knights’ momentum seemed even more vigorous, and their magic power had noticeably increased.\nHe approached Tir, who welcomed him back, and inquired about the sudden improvements and the kind of magic Physis had employed.\n“What exactly happened? It looks like the knights’ abilities have suddenly soared.”\n“Your thoughts are correct. Sir Physis and Lady helped us in many ways.”\n“How exactly did they help?”\n“Feel the mana once, Sir Lucas.”\n“Mana?”\nLucas focused his mind, and what he experienced next left him utterly astonished.\n“...Was the mana concentration in the training grounds always been this high?”\n“Haha. I knew you’d be surprised too. It’s amazing, isn’t it? It’s the effect of the magic circle she installed.”\n“I’ve never heard of such a magic circle...”\n“I heard they thought it was worth a try. And as it turned out, it worked splendidly. Truly fitting for someone with the blood of dragons.”\n“Wow.“′\nLucas was speechless. What had happened during the three weeks he was away from Rodenov?\n“Okay, but what about everyone’s training?”\n“Well, um... Everyone trained intensely, almost like savage warriors.”\n“Intensely?”\n“Yes. Sir Physis advised us that we wouldn’t need delicate swordplay for the time being, as we couldn’t predict the chaotic situations the subjugation party might face. So we swung our swords at each other relentlessly, training our stamina to the point of exhaustion. We rolled desperately to avoid being hit by other knights’ swords. That’s how we ended up like this.”\n“...I see.”\nLucas instantly grasped Physis’ intentions.\n‘If the mana concentration is higher, the body absorbs mana more efficiently during intense training. In other words, he must have known that the total amount of mana accumulated in the body would increase. Moreover, he probably assumed there might be no real combat in the prepared state... Now I understand. There’s no substitute for real battle training. Rodenov’s knights have all honed their individual swordsmanship and combat skills, so he must have found a way to maximize that.’\nLucas nodded and replied to Tir.\n“I understand, Sir Tir. You’ve all worked hard.”\n“Well, thanks to that, our skills have improved a lot... It wasn’t easy, but it wasn’t too bad. Sir Physis had it the hardest.”\n“Physis?”\n“Yes. During the chaotic training, we all targeted Physis first. We considered him the most formidable opponent. Even so, he stubbornly held his ground until the very end. Honestly, it’s hard to believe he’s only twenty.”\n“Hahaha. That’s true.”\n“It’s amazing how much a person can change in less than a year.”\n“That’s right. It’s just... all good things happened. Anyway, I’ll head in now. I need to relieve some tension.”\n“Please go ahead, Sir Lucas.”\n* * *\n[Physis’ POV]\nLate at night at the training grounds, Adilun and I continued our training until the last moment, following Duke Johannes’ instructions to prepare for the subjugation party heading to the ice wall tomorrow.\nOf course, we didn’t train at full intensity, knowing we would need to depart promptly, but I needed some time to review what Adilun had learned from me.\n“Adilun, did you hear? Tomorrow, we’re forming the subjugation party and heading to the ice wall right away.”\n“Yes, I heard from Father earlier.”\n“Sir Lucas has returned... Now the real action begins.”\n“...Yes.”\nAdilun appeared slightly uneasy. She claimed to be fine, but her lingering anxiety probably stemmed from her caring nature. She always hoped no one would get hurt.\n“Are you worried?”\n“...Yes.”\n“It’ll be alright. Don’t worry too much.”\n“Sir Lucas mentioned encountering a considerable number of monsters during his journey. The monsters themselves aren’t frightening, but the consequences they might cause scare me. If Sir Lucas had been late, I might have heard such news - villages disappearing due to monster attacks. I... hate that.”\n“That’s why we’re going as the subjugation party, Adilun.”\n“I don’t want to see the knights or the soldiers getting hurt. But... there’s no doubt that such a situation might arise.”\n“...True.”\n“So, I’ll do my best. You, too... will you do your best?”\n“Of course. This place feels like my hometown now.”\n“...Thank you. Actually, I’m still anxious, but I feel relieved knowing you’re here.”\n“It’s an honor to hear that.”\n“Physis.”\n“Yes?”\n“Please don’t get hurt.”\n“Gladly. But Adilun, can you forgive me if I get hurt while trying to protect you?”\n“No, I won’t forgive that either. So, please don’t get hurt. I can take care of myself to some extent.”\nAdilun looked at me with determination. The deep affection in her eyes showed she genuinely cared about my well-being.\n“...I’ll keep that in mind.”\n“When we come back, there’s something I want to tell you, so make sure you finish everything well and come back to me.”\n“Sure.”\nI was curious about what she meant, but I didn’t ask. I knew she wouldn’t answer if I asked now. So, I simply nodded in response to her words.\nAfter finishing our training, Adilun took a deep breath and spoke to me.\n“That’s it for today.”\n“Yes.”\n“Now that it’s like this, I want us to clean up the monsters as quickly as possible, so that there won’t be any threat to Rodenov.”\n“Me too.”\n“So, let’s do our best, together.”\nHer bright smile looked very beautiful. Was there anything more beautiful than someone striving to protect what they hold dear?\nUnintentionally, I reached out and touched her face. It was a reward for her hard training, and at the same time, it was also a gift she gave to me for the nights I worked hard for her.\nAs I placed my hand on her face, she seemed to understand my intentions and slightly closed her eyes.\nHer face drew closer, and I could faintly smell the sweat from her rigorous training, but at this moment, the scent of her sweat seemed to fulfill some of my sexual desires.\nWe kissed. Just like in the past, when we did not cross the line but continued our actions, I caressed her body and explored her lips passionately.\nIt seemed like she also wanted to dispel the uneasiness caused by the upcoming subjugation mission, as she clung to me tightly and kissed me passionately.\nWith each kiss and mingling of our tongues, an audacious thought came to my mind.\nI just wanted to completely cross the line after this mission was over... Such a thought...\nIt was a bold idea, but honestly, I didn’t think I could resist anymore beyond this.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ Announcement: Just published a few chapters of my currently favorite romance novel.

      "content": "Chapter 80: Subjugation (2)\nIt didn’t take too long to form the subjugation party.\nAmong the remaining knights in Rodenov, except for those guarding Rodenov, all the others were mobilized.\nThe number of knights alone amounted to hundreds. In addition to that, there was a large military force of around ten thousand soldiers who were going to support them on the Ice Wall.\nFurthermore, all ten thousand of these soldiers were experienced in subduing monsters. The intense momentum in their eyes was even stronger than that of ordinary knights.\nIf they managed to survive until the end of this subjugation, quite a few of them might receive knighthood.\nAfter all, the rewards for military achievements from monster subjugation in Rodenov were substantial.\nThe departure speech was brief as well. Gathering the massive army of ten thousand soldiers and hundreds of knights, Duke Johannes simply said:\n“What grandiose words do you need? Fight. Win. Protect. Of course, those who perform meritorious deeds will receive appropriate rewards.”\n“Yes!”\n“Go.”\nAnd so, the subjugation party led by Lucas set off toward the Ice Wall.\n* * *\n[Physis’ POV]\nThere was a limit to the number of people the teleportation gate could teleport at once, and it couldn’t teleport an army as large as ten thousand, so we had no choice but to march from Rodenov to the Ice Wall.\nWe could have taken the time to teleport the soldiers gradually, but that might have overloaded the teleportation gate, so we ultimately decided on marching.\nIt was a strong army composed of only strong soldiers anyway, so the road to the Ice Wall did not take too long.\nEven when the monsters launched an attack during the march, there wasn’t a single casualty, so it was clear how well-prepared the soldiers of Rodenov were for monster subjugation.\nEspecially Adilun’s presence made a significant impact on the march.\nWhile we couldn’t use large-scale teleportation due to the number of people, she used various types of magic to make the march of the subjugation party more comfortable.\nShe made their steps lighter and created warm winds to shield them from the cold.\nNot only did she use this magic on several individuals, but the entire subjugation party felt its effects, making their marching speed much faster.\nAdilun’s terrifying magical skills were impossible to ignore. The praises of the knights continued for her, who showed only slight tiredness even after casting magic on a large scale.\nWith the increased marching speed, we reached the Ice Wall much earlier than anticipated, almost twice as fast.\nIn the meantime, the small monsters were naturally subdued as if they were being trampled on by the army.\nAnd of course, there were no casualties.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nI saw the sight of a gigantic wall. A massive wall that had been standing for hundreds of years to stop the monsters pushing from the north, revealing itself before my eyes.\nThe Ice Wall, positioned between two mountain ranges in the north of Rodenov, completely controlled the invasion of monsters, protecting both Rodenov and the Empire.\nFunctioning as a fortress, many soldiers stood guard there every day. The regular stationed forces alone amounted to exactly ten thousand soldiers, and with the mercenaries coming and going, the number reached twenty thousand.\nSince a huge army of twenty thousand was stationed there, a city was formed around the Ice Wall, creating a landscape similar to the fortress city of Caltix.\nDue to the large entertainment district built to boost the morale of soldiers who always faced extreme situations, there were even some soldiers who welcomed being stationed here.\nIt was quite a pleasant place as long as the monsters didn’t invade. Of course, the training was demanding.\nConsidering that it was in front of the land of death beyond the north, where monsters frequently emerged, large-scale deployment of troops was permitted, However, in recent years, monster invasions weren’t as significant, making them more of a financial burden for Rodenov.\nNevertheless, Rodenov’s financial situation wasn’t so dire as to stagger from just that much, so it was fortunate if one could call it that.\nWhen we arrived at the Ice Wall, the fortress commander, Aiden Felstadt, greeted us warmly.\n“Welcome, Sir Lucas. The Princess, and Sir Physis too.”\n“It hasn’t been that long since we last met, has it?”\n“Perhaps for you, but not for these two, right?”\n“Well... that’s true. Anyway, how is the current situation? It’s been about a week since I left, so I assume more monsters have appeared during that time.”\n“That’s right. They keep increasing endlessly. Right now, even 30,000 troops seem insufficient.”\n“Is that so? The rate of increase is much faster than I expected.”\n“In my view... It seems like their king has shown up.”\n“A king, you say?”\n“Yes. Other than that, I can’t explain the scale of that level. I’ve been stationed here for nearly a decade, and despite accounting for all the other monster invasions over the years... this is the largest scale I’ve seen… It’s only been 5 years since the top-level monsters gathered an army and invaded. Even then, it was not on such a grand scale.”\nThe moment I heard Aiden’s words, I could be sure. The king of the monsters, the demon king, who almost half destroyed the north, had indeed appeared.\nAlthough I thought that the story and reality might differ, it seemed they were following a similar course.\nWhether it was fortunate that I had conducted training in preparation for the demon king’s appearance, or just knowing that he had emerged would be a bad thing, I couldn’t say.\nThe two knights maintained stern expressions as we discussed our countermeasures.\n“So, what do we do? If their numbers are so large, it seems impossible for the subjugation party to directly go out and fight.”\n“Indeed. We’ll have to fight the monsters from atop the fortress walls.”\n“Alright...”\n“But there’s one problem... If it’s such a massive horde of monsters, there’s a possibility they could breach the Ice Wall. Especially if their king personally leads them... I can’t even imagine that. Even the highest-ranking monsters alone are so formidable that it’s beyond comprehension.”\n“I remember that time too. It was truly... enormous.”\n“We can only observe the situation for now. Originally, the plan was for the subjugation party to go out and reduce their numbers a bit before retreating. However, if we do that now, we’ll immediately be swept away by the monsters’ tidal wave... It’s frustrating.”\nContrary to my expectations, Adilun, who had been silent, pondered for a moment and then spoke to the two knights.\n“Among the monsters, is there a monster individual that sees through the invisible state?”\n“You mean invisibility? We haven’t tried it, so we’re not sure... But if there are monsters that can sense a presence, they’ll likely expose the invisibility right away.”\n“What if we completely erase one’s presence as well?”\n“...Is that possible?”\n“In the past, I used to leave a trace of my presence, but now I can erase it completely. Wait.”\nAt that moment, the figure of Adilun momentarily disappeared in front of all of us. It was invisibility magic. But there was something different from before. When she used invisibility at the social gathering, I definitely caught her presence… …But right now I could catch nothing.\n“There is no presence. This…”\nWhen I said that, Adilun immediately dispelled the invisibility.\n“Is this enough... for our purposes?”\n“How long can you maintain it?”\n“For up to ten people, about two hours... can be sustained.”\n“Wow. Then...”\nIn an instant, Aiden marveled. Sir Lucas and I nodded in agreement. If she could completely erase the presence of up to ten people for two hours... that meant she could handle a considerable number of high-ranking monsters or even some superior monsters, slipping through their ranks and launching powerful attacks.\nEven just the ten knights could handle high-ranking monsters if they fought together, but they always found it difficult to approach them while being protected by superior and intermediate monsters.\nBut... if we could completely ignore the low-ranking monsters and assassinate just one of them, the monsters would be helpless.\nIf that were the case, we might be able to significantly diminish the enemy’s forces.\nEven with the two-hour time constraint... if it was enough to preemptively block the most threatening attacks when the monsters advanced toward the Ice Wall.\nOf course, Adilun needed to maintain the magic, so only up to nine knights can move. But with Sir Lucas here and me, even with just nine, we should be able to easily dispatch high-ranking monsters.\n“Impressive, Princess Adilun. With this, we can preemptively block powerful attacks coming towards the Ice Wall.”\nAs if the other knights shared the same thoughts as mine, both of them looked at Adilun with admiration.\n“When you launch an attack, does invisibility get canceled or not?”\n“Of course. That’s why I need to accompany them...”\n“Isn’t it dangerous?”\n“Isn’t it even more dangerous if high-ranking monsters and the demon king push through the Ice Wall?”\n“True...”\n“As it’s quite challenging, I won’t be able to use other magic while maintaining invisibility... However, with other knights present, we should achieve a sufficient effect.”\n“Then, based on that, how about moving in a direction that focuses on dealing with the higher-ranking monsters?”\n“I agree. So, Princess Adilun, when should we start the operation?”\n“We don’t need to wait long. Let’s start from tomorrow.”\nUpon Aiden’s question, Adilun answered.\n“Understood.”\n“I’ll choose eight skilled knights for this. Sir Physis, you’ll join as well... of course?”\n“Yes.”\nI nodded.\n--- End OF The Chapter --\n[ TL:Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "Chapter 81: Subjugation (3)\n[Physis’ POV]\nOnce the direction was determined, things progressed rapidly. A swift and efficient assassination team was formed, consisting of ten members, including myself, Adilun, and Lucas. This team was meant to penetrate among the monsters and intercept the monsters of higher rank or higher.\nThe execution was scheduled for tomorrow. Although it seemed nearly impossible to sneak among countless monsters and cut the head of a higher-level monster, we had a powerful magician who could turn unreal into reality.\nThus, we were confident that we could handle the threatening monsters successfully.\nIf monsters suddenly died in a place where there were no enemies, it was obvious that chaos would arise. Confused, the monsters would retaliate against the ones attacking them.\nAlthough the monsters were not highly intelligent, they possessed an innate characteristic of absolute obedience to their leader who leads them.\nThe Demon King must have realized this and established a command structure for the monsters. Only those who followed him would be spared, and he would consolidate the monster’s forces.\nTherefore, if the King’s designated command system were to falter... the monsters would likely fall into disarray.\nSince their leader had been killed, their aggression might turn towards the surrounding monsters.\nAs monsters inherently lacked a sense of collective consciousness...\nThe Demon King would probably need to reassert his dominance or issue new orders to regain control over them.\nThough it might be considered an inefficient army, except for the King, most monsters had considerably lower intelligence. It was only natural for them.\nIn a way, we could be grateful for such traits in them. If monsters, excluding the King, possessed high intelligence... Well, the threat they posed would likely exceed what we were facing now.\nMonsters were not born through natural means, except for extremely rare cases, which were excluded from this discussion.\nThey were born from the accumulation of negative emotions from humans. When the negative emotions in the world gathered at a particular point, monsters would be born. And an example of an extremely rare case was the monster I found during hunting competitions.\nAt that time, the mother monster, who absorbed the negative emotions from the surrounding humans, merely acted as a vessel to give birth to the monsters. It was not a normal process of animals mating and giving birth. So, such cases could be considered extremely rare.\nAnyway, in the end, monsters possessed traits derived from human emotions. Therefore, their actions were largely instinctive, and they showed movements devoid of any sign of intelligence. Of course, this could make them even more threatening.\nAs they acted purely on instinct, the moment they sensed prey, they would rush forward without any hesitation, even if it meant risking their lives.\nBut thanks to Adilun, the situation was quite positive. We could aim for high-level and top-tier monsters while witnessing the monsters tearing each other apart.\nThat was why Adilun’s expression in front of me was quite rather bright. She believed that her presence could be a significant help in this crisis.\nCome to think of it, lately, I had been resolving most of the matters myself. Perhaps she felt the need to do something herself.\n“I’m so glad. I think things have become a lot easier thanks to you.”\n“I’m happy that I could be of help.”\nAdilun said, putting a rather extravagant dessert into her mouth. Here, the Ice Wall was usually quite overflowing with extravagant food. It must have been because a lot of materials from Rodenov were poured here.\nI couldn’t tell if the dessert was sweet, or if it was the situation itself—her being pleased by the fact that she could be of help.\nAlthough I wasn’t entirely sure, seeing her happy made me feel good too. It was much better to see her smiling rather than feeling sad or anxious.\n“The dessert here is really delicious. It feels worth the money spent.”\n“It’s quite surprising for me too. I knew there were all kinds of entertainment here, but I never expected there to be master dessert makers as well.”\n“That… … Because there is a brothel.”\nAdilun began to speak somewhat embarrassedly.\n“Most of the people living in brothels are women… … so they also need their own forms of enjoyment, right?”\n“Well, enjoying something as much as eating is quite rare, after all...”\n“Yes. Anyway, that’s why we opened a dessert shop... well, it brings in quite a significant income.”\n“Uh, um...”\nHonestly, the conversation topic suddenly shifted to the brothel, and both Adilun and I couldn’t help but blush. Although I had been able to get rid of a strong desire the other day… … Since then, I have had a constant longing.\nThe longing to cross the line with her...\nPerhaps it was the same with Adilun because I couldn’t help but notice her eyes as she looked at me from time to time.\n“Um, anyway, let’s change the subject... So, we’ll move as soon as the morning comes, right?”\n“That’s right. Although it might not seem like a significant blow due to the monsters’ size, as the number of high-level and top-tier individuals decreases, various internal issues will likely arise between them.”\n“I’m feeling a bit nervous...”\n“It’ll be alright. Sir Lucas is with us, and I’m here too. Unless our presence is completely detected, we should be fine.”\n“I’ll do my best.”\n“...Yes. Don’t worry too much.”\n“Okay.”\n“Shall we start heading back? To our room. Since we’ve finished eating.”\n“Yes.”\nThe reason I referred to it as “our room”… …It was because the knights around me, who clearly knew that the relationship between me and Adilun had improved, urged me and Adilun to share a room.\nOf course, I didn’t refuse, and neither did Adilun.\nNot because we had any sinister intentions, but because I was concerned that she might spend the night worrying about unnecessary things.\n...Truly.\n* * *\n“Um... Can I go wash up first?”\n“Sure. Just don’t make the same mistake as last time.”\n“Last time... Ah.”\nAt that moment, a mischievous smile appeared on Adilun’s face.\nThe attempt to seduce me seemed to have no intention of stopping even after coming this far, and the charm that was revealed quietly in a mischievous smile was a little dizzy.\n“Should I not wrap myself in a towel this time?”\n“...There’s a limit to how much I can handle.”\nWhen I spoke a little firmly, Adilun pouted.\n“You’re telling me to do that?”\n“Crossing the line would be six months, no, five months from now.”\n“When I think about it... it was ultimately a matter of trust between you and me, right? I trust you completely now. To the point where I won’t be shaken by baseless rumors. Aren’t you the same?”\nI shook my head at Adilun. I could now trust her wholeheartedly. But this was not about trust between Adilun and me; it was about the mess within myself that I hadn’t fully sorted out yet.\nI still hadn’t completely organized my inner self. The remnants of my flawed thinking before I became aware of my past life still lingered.\n“I’ve trusted you since before. The issue now is whether I can trust myself completely.”\n“Hmm.”\n“I’ve been saying it for a while. I was afraid I might hurt you again...”\n“I know.”\nAdilun interrupted my words. Her affectionate gaze was fixed on me.\n“So I am waiting. but… … I didn’t have as much patience as I thought. So, I want you to come to a conclusion quickly.”\n“I’ll keep that in mind.”\n“And one more thing.”\n“...?”\n“Starting a marriage based on trust is undoubtedly great, but it’s also good to work towards a proper marriage while adapting to each other. Honestly, now I can accept even the violent side of you if you ever display it.”\n“… … You shouldn’t say things like that carelessly. I definitely try to be rational in any situation, but there are times when things don’t go my way, and I’m sure it will hurt you.”\n“I decide whether it hurts me or not. Is this what I’m going through?”\n“What if the level of the wound is too much for you to accept?”\n“When I said I trust you... it means I believe that you won’t go that far, even in situations you can’t control. Sometimes, I wonder if you underestimate yourself too much.”\n“I can’t say for sure that I don’t have that tendency.”\n“So don’t worry too much. I… … Because I like the violent side of you that I sometimes see.”\n“Isn’t that too far-fetched?”\n“I said I trust you... and that includes believing that you won’t harm me as much as you think. Even before you changed, Honestly, judging from the way you treated me before you changed, I don’t think it would be strange if you would have beat me right away.”\n“Of course, I’ve done a lot of wrong to you...”\n“Even so. People tend to easily forget their own mistakes, right? But you... you weren’t like that. That’s why I trust you. I trusted myself when I transformed and fully believed in myself, and I can trust you while being with you. Especially after last time... when we had that intimate encounter. Watching you maintain control until the end during that time made me trust you even more.”\n“That...”\n“So, once this situation is over...”\nAs Adilun hinted at something, I could feel my heart beating faster and my breath becoming rough.\n“Eat me.”\n“...Alright.”\nSeeing her smile brightly, I eventually surrendered to her.\n--- End OF The Chapter --\n[ TL:Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "Chapter 82: Take a break\n[Physis’ POV]\nAs soon as I entered the bedroom, Adilun nestled in my arms. Her soft body and the sweet scent began to linger in my nose.\n“Isn’t it a bit of a shame to just go to sleep like this?”\n“Well, it is... But we shouldn’t exhaust ourselves too much, so maybe it’s better to just rest today.”\n“Mm... Is that so?”\n“That’s why, let’s just...”\nI said that and pressed my lips against hers. A kiss that never gets tiring no matter how many times I share it. Softness lingered on my lips, and a dizzying sensation spread through my entire body.\nThis must be what they call ecstasy. Every time I embraced her or our lips met, I felt this ecstasy.\nWell, if I didn’t feel this ecstasy despite having such strong affection for her, it would be a lie.\n“Um...”\nA moan of regret lingered in my ears from slightly parted lips, but I pretended not to notice.\nI pulled her head close and held her in my arms.\nIt was warm.\nThere was no need for any sentiment. The comforting and calming scent began to fill my whole body. I just cherished this moment. Even without sharing our love or locking lips...\nJust holding her in my arms, feeling her warmth, this moment was more precious than any other.\nWords I wanted to keep to myself still circled inside me. The words “I love you.”\nI was afraid if I said it too much, it might wither away someday, or it might lose its impact. It was not an easy decision, but now, facing a battle that might be dangerous, I thought it was okay.\nCarefully, I opened my mouth.\n“I love you, Adilun.”\n“Ah...”\nA stifled moan escaped her lips. Even without looking, I knew what expression she would have right now. Her face must be flushed, with a happy smile, I imagined.\nAs I expected, when she briefly left my embrace and faced me, Adilun’s face showed the expression I had anticipated.\nShe was looking at me with a joyful smile.\n“Do you know what?”\n“What?”\n“This is the first time you said you love me.”\n“...Is that so?”\n“Yes.”\n“Come to think of it... It really is. I’m sorry.”\nAdilun looked puzzled by my words.\n“Why are you suddenly apologizing?”\n“I thought If I say it too often, it might lose its impact... So, I intentionally didn’t say it much.”\n“Lose its impact?”\n“Yes, when words become too familiar, they might not bring the initial excitement anymore. If saying ‘I love you’ becomes that way, it might make me a bit sad.”\n“Hmm... I don’t think that’s the case.”\n“Really?”\n“Yes. If you think you love me, please keep expressing it. Of course, as you said, it might lose some of its novelty, but even if I hear it every day, it will still be a new phrase to me. I believe your words will always have that effect on me.”\n“Then, I’ll say it more often from now on.”\n“Sure.”\n“Now, let’s get some rest. Starting tomorrow, we’ll be quite busy.”\n“...Alright. Still...”\nOnce again, her lips touched mine as softly as a feather, but unlike before, they parted quickly. Adilun, with a slightly puzzled expression, spoke to me.\n“We should always have a goodnight kiss, right?”\n“Haha. Yes. Goodnight, Adilun.”\nI lightly kissed her back, and then turned off the lights in the room.\nIn the room, faint moonlight illuminated us as I held her tightly, keeping her in my embrace while falling asleep.\nIt was the most comfortable sleeping arrangement I’ve had so far.\n* * *\nAs the dawn broke, and the sunlight gradually brightened, my eyes naturally opened.\nWhen was the last time I slept so comfortably? With a joyful sigh, I looked at Adilun, who was always stunning no matter when I saw her.\nQuietly closing her eyes, with a content and satisfied smile on her lips, I could see Adilun’s face the moment I woke up. That alone made me feel good all day.\n“Mm...”\nWith a slight moan, Adilun opened her eyes.\n“Uh... Physis?”\nWith eyes that seemed dazzled, she furrowed her brows slightly. Then, as she finally recalled that we had slept in the same room yesterday, she smiled playfully with drowsy eyes.\n“Did you sleep well?”\n“Uh, yes. Did you sleep well too?”\n“I slept well because of you. So, do you want to sleep a bit more? Everything in our plan depends on your condition...”\n“No, I’m awake now. Sigh...”\n“Really? Then let’s get up and wash up.”\n“...Shall we wash together this time? We’ve already seen each other’s bodies before anyway.”\n“...Sure.”\nAt the morning proposition, I nodded my head. Frankly, how could I resist such a seductive approach?\nThe room we stayed in was one of the best accommodations in the Ice Wall castle. Not only was it spacious, but it also had a large bathtub powered by magic.\nSo... there was more than enough space for the two of us to get into the bathtub together, and because of that, we could intimately touch each other’s naked bodies, something we hadn’t done in a while.\nThe funniest thing was Adilun’s reaction. After seeing my naked body again, she smiled softly. Then, she pressed her body against mine.\nFor a moment, blood rushed to my lower regions, but I managed to restrain myself and got into the bathtub.\n“No matter how I think about it, I think your patience is really amazing.”\nWhen she made a teasing complaint, I could only give an awkward smile.\n“Because we’re not in a situation to do that right now.”\n“Then how are you going to handle all that pent-up energy later?”\n“Well, maybe you’ll know when the time comes. It’s not too far off. When that time comes, you should be prepared.”\n“You should be the one preparing. After all, I asked you to train my stamina to avoid getting tired during the subjugation.”\n‘Huh?’\n“Wait a minute, then you say that you train your stamina in order not to get tired in the subjugation party...”\n“Hehe. I lied. I did mention that I might be lacking in mana, but I have no shortage of mana at all. I simply use mana directly from nature. It’s the most potent ability of a dragon.”\n“...Got me there.”\n“You should be prepared for it, you know? Even with just this much, I have plenty of talent when it comes to using my body.”\n“I know that very well. Dragons are indeed quite an unreasonable existence.”\n“And you hate your dragon fiancée for that?”\n“No way.”\nI suddenly pulled her close.\n“If I didn’t like it, I wouldn’t have hugged you like this.”\n“Hehe, I knew you’d say that.”\n“Seriously, be prepared. Once we get through this, I might not let you sleep for a week.”\n“You should be the one preparing. I don’t plan to leave the honeymoon suite until I get pregnant.”\n“Who do you think will win?”\n“Alright.”\nA small bet began. However, all of these exchanges and jokes were meant to ease the tension about the upcoming monster subjugation.\nEven if we tried to hide all signs, entering the territory of those lurking monsters was quite dangerous. Some of them might even be able to see through invisibility magic.\nBut if we didn’t do it, the Ice Wall wouldn’t withstand the attacks of higher-ranked monsters compared to the numerous lower-ranked ones.\nSo, we needed to minimize the number of adversaries whenever possible.\n“Well, let’s quickly take a bath and then have a meal.”\n“Sure. Oh, do you want me to wash your back?”\n“...Let’s wash each other.”\n“Oh my, how mischievous of you.”\n“If we’re talking about mischievousness, you’ll probably surpass me by far.”\n“Hehe, you caught me?”\n“Actually, since the last picnic, I can’t tell whether you’re a fox or a dragon.”\n“Should I attach a tail next time? A fox tail, or maybe a dragon tail? Well, as the dragon’s blood becomes more evident, who knows, some strange things might happen, and a tail might appear next time. I don’t know much about my own body either.”\n“Any dragon crest?”\n“Ah, that. I can talk about the dragon crest. It hasn’t manifested yet. Maybe once I fully awaken... a crest might appear?”\n“Isn’t the crest a weakness?”\n“It is a weakness, but it’s also like a core that contains the essence of natural magic. From then on, I won’t have any restrictions when using magic. According to the records, the ancestral dragon Altair had a dragon crest in one part of his body, but since then, there have been no dragons with manifested crests.”\n“A weakness that sounds even more dangerous...”\n“Well, yes. But with you around, it should be fine, right?”\n“...Yes.”\nSmiling at each other, we began to gently caress and wash each other’s bodies with great care. Of course, it was excruciating to restrain the desire that surged each time, but I endured it with great effort, knowing that there was something more important waiting for us once this task was done.\nBy the way, in many ways, I couldn’t help but notice how Adilun became more alluring as the days passed. I was starting to wonder what would happen if we took it all the way to marriage.\nAnyway, we finished all the preparations, and after quickly joining Sir Lucas and the other eight knights who were waiting for us in front of the command center, we climbed the Ice Wall Citadel.\nIt was the beginning of the actual subjugation. I sincerely hoped that we would all come out of this unscathed.\nWe would undoubtedly make it happen.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL:Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

Well then, let’s begin.”\nAdilun closed her eyes for a moment and then cast the complete invisibility spell she had previously demonstrated on all of us.\nStrangely, while under the effect of invisibility magic, we could still see each other.\nHowever, as we suddenly disappeared, the soldiers who were seeing us off began to look puzzled.\n“Oh...”\nEven Sir Aidan, who had witnessed this before, couldn’t hide his surprise at the sight.\nAdilun eventually lightened the bodies of everyone, including herself, and made us float in the air, then slowly lowered us down the Ice Wall.\nThere was no sound or trace. We nodded and dashed forward.\nThere was no time to deal with small monsters. We had a time limit of two hours.\nWe planned to use Adilun’s mass teleportation for the return, so we needed to leave some mana for that. Because of this, Adilun agreed to use only support magic for us in advance.\nShe wanted to deal with the monsters using high-powered magic, but that could quickly drain her mana, so I had to console her and make her settle for using less powerful magic.\nWith each step forward, the wind surrounded us, and the scenery around us changed in an instant. The monsters, unaware of our charge, just stood still.\nIt was a fascinating experience. Facing incredibly dangerous monsters right in front of us but feeling no threat at all. At this level, it could truly be called grand magic.\nOur goal was to deal with the high-ranking monsters commanding the other monsters. They were at the superior or near-superior level, and the other monsters couldn’t dare approach them.\nOf course, right now, they couldn’t see us at all. So, dealing with them shouldn’t be too difficult.\nSurprise attacks were always threatening, let alone when the enemy couldn’t see you... The impact of such a surprise would undoubtedly be tremendous.\nI watched the monster’s figure. My eyes pierced through its essence, revealing its weaknesses at a glance.\nMoreover, just in case it reacted to this surprise attack, its retreat route was already blocked by other knights.\nThis should be enough.\nI stepped into the attack stance and infused my fist with mana.\nThe mana resonated and surged into my fist, and my strength grew. At that moment, the top-tier monster started to look around, sensing something strange.\nBut it was already too late.\nBefore it could notice me, I had already extended my fist in front of it.\n- Kwang!\nThe gauntlet, condensed with mana, struck the monster’s chest, and at that moment, its insides burst and exploded due to the mana.\nThe surrounding monsters seemed bewildered by the sudden turn of events.\n“It’s okay. They won’t hear any sound even if we move.”\nAdilun said, floating in the air as she looked at the knights taking battle positions.\nWe quickly moved away from that location towards where other high-ranking monsters were present.\nLooking back slightly, we could see the chaotic monsters losing control and attacking other monsters.\nWatching them rampage, I felt that things were going quite smoothly.\n***\nThe small ripples we caused had thrown the entire monster forces into confusion.\nWhen the monsters no longer followed the commands of the superior monster we initially dealt with, they began to wander around attacking other monsters. It was not just a minor disturbance; it quickly turned into a significant battle.\nSlaughter between monsters had begun. Adilun looked at it and made a slightly regretful expression. Apparently, she wanted to directly pour her magic on the monsters.\nTaking advantage of the chaos, we actively targeted and exterminated the monsters.\nSir Lucas, without the enemy noticing his presence, thrust his sword, imbued with frigid mana, at the superior monster.\nCaught off guard by the sudden sword strike, the monster’s heart was pierced, and the penetrated heart began to freeze.\nIf Sir Lucas could land a blow on the enemy properly, it would be a fatal wound that would lead to an immediate fatality.\nSince he stabbed his sword into the weakness of the monsters I had told him about, the work had to be carried out easily.\nPerhaps it was due to the fact that we were all selected as skilled knights, our battle progressed very smoothly.\nOf course, the enemy couldn’t see us, and we were free from all their senses, so it was only natural that we achieved such results.\n“Gather. It’s time to go back.”\nThe situation was entirely different from what we worried about, and as the scheduled time was coming to an end, we immediately gathered around Adilun.\nJust as the transparency spell was about to be released, at the right time, Adilun’s mass teleportation brought us back to the Ice Wall.\nAs soon as we arrived at the Ice Wall, we realized that Adilun’s transparency spell that enveloped us had ended. The soldiers who were stationed on the Ice Wall looked at us with surprised expressions and then saluted.\n“Thank you for your hard work!”\n“Yes! The monsters are currently engaged in battles among themselves, so there has been no damage on our side of the Ice Wall!”\nIn response to Sir Lucas’ question, the soldier yelled with a tense tone.\n“Great, then let’s return immediately. You guys have endured a lot.”\n“Alright !”\n“Let’s go. Princess Adilun and Sir Physis.”\n“Yes.”\nWe immediately headed back to the command center. When all ten knights returned without a scratch, Sir Aidan looked at us with amazed eyes.\n“...Impressive.”\n“It was all thanks to the princess’ magic. They had no idea where we were, even as their bodies were hacked to pieces by swords. Moreover, after losing their higher-ranking monsters, the monsters started fighting among themselves, and that chaos began to spread throughout their forces. Perhaps only if the king personally intervenes can the situation be brought under control.”\n“I see. It’s hard to believe that all of this happened in just two hours. I can’t even imagine how much the soldiers’ sacrifices will be reduced thanks to this. Anyway, everyone did well. Thank you, Princess, for your hard work as well.”\n“...Yes.”\nSeeing Adilun looking somewhat tired, Sir Aidan seemed to notice it and said to her.\n“Well, you seem quite exhausted. Rest now. Thanks to the magic you performed for two hours, the threat approaching the Ice Wall has significantly diminished.”\n“Then, I’ll go back to my room now.”\n“That’s right. Rest well. You all did a great job.”\n“Yes!”\nThe expressions of the knights who returned from the successful mission were bright.\nSir Aidan felt the same way. Even though the mission was made easy thanks to Adilun’s magic, the battlefield was always unpredictable. So, it was truly a relief that everything ended safely.\nWe headed straight to our room.\n“Thank goodness no one got hurt.”\n“Was it tough?”\n“Uh... not that much, but I’m quite tired. I want to take a bath and sleep right away.”\n“Then, go ahead and take a bath. I think I’ll prepare some light refreshments.”\n“Okay...”\nAs soon as Adilun entered the room, I quickly prepared a simple meal and returned to the room. Although it was only around lunchtime, since we had risen early in the morning, it felt more like evening.\nHow much time had passed? Adilun, who had finished bathing, came out of the room with just a towel wrapped around her.\n“Ah...”\nWith a refreshed expression and a smile, she looked at me with sparkling eyes, as if her tiredness from earlier had disappeared.\n“Are you going to take a bath, Physis?”\n“Of course. I’ve prepared a simple meal, so eat up.”\n“Thank you.”\n“You’re welcome.”\nI quickly finished my bath and came out of the bathroom. Adilun, now wearing a light negligee, was eating the simple meal I had placed on the table.\n“You bathed quickly.”\n“Men are like that.”\n“Huh, really? Anyway, we don’t have any more schedules for today, right?”\n“Probably not.”\n“Hehe. Then, will you spend the whole day in the room with me? I’m not sleepy, but I’m still tired... being close to you would be nice.”\n“It’s my pleasure.”\nWhile having a chatty conversation during the meal, we headed straight to the bed after finishing. Not because we were planning anything intimate, but simply to feel each other’s warmth.\n“Ah, good. Now I truly feel like resting.”\n“Me too. By the way, your horns seem to have grown a bit.”\n“My horns?”\n“Yes.”\n“Hmm... really? I haven’t noticed any significant changes.”\n“I’ve been feeling that way for a while. Aren’t the horns uncomfortable?”\n“No, they’re not heavy, and they’re light. Sleeping isn’t particularly uncomfortable either. Sometimes it’s a bit awkward when they hit something, but I’ve gotten used to it. They’ve been there since I was born, so I’ve always had them.”\n“I see.”\nI nodded as if I understood and gently stroked her horns.\n“Huff... don’t touch them too much. It tickles.”\n“Because you tempt me so much, I want to make you a little uncomfortable too.”\n“If you keep it up, I might just pounce on you.”\n“That sounds very promising. But will you have the chance to pounce on me?”\n“What? Why?”\n“Before you can pounce on me... I’ll have already pinned you down so that you can’t get up.”\n“Hehe, really? Is that a promise?”\n“Even without a promise... it will definitely happen.”\n“I’ll be looking forward to it. Honestly, it’s a bit hard for me to resist too.”\n“That’s the same for me. Once this situation is over, let’s go on a trip together.”\n“Sounds good!”\nWe snuggled up to each other’s warmth and rested comfortably.\nWe wanted to quickly deal with the Demon King and then go on a trip together.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL:Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "Chapter 84: Demon King (1)\nThe demon king suddenly realized that he was born by his own will.\nFrom the beginning, the king was powerful—a massive body without weakness, filled with aggression and strength. He possessed intelligence that was not far behind humans.\nWherever the king went, monsters bowed their heads in submission. It was then that the demon king realized he was the ruler of his own destiny.\nThe king did not tolerate any beings that opposed him and eradicated them. Even the highest-ranking monsters with massive bodies and great strength were helpless against him.\nHe successfully subjugated even the highest-ranking monsters and gradually expanded his territory.\nHowever, the king could not easily surpass the massive wall erected by humans. Nevertheless, he desired to slaughter all humans and feast on their blood and bones.\nOf course, the king knew that humans were formidable beings, so he did not act rashly.\nThe negative emotions that brought him into existence had taught him that humans were fearsome creatures. He began to prepare carefully.\nThe king began to form his forces in earnest. He commanded lower-ranking monsters through the highest-ranking ones he had subjugated and made the monsters born everywhere recognize that he was the king.\nAnd finally, the king became confident that his forces could overcome the massive wall erected by humans.\nThinking that all preparations were finished, he was about to advance.\nSuddenly, a whirlwind of chaos swept through his army.\n* * *\nThe demon king saw his forces in disarray. As someone who had not faced many human enemies, he couldn’t understand why such turmoil had occurred.\nUnlike humans who had fought numerous battles against monsters, the recently born king was ignorant about magic.\nHowever, the king knew that this was not an ordinary occurrence.\nHis army was faltering.\nIt was not a good sign. His goal was to go beyond the massive wall, expand his territory, and devour humans.\nConsumed by rage, the demon king advanced toward the camp where the first skirmish had occurred. His massive and somewhat grotesque body emanated tremendous power.\nWere his forces decreasing? No, they were overflowing with monsters. Instead, he needed to eliminate those who opposed his will and establish a new spirit.\nHe tore apart the monsters who resisted him with the power emanating from his massive body and began to establish a new command system.\nRealizing that he could no longer delay his advance, the king raised a gigantic axe made from his own bones with one hand and stood at the forefront of the highest-ranking and upper-ranking monsters.\nHis strong determination to slaughter humans and go beyond the wall spread throughout the monster army.\nNumerous scales intertwined, and madness began to fortify the bodies of the monsters, strengthening them.\nThe demon king advanced toward the massive wall.\n* * *\n[Physis’ POV]\nUrgent bells rang out in various places.\n“They are advancing!”\nSoldiers who were watching the monsters from atop the wall shouted as if in a scream. Knights, soldiers, everyone took up a combat stance and climbed up the Ice Wall.\nWe had used Adilun’s magic several times to disorientate the monsters, but it seemed that our constant shaking of the monster army had aggravated the king’s impatience.\nAs a result, the number of the monster army had visibly decreased. At this rate, our current troops would be enough to challenge the demon king, especially with Adilun’s presence.\nIt was an army of 30,000, which was unbelievable as the army of a local lord.\nThe size of the army was possible because the Empire was huge, and Rodenov had the most powerful military authority among them.\nUnder the wall, a massive monster broke the ground with its fierce steps and appeared. At the sight of the monster running ahead, everyone immediately recognized who he was.\nHe was the demon king.\n“Fire!”\nSoldiers who had undergone special training drew their bows and released their arrows. The sound of arrows tearing through the air was heard, and the monster hit by the blind arrows fell instantly.\nThe demon king swung his arm powerfully toward the incoming arrows.\n- Whoosh!\nThen, the arrows heading toward the demon king lost their power and scattered in the air in an instant. It was truly an overwhelming force.\nUpon seeing this, the knights also raised their weapons. They knew they had to strike the demon king before he reached their position.\nArrows infused with mana poured down, and flames surged from the ends of the mages’ staffs as they prepared for the monster’s advance.\nFierce flames poured toward the demon king. However, all of the attacks dispersed uselessly, and the demon king approached the Ice wall.\nWith a body about half the height of the Ice wall, skin as hard as steel, and intense aggression supporting him, the demon king lived up to his title.\nIn front of the Ice wall, he swung the massive axe he held in his hand toward the Ice wall.\n“Take cover!”\n- Kwaaang!\nAdilun’s urgent shout resonated through the magic, and at the same time, a deafening roar tore through the heavens and earth.\nA part of the Ice wall was deeply dented by the axe blow just now.\nSurrounded by all sorts of magic, the soldiers had never thought scars would be so easily carved on the Ice Wall, which was unblemished even by the attacks of the highest-ranking monsters. A commotion began to rise from the soldiers who watched the scene.\nBecause they had never seen anything like this before.\nEven amidst numerous monster invasions, the Ice Wall had never been marked by any scars. The fact that it was now wounded was enough to dampen the soldiers’ morale.\n“Halt the demons!”\nSir Aidan’s command echoed down from the wall. Yes, the problem was not just the demon king. The massive monster army following him was also a problem. If they only focused on the king, that fearsome force would break through the Ice Wall in an instant. They needed to stop the monsters first, even if it meant enduring damage to the Ice wall.\nArrows rained down once again. This time, it was an attack ignoring the demon king. The monsters behind him were hit by arrows sent flying by the knights and soldiers, causing their advance to slow down.\nBut that wasn’t all. The mages’ magical attacks were also directed at the monsters. They froze or were cut in half by blades of wind or burned in flames.\nThe demon king swung his axe once again, aiming to split the wall.\nBut at that moment, Adilun chanted her magic.\nA massive barrier appeared between the Ice wall and the demon king.\nThe powerful axe blow aimed at the barrier, but Adilun had poured all her strength into protecting it, making the barrier impenetrable.\nAs I watched all of this unfold, I took a step forward.\nI hadn’t just been standing there doing nothing. I compared my abilities with those of the demon king and calculated if I could confront him.\nThe information that the eyes that could see through essence sent me was simple.\nIt was worth a try.\nIf that was the case, then I had to do it. The only person who could stand against the demon king in this situation was me. I couldn’t simply leave him alone like this; it wasn’t my style to back down from a fight with no chance of winning.\n“Physis?”\nAdilun’s eyes, which had been focused on her magic, widened in astonishment.\n“What are you doing now?”\n“I’ll stop him. You prepare the magic. You’ve been researching it all this time, haven’t you?”\n“...It’s dangerous.”\n“Don’t worry, I won’t die. I won’t stick my neck out in a fight where the odds are against me. You know my personality.”\n“But still...”\n“I’ll buy as much time as I can, so release the barrier and prepare the Star of Hope, Adilun.”\nAdilun nodded firmly, realizing that I wasn’t joking.\n“...Yes.”\n“Don’t worry too much. I’ll be fine.”\n“I believe you.”\n“Good.”\nAs soon as I finished speaking, I threw myself under the Ice wall.\nI surrounded myself with mana and strengthened my body. My physical prowess activated, and immense power surged through my entire being.\n- Kuwoong.\nI landed on the snowy ground below the Ice wall, and at the same time, our gazes met. Then, the barrier that had stood between the demon king and me was released.\nWithout a word, I ran toward him, and he ran toward me.\n- Kwaang!\nAs his axe clashed with my fist, a powerful shockwave erupted. The other monsters didn’t dare interfere in the battle, even though they knew their king was being attacked.\nThey were being bombarded with immense magical attacks. Given the scale of the assault, it had to be Adilun’s magic.\nWhile she prepared the Star of Hope, it seemed she had some spare energy to hold back the monsters. Her magical abilities were more than capable of dual casting.\nI activated my essence-piercing eye to the fullest. I could see where his attacks were directed, how his muscles moved, and the vulnerable parts of his body. All of this information flooded into my eyes.\nHowever, even with this knowledge, there was still a considerable difference in our abilities at the moment. It wasn’t an insurmountable gap, but if I allowed even a single one of his attacks to land, I would likely be seriously injured.\nEven so, I couldn’t let fear hold me back.\nIn my previous life, I overcame numerous dangers with my bare hands. Facing all sorts of perilous monsters, I stood alone without anyone’s help.\nCompared to that, my current situation was much better. So, I could do it.\nAfter bolstering my determination, I charged toward the demon king once again.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL:Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "Chapter 85: Demon King (2)\n[Physis’ POV]\nThe clash of the axe and gauntlet ignited sparks.\nI was pushed back.\nEven though we hadn’t clashed several times, I could tell he was stronger than me.\nIndeed, he could be worthy of the title “king.” Every time his robust axe struck my gauntlet, my arm began to feel numb, but I kept my eyes wide open, closely observing his movements.\nHe retrieved the axe that collided with my gauntlet, but slightly later than I did. Just seeing that, I could instantly tell how powerful he was.\nSwinging and recovering that massive axe required much more strength than extending and recovering a fist. It was probably his sturdy body that allowed him to do such a thing.\nWith each gigantic axe strike on my gauntlet, the impact on my arm grew stronger. Perhaps, I wouldn’t be able to endure this for much longer.\nAt that moment, the monsters broke through the barrage of arrows and magic and approached the Ice wall.\nHowever, they didn’t intervene in the battle between the demon king and me.\nNo, to be precise, they couldn’t intervene. They must have realized how dangerous it was to get involved in our fierce battle, where fists and axes clashed, shaking the heavens and earth.\nThey understood that they would be crushed if they interfered.\nActing purely on instinct, they decided that my battle with the king was risky. Instead, the monsters focused on directly climbing the Ice wall.\nThe monsters with tentacles reached over the Ice wall, while those flying through the air attacked the soldiers positioned above. Some gigantic monsters even assaulted the Ice wall directly, mimicking the actions of the demon king.\nIt was a fierce battle.\nAmidst the chaos, I regained my composure and raised my numb arm, staring at the demon king in front of me. I immediately dismissed the thought that I might not last much longer.\nI abandoned the idea of waiting for Adilun to use the Star of Hope. Since when did I have such weak thoughts? Perhaps, I had been influenced by spending happy times with Adilun. I decided to confront and defeat the demon king without hesitation.\nI recalled the sensations from my previous life, the feeling of fighting against much stronger enemies alone, the memories of battling monsters, knowing I had to kill them or be killed.\nI remembered my final battle with the black dragon. Compared to the pressure I had felt from the dragon’s tail strikes, the intimidation of his axe was not much different from that of a young child. Though my current abilities were far from what they were back then, experience couldn’t be ignored. I faced his intimidation head-on.\nThe axe and gauntlet clashed again, and a spark flew as the sharp edge of the axe struck the gauntlet head-on. Although a strong impact traveled through my fist, I extended the other fist again, overcoming the shock.\n-Thumbbbb\nA powerful sound, like a drum being struck, echoed from my fist as it collided with his hard skin. However, despite the loud noise, it seemed that the impact didn’t affect him much. Nevertheless, I could sense that he staggered slightly.\nIn another instant, I moved away from the position where his axe was about to strike down. The beauty of Fist Martial Arts lay in its fast attack delivery and recovery, allowing me to respond quickly to the attacks of weapon-wielding beings.\nOf course, it also had significant drawbacks, but for now, it was beneficial.\nAlthough the demon king was faster than me, being a living being, he couldn’t completely ignore the impact, as evidenced by his delayed reaction. It could be considered a small victory.\nPerhaps, I should be thankful.\nIn any case, this helped me gain a vague sense of how to deal with him.\nWhat I needed now was not an attack much stronger than his, but the ability to endure his impact and strike back at the right moment.\nBy accumulating these moments, they would eventually become a flow that overwhelms him.\nSo, I must continue to press him, enduring the accumulating impact on my body.\nSeemingly unhappy about being hit by me, he snorted, clenched his axe, and spun his foot.\n- Kuwong!\nHis stance became as solid as a fortress.\nWhether it was due to his natural sensitivity to combat or if he discovered his own weakness when he allowed my previous attack, I didn’t know. But indeed, he found an answer and overcame it. It was not something easy to witness. In my past life, I rarely encountered an opponent who could achieve such objective self-awareness.\nBeing born from the accumulation of negative emotions in humans might be the reason for his sensitivity. Especially, he seemed very responsive to the grudge I held against him.\nIn other words, even if I saw through his actions with my eyes that see through the essence, he could still quickly respond to my attacks fueled by my grudges.\nIn various ways, he was an annoying opponent. He was well aware of the strength of his body and how to utilize it, as well as being adept at reading his opponent’s intentions.\nSeeing a monster performing feats that would normally only be seen from a master of combat, I could tell that he didn’t become the king of monsters for no reason.\nBut then, in a moment...\n- Quaaang!\nA powerful storm of flames began to sweep the demon king away. Along with that, vitality gradually surged in my body. I briefly raised my head and looked up at the Ice wall.\nThere, Adilun, who was looking at me with a worried expression, was casting support magic. The vitality swirling around my body began to increase explosively.\nAs expected, the sight of her worrying about me even while casting the Star of Hope’s magic filled me with power.\nHowever, even so, I had no intention of changing my initial attitude. I wouldn’t passively drag out time; instead, I aimed for the moment to kill him.\nSimilarly, as the demon king looked up at Adilun, his gaze was filled with hatred. He seemed to be seething with anger at the fact that there was another significant enemy blocking him.\n“Uwaaah!”\nThat bastard let out a furious cry.\nIf time continued to drag on, they probably felt disadvantaged. Due to that, the king, who had been in a firm stance like a solid fortress, loosened his posture and gripped the massive axe again.\nContinuing, the demon king struck the ground. The earth trembled as his axe came fiercely towards me. However, I didn’t step back. Instead, I took a step forward, extending my fist toward the direction of his axe.\n- Quaaang!\nThanks to Adilun’s support magic, the impact transmitted through my arm was lessened, and the slight physical gap was narrowed, giving me the ability to take control of the flow of the battle.\nPerhaps the demon king also realized this fact, as he began to attack me with increasing urgency. The way he swung his axe became more impatient.\nMoments repeated.\nMy fist touched the king’s axe.\nThe axe collided with my fist.\nSparks flew simultaneously.\nAll these situations passed like separate moments, and within the continuous flow of those moments, I found openings in the king’s defenses.\nWith the momentum to completely kill him, I kept channeling my mana. The speed at which my fist struck his axe began to increase.\nThe moments kept continuing, forming a storm that pushed the king back. With each step on the ground, the earth trembled, and snowflakes fell, leaving marks on the ground.\nContinuing the battle, I made efforts to regain the sense of my past life. The desire to kill the enemy began to flow thickly within me.\nEven if the demon king knew and reacted, there would come a moment when he could not resist the storm.\n“Uwaaah!”\nHis resistance began. The strength of his axe, breaking through the storm of my fist, interrupted my flow.\nI struck the demon king’s axe with the back of my gauntlet, but due to an unimaginably intense impact, my defense momentarily broke.\nThis was dangerous. The sight of the demon king raising his axe again was imprinted in my retina.\nAt that moment, his axe lodged itself into my right shoulder. Then, the disgusting face of the demon came closer to me.\n- Quajik!\nA terrible pain began to flow throughout my body.\nBut I didn’t give in. Resisting the pain, I channeled my burning agony into anger, activating my body. Such injuries, I had experienced countless times in my past life. I couldn’t succumb to this trivial pain.\nI rotated the mana even more wildly, resisting the demon king’s axe. At that moment, my well-trained body finally began to shine.\nI endured the fierce blows of the axe without being cut, realizing that I could withstand his attacks. With this newfound confidence, I smashed the tough axe handle, made of the demon king’s bones, with my left hand.\n- Quajik!\nNow, the demon king’s axe was in a state where it couldn’t function properly.\nHowever, the demon king relentlessly grabbed the broken top part of the axe and exerted all his strength to cut off my arm. The pressure from his shoulders brought immense pain.\nBut I also exerted all my strength to resist him. I struck the demon king’s facial area with my left fist, infusing it with mana for added power.\n- Bang!\nUnlike the previous loud strike, this one was a solid blow. Instantly, the demon king’s body was sent flying far away.\nSeizing the opportunity, I pulled the axe out of my right shoulder, planted my feet on the ground again, and leaped towards the demon king. At that moment, my brain ignited, and the senses of my past life began to activate.\nThe surrounding scenery quickly passed by. I could vividly feel the sensation of each step I took and the snowflakes flying up.\nThe sound of the ground splitting echoed in my ears.\nAt the end of my sprint was the Demon King.\nI grabbed the demon king by the neck and drove him into the ground.\n- Quaaang!\nWith a violent roar, the demon king’s body was buried in the ground.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL:Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "Chapter 86: Demon King (3)\n[Adilun’s POV]\nUnder the Ice Wall, the demon king engaged in a fierce battle with Physis, while monsters slowly climbed over the Ice Wall.\nTo fight against the demon king alone. What on earth was he thinking? I was furious at Physis’ recklessness.\nEven to my eyes, the current demon king was an abnormally powerful being.\nEven if I completed Star Of Hope, I was not sure if I could handle him. It was a situation where I couldn’t guarantee anything, yet he faced such an opponent alone.\nMy mind kept getting distracted by surging worries, but I forced myself to gather my thoughts. Now was not the time to worry about Physis alone.\nBecause the soldiers fighting on the Ice Wall were on the verge of a direct threat.\nI pushed my magical abilities to the maximum. I chanted the Star Of Hope and followed it up with another offensive spell using the intentionally reserved power. While it might be a relatively simple spell, it should be enough to repel those climbing the wall.\nA fierce blast of flames swept through the monsters, their horrible cries reverberating around the wall. However, I averted my gaze from the spectacle and continued to complete the Star Of Hope.\nIn an instant, a loud noise erupted from below. Physis and the demon king stared at each other for a moment in a temporary ceasefire.\nNow, I felt I could offer him some help, so I cast an auxiliary spell to enhance his physical abilities.\nPerhaps due to the effect of the auxiliary spell, when they clashed again, it was evident that Physis had the upper hand. Feeling relieved, I continued my incantations for the Star Of Hope, and a line began to form in the air.\nI gathered scattered mana around me and gradually extended the line in the air. The line started to form a magical circle in the air. However, it still required a lot of time. It was a large-scale magic that I was implementing for the first time, so I had to be extremely cautious.\nAmidst all this, I didn’t forget to deal with the monsters flying over the wall. Despite that, the screams of the soldiers kept disturbing my ears.\nThere were just too many of them. Even with a regular army of 20,000 and 10,000 mercenaries, an unimaginable number of monsters overwhelmed us.\nI gritted my teeth, refusing to be swayed by useless thoughts, and desperately chanted spells to protect the surviving people.\nOriginally, even the simplest magic that didn’t require casting should have been usable. But while casting the Star Of Hope, I had no choice but to keep using casting spells because I couldn’t use non-casting magic. And the speed at which the monsters were accumulating was increasing.\nBut then...\nAt that moment...\nWith a sudden loud noise, a sound of something being torn was heard.\nInstantly, I felt ominous and looked down under the Ice Wall. The demon king’s ax was lodged in Physis’ right shoulder.\nA scream rose to my throat, but I couldn’t utter it. Breaking my concentration would stop the incantation of the Star Of Hope.\nIf the implementation of this magic stopped, we wouldn’t be able to withstand the monsters’ deluge. The soldiers and knights in front of me began desperately defending against the monsters pouring in.\nI forced myself to calm down. Physis told me to believe in him, so I had to trust him. What I needed to do now was to eradicate the monsters with the Star of Hope. So, I continued the incantation.\n- Kwaang!\nAt that moment, the wall shook continuously and began to break apart due to the attacks of the top-tier monsters directly hitting it. No matter how solid the wall was, it couldn’t withstand the constant impact.\nHowever, I didn’t take my eyes off the spell casting, even amidst the shaking wall, and I kept chanting the incantation. I had no room to use any other magic. The lines kept forming, and the line eventually formed a grand magic circle.\nEven after a grand magic circle was formed, the lines did not stop. The line that continued to be drawn began to create smaller magic circles sequentially under the large magic circle.\nEventually, a complex magic circle consisting of multiple layers was completed in the sky.\nHoping that he would not die... hoping for this battle to end quickly, I began the final process of the Star of Hope.\nThe Star of Hope, literally, embodies my hopes and materializes them.\nI weaved my current wishes into mana and put them into the small magic circle in front of me.\n- Hooong—\nAmidst the inappropriate sound of the gap, the shape emerged from the small magic circle and spread in the sky from the large magic circle.\nNow, all I had to do was wait. My hope started to swell as it passed through the magic circle.\nMy desired hope was purification.\nMonsters were born from humans’ negative emotions, and their power amplified with it.\nEven now, I could feel the monsters gradually getting stronger as they swallowed the fear of the soldiers.\nSo, I would eliminate the source of their power. I would purify their negative emotions and cleanse them completely.\nAs the mana carrying my hope passed through the final magic circle formed in the sky, just before landing in the midst of the monsters, I unintentionally looked below the Ice Wall to check on Physis’ safety.\nI was worried about what I saw earlier. But thankfully, he was still pinning the demon king to the ground with all his might.\nAt the same time, the Star of Hope fell into the midst of the monsters.\nThere was no sound as it hit the ground.\nWithout any noise, an intense light erupted.\nThe core of the monsters was engulfed in light, and the source of their power, humans’ negative emotions, began to be purified.\nThe light reached the Ice Wall. Both high-level and top-tier monsters were turned into ashes, scattered and blown away by the light.\nThe vast horde of monsters was obliterated, leaving only ashes. However, many still remained alive and moving. It was because the scale of the monsters was much larger compared to the range of the Star of Hope. There seemed to be more monsters than the soldiers stationed on the Ice Wall, so I didn’t relax.\nBut the monsters started to retreat quietly.\nThe monsters that were not within the range of the Star of Hope behind them seemed to be consumed by instinctive fear as they watched the current situation. The number of monsters backing away increased as fear spread. There were no longer any who tried to charge forward.\nAbove all, the only superior entity left to command them was now the demon king, but he was currently pinned to the ground by Physis.\nWithout a commanding entity, the monsters began to move instinctively. Their choice was to flee.\nThankfully, they were retreating.\nI slumped to the ground. Even though I had drawn mana from nature to use the magic, overwhelming exhaustion overwhelmed my entire body.\nOf course, the soldiers around me were thrilled and delighted that they managed to repel the attack.\nBut just as we felt relieved.\n“Kwaaargh!”\nThe roar of the demon king was heard.\n* * *\n[Physis’ POV]\nAs the monsters turned into ashes and scattered in the powerful light, I realized that Adilun’s magic had succeeded.\nThe demon king, who was stuck in the ground due to the aftermath, seemed to have suffered considerable injuries, as pieces resembling ashes started to fall from his damaged scales.\nIt was a sign that his body was collapsing.\nHowever, he wouldn’t die like this. My intuition told me so, and my eyes confirmed it.\nHe still had some power left and would make a final move. With a high-level monster like him, I had to be cautious even in their last moments; it was the same in my past life.\nIgnoring the pain in my shoulders, I refused to release my hand grabbing his neck. With one hand holding him up, I swung my fist, containing mana, at him.\n- Kwaang!\nAgain, a loud noise rang out, and his body was thrown far away. As he bounced away, he let out an angry roar at the fleeing monsters, abandoning himself.\nThe demon king, who had roared, regained his posture and stood up again. Pieces were falling from his steel-like skin, and fragments were also scattering from his arms and legs.\nHowever, he didn’t kneel. His whole body turned dark again, and the energy intensified as his disintegrated body surged.\nLikewise, I surrounded my body with mana in response. Adilun’s auxiliary magic was now dispersed, and the vitality that twisted my body was extinguished.\nHowever... it felt even better.\nThe final moments of eliminating the enemy, it was solely mine.\nBoth the demon king and I struck the ground at the same time. Even though he didn’t have an axe, when he saw my fistfight, he started imitating it.\nThough one could say it was merely an imitation, his mimicry of my martial arts seemed to be quite refined. However, his martial arts could not match mine. After all, it was the martial arts I had created. Naturally, in terms of proficiency, I was far superior.\nThe disadvantage lay in physical abilities, and the advantage was in the mastery of martial arts.\nOnce again, the moment we face each other again came.\n- Kwaang!\nThe sound of our fists and gauntlets colliding exploded. It wasn’t just a simple clash of fists. As his fist was blocked, his right leg swung fiercely, aiming for my head.\nWith my head bowed, I penetrated inside the demon king again, letting go of his fist. Avoiding his raining fists, I advanced towards him little by little.\nI realized that my surroundings were gradually slowing down, and the demon king’s movements were slowing as well. But my movements remained the same. It was a sensation I had felt in my past life. The feeling that proved I had reached a higher level.\nThe danger I felt when his axe was stuck on my shoulder stimulated my desire for survival and finally allowed me to regain the sense of my past life.\nI deftly avoided the slow-moving demon king’s fist and fiercely spun the mana coated on my fist. I felt the rough and wild mana embed itself on my left fist, far beyond what I had felt earlier.\nThere was no need for hesitation.\nI immediately swung my left fist toward the demon king’s upper body.\n- Kwaaang!\nWith a powerful explosion, the upper half of the demon king’s body was blown away.\nThe demon king who had pushed Adilun and Rodenov to the brink and dealt an irreparable blow to the north in the novel finally fell into my hands.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL:Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "Chapter 87: Previous life (2)\n[Physis’ POV]\nThe battle had come to an end, and we had successfully repelled the demon king and his horde, with minimal casualties.\nWhat stood out the most was that, according to the original story, this assault should have nearly annihilated the North and plunged Adilun into despair.\nThe main goal of the story was to portray Adilun rising above despair after a long struggle, but that goal was broken. There was no need to worry about sticking to the original storyline.\nTo me, the story didn’t have to adhere strictly to its original course. This place was not just a world within a novel; it was a world where the people I cherished lived and breathed.\nTherefore, it was crucial for Adilun not to fall into despair.\nMoreover, one could argue that it was fortunate for the story’s flow to deviate. If everything had followed the original plan, the calamity starting from the monster’s assault would have led to the invasion of Ortaire in the east, and events would have unfolded with the destruction of the North.\nThe terrible plague, originating from the shattered North, a combination of corpses and the vile energy of monsters, would have emerged. The story would have depicted how Vitala Church and Adilun united their strength to barely overcome the plague.\nIn truth, the most critical issue was the plague. It was more than a mere epidemic; many lives could have been lost due to this outbreak.\nIf the plague had spread to the central region, weakening Enadeim’s power, Ortaire would have been invaded by Eastern kingdoms.\nThough I didn’t fully comprehend the intricacies of the politics within the central region, at the very least, a new significant turn of events had emerged, one that preemptively blocked those disastrous occurrences.\nSo, I couldn’t help but feel delighted.\nEven with pain spreading through my shoulder, I could still smile. I was happy that many people had survived.\nI felt a sense of accomplishment that I had experienced in my previous life, once again welling up within me.\n‘Let’s go back.’\n‘I should return and share the joy with Adilun.’\nLeaving behind the corpse of the Demon King, I headed back to the Ice Wall.\nAt the Ice Wall, the soldiers’ cheers resounded. The triumphant cheers of soldiers brimming with joy over protecting the North... their excitement was contagious, even warming my heart.\nHowever, the moment I climbed the Ice Wall and faced Adilun, I sensed that my joyous emotions were being tinged with embarrassment.\n“...Adilun?”\nAdilun’s expression was twisted as if on the verge of tears. Only then did I realize that her gaze was fixed on my shoulder.\nI glanced at my right shoulder, brutally torn apart with bones almost exposed. It was a deep and potentially fatal wound that seemed to have happened during the battle.\nAlthough I was already accustomed to this level of pain, the problem was that Adilun had never seen such injuries on me before.\n...She seemed quite worried.\nShe rushed over to me and held me, starting to cast healing magic.\n“Are you okay? If you were going to get hurt like this... Why couldn’t you have just... fought on top of the wall? You could have been killed, seriously...”\nHer voice was filled with concern. But I was actually happy that she was scolding me out of worry.\nAs she cast healing magic while scolding me, I hugged her and said.\n“I’m sorry for getting hurt. I guess I wasn’t careful enough.”\n“Sorry? You... need to be scolded even more.”\n“Haha. I would appreciate it. But if I hadn’t come down, more soldiers would have been injured or killed. You saw it. The giant Ice Wall shook from a single attack he made.”\n“...Yes, still...”\nThe wound on my right shoulder gradually began to heal, but it hadn’t completely healed yet. When I had gone to apologize to her before, she had quickly healed me when I was almost frozen to death.\nBut now, the fact that she couldn’t heal such an injury meant that she had poured all her strength into the magic for protecting people.\nAdilun, who was trying to draw more mana out of the air, collapsed in her seat, probably because her strength was exhausted or because she felt relieved.\n“This is fine. You are very tired too.”\n“Still...”\n“It’s really okay. I will get better soon. You know how strong I am, right?”\n“...Yes.”\nReluctantly accepting her defeat, she lowered her head. I kneeled down and pulled her into my arms, saying, “You’ve worked hard, Adilun.”\n“So have you. Physis. It’s all because of you.”\n“What I did was nothing. If you hadn’t cast support magic, if you hadn’t used the Star of Hope... I wouldn’t have been able to defeat him.”\n“...Still. I think you would have made it through anyway. I think so.”\nIt was a typical response, but I accepted it with pleasure. As I gently ran my fingers through her disheveled hair, she spoke in a somewhat stern tone, which was how she usually responded to my touch.\n“And don’t think I’ll let you get away with it. You’ll get a good scolding later.”\nHer resolute tone made it seem like there was no room for argument.\n“...Alright. I’ll humbly accept it. I was boasting that I wouldn’t get hurt, but look, I did.”\nIn the end, I nodded.\nI didn’t know what kind of scolding I would receive, but it felt like a weak chill ran down my back.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nAlthough we managed to repel the monsters without too much damage, that didn’t mean there were no casualties.\nIt was a battle that could have resulted in more casualties if it hadn’t ended quickly, especially if we hadn’t swiftly taken down the Demon King.\nBut even so, we couldn’t simply put a value on people’s lives. The bodies of the deceased were given proper funerals inside the Ice Wall, and generous compensation was provided to their families.\nThe considerable amount of money that would have originally been used for military expenses was given to the families, and the soldiers and knights were also rewarded generously.\nMoreover, to lessen the burden on those who suffered the most in this war, the tax rate was reduced. After all, Rodenov’s finances were still thriving.\nAfter completing all these procedures, we immediately returned from the Ice Wall to Rodenov. We were warmly welcomed and arrived at the Duke’s residence.\nIt seemed like His Excellency Johannes, had heard about our achievements from Sir Aidan and was looking at us with admiration.\n“...You’ve been through a lot. You saved Rodenov. I heard Physis got injured?”\n“Ah, Adilun treated all my injuries, so I’m fine now. And... saving Rodenov was a team effort; it wasn’t just our effort alone.”\nAdilun and I replied that way.\n“I see. I understand. You must be tired, so eat something delicious and rest.”\nUpon receiving that response, he smiled gently and told us to take a break.\n“Understood.”\nWe soon headed to our respective rooms. Even though we were going to our separate rooms, there was a strange sense of regret. We used to share a room when we were at the Ice Wall.\n“Well then, rest well. Even though I have healed your injuries with magic, pushing yourself too hard might damage your muscles again.”\n“I will.”\nAdilun also seemed to feel the same regret as I did, as she glanced at me with a peculiar expression before returning to her room.\nAfter confirming that she had entered her room, I immediately returned to my room.\nDespite pretending to be okay, the battle with the Demon King had indeed left me quite exhausted.\nIt wasn’t just a matter of injuries; the fatigue from continuously facing formidable enemies and risking my life in battles still weighed heavily on me.\nWithout even having the chance to think about anything, I could only succumb to sleep.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n‘My head feels heavy. Where am I?’\nI opened my eyes and looked ahead. The landscape I thought I would never see again was right before my eyes.\nThe view of a devastated city and wrecked vehicles scattered around... Yes, to put it bluntly, it was a scene of a desolate city that had been swept away by a catastrophe.\nIn the center of that desolate landscape, there was a black dragon.\nAnd in front of me... once again, ‘it’ was there. A piece of my old personality. It faced me again, wrapped in a black mist. Taking on a female figure, it playfully asked me.\n[ Hello. Seeing me again? ]\n“Are You... a piece of my old personality?”\n[Yes. You haven’t forgotten.]\n“I can’t forget.”\n[Hahahaha. I guess so.]\nIts voice was somewhat scornful.\n“Why have you appeared again?”\n[ Well? Don’t you just think it’s a dream anyway?]\nAs it said, I should have just treated it as a dream and let it go, but a strange sense of unease welled up. I felt that there was something hidden, some truth to be revealed.\n[ Oh, should I congratulate you first? ]\n“...What?”\n[Because it looks like Adilun seems to be falling into your hands soon. You’ve put a lot of effort into getting her, right? Now you’re on the verge of getting married, right? Oh, congratulations. You, who had no relationships with any women in your past life, are getting married!]\nThe exaggerated tone was laced with vivid animosity.\nWhy was this piece, which claims to be my former personality, so twisted? And what does the sudden appearance of that dragon mean?\nQuestions flashed through my mind.\n[ You must be very curious. Why I appeared before you again, why you returned to the moment just before your death. ]\nFor some reason, it looked familiar; indeed, it was the place where I fought the black dragon just before I died.\n“Is this... the place where I died? Why are you showing me these scenes? And why do you harbor such hatred toward me? Even if you claim to be just a piece of my old personality, I can’t shake the feeling that you’re a separate entity.”\n[ Haha. Indeed, you do have such penetrating eyes to see through the essence, right? You see quite accurately. Well, there’s no need to go on with all the tedious explanations. ]\nThe figure exaggeratedly waved its hand and approached the black dragon. Finally, standing side by side with the black dragon, it looked at me and said:\n[ Now then... are you ready to accept the truth? I have a bad personality, and I find joy in biting someone at their happiest moment. ]\n“The truth?”\n[ Yes, the truth. Well then... even after witnessing this truth, can you still... not feel a sense of guilt? ]\nA twisted smile turned towards me. And... I couldn’t help but feel a certain foreboding.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL:Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "Chapter 88: Previous life (3)\n[Physis’ POV]\nThe fragment of my old personality said to me that it would show me some kind of truth.\n‘The truth. What truth could it be?’\nCould there be some truth that I was never meant to know?\nAs I pondered, the fragment started speaking beside the black dragon.\n[ Well then, where should I begin the story? Ah, right, that would be good.]\nAs it opened its mouth, the collapsed black dragon lifted its massive body.\n[ Yes, shouldn’t we witness the most shocking truth first? ]\n- Clap clap.\nThe fragment of my old personality suddenly started clapping.\nThen, I saw a person’s figure appear in front of the black dragon. A human facing the dragon in the ruins where no one else was present.\nThe black dragon roared and began to fight that person.\nOf course, that person was someone I knew very well. There was no doubt about it.\nThat person was my past self.\nThe more my past self clashed with the dragon, the more the surroundings collapsed and were destroyed.\nAs the battle continued, the black fog surrounding the fragment of my old personality slowly dispersed.\nAnd as the fog cleared, I couldn’t believe what I saw before my eyes.\nThe first thing that caught my eye was... the horns and hair that had turned black.\nThe horns, which should have originally glowed in a bluish-white color, were now a muddy black, and the beautiful hair that once reflected the night sky became contaminated and scattered into black strands.\nThen, the revealed face was partially covered with black scales, distorting the skin here and there. Between its torn dress, I could faintly see a black emblem protruding between the neck and chest.\nAnd above all... there was a cruel ridicule and disdain that Adilun could never have.\nThat fragment had taken on the appearance of Adilun. No, it hadn’t merely taken it on. I could directly see through to its essence. It was indeed Adilun.\n“... Adilun?”\nAt my question, that fragment nodded.\n[ Yes, I am... Adilun. In the novel you read, it is Adilun that has finally reached the end.]\n“You were definitely a fragment of my emotions…”\n‘Weren’t it?’\nAs I trailed off with the words I couldn’t quite swallow, Adilun, who had turned black, laughed at me.\n[ Did you believe that? How naive. ]\nA smirk lingered on the corner of her mouth.\n[ You must have always wondered. Why did the black dragon cross over to your world and kill people? ]\n“...”\nAs I couldn’t find the words to respond, Adilun began to decorate her story as if she were playing a joke, ith me fighting the black dragon from behind as an ornament.\n[ The answer is simple. It’s because I was disappointed in humans. Disgusting, despicable, and selfish beings who know nothing but themselves. ]\nThe black emblem emitted an eerie light, and soon, the surrounding atmosphere began to distort.\n“Why... like that.”\nI couldn’t help but blurt out, causing Adilun’s expression to contort.\n[ Why? How can you say such things? Ugh, my f*cking fiance. If you think about it, you are the cause of all this. If you had treated me well, maybe I wouldn’t have become the Adilun I am now. ]\nAdilun stared at me with all sorts of negative emotions. I couldn’t bear to face the embodiment of my sins.\n[ But you never acknowledged me for who I am. You called me a monster and undermined my worth as a being. I tried to endure the harshest words, planned to put up with it until the end, but the moment you insulted Rodenov and my parents, I couldn’t hold back anymore. ]\n“...”\n[ That’s when it all started. I killed you at that moment, and I crossed the point of no return. Wasn’t it written like that in the novel? After your death, I put in endless effort and grew. No, that’s not true. I was being consumed by the negative emotions that gripped me, just like how a monster is born. ]\n[After that, everything unfolded just like the novel. I struggled to remain myself, but as I witnessed the greed and desires of humans, I started to feel disappointed... and I was losing myself. Do you know why the plague spread? It was because they waged a war among themselves for the remnants of the collapsed demon king in the northern part. Moreover, seeing the corpses of my father and mother who died at that time, not even intact, I was completely consumed.]\n“...Stop it.”\nI tried to stop her, but all that returned was Adilun’s cold sneer.\n[ Stop? Why? ]\n[ And you have something misunderstood. You thought you were reincarnated as Physis, right? It’s exactly the opposite. ]\n“What?”\n[ You were originally Physis. Born without any trace of humanity, a primitive evil of humans, in a way. You died at my hands and were reincarnated in your world. The funny thing is, when I destroyed the continent I lived on and came to your world driven by some power, you, somehow, retained humanity. ]\n[ And that... disgusted me to no end. That’s why I wanted to destroy the world you were living in. ]\nAs Adilun’s words filled with hatred came to an end, the battle reached its climax. The fallen black dragon and my heavily injured form were visible. Then, as I killed the black dragon, all scenes seemed to freeze as if time had stopped.\n[ In that moment when we were killing each other, the time of the world began to turn back. We returned to the past world as if nothing had happened. Both you and I. ]\n“That... can’t be.”\n[ Do you know why I remain in your inner self? It’s because I filled the void left by the primitive evil that was in you. That’s why I remember everything and know everything. ]\nI couldn’t say anything. So, the past life I thought I had was actually my future self, and I had come back in time to the past? If I hadn’t changed, would Adilun have become like this?\nAbove all else... did I kill Adilun, who had become like that?\n“Ugh...!”\nMy memories resurfaced. Many memories came back to my mind. Every insult I had directed at Adilun overwhelmed me. Even the terrible words I said to Duke Johannes and Duchess Claudia.\nGuilt surged through my entire body.\n[ By the way, marriage? Between you and me? Haa. It’s not even funny.]\n[ I can guarantee one thing. You will never be happy. Even if you changed, I can guarantee that. ]\nThen, her golden eyes dangerously glimmered.\n[ I’ll make it that way. Do you want to know why I remain in your inner self? To devour you, just like I did before.]\nLaughter echoed in my ears. Gradually, a black tsunami rose behind her, filled with the faces of various beings, distorted by all kinds of desires—smiling, screaming, despairing, and raging.\nAnd... as the black tsunami surged to cover the world, it eventually engulfed me.\nVarious repulsive and negative emotions surged within me.\nThe accumulated evil intent of human history began to trample on my heart.\n* * *\n[Adilun’s POV]\nIt was a dark night.\nAs I opened my eyes, I realized that I had fallen asleep.\nOutside the window, the stars were shining.\nAh, we defeated the Demon King. It was all over now.\nRubbing my eyes to wake myself up, somehow, I wanted to see Physis. What was he doing now? Was he sleeping like me?\nCarefully, I headed towards Physis’ room. Unlike Ortaire, Physis’ room was a bit further away from mine.\nBut, something... an indescribable uneasiness started to creep in. The sharp uneasiness coursing through my skin was something I had never felt before.\nEven when Physis was injured by the Demon King, it wasn’t to this extent. Why was this intense uneasiness happening?\nUnknowingly, my steps quickened towards Physis’ room.\nAs I approached his room, I heard exhausted and tormented groans reaching my ears from inside.\nI opened the door and entered Physis’ room.\nThen, I saw Physis in distress, covered in cold sweat.\n“Physis?”\nI called him cautiously, but Physis didn’t show any signs of waking up. He just continued to suffer.\nI tried using magic to forcefully awaken his consciousness, but it had no effect at all.\n“Physis, Physis!”\nEven as I shook him, there was no change.\n“Wake up, Physis!”\n“...No... I’m Sorry... Sorry...”\nI saw him mumbling an apology to someone. Who could he be haunted by in his nightmares? ...Even after many try, he hadn’t regained his consciousness and only kept repeating apologies to someone.\nIn the end, all I could do was reassure him. As far as I knew, the only person he might apologize to... was me. The way he was burdened with that sense of debt was just like how he had shown when apologizing to me in the past.\n“It’s okay. Sob... I’m fine. So please, Physis, wake up... Please...”\nI gently stroked his distressed head, but all I could do was hope for him to wake up.\n* * *\n[Physis’ POV]\nThe sins of all kinds of people weighed me down. It felt like my vision was gradually getting dark and hazy.\nI knew that I couldn’t lose consciousness like this, so I made every effort to keep my sanity intact.\nHowever, even those efforts were gradually futile as a tsunami formed by the disgusting emotions of all humans and the sins I had accumulated came crashing down.\nI felt myself gradually becoming blurred. The freedom of my hands and feet was suppressed, and I began to see my fingertips turning black little by little.\nBut then, there was a voice that reached me.\nA voice filled with concern and undeniable affection... directed towards me.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL:Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

Please... ]\nThe warm voice of Adilun, different from the cold one I had just heard, echoed in my mind.\nIn an instant, the encroaching darkness caused by the tsunami consuming me started to ebb, and I began to revert to my original state.\n[ Damn it. Someone I hardly understand is now getting in the way...! ]\nWhat followed was the evil voice of the corrupted Adilun. As if reflecting her enraged emotions, the black tsunami began to surge forward, trying to swallow my whole body again.\nHowever, thanks to the brief moment of clarity given by Adilun, who observed from outside, I was able to regain my sanity.\nI realized If I were consumed here, I would undoubtedly lose myself, and if that happened, the current Adilun would never be happy.\nPushing against the tide, I now ignored the faces of those trapped inside, a stark contrast to my previous state of vulnerability.\nThe only things that had changed were my willpower and determination, and just that alone was enough to prevent that tsunami from harming me.\n[ ...Ugh ]\nThe corrupted Adilun glared at me with a seething expression. Still, I continued to approach her.\n[ Don’t come near me. ]\nThe tsunami eventually became a barrier, beginning to surround her. But even from within that barrier, her voice resonated.\n[ Why are you able to resist? Why aren’t your sins tearing you apart? Why! ]\nHer voice was filled with anger and sorrow.\n“Because I have someone waiting for me.”\n[ Soon, even that Adilun will see your true colors, realizing the monster you truly are! ]\n“That Adilun... she accepted me, even during the times I was a despicable person.”\n[ ... ]\nThe corrupted Adilun was at a loss for words. As if she tried to say something but couldn’t.\n[ Don’t be ridiculous. She doesn’t truly know you. She’ll surely regret it, just like me, for being involved with someone like you. ]\n“She must have already regretted it enough. She might have known, been afraid, wasn’t sure when I might change.”\n[ Then how did you win her over? ]\nAt her question, I simply smiled.\nI myself didn’t know the answer to that question. Why she forgave me? Why she accepted me? I could only think that perhaps she came to trust me by observing my actions.\n“I don’t really know either. I just... liked her. All I did was care for her. I acted for her as much as I liked her. and maybe my actions convinced her.”\n[ So, why... why didn’t you do that for me? ]\nHer voice was laced with sobs. She was resenting me at that moment. After all, I was the one who ruined her life. In a way, it was natural.\nAt that moment, I realized what I needed to do. I moved my feet once more, walking through the blackened space, heading toward the barrier surrounding her.\nThorns gradually formed from the barrier, attempting to prevent my approach.\nI didn’t resist. I let the thorns pierce my body with ease.\nAs they did, my skin shifted in hue, but my determination held. There were words I needed to convey.\n[I hate you. I despise everything about you...]\nAs those words filled the air, my darkened body began to change. My bones thickened, and I matured slightly in appearance.\nEven without a mirror, I recognized this change: I had become the version of myself from the future, the one who perished alongside the corrupted Adilun.\nIn the same appearance that the corrupted Adilun had shown me earlier, I walked toward her. I had accepted my sins, but I wasn’t consumed by them.\nBecause there was someone supporting me. Someone who gave me hope and was waiting for my return.\nSoon, I stood before the barrier. The corrupted Adilun didn’t launch any more attacks at me. She simply crouched within the barrier.\nThrough eyes that pierce to the essence, I saw the cowering, sorrowful figure of Adilun.\nI clenched my fist. An overwhelming sensation rushed through me, reminiscent of my peak power.\nMy power was concentrated. Perhaps the corrupted Adilun felt it too, for she exclaimed in shock.\n[What are you doing!?]\nShe, who had met her end with me that day, must know my strength. As a result, she began to fortify her barrier even more. The black barrier intensified, solidifying until it resembled a cocoon.\nBut I didn’t care and launched a powerful blow at the cocoon.\n-Quaang!\nA loud noise rang out, but the cocoon didn’t disintegrate. I continued to strike it. I needed to break this cocoon to face her and talk.\n[Stop it!]\nHer frantic shout echoed, but I didn’t stop.\nThe corrupted Adilun looked at me with a truly terrified expression. And why wouldn’t she? After all, I was the one who had killed her. But even knowing that, I didn’t stop hitting the cocoon.\nThis cocoon was formed from negative emotions, mirroring the darkness that consumed me and her.\nSo, I had to break it.\nGradually, cracks began to form. She no longer had the strength to resist, letting her hands fall.\n[ I don’t know what you’re trying to do... but do as you wish. ]\nWith her words, one final strike hit that cocoon, causing it to collapse and revealing her form once more.\nAnd at that moment, I was finally able to face her again.\n“Adilun.”\n[ …I don’t want to hear anything from you. So just go away. ]\nWith resentment, anger, hatred, and sorrow in her eyes, she gestured toward me.\nHowever...\n[ …Why? Why didn’t you?... ]\nI didn’t go away. The reason was simple.\nShe had told me that this realm was the very core of my soul. In the grand scheme, she wasn’t its master—I was. Unless I willed it, I wouldn’t depart.\nWith deliberate steps, I drew closer to her.\n* * *\n[Corrupted Adilun’s POV]\nPhysis made his way towards me.\nWhy? Why can’t I expel him from this space?\nWhile thinking about that, I realized the reason on my own.\nI had disclosed to him that this space mirrored his innermost self.\nDamn it.\nBlinded by my anger upon seeing him, I carelessly revealed information that I should’ve kept hidden. And that would likely mean my demise.\nSince I was leeching off his evil part, the moment he realized this space was his own heart, I became powerless.\nDefeated, I gave up and let go of my hand.\nThen, his hand extended toward me. I closed my eyes tightly. Even if I pretended to be strong, he was someone who had once killed me. He’d undoubtedly hurt me once more.\n‘I hate it. I’m scared. I hate him.’\nA turmoil of emotions gave birth to deep-seated resentment within me.\nWhy hadn’t he treated me like the present Adilun? The answer was clear. His true nature was evil.\nThe only reason he could shower the current Adilun with kindness was that, in the future, he learned empathy. I was well aware.\nYet, while my mind accepted it, my heart resisted. If only he had been compassionate from the start, I wouldn’t have endured such anguish.\nI wouldn’t have witnessed my parents being slaughtered by monsters, and wouldn’t have been driven to commit such heinous acts myself.\nI wouldn’t have had to face the darkest aspects of humanity.\nUltimately, knowing that I’d dissolve in this overwhelming bitterness, I would’ve preferred meeting my end sooner.\nWhy did the gods decide to send Physis and me back in time? Just why?\nAs my vision dimmed, an enigmatic child appeared. This child, who had shared my past tale with Physis, was certainly a being far beyond my comprehension.\nYes, God.\nWhy would such an entity inflict this torment upon me? Was it because of the countless lives I’d taken? Because I had wrought destruction not just on my own world but on other realms as well?\nLost in a storm of thoughts, I finally felt his touch. Yet, contrary to my expectations, there was no pain.\nInstead, I found myself enveloped in a comforting embrace.\nLifting my gaze, I met his eyes. The future him, looking at me with remorse.\nWith his black hair and eyes, he was the spitting image of the Physis I once knew. Yet the ravages of time had left their mark. He bore the exact look he had when he ended my life.\nWhy didn’t he kill me now? Why did he embrace me?\n[...Why?]\nTaken aback, I found my voice.\n“I’m sorry.”\nSorry? Why now?\nApologies, after all is said and done, seemed futile. Why utter them now? Was he mocking me till the very end?\nHowever, the genuine remorse reflected in his gaze gave me pause.\n“Don’t forgive me. Continue to resent and hate me. I have no intention of pathetically defending my wretched self. I’ve clearly committed unforgivable sins against you.”\nHe said, urging me not to forgive him—words he had once said to today’s Adilun.\nAnger surged within me.\n[Why... Why are you saying this now... When everything’s over! Everything’s ended, and I’ve nothing left, why!]\nThe family I held dear, the lands I cherished, and the last sliver of hope that allowed me to maintain my identity—everything had disintegrated into nothingness. Why was he choosing to tell me this now?\n“Going back in time doesn’t erase my sins. But... there are still remnants. The ones you loved.”\nI lifted my head. No. What I cherished has long been scattered in the shards of a time now forgotten. How could I ever forget? The way they perished, the way they disappeared.\n[No, those aren’t what I loved...]\n“No. Those are exactly what you loved. The scenery of Rodenov you adored, the people you loved... They’re all still here. You’ve seen them, alive and smiling again.”\nEmotion welled up inside me. No one remembered; no one was aware of the desolate future I had endured.\nYet, as much as I wanted to deny it, his words held truth. Through the lens of his rejuvenated sight, I recognized that all I held dear still thrived here.\nBefore all those tragedies unfolded. No, even after they occurred, a world brimming with more beautiful stories than the time I lived in.\nThe utopia I had longed for. Yet, I had no place in it.\n[There’s no place for me there. The current Adilun is the one who belongs. After losing everything to you, it’s time for me to disappear.]\n“You won’t disappear.”\nHe held me tightly in his arms, just as he had embraced the current Adilun.\n[Why are you suddenly acting like this toward me? You should just get rid of me.]\n“Because you are also Adilun. It was you who kindled the new hope within me, allowing me to relish the moments of joy with the current Adilun.”\nHis words silenced me. The moment of his transformation, his awakening to humanity.\nHe had been engrossed in my incomplete story, supporting my journey.\nHow ironic.\nThat was the only way I could perceive it. Everything about the situation was so ironic that I was left speechless.\n“That’s why you won’t disappear. You will always remain within me, if you wish. Of course... I’ll have to eliminate all those dangerous, negative aspects.”\nHe was willing to accept me. He seemed to contemplate making space for me in a corner of his heart so my existence wouldn’t vanish.\nBut I didn’t want to accept his offer.\n[No, I won’t accept it. I will never intend to forgive you.]\n“Don’t forgive me. I’m prepared for that. The current Adilun, and even me from back then, wouldn’t have forgiven either.”\n[Isn’t it ironic? If you had humanity from the start, could I have been happy?]\nBrushing aside his sentiments, I spoke my heart.\n“Perhaps you could have.”\n[Hahaha...]\nHow different he had become. This Physis, who had developed humanity, was a completely different person from the one I knew.\nIndeed, he was an entirely different being.\nSo, even if he were to be held accountable for his sins, it felt almost pointless.\nLiving like this felt pointless. Wouldn’t it be easier if I just disappeared?\nAs these thoughts consumed me, he intervened.\n“Don’t lose hope. The beginning has yet to come. The Demon King has been vanquished, and the North no longer stands on the brink of destruction. The plague’s rampage is halted. I... together, we thwarted it.”\n[…….]\nSuddenly he grabbed my hand.\n“I give you my word. I won’t allow the future you’ve endured to manifest. I’ll make certain you never find yourself on that path.”\n[Shouldn’t you be saying that to the current Adilun?]\n“I told you, you are also Adilun.”\n[No. That child and I are different entities. We’ve been through different events, at different times. Can you really say such beings are the same? So... this is right.]\nI could feel my existence gradually fading.\nIt was meaningless. No matter how much we talk, in the end, we were parallel lines.\nHe was living in the present, but I was a person trapped in the future, unable to see the present.\nSo, this was right.\nYet, still.\nHis vow to prevent the current Adilun from facing a future like mine... made me happy. Because at least I could tell that the current him genuinely cared for her.\nYes, this was good enough.\nGradually, my vision blurred. At that moment, he had an expression of sudden realization and said to me,\n“… Haa. So, that’s how it was. Yes, Adilun. Rest easy. Anyway… we’ll meet again.”\n[What?]\nWith those words, I was enveloped in darkness.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Hey, everyone!

      "content": "Chapter 90: Previous life (5)\n[Physis’ POV]\nUpon opening my eyes, the first sight that greeted me was Adilun. She had unknowingly fallen asleep while watching over me. I wanted to thank her right away, but I couldn’t bear to wake her up.\nIt struck me as odd that someone, who had been ardently calling out to me and waiting for my awakening, would fall asleep so abruptly. However, I soon pieced together the reason.\nI had witnessed the future Adilun gradually fading away, journeying to an unknown destination. It was more than a mere vanishing act; I could discern traces of her existence dissolving and dispersing...\nPerhaps, at this very moment, Adilun was facing her future self.\nI gently cradled her and headed to her room. The night had grown late. It was a serene nighttime landscape, devoid of any awake souls.\nHer peacefully sleeping face was incredibly charming. If it hadn’t been for her... I might have lost my mind, reverting back to my old temper, possibly losing the very humanity I had come to realize.\nI softly kissed her on the lips and settled into a chair, keeping watch. I patiently waited, hoping she would overcome her internal confrontation and, when all was said and done, that I’d be the first person she saw.\nIf until now it was my domain, from here on, it would be hers.\n* * *\n[Adilun’s POV]\nI opened my eyes. I was certain that I had been watching Physis in distress.\nWhere am I?\nI looked around, and my favorite scenery of Rodenov came into view.\nSpecifically, the bell tower of Caltix Castle caught my attention. I had occasionally frequented its pinnacle to relish the view of Rodenov.\nAnd there, I wasn’t alone. I saw the figure of a woman, surrounded by black mist.\n[ What... is this place? ]\nAs she opened her mouth, the swirling black mist around her began to settle, slowly unveiling her appearance.\nThe ends of her black hair were split and looked ragged. Her blackened, cracked horns were painful to see. Especially the black scales scattered across her body, they were distinctly different from the ones I had shed.\nAbove all... the dark stigma embedded above her chest.\nEvery morning, as I gazed into the mirror, the reflection staring back bore that very face...\nIt was me.\n“...Me?”\n[ How... How am I here...? ]\n“Who are you?”\nI was certain I had been taking care of distressed Physis. Yet, suddenly pulled into this space, I was now facing myself. A version of me that appeared to bear immense pain and fatigue.\nFor reasons I couldn’t quite explain, I addressed her in the softest of tones, as though comforting a distraught child.\nShe briefly met my gaze, sighed, and then murmured.\n[ Haa... So that’s how it is. ]\n“Yes?”\nIn response to my question, she looked up to the sky as if realizing something and then turned her gaze back to me. Her face was full of determination.\n[ I am you. Adilun Rodenov. To be precise... I am the future you. ]\n“The future me?”\nThat saddened figure was what I would become in the future?\n“Perhaps... Can you tell me what happened?”\n[ Ah, I forgot to explain one thing. To be precise, I am the version of you where Physis never fully repented. ]\n“...What?”\n[ In the timeline you are living in now, he has changed. But in the timeline I lived in, he hadn’t. ]\n“So, you became like this because of him?”\n[ It wasn’t all his fault. But yes, he was the reason I became like this. Let me explain in detail. ]\nI was surprised at her words, and perhaps it was because I had shown her kindness, she began to narrate her story with a slightly softened tone.\nShe said that I was currently in a period where time had turned back, and she was the original, the starting point version of me.\nUnable to overcome the hurt she had received from Physis, she ultimately killed him... making it impossible to mend the relationship with Ortaire.\nBearing that pain, she lost her parents to the Demon King and struggled to rebuild the North. She managed to drive out a plague, but her rage at human greed led her to full corruption.\nFrom there, she proceeded to annihilate the beings of her continent and moved on to another world, slaughtering its inhabitants.\nAnd then... she died with reincarnated Physis and woke up in the place tainted by his inner evil after time was reversed.\nIt was an unbelievable story, but I could accept it.\nSo that explained it...\nThat was why Physis had changed.\nA mixture of joy and sorrow welled up inside me. I was glad that because he had changed, I could avoid such a tragic fate. But the tragedy experienced by the first version of me made my heart heavy.\n[ So, you have nothing to worry about. Kind-hearted me... He has completely abandoned his inner evil. Moreover, since you’ve already dealt with the Demon King... You probably won’t have to experience what I did. ]\n“And what about you?”\nAt my question, the original me gave a bitter smile.\n[ I guess I’ll have to disappear now. There’s no place for me anywhere. Still... I’m glad that this time the things I loved didn’t shatter. ]\n“Isn’t there any way for you to continue living?”\n[ I don’t think so. There’s no place for me. Originally, I could exist where Physis’ evil resided, but even that’s not possible now. ]\nI couldn’t bear the thought of her simply vanishing. At the core, she was me, wasn’t she? To fade away after traversing such a sorrowful path... it seemed unjust.\nWatching her slowly dissipate with a look of relief, I impulsively grabbed her hand. A part of my hand darkened, probably because we were the same, she seemed to be affecting me.\n“So, what about merging with me?”\n[ Are you in your right mind? I represent pure negativity now. If you accept me, there’s no telling what could happen. It might even distort your relationship with Physis. ]\n“It’s okay. I’ll overcome it.”\n[ I don’t know where that confidence comes from, but I refuse. I don’t want to have regrets... not anymore. ]\n“Let’s live a bit more... together. There could be moments of joy ahead.”\n[ There might be. However, I’m too spent to cling to such uncertain prospects. ]\n“So, you’re thinking of just disappearing like this?”\n[ Yes. I’ve lived too long. I’ve withstood and endured the flow of time... to get here. At least I’m relieved that you guys can be happy. ]\nI couldn’t say anything. Looking at her exhausted form, I could sense the immense pain and despair she had lived through.\nHowever, a sudden thought struck me. If I let her disappear like this, I would regret it for the rest of my life.\nSo, I impulsively grabbed her hand and pulled her into an embrace. It was an instinctual movement. As our contact deepened, I felt a part of me becoming darker... Perhaps doing this might be the solution.\nAnd that instinct was right.\n[ You...! Are you mad? ]\n“I can overcome it- the storm of negative emotions, the tidal waves. So... Let’s endure it, side by side.”\nSeeing my stubborn face, she shut her mouth.\n[ Whether it’s you or Physis... you both are foolish. ]\n“Maybe. Our likenesses might be why we’re so drawn to one another.”\n[ ...If you accept me, I might be absorbed by you. And we will become one. The memories and life I’ve lived will weigh heavily on you. You will be yourself but also me. The process will be excruciatingly painful. You might even lose yourself. Still... is that okay? ]\nWithout hesitation, I nodded. I was well aware of the impending pain and trials.\nBut... in doing so, couldn’t she and I become a complete whole? Together, loving the same person, looking forward to the future? Not a painful future, but hoping for a happy one.\nIt was a risky gamble. The chances of success were probably slim.\nBut I had no intention of backing down. Physis would probably hope for the same.\n“It’s okay. We can overcome it. He will guide you and me, just as I did.”\n[ ...Alright. Remember, you allowed this. ]\nWith that, my body began to darken, and once again, the scales I had despised started to form.\nAnd a wave of negative emotions, coupled with memories filled with despair, washed over me.\nI let the tidal wave sweep me away, dreaming of hope and certain that if I falter, he would guide me.\nSurely, he will.\n* * *\n[Physis’ POV]\nChanges began in the sleeping body of Adilun. Her peacefully resting form shuddered, and scales appeared and receded on her skin. Parts of her arms, legs, and body turned dark and then reverted back to their original color.\n“Uh...”\nPained groans escaped her lips.\nI quickly approached her. She must have reunited with the future Adilun. And given her kind nature, she must have accepted her.\nI held her hand, just like she did, and talked to her endlessly.\n“Adilun, it’s okay. You’ll be alright. You can come back. Don’t be defeated by those negative thoughts. Don’t be consumed by painful memories. Think of the future we will share.”\nWhispering softly, I painted a picture of our shared future, conveying it to her.\nHer expression began to soften. Though she still seemed to be in pain, it was clear she was gradually overcoming it.\nI continued to speak to her. I suggested that once this was over, we should travel. I told her of the vast oceans in the warm southern region and how through them, we might even be able to venture to other continents.\nLet’s enjoy and experience all the wonderful things out there.\nThen, gradually, Adilun’s painful moans began to fade. And her body began to stabilize.\nOn her skin, just like the future Adilun, scales began to form. They appeared endearingly on her chin, cheeks, arms, and legs. Unlike before, when they covered her whole body, now they only seemed to enhance her beauty, making her look somewhat more charming.\nSoon, glimmering white scales gracefully appeared over her slightly exposed nightgown.\nWhen the transformation was complete, her eyes snapped open.\n“…Physis?”\n“Adilun.”\n“I’ve accepted it all. I have become the future Adilun, and the future Adilun has become me. Our personalities merged, her memories, my memories, and our emotions have all combined.”\n“I know.”\n“Are you... okay with it? I may not be exactly the person you fall in love with.”\n“No matter who you become... It’s okay because I’m determined to love you.”\n“…Yes.”\n“I’m so relieved you’re back, Adilun.”\n“Thank you for constantly calling out to me. Because of that, I could overcome it.”\n“I’m sorry that’s all I could do, given how painful it must have been.”\n“No, it’s okay. If it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t have been able to overcome it.”\n“Do you still resent me?”\n“No. Perhaps we have reached this point because of everything we went through. We hated and grieved each other, but perhaps that’s why we found each other again.”\n“That might be true.”\n“That’s why it’s okay. The me who loved you, the me who felt resentful and fell into corruption, and the current me – we’re all the same person. Just like how you, devoid of humanity, the future you who sacrificed your life for others, and the current you, are all the same person. So... it’s okay.”\n“Yes.”\n“So now, I suppose there’s one essential thing left to say.”\n“What is it?”\n“I love you, Physis.”\n“…I love you too, Adilun.”\nWe held each other, with nothing more to say, feeling the warmth of each other’s embrace.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "Chapter 91: Travel and crossing the line (1)\n[Physis’ POV]\nThat day, we fell asleep in each other’s arms, exhausted, without forming any special bond.\nPerhaps our greatest problem was the lack of energy. Just confronting the future Adilun and realizing the truth had drained much of our strength.\nEven though the moment I had ardently wished for had come, we just fall asleep.\nThere would be many opportunities, so there was no need to rush.\nMaybe it was time for a trip. Since I had decided to travel south with Adilun, this might be a good chance.\nThe next morning, as soon as I woke up, I spoke to Adilun.\n“Adilun.”\n“Hmm?”\n“Do you remember the promise we made in Ortaire?”\n“The honeymoon promise, about going to the sea?”\n“Yes.”\n“Why all of a sudden? We still have some time until the wedding.”\n“I was just thinking, instead of a honeymoon, how about we take a trip just the two of us.”\nAt my words, Adilun smiled slyly.\n“Hehe, I’d love that. I’ve actually always wanted to travel just with you, without anyone else.”\n“Then when would you like to go?”\n“The sooner the better. Now that we’re on the topic, shall we prepare and leave tomorrow?”\n“Tomorrow?”\n“Yes.”\n“Alright, then.”\n“We’ll see the sea... and many amazing things. And...”\nFor a moment, Adilun blushed and then continued,\n“We could... take the step we couldn’t before?”\nHer shy proposal was so cute. Seeing her embarrassed about a topic that had once tempted me so much made me want to hug her right away.\n“...Okay.”\n“But I think my parents might be surprised to see that I have scales again...”\n“Can you tell me why the scales returned?”\n“It’s a dragon trait. Didn’t I ever say that the scale is like a magical organ?”\n“Yes.”\n“These scales are because of the new awakening.”\n“Because of new awakening?”\n“Yes. You can think of these scales as magic organs which temporally store and harness the mana in the process of awakening.”\n“I see...”\n“By any chance? Does it gross you out?”\n“What? No way. It just feels mysterious.”\n“I’m relieved. I thought you might dislike it...”\n“Didn’t I tell you? I liked you even when you were covered in scales.”\n“...Yes.”\nAdilun’s face turned a deep shade of red.\nI couldn’t resist any longer.\nI grabbed her face. For a moment, I felt the smooth sensation from the tiny scales on her cheek. The feel of her soft cheeks and the scales between felt mysterious. Somehow, it made me feel like I had fallen for a mysterious being.\n“Ah?”\nI pressed my lips against Adilun’s, who was taken aback by my sudden approach.\n“Mmm...”\nA tingling sensation raced from the tip of my tongue to my brain. After defeating the Demon King, and being unable to engage in intimate moments for quite some time... I was starved.\nPerhaps Adilun felt the same, her initial surprise melting into the kiss. Only after satiating our mutual yearning did we draw apart.\n“Haah. Let’s get ready, quickly.”\nAdilun said abruptly with a flustered expression. I nodded in agreement. Whether it was a trip or anything else, I wanted to go somewhere where it was just the two of us... and make love to her.\nI wanted to cross the line we hadn’t crossed before.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nWe quickly finished our preparations. Having defeated the Demon King and completing the subsequent tasks, we discreetly spoke to Duke Johannes and Lady Claudia during breakfast.\n“Um, Your Excellency.”\n“Yes? What is it?”\n“Now that most of our major tasks are over, Adilun and I were hoping to take a trip... Would that be alright?”\n“A trip?”\n“Yes. We made a promise in Ortaire to someday travel to the sea. With the Demon King matter settled and Adilun’s heirship lessons temporarily halted, it seems like the perfect time...”\n“Go ahead. There isn’t anything pressing for Adilun in the near future... and there’s no issue with just a few days of travel. But do inform me about one thing.”\n“What might that be?”\n“When do you plan to get married? I’d appreciate a definite date.”\n“Ah, well...”\nBefore I could answer, Adilun, who had been listening quietly, spoke up.\n“We’re thinking of preparing for the wedding as soon as we return.”\n“...Is that so?”\n“Yes. There’s no point in delaying it further.”\n“You’ve made a wise decision. In any case, there shouldn’t be any issues, so go and enjoy.”\n“Thank you, Father.”\n“It’s nothing. It’s the least I can offer, especially after the challenges you both faced during the northern monster invasion.”\n“Ah, Adilun.”\nSuddenly, the Duchess Claudia spoke.\n“Yes, mother?”\n“I’ll be looking forward to some good news.”\nIn an instant, a small cough escaped me. It seemed the two were aware of the nature of our trip. Given the frequent acts of affection we’ve shared in the castle, they probably knew it was about time.\n“...Yes.”\nAdilun, with her cheeks painted a shade of rose, quickly finished her meal, and together, we practically fled the scene.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nJust like that, the preparations for the journey began. In fact, there wasn’t much to prepare. All we needed were a few sets of clothes to wear and some money for expenses.\nMoreover, both of us weren’t lacking in strength, so even if we faced any unexpected circumstances, we could easily overcome them. Additionally, in terms of our status, there weren’t many people above us, so the preparation for the trip concluded quite smoothly.\n“We’re finally done. Hehe.”\nAdilun smiled slyly and said.\n“Yes. I think finishing quickly was partly thanks to the space magic.”\n“I’ve recently gained insight into it. I’m glad it was helpful.”\nEver since merging with her future self, Adilun had acquired a proficiency in space magic. It simplified packing, letting her just stow belongings in a magically created pocket dimension.\nLooking at Adilun, who was smiling innocently at me, I felt closer to her than before. Perhaps because we started speaking informally.\n“You know, hearing you talk informally feels strange and new.”\n“Hm? Why? Don’t you like it? Should I go back to being formal? If you don’t like it, I will.”\nAdilun carefully gauged my reaction. I gave a slight smile and shook my head.\n“No. I like the informality. It feels more intimate. After all, there’s only a one-year age difference between us.”\n“Hehe, really? To be honest, after merging with my future self, I started speaking informally without even realizing it. I didn’t plan on it initially, but now it feels more natural.”\n“It’s probably influenced by the longer life your future self has lived. After all, you are the same person. You’re bound to have the same characteristics. It feels even better, actually.”\n“Really?”\n“More than anything, I never knew you had such a playful personality. I think the merging might have released some suppressed tendencies from within you. Just like... the time you seduced me. I felt you were quite bold then.”\nAs I slightly blushed and spoke, Adilun’s face also reddened, perhaps recalling that moment.\n“It... it does seem that way. Ever since we merged, I’ve begun to feel a strange sense of liberation…”\n“Even so, I’d appreciate it if you showed this side of yourself only in front of me. I’d prefer you to remain composed around others.”\n“Ahaha, what’s this? Are you perhaps jealous?”\n“Maybe. Most people would be smitten by you. Remember during the last gathering, there were so many pests trying to approach you?”\n“Yes, but don’t worry. I have no intention of showing this side to anyone but you.”\n“Good. Now that our bags are packed, shall we set off?”\n“Yes. Let’s. Honestly... I can’t hold back any longer.”\nHer words carried an undeniable heat. Likewise, a passionate desire was evident in her eyes. Who could see that and not have their heart race?\nObserving my own mirrored desire in her gaze, an overwhelming urge consumed me. Now, all barriers have crumbled, and only the act of becoming one remained.\n“I feel the same way. Honestly, I wonder if you realize how much I’ve held back since the last time.”\n“I know. Back then, you were frustrated for not being able to have me.”\n“This time, I truly won’t be able to resist.”\n“Hehe, I knew you’d say that, so I’ve been building up my stamina.”\n“Even so, it won’t be enough. I won’t stop, even if you ask me to.”\nIn response to my whispered words, Adilun looked at me with slightly moistened eyes, as if she was growing even more excited.\n“…Haaa. I wish you’d be even more like that.”\nWith her quickened breath, she whispered in my ear, and my excitement began to escalate. I wanted to tear off her clothes and take her right then and there... but just a few more hours of patience would suffice.\nStill, the foremost concern was embarking on our trip. I took a moment to compose myself and laid out our exact plans to her.\n“First off, we need to decide on our destination. The place with the sea is the southern in Magnolia. Fortunately, it’s where the teleportation gate is located. We can list our purpose of visit as tourism, and we’ll find a decent place to stay once we arrive. Did you bring the items to prove our identities?”\n“I’ve got everything.”\nBut the suppressed excitement wasn’t something that could easily be concealed. Both for her and me. Maybe going straight to the beach as soon as we arrive might be... a bit too ambitious. Anyway, we had already informed Duke Johannes about our travel dates... All that remained was to make the most of it.\nWith hearts full of anticipation, both of us moved toward the teleportation gate.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "Chapter 92: Travel and crossing the line (2)\n[Physis’ POV]\nStepping onto the teleportation gate, we were immediately greeted by a refreshing breeze, distinct from the chilly atmosphere of Rodenov.\nUpon arriving at the Magnolia, we promptly told the knight in charge of the teleportation gate that we were simply travelers. And after briefly greeting the Marquis and Marquess of Magnolia, we quickly took our leave.\nThere was no point in staying there unnecessarily. We didn’t come to seek hospitality from the Magnolia family but to relish our journey.\n“It’s cool here. But feels a bit different from Rodenov.”\nI heard Adilun’s excited voice right next to me.\n“Yes.”\nComing out of the Marquis mansion, what lay before us was a brilliant white city.\nIt emitted a unique vitality characteristic of coastal cities, distinct from Enadeim, and the scent of the sea began to waft toward us.\n“Hmm...?”\n“What is it?”\n“I smell something.”\n“A smell?”\n“Yes. How do I describe it...?”\n“Oh.”\nIt seemed Adilun was experiencing the scent of the sea for the first time, which was understandable. Having spent most of her time in the North and only venturing to inland cities, she probably hadn’t visited a coastal city like Magnolia before.\n“That’s the smell of the sea.”\n“The smell of the sea?”\n“Yes. A fragrance you can only catch from the sea.”\n“It feels so new.”\nSeeing Adilun smiling at the novelty of the place, I found my mood lifting in response.\n“Where should we go now?”\n“Anywhere. It’s my first time here as well.”\n“Have you never been to the sea before?”\n“Not in this timeline, but I often visited the coast in my previous world before time reverted.”\n“Oh... With someone?”\n“No, fighting monsters.”\n“Oh.”\nAdilun’s expression momentarily froze.\n“It’s alright. I won without any damage.”\n“Hehe, I was momentarily caught off guard.”\n“It’s fine. It happens. Anyway, let’s move.”\nWe ambled through the shimmering white city, taking in its unique charm. The atmosphere was distinctly different from Rodenov. It was rather static, and was not the calm vitality that people display cautiously under their eyes, but watching everyone walk down an unfamiliar street, releasing their bodies into the cool sea air, showing all their vitality, It was as if we had stepped into another world.\n“I feel invigorated. It’s definitely different from Rodenov... more open.”\nIt seemed Adilun felt the same way.\n“That’s to be expected. People’s ways of life change according to their environment. That’s why I liked to travel. Not just to see the sea... but to feel the novelty of seeing how people live within it.”\n“Yes, I think so too.”\nIn the street, there were many vendors selling seafood with their skins tanned by the sun.\nAlthough the fishy smell might be somewhat off-putting to some, Adilun never lost her smile as she enjoyed those things as well during her stroll.\nPerhaps because we were dressed lighter for the warm region, we felt the gaze of many people on us.\nEspecially, the horns on Adilun’s head drew the attention of many, with curious expressions. Just as we found them intriguing, they too seemed fascinated by us.\nFrom a distance, the innocent voice of a child reached our ears.\n“Mom! That sister has horns on her head! And scales on her cheeks! But she’s so pretty!”\nWith that voice, we started feeling even more eyes on us. However, we kept exploring without any hesitation.\nIf we were looking around, we could hear an older woman commenting on our unique appearances, and someone cautiously asking if Adilun might be a descendant of the legendary sea dragon.\nWhen we mentioned the dragon lineage from the northern lands, some were so startled they even tried to bow in reverence.\nRumor had it, due to superstitions among sailors, they prayed to the sea dragon for a safe journey on the water that day, and hope that no storm will strike. In their eyes, with horns on her head and subtle scales on parts of her skin, Adilun might seem like a manifestation of the sea dragon.\nEven after clarifying that she wasn’t such a grand entity, people prayed to her for bountiful catches or to discover treasures.\n“It feels strange, being treated not just as an anomaly, but almost as a divine being. I wasn’t treated like this in Rodenov.”\n“Haha, is that so? I hope you don’t find it unpleasant?”\n“No, it’s quite fascinating. Meeting new people feels like this. I think it was wise not to reveal our noble status.”\n“What would you have done if something had gone wrong?”\n“Hehe. Do you think we’re the kind to face such issues?”\n“If you put it that way, probably not. So, shall we... find an inn?”\n“First, let’s find a place to stay, and then explore the sea. I want to try something new too.”\n“Sure.”\nWe went around asking people about a place to stay with a neat appearance.\nAmong them, one of the villagers who held Adiluun sacred told us that there was an inn where high-ranking people who came to rest by the sea often stayed, and we walked straight to that inn.\nSoon after, a large inn of considerable size began to appear. Indeed, it did seem like an inn where aristocrats often stayed.\nThe exterior, resembling a mansion, looked very clean, and without hesitation, we entered.\n“Welcome. We’re pleased to have you at the Magnolia Inn.”\nUpon entering the building, the neat interior greeted us. The employee caught sight of Adilun and me and asked cautiously about our identity with a slightly surprised look. Adilun revealed that she was a successor to Rodenov.\nThe employee’s eyes widened, and he immediately offered us the best room. During this process, there was a minor hiccup where the manager insisted on treating us well.\nNormally, one would have to make a reservation to get the best room, but it seemed the Marquis of Magnolia, whom we met in the morning, had reserved a room for us just in case.\nThere was a command to treat us with utmost sincerity if we were to come. I thought we might need to repay the Marquis of Magnolia later.\nAnyway, we firmly told them not to fuss over us too much and not to come into our room if possible. We instructed them to leave the meals that the inn provided outside our door at the appropriate times.\nFortunately, they seemed relieved, perhaps feeling there was no need for unnecessary concerns, nodding in understanding.\nGiven it was a city with a thriving tourism industry, the inn was very pleasant and spacious.\nA large bed and the soft blankets covering it caught our eyes. Looking out from the terrace, the vast expanse of the sea filled our view. It seemed the building was designed with all this in mind.\nI heard that the Marquis of Magnolia started this inn business because he wanted to earn money from tourism. It was known as a vacation spot for nobles.\nWe quickly unpacked our belongings in the inn room. After organizing our change of clothes, we changed into lighter attire.\n“What do you think?”\nAdilun, who changed into a sky-blue dress, twirled in front of me. Even though she looks like a tomboy, somehow she was so beautiful that I couldn’t take my eyes off her and just admired her.\n“You’re stunning.”\n“Thank you.”\nWith a playful smile in her eyes, Adilun and I headed toward the beach.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nStepping out of the inn, we immediately headed to the beach. The sight of several rocky islands came into view, and the vast expanse of the sea unfolded before our eyes.\n“Wow...”\nAdilun’s eyes widened, and she smiled innocently, as if a child beholding the world’s most wondrous sight. The boundless azure sky above and the sea stretching to the horizon below. A refreshing shade of blue filled our vision.\nThe view was overwhelmingly breathtaking.\n“It’s incredible. So, this is the sea.”\n“Do you like it?”\n“Yes!”\n“Then, let’s get closer. I think it’ll be nice to walk on the sandy beach.”\nNodding in agreement, she took my hand and we strolled along the sandy shore.\nAs we enjoyed the soft touch of the sand and continued gazing at the sea, it was only natural for our playful side to emerge.\n“Huh? What’s that look for?”\n“Don’t you want to dive into the sea?”\n“I do, but... won’t our clothes get all wet?”\n“We can always dry them with magic.”\n“Hehe, true that.”\n“Shall we then?”\n“Huh? Wait! Ahhh!”\nSuddenly, I scooped Adilun up and tossed her into the sea. With a loud splash, she plunged straight in.\n“Wha- Huh!”\nAdilun started glaring at me for suddenly throwing her in. Did I go too far? But just as I began to worry, she suddenly burst out laughing while looking at me. It was evident that she was thoroughly enjoying the experience itself.\n“Ahahaha!”\nWatching her like this, I realized that choosing the sea as our destination was indeed the best decision.\nLost in that thought,\nSuddenly, I felt Adilun’s mana wrapping around me.\nCould it be?\nI didn’t resist. Just as Adilun wished... I was hurled into the sea just like her.\n“Cough cough cough!”\nI swept my hair back, spitting out the mouthful of water. And there she was, softly laughing, pushing her wet hair back. She looked irresistibly charming.\nHer white dress clung to her, slightly revealing what lay beneath. It was a good thing we were in a secluded area, away from prying eyes.\n“Adilun, your dress is quite see-through?”\n“Oh, oops!”\nRealizing the truth, Adilun quickly wrapped herself in an opaque bubble formed by magic, drying her clothes. In no time, the signs of her being drenched vanished, and she floated on top of the bubble, looking down at me.\n“Hehe, who started this mischief?”\n“Looks like I got a taste of my own medicine.”\n“Ahahaha.”\nWe spent a bit more time in the sea before returning to the inn with light snacks. And the one who suggested we head back to the inn was me.\nAfter witnessing her drenched state, it became increasingly hard for me to hold back.\nWhether Adilun caught on to my intentions or not, even with the sun still high in the sky, she blushed deeply, nodding in agreement.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read up to 10 chapters ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "Adilun subtly lifted her head to look at Physis. The faint blush on her face and the budding anticipation that colored her features softly reached out to him.\nTime seemed to crawl slowly. It felt as if a time barrier had been set, even though none was actually in place… Strangely, the road to the inn felt unusually long.\nPerhaps it was because they were both anticipating something. Adilun, stealing sidelong glances at Physis, hurried her pace while trying to appear nonchalant.\nTime, reluctant though it may have been, eventually moved on. Before they knew it, the pair found themselves back in front of the inn.\n“…Shall we go?”\n“…Yes.”\nThough they’d ‘seen’ each other before, crossing this line would be a first for both of them, making them both nervous. Adilun then made up her mind.\nNow was the time to reveal everything she had diligently prepared. Last time, she was so happy with the blissful time she had spent with Physis.\nThis time would be even better, if not equally so. She had even lied about building up stamina for fighting the demon king, so Physis wouldn’t know how much she had been looking forward to this day.\nPhysis would likely be quite surprised. Without knowing, Adilun felt her cheeks flush; all sorts of audacious and embarrassing fantasies unfolded in her mind.\nPhysis was the same. How long had he waited for this day since their last intimate night? In order to endure so far, he had to muster almost superhuman restraint.\nAfter going through so much, it was clear where both their hearts stood; the only thing left was to break down the remaining walls between them.\nJust one more tiny step… and everything they had been wanting would unfold before them.\nYet they couldn’t help but feel a little uneasy. How much restraint had they exercised until now? Holding back might be nearly impossible.\nIf Adilun gives permission, he might be uncontrollably rough with her. He was worried this might hurt her.\nPhysis shook his head slightly. It would be fine. Wasn’t he confident about his patience? Especially as this would be their first time; they would need to be careful about each other’s comfort.\nHow painful it was for women for their first time… …didn’t it appear in the many media in his previous life, no, the future-self life?\nSo, as this was Adilun’s first time, he should be more careful than anything else. He was also willing to stop if Adilun felt the pain severe.\nSurrounded by such thoughts, climbing up the steps to their room seemed particularly slow. But they weren’t rushing; they had plenty of time.\nAdilun might even cast a time barrier spell again. Considering that, their time together would be even longer. Physis remembered the resolve he had last time: to not leave her alone.\nIf Adilun doesn’t feel too much pain and instead is keen, he might just continue until both collapses from exhaustion.\nFinally, both reached the front of their room. Adilun looked at Physis, and Physis looked at Adilun. Their mutual shyness seemed funny for some reason, and they ended up laughing.\n“Pufff!”\n“Hahaha!”\n“Shall we go in?”\n“Ah, wait a moment, Physis. There’s something I want to prepare.”\n“Prepare? What are you preparing?”\n“You’ll know when you see it. So… just wait for a little while. I’ll call you when I’m ready.”\n“Alright.”\nPhysis eagerly decided to wait. He suddenly thought back to the last time Adilun had freed his desires. The faint aroma of roses that lingered in the air, the negligee that subtly revealed her skin. How had he felt seeing that? Hadn’t he run at her like a madman?\nPerhaps… she would prepare in the same way this time too. Physis couldn’t help but think so, increasingly losing his rationality to excitement. How to start, what would Adilun do this time?\nIt seemed she too was looking forward to their time together, especially after what she had said last time.\n‘Devour me.’\nYes. He would devour her. Physis couldn’t think otherwise. His vision started to blur. Emotion began to dominate his reasoning. The primal instincts he had been suppressing with almost superhuman patience were gradually straining at the leash, wanting to burst forth.\n* * *\nEntering the room, Adilun began to use her mana. She too started to focus more on emotions than reason. How long she had waited for this day, how much she had prepared. Whenever she had time, she even made magical potions, she even spent her days filled with all sorts of lascivious thoughts and fantasies.\nEven after merging with her future self, her love for him remained unchanged; if anything, she now wanted to know him more and become one with him as soon as possible.\nWhat needed to be done was simple. Prepare, just like last time.\nThe room’s structure started to distort, becoming larger. There was no noise; her magical capabilities were now akin to that of a dragon. The already luxurious bed was veiled with a mysterious curtain, and the room began to fill with a dreamlike atmosphere.\nMoreover, time started to slow down. A time barrier had been deployed.\nAs Adilun took each step toward the bed, her clothing started to transform into an audacious outfit designed to cloud Physis’ rationality.\nA thin negligee, so transparent it could be considered brazen, without a single frill or decoration, made solely to seduce.\nIt was even bolder than the negligee she had worn previously, and Adilun felt her face flush involuntarily. She shook off the thought.\nRight now, she wanted to completely extract Physis’ rationality by any means necessary. She wanted to see him charge at her like a beast.\nNext, Adilun took a magic potion from her pocket dimension and opened the lid.\n-Pop\nAs the lid of the potion opened, a faint aroma of flowers started to fill the room. It was an elixir designed to cloud judgment, boost stamina, and enhance libido.\nThis elixir was based on a formula found in the secret archives of Rodenov’s library, purportedly crafted to rekindle the romance between the lady of Rodenov and her husband, whose relationship had grown cold.\nAs she smelled the fragrance, Adilun felt her face gradually heat up. She had made a decision today; she would blend various magical elements together but would avoid casting any direct magic on him or herself.\nThe idea was not to use any magic to amplify sensations, but only to utilize additional devices to enhance the atmosphere.\nAfter all, she wanted to experience their first time in its purest form.\nUsing an elixir might also be questionable, but since it was their first time and her heart was somewhat uneasy, she rationalized that it was forgivable.\nFinally, Adilun arrived at the bed. Unbeknownst to herself, her face was flushed with many fantasies.\nYet, with the thought of thoroughly seducing Physis before their first physical relationship, she took great effort to calm her blushing face and regained her composure. How much time had passed?\nAs Physis’ patience reached its limits outside the room, Adilun sent him a telepathic message.\n[…Come in.]\nHer tone was somewhat, no, significantly sensual. Deliberately seductive, a voice deeper and more enchanting than usual reached Physis’ mind.\nUnable to restrain himself any longer, Physis opened the door.\nThe room was different from before; a bit darker, dreamy, with a swirling fragrance of flowers. What scent was this? It was distinct from the rose scent they had last time, but the more he smelled it, the more it seemed to blur his rationality.\nIndeed, she had been deliberate in her seduction.\nAs his eyes fell upon the distant bed, curtains drawn, he could almost imagine Adilun waiting for him with a provocative expression. Physis felt his lower body gradually swelling with tension.\nNot much time remained now.\nWith each step, the scent that reached his nose grew more intoxicating. His rationality faded, emotions boiled, and controlling his instincts became increasingly difficult.\nFinally reaching the bed, Physis cautiously lifted the curtain.\nAs expected, Adilun was lying there in a somewhat provocative pose, looking up at him. Glancing at her bolder than usual negligée, Physis spoke in a slightly subdued voice.\n“Calling me in such an outfit… Are you saying I shouldn’t restrain myself?”\n“Exactly. We promised, didn’t we? Let’s cross the line today.”\n“Right.”\n“I’m ready, Physis. Just like I told you before, devour me.”\nShe opened her arms towards him, and Physis, without hesitation, walked towards her. They had both endured what felt like an eternity, all for this moment.\nConsequently, the instincts that had eroded his rationality now surfaced. His gaze grew sharper, more dangerous. Adilun looked back at him, still with a provocative expression.\n“I haven’t prepared anything special today. Since it’s our first time… I won’t ask you to be gentle. There’s no need for consideration either. However rough you want to be, however much you want to consume me, feel free to… come to me.”\nOnce Adilun’s permission was granted, Physis abandoned his own thoughts. Now, there was no longer any hesitation.\nHe climbed onto the bed, violently tore apart Adilun’s negligee, and even ripped his own clothes. It didn’t take much effort for his strong grip to tear the fabric.\n“Ah…”\nAdilun seemed to be enjoying the sight. Extreme excitement began to consume her mind. It wasn’t just Physis who had been holding back. How tirelessly had Adilun also struggled to suppress her boiling desires?\nEven the simulated intimacy they had engaged in last time had not satisfied her. She would have to see the end to quench this thirst.\nPhysis grabbed Adilun’s breasts, which were now erect with excitement.\n“…Haaah!”\nA different, intense sensation surged through Adilun’s mind unlike before.\nJust by grasping her breasts, the atmosphere Physis created, as if devouring her while ready to pounce in their first intimate encounter, amplified Adilun’s sensations, imbuing meaning into simple movements.\nIn contrast to his dangerous gaze, his movements were delicate. Caressing her breasts tenderly, Physis even bit Adilun’s nipple gently.\n“Ah!”\nAdilun was on the verge of being overwhelmed by the pleasure penetrating her mind. She hadn’t anticipated she would feel this intensely. Slowly, Physis sucked on her breasts, hoping she would be further aroused. And as he intended, Adilun soon began to wet her private part.\nWhile Physis caressed her breasts, their eyes eventually met. Gazing into each other’s blurry pupils, he pressed his lips against Adilun’s.\nThough he wanted to roughly shove his cock into her pussy right then and there, the last remaining shred of his rationality compelled Physis to treat Adilun gently. He obeyed that command without reservation.\nIsn’t it the first time about making each other feel good? In that initial intimacy, there shouldn’t be any harsh pain.\nPhysis waited patiently, observing Adilun’s growing excitement with anticipation. As intended, Adilun’s skin gradually started to turn red due to his affectionate and gentle skinship.\nPhysis recalled the time when Adilun had pleasured him orally. So, wasn’t it his turn this time? Physis lifted Adilun’s toe without any warning.\n“…Huh?”\nCaught off guard by his unexpected action, Adilun was perplexed. However, Physis paid no attention to her confusion and brought her toe to his mouth.\n“Ah!”\nSubsequently, a thrilling sensation started to surge from her toes.\nFrom the feet, to the leg, and finally, Physis’ mouth reached her thigh, now it was on the way to the most precious part of her body.\n“Wha- Physis?”\nWithout a word, Physis paid no heed to her question. He brought his mouth to her cunt, and began to slowly suck it.\n-Shuup\nA somewhat vulgar sound resonated and Adilun’s consciousness began to fade away.\n“Ah… Ahh!”\nShe tried to say something, but words failed her. In an instant, Adilun reached a light climax. The juice from her intimate area started to increase.\nPhysis’ action didn’t stop there. He grabbed Adilun’s horn, tenderly caressing it as he had done before. With a forceful motion, he bit into the horn, just as he had in the past.\n“Ah!”\nFocused on her more sensitive areas, Physis’s actions left Adilun unable to continue her train of thought. She could only writhe in pleasure and emit the alluring moans that excited Physis further.\nAs the cycle of pleasure continued, Adilun’s intimate area had by now reached a state where it could readily accept Physis’ penis. Instead of Adilun, who had momentarily paused her thoughts, it was now Physis who believed it was time to give in to instinct. He positioned his penis, which was swollen like it would explode at any moment, against Adilun’s vagina.\nAdilun seemed to have grasped the situation, looking at Physis with a mixture of apprehension and anticipation in her eyes.\nHaving rubbed his cock against her cunt before, Physis’ was able to insert his penis into her pussy naturally.\nFinally, the long-awaited first penetration between the two occurred.\nNo loud noises erupted. There was a faint, squelching sound as Physis’ penis slowly delved into Adilun’s vagina.\n“Ah, Ahh, no!… Ahh!”\n“Ha, Haa.”\nThe moans akin to screams and the low sighs clearly revealed the state of both individuals.\nThe pain that could wash away the pleasure they had experienced thus far surged through Adilun. Physis felt a surge of urgency, a sense that he could climax at any moment, as Adilun’s warm inside tightly grasped his penis.\nHowever, Physis had fully embraced Adilun’s provocation, and so he began to gradually penetrate her inside while suppressing the surging sensation of climax.\nAnd finally, as Physis’ penis delved into Adilun’s vagina, her hymen began to tear apart. The heightened pain caused Adilun to emit pained moans louder than before.\n“Ahhhh-”\nHearing Adilun’s moans, Physis paused momentarily. However, gripping the bedspread and enduring the pain, Adilun urged Physis.\n“…to the end, push it in. Don’t mind my pain… do what you desire.”\nSeeing her pitiable state, Physis felt a mix of sympathy and desire. Without further hesitation, he pushed his penis all the way up to Adilun’s womb.\n“Huuh!”\nIntense pain surged within Adilun’s inside. Had she ever experienced such pain in her life? Struggling to collect her thoughts amidst the agonizing pain, Physis leaned in and kissed her. His intention was to help her momentarily forget the pain.\nAlthough Adilun could use healing magic, she wished to preserve every moment, including the pain. That was why she refrained from using healing magic.\nWhile Physis couldn’t predict the extent of Adilun’s pain, he moved slowly and gently to minimize her discomfort. He continued to caress her stomach and exchange kisses.\nYet, the gentle motions turned progressively rougher within Adilun’s inside. The rational restraint that had been holding him back was eventually released by instinct.\n“Ah, Ahh!”\nAnd as Physis’ movements gained pace, Adilun began to experience a trace of pleasure amidst the intensifying pain.\nPerhaps because she was immersed in pain. The strength of that trace of pleasure was overwhelming. Adilun’s moans, mixed with desires she had never voiced before, escaped involuntarily. Those moans severed the last remnants of Physis’ rationality.\nGentleness? Consideration? Gradually, those things faded away. Succumbing to instinct, Physis began to thrust for his own sake. He grabbed Adilun’s breasts roughly, his previously tender demeanor turning wild.\n“Ah, Yes, Haaah!”\nWith ample foreplay, Adilun began to feel the intensifying pleasure. Even amidst Physis’ forceful movements, she realized her pain was decreasing and her pleasure was growing.\nAs Physis’ penis continued to violate Adilun’s inside, with each thrust, the magnitude of Adilun’s pleasure increased.\nHis huge thing clearly engraved its presence firmly within Adilun’s depths. At that moment, Adilun began to writhe in an overwhelming pleasure unlike anything she had experienced before.\n“Ah, Ahh!”\nUnable to form words, Adilun, lost in ecstasy, let out a moan in pleasure filled with sensations she had never known.\nYet this wasn’t a sensation like before—it was intense. Her body momentarily stiffened, and her eyes rolled slightly back. Even witnessing Adilun, who had reached the brink of losing consciousness due to pleasure, Physis didn’t cease his movements.\n“Huuh, Ahh!”\nAs Physis continued to move even in the midst of struggling in the climax, Adilun rolled her eyes and began to moan in succession soaked in pleasure. Physis did or didn’t, surrendering to his instinctive movements, he violated Adilun’s insides again and again like a madman.\nThe vulgar squelching sounds resonated between Adilun’s crotch and Physis’ penis, accompanied by the fierce collision of flesh against flesh, echoing through the bedroom.\nAnd with those sounds, Physis’ penis gradually swelled. Adilun’s already tight inner walls tightened even more due to her continuous climaxes, causing Physis’ penis to feel even more intense pleasure. Simultaneously, Physis’ semen began to pour forth from within him.\n“Ha, Haaah, Ahhh!”\nFinally, along with a warm sensation filling her body, Adilun briefly lost her senses in overwhelming happiness and pleasure.\nSubsequently, from the area where their genitals were joint, a dense and viscous semen began to seep out. The sheer volume was a testament to the immense restraint Physis had exercised.\nFinally releasing his essence within Adilun’s womb, Physis, gasping for air, looked at her before leaning down to kiss her and then overlapping his lips with hers.\nExhausted by the continuous climaxes, Adilun, though somewhat dazed, fused her lips with Physis in a half-conscious state, intertwining their tongues.\nThe issue was… Every time their tongues mixed, Physis’ penis began to swell again within Adilun’s inside.\nAdilun seemed to notice this, gazing at Physis with a hint of bewilderment.\n“Ph-Physis”\nPhysis just stared down at Adilun with dangerous eyes. Realizing she had awakened a beast she shouldn’t have, Adilun understood the situation from his expression.\nWith his gaze unfocused, Physis grabbed onto Adilun’s waist once again.\n“Wait, just a moment! Ahh!”\nHowever, that moment meant nothing; Physis started to move his waist again. Despite Adilun still being in the aftermath of her climax, she couldn’t help but moan in pleasure as Physis’ penis thrust roughly into her body.\nThe pain from their initial connection was now nowhere to be found, replaced by pure pleasure that once again shook her mind. Adilun tightly wrapped her legs around Physis’ waist, clinging to him.\nPhysis continued to shake his hips. It didn’t stop at just one or two times. After three rounds of climax, his throbbing penis, slick with a mixture of fluids, continued to ravish Adilun’s sensitive inner walls. Only after the seventh climax did Physis manage to regain his senses briefly.\nAnd as Physis regained his composure, Adilun…\n“Haah… Haaah”\nIn her dazed state, she slightly stuck out her tongue and rolled her eyes back. Surprisingly, despite Physis ejaculating so many times, Adilun had never once allowed his essence to spill outside her vagina. Throughout those seven climaxes, every drop of Physis release had entered her womb.\n“….Are you okay?”\n“Yes…”\nAdilun, somewhat coming to her senses from Physis’ tender words, replied in a half-dazed manner. As soon as she responded, Physis once again grabbed her waist.\n“Huh…?”\nCurious, Adilun’s gaze met Physis’. Physis brought his hand from her waist to her belly, caressing it gently… then he slowly pushed his penis back into Adilun’s vagina.\nSince she said she was fine, he figured he could continue a little more, rationalizing to himself.\n“Ah, Aaaah!”\nOf course, Adilun’s mind once again surrendered to pleasure, and she moaned as if intoxicated.\nAnd so, the two of them concluded their first day together like this.",

      "content": "Ordinary couples, after a few times, would fall asleep together, wake up to the morning sunlight, look at each other, exchange smiles, and go through the usual routines.\nHowever, such an ordinary scenario didn’t apply to Physis and Adilun. Because…\n“Ah, yes!”\n…Their lovemaking continued without ceasing until the break of day.\nAdilun no longer had any intention of hiding her desires. She simply surrendered herself to Physis’ explorations, letting her body be taken by his touch and losing herself in the pleasure he gave.\nWhile most people would get tired right away after having sex a few times, these two were an exception. Adilun had awakened as a full-fledged dragon, her already exceptional stamina increasing by more than double. And Physis’ stamina was extraordinary to begin with.\nFurthermore, after the battle with the Demon King, he had grown even stronger. Now possessing monstrous stamina, he could engage in their passionate lovemaking for a week straight without tiring.\nSo now that the two of them had discovered the pleasure of exploring each other, there was no way they could stop.\nAs if addicted to each other’s bodies, they quenched their thirst while forsaking even meals.\n“Ahh, Haaah, haaah, haaaah…”\nAdilun exhaled roughly as she took in Physis’ cock into her pussy. Her inside, already soaked from having received Physis’ semen seven times before, naturally accepted his cock again. The initial pain she felt had vanished completely; now, every time Physis thrust his hips, she moaned in ecstasy, her eyes rolling back.\nWhat was astonishing was that she never lost her senses. Perhaps due to her determination to drain Physis’ stamina completely, even though she had reached climax dozens of times by now, she still maintained her composure, expertly milking Physis’ cock with her moist pussy.\nPerhaps because of Adilun’s soft inside or the fact that Physis was already on his eighth climax, he couldn’t hold back any longer. He ejaculated deep inside her, and just like the first time, his thick semen filled her womb.\n“Aaaaaah!”\nAdilun screamed in pleasure.\nShe couldn’t escape the sensation of something warm filling her belly, and she surrendered herself to this intoxicating pleasure as if addicted to it.\nWith her mind soaked in pleasure, as if not wanting to miss a single drop of his semen, Adilun strongly wrapped her legs around Physis’ waist. He had changed positions several times already, but not once did Adilun allow Physis to ejaculate outside of her vagina.\nSeeing her determination to become pregnant no matter what, Physis’ passion grew stronger… reaching his eighth climax.\nNot only did she surrender her body to pleasure, but she also pressed her lips against Physis’, exchanging saliva and sending him a sticky gaze that seemed to say she wouldn’t let go for a moment longer.\n“Can you still go on…?”\nSeeing Adilun asked quite provocatively, Physis snarled at her with eyes that had completely transformed.\n“Of course. I told you, I won’t let you rest,”\n“Hehe… Ahhh… Hah, ahn! I love you, I love you Physis, I love you…”\nAdilun’s provocation mixed with affection once again captivated Physis’ mind.\nThe two of them didn’t stop. Their stamina was still overflowing like crazy, thanks to Adilun’s secret concoction of various enchantments, which had enhanced their already abundant stamina twofold.\nVarious high-level magic spells were cast, all for the sake of their intimacy, and anyone, it might seem outrageous.\nRegardless, Physis flipped Adilun’s body over. Even though he had already planted his seed within her multiple times, the beastly desire within him couldn’t be satisfied.\nAdilun understood his intentions and extended her buttocks towards him, they both looked like a beast seeking to mate. While the way Physis’ cock pressed against her pussy could be likened to a forceful intrusion, for someone who eagerly longed for a connection with their beloved, it posed no issue at all.\nLikewise, driven by his intense desire for her, Physis thrust his cock inside Adilun’s pussy.\n“Ahhhh!”\nNo matter how familiar the sensation had become, when Physis’ cock entered her, Adilun, who was already on the edge of overwhelming pleasure, couldn’t suppress her moans.\n“I love you. I love you Adilun. I love you…”\nPhysis, with his upper body leaning over her back, repeated the words in her ear. It was as if that was the only thing he knew how to say.\nAdilun’s face flushed red upon hearing those words. The sweet utterance, heard in the midst of her mounting climax from Physis, who had repeatedly pierced her depths, began amplifying her sensations.\n“Haaa! Aaah!”\nAnd in that moment, after reaching climax from Physis’s ejaculation not long ago, she found herself at the peak once again, releasing her love juice.\nPhysis seemed satisfied with her reaction, and he gently stroked her belly, so that she could be more immersed in pleasure. As a firm hand gently stroked her belly, Adilun was able to concentrate on the afterglow of the climax.\nTrue ecstasy surged through Adilun’s entire being, causing her to involuntarily roll her eyes back.\n“Ugh, Ahhhh…”\nAs the echoes of her climax lingered, Physis couldn’t help but be excited by her response…\n“Haaah!”\nDriven by instinct once more, he thrust into her pussy as if possessed.\n“Aaah! Ah, Haa! Ha-aaah!”\nWith his merciless movements, Adilun was unable to regain her senses before being overtaken again. However, regaining her senses was not something she desired.\nPhysis didn’t stop.\n“Ha, haa… Haaa…”\nAdilun’s ragged breath flowed from her lips. Exhausted, she collapsed onto the bed, and Physis’ sturdy physique enveloped her.\n“Huh, huuuu.”\nAdilun, barely regaining her composure, felt Physis’ body heat as he was on top of her. She turned her head slightly. Beast-like eyes were fixed on her.\nPhysis pressed his lips against Adilun’s. She also kissed him again as if reciprocating.\nAgain and again, repeatedly.\nPhysis lifted Adilun into his arms and settled her on his lap.\nAffection lingered in their gaze looking at each other, and lust surrounded the outside of that affection. Without needing to say who would lead, once again, their bodies intertwined.\nThis time, Physis didn’t take the lead. His gaze, ignited by Adilun’s warmth, made him realize what she desired. So he held her close, his arms wrapped around her, and did nothing but embrace her.\nAdilun with Physis’ cock inside began to move her hips. Their sticky and wet parts met, and a lewd sound echoed once more.\n“Aaah! Haah!”\nPerhaps due to heightened excitement, even Physis’ face flushed.\nThough he remained still, Physis’ hands were not idle. As she moved her hips, he gently massaged her breasts.\n“Ahhhh-!”\nAdilun, in return, pulled Physis’ face more intensely into her breasts. Physis buried his nose in her cleavage, inhaling her scent. Like a child nursing from its mother, he suckled on her large breasts. When Physis lovingly caressed her erect nipple, Adilun seemed to be overcome with happiness.\n“It feels good…”\nThe words she muttered in a low voice also represented Physis’ feelings. It wasn’t just about relieving their lust but also about the outpouring of their affection, making the happiness they felt overflow.\nAdilun’s movements grew more intense. Physis followed suit. He kissed her neck tenderly, caressed her breasts, and pressed his lips against her shoulder.\n“Huh!”\nJust as horns serve as sensitive spots, it seemed Adilun’s shoulder played a similar role, as her movements, driven by pleasure, momentarily ceased.\nHow many times had they reached climax? Perhaps it was due to Adilun’s sensitivity, but it seemed more likely that the surge of emotional and physical satisfaction prompted them to reach climax faster than before.\nAdilun’s movements gradually intensified. Physis was doing the same. He pressed her breasts with care, placing his lips on her neck.\n“Ahhh!”\nLikewise, just as with the horns and shoulder, Physis noticed that Adilun’s neck was also a sensitive spot that could heighten her pleasure. Her rhythmic movements temporarily ceased.\nBut Physis wasn’t about to let Adilun rest. Under normal circumstances, he would have been considerate, but now, all restraints were off. He didn’t want to let Adilun rest like this.\nHe wanted to continue witnessing Adilun’s passionate form, writhing in climax, and the sound of her affectionate cries. It was an unrestrained state. He wouldn’t allow her to rest.\nGiven that it was Adilun who had initially asked him to devour her, Physis was committed to following her request.\nPhysis gently stroked Adilun’s head, who buried her head in his shoulder. And in the midst of it… his gaze was captivated by her large horn.\nEnjoying the sensation of Adilun’s pussy tightening around his erect cock, he wanted to witness her succumb even more to pleasure.\nPhysis stood up. As he had done before, he put his hard teeth into the horn of Adilun, who buried his head in his shoulder.\n“Ah-aah!”\nThis alone was enough to push Adilun, who was already on the brink of ecstasy, into spasms. Physis continued to stimulate her horn. On the smooth surface, the hard teeth began to leave their mark.\nAnd because of the sensation, the inside of Adilun’s pussy squeezed Physis’ cock. Along with that, a sloppy juice flowed from her crotch and began to wet Physis’ lower abdomen.\n“Me, I… I feel like I’m going to die…”\n“Just from this?”\n“Let’s rest for a bit, okay? I’m so happy, and it feels so good… I feel like I’m going to lose my mind. It’s too much, too overwhelming…”\n“I told you.”\nPhysis’ soft voice echoed in Adilun’s ear.\n“I won’t let you rest.”\n“Huh… Ahhh…”\nBefore Adilun could say anything, Physis had already laid her back onto the bed. Then, he gazed down at Adilun, a complex mixture of anticipation and apprehension.\nHe began to dominate her once more.\nHow much time had passed? Adilun woke up from her hazy state. She had almost fallen unconscious, yet she could still hear herself moaning with pleasure as Physis continued to violate her. Now, she could see Physis looking at her affectionately, her feelings intertwined with a sense of longing.\nPhysis’ skin was flushed. Adilun, who had wondered if he had somewhat been released from his restrained desire, couldn’t help but pout slightly.\n“That is unfair.”\n“You were the one who asked me not to stop.”\n“Still… …It’s very unfair. I mean, It was so intense, so overwhelming. I’m the only one falling behind. Perhaps it’s because my first time-”\n“-If you think about it that way, it’s also the first time I’ve ever had a relationship with a woman.”\n“… …Huh?”\n“I in previous life… … No, I mean, I’ve never had a relationship with another woman, even in the future life.”\n“Really?”\n“Yes.”\n“I heard from Mina that no man gives women pleasure from their first time…”\n“Maybe it’s because I used my body well. Because I have confidence in using my body.”\n“…Is that so?”\nPhysis ran his fingers through Adilun’s hair, giving her a gentle caress, his touch full of affection. The atmosphere was heavy with the lingering aftermath of their intense passion.\nPhysis seemed to be going to roll his eyes again, but it seemed like Adilun should take a break now. She needed a little break. She was hungry and thirsty too.\nThe bed was already soaked with their bodily fluids. Even though they could easily clean it with a cleanliness spell, Physis could only nod when Adilun questioned why bother with cleanliness magic since it would inevitably get dirty again.\nAfter all, it was Adilun who would be casting the magic.\n“Let’s slow down a little. I… I’m exhausted. Even though I’ve trained my stamina so much, to feel like this… Aren’t you tired?”\n“Me? Not at all.”\n“Sigh. That’s a shame…”\n“Why?”\n“I wanted to see you getting frustrated with me again…”\n“Aren’t I already doing enough of that? Honestly, I’m holding back even now. If you hadn’t told me to slow down, I wouldn’t have tried to rest.”\n“…Yes. But aren’t you hungry?”\n“I’m starting to feel hungry, yes. Are you?”\n“I am too.”\n“How about I fetch us some inn food?”\nAt Physis’ suggestion, Adilun shook her head.\nIt was like re-opening the time barrier that she had worked so hard on, and even if she did, it would be dawn outside now.\nAdilun waved her hand, pulling preserved meals from the pocket dimension. They were composed of relatively simple dishes, all of them retaining their freshness due to preservation magic.\n“Oh.”\nWhile Physis was marveling, Adilun had already picked up a sandwich and taken a bite.\nPhysis followed suit, taking a bite of his own sandwich. The combination of fresh vegetables, well-cooked meat, and sweet sauce invigorated their hungry bodies.\n“How is it?”\n“It’s delicious. Did you make this too?”\n“Yes. I wanted to cook for you personally. I did the same during our picnic.”\n“Thank you. It feels like I’m only receiving from you.”\n“No, it’s not like that. Just being with you is enough for me. I do it because I want to.”\n“Thank you.”\nPhysis smiled softly, and Adilun returned the smile.\nAfter finishing the sandwiches and sipping some wine, their bodies were once again heating up. The exchange of intense gazes led them to intertwining their bodies once more.\nTheir lust continued to resonate. Inside the time barrier, three days had passed in the blink of an eye.\n* * *\nOn the third day, as Adilun struggled and couldn’t keep up with Physis’ stamina, Physis slowed down a bit. He tenderly caressed and moved slowly, bit by bit.\nHowever, even so, the overflowing lust wasn’t going anywhere, so he soon shifted his gaze again and seized her horns.\nFor Physis, who was so passionately attentive, Adilun yielded herself to his touch willingly. Seeing Physis gripping her horns firmly, realizing that he desired her mouth, Adilun erected a mana barrier. The same situation as when she had eased his lust before began to unfold.\nPhysis’ cock began to find its way to Adilun’s mouth. Adilun, in return, tenderly caressed Physis’ cock. The transparent liquid oozing from the tip of his cock moistened Adilun’s throat, and Adilun’s tongue made a vulgar sound as it licked Physis’s cock.\n“Ugh…”\nAs Adilun’s tongue licked the tip of his cock, Physis found it hard to restrain himself and almost immediately tried to release himself, but Adilun didn’t allow him to climax.\nMana wrapped around Physis’ cock, preventing its attempt to ejaculate. Physis began to make sounds of agony as he couldn’t release the intense build-up of semen.\n“Ugh, Adilun…”\nAs Physis thought Adilun would take it into her mouth as she had before and she suddenly declined, not knowing the situation, he merely looked at her with confusion. Only after confirming Adilun’s expression did Physis see that she was making a mischievous face.\n“No way…”\n“Didn’t I tell you? I said I’d do it until I get pregnant. So… I’ll need all of your seed inside my womb.”\nAdilun grabbed Physis’ cock and pressed it against her wet pussy. Physis, wanting to release his semen no matter what, grabbed her hips and began to thrust again.\n“Ah, ah! Haah… Yes, more, do it more…”\nPleasure flowed through Adilun’s brain, piercing from the tip of Physis’ cock to her own brain. At that moment, the blocked passage of Physis’ cock, sealed by magic, opened, and within it, white semen began to pour into Adilun’s inside.\n“Haah…”\nA satisfying moan echoed in Physis’ ears, and any thoughts of being considerate to Adilun faded. Yet, Adilun had grown quite accustomed. Instead, she began to etch magic into their bodies.\nThe intensified sensation of the magic melted their bodies. Drenched in pleasure, they sought out even more pleasure, confirming their love for each other in various positions, and expelled love juices from themselves.\n“Ah, aah! Ahh!”\n“Ha Ha Ha!”\nAmidst their exchanged moans and breaths, another climax took place. Now it was difficult to even count, but Physis’ ejaculate still remained potent, not thinning out. Adilun’s pussy welcomed the new ejaculate with joy.\nHer body trembled once more, and a powerful vibration echoed from her lower abdomen.\nOnce again, they reached their peak. Their intimacy continued beyond the third day, lasting until the next morning. After a short rest, they intertwined their bodies once more.\nThere was still strength left in them.\nOn the fifth day, Adilun cast a new spell. It allowed them to fully share each other’s sensations. She wanted to know what pleasure Physis felt in her body, and how her pleasure resonated with him.\nThe results were astonishing.\n“Ah, ah!”\n“Haaa, Haa! Haaa!”\nPhysis’s entire body trembled, and Adilun was no different. The pleasure of a man entering a woman’s body and the pleasure of a woman accepting a man collided within them.\nThis pleasure, far beyond any intense pleasure they had felt before, held a horrifying addictiveness that engulfed them both.\nFurthermore, now that Adilun was at the peak of her fertility, she was even more sensitive to pleasure. It felt like her mind was paralyzed by the intensity of this pleasure.\n“Ah, Haaa, aah… What, what is this? I feel like I’m going insane…”\n“Ugh, Haaah.”\nPhysis, too, couldn’t extricate himself from the intense pleasure. Adilun attempted to release the spell, but she couldn’t. The desire not to escape from the intense and addictive sensations was stronger.\nThis held true for Physis as well, and ultimately, both of them lost their sanity.\nTransformed into beasts moved solely by instinct, they both shook their hips madly, their mouths and tongues intertwined, saliva exchanged, and they licked and sucked each other’s genitals, indulging in all sorts of pleasures.\nAnd then, their genitals connected once again. At their point of union, white fluid mixed with a smooth, transparent liquid, creating white foam. Both of them were consumed by each other’s sensations.\n“Ah, Haa! Ahh!”\n“Ahhhh!”\nTheir consciousness momentarily faded, but as slaves to pleasure, they didn’t stop.\nWithin the confines of the time barrier, they forgot the passage of time, succumbing solely to their procreative instincts. Physis continued to thrust his cock into Adilun’s pussy while gripping her breasts tightly, ejaculating semen. Adilun welcomed his semen eagerly, not missing a single drop, as she kept her womb wide open.\nThe semen that had been sprayed on Adilun’s womb on the first day of intercourse had already been scratched by Physis. He continued pouring fresh semen into Adilun’s womb.\nUntil the day she conceived.\nTheir lovemaking lasted until the seventh day, and if Adilun hadn’t completely lost consciousness and fainted during it, the relationship would have persisted.\n…And just like that they both tried to fulfill their sexual desire.",

      "content": "Chapter 95: Marriage (1)\n[Physis’ POV]\nThe morning was bright.\nBathed in sunlight, I looked at Adilun, who had fallen asleep beside me, worn out. Just looking at her made me smile uncontrollably; it was as if I had a serious case of joy.\nFor almost a week, we had been passionately making love without a break. So waking up immediately would undoubtedly be hard for her.\nI had unleashed all the pent-up desires that had accumulated within me, so even with her considerable stamina... it might have been too much for her to handle.\nI carefully wrapped my arms around Adilun. It felt cozy and warm.\nHappiness wasn’t something to be found somewhere else; perhaps this very moment was happiness itself.\nAfter a short time had passed, Adilun stirred briefly and eventually opened her eyes. I had thought she wouldn’t fully regain consciousness until at least this evening, but perhaps it was due to the stamina she had built up last time.\n“Mmm...”\nBlinking in the sunlight, she looked at me.\n“...Physis?”\n“Yes. Did you sleep well?”\nWhen I asked if she slept well, she puffed up her cheeks slightly and said,\n“I feel like I couldn’t rest properly because someone wore me out. I feel tired.”\n“So, you didn’t like it?”\n“...No. I loved it. A lot.”\nHer cheeks flushed as she spoke, and she looked incredibly adorable. Unable to resist, I pressed my lips against hers.\n“Mmm...”\nShe accepted my affection without resistance. Although I felt myself becoming aroused again, I had to hold back this time, given that I had worn her out over what amounted to a week, both in real and subjective time.\nShe seemed to have realized that as well, and her face turned red as she spoke to me.\n“...You.”\n“Yes?”\n“Do you...still find me lacking?”\n“...To be honest, while I was keep going, you fainted from exhaustion.”\n“No wonder my back hurts more than usual...I guess I’ll need to work on building my stamina.”\n“I’m sorry.”\n“Hehe. You don’t have to be. I’m really happy that you still want me. So...”\nStill drowsy, her sleepy eyes met mine, and with her next words, she completely stole my soul.\n“You’re not allowed to look at other women. I’m the only woman for you.”\nThat settles it. I immediately grabbed her arm. Given that it was already morning and I was already aroused, hearing such words made it even harder to hold back.\n“Yo-you? I’m having a hard time right now...”\n“I’m sorry. I can’t help myself.”\n“Kyaa!”\nWhether her shriek was one of joy or exhaustion, I couldn’t tell, but we ended up having a late lunch only when the afternoon arrived.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nWhen we stayed inside our room for three days straight, the inn staff seemed increasingly concerned. The door was magically locked, and no sounds came from within.\nThey must have been worried that something had gone wrong. However, when we eventually emerged, refreshed and glowing, the staff seemed relieved that their concerns were unnecessary.\n“So, do you want to eat some more?”\n“Yes. I haven’t really eaten much... I’m starving after spending all this time with you.”\n“Let’s go, then.”\nThe inn meals were quite exquisite. Considering many nobles frequented the place for leisure, it was clear that a great deal of care had gone into the preparation.\nAfter a rather filling meal, Adilun and I went back to admire the sea.\n“The ocean is really fascinating, isn’t it?”\n“How so?”\n“Every time you look at it, it’s different.”\n“Is that so?”\n“Yes.”\nAdilun was quietly gazing at the ocean.\n“Look. The way the sunlight glimmers on the water—you don’t see that in the evening. It feels like a sight you can only catch in the middle of the day. And then at night, the ocean takes on the color of the night sky, reflecting the occasional stars above.”\n“That’s true.”\n“That’s why I love it. As time changes, so does the ocean. It’s different from Rodenov, which always seems the same. It’s a bit amazing, really.”\n“Is that so?”\n“Yes. It might sound strange since it’s my first time seeing the ocean, but maybe it’s precisely because it’s my first time that I find it so affecting.”\n“Could be.”\nThe conversation halted there. Adilun gripped my arm and nestled into me. I wrapped my arm around her shoulder.\nIt was a peaceful moment. Even without conversation, wasn’t it enough just to have each other by our sides?\nThe view was more pleasing than I had expected. Indeed, I felt it was a good decision to come see the ocean.\n“We should head back. We have to leave soon tomorrow.”\n“Alright.”\n.\n.\n.\n.\nReturning to our room, we both freshened up briefly. Then, lying in bed together, I listened to Adilun’s stories, yielding to her fervent request that we take it easy for the night.\n“Hey.”\n“Mm-hmm.”\n“So, at this point... It’s pretty much guaranteed, right?”\n“What is?”\n“Our baby.”\n“Uh...”\nI was momentarily at a loss for words. Honestly, considering what we’ve been up to for the past week, it’d be more surprising if a baby didn’t happen. But having a child wasn’t something that came about just because you wanted it to.\n“Well, I’m not sure, but... given what we’ve been doing, it’s likely, isn’t it?”\n“I thought so too.”\nHer smile was radiant, but somehow, I could sense a touch of anxiety in it.\n“Why bring this up all of a sudden?”\n“Ah, it’s nothing. I was just thinking... it would be nice if it happened sooner rather than later.”\n“Really?”\n“Yes. We’re getting married soon anyway, so who would mind if it happened a little early?”\n“True.”\n“Aren’t you excited? To have a child with me?”\n“Of course... I’d love it if they arrived sooner rather than later. Ideally, a daughter who takes after you.”\n“I’d actually prefer a son who takes after you.”\n“How about we have both?”\n“Ah! That’s even better!”\nFor some reason, her innocently enthusiastic response stirred up my desire. But I remembered her words about taking it easy tonight, and I forcefully quelled my urges.\n“Anyway... I hope it happens soon. I wonder how beautiful our child will be.”\n“Wouldn’t it be difficult for you? I’ve heard it’s very hard.”\n“I think I’ll be okay.”\nHer tone was steady, and I could even sense a certain level of resolution in her words.\n“If I considered having a child to be a hardship, then I don’t deserve to be a mother. So, I’m fine.”\n“Alright.”\n“If it doesn’t happen this time, let’s keep trying until it does. What do you say?”\n“I’m fine with it, but you should probably build up some stamina for that.”\n“Mm-hmm.”\nI lightly kissed her flushed face and pulled her close. Within my arms, I felt her warmth and the softness of her skin.\n“Once we return tomorrow, let’s start preparing for the wedding right away.”\nShe spoke cautiously from within my embrace.\n“We will be very busy.”\n“Definitely. We need to look at dresses and everything...”\n“Well, I have plenty of time, so I’m not worried. Are you sure you’ll be okay? You have a ton of responsibilities, from heir training to other tasks.”\n“I’ll be fine. If things get tough, I’ll just take it out on you.”\n“...Hahahaha. Anyway, let’s get some sleep. We’ll be busy starting tomorrow.”\n“Yes.”\n.\n.\n.\n.\nFinally, the day of departure arrived. In actual days, our eight-day journey was now over, and in real-world time, our four-day trip had concluded. We headed toward the teleportation gate that would take us back to Rodenov.\nBefore leaving, we made sure to take one last look at the ocean. At Adilun’s request to see the sea in the early morning, we beheld the scenery one final time and stored it in our memories before using the teleportation gate to return to Rodenov.\nAh, before using the teleportation gate, we also thanked Marquis and Marquess of Magnolia for showing us such a lovely inn and promised to recommend it to the northern nobility when the opportunity arose. We expressed deep gratitude for their hospitality and vowed to return.\nAll in all, it was quite a lengthy journey. Though the extent of our activities consisted of exploring the port city and passionately trying to conceive a child in our room, it was, undoubtedly, a series of happy moments.\nAs we returned, the visages of Duke Johannes and Lady Claudia greeted us warmly.\n“You both look so happy; you must have had a wonderful trip.”\n“Yes, we’re back.”\n“Indeed.”\n“Has everything been alright, Father?”\n“Yes, nothing special happened.”\n“Hehe, that’s a relief.”\n“First, let’s have a meal. We’ll talk details later. Go unpack your luggage for now.”\n“Yes.”\nAt the dinner table that followed, Adilun began sharing stories from our trip. She spoke of the Magnolia family’s inn, the people in the port city, and the treatment we received there.\n“Ah, so those things happened? Sounds like a fun time.”\n“Yes. It was especially surprising to see that their culture also venerates dragons.”\n“Wasn’t the sea originally a place where legends of dragons have been passed down? It makes sense.”\n“And the ocean itself was stunning. The way it changes depending on the time of day was simply breathtaking. Some days, we spent the whole day just watching the sea.”\n“Next time, we should all go together.”\n“Sounds good!”\nAs light conversations flowed, smiles appeared on everyone’s faces. Sensing the relaxed atmosphere, Adilun seemed to decide it was time to bring up the topic of marriage.\nThen, her lips cautiously parted.\n“...We’re thinking of setting a wedding date.”\n“You’ve made up your minds?”\n“Yes. Our engagement has been long enough, and I think it’s time to put the final touches on it. I’ve already discussed this with Physis. We want to get married as soon as possible.”\n“Very well. If that’s what both of you want, then so be it. Marriage is not only about the families but also the wishes of the individuals involved.”\n“Thank you.”\n“There will be many things to prepare. When do you plan to set the date?”\n“We’re aiming for next month. We’ll have to invite people to match that date.”\n“Alright.”\nTo Duke Johannes, who nodded meekly, I opened my mouth and said.\n“I will tell Ortaire. They’ve been waiting for a while, so it’s only right that I should be the one to inform them.”\n“Understood. Keep it that way.”\nAnd just then, Lady Claudia, who had been watching everything with a contented look, suddenly posed a question.\n“How many children are you planning to have?”\nAt the question, Adilun blushed slightly before responding.\n“Well, as many as possible.”\n“Oh my!”\nLady Claudia’s beaming expression suggested she was eager to see grandchildren from Adilun and me sooner rather than later. Apparently, she had some regrets about only having a single child.\nIn any case, after the eventful dinner, Rodenov was buzzing with wedding preparations.\nAfter dinner, I moved all my belongings into Adilun’s room: clothes, and various other items.\nIt was because the Duke and Duchess suggested that, as we were soon to be married, it made more sense for us to share a room.\nAs far as I was concerned, it was welcome news. I immediately nodded in agreement and followed their suggestion.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "Chapter 96: Marriage (2)\n[Physis’ POV]\nAfter the wedding date was set, we were incredibly busy.\nInside Rodenov, preparations began for my wedding with Adilun. We went through the ceremonial procedures, changing what needed to be changed and pushing forward with the rest.\nWe started with small details like the menu for the wedding, then moved onto bigger decisions like the location and the guest list.\nWe even sent out invitations to the northern nobles we had met in the past. Regardless of whether we had a good or bad relationship, they were significant figures in the North, people we would inevitably have to deal with as future leaders of Rodenov. So, despite our reservations, we had no choice but to invite them.\nPeople like Selina Idenea, and William Devarton, who had been a thorn in my side.\nWe also sent out invitations to those who could be called friends, like Isla Isvante and Princess Lobelia.\nFor some reason, Adilun insisted on inviting Aristata Glosuna. Seeing her strong determination, I simply nodded in agreement.\nIn truth, I didn’t really have anyone I could call a friend.\nIn any case, after sending out the invitations, we immediately headed to Ortaire. I couldn’t just send an invitation to my parents and leave it at that.\n“Will we be back soon?”\n“You never know, so we should pack. Who knows what whims my mother might have.”\n“I see.”\nWe could have simply announced the marriage and returned, but I was certain my parents would want to talk more to Adilun and me. In the end, we headed to Ortaire with a considerable amount of luggage.\n“Welcome back.”\nMy father, mother, and brother greeted us with happy faces.\nEspecially since this was our first visit since the monster subjugation, the color had returned to my parents’ faces.\n“So, it’s been a while. Has the issue in the North been resolved?”\n“Yes, the North is currently stable. What about Tallet-ram? Any signs of an attack?”\nWhat I was concerned about was a possible invasion from Tallet-ram, an eastern nation. But this was different from the issues we had previously faced.\n“Don’t worry. As long as I’m here, they can’t cross into our territory. Also, for some reason, there’s been less pressure from the central region recently.”\n“From the central region?”\n“Yes. Apparently, Princess Lobelia has been making some power moves... Especially, there are rumors that the daughter of Crocus Glosuna has rebelled against Crocus himself. I’m not exactly sure what’s going on, but it doesn’t seem like it’s going to spill over to our end. They appear to be busy with their own affairs. So naturally, with less pressure from the center, I can focus entirely on the east, making it impossible for them to invade.”\n“I see...”\nThis, too, was unexpected. The central region? What could have happened there? Was Adilun’s insistence on inviting Aristata related to this?\nPerhaps there were stories involving her in events I was unaware of, events that Adilun had experienced before her time-travel.\nRegardless, when we told them we would be getting married next month, both my parents visibly lit up with joy.\n“Finally getting married, huh.”\nTheir faces were a mix of myriad emotions. Both my mother and father looked at me with such faces. Well, it was only natural. Their troublesome son was finally settling down, and the sentiment was undoubtedly overwhelming for them.\n“Brother, you should also be getting married soon.”\n“When the time comes, I will.”\n“Lately, I’ve been worried because of Huian; he just doesn’t show any interest in women.”\n“Ah, Father, I’ll find a suitable woman and marry when the time is right.”\n“Who is this ‘suitable woman’? You don’t have anyone you can’t tell me about, do you?”\n“No, not at all. I just want to focus on my work a bit more for now.”\nMy brother, who still had no romantic partner to speak of, said he was buried in his work. My parents found this both frustrating and worrying, but my brother seemed irritated by their concern. I wondered if he was seeing someone he hadn’t told us about.\nRegardless, the conversation about us continued. My mother was particularly pleased to see Adilun casually referring to me in an informal tone, signaling that our relationship had deepened.\nWhen asked about our plans for children, we cautiously responded that there would probably be quite a few. My mother said she was happy just to know that.\n“Anyway, you both have been through a lot, and I hope only good things are in store for you from now on. Marriage is essentially about moving forward in mutual trust... So don’t create reasons to doubt each other, and don’t test each other either. That’s the way to make it last.”\n“Yes.”\n“Just remember that. Considering how you two have been, there’s probably no need to worry too much... But still, some couples do grow apart right after marriage.”\n“Yes.”\n“Anyway, since you’ve come to Ortaire, why not stay for about three days? There’s much I want to discuss, and I’m also curious about what happened in the North.”\nAt my mother’s words, we both nodded. We had already anticipated this.\nI thought to myself how wise it had been to pack our belongings in advance.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThere was no need to separate rooms, so Adilun settled right into mine.\n“Phew. Now that I’ve shared everything, I can finally breathe a sigh of relief. Ah, things have been so busy lately.”\n“It can’t be helped. Marriage naturally requires a lot of effort.”\n“Hehe, right?”\n“Yeah. Oh, Adilun.”\n“Hm?”\n“I wanted to ask... what was the reason you insisted on inviting Princess Aristata? Is it related to what we heard today?”\n“Ah, that. Before I experienced the time-travel, the North was annihilated, and the only person who reached out to me was her. I was cautious at first when I knew nothing... but now that I know everything, there’s no reason to be cautious anymore.”\n“...Aristata?”\n“Yes. If the North had been in good shape, she would somehow be able to turn the tide and oust her father from the family. But the North was annihilated, and everything moved too quickly, and she couldn’t stop her rampaging father.”\n“So that happened.”\n“Yes. That’s why I intend to maintain a close relationship with her this time too. The events currently unfolding in the Central region are likely being led by Aristata and Princess Lobelia. Especially now that the North is in good shape... Aristata would have been the right person to scheme with. The person who was there for me when I lost everything is someone I can’t afford to lose.”\n“I see.”\nI simply nodded. I couldn’t dare to imagine the kind of pain she had gone through, but if someone had reached out to her during that time, she couldn’t simply ignore them, not even if time had reversed.\n“So, how about... we spend some time just the two of us today?”\nAt Adilun’s subtle temptation, I nodded. We had been too busy preparing for our wedding recently to be intimate. My body was already craving touch, so I easily agreed to her suggestion.\n“Then, shall we make the most of today?”\nAs Adilun casually spoke, I pressed my lips to hers as a starting point. A passionate exploration of each other had now become a familiar act for us.\nFor the record... we had entered at lunchtime and didn’t come out until it was time for dinner. Of course, thanks to Adilun’s time magic, it was as if two days had passed.\n...I had a thought that it might not be long after our marriage that Adilun’s belly might be swollen.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nDuring dinner, the conversation still revolved around us. Particularly, the fact that Adilun and I had defeated the Demon King caught even my father by surprise.\nAnd it was no small feat—this was the Demon King. The East was not devoid of monsters, and the Demon King stood as the pinnacle among them.\nAt my young age of only twenty-one, the Demon King wasn’t something that should be easily dealt with. My father offered his praises for my astonishing accomplishment.\nIn any case, many more stories followed, and the dinner gathering wrapped up in a warm and harmonious atmosphere.\nReturning to the room, I briefly excused myself to Adilun and went to find my mother.\nI had a personal favor to ask.\n“Hmm? Physis? What brings you here?”\nMy mother, leisurely enjoying the night view in the garden, looked at me with a hint of curiosity.\n“Ah, well, there’s something I’d like to ask of you.”\n“A favor? That’s unexpected. What is it?”\n“I’d like to be introduced to a skilled jeweler, if you know one.”\n“A jeweler? Ah.”\n“...”\nMy mother seemed to grasp my intent immediately and looked at me with a gentle smile.\n“Of course. You’re getting married, so you’ll need to prepare wedding rings.”\n“To be frank, I have an abysmal eye for jewelry, so I’ll definitely need your help, Mother. So, would it be alright if we go look at some jewelry tomorrow?”\n“Absolutely. Are you planning a proposal?”\n“Yes.”\n“Hehe, Adilun will be delighted. I hope it will be a romantic proposal. For a woman, it’s an incredibly meaningful and unforgettable day.”\n“...I’ll do my best.”\n“My son, who used to be so aggressive, has changed like this. Truly, it’s something to be seen in a new light. Now, you even know how to take care of your wife.”\n“...Haha.”\nI could only respond with an awkward smile.\nMy mother warmly gazed at me before giving her definitive answer.\n“Alright. Let’s go out for a bit tomorrow. I know a jeweler I exclusively work with; I’m sure they can craft something exquisite.”\n“Yes.”\n“You should go now. Oh, one more thing.”\n“…?”\n“Keep this a secret from Adilun, alright? Surprises always make it more touching.”\n“Of course. Even if I’m a bit clueless, I know that much.”\n“That’s all I needed to hear.”\nExpressing my gratitude to my mother, I returned to my room.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "Chapter 97: Marriage (3)\n[Physis’ POV]\n“What were you talking about?”\n“Ah, my mother gave me some advice about marriage.”\n“I see.”\nWithout much doubt, Adilun nodded. I immediately went straight to bed. Considering how busy we had been with wedding preparations, she must also have been very tired. So on an occasion like this, shouldn’t I express my love as much as possible?\nLove is something to be exchanged between two people. One-sided love can never last long, so one must always be mindful of that.\nLying on the bed, Adilun looked tired. Whether it was from being too busy with work or something else, signs of fatigue were evident. Of course, the eyes looking at me still contained undying affection, but her weariness seemed unavoidable.\n“Are you tired?”\n“...Yes, but it’s manageable.”\n“Then we shouldn’t do any more today.”\n“I think so, too.”\nI climbed onto the bed and, lying down beside her, gently embraced Adilun.\n“Go to sleep if you’re tired.”\n“Mm-hmm.”\nI wasn’t sure if it was the sleepiness seeping through, but she buried her face into my chest. Before long, I felt Adilun’s breathing became more rhythmic. She had fallen asleep.\nIt was only natural, considering we had been so involved in wedding preparations and hadn’t even taken a two-day break from our love making.\nHolding her in my arms, the warmth combined with the scent wafting from her hair gradually calmed my heart.\nUnknowingly, I began to feel drowsy, and sooner than expected, we both drifted into sleep.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nSunlight bathed me. Along with the warmth, I felt softness in my arms.\n“Um...”\nRealizing it was Adilun even without looking, I immediately hugged her and stroked her hair as she gradually snuggled closer into my arms.\nWaking up in the morning to see the sleeping face of the person you love—could anything be more blissful?\nHow long had we been like this?\nBasking in the warmth radiating from Adilun, I held her tightly in my arms and felt her twitch and stir.\n“Physis?”\n“Yes.”\n“Ah, it’s already morning.”\n“Do you feel a bit refreshed?”\n“Yawn... Yes, I feel invigorated. And... I like seeing your face as soon as I wake up.”\nSeeing her tired eyes reluctantly open and her drowsy smile, I couldn’t help but smile back.\n“Shall we get up soon?”\n“Yeah, I’m hungry.”\n“Ah, right. I had plans to briefly go out with my mother today.”\n“With your mother? For what reason?”\n“I’m not exactly sure, but she insisted that we go out together. Judging by the way she said it should just be the two of us, it seems like there’s something on her mind.”\n“Really?”\nA palpable sense of disappointment washed over Adilun’s face. However, I had to deliberately ignore it. A proposal was generally more touching when it remained a secret, wasn’t it?\nIt did sting a bit to lie to her. I might have to apologize for this lie when I eventually propose.\nYet, even with that in mind, the desire to see her surprised and joyful face outweighed the slight guilt I felt. So, I did my best to hide my conflicted feelings.\n“Don’t worry, it won’t take long.”\n“Alright.”\n“I’m sorry for leaving you alone. My mother insisted it should be just the two of us, so there was nothing I could do.”\n“It’s alright. If it’s something my mother-in-law needs, then it can’t be helped. But, you have to be with me until you leave.”\nHer slight smile, doing its best to hide her disappointment, looked so lovely that I pulled her into my arms and planted a kiss.\n“Yess...”\nAs our lips met, I felt a surge of desire. There was still time before I had to leave... once more time wouldn’t hurt. Besides, Adilun seemed pretty invigorated too.\nAs a result, it took us a little extra time to leave the room.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n“What are you doing? Follow me.”\n“Yes, Mother.”\nAfter a light meal, I accompanied my mother to meet a jeweler.\nWe moved toward a shop not far from the mansion, a rather antiquated-looking jewelry store appeared in view.\n“Alright, let’s go in.”\n“Yes.”\nAnd all I could do was repeat, ‘Yes.’\nI had no other choice. What else could I say when that was the only thing I could manage?\nI was nearly clueless about jewelry, so taking the initiative to place a custom order was out of the question.\n“Welcome, I-- Ah, who do we have here? Countess Ortaire, it’s been a long time.”\n“It has, Evan. How have you been?”\n“Excellent. But what brings you here today?”\n“Oh, it’s not me who has business here. It’s my son, here.”\n“Ah. Could it be you, Young Master Physis?”\n“Yes, that’s correct.”\nFor the moment, I simply nodded my head. To be frank, I was quite bewildered.\n“This young man is getting married soon. So, we’re here to get a wedding ring...”\n“I see... A wedding ring, you say.”\nEvan immediately began to pull out various rings from the display case.\n“Is there anything here that catches your eye?”\nHonestly, I couldn’t tell one from the other. My eyes were bombarded with an array of rings, from rather plain ones to dazzling pieces, leaving me utterly incapable of discernment.\nWhat was good or bad, what looked pretty or unimpressive, I had no way of knowing.\nI had never been someone who had much to do with jewels in my lifetime. I spent my childhood brawling and that pattern continued into my adulthood. Even before my regression, it was the same.\nJewels and ornaments never played a significant role in my life.\nBut now, things had to change. No, to be precise, they needed to change from this point on.\nThis was no ordinary trinket, but the most monumental gift I would ever give to the life partner I was to spend my days with—a gift imbued with a vow of lifelong commitment.\nWhile it might seem ludicrous to say that a ring holds a mortgage to people, the story changed when it was a wedding ring.\nOf course, one might argue that there was no need to place too much significance on a mere ring.\nBut I wanted to imbue it with meaning. Had I ever given Adilun any piece of jewelry, even a simple one, before? Not once. Adilun was indeed a woman, and she had considerable interest in her appearance.\nThat interest had only intensified since her transformation. Seeing her indulge in all the adornments she had missed out on brought me genuine joy as well.\nIn any case, this was the first piece of jewelry I’d be giving her. While I’d likely give her more in the future, none would carry as much weight as this wedding ring.\nI had to choose carefully.\nSo, I scrutinized the rings intently. I never imagined that eyes trained to discern the essence of things would be useful in a situation like this.\nI could see even the tiniest flaws in the diamonds, flaws that would go unnoticed by the average person—or even an artisan.\nI felt oddly out of place as I found myself identifying imperfections, however minuscule and seemingly irrelevant they might be.\nAfter a while, my mother intervened.\n“Are you planning to look forever? I think this ring and this one seem fine. This one could be good for an engagement, and this one for the wedding.”\nWhat my mother had selected was one ring with a rather large diamond at the center that looked undeniably luxurious at first glance, and another that seemed relatively plain.\nEven the plain-looking ring was clearly crafted from premium material; it was apparent that no corners had been cut.\nInspecting the two rings my mother had chosen, I couldn’t help but be stunned.\nThey were completely free of the imperfections that had marred the other rings. How she managed to pick these out with just her naked eye was beyond me.\nStill, a question lingered as I examined them, so I asked my mother.\n“An engagement ring and a wedding ring?”\n“Oh, you don’t even know that? Ha...”\nSeeing my mother heaved a sigh, I couldn’t help but tense up. Maybe I should have done some research beforehand.\n“When you propose, you give an engagement ring, and during the wedding, you exchange wedding rings. That’s why you need to pick out two rings. Since your purpose here is to propose, you’ll need to order the engagement ring first. But since we’re already here, let’s also prepare the wedding ring. After all, we owe the Rodenov family because they are giving their precious Adilun to you, haha; it’s only right for us to cover the cost of the rings.”\n“Ah, I see.”\n“Furthermore, because you wear the wedding ring regularly, it usually has a simpler design, whereas the engagement ring is generally more extravagant since it’s only worn on special occasions,” Evan added, supporting my mother’s explanation.\n“Are you satisfied with these rings, then?”\n“...”\n“Physis.”\n“Yes, Mother.”\n“Do you know Adilun’s ring size?”\n“Uh, well, actually...”\n“It’s understandable that you wouldn’t know, but if you’re planning to surprise her, you should have figured it out.”\n“I apologize.”\n“It can’t be helped. For now, try on my finger.”\n“Alright.”\n“How does Adilun’s hand size compare to my ring?”\n“Her hands are slightly smaller than yours.”\n“Good. By how much, exactly?”\n“About one size down, her hands are on the smaller side.”\n“What about the width of her fingers? The wedding ring goes on the inside, and the engagement ring goes on the outside, so you should know both.”\n“Um, I remember it being about this size.”\nRacking my brain, I tried to recall the exact size of Adilun’s fingers, particularly her ring finger on her left hand.\n“This should be about right... Yes, this size seems correct.”\nMy mother skillfully conveyed the size to Evan, who then also measured my finger size. After measuring carefully, Evan nodded as if satisfied, and brought out new rings designed to fit both my finger and Adilun’s.\n“Will this suffice?”\n“Yes, this should be more than enough. How much are they? Physis, you step outside for a bit. It’ll be easier if I handle the remaining procedures.”\nI exited the store and stood still, waiting while my mother made the preparations.\nI couldn’t help but feel that asking for my mother’s assistance was the right decision.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

When should I give it to her? It was not something I could half-heartedly toss out.\nThe atmosphere... they say the atmosphere is crucial... but what exactly is that atmosphere?\nBefore I came back in time, all I knew was how to fight, and even after reincarnating in modern times, it was a period when the world was tilting on its axis—no time to even dream of something like romance.\nSo how could someone like me know what the appropriate atmosphere is for a proposal?\nIt was just eating me up inside.\nBut I couldn’t afford to fret. If I gave it away, Adilun would notice. She was already busy enough with wedding preparations; I couldn’t add more to her plate.\nI should pick a quiet time, go to some nice place... but the problem was, I didn’t really know any good places.\n...I just don’t know.\nI pride myself on being somewhat skilled at other things, but I was utterly inexperienced at this... to the point that I dread my own anxiousness about failing.\nLost in my thoughts and full of frustration, I had no choice but to rack my brain yet again today.\nWhat on earth is the best atmosphere?\n* * *\n[Adilun’s POV]\nLately, Physis seemed a little off. Like he was somewhat restless.\nJust a moment ago, he said he needed to think and stepped outside the room.\nCould it be the wedding that was troubling him? Most likely. I felt the same way.\nMarriage... It was a word that was both sweet and yet tinged with a hint of fear. It was a ceremony that would commit us to walk through life together.\nEven though we had sworn to be with each other, it was true that there was a small lingering fear before the wedding.\nThoughts like, can I really do this well?\nI felt that there was much to prepare for.\nRight after the wedding, I would have to undergo the procedure of officially becoming the lord of Rodenov. Wrapping up my successor classes, preparing to inherit the title of Duke of Rodenov from my father.\nFather had always said that once I got married, I would inherit the lordship of Rodenov.\nAh, it’s all so confusing.\nI wanted to lighten my mood somehow. Just... I wanted to go somewhere expansive, to relish the sense of space itself.\nAh.\nFinally, something came to my mind.\nThe bell tower. Located in Caltix Castle... the bell tower.\nWhenever my heart felt heavy, I would go up there. The scenery I loved the most. There was no better place to lift my spirits.\nMaybe it was time to visit the bell tower again.\nSpurred by the thought, I started walking.\nI opened the door and stepped outside, only to see Physis looking rather restless.\n“Physis?”\n“Ah, Adilun...”\n“You seem troubled lately. Is something bothering you?”\n“Well, it’s just...”\nHe started to say something but then fumbled his words. I couldn’t quite figure out why he was acting this way, and it was starting to frustrate me too.\nMina had said that most people get like this before marriage... but that doesn’t make it any less vexing.\nI wanted to know the reason, but looking at his hesitant expression, I feared it might only strain our emotions. Both of us were already on edge, juggling wedding preparations since returning from Ortaire.\nWe both were trying not to lash out at each other. Unloading our frustrations on each other wouldn’t do either of us any good.\n“If you can’t say it, you don’t have to.”\n“...yes. But where are you going now?”\n“There’s a place I want to go for a bit. Want to come? Maybe it will help ease some of that heaviness.”\nPhysis nodded at my words.\n“Then let’s go.”\nI extended my hand to him, and once he took it, I led him toward the bell tower next to Caltix Castle. It was situated quite high up.\nWe climbed the circular stairs for a good while until finally reaching the top of the tower.\nCreak.\nThe door opened with an old, rusty sound. What followed was the sight of a massive bell.\n“This bell...”\n“You’ve probably heard it too. It rings when night falls over Rodenov, signaling the end of the day.”\n“I see.”\nBeyond the giant bell, something else came into view.\nBelow the bell tower, the entire fortress city of Caltix Castle was laid out before us.\nThe landscape I loved the most. The soul of my homeland, Rodenov, that I always kept in my heart.\nI opened my mouth and began to tell Physis about my favorite view, just as he had once shown me the landscape of Ortaire. Now it was my turn to show him.\n“I love this view.”\n“...”\nPhysis said nothing and simply looked down below the bell tower. The night had already darkened. The interior of Caltix Castle, nestled under the moon and stars, seemed to evoke a particular sentiment just by being seen.\nPeacefulness. Yes, that was what I could call this.\n“I like the winter garden, and sometimes even the snowy landscapes outside the windows. But this view is what I love the most.”\n“Why?”\n“Because from here, you can see the entirety of Caltix Castle.”\n“...”\n“The night when everyone is at rest. The tranquil night sky with the vast expanse of stars above. And below all that, the view of Caltix Castle. And... the wind that sweeps through all of it. Can you feel it, Physis? The wind is about to blow.”\nAs if on cue, a gentle breeze blew through moments later.\nWhoosh.\nThe sound swirling through the empty air was devoid of any extraneous noise.\n“Is it cold? Or refreshing?”\n“Refreshing.”\nI gave a faint smile.\n“Good to hear. If you’d said it was cold, we might have had to relive the past.”\nA smile involuntarily formed at the corners of my mouth.\n“When the wind blows, the bell shakes slightly. Along with that minuscule vibration, there’s the chill you feel the moment the wind hits you. That touch of coldness on my skin reminds me that I’m alive.”\nPhysis didn’t say a word. He seemed to be simply appreciating the scenery, just as I described it. I wondered how he perceived this scenery deep within his heart.\nI didn’t know, but... I hoped he loved this view. If I could be greedy for just a moment, I wished this could be his most cherished scenery as well.\n“In the moments when the wind makes me aware of my own life, I look at the landscape before me. A night where everyone has fallen into rest. Isn’t it peaceful? A scene filled only with the sound of the wind?”\n“...”\n“When the wind ceases, only then do I look up at the sky. When the howling wind stops, it’s the quietest time. And when I look at the stars in that moment, it feels as if countless shining stars are blessing me.”\n“...”\n“That’s why I love this view the most. Because it feels like the very fact that I was born is a blessing. What about you?”\n“I’m a brute and ignorant, so I don’t really know. Before my regression and after, all I knew was fighting. I might have been quite dry to feel something while watching this kind of scenery. The reason I feel something in Ortaire’s landscape comes from the nostalgia of my childhood.”\n“...”\nThen, he opened his mouth again and continued his words.\n“But one thing’s for sure. This scenery... will probably become my most cherished.”\nWhy did his words make me so happy?\nI grabbed Physis’ hand and led him to sit on the railing of the steeple. Neither of us mentioned the risk; we just felt the wind.\nA sigh escaped me in the biting cold wind. But that sigh scattered in the wind and disappeared, soon after which his hand grabbed mine.\nThat sliver of warmth. The belief that he would be by my side forever blew away all the worries I had ever felt.\n“If you have any worries, tell me now. I’ve just... let go of my own.”\n“What worries?”\n“Fears about the future. Will I be able to make it? Can I dream of a wonderful future with you? These worries have gathered and become fear. Women usually get anxious before marriage, you know. It’s not that I’ve lost faith in you, but this fear just came to me. Did you feel the same Physis?”\n“...I did.”\n“Then tell me. You’ve been a little off lately. Is there something you’re worried about? I told you not to say it earlier, but... I actually want to hear what’s on your mind.”\nHe didn’t respond, lost deep in thought.\n“Adilun. Wait?”\nThen, he seemed to make a decision, his eyes were shining... as he took my hand.\n“Um, why?”\n“I have something I really want to say.”\nWhat was it? At that moment, I felt a surge of anticipation. What could he possibly say?\nHe led me in front of a massive bell. Then, at a spot where the whole of the Caltix Castle could be seen below us... he took something out of his pocket.\nSmall and square, yet, an exquisite box.\nI knew instinctively what it was.\nHe opened the box. What was revealed were a pair of delicately crafted diamond rings.\nAh, so that’s what he’s been worried about. That’s why he’s been so restless.\nI couldn’t say anything. A whirlpool of emotions overflowed within me.\n“As I said earlier... I’m a brute and ignorant, so there’s a lot I don’t know. But at least this much, I think I can say.”\n“What are you saying?”\n“I want to protect this view that you hold so dear.”\nHe got down on one knee.\n“I have no grand or touching words that come to mind, but there’s something I absolutely want to say to you.”\n“...”\n“I want to walk through life with you. So... Adilun.”\n“...”\n“Marry me.”\n“I’ve bound you with my words. And you’ve done the same. Isn’t that so, Physis?”\nWhat spilled from my mouth were jumbled words.\n“You may call yourself a brute or ignorant, but you were never either of them. You’re more remarkable than anyone else.”\nA tear slipped down my cheek, compelled by overwhelming emotion.\n“So... yes. I’ll walk through life with you. My love.”\nI extended my hand toward him. He slipped the ring onto my left ring finger, and at last, the vow binding us was complete.\nThe worry that had settled deep within me evaporated completely.\nAh, it was such a trivial worry.\nIf we continue to move forward, respecting each other... eventually, we’ll reach the end.\nI was so overwhelmingly happy that, as he rose to embrace me, I couldn’t help but cry for a long while.\nThrough twists and turns, and a long winding journey... we’ve finally arrived at this moment.\nHow could I possibly say I’m not happy?\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[TL: Join Patreon to\nsupport the translation and to read ahead of the release\n: https://www.patreon.com/taylor007 ]",

      "content": "Chapter 99: Marriage (Complete)\nEmbracing Adilun in my arms, I realized she was crying.\nI couldn’t tell her not to cry. She must be crying out of happiness. And... I too felt a wave of emotion swelling up within me.\nYes. Finally, we were at the starting line of a new life.\nA relationship where we face each other, walk together at times, and perhaps fight occasionally, but always reconcile based on a foundation of steadfast trust. That was where we were starting.\nWith this thought, I gently released Adilun from my embrace and looked at her face.\nHer eyes tinged with a hint of red looked beautiful to me, as if I was gazing at a sky strewn with stars.\nIn the end, I couldn’t resist and stole a kiss from her lips. Despite having longed for them countless times, how could they make me this happy?\nThump. Thump.\nAnd simultaneously, the sound of Adilun’s heartbeat resounded.\nThis wasn’t the steady heartbeat of Adilun that I was used to; it was slightly erratic. It was the first time I had ever heard her heart sound so loud.\nWondering what was happening, I looked at Adilun, and the focus disappeared from her eyes.\n“...Adilun?”\nThump. Thump. Thump.\nThe heartbeat began to intensify. I didn’t know the details, but something was about to happen.\nSuddenly, with dazed eyes, she turned toward the balustrade of the bell tower. I grabbed Adilun and called out to her again.\n“Adilun!”\nWhat on Earth was happening? Filled with concern, I embraced her from behind.\nBut the thing I feared did not happen. She was simply looking up at the sky. Her still thundering heartbeat lingered in my ears.\nWhat’s going on?\nWhat exactly is happening right now?\nStars circled around her as she looked up at the sky. No, it was more like a galaxy descending, as light came down from above.\n“What...?”\nContrary to my bewildered tone, Adilun’s expression was serene.\nThe starlight descended and rested on her shoulders.\nWhoosh!\nSuddenly, wings unfurled. These weren’t wings made of feathers but seemed to be created from ice crystals and light intermingling.\nTransparent yet emitting a frigid aura, those wings spread wide from her shoulders, and then Adilun seemed to regain consciousness.\n“...Huh?”\n“Adilun?”\nAt my call, she looked at me as if just realizing she had momentarily lost consciousness.\n“Physis? Uh, why am I here...?”\n“You lost consciousness for a moment and started walking outside on your own.”\n“Ah.”\n“And then light poured down from the sky, and wings sprouted.”\n“Wings...”\nUpon hearing my words, she began to touch her shoulders, where her wings had sprouted. Soon, she seemed to realize something and spread her wings before speaking.\n“These are... dragon wings. I’d only read about them in ancient texts; I never knew I could actually have wings.”\n“How did this happen?”\n“It’s because of the covenant we made.”\n“Covenant?”\n“Yes. A lifelong covenant. Dragon wings are the final stage of awakening, following the manifestation of a spiritual core. It’s the stage that our ancestor dragon Altair reached. Physis.”\n“Huh?”\n“Could you... give me a moment?”\n“I don’t know what’s going on, but alright.”\nAs soon as I agreed, she clasped her hands together and folded her wings around me.\nIt looked as if she instinctively knew what to do, even though she’d only just spread her wings moments ago.\nThe slightly translucent wings, which had previously exuded a chilly aura, now warmly enveloped me.\nWhat on earth was happening?\nI was puzzled, but it didn’t seem to be something harmful, so I quietly waited for her next move. Then I began to hear the steady heartbeat of Adilun once again.\nThen, Adilun’s mouth opened.\nIt wasn’t words. Sounds that couldn’t be described as language began to emanate from her lips.\nAs those sounds merged, I began to feel something settling into my body. The part of her wing that had enveloped me seemed to be seeping into me.\nThen, a burning pain appeared in my chest, and I grimaced for a moment. But the pain was fleeting. Curious, I touched the center of my chest.\nThis sensation. It was something I’d felt before—Adilun’s spiritual core, or ‘core essence,’ inside her chest. It felt the same.\n“A core essence?”\n“Probably so.”\n“Why do I have a core essence now?”\n“It’s a sign that you are a dragon’s companion. From now on... we will share our lives.”\n“What do you mean by lives?”\n“Lifespan. When my life ends, so will yours.”\n“So, my lifespan has increased?”\n“Yes. I could feel it when I spread my wings. I have a long life ahead of me, transcending the limitations of being human. Maybe hundreds, perhaps even a thousand years.”\n“How is that even possible? I’m just... a normal human.”\n“When a dragon forms a covenant, they can grant a single wish. So, I wished to share the remaining half of my life with you. That you could live with me until the end of my life.”\nFor a moment, her expression darkened.\n“This is my selfishness. Having an abnormally long life might be a curse rather than a blessing. Even so, I... I wished for it. Because I can’t imagine a life without you now. Can you forgive this selfish me?”\n“Absolutely.”\nI answered immediately. Yes, the days ahead may be fraught with challenges, but if I could walk through them with someone I love more than anyone else, I could bear it.\nWith that, I embraced her tightly.\nHow many times had I hugged her? Yet each time I did, I felt a deep sense of fulfillment, confirming how much I truly loved her.\n“Thank you. And... I love you.”\nAt the end, what came out was a cliché. But clichés were clichés because they hit home.\n“I love you too.‘”\nThat was the only answer I could give.\n* * *\nIt was a bright day.\nA day when just walking around was uplifting.\nA grand festival was taking place in Rodenov. The heart of Rodenov, the castle city of Caltix, clearly came into view for both Lobelia and Aristata.\n“It’s your first time here too. Isn’t it, Aristata?”\n“Yes, it is.”\n“Speaking of which, a wedding. Somehow, it makes me envious.”\n“I feel the same way. The two of them seemed to get along quite well during the last National Foundation Day, and now, here they are.”\n“What about your fiancé?”\n“...Asphodel, you know how it is.”\n“...Right.”\nLobelia averted her eyes, changing the subject.\n“Come to think of it, I’d like to see Adilun first.”\n“Me too. I heard that her scales have disappeared, so I wonder how she looks now.”\n“I heard she is incredibly beautiful?”\n“Must be. After all, even Duke Johannes and Duchess Claudia are known for their beauty.”\n“Well... we’ll find out when we see her.”\nThe two looked oddly comfortable with each other.\n“Ah, is it over there?”\n“It’s my first time seeing it, but it looks like something straight out of a story.”\nLobelia admired the Caltix castle.\n“Says the person who looks like she leaped right out of a storybook.”\n“Haha, is that so?”\n“Yes, it is. Let’s not make a fuss, we’re here for a reason.”\n“Right, right.”\nThe two entered Caltix Castle without incident. As soon as Princess Lobelia and the Aristata Glosuna made their appearance, a commotion broke out within the castle walls.\nEven though they had sent an invitation, no one expected the two to arrive unaccompanied.\nOf course, this was of little consequence to the two women.\nThey began to discuss whom they should visit first.\n“Who shall we meet first?”\n“Of course bride.”\n“Alright, let’s go.”\nThey walked towards the bride’s waiting room.\nThe sound of bustling activity reached their ears. Adilun was engrossed in getting ready, seemingly in the thick of her preparations.\nLobelia and Aristata felt their hearts flutter inexplicably at the sight.\nThe pure white dress that flowed down to her toes, coupled with the saying that a woman looks her most beautiful at her wedding, left no room for disagreement.\nAdilun was stunning. There was no other way to describe her.\nHer dark blue hair cascaded down her back, and atop her head were bluish-white horns that seemed to flaunt her extraordinary nature.\nEqually ostentatious was the diamond ring on her left ring finger. Clearly a masterful piece of craftsmanship, soon to be replaced by a wedding ring, no doubt.\nSensing their presence, Adilun turned her head slightly.\nEven seeing just her back, her beauty was evident, but a frontal view was simply overwhelming. Lobelia and Aristata, who had never felt inferior to anyone based on looks, found themselves utterly eclipsed by her.\nHer eyes were a gold color that held a subtle tension, and her cheeks and jawline were still tinged with pale blue scales. The remaining scales, like the horns on her head, only added to her mystique.\n“Hello.”\nAdilun greeted them with a relaxed attitude. The two hurriedly reciprocated.\n“Ah, hello. It’s been a while, Adilun.”\n“It has been. Your Highness. And to you, Princess Glosuna.”\n“Thank you for inviting me, Princess Rodenov.”\n“You’re welcome.”\nAristata wanted to know why she was invited and why Adilun was looking at her with such an expression.\nIt was as if she was seeing a dear friend after a long time.\n“Congratulations on your wedding. That’s the first thing we should say, right?”\n“Thank you, Your Highness.”\n“There’s a lot I want to ask, but the ceremony is about to begin, so we’ll save that for later.”\n“I look forward to it. Please, enjoy yourselves. This is a wedding prepared by Rodenov’s most skillful people, so there’s plenty to see.”\n“Yes.”\nThe two of them nodded and left the bride’s waiting room. A strange sense of awe enveloped them.\n“Whew. There’s a subtle intensity in the air.”\n“Indeed. And for some reason, I can’t quite grasp why she looked at us so warmly.”\n“Right.”\nBoth wore enigmatic expressions as they shook their heads.\n***\nIn the groom’s waiting room, Physis had finished dressing and sat there with a slightly tensed look. His gaze was focused on the door.\n“How’s Adilun?”\n“She’s all set. It’s time to move.”\nSara, the head maid and Adilun’s aide, replied.\nNodding, Physis stepped out of the room and headed for the wedding hall.\nAs the announcer proclaimed the groom’s entrance, the doors opened, revealing Physis in his pristine white tuxedo.\nThe hall was filled with people—knights from both Rodenov and Ortaire, and family members.\nPeople invited from all corners of the empire filled the room.\nThe red carpet laid on the floor signaled the path leading to marriage. Physis moved a little stiffly, his nerves not yet fully relaxed.\nHow long had he waited? Just as Physis had stiffened up completely,\n“The bride is entering!”\nThe moment he’d been waiting for had arrived. Adilun slowly approached, holding the hand of Duke Johannes.\nShe looked more beautiful than ever, draped in pure white, her veil gently fluttering down. Her slightly visible face beneath the veil was utterly charming.\nHe could have easily exclaimed in admiration, but Physis restrained himself. It was a sacred ceremony, after all.\nAs they reached the halfway point, Physis turned and stepped forward to meet them. Then, Duke Johannes released Adilun’s hand.\n“Congratulations.”\n“Thank you.”\n“Take good care of my daughter. As you know... if she shows even a hint of her old self, you’ll have to answer to me.”\n“I’ll keep that in mind.”\nAt Duke Johannes’ half-joking, half-serious comment, Physis gave an awkward smile. His stiffness began to ease.\n“Let’s go, Adilun.”\n“...Yes.”\nPhysis took Adilun’s hand, and together they proceeded to the center of the hall.\nPresiding over the ceremony was the High Priest of the Vitala Church, Narcissus. Though she should have been in Enasa, she had come at Princess Lobelia’s request and graciously agreed to officiate the wedding.\nIt seemed to be because she’d heard the tale of how they had repelled the Demon King and saved many lives.\nNarcissus began to speak.\nThe traditional wedding vows commenced. Words of gratitude for being invited to such a joyous occasion on such a wonderful day were spoken.\nWords flow from Narcissus’ mouth, and the formal wedding ceremony begins.\n“Groom, do you vow to cherish the bride for the rest of your life and to place your trust in her?”\n“I vow.”\nPhysis spoke, a resolute promise emanating from his lips.\n“Bride, do you vow to stand by the groom’s side and trust in each other for the rest of your life?”\n“I vow.”\nAdilun’s lips parted, her eyes, which had been slightly quivering, finally steady.\n“With prayers for a bright future, filled with mutual respect, elevation, and trust, I hereby declare that you are now husband and wife.”\nAs Narcissus finished her declaration, Physis gently removed the engagement ring from Adilun’s left ring finger and replaced it with the prepared wedding ring. Adilun followed suit, completing the same ritual.\n“Finally, there will be an oath kiss.”\nNarcissus’ voice came through, tinged with a hint of excitement.\nThe two looked into each other’s eyes. What filled their gaze was trust and affection. Their emotions were so palpable that everyone in the hall could sense them.\nThe eyes of the surrounding crowd softened, and smiles formed on their lips.\nPhysis lifted the veil from Adilun’s head and placed his lips upon hers.\nNext, the sound of applause reverberated throughout the hall.\nMany challenges had been faced, and many more were to come.\nTheir future won’t be entirely bright, nor will it be entirely dark.\nBut they would overcome.\nTwo people who once despised each other to the point of wishing death had finally reached a blissful marriage, wrapped in affection and trust for one another.\nEndless time stretches ahead. No one knew what the future holds, but at least these two know one thing.\nNo matter what happens, the two of them will be happy.\nPerhaps, forever.\nI became the fiancée of the dragon in the Romance Fantasy- completed.\n--- End OF The Chapter ---\n[ TL: Hey, everyone!
