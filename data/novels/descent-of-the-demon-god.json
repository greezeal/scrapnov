      "content": "My name, Chun Yeowun.\nThe twenty-fourth lord of the Sky Demon Order.\nThe title could be a bit exaggerated, but in Murim, I am called the Demon God.\nTo reach this point, I had to go through an extraordinary process of growth.\nThere’s a secret that the members of the Sky Demon Order or the other people of Murim don’t know.\nIt was the Nano Machine.\nWith the help of ’Nano’, the 7th generation and strongest Nano Machine injected into my body by my descendant from the future, I managed to become stronger at an unimaginable pace and created organizations which slowly ruled over the Cult and then became the Lord of the Sky Demon Order.\nI was told that there are multiple time axes in the world.\nOf course, there’s no way I would know about the other time axes apart from the one I lived in.\nThere’s a reason why I chose to say this.\ns\nThe descendant from the distant future knows of the ‘Blade God’ who possibly has a connection to a large conglomerate called the Blade Six, or in my time, it was called the Blade God Six Martial Clan, which is rumored to control the future.\nHowever, there was a hidden secret to that fact.\nThis Blade God is known to be the strongest immortal, a person who traveled from the future to the past just like my descendant, and he’s the one who changed the past by twisting the actual time axis.\nMy descendant came to the past to correct that warped time.\nThe Blade God, who was unaware of the existence of another time traveler, started to be cautious of my rapid growth and tried to get rid of me, which failed.\nIt was because I was beyond what he could handle and reached the Heavenly Master Level along with Nano by my side.\nI wanted to chase after my ambition to unify the entire Murim after eliminating the Blade God and create an era of the Sky Demon Order, once again.\nBut, things never go as planned.\nAn UN-affiliated armed group, which called themselves the Time Patrol or TP, which regulated time travel, noticed the existence of my descendant and then tried to retrieve the Nano Machine from my body.\nNormally, they had the technology to track down the Nano Machine.\nHowever, the Nano Machine in my body is a technology made by the future Sky Demon Order, the Sky Corporation. It’s the 7th generation Nano Machine which is made of the strongest metal known as Gatelinium.\nThe Time Patrol accidentally noticed it while they were pursuing my descendant Chun Mu-seong.\nThey tried various means to catch me, and when it became difficult for them, they brought in their Special Forces who were experienced.\nI tried to stop them from pursuing anymore by annihilating the squad and making it look like my descendant was dead due to the pursuit.\nAnd there came the variable in my plan.\nThe Blade God popped up and tried to take over the Time Jet, the time-traveling aircraft the TP used.\nHe, who realized that my current self couldn’t be taken down by him, decided to go to the past.\nDue to that, I had to board the Time Jet and stop him. I managed to eliminate the Blade God.\nBut that was where the real problem arose.\nThe only surviving Time Jet pilot broke the main board of the jet.\nChun Yeowun ran to the cockpit.\n‘Nano. Can you hack this and get me out of here safely.’\n[There is damage to the main board, so it may be difficult to adjust with hacking.]\n‘You have to do something. Or we’ll both die.’\n[Will try hacking. Please place your palm on the cockpit board.]\n‘Okay!’\nChun Yeowun hastily placed his right palm on the board.\nThe glove of the Nano Suit was on his right hand, and a line of light came out of it and penetrated into the broken board.\n[Entering the backup system.]\nJjakkk!\nAlong with Nano’s voice, Chun Yeowun’s ears could pick up the ice cracking.\nIt could be dangerous if he didn’t hurry.\nHe was waiting with impatient eyes when the LED lights of the Time Jet, which had flickered continuously, came on.\nWhoong! Beep! Beep!\nAt the same time, the buttons on the main board of the cockpit also lit up.\nSome didn’t come on, but it seemed like everything was working normally.\n‘Nano? Done?’\n[It seems that the coordinate setting device has been damaged, so we will have to crash land out of the space and time flow.]\n‘What are you saying?’\n[Means to land in a different space and time than the user’s.]\nChun Yeowun’s face hardened.\nAs Nano said that, it meant that he could enter a time that he had no idea about.\nJjkkk!\nThe sound of cracking ice could be heard.\nThey were out of time.\nAt this rate, the jet would break apart.\n‘Mun Ku.’\nAt that moment, in Chun Yeowun’s mind, he saw an image of Mun Ku with a child.\nIf he died, he would never get to see them again.\nBiting his lip, Chun Yeowun determined, ordered Nano.\n“Go ahead!”\n[Yes. Escaping the flow of space and time.]\nGoo!\nAs soon as Nano finished speaking, The Time Jet shook.\nThe space flow was made up of five different colored lines that could be seen through the front glass of the cockpit. For a second, the Time Jet escaped.\nRumble!\nStrong pressure rose, just like it did when the jet entered the flow.\n“Kuak!”\nChun Yeowun grabbed the handle on the cockpit board and held onto it.\nIf he let go of the main board, the connection Nano had with the jet would break.\nClank! Clank!\nHe tried not to move as much as possible, and the space outside the window made of five colors changed.\nIt was then.\nJjjkkk!\nThey exited the flow, and the ice broke.\nAt the same time, Chun Yeowun’s body, which was holding the board, was sucked out of the jet with tremendous force.\nPang!\n“Uakk!”\n[Opening Gatelinium Nano Suit!]\nChachacha!\nThe Nano Suit opened up around Chun Yeowun’s body.\nHe didn’t even realize that the suit had unfolded, but the suit seemed red.\nAnd in some parts, it was a mixture of blue.\n‘Where am I?’\n[In the mesosphere at an altitude of 60km.]\nHigher than the stratosphere.\nThe same area that the Time Jet had to be to enter the space and time flow.\n‘Air?’\nHe decided to go back to the Time Jet.\nHowever, the Time Jet, which was becoming small as he was moving down, exploded.\nBang!\n‘This!’\nIf Chun Yeowun was a little late, he would have died in the explosion.\nHe had no choice but to go down now.\n‘Nano, flight mode.’\n[Switching to flight mode.]\nChun Yeowun’s body quickly moved towards land.\nThe outer part of the Nano Suit, which was dyed red, slowly returned to its original color as he got closer to land.\nSwoosh!\nHow long was it?\nChun Yeowun could finally see land.\nHowever, it wasn’t the land of Jianghu which was full of greenery.\n[Altitude 15km.]\n[Altitude 14.5km.]\n[Altitude 13km.]\nAs he descended, he saw large buildings.\n‘What... the hell?’\nThere were grasses and mountains around.\nThere were trees, but it was more like a grey world.\nBuildings which had square roofs, and not tiled houses, Chun Yeowun’s body was getting close to the ground.\nEventually,\n[Altitude 300m.]\nUpon entering that point, Chun Yeowun descended onto a huge building.\nChun Yeowun’s eyes widened at the transparent walls the building had.\nHe was moving quickly, but he could see a lot of people inside the transparent walls.\n[Will land soon, altitude of 100m.]\nThud!\nChun Yeowun’s body soon landed on the dark grey ground.\nHe stood up, straightening himself.\nChachacha!\nThe helmet of the Nano Suit lifted up as he saw the new world, which was surrounded by buildings.\nThis wasn’t the world he knew.\nWoong!\n“A-A man fell from above!”\n“It looked like he fell from the building?”\n“Now! A superhero landing? Are they filming for the Man of Steel?”\ns\nPeople in clothes which he had never seen before were looking at Chun Yeowun, who was equally shocked.\nHe was wary of their sudden appearance.\n‘Where is this?’\nAs he looked around with confused eyes, Nano answered him.\n[Detected Wi-Fi signal. The age of the coordinates is... AD. Year. 2069.02.19]",

      "content": "Tok! Tok! Tok!\nContrary to his handsome appearance, a man in his mid-thirties with thick dark circles under his eyes was frantically typing something.\nIt looked different, a smartphone that was transparent like glass.\nSomething could be heard through the ear of the man who seemed to be talking with someone as his lips moved.\n[Mr. Lee Myeong. Autonomous driving mode has been canceled due to vehicle congestion time. Please place both your hands on the wheel.]\nThe words of the AI in the vehicle he was driving.\n“Tch, what generation are we in? Shouldn’t there be an autonomous mode just for driving in rush hour!”\nThe man groaned.\nAutonomous driving mode for automobiles has been commercialized since 2026.\nSeveral makers had ambitiously introduced their self-driving cars with approval from the government, but no matter what car, accidents couldn’t be prevented.\ns\nDespite numerous sensors being installed into the vehicle and the development of sophisticated vehicle AI, the autonomous driving mode couldn’t respond smoothly to congestion or sudden unexpected situations.\nAfter numerous accidents, the government decided to put restrictions on the autonomous driving mode.\nSrrr!\nLee Myeong closed the transparent smartphone on his left wrist.\nAnd what was supposed to be a phone wrapped itself around his wrist.\n“Sigh.”\nAs the flexible transparent smartphone device wrapped itself around like a watch, Lee Myeong sighed as he grabbed the steering wheel.\nHe tried to get to the Shenyang City Public Security Bureau (City-level Chinese Nation Police Agency) as early as possible. Still, it was his fault for the delay at the Academy of Sciences.\nIt was rush hour, so there were a lot of cars on the road.\n“I need to hurry. The director is going to nag at me.”\nThe director is the head of the Public Security Bureau.\nDespite his boss not being in front of him, the thought alone scared him.\nStep!\nWith strength on his right foot, he stepped on the gas.\nFive o’clock in the afternoon.\nAlthough it was February, the sky was already turning yellow with all the cold around them.\nWith that, the sun went down.\nPassing through the forest of buildings and moving above the overpass, which was above the small buildings, he saw a huge wall to the west.\nA gray wall, full of repair marks here and there, surrounded the entire city.\nThe wall is known to be the Gate Barrier.\n“Ah, this is so frustrating.”\nEvery time Lee Myeong looked at the wall, his heart would ache.\nThat gigantic barrier was the evidence that made him and the other people realize just how insignificant and helpless humans are in the current world.\n“It has been twenty-eight years already.”\nTwenty-eight years have passed since the First Dimensional Gate, which was called the worst day in human history, opened.\nThat year was the worst year in history, where one-fifth of the world’s population was erased.\nIn fact, humanity could have suffered more damage.\nHowever, as forces hidden behind mankind appeared like the sun, the damage was kept to a minimum.\nShh! Tak!\nHe took out a pack of menthol cigarettes from his pocket and put one between his lips.\nHe was about to light it when the AI’s voice warned him.\n-Business vehicles are non-smoking areas. Warnings or penalties may be given at a later date.\n“Fuck.”\nIt was annoying to hear that warning every time he lit a cigarette.\nAs it was a work vehicle from the Public Security Bureau, it wasn’t possible to mute the vehicle’s AI.\nCrackle!\nHe lit the cigarette with the lighter, sucking in a huge amount of smoke to fill his lungs, and then exhaled the smoke.\n“Phew!”\nThe inside of the car was instantly filled with smoke.\nWheeing!\nThe sunroof of the car opened by itself.\nThe smoke in the car leaked out through the open sunroof.\nBeep! Beep!\n“Shut up.”\nLee Myeong relaxed his right foot and lowered the speed.\nAlthough he was moving at 80km/h, the wind noise coming through the sunroof hurt his ears.\nIt was then.\nBe-beep! Be-beep!\nThe smartphone on his wrist began to ring.\nAnd the face of a woman in her early sixties with sparse white hair could be seen on the car’s center screen.\n“What?”\nThe caller was none other than his mother.\n“It isn’t time for work yet.”\nWondering what was going on, he decided to connect the call via Bluetooth.\n“Hello.”\n-My son.\n“I’m still at work.”\n-You think your mother doesn’t know that?\n“Then what’s up? If it’s nothing important, the call will get cut off as soon as I get close to the Public Security Bureau.”\n-You. You’ve been working there for so long. Why can’t you just use a messenger?\n“What are you talking about?”\nLee Myeong looked annoyed.\nSo was his mother, when she said.\n-I let you live however you want to. Shouldn’t you at least do one thing that your mother asks? Stop by Beijing for a while and have a meal with Director Zhang’s third daughter...\n“Can’t. You know this is how my job works, right?”\n-...Do you plan on avoiding it every time like this?\n“Whatever, I might not make it past the wall with the Gate 26 warning.”\n-Warning?\n“Soon, there will be news and alarms in each province.”\n-.....\nUpon hearing that, Lee Myeong’s mother was speechless.\nGate Warning.\nIt was a warning issued to citizens in places where the Gates open.\nSince one could never know what would happen once a Gate is opened.\n-The cycle is short. It’s Gate 26... he might be summoned. Haha.\n“I’m near the Public Security Bureau. Ending the call.”\n-... I believe what you are saying about the Bureau, but I hope you don’t fight your mother who arranged for you to meet ‘that one’ with that excuse.\n“Yes, yes~!”\nHoping that she would give up, Lee Myeong answered with a smile.\nBut,\n-Director Zhang worked hard to persuade her, so go to Beijing once the warning is cleared. Get the phone number and the messenger ID, and make an appointment.\n“Ha!”\nHis face crumbled in an instant.\nHe definitely said that he didn’t want to have a conversation on the messenger, but there she goes talking about it again.\nHe was at a loss for words when she said that.\n-Don’t you remember where you came from?\nHis mother ruled over him.\n-Listen to your mother. You’re 36. How long do you plan on spending your life in vain as a single man? I’m only thinking of...\n“Haa”\nAt her constant nagging, the man deeply inhaled the half-burned cigarette.\n‘For me?’\nNot at all.\nHe was a child who moved away from his home.\nIf he wanted to marry, he would have gotten married when he was seeing women.\n‘What’s this? Some clan union... shit!’\nAlthough he had a rough mouth, he couldn’t get himself to curse in front of his mother.\nStill, he was upset.\n-Anyway, listen to this mother of yours. I won’t sit still if this doesn’t work. If it doesn’t work out this time either... sigh, it would have been nice to freely buy a plane ticket and travel by air like before. What kind of a mess are we in!\n“I’ve heard you talk about planes a hundred times already.”\nAirplanes.\nThey were now a symbol of the past.\nHis mother told him that it was possible to travel from one place to another by plane when she was young.\nHowever, from the moment that the Gates opened, movement by air became impossible.\nThanks to that, Lee Myeong had never seen a plane.\nHis mother said that he had flown on an airplane when he was three years old, but who even remembers that?\n-You always treat your mother as some old-timey person. All because you don’t know how convenient an airplane is!\n“Yes, yes, yes. Right. If you can move by the sky, yes, yes. The days when humans ruled the skies are long gone...”\nFor a moment, Lee Myeong stopped talking.\nHe doubted his eyes.\nSomething just fell from the skyscrapers.\n‘What was that?’\nIt was so far away that he couldn’t see it clearly, but ‘something’ fell from the sky.\n-What are you talk... chick!\nThe phone was disconnected, and a Public Security mark appeared on the center screen.\nAnd he heard the familiar voice of a member of the Information and Communication Team of the Public Security Bureau.\n-This is the Information and Communication Team of the Public Security Bureau. An unidentified flying object just fell in the middle of 2nd Avenue in Tie Xi Qu.\n“Flying object?”\nThe road he was driving on was 5th Avenue.\nVery close.\nThen, the information was about what he saw.\nIf a flying object fell from the sky, then it could or couldn’t have something to do with the Gates.\n-Public Security police and members near 2nd Avenue must stay armed while grasping the situation.\nMaybe he wasn’t out of luck.\nIt was all happening on his way.\n“Damn it, the Gate alarm wasn’t even sounded, yet what is all this?”\nGrunting, he pressed the red and blue button on the top of the center panel.\nAnd then a siren came up from the left side of the white RV he was driving.\nWee-woo! Wee-woo!\nThe siren sounded, and he turned the steering wheel sideways.\nThere was only one good thing that came from sounding the siren officially.\nDespite the road being congested, he would get a free pass to move.\nLee Myeong spoke as he pressed the speaker button on the center car panel.\n“This is Lee Myeong, the 3rd team leader of the Shenyang City Public Security Bureau. On my way to 2nd Avenue.”\n-Understood.\nAs soon as he heard that, he released his finger from the speaker button and stepped on the gas towards the road where cars began to divide like the red sea.\nHe wasn’t too far from 2nd Avenue.\nAnd it was clear where this unidentified object had fallen.\nWoong!\nThe place where people gathered.\nThere were three Public Security Police Vehicles that arrived.\nTak!\nLee Myeong got out of the RV and took out his ID as he looked at the crowd.\n‘All this curiosity.’\nIt could be dangerous if this was related to the Gate. However, it was strange how people gathered.\nIf what fell was a level 5 dangerous object from the Gate, everyone who gathered could be in life-threatening danger.\nNot a single person there could protect the ordinary civilians.\n‘Crazy bastards. Get bit for gathering. What the hell are they doing?’\nIrritated, Lee Myeong shouted at the people.\n“Public Security. Step away! Step away!”\nWoong!\nHowever, despite the shout, not a single person stepped back, and they were all concentrating on the mysterious thing.\nWith their phones in their hands, not a single person could take a video.\n‘Was a video jammer used?’\nThe current world is a world of web media.\nAnyone could take photos or videos with their phones, which was why the government and the Public Security Bureau took special measures to create a signal interference when it came to such situations.\nAnd the phones which were exposed to the jammers would automatically delete the already recorded content at that very moment.\nClick!\nThe phone on his wrist was shut down too.\nIt was an impossible task for the union’s local government, but it was possible for the great China’s government, the People’s Republic of China.\nThanks to that, it was possible to avoid the spread of information.\n‘Nothing can be done when it’s this crowded.’\nIt seemed challenging to cut through the large crowd, and he would have to wait until the Security Taskforce came.\n‘But I can’t stay still when such a dangerous object is lying around.’\nIf this object was dangerous, people would have to evacuate before something broke out.\nLee Myeong rushed through the crowd and entered the mostly empty space.\nTo check with his own eyes what the people were staring at...\n‘Eh?!’\nLee, who was very nervous, was disappointed.\nAnd then mumbled.\n“What’s this? What’s with the outfit?”\nA young man with long black hair and a freakishly handsome face with pale skin.\nHe was wearing a black robe, more like a dark cloak which one would see in historical dramas, and his appearance, well, the man didn’t seem freaked out about the people around him.\n‘Are they filming a historical drama?’\nIt was funny just how nervous he was thinking that the object would harm people.\nThere was no unidentified flying object apart from the man who looked like he came from a different era.\nClick!\nOne of the four police officers in indigo uniforms, who were aiming their guns at the young man, pulled handcuffs from his wait.\nThere were police officers nearby.\nTwo of them cautiously approached the old-fashioned young man.\nAs a response, Lee Myeong approached the two police officers who were aiming their guns at the young man and showed his police ID.\nThe officers slightly bowed, not lowering their guns from the unknown man.\nIt was because Lee Myeong was of higher rank.\n“I’m Lee Myeong, the 3rd team leader of the Shenyang Public Security Bureau’s violent crimes squad. It was reported that an unidentified object has fallen here. So, why are you aiming your guns at an unarmed citizen?”\nHe couldn’t understand it, sure, the man was dressed weirdly, but it was strange how they were aiming their guns at an innocent citizen.\nAt that, one officer said.\n“Inspector. This is it.”\n“It?”\n“The unidentified flying object which fell from the sky is this old-fashioned man!”\n“What bullshit...”\nIt was then.\nBefore he could even yell, something unexpected happened.\nPuck!\n“Kuak!”\nOne of the officers who approached the young man in old-fashioned clothes to place him in handcuffs fell down as if he was in some action scene in a sitcom.\nThud!\n“Kuak!”\nHe seemed to be in too much pain to get back up.\n“Shit!”\nAnother officer tried to cuff the man’s arms, but his wrist was caught.\nTak!\n“Huh?”\nCrack!\nBoth his eyes went wide at the sound of bones cracking.\n“Kuaaak! My hand!”\nThe officer’s right arm, which was trying to cuff the young man, was bizarrely twisted.\nThe arm wouldn’t bend properly, straighten properly, and the bone, the bone protruded through the elbow.\n“Kyaaak!”\n“Hiik!”\ns\n“Th-The bone is sticking out of his elbow!\nEven the citizens who were all watching him screamed nervously at what they saw.\n“What shit is this?”\nChak!\nLee Myeong, who was yelling at the officers for aiming their guns at the innocent citizen, pulled out his gun and aimed it at the young man.",

      "content": "A young man with long hair, staring at his surroundings with eyes sharp like a sword.\nIt seemed like he was walking through a different era.\nHe was the twenty-fourth Lord of the Sky Demon Order, Chun Yeowun, who was called the Demon God in Jianghu.\nChun Yeowun had a calm personality, but he was quite sensitive.\n‘This is... future?’\nFrom the words of Nano, the Nano Machine in him, this place was definitely the future.\nEverything was flustering.\nThe tall buildings built with concrete, and the asphalt roads below his feet, all of that didn’t exist in Chun Yeowun’s time.\n‘And why are their clothes like that?’\nTheir clothes were much tighter than the ones he was wearing.\ns\nFew people wore the same kind of clothes but in different colors.\nEven the skirts the women were wearing were short enough to expose their thighs!\nIn words, it felt weird.\n‘Strange.’\nThere was one thing that made Chun Yeowun feel even stranger.\n‘Suffocating.’\nStarting from the air around, the energy was very turbid.\nLike everything was full of impurities.\nAs Chun Yeowun was able to reach the Heavenly Master Level, he could grasp the energy of Nature.\n‘It would be difficult to gather qi if the people of this era lived in such a place.’\nImpure energy is rather detrimental to the body.\nIf the martial artists or the monks were here, they might have been terrified of this place.\nBut not Chun Yeowun.\nFor him, who had the five cores of the Spirit Beasts, circulating the energy inside his body and purifying it was possible, and he could cultivate energy inside his own body.\n“Ouch! My hand!”\nChun Yeowun looked at the police officer suffering in pain.\nHe was the one who tried to subdue Chun Yeowun, so he had to act as such.\n‘Are the ones wearing these clothes, the officials of this world?’\n[That’s right.]\nNano spoke about the rules of this new era.\nNano said that the man groaning in pain was equivalent to a soldier, but Chun Yeowun, who wasn’t afraid of the emperor in his time, wouldn’t be scared of a mere soldier who tried to cuff his hands.\n‘Tch, this is troublesome.’\nNot that he fell, but because he landed in a place that brought a lot of attention.\nThere were more than a hundred people gathered around him.\nWould it be right to say that the people were watching him as if they were watching a play?\nAt that moment, a cry entered Chun Yeowun’s ears.\n“It’s against the law to attack a police officer. Now, raise your hands and get down on your knees. Otherwise, I will have to fire!”\nA newly emerged man in his mid-thirties was aiming his gun.\nHe was Lee Myeong, the 3rd team leader of the Public Security Bureau.\nAsking him to raise his hands and get down on his knees was the same as asking for him to surrender.\nChun Yeowun asked Nano in a displeased tone.\n‘Nano. Still unable to gather information?’\n[Couldn’t connect because of the jammers blocking the network.]\n‘Tch.’\nChun Yeowun shook his head.\nNano’s attempts to access the web were stopped after officers approached him.\nChun Yeowun knew nothing of this era.\nBut he thought that Nano, a machine from the future, would know something.\nSo, he asked Nano to extract information from the era and transfer it into his brain, but he never expected it to be interrupted along the way.\n‘What should I do?’\nHe was worried.\nIt wasn’t difficult to get out and hide.\nAs Nano said, it would be possible to reconnect with the web once the area with the jammer was left.\n‘There’s that annoying one.’\nThere was an existence that Chun Yeowun could feel.\nA person was watching him from a window of the building across from him.\nThanks to that person, Chun Yeowun convinced himself that this era wasn’t entirely unknown to him.\n‘It would be better to get out of here now.’\nHe was getting too much attention.\nIt would be even more troublesome if something happened there, in an era he knew nothing about.\nIt was the moment when Chun Yeowun was about to take a step forward.\n“This is the last warning! Raise your hands and get down on your knees.”\nLee Myeong shouted.\nSince there were many people, he would refrain from firing unless something else happened, but Lee Myeong’s instincts were telling him,\n‘He’s very dangerous.’\nHe was even thinking of shooting him in the thigh or ankle.\nHowever, if this man really had something to do with the unidentified object which fell from the sky, he had to follow protocol.\n‘Is the Mobile Strike Team here?’\nCatching this unknown man with bare hands seemed like a dangerous thing to do.\nThose who could take down a trained officer with light gestures were either Gate Keepers or,\n‘Murim...’\nTak!\nAt that time, Chun Yeowun tried to move.\nWithout thinking, Lee Myeong aimed at his thigh and pulled the trigger.\nBang!\nAll he had to do was take this unknown man alive.\nBut then it happened.\nSwosh! Tuk!\nEven the people watching were confused.\n“No... way!”\n“He cu-cut the bullet?”\nWhat fell on the asphalt floor was none other than the bullet which was shot from the gun.\nThey didn’t know because the man was wearing a robe, but before they knew it, Chun Yeowun was holding a white blade.\nThe White Dragon Blade.\nIt was one of the two swords that always stayed on Chun Yeowun along with the Sky Demon Sword.\nThat was when Lee Myeong knew the person’s identity.\n“Murim warrior!”\nHe didn’t get that from the weird clothes. Instead, he got it from the fact that no one in the world could cut down a flying bullet with a sword besides a Murim warrior.\n‘Why would a Murim warrior be in the middle of the road wearing the old fashioned...’\nIt was then.\nShrek!\n“Ugh!”\nIn the blink of an eye, Chun Yeowun was in front of him.\nBewildered, Lee Myeong tried to aim his gun, but he was out of time.\nGrab!\n“Kuak!”\nLee Myeong, who was grabbed by the throat, dropped his gun.\nHe couldn’t help it. It felt like his neck would break right away if he tried to struggle.\nThe officers on the other side were too startled to aim their guns at Chun Yeowun, who spoke.\n“You will have to pay the price for using those firearms on me.”\nHe spoke like an old man, but that didn’t matter.\nLee Myeong tried to shake off Chun Yeowun’s hand with the jujutsu he learned as a public security cadet.\nBut,\n‘Wh-What power!’\nHe couldn’t do anything.\nAt this rate, it wouldn’t be shocking if he broke the neck with sheer strength.\n“Let the inspector go!”\nThe moment the officers were about to open fire to help Lee Myeong.\nSlash!\n“Ugh, my g-gun!”\nThe guns were split in two.\n“Hiik!”\nShocked, the officers took a step back.\nThey understood that it wasn’t just the guns, but if the man wanted, he could cut the two officers down too.\nThere was nothing else they could do.\n“Do you know about Murim people?”\n“Cough! Cough!”\nChun Yeowun was listening carefully.\nThe moment he cut the bullet, this man had called him a Murim warrior.\nFor some man who didn’t know martial arts, to know about Murim meant that he was either related or knew about it.\nChun Yeowun eased his grip to let the man speak.\n“Cough! Cough!”\nWhen the grip eased, the man coughed.\nHe asked again.\n“Do you know about Murim people?”\nIn response to Chun Yeowun’s question, Lee Myeong asked an unexpected question.\n“Cough... cough... are you... an unregistered... Murim warrior?”\nChun Yeowun frowned.\n“Unregistered?”\nUnless he misunderstood something, registration meant that one had to report and fill out a form.\nIt was surprising that a public official, a police officer of the future, would say such a thing.\n‘What is this? Does the government and the Murim not have a non-aggression pact in this era?’\nSomething was off.\nThe word ‘registration’ seemed to have something to do with this era’s inner workings.\nAnd it was worth finding out more.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun, who clenched the neck, noticed a singularity.\n‘Huh? This guy isn’t some normal person, a dantian...’\nStartle!\nAt the same time, Chun Yeowun noticed a red dot shining on the back of his hand, which was holding Lee Myeong’s neck.\n‘This?’\nIt wasn’t just one.\nNano’s voice told him.\n[The lasers of thirty sniper rifles are being aimed at the user.]\nBefore anything could be said, Chun Yeowun’s eyes caught some movements.\ns\nDozens of men in black uniforms, wearing headgears, bulletproof vests, appeared among the civilians and formed a siege.\nThey were the Public Security Bureau’s Mobile Strike Team, with the Public Security mark engraved on the right side of their chests.\n‘They came quickly.’\nLee Myeong, the leader of the 3rd team, was pale-faced when he looked at Chun Yeowun and spoke with a smile.\n“Things have turned around. Unregistered Murim warrior.”",

      "content": "Shenyang City Public Security Bureau’s 2nd Mobile Strike team leader Wei Yang received news that an unidentified flying object fell from the sky and rushed over to rescue people with a nervous mind.\nThere was no Gate Warning, and in that situation, it was really dangerous if something popped out.\n‘How could the defense system on the walls not catch it?’\nUnless it had a stealth function, the medium-altitude surface-to-air missile system (HQ-36) should have been operated and used to intercept the flying object.\nBut that didn’t happen.\nIt was like something else fell from the sky.\nAs they hurriedly boarded the team bus and moved, another piece of news came in.\n“What? A human?”\nThat was unexpected.\nThey thought that it was an object from a Gate. At least their anxiousness disappeared.\ns\nBut another question arose.\n“That means that a person fell from the sky?”\n“Y-Yes.”\nThey didn’t know if they had to go ahead with their strike.\nBut, a human, that wasn’t impossible.\n‘A Gate Keeper or a Murim warrior?’\nFalling from a high place would be dangerous for anyone, but sometimes, exceptionally talented people would show up, those who transcended the limits of human beings.\n‘If it’s a Gate Keeper, they must apply for permission from the Public Security Bureau in advance to engage in activities. They wouldn’t do such things.’\nIf so, there was a high probability that this person was a Murim warrior.\nThe weird thing is even the Murim warriors were registered, which made it strange that one of them would appear in the middle of public like that.\n‘I need to see it for myself. Among the Murim, some of them shouldn’t be allowed to run wild.’\nIt wasn’t difficult to find where the incident took place.\nThe area with vehicles and a crowd of people.\nExperienced team leader Wei Yang first sent out the snipers to the surrounding buildings and then pulled out something like a mechanical telescope to inspect the situation from a distance.\nWeigh!\nAround more than 300 meters away, but he could see.\n“What? That crazy bastard.”\n“Huhu! Is that true?”\nIt was thought that it could be a Murim warrior.\nHowever, it was the kind of clothes that the people in Murim usually wore in historical dramas.\nHe saw a young man with long hair in old-fashioned attire in an image on the tablet screen held by So Pyeong, who was next to him.\n“Check their identity with facial recognition.”\n“Understood.”\nAfter that, So Peyong tapped the tablet a couple of times, then an identity search window popped up, and he dragged the young man’s image onto it.\nAs the program ran, the facial recognition proceeded rapidly.\nSsh!\nThe pictures kept changing on the screen.\nSoon the results were out.\nFrowning, So Pyeong frowned and showed the tablet to team leader Wei Yang.\n[Unidentified]\n“Unidentified?”\nThis wasn’t an expected result.\nThey searched through the Chinese government’s identity network, but nothing came up.\nThere should have been some kind of minimal information, but nothing could be found.\n“What’s this?”\nIn that case, there were two assumptions.\nThere was a possibility that the identity wasn’t registered or the face was altered by some surgery.\n“Tch. Nothing is working out.”\nIf so, it would only be possible to learn his identity after capturing him and getting his fingerprints, using iris recognition, and doing blood tests.\nAnd then voices came from his earpiece.\n-A1 at Sangmyung shopping center 6th floor ready to shoot.\n-A2 at Yeonwoo building 17th floor ready to shoot.\n-A3 at...\nOne after another, the snipers of the Mobile Strike Team sent radio messages saying they were ready.\nOnce the sniper deployment is complete, the strike team would need to set up a siege.\nTeam leader Wei Yang spoke into his earpiece.\n“There are a lot of people, so be careful. Aim your lasers and wait.”\n-Roger!\n-Roger!\nWith the hand signal from the team leader, the Mobile Strike Team carefully moved.\nIt was then.\n-This is B4, team leader! The 3rd team leader of the violent crime squad has been taken hostage!\nWei Yang’s face distorted at the report.\n“3rd team leader? Lee Myeong? No. What is wrong with that bastard!”\nThere was no time to be surprised.\nIf a hostage was taken, they were pressured to prevent the unknown man from doing anything stupid or running away.\nAnd it was for this purpose that the snipers were brought in.\n“All snipers aim at the suspect with your lasers.”\n-Roger!\nWhen the order was issued, the red lasers aimed at the young man with long hair.\nMeanwhile, the Mobile Strike Team secretly approached and tried to encircle him. They quickly passed through the gaps in the crowd.\nTeam leader Wei Yang shouted in a loud voice.\n“Don’t be shocked! You are being surrounded.”\n“Woah!”\n“Public Security Mobile Strike Team!”\nWhen about forty armed people appeared, the citizens cheered.\nFrom their point of view, the young man who broke a police officer’s arm was nothing more than a dangerous person.\n“Kuk... if you take your hand off my neck, I will guarantee your safety.”\nLee Myeong of the 3rd violent crime squad made a proposal to Chun Yeowun.\nIt was all done.\nChun Yeowun’s entire body was being aimed at by sniper rifles.\nHe would have no choice but to back down.\n“You better get your hand off my neck...”\n“I see that you can still smile.”\n“What?”\nShh!\n“Huk!”\nLee Myeong’s face turned pale in an instant.\nHe thought that the Murim man had no choice but to give up. He was practically trapped between the Strike Team and the snipers.\nBut the man brought a pure white blade to his neck.\n“W-What is this... do you really want to die?”\nThe man stuttered as he spoke.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun looked around, not caring.\n‘Ha! Is he not afraid for his life?’\n2nd team leader Wei Yang thought.\nThe sniper rifles all aimed for his vital points, one shot was enough to kill the man, but the man brought out a blade and threatened the hostage.\n‘Is he coming out strong?’\nSome criminals didn’t give in to threats.\nA strong strategy.\nHowever, team leader Wei Yang had a lot of experience.\n‘Threatening the police. You are putting yourself at a higher risk.’\nThere was one thing that the Public Security Bureau was praised for being better at than other police forces.\nIf the life of a public security officer is threatened, the suspect will be eliminated at any cost.\n‘Arms and legs can be shot.’\nTeam leader Wei Yang raised his hand and sent the signal.\nAnd one sniper answered.\n-This is A3 sniper. Roger!\nIt was a Mobile Strike Team sniper aiming for Chun Yeowun’s wrist, which was holding Lee Myeong’s neck.\nIf the sniper shoots, Chun Yeowun would lose his wrist.\n‘You brought this on yourself.’\nWhen the signal came again, the sniper pulled the trigger without hesitation.\nBang!\nChun Yeowun’s wrist was being shown on the screen...\nPak!\nAs the bullet moved, a shriek could be heard.\n“Kuaaak!”\nThe sniper who pulled the trigger was confused.\nHe was one of the top three snipers among the Shenyang City Public Security Bureau’s Mobile Strike Team.\nWhich was why he was given permission to aim at the wrist, which was the most difficult place to hit.\n“What the hell...”\nChun Yeowun’s wrist was intact.\nIt was none other than 3rd team leader Lee Myeong, who screamed from being hit by the bullet.\nWhen the bullet was shot, Chun Yeowun pulled back, and the bullet pierced the left shoulder of Lee Myeong.\n‘That idiot! Making a mistake at such a crucial time!’\nTeam leader Wei Yang thought it was the sniper’s mistake.\nAnd now, this will make the suspect more aware of his surroundings.\nBut the reaction was strange.\n‘What now?’\nOn the contrary, it was the same casual expression.\nBe it a Murim warrior or not, when someone’s life is being threatened, some kind of response has to be there.\nWhatever it was, people were watching everything.\nIf things weren’t resolved quickly, the status of Public Security would fall.\nShh!\nWei Yang changed the hand signal.\nBlowing off his wrist proved risky, so they decided that it was better to shoot his leg.\n-Roger!\nThe sniper, who was aiming at the back of the right calf, pulled the trigger.\nTang!\nThe calf was wider than the wrist, and the chance of the hostage getting hit was less.\nIt was then.\nWheik!\nPak!\n“Kuaaaal!”\nA scream.\nBut again, it was Lee Myeong who screamed.\n‘N-No fucking way!’\nWei Yang was at a loss for words.\nAs soon as the bullet was fired, Chun Yeowun swung the body and used Lee Myeong as a shield.\nLee Myeong, who had his thigh pierced, felt like he was going to die.\n‘He noticed the sniper?’\nSomething outrageous happened.\nIt couldn’t be a coincidence that the unknown man was using Lee Myeong as a shield.\nGrunt.\nWei Yang ground his teeth. He didn’t know the unknown man’s origin, but he was definitely not a normal Murim warrior.\n‘... a master?’\nIf so, he felt sorry for Lee Myeong, who got caught.\nWhile the others were hesitating, Lee Myeong shouted.\n“Kuaaak! Strike team leader! Don’t worry about me and sh...”\nClench!\nAs Chun Yeowun clenched tighter, he was unable to speak.\nHowever, it was well known to the others that Lee Myeong was ready to make sacrifices.\n‘It can be dangerous.’\nSniping was the only answer.\nIt wasn’t known how this Murim man was detecting the snipers, but if all the snipers shot at once, he wouldn’t be able to use him as a shield.\n‘Lee Myeong. This is a bummer, but you make the Public Security proud.’\nWith determined eyes, Wei Yang tried to signal the snipers to shoot all at once.\nIt was then.\nPhat!\n“Haa!”\nWoong!\nWei Yang’s body, which was about to give a hand signal, floated and got dragged.\nIt was upsetting how nothing could be done.\nThe man in the shadows standing by the window of the opposite building explained.\n“Hidden Void Energy!”\nThe art of moving things with profound energy.\nIt was only possible to learn it at the Super Master Level, and to drag people, that was only possible for those near the Superior Master Level.\n‘He’s a great master!’\nThe man’s eyes gleamed with greed.\nMeanwhile, Wei Yang, who was being dragged, got grabbed by the neck.\n“Kuak!”\nNow, Chun Yeowun had a second shield.\nWith a cynical voice, Chun Yeowun spoke to Wei Yang.\n“You are the leader.”\nHe saw how this man gave so many hand signals.\nWhen the leader was captured, the other team members went stiff.\n“Kuak!”\n“Now send the hand signal for those in the distance to shoot their firearms.”\n‘!?’\ns\nAt those words, Wei Yang’s face turned pale.\nNow that he was taken hostage, he couldn’t command the snipers.\n‘Kuak! This bastard!’\nWhen Wei Yang was silent, Chun Yeowun’s lips formed into a smile, and he asked Lee Meyong, who was in his other hand.\n“When did things ever turn?”",

      "content": "The situation could be called instantaneous.\nAt first, the civilians who were watching from a fairly narrow street moved back when the guns were fired. People retreated to a safe distance to watch.\n“He took two police officers hostage?”\n“Doesn’t that make him a major criminal?”\nThe Public Security Officers were a symbol of the Chinese government.\nAnd Chun Yeowun, who was threatening the Public Security Bureau, felt like an evil villain to the citizens.\nEveryone watched while holding their breaths.\n-What should we do, team leader?\n-Won’t the team leader be in danger now?\nThe worried voices of the snipers could be heard through the earpiece.\ns\n“Damn it! Hold fire for now!”\nSo Pyeong, the second-in-command for the 2nd Mobile Strike Team, was at a loss for what had to be done.\nNo one ever imagined that their leader would be taken hostage.\nThirty snipers were all aiming for one man with forty men around him.\n‘Strike team! Keep a distance of at least 50 meters!’\nAt the command of So Pyeong, the strike team on the ground stepped backwards.\nIt was impossible to let themselves get caught like the team leader.\n‘This isn’t our jurisdiction. We should have called for the 5th Strike Team.’\nThe 5th team was called the Special Mobile Strike Team.\nThey were a special team created to deal with criminals who had abilities, including Murim warriors.\nThey were in a situation where they had to make the request, but,\n‘At a time like this, the 5th team is busy.’\nWhat a coincidence.\nLess than an hour back, they were dispatched for another operation.\nIn the end, this situation had to be solved by the 3rd Strike team.\n-What should we do?\n-Are we going to respond according to the manual?\nNaturally, there was a manual on what to do when an ally is taken hostage.\nIf not favorable, the manual spoke about sacrificing the ally or allies to reduce further damage.\n‘Damn it!’\nIt wasn’t an easy decision to make.\nIt took considerable determination to issue an order that would sacrifice their leader, who they had been working with for years.\n‘Leader...’\nWhile he hesitated.\nWei Yang, whose neck was in Chun Yeowun’s hand, calmed himself.\n‘Calm down. I need to be calm.’\nNothing good would come out of provoking this man who held his life, and if he couldn’t persuade the man, then he would end up with a bullet in him.\n“Kuak. Ta... taking... us hostage.... Do you think you can change the situation?”\nProvoking criminals wasn’t a good decision.\nAnd this man, this man had a cold look in his eyes.\nIt was safe to say he was not at all confused.\nIf the unknown man was so calm, then it was safe to say that words could get through to him.\n“Even if you catch... me the... leader... you won’t be able to dodge... all the bullets.”\n“...”\nIt’s more frustrating when there’s no response.\nHowever, weakness couldn’t be shown.\n“We... aren’t... hostages... in such cases... the manual... says to shoot... everyone.”\nThe truth.\nThe man announced that he was of no value.\nIt was unknown how the Murim man would react, but it would be the final judgment.\nHowever, unexpected words came out of Chun Yeowun’s mouth.\n“Are you saying this because you trust the 30 men?”\n“What?”\n“They are aiming at me from afar.”\n‘!?’\nWei Yang’s eyes widened.\n‘How... how does he know that?’\nFor a moment, he was shocked.\nThe strike team on the ground was nearby, so their number could be easily counted.\nBut the snipers.\nThe lasers were pointing from all directions, but there was no way one could know how many snipers there were.\n‘Wh-Who is this...’\nIt was an impossible task even for a Murim warrior.\nBut not for Chun Yeowun.\nPrrr!\nChun Yeowun’s pupils had white particles shimmering in them.\nThe augmented reality was open.\nChun Yeowun, who had the 7th generation Nano Machine in his body, could use features from the future.\nBeep! Beep! Beep! Beep!\nThe location of the snipers was accurately captured by the augmented reality.\nAnd the angles of the lasers were also calculated.\n‘Aimed from a higher place to reduce collateral damage.’\nOf course, even if it wasn’t for Nano’s analysis, their locations were grasped by the subtle angles of the lasers.\n‘Should I get rid of them?’\nThings were easy for Chun Yeowun.\nPeople might think that the distance was far, but it was within Chun Yeowun’s range.\nIt wasn’t difficult for Chun Yeowun to deal with them, but there was one thing holding him back.\n‘This has gone on for too long.’\nToo many people were watching.\nEven Chun Yeowun, who killed numerous people without hesitating, never puts his hands on innocent people who didn’t harm him.\n‘I’m not sure where I am, but I can’t just show them my abilities, especially with so many people watching.’\nEven without using a sword, he would be able to dodge the bullets using internal energy.\nHowever, he didn’t want everyone to know his capabilities.\nIt was then.\n[Can you hear me?]\n‘?’\nChun Yeowun’s eyes narrowed.\nThe voice he just heard wasn’t someone speaking near him.\nIt was a telepathic message.\nIt was a technique in which the Murim warriors would transmit their voices to another person through low energy.\nSwish!\nChun Yeowun looked somewhere.\nIt was the window that was ajar on the fifth floor of the opposite building.\nStartle!\nThe one standing there flinched.\n‘There are so many people around. How did he figure out where the message was sent from instantly?’\nTheir shock couldn’t be hidden.\nThat person was watching the situation because he thought Chun Yeowun was amazing, but this was beyond their imagination.\nIf this was his level, then negotiation might be worth it.\n[Is that you?]\nChun Yeowun’s voice came through their ears.\nThe one in the shadows nodded.\n[You are amazing. You instantly knew where I was.]\n[What is your purpose?]\n[My name is Jo Yu-seong. Since we are running out of time, I’ll skip the long greetings. I would like to make a proposal.]\n[Proposal?]\nChun Yeowun’s eyebrow shot up.\nThis one in the shadows had been staring at him from the start, so he thought he was up to something, but this was unexpected.\n[I think you are strong enough to get out of this situation. But, since you have been exposed to Public Security and many people saw you, you’ll face many difficult situations in the future.]\nHe seemed like a good negotiator.\nEspecially considering how he managed to understand Chun Yeowun’s abilities.\n[It has been a long time since you started confronting them, regardless of the jammers, the media will be coming soon.]\n‘Media?’\nChun Yeowun didn’t know what the media meant.\n‘What is that, Nano?’\nMedia is an activity that reveals and announces certain facts through newspapers, television, and the Internet or creates public opinions on certain issues.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun’s era didn’t have a newspaper, TV, or even the internet. Nano collected the information about the media and transferred it.\n[I will transfer the relevant information about the media to the brain.]\nTttt!\nWith a slight throbbing headache, everything relevant about the media was sent.\n‘A kind of live news.’\nChun Yeowun, who understood it, frowned.\nAccording to Nano, this era was a society with a lot of information exposure.\n‘Such an annoying world.’\nThis meant, hiding information was cumbersome.\nIn Chun Yeowun’s head, Jo Yu-seong’s voice was heard.\n[If you allow us, we would like to help.]\n‘We?’\n‘We’ meant that this person wasn’t alone.\nIt seemed like it was a group.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun didn’t trust those who approached him without revealing their true intentions.\n[What’s your purpose?]\nChun Yeowun asked directly.\n[Of course, I understand your concern. Let me be honest, I am astonished at your martial arts, and as a man of modern Murim, I’d like to scout you in exchange for my help.]\n[Scout?]\nFortunately, Chun Yeowun had received the information on English from Nano.\nSo, he knew scout meant recruiting people.\n[And if I refuse?]\n‘Ah...’\nJo Yu-seong frowned at Chun Yeowun’s strong words.\nHe waited until the last moment to make an appearance and he was sure that Chun Yeowun would accept his help. But this was unexpected.\nBut this man was a veteran who made dozens of negotiations.\n[I’m not asking you to make a decision right now. How do you feel about meeting my boss and discussing the matter?]\nA polite next suggestion.\nAt least this was a matter worth considering.\n‘If he’s this strong, then it’s worth bringing him back at a later time too.’\nThis man was drunk after seeing Chun Yeowun in action.\nIf Chun Yeowun refused to do that too, there was really nothing he could do, so he looked at Chun Yeowun with tense eyes.\n‘Hmm...’\nChun Yeowun was worried.\nThere were several ways he could prevent this situation.\nThe extreme ways to deal with the people, starting with invisible mode.\nHowever, he was exposed, and if he used that, it would become troublesome.\nThinking, Chun Yeowun sent a message.\n[... how do you plan on helping?]\nJo Yu-seong smiled.\n‘Nice!’\nThe first step to a successful scout.\nWith a satisfied face, Jo Yu-seong sent a message about the ‘help’ to Chun Yeowun.\nBut Chun Yeowun’s expression was a bit subtle as he heard it.\nOn the other hand, Wie Yang, who was being held by the neck, made a decision after much deliberation.\nThere were a lot of people watching.\nIf he thought about his own life, then it would cause distrust among the civilians.\nCautiously Wei Yang sent a hand signal to So Pyeong.\n‘Leader!’\nThe eyes of the second-in-command went wide.\nIt was a signal which meant to stop worrying and shoot.\nEven if the unknown man knew how many snipers there were, he would get hit if thirty bullets were shot at the same time.\n‘Leader... I will never forget your sacrifice. You are the real pride of the Public Security Bureau.’\nSo Pyeong, who looked with teary eyes, made the decision,\nShhh!\nAs he raised his hands, his eyes turned red, and the snipers put their fingers on the triggers with bitter feelings in their hearts.\n‘Leader!’\n‘Shit!’\nSimultaneous shots went off as soon as the hand signal was given.\nIt was then.\nThud!\n“Cough!”\n“Kuk!”\nJust as the snipers shot, Chun Yeowun dropped Wei Yang and Lee Myeong.\nChak!\nAnd retrieved the White Dragon Blade he had left on the ground.\ns\n‘What!?’\nSo Pyeong, who was determined to make the decision, was confused.\nIn a few seconds, the situation changed.\nDisappointment in an instant.\n‘... what the hell is this guy trying to do?’",

      "content": "5 minutes ago.\n[First, I would like you to surrender to the Public Security Bureau.]\n‘?’\nIn an instant, his reasoning cracked.\nFrom when he was a student in the Academy to when he turned into the Lord called the Demon God till now, Chun Yeowun never even thought of the word ‘Surrender.’\nIt made no sense to him.\n‘You want me to surrender?’\nIf he wanted to, Chun Yeowun could annihilate all the officers, including the snipers, in the blink of an eye.\nIt was just that he didn’t understand the current era, so he decided to take a step back.\n[... you call that being helpful?]\ns\n[Please don’t misunderstand. Words aren’t always appropriate. I don’t really mean to surrender.]\n[What do you mean?]\n[The Public Security represents the Chinese Government. From the government’s point of view, we keep a close eye on the Murim warriors who are active without a registration.]\nCome to think of it, the man whom Chun Yeowun was holding did say something about being an unregistered Murim.\nIt meant that in this era, Murim was being bound.\n‘Ah...’\nSuddenly, Chun Yeowun remembered the words of Chun Mu-seong, his descendant.\nChun Mu-seong said that the non-aggression pact between Murim and the empire disappears in the future.\nThe future the descendant came from was hundreds of years later, and Chun Yeowun wasn’t that aware of the future.\n‘I’m stuck. Did Murim regress?’\nAs of now, he couldn’t figure anything out.\nSo far, he only found two traces of the Murim.\nOf course, Chun Yeowun wasn’t the kind to make hasty judgments based on that.\n[I’m just saying, it seems like you are not registered, am I right?]\nSince Chun Yeowun wasn’t a person of this age, there was no way his identity was registered.\nChun Yeowun expressed his affirmation.\n‘Right!’\nIn Jo Yu-seong’s hand was a simple hand telescope.\nWith that, he was able to see So Pyeong, performing an identity-check of the Murim man.\n‘Optimal talent.’\nIf the identity couldn’t be found, of course, that meant he was an unregistered Murim warrior.\nA person with that kind of stubbornness would have been seen or heard about, but not once did he hear about such a man.\n‘Maybe he hid himself.’\nEven in modern times, some people hide their identities by disappearing for a long time, especially in Murim.\nJo Yu-seong was convinced that Chun Yeowun was such a person.\n[Rather than surrender, I want you to think of it as waiting while cooperating with the Public Security Bureau.]\n[... to avoid friction?]\n[Right! If you continue to confront each other in a situation with too much attention, it will only worsen. Which is why I’m asking you to pretend to cooperate with Public Security for a while. We need time to prepare.]\n[Hmm.]\nThey had to prepare him an identity.\nIt wasn’t sure how it would help, but in the current situation, the only option Chun Yeowun had was to use force.\n[How long do I have to wait?]\nAt Chun Yeowun’s question, Jo Yu-seong answered.\n[We will solve it within 24 hours.]\n’24 hours?’\nChun Yeowun was puzzled, for which Nano helped him.\n[One hour as in two here. 24 hours means 12.]\nWith those words, the general information on the time unit of the present-day was known.\nChun Yeowun sent a message.\n[Too late.]\n[What?]\nJo Yu-seong couldn’t hide his shock.\nSince it was late evening, it would take some time to prepare the identity.\nBesides, he had to report to his superiors before he did anything.\n‘This is becoming tough.’\nHe needed some leeway.\nHowever, when he heard Chun Yeowun’s voice, he could feel that the man wasn’t interested.\n‘He’s as demanding as his skills.’\nEven so, he had to show that his organization was capable to some degree.\nIn a hurry, he replied.\n[All right. We will fix this in 12 hours. I promise on my honor.]\nIn one shot, it was reduced from 24 hours to half the time.\nIt was on the border between what he could and couldn’t do.\nWhether the connection with Chun Yeowun would stay or not depends on how quickly the man solved the problem.\n[Fine.]\nAcceptance fell from Chun Yeowun’s mouth.\nJo Yu-seong, who was worried that Chun Yeowun would keep pushing him, sighed.\nBut then, Chun Yeowun said,\n[But! Promise on your arm, not honor.]\n[Yes?]\n[If you are a little late, I’ll take your arm in return.]\nIt was the warning which made him tremble.\nJo Yu-seong, who was surprised for a moment, understood that he had to hurry.\n[Understood. We can do that.]\nJo Yu-seong barely persuaded Chun Yeowun and left the building he was in.\nIt was because he had to get away from the jammers to begin his work.\nWei Yang, the 3rd team leader of the Mobile Strike Team, went stiff.\nChun Yeowun didn’t seem like the kind to back down, but now he said that he would respond to the calls of the Public Security Bureau.\nIt was a bit weird, but it felt like the man was human.\nIf the man didn’t cooperate, they would’ve been shot together.\nBut there was a problem.\n‘Something’s up.’\nAt first, he thought Chun Yeowun had decided to step back from the push-and-pull.\nNo matter how strong the Murim warrior was, Wei Yang believed that anyone would become weary when their life was at stake.\nHowever, this wasn’t the attitude someone who surrendered was supposed to have.\n“T-Team leader?”\nThe team members looked at him, not knowing what to do.\nEventually, Wei Yang had to ask.\n“What do you mean you won’t give up your weapon?”\n“It’s what you heard.”\nChun Yeowun didn’t bother giving a reason.\nRather, he threatened to cut down anyone who even touched the tip of his blade.\n“... look here, man. What am I supposed to think when you clearly said that you will respond and cooperate with us but refuse to release your weapon?”\n“For a Murim warrior, our weapon is our life. Isn’t that common sense?”\n“Common sense?”\nWei Yang was at a loss for words.\nThose who carry around blades or swords are normally subjected to investigation by the Public Security, and if they are imprisoned, their weapons will be taken away.\n‘I’m going crazy here.’\nAnd the clothes, the clothes which can be seen in the old martial arts historical dramas.\n‘Haa. It isn’t like he’s someone from the past who fell into the modern world with some time machine...’\nShockingly, that was accurate.\nHowever, time machines didn’t exist in this era.\nWei Yang glanced around.\n“Woah!!!”\nCivilians who thought the case had been resolved came over and cheered.\nThey were all cheering for the Public Security.\n‘Damn it.\nAnd during this time, if they couldn’t even retrieve the weapons of the criminal or handcuff him, they would be ridiculed.\nIn other words, people would make fun of the Public Security.\nHowever, they couldn’t push their luck with Chun Yeowun.\n‘Damn it. Only if he wasn’t a Muri...’\nJust a while back, this Murim warrior dragged away their team leader.\nThat was when he heard someone’s voice.\n-Team leader.\nIt was So Pyeong.\nHe was the one who helped Lee Myeong, the 3rd team leader, to a hospital by car, as he was hit by two bullets.\nHowever, there seemed to be something in his hand.\n‘Ah!’\nWei Yang recognized it at once.\nWith a smile, So Peyong, who was far away, said.\n-Let’s use this, team leader.\nIt was something that was borrowed from the 5th Special Mobile Strike Team, which had yet to return.\nBefore they met Chun Yeowun, they were all thinking of returning that object to the 5th team. They never guessed that they would be able to use it.\n‘Good. Now...’\nWei Yang spoke very softly to Chun Yeowun.\n“Look. There is something called pride. How would it look if we couldn’t escort the man who was harming the Public Security without following our protocols?”\n“I said I would cooperate. I don’t remember surrendering to you men.”\nWei Yang’s face almost contorted.\nAh, it was different. Both words had different meanings.\nAlthough his rage was boiling, he knew that it was physically impossible to suppress Chun Yeowun, so maintaining his calm, he said.\n“Citizens have eyes. And we are the guards of the Chinese Government’s law enforcement. Please.”\n“I refused.”\nChun Yeowun didn’t back down.\n“Sigh, fine. Fine. Then we will give up on retrieving your weapon. Instead, we’ll handcuff you until you enter the bus. And we’ll release you once you get in. I’m asking you to do this in consideration of the honor the Public Security has.”\nWei Yang gave up his pride and pleaded with Chun Yeowun.\n“Please, please.”\nChun Yeowun looked into the eager eyes and held out both his hands.\n“Don’t try anything.”\n“Of course not!”\n‘Yes!’\nWei Yang felt happy.\nNot saying anything else, he called for the second-in-command.\nAs if waiting, So Pyeong put the handcuffs on Chun Yeowun’s wrists.\nClap!\nThe handcuffs were different from what the other officers had.\nThey were on the thicker side, box-shaped, and there was a machine installed on them. After putting them on, So Pyeong pressed a button.\nYes,\nClench!\nThe handcuffs tightly sealed around Chun Yeowun’s wrists.\nIn addition, special energy rose from the machine, which was in the middle of the handcuffs.\n[The mechanical device is generating a wave that disperses energy.]\nChun Yeowun’s eyes narrowed at the words of Nano.\nThe wave emitted from the handcuffs had the effect of dispersing the qi and the internal energy he had accumulated in his time.\n‘I was right.’\nChun Yeowun shook his head.\nHe predicted that something was going to happen. He just couldn’t put his finger on it.\n‘Weird.’\nIf there was one thing he was curious about, then it was why Nano, which had the future’s technology, didn’t know about the identity of the handcuffs.\nWith a smirk, Wei Yang spoke.\n“Thanks for putting on the handcuffs. Let’s go on the bus and make sure you have a good time. Huhuhu.”\nClap.\n“Move. Walk to the bus over there.”\nSo Pyeong pulled out his gun and pointed it at the back of Chun Yeowun’s head.\nTheir voices changed as if they were talking to just another criminal.\nStep!\nChun Yeowun silently moved to the place where the bus with iron grills was.\nWith a satisfied face, Wei Yang smiled.\n‘This works fine. Huhu, in preparation for the future, I will have to ask my superiors for more things that the 5th team uses.’\nThe handcuffs put on Chun Yeowun were used to arrest Murim warriors.\nIt was used to dissipate their energy and neutralize them.\nWheeing!\n“Get in.”\nWhen the door opened, So Pyeong ordered him to enter while holding the gun.\nChun Yeowun silently entered the bus.\n“Kay. Withdraw.”\n“Roger.”\nWith that, the other strikers boarded the bus one after another.\nFinally, Wei Yang boarded the bus and closed the door.\nWei Yang pressed a button on the center console, which was near the driver’s seat.\nClick!\nAnd then, the transparent windows of the bus darkened to avoid anyone from seeing inside.\nWhen it was completely cut off, the mobile strikers, including Wei Yang, fixed their guns under their seats.\nAnd then pulled out the black rods from their waistbands.\nSrrr!\nAs Wei Yang swung the rod, Chun Yeowun saw that the rod’s length had increased.\nIt was a stage three stick used for striking.\nSo Pyeong pulled out a few cords and then said,\n“The black box has been powered off.”\n“Phew. Well done.”\nTak! Tak!\nWei Yang slammed the rod into his palm as he slowly walked towards Chun Yeowun.\nWith the corners of his mouth raised into a smile, he spoke.\n“Kay now. Let’s try to discipline the stern attitude you showed before. Murim man? Haa! When did young people who learned martial arts become this cocky? For a guy like you, this...”\nCrack!\n‘What!?’\nWei Yang stopped speaking.\nSomething unbelievable just happened.\nCrack! Fall!\nThe handcuffs, which were supposed to be firmly closed, fell to the ground.\nShaking his head, Chun Yeowun said,\n“You believed in that toy?”\nWei Yang was so shaken that he couldn’t speak.\n‘H-How could this happen? Was the device broken?’\nNo, the handcuffs were working fine.\nIt was just that Chun Yeowun’s level was far beyond what the handcuffs could dissipate.\nOf course, even if that wasn’t the case, his strength alone had surpassed human limits, so he could have broken out of the cuffs.\n‘Damn it...’\nWhatever the reason, it broke, and this was the worst.\nWei Yang, who believed in the efficacy of the cuffs, tried to get his revenge on Chun Yeowun.\n“T... that...”\n“Didn’t I clearly warn you to not play around?”\nChun Yeowun stretched out his hand towards the man.\nWei Yang, who was five steps away, got pulled in.\n“Oh, NOOOO!”\nWei Yang grabbed onto the bus seat of either side to not get dragged, but.\nHe was helplessly dragged away.\nTak!\nChun Yeowun grabbed both his wrists.\nWei Yang, scared, yelled out.\n“W-Wait up! If you harm Public Security...”\n“You brought this on yourself.”\nCrack!\nWith an eerie sound, Wei Yang’s arms broke in a bizarre manner, and the shattered bones popped out.\n“KUAKKK!”\nIt was so painful that Wei Yang couldn’t stop screaming.\n“Team leader!”\n“Thi, this... stop!”\ns\nRight, Chun Yeowun had to be stopped, but everyone was so frightened that they couldn’t move.\nThey were holding rods in their hands, but they were scared.\nIgnoring them, Chun Yeowun spoke to Wei Yang, who was in pain.\n“This is the fun time you’ve been waiting for.”\nHey guys, I’m toying with the [Text in brackets] so let me know what you think!

      "content": "Woong!\nShenyang City’s Regional University Hospital’s emergency room.\nIt was the only place which was open at 6:30 pm in the evening.\nParamedics rushed Lee Myeong, the 3rd team leader of the Public Security, to the emergency room.\nAs his bleeding was too severe, the ambulance took urgent measures to stop hemostasis and did a blood transfusion.\nHowever, despite being in pain, Lee Myeong didn’t pass out or tremble.\n‘Phew...’\nThroughout the ambulance ride, he was confused.\nA man who didn’t seem like the kind to step back suddenly backed out.\nLike, something was happening.\ns\nTatak!\nThe on-call surgeon and nurses, who had been contacted by the paramedics, rushed into the room.\nThe surgeon who came in mumbled.\n“Tch. This is the third time already.”\nBefore Lee Myeong was brought in, two officers were brought here.\nAnd this man was literally the third patient from the Public Security Bureau.\n“Please move him this way.”\nThe surgeon guided the paramedics to an empty bed.\nAt his signal, the paramedics and the nurses lifted the pedestal of the stretcher and moved the man.\n“One, two!”\nThud!\n“Euk!”\nThey moved as carefully as possible, but the wounds still hurt.\nLee Myeong was close to crying.\n‘Damn it. I wanted it to turn into a dream, for me to meet that crazy ass. Haa.’\nStill, this was better than dying.\nThe surgeon on duty cut off his shirt and pants with medical scissors.\n“You did a great job stopping the bleeding.”\nThe surgeon praised the paramedics’ skills.\nThe surgeon who removed the bandages and gauzes from the wounds said to the nurse.\n“Prepare antibiotics.”\n“Yes, sir.”\nWhen the bandages were removed, Lee Myeong clenched his teeth, trying not to scream.\nIt was the parts where the bullets penetrated. There was no way that it didn’t hurt.\nThe surgeon, who was wiping off the dried blood with a sterile gauze, examined the wound on his shoulder and shook his head as he looked at the thigh.\n“Ahh!”\nHe tried pressing the area.\nLee Myeong lifted his upper body from the bed with wide eyes. He looked at the doctor who was examining the area.\n“Is it serious?”\nThe mobile striker who followed Lee Myeong in the ambulance asked with concern.\nThe surgeon answered with a curious expression.\n“Did you say that he got hit by a sniper rifle?”\n“Yes.”\n“He’s a leader of the Public Security Bureau, right? And this is definitely amazing. Really amazing.”\n“Sorry?”\nLee Myeong, who laid down, and even the mobile striker were puzzled.\nThe surgeon put it in layman’s terms.\n“Well. Taking a closer look, one can see that the bullet pierced cleanly. The shoulder and the thigh, the bullet went through flesh and no bones.”\nThe surgeon pressed the thigh to check the damage to the bone.\n“After the test, I will follow our procedures and check for any infection near the wounds. You will have to receive treatment, but you can be discharged in about a week. It’s better to start with desk work.”\nAt the words of the surgeon, Lee Myeong was shocked.\nDespite how much the medical field has changed, he expected to stay hospitalized for several weeks due to muscle or bone damage.\n‘... what shit.’\nHe was attacked by the Murim warrior in old clothes.\nBut according to the doctor’s words, he wasn’t just used as a human shield, but the man made sure that Lee Myeong received as little damage as possible.\n‘Is... is this really possible?’\nIt was such an amazing ability that was unbelievable for even a Murim warrior to have.\nAnd then the emergency room phone rang.\nBeep! Beep! Beep!\nThe nurse near the desk moved.\n“Yes. This is the ER.”\nMaybe it was a direct line inside the hospital.\nER.\nThe nurse, who had been listening to the call with a serious expression, spoke.\n“Sir! Ten emergency patients from Public Security are being escorted in!”\n‘!?’\nAt those words, Lee Myeong and the other mobile striker turned towards the nurse.\nThe surgeon frowned as he asked.\n“More from Public Security?”\nWithin an hour, patients from Public Security kept coming in.\nAnd this time, the number was ten!\nThis meant that a team was injured.\nThe mobile striker cautiously asked the nurse who answered the call.\n“Do you know which unit is coming?”\n“I remember it being the 2nd Mobile Strike Team. I don’t think there’s much time difference, co-workers?”\n“Yes?”\nAt the nurse’s words, Lee Myeong was shocked.\nThe news was a shock to these two, who thought that the Murim warrior was successfully caught.\n‘... what the hell happened?’\nHalf-past eight in the evening.\nA black sedan headed towards the Shenyang City Public Security Bureau.\nA middle-aged bearded man sat with his legs crossed in the back seat of the car. He was Ho Il-kyung, the deputy director of the Shenyang City Public Security Bureau.\nHe’s someone who could be called the second-in-command.\nBut on the way to the Public Security Bureau, he was constantly complaining.\n“I don’t get it. How can a person be so stupid? It’s clear that I have an important appointment today. I need to be flexible enough to do my own work, but those who work below me need my presence.”\n‘What is he saying, and what is he doing? Working? Is staying with a young woman over your lovely wife at home called working? This guy is the deputy director of Public Security. Tch tch.’\nThe driver thought to himself.\nAs a salaried worker, he couldn’t voice his true feelings.\nRather, he smiled and said.\n“That’s right. Deputy director, it must be horrible going to work at this time.”\nThe driver’s job would only stay if he knew his place.\nBut the man had a temper.\nWith a weird smile, deputy director Ho Il-kyung responded.\n“Are you stupid? How could they call in someone who just left work? It’s because of those bastards that men like you are able to keep their bloody driver jobs.”\n‘This dog! How should I match his flow!’\nIn an instant, the driver swore.\nFinally, they managed to arrive at the office.\nShenyang City Public Security Bureau.\nThe bureau had three buildings.\nOn the left was the Transportation Department. In the middle was the Public Security, made up of powerful teams and various departments. And the building on the right was where the Special Ability Division and Mobile Strike teams were deployed from.\nTak!\nMaybe they were waiting in advance. A man in his early forties in front of the building came down the stairs.\nIt was Song Wei-kang, the head of the violent crimes division.\nLooking through the glass, Ho Il-kyung mumbled.\n“This isn’t some simple greeting. Tch tch.”\nIf he passed the examination, which will be held in a while, he could get promoted to director.\nUnless something happened.\nClick!\n“Respect!’\nPerhaps it was a familiar act. Son Wei-kang, the head of the violent crimes, opened the back seat door and saluted.\nAs soon as he got out of the car, Ho Il-kyung’s face changed.\n“Right. What kind of a mad man brought us all together?”\nHe asked with a smile.\nAs soon as the door was closed, the driver stuck out his tongue and raised his middle finger.\nWhile riding the elevator going down to the 5th basement of the Public Security Bureau, Song Wei-kang gave a rough report.\nTo that, Ho Il-kyung asked.\n“What? What the hell is that? You’re saying that he threw ten people, including the team leader who were in the task force bus?”\n“... according to the surgeon in charge of the emergency room, the regenerative treatment is possible with surgery to the fractured bones, so it might take 3 weeks.”\n“Haa!”\nThe year 2047 had a breakthrough in treatments.\nA regenerative treatment developed in Germany, a technology that accelerated recovery on a cell-by-cell basis.\nIt was a popularized technology, internal and external injuries could be healed in a fortnight, unless it was some genetic disease.\n“And they let go of such a man who was capable of doing that?”\nThe man shook his head and spoke.\n“Because he was a Murim warrior, they couldn’t even touch him. Even if they wanted to, two team leaders and one unit got injured.”\nSong Wei-kang had witnessed it.\nFor the Murim man to wave his hand and make people fly.\nNo one could touch him.\n“Maybe the team is made up of idiots! Tch tch! Call that special task force. The 5th Special Mobile Strike Unit. It’s a Murim warrior, so they should deal with it.”\n“Deputy director. That team was put near the wall by the city’s northern outskirts because of the drug dealing site of a Murim organization which was...”\nAs if he only remembered then, Ho Il-kyung rubbed his forehead with his hands.\n“Haha. Yes. Was that happening at 4pm? Shouldn’t they have sorted it out by now and come back?”\n“I was on the radio, but they are still arresting the criminals and returning.”\nThen, the deputy director smiled.\nThe media had been making a lot of noise about the drugs.\nCalling it some significant achievement.\n“Nice. That’s a good thing.”\nIt would have been really good if their plan wasn’t happening now.\nWith a stiff expression, the deputy director asked.\n“Where the hell did that crazy bastard come from? What the hell is going on?”\n“That...”\n“What? Spill it!”\n“We couldn’t confirm his affiliation because his identity wasn’t registered.”\nDeputy director Ho Il-kyung frowned at the words of Song Wei-kang.\n“Unregistered?”\nDuring his time as deputy director, he never once came across an unregistered Murim warrior.\nHe did hear from time to time that such things happened in other cities, but it never happened under his jurisdiction.\n“He hasn’t said anything?”\n“He has exercised his right to remain silent ever since he came here.”\n“Haa. Even dogs and cows are being given the right to remain silent. That man is supposed to have fallen from a fairly high place, but isn’t something suspicious? Is it related to them?”\nHe wasn’t referring to any group which committed crimes like the Forces of Evil.\nAmong the Murim organizations, there was quite a large organization working.\nIt was tough to touch their bases, even for the Public Security Bureau.\n‘This is getting worse and worse.’\nAnyway, the guy was brought in, but they didn’t know anything, not even his name.\n“At first, we ran a fingerprint search and an iris recognition scan, but nothing matched. Finally, we called for a blood test, we called Dr. Cho from the medical side. The interrogation room has been prepared for the test and questioning just before the deputy director arrived.”\n“Tch, let’s go there and see.”\nThey headed for the interrogation room after talking in front of the elevator on the 5th basement floor.\nThe place where the man was kept was the 4th interrogation room.\nThey entered the room, which was next to the interrogation room.\n“Salute!”\nInside, a short-haired woman and a large man got up and saluted.\nThey were detectives belonging to the 3rd team of the violent crimes division.\n“Quiet.”\nDeputy director Ho Il-kyung raised his finger to his mouth and made a gesture for them to stay silent.\nThis was a room connected to the interrogation room. It was an observation room which no one could see into, as it had specially treated glass.\nThe ones in this room could see the interrogation room, but not the other way around.\nThere was only one table in the interrogation room, and a young man with long hair and a pure white face was seated at it.\nHe was Chun Yeowun.\n-I’m only going to draw a little blood for identification. No harm is being done.\nThe voice inside the room could be heard through the speaker in the observation room.\nIn the interrogation room, Cho Se-jong, a public security medical team member, held a blood sampling syringe and tried persuading Chun Yeowun.\n“Is he the one?”\n“Yes.”\n“He really looks like someone out of a historical drama. Did you at least retrieve his weapon?”\n“... we apologize.”\nDespite what he wore, it pissed off the deputy director that his weapon couldn’t be taken away.\nHo Il-kyung approached the glass and took a look.\nStartle!\n‘Uh?’\nChun Yeowun, who had been sitting still, suddenly looked at him.\nAll that Chun Yeowun could see was the mirror, so how could he look exactly where this man was standing?\nHe asked Song Wei-kang who was behind him.\n“He can’t see us, right?”\n“It wouldn’t be possible even if he tried.”\nThe glass was like a mirror inside the interrogation room.\n‘Maybe I was mistaken?’\nChun Yeowun looked back at Cho Se-jong.\nHo Il-kyung thought that it was a coincidence and looked at him again.\n“Is the blood not drawn yet?”\n“We tried to, but he keeps thinking we are trying to harm him.”\nAnswered the female detective behind him.\nSuddenly, Chun Yeowun held out his arm and said,\n-Try taking it if you can.\nHearing those words from the speaker, Ho Il-kyung shook his head.\n“Is that man mental?”\nCho Se-jong of the medical unit sighed in the room and picked up the syringe.\nThen, a rubber tube was wrapped around Chun Yeowun’s right wrist.\n“Relax your arm. It will sting a little.”\nCho Se-jong tried to insert the needle into Chun Yeowun’s vein.\nHowever,\nCrack.\n“Uh?”\nInstead of piercing the flesh, the syringe needle broke.\nCho Se-jong, who was pretty experienced, wasn’t the kind to make mistakes. He changed the needle.\nThen he asked Chun Yeowun.\n“You can’t flex your arm. Relax.”\n“I didn’t do that.”\n“Phew... understood. Anyway, don’t flex. Your veins will hurt.”\nCho Se-jong checked if Chun Yeowun was clenching his fist or not.\nAfter confirming that he wasn’t, he once again moved the needle towards the vein.\nCrack!\nWhen the needle broke, Se-jong realized that it wasn’t a mistake.\nThe needle broke as if it hit a strong object.\n‘Who’s flesh is this hard?’\nThe needle can go in as long as it stabs the right place, no matter how thick and strong the muscles are.\nSe-jong, who realized that, tried to replace the needle.\nClench!\n“Huk! W-What’s this?”\nChun Yeowun grabbed the man’s arm.\nIn a low voice, he spoke to the one who was bewildered.\n“Isn’t it enough that I gave you two chances?”\n“Ugh! Let, let me go!”\nWith pain and fear that his wrist would break, Se-jong screamed.\nThat was the signal for the detectives in the observation room to come and help.\n“Damn it!”\nThe two detectives in the other room panicked and tried to run.\nHowever, looking through the glass, as if he could see who was all there, Chun Yeowun spoke.\n-Try doing something useless, and I break this man’s wrist.\n‘!?’\nThe faces of the detectives in the observation room went stiff.\nThey felt like Chun Yeowun was looking at them but discarded it as some coincidence.\nTak!\nChun Yeowun got up from his seat.\n“Ouch! My, my hand!”\nSe-jong complained as he was in pain, but it was ignored by Chun Yeowun, who moved closer to the glass while dragging the man.\n‘Huh?’\nThe place he went was where the deputy director was standing.\ns\nHe was looking more precisely than before, making the deputy director turn as stiff as a stone.\nChun Yeowun said.\n-You seem to be in a higher position than the others.\n‘Gasp!’\nHo Il-kyung, who was frightened by the voice he heard through the speakers, unknowingly took a step back.",

      "content": "PM 09:03\nThere was silence in the observation room next to the interrogation room.\nRegardless of the distance, not a single person could even blink their eyes.\nDeputy Director Ho Il-kyung was so surprised that he couldn’t even turn his head while speaking to Song Wei-kang, the head of the violent crimes division, who was standing behind him.\n“... Song. Is this really working?”\n“H-He shouldn’t be seeing...”\nIt was only possible to see through the tinted glass or the special glass in the interrogation room while using a special device from the military Mobile Strike team.\nBut seeing Chun Yeowun, it felt like he could really see through the glass.\n“How can someone who shouldn’t be able to see me stare at me!”\nHo Il-kyung yelled.\ns\nWhen Song Wei-kang couldn’t come up with an answer, the short-haired female detective spoke.\n“Deputy Director. He could be deliberately trying to sway us with a bluff.”\n“Bluff?”\n“How many times does an interrogation room appear in the movies and dramas these days? There is no way they wouldn’t know that someone is behind the glass.”\nAt her calm words, Ho Il-kyung shook his head in disappointment.\nCalling this a bluff is stupid.\nThat man was looking straight at the Deputy Director and spoke about his position too.\n‘This guy is a Murim warrior. We can’t think of this from an ordinary person’s point of view.’\nHo Il-kyung, who was shaken until a second back, calmed down.\nTo get to his position, he didn’t just play golf and entertain his dumb superiors.\nHe agreed with one thing the female detective said.\n‘He could be trying to sway us.’\nIn that case, he shouldn’t appear shaken.\nGetting caught in the criminal’s pace would make it difficult to conduct the interrogation.\nEven if this glass couldn’t stop him from seeing, the glass shouldn’t have a problem with being bulletproof and soundproof.\nHo Il-kyung pressed the button in front of the glass and calmly opened his mouth.\nClick!\n“Can you see us?”\nHe had to be sure. He needed confirmation.\n-Didn’t your man say that it couldn’t be seen through?\n‘!!!’\nHo Il-kyung frowned at Chun Yeowun’s words.\nAgain, he spoke while looking through the glass.\nThe atmosphere was so silent, it should have been hard to know if someone was in the observation room or not.\n‘... cheeky bastard.’\nFor some reason, he felt annoyed at Chun Yeowun’s attitude.\nNot losing his composure, Ho Il-kyung pressed the button and spoke.\n“Let the doctor go.”\nHo Il-kyung demanded the release of Cho Se-jong.\nIf he kept holding the man, then the doctor would turn into his hostage.\n-Euk, pl... please!\nCho Se-jong, who was frightened, almost begged Chun Yeowun.\nHo Il-kyung continued to speak in a calm manner.\n“If you let the doctor do his task and go. I will make sure that your punishment is kept to a minimum.”\nAn attempt to negotiate.\n“I am the Deputy Director of the Public Security Bureau. I have the discretion to close my eyes in special cases.”\n-Deputy Director?\n“There is only one person above me here. Are you still unable to trust me?”\n-Huh?\nOf course, it was a lie. He was just bargaining for the life of the doctor.\nHo Il-kyung’s mind was already filled with thoughts of punishing the man in the interrogation room.\n‘I will show you how it’s done.’\nThe CCTV cameras in the interrogation and observation room were still running, and people who worked for him were watching, which meant that he had to showcase his skills as much as possible.\n“Deputy Director, negotiations with criminals...”\n“I will take responsibility for this.”\n“Deputy Director...”\nThe others were unaware of that and thought that their Deputy Director was trying to save the doctor.\nThey didn’t know that Ho Il-kyung was a master at creating a favorable image.\nHowever, there was another reason why Ho Il-kyung was trying to negotiate.\n‘Huh. Do I look like I will negotiate with criminals?’\nHo Il-kyung’s eyes were looking elsewhere.\nIt was the free hand of Cho Se-jong.\nAn anesthetic injection which was half out of his pocket.\nCho Se-jong was the doctor in charge of most such cases.\nAnd every time he entered, he would come prepared for all possible situations.\n‘With a little bit of attention diversion from him, that can be used.’\nHo Il-kyung smiled.\nHe had to do anything to keep Chun Yeowun from noticing it.\nClick!\nHo Il-kyung pressed the button again and spoke.\n“We won’t do the blood test, so let the man go...”\nCrack!\n-Kuaaak!\nBefore his words even finished, a scream erupted from Cho Se-jong.\nCho Se-jong, whose wrist was broken, groaned in pain.\nUnable to control his anger, Ho Il-kyung stomped and shouted.\n“What the fuck is that bastard doing!”\nHe didn’t expect this to happen without the injection being given.\nWith a condescending tone, Chun Yeowun spoke.\n-I guess you are stupid. Did you think that I couldn’t see it through the mirror?\n‘This...’\nThe Deputy Director was speechless for a moment.\nBecause of Chun Yeowun’s attitude, he forgot that the glass in the interrogation room acted like a mirror.\n‘Shit!’\nIf he had thought clearly, he would have discouraged Cho Se-jong from using that injection.\nIt was Chun Yeowun’s way of saying that it was your own mistake.\n-Is there any reason why I would take this man hostage?\n“What?”\n-Don’t do useless things. And let go of that illusion that I came here because I was afraid of you men.\nAt Chun Yeowun’s warning, Ho Il-kyung punched the glass with his fist.\n“This... this bastard!”\nHe forgot about creating a favorable image and ended up cursing him.\nNot Song Wei-kong nor the two other detectives said anything while looking at their boss.\n‘How can that cheap bastard even threaten me? The Deputy Director of the Public Security Bureau?’\nIt wasn’t nice.\nThe attitude of the man who was locked up in the interrogation room.\nFavorable image or whatever, he couldn’t suppress himself anymore.\nHo Il-kyung, who used his fist on the glass, suddenly realized something.\n‘Huh? Hold on, did I press the mic button before?’\nHe was so angry at the sudden incident that he didn’t realize it.\nApparently, the mic button wasn’t pressed when he swore at the man.\nLooking back, he asked Song Wei-kang.\n“... did I press the mic button by any chance?”\n“Uh?”\nHe could tell just by the shock.\nHe surely released the button in shock when he saw the wrist being broken.\n‘H-He... is he?’\nThe observation room is soundproof, so even if one shouts inside, the sound would never flow out.\nBut Chun Yeowun could listen to them.\nHo Il-kyung stared at Chun Yeowun with fear in his eyes.\n“Yo-You... what the hell are you?”\n/strong>\nChun Yeowun answered in a low voice.\n“I have no reason to tell you. Don’t bother me anymore while I’m here. This is your last warning.”\n“Ha!”\nHo Il-kyung exclaimed.\nThe criminal was speaking with an attitude that said he was going to leave the interrogation room very soon.\nTrying to suppress his anger as much as possible, Ho Il-kyung asked Song Wei-kang without looking back.\n“Interrogation rooms 4 and 5 are for people with special abilities, right?”\n“Y-Yes. He’s here because he’s a Murim...”\n“Okay.”\nHe asked to confirm it.\nThe interrogation room Chun Yeowun was locked in was exclusively for people with special abilities.\nAmong those with special abilities, including Murim warriors, some believed in their own power and never cooperated with cops.\nSo, this chamber was made of a special alloy.\nThe glass between the rooms was made of a bulletproof material that could withstand more than 15 minutes of grinding with a machine and not break.\nClick.\nHo Il-kyung opened a safety box next to the microphone.\nIt had two buttons.\nOn the left is a green button that releases the tranquilizer and sleeping gas, and on the right is a red button that releases tear gas.\nA device installed to subdue those who ran rampant during interrogation.\n“Haa.”\nHe took a long breath before looking through the glass.\nIf the man could hear him, then he didn’t have to press the button to talk.\n“I don’t care what kind of backing you have.”\n“...”\n“For harming the lives of Public Security officers, you will be placed in jail for 24 years. I have seen dozens of people who bluff about believing in their abilities.”\nHe spoke calmly, but there was a tremble in his voice.\nIt was clear that he was angry.\nWith his index finger, Ho Il-kyung was about to press the red button.\nSong Wei-kang, who saw that, was perplexed.\n“Deputy, Deputy Director. Dr. Cho is still in the room.”\n“Stay back!”\nHo Il-kyung held out his palm and made a gesture to not get closer to him. Glaring, he continued to speak to Chun Yeowun.\n“You asked us to not bother you? Ha! Mental bastard. I’ll bet my position as the Deputy Director to ensure you will never see the light of day again. You won’t leave the interrogation room. If you get out, you’ll be tagged as a criminal and immediately brought to trial...”\nBang!\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun struck the glass with his palm.\nJust the palm, but the glass swayed as if it was struck by a powerful fist.\nThere wasn’t a scratch on it.\nShocked, the Deputy Director flinched but soon smirked, confirming that the glass was working.\n“Haha! You think the bulletproof glass is called bulletproof for nothing? As if it would break with just a palm...”\nJjjkkk!\n‘!?’\nBefore he could even boast anymore, the special glass began to crack around the place where Chun Yeowun’s palm struck.\nChun Yeowun didn’t even hit the glass a second time.\nGrrrr!\nThe glass around Chun Yeowun’s palm began to vibrate.\nThe vibration grew stronger and more terrifying.\n‘Th-This is crazy!’\nConfused, the Deputy Director tried to hastily press the red button.\nIt was then.\nCrack!\n“Ugh!”\n“Kyaa!”\nThe glass shattered like powder and covered the observation room.\nIn the aftermath, the two detectives, Song Wei-kang and the Deputy Director were all thrown to the wall.\nThud! Thud!\n“Cough! Cough!”\n“Uhh...”\nMost of the glass was turned into powder. If not for that, all their bodies would have been pierced with glass shards.\nThey bumped into the wall and fell to the floor, coughing at the sudden situation, and fainted.\nStep!\nIt was then, Ho Il-kyung heard the footsteps.⁽¹⁾\nAlthough he was unconscious, he knew that something terrible was about to happen and tried to pull his gun out, but his body floated.\n“Kuk!”\nBang!\n“Kuck!”\nHe was fixed to the wall of the observation room.\nThe Deputy Director, who was fixed to the wall by the unknown force, tried to move, only to fail.\nHe had the gun in his hand, but it was useless.\n“Deputy Director!”\nPull!\nThe large male detective pulled out his gun after coughing.\nThe short-haired female also hurriedly stood up and pulled her gun.\nBut,\nWheik!\n“Ah!”\n“G-Gun!”\nBoth their guns were pulled out of their hands and into someone else’s.\nIt was Chun Yeowun who entered the observation room.\nChun Yeowun, who was holding both guns in his hands, squeezed them.\nCrack!\nLike plastic toys, their guns shattered.\nIt was metal pieces that fell to the floor.\n‘N... no wa... way.’\nSong Wei-kang couldn’t even stand up. He was too stunned to even move.\nFrightened by this unknown power, the female detective slumped to the floor.\nThe male detective, who realized that their situation was the worst, rushed towards Chun Yeowun, thinking he had to do something.\n“You!”\nWheik!\nChun Yeowun lightly waved his hand towards the detective.\nWoong!\n“Ack!”\nBang!\nThe bulky male detective’s body flew towards the wall as if he was as light as a tissue.\nWith the bang against the wall, he began to bleed from his head and passed out.\n‘Th... this man... just how... is he doing this?’\nThe Deputy Director, who was fixed to the wall, was gripped with fear.\nDuring his life as a Public Security officer, he saw numerous Murim warriors.\nOf course, most of them were criminals who came in, but they were all nothing in front of this man.\nStep! Step!\nChun Yeowun slowly approached him.\nHe was just walking, but the Deputy Director could feel his heart intensely pound with each step.\n‘Please! Please!’\nHe wanted to say something, but he couldn’t even open his mouth.\nJjrr!\nHis trousers were warm and wet.\nIn a low growling voice, Chun Yeowun said.\n“I definitely warned you.”\nYes, he did hear the warning.\ns\nChun Yeowun looked intently at the Deputy Director, who stayed silent without saying anything, and thought for a second, then spoke with a smile.\n“Hostage... yes. You should do well for that role.”\n‘!!!’\nThe Deputy Director’s eyes widened as if they were about to pop out.\n⁽¹⁾ - Not sure how someone can hear something despite being unconscious/fainted, but we will roll with it.",

      "content": "PM 11:45\n“Haa... haaa...”\nIn the quiet interrogation room 4, a person was exhaling roughly.\nIt was Ho Il-kyung, whose face was wet with sweat.\nHis posture while sitting on the chair looked very uncomfortable.\nHis arms were drooping, but seeing his shoulders, it looked like they were dislocated.\n‘Ugh, damn it! To dislocate bones every now and then!’\nHo Il-kyung swore.\nIt looked like only the shoulder blades were dislocated, but even the elbows were dislocated.\nEven the slightest movement didn’t hurt.\ns\n‘How could I, the Deputy Director, end up like this?’\nAcross from him was Chun Yeowun, sitting in a chair with his eyes closed.\nA peaceful face, as if he was meditating.\n‘Damn you bastard. Are you saying that you’re not the least bit concerned after taking me hostage?’\nTrue.\nHe was the hostage of Chun Yeowun.\nThe Deputy Director of the bureau was being held hostage in the Public Security Bureau itself.\n‘Shit!’\nIt was wrong of him to reveal his position.\nHe just revealed himself as the perfect hostage.\nChun Yeowun took one hostage, warned them not to bother him anymore, and drove the other two detectives and Song Wei-kang outside the room.\nWith the glass between the two rooms broken, it was like the interrogation room and observation room were one.\n‘What the hell are they doing?’\nHo Il-kyung looked at the CCTV camera on the ceiling.\nSince the observation room was a mess, the only working CCTV camera was in the interrogation room.\n‘Are they not bothering to do their jobs? Why are the people who are supposed to rush in right away not arriving?’\nHis stomach swelled in anger.\nFrom what he heard through Song Wei-kang, it was clear that the Special Mobile Strike Team, the 5th team, had completed their mission and were returning.\nEven if they were on the outer wall of the northern side of the city, they should arrive in 40 minutes.\nBut there was no news of them.\nIt was painful yet numb because of the dislocated bones, but it was even more painful to see Chun Yeowun doing just fine.\n‘Ugh, just let me be released from here, that Song, that bastard will be transferred to the outskirts’ police station near the gate.’\nSong Wei-kang was the one who called the Deputy Director after work hours.\nWhile waiting to be rescued, Ho Il-kyung looked at Chun Yeowun.\nIt was late at night, so he wondered if Chun Yeowun was asleep.\nChun Yeowun didn’t even move.\nWatching that, the Deputy Director stood up very slowly.\nSsh!\n“You take one step, and I’ll break your legs, making you unable to walk.”\n‘Gasp!’\nHis heart dropped for a second.\nHe only got up, but Chun Yeowun spoke without even opening his eyes.\nSrr!\nThe Deputy Director, who got up, immediately sat down.\nChun Yeowun had his eyes closed, but he could still tell the movements.\n“I thought of breaking your legs right from the start.”\n‘!!!’\nAt the voice of Chun Yeowun, who spoke like he was annoyed, Ho Il-kyung prayed that he would wake up.\nThe Deputy Director grumbled.\n‘What the hell is that bastard doing with his eyes closed?’\nHe was about to go crazy.\nThere was a reason why Chun Yeowun meditated.\nHe spent time organizing and accepting the information which entered his head.\n‘Such a strange and surprising world.’\nThe future world, which was reliant on electricity and energy, was a shock to Chun Yeowun.\nNot just that, but everything from the culture to the society’s structure was completely different from the world he knew.\n‘A world without the Imperial family...’\nThat was what shocked Chun Yeowun the most.\nIn his time, the existence of the Imperial family was an obvious reality.\nIt was said that the current time had some foreign countries where royal families existed, but it was just a symbolic existence with no power.\nAt all of those changes, even his cold heart was shocked.\n‘Is this how the time changed? But.’\nJust Nano was enough to know how tremendous the change was.\nChun Yeowun kept his cool despite the new information because of Nano, which is far superior to modern technology.\n‘Well, the information that Nano just transferred to me is basic stuff, right?’\n[The wireless internet was blocked when we entered the Public Security building, so this was all I could gather.]\nThis was all the information that Nano could collect.\nSince the time was short to gather and organize the vast information of this era, Nano could only show some of it.\nThe highly confidential Public Security didn’t use wireless internet.\nMoreover, there wasn’t enough time to gather information with all of the jammers and the bus ride to this place.\nThe information Nano gathered was in the brief moment of getting off the bus and into the building.\nChun Yeowun asked Nano to transfer the collected information to his brain.\n‘Nano. I wanted to ask you this question a while back. I know that you were created several hundred years from now. If so, why couldn’t you just pass on the information that you know without having to collect it?’\nThis was the question.\nHe felt that collecting information was unnecessary.\nOriginally, Chun Yeowun wouldn’t ask such questions, but as he accepted the information from the present age and became more aware of computers and the internet, he began to have such questions.\n[There’s a significant difference from the saved data.]\n‘What?’\n[Society, culture, and technology all have differences from what is stored in the saved data, so I have to distinguish them.]\nChun Yeowun couldn’t understand it.\nThat means this is a different era from what Nano knew.\nChun Yeowun frowned.\n‘How can that be?’\nAt that question, Nano gave the most accurate answer.\n[There is a high possibility that this is another time axis.]\n‘A different time axis...? Ah...!’\nAt those words, Chun Yeowun remembered the words of his descendant.\nHis descendant Chun Mu-seong explained that his existence didn’t disappear even though the past changed because of his connection with the time axis.\nIt was said that as actions and decisions occur differently, the dimension of the universe is divided, and the time axes are different.\n‘Then this is a completely different world.’\nThe information stored in Nano was meaningless.\nIn terms of numbers, it meant that Chun Yeowun was starting from 0.\n‘So, how do we get back to the original world?’\nHe had reasons to go back.\nThe cult he was leading, Mun Ku, and his unborn child.\nHe couldn’t stay in this era.\nChun Yeowun, who was worried, asked Nano.\n‘Nano. Is there a time machine that I can use to travel... hm?’\nChun Yeowun, who was asking a question, stopped and opened his eyes.\nHe stared at the ceiling.\n‘Huh? Why is he doing that?’\nThe Deputy Director, who was looking at Chun Yeowun, was puzzled.\nThe second floor of the Shenyang City Public Security Bureau.\nThe air of the team on the second floor was the worst.\nThe 3rd team, including the off-duty detectives, were all summoned.\nThe Deputy Director of Public Security was taken hostage.\nBut there was no good way to rescue him.\nThe female detective with short hair and a face full of bruises smiled when this was asked by the head of the violent crimes division.\n“Any problems with the CCTV?”\n“It was said that there is no movement at all. The Deputy Director is still unharmed.”\nThe female detective had gone to the CCTV room to see what was happening.\nBang!\nSong Wei-kang smashed the desk with his fist.\n“Are you smiling? Are you smiling at this?”\nHe saw how the Deputy Director was humiliated before their eyes.\nThe shoulders and elbows were dislocated, and the screams.\nHe even peed.\n“... still, there are no further wounds on him.”\nThe female detective answered with a slightly dissatisfied voice.\nSong Wei-kang didn’t want to make eye contact with the woman who wasn’t taking her task seriously.\nIt was because she was the only one who didn’t fight in the observation room.\nHe couldn’t blame her for being scared.\n“Damn it! Where is the 5th team?”\nSong Wei-kang asked another detective.\nThe detective who was in charge of gathering information spoke.\n“There has been no response since the last radio message we got about an hour back.”\n“Haaa...”\nSong Wei-kang sighed.\nOriginally, the 5th team should have arrived at the office a long time ago.\nUnfortunately, they had a problem.\nIt was said that they were attacked by Murim warriors who seemed to have a connection with those they arrested.\nThanks to that, they couldn’t arrive at the set time.\nSong Wei-kang was nervous.\n‘Not much time left.’\nHe never dreamed that such an ordeal would come about.\nSince the Deputy Director was taken hostage right in front of him, there was a high probability that Song Wei-kang would be demoted if the situation wasn’t resolved.\n“Damn it. What kind of things are happening because of the criminal with an unknown identity? This is a shame on our bureau.”\n“That...”\nA detective spoke.\nMaking Song Wei-kang ask.\n“What?”\n“How about contacting Shenyang’s Murim Association?”\nSong Wei-kang frowned at those words.\nThe reason was well known to everyone.\nThe Murim Association, calling them would be horrible.\nIt would be a huge blow to the Bureau’s pride if they contacted them for being unable to solve their own problems.\nWhoo!\nSong Wei-kang grunted.\n“Say worthwhile stuff. If the Public Security asks for their help...”\n“No. At least we will be able to identify the person.”\n“Person?”\n“Isn’t it important that the Murim Association is trying to push for autonomy without interfering with our work?”\n“... true.”\nSang Wei-kang, who dismissed the idea, was now showing interest.\nThere was no good answer.\n“They always try to solve matters related to Murim by themselves, so wouldn’t they show interest in an unregistered one?”\n“You want us to throw a bait?”\n“Yes. Hopefully, we will know whether the person is registered in Murim or not and if they show interest...”\n“They will come out without us asking for cooperation. Why are you saying such an idea only now? You should have spoken right away!”\nAt Song Wei-kang’s words, the detective frowned.\nThe compliment didn’t sound like a compliment.\nAnyway, Song Wei-kang, who thought that the detective was right, searched for the Shenyang City’s Murim Association and pressed the call button.\nTring! Tring! Tring!\nWhen he dialed the number, he heard a familiar connecting tone.\n-We are the proud descendants of Murim. Inheriting the glory of our ancestors...\nIt was an old song with newer and more popular versions of it out.\nSong Wei-kang grumbled.\n“Aren’t they acting too sloppy? Isn’t this one from like 30 or 40 years back? This song isn’t even known to the public. And why use it for public institutions?”\nBefore he could nag anymore, he heard a voice.\n-Yes. This is the Shenyang City’s Murim Association.\n“Hello. This is Shenyang Public...”\n-Since our business hours are closed now, we won’t be able to serve you. Our phone consultations start from 9am...\n“Damn it!”\nBang!\nSong Wei-kang was so furious that he threw the receiver on the desk.\nThe time is 11:55pm.\nOf course, this wasn’t normal working hours.\nIt’s unnatural for the Public Security Bureau to work this late and even contact that Murim Association.\nBut when he contacted them, he only got disappointing results.\n“Damn it! Ah, does that Murim Association not have a single person doing their jobs!”\nHe kept grunting.\nKiik!\ns\nThe sound of tires stopping outside.\nOne of the detectives from the 3rd team looked outside and spoke with a bright face.\n“Chief! The 5th team has arrived!”\nSong Wei-kang jumped up from his seat.\nThe 5th Mobile Strike Team was the only team dedicated to special ability users.",

      "content": "The 5th Special Mobile Strike Team buses were lined up to the building on the right.\nSome of the buses were heavily damaged.\nThere were holes in the ceilings, and more than half of the windows were shattered. Repairs were urgently needed.\nAt least they were vehicles made exclusively for people with special abilities. If these were regular buses, then all that would have come back would be scrap metal.\n“Be careful while coming in. Don’t step on the rope over there!”\nFrom inside the bus, members of the Special Mobile Strike Team came out while slowly leading the criminals into the building.\nTwo, two handcuffs exclusively for special abilities were on their wrists and ankles.\nAnd the other criminals who were wounded and didn’t have the strength to resist were being pushed into the building.\nOf course, not everyone went in smoothly.\n“Let me go! You bastards! Let go!”\ns\nA bald, muscular man whose face was covered in blood was rebelling.\nHe was Son Mang-dal.\nHe was an important member of the Forces of Evil sect in Shenyang.\nIn the past, it was a wonderful group, but now it has developed into organized gangsters.\nAlthough it managed to develop into an organization, the root of it was the Murim people.\nWith the handcuffs on, he couldn’t use his internal energy anymore. However, it looked like he didn’t neglect his physical training. Despite two officers pushing him, he was able to resist.\nThat was when someone kicked him in the stomach.\nPuck!\n“Kuak!”\nTwo mobile strikers pushed him to the ground, and the bald man began to cough up blood from the kick.\nWiping the blood off his mouth, he yelled at the man.\n“Ouch! You fucking bastard. To use these handcuffs which forbids us from using internal energy, just to use it on us!”\nIf it hadn’t been for the kick, which used internal energy, there would have been no blood.\nThe man who kicked him took off his helmet.\nThis man, in his late thirties with a short and athletic hairstyle, was the leader of the 5th Special Mobile Strike Team, Yeom Chan.\n“You talk a lot for a drug offender! Son Mang-dal. Just be grateful that I didn’t kill you on the spot with my gun.”\nThe Chinese government didn’t take drug crimes lightly.\nIt was because they struggled with opium in the past.\n“Evil bastards like you, your roots never disappear despite not being active for years. All your crimes are based on drugs.”\nWith those words, Yeom Chan tried to kick Son Mang-dal, who barely stood up.\nIt was then that someone intervened.\n“Team leader Yeom. Stop that. Isn’t he already in custody?”\n“Chief.”\nThe person who stopped him was Lee Taek-yoon, the head of special crimes.\nHe also learned martial arts and was the chief of the division, which was dedicated to crimes committed by special abilities users, including Murim warriors.\n“It’s because this bastard needs to come to his senses...”\n“You are an officer. And I understand how you feel, but there is something to be done. They need to be placed in prison.”\n“... understood.”\nSince the chief was his superior, Yeom Chan calmed his emotions.\n“Take him away.”\n“Roger.”\nThose on standby grabbed the man and dragged him away.\nSon Mang-dal, who was being dragged away, glared at Lee Taek-yoon and said.\n“You must be wanting to play Good Cop Bad Cop, but you are all the same.”\n“What?”\n“Even if we distribute the drugs, we aren’t government dogs like you. Kayak! Spit!”\nSpit.\nThe thick phlegm of Son Mang-dal smeared the jacket of Lee Taek-yoon, who was on the right.\nThe corners of Lee Taek-yoon’s lips raised.\n‘This!’\nYeom Chan’s face went stiff.\nThis man should be taken away fast, but it was too late.\nLee Taek-yoon’s hand grabbed Son Mang-dal’s face.\n“Hmph!”\n‘This... this one’s eyes?’\nLee Taek-yoon’s eyes changed.\nIn an instant, the man seemed to have a different personality.\n“Dogs of the government? I should have just left you to die. The pests of society.”\nLee Taek-yoon raised his internal energy, lifted Son Mang-dal, and then threw him on the ground.\n“Ugh!”\nBang!\nBlood oozed out of his head which hit the floor.\nThere was no way to protect his body when the cuffs were still on.\n“Don’t try to act strong. In the end, you are criminals hated by the civilians, and we are civil servants that everyone envies.”\nKick!\n“Ugh!”\nLee Taek-yoon kicked Son Mang-dal’s head with his foot as if his anger wasn’t resolved yet.\nHe groaned for a while, and then Son Mang-dal didn’t move anymore.\n‘Ahh...’\nTeam leader Yeom Chan bit his tongue.\nLee Taek-yoon was famous for showing a restrained appearance, but he was even more famous for his violence when he got angry.\n“Phew.”\nMobile strikers checked if Son Mang-dal was dead and sighed.\nIt seemed like he only fainted after being kicked in the head.\n‘You idiot. Why did you have to anger the chief!’\nYeom Chan thought to himself.\nLee Taek-yoon was known to be unable to control his anger and to have killed criminals.\nIf what he heard was right, then Lee Taek-yoon could have been the head of the Forces of Evil.\n“Take him.”\n“Roger.”\nMobile strikers supported Son Mang-dal and dragged him into the building.\nAnd then, the process proceeded without any further problems. A familiar face appeared in front of Lee Taek-yoon.\n“... is the transfer complete?”\n“As... chief Song.”\nHe had come down like 5 minutes ago, but Song Wei-kang decided to stand back, as something seemed to have happened.\nCCTV room on the 1st floor of the Bureau.\nChief Lee Taek-yoon, who was looking at the large monitor playing footage from the 5th basement floor, stroked his chin.\nWhat he was watching was something recorded two and a half hours ago.\nThe facial expression of team leader Yeom Chan of the 5th team who was watching the video wasn’t great.\nDong Joo-myung, one of the team members, opened his mouth with a firm face.\n“Unless my eyes are showing me wrong, chief...”\n“... Superior Master Level!”\nLee Taek-yoon said that.\nThe team leader and the members were all aware of how strong the Murim man was.\nIn order to show such a level of skill, it was only possible for those who reached the state of Superior Master Level.\n‘An unidentified person?’\nIt was even more questionable that this person’s identity was unknown.\nSong Wei-kang, who was watching it, asked.\n“Is this tough?”\nIt was Lee Taek-yoon, the chief of special crimes, who could answer that question.\nIt would be no exaggeration to say that their demotion would be confirmed if they took up the mission to save the Deputy Director and failed.\n“We need to rescue the deputy director as soon as possible.”\nAt those words from Song Wei-kang, Lee Taek-yoon asked.\n“Did you say that even fingerprint and iris recognition aren’t working?”\n“Yes. We were trying to run a blood test, but then everything turned violent...”\nThere was no need to continue.\nEverything was shown on the CCTV footage.\n“Hmm. It smells fishy.”\n“You think so too?”\n“There is no way that a person can avoid ID Checks. Maybe it has something to do with ‘them.’”\nSong Wei-kang nodded in agreement.\nFalling from the sky to voluntarily entering the Bureau, there were too many questions and no answers.\nLee Taek-yoon got up from his seat.\n“Phew, nothing can be done. We don’t have a lot of time, so let’s hurry.”\n“We don’t have time?”\n“This man needs to be dealt with within 24 hours.”\n“What do you mean?”\nLee Taek-yoon pointed to Chun Yeowun on the monitor and said.\n“Didn’t he say not to bother him until he wants to leave?”\n“Yes. One cheeky bastard.”\n“Yes. He is.”\nGrind.\nSong Wei-kang ground his teeth just thinking of Chun Yeowun.\n“If he was a Superior Master, he could have escaped from any number of strike squads, but the fact that he deliberately entered the Bureau on his own feet means he’s waiting for a legal exit.”\n“Legal exit?”\n“If he is related to some organization, they will try to get him out within 24 hours, before the formal investigation is conducted and he is put on trial.”\n“Ah!”\nSong Wei-kang was shocked by the sharp insight.\nHe was so concerned about the safety of the Deputy Director that he didn’t think it through.\nClearly, Lee Taek-yoon was an excellent person in the Bureau.\nAs if the results were out, Song Wei-kang’s face brightened.\nIt was when Lee Taek-yoon asked him.\n“Then, is it okay if he dies?”\n“Sorry?”\nHe, who was just reassured, was confused.\nHe was ordered to capture and investigate the man who fell from the sky.\nThe man had to be captured.\n“Can’t he be captured?”\n“... for a Superior Master, it’s hard to do. If we want to catch him, we’ll end up sacrificing half of the team.”\nAt that, team members of the Special Mobile Strike Team nodded their heads.\nSong Wei-kang, who had no knowledge of the Murim warriors and their skills, couldn’t realize how dangerous the situation was.\n‘Right. Even if he’s captured, he will only cause more trouble for us. If he gets out, then we’ll miss the chance to bring him down. Rescuing the Deputy Director is more important.’\nHis job was more important to him.\nMaking a decision, Song Wei-kang asked.\n“So, is killing him possible?”\n03:20 AM.\nThe team leader and members of the 5th Special Mobile Strike Team, who were fully prepared, were divided into teams of 10 people in front of the elevator and the stairs on the left and right of the building; they also completed the preparations in a rush.\nContrary to hurrying, the time they started their mission was late in the morning.\nOf course, this was part of their plan.\nLee Taek-yoon’s earphone was working as someone spoke.\n-Check! Chief, he’s a Superior Master. Won’t he wake up from a single change in the air?\n“No matter how strong he is, there’s a difference between being in perfect condition and not being nervous. Ours is a strategy where we lower the opponent’s power as much as possible. Just focus on your mission.”\n-Roger!\nLee Taek-yoon seemed off.\nEven though he was fully prepared, he couldn’t hide the tension of dealing with a Superior Master.\nIt was the same with the other team members too.\n“Turn on the cam.”\nRoger!\nThe video was being sent to the other team members who had their goggles on, and the CCTV screen too was being shown.\n‘Hm.’\nIn the CCTV footage, Chun Yeowun, their target, was sitting still with his eyes closed.\nThey weren’t sure if he was asleep or not.\nBut the Deputy Director Ho Il-kyung, who was sitting across from him, was nodding his head from left to right as if he was asleep.\n“We might miss something. CCTV, I want it to be monitored and report anything that changes.”\n-Roger!\nAs the goggles were displaying two videos, he was worried that they would miss something.\n“Team A and B enter from the left and right stairs.”\n-Roger!\nThe team members who were waiting near the stairs on the left and right went down carefully when Lee Taek-yoon gave the order.\nTwenty people went down, but the sounds of their footsteps couldn’t be heard.\nIt was because of the specially made silent walkers.\n-This is Team A. second floor stairs on the left.\n-This is Team B. second floor stairs on the right.\nThey were going down the stairs very carefully, one step at a time, trying to kill any presence they had.\nLee Taek-yoon, who checked the CCTV footage, was relieved that the target didn’t notice and ordered them to move another floor down.\nWith tense eyes, the team members went down another floor.\nIt would normally take 3 minutes to reach the 5th basement floor, but now, they have taken 20 minutes.\n-This is Team A. 5th basement floor on the left.\n-This is Team B. 5th basement floor on the right.\nWhile they were moving, a smile appeared on Lee Taek-yoon’s lips as he looked at the CCTV.\nIt seemed like trying to catch the target before dawn was the right decision.\nIn the video, Chun Yeowun was still, with his eyes closed.\n“Team A and B use industrial anesthetic air gas bombs as per plan.”\n-Roger!\nAnesthetic gas.\nIt was developed to deal with Murim warriors.\nWhen the gas is inhaled, it acts like an anti-internal energy toxin.\nAnd it works wonders on paralyzing the nerves.\nSsrr!\nTeam A and B gently opened the stairs’ emergency exit doors and rolled five fist-sized balls.\nThey were the gas bombs.\nNormally two or three would be enough to cover the basement.\nHowever, considering that he is Superior Master, they decided to use five from each side just to be sure.\n-Grumble!\nAs the bombs with a silent function rolled on the ground and reached the right place, a hole formed, and the gas spurted out in all directions.\nShhooo!\nThe gas slowly seeped into the air.\nColorless and odorless gas, even the Murim man wouldn’t notice.\nAbout 5 minutes later, the team members who were holding their breath because of the tension relaxed.\n‘Haaa. I was told he was a Superior Master, but it looks like I was nervous for nothing.’\n‘This much means nothing.’\nThey weren’t the only ones with those thoughts.\nLee Taek-yoon, who was staring at the CCTV footage in front of the elevator, was also convinced that his mission was done.\nIf exposed to the gas for more than 5 minutes, even the Superior Master will have his energy dispersed and become paralyzed.\n“Team A and B enter the interrogation room at the same time and send a signal.”\n-Roger!\nWith that, Lee Taek-yoon spoke to the team on standby.\n“Open the elevator and move.”\n“Roger.”\nThe plan was to open the elevator ceiling and then use the line.\nJudging by the current situation, he thought taking the elevator would be fine, but then he asked them to use the line just to be careful.\nA mobile striker pressed a button on the elevator, and the door opened.\nSwoosh!\nIt was then,\n‘!?’\nInside the elevator was the young man with long hair.\nTheir target, Chun Yeowun.\n‘W-What the hell?’\nIt couldn’t be.\nThe CCTV footage clearly showed that he was in the room with his eyes closed.\nThen, how was he in the elevator!\n“D-Damn it!\nClank!\nThe team hurriedly tried to aim their machine guns at Chun Yeowun, but he vanished and appeared in front of Lee Taek-yoon.\nSwoosh!\n‘Shit!’\nShocked, Lee Taek-yoon tried to move away, but it was too late.\nClench!\ns\nHis neck was grabbed.\nPower so strong that it felt like his neck was going to break.\n“Cough!”\nWith an annoyed voice, Chun Yeowun spoke.\n“How long were you going to make me wait?”",

      "content": "03:54 AM\nBeep! Beep! Beep!\n-This is the CCTV room. Emergency! The target is in the elevator! All crew members must move quickly.\n“What?”\n“What does that mean?”\nThe team members waiting near the stairways of the 5th basement floor couldn’t hide their shock.\nUntil a second back, the mission seemed to be proceeding smoothly.\nBut it changed in an instant.\nBeep!\n“Oh?”\n“What is this video?”\nIn the CCTV video which they were seeing in their goggles, Chun Yeowun was still on the chair with his eyes closed.\nHowever, the video of Lee Taek-yoon being caught was seen on the other side.\nThey reacted in the worst way possible.\nWhoop!\n“Damn it!”\nWhen people heard the distressed voice of Lee Taek-yoon, they ran up the stairs without thinking.\nTatata!\nYeom Chan, the team leader, who was in charge of teams A and B, and Baek Woo-mun, the first team leader, were ahead of the others.\nLee Taek-yoon couldn’t be hurt.\nMeanwhile, the air in front of the elevator was different.\nNo one was moving, despite aiming for Chun Yeowun, who grabbed the chief.\nDrip!\nIn a few seconds, their faces inside the helmets were soaked.\nIt felt like they were prey standing in front of a wild beast.\n‘I couldn’t see him...’\n‘I didn’t even blink...’\nIt was a lot faster than a bullet.\nAll of them were then aware.\n‘This... this is a Superior Master!’\nThis existence couldn’t be compared to the criminals of Murim they had dealt with before.\nMurim was known to be the strongest power in the world during the opening of the Gates.\n‘Chief!’\nLee Taek-yoon was overpowered, and he was at a loss for what had to be done.\nListening to the squeaking sound through the earpiece, it was clear how dangerous the situation was.\nIt was then, Lee Taek-yoon tried to speak.\n“Wa... wait...ing... for whom?”\nHis eyes trembled.\nFrom what he said, didn’t it mean that he could detect everyone there from the 5th basement floor?\nEven if he was a Superior Master, he shouldn’t be that great.\n‘No. He was never at that level. At least, he’s at the end of the Superior Master Level... no, it should be higher. Just how did this monster stay hidden till now?’\nThe beginning and end of the Superior Master Level are different.\nWhen he was flustered by his thoughts, Chun Yeowun spoke.\n“Indeed, it’s different.’\n“What?”\nLee Taek-yoon couldn’t understand what Chun Yeowun was saying.\nNot caring, Chun Yeowun continued.\n“There are 3 Super Masters. 8 high-ranked, and then there are 3 men with different energies and 16, just okay people. Hmm.”\n‘!?’\nLee Taek-yoon was shocked.\nShockingly, their target was able to accurately grasp their power.\nYeom Chan, the mobile strike team leader who led Team A and B, Baek Woo-mun, and himself were Super Masters.\nAnd the power levels of the other members were also accurately stated.\n‘... he is bad news.’\nUnlike him, who was shocked, Chun Yeowun was puzzled.\nThe Murim of the future wasn’t as awful as what he heard from his descendant.\nThat didn’t mean the Public Security was amazing, just better than what he had imagined.\n‘So this is another time axis.’\nConsidering that the era he was in didn’t have an imperial family but an institution that commanded the officials.\nNano’s explanation made sense.\nIn any case, dealing with these people was a priority.\n[We will process it within 12 hours. You should exercise your right to remain silent while you are in the Bureau. Please refrain from acting out as much as possible.]\nThat was what Jo Yu-seong had asked.\nHe spoke as politely as possible, but he meant stay silent and don’t move.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun wasn’t the kind who had unconditional patience.\nHe never even knelt in front of the emperor.\nJust because the era changed doesn’t mean he changed.\n“I tried to be quiet, but you guys always ignored my warnings. Since you are in Murim, you need to be prepared for the outcome, right?”\nIn Chun Yeowun’s grasp, Lee Taek-yoon struggled.\n“Cough... put... me... down.”\n“Hm?”\n“Dog... put me... down.”\nWith that, Lee Taek-yoon pressed a button with his left thumb.\nAt that moment, a dazzling and sparkling light flowed around.\nCrackle!\nSparks flowed through Chun Yeowun’s hand.\n“This is it!”\nLee Taek-yoon, told the mobile strikers with a hand signal that they could fire.\nDududud!\nTring!\nLights were broken, and the corridor became dark in an instant.\nOnly the flashes from the muzzles could be seen.\nDudududu!\nLee Taek-yoon’s safety wasn’t even thought of.\nIt was like a sacrifice of allies.\nPapapak!\nThe bullets fired hit Lee Taek-yoon’s body, which had a protective suit on.\nBut the bullet didn’t penetrate.\n‘Kuaak!’\nThe protective equipment was bulletproof.\nIt could even withstand sword qi.\nOf course, even though it was bulletproof, it would still hurt.\n‘You idiot! Acting out because you are Superior Master?’\nHe was shocked when the target appeared.\nHowever, the plan went wrong right from the beginning.\n‘His muscles will become stiff due to the electric shock, no matter how strong he is. You will not be able to demonstrate self-defense.’\nHe never thought that he would have to resort to such a thing, but it looked successful.\nWhen the bullets fell, the target’s hands, which turned stiff, wouldn’t move.\nWhoa!\n‘Oh?’\nChun Yeowun’s grip on his neck grew stronger.\nThe hand wasn’t stiffened by the shock.\n‘Ugh, this can’t be!’\nFlustered, Lee Taek-yoon struggled and tried to raise his internal energy and strike away the target’s hand.\nCrack!\n“Ugh!”\nHis neck cracked.\nLee Taek-yoon’s body, which was screaming, drooped.\n‘!?’\nThe mobile strikers who were firing noticed something odd.\nIt was because the camera video from Lee Taek-yoon’s helmet looked to the ground.\n‘What? Did the chief pass out?’\nAs a Super Master, they thought he would be alright.\nA member of the 5th team realized something had happened and shouted.\n“Stop shooting! Stop shooting!”\n“Roger!”\nThey naturally stopped firing, plus they had to change magazines anyways.\nAll the lights were broken, and their vision was dark.\n‘Is it done?’\nClick!\nWhen the mobile strikers pressed a button on their helmets, the goggles switched to night vision mode.\nTheir vision turned green.\nThe moment they looked...\n‘No... way...’\nThey doubted their eyes.\nNaturally, they thought their bullets hit the target.\nBut the bullets were floating in the air as if they hit an invisible wall.\n‘N-No way!’\nThe sight of hundreds of bullets floating was terrifying.\nThis wasn’t simple self-defense.\nThose who knew martial arts knew it.\n‘Is he... really a Superior Master?’\nNo, he couldn’t be a simple Superior Master.\n“Ah?”\nLee Taek-yoon was on the floor.\nLee Taek-yoon, who they thought passed out from the pain of getting hit by the bullets, was like a cold corpse.\n“D-Damn it!...”\nA member, Poong-gi, shouted.\nIt was then, Chun Yeowun moved his hand.\nAnd,\nPapapak!\n“Kuak!”\n“Ack!”\nHundreds of bullets floating in front of Chun Yeowun flew in all directions as if he was shooting them from a gun and pierced their bodies.\nThe bulletproof gear was supposed to withstand machine-gun fire and even sword qi.\nYet, they all fell to the floor as their bodies were hit.\nBang!\nIn the CCTV room, a mobile striker, who was watching the scene, hit the desk with his fists.\nShhh!\nThe nine videos from the camera feed went black at once.\nIt meant that the helmets were pierced.\nThe only intact camera belonged to Lee Taek-yoon, whose body was lying limp on the ground showing the dark floor.\n“Damn it, what happened?”\nSong Wei-kang, who was there, asked him.\nHe had no idea what happened.\nHe wanted to hear some kind of an answer when the member in front of the monitor hurriedly radioed.\n“Team A, Team B. Operation failed! Operation failed! Instead, go up to the 1st-floor elevator using the emergency stairs!”\nLee Taek-yoon and the good members were killed.\nIt wasn’t a head-to-head confrontation.\nThere was a problem.\n“Team A! Team B! No, team leader, what’s happening?”\nYeom Chun and both the teams had come up ignoring the radio.\n“Team leader!”\n-Shit, raid the target.\nEnraged by the death of their chief and colleagues, they seemed to have lost their reasoning.\nThat wasn’t right, so even Song Wei-kang tried to dissuade them, but to no avail.\nClick!\nThey opened the emergency exit door and threw the remaining gas bombs into the hall.\nWith smoke, the gas bombs opened.\nWhoops!\nYeom Chan shifted to night vision mode.\nThe cam screen changed to green, and then he opened the exit door and entered the corridor.\nThe other members followed.\n“Shit!”\nThe one watching it through the CCTV room was going crazy.\nDespite his warnings, the teams entered the hallway.\nNow it was a situation where he prayed that these two teams would subdue the enemy without sacrifice.\n‘This time, he’s here.’\nShouldn’t it be different this time? Why the ominous feeling?\nClick!\nAt that moment, the voice of Yeom Chan was heard.\nEveryone turned on Yeom Chan’s camera feed while he was by the elevator.\nIn the middle of the corridor, the target was seen standing right in front of the gas.\nHe was relaxed, close to defenseless.\n-Shoot!\nDududud!\nAlong with the shout, the machine guns fired right away.\nBut then,\n‘!?’\nIn the green screen, the target pulled out a white sword from his waist and split all of the bullets in half.\n“L-Look at that. My eyes seem strained!”\nSong Wei-kang couldn’t help but be shocked.\nThere have been rumors that Murim men could cut down bullets, but they didn’t know it was possible.\n‘... nonsense.’\nEven those of the mobile strike team trained in martial arts were shocked.\nIt was impossible to cut down bullets that moved so rapidly.\n‘Is it possible for a Superior Master to do this? But...’\nMore doubts.\n‘... just how?’\nIt was strange.\nFrom the way he moved, it didn’t seem like the gas worked.\nSince he was a Superior Master, it would take time for the gas to work, but it should still work.\n‘Ah!’\nShrek!\nAt that time, Chun Yeowun suddenly disappeared and reappeared in front of Yeom Chan’s cam.\nAll in the blink of an eye.\nChak!\nThe sound of something getting cut could be heard through the speakers.\nThe scream from Yeom Chan.\n“Accck! My arm!”\nYeom Chan’s cam was moving like crazy.\nMeanwhile, they could see what had fallen to the floor.\n“A-Arm!”\nThe severed arm.\nUnfortunately, that wasn’t it.\nYeom Chan’s headcam turned right and kept turning.\nThud!\n“Kuak!”\nThud!\nThe cam looked to the floor like Lee Taek-yoon.\nNo one said it, but everyone knew that he was dead.\nIt was just the beginning.\nThe people who looked at the screens trembled.\n“Kuak!”\n“Ack!”\n“Kyak!”\nScreams kept flowing in from the CCTV cameras, and the screens all looked to the floor in a moment.\nAll of the hairs on the body began to rise on those who saw that.\n“Kyak!”\nThud!\nWith that, the last member’s cam looked to the ground, and those in the CCTV room stood up.\nIt was because they were scared.\nClick!\n“Uh?”\nAt that moment, the last screen suddenly rose and showed someone.\nIt was Chun Yeowun.\nChun Yeowun looked into the camera and opened it.\nHis voice came through.\n-So there was a camera here too.\nChun Yeowun tapped the cam as if he was intrigued and looked at the ceiling.\n-Are you watching from above too?\nThe faces of those who were looking at the CCTV monitors turned pale.",

      "content": "04:05 AM\nThe CCTV room was in chaos.\nAlthough the job of a Public Security officer is risky, this was the first time they were all feeling the fear of death so directly.\n‘Damn it! If I knew it would turn out like this. I would have left.’\n‘I told them I would stay.’\nExcept for the detectives on duty, the others regretted not leaving the office.\nWhat brought them out of their panic was Kyo-chung, the only unharmed member of the 5th unit.\n“We will have to escape from the emergency stairs at the back of the building, not here!”\n“Y-Yes, I think so too!”\nSong Wei-kang, the chief, who got up, nodded his head.\nIn addition to the two of them, there were four detectives of the 3rd violent crimes squad on duty, and they had already pulled out their guns with scared faces.\nClap!\nThe team member with a machine gun next to the monitor stood and said.\n“I will take the lead.”\nShh!\nKyo-chung approached the CCTV room’s door and slowly opened it. He pulled out a mirror from his waist and looked at both sides of the hallway.\nAs it was early morning, the light from outside was dull, but everything could be seen, and there was a green light pointing to the emergency passage.\n‘He isn’t here yet.’\nAfter confirming that there was no one there, Kyo-chung cautiously came out of the room.\nThe detectives, including Song Wei-kang, followed.\nThe emergency stairs were near the computer room, the first room in the hallway to the left of the elevator.\n“Shh. We will have to hurry.”\nTatatak!\nEveryone whispered. They moved as quickly as they could towards the computer room with light steps.\nThe hallways were so long that they began to feel resentment\ntowards the government building.\nBut eventually, they managed to reach the computer room.\nWith feelings of fear and impatience, the crew members hurriedly approached the door to open it.\nIt was then,\nDing-dong!\nThey heard the bell of the elevator.\n‘!!!’\nEveryone in front of the computer room went stiff and brought out their guns.\nClick!\nThe elevator door opened, revealing only a shadowy figure because of the dark hallways.\nEveryone’s eyes shook.\nAnd their ears heard Chun Yeowun’s voice.\n“I thought you would have run away, but you were planning on meeting me?”\nTheir hearts pounded loudly.\nClick!\nThe door to the CCTV room opened, and someone walked in.\nIt was Chun Yeowun.\nHis eyes widened as he saw the monitors on the CCTV room’s wall.\nHe did have Nano transfer everything about the current era, but seeing it with his own eyes was different.\n“Having something like this must be convenient.”\nIn his time, there was no other way to watch someone other than tail them.\nCCTV or hidden cameras seemed very useful for monitoring someone and checking out the situation without using trusted people.\nChun Yeowun’s purpose for visiting the room was simple.\n‘Nano. Did you say that everything recorded is stored here?’\n[Yes.]\nIt was to handle the recorded CCTV videos.\nChun Yeowun approached the main PC installed in front of the monitors and put his palm on it.\nZzzz!\nNanoparticles of the Nano Machine came out of his hand and took the form of a glove.\nA metal wire extended from his palm and connected to the USB-X port on the PC.\n-Chuk!\nChun Yeowun’s eyes moved as he looked at the CCTV screens which were sent to the augmented reality.\nThe CCTV footage didn’t just show the building, but the traffic and the nearby buildings, even the buildings of the special teams.\nChun Yeowun turned to the CCTV screen showing people.\n“This?”\nAbout 40 criminals were imprisoned on the second and first basement floors.\nStartled with all the gunshots, they were walking to and fro.\n‘They are locked up. So this Public Security Bureau is a place that catches criminals.’\nChun Yeowun was able to identify the use of Public Security.\nHowever, even though there was such a noisy situation, he was puzzled by the people who weren’t moving, and there was a reason for that.\n‘Hmm.’\nOriginally, he was planning on deleting the CCTV footage.\nLooking at the criminals in the prison, Chun Yeowun smiled.\n04:15 AM\nA dungeon of special people.\nAwakened by the sound of machine guns, the members of the Fire Head gang were bewildered as they listened.\nThere was a reason they were listening intently.\n“Brother. It seems like it has failed.”\n“Damn it!”\nAt the words of the gang member, the bald man with a bloody face, leaning against the wall, seemed annoyed.\nHe was the middle boss of the Fire Head gang, Song Mang-dal.\n“... the boss has failed. I wanted to get out of this damn place.”\nThey misunderstood the situation.\nThey thought the gunshots might have been the members of the Fire Head gang who came to rescue them.\nSon Mang-dal is in charge of drug distribution and money management.\nSince more than half of the organization’s operating funds rested in his hands, it was a fact that the Fire Head gang would come for him.\nFor that reason, the Fire Head gang had actually attacked the buses of the Special Mobile Strike Team.\n“Wait up. Boss. Isn’t there something that the boss can do?”\n“They failed twice. What more can be done! You dumbass!”\nHe would have beaten the gang members in a hurry if he was in perfect condition, but his arms and legs were currently cuffed, so he could only swear at them.\n“I-I didn’t think it through.”\nThe upset members went silent at those words.\nIt was then,\nBeep beep! Click.\n“Oh?”\nThe doors of the locked prison opened.\nThe Fire Head gang members who had given up shouted.\n“Woahhh!!”\nThey wanted to escape from the prison, and their doors were all opening!\nThey searched the office of the special force on the first floor to find the codes to their handcuffs and ran out of the building, becoming free.\nIt was half-past four in the morning, still dark outside.\nThe entire Public Security Bureau was quiet.\n“Why is it this quiet?”\nThe gang couldn’t hide their curiosity.\nIf something like gunshots were heard, then there should be signs of movement.\nBut there was no such thing.\n“Something feels off.”\nSon Mang-dal, who was released from the cuffs, tried to concentrate, but he couldn’t feel a single strand of energy.\nThat was when a member said,\n“It seems like the boss has called for professional help this time. It’s great... cleaning up the problem.”\nSon Mang-dal nodded his head as if it could be true.\nThey didn’t know who handled the task of getting them out.\nThat was when Son Mang-dal heard something.\nTak!\n‘Energy!’\nWhen he turned his head, he looked at the entrance of the building.\nAs if someone was there.\nHe wasn’t sure if they were friend or foe, but if it was a Public Security officer, he had to deal with them before they called for backup.\n“Follow me. Someone seems to be alive.”\nPhat!\nSon Mang-dal took the lead and moved to the entrance of the building.\nLike those who learned martial arts, he was good at killing.\nSh!\nHe pushed through the glass doors but couldn’t hide his shock.\nThe smell of blood hit his nose.\n“Isn’t this the smell of blood?”\n“Didn’t they clean up?”\nThe entire lobby seemed to be covered with the smell of blood, despite the traces being erased.\nSomething was really off.\nAt this time, everything felt ominous.\nTak!\nAgain, the sound of footsteps.\n[Over there.]\n[Yep.]\nAt the sound, Son Mang-dal and the other six approached the place.\nIt was dark as the lights were off, but the green light from the emergency exit sign at the end of the hallway helped them.\nPassing the lobby, they reached the hallway near the elevator.\nShhh!\nSomething strange seemed to have touched the soles of their feet.\nThose members, who thought it was odd, touched the floor and then smelled it.\n“Blood?”\nIt was blood.\nThey thought it was odd and looked down.\n“Shit!”\nFor a moment, they ended up screaming.\nIn front of the elevator were ten mobile striker corpses.\nIt was as if they were baptized by bullets.\nThey thought the boss would have planned to clean up the bodies, but that didn’t seem to be the case.\n[Well, it’s strange. Let’s just leave the building...]\nIt was then.\nPapapaang!\n“Kuak!”\nSomething suddenly flew through the body of a member.\nOne of them screamed in pain, which seemed to end his life.\n“T-Trap! Run away...”\n‘!?’\nSon Mang-dal and the members who were near the hallway were startled by the shouts.\nPak! Tatatak!\n‘Damn it! We’ve been played!’\nRight, things couldn’t have been so easy.\nSon Mang-dal and the others rushed out of the office, thinking they shouldn’t be caught up in what was happening to those near the exit sign.\nFrom the glass at the building’s entrance, a black shadow with long flowing hair seemed to be watching them.\nAs the people disappeared, so did the black shadow.\nDing-dong!\nThe LED light with the floor number the elevator was on stopped at five.\n06:10 AM\nEarly morning when there are few vehicles on the road.\nA black sedan was moving fast.\nA man in his mid-thirties wearing a neat suit and sitting in the back of the car talking into his smartphone, he was Jo Yu-seong.\n“Yes. Yes. Director. Thank you for taking care of my request at such an unreasonable time. See you in the office by 10.”\nBeep!\nWhen the call disconnected, Jo Yu-seong wrapped the phone around his wrist with a satisfied expression.\nHe was tired because he couldn’t sleep a wink last night, yet, the results were satisfactory.\n‘Now, we need to bring him out.’\nAll the preparations were done.\nFrom documentation to identity preparation.\nJust the thought of getting it done within 12 hours was amazing.\n‘What time is it?’\nJo Yu-seong turned to the monitor on the headrest of the car’s driver seat.\nAs the TV screen had something playing, the time was shown on the upper right corner.\n06:12 AM\n‘I managed to make it on time.’\nHe told Chun Yeowun he would be there at 6.\nBy the time he arrived at the Public Security building, he thought it would be around 6:30 or so.\nHe thought Chun Yeowun would be understanding.\n-Breaking News.\nThat was when a male newsreader on the TV screen was talking about Breaking News.\nThe channel was in Shenyang City.\nThere was no time for news, but he decided to see what happened since it was emergency news.\nThe man delivered the news with a stiff face.\n-We have unfortunate news. Around dawn, the authorities announced that Son Mang-dal and the other members of the Fire Head organization who were arrested for drug sales escaped from the Public Safety Bureau.\n“Huh?”\nJo Yu-seong frowned.\nIt had to be a coincidence that such news came out at a time like this.\nHowever,\n-In the process of escaping, the Fire Head organization ended up killing around 30 Mobile Strikers and detectives of the Violent Crimes Squad...\nAlong with those words, the CCTV footage was shown on the screen.\nIt was the scene where the Fire Head gang members entered the building.\nAlong with that, it seemed like gunshots followed.\n“Huh...”\nThat was what the CCTV footage showed.\nThe screen switched, and the scene of the emergency conference was shown.\nIn front of the podium, a man with sparse grey hair, who looked like the director of the Public Security Bureau, was giving a report with a stiff face.\n-After escaping, Son Mang-dal and the others destroyed the data in the CCTV room. The violent crimes chief, Song Wei-kang, was killed as he was fleeing with the video copy of the crimes. The Public Security Bureau will not ignore this...\n“Ugh, what is this...”\nJo Yu-seong, who was watching the news, was stunned.\nJust what happened at the Bureau in 12 hours?",

      "content": "06:10 AM\n5th floor of Shenyang Hospital, in a ward.\nThere was a man lying down with a haggard face.\nIt was Lee Myeong, the leader of the 3rd squad.\nAs the emergency room surgeon said, he underwent thorough examination, and even though he suffered gunshot wounds, he only needed a week to recover.\n[Since there’s no infection and you’ve received regenerative treatment, you can return to work after a week of rest in the hospital.]\nAfter a week, he would be discharged and asked to work at a desk.\nHe was called lucky.\n‘Ah... shut up.’\nThe sound of a TV playing loudly annoyed him.\nHe couldn’t tell them to turn down the volume because he shared the room with 6 other people.\nAnd the room was mostly filled with elderly people.\n‘Not a single person is asleep.’\nThe elderly women and men were all awake.\n‘Damn it. I have gunshot wounds. At least put me in a single-person room!’\nHe groaned.\nAs soon as a week of rest was put down, he was put into a multi-person ward.\nCrck!\nHe moved for food.\nAfter not eating last night and getting treatment, he woke up at dawn because of sleeping on an empty stomach.\nA nurse entered.\n“How is everyone feeling?”\nLee Myeong asked the nurse.\n“When can I have a meal?”\n“Ah. Meal? Give me a second.”\nThe nurse looked down at the chart.\n“If the doctor comes for his rounds and then declares you are in good condition, I think you will be given porridge.”\n“Ugh.”\nLee Myeong looked like he was going to die.\nHe was starving, and he couldn’t wait until lunch.\nHe knew he shouldn’t, but he still asked.\n“Then, can I smoke...”\nThen, he heard it from the TV.\n-Breaking News. We have unfortunate news. Around dawn, the authorities announced that Son Mang-dal and the other members of the Fire Head organization who were arrested for drug sales escaped from the Public Safety Bureau.\n“What?”\nLee Myeong’s face stiffened.\nOn the screen, the director’s press conference began, starting with CCTV footage.\n-... Song Wei-kang, was killed as he was fleeing with the video copy of the crimes. The Public Security Bureau will not ignore this...\n“Damn it!”\nThe news of the escape was absurd, and his direct boss had died.\n‘What the hell happened?’\nSomething happened within the 12 hours of him being hospitalized.\nLee Myeong jumped up out of the bed.\n“Patient!”\nThe nurse panicked.\nPushing her aside, Lee Myeong spoke.\n“I need to be discharged immediately.”\n“That can’t...”\nPak!\nDespite the nurse’s words, Lee Myeong pulled the infusion needle out of his arm.\nHe staggered out of the room while blood dripped from the spot where the needle was inserted.\nThe nurse shouted.\n“Patient Lee Myeong!”\n06:45 AM\nShenyang City Public Security Bureau.\nThe gate wasn’t even opened, but the atmosphere of the Public Security Bureau was close to a funeral home.\nAnd the staff which belonged to it were summoned early to deal with the situation.\n“Oh my! Oh my!”\n“Wail. Wail.... Does it make sense that I can’t even see the body of my husband after being told the news?”\nThe families of the deceased were crying and wailing in front of the office. Due to how the bodies were being sent to autopsy, they weren’t shown to the families.\nOriginally, civilians would need to give permission for an autopsy, but when police risk their lives, they receive an autopsy right away.\nThe access to the bureau was blocked with a tape prohibiting the entry of the families.\n“Was that the only CCTV footage, or is the bureau hiding something?”\n“Why are they controlling the press?”\nReporters were gathered outside.\nAfter the press conference, the reporters of each media group came to ask numerous questions.\nAnd because of them, the people of the bureau who were summoned in the morning were having a hard time.\n“Once the results of the investigation are released, an announcement will be made to the press. Until then, reporters! Step back!”\nThe police, controlling them, shouted.\nDespite repeating the same line for the last 30 minutes, the reporters showed no signs of backing down.\nThat was when a reporter shouted while pointing to a black sedan entering through the side driveway.\n“I don’t get it. You said that no one should pass except for the people related to it, then that car which doesn’t even belong to the bureau. Why did you let it in?”\n“What is this? Let us in too!”\nThanks to one person’s scream, the other reporters shouted.\nThe police officers who were blocking the reporters were shocked.\nMeanwhile, on the 1st floor of the bureau.\nSomeone was looking at the confused faces of his men.\nThe man with sparse grey hair was Sang Yu-geun, the Director of Shenyang City Public Security Bureau.\nHe looked at someone and spoke.\n“So what you want to say is that the Fire Head gang and the person in the interrogation room in a weird costume are on a team? Deputy Director?”\nHe was talking to Ho Il-kyung.\nHis posture while sitting on the sofa was extremely uncomfortable.\nA doctor from the medical team who came to work early relocated his shoulders and bones, which were dislocated, but it was just a temporary measure because his cartilage was damaged.\nHowever, he was the only survivor of the night. He couldn’t even go to the hospital because he was called for interrogation.\n“Didn’t I say that before? Director. The 5th team was ordered to isolate that Murim...”\nStep! Step!\nThe sound of the director’s shoes.\nWith a small light beam, a 3D image began to appear on the table.\nThe CCTV footage of the 4th and 5th interrogation rooms in the basement.\n“Oh?”\nIn that video, Ho Il-kyung was sitting on a chair in the interrogation room as if he lost his soul.\nDrool! Drool!\nAnd he was snoring too!\nHe was told that all of the footage was deleted, but that didn’t seem to be the case.\n‘Do I sleep like that?’\nEven he couldn’t understand how he slept peacefully amid the chaos.\nFlustered, he tried to explain.\n“Di-Director...”\nBang!\nDirector Sang Yu-geun slammed the desk with his fist.\n“There are a total of two CCTV images of chief Song Wei-kang! It’s this video and then the one given to the media. I can’t show this video to the media because the prestige of the bureau will fall. Do you understand what I’m talking about?”\nHe could.\nThere was a USB in Song Wei-kang’s mouth.\nWhich made the officers guess that the accident occurred when Song Wei-kang was running away with the USB.\nThanks to that, Song Wei-kang was being praised.\n“Even the head of the violent crimes, who was such an honest man, made such sacrifices. Does it make sense for the Deputy Director of Public Security to be sleeping inside the interrogation room?”\n“Ah, Director. You’re mistaken! It’s...”\n“I don’t want to hear it! After the interrogation by squad 3 is done, there will be an indefinite suspension until the higher-ups give any instructions.”\nAt that, Ho Il-kyung jumped up.\nAnd hurriedly knelt in front of the Director and spoke with teary eyes.\n“Director. You’re really mistaken. Look at me. My shoulders and arms are gone. I was caught by the Murim warrior, and I suffered all kinds of humiliation...”\nKnock! Knock!\nThen someone knocked on the door.\nSince the Deputy Director was in the room, the director said,\n“I don’t know what it is, but come back later.”\n-Director, this is urgent.\nSaying that it was urgent allowed the man to come in.\nIn the meantime, as if nothing happened, Ho Il-kyung went back to the sofa nonchalantly and whistled as he looked to his right.\nA male detective hurried into the room with an envelope.\n“What is urgent... hm?”\nThe Director’s expression stiffened at the mark of Shenyang City Hall on the documents which were taken out of the envelope.\nAt the bottom were a name and seal.\nAt the same time, in the Public Security violent crimes squad room.\nOn the sofa was a man in a neat suit having coffee.\nIt was Jo Yu-seong who promised to get Chun Yeowun out within 12 hours.\n“Phew.”\nThere was a man in his early forties with a beard in front of him.\nHe was Oh Yu-bong, the 1st team leader of the violent crimes squad.\nOh Yu-bong spoke to Jo Yu-seong, who was drinking coffee.\n“I see there’s something you want to believe in. Will you wake up from that dream? As you know, the current situation isn’t that good, and our director is a wonderful man who does not give in to external pressure or any kind of request. It will not go your way.”\nIt was because Jo Yu-seong brought an official letter requesting the release of ‘that person’ who was imprisoned in the interrogation room.\nHe even brought a lawyer from a well-known law firm in Shenyang City.\n“I know right. Let’s wait and see.”\nJo Yu-seong smiled.\nTeam leader Oh Yu-bong clicked his tongue, looking at how the man was speaking provocatively.\n‘That young man.’\nBut this time, Oh Yu-bong knew that things wouldn’t happen the way the man wanted them to.\nThe current situation of the bureau was messed up, but the person in the interrogation room was someone the City Hall ordered them to investigate.\nSo why would they want the man to leave?\n“Huh. Are you done with your coffee? Pack your papers, and let me escort you out. It’s hard with all the reporters and the barricades...”\nIt was then.\n“Team leader!”\nThe detective who was sent to the director’s office came back into the room.\nBut that wasn’t it.\n‘Why?’\nDirector Sang Yu-geun followed him.\n“S-Salute!”\nOh Yu-bong immediately got up and saluted.\nSang Yu-geun lightly nodded and looked at Jo Yu-seong.\n“Chief Jo. It has been a long time.”\n“Have you been well? Director, you must have been working hard. Sorry for suddenly coming in.”\nJo Yu-seong got up and bowed.\nJudging from their conversation and the tone, it seemed they were acquainted.\n“I apologize in advance for not being able to properly entertain you in this situation. But fine. Was the request letter written by Director Yoon?”\n“That’s right.”\n“I brought the seal, so let’s get this moving.”\n‘What?’\nOh Yu-bong was shocked.\nHe thought his director would never accept that request.\nBut this was something he never expected.\nThe director came down to his room to approve the letter.\n‘What the hell...’\nWhile he was shocked, Jo Yu-seong looked at him and smiled.\nA smile which said that he won.\nDing-dong!\nThe elevator door opened, and Chun Yeowun appeared along with Oh Yu-bong.\nJo Yu-seong, who was waiting in the lobby, bowed to the man.\n“You have been through a lot. Mr. Mu-seong.”\n“Mu-seong?”\nJo Yu-seong sent a message to Chun Yeowun, who was puzzled.\n[I didn’t know your name while creating the ID, so I put a temporary name. Once you let me know your actual name, we will edit it.]\nChun Yeowun nodded.\nBut on the inside, he thought it was a clever name.\nThe temporary name he was given was similar to his descendant’s name, Chun Mu-seong.\n“Who’s the one next to you?”\n“This is Lee Hyun, a lawyer at KD Law Firm, who is serving as an advisor at our headquarters. He struggled a lot with the paperwork last night.”\n“I’m Lee Hyun.”\nLawyer Lee Hyun gave a light bow.\nAfter introducing him, Jo Yu-seong pointed to the outside of the building.\n“Let’s get out of this place now, so I’ll take you to the head office right away.”\nAs Jo Yu-seong said, the lobby was full of staff and detectives.\nThey were all conducting an investigation, drawing white lines on the lobby floor, and collecting the blood.\nTo Chun Yeowun, who was about to follow Jo Yu-seong out, the 1st team leader of the crimes squad spoke.\n“Oye, historical costume. I don’t know who you are, but know that this isn’t the end. Be careful. I, the 1st team leader of the violent crimes squad. Oh Yu-song is warning you.”\nIt was a warning as he was leaving.\nWhen Chun Yeowun tried to speak up, Jo Yu-seong and the lawyer said there was no need to deal with the man and led him to a black sedan.\nEven when Chun Yeowun got into the car, Oh Yu-bong stared at him with an angry goblin-like face.\nThe car door closed, and Jo Yu-seong, who was sitting next to him, calmly said.\n“You have been very patient. Many eyes are watching you, so it wouldn’t look good if you got into an argument with the leader of the violent crimes squad within the bureau...”\nThat was when Chun Yeowun, who was looking out the window, pretended to grab something.\n“Ugh!”\nOh Yu-bong, who turned around to enter the building, grabbed his stomach and fell down.\nThe investigators were shocked and tried to support him.\n‘This...’\nNo matter how you looked at it, it must have been something Chun Yeowun did.\nFlustered, Jo Yu-seong told the driver.\n“Start the car. Let’s go.”\nThe quick-witted driver started the car and stepped on the gas.\nWhen they got on the road after barely passing through the barricades and the reporters, Jo Yu-seong took a deep breath and said,\n“I understand your feelings, but if you do tha...”\n“What time is it?”\n“Huh? What time?”\nJo Yu-seong, who was about to speak, went stiff at Chun Yeowun’s question.\nHe was puzzled, thinking that Chun Yeowun would hold him accountable for being late.\n“If it’s because of the promise I made, I apologize. I tried to deal with it as quickly as possible.”\nJo Yu-seong touched the smartphone on his wrist.\n[07:17 AM]\n“It’s 07:17. We arrived at around 6, but we had to wait inside for it to get approved...”\n“So many excuses.”\n‘Ha...’\nAt Chun Yeowun’s cold words, Jo Yu-seong sighed.\nWhile working in the Human Resources Department, he experienced many different types of people when recruiting talents.\n‘Is he trying to aim for something higher? He’s a lot smarter than I thought.’\nFor a second, he wanted to ignore Chun Yeowun and walk away, but he invested a lot into him.\nAnd he already reported to the director.\n“Yes, yes. I lost. I can’t help it. Obviously, there’s the thing where I broke the appointment time, so I will tell the director when negotiating your salary...”\nSlash!\nIt was before his words even finished.\nThe flexible smartphone that Jo Yu-seong had on his left wrist cracked.\nIn the moment of shock, his left wrist had fallen on the car’s floor.\n“Kuaak!”\nJo Yu-seong screamed in pain.\nIn his usual cold voice, Chun Yeowun said,\n“I was trying to tone it down, but you talk a lot.”\n“Haa... haaa...”\n“Since you said you worked all night for me, I ended this with your wrist and not your arm.”\nChun Yeowun’s way of showing mercy.\nHowever, Jo Yu-seong couldn’t say anything.\n‘Ugh, he... really cut...’\nHe regretted not taking the warning seriously.",

      "content": "“KUUAAKKK!”\nA scream filled the car.\nThe driver and lawyer Lee Hyun, who were in the front seats, couldn’t hide their shock.\n“Ah, no! Wh-What are you doing?”\n“Chief!”\nThey couldn’t understand Chun Yeowun's actions as they didn’t know about the 12 hours promise.\n-Kiik!\nThe driver hastily hit the brakes, moved into the road’s shoulder, and stopped.\nThe driver turned back with a rage-filled face and tried to yell at Chun Yeowun.\n[Shit. Don’t bother. Let’s go to the hospital.]\nJo Yu-seong beat him to it and sent a message to the driver.\n[Ha, but chief! Isn’t he insane?]\nShockingly, it looked like the driver was also trained in martial arts.\nThe driver responded in an enraged tone.\n[But, chief, you went through so much trouble all night to get him out, why would he cut off your hand?]\n[I told you it's enough. Start the car!]\nThe driver hesitated for a moment and looked at the pale face of Jo Yu-seong, and grabbed the steering wheel.\nThere was no need for him to make Jo Yu-seong, who was in pain, angry.\n‘I looked down on this man.’\nAs the driver thought, Jo Yu-seong was suppressing his anger too.\nIn the beginning, he couldn’t compete with his skills and couldn’t even speak out due to the hasty process of recruiting Chun Yeowun.\n‘… a warning.’\nJo Yu-seong thought that this was Chun Yeowun’s warning.\nThe price of taking advantage of other people and breaking promises.\n‘… maybe he’s not a sect-oriented person.’\nIf he had been a sect-oriented person, there was no way he could act so cold-hearted.\nEven then, Jo Yu-seong decided to proceed carefully in the future, considering that this man wasn’t an ordinary person.\nTatatak!\nAs the pain became tolerable, Jo Yu-seong pressed on his left arm’s blood points.\nThe blood, which was gushing out, stopped flowing.\nJo Yu-seong took out a handkerchief and wrapped it around the cut part.\nAnd then tried to pick up the severed hand which was on the car’s floor.\nFloat.\nThe hand floated and landed on the seat.\nJo Yu-seong was shocked.\nHe felt it at first sight, but it seemed like he was more than a Superior Master.\n‘Phew. I need to talk it out.’\nThey were already on the way to the hospital, but Jo Yu-seong decided to ask for Chun Yeowun’s understanding.\n“… thank you. I apologize again, but before we go to the head office…”\nChun Yeowun answered before he finished.\n“Don’t worry about it, and stop by the hospital.”\n‘!?’\nFor a moment, Jo Yu-seong was confused.\n‘I remember saying it telepathically…’\nThere was no way one could hear the telepathic messages of others.\nJo Yu-seong, who thought that it was strange, dispelled his doubts.\n‘But.’\nIf he thought about it, isn’t it a normal reaction to head to the hospital after someone’s wrist was cut off?\nHe decided that he was overreacting.\nShenyang City Public Security Bureau.\nViolent crimes squad 3\n“No. What kind of bullshit is this?”\nThe man, whose voice was so loud that it could be heard outside the office, belonged to Lee Myeong, the team leader of the 3rd squad.\nDetective Dan Young-hyeon, a short-haired female detective with bruises on her face, spoke to the team leader by making silent gestures.\n“Shh! Team leader, please lower your voice.”\n“Do you think I can control myself! Kuak… damn it!”\nLee Myeong held his throbbing shoulder.\nIt had been only a few hours since he got treatment, so the pain remained.\nThe attention of all the people in the 3rd squad was diverted to Lee Myeong.\nIt would be strange if they weren’t worried for the man who had been shot and ran into the office wearing a hospital dress.\n“Firstly, team leader. You’re hurt, so please go back to the hospital. We just finished the interrogation, so we also only noticed that now, but there’s nothing we can do.”\nDan Young-hyeon tried to comfort him.\nShe could understand why Lee Myeong was angry, but there was nothing they could do about it.\nThe incident was so significant that every personnel was needed, and even the Special Department of the Liaoning province’s Public Security was sent.\n“In the end, it’s the task for the special team…”\n“Special team? My foot! Including the chief, at least eight people from our department have died! How can this be those bastards’ task! Does it make sense to release the most likely culprit just because of external pressure?”\nShe let out a sigh at Lee Myeong’s outburst.\nBecause of his stubbornness, Lee Myeong was known to be the dumbhead in the Public Security Bureau.\n‘Haa. It’s starting again.’\nBut she didn’t hate him.\nAlthough he had a wild mouth and didn’t follow the rules, he was still a kind and loyal man.\nOf course, that was something only the detectives of squad 3 thought.\nLooking at the other detectives, the female detective said.\n“Once again, the team leader is acting like this. Take him to the hospital and…”\n“I’ll talk with the director myself!”\n“Huh?”\nWith those words, Lee Myeong got up from his seat and sprinted outside the office.\nThe bewildered detectives blocked him, but,\nHe overpowered them.\nThud!\n“Shit!”\n“Ouch!”\nThe male detectives were knocked down with a simple push.\nLee Myeong is a famous martial artist on the team, but he was too strong for a man who suffered from a gunshot wound.\n“Are you trying to hurt the patient? And you, do some exercises.”\nWith those words, Lee Myeong ran out of the office.\n“Shit! Hey! Hurry up and catch the team leader!”\nThe detectives of squad 3 were bewildered and followed him.\nBut Lee Myeong was so fast that he managed to reach the front door of the director's office.\nEven though the female secretary stopped him, he still went into the room.\n“I’m telling you not now. He’s on a business call right no…”\n“Director!”\nDirector Sang Yu-geun, who was on a call, frowned at the sudden actions of Lee Myeong.\nActually, he wasn’t shocked.\nIt wasn’t the first time this happened.\nLee Myeong would directly rush into the director’s room or deputy director’s room whenever something didn’t make sense and even call them cowards.\n“… moved to University Hospital? I get it. For now, keep your eyes open and watch everything.”\nBeep!\nHe immediately ended the call.\nThe female secretary who followed grabbed Lee Myeong’s arm and tried to drag him out.\nThat was when the director got up from his seat and gestured that it was okay.\n“Secretary Lim, you can leave.”\n“Ah, I understand.”\nWhen the lady closed the door and left, the director opened his mouth with an unpleasant expression.\n“What are you doing? How many times have I told you to not barge in?”\nIf it was any other detective, they would have been flustered, unable to do anything.\nHowever, this man, Lee Myeong, is dumb-headed.\n“The chief is dead! Director.”\n“… so, what do you want?”\n“Is the director really going to talk like that! If you act like this, how can Public Security be run?”\nWith a disappointed look, he continued.\n“If you have received an interrogation report from my team members, won’t you know? Regardless of the CCTV footage, only two people survived. If you think with common sense, he’s likely the culprit! If there are no problems after the investigation, it would have been right to let him go, but that isn’t the case here.”\n“…”\nLee Myeong shook his head at the director, who said nothing.\n“I respect the director. A true public security officer never gives in to pressure. But in the end, I think I’ve realized that you are the same as everyone else.”\nLee Myeong, who said everything he wanted, turned to leave the office when the director stopped him.\n“Stop.”\nLee Myeong stopped, wondering what the man had to say.\n“Do you see me as someone who would succumb to external pressure and release someone?”\n“Sorry?”\nThe director turned the monitor on his desk towards Lee Myeong.\nWhat Lee Myeong saw made his eyes shine brightly.\nShenyang City University Hospital.\nInside the orthopedic medical examination room.\nA middle-aged doctor who was examining the severed left hand sighed.\n“Phew… was this really caused by a blade?”\n“… roughly similar. But, why are you asking?”\nJo Yu-seong was puzzled by the doctor’s question.\nThe doctor enlarged the cross-section of the arm.\n“Ahh…”\nThere were two photos of the left hand and left arm on the monitor, which had been perfectly cut off.\n“Even if it was caused by a blade, the human muscles and bones are so tough that the nerves and blood vessels become haggard and distorted, but that isn’t the case here. The cut is so clean as if they were anatomical specimens.”\nThat was why the doctor was surprised.\nAt that, even Jo Yu-seong admired Chun Yeowun.\nBecause he used internal energy, he assumed that he had excellent swordsmanship, but he didn’t expect it to be that amazing.\n“If this is the case, I think we can proceed directly with a single-sided junction regeneration surgery without surgery to align nerves.”\nConjugation of the severed parts is a complicated process.\nIt isn’t a single operation, but several operations. However, the doctor said that only joint surgery and regenerative treatment were needed.\n“After the operation, you will be hospitalized for three days, and if the result is good, you will be able to use your fingers like before.”\nThere couldn't be more fortunate news than that.\nIt would be nice to have surgery done right away, but there is still work to be done.\nDespite the doctor’s recommendation to have surgery at noon, Jo Yu-seong asked for it to be held late in the afternoon and only received first aid.\nAs Jo Yu-seong left the room, the nurse whispered.\n“Doctor, he’s a martial artist, right?”\n“Indeed, as expected of a nurse who worked here for 8 years.”\nHe worked in orthopedics, so there was no way he was unaware of such wounds.\nThere wasn’t a single person who would be that calm if their hand was cut off except for Murim warriors and Gate Keepers.\n“If not from a martial artist, how can a cut like that happen. Hohoho.”\nThe middle-aged doctor, who looked at the monitor and saw the cut, smiled.\n“Well. That martial artist who did that must have been through a lot too.”\nAt the same time.\nThe lobby of the hospital.\nAn old man with white hair was sitting in a chair waiting to be called.\nCompared to the wrinkles, the way the man sat with a straight back was unusual.\nAnd instead of a cane, the old man held a green sword.\nLooking at how heavily it was decorated, one could see that it wasn’t an ordinary stick.\n‘Woah. He’s a warrior.’\n‘That old man. Is he a Murim warrior?’\nNo matter who looked at it, the old man was a Murim warrior.\nPerhaps, he was accustomed to it. The old man seemed to be okay with all the attention.\nThat was when someone rushed over to him.\nA man in his late thirties, dressed in a dark blue suit, greeted the old man with clasped hands.\n“Moyong Yi-sun greets, elder Peng.”\n“Oh-oh. Moyong.”\nThose who knew even a little about Murim would have been shocked by those names.\nThe direct descendants of the Moyong clan and the Peng clan, two of the five great clans of the Forces of Justice.\nOf course, things like clans aren’t used anymore.\nThe man in his late thirties, Moyong Yi-sun, was the managing director of the Yeon Company, the largest corporation in Shenyang.\n“Don’t call me by that title. Just call me like you usually do.”\n“Hehehe, is that so? Still, you’re the next president of the company.”\nThe descendants of the five great clans, they frequently got to meet each other.\nMoyong Yi-sun spoke while looking at the number on the table next to Peng Neung-gyeom.\n“I don’t get it. If you had informed me about this in advance, my people would have quickly handled the payment. Why didn’t you?”\n“Huhuhu, that would be too burdensome. I’m here for a simple check-up… ah! Come to think of it, you kept staring at someone as you entered. Do you know him?”\nPeng, who had good eyesight, found that Moyong Yi-sun was looking at a certain someone.\nA man wearing a cast as he injured his left arm.\nIf it was just an ordinary person, elder Peng wouldn’t have even cared about it, but that man was a Murim warrior.\n“Ah yes. He’s a business acquaintance.”\n“Hmm, is that so?”\nIt felt like he avoided getting into details, so elder Peng didn’t pay it much mind.\nBecause it was none of his business.\n“But, elder is really great.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Did you come here because of the Gate Warning? To come get a consultation despite it being taxing for an 80-year-old.”\n“Huhuhu, what kind of wording is that? In a world where the gates are open, if old people like me can help, that’s more than enough…. Hm?”\nAt that time, Peng Neung-gyeom’s face went stiff.\nHe was going to ask Moyong Yi-sun about something, but Peng suddenly moved out of the lobby.\n“Elder!”\nMoyong Yi-sun followed him.\nPeng, who escaped the hospital building, was looking elsewhere.\nThere were a few people.\nWoong!\n“Looks like there was an accident.”\nMoyong Yi-sun, who reached his side, spoke.\nOn the side that elder Peng looked at was a grand RV stopped by a power pole.\nIt looked like the front tire was punctured.\nShockingly, both the front wheels of the car were torn to shreds.\n“Did you come out after hearing the accident?”\nAt Moyong Yi-sun’s question, Peng Neung-gyeom muttered with trembling eyes.\n“I just felt a tremendous energy a moment back. Didn’t you feel it?”\nMoyong Yi-sun’s eyes lit up at those words.\nBecause it was the first time that elder Peng, one of the top 100 martial artists registered in the Murim Department of the Chinese Government's State Council, was shocked like this.\n“Maybe one of them?”\nMoyong Yi-sun pointed to two men who came out of the crashed RV.\nMaybe it was because of the accident, but the two men who got out of the RV had no energy.\nAt that, elder Peng shook his head and said.\n“No. It appeared for a moment and then disappeared.”\nWith those words, Peng Neung-gyeom clenched the sword in his hand.\n‘Did this Peng Neung-gyeom miss a thunder user?’\nHe was the master of thunder.\nThe black sedan left the hospital grounds.\nJo Yu-seong, who had a cast on his left arm, asked Chun Yeowun, who closed his eyes with his arms crossed.\n“By any chance, the flat tires of that RV… was that your doing?”\nChun Yeowun didn’t deny it.\nIt was because Jo Yu-seong had clenched his fist.\nHe knew it, but he still wanted to ask.\nAnd Chun Yeowun stayed silent.\nHe was frustrated. That was when the driver sent him a message.\n[Chief Jo. Even if not for that, I was going to tell you once I confirmed it, but that grey RV. It had been following us since we left the Public Security Bureau.]\n[What?]\nAt those words, Jo Yu-seong’s eyes widened as he looked at Chun Yeowun.",

      "content": "‘And he noticed that?’\nJo Yu-seong couldn’t hide his shock.\nOf course, he couldn’t focus on what was happening around him, thanks to his severed wrist.\nHowever, the fact that Chun Yeowun, who was always looking ahead, managed to notice that meant that he was very attentive.\n‘Is a Superior Master this great?’\nAmong Murim people who are strong, only a handful of people managed to reach the Superior realm.\nTo reach that level, one would have to pass many levels.\nJo Yu-seong has constantly been learning martial arts since his childhood, but he was only able to reach the Super Master Level in his mid-twenties.\nPeople around him said that it was a great achievement, but this young man in a historical costume made him feel like nothing.\n‘He only looks 20 years old...’\nChun Yeowun looked to be only in his early twenties.\nThe world is so unfair.\nIt was hard to reach the Super Master Level in the mid-thirties, even while working for a company.\n‘Because everyone has a role to play.’\nBefore going insane, he decided to organize these thoughts.\nRight now, if he learned the real level of Chun Yeowun, he might die of shock.\n‘So the Public Security is keeping an eye on us?’\nThe director had come and even signed and stamped the request, which was pretty unexpected.\nHe thought it was because of the accident which happened inside the bureau.\n‘Hmm.’\nJo Yu-seong glanced at Chun Yeowun, who had his eyes closed.\nHe didn’t think that Chun Yeowun had anything to do with the Fire Head gang of the Forces of Evil escaping.\nIt was because they were people who made a living selling drugs.\n‘There was pressure from above, but they ignored it.’\nThe director of Public Security, Jo Yu-seong, ended up thinking too lightly of him.\nThe Public Security Bureau was an institution under the State Council.\n‘We’ll have to cut the string before it gets more tangled.’\nWhile Jo Yu-seong was deep in thought, Chun Yeowun still had his eyes closed.\nOn the surface, it looked like he was meditating.\nBut his eyelids trembled faintly.\n[The material has been organized into the brain, it is 100% complete.]\nNano’s voice echoed in his head.\nOnce they were out of the Public Security Bureau, he was able to connect to the WiFi.\nFrom the moment they left the Bureau, Chun Yeowun had Nano organize all the information about the present era.\nIt was missing some things, but the basics were all there.\nAnd after that, Nano completed the task of distinguishing the knowledge of the present and future, which was built-in, and transferred it to Chun Yeowun.\n‘I have a headache.’\n[Because of the large amount of information that has been transferred at once.]\nSince the development of the Internet, this era is called the information age, so the amount of information present was enormous.\nIt was so vast that it couldn’t be compared with the number of techniques and books transferred to his brain in his era.\nIt was natural to have a headache.\n‘My head is all messed up.’\nThe transfer was successfully completed, but he got dizzy when a lot of information was placed into his brain.\nEven for him, who reached the Heavenly Master Level, it was too much to handle.\n‘Hmm, complex social structure.’\nThat was the opinion of Chun Yeowun, who had all the information transferred into his brain.\nThis era was more complex than his time.\nIt was more restrictive in a way.\n‘This society has great resistance to murder or injury.’\nChun Yeowun, who lived in savagery, couldn’t understand it.\nThis era was a world where there were too many restrictions caused by laws, social notions, and morals.\n‘Was the non-aggression treaty broken down into this structure?’\nLooking at the transferred information, the Murim warriors also seemed to live their lives by following the laws and the ideal social structure.\nThe main reason behind that was the fact that Murim warriors were affiliated with the government.\n‘The registration of Murim...’\nSuch a cumbersome system.\nAll Murim warriors had to register with the Murim Department within the government’s State Council.\nOnly then, with a few restrictions, were they allowed to carry a weapon.\n‘... it doesn’t matter.’\nThe Murim Department seemed like it graded Murim warriors.\nIn the past, the Murim people decided on the Five Strongest Warriors, and each clan in the Nine Great Clans had to earn the title.\nBut now, the government which was controlling the Murim would give the grading.\nInterestingly, from a certain point on, the Murim warriors seemed to be obsessed with that too.\n‘Aren’t they just being distracted? Is that why?’\nPerhaps the root cause of it was something called the First Dimension Gate.\nA natural disaster of unknown origin which suddenly occurred 28 years ago.\nHumanity was threatened as unknown dangerous entities jumped out of the gates, which opened suddenly.\nAt that time, the Murim warriors appeared.\nThe Murim, which was considered to be the dark side of society, was revealed through that opportunity, and now everyone was aware of it.\n‘The press, phones with cameras, internet... there are problems.’\nFrom the moment they were exposed to the public, the existence of Murim was no longer a legend.\nIn addition, the Murim warriors couldn’t disappear in the current state of the world, with Gates being opened in succession, starting with the First Dimension Gate.\nChun Yeowun, who was thinking about it all, asked Nano.\n‘Nano. Where are the State Council, the Murim Department, and the Murim Association?’\n[Right. In the case of the Murim Association, public institutions, and certain organizations, there is a limit to the data which can be collected through the wireless internet because they have their own operating system.]\nChun Yeowun frowned.\nMuch of the material he wanted to know was missing.\nThe Murim Association is registered as a Murim office and allowed grading, so ordinary people’s information about Murim was only of the association.\n‘The same with the Dimension Gates.’\nAgain, it was controlled by the State Council to prevent civilians from accessing the information.\nIn some ways, Dimension Gates were more strictly controlled than the Murim Association, and if any material was uploaded on the internet, it was immediately deleted.\n‘So bothersome.’\nIn the end, it meant that he had no chance but to move on from that topic.\nThe simplest way to get information would be to infiltrate those places.\nNo matter how different the system was, its data could be extracted if Nano was directly connected to the main computer.\n‘But everything is vague. We need a more direct clue.’\nThat way, he could decide how to approach it.\nEven though it was a different time axis that Nano had no idea about, there were some commonalities.\nThat being said, not much has changed.\nFor example,\n‘The energy I felt in the hospital.’\nChun Yeowun sensed certain energies while Jo Yu-seong was being treated.\nThe internal energy from a very familiar harvesting technique.\n‘I felt it from someone before.’\nChun Yeowun, who reached the Heavenly Master Level, was able to distinguish the characteristics of energy.\nSomething flashed through Chun Yeowun’s mind, who for a moment recalled the energies.\n‘... Moyong clan, the Peng clan of Hebei!’\nIf he wasn’t mistaken, then the energies he felt had to be of those two clans.\nChun Yeowun was upset.\nIt would have been better to get out of the car and talk to them.\n/strong>\nBut now, he was so far away that he couldn’t even sense their energies.\n‘Still, I got something. The fact that their descendants, the Five Great Clans, are present in this age too, so my cult should exist too.’\nThe information that Chun Yeowun wanted to find out the most was anything about the Sky Demon Order.\nIn order to return to his original era after arriving at an unfamiliar place, rather than struggling alone, he wanted to meet the people of the Sky Demon Order, which were like family to him.\n‘Was it Sky Corporation?’\nIn the future, where Nano was created by his descendant Chun Mu-seong, the Sky Demon Order is called the Sky Corporation.\n‘Ah, right. Nano. Go on that wireless thing and search for the Sky Corporation.’\n[Understood.]\nAt Chun Yeowun’s command, Nano started searching.\nThe search didn’t take long.\n[A total of 7 groups were found.]\n‘7?’\nNot one, but seven?\nBut, Nano’s next words were puzzling.\n[There are a total of 0 Sky Corporations in the Chinese government’s territory.]\n‘What?’\nA world map in the form of a globe unfolded as augmented reality opened up.\n‘Ah...’\nExclamation.\nAlthough the information about it was transferred, it was still strange to see the entire world.\nAt that time, the locations of the Sky Corporations were marked with red dots.\nHowever, none of them existed in the Chinese government’s territory.\n‘... no way.’\nChun Yeowun’s eyes trembled.\nHe thought that the Sky Demon Order existed under the name Sky Corporation.\nHowever, it was strange that it didn’t exist in this place.\n‘Is there anything which was originally in Chinese territory but moved to another place?’\n[No. They are all foreign companies, and the heads are all foreigners.]\nPhotos of people appeared above the marked-up areas.\nNot a single one looked the same as his people. They were all foreigners.\nChun Yeowun was frustrated.\n‘Why?’\nIn this era, traces of two of the Five Great Clans, the Moyong clan, and the Peng clan, were discovered.\nBut it didn’t make sense that the Sky Demon Order was nowhere to be found.\nThe Sky Demon Order, which he led, had the power to engulf the entire Jianghu region. It was greater than the Five Great clans combined.\n‘Is it possible that the cult was destroyed in this time axis?’\nThere was no way of knowing.\nBut if that was what happened, it would be a huge shock to Chun Yeowun, the Lord of the Sky Demon Order.\nChun Yeowun, who was at a loss for words, suddenly thought.\n‘Maybe it’s under a different name?’\nThe time axis is different.\nAnd the level of Murim warriors here isn’t as low as his descendant described.\nThat being said, there was no guarantee that the Sky Demon Order would be the Sky Corporation.\nIf that was the case, it made sense for the previous search to not have favorable results.\n‘Nano. Search for a company where a person with the name Moyong is the head or owner of it.’\n[Understood.]\nThe results were out immediately.\n[A total of 1 company was found with the name Moyong in it.\nA company that has a total of 13 affiliates.]\n‘Ah!’\nAs expected.\nMaybe if things went this way, perhaps he could find traces of the Sky Demon Order.\n‘Nano. Find a company where the owner has the name Chun.’\n[Understood.]\nThis, too, didn’t take long.\n[A total of 108 companies with the name Chun were found.]\n‘What?’\nChun Yeowun was speechless.\nWhen he searched for Moyong, only one company came up, but when he searched for his own surname, so many companies came up.\n‘What the hell is... sigh...’\nToo many, just way too many.\nHe was shocked for a moment but stayed calm.\nAlthough there were more companies than expected, it could be because they had potential.\n‘If we want to shorten the list... how do we do it?’\nThe companies weren’t disclosing their information either.\nThe company he searched for a while back was an automobile manufacturer, and it wasn’t related to the Murim clan.\nThe sedan suddenly stopped.\n“We are here.”\nChun Yeowun opened his eyes at Jo Yu-seong’s words.\nThe black sedan stopped in front of a building 40 stories tall.\nWhen he got out, Jo Yu-seong led him to the entrance of the building.\n“This is our headquarters.”\nEntering the building, a spacious lobby lined with indigo-colored marble was revealed.\nIn the lobby, a 5-meter tall toy stood up in the center.\nThere was an information desk behind it, with the company name written on it.\nSix Road Toys.\nAt Chun Yeowun, who was looking around, Jo Yu-seong said.\n“Six Road Toys. This is our company name. We launched around September of last year, so you may not know us, but as you can see, we started a toy manufacturing business.”\n“Toy?”\nRight, the robot in the middle did seem like a toy.\nJo Yu-seong smiled and pointed at the elevator to the right of the lobby.\n“Our director is waiting. Let’s go this way. Ah!”\nJo Yu-seong, who was about to lead him to the elevator, patted his palm as if he had forgotten something and searched for it.\n“Come to think of it, I didn’t get your full name. I need to introduce you to them directly.”\nWith that, Jo Yu-seong politely handed Chun Yeowun his business card.\n“First, I will introduce myself. Jo Yu-seong, the chief of Six Road Toys.”\nA red and yellow paper business card.\nOn the front was written Six Road Toys, along with the name Jo Yu-seong, a phone number, and another number.\n“You have an analog tick? If you give me your number, I will send you an electronic business card too.”\nSome things didn’t change over time.\nThe business card.\nChun Yeowun knew about it because of all the information which was transferred into his mind.\n‘!?’\nHis expression stiffened.\nSeeing that, Jo Yu-seong smiled and said.\n“You must have been shocked. Were you surprised that we are a new company? Although the Six Road Toys is a new launch, our performance is high thanks to the support of the head office. This is a place you can trust and rely on.”\n“... is this the head office’s name?”\nChun Yeowun looked at the card with narrow eyes.\nOn the back of the business card was the name of the head office.\n[Blade Six]\nThe name of a company in English, a name he would never forget.\nIt was another name of the Blade God Six Martial Clan, who fought for power with the Sky Demon Order and the Yulin.",

      "content": "Blade Six.\nOne of the five largest conglomerates in the current Chinese government.\nAlthough the world’s population plummeted due to the Gates, the Blade Six still boasts overwhelming power and is the number one in the world.\nLast year, it formed a pro-social corporate image and was so well-recognized that it was selected as the number one company people wanted to join.\n‘Sigh...’\nThe information which passed through Chun Yeowun’s mind was basic information about the Blade Six.\n‘... Blade God Six Martial Clan.’\nAll the information was ordinary.\nHowever, the Blade Six he knew was the name of a company from a distant future.\n‘This guy is proof.’\nJo Yu-seong in front of him was proof.\nSeeing that the head of an affiliated company knows martial arts, that must mean he knows about Murim.\n‘... Nano. If the time axis is different, is there any chance that the Blade God is still alive.’\nChun Yeowun asked with a stiff face.\nThe Blade God of the Blade God Six Martial Clan, the head of the Blade Six.\nNano’s voice echoed.\n[It’s possible if the user failed to kill the Blade God before entering the time axis.]\nChun Yeowun wasn’t happy about that information.\nAnother possibility.\n‘I killed him just yesterday...’\nChun Yeowun had killed the Blade God in the Time Jet before falling into this era.\nIf it was his own time, Chun Yeowun would have erased all traces of that clan in a single day.\n‘This is one funny situation.’\nChun Yeowun bit his lip.\nHe couldn’t find the Sky Corporation, but he managed to find the Blade God Six Martial Clan.\nMoreover, he was being scouted.\n“Sir?”\nJo Yu-seong couldn’t hide his curiosity at the sudden change in atmosphere.\nHis reaction was completely different from the one Jo Yu-seong expected from a person about to get hired by a big company.\n“Is there anything that’s making you uncomfortable?”\nJo Yu-seong asked.\nSince Chun Yeowun is an unpredictable character, he was cautious.\n‘Did he have a bad experience with the head office?’\nOtherwise, there wouldn’t be such a reaction.\nChun Yeowun, who had a still expression, spoke.\n“What’s the name of the company’s head?”\nCreepy!\nA low voice filled with energy.\nThere was no way Jo Yu-seong couldn’t feel it.\n‘Civilians won’t be able to breathe in the lobby...’\nIt was shocking.\nIf this man lived his life like this, everyone would have noticed him.\nHe decided to calm down.\n“Ugh, if you can tell me why you’re...”\n“Tell me the head’s name.”\nThe voice, which was making him weak.\nJo Yu-seong, who was so nervous that cold sweat broke out, said the name.\n“It’s Geum Seong-ryong!”\n“... Geum Seong-ryong?”\nChun Yeowun frowned.\nHe thought that the name Blade God would come out.\nThe energy disappeared right away.\nWhhhh!\nJo Yu-seong’s legs, which would have given out if it continued, relaxed.\n‘What kind of life... did he live?’\nHe forgot that they were still in the lobby.\nAfter barely calming his breath, Lee Hyun spoke.\n“I heard that the President of the head office is famous among Murim warriors, didn’t you know?”\n‘What?’\nJo Yu-seong looked at the lawyer with shocked eyes.\nHe spoke with a carefree expression as if nothing happened.\n‘No way... am I the only one who felt that just now?’\nTo live like that, to be able to force enough energy on a person to kill them.\nQi is a kind of energy, but when used in high amounts, others can feel it.\nBut Lee Hyun didn’t feel anything.\n‘... I must have misunderstood. This man isn’t at the beginning of the Superior Master Level. He seems to have reached the end of it.’\nConsidering Chun Yeowun’s age, Jo Yu-seong thought that he must be an entry Superior Master.\nBut it seemed like he was wrong.\nAt that time, Chun Yeowun asked Lee Hyun.\n“What do you mean by famous?”\n“You know that the President of the head office is the vice president of the Murim Association.”\n“Vice president?”\nChun Yeowun’s expression stiffened more at the words vice president.\nThe basic information of the Murim Association, which Nano transferred, naturally popped into his mind.\nThe association consisted of 12 executives, with the vice president and president above them.\n‘The members of orthodox clans?’\nIt was said that the officers of the Murim Association were members of orthodox clans.\nAlthough the names of the executives weren’t disclosed on the website, officials in the Murim Department and other similar fields seemed to know the executives.\n‘Blade God Six, no, Blade Six is working with the orthodox clans? Ha.’\nAmazing.\nThey were by no means orthodox.\nRather, they walked on a path closer to violence.\nIf necessary, they didn’t mind taking hundreds of lives.\n“You didn’t know?”\n“No.”\nAt the words of Lee Hyun, Chun Yeowun shook his head.\nSince he only acquired basic information, he didn’t know this.\n‘He doesn’t know the President of the head office? I guess he really was a hidden Murim warrior.’\nAt Chun Yeowun’s reaction, Jo Yu-seong thought to himself.\nIf he didn’t know the President of the head office, the most prominent figure in Murim, it was speculated that this man must have learned martial arts in a remote place like mountains.\n‘Only, he’s a little out of control.’\nThey couldn’t handle Chun Yeowun.\nAnd Chun Yeowun was so strong that he can control his energy exceptionally.\n‘For now, try conciliating with him, and if it doesn’t work, we have no choice but to leave it to the director.’\nJo Yu-seong organized his thoughts.\n“I... if there’s something that’s making you uncomfortable, I can postpone the meeting to another...”\n“Didn’t you say that we’ll be meeting with the director of this company?”\n“Yes.”\nChun Yeowun still had a stiff face.\nIn the building, there seemed to be more than a hundred warriors.\nAmong them, two seemed to have a great amount of internal energy.\nPerhaps one of them is the director.\n‘Hmm.’\nChun Yeowun looked up and found the CCTV cameras installed in the lobby. There were forty.\nMuch larger than the Bureau.\nWhich meant that the security was tight.\n‘Let’s figure this place out first.’\nIf it was the past, Chun Yeowun would have overturned the entire place.\nBecause Chun Yeowun was the kind to torture people for information and then kill them once he got what he wanted.\nHowever, it was tiring to do that when the Blade God’s existence was neither confirmed nor denied.\n‘I can’t even find my cult. There’s no need to draw attention.’\nChun Yeowun, who knew how the current world worked, decided to lay low.\nOf course, if that didn’t work, he would go back to being himself.\n“Fine. I will meet him. Where should I go?”\n“Ah!”\nAt his response, Jo Yu-seong exhaled in relief.\nThe 36th floor of the Six Road Toys’ building.\nThe other floors were divided into departments and employees, but the 36th floor was dedicated to one person.\nIt was because the owner of that floor had great authority.\nOf course, he wasn’t the only one on the floor.\nFour beautiful female secretaries and 12 security guards were stationed there.\nThe glamorous office had a private bar.\nSwipe!\nThere was a man with white hair in his early forties swinging his golf club.\nThe person who stood politely in front of him was general manager Jo Yu-seong.\n“That is all. Director.”\nThe man was Yun Mun-pyeong, the director of Six Road Toys.\nHe was listening to the report.\nSwipe!\nHe opened his mouth as he kept looking at the golf club.\n“He cut off your hand because you were late?”\n“... yes.”\n“Quite an untamed bastard.”\nYun Mun-pyeong put the golf club into his golf bag and sat down on the sofa.\nHe sat with his legs crossed and drank his glass of whiskey all at once.\nAnd Jo Yu-seong spoke.\n“If we can hold his reins properly, he’s worthwhile. To be honest, if he has such a high level of skill, it’s worth hiring him for the future.”\n“Are you saying that he isn’t a card we play then discard?”\n“... right.”\nSeeing Jo Yu-seong’s face, Yun Mun-pyeong smiled.\n“How can you even think that after he cut off your hand? You must think that he really is useful?”\nIt’s normal to feel ill will towards such a person.\nStill, Jo Yu-seong was speaking objectively.\nThis was the reason Yun Mun-pyeong used him.\n“Good. I’ll take a look and judge him. As manager Jo said, if he truly is a Superior Master, it’s a waste to use then discard him.”\n“Thank you,”\nJo Yu-seong bowed to express his gratitude.\nAnd the director gestured for him to hold a meeting.\nAs Jo Yu-seong left, Yun Mun-pyeong touched his hair and muttered.\n“Tch Tch, manager Jo. This time your eyes were wrong. If he was a Superior Master, I would have noticed his energy the moment he entered the floor.”\nDirector Yun Mun-Pyeong.\nOne of the two Superior Masters assigned to this company.\nIn Yun Mun-pyeong’s mind, only a Superior Master can sense another Superior Master.\nOf course, considering that this kid was someone in his early twenties and talented, he decided to let Jo Yu-seong bring him in.\nShhh!\nYun Mun-pyeong grabbed the jacket, which was on the hanger, and put it on.\nIf it was a meeting, he had to look his part.\nKiik!\nThe door opened, and someone entered along with Jo Yu-seong.\n‘Oh-ho!\nYun Mun-pyeong was shocked.\nSeeing Chun Yeowun in a historical costume was really shocking.\nHe has never seen anyone grow their hair like that in today’s world, except for celebrities.\n“This is Yun Mun-pyong, the director.”\nJo Yu-seong introduced him.\nAnd although he reported to him earlier, he spoke to the director.\n“He’s the person I mentioned before.”\nChun Yeowun only revealed his first name and not his surname.\nOriginally, he thought about telling them his full name to see the Blade Six’s reaction.\nBut he soon changed his mind.\n‘I can’t give myself away.’\nThis wasn’t even the main company.\nAnd he can’t give these lowly people his name.\nIf the Blade God lived in this era, then there’s a chance that the Blade God would run away to be cautious.\nYun Mun-pyeong reached out for a handshake.\n“Nice to meet you. I’m Yun Mun-pyeong. Since I’m older, I will speak without formalities.”\nChun Yeowun looked at his hand.\nIt was because he wasn’t used to the western greeting style.\nBut soon, information popped into his mind, and he shook his hand.\nAnd said,\n“Yeowun.”\n‘Shit!’\nJo Yu-seong’s face went stiff.\nHe was meeting the director of a company. The kid should at least use honorifics.\nHe looked at Yun Mun-pyeong out of curiosity to see his eyes trembling.\nHe was holding back.\nAs if it didn’t bother him, he spoke.\n“Huhuhu, it seems like the young friend here only learned martial arts and not social norms. I see. For now, let’s sit and talk.”\nYun Mun-pyeong pointed to the sofa.\nYu Mun-pyeong sat on the single sofa with his legs crossed and pressed a button on his phone.\n“I have guests. Bring some hot tea.”\n-Yes. Director\nNot long after, a female secretary in a short skirt came in.\nAfter the cups were set down and she left, the director spoke.\n“Please.”\nHe took a sip.\nChun Yeowun, who looked at him, also took a sip from his teacup.\nThe tea was good.\n“It’s Longjing tea. I like whisky more than tea, but this is an exception.”\nHe put down his cup and continued.\n“You may have heard this in advance. This company loves talented people. Even talented people without a background like you will be treated fairly and justly.”\n‘Ah...’\nJo Yu-seong frowned.\nThere was supposed to be a briefing, but now the director was talking in his own flow.\n“I don’t know if you’ve heard it. I don’t like formalities. And I don’t like to talk about the past either.”\nYun Mun-pyeong reached out towards his desk.\nA tablet on the desk moved towards the sofa.\nHe was trying to show off his skills.\nTuk! Tuk! Tuk!\nAfter Yun Mun-pyeong tapped the tablet a few times, a number was displayed.\n[3,000,000,000 won +a]\nA monetary unit of the Asian union.\nIt was his arrogant way of showing off 3 billion won (~2.6 Million USD).\n“Considering the annual salary of a Murim warrior who has reached the peak of the Super Master Level by the Murim Association’s standards, 3 billion won is higher. And with that, we also give bonuses for completing missions.”\n“Huh? Director. There seems to be some misunderstanding. This person is...”\nWhen Jo Yu-seong tried to correct him the director reached out and stopped him.\nAnd said,\n“There seems to be some misunderstanding because manager Jo has lower skills than you. Even so, at that level, this salary isn’t low.”\nThe director leaned back, pulled a cigarette out of his pocket, and ignited it.\nShh!\n“Huh. If you follow orders well and complete the missions you’re given, I can become your sponsor. Right now, I’m the director here, but once the company stabilizes, I will return to the head office.”\nHe was saying that rather than keeping his position here, he would return to the main office.\nThe Blade Six had a reputation that even a kid would know.\nExhaling the smoke, he asked.\n“How is it?”\nTo him, it was an offer that no one would refuse.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun’s words were unexpected.\n“You seem to think that money is everything. From the start, you’ve talked about missions, but if you want to hire someone, shouldn’t you disclose what you’re doing?”\n“... HAHAHAHA.”\nThe director, who was speechless, laughed out loud.\nAnd said,\n“I see that you don’t know your place. Who do you think pulled you out of the bureau? Even if I treat you this nice, you act arrogant until the very end. Ha!”\nBang!\nAs the director slammed his palm on the table, the marble table split in half and fell.\n‘Sigh...’\nJo Yu-seong sighed.\nAs he thought he would, his director burst out.\n“Well, whether you sign the contract or not, I need to shorten your reins. You did well.”\nWhek!\nAs soon as his words finished, the director tried to grab Chun Yeowun’s throat.\nIt was then.\nGrab!\n“Ugh?”\nChun Yeowun grabbed the director’s wrist.\nYun Mun-pyeong, who didn’t expect that, looked at Jo Yu-seong.\n‘Was he right?’\nFrom the start, he couldn’t sense the kid’s energy.\nEven now, he couldn’t feel any energy from him.\nHowever, noticing and blocking the attack meant that he was hiding his energy.\n‘... a guy in his twenties is on par with me?’\nHe couldn’t believe it.\nHe couldn’t reach the beginning stage of the Superior Master Level until he hit his forties.\nDispleased, he raised his internal energy and tried to shake off Chun Yeowun’s hand.\n“Let go!”\nBut,\nGrab!\nDespite his wrist being let go, he couldn’t move.\nYun Mun-pyeong’s eyes went wide.\n‘He, his internal energy is...’",

      "content": "Even if they were both at the same level, there was a difference in internal energy.\nJust like how a person who reached the beginning of any level is weaker than a person who reached the end of the same level.\nTremble!\nNo matter how much Yun Mun-pyeong, the director, tried, he couldn’t move.\n‘He, is he really at the end of the level?’\nIf so, this opponent is different.\nIt made sense to give in if the gap was certain, but his position was too high for him to give in.\n‘Is this little kid stronger than me?’\nYun Mun-pyeong was a man with great self-esteem.\nHe had pride as a Murim warrior and pride as a member of a large corporation.\nHowever, the young man, wearing a historical costume in front of him, a person whose full name wasn’t even known, was trying to restrain him with internal energy.\nWoong!\nA blue light flashed from Yun Mun-pyeong’s left hand.\nWhoong!\nSeeing that, Jo Yu-seong’s eyes widened.\n‘Sword qi!’\nBeing a Super Master who reached the end stage, it was obvious to him that the man was using qi.\nSword qi at that.\nSword qi was strong enough to act as a sword.\nSword qi is made by condensing qi, and it boosts the owner’s movements. For someone like a Superior Master, it was a raging weapon.\n‘Director Yun must be furious.’\nJo Yu-seong thought that Yun Mun-pyeong would continue the confrontation despite being lifted slightly in the air.\n“You bastard!”\nYun Mun-pyeong stabbed at Chun Yeowun’s heart with his left hand.\nThe eyes of Yun Mun-pyeong, whose self-esteem was broken, could no longer see the talent in front of him.\nHe had to kill Chun Yeowun to feel better.\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun was right in front of him and at a hand’s distance too.\nHe moved at a speed that could kill anyone.\nBut,\nGrab!\n‘!?’\nYun Mun-pyeong’s eyes were about to explode.\nChi-chi-chik!\nThe blue light on his left hand fluttered like sparks and then changed shape.\nThe reason was Chun Yeowun grabbed his hands.\nBut he was shocked for another reason.\n“To touch sword qi with his bare hand?”\nJo Yu-seong couldn’t hide his shock.\nIf Sword qi is touched by bare hands, the flesh will disappear right away.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun’s hand was fine.\n“H-How?”\nYun Mun-pyeong’s voice trembled.\nHe couldn’t understand.\nChun Yeowun spoke to him with the same expressionless face as ever.\n“It isn’t something you can understand at your current level.”\nKuk!\nChun Yeowun’s hands holding Yun Mun-pyeong’s left and right hands clenched.\nScared, the director shouted.\n“Wa-Wait!”\nCrack!\n“KUAK!”\nHe screamed.\nIt wasn’t enough that the right wrist was twisted. The fingers on the left hand were all bent.\nIt was so painful that all the veins on Yun Mun-pyeong’s head were bulging out.\n“Kuak! You dog!”\nAmid the pain, the director swore.\nIt was then.\nWoong!\n“Ugh!”\nYun Mun-pyeong was swept into the air and floated upwards.\nHe wanted to move his body, but he couldn’t. It was as if he was being pulled towards the ceiling.\nUnimaginable energy was trapping him.\n‘Th-This is.’\nEven Jo Yu-seong was startled and jumped away.\nHe never dreamed that something like this could happen.\nIt was the first time he has ever seen someone treat Yun Mun-pyeong like a child.\nShaking!\nThe man’s body trembled.\nFor the first time in his life, he was experiencing fear.\n‘Is this a Superior Master? No, this is a Supreme Master!’\nIt was an unbelievable reality, but he was sure.\nWho could pressure a Superior Master like this with only energy?\nHe looked at Chun Yeowun.\n‘This is odd.’\nHe thought that Jo Yu-seong was mistaken.\nBeing a Superior Master in one’s twenties, he didn’t think it was possible.\n‘Body metamorphosis!’\nBody metamorphosis.\nAt a certain level, a warrior’s body undergoes reconstruction to suit the energy in their body.\nIf that happens, one will look younger, like 20 or 30.\nEven the Chairman of the Blade Six looks like he’s in his mid-thirties.\nDespite being over 80.\n‘Damn it! How is such a man going around with no data on him? I should have guessed this!’\nWhen body metamorphosis occurs, everything from the fingerprints changes.\nIn fact, incidents like this happened in the past too.\n‘But even if he’s a Supreme Master, to do this to me, a Superior Master?’\nHe was skeptical as this has never happened to him.\nBut that wasn’t the point.\nThe question was how to change the current situation.\nCalmly he said.\n“How can a senior treat his junior like this? Start acting like a respectable elder.”\nThe director was certain that Yeowun was a false name.\nTo be honest, he could even take a guess at who he was.\nBecause there aren’t many organizations that are on par with the Blade Six.\n“Are you going to keep your junior tied up like this?”\nSaying that he glanced at the office door.\nHe thought that since he screamed, the president of Six Road Toys upstairs or the security guards would have noticed.\n‘Why aren’t those jerks coming in?’\nThere was no sign of someone coming.\nHe was annoyed when Chun Yeowun said.\n“Stop thinking that someone will help you.”\n“Huh?”\n“No one can hear anything outside the office.”\n“No... no way...”\nThe director looked around.\nNow, he saw the faint glow which enveloped the office.\n‘Shit!’\nFor the moment he entered, Chun Yeowun soundproofed the room.\nNo one outside could hear or sense what was happening in the room.\nChun Yeowun looked around and said,\n“Since there are no CCTVs here, this is a nice place.”\nAt those words, Yun Mun-pyeong’s face contorted.\nHe had a high position, and he didn’t like people invading his privacy, so he didn’t have CCTVs in his room.\n“Answer my questions now.”\nChun Yeowun walked towards him.\nThere was no way that Yun Mun-pyeong could escape.\nBut he had a trump card.\n‘Kuak, fine. If no one is going to come help me, then I can do it myself.’\nThe director bit his lip.\n“Senior. I’m not a stupid person.”\n“You must be pretty stubborn. Seeing that you aren’t discouraged in this situation.”\nChun Yeowun nodded his head.\nIt has been a long time since he’s seen someone speak this strongly despite being in a threatening situation.\nYun Mun-pyeong shouted.\n“One Time’s!”\n“What does 1 hour mean?”\nYun Mun-pyeong was taken aback at Chun Yeowun’s remark.\nThis man didn’t even know what One Time’s was.\nJo Yu-seong, who was uselessly watching from the back, said.\n“It’s a poison made by the pharmaceutical company, D.A.N.G.”\n“Poison?”\nRight.\nThe official name is One Time’s. ⁽¹⁾\nThe pharmaceutical company D.A.N.G was the surviving form of the poison clans in modern times.\nThey were already good at making poison, and then with the introduction of modern technology, they created various types of poisons, and this was the best among them.\nIt was a poison that most people can’t detect, and it stays dormant in the body and activates after an hour.\n‘Kuak, I’m glad I gave you that tea thinking that you might be a Superior Master.’\nAlthough he didn’t believe the report, he wanted to be cautious in case something happened.\nHe informed the secretary beforehand to poison the tea.\nIn fact, because of the lawsuit which the Murim filed against this poison, they managed to get their hands on it.\n“I don’t know if you know about it or not, but it’s a deadly poison.”\nSo this was why the director was so accommodating.\nThe One Time’s stays dormant for an hour, but there was something more terrifying about it.\n“I don’t know if it can be detoxified, but I know that someone like you who’s reached such a high level wouldn’t want their internal energy to disappear.”\nUsually, Super Master’s can detect the poison.\nBut even if it’s detoxified, the poison will consume 30% of one’s internal energy while inside the body.\n‘If you are a Supreme Master, then you must value your internal energy.’\nThe One Time’s created ripples in the modern Murim because of its abilities.\nRecognizing the danger, the Murim association filed a lawsuit against the company. It made sure that they discarded it, or if not, they threatened to destroy the Tang family, as they were still a part of Murim, if they were found making the poison again.\nHowever, even if it was banned, the poison which was to be discarded was used to deal with matters covertly.\n‘It was worth paying a lot of money to buy it.’\nHe bought it thinking that it would help him at some point, and it did.\nWith a smile, he said.\n“There’s no cancellation. After I call them, you’ll be done in fifteen minutes.”\n“...”\n“Ahh. Maybe you’re wondering where my phone is. I don’t have one. My mind can contact them.” ⁽²⁾\nSince he never knew what would happen in the world, he considered it a virtue as a Murim warrior to be prepared.\nIn a confident voice, he said.\n“Kay. If you understand, put me down nicely. And once I’m relaxed, I think we can negotiate again.”\nHe thought that he won.\nThe opponent was a Supreme Master.\nSure, there’s no way the opponent would back down after being this reckless.\nBut he didn’t have another option.\nWho would want to lose decades of internal energy?\n“Kay. I will count to five.”\nHow many seconds would it take for the opponent to break?\nThe situation made the director happy.\n“One.”\nIt was then.\nWith an expressionless face, Chun Yeowun drew his sword.\nSlash!\n“Ah?”\nSomething passed through his right arm.\nThud!\nSomething fell on the floor.\n‘!!!’\nWith a pale face, Jo Yu-seong had his arms tightly against his body.\nShhh!\nBlood gushed out of the severed shoulder.\nThe director’s face turned red as he screamed loudly.\n“KUAKKKKKK!”\nThis pain was incomparable to when his fingers were broken.\nHe only counted to one, but for this to happen!\n“Kuak! You... you crazy bastard, do you think this is okay to do because you’re losing your internal energy?”\n“You are mistaken.”\n“What?”\nAt that moment, he held out his hand.\nSomething like black water rose from his palm, forming round drops of water.\n“Did you really believe in something like this?”\n‘N-No way!’\nThe director was shocked.\nHe really wanted to deny what he was thinking.\nThat was when Chun Yeowun said.\n“Did you think that I wouldn’t know?”\nCreepy!\nThe hair on his body stood up.\n‘No way!’\nIt had to be impossible.\nIf that poison could be easily detoxified, he wouldn’t have paid a huge amount to get it.\n“N-No way! That can’t be done unless you take the antidote.”\n“You wouldn’t want to believe it.”\nWith that, Chun Yeowun stretched out his hand towards him.\nThe black drops of water floated to the director.\n“No! NO! NOOOO!”\nThe director was crying in disbelief.\nHowever, the energy which was surrounding him fixed his head in place and opened his mouth.\nTremble!\n“KUAK!”\nGulp!\nIt entered his mouth and went down his throat.\nHe could even feel it run down his esophagus.\n“KUAK!”\nIf this really was One Time’s, it should be removed right away.\nTwisting, he tried to puke it out, but Chun Yeowun pressed his blood points.\nTatatata!\nHis body went stiff as his blood points were locked.\n‘Kuakk! Shit!’\nIt was like giving him medicine but blocking his access to it by sealing the bottle cap.\nWith red eyes, Yun Mun-pyeong stared at Chun Yeowun, who sat on the sofa with a smile and said.\n“59 minutes left.”\n⁽¹⁾ Yes yes, I know, One Time’s is an awful name, but the author literally writes it out in English “정식 명칭 원 타임즈(One Time’s).”\n⁽²⁾ “My mind can contact them.” He’s saying that he’s going to use telepathy, which we have seen numerous times.",

      "content": "-Senior seems to be leaving.\n-Let’s leave too. Send the blue car behind us first, and then slowly catch up.\n-Yes.\nBy turning the handle, the view of the video slowly moved.\nIt was then.\nPang!\nThe video rumbled loudly with the sound of something popping.\nKiiik!\n-Wh-What! Euk!\nThe camera in the video shook violently, and the screen suddenly shifted.\nThe screen of the video, which couldn’t be balanced even after the immediate braking, showed that the car hit the electric pole at the entrance of the hospital.\nBang!\n-Kuak!\nAs soon as the electric pole was hit, the car’s airbags popped out.\n-Damn it!\n-What the hell!\n-Click!\nWith the sound of the car door opening, two men moved ahead.\nIn the video, the two looked at the car’s front wheels and then at the black sedan which was leaving, unable to hold their anger.\nAnd this video was playing in real-time.\nThe Public Security Director, who looked at the screen, put his hand on his forehead, which was throbbing.\n“How...”\nHe didn’t think they would be found out as it hadn’t been long since they started pursuing them.\nJust by looking at the video on the screen, it was clear that the front tires had exploded.\n‘I went down there on purpose and even stamped it to show a favorable attitude.’\nHe tried to make them believe.\nBut this only made one thing clear.\n‘He’s very important to them.’\nAnd he thought that they had maybe already placed a sniper at the hospital for such things.\nWhich meant that the man they took away needed to be brought back.\n‘Huh?’\nHowever, Lee Myeong, the 3rd team leader of the violent crimes squad, couldn’t take his eyes off the monitor.\nHe was staring at something.\n“Did you find something?”\nAt the Director’s question, Lee Myeong looked away from the monitor.\n“Ah, no.”\n“What were you looking at? Huh?”\nLee Myeong was staring at the man in his late thirties standing at the hospital’s entrance in the video. He was in a navy blue suit, and an old man with a colorful sword was next to him.\n‘He is...’\nDirector Sang Yu-geun frowned and looked at Lee Myeong.\nHe, too, has lived in Shenyang for over 30 years.\nNaturally, he could recognize the face of Moyong Yi-sun, the executive of a large corporation.\n‘Moyong Yi-sun, a director of the Yeon Company, is at the scene of the incident...’\nThe Director knew that Yeon Company was run by a Murim family.\nNow things seem to be more complicated.\n‘Hmm.’\nHe could guess why Lee Myeong couldn’t take his eyes off the video.\nHowever, it wasn’t right for a detective who had done the investigation to get caught up in their personal feelings.\nDirector Sang Yu-geun, who tried to give him another chance, decided to change his mind.\n“The 3rd team leader is on sick leave, so you should focus on recovery.”\n“Huh?”\nLee Myeong was flustered.\nHe was shown the video and asked if he could handle it a second ago, but now the Director changed his mind.\nBiting his lip, the Director stroked his chin and pressed the play button for the video when Lee Myeong said.\n“If it’s because of that person of the Yeon Company, which we had established a rela...”\n“I told you to stop.\n“Director! This job is no longer for just those special forces!”\nThere was no way Lee Myeong would back down.\nShaking his head, the Director picked up his phone and dialed a number.\n“Lee Myeong will be dismissed from his position for a while and suspended for three weeks. Tell the front door security to control his access into the bureau.”\nShocked, Lee Myeong tried to approach him.\nHe never expected this to happen.\n“Director!”\nClick!\nThe Director hung up the phone and said in a cold voice.\n“Did you not hear me? As of now, team leader Myeong has been suspended. Go back to the hospital.”\n“Director! No!”\n“I have nothing more to say to you. Secretary Lim! Secretary Lim! Call security!”\n“Kuek!”\nA force wanted him to be expelled.\nLee Myeong frowned and said.\n“You can’t act like this.”\n“Secretary Lim!”\nThe Director didn’t speak to him after that.\nThe Director of Public Security had suspended him.\nUnable to do anything, Lee Myeong left the office.\nAfter he left, the Director sat in his chair and took a deep breath.\n“Sigh...”\nFrustrated, he picked up a pack of cigarettes which was on the desk.\nThere was something like a small safe under his desk.\n“Nothing can be done.”\nHe mumbled as he reached for the safe.\nTutu! Beep beep beep!\nWhen the fingerprint and password were pressed, the door to the safe opened.\nThere were five small radio-like things in the safe, and the Director took the one on the far right and pressed the button.\n“This is Alpha. This is Alpha. Can you hear me?”\nShortly after, a beep was heard from it.\n-Click! Beta here. I’m listening.\nThe voice of the man on the other side was hoarse.\nThe Director asked.\n“Possibility of wiretapping?”\n-There is none. Just arrived in town.\n“Good job. Team leader Oh. Is the agent you sent ‘there’ still safe?”\n-Click! No problems yet. However, they seem to be psychologically unstable.\n“Right.”\n-Is there still no support from the technical team?\n“...”\nThe Director, who was stroking his chin, pressed the button and spoke.\n“... the technical team is doing their best.”\n-Sigh, Alpha... no, Director. It’s not about them doing their best. As I said earlier, their condition doesn’t seem to be good.\nTeam leader Oh said in a serious voice.\nTo that, the Director said.\n“The Beijing side said that they found the whereabouts of a former MS researcher. I’ll let you know when something progresses.”\n-Click. Understood. But why was I contacted?\n“I’m sending you a file through the secure net, so have an agent investigate that person. It should be there now.”\nWith that, the Director looked at the monitor.\nOn the screen was a picture of Chun Yeowun sitting leisurely in the interrogation room.\n‘This is insane.’\nJo Yu-seong was losing it.\nDirector Yun Mun-pyeong, who was on the sofa with his blood points suppressed, kept trying to say something with his eyes.\nHe could guess what it meant.\n‘Director...’\nHe wanted to help too.\nBut even if he wanted to help, he couldn’t move.\nIt wasn’t that he was being suppressed, but it felt like he would end up like the Director if he moved.\nJo Yu-seong glanced at the clock hanging in the office.\n30 minutes have passed.\n‘... we are running out of time.’\nIf he was this nervous, then the Director must be losing it.\nAccording to him, if the time it would take to get the antidote is included, the Director has 15 minutes until it’s guaranteed that the poison will spread.\n‘Evil bastard!\nJo Yu-seong looked at Chun Yeowun, who was sitting at the desk.\nNaturally, he wanted to suppress the poison, so he thought Chun Yeowun would get something out of the situation and then leave. ⁽¹⁾\nHowever, he didn’t move and kept them from moving.\nThanks to that, time passed, and the Director was becoming more and more impatient.\n‘Damn it.’\nAnd he even used the poison to threaten them.\nThis was torture.\n‘What is he up to?’\nChun Yeowun was at the desk looking at Yun Mun-pyeong’s computer.\nThe company’s computers were protected, so no one else could figure out how to access them, which meant Chun Yeowun was wasting his time.\nOf course, even hackers would have a hard time cracking this account of the Blade Six.\nBut Chun Yeowun had Nano.\n[The search for all files in the storage device has been completed.]\nMultiple PDF files appeared on the screen of the monitor.\nIf those two saw this, they would faint right away.\nAlmost everything was business data, and a few things were related to the Six Road Toys.\n‘No. This material can be excluded.’\nThis wasn’t the material Chun Yeowun wanted.\nHe wanted the Blade Six’s Murim related documents or anything like that.\nNano, connected to the computer, quickly sorted the data and searched for it, but unexpectedly, no materials on Murim were there.\n‘Maybe they have a strict protocol?’\nHe expected to see some when he searched, but this was unexpected.\nIt was as if the Murim material was being kept hidden.\nIf they had kept it in a secure file, Nano would have figured it right away.\n‘... hmm, did Nano say that files are kept in USBs?’\n[Right.]\n‘Then we will have to look for that.’\nChun Yeowun got up from the desk and went near Yun Mun-pyeong.\n‘Is-Is it finally starting?’\nJo Yu-seong, who thought that the conversation would come, turned his gaze away.\nSince Chun Yeowun couldn’t get anything from the computer, now he might talk or use torture on them.\nIt was then.\nWoong!\n“Hmph! Hmm!”\nYun Mun-pyeong, on the sofa, was screaming.\n‘Wh-What is he trying to do?’\nYun Mun-pyeong, who was on the verge of going crazy, panicked as Chun Yeowun came closer.\nNot caring, Chun Yeowun reached out.\nShhhh!\nSomething amazing happened.\nThings that were in Yun Mun-pyeong’s pants and jacket pockets came out into Chun Yeowun’s palm.\nFrom business cards to all the small things.\nPak!\nEven the flexible smartphone on his wrist came off too, so did his ring.\nOnly then did he realize Chun Yeowun’s purpose.\n‘He’s looking for the USB!’\nSince he couldn’t get the data from the computer, he was looking for other ways.\n‘N-No!’\nYun Mun-pyeong was shocked.\nIt wasn’t because his phone was taken away.\nIt didn’t matter, the security application was installed on his phone too, and the important files would be deleted if someone tried to enter.\n‘Please don’t notice it.’\nHe kept praying.\nHe tried to act like he didn’t care, so no more problems would crop up for him.\nThat was when Chun Yeowun threw away almost everything in his hand and kept the smartphone and another thing.\n“Ho?”\nThe small robot figure.\nIt was the size of a little finger, but Yun Mun-pyeong’s eyes shook.\n‘H-How?’\nHe never thought that Chun Yeowun could find it.\n[The figure contains a security card chip. As a result of analyzing the chip’s code, it is used to unlock a device with a specific password.]\nIt was a cute way to trick people.\nWho would think that a toy would be so important?\n‘So this toy is the key to unlocking something?’\n[Yes.]\nChun Yeowun looked around.\nUnlocking something?\n‘How am I supposed to find it?’\n[Place your palm in front of you and slowly turn to the right. I will scan.]\nAt Nano’s words, Chun Yeowun did what it asked.\nSomething like a red laser flashed from his palm.\n‘!?’\nBoth victims were shocked.\n‘Wh-What is this now?’\nIt was a light different from qi.\nIt seemed more like the laser which is used to scan barcodes.\nAt that moment, a strong sound entered Chun Yeowun’s mind.\nBeep! Beep!\nAugmented reality opened up right away, and a place was marked.\nAt the place was a picture frame which was hanging.\nIn it was a picture of Yun Mun-pyeong wearing a suit, and Chun Yeowun walked towards it.\n‘Shit!”\nThe Director was shocked.\nHe didn’t realize that this man had special equipment.\nWhen Chun Yeowun placed the toy in front of the frame.\nBeep! Wheeing!\nThe glass frame opened sideways like an automatic door with a sound.\nInside was a hidden safe.\n‘H-How is that bastard doing all of this?’\nEven an international spy would have a hard time figuring their security methods out.\nBut this man didn’t even doubt anything.\nThe last line of defense was fingerprint recognition and a password.\nOf course, if the man is this skilled, he can open the safe by breaking through, but then security will be notified.\nHe wished Chun Yeowun would do that, but obviously, he wasn’t stupid enough to do that. This man was too smart for them to understand.\n‘Damn it!’\nFor the fingerprint, he could cut off a finger, but the password was something that was in his head, so he couldn’t get that.\nYun Mun-pyeong’s gaze turned to his watch.\nEight minutes left.\nIn the end, there were two choices.\nEither live by giving up the password or keep the secrets and die.\n‘Shit shit!’\nHe kept swearing.\nHis heart was troubled.\nHe always said that he would give his life for the sake of company, but when the moment came, he wanted to hold onto his life.\n‘Director, please don’t do it!’\nJo Yu-seong shook his head.\nIf he decided to hold onto his life and give up the password, something important would be revealed.\nHowever, Yun Mun-pyeong was determined to live.\n‘Fuck! I have accomplished too much to die here!’\nIn the end, he decided to negotiate with Chun Yeowun.\nHe tried to speak.\n“Eup! Eup eup eup! Eup eup eup!”\n‘Me! Look at me! Look at me!’\nIt was then.\nWheing! Click!\n‘!?’\nThe door opened without the fingerprint and password.\nEven more shocking was the security alert, which didn’t ring.\n‘... this can’t be...’\n/strong>\nIt was then that Yun Mun-pyeong decided it wasn’t worth trying to think of any answers.\n⁽¹⁾It’s basically just saying he hopes that Chun Yeowun will get something out of the situation (money, information, etc.) and leave, so they can suppress the poison.",

      "content": "The inside of the safe was divided into an upper and lower section.\nThere was something like a carrying case in the lower part and a single sheet of paper on the upper part.\nIt didn’t seem like there was anything amazing inside.\n‘Is the USB in this bag?’\nChun Yeowun, who was about to open the bag, was concerned with the single piece of paper, so he took it.\nShh!\nAt that moment, Nano’s voice said.\n[Wireless receiving printer and incinerator are detected on the upper part of the safe.]\n‘Incinerator?’\n[When the safe is forcibly opened, fire is emitted, and the contents are automatically incinerated.]\nThe safe didn’t just have an emergency alarm.\nIf forcefully opened, everything inside will be destroyed.\nThe safe has level 1 traps.\n‘... what is a receiving printer?’\n[A device that receives a signal from outside and prints it.] ⁽¹⁾\n‘Is it getting a signal from outside? Can you track it down?’\n[It uses YTD short-range wireless technology, so it can only be tracked when the printer is operating as it is a method that sends and receives a signal within 2 km.]\nSo it wasn’t a long distance.\nIt meant that someone who came close to the company or within it could send a signal.\nChun Yeowun bit his tongue.\n‘... in this era, try to avoid being tracked. This isn’t easy at all.’\nIn the end, in order to trace the one signaling the printer, he had to use the printer.\nHe thought he would have to wait until Nano came up with a solution.\n[I will print the data from the wireless signaling device registered in the printer, and its radio signal can be detected if the person is within a 2km vicinity.]\n‘Ho-oh!’\nThen there was no need to be there.\nIn terms of technology, the 7th generation Nano Machine overwhelms the current era.\nPrinting the data didn’t take long.\nShh!\nChun Yeowun pulled out the paper and looked at it.\nHe wondered what important information would be on it, but there were four things that looked like instructions on the paper.\nAs a result of the requested investigation, the probability of a spy is 80%. Team 7 should be removed.\nSecure the 3rd team leader of the violent crimes squad, Moyong Lee Myeong.\nFrom February 23rd to 24th, Gate 26 warning is scheduled. Be sure to destroy the confidential internal data.\nReviewing the report on the operation to assassinate the executive director of the Yeon Company, which was taken to the upper level. Payment is due before Gate Warning 26.\nAt the bottom were the words Blade Six and its logo seal.\nNow, pretty secret stuff was revealed.\nThe shadow of a pro-social conglomerate was exposed.\nFrom assassination to kidnapping and spying.\n‘So this is what you guys are.’\nChun Yeowun smiled.\nThe Blade Six was the same as their past version.\nThey were wearing the mask of a good guy, who didn’t act out of character.\n‘I got something nice.’\nIf this was released to the world, the Blade Six, including the Six Road Toys, will be severely damaged.\nChun Yeowun folded the paper and put it into his sleeve.\n‘Hm.’\nHe checked the safe, but there was no direct information about the Blade Six.\nChun Yeowun’s hand naturally went to the lower section.\nThere was a lock on the case.\n[Fingerprint recognition needed.]\n‘Is that so?’\nChun Yeowun extended his hand.\nThe severed right arm of Yun Mun-pyeong, which was on the ground, was brought in.\nHe put the thumb of the severed arm on the scanner.\nClick!\nThe case opened.\nChun Yeowun frowned.\nHe was hoping for a USB, but unexpected things were in it.\n‘What is this?’\nChun Yeowun picked up one of the items.\nA syringe, the size of a palm, made of silver metal and thick glass.\nThe liquid inside was blue.\n‘Nano. Do you know what this is?’\nThere was one more syringe.\nOriginally, there were a total of 10, but there were eight empty slots.\n[Let’s scan.]\nA red light emanated from his right palm which was holding the syringe.\nWhen the scan was done, Chun Yeowun’s eyes trembled a little as augmented reality opened.\nThere were a thousand things inside the liquid.\n[These are nano bombs. They have been enlarged so that the user can see.]\n‘Nano... bombs?’\nThe tiny invisible balls inside the liquid were called nano bombs.\nChun Yeowun questioned it.\n‘Nano. So, have Nano Machines like yours been developed at this time?’\n[Although medical nanotechnology is common, it takes another 200 years of technological development to properly secure nanotechnology equipped with AI.]\nIn this era, Nano Machines weren’t developed.\nNanotech was started in 2015, and it slowly reached the level of making simple devices.\nOf course, even if they’re lacking compared to Nano, the nano bombs are still great.\n‘Hmm.’\nChun Yeowun turned off augmented reality and looked at the syringe.\nNear the metal of the syringe, a red ring and a small engraving of the English letters MS were there.\n‘That is the name of the nano bombs.’\nThe English letters MS were engraved on the side of the terminal inside the case too.\nIt must have been the logo of the company which made it.\n‘What is this?’\nAt Chun Yeowun’s question, Nano scanned it.\n[The signal code that triggers the nano bombs is registered.]\nThe purpose of the terminal was revealed.\nA button that detonates the bombs.\nHalf of the terminal was a monitor, and ten little colored buttons were sticking out.\nChun Yeowun pressed the red button.\nPush!\nA red circle appeared on the monitor.\n[Would you like to launch the nano bombs? Y/N]\nThe touch screen indicator appeared.\nIt was showing ‘Y’ to explode the bombs.\nChun Yeowun looked at the syringe he was holding and the other one in the case.\n“Ugh?”\nThe metal part on the syringe had a different color.\nThe terminal could detonate the nano bombs in the ten syringes.\n‘Ah!’\nChun Yeowun understood it.\nIt was then.\n“Eup! Eup! Eup! Eup!”\nAt that time, the bloody cry of Yun Mun-pyeong was heard.\nWhen Chun Yeowun turned his head, the man’s face was wet with cold sweat, and he blinked at the watch.\nChun Yeowun looked at the time and understood why he was acting like this.\n“Ah. One minute left?”\nAfter one minute, there would be 15 minutes before the ‘One Time’s’ poison starts spreading.\nYun Mun-pyeong was losing it.\nIf the antidote isn’t brought within 15 minutes, he will die.\n“Eup eup eup eup! Eup eup eup!”\n‘Pl-Please save me! I don’t want to die!’\nHis wails and eyes were conveying what he was trying to say.\nChun Yeowun stared at him and then approached.\nYun Mun-pyeong was shocked.\nThis was the moment where Chun Yeowun would decide if the man lives or dies.\n‘Please! Please!’\nIt was then.\nPapapak!\nHis blood points were released, and he could move again.\nAnd\n“Ugh! M-My voice...”\nHe even began to lose blood.\nChun Yeowun gave him something with a puzzled expression.\nThe smartphone he had taken away.\n“Call them. And tell them to bring the antidote.”\n“Ugh?”\n‘Even if the safe wasn’t opened, negotiations weren’t made.’\nYun Mun-pyeong was confused then Chun Yeowun asked.\n“Do you want to die?”\n“Ah, no!”\nShocked, the man immediately tapped something and dialed a number.\nIf he didn’t hurry, he could be in danger.\nTutututu!\nThe dial tone.\nYun Mun-pyeong bit his lip.\n‘Answer the call! Answer!’\nThe dial tone was going on for too long.\nAround ten beeps.\nClick!\n-Yes, director. This is Ho Jeong.\nThe face of Yun Mun-pyeong brightened up at the voice.\nA convenience store about 800 meters away from the Six Road Toys’ building.\nThud!\nIn front of the checkout counter, someone put a basket of drinks, sweets, and cup noodles.\nThe female employee started scanning the items.\nIt seemed like it would take a while since there was only one employee.\n“Please do it quickly.”\nThe female employee grunted.\nHe was a handsome man in his early thirties with short shaggy hair and a spot under his right eye.\nHandsome or not, the employee spoke in a dissatisfied voice.\n“Listen here, sir. Because every product is different, it takes time to scan the barcodes.”\n“Please, there are a lot of shady people who want to hurry.”\nThe man pointed to the back where a middle-aged man wearing a grey coat and sunglasses stood.\n“Tch”\nMaybe the man felt the gaze of the woman, he shook his head and went to the shelf where the books are kept and looked at the magazines.\n“If-If you don’t mind, I can put the items in the bags myself.”\n“Yes, yes, yes.”\nThe female employee handed him five paper bags.\nThe young man took the paper bags.\nShh!\nHe put in the items as the woman scanned the items.\nA piece of paper the size of his palm was received by the young man.\nSmall letters were written on it.\n[An application to cancel the mission isn’t allowed. The technical support team is doing their best.]\nThe young man frowned at the message.\nOut of frustration, he crumpled the paper and rolled it over the counter.\nWhen one bag was done, the young man took out another paper bag to put the drinks in.\n[Added a new mission. Investigate the following profile.]\n‘What the fuck.’\nThe young man groaned.\nIt was the third time he requested for the mission to be canceled, but ignoring that, they kept giving him new orders.\n‘How did I end like this?’\nThe young man crumpled the paper and glanced behind him.\nThe man who was looking through the magazines was constantly looking at him.\nHe was being watched.\n‘Haa... I’m going crazy.’\nHe was getting irritated.\nAt first, his smartphone and belongings were inspected.\nBut suddenly two days ago, a team leader stayed with him for almost 24 hours.\n‘Damn. Are they saying that it’s okay if I die? Damn the public security.’\nHe was being watched, so he acted like everything was fine, but he couldn’t take it any longer.\nThe situation was difficult enough.\nAnd now, he was more concerned about how things would go.\nIf it wasn’t for ‘it.’\n‘Fuck. Shit. Cunt!’\nAll he could do was curse.\nAfter throwing away the paper, he put the cookies into the next bag.\nAnd then pulled out the photo inside it.\n‘What? A historical drama?’\nA photo of a man with long hair and old-fashioned clothes.\nIn the middle of the photo, the person’s name was written.\n‘What should be investigated about this guy? Ha...’\nThe young man looked at the photo, memorized it, and rolled it down the counter.\nWithin 3 minutes of scanning, all the information was relayed.\n“It’s 43,520 won.”\n“Yes.”\nHe bought a lot to pass the time, but it seemed like he bought too much.\nThe man used his fingerprint to unlock his smartphone and used electronic pay to complete the checkout at the employee’s words.\n“Team leader. It’s done.”\nThe young man came out of the store with four bags in his arms.\nAfter that, the harsh-looking man called the team leader came out and put his hand in one of the bags, and took out a drink.\n“Why was it so slow?”\n“I bought a lot.”\nThe young man answered with a smile.\nAt that, the team leader tapped the young man’s forehead and warned.\n“Geum Jong-so. I have warned you to not do anything suspicious. Don’t forget that I’m watching your every move.”\nThe young man, Geum Jong-so’s face, went stiff.\nHe was annoyed with the warning but decided not to show it.\n“... understood.”\n“If I find anything a little suspicious, you know what will happen, right? That thing in your body will go boom! Bang!”\nThe team leader gestured as if something was exploding.\nGeum Jong-so’s face darkened.\n‘Damn it! I should have never entered this job.’\nThe regret was overwhelming.\nAt that moment, something caught his eyes.\n“Team leader? A call?”\nLight flashed on the smartphone.\nSeeing that, the team leader said.\n“This. I forgot to turn off silent mode. Ugh?”\nThe call seemed important.\n“Yes. Director. This is Ho Jeong.”\nHis name was Ho Jeong.\nListening, his expression turned stiff.\n“Understood. I will bring it right away.”\nClick!\nHe hung up the call.\n“This is strange...”\n“Did something happen?”\n“No. Newcomers are coming in, but why did he say it like that?”\nNormally, the director would speak calmly.\nBut now, it seemed like he was rushing.\n“... is it because the new ones are strong?”\nGeum Jong-so knew the joining process.\nThe dirty things that the director does.\nDespite Geum Jong-so’s words, the team leader still felt like something was off.\n“Since we don’t know, follow me.”\n“Yes? Me too?”\nIt was a surprise as he never asked for Geum Jong-so to come along.\n‘Ah!’\nIf new ones came, that means the director must have opened that case.\nHopefully, he will be able to see the safe this time.\n“Follow me.”\n“Understood!”\nThey both ran to the car.\nAt the same time.\nThe room on the 36th floor of the Six Road Toys.\n“Right! Hurry!”\nClick!\nAfter calling the man and asking for the antidote, the director sighed.\nIf it had been a little later, his life would have been in danger, or he would lose internal energy.\n‘What is he planning?’\nIt was concerning how Chun Yeowun decided to let him take the antidote without any negotiations.\nChun Yeowun must want something.\nOtherwise, this sly man wouldn’t let them off the hook so easily.\n‘I’d give anything away.’\nLooking at him, he asked.\n“... I’m grateful that you let me have the antidote. Senior. If there is anything you wan...”\nIt was then,\nShh!\nSomething was sucked into Chun Yeowun’s hand.\nThat was when something happened.\nPuck!\n“Ack!”\nChun Yeowun injected something into his neck.\n‘!!!’\nSeeing that, Yun Mun-pyeong’s eyes widened.\nThe blue liquid had nano bombs inside it.\nKuak!\n“AH! NOOOO!!”\nDespite the scream, the liquid entered his body.\nThis was a more desperate time than when the One Time’s poison was in his body.\nChun Yeowun smiled.\n“Thank you. From now on, you are mine.”\n‘This... this... this color is...’\nHe couldn’t speak.\nHe saw the terminal controlling the bomb in Chun Yeowun’s hand.\nSmiling, Chun Yeowun reached out into the case.\nShhh!\nThe remaining syringe was sucked into his right hand.\nChun Yeowun looked at the ceiling and asked.\n“The one above you is up there?”\n⁽¹⁾Signal meaning data/information that gets printed after it’s sent.",

      "content": "The 40th floor of Six Road Toys building.\nThe top floor was where the president of the office was located, his own dedicated space.\nSomeone was answering the call at the desk of the president’s office which boasts a luxurious interior exceeding the 36th floor.\nA dark-skinned bald man in his early fifties, the president of Six Road Toys. Yeom Ki-seop.\nLike Yun Mun-peyong, he was dispatched to this place and a person who reached Superior Master level.\nJudging by the thickness of the upper body and the arms, he looked exceptionally bulked, he looked like he trained physically too.\n“What? We got an emergency order from the head office?”\n-... I think you should come down and see.\n“I get it.”\n-See you at my office.\nClick!\nWith those words, Yun Mun-peyong hung up the call.\nAs a result, the expression of Yeom Ki-seop was distorted.\nHe was annoyed with the attitude of the director, who had hung up the call on the president.\nBang!\nHe slammed his fist on the desk and muttered.\n“Damn it! He seems to have forgotten who the boss is. I don’t understand the intention of the head office to put the safe installed in Director Yun’s office and not mine!”\nThe safe was usually placed in the head’s office.\nHowever, some of the affiliates made it installed in the director or other executive’s office.\nThis action made him feel less like the boss.\n“... look at his words. I won’t believe it unless it is from the direct line of the head office.”\nPresident shook his head.\nOriginally, he was the president of Essex Toys, a small business other than Blade Six.\nIn old Murim, it would be something like Fist of Sea King.\nThe reason he was the president of Six Road Toys, an affiliate of Blade Six, is that his company had merged with the company which is the largest conglomerate in Murim.\n“In the end, this is the boss of public opinion.”\nBlade Six is a popular pro-social enterprise.\nAs such, it takes a lot of performance measures to keep themselves in the same position.\nIn the end, that was the reason why Ki-seop was appointed as the president of the merged company and the president of the current affiliate too.\n“Haa.”\nHe had no choice but to follow the head office’s decisions.\nWhen he was transferred to here, he had a small glimmer of hope that the safe would be in the president’s office.\nClick!\nHe opened the door of his office and came out.\nWhen the president appeared, all the secretaries stood up.\n“No need. Sit.”\n“If you are moving, we will accompany you sir.”\nIt was natural for the assistants to move around along with the president.\nHowever, Yeom Ki-seop waved his hand and said,\n“Director Yun has an urgent report, so I am heading down.”\n“Ahh...”\nThe secretaries nodded in agreement.\nThey roughly know how the company worked.\nThere were rumors circulating that the real power was in the hands of the director.\n‘These people!’\nThe president was even more annoyed with their attitude.\nThese people hurt his pride more than the words of the director, so he just decided to move alone, but from a certain moment, the secretaires too knew that the president had no power in his hand.\nThu!\nHe went out and pressed the elevator button.\nSoon, the elevator from the 36th floor arrived on the 40th floor.\nThis too makes a lot of sense, this elevator too was supposed to be used by only the president, but now he was sharing this with the director too.\n‘Dog shit bastard. Let me catch you.’\nHe hoped that the director would make one big mistake at least once.\nSo that he could use it as a way to sabotage the director.\nThe president had the confidence to apply pressure on the matter if he could find the mistake as he was superior in every level.\nDing-dong!\nWhile he mumbled, he arrived on the 36th floor.\nAfter passing through the usual hallway and arriving at the front of the secretary’s office, he saw two familiar faces.\n“Ah! President!”\nA man wearing a coat took his sunglasses off and said hello.\nAnd a young man with shaggy pants and a spot on his face bowed.\n‘He called them too?’\nThe president was displeased.\nHe knew them.\nNot the man in his early thirties, but the ugly one with the sunglasses.\nA hidden team which carried out secret missions by the directive of the headquarters.\n‘I told them to refrain from entering and leaving the office because of the eyes which see them, but they ignore my words.’\nThese people weren’t the employees of the company.\nIt was risky to call these two into the company.\n“It has been a while, team leader Ho.”\nKi-seop smiled.\nBut actually sent a message.\n[I told you to refrain from coming and leaving the company in broad daylight, didn’t the director tell you?]\nAt that, Ho Jeong sent another message.\n[No. I did hear. But this time I had no choice but to come.]\nHo Jeong showed the case bag.\nPresident Ki-seop frowned.\nHe couldn’t have not known that.\n‘Antidote!’\nDirector Yun had a dirty way of doing things.\nWhich was why the performance of people he brought was higher than others.\n‘Right, weren’t we getting a new member to the team today? It must have been difficult to use the One Time’s since the team member number 3.’\nThese teams, the people in them had higher skills than normal Murim warriors.\nMost of the people with clean records were brought in and then selected, and there were many who had extremely high self-esteem.\nEven those people turned obedient to director Yun.\nStarting with One Time’s, the nano bombs planted in their bodies made it impossible for them to not give in.\n[That, president. The director said it was urgent, can we enter first?]\nThey were about to enter the office.\nAt those words, the president nodded and said.\n“I too have something to say with Director Yun, so let’s go together.”\n“Yes, sir.”\nIt didn’t matter since the president knew what was happening.\nWhen he entered the secretary’s office, the female employees stood and greeted them.\nEven if he didn’t have power, he still had the title.\n“President, why are yo...”\n“Director Yun called me. didn’t he tell you?”\n“Uh? No. we didn’t hear anything. He is in an interview right now.”\nAt those words, the president clicked his tongue.\nHe called and didn’t even bother informing the secretary.\nYeom Ki-seop didn’t know who the boss was.\n“It seems like director Yun had forgotten. This happens a lot, right?”\nIn his words, the secretaries were at a loss of what to do.\nOf course, if the president went in, the director would be angry.\n“I will inform the director right now that you are here. Just a seco...”\n“No. he called me for the interview so I will head in. Kuam!”\n“Ah...”\nWith that, the president began to walk.\nRealising how he must be feeling, the secretaries stayed silent not saying anything, and decided to call the director and inform him.\nClick!\nThe president opened the door and entered the office.\nAfter that, Ho Jeong and Geum Jong-so.\nGeum Jong-si, the last one, closed the door.\n‘Since the antidote isn’t given, the injection wasn’t given right>’\nHis only purpose here was to know the password of the safe.\nHe saw the director unlock the secret door when he was given the injection.\nDirector Yun’s office was quite large, so they would have to walk through a small hallway.\n‘Hmm.’\nThere was a presence of three people inside.\nThe president, Yeom Ki-seop clicked his tongue.\nStarting from the breath of one person, the unstable energy of one.\n‘No matter how much I say, he ends up using it too much.’\nThe smell of blood was clear.\nAs soon as he passed the hallway, his footsteps stopped.\n“Wh-what the hell is this?”\nHe couldn’t hide his dismay.\nAs he entered the corner and turned left, he saw a severed arm lying on the floor next to Yun Mun-pyeong.\n‘Did he cut off an arm? Is the director out of his bloody mind...?’\nThe face of the president hardened as he turned his head and looked at the sofa.\nHe doubted his own eyes.\nIt was the same for those behind him.\n“Di-Director!”\nShockingly, the arm of the director was cut off.\nIt was hard to guess what happened.\nAt that moment, the director shouted.\n“Ho Jeong! The-the antidote!”\nHis usual arrogant and confident appearance erased all their doubts.\nHowever, the cold sweat and bloodshot eyes didn’t seem good.\n‘What? Did he...’\nGeum Jong-so’s eyes widened.\nHe saw a young man with long hair and historical clothes seated on the sofa.\nIt was Chun Yeowun.\n‘It is him!’\nThe one he was supposed to investigate.\nEven if he didn’t remember the face, the clothes were all he needed to identify him.\n‘The person I had to investigate the new recruit?’\nBut the situation was weird.\nIt was completely opposite of what anyone would think.\nDirector Yun Mun-pyeong shouted to them, who were all dumbfounded with the situation they were witnessing.\n“What the fuck are you doing! Give me the damn antidote!”\n“Y-yes sir!”\nTeam leader Ho Jeong was at a loss of words.\nHe knelt next to the sofa where the arm was cut off.\n‘Damn it!’\nClick!\nI hesitated for a moment, but he had the antidote so he tried to open the case, but president Yeom Ki-seop stopped him.\n‘Why?’\nTo the puzzled him, the president shook his head and asked.\n“What happened, Director Yun?”\nThe others couldn’t see, but his lips had a subtle smile.\nHe was happy that the director was suffering!\n‘He always behaved so arrogantly!’\nHe desperately wanted the director to make a mistake, and now his wish was granted.\nIt was fun until he looked at Chun Yeowun.\n‘Hm, the energy...’\nIt was just Super Master level.\nHowever, the fact that Yun Mun-pyeong, a Superior Master was like this, meant that the energy was concealed.\n‘Probably the same level or higher.’\nHe couldn’t think that a person who looked to be in early twenties was beyond that.\nAnd thought that if two people could work together, this young one could be suppressed.\n‘Well, I don’t think that is necessary. If he had taken the One Time’s.’\nAt that when Yun Mun-pyeong yelled.\n“What are you doing? Ho Jeon! Give me the bloody antidote!”\nIf he looked at it, surely the director was his supervisor and the antidote had to be given, but it seemed dangerous to give it without knowing what happened.\nThat was when President Yeom Ki-seop said.\n“Stop it. Director Yun. I know you are troubled. Trying to use the antidote on you because you just got caught by him, your judgement must be seriously messed up.”\n“Wh-what are you even saying?”\n“Stay still. You are making a fuss over things which will resolve naturally over time.”\nAt those words, the director frowned.\n‘This... this bastard...’\nApparently, the president misunderstood the situation.\nHe is thinking that Chun Yeowun is poisoned.\nAlthough his pride hurt, he was running out of time, with full strength Yun Mun-pyeong said.\nWhoo!\n“It isn’t him!”\n“Isn’t him! Your arm is cut off and now you suddenly act like...”\n“I have taken the poison!”\n“What?”\nThe president who was smiling, when stiff.\nHe thought that Chun Yeowun was poisoned, but this was absurd.\n“What nonsense...”\nIt was then.\nShhh!\n“Ack!”\nThe case Ho Jeong was holding fell out.\nAnd then it moved and fell in front of director Yun.\nTuk!\n“Ho-how?”\nHo Jeong was shocked as he looked at Chun Yeowun.\nHe was the only one who must have done it.\n“T-thank you! Senior!”\nClick!\nThanking Chun Yeowun, director Yun opened the case and took out the brown syringe and pushed it into his thigh.\n“Haa...”\nHis anxious face resolved with that.\nIt was a situation where if he was one minute late, the poison would have started to spread through his body.\n‘Damn it!’\nThe eyes of the president who recognized the danger, turned bitter.\nThis man had to be subdued.\nKi-seop shouted.\n“I move ahead, so you support me!”\nPhat!\nAs soon as he said that, he approached Chun Yeowun who was sitting on the sofa.\nJjkk!\nAs soon as he raised his arm, the jack swelled up revealing his strong muscles.\n‘Suppression at once.’\nKnowing that the opponent is of the same level, he had to move fast and one step ahead.\nA blue light shone from Yeom Ji-seop’s fist.\nFist Ki.\n‘The 7th technique of Fist of Sea King’s!’\nHis hand went for Chun Yeowun aiming to kill him.\nSince he was doing the first attack, he thought that the opponent would do something.\nBut it was strange.\n‘Why is he still...’\nIt was then.\nChun Yeowun sat and only raised his palm and lowered.\nKwang!\n“Ack!”\nAn unimaginable energy pressed down his body.\n‘Wh-what energy!’\nThis wasn’t something that he could endure.\nBoth the knees of the president dug into the office marble floor.\n“Kuak!”\nTrmble!\nIt was no use trying to stand up.\nIt was then he knew.\n‘He isn’t of Superior Master level.’\nWhat kind of a Superior Master could do this to a person of the same level with a single gesture?\nThis is only possible with overwhelming capabilities.\n“Wh-who are you?”\nAt that question, Chun Yeowun said something else.\n“Thank you for coming this close to me.”\n“What?”\nPuck!\n“Ack!”\nSomething touched his neck.\nLike something was being injected into his body.\n“Wh-what are you doing!”\nFlustered, Yeon Ki-seop wanted to shake it off, but he couldn’t.\nAnd then, it fell.\n‘!!!’\nSeeing what fell, the president went stiff and scared.\n‘This...’\nThe nano bomb syringe.\nThe blue liquid in the syringe was empty.\n‘Uh, how... the injection?’\nIt is supposed to be in the safe.\nHe was too flustered to even say anything, but then he heard someone laugh.\n‘...?’\nThat person was Yun Mun-pyeong, the director, who was kneeling near the sofa.",

      "content": "Yeon Company which was located in the eastern part of Shenyang city.\nIn the executive director’s office on the 42nd floor of the office building, a man in his late thirties in a navy blue suit was working at his desk, concentrating on something.\nThe man was Moyong Yi-sun, the successor and executive director of the company.\nShhh!\nAs he flipped through the touchscreen on the desk, he saw portraits.\nThe pictures files on the screen had two things in common.\nThe first thing they had in common was the distance from which the photos were taken.\nAnd the second was Jo Yu-seong.\nMost of the photos had Jo Yu-seong, the general manager and head of the Human Resources department at Six Road Toys, in them.\nOf course, besides Jo Yu-seong, there was also a man in a jacket and sunglasses, but it was difficult to find that person’s identity.\nBasic information was obtained, but they couldn’t find another connection with the one called Ho Jeong.\nHe must be someone related to Murim, but he didn’t seem to be registered as a Murim warrior in the State Council.\n‘Eight people like this.’\nA total of eight people.\nThose who Jo Yu-seong came in contact with recently, 8 unregistered Murim warriors.\nFor three months, Jo Yu-seong had been gathering that kind of person.\n‘It would be nice if we could plant someone from our side in them.’\nMoyong Yi-sun made contact with those who manipulated their identities.\nBut all attempted contacts failed.\nOne wasn’t skilled enough, and the other committed suicide in danger of being found out as a spy.\nShh!\nAs he flipped through the pictures, the last picture had come up.\nA black sedan, exiting the Public Security, the vehicle of Jo Yu-seong.\nAnd the photo was snapped in the morning.\nTak!\nMoyong Yi-sun tapped the photo with his finger.\n‘The missing 9th guy.’\nThey hadn’t missed a single one.\nThe reason was that he had been monitoring the actions of Jo Yu-seong for 4 months.\nExcept when entering the company’s building or his home, every other place has been marked.\n‘At that time, public security was involved. Sigh...’\nThe reason the last one was missed was because of the public security’s jamming system.\nThanks to the waves that format the files on recording devices, all the photos of the 9th man taken by his men were deleted.\nThere was only one piece of information.\n‘Long hair and clothes seen in historical dramas...’\nThat wasn’t enough information.\nThey at least had to have a description of the face.\nThe matter was becoming complicated.\nBeep!\nA female secretary’s voice came from the phone.\n-Director. You have a guest.\n“Guest?”\nAlthough his schedule was empty until the late afternoon, this should be his only free time.\nHe was puzzled when he heard,\n-That... ah! Wait... if you go...\nClick!\nThen someone opened the door and entered his office.\n“... Lee Myeong?”\nHe was the 3rd team leader of the Public Security’s violent crimes squad, Lee Myeong.\nAt the unexpected appearance of the person, Moyong Yi-sun abruptly closed the screen and got up.\n“Why are you here? Shouldn’t you be in the hospital?”\nLee Myeong frowned at Yi-sun’s words.\nHe hadn’t even informed his own mother that he was hurt, but this man seemed to know that he was hospitalized.\nIn a displeased voice, he said,\n“Are you keeping an eye on me?”\n“Ha! Is this how you talk to your older brother? Do you think I go and dig up information on you in my spare time?”\nHe just found out by chance.\nMoyong Yi-sun had been informed that Lee Myeong was shot while his men took pictures of the 9th man.\n“Don’t speak rubbish. Since when were you my older brother? If you thought of us as brothers, you wouldn’t have left me.”\nClench!\nHe was about to reach out to Lee Myeong in anger, but then at the words he heard, Yi-sung lowered his hand.\nWith a cold face, which regained his reasoning, he said,\n“It’s a waste to use my hand against trash that can’t even perform martial arts.”\nThis time, Lee Myeong’s eyes were cold.\nTo say that he can’t perform martial arts when it’s a trauma for him.\nSarcastically, Moyong Yi-sun asked.\n“Fine. What is the leader of the Public Security Bureau doing here?”\n“Jo Yu-seong. Yun Mun-pyeong.”\nMoyong Yi-sun frowned at those names.\nThese names weren’t something that a violent crimes detective should mention.\nThis wasn’t a special unit.\n“This morning, Jo Yu-seong borrowed power from director Yun Mun-pyeong of the Six Road Toys and took a suspect who was under investigation.”\n“... and what?”\n“Don’t act cheeky. I saw you at University hospital, where the man stopped. What the hell were you up to?”\n“What?”\nAt Lee Myeong’s words, Moyong Yi-sun was flustered.\nIt seemed like Lee Myeong thought Moyong Yi-sun was related to them.\nRather, it seemed like he wanted Moyong Yi-sun to be involved with them.\n‘The RV that was in that accident belonged to the Public Security. They too seem to be tracking Jo Yu-seong.’\nBut thanks to this, he learned something he didn’t know.\nAnd Lee Myeong continued to talk.\n“The recent business partnership between the Yeon Company and the Six Road Toys has been in the news for quite a long time. If there is something you are hiding, reveal it now.”\nWith a look of displeasure, Moyong Yi-sun opened his mouth and spoke to Lee Myeong, who was acting like he was conducting an interrogation.\n“Don’t cross the line. Trust the information, but don’t overdo it.”\n“Are you threatening me?”\n“What good will a businessman like me get from threatening a government official? Huh. If you want to know stuff, get a warrant first.”\nLee Myeong frowned at the word warrant.\nAs he was suspended, he wasn’t even a detective right now.\nAnd if he acted out right now, things would become messy for him.\n“Hmph!”\nIn the end, he was at a disadvantage.\nThis guy right in front of him is anxious, and he won’t stand back from biting Lee Myeong if he has the chance because of the competition of successors. After all, they share the same bloodline.\nGiving up, Lee Myeong turned around.\nThat was when Moyong Yi-sun said.\n“Seeing that you don’t have a warrant, it seems like you are doing things your own way, but I’m warning you.”\n“What?”\nMoyong Yi-sun warned Lee Myeong, who turned back.\n“Jo Yu-seong, no, the director, Yun Mun-pyeong, is a very dangerous man. If you don’t want to lose your life, stop digging for information and get away from this investigation.”\nAt the same time.\nThe room on the 36th floor of the Six Road Toys’ building.\nSomeone politely handed Chun Yeowun, who was on the sofa, something.\nThe dangerous man, Yun Mun-pyeong.\n“You aren’t fooling around, right?”\n“No, never, senior!”\nWith only his left arm, he handed over a few sheets of warm A4 papers that had just been printed. They were from the Blade Six.\n‘Damn it.’\nEven though he wasn’t saying it out loud, Yun Mun-pyeong was miserable inside.\nThe situation was reversed.\nThese were the people who tried to use Chun Yeowun as a consumable. They ended up being in a situation where they knelt and bowed to him.\n‘Shit!’\nYun Mun-pyeong turned his gaze to the right armrest of the sofa, which Chun Yeowun was sitting on.\nOn it was the control terminal of the nano bombs.\nIf Chun Yeowun pressed the button, he and the people inside the room would die as he would explode.\nIt was then, someone kneeling on the side of the sofa carefully opened his mouth.\n“I don’t know if you saw any material you like. There are also quite a lot of things on my personal PC in my office...”\n“Be quiet.”\n“... yes.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s sharp words, the president of the Six Road Toys went silent right away.\nHe, who tried to act out at the beginning of the situation, began to try and please Chun Yeowun.\nHowever, it wasn’t an easy task for him, who always stood at the top, to act this way.\nLooking at that, director Yun Mun-pyeong shook his head.\n‘This... this... sly bastard!’\nYeom Ki-seop was so annoyed that the veins on his forehead bulged.\n‘Who caused all of this!’\nIf such a thing were happening, any man with common sense would try to relay that a problem had arisen, even if it meant losing his life.\nHowever, as if what happened to him wasn’t enough, he dragged the president into the same situation.\nMaybe, the director felt the anger of the president. He turned his head away and coughed.\n‘Hmm.’\nWhether he saw it or not, Chun Yeowun was looking through the material.\nThe materials handed to him by Yun Mun-pyeong were related to the Blade Six’s Murim clan.\nThe Blade Six managed the clan by dividing it into direct and merged groups.\n‘Of the 87 affiliates, 13 of them are merged. And there are 74 recognized executives in the Blade Six?’\nOn the back of the documents were the names of the affiliates and the presidents.\nYun Mun-pyeong, a man who desired to reach the top, had a close relationship with them.\nHis purpose was to become the 75th executive.\nIf it wasn’t for this accident, he might have become the youngest executive in the Blade Six.\n“Do you have any information about the head office?”\nAccording to the document, six main executives were leading the head office, and the Chairman was the center of the Blade Six.\nHowever, the information about anything except the affiliates was missing.\nThere was a picture of the Chairman’s face attached to the very back of the document, but that was something Chun Yeowun already knew.\n‘He isn’t the Blade God.’\nIt was a different face.\nEven in his era, the Blade God had once made a person named the Blade Lord the head of the Blade God Six Martial Clan and pulled the strings from behind, which meant that the data now couldn’t be trusted.\n“What about those executives?”\n“T-Those six executives at the head office are among the other executives. Only the 7 presidents who belong to the major business divisions can be seen at the shareholders’ meetings.”\nAt Yun Mun-pyeong’s words, Chun Yeowun looked at Yeom Ki-seop.\n“It has been only a few months since we merged. Ours is a new affiliate.”\nAt the word merged, he lowered his head with a bitter expression.\nIn reality, other than what Yun Mun-pyeong could give, there was nothing that the president could offer.\n‘The information about the clan is different.’\nStill, it was better than not knowing anything.\nAnd now was the time to ask real questions.\nIf these were the Blade God Six Martial Clan’s descendants, they would have fought with the Sky Demon Order.\nThe more enemies the Blade Six had, the more information their enemies would have on them.\n“Do you know about the Sky Demon Order?”\n“Sorry?”\nYun Mun-pyeong seemed confused and puzzled by that question.\nIt was as if he was listening to that name for the first time.\n“You aren’t pretending to not know?”\nAt the irritated voice, Yun Mun-pyeong waved his hands and denied it.\n“No, why would I? This is my first time hearing it.”\n“First time hearing it?”\nChun Yeowun’s face darkened.\nHe was concerned that the Sky Demon Order didn’t exist in this time axis.\nAt that time, Yun Mun-pyeong, who was constantly mumbling Sky Demon Order, seemed to remember something and asked.\n“... ah senior. By any chance, are you talking about the Black Sky Company, which was dissolved 26 years ago, the organization which was once called the Demonic cult?”\n“What?”\nChun Yeowun jumped at those words.\nIf the word dissolve wasn’t much different from what he understood, it meant that the Sky Demon Order was disbanded.\nChun Yeowun looked at Yun Mun-pyeong and said,\n“Say that once again, clearly...”\nIt was then.\nA small vibration.\nWheik!\nThe terminal, which was on the armrest, fell into someone’s hand.\nThe man in a jacket, Ho Jeong.\n“Hahahaha!”\nHe couldn’t hide his joy as he recaptured the terminal capable of detonating the nano bombs.\nHe was waiting for the moment when Chun Yeowun would divert his attention.\nReaching the Super Master Level, he wasn’t as good as the two Superior Masters, but he could still control objects in the air.\n‘Ah!’\nBoth the director and the president couldn’t hide their surprise.\nThey didn’t know that he could do such things.\n‘This is great!’\nIf the terminal was in their hands, they could just run away.\nThe president shouted.\n“You did well. Ho Jeong! Quickly...”\nCrack!\nAt that moment, an unexpected thing happened.\nThe terminal, which was in Ho Jeong’s hands, shattered into pieces.\nThe president couldn’t hide his shock.\n“You... what the hell did you do?”\nWithout that, it would be impossible to detonate or even disarm the nano bombs.\nBut now, it was broken.\nHo Jeong smiled at them.\n“Hahaha, how long did you think that I would obey your orders because of the nano bombs inside my body?”\n“What?”\n“In the end, there’s nothing that a guy like me can do against people like you. When else would such a great opportunity arise for me? Now both of you will be aware of the pain of carrying nano bombs inside of your body. Hahaha.”\nEveryone was shocked at those words.\nThey thought that he was the most loyal person, that was why he was given the title of team leader, but now, they saw a side of him that they didn’t even know existed.\nEven Geum Jong-so was the same.\n‘Th-This crazy bastard!’\nIt was something he heard about before being injected with a nano bomb.\nThe only device which could control the signal code of the detonators in their bodies was the terminal.\nAnd now, the terminal was shattered.\n‘Without that, the nano bombs in the body can’t be disarmed!’\nEven if there was no way the bombs would explode, the risk of carrying bombs inside their bodies was still present.\nHowever, Ho Jeong was satisfied as he shouted.\n“Heh heh, if even one person wants to survive in the hands of that monster, then I suggest you all run away! Spread out!”\nPhat!\nWith those words, he tried to run towards the window.\nEven if it was dangerous, he decided to break the window and jump.\nRunning out of the office would get him caught by the monster once again.\nIt was then.\nSnap!\nThe sound of a snap echoed through the office.\nAnd then,\nPapapang!\nA red light rose from Ho Jeong’s body as if he was burning up, along with the sound of an explosion.\n“This, how can this...”\nShhhh!\nWhen Geum Jong-so opened his mouth in shock, Ho Jeong’s charred body turned to ashes and collapsed.\n‘Th-The nano bombs exploded!’\nYun Mun-pyeong had seen it in the demonstration video before receiving the nano bombs.\nThe best thing about the nano bombs was that the explosion didn’t cause damage to the surroundings and killed the host from the inside.\n‘He doesn’t have the detonator, so how?’\nEveryone looked at Chun Yeowun, who snapped his fingers.\nNano’s voice echoed in his head.\n[Transmission of the copied detonator’s black code has been completed.]\nNano had copied the ten detonation codes.\nThere was no need for a terminal anymore.\nChun Yeowun turned his head to Yeom Ki-seop, who halfway stood up to run.\n‘Shit!’\nDirector Yun Mun-pyeong, who was next to him, shouted.\n“I-I didn’t even move, senior!”",

      "content": "Chun Yeowun seemed pissed.\nAs a result, everyone in the office was extremely attentive.\nThe president was restless.\nWhen Ho Jeong stole the terminal, which could detonate the nano bombs, he, too, wanted to run away.\n‘Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it....’\nBut Ho Jeong was killed.\nAs a result, there was nothing but the fear of death running through his mind.\nIt was a pity to see his sweaty face.\n‘He must be really scared.’\nGeum Jong-so bit his tongue as if he was the president.\nThey were completely broken.\nIt was the same with Jo Yu-seong, who was kneeling in the corner with a pale face.\n‘He, he... showed it to us on purpose.’\nGeum Jong-so was sure.\nFrom the beginning, he was puzzled by the fact that no matter how strong the man was, he wasn’t blocking their blood points.\nEven if the nano bombs were there, there were chances to run.\nBecause variables can occur.\n‘It wasn’t that Ho Jeong got the detonator, nor did he seize the opportunity. The man just gave it to him.’\nThe device couldn’t be just taken away from such a monster.\nIf one thought about it, it was strange to leave such an important object on the sofa’s armrest.\nAnd with that, everyone found out.\nThe fact that the nano bombs could be detonated without the terminal.\n‘What the hell?’\nIt wasn’t sure what he did, but now this monster could detonate the nano bombs without the terminal.\nAnd with that, their reality looked even worse.\nStarting with the company’s CCTV, the security guards, the director who is a Superior Master, and the hidden safe with three levels of security, that terminal couldn’t be stolen no matter how many times Geum Jong-so thought.\n‘A monster that crushes everything with overwhelming force.’\nThat monster had control of the nano bombs.\nThe Public Security Bureau ended up putting his life in the hands of an unknown person.\nGeum Jong-so’s mind was messed up.\n‘Now, there are two ways.’\nThe Public Security technical team finds a way to disarm the bomb.\nOr that monster in front of him disarms it.\nThe former was the safest method, but\n‘Will they really do that?’\nThe Public Security Bureau doesn’t want the public to learn that they’ve planted spies in companies out of fear of garnering a bad reputation.\nThat was the reason why they used him and not some official person of their bureau.\nIt wouldn’t be strange if they abandoned him.\n‘... should I try making a deal with that man even if the risks are high?’\nHe looked at Chun Yeowun, who sat at Yun Mun-pyeong’s desk and stared at the monitor.\nHe was afraid of making a bad impression.\n‘Sigh... he doesn’t have a bad face unlike Ho Jeong, but I’m terrified.’\nWhen he looked at Chun Yeowun, it was like an overwhelming force was being pushed onto him.\nIf he did nothing, his life could be in jeopardy.\n‘Should I give up and trust the Public Security Bureau... no, rather than trusting them, I’ll work something out.’\nGeum Jong-so, who was worried, decided.\nThe situation was a mess.\nIt would be better to bet everything on this.\n‘Looking at his reaction... I might be able to give him information and strike a deal.’\nGeum Jong-so’s eyes shone as they looked at Chun Yeowun.\nOn the other hand, Chun Yeowun was intently looking at the monitor.\nA lot of information was displayed.\n[Simyang Daily, 2043. 07. 14\nBlack Sky Company, one of China’s three largest enterprises, collapses.\nAfter Chairman Chun Hyun-seong was arrested last year, the company’s stock prices plunged to the bottom, and the executives of the Black Sky Company announced the dissolution of the company at noon today, through their shareholders’ meeting.\n63 affiliates are already in the process of dismantling and merging, and the Chinese government expects this situation to cause serious economic turbulence....]\nThis article was from 26 years ago.\nIn addition to that, several articles were reported as hot topics.\nMost of the articles said that the company’s image was damaged, and its stock price plummeted after the chairman’s arrest.\n/strong>\n‘It doesn’t make sense.’\nThe company disbanded after the chairman was sentenced to life in prison.\nIt was too fast.\nChun Yeowun, who simply received the information, didn’t think it made sense.\n‘Something is odd.’\nThe information seemed too fake.\nIt was like something related to Murim had happened.\nA clear example was the next article.\n[2043. 07. 25\nFounding of the State Council’s Murim Department.\nPrime Minister Dang Ji-san, who announced the establishment of the new Murim...\n... the first year’s goal is to have more than 60% of Murim people register with the department.]\nAbout ten days after the Black Sky Company was disbanded, the registration of Murim started.\nThis was the point where the line between the government and Murim was erased.\nChun Yeowun thought that it wasn’t a mere coincidence.\n‘This is enough.’\nHe needed more information, but it was 26 years ago, and many things were missing.\nAccording to Nano, a lot of important data was deleted.\n“Sigh.”\nA sigh.\nYun Mun-pyeong wanted to know what was happening, but he couldn’t ask.\nHe only knew about the current rival groups of the Blade Six.\nThere was a limit to how much information he could get from his position.\n‘Useless bastard.’\nChun Yeowun looked at him.\nMaybe he felt the eyes on him, Yun Mun-pyeong trembled.\nChun Yeowun rested his chin on his hand as he thought.\n‘Even if it’s a different time axis, the cult collapsed too easily. I just can’t understand.’\nAs the 2nd Chun Ma and the Lord, he couldn’t admit it.\nIf it was the Sky Demon Order he knew, it couldn’t fall to threats and crises.\nHe never imagined how easy it would be for it to break up.\n‘... there is only one answer.’\nIf the Sky Demon Order was in danger and disappeared, there was one thing he had to do.\n‘Find them!’\nAfter reading the data for nearly two hours, Chun Yeowun grasped the situation and got up as he organized his thoughts.\nEveryone in the office stared at him.\nThat was when he called.\n“Yun Mun-pyeong.”\n“Y-Yes! Senior!”\nHe answered right away.\nFor two hours, he was worried about what would happen to him.\nBut now, Chun Yeowun said something unexpected.\n“Didn’t you say that you have a position where you can talk with your superiors?”\n“Y-Yes.”\n“Great. Then let the head office know that you hired the new one without any problems.”\n“Sorry?”\n“Did you not understand what I said?”\nAs Chun Yeowun asked with his eyebrows raised, Yun Mun-pyeong shook his head.\n“Ah-no! I will bury what happened here and make sure that it doesn’t leak out!”\nChun Yeowun nodded at that answer.\nChun Yeowun was going to cover this situation up so that the Blade Six wouldn’t notice it.\n“You understand too?”\n“Yes!”\nEven the president answered in the same way.\nHe answered, but he couldn’t erase his displeasure.\n‘... I’m the president, so why is he acting like my superior?’\nHe was still annoyed with Yun Mun-pyeong.\nNo matter what he felt, Chun Yeowun would go ahead with his plan.\nAnd now, Chun Yeowun intends to use the Blade Six and find traces of the Sky Demon Order.\n‘They don’t know of my existence. If they do, I will completely destroy them this time.’\nEverything is still unclear for now.\nHowever, the disappearance of his cult was certainly not a natural occurrence.\nHe wasn’t heartbroken, just determined.\n‘If I use this one properly, it will be worthwhile.’\nChun Yeowun thought that as he looked at Yun Mun-pyeong.\nThe position he held could be used in many ways.\nChun Yeowun planned on using him till the end.\nAs if he instinctively read something in Chun Yeowun’s eyes, Yun Mun-pyeong couldn’t hide his anxiety.\nCrackle!\nChun Yeowun pulled something out of his sleeve.\nA paper from the Blade Six.\nAs a result of the requested investigation, the probability of a spy is 80%. Team 7 should be removed.\nSecure the 3rd team leader of the violent crimes squad, Moyong Lee Myeong.\nFrom February 23rd to 24th, Gate 26 warning is scheduled. Be sure to destroy the confidential internal data.\nReviewing the report on the operation to assassinate the executive director of the Yeon Company, which was taken to the upper level. Payment is due before Gate Warning 26.\nThe directive to be followed.\nChun Yeowun noticed two things.\nHe didn’t pay attention to it before, but it seemed like the Moyong family was involved.\n‘Good.’\nIf not, he would have had to search other places for information.\nIf the descendants of the Moyong clan were there, then they might have different information.\nIt was written to secure someone of the Moyong clan.\n‘Violent crimes, huh.’\nChun Yeowun called the name of the man who was obedient to him.\n“Yun Mun-pyeong.”\n“Yes! Senior.”\n“I need the best attire and Human Skin Mask of this era.”\n“Yes?”\nThe director frowned.\nIt was strange to call it this era.\nBut he couldn’t understand what a skin mask was.\n“I... what is a skin mask, senior?”\nHuman Skin Mask.\nIt refers to a face mask made from human skin or a specific animal to disguise someone as another person.\nWhen he was in Murim, it was beneficial to Chun Yeowun.\nChun Yeowun decided that he would need it to change his appearance because of the Public Security Bureau.\n“You don’t know what a Human Skin Mask is?”\nThat was when someone intervened.\n“Are you talking about something like cotton wool that you can put on your face?”\nIt was Geum Jong-so.\nYun Mun-pyeong nodded his head at those words.\nChun Yeowun roughly understood it.\n“I want one...”\n“That! Director. There’s an expert that I know. Can I guide you?”\nGeum Jong-so intervened.\nThis was a good opportunity for him.\n‘This is great. I was trying to create an opportunity.’\nThe director looked at Geum Jong-so with narrowed eyes.\nHe knew that this kid was a spy of the Public Security Bureau as it was in the orders and information given on the paper in the safe.\nHe tried to warn him.\n[That, senior. That one is...]\n[I know.]\n[Ah...]\nOf course, Chun Yeowun had looked at the paper too; there was no way he wouldn’t know.\nBut Chun Yeowun didn’t care.\nHe was planning on using Public Security to some extent too.\n[It doesn’t matter. I can take care of it myself. Don’t worry about it.]\n[I-I understand.]\nYun Mun-pyeong nodded his head and backed off.\nAnd Chun Yeowun said to the young one.\n“Guide me.”\n“Yes! I will guide you right away!”\nExcited, Geum Jong-so tried to guide him outside.\nHe was already under suspicion, so he had to rush out.\nIt was then.\n“Wait!”\nYun Mun-pyeong stopped him.\n‘Damn it!’\nGeum Jong-so stopped with a frown.\nIt seemed like this wasn’t going to be easy.\nHis heart was pounding.\n“What?”\nChun Yeowun, who was following Geum Jong-so, asked when Yun Mun-pyeong pulled out a business card and said.\n“Please accept this.”\n“Huh?”\n“This is the corporate card. If you get tailored clothes and cut your hair, you might need this. You can use it as much as you want.”\nYun Mun-pyeong was trying to please Chun Yeowun.\n‘Sigh...’\nGeum Jong-so, who was nervous, sighed.\nHe was glad.\nHe was worried that someone else would tell Chun Yeowun the truth, so he quickly guided them out of the building as soon as possible.\nOutside, a few blocks away, the RV of the dead Ho Jeong was parked.\n‘I’m good at driving.’\nIf he wasn’t good at driving, he wouldn’t have held the key, then the key would have been destroyed when Ho Jeong burnt.\nLike a secretary, he opened the door for Chun Yeowun and then got into the driver’s seat.\nHe needed to head to a place where he could have a conversation with Chun Yeowun.\nSssh!\nGeum Jong-so moved towards the northern outskirts.\nHe knew a place where neither the bureau nor the company would find him.\nAfter driving for about 30 minutes, Chun Yeowun, who was in the back seat, opened his mouth, seeing that the place had no buildings and very few people.\n“How far are we going to talk?”\n‘!?’\nGeum Jong-so looked at Chun Yeowun through the mirror.\nHe didn’t think that Chun Yeowun would recognize his intentions.\n‘... he is good at catching stuff.’\nHe looked around.\nThe place he was currently at had electric poles and very few people.\n‘This should be enough.’\nKick!\nHe stopped the car on the side of the road.\nGeum Jong-so turned his head, to tell the truth, thinking that Chun Yeowun would let him off.\n“I apologize. I should have told you in advance...”\nIt was then.\nWoong!\n“This!”\nA black RV was seen rushing towards them at great speed through the rear window.\nNo matter who looked at it, it seemed like they intended to hit this car.\nIt was too late to start the car and step on the gas.\nSo Geum Jong-so shouted.\n“Y-You need to get out right no...”\n“Such a hassle.”\nAt that time, Chun Yeowun swung his hand back and pushed something sideways.\nBang! Woong!\nAt that moment, the black RV that was about to hit them turned over and crashed.",

      "content": "There was a black RV and a grey sedan tracking the white RV that Chun Yeowun was in.\nThe people inside the two cars were pros at tracking.\nIt was a good opportunity to seize the person they had been tracking and monitoring for nearly three months.\n“Geum Jong-so and the ninth one are moving.”\nThe vehicle, which normally moved on busy roads, wasn’t easy to track as it calls for a lot of attention, but then this car went to a place with fewer people.\nAnd the place the white RV was heading didn’t have many CCTV cameras.\nKiik!\nIn addition, the vehicle just stopped.\nThe team leader in the grey sedan spoke as he pressed the earphone in his left ear.\n“We have a nice chance. What should we do?”\nAnd a voice answered.\n-Click! Capture and bring them here.\n“Understood.”\nWhen the order fell, the team leader spoke while pressing his earphone again.\n“Hit them.”\n-Roger!\nThe black RV ahead of them accelerated and rushed for the parked white RV as soon as the command was issued.\n“Get ready.”\n“Yes!”\nClick! Click!\nExcept for the driver, four men in the sedan pulled out guns with silencers.\nThey were guns with anesthetic bullets.\n“Shoot as soon as they get out of the car.”\n“Yes!”\nEven if they hit the parked car, since the ones inside were Murim warriors, they knew they could come out without injuries.\nIt was then.\nBang! Woong!\nThe black RV rushing head suddenly flipped over.\nIt happened before they could crash into the white RV.\n“The car flipped!”\n“What the hell?”\nThey weren’t sure what was happening, but their targets had to be brought in.\n“Step on it!”\nThe shocked driver stepped on the gas at the order.\nBrrrrng!\nWhen the speed of the car increased, it was ready to collide with the white RV.\nKiiik!\nThe sedan came to a sudden stop.\nThanks to the sudden stop, the people inside ended up banging into the front seats and the dashboard.\n“Crazy bastard! What the fuck are you doing? Why did you hit the brake!”\nAt the man’s yelling, the driver turned his head in a bewildered expression and said,\n“I-It wasn’t me!”\n“What?”\n“My foot is on the gas!”\n“What?”\nWhoong!\nSmoke was rising from the rear wheels of the vehicle.\nIt was a situation where the rubber tires were burning up as the wheels were rotating, but the vehicle wasn’t moving ahead.\n‘!?’\nEveryone inside was shocked.\nTheir vehicle, which was moving so fast, was stopped by some unknown energy.\n“Damn it!”\nThe leader knew that something strange was happening.\n“Get out of the ca...”\nBefore he could finish speaking, the black seat door of the white RV opened, and someone got out.\nThe dress one would see in historical dramas and long black hair.\nTheir target, Chun Yeowun.\n“The 9th one!”\nChun Yeowun reached out to the sedan they were in.\nThey wondered what was going to happen and tried to get out of the car.\nHowever,\nRumble! Clack!\n“Wh-What is this?”\n“Leader! The door isn’t opening!”\nIt was the same for the leader who was about to open the door.\nHe tried to push the door open, but it didn’t even budge.\nThat was when the leader shouted.\n“Break the bloody windows!”\nIf the doors didn’t open, then they had to get out by breaking the window.\nIt was then.\nChun Yeowun grabbed something.\nAnd,\nKiiick! Wack!\n“Ahh!”\n“T-The car!”\nThe sedan started crushing.\nLike a toy being crushed inside a hand.\nGgrrrr!\nIn an instant, the sedan lost its shape.\nGeum Jong-so, who got out of the driver’s seat, was shocked.\nHe was shocked when the car flipped over, but compressing a car was ridiculous.\n‘No, how!’\nIt was a sight that left him speechless.\nOf course, the car was made of metal, and the inside was well equipped to prevent passenger injuries. Still, it was shocking.\n‘... he isn’t human.’\nHe’s a monster, just like the dead Ho Jeong said.\nHe couldn’t even fathom how profound the man’s energy had to be to do such a thing.\nChun Yeowun heard.\n“Catch them.”\nTwo people managed to escape from the vehicle.\nIt was one of the people sitting in the back seat and the leader.\nThey managed to escape after breaking the windows, but both of their faces were pale.\n‘Is he testing their skills?’\nGeum Jong-so, who guessed Chun Yeowun’s intentions, looked at them.\nOne seemed to be at the Super Master Level, and the other was at the beginning of the Super Master Level.\nIt was a level that wasn’t easy to handle.\n‘Still, it isn’t like he can’t suppress them.’\nHe turned his head and slightly looked at him.\n‘It’s impossible for them to hide their skills from that monster. So attack from the start!’\nPhat!\nGeum Jong-so rushed to them.\nHe moved at an excellent speed, which ended up making him a recruit for the Blade Six company.\n“Damn it!”\nPuck! Puck! Puck!\nThe leader fired his gun, which had a silencer on it.\nHowever, Geum Jong-so, who was paying close attention to the path, avoided them at the speed of lightning.\nTatatak!\nThe martial art of Geum Jong-so was boxing. The man shooting the gun immediately responded.\nPapak!\nLikewise, he too seemed to be a close-combat warrior.\nAnd he seemed to have more experience, as he was able to block Geum Jong-so.\n‘He is pretty good.’\nDespite being an enemy, he possessed commendable skills.\nHowever, because there was a fundamental difference in close-combat martial arts, the longer the battle went on, the more advantageous the attacker would be.\n‘The gap!’\nGeum Jong-so, who noticed the gap in the leader’s defense, tried to hit him.\nIt was then, he felt something sharp pierce him.\n“Huh!”\nGeum Jong-so widened the distance right away.\nOne more of the men, who got out, had hit him.\nIt was a short knife, like a dagger, which could be covered by a hand.\n‘Shit!’\nHe thought that the situation could be handled, but it was becoming more annoying.\nAs Geum Jong-so widened the distance, the two of them took a formation.\nClearly, both of them used the same kind of martial art.\n‘Damn it. Does that mean they want to deal with the weaker one first?’\nThe fact that they weren’t rushing in to attack the stronger one gave Geum Jong-so the answer.\nIt seemed that his plan to suppress the pursuers and impress Chun Yeowun was failing. Geum Jong-so glanced back.\n‘... how!’\nIt was shocking.\nSix men were lying on the ground, around Chun Yeowun.\nIt seemed like the people in the black RV had come out and tried to deal with him.\n‘He’s a real monster!’\nMeeting Chun Yeowun’s level would be hard.\nGeum Jong-so bit his lip.\n‘Sigh... I was told not to use it unless I’m in a crisis.’\nIt seemed like he had to resort to something.\nIn order to quickly subdue the two men who were trying to catch him. Geum Jong-so decided and moved.\nPhat!\nThe leader, who thought that the man could be dealt with if he responded cautiously, moved.\nHowever, Geum Jong-so’s movements, which were close to boxing, changed.\n‘Ha?’\nHe was pretending to use boxing when he kicked.\nSince the man kept switching, the leader tried to block the attacks.\nPapapapak!\n“Kuak!”\nIn an instant, Geum Jong-so kicked the leader’s chest and chin.\nThe other man tried to help his leader, but Geum Jong-so’s movements were faster.\n“How dare you!”\nPak!\n“Kuak!”\nGeum Jeong-so jumped into the air and hit the man’s head with a kick.\nSince it was a kick with the strength of a late Super Master, there was no way he could endure it.\nWith a scream, his neck broke as he collapsed.\n‘Damn it! How did his level change!’\nThe leader, who staggered from internal injuries, stared at Geum Jong-so.\nEven when they collided for the first time, it seemed like his level was the same as Geum Jong-so’s.\nBut from the moment Geum Jong-so changed something about his attack pattern, everything changed.\n“Kuak... you hid... your skills. Sly bastard!”\n-Woah.... Do you get it? ⁽¹⁾\nA voice came from the earphone.\nHe could tell what the message meant just by listening to the sighing voice on the other side.\nSince the pursuit failed, there was only one thing they could do.\nClench!\nGeum Jong-so grabbed the collar of the collapsed man with his left hand and tried to lift him up.\nAnd the leader bit his molars.\nCrack!\n“This jerk!”\nWhen he heard the sound of something cracking inside the mouth, Geum Jong-so was shocked and tried to seal the blood points.\nTatatak!\nHowever, it was too late.\nThe leader looked at him with bloodshot eyes.\n‘I-It is too late. You won’t be able to figure anything out.’\nIf the liquid inside the capsule stuck on the molars is swallowed, the man would lose his life in 10 seconds.\nEven the earphone connected to the ear was designed to automatically format its frequency if the body’s energy disappears or if the earphone is taken out.\nDrip!\nIt was only three to four seconds before the strong poison began to work as blood came out of his mouth.\nGeum Jong-so frowned at the body’s convulsions.\n“Damn it!”\nIf his blood points were sealed even a second earlier, he could have questioned him.\nIt was then.\n“Hold him.”\n“Huh?”\nTak!\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun approached and placed his hand near the dying leader’s dantian.\nA tremendous amount of internal energy rushed into his dantian.\n“Kuak! Kuak!”\nThe eyes of the leader, who was distracted by the pure energy, opened wide as the poison was temporarily suppressed.\nThree more seconds and he would have seen the underworld.\nChun Yeowun’s other hand went to the earphone in the left ear.\nThe leader laughed.\n‘S... stupid... man... if... you take it... out my ear....’\nNo use.\nThere was no way the original source could be tracked. What could these two people do?\nBesides, everything would be formatted if the device was removed from the ear.\n-Jjjkkk!\n“Kuak!”\nSuddenly, the earphone in the left ear stung.\nAnd 5 seconds later.\nThe words from Chun Yeowun’s mouth startled the dying man.\n“Yeon Company... Moyong clan.”\n‘!!!’\nThe leader’s eyes widened.\nIt was the same with Moyong Yi-sun, who was in a dark room inside the headquarters of the Yeon Company several kilometers away.\nKrrrr!\nMoyong Yi-sun, who thought the mission failed, tried to turn off the speaker while drenched in disappointment that he lost a useful tracker.\nThen, he heard a voice coming through.\n“H-How?”\nThe voice continued to enter his bewildered ears.\n“Let’s meet soon.”\nKwak!\nBeep!\nWith that, the sound was entirely cut off, as if the earphone was broken.\nShocked, Moyong Yi-sun was unable to move away for a while.\nThud!\nGeum Jung-so, who moved the dead bodies into a pit he dug, bit his lip.\nHe wondered if he would be surprised anymore.\nThis man wasn’t a cyborg like he saw in movies, but he never imagined that a person could trace a frequency by putting their hand on an earphone.\n‘Who is this person?’\nThis man was no longer a warrior who stayed hidden.\nNow, he was wondering if Chun Yeowun was a hidden agent created by the Chinese government or some top-secret group.\n‘This is insane!’\nHe was scared.\nHis heart was troubled.\nAs he pondered, he shook his head and opened the lid of something next to him.\n‘Ugh.’\nA foul odor wafted out.\nInside the barrel was sulfuric acid.\nAlthough they were on the outskirts, they couldn’t abandon dead bodies.\nFortunately, Ho Jeong was the kind to carry such things with him.\nSulfuric acid was one of them.\nDrop!\nShhhh!\nAll the acid was poured into the pit where the bodies were collected.\nThe reaction was so fast that the bodies immediately melted.\n“Ugh!”\nFrowning, he turned around.\nAfter taking care of everything which could be traced back to them, he got into the car.\nGeum Jong-so spoke to Chun Yeowun, who was sitting in the back seat.\n“For now, getting away from here is best.”\nThey couldn’t stay there any longer, not after what they had done.\nGeum Jong-so started the engine.\nIt was around 20 minutes after they started driving.\nChun Yeowun, who hadn’t said a single word, spoke.\n“We have come quite far, now start revealing your identity.”\n‘Damn it!’\nGeum Jong-so frowned.\nIt looked like Chun Yeowun knew something about his identity.\n‘Did Yun Mun-pyeong say something?’\nIt seemed like Yun Mun-pyeong had sent a message to him before they left.\nMaybe he knew his connection with the Public Security Bureau.\nAs he contemplated how to explain it, an unexpected question came out of Chun Yeowun’s mouth.\n“You... where did you learn that martial arts?”\n“Sorry?”\nGeum Jong-so stuttered at the unexpected question.\n“Wh-What do you mean?”\nHe didn’t think that he would be asked such a question.\nEven in Murim, people don’t ask about another person’s martial arts unless they are close.\nTo him, who was bewildered, Chun Yeowun said.\n“Stop acting like that. The martial arts that you unfolded back there belong to the Sky Demon Order’s Pure Kick Clan.”\n‘!!!’\nGeum Jong-so’s eyes trembled at those words.\n⁽¹⁾I use this in Deadbeat Noble to denote when something has been cut out by the author. In this case, it’s what Moyong Yi-sun says after “Woah.” I’ll be using this in any series I edit from now on.",

      "content": "Memories of the past flashed through Geum Jong-so’s mind.\nIn the middle of a dark night, a man with sparse grey hair hurriedly packed something.\nHe was carrying luggage and opened the door, when the young one saw that, the man stroked his hair.\n[Things have changed. I, no, we will do our very best to put everything back in place. Sigh... now you are the head of the family. Take good care of your mom.]\nHe raised his head and looked at the man with tears in his eyes.\nA face which was blurry even in his memory, the man bent down to the young one’s level and said.\n[... if I don’t make it back, forget all the memories you have of me. And live your life like an ordinary person.]\nAs the words kept coming, the tears which the young one was holding back began to flow.\nThe man with grey hair spoke with a sad voice this time.\n[If I knew this would happen, I would have passed everything down to you... no. This is better. This is the end. Unless it’s a real crisis, you should never reveal what you learned to anyone. If I don’t come back, move... remember. Goodbye, my son.] (*)\nPang!\nA small wave of qi stroked his head.\nHe was lost in his memory.\nGeum Jong-so looked at Chun Yeowun, unable to calm his emotions.\n‘What is this person’s identity?’\nIt has been 27 years already.\nContrary to his fears, no one recognized the martial arts he used.\nIt was as if the martial arts were erased from everyone’s mind.\n‘Damn it!’\nHe didn’t know how to deal with it.\nHe never dreamed that something found in Beijing would be recognized in Shenyang, which is closer to the border.\n‘Should I run away?’\nThat was a nice option, but impossible.\nThe nano bomb was in his body, and this monster would catch him even if not for the bomb.\nGeum Jong-so bit his lip.\nThere was no other option. He had to fight and run.\nKiik!\nGeum Jong-so parked the car.\nCars were passing by, but not many people were there.\nGeum Jong-so opened his mouth without turning his head.\n“... who are you?”\nHe just recognized his martial arts.\nEither an enemy or an ally.\nGeum Jong-so was quickly trying to judge the situation.\nHe was aware that nothing could be done.\nThe only hope he had was because of what Chun Yeowun said.\n‘No matter how many years have passed, there isn’t a single person in Murim who uses the expression Sky Demon Order anymore.’\nBlack Sky Company or Demonic Cult.\nOnly the members of the Order used the official name.\nWhile he was nervously looking into the mirror, Chun Yeowun said,\n“Come outside.”\nHe was puzzled, but he didn’t have much choice.\nGeum Jong-so stood in front of Chun Yeowun, who was standing to the right of the parked RV. He couldn’t even look into Chun Yeowun’s eyes.\nThat was when Chun Yeowun said.\n“The skills you learned, show them all.”\n“Huh?”\n“Don’t make me say it twice and unfold them.”\nGeum Jong-so frowned at the sudden request.\nAlthough it was said that there were a few people, cars only passed rarely, and using sword skills was still difficult.\n‘What is he thinking?’\nHe couldn’t figure it out.\nAfter hesitating for a while, he finally gave up.\nTaking a moment, his brilliant kick cut through the air, and the technique appeared.\nPapapapapak!\nGorgeous and quick kicks one after another.\nA martial art that couldn’t be seen by others, yet Geum Jong-so always trained.\nHe took pride in his secret martial art.\nWhen he was done, the words that came out of Chun Yeowun’s mouth were,\n“It’s a mess.”\nChun Yeowun shook his head with a disappointed look.\nHating those words, Geun Jong-so said.\n“What are you even talking about?”\nSurely the monster recognized the technique, but he couldn’t perform it, yet he called it a mess.\nChun Yeowun said,\n“I don’t know where you learned the technique, but why does the formation change so much with each attack? And where did you sell the other two techniques?”\n‘Ah?’\nGeum Jong-so’s expression changed.\nActually, he learned the technique at a very young age, when he was four or five, he himself wasn’t sure if he was doing it correctly.\nAnd he knew that it could be wrong too.\nBut in the end, the words, two techniques, caught his attention.\n“H-How do you know that?”\nIt was then.\nShhh!\n“Huh!”\nChun Yeowun suddenly grabbed his wrist.\nBefore he could even try to shake it off, energy penetrated through his wrist.\nWoong!\n“Euk!”\nIf he resisted the energy, he would end up with an internal injury.\nHe stood there without being able to fight the opponent.\nChun Yeowun, who scanned his body, finally said.\n“Why didn’t you learn the Pure Genuine Mind Method? No, it would have been better if you learned it.”\n‘!?’\nGeum Jong-so was at a loss for words.\nHe never imagined that someone would know about it.\nThe Pure Genuine Mind Method is paired with the Pure Kick that he had learned.\n“You are killing the technique.”\nIf Geum Jong-so knew the entire technique, he would use mind cultivation methods along with the technique, but he couldn’t.\nIt was because a certain internal energy cultivation method was needed to use the technique.\nGeum Jong-so asked with a trembling voice.\n“Wh-What the hell are you? How can you...”\nHe couldn’t understand.\nIt was embarrassing that someone else knew more about the technique than the heir of the clan.\nNo wonder he was shocked.\nThanks to Nano, Chun Yeowun had more than 70% of the Demonic Cult’s techniques in his head.\nAnd he even remembered the highest techniques of the other clans.\nIt was no exaggeration to say that Chun Yeowun is a moving martial arts technique book.\nThat’s one thing, but there’s another reason why Chun Yeowun understood it particularly.\n‘Baekgi.’\nIt was because of a martial artist Baekgi, one of the Six Swords and a supporter of Chun Yeowun.\nBaekgi, a member of the Six Swords, was one of the closest aides of Lord Chun Yeowun.\nHaving met someone who succeeded in his technique, Chun Yeowun couldn’t turn a blind eye.\n‘If Baekgi saw this, he would have been angry.’\nThis was nothing less than trash of a descendant of Baekgi, who was a perfectionist.\nMaybe the teaching wasn’t accurate.\n“W-Who are you? By any chance, do you know my father?”\nInstead of answering, Chun Yeowun asked,\n“Are you a descendant of the Pure Kick Clan of the main cult?”\nToo many questions.\nTo call it the main cult meant that Chun Yeowun was presenting himself as a member of the Sky Demon Order.\nGeum Jong-so, who heard that, spoke in a trembling voice.\n“Are you... are you really a senior in the cult?”\nThe voice was full of genuine welcoming.\nWhen he first heard the words ‘Sky Demon Order,’ he was confused and disturbed, thinking that the man was trying to lure him out.\n“Answer me.”\nWhen Chun Yeowun didn’t deny it, Geum Jong-so clasped his hands together.\nPak!\n“Geuk Jong-so of the Pure Kick Clan greets the senior!”\nBut as soon as the words were finished, Chun Yeowun made an abrupt action.\nGrab!\n“Kuak!”\nHe grabbed his neck.\nAt him, who was flustered, Chun Yeowun said.\n“Are you trying to deceive me till the end? If what you are saying now is true, you were never a member of the cult.”\nClench!\nGeum Jong-so’s eyes went wider as Chun Yeowun began to clench harder.\nOne last time, he wanted to test if Chun Yeowun is really a member of the Sky Demon Order, and it seemed to be true.\nGeum Jong-so opened his mouth with difficulty.\n“S-Senior, I was trying... to confirm... if you were... really from... the cult... I, I... apologize... keuk... apologize.”\nPak!\nWhen he said that, Chun Yeowun released his hand.\nDespite not being caught for a long time, Geum Jong-so coughed and then took the pose again while bowing his head.\n“Baek Jong-so of the Pure Kick Clan of the Great Sky Demon Order formally greets the senior!”\nRight.\nThe name wasn’t Geum, but Baek.\nGeum Jong-so or Baek Jong-so thought that if Chun Yeowun was really a member of the cult, he would realize the mistake in his name.\nIf Chun Yeowun accepted the first greeting, then he was an enemy.\nBut now, when he found out that the man in front of him really was a member of the Sky Demon Order, he couldn’t hold back his tears.\n“I am... I am really happy... to have met... the senior of the cult...”\nChun Yeowun smiled a little as he looked at Jong-so crying.\nHe was so worried when there were no traces of the Sky Demon Order, but he unexpectedly found a descendant of Baekgi, one of his closest aides.\n‘A descendant of Baekgi... this is nice.’\nFor the first time since he fell into the unknown time axis, he was happy.\nOf course, it wasn’t just about feeling good.\n“Why did a descendant of the Pure Kick Clan of the Great Sky Demon Order turn into a public security official?”\nChun Yeowun didn’t like the status of Baek Jong-so, who was an official yet a spy at the same time.\n‘Ah... he knew that too.’\nBaek Jong-so’s expression darkened.\nHe thought that he was just under suspicion, but it seemed like Yun Mun-pyeong noticed the truth.\nOtherwise, Chun Yeowun wouldn’t have known.\n“There were... some circumstances.”\n“Circumstances?”\nHis voice was mixed with anger.\nIt seemed like the descendant had some kind of problem.\nChun Yeowun was about to ask, but Baek Jong-so said,\n“Senior. Before that, would it be fine if this junior asked something?”\nJong-so had something he was really curious about.\nIf Chun Yeowun knew his martial arts this well, he guessed that he should be related to his father or someone higher in the Sky Demon Order.\n“I permit you.”\nAs the permission fell, Baek Jong-so asked.\n“Thank you. Actually, I’m sorry for referring to you as just senior, so I would like to ask you about your name or title when the Black Sky Company was still alive.”\nHe wondered about his real identity.\nDespite him being young in the past, Jong-so still remembered the names of several people his father was close to.\nSince he didn’t remember the face, he thought he might remember something if his title or name came up.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun didn’t answer.\nShhh!\nThe black handguard on his right wrist gently changed.\nChachachachachacha!\nIt was shocking.\nAs the blackguard moved, it took the form of a sword.\nBaek Jong-so’s eyes widened at the appearance of the exquisite sword, which was giving out a black hue.\n“This, this is...”\nBaek Jong-so’s two eyes were staring at the text written in the middle of the black sword.\nSky Demon Sword\n‘!!!’\nFor a moment, it felt like a thrill ran through his body.\nHe fell onto his knees and cried out.\n“Baek Jong-so greets the current Chun Ma of the Great Sky Demon Order!”",

      "content": "5 years old.\nHe wasn’t old enough to remember things.\nThe face was blurry, and most of those memories were erased after he reached his thirties.\nBut there are things which humans never forget.\nThe Sky Demon Order, which has a long history, has several legends running around it.\nWhen Baek Jong-so was young, he fell asleep while listening to the stories that his father told.\nEven when he was this old, he vaguely remembered it.\n[When the disappeared Sky Demon Sword and its owner appear, the glory of the Sky Demon Order will soar above the sky.]\nThat was the legend, though it wasn’t taken seriously.\nLike how a child believes that Santa Claus exists, there was a time when he believed that the man with the Sky Demon Sword would appear one day.\n‘A legend.’\nBut with age, it changed.\nWhen he witnessed the legend buried in the corner of his mind as the Black Sky Company disintegrated and he wandered aimlessly, he was overcome with emotions.\n‘To see the Sky Demon Sword with my own eyes!’\nTears!\nBaek Jong-so’s two eyes were becoming heavy and swollen.\nNo one knew just how many times he had cried.\nTo him, the existence of Chun Ma was no less than a god.\nWhile a vehicle from the outskirts entered the northern city of Shenyang, Baek Jong-so told Chun Yeowun everything he knew.\n“My father, the head, left my mother and me to wander aimlessly for years.”\nThe news of his father, who was supposed to return but suddenly didn’t come.\nLess than a week later, the young kid left Beijing with his mother.\n“I was young, but one thing is certain.”\n“You were being chased.”\nAs Chun Yeowun said, Baek Jong-so was pursued.\nThey couldn’t settle down for almost five years and had to move from place to place every two to three months, or sometimes every day or two.\n“Then we came to Shenyang.”\nThis shared a close border with the Korean government and was farthest from Central China.\nThere were more branches of the Public Security and Murim Association, but it was better than Central China.\n“But that didn’t mean that it was without risks.”\nIt was only five years ago that everything became fine.\nBut, the face of Baek Jong-so was known to some extent.\nThanks to that, the situation of not being able to settle happened, but it only happened inside Shenyang.\n“At that time, my adoptive father reached out to us.”\n“He must have been the one who taught you that martial arts.”\nThe martial arts that Baek Jong-so first used. The one Chun Yeowun had no idea about.\nIt incorporated boldly striking the opponent’s face. It was quite a crude technique.\n“Must be from the Forces of Evil.”\nAt those words, Baek Jong-so bit his tongue.\nHe knew it from the first time he saw it, despite being Chun Ma, the man was really clever.\n“He was one of the middle bosses of Black Wolf group, one of the four organizations of the Forces of Evil in Shenyang. My adoptive father was quite well known in the Forces of Evil.”\nSomehow, they managed to avoid the eyes of the pursuers.\nAs a result, he had no choice but to come into contact with people of the other world unintentionally. Then finally, the adoptive man decided to officialize the relationship.\n“At first, he was only trying to arrange the place for us to hide, but fell in love with my mother and actively pursued her. He’s a great person.”\nBecause he liked the woman, whom no one believed in.\nPerhaps that was the reason.\nPerhaps his mother was too tired of running away.\n“He asked my mother to let him be a part of my life but said he had no intention of taking away my actual father’s memories, and that is how my family turned out.”\nThe following story could be predicted.\nAs he was from the other world, the adoptive father helped wash away the identity of Baek Jong-so and his mother. He introduced a professional mask maker to her, as she refused to undergo plastic surgery.\n‘He knew.’\nThe fact that Baek Jong-so knew a mask maker was true.\nBaek Jong-so continued to speak.\n“And 15 years after the mess, peace came to my mother and me.”\nBut that didn’t last long.\nBaek Jong-so’s adoptive father was killed in a war with another organization inside the Forces of Evil, the Fire Head.\nFortunately, there was an unwritten rule that among those in organizations, families are to be left untouched, but still, the loss of a family member was too shocking for them.\n‘Fire Head....’\nChun Yeowun stroked his chin.\n“... from that day on, I had to do all sorts of odd jobs to make a living.”\nAs he had lived the life as a fugitive and the son of a boss of the Forces of Evil, he naturally came closer to the dark side of the world than the light side.\nHis means of livelihood was stealing.\n“I didn’t have any intention of doing it.”\nThe reason he stole, there was a reason why he entered the house of an executive of the Public Security.\n“My mother never told me anything about my father, or the ancestors or the Black Sky Company.”\nUntil the age of 20, Baek Jong-so had a lot of friction with his mother because of it.\nHowever, as time passed, he realized that he couldn’t just bring up the story of the Sky Demon Order to his mother.\n“In the end, I had no choice but to figure out how it collapsed.”\nHe believed that the Public Security too was involved in the dissolution of the Black Sky Company.\nSo he searched the homes of officials of the Public Security.\n“But I was in a pinch, with no parents, and I needed to make money.”\nBaek Jong-so robbed the house of a Public Security official while trying to dig up information.\nIn this era, expensive items were put on the black market as earning cash would make it traceable.\nThe first time was difficult, but the second and third times not so much.\nAt some point, he turned into a professional thief until he was caught.\n“... I was such an idiot. I didn’t even foresee that they would go after my mother once they got me.”\nClench!\nBaek Jong-so grabbed the steering wheel.\nHis teary eyes could be seen.\n‘Was that the reason?’\n/strong>\nAnd that was how he turned into a spy for the Public Security and infiltrated the Six Road Toys.\nWith his mother being held hostage, he had no choice.\n‘In the end, it’s always the same.’\nChun Yeowun shook his head.\nEven the Public Security, called the official government of this era, didn’t hesitate to act dirty.\nBarely managing to calm his emotions, Baek Jon-so said.\n“You are currently Chun Ma. I know that this might be disrespectful, but I’m not capable of rescuing my mother, who is being held captive. That is why I’m in this situation, but my mother is a member of the cult.”\nBaek Jong-so wanted to hold onto even the shortest straw.\nHe knew how burdensome it would be to ask someone else to rescue his mother, who is being held hostage inside the Public Security. Still, even then, he wanted to lean on the one called Chun Ma.\n‘Current Chun Ma....’\nActually, it’s supposed to be 2nd generation Chun Ma.\nOf course, Baek Jong-so couldn’t know that Chun Yeowun had time travelled.\nAnd Chun Yeowun didn’t want to say it either.\nThere was insufficient trust between them to reveal such sensitive facts.\n“My mother is more aware of the cult’s circumstances than I am. If Chun Ma helps, she will be more helpful than....”\n“Enough.”\n“Sorry?”\nBaek Jong-so’s face darkened.\nIf Chun Ma didn’t help, then there was no way to save his mother.\nThat was when Chun Yeowun said.\n“How do you get in contact with them?”\n“Ah!”\nThe disappointed face brightened up.\nBecause he knew what it meant.\n“A-Are you really going to help?”\n“Don’t make me say it twice.”\n‘He’s so nice!’\nOnce again, he was emotional.\nIt had been a long time since his adoptive father died and since he last felt the feeling of dependability and trust in someone.\nChun Yeowun clicked his tongue and said.\n“You are not even a homemaker, so stop crying.” ⁽¹⁾\n“Yep!”\nKiik!\nBaek Jong-so responded, and turned the steering wheel to the left and took a U-turn.\nChun Yeowun looked into the front mirror with puzzled eyes when Baek Jong-so spoke with a smile.\n“Isn’t there a place we need to stop by before that?”\n“Hmm.”\nChun Yeowun looked at himself.\nHis trademark is long hair which comes down to his waist.\n“The body, hair, and skin are from one’s parents, so keeping them away from harm is the beginning of filial duty.”\nThat was the saying of the nobles.\nCutting it would be terrifying for people in the age that Chun Yeowun was from.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun was a Murim warrior who wasn’t bound by the nobles’ doctrines.\n‘I’m not used to it.’\nHis appearance was awkward.\nSince this era’s information was transferred into his brain, he couldn’t help but realize that his long hair keeps drawing too much attention.\n‘... it isn’t just that.’\nChun Yeowun looked around with annoyed eyes.\nFrom a woman called a hairstylist who cuts hair to the women around who were squinting their eyes, Chun Yeowun thought that the information he got from Nano wasn’t accurate.\n‘Yah! Indeed, a man’s life is his hair.’\n‘Isn’t he so cool?’\n‘I thought he was some rockstar, but it doesn’t look like that. It doesn’t look like he’s from some large corporation either. Ah. Look at the white skin. He’s totally my style.’\n‘Yeah, you have a boyfriend.’\nHowever, he soon found out the reason for the gazes.\nEven though they were whispering, they could be heard.\nHe looked difficult to approach because of his sharp eyes, but Chun Yeowun was quite tall and had a handsome face.\n“Hmm.”\nHe came to the side of Baek Jong-so, who was waiting for him.\n“It’s all done. I did the calculations beforehand.”\nAnd then he looked at Chun Yeowun, who looked at his reflection with a puzzled look.\nHe really didn’t want to get his haircut.\n‘... does he hate it?’\nThat said, his lips slowly raised.\nA grey RV driving on the road.\nChun Yeowun was changed with the new hairstyle.\nA black suit, shoes and a long coat from a department store turned him into a fashion icon of the era.\nJudging from the outward appearance and the aura he gave off, he looked like a charismatic young CEO.\nIt was difficult at first, but the end result pleased Chun Yeowun too.\n‘It will take a while to get used to it.’\nSince they bought extra suits, there wouldn’t be any problems for a while.\nThe clothes he wore were folded and kept in the department store’s bag.\nSo that he could wear it when he gets back to his original era.\nBee! Beep! Beep! Beep!\nThe phone didn’t connect.\nBaek Jong-so was feeling troubled.\nFinally, he tried to call the mask expert but couldn’t contact them either.\nWell, it wasn’t a typical story. It was a place run by someone from the other world, so visiting wouldn’t work if not contacted in advance.\n“It’s strange. We should be in touch by now.”\n“Is there some problem?”\n“Hm... it seems like he isn’t there.”\n“Really?”\n“Or, should we just go there?”\nChun Yeowun shook his head at the question.\nHe needed the best mask, and he wasn’t in a hurry right now.\nSome things had to be done before that.\n“Rather, is there a place for training and stuff?”\n“Sorry? Training?”\n“You practice martial arts too, so you must have a place to train.”\n“Ah....”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, Baek Jong-so remembered a place.\nThe house he initially lived in.\nAlthough his adoptive father belonged to the Forces of Evil, he was a warrior and designed his home for training.\nBut there was one problem.\n“The place where my home is, there may be CCTV cameras and wiretapping devices installed by the Bureau.”\nThey must have been installed by the Public Security for surveillance when his mother was taken.\n“After infiltrating the Six Road Toys’ as a secret mission, I was staying at their hideout, so I haven’t been there in a while, but it’s probably the same.”\n“Hm. Okay? Then that works.”\n“Yes?”\n“Let’s go to your house.”\n“Hm... yes”\nBaek Jong-so was skeptical of Chun Yeowun’s instructions, but he decided to go along with it for the time being.\nIn his head, he hoped that they would go and contact the Public Security to find a way to save his mother, but he decided to stay silent and not nag at Chun Ma.\nOne hour later,\nBaek Jong-so’s house was located in the southern part of Shenyang city.\nIt looked like an ordinary house from outside, but when entered, there was a training room of 49 meters.\nThe floor, which had been made with cement, was full of traces of water.\nHowever, on one side of the training room was an unusual machine.\nIt was round like a barrel, and there was a cushion on the floor of its center. It was enough space for one person to enter and sit cross-legged.\n‘What is that?’\n‘Unknown’\nAt Chun Yeowun’s question, Nano revealed that it didn’t have any data regarding it.\nBewildered, Baek Jong-so scratched his head and said.\n“This is a little outdated, but it’s good for meditation. My adoptive father spent a lot of money to buy that.”\n“For meditation?”\n“Yes. It’s an old model, but even then, it’s okay. Um... is this your first time seeing this?”\nBaek Jong-so’s eyes went wide.\nNaturally, he thought that there was no way for a person like Chun Yeowun to be unaware of this.\nBut he really didn’t know?\nBaek Jong-so was puzzled and approached the machine and pressed the button on it.\nWoong!\nThe LED lights attached to the top of the cylinder turned on, and the machine began to work.\nAt that moment, even Chun Yeowun couldn’t hide his surprise.\nThe moment the machine began, the energy of nature was condensing inside that cylinder.\n[Pure energy is condensing into the interior of the mechanical device.]\n‘Yes. I know.’\nChun Yeowun was more sensitive to the flow of energy than Nano.\nTo Chun Yeowun, who was shocked, Baek Jong-so said.\n“It’s just a meditation point, but the effect of circulating the energy is weak, but if you go inside, you can probably see the effect.”\nThe purpose of the device was to just assist during internal energy cultivation.\nAt that time, Chun Yeowun nodded his head as he was curious about it.\nHe was someone who had thought that the energy in nature had faded away in this era, and that was why it wasn’t enough for the Murim warriors to build up their levels.\nBut he never dreamed that such a device existed.\n‘Nano. If you don’t know, that means that this is definitely a different time axis.’\nThis was shocking.\nThe era of Nano was farther away.\nHowever, even in that era, the level of the warriors was terribly low because there were no such devices for internal energy.\n‘This is interesting. The gaps can be filled in this way.’\nIn a way, he wanted to praise the wisdom of the later generations.\n“Is this device used by most Murim warriors?”\n“Umm. Well, not entirely. I don’t know the exact information because people used to pay a lot for the old models and buy them, but maybe only half of the Murim. Other than this, some supplements are available at a lower cost. But those too are expensive in a way.”\nIn this era, the Murim seemed to make significant investments to obtain internal energy.\nAs a result, they had to make a living and earn money.\nLooking at the device, Baek Jong-so felt fortunate.\n‘This is the only help we got from the CCTV cameras they installed.’\nSince it’s such a precious device, it would have been stolen long ago.\nDespite being a vacant house for such a long time, because of the surveillance of the Public Security, the device stayed here.\nBaek Jong-so asked in telepathy.\n[But, why did you want to come... ah....]\nBaek Jong-so, who was trying to ask something, went silent.\nCome to think of it. He wasn’t sure if the Bureau had some kind of device that could tap into their telepathic messages.\nIt was when he was thinking about what to do.\nPapak!\n“Kuak!”\nAt the sudden sealing of his blood points, Baek Jong-so fell to the floor.\nHe was unable to speak or move because his blood points were sealed.\nChun Yeowun looked down at him with a subtle expression.\n‘W... why’\nBaek Jong-so’s eyes trembled.\nA house about 500 yards away.\nIt looked like just another house, but the inside was different.\nThere were around ten men in uniforms, people of the Public Security Bureau, and three men in regular clothes monitoring.\nA man in grey jumper crossed his arms and looked at the man behind him, who was in his 40s with saggy cheeks, and said,\n“Team leader! Look at the living room monitor!”\nAt those words, the team leader with saggy cheeks looked at the CCTV screen.\nBaek Jong-so was lying on the floor.\n“What happened there?”\n“He seems to have been hit by an undercover person.”\n“I know that too. No. Why did he turn up there all of a sudden? Turn up the volume.”\n“Yes.”\nTatatak!\nThe man in front of the monitor tapped the keyboard.\nThe voice from the wiretapping device in the living room grew louder.\nA low-pitched voice could be heard.\n-Don’t blame it. It’s the Public Security.\n‘!?’\nThe three people who were listening went stiff.\nIt seemed like the man inside the house discovered them.\nThey had to report an emergency.\n-Well, thanks anyway. If you report to the Public Security, they will come and take care of me.\nAt those words, the team leader frowned.\n‘Isn’t he completely caught?’\nApparently, it seemed like there was only one infiltrator, and his identity was known by the one who had fallen.\nWhich meant that something had to be done.\nIt was then.\nPak!\nChun Yewun placed his palm towards the dantian point of Baek Jong-so.\nAnd mumbled.\n-Since you are going to die. I might as well take ‘it’ from your body.\nAs soon as the people heard that, the team leader got up and shouted.\n“This is insane! It looks like that bastard knows how to do Dantian Energy Absorption. Send the crew in and arrest him!”\nDantian Energy Absorption.\nIt was a type of technique where one could forcibly absorb another person’s qi.\nIt wasn’t a normal way of taking internal energy, and it had side effects too. Still, for a short period of time, it was effective. There are people inside the Forces of Evil who have learned it from time to time.\nHowever, it was a very objectionable technique to the other Murim people, so even people of the Forces of Evil didn’t use it.\nClap!\nAt the command of their team leader, the team took out their machine guns and boarded a black van outside the house—the bus carried them to the house quickly.\n“Shit. How did this happen?”\nThe team leader was nervous at the thought that if he didn’t hurry, the infiltrator would run.\nIf the identity of the Six Road Toys was discovered, but their spy didn’t find it out, he had to be rescued.\nKwang!\nThe Mobile Strike Team quickly came out of the bus, which arrived in front of Baek Jong-so’s home.\nKwang!\nThey broke the front door of the house and entered the yard.\nFour mobile strikers pulled something out from their waists.\nAnesthetic gas bombs.\n“Throw!”\nCrrr!\nThe windows were broken, and the gas bombs were thrown in.\nPusss!\nIt was set to emit gas so that the entire place would be filled with thick smoke.\nHelmed mobile strikers rushed in.\nTak!\nThe team leader took out a gas mask from a silver case and put it on his face.\nThen he pulled out his gun and tried to move.\nIt was then.\nKuak!\nKuak!\nAck!\nScreams could be heard from the wireless earphone he was wearing.\nThe team leader couldn’t hide his shock.\n“Wh-What is this?”\nThey had thrown in the anesthetic bombs.\nIf the infiltrator inhaled it, then he should have been weak.\nBut, there seemed to be some problem.\nWhooo!\nKuak!\nAt the screams which followed, the team leader hesitated about what had to be done.\nHe had to go in to figure out what was happening, but he didn’t want to suffer like those inside were.\n“Damn it! First of all, we need to retreat. San-young! Start the bu...”\n“Team leader!”\nTeam member San-young hurriedly shouted.\nTak!\nThe eyes of the team leader flickered.\nSomeone gently placed a hand on his shoulder, making an eerie feeling run down his body.\nBiting his lip, he turned his head.\n‘Wh-How is....’\nChun Yeowun placed his hand on his shoulder.\nWith a smile on his face, he spoke to the team leader, who had turned pale.\n“Look at this.”\n‘What!?’\nThat was when the team leader knew.\nThat this was a trap.\n⁽¹⁾Homemaker meaning “a person, especially a housewife, who manages a home.”",

      "content": "Inside the bus that the agents of the Public Security were riding.\n“Ugh...”\nBaek Jon-so groaned as if the gas he had inhaled wasn’t properly removed.\nHe had inhaled the gas from the anesthetic bombs as he was in a state where his blood points were sealed, and as a result, he was experiencing numbness.\nFortunately, there was an antidote, and he managed to take it, but his body was still a mess.\nHis internal energy had depleted.\n‘He hid it from me too. Ha...’\nBaek Jong-so clicked his tongue as he shook his head.\nAt the same time, he thought.\n‘How could he use the surveillance cameras and wiretapping devices this way? He is as smart as a spy.’\nThanks to Chun Yeowun’s mind, the Public Security Bureau’s mobile strike team was caught.\nIn a way, he thought it was for the best that he wasn’t told the plan, as his reaction was more natural.\n“Kuak!”\nThat was when he heard a groan.\nBaek Jong-so got out of the bus and looked.\n‘Are there twelve people?’\nThe man in a grey jumpsuit was clenching his teeth, trying to overcome the pain.\nPuck!\nThe finger dug into the man’s right shoulder came out.\nThe pain was unbearable.\nChun Yeowun was the one who inflicted such pain on him.\n“Kuaaa... ugh... ackkkk...”\nThe man let out a ragged and raspy breath as the finger was pulled out.\nGlaring at Chun Yeowun, he shouted.\n“Haa... haa... haaa... you bastard! Do you think that we’ll start talking if you torture us like this?”\nChun Yeowun nodded at his words.\nSurely these people were well trained in enduring torture.\nFrom ten mobile strikers to two agents in civilian clothes, he had inflicted the same pain on them all, but no one spoke.\n‘Hmm.’\nOf course, to some extent, Chun Yeowun changed the severity of torture.\nIf he was in the Murim era, he would have plucked out their nails or cut off their fingers one by one, but now he just used his finger to penetrate their flesh.\nIf Chun Yeowun’s former subordinates saw this, they might have said, ‘Our Lord has become gentle.’\n“Well, your mouth seems too heavy for you to speak. Then should we see if your boss will be the same as you?” (1)\n“You jerk...”\nPuck!\nThe man who was drenched in blood lost consciousness.\nChun Yeowun turned his head.\nThe team leader with saggy cheeks was looking at him with a pale face.\nAs he watched his team members suffer one after the other helplessly, this was a natural reaction.\n‘Shit, that wicked bastard!’\nThe team leader still couldn’t help falling into the trap Chun Yeowun laid.\nBut he wasn’t the kind to blame himself and feel bad.\nThat was when Chun Yeowun approached him and asked.\n“I will ask you the same question. As long as you answer, I will send you away.”\nAs soon as he said that, the index finger of Chun Yeowun touched the right shoulder of the team leader.\nThe team leader’s breathing quickened.\n‘Fuck. The guys have endured this, and if I can’t stand this, it’ll be shameful for me.’\nChun Yeowun asked.\n“Geum Jong-so’s mother. Where did you hide her?”\n“... don’t, I don’t know.”\n“Yeah. Right.”\nPuck!\nChun Yeowun’s finger pierced the team leader’s shoulder.\nHe was prepared for it, but the pain was too great.\n“Kuaaak!”\nHe seemed to understand why the other agents had clenched their teeth.\n“Fuck! Fuck!”\nIt was just one finger, yet he was cursing.\nAs soon as Chun Yeowun’s finger came out of his flesh, the clothes near his shoulder were soaked in blood.\nNow, the finger went to his left shoulder.\n“Once again. Guem Jong-so’s mother. Where did you hide her?”\n“Shut up... fuck! I don’t know you bastar...”\nPuck!\n“Kuaak!”\nAnother scream with the finger digging in.\nWith an expressionless face, Chun Yeowun had his finger on the thigh this time.\n“Geum Jong-so’s mother. Where did you hide her?”\nThe team leader’s face turned red as he urgently shouted.\n“Wait! Wait!”\n“Are you going to answer?”\n“You bastard... do you think you can handle the aftereffects of this?”\n“That isn’t the answer I want.”\nPuck!\nChun Yeowun tried to push his finger in again.\nStartled, the team leader shouted.\n“D-Do you have time to torture us like this?”\nChun Yeowun looked puzzled as he asked.\n“... what are you saying?”\nThe team leader, who thought that he had drawn his attention, spoke in a calm voice.\n“You made a mistake.”\n“Mistake?”\n“Do you think that if you destroy all the cameras and devices in the home, no one will know?”\nAs he said, the room was a mess.\nIt was because Chun Yeowun had removed all the devices.\nThe team leader, convinced that his words worked on Chun Yeowun, spoke with a sly smile.\n“Do you think we are the only ones looking at the camera feed? You pretend to be smart, but you are stupid. You broke them and thought that no one would notice? Hah! All the power in the Public Security Bureau should be coming to this place at any moment.”\n“That’s such a bluff.”\n“Kuak, you think I’m bluffing? Why do you think they kept silent despite being tortured? They all waited patiently for the reinforcements to arrive!”\nChun Yeowun looked into the man’s eyes.\nHis eyes were trembling, but he looked confident.\nJust then. Baek Jong-so came into the living room.\nWhen Chun Yeowun looked at him, Baek Jong-so nodded.\n“You’re lucky.”\nTak!\nChun Yeowun lifted his finger from the thigh.\nAnd leaving him alone, he left the house.\nEventually, the sound of the engine starting was heard from outside, along with the sound of the car departing. The team leader sighed in relief.\n“Sigh... haaa....”\nHe was afraid of being introduced to the same pain again.\nHe felt fortunate that his improvisation worked.\n‘I’m glad I deceived him.’\nIn fact, it was a lie to say that the Bureau would come.\nDespite being in the Bureau, this team operated secretly.\nFor that reason, all the equipment and information have been disconnected from the headquarters.\nAnd that was why Chun Yeowun tortured them, yet no one gave the information.\n‘Haha... still, I’m glad that everyone here is safe. I need to tell the head that the spy planted in the Six Road Toys is... oh... what?’\nSuddenly, something was odd.\nNo matter how much he had bluffed about the bureau, it was suspicious how all of them were spared.\n‘Damn it! I would have been hurt more!’\nThe team leader wriggled his body and picked up a piece of broken glass that had fallen on the ground.\nHe had to cut the ropes which were restraining his hands and feet.\nThe team leader, who barely released himself, woke up his agents.\n“T-Team leader! You’re safe.”\n“We don’t have time for small talk. We’ll talk inside the bus and wake everyone up.”\nAt the impatient attitude of the team leader, the agent nodded and woke the others up.\nWhen everyone woke up, they hurried into the van.\nThe bus departed, and the team leader explained what happened.\nAgent San-young spoke with a happy face.\n“You’re such a reliable person! Indeed you’re amazing, sir! I thought that they were smart but how stupid. If they punctured the tires of the bus, we would have wasted more time too. Tch tch. They’re stupid.”\nThe team leader scolded him.\n“They aren’t stupid. They didn’t puncture the tires on purpose.”\n“Sorry?”\n“We were almost deceived. He’s a really clever one.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“They let us go on purpose. They pretended to have gotten tricked by us as none of the equipment we had was traceable.”\nAt first, the team leader thought that he had deceived Chun Yeowun.\nBut then, it seemed strange.\nA person bold enough to kidnap them wouldn’t give up so easily.\nEven if not for Chun Yeowun, Geum Jong-so, who was in his party, should be emotionally outraged by them giving up on his mother, but he was calm too.\n“Then why? Can’t he go to where the chief is?”\n“There’s no way that clever bastard will go after them right away. Uhm. He must have installed a tracking device in the bus.”\n“Damn it. Quickly search for the tracking device!”\nSurprised by those words, San-young gave the order to the others.\nThe team leader shook his head.\n“Stop. They aren’t idiots. They didn’t install them in visible places. First, let’s head to the nearest repair shop.”\n“Roger.”\nThe man driving searched for a place in the navigation system.\nThe team leader wiggled his fingers with an anxious face.\nThey had to rush to a repair shop. Remove the device and contact their chief.\nShenyang, Public Security Bureau Director’s office.\nDirector Sang Yu-geun, who was holding a radio, was stiff.\nA man’s voice could be heard from it, but it was hoarse.\n-Click! Director. What should I do? They are at the repair shop and waiting for instructions.\nAt that, the director stroked his chin.\nHe got a report of the situation, which was completely different from what he expected, and it complicated his mind.\n‘Is it him again?’\nWhen the order to investigate was given, he never expected it to turn out like this.\nHe predicted that there would be problems, especially since he held the man’s mother and asked him to act like a spy.\n‘What an annoying one you are.’\nHe looked at the picture of Chun Yeowun on his desk.\nLike a loach, he was taking away everything the director planned.\n‘I don’t know what kind of trick you used, but you crossed a line you shouldn’t have.’\nAnd if such a person was left alone, more problems would crop up.\nHaving made a decision, the director pressed the button on the radio and said.\n“Superintendent. Have the team leader stop them from disabling the tracking device.”\n-Click! Sorry? What is that?\n“If the Six Road Toys know he’s a spy, then he is of no use to us.”\n-Click!.... Are you throwing him away?\nSuperintendent Neung’s voice was heavy.\nIt wasn’t that he was feeling regret or guilt about discarding the man, but it was disappointing that all the hard work they did would be in vain.\n“Isn’t that why we used him?”\n-Click. Yes.\n“I’ll send you a location, so have the team leader guide them there and gather the 4th and 5th teams and the special agents too.”\n-Click! Yes!\n“Ah! The tech team just sent me some good stuff. I will send the file now.”\nDirector Sang Yu-geun turned on his monitor screen.\nA line that looked like a frequency and things like numbers were written underneath it.\n[The detonation code of the MS bomb.]\nThe file’s identity was the frequency code for the nano bomb.\nLooking at the screen, the director muttered.\n“I never thought that it would be used this way. Tch.”\nAt the same time.\nAn RV not far from the Public Security Bureau.\nInside was a man intently listening to something through earphones.\nIt was Lee Myeong, the 3rd team leader of the violent crimes squads, who was suspended.\n-I never thought that it would be used this way. Tch.\nIt was the voice of the director of Public Security that was coming in through the earphones.\nLee Myeong had installed a wiretapping device in the director’s office.\nAs he was suspicious of the director the day he visited the office, Lee Myeong had secretly installed the device.\n“Sigh...”\nThis man was freaking out.\nThis wiretapping device was a cheap product, yet unimaginable information came out of it.\n“Damn it! What the hell is he doing?”\nHe couldn’t help but feel disappointed when he discovered the other side of the Bureau, which he never knew of.\nHe thought the director was hiding something, but he never expected that words of destroying someone would come out of his mouth so easily. (*)\nLee Myeong, who was worried, immediately turned the car around.\nBrrr!\nOne hour later.\nThe southern outskirts of Shenyang city.\nNot far from the wall of an abandoned factory.\nMost of the factories around seemed to have been destroyed by bombs, and there was only one unbroken.\nAs the sun went down, the dark abandoned factory looked like a ghost residence.\nKiik!\nThe door to the closed factory opened.\nThe sound of two pairs of footsteps entering.\nStep, step!\nIt was when the footsteps moved to the center.\nBang!\nThe opened door closed.\nAt the same time.\nPat!\nLED lights turned on in the abandoned building, the dark space became bright.\nThe lights in the middle showed two people, Chun Yeowun and Baek Jong-so.\n“Don’t Move!”\n“You are under arrest!”\nClink! Clink!\nNumerous mobile strikers revealed themselves.\nMore than sixty people aimed their machine guns at the two men from the second floor.\n[T-Too many.]\nShocked, Baek Jong-so sent a message to Chun Yeowun.\nThey came here following the tracking device, just as the Public Security expected.\nThey knew that people would be hidden inside, but there were too many.\n“Puahahahah!”\nThen he heard a laugh.\nThree men appeared among the mobile strikers.\nOne familiar face.\nIt was the man who was tortured by Chun Yeowun a little while back.\n“Neung Do-myung!”\nBaek Jong-so looked at the man next to the team leader with furious eyes.\nHowever, the other man called out.\n“Geum Jong-so...”\nIt felt sorrowful.\nThe small, short middle-aged man with sad eyes was Neung Do-myung. One of the two superintendents of the Public Security Bureau’s special task force.\nThe one who put Baek Jong-so into the Six Road Toys as a spy.\n‘Hmm.’\nChun Yeoun’s looked at someone else.\nUnlike the mobile strikers holding firearms, one man with curly hair held a grey sword and stared at Chun Yeowun.\nThe one leading these men stepped forward and talked as if he enjoyed the moment.\n“Stupid bastards. Did you think that we would be deceived by such nonsense?”\nWith those words, the team leader threw something on the floor.\nTring!\nBaek Jong-so frowned.\nIt was the tracking device they had installed on the bus.\nThe team leader pointed to Chun Yeowun and spoke with a smile.\n“Haha. I’ll pay you back for before. It’ll be really good.”\nEditor’s Note -\n(1) “Well, your mouth seems too heavy for you to speak.” This means that he is hard to crack through torture. He’s basically saying that since he’s not breaking, his mouth must be too heavy to speak with.",

      "content": "The eyes of the team leader, Go, looked at Chun Yeowun.\nJudging by the fact that he even pointed and spoke emotionally, it seemed like he was very angry about being tortured.\nChun Yeowun looked at the team leader with his usual expression and tried to step forward.\n“Stop. It would be in your best interest to not take a single step from there.”\nPak!\nTeam leader Go hurriedly held out something he was holding in his hand.\nA small monitor with a terminal.\n“Why should I?”\nThe team leader shouted at Chun Yeowun, who didn’t understand what the monitor was.\n“I heard that you’re a Superior Master, so you must be brave. But how far will that attitude take you?”\nClick!\nThe team leader pressed one of the two buttons on the terminal.\nWith a frequency line appearing on the monitor, a warning sound was heard.\nBeep! Beep! Beep! Beep!\nIt was the sound of a detector.\nThe team leader spoke with a smile on his face.\n“Can you hear that? That’s the sound of your death alarm.”\nAt that time, superintendent Neung Do-myung, who was next to him, reached out with a gesture to pause.\n“Geum Jong-so. Why did you make this choice?”\nAt the sorrowful question from Neung Do-myung, Baek Jong-so answered with a loud voice.\n“Is the man who took my mother as collateral really asking that?”\n“You’re a fool.”\nNeung Do-myung shook his head.\nAt the sound of the terminal, Baek Jong-so asked in a low voice.\n“... what kind of trick is this?”\n“Trick? This is the thing you asked for.”\n“What?”\nBaek Jong-so was shocked.\nIf his words were true, then they currently had the terminal which could control the nano bomb in his body.\nSeeing Baek Jong-so scared, Neung Do-myung continued.\n“We secured research from MS. Stupid bastard. Did you think that we would let you go so easily?”\n‘I can’t... you made a code to unlock the bomb?’\nBaek Jong-so couldn’t hide his shock.\nThey always said that they were trying, so he thought the Bureau had given up on him.\nHowever, if his words were true, the Public Security was really trying to disarm the nano bomb.\n“Do you realize the mistake you made?”\nNeung Do-myung asked Baek Jong-so, who was confused.\n‘I’m sorry. If you hadn’t strayed off the path, such trouble wouldn’t be here.’\nActually, something was untrue.\nIn the file sent by the director, there was only the code to detonate the bomb, not disarm it.\nWhen asked if the code could disarm, the director said it would take time.\nIt was because they had just managed to secure the frequency of the bombs.\nBut this alone was enough to shake Baek Jong-so.\n“I will give you a chance though. Destroy the dantian of the person next to you and redeem yourself.”\n‘!?’\nBaek Jong-so’s face hardened at those words.\nWith his life on the line, they were asking him to betray someone.\n“You! What are you saying....”\n“The order came from above to destroy you. As your identity has been discovered by the Six Road Toys, you are of no use to us. Besides, you betrayed us.”\n“T-That...”\n“I don’t want to hear your excuses. But after reflecting on the past I decided that I’ll ignore the order from my superiors and give you a chance. If your loyalty is proven, I will try to get the higher-ups to reconsider.”\n“Giving me... a chance?”\n“Shouldn’t you be alive to see your mother? Are you going to die first?”\nDespite his soft words, it was nothing less than a threat.\nGrunt!\nBaek Jong-so was unable to hold back his anger.\nDespite being a member of the bureau, Neung Do-myung had the tongue of a snake.\nFrom the first time they met, he knew that he was being pushed into a pit that couldn’t be climbed up.\n‘You don’t have a choice. Geum Jong-so. The answer has been decided.’\nA smile crept across his face.\nBaek Jong-so turned his head and looked at Chun Yeowun.\nThis man was like a God to the members of the Sky Demon Order.\nAnd this man was his only hope to see the truth behind the sudden dissolution of the Black Sky Company.\n‘If I sacrifice this person to save my life, will I get to see my mother?’\nHe didn’t have to think.\nHe was the head of the Pure Kick Clan, which was under the Great Sky Demon Order.\nTremble!\nShaking in anger, he sent a message to Chun Yeowun.\nA voice full of determination.\n[Lord Chun Ma. It looks like things are going to be tough. Since you’re Chun Ma, you will be able to get out of this place. So please rescue my pitiful mother!]\nThere were no nano bombs in Chun Yeowun’s body.\nWhich was why Chun Yeowun would be able to escape.\n[Forgive me for the rudeness I have shown.]\nWhen that was done, Baek Jong-so shouted.\n“Keep your promise.”\nAt that, Neung Do-myung smiled.\n“I promise. I will risk my honor for your life. Go on and destroy him.”\nAt that, the team leader Go put his finger on the terminal and shouted at Chun Yeowun.\n“Move even a little, and you’ll explode. If you don’t want to die, don’t even try to move a hair!”\nBaek Jong-so slowly approached Chun Yeowun.\nAnd energy concentrated on his hand.\n‘Now!’\nShrek!\nA small dagger came out of the sleeve of Baek Jong-so.\nAt that moment, he quickly turned and threw it at Neung Do-myung.\n‘You need to be killed!’\nThe dagger loaded with energy reached the head of Neung Do-myung at a tremendous speed.\nIt was then.\nVisor!\nBefore it pierced his head, someone struck away the dagger.\nIt was a surprise attack, yet the curly-haired man next to Neung Do-myung was able to block it.\n“How dare you!”\nTeam leader Go flinched at the sudden attack and tried to press the button.\n‘Ahh...’\nBaek Jong-so, who failed, closed his eyes.\nHis whole body was gripped in fear as he knows how the nano bomb explodes.\nPath!\nThen, someone took the terminal.\nThe curly-haired man.\nTeam leader Go was trying to protest, but the man handed the terminal to Neung Do-myung and said,\n“We aren’t in a hurry, superintendent. Give him to me.”\nChak!\nThe person he pointed to was Chun Yeowun.\nNeunh Do-myung was speechless as he was still in shock because of the dagger which came for him suddenly.\n“It has been a while since I’ve had a serious battle with a warrior in Shenyang. After all, we have the detonation code. Why hurry?”\nThe eyes of the curly-haired man were filled with joy.\nHe was a man who was eager to fight from the beginning.\n‘... this man isn’t under my control.’\nNeung Do-myung nodded his head.\n“Huh!”\nSrrrng!\nWhen permission was granted, the curly-haired man pulled out his sword.\nIt was made of some alloy rather than iron.\nWoong!\nWhen the man released his energy, a blue sword qi formed across the sword.\nJust looking at it was enough to know the man was a Superior Master.\nGoo!\n“Woah!”\n“What energy!”\nExclamation flowed out of the mobile strikers’ mouths.\nThey, too, learned martial arts, but they were still shocked at the sight, which was rare to witness in Shenyang.\nThe man approached Chun Yeowun and said.\n“I heard that you are a Superior Master too. Huhuhu. To meet a criminal with the same level of skills as me in Shenyang, I’m so lucky, right?”\nHis voice seemed elated.\nThe energy felt from Chun Yeowun’s body was of the Super Master Level.\nAs his internal energy couldn’t be sensed, he thought he should be equal to or a little higher than the Super Master Level.\n“Don’t be wary of the detonator or machine guns. No one will disturb us while we play.”\nShhh!\nAfter a certain distance was obtained, the curly-haired man took a stance.\nHe had no intention of underestimating his opponent.\nHe just wanted to enjoy the fight.\n“You seem nervous, so let me make the first move.”\nPhat!\nIn an instant, he moved in front of Chun Yeowun.\nWith a splendid trajectory, the blue sword qi tried to cut Chun Yeowun.\nIt was then.\n“Play with yourself.”\nGrab!\n“Hmp!”\nBefore the sword could touch him, Chun Yeowun grabbed the curly-haired man’s face.\n‘Wh-What strength!’\nBewildered, the man readjusted and tried to cut Chun Yeowun hand.\nClench!\nHis head shattered and splattered like a watermelon.\nUnable to scream, the man whose head was shattered staggered and fell down like a broken doll.\nThud!\n‘!!!’\nThe inside of the abandoned factory was stained with silence at what happened.\nThe Superior Master, their trump card, met a tragic death in the blink of an eye.\nIt was shocking.\n“Such a talker.”\nShake!\nChun Yeowun shook and wiped the blood off his hands.\n“Eik!”\nTeam leader Go immediately shouted at Neung Do-myung.\n“Su-Superintendent! Press it! Quickly!”\nNeung Do-myung, who was shocked, came back to reality.\nIf this was the level of a monster who could take down a superior master in a second, then machine guns wouldn’t work on him.\nThere was no time to think about anything else.\nTak!\nBiting his lip, he shook his head and placed his finger on the button.\n‘Ahhh.’\nBaek Jong-so closed his eyes in despair.\nNo matter how hard he tried, his end was coming.\n“Damn it! Press it before he moves!”\nThe team leader screamed in fear.\nIn the end, the button was pressed.\nIt was then.\nBang! Bang! Bang! Bang!\nSmall explosions were heard everywhere.\nSome were heard near team leader Go and Neung Do-myung.\nBaek Jong-so’s eyes fluttered.\n‘Wh-What is this?’\nBaek Jong-so was the one who was supposed to be killed, but he was standing there intact with a puzzled expression.\nHe couldn’t understand.\nDrip!\nTeam leader Go’s head was bleeding, blood was dripping down from his eyes, nose, mouth and ears.\nA faint trail of smoke was rising from it too.\n“T-Team leader Go!”\nThud!\nThe body fell to the floor and trembled.\nIt wasn’t just him.\nThud! Thud! Thud!\nMobile strikers on the first and second floors collapsed at random.\nA total of twelve people fell.\n“Ah-hyeon!”\n“Yuk-cheong!”\nThe mobile strikers standing next to them grabbed them.\nThe men who monitored their conditions mumbled.\n“Shit!”\n“H-He is dead...”\nThey were not breathing.\nBaek Jong-so turned his head and looked at Chun Yeowun.\nBaek Jong-so was the one who was supposed to die.\n“Wh-What is this...”\nBefore he could even finish, Neung Do-myung looked at both of them and shouted.\n“What the hell did you do?!”\nChun Yeowun answered him as if it wasn’t a big deal.\n“Good things should be shared. Isn’t that right?”",

      "content": "Around two hours ago.\n‘Nano. You succeeded.’\nAt the fingertips of Chun Yeowun, Baek Jong-so was lying in the large room on his back because his blood points were sealed.\nAlthough it couldn’t be explained, Chun Yeowun succeeded in collecting the nano bombs inside Baek Jong-so’s body.\n[If it is absorbed into the user’s body, disarming the nano bombs with the nano machines is possible.]\n‘Absorb and disarm?’\n[Since it is a nano device with just one simple frequency and code, it can be done.]\n‘... then could we take the nano bombs and use them?’\n[It is possible.]\n‘Oh-ho, really?’\nThe nano bombs from Baek Jong-so’s body fell short compared to the future.\nWhich made it easy for Nano to control them.\nThe team leader and the mobile strikers, who had fallen to the ground, were killed by the nano bombs Chun Yeowun injected into them.\nDespite it looking like torture, this was the reason why Chun Yeowun put his finger into their flesh.\n‘I didn’t use them all.’\nTheir bodies didn’t need to turn into dust.\nBy sending an appropriate amount of nano bombs to the heart or brain, it was possible to effectively kill the enemy.\nTheir deaths were the result of that.\n‘Th-This can’t be!’\nIt was hard to believe for Neung Do-myung, who wasn’t aware of such nano technology.\nEven the technical support team of the Public Security Bureau, who studied the nano bombs from Baek Jong-so’s body for nearly a month, were unable to find anything remotely important.\nIn that way, the MS technology was at the pinnacle of current technology.\n‘Team leader Go...’\nNeung Do-myung looked at the deceased team leader.\nIf the man’s words were true, then team leader Go had dug his grave with his own hands.\n“Let’s continue what we were doing.”\nTak!\nChun Yeowun took a step forward.\nIt was one simple step, but it was strong enough to overpower Neung Do-myung, who was gripped by fear.\nSurprised, Neung Do-myung stepped back and shouted.\n“Don-Don’t move! Can’t you see the machine guns aiming at you?”\nClank!\nThe mobile strikers all aimed for Chun Yeowun at that cry.\nThe red laser points from the guns aimed at Chun Yeowun’s head and heart.\nTwelve people died, but there were fifty more alive.\n“Tch!”\nBaek Jong-so grunted as he looked at the machine guns aiming for them.\nEven he, who is at the end of the Super Master Level, can only avoid bullets when he watched which direction the bullets are coming from.\nBut this, this is too many.\n‘Damn it! One problem after another!’\nA typical gun can fire bullets at a speed of 300 to 500 m/s, but machine guns can fire at 1000 m/s.\nSuch speed is too high to handle.\nAnd the destructive power is evident.\nIt would be difficult to avoid or block such machine gun fire, no matter how strong a warrior was, especially when 50 people were surrounding them.\n‘Even if he is Chun Ma this...’\nHe wasn’t confident anymore.\nThe present era was an era where Murim warriors used firearms.\nUnlike Chun Yeowun, who was still calm, Baek Jong-so was nervous and tense as he kept trying to calm his heart.\n‘Right. I shouldn’t let myself get swayed.’ (1)\nThe mobile strikers still had an advantage.\nWith the number of guns they were aiming and they only had two opponents.\nPlus, Neung Do-myung also learned martial arts.\n‘He’s keeping a poker face, but that’s just a bluff. As long as he hasn’t lost his reasoning after seeing this, he’ll back down, how can one person handle this many machine guns?’\nNeung Do-myung thought it would be difficult to avoid a shower of bullets, even if the opponent was a Superior Master.\nWith that certainty, he calmed down.\nHowever,\nTak!\nChun Yeowun once again took a step towards Neung Do-myung.\n‘Has he gone insane?’\nFifty machine guns were aiming at him, yet he showed no sign of fear.\n“Do-Do you want to die? Stop! Stop now!”\nStep! Step!\n“You!”\nHe kept walking while ignoring his words, making Neung Do-myung confused.\nAnd then he raised his hand and pointed towards Chun Yeowun.\nThat was the signal, all the mobile strikers tried to pull their triggers.\n“It-It’s dangerous!”\nBaek Jong-so hurriedly jumped in front of Chun Yeowun.\nIn that fleeting moment,\n“You are one annoying man.”\nChun Yeowun raised his palm and then slightly turned it.\nAnd,\nThud! Thud! Thud! Thud!\n“Kuak!”\n“Kuk!”\n“Euk!”\nBefore the triggers were pulled, the mobile strikers who were aiming their guns fell to the ground in unison.\nThey all fell over.\nAround 50 people, no exceptions.\n“M-My body...”\n“Shit!”\nThey couldn’t hide their shock.\nAn unknown energy forced their bodies down.\n“What are you all doing! Shoot!”\nNeung Do-myung shouted, but not a single person pulled the trigger.\nThey were all on the floor with the feeling of something crushing them, how could they shoot in such a circumstance?\nCreep!\nFor a second, Neung Do-myung felt goosebumps rise all over his body.\nHe didn’t realize it, but the flow of energy around him was as if he was in the eye of the storm.\nIt was a level he could never fathom.\n“Wh-What kind of human can even have such ene...”\nHe never experienced it.\nThe internal energy he was feeling was so overpowering that his own energy felt like a grain of salt compared to it.\n“Eikkk!”\nAt that time, a few mobile strikers on the second floor tried to pull the triggers despite being pushed to the ground, enduring the pain of being crushed.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun lowered his hand even further.\nCrack!\nWith a cracking sound, the mobile strikers had fallen.\nThe sound of bones cracking could be heard loud and clear as they were in an abandoned factory.\nCrack! Crack!\n“Kuak!”\n“Ackk!”\nScreams rang out.\nBut they didn’t last long.\nBefore long, only three people were standing inside the abandoned factory.\nThud!\nAnd one of them, Neung Do-myung, fell on his butt.\nHe wanted to step back and run away, but he was too terrified to even move a single step.\n“Hic!”\nWith fear in his eyes, he looked at Chun Yeowun.\nUsing the tracking device, they had set a trap.\n‘Ho-How did this happen...’\nThe detonator of the nano bomb, and the agents of the Public Security.\nHe even brought in Special Inspector Jun Ye-myeong, one of the top seven warriors of the Public Security just in case there was an emergency.\nBut he was killed so easily.\n“M-Monster!”\nBaek Jong-so agreed with that.\nHe knew that Chun Yeowun was strong because of what he saw inside the Six Road Toys’ building, but he still didn’t expect this level of resourcefulness and skill.\n‘Amazing!’\nWhat overwhelming ability to overturn the situation.\nNow that the situation was settled, there was only one thing to do.\nPhat!\nBaek Jong-so ran over to Neung Do-myung who was on the ground, and kicked him in the stomach.\nPuck!\n“Kuak!”\nDo-myung, who was hit in the abdomen with a kick loaded with energy, coughed up blood.\nGrabbing his collar, Baek Jong-so shouted.\n“My mother! Where is my mother?”\nPuck!\nBaek Jong-so’s fist struck the man’s cheek.\nAnd it was only the beginning.\n“Where is she, you bastard!”\nPuck! Puck!\n“Kuak!”\nThe anger he was holding back wasn’t something he could control anymore.\nBaek Jong-so hit him until his face went limp.\nAlthough not all of the hits were imbued with energy, as he kept getting hit, Neung Do-myung’s face was swollen.\n“Huh... huh... huh....”\n“Say it. Where is my mother! If you don’t want to die, answer me!”\nBaek Jong-so grabbed him and shook him.\nHowever, the answer which came from Neung Do-myung was different.\n“Huh... huh... how... what is... your identity? A guy like you is an unregistered Murim warrior?”\nHis swollen eyes were looking at Chun Yeowun.\nHe had lost, but he at least wanted his doubts to be resolved.\nChun Yeowun approached him.\n“What good would knowing that do when you are in this state?”\n“Huh?”\n“Move.”\n“Y-Yes!”\nAs Baek Jong-so moved, Chun Yeowun shoved his finger into Neung Do-myung’s shoulder.\nPuck!\n“Kuaak!”\nAnd he pulled out his finger.\n“I put nano bombs in your body.”\n“W-What?”\nHe couldn’t understand.\nHe just poked into the flesh with his finger, but what was this about nano bombs being injected?\n“What nonsense...”\nSnap!\nChun Yeowun snapped his fingers.\nPang!\nA small bang was heard.\nIntense pain began to come from the bottom of his left hand.\n“Kuaaak!”\nShocked, Neung Do-myung looked at his palm.\nThe middle of his palm was tanned, as if it was burning inside.\n“What is this?”\n“Your body holds 1000 nano bombs. They’re distributed evenly throughout your body through your blood vessels. 500 are in your brain.”\n“What?”\nHis eyes trembled.\nHe couldn’t dismiss it as a lie as the pain in his palm was proof of it.\n“How can th...”\n“You don’t need to know that. There’s only one thing you need to do, answer us.”\nTak! Pang!\nWhen Chun Yeowun snapped his fingers again, the pain hit his right hand.\n“Achhhh!”\nThe pain of something exploding inside his body.\nAs his body convulsed, he cursed Chun Yeowun.\n“Shiiiitttttt! You. You... you fucking bastard!”\nChun Yeowun ignored that and spoke.\n“From now on, we will detonate one bomb after the other.”\n‘!?’\nThe swollen eyes of Neung Do-myung went wide.\nChun Yeowun had said that there were a total of 1000 nano bombs in his body.\nAnd he detonated 2 so far, which meant 998 are left.\n‘Sigh...’\nEven Baek Jong-so, who hated him for taking away his mother, frowned.\nIf it was him, he would rather commit suicide than suffer in such a slow manner.\n“You... you are vicious....”\n“I won’t ask anything. I’ll just explode one every five seconds.”\n“Wh-Ahat!?”\n“Let’s see how tightly sealed those lips are.”\nWith that, Chun Yeowun spread out his hand, and folded one finger after another.\nEvery time another finger folded, the expression on Do-myung’s face was nothing short of a spectacle.\nAs the last of the five was about to fold, he shouted.\n“Wait! Wait! Hold up. I... I don’t know! I really don’t know as it was decided by the higher...”\nSnap! Pang!\nA nano bomb in his right foot exploded.\n“Ackkkkkk! Fuck! Fuck!”\nHow painful it must have been.\nStill he calmed himself.\n“Kuak... really... don’t... know...”\nChun Yeowun didn’t care, and started folding his fingers again.\nSeeing that, Neung Do-myung began to break out in cold sweat.\nHe was at a loss for words because of Chun Yeowun’s expression as he folded his fingers without even blinking an eye.\n‘You... this man will really do it.’\nHe was trained to handle torture.\nHowever, it was the first time he was being psychologically pressured.\nThis wasn’t a horrible pain, rather, it was a slow way of driving him to the edge of sanity.\n‘He is not evil, he is the devil himself!’\nNow, one finger was left again.\nAt that moment, Neung Do-myung shouted.\n“I-I will speak! Please... please... stop!”\nA declaration of surrender came out of his mouth.\nBaek Jong-so, who was watching it anxiously, smiled.\n“Say it! Where is my mother?”\n“Before that, guarantee one thing!”\nNeung Do-myung wasn’t going to believe Chun Yeowun.\nAfter he answered, he was sure that Chun Yeowun would kill him.\n“... are you haggling with me?”\nIn shock, Neung Do-myung shouted.\n“Wait! Wait! It’s a place... you can’t go without... me!”\n“What do you mean?”\nAs he answered the question from Chun Yeowun he spoke cautiously.\n“I’m not cheating you. It’s not a place you can go just because you know where it is. You need to make a request to the Defense Department...”\nFlinch!\nAt that moment Chun Yeowun frowned and stood up.\nHe looked northwest.\n‘What... this wave?’\nA tremendous energy, strong enough to shock Chun Yeowun was spreading out.\nIt felt like it was shaking the space.\nIt was then.\nWheiiing! Wheiiing!\nSounds from outside the factory.\nIt wasn’t just a sound near the factory, it was a siren all throughout Shenyang.\nWith a shocked expression, Neung Do-myung said.\n“No way... at a time like this? The Defense Department said that it would take three days...”\nHe wasn’t the only one shocked.\nBaek Jong-so, spoke with trembling eyes.\n“Gate-Gate Warning!”\n(1) - The POV switches to Neung Do-myung",

      "content": "Gate Defense Department on the site of Shenyang City Hall.\nThe sun had set and it was getting dark, but the lights on all the floors of the defense department were on.\nGate Defense works on a 24 hours system, day and night, with a shift always working to prepare for when and where a situation might arise.\nSince the safety of the citizens was at stake, the atmosphere was always tense.\nAs such, defending against the Gate was a great mission.\n“East B-1 barrier.”\n“East B-2 barrier.”\nReports were coming in every 30 minutes from the monitoring room.\nAgents seated in front of more than 300 monitors reported the presence and absence of abnormalities, which was very important for security.\nIt could be said that it was manually performed by not just the department in Shenyang, but all the defense departments around the world.\n“East F-1 barrier.”\n“Hm.”\nAt the report which followed, a middle-aged woman with short hair in a grey military uniform standing in the center of the room nodded.\nHer name was Wei So-yong.\nShe’s the lieutenant of the Defense department and in charge of tonight.\nWei So-yong, who was receiving the report, looked at the D-Day displayed on the large monitor.\n‘We have three days, no four days left? Sigh.’\nShe sighed.\nAlthough she was a soldier, she wasn’t a military person by nature.\nWhat she was concerned about was that the Gate would open on the 4th day.\n‘Please don’t let that happen when I’m on duty.’\nThe Gate had opened twice while she was in command of the watch.\nThe first time, she was fortunate enough to prevent it, and the second time the southwest wall was pierced and the factory site was devastated.\n400 casualties.\nThat was Wei So-yong’s worst memory.\n‘The factories were built on such a site...’\nOriginally, it was illegal to build anything let alone a factory within 3 km of the wall, but permission was granted only through the connections of the son-in-law of the mayor of Shenyang at that time.\nThanks to that incident, the mayor was taken down.\n‘I was lucky then but...’\nIf the barrier was broken this time, she wouldn’t be able to make any excuses.\nAs a traumatized woman, she longed for the Gate to not open when she was on duty.\n“Southern G-25 barrier.”\n“Good. Keep working hard. I’ll be back in 30 minutes.”\nShe turned her back ready to head to her office after getting the last report.\nBeep! Beep! Beep! Beep!\nAn alarm sounded from the main detector in the room.\n“Commander!”\nWei So-yong’s expression distorted at the shout of the second lieutenant who was in front of the detector.\nShe wasn’t unaware of the beep.\n‘Gate!’\nWoong!\nThe people in the room began to talk.\nThis was much faster than the notice from the Gate Investigation Team.\nWheeing! Wheeing! Wheeing!\nThe sirens started up automatically 5 seconds after the main detector’s beeping sound.\nGate Warning.\nA siren heard throughout Shenyang city.\nWei So-yong turned around and asked.\n“Lieutenant Jin, where?”\n“The coordinates are... 41°46’48.4\"N 123°01’17.5\"E. this is Gate 26! GE wave activation progressed 38 percent!”\nThe coordinates were on the western side of the city.\n“Shit!”\nGate 26 came faster than expected.\nMoreover, if the Gate Energy wave activation was 38% the gate was almost half open.\nSo, when she took office, she desperately hoped that this wouldn’t happen, but her hopes were shattered.\nBut there was no time for that.\n“Type?”\nTatatat!\nAt her cry, the people inside the monitor room on the western wall speeded up.\nEach of them weren’t just in charge of CCTV cameras inside the wall, but outside the wall too.\nAt that moment, a soldier cried.\n“Lo-Look at this!”\nTatak!\nHe pressed keys and then connected it to the main monitor.\nThe coordinates indicated at the top of the screen were close to the gate.\nDrrr!\nThe camera was shaky.\nIt seemed like it was shaking because of the speed of the wave.\nEveryone looked at it with tense eyes.\nDududud!\nAnd then, the screen switched to night vision mode, and caught something running.\nThe soldier zoomed in on it.\nA strange being which didn’t exist on earth was caught on the screen.\n“An individual type!”\nIt was the size of a hippo and had six horns and long sharp fangs. And then they saw the monster run fast like a cougar.\n‘Individual type.’\nWei So-yong was a little relieved.\nThere were three types of hazards that came out of the gates.\nIndividual type, disaster type, and special type.\nOut of the three types, individual is the easiest, but it’s still dangerous.\nFor example, the one which broke through the last barrier was an individual type.\n“And the risk?”\n“Please wait a moment.”\nTatata!\nThe soldier typed on his keyboard and reached for something.\nShortly after, the search data appeared on a large screen.\n[Hazard level: Horn Jackal: C Class]\nNumber of Gate appearances: 12 times in European Gates and 7 times in Asia Gates.\nBerlin Gate 15, 2049.05.20. 19:23 (First)\nMunich Gate 29, 2051.07.15. 20:02\nChengdu City, Sichuan Province, Gate 43, 2058.02.19. 19:40\n“C-C Class?”\nWoong!\nOnce again the monitoring room was a mess.\nDangerous objects are divided into a total of six classes, E, D, C, B, A, and S. The higher, the riskier.\nThe reason why the soldiers in the monitor room were shocked was simple.\nAlthough all types are hazards, the level of risk increased significantly from C class and on.\n‘C class is...’\nWei So-yong bit her lip.\nIt was the first time since she was promoted to the Shenyang city defense department that this class had come up.\nThe last gate was a class D and dangerous, and anything higher could mean that it was a crisis.\nOne of the soldiers in the room was perplexed.\n“The National Guards are moving towards the Western Wall. I will send them the type information.”\nAt that, she nodded her head.\nThe situation had just come up, but the situation was clear.\nShe was the one who would be held responsible for this.\n“Issue summoning orders to the Gate Keepers belonging to Shenyang city, and send a request to defend against the gate to the Murim Association.”\n“Roger!”\nAt the same time.\nThere were buses running west across downtown Shenyang.\nOn both sides of the bus was written ‘Gate Keepers’ of the Shenyang defense department, which literally meant that the bus was carrying Gate Keepers.\nThe buses had left three minutes after the warning was issued.\nIt took much longer for the defense department to issue the summons than it did for them to leave.\nInside the first bus.\nA young man in his early 30s with mostly white hair and a little bit of hair dyed yellow was in the front seat. He chewed gum as he shook his head at the text which appeared on the screen of his phone.\n[Gate Keepers should immediately divide into three teams at D-8, D-13 and E-3 barriers to the west and assemble.\nHazard level: Horn Jackal: C class]\n“Slow. Slow. They should have sent it right away as soon as the alarm went off.”\n“Why don’t you stop messing around and put on the hazmat suit?”\nA middle-aged man with a beard scolded him for messing around and not putting the protective suit on.\n“Ehhh. Captain. You know that I don’t need that. I don’t fancy it either.”\n“Yang Tae-pyung! Are you going to get your senses back only after you get infected with the toxic substance outside the wall?”\nYang Tae-pyung, the man with white and yellow hair, grumbled as he narrowed his eyes, but he got up and opened the luggage compartment.\n“I’m a B class Keeper and when did you ever see me get infected...”\n“Are you going to keep complaining?”\n“Yes. Yes.”\nThe reason Tae-pyung, who is proud and selfish, showed such a weak appearance was because the bearded man was the Captain of the Gate Keepers.\nDo Jung-rak.\nAge 42.\nAnd he’s the only A class Keeper in Shenyang city with special abilities.\nHis special ability was turning his skin into steel, and he possessed enough strength to lift and throw a bus.\nDo Jung-rak asked while touching his ear piece.\n“Did you all get the message from the National Defense Department?”\nAt that question, the voices of two of the three platoon leaders, two males and one female, who were B class Keepers and on buses 1, 2, and 3 were heard.\n-Click! Yes!\n-We received it.\n“Bus 1 will go to D-13, Bus 2 will head to D-8, To And and Bus 3 will go to E-3 wall.”\n-Yes. We understand, leader.\nThere was no answer from the B class Keeper Go Yoon, the platoon leader of Bus 3.\nDo Jung-rak was puzzled and about to ask, when he heard the voice.\n-Captain Do... I’m in need of money urgently, can’t we go to D-13?\n“Ah...”\nWhen one looks at the coordinates where the Gate is open, D-13 is a straight line.\nAnd there was a high probability of encountering an alpha-type entity with a Gate Core.\nThe main task of the Gate Keepers was to handle the cores of Alpha types and keep the gate closed while the National Guards intercept the normal hazard level beings.\n“Looks like you need an allowance. Our Yooni-hyung. Hehe.”\nTae-pyung, who was in the same platoon heard it and scoffed at him.\nGate Keepers were paid some of the highest salaries.\nBut like any job, the salary wasn’t the same for all the Gate Keepers.\nIt varied a lot depending on the class.\nBecause of that, Gate Keepers try to increase their pay by working hard on developing their abilities and increasing their class when the gates aren’t open.\nHowever, there was another special type of pay.\n“Actually, if it’s the core of a C class alpha hazard entity, the bonus will be 4 to 5 billion won, and it’s worth it.” (3.4 to 4.2 Million United States Dollars)\nIt was an unimaginable amount.\nConsidering that the annual salary of a B class Keeper is around 1 billion won, the extra pay was amazing.\nAnd that was why the Keepers risked their lives in dealing with the Alpha type entities.\n“Yoonie hyung. What are we supposed to do? There’s something that I was wanting this ti...”\nKang!\n“Euk!”\nTae-pyung clasped his head and screamed.\nThere was a reason for it, he was hit by Do Jung-rak’s fist made of steel.\nIgnoring Tae-pyung, he put his finger on his ear piece and said.\n“I get it. We will go to the E-3 barrier.”\n-Click... Thank you! Captain!\nAt those words, Go Yoon’s voice brightened.\nThen, Do Jung-rak said,\n“Instead, you shouldn’t lose the core to the Murim Association. Got it?”\n-Click! Definitely!\nDo Jun-rak grinned and spoke to the driver.\n“Ha. Move to the southwest E-3 barrier.”\nMeanwhile, a nearby road in the northwest of Shenyang.\nA white sedan was quickly heading towards the Murim Association office.\nIn the backseat of the car, two men with colorful blades set aside were talking.\nThe person on the right was Moyong Yi-sun, the executive director of the Yeon Company.\nAnd in the left seat was a man in his 60s, with dark eyebrows and half white half black hair, the chairman of the Yeon Company, Moyong Geum.\nTok!\nTo check if there was a message, Moyong Yi-sun raised his hand and touched his phone.\nMoyong Geum asked.\n“Are you saying that all the people of the association have gathered?”\n“Looks like most of them have arrived. We just need to get there.”\nCurrently in a branch of the Murim Association, most of the branch’s registered Murim warriors had gathered.\nThey were waiting for the head of the Shenyang Murim Association Branch, Moyong Geum.\n“Is that old man also there?”\n“He refused the housing we provided but he has been with the Murim Association all along.”\n“Huh.”\nThe one Moyong Geum was asking about was Peng Neung-gyeom.\nPeng Neung-gyeom, a man in his 70s with a higher share in Murim, had come to meet him, but Moyong Geum didn’t let him.\nAs he couldn’t just turn a blind eye, he tried to send Moyong Yi-sun and provide accommodations, but he refused that and went over to the Murim Association.\n“Everyone is old yet their greed doesn’t subside. That place will be heavily guarded. You’ll go around that place and covet the core.”\n“There’s no way we can stop others.”\nThere were people who had come in the name of helping those working near the Gates out.\nEven if Shenyang was run by their huge company, they wouldn’t drive out people who came on their own two feet to help.\nMoyong Yi-sun sighed and said,\n“More than that, the Gate opened at such a time.”\n“Don’t be in a hurry. You are the person who will be the next head of the Yeon company.”\n“...”\n“It’s never too late to solve the problem of the Six Road Toys and their inner workings.”\n“But I sent pursuers...”\n“Huh. I keep telling you to not rush.”\nMoyong geum’s voice sounded irritated, so Moyong Yi-sun kept his mouth shut.\nSo far in his life, he hasn’t been able to overcome the strong hold his father had on him.\n“First, focus on the core. If it’s a C class core, you can enhance the aggression to get it one step further. Of course, you can do it.”\nCores.\nCrystals of pure energy.\nThe governments of each country use them as an alternative energy, but the Murim Association has the technology to enhance internal energy by refining cores.\nThat was the reason why Murim warriors and the Murim Association came over to perform during the Gate Warning.\nHolding his sword, Moyong Geum said.\n/strong>\n“This time will be more difficult than the last time. Not just the Gate Keepers, but that old man is also aiming for the core.”\n“Don’t worry. I will get the core.”\nGetting a core was a huge deal.\nThis time, the Yeon Company was aiming to close the gate, and just doing that will gain them a huge name.\n“Yes. Still, don’t overdo it. If it’s a C class Alpha hazard, it might be difficult for your current level.”\n“Understood.”\nThe two wealthy people, the descendants of the Moyong clan, were determined.\nAn abandoned factory in the southwest.\n“Ahh! What kind of bullshit is that!”\nPuck!\n“Kuak!”\nAt Baek Jong-so’s kick, Neung Do-myung collapsed.\nBaek Jong-so was unable to overcome his anger, as he grabbed the man by his collar and shouted.\n“What did you say? The place is outside the wall?”\n“Ugh...”\nThat was the reason he was angry.\nAfter the Gate Warning was issued, he asked with a desperate attitude.\nBut what the man said was absurd.\n“You crazy bastard! How could you do that!”\n“Th-That’s why I told you! You can’t do it without me...”\n“Are you really spewing that nonsense!”\nPuak!\n“Kuak!”\nBaek Jong-so kicked him again.\nIn the midst of the pain, Neung Do-myung was flustered in his own way.\n‘Damn it. I gave up.’\nThe fact that he revealed this information could be a fatal blow to the Public Security Bureau.\nGenerally speaking, safe houses are places used by public bureaus or intelligence agencies to maintain confidentiality.\nA place where one can be hidden.\nBefore the Gate, the deep valley or the sparsely populated place would normally be used.\nHowever, after the Gate was created, the Public Security thought the other way around.\nThe most dangerous place to keep the people who needed to be kept secret was outside the wall.\n‘Damn it! It was so people won’t be able to find out.’\nEntry and exit from the wall was normally controlled.\nIt was because there could be unknown dangerous objects, or toxic substances.\n“... how could you do that...”\nBaek Jong-so’s eyes were red.\nEveryone in the current age knew just how dangerous outside the wall was.\nWhen he found out that his mother was being kept outside, he couldn’t help but cry out in anger.\nTo be honest, he wanted to kill the man right away.\n‘Haa... haaa... no. I need to save my mother.’\nThe Gate Warning was issued.\nHe didn’t know what would happen if he didn’t save his mother in this situation.\nBaek Jong-so grabbed the man and asked.\n“Where? Where the hell did you place my mother?”\n“Th-That...”\n“Spill it. If you don’t want to die by my hands.”\n“1 km to the west...”\nBeep!\nAt that time, an emergency message from the National Defense Department appeared on Baek Jong-so’s phone.\n[Gate Warning 26\nCitizens residing within 30 km of the western wall should evacuate to a nearby designated shelter.]\n‘!!!’\nAs he was still holding the man by his collar, even Neung Do-myung went stiff at the message.\nHe didn’t dream that this would happen.\nBewildered, Neung Do-myung said.\n“Ah, the house is made of alloy more than 1 meter thick and our men are...”\n“Shut the fuck up. Are you really saying...”\n“Enough. Stop it.”\nChun Yeowun cut off their yelling.\nAs he lost his reasoning, Baek Jong-so shouted at Chun Yeowun with red eyes.\n“But, but my mother...”\n“Do you think you can save your mother by killing him?”\n“I know that. But the Gate Warning has been issued. And the dangerous ones will flock to the outside of the wall. What can we even do now?”\n“What do you mean by what can we even do?”\n“Huh?”\n“Do you think I’ll let a member of my cult die?”\n‘!?’\nBaek Jong-so trembled at Chun Yeowun’s words.\nLeaving behind his shocked face, he spoke to Neung Do-myung.\n“The location. Tell me the coordinates.”",

      "content": "Wheeing! Wheeeing! Wheeing!\nImmediately after the Gate alarm was sounded,\nThe city of Shenyang had begun the preparation for defense.\nThick iron sheets descended over the doors and windows of all the buildings, and the citizens were quick to move into the assigned shelters under the guidance of Defense Department soldiers.\n“Slowly! Children and elderly enter first.”\nAround 28 years have passed since the Gates first opened.\nBecause of the periodic opening of Gates, people were accustomed to it.\nThere was no confusion and panic.\nClang! Clang!\nEveryone calmly moved to the underground shelters, and when they were done, the doors of the bunkers in Shenyang closed one after the other.\nMore than 70% of the defense force in Shenyang City was dispatched to the western wall.\nAnd the remaining 30% of the defense force was left to protect the other walls.\nThe moment the western wall breaks, everything ends.\nThis was a war to protect everyone from the dangerous entities which threatened humanity.\nDrrrr!\nThe sound of about 30 tanks moving could be heard.\nZRV-30 and ZRV-35, the 4th generation tanks of years 30-35, arrived in front of the D-13 section of the western wall, in a straight line near the Gate.\nWheeing! Thud!\nFrom the ZRV-30’s side, mechanical fasteners came down and crashed into the ground.\nThe angle of the tank’s barrel, which was fixed pointing 500m (1640 ft) in front of the barrier in the first row, went up and was ready to fire shells at the enemy.\nWith a caliber of 130mm and a barrel length of 7m, the ZRV-30 is a tank with a firing range of more than 8km.\nWheeing!\nTen ZRV-35s suddenly formed mechanical legs.\nThe ZRV-35 was a mobile operation tank that was not intended for long-range artillery.\nClank! Clank!\nTheir mechanical legs climbed up the walls of the barrier.\nThe ZRV-35s, which climbed up the barrier, were firmly fixed to it and aimed their barrels.\n-All tanks ready.\n-Alright. Wait for the commander’s signal.\n-Roger!\n-Artillery units need to stand in their assigned places.\n-Roger\nThousands of soldiers stood in front of various weapons on each wall, with medium-range guns looking into the dark horizon.\n“Phew.... Phew....”\n“Fuck. I’m trembling.”\nThe most nervous ones were the infantrymen who were encamped in front of the outer wall.\nEven the sergeants with a lot of combat experience were trembling.\nA melee battle starts when the dangerous entities come out of the Gate.\n‘Aren’t they trembling?’\n‘Be quiet. Jerk.’\nSome people looked relaxed compared to the infantrymen.\nThey were the Gate Keepers and the Murim Association who were camped right behind the infantry with their swords and their special abilities.\nTheir true value shows itself the moment they get close to the entities.\nOrdinary infantrymen were vulnerable and would die if they got too close to the dangerous entities.\n[Father. I don’t see Do Jung-rak?]\nMoyong Geum, who was wiping his sword next to Moyong Yi-sun, looked at the Gate Keepers as he heard from his son.\nThe figure of Do Jung-rak, the leader of the Gate Keepers of Shenyang, who would normally be at the forefront, wasn’t visible.\n[That’s good.]\nThe relationship between the Murim and the Gate Keepers was quite competitive.\nThe moment they moved to hand-to-hand combat, the struggle for the core would begin.\n[I have a good feeling about this.]\nMoyong Geum was quite excited.\nHe thought that the competition for the core would intensify as Peng Neung-gyeom was here, but without Do Jung-rak, it seemed like a better situation.\n[The fewer the competitors, the better. Yi-sun-ah.]\nWith that, Moyong Geum looked at the president of Six Road Toys, Yeom Ki-seop and then at Peng Neung-gyeom.\nThere were only two people who could get in his way.\nAnd he thought that there was a chance for the Moyong clan to get a C class core.\n‘Hehehehe.’\nPeng Neung-gyeom burst into laughter as he felt the gaze of Moyong Geum on him.\n‘It’s always the same, always.’\nThe real purpose of Peng Neung-gyeom wasn’t the core.\nHowever, it wasn’t like he was here because of the good impression that Moyong Yi-sun left either.\nIt was to get a taste of real combat.\n‘There’s no need to explain.’\nHe wasn’t as driven as Moyong Geum, but he had no intention of giving up the core if he got it.\nThe core was in everyone’s thoughts.\n-Drrrrrr!\nA slight vibration was felt.\n‘!!!’\nEveryone’s eyes turned to the darkness.\nThe commander in charge of the western wall stared at the horizon through a night vision telescope.\nHis eyes looked until he saw something black.\n‘They’re here!’\nSix horns, sharp fangs.\nAnd these dangerous objects were running at a great speed.\nAccording to the information sent from the Defense Department, they had to be Horn Jackals.\n‘They’re fast!’\nThey were really fast.\nThey were the size of hippopotamuses and they ran like cougars running after their prey, and the number, the number of them was too high to count.\nIt was terrifying to see them running towards the wall while filling the entire horizon.\n‘It would be fine to fire from a distance.’\nThey were capable of firing several tens of kilometers.\nHowever, to do that, the tanks had to rise above a certain height, which was impossible.\n‘Nothing can be done.’\nEven at the current maximum range, the entities had to be reduced at all costs.\nMajor Bu Hyeon-dong, the commander of the western wall, raised his hand and shouted.\n“This is the right choice. Tanks, get ready to fire!”\n-Roger!\nAt this command over the radio, the barrels of the tanks on and near the wall moved.\nBu Hyeon-dong lowered his hand and went back to focusing the telescope.\nDrrrr!\nThe vibration on the ground grew louder and more intense.\nSoon the huge flock of Horn Jackals passed through lights.\nThe lieutenant next to him spoke.\n“They have reached the first trigger point!”\n/strong>\nAt that, Bu Hyeon-dong shouted.\n“Fire!”\n-Fire!\nPop! Pop! Pop! Pop!\nAs soon as the command was issued, the guns on the tanks were fired.\nThrough the darkness, the shells covered by a red light fell everywhere throughout the flock of Horn Jackals.\nBang! Bang! Bang! Bang!\nExplosions occurred where the shells fell.\nFlames and smoke rose in the darkness.\n“Keep firing.”\n-Roger!\nPop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!\nThe western area, 7 to 8 km away, was devastated by the shells.\nLooking at that alone, it seemed like the Horn Jackals would be able to pass, but.\nDudududu!\nThe Horn Jackals pierced through the flames.\nThey dodged the shells with their speed, not caring about how many of them were hurt.\n“Damn it! There are too many!\nIn the gap between rounds, they kept crossing in.\nMore than 30% of them were dealt with, and the next chance they had to reduce the number was at a mid-range of 3-4km.\nOtherwise, the infantry ahead might end up getting hurt, and be unable to handle the number.\n“Artillery, get ready to fire!”\n-Roger!\nShortly thereafter, the mid-range guns were fired from the wall.\nThe sound of explosions shook the barrier.\nBang! Bang! Bang!\nThose camped in the front held their machine guns, no one relaxed.\nThe Majors and Sergeants who defended against the Gate several times before knew that.\nIf a shell hits a place not that far from the wall, something will come striking in.\nTak!\nThe guns were held tightly.\nIt was when people were staring intently at the front, which was covered with smoke from the explosions.\nDededede!\n“Ugh!”\n“A-A lot!”\nHorn Jackals came out of the smoke one after another.\nThey weren’t in large numbers, unlike before, but the number still exceeded a thousand.\n“Now! Infantry fire!”\n“Start shooting!”\nEveryone shouted as they commanded the infantry.\nThe infantry, who waited nervously, took their stances at once and opened fire.\nDududud!\nThe sound of machine guns firing filled the place.\nScared and excited, the infantry didn’t rest for even a single second.\n“Die! Dieeee!”\n“You monsters!”\nIt would be nice if they died with just a few shots, but these entities didn’t do that.\nOut of dozens of bullets, they were lucky if the bullets hit the core and the entity died.\n“Slowly, slowly!”\nVisor!\nVisor!\nThe Murim warriors and the Gate Keepers, waiting behind the infantry, pulled out their weapons and prepared themselves.\nDududududu!\n“Ugh!”\n“D-Damn it!”\nThe soldiers’ faces turned white.\nThe Horn Jackals withstood thousands of bullets and reached them.\nAlthough their numbers have been greatly reduced, the hippopotamus-sized oddly shaped beasts were enough to intimidate the infantry.\n“Kwaang!”\n“Eik!”\n“Run!”\nThe Horn Jackals roared as if they were about to attack the infantry.\nAs if waiting, the Murim warriors came out.\nSlash!\n“Move back! We’ll take it from here!”\nA sword-wielding Murim warrior blocked a Horn Jackal and spoke to the infantry.\nChachachacha!\nHis sword tried to cut through the Horn Jackal’s head.\nOf course, people expected it to be cut, but.\n“Kuakk!”\nIt wasn’t cut. Not even a scratch was on it.\nAll that happened was the entity stopped for a moment.\n‘Wh-What? This monster. How does it have this strong of a body?’\nAt that moment, the angry Horn Jackal snorted, then raised his front limbs and slapped away the swordsman.\nHe tried to block it with his sword, but the power of the Horn Jackal was enormous.\nThud!\n“Ackk!”\nThe sword shattered in front of the claws, and the man’s body was torn like a piece of paper.\nHe was a High Ranked Master, but still, he died.\nShocked, someone shouted.\n“Don’t face it head-on! Aim from the back!”\nBut that wasn’t an easy task.\nIt was something that could be done if they were fighting one monster, but.\n“Kuaaaang!”\n“Kwakkk!”\nThe Horn Jackals kept appearing one after another.\nThe Horn Jackals which survived the shellings rushed towards the wall.\n“Shit!”\nKiyun, the platoon leader of the Gate Keepers in charge of D-13, reached out to a jackal.\nThen, a large disc spewed out of his hand with purple sparks.\n“Die!”\nSwoosh!\nThe purple disk flew off at an incredible speed and cut off the paws of the Horn Jackal.\nSlash!\n“Kwaaah!”\n“Not yet!”\n“Not yet!”\nKiyun moved the disc and aimed for its hind legs.\nSlash!\nAs all of its limbs were cut off, the Horn Jackal fell to the ground.\nThud!\nBeing able to freely move the energy disk, he could easily neutralize a single Horn Jackal. It was fitting of a B-class Gate Keeper.\n‘Alpha?’\nAfter subduing the Horn Jackal, Kiyun looked around.\nThe Alpha entity, which is said to be the leader, didn’t appear, and if he found it first the Gate Keepers could attack it.\n“Kwaaaa!”\n“Kuk!”\nAnd another Horn Jackal rushed at him.\nKiyun hurriedly created an energy blaster disc and threw it.\nMeanwhile, Kiyun wasn’t the only one looking for the Alpha.\nSlash! Thud!\n“Huh!”\nOne Horn Jackal was decapitated.\nIt was Moyong Geum, the president of the Yeon Company, who had cut its throat.\nAs an End Stage Superior Master, who were only four in Shenyang city, he killed it in one strike.\n‘Heaven and Earth Breaking Sword!’\nTwo Horn Jackals were cut by the sword at the same time.\nChachachacha!\n“Kuak!”\nThud! Thud!\n“Woah!”\nThe infantry cheered.\n“Amazing!”\n“As expected of a Murim warrior!”\nEight Horn Jackals quickly died by one sword.\nCompared to the other warriors who were struggling, the skilled ones showed incredible strength.\nOf course, he went around killing the Horn Jackals to find the Alpha like Kiyun.\n“Indeed a warrior.”\nThe president of the Six Road Toys, Yeom Ki-seop, clicked his tongue at the sight.\nHe was definitely someone from a prestigious clan.\nAlthough he, too, was a Superior Master, it was clear that Moyong Geum was stronger.\nBut, obviously, that didn’t mean Yeom Ki-seop was weak.\nWoong!\nWhen Yeom Ki-seop unfolded his power, a hole formed through the chest of the Horn Jackal, which flew 5 meters away.\nThe blow itself was great.\n“Indeed!”\nThose who were looking down from the wall were in awe.\nThey were concerned every time the Gate opened, but the Murim warriors and the Gate Keepers were amazing.\nTo fight those monsters like that.\nThe barrier wasn’t breached yet.\nHowever,\n‘Too many. All these are C class.’\nIn the last Gate, there weren’t this many.\nEven though the number had been reduced by the bombardment, the Horn Jackals spanned the length of the wall.\nDespite the bombings, so many were coming towards the wall.\n‘If C class is like this, how dangerous would the ones above this be?’\nThe commander of the western wall bit his tongue. That was when the lieutenant next to him spoke.\n“Major, Major Bu! There! Look over there!”\n“What?”\nBu Hyeon-dong, puzzled, looked at the place the lieutenant was pointing at.\nAbout 1.5 km away, quite a lot of Horn Jackals gathered together. They looked like they were sniffing something.\nHe wondered why until he managed to remember.\n“Lieutenant... isn’t there a safe house in an underground bunker?”\nAs national guards, they knew the location of the safe house.\nThe lieutenant nodded.\n“Yes.”\nIn the past, the location was a housing area, but once the Gate opened, the area was abandoned.\nThe problem, however, was that the Gate opened sooner than predicted.\nWith trembling eyes, Bu Hyeon-dong asked.\n“Don’t tell me, is there someone in the bunker right now?”\nOther than that, there was no other way he could explain the weird behavior of the Horn Jackals.\nSuch an ominous foreboding, but it wasn’t wrong.\nBang! Bang!\nInside the bunker about 1.5km southwest of the western wall.\nThere, the worst had happened, and everyone was holding their breath in fear.\n“Da-Damn it...”\n“They’re going to break the door.”\nFour people were inside.\nThree men were in navy blue uniforms, people of the Public Security Bureau.\nThey couldn’t hide their fear as they saw the bunker’s alloy door caving in.\nBang! Bang!\n“Damn it!”\nThey could hear the sound of something moving outside the closed door.\nIt seemed like it wasn’t going to hold out for much longer, and it wasn’t just the door, the concrete holding it in place was starting to crack.\n“Pr-Protective suits should be put on.”\nOne person said with a trembling voice while looking at the entrance.\nThey, too, heard about the Gate Warning.\nHowever, protective suits weren’t placed inside the safe house to prevent prisoners from using them to escape.\nThe suits would come from the outside when needed.\nAnd such measures turned into trouble for them.\nBang! Grrrr!\nThe entire bunker shook at the hit.\nThe three agents looked at the woman in her mid-fifties, who sat inside the bunker trembling in fear and mumbling something.\n“Damn bitch! Who are we stuck here for! You’re not even praying for us, shit!”\nThe woman was mumbling something.\nShe seemed to be memorizing something as if her life depended on it.\n“I have no regrets in life or death, as this body is to be set on fire. Let the light shine on the way you want to go, and joy and sorrow will turn to dust. Pitiful living beings who are troubled.”\nShe was reciting something from the Sky Demon Order.\nThe woman was Geum Oh-yeon.\nShe was the mother of Baek Jong-so and a member of the Sky Demon Order.\nAs she sensed death coming for her when the Gate alarm was sounded, she began to recite it.\n“I have no regrets in life or death, as this body is to be set on fire. Let the light shine on the way you want to go, and joy and sorrow will turn to dust. Pitiful living beings who are troubled.”\nOne of the agents eventually became impatient and shouted.\n“Damn bitch! I’m dying to panic in here, but you, just stop that chanting and...”\nIt was then.\nKwang! Thud!\nThe alloy door of the bunker opened.\nFrom outside, the sound of wild monsters could be heard.\n“Grrrr!”\nIn the darkness, the red eyes flashed here and there.\nThe Horn Jackals.\n“Eik!”\nShocked, the people tried to move even deeper into the bunker.\nStep!\n“Ack!”\nStep!\nA single Horn Jackal entered the bunker and ate the upper body of one agent.\nDespite the man struggling, not a single person tried to help him.\n“Achhh!”\n“Dieeee!”\nBang! Bang! Bang!\nWhen one of their comrades met a tragic end, the other two, scared for their lives, drew their guns and fired.\nHowever, it was impossible for that monster to die so easily when it wouldn’t even die from machine gun fire.\nClench! Pull!\n“Ugh!”\n“Kuk!”\nThe other two agents were also killed by the monster which waved its claws.\nThe entrance of the bunker was filled with blood.\nTremble!\nGeum Oh-yeon’s face turned pale as she looked at it.\nNo matter how much she chanted it, she couldn’t keep her composure in the face of death.\n‘Ah... this is the end.’\nAt that time, her son popped into her mind.\nThinking of how unhappy he would be to know about her death, her son, who would be alone with no place to turn to, more sadness and fear gripped her.\n‘My son... my poor son...’\n“Grrrr!”\nThe Horn jackal approached the weeping woman.\nIt was the moment when it was about to raise its front claws and strike her, the woman had given up.\n-Grrrr!\n-Rumble!\nThe entire bunker resounded with tremendous vibration.\nThe bunker shook as if an earthquake occurred nearby. The startled monster tried to move.\nSlash!\nSomething cut it, and the Horn Jackal fell.\nGeum Oh-yeon had no idea about what had happened, but she got up when she saw someone walking into the bunker.\nStep!\nA young man in a black coat and black shirt, Chun Yeowun.\n“We weren’t late.”\nGeum Oh-yeon asked with shocked eyes.\n“W-Who?”\n“Are you the mother of Baek Jong-so?”\nAt the name of her son, her eyes fluttered.\nAfter what happened to the Black Sky Company, Baek Jong-so used the name Geum.\nFor him to reveal his true name.\n“Are you from the cult?”\nChun Yeowun, who thought that it was cumbersome to explain, raised his right hand.\nThe black iron guard on his right wrist disassembled and changed into a sword.\nChachachacaha!\nGeum Oh-yeon’s mouth opened at the sight of the black sword which was radiating.\nHer eyes looked at the sword and the words engraved on it.\n“Th... That sword?”\nThat was when Chun Yeowun turned to the entrance and mumbled.\n“... they keep coming.”\nHorn Jackals were flocking towards the bunker.\nThe number had reached a hundred.\n“Huk!”\nGeum Oh-yeon, who looked at that, was scared.\nShe had no idea that so many monsters were outside the bunker.\n“Grrrrrr!”\n“Grrrr!”\nThe smell of human flesh and blood must have brought them there.\nIt was the moment when the monsters were about to attack.\n“Dirty beings showing me their teeth. Tch!”\nChun Yeowun raised his palm towards the sky.\nAt that moment, cold energy rose in the air.\nJjjkkkk!\nHundreds of Ice Swords were created in the air.\nAfter absorbing the cores of the five spirit beasts, Chun Yeowun had reached the Heavenly Master Level and could handle all five elements.\n‘No way!’\nGeum Oh-yeon couldn’t keep her mouth shut at the sight.\nAnd that wasn’t the end.\n“All of you die.”\nChun Yeowun clenched his palm, which was angled towards the sky.\nAt that very moment, the hundreds of Ice Swords were covered in blue light and went for the targets simultaneously.\nChachachacha!\nBlue rays of light cut through the dark night and struck the ground like lightning.\nKwakwakwang!\nHundreds of Horn Jackals, which were surrounding the bunker, helplessly fell down when they were hit by the Air Ice Swords, which had condensed sword qi covering them.\n“Kyyaaaa!”\n“Kwaaaaa!”\n“Ughhhhh!”\nThe screams of the monsters resounded all around.\n“H-How can this be...”\nGeum Oh-yeon couldn’t take her eyes off the Air Swords, which fell down.\nThe name of the technique which astonished her was Sky Flash.\nIt was the absolute technique that was made by the Demon God, Chun Yeowun.\n“Ahhh... Lord Chun Ma!”\nGeum Oh-yeon couldn’t control her tears as she fell to her knees in front of Chun Yeowun.",

      "content": "Kwakwakwang!\nThe Air Swords fell down like rain, unparalleled in power.\nHundreds of Horn Jackals, which came near the bunker because of the smell of human flesh and blood, were killed.\n“Kakakang!”\n“Kwaanh!”\nRunning away was of no use.\nThe scariest thing about the Sky Flash is how precisely it targets the enemies.\nBeep! Beep! Beep!\nThe enemies’ coordinates were displayed in Chun Yeowun’s eyes which opened augmented reality, and the Horn Jackals were marked by red crosses.\nThe hundreds of Air Swords were able to be controlled because of the computational power of Nano.\nA combination of martial arts and technology.\n“... what the hell is that?”\nBu Hyeon-dong, who was looking at the bunker, was shocked.\nHe couldn’t send reinforcements because defending the wall was more important, which was why he was keeping an eye on the bunker with a sad face.\nAnd then, something unknown happened.\nHe hoped to see something, but everything was happening too fast. However, not long after, his hope was answered.\n“Wh-What kind of laser bombing is that?”\nThe light was so bright that he couldn’t see what was happening through the telescope, it seemed like a laser.\nIt wasn’t known for sure, but he was confident about one thing.\nThe Horn Jackals around the bunker were almost wiped out.\nDudududu!\n‘They’re avoiding that place.’\nThe Horn Jackals, which sensed the crisis, moved away from the bunker and towards the wall.\nHe couldn’t understand what happened.\nWoong!\n‘What’s that?’\n‘A newly developed weapon?’\nIt wasn’t just one or two people who saw that.\nMore than half of the soldiers who were holding the mid-range artillery on the wall witnessed it.\nChik!\n“Huh... uh?”\nThe lieutenant, who was looking at that, frowned.\nHe touched the earphone in his left ear and asked.\n“What’s that supposed to mean?... What!”\nShocked, the man hurried to Bu Hyeon-dong.\n“M-Major!”\n“Huh?”\nAt the urgent voice, he looked.\nPointing to the southwest, the lieutenant shouted.\n“Variables are popping up. The Alpha type is heading towards the E-3 barrier, not here!”\n“What?”\nBu Hyeon-dong couldn’t hide his shock at the new information.\nCurrently, most of the forces and the Gate Keepers were gathered around D-13.\nHowever, the Alpha, the leader which had the core, appeared near the E-3 barrier where a low amount of troops are.\n“What should we do?”\nThe man was unable to decide.\nEven if it was the Alpha, too many Horn Jackals are rushing to the wall they are on.\n‘Shit! This is a mess.’\nThere was a reason why the Major was worried.\nAs the individual type, the Alpha was the leader of the pack which comes from the Gate.\nThe strength and risk category of it was incomparable to the general type.\n‘Is this some kind of a mistake or coincidence?’\nLooking at the situation, it didn’t seem like the dangerous entities were driven by the intent to kill.\nThey just looked like ferocious wild monsters.\n“Major!”\nBut he didn’t have time for such questions.\n“The power that the Alpha has, it has quick mobility and...”\nTak! Tak! Tak!\nHitting a button on the radio three times, Bu Hyeon-dong spoke.\n“This is the commander.”\nMeanwhile, the infantry, the Murim warriors, and the Gate Keepers continued to battle with the Horn Jackals in front of the wall.\nThe monsters hadn’t reached the wall yet.\nIt was because the Murim warriors and those with special abilities were doing their best.\nAmong them, the most prominent ones were,\n“Hmph!”\nChachachacha!\nMoyong Geum’s splendid sword, which was slashing down the Jackals.\nEven the hard skin of the monsters was useless in front of his sword.\nThere was another person who was killing dozens of Horn Jackals alone.\n‘Let’s go Thunderbolt Sword technique.’\nChaaa!\nFour Horn Jackals were cut down at the same time.\nThe Thunderbolt Knife technique\nIt exerted great power in the hands of Peng Neung-gyeom, who belonged to the Peng clan.\n‘That technique is amazing. It looks stronger than chairman Moyong Geum’s.’\nThe president of the Six Road Toys, Yeom Ki-seop, bit his tongue.\nEven if they were all Superior Masters, the difference was clearly visible.\nIn that aspect, Peng Neung-gyeom’s ability was outstanding.\n‘... but compared to that monster.’\nHe wasn’t enough.\nHe was forced to sit on his knees and get treated like a junior. He didn’t even want to think of that situation again.\nThat was when a voice came through the radios, which were in the protective helmets.\n-Click! This is the commander from the command tower. This is an emergency. The dangerous entities’ Alpha is approaching the E-3 barrier. Murim warriors with light footwork are welcome to move.\nLight footwork.\nIt’s a basic technique that all Murim warriors learn.\nIf one learned it, one could respond effectively and even run faster than anyone at the speed of a sports car.\nFor that reason, the commander asked the Murim warriors for help.\n‘Alpha!’\nKi-seop’s eyes widened.\nThe Alpha was expected to appear near D-13.\n‘It crossed us.’\nFor the Murim warriors who participated, the core of the Alpha was the best reward.\nThey couldn’t let anyone else have it.\nPhat!\nWithout even having to think about it, Ki-seop moved to the southwest.\nHe wasn’t the only one who did this.\nPat!\nMore than 30% of the people had left the D-13 barrier at the same time.\nFrom the moment the Alpha was discovered, it was a battle for the core.\n[Huh! Everyone is aiming for it! Yi-sun-ah. Father will head there first. You lead the people of our company and follow me.]\n[Alright.]\nMoyong Geum rushed away.\nHe did his best to catch up to Peng Neung-gyeom, who was ahead of him.\n-Kwakwakwang!\nThe Air Swords had devastated the area around the bunker.\n[All dangerous objects within a 200m radius have been removed. Terminating the panel control system.]\nWith that, Chun Yeowun relaxed.\nThe presence of Horn Jackals couldn’t be felt in the 200m radius.\nChun Yeowun turned his head.\nBehind him, Geum Oh-yeon was still crying.\n“I never dreamed that I would be able to witness this in my life. The Sky Demon Sword...”\nGeum Oh-yeon’s gaze didn’t leave the sword in Chun Yeowun’s hand.\nWhen she saw the sword, which was supposed to be a legend, she couldn’t control the outburst of emotions.\nBowing, with her head on the floor, she said.\n“I apologize for not recognizing you right away. To see Chun Ma born in my time... I, I really appreciate it! I, no, the cult is blessed!”\nChun Yeowun nodded his head without saying anything.\nLike Baek Jong-so, Geum Oh-yeon thinks Chun Yeowun is the new Chun Ma.\nHe didn’t want to explain everything, so he let them assume what they wanted, and the woman spoke.\n“I have heard from Director Go that the current cult is trying to unite its forces and rebuild itself on behalf of the chairman who is in prison.”\n‘!?’\nChun Yeowun’s eyes narrowed.\nHe listened to her words.\n“Nevertheless, it’s a sin that I didn’t participate in it, but yet, you have come running to this dangerous place to save an old member of the cult.”\nThud! Thud!\nGeum Oh-yeon banged her head against the ground.\nAt her words, Chun Yeowun’s eyes lit up.\n‘They’re trying to rebuild the cult?’\nIf those words were true, then the dissolved Black Sky Company didn’t actually disappear.\nThey were planning on resurrecting it secretly.\n‘Then, when she was unable to recognize me now... this woman is mistaking me for someone else.’\nChun Yeowun’s thoughts were confirmed.\nGeum Oh-yeon raised her crying face.\n“I didn’t know that the Lord would be so grown up. I only saw you when you were young. The former chairman will be so pleased.”\n‘Hmm.’\nIt seemed like she was mistaking Chun Yeowun for the grandson or son of the Black Sky Company’s chairman.\nIt seemed like she knew something.\nIt was then.\n“Chun Ma... cough.”\nThe woman suddenly coughed.\nIf it was a simple cough, it wouldn’t have mattered.\n“Cough... cough....”\nBlood was running down her lips.\nUpon closer inspection, the whites in her eyes were red, but it wasn’t because of her tears.\n‘Hm?’\nChun Yeowun approached and felt her pulse.\nHer energy was very weak.\n‘... the dantian?’\nChun Yeowun frowned.\nIf she was the wife of the previous head of the Pure Kick Clan, he thought that she must possess a fair amount of skills, but because of her destroyed dantian, she had a small amount of internal energy.\n‘She’s getting weaker. Nano, what’s wrong with her?’\n[This is due to the polluted air filled with toxic substances...]\n‘This...’\nIt was something Chun Yeowun hadn’t thought about.\nWhen the bunker was closed, the air purification was operating normally, but as the Horn Jackal broke open the door, the air from outside came in.\nAll the soldiers and Gate Keepers and even the Murim warriors outside were wearing protective suits.\n‘Her condition isn’t good.’\nHe noticed that the air quality dropped once he crossed the wall.\nHowever, it had no effect on Chun Yeowun as he was at Heavenly Master Level.\n“Cough... cough... I, I’m... fine.”\n“Don’t talk.”\nGoo!\nChun Yeowun infused internal energy into her body.\nAnd stretched out his hand to expel the polluted air around him and replaced it with wind, which was from one of the five spirit beast cores he had absorbed.\nWithin a radius of 10m, it was safe.\n“Haa... haaa...”\nShe lifted her head as if breathing became easier.\nHowever, she was already exposed, so she had to be treated quickly.\n‘Staying here is unreasonable.’\nThe presence of the Horn Jackals, which had gathered near the bunker, now began to move.\nThe two had to head inside the wall.\nTak!\nChun Yeowun lifted her body.\nFlustered, she waved her hand in embarrassment.\n“M-My Lord. You don’t have...”\n“Stay still. I will take you to the place where your son is.”\n“Ah...”\nPhat! Swoosh!\n“Ahhhh!”\nBefore she could realize it, the things around her changed.\nIt was as if she was on a high-speed train. The surroundings kept changing rapidly, and she was so shocked that she screamed.\nMeanwhile, the E-3 barrier area west of Shenyang city.\nA battle different from the one at D-13 was taking place about 200 meters away from the wall.\n“Damn it...”\nA harsh sound came from the mouth of B-class Gate Keeper Tae-pyung.\nHis face inside the protective suit was drenched in sweat.\n“It’s a total monster.”\nTremble!\nHis right arm was trembling badly.\nEven without a diagnosis from a doctor, he knew that the bones in his arms were shattered.\nDespite defending himself with telekinetic power, he wasn’t able to block the destructive power of the monster.\n“... Leader!”\nYang Tae-pyung looked at where Do Jung-rak was fighting something.\nIt was a size different from a typical Horn Jackal.\nIt was several times larger and almost the size of a bus, and it had a massive horn on its back.\nThe Alpha.\nKang!\n“Kuk!”\nOne hit from it made the man fly more than 20 meters away.\nDespite the suit and the steel skin protecting him, the force he absorbed was too great.\nThud!\n‘Haa... haa... this is completely different from a D-class hazard entity.’\nHe was an A class Gate Keeper, but still, he was unable to deal with the monster.\nActually, he was no match for it.\nThe body was much harder than a normal Jackal’s, and cutting through it with swords made of special alloys was impossible.\nThe broken sword in his hand was proof of that.\nPuck!\n“Kuak!”\nAt that moment, someone got torn by the claws of the Alpha.\nStartled, Do Jung-rak shouted.\n“Cha-kyung!”\nHe was a C-class Gate Keeper who got hit while hovering around it.\nNot just him, the Gate Keepers below C-class turned out to be incompetent for the mission.\nThe only role they played was to not take their eyes off the monster and not let it approach the barrier.\n‘Shit, what should I do?’\nIt was when he was thinking.\nChhhh!\nA blue light flew through the air and hit the back of the monster.\nThe Alpha, which was hit by sword qi, turned around angry and roared.\n“Grrrrr!”\nThud! Thud!\n“Shit!”\n“My ears!”\nThe soldiers held their ears tightly at the screech.\nEven the Gate Keepers covered their ears.\n“An Alpha. You can withstand the sword qi of this old man.”\nThe one who used that was Peng Neung-gyeom.\nAfter hearing the support request, he ran to where the monster was, but contrary to his expectations, the monster was alive even after the attack.\n‘Once more.’\nPhat!\nPeng Neung-gyeom moved towards the front of the monster and attacked again.\nAmong the techniques of his clans, the Thunderbolt Knife technique was the most destructive one.\nUnfolding it, he aimed for the neck of the monster.\nPapak!\nAt that moment, the Alpha turned at a tremendous speed.\n‘No!’\nThe Alpha, which turned to the side, swung its front foot at Peng as if to counterattack.\nSurprised, he stopped unfolding the technique to defend himself.\nKwang!\nAfter being hit, he ended up backing away.\nHe didn’t fall down like Do Jung-rak, but the force was so strong that he was on one knee.\n“Huh! Look at this guy.”\nThis wasn’t normal.\nHe knew that Alphas were strong, but this one was too strong, riling up his will.\nIt seemed like his wish to engage in a battle of life or death was fulfilled.\n“I’m excited about this. But once that man arrives, our battle will become difficult, so let’s do this now!”\nWoong!\nBlue sword qi began to rise again.\nIt was then.\nSomeone mumbled.\n“Look over there.”\n“Wh-What is that?”\n“Horn Jackals?”\nHe glanced around and saw Moyong Geum running hard from the Northwest, where the Gate Keepers and infantry were protecting the other wall.\n‘Hmm?’\nHe wondered what happened.\nBehind Moyong Geum, something unbelievable was seen.\nKwakwakwang!\n“H-How is that...”\nSome kind of fragments were bouncing up from behind Moyong Geum, who was running away from the Horn Jackals.\nThe fragments were of the Horn Jackals, which were being swept away.\nMoyong Geum, who felt something was odd, turned his head.\n‘Why is everyone reacting like this...’\nAt that moment, something faint appeared right behind him.\n“Ugh!”\nPhat!\nMoyong Geum hurriedly moved to the side.\nShhh!\nSomething passed through the path he was just taking.\nIt passed so quickly that he couldn’t see it properly, but it was a person.\n‘He outran me?’\nSince it was sudden, he ended up avoiding it, but Moyong Geum was stunned.\nWhat was even more shocking was that person seemed to be holding someone else.\n“Kwaaa!”\nThe Alpha roared.\nMaybe it noticed it too. It turned its head away from Peng Neung-gyeom and rushed towards the person who was running at the speed of light.\nDududud!\nThe floor vibrated as the heavy monster ran.\n“Th-This!”\nPhat!\nHe couldn’t lose the Alpha, so Peng Neung-gyeom followed behind it.\nHe wasn’t sure who the person running through the Horn Jackals was, but the Alpha was dangerous.\nAnd this monster had outstanding durability, which could withstand sword qi and sword energy.\n‘Even if that person is unknown, I can’t just let them bump into this monster!’\nHowever, the Alpha had tremendous speed despite its size.\nAs if it was a puma, the Alpha’s body moved so fast that no one was able to catch up to it.\n‘It’s fast!’\nTap tap tap!\nThe Alpha, who ran at such speed, roared at the man who was running.\nPeng Neung-gyeom yelled.\n“It’s dangerous! Move away!”\nIt was then.\n“What’s this?”\nThe man who was running stretched out his hand.\nChachacha!\nThe sound of something cutting through.\nCreepy!\nThe sound was so intense that it made goosebumps rise on the body of Moyong Geum, who was known to be the best in Shenyang city, and the same even happened to Peng Neung-gyeom.\n‘That’s...’\nThud!\n‘What?’\nThat scene shocked everyone.\nThe huge body of the Alpha, which was running forward like a bull, was cut in half.\nPeng Neung-gyeom was so shocked that he couldn’t close his mouth.\n‘Th-This can’t be... even sword qi wasn’t cutting it.’\nAs if the man cut something soft, it was a clean cut.",

      "content": "Sword qi.\nIt’s the expression of condensed energy in the form of qi and a sword.\nIts sharpness and destructive power were incomparable to that of simple sword energy.\nAnd the Alpha had tremendously tough skin that could even withstand sword qi.\nThud!\nThe body of such an Alpha Horn Jackal was split and collapsed.\nPeng Neung-gyeom, who had fought with it directly, couldn’t accept what his eyes were seeing.\n‘Who the hell is... ah?’\nHe was shocked by the sight.\nIt looked blurry when the man unfolded the attack because of the speed he was moving at, but the man stopped for a moment while cutting the monster.\nIt was Chun Yeowun, who was wearing a long black coat which was fluttering.\n‘No protective suit?’\nOutside the barrier is supposed to be full of toxic substances.\nPeng Neung-gyeom was able to protect his body using internal energy, despite that he wore a protective suit because he would be exposed to the toxic substances for a long period.\nBut what was even more shocking than that, was,\n‘He cut down that Alpha while holding a woman?’\nIn Chun Yeowun’s arms was a woman who seemed to be in her mid to late fifties.\nJust looking at that, he couldn’t even understand how they managed to come out here.\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun reached out to the body of the Alpha.\nCrack!\nThe section on the left side of the monster which had been split, bulged and soon something pierced out of its flesh.\nA black sphere the size of a human head.\n“Ah! The core!”\n“Core!”\nShouts came out of the mouths of the Gate Keepers around him.\nIt was the core which had come out of the dead Alpha’s body.\nThe correct name is\n[Gate Core.]\nNano explained it to Chun Yeowun.\n‘Gate Core?’\n[That’s right. It’s similar to energy points in normal monsters, but these cores are said to control the energy waves which are connected to the Gates.]\n‘You mean that energy we felt when the Gate Warning was given?’\n[Right. The Gate closes when the outer shell of the core is broken.]\nChun Yeowun nodded as if he understood Nano’s words.\nChun Yeowun’s ability to feel energy has changed a lot since he entered the Heavenly Master Level, which allowed him to feel energy differently from how ordinary people do.\nThat was why, Chun Yeowun, who was just going to cut it down and leave, stopped in front of the Alpha.\n‘It’s similar.’\nChun Yeowun sensed that the energy flowing from the core was similar to the energy wave he felt when Gate 26 opened.\n‘If this is left like this, these strange monsters will keep coming.’\n[Right.]\n‘Hmm.’\nChun Yeowun frowned and stretched out his hand.\nThe core which was protruding out of its flesh, was sucked into Chun Yeowun’s hand.\nGrab!\nChun Yeowun holding the core in his hand, increased his energy.\n‘Quite solid.’\nThe outer shell was a lot harder than he thought, but it wasn’t hard enough that he couldn’t break it.\nCrack!\nCracks formed on the black sphere.\nThe outer shell of the core began to crack like glass.\nPang!\nA strong wave of energy erupted from the cracks.\nSwoosh!\nThe wave rapidly spread in all directions when the shell shattered.\nBut something strange happened.\nAs the wave spread in all directions, the far away flock of Horn Jackals suddenly changed direction and ran towards the west.\n‘Oh-ho?’\nIt looked like they were heading back before the gate closed.\n“They’re going back!”\n“We won!”\n“Woahhh!!”\nAt that sight, the infantry below cheered.\nThem running back meant that the core was broken, an indication that the battle was over.\nBut it wasn’t all over yet.\nIn front of the wall, the officers who were standing were ordered.\n“Don’t laze around! There are still some left!”\n“Get rid of them!”\nNot all Horn Jackals were running away because the core was broken.\nOne or two km away, many retreated.\nBut a hundred or so of them remained near the wall as if they were covering for the group which was retreating.\nRather than calling them intelligent, it was more of a group instinct.\nSwoosh!\nThe outer shell of the core shattered into powder.\nBut there was something surprising in it.\nA fist-sized sphere emitting bright light like an LED light bulb.\n[Pure core.]\n‘Oh... something similar to the core of spirit beasts?’\nA great energy could be felt from it.\nAlthough it wasn’t imbued with spiritual energy unlike the cores, it still had pure energy in it.\n‘I must be lucky.’\nChun Yeowun was satisfied.\nThe annoying thing called a Gate was closed, and he had a core in his hand, it was a win-win situation.\nSince everything he had come here for was done, he had to get out quickly and heal the woman.\nThat was when someone came to him.\n“Yah, you did a very dangerous thing coming out of the walls without even having a protective suit on.”\nIt was Do Jung-rak, the leader of the Gate Keepers.\nHe was mesmerized by the sight of the Alpha being slashed in half in one strike, but he frowned at the sight of Chun Yeowun holding someone and not even wearing a protective suit.\n“Haa... Haaa...”\nGeum Oh-yeon’s face was pale.\nWorried that her condition might be bad, Do Jung-rak said.\n“It looks like she’s been poisoned by the air, are you okay?”\nWith that, he pulled something out from his waist.\nIt was a mask, which was attached to a small oxygen cylinder.\n“Use this.”\n“What is this?”\n“Emergency oxygen supply for if our helmets break and we get exposed to the toxic air. As far as I know, there’s a medicine which suppresses the toxins in the oxygen tank. It will suppress the symptoms for a bit.”\nAt the favor done by Do Jung-rak, Chun Yeowun’s expression softened.\nAfter entering this unknown world, he was the first person to show kindness on their first meeting.\nHe was touched.\n“Thank you.”\nJudging that the man had no ulterior motive, he put the core into his pocket and took the emergency oxygen mask.\nAnd made Geum Oh-yeon wear it.\nShe put the mask on and pulled the band behind her head, after taking a couple breaths, she seemed to have calmed down.\n“Oh! It’s working!”\nDo Jung-rak smiled brightly at it.\nChun Yeowun nodded.\n‘He seems like a decent person.’\nThere was nothing wrong with having a relationship with such a person.\n“I will never forget this favor. Can I know your name?”\nChun Yeowun could have expelled the toxic substances in the woman’s body if her symptoms had gotten worse, still, it was clear that he received help in the midst of an urgent situation, so he asked for his name.\n“Hahaa, what is all that? A person’s life depended on it, it’s only natural to help. I’m Do Jung-rak working as a Gate Keeper in Shenyang...”\nThen someone appeared and intervened.\n“I know it’s rude, but would it be okay to interrupt the conversation? Leader Do?”\nIt was Moyong Geum.\nDo Jung-rak frowned at the sight of him interrupting a conversation.\nThe two of them were aware of each other, and were always in a competitive relationship when it came to defending against the Gate.\n‘What is he planning?’\nIn the eyes of Do Jung-rak, Moyong Geum was a warrior and a businessman who was made of money.\nTo him, the man was obviously planning something.\nOf course, his prediction was correct.\n‘I can’t miss this opportunity.’\nMoyong Geum’s eyes were on Chun Yeowun, well, on the pocket where the light of the core was glowing from.\nHe had interrupted the conversation to get the C-class core which Chun Yeowun had obtained.\n‘I wouldn’t be able to handle that Alpha by myself, but I’m lucky that a Murim warrior got it and not the Gate Keepers.’\nWhen Gate Keepers get a core, it turns into government property.\nThat way, he couldn’t get it by any means.\nIn that regard, the young man ahead must be a Murim warrior, considering Moyong Geum’s current position in the Murim Association, he could offer money and a position in exchange for the core.\n“My young friend here has great skills. As branch director of the Shenyang Murim Association. I would like to commend this achievement wit...”\n“Do Jung-rak. I will repay you later.”\nCutting off his words, Chun Yeowun thanked the Gate Keeper.\n‘This jerk?’\nMoyong Geum’s face inside the helmet distorted.\nDo Jung-rak felt better about what happened and responded with a smile.\n“Repay me for what? The relation is all we need. Hahaha.”\nOn the other hand, the displeasure Moyong Geum felt was increasing.\nHowever, there were many eyes around him, so he couldn’t lash out.\nSuppressing his emotions, he said.\n“My young friend here seems to have a good sense of morality. I like...”\n“Then I will leave.”\nChun Yeowun interrupted him once again.\nThe suppressed emotions of Moyong Geum were released.\n“This young one is quite rude. Don’t you know who I am?”\nMoyong Geum was a person with high pride.\nAs the chairman of the Yeon Company and a branch director of the Murim Association, he thought that most Murim warriors were under him.\nBut as Chun Yeowun kept ignoring him, he couldn’t help but get angry.\n“Don’t bother me. I will find you when the time is right. Descendant of Moyong.”\n“What?”\nMoyong Geum was taken aback by Chun Yeowun’s words.\nIt was the first time that someone was speaking to him in such a manner.\nBesides, he had the title of chairman, yet he was being called the Descendant of Moyong.\n“Descendant of Moyong? Ha! Look here young one, you’re going too far. Even in the 21th century society there’s a thing called respect in Murim. Do you think that the rules between seniors and juniors are something to be taken lightly?”\nAs soon as he said that, he sent a message.\nHe couldn’t speak out loud because there were other people around them.\n[Don’t act cocky. Are you making fun of the Association?]\nChun Yeowun shook his head at the message.\nStill, Moyong Geum’s eyes turned angry.\n[I was wanting to have a nice conversation with you, but if you keep acting like this, I will have no choice but to revoke your registration as a member of the Associatio...]\nPuck!\n“Kuak!”\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun’s hand struck his neck.\nMoyong Geum, who was suddenly hit, grabbed his neck as he was pushed back.\n“Kuak... Kuak... yo... you...”\nIt was weird.\nHe was protecting his body with energy, yet the attack hurt.\nShhh!\n‘Huh?’\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun approached him and put his hand on the helmet.\nFlustered, Moyong Geum tried to cut Chun Yeowun’s hand which was holding his helmet with his sword, but\n“I told you not to bother me.”\nPak!\n“Kuk!”\nClang!\nMoyong Geum became paralyzed and the sword in his hand dropped.\nIt felt like his head was spinning.\n“Kuak... kuak...”\nBlood was dripping from his eyes, nose, ears and mouth, he trembled and then fell to the floor unconscious.\n“Ahh...”\nAn exclamation flowed out of Peng Neung-gyeom’s mouth as he watched this.\nHe thought that the man was greatly skilled as he cut down the Alpha at once, but he far exceeded his expectations.\nHe subdued a Superior Master as if it was nothing.\n‘He’s such a monster.’\nHe only looked like he was in his twenties, but he was outstanding.\nAnd in a place like this, Moyong Geum, the chairman of the Yeon Company and a branch director of the Murim Association was turned into this.\n“Father!’\nMoyong Yi-sun, who had just arrived at E-3 wall with around 30 Murim warriors from the company, rushed in.\nMoyong Yi-sun, who saw that his father collapsed after Chun Yeowun’s small attack, shouted in anger.\n“You bastard! How dare you touch him!”\nVisor!\nMoyong Yi-sun and the other warriors drew their swords.\nChun Yeowun, who looked at them, discarded his soft expression and looked at them with cold eyes.\n‘This...’\nHe thought that this would happen, and he also thought that the Peng family would intervene.\nThis was an expected situation.\nIt was then.\n“Stop!”\nSomeone intervened.\nAnd it was.\n“President Yeom Ki-seop?”\nHe was the president of the Six Road Toys.\nAt the unexpected appearance of the unexpected person, Moyong Yi-sun and the others stopped.\nMoyong Yi-sun, who was still angry, shouted at Ki-seop, the president of a competitive company who had previously belonged to the same Association, and who intervened.\n“President Yeom. This isn’t a situation you get to interfere with.”\nMoyong Yi-sun thought that the man was trying to mediate between the involved parties.\nHowever, the response was unexpected.\n“If anyone wants to attack this man, you will have to go through me, Yeom Ki-seop.”\n“Wh-What?\"",

      "content": "The president of Six Road Toys, Yeom Ki-seop, glanced at Chun Yeowun.\nOriginally, he had no intention of interfering.\nHe arrived later than Peng Neung-gyeom and Moyong Geum, but he, too, could see Chun Yeowun slash the Alpha in half.\nAnd when he saw the core in his hands, he decided.\nIf the core fell into the hands of a monster like that, who could take it?\nHe thought that it would be better to quietly go back to the company, but a golden opportunity arose.\n‘Yun Mun-pyeong. You think you’ll be given preference if you give him the company card and act like his dog?’\nHumans are strange creatures.\nIt was clear that they were in an oppressed situation, but still Yeom Ki-seop didn’t want the director of Six Road Toys to be ahead of him.\n‘Life is all about timing.’\nMoyong Geum, the only one who could oppose him, had fallen.\nWho would dare go against the Yeon Company?\nBesides,\n“Protect the president!”\nTatatak!\nSoon, the Murim warriors belonging to the Six Road Toys arrived.\nAlthough there were only 20 people, Ki-seop alone could deal with many warriors.\n‘Tch. Why did Yeom Ki-seop have to intervene?’\nMoyong Yi-sun was shocked when the man suddenly intervened.\nKi-seop was one of the four End Stage Superior Masters in Shenyang.\nAnd Moyong Geum was the only one in the Yeon company who could face him.\n‘Is he trying to fuck us over?’\nIn addition to the Gate Keepers, even the Murim warriors began to gather.\nAnd if the remaining Horn Jackals were subjugated, then everyone’s attention will be drawn to them.\nActually, the answer was simple.\nAll he had to do was take his father back without complaining.\nEnduring the humiliation could minimize the damage; it was better than fighting.\nBut his position was holding him back.\n‘Father became like this and if I step away like a defeated dog, my position, aiming to be the next head of the Association will be shaken!’\nThe position of Shenyang Murim Association director was occupied by the Moyong family from generation to generation.\nTheir company had no problem with succession as their family owns 70% of its stake.\nHowever, it would be difficult for that to happen, if their image was shattered.\nShh!\nHe was conscious of his surroundings.\nThe Murim warriors who gathered were looking at the scene with interest.\nIt was natural that they were interested, the Yeon Company, one of the most competitive companies, and an affiliate company of the Blade Six were confronting.\n‘Damn it!’\nMoyong Yi-sun looked at Chun Yeowun.\nHad it not been for what he did, the situation wouldn’t have been such a mess.\n‘President Yeom Ki-seop is a person who doesn’t move unless it benefits him, so why is he taking this man’s side?’\nMoyong Yi-sun frowned.\nWhen Moyong Geum fell, his vision became enraged.\nBut when he looked closely, the face felt familiar.\n‘Where did I see him? I’m sure that I saw this one’s face...’\nHe had a great memory.\nA face one wouldn’t forget.\nYet, he couldn’t remember where, who could...\n‘Ah!’\nMoyong Yi-sun’s eyes widened.\nHe remembered it.\nSince the man’s style changed he couldn’t remember right away, but he was the 9th man recruited by the Six Road Toys.\n‘It’s him!’\nThe one who took down all of the pursuers he sent.\nMoyong Yi-sun’s hand, which was holding his sword, trembled.\n‘He’s Yeom Ki-seop’s person?’\nWhen he was convinced that Chun Yeowun and Yeom Ki-seop were related, his anger grew even more.\nHe thought that their act was to shame and embarrass the company and its successor.\n‘This bastard.’\nHe didn’t like Chun Yeowun’s relaxed expression.\n“You don’t seem like you’ll back off!”\nKwang!\nKi-seop took a heavy step ahead.\nThe ground below his feet cracked.\nHis destructive power and both his physical and internal energy was recognized by the Murim people of Shenyang.\n“Kuak!”\nIt was turning into a battle between two sides.\nMoyong Yi-sun’s gaze went towards Peng Neung-gyeom, who was watching it from one side.\nHe was the only one who could take down Yeom Ki-seop.\n‘Father will hate this, but...’\nThere was no other way.\nIt was really fortunate that his father had collapsed.\nMoyong Yi-sun sent a message to Peng Neung-gyeom.\n[Elder. I know it’s really rude to ask this of you, but please help us out just this once, as we’re the descendants of the five great clans.]\nPeng Neung-gyeom’s eyes shimmered.\nWhen he didn’t say anything back, the message continued.\n[Only the elder can help us out; you’re the only one who can subdue president Yeom Ki-seop and the man who made my father like this.]\n[Hahaha]\n[I know that the relationship between you and my father isn’t great. But I’m different from my father. I have respected you since I was young.]\nIt’s true, Moyong Yi-sun had always been polite to him.\nPeng Neung-gyeom was the same, he always treated Moyong Yi-sun gently.\n[I’m not simply asking for help. I will give you the C-class core, if you help.]\nMoyong Yi-sun was a businessman too.\nHe knew that the most basic thing in a transaction was to negotiate with the corresponding price.\nAnd the only way to get the old man to help would be to give up the core.\n‘It’s upsetting to lose the core, but if we can reverse the situation...’\nMoyong Yi-sun looked at the man with earnest eyes.\nBut what came out was different than what he expected.\n[I’m sorry. Executive director Moyong.]\n[Huh?]\nMoyong Yi-sun looked at him with bewildered eyes.\nHe offered a huge reward, so why was he rejected?\n[W-Why?]\n[As a member of the Association, I can try and mediate. But this something which is happening between the same Association’s members, I don’t think this old man should intervene.]\nMoyong Yi-sun hurriedly sent a message.\n[That’s not true. That man behind him isn’t a member of the Association. And he’s an unregistered Murim warrior. If such a person is allowed to behave so arbitrarily, what will happen to the Association’s reputation?]\nHe spoke in such an eloquent manner.\nHe tried to convince Peng Neung-gyeom.\nHowever, the man didn’t change.\nHe sighed and spoke with regret.\n[Sigh... I’ll be honest. In this situation, I think that it would be better to step down and take your father away.]\n‘You coward!’\nMoyong Yi-sun’s face contorted.\nHe expected the man to help, but as he was rejected, he couldn’t help but get angry.\nThe five great clans, he thought that it was a thing of the past, but he thought that it should still have some weight.\n‘Now, I understand why my father hates him.’\nPeng Neung-gyeom tried to give some last advice to the young man.\n[Listen to this old man. Moyong. Considering our relationship, I will tell you this bluntly. If the situation doesn’t end now...]\n[No need. I no longer seek help from you.]\n‘Huh?’\nPeng Neung-gyeom frowned.\nHe was going to tell him something important, but seeing how he was cut off, he felt disappointed.\n[Even when your relationship with my father wasn’t good, I still respected you. But what my father said, seems to be true.]\n[Wait. Listen to what I have...]\n[No. What does it mean when you say such things when my father is in that state over there? I don’t think we need to continue this relationship with you, no, elder Peng. Thank you for what you did till now.]\n[Sigh...]\nAt those words, the old man shook his head.\nMoyong Yi-sun was unable to grasp the reality.\nHe arrived late and didn’t know who cut down the Alpha, and even if he thought that his father did, seeing his father like that in front of a strange man, any rational man could understand the situation.\nBlinded by anger and rage, he couldn’t see anything clearly.\n‘Tch tch, you are no different from your father.’\nPeng Neung-gyeom gave up.\nThe kid decided, and he wouldn’t change no matter how much he said.\nThe Moyong family cut down their relationship just because he refused a request, even Peng Neung-gyeom thought that seeing them get their noses broken would be a treat.\n‘Huh! Great. More than this...’\nWhen he couldn’t get help from the old man, he decided to try something else.\nWith that he decided to narrow down his targets.\nNothing good would come from a confrontation with the Six Road Toys.\n[President Yeom.]\nMoyong Yi-sun sent a message to Yeom Ki-seop.\nAt the sudden message, Yeom Ki-seop looked at him with doubtful eyes.\n[The person standing behind you. He’s the 9th unregistered Murim warrior recruited by the Six Road Toys, right?]\nAt that, Yeom Ki-seop frowned.\nAlthough it was a secret of the company, there were spies in the company, so he guessed that others would know about it.\nEven so, he didn’t want to acknowledge it.\n[What are you talking about? Hmm.]\n[There’s no use playing innocent. We have information. Or should I send you some proof?]\nThere was photo evidence.\nHowever, since Yeom Ki-seop denied it, he could still use it in the future.\nYeom Ki-seop looked at him and said,\n[What do you want to say?]\n[Let’s do this. After all, the guy behind you has touched my people, not just the chairman. It’s hard for me to let go of the past.]\n[So?]\n[If the president is standing up for him, it means that he’s under you, right? Please hand him over to us.]\n[What?]\nYeom Ki-seop couldn’t understand it.\nMoyong Yi-sun bit his lit and said.\n[The Yeon company will give up the bid for the munition factory that’s going to be built on the southern outskirts of the city.]\n[What?]\nAt those words, Yeom Ki-seop’s eyes widened.\nThis was a huge offer.\nThe reason why Moyong Yi-sun was ordered to be assassinated was because of the munition factory.\n‘He’s going to give up their bid?’\nIf it was a normal situation, he would have accepted the offer at once.\nIf it could be done, the Blade Six would enter the defense industry and make huge profits.\nA factory that every company in Shenyang wants.\nIf Yeom Ki-seop took the deal, he would be able to leave the affiliate and get recognized by the Blade Six.\n‘... although it’s an opportunity to increase the size of the company.’\nMoyong Yi-sun was dead set on holding Chun Yeowun accountable.\nWith this, he thought even the president of the Six Road Toys would accept it.\nUnregistered Murim warriors were the kind who could get thrown away once their work was done. And them giving up their bid was huge.\n‘Haaa.’\nMoyong Yi-sun smiled as he looked at Chun Yeowun.\nHow shocked would the man be when his defender abandoned him because of the agreement they came to.\n‘Huh. Your time will be over soon.’\nSeeing Chun Yeowun stand there arrogantly snapping his fingers, Moyong Yi-sun wanted to break his fingers.\nWhile he was in thought, Yeom Ki-seop shouted.\n“The way the Yeon Company’s executive director is making a deal with us is rotten.”\n“What?”\nMoyong Yi-sun was shocked.\n“Wh-What are you saying...”\nHe was shocked, and Yeom Ki-seop continued to shout.\n“Why are you acting all innocent? Executive Director Moyong Yi-sun, you said you would give up your company’s bid for the munition factory for your own sake. No matter how incompetent you are, making such a dirty request for your needs is against the morals of the Murim Association!”\n‘This... this bastard!’\nMoyong Yi-sun was at a loss for words.\nHe was revealing the secret proposal, and made it sound like Moyong Yi-sun was the culprit.\nHe was worried as he looked around.\nWhisper!\nThe murmurs of Murim warriors could be heard.\n‘Did they make a deal?’\n‘The executive director of the Yeon Company?’\nThey weren’t sure if the man would act like that, but it was as if everyone despised Moyong Yi-sun.\nIt was an embarrassing situation for him who was conscious of his reputation.\n“Wha, just what nonsense are you talking about...”\n“I’m making it clear in front of my fellow Murim warriors. If there’s even a single lie in my words, I, Yeom Ki-seop, the president of the Six Road Toys, will live like a slave!”\nKi-seop came out even stronger.\nWhen the head of a big company in Shenyang put himself on the line, it was obvious how the public’s opinion would move.\nMoyong Yi-sun was going crazy.\n“This... this...”\nHe wanted to refute it, but his mind went blank.\nThe situation was far from being rectifiable.\nAs much weight as his words as the executive director carry, the words of Yeom Ki-seop carry weight too.\n‘Sigh...’\nYeom Ki-seop sighed as people were looking at Moyong Yi-sun. Yeom Ki-seop was drenched in cold sweat.\nEarlier, while Moyong Yi-sun made a tempting offer, Chun Yeowun, who was behind him, suddenly started snapping his fingers.\nShocked, he was able to return to reality where his body held nano bombs.\n‘Did he hear us? No! That doesn’t work with telepathy! But it’s still making me tremble.’\nAll he could hear now was the snapping sound.\nAnd he heard Chun Yeowun’s voice from behind him.\n“I guess the slave part worked.”\nShhh!\nAs soon as those words were over, he disappeared.\nYeom Ki-seop turned, but couldn’t see Chun Yeowun who was carrying the woman.\nThe person behind him disappeared, and the only people who noticed the disappearance was him and Peng Neung-gyeom.\nHe mumbled as he turned back.\n“Is this all worth it?”\nSmile.\nThe expression of Yeom Ki-seop, who was nervous, brightened.\nAnd then he suddenly frowned.\n‘... no. Did I actually like him half-praising me?’ ⁽¹⁾\nFor a second he thought he was going crazy.\nMeanwhile, in the abandoned factory in the southwest of the city.\nThere was a person who couldn’t stand still and kept moving around.\nIt was Baek jong-so.\nHe’s been freaking out since Chun Yeowun left to save his mother.\nHe actually wanted to go together, but Chun Yeowun said that he would only get in the way and asked him to keep an eye on Neung Do-myung.\n“Sigh. Sigh.”\nThe sound of sighing from Baek Jong-so was making Neung Do-myung feel frustrated.\nHe felt like he was living on borrowed time.\nLooking at how Baek Jong-so acted, if Chun Yeowun was unable to save his mother, then it was definite that he would die on the spot.\n‘Damn it...’\nHis heart was filled with despair.\nIn the place where the gate was open, was there even a way to rescue a person from outside the wall?\nHe gave the coordinates, but it seemed impossible.\n‘When he comes back, I will die.’\nIt was painful how he was feeling despair.\nIt was when he was looking at Baek Jong-so, who was walking back and forth with a dark expression.\nKiik!\nThe sound of the door to the factory opening echoed around.\n‘Ah!’\nBaek Jong-so looked at the door with a trembling heart when he felt a presence.\nBut at the entrance.\n“Oh my...”\nNot Chun Yeowun, but a man was standing with a machine gun.\nThe man was shocked at the sight of all the officers dead on the ground.\n‘Ugh?’\nDo-myung’s eyes fluttered.\nThe man who appeared was someone he knew well.\n“Lee Myeong!”\nIt was Lee Myeong of the 3rd team of the violent crimes squad, who had been suspended.\nWhile he was scared that Chun Yeowun would appear, this was nothing short of a miracle.\nHe screamed out.\n“Lee Myeong, team leader! Did you bring reinforcements?”\nUnfortunately, it was impossible for a suspended officer to bring reinforcements.\nSeeing the situation inside of the abandoned factory and the appearance of Neung Do-myung, Lee Myeong aimed his gun at Baek Jong-so and shouted.\n“Don’t move! If you move, I shoot!”\n“Tch!”\nBaek Jong-so pulled out a dagger from his sleeve.\nIt wasn’t a pistol, but a machine gun that was being aimed at him, so he had to be careful.\n‘Please...’\nNeung Do-myung was lucky, and he hoped that Lee Myeong would shoot Baek Jong-so.\nThe man shouted again while aiming his gun.\n“This is your last warning. If you don’t surrender, you’ll be killed unconditionally.”\nLee Myeong was never this kind of person.\nHe brought a machine gun with him because he was prepared to kill in order to deal with that Murim warrior.\n‘We were always told to aim for the heart.’\nIt was when Lee Myeong was about to pull the trigger.\nBaek Jong-so suddenly shouted with a bright face.\n“Mother!”\n‘Mother?’\nAt that sudden shout, Lee Myeong missed his timing to pull the trigger.\nAnd someone grabbed the back of his neck from behind.\nGrab!\n“Ugh!”\nHe was shocked as it was sudden, but the voice was familiar.\n“Wasn’t getting hit by a bullet enough for you?”\n‘Thi-This voice?’\nIt was impossible to forget the voice in such a short period.\nChun Yeowun, who had used his body as a shield against a sniper rifle.\n⁽¹⁾Damn Chun Yeowun making grown-ass men want to serve him lmao",

      "content": "‘Damn, damn it...’\nNeung Do-myung couldn’t hide his shock.\nHe didn’t expect much, but he was hoping that Lee Myeong, the 3rd team’s leader, would at least hit Baek Jong-so.\nBut before such a miracle happened, Chun Yeowun appeared.\n“Kuak!”\nLee Myeong was caught by his neck from behind.\nBesides,\n‘He... he really saved her?’\nHe couldn’t believe what he was seeing with his own eyes.\nThe woman he was holding was Geum Oh-yeon.\nHe knew her because he personally arrested Baek Jong-so and her at their home and then transported her outside the wall.\n“Damn it, just how?”\nThe Gate Warning alarm was sounded.\nWhen a gate opens, disaster strikes.\nThe outside must have been a battlefield, and saving that woman was nothing short of a miracle.\n“Mother!”\nTears flowed out of Baek Jong-so’s eyes.\nWhen he saw his mother, who was unharmed, his legs trembled.\n‘He really saved her... ahh!’\nHe looked at Chun Yeowun with eyes which began to trust him even more.\nAfter leaving the cult, the two played no role, yet they were being looked after.\nHowever, someone was suffering in that situation.\n“Kuak! Yo-You...”\nLee Myeong, who was caught by his neck, couldn’t move.\nThis was the second time.\n‘I got caught again?’\nIt was embarrassing and humiliating for him.\nIt had been so long since he felt humiliated, the first was when he wasn’t able to perform martial arts like the others in his family.\n‘My hands feel numb too.’\nHis eyes fell on the machine gun which was dropped on the floor.\nWith his neck grabbed from behind, his body went stiff, unable to move.\nChun Yeowun spoke to him.\n“I showed you a favor, but here you are prepared to do something that offends me again?”\n‘Favor?’\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, Lee Myeong’s eyes fluttered.\nIf he hadn’t listened to the doctor in the emergency room, he wouldn’t have thought much of what Chun Yeowun said.\n[You said that you’re the leader of a Public Security Bureau team, indeed, this is the work of a professional.]\n[Sorry?]\n[Hmm. I’ll have to take a closer look to find out more, but at first glance, this bullet pierced very cleanly. Both in the shoulder and the thigh, the bullet went through flesh and not bone.]\nBut he thought that it was a coincidence.\nBut after listening to Chun Yeowun, he knew that it was on purpose.\n“Kuak...”\nHe wanted to say something, but the back of his neck was grabbed and he couldn’t speak.\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun released his hand.\nHe thought that his struggling legs would naturally touch the floor, but\nFloat!\n“W-What is this?”\nHis body was floating in the air.\nConfused, but he knew what it was.\n“This is!”\nAs a child of a Murim family, he knew the basics.\nHe knew what it was, but he never thought that someone could actually do it.\nHe wondered if he could move his body, but he couldn’t.\n“Ughh!”\nWith that, Chun Yeowun let Geum Oh-yeon go to the ground.\nGeum Oh-yeon looked at Baek Jong-so who was standing in the middle of the factory with trembling eyes.\nAs if waiting, Baek Jong-so ran towards her.\nSwoosh!\n“My son. Sob!”\n“Mother.”\nThe two hugged each other with tears running down their faces.\nThe son was in tears because of his guilt and longing for his mother, and the mother was just happy to see her son alive.\nThe two lived each day in despair.\nBaek Jong-so even had a nano bomb planted in his body for the sake of his mother who was taken hostage.\nGeum Oh-yeon, who held her son, was thinking about the time when she was outside the wall.\nIt was a miracle for them.\n‘What’s wrong with them?’\nLee Myeong, who didn’t know what had happened, was confused.\nHe knew that they were mother and son, but he couldn’t figure out why they were hugging and crying.\n“It looks like you don’t know.”\nLee Myeong looked at Chun Yeowun at his question.\n“What do you mean?”\n“If you’re a detective at the Public Security Bureau, shouldn’t you know what your people have done?”\nAt that question, Lee Myeong frowned.\nEven if he was in the same Bureau, information is usually not allowed to spread around, especially not to different departments.\nMoreover, information control was even tighter when it came to the Mobile Strike Team, who were all dead in the abandoned factory.\n[If the Six Road Toys have figured it out, he’s of no use.]\n-Click.... Do you want to throw him away?\n[Isn’t that why we took him in?]\n-Click! Alright.\n[I’ll send you a location, so have team leader Go guide and gather all of the 4th and 5th strike teams and special agents.]\nLee Myeong had heard that information as he wiretapped the director’s office.\nHe found out a dark side of Sang Yu-geun, who he trusted and followed.\nHe still couldn’t forget the last words he heard.\n[His identity record will be completely destroyed, report to me once you kill him.]\nLee Myeong wanted to see it with his own eyes.\nWas this all happening according to what he heard?\nHe was confused.\n‘Then those corpses?’\nSeeing the dead Mobile Strikers made him wonder if the Director was taking too huge of a risk.\nHe really couldn’t understand what was going on.\n‘Hmm?’\nChun Yeowun’s eyes lit up.\nSeeing Lee Myeong, it was as if the man knew nothing.\n‘This is fun.’\nThen, he wondered how he would react if he told him the truth.\nChun Yeowun reached out to the side of the abandoned factory.\n“Woah!”\nThen, Neung Do-myung, who was unable to move due to his blood points being sealed, was dragged.\nNeung Do-myung, who was dragged in front of Chun Yeowun, didn’t know what to do.\nAnd Chun Yeowun said.\n“This one doesn’t seem to know anything, tell him what you guys did.”\n“T-That...”\nNeung Do-myung was speechless.\nWhat they were doing was confidential.\nThere are a lot of things the bureau did which the general public or ordinary detectives weren’t informed of.\n‘Damn it, why is this guy making me do this?’\nSince he brought a machine gun, he thought Chun Yeowun would kill him.\nBut he never thought that such an embarrassing situation would be created.\nIt was then.\nTak! Bang!\nA nano bomb on the left side of his chest exploded.\n“Kuak!”\nThe man screamed.\nThe pain when nano bombs exploded in his palm and soles was indescribable.\nAnd the pain in his chest wasn’t any less.\n‘My-My chest!’\nHis left nipple was blown away.\nIt was a nano bomb, but the explosion burned his clothes, and Lee Myeong frowned seeing that.\n‘Nipple...’\nHe couldn’t speak.\nA finger snapped, and the chest seemed hurt.\nTo the man who was in pain, Chun Yeowun said.\n“Tell him.”\n“Shitt...”\n“Looks like the words aren’t coming out.”\nChun Yeowun raised his hand and then folded one finger after another.\n“Eik!”\n/strong>\nNeung Do-myung’s face turned pale, not knowing what to do.\nIt would be better to die than to give out something so important, but the word sacrifice wasn’t an easy thing to do.\nWhile he was hesitating, Chun Yeowun’s fifth finger folded.\nSnap! Bang!\n“Kuaaakkk!”\nThe right nipple of Neung Do-myung was blown away.\nLee Myeong, who couldn’t bear seeing the man in pain, tried to stop it.\n“Stop it! How can you do such a thi...”\nTatak!\nHowever, his blood points were sealed and he was forced to shut his mouth.\nChun Yeowun stretched out his fingers again and looked at the lower body and said.\n“This time it’s on the bottom.”\n‘!!!’\nThe eyes of the man trembled.\nThe place where Chun Yeowun’s gaze fell was a place where the pain would be unbearable.\n‘Oh-no!’\nJust the thought was terrifying.\nAs Lee Myeong was also a man, he closed his eyes so he wouldn’t be able to see what would happen.\nSss!\nOne finger folded.\nAt that moment, Neung Do-myung shouted with a mad man’s voice.\n“I will tell you! I will tell you everything!”\nA declaration of surrender.\nChun Yeowun lowered his hand.\nNeung Do-myung, who almost lost that place, revealed the truth.\nWhat they do, the 3rd special division of the Public Security Bureau, and the Director’s orders.\n‘H-How... could you do such shameful things!’\nHearing about them, Lee Myeong was unable to hold his expression.\nHis disappointment in the Bureau couldn’t be expressed in words.\nSince he was a detective, sometimes he too placed traps to conduct investigations and attract criminals, he even didn’t hesitate to work undercover.\nHowever, he never took a civilian hostage to achieve the desired results.\nOn top of that, the public security decided to remove the person because the mission failed.\n‘And all of this was under the director’s orders...’\nHe couldn’t believe it.\nHe never dreamed that Director Sang Yu-geun, who values integrity and uprightness, would do such a thing.\nWhen a person’s sense of justice and value collapses, the disappointment of those around them reaches its peak.\nLee Myeong’s eyes were red.\nNeung Do-myung, who revealed the truth, looked at Lee Myeong who looked disappointed and bit his lip.\n“Don’t look at me like that. Is it wrong to make sacrifices to prevent crime? How, how do you maintain justice without that?”\nLee Myeong shook his head.\nThose words sounded like a cowardly excuse.\nNeung Do-myung bit his lip harder; this time drawing blood.\n“You do realize that in order to light up the darkness, we need to head into the darkness, right? The director and I entered the darkness.“\nEven when it was said, Neung Do-myung’s words didn’t seem satisfactory.\nWould Lee Myeong have been fine with it if he knew it from the beginning?\n“Kuk, you think it’s ridiculous to say something like that. Don’t pretend to be naïve like you’re any different from us. Your family, too, has built a business under the guise of being a political faction, and spilled more blood than this.”\nFlinch!\nAt those words, Lee Myeong’s eyes became heavy.\n“I don’t know if I will survive here, but look at the records when you get out. Your family’s company has done a lot of dirty things, more than you could imagine. Team leader Moyong Lee Myeong.”\n“Moyong Lee Myeong?”\nChun Yeowun mumbled.\nWhen he first looked at the dantian of Lee Myeong, he thought that the man belonged to a Murim family, but he didn’t think that he was actually from the Moyong clan.\n“Are you the 3rd team leader of the violent crimes squad? Lee Myeong?”\n‘How?’\nWhen his identity was said by Chun Yeowun, Lee Myeong’s eyes went wide.\n“Huh, this is nice.”\nChun Yeowun stroked his chin.\nThe name was written on the Blade Six’s instruction paper.\nThere was an order to secure the one called Moyong Lee Myeong of the 3rd team, so he was curious about who the person was.\n‘Is it related to this?’\nChun Yeowun’s gaze moved to Lee Myeong’s dantian.\nHe was about to say something to him, but then someone came over and fell in front of him.\nShe was Geum Oh-yeon.\n‘...?’\nNeung Do-myung and Lee Myeong were puzzled by the sight of her in tears.\nNext to Geum Oh-yeon, Baek Jong-so was restless.\nIt seemed like the mother and son had ended their reunion.\n‘Hmm. We’ll have to talk later.’\nTaktaktak!\nChun Yeowun reached out and touched the blood points of Neung Do-myung and Lee Myeong.\nThe two men were stunned.\n“Get up.”\nDespite Chun Yeowun’s words Geum Oh-yeon spoke while still bowing on the ground.\n“My Lord, Chun Ma. Even if I die a hundred times or a thousand times, there’s no way that I can repay your favor.”\nShe sincerely thanked him.\nAside from being a member of the Sky Demon Order, she had done nothing for the cult.\nGeum Oh-yeon made an oath.\n“My Lord Chun Ma. Even though I’m nothing but a powerless woman who has lost all her weapons, I’m not a shameless person who doesn’t know grace. Please accept me so that I can contribute to your cause in any way I can.”\n‘... mother.’\nSeeing his mother like that, Baek Jong-so’s heart ached.\nShe was originally a devout member of the Cult.\nHowever, because of her belief that it couldn’t protect her son, she gave up everything and lived the life of a fugitive.\n“Give me one more chance to be a member of the cult!”\nActually, Baek Jong-so was unaware of it, but Geum Oh-yeon had destroyed her own dantian when the people who wanted to build the Sky Demon Order had approached her.\nBaek Jong-so, managed to live a nice life despite not having a father because of his mother’s love, a mother who didn’t want to put her son at risk.\nEven the ones who wanted to rebuild the cult had no choice but to let her go as she had shown her determination to abandon martial arts.\n‘And it changed like this.’\nAlthough it was a misunderstanding, Geum Oh-yeon thought that Chun Yeowun was the son of the chairman in prison.\nThe person she met then lacked the ability to rebuild the Sky Demon Order.\nShe believed that rebuilding would cause strife, and tried to bury the spirit of the Sky Demon Order inside her heart and preserve the normal life of her son.\nBut now things have changed.\n“I saw it. The absolute majestic power of Chun Ma!”\nHaving confirmed the power of Chun Yeowun, she developed a strong conviction.\nShe finally thought that the rebuilding of the Sky Demon Order would happen.\n“What are you doing? Jong-so yah! Pledge your allegiance too.”\n“Huh?”\nBaek Jong-so was puzzled at his mother’s words.\nFrom the beginning he accepted that he was a member of the Sky Demon Order, but he couldn’t understand why she was asking him to swear an oath of allegiance again.\n“Hurry!”\nWith that strong voice, Baek Jong-so fell down.\nAs they laid, she said in a loud voice.\n“The Pure Kick Clan swears allegiance to the chairman’s eldest son, Chun Yu-seong. We support Chun Yu-seong, who’s the god sent from heaven and who obtained the Sky Demon Sword, as the next Lord!”\nChun Yeowun’s eyes narrowed at that.\nIt sounded like a simple pledge of allegiance, but she said she would support him as the next lord.\n“You’re going to support me as the next Lord?”\nGeum Oh-yeon raised her head at Chun Yeowun’s question.\n“I know that it’s upsetting, but I heard that there was a dispute between your uncle, Chun Wu-kyung, and second son, Chun Yu-jang, over who would become the Lord.”\nThud!\nWith those words, Geum Oh-yeon put her head on the floor.\n“Although there are two sons who share the same blood, we support Chun Yu-seong as the Lord.”\n‘Ha!’\nAt Geum Oh-yeon’s words, Chun Yeowun put on an expression that seemed like he didn’t understand it.\nGeum Oh-yeon, who noticed that, asked in a perplexed voice.\n“N-Not just us, but the other sects will also support Chun Yu-seong if they find out that you are Chun Ma!”\nWith that, Chun Yeowun could understand where the discussion was headed.\nThe Black Sky Company, no, the Sky Demon Order was dismantled, as if that wasn’t enough, the reason to not rebuild the cult was that there was a dispute over who would become the next Lord.\n‘Why... why is he like that?’\nShe swore allegiance to him and told him that she would support him, but Geum Oh-yeon couldn’t raise her head as Chun Yeowun said nothing.\nBaek Jong-so, who had never heard about the cult’s situation, was also confused.\nChachachachacha!\nChun Yeowun’s black wrist guard turned into the Sky Demon Sword.\nChun Yeowun, holding the sword, lowered the tip of it to the floor.\nThud!\nA crack occurred on the center of the floor where the Sky Demon Sword was placed.\nIn a voice filled with anger, Chun Yeowun said something that the two people couldn’t understand.\n“The Cult has been messed up very badly.”\n“Wh-What do you mean by that?”\nChun Yeowun pulled something out of his pocket and threw it on the floor.\nIt was an elaborately crafted jade plate.\nIn the middle of the jade plate, with the seal of the first Chun Ma, the words Sky Demon Order was written.\n24th Lord of the Sky Demon Order, Chun Yeowun.",

      "content": "Ten Thousand Mountains lie between Guangxi and Guangdong.\nAt the peak of one of the Ten Thousand Mountains, there is a shrine for the Sky Demon Order.\nAnnual events are held there every year at the beginning of New Year’s Day.\nIn the shrine there are glass boxes containing the past Lords’ jade plates and items.\nBut only a few had the opportunity to see the inside.\nAmong the clans in the Sky Demon Order, only the 12 high clans, the Guardian family, and the Lord’s direct descendants were allowed inside.\nPure Kick Clan.\nOriginally, it was a decent clan, but since Baekgi became one of the Six Swords it later became a high clan.\n28 years ago, all the high-ranking members of the Sky Demon Order, including the members of the Pure Kick Clan, gathered at the shrine for the last time when the Lord, Chun Wu-jin, was summoned for prosecution.\n[Mom... mom...]\n[Shh. Jong-so. Be quiet.]\nGuem Oh-yeon hushed the young Baek Jong-so.\nA meeting was progressing inside the Shrine.\nThe atmosphere didn’t seem good, and the families of each clan, who were waiting outside the meeting hall, kept silent.\n[This... look here.]\nDespite her hushing, Baek Jong-so pulled her hand.\nThe place where he took her to was the exhibition hall where the items of the past Lords were stored.\nBaek Jong-so pointed to a display and said.\n[Mom. Mom. That.]\nBaek Jong-so pointed to where the identity plates of the past lords were.\nInside the glass was a total of forty three jade plates, including the founder of the cult’s plate.\n[I think someone stole something.]\nThere was an empty site.\nThe site was where the jade plate of the 24th Lord, who succeeded the 23rd Lord Chun Yujong, was supposed to be.\n[Aren’t we supposed to report that to the police?]\n“Aigoo. My son.” (Aigoo is basically just a deep sigh)\nGeum Oh-yeon hugged Baek Jong-so and said.\n[It isn’t that someone stole the plate of the 24th Lord.]\n[Then?]\n[The 24th Lord has turned into the Demon God and he’s protecting the Sky Demon Order. Which is why we don’t have the plate.]\n[Wow!]\n[Son, be quiet.]\n[Hehe.]\nActually, she was kind of lying, Geum Oh-yeon also didn’t know the exact reason.\nIf one looked at the cult’s historical records, which had been handed down from generation to generation, it looked like the 24th Lord had suddenly disappeared.\nHe was the last Lord of the Chun family who held the title of Chun Ma (Heavenly Demon).\nThe people of the cult had many doubts about the disappearance of the man who was the second Chun Ma and who saved the cult.\nIt was said that the Six Swords believed that the 24th Lord would return, even on their deathbeds.\n‘If the jade was simply lost, then a new one would’ve been made...’\nShe, too, couldn’t understand just what had happened.\nAnd most cult members thought that the missing jade was a part of the Sky Demon Order’s history, a legend.\nThak!\n24th Lord of the Sky Demon Order, Chun Yeowun.\n‘!!!’\nAn engraved jade plate with words and the seal of the first Chun Ma fell on the floor.\n/strong>\nGeum Oh-yeon’s eyes wavered when she saw it.\nBaek Jong-so was the same.\n[The 24th Lord has turned into the Demon God and he’s protecting the Sky Demon Order.]\nHe recalled his mother’s words.\nThe jade plate that was missing from the shrine of the cult, which wasn’t open to anyone.\nWas now in front of them.\nAnd the seal of the first Chun Ma proved that it was not a fake.\n‘Just how did... ah!’\nGeum Oh-yeon, who was looking at that, suddenly remembered something.\n‘The 24th Lord and the last holder of the Sky Demon Sword, disappeared.’\nSince he had the Sky Demon Sword, it could be explained.\nIf the eldest son, Chun Yu-seong, found the missing Sky Demon Sword, then there was a high chance that he found the 24th Lord’s jade plate along with his body.\nIf one thought about it rationally, how could a person from a thousand years ago still be alive?\nBut she still couldn’t understand why the man was angry.\nThat was when Chun Yeowun opened his mouth.\n“Since when did the cult turn into a mess? Give me the details.”\n“Yes?”\nShe couldn’t understand the question.\nIt didn’t make sense that Chun Yu-seong, the eldest son of the chairman, didn’t know why the company was dissolved.\nWhen part of the reason was him.\nUnlike her, who was puzzled by the situation, Baek Jong-so had different thoughts.\n‘Is-Is that really possible?’\nJust one question.\nJust a single affirmation was needed.\nUnlike Geum Oh-yeon who was denying the possibility that he is the 24th Lord, Baek jong-so was thinking of explanations.\nEverybody knows that it’s impossible for humans to live for a thousand years.\nBut there’s an exception for every rule.\nSince the Gates opened, high-level people with special abilities and warriors have been able to live for over a hundred years.\n‘And when I saw... him for the first time...’\nChun Yeowun didn’t seem like a man of the current age.\nHe had long hair and he was wearing a historical costume; it was a standard look of the old cult.\nBut besides thinking that it was weird, he didn’t think too much of it\nBaek Jong-so raised his head and looked at Chun Yeowun.\n‘And that energy...’\nNo, it wasn’t internal energy.\nIt was just Chun Yeowun staring down in anger.\nIt was an aura that could be felt from those who were beyond the mortal plane.\nBaek Jong-so lowered his head without realizing it.\nHe couldn’t even make eye contact with Chun Yeowun.\nBaek Jong-so, who was confused, quietly sent a message to his mother, Geum Oh-yeon.\n[Mother. I know it doesn’t make sense but... it seems to be right.]\nShe was unable to respond because her dantian was broken, so she whispered.\n“What the hell are you saying?”\n[It seems like he’s the 24th Lord!]\n“What?”\n[I-I can’t believe it either...]\nHe was saying that it was true.\nHe was so excited that he could feel his heart pounding.\nThud!\nWith his head on the floor, Baek Jong-so asked.\n“Are you really the 24th Lord?”\nThe man in front of him was someone who hasn’t lied yet.\nGeum Oh-yeon, who was bowing, also glanced up at Chun Yeowun with suspicious eyes.\nChun Yeowun said to them.\n“You might be the descendants of Baekgi, seeing how many doubts you have.”\n‘!?’\nThe two of them were shocked by the way he uttered Leader Baekgi’s name, the 14th head of their clan, as if he was a subordinate.\nThe way he said it was so natural that they were slightly more convinced that he was the 24th Lord.\nAt that time, Geum Oh-yeon frowned and asked one more thing.\n“I-I know that this could be rude, but is it okay if I ask just one more thing?”\nChun Yeowun didn’t answer her.\nAnd she continued.\n“Leader Baekgi, the 14th head of our family, said that he received a favor from the 24th Lord, when you first met. Did you know that?”\nIt was someone only Geum Oh-yeon knew, as she was the wife of the last Pure Kick Clan head.\nAnd it wasn’t something the other clans would know either.\n‘Is mother trying to confirm it?’\nSince Baek Jong-so has been on the run for most of his life, he didn’t know many details about his clan.\nGulp!\nGeum Oh-yeon looked at Chun Yeowun with tensed eyes, fearing that he might be offended.\nBut unexpectedly, Chun Yeowun’s reaction was,\nA smile!\n“It isn’t like him to leave a record of something like that.”\nThe Baekgi he knew was the kind of person who didn’t like other people knowing his personal stuff.\nHowever, it seemed like Baekgi had left a record of the favor that Chun Yeowun had shown him early in the academy.\nActually, in the past he didn’t expect Baekgi to take his side after that.\n“Are you talking about the time when I detoxified the poison in his body during our stay at the Academy?”\n“Gasp!”\nGeum Oh-yeon covered her mouth with her palm.\nAnd her eyes were wide open.\nWhat Chun Yeowun said was almost identical to what Baekgi had written.\nBaekgi himself had written it.\n‘How... how can this be?’\nShe was so startled that she was at a loss for words.\nHer whole body kept shaking and she wasn’t able to say anything.\n“Haa... Haa...”\nShe began to have a hard time breathing.\nWhen she was saved from outside the wall, she thought that she wouldn’t witness another miracle in her life.\nBut that was no miracle.\nA real miracle was happening right before her eyes.\n‘Demon God... Demon God... Demon God...! It is him!’\nShe looked at Chun Yeowun while her body shook, and then she banged her head on the floor.\nThud! Thud! Thud!\n“Mo-Mother!”\nBaek Jong-so was shocked.\nBlood was dripping down from her forehead as she hit her head too hard. Then with her arms raised up and red eyes, she cried out.\n“All hail the Great Sky Demon Order! Long Live the Order! A member of the insignificant Pure Kick Clan sees the legendary 2nd Generation Chun Ma, the Demon God! Please forgive me for my rudeness!”\n‘!!!’\nGeum Oh-yeon had admitted it.\nBaek Jong-so, who heard that, looked at Chun Yeowun with trembling eyes.\nIn front of him was the master of the jade plate, which was missing from the shrine he saw when he was a kid.\nAnd at that, a thousand years later!\n“Ahhh!”\nBaek Jong-so immediately put his head down and shouted.\nThud!\n“The leader of the Pure Kick Clan, Baek Jong-so! Greets the 2nd generation Chun Ma and the Demon God of the Great Sky Demon Order!”\nThe legend of the Sky Demon Order wasn’t a lie!\nThe true Lord and Master of the Sky Demon Order had appeared.\nThe issue didn’t die down easily.\nWhen they saw the one called the legendary person of their clan, their emotions intensified.\nChun Yeowun had to stop it.\n“Control yourselves.”\n“Huh?”\nWoong!\nHe waved his hand, and the jade plate, which was on the ground, moved up.\nBaek Jong-so’s eyes lit up.\nChun Yeowun, who had been angry until a moment back, looked at Geum Oh-yeon.\nGeum Oh-yeon cautiously said.\n“Chun Ma. Please ask.”\n“... how did I die in the records?”\n“Huh?”\nThe title these people were calling him by was different from what his descendant Chun Mu-seong called him.\nIt was definitely a different time axis.\nHowever, the title he had here was Demon God.\nIt was the title he earned in his own time, which was changed thanks to his descendant.\n“Ho-How means...”\n“Answer what I asked.”\n“How can I say...”\n“Answer me.”\nAt the stern command, she spoke in a trembling voice.\n“I-I apologize, but we don’t know what happened clearly. It was recorded that Chun Ma disappeared in the western part of Liaoning while he was returning to the Cult from Changbai Mountains.”\n‘!?’\nChun Yeowun’s expression hardened.\nHe vaguely guessed it.\nBut only after hearing those words from Geum Oh-yeon he was sure.\n‘This... is the world I disappeared from?’",

      "content": "Chun Yeowun’s eyes turned heavy.\nIt’s only been two days since he jumped into this time and space, but when he found out that this was the world he disappeared from, his thoughts became complicated.\n‘After I disappear... this is how the future unfolds.’\nHe would have felt a lot better if he fell into a world he had no connection with.\nHowever, when he heard that this world was the one he belonged to, even if he was the Demon God, he lost his composure.\n‘Ah!’\nChun Yeowun was curious about people other than Baekgi.\n“Do you know what happened to the cult after I disappeared?”\nGeum Oh-yeon couldn’t hide her fluster at that question.\nThe Sky Demon Order had a vast history of over 1800 years.\nNo matter how high ranking the members of the cult were, it was impossible to have a detailed explanation on what happened to all of them, they didn’t even know what exactly happened to more recent members.\n“I-I’m sorry. It’s believed that it’s recorded in the cult’s records, but after the cult was dissolved...”\nShe didn’t say anything else, but Chun Yeowun could guess.\nHer silence meant that the location of the records was unknown.\nChun Yeowun frowned at that.\n“Then, do you know about the one called Mun Ku?”\nChun Yeowun was most concerned about the well-being of his lover, Mun Ku.\n“Mun Ku... Mun Ku... ah!”\nGeum Oh-yeon pondered the name, and then it seemed like she remembered something.\n“Wasn’t she your wife?”\n“Wife?”\nChun Yeowun smiled very subtly at the word ‘wife’.\nAlthough they weren’t married, Mun Ku, who had his child, was nothing less than a wife.\nBut then he heard something else.\n“The mother of the 25th Lord of the Cult, Chun Un-ku.”\nAccording to Geum Oh-yeon, his wife named their child a combination of their names.\nIt was like using a character from both his and her names.\nChun Yeowun’s eyes softened at it.\n‘... to be named after the two of us.’\nAs soon as he heard it, he knew Mun Ku’s emotions.\nAnd missed her even more.\nIn order to go back to her, he needed a time pack or time jet, which can move through time, but such devices were impossible to find in this era.\n‘I’m in trouble.’\nMaybe he had to wait until they were made.\nIt wasn’t an impossible task for Chun Yeowun who absorbed the cores of the five spirits beasts and gained eternal life, but that would take too long.\n‘I need to figure something out.’\nGeum Oh-yeon, who looked at him, asked with a curious face.\n“How come you didn’t ask about the 2nd lady...”\n“2nd lady?”\nAccording to Geum Oh-yeon, only the married ones were called ladies.\nHowever, there was no way he would marry anyone other than Mun Ku.\n“2nd lady Wang Yogun?”\n“Haa...”\nChun Yeowun put his hand on his forehead, as if it was absurd.\nWhen Chun Yeowun was in Murim, he only had connections with two women.\nOne of them was Wang Yogun.\nShe was the daughter of Wang Jing, the Martial Dual Sword, one of the five strongest warriors in Chun Yeowun’s era.\nUnlike Mun Ku, who he knew well, his relationship with Yogun was because of an unfortunate incident.\n‘So that’s how it ended up? Sigh.’\nHe could guess what happened.\nPeople treated Yogun like Chun Yeowun’s lover.\nAnd maybe they thought both women were important to him.\n‘Haha... Mun Ku allowed it.’\nHe knew the other woman far less than Mun Ku.\nNevertheless, in the end, Wang Yogun turned into the second wife.\nChun Yeowun, who made two women turn into widows, shook his head.\n‘Wang Yogun...’\nThat was just another reason to go back.\nIn any case, Geum Oh-yeon told Chun Yeowun the names of the Sky Demon Order’s successive Lords and what she knew about them.\nBut that didn’t matter to him.\nWhat mattered was why the cult became like this.\n“Why did the cult collapse?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s disappointed tone, Geum Oh-yeon bowed her head.\nIt was because she was ashamed to explain that to the 2nd generation Chun Ma, who led the most glorious period of the Sky Demon Order’s history.\n“We apologize, Chun Ma.”\n“Enough. Tell me.”\n“... I don’t know the full story since I wasn’t there, but I heard it from my husband, the former head of the Pure Kick Clan.”\nAlthough she was a member of the cult, she wasn’t in a position where she could access all the information.\nSince she didn’t have a major rank, she probably wasn’t even allowed to attend the meetings, and as she mentioned, she learned everything from her husband.\n“Perhaps this was what triggered the cult’s collapse.”\nIt was 28 years ago.\nWhen the First Dimension Gate opened.\nBefore that, Murim wasn’t a world which existed in the light.\nMurim was just something which was seen in movies and dramas.\n“At that time, the only people who knew of the real Murim were the famous Murim warriors who held high positions in the business world.”\nIt was the same as it was in the past.\nOnly officials, the imperial family, and merchants recognized the existence of Murim.\nBut, the Murim warriors who operated in the shadows had to appear because of the Dimension Gates that opened all over the world.\nThe Gates suddenly opened.\nAnd many disasters sprang out from them.\nAs of that day, Murim and the special humans who were hidden away from the world rose to the top and many things in the world changed.\n“When I was young, there were no federation governments such as the Asian Federation or the European Federation.”\nHowever, the world changed as cities were destroyed by Gates.\nThe world, which judged that no single country could win against them, began to unite and changed into federation governments.\n“There were a lot of problems in the process.”\nNot all nations wanted to join.\nThe People’s Republic of China was one of them.\nAt the center of the strong opposition to the federation system was President Wei Jinyong.\n“... at that time it occurred.”\nA massacre happened in the city of Huyunpai, which was adjacent to Russia, during a meeting with the prime minister of Russia who, like the People’s Republic of China, opposed the system.\n“Massacre?”\n“Yes. It was such a huge event that it was talked about in the world news for weeks.”\nThere, the president of China and other key figures, even the prime minister of Russia and their foreign minister were all assassinated.\nWithout that incident, it would have been difficult for the Asian Federation to be established.\n“Hmm.”\nEven Chun Yeowun was a little shocked.\nThe worst happened only after the Gates opened.\nHowever, the problems continued.\n“Something... something went wrong. I still don’t believe what happened.”\nGeum Oh-yeon said through clenched teeth.\n“Our chairman Chun Woo-jin was accused of doing the massacre.”\n“What?”\nChun Yeowun’s eyes narrowed.\nHe couldn’t understand why the man was suddenly involved in the genocide of two countries’ leaders.\n“It was so weird. At that time the chairman went on a business trip to the same place for business reasons.”\n“They accused him because of that?”\n“... the prosecution showed a CCTV video record of the chairman entering and exiting the summit meetings.”\n“That caught him on a CCTV camera?”\nThat was even more absurd.\nMost CCTV cameras in the building where the massacre took place were damaged.\nHowever, that one CCTV camera was fine.\n“That was the only evidence?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s question Geum Oh-yeon grunted.\nGrunt!\n“Not long after, our chairman was summoned and went to support the investigation, and then witnesses appeared and evidence was given.”\n“Evidence?”\nThe evidence was the autopsy of the bodies.\nUnexpectedly, the bodies had scars from the Sky Demon Order’s swordsmanship, a technique that only the head of the Sky Demon Order could learn.\n“What?”\nChun Yeowun was flustered.\n‘The Sword Force of the Sky Demon?’\nIt was a technique that was left for the Lords of the Cult.\nThe sword technique could never be used correctly unless the entire technique was mastered.\nThe Sword Force of the Sky Demon was a technique Chun Yeowun used.\nAnd before Chun Yeowun landed in this world, he taught the full technique to his grandfather, Chun Inji.\n“Who gave the autopsy result?”\nGeum Oh-yeon continued the story with her voice full of resentment.\n“The result... it was said that it was the common opinion shared by Murim warriors, who were dispatched by each clan to check the sword marks.”\nThe Black Sky Company, no, the Sky Demon Order, was being oppressed.\nEven in modern times, conflicts arose in Murim.\nIn such a situation, the opposing clans were brought in to check and they gave the result they wanted.\n“Forces of Justice Association, Blade Six...”\nThey all waited and then called the chairman the culprit.\nThe Sky Demon Order had enemies everywhere.\nCrack!\nThe Sky Demon Sword, which Chun Yeowun was holding like a staff, dug deeper into the ground.\nHis eyes were cold with anger.\n“Chun-Chun Ma!”\n“Continue... keep going.”\nGeum Oh-yeon, who was bewildered by the heavy voice of Chun Yeowun, continued.\nIn the end, the prosecution asked the court to sentence Chun Woo-jin to death.\nSince leaders of two nations were killed, the Black Sky Company couldn’t do anything.\nMoreover, as that happened when Murim was appearing from the shadows, it drew even more attention.\n“We appealed to save the chairman.”\nGeum Oh-yeon’s eyes were red.\nJust thinking back on all she had been through, she could feel the anger rise again.\n“But nothing worked.”\nThey made an appeal with the best lawyers in the company, but nothing could be done because of the evidence which pointed to the chairman.\nEven the lawyers said that avoiding sentencing was difficult.\n“The only thing the lawyers could do was avoid the death penalty.”\nThe defense counsel requested negotiations with the prosecution.\nThey informed them of what the side effects would be if the chairman was executed.\n“In the end, the prosecution took a step back and pushed for life imprisonment, instead of the death penalty.”\nThe reason was simple.\nAs the Gates opened, people like Murim warriors were needed.\nIn such a situation, if the chairman of the Black Sky Company, one of the four major clans, was executed, then they wouldn’t help.\nAfter changing the punishment, the state decided to utilize the power of the Black Sky Company.\n“But there was something that us and the government overlooked.”\nIt was the movement of the Murim clans.\nEach clan was in conflict with the Sky Demon Order and they didn’t miss the opportunity to corner the cult.\n“But they weren’t the only ones.”\nAt that time the Black Sky Company was looked at as a company which killed the leaders of two nations, and people boycotted it, their stock price plummeted, and the company deteriorated in a year.\n“Amidst all that...”\nShe couldn’t hold back her emotions.\nShe hesitated, until Chun Yeowun spoke in a cold voice.\n“Tell me.”\nShe continued while feeling sad.\n“There was a struggle for the succession of company management.”\nThe absence of the chairman, the largest shareholder and the Lord of the Cult, lead to greater deterioration.\nNo matter what happened, in such a situation where public opinion changed, someone had to fix it.\nAnd the solution was, become the next chairman.\n“Because of that the internal situation was even worse.”\nNormally one of the chairman’s two sons would have to succeed.\nHowever, because of the chairman’s absence there was no decision maker and the dispute arose.\nThen the worst happened.\n“... Chun Woo-kyung, the younger brother of the chairman, objected to the succession.”\nHe pointed out that the two sons were incompetent and argued that the company would go bankrupt or dissolve if one of them took power.\nThat objection gained the support of many members, and then the company divided into three groups.\nEven if they tried to overcome their bad reputation, because of the internal war, nothing would happen.\n“In the end, only disputes continued, nothing was resolved, and it reached a point where the situation couldn’t be fixed...”\nThe Black Sky Company was officially dissolved.\nAll of that was what led to the Sky Demon Order’s current state.\nGeum Oh-yeon was in tears.\nShe couldn’t even lift her head to look at Chun Yeowun.\n‘So this was what happened...’\nBaek Jong-so was shocked.\nHe heard about what happened to the Sky Demon Order for the first time and felt ashamed.\nAlthough it wasn’t the only reason, it couldn’t be denied that the family’s fight was what led to its current state.\n‘It’s natural to be angry. And ashamed too.’\nGeum Oh-yeon noticed that Chun Yeowun wasn’t saying anything.\nIt wasn’t her fault, but as a member of the cult she couldn’t face Chun Ma.\nShe tried to look.\nDudududu!\n“Ugh!”\nThe abandoned factory began to tremble.\nBaek Jong-so jumped at the sudden movement.\nJkkk!\nCracks appeared in the walls of the building, it looked like the building would collapse at any moment.\nBaek Jong-so was bewildered and tried to tell Chun Yeowun that they had to leave.\nBut,\n‘Ah?’\nHe discovered the cause of the shaking.\nThe Sky Demon Sword in the ground was shaking.\n“Ch-Chun Ma!”\nGeum Oh-yeon looked at him with bewildered eyes.\nA terrifying force was escaping from his body.\nChun Yeowun was unable to contain his emotions.\n‘To hear this...’\nIt was so absurd that he was pissed.\nHe never dreamt that those who inherited his blood would disappoint him so much.\nShaking!\nChun Yeowun looked at the two people in front of him.\nThey were not sure about what had to be done.\nThe mother and son were a part of the Pure Kick Clan, which was loyal to the Sky Demon Order.\nThey kept hiding and wandering around as fugitives.\n‘My descendants made the Sky Demon Order like this?’\nCrack!\nRumble!\nAs his anger increased, part of the building began to collapse.\n“Chun Ma! Please calm your anger!”\nBaek Jong-so shouted as he covered his mother to make sure she wasn’t hurt.\nHe was sure that the building would collapse.\nTak!\nChun Yeowun removed his hand from the sword.\nShhh!\nThe shaking and the cracking, everything stopped.\nThe two of them looked at Chun Yeowun with eyes full of fear.\nAnd he, who was silent, opened his mouth.\n“Descendants of the Pure Kick Clan. You must have been through a lot.”\nUnexpected comforting words came out of his mouth.\nThey thought they would be punished, but when warm words came out, tears welled in Geum Oh-yeon’s eyes.\nThud!\n“Ch-Chun Ma! How can you say that? What a shame we are as descendants!” ⁽¹⁾\nShe yelled as she put her head on the floor.\nChun Yeowun looked at them and shook his head.\n“You did nothing wrong.”\nWith that, he pretended to pull something up with his hand.\nThe Sky Demon Sword, which was in the floor, was pulled out.\nClench!\n“There are others who have sinned.”\nChun Yeowun’s eyes were as sharp as the sword in his hand.\nThe mother and son looked at him with puzzled expressions.\nCalming his emotions, he made a decision.\nThe decision was.\n“I’ll make it right.”\n‘!!!’\nAt those words, both Geum Oh-yeon and Baek Jong-so trembled.\nIt was because Chun Yeowun, the second generation Chun Ma, said he would rectify the Sky Demon Order.\n‘Ahh...’\nIf someone else said that, they wouldn’t have cared.\nBut hearing it from Chun Yeowun was enough to shake them to their cores.\nWith a trembling voice, Baek Jong-so asked.\n“Are you really going to bring the Black Sky Company back to life?”\n“Does it sound like I’m saying baseless words?”\n“Ah-no!”\n“After hearing that, do you think I would leave it alone? I will bring back the original Sky Demon Order.”\n“Oh oh... my lord!”\nGeum Oh-yeon looked at Chun Yeowun, whose eyes were filled with a strong will.\nAnd Chun Yeowun added.\n“Even if it can’t be fixed, I can always wipe everything away!”\n⁽¹⁾Descendants meaning descendants of the Sky Demon Order, just to be clear.\nOne last thing, this is my last chapter as editor since I’m swamped nowadays.

      "content": "Baek Jong-so looked at Chun Yeowun.\n‘What is he thinking?’\nChun Yeowun had just proclaimed that he would bring the Sky Demon Order back to life.\nBut since then, he sat still, as if he was meditating.\nHis dazed eyes were directed somewhere, and Baek Jong-so had no idea what he was thinking about.\nPrrr!\nChun Yeowun’s augmented reality was activated.\nIn augmented reality, numerous pieces of information were being organized like a spider web.\n‘The idiots of the cult are divided into three groups and in conflict. The State Council along with Public Security are trying to control Murim. The three major forces that supported the cult are no more.’\nChun Yeowun was organizing the information.\nHe was contemplating what to do.\nIt wasn’t difficult to destroy everything and rebuild.\nBut, that would be a massacre.\nMoreover, such a method will result in many other problems.\n‘What needs to be done right away...’\nThe most urgent thing right now is resolving the conflict within the cult.\nIt would be better to deal with the other matters after increasing the cult’s power.\nBesides, getting accurate information was important. Geum Oh-yeon didn’t tell him, but she was not aware of everything that had happened.\n‘Hmm.’\nShe wasn’t sure how the three groups began to fight.\n[The three groups were fighting over stuff like legitimacy and usefulness. But...]\nShe was told that neither of the Lord’s sons would give information to people unless they took their side.\nGeum Oh-yeon was disappointed, but she understood it.\nIf information was given to her, and then the Pure Kick Clan later joined another side, that information would be exposed.\nGeum Oh-yeon hadn’t been in contact with either of them for over ten years.\nA few moments ago, Chun Yeowun had asked her.\n[Did they give you a way to contact them?]\n[... yes.]\nAs Chun Yeowun had expected, both of the sons were open for talks.\n[24, 32, 94, 83, 13, 52, 62, 103, 26, 49.]\nDirector Ko gave her an essay book, and within it, was a piece of paper with numbers on it.\nIt was a number system called a contact number.\nIt was said that the paper would burn up after the numbers were looked at for 10 minutes.\n[A password?]\n[I don’t know for sure. It just fell out when I was reading an essay book in my house...]\n[Essay book?]\nAccording to the woman, it was an improvised password.\nIf so, there was a high probability that a way to contact them was written in the essay book.\nBut, there was just one problem.\n[Everything suspicious in the house was confiscated...]\nAnd it turned out that there were no books left in the house.\nThere were some things that didn’t disappear no matter how much time passed, books were one of them.\nIt was because physical texts are still more popular than electronic texts.\n‘Inside the Public Security Bureau...’\nIn order to retrieve the book, he had no choice but to head to the Public Security Bureau.\n‘Hmm.’\nChun Yeowun’s gaze turned to Moyong Lee Myeong and Neung Do-myung, who were sitting down.\nHis gaze then turned to the mobile strikers’ bodies.\nAnd finally, he looked at the mother and son.\nThe two, who didn’t understand what Chun Yeowun was doing, just ignorantly looked at him.\nSmile.\nThe corners of Chun Yeowun’s lips went up.\nBaek Jong-so, who didn’t know what the smile meant, asked.\n“What is it? Lord Chun Ma.”\nTak!\nChun Yeowun got up from his seat and said.\n“He’s the key.”\n“Huh?”\nHis gaze naturally turned to where Chun Yeowun was looking.\nHe was looking at Moyong Lee Myeong, who was on the ground.\nOn the 40 inch monitors, multiple CCTV cameras on roads and alleys in Shenyang city were being displayed on 200 screens.\nOn the monitor, all the officers were controlling the roads and alleys.\nWhen a Gate Warning would be issued, the National Guards would fight and defend the wall. The police officers of the Public Security Bureau would control the citizens to avoid confusion.\n“The transfer of 11 students from the academy on route 24 in hwa-pyeong route to a nearby shelter has been completed.”\n“It is said that police officers found three homeless people who were in the blind spot of CCTV cameras on 10th avenue and are currently moving them to a shelter.”\nTraffic monitoring reports.\nAll that was left for the Public Security Bureau was to monitor the people of the transportation department under Director Sang Yu-geun.\nIn the case of a Gate Warning, all the public security people would get deployed, except for a small number who’d stay in the office.\n“Got it.”\nDirector Sang Yu-geun, who received the reports, had a dark expression on his face.\nAs he was the leader, who had to take care of multiple tasks simultaneously, his concentration was scattered, especially regarding one thing.\n‘Why haven’t they contacted me yet?’\nHis eyes kept staring at the clock in the room.\nIt had been quite a lot of time since the operation was carried out, and he was given no news.\nThings should have been sorted out long ago. However, he hadn’t received any information, so he was bound to worry.\n‘Did something bad happen?’\nIf so, it may cause problems for his position.\nOriginally, the agents of strike teams should be involved in controlling the city of Shenyang.\nHowever, as those people of the Strike Team didn’t report back yet, whatever personnel were around had to be deployed.\n‘I had to say that they were on a special mission...’\nThe suspicions of the others would grow if they didn’t report back anytime soon.\nIt was frustrating for Sang Yu-geun, who felt like his tail had been stepped on.\n‘At a time like this, the Gate alarm went off...’\nEverything was now twisted thanks to the Gate Warning, which went off three days earlier than expected.\nHe just hoped that things wouldn’t go wrong.\nAs he was nervous, his phone vibrated.\nDrrrrr!\nSang Yu-geun looked anxiously at the phone’s screen.\n[Neung Do-myung, special task force.]\nThe long-awaited call.\n‘Why is he calling from his phone? Ah...’\nCome to think of it, he left the personal radio back in his office.\nHe looked around and then told the people monitoring the screen.\n“I am going to the Director’s office to check something. If any problem arises, call me. I will come right away.”\n“Yep!”\nSince they were busy, the agents answered without even turning their heads.\nSang Yu-geun came out of the control room, and answered the phone as he took the emergency stairs.\n“Go on.”\n-Director. Cough... cough.\n“What happened? Why are you so late?”\nSang Yu-geun asked in a hushed voice.\nHe was anxious and impatient.\n-Sorry. Mission accomplished.\nAt the positive report, his face brightened.\nHe was worried if something went wrong.\n-Cough... cough...\nAs he continued to hear him cough, he asked.\n“Are you injured?”\n-... Sorry. There was a problem.\n“Problem?”\n-The... man was too skilled... too great. Besides... he didn’t have any... nano bombs.\nUpon hearing that there were no nano bombs, Sang Yu-geun’s eyes turned serious.\nIf so, the team sent must have suffered some casualties.\nIn a hushed tone, he asked.\n“Wasn’t there a special member?”\nSpecial member.\nOne of the top seven warriors of Public Security.\nOriginally he was requested to be dispatched to other missions, but Sang Yu-geun asked him to head out to the factory.\n-... Jun Ye-myeong too.\n“What?”\nSang Yu-geun couldn’t hide his shock.\nThe word ‘too’ meant there were others.\n‘Shit!’\n-Fortunately, before Jun Ye-myeong officer.... Cough... fell.... And as I was being beaten up, team leader Lee Myeong came in time and saved me.\n“What? Lee Myeong?”\n-Yes... team leader Lee Myeong even fired a rifle.\nDirector Sang Yu-geun’s expression darkened.\nIt was a name he wasn’t expecting to hear.\n‘How did that bastard know?’\nWas he really always digging into trouble?\nYet, he never expected Lee Myeong to find the factory.\nThe mission was classified, and no other agent in the Special Taskforce knew about it.\nThe Director, who organized his thoughts, asked.\n“... is team leader Lee Myeong next to you?”\n-Cough cough. Yes. Because we have no manpower, team leader Lee Myeong is bringing in two surviving mobile strikers and a person called Mu-seong to the bureau right now.\n‘They are coming here?’\nAs if he got a headache, the Director put his hand on his forehead.\nAccording to them, three people survived.\nLee Myeong was one of them.\n-... what should I do?\nHe didn’t know how to answer the question.\nThe reason why he mentioned Lee Myeong must be to let the Director know that their secret was out.\n‘I told him not to interfere!’\nDirector Sang Yu-geun, who contemplated, narrowed his eyes.\nAnd said,\n“I’ll open the back gate of the special task force building, transport them into the 5th basement. Congratulate Lee Myeong for his helpful contribution and bring him along.”\n-Alright. We will be there in 10 minutes.\n“Okay.”\nThe call was cut.\nHe immediately left the office and headed to the main building.\nOnce he went there, he immediately went to the 5th floor and turned off all the CCTV cameras.\n‘Sigh...’\nHe really didn’t want things to turn out this way.\nHe stopped by his office and pulled out a gun along with a silencer hidden in the safe.\nIt wasn’t a gun that the government gave him.\nClick!\nHe put on the silencer and then placed the gun behind his coat.\nHe left the office with a heavy heart and entered the task force building.\nA place where ordinary detectives were prohibited from entering.\nDing!\nThe elevator opened.\nThe elevator could only reach 4 basement floors. Fingerprint recognition was required to go below.\nOnly those with registered fingerprints were allowed to go down to the 5th basement floor.\nOnly two fingerprints were registered, his and the other was a mobile strike team commander’s.\nDing!\nThe 5th basement had an hexagonal shape.\nWith six prisons and a lobby that had a desk and two chairs.\nThe only place with no CCTV cameras.\nSince it was a confidential space, cameras weren’t installed.\nAnd if one looked inside a prison, they could see bloodstains all over the place.\nUnlike usual prisons, they were full of torture tools.\nTak!\nThe Director took his seat.\nHis face, shadowed by the only existing LED light, seemed dark.\nHe was examining the gun in his hand when he heard something coming from a room, a special prison behind him.\nClang!\nWhen Sang Yu-geun turned around, a dark figure appeared.\nMouth covered with protective gear, wrists and ankles secured with special handcuffs, and naked body full of wounds.\nClank!\nThe tortured man moved.\nHe was glaring at the Director with eyes full of anger.\n“Tch Tch. You are full of energy.”\nSang Yu-geun shook his head and then turned away, as if he wasn’t interested.\nRight now, there was only one thing he wanted.\nClang! Clank!\n“Noisy!”\nAs the man continued to struggle, he pressed a button on the desk.\nClick!\nWhen he pressed it, a shutter came down from the ceiling.\nIt blocked the prison, making the noise go away.\n“Sigh.”\nThe Director sighed and put the gun back in its place.\nThat was when he saw the elevator sign light up.\nThey finally arrived.\nDing!\nThe elevator went up and then descended to the 5th floor.\nWhen its door opened, Neung Do-myung seemed to be in bad condition. He came out along two other mobile strikers who were supporting another person whose face was covered.\n“Cough... director.”\n“You have been through a lot.”\nThe Director got up from his seat.\n‘This one.’\nDirector looked at Lee Myeong.\nLee Myeong’s eyes seemed to be full of contempt as he looked at him.\n“Looks like you have a lot to say.”\nAt Director Sang Yu-geun’s words, Moyong Lee Myeong spoke in a low voice.\n“Not me. The Director has a lot to say.”\nAt that, the Director pointed to one of the chairs.\n“For now, let the superintendent sit, he doesn’t seem to be doing well.”\nAs he said, Neung Do-myung seemed to be in bad condition.\nMoreover, Neung Do-myung had an expression filled with anxiety, which seemed strange.\n‘Probably because of the casualties.’\nSang Yu-geun was troubled with it.\nAround 60 agents were killed.\nHe had to come up with an excuse to explain what had happened.\nBut before that, there was work that needed to be done.\nTak!\nLee Myeong supported Neung Do-myung and seated him.\nThen as he tried to turn.\nClick!\n‘!?’\nThe Director was aiming a gun equipped with a silencer at his head.\nLee Myeong looked at the Director with angry eyes.\n“What is this? Director!”\n“It must be frustrating. Team leader lee Myeong.”\nSang Yu-geun was puzzled when Lee Myeong didn’t seem to be shocked at his act.\n“Why do you want to kill me?”\n“Your fault. I told you not to involve yourself in this.”\n“... Didn’t I also say that isn’t something I can just back off from? And what the Director is now doing, isn’t the way Public Security would do things.”\n/strong>\nThe Director shook his head at Lee Myeong’s words.\n“You are so naïve. Do you think justice can be protected with righteousness alone? When you step into mud, you get muddy.”\n“... you are saying the same thing as the superintendent.”\n“Because it is simply the truth.”\nAlthough he was aiming the gun at Lee Myeong, the Director was smiling.\n‘He’s the director of Public Security?’\nIt wasn’t the face of the honest and upright Director that he’d known.\nAt that moment, he seemed no different from a criminal.\nIt was disappointing, and he had never imagined that the Director he looked up to would turn out to be like this.\nThe Director put his finger on the trigger.\n“Even though you were honest, you kept messing around with my work. You get what I am saying?”\n“... won’t you regret this?”\n“Regret? Are you talking about the Yeon Company?”\nMoyong Lee Myeong didn’t deny it.\nSang Yu-geun, who was about to pull the trigger, stopped and laughed.\n“Hahahaa! You are one funny person.”\n“What is it?”\n“You are just a fool running around without knowing the reality.”\n“Are you making fun of me?”\nWith displeased eyes, Lee Myeong asked him.\n“Do you think that Yeon Company would blink its eyes if you died?”\nAt that, Lee Myeong narrowed his eyes.\n“... what do you mean?”\n“The executive director even asked the state and me to never take you into the bureau, didn’t you know that?”\nAt that, Lee Myeong answered with a voice full of anger.\n“I am well aware of that. Of course he would get in the way.”\nIt has always been the same.\nHe would always get in the way.\nHowever, when it came to the police department of Public Security, it belonged to the state council, which was higher than the Murim Association, so he thought that no one did interfere.\nHe was a special recruit to the department.\nAs he was a respected and upright person who didn’t yield to external pressure, he was taken in on the recommendation of Director Sang Yu-geun.\n“I am grateful to the Director for that. But that has nothing to do with this. As a public security officer, how...”\n“Hahaha. How can you be so stupid and naïve?”\n“?”\n“Did you think I chose you because you were outstanding?”\n“Huh?”\nSang Yu-geun looked at Lee Myeong and said,\n“Initially, our duty was to look after the Murim Association and murim people. No matter how much the company did abandon you, we knew that you could be of some use to us in future.”\n“... you mean you were trying to use me?”\n“I thought I could use you if I had you by my side. But it was just a delusion. The Murim people are cold-hearted. Even if you didn’t learn martial arts, how could they kick away their own child and younger brother?”\nAt the Director’s sarcastic words, Lee Myeong’s expression was distorted.\nFrom what his Director said, he was using Lee Myeong to either monitor the company or use him as a hostage when needed.\n‘Ha...’\nWhen he heard that, his anger and doubts were all resolved.\nUnlike when he was first commissioned, the Director’s attitude slowly changed.\n“Was it... because I wasn’t useful?”\n“So sad. If it hadn’t been for this, you would have spent all your life as an ordinary detective earning a pension.”\nSaid the Director with a cold face.\nLee Myeong shook his head.\nThe upright Director didn’t exist at all.\nHe naively believed the mask that the person was wearing.\n‘He must have given up.’\nSeeing Lee Myeong feeling down, the Director felt bad.\nThe job required him to be level-headed, and if he showed sympathy for such ones, it would turn into trouble.\n“Then, goodbye.”\nHe pulled the trigger.\nPhh!\nLight flashed, and a bullet was fired.\nHowever, something felt weird.\nPpppp!\nThe bullet that should have pierced Lee Myeong’s head was floating and spinning in the air.\n“Wh-what is this?”\nPerplexed, Sang Yu-gueun didn’t know what was happening.\nLee Myeong said.\n“...Is the offer still valid?”\n“Wh-what are you talking about?”\nThe Director, who was puzzled by Lee Myeong’s way of talking, turned his head to see Chun Yeowun, who took off the mask and leaned against the prison wall with his hand stretched in the direction of the bullet.\nLike he was holding the bullet.\n“Y-you?”\nThe Director was shocked as he didn’t know what to do, but Lee Myeong, who looked at Chun Yeowun with a different expression than before, asked.\n“Are you really going to put the Yeon Company in my hands if I follow you?”\n“What?”\nAt his question, Chun Yeowun answered with a smile on his lips.\n“You think it is difficult?”\nTak! Crash!\nWhen Chun Yeowun flicked his finger, the bullet spinning in the air was crushed into powder and scattered around.\nHey guys, komuro is back to the nano world! Remember him?

      "content": "His life had been pointless.\nHe had been born and then abandoned as a child of Moyong clan, a descendant of the orthodox Murim people.\nThe only reason was that he wasn’t versed in martial arts.\nAs he couldn’t stand up to his father’s expectations, the chairman, he wandered aimlessly for about 2 years.\nIt was when he passed the Public Security Bureau exam that things started to change.\nHe had no ties with the company of Murim anymore.\nHe wanted to focus on starting a new life and forget everything he experienced in the past.\n‘Let’s live while contributing to justice.’\nLife for justice.\nA new goal for the lost man.\nThe Public Security Bureau, which looked after the people’s safety, was the perfect home.\nHe thought that darkness wouldn’t reach him as long as he stayed in the Public Security Bureau.\nHowever, all that was nothing but an illusion.\n[A guy with no horns sees what he wants to.]\nThat was what Chun Yeowun said to him when he released the blood points.\nAs soon as Moyong Lee Myeong realized it, his disappointment reached its peak, and he lost motivation.\nHe wasn’t sure what was right anymore.\nThis man, the darkness embodiment, had reached out to him.\n[I will give you a chance. Come under me. I will give you martial arts and everything you want too.]\nIf those words came out of someone else’s mouth, he would have immediately dismissed it.\nBut for some reason, this man’s words held some weight.\nHowever, for the last time, he wanted to check one thing.\nAnd he just got his answer.\n“Kueeek, Pl-please!”\nThe director Sang Yu-geun’s body was getting hurt here and there.\nIt was the result of nano bomb explosions inside the body, and there was no way he would survive.\nThe director managed to hold back the pain of four or five explosions, but when the next bomb exploded in a vital place, the pain seemed to grow unbearable.\nSang Yu-geun fell on his knees, begging for his life.\n‘... in the end, everything is the same.’\nThe disappointment lingered in Lee Myeong’s eyes.\nThe image of the upright director he held in his imagination was utterly shattered.\nThe director, who didn’t even master martial arts, seemed to have handled the pain a lot better than Neung Do-myung.\n“I will cooperate. P-please stop... stop! Stop it!”\nIn the end, Sang Yu-geun gave up his pride.\nAt first, he thought that he could accept death.\nBut that was a mistake.\nHe realized that he wasn’t that strong.\n“S-spare me please...”\nSnap!\n“Kuaaaal!”\nA nano bomb exploded inside his left thigh.\nFor a moment, he wondered if ‘that’ burst, but when he looked, it was just the thigh.\nSang Yu-geun asked with bewildered eyes.\n“I said I would cooperate, so why?”\n“I like dogs that behave like dogs.”\nShh!\nWith that, Chun Yeowun tried to snap his fingers again.\nShocked, the director fell flat on the floor and screamed.\n“I-I will do anything, please have mercy on me.”\n“Hmm”\nHe was being more polite now.\nSatisfied, Chun Yeowun stopped his fingers.\n“Phew... phew...”\nSang Yu-geun, who was afraid that another nano bomb would explode, breathed out.\nDing-dong!\nThe elevator opened, and three people were out.\nTwo men in mobile strike uniform, Baek Jong-so, and Geum Oh-yeon.\nThey came in with uniforms and helmets on.\n“Ouch...”\nAlongside Neung Do-myung, who was staggering.\nHis purpose was to access the elevator.\nBaek Jong-so approached Chun Yeowun and said,\n“We found it!”\nHe turned around and pointed to the book his mother was holding.\nHowever, Geum Oh-yeon, who was holding the book with both hands, had a flustered expression.\nDespite having the book, she didn’t seem relieved.\n“Here, this...”\n“Is this it?”\nChun Yeowun looked at the title written on the outside of the book.\n[Forty. To be fertile for a long age.]\n‘...’\nBaek Jong-so, who didn’t see the title of the book, looked down.\nChun Yeowun turned the page without feeling shy.\n[24, 32, 94, 83, 13, 52, 63, 103, 26, 49.]\nEven without Nano, Chun Yeowun was smart enough to memorize the numbers.\nLooking at page 24, there was only one phrase with a number on it.\n[Chapter 1. Even when you get older, women need to put in the effort. The first is the skin...]\n‘1’\nTurning to page 32, there was also a number with text in it.\n‘0’\nAs he kept following the pages’ numbers, he assembled all numbers...\n‘1052987642’\nIt wasn’t that hard to decode.\nAssuming that the numbers Geum Oh-yeon had given him were the right ones.\n‘This is it?’\nMost likely, it was a contact number.\nWhen Chun Yeowun looked at Baek Jong-so, he pointed to the bloody director lying on the floor and Neung Do-myung, who was leaning against the wall.\nAs the two seemed to have passed out, Chun Yeowun opened his mouth.\n“1052987642”\n“If it is 10... the area code is 010, Beijing.”\nThe Chinese government used 86 for numbers.\nEach city had an area code, and 10 was for Beijing, like Baek Jong-so pointed out.\nIf so, then Chun Yu-seong was in Beijing.\nIt was pretty surprising that he used the former capital of the People’s Republic of China for his base.\n“What should we do?”\nAt Baek Jong-so’s question, Chun Yeowun looked at Geum Oh-yeon.\nIt would be suitable for her to call the number and talk, but something didn’t feel right.\nChun Yeowun looked at Baek Jong-so and asked.\n“Can you act moderately?”\n“Huh?”\n“You just have to say what I tell you.”\nIn the end, Baek Jong-so would be the one talking.\nBaek Jong-so made the call with his smartphone.\nSince he was given such an important mission, he couldn’t wipe off the nervousness from his face, but he knew that he’d do fine as he had already worked as a spy.\nTak!\nChun Yeowun put his finger on the back of the phone.\n‘Ah?’\nBaek Jong-so looked at him curiously, and the call was answered.\nLick!\n-If it is a late-night snack, then it has to be Shumai. Sweet and delicious Shumai...\n“Oh?”\nThe only thing he heard was the for a restaurant.\nIt seemed to be a chain store of Shumai (Chinese dumplings) that he had never heard of.\nBaek Jong-so, who thought that he dialed the wrong number, looked at Chun Yeowun.\nIt was then.\nAfter the recording ended, a human voice came in.\n-Hello. This is Ochon Shumai.\nBaek Jong-so was flustered at the voice of a woman who seemed to be the owner.\n‘Wrong number?’\nBut then he changed his mind.\nIf he thought about it, it wasn’t like the other party could exactly reveal themselves to the world.\nAnd there was no way they would reveal their true identity just because someone called.\n‘What should I say?’\nHowever, his mother didn’t tell him if there was a certain code to give.\nAs he contemplated, a voice spoke.\n-If you are still in menu selection, would you like to call again after a while?\n‘Damn it! I am lost!’\nHe had no idea what to do.\n“Descendant of Pure Kick Clan, Baek Jong...”\nBefore he could finish speaking, the call seemed to be cut, and then the tone changed.\nClick! Beep! Beep!\nSuddenly, the connection cut off, and then a man’s voice was heard.\n-Who is it?\nAs the speaker was on, Geum Oh-yeon nodded at the voice.\nIt was a voice she knew.\nBaek Jong-so continued.\n“Are you Ko Wang-hyeon?”\n-... who are you, and how did you get this number?\nHe sounded confused.\nAfter thinking, Chun Yeowun told him what to say.\n“I am Baek Jong-so, the current head of Pure Kick clan. Based on the numbers in the book 24, 32, 94, 83, 13, 52, 63, 103, 26, 49 that you left for my mother, I called you.”\n-... and your mother’s name?\n“It is Geum Oh-yeon.”\nThe person on the other side said nothing.\nAfter about 7 seconds of silence, the voice came again.\n-Only your mother knows the number that leads to the phone. And please take it into account that we cannot be revealed.\n“I understand.”\n-We don’t have time. So let’s talk briefly. Tell me what happened.\nDue to some circumstances, it seemed like the man didn’t have time to talk.\nBaek Jong-so summarized what Chun Yeowun had told him.\n“There is a problem. My mother has been arrested by the Public Security Bureau.”\n-What?\n“Fortunately, I rescued my mother through the chaos of the Gate opening in Shenyang.”\n-Sigh....\nThe voice of general manager Ko Wang-hyeon seemed shocked.\nIt seemed like the situation was more serious than he expected.\nAfter a while, the man said,\n-... If I could, I would help you. I don’t know if your mother has heard of it or not, but Pure Kick clan, we are currently severing ties with it, no, the cult.\n‘Tch.’\nBaek Jong-so frowned.\nAlthough he was acting, he didn’t expect such a situation to pop up. He thought that they would come and rescue a member of the cult.\nOf course, he knew that they could abandon them too.\n“General manager Ko. The situation on our side isn’t good. If you help me this time, I will support Chun Yu-seong as the head of Pure Kick Clan.”\nHe threw the bait.\nA declaration of support from his clan, one of the top twelve clans.\nIt doesn’t matter how much they wanted to severe it. They left a contact number because they had hope.\nAnd the response came.\n-... does your mother agree?\n“My mother had suffered a lot when she was detained by the Bureau. She isn’t well, but she will agree with what I decide.”\nNow, all that was left was for them to take the bait.\nAs he was holding his breath, Ko Wang-hyeon’s voice came.\n-Such a difficult situation. How can we pretend not to care for a member when they are in such a crisis? As soon as the Gate Warning is lifted in Shenyang, the cult will dispatch its members.\nHe changed his words.\nBaek Jong-so shook his head with a disappointed face.\nBut his voice didn’t show it.\n“Thank you!”\n-Thank you. If this is your contact number... hmm. Time is up. Tracking attempts still continue. We will contact you.\nClick!\nThe man hastily hung up the phone.\n“Tracking?”\nBaek Jong-so was puzzled, but Chun Yeowun took off his finger with an upset expression.\n[Failed to track.]\nChun Yeowun was the one who tried to find the place.\nNano tried to track the place of the call, but couldn’t because the number kept changing.\nAnother 10 more seconds and he could have dug up the detour and found it, but it failed as the other side noticed it.\n‘Well, we made a tangent to the side.’\nAnd once the Gate Warning would be lifted, they would meet.\nChun Yeowun looked forward to that moment.\nDrrrr!\nAt that moment.\nHe heard a vibrating sound somewhere.\nIt was coming from the director’s phone.\nThe number appeared on the screen.\n“It is the traffic and situation control room. Probably calling for him”\nLee Myeong said as he recognized it right away.\nIn such regard, it was helpful that he was the team leader of the violent crimes unit in the Bureau.\n“Wake him.”\n“yes.”\nAt the command, Baek Jong-so removed the blood points seal.\nTatatak!\nOnce done, the director looked around with blank eyes.\nAnd then his face darkened.\nLike a person who just realized that what he hoped to be a dream was actually a reality.\nLooking at him, Chun Yeowun said,\n“Go back and do what you normally do. Fix everything that happened till now.”\n‘Tch. This one... acting like he is the boss.’\nAt the commanding attitude, Sang Yu-geun grunted.\nIf it wasn’t for the nano bombs, things wouldn’t have turned this way.\nThen something suddenly popped into his mind.\n‘Right. Currently the technological side is making a device to disarm the nano bombs.’\nIt wouldn’t take long since he already had the codes from a former MS researcher.\nWhen he remembered that, his heart lightened.\nHe couldn’t do anything now, so he would pretend to follow the man, and once he’d get rid of the nano bombs, he would pay the man tenfold back.\n“Understood.”\n“And don’t interfere in Murim matters.”\n“I will make sure not to.”\n“I will contact you if I need anything.”\n“... Alright.”\nChun Yeowun looked at the man as he answered obediently.\nBaek Jong-so, who watched him go up the elevator, said.\n“He is more docile than I thought.”\nChun Yeowun laughed and said.\n“We’ll see.”\nSomeone then intervened.\n“I think it is better to leave once we are done with things here.”\nIt was Lee Myeong.\nHe didn’t want to be in the bureau building anymore.\nHe was still in a state where he was trying to come to terms with the overwhelming disappointment.\n“We don’t know how long the Gate Warning will last, and how long the special task force building will be empty, so we need to get out of here quickly...”\n“Wait. Before that, I need to do something.”\nChun Yeowun went somewhere.\nIt was the prison that had shutters down.\nSsshh! Kiiik!\nAs Chun Yeowun pretended to raise his hands upwards, the shutter, which was lowered, began to rise.\n“Hmm.”\nGeum Oh-yeon looked at it.\nInside the pirson, was an unidentified human, covered in blood and traces of torture, with shackles and gears on his arms and ankles.\n“Ahh...”\nBaek Jong-so nodded his head.\nSeeing the shutter’s thickness, it seemed to be soundproofed. But, just in case, it was better to clear anything that could lead to them.\n“I’ll do it.”\nBaek Jong-so, who decided that it wasn’t something Chun Yeowun had to do, approached him.\nThere was no reason to do it, but unnecessary problems would arise if the man did overhear what happened and released it out.\nTak!\nBaek Jong-so grabbed his neck.\nHe decided to clench the neck and give a painless death.\nBut the moment he tried to grab the neck, the man in shackles groaned.\n“eup eup eup!”\nIt was weird.\nHe wasn’t begging for his life or rebelling.\nIt was like he wanted to say something.\n‘What is it... huh?’\nBaek Jong-so’s eyes shook as he looked at the face.\nBaek Jong-so took away the things that were on the man’s face.\n“Ah!”\n“What is it?”\nChun Yeowun asked.\n“He is an employee of that store that sells the masks.”",

      "content": "The human skin mask maker.\nIt is only known to a very few people in Shenyang’s dark world.\nBaek Jong-so visited his mother Geum Oh-yeon every year by changing his face using skin masks.\nAnd every time, he was amazed.\nThe shop walls were filled with exquisite human masks that made one wonder if it was really made with human skin.\nThe amazing thing was that the price of the mask made with such sophisticated technology wasn’t as expensive as people thought.\nEvery time Baek Jong-so went, he was the only customer.\nIt even made him wonder that if the customers were so few, how could they pay the employees.\nAnyways, Baek Jong-so had visited it regularly and memorized the faces of most of the employees.\n“Hey. How did you get caught here?”\nThey heard from Neung Do-myung that it was a place where the worst criminals were detained.\nIt was strange that this person was being held in prison and even cruelly tortured.\nOf course, according to Public Security, skin masks could be used for people to commit crimes. However, it wasn’t a first-degree crime.\n“Uhhh... uhhhhh... uuuhhhh.”\nHis way of speaking was weird.\nBaek Jong-so had taken off the gag in his mouth, yet the person didn’t speak.\nAnd when he looked closely.\n“How could he!”\nThe man’s tongue was cut off.\nIt wasn’t cut off evenly, as if the man had cut it by biting it with his teeth.\nClank!\n“Uhhhh! Uhhhh! Uhhhh!”\nThe man struggled with his hands in shackles.\nIt seemed like the person wanted to say something, but it was hard to understand the pronunciation.\n“Look here”\nBaek Jong-so took a couple of steps back, and then Chun Yeowun made a sign with his index and middle finger.\nThe shackles on his wrists and ankles were torn apart.\nCrack!\n‘!!!’\nThe man was shocked.\nThe restraints were made of a special alloy, so it wasn’t something that could easily be cut down.\nOf course, to Chun Yeowun, it wasn’t such a huge deal.\nThe shock was brief.\nThe man fell to the floor and then started to write something with his finger.\nOne stroke, and then another,\n[Room]\n‘Room.’\n[Room]\n‘Room.’\n[...]\n‘Ah!’\nChun Yeowun and Baek Jong-so exclaimed at the same time.\n“You want help?”\nThe words written on the ground were asking for help.\n“Uhhh.”\nThe man nodded and tried to write another letter.\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun grabbed his neck with his right hand.\n“Ack!”\n“Ah!”\nThe man and also Baek Jong-so, were bewildered by the action.\n“Speak.”\n“Uhhhhh?”\n“Speak so that I can understand.”\n‘!?’\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, the man’s eyes widened.\nWhat the others couldn’t because of the slurred pronunciation, was not a problem for Chun Yeowun.\n‘H-how?’\nIt was thanks to Nano’s ability.\nIt was possible, because Chun Yeowun had placed his hand on the vocal cords and analyzed it with the help of Nano.\n“Uhhhh?”\n[Really?]\nNano spoke the man’s words.\n“Don’t talk about useless stuff, say what you need to.”\n“Uhhh. Uhhhhh!”\n[Please help me. We are out of time.]\n“What do you mean, out of time?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s question, the man looked at Baek Jong-so and said,\n[Our store owner is in danger.]\nThe original voice held a lot of urgency, but as Nano was a machine, its voice held no emotions.\nChun Yeowun repeated the words he heard.\n“The owner is in danger.”\nBaek Jong-so looked at the man.\n“Huh? The owner in danger? No, what happened to you?”\nA Baek Jong-so’s question, the man’s eyes turned red.\n[Please! We don’t have time to do this now. Please help me. Please, as a member of the Cult, please.]\n“Cult?”\nChun Yeowun frowned.\nUnless he heard it wrong, the man called himself a member of the Cult.\n“Did you say you were a member of the Cult?”\n“uhhh...”\nThe man hesitated at the question.\n‘Can this one be trusted?’\nThe Black Sky Company’s position and the Sky Demon Order weren’t in a good condition.\nWhich was why people didn’t reveal it unless in time of emergencies.\nThe worried man opened his mouth, judging that Baek Jong-so could be trusted.\n[I am a member of the Sky Demon Order.]\n‘A member of the Sky Demon Order?’\nBaek Jong-so’s eyes fluttered.\nHe thought that the people in the shop were all just regular people.\nBut if they were members of the Cult, why didn’t they ever reveal or hint their identity to him?\nHe was puzzled, when Chun Yeowun said.\n“Which clan?”\nThe man was startled at Chun Yeowun’s question.\n‘Is this person also from the cult...? Then whose faction did he take?’\nCurrently, the Cult is divided into three factions.\nIn such situations, everyone had to be careful.\nHesitating on what to do, he soon decided that it wasn’t worth thinking about it and said.\n“Ghost Illusion clan.”\n“Ghost Illusion clan!”\nChun Yeowun couldn’t hide his surprise.\nHe never thought that he would hear that name from the man’s mouth.\nGhost illusion clan.\nOne of the main clans in the Sky Demon Order.\nIt was a major clan in charge of information gathering. The clan dispatched spies throughout Jianghu.\n‘That’s why they were making skin masks?’\nAs a group that controlled intelligence and spies, the people were masters in making masks, and it was a skill passed down through generations.\nOf course, the human skin mask wasn’t something that only the Ghost Illusion clan could make, but Chun Yeowun couldn’t think of another clan that would do it as perfectly as them.\n“You are from the Ghost Illusion clan?”\nGeum Oh-yeon was shocked.\nShe, too, seemed shocked to hear about the clan.\nIn a trembling voice, and as she looked at the traces of torture, she asked.\n“Is director Huan here?”\nWhether he knew her or not, the man looked at her with familiar eyes and shook his head.\n“uhhh. Uhhhh. Uhhhh.”\n[He is not here. More than that, please help the store owner. Please!]\n“Who is the owner of the store?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s question, the man spoke with an anxious face.\n[... Our head.]\nA city about 14 km southeast of the Bureau.\nAs the Gate Warning was issued, the dark night streets were filled with silence.\nAll the citizens had fled to shelters.\nA shabby building was hidden at the end of an alley in the city that had numerous buildings.\nThis particular building seemed to have a secret.\nThere was a 3rd basement floor.\nThe elevator showed only the 2nd basement floor, but there were hidden stairs leading from it to the 3rd.\nOf course, even if one was lucky enough to find the stairs to go down, the safe room was hidden.\nThis so-called safety shelter room was made of 80cm thick superalloy and couldn’t be opened from the outside without a key and a code.\n“Haaa....”\nInside, there was a man, breathing in relief.\nHe was in his forties, with a slender physique.\nThe man seemed nervous as he couldn’t take his eyes off the CCTV video screen installed in the safe room.\nThe screen was showing the stairway entrance and all the interior of the 3rd basement floor.\nBit.\nThe man bit his little fingernail.\nThe reason behind his anxiousness was that he was hiding from someone.\n‘At least the Gate Warning was issued.’\nDue to the sudden Gate Warning, the operation of the underground train had been suspended.\nTherefore, he had come back here and hidden himself.\n‘Ugh, if only they were 30 minutes late...’\nThe man would have been out of Shenyang.\nNow he just wanted to hide and survive the crisis.\nThe safe room, created in case of emergencies, was strong enough to withstand explosives, but being inside made him feel insecure.\n‘This place in Shenyang is no longer a safe place.’\nThis city’s safety was a thing of the past.\nIt was such a gloomy time.\nTitik!\n‘Uh?’\nOne of the screens on the monitor got disconnected, and the screen went black.\nThe CCTV on the lobby side of the building.\nThe man who was looking at the screen was perplexed.\n‘Run to another place!’\nAll the windows and entrances to the building were closed in response to the Gate Warning.\nThe fact that someone broke through the shutter meant...\nCrack!\nThe CCTVs kept turning off till the basement stairs.\n‘Damn it!’\nThe man instinctively knew that it was the enemy.\nFrustrated, he pressed buttons on the device under the monitor.\nThe traps on the 3rd basement floor were activated.\n‘Please don’t notice.’\nHowever, as if ignoring everything that was happening, the stairs to the basement were figured out.\nAnd the CCTV installed in the narrow hallway showed a black shadow on the screen.\nThe man tried to rewind the video.\nAnd he set it to slow mode at 8x.\nShhhh!\nThe masked man was slashing the CCTV camera with his sword at great speed.\nEven though the video was slowed, the movements weren’t clear.\nCrack!\n‘Ah!’\nAt that time, the CCTV entrance to the 3rd basement was turned off.\nNow, there were only two CCTV cameras left.\nHe thought it was one person, but there were six people.\nAmong those wearing black jackets, the one with the white stripe on his wrists was probably the captain. When he gestured, two men threw something at the CCTV.\nCrack!\nBoth cameras were broken.\nIt meant that all he could see inside the safe room was lost.\nThe only shield the man had left was the trap on the 3rd basement floor, and the wall made of superalloy.\n‘What should I do?’\nThe man’s eyes were dyed with anxiety.\nSurely the wall was strong, but it was impossible to understand what was happening outside.\nThe man lifted his weapon in the corner of the safe room.\nSweat trickled down his forehead.\nIt was around 3 minutes or so.\n“Haaa.”\nCold air began to enter the safe room.\nHe thought it was because of his breath, but then he saw white breath coming out of his mouth.\n‘T-this is?’\nJjjkkk!\nCold frost began to form on the wall of the safe room.\n‘Rapid cooling?’\nIt was then.\nWoong!\nA sharp blue blade pierced the wall of the frozen safe.\nThe sword energy made a single slash to take down the frozen superalloy door.\n‘Damn it!\nSrrng!\nThe man hurriedly tried to draw his sword.\nAt that very moment, the alloy door shattered, and someone broke into the safe room.\nThe hiding man swung his sword.\nThe Ghost Sword technique of the Flying Ghost Sword was unfolded in his hand.\nThe sword skill was so fast that it was exhilarating to see.\nHowever, the martial arts of the intruder were far superior to his.\nCahchachang!\nHe lightly blocked the flashy-looking sword and then thrust his sword through the man’s chest.\nPuck!\n“Damn!”\nHowever, a woman’s scream escaped out of the man’s mouth.\n“Found you!”\nThe masked man, who was the intruder, quickly sealed the blood points.\nTatatak!\n“Euk!”\nThe body couldn’t move.\nThe person, who was taken down without much of a fight, looked at the masked man in anger.\nThe man had special goggles on, and the eyes were the only exposed part of his face, so finding out his identity was impossible.\nClench!\nThe masked man grabbed the person’s head.\n“Ugh! Wh-what are you doing! Let go!”\nAs he shouted, the masked man lifted the grabbed head higher.\nAnd.\nTear!\nStarting with hair, the skin of the man’s face was torn off.\nWhen the skin was torn, muscles and veins had to be revealed, but instead, a face was revealed inside.\nA beautiful woman in her late twenties with short hair.\n“Huan Xia. To be hiding in this place.”\nGrab!\nAt the masked man’s words, the short-haired woman, no, Huan Xia, bit her lip.\nShe hoped everything would be resolved, but she got caught.\nThe masked man reported to the captain behind.\n“Target has been secured.”\n“Now, let’s head back.”\nHearing the masked captain’s words, the masked man put his hands on the woman’s shoulder.\n“Kyaaa...”\nTatatak!\nWhen she tried to scream, the man sealed her blood spots, making her unable to.\nHelplessly suppressed, she had no choice but to let them detain her.\nThe masked people climbed the stairs to the second-floor basement.\n‘Ah...’\nThe woman was draped over the shoulder of a masked man and was led from there.\nThey didn’t head to the building’s entrance.\nThey went to the 2nd floor above and jumped from the window as if it was the entrance.\nTak!\nIt was the typical blindspot as the building was in an alley, and darkness reigned everywhere.\nThe masked man who jumped first opened the manhole cover on the floor right in front of the building.\nThe route they used seemed to be the sewers.\n‘The clothes smelled disgusting...’\nHuan Xia thought.\nHowever, it was the optimal route as the Warning was issued, and the Bureau was everywhere blocking the roads.\n“I will head down first.”\nThe man who opened the manhole jumped down the sewer first.\nWell, he tried to.\nThe moment he jumped, a sound came.\nWoong!\n“Euk!”\nThud!\nThe masked man’s body flew upwards and crashed into the wall of the building.\nClang! Srrng!\nThe masked men, who weren’t sure what happened inside the sewer, pulled out their swords at once.\n‘What?’\nHuan Xia, who was also bewildered by what was going on, saw someone walking from one side of the alley.\nIt was Chun Yeowun, walking as his black coat fluttered.\nChun Yeowun, who approached them, mumbled under his breath.\n“Found the rats.”\nThe eyes of the masked captain narrowed.\n‘... A master.’\nJudging that the enemy was unusual, he nodded towards the manhole and told the other people who were tying up the woman.\n“Go first. I will stop him...”\nIt was then.\nSlash!\nSomething fell to the alley’s floor..\nIt was the captain’s right arm.\n‘!?’\n“Kuaaak...!”\nGrab!\n“Emp!”\nJust as the captain was about to scream, someone grabbed his mouth and lifted him up.\n‘Wh-when did he?’\nPat!\nThe masked people, who discovered Chun Yeowun, were startled as they tried to run away.\nTo them, Chun Yeowun spoke in his usual cynical tone.\n“Who told you that you could leave?”",

      "content": "‘A-Amazing!’\nHuan Xia, who was draped over the masked man’s shoulder, couldn’t hide her surprise.\nShe knew that the masked people were strong since she’d just fought with them.\nDespite not being strong like the captain, the other members were skilled enough to subdue a strong person. However, their captain himself had just lost an arm.\n‘Is he someone that father sent?’\nIt was her first time seeing that face.\nShe could feel his strength, but he looked to be only in his 20s.\nIf her father sent him, there was a high probability that it was a mask.\n‘I don’t know who you are, but please!’\nShe wanted to be saved.\n“Hmph!”\nThe captain’s mouth was blocked by Chun Yeowun’s hand.\nThe man was unable to do anything because the opponent’s energy was beyond imagination.\n‘W-who the hell is this monster?’\nKrrrkr!\nThe masked captain groaned.\nChun Yeowun warned the masked man and the others holding the woman.\n“Put down that girl and I will only cut your arm and spare your life...”\nIt was then.\nOne of the masked men, aimed his gun equipped with a silencer.\nWhat he aimed for was.\n“I am sorry.”\nPung!\nHe didn’t aim for Chun Yeowun but for the captain.\nSwish!\nThe captain’s body was moved to the side.\nIf he was even a little late, the captain’s forehead would have been pierced by the bullet.\n‘These ones, not colleagues?’\nChun Yeowun frowned.\nAlthough he was merciless to his enemies, he would never try to hurt his own men or comrades, especially not someone who was higher than him.\n‘It seems like there is no use holding one as a hostage.’\nEven in the current times, extreme training seemed to have been provided.\nIn the event of a crisis or unexpected situation, colleagues can abandon each other and even kill without showing mercy.\n“Nothing can be done.”\nChun Yeowun, determined just to subdue all of them, tried to move.\nMaking the masked man holding Huan Xia shout.\n“If you don’t want this girl dead, stop.”\nPuk!\n‘Euk!’\nThe masked man took out a knife, and put the woman down as he pointed it at her neck.\nHe threatened to kill her.\n‘Ahhh! No! I haven’t even gotten married yet! I can’t die as some lonely virgin!’\nHuan Xia seemed to be a woman with many regrets in her life.\nShe wanted to scream, but couldn’t as the blood points were sealed, so she just shook her body.\n“If you rebel, I will kill this bitch.”\nThe masked man threatened.\nWoong! Phat!\nThe masked man raised the sword qi and pointed it at Chun Yeowun.\nThe masked man had pushed the knife deeper into her neck, trying to show that he wasn’t bluffing.\nIn the meantime, a new masked man narrowed the distance to two steps in front of Chun Yeowun at once.\n“Die.”\nThe masked man’s sword qi pierced through Chun Yeowun’s neck at once.\nIt was then.\nGrab!\n“Ugh?”\nThe masked man was flustered.\n‘How is he holding a sword qi with his bare hands?’\nHe couldn’t believe what his eyes were seeing.\nChun Yeowun’s hand wasn’t cut, nor was there blood.\nAt that moment, the masked man pushed the knife a little more into the neck and shouted.\n“You mean it doesn’t matter if this bitch dies?”\nChun Yeowun snorted at it.\n“If you planned to kill her, you wouldn’t have tried to kidnap her in the first place. Besides...”\nWhoo!\n‘W-Wh... What the hell is this...’\nThe masked man’s finger that was holding the knife began to open.\nIt was as if a tremendous amount of energy was pulling it out.\nTak!\nThe knife was about to fall to the ground.\nWhen it happened.\nThe falling knife suddenly flew up and pierced the masked man’s forehead.\nPuck!\n“Kuak!”\nClang!\nThe knife was pushed so strong that it even went through the head and pierced the wall behind.\nThe masked man speechlessly fell down.\nThanks to that, Huan Xia, who was stabbed a little, fell to the ground.\nRoll!\nIn an instant, silence reigned.\nThe remaining four men were shocked.\nUnless they were seeing things, it couldn’t be the...\n“A-Air sword!”\nAir Sword\nLiterally, it was a state of handling the sword as efficiently as speaking.\nIt was possible to do it at Supreme Master level, at which people became a lot better at the execution of sword techniques.\n“Supreme... Master!”\n“In this corner, there is a human class monster...”\nActually, Chun Yeowun was at a level higher than that.\nThe masked people who realized that their opponent had overwhelming capabilities had no choice but to hesitate.\nThere was only one thing to do if there was no way to subdue the opponent.\n“All open...”\nPak!\n“Kuak!”\nChun Yeowun hit the neck of the masked man, who used a sword qi with his hand.\nThe masked man fell down, grabbing his neck.\n“Kuk!”\nPath!\nWhen they saw one of them falling, the remaining three decided to run away by unfolding light footwork.\n“Escape? I told you that I won’t let you go.”\nChun Yeowun lowered his palm.\nA tremendous energy spread over the entire alley and suppressed the masked people.\nWoong!\n“Kuak!”\n“W-what energy!”\nThe masked people who were suppressed couldn’t take another step and knelt.\nThey tried to, but it was of no use.\nChun Yeowun grabbed the neck of the man in front of him and asked.\n“Where are you from?”\nAt the question, the masked man groaned and opened his mouth.\n“Kuak. Kill me.”\nAt that, Chun Yeowun shook his head.\n“I guess that is what you want. Well it doesn’t matter to me. If you won’t speak then I can think of other ways.”\nChun Yeowun reached out to remove the mask on the man.\nWhat made life in this current world easier for him was that they always had phones in their ears and radios to get in touch with other people, their leaders.\nPerhaps, this one had that.\nIt was when Chun Yeowun grabbed the mask.\nPapapang!\nA red glow arose from the body, and a scorching heat began to spread.\nIt happened so quickly that even Chun Yeowun wasn’t able to stop it.\nPsss!\nThe masked man’s body blackened as it turned into ashes.\nChun Yeowun had seen it at Six Road Toys.\n‘Nano bomb?’\nIt wasn’t just this one man.\nAll the other masked men he defeated had turned into ashes.\nChun Yeowun’s eyebrows rose.\n“Sigh...”\nHe didn’t know who did it, but the people were killed by detonating the nano bombs within their bodies to hide their identities.\n‘So I wasn’t the one he asked to kill him.’\nPerhaps he said that to the person he was in contact with.\nNano bombs were more annoying than he thought.\nHe could prevent them from exploding if he had time, but Chun Yeowun couldn’t stop it once the explosion started.\n‘Hmm.’\nBut that didn’t mean that he couldn’t do anything.\nWith this incident, he managed to come up with a countermeasure.\n‘However, where did they come from?’\nAccording to Yu Mun-pyeong of Road Six Roys, the nano bomb was difficult to obtain due to its rarity.\nIf they could put that in all the bodies of the masked people, then it meant that the organization behind them was wealthy.\nMoreover, they tried to kidnap a Sky Demon order clan member, who didn’t even have any influence.\nAt least, there was a high probability that their target was the Cult.\nSurely this wasn’t an internal conflict.\n‘It wasn’t our Cult’s cultivation method.’\nWhile he was in thought, the woman groaned.\n“uhhhhh!”\nHer eyes were shining.\nChun Yeowun approached her with an annoyed expression and released her blood points.\nTatatak!\nThe moment she was released, Huan Xia tried to hug him.\n“Thank you! I thought I would die before getting married. Euu!”\nPak!\nChun Yeowun pushed her away.\n“Don’t push it.”\n“Euk!”\nHuan Xia fell on the floor.\nShe was actually interested in Chun Yeowun, who had an overwhelming strength.\nSo she tried to hug him to make him help her, but she failed.\n‘Ugh, I am embarrassed.’\nBeing pushed away was more embarrassing for her.\nWhen she was active, she was the centre of men’s affection. But, she never experienced someone like Chun Yeowun.\nAfter a moment, she regained her composure.\n“Hmm, thank you. For saving my life. Maybe my father sent you?”\nChun Yeowun was the only one who appeared at the right time.\nSo she assumed that her father, who knew about the crisis, had sent him.\nBut the answer that came from Chun yeowun’s mouth was weird.\n“Is this father the head of the Ghost Illusion clan?”\n“Did you just call my father ‘the head’?” ⁽¹⁾\nShe yelled at Chun Yeowun, who was treating her father like some child.\nKik!\nThen she heard the sound of a car stopping outside the alley.\nAfraid that another enemy might appear, she said.\n“L-let’s get out of this place first. Come on.”\n“Where are you going?”\n“Are you planning to fight every single one?”\nShe frowned at Chun Yeowun.\nAt that moment, she heard the sound of someone rushing from the vehicle that had stopped.\nAnd as they entered the dark alley.\n“Lord Chun Ma!!”\nIt was Baek Jong-so.\nSince the entire city was under lockdown, he took the RV vehicle of the Public Security, but Chun Yeowun moved ahead with his light footwork.\n‘He arrived much faster than the car I drove at the speed of 180...’\nSo fast that Baek jong-so was shocked.\nOf course, looking at it now, it seemed like Chun yeowun made the right decision.\nHuan Xia mumbled.\n“Chun Ma?”\nIf she didn’t hear it wrong, Baek Jong-so just said ‘Chun Ma’.\nBaek Jong-so yelled at her.\n“Hey! Don’t you know how to get down on your knees in front of Chun Ma!”\n“Huh?”\nHuan Xia couldn’t understand what was happening.\nShe knew about Baek Jong-so because she kept an eye on him under orders.\n‘Wasn’t he the outcome of a misfortune?’\nBut she couldn’t figure out why ‘Chun Ma’ was coming out of his mouth.\nChachacha!\nThe wrist guard on Chun Yeowun’s wrist disassembled and changed into a sword.\nHer soul was blown away by the appearance of the Sky Demon Sword.\nHuan Xia‘s eyes focused on the letters engraved on the sword.\n“Sky Demon Sword?”\nAt that, Baek Jong-so urged.\n“Aren’t you going to show respect even after seeing the sword?”\nHe thought that she would feel the overwhelming feeling that he and his mother felt.\nHowever, the woman’s reaction was weird.\nTatak!\nShe suddenly widened the distance between her and Chun Yeowun and then pointed to him.\n“Who are you? How dare you deceive a descendant of the head of the Ghost Illusion clan with a fake Sky Demon Sword?”\nAt her words, Chun Yeowun asked with an expressionless face and a cold voice.\n“Fake Sky Demon Sword?”\n⁽¹⁾Out of respect, he had to call her father ‘Clan Leader’. But since he’s Lord, he just needed to say ‘Head’.",

      "content": "‘Fake Sky Demon Sword? This woman must have lost it!’\nBaek Jong-so was so confused at Huan Xia’s words.\nBaek Jong-so, who considered it an insult to Chun Yeowun, shouted at her, at the woman who couldn’t recognize the real sword at once as he did.\n“Fake Sky Demon Sword! What rude words are you spouting!”\nDespite his urging, Huan Xia didn’t lose her ground and spoke.\n“Baek Jong-so, no, clan leader Baek. You are being deceived. I don’t know who that person is, but that sword is definitely a fake!”\n“Do you even understand what nonsense you are spouting? I know who this...”\n“Enough.”\nChun Yeowun cut his words.\nBaek Jong-so wanted to yell at her in anger, but Chun Yeowun stopped him.\nSeeing his cold eyes, he knew that the man wasn’t pleased with the situation.\nChun Yeowun walked towards her.\n“D-don’t you dare come closer.”\nHuan Xia took a step back.\nShe had just witnessed Chun Yeowun’s strength with her own eyes, so she was aware of the huge difference between them.\n“You need to learn to take responsibility for your words.”\nChun Yeowun pretended to lift something with his hand.\nThe body of the woman, who tried to step back, floated in the air.\n“Ahhh!”\nShe tried to raise her energy, but nothing helped her.\nIn two steps, Chun Yeowun was right in front of her.\n“Hmp!”\nTerrified, she closed her eyes.\nUntil she heard Chun Yeowun’s voice.\n“Why did you say that my sword is fake?”\n“Huh?”\nShe, who thought that the man would harm her, opened her eyes.\n“I asked you why you said my sword is a fake.”\nChun Yeowun didn’t like hearing it.\nHe thought that despite being a member of the cult, the woman wasn’t aware of the Sky Demon Sword.\nJudging from her appearance, the woman seemed to be in her late twenties.\nConsidering the period in which the Sky Demon Order was dissolved, she might not know about the real sword.\nBut the answer she gave was unexpected.\n“I-Isn’t that obvious? The Sky Demon Sword is now in the hands of the executive director Chun Woo-kyung. How could you try this with me? You must be on the side of director Chun Yu-seong, right?”\n“What?”\nChun Yeowun couldn’t understand it.\n‘Chun Woo-kyung was holding the Sky Demon Sword?’\nEven Baek jong-so, who was glaring at the woman, couldn’t hide his confusion.\nAt first, it was thought that she wasn’t aware of the sword and acted as such.\nHowever, when they heard that the Sky Demon Sword was found, he couldn’t understand it.\n“I don’t know a lot because they don’t let information pass, but we know... ugh.”\nHuan Xia couldn’t move her lips.\nHer lips trembled, but they couldn’t be moved, as if someone shut them.\n“Successor of the Ghost Illusion Clan, from now on, you only answer when I ask. Do you understand?”\n‘W-what pressure...’\nHuan Xia’s eyes trembled in fear.\nChun Yeowun’s power was suppressing her.\nIt was like being a prey in front of a tiger.\n“About these factions, which one are you supporting?”\nHe asked her with a cold voice.\nHuan Xia, who was shaking, spoke.\n“I need to move my jaw... to speak.”\n“if you spout on more useless things, I will pull your tongue out.”\n“Hik! H-how can you say such things to a woman... ahhh!”\nKeuk!\nHer tongue was forcibly being pulled out.\nThe pain spread to her throat where her tongue was connected. She then believed that Chun Yeowun wasn’t just threatening her, but serious about every single word he’d uttered.\n“It doesn’t matter if you are a woman.”\nHis eyes were proving it...\nNormal men would be shaken by a helpless woman, especially if the woman was a beauty, but Chun yeowun’s eyes were cold.\n‘He is really going to pull it out.’\nGulp!\nShe was slowly getting terrified.\nShe was too scared.\n“Speak.”\nAt some point, he was going to run out of patience and actually do what he said.\nHuan Xia spoke with tears in her eyes.\n“W-We the Ghost Illusion Clan, support Chun Yu-jang.”\nAnd the side they chose was revealed.\nThe second son.\n“You said that Chun Woo-kyung possessed the Sky Demon Sword. How does a different faction know about it?”\nChun Yeowun was more curious about the Sky Demon Sword than the factions.\nThe future in which he shouldn’t exist.\nSince the sword was never actually passed down, he wanted to know who was responsible for spreading the rumors about possessing the Sky Demon Sword.\n“W-we were sent a video by the spy we planted...”\n“Video?”\n“it is in my smartphone.”\nWhen she tried to reach out, Chun yeowun reached out his hand, and the smartphone around her wrist was pulled into his hand.\nShe spoke in urgency.\n“You need a password to open it.”\nA pin had to be pressed for the phone to unlock.\nAfter the pin, there was an iris recognition that should be done. But she didn’t speak about it.\n“The pin is ... huh?”\nTch!\nHowever, as Chun Yeowun’s hand touched the screen, the pin was automatically written.\n‘Wh-what did he do...’\nEven a professional hacker wouldn’t be able to do it without a computer.\nBut this man did it by holding the phone. It was ridiculous to look at.\nThe automatic format function would be initiated if the iris didn’t match, but then the video began to play.\n‘No way!’\nClick!\nThe screen on the phone showed a seminar room that could hold a large number of people.\nAs the video was taken secretly, it shook a lot.\n— Bring it.\nIn the video, a man standing on the podium in his mid-sixties gave an order, and four men dragged a wheeled table.\nA black cloth was over it.\n— The members of the cult who believed and followed me. Today you will see the revelation of the Demon God.\n— Woaw! Chun Ma! Chun Ma!\nPeople in the video cheered and raised their hands.\n“Is that one Chun Woo-kyung?”\n“Y-yes.”\nHuan Xia quickly answered Chun Yeowun’s question.\nShhh!\nChun Woo-kyung made a gesture to silence the audience.\nOnce he gathered everyone’s attention, he took off the black cloth on it.\nAnd on the wall of the room, the beam project was showing the contents on the table. Shockingly, it was the Sky Demon Sword and White Dragon Blade.\n“haa!”\nChun Yeowun was thrilled.\nHe wasn’t sure who made it, but if only the appearance was to be considered, the difference would be unknown.\nIn the video, Chun Woo-kyung pointed to the screen behind him.\nAnd something came up.\nThe excavation site, old bone fossil-like fragments around, and both swords were found with the jade plate.\nThe image was enlarged on the jade plate.\n[Sky Demon Order’s 24th Lord Chun Yeowun]\nThe jade plate had the exact same phrase as the one Chun Yeowun currently had.\nAnd the same seal of the Chun Ma on it.\nRather, the plate in the video was made to look old, as it was more genuine.\n‘Is he now replicating my plate too?’\nChun Yeowun’s eyes were turning angrier and angrier.\nIn the video, the man went close to the screen.\n— You saw it. The executive director has found the lost history of our cult.\n— Chun Ma! Chun Ma!\n— Do you know what this means?\nWith those words, the man raised the Sky Demon Sword and the White Dragon Blade and shouted.\n— It means that the Demon God has chosen me to be the next Chun Ma!\n— Woah! A new Chun Ma is born!\nEveryone in that room seemed to be insanely excited.\nThe shaking video ended, even the person who filmed it seemed surprised.\n— Damn it!\nThe video even recorded the cursing the man kept giving.\nCrack!\nAs soon as the video ended, the phone cracked.\n‘M-my phone!’\nHuan Xia looked at the cracked phone.\nFortunately, it wasn’t entirely cracked.\nChun Yeowun, who stayed silent, opened his mouth as his voice clearly showed anger.\n“Doesn’t matter.”\nChun Yeowun has decided.\nIt was pathetic to have internal conflict, but even more when people were making fake claims by replicating his swords.\n“Are the three factions aware of this video?”\n“ah, the higher ups seemed to know.”\n“Higher ups?”\n“If this information was released everywhere, then normal members of the cult will be shaken.”\n“Huh!”\nChun Yeowun snorted at her words.\nThe influence the name Chun Ma had on the members was absolute.\nIn terms of legitimacy, the eldest son would be right, but if the title of Chun Ma was brought into play, then it didn’t matter.\nIt was natural that the clan leaders didn’t want this information going out.\n“This was exposed on purpose.”\n“Huh?”\n“This was released on purpose to get people to see this.”\nChun Yeowun knew that the video was intentionally exposed.\nNo matter how good the spy was, it was a high probability that he wanted this to happen and brought in too many people to the room.\n‘Father said the same thing too...’\nHuan Xia was shocked.\nHer father, the clan leader of Ghost Illusion clan, was of the same opinion.\nActually, she didn’t have the right to access the information as well, but Chun Yu-jang, the faction she supported, had let her know.\nThey didn’t want their people to be shaken by what the executive director was saying.\n“Lord Chun Ma.”\nBaek Jong-so called him, worried.\nHe didn’t fall for the video as he saw the absolute power of Chun Yeowun.\nBut his anger and disappointment were growing.\n‘After seeing that video, you’re still calling him Lord Chun Ma?’\nHuan Xia thought.\nAt her father’s order, she kept an eye on Baek Jong-so, the clan leader of Pure Kick clan, to bring him into the Chun Yu-jang faction.\nShe couldn’t understand why the person who stayed away from these matters was showing such loyalty to this man.\n‘If I stay here, all the information will be taken.’\nBut the person in front of her was a monster.\nAnd he was holding her down, so how could she escape...\n‘Ah!’\nAt that moment, something flashed through her mind.\nThe words of her father, Huan Myung-oh.\n[There is no chance of encountering a strong warrior, but just in case, there is one way that the members of the higher clans use.]\nShe didn’t use it till now, so she forgot it.\nThinking back, she began to release the hidden power in her dantian.\nGoooo!\nBlack haze rose from her body as her hidden power was revealed.\nIt was gloomy and dark.\nAt that moment, Huan Xia’s body, which had been suppressed by energy, didn’t feel restricted.\nPak!\n‘Success!’\nShe didn’t think that it would actually work.\nOnly the clan leaders and the higher people in the clans inherited this demonic energy for generations.\nThe demonic energy was different from normal energy. It was based on destructive energy, so it expelled other forms of energy.\n‘I need to get out of here!’\nPhat!\nWithout thinking, she tried to move away.\nBut she took only three steps.\n“Kneel down.”\nThud!\n“Kyak!”\nA voice ordered her, and she fell.\nShe fell so bad that her knees were bleeding.\n‘What the hell!’\nShe couldn’t understand it.\nThe moment the voice was heard, her body obeyed the command.\nIt was done voluntarily.\n‘I need to get up! Get up! Get up!’\nShe tried her best to use the demonic energy, but nothing happened.\nOn the contrary, the demonic energy in her body made her feel uncomfortable.\nChun Yeowun, who approached her, said.\n“How stupid. Ghost Illusion clan...”\n“H-How...”\n“Demonic energy... Even after I disappeared, the command was followed well.”\n“What are you?”\n“Who do you think has passed down that demonic energy?”\nWooong!\nAt that moment, an energy that transcended one’s imagination soared from Chun Yeowun’s body.\nIt was as close to an abyss that encroached on everything.\n“Ugh!”\nHuan Xia began to feel suffocated at the energy soaring around.\n“Any kind of demonic energy has no choice but to succumb in front of the Sky Demon Energy.”\n“Sky, Sky Demon Energy?”\nShe heard about it.\nIt was said that it was the power that the second generation Chun Ma had created.\n‘It can’t be! I never heard of any clan that could master the Sky Demon energy...’\nHer mind denied it, but not the body.\nShe could feel the demonic energy in her body getting terrified.\n“W-who are you?”\nShh!\n/strong>\nChun Yeowun met her eyes and said.\n“I’m the one you call ancestor and Lord, I possess the title of Second generation Chun Ma, I’m the Demon God you should worship.”",

      "content": "Sky Demon Energy.\nIt had originated from a fallen dragon.\nPure hatred.\nMurderous intent.\nPitch Darkness.\nThey were obtained by killing an ascending dragon.\nIt was the Sky Demon energy that brought all of those characteristics together.\nThe first Chun Ma had left behind his technique and energy for the prosperity of his future successors.\nThe person who managed to obtain it was Chun Yeowun, the 2nd generation Chun Ma.\n‘Demonic energy.’\nBefore he disappeared, Chun Yeowun had left the demonic energy to the cult members.\nCultists, who had excellent strength, were able to absorb the demonic energy inside the corpse of the fallen spirit.\nTheir Lord had disappeared, but the demonic energy had been passed down from generation to generation and remained a symbol of the Sky Demon Order.\nThud! Thud!\nHuan Xia shouted while banging her head to the floor.\n“This lowly member of the Sky Demon Order recognizes the 2nd Chun Ma. Please forgive my act of rudeness in the presence of the Demon God!”\nThe only energy that the demonic energy could succumb to, is the Sky Demon energy.\nShe felt it in her bones.\nShe couldn’t help but admit that the man in front of her was Chun Yeowun, the 24th Lord who had disappeared.\n“Raise your head.”\n“How can an ignorant lowly member of the cult who couldn’t even recognize the true Chun Ma lift her head? I cannot do it unless I am properly punished.”\nShe was nervous and embarrassed.\nShe couldn’t forgive herself for pointing her finger at Chun Yeowun and for uttering that his sword was fake.\nShe didn’t have the confidence to look at his face.\nWoong!\nAgainst her wishes, her body flew.\nBlood was dripping from her forehead and covered her pretty face that was showing anxiety.\n“Ahh.... Lord Chun Ma.”\nHowever, what Chun Yeowun said was completely opposite to her expectations...\n“Don’t mistake this. I am not going to punish each and every one of you individually.”\n“Huh?\n“You and all the other members who are currently fighting will be punished.”\nChun Yeowun’s eyes turned cold.\nNot only was the Sky Demon Order, which held a great history and power for more than 1,800 years, disbanded, but also its members are fighting each other instead of working on rebuilding it.\nFurthermore, the Chun Woo-kyung faction had coveted the Lord’s position by putting forth a fake Sky Demon Sword and a fake White Dragon Blade. Not only that, but also the jade plate. Chun Yeowun has every reason to never forgive that man.\n“You will all be punished according to your sins, so be prepared.”\n“L-Lord Chun Ma...”\nFor a moment, Huan Xia felt terrible.\nIn Chun Yeowun’s days, it was common for brothers and sisters from one parent to kill each other to covet the position.\nIt was Chun Yeowun, the Lord and the 2nd Chun Ma, who eradicated it.\nHe made sure not to let any outside organization interfere with the Sky Demon Order’s internal affairs and made sure there was no war within the cult.\n‘Wait. Wasn’t it the 2nd Chun Ma who is said to have killed all the outsiders and cut all the arms of the brothers who were competing...’\nAlthough much had been forgotten over time, Chun Yeowun was a legendary figure with many things written regarding him.\nHe wasn’t the kind to let people go just because they were his descendants.\n“Speak.”\n“Huh? What do you mean...”\n“Tell me where your faction’s base is.”\n“T... that...”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s direct question, she wasn’t able to answer.\nRather, she wanted to know if he was asking about Chun Woo-kyung or Chun Yu-seong.\nActually, she didn’t know the location.\nThe location where Chun Woo-kyung publicly revealed the swords was found to be a random place and not their actual base.\nThe reason why Chun Yeowun didn’t mention Chun Woo-kyung’s base was because he knew about it from the data he found on the smartphone.\n“Don’t think of changing topics.”\nThud!\nHuan Xia fell on her knees and spoke with tears in her eyes.\n“My Lord. Please have mercy on me.”\nIn the end, she gave all the information she had.\nShe couldn’t even remember how many times she cried in the process.\n‘Jinan City.’\nThe base of general manager Chun Yu-jang was in Jinan city.\nIt was a city located in the northwest of Shandong province.\nFinally, he found out about the whereabouts of the three factions.\n“My Lord. I congratulate you.”\nBaek Jong-so, who swore an oath to rebuild the Sky Demon Order by following Chun Yeowun, delivered his congratulations.\nHe, too, hadn’t expected their bases’ locations to be found out so quickly.\nSince they said they would come after the Gate Warning, The location of Chun Yu-seong faction’s base could then be easily found.\n“We will be busy once the Gate Warning is over.”\nBaek Jong-so smiled.\nHowever, what Chun Yeowun said was completely unexpected.\n“I know the location, so why do I need to wait?”\n“Huh?”\nHe couldn’t understand what Chun Yeowun meant.\nThe operation of the trains was suspended until the Gate Warning was over.\nMoreover, to get to Jinan city, one would have to pass through 7 cities, taking at least 2 days.\n“My Lord. What are you talking about...”\n“Baek Jong-so.”\n“Yes.”\n“Take your mother and follow the successor of the Ghost Illusion clan to the hideout we talked about earlier.”\n“Sorry? Then, what about Lord Chun Ma?”\n“It might take longer, but I will be back in three days.”\n“What do you mean by that?”\nPhat!\nEven before he could finish his question, Chun Yeowun soared into the air.\nIt wasn’t the light footwork that he knew about.\nHuan Xia mumbled with surprised eyes.\n“N-No! Space Movement!!”\nWhat Chun Yeowun unfolded was the Space Movement, the most incredible feat one could ever do.\nA state where one can fly freely by using the internal energy.\nIt was an absolute light footwork technique that even most Supreme Masters couldn’t do.\n“... he isn’t human.”\nShe always heard about it, but never witnessed it.\nAnd now she has just seen Chun Yeowun use it as he flew into the sky.\n‘What?’\nIt was a dark night, and he was too high to see.\nPhut phut!\nAs if a rocket was launched, something moved the man as he flew to the southwest at a tremendous speed.\nHuan Xia was confused when she asked Baek Jong-so.\n“Wh-what did I just see?”\nShenyang City. Gate Defense site.\nThe atmosphere at the Gate Defense was like a festival.\nThe alpha that had to be caught was captured much sooner than expected.\n“West d-12 barrier.”\n“West D-13 barrier.”\nThe monitoring agents were reporting.\nMost of the barriers were intact, and Bu Hyeon-dong, the one in charge of the wall defense on the western wall, also reported that all the remaining entities would be cleared soon.\n‘Nice!’\nLieutenant in charge, Wei So-yong, couldn’t hide her overflowing joy.\nShe was nervous the whole time, thinking that the barrier would break, but she was fortunate.\n‘It was C class but it passed safely.’\nShe was lucky.\nOf course, behind the luck was Murim.\nAccording to a report from Bu Hyeon-dong, he said the man was an unregistered Murim, so she was curious about his identity.\n‘I want to repay his favor.’\nShe heard that the Alpha Horn Jackal, which had suddenly appeared towards the West E-3 barrier, was cut with one strike. It was deduced that if the person was a Gate Keeper, he would be an A-class or an S-class.\n‘Well, hopefully we can get the core of the alpha.’\nOccasionally, the Murim association would offer high prices for the core, so unregistered Murim warriors would often sell it to them.\nIt was when she was curious about it.\nWheeing!\nAn emergency warning light appeared on the detection radar.\nAn agent monitoring the screen shouted.\n“Commander on duty! Please look at this!”\nTatat!\nThe man typed something on the keyboard and brought it onto the main monitor.\nA radar that shone on Shenyang city.\nWoong!\nThe people in the room were confused.\nThe red dot, caught on the detector, was moving southwest across the city at a tremendous speed.\nWei So-yong, who was confused, shouted.\n“Activate the anti-aircraft defense system now!”\nHowever, before they even could do anything, the red dot had already left the city.\nIt was incredibly fast, with a speed of Mach 13. ⁽¹⁾\n“Passed Shenyang!”\nThe beeping of the radar stopped.\nAll the soldiers in the monitoring room, who were nervous, sighed in relief.\nIf this unidentified flying object hovered over Shenyang, it could’ve been a Code Red emergency.\nWei So-yong, who had lost the feel of her legs, mumbled.\n“Damn it... what the hell was that?”\nPeople were traveling on the road in RV vehicles of the Public Security Bureau.\nThey were Baek Jong-so, his mother, Moyong Lee Myeong, Huan Xia of the Ghost Illusion clan, and the wounded man from the prison.\nBaek Jong-so, who was holding the steering wheel, was talking to someone on the phone.\n“Okay. So, empty my room and the room of Ho-jeong.”\n— No! Director Yun Mun-pyeong knows?\n“Just hurry. We are hurt.”\n— Ha. Team leader Ho-jeong should’ve informed me. It would have been better.\nThe person talking to Baek Jong-so was in the hideout.\nThe hideout was where Baek jong-so and the mission team of the Six Road Toys had lived, a private bunker.\n“If that person snaps his finger, you are dead. If you have no intention to die, just do what I asked,”\nHe wasn’t wrong.\nEveryone in the hideout had nano bombs in them.\nAt those words, the person on the phone grumbled.\n— ... What is he? Thanos or something?\n“Don’t act smart and get ready!”\n— beep!\nCutting the call, Baek Jong-so sighed.\nIf there was a safer place, he would have guided them there, but at the moment, the hideout was the best.\n“Uhhh.”\nHuan Xia, who was sitting in the back seat, was holding her phone.\nShe was trying to contact her father.\nHowever, as Chun Yeowun cracked the phone, there seemed to be a problem with the communication chip. Even normal texts didn’t work.\n‘Please! Please! Just work!’\nJinan city, Northeast.\nFar out of town, there was a large lot with a lake in the front and small ridges in the back.\nThere was a 30 story building and about ten office buildings clustered. At the entrance to the site, there was a large company sign called Yongchun group.\nThe 30 story building was the headquarters of the Yongchun group.\nEven though it was late at night, there were eight suited middle-aged men. They seemed to be senior officials as they sat in a staff meeting room on the 29th floor.\nAt the very top of the table sat a man in his mid-50s, with white hair and sharp-looking eyes.\n“I definitely said no.”\n“Chairman!”\nA bearded middle-aged man in a navy blue suit said with an impatient look.\n“Director Huan. I’ve definitely said no a lot of times. The National Defense Agency said that a Gate Warning will be issued within a day or two. Where do you want to go?”\n“But I lost contact with my daughter!”\nThe middle-aged man called Huan bit his lip.\nThe chairman responded with a sad expression.\n“Gate 19 is in the North. The defense people said that the Gate could be B class or higher this time. If you are absent in such a situation, then who will control the cult members?”\nClass B Gate.\nA disaster with a very high risk.\nWhen a disaster type came, it was dangerous for everyone.\nThe chairman continued as director Huan’s expression darkened.\n“You are the most important person here. How could you, the head of an information gathering network, be unable to control your emotions?”\n“... I apologize.”\n“In any case, Shenyang city can’t be entered because of the Gate Warning there. Hold on a little. Once the warning is lifted, the cult members waiting in the city will move.”\nEven though he was speaking softly, the president didn’t want to say it.\nAs far as he knew, Huan’s daughter was an adopted one and not his real child.\nHe heard that director Huan’s clan had problems with female children because of the strong yin.\n‘She was sent there to avoid getting caught up in this war, but it still made a fuss.’\nHowever, for him, director Huan was an important person.\nAnd he didn’t want to make him feel bad.\n“Anyway, the first thing to do is to find the authenticity of the item that he said he retrieved...”\nDrrrr!\nDirector Huan’s phone vibrated.\nThe interruption irritated the chairman, but then director Huan seemed pleased for some reason.\n“Chairman! It is my daughter’s text!”\n“See. Didn’t I say that everything will be fine.”\n‘He and his daughter... sigh.’\nEspecially at the current times, it was extremely difficult to conduct a meeting.\nHowever, after reading the text, director Huan’s expression seemed to have changed.\nCurious, the chairman asked.\n“Is there a problem?”\n“I have no idea what this means. She said that...”\nDrrrr!\nAnother text came in.\n“Chun... Ma?”\n“What?”\nIt was then.\nKwakwakwang!\nA loud roar was heard from above the building.\nSomething suddenly pierced the ceiling and landed on the table.\nAt the sudden scene, everyone stepped back at once.\n“Wh-what is going on?”\nThe chairman, who also got up and moved back, had his eyes focused on something in the middle of the table.\n“Sword?”\nA precious black sword with a unique black brilliance different from a normal sword.\nIt seemed familiar.\nThere were three letters engraved on the sword. The chairman’s eyes shook as he read them.\n“Sky...”\nIt was then.\nKwang!\nAnother thing fell from the ceiling and entered the room through the same hole.\nThis time, it was much bigger, and the entire room was covered in dust.\n“What is it?”\n“Infiltrated?”\nSsrrng!\nPeople pulled out their weapons.\nWheeing!\nThen, the dust settled with a weird sound.\nA young man with a fair face and black coat.\nChun Yeowun.\n“Who dares to...”\nChun Yeowun looked down at the people and said.\n“Kneel.”\nAt that moment, the seniors in the room were forced to kneel against their wills.\nThud! Thud!\n“Kuak!”\n“What the hell is this!”\nEveryone couldn’t hide their shock at what was happening.\nWhat made them even more shocked was.\n\"Ch-chairman!!!”\nThe arrogant chairman was no exception.\n⁽¹⁾Mach 13 ≃ 16,000 km/h or 10,000 mph",

      "content": "The executives of the Yongchun group, who knelt down as they were suppressed by the Sky Demon energy, quickly grasped the situation.\nUnlike Huan Xia, a young member of the Ghost Illusion clan, they were all leaders of the higher clans in the Sky Demon Order even before it dissolved.\nNaturally, they had the ability to figure out the cause of what was happening.\n‘Demonic energy is trembling.’\n‘Demonic energy is going out of control.’\nThey instinctively recognized that the cause was Chun Yeowun.\nWoong!\n‘What the hell is this man’s...’\nThe demonic energy emanating from Chun Yeowun was different from the energy they possessed.\nIt was like the difference between a sea and a river.\n‘Was there ever a demonic energy that could force others to surrender?’\nThe demonic energy itself couldn’t be controlled.\nThose with demonic energy could weaken others.\nHowever, it was the first time that they felt it shuddering inside them.\nChun Yeowun, who glanced at them, opened his mouth.\n“This is good. Are you the people leading this faction?”\n‘This faction?’\nTheir eyes turned bitter.\nThey managed to understand two things.\nFirst, This person knew about them.\nAnd second, the man most probably belonged to another faction.\n“You were sitting on the top.”\nChun Yeowun’s gaze turned to the chairman as he spoke.\nChun Yeowun, who was standing on the table, approached him.\nIt was then.\n“Stop!”\nPapak!\n“Ho-oh?”\nChun Yeowun’s eyes shone.\nTwo people, who were on their knees, stood up.\nOne of them was director Huan Myong-ho, the current clan leader of the Ghost Illusion clan.\n[Suppress demonic energy...]\nAt director Huan’s message, the other people understood what he meant.\nIt has been nearly a thousand years since demonic energy got introduced to the Cult.\nAnd that thousand years was enough for them to wield it freely.\n‘If the demonic energy is being restrained...’\nThey just had to push it.\nAs Huan Myung-oh said, they began to suppress the demonic energy inside them, and the control over their body, which had been restrained, returned back to normal.\nPapak!\nBefore long, another three people, including the chairman, stood up.\nHowever, there were four more who were relatively weak in controlling their internal energy. That’s why they couldn’t stand up.\n“Pretty good.”\nChun Yeowun praised the five who got up.\nIt wasn’t that they overpowered him, but he liked how they responded calmly to the situation.\nHuan Myung-oh held the ghost sword tightly in his hand.\n“I am Huan Myung-oh, the clan leader of the Ghost Illusion clan. Are you a leader in our Cult?”\nHuan Myung-oh was convinced that Chun yeowun was a member of the Cult.\nAmong all the Murim people, only Cult members were able to deal with the demonic energy.\nBut they couldn’t figure out who the man was.\n‘That sword...’\nHuan Myung-oh’s gaze turned to the sword in the middle of the table.\nWho wouldn’t know that sword?\nThey weren’t sure if it was genuine, but it was very similar to the sword the Chun Woo-kyung faction had shown.\nAt that time, Chun Yeowun spoke.\n“For a descendant of Elder Huan, your tone is quite manly.”\n“Elder Huan?”\n“If it wasn’t for that face and the Ghost Sword, I wouldn’t have believed that you were a Ghost Illusion clan leader, but an ordinary member of the cult.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, Huan Myung-oh’s impression hardened.\nWithin the Cult, the only people who knew about his sword were the previous clan leaders of Ghost Illusion, the Lord, and the clan leaders of other higher clans.\n‘How did he know?’\nEven the chairman didn’t know that director Huan had a skin mask on.\nIt was natural.\nThe clan leaders of the Cult only revealed their swords and faces to the Lord.\nThe current chairman had ordered that those who support him should present themselves proudly to him.\nThat’s why Huan Myung-oh removed the mask, but in fact, it was a rare double masking.\n“Director Huan?”\nThe chairman looked at him as if asking if it was real, and Huan Myung-oh couldn’t hide his embarrassment.\nIt was a difficult situation.\nAt that moment, someone raised their sword towards Chun Yeowun.\n“I don’t know which clan you belong to, but don’t act up in front of our chairman!”\nHe was a swordsman with excellent swordsmanship skills.\nThe sword kept changing at various angles with the versatility of a snake.\nChachacha!\nPak!\n“Uh?”\nThe middle-aged man who unfolded the sword technique couldn’t hide his fluster.\nEven before the technique was entirely unfolded, Chun Yeowun grabbed the sword’s blade with just two fingers.\n“Seven Snake Sword of the Snake Sword Clan, but....There are a few changes.”\nKak!\nWhen Chun Yeowun applied energy, the blade broke.\n“Compared to Suh Deng, you are far behind. You must be ashamed to be the descendant of the 1st elder.”\n‘!?’\nThe man’s eyes fluttered.\nSuh Deng was the 6th ancestor and the great leader of his clan.\n“You will pay the price for swinging that sword at me.”\n“What?”\nPak!\nChun Yeowun flicked the broken blade with his finger.\nThe blade flew at a weird angle and pierced the left chest of the man.\n“Kuak!”\nWoong! Bang!\nIt wasn’t known how strong the attack was, but the middle-aged man crashed into the wall.\n“General Manager Suh!”\nThe members in the room were astonished.\nGeneral manager Suh was a Superior Master, one of the top three people.\nBut just now, he was easily taken down.\nAccording to the Murim Association, he must be top class.\n“You are from a different faction right?”\nThe only woman in the room, a middle-aged woman wearing a black skirt, aimed her unique-looking sword with a wire attached to it at Chun Yeowun.\nAs if playing an instrument, she flicked the wire with her fingers and extended the sword forwards.\n“This!”\nAt her act, everyone covered their ears.\nWooong!\nAt that moment, along with a deafening sound that vibrated the entire conference room, swords spread around as if water was spraying from a hose and covered Chun Yeowun.\n‘Waveform Sword!’\nIt was the Sound Clan’s unofficial Demon Sound Sword.\nIt was a technique that could only be unfolded when the person reached Superior Master level.\n‘You can’t stop this!’\nThe technique was more effective in narrow spaces.\nThe corners of her lips went up.\nHowever.\n“Indeed, must be from Sound Clan.”\nChun Yeowun lightly tapped his palm in the air.\nPang!\nRound ripples appeared in the air with a loud sound, and an invisible wall blocked all the swords.\n“No way! The clan’s...”\nWas blocked too easily.\nEven if the opponent was of Supreme Master level, he should have at least a five-step distance from the swords to stop them, but this man had just easily stopped them at such a narrow distance.\n“A combination of swords and sound waves... Quite useful. Sound Clan.”\nChun Yeowun was unexpectedly interested in the advanced techniques of the clan.\nEven since he became the Lord, the Sound clan had weakened a lot compared to the past.\nBut in the current times, martial arts seem to have become more advanced.\n“Sound clan seems to be doing better.”\n“What do you mean?”\nWheik!\nChun Yeowun reached out to her.\nThen suddenly, the woman grabbed her chest and began to scream.\n“Ackk!”\nIt wasn’t like applying pressure with internal energy.\nIt was a pain she was experiencing for the first time in her life. It felt as if someone was eating her heart away.\n“Achkkk!”\nShe couldn’t understand what was happening to her.\nEven if she didn’t move, her heart still hurt.\nDeciding that something was wrong with her body, she tried to raise her internal energy.\nThud!\n“Damn!”\nWhen she used her Dantian, the pain spread even more, and she couldn’t raise the internal energy.\nEven the slightest movement caused extreme pain in her body.\nIt felt like her body was being eaten alive.\n“Kuak!”\n“Manager Hang!”\nThe other people were worried.\nHer eyes were trembling in pain.\n‘Is my heart giving out?’\nAt first, she couldn’t understand why she was suddenly feeling pain.\nBut then, one thing came to her mind.\n‘Poison Parasite?’\nParasite poison.\nThat is the Poison Clan’s technique, a dangerous poison that becomes dormant in the host’s body.\nShe knew what it was.\nIt was a curse that was passed down in her family from generation to generation.\n‘No way...’\nShe, who kept holding her heart, looked at Chun Yeowun.\nShe heard that the poison in her body was dormant and that it was placed in her ancestor Hang Soyu, as a punishment from Chun Yeowun, the 24th Lord.\nThe Gu poison was created by the first Chun Ma and could only respond to the Sky Demon energy.\nIt was a poison that could only be controlled with Sky Demon energy.\n‘How can this be...’\nThe clan put a lot of effort into getting rid of the poison in their bodies.\nHowever, no matter how advanced the medical technology was, they couldn’t find a way to get rid of the poison that held onto the Dantian and heart.\nEventually, the clan gave up and lived normally as no descendant could control the Sky Demon energy.\n“W-who are you? How are you using Sky Demon energy?”\n“Sky Demon energy!”\nWoong!\nAt the words of Manager Hang, the others became confused.\nThey knew that the demonic energy the man used was different, but they never thought it could be the Sky Demon energy.\nBecause the Sky Demon energy wasn’t passed down after the 2nd Chun Ma.\n“So, you still don’t know who I am?”\nGoooo!\nBlack energy exploded from Chun Yeowun’s body.\nAll the people were shocked by the suffocating energy that was different from the energy he released the first time.\n‘H-how can this be...’\nThey knew it.\nThey were trying to suppress the demonic energy within them, but now, despite their trials to suppress it, it kept trembling.\nThey looked at the Sky Demon Sword that was on the table.\n‘Sky Demon Sword... Sky Demon energy!’\nIt symbolized only one thing.\nOne person knelt down.\nThud!\nIt was Huan Myung-oh.\nHuan Myung-oh, who knelt down, then banged his head on the floor three times and shouted.\nThud! Thud! Thud!\n“Huan Myung-oh, a lowly member of the Great Sky Demon Order, greets the Chun Ma!”\nAs soon as he said those words, almost everyone else bent down and shouted in unison.\n“We greet the Chun Ma!!!”\nThe absolute title of the Sky Demon Order.\nNo one could disobey the holder of the title of Chun Ma.\nHowever, one person didn’t bow.\nHe was the chairman of the Yongchun group.\n“No way! The Sky Demon energy has disappeared since the 24th Lord! What are the elders doing! You must only kneel to me!”\nThe chairman was so angry that veins started to pop up on his forehead.\nDespite his cry, not a single bowing person lifted their head.\n‘No way!’\nThese were the people who supported and followed him.\nHowever, they easily abandoned him because of a person who showed the power of Chun Ma.\nHe couldn’t believe it.\n“That Sky Demon Sword has to be fake, how can he have the sword that went missing along with the 24th Lord?”\nPhat!\nThe angry chairman rushed to attack Chun Yeowun.\n“Do not test my patience!”\nHe drew his sword and unfolded it.\nHe unfolded the 2nd form of the Sword Force of Sky Demon, which drew 24 splendid trajectories.\nThe Sword Force of Sky Demon, known to be the most perfect swordsmanship in the entire Murim, was unfolded in his hands.\nChow! Chow! Chow! Chow!\n‘oh oh oh!’\n‘Indeed!’\nAs they saw the sword being unfolded, all the people on the floor exclaimed.\nAmong the two sons of the previous chairman, the chairman’s swordsmanship was known to be excellent as he was the talented one.\nAnd only those who knew the technique would be able to block and defend themselves.\n‘I am going to reveal that you are fake!’\nThe chairman was too proud of himself.\nHe was confident that there was no one worthy of being his opponent.\nChun Yeowun clicked his tongue.\n“Since when did someone who isn’t even the Lord start being taught the Sword Force of Sky Demon?”\nTak!\nHe had no sword, yet he stopped a sword.\nBut what was more shocking.\n“There is no connection from the 8th to 9th change. And the 13th form is horrible.”\n“What?”\n“Here.”\nPak!\nChun Yeowun lightly pushed the right elbow.\nAnd the chairman’s technique form shook.\n‘Th-this!’\nPuck! Kuak!\n“Kuak!”\nChun Yeowun kicked the ankle.\nThe chairman felt his ankle break, and the sword fell.\nShhh!\nThe sword that was lost from his grip flew to the ceiling and pierced it.\nThud!\nAs his ankle got broken, the chairman fell down on the table.\nThe sword that was supposed to be the most perfect ended before he could even properly unfold it.\n‘H-how did this happen?’\nThe chairman looked at Chun Yeowun with a puzzled face.\nEven the Lord, who was currently imprisoned, never pointed out his mistakes in such a dangerous way.\nWith a trembling voice, he asked.\n“Who... who are you?”\nLeaning closer to him, Chun Yeowun looked him in the eye and asked.\n“Who am I? The 24th Lord. The one who disappeared.”\n‘!!!’\nAt the unexpected answer, the chairman’s eyes widened.\nTo him, Chun Yeowun spoke in a cold voice.\n“Did you think that you could turn the Cult into such a mess and get away with it?”",

      "content": "The missing 24th Lord, Demon God Chun Yeowun.\nMore than a thousand years have passed since he disappeared.\n‘Does this even make sense?’\nThe chairman’s eyes were wide and shaking.\nNowadays, the average human lifespan ranges from 90 to 120 years, thanks to the development of the medical field.\nAmong the Murim people who always worked on honing their skills, only eight registered Murim warriors had lived over 170.\nIt was an era in which longevity was possible, but it made no sense for a person to live a thousand years.\n‘No matter how I look...’\nThe man in front of him looked like he had just turned twenty.\nIt would have been impossible without having immortality.\nThat was when something struck his mind.\n‘The 24th ancestor, the Demon God, was said to be the only person who reached the Heavenly Master level in Murim.’\nThe last level, which was taught to be a myth, was reached.\nThe murim people believed that those who would reach that Heavenly Master level would become immortal and live an eternal life.\nIn a trembling voice, the chairman asked.\n“A-are you really the 24th Lord?”\n“I guess you weren’t listening to my words.”\nChun Yeowun’s cold words made goosebumps rise all over his body.\nIt would be better to say that his body shuddered.\n‘W-Who can this...’\nIf he was the Demon God he knew about, then that meant he was an actual ancestor.\nAfter reviving the Sky Demon Order, which was once swayed by the outsiders and re-establishing the Chun family, Chun Yeowun fought for his position and became the Lord.\n‘If he really is the 24th lord and ancestor, then I can’t be like this.’\n“Kuk!”\nThe chairman raised his upper body and then bowed his head to Chun Yeowun.\nAnd cried out in a loud voice.\n“I am Chun Yu-jang, 24th...”\nShh!\n“Ah?”\nEven before he could greet, chairman Chun Yu-jang’s body stood up on its own.\nChun Yeowun, who was looking at him with cold eyes, opened his mouth.\n“Everyone, raise your heads.”\n‘All?’\nThe others, who were bowing their heads, couldn’t understand why Chun Yeowun said that.\nBut, the order of the Chun Ma was absolute.\nCautiously, they lifted their heads and looked at Chun Yeowun.\n“You people are a huge disappointment.”\nIn straight words, all of them ended up lowering their heads at the same time and shouted.\n“We apologize!!!”\nThey couldn’t give an excuse.\nThey felt like they were kids in front of their parents, unable to hide the shame they were feeling.\nChun Yeowun spoke to them with a firm voice.\n“Apologize? Do you think that this matter will pass with just words? Today, you will be punished for ruining the Cult!”\n“Punished?”\nAt the word ‘punishment’, the clan leaders’ expressions distorted heavily.\nWhile they were puzzled, Chun Yeowun’s hand went to Chun Yu-jang’s left wrist.\n“You will be the first.”\n“An-ances...”\nChun Yu-jang nervously gulped.\nDirector Huan Myung-oh looked at him with worried eyes.\n‘Still, he is a direct descendant, and can be very use...’\nCrack!\n“Kuak!”\nA scream erupted from his mouth.\nAnd shock appeared in the eyes of the people who witnessed it.\nChun Yu-jang’s wrist fell to the floor.\n“C-chairman!”\n“Do you have to go this far!”\nThe others couldn’t hide their shock as they didn’t expect their arms to be cut off.\nNot caring about their reactions, Chun Yeowun spoke to Chun Yu-jang, who was in pain.\n“First! The punishment for messing up the Cult and causing all its members to scatter and hide!”\n“Kuak!”\nChun Yu-jang looked at Chun Yeowun with fearful eyes.\nHe was prepared to take some punishment, but he never thought his wrist would be cut off.\n“My Lord!”\nHuan Myung-oh stepped forward while kneeling and said.\n“This is too extreme. Even if that is true, the chairman is the leader of the faction, and a direct descendant!”\n“Huh.”\nChun Yeowun snorted and waved his hand.\nThe severed wrist of Chun Yu-jang, which fell to the floor, moved in front of Huan Myung-oh.\nPak!\nAs he saw it, Huan Myung-oh trembled.\nChun Yu-jang’s severed part was emitting a chill as if it had been put in a freezer.\n‘It is freezing. No way!’\nDuring the measures of rejoining an amputated body part, the cut parts were often wrapped in a handkerchief or gauze and placed in an ice pack.\nIt was to minimize the tissue damage.\nBesides.\n‘The cut section is clean.’\nIt looked like he cut it out of anger, but it was done with care.\nFor those who reached Chun Yeowun’s level, handling the sword to minimize damage was an easy task.\n‘He didn’t just cut it.’\nHe was literally delivering the punishment.\nIf Chun Yeowun had cut it in rage or anger, then rejoining it would be impossible.\nWhen Huan Myung-oh realized that he wasn’t hurting but punishing them, he had no choice but to keep his mouth shut.\n“An-ancesto...”\nChun Yu-jang, who didn’t know it, was losing his mind.\nBecause he made one mistake, his wrist was cut off.\nHe was afraid to think of a second or third mistake that could cost him his neck.\n/strong>\n“P-please forgive me.”\nChun Yu-jang said in a pleading voice.\n“Second! The punishment for disintegrating the Cult because of self-interest and greed for the Lord position when the entire Cult was in crisis.”\nPak!\n“Ugh!”\nChun Yu-jang’s eyes widened.\nThe place where Chun Yeowun’s palm was headed was none other than his Dantian.\nHe was even more flustered than when his arm was cut off.\n“An-ancestor! No... not this... please!”\n“Not what?”\nWoong!\nChun Yeowun grabbed the abdomen.\nInternal energy began to dig into Chun Yu-jang’s dantian.\n“Kuak!”\nLike a piece of paper, Chun Yu-jang’s face wrinkled.\nInstinctively, he tried to raise his internal energy to fight it off, but the difference between them was too great.\nChun Yeowun’s energy began to dig deep, causing pain all over the body.\n“Kuaaak!”\nFrom neck to forehead, veins were popping up. The people seeing it couldn’t hide the fear showing up on their faces.\n‘Is he trying to break the Dantian?’\nIf that is the case, then cutting off the arm was just the beginning.\n“Ancestor! Please! Please forgive me! Achhh!”\n“I will seal the dantian of the three bastards who ruined the Cult until all of them are gathered at one place.”\nWith those words, Chun Yeowun released his hand.\nThe painful burning fire in the body disappeared right away.\n“Huh.... Huh...”\n‘M-my internal energy?’\nChun Yu-jang’s face turned white.\nSealing his Dantian wasn’t a lie.\nThe internal energy inside his body didn’t move on his request.\n“Kuaak!”\nWith his arms cut off and his dantian sealed, his eyes reddened as he realised how miserable he was.\nWhat was even more unbearable was that it was happening in front of the clan leaders.\n‘Ahhh... how can you do this to your direct descendant?’\nThere was nothing more to lose.\nFor becoming the Lord of the Cult, he even broke apart from his own older brother.\nAnd when his only purpose in life was shattered like that, he lost his motivation.\nTo him, Chun Yeowun said.\n“Third one.”\n“Third?”\nNow Chun Yu-jang felt like crying.\nWhat more could be done after cutting his wrist and sealing his dantian?\nIt was then.\nBeep! Beep!\nThe office phone rang.\nNot only that, but the phones of all the people in the room started to ring.\n‘Hmm.’\nChun Yeowun was puzzled.\nHe made sure to cut off any interference in the room by covering it with energy, but still, something happened.\n‘Not the ones outside.’\nOutside the room, there were around two prominent people who seemed to be guards.\nAnd they didn’t come in when the ceiling was broken.\n‘Then...’\nChun Yeowun looked at the curtain in the room covering the scenery outside.\n“Answer it.”\n“Yes!”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, Huan Myung-oh answered the phone.\n“I am in a meeting right now.”\nHe intended to cut it off.\nHowever, Huan Myung-oh’s face was shocked.\nHe cut the call right away and hurried out to open the curtain that was covering the window.\nThe moment he opened the curtain, he saw several vehicles of the National Guard gathered at the entrance of the building.\n“Defense forces.”\n“Why are they here?”\nNo one could understand it.\nHuan Myung-oh spoke in a cautious voice as he looked at Chun yeowun and Chun Yu-jang.\n“It is Major Baek Jin-chang of the National Guard.”\n“Baek Jin-chang? Why is he here?”\n“It seems like an unidentified flying object fell on our building, and it has to be a gate related problem, so they requested us to cooperate with the search.”\nUpon hearing that it was an unidentified flying object, everyone’s eyes turned towards Chun Yeowun.\nHe was the only one who flew through the ceiling.\nAs he didn’t predict this to happen, Chun Yeowun rubbed his chin.\n‘Nano. Didn’t you fly in stealth mode?’\n[The infrared camera must have captured the heat rays emitted by the magnetic particles, the radar couldn’t see it.]\nThe radar could be blocked.\nHowever, the Gate Defense Forces had taken measures to prevent the approach of dangerous objects into the barrier. It was only natural that they detected the movement.\n‘Bothersome.’\nIt was when he looked out of the window and started to think about what to do.\nChun Yu-jang spoke.\n“Ancestor.”\n“What?”\n“If it is Baek Jin-chang of the National Guard, then I think I can do something about it.”\n“What can you do?”\n“He received a lot of donations from our Yongchun group.”\nThe Yongchun was able to be listed in Jinan city because it had built a strong relationship with the high-ranking officials.\nAfter looking at his eyes, Chun Yeowun released the internal energy suppressing the people.\n“T-thank you for trusting me. I-I will get this done soon.”\nChun Yu-jang, who managed to escape the third punishment because of the unexpected appearance of the National Guard, hurriedly left the room with Huan Myung-oh and others.\nChun Yu-jang’s mouth twitched as he headed to the elevator.\n‘Nice timing!’\nHe felt genuinely grateful for the appearance of the National Guard.",

      "content": "The entrance to the Yongchun group’s headquarters building was through the wide lake.\nA National Guard vehicle was encamped there, and more than fifty people of the National Guard were waiting in line at the closed entrance.\nIn front of them was a shot, a middle-aged man with pale eyebrows. He was Major Baek Jin-chang.\n“Major Baek. Do we really need to wait here? Let’s start the search right away.”\nSaid a bearded man, who was waiting with crossed arms.\n“Wait up. Don’t be impatient, captain Ha.”\nThe bearded man’s vest had the Gate Keepers pattern drawn on it.\nHe was Ha Hyun-gang, the Gate Keepers captain in Jinan city.\nUnable to understand, Ha Hyun-gang protested.\n“Don’t be impatient? An unidentified flying object fell here! If it has anything to do with the Gate, it would be a huge problem, right? I can’t quite understand why the Major is being so kind to the Yongchun group.”\nDispleased, Baek Jin-chang frowned.\nActually, as the captain said, they had the authority to forcibly conduct a search if there was a Gate-related problem.\nThe reason he didn’t resort to it was simple.\n‘The amount of money we receive from the Yongchun group is worth the wait.’\nThe search should be conducted as gently as possible so that he and the National Guard keep constantly receiving donations.\nHowever, it wasn’t something he could just say.\n“As you know, the Yongchun group are Murim warriors. If they discovered such a dangerous object, they would have reported. But look.”\nThe premises were quiet.\nIf a dangerous object had fallen, it would have been noisy.\n“Sigh.”\nHa Hyun-gang realised that it was useless to keep trying to persuade him.\nHe knew that the Yongchun group had considerable influence in Jinan, but it was a shame that even the National Guard was under them.\nIt was around 15 minutes after the search request was made.\nFrom the building’s side, Chairman Chun Yu-jang appeared with the executives and about forty men in uniforms that seemed to be like security guards,\n“Don’t you feel that something is wrong? Major Baek?”\n“... Stay silent.”\nBaek Jin-chang, who reprimanded the captain, approached them.\nAnd with a bright spike, he spoke to Chun Yu-jang.\n“Oh my! Chairman Yong Yu-chun. Sorry for bothering you late at night.”\nYong Yu-chun.\nA pseudonym.\nSince the official dissolution of the Black Sky Company, most of the clan leaders, including the Lord’s family, hid their true identities and used different names.\n“It is cumbersome. Hahaha. But you people work hard to guard the wall every day, why would a normal businessman be bothered by you?”\nThe two people exchanged light words.\n‘As expected of our chairman.’\nDirector Huan Myung-oh was happy to see Chun Yu-jang’s acting naturally.\nHe was anxious since the chairman’s wrist was cut and his Dantian was sealed, but the man acted as professionally as one could.\nBaek Jing-chang, who looked at the bandaged left arm with a puzzled look, commented.\n“You look like you were injured.”\n“Ah... It was a small accident.”\n“Is that so?”\n‘An accident?’\nBaek Jin-chang was confused.\nThe chairman of the Yongchun group was an unregistered Murim, but he knew that he possessed great martial arts.\nIn fact, he had seen the man in action several times in the war.\n“Anyway, I heard that you made a search request for an unidentified flying object.”\n“Hmmm, indeed. The National Defense Agency caught a flying object, but it disappeared at this site.”\nBaek Jin-chang spoke as if he was sorry about it.\nAs if saying that the search was inevitable.\n“Ahh, that makes sense. However.”\nAt that, Chun Yu-jang looked at Huan Myung-oh, who was next to him.\nDirector Huan Myung-oh nodded his head as he took out a tablet PC from his bag and showed it to Baek Jin-chang.\n“This?”\n“We received permission from the city hall security department to give our report by tomorrow mornng after our security team conducts a search of its own.”\nBaek Jin-chang frowned at that.\nAt the bottom of the email was indeed the mark of the Jinan City Hall and an electronic signature of the security department’s head.\n“Hmm.”\nHe actually wanted to do a rough search of the building because of their relationship and leave, but he felt something was up when they showed him that mail from city hall.\nAt that time, Ha Hyun-gang, the Gate Keepers captain, who was listening from the side, intervened.\n“Major Baek. Even if the City hall gave them permission, isn’t this a matter that the National Defense Agency has to check in person?”\nHearing that, Chun Yu-jang narrowed his eyes and said.\n“Isn’t the City Hall Security higher than the Defense? Captain Ha?”\n“That’s when it’s not a Gate-related issue. Chairman Yong.”\nTak!\nAs Ha Hyun-gang took a step forward, the twelve Gate Keepers behind him walked ahead.\nThey were showing that they would do it even by force.\n‘Cheeky bastard.’\nThe Yongchun group didn’t get along well with the Gate Keepers.\nChun Yu-jang, who was in a bad mood after being scolded by Chun Yeowun, didn’t accept their actions.\nChun Yu-jang raised his right hand.\nAnd the security guards behind him had their hands on their waist.\nShhh!\n“Ha! What does this mean!? Major Baek! The Yongchun group says that they are going to fight the National Guard now! Are we really going to head back?”\nBaek Jin-chang couldn’t help but be flustered at Ha Hyun-gang’s words.\n‘Damn it!’\nHe was literally in a dilemma.\nConsidering the city hall permission they’d received and his relationship with the Yongchun group, the right thing to do would be to give up the search and return.\nHowever, as Ha Hyun-gang said, all the authority rested in the National Guard’s hand if it was a Gate-related problem.\n‘I shouldn’t have brought the Gate Keepers.’\nIf the object was hostile, then the Gate Keepers were needed.\nThe Gate Keepers seemed to be ready to fight people if they had to.\nA confrontation was bound to happen.\nTak!\nAt that moment, someone got out of a Gate Keepers car and approached them.\nIt was a woman in her late twenties with shiny brown hair, a white shirt, a huge chest, and black pants tight enough to show her curves.\nThe Gate Keepers, including their captain, reacted strangely at the woman’s appearance.\n‘What now?’\nChun Yu-jang looked at her with puzzled eyes.\nHe had been in Jinan city for a long time, but it was his first time seeing her.\nShe spoke to the captain.\n“How long are you going to hold it off? Please quickly proceed with the search.”\nTo that, Ha Hyun-gang cautiously responded.\n“The Yongchun group said that they talked to the city hall security department and said that they would conduct their own searc...”\n“Since when did a single company have the authority to stop the searches of the defense and Gate Keepers? Do it now!”\n“Alright! Conduct the search!”\n“Yes!”\nAt her resolute command, the Gate Keepers tried to enter.\nSrrrn!\nThey were blocked by the security guards of the Yongchun group, who pulled out their weapons.\nAlthough they looked like normal guards, they were all first-rate warriors as they were members of the Sky Demon Order.\nChun Yu-jang shouted at the Gate Keepers who were about to enter the site.\n“I am sure that I told you we received the permission. If you ignore it, we will have to exercise our right to self-defense.”\n“Right to self-defense?”\nThe woman with brown hair stepped forward and reached out to the security guard.\nKuk!\nAt that moment, the guards blocking the entrance fell down to the floor.\nThey were speechless.\n“Ugh!”\n“M-my body...”\n“Heavy!”\nThe guards couldn’t even move.\nUnlike internal energy that would push them down, their bodies seemed to have turned heavy.\n‘Is that woman an A-class Gate Keeper?’\nDirector Huan Myung-oh tried to judge her abilities based on what he witnessed.\nHe looked around at the falling guards and moved to subdue the brown-haired woman at once.\nThud!\nHis ankles suddenly crashed into the floor as if something heavy was attached to them.\nHe was barely holding on.\n‘My body feels heavier.’\nHe knew that Gate Keepers had extraordinary abilities, but he had never experienced such strength before.\n‘Then...’\nGoo!\nHuan Myung-oh decided to unleash energy to block the power that was subduing him.\nAs expected, when he defended with internal energy, his body could move freely again.\n‘Yes!’\nHuan Myung-oh rushed to the woman.\n“You are pretty good, but...”\nShe reached down and then lowered her hand.\n“Uhk!”\nThud!\nUnlike the first time when his body turned heavy, Huan Myung-oh collapsed as if something huge was crushing him from above.\nThe ground around Huan Myung-ho hollowed out.\n“Uhhh!”\nHe tried to move, but it was impossible.\nThe more he tried to move, the stronger the pressing force got.\n‘I-I wasn’t mistaken. This is gravity...’\nThud!\nHuan Myung-oh’s face dug into the ground.\n“What is this?”\nChairman Chun Yu-jang couldn’t hide his shock.\nHe never imagined that director Huan, a Superior Master, could be so helpless.\nThen a Gate Keeper shouted with a confident voice.\n“As expected of an SS-class Gate Keeper!”\n“SS-class?”\nThe Yongchun people went stiff.\n‘SS-class!’\nThe highest level a Gate Keeper could ever be was S-class.\nHowever, among the S-class, there were very few who had amazing strength.\nTherefore, the government gave them a special class, the SS-class.\n“Why is there an SS-class here?”\nIt was Chun Yu-jang’s first time seeing a SS class.\nHa Hyun-gang, the captain, spoke to the chairman, who was flustered.\n“I guess you are out of luck. Chairman Yong. You are provoking the SS-class Keeper, Yu So-hwa the Gravity Witch.”\nThe brown-haired woman’s name was Yu So-hwa.\nAn SS-class keeper capable of handling gravity.\n“Stop spouting nonsense and start the search. Is Major Baek going to just stand there?”\n“Ah-I understand!”\nBaek Jin-chang answered in a shocked tone.\nIt seemed like he didn’t know her identity as well.\nThe SS-keepers were considered priority citizens and had the title of world colonels.\n‘I am sorry.’\nBaek jin-chang shook his head as he could never oppose her.\n“Everyone proceed with the search.”\n“Yes!”\nThe National Guard tried to enter the site by following the Gate Keepers.\nChun Yu-jang’s face contorted.\n‘Damn it!’\nThe search that should have been stopped was going to be conducted because of an SS-class Gate Keeper.\nIf his Dantian wasn’t sealed, he would have stood up and fought, but now, there was no one who could stop the monster.\n“Huhuhu.”\nThe Gate Keepers reached ahead of him.\nAnd while passing him, the captain laughed at Chun Yu-jang.\nIt was then.\n[Third. You are weak! Although you drew the sword because you wanted the position, you couldn’t rebuild the Cult and only made the members’ confusion grow.]\n‘!!!’\nPang!\nAs they were trying to enter the site, Ha Hyun-gang and the Gate Keepers were thrown back.\n“Ack!”\n“Ahh!”\nThud!\nThey collided with the National Guards behind them and fell down.\nThe SS-class Keeper Yu So-hwa’s eyes narrowed when she saw them fly back.\nAt that moment, someone appeared in front of Chun Yu-jang.\nIt was.\n“Ancestor!”\nChun Yeowun.\nAs Chun Yu-jang was surprised, Chun Yeowun spoke to him.\n“It is a sin to be weak.”",

      "content": "“Ouch!”\nHa Hyun-gang, the Gate Keepers captain, who was thrown out by an unknown force, looked at Chun Yeowun, who suddenly appeared in front of him.\n‘What was it?’\nAn unknown force suddenly blew them away.\nHe then realised that the unknown force was energy.\nIt was something entirely related to the Murim people, called internal energy.\n‘Murim?’\nHowever, this man seemed very different from the other Murim people he knew.\nHe was exuding an overwhelming sense of intimidation, which he felt only in Gate battles.\nThud!\nEven the other Gate Keepers took fighting stances as their eyes focused on one person.\n“Ancestor.”\nChairman Chun Yu-jang gazed at Chun Yeowun’s back.\nChun Yeowun didn’t turn and clicked his tongue while saying.\n“Tch, since when did the Cult start paying people? Since when did it start to get pushed aside by bizarre people who aren’t even warriors?”\nChun Yu-jang couldn’t think of an answer.\nRather, he felt terrible.\nIn the Black Sky Company’s old days, the Sky Demon Order dominated Murim and was untouched even by the government.\nChun Yu-jang wanted to bring back those days too.\n‘But. This isn’t the time where one great warrior can change everything.’\nThe words didn’t come out.\nIt was because he strongly sympathized with the saying, being weak is a sin.\nThat was when someone shouted.\n“Chairman Yong!”\nIt was Baek Jin-chang.\nHe was shouting with an angry face.\n“Didn’t we say that the search had to be done? Are you going against the National Guard!”\nIt was Baek Jin-chang’s last warning.\nActually, that last warning wasn’t necessary, but since he didn’t want the company funds to be halted, he tried to play it low.\n‘Please get out of our way. Please! The SS-class Gate Keeper isn’t from Jinan city nor is she someone that I can stop!’\nHe wanted to say it out loud, but he couldn’t.\nChun Yu-jang couldn’t hide his shock.\nDespite receiving permission from the city hall, it was overrun by the National Guard. That meant all the money they kept giving to create contacts was all for nothing.\nThe SS-class Keeper, Yu So-hwa, spoke to Baek Jin-chang, who was giving warnings.\n“Major.”\n“Y-yes?”\n“They have already interfered with the execution of official duties. Arrest them!”\nShut!\nBaek Jin-chang shut his mouth at her resolute command.\nIt seemed like leading a conversation was impossible.\nBesides, since the Yongchun Group was made of Murim warriors, they wouldn’t easily let themselves get arrested.\nPak!\nBaek Jin-chang raised his hand and shouted.\n“Squad 1 and 2. Get Ready to fire!”\n“Ready to fire!”\nAt his command, 20 National Guards took out their guns and aimed them all at Chun Yeowun, Chun Yu-jang, and the fallen company guards.\n“Chairman Yong. Please don’t resist. If you move even a little, we will shoot...”\nTak!\n‘!?’\nChun Yeowun took a step ahead before he could even finish speaking.\n‘Shit!’\nNow there was nothing else he could do.\nIt was because he had already warned them, and Yu So-hwa was standing right beside him.\nBaek Jin-chang, who had to save his face, shouted.\n“Fire!”\nAs soon as the command fell, all the 20 soldiers pulled the trigger at once.\nTatatatak!\nLight flashed from the muzzles as the bullets were fired.\nThe soldiers’ expressions began to change as they shot at Chun Yeowun.\n‘What is this?’\nEvery time they fired, it felt like they were seeing dots.\nConfused, the soldiers stopped shooting, only to be shocked at what they were seeing.\n“W-what the hell is this?”\n“Bullets?”\nSurprisingly, the bullets didn’t travel more than 3 meters and were suspended in mid-air.\nIt was as if an unseen wall had stopped them.\nThe bullets were spinning mid-air, and all the officers couldn’t help but be flustered.\n“How can this be?”\nChun Yeowun answered them.\n“Go back.”\nChun Yeowun waved his hand lightly.\nThe bullets, floating mid-air, turned back.\n“Eik!”\n“A-avoid!”\nHowever, as the distance was short, the soldiers couldn’t escape.\nIt was then.\nPapapak!\nBullets that had to fly back to their owners, got stuck to the ground.\nShocked, the soldiers fell back and looked at the scene with startled eyes.\n“Ho-oh.”\nChun Yeowun’s eyes shone.\nThe one who blocked the bullet was none other than the SS-Keeper.\nThe one called Gravity Witch, she dropped the bullets to the floor with the force of gravity.\n“Soldiers fall back. This isn’t a place where normal people can step in.”\n“Y-yes!”\nShe asked Baek Jin-chang to call back the soldiers and spoke to Ha Hyun-gang, the Gate Keepers’ captain.\n“Force him down.”\nThe Gate Keepers were bewildered at her order.\nEveryone witnessed what had just happened. Hundreds of bullets stopped in mid-air.\nThey knew that fighting that monster wouldn’t be an easy task.\nOne of them, a B-class Keeper with a Murim background, spoke.\n“Uhm, at that level. That warrior could be above the Tiger level. It isn’t something that B and C-class Keepers can fight.”\nTiger Level.\nA level based on the zodiac calendar.\nThe Murim Association graded Murim people according to their internal energy and skills. The other organisations graded them according to the levels of zodiac deities.\nIt was the standard used in the current times.\nThe higher one went, the fewer the number of warriors would be.\nAnd according to the association, there was currently no Rat level (Divine Master level) warrior in the world.\nHowever, there was a rumor that the Chairman of the Murim Association, one of the five great warriors of the current Murim, has risen to that level.\nOf course, it hasn’t been officially confirmed.\n‘An S-class Keeper can only face a Rabbit face.’\nOne of the Gate Keepers was a B-class and a Super master level in Murim.\nHe was the leader of a Gate Keeper Platoon, but even he didn’t want to deal with a monster who could stop bullets.\n“These Murim people!”\nHa Hyun-gang shook his head.\nHe hated how murim people had a habit of figuring out the opponent’s skills before fighting.\nAnd if they deem the opponent superior, they don’t think it is necessary to fight.\n“Get out you cowards.”\n“Cap-captain!”\n“I don’t want to hear it. Face the enemy with the alpha class formation.”\n“Roger!”\nThe Alpha class formation.\nIt was a formation made to deal with alpha class entities.\nA-class or higher Keepers could deal with the Alphas by themselves depending on the hazard level, but it was difficult to deal with Alphas over B-class or higher.\n“Formation B!”\nAt the signal, the Keepers, accustomed to the formation, immediately moved and ran towards Chun Yeowun from different directions.\nAs members of the same team, they were all trained to disperse right away.\n‘With this formation, we can even take down an A-class Alpha! No matter how good you are, you are nothing in front of an A-class Alpha!’\nSrrng!\nHa Hyun-gang pulled out two swords from his waist.\nHe jumped a couple of times.\nShhh!\nHis figure vanished as he stepped into the air.\nAs an A-class Gate Keeper, he had the ability of invisibility and instant acceleration.\n‘This is quite annoying.’\nAs he saw him vanish, Chun Yu-jang frowned.\nSince they were in the same city, he saw the man use the ability a few times.\nBeing invisible wasn’t the problem.\n“Be careful! Ancestor! When the man disappears, his energy cannot be traced!”\nFrom his shadow to his breathing, everything got completely erased.\nIt was something which would normally be impossible to do, but these Gate Keepers had such problematic abilities.\nDealing with them was never easy.\n‘Even if we attack from all directions, that guy has the ability to avoid it.’\nInstant acceleration ability that could be compared to a Superior Master level warrior’s.\nBesides, the synergy between invisibility and acceleration was the best.\nIf one wasn’t careful, they could get knives stuck in their body.\n“You shouldn’t stand still! You need to keep moving so that he doesn’t get too close to you!”\nChun Yu-jang kept informing Chun Yeowun.\nShhh!\n‘Ha! Late!’\nHa Hyun-gang smiled.\nHe was invisible and was already behind Chun Yeowun.\nTatak!\nBesides, the Keepers who entered the formation tried to attack him.\n‘Now!’\nHa Hyun-gang was already aiming his knife at Chun Yeowun’s back.\nIt was then.\n“These bugs are bothersome.”\nChun Yeowun turned his palm and lowered it.\nAnd.\nThud! Thud! Thud!\n“Euk!”\n“M-my...B-body!”\nEven before they could show their abilities, the Keepers fell on their knees, being painfully suppressed.\nChun Yeowun had the ability to make even Supreme Masters immobile.\nGoooo!\nAs Chun Yeowun increased his energy, the people with mind-related abilities fell down as well.\nThud! Crack!\n“EUkkk!”\n“S-save!”\nAs they were pressed hard against the ground, they could feel their bones breaking.\nChun Yeowun didn’t even bother when they started to scream their lungs out.\nAt that time, Chun Yeowun pretended to grab something with his left hand.\nIt was then,\nWooon!\nBlood suddenly came out from the air.\nNot only blood but also flesh scattered all over the place.\nA gruesome spectacle that made a chill run down the spines.\n‘N-No way!’\nThe Keepers’ eyes went wide as they struggled on the ground.\n‘!!!’\nThere was something crumbled up like a ball on the floor.\nA mixture of flesh, blood and what seemed to be the remains of Ha Hyun-gang’s clothes.\n“You must have thought that since you couldn’t be seen, you couldn’t be found.”\nChun Yeowun shook his head.\nThe floor was soaked with the blood of the dead Ha Hyun-gang.\n‘A-amazing!’\nChun Yu-jang couldn’t help but feel amazed.\nAgainst Chun yeowun, the overpowered invisibility turned useless.\n“Monster....! He is a monster!”\nThe Gate Keepers, who acknowledged the B-class Keeper’s words, shouted.\nHowever, it was too late.\n“Now it’s your time.”\nChun Yeowun raised the energy even more.\nIt was then.\nThud!\nThe ground under Chun Yeowun’s feet cracked.\nIt was like something tremendous was crushing down on him.\n“You! You are a dangerous person.”\nFinally, the SS-class Gate Keeper, Yu So-hwa the Gravity Witch, made her move.\nRealizing that the other Keepers could do nothing, she decided to take the lead.\n‘If he is higher than the beginning of the Supreme Master Level, I have to get serious.’\nThe force of gravity she applied now was incomparable to the one she used to subdue Huan Myung-oh.\n“If you don’t want to die, surrender.”\nYu So-hwa looked at Chun Yeowun with arrogant eyes.\nShe intended to crush and kill Chun Yeowun if he didn’t yield.\n“Do you think that you will be able to withstand a stronger force?”\nShe reached out and pushed further.\nAnd.\nThud!\nThe ground sank more than 1 meter deeper.\nThe exerted force was doubled.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun still didn’t kneel.\n‘More... more!’\nShe started increasing it more.\nAt that moment, something unbelievable happened.\nTak!\n‘!?’\nChun Yeowun took a step ahead.\nWith a straight back and straight knees, he seemed to be totally unaffected by the gravity.\nTak!\nHe continued to walk.\nToo casually.\n“So what is gravity?”\n‘No way. How is he unaffected?’\nThe poker face she kept wearing, shook.\nIf an Alpha entity was to be put under that kind of pressure, they would’ve been crushed.\nAs confusion started to appear on her face, Chun Yeowun said.\n“On your knees.”\n“What...”\nIt was then.\nThud!\n“Kuak!”\nHer knees crushed onto the floor.",

      "content": "‘I...I am on my knees?’\nYu So-hwa’s eyes widened.\nThe humiliation was much greater than the pain.\nAfter becoming an SS-class Gate Keeper and earning the title of Gravity Witch, she believed that no person could ever stand in front of her.\nBut this man had just made her kneel.\n“It is an interesting ability, but you will have to pay the price for your actions.”\nChun Yeowun reached out to her.\nAt that time, Yu So-hwa, who was on her knees, bowed her head and said,\n“... I was at fault.”\n“Fault?”\n“I don’t need to conserve my power anymore because you... You aren’t human.”\nPak!\nWith those words, she stretched out her arms to the side.\n‘Huh?’\nChun Yeowun felt something he had never experienced before.\nHe felt no weight on his body.\nHis feet rose from the ground.\n“Hmm?”\n“Woah!”\nIt wasn’t just Chun Yeowun.\nNot only him, but everyone around him was floating.\nAnything on the ground within a 300-meter radius floated in the air, as if the place had fallen into a state of weightlessness.\nWoong!\n“C-car too!”\nThe soldiers of the National Guard were confused as they looked at the floating cars.\n‘I knew that it wasn’t easy to take her down.’\nChun Yu-jang, who was also floating in the air, frowned as he looked at Yu So-hwa.\nShe was an SS-class Gate Keeper.\nThe confrontation had to be explosive, like the one between two superhumans.\n‘Ancestor!’\nHe knew Chun Yeowun’s strength, but he was worried.\nContrary to his concerns, Chun Yeowun seemed to be interested.\nHe was curious about this phenomenon he had never experienced before.\n“This is fun.”\n“Don’t think that I earned the Gravity Witch title just with the ability of increasing the gravity.”\n“So what...”\nBefore he could finish his words, Yu So-hwa reached out to Chun Yeowun.\nShhh!\nThat was the moment.\nChun Yeowun’s body soared into the air.\nIn an instant, his body rose to around 200 meters off the ground.\nWith a smile on her face, she mumbled.\n“In zero gravity, I am the only one who can control your movements. From now on, there is nothing you can do in this space.”\nGravity Field.\nHer secret ability to control all gravity within 300-meter radius.\nHer brain activity was so great that she could use it for 5 minutes straight, and during that time, all gravity in that field was under her control.\n[A strong gravitational force is in the sky.]\n‘I know.’\nChun Yeowun responded to Nano’s warning.\nHe thought that she could only exert her power on the ground, but she seemed able to manipulate gravity anywhere.\n‘Hmm.’\nWhat was more annoying was that the gravity around him was blocking the energy.\n‘I need to deal with her soon.’\nPhat!\nChun Yeowun kicked the air around and tried to move towards the woman.\nWheik!\nAt that moment, his body was swept to the left.\nThe position of the field seemed to have changed.\n‘So tricky.’\nWhile his body was being swept away, Chun Yeowun sprinted in the air again using energy and tried to move in the opposite direction.\nHe then tried to move at greater speed.\nThe gravity wasn’t fixed, but constantly changing, which interfered with Chun Yeowun’s movements.\n‘You think I’ll let you adapt?’\nYu So-hwa changed the gravitational field around Chun Yeowun.\nThanks to that, Chun Yeowun’s body kept moving around, unable to move in a certain direction.\nShhh! Shh!\nDue to that, Chun Yeowun was in a situation where it was harder to move.\nWooo!\nChun Yeowun raised sword qi in his hand.\nAs his body was being swept away, he thought of something else.\n“Then this one.”\nChak!\nChun Yeowun directed the sword qi at Yu So-hwa.\nAt that moment, the sword qi, which seemed to fly in a straight line, bent and flew away.\n‘The path of the sword qi was changed?’\nHe only tried it out of curiosity, but it was a shock.\nHe didn’t know that gravity could affect that too.\nIt was then.\nSwoosh!\nAn RV flew towards Chun Yeowun.\n[Another gravitation field was formed in the vicinity of the user.]\nHe was being pushed to the left as the RV came for him.\n“You are really annoying.”\nChun Yeowun waved his hand at the incoming RV.\nChh!\nWith a sharp sound, the RV was split in half.\nBut the split RV still came for Chun Yeowun.\n‘How!’\nPang!\nChun Yeowun sprinted into the air and avoided it.\nAt that, the woman on the ground laughed.\n“You think you can avoid it so easily?”\nThe RV car turned and flew towards Chun Yeowun again.\n“Ha?”\nChun Yeowun was shocked.\nPhut!\nAgain, Chun Yeowun sprinted through the air and avoided the split RV.\nBut there was a problem.\n‘This...’\nThere wasn’t just one RV in the air.\nSix RVs flew in the direction of Chun Yeowun to crush him.\nBesides.\n[The gravitational field has changed.]\nAs soon as he tried to get away, the field position would change, making it impossible to move.\n“Oohh!”\n“T-this is an SS-class Gate Keeper!”\nThe National Guards and the wounded Gate Keepers cheered.\nThe gravitational field kept changing at one individual’s will.\nThis woman seemed capable enough to stand on top of the Gate Keepers.\n“I will crush you to death!”\nShe smiled.\nNo matter how much the cars were split and damaged, they would always go for Chun Yeowun.\n“An-ancestor!”\nBewildered, Chun Yu-jang shouted.\nIt was then.\nWooong!\n“What?”\nThe moment the RV cars were about to crush Chun Yeowun, the entire space rumbled.\nIt looked as if the space itself was warped.\nDudududk!\nThe RVs suddenly shattered.\nBang!\nThe destroyed RVs left no debris as they turned into dust.\n“W-what just happened?”\nYu So-hwa couldn’t understand it.\nIf her eyes weren’t playing tricks on her, then space seemed to be twisted for a second.\nUnable to withstand the pressure, the RVs were destroyed.\nIt was an embarrassing moment for her.\nGoooo!\n“Eukkk!”\nThud! Thud! Thud!\nEverything that was floating in the air, suddenly fell down.\nThe floating people crushed into the floor as if a force was exerted on them.\n“Ack!\nThud!\nThe Gravity Witch Yu So-hwa was no exception.\nHer own gravity had shockingly disappeared, and she was forced to kneel again.\nTerrified, she looked around.\nAt first, she thought she had lost her control over gravity, but that wasn’t the case.\n‘N-No way! Is he weighing down on the entire gravity field itself?’\nShe had an ability beyond human comprehension, but the power she was feeling right now seemed absurd.\nShe never once dreamed that such a thing could happen. Instead of trying to escape the gravity field, he crushed it.\n‘Is he even human?’\nEven an A-class alpha entity wouldn’t be able to do such things.\nThe man had to be an S-class or a special hazard entity.\nTak!\nChun Yeowun descended to the ground.\nLooking at the terrified woman, he said.\n“You are pretty good. You made use of nature’s energy.”\nNature’s energy.\nChun Yeowun, who reached the Heavenly Master level, could understand the flow of energy in nature.\nWhen one had reached Divine Master level, one would attain the highest state of an enhanced human body, and the Heavenly master level would allow one to handle nature’s energy.\nThe 300-meter radius gravity field was a result of controlling nature’s energy.\n‘I didn’t think that I would have to use nature’s energy.’\nChun Yeowun had never used more than 20% of his abilities against anyone except Blade God.\nBut for the first time, he dealt with nature’s energy.\nChun Yeowun sincerely acknowledged the woman.\n‘Even a Supreme Master wouldn’t be able to stand as this woman’s opponent.’\nEven if they used sword qi, the woman could freely change the gravity field, and the attack would never reach her.\nIt would be possible for a Divine Master to deal with her using invisible swords.\nThis was how annoying Yu So-hwa’s gravity field was.\nTak!\nChun Yeowun approached her.\n“M-monster!”\nHaving completely lost her will to his overwhelming abilities, she tried to move back.\nHowever, being suppressed, she couldn’t move.\nWith every step Chun yeowun took, she felt fear rise inside of her.\n“D-don’t come!”\nShe tried to use gravity once again.\nChun Yeowun swung his sword at her.\nChak!\n“Kuaaak!”\nThe right arm of the woman, who was trying to control gravity, was cut.\nShe cried as blood gushed out of her mouth.\nEven though such a beautiful woman was suffering in pain, Chun Yeowun didn’t blink and kept his cold look.\n‘H-he! He isn’t human!’\nEvery person, who was watching that, was speechless.\nGrab!\n“Achhh!”\nChun Yeowun grabbed her by the neck.\nLooking at Chun Yeowun, who seemed to have grown colder, she couldn’t utter anything.\nNo words could leave her mouth.\nUntil Chun Yeowun said.\n“I was going to kill you, but I changed my mind.”\n‘!?’\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun’s fingers pierced her neck.\nAs an SS-class Keeper, she had excellent abilities and could feel an unknown material coming into her body.\n“W-what did you put in my body!?”\nAs she started to lose her mind, Chun Yeowun spoke with a smile.\n“Something to turn you into a useful dog.”\n‘!!!’\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, Yu So-hwa’s face turned white.",

      "content": "The following day, Jinan City Defense Bureau.\nAll the highest positions in Jinan City were gathered in the Defense Bureau headquarters.\nGeneral Jo Yoon, the Commander-in-chief of the National Defense Bureau, frowned as he looked at the report from the previous night.\nSigh!\nThe military used paper reports for quick disposal at any time.\nHaving carefully looked through the reports, General Jo Yoon asked Baek Jin-chang, who was standing in front of his desk.\n“Major.”\n“Yes!”\n“The unidentified flying object that flew over the city last night was a hazard entity equivalent to A-class?”\n“Yes!”\nBaek Jin-chang responded.\nBut nervousness was apparent in his eyes.\nBecause 90% of the report that he wrote consisted of false facts.\n“According to the report, it was too fast to be captured and its size was quite small.”\nBaek Jin-chang stuttered a little as he spoke in response to the General.\n“Y-yes sir! In collaboration with the security guards of the Yongchun group, we confirmed the object to be a human-like sized entity.”\n“That’s why you wrote that it was a special entity in the report?”\n“Yes sir!”\n“A-class Gate Keeper Ha Hyun-gang died. 10 others were seriously injured. 7 Defense soldiers were injured and even an SS-class keeper Yu So-hwa suffered from serious injuries.”\nGeneral Jo Yoon stroked his head as he looked at the report.\nIf it was a special entity or an A-class entity with flying ability, then this much damage was understandable.\nRather, he thought that this damage was rather fortunate.\n“We were lucky. Major Baek!”\n“Ah... yes”\n“If it wasn’t for the Murim people in the Yongchun group and the SS-class Keeper, the damage would have been bigger.”\nBaek Jin-chang sighed in relief.\nHe was worried that the Commander-in-chief, Jo Yoon, might be suspicious, but fortunately, he seemed to have believed the report.\n“It is unfortunate! If Yu So-hwa hadn’t completely destroyed the entity’s body, you could have done something to contribute.”\n“Not at all! I did my duty and oversaw the situation.”\n“Hmm. That is a good attitude.”\nGeneral Jo Yoon praised him.\n‘Sigh...’\nBaek Jin-chang sighed inwardly.\nIt seemed like the General was going in the wanted direction.\nUnable to overcome the fear, he wrote the report as the Yongchun group had requested, but if a small loophole was found, his entire career would be disrupted.\n“I have a meeting, so let’s head back to our duties.”\n“Yes!”\nChak!\nBaek Jin-chang saluted him and then tried to head back.\nWhen the General called him.\n“Wait!”\n“Yes?”\nBewildered, Baek Jin-chang stopped walking and turned around.\nGeneral Jo Yoon said.\n“The Yongchun group said that one important building was blown up and the damage was great.”\n“Ah, I see.”\nBaek Jin-chang frowned.\n‘Damn it. I thought I was caught.’\nManipulating the reports was something he never wanted to do again.\n‘I did everything I could. I no longer want to be associated with that Group or that monster.’\nHe didn’t even want their donations anymore.\nAround two o’clock in the afternoon.\nThe Yongchun Group president’s office, Jinan city.\n“Yes yes. I am glad that it all worked out. Yes.”\nThe middle-aged man hung up the phone with a happy face.\nHis name was Bi Mak-heon.\nHe was the leader of the swordsman class and the general manager of the Yongchun group.\nBi Mak-heon hung up the call and reported to the middle-aged man sitting across from him.\n/strong>\n“I contacted Baek Jin-chang and he did a good job. The Defense department said they would provide compensation for the destroyed factory.”\n“Ah-great. You did well. General manager Bi.”\n“Yes. Chairman.”\nThe middle-aged man was Chun Yu-jang, the chairman of the Yongchun group.\nA young man in a black suit was standing near the window behind him.\nIt was Chun Yeowun.\nChun Yeowun’s gaze was directed towards the ruined factory site.\nThe building, which had been fine till last night, was deliberately exploded.\nThe idea was General manager Bi Mak-heon’s.\nHe boldly asked Chun Yeowun to resolve the situation, saying that the National Guards would make a big deal otherwise.\n‘He is bold.’\nDespite his overall ignorance of the current world, Chun Yeowun knew that sacrificing a factory would severely damage the company’s profits.\nDespite that, Bi Mak-heon asked to blow up the factory to calm the doubts.\nIt wasn’t a significant loss as it prevented the National Guards’ interference.\nIn addition, since the Defense Bureau had promised compensation for the destroyed factory, the actual damage would be reduced.\nChun Yeowun turned around and said.\n“You are quite useful.”\n‘Ahhh!’\nBi Mak-heon, whose expression was tense, smiled brightly.\nHis lips were twitching to form a smile.\nSince he had very little say in his position, he usually took the role of executing the decisions taken at the executive meetings.\n“T-thank you. It was all because Lord Chun Ma had trusted me.”\nThe chairman or the other executives would have never listened to him.\nWho would accept the idea of blowing up a factory?\nHowever, Chun Yeowun gave him a chance.\n“Chun Yu-jang.”\n“Yes, ancestor.”\n“To use this one as a general manager, your eyes must’ve been wronging you.”\n“Huh?”\n“Use him accordingly.”\nIn other words, it sounded like Chun Yeowun was asking the man to be promoted.\nBi Mak-heon couldn’t hide his surprise at those words.\nHe only stepped forward once and resolved one matter, but Chun Yeowun valued him too highly.\n‘He won the favor of my ancestor. So lucky.’\n“Understood. We will deal with it at the next board meeting.”\nChun Yu-jang accepted Chun Yeowun’s wishes.\nAs a result, Bi Mak-heon’s promotion was guaranteed.\n‘Such a tremendous person!’\nBeing too happy, BI Mak-heon immediately knelt on the floor and shouted.\n“I will live up to your expectations!”\nChun Yeowun was someone who valued skilled people.\nAnd it was Bi Mak-heon’s luck that helped him show his abilities at the right moment.\nBebebeep!\nIt was then, the phone in the chairman’s office rang.\nAfter answering the call, Chun Yu-jang nodded and hung up.\n“Ancestor. It is ready. Let’s head to the conference room.”\nYongchun Group’s headquarters building, 28th floor, conference room.\nMany people in suits were crowded inside that room.\nThey were the shareholders of the Yongchun group. Heads of offices, directors and affiliates’ presidents.\nNaturally, most shareholders were members of the higher clans of the Sky Demon Order.\n“Do you know why the meeting was held today?”\n“No. I heard about this for the first time today.”\n“Does Mr. Geum know?”\n“Well. It is surprising that a general meeting of shareholders was held so suddenly.”\nAll the gathered shareholders were puzzled.\nSince a Gate warning would be issued in Jinan city, calling for a general meeting was totally unexpected.\n‘What is happening?’\nLim Kang, the managing director of the affiliate, Yongchun Trading, closely watched the others.\nUsually, if a shareholders meeting was held, the agenda would be told, but most people were unaware of it this time.\n‘Is it because of... Sky Demon Sword?’\nThe Sky Demon Sword, shown by the Chun Woo-kang faction four days ago, was still something only higher officials knew about.\n‘I was worried that the shareholders meeting would be canceled, but it somehow worked out.’\nLim Kang saw this meeting as a good opportunity.\nHe was trying to reveal that Chun Woo-kang had the Sky Demon Sword at this meeting.\n‘If only I can unite them into that faction with this sacrifice!’\nRight.\nLim Kang was a member of the Chun Woo-kyung faction.\nAs the clan leader of a small clan, he has been active in affiliates of Yongchun Group for a long time, and kept sending information about this company to Chun Woo-kyung.\n‘This place would turn into an empty grave.’\nHe was resolute to do it.\nIn Lim Kang’s eyes, something strange was seen.\n“The chairman is here. All shareholders stand up.”\nWhoop!\nWith the secretary’s announcement, the door opened, and Chairman Chun Yu-jang, accompanied by the senior executives, entered the room.\nAll the shareholders stood up.\n‘Huh?’\n‘Cast?’\nShareholders were puzzled at the appearance of chairman Chun Yu-jang wearing a cast.\nIt was the first time since the establishment of the Group that Chun Yu-jang was injured.\nEven during the Gate Warning, the chairman Chun Yu-jang never suffered any injuries as the other executives protected him in times of crisis.\nHowever, there was something even weirder.\n‘Who is that person?’\nThere was a young man in a black suit walking beside Chun Yu-jang.\nNo, he was walking a step ahead, and the chairman even politely gestured at him.\n‘But, that seat?’\n‘Ah, maybe...’\nThere were two higher seats in the room where the chairman was supposed to sit.\nAnd as they were watching, the chairman sat beside the young man.\n‘What?’\n‘Who is that person sitting next to the chairman?’\nWhisper!\nThe shareholders mumbled amongst themselves, making the room turn noisy.\nAt that time, director Huan Myung-oh, who was in charge of the meeting, put the microphone near his lips and said.\n“Please take a seat.”\nAt once, the noise died down.\nAll the eyes were fixed on the young man sitting next to the chairman.\nThe young man with a white face and sharp-looking eyes seemed to be in his twenties.\n‘Who is he?’\n‘Someone close to the chairman?’\nThe shareholders that were supporting Chun Yu-jang as the next head were feeling uncomfortable.\nAt that time, Shim Young, the president of Yongchun Electronics, the largest affiliate, got up from his seat and bowed to the chairman.\n“Please forgive my rudeness! I am going to sound a little disrespectful to the chairman. Even though we were gathered here because this was a shareholders meeting with an undisclosed agenda, we would like to know who the person sitting next to the chairman is?”\nHearing that, the other shareholders nodded.\nDirector Huan said.\n“Even if you didn’t ask, we were going to tell this right away. Today the meeting wasn’t held with an agenda as it was only held to inform the shareholders of three important matters decided by the board of directors.”\nWhisper!\nAgain, noise broke out.\nUsually, the decisions made at the board meeting were notified through the company’s computer network rather than holding a meeting for it.\n“The first thing.”\nEveryone focused on Huan Myung-oh.\nWhen he got all the attention, he pointed to the young man in the black suit.\n“This young man is the vice-chairman who was chosen at the board meeting.”\n“Vice-chairman?”\nAll the shareholders were puzzled.\nA young man whose face they never saw was suddenly appointed as the vice-chairman.\nIndeed it was too sudden of a decision.\n‘This is fun.’\nLim Kang, who heard it, smiled.\nTo his knowledge, Huan Myung-oh was the top candidate for that position. Besides, some circulating rumors stated that Shim Young of the electronics affiliate would be the new senior executive.\nWhoop!\nAt that, Shim Young’s expression was distorted.\nThis meant that his opportunity to be a leader of the Chun Yu-jang faction was pushed aside.\n‘This is a good opportunity.’\nShim Young was an upper clan member of the Sky Demon Order.\nEven the other clans acknowledged how excellent his clan was.\nPeople knew that there were a lot of small and medium clans who followed him, but if the news about Sky Demon Sword came out, those clans would surely abandon him.\nPak!\nUnsurprisingly, with a face full of anger, Shim Young got up.\nBiting his teeth, he said.\n“Even if it was a board meeting, isn’t this too sudden? And a young man!”\nShim Young said while pointing to the young man next to the chairman.\n“A young one we have never seen is now the vice? There are a lot of seniors who made huge contributions, so I can’t quite understand this decision.”\nHe turned around and complained.\n“That...”\nShh!\nDirector Huan was about to answer, but the young man raised his hand and stopped it.\nHuan Myung-oh went silent as the young man took command.\n‘!?’\nConfusion appeared clear on all the shareholders’ faces.\nIt was their first time seeing Huan Myung-oh, the real working head of the Group, taking commands.\nAt that time, the young man who was appointed the vice-chairman looked at Shim Young and said,\n“It is the nominated vice-chairman.”\n“Nominated?”\nShim Young was confused.\nHe had lost it completely as his dream was pushed away in front of his eyes.\n“What nonsense is...”\n“Sit.”\nThud!\n“Uhk!”\nShim Young sat down at once.\n“W-what is this...”\nShim Young, who was forcibly seated in his chair, was flustered.\nHe couldn’t understand what had just happened.\nThe others were equally astonished.\n‘Did president Shim just follow the order of that vice chairman?’\n‘Why did he sit?’\nExcept for the senior executives, no one could understand what had just happened.\nShim Young got angry and was about to get up once again when the man said.\n“I don’t warn twice.”\nCreepy!\nThe moment he heard that, Shim Young’s face turned pale.\nHe himself didn’t know why.\nBut fear overwhelmed him.\n“W-who are you?”\nShim Young asked in a trembling voice.\nThe young man got up and stretched out his right arm.\nAnd.\nChachachacha!\nThe hidden black wrist guard on his hand suddenly turned into a sword.\nEveryone’s attention was focused on the black sword.\nDu Mun-cheon, one of the presidents of affiliates, shouted.\n“S-sky Demon Sword!”\n‘!!!’\nJump!\nThe shareholders, who were startled at those words, jumped up from their seats.\nThe eyes of Lim Kang, who was leisurely watching everything, awkwardly widened as he looked at the black sword.\n‘Sky Demon Sword? What nonsense are they talking about!’",

      "content": "The previous night, when the National Guards left.\nChairman Chun Yu-jang asked in a bewildered voice.\n“Huh? You want to convene the meeting of shareholders?”\nNot just him, but even the others couldn’t hide their shock.\nIt was Chun Yeowun who made that request.\nHe wondered if it would be possible to bring together the clan leaders under the Chun Yu-jang faction.\nMost of the top clans were in charge of affiliates.\nAs the faction’s leader, Chun Yu-jang could summon them, but if he did, he would attract the attention of the other factions who were monitoring their movements.\nAnd there had to be a reason for convening the meeting of shareholders.\n“Why? Can’t you do it?”\nIt was director Huan Myung-oh and not the chairman who answered Chun Yeowun’s question.\n“My lord. Would it be okay if I ask what is the reason for calling the members of the higher clans?”\n“Answer whether you can do it or not.”\n‘Ah...’\nThey actually could guess the reason.\nThey all thought that Chun Yeowun was trying to reveal his identity in front of those people too.\nChun Yeowun did declare that he would reintegrate and revive the Sky Demon Order, so it was natural to meet with the higher clans.\nBut.\n“It isn’t difficult to hold a meeting, but there is one problem.”\n“Problem?”\n“...There may be spies.”\nThat was the biggest problem.\nThis wouldn’t have been a problem if the Cult was still one entity, but now that it was divided into three factions, information became crucial.\nThe hostile forces couldn’t be held responsible either.\nThat’s because they all belonged to the same Cult, the Sky Demon Order.\nHowever, it was still a problem.\n“In our case, the executives, we have supported Chairman Chun Yu-jang as the next head for a long time. So the chairman trusts us. But it is different when it comes to the other clans.”\nAfter the dissolution of Black Sky Company, several clans came to support Chun Yu-jang.\nSince they couldn’t blindly suspect people, they took them in after verification, but no matter how many concerns and verifications were done, verifying thousands of people would be impossible.\n“I am not saying that everyone is suspicious. However, we cannot rule out the possibilities of spies of the other factions being planted.”\nWhich was why Chun Yu-jang had decided to make the most important meetings with just his executives.\nThat’s why the major stocks were in the control of the chairman and his executives.\n“Ancestor. I am concerned that the meeting would raise the awareness of the other two factions.”\nAt Chun Yu-jang’s words, Chun Yeowun shook his head.\nChun Yu-jang was taken aback by that response.\n“What is it, ancestor?”\n“I think I can see why you guys haven’t been able to unite the Cult for over 20 years.”\n“Sorry?”\n“Do you know about the proverb throwing grass and frightening snakes?”\nIt was meant to scare away the snake by tapping on the grass around.\nIn a way, it meant to openly cause sound and raise problems which will cause anger and raise the awareness of enemies.\n“Those who just watch and stare, will keep staring till the end. Don’t let me highlight your lack of qualities as a Lord.”\nChun Yu-jang couldn’t hide his ashamed face at those words.\nHis ancestor, Chun Yeowun, was getting more and more disappointed with him.\n“... Then what should we do?”\n“Stop complaining and just convene the meeting.”\nAll the shareholders in the conference room looked at the Sky Demon Sword in amazement.\nWho doesn’t know about that sword?\nA sacred object that had disappeared a thousand years ago.\n“Is that really the Sky Demon Sword?”\n“It is the Sky Demon Sword.”\nThe whispers grew louder and louder.\nLim Kang couldn’t hide his shock at how excited the other people were.\n‘No way! The Sky Demon Sword is in his hand!’\nHe still couldn’t forget the excitement he felt when he saw the video four days ago.\nHe even drank wine with the members of his clan, saying that the new Chun Ma was born.\nBut what was this now?\nHe wanted to shout that it was fake, but the demonic energy coming from the sword was unusual.\n‘Just what happened?’\nIt was then.\nThud!\n“Ooh. How... how could this happen!”\nOne of the presidents of the affiliates knelt on the floor.\nHis eyes were red brimming with tears as he looked at the sword.\n“Lord Chun Ma!”\n‘Chun Ma!’\nAt the word ‘Chun Ma’, everyone’s eyes turned to Chun Yeowun.\nIt was definite that the sword had disassembled from his wrist.\nThe identity was unknown, but he was undoubtedly the Master of the Sky Demon Sword.\n[Those who have the Sky Demon Sword. Will inherit the title of Chun Ma.]\nThe absolute law in the Sky Demon Order, written by the first Chun Ma.\n‘What should I do?’\nAccording to the law, everyone had to be on their knees and bow their heads.\nBut one person caught his eye.\nIt was chairman Chun Yu-jang.\nThe chairman of Black Sky Company was in prison, and with this young man holding the Sky Demon Sword, Chun Yu-jang would have to kneel too.\nIt was then.\nChun Yu-jang got up from his seat.\nEveryone looked at him.\nChun Yu-jang, the candidate for the next lord, stood up, knelt down in front of Chun Yeowun, bowed his head, and shouted louder than anyone else.\n“Chun Yu-jang greets Lord Chun Ma!”\nThud!\nAt the same time, the main office executives knelt at once and put their heads on the floor, shouting.\n“We greet Lord Chun Ma!”\nWhen even the senior members of the Cult knelt, the shareholders couldn’t hide their surprise.\nChun Yu-jang urged the others.\n“Are you being rude to the Lord right now?”\nThud!\n“We greet Lord Chun Ma!!”\nAt that, all the shareholders fell on the floor.\nAll their eyes were trembling.\nThe weight the title Chun Ma had was amazing.\nHowever, not everyone bowed their heads immediately.\n“Got you.”\nChun Yeowun smiled.\nThree men stood there, hesitating with doubtful expressions.\nAmong them was Lim Kang, a member of the Chun Woo-kyung faction.\n‘This!’\nLim Kang couldn’t hide his shock when he found two more people standing.\nThose two were also part of Chun Woo-kyung’s faction.\n‘I should have fallen down and greeted.’\nThose of the Chun Woo-kyung faction couldn’t bow down right away as they didn’t know the authenticity of the Sky Demon Sword that Chun Yeowun showed.\nAnd that momentary hesitation was a mistake.\nChun Yeowun said.\n“Chun Yu-jang.”\n“Please give your order.”\n“Kill those who aren’t related to us.”\n“Yes!”\nChun Yu-jang responded right away and gave orders to the senior executives.\n“Fulfill the order!”\n“Yes!”\nPhat!\nHuan Myung-oh and seven other executives, who were bowing, moved right away.\n“W-what!”\nThe three men who were standing panicked and tried to defend themselves.\nHowever, they weren’t the targets.\nSwosh!\n‘What?’\nPuck!\nDirector Huan had passed Lim Kang, and mercilessly stabbed one of the shareholders in the back with a knife in his arms.\n“Kuak!”\nThe shareholders who were attacked died.\n‘Why?’\nLim Kang didn’t understand what was happening.\nMeanwhile, the other seniors rushed to certain people who were on their knees and.\nPuck!\n“D-damn it!”\nRecognizing that someone died in Huan Myung-oh’s hand, the few people got up from the ground and tried to avoid the attack.\nBut they were all just Super Master level warriors.\nThe gap between them was too clear.\n“Where do you think you are going!”\nDirector Hang Yu-rin stabbed one in the head.\nAs a Superior Master, her speed was close to lightning.\nThud!\n“Kuak!”\nOne whose throat was slit, fell down with blood gushing out.\nThe others were no different.\nThey died within a few seconds.\nThud!\nAs soon as eight people died, the entire room was stained with blood.\n‘What the hell is all this?’\nThe shareholders who were still bowing couldn’t understand what they were supposed to do.\nPeople in the same room were killed.\n“Huh.”\nA man in his mid 50s with half white and half black hair, Hyang Baek, the vice-president of Yongchun furniture.\nHyang Baek looked at the ones approaching him.\n“You are the last.”\nHuan Myung-oh pointed the knife at him and said.\nGlaring back, Hyang Baek asked.\n“Director Huan... what is all this?”\n“We decided not to turn a blind eye anymore. Vice president! No, spy Jin Hyang-baek!”\nJin Hyang-baek wasn’t a member of the Sky Demon order.\nHuan Myung-oh of the Ghost Illusion clan had identified all the spies who had infiltrated the Group.\nBut left them alone in fear of friction.\n‘Is this that man’s influence?’\nJin Hyang-baek looked at Chun Yeowun.\nSince the disintegration of Black Sky Company, the Sky Demon Order avoided friction as much as possible.\nBut suddenly, there was a change of attitude.\n‘Are the vicious cultists trying to rise again?’\nHe bit his lip.\nHe had to let the outside world know about this fact. However, his chance of survival seemed slim.\nWhich meant that he had to go all out.\n‘Then...’\nContemplating, he shouted, hoping that everyone would listen.\n“You people are making a huge mistake right now!”\n“Mistake?”\n“Who do you think the dead ones are? They are the watchers sent to each faction belonging to the Murim Association. When you killed them, you declared war!”\nAt his cry, Huan Myung-oh’s expression darkened.\nThat was what he was most concerned about.\nHe accepted it because it was Chun Ma’s command, but the moment they eradicated the spies, it was war.\n‘They did something stupid.’\nLim Kang, who watched it, clicked his tongue.\nEven the Chun Woo-kyung faction avoided touching the spies to avoid fights with outside forces.\nIt was something that shouldn’t be done without looking at the Cult’s condition.\n‘They should have properly...’\nIt was then.\nWoong!\n“Euk!’\nJin Hyang-baek’s body rose and got dragged in front of Chun Yeowun.\nHe instinctively tried to raise the energy and resist it, but to no avail.\n‘W-what energy?’\nIt was hard to control his own body.\nIt was like his body wasn’t his anymore.\nAs he was flustered, Chun Yeowun said.\n“Declaration of war?”\nDespite being afraid, Jin Hyang-baek shouted.\n“Kuak! Do you think the Sky Demon Order, weakened due to disintegration and internal conflict, can handle the Murim Association and the entire Murim?”\nThe current Sky Demon Order was nothing more than the target of Murim warriors.\nJin Hyang-baek’s words weren’t wrong.\nBut Chun Yeowun’s reaction was unexpected.\n“You seem to be misunderstanding something.”\n“What?”\nGrab!\n“Eup!”\nChun Yeowun grabbed his neck.\nFingers digging into his flesh.\n“Kuaaak!”\n“Can the cult handle the entire Murim?”\n“Kuaaak!”\n“Funny. The entire Murim will have to handle me.”\n‘!?’\nJin Hyang-baek couldn’t believe his ears.\n‘W-what is this man saying...’\nCrush.\nBut before he could think about it, his head was shattered.\nChun Yeowun casually wiped off the blood that stained his hands and spoke to Lim Kang and the two others who were blankly staring at him.\n“Now that the outside rats are dealt with, let’s take care of the inside ones.”",

      "content": "Lim Kang, a member of the Chun Woo-kyung’s faction, looked at Chun Yeowun with trembling eyes.\nBlood was dripping from Chun Yeowun’s hands.\nCruelty.\nHorror.\nIt was like seeing the Devil itself.\nA sense of intimidation took over the entire room.\n‘So he attacked knowing the results of his actions?’\nHe never thought that the Chun Yu-jang faction would dare kill all the spies sent by the Murim Association without leaving a single one behind.\n‘The entire Murim will have to handle him?’\nWhat a statement.\nBut why did such arrogant words not sound like utter nonsense?\nHe felt a shiver run down his spine.\nHe looked at the Sky Demon Sword placed on the table.\nAnd blinked his eyes.\n‘Are you crazy! Lim Kang! That one is fake. Fake...’\nHe couldn’t understand why his body was telling him that the sword in front of his eyes was the real thing.\nHe felt himself fall into the abyss of profound confusion.\nAnd he wasn’t the only one swallowed in it.\nGrunt!\nHwang Yeon-gyu, a member of Chun Woo-kyung’s faction and an affiliate vice president, grunted.\n‘The real Sky Demon Sword is with Executive Director Chun Woo-kyung! Since he released the video, these people must be trying to hide it!’\nHwang Yeon-gyu decided to reveal the truth to everyone.\nLooking at the current circumstances, he realised that everyone knew now that he belonged to a different faction.\nThe shareholders meeting must have been held because the Chun Yu-jang faction saw that Chun Woo-kyung had the Sky Demon Sword and became the new Chun Ma. That’s why they were now trying to hold onto the clans below them.\nHwang Yeon-gyu opened his mouth.\n“Shareholders, no! Members of the Sky Demon Order, right now...”\nIt was then.\nTak!\n“Uh-huh!”\nChun Yeowun suddenly approached him and grabbed him by the neck.\n‘A-are you going to shut my mouth?’\nHwang Yeon-gyu looked at the other two.\nTelling them to reveal the truth on his behalf.\nHowever, unexpected words came out of Chun Yeowun’s mouth.\n“Are you trying to say that the one called Chun Woo-kyung possessed the true Sky Demon Sword and became the new Chun Ma?”\n‘!?’\nThe eyes of the three spies grew wide.\nThey thought they would shut their mouths to prevent the truth from spreading.\nHowever, this fake one had just boldly revealed it.\n‘W-what the hell is this fake one trying to do?’\nHwang Yeon-gyu stared at Chun Yeowun.\nIn a cold voice, Chun Yeowun continued.\n“Explaining it will take a lot of time.”\n“What?”\n“You foolish one who distorts the truth. Pull out your own eyes.”\n“Kuak... wh-what... nonse...”\nSwoosh!\nAt that moment, people couldn’t believe what their eyes were seeing.\nHwang Yeon-gyu’s hands were moving and reaching for his face!\n“W-what is this!”\nHe tried to stop his hands, but they didn’t respond.\nHis hands kept reaching closer and closer.\nNever in his entire life had he felt this afraid of his own hands.\n“NO! NOOOOO!”\nPuck!\n“Kuauaak!”\nPull!\nHe kept screaming as his hands dug into his eyes’ sockets and pulled them out.\n“KUUAAAAk!!!”\nWhen his eyes were completely out, his face became stained in blood.\n‘... Sky Demon energy!’\nGeneral manager Hang Yu-rin, Sound Clan leader, turned her head away.\nAs a warrior, she had seen lots of blood, but she couldn’t get herself to look at the gruesomeness occurring in front of her.\nSky Demon energy.\nThe original source of demonic energy.\nIf one didn’t learn how to control his demonic energy, then they could never be able to refuse the Sky Demon energy’s command.\n“Kuaak! Kwuak! My eyes! My eyesss!”\nHwang Yeon-gyu, who was blinded for life, kept screaming.\nThe shareholders raised their heads to look fearfully at Chun Yeowun.\n‘No way...’\n‘Hwang Yeon-gyu dug out his own eyes.’\nThey were afraid of the power of Sky Demon energy.\nIt was a power comparable to God.\nEven though they hadn’t done anything wrong, their hearts trembled.\nIn a whisper, Chun Yeowun spoke to Hwang Yeon-gyu.\n“Are you able to see the truth unmistakingly now?”\nCreepy!\nEven though he couldn’t see, the moment he heard those words, he felt terrified.\n“Kuuak! N-no! Please! Please forgive me!”\nHe begged while rubbing his hands.\nPak!\n“Kuak!”\nChun Yeowun threw Hwang Yeon-gyu away.\nAnd then looked at Lim Kang and the other standing man.\nWhen they saw Hwang Yeon-gyu, a member of their faction, dig his own eyes out, the two of them went still.\n‘W-what should I do?’\nThey had never imagined such a thing was going to happen.\nAs a result, the plan to cause chaos within the Chun Yu-jang faction failed.\nThere were only two things they could do.\nBelieve that Chun Woo-kyung was the real holder of the Sky Demon Sword and meet their death here, or recognize that this man was Chun Ma.\n“Do you also believe in the fake Chun Ma?”\nChun Yeowun asked the two.\nLim Kang struggled to open his mouth as he was in mental agony, but then with a determined look, he shouted.\n“T-there is evidence that you are not the real Chun Ma.”\n“Evidence?”\nChun Yeowun’s eyebrows rose at the word ‘evidence’.\nThe other shareholders were puzzled too.\n“Director Chun Woo-kyung has inherited the will of Chun Ma! Do-don’t claim to be a Lord by pointing that fake sword at me.”\n“How dare you!”\nAt his words, Chun Yu-jang yelled.\nHe was kneeling and bowing to Chun Yeowun, but when he heard that the sword was fake, he couldn’t help but feel enraged.\n“Lords, clan leaders and shareholders, they all know! The Sky Demon Sword is a sacred object of the Cult, but the Demon God had another sword, the White Dragon Blade!”\nSo that was why he didn’t lose his faith till the end.\nEven if the two swords were fake, Chun Woo-kyung knew how to use history to his advantage.\n“He had found the remains of Demon God that had disappeared a thousand years ago. You all know what I am talking about, right? Chun Woo-kyung has the two swords! He is Chun Ma! The Demon God wants him to unite the Cult and bring...”\n“Hahahaha”\nBefore he could even finish, Hang Yu-rin burst into laughter.\nIt wasn’t just her. The other senior executives reacted the same too.\nFrustrated, the other spy, Bu Won, shouted.\n“H-how dare you ridicule the will of the Demon God?”\n“Demon God’s will? Hahah.”\nHang Yu-rin laughed as she approached Bu Won.\nShe stopped smiling and kicked the man in his leg to forcibly make him kneel.\nPuak! Thud!\n“Kuak!”\nGrab!\nShe grabbed him by the hair.\n“Lord Chun Ma. Please allow me to behead the sinner who dares to ignorantly use your title!”\nBu Won’s expression crumbled at her words.\n“What are you talking about? Why is the title...”\nIt was then.\nChun Yeowun reached out to the ceiling.\nTututung!\nWith the sound of crashing, the ceiling got pierced, and something came into his grasp.\nA pure white sword.\nSrrng!\nWhen Chun Yeowun pulled it out of its sheath, the pure white sword appeared.\nThey felt strange energy emanating from the White Dragon Blade, the blade that cut down the Imoogi horns.\n‘White Dragon Blade?’\n‘The White Dragon Blade?’\nThe shareholders couldn’t hide their surprise.\nOne of the two major weapons of Demon God, the White Dragon Blade, appeared in front of their eyes.\nBu Won looked bewildered at it.\n“W-what the hell?”\nHe was confused when he saw the White Dragon Blade.\n“How funny! Did you say he inherited my will?”\nWoong!\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, the shareholders were confused.\nThe man was calling himself the Demon God.\nShaking his head, Chun Yeowun reached out towards the Sky Demon Sword put on the table.\nWheeing!\nIt flew and landed in front of Bu Won.\nChun Yeowun ordered.\n“Take the sword.”\n“Take the sword? What are you... ah!”\nAt that moment, against his own will, Bu Won’s hand reached out to the sword.\nTak!\nHis hand gripped the sword.\nOnly then did he understand why Hwang Yeon-gyu had dug out his own eyes.\n‘I am following his order...’\nIt was then.\nGoo!\nWheei!\nThe veins on the back of Bu Won’s hands began to bulge.\nThe blue veins turned black, and a strange thing began to happen.\n‘W-what is this!’\nBu Won was bewildered by the energy digging into his hand and tried to counter it.\nHowever, no matter what he did, the energy entering his body kept accelerating.\nCreepy!\n‘W-what is this energy!’\nHis eyes widened.\nThe more he resisted, the more he could feel it.\nStrength.\nEndless darkness.\nAnd a vicious demon.\n‘Demon energy? No. This is closer to the abyss than th...’\nWooong!\nAt that moment, the Imoogi opened its mouth and tried to swallow him.\n“Kuak!”\nHe screamed.\nThe people watching him were puzzled.\n‘What?’\n‘What is with him?’\nThey couldn’t understand why Bu Won’s body was stained in black blood.\nSuddenly, he stopped screaming and muttered.\n“Imoogi... black imoogi...”\nDrip!\nBlood vessels burst all over Bu Won’s body.\nAnd when Hang Yu-rin released his hair, the man collapsed on the floor.\nChun Yeowun looked at the only spy still standing on his feet, Lim Kang.\n“You think the Sky Demon Sword is something anyone can have?”\n“W-what do you...”\n“No one can hold the Sky Demon Sword unless he had inherited the Sky Demon energy.”\n‘!?’\nAt the word ‘Sky Demon energy’, Lim Kang’s eyes trembled.\nThere was a legend in the Sky Demon Order history.\nThe legend of the Sky Demon energy, which disappeared with the 2nd Chun Ma.\n[No possessor of the demonic energy can disobey the sky demon energy.]\nSomething which was often dismissed as a mere legend.\nBecause after the disappearance of Chun Yeowun, the 24th Lord of the Cult, no one inherited the Sky Demon energy.\n“N-no way. The Sky Demon energy... The 2nd Chun Ma disappeared with it...”\n“Kneel!”\nThud!\n“Ugh!”\nLin Kang’s knees touched the ground.\nAgainst his will.\nWith trembling eyes, he mumbled.\n“Sk-Sky demon energy...”\nIt was definitely that one.\nHe couldn’t deny it.\n‘This... this person...’\nChun Yeowun approached the man and asked.\n“Who am I?”\nAt that moment, Lim Kang banged his head on the floor and shouted.\nThud!\n“Lim Kang, an insignificant member of the Great Sky Demon Order, greets the 24th Lord known as the 2nd generation Chun Ma, the Demon God!”\nInside a hidden office.\nA man with curly hair and glasses hurried into the room and reported to someone.\n“Lord Chun Ma! See this!”\nThe person called Chun Ma wasn’t Chun Yeowun.\nIt was Chun Woo-kyung, a man in his 50s wearing a grey suit.\nThe curly-haired man put the tablet PC on the desk.\nA few taps and the screen played.\nThe site was designed to upload videos, like Youtube.\n“Has it been uploaded?”\nThe site was opened as a server secured with a special code.\nIt was used by Chun Woo-kyung members to upload videos.\nUnlike the other factions, they weren’t a company but an organization. The site was their way of reporting and communicating.\nThere was a newly uploaded video on the site, and the views kept on increasing.\n“L-look!”\nThe curly-haired man played the video.\nIt was a video taken by a CCTV camera.\nAt first, Chun Woo-kyung didn’t look interested, but as it played out, his face turned stiff.\n‘...’\nIn the second half of the video, Lim Kang, a spy placed by him in the Yongchun group, was banging his head and screaming.\n— Lim Kang, an insignificant member of the Great Sky Demon Order, greets the 24th Lord known as the 2nd generation Chun Ma, the Demon God!\nWhen Lim Kang did that, the other shareholders bowed their heads too.\nChun Woo-kyung’s face turned red. He didn’t finish the video to the end and shouted.\n“What are you all doing? Delete it right now! Hurry!”\nThe video had to be deleted before it got more views.\nBut then the video changed.\nClick!\nIt was now recorded using a phone.\nIn that video, Chun yeowun was staring straight ahead.\n— You are not Chun Ma. Chun Woo-kyun.\n“T-this...”\nA video made for him.\n— You inherited my will? You are one funny man. You will come to regret your foolishness for deceiving the Cult members with trash lies. The sin for impersonating the role of Chun Ma is nothing but death!\n‘!!!’\nClick!\nWith that, the video ended.\nChun Woo-kyung couldn’t take his eyes off the black screen.",

      "content": "Inside a Dark room.\nSomeone touched a place on the wall with their hand.\nWheing!\nThe wall cracked to reveal a black safe.\n“Haa...”\nThe man who sighed as he looked at the safe was Chun Woo-kyung.\nHe then pressed a password to open it.\nBeep! Beep! Beep! Beep!\nWhen the safe opened, an old cell phone came out. It was a foldable phone from several decades ago.\nIt was one of those phones that had no function other than calling.\nTrrring! Trrring!\nClick!\nAfter two dial tones, the call was connected.\n— Yes yes, sorry I was late for work, so I almost missed the call.\nA voice spoke.\nChun Woo-kyung replied with an expressionless face.\n“You couldn’t help it, so it’s fine.”\n— Work.... Seeing that you’re calling from this phone and not your regular one, it seems like the situation is pretty dire, right?\n“I don’t have much time.”\n— Fufuf, okay. Please tell me, Sir.\n“I need a new secure server.”\n— New server? Is something wrong?\n“The server has been exposed due to an internal problem.”\n— Oh-ho. Is that so? But the server’s IP is moving in real-time, so unless the problem is something very unique, even tracking it would be a problem, right?\nThe forged voice spoke.\nThe security of the server was thorough. It was impossible to track because the main computer, which was running the server, constantly changed the IP every hour.\n“I will pay you.”\n— Well, if you want it that much, fine. However, if it’s about securing a new server, you need to pay me at least a D-class core.\nChun Woo-kyung expected those words.\nThey had recently secured a core.\n— I think I don’t have to tell you about the advance payment.\n“... I know that. And...”\n— And? Wasn’t it a single request? If not, we may have to re-discuss the price.\nThe altered voice spoke.\nBut Chun Woo-kyung didn’t step back.\n“I want you to deal with one person.”\n— This is surprising. I remember you said that you wouldn’t ask for anything other than technical support.\n“Tell me if it’s possible or not.”\n— Huhu, where is the target?\n“Jinan city. We have to deal with him right away. However, none of the people on my side can handle him.”\n— Seems like the annoying type.\nChun Woo-kyung’s eyes were serious the entire time.\nRather than annoying, that man was dangerous enough to ruin everything he had built so far.\n— ... Sir?\n“Yes... I am listening.”\n— You need to tell us how dangerous the target is so that we can set a price.\n“S”\n— That is the highest class.\n“Exactly.”\n— S-class level threat. It seems to have caused my dear customer a lot of trouble. Hmm, if that’s the case, the payment shall be an A-class core.\nAt that, Chun Woo-kyung bit his lip. It was much higher than he had expected.\nAn A-class core was very hard to obtain, even with considerable sacrifices.\n— What would my dear customer like to do?\n‘Damn it!’\nBut he knew that it was worth it.\n“I’ll pay you right away.”\n— Okay. You are indeed the big guy. I knew that you had a refined A-class core, but it’s still shocking.\n“Enough! Can you do it right away?”\n— No problem. In fact, the Gate Warning went off in Jinan City, so I was planning on conducting an experiment to secure the core as well.\n“Experiment?”\n— Yeah, something like that. Anyway, given that you are handing me an A-class core, we shall give dear customer an excellent service concerning the new server.\n“... okay. I expected no less.”\n— Please send the information about the S-class target. Bye\nClick!\nThe phone call disconnected.\nChun Woo-kyung, who had been leaning against the wall for a long time, pulled out a cigarette from his inner pocket and bit it with trembling hands.\n“How did I end up like this... Damn it! To die in the hands of some old remnant!”\n—--\nThe following day.\nInside the Yongchun Group’s main office in Jinan city.\nChairman Chun Yu-jang, who had undergone a splicing surgery, was wearing a cast as he spoke in an excited voice to Chun Yeowun.\n“It has only been a day but the effect is amazing!”\nThe reason behind his excitement was simple.\nIt was because of the result of uploading the CCTV footage into the server that Lim Kang gave yesterday.\nOn the tablet PC placed on the desk, the figures of Chun Woo-kyung faction members that they had come into contact with were marked.\n“In just one day, we have come into contact with 33 clans. Eight of which are high clans. It seems like we are off to a good start. Ancestor.”\nChun Yeowun’s appearance played a significant factor in it.\nHe boldly revealed his identity through the video and caused confusion and division in the Chun Woo-kyung faction.\nThe results were frighteningly quick, considering that the video was uploaded just 17 hours ago.\nBut Chun Yeowun wasn’t satisfied.\n“Lacking.”\nFrom what he heard, the number of clans in the present age was around 700.\nAmong them, 146 were currently in Chun Woo-kyung’s faction. But only 33 clans joined them, so less than a third.\n“Still, with this momentum, it won’t take long for our faction to gain the upper hand.”\nChun Yu-jang viewed it positively.\n‘I didn’t think that the presence of my ancestor would have such a huge impact.’\nChun Yu-jang couldn’t hide his satisfaction. However, Chun Yeowun suddenly asked with cold eyes.\n“Your faction?”\n“Huh?”\n“Oh! It seems like you are mistaking something. Do you think that I am giving you these instructions to highlight your faction?”\n‘Oops!’\nChun Yu-jang couldn’t hide his embarrassed face when he realized that he had made such a stupid mistake.\n“T-that...”\n“Let me make it clear. There are no factions in the Cult. Keep that in mind.”\n“... I sincerely apologize for my foolish remark.”\nChun Yu-jang responded with a nervous voice at Chun Yeowun’s warning.\nAt the end of the day, he could feel his heart going smaller and smaller the more he tried to please Chun Yeowun.\n“You! Stop working on Murim for the time being and concentrate on the company management and expansion.”\n“T-that...”\n“Answer me!”\n“Yes.”\nChun Yu-jang had no choice.\nFortunately, that would mean that Chun Yeowun wouldn’t have any operating rights on the company, so money wouldn’t be lost.\nChun Yeowun was planning on dividing the current strength of Yongchun into two groups. One for managing the company, which Chairman Chun Yu-jang would do, and the other would work on matters related to Murim under him.\nHe thought that it would be more efficient as Chun Yu-jang could provide more intricate details about the current world.\n“Huan Myung-oh.”\n“Yes!”\nHuan Myung-oh, who was watching from the side, answered.\nChun Yeowun handed him something.\n“Ah!”\nThe USB that Chun Yeowun asked for last night.\n“A total of 320 places.”\n“What?”\n“The locations the server of Chun Woo-kyung was running from.”\n“Huh? How did you...”\nHuan Myung-oh couldn’t hide his surprise. He also had instructed his clan members to track it down.\nHowever, they said that it was impossible to find because of the frequent change of IP.\nMoreover, less than 30 minutes after the video was uploaded, the whole server was completely shut down.\nIn the end, he almost gave up, but Chun Yeowun had somehow managed to pick the locations of the computers running the server.\n‘The Lord is good at hacking?’\nHuan Myung-oh was shocked.\nOf course, it was Nano who did it. Nano could easily hack the IP movement, but since there were 320 computers running it, it was impossible to find the real place.\n“I’ll give you a week. Find out where he’s based.”\n“Yes!”\n“Hang Yu-rin.”\n“Yes!”\nAs if waiting, she stood up and answered.\n“How is the Jinan’s Murim Association movement?”\n“As asked, I put a mark on all the clans that belong to the Murim Association in Jinan city. There has been no movement from the Jegal Cultural Foundation Side and the HB (Hwang Bo clan). It seems they haven’t figured it out yet.”\n“If there is any movement to hold meetings or to convene Murim members into meetings, take action right away.”\n“Yes!”\nSmile.\nA smile crept on her lips.\nChun Yeowun had ordered them to stop them before they could even meet.\nAll this time, the Chun Yu-jang faction had avoided friction with the Murim Association, so she was fond of this.\n“Blade Six?”\nChun Yeowun had bigger interests.\nAlthough no one of the spies belonged to Blade Six, he had no intention of overlooking them as just a long-time enemy’s descendant.\n“I was going to report it, but last night, we found Six Essence’s men searching in Hwangseong park.”\n“Searching?”\n“Yes. I don’t know what they were looking for. They searched until two in the morning and then withdrew.”\nShe seemed upset about not being able to find anything.\nChun Yu-jang seemed gloomy at the order to stay away from Murim when Chun Yeowun called him.\n“Chun Yu-jang.”\n“Y-yes!”\n“Did you say that not only the National Guards, but also the civil servants of Jinan city hall are under your favor?”\n“Yes.”\nIn order to have firm roots in the city, Chun Yu-jang had built a well-maintained relationship.\n“Make an exception and receive a favor.”\n“Huh? Exception...?”\n“Secure all CCTV footage in the park and everything in its vicinity for 48 hours .”\n“I see!”\nChun Yu-jang’s face brightened at the command.\nHe was worried that he had been totally excluded from the work of Murim, but he wasn’t.\n‘Huh...’\nThe executives were shocked at how quickly things were going.\nThey didn’t disclose it as they feared that Chun Yu-jang would feel bad, but Chun Yeowun’s actions were swift.\n‘When was the last time we had such a smooth meeting?’\n‘Amazing.’\n‘He is the one who had revived the Cult in the past and he’s doing it again in our time.’\nThey thought that his martial arts were the best, but his ability to lead was also amazing. There was no comparison with Chun Yu-jang.\nIt was clear to them what Chun Yeowun meant when he said that their chairman lacked the qualities of a Lord.\nKnock!\nSomeone knocked on the door.\nThe person who entered was Bi Mak-heon.\nThe senior executives were puzzled because he wasn’t supposed to show up. But the man bowed to Chun Yeowun.\n“As ordered, we have completed the recruitment of members for the vice chairman. We have selected 50 people with great skills.”\n‘Ahhh...’\nThey nodded their heads.\nThey weren’t even sure when his office people were recruited.\nOriginally, it shouldn’t exceed 10 people, but the fact that such a large number was selected meant that there was a mission.\n“I am not sure how you will feel about them. But those chosen will consider it an honor.”\n“The highest honor a Cult member could ever get.”\nThe seniors said that. When.\nDrrrr!\n‘Huh?’\nA phone vibrated.\nHowever, it wasn’t just one, but all the phones within the room.\nThe seniors looked at the screen on their phones. Their faces suddenly went stiff.\n‘Ugh!’\nIt was a test message from the HR team. A notification stating those with the best abilities in their departments had been transferred.",

      "content": "‘Director Huan is also in the team?’\nNod nod!\nHuan Myung-oh nodded his head with a bitter face.\nRegardless of who they were, those with the best abilities in each department were selected.\nSince the ones recruited had to be above the Super master level, it was no surprise that the ones directly under the chairman were selected.\n‘Y-you traitors!’\nThe transfer was only possible with the consent of the parties involved.\nIn a word, all these people moved to the vice-chairman’s office because they wanted it too.\n‘I would have accepted too.’\n‘Without even asking...’\nThe other executives couldn’t hide their disappointment.\nAfter all, they wouldn’t even think twice if they were asked to work directly under Chun Ma.\n‘Chairman...’\nThey all looked at Chun Yu-jang and sighed.\nFrom the moment Chun Yeowun appeared, Chun Yu-jang’s role turned into that of a mere secretary.\n“Good job.”\n“Not at all! I have just executed the orders.”\nHaving heard the compliment, the executives were stunned at Bi Mak-heon’s appearance.\nIt was regrettable that they couldn’t notice such a person.\nAt that moment, Chun Yu-jang opened his mouth.\n“General Manager Bi Mak-heon.”\n“Yes, chairman.”\n“We are going to hold off on your promotion for the time being.”\n“Sorry?”\nBi Mak-heon’s eyes shook.\nIt was only yesterday evening that he was told he would be promoted to managing director.\nAnd now, he was flustered at the sudden withholding of his position.\n“It is unfortunate, but you are being demoted.”\nAt Chun Yu-jang’s words, Bi Mak-heon seemed to be close to weeping. The executives frowned, thinking that this was their chairman’s way of showing disdain for snatching away his members.\n“W-why?”\nChun Yeowun answered.\n“For the time being, I’ll have you take over as assistant manager for my office.”\n‘!!!’\nBi Mak-heon’s eyes widened.\nHe was confused because he thought he was really being demoted, but when he heard that he was appointed as the assistant manager serving under Chun Yeowun, his face brightened in an instant.\n“Is this true?”\n“Why? You don’t like it?”\n“Ah No! It is a lifetime honor to serve under you!”\nThud!\nBi Mak-heon knelt and bowed to Chun Yeowun.\nTo become assistant manager literally meant to play the role of being Chun Yeowun’s right arm.\nSure it was a demotion, but in other words, he was going to be in the centre of the new Sky Demon Order.\n‘Demotion what shit?’\n‘... damn it.’\nThe faces of some executives darkened.\nIf the Sky Demon Order was going to be unified in the future, the one working as assistant manager for Chun Yeowun would shine brightly.\nTheir eyes were dyed with envy.\n‘Now there is only one thing to do before heading back to Shenyang and bringing them.’\nNumerous plans were being drawn inside Chun Yeowun’s head.\nAfter subduing the three factions, Jinan city will serve as the foundation of the Cult’s resurrection.\nThe final goal was to retake Gwangju city, which had the Ten Thousand Mountains.\n‘We need to take it from Oshin.’\nGwangju city, where Ten thousand mountains were, was said to be occupied by the Oshin Group.\nHe heard it was one of the three major factions in Murim.\nThe factions within the Murim Association were the Forces of Justice alliance, Blade Six and Oshin Group.\nThe Chairman of Oshin Group was said to be the representative of the Murim Association.\n‘How dare they take what belongs to the Cult!’\nChun Yeowun’s second goal was to drive out everyone who targeted the Sky Demon Order and planned its downfall.\nBefore that, it was necessary to have power on their side.\nHowever, the Sky Demon Order needed a very important thing.\n‘An achievement...’\nNot just Murim, but everyone in this land seemed to think badly of the Black Sky Company and the Sky Demon Order.\nWhich meant they should seize an opportunity to change the image.\n‘We need to instill awareness that the Sky Demon Order is necessary for everyone.’\nIt was essential to change the perception in order to win the support of the general public.\n‘Is there a good way?’\nA solution then suddenly came to Chun Yeowun.\nA catastrophe of mankind.\nAn enemy of mankind.\nWhether it was the Murim Association or the Gate Keepers of the National Guards, an enemy made them work together.\nThe Gate.\nThe disaster coming out of the Gate had only one goal.\nTo exterminate mankind.\nDigging into that gap may be a way to change the perception of the Sky Demon Order.\n‘It is a shame that they were ignoring such good chances by fighting with each other.’\nThe Yongchun Group didn’t register in Murim.\nThey avoided participating in Gate battles to avoid exposure.\nIf they had endured the hardships for the last 27 years, the perception would have already changed.\nThey lost the best advantage they had to fear.\n“Bi Mak-heon.”\n“Yes!”\nBi Mak-heon, who was bowing, got up and answered.\n“Prepare the car.”\n“Yes.”\nAt that, Chun Yu-jang asked with a puzzled expression.\n“Going somewhere?”\nChun Yeowun got up from his seat and put on his coat.\n“Which hospital did that wench say she was going to?”\n‘Ah...’\nThe word wench made him understand.\nIt was her.\n“Ilcheon General Hospital.”\n“The treatment I gave her should be adequate, so I should start using her slowly. Hm, using her as a secretary would be appropriate.”\nWith those words, Chun Yeowun left the room.\nChun Yu-jang was left muttering in confusion.\n“... using an SS-class Keeper as his secretary?”\nIlcheon General Hospital was an affiliated group of Yongchun.\nIn one of its wards, a woman in her late twenties, with brown hair and voluptuous breasts not fully covered by the patient’s dress, was sitting on the bed.\nThe woman with provocative eyes was an SS-class Gate Keeper, Yu So-hwa the Gravity Witch.\nHer gaze was on the flowerpots near the window of her room.\n[I wish you a fast recovery. Commander-in-chief of Jinan City Defense Force, General Jo Yoon.]\n[With you, citizens are guaranteed safety. Jinan Public Security Bureau Director, Liu Cheng-sun.]\n[The Deputy Mayor would like to express his gratitude for your service.]\nThey were all wishes for recovery.\nAs an SS-class Gate Keeper, she was loyal to the officials in Jinan.\nThe director of the Public Security Bureau had visited her in person.\n‘I don’t know anything anymore.’\nThe joint surgery on her right arm was successfully completed.\nIt was a clean-cut, so the regenerative treatment of the nerves went very smoothly.\n‘Haa.’\nHer eyes looked at the room entrance.\nTwo men in black suits were standing there.\nThey were the security agents of Yongchun who were monitoring her.\n[The National Defense’s affiliated hospital isn’t allowed. Instead, we will arrange for you to receive treatment at our hospital. However, please hold back your words to your visitors.]\nThose were the words of someone called Bi Mak-heon.\nThe words telling her not to reveal that she was now working under Chun Yeowun.\nAround a thousand nano bombs were injected into her body.\n‘How did it get to this?’\nEven if she had SS-class superpowers, there was no way she could remove the nano bombs inside her blood vessels.\nShe thought of running away.\nHowever, there were agents moving around the whole hospital.\n‘If I could, I’d kill them all.’\nIt wasn’t an impossible task given her abilities, but if she started an assault, they would certainly contact him.\nThat ruthless monster will detonate the nano bombs without mercy.\n‘I need to calm down.’\nUnneeded excitement would only make her hurt herself.\nIt was when she was trying to do that.\nKnock!\nWith a knock, the door opened and a man in a black suit spoke.\n“You have visitors.”\n“... let them in.”\nThree people entered.\nA woman in her late 20s with short hair and red glasses, and two men in casual attire like college students.\nYu So-hwa looked at the woman in red glasses, who stood out.\nThud!\nThe door closed.\nOne of the two men put his palm on the door.\nAnd the woman with the red glasses slowly opened her lips.\n“The sound won’t go out, so don’t worry.”\n“I didn’t think you would come. Hye-yeon.”\nIt seemed like they were familiar with each other.\nThe woman in red glasses answered.\n“You are as rude as ever.”\n“Are you really calling me that despite your sarcastic way of talking?”\n“Whatever. I see it’s true that an SS-class Keeper was defeated? When did my rival become so weak?”\nAt her words, Yu So-hwa laughed.\nHye-yeon, the woman in red glasses, was an S-class Keeper, who considered Yu So-hwa her rival.\nYu So-hwa acknowledged her strength as well.\nHer ability was dangerous even against an SS-class.\n“We don’t have time.”\nHye-yeon gestured to the man who had his hand on the door.\nWhile the other man pulled out a small terminal from the sleeve.\nHye-yeon smiled.\n“You owe me one now. We used a C-class core to get this.”\n“... okay.”\nThe man pressed the button on the terminal.\nBeep!\nThe ultrasound of a dolphin echoed through the ears.\nAfter around 10 seconds of ringing, the man turned off the terminal.\n“Done. Now that the nano bombs have been removed, let’s move.”\nThat was the purpose of the terminal.\nThe device sent out a code frequency which stopped the bombs in Yu So-hwa’s body.\nYu So-hwa’s face brightened at those words.\n“I will never forget this debt.”\n“Right. Now let’s get out of here. If someone interferes, we’ll destroy everything. Hahah.”\n“You can’t do that.”\n“Huh? Why?”\n“If we do so, he will be contacted.”\n“... he, are you talking about the Murim warrior who made you like this?”\n“Yes.”\n“I don’t know how much of a monster he is, but don’t you know my power? If he is a human...”\n“Fine. Let’s get out.”\n“Ungrateful wench!”\nAs she got up, Hye-yeon grumbled.\nThe man who had his palm on the door was sweating profusely.\nBang!\nAt that moment, the room opened and the agents in black suits entered.\n“What are you people doing?”\n“State your identities?”\nThey were unable to open the door because of the man’s abilities.\nLooking at them, Hye-yeon smiled and said.\n“Will you be fine staying by my side?”\n“What are you talking.... Huk!”\nShocked, one of the agents took a knife from his pocket and then stabbed the agent next to him.\nPuck!\n“Kua! Why?”\nThe stabbed agent was shocked, but the other man took the knife out and then started to stab him again with delighted eyes.\nPuck! Puck!\n“You monster! Die! Die!”\nThud!\nThe stabbing stopped when the man died.\nThe agent’s eyes ceased to be dazed and then looked at his fellow agent lying dead on the floor.\n“W-what the hell is this?”\n“You kill your own men with your hands.”\nHye-yeon said with a smile.\n“Euik!”\nThe agent kept staring at the blood-soaked knife in his hand when Hye-yeon said.\n“You killed a comrade, what are you going to do now?”\nHaving heard that, the agent’s eyes lost focus again. He grabbed the knife and placed it near his neck.\nPuck!\nAnd fell to the floor.\nSeeing that, Yu So-hwa said.\n“Still a bad move.”\n“They made you like this, did you think I will let them live?”\n“Stop. There are civilians in the hallways, so don’t do such things.”\n“Pretending to be a nice girl.”\nThey came out of the room. There were civilians, patients and other agents too.\n“Kyaaaak!”\nHye-yeon shouted.\nExpectedly, people’s eyes turned to her.\nClapping her hands, Hye-yeon said.\nClap!\n“Time to sleep!”\nThud! Thud! Thud!\nAt that moment, everyone fell to the ground. They fell asleep. One could tell from the snoring sounds coming from them.\n“Kay. Ready?”\nA shocking ability.\nAmong the S-class keepers, people with outstanding abilities were sometimes given titles.\nAnd this woman’s title was The Illusionist.\nAt first glance, it seemed like a psychic ability unsuited for combat. However, it was a hypnotic ability classified as dangerous one by the state council.\n“Nice.”\nThey hurried to the elevator in the block’s lobby.\nBecause Hye-yeon had hypnotic abilities, she was thinking of walking out proudly.\nHowever, when they turned the corner and reached the lobby.\nThey heard the sound of the elevator stopping.\nDing!\nIt looked like someone was stopping on this floor.\nWhen the elevator’s door opened, Yu So-hwa’s expression hardened.\n“Where do you think you are going?”\nShe could feel her heart drop.\n‘W-why at a time like this?’\nThe ones who got off the elevator were Chun Yeowun, Bi Mak-heon, and a few hospital security guards.\nChun Yeowun looked at the fallen people in the hallway and asked in a cold voice.\n“Maybe I should tighten the leash a little more?”\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun raised his finger.\nIt looked like he was going to detonate a bomb.\nYu So-hwa bit her lip.\n“It doesn’t work anymo...”\nSnap! Phut!\n“Kuaaaak!”\nHer left hand turned dark with a loud bang.\nHye-yeon looked at Yu So-hwa in perplexion, unable to understand what had just happened.\n“I-I disarmed the nano bombs, so how?”",

      "content": "Hye-yeon used all her connections to get the terminal containing the code to disarm the nano bombs through the black market.\nIt was a genuine handset from MS, which was obtained by giving them a C-class core.\nThat’s why she was puzzled at the nano bomb explosion.\n‘Did they give me a defective product?’\n“Eukk!”\nSeeing Yu So-hwa writhe in pain, Chun Yeowun was satisfied.\nThe terminal wasn’t defective or fake.\nIt did genuinely contain the code to disarm the bombs.\nUnder normal circumstances, the nano bombs would have been disarmed and would later come out through urine.\n‘This is Nano’s effect.’\n[Right.]\nIf only Nano wasn’t there, everything would have worked out according to their plan.\nNano, who has a much more advanced technology regarding nanotech, conducted some modifications on the bombs that Chun Yeowun took out from Baek Jong-so’s body.\nUnlike the original ones, which, in terms of manipulation, could only be disarmed, the new ones could move more freely.\n“Damn the black market!”\nUnaware of that, Hye-yeon grumbled.\nContrary to her intelligent-looking appearance, she was a pretty rough woman.\n“Fine. Doesn’t matter.”\n“What do you mean it doesn’t matter?”\n“I think it went well. Now I will deal with him and prove that I am far superior to an SS-class Gate Keeper.”\nBi Mak-heon was taken aback by her bold words.\n“Vice-chairman. May I?”\nSsshhh!\nBi Mak-heon’s hand headed towards the sword.\nSince Yu So-hwa was bound by the nano bombs, Chun Yeowun granted his request.\n“Take care of it.”\n“Yes!”\nPhat!\nAs if waiting, Bi Mak-heon went for her at once.\nAs a master of Illusion Swordsmanship, his swordsmanship changed right away. His aim was a single fatal attack.\n“Go!”\n“Hooho! Dare attack me?”\nStop!\nAt that moment, Bi Mak-heon, who was unfolding his technique, forcibly stopped.\n“Cough!”\nHe was flustered to see his body stop. But then his body knelt down, and he banged his head on the ground.\n“I-I have been deceived by the enemy and almost attacked the vice-chairman!”\nThud!\n‘!?’\nChun Yeowun’s eyebrows rose at the sight. Bi Mak-heon apologized over and over to Hye-yeon as if she was him.\nLicking her lips, she pointed to Chun Yeowun.\n“Now we need to deal with the enemy.”\nAt her words, Bi Mak-heon got up from the ground and went for Chun Yeowun.\n“How dare you deceive me! I will cut off this woman’s head!”\nConversely, he saw Chun Yeowun as Hye-yeon.\nShe spoke with a delighted tone at the sight.\n“Huh! Let the allies fight.”\nIt was then.\nChun Yeowun held out his hand towards Bi Mak-heon and moved it down lightly.\nThud!\nBi Mak-heon forcibly knelt down.\n“Kuauak!”\nBi Mak-heon remained stuck to the floor.\nSeeing that, Hye-yeon frowned while mumbling.\n“... shit.”\nShe thought that she would be able to gain some time, but she was overpowered.\nYu So-hwa, who was groaning in pain, opened her mouth.\n“You can’t subdue him like that.”\n“Huh. I think so. But it doesn’t matter. The stronger my enemy, the better. It is fortunate that I came.”\nWink!\nHye-yeon winked at her and looked at Chun Yeowun.\nTheir eyes met.\nHowever, there was a strange light shining in her pupils.\n“Huhu. It is over!”\nShe confidently pointed to the sword that Bi Mak-heon dropped.\n“That nice thing there. Pick it up.”\n“...”\n“Pick it up!”\nShe said it in a slightly stronger way.\nChun Yeowun reached out to the floor and retrieved the sword.\nFor a second, she wondered if her ability didn’t work, but it was a good idea to repeat the order again.\n“Now. Stab yourself with that.”\nChun Yeowun raised the sword.\nThe guards around him panicked and tried to stop him.\n“Stab yourself already!”\nHye-yeon shouted.\n“What are you talking about?”\n“Huh?”\nSwish! Puck!\n“Kuaaauk!”\nThrown by Chun Yeowun, Bi Mak-heon’s sword pierced her thigh. As it was unexpected, she grabbed her thigh, screaming in pain.\n“Damn it!”\nOne of the Keepers standing beside her rushed towards Chun Yeowun.\nSharp steel spikes sprouted from his body.\nIt seemed like this person had the ability to protect his body with steel thorns and even use them to attack.\n“Hump!”\nHaving narrowed the distance, the Keeper leaned forward. The steel thorns were fired from his body like missiles and aimed for Chun Yeowun and the guards.\nHowever, his opponent wasn’t weak.\nChun Yeowun waved his hand, and all the projectiles flying towards him pierced the wall next to him.\n“Kuak!”\nThe Keeper tried to regenerate the thorns once again.\nChun Yeowun, who saw that, lowered his hand.\n“What now?”\nChak!\nThe sound of a slash echoed as the Keeper’s body got split in half.\nEven the thorns on his body were cut off.\nThe other Keeper reached out to Chun Yeowun when he saw his colleague get killed.\n“You bastard!”\nWoong!\n“Euk!”\n“What is this?”\nThe guards were pushed away as invisible walls appeared around Chun Yeowun.\nThe ability of this Keeper was to create a thin wall of air.\n“Don’t try to do anything.”\nThe ability could be used to exert pressure on people.\nThe invisible wall could be decreased in size.\nAnd if that was done, the opponent would be crushed.\nChun Yeowun, who was inside, mumbled something which wasn’t heard.\nThe ability would block sound, so no one could hear him.\n“Die!”\nThe wall was rapidly compressed.\nIt was then.\nSlash!\nChun Yeowun raised his hand and cut the wall.\nLike a broken window, the wall made of air shattered.\n“This is like a kid’s play toy.”\n“W-what is...”\nThe Keeper couldn’t hide his shock.\nHe has never seen someone break out of his ability before.\n“Let’s end this.”\nChun Yeowun waved his hand, making the head of the keeper bend sideways.\nCrack!\n“Kuak!”\nThud!\nThe Keeper silently died.\n“Ahhh..”\nYu So-hwa sighed.\nShe actually had high expectations regarding Hye-yeon’s ability. The ability to hypnotize any living being. Unless it was a special alpha type entity, it worked on everything else.\n‘That monster.’\nYu So-hwa realized the absurdity of Chun Yeowun’s existence.\n‘H-how the hell is he not caught?’\nHye-yeon was still not able to believe her eyes.\nIt was the first time that such a thing had happened.\nShe was able to hypnotize every single Murim warrior she had met before.\n‘Why! Why! Why isn’t it working!?’\nWhooo!\nHer eyes were still glowing.\nShe was still trying to use her ability on Chun Yeowun, to hypnotize him, to control him. However, nothing worked.\n“Seventy eight times.”\n‘!!!’\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, Hye-yeon’s eyes fluttered.\nIt was an exact count.\n“You tried so hard to get into my senses.”\n“Ha!”\nHye-yeon was extremely shocked.\nThe man knew exactly what she was trying to do.\nHer ability allowed her to control the senses of the human body in order to handle them freely.\n“Enough... we have played a lot.”\nChun Yeowun walked towards her.\nMaking Hye-yeon cry out.\n“Stop!”\n“That doesn’t work on me.”\n“Huh! Ugh! And your subordinates?”\n“Hm?”\nAt her words, Chun Yeowun turned around to see the four guards aiming their weapons at their own necks.\nHye-yeon warned him.\n“If you move even one step or try to harm us, you will see them take their own lives.”\nGulp!\nThe guards were pushing the weapons closer to the necks.\nHe didn’t think that the woman would use her ability in such a way.\n‘Someday I will repay this disgrace you have shown me.’\nRunning away hurt Hye-yeon’s pride.\nHowever, having made a firm resolve within her, she dragged her leg and pulled Yu So-hwa.\n“Come up. Let’s get out of here...”\nWhen Chun Yeowun said.\n“Throw away the weapons.”\nClank!\nAt Chun Yeowun’s command, the hypnotized guards threw away their weapons on the floor.\nHaving witnessed the ridiculous scene, Hye-yeon’s eyes went wide.\n“W-what is this?”\nThe men were still hypnotized.\nHowever, they were taking someone else’s command nonetheless.\n‘No! Has to be a coincidence!’\n“Eik! It doesn’t matter if you don’t have weapons! Choke yourselves!”\nShe screamed as if she was possessed by an evil spirit.\nThe guards grabbed their throats.\nAnd Chun Yeowun spoke again.\n“Don’t move.”\nStill!\nAt his firm command, the guards stopped moving.\nHye-yeon couldn’t understand what was happening.\n“H-how did this happen...”\n“Such a waste. The power of Sky Demon energy is far more superior than that ability of yours.”\nObviously, Hye-yeon’s ability was strong.\nHowever, there was no way to make a human go against the demonic energy which came from the corrupted spirit beast.\nNot knowing that, she was flustered.\n“S-Sky Demon energy, what is...”\nShhh!\nIn an instant, Chun Yeowun’s image blurred and reappeared in front of the woman.\nChun Yeowun grabbed her by the neck.\nCatch!\n“Kuak!”\n“I am sick of playing anymore.”\n“Kuak!”\nHye-yeon’s face turned red.\nShe felt like she was going to die from suffocation at any moment. It had been a long time since her prideful heart was severely broken.\nThe SS-class Keeper Yu So-hwa knew what that felt like. However, she didn’t have the courage to interfere.\n‘Am I going to die like this? If it wasn’t for her...’\nHye-yeon’s eyes looked at Yu So-hwa with resentful eyes.\nShe then came up with a good way to get out of the situation.\n“S...a...v...e...me...”\n“Save you?”\nChun Yeowun’s grip on her neck loosened. Hye-yeon, who was barely able to take a breath, said.\n“Haa.. haa.. I, too, am useful to you... like Yu So-hwa.”\n“Useful. Hmm.”\nChun Yeowun looked like he was thinking for a moment.\n‘It worked!’\nThinking that she had a chance, she let out a rough breath and then spoke with a seductive look.\n“Haaa... I will dedicate both my body and mind to you.”\n“Body and mind?”\n“Yes... if you don’t believe me, you can put nano bombs in my body.”\n‘No.’\nShe was shaking her head.\nShe had to live her life, even if it meant to live trembling as a slave of the monstrous man.\n‘Ridiculous. I am not going to die here.’\nShe didn’t want to die.\nRather, she decided that she would somehow survive, improve her abilities and then take down the monster.\n‘Even if it is impossible for that bitch, I can.’\nUnlike Yu So-hwa, she was confident in handling men.\nLooking at Chun Yeowun, she thought that she had a chance.\nShe knelt down and said.\n“You know. I am hotter in bed than Yu So-hw...”\n“How arrogant.”\n“Huh?”\nHye-yeon, who was trying her best to seduce him, went stiff.\nChun Yeowun looked at her with contemptuous cold eyes.\n“I have changed my mind.”\n“W-what do you mean?”\n“People who have a 4 year old brain are worthless.”\n“W-wait a minute, why is that bitch...”\nGrab!\n“Kuak!”\n“Don’t talk nonsense and just die.”\nCrack!\n“Kuak!”\nAs she struggled, Chun Yeowun mercilessly broke her neck.\nWith a welp, the woman died.\nPak!\nChun Yeowun threw her body to the floor.\nHer initial plan of highlighting the usefulness of her ability was good. But she failed to realize that Chun Yeowun didn’t like women who tried to tempt others.\n“Ump!”\nYu So-hwa covered her mouth, trying not to scream at what she had just witnessed.\nChun Yeowun turned to her and said.\n“Are your attempts to run away now over?”",

      "content": "A black sedan was driving down the road in Jinan city.\nSitting in the sedan’s passenger seat was the vice chairman’s assistant manager, Bi Mak-heon, who turned on the tablet PC and handed it.\nReceiving it, Yu So-hwa looked at the content of the contract written in it.\nThe contract wasn’t much different from what regular companies would generally draft.\n“Please take a good look and sign.”\n“But I am still a Gate Keeper.”\nIf she signed this one, it would be treated as if she had taken double contracts.\nAt her concern, Bi Mak-heon smiled and said.\n“You don’t have to worry about that. There is also a resignation letter in the next PDF file. Just fill in your personal information and sign. Our legal team will discuss the rest with the Defense Bureau.”\nAll preparations had been made.\nAs she looked through the documents, her eyes stopped at the salary.\nIt was too high for a mere secretary job.\n“Wasn’t I supposed to be a secretary?”\nChun Yeowun, who was sitting next to her, answered.\n“It is the payment fit for your abilities.”\nThe annual salary was 5 billion won.\nOnly the strongest level Murim warrior would be given that salary. Even among the Gate Keepers, only an SS-class keeper would be given such a high salary.\nIt wasn’t something that a secretary would be given.\n‘What is he up to?’\nShe couldn’t understand.\nAfter all, she had to follow the man whether she liked it or not because of the nano bombs inside her body.\nChun Yeowun answered her concerns.\n“The amount was set according to your abilities. There is also a real price that depends on your behaviour.”\n“Real price?”\n“I will get rid of the nano bombs in your body one after another whenever you do something worth it.”\n“Huh?”\nShe was shocked.\nShe never thought that such an offer would be made.\n“Right now, there are 987 bombs in your body.”\nIt was the number of bombs left after the last explosion.\nYu So-hwa spoke in a voice revealing her disbelief.\n“How are you going to remove the bombs one by one?”\nChun Yeowun smiled.\n‘Nano. Take one nano bomb out of her body.’\n[Yes.]\nSoon, Yu So-hwa seemed to have a runny nose.\nFor someone who was often called a beauty, a runny nose was unusual to see.\nYu So-hwa hurriedly tried to wipe it off.\n“Stay still.”\nAt Chun Yeowun gesture, the runny nose slowly moved up in the form of a droplet.\n“W-what are you doing?\nYu So-hwa yelled with a blush running up her face.\nLooking at that, Chun Yeowun clicked his tongue.\n“Tch.I said stay still!”\n“Ahh...”\nWheeing!\nChun Yeowun opened the window and moved the drop of water out.\nSnap!\nChun Yeowun snapped his finger.\nPang!\nAt that moment, a small visible explosion occurred outside the window.\nYu So-hwa was shocked.\nIt was so small on the outside, but when it burst inside, it hurt like hell.\n‘He was telling the truth!’\nShe couldn’t put it into words, but she was shocked.\nWhat Chun Yeowun had just shown her was effective.\nFor her, who was suffering from psychological pressure due to the nano bombs, this was an attractive proposal.\n“Now there are 986 left.”\nHesitating, YU So-hwa asked Chun Yeowun.\n“Are you... really going to get rid of the nano bombs each time I achieve something?”\n“Do I have to repeat myself?”\nYu So-hwa’s hand trembled while holding the pen.\nShe was someone who fell into despair as she saw other Gate Keepers die in front of her eyes.\nHowever, this proposal gave her a glimmer of hope.\nSssss!\nWithout any hesitation, she signed the contract with a brighter face.\n“Here.”\nShe handed the tablet PC and the pen to BI Mak-heon.\nBi Mak-heon smiled.\n‘H-he really got an SS-class Gate Keeper as his exclusive secretary.’\nAnd the woman had accepted it herself.\nIf Chun Yeowun wanted, he could have made her succumb to despair and get her to work.\nBut with the right means, he motivated her.\nNow, she will move however Chun Yeowun wants.\n“Yu So-hwa. No, from now on, I will call you secretary Yu.”\n“Yes. Uhm.”\n“It is vice-chairman.”\n“Yes. Vice-chairman.”\n“With the power of an SS-class Gate Keeper, is it possible to have a private meeting with a mayor-level person?”\nShe still hadn’t resigned as Gate Keeper.\nWhich was why, as a member with a high ranking in the National Guard, she would be able to request a private meeting.\nBesides, she was the famous SS-class Gate Keeper.\n“It is possible, but.”\n“Good.”\n“Huh?”\n“Go to Jinan City hall.”\n“Yes.”\nThe driver immediately turned the vehicle.\n‘Jinan City Hall?’\nYu So-hwa looked at Chun Yeowun with curious eyes.\nJinan city’s Ilcheon general hospital.\nCCTV room in the basement of the hospital.\nThe security staff laid dead on the floor.\nIt was as if they were asleep, but not breathing.\nTatatak!\nAn unidentified person was checking the footage while typing something on the keyboard.\nHe was wearing a black hat and a grey burberry coat.\nThe man who kept looking for something in the recorded folders, pulled out an old cellphone and made a call.\nTrrring! Click!\n— What happened? Did you find it?\nAn altered voice answered the phone.\nThe man in the black hat shook his head and said.\n“Looks like we were late.”\n— How unfortunate.\n“However, there is something strange.”\n— Hmm?\n“All videos recorded when the target arrived have been deleted.”\n— Hmm... they must have done something which shouldn’t be shown to the public.\n“Should I investigate?”\n— No. Don’t bother. Just focus on your goal.\n“Sigh... this is getting a little annoying. I don’t have time because of the Gate Warning, and we were interrupted by them yesterday as well. If I could, I would just deal with them right away, but I keep having to hold back.”\n— That is a problem that the higher-ups should solve. We only do what we are instructed.\n“Okay. So what will our 2nd team do? Can you tell us where the target is heading?”\n— Wait up. Right now, the CCTV network of the road...\nTatatak!\nThe sound of hitting the keys could be heard.\n— Hm? No...\n“What is it?”\n— The target’s vehicle... is coming this way.\n“Huh? Then, they are heading to Jinan City Hall?”\nIt seemed like the altered voice was in the Jinan City Hall.\nThe voice immediately gave orders.\n— Finish cleaning up and immediately lead the 2nd team to Jinan city hall.\n“Yes.”\nJinan City Hall.\nWoong!\nThere was an uproar inside the City Hall building.\nThe staff on the general affairs department on the 20th floor came out and stared at someone in the waiting room.\n“Wah... that woman is an SS-class Gate Keeper right?”\n“She looks like an actress.”\nThe person they were looking at was the SS-class Gate Keeper, Yu So-hwa the Gravity Witch.\nIn a white blouse and black skirt, she looked like an actress who appears in dramas.\n“But isn’t that strange?”\n“She looks like an assistant.”\n“Ehh. No way.”\nShe was standing respectfully.\nDespite the empty chairs in the waiting room.\nBi Mak-heon, who was wearing a dark blue suit, was also standing.\n“He looks young?”\n“Who is he?”\nThey were all chatting about Chun Yeowun, the only one seated.\n“You must be famous.”\n“No, sir.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, Yu So-hwa responded bluntly.\nOf course, despite denying it, she couldn’t hide her red face, which was turning even redder due to the burdensome gazes.\nThis was her first time working as someone’s secretary.\nIt was then, someone came into the waiting room.\n“You must have waited long.”\nA man in his early forties.\nThe man was an assistant of the Mayor of Jinan, Sang Yeong.\n“The deputy Mayor and even the security chief wanted to join the meeting saying that the Gate Keeper was Miss Yu So-hwa, is that alright?”\nAt the question, Yu So-hwa looked at Chun Yeowun. When he nodded, she answered.\n‘Hmm... why is an SS class Keeper asking permission from Yongchun Group’s vice-chairman?’\nThe man was puzzled.\nHe knew who they were as he had to confirm their identities in advance. But he couldn’t understand why the woman wanted to have a private conversation with the Mayor of Jinan.\n“This way.”\nThe assistant led them to the office.\nAfter going through the hallway, he opened the door to the Mayor’s room.\nAs he said, in the Mayor’s office, there were three middle-aged men who looked like civil servants and two female secretaries in front of the desk.\n“Oh, I heard that today is a lucky day, but didn’t realize that I was lucky enough to meet the Gravity Witch.”\nA middle-aged man in an all brown suit, Jae-hyun, stood in front of the Mayor’s table.\nStanding to the right, was another middle-aged man with glasses and half parted hair. He was So Yang-hyeon, the head of security.\n“The new vice-chairman of Yongchun is also visiting the City Hall, this has to be really a nice day, Mayor.”\nWhile talking to the Mayor, the head of security smiled at Chun Yeowun.\nHe was trying to show a friendly attitude as he was receiving donations from the Group.\nChun Yeowun’s gaze was directed to the middle-aged man on the left side.\nHe was the deputy Mayor.\nHe had an unbalanced body shape. Unlike his pale and thin face, his body was pretty thick.\n‘Hm.’\n“Come on! Let’s talk there.”\nAt the Mayor’s words, they moved to a separate room.\nThe female secretaries served them hot tea.\nTak!\nAfter putting down the teacup, the secretaries returned to their seats, and Mayor Jae-hyun opened his mouth.\n“Okay. Can I know why I was asked for a private meeting?”\nSurprisingly, the Mayor seemed to be the kind that liked getting to the point right away.\nAfter all, he had a powerful position.\nBesides, there wasn’t much time because of the Gate Warning, which would soon be announced.\n“I think it would be better if you talk to the vice-chairman and not me. Mayor.”\n“Hm?”\nMayor Jae-hyun frowned.\nThe one who asked for the meeting was Yu So-hwa, but she asked him to speak with the vice-chairman.\n“The vice-chairman, why?”\n“I am now speaking as the secretary of the vice-chairman and not as a Gate Keeper.”\n“Secretary?”\nAll three of them were shocked.\nThe most famous Gate Keeper. It was natural that one would show such a reaction.\n“Huh. So..”\nAt that time, Chun Yeowun gestured to Bi Mak-heon, who placed the tablet PC on the table.\nOn the screen was a document.\n“What is that?”\n“Please take a look, Mayor.”\nAt Bi Mak-heon’s words, the Mayor tilted his head and then started to read the document.\nReading it, his expression hardened.\nWith a serious look, he asked.\n“Isn’t this a contract?”\nThe document was a contract.\nBut the problem was its content.\nMayor Jae-hyun asked in a displeased tone.\n“Is this the reason you asked for a private meeting? To get this approved?”\n“Mayor. What is it?”\nSo Yang-heyon asked what was going on, and the Mayor handed him the tablet PC.\nHis face contorted as well.\n“The Yongchun Group wants to sign a partnership agreement with Jinan City to participate in the Gate Defense Battle regardless of Murim registration?”\nEven those who sided with the Yongchun were shocked.\nThe contract asked for permission to independently participate in the Gate defense without being connected to the government.\nThe Yongchun group wasn’t registered in Murim Association, so in a Gate Defense War, they only get to play a defensive role and not an offensive one.\n“Look. Vice-chairman. Do you think I will approve this?”\nWhen Murim warriors register with the association, they have to follow the orders of the National Guard.\nIf they approved this, the Yongchun Group will cross the wall at will without relation to the government and engage in battle.\nAt the Mayor’s anger, Bi Mak-heon said.\n“Mayor. Please don’t overthink it. If you look at the contract, the partnership terms state that in case Jinan faces risk due to the Gate, the Yongchun group will protect you as a partner...”\nTak!\nThe Mayor pushed the tablet PC away and spoke in anger.\n“Don’t play with words. Protect? Even the government can’t allow this, and even if this is possible with the self-governing power of Jinan city. I don’t know what kind of power a single company has to...”\n“Do you think that we would make such an offer without the power to back it?”\nThe first time Chun Yeowun spoke.\nCreepy!\nIt was just simple words, but the Mayor went speechless.\nAn unknown feeling of intimidation was emanating from Chun Yeowun, which made his body tremble.\nThe aura of the strongest.\nChun Yeowun spoke.\n“You want proof of power? Mayor of Jinan.”\n“V-vice chairman, what are you talking about?”\nSo Yang-hyeon, the head of security, asked.\nLooking at So Yang-hyeon, Chun Yeowun asked.\n“If I kill all the murim warriors and Gate Keepers in Jinan, will that be enough proof for you?”",

      "content": "‘Euk!’\nBi Mak-heon, assistant manager of the vice-chairman, looked at Chun Yeowun with a puzzled expression.\nWhen he was asked to draft a contract, he had doubts whether it would work or not.\nHe knew that Chun Yeowun had something going on in his mind.\nHowever.\n‘This isn’t a negotiation...’\nThis was intimidation.\nBi Mak-heon knew who Chun Yeowun was, so it didn’t sound like nonsense to him.\nHowever, the Jinan city hall knew nothing about Chun Yeowun.\n‘Is this guy crazy?’\n‘I was concerned because he was a young vice-chairman...’\nAs expected, their expressions weren’t good.\nMayor Jae-hyun, an ordinary politician, was speechless at Chun Yeowun’s unique intimidation.\nBut Yang-hyeon got angry and jumped up from his seat.\n“Kill? What do you think you are saying in front of the Mayor who controls the whole Jinan city? No matter how much you want to show your power, do you think that it would be considered as a joke when you talk about killing government affiliated Gate Keepers and registered Murim warriors? Take your words back! vice-chairman.”\nAs a person with military power under him, he had the courage.\nThe air in the room turned cold.\nIt was safe to say that amicable negotiations were not possible anymore.\n‘I am pissed off. How can you avoid registering in Murim association by giving us donations and then say something like this?’\nSo Yang-hyeon shook his head.\nIt sounded absurd.\nHe thought that with the warning he gave, the talks would pass.\n“Joke? How funny! Do you think I can’t do that?”\nChun Yeowun didn’t intend to back down.\n‘M-my lord!’\nOnly BI Mak-heon was going crazy.\nThe relationship the company had with Jinan city hall was on the verge of being disturbed.\nThere was no way that Chun Yeowun didn’t understand that, but Bi Mak-heon still couldn’t figure out why he was coming out so strong.\n‘This...’\nAs expected, So Yang-hyeon’s face turned red with anger.\n“I don’t care how young you are, I never thought that a person in the position of vice-chairman would be this foolish. We will have a separate talk with the chairman of your company, I have nothing more to say to you.”\n“You haven’t signed the contract yet.”\n“I won’t!”\nSo Yang-hyeon was unable to tolerate Chun Yeowun’s words and shouted.\n“Call security! Call the guards right now and get them out...”\nThat was when deputy Mayor Mi-chuk interfered.\n“Wait.”\n“Deputy Mayor?”\n“Calm down chief So. Do you really want to sever our relationship with the Yongchun group when the Gate Warning is around the corner?”\nJinan city was in a state of tension.\nIt was because it was forecast that the Gate might be B-class or higher.\nThe barrier has already been breached by B-class and higher entities several times before.\nConsidering that, the Yongchun group, which played a defensive role from within the barrier, was a necessary force.\n“But deputy Mayor...”\n“Calm down and let me talk for a bit.”\n“Uhm.”\nAt those words, So Yang-hyeon went silent.\n‘Deputy Mayor Mi-chuk.’\nBi Mak-heon looked at him.\nFor a long time, their company had been trying to contact the prominent politicians in the city.\nHowever, this person couldn’t be reached.\nHe was the most influential politician in Jinan city, serving as the deputy Mayor for three consecutive times.\nMi-chuk looked at Chun Yeowun and said.\n“Because you are a young vice-chairman, you certainly say a lot. To annihilate all the warriors and Gate Keepers of Jinan City.”\n“Did that sound like a joke?”\nChun Yeowun’s voice was getting colder and colder.\nMi-chuk put his hand on his chin as he spoke with a serious look.\n“You seem to believe in something. If so, can you let us know what it is? A proposal without a vision won’t have the power to convince. Tell me what the Yongchun group can do to protect the city.”\nThe question was very cold.\nMayor Jae-hyun and even So Yang-hyeon nodded their heads at the deputy Mayor’s wise response and then looked at Chun Yeowun.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun’s answer was extremely unexpected.\n“My existence is the answer.”\n“What?”\nDeputy Mayor couldn’t believe his ears.\nHe expected to hear what kind of power was hidden within the company, but this answer was completely unrelated.\n“W-what. What absurd...”\nShhh!\nDeputy Mayor raised his hand and stopped So Yang-hyeon from speaking. He then added in a soft voice.\n“What is that supposed to mean vice-chairman?”\n“Exactly what you’ve heard. I am Jinan’s greatest strength.”\n“Ha!”\nSo Yang-hyeon had completely lost it.\nIn the end, they were back to the starting point.\nDeciding that he could no longer endure it, he wanted to call for security.\nWhen Mi-chuk said.\n“Then by strength, you mean your martial arts prowess?”\n“Yes.”\nMi-chuk went silent at Chun Yeowun’s affirmative answer.\nStroking his chin, he spoke again.\n“The world has changed a lot since the Gate opened. Warriors who transcend human limitations such as warriors and superpower holders have appeared.”\nAnd their participation in war made it easier for the humans to cope with the Gate.\nAmong the warriors transcending the limits of human beings, there were a few called the one-man army.\n“SS-class Gate Keeper, the Gravity Witch Yu So-hwa is a typical case. I might understand if it was her saying those words, but the young vice-chairman is...”\n“I am no match for him.”\nMi-chuk’s words were cut by Yu So-hwa.\nThe Mayor seemed shocked.\n“An SS-class keeper can’t compete with him?”\nSS-class Gate Keepers were the pinnacle and the strongest of all Gate Keepers.\nOne of them was enough to subdue a C-class Gate.\n“It makes no sense. To face an SS-class Keeper, the Murim warrior must be at least in the Tiger zodiac level...”\nDespite being an ordinary human, the head of security was well aware of the power levels in Murim.\nThe Five Strongest Warriors standing at the pinnacle of modern Murim were rumored to be at Tiger level.\nBut they were all over 60 years old.\n‘He is only in his early twenties and is claiming to be that strong?’\nA Tiger level warrior.\nThe strongest warriors.\nIf that was true, then the current Murim rankings would be overturned.\n“I-I can’t believe it.”\n“Chief So. I don’t think that this is a discussion fit for this room anymore.”\n“What do you propose?”\nDeputy Mayor spoke with a strange smile.\n“Isn’t there only one way? Let’s see if the vice-chairman can really prove his power.”\nNext to the city hall was a large dome-shaped stadium.\nIt was managed by the Murim of Jinan City hall.\nNobody expected the Mayor, who was busy with his meetings, to move to the place.\nChun Yeowun spoke.\n“Keep your word.”\n“The Mayor has already given his word. If the vice-chairman can prove his power, we will approve of the contract.”\n“Huh.”\nUnfortunately, the method to prove the power wasn’t suggested by Chun Yeowun.\nSince a Gate Warning was going to be issued, there was no way Jinan City wouldn’t accept more power.\nIt was a good opportunity to deal with all problems if Chun Yeowun really had that much power.\nWhile moving into the dome-shaped stadium, So Yang-hyeon said.\n“This is a place where the warriors of the city hall train, and they take the test to register themselves in the Murim association.”\nMurim registration was handled by the state.\nHowever, since it wasn’t possible for all warriors to come where the Murim Department of State Council was registered, Murim departments were established at each city hall.\n‘Test...’\nThe registered warriors were graded according to the standards of the Murim Association.\n“It was originally a test for Murim registration, but we will use it to measure the vice-chairman’s strength.”\nHis words reminded Chun Yeowun of his days in the academy.\nAt that time, he was given a plate for each stage.\n“Are you here?”\nAs they entered, a strong man in his mid-forties, who appeared to be an employee of the Murim department in city hall, approached and greeted the deputy Mayor.\n“Manager Oh, is everything ready?”\n“Yes. The moment I got the call, we got everything done.”\nThe man called manager Oh pointed to the right side of the place.\nOn the right side, eight layers of slabs were piled up. Each slab was 20cm thick.\n“That one...”\nBi Mak-heon knew what the blue color meant.\nManager Oh smiled and responded.\n“I see that you are a Murim warrior. That is sapphire.”\nSapphire, the blue stone, was much harder than ordinary stones and impossible to cut or break.\nSince old times, Murim people have used that to test their strengths.\nManager Oh stood in front of it and said.\n“There are four tests. Three basic measurements and one battle. We can conclude the level afterwards.”\nThe tests were prepared.\nManager Oh looked at Bi Mak-heon and said.\n“Okay. Move on to the first test.”\n“Ah... that will be done by our vice-chairman, not me.”\n“Huh? Weren’t you the vice-chairman?”\nManager Oh thought that Bi Mak-heon was the vice-chairman of the Yongchun group since he seemed older.\n“It is this person.”\nAs So Yang-hyeon’s words, manager Oh scratched his head with embarrassment.\n‘Hmm? Him?’\nIt was natural for manager Oh to be puzzled.\nChun Yeowun was nothing like a Murim warrior.\nHis internal energy didn’t seem that great either.\nHe was skeptical, but since he was a high-ranking man, and the deputy Mayor asked for it, manager Oh spoke with a calm face.\n“Haha, I made a mistake. The vice chairman is so young that I misunderstood. Hmm, let’s test it. I will show you an example.”\nManager Oh said while holding a sword and standing in front of the slab.\n“You can use any weapon you want. Because the stone is hard, the blade may be damaged. Look here.”\nWoong!\nBlue energy condensed on manager Oh’s hands.\nManager Oh created sword qi, placed it onto the sword and slammed it at the edge of the sapphire slab.\nSwash!\nThe sword had gone to one slab and a half.\nAt first glance, it didn’t look like much, but it was impressive.\nThe slab can only be cut down with sword qi.\n“Ah!”\nBi Mak-heon exclaimed.\nHe didn’t expect the Murim department to have such a strong person.\nManager Oh put the weapon on the shelf and said.\n“Okay. Do it like this. You need to be Snake level (End of Super Master level) to cut one slab.”\nSince he thought that he did a good job with it, manager Oh looked proud.\n“For reference, the chairman of Six Essence, the best in Jinan, could cut up to five.”\nSix Essence was the subsidiary of Blade.\nIn other words, a member of the Blade God Six Martial clan.\n“He got Dragon level.”\nThat meant he was at the beginning of the Superior Master level.\nSarcastically, So Yang-hyeon said.\n“The vice-chairman can cut down six or seven.”\nAnd if he couldn’t do that, that meant that he was bluffing.\nManager Oh stepped away and pointed to the slab.\n“Okay. Try it. The sword... uh?”\nChun Yeowun passed him and stood in front of the slabs. Without any weapons.\n‘Is he going to cut the slabs without any weapons?’\nManager Oh couldn’t hide his shock.\nIf that was the case, it meant the man could use sword qi with bare hands.\nIn other words, Chun Yeowun had to be Superior Master or above to do it.\n“Come to think of it, I don’t think I have ever done this in the academy.”\n“Huh?”\n“What is the point of breaking a stone?”\nTik!\nChun Yeowun placed his hand on the middle stone.\nThere was a gleam in manager Oh’s eyes.\nHe wasn’t sure what Chun Yeowun was planning to do without even raising his qi.\nIt was then.\nCrack!\n“Ugh!”\nThe moment Chun Yeowun touched the stone, a crack appeared from above.\n‘W-what?’\nAnd then Chun Yeowun slowly lowered his hand from the top slab to the bottom without lifting it, as if playing with mud.\nKwakwakwa!\nChun Yeowun’s hand smashed the slabs and rested on the floor.\n‘!!!’\nEveryone was shocked.\nAll the people who belonged to the Murim department were astonished.\nSo Yang-hyeon was no exception.\n‘No... No way!’\nManager Oh stood agape while looking at the shards of sapphire slabs that were crushed down like cookies.\nHe had done a lot of tests in his life, but this was something he saw for the first time.\n‘He didn’t even use sword qi and just crushed them with internal energy...’\nHe couldn’t make a proper assessment as Chun Yeowun’s methods weren’t normal.\nAll the slabs were crushed down by the pressing energy which came down from above.\nChun Yeowun laughingly said.\n“Test? You people are funny. This is such a silly joke.”\n“Joke?”\n“What do you do with this? Wood, tile, stone... sapphire. Cutting and breaking an object. The opponent can’t even resist as it isn’t alive.”\nWith those words, he lightly swung his hand.\nSlash!\nThe sword went right for the target and split the slab.\nThud!\nThe split slab fell on the ground.\nIt wasn’t sword qi or energy.\n‘W-what was that?’\nManager Oh was so shocked that he was at a loss for words.\nChun Yeowun turned to manager Oh and asked.\n“Are you the one who will fight with me?”\n‘!?’\nGulp!\nManager Oh’s face turned pale at that question.",

      "content": "‘Battle!’\nManager Oh, whose face turned white, couldn’t open his mouth.\nHe had just witnessed an unbelievable sight right before his eyes. It was difficult to even dare imagine the level of internal energy one would need to crush the sapphire slabs by just pressing them down.\n‘Is he really Tiger level?’\nManager Oh then came to a realisation.\nHe actually had never met a Supreme Master. So considering that the strongest warrior in the city could only cut down five slabs, this man in front of him must be a monster.\n“Who will fight against me?”\nChun Yeowun asked again.\n“... Chief, this man is a true strong warrior. There is no one here who can deal with him.”\nIn response, manager Oh revealed the blunt truth.\nIf the man was on an equal level, then he would have tried to battle him.\nHowever, even he, the leader of the Murim department, wouldn’t ever dare fight this monster. It felt stupid to even think about it.\n“What do you mean? Aren’t you exaggerating? He only did one test!”\nSo Yang-hyeon, the head of security, questioned.\nHe had, of course, seen the sapphire slabs being crushed down in front of his eyes.\nHowever, from an ordinary person’s standpoint, he didn’t quite understand why the examiner would let him pass without making him go through all the tests.\n“Chief.... Don’t you know who the most talented person in Murim is?”\n“I’m saying this because I do! But without completing all the tests, how can you rate the vice-chairman?”\nThere was only one thing Sa Yang-hyeon wanted to know. Was the arrogant vice-chairman really that talented?\n‘If that’s the case, the Yongchun group will get to write the contract the way they want.’\nThe current Murim warriors were controlled by the government.\nHowever, if a Murim group were to rise in power and have equal strength to the government, it would be bad.\n“Is there anyone who would like to take the test?”\nSo Yang-hyeon shouted and asked the people in the stadium.\nHowever, no one came forward.\nManager Oh was displeased with it.\n“We all saw the strength of Yongchun Group’s vice-chairman. It is ...”\n“Is it fine if I try?”\nAt that moment, someone interrupted him.\nManager Oh looked puzzled at the person.\n“Officer Ji?”\nIt was Ji Hun-tak, a new office member who was recently assigned to the Murim department.\nHe knew that he was a Master level warrior in his early thirties, but Manager Oh couldn’t understand what he was trying to do.\n“Sigh. This isn’t your time.”\n“You need to let me try to know.”\n‘Officer Ji, this person.’\nHe couldn’t tell when he was acting and when he wasn’t.\nWhat he couldn’t really understand was how Ji Hun-tak seemed obviously excited despite seeing the sapphire slabs get crushed.\n“Manager Oh. Give me a chance. Who would want to miss this opportunity to compete with such a strong warrior?”\nWhile saying those words, Ji Hun-tak’s eyes were looking elsewhere.\nManager Oh, who didn’t notice it, shook his head and said.\n“Sigh, act your level. Do you know what bullshit is coming out of your mouth right now? The opponent you have...”\nIt was then.\nPhat!\nJi Hun-tak’s form suddenly appeared in front of Manager Oh.\n“Huh?”\nHis movement was so incredibly fast for a Master level.\nFlustered, he tried to step back, but Ji Hun-tak caught up to him and starched his hand towards his abdomen.\nPush! Push!\n“Kuak!”\nThe sound of something being fired was heard.\nManager Oh took a few steps back and looked at his stomach.\n“You, what are..”\nHis stomach was stained with blood as if he had been hit by a bullet.\nHe wasn’t able to tell what had just happened.\n“Phew. Just die.”\nThere was something sticking out of his palm, and smoke was rising from it.\n“Of... officer... Ji... what the...”\nPush!\nAt that moment, a hole was formed in manager Oh’s forehead.\nIt was a bullet that Ji Heon-tak fired.\n“You crazy bastard!”\n“Officer Jiiii!”\nAn unexpected turn of events.\nFurious, the staff of the Murim department rushed to him and tried to subdue him.\nAt that moment, something utterly unforeseen happened.\nPush!\n“Kuak!”\n“Uhk!”\n‘?! ?!’\n“Kuak!”\nAll of a sudden, those who were supposed to be the stadium employees suddenly started to attack the Murim department workers.\nLike JI Heon-tak, they started to fire bullets using silencers. They aimed for the vital points of the Murim department staff and killed them.\n“W-what the hell...”\nSo Yang-hyeon, the head of security, couldn’t hide his shock.\nHe couldn’t grasp the situation.\nIn an instant, all Murim warriors were killed right before his eyes.\n“What are you up to?”\nSo Yang-hyeon wasn’t dumb.\nHe didn’t remember every member of the city hall, but he could make out those who weren’t.\n‘Did terrorists enter the city hall?’\n20 people.\nConfused, he spoke in a low voice to deputy Mayor Mi-chuk, who was next to him.\n“Deputy Mayor. I think we need to get out of here...”\nClank!\n‘!?’\nSo Yang-hyeon’s eyes widened.\nSomething hard suddenly touched his head.\nAs he slowly turned his head, he saw the deputy Mayor was aiming a gun at him.\n“Deputy... deputy Mayor?”\nSo Yang-hyeon was shocked.\nHe never thought that the deputy Mayor would be one of the terrorists.\nAnd then, the deputy Mayor spoke.\n“What about the CCTV?”\n/strong>\nOne of those who attacked the Murim staff answered.\n“All taken care of.”\n“Good.”\nAt that, So Yang-hyeon’s gaze naturally turned to the CCTV camera hanging on the stadium.\nIf they were operating normally, there should be a red dot blinking, but it was off.\n‘No way...’\nSo Yang-hyeon looked at the deputy Mayor with trembling eyes.\nHe never imagined that Mi-chuk would be one of them.\n“Deputy Mayor...”\n“Shhh.”\nMi-chuk put his index finger on his lips and, as a gesture to be quiet.\nAnd then spoke to Chun Yeowun.\n“How unexpected. I heard that you were an S-class, but I didn’t expect you were actually this strong.”\nMi-chuk was genuinely admiring him.\nHe continued to talk while looking at the exclusive secretary Yu So-hwa.\n“The plan changed due to the variable, the SS-class Gate Keeper, but my decision wasn’t wrong.”\n“Deputy Mayor, what is this?”\nYu So-hwa asked him.\nMi-chuk replied as if he was really sorry.\n“Well, I feel bad that you got involved in this. I didn’t think that an SS-class Gate Keeper would be our target.”\n“Target?”\n“Don’t worry, we will put your body to good use. It is rare to get a chance to hold the body of an SS-class Gate Keeper.”\nYu So-hwa’s eyes narrowed. She looked around at the enemies.\n“You think you can stop us?”\nYu So-hwa wriggled her fingers to activate her ability. She was planning on crushing them at once.\nClank!\nAt that time, the deputy Mayor placed the gun closer to the head of security.\n“Wouldn’t it be better if you don’t move?”\n“Kuak!”\nBi Mak-heon, who was near Chun Yeowun, frowned.\nThe deputy Mayor was holding the head of the security and using him as a threat.\nIf the head of security was lost, then all the work that the Yongchun group did to make him on their side would turn to waste. And if he died, then their hard work and donations would be for nothing.\n“Did you get a lot from the Yongchun group? Chief So.”\n“De-deputy Mayor...”\nDeputy Mayor had served for three terms in Jinan.\nOf course, he was aware of it.\n[Vice-chairman. So Yang-hyeon, the head of security, our company has invested a lot in him.]\nBi Mak-heon sent a telepathic message to Chun Yeowun.\nHe wanted to tell that So Yang-hyeon couldn’t die.\nAt that moment, another person appeared on the second floor of the stadium’s railing and jumped to the ground.\n“You just made it on time. 2nd team.”\n1st and 2nd team, each team seemed to have 10 people.\nIt seemed like this was a gang.\nThe man wearing a black hat and a burberry coat, standing on the arched railing, looked like a leader.\n“It is a little late to deal with those here.”\nAs he said, the stadium was silent.\nDeputy Mayor smiled and spoke to Chun Yeowun.\n“I don’t know why I had to come all the way here to City Hall and do this. but let’s just get this done.”\nClank!\n“Huh!”\nSo Yang-hyeon was startled by the way the gun was moved. The deputy Mayor smiled and continued.\n“How about this scenario? The vice-chairman of the Yongchun group was dissatisfied with the registration of Murim warriors. In the Mayor’s office, he even made a radical remark as to killing all the Murim warriors and Gate Keepers. Yes, that sounds good. Huhuhu.”\n‘!?’\nSo Yang-hyeon’s face turned white.\nUntil recently, he was only a hostage, but now his death was confirmed.\nIt wasn’t something that the deputy Mayor he served would be saying.\n“Okay. Then.”\nShhh!\nThe deputy mayor raised his hand.\nSeeing that, those who were at the stadium surrounded Chun Yeowun, Yu So-hwa and Bi Mak-heon.\nMi-chuk had an expression full of satisfaction.\n‘Let’s see how well the modified humans can deal with class A hazard entity...’\nSmile.\nThat was when Chun Yeowun laughed.\nIt was close to a sneer.\n‘What? That attitude?’\nHe seemed to have no idea as to what kind of a situation he was in.\nThe superiors said that these were modified humans created to deal with A-class alpha entities.\nThey said they could handle even an S-class target.\n‘Ignorant!’\nChun Yeowun said.\n“It was worthwhile to wait for tests and all that, but I guess it was useless in the end.”\n“What?”\n“Did you think that I didn’t know about you trying to waste time?”\n“What are you talking about...”\nIt was then.\nThe figure of Chun Yeowun, who was surrounded by modified humans, disappeared.\n‘Huh?’\nShhh!\n“What the?”\nSuddenly, he stood right in front of Mi-chuk.\nPak!\n“Uhhh!”\nChun Yeowun slammed the head he caught down to the floor.\nBang!\n“Kuak!”\nHe slammed it so hard that its half was stuck in the floor.\nAs Mi-chuk struggled to get away, he heard Chun Yeowun’s cold voice.\n“Thank you for moving the way that I thought you would.”\n‘!?’\n“You just gave me a nice reason to kill you with my own hands.”\nHearing that, Mi-chuk’s eyes fluttered.\n‘T-this bastard... he just let everyone in the Murim department die?’\nIt was ridiculous.\nIn the end, he wasn’t the one who wrote the screenplay.",

      "content": "“How dare you!”\n“Get your hands off him!”\nWhen their boss was harmed, three members dressed as the city hall employees, tried to run towards Chun Yeowun.\nHowever, they ended up overlooking another monster.\nYu So-hwa reached her hand to them.\nBang!\n“Euk!”\n“M-my body!”\nWhen they fell down, the floor beneath them cracked for around 2 meters, and their lower bodies pierced into it.\nThere was a gleam in her eyes.\nShe was going to kill them by crushing them with strong pressure at once. However, their bodies were stronger than she thought, so they were still alive, just stuck.\n“She is the Gravity Witch. Don’t stay in groups. Spread out!”\n“Yes!”\nAt the cry of the man who was wearing a black hat, the leader of the 2nd team, the members spread out away from her.\n‘Vice-chairman?’\nChun Yeowun noticed how Bi Mak-heon and Yu So-hwa looked at him.\n“Kill them all.”\n“Yes.”\n“Yep!”\nAs if waiting for Chun Yeowun’s order, the two of them immediately began to hunt the members who targeted them.\nAs the battle between the two sides started, the Deputy mayor asked Chun Yeowun in doubt.\n“... since when were you suspicious?”\n“From the beginning.”\n“What?”\nChun Yeowun felt that something weird, an energy he wasn’t aware of, was there when he first entered the mayor’s office.\nObviously, the deputy Mayor wasn’t a Murim warrior who had mastered his internal energy.\nAnd he didn’t seem like an ordinary human, the energy inside him was different.\nHowever, he realized that many people with similar kinds of energy were not just within the room, but throughout the entire Jinan City Hall.\nAnd thanks to the car that tailed them, he was convinced.\n‘It was because of that?’\nMi-chuk led Chun Yeowun right into the stadium, where people with similar energy were gathered.\nAnd that couldn’t be a coincidence.\n“Did you think that I wouldn’t know about your stupid tricks”\nBang!\n“Kuak!”\nChun Yeowun slammed Mi-chuk’s head down once more. And then asked.\n“Who sent you?”\nChun Yeowun was sure that the deputy Mayor wasn’t the mastermind.\nHe had nothing to do with Chun Yeowun till today.\n“Say it.”\nGrab!\n“Kuak!”\nMi-chuk shuddered at Chun Yeowun’s coldness, as he was crushing him to the floor without mercy.\n‘Who the hell is he?’\nRather, he had questions to ask.\nNot only did Chun Yeowun reverse the plan he had dug, but he also created enough trouble for him and the other people.\nSomething that ordinary people couldn’t imagine.\n‘Isn’t he supposed to be the vice-chairman of Yongchun? He is like the devil...’\nBang!\n“Kuak!”\nHe knew nothing about Chun Yeowun. All he knew was that the man was a villain.\nThen, suddenly something flashed in Mi-chuk’s mind.\n‘Villain... ah!’\nSo Yang-heon, the head of security.\nSince he was saved from being shot, he must have heard what Chun Yeowun said.\nAnd he spoke.\n“Kuak, even though you are pretending to be smart, there isn’t much you can do.”\n“...?”\n“You made a grave mistake.”\n“Mistake?”\n“haha, didn’t you let the head of security listen to all your words? He knows that you deliberately let the Murim department staff die, can you keep him alive? Of course not. You created a problem ...”\n“You idiot.”\n“What?”\nGrab!\n“Ugh!”\nChun Yeowun grabbed his face.\n‘What!?’\nHe lifted the deputy Mayor’s upper body, and he saw the head of security on the floor.\n“Did you think I’ll be as sloppy like you?”\nIt was Chun Yeowun who sealed the blood points of So Yang-hyeon right away.\nIf he passed out right away, what could he have heard?\n“W-when?”\nBang!\n“Kuak!”\nAgain, his head was slammed into the floor.\nChun Yeowun shook his head and muttered.\n“You are quite strong.”\nChun Yeowun, who wanted to know the identity of the mastermind, thought of killing the others after hitting Mi-chuk.\nHowever, Mi-chuk didn’t faint despite his head being banged on the floor several times.\nGrab!\n‘His body is unusual.’\nHe had been battling numerous enemies, and it wasn’t his first time facing someone with a strong body.\nThe muscles of the neck were thick, and the head was hard.\nTak! Tak!\nChun Yeowun tried to stun him by sealing the blood points.\n‘Hm?’\nHowever, their sealing locations were utterly different from those of ordinary people.\nLike they weren’t human.\nMi-chuk said while laughing at Chun Yeowun.\n“Kukuku. No matter what you use, you can’t stun me! Our bodies are different from normal humans.”\nHe was undoubtedly looking proud.\n“And... Do you have time to keep focusing on me?”\nMi-chuk’s eyes shone.\nIt was then.\nPhat!\n“Uhmp!”\n“Die!”\nFrom the left and right of Chun Yeowun, two people rushed in with lightning-like movements.\nDespite not being warriors, their movements were on the same level as Super master level warriors.\nClang!\nBlades were protruding from their fists.\nThey remodeled their bodies and hid weapons inside them.\n‘Got you.’\nMi-chuk smiled.\nThe blades weren’t simple weapons.\nIt was a super blade made by a special alloy to deal with A-class Alpha entities.\nIt had the kinetic energy which could even tear down the sword qi.\nWoong!\nThe reason their blades looked to be several was because they were vibrating.\n‘You can’t stop them!’\nThere was a reason why Mi-chuk was proud of himself.\nIt was because most people do not know of the super-vibrating tech, which wasn’t yet released to the public or commercialized.\nWhether it was Chun Yeowun or not, he was sure that the man would fall.\nChun Yeowun stretched out both of his hands.\n“This is interesting.”\n‘!?’\nAt that moment, the two people who were running at him, knelt to the floor before they could touch him.\nBang!\n“Euk!”\n“M-my body!”\nFlustered that they were pressed down to the ground, they tried to use their vibrating swords and move.\nKang!\n“Ah?”\nThe sharp energy suddenly broke through their swords and pierced their foreheads.\nPuck!\n“Kuak!”\nThe scream of death, and the two fell down to the floor.\n“N-No way!”\nMi-chuk shouted in shock.\nThe ultra-vibrating sword that couldn’t be broken, broke.\nSince he wasn’t a warrior, Mi-chuk didn’t understand what happened, but even warriors would have been shocked if they had witnessed it.\nIt was the invisible sword that pierced their heads.\nAnd only those who reached the Divine Master level could actually be capable of doing that.\n“That vibration is still insufficient to be called ultra-vibration.”\nMi-chuk’s eyes widened.\nFor a moment, he thought that his ears heard it wrong.\n“Ultra-vibration tech?”\nThis was a tech that wasn’t commercialized yet.\nIt was supposed to be their own unique weapon, but Chun Yeowun knew what it was.\nChun Yeowun didn’t respond to that.\n“This is ultra-vibration.”\nShhh!\nA single invisible sword was formed in Chun yeowun’s hand.\nTsutsustsus!\nIt left several afterimages because of how quickly it moved.\n“No way!”\nIt really was ultra-vibration.\nIt was what Chun Yeowun called, Ultra-vibrating Invisible Sword.\n“It is a precious skill for you people, but this is how you use it.”\nChun Yeowun reached out somewhere.\nShhh!\nThe sword flew in that direction.\nIt was the place where his members were fighting with the Gravity Witch.\n“Noo!”\nBewildered, Mi-chuk shouted, but it was too late.\nWhop!\n“Kuk!”\nThe invisible sword pierced the head of the man who was fighting with the SS-class Keeper.\nThe sword didn’t stop there.\nAs if it had a life of its own, it kept changing its direction and pierced the heads of all the opponents.\n“No. what the hell are...”\nPuck!\n“Kuak!”\nIn the meantime, another person died.\nHaving been struck with fear, people moved away from each other and began to shout!\n“Stop it!”\n“H-how do you stop that?”\nThey couldn’t understand it.\nJust an invisible sword was strong enough, and this one was an ultra-vibrating invisible sword.\n‘Damn it!’\nIf it couldn’t be stopped, there was only one way.\nThe leader of the 2nd team, the man in black hat, shouted.\n“Everyone, spread out and run away!”\nPhat!\nEveryone scattered at once and tried to escape.\nAnd that was when Yu So-hwa took the lead.\n“Who said you could leave?”\nThe moment she touched the floor, the whole place turned zero gravity.\nAnd the bodies floated up.\nFloat!\n“Uagh!”\n“T-this!”\nPeople were shocked.\nChun Yeowun smiled at her and mumbled.\n“She was worth it.”\nHe then waved his hand.\nSwoosh!\nThe invisible sword suddenly started to move again and aimed at the floating people.\nPuck! Puck!\nThis time, there was no scream. The corpses just floated in the weightless space.\n“Sun-gun! Escape!”\nMi-chuk yelled out someone’s name.\nBut.\n“Kuak!\"\nThe man with the black hat, leader of the 2nd team, Sun-gun, was also unable to avoid the invisible sword and died.\nEven though all of them had their bodies enhanced and equipped with excellent weapons, they were slaughtered.\n‘I-is this an S-class target?’\nNo, it couldn’t be.\nMi-chuk couldn’t stop his trembling body.\n‘To get rid of this absurd monster.’\nHe was resenting the superior who gave him the orders.\nIt was then.\nSwwosh!\n“Euk!”\nThe sword that had killed everyone, flew in front of him and stopped.\nChun Yeowun spoke.\n“You must have waited for a long time, now it is your turn.”\nTak!\nWith those words, Chun Yeowun grabbed his sword and cut off Mi-chuk’s right arm.\n‘?!’\n“Kuaaak!”\nMi-chuk, whose arm was severed, screamed in agony.\nWithout even changing his expression, Chun Yeowun said.\n“How many limbs do I have to cut before you start speaking?”\n‘!!!’\nMi-chuk’s eyes grew big like they would burst, as he stared at the invisible sword.",

      "content": "So Yang-hyeon, the head of Jinan security, whose blood points were released, sincerely thanked Chun Yeowun for saving his life.\n“Thank you. Thank you so much. If it wasn’t for the vice-chairman, I don’t know what these terrorists could have done to the city hall.”\nActually, it wasn’t Jinan City Hall’s fault.\nWho could even imagine that the person who served as the deputy Mayor’s office for three years was actually a member of an unknown organization. No one could.\nHowever, it helped Chun Yeowun.\n“Contract approval? Hm. Of course, it will go through.”\nHis life was saved, there was no way they would refuse it.\nIn addition, although manager Oh was dead, he did say that Chun Yeowun was a Murim warrior at a higher level.\n“Hmm, I wonder how to fix this.”\nThe place was a mess.\nThere was blood all over the place, and the bodies of the dead Murim department were scattered everywhere.\nSo Yang-hyeon had seen the mess unfold.\nBut.\n“The deputy Mayor and the corpses of those damn peop...”\nThe bodies all melted as if they were dipped in sulfuric acid.\nThankfully, no trace was left.\nNo matter how unfavourable it was, Chun Yeowun couldn’t prevent the bodies from melting.\n“Well, don’t worry. Vice-chairman. With my own two eyes, I saw what they were doing.”\nSo Yang-hyeon assured him.\nAs a result, no damage would come to Chun Yeowun.\n“It is a pity that we didn’t find out who was behind these guys. In any case, the documents will be approached by the Mayor and emailed to your company by today.”\nChun Yeowun and the others left the rest of work to So Yang-hyeon and went away.\nAs soon as they came out, Chun Yeowun spoke to Bi Mak-heon.\n“I want names of organizations which start with the letter M. And they need to be related with technology.”\n“Alright.”\nBefore his body melted, the only word that the deputy Mayor said was M.\nWhen both his arms got cut, he tried to say something.\nHis body began to melt before that, though.\n‘Even the world with great technology is a mess.’\nWith the development of science, the tech was definitely superior to Murim.\nAnd it was certain that the deputy Mayor and the others were nothing different from consumables.\nSince they were attempting to assassinate without leaving any evidence.\n‘And aiming for me...’\nChun Yeowun’s lips turned into a smile.\nAt this point, there was only one person who would come after him.\n‘Chun Woo-kyung.’\nIt was certain.\nChun Yeowun was disappointed.\nHe thought the people leading the Sky Demon Order would be strong and fight their opponents head-on, but he never expected them to hide behind others.\n‘Someone like him was trying to be the Lord by impersonating the swords...’\nThe man had crossed a line he should never have.\nChun Yeowun moved to the parking lot.\nWheeing! Wheeing!\nA siren sounded.\nA siren echoed throughout the city.\n“Gate Warning!”\nBi Mak-heon said shocked.\nThe Gate Warning was supposed to go off today or tomorrow, but this was unfortunate timing.\nTheir contract with Jinan city was just done.\nChun Yeowun looked northeast.\n‘It’s different.’\nThis energy was different from the energy he felt at the first Gate.\nThe strong energy wave stimulated all his senses.\nSimilar time.\nBeep! Beep! Beep!\nAn alarm sounded in the monitoring room of the defense bureau of Jinan city.\n“Major Wei!”\nThe person shouted at the person called Major Wei Hun.\n“Has it opened? It is faster than I was told!”\nHe felt it every time, but the timing of the Gate opening was too irregular this time.\nWei Hun asked while looking at the monitor.\n“Where?”\n“N-No way...”\nThe lieutenant, who checked the location, was unable to speak.\n“Coordinates are 36°44’29.0\"N 117°11’51.9\"E... right in front of the 20th barrier on the northern east side of G-13.”\n“What?”\nWoong!\nThe entire room turned chaotic.\nThere was a simple reason as to why they were surprised.\nIt was because the Gate, which should have opened 3 Km away from the defense wall, was opening right in front of it.\n“GE wave activation 37% progressed.”\nWheeing! Wheeeing!\nBefore long, the wave alarm began to resound.\nIn a location that close, citizens in the northeast had to be evacuated right away.\nThe Major, who was flustered, immediately gave his orders.\n“Send the Jinan City into defense. Inform the commander-in-chief of this and inform the guards to be on standby.”\n“Yes!”\nFortunately, the Gate Warning was issued during the day, so many military people would be on duty. It was lucky that the National Guard was stationed in the north east preparing in advance.\nHowever, the location where the Gate opened is so close that the probability of the wall being broken was high.\nIf that happens, there would be human casualties.\n“Contact the Public Security Bureau, the Jinan Municipal Murim Association and the Gate Keepers.”\nThey were all looking at the GE wave activation, which was rising rapidly.\n‘We should hope they get there in time.’\nThe location of the Gate was too close to the city.\nTime was short.\nIn addition, the National Guards would need time to set their tanks and artillery.\n“Major Wei, look at this!”\nAt the scream, he looked at the screen.\nPick!\nSomething was moving rapidly from wall G-17. It has developed muscles and blue skin with a height of about 5 meters.\nIt was a two-legged and four-armed entity.\nThe moment he saw it, Major Wei muttered.\n“No way... it can’t be that!”\n“Shivara!”\nOne of the soldiers monitoring shouted.\nShivara.\nA four-armed hazard entity that got its name from the God Shiva, a Hindu God of destruction.\nHowever, the reason they were shocked wasn’t because of the entity.\n“A... A class...”\nGiven their appearances and the well-suited names, the hazard entities were A class.\nThey were more intelligent than the other ones and more beastly. T\nThere were only five cities in the entire world that managed to destroy a Shivara.\nIt wasn’t A class for nothing.\n“This is insane. A class?”\nThis was the worst.\nThey were told that the entity would be B class or higher.\nBut they didn’t think it would be a Shivara.\nJinan City had a better defense than other cities, but an A-class was too much.\nBang!\nAt that time, a cannon was fired at the Shivara.\nWhen the explosion occurred, the camera shook.\nWith the Gate opening right in front of the wall, it was natural for the defense forces in there to respond quickly.\n“It started.”\nLieutenant Cha Seon-kyung said in a serious voice.\nIt was a dangerous situation because the Gate Warning was already issued, but the Murim warriors or the Gate Keepers hadn’t gone there.\nBesides, there was another huge problem.\n“If it is Shivara, then it is Alpha...”\nFlash!\nAt that moment, about five screens of cameras installed on the wall turned blank simultaneously.\nThey looked at the G-17 barrier camera, which was on the main screen.\nThud! Thud!\nA huge six-armed entity could be seen approaching from within the smoke.\n“No...”\nAn elevated road not far northeast of Jinan.\nMany vehicles were leaving that place because of the Gate Warning, which caused traffic jams.\nOriginally, people in the vicinity of the wall would be evacuated, but the citizens were given a message to move to the southwest quickly.\nHorn!\nThe horn sounding on the roads was loud.\nIt wasn’t easy to let the vehicles of Public Security move with the huge traffic.\n“Shit! Get out of the way quickly!”\n“What are you doing! Move the car!”\nPeople opened their windows and screamed out loud.\nIf all the roads were 4 or 5 lanes, it would have been nice, but there were only 1 or 2 lanes roads, which made the path clogged.\nIn addition, some people were anxious and ended up bumping into another car, which made things even worse.\n“We might die here!”\n“What are the traffic police doing?”\nCitizens were running around.\nVehicles were coming from the opposite direction, and everyone was in a panic.\nAnd then came the buses, those people who recognized it, screamed and cheered.\n“Gate Keepers!”\n“Woah!!”\nThe bus was carrying the Gate Keepers.\nIn addition, several SUVs had Murim Association marks on it.\nThey were the Gate Keepers and Murim warriors who headed to the wall after receiving the emergency call.\nRrng!\nAnd their vehicles moved very fast.\nIn the driver seat of a black SUV.\nA bald middle-aged man with a beard, holding the steering wheel with one hand and phone in the other, asked.\n“What do you mean? We aren’t that far.”\nAt this question, an altered voice came from the other side.\n-A class... I mean, this situation doesn’t seem that good right now.\n“How did the 1st and 2nd team get hit? Wasn’t the purpose of those people to support us and get us the cores?”\nIt was natural to be nervous.\nIt was because an A-class entity had appeared.\nAnd an A-class hazard entity was an Alpha. The cores of such entities could only be gotten when the entire team worked together, but two teams were already annihilated.\nAccomplishing the mission was difficult.\n-Hmm, it seems like the information we received from the client is wrong. We will have to resolve the problem later, and this mission will have to be done by just the 3rd team.\n“Proceed with the 3rd team? Ha!”\nThe man was shocked.\nHow could the 3rd team deal with an A-class alpha entity?\nRather, it would give the Gate Keepers and the Murim Association a chance to get the core.\n-Yes. 2 out of the 3 teams were missing, so it is a mess here, please understand.\n‘What kind of bullshit is that?’\nFor a moment, he was furious and decided not to respond.\nHe was aware of the fact that he would withdraw from the organization at any time.\nAs he said nothing, the altered voice continued.\n-Gan-ong, your team members have learned martial arts, so you might be able to work with the Murim people and look for a chance.\n“Look for a chance?”\n-After all, we will finish this mission and dispatch new ones to Jinan City. So, for the time being, go along with them. We only have one goal anyways.\nAt those words, Gan-ong asked.\n“... are you talking about the core?”\n-If the Murim Association gets the core, seize it. they will be invested in dealing with it, and when they face the Alpha head-on, preserve the power, and stay alert...\nIt was then.\nKwang!\nAn explosion occurred on the other side of the road.\nGan-ong’s expression turned still.\nHe had another 15 minutes to reach the northeast wall, so why the explosions?\nThe explosion seemed to be because of vehicles.\n“Kyaaal!”\n“RUN!”\nOn the side of the road filled with smoke, people were running away.\nIn addition, the Gate Keepers bus, which was moving ahead, and all the vehicles behind it, stopped.\n-Gan-ong! Gan-ong!\nGan-ong didn’t respond.\nHis eyes trembled as he looked at the being which appeared through the smoke.\nThud! Thud! Thud!\nBlue skin and four arms.\n“Shivara!”\nA 4-meter long Shivara stepped on and pushed a car aside. It then began slaughtering people at random.\n“Barrier was breached!”\nIt has been just 20 minutes since the Gate Warning went off.\nAnd the worst has happened.\nIn addition to the one on the road, hundreds of Shivara jumped from here and there.\n“Fellow Murim Association members! They need to be stopped now!”\n“Gate Keepers! All out!”\nThey weren’t in a situation to head to the wall.\nIf they left it as it is, the citizens would be slaughtered.\nWarriors and Gate Keepers got out of their vehicles and tried to cross the road.\nIt was then,\nShhh!\nSomething came flying from the southwest.\nThe eyes of fleeing citizens, warriors and Gate Keepers turned there.\nSomething was coming in at an incredible speed and stopped in front of a rampaging Shivara.\nThud!\n“Person?”\nIt was when he stood that they saw it was a human.\nA man in black suit.\nThe warriors who were on the other side shouted.\n“H-he, Space Hover!”\nThe only way one could fly was Space Hover.\nIt was natural for the warriors to be shocked, as it was something that only a Supreme Master level person could do.\n-Gan-ong, what is happening?\nGan-ong pulled out a telescope from the car’s storage box and then looked at the person who appeared.\nGan-ong saw a young man with a white face and sharp knife-like eyes.\n“He is the one.”\n-The one?\n“The S class target!”\nChun Yeowun.\nUntil 30 minutes ago, Chun Yeowun was in Jinan city hall, and now he was in the northeast.\nBut the shock didn’t end there.\nChun Yeowun stretched out his hand in the air.\nIt was then.\nJjjhkkk!\nA thousand Ice Swords appeared in the sky.\n“This... what the...”\n“What is that?”\nNot just Gan-ong, but the warriors and Gate Keepers running towards Shivara looked at it with ridiculous expressions.\nThe thousand Ice Swords turned blue.\n“Sword qi!”\nNo martial artist wouldn’t know it.\nHaving sensed something unusual, the Shivara looked at the sky bewildered.\nBeep! Beep! Beep!\nHundreds of Shivara were marked with red crosses in Chun Yeowun’s eyes, who opened augmented reality.\n[Target Lock On! Target Lock On! Target Lock On!]\nWhen all Shivara were locked, Chun Yeowun clenched his fist.\n[Activating Sky Flash.]\nSwoosh!\nThousands of Ice Swords bombarded the Shivara like a meteor shower.\nKwakwakwakwang!",

      "content": "A ray of blue light fell from the sky.\nThe Murim warriors and the Gate Keepers were astonished at the marvelous sight.\nThe blue light spewing from the Ice Swords didn’t strike randomly, but precisely hit the Shivaras.\nKwakwakwakwang!\n“Kuak!”\n“Kaaakaka!”\nThe hazardous Shivaras were pierced by the swords and started to collapse one after the other.\n‘What the hell...’\nBaek Ye, the president of Six Essence, who was the branch manager of Jinan City’s Murim Association, couldn’t shut his mouth at the tremendous power.\n‘Air Swords!’\nIf he wasn’t mistaken, what his eyes had just seen were Air Swords.\nOnly those who reached the beginning of the Supreme Master level could unleash the Air Swords.\nIt also becomes possible for one to condense sword qi onto them.\nHowever.\n‘Is that even possible?’\nSuch a huge number of Ice Swords.\nEven a Supreme Master level could never use that large number of them, not to mention control them with just the fingers.\n“Chief Ji. Does this make sense?”\nJegal Bo-hyun, the chairman of the Jegal Cultural Foundation, who was standing next to him, looked in disbelief and asked.\n“Who the hell is he? Is he even human?”\nHwang Bo-yun, the president of HB Steel, couldn’t take his eyes off the man.\nThe members of the Murim Association were shocked at the words of the top three warriors of Jinan city.\nWoong!\n“Who the hell is that monster?”\n“I never saw him in the Murim Association.”\nPeople couldn’t help but be interested in Chun Yeowun.\nChun Yeowun, who extended his fist, spread open his palm.\nAnd.\nChachachang!\nThe Ice Swords floating in the air soon shattered and disappeared.\nThe meteor shower ended as if it had never happened.\nThe four-lane road was overflowing with Shivara corpses.\n“Woah!”\nWithout even having to run for their lives, the people just stood there and watched everything unfold.\nThe faces, which were trembling in fear of being killed by the Shivara, were now stained with excitement.\nThey were taking videos with their phones.\n“Who is the man in the black suit?”\n“A Gate Keeper?”\n“No. He is wearing a suit?”\n“Can a warrior really do such things?”\nDespite it being a world in which Gates opened, there were only a few people who had actually seen the Murim warriors in battles.\nIt was natural for the citizens to be shocked.\n“President Baek. Is he a member of the Murim Association?”\nA man with long hair and goggles came up to Baek Ye, the branch manager of Jinan Murim Association, and asked him.\nThe man was called Ma Kang-cheom.\nA B-class Keeper and the leader of the 2nd platoon.\nSince the leader Ha Hyeong-gang had died and the entire 1st platoon was wounded, he was the next one in line to lead.\n“No. We don’t know about him.”\nAt Ma Kang-cheom’s question, Jegal Bp-hyun shook his head and answered.\nThere was no reason to deceive people and tell them that the man belonged to the Murim Association.\n“He is a real monster. Is it possible for a warrior to do such a thing? I think it would be possible for an S-class or SS-class Keeper. But a warrior...”\nMa Kang-cheom said.\nHwang Bo-yun clicked his tongue.\n‘An S-class Keeper is capable of that?’\nIt was absurd.\nHe wondered if even the Five Strongest Warriors, who were said to be the strongest in the modern Murim, would be capable of unfolding such a technique.\n‘Besides, any warrior would be exhausted after doing such a thing.’\nIt felt impossible to remain standing after unfolding such an absurd technique.\nBaek Ye, the branch manager, spoke after calming himself.\n“We should move to the barrier point right now. We’ll have to contact him later and find out when such a great warrior came to Jinan City.”\nTheir eyes were shining.\nJegal Bo-hyun answered.\n“Let’s not push it and head there now. President Baek.”\n“Sure.”\nHwang Bo-yun agreed.\nThey both were curious.\nA strong warrior at an unguessable level was participating in the war, so it was strange that president Baek didn’t care.\nIt was then.\nDrrrr!\n“What?”\n“The car is shaking?”\nThe cars on the road were shaking.\nThe shaking gradually spread more and more.\nGrrrrr!\n“E-earthquake!”\n“R-run away!”\nSurprised, the citizens thought that it was an earthquake.\nHowever, someone pointed to the northeast and shouted.\n“L-Look over there!”\nThud! Thuuu! Grrrrr!\nThe trees to the northwest were breaking down.\nThe bushes were swaying and the dust was rising as it kept moving towards the road.\nAnd then, something appeared from the thick bushes.\n“T-that is...”\n“Alpha Shivara!!!”\nThe Gate Keepers and the Murim warriors identified the monster right away.\nIt had a body full of muscles, sharp teeth like those of goblins, shining red eyes and six arms.\nIt looked like a normal Shivara and not at the same time.\nThe biggest difference was.\n“W-what size is that!”\nIt was so tall that it even exceeded the size of a giant tree.\nAt first glance, it looked to be 30 meters tall with a huge weight as the entire ground shook when it walked.\nBut that wasn’t the only problem.\nThey saw the other Shivara’s running in as the bushes swayed.\nAnd their number exceeded the last batch.\n“No...”\n“Was the barrier really breached?”\nThe warriors and Gate Keepers couldn’t hide their shock.\nAs if it wasn’t enough that the Gate opened right in front of the wall.\nIf the barrier was breached, more entities would come rushing into the city.\nIf that was to happen, even the Murim warriors and Gate Keepers wouldn’t be able to stop it.\n“Monsters are coming!”\n“Run away!”\n“Ackkk!”\n“Kyaaak!”\nThud! Thud!\nWith the appearance of the Alpha and the other Shivaras, the road turned chaotic once again.\nCitizens rushed out to the southwest side by driving their cars and hitting the other vehicles in the process.\nBaek Ye, the branch manager of Murim Association, shouted as he looked at the approaching Alpha.\n“Murim warriors, listen! If we don’t defend the city, our Jinan city will be destroyed by the entities which come in from the Gate!”\n“Right! We need to stop the Alpha right now!”\nThat was their only hope.\nOnly defeating the Alpha and closing the Gate could calm the situation.\nPhat!\nBaek Ye took the lead, and the warriors followed.\nThe Gate Keepers also ran towards the northeast where the Shivaras were flocking from.\nThe distance between the road and the place where the monsters were was 300 meters.\nIf the monsters rushed out, they would probably catch up to the fleeing citizens.\nChacha?!\nShivaras were coming out faster and more numerous than expected.\n“Kuaaaaah!\n“kakakkaka!”\nGrowling, the monsters ran towards the road.\n“Stop it! stop them at all costs!”\n“Not a single one of them should pass!”\nIn order to prevent the worst, around 700 warriors and Gate Keepers rushed towards the Shivaras, which were coming in huge numbers.\nIt was then.\n“Kuaaah! ”\nShhh!\nThe giant Alpha Shivara screamed and pulled out a giant tree with its six hands.\nThat’s how strong the monster was.\nThe giant pulled-out tree was thrown towards the warriors.\nShhhh!\n“Th-this is messed up!”\n“Avoid it!”\nThe warriors shouted loud and tried to avoid the giant flying tree.\nBut the speed at which the tree came was too fast.\nKwang!\n“Ackk!”\n“Ughh!”\nDue to the thrown tree, many warriors ended up getting hit and torn like pieces of meat.\nIn addition, the area where it hit exploded as there were numerous vehicles there, which made the people close-by get thrown away.\n“Ugh! It isn’t over yet!”\nThere were five trees in the hands of the Alpha Shivara.\nAnd another tree was thrown.\nShooo!\n“NOOO!”\nBaek Ye jumped into the air and cut it down with the sword qi.\nAhhh!\nConsidering the tree’s weight and the speed at which it flew, it took time for a Superior Master to hit it.\nBut that wasn’t the only tree.\nSwoosh!\n“No!”\nThe Alpha threw another tree again.\nLike a rocket, the tree flew towards the warriors and the Gate Keepers with great precision.\n“Tch!”\n“We are here!”\nPhat!\nJegal Bo-hyun and Hwang Bo-yun, also famous for their abilities, flew up and blocked the tree.\nAs they were at the beginning of Superior Master level, they managed to cut it down, but then the cut tree was thrown away.\n“Kuak!”\nAnd.\nThud!\n“Acukk!”\n“Kuak!”\nAnother group of Gate Keepers were hurt by another tree.\nThey tried to block it, but the attacks of the Alpha were different from what they imagined.\n“So this is an A-class Alpha Hazard entity.”\nIt was different from the other hazard entities they had faced so far.\n“Kuak!”\nThe problem was the attacks of the Alpha.\nShivaras were rushing in huge numbers, and the warriors and Gate Keepers were trying to stop them.\n“What is this?”\nThe monsters were evading the warriors and Gate Keepers as if their only purpose was to kill the citizens.\n“No! Get them away!”\n“Stop them!”\nIt was then.\n“Kuaaaahhhh!”\nThud! Thud! Thud!\n“A-Alpha!”\nThe Alpha, which threw another tree, ran towards the warriors and Gate Keepers.\nEach step it took shook the ground below.\nBaek Ye, who saw it, was shocked.\n‘Is he... trying to stop us while the others enter the city and harm the citizens?’\nHazard entities were known to have intelligence, but he didn’t expect it to be this smart.\nHe thought that the Alpha would act defensively as it had the core, so he was puzzled.\n“Stop! We need to keep them away!”\nHwang Bo-yun hurriedly shouted towards the Murim warriors.\nIt wasn’t a problem that could be solved by going after the Alpha.\n“Damn it!”\n“Catch them now!”\nPhat!\nAt his command, the warriors turned and tried to catch the Shivaras that had crossed them.\nIt was then.\nBang!\n“Kuak!”\n“Ackkk!”\nThe Alpha Shivara ran towards the warriors and slammed the six hands to the ground creating a huge shock wave and cracking the ground.\nThanks to that, dozens of warriors and Gate Keepers slipped and fell.\n“T-this monster!”\nHwang Bo-yun, who was running, jumped up and avoided the wave, but his anger soared as he raised his sword and flew to the Alpha Shivara.\nTo cut down its head.\n“Haaaaah!”\nIt was the 5th form of the Thunderbolt Sword, the Thunderbolt Sword to Defeat, of the Hwang Bo clan.\nLike a sword made of lightning, it aimed at the Alpha’s neck as it flew with blue light of energy.\nBut.\nBung! Pak!\n“Kuaak!”\nThe Alpha Shivara, which was over 30 meters tall, swung its palm, making the body of Hwang Bo-yun crash down.\nBang!\n“Kuak!”\nHwang Bo-yun coughed up blood as he suffered an internal injury.\nHe tried to block the palm, but nothing seemed to work against the Alpha.\n‘This is too much.’\nBaek Ye bit the inside of his cheek.\nThe 30-meter long giant monster was too much.\n‘What should we do?’\nIn order to subdue the Alpha, it seemed promising to let all the warriors and Gate Keepers rush in, but more than half of the Shivaras were dispersed.\n“T-they can’t be stopped!”\n“Damn it!”\nThe warriors tried to stop the rampaging Shivara, but they couldn’t, so they kept running towards the road.\nCitizens who managed to escape were definitely going to be slaughtered.\nIt was then.\nKick!\n“Uh?”\nFive buses ran down the road and stopped.\n“That...”\n“Yongchun group?”\nLooking at the logo on the bus, they could tell it was the Yongchun group.\nWhoops!\nWhen the bus stopped, the warriors of the Yongchun group appeared.\nAmong the warriors, there were strong ones like the chairman Chun Yu-jang.\nChun Yu-jang, who got down holding a sword, looked at the running Shivaras and shouted.\n“By the order of Lord Chun Ma! Eliminate all those entities without leaving a single one alive!”\n“Yes!”\nClang!\nAbout two hundred people pulled out their swords at once and rushed towards the Shivaras.\n“Is the Yongchun Group participating?”\n“Why them?”\nThey couldn’t help but wonder why unregistered warriors were participating.\nThat wasn’t it.\nBang! Bang! Bang!\n“Kuaaak!”\n“Ack!”\nThe Shivaras, who were running down, fell to the floor.\nAround a hundred fell down.\nAmong the warriors of Yongchun was a woman who held her hand out, she was the Gravity Witch Yu So-hwa.\n“Gravity Witch!”\nThe Gate Keepers who recognized her shouted.\nThey didn’t know why she was with the Yongchun group, but the appearance of the SS-class Keeper was enough of a shock to them.\n“I’ll put them down, hurry up!”\nBang! Bang! Bang!\nAs Yu So-hwa expanded the range of gravity, hundreds of Shivara fell to the floor in an instant.\nThe wider the range, the less effect her ability had, but still, she was extremely strong.\n“Yes! Kill them!”\n“Yes!”\nThanks to her, the warriors of Yongchun could deal with the Shivara.\n“Woahh!”\nThe warriors who were trying to stop the monsters cheered.\nThanks to the timely arrival, they managed to stop the slaughter of citizens.\n“The Yongchun is participating in the war...”\nBaek Ye, the branch manager, frowned.\nIt was surprising that they, unregistered warriors, showed up without even asking for their help.\nBut it was fortunate.\nBaek Ye shook his head and looked at the Alpha.\n‘The Alpha Shivara needs to be killed first.’\nWith Yongchun participating in the war, his hands were more free, so he had a chance to kill the Alpha and get the core.\nAn A-class core was extremely rare.\nBut the question was how to kill it.\n“Kuak!”\nThud! Thud!\nThe Alpha was trying to smash down the warriors as if they were bugs by using its legs and palms.\n‘What should I do?’\nThe Alpha could take down the techniques by slapping with his palm.\nThe most effective thing was to decapitate it, but the six arms wouldn’t let anyone get close to it.\nIt was then.\nSwush! Thud!\n“Ah!”\nSomeone flew and stood right in front of Baek Ye.\nIt was Chun Yeowun.\n“Y-You...”\n“To stay stiff like ice in front of such a thing. How unfortunate.”\n“What?”\nPhat!\nBefore Baek ye could even respond, Chun Yeowun went towards the Alpha.\nAt the sudden appearance of Chun Yeowun in front of it, the Alpha tried to swat it away like a fly.\n“I-it’s dangerous!”\nBaek Ye panicked and cried out, but then something amazing happened.\nWhen Chun Yeowun gently moved his hand.\nAh?!\nThud thud! Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!\n“KUAAKKKK!”\nThe six arms of the Alpha Shivara were severed. Seeing the giant arms fall to the ground, Baek Ye and the other warriors opened their mouths in shock.\n‘A-alpha... Shivara... arms...’\nThe man cut down the arms, which countered their sword qi, so easily.\n“T-that is!”\n“Invisible Sword!”\nHwang Bo-yun shouted in shock.\nSix hazy swords were floating around Chun Yeowun.\nInvisible Swords.\n“It is the Invisible Swords!”\n“No way!”\nOnly those who reached the level of Divine Master level could unfold the invisible swords.\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun reached out to one of the invisible swords and held it.\nGrab!\n“It has been long.”\nPhat!\nChun yeowun sprinted ahead and flew towards the Alpha.\nWith that, his form was divided into 24 afterimages and then merged into one.\n“Kuaak!”\nThud! Thud!\nSensing the danger, the Alpha tried to step back and move away, but Chun Yeowun’s form moved past his head like an illusion.\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun stopped right behind the head, and released the sword.\nAt that moment.\nThe Alpha Shivara’s head.\nThud!\nJust exploded.\nThe body of the Alpha, whose head was blown, staggered and fell to the ground.\nThud!\nChairman Chun Yu-jang, who was watching it from afar, mumbled with trembling eyes.\n“To... see this with my... own two eyes...”\nIt was the final form of the Sword Force of Sky Demon Sword, the unification.\nA legendary swordsmanship that no descendant could ever perform.",

      "content": "Bang!\nThe Alpha Shivara, whose head was blown away by Chun Yeowun’s sword, fell.\nThe body was so huge that it made the entire place shake.\n‘... is he really human?’\nGan-ong, who pretended to fight moderately in order to preserve as much power as possible, kept his eyes on the Alpha type.\nAn A-class Alpha Shivara, even a Superior Master could never deal with it alone.\nHowever, he just saw such a monster fall with his own eyes.\n‘Because it felt so different...’\nNow he understood how the 1st and 2nd teams were wiped out.\nGan-ong remembered what he was told earlier.\n[I leave it to your judgement. Decide whether to subdue the target and get it done. Or use the Murim Association and fight against the A-class Alpha.]\n‘No way.’\nThe damage the Murim warriors took was just 20%. The Alpha was defeated so quickly that no one could even approach it, let alone seize it.\nThe difference in skills was too great.\nShhhh!\nGan-ong put the goggles down to his chest.\nThey had the ability to record.\n‘Let’s make collecting information about him the top priority.’\nHe was told to analyze the target as much as possible.\nRather than ignorantly fighting him, he felt that collecting information would be the right thing to do.\n‘Ah! He is going to take the A-class core?’\nHe saw Chun Yeowun move to the back of the fallen Alpha.\nChun Yeowun, who sensed where the core was radiating, stood on the Alpha’s back and then held out his hand.\nThe Alpha Shivara’s body shook.\nHowever, nothing else happened.\nChun yeowun frowned.\n‘Indeed, the structure of the body is completely different from humans.’\nThe monster seemed to have some kind of resistance.\n‘Then.’\nChun Yeowun thrust the invisible sword into the back.\nPuck! Shhh!\nAfter drawing a circle, Chun Yeowun raised the energy.\nAnd.\nKukuku\n!\nA red core the size of a human body revealed itself from within the Shivara’s body.\nAlthough the outer shell of the core, which was still connected to the Gate, was attached, the energy coming from the core wasn’t normal.\nChun Yeowun held it and raised the energy.\nJjkkk!\nCracks began to appear.\nAs if breaking glass, the outer part cracked and.\nBang!\nA strong energy wave spread as it shattered.\nThe situation immediately changed.\n“Kwaaak!”\n“Kakaka! Kakakak!”\nThe other Shivaras who were trying to enter the city, howled and turned back trying to return.\n“Woah!”\n“They are heading back!”\nThe warriors and Gate Keepers shouted at once.\nIt was truly a strange phenomenon.\nEach time the core shattered and the wave =spread, the entities would desperately try to run back.\n“Stop them!”\n“Don’t step back! They shouldn’t get into the city!”\nDespite them retreating, the warriors and Gate Keepers didn’t take their eyes off them.\nBecause sometimes, the entities would run around in confusion.\nFortunately, the Shivaras were more intellectual than other entities, so they did their best to run back.\nGoo!\nThe energy emanating from the core was revealed, the A-class core.\n‘This is nice.’\nChun Yeowun was fascinated.\nThe energy was incomparable to the C-class core’s.\n‘If it is at this level, the energy alone is as pure as that of the spirit beasts’ cores.’\nOf course, it was difficult to compare.\nThe Spirit beasts had mysterious powers and excellent regeneration ability.\nHowever, for a simple and pure energy, this didn’t seem bad.\n“Ahhh!”\n“A-class core.”\nAdmiration flowed out from the mouths of all the warriors and Gate Keepers.\nThe A-class core that everyone wanted.\nGreed could be seen in their eyes.\n‘This is bad. An A-class core in the hands of someone I am seeing for the first time.’\nHwang Bo-yun couldn’t hide his regret.\nFor the first time in 10 years, an A-class appeared in Jinan city.\nAnd if consumed, one would achieve a dramatic increase in their internal energy.\n‘It’s said that one of the five Great Warriors took an A-class core and then rose to the status of Supreme Master level.’\nBecause of that rumor, every warrior became obsessed with the core.\nBut they weren’t stupid.\nWho would go against Chun Yeowun after witnessing his strength?\n‘Who the hell is he?’\nUnless they were hallucinating, they had just witnessed an invisible sword.\nThere were no warriors registered in the modern Murim at the level of Divine Master level.\n‘No. he looks so young though!’\n‘Like he is in his early twenties...’\nWhen they looked at Chun Yeowun, he seemed to be in his early twenties.\nAge wasn’t everything, but when trained for long, skills would grow.\nWhen everyone was in doubt, Jegal Bo-hyun stepped ahead.\nTak!\nHe was limping due to the injury in his leg as he approached Chun Yeowun.\n“I am Jegal Bo-hyun, the chairman of Jegal Cultural Foundation. Thanks to you, we were able to easily subdue the A-class hazard entity quickly. I wanted to thank you for it.”\nTak!\nFollowing their chairman, all the members of the Jegal company immediately bowed.\nIt was a polite show of gratitude, and then Zegal Bo-hyun went straight to the point.\n“But, there is something I would like to ask you.”\n“What do you want to ask?”\nChun Yeowun asked in a cold voice.\nJegal Bo-hyun frowned.\nHe thought the other person would bow and show some courtesy when he revealed his identity, but this was completely the opposite.\n“I have been in the Murim Association for over 20 years, but I have never heard of a great warrior like you. May I know who you are?”\nThere were two things he was curious about.\nSo he decided to ask the most natural question.\n‘Even Baek Ye who runs an affiliate of Blade Six didn’t seem to know.’\nIf there was such a talented person, people were bound to know.\nChun Yeowun answered.\n“You don’t need to know my name.”\n“W-what?”\nA truly arrogant answer.\nHe never imagined that he would be given such a disrespectful answer, he, an executive of the Murim association.\nIn a slightly angry voice, he said.\n“I acknowledge your power, but don’t you think you are too arrogant?”\nThe present clan leaders nodded their heads.\nJegal Bo-hyun deserved respect as he was a descendant of one of the five great clans of Forces of Justice.\nA middle-aged man standing behind Jegal Bo-hyun took the lead.\nTak!\n“I am Jegal Bang-hyun.”\nHe was the director of the company.\nHe came out as he realized that the chairman and the head of the clan was being insulted.\n“This man is the chairman of the Jegal Cultural Foundation. We don’t want to be hostile, but if you are a warrior, then please follow the rules.”\n“Yes...”\nChun Yeowun’s eyes narrowed.\nAlthough the Sky Demon order didn’t care, Murim was a place where people had pride in themselves.\nHowever, despite seeing the greatness of other people, they were seeking respect for their social position and status.\n‘This is the current Murim?’\nHow did Murim turn like this? Did it change with time? This was completely different from the Murim that Chun Yeowun knew.\n‘Hmm. This is good.’\nThought Baek Ye, who was watching it.\nEven if he didn’t say it, he was afraid of Chun Yeowun, an unidentified warrior, who suddenly turned into a hero.\nBut thanks to Chun Yeowun’s arrogant response, Murim warriors would never consider him a nice guy.\n‘If we can push the opinion of the people here against that man, then we can stop him from working in Jinan city.’\nBaek Ye took advantage and intervened.\n“Excuse me. I am the branch manager of the Murim Association of Jinan City, Baek Ye. There is one thing I need to ask. If you were so strong, then you could have solved the problem without risking the warriors’ and the people’s lives.”\nWhisper!\nThe warriors around began to whisper at those words.\nMost people didn’t think about that because they were too focused on the A-class core and Chun Yeowun.\nDue to Baek Ye, people realized that no casualties would have been there if Chun Yeowun had acted sooner.\n“Manager Baek is right.”\n“If you acted immediately, none of them would have died.”\n“Why were you late?”\nNegative opinions spread.\nRather than thinking that he came and reduced the loss of lives, they were now blaming him.\nBaek Ye was satisfied and tried to speak more.\n“And...”\nHwang Bo-yun intervened.\n“Wait a minute. Manager Baek. It was thanks to this man’s help that a lot of casualties were avoided, aren’t you being too negative now?”\nNot everyone shared the same opinion.\nAlthough Hwang Bo-yun didn’t forget about the A-class core, he was really thankful that Chun Yeowun had taken down that hazard entity.\n‘President Hwang doesn’t know when to speak and when no to. he doesn’t understand what would happen when an unregistered Murim warrior acts all mighty.’\nBaek Ye looked at Hwang Bo-yun and said.\n“Of course, I don’t think that this young man didn’t do any good. But those who have the power are supposed to be responsible. If the man dealt with the Alpha from the beginning, the damage could have been reduced. However, president Hwang and chairman Jegal suffered injuries as he waited.”\n“What are you trying to say?”\nChak!\nHe pointed to Chun Yeowun and said,\n“Isn’t it true that he waited for the warriors and Gate Keepers to move to obtain the core?”\nDissatisfaction rose in the eyes of warriors and Gate Keepers who were around.\n‘Yes!’\nBaek Ye’s face brightened.\nHe looked at Chun Yeowun.\nHaving pushed him into a corner, he reduced the chance of Chun Yeowun being used in Jinan city.\n“You seem to be misunderstanding something.”\n“Huh. It is too late to explain.”\nWhen Chun Yeowun was about to speak, Baek Ye tried to stop him.\n“If you don’t give a clear explanation, we won’t be able to believe...”\n“You have a long tongue.”\n“Wha?”\nGrab!\n“Uhmp!”\nChun Yeowun pulled out the tongue.\nBaek Ye was shocked as he didn’t think Chun Yeowun would do it.\nBut then he suddenly swung his finger.\nSlash!\n“Ack!”\nThe pulled-out tongue was cut.\nBaek Ye, whose tongue was cut, screamed in pain as it kept bleeding.\n“Manager Baek!!!”\n“What are you doing!”\nClang! Clang!\nStartled by Chun Yeowun’s act, the warriors pulled out their weapons.\nChun Yeowun said.\n“Did you think that I came here to save you?”\n“What do you mean?”\nJegal Bo-hyun asked with a nervous face.\nChun Yeowun responded in a cold voice.\n“You men also need to be cleaned up.”",

      "content": "‘!?’\nAt Chun Yeowun’s unexpected words, the Murim warriors couldn’t hide their shock.\nIf they weren’t mistaken, Chun yeowun just claimed that the people in the place had to be cleaned up.\nJega Bo-hyung shouted in a bewildered voice.\n“R-right now, do you even realize what you sai...”\n“Kuak! You vastard!”\nClash!\nBefore Jegal Bo-hyun could finish his words, Baek Yi swung his sword at Chun Yeowun.\nOne could see how angry he was. He looked like a devil with the blood dripping down his mouth.\nHe felt humiliated when his tongue got cut off in front of everyone.\n‘I will kill you!’\nWoosh!\nHe began to unfold blade qi.\nChun Yeowun, who looked at it, narrowed his eyes.\n‘Blade God Six skills.’\nIt was a technique of the Blade God Six Martial clan.\nJudging from the movement, it was Ascension of Dragon, one of the starting forms of Extreme Art of Blade God.\nUnfolding such a technique meant that Baek Ye was a disciple of the Blade God Six Martial clan.\nWheik!\nThe sharp blade qi, which came out like a tornado, tried to wrap itself around Chun yeowun.\n‘Got you!’\nOnce a person gets caught in it, they would turn into pieces as the tornado would close in.\nIt was a technique that couldn’t be stopped if one didn’t dodge from the beginning.\n“What amazing skill!”\nThe warriors around couldn’t hide their admiration.\nIt was no exaggeration to say that it was the best execution of the Blade God Six Martial clans technique.\nBut.\n“You think this is enough to trap me?”\nUnfortunately, if someone wanted to corner Chun Yeowun, then it had to be the Blade God, the creator of the blade techniques himself.\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun held his sword and then stabbed the centre of the technique, which was in the process of unfolding.\nClang!\n‘Ah!’\nAn amazing thing happened.\nAs the technique was halted, Baek Ye’s body bounced back.\nPapapak!\n“Kuak!”\nAs he was hit while unfolding the technique, there was no way Baek Ye was going to be fine.\nHis face was pale as he coughed up blood.\n‘Kuka, the technique of Extreme Art of Blade God...’\nBaek Ye, who had absolute confidence in his technique, was trembling all over since his best technique was broken down right away.\n“No way!”\n“No one in Jinan could do it so easily...”\nThe warriors couldn’t hide their shock.\nThey did know that Chun Yeowun was a Divine Master, but they never dreamed that a Superior Master level warrior couldn’t even stand against him.\n‘A monster.’\nThis alone made them realize that no one could go against Chun Yeowun.\nHowever, he didn’t stop there.\n“There is no reason to keep you, descendant of Blade God Six Martial Clan, alive.”\n“uh... uh... wai...”\nChun Yeowun pressed his sword against Baek Ye’s forehead.\nPuck!\n“Kuak!”\nAs a sharp blade pierced his head, Baek Ye died right away.\nAs his body fell, his face showed despair.\n“President!”\n“You!!!”\nThe warriors of Six Essence yelled as they grabbed their swords.\nHowever, even the fifty of them didn’t have the courage to attack Chun Yeowun.\nTheir bodies were trembling with fear.\nChun Yeowun spoke.\n“Why aren’t you coming? Your leader was killed by my hands.”\n“Tch!”\nDespite the provocation, they were unable to respond.\nA single step, and they all felt like they would be killed.\n“What the hell is this!”\nJegal Bo-hyun shouted as he saw the dead figure of Baek Ye.\nHe really knew nothing.\nThis was a place where the Jinan warriors and Gate Keepers were gathered to subdue the enemy of mankind.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun killed Baek Ye in front of all the audience.\n‘Isn’t he even thinking about what he is doing?’\nConflict between warriors should never occur in a place where citizens were present.\nWho in the whole world would act like this?\nThat was when someone stepped ahead.\n“I didn’t want to interfere because I thought that this was an internal matter of the association, but I don’t think I can stand by anymore.”\nHe was the platoon leader, Ma Kang-cheom, the leader of Jinan.\nGate Keepers belonging to the National Defense took over the role of National Guards during defense battles, and he was the man in charge of the situation.\nJudging that Chun Yeowun was causing a riot, he decided to interfere.\n‘Ah!’\nAnd naturally, the warriors didn’t like Gate Keepers interfering with their matters.\nHowever, Jegal Bo-hyun thought that it was helpful since he was trying to stop the mess.\n‘That monster, why is he acting like this towards us? I don’t know the reason for his attitude, but he won’t be able to lay his hands on the Gate Keepers.’\nIf that was to happen, then the whole government would turn against him.\nMa Kang-cheom, who approached Chun Yeowun, said.\n“Stop this now. In the time of war, in front of everyone, you murdered a significant member of the Murim Association. As a member of national defense, we cannot let this pass. You are under arrest in accordance with Article 8, paragraph 3 of...”\n“Don’t interfere in Murim affairs.”\nChun Yeowun cut his words in a cold voice.\nHowever, Ma Kang-cheon showed no signs of backing down.\n“I can’t do that. From the moment you committed the murder in the war situation, it was no longer a Murim’s...”\n“That so? Then there is nothing I can do.”\n“What?”\nSwish!\nThud!\n“Kuak!”\nMa Kang-cheom’s neck was bent sideways.\nHe staggered a little ahead and collapsed with a dumbfounded look.\n“P-platoon leader!”\nThe Gate Keepers shouted in advance.\nThey didn’t expect that anyone would do such a thing.\nSome were bewildered, while others tried to fearlessly use their abilities against Chun Yeowun.\nChun Yeowun lowered his hand.\nAnd.\nThud!\n“Kuak!”\n“W-what is this!”\nAll of them kneeled. Some who had abilities to raise their strength tried to move, but they couldn’t even budge.\nEnraged at it, the 3rd platoon leader, Yeo Gyuk-mun, shouted.\n“Stop this right now! Are you going to turn the Gate Keepers and the Defense into your enemies?”\n“You are such funny people. You shouldn’t have intervened in the first place.”\nChun Yeowun lowered his hand even further.\nThe kneeling Gate Keepers fell to the floor.\nThud!\n“Ugh!”\nTheir bodies lying on the floor were glued to the ground.\nThe sounds of their bones crushing under the pressure could be heard.\nCrack!\n“Sa-save me!”\n“L-leader!”\nAt the sight of his members dying under the pressure, the leader couldn’t turn a blind eye.\nHe shouted loudly as he put his hands on his earphone.\n“If you don’t stop this right now, I will be reporting this to the Defense. If that happens, you will become the worst criminal in not just Jinan, but also the chin...”\nCrack!\nBefore he could finish speaking, the earphones were broken.\nAs Chun Yeowun looked around, not just the leader’s but all the Gate Keepers’ earphones got broken.\nBreak!\n“Euk!”\n“E-earphone!”\nThey immediately threw off the earphones.\nAs a result, their contact with the Defense was cut off.\nShocked, Yeo Gyuk-mun looked at Chun Yeowun in fear.\n“H-how can a warrior possess such abili...”\nChun Yeowun stretched out his hand towards the man.\nHis body trembled and got dragged by Chun Yeowun.\nGrab!\nChun Yeowun grabbed his neck.\n“Kuak!”\n“What was that about the National Defense Bureau?”\n‘Hik!’\nThe man was in utter fear.\nHe felt like he had touched something he shouldn’t have.\nHowever, if he stayed still like this, he was sure he was going to die.\n“So-stop it! This is just a matter of time. The Defense will figure this out and make you pay for...”\n“Is that so?”\n“What do you mean?”\n“If all of you were annihilated while dealing with the entities, why would they target me?”\n‘!?’\nAt those words, Yeo Gyuk-mun couldn’t hide his shock.\n“What nonsense are you saying about us being killed while dealing with the entities! Even citizens have seen it... huh?”\nIn an instant, something flashed through his mind.\nHe remembered the dead Baek Ye’s words, who mentioned how Chun Yeowun intervened too late into the battle.\n‘Maybe... this is the reason he touched... Alpha Shivara...’\nHis face went stiff.\nOnly then did he realize why Chun Yeowun waited for citizens to get away from the place.\n‘To think about all that in the middle of the war!’\nNo one was around.\nNo single citizen was around, no person would know what happened to the warriors and the Gate Keepers.\nChun Yeowun would deal with all the warriors, and then get rid of the Gate Keepers who ignored his warning.\nDidn’t that mean that he planned to kill them all from the beginning?\n“You, You don’t plan on doing...”\n“Did you think I was joking?”\nGrab!\n“Kuak!”\nChun Yeowun tried to break the neck of the leader with his hand.\nIt was then.\n“Stop!”\nJegal Bo-hyun screamed, making Chun Yeowun turn.\nHe was holding a sword glowing blue.\n“Are you ready to start showing your true self?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, Jegal Bo-hyun exclaimed with a firm expression.\n“Listen, all warriors and Gate Keepers! That heinous man is trying to harm all of us!”\nHis voice was carried out by energy to make everyone hear.\nChun Yeowun’s eyes turned cold at that.\n‘Did you think that we’d run away when you said that you would take us down?’\nJegal Bo-hyun believed that there was only one way to overcome the situation.\nThat would be working together.\n“Even if he is a Divine Master level, he is still a human! Do you think that he won’t tire down? We have strength on our side and we can get through this challenge! Everyone, please help!!”\nWoong!\nThe warriors who were terrified by Chun Yeowun’s power, whispered at Jegal Bo-hyun’s words.\nIncluding the injured ones, there were 500 warriors. And adding the Gate Keepers, it would be 600.\n“We have the upper hand.”\n“It might be possible.”\n“As long as he isn’t an entity, he can be dealt with, stab his vital point and he dies!”\nAll that was needed to take down a human was to hit his vital points.\nAnd that would mark their victory.\nThe moral of the Gate Keepers and warriors slowly revived.\n“Tch”\nChun Yeowun shook his head.\nAiming his sword, Jegal Bo-hyun spoke with a happy face.\n“Don’t act pretentious. Even if it is you, you think you can deal with us? You used up a lot of strength to get rid of the Shivaras and the Alpha. Even if you are a Divine Master level, there is a limit to...”\nIt was then.\nChun Yeowun stretched out his hand towards the air.\nCold air began to spread around and countless Ice Swords formed in the air.\nJjjjkkkk!\n‘!!!’\nThe sky was filled with Ice Swords.\nAt the marvelous sight, Jegal Bo-hyun was at a loss for words.\nIt was the same for other warriors.\n“It can’t be.”\n“I-Is he even human?”\nAs Jegal Bo-hyun said, everyone believed that Chun Yeowun had exhausted his strength.\nThey thought that he wouldn’t be able to make a large number of Ice Swords anymore, but the man could still unfold so many at once!\nCrack!\n“Kuak!”\nChun Yeowun broke the neck of Yeo Gyuk-mun and then threw the body away like it was trash and said.\n“What do you mean by exhaust my strength?”\nShhh!\nJegal Bo-hyun’s sword stopped shining.\nHe took a step back with a white face and a broken will.\nThis wasn’t something that any man could do.\n‘Monster!’\nHe couldn’t think of any other word.\nEven the five strongest warriors would be nothing in front of Chun Yeowun.\nLooking at all of them, Chun Yeowun spoke.\n“I think you are all still mistaken.”\n“W-what are you saying?”\nShh!\nChun yeowun didn’t speak and just pointed his hand to the side.\nHundreds of floating Ice Swords flew towards the warriors at great speed.\nPapapak!\n“Kuak!”\n“Kuk!”\nScreams erupted from all over the place.\n“A-avoid it!”\n“How can we... kuk!”\nThey were simple Ice Swords, but Ice Swords with sword qi condensed on them. It was as if Chun Yeowun was wielding each sword.\nIn an instant, fifty people died.\n‘They?’\nThey were all the people of Six Essence.\nWithin seconds, a strong force of Jinan city was wiped out with a single gesture.\n“No way...”\n“Are... are you really going to kill everyone?”\nChun Yeowun looked at the ones who were still alive and answered.\n“You still think you won’t have to die?”\nCreepy!\nThe way he said it made a chill run down all their spines.\nThe man in front of them wasn’t lying.\nHe really intended to kill everyone.\nLike everyone else, Hwang Bo-yun, who was trembling in fear, wanted to know the reason.\n“What the hell did we commit to deserve this?”\nHe couldn’t understand it.\nThe other people nodded at Hwang Bo-yun’s question.\nChun Yeowun spoke to them in a strong voice.\n“The sin of daring to touch my cult!”\n“Cult?”\nThey were puzzled and unable to understand what he meant.\nPhat!\nNine warriors leisurely passed through the warriors and the Gate Keepers, approached Chun Yeowun, and knelt.\n‘Why are they kneeling in front of him?’\nThey were all members of the Yongchun Group alongside their chairman.\nThere was no way that Jegal Bo-hyun or Hwang Bo-yun, the descendants of the five great clans, who monitored everything with spies, didn’t know who they were.\n‘No way...’\nJegal Bo-hyun’s eyes trembled.\nAt that time, chairman Chun Yu-jang, who knelt and bowed, greeted Chun Yeowun.\n“Lord Chun Ma! Please give us a chance to take revenge for the Cult!”",

      "content": "Jegal Bo-hyun couldn’t understand it.\n‘Chun Ma?’\nIs there anyone in Murim who didn’t know what Chun Ma meant?\nIt was a worshipped title within the Sky Demon Order, given to the one who was the strongest in the history of Murim.\nAlong with the scholars of other factions, such as the Shaolin temple’s monk, and the birth place of martial arts Jianghu region, the figure called Chun ma was a legend.\nEveryone knew about that.\nHowever, then appeared Chun Yeowun, the 2nd Chun Ma, who swept the entire Murim over a thousand years ago. It was known that he was the ultimate Chun Ma.\n‘I thought there was no other Chun Ma in the demonic Cult.’\nSince the 2nd Chun ma, there was no warrior who stood out like the past ones.\nAnd especially now.\nEveryone in the Murim Association knew that the Sky Demon order had fallen since the company was dissolved.\nBut now, Chun Yu-jang, who was supposed to be aiming for the title of Lord, was acting like a follower?\n“Please give me and the members a chance to take revenge for the cult!”\n“Give us the chance!”\nFollowing Chun Yu-jang, 8 senior executives of Yongchun shouted.\nSince the dissolution of Black Sky Company, they were all waiting for such a chance.\nTheir blood boils at the thought of what they had been through.\n‘Demonic Cult!’\nThe warriors including Jegal Bo-hyun were sure of one thing.\nThe monster that the Yongchun Group members were kneeling before, was a member of Demonic Cult.\nHwang Bo-yun bit his lip and said.\n“I think that’s the reason you are trying to kill us all. Black Sky Company, no, it is for revenge for the destruction of the Demonic...”\nShh! Puck!\n“Ack!”\nAt that moment, two floating Ice Swords flew and pierced both his thighs.\nHwang Bo-yun, whose legs weakened, fell to his knees.\nThud!\n“Kuak!”\nChun Yeowun spoke to him.\n“Demonic Cult? I left you alone because you looked like a nice one, but you seem reckless as well.”\nThe other warriors would never even dare say anything. However, hwang Bo-yun didn’t back down.\n“Who are you? I never heard of warriors like you in the Demonic Cult?”\nThe Lord was imprisoned.\nAnd the three who were fighting for the title of Lord weren’t that strong.\nClang! Shh!\nSuddenly, director Huan Myung-oh pointed his sword at Hwang Bo-yun’s throat and said.\n“You aren’t in a position to ask that.”\n“... Huan Myung-oh!”\nHwang Bo-yun raised his voice and looked at him.\nSince they have been sensding spies, he knew that Huan Myung-oh was one of the leaders in the Yongchun group.\nWhoop!\n“Reckless.”\nHuan Bo-yun couldn’t hide his anger.\nIf it weren’t for Chun Yeowun, he could have taken down Huan Myung-oh right away.\n“You never thought that this day would come, did you?”\nOn the other hand, the smile didn’t leave Huan Myung-oh’s lips.\nFor nearly 27 years, he spent every day living in shame.\nConstantly under the eyes of spies, the Yongchun group struggled to keep a low profile.\nHowever, Hwang Bo-yun, a member of the Forces of Justice, one of the three major factions, was now kneeling.\nHe couldn’t hide the pleasure.\n“Give me a chance.”\n“A chance?”\n“yes!”\nShhh!\nChun Yu-jang put his hand on the sword and answered.\nHe wanted to slaughter all the warriors right away if Chun Yeowun gave the orders.\nThat was when someone shouted.\n“This is too much!”\nIt was Chae-sun, the president of Mokyang furniture, one of the executives of the Murim Association.\nHe continued to speak with an upset face.\n“Our Mokyang Sword Clan has no relationship with the Cult. Isn’t it too much to kill everyone in here?”\nThat was true.\nThe Mokyang Sword clan had joined the Murim association just 15 years ago.\nAnd it was a clan which had nothing to do with the incident that happened 27 years ago.\n“They have nothing to do?”\nWhen Chun Yeowun looked at Chun Yu-jang with a questioning look, he nodded his head.\nAnd then someone else shouted.\n“Our clan also joined the Murim Association just 10 years ago. Like the Mokyang Sword clan, we had nothing to do with the Demonic Cult.”\nAnd when that happened, people kept screaming from here and there telling they had nothing to do with what happened.\n“It is the same with us!”\n“Our clan had nothing to do with your Cult. Trust us!”\nThey were all struggling to get noticed, it made no sense for them that they were involved in an incident which happened 27 years ago.\nIt was disappointing to see that they wanted to get out alive and leave their comrades to die.\n“Director Ma! Are you only aiming to save yourself?”\n“If not! Should our clan be destroyed because of something that we didn’t even do!”\n“What! Director Ma is right. If there is someone to be held responsible, then it should be the ones who did it!”\n“Huh, these people! Bowing down to someone just to save your neck!”\n“What!”\nPeople began to argue.\n‘Haa...’\nAt that sight, Jegal Bo-hyun’s thoughts turned complicated.\nHe thought that the members of the Murim Association would have a sense of unity, but this was just so messed up.\n‘Is this human nature?’\nIt was a total separation.\nJegal Bo-hyun who was perplexed, looked at someone.\n‘Leader Ju?’\nIt was Ju Mun-pyeong.\nHe joined the Murim Association 16 years ago as an executive in the Jinan City branch.\nAlong with the other ones, he was someone who had nothing to do with the events which happened 27 years ago. He kept being silent contemplating in fear, till now that is.\n‘Well, not everyone turned their backs on us. The Forces of Justice aren’t dead yet... ah!’\nSuddenly a good thought came to Jegal Bo-hyun’s mind. He sent a message to Ju Mun-pyeong.\n[Leader Ju.]\n[Chairman Jegal.]\n[Since we don’t have time, I’ll say it.]\n[What are you.... ?]\n[You have nothing to do with what happened 27 years ago. Please state that.]\n[No way. How can I do such a thing just to live among the wicked demonic Cult people who are aiming to destroy justice?]\n[I know how righteous you are. But if you survive, you will be able to inform the main body of the Murim Association about this.]\nJu Mun-pyeong looked at him with confused eyes.\nWhat Jegal Bo-hyun said was to let the entire Murim Association know about what happened.\n[If the truth wil be told, then even those who turned their backs on us will end up becoming witnesses.]\n[Chairman Jegal...]\n[Please. Survive for the cause.]\nJu Mun-pyeong understood it.\nSurely, the man was right.\nIf he survived and revealed the facts, everyone would come together and stop the demonic Cult.\nDetermined, Ju Mun-pyeong raised his hand and shouted.\n“Our Wise Medicine clan also joined the Murim Association just 16 years back and we hadn’t done anything to your Cult!”\nAt that, Jegal Bo-hyun nodded his head.\nIn the end, 29 clans expressed that they had nothing to do with the demonic cult.\nAnd a total of 187 individual warriors.\n“Lord Chun Ma. Are we sparing them?”\nDirector Hang Yu-rin asked.\nShe thought that keeping them alive just because they hadn’t done anything, would still turn into trouble.\n“They will stab us in the back.”\nAnother person agreed. Even if the people had nothing to do with the past events, they would sooner or later turn their backs on the Cult the way they turned their backs on the Murim Association.\n“We need to kill them all.”\nAt that, Chae-sun, of another clan shouted.\n“I will never betray your Cult or back stab you, I swear.”\n“We swear too!”\n“Please have mercy on us!”\nAt one person’s words, everyone began to plead. They all didn’t want to die.\nChun Yeowun looked at Chun Yu-jang asked.\n“What would you do if you were the Lord?”\n‘!?’\nWhen he was asked to speak his opinion out of the blue, Chun Yu-jang was shocked.\nHe didn’t just ask for his opinion, but asked him what he would do if he was the Lord.\n‘Ah... ancestor is testing me.’\nHe thought his ancestor was testing him.\nChun Yu-jang, who knew that he had to deal with this to get under good graces, was troubled.\nAs a Lord, he wanted to be wise.\nChun Yu-jang answered with a bright face when he thought of an answer.\n“Lord Chun Ma. I found the answer. Can you entrust this to me?”\n“Go ahead.\"\nChun Yeowun allowed it.\nChun Yu-jang stepped ahead and looked at the warriors who were begging for their lives.\n“You have all said that you would never stand against the cult.”\n“Yes!”\nChae-sun, a warrior, answered.\n“Then swear it.”\n“We said that we would. We would never divulge this to any...”\n“Not that. Swear allegiance to the Cul!”\n‘!?’\nAt Chun Yu-jang’s words, they couldn’t hide their shock.\nThey did just betray their allies in order to survive.\nHowever, Chun Yu-jang was now asking them to swear their loyalty to the Sky Demon Order.\nMumble!\nConfusion arose.\nAnd Chun Yu-jang continued.\n“I will spare anyone who comes under the Cult. But if you don’t, we won’t be able to trust you no matter what you say.”\nAt those harsh words, the clan leaders fell into despair.\nIt was the only way to stay alive. But they would continue to live in shame.\nChae-sun, of Mokyang Sword Clan, knelt down and cried.\n“Our Mokyang Sword clan swears allegiance to the Sky Demon Order. As evidence, our company will be operating as an affiliate to the Yongchun group.”\n“H-he! A traitor!”\nAs he swore, people began to criticize him.\nSeeing him do that made them despise the clan.\n‘Kuk!’\nFeeling ashamed, Chae-sun closed his eyes.\nHowever, he endured it because of his desire to preserve his clan.\n“Even so you people...”\nPuck!\n“Kuak!”\nAt that moment, Chun Yu-jang’s sword pierced the chest of a warrior who was about to criticize the man.\nChun Yu-jang looked at the warriors and warned them.\n“Whoever criticizes our Cult members, will be dead.”\nThe warning was extremely effective.\nEveryone turned silent.\nNobody criticized Chae-sun anymore.\nAs everyone turned silent, more clan leaders began to swear allegiance.\nAt that, Chun Yu-jang gave orders to General Manager Suh-jeong.\n“Capture all of this on video.”\n“Yes.”\nSuh-jeong pulled out his phone and began to record.\n‘This...’\nJu Mun-pyeong, who was about to take the oath, was irritated.\nIf everything was going to be recorded, then it was no longer possible to dream of turning back.\nHe looked at Jegal Bo-hyun.\n‘Ahhh...’\nJegal Bo-hyun sent a message with an apologetic look.\n[Please... for the sake of Murim.]\nHe was encouraging people to make a false oath.\nJu Mun-pyeong nodded with a bitter expression.\nHe would end up being branded as a traitor on both sides, but if Jegal Bo-hyun could at least vouch for him, then it might work out.\nJu Mun-pyeong stood in front of the place where everyone was taking an oath and said.\n“Our Wise Medicine Clan pledges to come under the Sky Demon order. As proof...”\nWith that, many people came ahead and pledged their allegiance to the Sky Demon Order. As proof, they promised to be affiliated with the Yongchun group.\nSince everything was filmed, the executives of the Yongchun group felt satisfied.\n‘He is wise.’\n‘The lord will praise him.’\nThis was more beneficial to the Cult than killing them. They even had a video as proof.\nPak!\nOnce it was done, Chun Yu-jang knelt down and reported.\n“Reporting to Lord Chun Ma! 29 clan leaders have pledged allegiance to the cult!”\nHis eyes were filled with confidence believing that he proved himself a little.\nHe thought Chun Yeowun would treat him differently than before.\nHowever, what Chun Yeowun said was beyond his expectations.\n“This is it?”\n“Huh?”\n“I asked if this is it.”\nChun Yu-jang was puzzled.\nHe made people take an oath of allegiance, what else could he do?\n“I. Lord Chun ma what you are...”\n“Still a long way off.”\n“Yes?”\nChun Yeowun reached out his hand, making someone come fly towards him.\nGrab!\n“Ack!\nIt was Ju Mun-pyeong. He was suddenly pulled and caught by Chun Yeowun.\nPuzzled, he asked.\n“W-why?”\nChun Yeowun looked at Jegal Bo-hyun and said,\n“How funny! You thought you would make a false oath and I wouldn’t know?”\n‘Haaa?’\nJegal Bo-hyun was so shocked that he was at a loss for words.\nIt was the same with Ju Mun-pyeong, caught in Chun Yeowun’s hand.\n‘H-how in hell did?’\nThey used telepathy.\nHow could he know what they were talking about?\nFlustered, Ju Mun-pyeong tried to play it cool.\n“W-what do you mean by that? How could I give a false oath...”\nCrack!\n“Kuak!”\nBefore the man could ever explain, Chun Yeowun broke his neck.\n‘H-how?’\n‘He sword allegiance.’\nPeople couldn’t understand what they’d just witnessed.\nOnly Jegal Bo-hyun had a different reaction.\n‘How did he know?’\nHe had never heard about a person with the ability of eavesdropping on telepathy.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun didn’t seem to do anything. It seemed like he just heard what they conversed.\nChun Yeowun addressed himself to those who swore allegiance to him.\n“Let’s test your loyalty.”\n“Test?”\nChun Yeowun pointed at Jegal Bo-hyun and the other warriors who didn’t swear allegiance.\n“Kill them.”\n‘!!!’\nThe faces of those who swore allegiance went stiff. They thought they would be spared.\nBut to be asked to kill the people they were working with until a moment ago.\n“Suh-jeong.”\n“Yes!”\n“Shoot the video of them proving their allegiance too.”\n“Yes!”\nAt Chun yeowun’s command, he pulled out the phone again.\nThe Murim warriors who swore allegiance were dumbfounded.\n‘Huh, how can we...’\n“Kuak!”\nIf such a scene was recorded, they would end up being the main culprits.\nAnd if they don’t do what he asked, their loyalty will be questioned.\nThey were in a dire situation.\nChun Yeowun urged them in a cold voice.\n“On the count to three. Kill all those who don’t move.”",

      "content": "“One.”\nChun Yeowun started counting.\nThe warriors who swore allegiance were equally humiliated.\nHowever, for those who had to be killed, this was the worst moment of their lives.\nComplex emotions were mixed in their eyes as they looked at their former allies holding weapons in their hands.\n“You... you wicked devil!”\nPhat!\nUnable to hold back his anger, Jegal Bo-hyun forgot about the huge difference in power and tried to attack Chun Yeowun.\nHowever, there was no way that the executives of Yongchun would leave him alone!\n“How dare you!”\nTatatak!\nIn an instant, director Hang Yu-rin, who suddenly appeared behind him, sealed his blood points and knocked him to the floor.\n“Kuk!”\nEven though they were on the same level, Jegal Bo-hyun had already suffered internal injuries. Thus he was easily beaten.\nHang Yu-rin, who was pressing the man down, grabbed his hand and said.\nGrab!\n“Kuak!”\n“Look closely. Huhuhu.”\nHang Yu-rin’s face was full of joy.\nThe thought of revenge, to make them taste the pain they felt when they helplessly watched their Lord, Chun Woo-jin, get imprisoned, made her heart pound.\n‘Is this what revenge feels like!’\nShe wasn’t the only one feeling that way.\nChun Yu-jang was also enjoying the moment. Recalling the suffering they all had suffered for 27 years, there was no sympathy in his heart.\nChun Yeowun counted the next number.\n“Two.”\n‘Ahhh...’\n‘What should I do!’\nPeople were all confused and scared.\nThey pledged their allegiance to the Sky Demon Order in order to save their lives, but killing their colleagues was a different matter.\n“These traitors.”\n“The Murim Association will punish you.”\nAs they hesitated, the other warriors criticized them.\nIf it wasn’t for Chun Yeowun’s Air Swords floating in the air, they would have definitely punished the traitors right away, but they couldn’t.\nAnd then the last number came out.\n“Three!”\nPhat!\nAs soon as it fell, the warriors who swore allegiance swung their weapons towards the other warriors, their faces full of pain.\n“Shit! Forgive me!”\n“Ahhhh!”\nPuck! Puck!\n“Kuak! Y-you people! In the end...”\nScreams and blood erupted from everywhere.\n“You bastard, you traitors....”\n“Even so, you guys are... Kuak!”\nIt was a weird situation.\nAs they died, they ended up insulting the traitors and not Chun Yeowun.\nClang!\n“What?”\nAt that time, those who were about to be killed pulled out their weapons.\n“What are you doing?”\n“What? Before I go, I will kill you bastards!”\n“AH! Me too!”\nPhat!\nThe warriors who drew their weapons rushed towards them.\nAt first, they stood still because they were scared of Chun Yeowun. But if they were to die anyway, then they would at least bring the traitors with them.\n“Ancestor!”\nChun Yu-jang tried to stop the rebellious warriors, but.\n“Leave it alone.”\n“Sorry?”\nChun Yeowun stopped him.\n‘Why?’\nChun Yu-jang and the other executives were puzzled.\nHowever, they soon found out the reason.\nThings have drastically changed.\nThe warriors, who were suffering while attacking their comrades, changed.\n“Kuak! Traitor? Who is a traitor!”\n“You! We have to face the consequences of what you people did!”\n“Isn’t this all because of you?”\nThose who swore allegiance and attacked their colleagues. At some point, they really wanted to kill them.\nHwang Bo-yun and Jegal Bo-hyun, who were watching the situation, were filled with misery.\nIt was very painful to watch.\nRage!\nAs they weren’t getting involved in the horrific battle, they had no choice but to get angry at Chun Yeowun, the cause of all this.\nBoth shouted at Chun Yeowun at the same time.\n“How could you do such a thing!”\n“How can you even call yourself a human being!”\nChun Yeowun spoke in an indifferent voice.\n“Why would I care?”\n‘T-this man is really...’\nJegal Bo-hyun was left speechless.\nIt felt like Chun Yeowun was the devil himself.\nUnlike him, Hwang Bo-yun was more aggressive.\n“What? Ha! Didn’t you take advantage of being strong and drive them into harming each other? What you are doing is insulting the honour of warriors. This isn’t just killing. How can you do that?”\n“What a joke.”\n“What?”\nStep! Step!\nChun Yeowun approached him.\nHe lowered himself down to the man, who was pushed down by Huan Myung-oh, and spoke as he looked into his eyes.\n“Did they not have a choice?”\n‘!?’\nHwang Bo-yun yelled.\n“What choice! You were threatening to kill them!”\n“If you don’t want to be insulted as a warrior, isn’t there a good way to end this?”\n“T-that...”\nHwang Bo-yun was speechless.\nHe thought of saying something, but he couldn’t figure out what to refute.\nThose who swore allegiance to the Sky Demon Order had done it because they wanted to live, and it was the warriors of the Murim Association who chose not to stay silent and attack the traitors.\n“They chose it.”\n“Kuk!”\nHwang Bo-yun, who realized it, was upset.\nHe tried to rebuke him.\n“Even so, this isn’t right. Are you not ashamed? Even if it is for revenge, for a strong person like you...”\nGrab!\n“Ump!”\nChun Yeowun grabbed his mouth.\n“I thought you were a decent guy, but you talk too much.”\n“Ump! Ump!”\n“Weren’t you also good at scheming? Didn’t you imprison the Lord of the Cult and then manage to break it up by creating internal problems?”\n“Eup! Eup!”\n‘T-that...’\nHwang Bo-yun’s eyes trembled.\nHe knew that Chun Yeowun was talking about the incident which happened 27 years ago.\nAt that time, the other three factions focused on overthrowing the Sky Demon Order, one of the four major factions in Murim.\nIt was a shameful decision, but they had to do it in order to drive out the Forces of Evil and the Demonic Cult. As a result, the factions of the Forces of Justice ruled Murim.\n“Your factions always talk about harmony and righteousness.”\nChun Yeowun gripped stronger.\nCrack!\nThe teeth and jaws cracked.\nBlood and saliva began to flow out of the closed mouth.\n“Kuaaak!”\nIt was so painful that Hwang Bo-yun tried to push away Chun Yeowun’s hand.\nBut Huan Myung-oh, who was behind him, pulled the right hand back and broke it.\nCrack! Puck!\n“Kuak!”\n“Don’t move.”\nHwang Bo-yun was in pain as he couldn’t move.\nSeeing him writhe, Chun Yeowun said.\n“Bullshit.... No matter how fancy you pack those words, you people are also scum who gain from other people’s pain to reach your goals. That is the answer.”\nHe looked at the place where the warriors were killing each other. More than half of them were dead, the ground was overflowing with corpses, and the smell of blood wafted everywhere.\nThey were struggling to live.\nCompassion and righteousness were nowhere to be seen.\n‘This... this... uh...’\nHwang Bo-yun couldn’t come up with anything.\nTo refute it, the reality in front of him had to be an illusion, but he knew it wasn’t.\nWith eyes full of anguish, Hwang Bo-yun mumbled.\n“Wh... where ...th... jus...tic...”\n‘Where the hell... is justice...’\nAs his mouth was grabbed, he couldn’t pronounce it properly, but one could understand what he meant.\n“You are stupid. Would a warrior talk like that?”\nGrab!\n“Kuak!”\nCrack!\nChun Yeowun tore off the jaw joints.\nHe then spoke to the man who was bleeding profusely.\n“Strength is justice.”\nAt those words, Hwang Bo-yun lowered his head as his eyes went blank.\nChun Yeowun stood up and approached the trembling Jegal Bo-hyun.\nHe instinctively knew it was his turn.\nIf only Hang Yu-rin hadn’t sealed his blood points, he would have run away.\n“Chun Yu-jang.”\n“Yes!”\nChun Yu-jang approached Chun Yeowun at the call.\n“You said you wanted to take revenge? Go on.”\n“Thank you!”\nWhen he was given the chance, Chun Yu-jang’s face brightened.\nChun Yu-jang drew his sword and approached Jegal Bo-hyun.\nSrrng!\nLooking at the sharp sword, Jegal Bo-hyun trembled.\n“Chun Yu-jang!”\nDeath was definite.\nAnd before he died, he wanted to at least say something.\n“Put away the delusions that you will be able to resurrect the Demonic Cult with this. Do you think you will be able to face the whole Murim when you’re weaker than how you were 27 years ago?”\n“Is that all?”\nChun Yu-jang raised his sword.\nHe intended to cut the head off at once.\nJegal Bo-hyun looked at Chun Yeowun.\n“You are doing this believing in just that one monster. Chun Yu-jang. don’t think that he is the only monster in the world.”\nAt those words, Chun Yu-jang narrowed his eyes.\nIf what Jegal Bo-hyun said was true, then it meant that there was someone on the same level as Chun Yeowun.\nWondering, Chun Yu-jang asked.\n“Are you talking about the President of the Association?”\nChun Yu-jang had heard the rumours.\nRumours that the president of the Murim Association was at Divine Master level.\nPeople thought that it was a nonsensical story.\nWith a smile, Jegal Bo-hyun continued.\n“Only a monster could face a monster. However, that man turned into a monster 10 years ago.”\nThat was what Jegal Bu-hyun believed.\nThe fact that Chun Yeowun, who was a member of Sky Demon Order, had only come out now, meant that he reached Divine Master level not long ago.\nJegal Bo-hyun glanced at Chun Yeowun and said.\n“A baby monster cannot beat a full-grown monster!”\nBut Chun Yu-jang asked.\n“Ah, so?”\n‘!?’\nJegal Bo-hyun frowned.\nHe tried to provoke them, but this wasn’t the reaction he was hoping for.\nAt least, he expected them to be confused or angry.\nWith a smile, Chun Yu-jang said.\n“Right! A baby monster cannot beat a full-grown monster. How can a Divine Master defeat a Heavenly Master?”\n“What?”\nJegal Bo-hyun’s eyes widened with shock.\nHe couldn’t think anymore.\nSlash! Thud!\nIt was because his head was cut off.",

      "content": "The tip of the nose flinched at the disgusting smell.\nHundreds of bodies were scattered here and there on the road.\nAround 53 warriors were breathing in a ragged way among the corpses. They were of those who swore allegiance to the Sky Demon Order.\nOnly 53 out of 187 were left.\n‘What do we do?’\n‘Kuak...’\nTheir expressions had a mix of despair and shame. If they hadn’t killed more than 40% by attacking first, the warriors of the Murim Association would have annihilated them.\nOf course, they made great sacrifices too.\nBeep!\nThe general manager of the Yongchun group, who was filming this, stopped the recording.\nSince everything was recorded, it was now an inescapable situation.\n‘Is this the birth of a new Cult?’\nThey would all have to change their clan names once they came under the Sky Demon Order.\nFor example, the Mokyang Sword clan would become the Mokyang Sword Cult.\nSince all the executives of the Murim Association in Jinan city were eliminated, it would take time for proper registration.\n“Haaa... Haaa...”\nGan-ong was also among the warriors who were breathing hard. His body was full of wounds.\n‘Damn it...’\nHis expression was contorted, and the goggles he had on were cracking.\n‘What a mess.’\nThe information display window floating on the goggles stated that the transmission had failed.\nIt was probably because the goggles broke when he was fighting with the people.\nHe tried to report what was happening, but it was ruined.\n[Transmission rate 5%. Can’t send any more.]\nWith just 5%, it was impossible to know how much of the recording was transmitted.\n‘It would be nice if at least the useful videos were transmitted.’\nIf not, then the team members’ sacrifices will be vain.\nGan-ong’s gaze turned to a few people.\nTwo men were standing there with weary faces like him. They were his team members.\nIn the end, only three people, including him, survived.\n‘There are only three... whatever the outcome, we need to withdraw right away.’\nUntil yesterday, they were around 60 people in Jinan city.\nNow he wasn’t sure if he was lucky or not to have survived.\nBecause of the monster in front of him, his organization collapsed twice.\n‘He is completely insane.’\nGan-ong’s eyes turned somewhere else.\nOn one side of the road, there were dead bodies with ice swords stuck in them, the Gate Keepers’.\nThe monster showed no hesitation despite knowing they were under the National Defense Bureau.\nChun yeowun killed all the Gate Keepers by himself.\n‘Monster.’\nGan-ong saw it.\nIt happened while the warriors were fighting among each other.\nWith one gesture, the floating Ice Swords floating fell on the Gate Keepers.\nIt was a slaughter.\nHe also saw something which made him curious.\n‘Gravity Witch!’\nHe saw a woman in a white blouse and black skirt standing next to Chun Yeowun.\nThe SS-class Gate Keeper, Yu So-hwa.\nThe Gate Keepers rejoiced at her appearance and called her for help.\nHowever, she didn’t help them.\nIt was a shocking sight to see.\n‘How did he convince the Gravity Witch?’\nThe SS-class Gate Keeper was a powerhouse anyone would want to their side.\nIf she had joined the Yongchun Group, something must be up.\n‘I need to report everything.’\nThere were too many things to report. The video transmission had failed, so he had to report it directly.\n“Everyone focus.”\nAt that moment, the chairman of the Yongchun group, Chun Yu-jang, spoke loudly as if he was announcing something to the surviving warriors.\n“We confirmed your loyalty, so we welcome you as members of our Cult.”\nAt Chun Yu-jang’s words, the warriors’ faces darkened.\nOf course, they couldn’t be happy.\nIgnoring their reaction, Chun Yu-jang continued to speak.\n“Please listen carefully from now on.”\nChun Yu-jang explained how the bodies will be disposed of and what the surviving warriors will report to the National Defense Bureau.\nOnce the explanation was done, everyone started following the orders.\nThey started disposing of the bodies.\nIf it was done, the horrible day would end, and they would be able to return.\n‘Just a little longer.’\nGan-ong and the other two members pretended to obey everything.\nHowever, someone approached him.\n“Follow me for a moment.”\nIt was director Huan Myung-oh, one of the executives of the Yongchun Group.\nGan-ong was perplexed.\nHe didn’t do anything suspicious, so he couldn’t figure out why he was being called.\nHe wasn’t the only one.\n‘No...’\nThe other two members of his team were also called.\nGan-ong hastily thought of what they could do.\nThey would never make it out alive if they tried to escape.\nAnd their opponent looked like a Superior Master.\n‘Nothing can be done.’\nHe decided to follow him for now.\n“Alright.”\nGan-ong tried to take off the goggles he was wearing. But Huan Myung-oh stopped him.\n“Stop.”\n“I-I was just taking off the goggles.”\n“Don’t do anything and walk. You know what will happen if he thinks you’re doing anything suspicious.”\nPound! Pound!\nGan-ong’s heart pounded like crazy. He had to take off or break the goggles he was wearing right away.\nBut when Huan Myung-oh put his hand on his sword, he decided not to rash.\n‘Damn it!’\nIt would be nice if he could just remove the goggles.\nOnce they were destroyed, he could just commit suicide.\n‘I should have left the goggles in the car...’\nHe even thought of breaking down the phone in his hand.\nIt was right then.\nDrrrr! Drrrr!\n‘Ugh?’\nThe cell phone in his hand vibrated.\nGan-ong went bewildered.\nHuan Myung-oh put the sword on his neck and said.\n“Don’t move.”\nHe was cornered.\nHuan Myung-oh quickly pulled out the cellphone.\nThe recipient’s number was missing.\n“Old one? Tch! ”\nHuan Myung-oh was annoyed.\nThere was a USB-H type tracking device. However, it couldn’t connect to the old model phone of Gan-ong.\n“For now... tell them there is no problem.”\nClick!\nHuan Myung-oh, who received the call, put it near Gan-ong’s ear.\nOne nonsensical word, and he was ready to kill the man right away.\n‘Sigh.’\nGan-ong caught his breath and looked at Huan Myung-oh.\nHe thought that it was a good thing that he was given permission to answer the phone.\nAs spies, they had manual phones to work with.\nAnd when he answered, the first thing he said.\n“It’s me.”\n‘It’s me’ meant that the enemy had taken the phone.\nAnd the other side will cut off the contact. Gan-ong spoke according to the manual.\nHowever, Gan-ong put on a puzzled expression at the voice’s response.\nHuan Myung-oh frowned.\n“Don’t be foolish.”\nGan-ong shook his head.\n“... he, he is asking to change this.”\n“What?”\n“He wants to speak to your higher-ups.”\nGan-ong looked at Chun Yeowun, who was standing a little distance away.\nHuan Myung-oh\n“Fine.”\nChun Yeowun looked at the phone that Huan Myung-oh had brought to him.\nIn front of him now, gan-ong and two others were kneeling.\nChun Yeowun became aware of the existence of spies among the warriors who swore allegiance to him.\nBecause of how well trained he was, he was able to understand the energies of those who were in Jinan city hall.\nThat’s how he discovered the spies who were moving around, all thanks to that weapon.\n“Ultra Vibrating Sword.”\nIt was the black Ultra vibrating sword that uncovered the spies’ identities.\nThey didn’t use it right away, but when the crisis came, they ended up taking it out for a short period of time.\nAnd Chun Yeowun didn’t miss that.\nSo before trying to catch them and kill them, he wanted to investigate them further by freezing their bodies.\n‘Pretty bold.’\nHe didn’t expect that their superior would try to contact him first.\nChun Yeowun took the old cell phone.\n“Go on.”\n-Indeed, you are strong. Thanks for taking the call.\nAn altered voice.\nChun Yeowun clicked his tongue.\n“Tch, sneaky bastard. Trying to hide your voice.”\n-Well, we have secrets to keep. Huhu.\nPerhaps it was because of the anonymity, the caller had a relaxed attitude.\n“You don’t care if your subordinates die.”\nIt was like the voice didn’t care what happened to them.\nAt Chun Yeowun’s gesture, the arm joints of the three spies were broken.\nCrack!\n“Kuak!”\n“Ughh!”\nScreams erupted from their mouths.\nThe voice on the other side could hear it.\n-Huhu, you are an interesting person. You know that threats like that are pointless. They are just usable ones to us.\n“Is that so?”\nChun Yeowun put on the speakerphone.\nSo that the others would be able to listen to the altered voice too.\nTo ensure that the three spies would feel a sense of betrayal and give out information.\nAt Chun yeowun’s words, they made a determined expression showing that they wouldn’t say anything.\n-I told you, huhu. They are trained for such situations. If you try to get something out of those mouths...\nClick!\nThe sound of pressing a button.\n“Kuaak!”\nAt that moment, one of the three spies screamed, and soon, the body turned red and melted away.\nHang Yu-rin had sealed his blood points, but it seemed like their location was altered.\n-... this will happen. I hope you understand.\nThe altered voice said that the person could be disposed of at any time.\nIt spoke with a sense of triumph.\n-This kind of talk is meaningless, so let’s get into business.\n“Business?”\nChun Yeowun’s eyebrows rose.\nThe guy was really trying to pull Chun Yeowun’s strings.\n-You must have noticed that our side tried to hurt you at a request from someone.\n“It was very easy to know.”\n-There was no reason to hide it. You have taken care of yourself very well, and you are smart enough to notice that.\n“Then you need to pay the price for it.”\nChun Yeowun spoke in a cold voice.\nThe altered voice tensed up and said.\n-We will fix it. We have nothing to do with you. It was just commissioned work.\nChun Yeowun’s eyes narrowed.\nAfter all, they seemed to be moving under someone’s request.\n-Well, it was a short video, but you were amazing. The footage gave me a thrill.\nThe altered voice spoke in awe.\nIt seemed like he wanted to show his sincerity.\n-I also found something quite interesting.\nWith those words, the altered voice played something.\n-Lord Chun Ma! Please give us a chance to take revenge for the Cult!\nChun Yu-jang frowned when he heard his voice.\nHe didn’t know that a video was filmed and sent in that short period of time.\nIt was annoying that such information had fallen into another person’s hand.\n-There are two Chun ma. Very interesting, in the Sky Demon order, there were only two people who can be called legends.\n“Two people what shi...”\nShh!\n“Uhm!”\nChun Yeowun raised his hand to stop general manager Suh-jeong from speaking.\nAnd then narrowed his eyes.\n“You received the offer from Chun Woo-kyung.”\nThe altered voice didn’t respond for a moment and then said.\n-... this is. We made a mistake. We disclosed the information meant to be used for business purposes.\n“Business?”\n-Because it is the iron rule of this place to hold the confidentiality of the client. Of course, there are a few exceptions. Like changing cars mid-way?\n“You are saying you want to do business with me?”\n-Ku... you are quick-witted. We are also sure that you are the real one of the Two heads.\nThe altered voice spoke with certainty.\nWhen he first saw the sent video, he had gone blank for a second.\n-We would like to make a deal with the ‘real Chun Ma’.\n“Deal...”\n-You have an A-class core.\n“So?”\n-If you hand it over to us, then in return, we will stop the assassination request and give you the location of the person who commissioned us on you.\nThe voice showed the will to abandon Chun Woo-kyung and make a deal with Chun Yeowun.\n-Considering the rivalry for the Lord position, I don’t think the information we will give will be detrimental. But in a long term business with us, you might be able to reunite the Cult\ninto one...\n“How funny!\"\nChun Yeowun cut off the voice.\nAt that, the altered avoid asked.\n-What do you mean?\n“What are you doing trying to meddle into the affairs of the Cult?”\nChun Yeowun asked in a cold voice.\n-You must be upset. I hope you don’t misunderstand. Huhu, we just want to establish business relations with you.\n“No need.”\nChun yeowun refused.\n-...it will be difficult to find them without our help.\n“I’ll find you first.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, the voice laughed.\n-Hahahaah, this is the first time someone reacted like this. We asked for a deal, and you say you’ll find us? Does that seem possible?\n“Do you think that is impossible?”\nAt that, the voice said.\n-I am sorry but the old phones have no function but calling. Moreover, it is impossible to hack it with the tech in the world. Do you think that we are easy to find?\nThe voice boasted about its organization that surpassed the current tech.\nChun Yeowun laughed.\n“Why do you think I was listening to your shit all this time?”\nThe map was spread open in augmented reality.\nHundred of white marks curved and reduced to a range after bypassing the frequency.\n-Hahaha. This Chun ma seems to have a big delusion. You will never find us. I can even bet my...\n[The caller has been found]\nChun yeowun smiled and spoke.\n“You are pretty close. Taean City.”\n-!?\nFor an instant, the altered voice went stiff.\n“I’m coming to you now.”\nClick!\nThe call was disconnected.\n/strong>\nAn abandoned building in the northeast of Taean City.\nIn the basement, a man in his early 40s wearing a white researcher suit looked at the old cell phone and mumbled.\n“W-what just...”",

      "content": "Swosh!\nChun Yeowun was flying across the sky using the nano suit.\nSince the speed of flying was close to 13 Mach, flying without the suit would be impossible.\nBeep! Beep!\nThe position information was visualised on the ocular side of the nano suit.\nMt.Tae came into view, with a small city down its foot.\nTaean City.\nA wall stood tall at the city outskirts.\nUntil the gates were built, the city was famous for its sacred mountain. However, it was now nothing but a small town blocked by the wall.\nChun Yeowun was approaching the wall.\n‘Nano. Cover us.’\n[Activate the reverse panel shield.]\nAs the reverse panel shield was applied to the suit, it turned transparent.\n‘I will fly by myself.’\n[Understood]\nThe magnetic field particles which were spraying from his feet stopped.\nChun Yeowun raised his energy and flew by himself.\nThe last time he crossed the barrier, there was a conflict with the Defense department as he got caught in the infrared cams.\nSo Chun Yeowun decided to learn from his mistakes.\n[Crossing barrier in 50 meters, 30, 10 meters.]\nSwoosh!\nChun Yeowun passed through the wall.\nThere was a concern, but with the technology of this era, he was sure that the cams couldn’t record the panel reflection.\nAn abandoned building northeast of Taean city.\nThere were numerous monitors inside the basement. They were all showing underground tunnels.\nThe high-speed trains, which travel through the tunnels, still operated.\nThere was a man in his early 40s carefully watching the images on his monitor.\nThe images were transmitted from the hacked CCTV cams installed in the tunnels.\nTaktakta!\nFeeling nervous, he couldn’t take his eyes off the tunnels connected to Jinan city.\nOn the signboards of the tunnel, the red light was flickering.\nThe man who was looking at it sighed.\n‘Stupid. The tunnel to Jina isn’t operating as the Gate there is open. What am I so worried about?’\nHe looked at the broken old cell phone put on the table.\nThe man was the owner of the altered voice that spoke with Chun Yeowun.\n‘Maybe I don’t know what I got myself into.’\nHe couldn’t get the word ‘I am coming’ out of his mind.\nBut thinking about it, it seemed stupid.\nTaean was close to Jinan, but it would take 40 minutes by train.\nAnd with the Gate Warning being issued in Jinan, all modes of transport were halted.\n“Researcher Seo.”\nThe door opened, and someone called him.\nA man in his late 30s with a grey suit and white hair.\n“As requested, all information has been sent to the head office. All stored data has been formatted and deleted.”\nThe one called researcher Seo stood up and said.\n“Good job. Did you destroy the documents too?”\n“Everything has been burned. If we put the non-disposable research materials in vehicles, we can move.”\n“Got it. The last thing is the monitor room. Let me know once everything is ready.”\nAfter giving the order, the researcher sat in front of the monitor again.\nHowever, the white-haired man didn’t leave the room. He went closer and said.\n“Researcher Seo. Still, there is one month left for us to move base. Is it okay to do this when the approval from the head office is still pending?”\nThe man followed the order, but he disagreed with it. Even if the person in charge was the one who made the decision without asking the head office, everyone in the place could be held responsible.\n“We never know.”\nAt researcher Seo’s words, the man asked.\n“Are you doing this because of the target?”\n“Just in case.”\nThe white-haired man sighed.\n“Even if the Alpha hazard entity was defeated and the Gate was closed, it will take two to three days for the warning to be lifted. We still have time to wait for the approval.”\n“It is up to me to decide that.”\n“... aren’t you too scared? Don’t you trust our security system?”\nThe white-haired man asked.\nHe couldn’t understand why the researcher was so nervous.\n“You were next to me when we saw the video.”\nHe saw the video sent from Jinan city.\nOnly 2% of the video was transmitted, the first part was 10 seconds long, and the second was 8 seconds.\nThe first showed Chun Yeowun using a hundred Ice Swords.\n“... it was extraordinary.”\nThat was something anyone would admit.\nHe got goosebumps all over his body when he watched it.\nResearcher Seo bit his lip.\n“Do you know why I became a researcher? It is because this feels great. If there is any risk, I have the chance to avoid it.”\n“It is also the job of the security officer to protect you. And we have a manual for dealing with monsters.”\nHearing that, researcher Seo shut his mouth. It was because he knew that the pride of the security officer was hurt.\n‘This is why fighters always...’\nDespite being the chief security officer here, the researcher knew that the man had been to several battles in his life, including the Gate War.\nBut researcher Seo was adamant.\n“Get ready. There is no change in my decision.”\nIn response to the stubborn attitude, the security officer sighed again.\n“Fine...”\nKung!\nA vibration hit all over the place.\nShocked, researcher Seo turned and looked at the CCTV installed outside the building.\n‘!!!’\nLooking at that, researcher Seo’s face hardened.\nThe CCTV was showing someone floating in the air outside the building.\nIt was Chun Yeowun.\nHis black coat was flapping as he stood mid-air.\n“H-how?”\nResearcher Seo trembled at what he had just seen. He did guess that the man would come.\nBut he expected the man to come in 3 days at the shortest, not in 30 minutes.\nThe security officer’s eyes shook as he looked at the screen.\n“Hehe... is flying in the sky?”\n“No way...”\nResearcher Seo jumped up and shouted.\n“No way! Did he fly here!?”\nIt was unbelievable.\nAfter the Gates opened in the world, mankind lost control over the sky.\nHumans lost their planes and had no choice but to dig underground tunnels for the sake of movement.\n“How could thi...”\nThe security officer hurriedly spoke.\n“Researcher, go to the safe room on the second basement floor.”\n“To the safe room?”\n“The fact that he is still there means that he hasn’t broken the shield. We will activate the defence system, so head to the safe room.”\nAs he said, Chun Yeowun seemed to be blocked by something on the screen. It was a camouflage shield around the building.\nIt did look like there was nothing around the building, but Chun Yeowun must have noticed it.\nResearcher Seo asked.\n“Can it stop him?”\n“The shield can withstand a force of tens of thousands of tons. It will not break.”\nThe security officer shouted at researcher Seo.\n“Hurry!”\n“Ah, yes!”\nAt the urging, he ran out of the monitor room.\nWhen the professor left, the security officer exhaled deeply and pressed the radio on his waist.\n“Activate the defence system. All security personnel to the location!”\n— Roger!\nThe security officer looked at Chun Yeowun on the monitor and muttered.\n“Even if he is a monster, he is still a human. He could never be compared to a hazard entity. This stronghold was built to withstand even a Gate situation.”\nIn the video, he did see Chun yeowun use the Air Swords.\nBut he thought that breaking the shield would be impossible.\nAt that moment, blue light formed on Chun Yeowun’s hand.\nSlash!\nChun Yeowun blasted the sword qi at the shield.\nClaash! Woong!\nThe sword qi collided with the shield but couldn’t penetrate it and scattered in all directions.\nThis was the advantage of the dome-shaped shield.\nEven if a strong energy attacked it, the shield could disperse it upon impact.\n“Right.”\nThe security officer smiled.\nEven with a shock of that level, only wind blew and the shield stood still.\n‘We don’t even need any kind of internal defence.’\nHe thought that Chun Yeowun would just give up after failing to penetrate the shield.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun suddenly distanced himself from the shield.\n‘Is he going to use it?’\nHe saw Chun Yeowun use Sky Flash in the video.\nThe security office instructed.\n“Increase the shield energy to max.”\n— Roger!\nOnce the instructions were given, the energy shield grew stronger.\nCrackle\nThe shield’s energy consumption was high, but it didn’t matter. The security officer smiled and said.\n“Do it if you can.”\nAt that time, Chun Yeowun held out his hand.\nIt was holding a sword.\nThe security guard looked closer.\n‘What? That?’\nThe security officer, who didn’t know about the invisible sword, watched curiously.\nChun Yeowun grabbed the invisible sword and flew up.\nHe climbed higher than the shield, and then aimed the sword down.\n‘What? Are you sure you want to do that?’\nAt that moment, black flame rose from the invisible sword.\nWheik!\n“Is that... flame?”\nThe momentum of the black flame was unusual.\nNot just the sword, but everything around Chun Yeowun was covered in the black flame.\nSoon, the entire area was engulfed in it.\n— Security officer!\nThe voice of the shield administrator was heard.\n“What is it?”\n— A tremendous amount of energy is condensing over the shield.\n“What?”\nThere were several detectors in the security room.\nSince it was the same detector used by the National defence, it could measure the energy pretty well.\n“To what extent?”\n— This amount of energy would be comparable to an explosion of 100 ton...\nIt was then.\nChun Yeowun pointed the invisible sword towards the shield.\nAt that moment, the black flames erupted from the sword’s tip and hit the shield.\nKwang!\nThe moment it collided with the shield, a tremendous bang was heard, and the screen was distorted.\n“... nonsense!”\nThe shield couldn’t disperse the energy.\nPanicked, the security officer shouted.\n“Stop! Stop him! Even if you have to use all the energy, stop...”\nKwak!\nAt that moment, a loud sound was heard.\nThe moment the security officer tried to get up.\nA scorching heat entered the building.\nKwanng!\nResearcher Seo was inside the safe room in the 2nd basement.\nIt was very safe there. The room was made of a special alloy and was 1m thick.\nHowever, it was frustrating since he couldn’t know what was going on outside.\n“Damn it!”\nBecause they constantly changed their location, they never installed CCTV cams in the safe room.\nThe security officers were strong fighters and could even handle a Gate war.\n‘Huh. Let’s just trust them and wait. Whoa!’\nHe took a deep breath and calmed himself.\nResearcher Seo closed his eyes.\nIf he waited and meditated, the result would come out soon...\nClash! Slash!\n“Huh!”\nHe was startled by the sound of something being cut, so he opened his eyes.\nSparks!\nResearcher Seo was at a loss for what to do.\nA shining light made him frown.\n‘’Isn’t this the basement?’\nHe looked up, blinking his eyes several times.\nShockingly, there was a hole in the ceiling and light was coming through.\n“How the hell...”\nTak!\nSomeone grabbed him by the neck.\n“Kuak!”\nResearcher Seo’s face turned white.\nChun Yeowun looked at him and said.\n“You are the one?”",

      "content": "A pungent smell wafted everywhere.\nA burning smell.\nDemon and Fire.\nThe unification of two spirit beasts’ powers, the corrupted Imoogi and the Flame Qilin.\nA destructive energy unfolded with an invisible sword.\nThe unbreakable dome-shaped shield stayed untouched as the sword pierced through the middle of the building.\nOnly the exterior of the building was blown away, and the thinnest walls remained.\nEverything was damaged by heat.\n‘He blew up the entire building but not the security system?’\nResearcher Seo was confused.\nAs a result, those in charge of internal security could do nothing but get annihilated.\nChun Yeowun was happy.\n‘The power is out.’\nChun Yewun raised the level of the attack in order to overcome the shield’s strength.\nHowever, the problem was that he raised his power several levels to be able to remove the annoying obstacles.\nEverything was destroyed, except for the shield.\nHe was worried he might have killed the man too, but fortunately, he found him hiding inside a safe room on the second basement floor.\nChun Yeowun asked.\n“Are you the one?”\n‘Ah!’\nResearcher Seo remembered that he had altered his voice during the call with Chun Yeowun.\nHe decided to act like he wasn’t the one.\n“Kuak. Wh... what are you talking about? I am just working here as a researcher?”\n“Researcher?”\n“Right!”\nBecause his life was at stake, he was ready to do anything to survive.\n“Hmm, is that so?”\nAs Chun Yeowun looked half-pleased, he pleaded.\n“I am just a researcher. I know nothing. Please let me go.”\nHe seemed desperate.\nHe tried to look as pitiful as possible.\nChun Yeowun said.\n“You mean, you are just an ordinary researcher?”\n“Y-yes! So please have mercy on...”\nGrab!\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun violently grabbed his hand.\n“Ugh!”\nAnd broke his wrist.\nCrack!\n“Kuaaak!”\nChun Yeowun spoke in a harsh voice.\n“Researcher? Hiding all alone in this thick room?”\nIt was nonsense.\nThere was no reason for a researcher to hide.\n‘No! No! If this crazy monster finds out who I am. I am done for.’\n“Kuaak. The reason I’m hiding here is because I am a researcher... because I am working on an important project.”\nEven in the midst of pain, researcher Seo didn’t stop lying.\nIt was better to lie than to die.\n“The person who spoke to you is at the base. I also don’t know if he is alive or not.”\nHe was trying to make Chun Yeowun give up on chasing him.\n“So, you are saying you’re not him?”\n“Y-yes!”\nChun Yeowun looked at him, and then swung his sword against the wall.\nStrangely, words were engraved on the wall.\nChachach!\nChun Yeowun pointed to the wall and said.\n“Read it.”\n‘!?’\nEmbarrassment was drawn all over the researcher’s face.\nThe words Chun Yeowun had engraved on the wall were the words he uttered during the phone call.\nHe wanted to uncover his identity through the tone or phrasing.\n‘This... this venomous bastard!’\nHe thought that Chun Yeowun had already believed him, but no.\nConfused, he read the words.\nIf he had hesitated, Chun Yeowun would have become more suspicious.\n“It will be difficult to find them without our help.”\nHe spoke in a different tone than usual.\n‘Without a machine, there is no way he can identify the tone of an altered voice!’\nOr so he thought.\n[Pronunciation and tone are 80% identical.]\nChun Yeowun had Nano.\nThere was no way that the usual way of speaking could be mistaken with a slight voice change.\nChun Yeowun shook his head.\n“You! You are better at lying than I thought.”\n‘Uh?’\nChun Yeowun swung the sword.\nAnd.\nSlash! Tuk!\nThe cut-off arm fell to the ground.\n“Kuaaak! My arm! Arm!”\nThe pain was incomparable to that of a broken wrist.\nHe didn’t have the mental strength to endure this kind of pain.\nHe screamed till he passed out.\n“Ugh!”\nHowever, the moment Chun Yeowun injected thunder qi into his body, he woke up again.\nCrackle!\n“Ugh!”\nChun Yeowun looked at him.\n“Didn’t I tell you I would find you?”\n‘Eikk!’\nCompletely terrified, researcher Seo begged like crazy.\n“Spare me! Spare me! I-I have sinned! Please!”\n“What did you say about the Cult?”\n“I made a mistake. Without knowing it, I made a mistake... please... ah!”\nResearcher Seo, who was pleading, suddenly remembered something.\n“If you spare me, I will tell you how to find him.”\nHe didn’t know everything, but he thought that Chun Yeowun would be interested in the information he could give.\nHowever, his neck was grabbed harder.\nGrab!\n“Cough!”\n“Do you think I would bargain with you?”\nIt felt like his neck was about to crack.\nUnable to overcome the fear of dying, he said.\n“Sha-shanghai... Chun... Chun Woo-kyung... kuak... a business partner.”\n“Shanghai?”\nShanghai was in the middle part of the trading city.\nGrab!\n“Cough!”\n“Business? Then he has a base?”\n“Ch-Chun Woo-kyung... he... he... he is too careful... constantly changing the base...”\nChun Woo-kyung was running an organization. Unlike the other two factions, he constantly moved the base from one place to another.\n“Huh. So how do I catch him?”\n“Three months... once... in Shanghai... Chun Woo-kyung... holds a meeting at the Hayden Hotel with... business partners... foreign countries... . Next one... next month 4th...”\nThere were 10 days left.\nWith this kind of information, he could catch the man.\nGrab!\n“No lies?”\n“Ahhh! No!”\n“Great. So now, let’s talk about your organization.”\nAccording to Nano, the Ultra vibration sword was a major military tech that wasn’t given to the National Guard until the middle of the 22nd century.\nBut these people had tech ahead of time.\nIn addition, the remodeling of the human body and the modification of the blood vessels were also not of this time.\n“The name of your organization.”\n“T-that..”\nGrab!\n“Kuak!”\n“You can always keep your mouth shut if you want to die.”\nChun Yeowun looked indifferent.\nResearcher Seo, who was at a loss for words, eventually said.\n“We are m...”\nIt was then.\nWoong!\nStartle!\nChun yeowun looked at the hole in the ceiling.\nA change in the energy of nature occurred around them.\n‘The energy around is scattered.’\nChun Yeowun narrowed his eyes.\nWhen he came to this age, he realized that the energy of nature was significantly smaller than his time.\n“This...”\nResearcher Seo mumbled as he noticed something.\n“EV field!”\n“What?”\nThe researcher was about to answer Chun Yeowun’s question, when...\nTatata!\nThe sound of a gun being fired.\nChun Yeowun stretched out his hand.\nHe meant to block the bullets.\nHowever, due to the phenomenon which dispersed the energy, the energy couldn’t form.\n“Tch.”\nChun Yeowun stepped forward.\nKwang!\nHe made the cracked floor rise upwards.\nPapak!\nThe bullet was blocked.\n“Damn it!”\nA small voice.\nWhen Chun Yeowun looked in its direction, he saw someone aiming his gun at him.\n“There were people alive?”\nHe didn’t feel any life energy other than researcher Seo’s.\nChun Yeowun reached out and tried to pull the man.\nHowever, due to the anomaly, the energy didn’t flow normally.\n[Energy has been scattered.]\n‘I know. How annoying.’\nTatatak!\nAt that time, the guy on the ceiling aimed his gun at Chun Yeowun and tried to fire again.\n“Fine, let’s go there.”\nGrab!\n“Huh?”\nChun Yeowun jumped up.\nResearcher Seo was puzzled when he saw himself fly up.\nPhat!\n“Ugh!”\nPak!\nChun Yeowun, who stepped lightly, arrived above at once.\nBecause of the sun, he couldn’t make out his appearance, but the man had terrible burns all over his body.\nBut still alive.\n‘A mod?’\nChun Yeowun could see the man’s body slowly regenerating.\nThe man, who was running away, finally stopped in front of large trucks loaded with boxes made of steel.\n“Given up on running?”\nClick!\nThe man opened the safety lock of the truck.\nResearcher Seo, who saw that, shouted.\n“Wh-what are you doing? Have you lost it? If you, If you open that!”\nPhat!\nChun Yeowun thought that the man had a plan and decided to stop him.\nBut the man was quicker with pressing the red cross button.\nTak!\nIn an instant, Chun Yeowun moved there.\nSlash!\nAfter cutting off the man’s arm, he pressed the button again.\nTak!\nNothing happened.\nIt seemed like pressing the button again had stopped it.\n“What are you trying to do?”\nChun Yeowun asked.\nThe burnt man had injured vocal cords, so his voice didn’t come out.\nChun Yeowun looked at his mouth and narrowed his eyes.\nFrom the mouth’s movement alone, he could figure out the words.\n‘Late?’\nAt that moment.\nSrrr!\nFrom the back of the truck, something appeared.\nA naked woman with a transparent-like body and fluttering purple hair.\n‘What?’\nChun Yeowun was puzzled as the woman ran towards them with a face full of anger.\nThe target seemed to be the burnt man.\nChun Yeowun tried to stop her by blocking her way, but the purple woman’s body turned transparent and passed through Chun Yeowun.\n“This?”\nSoon the man was pierced.\nActually, her hand grabbed the man’s heart.\nPuck! Crack!\nShe ripped his heart out.\nAnd then, she turned around and kicked Chun Yeowun.\nPuck!\nChun yeowun crossed his arms and blocked it.\nA pit about 10 meters in diameter was dug in the ground where he supported his body.\nWoong!\n‘What power!’\nWoong!\nShockingly, Chun Yeowun was pushed five steps back.\nHe didn’t sense any use of internal energy.\nWhen Chun Yeowun looked at her, the woman opened her mouth with a surprised look.\n“You are pretty good for a mere human.”",

      "content": "Grab!\nResearcher Seo shut his mouth.\nDeep inside, he wanted to curse out.\n‘Crazy bastard! If you want to die, die alone! Why do all this bullshit!’\nIt was like the man detonated a bomb hoping everyone would die.\nDespite being on the outskirts, they released it within the wall. It was the worst situation.\n‘Stupid bastard! Releasing a monster to catch a monster!’\nThe released monster was more than capable of destroying the whole Taean City.\nAll of the security systems, including the shield around the base, were made in case the monster escaped.\nAnd since Chun Yeowun broke down most security systems, there was no way to stop the monster.\n‘Can this one stop that bitch?’\nResearcher Seo looked at Chun Yeowun.\nHe saw that Chun Yeowun was pushed back with the kick.\nDespite looking like a human, that woman wasn’t something he could deal with.\nSwish!\nThe purple-haired naked woman turned her head and looked at him.\n“You.”\n‘Ugh!’\nTerrified, researcher Seo tried to step back.\nBut he couldn’t.\n‘D-dizzy.’\nChun Yeowun had stopped the bleeding of his arm by sealing the blood points, but it still had its consequences.\nIt was the worst situation as he couldn’t run away.\n“Doing an experiment?”\nThe purple-haired woman looked away from Chun Yeowun and tried to move towards the researcher.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun intervened.\nSwosh!\n“He is mine.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, the purple-haired woman smiled bitterly.\n“Human. You think you can stop me?”\nAs soon as she said that, she ran towards the researcher.\nIt wasn’t light footwork. It was real speed.\n‘Ahh, I see.’\nChun Yeowun created a sword qi.\nA simple attack of sword qi had passed through her body before, so this time, he created sword qi with condensed energy.\n“Will this go through?”\nChun Yeowun released it.\nShoo!\nHowever, the sword qi was immediately dispersed in the air.\nBecause of the anomaly of dispersing the energy, Chun Yeowun couldn’t use the attack.\n‘This is so annoying!’\nThe control on qi was dispersed.\nIn the end, it seemed like he had to go for close combat.\nMeanwhile, the purple-haired woman approached Chun Yeowun.\n‘Then I will do it!’\nChun Yeowun used the sword with energy to stab the woman.\nSwosh!\nAt that moment. Her body turned transparent, and the sword passed through her.\nShhh!\n‘Condensed sword qi too?’\nChun Yeowun frowned.\nHe didn’t think that sword qi with condensed energy would pass.\nAt that moment, she aimed for Chun Yeowun’s heart.\n“Can’t kill me, human.”\nShhh!\nThe moment her transparent hand passed through his body and tried to grab his heart, Chun Yeowun spread the distance.\n“Where are you running away?”\nPhat!\nShe kicked her feet and narrowed the distance.\nShe reached right in front of Chun Yeowun in an instant.\nThe woman seemed like she didn’t master martial arts, making it hard to believe that she could achieve such incredible speed.\n“You can’t get away from me, human.”\nThinking that she captured him, she smiled.\nBut.\nShh!\n“Huh?”\nAs Chun Yeowun’s body dispersed, something appeared behind it.\nIt was an illusion.\nDespite being a human, Chun Yeowun was beyond the limits of human beings.\nWoong!\nA blurry invisible sword emerged in his hand.\nUnlike sword qi, which was made of internal energy, invisible swords have a power surpassing internal energy.\nShhh!\n‘1st formation of Sword Force of Sky Demon.’\n24 Demon Sword was unfolded with the invisible sword.\nChun Yeowun attacked her.\nChachacha!\n‘No!’\nChun Yeowun was shocked.\nHe thought if the sword was made of pure qi, then it would definitely hurt her, but even the invisible sword passed through her.\nWatching that, the researcher’s face darkened.\n‘No use. The monster’s phasing ability breaks down much smaller than the atomic unit. There is nothing we can do.’\nThrough numerous experiments, he tried to uncover the secret of her phasing.\nIt was because, if such a tech could be understood, it was possible to create the strongest biological weapon able to easily subdue the best talented warriors.\nHowever, no progress was made as it was an ability unexplainable with human science.\n‘There is only one way to stop...’\nTheir organization discovered a way to capture that monster.\nAlthough it couldn’t kill her, it could stop her.\nThe problem was that the base was devastated. And there was no way that any device survived.\n‘I need to run away.’\nResearcher Seo stood up staggering.\nThere was no other way than to contact the base and let them know that the monster had been released.\nHe wanted to move when Chun Yeowun was still fighting her.\n“Huh!”\nBang!\nHer fists slammed the floor.\nAt that moment, the floor sank down.\nNot just the phasing ability, but she seemed to have tremendous physical power as well.\n‘Definitely not human.’\nIt did have a human form, but the skeleton was different.\nThere was a high probability that the inside of the body was an internal structure completely different from that of humans.\n‘Something from the Gate?’\nThe only one who knew about it was researcher Seo, the only survivor now.\nChun Yeowun looked at the researcher, who staggered towards the ruined base.\nThe purple-haired woman noticed it too.\n“Huh. Human, I will take him down first and then you.”\nShe was able to evade the attacks, but she wasn’t able to handle Chun Yeowun, so she ran for the next target.\n‘No can do.’\nChun Yeowun overtook her, thinking he should catch the researcher first.\nIt was then.\n“Caught you. Human!”\nAs Chun Yeowun caught him, she put her hand on the floor. At that moment, the floor was dyed in purple,\nWoong!\n“This!”\nSwush!\nThe floor turned transparent, and Chun Yeowun fell down.\nChun Yeowun kicked the air and tried to climb up, but.\nTak!\nThe moment she released her hand, the floor went back to its original state.\n“Kal kal kal, stupid human.”\nShe smiled.\nIt seemed like she could pass on the ability of phasing to other things too.\nIt was just that the range wasn’t wide.\n“Die right there.”\nPhat!\nWith those words, the woman headed to capture researcher Seo.\nHer anger was raging as he had been tested for a long time for experiments.\nAnd finding the man wasn’t difficult as the place was all destroyed.\nResearcher Seo was rummaging through something.\n“There you are.”\nShe wiggled her fingers and walked towards him.\nNot caring about anything else, she only wanted to kill the man who experimented on her body.\nShe would torture him until he asked her to kill him.\nSrrrn!\nHer hands turned transparent.\n“I will pull out your organs one after another and watch you die.”\nIt was the moment researcher Seo turned around and pointed something at her.\n“S-stop!”\nA small machine gun.\nThe moment she saw the machine gun, which was connected to something like an output device, her expression distorted terribly.\nResearcher Seo pulled the trigger.\nPach-kik!\nBlue sparks fired from the machine gun.\nThe woman, who was 6 steps away, was struck directly by it.\nCrackle!\nShhh!\nWhen her body was electrocuted, her hands, which turned transparent, returned to their original state.\n‘Yes! It worked!’\nResearcher Seo’s face brightened.\nBut that feeling didn’t last long.\nTak!\n“Ugh?”\nHe thought that she wouldn’t be able to move as she couldn’t use the phasing, but she stepped forward.\n“H-how? No...”\nWhen he looked at the outer unit connected to the gun, he noticed that one point was left open.\nAs the base was destroyed, the power was insufficient.\n“Damn it...”\nThe box was supposed to hold the A-class core.\nSince the base was destroyed, there was no way that it could work well.\n“Let’s kill you.”\nShe took strides with an angry face and snatched the machine gun.\nShe then smashed it.\nCrack!\n“How dare you! Huh!”\nCrackle!\nHer body was still showing sparks.\nHer hand reached out to researcher Seo’s abdomen.\nGrab!\nShe grabbed something.\n“Kuaaak!”\nThe pain was so excruciating that he groaned and twisted his body.\n“A human being cannot survive without even one organ missing, right? I’ll take one out.”\n“Kuak!, please! Please!”\nResearcher Seo begged.\nFeeling delighted, she tried to search for something in his body with a red face.\n“The longest one!”\nSwos!\n“Kuaaaak!”\nWhen she pulled out her hand, his duodenum came out.\nShe tried to pull it out with force to hurt him.\nIt was then.\nGrrrr!\nThe ground shook violently.\nShe looked puzzled at what was happening.\nKwak!\nA hand came out and grabbed her left ankle.\n“W-what!”\nShocked, she tried to use her phasing ability and move.\nAt that moment.\nCrackle!\nA huge shock occurred.\nThe machine gun couldn’t even be compared to this.\n“Kyaaal!”\nUnable to use her phasing, she staggered as her ability stopped working.\nShocked, she stomped on the floor.\nBang!\nAnd soon, the floor cracked and someone came out.\n“Y-you?”\nChun Yeowun.\nCovered in dirt and mud, Chun Yeowun lifted the woman’s body by her ankles and.\nSwish!\n“Ugh!”\nHe hit her body on the floor.\nBang! Bang! Bang! Bang!\n“Ack! Ack! Ack! Ack!”\nHer face darkened.\nShe didn’t realize what had just happened.\n“How dare a human!”\nShe clenched her teeth and tried to kick Chun Yeowun’s head.\nPak!\nChun yeowun raised his left hand and blocked it.\nKwang! Crack!\nThe floor where Chun Yeowun was standing cracked, but he didn’t even budge.\nTremble!\nHer feet were trembling.\n“Stopped it?”\nShe thought he would bounce off. It was a kick that could produce power close to hundred tons.\n“Did you think I couldn’t stop it?”\nShe didn’t know it, but Chun Yeowun had the strongest internal energy.\n“How can a mere human do this?”\n“Human in every line. How annoying.”\nCrackle!\nIn an instant, Chun Yeowun’s fist hit her face.\nPuck!\n“Ack!”\nBang!\nDue to the blow loaded with thunder qi, she bounced back.\nNot being able to use phasing anymore, she got up with an angry face.\n“Y-you are only one human...”\nShe was losing it.\nThis situation was different from when she was captured.\nAt that time, she was exhausted, and she was captured only after two days of fighting with hundreds of people equipped with lightning equipment.\nCrackle!\nChun Yeowun walked and asked.\n“Bitch. Do you have any other ability to show?”\n“What?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s question, her expression was distorted.\nIt was as if Chun Yeowun was testing her.\n‘Cheeky human!’\nShe was about to get angry, but Chun Yeowun’s next words were weird.\n“I think that ability is quite useful.”\n“What nonsense are you talking about? Human!”\n“I just need to tame you and use it!”\n“How dare you!”\nHearing those words, her eyes turned red.\nShe felt more angry than the time when she was restrained.\nIt was then.\nWoong!\nThe remaining power in the base was exhausted.\nAs a result, the EV field which surrounded the perimeter was also terminated.\nThe energy which was being scattered stopped, and the place was back to its original state.\nThe corners of her lips turned into a smile.\n“Human. I will make you regret what you said.”\nHer body floated.\nWoong!\nShe stretched out her arms as her purple hair fluttered in the air. Energy began to condense from all directions and turned into a sphere of white light.\nGoo!\nHundred of white-colored spheres with energy appeared.\n“As the restraints on my power are now released, you, human, will never be able to get out alive!”\nShe wasn’t able to use the full extent of her power because of the EV field.\nAfter being freed from it, she was able to manipulate the energy freely, and now she wanted to kill the human in front of her.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun’s expression didn’t seem to change.\n‘Why isn’t he scared?’\nDespite the hundred energy balls, he looked relaxed.\nAt that time, Chun Yeowun stretched out his hand into the air and said.\n“Right. Being restricted was making me frustrated.”\n“What?”\nCrackle!\nThe sound of sparks was heard.\nStartle.\nFor a moment, she turned her head at the sound of thunder she felt behind her.\nSwords of thunder qi had covered the air above her.\n‘W-what the hell is...’\nIt was a terrifying sight.\nAs her confidence was shattered, she mumbled in a terrified trembling voice.\n“You, are you really a human?”",

      "content": "Crackle! Crackle!\nThe majestic swords with lightning sparking on them, was a spectacular scene.\nThe blue sparks that flashed with lightning were dazzling.\n‘It’s happening.’\nIt was the first time that thunder qi was being loaded into Sky Flash.\nAs Chun Yeowun had absorbed the core of the five spirits, he could freely use the attributes of flame, ice, thunder, wind and the corrupted demonic energy.\nThe thunder qi was gained after absorbing the core of the dragon turtle.\nIf it had to be given a name, then he decided to call it Thunder Qi Sky Flash.\n“How can a human have this power...”\nThe naked woman with purple hair looked up at the sky with shock.\nMaking a hundred energy balls was one thing.\n‘Hmm, I need to attack first!’\nShe hurriedly reached out to Chun Yeowun.\nAnd then, hundreds of white energy balls rushed towards Chun Yeowun.\nShush! Swosh!\nIf Chun yeowun died, then his floating swords would disappear.\nSo she was in a hurry.\n“Die!!”\nChun yeowun looked at her with a sullen look and lowered his hand.\nAt that moment, some of the swords fell down like raindrops.\nChachacha!\nThe swords moved as if they had targets and hit the energy balls.\nBang! Bang! Bang!\nThe energy balls which were hit exploded.\nIn an instant, the energy balls aiming for Chun Yeowun were destroyed by the swords.\nWith an overwhelming majority.\n“Y-you monstrous bastard!”\nSuddenly, she changed the way she called Chun Yeowun.\nFrom human to monster.\n‘I need to run away. He isn’t someone I can defeat.’\nShe turned around.\nIf her ability of phasing could be used, she would have no rival at all.\nBut her opponent now was a monster.\n“Someone told me it was no use running away.”\nShh!\nChun Yeowun reached out to her.\nThe remaining swords flew to her at once.\nSwosh!\n“Kyak!”\nStartled, she tried to move away at full speed. However, the swords’ speed was like a flash.\nAnd it hit like lightning.\nCrackle!\nA sword struck her body.\n“Ack!”\nAs the sword pierced her body, her body trembled.\nWithout missing the chance, the other thunder swords rushed to her and pierced her.\nPuck! Puck! Puck!\nThe thunder swords were made of lightning.\nAs soon as they pierced her, electricity flowed through her body.\nChik! Chik!\n“Kuaaak!”\nShe was being electrocuted mid-air and then fell down with a scream.\nThud!\nAs she fell to the ground, her body convulsed.\nThe lightning made her unable to move or use the phasing ability.\nSeeing that, Chun Yeowun narrowed his eyes.\n‘Unique.’\nA total of seventeen swords had pierced her arms, legs and shoulder, but she didn’t bleed.\nRather, something like a purple haze was coming out from the pierced areas.\nIt was clear that the woman wasn’t a human.\n“Kuuaak!”\nShe was unconscious, but she kept groaning like a person on the verge of starvation.\nChun Yeowun reached out his palm at her head.\n‘Nano. Try to scan.’\n[Understood.]\nChun Yeowun was curious about her body structure.\nA red light was coming out of Chun Yeowun’s palm as he scanned her body.\nChun Yeowun was shocked when he looked at her body in augmented reality.\n‘Completely different.’\nShe didn’t have blood. In addition, the skeleton seemed different from a human.\nThe number of joints itself was more than hundreds in one arm.\nIt was a structure to mitigate the shock when received.\nThe tendons of muscles and the source of strength, were also woven in a form more complex than that of humans.\n‘Body for battle purpose?’\nIt looked like a natural combat type.\nWithout any training, it was the perfect body.\nHowever, that wasn’t what shocked Chun Yeowun.\n‘No core.’\nThere was no core in the body.\nIt certainly didn’t look like a living thing from earth.\nThere was only one person who could know the answer.\nShhh!\nChun yeowun disappeared.\nA man with a pale face was sitting wide-eyed at the entrance of the ruined base. It was researcher Seo.\nThe way he was holding onto his organs which were pulled out from his stomach, was just horrible.\nIt wasn’t strange if he stopped breathing.\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun appeared in front of him.\nResearcher Seo raised his head.\n“Really nice... you are.”\nHe watched Chun Yeowun subdue her.\nHe was his enemy, but he still admired him.\nIt was because he could subdue the woman without any equipment.\n“I think the word alien would go well for you. Cough... but I am out of time.”\nWas it because he felt himself losing his life?\nHe knew that his body was beyond repairable.\nTak!\nChun Yeowun put his palm on his chest.\nAs internal energy was pushed in, researcher Seo could feel his body warm up.\n“Even then... it wouldn’t... be of... any use. Haa...”\n“I have a lot to ask of you.”\nStared at Chun Yeowun, researcher Seo shook his head.\n“You are a wonderful person. To get what you want from someone, you pull it out even from a person who isn’t a threat to you anymore.”\nThere was no reason to hold back information when he was on the verge of death.\nDying was something the organization was used to.\nBut maybe because he was on the verge of death? He looked at Chun Yeowun with a pale face and said.\n“... ask me. As long as... I’m alive... haa... haa...”\n“What is that woman?”\n/strong>\nAt Chun Yeowun’s question, the researcher struggled to open his mouth.\n“Ga...te... Gate entity.”\n“I know that. But why is the being that came out the Gate in human form? Oh? And, why doesn’t it have a core?”\nChun Yeowun didn’t see many Gate entities. However, he saw two who had human-level intelligence.\n“Gate monsters are classified into three types...”\nThe first was the individual type.\nThe most common case, a form of monsters that come out at once.\nThe second was the hazard type.\nOnce they came out, the entire area would become hell.\nThe last one was the special type.\nThe other two types of Gate entities could be defeated by destroying their core.\nBut the special type was different.\n“When they come out the Gate, the Gate just closes.”\nAnd it was known that they didn’t have a core.\nThe special type was discovered 15 years ago. Unlike ordinary dangerous objects, those beings would have the same body shape, intelligence and language as humans.\nCrucially, they had power different from humans.\n“Hmm”\nChun Yeowun nodded his head. He agreed with that part.\nIf it wasn’t for the weakness of thunder, the ability to pass through would be difficult to subdue.\nThe special type Gate had a very rare chance of bringing out an S-class. If it did, it was a catastrophe.\n“Cough... cough... the government and other agencies... because of their... intelligence... made several attempts to contact them, thinking they might be able to unlock the secrets of the Gate.”\nBut the results were a failure.\nThey viewed humans as nothing but subjects to control.\nLike a lion looking at its prey.\n‘But...’\nBut their bodies were made for battle.\nLike warlike.\nStill, this organization held that woman in custody.\n“What were you planning to do with the woman who didn’t even want to talk?”\n“Haaa... we... the organization... valued the power of a special entity... so... tried to... analyze it. Kuak!”\nResearcher Seo was having a hard time breathing.\nThere was a limit to the help Chun Yeowun’s energy could provide.\nChun Yeowun, who finished his questions about the woman, asked.\n“Tell me the name of your organization and the bases, fast!”\n“Haa... M... S... headquarters... ah..”\nHhh!\nAt that moment, heat surged through the researcher’s body.\n“Tch!”\nPak!\nChun yeowun tried to cool the body of the researcher, but.\nThud!\nThe man had stopped breathing.\nAgain, they were disposed of the moment they attempted to leak the information.\nBut he got one thing.\n“MS Group.”\nThe guy who died last time too, said something about the company name starting with an M.\nCoincidentally, Chun Yeowun now knew the name.\nThe name of the group which was engraved on the syringe of a nano bomb.\n‘It keeps connecting.’\nChun yeowun’s eyes narrowed.\nLooking back, the nano bomb was a higher level tech than the current world too.\nHe wasn’t sure what this organization was, but something was making Chun yeowun feel uncomfortable about it.\n‘Nano. Gather information about MS Group.’\n[Understood.]\nHaving gathered the clues, Chun yeowun’s interest turned to other things.\nIt was the special type entity.\nCrackle!\n“Kuak!”\nShe was still suffering.\nChun Yeowun approached her and thought.\n‘I don’t think this one can be tamed.’\nAlthough not human, the phasing ability was useful.\nAnd it looked like it could be useful in many ways if he could tame her, but the woman had harsh feelings towards humans.\n‘Should I just kill her?’\nIt was when he thought that.\nThe trembling woman got up.\n“Kuaak!”\n“Got used to it?”\nWhen Chun Yeowun raised his hand, the sword formed again.\nCrackle\nThis time, the lightning around it was much stronger.\nIf Chun Yeowun snapped his finger, the sword would pierce her head.\nIt was then.\nShe banged her head and shouted.\n“According to the clan law, Count Shakena will admit defeat! Everything will be given to the winner. Either take my life or make me a slave. I will do as you wish.”\n‘Oh?’\nUnexpectedly, a declaration of surrender was issued.\nIt didn’t seem like Chun Yeowun had to kill her.\n“You will obey me?”\n“Yes.”\nCrackle!\nAlthough she still had swords piercing her body, she answered politely.\nChun Yeowun asked.\n“In this clan, there seems to be a lot of beings like you. What are you?”\nHe was curious about this being.\nThe ‘special type entity’ was a title the people of earth gave them.\nShakena answered, shaking her head.\n“I don’t know what it is now, but the humans on earth who called us here, called our planet’s clans as demons.”\n“Demon?”\nMeanwhile, in Shenyang.\nThe bunker base of the Six Road Toys.\nThere, about twenty men in black masks were besieging the bunker, and two men were holding swords.\nClang!\nBut the fight didn’t last long.\n“Kyak!”\nClang!\nThe sword flew away and struck the ceiling.\nThe short-haired beauty was flustered. She was Huan Xia, the young lady of the Ghost Illusion clan.\nIn two seconds, the match was done.\nJjkkk!\nShe grabbed her bloody wrist and looked at her opponent’s sword.\nThe sword was much thinner and lighter than regular swords. It was the Crazy Blade.\nWheik!\nThinking the battle was over, the sword was put away.\nAnd with a disappointed face, he spoke to Huan Xia.\n“You haven’t honed your sword at all, despite being one of the 4 major ones. Your father was right in hiding you here.”\nAs he said that, Huan Xia’s nose flared.\n“Don’t insult my father. Right Guardian!”\nThe middle-aged man in a grey suit, called the Right Guardian, took off his sunglasses and smiled at her.\n“Right. By the way, where is this man who’s calling himself Chun Ma?”",

      "content": "“Demon?”\nChun yeowun looked puzzled.\nNano began to help.\n[Demons. A symbolic entity that appears in legends and fairy tales. It is an existence that means good and evil, and is opposed to an angel-like being. Sometimes in Christianity or Catholicism, it is called the devil, and in some other religions, it is called Youkai.]\nShhhh!\nChun Yeowun’s eyes trembled.\nInformation was being transferred into his head.\nThe demons known to people in general were the same as the devils in stories. It was said that they often stay in Devildom, Demon realm, or Hell as they deceive people and control their souls.\nWhat was more interesting was that Shakena said she came from a planet.\n‘Planet...’\nHumans of this age were desperate to block the Gate.\nSo, they didn’t care if there was another unknown world beyond the Gate.\nAnd the woman had just mentioned a planet.\n‘Nano. She is talking about the same kind of planet we live on?’\n[Right.]\nChun yeowun was always shocked by many things when he looked at the information that Nano sent him.\nBack in his time, he thought that the place was endless.\n‘There is another planet beyond the Gate?’\n[It cannot be said precisely.]\n‘Can’t it be found in your time too?’\nBeep!\n[System locked.]\nNano had several limitations.\nOne of them prevented it from divulging history.\nEven if the time axis changed, the lock was still on, and Chun Yeowun couldn’t do anything about it.\n‘I want to unlock it.’\nChun Yeowun wasn’t normally interested in such things, but after coming to the modern era, he ended up wondering about the time axis and history.\nCrackle!\n“Ugh!”\nEach time the lightning appeared, the woman’s body would tremble.\nChun Yeowun had taken out half the swords stuck in her body.\nShh!\n“Ah...”\nIt was to make her feel comfortable.\n“Woman.”\n“Yes?”\n“What is your purpose? Opening Gates to slaughter humans and subdue mankind? Why leave the place you live and come here?”\nChun Yeowun thought that these ones were the main culprits of the Gate.\nIt was because, unlike the other monsters which came through the Gate, they had intellectual abilities and strong fighting abilities.\nHowever, it was wrong.\nShe explained with a serious look.\n“The other Gates on earth aren’t ours.”\n“Then?”\n“Before we came, the earth was already open. If our clan wanted to conquer earth, we would’ve come as a group and not as individuals.\"\n‘Our clan’ meant there was a huge ranking system.\nAnd meant they were living in a civilized form.\nIf their purpose was to conquer, then leading an army was the best way.\n“Then why are you attacking humans?”\n“That... when the Gate opens, the humans are hostile towards us.”\n“Hostile?”\n“When I crossed the Gate, human armies attacked me.”\nHe knew.\nHumanity considered everything beyond the Gate dangerous.\nWhich meant there was no way to have a peaceful conversation.\nIf there was a chance for a conversation, humans would suppress the monster first and then talk.\n‘On top of that, this woman treats humans as insignificant creatures.’\nThe woman’s race was far more advanced than humans.\n“You mean you would have left us alone if you weren’t attacked?”\n“... I am not sure.”\n“Why?”\nShe answered carefully.\n“That is because the blood and meat of other races are good nutrients for our clan.”\n“Ha?”\nIn the end, the demons had no choice but to hurt the humans.\nIt was a race that considered humans as prey.\n“Our clan constantly fights and eats to grow stronger. The weak are our food.”\n“To grow strength through killing.”\nA completely different world from the one humans lived in.\nThe more such beings come, the more harmful mankind would be.\n“And do you eat your own weak ones too?”\n“No. hurting one’s own kin is prohibited by law. So the winner dominates the loser.”\nIt was said that the demons were smaller in number.\nNumerous races lived on the planet, and the total number of the demon population was less than 100,000.\nEven though the human population had decreased after the Gate opening, they were nowhere close to the 3.5 billion human population.\nTherefore, in order to preserve, they set up laws.\n“Fine. What is the real purpose of coming here? Anything else conquest?”\nHe wondered why they even crossed the Gate.\n“Came to find the traitor on the king’s order.”\n“Traitor? A revolt?”\n“We have no revolts.”\n“Must be loyal.”\n“Not that either. We only follow the strong. If anyone defeats the king, they will be the new king.”\nPower was law.\nAnd what made their clan particularly strong was self-esteem.\n“Good. So the king is the strongest.”\n“Thousands of Counts like me, cannot even touch the hair of the king.”\nAn amazing story.\nIn pure comparison, her strength was comparable to a Supreme Master.\nBut with the phasing ability, it would be hard to find a person who can handle her.\n“And your title is the standard one?”\n“Right. There are a thousand Counts like me, a hundred Marquis above us, ten Dukes and then three grand dukes under the king.”\n‘... amazing.’\nChun Yeowun was surprised.\nThere are 114 people stronger than her.\nIf they were to form a legion and attack, the present-day earth would perish.\n“Woman, what level are you among those who hold the Count title?”\n“3rd.”\n“3rd?”\n3rd out of one hundred was great. Perhaps the phasing ability was the reason.\nSuddenly, Chun Yeowun was curious about something.\n“What would my level be according to your standards?”\n“You are...”\nShe thought.\nIn her head, she compared him to the title-level demons. And then she said.\n“You will be in the top 10 Marquis.”\n“Marquis?”\nChun Yeowun’s eyebrows rose.\nHe didn’t show her his full power, but even then, he thought he would be Duke or higher, but she said Marquis?\n‘I am more curious about these ones now.’\nChun Yeowun has never met a worthy enemy other than Blade God.\nAnd he felt the need to grow after a long time.\n“Fun.”\nShakena was intrigued by Chun Yeowun.\n‘You might be higher than the Marquis level too.’\nThe person in front of her seemed more like a fellow than a human.\nAs a strong woman, she felt excited.\nChun Yeowun asked.\n“And if you catch the traitor, you won’t come through the Gate anymore?”\n“Unless the king orders it...”\nIf the king wanted to invade, they would come back.\nIt was troublesome.\nHowever, the fact that such a situation didn’t happen meant that the demons weren’t interested in humans.\n“Is the traitor a titled demon too?”\n“Yes.”\n“Which level?”\n“Baron level... but I am not sure what it is now.”\n“Why?”\n“Because he ate his own people.”\nAnger flashed in her eyes. It was the worst sin.\n‘That was why he was a traitor.’\nHe broke the law and ate his own people, so he deserved to be called a traitor.\nBut what did she mean when she said she couldn’t know his level since he ate his own people?\nShakena spoke to Chun Yeowun.\n“When a clan member is eaten, all the power is absorbed.”\n“Absorbing power?”\n“We build strength through predation. And it is more effective when done within the same clan for some races.”\nPredation of Kin meant 100% transfer.\nIt would be a huge temptation for demons who want to grow strong.\nThere was no other easy way to grow than eat one’s own kind.\n“Must be greedy.”\nThe clan seemed to know about it, but they banned it.\n‘Hmm.’\nIt was doubtful to say that eating one’s own kin was banned for the sake of population.\n“... A person who preyed on the kin can never resist temptation. We adore the strong, but we don’t acknowledge the strong who turned strong that way.”\nShe said that.\nIn any case, she was here to catch the traitor.\nIt was impossible to guess the traitor’s power as he had eaten a lot more since coming here.\n‘If not dealt with right away, the risk level will increase.’\nAs she said, he would keep getting stronger.\n“How to catch him if he is hiding?”\n“We can sense the aura of the same clan.”\nIt was like saying she could feel him.\nAnd if that one was dealt with, the demons will have no reason to come through the Gate anymore.\n“What are you going to do with me?”\nShakena asked without fear.\nChun Yeowun convinced her that he wouldn’t kill her and instead take her as a slave.\n“Well. I will hire you as my secretary.”\n“Secretary?”\nShakena didn’t know the word and looked puzzled.\nSo he explained.\n“Something like a slave.”\nAt that, her face brightened, and she shouted.\n“Shakena serves the Master!”\nAfter an SS-class Keeper, Chun yeowun had a Count level demon now.\nYongchun group’s conference room.\nThe atmosphere in the room was supposed to be bright. However, despite taking in the clans of Jinan under the cult, it was gloomy.\nThe reason was the message that director Huan Myung-oh got.\nAnd a picture of a man wearing sunglasses pulling out a sword in front of a bunker.\nCrush!\nThe handle on the chair was bent.\nIt was the last time that Huan Xia contacted him.\nThe phone couldn’t be called, and the signal couldn’t be traced.\n“Director Huan, calm down.”\nHang Yu-rin comforted him. At her words, he yelled out.\n“I don’t know where my daughter is. How can I calm down!”\nHe was cold-hearted when it came to other things, but he wasn’t always rational when it came to his adopted daughter.\nThe man couldn’t calm down.\nRight Guardian, Sub-hyung.\nThe best self-proclaimed thief.\nAnd a rival of Huan Myung-oh.\n“Ha... the right guardian must have joined them.”\nIt was a huge deal if one of the three guardians was selecting the Chun Yu-seong faction.\nAs far as they knew, Sub-hyung was focused on finding the secret prison where Lord Chun Woo-jin was kept.\nHuan Myung-oh got up from the seat and bowed to the chairman.\n“Chairman. This time, I need to go there. I don’t think this can be solved by just sending someone there.”\n“Calm down. If you aren’t careful about this, we might end up playing right into their hands...”\nShhh!\nAt that moment, someone came through the window. ‘\n“Ugh!”\nSuddenly, two people appeared through the window, and the people within the room stood up.\n“L-Lord Chun Ma.”\nIt was Chun Yeowun and Shakena, a naked woman with purple hair.\n“Ugh!”\nShocked at her being naked, the male executives all turned red in embarrassment.\n“It is truly a convenient ability.”\n“Thank you, master.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s praise, she nodded her head.\nShe couldn’t only phase herself, but also had the ability to phase objects she came in contact with.\n“Vice-chairman?”\nYu So-hwa rushed into the room and approached him.\nBeing his secretary, she had to take up the role of setting up the meeting on his behalf, since he suddenly flew away.\n“That woman?”\nChun Yeowun answered her.\n“Second secretary.”\n“Huh?”\nWhen asked why he brought in a naked woman, he said she was going to be the second secretary.\nShakena looked at the other woman.\nA weird gaze.\n“You! What are you doing?”\nShakena smiled at the displeased Yu So-hwa and said.\n“Human bitch. I like that outfit. Take it off.”",

      "content": "‘!?’\nWhen asked to take off her clothes, Yu So-hwa’s expression didn’t change. However, her face turned red in anger.\n“What are you talking about!”\n“Take off those clothes.”\nRather, it was the executives who were embarrassed with Shakena’s bold request.\n“Hmm.”\nEven if they were elderly, they were still men.\nAnd the situation was so weird.\nThe only person who could watch it without diverting her gaze was Hang Yu-rin.\n‘I don’t know who that woman is, but she must be a huge deal.’\nYu so-hwa was an SS-Class Keeper. And if she was a Murim warrior, she would be a Supreme Master.\nShakena looked over at Yu So-hwa’s clothes in a greedy way.\n“If you don’t want to, should I take it off for you?”\n‘!!!’\nIf a man had said that, it would have been a dangerous situation.\nThe woman approached Yu So-hwa, thinking she could do it.\n“You!! You need to know your place.”\nThe fingers of Yu So-hwa twitched.\nShe was ready to use gravity.\nDrrr!\nThe floor trembled, but Shakena smiled.\n“Hehe, looks like you don’t want to take it off.”\nAs a fighter, she had no reason to avoid a battle. Purple energy began to rise from her body.\nGoooo!\n‘This woman, isn’t she just plain crazy?’\nYu So-hwa narrowed her eyes. Since Chun yeowun brought her, she thought that the woman would be strong, but the woman just kept on ridiculing her.\nEveryone in the room was nervous.\n‘Who is she?’\n‘What is that energy...’\nAs she entered through the glass, they thought Shakena had special abilities, but the energy she was releasing was different.\n‘Where the hell did Lord Chun Ma find such a monster?’\nThey were all curious about her.\nOf course, more serious than that, the two women were going to fight each other till death.\nIt was then, Chun yeowun opened his mouth.\n“Enough.”\n“Sorry?”\n“Master?”\nBoth answered at the same time.\nAs soon as they heard him, the two women called back their energy.\n‘Sigh...’\nThe seniors looked curious at Chun Yeowun’s ability to control the two monstrous women at once.\nHandling an SS-Class keeper and a special type entity was like playing with two bombs.\n“Yu So-hwa, if you have extra clothes, lend them to Shakena.”\n“... yes sir.”\nShe agreed.\nHowever, Shakena mumbled while shyly twisting her body.\n“Master. I like the clothes that the human bitch is wearing...”\n“Are you going to try your luck despite being a slave?”\n“Ah, No!”\nPak!\nFlustered at Chun Yeowun’s cold words, Shakena knelt down and lowered her head.\nShe was aware of her position.\n“Shakena.\"\n“Yes.\"\n“She is the first secretary. So be mindful.”\n“Yes. However, if you give me the chance, I would like to covet the title. Please allow it.”\n“Slave?”\nYu So-hwa was confused.\nShe couldn’t understand to which era this woman belonged.\nMoreover, despite bowing to Chun Yeowun, the naked woman kept glaring at her.\nGrab!\nChun Yeowun grabbed her on the shoulder.\nAnd she groaned at the pain which hit her brain.\nCrackle!\n“Ackk!”\n“I told you not to cross the line.”\n“I-I apologize!”\nShakena had a different way of thinking from humans.\nTherefore, Chun Yeowun was being more strict towards her.\n“Treat her like you treat an elder.”\n“Yes.”\n‘Ahh.’\nDespite not understanding the situation, Yu So-hwa felt grateful when Chun Yeowun treated her in a special way.\nWhen Chun Yeowun took his hand off her, Shakena bowed to Yu So-hwa.\n“I apologize.”\nAs if to let her know that she didn’t like it, she looked at Yu So-hwa with a bitter look.\nAnd silence fell again.\nYu So-hwa smiled and then looked at the woman’s breast and said.\n“My clothes will be baggy to you, but they might fit.”\n‘!?’\nShakena didn’t understand what she meant.\nHowever, when she left the conference room to get clothes, her face distorted as she looked at Yu So-hwa’s voluptuous breasts.\n‘Human!’\nRegardless of race, they were both women.\nAnd now they were secretaries.\nChun Yu-jang approached Chun yeowun once the two left and reported.\n“Lord. There is a problem.”\n“Problem?”\n“Director Huan.”\nHuan Myung-oh approached Chun Yeowun with a dark face, then showed him the phone and said.\n“Lord Chun Ma. My daughter has been caught.”\n“Caught?”\nIf it was Huan Xia, then she was supposed to be hiding with Baek Jong-so and his mother in the Six Road Toys bunker.\nPuzzled, Chun Yeowun looked at the photo on the phone.\nThe moment he saw the picture, Chun Yeowun said.\n“Crazy Blade.”\nThere was no way Chun Yeowun didn’t know about the sword.\nIt was his first teacher’s, Right Guardian Sub-meng’s sword.\nThe fact that this person was holding it could only mean one thing.\n“Right guardian?”\n“Yes. It seems like the Right Guardian has joined the Chun Yu-seong’s faction.”\nIt was weird. The Guardians only serve the Lord.\nIf one of the Guardians, Sub-hyung, joined the Chun Yu-seong faction, then it couldn’t be ruled out that the other Guardians did so too.\nThis could be trouble for Chun Yu-jang, as it meant that the Guardian found the secret prison where the Lord was being kept with the help of another faction.\n‘I can’t tell this to Chun Ma. Ugh...’\nHe wasn’t sure what could happen.\nHe knew that Chun Yeowun was very strict when it came to putting someone as the Lord.\nThud!\nAt that time, Huan Myung-oh knelt down and begged.\n“Lord Chun Ma. Please save my daughter!”\n“Director Huan!”\nChun Yu-jang panicked.\nIt was understandable that he was impatient and unable to contact his daughter. However, Chun Yeowun was Chun Ma, and he couldn’t ask someone like him to do such tasks.\nEven he, who shared the same blood, would only allow himself to receive orders and never request anything.\n“I am sorry, chairman.”\nBut Huan Myung-oh couldn’t back down.\n‘Only Chun Ma can free my daughter.’\nIt had been over 40 minutes since he got her message. Even if the Right Guardian took them away, they couldn’t have left the city yet.\nIt was their only chance to catch them.\n“I want to go and rescue my daughter myself, but it will take two days for me to get to Shenyang.”\nIf he had wings, he would have left right away.\nAnd since he didn’t, Chun Yeowun was his only hope.\n“Please! Please!”\nThud!\nHuan Myung-oh banged his head.\nWhoo!\nHe kept hitting it till he was stopped.\n‘Ah!’\nAs he raised his head, hoping for a positive answer, Chun Yeowun said.\n“Be quiet.”\n“Y-yes.”\n“Tell me.”\n“Huh?”\n“Not you.”\nHuan Myung-oh was confused.\nHe had already told him everything.\nChun Yeowun’s eyes were moving, he had opened up augmented reality.\n[Calling Lee Myeong.]\nHe was talking on the phone.\nThe call was done through the phone of Yu Mun-pyeong, the director of Six Road Toys.\nNano had hacked the receiving chip and taken the code. Thanks to that, Chun Yeowun was able to make calls without the phone.\nIn his ears, he could hear the voice of Lee Myeong.\n— Cough cough... I’m chasing them right now.\nOn an overpass in Shenyang City.\nInside the white RV which was driving down, Lee Myeong was holding the steering wheel with blood-dried hands.\nHis top was stained red with blood, and he didn’t seem to be in good condition.\nEven when he looked like he was on the verge of dying, he wasn’t letting go of the wheel.\n— What happened?\nChun Yeowun’s voice came through the Bluetooth speaker.\nLee Myong looked at the 12 seater grey van, which was 30 meters ahead.\n“Ahha... haaa.. unknown people attacked us.”\n— Was there anyone who wore sunglasses among them?\nLee Myeong was shocked at that question.\n“Yes. How did you know?”\n— Huan Xia sent a message to her father.\n“I see. Cough.”\n— You don’t seem to be in a good state.\n“I got hit by a guy.”\nGrunt!\nAs he said that, Lee Myeong grunted.\nHe was out shopping with Baek Jong-so. When they returned, they found out that they had been attacked.\nThe people were already done with their work and were leaving. That’s when they met and were hit by them.\nBaek Jong-so’s team member was hit and died right away, while Moyong Lee Myeong was hit in the stomach.\nHe still remembered what he was told.\n[I see you are a normal civilian. Consider yourself lucky to have come this far. If you are fortunate enough to survive this, forget about everything that has happened here.]\nWith those words, the man took Huan Xia and Baek Jong-so’s mother and left in a van.\nHowever, something happened.\n‘Was it luck?’\nWhen ordinary people are hit with internal energy, their organs rupture and turn unable to move.\nAfter coughing up blood several times, Lee Myeong was able to move.\nHe himself was shocked. But he decided not to waste time thinking about it.\nHe immediately got into his RV and started chasing them.\n“For now, I am trying to catch up, but if they get past Shenyang, I won’t be able to do anything.”\nThat was his concern.\nThe car was moving southwest towards the high-speed underground train.\n— Keep the call going.\n“Huh?”\nLee Myeong couldn’t understand it at all.\nHowever, he had no chance but to do as told.\nMeanwhile, inside the grey Benz going ahead.\nBaek Jong-so was unable to move due to his blood points being sealed, but he was glaring at Sub-hyung.\n“You are making a huge mistake. Right Guardian.”\nAt his words, Sub-hyung didn’t seem fazed and said.\n“Before I hit you more, I expect you to stay silent, Pure Kick clan’s kid.”\n“Try doing that!”\nThe reason Baek Jong-so was angry was simple.\nIt was because he was hit by the Right Guardian, whom he trusted.\nNext to Sub-hyun sat a large man.\n“You will surely pay for kidnapping my mother and me! Believe this.”\n“Understand this. We have a duty to protect the last purebred descendant.”\n“You call this protection?”\nIn the back seat, Geum Oh-yeon and Huan Xia had passed out.\nIt was kidnapping, no matter how you look at it.\n“Lord Chun Ma won’t forgive you!”\n“Ha!”\nAt Baek Jong-so’s word, the Right Guardian snorted.\nAnd then he suddenly pressed Baek Jong-so’s chest as he spoke in a daunting voice.\n“You and I can be Chun ma too, but this so-called purebred couldn’t even save his own ass. Do you even have a chance to succeed in following your father’s footsteps?”\n“I see that you are ignoring the truth?”\n“Truth? How funny! Do you think that we’ll believe in the nonsense that the 24th Lord from a thousand years ago is still alive? Chun Ma will come? Hahaha!”\n“Those words... you’ll regret it...”\nBaek jong-so warned, but Sub-hyung smiled.\n“You will regret it.”\n— Right Guardian.\nHearing a voice in his ear, Sub-hyung stopped his words. It was the voice of the driver in the second car.\nHe touched the earphone and said.\n“What is it?”\n— Someone is following.\n“Following? Who is it?”\n— Looking in the mirror, it seems like he is that guy who was left in front of the bunker.\n“What?”\nSub-hyun frowned.\nHe was sure that he had left the man on the verge of death.\nHowever, such an ordinary human seemed unshaken and was following them?\n‘He definitely wasn’t a warrior.’\nIt was questionable. However, since the guy was identified, he could just check it later.\nHe pulled down the van’s curtain and looked.\n“Can you lure the vehicle to a visible place?”\n— Alright. I will lure him.\nThe driver of the 2nd car turned away.\nThe road leading to the high-speed train was densely blocked.\nBut since they were driving for 20 minutes now and were getting closer to the wall, the vehicles on the road began to decrease.\nAt that point, there were two vans and one RV behind them.\n“Damn it.”\nMoyong Lee Myeong, who was tracking them, groaned.\nSince he fell outside the usual road, something felt strange, and his prediction was correct.\nThey noticed that he was tailing them.\n‘What should I do?’\nFor his safety, it was right to give up on tailing them.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun said that he had to keep following them.\nIt was when he was in thought.\nKiiik!\nThe van slowed down, and he got stuck behind the slow car.\nLee Myeon tried to move to the left lane and speed up, but another van came to the next side.\n“Damn! I’ll be hit.”\nHe couldn’t move anywhere as he was being sandwiched.\nAnd then the car and the van moved ahead, putting Lee Myeong in the middle.\nThe driver of the 2nd car smiled.\n“Caught you!”\nHe stepped on the accelerator to hit the RV.\nIt was then.\nThuds!\n“Ugh!”\nSomething fell in front of the van.\n“A man?”\nShocked, the driver in the 2nd van tried to drive away, but then the man who landed raised his hand towards the van, and.\nWoong!\nThe front of the van was lifted up.\n“W-what the hell!”\nShocked, he ended up pressing on the accelerator and then the brake. As a result, the van turned over.\nEukkk!\nHearing the screams through the earphone, Sub-hyun, who was in the van ahead, shouted.\n“Car 2... what is going on?”\nBaek Jong-so, who was sitting opposite to him, licked his lips and said.\n“Didn’t I say that you were going to regret it?”\n“What nonsense are you uttering now...”\nBang!\nA huge shock with a loud roar.\nThe van ended up stopping right away.\nKiiik!\nIn an instant, everything turned into a mess.\nNo one knew what was happening.\nWhen they looked at the ceiling, they saw footprints engraved on it.\n“Footprints?”\nBrrr!\nIt was then.\nThe ceiling tore open like a piece of paper.\nSomeone was looking down on them.\n‘W-what is this?’\nA young man with a sharp face and pure white eyes.\nKo Wang-hyeon and Sub-hyung were confused until Baek Jong-so exclaimed loudly.\n“Baek jong-so of the Pure Kick Clan greets Lord Chun Ma!”",

      "content": "The expression of Ko Wang-hyeon and Sub-hyung stiffened at the word of Chun Ma.\nIt was the existence that Baek Jong-so kept talking about.\n‘Chun Ma? Him?’\nAs it happened suddenly, Sub-hyung couldn’t respond right away, but then he pulled out his sword.\nShh!\nHe immediately jumped at Chun Yeowun, who was standing on the ceiling of the van.\nHis thin blade of light fluttered like a butterfly.\nShhh!\nHe used the technique of subjugating the opponent with a series of agile and successive techniques.\nThe most effective ones too.\n‘To suppress him at once.’\nThe opponent seemed strong since he could stop a moving van, which meant that Sub-hyung had to rely on speed.\nIt was then.\nPak!\n“Huk?”\nSub-hyung was shocked.\nA strange thing happened before his blade could even fully unfold.\n‘No way...’\nHis blade was blocked by Chun Yeowun’s finger.\nInstead of cutting down the finger, the sword was trembling, unable to move.\n‘I need to pull it out.’\nHe tried to retrieve his blade.\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun grabbed the blade at lightning speed and pulled it away.\nWheik!\n“Crazy Blade. It has been a while since I held this.”\nChun Yeowun looked down at the sword he caught with a smile.\nConsidering that this era was a thousand years later, a lot of time must have passed, but the blade was well maintained despite a bit of fading in color.\n“Give me my blade!”\nThe biggest shame for a warrior was to lose their weapon.\nIt was an insult.\nSub-hyung tried to take back his blade.\nWoong!\nSub-hyun moved and aimed for Chun yeowun’s wrist, but before he could even attack, the Crazy Blade was aimed at his neck.\nKiak!\n“Huh?”\nThe energy around the Crazy Blade said that it was ready to cut down its own master. Sub-hyung was scared.\nEverything happened in front of him, but he couldn’t really understand it.\n“Slow! Your swordsmanship needs to be faster.”\n“H-how?”\n“What do you mean how? Like this.”\nShhh!\nThe Crazy Blade in Chun yeowun’s hand started to cause afterimages while moving like a butterfly.\nBehind the sunglasses, Sub-hyung’s eyes were wide.\n‘T-this!’\n“However, you still need to pay.”\n“Pay?”\nAt that moment, the shaking Crazy Blade brushed Sub-hyung’s wrist.\nClash!\nA red line appeared on the wrist.\nTak!\nThe wrist, which was cut, fell into the van.\nThe members of the Cult inside the van were shocked.\n“Ahhh! My! My hand!”\nThe Right Guardian, whose wrist was severed, screamed.\n“How dare you!”\nKo Wang-hyeon, who watched that, raised his huge body with an angry face and blew like a cannon towards the van’s ceiling.\nChachachacha!\nAny remaining part of the ceiling was shattered.\nBut.\n‘It didn’t reach him.’\nKo Wang-hyun frowned.\nHe thought that the young man would have definitely been hit, but only the ceiling broke.\nHe could see that Chun Yeowun was still floating.\n“Think you can avoid this!”\nPhat!\nThe entire van shook as he jumped up.\nKo Wang-hyeon jumped into the air and unleashed 3 Second Strike against Chun yeowun.\nPapapak!\nIt concentrated on successive hits to take down the opponent at once.\nAnd the power was strong enough to break down a rock of over 5 meters high.\n“You can’t avoid this!”\nHe aimed for a time when the opponent would have a hard time moving.\nHowever, his opponent was Chun Yeowun.\n“You must be the descendant of Ko Wanghur. You have the same body size too.”\n“What?”\nPak!\n“Ugh?”\nChun Yeowun held his fist.\n“Fi-fist energy with bare hands?”\nThe energy used on his fists was the strongest, but the attacked hand was fine, and the one which attacked was trembling.\n“A soft fist.”\n“What?”\nGrab!\nChun yeowun clenched the fist harder.\nConfused, Ko Wang-hyeon tried to pull out, but.\nCrack!\n“Kuaaak!”\nThe bones were crushed.\nChun Yeowun threw Ko Wang-hyeon into the middle of the road.\nSwish! Thud!\nHis body flew down and rolled a couple of times.\nWhen his body stopped, he tried to get up, only to cough up a handful of blood.\n“Cough!”\nDespite using his full power, the opponent didn’t seem bothered at all.\n‘What strength!’\nThe Right guardian and himself, who were in the top ten inside the Sky Demon order, were quickly subdued.\nThis man’s strength was beyond their imagination.\n‘Descendant of Ko Wanghur?’\nA name he heard a lot.\nIt was then.\n“Protect mr. Ko!”\nClang!\nThe members of the Cult pulled down their swords and came out of the crushed-down vans.\nA member who seemed like the leader shouted.\n“Sword Demon formation!”\n20 warriors, 12 of which were at Master level, formed a circle around Chun Yeowun.\nChak!\n“Sword Demon Formation...”\nChun yeowun’s eyes narrowed.\nSword Demon Formation.\nIt was something created by the Sword Demon.\nThis was something that was created to deal with 101 warriors.\nAnd the examinations were all conducted to measure its efficiency.\nAll the members of the Cult were familiar with it.\nAs the number of warriors increased from 12, to 36 to 108, their power would increase, and they would even be able to handle Supreme Master warriors.\n“Haa...”\nThe warriors were all terrified.\nThey had just witnessed the defeat of two of the strongest people in their Cult, so they knew that Chun Yeowun was a great warrior.\nBut they couldn’t back down.\nSo the leader shouted.\n“Sword Three Arrey formation!”\nThe members who spread out in a circle at the same time tried to unfold the swordsmanship towards Chun Yeowun.\nChun Yeowun shook his head and.\n“Kneel...”\nIt was then.\n“Stop!”\nKo Wang-hyeon jumped into the middle.\n“Huh? Manager Ko!”\n“Stop everyone!”\nAll the members were shocked at his sudden intervention.\nKo Wang-hyeon asked in a cautious voice.\n“Can I ask one question?”\nChun Yeowun didn’t say anything.\nHe politely raised his hand and then asked.\nGrab!\n“How do you know the name Ko Wanghur?”\nKo Wanghul was the 17th head of the Demon Fist Clan.\nIt was known to be a high-ranking clan. The clan was reborn when he became one of the Six Swords of the 24th Lord Chun Yeowun, the Demon God.\nHowever, it was impossible for anyone other than the said clan to remember such an old name.\nChun Yeowun answered him.\n“He was the first of the Six Swords. He must be your ancestor, right?”\n‘Six Swords!’\nNo other title.\nHowever, for the members of the Demon Fist Clan, it was a lifetime honor.\nHearing that, Ko Wang-hyeon’s body trembled.\n‘Is it true?’\nWhen Baek Jong-so was talking about it, he was skeptical.\nDue to the recent video of the Chun Woo-kyung faction, they were all sensitive to the title of Chun Ma.\n“P-please show this lowly member of the Cult some proof, Lord Chun Ma.”\n“Tch, you only change depending on what you see.”\nChun yeowun clicked his tongue.\nBut it wasn’t like he couldn’t understand it, so he held out his right arm and.\nChachacha!\nA black wrist guard suddenly appeared and turned into a sword.\nThe black sword which shone displayed the name Sky Demon Sword.\n‘Sky Demon Sword! The real Sky Demon Sword!’\nHe was the descendant of Ko Wanghur, one of the Six Swords.\nSo Ko Wang-hyeon knew that the Sky Demon Sword wasn’t just a sword.\nWhen he saw it, he cried out.\n“What are you all doing! Bow down!”\nPak!\nThe Cult members knelt down once the order fell.\nKo Wang-hyeon, who was the first, shouted.\n“The lowly members of the Cult greet the great Sky Demon order’s Demon God!”\n“Lord Chun Ma!”\nRight guardian, Sub-hyung, who was holding his severed wrist, couldn’t shut his mouth.\n‘Is that reall...’\nHe didn’t believe the words till the end.\nWith trembling eyes, he looked at Baek jong-so. The man was sitting in the van smiling.\nAnd then he remembered what he said a while back.\n[Truth? How funny! Do you think that we’ll believe in the nonsense that the 24th Lord from a thousand years ago is still alive? Chun Ma will come? Hahaha!]\nAnd he laughed proudly.\nHe also killed Baek Jong-so’s colleagues and kidnapped his mother, and even Huan Xia.\nTurning white, Right Guardian mumbled.\n“What have I done...”\nOn the eastern side of Baoding City.\nInside a tall building.\nThe group’s name was written on the wall.\nThe room of the president in the Chunshin building.\nA middle-aged man with a mustache answered the phone with a serious face and looked out of the window.\n“Yeah. I see.”\nThe middle-aged man hung up the phone, and someone asked.\n“Presid-no, chairman, is something wrong?”\n“No, everything is fine.”\nThe middle-aged man with a mustache was the chairman. He turned his head towards the sofa and smiled as he went to take a seat.\nOn the other side, sat a man with short hair and a tall appearance. He wore a mask that had a strange pattern on it.\n“I apologize to the guest.”\n“Not at all.”\n“I am glad to be able to do this with two Guardians.”\n“This is for the unity of the Cult.”\nThe masked man answered.\nThe chairman, who looked at him, asked.\n“Great Guardian, the date of the ceremony, I think that it needs to be pushed closer.”\n“What do you mean?”\nThe chairman smiled and said.\n“It seems like a precious guest will come to notarize the ceremony on behalf of my father in prison.”\n/strong>",

      "content": "Sub-hyung and Ko Wang-hyeon, who were trying to escape after kidnapping Baek Jong-so, Geum Oh-yeon and Huan Xia, had no choice but to delay their departure because it was urgent for them to treat their injuries.\nLate in the afternoon.\nIn front of the Six Road Toys’ bunker.\nWheik!\nBranches soaked in oil burned.\nThe dead bodies wrapped up in cloth were set on fire.\nTak!\nBaek Jong-so was standing close to the blazing fire with a bitter expression.\n‘Sorry.’\nWhatever it was, these were the people that he spent time and had meals with.\nTurning into close friends, he couldn’t help but feel that they had died because of him.\n‘All this happened because I am weak.’\nThe supposed clan leader of one of the highest clans in the Cult was still a Super Master Level warrior.\nIt’s true that he wasn’t taught and that he didn’t have any teacher. However, he couldn’t deny the truth that people were dying because of his helplessness.\nGrunt!\nHe felt embarrassed about it.\nBaek Jong-so pulled out a paper from his pocket.\nChun Yeowun gave it to him.\n[This is what you need the most right now.]\nReading what was written in it, Baek Jong-so was shocked.\n[Pure Heart Method.]\nIt was a technique of the Pure Kick Clan.\nBaek Jong-so had learned the basics of this method when he was still with his father, the former clan leader.\nBut once his father left them, he ended up trying to use other methods to use this technique.\n‘Ahh! Lord Chun Ma!’\nChun Yeowun understood his feelings.\nIf one knew of the Pure Heart method, one’s cultivation and martial arts were bound to have an exemplary boost.\nIt was written down on 2 sheets of paper, and on the back was energy cultivation.\n[Burn this after memorizing it.]\nAll the instructions were given.\n“HuanYuan (heaven and Earth) Cultivation Method?”\nAs he read what was written below it, his expression changed.\nSure, the clan method for internal energy cultivation was very good, but this one, the HuanYuan cultivation, looked very effective.\n‘What is this method?’\nIt was a method that Nano had created after analyzing all the multiple methods used in the Sky Demon Order, when Chun Yeowun was in the academy.\nBaek Jong-so couldn’t take his eyes off it.\n‘The cycle of energy through the center... Becoming one with HuanYuan...’\nThud!\nBaek Jong-so immediately sat on the ground and took the stance of meditation.\nThere was no such thing as having a guide to help him through this, yet it had to be done, especially now that he knew what he had to do.\nSomeone was watching it unfold from inside the bunker.\n‘I guess he isn’t dumb.’\nIt was Chun Yeowun.\nChun Yeowun had given him a slightly improved method.\nBased on the realization that the current age lacked the needed energy, he relied on Nano to make the necessary changes.\n‘Adjustment to an appropriate level.’\nThis method was for the present and the future.\nIf a strong warrior looked at this method, he might die of shock.\nChun Yeowun had given him a treasure that no one knew about.\nWheik!\nBaek Jong-so, who memorized it, threw the crumpled up paper into the fire.\nIt must be because he himself had realized that this method shouldn’t fall into others’ hands.\n‘I need to make sure the others evolve as well.’\nFrom Chun Yeowun’s point of view, the current Cult lacked dedication.\nIt was disorganized and pathetic.\nWhen Chun Yeowun was the Lord, the whole Cult was known to be strong, not just the Lord.\nChak!\nChun Yeowun turned back and closed the curtains.\nBehind him was a man who was sweating.\nIt was Lee Myeong.\n“Uhhh.”\nA groan escaped from his mouth.\nHe was in so much pain that the veins on his forehead were standing up.\n“Cough...”\nAs he coughed, blood dripped from the corner of his lips.\nIn a dying voice, Lee Myeong asked.\n“W-why should I use a cultivation method? I am not able to do it in the first place!”\nWhat he was currently performing was the Dance of the Mind. It was something he had learned as a child, and he still remembered it.\nThe problem was.\n‘It feels like all my blood vessels are torn!’\nThere was no choice but to go through the technique despite the absence of internal energy.\nSuddenly one day, his body became unable to hold internal energy. And no one knew the cause of it.\n“Ouch!”\nHe was trying to do the technique as Chun Yeowun told him to, but the more he tried, the more it seemed like he was going to die.\nDeciding that he couldn’t, he tried to stop.\nTak!\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun touched his Dantian.\n“Ah?”\n“Shut your mouth and keep doing it.”\nHe was pushing internal energy into him.\nLee Myeong was already trying to use the method without having any internal energy, and when energy was being pushed in from outside, the pain was much more horrible.\n“Kuaaak!”\nLee Myeong ended up screaming.\nHe was the man who was called a coward, so he tried struggling with pain, but it seemed like luck wasn’t on his side.\nChun Yeowun put the other hand on his head.\n[Start scanning.]\nRed light flashed from his palm, and the scan began.\nChun Yeowun continued to scan the body while injecting energy.\nIn his augmented reality, Lee Myeong’s blood vessels were being scanned.\n‘I see.’\nChun Yeowun nodded his head.\nAs he expected, there were blocks in the vessels.\n‘They made it impossible for him to learn.’\nThe blood vessels of Lee Myeong, which normally would pass the energy, were blocked.\nBecause of that, he couldn’t build any internal energy within him.\nIf it was solved, then Lee Myeong could start training internal energy in his body again.\nBut there was one problem.\n‘Is it here?’\nChun Yeowun looked at the chest.\nAs he continued to infuse internal energy, heat was rising in the side of the chest.\nThere was extreme Yang.\n‘This is interesting.’\nChun Yeowun smiled.\n“Solar Yang Fever.”\nLee Myeong’s body was born with Yang Fever which meant he produced too much Yang energy.\nIt was the opposite to the Yin Fever from which endless Yin energy was produced.\nAnd if things had gone wrong, Lee Myeong could have died when he was 18.\n“It has to be fate for you to meet me.”\n“Kuak. What are you...”\n“There is only one thing which can control the Yang Fever.”\nTak! Tak!\n“Kuak!”\n“Shut up, or you might actually die.”\n“Hmm!”\nTataktak!\nChun Yeowun’s fingers touched all the blood vessels.\nIt wasn’t the simple sealing, but it was to forcibly release the restricted part.\nLee Myeong’s blood vessels all had bulged out.\nGoo!\nAs the restrictions on his body were lifted, the extreme yang energy in his body surged all through the body.\nHis whole body turned as hot as a gas stove.\n‘Good. All that is left is.’\nPak!\n“Kuak!”\nChun Yeowun placed his palm on the upper part of the Dantia and started to release Yin energy into him.\nThe temperature within the bunker dropped.\nJkkk!\nFrost began to form on the wall.\nIt was as if the room had turned into the North Pole.\nShhhhh!\n“Uh-huh!”\nMist was released from Lee Myeong’s body, since he was burning seconds ago.\nDespite having extreme Yang in him, his body was giving out.\nHis energy couldn’t stand against Chun Yeowun, who possessed both yin and Yang in him.\n“What the hell!”\nManager Ko Wang-hyeon, who was receiving treatment in the hospital, looked at the frozen bunker when he came back.\nThe outer part of the bunker was frozen white, it was as if cold energy was released from inside.\n“It has been like that for 3 hours now.”\nBaek Jong-so informed him.\nHe had been watching the sudden event too.\nSuddenly, Ko Wang-hyeon asked Baek Jong-so.\n“But you...”\n“Me?”\n“Something has changed.”\nThe energy coming from Baek Jong-so looked stable.\nIt was safe to say that Baek Jong-so was at the end of Super Master level.\n‘Did something happen?’\nThis would have been impossible to happen in such a short time.\nAnd it wasn’t just Ko Wang-hyeon who noticed it.\n‘What is that? Did his martial skills suddenly increase?’\nRight guardian was shocked too. There was no way anyone could refine their Dantian and show such remarkable growth in such a short time.\n“Did Lord Chun Ma by any chance give...”\nIt was then.\nKwang!\nThe door of the frozen bunker broke open, making everyone look at it.\nJjkkk!\nAnd someone appeared.\n‘Who?’\nShhh\nThe person, whose body was releasing white steam, suddenly moved towards the Right Guardian.\nPhat!\nIt was fast.\nIn an instant, the person reached the Right guardian.\nThe shocking thing was, it was Lee Myeong.\n“What is with him?”\nThe Right Guardian could not use his right hand as he had just had a surgery on it.\n“Shit!”\nAlthough he wasn’t used to the left hand, he was at Superior Master level.\nSo he pushed his left hand ahead and decided to hit Lee Myeong in the heart.\nPak!\nRather, his arm bounced back.\n“Huh?”\nIt was frustrating.\nObviously, this man had nothing to do with martial arts. But it was the Right Guardian’s fist that bounced back.\nTatak!\nRight Guardian Sub-hyun immediately spread open the distance to avoid getting hit. However, Lee Myeong was able to follow him.\n‘Is he using footwork?’\nLee Myeong was chasing him by unfolding the footwork.\nAnger flashed in Sub-hyung’s eyes.\n“Are you really trying to get me mad?”\nSub-hyung raised his left hand.\nThe Crazy Blade, which reacted to his energy, was pulled into his hand.\nWoong!\nAnd with that, he began to unfold the technique.\nHe quickly moved his body and unfolded the Butterfly Blade Dance.\nAt that, Lee Myeong’s fists crossed, and a red light flashed.\n‘This?’\nThe energy seemed to be different, seeing how the color it displayed was red.\n‘What the hell is he?’\nJust a few hours back, this man couldn’t even do any martial arts.\nBut now suddenly, he was able to stand against a Superior Master level.\nPapak!\nLee Myeong extended his fist.\nIt was the 4th form of Yeon’s United Dance of Fist, a technique of the Moyong clan.\nChachacha!\nThe sound of waves crashing resounded all over the place.\nThe sophistication of the technique was superior to Sub-hyung’s.\nHowever, because the Yang energy was so strong, whenever the blade touched Lee Myeong’s energy, it would turn red in heat.\n‘Then!’\nSub-hyung opened the distance and aimed for the head.\nClash!\nThe sword caused afterimages and drew semi-circles.\nLee Myeong had no choice but to move back.\n‘Avoided this?’\nSub-hyun frowned.\nLee Myeong had definitely avoided this attack on his own accord.\nShhh!\nLee Myeong smiled.\nIt had been a long time since he felt this good.\n‘I am able to deal with a warrior like him?’\nHe was shocked at himself.\nHe hadn’t used martial arts for nearly 15 years, but strangely, his body seemed free. His body was moving the same way he wanted it to.\nThe power of the body used to the Solar Yang Fever.\nAnd with all the energy now opened inside his body, he felt like he could reach the state of Superior Master level and be on the same level as the strong Murim warriors.\nWhen he was unable to use martial arts, the Right Guardian had hurt him.\nAnd now, he was taking his revenge.\n“Try again.”\nWith confidence, he provoked Sub-hyung.\n“You really are!”\nHe took off the glasses and threw them to the floor. He decided that the opponent didn’t have to be dealt with in moderation anymore.\nThe moment they both were about to attack each other.\n“Enough”\nChun Yeowun appeared between them and ordered.\n“Lord Chun Ma.”\nShocked, Sub-hyung sheathed his blade and knelt on one knee.\nChun Yeowun looked at Lee Myeong, whose hands were dyed in red.\n“You have given out enough energy, now go and cultivate it.”\nChun Yeowun was the one who told him to go out and release his energy.\nAlthough Lee Myeong was healed, his body was still overflowing with Yang energy.\nIt seemed like releasing it outside was the right way to decrease the built-up energy.\n“I feel like I need to release it a bit more.”\nHowever, despite Chun Yeowun’s words, Lee Myeong wanted to move more.\nHis body was finally free after being shackled for half his life. There was no way he could hold back the angry emotions which he was holding back till then.\n“I said you did enough.”\n“Lord. If it is with you, I might be able to draw out even more.”\nGoo!\nWith those words, Lee Myeong’s body began to release intense energy.\nA red aura came out like a haze.\nSizzle!\nDespite it being a chilly winter day, the entire area turned hot.\n‘Didn’t he use all his energy against me?’\nSub-hyung was shocked.\nA human body radiating such extreme yang energy.\n‘Solay Yang Fever!’\nThat was when he understood.\nWhy the bunker froze!\n‘Did the Lord cure him?’\nThen that would explain the sudden growth in the ability.\nIt was said that such a body would appear once a hundred years, yet those possessing it would be short-lived as such bodies were a curse to martial arts users.\nHowever, if one was lucky enough to live, then they would be the strongest warrior!\n“I am coming!”\nLee Myeong rushed to Chun Yeowun.\nPhat!\nBefore one could notice, he was right in front of Chun yeowun.\nWith that energy, he thought he would be able to deal with Chun Yeowun to some extent before getting defeated.\n“You could do nothing a second back.”\n‘Huh?’\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun reached for the forehead and then flicked his finger.\n‘Flick to the forehead?’\nThe moment the finger flicked and touched his forehead.\nBam! Psss!\n“kuak!”\nBlood gushed out from the bruised forehead.\nWith unbearable pain, Lee Myeong bounced back and broke past the outer wall of the bunker.\nThud!\nMoyong Lee Myeong, who was thrown out, mumbled at the ridiculous strength.\n“Mon... ster.... Ugh!”\nAnd passed out.",

      "content": "Shenyang Station, early in the morning.\n30 years ago, the trains and the underground subways weren’t that greatly used.\nWhen the Gates began to open, the cities ended up being closed off by walls.\nTherefore, the concept of trains changed. T\nThe trains worked underground.\nOne would think that the station was below ground, but no, it was above ground.\nAnd one had to purchase a ticket to enter the basement platform.\n‘Everything of this era is great.’\nChun Yeowun couldn’t help but admire the underground platform.\nEven if Nano was helping him through the knowledge of the era, seeing it in person was a different feeling.\n‘So fun.’\nEverything was different from the time he was from.\nEverything felt new and different, like he was on a tour.\nUnlike Chun Yeowun, Ko Wang-hyeon and Sub-hyung were looking down.\n‘The purebred is out.’\nBaek Jong-so, his mother and Huan Xia. They did come to the station, but they took a different platform.\nThey were en route to Jinan city.\n‘The Chairman will be disappointed.’\nAmong the high clans of the Cult, the Pure Kick clan had a huge name.\nAll factions were aiming to bring the mother and the only descendant of the Pure Kick clan.\nHowever, the Pure Kick clan had never chosen a faction to side with.\n‘Chun Ma.’\nWho would have thought that he would appear?\nHe meant a lot more than the clans.\nIt was because Chun Yeowun meant the Sky Demon order itself.\n‘The chairman asked to bring him.’\nChairman Chun Yu-seong, who received the report from Ko Wang-hyeon, didn’t harbor any doubt.\nRather, he gave instructions to bring Chun Ma as respectfully as possible.\n‘If Chun Ma sides with the chairman!’\nThen the long battle would end.\nIf that could happen, then the Cult would be reborn.\nKo Wang-hyeon avoided the gaze of Chun Yeowun, who was looking around and sent a message through his phone.\n[We are starting now.]\nAt the same time.\nInside a Building of the Chunshin Group, southeast of Baoding city.\nSeveral officials were gathered in the chairman’s office on the top floor of the building.\nHrrr!\nSitting on the right, a middle-aged man with a sad look, grey hair and a blue shirt, looked at the vibrating screen.\n“Chairman. Manager Ko Wang-hyeon reported.”\nAt the report, the mustached middle-aged man sitting at the top, nodded.\nIn front of him was a nameplate.\n[Chairman Shin Song-yu of Chunshin Group.]\nBut his real name was Chun Yu-seong.\nThe eldest son of Chun Woo-jin, the imprisoned Lord of the Sky Demon Order.\nAnd this faction was known to be the strongest among the three.\n“Chairman. Is that person really right?”\n“Why are you suspicious? Mong?”\nThe middle-aged man in glasses sitting in the second left seat was the managing director Mong Jeon-mu.\nClan leader of the Dream Sword Clan, one of the highest clans.\n“There is truth to Mong Jeon-mu’s words. It isn’t that I don’t believe in their judgements, but there is nothing wrong with being careful.”\nSaid the man with a large nose who was sitting on the other side.\nHe was Sa Ma-kyung.\nDirector of the Chunshin group and clan leader of the Samu clan.\nAt those words, a bald middle-aged man with white eyebrows opposed it.\n“But if he is Chun Ma, then we have amazing strength.”\nYang Ja-myung, the managing director.\nClan leader of North Demon Clan.\n“Isn’t that evidence that Chun Ma is helping us?”\n“Vice-chairman.”\nThe person sitting next to Chun Yu-seong was the vice-chairman of the Chunshin Group.\nThick eyebrows and thick lips.\nExuding great energy from his voice.\nHe was Wang Shin.\nClan leader of the Martial Dual Sword clan.\nHe was one of the three strongest warriors in the Cult after the Lord Chun Woo-jin and Great Guardian Marakyun.\nInitially, this clan didn’t belong to the Cult, but the clan leader Wang Jing had brought it under the Cult during the time of Chun Yeowun.\n“Maybe heaven is helping us?”\n“For the Great Guardian and the Left Guardian who were wandering around for 27 years in search of that secret prison to be joining us.”\nAt Wang Shin’s words, Chun Yu-seong smiled.\nIt happened a while ago.\nBoth the Great Guardian and the Left Guardian asked him to become the new Lord.\n[Father, no, the Lord didn’t allow this, would it still be fine?]\n[We can no longer allow the Lord’s position to remain empty. Chairman Chun Yu-seong, the eldest son, should be the one taking the role and reintegrate our Cult.]\nThe confrontation between the three factions had lasted for too long.\nThe Great Guardian, who judged that it would be difficult for the Cult to stay alive without a Lord, decided to unite it.\nIn the end, in order to rebuild the Cult, someone had to be crowned the Lord, so they decided to give that role to the eldest person, Chun Yu-seong.\nThe vice-chairman continued.\n“This is Chun Yeowun we are talking about. Besides, if it is the former Lord who notarizes the ceremony of the chairman, wouldn’t that be the best?”\nWang Shin spoke loudly again. Most people in the room nodded their heads.\nBut some didn’t.\n“Shouldn’t we be thinking what would happen if Chun Ma decides not to notarize this or has already sided with another faction?”\nOne of the people in the room strongly pointed out.\nClearly, that would be the worst-case scenario for them.\nLooking at the members, Chun Yu-seong mumbled.\n“I’ll make it happen somehow.”\nAt around 9 at night.\nAn underground high-speed train had arrived in Baoding City.\nChun Yeowun looked a bit bored as he wasn’t used to being inside tunnels.\n‘But it is fast.’\nHe just wasn’t used to sitting still for 14 hours.\nBut this looked better than moving on horses, and the scenery around did look nice.\n‘The Gates seem to have taken a lot.’\nHe knew that due to the Gate, people of this era lost a lot.\nGeneral manager Ko Wang-hyeon led Chun Yeowun to the platform.\n“The car is waiting outside. Let’s go.”\nAs they climbed up to the first floor on the escalator, he heard voices.\n[What a big chest. How long do I have to wait here?]\n[I told you not to call me like that!]\n[If you are so dissatisfied with it, then I’ll just call you something else.]\n[You really!]\n[Be silent for two minutes, please.]\nChun yeowun groaned.\n“They arrived.”\n“Huh?”\nKo Wang-hyeon wondered about what Chun Yeowun said, but he knew it.\n“Vice-chairman!”\n“Master!”\nTwo women were waiting outside and approached them.\nThey were Chun Yeowun’s exclusive secretaries, Yu So-hwa the Gravity Witch and Shakena.\nAs they were so beautiful, people kept looking back as they passed them.\n“Lord Chun Ma. Who are those women... uh? You!”\nKo wang-hyeon couldn’t hide his shock when he found someone following the woman.\nIt was Bi Mak-heon.\nThere was no way that he didn’t know the man. He was from the upper sect of the Phantom Sword clan.\n‘Manager Ko!’\nChak!\nThat was the same with Bi Mak-heon, who reached for his sword.\nThey were now in a hostile relationship.\nSeeing each other, they couldn’t hold back raising their energy.\n“How dare you set foot in here?”\nAt Ko Wang-hyeon’s words, Bi Mak-heon said.\n“You are speaking as if I entered a place I shouldn’t have. Ah, so Chun Yu-seong has to be in Baoding and not Beijing, Manager Ko Wang-hyeon.”\nAt those words, Ko Wang-hyeon’s eyes flared.\n“It seems like you don’t want to go back alive.”\nIt was true that Bi Mak-heon was from a higher clan, but he was at Super Master level when Ko Wang-hyeon was at Superior Master level.\nSo he was confident that he could defeat Bi Mak-heon.\nIt was then.\n“Harassing him. Human?”\nShakena intervened.\nIt was because she sensed the energy flowing from Ko Wang-hyeon.\n“I don’t know who this lady is, but if she is involved...”\nSwosh!\n“Huak!”\nAt that moment, Shakena’s hand turned transparent and dug into Ko Wang-hyeon’s chest.\nHer phasing ability.\n“W-what is this?”\nGrab!\n“Kuak!”\nShe grabbed his heart.\nStartled at the sudden pain, he wasn’t sure what happened.\nBut the only thing he could understand, was that a slight harm to the people on her side, and she would crush his head.\n“Huak... Huak...”\nShakena, who looked at Chun Yeowun while grabbing Ko Wang-hyeon’s heart, asked with a bright smile.\n“Master. This human. Can I kill him? I am acting as your slave.”\nWith those words, Shakena licked her lips.\nShe seemed like she wanted to kill the man, who seemed strong.\n‘W-what is that expression!’\nKo Wang-hyeon’s face turned pale as he looked at the woman, who looked like a hungry predator.\nChun Yeowun responded to her.\n“No.”\n“Fine...”\nShe pulled out her hand right away.\nThud!\nKo Wang-hyeon, who managed to stay alive, fell down to the floor in cold sweat.\n‘That woman. What is she?’\nEven the Right Guardian was shocked.\nHer abilities were terrifying and dangerous to exist.\n‘Who?’\nShe didn’t seem like a warrior. And Chun Yeowun wasn’t explaining anything.\n“Secretaries will accompany me. It shouldn’t matter, right?”\n“Yes? Secretaries?”\nRight Guardian looked at Shakena with a puzzled expression.\nThe woman who could easily take down a Superior Master level warrior, was just a secretary?\nA restaurant located to the east of Baoding city.\nA scenery of a small lake.\nA wonderful place decorated with nice pictures.\nIt was a place where lovers would usually hang out.\nHowever, men in suits with weapons in their arms, were inside.\nIt seemed like a group of people had arrived there.\nAround 10 that night.\nKik!\nA grey van arrived at the parking lot.\nMen in suits, who were walking in and out, rushed ahead and stood in line.\nClick!\nThe van’s door opened.\nManager Ko Wang-hyeon and the Right Guardian got out.\n“We are here.”\n“Hmm.”\nAnd then came Chun Yeowun in his black suit.\nOn either side were his two secretaries and Bi Mak-heon following them.\nLooking around, Chun Yeowun asked.\n“Not at the company?”\n“Chairman Chun Yu-seong wanted to invite you to a meal, since you must have been through a lot to come here.”\n“That so? Is he the one?”\nIn the restaurant, ten middle-aged men walked up and stood in front of Chun Yeowun.\nTak!\nThe chairman was the one who was standing in the front. And the rest were all middle-aged people of the Chunshin Group.\nObviously, as they gathered, the air around turned heavy.\nSh!\nChun Yu-seong glanced at the vice-chairman who was next to him.\nWang Shin nodded his head and sent a message.\n[Right.]\nAmong them, Wang Shin was the strongest.\nThe moment Wang Shin saw Chun Yeowun, he was confused.\nFrom the outside, he looked like a normal warrior.\nHowever, this meant that Chun Yeowun had reached a level where he could freely manipulate the energy.\nAnd the simple verification was done.\nPak!\nChun Yu-seong knelt on both knees and shouted.\n“Chun Yu-seong greets the great Chun Ma!”\nThud!\nOnce he said that, the other members who were behind all bowed down in the same way.\n“We greet the great Chun Ma!!!”\nPerfect execution.\nChun Yu-seong, who already knew about Chun Yeowun’s attitude from Ko Wang-hyeon, was fully prepared not to anger him.\nAnd the start didn’t seem so bad.\nChun Yeowun, the Chun Ma.\nChun Yu-seong wanted to obtain the notary of this person and be crowned the Lord.\n‘I need to make it happen.’\nThat was his real goal.\nAt that time, Chun Yu-seong’s body was raised up by energy.\n“Ugh!”\nAs his body flew, Chun Yeowun approached him.\nHe thought that Chun Yeowun would feel nice seeing his bloodline act respectfully towards him.\nChun Yeowun looked at him with curious eyes and said.\n“It is fine to be polite. But why do I feel like you are trying to play some tricks?”",

      "content": "Chun Yu-seong looked at Chun Yeowun with a puzzled expression.\nIt was as if nothing could be hidden.\n“No! How can I do that to the great Chun Ma, my ancestor?”\nChun Yu-seong looked at Chun Yeowun with scared eyes.\nChun Yeowun, who was looking at him suspiciously, calmed down.\nWoong!\nOnce the energy surrounding his body disappeared, Chun Yu-seong was able to move freely.\n“Thank you.”\nChun Yu-seong bowed 90 degrees to show respect.\nHis eyes, which were looking at the ground, narrowed.\n‘We can’t act vigilantly.’\nChun Yu-seong sighed.\nHe was grateful that he had run too many simulations in his mind for this situation.\nIf it wasn’t for the simulations, he would have failed before even starting.\n‘A legend is a legend. Too sharp!’\nHe thought that getting the notarization might be difficult. Chun Yeowun didn’t have a single ounce of trust in his eyes.\nHowever, he wasn’t hostile either.\n‘I can’t read his thoughts. But I am sure that he doesn’t have any trust in me.’\nConvincing this kind of person was the most difficult.\nHowever, all the preparations were done.\n“Hmm.”\nChun Yeowun’s eyes looking at the bowing Chun Yu-seong had a questionable expression.\nEverything seemed to be the opposite of what he was told.\n[I am sorry to say this as he is from our bloodline, but the eldest son, Chairman Chun Yu-seong is really frivolous. There are many rumors that the second son Chun Yu-jang would be the one to take over the position of the Lord as the eldest son has no talent in martial arts.]\nThose were the words Geum Oh-yeon had said.\nFrom what he heard, the eldest son was weak.\nIt was wrong.\n‘He is better at martial arts than Chun Yu-jang.’\nThe energy he felt was all the proof he needed.\nHe was on the verge of reaching the end stage of Superior Master level.\nIn addition, he calculated every move.\n[Lord Chun Ma. Our chairman has changed. Now, more than anyone else, he wants to save the Cult.]\nThat was what Ko Wang-hyeon had said to Chun Yeowun.\nDid the man really change?\nChun Yu-seong, who got up, bowed politely again.\n“Ancestor. Why don’t we go inside instead of staying here? We have prepared a meal too.”\nAlthough the lights were on, the outside wasn’t the right place to talk.\nAnd when Chun Yeowun’s permitted it, Chun Yu-seong directly led him to the restaurant.\nThe layout of the room was unique.\nThere were three rooms, but each had sliding walls in between.\nThis room had three tables.\nA long table with only two seats facing each other.\nAnd then, two small tables were placed for a large number of people to sit.\nNext to the room, was an open kitchen where chefs in white clothes were preparing the dishes.\nTaktak!\nThe sound of a knife hitting the board and the smell of soup boiling, filled the room.\n“Please sit here.”\nChun Yu-seong guided him to the table with just two seats.\n“Secretaries and those...”\nChun Yu-seong looked at Bi Mak-heon.\nIt was because he knew that that man belonged to the Chun Yu-jang faction.\n“It has been long, chairman.”\n“Huhu, you are pretty bold. Coming here with our ancestor.”\n“I only serve Lord Chun Ma.”\n“I hope you understand that we cannot give you a seat close to our ancestor.”\nIt was something he couldn’t understand.\nBi Mak-heon was in the middle of an enemy camp.\nBut he didn’t say anything, just a little sign of nervousness here and there.\n“Since the relationship in the family isn’t that great, would it be fine for him and the secretaries to sit at the table over there?”\nChun Yu-seong asked Chun Yeowun for permission.\nIt didn’t matter, so Chun Yeowun nodded, but Shakena mumbled.\n“I want to sit next to master.”\nOf course, it wasn’t because she was worried about him. She just didn’t want to be away from him.\n“Even if we are at different tables, we are eating in the same space, so I hope the beautiful secretaries will understand.”\nChun Yu-seong spoke in a polite and soft manner. He kind of liked the exotic-looking woman.\nThe love for beauty was something all men had in common.\nHowever, Shakena didn’t care about that, so she turned away with a frowning expression and mumbled under her breath.\n“What did you say? You human subject.”\n“Huh?”\nFor a moment, he doubted his ears.\nBut because he was in front of Chun Yeowun, he didn’t react.\nLike Shakena, Yu So-hwa had a blunt expression as well.\nShe bowed before heading to the third table with SHakena.\n‘Arrogant ones.’\nChun Yu-seong clicked his tongue and sat.\n“Oolong tea, sir.”\nPour!\nAs they sat down, a pretty woman in a waitress costume came over and poured the hot tea for Chun Yeowun.\nOnce everyone was seated, Chun Yu-seong said.\n“Each of us will greet the Chun Ma one after another, sir.”\nAs if waiting, people began to come to introduce themselves and greet him.\nThe first one was, of course, Wang Shin, the vice-chairman.\nPa!\nKneeling on one knee and bowing, he said.\n“Wang Shin of the Dual Martial Sword clan. It is an honor to meet Lord Chun Ma, who took us in.”\n‘Oh ho!’\nChun Yeowun’s eyes lit up.\nHe had indeed invited Wang Jing to his Cult and given him the position of Great Elder, but he hadn’t settled in the Cult yet.\nNow it was a clan under the Cult.\n‘He is supposed to be the best.’\nIn his time, Wang Jing was one of the Five Strongest Warriors.\nAnd he was now probably the strongest in the Cult.\nThe other people began to stand up and introduce themselves too.\n“I am Jeon-mu of the Dream Swordsmanship clan. It is an honor to meet the great Chun Ma.”\nWhen all the seniors finished the greetings, Chun Yu-seong pointed to the bald man with no hair, who looked like a chef.\n“I forgot about the most important person. This is the chef. He is a famous chef who received 3 Michelin stars in his career as the main chef in the 5-star hotels of Beijing. As his cooking suits my taste, I often come here.”\nAt Chun Yu-seong’s words, the man bowed.\n“Yeo Mun-hyung.”\n“We look forward to delicious dishes.”\n“Yes, chairman.”\nChef Yeo Mun-hyung answered with a smile and returned to cooking.\nFrom the kitchen side, employees were busy moving around bringing dishes to the dinner table.\nThe start of the meal was soup.\n“This is the Crabmeat Soup.”\n“Please have some. Ancestor.”\nWhen the waiter put down the dish, Chun Yu-seong invited Chun Yeowun to try it.\nWhile everyone was waiting for him to raise his spoon and take a spit, Chun Yeowun shook his head and asked.\n“Enough about the food, get to the point.”\n“Huh? I heard that you didn’t eat anything on the train.”\n“Did you think I came to see you and have dinner with you?”\n“....”\nThe atmosphere within the room, which was supposed to be brightened and happy, turned gloomy at the cold tone.\n‘This won’t be easy.’\nChun Yu-seong was trying to create a relaxed atmosphere through food and alcohol.\nBut Chun Yeowun didn’t look like he wanted any of those.\n“Sigh, we can’t help it.”\n“Start from why I was called here.”\nChun Yu-seong stood up at Chun yeowun’s question.\nTak!\nHe knelt and bowed his head.\n“Lord Chun Ma must have met with Chun Yu-jang, so I think you are aware of the current situation of the Cult.”\n“A total mess.”\nAt that, Chun Yu-seong banged his head on the floor.\nChun Yeowun’s eyes narrowed at the sudden action.\n“What are you doing?”\n“Forgive me! All this happened because of my weakness. If I had not been stupid and had managed to be strong, the Cult would have never been divided.”\nThe man seemed to have accurate judgement.\nWhen the Lord was taken away, if he had the strength to maintain such a strong position in the absence of the Lord, this split in the Cult would have never happened.\n“You seem to have realized it quite quickly.”\n“I have no excuses. Even if I have to be punished, I will accept it.”\n‘This one...’\nA completely different attitude from Chun Yu-jang.\nThis guy was the kind to grab hold of people.\nTak!\nWhen Chun Yu-seong, who was bowing, snapped his fingers, a member standing at the entrance came in with a briefcase.\nHe took out a tablet PC from it and placed it in front of Chun Yeowun.\nA PDF document was displayed on it.\n“And this is?”\nChun Yu-seong answered.\n“Please read it.”\nThe title was written on the first page of the PDF document.\n[Sky Demon Order Resurrection Plan]\nChun Yeowun tapped on the tablet and turned over the pages.\nIn the PDF document, the plans to revive the Sky Demon Order by the Chun Yu-seong faction were planned in detail.\nShh! Shh!\n‘Is he even reading it?’\nThe pages were being turned too fast.\nIt was practically just flipping through it within seconds, and everyone wondered if he was really reading it.\n100 PDF pages within 2 minutes.\nAfter reading all that, Chun Yeowun smiled.\n“This is your plan?”\n“Yes.”\nUnlike before, Chun Yu-seong looked at Chun Yeowun with nervous eyes.\nIf he read the PDF, then everything was written in detail.\nMore than 70 percent of the plan was done.\n“I am well aware that my ancestor cannot turn a blind eye to the mistakes we made. However, please, give me a chance. Even if it means for me to take a punishment, I will be sure to bring the Cult back to life.”\nThud!\nChun Yu-seong banged his head on the floor once again.\nHe wanted to move Chun Yeowun’s heart as much as he could.\n‘Perfect plan.’\nIt was a proud plan.\nIf the plan could be executed, the Sky Demon Order would be able to rise again.\nHe thought that since Chun yeowun was the ancestor, he wouldn’t ignore it.\n‘If it is for the sake of reviving the Cult, then he has no choice but to help me out. Even if you were a legend in the past, you aren’t the Lord of this time.’\nAnd if Chun Yeowun agreed to help, the plan would go much faster.\nHe was, after all, one of the three strongest legends of the Cult.\n‘What will he do?’\nAt that point, Chun Yeowun picked up the tablet and said.\n“It sounds pretty good.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, Chun Yu-seong’s face brightened.\n“You understand....”\nBut Chun Yeowun cut off his words.\n“However, the first premise of all these plans is that you become the Lord, right?”\n“Yes.”\nThe basic premise for unifying the Cult.\nSince everyone was fighting for that position, it felt natural that he wanted to be appointed as the Lord. That way, the conflict between the three factions would come to an end.\n“The conflict between the three will lead to endless bloodshed.”\nA reasonable statement.\nChun Yeowun asked in a colder voice.\n“So, you will take the Lord position of the Cult first without even reintegrating the Cult?”\n“Once we release that order, we can bring back the members of the Cult.”\n“Who talked about this order?”\nChun Yu-seong smiled at the question and answered.\n“The Great Guardian, Order of the Sky Demon, had agreed to do it.”\nThe one who proposed it was the Great Guardian.\nThe Great Guardian had the authority to use the Order of the Sky Demon and select the next Lord, if the current one was absent.\n“Once the Order of the Sky Demon is activated. The Cult members of the two other factions wouldn’t be able to deny it.”\nChun Yu-seong’s hidden card.\nOne could never imagine how much it cost him to convince the Great Guardian to agree to this.\nThe Order of Sky Demon has the seal of the 1st Chun Ma.\nNo one could resist it.\nExcept for one person.\n‘Chun Ma.’\nBecause he held the title of Chun Ma.\nIf Chun Yeowun didn’t acknowledge it, then everything would be in vain.\nHowever, if thought the other way, if Chun Yeowun was to agree to it, then all the members of the other factions would willingly come under Chun Yu-seong.\nThud!\nChun Yu-seong banged his head.\n“Please lend me your strength so we can unite the Cult before any more bloodshed happens. Please notarize the inauguration as Lord!”\nThud! Thud!\nAt his cry, the other Cult members fell on the floor, banged their heads, and pleaded.\n“Please notarize it!!!”\nEveryone asked with earnestness.\nHowever, Chun Yu-seong, who was bowing his head to the ground, didn’t have that kind of expression.\n/strong>\nHis lips turned into a smile.\n‘This is the right atmosphere. If you really care about the Cult, you wouldn’t be able to deny this request.’",

      "content": "The plan was laid properly.\nChun Yu-seong wasn’t reckless.\nOnly one chance.\nIf Chun Yeowun didn’t allow it, then he could use it against him and put him in a bad light.\n‘Yes or no?’\nHe waited for Chun Yeowun’s answer.\nEverything depended on it.\nAnd Chun Yeowun opened his mouth.\n“Stop rolling your head to make things work out only for you.”\nThe result was negative.\nChun Yu-seong erased his obedient face and raised his head.\n“Are you going to act emotional at this time?”\n“Are you sure that you didn’t ask an unreasonable request, which is only in your favor?”\n“Nothing can be done.”\nShh!\nChun Yu-seong got up from his seat and snapped his finger.\nSnap!\nChanges occurred in the seat where Chun Yeowun was sitting. A transformation occurred in the floor with a 2 meters radius.\nRed LED lights turned on, and a noise was heard from the floor.\nClang! Clang!\nThe lights in the restaurant weakened due to the enormous power consumption.\n“Is this another joke?”\n“Huhu, I have no malice towards the ancestor. Because of your nature, I did expect this kind of answer to some extent. I knew you wouldn’t go along with this.”\nWith that, Chun Yu-seong looked at someone.\nIt was the chef, Yeo Mun-hyung.\nWith the blink of an eye, he extended his hand towards Chun Yeowun.\nJkkk!\nEverything around Chun yeowun froze, except for the head.\nChun Yeowun couldn’t move.\n“Ha?”\nChun Yu-seong smiled.\n“Did you think that I didn’t prepare anything against you, the legend of the Cult?”\nThe chair where Chun Yeowun was sitting had a device installed in it.\nIt had handcuffs which block the internal energy like the ones used by the Public Security Bureau.\nHowever, the effect was 100 times greater.\nAnd in order to restrain Chun Yeowun, the greatest warrior, they were using electricity from 1km of the area.\n“Even if you are my ancestor, we can’t let you go around.”\n“How dare you!”\nBi Mak-heon tried to get up.\nChak!\n“Don’t move.”\nMon Jeon-mu placed his sword on his neck and warned him.\nThe same with Shakena and Yu So-hwa.\nThe highest members in the faction appeared and placed their swords on their necks.\n“I really didn’t want to use swords against pretty girls.”\nSa Ma-kyung warned.\nAt that time, Yu So-hwa looked at the chef and said.\n“Ice Demon!”\n“Huh. I guess you weren’t just an ordinary secretary.”\nChun Yu-seong was amazed when she named him.\nThe chef Yeo Mun-hyun was a talented person with a long past.\nThe face had changed a lot, so the only way to recognize it was with the abilities.\n‘How is he?’\nIce Demon.\nHe had the ability to create an ice storm in an area of 100 meters.\nEven before the SS-class was introduced, he held a reputation for being an S-class keeper.\nHe was so talented that people said if the SS-class was present at that time, he would be the first one.\n‘He is supposed to be in prison...’\nThe man disappeared 8 years ago.\nSupposed to be imprisoned in a secret prison for using his abilities to kill civilians.\nChun Yu-seong looked at Chun Yeowun and said.\n“The Guardians weren’t the only ones who tried to save my father who is being imprisoned. I searched for a long time as well.”\nAnd he found this man when he was searching in the secret prisons.\nChun Yu-seong looked at someone who stood behind Chun Yeowun and said.\n“Start it.”\n“Yes.”\nThe woman who poured him tea, supposedly an employee, seemed to be a servant of Chun Yu-seong.\nShe approached Chun Yeowun, whose body was frozen.\n“What are you trying to do?”\n“I don’t intend to harm you, Lord Chun Ma. I am just trying to change your perception of me.”\n“Change my perception?”\n“She has the ability to manipulate others’ memories. A dangerous ability. She and the chef were imprisoned in the secret prison. We can’t let such good people rot in prison, right?”\nChun Yu-seong asked.\nShe was the reason he didn’t mind meeting Chun Yeowun.\nIn case of rejection, the plan was to manipulate Chun Yeowun’s memory.\n‘I can get my hands on the Demon God!’\nHis lips slowly turned into a smile just thinking about it.\nThe female employee asked him.\n“How should I change it?”\n“Hmm, I’d love to have a teacher who cares for me.”\nHe took into account the eyes of others.\nIt was impossible to keep Chun Yeowun as his subordinate.\nSo all he needed was to make Chun Yeowun follow him.\nAfter she thought of a specific manipulation of memory, she took Chun Yeowun’s hand.\nThat was when Chun Yeowun said.\n“Is the reason why I couldn’t feel the demonic energy also a part of the plan?”\nChun Yu-seong answered while laughing.\n“Hahaha, isn’t that obvious? If our ancestor commanded us to harm ourselves, we would have done it as you possess the Sky Demon energy, we can’t do that.”\nChun Yu-seong was prepared.\nDespite the fact that the demonic energy could amplify martial arts, he discarded it.\nTo be free from the control of the Sky Demon Order.\n“Forgive my disloyalty. If the Cult is brought back, I will surely ask for forgiveness.”\nChun Yu-seong wasn’t hiding his feelings anymore.\nHe felt happy that he managed to trap Chun yeowun, a great Lord, with his plan.\n“Forgiveness?”\nChun Yeowun sighed.\nA look of disappointment.\nChun Yu-seong, who was convinced that he won, joked.\n“I am sure those emotions will turn into affection...”\n“You won’t do.”\n“Huh?”\nIt was then.\n“Kuak!”\nThe female employee who reached out to Chun Yeowun, coughed up blood.\nAnd with a pale face, she grabbed her chest, stepping backward as she fell down.\n“Ahhh!”\nShe screamed as she convulsed.\n“What? What is with her?”\n“My heart... my heart... kyaaak!”\nChun Yu-seong was shocked at that, but that wasn’t the end.\nJjkkk!\nA crack appeared in the ice covering Chun Yeowun’s body.\nChun Yu-seong was dumbfounded.\n‘How is this...?’\nAn industrial machine was the one drawing the electricity.\nChun Yeowun shouldn’t be able to move as he couldn’t draw out his internal energy.\n“Damn it!”\nYeo Mun-hyung, who noticed that, reached out to him.\nWheeing!\nCold ice rushed for Chun Yeowun, and this time, it was aiming to cover the entire body.\nIt was then, Chun Yeowun’s body began to burn up and burst into flames.\nWheik!\n“F-fire?”\nThe heat radiating from his body was beyond one’s imagination.\nThe ice turned into water and then evaporated.\nSwooh!\nFlustered, Yeo Mun-hyung tried to draw more power.\nAt that time, his body was lifted and pulled into Chun Yeowun’s hand.\nGrab!\n“KuaK!”\n“A cook should be used to the flames.”\nWheik!\n“Kuak!”\nFire flowed from the hand which was holding the chef.\nEven when he tried to cool his body with ice, the difference between the two wasn’t something the chef could handle.\nWheeik\n!\n“Kuaaak!”\nFlames engulfed the body.\nThe chef screamed and screamed, trying to get away from the grasp of Chun Yeowun until his body turned to nothing but ashes.\nPssss!\nChun Yeowun threw the head, which wasn’t burned, to the ground.\nAnd then trampled it with his feet.\nCrush!\n“N-no way!”\nShocked, Chun Yu-seong got up.\nChun Yeowun turned his head towards him and stepped forward.\nBang!\nPachik!\nSparks shone from the cracked floors. The air conditioning in the room which had been installed was destroyed.\n‘How did this happen...’\nDespite having a thorough plan, he wasn’t able to control Chun Yeowun.\nHow could one not be affected by so many forces?\nIt wasn’t just that which shocked him.\nPuck!\n“Kuak!”\nWhen he turned his head, he saw an officer employee lying on the floor with Shakena clutching a bloody heart.\nAnd she asked with a bright smile.\n“Master. Can I eat it?”\n“W-what crazy bitch!”\nShocked, the others tried to attack her.\nBang!\n“Kuak!”\nThey all ended up turning suppressed by the gravity and crushed to the floor.\nIt was Yu So-hwa who caused it.\n“Kuaak!”\nSuper Master level warriors couldn’t even lift their heads, and when one person tried to get up. Yu So-hwa lifted her finger.\nBang!\n“Kuak!”\nThe body dug deeper into the ground. The others could hear the sound of bones being crushed.\n‘Damn those bitches...’\nHe thought they were normal secretaries, but they were monsters.\nIt was absurd.\nChun Yeowun reached close to him, exuding intimidating energy.\n‘Hik!’\nConfused, Chun Yu-seong tried to step back, but his body didn’t move.\nIt wasn’t out of fear.\n‘M-my body...’\nThe profound energy was what was holding him.\nAnd it was obvious who was doing it.\nRealizing that he was done for, he changed his tactics.\n“A-ancestor!”\nHe tried to kneel down and beg.\nChak!\nAt that moment, he felt something, and when he looked down, a red line appeared on his thighs.\n‘!?’\nA straight horizontal line.\nChun Yu-seong’s body, which had both legs cut off, fell forward.\nThud!\nHe was in terrible pain.\n“Kuaaak! Aaccckkkk!”\nGulp\n!\nChun Yeowun stepped on Chun Yu-seong’s head who was writhing in pain, and pressed on it.\nHe stepped on it so hard that it looked like the head would burst.\n“Kuaaak! A-ancestor! Please... please! Forgive me!”\nPress!\nHe begged and begged, but the leg didn’t.\n“Kuaak! Ancestor! Ancestor! I-am your blood descendant! Blood descendant of you!”\nIn a cold voice, Chun Yeowun responded.\n“So what.”",

      "content": "Slash!\n“Kuak!”\nThe sound of cracking could clearly be heard.\nSomeone shouted as people were screaming in pain.\n“Stop it!”\n‘Vice-chairman!’\nThe voice belonged to Wang Shin, the Vice-chairman.\nWhen Chun Yeowun looked at him, Wang Shin extended his hand towards the outside of the room.\nBang!\nTwo large swords, large enough to destroy the entrance, flew in.\nSwoosh!\nCompletely different from regular swords.\nThe gigantic sword was longer than an adult male body and had a blade width of 80cm.\nIt was the dual swords.\n“It has been a long time since I saw the dual swords.”\nContrary to his words, Chun Yeowun still looked cold.\n“Let the chairman go!”\nWas it loyalty to the person he served?\nWang Shin boldly swung the two swords at Chun Yeowun.\nWoong!\nDue to the weight and width of the sword, the sound it produced when swinging it was different.\nThe pair of swords sure had the momentum to destroy everything in front of them, however.\nPak!\nSuch destructive swords were blocked by Chun Yeowun’s bare palm.\n‘!?’\nBlocking those ferocious swords with bare hands was ridiculous, but Wang Shin didn’t stop his attacks.\nSwish! Thud!\nWang Shin boldly pulled back one sword and used it again. This time, He spun his body to add additional power.\n“Huaaah!”\nSwoooosh!\nMartial Dual Sword.\nThe power to destroy the whole restaurant with a single blow.\nSuch swords were engulfed in energy aiming to take down Chun Yeowun.\n“Your transition is good.”\nBut the gap between the two was too wide.\nChun Yeowun smashed down the swords.\nThud!\n“Huh?”\nThe two swords, which were countered by Chun Yeowun, were split in half.\nTherefore, the broken pair of swords didn’t even reach Chun Yeowun.\n“Your loyalty should be directed to me. Descendant of Wang Jing.”\nChun Yeowun changed his form and extended his hand towards Wang Shin.\nA hazy sword appeared in the air and was placed on Wang Shin’s shoulder.\nPuck!\n“In-invisible Sword!”\nWoong!\n“Euk!”\nThanks to the devastating power of the invisible sword, Wang Shin flew back and was stuck into the wall.\nBang!\n“Kuak!”\nA truly bizarre phenomenon.\nThe sharpness of the invisible sword could definitely have cut Wang Shin’s shoulder, but it didn’t.\nThe invisible sword maintained its form while holding the man on the wall.\n‘Does this mean that even the vice-chairman isn’t his opponent?’\n‘What unbelievable strength!’\nThe others couldn’t hide their shock.\nWang Shin, who reached the end of Superior Master, was easily subdued.\nLike a child trying to defeat an adult.\nMunch!\nThe sound of someone chewing.\nMembers of the Chun Yu-seong faction turned their heads towards the sound and saw Shakena take a bite of the heart and chew it.\nBlood was dripping from her lips.\nAn ecstatic expression was drawn on her face displaying how delicious it was.\n“Nice! So good!”\nDemons grow their power through predation.\nThe heart of Sa Ma-kyung, a Super master level warrior, was the best nourishment.\nBut it was a horror for the others to watch.\n‘... crazy bitch.’\nEven Yu So-hwa, who wasn’t normally shaken, frowned.\n‘S-she is eating the heart.’\n‘How can a human do such a hideous thing...’\nWell, she wasn’t human.\nThe terrifying scene was enough to drive them into fear. And any further resistance had died down.\n‘We shouldn’t provoke them any further.’\nOne of the members, Mong Jeon Mu of the Dream Sword clan, ran in front of Chun Yeowun and bowed while shouting.\nPak!\n“Lord Chun Ma! Please calm yourself!”\nThe other people, who realized now how monstrous the man acted, immediately fell down and began to shout.\n“Please calm yourself!!!”\nChun Yeowun looked at them in his cold expression and said.\n“Calm myself?”\nHearing that cold voice, everyone felt a chill run down their spines.\nMong Jeon Mu banged his head hard on the floor.\nBang!\nBlood dripped down from his forehead, but that didn’t matter to him.\nThey had to do something about the current situation and ensure that Chun Yeowun’s anger decreased even by a little.\n“We committed the act of disloyalty only to revive the Cult. I know this is unforgivable, but please consider the situation of the Cult...”\n“Kuaaal!”\nHaving said that, Mong Jeon Mu looked at Chun Yu-seong, whose head was being crushed under Chun Yeowun’s feet.\nChun Yu-seong’s half-face looked crooked. He was in a horrible condition.\nAnd if it wouldn’t be treated properly soon, it seemed like it could turn bad.\n“Lord Chun Ma! Please show mercy! The chairman never wanted to commit this blasphemy against Chun Ma! He will fully reflect on his actions. I will make sure that it will never repeat aga....”\n“You are a funny one.”\n“Yes?”\nAt that time, Chun Yeowun drew his sword towards him.\nAnd a red line appeared on his neck.\n‘!?’\nThe man’s eyes widened as he sensed that something strange had happened to him.\nEven the others, who were watching with their heads raised, were shocked, so shocked that they couldn’t hide their expression.\n“M-Mong Jeon Mu, don’t move...”\nSrrr!\nBefore one could even say anything, the neck slid down and fell.\nThe severed head which fell rolled on the floor.\nPhsss!\nBlood forcefully gushed out from the body.\nSeeing a high clan member die in such a way, the others were shocked.\nA high clan member was killed without the blink of an eye.\n‘How did this...’\nAmid the silence, Chun Yeowun opened his mouth.\n“This will never happen again? You are all speaking like this is normal dog shit. This shouldn’t have happened in the first place!”\nThey had no excuse.\nChun Yeowun was absolutely right.\nTheir intentions to control Chun Ma, the highest authority of the Sky Demon order, wasn’t something that could ever be forgiven.\n“And you people.”\nKuak!\n“Kuaaak!”\nWhen Chun Yeowun pressed even harder, Chun Yu-seong grunted in pain.\n‘I-is he going to kill me for real?’\nUntil a second back, he thought that he wouldn’t be killed.\nHowever, when the head of one of the senior clan members rolled in front of his eyes, he realized that everything he thought was wrong.\nChun Yu-seong shouted.\n“Ancestor! The company! I will hand over my company! Ancestor can lead us...”\n“Not needed.”\nChun Yeowun’s eyes were cold.\nIt wasn’t the way anyone would look at someone who shared his blood.\nChun Yu-seong, who noticed it, begged.\n“Ancestor.... Ancestor... please, please let me live. If Ancestor spares me, I will lick your shoes with my tongue. I will lick...”\nChun Yeowun looked down at him and mumbled at his pathetic words.\n“You are not worth sparing.”\n‘!!!’\nChun Yu-seong’s eyes widened in shock.\n“Lord? Stop dreaming. Just die now.”\nAs soon as Chun Yeowun said that, he put more strength to the foot holding Chun Yu-seong down.\n“A-ancestor! Ancestor...”\nCrack!\n“Ackkkkk!”\nCrush!\nThe head of Chun Yu-seong, whose face had been crushed, became one with the floor.\nThe body, which had been wriggling, went still.\n“Chairman!”\nPeople were shocked that the head of the Dream Sword clan had died, but they never thought that their chairman, a direct descendant who shared blood with Chun Yeowun, would be killed.\nDue to his loyalty to Chun Yu-seong, managing director Yang Ja-myung couldn’t hide his anger and shouted.\n“Lord Chun Ma! How... how can you do this? He is your descendant. To kill an heir to the Cult, if you were truly the ancestor...”\nBefore he could even finish speaking, Chun Yeowun reached his hand out to him.\nHis body floated and came rushing into Chun Yeowun’s hand.\nGrab!\n“Kuak!”\nYang Ja-myung tried to revolt and move but to no avail.\nChun Yeowun’s internal energy was too strong.\nLooking at the man struggling in his hand, Chun Yeowun spoke.\n“So what is that supposed to mean?”\n“Kuak... even beasts spare their cubs...”\n“Funny. Would someone who really regards me as an ancestor commit this?”\n“T-tha...”\nHe couldn’t respond.\nHe spoke up in anger because of his loyalty to Chun Yu-seong, but it was definitely Chun Yu-seong’s actions that had caused all this.\nChun Yu-seong had paved his own death.\n“And you agreed to this foolish plan, which is why you are here, right?”\n‘!?’\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, Yang Ja-myung realized his mistake.\n“L-Lord Chun Ma. It isn’t that...”\nChun Yeowun put his hand into the man’s mouth and grabbed it.\nGrab!\n“Euk!”\n“You should know what happens when you let the mouth run for itself.”\n“Kuekkkkk!”\nShocked, Yang Ja-myung held Chun Yeowun’s hand and tried to stop him from ripping out his lower jaw.\nHowever, his lower jaw was pulled apart.\n“Kuaaak!”\nCrack!\nYang Ja-myung, whose lower jaw was pulled out, screamed and cried out in a strange and horrible way.\nHe died of shock and blood loss.\nChun Yeowun threw his body to the floor.\nPak!\n“Haaa.”\nShakena, who was watching it, felt her body turn hot.\nAs a demon, she felt a weird excitement witnessing the cruelty of Chun Yeowun.\n‘So cool! He is so cool!’\nDefinitely a worthy master to her. She was the only one who admired him in that place.\nEveryone else was pale and afraid of Chun Yeowun.\n“You all should pay for this too.”\nChun Yeowun turned his gaze to the others.\nPak!\nAt that time, manager Ko Wag-hyeon hurriedly fell on the floor in front of Chun Yeowun.\n“Lord Chun Ma! Please stop! Are you really going to kill all the clan leaders in this place?”\nHe had no idea about the faction’s plans.\nWhich was why he was still unable to do anything.\nHowever, seeing the situation go out of control, he risked his life to dissuade Chun Yeowun.\n‘I need to convince him somehow.’\nHe saw that Chun Yeowun wouldn’t even forgive his own blood. So Ko Wang-hyeon took a different approach.\n“These are the clan leaders who lead the Cult. If all of them die, the power of the Cult will be weakened. Besides, who will lead their clans?”\nA glimmer of hope shone in the eyes of the clan leaders who were scared to death.\nAs said, they were the power of the Cult.\nAnd objectively thinking, it would be too much damage to the Cult if they were killed.\nDirector Lee Pyeong-woo helped out.\n“Y-yes. Lord Chun Ma. If you punish these many clan leaders, how can the Cult be reunited? Please! Have mercy...”\nPuck!\n“Kuak!”\nBefore he could even finish, something stabbed him in the back.\nAs he looked down, he saw the blade of something sharp and cold protruding out his body.\n“T-this?”\nCreepy!\nA chill could be felt spreading down his body.\nAs he listed his head, he saw dozens of ice swords aiming at the heads of the other clan leaders.\n“Air Swords!”\nThe people who noticed the Air Ice Swords couldn’t hide their bewilderment.\nChun Yeowun grabbed Lee Pyeong-woo who was in pain, and said.\n“You think you are the only ones who make the cult move? You are highly mistaken.”\n“There are no other clan...”\n“Despite all the clan leaders, the Cult stayed like this for 27 years?”\n“Th-that...”\nLee Pyeong-woo was speechless.\nThe cause of dissolving the clan was the power struggle between the three factions.\nNo excuse.\nChun Yeowun looked at the other clan leaders and said,\n“Blood? Clan leaders? Do you think that you could use this bullshit as a shield to save your lives? I’ll say this clearly so listen. You will all die here.”\nAt that, all the people began to plead.\n“L-Lord, Chun Ma!... please... please have mercy...”\n“Please give us a chance.”\nChun Yeowun sentenced them to death in a cold voice.\n“You should have pleaded from the beginning without thinking of playing tricks.”\nSwoosh! Swoosh!\nAs Chun Yeowun moved his fingers, the Ice Swords in the air rushed to their targets.",

      "content": "A restaurant, which should be filled with delicious aroma, was filled with the stench of blood.\n43 clan leaders turned into silent corpses.\nManager Ko Wang-hyeon and Right Guardian Sub-hyung looked at the bodies in bewildered eyes.\nThey hadn’t even dreamed that such a thing would happen.\n‘Ahhh, chairman. Why did you...’\nHe had seen the Lord Chun Ma with his own eyes.\nHe should have given importance to the reports they sent and the messages they kept giving.\nThud!\nKo Wang-hyeon knelt on the ground.\nChun Yu-seong, the next Lord of the Cult, was killed.\n‘It is my fault for not stopping the chairman!’\nKo Wang-hyeon was ashamed and unable to overcome his emotions.\n“Lord Chun Ma. I was disloyal too. I will pay with my life!”\nKo Wang-hyeon gathered internal energy on his fist.\nShocked, Sub-hyung shouted.\n“Manager Ko! You, what are you doing!”\n“Right Guardian. Please stay away from this.”\nAnd he tried to hit his head with his fist.\nHowever, it didn’t touch the head.\nA deep energy prevented that.\nTremble!\nChun Yeowun was stretching out his hand.\nKo Wang-hyeon looked at Chun Yeowun with red eyes and said.\n“Why would you stop it?”\n“I understand your loyalty, but are you not going to take responsibility for making the Cult like this?”\n“That...”\nAs the head of a clan that led the Sky Demon Order, he was responsible too.\nChun Yeowun stopped him.\nSub-hyung sent a message.\n[Manager Ko, no, Wang-hyeon. I will be honest because of my relationship with you. I decided to serve the eldest son too. However, he did break the law of the Cult in a very wrong way.]\nThe Right Guardian was shocked at the incident too.\nChun Yeowun’s punishment, which didn’t differentiate between his own blood and the other clan leaders, was an extraordinary move.\nBut it wasn’t a wrong move.\nThe title ‘Chun Ma’ meant the Sky Demon Order itself, it wasn’t just a name.\n‘Trying to brainwash Chun Ma.’\nNo member of the Sky Demon order would even dare to think of it.\nIt was no different than Catholics and Buddhists intending to indoctrinate Jesus and Buddha.\n[But...]\n[Wang-hyeon. The moment the chairman did that, we were disbanded. Didn’t we make an oath to revive the Cult? Are you going to break down the oath?]\nAt the words of the Right Guardian, Ko Wang-hyeon bowed.\nIt reminded him of that day.\n27 years back, when all members were shedding tears of blood.\nCrush!\nKo Wang-hyeon clenched his fist as he remembered that day, and bowed his head.\n“I ended up trying to do something foolish. I will surely revive the Cult and pay for the sin I committed.”\n“Huh.”\nChun Yeowun looked at the Right Guardian.\nA look of admiration.\nShocked at the sudden eye contact, Sub-hyung bowed his head.\n‘What?’\nIt felt as if he heard their communication.\nChun Yeowun was able to hear other people’s telepathic conversations with the help of Nano.\nChun Yeowun approached Wang Shin, who was still hanging on the wall.\nHis head was bowed with a resigned look.\n“Was it Wang Shin? Descendant of Wang jing?”\n“Lord Chun Ma.”\nHe raised his head, his eyes were lost.\nSeeing that, Chun Yeowun knew that the man was prepared to die.\n“Why didn’t you kill me as well? Is this another form of punishment? For committing disloyalty to you?”\nWang Shin asked in a bitter voice.\nHe saw the death of his comrades with his own eyes. The head they were supposed to serve was also dead.\nHe had a strong desire to die with them.\n“You rushed at me knowing you would die.”\nUnlike others, Wang Shin rushed at Chun Yeowun, knowing how powerful the Demon God was.\nThe gap between earth and heaven.\nNevertheless, to save Chun Yu-seong, he swung his sword, ready to die.\n“... I apologize. Please kill me.”\nNo other person in that place had shown that courage.\n“You were alright.”\n“Yes?”\nAt the unexpected compliment, Wang Shin looked puzzled.\nChun Yeowun valued his resolution despite knowing the capabilities of the opponent.\nWhich was why he didn’t kill the man.\nAnd.\n‘He was blocked by a wall.’\nWith only one technique, Chun Yeowun understood it.\nThe Current Wang Shin could enter the next level with just a little awareness.\n‘It is rare. He has the potential to reach Supreme Master level.’\nUnlike the Superior Master level, the Supreme Master level was a totally different thing.\nAnd he didn’t want to kill someone who could achieve that.\nWang Shin spoke to Chun Yeowun, who was in thought.\n“Are you trying to make me feel disgraced by keeping me alive alone? I am a sinner. Please kill me.”\n“Kill you?”\n“The sin of harming Chun Ma cannot be forgiven. For the sake of a better future for the Cult, behead me too.”\nPak!\nWang Shin clasped his hands together and bowed his head.\nChun Yeowun’s lips turned into a smile.\n‘I like him.’\nIf he begged to be saved even once, Chun Yeowun would’ve killed him right away.\nBut the man admitted his wrongdoings and was ready to accept death.\nThat wasn’t an easy thing to do.\nEven Chun Yu-seong, who had the same blood as Chun Yeowun, begged to be saved in the face of death.\n“Please give me death.”\nWith stubborn eyes, Wang Shin looked at Chun Yeowun.\nChun Yeowun shook his head and raised his hand.\n“If you want it, then I’ll give it to you.”\nPak!\nAt that time, Ko Wang-hyeon and Sub-hyung knelt down and begged Chun Yeowun.\n“Lord Chun Ma. Vice-chairman Wang Shin is an indispensable talent for the Cult. He runs the Chunshin group in reality. Please let him live.”\n“Killing such a talent would be wrong. Please reconsider this just once more!”\nKilling Wang Shin didn’t seem right.\nWang Shin was a proclaimed warrior.\nNot only that, but he was also good at handling business and management. He was the one who placed the current Chunshin Group in the top 50 of the business world.\nIf he was going to die, the Chunshin group was bound to collapse.\n“Please, please give the vice-chairman one more chance...”\nContrary to their hopes, Chun Yeowun’s question was.\n“Can you assure that the man who revolted against me once will not rebel again?”\n“Ah...”\nThe two couldn’t answer and felt bad.\nChun Yeowun placed his palm on Wang Shin’s head.\n“I will kill you.”\n“I thank the Lord for punishing me. Lord Chun Ma, please bring life back to the Cult.”\nWang Shin closed his eyes with a sad face.\nChun Yeowun’s hand sent a tremor to the man.\nPuht!\n“Ugh1”\nSrrr!\nBlood dripped from Wang Shin’s forehead.\nGo Wang-hyeon and Sub-hyung, who watched it, looked bitter.\nChun Yeowun reached out somewhere.\n“Kyaal!”\nA woman’s scream was heard.\nThud!\nShe was the waitress who tried to manipulate the memory.\nShe was still grabbing her chest as she looked at Chun Yeowun in terror.\n“S-save me. Please... ach!”\nHer body kept convulsing. She was unable to think and kept coughing up blood.\n“Ack!”\nGo Wang-hyeon and Sub-hyung were curious.\nChun Yeowun didn’t move his fingers towards her, but the woman kept showing abnormal signs.\nThey weren’t sure what was happening to her.\nChun Yeowun pretended to lower something towards her.\nAnd.\nSlash!\nA sharp sound arose around her, and sword marks appeared on the floor.\nJjjkkkk!\n“Achhh!”\n“T-the floor!”\nThe floor, which was filled with sword marks and slashes, was cracking.\nA sword that seemed like it could cut down anything in front of it.\nGo Wang-hyeon and Sub-hyung were shocked.\n“Invisible Sword? No, this is...”\nIt was different from an invisible sword.\n“No... H-heart Sword!”\n“What?”\nAt those words, Ko Wang-hyeon couldn’t stop his eyes from widening.\nHeart Sword.\nIt literally meant to control a sword through the will of the heart.\nOnly a warrior at the Heavenly Master level could unfold it as the sword isn’t controlled by internal energy.\nTheir bodies trembled.\n‘To see the Heart Sword!’\nThe greatest honour for a warrior.\nChun Yeowun raised his hand and said.\n“I drew the sword, so don’t act afraid, you wench.”\n“Uh... uh...?”\nHer eyes widened.\nUntil a moment ago, she couldn’t even rise up, but now she felt like her heart was going to explode.\n“Wench.”\n“Yes... yes?”\nShe answered Chun Yeowun’s call.\n“You can manipulate memories?”\n“Ah-yes.”\n“Good. Then change his memories as I tell you.”\n“Huh?”\nHe pointed to Wang Shin.\nStill hanging by the wall with his body drooping.\nKo Wang-hyeon was startled and looked at Wang Shin.\n‘He didn’t kill him?’\nBlood was oozing out, so they thought that he was dead.\nAnd when they listened closely, they heard the faint sound of breathing.\n“Ah!”\nHe was alive.\nChun Yeowun didn’t kill him.\n“Move.”\n“Yes!”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, both of them, who were standing near Wang Shin, moved away.\nThe woman cautiously approached Wang Shin.\n‘To do such a thing. Ugh, this person...’\nKo Wang-hyeon was shocked.\nHe never thought that Chun Yeowun would use the woman who hurt him.\nThe female asked.\n“H-how should I change it?”\n“His loyalty should be towards me. He also must reflect deeply on this incident so that he is determined to make sacrifices for the Cult but not through death.”\nSurprisingly, Chun Yeowun didn’t change much.\nOnce it was done, Wang Shin wouldn’t insist on dying.\nIt was a wise move, so Go Wang-hyeon and Sub-hyung were happy.\nTak!\nThe woman put her hand on his head.\nWhite light rose from her hand and soon moved to Wang Shin’s head.\nTak!\nShe immediately released her hand, which caught Chun Yeowun’s interest.\n‘Very quick.’\nMemories seemed to have been changed by just touching the head for a brief moment.\n“Is it done?”\nShe nodded and answered.\n“Yes.”\n“You seem to be quite talented.”\n‘Ah!’\nThe woman’s eyes twinkled.\nUntil a second back, she thought she would be killed, but now, it seemed like she had a chance to live.\n‘I need to make myself look good.’\nShe had used her power to draw the attention of Chun Yu-seong when he visited the prison.\nAnd the ability to manipulate the memory was a very useful one.\nJudging by the situation, she fell to the ground.\n“Please spare me! I will promise to use my powers only for you.”\n“Use your powers for me?”\n“Y-yes!”\nKo Wang-hyeon helped her.\n“Her powers are really useful. Just a brief touch can change the memories.”\nThat was why Chun Yu-seong hired her.\nAlthough it wasn’t written down in the Sky Demon Order reconstruction plan, he planned to use the woman to brainwash every person in the Murim Association and the government.\n“It is quite useful.”\nShe became brighter.\n“I can make anyone you want obey you.”\nAt those words, Chun Yeowun narrowed his eyes.\n“You can make anyone you want not obey me too.”\n“Sorry?”\n“If you can change the memory with a brief touch, then you can manage to make many people be on your side, right?”\nChun Yeowun’s words made her anxious.\nConfused, she waved her hands and said.\n“I will swear allegiance to you! So how can I even think about doing that without your command? I will definitely not!”\n“Really? Then, why did the government have to keep such a loyal person in a secret prison?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, her complexion turned pale.\n“No! Believe me! T-that was because of a misunderstanding. They didn’t...”\nChak!\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun’s hand waved at her neck.\n“Kuak!”\nA red line appeared on it.\nAs her eyes looked shocked while her body fell, Chun Yeowun spoke coldly.\n“Believe you?”",

      "content": "“Master. Can I eat all of this?”\nChun Yeowun shook his head as he looked at Shakena, who was flicking her purple hair aside and showing a charming expression.\nShe was looking at the corpses on the floor like it was a dinner party.\n‘The energy rose.’\nThe unique energy which he sensed in her rose.\nIt was the energy that demons had and even the Murim warriors couldn’t notice it. However, Chun Yeowun, who could feel the energy flow in nature, was able to recognize it.\n‘She can be more useful.’\nThe stronger she got, the more effective she would become.\nHowever, since the day she crossed the Gate, she was caught and kept chained.\n“Eat it. No exceptions.”\n“Woah!”\nShe smiled brightly and tried to hug Chun Yeowun. But he pushed her away as if she was a bother.\n“Don’t push me.”\nIt was embarrassing, but Shakena chucked.\nThe colder he seemed, the stronger she felt the affinity of Chun Yeowun with her.\nWatching her devour the hearts of corpses, Yu So-hwa mumbled.\n“Crazy bitch.”\nShakena looked back at her and asked.\n“Want one?”\n“You... euk have it.”\nYu So-hwa hurriedly left the place.\nAt Chun Yeowun’s orders, he tried to let it be, but seeing Shakena rip the hearts of his colleagues and eat them, Ko Wang-hyeon sent a telepathic message.\n[L-Lord Chun Ma. Even if they were sinners, they were still members of the Cult. For their bodies to be like thi...]\nSaying it out loud could have been dangerous, so he sent his opinion through telepathy.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun wasn’t bothered by it.\n“Aren’t we supposed to dispose of the bodies?”\n“Yes, that is true.”\n“So? You want to hold a funeral and act all polite?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, Ko Wang-hyeon closed his mouth with a sad expression.\nThe bodies had to be disposed of. It had to be done either with acid or burned in fire.\n‘... I’m sorry.’\nBecause they broke the law and committed a sin, he couldn’t save them, so he prayed for them.\nOn the other hand, Sub-hyung was puzzled as he stared at the human eating the hearts.\nRaw.\n“Lord Chun Ma. That secretary... is she even human?”\nNo human would do such a thing.\nChun Yeowun said with an uninterested expression.\n“A demon.”\n“Yes?”\n“You might understand if I say that she is a Special type entity from the Gate?”\n‘!?’\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, Ko Wang-hyeon and Sub-hyung’s faces went stiff.\nIf it was a special type Gate entity, then it meant she had to be higher than A-class.\nA total chaos bringer\nThey did think that her behaviour was non-human.\n[My Lord. How could you, such a dangerous being?]\nAt Ko Wang-hyeon’s concern, Chun Yeowun uttered.\n“A slave, so don’t worry.”\nHonestly, she wasn’t dangerous. Since Chun Yeowun managed to subdue her easily, he was probably the most dangerous existence for the people of this era.\nAnd at his words, they backed down.\n“Understood.”\nIt took around 40 minutes for Shakena to eat all the bodies.\nApart from the brutality, she looked like a glutton.\nShe ate every single part, leaving behind only the bloodstains on the ground.\nShe chewed a few times and then swallowed. However, despite eating so much, she didn’t seem like she was full.\n‘Really not a human.’\nSeeing her like that, Yu So-hwa’s expression crinkled.\n“Ahh, I am full. Are there any sweet things?”\nShe looked just like a woman, except for her lips and dress that were stained in blood.\n‘Food changes into energy right after eating it.’\nChun Yeowun was interested in her.\nHer digestion system was intriguing.\nIt seemed to immediately break down the food and convert it into energy.\n‘Hmm.’\nIf the energy she had a while back was 100, then what she had now was 130.\nAnd this was the result of eating the bodies of 39 masters, most of which were at the Super Master level.\nHaving so many to eat was very rare for her.\n‘I am curious about the traitor.’\nAnother entity had appeared 15 years ago.\nIf that traitor demon was still alive, it meant that it had developed strength for a long time.\nTak!\nFrom the ceiling, Sub-hyung poured down the barrel of oil.\nInside the building, the smell could be perceived.\n“It’s done.”\n“The oil is poured on top.”\nThe bodies were disposed of, but they had to remove all the useless traces too.\nWheik!\nWhen Chun Yeowun set off the Flame qi, fire spread throughout the building.\nIt was fortunate that the restaurant was away from the city.\nEven with the fire, which was close to an arson level, no one would notice.\n“Hmm?”\nChun Yeowun, who was looking at the fire spreading all around the building, suddenly looked back.\nKo Wang-hyeon asked.\n“What is it?”\n“Are they coming late?”\n“Sorry?”\nIt was then.\nThe place was so out of town that there were no lights on the road, so everything was in darkness, but someone was approaching them at high speed.\nAnd they soon arrived.\nA man wearing a mask with a strange pattern and a sword on his back with another middle-aged man with a tall build and short flame-like hair.\n“Great Guardian! Left Guardian!”\nThey were Guardians like Sub-hyung, so he recognized them right away.\nThe one called Left Guardian was Lee Jong-hwa.\nHe looked at the burning restaurant and asked.\n“Right Guardian. What the hell happened here?”\nIt was natural for Lee Jong-hwa to react as such. They were on their way here as they heard that a notary guest would arrive.\nHowever, despite coming in haste, they only saw the place burn down.\n“And why is vice-chairman Wang Shin like this?”\nWang Shin was on the floor, with signs of injuries all over his body.\nSub-hyung stuttered.\n“There... was a problem.”\n“Problem?”\nSub-hyung answered with a slightly sad face.\n“Both chairman Chun Yu-seong and the other clan leaders broke the Cult law and plotted rebellion.”\n“What are you spewing? Rebellion?”\nSub-hyung’s words made Lee Jong-hwa frown.\nSub-hyung thought that he would recognize the identity of Chun Yeowun right away, but seeing his reaction, it seemed like he had no idea who Chun Yeowun was.\n‘Come to think of it!’\nNo one told him about Chun Ma.\nAt that time, the Great Guardian Marayun, who was wearing the mask, spoke to Chun Yeowun in a cautious tone.\n“Who might you be?”\nHis voice filled with energy.\nLee Jong-hwa was shocked.\nThe Great Guardian would never take such a stance even when in front of an enemy.\nBut now he was.\n“How interesting.”\nOn the other hand, Chun Yeowun looked at Marayun with quite the interest in his eyes.\nStartle!\nNoticing his gaze, Marayun ended up opening a distance of ten steps between him and Chun Yeowun.\nAnd shouted to Lee Jong-hwa.\n“Away!”\nUnexpectedly, Lee Jong-hwa’s body moved at the shout and spread the distance.\nMarayun seemed nervous.\nThe man in front of his eyes definitely possessed extraordinary abilities he couldn’t handle.\nThe man looked like an abyss.\n“Great Guardian he...”\nSh!\n“Um!”\nKo Wang-hyeon tried to reveal the identity of Chun Yeowun to stop them from acting rude towards him, but Chun Yeowun gestured at him to stay silent.\nAnd looked at the Right Guardian.\n[Stay silent for a moment.]\nChun Yeowun turned away.\nThey couldn’t understand what he was planning.\nChun Yeowun looked at Marayun,\n“You seem quite sensitive to your surroundings.”\n“Who are you?”\nMarayun wanted to know the man’s identity.\nConsidering the strength he felt and the cautious attitude of Ko Wang-hyeon and Sub-hyun behind, this man had to be here for the inauguration or notary.\n[Notary?]\n[When both Guardians come, you will find out.]\nChairman Chun Yu-seong didn’t give out the name till the end, so he couldn’t guess.\n‘Bloodline?’\nThe most influential would be the bloodline of the Lord’s family.\nHowever, he knew the faces of all of them.\n‘Who the hell could he be?’\nThat was when Chun Yeowun’s form scattered.\n‘No!’\nMarayun moved.\nTo be precise, his upper body moved back.\n“You are pretty good.”\nA hand holding a sword went past his body, which was now leaned back.\nChun Yeowun smiled.\nHe was testing Marayun without even giving out his name.\nIt was flustering and confusing for Marayun, who knew nothing about the situation.\n“But this posture is...”\nShh!\nChun Yeowun tried to lower his hand.\nWheik\n!\nMarayun, who was tilted back, leaned a little more to the back, and tried to kick Chun Yeowun.\nChun Yeowun titled his body lightly and avoided getting hit.\nPath!\nTaking advantage of it, Marayun opened the distance once again.\nThen, he took off the necklace he was wearing and opened the lid.\n‘Steps of the Wind God!’\nMarayun waved his hand, creating swords in the air.\nSeven sharp swords.\nSwoosh!\nSeven swords flew in the air and moved at his will, rushing towards Chun Yeowun.\n“Air Swords!”\nKo Wang-hyeon who watched that was shocked.\nHe knew that Marayun was, along with the Lord, the best in the current Cult. They were unmatched.\nHowever, he never thought that Marayun could do this.\n‘Air Sword is possible only when one is a Supreme Master.’\nAs Shocking as it was, Great Guardian Marayun was a Supreme Master.\nThere were only five strongest warriors in the current Murim who could do that.\nIt seemed like this one stayed hidden.\n‘Seven swords?’\nThat meant he wasn’t at the beginning of the Supreme Master, but at the end.\nSwoosh!\nThe Air Swords lined up around Chun Yeowun.\nAll tips pointed at him to kill him.\n“I have the upper hand. Please stop this and reveal yourself.”\nMarayun wiggled his fingers, the swords ready to pierce at his will.\nHe had done his best.\nHowever, the opponent hadn’t even pulled out his sword.\nHe thought that even if the opponent was skilled, the distance between them was too much for him to attack.\n[Prepare, just in case.]\nHowever, Marayun was the careful kind, so he sent a message to Lee Jong-hwa.\nIn response, Lee Jong-hwa increased his energy and condensed it on his sword, ready to move any time.\nShhh!\nThe hot flames that appeared, seemed like they were ready to exorcise everything with his Crimson Flame Sword.\n“I told you that in this situation, my sword has the upper hand.”\n“Well. If you want to know my identity, try finding it out by force.”\nChun Yeowun tried to move his hand.\nNoticing the slight movement, Marayun quickly released the swords.\nSwoosh!\nAll seven swords rushed for Chun Yeowun at the same speed.\n“You brought this on yourse.... Uh?”\nMarayun’s eyes, which could be seen through the gap in the mask, shook.\nThe swords, which were heading towards Chun Yeowun, stopped before hitting him.\nShocked, he ended up using more energy to control them.\nBut.\nTremble!\nThe swords, which were stopped mid-air, only trembled but couldn’t move.\nKikiki!\nSoon, the swords turned in the opposite direction.\nChun Yeowun slightly stretched out his hand towards Marayun.\nSwoosh!\nHaving escaped his control, Seven swords went for Marayun.\n‘H-he eroded my control?’\nMarayun couldn’t help but be shocked.\nIn a short span of time, the opponent managed to take control over his Air Swords.\n“Haaa!”\nJudging that Marayun was in danger, Lee Jong-hwa charged at Chun yeowun.\nHweik!\nFlames soared from his sword.\nBlazing bright, the sword drew a hot trajectory and rushed for the opponent.\n[Great Guardian! Get away!]\nHis sword moved for the purpose of helping Marayun.\nThose who used the Air Swords had to control them, so they wouldn’t be able to change to close combat.\nAnd if they decided to move their body, their control over the Air Swords would shatter.\nBut.\nPak!\n“Ugh!”\nLee Jong-hwa couldn’t hide his shock.\nChun Yeowun suddenly put his hand in the path of the trajectory, which was the first formation of the Crimson Flame Swordsmanship.\nHe grabbed the sword with two fingers.\n“H-how?”\nEven more shocking was that his sword, which was covered in flames, didn’t seem to have affected the opponent.\n‘Does that mean he can handle Flame qi? Then!’\nHe increased the Crimson Flame energy to the maximum.\nWheik!\nThe flames on the sword blazed even more.\nIt was to push the sword further in and cut off the arm. But Chun Yeowun seemed calm all throughout.\n‘T-this one...’\nChun Yeowun said.\n“Can you even call this hot?”\n“What?”\nAt that moment, the sword Chun Yeowun grabbed turned hotter.\nThe eyes of the swordsman widened.\nJiiii!\n“Euk!”\nLee Jong-hwa, unable to stand the heat, let go of the sword.\nHis palms were burnt black.\n‘A Flame qi which surpasses mine?’\nHe wasn’t called the Fire King for nothing!\n“Great Guardian.”\nShocked, he widened the distance and looked at Marayun.\nDespite getting the sword stolen by the opponent, he thought he bought enough time for the Great Guardian to escape.\n“No way!”\nThe seven swords seemed to have reached Marayun’s body, the swords had blood on them, and the body was gashed.\nCold sweat was running down the mask. A little further and the sword would have dug into his flesh.\n“W-who are you?”\nA level of mastery they had never seen.\nChun Yeowun flicked the sword he was holding.\n“Take this.”\nWheik! Pak!\n“Huh!”\nThe sword went exactly where Lee Jong-hwa was and struck the ground.\nThe ground turned red from the heat.\nChun Yeowun reached out to the swords aiming at Marayun, and the seven swords that lost contact fell to the ground.\nThud! Thud! Thud!\nAs they stood stunned, Chun Yeowun said.\n“This is surprising. I thought everyone was regressing, but did the Guardians actually surpass their predecessors?”\n‘!!!’\nAt those words, Marayun’s eyes widened. He immediately ran to Chun Yeowun and bowed.\n“Great Guardian, what are you doing?”\nLee Jong-hwa still couldn’t understand, but Marayun didn’t care.\n“Great Guardian Marayun, greets the 24th Lord of the Great Sky Demon Order, Lord Chun Ma.”\n‘Huh?’\nChun Yeowun’s eyes lit up.\nWhen he came here, everyone had to see the Sky Demon Sword, but this man accepted his existence right away.\nHe was about to ask out of curiosity, but Marayun said something unexpected.\n“Please punish me! For not waiting for Lord Chun Ma to appear again! For forsaking what the predecessors have built!”",

      "content": "Chapter 78: Keep it Hidden (2)\n[Keep in mind. He will surely return. The day when the Demon God comes… will be the day the Sky Demon Order will rise again.]\nThe last will of the past Great Guardian.\nThis will was kept in his heart for over 30 years.\nNo one knew about this other than the Great Guardian and a few more clans.\nShh!\nMarayun looked at Chun Yeowun standing in front of him.\nNo one ever overpowered him, but Chun Yeowun was too fast for him.\nHowever, the two had one similarity.\n‘He learned Steps of the Wind God.’\nSteps of the Wind God was the best light footwork method in the Sky Demon Order.\nAnd it was spread down to those with the title of Great Guardian.\n‘I heard that the 2nd Chun Ma knew most of the martial arts which existed in the Cult. That legend has to be true.’\nEven during the reign of Chun Yeowun, only a few knew of that.\nAfter walking away from the burning restaurant, Chun Yeowun stopped.\nTak!\nMarayun stopped.\nChun Yeowun said.\n“Speak.”\nChun Yeowun changed the place at the request of Marayun, who asked for a conversation.\nOthers moved away to erase any trace left behind near the restaurant.\nPak!\nMarayun fell flat on the ground.\nChun Yeowun waved his hand.\n“Omit the unneeded formalities.”\nChun Yeowun only wondered about what Marayun said and how he recognized him.\nAll the members of the clans, even those of the Chun family, couldn’t recognize him.\nWho could even accept that the 2nd Chun Ma who disappeared one thousand years ago has come back?\n“Haaa…”\n“Enough.”\n“Understood.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s absolute words, Marayun knelt.\nAnd Chun Yeowun asked.\n“How did you know it was me?”\n“I was ignorant and didn’t recognize you right away…”\n“Don’t sweat it.”\nMarayun, who took a moment to breathe, continued.\n“… the Great Guardian family shares down the secrets of the Lords. As Guardians, and holders of Order in the Cult.”\n“I know that.”\nIt happened during the time of Marakim too, the Great Guardian during Chun Yeowun’s era.\nHe was a shadow to the Lord. The Lord’s alter ego.\n“A thousand years ago. After the sudden disappearance of the Chun Ma, the Cult was in chaos.”\nNatural outcome.\nThe Lord was missing. It was bound to happen.\nConfusion rose\nChun Yeowun’s eyes grew heavy at that.\n“At our Cult, and everywhere else, the entire Jianghu was searched to find Chun Ma. Years and years, but nothing was found out.”\nThe disappearance of the Lord of the Cult, who created the best era for the Sky Demon Order since the first Chun Ma.\nBecause of that, Cult members couldn’t stop worrying and crying.\n“That is what is known to all.”\nThere is always another version.\nAnd that was a secret that Great Guardians kept inheriting as information.\n“After the disappearance of Chun Ma, Seong Mu-chun, who was a warrior in the Cult, made a prophecy.”\n“Seong Mu-chun.”\nChun Yeowun frowned. It was his first time hearing that name.\nMarayun continued.\n“What I know is that he was a talented person selected by Lord Chun ma in the Liaoning province.”\n“Me?”\nChun Yeowun had no memory of him choosing someone from Liaoning province.\nChun yeowun’s eyes pondered at the thought of who he was.\n‘Seong Mu-chun… Seong Mu-chun… wait! Is it Chun Mu-seong?’\nThe descendant from the distant future.\nThe name written backwards.\nHe couldn’t return to his original time period, and Chun Yeowun rescued him from the TP who came for him and even taught him martial arts.\n‘Did he stay in the Cult for a while?’\nChun Yeowun thought that the man would have gone back to his time once he disappeared.\n“He made a prophecy?”\n“Yes.”\nThe descendant was reluctant to talk about the future.\nProphecy meant he said information about the future.\nBut the time axis had changed, so how could he tell?\n“And what was that prophecy?”\n“It was said that Chun Ma attained enlightenment by fighting someone and went to the realm of heaven, and once a thousand years pass, he will return back to the present time.”\n“He said I’d be back in a thousand years?”\nChun Yeowun’s eyes narrowed.\nEven if the descendant came from the future, the time axis had changed, so it was questionable how he found Chun Yeowun’s whereabouts.\nThat was when Chun Yeowun remembered one thing.\n‘AH!’\nChun Mu-seong had a tracker.\nThe tracker was made of Gatelinium metal which the Nano chip was made of. And that was in Chun Yeowun’s body.\n‘So that’s how he found out.’\nIn order to find where he was, Chun Mu-seong must have used the terminal. But the location was a thousand years in the future, so he must have been confused.\n“Ha!”\nChun Yeowun exclaimed.\nKnowing that, he felt like the descendant did something good.\nIt would be impossible for the descendant to announce something like that.\n[Hello, I am a time traveller from the future. Ancestor has travelled to the future.]\nNo one of the past would have believed that.\nSo he spoke in a way the people of that era could understand.\n“You and the Lord are the only ones who know of this?”\n“Yes.”\nGreat Guardians, who firmly believed that, made it known to the following generations.\nMarayun, who came to power, knew about Chun Yeowun, his skills, and his appearance. So he was able to identify Chun Yeowun the moment he saw him take control of the Air Swords and use Flame qi much stronger than the Left Guardian’s.\n“I am sorry for not recognizing you right away.”\nHe would have noticed Chun Yeowun sooner if it wasn’t for the suit and the cut hair.\nEven then, who could have ever recognized a person based on an oral description?\nAs Marayun was feeling guilty, Chun Yeowun said.\n“Sorry…”\n“Even though it was passed down with each generation, you all continued to be loyal to me and never forgot about me. Do you think I will blame you for that?”\n“Lord Chun Ma!”\nPak!\nMarayun lowered his head, feeling emotional.\nIt was an honour to be told such soft words by Chun Ma, who had descended onto the current time.\nThud!\nMarayun apologized by hitting his head hard enough to crack the mask.\n“I have sinned! I wasn’t able to maintain the will of the Cult the way my predecessors did.”\n“You keep saying will this and will that, but what the hell is the will you keep talking about?”\n“I thought that the Chun Ma had crossed over into the sacred realm.”\n“What?”\nPeople of the Sky Demon use the expression of sacred realm when the Lord dies.\nIt was meant to say that one was dead.\n‘Hmm.’\nChun Mu-seong claimed to be a prophet and said that Chun yeowun would return back in a thousand years, but he didn’t give the exact time.\n‘Why did he do that?’\nIt was questionable, but there was no way to confirm it as he was too far from them now.\nChun Yeowun asked Marayun, who was bowing his head.\n“Why did you think I was dead?”\n“That…”\nMarayun hesitated.\n“Go on.”\n“It was because of the remains and relics of Chun Ma that Chun Woo-kyung, the younger brother of the current Lord, had discovered.”\n“What?”\nChun Yeowun’s eyebrows rose.\n“Please punish me!”\nThud!\nMarayun banged his head.\nHe was hidden behind the mask, but his face was crossed with shame and guilt.\nChun Yeowun clicked his tongue.\n“For a man like you to be played by him.Tch.”\n“I am sorry!”\n“Tell me in detail what happened.”\n10 days ago.\nAs he wandered around to check the secret prison looking for the Lord of the Sky Demon Order, he sensed something.\nDuring his 27 years of sincerity, the Sky Demon Order didn’t come out of dissolving.\nAll the Cult members were aware of the factions war.\n“The Lord didn’t place anyone on the seat, and as Guardians, we couldn’t just point to anyone and take a side.”\nHowever, the Guardians couldn’t just stand still.\nIf left as it was, it looked like the faction war would never end, and the Cult would only be completely destroyed.\n“Unfortunately, I thought that we needed a new Lord.”\nAs the Great Guardian, he did have the authority to appoint a new Lord when a crisis struck.\n“However, we couldn’t have an unqualified person become the Lord.”\nMarayun decided to see the two factions in person and then decide.\n“Two?”\n“Chun Yu-seong and Chun Yu-jang.”\nNot three, but two.\nFrom Marayun’s standpoint, who served the current Lord, it wasn’t right to appoint Chun Woo-kyung, the younger brother of the Lord, as the new Lord.\nIt was because he was already pushed away from the competition in the past.\nTherefore, Marayun planned to select the most suitable person among the Lord’s kids.\n“But I was wrong.”\nThe first person Marayun went for was Chun Woo-kyung.\n“Why did you go to him?”\n“It was to tell that one of the two kids will be the Lord.”\nTo declare the purpose.\nBesides, he requested Chun Woo-kyung to help in the unification of the Cult by guiding the new Lord.\n“How stupid.”\nChun Yeowun shook his head, and Marayun was embarrassed.\n“I took Chun Woo-kyung too lightly.”\nHe thought that Chun Woo-kyung would at least understand his reasons.\nHowever, the visit provided an opportunity for Chun Woo-kyung.\nOnce Marayun revealed his intentions to the man...\n“Chun Woo-kyung told me that he found the remains and weapons of Chun Ma.”\nMarayun was genuinely shocked.\nThat was dangerous news for the Great Guardian, who was waiting for Chun Yeowun to actually appear.\n“I thought that the man’s prophecy was wrong.”\nMarayun believed the prophecy till the end.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun who disappeared, only his remains were found after a thousand years.\nAlthough he didn’t say it, that night, Marayun had wept.\n“So, did he say that he would be the new Lord and the Chun Ma?”\n“It wasn’t that.”\nDirector Chun Woo-kyung was an evil person.\nHe never revealed his true intentions because he knew that the Great Guardian was better in martial arts.\n“Rather, that time, when the Sky Demon Sword appeared, someone said that a new Chun Ma needed to be created to re-establish the Sky Demon Order.”\nChun Woo-kyung never put himself first.\nRather, he even suggested to the Great Guardian to pick someone who was better qualified among the kids.\nAt that time, Marayun just accepted the words.\nHe, who was weakened with the constant war in factions, truly believed in the words of Chun Woo-kyung.\n“… then I told him about it.”\n“About what?”\n“That…”\nMount Hangbaek, southeast of Huangshi city.\nAlthough it was located inside the city, it was close to the wall, making people less visible.\nThe mountain wasn’t too steep, but once entered, people could see why it is called Hangbaek.\nFrozen cliffs.\nIt had a winter-like appearance all around the year.\nDrrr!\nAs people weren't around, one didn’t know, but the icicles were shaking strong enough to fall.\nIt was an artificial vibration and not an earthquake.\nAt the innermost foot of the mountain, there was a place where the inside was covered with darkness.\nNumerous lanterns were lit in the place where light would never come, and many workers in uniforms were dragging the icicles out of the cave.\n“It's not there. More ice over there!”\n“Yes!”\nAt someone’s call, the others moved the cart.\nBarracks of tents were encamped 200 meters away from the ice mining site.\nAnd in one tent.\nTap! Tap!\nA middle-aged man was nervously tapping the table inside the tent.\nThe man in grey padding was Chun Woo-kyung.\nThere was an old phone on the table, and he looked at it with irritated eyes.\n‘Damn bastard!’\nHe sent an A-class core as payment. However, no progress has been relayed.\n‘Why is he not contacting me?’\nBy now, he should have mentioned if the assassination was successful or not.\nHowever, contact was completely lost.\nChun Woo-kyung got up from his seat and pulled out a cigarette.\nChik!\nAs soon as he lit the fire, he took a deep breath and then exhaled.\n‘Great. I didn’t expect much from them either.’\nPush!\nAs he walked to the tent entrance, he looked at the place where the ice was being mined.\n‘If only I can get the legacy of Chun Ma!’\nInside the cave lies the legacy left behind by the 24th Lord.\nIt wasn’t something like the Sky Demon Sword.\nIf the legend he knew was true, then it was the source of the Demon God’s power.\n‘I should have coaxed the Great Guardian a bit more.’\nIn order to avoid suspicion as much as possible, only one place where the legacy was held was obtained.\nHe tried to hurry, but with ice settled in, it was hard to see any result despite the best equipment being used.\n‘It will be in my hands soon. I need to finish this work quickly…’\nIt was then. Shouts came from outside.\nWoong!\nThe sound was muffled, making it hard to understand.\nBut one thing he knew was, it had to be found!\nPhat!\nChun Woo-kyung rushed down to the cave with anticipating eyes.\nWhen he arrived, he saw someone shouting loudly.\n“Lord Chun Ma!”\nPak!\nWhen the person saw Chun Woo-kyung, he bowed down and greeted him.\nThe man was wearing the same winter clothes as the workers. He was a supporter of the Chun Woo-kyung faction.\nAlthough the video had broken out, he still believed that Chun Woo-kyung was the real one.\n“Did you find it?”\nChun Woo-kyung asked.\n“That… you will have to head down there and see.”\n“What happened?”\n“While moving the ice…”\nIt was then.\nKwaang!\nA huge roar from inside.\nThe moment they heard it, the cave shook too. This time, it was like an earthquake.\n“Earthquake!”\n“E-everyone out of the cave!”\nThinking the cave would collapse, the workers rushed outside. Ha Woo-chan, his supporter, spoke in a bewildered voice.\n“There are several leaders inside!”\nPhat!\nHa Woo-chan hurried into the cave.\n“Ha Woo-chan!!”\nIt wasn’t just the workers, but the supporters of Chun Woo-kyung, who were down here as regular workers, could get hurt during this work.\nDrrrr!\nChun Woo-kyung looked at the shaking cave.\nWorkers ran out, trembling in fear of dying.\nIt seemed like something was going on inside.\n“Shit.”\nThinking, Chun Woo-kyung opened his eyes wide and looked at the cave.\nAs work continued for days, the cave was quite deep. Around 300 meters.\nJjjj!\n“Uhm!”\nA tremendous amount of heat was coming from inside the cave, enough to burn everyone.\n‘What the hell is this?’\nWheik!\nChun Woo-kyung noticed that flame was flickering inside the cave. But he wasn’t sure what it was.\nTo be as careful as possible, they didn’t even bring any explosives into the cave, which was why it seemed more strange.\nIt was then.\n“Kuaaak!”\nScreams came from within the cave.\nChun Woo-kyung hurried inside only to see a huge cavity.\nWheik!\nThe cave was overflowing with flames, flames which looked like hell.\n“This!”\nChun Woo-kyung raised his internal energy to protect himself.\nSomething screamed inside and ran towards him.\n“Kuaaak! S-save me!”\nIt was Ha Woo-chan who went into the cave to save others.\nHe was naked with his skin burning.\nWheik!\nBehind him, huge flames seemed to be coming to life.\nFlames that moved like they had life in them.\n“Kuaaak!”\n“Euk!”\nChun Woo-kyung covered his ears.\nThe screams from the flame couldn’t be stopped.\nHa Woo-chan, who reached him, said covering his ears.\n“L-Lord Chun Ma! We must run away!”\nIt was then.\n“Chun Ma?”\nA puzzled voice, the flame which wanted to burn everything subsided.\nStep! Step!\nAn unknown person whose body was covered in flames stepped forward.\nThe flames wrapped around the body vanished, revealing the person.\n‘A human?’\nA naked man with long red hair like the flame, every hair on the body was red.\nGoo!\nThe flame disappeared, but the naked man was giving out energy like a ferocious storm.\nThud!\nThe man got down on his knees and opened his mouth.\n“Chun Ma…. Chun Ma… my… My Lord.”\nDrrr!\nThe entire body trembled.\nChun Woo-kyung smiled at the excitement he felt.\n‘This… this is the legacy of the Demon God!’",

      "content": "Chapter 79: Legacy of Demon God (1)\nChun Woo-kyung couldn’t hide his satisfaction as he looked at the man sitting in front of him.\nHe was a bit slurred and lacked awareness, but his power was so strong that it was no exaggeration to call him a walking war machine.\nClank! Clank!\nEven in the cold, the red-haired man with only pants on his body, was seated on the cold floor and was eating the stockpiled food.\nRavenously, he put food into his mouth with his bare hands, as if he was trying to fill the starving stomach.\n‘He already ate half of the food!’\n‘Is he the God of Gluttony?’\nThe amount of food the red-haired man ate was the share of 86 people.\nWatching that, the people of the Chun Woo-kyung faction were dumbfounded.\n“Lord Chun Ma. If you leave him like that…”\n“Doesn’t matter. We can just get more food.”\nMore important was the condition of the man.\nThe monster who knelt in front of Chun Woo-kyung and then collapsed.\nStaying in the ice seemed to drain him.\n[T-that monster… was trapped in ice.]\nHa Woo-chan’s words, who survived from the burns.\nHow the man got out, how he survived in ice, they were all full of questions about the man trapped in the ice prison.\nThe coldness of the ice was at -273.15°C. At a temperature where molecular movements would stop, this mysterious man was alive and moving.\n‘Maybe the secret to immortality is contained in that.’\nImmortality, the dream of mankind. Chun Woo-kyung began to turn greedy.\n“Hehhe! Delicious! More! Give me more! I want to eat more!”\nThe man who ate the whole pile of dried beef jerky spoke excitedly.\nHe ripped the rest of the canned food.\nThen, a middle-aged man entered the tent.\n“Leader.”\n“Lord Chun Ma.”\nA half-white, middle-aged man bowed.\n“Did you check it?”\n“Yes.”\nThe man was a neurosurgeon specializing in the brain.\nHe was playing the role of a doctor on this trip.\n“How was it?”\nIn response to Chun Woo-kyung’s question, he handed the tablet PC.\nThe tablet PC contained brain scans and other results.\n“You can see here! I don’t know how long he has been in here, but the brain cells have been damaged.”\n“Is that why he is like that?”\nChun Woo-kyung asked, looking at the man digging his hands into the canned food.\nThe man was more like a savage child.\n“It is because the nerve cells in the brain have been damaged, and he was left in that state for a long time in the cold, which is why he is displaying such degenerative behaviour.”\nChun Woo-kyung nodded his head.\nHe did make this rough guess, and this only helped him.\n“It is just the brain. The body is well and moving normally. Besides, he has fast regenerative power.”\n“Regenerative?”\n“The regeneration of cells is several times greater than that of a normal person. If there is a wound, he will heal real quick.”\nChun Woo-kyung was interested in the new piece of information.\nThe ability to rapidly regenerate without medical intervention might be the starting point to immortality.\n“With this rate of cell regeneration, it has potential to clear the degenerative behaviour syndrome, and might become normal in a month.”\n“Hmm.”\nChun Woo-kyung’s expression was weird, making the doctor ask.\n“Is there a problem?”\n“So the regenerative syndrome can stay if the brain cells are stopped from regenerating?”\n“Sorry?”\nAt Chun Woo-kyung’s words, the doctor was dumbfounded.\nThose were the words that any doctor would hate the most, to keep a patient suffering.\n“Why?”\nAt that question, Chun Woo-kyung licked his lips.\n“Cause this is the perfect condition.”\nHe wanted the power, not the man.\nSo he didn’t want his original memory to come back, which meant he didn’t want the syndrome to leave.\nMaking the man believe that he is Chun Ma, is all that he wanted.\n“Hehehe! I am full. Nice!”\nThe red-haired man ate for 120 minutes and was now satisfied as he pounded his belly.\nChun Woo-kyung approached him and asked.\n“Subordinate.”\n“Yes. My Lord!”\nChun Woo-kyung called him subordinate as he couldn’t know the name.\n“Are you all done now?”\n“Yes. Indeed, the Lord is the best!”\nThe others shook their heads.\nIf one ate all that and wasn’t full, then they wouldn’t be humans.\nChun Woo-kyung leaned closer and asked.\n“Subordinate. Do you remember what you said to me before you passed out?”\n“What words? Subordinate said nothing.”\n“Didn’t you say something inside the cave?”\n“Inside the cave?”\nThe man shook his head and then smiled brightly.\n“In the cave. It was very hot.”\n“Right! Then!”\nChun Woo-kyung waited for the next words with wide eyes.\nAt first, he thought that the man was a legacy of Demon God, but no.\nThe man said he was protecting something inside the cave before he fainted.\nAnd now that he woke up, he completely forgot it.\n“Guide me to where it is.”\n“Lord orders. I listen to Lord very well. Hehe.”\nThe man jumped up and tried to leave when Chun Woo-kyung caught him.\n“Put this on before we leave. I prepared this for you.”\nNo matter how great his resistance to cold was, he had to wear something.\nOn the table was a top and something like a mask in the form of a helmet.\nTinted goggles which could cover the face.\n“This is stuffy, lord.”\nPutting on the mask, he was about to take it off.\n“Always keep this on. This is an order from Chun Ma.”\n“Ugh.”\nAt that, the man nodded with a sullen face.\nChun Woo-kyung was trying to prevent the others from knowing the man’s face.\nIn particular, ‘that person’ shouldn’t recognize it.\n“Never take it off, okay?”\n“Okay.”\nAt first, he didn’t like the mask, but after a few times of constantly telling him not to take it off, he stopped complaining.\nAfter the preparations were done, Chun Woo-kyung tried to re-enter the cave.\nBut because of the degenerative syndrome, the movements of the subordinate were slurred and unsure.\nPhat!\n‘Amazing.’\nAs they moved slowly, the man suddenly moved so far, unfolding light footwork.\nLooking at the posture, it was definite he learned martial arts.\nDespite having degenerative behaviour syndrome, the man’s body seemed to remember everything.\nWhen they reached the middle of the cave, Chun Woo-kyung gave orders to the others.\n“You guys stay here.”\n“Yes!”\n“Do not let anyone come in.”\nA treasure which was the legacy of Demon God, was inside the cave.\nHe had no intention of sharing it with others.\n“Come on, Lord! A little further!”\n“Wait!”\nChun Woo-kyung ordered his men and went into the cave alone with the man.\nAnd not long after, they reached the place where he was first discovered.\nNow the flames were no more, just the ice.\n“Where is it?”\n“Over there. Lord.”\nHe ran somewhere, a place tightly closed by the ice.\n“Isn’t that blocked?”\n“I will break it, my Lord. You wait.”\n“Huh?”\nHe put his palms on the wall. Hot flames erupted from his hand, and the old ice wall began to melt.\n‘Indeed, he is amazing.’\nChun Woo-kyung couldn’t hide his satisfaction. As a master at the Superior master level, he couldn’t melt the ice with internal energy.\nThe strength of this man was too much, to break down an ice wall.\n‘The best power. Hahaha!’\nA subordinate like him was strong.\nHe thought that with this kind of power, he could even deal with Chun Ma.\nSplash!\n‘Water.’\nBefore long, the floor they were standing on was turning into water, revealing a space behind.\n“Ah!”\nChun Woo-kyung exclaimed at the sight.\nA hidden cave.\n“There.”\nThere was an altar where the man pointed.\nOn the altar was engraved the word DEMON in red , a symbol of the Sky Demon Order.\n“Hahahaha!”\nChun Woo-kyung ended up laughing aloud.\nThe legacy of the Demon God he had been searching for, was finally in front of his eyes.\nPhat!\nHe approached the altar at once.\nIt was hot.\nThere was something on it.\n“Is this made of sapphire?”\nThere were few things that could withstand heat for more than a thousand years.\nThis green colour vial had to be sapphire.\nChun Woo-kyung protected himself with energy and opened the bottle cap.\n“Haa!”\nA musty smell escaped from within.\nIt was the smell of blood.\nChun Woo-kyung couldn’t hide his emotions as he smiled.\n“Found it.”\nWhat he waited for for so long was inside the vial.\n“Blood of Flame Qilin!”\nThe red liquid inside must be the blood of Flame Qilin!\nThe power of one of the five spirit beasts and a rare treasure that could enhance the body with a single drop of blood.\n“Lord feels good. That is all I need.”\nThe man waved his hands with a smile.\nChun Woo-kyung said.\n“Subordinate. Get away and stand.”\n“Get away? What?”\n“It means not to touch me.”\nChun Woo-kyung was planning on drinking the blood.\n‘With this, I can attain immortality.’\nLegend has it that those who had the core of the spirit beasts or the blood will be immortal.\nIn addition, the spirit beasts contained a certain attribute so, if the Blood of Flame Qilin was taken, he could use flame.\n‘This is the source of this man’s power.’\nIf he drank it, then he would be the same as the red-haired man.\nChun Woo-kyung wanted to drink that quickly.\n“Hmm. How do I do that? Lord?”\nEverything was fine, except for this.\nHe has to explain every single thing.\nChun Woo-kyung sighed and pointed his finger at the cave.\n“Sigh… go to the entrance over there so no one can enter…”\nWheik!\nIt was then. The man suddenly turned his head and stared at the direction of the cave.\n“Why would you do that…”\nAckk!\nA scream from the cave.\n“What is that?”\nMembers and workers were guarding the path into the cave.\nSo what did the scream mean?\nIn a solemn voice, the subordinate said.\n“Someone is coming. Lord.”\n“Coming?”\n“Strong. Very strong.”\nAs soon as he said that, another scream followed.\nKuaK!\nKuak!\nContinuous screams.\nThey kept getting closer.\nChun Woo-kyung began to lose his happy face.\nIt looked like the enemy who invaded was indeed strong.\n‘Who?’\nThe only people who knew of this place were him and Marayun.\nEven if Marayun told the other two factions about this legacy of Demon God, it was impossible for them to come here so quickly.\nImpossible to move as their transport was on ground.\n‘Then at such times…’\nThe screams were getting closer and closer. It felt like no one was able to stop the intruder.\nChun Woo-kyung looked at the cave with a troubled face and looked at the vail.\n‘Blood of Flame Qilin!’\nHe can’t let someone else take it.\nHe lifted the bottle and drank it at once.\nGulp! Gulp!\nThe blood was as hot as boiling water. He felt his throat burn. Enduring the pain, he gulped every drop of it.\n“Kuaaa!”\nHis stomach was burning.\nThe blood of Flame Qilin was intense.\nPak!\nChun Woo-kyung, who gulped the blood, sat down.\nHe wasn’t sure how, but he wanted to absorb the power which was in the blood.\n“Subordinate. No one should touch me…”\n“He's here.”\n“What?”\nAt those words, Chun Woo-kyung’s eyes turned to the cave.\nThe long shadows of the cave walls.\nArrived.\nIt was true.\nStep! Step!\nSoon, the face of the intruder appeared.\nHe was.\n‘!!!’\nChun Woo-kyung’s eyes widened.\nIt was the most unexpected person.\n‘Chun-Chun Ma!’",

      "content": "Chapter 80: Legacy of Demon God (2)\n‘Ch-chun Ma!’\nThe man was different from what he had seen in the video.\nThe existence in the whole place itself turned intimidating.\n‘H-how is he here?’\nChun Woo-kyung couldn’t understand it.\nHe was sure that Chun Yeowun was in Jinan city.\nAnd in Jinan city, a Gate Warning was issued, so no transportation was operating.\nComing here should be utterly impossible.\nAt his bewilderment, Chun Yeowun spoke in a cynical voice.\n“It’s better if you don’t wait for that brain to find an answer.”\nFinally, he came face to face with the leader of the third faction.\nBecause this faction was like an organization, it wasn’t easy to find the members and trace the whereabouts of Chun Woo-kyung.\nBut he ended up finding it thanks to him aiming for the legacy.\n“Greed has made you get caught by the ankle.”\nChun Yeowun stretched out his hand.\nEnergy rose and pulled Chun Woo-kyung’s body.\n“Ugh?”\nThe red-haired man blocked it.\nWooh!\nWhen the man held out his hand, tremors occurred, and Chun Woo-kyung’s body, which was about to float, fell to the ground.\n“Hmm?”\nChun Yeowun’s eyes lit up.\n‘He stopped energy?’\nIt was the first time it happened since coming to this era.\nEven Superior Masters couldn’t do that here, which meant this one had to be exceptional.\nThe subordinate shouted at Chun Yeowun.\n“Lord. I won’t let him touch you! If you bully my Lord, I won’t forgive you!”\nThe moment he heard those words, Chun Yeowun’s eyes narrowed.\nA very familiar voice.\n‘No way…’\nThe voice was thicker than the one he knew, and the tone was slurred.\nA wording that children usually use.\nUnlike Chun Yeowun, who was puzzled, Chun Woo-kyung was surprised by the subordinate's act.\n‘He stopped the internal energy of Chun Ma?’\nHe didn’t think that he was this strong.\nA small ray of hope bloomed in his heart.\n‘If he can deal with him, then I may have a chance.’\nHe thought that there was a slight possibility of taking down the enemy while aiming for a gap.\nBut not everything goes as planned.\n“Kuak!”\nChun Woo-kyung coughed up blood.\nThe man started to panic at the sight and supported him.\n“Lord! Are you alright?”\n“I-I am fine.”\nEven speaking seemed difficult for Chun Woo-kyung.\nHis body was swelling up because of the blood he drank.\nHe said he was fine, but his insides were burning like fire.\n‘I need to stabilize…’\nIt was urgent to stabilize and control the energy movement in his body.\nIn the meantime, he hoped that the man could block Chun Ma.\n“Subordinate. Stop him, no, just kill him!”\nRather than stopping him, killing him would be the best outcome.\nBut the response from the man was different.\n“Lord. But that person. I feel like I saw him before.”\n‘!?’\nChun Woo-kyung frowned.\nIf this was the legacy of the Demon God, then it had to be passed down from a thousand years ago.\nThere was a possibility of the person being acquainted with the Demon God at one point.\n‘Even with the problem in his brain, he still remembers that man?’\nIt seemed similar to knowing martial arts.\nAccording to the doctor, it had to take a month for the degenerative behaviour syndrome to cure.\nBut Chun Woo-kyung couldn’t stop being nervous.\n‘I shouldn’t think of other stuff.’\nHe pointed to Chun Yeowun, who was at the entrance of the cave and spoke.\n“Listen up. That person is a wicked person who pretends to be the Chun Ma.”\n“Pretend?”\n“He calls himself Chun Ma.”\nAt those words, the subordinate’s ears went red. It was because he was angry at what he had just heard.\n“Chun Ma is my Lord!”\n‘Good.’\nHe achieved what he intended to.\nIf anger was brought out, the man wouldn’t think of anything other than smashing the man in front of him.\nChun Woo-kyung licked his lips.\n“That person is trying to kill me and confuse the Sky Demon Order. What should you do?”\nBang!\nThe subordinate slammed his hand on the floor.\n“He needs to be killed! I will kill him! No one will touch the Lord!”\nHe was angry.\nHis brain has degenerated, but he could feel anger.\nOn the other hand, Chun Yeowun’s eyes turned cold.\n“You are pulling strings till the end.”\nHe stretched out his hand.\nJjjjjkk!\nCold spread throughout the cave. Hundreds of Ice swords appeared.\nChun Woo-kyung was at a loss of words at that sight.\n“W-what is this?”\n“Then both of you die together!”\nChun Yeowun pointed his finger at them.\nAll the ice swords went rushing for Chun Woo-kyung.\nHe could have used Sky Flash, but they were in the cave, so he avoided doing that.\n“D-damn it!”\nShocked and scared, Chun Woo-kyung closed his eyes.\nWhen he was one step away from turning into a hedgehog.\nSomething he hadn’t expected happened.\nWheiik!\nFlames formed like a thick film around them.\nPapapak!\nThe ice swords which hit the shield made of flames, shattered or melted because of the heat.\nNot a single sword made it inside.\n“Oh-oh!”\nChun Woo-kyung was excited and amazed.\nHe didn’t think that it could be stopped.\n“My Lord! Do not bully my Lord!”\nThe man who blocked the Ice Swords, groaned and slammed his red palms to the ground.\n‘What is he trying to do?’\nBewildered, he raised his palms again.\nA pillar of fire rose where Chun Yeowun was standing.\nWheeik!\nThe pillar of flame engulfed Chun Yeowun in an instant. But that didn’t seem enough, so the man opened his hands, and dozens of spheres of flames were formed.\nDung!\nTemperature rising even more.\n“Die!!”\nThe sphere of white flames created in the air rushed towards the pillars like cannons.\nKwakwakwang!\nAs the sphere of flame entered the pillar of flame, an explosion occurred.\nThe destructive power was enough to shake the entire cave.\nRumble!\n‘A-amazing!’\nChun Woo-kyung couldn’t keep his mouth shut. He couldn’t hide his shock at the man who had tremendous power in his hands.\nHe didn’t seem like a human.\n‘This is the subordinate's strength.’\nThis man looked like he was overpowering Chun Ma.\nWithin the explosion which looked impossible for everyone to survive.\nWheeing!\nA huge spear of flame appeared in the subordinate’s hand.\nIt seemed like he was trying to be certain of his kill. It was the moment he was about to throw the spear of flame.\nSwoosh!\nSomething happened to the flame pillar.\nLike the Red Sea which split in half, Chun Yeowun’s extended hand was revealed.\n“You are pretty good.”\nChun Yeowun said casually.\nChun Yeowun was uninjured, not a single burn.\n‘…no!’\nChun Woo-kyung was startled.\n“Uh!”\nThe man was shocked too.\nHowever, he soon regained his posture and threw the spear of flame at Chun Yeowun.\nShhh!\nThe spear of flame tried to pierce Chun Yeowun’s heart.\nOf course, the subordinate thought he would avoid it, so he threw another spear at the same time towards where Chun Yeowun moved.\nBut.\nPak!\nChun Yeowun grabbed the spear of flame flying in.\nThere was a risk of getting burned, but Chun Yeowun threw the spear of flame back at the man as if nothing had happened.\n“Take it back.”\nShhh!\nFlames were his power, so he believed that no damage would happen to him.\n“Flames are useless to me…”\nPak!\n“Kuak!”\nHis expectations shattered.\nThe spear of flame pierced through the man’s shoulder.\nAnd with that, he bounced back.\nThud!\nAfter bouncing back a few times, the subordinate got up.\nThe pierced part was rapidly regenerating.\nShhhh!\nBlood vessels connecting and muscles reforming.\nSeveral times the speed of any normal regeneration.\nChun Yeowun, who saw it, said.\n“Indeed, it is you. You took the blood of Flame Qilin.”\nThe flame, and the regenerative abilities.\nChun Yeowun was suspicious of the man.\n‘Blood of flame Qilin couldn’t be taken by a human.’\nFlame wasn’t easy.\nIt contained energy which men couldn’t take, and without neutralizing the blood, the insides would burn, and the person would die.\n‘hmm.’\nThere was only one man who overcame that.\nThanks to the neutralizing of blood with Ice qi, the man who called himself the aide of Chun Yeowun, survived.\n‘Why?’\nChun Woo-kyung’s subordinate felt nostalgia.\nMore than a thousand years have passed.\nThe blood did extend the lifespan, but not to this extent.\n‘Then.’\nThe only way to dispel the doubt was to check it out for himself.\nIf he could check the face behind the mask, he would know for sure.\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun’s form dispersed and reached in front of the subordinate.\nMost people couldn’t have noticed it, but the subordinate raised his flames when Chun Yeowun closed the distance.\nWheeik!\nAfter Chun Yeowun dodged it, he reached for the mask.\n“Ahh!”\nShocked, the man moved back.\n[Never take off the mask.]\nHe remembered the command from Chun Woo-kyung, so he avoided it.\nBesides, Chun Woo-kyung, who was unable to concentrate on the energy flowing in his body, kept shouting.\n“Don’t take off the mask!!”\nThe man who heard it tried to run.\n“Where!”\nChun Yeowun followed him.\nThe man desperately tried to escape, but the same thing kept happening again and again.\nWhen he was on the verge of being caught, the man screamed.\n“Ahhhh!”\n“Show your face.”\nNot caring about the other person’s wishes, Chun Yeowun kept going after the man, trying to cut off the mask.\nAt that moment, huge flames engulfed the body of the man.\nWheik!\n‘This one?’\nChun Yeowun frowned. He used flames to escape from the crisis.\n“Ahhhhh!”\nThe man crossed his arms and swung the flame around like a tornado.\nNow, a whirlwind of flames was soaring high in the cave right between them.\n“Subordinate!”\nThe whirlwind of flame which was between them kept getting stronger.\n‘I-it’s getting stronger.’\nChun Woo-kyung got up from his seat and moved back in fear that the flames would touch him.\nIf he kept sitting there trying to control the energy, he might get swept away.\nKwakwang!\nThe entire cave was devastated.\nCracks and fragments everywhere, powerful enough for the cave to collapse and bury everyone.\n‘No! If this goes on, I might die here.’\nHe didn’t have the time to control the energy of the Flame Qilin in his body.\nChun Woo-kyung, who thought that he might die, tried to escape from the cave passage.\nIt was then.\nSwoosh!\nThe flames which were going around wildly changed.\nA terrifying coldness rose, and the flames, which didn’t look like they could go down, were subsiding into water and vapour.\n‘F-flame is…’\nShocked, Chun Woo-kyung looked back.\nPang!\nIn the dying flames, someone’s body was thrown in the direction of Chun Woo-kyung.\nThe subordinate.\nBounce, thud!\nThe floor shattered as the man kept bouncing.\nAfter rolling on the floor multiple times, the man stopped, barely catching his breath and exhaling harshly.\n“Huk… huk…”\n‘Ah!’\nMeanwhile, Chun Woo-kyung checked to see if his mask was intact.\nFortunately, the mask did have cracks, and the colour changed because of the heat, but it was still there.\nThe mask was fine.\n‘… even this monster is not an opponent for him.’\nVictory and defeat.\nThe subordinate was no match for Chun Ma.\nJust seeing that the monstrous man stagger with ragged breathing, was enough proof for anyone to understand it, the man was afraid of Chun Ma now.\n‘He is not human… kuak!’\nChun Woo-kyung grabbed his stomach as the Flame Qilin’s blood moved inside.\nIf he was careless in his movement and control, the Flame qi might devour him.\n‘We have no chance of winning.’\nChun Woo-kyung looked at the face of the subordinate.\nIf this went on, both would die together.\n‘… nothing more can be done.’\nIt was unfortunate, but it seemed like there was no other chance for Chun Woo-kyung to escape.\nThere was no other way to live.\nChun Woo-kyung, who made that decision, ordered the man.\n“Subordinate. Just kill him.”\nHe said that so that he could run away.\nHowever, the man didn’t respond this time.\n“What are you standing there for? Kill him…”\nThe man turned.\n‘Thi…’\nHe didn’t realize it as he only looked at the back, but when the man turned, he saw that the mask had been torn off, and the face was covered in blood.\n‘Shit. His face!’\nHe tried to keep the man away from the sight of others, but it didn’t work.\nBut it didn’t matter.\nEither way, the man was only going to buy some time for Chun Woo-kyung to escape.\n“Sigh…don’t worry about the mask. Just kill him…”\nIt was then.\nGrab!\n“Kuak!”\nThe subordinate moved at the speed of lightning and grabbed his neck.\nShocked, Chun Woo-kyung tried to push him away.\n“Cough, what are you doing…”\n“Who should I kill?”\n“What?”\n“And who is the subordinate?”\n‘!!!’\nChun Woo-kyung’s face went stiff at the voice, which wasn’t slurred and not child-like anymore.\nHis eyes trembled at what he thought.\n‘N-no way….’\nAt his bewilderment, the subordinate showed his bright red eyes and shouted with pride.\n“I am Hu Bong, the lieutenant of Lord Chun Yeowun, the Demon God of the Great Sky Demon Order!”",

      "content": "Chapter 81: Legacy of Demon God (3)\n‘\nH-how does he remember already?’\nThe doctor said it would take an entire month for his brain to get back to normal.\nWell, that's in normal cases.\nWhen trapped in the whirlwind of those fierce flames, in order to subdue the rebellious Hu Bong, Chun Yeowun inflicted a hit to the head.\nThat was the starting point.\nThe moment the head was injured, the Flame qi and Flame Qilin's blood began to heal it, regenerating the brain cells in the process.\nBut Chun Woo-kyung was unaware of it, so he was shocked.\nAt that time, the grip on his neck was so strong.\nClench!\n“Cough!”\nHu Bong, who revealed his identity, couldn’t hide his anger.\nWhen his memory returned, he remembered everything he had done.\n“How dare you pretend to be him?”\nHe couldn’t forgive the man.\nFor Hu Bong, there was only one Chun Ma.\n‘I-I can’t breath…’\nAs if the Flame Qilin's blood inside of him wasn't enough, Hu Bong was now killing him.\nBut.\nPak!\nHu Bong grabbed the man’s hand.\n“Let… g…”\n“Let go of what?”\nHu Bong broke his wrist without warning.\nCrack!\n“Kuaak!”\nThe broken bone twisted in a weird form.\nIf not for the pain, then Chun Woo-kyung’s face was red because of being grabbed by the neck.\nHu Bong showed no sign of releasing him.\n“How dare a bastard like you seek the title and legacy of the Lord!”\nDespite having the blood of Qilin inside of him, Chun Woo-kyung couldn’t handle Hu Bong’s Flame qi.\nThat was when someone called him.\n“Hu Bong.”\n‘!!!’\nThe moment he heard that voice, Hu Bong’s face contorted.\nHe was unable to hold back his emotions, and with tears forming in his eyes, he threw away the body of Chun Woo-kyung and rushed to Chun Yeowun.\n“Looorrrrrddddddd!”\nHearing Hu Bong's winy words, Chun Yeowun had a change of expression too.\nEven though Chun Yeowun’s emotions were never shown, he never dreamed of meeting Hu Bong in this era.\n“My Lord, your first and eternal lieutenant Hu Bong is… ugh… wahhh…”\nHe couldn’t stop the tears from pouring down.\nHu Bong’s feelings couldn’t be expressed in words.\n“Same here. Hu Bong.”\nChun Yeowun spoke to him in a soft voice. It was because he was moved by the unchanging loyalty.\n“My Lorrrd! Wahhh!”\nHearing that, Hu Bong burst into tears once again.\nDespite having the looks of a man in his 30s, it seemed like Hu Bong hadn’t changed.\nHu Bong was still Hu Bong.\n“Kuuaa…”\nChun Woo-kyung, who had been thrown away by Hu Bong, grabbed his stomach and groaned.\nHe wasn’t feeling well.\n‘Flame qi… I am unable to control it…’\nAnd as time went on, the Flame qi in his body grew stronger.\nHis intestines were swelling up as if he suffered from internal injuries.\nIf he wouldn’t be able to control it, then he might die right there.\n‘Kuaa. I need to get out of here.’\nChun Woo-kyung forced himself to endure the pain in order to escape the place.\nThe pain was so severe that he felt like he would lose his reason.\nEven if it meant he had to crawl, he had to get out of the place.\nPuak!\nThat was when, something pierced his left calf.\n“Shit!”\nNot only that.\nHe felt another thing pierce his right calf.\n“Ackk!”\nChun Woo-kyung screamed and looked at what lodged itself in his calves.\n‘T-this?’\nIt was nothing but the ice swords.\nTwo Ice Swords pierced his calves to the ground, making him unable to move.\nShhh!\nAs he fell into bewilderment, Chun Yeowun appeared in front of him.\n“Who told you you could go?”\n“Ch-chun Ma!”\nChun Woo-kyung’s face darkened at Chun Yeowun’s words.\nSince the moment he saw Chun Yeowun in the video, he had been certain that such a day would come.\n“You must realize your sins, right?”\nThe fake Sky Demon Sword and the fake jade plaque.\nHe even declared himself as the next Chun Ma.\nDeath was the only possible punishment for those who committed such grave sins.\nGrunt!\nChun Woo-kyung ground his teeth.\nHatred was emanating from his eyes more than fear.\n‘If only you… you hadn’t appeared…’\nUnlike Chun Yu-seong, who begged for his life in the face of death, this man resented Chun Yeowun.\nIf Chun Yeowun hadn’t appeared, his plan would have been executed without a single hitch.\n‘Sky Demon Order…. The title of Chun Ma… all mine.’\nHe could have had all that, but now, everything had collapsed.\nHe resented the man for it.\nChun Woo-kyung, who decided that it was too late for him to escape, spit out all the words he had been holding in his heart.\n“From the moment the Cult was dissolved and till now, you didn’t bother showing yourself once, but now you come up when it was going to finally have a Lord? Why are you even meddling in the affairs of your descendants…”\nPuck!\n“Kuak!”\nBefore he could even finish what he was saying, Chun Yeowun looked bitter.\nGrunt.\nAs he kept coughing up blood, Chun Yeowun said.\n“Meddle? What a joke..”\n“Kuak”\n“Right. Whether you fight for the position of Lord or not is your matter, but how could you allow yourself to impersonate Chun Ma?”\nChun Woo-kyung, who was coughing up blood, raised his head and said.\n“Kuaak… a thousand years… are you saying that it was wrong to use the title of Chun Ma, not used since a thousand years ago, for the sake of reuniting the scattered Cult?”\nThere are people who do not bend their beliefs in any situation.\nChun Woo-kyung was such a man. He never thought that he did anything wrong.\n“After the dissolving of the Cult, the members were all divided into 3 factions, and they fought each other for 27 years. Despite enemies lurking around, our confrontation kept going on. How could such a Cult be brought into one? By killing others? Do you think that by killing and weakening the power, you will make the Cult one?”\nWhen Chun Yeowun said nothing, he continued in anger.\n“How can we know whether the lost Sky Demon Sword still existed or not? How could we know you would actually stay alive for a thousand years? Even if it was a fake sword, it was to bring everyone together…”\nBang!\nBefore he could finish, Chun Woo-kyung’s head was crushed to the floor.\nChun Yeowun said in a cold tone.\n“I can’t hear this anymore.”\n“Kuaaa.”\n“A person who cares so much for the Cult hires assassins because I appeared?”\nChun Woo-kyung’s body trembled.\nHe wondered why the man on the phone never called him back, but he was sure that assassins had gone to Chun Yeowun.\nNot caring about the man’s thoughts, Chun Yeowun continued.\n“And the fact that the Cult has been like this for 27 years is because of your incompetence, but you’ve put up a good font with all that bullshit.”\nNo excuse was acceptable.\nConsidering that he was his descendant, he didn’t kill him right away and heard the words. But the excuses were disappointing.\n“You aren’t even worth keeping alive.”\nShhh!\nWhen Chun Yeowun took his foot off the head, Chun Woo-kyung's body was lifted up.\nIt was more painful as his calves still had ice swords struck in them.\n“Acckk!”\nChun Woo-kyung’s battered face was screaming, but Chun Yeowun didn’t mind and put his palm on the Dantian.\n“What are you…”\n“Taking back what you coveted.”\n“What?”\nWoong!\nAt that moment, energy rushed into his Dantian.\n“Achhh!”\nA wave of energy.\nChun Woo-kyung, who couldn’t handle it, bent.\nThe energy, which entered his Dantian, broke it apart.\nNoticing something, Chun Yeowun said.\n“I thought you must have absorbed even a little, but you don’t seem the least bit talented.”\n“What…”\nPuck!\nChun Yeowun slowly brought up the palm which was on the Dantian.\n“Eukk!”\nA reflux-like feeling was felt within, eventually, the palm reached the neck.\n“Kuak!”\nRed thick liquid gushed from the mouth.\nThe blood of Flame Qilin, the liquid he had drunk.\nChun Woo-kyung was unable to absorb the blood because of its attribute.\nDung!\nThe blood, which came out of the body, floated in the air without a single drop being wasted to the ground.\nChun Woo-kyung looked at that in disbelief.\n“It is dirty, but it is a waste to let this go.”\nSwh!\n“My lord, here.”\nHu Bong came to his side carrying a vial.\nChun Yeowun put the blood of Flame Qilin into it.\n“Uhhh!”\nIn the end, not a single thing Chun Woo-kyung wanted, had happened.\nEven the blood of Flame Qilin was stolen away.\nChun Woo-kyung looked at Chun Yeowun with resentment.\n“The same till the end. That is the one thing I like about you.”\nBut he wouldn’t spare the man.\nChun Yeowun grabbed something in the air.\nChun Woo-kyung’s head collapsed under the internal energy.\nCrack!\n“Kuaak!”\nAnd then, Chun Yeowun clenched his fist tighter in the air.\nCrack!\nThe head shattered like a watermelon.\nThe last member of the three factions, who dreamed of being the Lord, lived a tragic end.\nEven though he was his blood descendant, Chun Yeowun didn’t show mercy.\n“Hu Bong.”\n“Yes, my lord.”\n“Burn him.”\n“Yep!”\nWheik!\nFlames rose from Hu Bong’s hands and burned Chun Woo-kyung’s corpse.\nChun Yeowun and Hu Bong, who left the cave, went up to the point where the barracks were set.\nChun Yeowun asked Hu Bong what he wanted to know the most.\n“What the hell happened?”\nHu Bong was here in the current era, and Chun Yeowun was curious about how that happened.\nHu Bong, who was still happy to see Chun Yeowun right in front of him, spoke with tears in his eyes.\n“My Lord! My Lord was said to have fallen into the distant future. How could I not have waited for you?”\n“What?”\nChun Yeowun’s eyes trembled at those words.\nUnlike the Great Guardian, Hu Bong seemed convinced that he had crash-landed into the future instead of some random cooked up story.",

      "content": "Chapter 82: Legacy of Demon God (4)\nHu Bong.\nA loyal follower of Chun Yeowun since the early days of the Academy, an institution with the role of fostering the warriors of the Sky Demon Order.\nOriginally, he was a small clan member, but he became the lieutenant and right-hand of Chun Yeowun after overcoming the other subordinates.\nIn a way, he was like Chun Yeowun’s friend and lieutenant at the same time.\n“How do you know that?”\nChun Yeowun asked in shock.\nEven the Great Guardian of the present age, the Guardian of the Sky Demon Order, didn’t know the exact story.\nSo what happened?\n“That’s what the warrior Seong Mu-chun said.”\n“He?”\nChun Yeowun couldn’t hide his curiosity.\nIt was strange that descendant Chun Mu-seong, who was concerned about the spread of information about the future, was going around saying stuff.\n“It is different from what the Great Guardian of this era said.”\n“Huh? My Lord, this era, you mean you are talking about the Great Guardian one thousand years from then?”\n“Right.”\n“Oh! The Cult is alive and well!”\nHu Bong trembled as if it was an odd thing.\nAlthough there was faith, no Cult member would not show such a reaction hearing that the Cult was alive a thousand years later.\nChun Yeowun shook his head.\n“No. It dissolved 27 years ago.”\n“Yes? The Cult is? W-what is that…”\nHu Bong’s expression changed with those words.\nHu Bong was a man with various expressions.\n“First listen to me and then tell me about this situation.”\nChun Yeowun informed him of what happened, and relaid what Marayun said.\nHu Bong kept nodding through the story and then said while clapping his hands.\n“I think I know.”\n“Hmm?”\n“Maybe it was because of Seong Mu-chun’s request.”\n“He made a request?”\n“Yes. He said that no one but us should know about this. That… What did he say… moth? No! Butterfly! Right. He said something about the future changing because of a butterfly effect! That it may cause us not to meet with the Lord.”\n[Butterfly effect. Even the most minor changes or small events could lead to unexpected results in the future, just like the flapping of a butterfly’s small wings could cause major weather changes.]\nNano explained it to Chun Yeowun.\nThanks to that, he understood what Hu Bong tried to say.\n‘It was because of the fear that history will be changed or affected?’\nWhen it came to space and time axis, one couldn’t be sure.\nHis descendant Chun Mu-seong, who lived in the era of time travel possibilities, wasn’t sure what changes could happen.\n“Hu Bong. Do you know his real name?”\n“Huh? Real name?”\nAt that response, Chun Yeowun was sure of one thing, that his descendant didn’t reveal all the facts.\nLike the fact that he came from the future.\n“Nothing. Hu Bong, so after hearing from him that I fell into the future, you waited for me?”\nAt his question, Hu Bong’s eyes turned red again.\n“My Lord was alone. How can I leave you like that when I am your right-hand! Euhhh!”\n“You… really…”\nAt those words, Chun Yeowun felt his throat go tight.\nHu Bong couldn’t leave him alone, so he ended up in slumber for a thousand years.\nAnd this loyalty was enough to move Chun Yeowun’s heart.\n“Now that I have met Lord again, I can rest in peace… ah, it isn’t like I am going to die or anything. If I die, I won’t be able to serve my Lord.”\nChun Yeowun smiled bitterly at the shivering and crying of Hu Bong.\nHu Bong was the one who used to make him smile.\n“Hu Bong. Just how were you able to endure it all this time?”\nAchieving such a feat would require a tremendous amount of courage and mental strength.\nChun Yeowun didn’t know that Hu Bong was sealed in the ice.\n“I was stuck in ice.”\n“Ice?”\n“The man said that it was called hibernation.”\n“Hibernation?”\n“A method of freezing people, and if frozen like that, one could survive without getting old. But I thought that I would die of cold. Euuu.”\nHu Bong shuddered at the terrible experience he went through.\nThe person who froze him was Dan Ju-cheon, who was brought in from the Ice Palace. He was able to make the strongest ice which wouldn’t melt unless it was purposely melted.\n“I don’t think I will ever do something like that again.”\n“You did something dangerous.”\nActually, such a thing was dangerous for ordinary people to do.\nIn the future, there were safe means to defrost those in hibernation, but not the time they were in now.\n“I had the blood of the spirit beast, so I was the only one who could do it.”\nHe could do it because he had great regenerative abilities.\nHu Bong wanted to meet Chun Yeowun even if it meant losing himself in the process.\n“Hu Bong, you really are…”\nThe man could have really died, but the fact that he was alive made it even more emotional.\n“You are so foolish to try all this to meet me.”\nAt that, Hu Bong said.\n“It is because I had to meet the Lord and take you back.”\n“What?”\nChun Yeowun’s face hardened at that.\nIt was impossible for them to move through space and time as they were in a place where science hadn’t developed that far.\n“What do you mean? Take me back?”\n“Seong Mu-chun said there was a way to get the Lord back to us.”\n“A way back?”\nChun Yeowun’s eyes fluttered. This was completely unexpected.\nIt was shocking that Hu Bong had gone into hibernation and waited all this time to take Chun Yeowun back.\n“… what is that?”\nCalming his heart, Chun Yeowun asked.\nHu Bong responded, a bit perplexed.\n“That… I don’t know exactly.”\n“What? You don’t know how but you plan on taking me back?”\n“He said that he had a divine object which would allow the Lord to return to our time. But he didn’t tell me what it was.”\n“Divine object?”\nChun Yeowun frowned at the word.\nThe word Divine Object meant it was very special.\nAnd if it was an object that would help in time travelling, then there was one thing Chun Yeowun could think of.\n‘Timepack?’\nTimepack, a space-time movement device from the era of his descendant.\nHowever, it was a disposable and personal device.\nIf Chun Yeowun could remember correctly, Chun Mu-seong had just one timepack left with him to go back to his era.\n‘No…’\nIf the object Hu Bong was talking about was indeed that, then Chun Mu-seong had given up on returning to his time.\nChun Yeowun felt a weird feeling in his stomach.\nNot realising that, Hu Bong continued.\n“He said that the object could make the Lord come back again. But he said that it can’t fall into others’ hands, and to destroy it before that happens.”\n“Did you hide that divine object?”\n“Kya! Indeed my Lord! I made sure to hide it so that no one could find it.”\nIf it was the timepack that Chun Yeowun was thinking of, then it could never be given to someone else.\n‘Ah!’\nChun Yeowun thought of something else.\n“Hu Bong…. Did you sacrifice yourself to tell me this?”\nAt first, he thought that Hu Bong was here to not leave him alone in the future.\nBut that didn’t seem right.\nHu Bong said that he waited a thousand years to reveal where he had hidden the timepack and make sure that Chun Yeowun heads back to the past.\n“Are… are you insane?”\nChun Yeowun was experiencing a mix of emotions.\nThe timepack would allow only one person to go back.\n“That divine object…”\nHu Bong interrupted Chun Yeowun, who was about to say something.\n“Lord… I know.”\n“What do you know!”\n“He said that only one person could use it.”\nAt Hu Bong’s words, Chun Yeowun furiously shouted.\n“You went through this knowing that!”\nIt wasn’t to criticize him.\nIt was because he didn’t want to accept the idea of letting Hu Bong sacrifice himself.\nThud!\nHu Bong knelt down with tears in his eyes.\nLooking into Chun Yeowun’s eyes, he said.\n“Lord! You need to go back! All the members of the Cult are waiting for you!”\n“You…”\n“And Lord! Mun Ku… Mun Ku is waiting for you. We can’t let your only child grow up without a father, right? Euuhhh!”\nHu Bong began to cry again.\nChun Yeowun, who was feeling complicated, looked up and covered his eyes.\nHe never felt this frustrated even when he crash-landed into the future, but he was feeling more pain at Hu Bong’s words.\n‘Mu-seong… Mu-seong… you really…’\nChun Yeowun blamed his descendant.\nEven if it was for Chun Yeowun, Chun Mu-seong did a cruel thing.\nHe made Hu Bong sacrifice himself.\n‘What a pain.’\nChun Yeowun was clever, but right now, his mind didn’t work.\nEverything was messed up.\nSince this era was on a different axis, time was passing in other ones.\nHe himself saw that he could do nothing in this era which was so different to him, so how could Hu Bong stay here?\n‘You should have just waited for me.’\nThat seemed way better to him.\nChun Yeowun could have waited until a space-time device was developed and then use it.\nThat required a lot of patience from Chun Yeowun, but at least Hu Bong wouldn’t have to be sacrificed.\n‘Casualty?’\nNot everything would go the way he wanted.\nAs much as he wanted to return back to the original era, a sacrifice was needed.\nClench!\nChun Yeowun bit his lip.\n“Loord!”\n“Hu Bong.”\n“… yes.”\nHu Bong responded with a dull face.\nHe knew that Chun Yeowun would be angry, but Hu Bong was happy.\n‘My Lord thinks so much of me…’\nIf he didn’t care about him, he wouldn’t be so angry.\nHe felt like celebrating his sacrifice.\n“Don’t even think about making sacrifices.”\n“Sorry?”\n“I am taking you with me.”\n“L-Lord!”\nHu Bong was touched. He was moved by the words he heard.\nIt felt like he was being paid for the sacrifices he made.\n‘Lord… this much is enough for me. Even if the Lord goes back alone, I feel like I have achieved everything.’\nJust words were enough.\nContrary to his thoughts, Chun Yeowun never said empty words.\n‘… I will find it. A way to take Hu Bong back!’\nOne thought came to his mind.\nIf the hidden timepack was a machine, then he could have Nano do an analysis.\nIf Nano’s system was locked and refused to, then he would just find a brilliant scientist and find a way.\nFirst, the Divine Object has to be found.\n“Hu Bong.”\n“Yes, Lord?”\n“Where is that divine object?”\nWith an apologising expression , Hu Bong said.\n“Lord, I am sorry. I don’t exactly know where, but I have a password.”\n“Password?”\n“And the password…”\nChun Yeowun touched his forehead.\n“You hid something else, didn’t you?”\n“I apologize. Lord!”\nThud! Thud!\nHu Bong banged his head on the floor.\nDespite being hurt, he kept banging again and again.\nAnnoyed, Chun Yeowun raised his hand.\nWoong!\nHu Bong was lifted up.\n“Just saying.”\nThere was one thing that Chun Yeowun was worried about.\nMarayun had clearly said there were three legacies left behind.\nChun Yeowun was really hoping that he was wrong.\n“Hu Bong… you aren’t the only one waiting, right?”\nHu Bong answered very slowly.\n“Yes…”\n“Ackhh! I’m going crazy!”\nHis headache was reaching its peak.\n“You people are really…”\nHe never thought that the loyalty of his subordinates would end up biting him like this.\n“Who else?... Tell me quickly.”\nThere were two people he could guess.\nBesides Hu Bong, there were two others who took the blood of a spirit beast.\nHu Bong clasped his hands and said.\n“L-Lord. Since just one wasn’t guaranteed to survive, we had to go all three of us.”\n“What?”\n“Baekgi went into hibernation after seeing the kids, and I went into hibernation right away with my partner.”\n“Your partner?”\nChun Yeowun couldn’t understand Hu Bong’s words.\nAs far as he knew, Baekgi wasn’t even married in the first place, and he had no idea who the other person was.\nBaekgi had taken the Dragon Turtle’s blood, but who was the other.\n“What the hell? Did you come with your wife!”\n“Mun Ran-yeong. Lord.”\n“…”\nChun Yeowun stood speechless for a moment.\nMun Ran-yeong, whom Hu Bong spoke of, was the Great elder.\nShe was a loyalist who stayed in the imperial palace protecting the Flame Qilin’s blood for a long time.\nChun Yeowun even gave her the highest position for it.\n“Mun Ran-yeong?”\n“Yes.”\nHu Bong smiled shyly.\nChun Yeowun stared at Hu Bong with widened eyes. He married an older woman who was a hundred years apart in age.\nBesides she was.\n‘Mun Ku’s ancestor.’\nShe was from the same clan as Mun Ku, Chun Yeowun’s lover.\nThis was really twisted.\nEven Chun Yeowun, who was never easily surprised, was really shocked at this news.\n“Hu Bong… you are a shocking person…”\n“Hehe. Somehow it ended like that.”\nHu Bong ruffled his hair.\n“Ah! Lord!”\nHu Bong suddenly drew something on the ground.\nShhh!\n“What are you doing?”\n“The password that Seong Mu-chun gave me. I don’t know what this means, but I was told to memorize this.”\nWhat Hu Bong drew was a square.\nAnd then he started adding many other shapes. They were mostly squares and rectangles.\n36 Quadrangles.\n‘What is this?’\nChun Yeowun couldn’t think of anything until Nano said.\n[This is a TQC code.]\n‘TQC code?’\n[A password created in 2600.]\n‘Ah!’\nA password used in the future.\nHis descendant Chun Mu-seong took measures so that even if the legacy was found, the person wouldn’t know what he was trying to convey.\n‘He was very thorough about this.’\nFortunately, Nano didn’t have a lock on deciphering.\n‘Can you decipher it?’\n[It isn’t possible. There is only the Q code.]\n‘What?’\n[TQC code is made of Triangle, Quadrangle and Circle.]\nThree codes need to be combined.\nHu Bong had one of the three codes.\nWhich meant the code could be unlocked when the other two people were also found.\n“My Lord, I was told that you would surely know.”\n“Right.”\nA code which only Chun Yeowun, in this era, could understand.\nChun Yeowun moved.\n“We need to find the other two.”\nThe code was one thing, but he also couldn’t leave them in hibernation for long.\nHu Bong opened his mouth carefully.\n“Hmm. Lord. Then I will start with the person I know…”\nFlinch!\nIt was then.\nChun Yeowun stretched out his hand to the east.\nSwoosh! Bang!\nAt that moment, a huge explosion occurred, with the sound of something flying in.\nThe blast tore all the tents around the place at once.",

      "content": "Chapter 83: Vanished (1)\nOn a mountain, 2,5 km away from Mount Hanbaek.\nInside a tent under the transmission tower.\n-Click! Distance secured.\n“It is more than 2.5km.”\n-Target?\nAt the altered voice from the walkie-talkie, A man wearing a black mask looked at the screen on the monitor.\nThere were three monitors in total, each monitor had ten cameras displayed on it.\nAll of the cameras were shooting from different angles, but the target was the same.\n“Still in the barracks.”\nHearing the answer, the masked man continued to ask.\n“Do we have to be this careful?”\n-The target is estimated to be an S-level target or higher. Accurate measurement is still required.\n“Still, it will be impossible to notice from this distance.”\n-Don’t lower your guard. If it’s an S-level target we are talking about, he must be around Supreme master level.\n“Supreme Master…”\nThe Murim people who learned martial arts had the ability called Energy Feeling.\nThey could sense the energy of humans or anything else within a specific range. It works for 20 meters for first-rate warriors, 50 meters for a Super Master and 100 meters for those at the end of Super master.\nAnd its realm could widen as one grows.\nWarriors who reach past the level of Superior Master could sense beyond 500 meters.\nOf course, that’s considering that the opponent doesn’t hide himself.\n“I covered it up with an energy breaker, so there is no way he won’t be caught. It will definitely be enough to kill him.”\nIf the opponent was hiding his presence, it would be difficult to detect him no matter how good the warrior was.\nTents over here had the ability to shut off the energy flow.\n-The drone has moved.\n“Moved to 1km point.”\n-Target?\n“No change yet.”\n-In case of a silent drone, it cannot be detected for 1 km.\n“Should we move closer?”\n-No. That’s enough. Carry out the mission.\n“Roger.”\nAs if the masked man was waiting, he moved the device ahead of the monitor.\nAnd then a red cross aiming for a certain point appeared on the screen.\n“Fire.”\nAt those words, the masked man pressed the red button, and a missile was launched along with a smokescreen.\nPush!\nThe missile flew towards the target. It would take just 3 to 4 seconds to hit the target.\nKwakwakwang!\n30 rockets bombarded the barracks simultaneously.\nA huge explosion occurred, setting the entire garrison on fire.\nIt was so huge of an explosion that not a single Murim warrior would be able to survive.\nRumble!\nThe explosive force was enough to crumble the ice on the mountain.\nThe area was completely destroyed.\n“Done.”\nThe masked man looked at the screen.\n“I will withdraw before the National Agency gets dispatched.”\nAn explosion of this magnitude was bound to be noticed by the Defense.\nBefore that, they had to call back their drones and move away.\nOf course, knowing the procedure, he was ready to type the command.\n-Are you sure?\n“What?”\n-This target destroyed the Scepter 27 lab, so we need to be certain. Fire all the remaining ones.\n“Now?”\nThe masked man asked.\nDue to the recent launch, the whole area was already devastated. If he fired another missile, it was bound to cause landslides in the close-by areas, and the aftermath would be huge.\nThings might turn troublesome if people start to trace them.\n-Are you disobeying orders?\n“N-no!”\nDisobeying orders calls only for death.\nThe masked man was forced to carry out the command.\nHe had to use all the missiles.\nThat was when.\n‘Uh?’\nThe eyes of the masked man trembled as he looked at the monitor.\nA change occurred within the flames that burned after the explosion.\nThe flames began to whirl.\n“H-How is this…”\n-What is happening?\n“Something strange is happening.”\nThe flames which twirled around turned smaller and then were distinguished.\nIn the centre stood the target, Chun Yeowun.\nNot only was he unharmed, but there was also another man with red hair standing right next to him.\nBoth were alive.\n“T-target is alive. Unharmed!”\nThe man was bewildered.\nThe altered voice gave the command.\n-Hand over the control to me.\n“Huh?”\n-Hurry!\n“Yes.”\nWhen the masked man typed something, the drone cameras moved.\nThe control was passed.\nOn 10 screens, the precision aiming was on the target Chun yeowun.\nAnd the remaining...\n‘Mountain!’\nIt was facing the nearby hillsides.\nHe intended to hit the close-by ranges and bury them both alive.\nPush!\nMissiles were fired simultaneously.\nThey moved at the speed of 1 Mach and reached the location in 3 seconds.\nBut something unbelievable happened.\n“Huh?”\nThe masked man exclaimed in shock.\nThe missiles, which were simultaneously flying for the target, stopped in mid-air at once.\nChun Yeowun, who hacked into the drones, zoomed in on the camera screen, and raised his right arm out.\n‘No way!’\nWhile doing this, Chun Yeowun pretended to hold something.\nPush!\nThe trajectory of the stopped missiles changed.\nThe missiles had turned around at once and began to flow again.\n“N-No way!”\nThey couldn’t believe what their eyes were seeing.\nThe missiles moved towards the drones.\nThe masked man shouted in a hurry.\n“Move the drones!”\nThe masked man spoke to the man who was controlling them.\nThe drones immediately moved away to avoid being hit.\nBut there was no way they could outspeed missiles.\nThe missiles flew and hit all the drones.\nBang! Bang! Bang!\nAt the same time, all the screens went black.\n“Shit!”\nThe masked man grew nervous.\nHe thought all cameras were destroyed, but three were still fine. It seemed like three drones could avoid the missiles.\n-…is that so?\nThe altered voice mumbled.\nAnd then a black shadow appeared on one of the screens.\n“Ah!”\nThe camera screen was moving.\n-This!\n-Tap! Tap!\nThe altered voice spoke in distress, and the sound of tapping could be heard.\nAt that time, the camera pointed to someone.\nAnd he was.\n“Target!”\nChun Yeowun.\n“W-what the hell?”\nHe couldn’t understand this.\nThe location of the drone was about 1km away from the target.\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun extended his hand towards the drone.\n“What is he doing?”\nThe masked man asked in a puzzled voice.\nThe altered voice spoke.\n-How can this happen?\n“What happened?”\n-H-he is trying to hack the drones.\n“What?”\nThe masked man couldn’t hide how absurd it sounded.\nChun Yeowun just extended his hand at the drone. So how could he hack it?\nHe couldn’t understand what was happening, but if the target was indeed trying to do that, then they had to stop it.\nSo the masked man pressed the black button with an X.\nAt that moment.\nClick!\nBoth screens turned black at the same time.\nIt was the self-destruction option of the drones.\nHowever, the drone, which was shaking, didn’t turn off.\n“H-how?”\n-Controls of the drones have been taken over. I can’t control it, nor can you.\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun, who was on the screen, mumbled something.\nIt was a short word, so one could tell by the shaping of the lips.o\n‘Found it?’\nAnd with that, Chun yeowun disappeared from the camera screen.\nThe masked man’s eyes searched in fear.\nShhh!\nAs he was doing that, the devices in front of him began to spark, and he heard something.\nThe device was being destroyed.\nAnd the voice in his earphone said.\n-If you want to live, destroy everything and withdraw right away.\nChh! Click!\nBefore he could do anything, the tent tore open, and someone fell in.\nThe masked man was drenched in a cold sweat and stiffened.\nThere was someone right behind him.\n-What is happening? No…\nNothing could be heard.\nIf he stood still, he would be bound to be killed.\n“Damnnnn!”\nThe masked man quickly turned back and gave strength to his arms.\nHis clothes tore, and guns popped out of his arms.\nBoth arms were modified with machine guns.\nThe moment he was about to fire.\nClash!\nHis arms were cut.\n“KuaaK!”\nBecause the shoulders were made of flesh and bones, he felt pain.\nWhen the masked man looked at his fallen arms, Chun Yeowun said.\n“You modified your body.”\nChun Yeowun looked at the fallen arms and mumbled.\nHe had met such people before.\nThey were assassins sent by the MS group.\nPak!\nChun Yeowun reached out to the man who was in pain.\nA coldness flowed out and froze the body of the man.\nJkkk!\n“Kuaak!”\nIt was to prevent him from self-destructing.\nChun Yeowun noticed something in the man’s ear.\nHe reached out his hand, and the earphone came out.\nHe put his finger on it and put it in his ear.\n‘Nano- track the location.’\n[Alright.]\nAfter giving the order to Nano, Chun Yeowun said.\n“Ms Group?”\n-….\nSeeing that he didn’t answer, he felt that the man on the other side must be shocked.\n“You people are pretty tough. You think I won’t be able to destroy all of you?”\n-Looks like you are trying to track us down.\nChun Yeowun tried to pass the time until the tracking happened, but the man noticed.\nSince the drones were hacked, the operator knew that tracking back was possible.\nNano was still busy tracking.\n“I will give you a chance. Stop coming after me. Otherwise, I will make you regret it. I have a knack for finding and killing people like you.”\nNot an empty warning.\n-We’ll see who will die. Good luck.\nClick!\nWith that, the connection was cut off.\n[The other side has disconnected.]\nBecause the time was short, even Nano couldn’t track it.\nBecause there were several devices that could block tracking, it required time.\nCrack!\nChun Yeowun mumbled as he crashed the earphone.\n“… we’ll see.”\nLetting that voice live didn’t sit well with him.\nUnknown location.\nThere, someone was typing while looking at the screen.\nAt the top of the screen, was an analysis table, and below it, was a picture of Chun Yeowun with ‘S-class hazard level’ written under it.\nTap! Tap!\nThe letters were written at high speed.\n[Able to move 1.5km within 6 seconds. Has the ability to fly. Seems to have abilities similar to telekinesis, but only in a range of 1km. In the video, the accuracy of the missile’s trajectory dropped as it moved near the 1km mark. Has enough defence to withstand the bombardment of cm204-class missiles.]\nThe person was writing an analysis of Chun Yeowun.\nAfter a long detailed recording, the person put the last remarks.\n[Request to increase the hazard level from S-class to SSS-class.]\nThat window was brought down, and another was opened.\nA picture of Hu Bong next to Chun Yeowun.\nAs the cursor was dragged, he zoomed in on something in Hu Bong’s hands.\nA vial containing Flame Qilin’s blood.\nAfter capturing the zoomed-in photo, he wrote in the report again.\nTatatap!\n[Assumed to be the same form kept in Scepter 49 lad. Analysis wind.]",

      "content": "Chapter 84: Vanished (2)\nTremble! Tremble!\nA man with rugged looks and cut-off arms trembled on the ground.\nHe didn’t seem to be in good condition, considering all the burn marks on his body.\nThey were torture marks.\n“Haa… Ha…”\nThe man clicked his tongue as he looked at Chun Yeowun sitting in front of him.\nHis body froze, so he assumed that he had died.\nSince his body was enhanced, there was a self-destruct device planted in his brain and other parts of the body.\nThey should have melted his body from the inside, but when he gained consciousness, he found himself still alive.\n[H-how am I still?]\n[Did you think your plan would work?]\nPieces of metal, which seemed to be parts of a detonator, were scattered on the floor.\nHe couldn’t figure out how they were extracted.\n‘This guy is a damn monster.’\nAnd because of that, his body didn’t melt.\nHe was tortured.\n“Where is your people’s base?”\n“Haa… Ha… I really… don’t know.”\nSnap! Pang!\n“Kuaak!”\nChun Yeowun snapped his finger, and the big toe exploded.\nThe man had already been in this kind of pain for an hour.\nChun Yeowun put the nano bombs inside him.\n“Kuak… I, I told you before. This earphone…. We just got a call from it. I went to the contact point and executed the order…”\n“Hmm.”\nChun Yeowun patted his chin and looked at the man.\n50 nano bombs were detonated in an hour, but he kept repeating the same words.\n‘Nano, your results?’\n[Pupillary contraction, movement of facial muscles, heart rate. All the same. The chance of lying is less than 5%.]\nChun Yeowun sighed in disappointment.\nClearly, this organization was meticulous about the spread of information.\n‘It is like abandoning everything when needed.’\nTo be able to dispose of the workers at any time.\nThose related to the MS group didn’t have any information either.\nWhat was more absurd is that when he asked Nano to search through the internet, it said that they disbanded 15 years ago.\nIt was as if the organization didn’t exist. It felt like a waste of time.\n‘I think it would be better to find someone of a higher position.’\nChun Yeowun got up from his chair.\nAnd without hesitation, he decapitated the man.\nSlash!\n“Kuak!”\nThe man who was slashed in an instant, fell to the ground with a slight groan.\nAfter all, if this guy was already abandoned, then it was definite that the MS groups would have blocked all the networks this man could use to contact them back.\n“Hu Bong.”\n“Yes!”\nWheik!\nWhen Chun Yeowun left the tent, Hu Bong set fire to the man.\nHu Bong’s fire was much hotter than normal flame, so it was the best to erase the traces.\n‘Nano. Which is closer? Zhumadian or Datong city?’\nAccording to Marayun, Zhumadian and Datong city were the other two places the legacies were hidden.\nHe decided that getting the two subordinates would be better because there was a possibility the MS group could find them.\n[I will mark it on the map.]\nThe locations of the two were marked in augmented reality.\nDatong city was located to the left of Beijing city, so he’d have to go up a long way north.\n‘It would be better to stop at Zhumadian city and then to Datong.’\nHu Bong, unaware of this, approached Chun Yeowun and asked.\n“Lord. Hm, where are we going first?”\n“Zhumadian.”\n“Huh? Where is that?”\nThere was no way Hu Bong could know the names used in the current time.\n“To the south of Henan.”\n“Ah…”\nHu Bong couldn’t help but be disappointed.\nFrom that reaction alone, Chun Yeowun could guess that the person who was hibernating there was Baekgi.\n“Hu Bong.”\n“Yes… Lord.”\n“I think it is a good thing that you have grown strong.”\n“Sorry?”\nHu Bong understood right away why Chun Yeowun said such a thing.\nChun Yeowun had a nano suit on and hugged Hu Bong as he flew into the sky.\nSwoosh!\n“Kuaaak!”\nWhen they crossed the sky at a speed of Mach 13, the impact of the air hitting the body was beyond imagination.\nHad it not been for Hu Bong’s regenerative power, he would have died right away.\n‘Zhumadian, it was said to be near the reservoir on the west.’\nHe definitely heard Marayun say that.\nIt was difficult to get to the place since it was outside the wall, but that was no problem for Chun Yeowun.\nAt least, that was what he thought.\nChun Yeowun and Hu Bong both arrived at the coordinates Marayun had mentioned with stiff faces.\n“Lord… didn’t you say that there is a reservoir here?”\nUnexpectedly, what should have been there was no more.\nThe place was devastated, as if it had been bombed.\n‘I heard that there was a huge underground cave near this reservoir.’\nThere was no cave, just a huge pit formed from the aftermath of the explosion.\nIf there was anything stranger, it was the huge hole in the ground that seemed to be made to bring something out.\n“L-Lord. What happened to Baekgi?”\nHu Bong’s expression darkened.\nHu Bong’s case seemed to have been a lucky one.\nNo one could know what could happen when one was hibernating inside the mountains for long.\n“Wait.”\nAs the problem couldn’t be solved by jumping to conclusions, Chun Yeowun asked Nano to investigate the site.\nNano was capable of ultrasound detection and lipid analysis.\nNano’s voice echoed in Chun Yeowun’s mind.\n[Ultrasound detection results. No site has been found. What is believed to be an underground cave seems to have sunken due to the explosion.]\n‘If we dig here, will we find something?’\n[Nothing is present according to the ultrasound.]\nThe image below the ground was shown to Chun Yeowun in augmented reality.\nAs Nano said, not even human remains could be found.\n‘Just what happened here?’\n[As a result of analysis of shape and geology of the ground, traces of lava flow are found.]\n‘What?’\nLava.\nIt means the magma which is ejected to the surface.\nThe hot lava is a phenomenon that usually comes when a volcano erupts.\nThe west side of Zhumadian was hilly but definitely not a volcanic area.\n‘There are traces of lava flow in here?’\n[Yes.]\nIt was Nano’s analysis, but it felt hard to believe.\nNano added.\n[According to the analysis, the magma isn’t from earth.]\n‘Then?’\n[This is lava from the Gate.]\nIt was highly likely that they were traces of lava from the Gate.\nThere were three forms of Gates.\nOne of them was disaster type. These were occasionally occurring and were more devastating than a natural disaster on earth.\n‘Was Baekgi swept away by the lava when he was hibernating?’\nChun Yeowun looked at the lava.\nHowever, the pit at the hidden coordinates where Baekgi should’ve been hibernating showed signs of an explosion.\nAn explosion which seemed to have pushed aside the lava.\n‘If lava flowed through this point as it is…’\nThen lava should have entered the city behind.\nPerhaps to prevent that, the humans caused an explosion.\nHe concluded that the place where Baekgi was sleeping was caught up in the explosion.\n‘Baekgi was this easily beaten?’\nChun Yeowun looked at the vast pit.\nIf he really died here because of the explosion, then the wait of Baekgi for his Lord was so futile.\nGrunt!\nChun Yeowun clenched his fists. That was when Hu Bong approached him and said,\n“Lord. Could it be that someone coveted the Blood of the Dragon Turtle?”\n“What?”\nChun Yeowun frowned at those words.\nHu Bong was unaware of this time, so he guessed what he could think of.\nThe blood of the Dragon Turtle.\n“There was a vial of a spirit beast blood where Baekgi was kept?”\nIn the place where Hu Bong was hibernating, there was a vial holding the blood of Flame Qilin.\nIt was Chun Yeowun who never asked about it.\n“Well, we kept them in case we woke up from hibernating and were unable to recover.”\nIt was for their own selves.\nAfter Chun Yeowun disappeared, the people in the Cult studied the blood of the spirit beasts.\nOne of the things they discovered was that even the cut-off body of the person who could absorb the blood of the spirit beast and embody it, could recover.\n“It was like that.”\nThe blood of the spirit beast was to promote their recovery from hibernation.\nFor Hu Bong and the others who decided to hibernate, it was a recovery drink, but for the other Murim people, it was an elixir from heaven.\nThat’s why Hu Bong ended up thinking that.\n“Hu Bong. Now that you say…”\nChun Yeowun, who was trying to explain what happened to Hu Bong, stopped.\nAnd then looked at the ultrasound map in augmented reality.\n“Lord?”\nChun Yeowun didn’t answer his call and kept looking at the map.\nHe found out something.\n‘Ah! Right!’\nAs a result of taking a closer look.\n“Hu Bong, follow me.”\nPhat!\nChun Yeowun jumped into the pit.\n“Uh? L-Lord!”\nHu Bong hurriedly followed him.\nThe pit, which was the result of an explosion, was so massive in depth and surface.\nChun Yeowun, who reached the pit, stopped and reached out his arm.\nThe hardened soil began to dig.\nPapapapk!\n“L-Lord, what are you doing?”\n“Take a good look.”\nHe couldn’t have done it faster because Chun Yeowun was trying to calm himself.\nAfter digging a few meters, Chun Yeowun stopped.\nThe artificially-made cave shook, and something came out.\n“Uh? Altar!”\nHu Bong recognized it.\nThe same altar which Hu Bong was placed on during hibernation.\nThe altar was made of sapphire.\n“The altar is unharmed.”\n“The altar is in good condition, but here is no sign of Baekgi and the vial.”\n“Ah!”\nHu Bong’s eyes widened.\nIt was then that he understood why Chun Yeowun had done this.\nIf everything was destroyed, but the altar was still safe and unscratched, then it meant that Baekgi was safe somewhere else.\n“Did Baekgi wake up?”\n“I don’t know.”\nAll they knew was that Baekgi wasn’t hurt in the explosion.\nThere was no way of knowing if he woke by himself or had fallen into someone else’s hand.\nThere were no traces on the altar which could have given an answer.\n‘Huh?’\nAt that time, Chun Yeowun saw that the sapphire altar was partially cut off.\nLooking closer, it seemed to be a man-made cut.\n‘The place which is cut…’\nIt wasn’t a smooth cut with a sword, but an irregular cut.\n‘To be cut like this means…’\nWhen Chun Yeowun raised his hand up, an invisible sword appeared.\nOf course, the sapphire would be cut very easily with the invisible sword, but Chun Yeowun was using another method.\nDrrr!\nThe sword trembled.\nThe invisible sword was imitating the ultra-vibrating sword.\nClash!\nChun yeowun brought it down to the altar, making the sapphire altar split in half.\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun pulled back the sword and looked at the cut section on the altar.\nHu Bong noticed it too.\n“L-Lord! The traces are the same. How did you do this?”\nThe microscopic irregularities were the same.\nAt that, Chun Yeowun narrowed his eyes.\n“Ultra-vibrating sword… those guys again.”\nIn this era, there was only one group of people who had the tech of ultra-vibrating swords.\n“MS Group!”\n“MS Group? What is that?”\n“I think they took away Baekgi.”\nChun Yeowun was convinced that they were involved in this.\n“How dare they! Lord! Let’s find them right away and punish them! Let’s bring back Baekgi!”\nHu Bong was furious at it.\nIt felt like if given a chance, he would tear them all down.\nBut Chun Yeowun shook his head.\n“Huh? W-why? Lord! Without Baekgi, you may not be able to return to our time.”\nBaekgi had one of the three codes.\nHu Bong was worried about Baekgi, but even more concerned that Chun Yeowun wouldn’t be able to go back.\n“Hu Bong, calm down.”\n“What? But without Baekgi...!”\n“Just tracking back is a waste of time. We need to find clues.”\nIf the MS Group was an exposed organization, it would have been easy to find them, but they were strongly hidden.\nLooking for the MS Group was like searching for a needle in a haystack.\nIt would take up too much time.\n“Ah! I hope they come to us directly. We can catch and kill them.”\n“Ho-uh?”\nChun Yeowun’s eyes shone at Hu Bong’s grumbling.\n“That is a good idea.”\n“Huh?”\nChun Yeowun smiled at the furious Hu Bong.\n“Right. We don’t have to search for them.”\nAfter receiving a commission from Chun Woo-kyung, they aimed for Chun Yeowun.\nIt was likely that the MS Group had covert ties with other organizations too.\nAnd if Chun Yeowun could use that, he could pull them out.\n“Hu Bong.”\n“Yes! Lord.”\n“I promise you. I will make it possible for you to slaughter each one of them with your own hands.”\n“Yes!”\nHu Bong stopped grumbling after that.\nBecause the Chun Yeowun he knew was a man who would definitely get that done.\n“Before that, Mun Ra-yeong…. No, your wife, we need to go for her.”\n“L-Lord! Let’s hurry then.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, Hu Bong wanted to hurry.\nBecause Baekgi was gone, he was worried that his wife might be in trouble too.\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun wore his suit and spread his arms.\n“Come on.”\n‘Ugh…’\nHu Bong, who had already experienced the tremendous speed once, hesitated for a moment.\nBut what could he do?\nDeeply frowning, he went and hugged Chun Yeowun.\nOnce again, Chun Yeowun flew into the sky.\nSwosh! Phut!\n“Kwaak!”\nDatong city.\nIt was a city in the northern part of the Shanxi province, west of Beijing.\nChun Yeowun, who almost reached it, frowned.\n‘What is this?’\nHe was still several kilometres away, but he could feel an energy wave spreading from Datong city.\n‘Gate?’\nSuch an energy wave could only be felt when a Gate was open.\nThe energy which shook the space was stronger and gloomier than the ones he felt before.\nIt wasn’t this strong when he fought the Shivaras.\nBang! Bang!\nAs they got closer, the sound of some heavy shelling could be heard.\nIt sounded like explosions.\nChun Yeowun, who thought something weird was happening, lowered the speed and gave Nano an order.\n‘Nano. Enlarge the field of view.’\n[Understood.]\nThe field of view on one side of the eye was enlarged.\nHowever, on the outside of the wall, a huge number of tanks surrounded and fired into the air.\n[PGZ-15 aircraft tank.]\nIt was a tank specialized for air.\nThe tanks’ guns were busy firing into the air above the wall. But it was obvious that they were aiming for something.\n‘What is it?’\nIt was strange.\nIt was invisible to the naked eye, but something was surely there.\nBang! Bang!\nAs he was wondering, he saw something like a hazy smoke fly in the air.\n‘What is that thing?’\nIt left a trail of white particles with each movement.\nLike a ghost.",

      "content": "Chapter 85: S-class hazard entity (1)\nThe Defense garrison was located about 1 km outside the Datong city wall.\nThe most central part was the Command Situation control room.\nDozens of monitors were showing the status of each wall in real-time.\n“Commander. Ten units escaped from the B-13 barrier, damaging 3 aircraft tanks and injuring 30 men.”\n“Commander. The searchlight on the D-5 barrier was broken, and a request for assistance came in.”\nThe monitoring officers were delivering reports from each unit and relaying them to the commander.\nA moustached middle-aged man was sitting at the top of the barracks tent.\nHe was the brigade commander, Major General Mak Wu-cheong.\nGeneral Mak Wu-cheong was sweating at the information he was hearing every second.\nHe was a competent commander who blocked the Gates for 40 years, but this was his first time encountering such a terrifying situation.\n‘I am going crazy.’\nNormally, the role of the National Guard was to block the enemies from infiltrating the wall.\nBut this time, the situation changed.\nThis time, they were all blocking the entity of the Gate from coming out of the barrier.\n‘Damn it! Why did the Gate open in the middle of the city?’\nThe worst place for a Gate to open.\nThe Gates never open in the same place.\nThe Gates always moved positions little by little, but a situation where the Gate position changed entirely was scarce.\nAnd that was happening right now.\nTwo days ago, exactly 29 hours ago, due to the Gate opening in the southwest of the wall, Datong city was unable to respond properly.\nThe inside of the wall was overflowing with ghost-like things.\nIt was a horror.\nDespite hiding in bunkers, people were scared out of their wits.\nThe statistics were still not available, but it was estimated that there were more than a million casualties.\nFinding survivors seemed hard.\n‘The only thing the military can do is to stop them from coming out entirely.’\nEveryone felt so powerless.\nThere was no way to kill the hazard entities.\nThe National Guard research team was looking for weaknesses, but they haven’t found any.\n“30 aircraft tanks have been destroyed, and more than 5 hundred people from the National Guard have been killed. Reinforcements must arrive quickly.”\nThe Defense forces from the 5 close-by cities had already sent reinforcements. They were also in a dangerous state, so they couldn’t send their entire force.\n“Commander!”\nWhen the commander was in thought, someone entered the barracks of the control room.\nIt was the sergeant guarding the outside.\n“Haven't the reinforcements arrived?”\n“The 3 teams of the Murim Association from Beijing, Shijiazhuang and Baoding have arrived.”\n“Is that so?”\nMak Wu-cheong couldn’t help but feel disappointed.\nIt was good that the Murim people had come to help them, but what they needed more than anything now, was military support.\nBut he felt glad that they came anyway.\n“Guide them to the barracks where the secondary support team is stationed.”\nHowever, the sergeant's report wasn't done.\n“Commander. And it seems like the Ministry of Security and Intelligence Agency have come with the Beijing Murim team.”\n“What?”\nCommander Mak Wu-cheong jumped out of his seat.\nThe Ministry of Security was the core department under the State Council, including the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Public Security and Civil Government and Judiciary.\nAnd the head of that important department had come to where the Gate was open without even contacting him.\n‘Oh shit.’\nHe grabbed his head, feeling pain.\nHe knew why.\n‘It is dangerous, so I asked them to wait.’\nBut they came.\nAs he was about to leave the barracks, a man in his late fifties, wearing a protective suit with pale eyes and wrinkles on his face, entered.\n“Commander Mak!”\n“Director!”\nHe was Cho Hyung-mu, the director of Internal security.\nCommander Mak Wu-cheong hurriedly saluted the person.\nThis man wasn’t his direct superior, but if he was higher than the head of State Council.\nHowever, the director Cho Hyung-mu of the ministry of Internal Security, raised his voice as soon as he entered.\n“Commander Mak. What are you even doing now? Why hasn’t the rescue operation been carried out yet!”\n“Director. It wasn’t…”\n“What do you mean! My son and daughter-in-law are in a dangerous place right now. I don’t see the son and wife of Cho Hyun-mu, the head of Internal security!”\nCommander Mak Wu-cheong couldn’t help but feel embarrassed.\nThe Gate opened and this man was asking to send a team to rescue his son and his wife.\n“Aren’t the Murim Association teams being kept on stand-by too?”\n‘Who told him?’\nMak Wu-cheong frowned.\nHe seemed to know that the second support team of the Murim association was on stand-by.\n“Director. We put them on stand-by because we don’t know the weakness of those entities yet…”\n“Are you going to stand back and keep watching till then?”\nHe couldn’t answer that.\n‘Even though he has no idea what’s going on, he comes in and screams, not knowing how dangerous an S-class entity is!’\nMak Wu-cheong, who was losing his patience, spoke in a slightly stronger voice.\n“Director… the gatekeepers and Murim warriors who came with us and went inside, lost contact with us within 30 minutes after entering. As a commander, I need to be careful…”\n“Ahh! Commander Mak is saying that it doesn’t matter if civilians die or not. Even if you close the Gate as soon as possible, you are done.”\nIn the end, Mak Wu-chang gave up.\nAs a soldier, he didn’t have the knack to argue with politicians.\nIn front of the barracks.\nAround 400 Murims warriors had gathered in protective suits.\nThey were from the Murim association of 8 cities around Datong city.\nHearing that an S-class Gate opened, the elites who came in were all above Super Master level.\n8 cities, including Tianjin city.\nEven before the Gate, Peng Neung-gyeom, descendant of the Hebei Peng clan, have always supported others.\n‘A lot of people seem to have gathered. Hehehe.’\nOpportunities to target an S-class core were rare.\nDespite the danger, the Murim people flocked to it like moths to fire.\nAnd there are some famous ones here.\n[The fact that Hong Pal-son, the head of Beijing Murim Association, is here, is the most shocking.]\nThe most surprising one.\nNormally, the branch heads of the Association never stray too far from their areas.\nHowever, the S-class core was a different story.\nBu Do-kyun of the Six Life Insurance was also there.\nPeng Neung-gyeom, who was looking around, couldn’t hide his shock when he saw someone.\n‘That person?’\nThey were wearing hazmat suit helmets, but he would never forget that face.\n‘The monster from Shenyang city Gate?’\nChun Yeowun.\n‘Did he come with the 3rd support team?’\nNo way.\nChun Yeowun wanted to fly above, but due to the aircraft tanks moving around, he couldn’t.\nAt the same time, he discovered the Murim warriors gathered in the place.\nSeeing that they were heading into a war, he hid among them.\nFeeling the gaze on him, Chun Yeowun looked at the man.\n‘Descendant of Peng clan.’\nHe thought that it was some unknown person staring at him.\nBut he recognized the person.\nHowever, since he didn’t have much interest in him, he turned away.\nThe only objective Chun Yeowun had was to enter Datong city without being noticed.\n“Lord. Ugh… these clothes… are damn shitty.”\nHu Bong, who was next to him, looked out of place as his body felt tight with the protective suit.\nIt was because he was wearing a suit that didn’t fit his size.\nChun Yeowun focused on the man who was explaining the strategy instead of listening to Hu Bong’s grumbling.\n“Use the goggles on the helmet, and you can see the entity. Never take it off.”\nThe special goggles used by the National Guard.\nIt was equipped with a function to distinguish the ultraviolet wavelengths.\n“We will tell you the precautions before entering.”\nThe officer of the National Guard turned on a large monitor and began his briefing.\n“This is the photo of the hazard entity.”\nWhisper!\n‘What the hell?’\n‘It looks like a ghost.’\nIt had a form similar to that of a human. It walked on two legs.\nHowever, everything else was blurry, and every time it moved, it left footprints like particles.\nThe Murim warriors mumbled as they saw it.\n“First, they can go through walls about a meter thick. We do not even know where and when they will come out and so be very careful.”\n“If it can pass through walls, then won’t our attacks just pass through?”\nA warrior raised his hand and asked.\nAt that, the man shook his head and pointed to the entity.\n“It was the second thing I was about to say. It can’t go through everything. Things like physical attacks and bullets don’t work. But it was said to have a high level of energy.”\n“High level of energy?”\n“According to the first team's last words, they said that when high-level heat energy is used, it would be effective.”\nWhich meant, only heat-induced energy attacks could work.\nFortunately, since most Murim people were of higher level, they could use sword energy.\n“However, even if energy and heat were used, they don’t feel much pain, and if they are still left in one piece, it can continue to move, so be careful.”\n“Huh?”\nWhich meant that it had to be shredded or crushed.\nAnd that was the most difficult thing to do.\n“The third is to avoid any direct close contact with them. Never let them touch you.”\nBeep!\nThe man pressed a button, and a photo was shown.\nThe person who touched that entity looked frozen dead.\n“It is an entity which goes past humans too, and if it does, you will die of hypothermia. The warriors are no exception, so if in any chance they come for you, avoid touching you and move away.”\nSilence reigned.\nTill a moment ago, they were all interested in the S-class core, but this warning was so scary that they went stiff.\nOnly now did they realize why the 1st team never survived.\nBeing assigned to fight an S-class was the worst.\n“That is what we managed to find out so far. If you could learn anything new, please let us know through the radio right away.”\nThe information they had now was the cost of countless sacrifices in the last 29 hours.\nNow, the new batch had to find out further information.\n“If you don’t have any questions, this briefing…”\n“The entity. What should we call this entity?”\nA Murim warrior asked.\nMost hazard entities were named once discovered.\n“This is the first time such a being has ever appeared in the world, so it hasn’t been announced, but we call it Ghost.”\nGhost.\nLiterally meant Ghost.\nThere was no word more appropriate than this.\nAnd the soldier added.\n“Any more questions? So, this concludes the briefing. We ask those who are called to remain in the last group and the others to depart in the vehicles to the site.”\nWith that, the man called out a list of names.\nMost of them were warriors of the Beijing Murim Association.\n‘The diversion…’\nChun Yeowun, who heard the conversation inside the main barracks, knew why this was happening.\nThese people were a special team made to rescue the son and wife of the Internal Security director.\nIf the other Murims found out about this, they would hate the Defense.\n“Come this way.”\nWhoo!\nThe others headed to the military truck, which was prepared in advance.\n“Hu Bong.”\n“Whoa! Lord. Try this one. We can even see the other side of the water!”\nHu Bong put on the goggles and looked around.\nHu Bong, a person from a thousand years in the past, surely was shocked at this new era.\nAnd this was a natural reaction.\n“Stop it and let’s go.”\n“Alright. Lord… Woah! Lor-Lord! There is a strange-looking wagon moving without horses! How the hell!”\nTatatak!\n“Ump! Ump!”\nWith the constant words, Chun yeowun turned irritated and sealed his mouth. Thanks to that, Hu Bong kept his mouth shut until they entered the city.\n30 seater military trucks moving in four directions.\nTo the wall from the north, east, south and west side.\nSince they weren’t sure where the Alpha was, they were sending people in all directions.\nAs they got closer, the Murim people began to behave weirdly, some were nervous and some...\n‘S-class core.’\nPeople with greed for the core.\nNot being scared, they even declared that they would get the S-class core.\n“Idiots.”\nThere were people who looked at them and clicked their tongues.\nOne of the people who didn’t like them was Oh-hyeon, the branch head of Tianjin Murim Association.\n“Huhuhu, leave them.”\n“Senior Peng!”\n“Everyone has different ways of overcoming their fear.”\n“Is the senior afraid?”\nOh-hyeon looked at Peng Neung-gyeom, who was still looking calm.\nAccording to the briefing, the Ghost was scary and something they had never tackled before.\nIf the entities were this scary, he couldn’t even think how terrifying the Alpha would be.\n“I trust senior.”\nThe reason Oh-hyeon chose this truck was because of that.\nAs far as he knew, Peng Neung-gyeom was one of the top three Murim warriors who had come here.\nHe believed that if he stuck with him, he could survive.\n“Don’t trust this old man.”\n“Hh?”\n“But your choice isn’t wrong.”\nPeng looked at someone sitting in the front.\nIt was Chun Yeowun.\nJust like Oh-hyeon did, he got on this truck because of someone.\n“Someone you know? Looks young. Very young.”\nIn Oh-hyeon’s eyes, Chun Yeowun was like a little kid.\nHe couldn’t understand why Peng Neung-gyeom was so interested in him.\n“You will find out soon.”\n“Is that so?”\nOh-hyeon didn’t care much about those words.\nBut as soon as the truck passed the front gate of the wall, the meaning was well understood.\nClank!\nAs soon as the gate opened and the truck entered, a number of Ghosts, which were trying to come out of the wall, rushed to the truck.\nShhh!\nThey moved so fast that the ones inside the truck couldn’t even see where they were coming and going.\nThere was no way that ordinary people could have survived.\n“Damn it!”\nPush!\nThe driver accelerated the truck to shake off Ghosts.\nThe road on the inside of the wall was flat, so it was easy to escape.\nHowever.\nSrrr!\nThe speed of Ghosts chasing the truck was too fast.\n“They will catch up.”\n“Everyone! Get ready!”\nSrn! Srrr!\nThe Murim warriors in the back of the truck pulled out their weapons and induced energy into them.\n“Haa!”\nSlash!\nThey used sword energy slashes to block the Ghosts from catching up.\nThanks to that, the truck accelerated and gradually moved away from Ghosts.\n“Done.”\n“We lost them for now.”\nThe Murim warriors' faces turned a little calm.\nBut a problem arose.\n“Eikk!”\nThe driver yelled.\nAnd the Murim people looked ahead to see what happened.\n“N-No…”\n“Ghost!”\nMany Ghosts were flying in the direction the truck was going.\nAt first glance, it seemed like there were hundreds of them.\nGhosts ahead and Ghosts behind.\n‘W-what should I do?’\nThe driver was confused and turned pale when someone said.\n“Keep going.”\n“Sorry?”\nThe driver was shocked, when someone got onto the top of the bonnet of the truck.\nIt was Chun Yeowun.\n‘W-what is he planning on doing?’\nOh-hyeon looked at the man with shocked eyes.\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun stretched out his hand towards the front.\nAnd.\nWheik!\nHundreds of flaming swords appeared around the moving truck.\nSuch a majesty made the fear of Ghosts forgettable.\n“W-what is that?”\nThe eyes of the Murim warriors, including Oh-hyeon, widened at the majestic scene.",

      "content": "Chapter 86: S-class hazard entity (2)\nWheik!\n“W-what is that?”\nThe driver couldn’t hide his shock at the flame swords swirling around the truck.\n“Don’t concern yourself with that and keep driving.”\nShh!\nChun Yeowun grabbed one sword with his outstretched hand and shook it lightly.\nAt that moment, the hundreds of flame swords around the truck went right for the Ghosts flying towards them.\nPapapak!\nThe flame swords, which were made of pure heat, swept away the Ghosts.\nWhere the flame sword swept through, there wasn’t even a trace of what was hit.\nThis was like watching a tyrant be born.\n“Senior Peng…. W-who is that guy?”\nOh-hyeon, the clan leader of the Oh Sword clan, was shocked at the sight.\nIt was the same with Peng Neung-gyeom.\nHe knew that the man was strong, but this exceeded his expectations.\n‘He used all those swords with flame? All flame swords? Is he even human?’\nHundreds of flame swords moved at Chun Yeowun’s will in an instant.\nHe knew about Air Swords, but never knew that so many swords could be handled simultaneously.\nWheik!\nThe flame swords left a trail behind them as they moved.\nThe flame swords devastatingly crushed the Ghosts.\nThe word S-class hazard entity looked meaningless in front of Chun Yeowun’s power.\n‘What the hell am I seeing now?’\n‘He isn’t human.’\nThe Murim people were all bewildered.\nIt was so overwhelming that their overwhelming fear for the Ghosts started to subside.\n“Kya! Indeed, my Lord!”\nHu Bong was the only one who looked at it with proud eyes.\nChun Yeowun in action. He hadn’t seen that in a long time, so seeing it made a chill run down his spine.\n‘Hehe. This is the Demon God of the Great Sky Demon order. You stupid idiots.’\nHu Bong couldn’t speak, so he kept thinking all sorts of things he wanted to say.\nThanks to Chun Yeowun’s overwhelming power, the military truck overcame the crisis and was able to move.\nThe other warriors kept their mouths shut.\nIn front of a monster like Chun Yeowun, they couldn’t help but be silent.\nAnd that was the case with Oh-hyeon too.\n‘I see why Senior Peng got on this truck.’\nThere was no reason why anyone wouldn’t choose the safest military truck.\nMeanwhile, the truck ended up entering the innermost wall.\n“Thank God. I don’t see any Ghosts.”\n“Phew, I can finally breathe.”\nThe warriors, who were tense seconds ago, took deep breaths.\nThe area close to the barrier was overflowing with Ghosts.\nHowever, as they went inside and drove further into the roads, they couldn’t see any Ghosts around.\nBut.\n“Ahh…”\nHorrendous sights were awaiting them.\nExploded cars.\nOverturned vehicles.\nAnd the most horrifying sight was the dead frozen bodies, white as frost.\n‘Horrible.’\n‘How can this…’\nAll of this was the result of the Gate opening inside the barrier.\nIt looked like the end of the world.\n-Click! This is the commander unit. I am lieutenant Lee Ho-sung. West team 1! Can you hear me?\nAt that moment, the voice of the lieutenant who did the briefing was heard.\nOriginally, the team leader was supposed to be Peng Neung-gyeom, but everyone ended up looking at Chun Yeowun.\nEven Peng Neung-gyeom.\nSwish!\nWhen Chun Yeowun waved his hand with an annoyed expression, Peng Neung-gyeom nodded and then answered.\n“We can hear you.”\n-Haa… that is good. Commander, West Team 1 has entered safely.\nAt the lieutenant’s words, all the warriors were puzzled.\nIt was as if the lieutenant was saying the other teams had faced some trouble, so Peng Neung-gyeom asked.\n“Was there any problem with the other teams?”\n-The two teams that had entered from the east were entirely wiped out.\nAt those words, the faces of warriors darkened.\nThe fact that two teams were annihilated meant that 60 warriors were dead.\n“Sigh…”\nThe strongest person in the east team was at the end of the Super Master level.\nIt was weak compared to the other teams, but annihilation was still shocking.\n-The other teams weren’t that lucky either.\nJust as they entered, the other teams were attacked by waves of Ghosts too.\nHearing the calm voice of the lieutenant, they guessed that there were loss of lives in the other teams.\nThe lieutenant asked.\n-Any casualties in the team?\n“None yet.”\n-What?\nHe seemed shocked.\n-No one hurt?\n“Fortunately, no casualties or injuries on our side.”\n-That… that’s amazing!\nThe lieutenant was genuinely shocked.\nThey were the only team with zero casualties.\n“It was all…”\nPeng Neung-gyeom tried to make it known that Chun Yeowun was the one responsible but.\n[Do not say anything.]\nHe stayed silent at Chun Yeowun’s warning.\nIt was necessary to gain fame and name for the revival of the Sky Demon Order, but he didn’t want his information to be passed to the government.\n-All?\n“Nothing. We were all extremely lucky.”\n-You are being humble. Anyway, it is good that all team members are doing well. Could you explore the coordinates we are sending you?\n-Beep!\nThe coordinates were marked on the goggles.\nPeng Neung-gyeom asked.\n“Why this place?”\n-…we have information that the Alpha object could be at those places. Please explore.\n“Hmm… I get it.”\nPeng Neung-gyeom wasn’t convinced, but he just agreed for now.\nIf there was an Alpha entity, it was right to head to the place.\nHowever, since they weren’t sure of how the situation inside the wall was, he wondered if he had to go for the Alpha right away.\n‘Any survivors?’\nThere was no way to know.\nIn any case, it seemed better to follow the instructions of the Defense, so instead of wandering, they went searching for the Alpha.\n“Hm, hm, what about you?”\nTurning off the radio, Peng Neung-gyeom asked for Chun Yeowun’s opinion.\nHe respected him as the strongest there.\nHowever, the words which came out were unexpected.\n“Only till here.”\n“Huh? What do you mean?”\n“Literally. You can go to the coordinates.”\n“There could be an Alpha entity! You don’t want it?”\n“Right.”\nNot just Peng Neung-gyeom, but the others, too, were shocked when Chun Yeowun said that he wouldn’t come.\nThey thought that if Chun Yeowun came along, then they would be able to survive.\nHowever, when they heard his words, they lost all hope.\nOh-hyeon hurriedly stepped up.\n“If you don’t come, what will the Murim people here do?”\nIt was he who wanted to let Chun Yeowun do all the work.\nChun Yeowun tried to get off the truck with Hu Bong when they complained.\n“Isn’t it irresponsible to neglect a mission and derail?”\nAnxiety and dissatisfaction.\nSomeone grabbed that man’s throat.\nClench!\n“Kuak!”\n“Yah. Who do you think you are talking to? Huh?”\nIt was Hu Bong.\nThe murim warrior who was caught was a Super master level warrior, but he was never trapped in such a speed.\nAs soon as he was caught by Hu Bong, he felt heat spread in his body.\n“Kuak… Let go!”\nHu Bong spoke with enraged eyes.\n“Why? A bastard like you who insulted my Lord needs to have his neck broken…”\n“Let go, Hu Bong.”\n“Huh? But this guy just…”\n“He isn't worth killing.”\nWith that, Hu Bong released the grip.\nThanks to that, the Murim people no longer tried to stop Chun Yeowun from leaving.\n“A warrior? expecting someone to protect you? How pathetic!”\nThey really weren’t worth killing.\nChun Yeowun clicked his tongue and disappeared along with Hu Bong to the northwest direction.\nThe faces of the warriors on the truck were full of despair.\nChun Yeowun, who got out, went straight to the coordinates that Marayun had given him.\nHis original purpose was to wake Mun Ran-yeong, who was hibernating.\nThe coordinates were to the northwest of the Datong city, where mountains made of sand and stones were concentrated.\nThanks to the tremendous movement speed, they reached the place in less than 30 minutes.\nA hidden cave emerged as they entered through the rugged place.\n“Hehehe.”\nOn the way, Hu Bong giggled as he thought of seeing his wife.\nHowever, as they entered, the smile disappeared.\nThey hadn’t even gone halfway in, and the cave had collapsed.\n“No way!”\nSince they had already seen that Baekgi was nowhere to be found, Hu Bong was anxious and scared.\nThere was no ice found or Ice qi felt in the cave.\n“L-Lord! It couldn’t be that the MS people took her?”\nHu Bong’s face turned red.\nHe was so furious he jumped to conclusions.\n“Hmm.”\nChun Yeowun looked at the collapsed cave.\nIt didn’t seem to have collapsed due to an external shock.\n‘Nano?’\n[Wind is blowing inside. It isn’t entirely filled.]\n‘Right?’\nHe had the same thoughts.\n“Hu Bong, look at this.”\n“Yes.”\nChun Yeowun reached out to the stones blocking the way.\nThe stones were shaking because of the energy which was being induced and then started to move.\nWhen a few large stones were moved, the passage was seen again.\n“Oh!! The cave!”\n“Let’s go.”\nThey entered through the cave.\n“Uh? Lord, over there.”\nThere were things scattered on the floor.\nIt was bones.\nWhen they got closer and looked, the skeletons seemed charred.\nShhh!\nWhen Chun Yeowun gently shook his hand, the soot moved away from the bones.\nMost of the skeletons had blows to the ribs and other parts, and the bones were cracked or crushed.\n‘This?’\nChun Yeowun, who examined that, smiled, making Hu Bong ask.\n“L-Lord, why are you smiling?”\nChun Yeowun asked.\n“These damages were caused by Demon Dragon technique.”\nThe Demon Dragon technique belonged to the Demon Dragon clan.\nAnd that was the clan to which Mun Ran-yeong belonged.\nA steel mill to the southwest of Datong.\nNumerous traces were visible within the sight.\nBodies that were believed to have died when fleeing.\nSshhh!\nThere were still many Ghosts floating around in the factory, creating a gloomy atmosphere.\nHowever, there was one place where the Ghosts didn’t go.\nIt was where the furnace of the forge was on.\nAs the factory was operating, the furnace was on, and the Ghosts didn’t even approach that place which was hotter than anything else.\nBut it didn’t seem like that would last long.\n“Damn it!”\nA man in his mid-30s wearing a grey suit cursed.\n“Stop cursing. I am becoming more worried because of you.”\nA woman in her fifties yelled at him.\nAt that, the man in the suit shouted.\n“You? Ha! Even a cleaning lady is yelling at me!”\nThe woman was also angry at the man, so she didn’t hold back her words.\n“What? Cleaning lady? Right! Enough words! Once the electricity runs out, the furnace will go out, then everyone should just die! I don’t even want to speak another word with you! You are like my son! What if you are the city hall planning director?”\nThe man was the head of the planning department of Datong City Hall.\nHe was Cho Hyung-man. The eldest son of the head of Internal Security.\n“What? You old lady must have lost your mind!”\nPuck!\n“Ack!”\nCho Hyung-man couldn’t stand it and hit the woman in her stomach.\n“How can this man!”\nThe other people around couldn’t stand it and tried to come at him, but a strong-looking man stopped them.\n“Everyone, calm down! How can we fight here?”\nAll the people were on the verge of breaking down.\n“What! What about that guy there? Are you taking sides as he is from the city hall?”\n“You said you were the deputy of the Murim department, but man! You are all the same.”\nThe man with a muscular physique was shocked at those words.\nHe was the deputy director of the Murim Department of Datong City hall, Han Jun-pyo, and he had no other option but to work for his boss.\n‘Everyone is on edge.’\nThe gathered people were all survivors.\n20 people.\nThey could survive as the Ghosts couldn’t come close to the furnace.\nHowever, once the city had cut off the electricity, the situation changed. The furnace slowly began to drop the heat.\n‘This guy is the biggest problem.’\nHan Jun-pyo understood the people’s words.\nIf he could, he would have hit Cho Hyung-man right away, but he couldn’t\nBesides.\n[Deputy director Han Jun-pyo, if you can protect me from this hellish place, I will tell my father to try and push you into the Murim department of the State council.]\nThat was the biggest reason.\nWhich was why he has been taking care of the man till now.\nBut with the way he was acting, the task was turning out to be more difficult.\n“Tch. Idiots.”\n“What?”\nCho Hyung-man kept throwing snarky comments at the people.\nNo matter how much the deputy director tried, the situation didn’t seem to calm down because of that. The kid was a golden spoon, so he always trampled on people.\nThere was one person who understood it well.\n[Secretary Mun. Calm the man.]\nAt Han Jun-pyo’s words, an attractive woman with short hair and a brown pencil skirt nodded.\nShe was the secretary of the planning department.\n“Chief. Please be patient.”\nAt her warm voice, the man looked proud.\nEven though he was a married man, he always made sure to dress well for her.\n“Ahh. Secretary Mun. Don’t worry. I don’t know what they will do, but I will make sure that secretary Mun gets out of this hellish place.”\nCho Hyung-man said.\nIt was hard to believe that this man’s wife had died just yesterday.\n“My father is the head of Internal Security. The national guards will come to rescue us, so trust…”\n“Kyaaak!”\nA scream which tore their ears.\nA woman with a pale face pointed somewhere as she kept screaming.\n“G-ghost!”\nShhh!\nA Ghost had appeared.\n“Damn it, already?”\nIt had been just two hours since the power went out, and the furnace was still hot.\nShocked, people turned around the factory to avoid the Ghosts.\nHan Jung-pyo tried to dissuade them.\n“Everyone! Please calm down! It is just one. If you keep making a fuss, more of them will come here!”\nThere was no way panicked people could ever calm down.\nThey were running to get as far as they could from the Ghost. Everyone trying to save their own lives.\n“C-Chief Han!”\n“Stay behind me.”\nShh!\nHan Jun-pyo drew his sword to protect the chief.\nHe had fought with the Ghosts several times as he brought the man here, so he knew that sword energy worked on them.\n“This guy!”\nClash!\nHan Jun-pyo slashed through the body of a flying Ghost.\nThe Ghost split in half and fluttered to the side as he scattered some white stuff.\n‘Done!’\nHan Jun-pyo shouted at the people around.\n“I killed the Ghost, so come…”\nShhh!\nAt that moment, the Ghost's split body passed through the body of Han Jun-pyo.\n“Uhh!”\nAs the Ghost passed, his body turned white.\nAs if he had been frozen to death.\nThud!\nHe fell.\n“D-deputy Han!”\nAt the man's death, only Cho Hyung-man kept on screaming. He wasn’t sad. He was just scared that no one was there to protect him anymore.\nSomeone shouted.\n“Look over there!”\n“Ghosts are coming in swarms!”\nShhh!\nThrough the walls, numerous Ghosts began to rush in.\nThere was no escape from Ghosts which were coming through all the walls.\nPeople were stunned.\nThey couldn’t even move when they saw so many of them approaching them.\n“Damn it! Shit! What the hell is my damn father doing!”\nUnable to overcome the fear, he kept cursing while crying.\nSecretary Mun, who was next to him, stepped forward.\n“Secretary Mun. what are you doing?”\nCho Hyung-man was puzzled as she boldly ripped the skirt which came down to her thighs and took her shoes mumbling.\n“Haa… I tried not to get involved.”\nWhoo!\nAt that moment, flames rose in her hands.\n“Huk!”\nCho Hyung-man’s mouth was hanging open at the sight.\nAs she stretched out her arms, flames shot out at the Ghosts like a flamethrower.\nWheik!\nThe Ghosts melted away without leaving any trace.\nIt would be more correct to say that Ghosts were being swept away.\nPak! Pak!\nEach time her hand moved, Ghosts disappeared.\n“Woahh!!!”\nPeople cheered.\nNo one cared why she had such an ability, but if she wasn’t there, they would die for sure.\n‘Haa…’\nHowever, her face was full of sweat.\nShe hadn’t used her power for such a long time that she was getting tired fast.\n‘Ugh!’\nSecretary Mun frowned.\nShe didn’t know why, but every time she used her power, she was in pain.\nHowever, she managed to deal with the Ghosts who entered the factory for now.\n“haaa… Ha…”\nShe gasped for air.\nShe was exhausted because she used Flame qi after a long time.\n“Secretary Mun!”\nSomeone hugged her from behind.\nIt was Cho Hyung-man.\n“if you had this strong ability, why didn’t you tell me? Secretary Mun? Were you a Gate Keeper?”\nCho Hyung-man was extremely happy about this.\nAfter Han Jun-pyo died, he was scared that this was going to be his end, but thanks to the woman, he thought he would live.\n“This… let go of me. Chief.”\nShe spoke weakly.\nInstead of letting her go, he whispered into her ear.\n“I think Secretary Mun is tired, so let’s sneak out. If we try to move with trash like them, we might die.”\nHe was speaking about abandoning people like it was a normal thing to do.\nHe thought that if he had her, then he could surely get out of the place safely.\nThat was when secretary Mun spoke coldly.\n“I told you to let go of me.”\n“Huh, I will hold you until you agree with me.”\nHe moved closer to her, speaking in a sly tone.\nTired, she was unable to push him away from her.\nGrab!\n“Euk!”\nSomeone suddenly grabbed the man by his head and lifted him up.\nFlustered, Cho Hyung-man tried to move, but the grip on his head kept getting stronger and stronger.\n“Kuuu!”\nAnd then, someone spoke.\n“Yah fucking bastard! What do you think you are doing holding someone else’s wife?”\n‘W-wife?’\nCho Hyung-man was the only one who was shocked.\nSecretary Mun, on the other hand, smiled brightly.\n“Bong Bong!”\nBong Bong was Hu Bong’s nickname.\nDespite being caught like that, Cho Hyung-man didn’t come to his senses and said.\n“Kuaak… what fucking… marriage…”\n“What are you spewing! You worm!”\nCrush!\nHu Bong’s finger dug into the man’s head.\n“Kuaaak!”",

Ugh.”\nShe shook her head.\nAlthough the man was trash, she didn’t want him to die in such a terrible way.\n“Honey.”\nHu Bong, who seemed like a lion as he split open the man’s head, was now pouting as he hugged the woman.\nShe was Mun Ran-yeong.\nHu Bong’s wife and the woman that served in the Cult for the longest time.\nShe patted Hu Bong and comforted him.\n“Seems like my hubby missed me a lot.”\nShe was in tears as she had missed Hu Bong.\nA familiar voice greeted her ears as the two of them were hugging each other.\n“Great Elder, it has been long.”\n‘!!!’\nMun Ran-yeong’s eyes widened.\nShe pushed Hu Bong aside and fell to the floor.\n“Lord Chun Ma!”\nThe voice belonged to Chun Yeowun.\nMun Ran-yeong, who was bowing her head, shouted with a shocked expression.\n“Great Elder Mun Ran…”\n“Shh!”\nChun Yeowun asked her to remain silent.\nShe wondered why, but then she noticed the survivors who were staring at them.\n“Ahh…”\nThe survivors were all civilians.\nIt meant that their identities shouldn’t be revealed.\nUnderstanding that, she changed her way of greeting to telepathy.\n[Great Elder, Mun Ran-yeong, greets the Chun Ma of the Great Sky Demon Order!]\nTears streamed down her face.\nShe was skeptical of the prophecy she was told, but when she saw the man right here in front of her very own eyes, she couldn’t stop the eruption of her emotions.\n“To see you like this after… this is really…”\nShe was choking on her words, unable to accept the reality in front of her.\nChun yeowun smiled brightly and lifted her up.\n“I heard everything from Hu Bong. This is late… but congratulations on your wedding.”\n“Ahh!”\nMun Ran-yeong blushed at it.\nShe, too, seemed to be conscious about her marriage to Hu Bong, who was a lot younger than her.\nHe was shocked too, but now Chun Yeowun didn’t care.\n“But how did you wake up?”\nHu Bong was curious too, so he added to Chun Yeowun’s question.\n“Right. Honey, how did you wake up?”\n‘Honey?’\nChun Yeowun frowned at his choice of words.\nHu Bong didn’t seem like he was talking to someone two hundred years older than him.\nAnd he continued.\n“When I saw the skeletons in the cave, it seemed like someone broke in. Honey, were you attacked?”\nThe cave she was hibernating in.\nChun yeowun and Hu Bong found more than 20 skeletons inside the cave.\nNano’s analysis said that the skeletons were two to three years old.\nMun Ran-yeong opened her mouth with a dark expression.\n“It is as you have guessed. I was forcibly woken up by a group of people.”\n“What bastards!”\nHu Bong's face contorted.\nIt was natural that he was reacting like this, since she was touched by someone else.\n“Lord, was it those MS people?”\nAt that question, Chun Yeowun looked at Mun Ran-yeong, and she shook her head.\n“MS? I don’t know what you are talking about, but I don’t know who they were.”\n“You don’t know them?”\nAt Chun yeowun’s question, she told them what had happened.\nExactly 2 years and 4 months ago.\nWhen Mun Ran-yeong came to her senses, her Dantian was touched, and someone was performing the Energy Absorption technique.\n“Energy Absorption technique?”\nIt was a technique to suck in the internal energy of the opponent.\nIt was impossible to absorb more than 10% of the energy, and even when used, the side effects were too severe in the era of Chun Yeowun too.\n“My energy was being absorbed, so I came back to my senses. Startled, I tried to push him away.”\nBut the man, who noticed it, stopped absorbing the energy and then broke her Dantian.\n“But I attacked him at the same time.”\nA man who absorbed her energy and then destroyed her Dantian.\nHowever, since she drank the blood of Flame Qilin, Mun Ran-yeong had excellent regenerative power and spirit energy within her.\nShe didn’t weaken right away and was able to inflict a blow to his heart.\nThe injured man tried to escape in panic.\n“I went after him.”\nMun Ran-yeong tried to catch him, but there was another man with him.\nHe interfered, and she lost the man in the process.\nWhat made things even worse was that she was losing consciousness.\nAs she lost more than half of her internal energy, her regenerative power weakened a lot.\n“When I woke up, I was in Datong city hospital.”\nShe said, looking at the dead body lying on the floor.\n“He found me by accident and took me to the hospital.”\nIn order to adapt to the world which was so different from hers, she pretended to have lost her memory and received the help of Cho Hyung-man.\nAnd the man who fell in love with her beauty, helped her a lot and gave her a job at the city hall.\nBecause of that, knowing his horrible personality, she tried to protect him as much as possible.\n“Khum!”\nHu Bong looked at the dead body with a troubled face.\nHe killed the person who helped his wife. It was natural that he was upset.\n“I was weak, and I couldn’t move.”\nMun Ran-yeong, who decided that unknown people could be targeting her, dyed her hair and mixed into society.\nIn her spare time, she tried to find anything regarding Chun yeowun or the Sky Demon order, but everything she heard was shocking.\n“They said that it was dissolved and disappeared.”\nMun Ran-yeong learned about what happened 27 years ago to the Cult.\nAnd her plan to meet Chun yeowun with their help was flushed away.\nLooking at Hu Bong, she said.\n“I tried to restore my strength to wake them up as the next best solution, but…”\nSince she lost more than half of her internal energy, and her regenerative power slowed, she couldn’t do anything.\nHowever, unable to give up, she concentrated on recovering her strength.\n“But, the Gate opened inside Datong city.”\n“Honey!”\nHu Bong was moved by the hardships she went through and hugged her again.\n“I will kill those bastards who made you like this with my own hands!”\n“Bong Bong…”\nHu Bong’s angry voice made her smile.\nIt was because she felt satisfied with meeting him.\n“Hu Bong. Move away for a second.”\n“Yes? Yes!”\nChun Yeowun, who made Hu Bong step back, looked at Mun Ran-yeong’s physical condition.\nA scan of Dantian.\nAs she said, it was damaged.\n‘It is natural that her internal energy is less.’\nIn addition to that, her Flame qi from the spirit beast has also weakened.\nThere was a high probability that the Flame qi was taken away too.\n“Hu Bong, give me that vial.”\n“Ah! Here.”\nHu Bong handed him the vial.\n“My Lord. This…”\nThere was no way she didn’t know what that vial was.\nIf it hadn’t been for the vial which was taken away, she would have recovered right away.\n“There is nothing wrong with Hu Bong, so Great Elder should use this.”\nWith this amount of blood, she would go back to her original strength.\nMun Ran-yeong was moved by Chun Yeowun’s words.\n“Ahh… Lord Chun Ma.”\n“I am going to make Hu Bong stand close for your protection, so you can recover.”\n“You mean now?”\n“If you don’t have strength, we won’t be able to move.”\nStartled, Hu Bong looked at Chun Yeowun.\nConsidering her current state, it was true that they couldn’t move, especially at the 13 Mach speed.\n“Honey… you could die too.”\n“?”\nShe didn’t know what Hu Bong was talking about, but she felt like she needed to recover.\nBut something was bothering her.\n“I… Lord. Before that, I think we should help them get out of Datong city.”\nThe survivors.\nThey had no power, and they wouldn’t be able to get out of this place.\nMun Ran-yeong felt compassion for them as they let her stay near the furnace.\nHu Bong looked at her and asked.\n“Lord, will that be fine?”\nIf they helped them, their plans would get delayed.\nChun Yeowun looked somewhere and said.\n“You don’t have to worry about that.”\n“Ah!”\nHu Bong understood what he meant.\nThe sound of approaching cars could be heard.\nSoon, a group of 40 people in suits entered the factory.\nThey were the Murim team that was given the rescue mission.\n“Wahhh!”\nThe survivors cheered when they saw them.\nIt was because they thought that the Defense had sent them to save them.\n“Is this the right place?”\n“Yes. The signal is close-by.”\nHowever, instead of taking care of the survivors, the Murim people were looking around for something else.\nThe survivors wondered what it was.\nBeep! Beep! Beep!\nAt that time, one of them looked at Chun Yeowun’s side.\nThe closer he moved to Chun Yeowun, the faster the beep.\nThe place where the man stood, was near the dead body of Cho Hyung-man.\n“Found it!”\n“Found it?”\nAt this shout, the warriors flocked to him.\n“How!”\nSomeone looked at Cho Hyung-man’s corpse.\nIt was Hong Pal-son, the head of the Beijing Murim Association.\nHe hurriedly ordered the people to take him back to the truck.\nAnd then he looked at Chun Yeowun and Hu Bong with anger-filled eyes.\n“Who did this?”\nHu Bong casually said.\n“Huh? I did that.”\n“Ha! You think you are so great!”\nHong Pil-son clicked his tongue at the way Hu Bong responded to him and gave orders to the warriors behind.\n“Arrest this man!”\n“Yes!”\nShh!\nTwo warriors drew their swords and approached Hu Bong.\nAs if a sign to say that they would attack if he resisted.\nChun Yeowun spoke to Hong Pal-son.\n“What do you think you are doing?”\n“He killed this person, and then spoke to me like this. He will be brought to trial!”\n“You don’t even ask why he did that?”\nFrowning at that, Hong Pal-son asked.\n“What reason could he have?”\n“This happened because he touched someone else’s wife.”\n“What?”\nHong Pal-son's expression turned stiff.\nAt that time, the middle-aged woman who was kicked by Cho Hyung-man shouted.\n“Right. He hugged and molested her!”\n“Molested?”\nHong Pal-son looked at Mun Ran-yeong, who seemed like a middle-aged woman.\nSeeing her skirt torn and pale face, he sighed and he held his forehead.\n‘This is insane.’\nHe mistook the reason she was dressed like that.\nIt did look like she had almost been sexually assaulted.\n‘Sigh.’\nFor Hong Pal-son, this was an embarrassing situation.\nThe Beijing Murim association was promised a huge sum of money if they rescued the son of Cho Hyung-mu.\nBut the son is dead and the reason was that he touched another person’s wife in public.\n‘What should I do?’\nIf this is the case, then all his hard work would have been for nothing. Instead of money, he would only get insults from Cho Hyung-mu.\nAbout 50 team members have died on their way here.\nHong Pal-son looked at the survivors.\n‘… nothing can be done.’\nSo many people saw Cho Hyung-man harassing a woman.\nIt would be a huge deal.\nHong Pal-son told the other warriors behind.\n“Don’t leave a single one behind. Kill all of them.”\nSrng!\nHis orders fell, and the warriors took out their weapons.\nKilling all the witnesses would hide the truth.\n“Huk!”\n“A-are you killing us? What do you mean?”\nThe survivors couldn’t hide their shock.\nHe thought that they had come to rescue them, but it seemed like a lie.\nHong Pal-son clasped his hands.\n“I am sorry. Please understand that this is unavoidable…”\n“Hu Bong.”\nChun Yeowun cut off his words and called for Hu Bong.\n“Yes! Lord!’\nChun Yeowun glanced at Hong Pal-son and the Murim warriors behind him.\n“Don’t leave a single one behind. Kill all of them.”\n“What?”\nAt those words, Hong Pal-son looked at Chun Yeowun in utter disbelief.",

      "content": "Chapter 88: Alpha Ghost (1)\n“Yes!”\nHu Bong shouted loudly.\nAt the thought of kicking some asses after a long time, he soared with determination.\n“Come on! Who should I start with?”\nHu Bong uttered.\nAnd then he pointed to the leader, Hong Pal-son, and added.\n“Hehe, aren’t you the head? Let’s start with you.”\nIt was as if he was giving the weaker ones some time to rest.\n“How dare you act this rude!”\nHong Pal-son was around 59 years old.\nHe was selected as the head of the Murim Association.\nHe had also taught many people martial arts.\nWith his outstanding talents, he managed to learn most of the essential techniques of the Forces of Justice formations. He was known to be the centre of the Forces of Justice.\nHe rose to the brink of greatness and was one of the few people known to be the next great warrior.\nHis pride was overflowing.\n“I guess you young people don’t know your place. There is no need to even think about asking you to understand.”\nLooking at his red face, anyone could tell how angry the man was.\n“Young…”\nChun Yeowun laughed openly at those words.\n“You!”\nIt was unforgivable for a man in his early twenties to talk back to a branch president of the Murim Association.\n“I am going to fix that bad habit of yours now.”\nTatak\nHong Pal-son quickly moved at Chun Yeowun, who was standing close to him.\nTrue to his skills, he moved in the fastest yet subtle way.\n‘He offended the head.’\n‘Tch tch, he brought this on himself.’\nThe warriors of the Beijing Murim Association shook their heads.\nBeing attacked by Hong Pal-son meant that the young man would suffer badly.\n‘Eighteen Palms of the Dragon!’\nFrom his right hand, a dominant force like the power of a dragon was unfolded.\nThe technique, which was meant to block the opponent's escape, aimed for the enemy’s blood points.\n“Take this!”\n“Where do you think you are going!”\nHu Bong stepped ahead with great force.\n“I should be the one dealing with this bastard.”\n“What? Bastard?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, Hong Pal-son turned even more enraged.\nChun Yeowun casually outstretched his hand.\n‘What is he trying to do…’\nCuk!\n‘Uh?’\nThe moment the palm touched the index finger.\nHong Pal-son’s movement halted right away.\nThe formation stopped.\nSince it depended on the lower body, he dug into the floor.\nBrrr!\n“W-what is this?”\n“He blocked the president with one finger!”\nThe Murim warriors, who were watching, couldn’t help but be shocked.\nHong Pal-son was trembling as his body was stopped when Chun Yeowun didn’t seem like he even did anything.\n“Who is the young one here?”\nChun Yeowun said.\n‘This guy… who the hell is this guy?’\nHong Pal-son was shocked.\nHe was stopped by one finger. Just one finger.\n‘Was he hiding his skills?’\nNo, that wasn’t the case.\nSince Chun Yeowun reached the highest point in martial arts, his energy could never be felt, unless his opponent was stronger than him.\n‘This is so embarrassing.’\nHong Pal-son’s face turned beet red.\nIt was shameful that his juniors were seeing him in such a miserable state.\n‘I can’t let this happen.’\nHe hurriedly pulled himself and took a step back, pretending to be bold.\nHe then clasped his hands.\n“I thought you were young, but you have exceeded my expectations. Could you tell me the name…”\nIt was a trick.\nPretending to be obedient, he would gather the energy and hit Chun Yeowun in the crotch.\nNo matter how strong a man was, he wouldn't be able to stand if that part of his body was hit.\nBut.\nBang!\n“Kuaaak!”\nChun Yeowun stepped on his foot before he could even move.\nHe stepped on it so hard that the foot dug into the floor.\nThe foot was crushed, not broken.\n“You troublesome old trash. Stop using your brain.”\n“Kuak… you… you…”\n“And your mouth too.”\nChun Yeowun reached for the mouth.\nPak!\n“Huk!”\nHis hand went past the helmet and grabbed the lips.\nIt was as if Chun Yeowun was trying to rip them out.\n“You can’t control this mouth, right?”\n“Ackkk”\nHong Pal-son tried to cut off Chun Yeowun's hands.\nBut Chun Yeowun had always been faster.\nWheik!\n“Kuak!”\nAs he kept grabbing the lips, he hit the body.\nKick! Thud!\n“Ackkk!”\nHong Pal-son, whose body was thrown to the floor, struggled to get up.\nChun Yeowun threw something to the floor.\nIt was the torn lips of Hong Pal-son.\nThe other warriors were at a loss for words.\n“Shittt!’\nHong Pal-son shouted.\n“Wha ar ydoi? Evey on atck hi!”\n‘What are you all doing! Everyone attack him!’\nWith his lips torn off, his pronunciation was off.\nBut what was more annoying.\n“…”\nDespite his scream, not a single warrior moved.\nThey had just seen a Superior Master get his ass kicked so hard. Who is the idiot that would throw himself at such a monster?\n‘Those bastards!’\nHong Pal-son was getting more and more pissed off.\nHe thought that no matter how strong the enemy was, the juniors would come together and support him, but not a single person stepped forward.\n“I guess not everyone is stupid.”\nChun Yeowun approached him.\nSeeing that, Hong Pal-son’s face turned white.\n‘Is he going to kill me?’\nIt was such a funny situation.\nThe person who was intending to kill was now thinking of his own death.\nTerrified, he tried to move backwards.\n“Hya, wa. I am the bra head of Wuriw. So harw we is to sallenge the austorisy of…”\n“Yah, wait. I am the branch head of the Murim Association of Beijing. To harm me is to challenge the authority of the Murim Association…”\nClash!\nBefore he could even finish speaking, Chun Yeowun waved his hand.\nAnd with a sharp sound, Hong Pal-son’s arm was cut off.\n“Kuaaak! My hand! Hand….”\nChun Yeowun said.\n“What about the Murim Association?”\n‘Y-you… isn’t he afraid of the Murim Association?’\nThe Murim Association was the centre of the Murim world.\nNo warrior would challenge the authority of the Murim Association, which was backed by the State Council.\nBut Chun yeowun didn’t even seem bothered.\nWhen Chun Yeowun tried to raise his hand, Hong Pal-son began to shout.\n“Let me go! Please! I have done wrong!”\n“If you realize, then accept your punishment.”\nWords didn’t seem to work, so Hong Pal-son used his last resort.\n“Please spare my life! I have a young daughter to look after. If I die, she will have no one to look after her.”\nAn emotional appeal.\nChun Yeowun looked at him with a disgusted expression.\n“You are a funny man. What about the people you were about to kill? Don’t they have families too?”\nPointing to the survivors.\n“B… bu…”\nThe survivors were clearly angry at the Murim warriors.\nHe tried to kill them to hide the truth, and now he was dying in a humiliating way right in front of them.\n“Kill him!”\n“He doesn’t deserve to live!”\nSome survivors shouted.\nIf it was a normal day, they would have thought rationally about it, but not today.\nThese people suffered and saw their beloved die at the hands of Ghosts.\n“Die!!”\nEveryone shouted.\n“I see.”\nChun Yeowun smiled and tried to draw his sword.\n“I-I can’t die!”\nPhat!\nThe desire to live was so strong that Hong Pal-son forgot about his injuries and flew towards the Murim warriors.\nThey didn’t help him, so he decided to use them as a shield and escape.\n“Did you think you could run away?”\nChun Yeowun reached out and pulled him back with internal energy.\nStartle!\n‘This?’\nAt that time, a somber energy flowed around, which startled Chun Yeowun.\nIt was completely different from the cold feeling going around.\nThe energy was so strong that Chun Yeowun wasn’t the only one who noticed it.\n“W-wha?”\n“T… this energy?”\nAll the warriors turned their heads around and checked.\nThe direction was at the factory entrance, which was right behind them.\nStill!\nStarting from the entrance, white frost began to fall down on the floor and walls.\nThe walls and floors were all losing their color and turning white as if there was a drop in temperature.\nThe phenomenon was spreading out so fast that no one could even recovered from the shock of seeing it.\nAll of a sudden, the phenomenon which was moving around came for the warriors who were standing still in fear.\n“No…”\nNoticing that, the warriors gulped and looked at the gloomy energy.\nSomething pure white had appeared through the wall.\nShhh!\n‘!!!’\nThe warriors, who looked at it, were shocked.\nIt was a Ghost three times larger than a normal one, which would normally be the size of a human.\nShhhh!\nWith white particles moving behind and around it as if it was waving a dress, the identity was easy to know.\n“Alpha! Alpha!”\nThe warriors who recognized it spoke out loud.\nThis was the key to closing the Gate, which opened right inside the city.\n‘Damn it!’\nHong Pal-son was losing it. An Alpha entity had appeared right where he was and he wasn’t even in the state of dealing with it.\nThis was the worst situation.\nWhen he looked behind, he saw Chun Yeowun looking at the Alpha Ghost.\n‘He is interested in the Alpha too.’\nAny warrior would be interested in an Alpha.\nKilling an S-class Alpha and getting the S-class core was the dream of any warrior.\n‘Ah!’\nIn that brief moment, Hong Pal-son thought of an idea.\nHe thought of it as an opportunity.\nThe Alpha Ghost was an enemy which threatened humanity.\nHe thought that with this, he could convince Chun Yeowun, so he shouted at him.\n“Look. No more fights between us. How about working together and getting rid of this? I will yield the core…”\nIt was then.\n“Eukkk!”\nA warrior shouted in surprise.\n“What happened? Huh?”\nHong Pal-son was shocked and wondered why there was a scream.\nHe saw that the floor was turning white, and the eerie energy kept on moving.\nThe colour of the Murim warrior’s shoes had changed.\nThat was just the beginning.\nShhhh!\n“W-what is this? My, my feet are cold. They aren’t moving! What is this! Kuak!”\nIn an instant, the man’s body turned pale and fell.\nSeeing the frozen body fall, the others shouted.\n“H-he is dead!”\n“Everyone run!”\nFlustered, the warriors retreated away from the white frost.\nEach time the alpha Ghost moved, the range of its control would widen.\nSo they kept on running away.\nShhhh!\n‘What kind of monster…’\nThey all knew that Alphas were different and hard to handle.\nWith ordinary Ghosts, they only had to worry about being touched, but this one was able to use its power on the ground and walls.\n“Uh?”\nAnother unexpected thing happened.\nShhh!\nWhite particles rose from the body of the dead warriors.\nIt was.\n“Ghost!”\n“Ghost came out of the body!”\nAt the birth of a Ghost from the dead body, the warriors went stiff.\nEven though the Ghost had a fuzzy shape, it looked very similar to the dead man.\nIt was as if he had died and turned into a ghost.\nAt that moment, the voice of someone could be heard from the earphones in the helmet.\n-click! This.. is west… team… 1... can… you… listen?\nThe voice belonged to Peng Neung-gyeom, the leader of the west team.\nThe cracking voice continued.\n-Click! Among the Ghosts… the team members who went from the east…. We found similar shaped Ghosts… shhh… we guess… the hazard entities… are from humans… these Ghosts have to be… click.\nWith that, the voice cut off.\nIt sounded like the connection cut off because something wasn’t right, but each warrior could understand what Peng Neung-gyeom was saying.\n“No…”\n“Then the Ghosts we killed so far were people?”\nThe Murim people were shocked.\nThe Ghosts did seem like humans.\nThey were shocked, and the culprit of this situation was the Alpha.\nGhosts came from dead humans.\nShhh!\nMeanwhile, the Ghost that rose from the dead body rushed for them.\nA warrior used sword energy and shouted.\nHe was Ha Hyeon-woo.\nWoong!\n“Does that change anything? In the end, dead people never come back. If that is the case, there is nothing wrong in killing them again! Hm!”\nHa Hyeon-woo used his sword.\nSlash!\nSomething unbelievable happened.\nThe Ghost which came running at him evaded the sword and unleashed a footwork?\n“How?”\nAs if being a Ghost wasn’t enough, it held something like a sword in its hand.\n“Sword?”\nThe Ghost swung it at Ha Hyeon-woo.\nHowever, the sword wasn’t simply moving but was unleashing a sword technique.\nThe sword technique of the dead warrior.\n‘Martial arts?’\nFlustered, Ha Hyeon-woo responded to it.\nHe thought that the Ghost would be vulnerable to heat so he used sword energy as he unleashed techniques.\nClang!\n“No! How is it stopping sword energy?”\nEven sword energy could be stopped.\nHe looked at the Ghost which was moving, and the hand which seemed to be holding something hazy like another sword.\nPuck!\nAt that moment, the Ghost’s hand, which looked like a sword, pierced the chest of Ha Hyeon-woo.\nShocked, he tried to block it with his bare hands.\nShhh!\n“Kuak!”\nThe moment he came in contact with the Ghost, his body turned white and died.\nThud!\n“Hyeon-wooo!!!”\nThe warriors who were close to him shouted.\nBut that was just the beginning. Several Ghosts appeared through the wall behind the Alpha.\n‘!?’\nAnd they were all Murim Ghosts coming from the south.",

      "content": "Chapter 89: Alpha Ghost (2)\n60 or so Ghosts, with hazy weapons in their hands, moved.\nIf each Ghost was able to perform martial arts like they had just witnessed, then everyone in the factory was in a huge crisis.\n‘W-what should we do?’\nThe only advantage they could have was if there was someone stronger than the Ghosts among them. However, the branch president of the Murim Association was now injured.\nShhh!\nThe Alpha Ghost moved, not giving them time to ponder.\nAs it moved, the range of the ice floor widened even more.\nAnd now, it occupied nearly a fifth of the factory.\n“W-we have to run away!”\n“We can’t go against all of them!”\nTerrified, the warriors began to run.\nThey turned and ran to where the survivors were.\nShhh! Shhh!\nFrom the side of the factory, regular Ghosts arrived.\nIn huge numbers.\nAt first glance, it seemed like all the Ghosts in the vicinity flocked to this place.\n“Damn it!”\nAll the exits were blocked.\nFlustered and bewildered, the warriors heard something similar to a burst of eerie laughter from the Alpha Ghost.\nHuhuhuhuhu!\nA hazy ghostly laugh. The sight and sound were both creepy.\n“Is it summoning Ghosts around here?”\nIt was a known fact that the Alpha was the leader of the group.\nBut this was the first time they were seeing such a level of intelligence.\nThis Alpha knew how to control its kind.\n“Kyaaaak!”\n“This is it. We are all going to die.”\nThe survivors were all scared, looking at the huge number of Ghosts.\nThere was no way that anyone would be calm in such a situation.\nEven the warriors were the same.\n‘This is it. There is only one way to go out.’\n‘It is unreasonable to face the Alpha and the warrior Ghosts at the same time.’\nTheir eyes naturally turned to the survivors.\nThe Ghosts were coming in huge numbers, but at least sword energy works on them.\nIf their objective wasn’t to subdue the enemy but to break past them, then there was only one chance.\nShhhh!\nThe range of the ice moved further as the Alpha moved a little.\nThe Ghosts went closer to the people, enjoying the fear in their eyes.\nHuhuhuhuhu!\nThe creepy laughter from the Alpha was heard again.\nThe warriors, who looked at each other, nodded.\nAnd the moment they decided to move.\nShh!\nChun Yeowun opened his mouth.\n“Hu Bong.”\n“Yes, Lord!”\n“Change of plans. Take refuge with your wife and those people. I will clean this place.”\n“Yes!”\nHu Bong was disappointed, but he still answered.\nHe wanted to fight with Chun Yeowun too, but he couldn’t leave his wife or the other people alone.\n‘For the sake of my wife.’\nHe didn’t care too much about the survivors who didn’t belong to their Cult, but he couldn’t ignore his wife.\nHu Bong raised his arms, and at that moment.\nWheik!\nDozens of flame spheres appeared in the air.\nThe Ghosts, who were slowly narrowing the distance, didn’t come any closer because of the heat.\n‘W-what? Is that guy a monster too?’\nHong Pal-son was shocked.\nHe didn’t expect Hu Bong to be this strong.\nIt was hard to believe that Hu Bong was a martial artist in the first place. This just made him go silent.\n‘He fully embodied the Flame qi.’\nChun Yeowun was satisfied with Hu Bong’s development.\nHe did see Hu Bong fight in the cave. It felt like he had fully taken in the qi.\nIt was beyond metamorphosis.\nAt that, Hu Bong smiled and said.\n“I might not be able to handle it as precisely as my Lord, but this much is good.”\nHu Bong reached out towards the Ghosts.\nThe flame spheres rushed at them at once.\nWheik! Shhh!\nThe Ghosts tried to avoid being hit by the flame spheres, but there were too many of them, and they got hit.\nPapapak!\nThe targeted Ghosts were torn apart.\nHu Bong didn’t stop with that. He concentrated on hitting the walls with flame.\nSwoosh!\nKwang! Kwakwakwang!\nAs a result, the northern entrance which was filled with Ghosts was opened.\nNot missing the chance, Mun Ran-yeong yelled.\n“I will take the lead, everyone, follow me!”\nPhat!\nShe stepped forward with a flame sphere in her hand and used it whenever a Ghost got close.\nShe had exhausted her energy, so now she was using a small amount of energy to deal with normal Ghosts.\n“H-Hurry up!”\n“We will live!”\n“Woahh!”\nThe survivors, who were scared of dying, shouted as they followed her.\nHu Bong followed behind them and eliminated the Ghosts that were following.\n“Done! Open the way!”\n“We should follow them too!”\nThe scared warriors flew in the other direction.\nIn order to not miss the chance, Hong Pal-son also tried to escape from there.\nPang!\n“Huh!”\nThe Murim warriors, who were running at their best, were blocked by something and bounced back.\nThey tried to move again, but something like a strong wall was blocking them.\n“What is this?”\n“I can’t get past this!”\nHong Pal-son, who knew what it was, mumbled in shock.\n“T-this… internal energy?”\nAlthough he was injured, he could feel the energy. And what stood in their way was energy itself.\n“This is internal energy?”\nThe eyes of the Murim people turned towards Chun Yeowun, who had his hand outstretched.\nIt was absurd that this man was trying to prevent them from leaving the place.\n“What the hell is this!”\n“Aren't you going to pull back the energy?”\nShhh!\nGradually, white color spread on the floor to where they were standing.\nChun Yeowun spoke calmly.\n“Since when did you think that we were on the same side?”\n“W-what?”\nAt those words, the murim people couldn’t hide their shock.\nWho would have thought that Chun Yeowun would still consider them as enemies despite a greater enemy standing right in front of them?\n“Please don’t do this!”\n“I beg of you. We are all Murim warriors here. Please open the way.”\n“This isn’t the right way!”\nThe Murims were begging.\nBut Chun Yeowun didn’t even blink his eyes and said.\n“Have a good battle.”\nAnd he smiled.\n“Damn it!”\n“I am going to break this.”\nIn the end, the Murim people tried to break down the wall of energy using their swordsmanship.\nBut that was an impossible thing.\nShhh!\nBecause the Ghosts which went back flew towards them.\n“Huk!”\n“S-stop!”\nThe warriors hastily confronted them.\nAs seen before, warrior Ghosts could use their swordsmanships.\nPapak!\nIt was as if two warriors were fighting.\nHowever, since Ghosts were extremely dangerous at a close distance, the Murim warriors had to fight them from afar.\n“Kuk!”\nHong Pal-son was the only one who couldn’t fight because of the injury and remained in front of the invisible wall, staring at Chun Yeowun with hateful eyes.\n[You are not human. If you really want to get rid of the resentment, you should deal with those entities which are the enemies of mankind first.]\nHis lips were ripped off, so his speech was slurred.\nThat's why he sent a telepathic message.\n“Enemies…”\n[Aren't you trying to use me and the other warriors here to fight the Ghosts? Since no matter how strong you are, you are alon….]\nGrab!\n“Kuak!”\nChun Yeowun extended his arm and acted like he grabbed the neck of Hong Pal-son.\nWho now seemed to be in pain.\n“You are misunderstanding something.”\n“Cough… what?”\n“Do you think I didn’t let you people go out because I am using you?”\nAt those words, Chun Yeowun stretched out his other hand to the sky.\nWheik!\nAn uncountable number of Flame swords was generated inside the factory.\nThe factory turned hot all of a sudden.\n“W-what is this?”\n“Flame swords?”\nThe warriors who were fighting Ghosts couldn’t help but be shocked.\nThis flame was different from the flame sphere that Hu Bong used.\nHong Pal-son, who looked at that, forgot his pain and stared at Chun Yeowun.\n‘W-who the hell is he?’\nFive Great Warriors of the current Murim.\nNo, even the president of the Murim Association, who is known to be the strongest, could he do this?\nChun Yeowun said.\n“Why do you think I did this? It was to get rid of all of you here at once.”\n‘!?’\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, Hong Pal-son’s face turned pale.\nThe man’s intention was to kill everyone within the factory.\nAnd that was the reason why he sent the survivors, Hu Bong and Mun ran-yeong outside.\nHuhuhuhuhu!\nThe Alpha Ghost made a strange sound.\nAnd all the Ghosts which were fighting with the warriors rushed at Chun Yeowun at once.\n“Even the monster has a smart brain.”\nAlpha Ghost knew that Chun Yeowun had to be stopped.\nChun Yeowun looked up at him and smiled.\n“Late.”\nAnd then, he lifted his arm which was holding Hong Pal-son’s neck.\n“Uh-huh?”\n‘Uhhh? What are you trying to do?’\nHong Pal-son’s eyes trembled and moved his body.\nBut nothing worked.\nChun Yeowun immediately threw Hong Pal-son at the Ghosts which were rushing in.\n“N... Nooooo!”\nHe screamed as much as he could.\nPak!\n“Kuak!”\nBut he collided with the Ghost head-on and lost his life right away as his body fell to the ground.\n“President!!!”\nThe warriors were shocked at the outrageous death of their head and glared at Chun Yeowun.\nWho could have thought that the man would be thrown at the Ghosts?\n“You ruthless man!”\n“How could you do that!”\nChun Yeowun extended his hand, not bothering with them.\n“You all should worry about your own lives.”\n“What?”\nWhoo!\nAt that moment, all the flame swords came down at once.\nChachachak!\n“C-crazy bastard!”\n“Avoid it!”\nTerrified, the warriors tried to avoid it, but the flame swords were faster.\nKwakwakwang!\nSky Flash of Flame Swords.\nThis was much stronger than the normal Sky Flash.\nThe flames indiscriminately destroyed not just the Ghosts but even the warriors and the factory.\n400 meters away from the factory site.\nBang! Bang! Bang!\nExplosions erupted everywhere.\n“Wh-what is that?”\n“Look over there!”\nSwoosh!\nRays of flames were seen across the sky in the distance.\nThe survivors who were fleeing were stunned.\nBecause the explosions were coming from the factory they were in.\nOnly Hu Bong was smiling.\n“Hehe. Indeed my Lord is the best!”",

      "content": "Chapter 90: Alpha Ghost (3)\nIn the heart of Datong city.\nThe eyes of the Murim people inside the moving military truck were directed somewhere.\nIt was where the red beams and explosions appeared from a distance.\n“Look over there!”\n“What is that?”\nIt was far, so they couldn’t make out what was actually happening.\nBut they knew for sure that something crazy had occurred.\n“Might be the Alpha.”\n“What do we do, leader?”\nThe Murims asked someone for his opinion.\nIt was the leader of this group, Bu Do-kyun, the president of Six Life Insurance.\nHe was leaning against the driver seat when he knocked on the window and said to the driver.\nKnock!\n“Change the direction.”\n“Yes!”\nThe military truck veered towards the red beam.\nA factory swept away by flames.\nNot only the inside, but even the entire building had collapsed.\nIt was now only filled with traces of destruction.\nEven the surrounding factories had collapsed, making the entire area look like a bombing scene.\n“Did I overdid it?”\nIn the middle of the factory, Chun Yeowun was standing.\nHe glanced around and mumbled.\nIt definitely seemed like he overdid it.\nHowever, there was nothing like Sky Flash when it came to removing multiple enemies at once.\nForget about the Ghosts, finding the bodies of the Murim warriors now seemed impossible.\n“Hmm.”\nChun Yeowun looked at the sky in the southwest direction.\nThere was energy coming in from the Gate, which meant that the Alpha wasn’t dead.\n“Where are you? You…”\nHaving Broadened his senses, Chun Yeown’s gaze turned from the sky to his feet.\nIt was then.\nShhhh!\nWhere Chun Yeowun was standing, the ground lost its life and turned white.\nPhut!\nChun Yeowun jumped into the air.\nIn that brief moment, something jumped out at high speed.\nThat blurry thing was the Alpha Ghost.\n“You were hiding there?”\n[Huu… hu… uhhhhhh!]\nAll parts of the Alpha Ghost’s body were hurt with the flame, and because of that, it seemed angry.\nThe Alpha Ghost emitted waves of white particles which floated in all directions and then came for Chun Yeowun.\nShhhh!\nThe white particles moved very quickly. In an instant, they reached Chun Yeowun.\n[Uhh?]\nThe Alpha titled its head.\nShockingly, nothing occurred to Chun Yeowun even though the white stuff touched him.\n“Did you think you could steal my soul?”\nBlack energy rose from Chun Yeowun’s body.\nThe Sky Demon energy protected him.\n“It seems like I'm closer to darkness than you are.”\nChun Yeowun smiled.\nPure darkness, the energy that was filled with resentment, hatred and murderous intent, could never succumb.\n“Now it is my turn.”\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun raised his hand.\nFive invisible swords suddenly appeared around him. Sky Demon energy and Flame qi were both engulfing them.\nWhiek!\nThe black flame gave an uncontrollable power that was so different from a regular Flame qi sword.\nBrrr!\n[Huu… huuu… huuuu!]\nDid it sense the pure darkness and the bursting heat on the swords?\nThe Alpha Ghost stopped aiming for Chun Yeowun and tried to run away.\n“Useless.”\nChun Yeowun stretched out his hand towards it.\nAs if waiting, the five swords rushed and pierced the Alpha Ghost.\nAs it was an Alpha, it was more heat resistant than normal Ghosts.\nHowever, nothing could stand against the almighty black flame.\n[Uhhhhhhh!]\nAn uncanny scream of unbearable pain.\nNot wanting to die, the Alpha Ghost tried to seep its body into the floor.\n“That will be your grave.”\nSwish!\nAs Chun Yeowun’s waved his hand, the black flame swords changed their trajectory and aimed for the other parts of the Alpha’s body.\nShhh! Puck!\n[Uhhhhh!]\nThe white particles turned black as they scattered everywhere.\nWhen it repeated over three times, the Alpha Ghost’s original form was destroyed.\nThud!\nThe Gate core, in the form of a black sphere, fell to the floor.\nThe core was the size of a human head.\n“Sweet!”\nThis would have been an absurd sight.\nHow many people could make an S-class Alpha entity run away?\nChun Yeowun grabbed the core and used his internal energy.\n‘Strong.’\nThe A-class core had cracked when he used this level of internal energy.\nBut this core was holding its ground.\nIndeed. How expected from an S-class core!\n‘Then.’\nHe would have to put more effort.\nWhen Chun Yeowun applied double the energy, it began to crack.\nEventually, the outer shell of the core was completely cracked, and a gap opened.\nJjkkk!\nPang!\nA strong wave of energy erupted from inside the cracked shell.\nShhh!\nThe waves spread in all directions.\nIt was as if it moved at the speed of light.\nThe entire city of Datong was covered.\nBefore long, the Gate to the southwest began to close.\nBang! Bang!\nAt the wall around the Datong city, the Defense forces, who were desperately trying to stop the Ghosts from coming out, shouted in shock!\n“Uh! Th-there!”\n“The Ghosts have disappeared!”\nShhhh!\nThe Ghosts left like ghosts.\nTheir forms shattered and disappeared in white.\n“Wahhh!!!”\nThe soldiers who were watching this cheered at once.\nThe people in the aircraft tanks and those on the wall were all excited.\nThe garrison was in an uproar too.\n“Commander! The Gate is closing!”\n“Woaooo!”\nAll the officers in the barracks screamed and cheered at the lieutenant’s report.\nIt was a miracle that an S-class hazard Gate was closed within 2 days.\nCho Hyung-mu, who was next to the commander, patted him on the back.\n“Look there. What you said couldn’t happen happened!”\nAt the man’s political way of talking, the commander’s face frowned.\nIt was obvious just how much this man was going to use the Gate to his advantage.\nAnd then, Cho Hyung-mu said.\n“Commander! What are you doing? Now, if there are no Ghosts, conduct a large-scale search quickly.”\n‘Ah…’\nHe did not forget to look for his kids.\nAt that moment, the expression of the commander darkened.\nNone of the warriors he deployed had reported anything back.\nMeanwhile, Chun Yeowun was looking at the shell.\nThere was still a piece of shell attached to the core, but the energy reaching out was strong.\nPhhhh!\nWhen Chun Yeowun induced more energy, the cracked shell pieces fell apart.\nSwoosh!\nA pure core emitting light was revealed.\n“Oh.”\nAn exclamation flowed out of Chun Yeowun’s mouth.\nWhen he examined the A-class core, the amount of energy was comparable to that of a spirit beast core.\nHowever, the power inside this S-class core was much stronger than that.\nTwice the energy of an A-class.\n‘Everyone wants it.’\nIf someone would take this energy, then not just something on the level of Divine Master, but it could be a whole different level of growth.\nHowever, the energy emitted in this core was so great that it seemed unreasonable for normal warriors to consume it without refining it.\n‘The body won’t stand it.’\nOnly by reaching enlightenment would one's body accept such a form of energy.\nRecklessly accepting any source of energy might make it turn into a poison.\nTak!\nChun Yeowun grabbed the S-class core and then kept playing catch with it.\n‘Well, this is of no use to me.’\nFor Chun Yeowun, this pure form of energy was meaningless.\nBy absorbing the cores of 5 spirit beasts, he gained absolute strength and surpassed the limits of a normal human body.\nHe was able to freely use the energy in nature after reaching the Heavenly Master level.\n‘I don’t need it.’\nIf it could have a use, then maybe to train others.\nThe Sky Demon Order surely lacked skill in this era.\nAnd in this time, since the energy in nature was lacking, such a core was a treasure to have.\n‘Then, let’s go to Hu Bong… hm?’\nAt that time, Chun Yeowun narrowed his eyes and looked at the core.\nHe didn't realise it because of the light, but he saw something hazy inside the core.\n‘What?’\nIt was hard to see.\n‘Nano, control the light which enters my eyes.’\n[Adjusting the light in wide mode.]\nWong!\nChun Yeowun’s pupils shook and contracted.\nThe light then faded away.\nThe phenomenon where the light entering his eyes was controlled.\nIn doing so, he examined the core.\n‘Huh?’\nSomething was inside the core.\nSomething uniquely shaped.\nChun Yeowun asked.\n‘Nano what is this?’\n[Unknown. It is wrapped in pure core energy that cannot be checked.]\n‘If I break it, will it come out?’\n[That will result in a significant loss of energy.]\n‘Can you temporarily absorb the energy of the core?’\n[Possible.]\nIn the past, Nano managed to absorb the core of the White Tiger and then passed it to Chun Yeowun.\nIt took that energy as a recharge.\nThe gatelinium metal in Nano made it possible. And this metal was something beyond the Gate which didn’t exist on earth.\n‘Then, do it.’\n[Understood.]\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun’s hands, which were holding the core, soon had gloves equipped on them.\nWires protruded and wrapped around the core.\n[Absorbing the energy of the core. 5%.]\nThe light was being sucked in.\nNano, who had absorbed the energy from the White Tiger core in the past, did this with ease.\n[20%]\nHowever, it was happening faster than expected. Since the energy was pure, it seemed like the process of absorbing it happened quickly.\n[90%]\nThe energy was absorbed in 5 minutes.\nThe dazzling light on the core was sucked away, and now it looked weak.\n“This should be enough.”\nChun Yeowun used strength onto the weakened core.\nThen the core cracked like the outer shell.\nPhhh!\nWhen he applied more force, it cracked more.\nAnd then the unique shaped thing hidden inside came into view.\n‘What is this?’\nThere was something the size of a palm, and it gave off a dazzling light.\n‘As expected.’\nIt contained a lot of energy too. However, this weird star-shaped core had a unique aura.\nIt resembled the gloomy Alpha Ghost energy.\nChun Yeowun was watching it carefully when an unexpected phenomenon unfolded.\nDrrr!\n“Huh?”\nChun Yeowun brought out the wrist guard on his right hand, which was trembling.\nIt was as if it was resonating with the new star shaped core.\n‘What? Why is the Sky demon sword?’\nChun Yeowun couldn’t figure it out.\nThe Sky Demon Sword was a sword made from a meteorite that fell on the earth during the time of Chun Ma.\nIt had the energy of the fallen dragon, but this was the first time that this sword had resonated like this except when it was first acquired.\n‘What is it trying to say? Sky Demon Sword.’\nPrrr!\n“Uh?”\nThe star shaped core trembled.\nThey were trying to get closer along with the resonation.\nIt was then.\nChachachacha!\nChun Yeowun didn’t call for it, yet the sword came out on its own.\nPak!\nAt that time, the star-shaped core in Chun Yeowun’s hand got attached to the sword.\nAt the unknown phenomenon, Chun Yeowun tried to hurriedly grab it away from the stone.\nBut something amazing happened.\nShhhh!\nFrom the star shaped core, a bright blue light entered into the sword.\nAnd the sword, too, began to be entirely engulfed in the brilliant blue light.\nThe light soon spread to Chun Yeowun’s hand.\nFlash!\n“Uhk!”\nThe blue light permeated Chun Yeowun’s hand.\nChun Yeowun, who felt an intense ting like a lightning strike, let go of the sword, but illusions appeared in his mind.\n‘This… this is…’\nShhh!\nIt was like when Nano sent him information. However, this wasn’t that simple.\n“Ugh!”\nAs if it was being engraved into his mind, the illusion was showing him something.\nAnd suddenly, blue light flashed from Chun yeowun’s eyes.\nTuk!\nWhen he was immersed into this, the bright blue light disappeared from the star shaped core as it fell to the ground.\nIt was now emitting an ordinary light like a pure core.\nBrrr!\nChun yeowun, unaware of that, continued to be captivated by the blue illusion and didn’t move.\nTen minutes passed.\nRumble!\n30 men in protective suits ran towards the factory ruins.\nThey were all warriors who came in haste.\nThey were looking for something in the ruins.\n“This is…”\nA vast energy around the place stimulated their senses.\nIt was the energy of the S-class core.\nThe Murim people who had a good sense went closer.\n“Ah! Leader! There!”\nA warrior pointed to the centre, where only rubble remained.\nSomeone was standing there with a sword.\nChun Yeowun.\n“Oh my!”\nThe eyes of all the warriors turned in a certain direction.\nGoo!\nOne meter in front of Chun Yeowun, a star shaped core was emitting a dazzling light.\n“Core!”\nThe faces of warriors who discovered the core turned greedy.\nIt wasn’t a normal core.\nIt was an S-class.\nIt was the greatest treasure for all the people.\nOf course, not everyone looked at the core.\nBu Do-kyun, the president of Six Life Insurance, was puzzled.\n‘… why is he being like that in front of the core?’\nChun Yeowun was watching from a distance as if he had lost his mind.\nHe couldn’t see if the man was dazed or just lost consciousness, but his eyes were open.\nIt was strange for someone to act like that in front of a core.\nPhat!\nA warrior, who couldn’t hold back the greed, flew there.\n“What are you doing?”\n“Whoever gets it first is its owner!”\n“Come on, wait up! We don’t know anything yet!”\n“That man has lost his mind, so the owner of the core hasn’t been decided yet!”\n“Shit! That one!”\nPhat!\nIn order to not lose the core, the other warriors too went there too.\nThey no longer saw their leader as a leader.\nThey were all wanting to get their hands on the S-class core.\n‘Mine!’\n‘I need to get the S-class core!’\nThe time when everyone raced there with hopes.\nShhh\n!\nChun Yeowun’s eyes, which had lost focus, were back to normal.\nThe warriors who didn’t see that, were only focusing on the core.\n‘Rats have flocked over here.’\nSeventeen were running towards the core.\nTrying to be faster than the others to catch it.\n‘This is good.’\nChun Yeowun smiled as he looked at them.\nThere was something that he wanted to check out.\nChun Yeowun put the Sky Demon Sword to the ground and touched it.\nPak!\nThat moment.\nBlue light flashed from the Sky Demon Sword, and its colour began to change like frost.\nThe ground where the sword touched turned all white.\n“Wait! Stop everyone!”\nBo Go-kyun, who was watching it from afar, shouted at them.\nHowever, since they were too greedy, they didn’t care and kept going for the core.\nIt was then.\n“Kuak!”\nFive warriors, who were running ahead, stopped, and their bodies trembled.\n“What?”\n“Why did they stop?”\nThe warriors who were behind them were puzzled.\nAll five of them turned white.\nAnd went stiff.\n“T-this?”\nThis was something they had seen.\nA phenomenon that happened when one died in the hands of a Ghost.\nAt that moment, the voice of Bu Do-kyun entered the other warriors’ ears.\n“Get away now! Don’t touch the ground!”\nShhh! Shh!\n“Huh?”\nSuddenly, the floor ahead was losing life in it.\nFlustered, the warriors backed away.\n“What is this? Why is the ground…”\nBut their shock didn’t end there.\nShhh!\nFrom the five bodies which lost life, a hazy thing emerged.\nIt left ghost traces and white particles as it moved up.\n“G-Ghost!!!”\nIt was the hazard entity Ghost.\nFrom the eyes of the blurred Ghosts, blue light was radiating.\nLike the one coming from the Sky Demon Sword.",

      "content": "Chapter 91: Ghost Qi (1)\n“How could a Ghost suddenly appear?”\n“It came out from the body…”\nAll the Murim warriors couldn’t hide their shock. What surprised them even more was that the faint Ghosts resembled the dead warriors.\n“Chung-jae?”\n“Ah-hyun?”\nThey had already heard Paeng Neung-gyeom’s report a couple of moments ago.\nHowever, since they hadn’t seen it in person till now, their shock was too extreme.\n“No way…”\n“Then the Ghosts were coming from the dead?”\nThey were now sure of it after looking at the Ghosts’ faces.\nBut what was more incomprehensible was that this was happening after the Gate had closed.\nIndeed. The Gate has closed.\nSo.\nWhy was a Ghost coming up now?\n“Look, the floor!”\n“Uh?”\nAt the cry of one warrior, the others looked at the ground.\nThe range of the lifeless floor continued to expand.\nIt was over 50 meters now.\nTak!\nThe warriors spread their footwork and moved backwards.\nThe Ghosts of the dead warriors rushed towards the people with flashing blue eyes.\nShhh!\n“Damn it!”\nWoong!\nAll the warriors got their sword energy ready.\nAnd then they tried to hit the Ghost.\nChachacha!\nThe Ghost's weakness was the heat.\nAnd if they were to use it while maintaining a good distance, there is nothing they couldn’t handle.\nHowever.\nThere was one thing they weren’t aware of.\n“W-What?”\n“It blocked the sword energy!”\nThe Ghosts were able to use martial arts they had learned when they were alive, so they became stronger after turning into Ghosts.\n“Is that sword energy?”\n“Ah! It uses footwork too!”\nThey grew more confused when they saw Ghosts unfold martial arts.\nNormally, people would tend to jump around when unexpected things happen.\nHowever, the warriors responded by creating a distance between them and the Ghosts, which were coming for them.\nChang!\n“How in hell are they unfolding the swordsmanship?”\nThe Ghost warriors were crazy scary beings.\nBy condensing the hazy white particles, they were even able to block the sword energy.\nShhh!\nIn addition, since their bodies were all Ghost-like and couldn’t be touched, the warriors had no other choice but to perform their footwork.\nPak!\n“Kuak!”\nThe first victim for the Ghost warrior fell.\nWhile competing with the Ghost, the warrior’s hand touched it, and he died.\n“Be careful not to touch it!”\n“Damn it! Don’t go in alone. Let’s work together!”\n“I will block the front, so aim at them from behind!”\n“Alright!”\nHowever, when it came to numbers, the warriors were at an advantage.\nThere were only 5 Ghosts, when the Murim people were about 24, excluding their leader, who was far away from the factory.\nThe Murim people, who were confused, slowly calmed down and found a solution.\n“Hmph!”\nChak!\nTwo Ghosts died.\nExcited, the warriors shouted.\n“There is nothing I can’t deal with if I pay attention to not being touched.”\n“I am glad that Ah-hyun's skills are lower than mine.”\nThe warriors learned one thing about the Ghosts they were dealing with.\nGhosts could perform martial arts that they learned when they were alive, but their ability to use them was relatively low.\nAnd when numerically expressed, the power was decreased to about 50 or 60 percent.\nThat was partially balanced, thanks to the touch-death skills. However, when going against a huge group of people, the Ghosts didn’t have an advantage.\n“Get rid of the rest of them quickly…”\nWhup!\n“Kuak!”\nSomeone put a sword into the chest of the warrior.\nHe looked to see Chun Yeowun.\n“Yo-you!”\n“There was one thing I wanted to check.”\n“What… what are you say….”\nBefore he could even finish his words, a gloomy blue light shone from the Sky Demon Sword in Chun Yeowun’s hands.\nWoong!\n“Kuak!”\nAt that moment, the body of the warrior turned pale and lifeless.\nShh!\nAs he drew back the sword, the warrior fell to the floor.\nThe other people couldn’t hide their shock at the sudden attack.\n“What is he doing… uh?”\nShhh!\nAn amazing thing happened.\nFrom the dead Murim’s body, something hazy came out.\nA Ghost.\nThe Ghost with bright blue eyes looked at Chun Yeowun and bowed, as if it considered him his master.\n“I see this is how it is.”\nChun Yeowun nodded his head.\nOn the other hand, the warriors, who saw it, realized one thing.\n“H-he! He is the one making Ghosts!”\n“How is he doing this?”\nThe Ghost was an entity that came from the Gate. But they hadn’t heard anything about a human controlling it.\n‘Making a Ghost?’\nBu Do-kyun, who was on the other side of the factory, was shocked.\nHe was observing the situation from afar and was convinced that Chun Yeowun’s sword was the one that had done this.\nHowever, in the beginning, he thought that it was a coincidence when the warriors turned into Ghosts.\nNow, he was sure.\n‘Who the hell is he?’\nBu Do-kyun was curious.\nHe was hesitant to step in and help them.\nIf the man had the ability to create Ghosts, then it was a matter of killing him, but something felt weird.\n‘But the way he just moved.’\nIt was so fast that he didn’t see Chun Yeowun move.\nBu Do-kyun was a Superior Master, and he couldn’t see the movement.\nThat meant that the opponent was someone who was on a higher level than him.\n‘Haa…’\nBu Do-kyun looked at the S-class core, which was still on the floor.\nThe opportunity to have it was rare.\n‘Should I just grab it and run away?’\nThe opponent was busy with the warriors. This could be his chance.\n‘No. what do I do if he gives up the fight with them and pursues me?’\nBu Do-kyun was a man of rational judgement. Never do something unless he had a certain chance of winning.\nBu Do-kyun put his hand in a bag at his waist and fiddled inside.\nIt was a small stick about the size of a pen.\n‘Derpencil.’\nThis specially crafted object was a modern item.\nAnd if the button was pushed, the ammunition inside would detonate, and hundreds of needles would fire at an incredible speed at enemies within 5 steps.\nWhat was more amazing was that each needle was a bomb.\n‘A descendant of the DANG company of the Tang clan had made this self-defense weapon!’\nThe maximum effective distance was within 10 meters, but in 5 steps it was a 100% chance to kill.\n‘I need to get close enough. Close….’\nBu Do-kyun, who fiddled with it, stood up.\nIt was the only way to distract Chun Yeowun.\nShhh!\nBu Do-kyun pulled out his long sword and moved to the place where Chun Yeowun was.\nAt the appearance of a powerful ally, the warriors shouted.\n“Leader! This man is creating a Ghost. If we don’t kill him…”\nSlash!\n“Huh?”\nBu Do-kyun cut off the warrior’s head with a long sword.\nThat sudden action made them all go bewildered.\n“L-leader! What are you doing?”\n“Have you gone crazy!”\nKeeping a straight face, Bu Do-kyun spoke.\n“There is a thing called law in Murim! How can you all act greedy and try to covet something which belongs to another warrior? How unforgivable!”\nPhat!\nWith that, he attacked the others.\n“Ah no!”\nThe warriors were all baffled.\nChachang!\n“Kuak!”\nBu Do-kyun once again took down another man.\n“Damn it!”\nIn the end, they all had to fight to survive.\nHowever, since Bu Do-kyun was a Superior Master, the others couldn’t stand much. And their leader was already fixed on killing them.\n“Kuak… yo. You traitor.”\n“Is it beneficial to attack the members of the same association??…”\nAs they were dying, they all cursed.\nAnd while listening to their curses, Bu Do-kyun didn’t stop and kept going on killing his own people.\nHe even killed those who wanted to escape.\nSh!\nChun Yeowun watched the entire show with his arms crossed.\nBu Do-kyun, who killed the last warrior, sheathed his sword.\nChun Yeowun asked.\n“Weren’t you on the same side?”\n“Yes.”\nHe answered without lying.\nChun Yeowun asked, looking at the man.\n“Yet you killed them?”\nThud!\nBu Do-kyun knelt on the floor, and bowed low enough for his head to touch the floor.\n“I made sure they paid the price for attacking and falling into their greed.”\n“And you want to live in return for that?”\n“You are strong enough to kill everyone, including me. As a rational warrior, I want to serve you, who is strong.”\nBu Do-kyun lowered and expressed his intentions of becoming Chun Yeowun’s subordinate.\nOf course, that wasn’t his real intention.\nThe goal was to make sure Chun Yeowun trusted him, and then come closer, closer than 10 steps to use that pen.\n‘Come closer. Closer.’\nFive more steps, and he could use the Derpencil.\nAs he waited with tensed eyes, Chun Yeowun opened his mouth.\n“Fine. I needed someone like you. Raise your head.”\n‘Yes!’\nBu Do-kyun was happy.\nNow all he had to do was make Chun Yeowun get closer to him.\nFor the first time, he calmed his face and raised his head without showing any expression.\nIt was then.\nPuck!\n“Kuak!”\nSomething pierced his chest.\nIt was the Sky Demon Sword.\n“Uh… why… you… you accepted… me…”\nBu Do-kyun looked at Chun Yeowun as if this was unfair.\nTo that, the answer was.\n“I accept you... as a Ghost.”\n“Wh-what?”\nBu Do-kyun’s eyes widened.\nHe hadn’t expected such a turn in the situation.\nThe gloomy light on the sword passed through his chest.\nBrrr!\n“Euk! Kuuk!”\nConvulsions spread all over the body, and his body began to turn weak and pale.\nThe dead man bowed his limp body.\nRoll.\nThe pencil he was holding fell from his hands without being used.\nShhh!\nAnd a Ghost appeared from the body.\n“The distance was long.”\nChun Yeowun checked to see if he could freely use the powers in the sword.\nThe experiment was successful.\nBecause of the Sword Heart, which was like a connection between him and the sword, he was able to use the skills of the sword without touching it.\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun reached out, and the Sky Demon energy in the body of Bu Do-kyun came back.\nAnd as he grabbed onto it, the eyes of Chun Yeowun shone blue.\nGoo!\nWhen he looked at the Ghost, which came from the body, he could see the blue light turn stronger.\nThis Ghost was brighter than the other ones.\n‘The stronger the Ghost, the brighter and darker the light.’\nThis was something only Chun Yeowun could see.\nThis Ghost of Bu Do-kyun was much stronger than the others.\nEven if the Ghost was weaker in strength, the brightness it had seemed like he was at the beginning of Superior Level Master.\nTak!\nChun Yeowun put his sword on the floor and gave an order.\n“Come in.”\nAs soon as the order fell, the Ghosts approached them and then went into the Sky Demon Sword.\nThis time, Chun Yeowun held the sword in the opposite direction.\nAnd the four Ghosts came closer to it with an eerie energy and went inside.\nBut Chun Yeowun didn’t seem shocked.\n“Done.”\nThe Ghosts could be put inside the sword and then summoned out, unless it was destroyed.\nWhat was strange was the illusions that he had seen.\nAnother ability.\n“Come out.”\nShh\n!\nThe Ghost of Bu Do-kyun came out.\nChun Yeowun put his hand on the head of the Ghost.\nNormally, when a living person would come into contact with the Ghost, the body would turn pale and lifeless, but in this case, Chun Yeowun’s hand turned blue.\nWoong!\nAnd then a blue light penetrated him.\nAs the light completely entered, thoughts entered Chun Yeowun’s head.\nThe illusion looked like a film being played through someone else’s view.\n[Haa…]\n[Should I take it and run away?]\n[No. What if he gives up fighting with them and pursues me.]\n[The descendant of DANG of the Tang clan made…]\n[Closer, come closer]\nThe voice of Bu Do-kyun.\nShockingly, they were the last line of thoughts he had.\nIt wasn’t long, but everything he was thinking after Chun Yeowun appeared was there.\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun reached out somewhere, and the small pencil which had fallen to the floor got pulled in his hand.\nIt was because he heard the thoughts.\n“Reading the memories before death… How useful.”\nChun Yeowun smiled.\nThis was an unexpectedly satisfying ability.\n‘No need to waste time on torture.’",

      "content": "Chapter 92: Ghost Qi (2)\nA gloomy blue light with the ability to rob the vitality of a being.\nChun Yeowun called it Ghost qi.\nAs a result of experimenting with various things he learned from the illusion, he learnt most things he could do with this qi.\nFirst.\n‘Robs lives.’\nIf an opponent was stabbed with the sword, his life could be taken away.\nSecond.\n‘Those without vitality are turned to Ghosts.’\nAnd those Ghosts could exert around 60 to 70% of their abilities.\nNormal Ghosts were vulnerable to heat, but Murim class ones could resist that to some extent.\nThey could even block the attacks if the Ghost was a Super Master.\nThird.\n‘A Ghost can be placed inside the Sky Demon Sword.’\nThe created Ghosts could be stored in the sword.\nIt meant that it could be stored semi-permanent.\nIn a way, the more the Ghosts, the more troops he had.\nThe only downside was, once it vanishes, it is gone.\nIt was still not known how many Ghosts could be put inside his sword.\nFourth.\n‘Reading the memories of the Ghosts.’\nReading the thoughts of the Ghost before death. The sights it’d seen and the situations it’d been through.\nNot all the memories though.\nHe could see about 10 to 15 mins before death.\nIt was a bit unfortunate, but good enough for Chun Yeowun.\n‘That is all I could know for now. However, seeing that it was able to create the Ghost without touching the sword, there could be other abilities too.’\nAnd he would gradually figure it out.\nChun Yeowun carried the special Derpencil and the S-class core in his waist bag.\nHe then asked.\n‘Nano. Have you finished analyzing the smartphone?’\n[As a result of analysis, there is no data related to the headquarters of Blade Six.]\nChun Yeowun read the memories of the Ghost.\nAnd he found out that Bu Do-kyun is the president of an affiliate of Blade Six.\n‘And seeing how he wasn’t using that technique, he couldn’t have been an executive at the headquarters.’\nThe man didn’t seem to be aware of Blade Six techniques.\nIf he did, then Chun Yeowun would have recognized him right away.\nThere was nothing about Blade Six in the phone since this man wasn’t related to the executives.\n‘Well, it doesn’t matter.’\nAnyway, Blade Six’s headquarters was open to the public.\nUnlike the past where Chun Yeowun had to go through a lot of trouble to know where their clan base was, in the current era, they were visible to everyone.\nAnd the same was the case with the Murim Association.\nThe more interests one had, the more exposed their organization would be.\n‘The problem here is the MS group.’\nThe MS group, Chun Yeowun had no clue about them.\nIf one tried to divulge even the smallest information, their bodies melted.\nIt was difficult to even find clues regarding them, since they left no traces behind.\nBut things were different now.\n‘Memories of the dead.’\nA useful tool.\n‘Should I head to Hu Bong now?’\nChun Yeowun opened his energy senses and traced Hu Bong.\nNormally, Chun Yeowun could feel up to 2 km away, but since he reached Heavenly Master level, he could feel up to 15 km.\nOf course, he could sense farther too, but the farther it went the harder it was to know.\n‘Huh?’\nChun Yeowun frowned.\nHe thought that they would be within 2 km even if they went far.\nHowever, Hu Bong’s energy was coming from 13km to the south.\nIt was close to the outer wall.\n‘Already?... did he get into a car?’\nOtherwise, going that far with the survivors seemed impossible.\nHowever, it wasn’t just the survivors.\nThere were many energies around them.\nPhat!\nChun Yeowun immediately moved to that place.\nAbout 3 km from the south gate of the wall.\nTen military trucks and five aircraft were parked.\nAbout three hundred infantrymen had their machine rifles aimed at Hu Bong, Mun Ran-yeong and the other survivors.\n“How dare you do this to my son!”\nThe person who was shouting in anger towards them was Cho Hyung-mo, the head of Internal Security.\nNext to him was the commander, Mak Wu-cheong, who couldn’t hide his shock.\n‘Ha. I am going crazy!’\nMak Wu-cheong glanced behind him.\nThere was a dead body with blood all over it.\nIt was Cho Hyung-mo’s son, Cho Hyung-man, the head of the planning department of Datong city.\n‘How did this happen?’\nMak Wu-cheong shook his head.\nHow did it happen?\nIt started with the radio, which came in when the Gates were closing.\n[This is the latter group. The condition of the rescued one is critical.]\nMak Wo-cheong, who heard it, hastily formed a team and rushed for the wall to retrieve them.\nAnd when they arrived, the man was dead.\nHearing about what happened before and after the incident from the 4 warriors who brought the body, Cho Hyung-mo was angry.\n[He was killed by a warrior.]\nA warrior said it was a warrior who had seriously injured his son.\nThey said that they managed to escape because of the help from their leader Hong Pal-son and others who were fighting the Ghosts.\n[These bastards!]\nNaturally, Cho Hyung-mo asked the commander to arrest the people.\nBut an odd thing happened.\nA military truck with survivors had appeared from the same direction and the person who killed his son was in that truck.\n“Kill those bastards who killed my son, commander.”\nCho Hyung-mo recklessly insisted.\nAs a result, Hu Bong began to get angry.\n“Honey. It seems impossible to reason.”\n“Sigh…”\nMun Ran-yeong sighed at the situation.\nWhile leading the survivors, she found a military truck and brought them to the south Gate, which was the safest place.\nAnd once she dropped the people, she wanted to return to Chun yeowun, but then this happened.\n“Commander! What are you dazing around for! Give the order to kill them right away!”\nCho Hyung-mo yelled.\nCommander Mak Wu-cheong tried to calm him.\n“Chief. They are civilians, and with procedure, they need to be arrested and investigated…”\n“What nonsense are you saying! It is clear that he killed my son, what is the need for investigation? Five the order to kill!”\nAt Cho Hyung-mo’s words, Mak Wu-cheong was sweating.\nFull of anger for losing his son, the man was unreasonable.\n“If you act like this, I won’t stand still. Do you know that my junior is the deputy director of National Defense?”\nAt that, Mak Wu-cheong bit his lips.\nThis was the reason he couldn’t speak back to the man at all. It was because both departments were closely related.\nCho Hyung-mo was powerful.\n“What do you want to do?”\n“… I understand.”\nIn the end, he succumbed to the orders.\nHe didn’t want to bring down the honor of the National Guard in front of civilians, but he had no other way.\n“Chief. First, we have to at least get the civilians away.”\n“Huh!”\nCho Hyung-mo didn’t stop that.\nHe only wanted the one who killed his son to be killed.\nThe commander shouted to the civilians who were behind Hu Bong.\n“Datong city civilians, it might be dangerous, so please step away from that killer.”\nThe people were confused. A middle-aged man who couldn’t stand it said.\n“W-wait! There seems to be some misunderstanding on the Defense side.”\n“If you don’t move, you might get hurt.”\nAt Mak- Wu-cheong’s warning, the middle man asked Cho Hyung-mo by pointing to the dead man.\n“Are you that man’s father?”\n“Yes.”\nCho Hyung-mo calmed down and answered.\nAnd the middle-aged man said.\n“You say that you are the father, so I will say it. Your son was sexually harassing this man’s wife.”\nThe man bluntly said it.\nAt those words, Cho Hyung-mo’s face distorted.\nWho wouldn’t be shocked to hear that his son was killed as he sexually assaulted a woman?\n“W-what nonsense are you saying!”\nAt that time, the woman who was beaten by his son stepped up and said.\n“It is something we all saw. Your son molested this wife, and we were there. How can you even try to kill them without asking what happened?”\n“Right! You are all being too much!”\nThe survivors voiced their displeasure and defended Hu Bong.\nThey wanted to repay him for saving them.\n“Hmm.”\nHu Bong licked his lips at this new feeling which wasn’t bad.\nOn the other hand, Cho Hyun-mo didn’t like it.\nOne of the survivors said that his son harassed a woman and died.\nAs a parent, it was humiliating.\nGrunt!\nCho Hyung-mo grunted his teeth as he stared at the people collecting his son’s body.\nThe warriors who brought his body waved their hands.\n“We-we didn’t know!”\nThey were telling the truth. They were there after it happened and took the body out right away.\nThey had no idea what had happened.\n‘Did my son molest that girl?’\nCho Hyung-mo looked at Mun Ran-yeong. The woman had an alluring look with short hair. At the sight of her pale face and torn skirt, he clenched his fist.\n‘Hyung-man that bastard…’\nHe was the father of Cho Hyung-man.\nHe raised him till he was an adult, so he knew what kind of person his son was.\nEven before being the head of the planning department, his son was always in trouble with women.\nAnd it cost him millions of won to abort the kids he had with other women.\n‘I told him to be careful.’\nHe didn’t think that his son would touch a married woman when a Gate was open.\nIt was clear since the survivors were voicing it out.\nCommander Mak Wu-cheong had to change his decision and said.\n“Chief. It isn’t good to order a kill on sight so how about we hold a detailed investigation.”\n“Commander Mak.”\n“Yes.”\n“I am sorry, but save the face of my son this one time. If you help me, I will do my best to promote you.”\nAt those words, the commander frowned. Because he knew what the cause of this proposal was.\n“Chief…”\n“Kill them all.”\n“Chief!”\n“If you leave them alive, what will happen to my dead son’s pride and name?”\nThe man didn’t want civilians alive as they could speak all sorts of things about his son.\nAnd that would destroy his political career.\n“Since you are wearing a military uniform, you need to stand at the top. I will support you to become the head of the National Guard.”\nThe man kept whispering sweet words to the commander.\nThe commander was losing himself to the tempting idea.\n‘Shit.’\nThis was something which could raise him or break him.\nAnd the wrong decision would hurt his conscience.\nMak Wu-cheong opened his mouth in a troubled way.\n“Chief. I am the commander of a unit of the National Guard who protects the safety of citizens.”\nThe commander decided to uphold justice.\nHe could never point his guns at citizens.\nCho Hyung-mo sighed in disappointment.\n“Commander… sigh.”\n“I am sorry. I just can't…”\nBang!\n“Euk!”\nA bullet went through the commander’s thigh.\nClack! Clack!\n“W-what is this?”\nThe lieutenant and other people of the military pointed their guns at Cho Hyung-mo right away.\nIn Cho Hyung-mo’s hand, was a pistol with smoke oozing out.\n“C… chief!”\nMak Wu-cheong grabbed his thigh and glared at the man.\nCho Hyung-mo answered.\n“Isn’t it natural for a soldier who disobeys orders to be shot?”\nKiiik!\n“Uh?”\n“What is this?”\nAll the machine guns and the aircraft aimed at the National Guard.\nThe drivers in the tank tried to stop it, but the machines didn’t stop.\n“Did you think that I came to this place all alone?”\nAt those words, the lieutenant glared at the bodyguards of Cho Hyung-mo.\nThey weren’t simple bodyguards, but talented people.\n“Y-You are going too far! Chief!”\nMak Wu-cheong yelled at the man.\nNot caring, he shot the other thigh.\nbang!\n“Kuak!”\nAnd then spoke to the lieutenant.\n“I will give you a chance, lieutenant Oh-pil. Will you be acting stupid like your head? Or will you listen to orders and get a higher position like a General?”\nAt the pistol aimed at him, Oh-pil turned scared.\n‘General?’\nAny soldier would dream of wearing that badge.\nOh-pil’s gaze looked at the machine guns, tanks and aircraft aimed at them and Mak Wu-cheong who was in pain.\nThere were very few options.\nIf he refused, then it would be death.\n“Don’t make me do this. If you accept my offer, you can shoot your commander in the head with your own hands.”\n“T-that…”\n“So we aren’t on the same boat?”\nCho Hyung-mo said it casually.\nIt was like a devil whispering.\n“It is the same for you all. If you complete this task, then I will give you all a promotion.”\nAt Cho Hyung-mo’s sweet suggestion, the officers aiming their guns lowered them.\nAnd that made Cho Hyung-mo smile.\nAt that, commander Mak yelled at Oh-pil.\n“Ouch, what are you all doing! If you give in to the wrong side and shoot innocent civilian…”\nClank!\n“Y… you?”\nOh-pil aimed his gun at the commander. And spoke to the bewildered man.\n“Are civilians more important in life and death situations than allies?”\n“Kuak. Don’t say such things!”\n“Don’t blame me, sir. I cannot sacrifice three hundred allies for 20 civilians.”\n“That is what the National Guard was made for.”\n“I did nothing wrong.”\nWith that, he pulled the trigger.\nbang!\nAnd then, it happened.\nWheik!\n‘!!!’\nThe bullet stopped mid-air and continued to spin.\nA little bit further, and it would have pierced the commander’s head.\n“W-what is this?”\nOh-pil couldn’t hide his shock at that. It was the same with Commander Mak.\n“Bullet is…”\nAn unfamiliar voice was heard.\n“I really liked it. Do not ever give up your faith.”\n‘!?’\nShhh!\nAnd someone appeared next to him like a Ghost.\n“Lord!”\nHu Bong shouted with a bright face.\nIt was Chun Yeowun.\n“W-who!”\nOh-pil aimed his gun at Chun Yeowun.\nChun Yeowun just snapped his finger.\nPuck!\n“Kuak!.”\nThe bullet which stopped flew back and stuck the lieutenant in his forehead.\nWhen the man collapsed, the others aimed their guns at Chun Yeowun, but not a single person could pull the trigger.\n“What are you waiting for! Shoot him!”\nCho Hyung-mo screamed at them.\nBut no matter how hard they tried, they couldn’t pull the trigger.\n“I can’t shoot!”\n“What nonsense is that…”\nAt that time, Chun Yeowun raised his finger at three officers.\nCrack!\nThe three of them suddenly got their necks cracked.\nTheir death was fast, but terrifying to those who watched it.\n“Eik!”\nCho Hyung-mo, who was scared, tried to move away.\nThe bodyguards protecting him reached ahead to stop Chun Yeowun by using their abilities, but.\nShh!\nWhen Chun Yeowun waved his hand, their waists were bent at a weird angle.\nCrack!\n“Kuak!”\nTheir spine was bent back, so there was no way they could live.\nThe two of them struggled and trembled before they died.\nThat frightened Cho Hyung-mo even more as he tried to run away, when Chun Yeowun appeared in front of him.\nShhh!\n“Where are you going?”\n“Euk!”\nStartled, he fell back as if he saw a ghost.",

      "content": "Chapter 93: Sky Demon Order (1)\nCho Hyung-mo was terrified and shouted at the National Guards.\n“Wh-what are you all looking at! Shoot him!”\nClack!\nAbout three hundred infantrymen, who weren’t even sure whose orders they were supposed to follow anymore, aimed their guns at Chun Yeowun.\nThe problem, however, was that there were survivors between Chun Yeowun and the infantry.\n“Kyaaak!”\n“S-stop!”\nThe bewildered survivors screamed and crouched in order not to get hit.\nAt that moment, a huge wall of flame appeared in front of the infantry.\nWheik!\n“Ahhh!”\n“Flame!?”\nIt was Hu Bong.\nEven before Chun Yeowun had appeared, he was getting ready to fight them all.\n“Who dares touch my Lord!”\nThe infantrymen were blocked by the flames.\n“Your sin is to wish death upon my Lord.”\nHu Bong reached out his hand, and the flame wall covered the entire infantry.\nThere was no way that infantry, which was made of normal humans, could stop that.\n“Kuak!”\n“Spare me!”\n“F-flame!”\nIn an instant, the entire place turned into a sea of flame.\nThose inside the flame screamed in fear.\nIt was hell.\n‘What is this…’\nCho Hyung-mo couldn’t believe what was happening in front of his eyes.\nTwo people able to annihilate the entire force.\n‘I need to run away.’\nCho Hyung-mo, who thought that, staggered as he got up.\nWas it true that the body could move if the will to live existed?\nHis body rose right away.\n‘!?’\nBut unfortunately, it didn’t rise because of his will.\n“I-I can’t move…”\nIt was due to Chun Yeowun.\nStep step.\n“Eik!”\nWhen Chun Yeowun approached him, fear overwhelmed Cho Hyung-mo.\n“I am the head of the Internal Security, which is under the council. If you want anything, I can give it to you. Money or power or anything.”\n“Father and son are so similar.”\nAt those words, Cho Hyung-mo yelled.\n“If you kill me! A member of the government, then you are…”\nGrab!\n“Who would even care about your death?”\n“What?”\nPuk!\nChun Yeowun’s fingers pierced the man’s neck.\n“Cough!”\nShhhh!\nA blue-colored light flowed from the black wrist guard on Chun Yeowun's right hand.\nThe light went into the holes in Cho Hyung-mo’s neck, and his life was sucked out.\n“Kuak!”\nHis skin turned pale white as if he was killed by a Ghost.\nShhh!\nA Ghost would soon come out of the body.\n‘I need to get rid of it.’\nAs his hand reached out to the falling body, the wrist guard trembled.\nAnd the Ghost dispersed before it formed.\n‘Oh!’\nIt was possible to annihilate the Ghosts without even doing much.\nThis seemed extremely convenient.\n“Then.”\nChun Yeowun approached commander Mak who was on the ground.\nWith bullets in both his thighs, he was in pain and pale from the bleeding.\nThe pain must have been unbearable, but probably because he was a commander, he kept enduring it.\nWith a pale face, commander Mak asked Chun Yeowun.\n“Are you going to kill me too?”\nChun Yeowun smiled at that.\n“I like you.”\nAnd he reached out to the wounded area.\nAnd.\nZzzz!\n“Kuak!”\nThe two bullets lodged inside the commander’s thighs were pulled out.\nChun Yeowun, who brought out the bullets, threw them away.\nTatatak!\nAnd when he sealed the blood points on the thighs, the bleeding stopped.\nAfter that, Chun Yeowun snapped his finger.\nWheik!\nJiiik!\n“Ack!”\nFlames flickered around the wounded area.\nAt the pain, Mak Wu-cheong groaned in pain.\n“You won't die right away now.”\n“Ah…”\nAt those words, Mak Wu-cheong looked at his wounds.\nIn an instant, the bullets were out, and the wounds were sealed.\nBut this was just a temporary measure.\nAs a soldier, he knew that a bullet shot had to be given medical treatment.\n“Why are you saving me?”\nPuzzled, Mak Wu-cheong asked.\n“It is a waste to leave someone like you to die here.”\nThe man was lucky.\nIf he didn’t stand up for his beliefs, he would have died like the others.\n“What if I decide to go out and open my mouth?”\n“Then I must have misunderstood you.”\nAt that answer, Mak Wu-cheong’s eyes fluttered.\nMen sometimes had emotional changes in the most strange situations.\nHe was recognized by an unknown stranger, but that pleased his heart.\nTak!\nMak Wu-cheong put his hands together and bowed to Chun Yeowun.\n“I heard that warriors express gratitude like this.”\nHe wanted to get up and thank him, but his legs were both wounded, and he couldn’t risk getting up.\n“Well, no need. I just did that on a whim.”\nWith that, Chun Yeowun turned his back, no longer interested.\nMak Wu-cheong hurriedly said to him.\n“I want to repay the favor! Please tell me! I would like to help you in whatever way I can.”\nWhen Chun Yeowun turned around, the man looked very friendly.\nHe seemed to really care.\n‘Was he the commander of the National Guard?’\nChun Yeowun looked at him.\nIf he was a commander, then he must be someone in the line to be a major.\nIn addition, with the achievement of closing an S-class Gate, the man would be more famous.\n‘It might be worth it.’\nChun Yeowun wasn’t interested in the government at all.\nBut seeing this man, he changed his thoughts.\nThe man looked useful.\n‘Nano. Are you done?’\n[The function you mentioned has been modified.]\nThe timing was good. Chun Yeowun approached the man.\n“Show me your hand.”\n“Hand?”\nAt the unexpected request, he held out his hand.\nChun Yeowun raised the energy and wounded the palm.\nMak Wu-cheong frowned at the stinging pain.\nChun Yeowun placed a finger on the palm and lifted it.\n“Done.”\nThe man didn’t know what was done.\nHowever, he heard Chun Yeowun’s voice in his mind.\n[Can you hear me?]\n“Uh?”\nIt was strange.\nChun Yeowun clearly didn’t open his mouth, but he heard him talking.\n[When you want to talk to me, think strongly.]\nHe wasn’t sure if it was possible, but commander Mak wanted to try it.\nAnd when he thought of wanting to talk, he felt something strange tickle his head.\n[Can you hear me? Can you hear me? You can hear this?]\n[I hear you.]\n“Gasp!”\nMak Wu-cheong couldn’t hide his shock.\nBecause he was in the National Guard, he always got to experience the new communication devices, but this was a first.\n“H-how…”\n“You don’t need to know.”\nKnowing wouldn’t do him any good either.\nThe man’s brain now had a modified nano bomb.\nNano, which remodeled the nano bomb particles, made it easy to track and communicate.\nThis seemed like a great strength to use.\n‘Not knowing gives you peace.’\nHis head would explode any time if he recklessly decided to disclose what he spoke with Chun Yeowun.\nTo the surprised man, Chun Yeowun said.\n“You said you wanted to repay the favor?”\n“Y-yes.”\n“Then let’s make a deal to help each other.”\n“Deal?”\nMak Wu-cheong was puzzled.\n“What is it?”\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun opened the bag and showed him something.\nThe S-class core in it made Mak Wu-cheong’s eyes glow bright.\n“The core!”\nHe still couldn’t figure out what the deal was.\n“You caught the S-class core?”\n“Yes.”\nAt those words, Mak Wu-cheong grew excited.\nIt hadn’t been long since the Gate was destroyed, so he was curious who did it.\n“What about the team?”\n“I caught it myself.”\n“The Alpha, all alone?”\nThe commander turned speechless.\nHe knew that Gate Keepers and warriors had abilities.\nBut they had limits too.\nEven an A-class core was tough to catch without assistance.\n‘Did he do something almost impossible even for an S-class Gate Keeper?’\nIf someone else had said it, he wouldn’t have believed it.\nWho would even believe that an S-class Alpha was caught by one person?\n“Only you need to know this.”\nAt those words, commander Mak nodded his head.\n“The deal is simple. Let me know if any A-class or S-class Gates open in the future. I want to come.”\n“T-that is all?”\nThis was a simple suggestion. And commander Mak would be the one gaining from it.\nChun Yeowun said it lightly, but it was as if this man had promised to take care of the A-class and S-class Gates, the worst disasters.\n“That will help you too.”\n“Help me?”\nClosing an A-class Gate was treated as public service.\nAnd in the case of an S-class Gate, which was impossible to close, even a promotion could be given.\nIt was more like being helped than making a deal.\n“One more thing. We need something like a permission for me and my subordinates to freely roam when the Gates open.”\n“… so you are not a member of the Association or a registered Murim?”\nIf they belonged to the Murim Association, then they could all freely participate.\nOf course, it all happened under the guidance and control of the National Guard.\n“I don’t belong to the Murim Association.”\n“Ah!”\n“And I don’t like people controlling me.”\nWhat Chun Yeowun wanted was to roam freely without anyone intervening during the Gate opening.\nHe could sneak in, but it would be a mess if he got caught.\n‘You want to participate in the Gate wars independently.’\nNow that was tricky.\nIt would’ve been a different story if it was Chun Yeowun alone, but he mentioned something about subordinates.\nThe Murim Department of the State council strictly controlled the Murim warriors under them and blocked individual participation.\n“The first is possible if I write a report… but the second one comes under the Ministry of Murim, and it might be difficult.”\nThe Ministry of Murim had extreme power.\nAnd had policies like other departments.\nHowever, the Defense couldn't get involved with the Murims, since friction could rise.\n“Are you being on caution because of the Murims?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words which were close to provocation, Mak Wu-cheong frowned.\nA line that no department would ever cross.\nPolitics is what it is.\n“L-let me be honest. When the Gate happens, we need all the power we can from the Murim warriors. But it is the Ministry of Murim which has all the powers.”\nSo each department kept a close eye on another.\nIt was impossible to close the Gate with just the Gate Keepers, especially with Alphas.\n“It is a policy of the Ministry of Murim that those who aren’t registered cannot participate in the Gate. As you said, granting the right to participate in the war as individuals would be denied by the ministry.”\n‘He must be smart.’\nChun Yeowun shook his head.\nThis policy was made to exert influence over the Defense.\n“The answer is simple.”\n“Huh?”\n“Without being on the side of the Murim Association or of the Ministry of Murim, there should be an organization that could support the Gate problem in close connection with the Ministry of National Defense.”\n“Right, but…”\nMak Wu-cheong couldn’t keep up with this.\nThe Ministry of Muirm had a Murim Department, which handled over 2 thousand associations.\nIt wouldn’t be easy for the Ministry of National Defense to accept an organization unless it was on the same level as the Murim Association.\n“It might be difficult. But arrange a meeting with the head of National Defense.”\n“Are you talking about the director of the Ministry of National Defense?”\nWhen the request grew bigger, commander Mak went pale.\n“Although you might be right, unless your organization is on the same level as the Murim Association, it wouldn’t obtain approval…”\nCommander Mak thought of Chun Yeowun’s side to be a small group.\nChun Yeowun said.\n“What are you so afraid of?”\n“Aren't you taking this too easy…”\nShhh!\nBefore he could finish it, Chun Yeowun stretched out his hand, and held the air like holding a sword.\nPach-chik!\nA dazzling black light flashed around, and an invisible sword appeared.\nIt was the invisible sword of Black Thunder qi.\nOf Thunder qi and Sky Demon energy.\n“Wh-what is this?”\nPuzzled by the sudden action, he asked, but Chun Yeowun pointed to somewhere with the sword.\nA mountain range stretched to the northwest side within the wall.\nPachik!\nAt that moment, a tremendous amount of black lightning flew to one point.\nPapak!\nThe rays of lightning, which passed through air, went for the mountain.\nKwakwakwang!\nA huge hole was drilled within the mountain.\nThe hole was so wide that everyone could see the other side.\nMak Wu-cheong was so shocked that he couldn’t close his mouth.\n‘N-no way!’\nWas it possible to do that?\nA single human showed a destructive power that no military machine could perform.\nChun Yeowun looked at Mak Wu-cheong.\n“What about the Murim Association?”\nMak Wu-cheong looked at the man in awe.\nThis man was never arrogant.\nThis man knew what he could do.\n“… what should I tell the director of the Ministry of National Defense about the organization you are running?”\nChun Yeowun smiled and answered.\n“Sky Demon Order.”",

      "content": "Chapter 94: Sky Demon Order (2)\nHu Bong couldn’t stop being restless and kept on wandering around.\nHis gaze was unable to stop at any particular place.\nWheik!\nThe inside of the cave where Hu Bong was looking had been in flames for over an hour now.\nSo he was full of concern.\n“Hu Bong. Be calm.”\n“Euk! Yes!”\nOnly after hearing Chun Yeowun’s words did Hu Bong stand still.\nOf course, that didn’t last very long.\nHu Bong’s body moved again, and he was just as restless as before.\nSoon, the flames in the cave subsided a little.\nAnd someone appeared from inside.\nIt was Mun Ran-yeong.\n“Honey!”\nHu Bong ran to her with tears in his eyes.\n‘I am not getting used to this.’\nChun Yeowun was shocked each time he saw this different appearance of Hu Bong.\nMun Ran-yeong seemed different when she came out of the cave.\nHer hair, which was dyed in black, was now blazing red like Hu Bong’s.\nBesides, her hair grew long.\nIn addition, the contours on her face were much clearer, and it seemed like she looked even younger.\n‘She seems to have been through metamorphosis of skeletal bones.’\nMetamorphosis.\nIt referred to the reconstruction of bones and muscles into the best version of the body.\nHowever, it is probably right to say that she didn’t change because of a growth in level, but her body just returned to the previous state because of gaining strength.\nKneel!\n“My Lord.”\nAvoiding Hu Bong’s hug, Mun Ran-yeong kneeled to Chun Yeowun.\n“Thanks to you, I am back to normal.”\nMun Ran-yeong had taken the blood of the Flame Qilin and regained her power.\nHer eyes were not confident. And the aura she was emanating was unusual.\n‘It feels good, but…’\nChun Yeowun was surprised.\nHe thought that it was strange for her body to have undergone changes when she hadn’t attained any enlightenment.\nEven if she was at the beginning of Supreme Master level, this is much different from what he experienced, she was stronger, and he could feel it.\n“You have made a lot of progress, Great Elder.”\n“You are being too generous.”\nShe was originally a Supreme Master.\nEven in the past, she was on the same level as the Five Great Warriors, but now, except for Chun Yeowun, there seemed like no one else could compete with her.\nTherefore, even if her Dantian was damaged, she could still defeat those targeting her.\n‘This is enough.’\nHu Bong and Mun Ran-yeong.\nWith those two joining him, he knew that his orders would be carried safely.\nAlthough Chun Yeowun himself was the strongest here, there were few adherents in the Sky Demon Order of this era.\nThere were many warriors who were strong, and the strategies one used were diversified.\n“Great Elder.”\n“Yes. Lord Chun Ma.”\nShe confidently answered him.\n“Put some clothes on.”\n“Ah…”\nHer face turned red.\nIt was normal for all her clothes to be burned when metamorphosis happened.\nFortunately, Chun Yeowun, who knew that, predicted the burning of clothes and prepared an extra pair of clothes for her.\n“Honey. Here.”\nChuk!\nHu Bong brought the clothes to her.\nMun Ran-yeong smiled at her young husband and quickly put on her clothes.\nChun Yeowun then asked her.\n“Are you done?”\n“Yes.”\n“Now extend both your arms.”\n“Huh?”\nMun Ran-yeong was puzzled by that.\nHu Bong said with a crying face.\n“Honey. You might want to defend yourself with internal energy.”\n“What do you mean?”\nEventually, she understood why Hu Bong said that.\nChun Yeowun, who was in a nano suit, hugged the two of them and flew at 13 Mach speed.\nPapapang!\n‘My face!’\nIt was the first time she experienced such pain in her face.\nYongchun Group headquarters in Jinan city.\nIn a small meeting room, the executives have gathered.\nSomeone was receiving the reports in awe.\n“Is that true?”\nIt was the chairman Chun Yu-jang.\nThe person reporting to him was Bi Mak-heon, the vice-chairman’s assistant.\nBi Mak-heon had reported what had happened in the recent meeting.\nHaving heard about it, Chun Yu-jang went still.\n‘Chun Yu-seong and his faction were wiped up.’\nHe thought that since they were all descendants, they would be punished and not killed.\nHowever, no exceptions were made.\n‘… I must never have ill intentions towards my ancestor.’\nEven if they were descendants, there was no mercy in his heart.\nHe thought that Chun Yeowun would excuse them for the sake of uniting the Cult, but everyone was killed.\n‘This is the Demon God.’\nThe legend who created the second great Sky Demon Order.\nHe knew that there was a lot of blood spilled behind that legend, but no one knew the truth.\nAnd now, since they heard it first hand, not just Chun Yu-jang but all the other executives were afraid of Chun Yeowun once again,\n“As expected, Master is wonderful.”\nThe only one who liked this side of Chun Yeowun was the secretary, Shakena.\n“Cough”\nBi Mak-heon didn’t say anything to them.\nHe wasn’t sure how the executives would react if he said that this woman had eaten up the bodies of the Chun Yu-seong faction.\n‘This woman is more frightening.’\nChun Yeowun is the head of the Sky Demon Order.\nBut this woman was different.\nHer identity wasn’t a human, but a demon, a special type entity from Gate.\n‘I need to give separate advice to the chairman and the executives later.’\nHe was afraid that they could get into trouble with Shakena.\nAnd only Chun Yeowun could control her.\nThen Shakena abruptly got up from her seat and walked to the window.\n“Hmm?”\nEveryone was curiously looking at her.\n“Master... is coming.”\nWith those words, she put her palm on the window.\nAnd the window turned transparent.\nShhhh!\nThree people passed through it.\n“Lord Chun Ma!”\nIt was Chun Yeowun, Hu Bong and Mun Ran-yeong.\nChun Yu-jang and the others got up startled and then bowed on the floor at the same time.\nChun Yeowun never seemed to have entered through the entrance.\n“Vice-chairman.”\nHis secretary Yu So-hwa approached him and bowed.\nShe was currently adjusting to the predictable behavior of Chun Yeowun.\n“Hey. Master!”\nShakena tried to hug Chun Yeowun, but Mun Ran-yeong stopped her.\n“Get away.”\nShakena glared at the woman with an anguished expression.\n“Human bitch. What is with you?”\n‘It is starting again.’\nYu So-hwa, who was watching, shook her head.\nBut like Shakena, she was curious about the two people too.\nFrom the eyebrows to hair, everything on their bodies was red, like a blazing flame.\nAnd it looked natural, not dyed.\n“Huh.”\nShakena’s body turned invisible to some extent.\nShe reached out to Mun Ran-yeong to threaten her.\n“I told you to get away.”\nMun Ran-yeong tried to grab her hand.\nHowever, due to the ability of phasing, Mun Ran-yeong’s hand passed through.\n“Oh?”\n“If you don’t move, I will pull your heart out. Human.”\nSaying that, she reached out to Mun Ran-yeong’s chest.\nAt that moment, Mun Ran-yeong’s hand, which was red in heat, hit Shakena on her chest.\nWheik!\n“Ah! Hot!”\nShakena was startled and stepped back.\nShe thought that her phasing ability would damage her, but heat seemed to work on her.\nShake!\nShe couldn’t understand, so she looked at Mun Ran-yeong’s hand.\nThe air around her hand seemed to be hazing because of the heat.\nAs a current Divine Master, she too was able to freely control her surroundings.\nAs a result, she was able to transmit heat to Shakena’s body.\n“You are strong.”\nShakena’s eyes were filled with joy.\nDue to her war-like nature, she wanted to see who was superior.\n“Let’s try again.”\nShakena rushed like lightning towards Mun Ran-yeong and tried to kick her.\nBut there was one thing that Shakena didn’t know.\nMun Ra-yeong was a member of the Dragon Fist clan.\nSaaa!\nMun Ran-yeong was already prepared and then made sure to bounce off the foot of Shakena with her palm.\nShe then grabbed the head and slammed it into the ground.\nShhhh!\n“Ack!”\nShe had no choice but to stop the phasing ability as the heat was being transmitted into her head.\nBang!\nHer head was violently smashed into the ground.\nWithout the ability of phasing, she was not able to cope with the Divine Master, Mun Ran-yeong.\nHer power was nothing in front of Mun Ran-yeong.\n“Don’t delude yourself. Chun Ma is not someone who cares for you.”\nMun Ran-yeong warned Shakena, whose head was stuck to the floor.\n‘She can’t handle a Divine Master level.’\nChun Yeowun smiled as his guess turned out right.\nNormally, he would have ordered Shakena to stop running wild, but he left her alone this time to show her that there were others who could subdue her.\n‘Just a little more awakening and Great Elder…’\nThen she would be able to control the entire space around her and not just the space around the body.\nOf course, for that to happen, she would have to be at the peak of Divine Master level.\n‘Got what you deserved.’\nYu So-hwa’s lips twitched.\nShe barely held herself from laughing.\nShe always wanted to see that demon suffer, and it was undoubtedly refreshing.\nAs her pride was hurt in front of everyone, she thought that Shakena would lay low for a while.\nThud!\nShakena jumped up from the floor and grabbed Mun Ran-yeong’s hand with sparkling eyes.\n“I’ll accept you as my sister.”\nShe seemed to recognize Mun Ran-yeong as her older sister.\nDue to the nature of demons, they wanted to be close to people stronger than them.\n‘Ahh…’\nYu So-hwa felt upset again.\nYongchun’s Group’s conference room was full of surprises.\nChun Yu-jang and the other executives who found out about Hu Bong and Mun Ran-yeong thought they were losing their minds.\nWhat was more interesting was their reaction to Hu Bong rather than Mun Ran-yeong.\n“Flame Hu Bong!”\n“Demon God’s right arm!”\n“Burning swordsman!”\nTitles kept flowing out from the executives’ mouths.\nAlthough Chun Yeowun didn’t realize it, Hu Bong, as his right hand, had performed so many tasks after he disappeared.\nHe was more famous than any other member of the Cult.\nOf course, the title of the right hand, which served Chun Yeowun, the Demon God, played a huge role.\n“Ahem.”\nHu Bong, who was unfamiliar with the titles the future descendants were giving him, was flustered.\nBut he slowly began to feel proud.\n‘… these are better than Bong Bong.’\nChun Yeowun wasn’t shocked by these new titles.\nLooking at Hu Bong, he could see how much he had changed and improved.\n‘Ahh!’\nThe eyes of Bi Mak-heon, looking at Hu Bong, were filled with ecstasy.\nHu Bong had a reputation for using the Sword of Illusion from the Illusion Sword Clan.\nAnd it was a natural reaction when he met the most famous figure in the clan.\n“Hu Bong.”\n“Yes, Lord!”\n“Bi Mak-heon is a descendant of the Illusion Sword clan.”\n“Oh-oh! Is that true?”\n“Teach him everything and make him useful.”\n“Alright, Lord.”\nBi Mak-heon was moved by Chun Yeowun’s words and fell flat on the ground.\n“L-Lord Chun Ma! This is such a blessing!”\nThe man was genuinely happy as he seemed to be crying.\nChun Yeowun looked at the room where the entire air seemed heated because of Hu Bong and Mun Ran-yeong.\nEveryone focused on him.\n“Now is the time.”\n“What do you mean by that?”\nAt Chun Yu-jang’s careful question, Chun Yeowun opened his mouth.\n“Now that we have sorted out the rest of the group, we will unite the Cult by gathering the members.”\n“Huh? To bring in the rest of the group…”\n“Are you seriously asking me because you can’t get what I am saying?”\nChun Yu-jang’s eyes trembled at that.\nHe did hear that the Chun Yu-seong faction, one of the three factions, had collapsed 20 minutes ago.\nHowever, according to what Chun Yeowun said, he wanted to bring in the last remaining people in the Chun Yu-seong faction.\nChun Yu-jang cleared his thoughts and then opened his mouth.\n“A… ancestor, is it fine to ask one question?”\n“Tell me.”\n“What happened to Chun Woo-kyung?”\n“You should know what happens to those who pretend to be Chun Ma.”\n‘!!!’\nNot just Chun Yu-jang, but all the other executives went silent.\nChun Woo-kyung lost his life too.\nIn the end, the fact that the two heads of the three factions were dead.\n‘I am the only one alive?’\nThe only candidate left was Chun Yu-jang.\nThis meant that the 27 years-long war between the 3 factions had come to an end.\n‘He did all this in just a few days…’\nIt was so shocking.\nEverything was sorted out so quickly, although they have been quarreling for so many years.\n‘Is this… the ability of those who have power?’\nAnd Chun Yeowun showed them all this directly.\nHow much a strong person could achieve.\nAnd when they all saw that, Chun Yu-jang realized what he was lacking as the Lord.\n‘I am not good enough.’\nIf he was Chun Yu-jang of the past, he would have just been happy that the situation was resolved.\nBut now, he was embarrassed.\nNow he was blaming himself for not achieving this with his own strength, and having to lean on Chun Yeowun.\nThud!\nChun Yu-jang knelt and said.\n“Ancestor… I am extremely ashamed. I came to realize that I amount to nothing.”\nChun Yu-jang bowed with tears in his eyes.\nAnd silence reigned in the room.\nTheir leader realized his weakness and accepted the truth.\nChun Yeowun opened his mouth.\n“You are lucky.”\n“Yes?”\n“If you showed joy and happiness, I was going to take you down too.”\n‘!?’\nHearing Chun Yeowun’s words, Chun Yu-jang felt his heart drop.\nChun Yeowun was not someone who would lie or spout useless nonsense.\nCold sweat dripped down.\nChachaca!\nIt was then, the sound of iron clashing was heard.\nHe looked up to see the Sky Demon sword.\n‘Sky demon Sword?’\nChun Yu-jang flinched as he was frightened.\nIt seemed like the Sky Demon Sword was being brought out to kill him.\nBut.\n“I hope that you will cherish what you have realized. When I think that you are not suitable anymore, then you will come down from the position at any time.”\n“… the position?”\nShhh!\n“Ah?”\nChun Yeowun held the dazzling Sky Demon Sword above his head.\nAnd spoke in a low voice.\n“I, Chun Yeowun, the 2nd Chun Ma and the 24th Lord of the Great Sky Demon Order appoint Chun Yu-jang, who inherited the great lineage of Chun, as the Sub Lord of the Cult.”",

      "content": "Chapter 95: Core Refining Machine (1)\n‘Sub Lord?’\nAll the executives were surprised at the unexpected promotion.\nA second ago, the man seemed enraged, but now, he appointed someone as the Sub Lord.\nThe executives should’ve been happy, but they were as shocked as Chun Yu-jang.\nChun Yu-jang opened his mouth.\nBut nothing came out.\n“Why aren’t you saying anything? Isn’t it admirable to be a Sub Lord at this age?”\nOnly when he heard the words of Chun Yeowun did he come back to his senses.\nAlthough he realized that he had shortcomings, Chun Yeowun, the legend of the Cult, appointed him as the Sub Lord.\n‘Who else can get this glory!’\nChun Yu-jang bowed and cried out.\n“I will not disappoint you!”\n“I hope you do.”\nChun Yu-jang was appointed as the Sub Lord of the Sky Demon order, which was a vacant position for a long time.\nIn a way, he was fortunate.\nUnlike the heads of the other two factions, he didn’t think of playing tricks and acknowledged the existence of Chun Yeowun right away.\n“Okay then, let’s continue the meeting?”\nTak!\nChun Yeowun sat down at the top seat.\nThe executives who were standing also sat down.\nChun Yu-jang got up and sat in his seat.\nHis heart, however, was still full of boiling emotions.\n“Let’s start with the problem of merging everything into the Cult.”\nThe meeting went smoothly.\nThe agenda was to unite all the factions into one Cult.\nThe PPT material was prepared in advance by Huan Myung-oh and was played out.\nHe pointed to the graph illuminating on the wall with a laser pen and explained.\n“If you look at the graph, you can see that the main Cult is a branch of this company.”\nThere were a total of 40 companies.\nAfter the dissolution of Black Sky Company, the Cult was divided into 3 factions, and two factions managed to create notable companies in the business world.\nChun Woo-kyung was an exception since he ran an organization with small to medium-sized enterprises and venture companies.\n“Among the listed groups, 13 companies have significantly higher stock prices.”\n“Mergers and acquisitions will be difficult.”\nThe people mumbled at that.\nThere were different types of mergers.\nThe most common form was that a large company would buy a small one, but funds were the problem.\n“So what’s your plan?”\n“A new merger of affiliates of the same type.”\nThe Yongchun and the Chunshin group, which had multiple subsidiaries, had similarly oriented affiliates under them.\nThe same was true for SMEs and venture companies.\nAnd merging similar ones would reduce the financial burden.\n“But it will take quite a lot of time compared to normal mergers.”\nIt was because this required the persuasion of each company’s shareholders.\nIf the company merged, then it was the duty of the higher company to convince them that their company would grow bigger once it came under their company.\nAnd that wasn’t an easy task.\n“Complicated.”\nChun Yeowun clicked his tongue saying that.\nUnlike anything else which seemed simple in the modern world, the process of merging was too complicated.\nThere were too many restrictions starting with tax issues.\nBut it didn’t matter.\nThe corporate matters were the executives’ responsibilities.\n“And how long will it take?”\n“Since we haven’t even started the negotiations with the Chunshin group, if we start it now, it would take around a year.”\nAt Huan Myung-oh’s words, Chun Yeowun said.\n“Too long.”\n“A few required permit reports from the IRS and the economic commission from the government. This cannot be completed in a short time because there are screening and verification processes.”\nThe others nodded in agreement.\nA merger of a small company would end with a small bride, but it was tougher since the company they wanted to merge was huge.\nNaturally, the bribing won’t work as huge companies were under the watch of the Chinese government.\n“Huan Myung-oh.”\n“Yes. Lord.”\n“What you told me now is the normal procedure. Which means that there is another way, right?”\nHuan Myung-oh responded to Chun Yeowun’s words.\n“Right.”\n“Then what is the problem?”\n“The Ministry of Murim and the Murim Association have connections with economic organizations, including the state council. They will surely obstruct us when we try to merge.”\nIf all the companies affiliated with the Sky Demon Order were merged, the growth potential would be enough for the Cult to enter into the top 20 businesses.\nThat would definitely cause trouble for the Murim Association.\n“Pathetic ones.”\nChun Yeowun clicked his tongue in disappointment.\nEven with the Imperial Family not controlling Murim anymore, the Murim Association was now stepping in his way.\n“I apologize.”\n“Chun Yu-jang. Huan Myung-oh.”\n“Yes. Ancestor!”\n“Yes. Lord!”\nChun Yeowun called the two of them.\n“I will give you three months. Get the consultation and the merging of the Wangshin and the Chunshin group within that time.”\n“Huh? L-Lord. To make it happen so fas…”\n“It is up to you people to make it happen.”\nNot just Huan Myung-oh, but even Chun Yu-jang was perplexed at that.\nIf a person knew a little bit of management, then one would know how unreasonable that was.\nChun Yu-jang looked at Chun Yeowun’s eyes.\n‘Ahh. Ancestor is testing us again.’\nTesting him again.\nHearing unreasonable demands, he remembered his father, Lord Chun Woo-jin.\nChun Woo-jin, who left the Black Sky Company, never gave the executives easy tasks.\nPerhaps the one leading the group hopes for those following him to be capable.\nWith a confident look, Chun Yu-jang said.\n“I’ll do it.”\nThe faces of executives, including Huan Myung-oh, were distorted.\nChun Yeowun warned.\n“I know better than anyone how you all stayed at this level only. If you say that something is difficult from now on, I will judge that you are not worthy of the position you are in.”\n‘!!!’\nThe faces of the executive turned pale.\n“Answer!”\nHu Bong yelled with a loud voice.\n“Yes!!”\nLooking at them, Mun Ran-yeong and Hu Bong shook their heads.\nTheir anticipation for the future descendants ended up with disappointment.\n‘They need mental training.’\nHu Bong vowed to get everything done.\nBut he knew that Chun Yeowun wasn’t the kind to leave the matter in others’ hands.\n“I will take care of the Murim association.”\n“Ah!”\nAt those words, Chun yu-jang and the executives smiled.\nIf the checks on the company were stopped, then they could get the task done.\nHowever, that didn’t mean that all their problems were solved.\n‘To deal with the Murim Association means to deal with the entire Murim.’\nThe Jinan Murim Association handled the Gate battles.\nAnd that was why the Cult was never able to respond to battles.\nHowever, the association had already realized that the Cult was moving, so they would do everything in their power to stop them from rising.\nIn other words, it meant war.\n‘Maybe I need to prepare!’\n‘It is war with them!’\nAfter 27 years, the battle between the Sky Demon Order and Murim was finally going to happen.\nSurprisingly, the concerns of the past turned into determination.\nThe 27-year-old grudge engraved in their bones.\n‘Huh!’\nSeeing that, Chun Yeowun smiled.\nHe was going to warn them if they showed weakness, but that didn’t seem necessary.\n“Hang Yu-rin.”\n“Yes, Lord.”\n“I will give you a different mission.”\n“Yes.”\n“Take the information from the info group under Huan Myung-oh and merge the information side with the Chunshin Group.”\nHuan Myung-oh was flustered at those words.\n“Lord. The info group…”\nHe was the one who had been handling the information gathering.\nAnd when he was asked to give the management rights to someone else, he felt bad.\n“I am not getting rid of your rights.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“They are to hand over the intelligence and information in charge of finding the Lord, to Hang Yu-rin.”\n“Ah…”\nHuan Myung-oh felt relieved at that.\nOnce the merger process started, Huan Myung-oh wouldn’t be able to handle everything.\nChun Yeowun was trying to make Hang Yu-rin work on it in the meantime.\n“After 10 days, when the training in the Chunshin group is done, the Great Guardian will come here. Get all the information about that secret prison from him.”\n‘Ah!’\nFor 27 years, the Great Guardian had been tracking the whereabouts of the Lord.\nAnd his data would be even more massive than the two factions.\nIn conclusion, Chun Yeowun asked her to gather all the information and see the tracking process.\n“Yes!”\n“I will give you two months. Find the current Lord.”\n“Yes! I will definitely find him!”\nPak!\nShe knelt down and bowed.\nFinding their Lord was something they have always been longing for.\nOnce everything was done, Chun Yeowun asked Yu So-hwa to bring something.\nThat was.\n“Core!”\nThey were the A and C-class cores that Chun Yeowun had obtained.\nThey were kept in the safe of the vice-chairman's office.\nAnd Chun Yeowun took out the S-class core from his waist bag.\nGoo!\n“Oh!”\n“Th-that…!”\nHe just took it out, but its energy made the executives drool.\n“S-class core.”\n“H-How?”\nSince they all weren’t registered Murims, they couldn’t participate in the Gate Defense openly, so they didn’t have the chance to see cores.\nAs a result, seeing 3 of them in front of them shocked them.\nLooking at their reaction, Chun Yeowun opened his mouth.\n“There are other pressing issues with you all.”\n“…”\nAt those words, the executives couldn’t raise their heads.\nChun Yeowun repeatedly criticized them for being pathetic compared to their ancestors.\nIt was the same for Chun Yu-jang.\n“Your energy is pathetic.”\nEven Hang Yu-rin, a Superior Master, had only 80% of internal energy compared to Superior Masters of the past.\nThat was due to the weak energy in the nature around them.\nAnd the Murim Association only supplied assisting devices to the ones under it.\nBesides, the Cult was at a disadvantage.\n“By refining the core, we raise the power of the Cult. Do you get it?”\n“Yes!!!”\nThe executives all responded.\nIn the present era, cores were the best way to improve their skills.\nAnd if that was given to them, then it would surely help them grow stronger.\n‘Core!’\nHappiness was apparent on all their faces.\n“I heard there is a way to refine the core. Can you secure that?”\nChun Yeowun could refine the core through Nano.\nHowever, it would be impossible to absorb the energy and then pass it to others.\nHuan Myung-oh then said.\n“I was about to say. The Cult hasn’t yet established a technology to refine the core.”\nIt was due to the restrictions.\nThe Cult wasn’t registered under the Murim Association and couldn’t participate in Gate wars.\nAs a result, there was no need for them to have cores, and getting a refining tech was difficult because of that.\n“Are you saying refining cannot be done?”\n“No. not that, we found a core refining machine when we were cleaning up the Murim branch in Jinan city.”\nHuan Myung-oh has always wanted to secure that machine.\nBut he couldn’t get his hands on it.\nHowever, when the chance came, he didn’t miss it.\n“That is good.”\nHuan Myung-oh couldn’t hide his happy face at that.\n“And where is it located?”\n“It is located in the product warehouse in the Jinan city Murim Association branch.”\n“Why didn’t you move it?”\nHuan Myung-oh answered it.\n“The device is so big that we need to disassemble it to move it. Since we couldn’t remove it carelessly, we were securing the blueprint first. It was done yesterday, and the disassembly started this morning. I will check when we’ll get it delivered.”\nHuan Myung-oh made a call.\nThe call didn’t connect despite the constant ringing.\nSensing that it was strange, Huan Myung-oh frowned and called the one in charge of security.\n“Uh?”\nHowever, that person didn’t answer either.\nJust in case, he looked to see if his phone had some problem.\nHe had instructed his guard to text him once every 30 minutes to make sure nothing went wrong.\nThe last text was received 40 minutes ago.\nBiting his lip, he said.\n“… we seem to have a problem.”\nThe Murim Association’s product warehouse in the southern part of Jinan city.\nThere, warehouses and factories of various companies were located.\nIt was possible to put their warehouses in a secret place, but the Murim Association wanted them to be in that place.\nSector 7 warehouse.\nA device that could enhance the core.\nAlthough it was a device, it weighed around 400 tons.\nAnd it took up a huge space.\nEven after disassembling, it would take a few huge trucks to move it.\nAnd such a device was being disassembled and transported.\nWheing!\nThe boxes were moved non-stop by machines.\nThere was a middle-aged man in a blue padded jumper watching it.\nThe blue scabbard around the waist showed that he was a Murim warrior.\nShh!\nA man with a black mask appeared.\n“All the corpses have been disposed of.”\n“How many minutes passed since the bodyguard sent the text?”\n“Fifteen minutes later than usual.”\n“I guess we have time here.”\nAlmost everything was loaded in boxes.\nAnd in 10 minutes, everything would be done.\n“It will take the Yongchun group at least 40 minutes to come here.”\n“Move it.”\nHearing the middle-aged man’s words, the masked man bowed.\n“With the kind of protection you gave us, we were able to start the mission with peace. To be honest, I don’t even think they will come.”\nAt those words, the middle-aged waved his hand.\n“Don’t just say stuff like that.”\n“I am serious. I just came here as the association dispatched me, but I never dreamed of being with such a great person. It is an honor.”\nThe middle-aged man smiled at those words.\nWho would even hate praises?\n“One of the Five Great Warriors, warrior Kwak, is with us. Besides, Eighteen Flame Plum troops are guarding this place, so why would I be scared even if the remnants of the Cult come?”\nShockingly, the man was Kwak Woon, one of the Five Great warriors of Mount Hua.\nOne of the five Great warriors had descended here.\nIt was only natural for the masked man to be pleased.\n“Stop with this and finish the rest of the work. Even if you don’t want to, get this work done, we don't need others to get hurt.”\nRoll!\nBefore Kwak Woon could even finish speaking, something rolled on the floor.\nThe masked man looked down.\n“Kuk!”\nIt was a man’s head.\nKwak Woon was shocked.\n“Seong-gyeom!”\nThe deceased was his disciple and a member of the Eighteen Flame Plum troops.\nIt was ridiculous.\nHe was supposed to be guarding the southern entrance of the warehouse with four others, so what is his head doing here?\n‘I didn’t even feel anything, who did this?’\nHe was one of the Five Great Warriors, and he could sense everything around him.\nAnd then he heard something else.\nRoll!\nThis time it was two heads.\n“Han-jeong! Yun-hwan!”\nTwo more of the same troops.\nThey were supposed to be guarding the eastern side of the product warehouse.\nThey had blank expressions, which meant they didn’t even see what had happened.\n“K-Kwak Woon sir! What the hell is this?”\nEven the masked man couldn’t hide his shock.\nKwak Woon opened his energy to sense his surroundings.\nAnd at that moment he felt something.\n‘This!’\nThe west side of the warehouse.\n“How dare that person!”\nKwak Woon brought out his sword and stretched out his hand to the west.\nShhh!\nThe Scarlet Plum Sword, a treasured sword of Mount Hua clan, came out and rushed to the west.\n“I don’t know who that is, but I won’t…”\nPuck!\n“Kuak!”\nSomething unbelievable happened.\nThe scarlet Plum Sword which flew stabbed the masked man in his chest.\n“K-Kwak sir!”\nThe masked man fell to the floor.\nHe believed in Kwak Woon and died by his sword.\nKwak Woon’s face was filled with anger and shock.\n‘W-who? my Air Sword?’\nHe didn’t seen see the sword fly in that direction.\nAnd then he heard footsteps.\nAs if the person didn’t need to hide his presence.\nKwak Woon slowly turned his head.\nStep!\nSomeone walked in the dark shadows of the warehouse with something in his hand.\n“Byung-chan!!!!”\nIt was the head of Bae Byung-chan, one of the members of his troops, dripping in blood.\nThe head was thrown at Kwak Woon.\nRoll!\n“You, Youuuu!”\nKwak Woon, who lost his reason at the death of his people, stretched out his hand to grab the sword.\nShhh!\nThe Scarlet Plum Sword, which was lodged in the masked man's chest, was pulled out and flew to him, but then it stopped.\nPrrr!\n“Kuk!”\nThe stretched-out hand was staggering with veins popping up.\nEven though Kwak Woon raised the energy, the sword didn’t come for him.\nChachachang!\nAnd then the sword, which stopped mid-air, shattered.\n“Pah!”\nKwak Woon coughed up blood and moved two steps back.\nDue to the enormous amount of internal energy he used, he suffered an internal injury.\nWho would have thought that one of the Five Great Warriors would be humiliated like this.\n“Kuak… you… you bastard…. Who are you!”\nKwak Woon glared at whoever was hiding in the shadows.\nJump!\nAnd someone appeared from the shadows.\nIt was Chun Yeowun with his sharp eyes.\n‘So young?’\nThis man looked to be in his twenties, which made Kwak Woon doubt his eyes.\nCun Yeowun spoke with a disappointed face.\n“It is pathetic that you were given the title of Five Great Warriors.”\n“Wh-what?”",

      "content": "Chapter 96: Core Refining Machine (2)\n‘Pa-pathetic?’\nFive Great Warriors.\nAmong the registered Murim warriors, these five people were at the very top.\nHow much did one have to work to get that honor?\n“You!”\nAngry at the insulting words, Kwak Woon swung his swords.\nThere was one secret he realized as he reached this current status.\n‘Plum Blossom Sword!’\nIt was a technique in which shattered sword pieces could be controlled.\nHowever, he had never thought that he would use it on the treasure, Scarlet Plum Sword.\nChachacha!\nThe sword’s fragments on the ground moved at once.\nIt may have seemed easy, but it was not.\nThe trajectory of the fragments of the flying blades followed the 25 Plum Blossom Sword technique.\n‘The moment you try to block the fragments, the smaller pieces will cut into you.’\nA deadly technique.\nAs a descendant of an orthodox clan, he knew how vicious this technique was.\nShhh!\nAs expected, Chun Yeowun raised his hand.\nIt seemed like he was trying to block the shards of the sword.\n“Pretty interesting attempt, but the idea is sloppy.”\n‘!?’\nSwish!\nChun Yeowun lowered his palm.\nPapapak!\nThe fragments of the blade, which were rapidly flying at him, were knocked onto the ground with internal energy.\n‘No!’\nKwak Woon’s face hardened.\nHis secret technique was blocked as if it was nothing.\n‘My… my secret…’\nKwak Woon, who was staggering with extreme shock, coughed blood again.\n“Kuak!”\nIt was because he raised his energy to control the shards, and it then unexpectedly backfired.\nKwak Woon almost fell down, but he held his stomach and glared at Chun Yeowun.\n‘Who the hell…? Why is this monster here?’\nThe Murim Association had several rules.\nThe first rule was so important that no one under the association would dare break.\nEach year, there would be five requests from the association, and they need to be fulfilled.\nBut there was an exception.\nThe higher the rank, the better the treatment.\n[Go to Jinan city to check the working of the Yongchun Group, the remnants of the Demonic Cult.]\nIt was a letter Kwak Woon had been given.\nHe asked the Murim Association executive.\n[Weren't they being monitored by the Jinan city Murim branch?]\n[I… I guess you haven’t heard yet.]\n[What?]\n[Before the latest opening of the Gate in Jinan city, 70% of the Murim warriors of the Jinan city branch who participated in the war were wiped out, and the remaining ones requested their leaves to be granted.]\n[What… why?]\nThe fact that 70% died and that the remaining ones left the branch meant that the Murim Association had no control of Jinan city anymore.\n[The head office is concerned about this. They are urgently asking you to stay at Weifang after the Gate issue is done.]\nWeifang city was to the east of Jinan.\nThe Demonic Cult.\nThe one thing the Murim Association was wary of.\nWhich was why they were monitoring the Cult for 27 years.\n[I get it. I’ll take this task.]\nKwak Woon thought of what happened and was now regretting it.\nHe had one remaining right to refuse the task. He should have used it.\nHowever, since the location was close, he accepted the job.\nShhh!\nBlood was clogging up in his throat.\n“Haaa… Haaa…”\nHis injuries seemed worse than he imagined.\nThe more he tried to use energy, the worse his condition got.\nIt was as if he was already defeated.\n‘Who the hell is he?’\nIt was clear that this young man was stronger than him.\nNo matter how much he tried, he couldn’t feel the energy from Chun Yeowun, which meant he was on another level than him.\n‘Body change?’\nThere was no other way to explain the young look.\nKwak Woon opened his mouth, while trying to endure the pain.\n“Kuak… you… are you from the Demonic Cult?”\nHe asked out of curiosity.\nIt was definite that those who interfered with their work must be related to the Yongchun group.\nChun Yeowun moved his finger.\nShhh!\n“Huk!”\nKwak Woon hurriedly moved his body.\nA sharp sense passed by his side.\nSword marks lay on the ground.\n‘He made swords which can’t be seen?’\nIt was something that every martial artist longed for.\nKwak Woon acknowledged this man.\nThis young man was someone he could never defeat.\n“Interesting. To call the Cult like that in front of me.”\nDespite saying it was interesting, the voice was cold.\nEven when he was in the past, not a single person could use the word Demonic Cult in a degrading manner, but here, in front of Chun Yeowun, this man was calling the Cult in such a way.\n‘He has to be from the Demonic Cult.’\nKwak Woon’s expression darkened.\nIt was because the concerns of the Murim Association were correct.\n‘What the hell? Was there a monster like this in the Cult beside the Black Horse and Wind Demon?’\nThe Black Horse was a nickname for Chun Woo-jin, the imprisoned Lord.\nAnd Wind Demon was the Great Guardian Marayun.\nThey were like beasts 27 years ago, until the company fell.\nAnd Chun Woo-jin was one of the Five Great Warriors of that time.\nOriginally, Kwak Woon was a normal warrior, but 20 years ago, he managed to awaken and took the empty spot.\nGrunt!\nKwak Woon grunted through his teeth.\n‘… this is bad. It doesn’t matter who I am.’\nIt was embarrassing, but he had to run away.\nIf he was gonna stay obsessed with the title, then he could be taken hostage or die right there.\n‘And if I am caught, the Association will have to make a bargain. I need to let them know that there are monsters like this in the Demonic Cult!’\nHe kept trying to justify his thought to run away.\nWithout that, Kwak Woon would die.\n‘I need to retreat. Retreat…’\nShhh!\n“What do you keep mumbling inside?”\n“Huh?”\nAll of a sudden, Chun Yeowun appeared right in front of him.\nEmbarrassed, Kwak Woon tried to move away by causing a diversion with the sword pieces.\nSlash!\nIn an instant, his arm was cut-off.\n“KUAK!”\nThe pain was beyond imagination.\nHowever, since he was a Supreme Master, he could control his body more freely. So he tried to endure the pain.\nThrob!\n‘I need to hold on.’\nBecause he knew the moment his heart would shake, he would meet his end.\nKwak Woon pulled something out of his waist with his left hand.\n‘This is the worst. To use this.’\nIt had the form of a grenade.\nM94.\nA flash bomb with twice the power of a military M82.\nAn explosive that emits millions of candelas and sounds over 200 decibels.\nIt would blind both eyes and even cause permanent damage to the ears.\n‘To use this against a Human and not Gate entities.’\nPhat!\nThe flash bomb, which was supposed to explode as soon as the pin fixed on the belt was pulled out, exploded immediately.\nAlong with light, came the sound of a dolphin screaming.\n‘kuk!’\nEven with his eyes closed, the light was still horrible.\nKwak Woon cuffed his ears to not let the sound enter his ears.\n‘It would work in 4 seconds.’\nAnd those 4 seconds were crucial.\nEven if the eyes were closed a moment later, they would be burnt.\n‘Now is the time. Injure him and run away.’\nHe knew that the flash bomb wouldn’t do any damage to the opponent.\nFeeling the crisis, he knew that the enemy would also expect this.\nHowever, even if the enemy expects it, he would have to sense the opponent without seeing nor hearing.\nPhat!\nKwak Woon immediately shut his eyes.\nIt was then.\nTak!\n“Uh?”\nHis left wrist was caught.\n‘Is this even possible?’\nOnly 2 seconds passed.\nAnd the light was bright.\nKwak Woon closed his eyes tightly and tried to shake off the hand.\nSlash!\nAt that moment, something moved through his ankle, and pain came over him.\n“Kuaaak!”\nKwa Woon screamed as the light disappeared and opened his eyes.\nHe didn’t know what happened in the 4 seconds.\nIt made no sense for a man who lost his blindness and hearing to have such a good sense.\n“Y-You?”\nKwak Woon’s face turned pale.\nChun Yeowun, who was holding his wrist, looked at him.\nFor a man who was supposed to be blind by the light, he was looking straight at Kwak Woon.\n“Why did you think I couldn’t do this?”\n“No… No way…”\nGrab!\n“Eup!”\nChun Yeowun slammed his face into the floor.\nBang!\n“Kuak!”\nTaptaptap!\nAnd then sealed his blood points.\nDespite being a Supreme Master warrior, he felt defeated for real.\n‘Body isn’t moving.’\nKwak Woon was desperate.\nHis plan to run away had failed miserably.\nChun Yeowun lifted his hand, which pushed him to the ground.\n“Kay. Now I want to hear what you people were trying to do.”\nAs expected, information.\nKwak Yoon bit his lip strong enough for it to bleed.\nHe couldn’t answer.\nAfter being caught, it was obvious that the enemy would kill him once he got the information.\nShaking in anger, Kwak Woon opened his mouth.\n“Kill me.”\nHe wanted to protect the honor he had left.\nAfter all, he lost because he wasn’t skilled.\nHowever, he was never going to betray the people by leaking information.\nIn pain, he tried to speak.\n“No matter how much you torture. I will not give you anything, not to you the evil Demonic Cult!”\n“That so?”\nChun Yeowun smiled.\n‘What?’\nKwak Woon smiled.\nEven though he showed such will, the enemy was relaxed.\n‘Doesn’t matter. I will endure.’\nEven if a sword would be put on his neck, he was going to stay silent.\nBut it felt strange.\nHe thought that the enemy would pull out his nails and then cut his fingers, but Chun Yeowun kept asking questions.\n“Is the Murim Association the one who sent you?”\n“Where did you come from?”\n“What instructions did you receive?”\n“What do you know about the Murim Association?”\nAfter each question, he waited for 10 seconds and then asked another.\nKwak Woon couldn’t understand what the man’s intentions were.\nHe kept asking questions despite not getting any answer. Why was he doing that?\nKwak Woon stayed silent.\nHe wasn’t sure what mind game was being played, but he wasn’t going to fall for it.\nIt lasted for around 10 minutes.\n“That is all.”\n“…?”\nChun Yeowun stopped asking questions.\nKwak Woon’s face turned tense as the questions stopped.\nCreepy!\nHe felt something cold and gloomy.\nHe was unable to move his body, but the weird energy was very unpleasant and he wanted to run.\n‘What? What is this gloomy energy?’\nAt that moment, Kwak Woon’s eyes widened.\nShh!\nSomething hazy was moving around.\nLike a ghost.\n“Wh-what is this?”\nEven when he closed his eyes and then opened them again, the ghost stayed.\nIt was approaching them while passing through the warehouse wall, and the sight made him want to run.\nAnd it wasn’t just one ghost.\nShhh!\nThey appeared from all sides.\nConfused, he shouted at Chun Yeowun.\n“Y-you can’t see those things around?’\nHe was trying to see if he was the only one who could see them.\nChun Yeowun smiled.\n“Do I look like I don’t see them?”\nShhh!\nThe ghosts were approaching them.\nKwak Woon, who was unable to move because of the sealed blood points, yelled.\n“Are you not going to do anything?”\nDespite that, Chun Yeowun stood still.\nSoon, the ghosts were near them.\nKwak Woon’s eyes met with Chun Yeowun.\nHe then looked at the ghost.\n‘Seong-gyeom?’\nHe wasn’t sure, but the face of the ghost was similar to his disciple.\nAnd the others too.\n‘These… these are…’\nKwak Woon’s eyes turned red.\n‘Did they appear because they couldn’t forget their grudges?’\nKwak Woon believed that the ghosts appeared because of their grudge against Chun Yeowun, who killed them.\nHe felt ashamed for trembling in front of them.\n‘You are the true heroes of the faction…’\nAt that time, Chun Yeowun spoke to the ghosts.\n“Have you dealt with all the rats around you?”\n‘!?’\nKwak Woon couldn’t understand why the ghosts were nodding their heads at Chun Yeowun’s question.\n“W-what is this?”\n“Ah, were they people you brought?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s question, Kwak Woon shouted.\n“Yes you bastard! They are the proud disciples of the Mount Hua clan! They will kill…”\nGrab!\n“Eup!”\nChun Yeowun grabbed his mouth.\nAnd then said.\n“Noisy. Whatever they are, I will make sure to use them even if they are disciples.”\n‘What?’\nKwak Woon’s eyes went wide at those words.\nUnless he misunderstood, Chun Yeowun said he was the one who turned them like this.\n“Eup! Euppppp!”\n‘What did he do?’\nKwak Woon tried to protest.\nBut with his mouth closed, it sounded like a groan.\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun’s right wrist shone with a gloomy blue light.\nCreepy!\nAnd the feeling from it was the same as the energy around the ghosts.\n‘C-could this be possible?’\nPuck!\nChun Yeowun’s hand pierced his chest.\n“Kuak!”\nDrop!\nThe whole body turned pale and fell.\nIt then soon began to convulse and then stiffened.\nIt was a truly tragic death for one of the Five Great Warriors, said to be the strongest in Murim.\nShhh!\nBefore long, a ghost appeared from Kwak Woon’s body.\nChun Yeowun nodded with a smile as he looked at the ghost.\n“I must be lucky. A ghost of a Supreme Master.”\nHe was satisfied.\nReaching out his hand to the ghost’s head, Chun Yeowun mumbled.\n“Let’s see what you thought about those questions.”\nThe ability to read memories.\nFinally, he got a chance to use it.",

      "content": "Chapter 97: The Murim Association (1)\n‘I guess they aren’t that stupid.’\nChun Yeowun, who read the memories of Kwak Woon’s ghost, thought so.\nNo matter how much information was blocked and covered with the pretext of the Gate wars, the Murim Association’s suspicions were directed towards the Sky Demon order.\n‘This is proof that they are afraid of the Cult.’\nThe proof was that the Murim Association could do nothing other than hold back even though 27 years had passed\nHowever, that wasn’t all. The Murim Association’s response was quite extraordinary.\nAccording to Kwak Woon’s memories, the Murim Association sent him because he was close to Jinan city.\n‘They didn’t hold onto their power.’\nEven among the association’s warriors, the Five Great Warriors were the best.\nIn the case of Kwak Woon, he was from the Mount Hua clan.\nOf course, this action was taken by the association since they thought that such a skilled person would be able to solve the suspicions they had in the Jinan city.\n‘Hmm.’\nUnderstanding the entire situation from the memories alone was difficult.\nKwak Woon didn’t directly give the full answers, but he did unconsciously recall a few things.\nAnd those fragments were being seen by Chun Yeowun.\nIt was more like a movie, but unclean editing.\n‘Well, it wasn’t like there was no benefit from this.’\nHe got some pretty useful ghosts, and learned about some of their weaknesses too.\nThe number of Ghosts around Chun Yeowun was 14, including Kwak Woon.\nFive out of the Mount Hua clan disciples couldn’t be turned into Ghosts.\n‘Some kind of self-defense which prevented the Ghosts from forming.’\nAmong the 18 disciples, some witnessed the death of their comrades and responded accordingly, so the surprise attack didn’t work.\nAnd as they died, Ghosts didn’t form from their bodies.\nSo the ghost wouldn’t be formed if the man’s body was being protected by self-defense techniques.\n‘That was unfortunate.’\nIf this weakness spread to others, then they would use that to prevent more Ghosts from forming.\n‘Well, the secret should just not leak out.’\nSince he was aware of this, he blocked the blood points of Kwak Woon in advance.\n“Come in.”\nWhen Chun Yeowun raised his right arm, the Ghosts roaming around began to get absorbed into the wrist guard.\nShhh!\nAny power could be used appropriately. Chun Yeowun came out of the warehouse and approached the large RV parked in front.\nLooking at the license plate, it was clear that this car was a rental.\nShh! Click!\nChun Yeowun reached out and broke the window.\nA study case bag inside.\nThe case seemed to be made of special alloy and locked with a fingerprint.\nHowever, that meant nothing to Chun Yeowun.\nBeep!\nNano hacked through it, and the case was opened. It revealed a fist-sized sphere emitting dazzling light.\nA core.\n[Estimated to be an A-class core.]\n‘Right.’\nIf one looked at the vast energy radiating from it, it was sure to be an A-class core.\nSatisfied, Chun Yeowun closed the case.\nThis must’ve been the core that Kwak Woon had acquired in the Gate at Weifang city.\n‘I must be lucky.’\nCoincidentally, right after acquiring the core, he was asked to take up this job in Jinan city.\nDue to that, the man could not absorb the core and brought it along, only to die and let Chun Yeowun take it.\nAt the dying moments, the man had intensely thought of this.\n‘Two A-class and one S-class core…’\nChun Yeowun was anxious as he didn’t have many cores with him, but he managed to have three cores of top quality.\nAnd this would be enough to increase the power even more.\n“Now that we have recovered the important thing, should I recover the others too?”\nChun Yeowun closed the case and walked around the entrance of the product warehouse looking for the dead masked people and the corpses of the Mount Hua disciples.\nMeanwhile, some people of the Yongchun group had arrived.\n“Ah…”\nHuan Myung-oh couldn’t hide his shock.\nFortunately, the situation was sorted out by Chun Yeowun, but he hated himself for not being able to get the information that the Murim Association had come here.\n“I am sorry. I should have known this.”\nIt was hard to say that this was Huan Myung-oh’s mistake.\nBecause of the underground high-speed trains, which were managed by the Defense, it was unreasonable to know who was using them in real time.\nAnd as the trains were the most important means of transportation, it was impossible to plant people because the Defense would thoroughly check for suspicious people.\nHuan Myung-oh tried to plant people with fake human skin masks, but it always failed as fingerprint and iris verification were needed.\n“I’ll try to figure out a way to identify the people coming into Jinan.”\nChun Yeowun threw something at Huan Myung-oh.\n“Use this.”\nTak!\n“This is?”\nA ring.\nIt looked like an ordinary ring, why would he be given a ring?\n“The one called Kwak Woon had it.”\n“Huh! Kwak Woon? The Mount Hua clan’s Kwak Woon?”\nHuan Myung-oh was shocked at those words.\nEven though he wasn’t a member of the Murim Association, Huan Myung-oh knew the things happening in the Murim world.\nAnd Kwak Woon was one of the Five Great Warriors.\nHe didn’t even imagine that one of the strongest in the association would break into the warehouse.\n“Director Huan! Look at this body!”\nAt the same time, the cultists who were incinerating the bodies around the product warehouse brought a body out on a stretcher.\nThe body belonged to Kwak Woon.\nWhite face and a ghastly body.\nBut the man was easily recognizable.\n‘For the swordsman of Mount Hua to turn into this.’\nHe knew about Chun Yeowun’s power.\nAnd for Chun Yeowun, even the Five Great Warriors seemed to be just rats.\n‘Are they sending the strongest ones? That means that the Murim Association has noticed us.’\nHuan Myung-oh's face darkened at that.\nWhen they went against the Jinan city’s Murim branch, they did expect this to some extent.\nBut he didn’t think that such strong people would be sent.\nThis meant that they were being vigilant.\n‘If Lord Chun Ma hadn’t come here first, then the device would have been taken away and we would have suffered terribly.’\nChun Yeowun could easily handle Kwak Woon.\nHowever, the reputation of the Mount Hua clan’s Kwak Woon was huge.\nAnd if it was the Yongchun group that fought with him, then they would have lost.\nThe Murim Association would have also received the information that the Cult was trying to rise again.\nHuan Myung-oh opened his mouth with a serious look.\n“My Lord, the Murim Association…”\n“Must have noticed us. They would be idiots if they didn’t.”\n“I see why Lord has ordered for the merging to be done right away.”\nIf the Murim Association was being this wary, it was obvious that they would think of other ways to attack the Cult.\nThe longer it took for the merger to happen, the more chances Murim Association would have to sway others.\nIn the end, the merger had to be hastened like Chun Yeowun said.\n“Lord Chun Ma, what about this?”\nHuan Myung-oh asked about the ring he was given.\nA personal belonging of Kwak Woon, but he didn’t know the reason Chun Yeowun gave it to him.\n“There is a chip in the ring.”\n“Huh? Inside?”\nThe ring was small and thin.\nWhich meant that a micro-scale chip could be planted in it.\n“It has to be the Murim Association. You brought your phone?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, Huan Myung-oh handed the smartphone around his wrist.\nAs Chun Yeowun grabbed the phone, a nanowire jumped out of Chun Yeowun’s palm and connected with it.\nIt then sent information to the screen.\nAfter finishing, Chun Yeowun handed the phone back to him and said.\n“I put the code of the frequency of the chip in the ring.”\n“L-Lord, code of the frequency?”\nHuan Myung-oh couldn’t hold back his expression as the task was done in such a short time.\nHe looked at his phone. Since not even the fingerprint was unlocked, he couldn’t understand.\nTo him, Chun Yeowun said.\n“Can you use that to make a tracking device?”\n“P-possible.”\nBuilding a tracking device could be possible if the frequency code was known.\nAnd with that, it would be possible to find out the owner of this chip.\nThough it couldn’t be used inside the underground trains, just putting the members of the Cult with the tracking device on the platform would be enough to detect people.\n‘We can stop them as soon as they enter Jinan city!’\nSuddenly, Huan Myung-oh thought that it wouldn’t be just Kwak Woon, but the other warriors of the Murim Association would have this too.\n‘Then the others will…’\n“No need to check. Put your hand out.”\nHuan Myung-oh stretched his hand out at Chun Yeowun’s words.\nA handful of things were grabbed from the pocket of Chun Yeowun’s coat and placed in his hand.\nIt started with buttons and all.\n“Y-You found all these?”\nHuan Myung-oh was shocked.\nWithout proper equipment, he was worried about how to find these chips.\nBut the surprise didn’t end there.\n“Take this as well. This is what Kwak Woon had.”\n“Kwak Woon?”\nHuan Myung-oh was puzzled by the case that Chun Yeowun handed him.\nIt had fingerprint recognition, but it wasn’t locked, so he opened it.\n“Oh!”\nA core was inside the case.\nHuan Myung-oh was at a loss of words at the core which was emitting tremendous energy.\n‘Just when…’\nIt seemed like Chun Yeowun possessed a number of abilities that didn’t go in line with a martial artist.\nAnd it was so amazing to see them all in action.\n‘They are all unlucky ones.’\nThey tried to take away the core refinement device and dig up information about the Cult. However, they didn’t just lose their strong warrior, but also a precious A-class core.\nThey were going to get pissed now.\nAnd just the thought made Huan Myung-oh feel refreshed.\nUp Until now, they were all in a position where they were bowing down to the Murim Association. But seeing how the Murim Association was now getting beat, he felt excited.\nAnd then came one concern.\n‘Ah… this one, will make them certain.’\nCome to think of it, till now, the association was in a state of doubt.\nHowever, if the recapturing of the device failed and the fact that Kwak Woon died was known, then their doubt would turn into certainty.\n“… Lord Chun Ma. it seems like their movement will be in full swing after this.”\n“In what way?”\n“Maybe they will try to pressure us saying that Kwak Woon disappeared or maybe… they will come for an all-out war with us before we even get the numbers on our side.”\nIf the association dispatched one of the Five Great Warriors because of a doubt, then they’d surely wage a full-out war if they were sure.\nIf that happened, the merger wouldn’t be the most important task, since it would be crucial to come up with a way to handle the Murim Association.\n“That won’t happen.”\n“Sorry?”\nPuzzled at Chun Yeowun’s, Huan Myung-oh asked.\n“How could you get to that conclusion?”\n“Huan Myung-oh. What do you think is the best defense?”\nIt seemed like Chun Yeowun was asking about the invasion preparation of the association.\nChun Yeowun spoke in a calm voice to Huan Myung-oh as he was nervous and couldn’t come up with an answer.\n“It is a preemptive strike.”\n‘!?’\nThree days later.\nWuhan city.\nLocated in the middle of Hubei province, this city was known to be the safest city.\nThe reason was that the head office of the Murim Association was located here.\nThe home of the modern martial arts with hundreds of small and medium clans taking root here.\nMore than 30,000 of the residents were martial artists.\nThe headquarters of the Murim Association was to the northeast of Wuhan.\nThe main office building was in the form of a tiled house modeled after the old Murim structure.\nIn addition, there were more than 20 buildings and hundreds of exercise facilities on the vast site.\n“Haa! Haa!”\nThe cheers of Murim people filled the hall throughout the site.\nAnd a large cargo truck had entered the Murim Association.\nKik!\nThe barricade went down and blocked the entrance.\nThe guards at the entrance of the main gate came out and stopped the cargo truck.\nA security guard wearing a yellow band, who seemed to be the team leader, gestured for the window to be rolled down.\nWheing!\nThe truck’s window rolled down and showed the driver's face.\nBut the driver seemed nervous.\nPuzzled, the security guard asked.\n“Your vehicle isn’t registered, so what business do you have here?”\n“T-that…”\nAt the question, the driver looked at the person sitting next to him.\nSince the cargo truck was large, the passenger seat wasn’t visible from outside.\nHowever, the truck driver suddenly looked confused.\n“Huh? If you say that…”\nThe head of the security guard thought this was strange and took out the pistol.\n“What are you up to? Show me your identity card right now.”\nWaving his hands in fear, the driver said.\n“I-I have nothing to do with this…”\nClick!\nThe guard aimed the pistol at the driver.\n“Declare what business you have here! Otherwise!”\n“Eik!”\nSwish!\nWhen the leader gestured, the other guards pulled out their pistols and surrounded the truck.\nThey were ready to check the truck at any moment.\n“This is the last warning. What business…”\nIt was then.\nThe voice of the one next to the truck driver came out.\n“Business? I have come to wipe out the entire main office of the Murim Association.”",

      "content": "Chapter 98: The Murim Association (2)\n“W-what?”\nThe leader of the security team couldn’t believe his ears.\nHe wasn’t the best when it came to martial arts, but how could one utter such absurd remarks at the entrance of the Murim Association?\n“Crazy bastard! Seize them and search the truck right now.”\nExcept for the 5 guards aiming their pistols at the front window and the driver seats, the other 8 people approached the back door of the loaded cargo truck.\n-Click!\nA guard shouted at the driver.\n“Put your hands above your head, or I will shoot you!”\n“Eeik!”\nThe driver immediately raised his hands.\nIt looked like the guards were really ready to shoot him, so he followed their instructions.\nAs for the luggage.\n“Open it!”\n“Yes!”\nWhile the rest of the guards were aiming at him, the other guards at the back pressed the UP button at the back door, and the shutter entrance opened.\nWheing!\nThe shutter went up, revealing the huge cargo inside.\nAs there was no light, the entire space looked dark, but there seemed to be countless eyes lurking within it.\n‘!?’\nThe guards’ faces hardened.\nOne of the guards was startled and tried to shout.\n“T-team leade…”\nPuck!\n“Kuak!”\nSomeone jumped out of the dark cargo and stabbed the guy in the head.\nFlustered, the others opened fire.\nBababababang!\nClang! Clang!\n“N-no way!”\nThose in the cargo compartment cut down the bullets with their swords.\nIt was so fast that the guards couldn’t even see what had happened.\n“Uh, this sword is pretty good,”\nThe one who blocked the bullet was Hu Bong.\nSatisfied with the sword made from titanium alloy, he cut the guards with light movements.\nClash! Slash!\n“Kuak!”\nIn a second or two, Hu Bong knocked them all down.\nThe guards were all warriors too, but compared to Hu Bong, a Supreme Master level, they were like little kids.\n“W-what is happening?”\nThe leader of the team, who kept aiming at the driver, looked back at the cargo in shock.\nThe floor below was in blood.\nAll the guards who were standing there had now fallen to the ground.\n“Damn it!”\nThe leader, realizing that the worst had happened, tried to press the radio button on his chest.\nIt was a button that would sound the emergency alarm throughout the site.\nAt that moment, his head suddenly turned to the side.\nCrack!\n“Kuck!”\nHe was a leader, a gatekeeper for the Murim Association, but in an instant, he lost his life.\nAnd he wasn’t the only one.\nThud! Thud! Thud!\n5 other guards who were aiming their pistols at the driver died in the same way.\nThe driver, who witnessed the scene, turned white not knowing what to do.\n“T-they are dead!”\nThe person next to him just made a single motion, and all of them just died.\nThe driver, who was an ordinary civilian, considered the man to be the God of Death.\n“The driver can get off.”\n“Thank you for sparing me!”\nSince he was spared, the driver was about to get out, when the person sitting in the middle handed him something.\n“Here.”\n“This will be enough compensation.”\nIt was a single gold card.\nThis card, which wasn’t registered by a user, could act like a check.\nIf this was taken to the bank and one asked to transfer the contents into their account, the amount would be transferred.\n“You can buy three trucks like this.”\n“Th-thank you!”\nThe driver’s expression brightened.\nThe driver was already paid a huge amount for this transportation.\nNodding, he took the card and looked at it a couple of times before running away.\nWhen he disappeared, the one in the middle seat moved to the driver’s seat.\n“Lord. Where to now?”\nIt was Bi Mak-heon.\nWhen the driver was there, he tried to be calm, but he was actually nervous.\nOnce they would pass through the main gate, they would enter the head office of the Murim Association.\n‘Is this really a safe plan?’\nHe trusted Chun Yeowun so he followed him here.\nBut this place was the centre of the enemy camp!\nThe site was filled with thousands of enemies, and the entire Wuhan city had tens of thousands of warriors.\nChun Yeowun, who was in the passenger seat, opened his mouth while looking at the text hanging on the gate.\n“Ban on firearms… is that like a weapon ban?”\n[Ban on firearms]\nThose who wanted to enter the head office of the Murim Association weren’t allowed to carry firearms.\nAll the firearms had to be handed to the security office.\nThere was a thing called Weapons Ban in the past.\nThose who visited a clan territory would have to keep away their weapons to show that they didn’t hold hostility.\n“We don’t have guns so we can enter. Step on it Mak-heon.”\n“Yes!”\nHe stepped on the accelerator right away.\nChun Yeowun reached out his hand and the barricade shattered, opening the way.\nRumble!\nThe truck passed through.\nAnd as if there was nothing stopping it, the truck went ahead.\nMeanwhile, in the control room of the Murim Association.\nA place where the CCTVs were all being checked.\nA monitoring agent shouted.\n“A-a cargo truck broke through the entrance.”\n“What?”\nAt those words, the head of the control room looked at the gate.\nIn the video, the gate was mashed, and the cargo truck sprinted ahead.\n“What the hell are the security guards doing… shit!”\nThe head of the control room, who saw the CCTV video, shuddered at the sight.\nAll the guards were dead.\n“Sound the emergency alarm! Now!”\n“Yes!”\nAn agent pressed the emergency button right away.\nWheeeing! Wheeeing! Wheeeing!\nAn emergency alarm resounded throughout the head office.\nEach CCTV screen showed a number of warriors running out of the buildings.\nHundreds of them came to the building entrance.\n“Crazy bastards! How dare they bring down a cargo truck into the head office of the Murim Association.”\nThe head of the control room clicked his tongue.\nThere were around 4 thousand people on the site.\nAnd all were warriors.\nEven if it was the National Guards, they would have to be defeated if they fought against these warriors.\n“They will die.”\nThere were five armed groups in the Murim Association.\nThe first was the Association Defense Force, with the role to prevent enemies from invading the Murim Association.\n“Lee Chan-oh, 2nd commander.”\nIn the CCTVs, about 300 people were holding spears in front of a truck which was sprinting ahead.\nIt was the Spear troops led by Lee Chan-oh, the Spear King.\nOne of three armed forces of the association.\n“Spear troops! Get the spears ready!”\n“Spears ready!!!”\nAt Lee Chan-oh’s cry, the members of the Spear troops took a stance at once.\nA white light flashed on their spears.\nAll of them had reached the Master level and were able to create spear energy.\nWheing!\nBesides, the other groups rushed in from both directions to the spot where the cargo truck was coming.\nThe three hundred people from the west were brute force troops, and the three hundred from the east were swordsmen.\nThe warriors, who were close to a thousand, were all elite troops.\n“Lord Chun Ma.”\nThe face of Bi Mak-heon, who was holding the steering wheel, went stiff at the sight.\nThe three leaders of the troops were all Superior Masters and had a huge reputation in the modern Murim.\n“Keep going. Until the building there.”\nWhere Chun Yeowun pointed was the tile-roofed building.\nIt was the main office.\n‘Are we going to be fine?’\nBo Mak-heon was worried.\nThese people weren't the police or the National Guard.\nEven if they were in Master level, with their numbers, they could cut down the truck in half.\n“Stop the truck right now!!!”\nLee Chan-oh, the leader of the Spear troops, shouted when the distance was around 300 meters.\nDespite driving, Bi Mak-heon could hear the voice.\n“They are stupid.”\nAnd then gave the orders to the Spear troops in a second.\n“Spears! Get them ready!”\n“Yes!”\nThe warriors threw the spears loaded with spear energy at the cargo truck.\nSwoosh!\nMore than a hundred spears came for the cargo truck.\n“L-Lord Chun Ma!”\nBi Mak-heon called for him.\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun stretched out his hand towards the front.\nPapapak!\nThree hundred flying spears stopped.\n“W-what?!”\n“The spears stopped?”\nAt that sight, Lee Chan-oh and the others were shocked.\nAnd that wasn’t it.\n“Should give you back.”\nWhen Chun Yeowun gestured, the spears turned back and flew back to their owners.\nSwosh!\n“Ugh! Shied!”\nAt Lee Chan-oh’s urgent cry, the spear users pulled their special alloy shields which were on their backs.\nAs if trained beforehand, they made a single line shield with it.\nThe only problem was that the spears weren’t regular spears.\nPapapak!\nAs they had spear energy on it, they passed through the shields.\n“Kuak!”\nWhoops!\nIn an instant, 100 warriors who were in the front row fell down.\nIf it wasn’t for the special alloy shield, then those in the second and third rows would have been penetrated.\nCrack!\n“Such monsters exist?”\nLee Chan-oh grunted.\nHe must not let this truck reach the main office.\n“Spear holders! Follow me!”\nSwosh!\nLee Chan-oh stood at the front ready to attack.\nThe surviving people in the spear troops followed.\nIt wasn’t just them.\n“Swordsmen follow me!”\n“Fist troops! Follow me!”\nSwordsmen troops leader Ma Hyeon-joong and the leader of Fist troops Lee Cheong-un went ahead with their men.\n“Wahhh!!!”\nTheir screams reached the truck.\n‘Oh my gosh…’\nBi Mak-heon frowned.\nTo get so much manpower.\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun said.\n“Hu Bong. Mun Ran-yeong.”\nClench!\nAs if waiting to hear the call, the roof on the truck was pierced, and two people jumped out.\nChun Yeowun ordered them.\n“Teach those cheeky youngsters the power of the Sky Demon Order.”\n“We will teach them my Lord!”\nHu Bong and Mun Ran-yeong responded with power and extended their swords ahead.\nWheik!\nFlames fluttered from the sword in Hu Bong’s hands.\nDrawing a huge trajectory, it flew to the swordsmen.\n“W-what is this?”\n“Flame?”\nPapapak!\nDozens of warriors, who were trying to move close, were swept away by the sudden flames.\n“Kuak!”\n“H-hot!”\nSimilarly, from the outstretched hand of Mun Ran-yeong, a huge fan-shaped flame covered the fist troops.\nWheik!\nIn an instant, the warriors of the fist troops were crushed by the flames and fell down.\n“Ughh!”\n“W-what is this?”\nThe flame wasn’t just hot.\nThe flame had energy in it, and it exceeded the level the Association’s Defense Forces could stop.\n“Kuck!”\n“Damned bastards!”\nTak!\nThe two leaders who managed to survive, got close to the truck.\n“Oh! Come on.”\nChachachacha!\n“Wh-what kind of swordsman…kuak!”\nHu Bong’s brilliant swordsmanship fell on the body of Ma Hyeon-joong, who couldn’t handle it and then fell down.\nIt was no different for Lee Cheong-un, who got on the truck.\n“What is this damn bitch using!”\n“Bitch? Don’t make me laugh. Try beating this bitch if you can.”\nPapak!\n“Kuak!”\nWithout much effort, Mun Ran-yeong’s attacks made him bleed.\nAs the technique of the Dragon Fist clan pierced into his internal organs, veins bulged out and then he coughed up blood.\nPapak!\nHaving defeated the leaders of the two troops, the married couple walked ahead.\nThe warriors of the Spear troops who arrived a little late, were running at the truck.\n“Honey, should we go together?”\nAt Hu Bong’s question, Mun Ran-yeong smiled and nodded her head.\nAnd then they both stretched out their hands at the same time.\nWheik!\nHundreds of spheres of flame floated in the air.\nThe sphere of flames surrounding the truck were spectacular.\n‘!!!’\nLee Chan-oh felt terrified.\nSwoosh!\nThe spheres of flame flew towards them like cannons.\nLee Chan-oh cried out.\n“Everyone! Avoid!”\nPapak!\nDespite being warriors who had to be ready to die, the spear troops immediately spread out.\nStruggling to live.\n“Euk!”\n“Ackkk!”\nBut there were those who couldn’t avoid getting hit.\nThose struck by the flame burned up right away.\n“Damn it! Do you think that I’ll be defeated so easily!”\nChachacha!\nThe Superior master level, Lee Chan-oh, hastily blocked the flame with a spear and evaded it.\nBang!\n“Kiak!”\nBut The speeding truck hit him.\nBi Mak-heon, who was holding the steering wheel, frowned as the wheel shuddered a little.\n“Hu…”\nMeanwhile, those monitoring the CCTV in the control room were stunned.\nOne of the five armed groups of the Murim Association that had to stop the truck.\nWas wiped away.\nThe red-haired man and woman on the truck were monsters.\n“They, what are they?”\nThe truck was already getting close to the main office.",

      "content": "Chapter 99: The Murim Association (3)\nBeep! Beep!\nThe intercom in the control room.\nThe head, who was staring at the CCTV, was startled at the number of people who were simultaneously calling in.\n“Yes. I am the head of the control room.”\n-What are you doing right now?\nA thick voice filled with displeasure came through the receiver.\nThey weren’t even face-to-face, but the man seemed very upset so the head was standing stiff.\n“I-I apologize!”\n-Apologize…. How far do you plan on letting the cargo truck go?\nThe head was restless at the words he heard.\n‘He was watching too.’\nThere was no way the man on the line couldn’t see it.\nThe most number of intercoms existed in the highest place of the Murim Association head office.\nThe cargo truck was moving fast.\nThe goal was, of course, the main office of the head office.\n“Dir-director. They don’t seem to be ordinary warriors. They can freely use Flame qi…”\n-Activate the EV fields.\n“Huh?”\nEV field.\nA device that scatters the energy around.\nSince the disbandment of the MS group 15 years ago, all the technical equipment related to them had been completely taken away and banned by the State.\nNumerous wires were deeply buried in the ground, and they were left untouched to avoid tearing down an entire site to retrieve them.\nOf course, that was the reason why the Murim Association was placed in such a place, but not many knew the reason behind it.\n“Director General, the use of EV fields has been officially banned. Unless a majority of the council agree…”\n-What do you think we are doing right now!?\n‘Ah!’\nCurrently, the council meeting is being held in the conference room. So rules could be made at any time.\nThen there would be no particular problem using the field.\nExcept for one thing.\n“But, if we use the EV field, it will also affect our allies.”\nThe worst downside of the EV field.\nIt would make it impossible for anyone in that area to use their energy.\nBecause it scatters all the energy around.\n-In that case, won’t we have an advantage with numbers? Wouldn’t they have less advantage?\nAt those words, the head of the security room went silent.\nObviously, as he said, surely the energy in the bodies wouldn’t be harnessed anymore, and it would be difficult to handle the opponents.\n‘But.’\nThe man knew.\nEven if that was done, they had thousands of warriors there.\n“I’ll do as instructed.”\nClick!\nWith that, the intercom was cut.\nAt the same time, in the conference room on the 30th floor of the Murim Association office.\nA tall, blue-eyed middle-aged man in a navy blue suit, with the disconnected intercom, turned his head and looked at the conference table.\nWheing!\nA hologram device was spinning.\nMost of those who attended the conference hall were present as holograms.\nIn fact, there were just six people who attended this meeting.\nA middle-aged man with a sad-looking face, in the second seat, asked.\n-If the problem is serious, you can postpone this meeting. Director Kwon.\n“Not at all. What could be more important than the Demonic Cult forming again? We will continue with the meeting right now.”\n“I know.”\nWhen director Kwon took his seat, a tall man in his late thirties, sitting at the top of the table with a blue suit, started the meeting.\nOn the nameplate, was written, Mun Jeong-so, the acting chairman of Murim Association.\nHe was a disciple of the chairman of Murim Association and the director of the Ohshin Group.\nBrrng!\nA speeding cargo truck crossing the site of the Murim Association.\nBI Mak-heon, who was holding the steering week, was on alert.\nOn the way to the office, there were a huge number of warriors that couldn’t even be counted with the naked eye.\n‘My mouth has gone dry.’\nAnd there were some strong ones.\nIt seemed like they were surrounding them to not let them go to the office.\nThe reason they couldn’t attack them was because of the numerous flame spheres around the truck.\nWheik!\nSome warriors tried to get close to the truck, but each time, Mun Ran-yeong or Hu Bong would guard the truck with flames.\nNevertheless, they continued to move, and at some point, more warriors gathered in front of the office building.\n‘What is their plan?’\nIt was the moment they were puzzled.\nShst!\nAt the same time, the flame spheres spinning around the truck disappeared.\nIt wasn’t because Hu Bong or Mun Ran-yeong wanted to.\n‘This is?’\nChun Yeowun narrowed his eyes.\nThe energy of nature around him was rapidly dissipating.\nAll around them.\n‘Is it like that time?’\nChun Yeowun had been through this once.\nThe EV field he experienced in the Research Centre run by the MS Group.\n“Uh?”\n“Bong Bong. The energy is scattered.”\nThe two people on the truck were shocked at what they were experiencing for the first time.\nHu Bong raised his sword and tried to induce energy into it, but soon, the sword was back to normal.\n“This is bad.”\nNot being able to channel the energy meant that they couldn’t do wide-ranged attacks anymore.\n“Done! We did it!”\n“Woahhh!!!!”\nThe warriors screamed.\nThey had been gathered in front of the office because they were informed that an EV field would be activated.\nEven if the opponents were amazing warriors, if they couldn’t make their swords fly or cast techniques, the battle would be close-ranged.\nNumbers would definitely win.\n“Fight!”\nPhat! Phat!\nAs if waiting for it to happen, at the shout of the leaders, the warriors moved for the truck.\nWhen he saw people rushing in to fight the war.\n“M-My Lord. What do we do now?”\nBi Mak-heon was terrified.\nAt this rate, it wouldn’t be weird if they abandon the truck and move out.\nThose who used footwork were Super masters, and they were gradually closing the distance.\n“Huh. I guess they aren’t all idiots.”\n“Huh?”\nChun Yeowun had lost interest as he didn’t like how the Murim Association responded to their intrusion.\nThis was supposed to be the Murim association\nThe first counterattack was horrible and didn’t meet his expectations.\n“Shakena!”\n“Yes! Master!”\nShhh!\nShakena passed through the driver’s seat.\n“Shit!”\nDespite knowing her abilities, Bi Mak-heon was startled by her sudden appearance.\n“Woah! A swarm of humans! They look so delicious.”\nShakena wiggled her tongue.\nInstead of looking at them as enemies, she looked at them as prey.\n“Use Phasing.”\n“Yes!”\nWith a hum, she placed her hands on the truck's centre.\nAt that moment, a purple energy emanated from her dyed hands and gradually turned the truck transparent.\nWoong!\n“What was that?”\n“The truck is turning transparent!”\nThe warriors rushing towards it were confused by the strange phenomenon.\nThe leaders urged the warriors to not stop.\n“Don’t concern yourself with that!”\n“That’s just a gimmick! Move!”\nAt their leaders’ request, the Murims shouted and rushed again.\n“Hap!”\nWoong!\nThe leader of the vanguard troops tried to cut the truck in half with the huge sword.\nAnd then came the amazing thing.\nShhh!\n“Uh?”\nThe sword just went through the truck.\nIt just passed through.\nThe truck didn’t stop and moved forward.\nVroom!\n“Ugh!”\nFlustered, the man tried to stop the truck with his sword, but the truck passed through him again.\nAnd the same happened with other warriors too.\nShhh!\n“W-what the hell is this?”\n“Truck!”\nThe warriors on the front swung their swords to smash the truck, but it passed through their bodies.\n“They!”\nShhh!\nAs the truck passed through them, everyone was shocked and stood still.\n“Stop it! We need to stop it!”\n“How can we even stop this?”\nThere was no point in attacking the truck when it could pass through everything.\nThe truck kept passing as if the 3,000 warriors ahead didn’t even exist.\nAnd then reached the front of the Murim Association office, which they were desperately trying to defend.\n“Such a stupid thi…”\n“The intruders passed us.”\nThe warriors were stunned as they saw the truck right ahead of the office building.\nFor the first time in the history of the Murim Association, the enemy reached the office.\nAnd that while passing through all the defensive power.\nWheeing!\nWhen the truck stopped, The door of its cargo compartment went up and around fifty people in black shirts and red letters came down.\nThe elite people, all above Super Master level.\n“No. those clothes…”\n“Demonic Cult!”\nThe clothes were the traditional attire of the Demonic Cult.\nThe warriors of the association who recognized that couldn’t hide their shock.\nThey all wondered what kind of enemies would do such a crazy thing. Who could have imagined that it would be the Demonic Cult?\nGrunt!\n“How dare the remnants of the Demonic Cult raid the head office of the Murim Association! The center of the Murim!”\nThe leader of the Vanguard troops, Kam Cheok, grunted his teeth.\nHe was furious from the moment these intruders broke through and now when they were in front of the main office too.\nTak!\n“Senior Kam.”\nNext to him, Hang-ryong, the leader of the swordsmen unit White War troops, one of the five Murim Association units, approached the man and held his shoulders.\nContrary to his anger, he spoke in a relaxed manner.\n“They aren’t stupid people. To think they would hit this association with that much power.”\n“Leader Baek Cheon’s words were right.”\nShh!\nBaek Cheon, the leader of another unit, came up to them and clicked his tongue.\n“Because of what they did in the Jinan city, the association was trying to put pressure on them, but it didn’t work out because they ended up coming here.”\n“I guess so. We can certainly deal with the remnants of the Cult using this as an excuse.”\nHang-ryong agreed.\nKam Cheok, who regained his calmness, spoke with a cold face while looking at the cultists who got down the truck.\n“I guess so. You are right. They just entered the tiger’s jaw on their own accord, they don’t know what they are doing.”\nThe only way out was blocked by 3,000 warriors.\nMoreover, the main office they were standing in front of wasn’t any random place.\nOne of the Five Great Warriors, Hyun Won-gyeong, the Song Yang Swordsman, and the other strong executives were having a meeting inside.\nAnd probably realizing the situation, they would be coming out at any second.\nIt was literally the worst scenario for the Cult.\nTap!\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun came out of the front seat.\nHu Bong, Mun Ran-yeong and Shakena followed behind him along with Bi Mak-heon.\nWhen Chun Yeowun walked to the back of the truck, the Cult members went down on one knee and bowed, shouting.\n“Long Live the Great Sky Demon Order!”\nAnd with that, everyone knew that Chun Yeowun was the leader.\n‘Is that one the lord of the remaining members of the Cult?’\nThe older warriors couldn’t hide their curiosity.\nThey had been fighting the disintegrated Cult, the Black Sky Company, for several times, so they knew all their faces.\n‘Who the hell is he?’\n‘When did they have such a young man among them?’\nJust looking at his face, it was clear that the man was in his early 20s.\nEven when they tried to sense how strong he was, because of the EV field, they couldn’t know anything.\n‘Huh! It doesn’t matter! They are the ones we need to deal with, nothing else matters!’\nKam Cheok, the Golden Dragon Sword, came forward and shouted.\n“How dare you Demonic Cult raid the association! I guess your lives aren’t worth much. Why don’t you get down on your knees and surrender to us right now!”\nSeeing how widely the voice resounded, people knew how strong he was.\n‘As expected from the Golden Dragon Sword!’\n‘Indeed, the leader of the vanguard!’\nThe warriors who were feeling encouraged with it, yelled.\n“Surrender now!!!”\nAnd they seemed to work well together.\nHu Bong, who was next to Chun Yeowun, felt so annoyed that he ended up asking.\n“Lord. Please let me kill them all right now.”\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun raised his hand and made a gesture to Hu Bong, asking him to stay still.\nHe then took a step closer to the warriors.\nAnd said.\n“Listen, you Murim Association people.”\nIt wasn’t even a shout, just a normal voice talking.\nNevertheless, everyone in that place could hear it clearly.\nIf it wasn’t for the EV, those with weak internal energy might have suffered internal injuries.\n‘What amazing power!’\nThe faces of the leaders went stiff.\nBeing Superior Masters, the moment they heard Chun Yeowun’s voice, they realized the difference in strength.\nAnd it was so shocking that they felt a chill run down their spines.\nChun Yeowun continued.\n“Very foolishly, you people have committed a grave mistake by showing hostility to the Great Sky Demon order.”\nWith those words, Chun Yeowun turned his head and looked at the main office.\n“Today, the Murim Association will pay the price.”\nPhat!\nAs soon as he said that, Chun Yeowun sprinted into the air.\nThe Murim warriors of the association were shocked at the man who kept climbing up as if he was stepping in the air.\n“Unbelievable!”\n“What speed!”\nThat was something that only a few people could do.\nNormally, he would have just shot up at once, but because of the EV field, he had to use the energy in his body to move.\n‘What is he trying to do?’\nThe eyes of the warriors were focused on Chun Yeowun, who continued to climb.\nIt was when he climbed till the 20th floor when Chun Yeowun pretended to grab something with both hands.\nGrab!\nAt that moment, something hazy was caught in Chun Yeowun’s hand, and then turned into a giant sword.\nThe warriors watching it couldn’t help but be shocked.\nIt was nothing like a sword.\n“N-No way.”\n“I-is that an invisible sword?”\nThe size of the invisible sword in Chun Yeowun’s hands was 20 meters long.\nDespite being that grand distance, the sharp energy could be felt.\n“D-Divine Master level?”\nOnly those who reached the Divine Master level could do this.\nHowever, the size of the sword was too weird and large.\nJust how much energy would be needed to create an invisible sword of that size.\n“Wa-wait a minute! What is he trying to do!”\nKam Cheok stared at that in shock.\nThe direction at which Chun Yeowun was holding the sword was towards the office\n“This is what happens.”\nAs soon as Chun Yeowun said that, he swung the huge sword in his hand.\nWooong!\nThe blade of the invisible sword struck the roof tile of the office.\nKwang!\nWith a loud roar, the tiles began to fall all around the office, and the blade of the sword pierced into the underside.\n“S-stop it!”\n“Nooo!”\nThe warriors’ eyes were wide as they screamed.\nKwakwakwang!\nThe office which was modeled after the old building of the Forces of Justice was being split in half.",

      "content": "Chapter 100: Surrender (1)\nThe conference room on the 30th floor of Murim Association’s main office building.\nThe soundproofing was so good and so was the view.\nThe best place to hold a meeting\nAnd right in the middle of it.\nStartle!\nDirector General Kwon Jeong-won and Hyun Won-kyung, the advisor of the Murim Association, turned at the same time in a certain direction.\nIt was then.\nKwaang! Rumble!\nEverything shook violently as if an earthquake occurred beneath their feet.\nExcept for those who were participating through holograms, everybody jumped in surprise.\n“W-what the hell is this!”\n“It has to be an earthquake… gasp!”\nThey could see it clearly.\nRight through the window, something huge was hitting the building.\n‘No way!’\nHyun Won-kyung, the Sung Yang Swordsman, was shocked at it.\nIf his senses were being on alert, then that thing had to be an invisible sword.\n‘Is that an invisible sword?’\nThe fact that an invisible sword was being used was surprising in itself.\nHowever, what he was seeing now seemed to be beyond common sense.\n-Chhk! What is happening over…\n-The communication is giving me static on your side… click!\nThe holograms flickered and the signal went out.\nKwang!\n“Ugh!”\nThe ceiling cracked and the huge invisible sword invaded the room.\nAll the lights went off at once.\n‘Shit!’\nDirector General Kwon Jeong-won hurriedly drew his sword and cut a window.\n“Everyone! Jump out!”\nAlthough they were in a tall building, it was better to move away than stay in such a place.\n“Just what is happening!”\nMun Jeong-seo, the representative and deputy president of the association, mumbled as if this was ridiculous, and then immediately moved to the window.\nThe other executives managed to focus on jumping out.\nKwakwakwa!\nThe invisible sword which struck from above took the building down.\nIt precisely cut the building in half.\nShould they be glad?\nThat the building was cut in half and not the floor collapsed?\nHowever.\n“Kyaaak!”\n“Ahhh!”\nThe people who were inside the building decided to run out.\nAs the building cracked, debris fell down and dust rose around.\nThose who were quick managed to escape right away.\nAnd those who were higher up or in the middle floors were crushed down between the floors.\n“Association… the building is down….”\n“How did this…”\nThe warriors, who were watching the scene unfold, couldn't hide their dismay.\nHowever, that feeling didn’t last long.\nThe feeling of guilt for not being able to save the building and create the worst situation for the Murim Association was replaced by anger.\n“How dare you! You filthy demons!, this holy place of Murim…”\n“The cultists need to be killed right away!”\n“Punish those demons!”\nThe mass movement was truly amazing.\nAs one or two people shouted their anger, the others felt encouraged.\nThey had witnessed their main office being cut down right in front of their eyes, but the fact that they were superior in number seemed to have helped lower their fears.\nTak!\nChun Yeowun landed on the ground and looked at the office building as if it was a wonderful sight.\nThe Murim Associations office, which was cut in half, looked miserable.\n‘Isn't Lord Chun Ma going too far?’\nAlthough BI Mak-heon looked at the scene in awe, he was worried that Chun Yeowun wasted too much of his energy.\nRight now, all the energy which was being brought out to use techniques was being dispersed by the EV field.\nAnd Chun Yeowun created a huge invisible sword, which surely would have consumed a lot of internal energy.\n‘You used a crazy amount of internal energy, now you are done.’\nIt wasn’t just the allies who had those thoughts.\nThe leaders of the armed groups of the Murim Association believed that Chun Yeowun made a mistake as well.\nJust bringing out sword energy in a dispersed EV field was tough, and this man had just created an invisible sword.\n‘Even if he was at Divine Master level, there will be a limit to his internal energy.’\nAnd they thought they would have a chance now.\nAt that moment, a group of men appeared in the direction of Chun Yeowun.\nAt that, the warriors shouted.\n“Woow!”\nThey were the executives who jumped out of the building.\nAt the forefront was a middle-aged man with eyes full of anger.\nIt was Hyun Won-kyung.\nIn his hand was the famous Sariwon Sword.\nSince it was a famous sword, it meant it was crafted at least 10 years ago.\n“It is Song Yang Swordsman!”\nOne of the Five Great Warriors was standing there.\nThe name Five Great Warriors gave them confidence.\nIn addition, the other executives weren’t that weak either.\n‘There is Ho Ji-seon, Biryu Seong of Zhejiang and Yeon Woo-kang of Jongnam clan.’\nBi Mak-heon gulped at the sight.\nAll of them were amazing warriors in the modern Murim world and were all Superior Master levels or higher.\nHe heard that they had resigned from being active on duty, but it seemed like they held onto their executive position.\n“Mak-heon. Where is the chairman?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s question, Bo Mak-heon shook his head and said,\n“He doesn’t seem to be present.”\n“Vice-chairman?”\n“Not there. But the one who is the centre of this association is there.”\nThe person Bi Mak-heon pointed to was Kwon Jeong-won.\nThe person ranking highest except for the chairman and vice-chairman.\n“Tch, we came to rob an empty house?”\nChun Yeowun clicked his tongue.\nHe was hoping to deal with the chairman and vice-chairman of the Murim Association, who were known to be the current head of the Blade Six and the Ohsin group.\nWhen he was told that both weren’t present, Chun Yeowun felt irritated.\nGrunt!\n‘How dare the remnants of the Cult ignore me?’\nIt was Mun Jeong-seo, the aide of the chairman of the Murim Association and the one next in line to be the head of the Ohsin group. A man with power.\nHe was being treated as if he didn’t exist at all, and it was natural that his pride would be hurt.\n“Advisor.”\nMun Jeong-seo called for Hyun Won-kyung.\n“Yes, chairman’s representative?”\n“Are you going to let them insult the association? Don’t you think that this situation needs to be taken care of? Let’s work together.”\nAlthough he was a man with pride, Mun Jeong-seo wasn’t an idiot.\nHe knew that going in alone wouldn’t work.\n“Hmm.”\nHyun Won-kyung seemed worried about something.\nHe knew that it was difficult to deal with Chun Yeowun alone.\nHowever, his Five Great Warriors title was holding him by the ankles.\n‘This is good.’\nMun Jeong-seo gave the right justification so this seemed nice.\n“Since the representative of the chairman is saying it, there is nothing I can do about it. Let’s try to suppress them quickly with no casualties on our side.”\n“We will help too.”\n“Let’s show those foolish cultists what justice is.”\nSrr!\nAs if waiting, the other executives pulled their swords at once.\nThey had the same thought as Hyun Won-kyung.\nMun Jeong-seo, who confirmed that all were acting, shouted at the warriors.\n“The representative of the chairman and the other executives will deal with the evil demonic Cult, so the others can take care of those minions!”\nIf the top executives were going to deal with Chun Yeowun, and the 3,000 warriors would deal with the minions, then they would definitely be able to win against the Demonic Cult.\nAnd thanks to the EV field, the association had the advantage.\nBecause of their numbers.\n‘I’ll trample that bastard!’\nMun Jeong-seo looked at Chun Yeowun.\nAnd just as he was about to send a signal to the executives.\nShhhh!\n‘Uh?’\nSomething hazy appeared in front of him.\nIt was Hu Bong.\n“How dare you stare at him? I’ll gouge your eyes out!”\n‘Fast!’\nStill, he could tackle it.\nMun Jeong-seo hurriedly tried to stab Hu Bong in the neck with his sword.\nBut Hu Bong just lightly brushed it off.\nShh!\n‘W-what power…’\nThe hand holding the sword felt like it was being ripped.\nHe barely managed to get back the sword when something swiftly flew in his vision.\nShhh!\nIt was Hu Bong’s two fingers!\nHe was really trying to gouge out his eyes\n‘No!’\nThe man was too fast for Mun Jeong-seo to dodge.\nAt that moment, a sharp blade cut through Hu Bong’s arm.\nSlash!\nHu Bong avoided it by moving a bit back, but he didn’t want to give up on pulling out the eyes.\nIt was Hyun Won-kyung, who restrained Hu Bong.\nHe was the only one who could read Hu Bong’s movements.\n‘Ugh, I was in trouble!’\nHyun Won-kyung’s expression darkened.\nJust looking at Hu Bong’s movements, he knew that the man was on the same level as him.\nTill now, he thought that the young man was the only strong one here, but now he realized that a couple others seemed to be on the same level as him.\n‘Since when did the Demonic Cult get this strong?’\nThe other people were also shocked.\nNot a single person could see Hu Bong move.\n“Deal with that one first!”\nMun Jeong-seo was angry at the fact that he was almost hit by that man, so he shouted at the executives to aim for Hu Bong first.\n“Alright!”\nBiryu Seong brought out his sword to help in taking down Hu Bong.\nAnd then, someone appeared next to him.\n“I shall take care of you. Human.”\nShakena, with her purple hair fluttering around, jumped off the ground and tried to hit Biryu Seong on his feet.\n‘This stupid bitch!’\nBiryu Seong held back a smile.\nHe planned on cutting off the leg of the woman who was trying to hurt him.\nBut.\nPang!\n“Huh?”\nRather than the legs being cut off, the sword which was loaded with sword energy, broke?\nClank!\nShakena didn’t stop and slammed Biryu Seong’s shoulder.\nPush!\n“Kwak!”\nAs if made of mud, the shoulders quickly dug to the sides of his body, which soon greeted the ground below.\nKwang! Crack!\nA crack of about 3 meters.\nWhat unbelievable power.\nBiryu Seong, whose body was crushed, soon stopped moving.\n“Shit. Killed him.”\nShakena, who said that, smiled and put her hands on the dead man’s chest.\nPulling the heart out, she chewed on it as if she was eating an apple.\nBite!\n“So delicious!”\n“W-what the fuck is that bitch doing!”\nYeon Woo-kang, of the Jongnam clan, was furious at her.\nHowever, contrary to his words, his body didn’t move.\nThe others were shocked at what the woman did, but soon they turned their heads.\nAt that time.\n“Aah! My eyes! My eyes…”\nHu Bong dug out the eyes of Mun jeong-seo.\nThe strongest disciple and member of the Murim Association who had reached the Superior Master level’s end, couldn’t even stop Hu Bong.\nThe gap in their skills seemed too huge.\n“Told you I’d gauge your eyes out. Hehe.”\nHu Bong smiled sarcastically as he looked at the blood-filled eyes.\n“How dare you!”\nHyun Won-kyung, who couldn’t calm himself, tried to attack him.\nBut was blocked by someone.\n“A bitch?”\nShe was Mun Ran-yeong.\n“If you want to fight my husband, you need to go through me first.”\n‘Husband?’\nIt wasn’t shocking that they were a couple.\nRather, it was shocking that she held his wrist without effort.\n“Let go!”\nHyun Won-hyung tried to make her release the hand she was holding by using his sword.\nNormally, people would let go of the hand to avoid getting hit, but Mun Ran-yeong didn’t seem to care about it and put her hand on his chest.\nWheik!\nThe chest of Hyun Won-kyung began to turn hot.\nAnd at some point, his body bounced back.\nPapapk!\n“Kuak!”\nThud!\nAs he was pushed back almost 20 meters, he knelt down and coughed up blood.\nHe looked up at the woman with shocked eyes.\n‘Wh-who the hell is this woman?’\nHe thought about how many times he had been beaten since he reached the Supreme Master level.\nWhen the woman hit him in the chest, he couldn’t even counter it.\n‘Just what is this…?’\n‘How can the executives be handled this easi…’\nThe warriors who were cheering and sure of their win a moment ago, were confused.\nWhat was more shocking was that the executives were being suppressed by the subordinates and not Chun Yeowun.\n“What are you doing! Are you all going to stand still and watch?”\nKwon Jeong-won shouted at the warriors.\nThey couldn’t be dealt with one-on-one.\nThey had to try with a joint effort.\nHearing that, the leader of the vanguard gave the orders.\n“Th-the man is ri…”\nIt was then.\nChun Yeowun, who stood still until then, stepped ahead.\nStep! Step!\nHe was just walking, but the dark intimidation was too overwhelming that all the warriors flinched.\nChun Yeowun spoke to them.\n“I will give you all a chance.”\n“A chance?”\nChun Yeowun gave the Murim Association warriors the worst choice.\n“Kneel down.”\n‘!!!’\nAll the faces went stiff.\nTo kneel meant to surrender.\nAt those words, Kam Cheok raised his voice with a red face.\n“Kneel down? Unless you are crazy, you would never dare say those word…”\nSlash!\nKam Cheok’s body was split in half.\nAnd in front of the split body, stood Chun Yeowun.\n“Shit!”\n“W-when?”\nWheik!\nShocked by seeing him suddenly stand that close, the warriors immediately retreated.\nAnd Chun Yeowun spoke again.\n“Kneel down. And then I will accept you as members of the Great Sky Demon Order.”\nA voice full of arrogance.\nBut no one thought of it as simple arrogance.\nChun Yeowun’s intimidation was so heavy that no one had another thought.\n‘W-what is this!’\nKwon Jeong-won couldn’t accept it.\nDid it make sense for one person to scare off 3,000 warriors of the association?\nGrunt!\nUnable to stand that, he ended up shouting.\n“What are you all doing! It’s just one man! Just one man! Are you all going to fall for his tricks?? He can’t even use his power because of the EV field!”\nThe leader of another unit, Hang-ryeong, who had also retreated in fear, shouted at the warriors.\n“Director is right! If it’s just one person, we don’t need to…”\nChun Yeowun sighed and then laughed at that.\n“EV field right? I have experienced this once before, and it is annoying.”\n“You experienced it before?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, Hang-ryeong couldn’t hide his doubts and frowned.\nHe didn’t understand what Chun Yeowun was talking about.\nChun Yeowun continued.\n“But do you really think the same technique will work on me again?”\n“What?”\nChun Yeowun stretched out his palm towards the air.\nAnd the warriors looked up to see what he was doing.\nAt that moment, an amazing thing occurred.\nThe entire space around them vibrated.\n“W-what the hell is that?”\n“The sky is?”\nIt was as if the sky was shaking.\nAnd it only got worse and worse.\nChun Yeowun pulled something hard, as if intending to tear off the sky.\n“Y-You, what are you doing?”\nHang-ryeong shouted at what was happening around.\nIt was then.\nBreak!\nSomething bounced all around the ground.\nIt wasn’t the end.\nCracks appeared on the floor, and then explosions occurred at the same time on the north, south, east and west.\nCrack!\nKwon Jeong-won, who looked at the explosions, shuddered.\nThe place where the explosions happened were where all the units operating the EV field were stationed.\n‘No way!’\nNot long after the explosion.\nThe nature energy, which was scattered till then, filled the space.\nThe warriors, who sensed that, were shocked.\n“How…just how… how…”\nChun Yeowun spoke to those who didn’t believe it.\n“If you want to overcome power, you should use a stronger power.”",

      "content": "Chapter 101: Surrender (2)\nChun Yeowun, who had been through an EV field once before, knew just how annoying it was.\nSo, for a long time, he thought about how to destroy that thing with the help of Nano.\nAnd one of the solutions was to overload the EV field.\nWhat would happen if the EV field was continuously infused with energy to the point it couldn’t handle it anymore?\nIt was a gamble.\nAs expected, Chun Yeowun was able to do it.\n“A stronger power?”\nThe leaders of each unit were shocked.\nWas that even possible?\nHyun Won-kyung, who was watching this happen, was the most shocked.\n‘How did this happen…’\nAs a Supreme Master, he had a better understanding of energy than others.\nThose who crossed the line of the Superior Master level would attain a greater understanding of energy.\nHe was able to be conscious of all energies.\nThe energy in nature too.\n‘More energy than the scattered one has entered the area.’\nThe sky was shaking too.\nThe cohesion and decomposition occurred at the same time, as if space itself was affected.\n‘He can freely handle the energy within nature…’\nIt was unheard of.\nBut he heard something about it from the chairman.\n[If you go beyond the state of Divine Master level, you can reach a stage where you can influence the energy of nature]\n“Heavenly Master level!”\nOnly those who attained that realm could do that.\nHyun Won-kyung felt a shiver down his body.\n‘He really reached the legendary level?’\nIt had been said that only five warriors in the entire history of Murim had reached it.\nThe first monk in the Shaolin.\nSambong, of the Wudang clan, who reached it by attaining enlightenment.\nThe first Chun Ma, creator of the Demonic Cult.\nThe Blade God.\nAnd then Chun Yeowun, the Demon God who ruled above them all, had also reached that level.\n‘Did that man really reach the stage that only legends were said to have attained? After a thousand years?’\nHyun Won-kyung’s eyes were filled with awe.\nHe was already shocked when he guessed that the young man was at Divine Master level, but realising that someone surpassed the legend, he felt weird.\n‘The sixth warrior to reach Heavenly master level!’\nWrong.\nChun Yeowun was the same fifth one.\nSince he was unaware of it, it was natural to regard this man as a new Heavenly Master.\n[Director General!]\nHyun Won-kyung, who was shocked, sent a message to Director General Kwon Jeong-won.\nHe wanted to let him know.\n[If my guess is right, then that person is at Heavenly Master level. No matter how many of the association go against him, they won't be able to beat him.]\n[W-what? Heavenly Master level?]\nNot able to believe it, he turned to Hyun Won-kyung.\nIt was something he couldn’t believe.\nHe was shocked that Chun Yeowun managed to destroy the EV field too, but the thought of him being a Heavenly Master level did never cross his mind.\n[It can’t be. The Heavenly Master level is… a legend…]\nCreepy!\nThe director general stopped talking as a cold energy spread past his body.\n‘!!!’\nAnd then came the most unbelievable sight.\nInnumerable Ice Swords were created in the sky at once, all over the Murim Association.\nCrackle!\nThere were so many that it was difficult to even count.\nAt the sight of the Ice Swords filling the sky above, the warriors couldn’t get themselves to shut their mouths.\nWhisper!\n“What… just what am I looking at?”\n“Is he human?”\n“How can human energy do th…”\nInhumane.\nThe word couldn’t be more appropriate.\nChun Yeowun raised his hand towards the sky, and it made everyone feel as if he was holding his finger over a button that would launch a nuclear bomb.\n‘Impossible.’\nThe leaders were all shocked at it.\nEven if Ice Swords could be created, they thought that handling them would be impossible.\nUnless the human brain was a computer, it was impossible to handle so many Ice Swords.\n‘No. this might be our chance, when he is focused on the Ice Swords, we can strike.’\nBaek Cheon, the leader of a unit, thought.\nThe distance between Chun Yeowun and them was 10 meters.\nIt wasn’t far.\nAnd if he used his own technique, then he could be there at once.\n[Can you hear me?]\nBaek cheon sent a message to the others.\nTo attack at the same time from multiple directions. If Chun Yeowun notices and tries to respond, he wouldn’t be able to deal with it all.\n‘Now!’\nBaek Cheon tried to send a hand signal.\nIt was then.\nSwoosh! Swosh! Swoosh!\nKwang! Bang! Kwang!\nWith a ray of blue light, something passed through the heads of the leaders.\nWithout even having a chance to realize it, they fell down.\n‘Uh-how?’\nBaek Cheon, who was about to move, stood still.\nChun Yeowun spoke to him with a sneer.\n“Thanks for being an example.”\n“What?”\nAt that time, he felt something in the air.\nBaek Cheon blocked it with defense.\nClang!\nWhat was falling down was an Ice Sword.\nNot one.\n“This… this is…”\nKwakwakwang!\nDozens were coming for Baek Cheon, and his whole body, which failed to stop the swords, was pierced.\nBy the time his screams were over, only swords could be seen from his body.\nDazzling blue sky.\nThe Ice Swords which filled the sky were shining in blue.\nSurprise and shock.\nAnd then the thoughts turned into despair and fear.\nChun Yeowun spoke with an intimidating voice to the warriors, who were all staring at the sky.\n“Kneel down.”\nThat voice that entered their ears.\nThe upright knees of the Murim people, who seemed to never give in, were bent.\n‘No! No!’\nDirector General Kwon Jeong-won, who was watching the scene, was standing wide-eyed.\nHe then collapsed.\nThud! Thud!\nThe knees of people around Chun Yeowun touched the floor.\nAnd it spread like a wave as all 3,000 warriors fell to their knees.\nLosing their courage to fear.\nIn front of one person.\n“I… for me to see such a sight…”\nBi Mak-heon, who was looking at this, felt the warm tears forming in his eyes.\nIt was the same with the other members of the Cult.\nFor 27 years, the Sky Demon Order was living in the shadows with their heads bowed.\nBut now, they saw the entire Murim Association being trampled in front of their eyes.\n“Tch. It would be better to kill them all.”\nHu Bong was dissatisfied with this.\nIf it would have been Chun Yeowun’s normal way, everyone would have been mercilessly killed.\nHowever, in the present era where Gates have opened.\nIf all of them were killed, the manpower to stop the Gates would be reduced.\nAnd this was enough victory.\nThis wasn’t some random place, but the main site of the association.\nThe biggest ripple was caused by the Murim Association.\nTak!\nChun Yeowun received the surrender, went back to normal.\nThe members of the Cult shouted.\n“Chun Ma! Chun Ma! Chun Ma! Chun Ma!”\n“Great Sky Demon Order! Long live!”\nGrunt!\nKwon Jeong-won and other executives grunted at the sight.\nAn irreversible situation.\nIn a situation where even Chun Yeowun’s subordinates couldn’t be taken down, what could they even do?\nIf this fact would spread around, then the honor of the association would suffer.\n‘To think the absence of some executives would hit us this big.’\nMost of the executives weren’t in this place.\nUnlike the past, it was difficult to gather all the members of the association except for a rare occasion.\nEven the Chairman and vice-chairman were not present at the meetings.\nAnd that led to this.\nDrip!\nBlood flowed from the hand which was clenching too hard.\nThe Director General thought to himself.\n‘This is just the Great Revival!’\nGreat Revival.\nTo stay back and get all the suffering all in order to get revenge.\nIt was a saying which was taken after the fact that a person once tasted the worst humiliation to get revenge.\n‘Endure this.’\nThey had no other choice but to retreat.\nThis was going to be a momentary victory of the Cult.\n‘You people will all regret it. You touched the centre of the Murim Association and hastened your destruction.’\nKwon Jeong-won looked at Chun Yeowun.\nIf only he died, then dealing with the Cult would be a lot easier.\nHe was analysing on how to deal with a Heavenly Master.\nAt that time, Chun Yeowun gave an order.\n“Bring them.”\n“Yes!”\nThe members went to the cargo truck and moved a large box.\nThe warriors looked at it with puzzled eyes.\nAfter putting out 50 boxes side by side, the members stood in front of them as if they were going to distribute food.\nChun Yeowun spoke to the warriors.\n“Those who swore allegiance to our Cult. Come one after one and get this injection.”\n‘!?’\nThe faces of the warriors hardened.\nWhat was the injection?\nThe Cult members standing in front of the large boxes pulled syringes out.\n‘Poison?’\n‘Shit!’\nThe warriors couldn’t hide their shock.\nThey had surrendered considering that this would save their lives, but they had the same thoughts as the Director General too.\nIt was their promise to the future.\nHowever, that was being trampled on right now.\n“… what the hell is this?”\nOne of the executives asked.\nChun Yeowun spoke as if it was nothing.\n“Nano bomb.”\n“N-nano bomb?”\nWhisper.\nThe word nano bomb brought extreme confusion.\nSo they were going to get nano bombs injected in them?\n‘This is crazy!’\nDirector General Kwon Jeong-won looked at the Cult’s cargo truck with an absurd expression.\n‘So this is what it was.’\nSomething was constantly bothering him.\nHe thought that it was strange that a monster like Chun Yeowun had only brought 50 Cult members with him who weren’t of much power, except for the Flame qi users.\n‘Was it because of the… truck that they were dragged here…?’\nDirector Kwon Jeong-won’s guess was correct.\nThis was why the truck wasn’t abandoned.\nThis was why he used Shakena’s phasing ability.\nBae Hyun-jae, the executive who couldn’t hold back the anger, yelled.\n“What is all this? Even though we surrendered to you? Is there no respect for the losers?”\nShhhh!\n\"Eiik!\"\nSuddenly, Chun Yeowun approached him.\nBaek Hyun-jae, who was flustered, tried to defend himself.\nHowever.\nPuck!\n“Kuak!”\nChun Yeowun’s light kick made his leg twist and fall down.\nHolding his hair, Chun Yeowun said.\n“You are quite a funny one.”\n“Kuak!”\n“What reason do I have to trust you?”\n“Th-that…”\n“Are you trying to say something like, we got down on our knees so everything is fine?”\n“F… formally pap…”\nPull!\n“Kuaaak!”\nIt felt as if the hair was being ripped off.\nGrabbing the hair, Chun Yeowun dragged him to a place where the other warriors could see him clearly.\nAnd then he spoke in a cold voice.\n“I guess you don’t remember what you did to the Cult.”\nAt those words, the faces of the warriors darkened.\nThe Murim Association desperately worked on dissolving the Sky Demon Order 27 years ago.\nEven when the lord was taken away to a secret prison, they forced the members of the Cult to live as fugitives.\n“I will show you for sure.”\nTak!\nChun Yeowun pressed his hand on Bae Hyun-jae’s shoulder and pulled the hair back.\nThe man kept on shouting in pain.\n‘Wh-what is he doing…’\nGrab!\n“Achhhhh!”\nChun Yeowun kept pulling.\nTill.\nThe head was pulled off from the body.\nDrip!\nBlood spurted from the throat and splashed all around.\n‘Shit!’\n‘He pulled out the head from the hair…’\nAt the brutal sight which just happened in front of them, the warriors ended up turning away their heads.\nChun Yeowun lifted the head in his hand and said.\n“You lost to the Cult and are now slaves. If you don’t like it, say it out now. A loser’s choice is surrender or death.”\nThud!\nWith those words, he threw the head in his hand aside.\nDespite seeing him disrespect the man, no one could shout.\nEveryone was already gripped with fear.\nThe results soon came.\nThe warriors lined up to get the nano bombs injected into them.\nThe reality was too horrific for them to act like heroes.\n‘Shit!’\nKwon Jeong-won and the other executives had wretched faces.\nThey tried to move slowly.\nThey were still deciding whether to choose honor and die or shame and live.\nBut.\n“Who told you all to get in line?”\n“W-what do you mean?”\n“Didn’t you tell us to make a choice?”\nThe executives were perplexed.\nThey thought that they could get the injection and save themselves.\n“You need to pay the price.”\n“Pri-price?”\nChun Yeowun’s words made no sense to them.\n“I need you all to be dead.”\nClick!\nWhen the office line was cut off, the hologram device was powered off.\nHowever, there will be an emergency generator right?\nWheing\n!\nAnd the hologram device got activated.\nThe sound of rumbling.\nSoon after, the executives appeared.\nThe only person who couldn’t be seen was the chairman and vice-chairman, who sent Mun Jeong-seo as the representative.\nAs they tried to reconnect, some rumbling could be heard.\n-Huh?\n-This?\nThe severed heads of the Murim Association executives.\nThe hair was discolored as if they were frozen to death.\nAll their expressions were painful.\n-They… why are they…\nThe hologram executives couldn’t hide their confusion at the sight.\nAt the same time, someone sat down in the chair where the chairman should be sitting.\nIt was Chun Yeowun.\n“Lucky. Survivors.”\nChun Yeowun said sarcastically.\nThe angry hologram executives didn’t hold back.\n-Who are you?\n-How dare you do this!\nChun Yeowun answered.\n“I am the Chun Ma of the Great Sky Demon Order.”\n‘!?’\nAt those words, the speaker to the hologram device went silent as if it stopped working at once.",

      "content": "Chapter 102: Surrender (3)\n-Sky Demon Order… Demonic Cult!\nThe Forces of Justice never called the Sky Demon Order by its name.\nThey have always considered them the group that worshipped the demons.\n‘Demonic Cult?’\nThe eyes of the executives of the Murim Association, who were wary of the reappearance of the Demonic Cult, were full of shock.\nThe Demonic Cult was in the main office.\nIn the head office, inside the conference room.\n‘No way… did the main office fall into the hands of the Cult?’\nEven though it was a hologram, their confused expressions were clear.\nIn order to get to sit on the chairman's seat in the conference room, he had to go through the entire force.\n‘No way!’\nThey wanted to be positive but it was hard to deny.\nThe heads of the executives were scattered on the conference table.\nThis was truly terrifying.\nJust an hour ago, it seemed like they were talking about the Demonic Cult in Jinan city.\nThey were planning on punishing them.\n‘Since when was the Cult...’\nThe Demonic Cult had always suffered.\nWho would have imagined that the dissolved Demonic Cult would somehow enter the main office?\n-Wait… did he say Chun Ma?\nAn old monk’s hologram opened his mouth.\nJust looking at the yellow robes with red lines, anyone could see he was a monk.\n-Amitabha. Is it the Chun Ma who is the legend?\n‘Oh?’\nAt the words of the saint Nogak, Chun Yeowun was shocked.\nThere were a few people who weren’t members of the Sky Demon order and knew the meaning of the Chun Ma.\n‘Actually, the Shaolin temple might be aware of this.’\nTheir history was longer and wider than any clan.\nEven more than the Sky Demon Order.\n“As expected from the saint of Shaolin, it’s very like you to have such an insight.”\nEven in the past, the Shaolin temple never did any bad, so Chun Yeowun spoke with a soft voice.\nAt that, the other executives looked at Saint Nogak with puzzled eyes.\n-For the Cult to have a Chun Ma born within. For the Forces of Justice, this is very sad news.\n-Saint Nogak, what do you mean?\n-Amitabha. This isn’t the time to speak about it.\nExplaining it now was hard.\nAnd the appearance of the Chun Ma wasn’t something to be discussed so lightly.\n-What the he…\nThe executives were even more curious now, and someone with a red face shouted.\n-Is that title so important now? Those damned cultists have harmed the association warriors!\nThe man wearing a neat white robe was Jang Pyeong-gak, a long-time scholar of the Wudag clan.\nAlthough he was a warrior who was supposed to hide his feelings and calm himself, he spoke in anger.\nHe glared at Chun Yeowun and shouted.\n-This is why it is said that evil people like you should never be left alone. Because of what you people have done, the Gate disaster strikes, and the damage inflicted on the people….\nSnap!\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun snapped his fingers.\nAnd the hologram in the middle of the table turned on and something was played.\nThe situation outside the office.\n-Sky Demon Order! Long live! Long live!\nPeople were cheering for the Cult.\nThere were too many people that not a single person’s face could be seen clearly other than the fact that they were warriors of the association.\n-How? Just how?\nJang Pyeong-gak was at a loss for words.\nHe thought that the people outside were hurt, wounded and even dead.\n-Why are they?\n“Why? Did you think that I killed them all?”\n-They, what are they doing?\n“They swore allegiance to the Cult.”\n‘!?’\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, the faces of Murim Association executives were distorted.\nIf what Chun Yeowun said was true, then it wasn’t that the office was destroyed, but the entire office fell into the hands of the Cult.\n‘How can warriors of justice yield to the demons?’\nJustice was what they meant.\nIf the executives were present, they would have killed them right away.\n“I will give you people a chance too.”\nSnap!\nChun Yeowun snapped his finger, and Bi Mak-heon dragged someone inside.\n“Kuak… please… please spare me.”\n‘!?’\nAt the appearance of that person, the executives frowned.\nThe man was the chairman’s representative, Mun Jeong-seo.\nWithout eyes, the face looked miserable.\n“I heard that he was someone close to the chairman of the Murim Association, but it is unfortunate that he is like this. Well it doesn’t matter. Because of him, I managed to get good information.”\nChun Yeowun spoke as if he was satisfied with it, and placed his hand on Mun Jeong-seo’s shoulder.\nUnlike the others who were dead, it seemed like this man decided to save his life by giving out the information.\n“This one is now born as a member of our Cult. I am a fair person. So I will give you all a chance too.”\n-A chance?\nChun Yeowun smiled at the executives.\n“Surrender to the Cult. If you sacrifice yourselves as the heads of each clan as a token of surrender, I will accept the clan as a subject under the Cult with a compassionate heart.”\nGrab!\nChun Yeowun pressed Mun jeong-seo’s shoulder.\n“T-thank you for the benevolence shown by the merciful Chun Ma!”\nThe man wasn't shouting in fear.\nWhen he, the chairman’s representative, acted like this, the executives saw that as a strong insult.\n-You jerk! You are crossing the line!\n-How dare you mock our association!\nUnable to hold their anger, the executives burst out.\nThey were asked to surrender.\nChun Yeowun said.\n“Gave up power and chose punishment…”\nNormally, it should be something said with a hint of pity, but the next words were.\n“Thank you. I too was thinking what to do if you accepted the chance.”\n-Wh-what?\nThe eyes of the executives were wide\nFrom the beginning, all Chun Yeowun did was humiliate them.\nChun Yeowun lightly placed his hand on the table and said.\n“From now, let’s break you down one after another. I’ll make sure we give you a thousand times worse pain than what you put the Cult through.”\nAs soon as the words were done, the table cracked.\nJjjkkk!\nThe entire table tore apart in an instant, and then.\nPhhh!\nThe huge table turned into dust.\nIn an instant, the executives went silent.\nBreaking a table was easy, but it was difficult to turn it into dust.\nThere was only one person who spoke after seeing that.\n-Do you think you can handle us?\nIn that seat of the hologram was the nameplate.\n[Geum Song-ryon, Vice Chairman of Murim Association]\nThe head of Blade Six, the current head of the Blade God Six Martial clan.\nChun Yeowun had been paying attention to this man more than anyone else.\nUnlike others, he had a poker face all the time.\n‘To come out at this moment…’\nChun Yeowun said to him.\n“You can expect a lot. And just like the true ‘leaders’ you have, I’ll uproot you this time for sure. Blade God Six Martial clan.”\n‘!?’\nAt those words, there was a change in the calm expression of Geum Song-ryong.\n-You…\nWhen he tried to ask something, Chun Yeowun made a light gesture.\nAll the devices of the hologram in the room crashed and the connection was cut off.\nAt the same time.\nIn the head office of Blade Six.\nGeum Song-ryong who was sitting in his room got up with a stiff face.\nAnd he hurried out of the room.\n“Chairman?”\nA man in a black suit and sunglasses outside the room called him.\nGeum Song-ryong said.\n“Book train tickets to Chengdu.”\n“Huh? But there is a meeting with outsourcing…”\n“Cancel it. We have urgent matters at hand.”\nIf the chairman said that, who could refuse it?\nThe man in the sunglasses tried to adjust the schedule on the tablet, but then went stiff.\n‘chengdu? If it is Chengdu…’\nGeum Song-ryeong mumbled in a serious voice.\n“I need to see them.”\nThe conference room in the Murim Association.\nThe emergency generator was barely working, since the building was cut.\n‘Is this fine?’\nBi Mak-heon looked at the hologram device which was broken.\n‘I think Chun Ma pushed them too much.’\nAlthough they took over the main office, the executives still had a lot of power.\nIn this case, the Cult did a surprise attack, but the next time would be a war.\nNo, maybe the association would fight back stronger than the Cult could expect.\n“Afraid?”\nAs if feeling his fear, Chun Yeowun asked.\nBi Mak-heon cautiously responded.\n“I am concerned about the moves of the Murim Department.”\n“The Department?”\nTo be honest, he wasn’t worried.\nAnd that was because of Chun Yeowun, who was strong.\n“With this, the Cult has risen again. And they will likely put pressure on us again.”\nMost of the warriors were registered as warriors in the Murim Department.\nThe only people who didn’t register were the Forces of Evil and the Demonic Cult members.\nAnd the Murim Association would aim for that.\n“If I was in the association, I would move the Murim Department to incite public opinion about the Cult.”\nSo far, the civilians had the worst image of the Sky Demon Order.\nIt was because of the bloodshed which happened in the hands of the chairman of the Black Sky Company.\n“If that happens, we will have a setback in running the company too.”\nThe Murim Department was full of people from the Murim Association.\nTheir absolute allies.\nIn one way or another, the Sky Demon Order was sure to have an unfavourable future.\nAnd that was also one of the reasons why the people of the Sky demon Order never came in front of the public.\n“Then what will your solution be?”\n“Solution?”\n“Did you think I put you beside me only to give me more problems to think about?”\nThe reason why Bi Mak-heon was appointed as his personal aide was because he was a strategist.\nPondering a moment, Bi Mak-heon said.\n“We need news which can offset the image of the Cult, which is bad now. And we need allies who support it. Even better if it is the government department which has enough power to keep that Murim department in check.”\n“Right. That is your main job.”\n‘Ah…’\nOnly then did he understand what Chun Yeowun expected him to do.\nThose who use their bodies for Chun Yeowun were already there\nBi Mak-heon was the brains.\n“Tell me the specific plan within three days.”\n‘T-three days!’\nJust 3 days.\nShort period.\nBi Mak-heon almost gasped.\nHowever, he didn’t want to break the expectations that Chun Yeowun had, so he nodded his head.\n“I will do as I am asked!”\n“I will take care of the latter part you said.”\n“Huh?”\nThe former was difficult and the latter was more difficult. There was no other department in the State Council that could keep a check on the Murim Department except for the Public Security and the Ministry of National Defense.\nThe Chun Yu-jang faction tried to make allies several times, but they failed each time.\n‘What does he plan on doing?’\nChun Yeowun mumbled as if he was talking to himself.\n“I need to call him.”\n‘Him?’\nShiyan city.\nA small town southeast of Xian, the capital of the Chinese government.\nFurther east from there was Nanyang city, where the headquarters of the Ministry of National Defense and Defense Forces was located.\nAn abandoned gas station located in the suburb of Nanyang.\nIt was a sparsely populated place, and there were vehicles with military marks engraved everywhere.\nThe surrounding area was marked by soldiers.\nNext to the abandoned gas station, there was a shabby restaurant.\nA strong-looking bearded middle-aged man with a fine leather jacket was sitting there while looking at his watch.\n“One minute left.”\nThe middle-aged man with a beard was sitting opposite to another person who couldn’t hide his embarrassment.\nHe was Mak Wu-cheong, the commander of the National Guard, in charge of Datong city.\nWearing a military uniform, with the mark of lieutenant general engraved on his shoulder.\nHe recently got a promotion in recognition of his efforts in blocking the S-class gate.\n‘Why hasn’t he come yet?’\nThis was a meeting.\nThe person in front of him was Ahn Woo-hong, the minister of National Defense.\nAfter receiving the medal for the achievement, Mak Wu-cheong struggled to convince the man to come to dinner.\n-Chick! No vehicles approaching.\nThe radio of the people standing guard could be heard.\nAnd with people checking for their safety, it was tough to extend this meeting any further.\n“The current time is 13:29:30. It makes no sense anymore.”\n“C-chief.”\n“I hope that in the future, you will not waste the time of your boss with this kind of thing.”\nTak!\nAhn Woo-hong stood up.\nHe was a military man, and he served as the commander-in-chief for seven years.\nAnd he was famous for being strict with punctuality.\n‘Ahhh…’\nTo get off on the wrong foot from the beginning, Mak Wu-cheong didn’t like this.\nAhn Woo-hong was leaving the restaurant.\nIntending to appease him, Mak Wu-cheong followed him and headed to where he was.\n“C-chief wait! Please wait...”\n“It’s too late…”\nThud!\n“Gasp!”\nSomething fell right in front of the door.\nAhn Woo-hong, who had a steel heart wasn’t surprised by anything else, but was startled and stepped back at the thought of a lightning falling there.\n“Si-Sir Chun!”\nMak Wo-cheong shouted.\nThe one who fell from the sky was Chun Yeowun.\nThe seconds hand on the watch of Ahn Woo-hong’s wrist was pointing to 59 seconds.",

      "content": "Chapter 103: Chakra (1)\nThe soldiers, who were on alert, didn’t even look up at the sky.\nFlustered by the sudden appearance of Chun Yeowun, who fell from the sky, they quickly ran towards him and aimed their guns while surrounding him.\nClick!\n“Move! Right now!”\nIn just a couple of seconds, dozens of people surrounded him.\nAnd one could see just how well trained these soldiers were.\n‘He fell from the sky?’\nAhn Woo-hong, the head of the Ministry of National Defense, looked at Chun Yeowun.\nHe wasn’t the kind to be shocked by anything.\nHowever, when he was leaving the place, and suddenly someone fell ahead of him, he ended up moving two steps back.\n“Khum.”\n“This is the man, Chun Mu-seong, I was talking about.”\nIn that bloody atmosphere, lieutenant general Mak Wu-cheong introduced Chun Yeowun.\nHe didn’t know the real name as the name recorded on the id card was different.\n“… he is Chun Mu-seong?”\n“That is right. You must be Ahn Woo-hong, the Minister of National Defense?”\nPeople who usually meet the ministers and directors in the government, they use respectful courtesy.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun was different.\n‘Hmm.’\nAhn Woo-hong examined Chun Yeowun thoroughly.\nLooking at the face, the man seemed to be young in his early 20s, but the air around him was surprisingly intimidating.\n‘This person defeated the S-class Alpha entity?’\nAhn Woo-hong had heard about Chun Yeowun from Mak Wu-cheong.\nAnd he was waiting to meet the person who had the power to deal with an S-rank Alpha entity, so he took time out of his busy schedule to meet him.\nSh!\nAs Ahn Woo-hong raised his hand, the soldiers who surrounded the man put down their guns.\nThe soldiers immediately went back to their assigned positions once the gesture fell.\nFaithful to orders.\n‘Military man?’\nThey seemed to be very thoroughly trained in the military.\nIt seemed like the head of the Ministry was also trained in the military.\n‘An interesting guy.’\nThat was the first impression Chun Yeowun had on Ahn Woo-hong.\nThe man had no martial arts or extraordinary abilities, but the inherent strength could be strongly felt.\nHe was once a soldier, and now, he was standing on the top with dignity just like a martial artist who had accumulated experience for years.\n‘He isn’t the kind to give in to power.’\nThis type of person would have to be convinced with reasoning.\nAhn Woo-hong looked at his watch and then at the cloudless sky.\n“I have known Murim for 27 years. I have seen a lot of strong people, but this is my first time seeing someone fly.”\n“It doesn’t look like you're that surprised.”\nAhn Woo-hong responded with a light smile.\n“In today’s world, how could we live if we get shocked at every single illogical thing? This is a world where thousands of people die every day.”\nA world with Gates.\nEach day holds unexpected things.\nAhn Woo-hong continued.\n“I heard from the lieutenant general. The Black Sky Company, no, the dissolved Sky Demon Order, is where you are from.”\nAhn Woo-hong, who decided to meet the man, had read all the available materials about the Cult.\nHe knew about how much influence they once had in the Murim world, and even about their current relationship with the Murim Associations.\n“Certainly, making a deal with us rather than the Murim Department and the Murim Association is worthy.”\nAhn Woo-hong knew that right away.\nIn order to break free from the influence of the Ministry of Murim, the Ministry of National Defense was also in a position to find people completely unrelated to the Murim Department.\nIn that aspect, the Sky Demon Order was the best.\n“However, the risk is high. If we join hands with your organization, even if we do our best, there will be many things our Defense department would have to work on.”\nIn the worst-case scenario, the image of the military would worsen in the eyes of the people.\nAhn Woo-hong pointed it outright at the beginning.\nHearing that, Chun Yeowun answered calmly.\n“It could be the other way around too. For example, a firm position in which the Ministry of National Defense is no longer swayed by the Ministry of Murim.”\nAhn Woo-hong smiled at that.\nHe then pointed to a field where there were no people, just a few abandoned buildings.\n“Why do you think I chose this place to meet?”\n“It seems like there are quite too many people just for the sake of security.”\nThe place was decent, and there were quite a lot of soldiers here for the sake of guarding and escorting. It was as if they were hoping to solve an issue.\n“I’ll tell you straight up. I’ve heard from the lieutenant general about your power and I’d like for you to prove it.”\n“Prove my power?”\n“As I said before, while working in the military, I have come across a great number of talented Murim warriors.”\nShhh!\nWith those words, Ahn Woo-hong motioned to someone.\nAnd one of the soldiers with a communication device went into a van and said something.\nA black van came and stopped right ahead of the restaurant.\nStep!\nTwo men came out of it.\nThey had dark brown skin and were definitely not from China.\nAlthough they were wearing suits, a white cloth was uniquely wrapped around their necks.\n‘Who are these people?’\nChun Yeowun’s eyes shone.\nChun Yeowun discovered a unique energy radiating within his body, the same energy he felt when he arrived.\n“???? ???? ?? ?? ???? ????? ??? ???????????? ???????”\nOne of them spoke in an unknown language.\nChun Yeowun ended up asking Nano.\n“Nano.”\n[It is in Hindi. Something like “This man will compete with us”.]\n‘Hindi?’\n[A language used by those in the Hindu region. Analysis of his appearance reveals that he is an Indian. Transfer Hindi to the brain?]\n‘Sure.’\nShhhh!\nAs soon as that was said, Hindi was transferred into Chun Yeowun’s mind.\nNano’s strength.\nTo learn a language very easily.\nStep!\nMeanwhile, the two Indians approached them.\nAt the same time, they joined both their palms into a praying position and spoke to Ahn Woo-hong.\n“Chief. Is this the time to make a decision?”\n“Ahh…”\nA little weird, but they could speak Chinese.\nThere were a few mistakes, but this was better than expecting others to understand their language.\nChun Yeowun asked Ahn Woo-hong.\n“These people?”\n“These two are warriors from the old Indian nation.”\nAt Ahn Woo-hong’s words, the two men again joined their palms and greeted Chun Yeowun.\n“I am Ashri Rao.”\n“And I am Sura Rao.”\nChun Yeowun took the initiative to greet them.\n“Chun… Mu-seong.”\nIt felt different to use an unfamiliar name.\nHowever, something was bothering him.\n‘Old India?’\nAt Chun Yeowun’s confusion, Nano answered him.\n[India of the present world couldn’t handle the Gate, and the government was disbanded. The surviving Indians fled to other nations.]\n‘Ahh…’\nThat was why it was being called Old India.\nWhat was the reason for bringing such people?\nAhn Woo-hong answered his thoughts.\n“I’ll be honest here. Before you made such a proposal, we were already in the middle of a negotiation with the Rao family, a warrior clan in old India.”\n‘I see now.’\nChun Yeowun understood the situation.\nAhn Woo-hong had been preparing to break free from the influence of the Ministry of Murim in his own ways.\nHe attracted the warrior family of old India, even non-Murims, to respond to the Gate dangers.\n“From the Ministry of National Defense point of view, the risk of the Rao clan is the same as yours.”\nListening to Ahn Woo-hong, it seemed like this clan was demanding an agreement with the National Defense too.\nAnd there were some guesses as to why.\nThere was only one reason why people who ran from their nation would do this.\n‘Revive their name.’\nAnd if that was right, then it was undoubtedly a huge risk for the National Defense.\nBlocking the Gate was too much alone. Even with the support from another nation’s people, it was too much of a gossip.\n“Our department knows that things could only be achieved if risks are taken.”\nAhn Woo-hong brought up the main topic.\n“So, I would gladly propose a bidding competition between the Sky Demon Order and the Rao clan.”\nThe conclusion was they battle it out and the side with the advantage would get the deal.\nThe expression of shock on the two Indians’ faces showed that it was their first time hearing about this.\nBut soon, confidence was back on their faces.\nThe bearded Indian Ashri spoke to Sura in Hindi.\n“I was worried since this was a bidding with another nation, but this turned out well. It would have been easier with weapons.”\n“Right. This is the time to show the power of Chakras to the Ministry of National Defense.”\nThey were confident in their power.\nThe best of the Rao clan.\nEven in the old India, they always welcomed such kinds of situations.\n“We, the Rao clan, accept the proposal.”\nThey accepted the offer.\nAt that, Ahn Woo-hong looked at Chun Yeowun.\nAt that moment, Mak Woo-cheong’s voice entered Chun Yeowun’s head.\n[Benefactor. They aren’t normal people. It was said that the one called Sura had the power to destroy a small mountain with a punch.]\nChun Yeowun looked at the one called Sura.\nAs Mak Wu-cheong said, he knew that these people weren’t ordinary ones.\n‘They are different.’\nThe aura emanating from him was different from qi.\nAnd Chun Yeowun couldn’t guess what kind of energy it was, but the flowing energy was like an overflowing river.\nHe was interested in them.\n“Sounds good. Should we change the location?”\nAfter all, there was only one option to get the Ministry of National Defense to agree with him.\nAhn Woo-hong, who heard the approval from both sides, had them move to a wide field across the road.\nAnd the military was looking at the field from the corner.\nAs they faced each other at a 10 meters distance, Ashri asked Sura.\n“What should we do? Should I go first?”\nAs Sura was about to nod and agree, Chun Yeowun said.\n“If you want to hold out even a little, both of you would have to attack at the same time.”\nIn Hindi.\nComparable with the fluency of a native speaker.\nThe two of them were shocked for a moment and then soon asked Chun Yeowun.\nSura was the one who spoke.\n“I didn’t know you could speak our language. However, we are the warriors of the Rao clan, and we do not attempt such cowardly means, unless in a real war.”\n“Do as you like.”\nWith those words, Chun Yeowun leaned back.\nAhri Rao began to think that Chun yeowun was an arrogant jerk.\nAlthough they were being polite because this could be a turning point for their clan, they were also warriors.\n“Crude and stupid. I once tried to show the power of the Chakras to the Murims, and it was good. I’ll break that arrogant nose of his.”\nAshri stepped forward.\nAnd took a pose similar to meditation.\nWoong!\nAt that moment, the energy around him surged.\nThe sand on the floor was pushed away like a whirlwind.\n‘Hmm.’\nChun Yeowun’s eyes narrowed.\nIn Chun Yeowun’s eyes, who could see the flow of energy, the energy inside Ashri’s body was concentrated in several parts.\nThe neck, the Dantian, blood vessels, the muscles.\n‘Unique.’\n.\n‘And the energy is explosively strong.’\nThey surely had a reason to be confident in themselves.\nHis energy was surely enough to push a warrior gasping for air.\n“Hmph!”\nOnce that was done, Ashri’s body was covered in blue light.\nIt was like using self-defense energy, but this was different too, it was similar to energy being condensed.\nAshri Rao spoke to Chun Yeowun.\n“It’ll be better for you to start. Otherwise…. Hmph!”\nHe slammed his fist towards the floor.\nKwaang!\nAt that moment, with a loud roar, the floor around collapsed and created a huge 10 meters low pit.\nAnd the pit stopped right near Chun Yeowun’s feet.\n“Oh oh.”\nAn exclamation came out of Ahn Woo-hong’s mouth who watched it.\nHe was surprised.\nAshri lifted his head like a happy puppy and looked at Chun Yeowun.\n‘Huh?’\nHowever, Chun Yeowun didn’t seem that shocked or even surprised.\nHe thought this much pressure would be enough before entering the battle, but this only brought insult to Ahsri’s feelings.\n“What a cheeky man! I will punch that nose in right now.”\nPhat!\nAshri moved towards Chun Yeowun.\nHis body bounced up like a spring and reached Chun Yeowun’s face.\n“Hmph!”\nAshri kicked Chun Yeowun’s head. His kick had a blue light shining.\nSwoosh!\n‘You brought this on yourself.’\nRao was going to blow off Chun Yeowun’s head.\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun lifted one hand up.\n‘Well then.’\nOf course, Ashri thought that the opponent would have to block it.\nHowever, the place where Chun Yeowun’s hand went was the forehead.\nWith the index and thumb curled.\n‘Forehead flick? Is this a joke now?’\nIt was then.\nThe moment Chun Yeowun’s finger hit the forehead.\nBam!\n“Kuak!”\nTremendous force pierced his forehead, and Ashri bounced back with a scream.\nKwakwakwang!\nHe was smashed down and bounced several times.\nHe only stopped after falling 20 meters away.\nBlood was dripping from his forehead, and he staggered a little before losing consciousness.\n“No way…”\nSura couldn’t stay silent at the unexpected results.\nChun Yeowun said.\n“I told you two to come at once.”",

      "content": "Chapter 104: Chakra (2)\nAll the soldiers who were watching the scene were amazed.\nIt was the same with Ahn Woo-hong.\nFor those not familiar with martial arts, it seemed like Ashri was thrown away the moment he ran towards Chun Yeowun.\n‘What happened? Suddenly Ashri Rao is lik…’\nAshri Rao's face was covered in blood. And looking at the man, they knew that he wasn’t in a good condition.\nSura’s expression hardened.\n‘Ashri is a great warrior candidate who even opened his 5th Chakra. Defeating him with just one move.’\nRao warriors learned the energy of Chakras. The warriors of old India like the Rao clan received the energy in the infinite universe and swirled it into their bodies.\nThose who mastered Chakras were like superhumans.\n‘If the 5th Chakra is opened, the warriors should be the easiest to defeat.’\nTheir confidence shattered.\nChun Yeowun seemed to turn around.\nThe match wasn’t even over yet, and the man was walking towards the restaurant, so Sura shouted.\n“What are you doing?”\n‘They are strong. But the results are clear.’\nAshri Rao was in a situation in which standing up seemed great.\nIt seemed like he would collapse if anyone touched him.\nAnd the winner was clear.\nFor Chun Yeowun, the match was done.\nGrunt!\nSura clenched his teeth and shouted.\n“Ashriii!!!”\nLike the roar of a tiger, his shout spread in all directions.\nSoldiers more than 200 meters away covered their ears.\n“Gasp!”\nAshri’s eyes, which were dazed, turned dark.\nIt was as if his soul was out of his body.\nHe suffered a blow to his forehead and had a concussion.\n‘I… what did I do?’\nHe remembered Chun Yeowun hitting him on the forehead.\nWhen he looked up, he was far away from Chun Yeowun.\n“Ashri! Have you forgotten our mission!”\n“G-Great warrior!”\nAshri bit his lip at the cry.\nHe had to win this battle.\n‘For the nation!’\nThey had to save the old India, which was ruined.\n“Ahhhh!”\nAshri exhaled and then tried to clear his mind.\nHe thought that if he was mentally strong, he could overcome the situation.\nBut.\n“Uh?”\nHe tried to take just one step, and the ground was right in front of his eyes.\nThud!\n‘M-My body isn’t moving.’\nAhsri Rao’s body fell while trembling.\nAn energy completely different from the Chakras was inside his body, and he wasn’t able to push that energy out.\nHe tried to move again, but nothing happened.\n“Ashri!”\n“Great…. Great… warri… my body…”\n“Get up! Is that the spirit of the Great Rao clan?”\nSura urged him to get up with a voice mixed with anger.\nChun Yeowun shook his head and spoke to Sura.\n“He won’t be able to move for the rest of his life if he doesn’t relief the energy buried in the body.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, Ashri Rao’s face turned pale.\nEven though he wanted to throw out this unknown energy, he couldn’t use the Chakra.\n“What?”\nSura ran to Ashri who collapsed.\nAnd then checked his condition.\nGlaring at Chun Yeowun, Sura asked.\n“What did you do?”\nInstead of answering, Chun Yeowun asked him.\n“The method of gathering energy might be different, but you must know that when someone else’s energy enters you, it destroys the organs, right?”\n“This is organ destruction?”\nSura stepped aside and looked at Ashri.\nThe veins were popping up on his body.\n‘Huh?’\nChun Yeowun frowned.\nWhat he did was supposed to cause an internal injury, but looking at this, it seemed like the flow of energy had been reversed.\nShh!\n“Uh?”\nChun Yeowun suddenly appeared in front of them.\n‘He is fast!’\nSura looked at Chun Yeowun in bewilderment.\nHe didn’t like how this man was better than them despite not utilizing Chakras.\n“Stand back.”\nSura turned away with a dissatisfied expression.\nChun Yeowun looked at Ashri’s pulse.\nIt was to find out what kind of influence was exercised on the body.\n‘This…’\nChun Yeowun’s eyes shone.\nHe assumed that this was something like an adverse effect on his opponent.\nBut he was wrong.\n‘His energy is absorbing the energy I induced into the body.’\nA unique thing.\nThe properties of their internal energy were different.\nDespite that, it was absorbing an energy different from theirs.\n‘It is absorbing… but, maybe the body is overloaded because I used too much? Is that it?’\nIt was confusing.\nUsually, the absorption of energy happens when one’s level is higher. Like how the Sky Demon Energy absorbs the other energies.\n“Do you know what is happening?”\nSura asked in a worried tone.\nInstead of answering, Chun Yeowun asked again.\n“Are the five energies in this one’s body the thing called Chakra?”\n“Y-yes.”\n“What is this energy.”\nSura’s eyes narrowed at that.\nJust as how it was forbidden in the Murim to ask about the martial arts of other clans, it was also rude to ask warriors of India how their Chakras operate.\n“… What are you trying to ask now?”\n“I am asking the definition of this energy called Chakra.”\nWhat Chun yeowun was curious about was what kind of energy the Chakra was.\n‘Even if I don’t have the Sky Demon Energy, I can absorb the other energies of nature.’\nThat was something he could do after reaching the Heavenly master level.\nAnd if he hadn’t reached that state, Chun Yeowun wouldn’t be able to accept a foreign energy into his body.\nRather, it would harm the body to even try.\n“That… Do you think I will tell? The vision of our clan.”\nChun Yeowun smiled at those words.\nAnd then walked away.\n“Well, if that is the case, there is nothing I can do. The match is over too.”\nIt didn’t matter if the other person died or not.\nIt was at that moment.\nBang!\nA loud sound from behind\nChun Yeowun turned his head.\nSura was giving out intense energy.\n“Did you think you could just leave!”\nLooking at his expression, it seemed like he would rush in right away.\nSeeing that, Chun Yeowun spoke coldly.\n“Don’t tell me that you weren’t prepared to die despite jumping into a battle?”\nAshri Rao had rushed forward wanting to kill Chun Yeowun too.\nIt was natural that when there was a battle, both sides would enter knowing that they could die at any point in time.\nGrunt!\nSura clenched his teeth.\n“… I admit it. This victory is yours. We, the Rao clan, never feel ashamed for losing our lives in a fair fight.”\n“Really? Then… your current actions?”\nLife and Chakras were intertwined, and it was similar to the wind blowing in all directions.\nSura spoke.\n“Compete with me this time.”\n“Compete?”\n“I, the great warrior of the Rao clan, challenge you.”\n“Not interested.”\nChun Yeowun ignored him and moved away.\nAt that, Sura quickly moved in front of Chun Yeowun.\nAnd looked with bitter looking eyes.\n“You aren’t afraid of me right?”\nA deliberate provocation.\nAt that, Chun yeowun smiled.\n“If I was afraid, I would have put my tail…”\nGrab!\nChun Yeowun placed his hand on Sura’s shoulder.\nSura was about to slap it away, but then it felt like his body was being stopped.\n“Ugh!”\nKwakwakwa!\nSlowly, his legs began to dig into the ground, till his waist.\nIt happened so quickly that he couldn’t even open the Chakras.\nChun Yeowun looked down at him and said,\n“Don’t use strong words. They will only make you look weaker.”\n“Thi… this…”\nChun Yeowun shook his head and began to walk away.\nGoo!\nAt that moment, a bright light shone from Sura’s body.\nAt first it was red, then it turned yellow, green and then blue like Ashri, and then purple.\nAnd finally, the whole body was dyed in white light at last.\nFlash!\nThe ground around Sura melted.\nShaking as if something was moving.\nRumble!\nChun Yeowun stopped.\nThis was unique.\nEnergy was resonating from Sura.\nHowever, it is completely different from the energy in nature.\nChun Yeowun turned his head.\n‘The energy around is condensed. It whirled and then was sucked in.’\nLike an abyss.\nChun Yeowun was interested as he had never seen such a thing before.\nSura spoke to Chun Yeoun.\n“Condition. You win and I will tell you about the Chakras.”\n“You don’t know when to give up.”\n“And if I win, give up the bid and treat Ashri’s condition.”\nThat was Sura’s true purpose.\nChun Yeowun knew this was absurd.\n“I don’t see why I should go along with this.”\n“I think you must think this is easy because it is a vision of the clan, but this is a vision of Timur the Conqueror, who was famous in the myth for attaining invincibility a long while ago.”\n‘Timur?’\nChun Yeowun heard nothing about it.\nSo Nano explained it to him.\n[Amir Timur, a conqueror who rose in Samarkand.]\nAmir Timur, the ruler of Timur Empire.\nThe conqueror of Central Asia, Afghanistan, Russia Northern India and even the Anatolian Peninsula. The Jianghu is the last place he tried to conquer to turn into the greatest emperor, but he failed.\nIf it wasn’t for someone killing him in his barracks, it was said that he would have controlled China.\n[He is said to be the strongest warrior in the Timur Empire.]\n‘Stronger warrior?’\nChun Yeowun looked at Sura.\nThe source of the energy, he understood it to some extent now.\nThe Rao clan was one of the two clans who succeeded in following the Chakra vision of Timur.\nChun Yeowun asked.\n“You don’t seem to be worried about losing your vision.”\n“I am not! I am the great warrior of our clan. The warrior who conquered the 10th Chakra of Timur. There is no defeat.”\nHaving opened the seven Chakras, his confidence was overflowing.\nIt wasn’t just a rumour that he took down a mountain.\nChun Yeowun looked at him and said.\n“The balance isn’t right.”\n“What?”\nHe was using the vision of a great person, what balance was he talking about?\nChun Yeowun looked at the man once again and said.\n“Not just the vision of Chakras, but the loyalty of the Rao clan.”\n‘!!!’\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, the expression on Sura’s face twisted.\nIt was absurd to ask for them to swear allegiance to another clan.\n“Y-You really!”\nAs he was about to get angry, Chun Yeowun said.\n“You aren’t in a position to argue. I am accepting the match despite winning the bid here, can’t you even do that?”\nSura clenched his fists.\nChun Yeowun was the kind to get what he wanted.\nWhen Sura realized that everything depended on him, his shoulders felt heavy.\n‘Right. I should win. I am the strongest warrior of the Rao clan. I can’t be taken down by a Murim warrior.’\nAfter making up his mind, Sura said.\n“Fine! I hope you keep your promise.”\nAt that decision, Chun Yeowun smiled.",

      "content": "Chapter 105: Chakra (3)\n“What are they doing?”\n“W-well?”\nAt Ahn Woo-hong’s question, Mak Wu-cheong titled his head.\nIt seemed like the confrontation had ended, but Sura Rao was suddenly acting furiously, and then the two people talked.\nAhn Woo-hong mumbled.\n“It seems like one side doesn’t understand.”\nHe thought that he should intervene.\nIt was the moment when he was about to ask a soldier to go.\nSura suddenly went for Chun Yeowun.\nThe moment he raised his fist.\nA bright light formed into the shape of a giant fist and stretched forward.\nThe ground which was below him tore apart.\nPang!\n“Ack!”\nThe aftermath hit the soldiers and even Ahn Woo-hong, who was far away.\nDue to the sudden wave of energy, their bodies almost flew away.\n“Ch-chief! Everyone should back off.”\nEven though they were pretty far, because of the aftermath that hit them, the assistant of Ahn Woo-hong gave the orders to move away.\nMeanwhile, Sura, who released the fist, looked at the place, hoping for the dust to die down.\n‘I felt like I hit him.’\nBut it wasn’t a good hit.\nAnd then the gust of wind stopped and the dust fell.\nIn the middle of the place was Chun Yeowun.\n“That was good.”\nSaid Chun Yeowun as he was brushing off the dust.\nHe truly admired Sura’s blow.\n‘Almost as good as East Challenger God.’\nA blow that had reached the highest level of unification.\nEast challenger God.\nOne of the Five Great Warriors in Chun Yeowun’s era. He was known to be the strongest of the Five, and he was one of the few warriors who could stand against Chun Yeowun.\nHowever, the abilities of the current Chun Yeowun weren’t comparable to back then.\n‘After completing the 7th Chakra, I wondered if there was anyone else other than the great warrior of the Amir clan who could receive my attack.’\nSura’s eyes turned alert at the sight of Chun Yeowun being unscarred.\nAfter that, he unfolded a unique movement.\nSure moved his arms in a circular motion, like a qi gathering movement, and then suddenly, countless hands stretched out.\nThey were like images, but not illusions.\n‘Shiva form Chakra.’\nThe several hands, which increased to a dozen, were glowing.\nAnd all the hands stretched out, aiming to hit Chun Yeowun.\nIn a confident voice, Sura declared.\n“I will show you the power of Shiva.”\n“If it is you, then I guess you can stop this.”\n“What?”\nChun Yeowun raised his hand.\nA sudden chill on the skin, and then Ice Swords appeared all around.\nCrackle!\nSura’s eyes widened as he looked at the hundred Ice Swords.\nEven Ahn Woo-hong was shocked.\n‘W-what the…’\nHe couldn’t put it into words.\nThis was completely different from what he knew about the Murims.\n“Stop this.”\nChun Yeowun stretched out his hand towards the shocked Sura.\nThe hundred swords soon rushed towards him at once.\nSwoosh!\nThe power of Sky Flash being concentrated on one person for the first time.\nIf Sura couldn’t think of something, then it was definite that he would die miserably.\n“Ahhh!”\nAt that moment, Sura crossed his arms.\nAnd the space around distorted as the energy around was sucked in like an abyss again.\nPhat! Phat!\nAnd then it happened.\nThe Ice Swords, which were rushing for Sura, didn’t reach him.\nThey began to bend, and then were absorbed into the distorted space.\n‘He sucked in sword energy too.’\nIt wasn’t Sura who absorbed it.\nIt was the distorted space that sucked it.\nSura exhaled and took a deep breath, it was as if he wasn’t sure whether he could stop the attack.\n“The Vishnu form can stop any attack.”\nVishnu.\nOne of the three major gods of Hindu.\nIt had the meaning that ‘permeate everything’ and it was a power suited to defend against such attacks..\nThis filled Sura with a bit of confidence.\n“Now it is my turn!”\nSura’s form bounced and reached for Chun Yeowun.\nWhen he drew a circle with his hands, the Vishnu form Chakra appeared, and numerous huge hands shone trying to suppress Chun Yeowun.\nThe sight was frightening, but.\n“This is fun.”\nChun Yeowun raised his hand with a curious expression.\nWoong!\nAnd the energy of nature around condensed to create an invisible film.\nIt was because he knew that this attack couldn’t be blocked by internal energy.\nBang! Bang! Bang!\nThe hands were blocked.\nThey kept coming as if they wanted to break the film down, but since it was made by the energy of nature, it wasn't an easy thing.\n‘Kumar form!’\nPhat!\nNot wanting to lose the lead on attack, Sura reached for Chun Yeowun with a kick.\nThe Kumar form is a close combat technique.\nShh!\nChun Yeowun pretended to grab something in the air.\nSuddenly, a vague hazy form similar to a sword appeared.\nChun Yeowun blocked the kick with an invisible sword.\nClang!\nThe hit bounced off, giving sparks all over the area.\nChachacha!\nThe floor on either side of Chun Yeowun tore down and cracked.\nAll because of the force at which the Chakra kick came in.\n“Shit!”\nSura turned and kicked Chun Yeowun in succession.\nThe kicks, which kept flying in, were quite hard to unfold.\nChun Yeowun avoided it by moving back.\nPapapak!\nKwakwakwang!\nThe ground touched by Sura’s kick would always get dug into holes.\nIt was a deadly skill.\nChun Yeowun continued to dodge, which made Sura yell.\n“How long do you plan on running away! Do it right!”\nSura changed his stance from kicking, and tried to catch up with Chun Yeowun.\n“I told you not to run!”\nSura used the blow he showed Chun Yeowun previously again.\nThe fist of light, which moved with two circles.\n‘Ah, Indra form!’\nHe intended to increase the destructive power by activating another form, a way to use two Chakras at the same time.\nIndra meant strength.\n“Fine. You want to fight, right?”\nChun yeowun stopped moving back and then took a solid step.\nBang!\nThe floor below cracked.\nIn that state, Chun Yeowun clenched his fists strongly.\nPang!\nThe moment he made that motion, the space around Chun Yeowun shook.\n‘The space is shaking?’\nSura’s eyes frowned.\nGreat energy was condensing into one point enough to shake the space.\nThis was unification, a skill of East Challenger God.\nAnd then he pushed his fist forward.\nBang!\nThe two fists of Sura and Chun yeowun collided at the same time.\nThe force was so huge at the collision, that it seemed like a destructive force.\nKwakwakwang!\nIn an instant, a strong wave spread out like a storm.\nThe waves were so strong that an abandoned gas station and a shabby restaurant on the other side weren’t able to withstand it and collapsed.\nSwoosh!\n“Ahh!”\n“T-there!”\nThe soldiers, who were using the military vehicles as shields, couldn’t hide their shock.\nThey were all watching this from 20 meters away.\nHowever, the impact was so strong that the vehicles were being pushed away. If their vehicles were any closer, they would have tumbled away.\n‘Is this a fight between humans?’\nAhn Woo-hong was shocked as he looked at the scene from behind a vehicle.\nHe had seen a lot of warriors and people with super powers too, but this fight wasn’t something supposed to happen between humans.\nBoth of them were monsters.\nWhoever would win, Ahn Woo-hong would acknowledge them.\n‘Huh. I guess the world is indeed big. With this we can flatten the noses of the Murim department’s bastards.’\nThinking about that in the midst of the terrifying fight, he didn’t seem like a normal person himself.\nThe aftermath of the collision ceased.\nWhere the two were standing was a huge pit of over 50 meters.\nDrip!\nBlood was dripping from Sura’s lip.\nHe looked at his right hand.\nTremble!\nHis hand couldn’t stop trembling.\n‘It is broken.’\nSince fist was protected by the Chakra, it shouldn't have gotten broken.\nHe could still feel the pain in his wrist and shoulder.\n‘Such a huge cost to pay.’\nIf he was like this, then his opponent had to be in the same situation.\nWith that thought, Sura looked up.\nOnly to be shocked.\nChun Yeowun was casually walking towards him.\nPhat! Phat!\nSo leisurely that even the sound of footsteps couldn’t even be heard.\nNot a single wound.\n‘He endured my fist which can break the mountains?’\nNot just that.\nHe injured Sura too.\n‘Then, I, the best warrior of the Rao clan, who mastered the Chakra of Timur, was pushed back by a Murim in China?’\nIt was unbelievable.\nHis mentor had called the Timur Chakras the greatest ever.\nHe was told that no one could handle the seven Chakras.\nBut that was wrong.\nClench!\nSura clenched his teeth in anger.\nChun Yeowun asked him.\n“Do you see the difference in skills now?”\n“Skills?”\n“If you don’t want to get more hurt, admit defeat.”\nChun Yeowun had already thought about taking Sura as his subordinate and didn’t want to inflict more injuries to him.\nHowever, that only angered Sura.\n“Are… you insulting me?”\n“What insult?”\n“Our confrontation is a battle in which the revival of our nation and honor of our clan is at stake. In such a battle, you look so relaxed and say such stuff!”\nBang!’\nSura stepped ahead in anger.\nHe was the kind to accept defeat when the battle was fair.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun wasn’t even doing his best, it was nothing but a disgrace to him as warrior.\nSura crossed his arms and said.\n“Do your best. I am not broken yet!”\nHe had Vishnu Chakra, the absolute defense.\n“Best huh…”\n“If you want to defeat me, then convince me.”\nSura said out loud.\nChun Yeowun looked at him coldly.\n“If I do my best, you will die for sure. You won’t regret it then?”\nSura laughed out arrogantly at those remarks.\n“Hahaha!”\nAnd then he smiled.\n“Huh! Say something like that after you break down the Vishnu form.”\nThe Vishnu form was something where the Timur Chakra were concentrated.\nAnd this was the Chakra which brought invincible reputation to Timur, the absolute defense which no one could break.\n“Ahhh!”\nAs Sura raised his energy, a tornado swirled around him and once again the energy began to get absorbed.\nAn abyss that could suck in endless energy.\nChun Yeowun shook his head and said.\n“Don’t complain once you are dead.”\n“Huh! That kind of talk about Vishnu…”\nThat moment, a black energy surged from Chun Yeowun’s body.\nDark like an abyss.\nThe darkness was present till the tip of the sword.\n‘What the hell?’\nAs Sura looked puzzled, an unbelievable thing happened.\nSlash!\nThe sound of something being cut.\nAt the same time, the strong rise in energy around.\n‘Huh?’\nA black line drawn in the air.\nSura’s eyes widened as if they were about to explode.\nHe couldn’t believe what he was witnessing.\nSwoosh!\nA sound which made him feel like his eardrums would tear.\nAs a space appeared in the black line, the space around Sura cracked and the Vishnu Chakra which had to be strong like an iron wall, was cut.\n‘H… he cut it?’\nCreepy!\nIt didn’t end there.\nThe black line was about to reach him.\nIn that brief moment, in Sura’s mind, he saw himself be split in two.\n“Ahhh!”\nIn fear, he screamed.\nTap!\nAnd then something hit the back of his head.\nWhen Sura opened his eyes, he was lying on the floor.\nThe pain at the back of his head was still there.\n‘What… just what happened?’\nHe looked at his lower body in shock.\nFortunately, he was still in one piece.\nGetting up, he looked at Chun Yeowun in confusion.\nChun Yeowun was pretending to hold something in his left hand, like sheathing a sword.\n‘Did he knock me down?’\nRight.\nChun Yeowun knocked him down.\nHad it been a little late, his body would have been cut in two.\nSura was at a loss for words.\n‘What did he deal…?’\nCutting through space meant that there was nothing that the sword couldn’t cut.\nThe first time for him to be so close to death.\n“W-what the hell was that sword?”\nIt was definitely a sword.\nHe clearly felt the presence of the sword.\n“Supreme Sky Demon Sword.”\n“Supreme Sky Demon Sword?”\n“That is my power.”\nA sword that had the power to destroy everything.\nThe Supreme Sky Demon Sword.\nSomething that no one other than the first Chun Ma and the second Chun Ma knew about.\n‘This… this one isn’t a human. He is the second coming of a god!’\nSura felt a thrill run down his body.\nTremble!\nSura felt his body tremble in awe, and immediately knelt on the floor and said.\n“Sura Rao, the Great Warrior of the Rao clan, serves the Lord!”\nHe admitted defeat.",

However, the government still depended on paper documents.\nIt was to accurately record the documents.\nPyeon Seorim, Ahn Woo-hong’s assistant, had two documents with a special seal on them.\n“Here it is.”\nHe handed the file to Chun Yeowun.\nChun Yeowun, who won the match, was able to smoothly conclude the agreement with the Ministry of National Defense.\nAnd it took only a little time to get everything done.\n“I think we are in the same boat now.”\nAhn Woo-hong asked for a handshake.\nChun Yeowun, who was unable to adapt to those western greetings, was a bit puzzled before he reached out his hand.\nAnd now, Sky Demon Order officially was in an alliance with the National Defense.\n“It would be nice to have a meaningful and open conversation with a partner.”\n“Chief.”\nAt those words, the assistant shook her head.\nTap!\n“We don’t have time for that, it seems, I’ll make sure to have an opening in the schedule next time.”\nAhn Woo-hong stood up.\nAs the Minister of National Defense, he didn’t have any breaks.\nSo he walked away while looking at Sura Rao, who had a bitter face.\nBecause he understood this situation.\nHe knew very well that words were no consolation for warriors, and that sympathy was the last thing they’d want.\n‘This is unfortunate. I would like to help if I could.’\nIt was hard to handle two risks at the moment.\nIn a sense, it was more difficult to help the Rao clan in rebuilding their nation.\n‘I hope you can stand tall again.’\nStill, he felt connected with the man, so he prayed for him.\nWhen Ahn Woo-hong left, Sura Rao explained the vision of Timur to Chun Yeowun and then made sure to get Ashri’s condition back to normal.\n“The Chakras originate from mental training. It is the hakra which receives the energy from the vast universe and interacts with the mind and body.”\n“Receiving energy from the universe?”\nChun Yeowun narrowed his eyes.\nHe knew what the universe was with the help of Nano.\nIt was also known that this planet earth was nothing but a speck of dust in the universe.\n‘It is different from martial arts.’\nThe basis of martial arts was breathing.\nReceive the energy in the earth through breathing and build the energy inside the body.\nThat’s cultivation.\n“How do you receive the energy of the universe?”\n“Our human body can be called a microcosm of the universe.”\n“Microcosm?”\n“Like the stars which are around the universe. There are around 88,000 Chakras in the human body. The basis of Chakra comes from feeling the 88,000 Chakras.”\n“What kind of feeling?”\n“The teacher makes the successor feel them.”\nChun yeowun nodded his head.\nIt was similar to how a master teaches martial arts to his disciple by infusing energy into the Dantian.\nHowever, 88,000 Chakras were too many.\n“Are there people who have learned all of them?”\n“Only one in a hundred passes through the 1st stage and feels it. It takes 3 to 5 years for even the most talented.”\nThat was why Chakras were taught from a young age.\nThe process of memorizing all the 88,000 is complex.\n‘Hmm.’\nWhen it comes to techniques in martial arts, one only learns what their clan teaches.\nUltimately, this was because their techniques go well with their cultivation techniques.\n“And those who pass the first stage would be able to unlock the Root-Chakra.”\nIt was said that once the Root-Chakra was opened, nothing could be blocked.\nAnd when all the impurities in the body would be discharged, the second Chakra, the Sacral-Chakra, would open, and then power would be used in earnest.\n‘Dantian.’\nThe second for martial arts was Dantian.\nIt was similar to developing a Dantian and earnestly utilizing it.\n“Up to this point, all the warriors of the Rao clan have learned the basics. However, the third stage, the Solar Plexus-Chakra, could only be mastered by the elected.”\nThose who mastered the Solar Plexus were said to be apple to release the Chakra outside the body.\nWoong!\nSura showed it.\nWith just the third Chakra, he was able to shine a yellow light.\nIt was like a freely flying flag.\n“The fourth is the Heart-chakra, it amplifies the energy.”\nWhen the fifth, the Throat-Chakra, is opened, they reach a stage where they can utilize the Chakras of the whole body as one, and only then would they be called Chakra users.\nThe sixth is the Third Eye-chakra, one will gain an excellent intuition other than eyes and ears and be able to read the truth in others.\n“You would then be called a Chakra expert. And when you open the last Crown chakra…”\nIt is possible to draw power from the universe through spiritual communication.\nAnd then one would be called Chakra Master, one who openly communicates with the universe.\nTimur the Great was able to become a king because he was a Chakra master.\n‘Hmm.’\nUpon hearing that, Chun Yeowun had a strange feeling that the Chakras were the same as internal energy.\nThe start and end were different, but the process was the same.\n‘To communicate with the universe…’\nAccording to Sura’s words, the Chakras aim for realization and communication with the energy of the universe.\nHowever, in the process, beyond depending on the surrounding nature, they boldly were connected with the universe.\n“I want to know how to operate the Chakras.”\n“Operation is…’\n“I cannot improve Ashri’s condition without knowing it.”\nSura, who heard those words, put his hands together and prayed.\nAlthough he wasn’t saying anything, it felt like a prayer of self-reflection for letting someone other than the clan members know about the vision.\nBut a promise is a promise.\n“Are you going to master Chakras?”\n“Well.”\nJust by looking at Ashri’s condition, it was impossible to know how Chakras would handle internal energy.\n“For now, start using Chakra.”\n“Huh?”\n“I will check it through your body.”\nSura’s face showed he couldn’t understand it.\nIf he couldn’t infuse the Chakras into the 88,000 points, then mastering them would be impossible for Chun Yeowun.\n‘This has to be a waste of time.’\nSura looked at Ashri.\nThe man was sweating and the blood vessels were still bulging, he didn’t look good.\n“Will this help?”\n“If you do it.”\n“…”\nIn the end, Sura opened up the Chakras in order.\nTo unlock the first, he had to go through the process of connecting all 88,000 Chakras in the body.\nAnd then, Chun Yeowun reached for his body.\nA red light shining on his palm.\n“What do you plan on doing?”\n“Don’t mind me and continue. Slower than normal.”\nHe didn’t know the reason, but Sura decided to continue.\nAs an accomplished Chakra master, he was able to control them right away, but did it slowly since he was asked to.\nShh!\nHe didn’t know, but Chun Yeowun’s eyes were trembling.\nNano was scanning his body, each change in the body and each point of Chakra.\nAnd this was possible because Chakra is also some kind of energy.\n‘Is this what it is?’\nChun Yeowun who looked at the scans was shocked.\nThe circulation of energy without leaving a single blood point, now he understood why this took time to learn.\n‘… with cultivation it might be possible.’\nAlthough the energies were different, it wouldn't hurt to try.\nChun Yeowun, who was now a Heavenly Master, already learnt all kinds of cultivations.\n“Phew.”\nHe controlled his breathing and operated his internal energy.\nIt wasn’t difficult to follow the order which Sura showed.\nWoong!\nAnd when he operated the 88,000 points called Chakras, surprisingly, energy was forming.\n‘Ah!’\nWhat was even more shocking was that the energy had changed.\nIt was completely different from the internal energy he had generated so far, it has become similar to Chakra energy.\nSura’s whole body flowed orange, and his energy slowly died.\n‘Bottom level.’\nThe Dantian of Chun Yeowun, which had adapted to the Heavenly Master, was divided into three parts.\nIt was focused on the top, middle and Dantian, he followed the order in which Sura opened the points.\nWoong!\nAnd at some point in the opening, Chun Yeowun’s body began to shine.\nIt went straight from red to orange, yellow and then green.\n‘W-what!’\nSura’s eyes, which were checking the man, went wide.\nIf his eyes weren’t wrong, then Chun Yeowun just managed to open the 4th stage.\n“H-How did you?”\n“Keep going.”\nIt was called Going Against the Flow of the Energy.\nChun Yeowun had already been through this once, and was far higher than Sura.\nConfused, Sura opened the 5th stage.\n‘I see.’\nChun Yeowun was immediately able to grasp how it was done.\nA blue light shone from Chun Yeowun’s body.\nThe same indication of opening the fifth Chakra.\n‘… No way.’\nSura couldn’t hide his shock.\nHe couldn’t quite understand what was happening right in front of his eyes.\n‘Chakras can't be learnt this easily.’\nHe had no idea how this man was doing it.\nAnd then something went wrong.\n‘From the 6th Chakra, it won't open unless one acquires the 7th sense intuition.’\nSura thought that Chun Yeowun wouldn’t be able to do that.\nSura opened the 7th sense and then opened the 6th Chakra. And his body glowed purple.\n‘Blood\n.’\nChun Yeowun moved the new energy which came from opening the Chakras into the blood.\nWhen the energy was placed there, Chun Yeowun felt as if he was liberated like a bird.\n‘What? This is…’\nAn unknown energy.\nThis was different from the energy of nature.\n‘What is this?’\nThis energy seemed infinite and endless.\nChun Yeowun’s eyes were dyed black.\nLights twinkled as if countless stars were being drawn on his eyes.\n“Ahhh…”\nAt some point, Chun Yeowun went into the world of unconsciousness.\nSura, who was seeing the man open the Chakras one after another, couldn’t shut his mouth.\n‘How can this even…’\nSura hadn’t even opened the 7th Chakra yet.\nHowever, the light slowly flowing from Chun Yeowun was consuming the surrounding energy and encroaching it.\n‘He is trying to open the 7th Chakra by himself!’\nSura was stunned.\nHe never heard of such a thing.\nIt was impossible to reproduce the Chakras by listening or feeling them in someone else’s body.\nBecause they wouldn’t know how to operate them.\nShhh!\nThe incandescent light shining from Chun Yeowun turned black.\nHe couldn’t tell if it was black light or pure darkness.\n“Now what is this…”\nIt was something that never happened to him.\nChun Yeowun’s body suddenly was covered in darkness and countless small lights twinkled like stars.\n“Universe?”\nIt was like looking at the huge universe.\n‘… did he just attain a higher enlightenment than me?’\nSeeing such radiant light, Sura was in awe.\nIt was impossible for him to understand this phenomenon, but he was certain that Chun Yeowun had attained enlightenment.\nShhh!\nBefore long, the lights disappeared.\nAnd Chun Yeowun, who was staring into the dark with black eyes, was back to normal.\n“Lord?”\nAt Sura’s call, he sighed.\n“Ahh!”\nAnd then he put on a sad expression.\nHe wanted to see the infinite world a little more, but all he got was a mere peek.\nNow he was just vaguely aware of this new world, and he wanted to grasp it.\nBut even that mere peek felt amazing.\nSh!\nChun Yeowun looked at his hand.\n‘It seems to be there, but not, and it doesn’t seem to be there but can be felt. Even though it is the same, it is infinite too.’\nThis vivid feeling was still in his body.\nIf the energy of nature is the flow around, then this new energy is the truth behind everything.\n‘It was there…’\nChun Yeowun was sure.\nA bigger world beyond the Heavenly Master Level was present.\n“… what did you see?”\nSura asked in a trembling voice.\nAt that, Chun Yeowun went close to Ashri without answering.\nAnd placed his hand over his head.\nWoong!\nA mix of darkness and starlight came from Chun Yeoun’s hand.\nAt that moment, Ashri’s body trembled and the veins began to shrink.\n“Cough!”\nAshri coughed up black blood.\nAnd then fell down with a more relaxed face than before.\n“Ashri!!”\nSura ran to him to check his condition.\nHe was shocked to see that he is now better.\nAnd Ashri’s Chakra was higher than before.\n“How is this possible?”\n“I let the energy of nature enter the Chakra.”\n“H-how is that possible?”\nSura thought that Ashri couldn’t control this new energy as it was different from theirs.\nChun Yeowun smiled and said.\n“It is possible. The energy of nature is also part of the universe.”\n“Universe?”\n“If I am right, this can be done.”\nWith that Chun Yeowun held out his hand in a certain direction.\nThe place where the restaurant had collapsed.\nWoong!\nStrong energy condensed into the air around the restaurant and the space distorted.\nA tornado occurred and the debris was sucked in.\nSwosh!\nA black hole.\nIt happened in an instant.\n“It works.”\nChun Yeowun spoke as if it was nothing.\nWhen Sura saw it, he went stiff in shock.\nWhat this man just unfolded was the Vishnu form, the 7th Chakra.\nYet different.",

      "content": "Chapter 107: An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth (1)\nXian, the capital of the current Chinese government.\nAll the government agencies were located there.\nNaturally, the State council, the central institution of the government, was also located there.\nBesides, there were three hundred buildings for policy institutions.\nIn front of the Ministry of National Defense building, on the Southwest side of the State Council.\nLike the Ministry of National Defense, the entrance was guarded by military police officers and other officers in various military uniforms.\nAll walking back and forth.\nThere was a middle-aged man standing in front of the building with a dissatisfied face.\nWearing a neat white uniform, he was Jang Pyeong-gak of the Wudang clan.\n“You can't get in without a permission pass, huh.”\nJang Pyeong-gak expressed his frustration to another middle-aged man standing in front of him.\nThe middle-aged man was wearing a fancy luxury suit and sunglasses.\n“I know. Mr. Jang.”\nThe middle-aged man was Tang Moon-su, the vice president of D.A.N.G pharmaceuticals.\nHe is an orthodox descendant of the Tang family.\nWhat was the reason for the two most influential executives of the Murim Association to come here?\n“Why the hell was director Oh so furious?”\n“No idea.”\nThe director they were talking about is Oh Tae-chung, the head of the Ministry of Murim.\nThe two had come to meet Oh Tae-chung and pressure him regarding the Demonic Cult’s movements.\nBut at that time, Oh Tae-chung was absent.\nAll they heard was that he had run over to the Ministry of National Defense in anger.\n“This is hard. The situation seems to be serious.”\nIf Oh Tae-chun was enraged, that meant that something had happened.\nAlthough he was close to the Murim Association, that man was a politician.\nAnd a demanding person.\n“My bones hurt. Why are all these things happening so fast after each other?”\nJang Pyeong-gak was puzzled at Tang Moon-su’s words and asked.\n“What do you mean?”\n“Hmm, I will let you know.”\n“About what?”\n“There seems to be a quarrel within the Moyong company.”\n“Moyong company?”\nJang Pyeong-gak was surprised.\nIt was known that the five great clans' descendants usually came to the Murim Association’s gatherings.\nSo information naturally flowed between them.\n“Since Chairman Moyong fell into a coma, there have been disputes between the two sons over the succession.”\n“Hold on. The Moyong company’s successor was already decided on, right?”\nAs far as he knew, the eldest son and the managing director was the successor.\nHe heard that there was a second son, who was once called a genius, but then the kid suddenly lost his martial arts due to an unknown reason.\n“It seems like the second son was able to regain his martial arts skills.”\n“What? You know that a Dantian could never form again once destroyed, right? How did that happen?”\nJang Pyeong-gak asked.\nHe was there when the chairman Moyong asked him for a favor in therapy.\nHe couldn’t treat the child, so how did that kid regain his martial arts?\n“I don’t know. But the recovered skills aren’t normal… ah! Director!”\nThe conversation stopped.\nIt was because Oh Tae-chung, the head of the Ministry of Murim, came out.\nThe man was at a loss for what to do.\n“Damn it!”\nDespite being in front of another building, he didn’t seem to hide his true feelings.\nThe man was visibly angry.\nTatak!\nThe two people from the association immediately went to him and greeted him.\n“We greet you, director.”\n“Director, this is Jang Pyeong-gak, of the Wudang clan.”\nOh Tae-chung frowned as he looked at them.\nHe just remembered that he had a meeting with them.\nBut more importantly, he was angry.\n“You two. What have you done?”\n“Huh?”\nThe two men were dumbfounded at the ambiguous question.\nIt wasn’t that they didn’t understand, it was more like they couldn’t figure out what he was referring to, so Oh Tae-chung added,\n“What the hell did you do so that the Ministry of National Defense is acting like that!”\n“D-director! We don’t understand what you are talking…”\n“Give it here.”\nOh Tae-chung reached his hand out to the female secretary next to him and then took a hard case file.\nOh tae-chung, who took it, almost threw it at the two.\n“What is this?”\n“That is an official announcement letter from the National Defense.”\n“Announcement?”\nThe two were puzzled and looked at the file.\nHowever, after looking at its content, their expressions turned more stiff.\n“T-this… what the hell!”\nThe contents of the letter stated that the Ministry of National Defense has signed an alliance with the Yongchun Group. If Gate Defense battles were to occur in the future, it would no longer be possible to engage in the battles without the Ministry of National Defense’s permission.\n“W-when did the…. Demonic Cult bastards get this done?”\nIt was like lightning had struck them.\nJag Pyeong-gak was the first to speak.\n“Director! This is absurd! The Yongchun is from the Demonic Cult. Don’t you know?”\n“Who doesn’t know that? What the hell did you people do to make them end up joining hands with the Defense?”\nAt those words, the two couldn’t say anything.\nThey were here to ask the Murim Department to pressure the Cult because half their executives were not present.\n‘Now isn’t the time to judge the right and wrong.’\nThe party judged this situation to be serious.\nNot being able to defend the Gate Defense battles meant that the Murim Association’s core supply and demand was going to be cut off.\nIn addition, the reason the Murim Association affiliated companies have always walked proudly was because they have been contributing to the Defense.\n“Director. We need to stop it right now. If the Demonic Cult and the Defense join hands, it will be a huge blow to both us and the Ministry of Murim.”\nIf the influence of the Ministry of Murim decreased, the position of the association would decrease as well.\nOh Tae-chung spoke to Tang Moon-su with a harsh face.\n“Well we are late!”\n“Uh?”\n“It was already reported to the State Council and passed.”\n‘!!!’\nTang Moon-su and Kang Pyeong-gak’s faces distorted at the same time.\nIf it was passed by the council, it meant that the majority had accepted it.\nAnd there were already many people who didn’t like the Ministry of Murim.\n‘No…’\nThis was the worst.\nNow they found out why Oh Tae-chung was angry.\nPak!\nOh Tae-chung went closer and poked Tang Moon-su’s chest with his fingers as he spoke in a raspy voice.\n“We need to come up with a countermeasure right away! Otherwise, all vested interests in the association will be in vain.”\nThe association who came here to lighten their burden, only received more.\nA holographic meeting in a dark conference room.\nThe present holograms were the executives of the Murim Association.\nEven with ?the loss of the Murim association main office, the meeting could be held.\n-Now that things have become like this, how can the chairman and vice-chairman be absent!\nThe atmosphere was serious.\nIt was because of the shocking news delivered by the two who visited the Ministry of Murim.\nThey had to come up with a solution but the most important people were absent.\nThe chairman was in a closed door training and the vice-chairman was away on a business trip.\n-Where are they in such a frustrating situation?\n-Did you tell them that we were meeting for this situation?\n-Of course, I informed them.\nHowever, the only answer which came back from the Ohshin group was that they couldn’t interfere with their chairman’s closed door training. Despite how critical the situation was.\nThat was what made the other executives burst out in anger.\n-If that’s the case, the meeting cannot proceed. How about changing the chairman for the time being?\n-You are talking about the chairman of the association?\nAt that comment, everyone’s faces darkened.\nThey too felt that someone had to be held accountable.\nHowever, it was quite difficult to bring down the chairman right now.\nThe Ohshin Group boasted the most undeniable power in the current Murim.\n-Mr. Jang. There are 3 years left for the position of chairman, is it possible?\nIt was Hyewon of Emei clan\n-What do you mean? I agree with what Mr. Jang has said. Isn’t the chairman always sending his representative to every meeting since last year? Does it make sense to not attend such a crucial meeting? Is he so busy that he can’t even appear through a hologram?\nNam Gung-oh of the Namgung clan agreed.\nAs the opinions were divided, the meeting proceeded in a way to remove the current chairman.\nIt was then.\nClick!\nThe hologram device at the top seat was activated.\nA middle-aged man with big ears and thick lips appeared.\nWith a fairly unusual face, he was Mun Il-hyang, the chairman of the Ohshin Group and the chairman of the Murim Association.\n-Chairman!\nThe executives who were still fighting were shocked.\nJang Pyeong-gak, who was arguing so strongly till then, went silent.\nPak!\nMu-Il-hyang spoke right away.\n-Mun Il-hyang greets the executives of the Association. It has been a while since I last saw you, and I feel very responsible for this situation.\nIn a nasty voice, Nam Gung-oh said.\n-It is really hard to see your face, chairman.\n-Well I am a warrior you see.\n-What is that supposed to mean?\n-I couldn’t just give up on the newly acquired realization.\nAt those words, everyone went stiff.\nThey thought there would be some improvement in the closed room training, but they didn’t think he would attain some realization.\n‘More?’\n‘How strong is he trying to be?’\nAlthough Mun Il-hyang stopped reporting to the Ministry of Murim, he was the strongest person in Murim.\nEven among the other Five Great Warriors, he was the best.\n-Huh, rather than that, chairman. What should we do with this? It seems like the ministry is shaken to the extent that they aren’t talking with the Association.\nJang Pyeong-gak changed the topic.\nSince this was a hologram, the jealousy couldn’t be seen.\nJealousy of the chairman who was now stronger.\n-Well, it is our Murim Association’s job to prevent the Demonic Cult from growing.\n-What do we do? Right now, even the Ministry of National Defense is taking their side…\n-Well, I just got some information.\nAt Mun Il-hyang’s words, everyone was shocked.\nWhen Mun Il-hyang pressed some buttons, a huge screen shone.\nIt was an underground high speed train.\nUnlike the ordinary ones, this only had five compartments, and they weren’t numbered.\n-This?\n-Train?\nThe executives were not sure about what they were seeing.\nAt that, Mun Il-hyang smiled and said,\n-It is the mobile prison which holds the Demonic Cult’s Lord.\n-Demonic Cult!\nAt those words, the others couldn’t hide their shock.\nMost of the executives knew that Chun Woo-jin, the Lord of Demonic Cult was in some secret prison, but not an underground train.\n-How did you get it?\n-I am in charge of guarding the mobile prison at the request of the prosecutor's office.\n‘!?’\nThe one in charge of the security!\nThe executives were perplexed at the words of the chairman who just revealed it.\nMun Il-hyang spoke to them.\n-Only me and the bailiff who gave the sentence know about this train. But this morning, a man disappeared.\n-So?\n-It has to be the work of the Cult.\n-Then, we need to stop them right away!\n-Yes. Those Demonic Cult people would try to break him out…ah!\nShocked by the news, the executives started clamoring for the need to stop the Cult, but they then went silent.\nThey were all looking at each other with the same thought.\nMun Il-hyang smiled and said.\n-Shouldn’t the government and the civilians be shown just how dangerous the Demonic Cult is?\nMain office of Yongchun Group, Jinan city.\nSenior executives including the chairman, chun Yu-jang, couldn’t hold back their joy.\nThe reason was that they managed to find the whereabouts of the Lord Chun Woo-jin, whom they were looking for.\n“Hang Yu-rin. You really worked hard!”\n“It was nothing. Chairman.”\nChun Yu-jang praised the woman.\nBased on the information that the two companies gathered and the information in the hands of the Great Guardian, she managed to find the bailiff who was in charge of the sentence.\nThe bailiff, who was escorted into the Yongchun group, refused to open his mouth and was ready to die.\nHowever, unfortunately, that didn’t happen.\n‘A convenient ability.’\nChun Yeowun made the man a ghost and read his memories.\nThey managed to discover that he was in an underground train.\nHowever, they now had to rescue the man.\n“Finally, we will be able to bring back our Lord!”\nThe executives all rose up and congratulated Chun Yu-jang.\nThere was a sense of haste, still, they knew just how difficult it would be to get their Lord from the prison.\nHu Bong, Marayun and Shakena went to rescue him.\nShakena had her Phasing ability.\nIf the three went in, then it would be an easy task.\n‘Now we are getting closer.’\nEven without Chun Yeowun, there were plenty of talented people.\n“They must have got him by now.”\nHuan Myung-oh said while checking the clock.\nThe underground train would reach Zhugushi at 12 o'clock.\nAccording to the information they got, the train runs non-stop for 12 hours and stops for 20 minutes to shift the workers.\nTing!\nThe smartphone of Huan Myung-oh rang.\nA text flew in.\nHuan Myung-oh, who saw that, went stiff.\n“What is it?”\nAt the chairman’s question, Huan Myung-oh said.\n“I think we should watch TV right away.”\n“TV?”\nHuan Myung-oh hurriedly got up and switched it on.\nAnd the screen shone.\nHe immediately changed it to a new channel which was reporting breaking news while standing in front of the State Council\n-As reported by our correspondent, the judicial authorities of the State Council have decided to proceed with the execution of Chun Woo-jin, the former chairman of the Black Sky Company, at 6 o’clock. He is the worst criminal who caused the bloody death of the president 27 years ago. The perpetrator Chun Woo-jin…\n“W-what is this!”\nChun Yu-jang and the executives who were watching it couldn’t hide their disbelief.\nChun Woo-jin, who was a death row inmate, was given life in prison.\nNow they wanted him executed.\nBesides.\n-This sentence will be carried out in a judicial prison under the State Council in an unusual…\nIt was said that the execution would be carried out by the State Council.\nChun Yeowun narrowed his eyes.\nHe tried various things to make sure people didn’t know about the mission, but it seemed like it was found out, and rather soon.\n‘Too fast.’\nThings were progressing too fast.\nIf this was exposed to the public like this, even if the man was brought out of the prison, people would look at them negatively.\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun heard something.\n-Lord!\nIt was Hu Bong.\nIt was through a nano bomb which was placed inside. Inside whom the nano bomb was placed??\n‘How did it happen?’\nHu Bong spoke in a confused voice.\n-Lord. There are other prisoners here, but not the current Lord.\n‘What?’\nDid that mean that Chun Woo-jin was pulled out?\nSomething felt wrong.\nAccording to the bailiff’s memories, the train would travel in different routes, so there were fixed stops.\nAnd the only stop was the station where Hu Bong was now at, so it was impossible to get the current Lord out.\n‘Do you know if the train has stopped somewhere?’\n-The prisoners say that the train hasn’t stopped in 12 hours.\nAt those words, Chun Yeowun’s brows rose.\n“Ha!”\nChun Yeowun sighed and looked at the State Council building.\nEveryone was puzzled when Chun Yeowun sighed when he said.\n“We were lied to.”\n“Wh-what do you mean…”\nChun Yeowun answered Chun Yu-jang’s question with irritation.\n“The train was fake. The current Lord was never in a mobile prison from the start.”\n“What?”\nAt the same time.\nThe Murim Association meeting.\nMun Il-hyang spoke in a happy voice.\n-They must be out of their minds. There is no Lord in the prison at all. There is no way they can get the man before the execution. Huhuhu.\nThe kidnapped bailiff had the wrong information, so it was no use to torture him and get information.\n-Indeed our chairman!\nThe Murim Association executives were satisfied.\nIt felt like they were having a cool sip of cider in the hot sun.\nTang Moon-su opened his mouth.\n-I think this has limited their options. In order to save their Lord, will they try and rescue him at the cost of being seen badly by the world again? Or boldly let the man die? Haha!\nSuch a plan!\nThey knew that the Cult wasn’t blind to the existence of their Lord.\nAnd if they do something wrong to bring back their Lord, people will remember everything that happened 27 years back.\n-Cool, Public Execution by the State Council.\nThe others acknowledged it too.\nIf they try to bring the man from the judicial prison of the State Council, then the Demonic Cult won’t only get bad complaints from the people but also anger from the government.\nAt that time, Jang Pyeong-gak asked.\n-What if they give up on their Lord?\nMun Il-hyang smiled and said.\n-Huhuhu, don’t worry. One way or another, the next day Demonic Cult will be a felony group trying to free the worst criminal.",

      "content": "Chapter 108: An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth (2)\nConference room of Yongchun Group, Jinan city.\nWhen the executives found out that the prison was fake, they couldn’t contain their anger.\nWho would have imagined that the bailiff was giving them wrong information?\n“We can’t let the Lord be executed!”\n“We need to rescue him now!”\nHuan Myung-oh spoke with a look of resentment.\n“… I understand the sentiment, but this is a clear trap.”\nIt was clearly a trap laid for the Sky Demon Order.\nAnd most importantly, the execution was decided by the State Council.\nThe place where the government stood.\nIf they tried to rescue their Lord out from such a place, the bad relationship with the government would be obvious.\n“But you’re saying we are going to stand by the execution as they want to? He is the Lord! He is the head of the Sky Demon Order.”\nSeohyun, the head of internal inspection, who had a rather aggressive tendency, raised his voice.\nAnd the answer was given by Hang Yu-rin.\n“Calm down. You know that director Huan didn’t mean that.”\n“Haa…”\n“If we rescue our Lord, everyone will believe that what happened in the past was our doing. If that happens, the agreement with the Ministry of National Defense will be broken.”\nWhat the enemies were aiming for is clear.\nIt was to force the government to cancel the agreement.\nThey could ask the Ministry of National Defense to push hard, but if the Cult decided to go in and rescue their Lord, the ministry would receive condemnation from the State Council.\n“How dare they do such tricks!”\nChun Yu-jang was the one who was upset the most.\nHe felt that it was a great disgrace to his father, and the Lord of the Cult, to be executed by the enemies in such a cowardly way.\n“Is that all?”\nChun Yeowun, who was listening to the conversation, spoke for the first time.\nAll eyes were focused on him.\n“What about you?”\nChun Yeowun asked Bi Mak-heon who was next to him.\nThe man opened his mouth holding back his anger.\n“… this isn’t simply a matter of whether we can rescue or not.”\n“What is that now?”\nHuan Myung-oh asked.\n“Their true intentions may lie elsewhere.”\n“True intentions?”\n“Their purpose is to make our Cult shown to the government and public. And it isn’t difficult to sway the public opinion and make it look like we invaded the state council. But it isn’t easy either.”\n“Haa…”\nAt Bi Mak-heon’s words, the executives sighed.\nIn the past, the president’s spilled blood was blamed on their Lord, and that happened because of their foolishness. Even if they don’t rescue their Lord, the result would be the same.\n“Indeed, that was what they aimed for?”\nA dilemma.\nNo matter what choice they made, the Cult would look bad.\n“Is there no other way out?”\nBi Mak-heon shook his head at Chun Yu-jang’s question.\n“… I think we will have to choose the less evil looking option.”\n“Haa…”\nIt means to knowingly head into a trap.\nIf there was no choice but to enter the trap of the enemy, then it would be better to rescue the Lord at all costs.\n“I apologize.”\nWith that, Bi Mak-heon had a hard time finding a solution.\nAfter the Murim Association managed to report the news of execution through news, they will now keep an eye on the Yongchun Group and the Sky Demon Order.\nWhether the cult will come to the State Council or not.\nWhile everyone was shocked, Chun Yeowun spoke.\n“Are you going to move according to the choices the enemy gave us?”\n“Sorry?”\nAll the executives were puzzled. The number of enemies they were dealing with was huge. And they had no choice but to move in the way the enemies had shown them.\n“But ancestor. There is no other way to take. To save the Lord without it affecting the Cult in any wa….”\n“If you are trying to find an answer in the framework they made, there will be no answer.”\n“Then?”\nWith narrowed eyes, Chun Yeowun spoke to Chun Yu-jang and the other executives.\n“Remember, when you are attacked by an enemy, it is common sense to attack back. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.”\nThe execution day of Chun Woo-jin, the former chairman of the Black Sky Company.\nThe execution was blindfold firing, the orthodox Chinese method.\nThanks to the title of mass murderer, all the public attention was focused here.\n2 hours before the execution, inside the Judicial prison in the Judicial building.\nOn the prison’s rooftop, someone was smoking and speaking on the phone.\n“Yes yes. I have placed it as you said.”\nThe man was dressed as the bailiff of the prison while he spoke in a hoarse voice. The name on the badge was ‘Pan Jun-young’.\nLooking at the rank, he seemed to be the deputy of the prison.\n-There was no problem, right?\nA modulated voice through the speaker.\nIt was quite a suspicious voice, but Pan Jun-young answered normally.\n“Most of them were badged as people from the western side, so it doesn’t matter what is planned.”\nBeing able to handle prisoners in the prison meant that it didn’t matter if anyone was killed.\n“Then, when will I have to start it?”\n-The plan will be put to motion in 10 minutes before execution.\n“Alright.”\nClick!\nWith that said, the phone was hung up.\nPan Jun-young mumbled as he wrapped his smartphone onto his wrist.\n“The second blood after the president. The only surviving person in the prison is the deputy.”\nThe best care scenario for him. When that is done, he will be able to get a promotion.\n30 minutes before the execution.\nNumerous military people stood guard around the judicial prison.\nReporters from various media organizations gathered around to cover the news.\nThis was flashy enough to attract the foreign media too.\nThe topic of the execution of the culprit who murdered of the President of China and the Prime Minister of Russia and other senior officials of the nations.\nThe execution room on the first basement floor of the prison.\nAn old man with a prison uniform and a number in red was walking.\nThe old man was Chun Woo-jin.\nHe is the current Lord of the Sky Demon Order and the former chairman of the Black Sky company.\nStep! Step!\nPowerless steps.\nHis eyes, which had been imprisoned for 27 years, were in a state of despair and hopelessness.\nPak!\n“Kuak!”\n“Walk straight! Prisoner 205!”\nOne of the prison guards kicked the man.\nHe used to be a confident man, but being subjected to the same treatment for 27 years, he gave in.\n‘Just a bit more.’\nChun Woo-jin was also longing for his death.\nIn a life full of disgrace, he thought that it would be better for him to die than hold onto his life.\nChun Woo-jin stood in front of the firing squad.\nThe bailiffs tied him up with ropes to keep him from moving.\n“Eyes… you won't cover the eyes?”\nChun Woo-jin asked in a hoarse voice.\nEven if he was on death row, people had their eyes covered in respect to human rights.\nThe bailiff kicked the man and said.\n“Criminals like you can't have wishes. You deserve to die while savoring the pain of death.”\nHe had now to be in pain.\n‘Haa…’\nChun Woo-jin sighed inside.\nHe wasn’t afraid of death, but he wasn’t interested in arguing in the last moments.\nChun Woo-jin looked at the electric clock in the room.\n17:48.\nIn 15 minutes, his damn life would end.\nHe felt sad, but he had no way out.\nSo he quietly closed his eyes and began to memorize the sutras of the Sky Demon Order.\n‘I have no regrets in life or death as this one body is set on fire. Let the light shine on the way I want to do, and joy and sorrow will be all but dust. Pitiful living beings who are troubled.’\nAlthough he brought disgrace to the Sky Demon Order in his time, he only wanted to make sure the new Lord of the Cult would bring light again onto the Cult.\nThere were people watching him through the glass door.\nAlthough they were wearing the clothes of a bailiff, they were unusual for some reason.\nAnd one of them said.\n“You made a surprisingly cold decision. Demonic Cult.”\n“I know right. I thought they would do unreasonable things to save their Lord, but they aren’t idiots I guess.”\n“Well. It wasn’t like we didn’t predict this case.”\nThey were all prepared in case the Cult had appeared here.\nIt was their order to annihilate every single member of the Cult in the judicial prison.\n“I thought I wouldn’t be able to use it, but turns out there was an opportunity right here.”\nThey even learned martial arts from the Demonic Cult.\nFrom here, it was their job to leave traces of the Demonic Cult in the place.\nAnd the time was 17:50.\n“Should we start now?”\nShhh!\nThey took masks out of their pockets and put them on.\nOne of the masked men touched an earpiece and spoke.\n“It’s time.”\n-Click! Roger!\nWheeing!\nAs soon as the answer came, all the CCTVs in the room turned on the red light and went off.\nNot just the CCTVs in the prison, but everywhere around the prison.\nIt was to leave no evidence.\n“Let’s start, shall we?”\nThey opened the glass door and entered the firing range.\nClick!\nThe bailiffs, who were inside, couldn’t hide their shock when masked men came in.\n“W-what! Why are you all wearing masks?”\n“For this reason.”\nPang!\n“Kuak!”\nOne of the bailiffs was shot in the chest by the masked man and pushed away.\nThe bailiff was killed right away.\n“W-why! You bastards!”\nIn a panic, the bailiffs in the range pulled out their guns and aimed theirs at the masked people.\nBut they couldn’t do much since the masked people were warriors.\n“It isn’t even a machine gun, what can you even do! Heheh!”\nPapapah!\nThey opened fire towards the bailiffs.\nThe bailiffs panicked and fired back, but the masked men dodged the bullets and shot them back.\n“Kuak!”\n“Uk!”\nIn an instant, four bailiffs were killed.\n“Wh-what are you doing?”\nThe bailiff , who was standing in front of Chun Woo-jin, couldn’t hide his shock at what happened.\nIt was the same with Chun Woo-jin, but he was shocked for another reason.\n‘It is my Cult’s martial arts!’\nThe martial arts used by the masked people belonged to the Sky Demon Order.\nHe knew the martial arts thoroughly, so he recognized them at a glance.\nEight masked men approached Chun Woo-jin who was tied.\n“Y-You men! You are here to rescue this one!”\nThe only surviving bailiff put his gun at Chun Woo-jin.\nAt that time, Chun Woo-jin bit the man’s hand.\nBite!\n“Kuak! you bastard…”\nHe bit so hard that the flesh ripped off from his hand and the gun fell down.\nThe moment he was about to pick it.\nSlash!\n“Kuak!”\nA sword flew for the bailiff’s head.\nChun Woo-jin spit the flesh out.\n“Huh.”\nThis was the one thing Chun Woo-jin wanted to do before his death.\nHe had been harassed quite a lot by his bailiff.\nThe masked man went to him and said.\nPak!\n“We greet the Lord.”\nThere was a weird sense of playfulness in the eyes of those who greeted him.\nAs they instilled hope, the feelings inside Chun Woo-jin turned more miserable.\nHowever, Chun Woo-jing couldn’t be happy.\n“Masked men. Who might you be?”\nHe inquired about their identity.\nHe wanted to know which clan they were from, so that he would recognize the martial arts of the clan they belonged to.\nThey answered, but Chun Woo-jin said.\n“How dare you try to deceive the eyes of the Lord!”\n“Lord! What are you saying?”\n“I see that you are going to act like this till the end. Huh, did you think that I won’t be able to recognize the clumsy martial arts that don't go with the cultivation method you use?”\nTo their surprise, Chun Woo-jin didn’t buy the fact that they were members of the Cult.\nAlthough they were using the martial arts of the cult, they weren’t using their cultivation method.\nWith his deep knowledge in martial arts, he was able to tell right away that the people only learned the techniques.\n“Shit.”\nThe masked people looked at each other. If they were caught, there was no need to continue with the act.\n‘The CCTV is off anyway.’\nThe masked man, who seemed like the leader, smiled.\n“I was told that he would be rotting, but he still possesses the eyes of the Five Great Warriors.”\n“You men. Are you trying to do the same trick as before?”\nChun Woo-jin hadn’t forgotten what happened 27 years ago.\nThe scene of bloodshed which took place while he was away.\nBy the time he arrived, government officials were executed and the Murim Association accused him for being the culprit.\n“Are you going to frame the Cult by making fake traces this time too?”\nAt Chun Woo-jin’s words, the masked men laughed.\nAnd with a snort, the leader spoke.\n“You are a man who knows that and still is trying to taunt us, I don’t know if you are bold or just lost fear.”\n“Fear? Ha.”\nChun Woo-jin, who realized that he was turning angry, sighed.\nHe wasn’t afraid of death.\n“Do you think I will be afraid?”\n“It is right to be afraid now, Lord of Demonic Cult. Because your usefulness will end as of today.”\nThe masked man approached him with a smile.\nThe man pulled something out of his pocket, a syringe.\nAnd at that moment, Chun Woo-jin knew that it wasn’t a good thing.\n“Huhuh, the Lord of Demonic Cult. I will pay tribute to you, the Lord o f the Demonic Cult, for sacrificing yourself for the sake of justice.”\nWith those words, the man slowly opened the syringe lid and approached Chun Woo-jin.\nTo watch him get afraid.\nAt that time, Chun Woo-jin said something unusual.\n“I don’t know who you are, but I did what you told me to do!”\n“What?”\nIt was then.\nThud!\n“Kuak!”\nSomeone fell from the ceiling of the firing range, and crushed the masked man’s body in a second.\nIt was Chun Yeowun who stood on the corpse of the crushed masked man.",

      "content": "Chapter 109: An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth (3)\n'Ceiling?'\nChun Woo-jin was surprised by the sudden appearance of Chun Yeowun and looked at the ceiling of the firing range.\nExcept through some ventilation fans, there was no way for a person to descend from the ceiling without making gaps.\n'How?'\nHe was puzzled for a moment when he heard the sound.\nAlthough his Dantian was broken, and he couldn't feel anything, this was such an unexpected way for a person to appear.\n'What is he?'\n'Where did he come from?'\nEven the masked people were perplexed.\nIt was ridiculous to believe that their leader was killed by simply being crushed to the floor.\n'A warrior!'\nThey surrounded Chun Yeowun with extreme alert.\nOne of them spoke.\n\"Hahaa! This is it. You must have come to save your Lord.\"\nTo which Chun Yeowun said.\n\"Wrong.\"\n\"What?\"\nShh!\nWhen Chun Yeowun raised his hand, the syringe, which was on the floor, reached his hand.\n\"What is this?\"\nThere was no way that the masked men would answer him.\nOne of them rushed at him with energy gathered on his fist.\n\"As if I would tell you…\"\nShh! Puck!\n\"Kuak!\"\nHowever, the syringe, which was now in Chun Yeowun's hand, was now pierced into the masked man's forehead who approached him.\nFlustered, the masked man tried to pull out the syringe.\nKuaak!\n\"Uh...auh!\"\nHowever, the liquid inside the syringe was injected into the body.\nAt that moment, the masked man's skin was dyed red. The blood vessels bulged out and then burst.\nPsuh! Swoosh!\n\"So that's what it does.\"\nIf they didn't want to answer, he could just find out by himself.\n'This!'\nAnother colleague was easily beaten.\nThat was when the masked men felt how dangerous the situation was. Of course, there were several countermeasures.\n'Turn on the CCTVs!'\nThat was plan B in case the Sky Demon Order sent their men to rescue their Lord.\nAt the gesture of one masked man, the other men rushed towards Chun Yeowun at the same time.\nPapak!\nIn the meantime, the masked man, who made the gesture, touched his earpiece and said.\n\"This is the firing range. Turn on the CCTVs of this room only.\"\nTheir colleagues were scattered all over the prison grounds, including the control room. It wasn't difficult to create a favourable situation.\n-No.\nHowever, a woman's voice answered.\n'!?'\nConfused, The masked man asked.\n\"You… who are you?\"\n-Human, you don't need to know.\nClick!\n\"Kuak!\"\nThe masked man frowned.\nThe problem was that the control room was occupied by an unknown person. He tried to inform his colleague in the prison site about it, and as he tried to switch channels...\n\"Right now…\"\nGrab!\n\"Kuak!\"\nSomeone grabbed him by the neck.\nIt was Chun Yeowun.\n'What the hell are the others doing…. Ah?'\nThe masked man was shocked.\nThe others were lying on the floor like dead birds.\n'Just when?'\nChun Yeowun asked.\n\"You were trying to get in touch with them with this?\"\nChun Yeowun reached for the earpiece the man was wearing.\nThe masked man laughed.\n'Idiot! If you pull it out, it will self-destruct.'\nHowever, the earphone didn't.\n'What?'\nIt was crazy. It had to break once pulled.\n\"Do you think you would be able to rectify the situation by calling your colleagues?\"\nAt Chun Yeowun's question, the masked man tried to answer, enduring the pain.\n\"Kuak… the earphone… they'll get it… kuak… check it soon…\"\nGrab!\n\"Kuak!\"\nChun Yeowun grabbed the neck even harder.\nAnd then he put the earpiece into his ear.\n'Was anyone listening?'\nThe earpiece was connected to various channels of all men within the prison.\nChun Yeowun opened his mouth.\nThe masked man's shock increased.\n\"Ahh. Ahhh. Is this the voice?\"\nTo his surprise, the voice coming from Chun Yeowun's mouth was his own voice.\n'No way!'\nChun Yeowun had the ability to modulate his voice with Nano's help.\nChun Yeowun spoke.\n\"This is the firing range. They showed up, I got them all, but missed two guys. They need to be caught.\"\nIt looked to be some kind of plan, but the masked man couldn't figure it out. Sending a message to his colleagues to search for two members of the Cult. It seemed like a sloppy plan.\n'Why is the radio…'\nHe was puzzled, but Chun Yeowun smiled and said.\n\"If that's the case, no one should escape, right?\"\nThe masked man's eyes widened.\nCome to think of it, if such a message was sent, no one in the site would be able to retreat until those who fled were caught.\n'H-He…'\ng\nChun Yeowun's goal was to get rid of every single one of them.\nWithout hesitating, Chun Yeowun crushed the neck of the man.\nCrack!\n\"Kuak!\"\nChun Yeowun threw the corpse to the floor. And then, he pointed his finger at Chun Woo-jin.\nShhh!\nMiraculously, the ropes around Chun Woo-jin loosened.\n'What amazing power.'\nChun Woo-jin was surprised.\nIt was the first time he had seen a person control their energy like that.\nAt first, he thought that this man was a member of the Cult, but it was his first time seeing such a young face.\n'Well, I got help. That's what matters.'\nIt was right to say thank you.\n\"Thank you for the help.\"\nChun Woo-jin greeted him.\nChun Yeowun clicked his tongue at the sight.\n\"Tch, tch, I was thinking of punishing you, but it would be hard if you act like that.\"\nChun Woo-jin frowned at Chun Yeowun's words. At first glance, it was as if an adult was scolding a child.\n'Calling it Cult means that he has to be someone related to the Cult, but how can he act this rude?'\nHe is the Lord said to be the strongest in the Sky Demon Order. No one in the Cult would utter such words in front of him.\n\"Do you know who you are speaking to?\"\nChun Woo-jin asked politely.\nAfter losing his power for 27 years, he gained patience.\n\"If you are related to the main Cult then…\"\n\"You shared the secret with the Great Guardian, but I guess you aren't very smart.\"\n\"Great Guardian?\"\n'A secret with the Great Guardian?'\nThe secret he shared with the Great Guardian was related to the Sky Demon Order.\nChun Woo-jin's puzzled eyes shot wide.\nMemories flashed through his mind.\n[He may appear in your time according to the prophecy.]\nWas what the former Lord said.\nA secret that was passed down from the 25th Lord of the Cult to each Lord. A Prophecy that each generation was waiting for it.\nHe forgot about it as he was in prison for 27 years.\n\"N-No wa…\"\n\"You are so quick at remembering.\"\nChun Woo-jin's eyes turned red.\nUnable to believe it, he said.\n\"How…. How can this happen…\"\nThe Demon God they heard about in legends was standing right in front of his eyes.\nChun Woo-jin hurriedly fell to the floor.\n\"Chun Woo-jin greets the legend of the Great Sky Demon Ord…\"\nWoong!\nHowever, the energy around lifted him up.\n\"Why?\"\n\"We are busy, so let's do that later.\"\nAs soon as Chun Yeowun said that, someone fell from the ceiling.\nTak!\nA woman with purple hair, dressed in a tight leather suit, landed on the floor very lightly.\nShe was Shakena.\n\"Phew, Master. I dealt with the others as instructed.\"\n\"You didn't eat anyone, right?\"\n\"Like you said, I only made their hearts stop. None of them looked appetizing anyway.\"\nAfter tasting the heart of a Superior Master, the other hearts didn't seem that tasty anymore.\nShakena was the one who stopped the people in the control room and killed them.\nChun Woo-jin, who couldn't understand it, asked.\n\"Ancestor, that woman?\"\nIgnoring the question, Chun Yeowun gave new instructions to Shakena.\n\"Move him.\"\n\"Yes yes.\"\nShakena approached Chun Woo-jin.\nShe then embraced the old man, who had a bigger build than her.\n\"W-what are you?\"\nAt Chun Woo-jin's bewilderment, she asked.\n\"You can hold your breath, right? Human.\"\n\"What do you…\"\nWoong!\nAt that moment, their bodies turned purple and went into the floor.\nOnce they disappeared into the floor, as if diving into the sea, Chun Yeowun widened the distance.\nWoong!\nAnd a huge amount of Sword qi was raised in his hand.\n\"Would this much be enough?\"\nChun Yeowun used the Sword qi and then began to unfold technique.\nAround 19:15.\nThe atmosphere around the judicial prison was chaotic.\nIf the death penalty had been carried out, the warden would have come out and given a statement, but that didn't happen.\n\"Isn't it taking too long?\"\n\"Did something happen inside?\"\nThe whispering of the present reporters grew louder.\n\"Please step back.\"\n\"The execution isn't done yet.\"\nThe military guards in the front line warned the reporters to not come close.\n\"I don't get it. What kind of sentence takes an hour to execute?\"\n\"Aren't you just trying to hide what happened?\"\nAs one person asked, all reporters began to bombard the military with questions.\nAnd with that, the atmosphere outside the prison turned chaotic.\nSwoosh!\nRight then, a group of men in suits appeared in front of the judicial prison.\nWhen the military people saw the man in the middle, they couldn't hide their shock.\n'Oh Tae-chung!'\nThe man was the head of the Ministry of Murim and next to him were several Murim Association executives, including Jang Pyeong-gak and Tang Moon-su.\nAnd five more executives of the association.\nOh Tae-chung spoke to the military blocking the entrance.\n\"We need to go inside.\"\n\"The execution isn't over yet.\"\nOh Tae-chung asked in a daunting voice.\n\"Does it make sense for an execution to take this long?\"\n\"Th-that…\"\nThe military guards had no way of knowing what was going on inside.\nThey only took the orders from the judicial head and kept guarding the place to make sure no one entered.\n\"You know who is being executed right?\"\n\"… we know.\"\n\"The worst criminal that our world has seen. Don't you know that the evil Demonic Cult wants to break him out?\"\n\"Heavenly God. That is right. And that's why the Murim Association had expressed its intention to help with the security, right?\"\nThey were speaking loud enough for the reporters to hear.\nDue to that, it was clear that the judicial system didn't want the Murim inside the prison.\n'This is…'\nKo Sa-woong, the captain of this team, was at a loss of how to deal with this situation, and not missing the chance, the aide of Oh Taec-chung glanced at the reporters and then shouted.\n\"What the hell is the prison hiding? Reveal what is going on inside!\"\nWhisper!\nAnd it was effective. The reporters too began to make similar demands.\nOh Tae-chung addressed himself to the captain of the team and said.\n\"I have been watching for a while, are you going to do this till the end? I can't help but think that the Ministry of National Defense which has signed an alliance with a certain group has impure intentions.\"\n'Shit!'\nCaptain Ko So-woong bit his lip.\nThere seemed to be no way to stop them.\n\"… reporters aren't allowed.\"\n\"Isn't that natural?\"\nSh!\nWhen the captain raised his hand, the military guards blocking the entrance opened the way.\n'Huhuhu.'\nOh Tae-chung smiled at it.\nHe already knew what was going on inside from the executives of the Murim Association.\nNow, by going inside and turning it upside down through the testimony of the executives he was taking inside, he could be able to corner the Defense.\n\"Come on. Let's enter.\"\nOh Tae-chung boldly led the executives of the association to enter the prison.\nHowever, someone called him.\n\"Wait.\"\n'!?'\nOh Tae-chung turned his head to see the voice owner.\nFrom the west side of the reporters, a middle-aged man in military uniform appeared along with other officers.\nThe man was Ahn Woo-hong, the head of National Defense.\n\"Director Ahn.\"\n\"If something did happen inside, then the Ministry of National Defense, which has been entrusted with the security of the prison, should also investigate.\"\nOh Tae-chung's face went stiff at those words.\nHe didn't expect this man to show up at this time.\n'Huh.'\nHowever, even if the Defense joined them, the results wouldn't change.\nBut the faces of the executives of the Murim Association next to him weren't good.\n\"What is it?\"\nAt Oh Tae-chung's question, Jang Pyeong-gak of the Wudang clan, opened his mouth with a puzzled expression.\n\"Director. Th… that man is a Demonic Cult member.\"\n\"What?\"\nThe person standing next to Ahn Woo-hong, was Chun Yeowun.",

      "content": "Chapter 110: An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth (4)\n“What? Demonic Cult?”\nOh Tae-chung, the head of the Ministry of Murim, frowned.\nIf this man was a Demonic Cult member, then isn’t he a subordinate of Chun Woo-jin, who was being executed right now?\nEven more shocked were the executives of the Murim Association.\n‘How is he?’\nThe Murim Association concentrated all its power on monitoring the Cult in Jinan city. It was to confirm if they were coming to Xian or not.\n‘Weren't we told that no one moved?’\nClearly, the person who was dispatched to Jinan said that none of the Yongchun Group’s executives left the city. So they didn’t understand how this man came here.\n[How did this happen?]\nTang Moon-su, one of the executives, sent a telepathic message.\nHowever, what was the use of asking Jang Pyeong-gak if he himself didn’t know?\n[Oh god. I don’t know either.]\n[Huh, I don’t know if they are smart or stupid.]\nTang Moon-su clicked his tongue.\nNow the judicial prison they were going to enter will be overflowing with corpses. This man had just walked into the trap on his own feet.\n“Haa!”\nAt that time, Oh Tae-chun snorted.\nHe didn’t like this, and he never liked the Yongchun group who were always trying to make an agreement with the National Defense.\n“How dare yo…”\nShh!\nTag Moon-su grabbed him, however, he didn’t stop and kept trying to yell.\n[Director. Please hold back.]\nOh Tae-chung wasn’t well versed in martial arts, but he knew the basics.\nKnowing that it was the technique to convey thoughts, Oh Tae-chung went silent.\n‘Shit.’\nThere were a lot of people around.\nThe reporters were already holding their cameras.\nOh Tae-chun looked at Tang Moon-su and the other executives.\n[Maybe this is for the good.]\n‘This is for the good?’\n[That man is a representative of the current Demonic Cult.]\nThe executives of Murim Association kept telling him in detail about the Demonic Cult and about this man being called Chun Ma.\nAt those words, Oh Tae-chun’s eyes narrowed.\n‘Representative?’\nSo this man was truly a Demonic Cult member, and he believed it, but if he was a representative then things are different.\n[That man is the one who attacked the Association. If that man is arrested on the spot using the incident in the judicial prison and reported to the media, the process will proceed smoothly.]\nOh Tae-chung seemed satisfied with Tang Moon-su’s words.\n‘With that we can certainly put pressure on the National Defense.’\nOh Tae-chung regained his composure, and spoke to Ahn Woo-hong.\n“The Ministry of National Defense has been entrusted with the security by the Judiciary, so it’s only natural for you to enter. But you want that young man to accompany you?”\nOh Tae-chung asked.\nActually, he was still angry and on the verge of yelling at the man who didn’t seem to care about anything.\nAhn Woo-hong answered.\n“Huhu, this is the vice-chairman of the Yongchun Group that just signed a contract with the Ministry of National Defense. He is the head of an organization which uses martial arts, just like the Murim Association, so if any problem would emerge, I brought him along to seek advice.”\n“Ahh, is that so? There are better advisors here, but I don’t know why you had to bring him.”\nSaid Oh Tae-chung sarcastically.\n‘Better advisors?’\nAhn Woo-hong snorted.\nHe witnessed Chun Yeowun’s monstrous strength with his own eyes, so he had full confidence in him.\n“Well, this man is the most reliable. Heheh.”\nOh Tae-chung got annoyed at those words.\n‘Let’s see how that attitude changes.’\nFrom the moment they entered the prison, he was sure that Ahn Woo-hong would back down.\n“Let’s enter.”\nOh Tae-chung took the first move and went to the entrance.\nHe was then followed by the secretaries and the executives.\nJang Pyeong-gak couldn’t take his eyes off Chun Yeowun the entire time.\n‘He is a dangerous person.’\nHe was very wary of Chun Yeowun.\nHe heard from Saint Nogak that the Chun Ma of the Demonic Cult meant a warrior who surpassed the Lord of the Cult, but no one believed it.\nHowever, when they came face to face rather than through a hologram, he felt weird.\n‘… however, all the media is concentrated here, even foreign ones. No matter how evil he is, he won’t be able to walk out if he does something wrong.’\nAt least, if he wasn’t an idiot, he wouldn’t do it.\nIf that happens then their entire plan to resurrect the Demonic Cult will be blown away.\nThe Murim was a structure which was close to the public and the government.\nThey went inside through the revolving door at the entrance.\nClick!\nIt was tinted, so the ones on the outside couldn’t see anything, and the lights were flickering on and off, as if some electrical problem was happening.\n‘They did it right.’\nThe executives nodded with a smile.\nEven when they opened their qi senses, they could feel nothing.\nWheeing!\nThe Ministry of National Defense also went inside.\nAnd the executives started to act.\n“Looks like something is wrong.”\n“I don’t feel anything here.”\nOh Tae-chung helped them out.\n“Come on, let’s head to the execution site.”\n“Director. The execution is in the basement.”\nThe secretaries led them down the stairs to the basement.\nThe faces of Oh Tae-chung and the executives were full of anticipation.\nThey started to get curious as to how the faces of Ahn Woo-hang and Chun Yeowun would look.\nAs soon as they began to go down, a foul stench of blood hit them.\nAnd then dead bodies greeted them.\n“Euk!”\nThe secretaries, who weren’t familiar with such situations, covered their noses and frowned.\nEven knowing about the circumstances before, they couldn’t stay calm.\n“What the hell happened here?”\n“Looks like someone broke inside.”\nThe executives were the first to speak, and Oh Tae-chung acted with them.\nThe first scene was about to be done.\nShhh!\nThe body lying on the front side had sharp scars.\nTo examine it, they wiped the blood stains on the wound with a towel.\n‘Uh?’\nJang Pyeong-gak’s eyes narrowed.\nThe marks had to be from the Demonic Cult’s martial arts.\n‘What is this…’\nHowever, the traces were different from the Demonic Cult’s.\nTang Moon-su urged Jang Pyeong-gak who didn’t say his line.\n‘What happened?’\nHe wanted to urge the man to say that there were traces of the Demonic Cult’s martial arts on the bodies.\nAnd then Jang Pyeong-gak answered him.\n[… we have a problem.]\nTang Moon-su, who thought it was strange, went closer to inspect the wounds.\nAnd looked at the corpses.\n‘Wha-what?’\nHe couldn’t hide his dismay.\nAs warriors of Superior Master level, they were knowledgeable.\nAnd it was possible for them to guess the killer's martial arts by looking at the scars, but what was on the corpses was not the traces of the Demonic cult.\n‘This… blade marks.’\nIt wasn’t just ordinary marks.\nTang Moon-su also looked at the other corpses.\nAs he looked at the second body and third, his eyes trembled.\n‘What the hell is all this?’\nUnless his eyes were deceiving him, the scars were blade techniques.\nAnd that was.\n“Blade God Six Martial arts.”\n‘Who said that!’\nAs someone said it loudly, Jang Pyeong-gak and Tang Moon-su looked at the person.\nIt was Chun Yeowun.\n‘Damn it!’\nTang Moon-su couldn’t hide this shock at the situation.\nWhat Chun Yeowun said was the right answer.\nThe sword marks on the body were caused by the Blade Six’s Blade God Six Martial Clan’s technique.\n‘How is this even possible?’\nThe corpses had traces of that technique.\nThe traces were too apparent to claim that the Demonic Cult created them.\nAt that moment, Oh Tae-chun shouted out.\n“No! Doesn’t this mean that these traces are of the Demonic cult?”\n‘!?’\nJang Pyeong-gak and Tang Moon-su went stiff at that.\nThis was a problem.\n‘This…’\nOh Tae-chung hadn’t mastered martial arts, and they didn’t even tell him what they discovered.\nSo he still claimed that the traces were of the Cult.\n“Director…”\nJang Pyeong-gak tried to correct him.\nHowever, Oh Tae-chung looked at Chun Yeowun and went ahead.\n“I am asking what happened?! Why do the bodies of the bailiffs have traces of the Demonic Cult’s martial arts?”\nOh Tae-chung’s face was showing happy expressions.\nHe was hoping for Ahn Woo-hong to be flustered.\nHowever, the reaction they had was so far from expected.\n“If I hadn’t come here, they would have said that everything was done by the Cult.”\nChun Yeowun spoke disappointedly.\n“No. What are you saying…”\nOh Tae-chung, unaware of the situation, was about to speak up, but Jang Pyeong-gak intervened.\n“Director. That isn’t Demonic Cul…”\nSwosh!\n“Ugh!”\nAt that moment, something sharp touched Jang Pyeong-gak’s neck.\nBlood dripped from his skin which was a little scratched.\nA little to the side, and his throat would have been pierced.\n“W-what are you?”\nPanicked, Jang Pyeong-gak glared at Chun Yeowun and shouted.\n“You have been saying Demonic Cult till now, but since when was the Sky Demon Order called Demonic Cult?”\nDemonic Cult was a term used to demean the Sky Demon Order. Despite having an official name, people called it Cult.\n“Look here. Even if that is the case, this is too much!”\nTang Moon-su stood up and tried to protest.\nIt was to change the topic and cover the mistake that Oh Tae-chung made.\nIn a stern voice, Chun Yeowun said.\n“Is that so, then should I call you the Murim Association?”\nTang Moon-su was speechless for a moment.\nIf he said okay, then it would mean he was intentionally calling it the Demonic cult.\nWiping the blood from the neck, Jang Pyeong-gak apologized.\n“I didn’t mean to demean the Cult. I apologize.”\n“I don’t need your apologizing, tell the truth.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, Jang Pyeong-gak bit his lip.\nA difficult situation would come up if it was revealed that the traces on the corpses were of the Blade Six’s clan.\n‘If that happens, it won’t just be the Blade Six which will be suspected.’\nHowever, he couldn’t lie in front of Chun Yeowun or the Ministry of National Defense. So contemplating, he opened his mouth.\n“Director. These aren’t the traces of the Demo- Sky Demon Order.”\n“Huh? What is that supposed to mean?”\nOh Tae-chung’s face contorted at it.\nHis eyes were asking, just what the hell happened.\n‘What the hell is he trying to say?’\nDang Moon-su looked at Jang Pyeong-gak with worried eyes.\nIf he said something wrong, then Blade Six will become the culprits of the incident.\n‘Kuak! Especially with the Ministry of National Defense!’\nIf only the National Defense wasn’t here, they would have changed the scars on the corpses.\nThinking that their plan was successful, they even brought in another department inside the prison.\nJang Pyeong-gak spoke cautiously.\n“It seems to be a different martial arts, but I think we should officially investigate this with the experts in the association.”\nFor now, that was the best way out.\n‘Good job!’\nTang Moon-su praised the man for solving the issue, however, something unexpected happened.\n“I guess the justice seeking warriors are very political.”\n“What?”\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun’s blade passed through Jang Pyeong-gak’s shoulder.\nSlash!\nThe sleeves of his white clothes were soaked red and the severed arm fell down.\n“Kuak!”\nPang Pyeong-gak screamed as he held onto the cut hand.\nIn response, the other people of the association pulled out their weapons.\nShh! Shh!\n“What is this?”\nTang Moon-su yelled at Chun Yeowun.\nWho would have imagined that he would dare do such a thing?\nChun Yeowun opened his mouth.\n“Everyone here should know that the martial arts of the Blade God Six Martial clan are impossible to learn unless one belonged to the clan. And now you want to give out the results after investigating it? Are the martial arts and enlightenment you gained just for decoration?”\nThe martial arts of the Blade God Six Martial clan could only be learned properly when the human body exceeds the limit.\nEven the warriors who learned the best martial arts could never copy their techniques as their joints and muscles wouldn’t withstand it.\nIn response to Chun Yeowun remarks, Tang Moon-su spoke.\n“W-we don’t know that. It is just that Blade Six could never do this, so we are trying to be fair to them so that no one would frame them.”\n“Fair?”\n“Right! I want to do things fairly…”\n“You are very good at making shitty statements.”\n“W-what?”\nChun Yeowun answered him.\n“So when people die with the traces of my Cult, the Cult is punished right away, but when they die with the traces of the Blade God Six Martial clan, the clan is treated fairly?”\n‘!!!’\nTag Moon-su’s face distorted at that.\nHe had to calm his emotions and talk, but he wasn’t able to.\nWoong!\nIt was because of the energy that Chun Yeowun was releasing.\nHe was suffocating with the energy spread around.\nTang Moon-si barely opened his mouth.\n“W-what are you releasing the energy for?”\n“For this.”\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun’s sword drew a unique trajectory, passed through various members of the association and then went for Oh Tae-chung.\n‘Ugh!’\nIt happened so fast that Oh Tae-chung couldn’t do anything but stand bewildered, and the body fell down, into pieces.\nTuk tuk tuk tuk!\n‘What is that!’\nTang Moon-su’s eyes widened at what he saw.\nThe trajectory which Chun Yeowun just unfolded was the technique of the Blade God Six Martial clan.",

      "content": "Chapter 111: Reversal (1)\n'!?'\nSomething no one could have imagined happened.\nThe murder of the head of the Ministry of the Murim, occurring right in front of their eyes…\nAnd in the building of the State Council.\nThe secretaries, who were stabbed, pulled out their guns and aimed them at Chun Yeowun.\n\"Raise your hands!\"\n\"You are under the arrest of the head of the Ministry of Murim!\"\nThey surrounded Chun Yeowun.\nYet, not a single person moved close to him to arrest him.\nBecause they worked for the Murim, they knew well how terrifying warriors were and that they could dodge the bullets.\nA secretary yelled.\n\"Y-You can't escape from here even if you are a warrior! Raise your hands right now…\"\n\"How Annoying.\"\nBefore the speech was done, Chun Yeowun gestured lightly, and the gun shattered.\nCrack!\n\"Ugh!\"\n\"G-gun!\"\nWhen the gun broke, the secretaries who were frightened backed away.\nThe executives of the association were at a loss for words at Chun Yeowun's overwhelming strength.\n'He broke the gun with energy alone?'\nThat would be difficult for even Supreme Masters.\nThey knew that Chun Yeowun was strong, but this was too much.\n'No. if we don't deal with this one, we might all get killed.'\nOne of the executives behind Chun Yeowun, Sung Gu-hwan, tried to attack him.\nPhat!\nThe moment he tried to stab him in the back with his dagger…\nGrab!\n\"Hmm!\"\nChun Yeowun turned around and grabbed his face. Sung Gu-hwan raised his internal energy and tried to get rid of the hand, but Chun Yeowun didn't budge.\n\"You don't seem to realise how weak you are.\"\n\"Uhm! Uhm!\"\nSung Gu-hwan struggled.\nCrack!\nChun Yeowun's fingers dug into his head.\n\"Kuak!\"\nSung Gu-hwang's head exploded like a smashed watermelon.\n\"S-Mr. Sung!\"\nThe sight of the corpse on the floor with a smashed head, left everyone speechless.\nIt was such a cruel way to kill someone.\n'… this was a trap.'\nDan Moon-su's eyes went wide.\nHe understood what this was about the moment Oh Tae-chung was murdered by the martial arts of Blade Six.\n'It was somehow strange.'\nThe corpses of the bailiffs must have left traces of the Demonic cult.\nThe one thing he didn't understand was just how Chun Yeowun managed to learn the martial arts of the Blade God Six Martial clan.\n'Even within Blade Six, I've heard that there were only a few who mastered their techniques properly.'\nSince it is called the best swordsmanship, every clan tried to analyse it and learn it, but the conclusion they all came to was that it was impossible to learn.\n'Wait… the fact that he left trails of martial arts of Blade God Six Martial clan which is only that one cla…'\nIt meant that the clan would be accused of being criminals.\nIn that case, it was safe to say that the association was being used to reverse the situation.\n'Then, it wasn't that they came here to prevent being framed, but to kill all of us and frame the Blade Six as real culprits.'\nTang Moon-su felt a chill run down his spine.\nIt was surprising that this man appeared alone here and performed such a daring thing, knowing that he was within the State Council site and under the eyes of the media.\n\"I think you are on his side.\"\nTang Moon-su stared at Ahn Woo-hong.\nDespite the murder of Oh Tae-chung, he was just watching the scene with his arms crossed.\nAlong with the other people of the Defense.\n\"… is it alright for the Minister of National Defense to be like this?\"\nIn response to Tang Moon-su's question, Ahn Woo-hong expressed his opinion.\n\"Huhuhu, I made a promise to never interfere in the affairs of the Murim people.\"\n'Ha!'\nInsane!\nThe head of the Ministry of Murim was killed right before his eyes, and he's calling it interfering with a matter between Murim?\nTang Moon-su bit his lip.\nIt was foolish to ask for Ahn Woo-hong's help.\nFrom the time the agreement was signed, the National Defense has become the Demonic cult's ally.\n\"If you get it, then I can't let you leave.\"\nChun Yeowun took a step towards Tang Moon-su and the executives.\nThe secretaries of the Murim ministry tried to escape thinking that it was their last hope.\nCrack!\n\"Kuak!\"\n\"Kuak!\"\nThey were unable to take even a single step.\nChun Yeowun snapped the secretary's neck by just wiggling his fingers.\nAnd as he was about to move to another one, someone blocked him.\nWith drops of blood dripping on the floor, Jang Pyeong-gak stood there.\n\"Haa…\"\nDespite having a severed arm, Jang Pyeong-gak drew his sword with the other hand and raised his energy.\nDespite his injury, the energy roared around like a haze.\n\"Elder Jang!\"\n\"I… I will risk my life to stop this person. Please inform the media about this.\"\nJang Pyeong-gak was risking his life to stop Chun Yeowun.\n'If I could stop him, then they might hae a chance.'\nThe two men, including Tang Moon-su, were Superior Masters.\nAll they had to do was get upstairs.\n\"Please go!\"\nPhat!\nAs he shouted, Jang Pyeong-gak tried to use his sword.\nHe used the 7th formation of the clan's sword.\nIt was one of the three swordsmanship styles that only the strongest of the Wudang clan could learn, and it was the kind of swordsmanship that could overturn the results.\nChachacha!\nJang Pyeong-gak's sword quickly filled the space.\nHe used the technique to buy time.\n\"Kuak. Mr. Jang!\"\nThe executives immediately turned around, and they ran for the stairway.\nAt that moment, a scream came from behind them with a sharp sound.\n\"Kuak!\"\nTang Moon-su spread his distance, and glanced without realising.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun was running behind them.\n'!?'\nAnd in Chun Yeowun's right hand, was someone's hair.\nThe head of Jang Pyeong-gak.\nAs soon as he unfolded the technique, his head was cut off.\n'Crazy bastard!'\nAlthough he was injured, it was the desperate sacrifice of a Superior Master.\nPondering for a moment, Tang Moon-so thought if he should run away? Or use himself as a shield for the others.\nAnd his choice.\n\"Do not stop!\"\nHe hurriedly pressed a button on his sleeve with his finger. Then, something appeared on the upper and lower body of the suit he was wearing.\n'If I can use this, everything within a 20-meter radius will explode.'\nThat was the only way to stop the monster. W\nWithout hesitation, he opened his arms.\n\"Ah! You Demonic cult warrior! Receive the technology of DANG!\"\nPapapah!\nTiny needles lodged in the body were fired.\nAt the same time, something like smoke began to ooze out.\nThey would explode once fired, but what was even serious was that the poison would definitely kill the target.\n'DG-1200.'\nIt was a chemical weapon called the Devil's Gas.\nIt was made by combining the poison arts and modern chemical technology. When it comes in contact with the smoke, the body starts to corrode and dies within 1 minute.\nIt is the worst method, but there was no other option now.\n\"Kuak!\"\nNo person would be able to withstand it.\nHowever, this happened.\n\"Ugh?\"\nHe was puzzled because the needles he released should have spread out, but instead, they gathered at one place.\nSwoosh!\nIt was where Chun Yeowun reached out his hand.\nEven the poison gas which was being released was sucked into the air and then disappeared.\nIt was as if the air around Chun Yeowun turned into a vacuum cleaner.\n\"W-what the hell…\"\nHe never thought that the most dangerous technology made by his family would be countered this way.\nIn the midst of his bewilderment, Chun Yeowun moved to him.\n\"W-wait up!\"\n\"You don't seem that good.\"\nChak!\n\"Kuak!\"\nThe 5th formation, Extreme Art of Blade God, which was unfolded by Chun Yeowun, cut off Tang Moon-su's head.\n\"It is worth it.\"\nChun Yeowun smiled.\nThe new thing he learnt was used quickly and effectively.\nChun Yeowun himself was invincible, so the gas wouldn't have affected him anyway, but Ahn Woo-hong and his officers who have been in danger.\nAhn Woo-hong, who was silent till then, spoke.\n\"Master Chun! Those people are heading up.\"\nIf they were missed, everything they did till now would be a waste.\nAt that, Chun Yeowun spoke as if it wasn't a big deal.\n\"No need to worry.\"\n\"Everyone is coming!\"\nThe four executives of the association who went up to the first floor brightened as they saw the entrance to the hallway.\nIf they could just leave, they would be able to speak about what happened to the reporters.\n\"We cannot let their sacrifices be in vain!\"\nIf they didn't hurry, the monster would arrive soon.\nSince their strength wouldn't even harm him, they had to go out and tell the truth.\nIt was the moment they were about to open the door and get out.\nShhh!\nSomeone had come up to the hallway.\nThat person had purple hair, Shakena.\nAnd with a broad smile, she asked.\n\"Where are you going?\"\nShe had been there waiting for them for so long that she was getting bored.\nSeeing her, the association members went stiff.\n'Ha! Now people with superpowers are making fun of us.'\nThe executives considered themselves to be talented.\nHowever, they knew that they weren't a match for the monster in the basement.\nSeo Dae-bong drew his sword and shouted at Shakena.\n\"Young lady! If you don't get out of the way, you'll die…!\"\nShhh!\n\"What?\"\nHer body suddenly went to the left side of Seo Dae-bong.\nConfused, he swung his sword to the left, but Shakena used her leg to block it.\n'Stupid bitch! To try and block sword energy with bare legs.'\nClang!\n'What was that!?'\nThe sword, which had blue-coloured sword energy on it, was cut in half.\nWithout stopping there, her foot still kept coming in and hit Seo Dae-bong on his left shoulder.\nPuck! Crack!\n\"Kuak!\"\nHis body, unable to handle the force, crashed into the wall.\nPhat!\nThe panicked executives stopped running and tried to move away from the woman.\nThey couldn't hide their shock as they saw the most capable person among them being taken down.\n\"To take down Mr. Seo with just one kick?\"\n'What is that woman?'\nIf she had this kind of power and such looks, then surely people would have talked about the woman.\nHowever, they haven't heard about her till now.\nNot knowing what to do, Shakena pointed her finger at one person and said.\n\"Count. How long are you going to pretend that you don't know me?\"\nThe person Shakena pointed to was the Jong-seong clan's Doun.\nThe other two executives wondered what she was talking about.\nGrab!\n\"Ah-what?\"\n\"Elder Doun! What are you doing?\"\nElder Doun grabbed both people from behind.\nThe two panicked and tried to get away from the grasp as they raised their internal energy, but the grip was too strong for them to move.\nCrack!\n\"Kuak!\"\n\"S-stop… kuak!\"\nJust by grabbing the neck, he was able to break off the bones.\nElder Doun, holding the two heads, exuded a gloomy aura and spoke as if he was annoyed by the situation.\n\"I hid my energy as much as possible, how did you know?\"\n\"I was almost confused. Hiding energy means hiding everything.\"\nShakena barely felt any energy from the person.\nIf she hadn't gotten this close to him, she wouldn't have even realised it.\n\"I wasn't sure if you were alive. I didn't hear any news, so I thought that the traitor was dead.\"\nDoun didn't answer Shakena's words.\nRather, he ran at her.\n\"I guess you don't like talking about it?\"\nShakena clenched her fists as elder Doun ran towards her.\nHowever, he moved back right away and threw a dagger at her neck.\nShhh!\nDue to her phasing ability, it just passed through her.\nAt that moment, Doun tried to run ahead and get out of the place.\n\"You!\"\nShakena tried to catch up to him, but he was already way ahead of her. He was running at the speed of light.\nIn a couple of seconds, he would be out.\nAround 8 meters ahead of the entrance.\nBang!\nThe floor shattered, and someone blocked the way for Elder Doun.\nIt was Chun Yeowun.\n\"Who said you could leave?\"\nChun Yeowun asked, making Elder Doun smirk as he said.\n\"You are arrogant, human. Don't think I am the same as them.\"\nWoong!\nTremendous energy began to explode from Doun's body.\nIt was gloomy and evil.\nHe, who gathered enough energy to deal with Chun Yeowun, immediately moved like a beast going for its prey.\nShhh!\n\"If a high ranking warrior like me combines my power with martial arts, your neck, made of human flesh, wou…\"\nPak!\n\"Kuak!\"\nAs he came in, Chun Yeowun grabbed Doun's neck in an instant and lifted him up.\nDoun, who was in an unexpected situation, couldn't hide his shock.\n'W-what the hell?'\nChun Yeowun smiled and said.\n\"What is so different? Demon.\"\nUpon hearing that word, Doun's expression was distorted.",

      "content": "Chapter 112: Reversal (2)\nDoun, who heard the word 'demon' from Chun Yeowun's mouth, was surprised.\nHe was in human form now, so he shouldn't have been able to know.\n'How did he know who I am?'\nShakena walked up to him and spoke sarcastically.\n\"Huh. Indeed, my master is the best.\"\n'Master?'\nDoun looked confused at Shakena.\nCalling someone master according to their clan meant defeat.\n\"It must be you.\"\nDoun glared at Shakena. Chun Yeowun's eyes narrowed at that.\n'I am holding his neck, but he doesn't seem to have a problem talking.'\nDemon's neck was different from ordinary humans. A trained warrior normally protected his neck, but not this demon.\nLike Shakena, demons were born with a combat-type body.\n\"Heart Hunter Shakena has a human as a master? How funny.\"\n\"Shut up.\"\nBang!\nChun Yeowun knocked him to the floor.\nAs if he didn't care about being hurt, Doun looked up at Chun Yeowun in anger for being thrown to the floor.\n\"How dare a human!\"\nGrab!\nDoun grabbed Chun Yeowun's wrists, which were close to him.\n\"I will twist them!\"\nAs he held the wrists with the strength of a demon, he tried to break them.\nBut.\n'What?'\nChun Yeowun's wrists didn't break despite the amount of strength he used on them.\n'Is it because of energy?'\nDoun immediately grasped the problem.\nDeciding that Chun Yeowun must be using internal energy to protect himself, he changed his methods.\n\"Human. You aren't the only one who can do martial arts.\"\nReplacing the energy of demons, he began to infuse energy into Chun Yeowun's abdomen.\nPang! Kwang!\n\"Euk!\"\nHowever, instead of hurting Chun Yeowun, his body only dug deeper into the ground.\nDoun couldn't understand what had happened.\n'What the hell?'\nThe fighting sense of demons exceeded that of humans. Besides, this demon had even learned martial arts.\n'Why is it not working?'\nChun Yeowun's ability to manipulate energy was beyond his imagination.\nDoun had no choice but to acknowledge that Chun Yeowun was stronger than him.\n\"It seems like you are done analyzing.\"\nDoun's expression contorted.\nChun Yeowun continued to speak, not caring for him.\n\"Do you understand that it's useless to continue struggling?\"\n\"How can a human have such power…\"\n\"If you want to know that, then tell me why you were one of the executives of the Murim Association.\"\nAt Chun Yeowun's question, the demon smiled.\nGlaring at Chun Yeowun, he said.\n\"You certainly have surpassed the human limits. I don't think I will be able to defeat you if I don't use my ability.\"\n\"Ability?\"\nShhh!\nAt that moment, the neck muscles in the demon's body softened.\nIt moved like water or sweat around Chun Yeowun's hand.\n'What is this now?'\nChun Yeowun frowned.\nThis was such a strange ability, and Shakena yelled.\n\"Master. He has the ability to freely manipulate his body.\"\nDoun, who went soft and slimy, went back to human form again.\nHis face, which had been a human till a moment ago, was now exotic looking like Shakena.\nHe was a handsome man with long brown hair and a sharp nose.\n\"So that is your real face.\"\n\"I was trying to maintain my human form, but you made me show this, so you'll have to pay the price…\"\nShhh!\n\"Uh?\"\nBefore he could even finish his words, Chun Yeowun was in front of him.\nThe demon managed to move a little and avoid getting hit.\nChun Yeowun extended his fist towards that.\n\"Huh!\"\nBewildered, the demon changed the rigidity of his body. His whole body turned grey and then hard like a stone.\nPuck! Tak!\nThe new demon was pushed back about four steps, but he didn't take any damage, so he said.\n\"Kuak,did you see it? If I make up my mind, not just internal energy, but even sword energy won't touch my body.\"\n\"Is that so?\"\nAs soon as he said that, Chun Yeowun grabbed the neck with lightning-like movements.\nPak!\n\"It's no use!\"\nThe demon tried to change his body into a smile.\nHowever, from Chun Yeowun's hand, a strong cold spread around.\nJjjkkkk!\n\"T-this!\"\nThe cold penetrated into his body and then his slimy body grew stiff.\nThe demon, who didn't expect Chun Yeowun to do this, was shocked.\nAt that, Chun Yeowun clenched his fist once more.\n\"Did you say you were too strong?\"\n\"What?\"\nChun Yeowun's clenched fist was embodied with energy.\nThe demon screamed as he looked at the fist which was condensing and unifying energy enough to shake the space.\n\"W-wait!\"\n\"Too late.\"\nPuak!\nChun Yeowun's first pierced the demon's abdomen.\n\"Kuak!\"\nAt that moment, the floor collapsed because of the impact and they fell into the basement.\nBang!\nThe demon opened his eyes and looked around, unsure what to do, but Chun Yeowun was ready with his fists clenched again.\nBewildered, the demon tried to block it.\nBang!\n\"Kuak!\"\nChun Yeowun's fist hit his face this time.\nAlthough he managed to stop it because the coldness inside his body ended, the face went in like rubber, probably because his ability was halted for a moment.\n\"Ouch!\"\n\"What are you doing?\"\nChun Yeowun didn't stop and struck the demon's chest.\nBang!\nThe basement collapsed and the demon's body fell into the second basement floor.\nA groan went out of the Demon's mouth.\n\"Kuaaah!\"\nChun Yeowun clenched his fists and lifted him again.\nThe demon, who watched it, shouted in shock.\n\"St-stop!\"\n\"I am not done yet.\"\n\"I give up! Surrender! I will surrender so please stop!\"\nEven if he was a demon, he was hit three times in a row with a fist which could shake the space, so there was no way he would continue to fight.\nThere was no blood, but blue smoke was rising from the demon's body.\n'This, this one isn't a human.'\nThe demon looked at Chun Yeowun with tired eyes.\nThe humans he knew were insignificant beings with many weaknesses to exploit. But this one in front of him was a monster that he couldn't even deal with.\n\"Surrender…\"\nFor demons, that meant defeat.\nSafe to say that the demon had no intention of fighting anymore and would obey the winner's decision.\nHowever, this demon wasn't reliable.\nNot letting the energy out, Chun Yeowun uttered.\n\"You will surrender to me?\"\n\"… yes.\"\nHe spoke in a voice that didn't sound very believable.\nAt that, Chun Yeowun smiled and raised his fist again.\n\"I don't think you have been tamed well.\"\nWoong!\n'No… way!'\nThe energy which was being condensed this time couldn't be compared to the previous one.\nThe demon's eyes widened as if they would explode.\n'!!!'\nAt that level, forget pain, even the body of the demon would perish.\nThe demon hurriedly shouted.\n\"According to the law of the clan, Count Deo will concede defeat! Everything will be at the disposal of the victor. Take my life or make me your slave, as you will.\"\n\"Huh.\"\nChun Yeowun laughed at that.\nThe change in attitude was quick, probably because he had been living in human society for long.\nChun Yeowun looked down at Deo unsure of what to do.\nHe was contemplating whether to kill him or not. Deo anxiously waited for Chun Yeowun's decision.\n'Well?'\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun raised his head upwards.\nFrom outside the building, people began to move, a sense of urgency and the sound of gathering at the entrance.\n'Nano. Raise the volume and let me hear it.'\n[Yes.]\nNano amplified the sound above.\nHe heard reporters constantly ask what was happening inside. It was probably because the floor collapsed.\n'This is so annoying.'\nHe reduced as much energy as he could when he was subduing the demon, but it seemed like the sound wasn't blocked.\nKuk!\nChun Yeowun looked at Deo's face. The face which was punched in like a rubber doll, was back to normal.\n\"Hoh.\"\nSeeing that, a good idea came to Chun Yeowun.\n\"You. I will accept you as a slave.\"\n\"Ah!\"\nDeo's face brightened as he was scared that he would kill him.\n'If only I get to live…'\nHe thought he'd always have a chance.\nAt that, Chun Yeowun lightly stretched out his sword at Deo.\n'Huh?'\nAnd that moment, great pain passed through his body, the core in his chest was touched.\n\"Kuak!\"\nDeo's body twisted in pain as if some sharp blade was stabbing him. He had never experienced such pain in his life.\nChun Yeowun said.\n\"I put a Heart Sword into your core. From now on, if you do what I tell you to do, I will remove it.\"\n\"H-heart Sword?\"\nHeart Sword.\nA sword of heart.\nIt was a sword based on the will of a warrior who had reached the Heavenly Master level.\nSince he learned martial arts, Deo recognized it.\n'Is that even possible?'\nHe thought warriors were just imagining it.\nNow he was genuinely afraid of Chun Yeowun.\nAs he clutched his chest with a pale face, Chun Yeowun said.\n\"If it is you, then you can endure the pain.\"\n'!?'\nDeo was confused.\nEven now, he was still afraid of being killed.\n'He-he is a true devil!'\nWhisper! Whisper!\n\"Open it!\"\n\"What was that noise just now!\"\n\"How could the military stay silent!\"\nThe military was flustered by the actions of the reporters who kept making a fuss to enter through the barricade.\nIf only the foreign reporters weren't there, they would have forcibly sent back the domestic reporters.\nWhen it came to a scoop, reporters were fearless.\n'I am losing it!'\nCaptain Ko Sa-wong, glanced at the prison.\nEven he wondered what was happening inside.\nSince the director of the Ministry of National Defense went inside, he wanted to walk in and make sure he was safe.\n\"Let us enter!\"\n\"I said you can't!\"\nBoth sides were in a tense confrontation.\nBang!\nA huge roar at the entrance of the prison.\nEveryone outside looked at it.\nKwakwang!\nA sound of battle inside, and then suddenly something broke through the wall instead of the building entrance.\nIt was a human.\nThe reporters were quick to take the pictures.\nThe human had a puzzled look as it covered his face and hurried somewhere.\nPhat!\nIt was so fast that they lost track of where he went.\nThe reporters couldn't get enough details.\nHowever, a reporter played a reel he caught and looked at the human.\n\"Uh, this, this one….\"\nShockingly, the person in the photo was Geum Song-ryong, the chairman of Blade Six.\nA frown appeared on his face, but the reporter was certain.\n‘Yah! Chairman Geum Song-ryong!’\nA photo of the head of one of the five largest conglomerates in China caused a riot among the reporters.",

      "content": "Chapter 113: Reversal (3)\nAn old fashioned and spacious office.\nThe news was broadcast along with the words 'Special Program' as a relay screen on a 100 inch no bezel wall tv.\nA middle-aged anchor in the room said.\n-We have informed you of the terrible incident that had occurred in the State Council's judicial prison last night, which broke the news. We will take time to inform you of the current situation in detail. Reporter Woo Hyun-bong at the scene will now speak to us.\nThe screen was split in half and revealed the judicial prison in the background. It had yellow and black tape sealing it, written on it 'No Entry'.\nA young reporter spoke.\n-Yes. This is Woo Hyun-bong at the scene.\n-Reporter Woo. What is going on over there?\n-Yes. As you can see, this is the scene of the incident.\nNumerous military soldiers and the state council policemen were guarding it. The bodies found inside were being moved outside.\n-Bodies are still being found inside the site. The search has been going since 20:00 last night and till noon today. That was how horrific the incident was.\n-I can assume that the State Council isn't giving us a clear answer, is that right?\n-The press conference, which started at 10 am, is still going on. Let's connect to the conference room.\nThe split-screen was back to one.\nAnd then the scene changed to the press conference hall of the State Council.\nThe deputy prime minister of the Standing State Council was seen having a question and answer session with the reporters.\nThe reporters were asking questions.\n-This is Ahn Je-hyeon, of Beijing TV news. Deputy prime minister, if so, then is the culprit of this bloody crime the chairman of Blade Six, Geum Song-ryong?\nThe deputy prime minister frowned in response and said.\n-We aren't sure yet.\nThe reason why the deputy prime minister was reluctant to answer was simple.\nThe Blade Six company boasted was in the top 5 businesses of the world. Starting with the defence industry, there was no field it left untouched, so it wasn't possible to conclude the chairman of that company as a suspect.\n-If you look at the opinions of the experts who conducted the autopsy, and the photos of the body, it is likely that chairman Geum Song-ryong is the culprit. What do you think?\nMost of the reporters were already convinced of it.\nTherefore, the focus of the interview was mostly on that.\n-Hmm, please refrain from making hasty reports in a situation where accurate announcements haven't been made by any department.\nThe deputy prime minister maintained a calm attitude.\nSomeone who was watching the TV changed the channel.\nClick!\nAs the screen changed, other news channels brought breaking news.\nIt was one of the public broadcasts of JHBC, and it was the channel with the most viewers.\nIt was broadcasting an exclusive report now.\n-View the video obtained by our JHBC.\nAfter the anchor was done, the screen switched to a CCTV video.\nThe figure of an old man tied to a firing squad was seen on the screen. Around him were people dressed in bailiff uniforms.\nAnd the anchor tried to narrate it.\nThe old man tied there is the head of the dissolved Black Sky Company, known to be the culprit for the massacre 27 years back. Let's watch this video again.\nIn the video, the masked people were seen moving around the old man.\n-You are going to act till the end. Huh, did you think that I wouldn't be able to recognize just because you know the martial arts of the Cult? Your cultivation is so different from ours.\n-Tch. You have been stuck here rotting, but you still have good eyes. Welll, that's to be expected from the former Five Great Warriors.\n-You people! Are you really going to do the same trick as before? Are you trying to frame the Cult by making fake traces again?\n-For you to say this to us, it'll only stimulate us. I don't know if you are bold or just lost fear.\n-Fear? Ha! Do you think I would be afraid of you?\n-It will be better if you are afraid. Lord of Demonic Cult. Because your usefulness ended as of today.\nThe masked man took out a syringe.\n-Huhuhu, Lord of the Demonic Cult. I will pay tribute to you, to the Lord of the Cult, who is being sacrificed for justice to the very end.\nFinally, the video was cut off. The screen switched back to the newsroom.\n-This video that we urgently obtained is from a CCTV camera in the basement of the prison. It has been analyzed that this wasn't manipulated based on the video experts…\nBang!\nBefore the anchor was even down, a glass flew over the screen. And the glass was lodged into the screen like a weapon.\nCrackle!\nSparks went off on the monitor.\nA man hidden in the shadows walked closer and another man knelt in front of him and asked.\n\"Are you sure you handled the situation well?\"\nAt the question, the man answered in a trembling voice.\n\"W-we definitely dealt with it very carefully. We gave instructions in case there was an emergency too, and we requested the help of elder Doun.\"\n\"Then how did this happen?\"\nThe man in the shadows pretended to grab something with his hand. At that moment, the left elbow of the person who was kneeling was bent.\nCrack!\n\"Kuaak!\"\nHe was in gruesome pain, but he stopped screaming. And the man in the shadows continued.\n\"Ah, I forgot. The human body is always weak no matter how hard you train.\"\nIt wasn't a consolation.\n\"Kuaa…\"\nThe man on his knee let out occasional groans.\n\"I was going to kill you here, but consider yourself lucky.\"\n\"Lord… Lord, thank you.\"\nHe was really grateful. He was scared of losing his life.\n\"Fix this shit right now.\"\n\"Yes.\"\nThe kneeling man got up.\nAs he got up, his face revealed his identity, the chairman of Ohshin group, Mun Il-hyang.\nThe power he showed in the VR meeting was nowhere to be seen, his eyes full of fear now.\nAs Mun Il-hyang left the office, the man sitting at the desk called someone.\n\"Kyle.\"\nShhh!\nSomeone appeared from the other side. And as he came close, his face was full of scars.\n\"Yes. Lord\"\n\"Find Deo. And kill him.\"\nThe man pointed to the TV screen which still had sparks.\nOn the TV screen was Chun Yeowun's face, and it was said that he was the hero who prevented the criminal from achieving his goals.\n\"As my Lord wishes.\"\nShhh!\nThe figure of the one called Kyle seeped back into the shadows.\nChengdu city, deep mountain valley within the walls.\nThere was a hut hidden in a sparsely populated place.\nIt looked like an ordinary two-storey place from outside, but when entered, it was a large scale facility with up to 10 floors built underground.\nThe 8th basement floor of the lodge was a space equipped with various medical equipment like a hospital.\nIn the large hospital room, was a person with dark blue hair and wrinkled skin. He was in a wheelchair with numerous things inserted all over his body.\n'How!'\nBang!\nThere was a person next to him who couldn't contain his anger, and that was the chairman of Blade Six Geum Song-ryong.\nHe was stunned when he saw the news on the wall TV.\nUnbeknownst to him, the news reported that he was the one who murdered the bailiffs of the judicial Prison and accused him of killing the Ministry of Murim and the other Murim Association executives.\n\"At a time like this!\"\nThis wasn't a good situation. His business trip to Chengdy was confidential. And in a way, this was the perfect timing to frame him.\n'At this point, all the images I tried to build up about me will collapse.'\nHow long did it take for the Blade God Six Martial clan to rise?\nAll that hard work was ruined by this one incident.\nAn old man full of wrinkles, who was staring at the TV with blank eyes like a dying person, suddenly smiled.\n\"Hehehe.\"\nGeum Song-ryong who was flustered asked.\n\"Elderly?\"\nThe Blade God Six Martial clan was in a crisis, so why was this old man laughing?\nThe old man, who continued to laugh like a mad man, suddenly stopped. And then, tremendous energy burst out from his body.\nWooong!\nIt was hard to believe that he was an old man on the verge of death, the medical tools were beginning to crack.\nCrack! Crash!\nThe energy of the old man was amazing enough to create and destroy life.\n\"Elderly stop! Stop it!\"\nGeum Song-ryong hurriedly stopped him, wondering something bad would happen.\nAnd the energy sweeping through the room stopped.\nThe old man, with his dark blue eyes, mumbled as he looked at Chun Yeowun who was on the TV screen.\n\"It has been long… this long time has been worthwhile.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nThe old man kept saying that as he looked at the TV, and Geum Song-ryong was puzzled.\n\"A revenge opportunity has arisen!\"\nThe conference room of Yongchun Group in Jinan city.\nA sea of tears and joy.\nAll the executives were weeping because of the old man who was in front of them.\nThe old man, Chun Woo-jin, chairman of Black Sky company.\nThe radiant energy he had in the past had disappeared in the face of storms he had faced in the past years of hardships, but it was unchanging that he was the true leader of the Sky Demon Order.\n\"Thank you so much for not forgetting me.\"\nChun Woo-jin expressed his gratitude to the kneeling executives.\nHe was the one who had given up everything and accepted death too. Never had he ever dreamt that such a moment would come.\n\"How can you say that?\"\n\"You should punish us for not finding our Lord earlier than now.\"\nThe executives fell on the floor and pleaded.\nChun Woo-jin smiled at them. He, who had already given up everything, was just content to have come back here.\n\"Father! Please punish me too! I made my father suffer as I couldn't fix the problem within our Cult!\"\nHis son, Chun Yu-jang, also pleaded.\nChun Yu-jang had realized his shortcomings during his time with Chun Yeowun, and realized that it was his fault for not solving the internal division of the Cult sooner.\nHe was ready to be yelled at too.\nBut Chun Woo-jing didn't do that.\n\"No. The absence of your father beside you is what made you suffer, how can I blame you?\"\nChun Woo-jin had been thinking for the past 27 years.\nThe only regret was that if he had been a little smarter and stronger, what happened wouldn't have happened.\n'Ahh… father.'\nIn the past, his father would always shout at him, but seeing his father just back down made Chun Yu-jang's heart tremble.\nHe wanted to see his father act proud and strong.\nAt that moment, Chun Yu-jang looked at him and said.\n\"Since you have come back, please father, lead the Cult again!\"\nAt Chun Yu-jang's words, all the executives fell onto the floor and shouted.\n\"Please lead the Cult!\"\nAt that, Chun Woo-jin shook his head and spoke with a serious face.\n\"No. This old man knows when to step down. My time has passed. No, it is pointless to call it my time. I am an example of failure. Now you will lead this Cult.\"\n\"Father!\"\nOn the way back there, Chun Woo-jin had heard everything which had happened from BI Mak-heon.\nFrom the rebellion of his own brother, Chun Woo-kyung, to his eldest son who wanted to control Chun Ma.\nHaving heard all that, he felt how immoral they were.\nJudging that he hadn't accomplished anything when he was the Lord, he considered that it was futile to assume that position any longer.\n\"How can you say that? No one will have any objection to father leading the Cult again!\"\n\"Yes. Lord!\"\nThe executives nodded their heads at Chun Yu-jang's words.\n\"Huh, I have made up my heart. I've already been weakened 27 years ago when my Dantian was broken. How can I even lead the Cult again?\"\nWith those words, Chun Woo-jin knelt down and spoke to Chun Yeowun who was sitting at the top of the table watching them all.\n\"If my ancestor allows it, I would like to pass down the position of Lord to my son, who is a younger Lord.\"\nAfter all, he had no more right to be a Lord.\nHow could an old man come back and hope to perform martial arts like the past?\nHe thought that Chun Yeowun, the Chun Ma, would understand and allow it.\n\"I can't allow it.\"\nFlat out refusal.\n\"W-why?\"\nTo those who were shocked, Chun Yeowun shook his head and spoke.\n\"You are thinking about taking a break without paying the price for making the Cult in such a state.\"\n\"N-no that isn't it! I put the Cult in a crisis, and have no qualification or power to lead the Cult…\"\nChun Yeowun cut off Chun Woo-jin's words.\n\"If that is the excuse you want to use, then I will restore the martial arts you lost.\"\n\"Huh? Wha-what do you mean?\"\nChun Yeowun spoke casually to Chun Woo-jin who was surprised.\n\"I said I will restore your martial arts.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 114: Shadow Assassin (1)\n27 years ago.\nWhen Chun Woo-jin was imprisoned in a secret prison, his Dantian was destroyed.\nAs one of the Five Great Warriors, he thought that he could restore his martial arts at a later time, but that didn't happen.\nThey had even blocked the flow of energy into his blood.\n'Restore my martial arts?'\nHe had already given up on such a dream.\nArriving at the Yongchun Group headquarters, he tried to restore his Dantian by using a cultivation method, but that didn't work.\nIt had been so long since his Dantian was destroyed that recovering it seemed impossible.\n'I thought I accepted my fate.'\nChun Woo-jin's eyes tinged with hope as he sat cross-legged.\nThe place where he was sitting was the training room of the chairman of the Yongchun Group.\nHis heart trembled.\n'Can I do martial arts again?'\nMurim warriors would achieve the greatest happiness and satisfaction when they gained a sense of accomplishment. And their most desperate time would be when they lose their swords.\nAs soon as he felt hope, which could be called the root of martial arts, his eyes lit up.\n\"You must be ready.\"\nChun Yeowun approached him.\nChun Woo-jin gulped and answered.\n\"Yes.\"\nAlthough he had the face of a 76 years old man, his heart was beating like a teenager. Seeing that, Chun Yeowun smiled. It was because he could empathize with his feelings.\n'I hope I succeed.'\nIt was Chun Yeowun's first time restoring someone's lost Dantian.\nThis was something he had realized after reaching Heavenly Master level, but there was one person he wanted to rush to and heal their Dantian.\n'Escort Jang.'\nThe man who took care of Chun Yeowun since he was young. Chun Yeowun always felt bad for Escort Jang, who lost his Dantian as he fell into the trap of another clan, a rival clan seeking power.\n'It is possible now.'\nChun Yeowun put his palm on the old man's Dantian.\nChun Yeowun spoke to him, who was nervous.\n\"It will be very painful.\"\n“… I am used to pain. Huhuhu.”\nChun Woo-jin responded with a huge smile. He had never stayed still in the prison. Yet, he was a man of patience.\n\"Then I am glad.\"\nWoong!\nAs soon as he said that, Chun Yeowun drew energy from the nature around him.\nChun Woo-jin, who lost his skills, couldn't feel a single thing, but.\n'What is this? The surrounding energy is rapidly increasing.'\nIn the present era, the energy of nature has remarkably faded.\nDue to that, Murim warriors had to gather devices able to provide them with energy.\nHowever, clear energy was gathering in the training room.\n'Use me as a medium.'\nThe energy of nature condensed into Chun Yeowun's body.\nAt the same time, the energy which was in Chun Yeowun, soon moved to the palm on Chun Woo-jin's Dantian.\n\"Eck!\"\nAn exclamation left Chun Woo-jin's mouth. The energy he felt after a long time was now filling his Dantian.\nWhat was even more surprising was that this energy was so pure that it couldn't be compared to the devices they had.\n\"It will be hard to endure from now.\"\n\"It is fine.\"\n\"Good.\"\nA red light began to shine from Chun Yeowun's palm. Nano's scan function controlled the energy of nature while seeing the condition inside the body.\n'The place where the Dantian had been completely shattered is stiff. It's been so long since he was hit.'\nThis wasn't a problem that couldn't be recovered by a Nano.\nChun Yeowun concentrated the energy of nature in that spot.\nWoong!\nThen, the energy of nature fathered in the centre of Dantian.\nIn doing so, the stiff things were destroyed.\n\"Ack!\"\nA groan erupted from Chun Woo-jin's mouth.\nIt was as if the pain of destroying the Dantian was being relayed.\nAnd this was just the beginning.\nWhen Chun Yeowun waved his hand, the energy of nature gathered around him and turned into a small sphere.\n\"I will break through the blocked vessels.\"\nShhh!\nWhen Chun Yeowun moved his hand, a small energy sphere condensed into his body.\nGreat pain took over him.\n\"Kuaak!\"\nChun Woo-jin clenched his teeth. Even though it was painful enough to turn him pale, he preserved.\n'He is pretty stubborn.'\nChun Yeowun thought that the man wouldn't be able to stand it, but he was shocked.\nIt certainly made no sense considering his age.\n'Father.'\nChun Yu-jang looked through the window of the training room in sweat. It was about an hour after it started.\n'This much should be enough.'\nChun Woo-jin's body adapted to the energy.\nAnd the Dantian created by the energy of nature, was done.\nChun Yeowun pulled out a small bottle from his pocket.\n'Blood of Qilin.'\nWhat was inside the bottle was a few drops of the Blood of Qilin.\nOnce Mun Ran-yeong had recovered, Chun Yeowun had taken back the bottle.\nBecause he knew how crucial even a single drop of that blood was.\n\"Haha… sigh…\"\nChun Yoewun looked at Chun Woo-jin who was sighing while drenched in sweat.\nHe opened his mouth and poured three drops in.\n\"Gulp and cultivate it. From now on, you need to handle it.\"\nSince the vessels were opened, the energy couldn't be blocked anymore.\nAnd he could recover his Dantian if he could cultivate the energy he received from the Blood of Qilin.\nThere was only one thing Chun Yeowun could do now.\nIt was to control the flame generated by the Qilin with his Ice qi.\n\"Kuaaak!\"\nIt was only three drops, but heat still surged from Chun Woo-jin's body.\nBecause his internal energy was close to non-existence, he wouldn't be able to handle the three drops by himself.\nThe entire room began to freeze.\n\"Uh?\"\nEven the windows were fogged.\nDue to that, Chun Yu-jang, who was watching from outside, had no choice but to turn impatient.\nAnd two more hours passed.\nJjkk!\nThe door to the training room opened.\nFrom there, Chun Yeowun appeared, his whole body covered in ice. Chun Yu-jang, who hadn't moved a single step, asked.\n\"Ancestor. How did it go?\"\n\"Look by yourself.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nAt that moment, someone walked out from inside the training room, with steam exuding from his body.\nChun Yu-jang, who saw that, turned teary-eyed.\n'No… No way…'\nHe never dreamed that he could see this again. Just three hours ago, his father was nothing but a fragile old man in his 70s, and now, he was back to the way he was before the arrest.\nFrom the outside, he looked like a middle-aged man in his 40s.\n\"Fa-father!\"\nLooking at the flowing energy, Chun Yu-jang could tell that the Dantian was recovered.\nChun Woo-jin was also unable to hide his joy. A wide smile was drawn on his face.\n\"Ancestor!\"\nChun Woo-jin knelt down in front of Chun Yeowun.\nHe never thought that he could recover his Dantian and do martial arts again, but he didn't just recover the Dantian, but his body was back to its peak again.\nHe could feel it from the firmer skin.\n\"I don't know how to repay this favor…\"\nChun Yeowun said to him.\n\"If you want to repay the favor, you need to restore the prestige of the Cult after fully recovering.\"\n\"Ahhh!\"\nHe recovered his Dantian, and his body was back to normal.\nBut he still had to get used to the new body.\nChun Yeowun had forcibly returned the body into a prior state with the help of the energy of nature, but the muscles were still in a degenerated state, which now required training.\nBanging the head on the floor, Chun Woo-jin said,\n\"I will recover as soon as possible and correct everything!\"\nThis was something that would be solved with hard work and time. Chun Yu-jang was at a loss of words at his father's confident words.\n'To restore him back to his state 27 years ago… is this what the second generation Chun Ma truly means?'\nHe couldn't help but be amazed at the endless abilities of Chun Yeowun. He wondered if anything was impossible for him.\nChun Yeowun asked Chun Yu-jang.\n\"Is it done?\"\n\"Ah! The core refining machine?\"\nThe installation was delayed as it took several days to retrieve the trucks which were on the way to the Murim Association. But now they could use it.\n\"Was it in the Sector 4 factory?\"\n\"Yes. Right.\"\n\"Let's go. I need to take a look.\"\n\"Huh? Ancestor. You must be exhausted after everything you did today, shouldn't you rest?\"\nChun Yu-jang, who was outside the training room, felt how huge of an energy was flowing inside. It was too much, and he knew that such energy won't replenish right away.\nChun Woo-jin also agreed,\n\"Yu-jang is right. If it isn't urgent, it is better to res…\"\n\"No need.\"\nChun Yeowun immediately refused.\nHe understood their worries, but Chun Yeowun didn't really use his energy.\nAll he did was act as a medium for the energy from nature. He was mentally exhausted. That was all.\n'Huh…'\nNot knowing that, Chun Woo-jin and Chun Yu-jang felt bad.\nOne of the office buildings of Yongchun Group.\nThere was a hidden prison in the basement. In the prison was an exotic handsome man with long brown hair and a pointed nose in a chair with a dissatisfied face.\nHe was the Demon Deo, who was defeated by Chun Yeowun.\n'Tch.'\nHow many times had he fainted in his life? After completing Chun Yeowun's order, he was able to get the heart sword embedded inside the core once he arrived here.\nAs he was through so much for a long time, he felt stunned the entire day.\n\"This… is a prison?\"\n\"Hh. Right.\"\nIt was Chun Yeowun's second secretary Shakena, who grunted out outside the prison cell.\nUpon waking up, she sensed that he had awakened his energy and came to the place.\nAnd feeling that this was absurd, Deo said.\n\"I surrendered. Why am I inside here and you out?\"\n\"I don't know. Master told me to lock you up till you wake up.\"\nDeo clicked his tongue at Shakena's bright words.\n\"Tch tch, the heart hunter's reputations seem to have run out, working for humans.\"\nTheir clan considered humans worms. An insect that moved and died.\nTo surrender to such a being and swear allegiance to it!\n\"Master is different from other humans. You must have experienced it too.\"\nDeo sighed in relief at Shakena's words. Clearly this person was different.\n\"… is he really human? The clan has been sending people to this planet for a long time, but this is the first time I've seen such strength.\"\n\"Huh. You say that when you only lived for 400 years.\"\nTheir average lifespan was not the same as humans. With a body structure that increases life as they get stronger, the number of years they can live is over 1,000 if they were above Marquis.\n\"Four hundreds is long enough. You haven't been here for long so you don't know, but humans live less than a hundred. Looking at his face, he is less than 1/5th of that. I don't understand it.\"\n\"Really? I heard from a human called BI Mak-heon that he lived for over a thousand years?\"\n\"What? Thousand years? Is he really human?\"\nDeo couldn't believe the word 'thousand years'.\nIt was a misunderstanding on Shakena's side, but Deo was convinced.\n'… well, if he is that strong, living for a thousand years makes sense. He wouldn't lose to me, who has been here for just 20 years.'\nShakena asked him as he was thinking.\n\"By the way, what happened to you? Did you find the traitor?\"\nDeo, who hesitated for a moment, nodded his head.\nNot understanding what he meant, Shakena asked.\n\"And you are fine?\"\nIt was definite that if they met the traitor, they would have a desperate fight. One side would be able to run away, and the other would aim for the throat of their king.\nBut Deo only frowned.\nSmiling, Shakena said.\n\"You… lost.\"\nThe proud Deo had no reason to stay silent. And she continued.\n\"You were defeated, but survived because the traitor gave you the chance.\"\nFrom the standpoint of a traitor who preyed on his own people, there was no reason to keep Deo alive.\nUnless, he surrendered and swore allegiance.\n\"Yes, you swore to surrender to humans!\"\n\"But it isn't breaking the clan's law!\"\nThe predation of their kind was a taboo. Killing was fine, but only under the command of their king. However, Deo violated it and surrendered to a traitor.\n\"What a shame! I don't think you deserve the Count title.\"\n\"Don't talk like that. If you saw him 4 years back, you would have changed your mind.\"\n\"Him?\"\nShakena's eyes narrowed at that. Deo spoke as if he didn't care.\n\"Right. He… he is no longer in a position to be called a traitor.\"\n\"What was that now? Not on a level to be called a traitor?\"\n\"He has grown so strong that he no longer needs to form his own clan.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"What do you think is the reason for him to keep me, a Count, alive?\"\nIt was then.\nPuck!\n\"Kuak!\"\nA black shadow pierced its hand into Deo's chest.\nIn his head was the core, which could be called the heart of Deo.\n\"T… this…\"\nDeo was startled at it. From the shadow behind him, an exotic looking man with a face full of scars and a bulging body was there.\n\"K-Kyle!\"\nDeo recognized him and called his name.\nAt that, Kyle said.\n\"He told me to bring you in, but you are leaking information to the bugs.\"\n\"You!\"\nShakena, who recognized Kyle's presence, called out to him in a voice mixed with anger, and phased herself to enter the prison.\nAt that moment, Kyle's body went back into the shadows.\nSwoosh!\nShakena looked around with narrowed eyes. She tried to sense the demonic energy again, but she couldn't feel a thing.\nAnd Deo, who was running out of time, said to her.\n\"N… No use. Run away.\"\n\"What are you saying!\"\n\"Un… Unlike me… the ones… below him…. are… strong.\"\nThud!\nDeo's neck went limp.\n\"Yah! Wake up! If you die, I will be scolded by Master!\"\nSwosh!\nAt that moment, a black shadow created sharp thorns on the prison floor, trying to kill her.\nIt happened in a fraction of a second, but Shakena phased it.\nWoong!\nIn that state, she reached to the floor. Purple energy began to rise around her in the form of spheres and crashed to the floor.\nKwakwakwang!\nNumerous holes were drilled into the floor, and the lower floor was visible. However, the one who attacked her wasn't seen.\n'Where the hell is he?'\nShakena was now serious.\nShe knew the demon called Kyle.\nAs a Count class demon, he was far lower than her rank, and in the past, he wasn't so good at hiding his energy either, so his presence was always revealed.\n'I don't feel any energy!'\nBut now, she couldn't feel it. Even when he appeared from the shadow, she only knew it after he made a sound.\nShakena yelled!\n\"Where are you? Kyle! Don hide and come out to fight!\"\nHer cry echoed in the building. But Kyle didn't show up. Shakena continued to move around, trying to find any trail.\nIt was then,\nSwosh!\nAt the sound ringing in her ears, Shakena used Phasing. Suddenly, a black shadow passed through her chest. A little late, and it would have caught her.\n\"You bastard!\"\nAnnoyed, Shakena clicked her tongue. In that brief moment, Kyle's shadow seeped back into the shadows again.\n\"Annoying!\"\nThe fight was troublesome because his ability was more perfect than before.\nAnd Kyle's gloomy voice could be heard by Shakena.\n\"With the powers we both have, this fight will keep going on. Give up. Heart Hunter.\"\n\"There you are!\"\nShakena fired an energy sphere at the location of the sound.\nSwosh! Bang!\nThe sphere broke the wall.\n\"You bastard!\"\nKyle's voice came out from another direction.\n\"I will give you a chance as you are a member of the same clan.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"If you surrender and kill the human called Chun Mu-seong with me. I will give you the honor of working for him.\"\nShakena yelled out as if the offer was absurd.\n\"Fuck that shit! You think you can go against my master!\"\nShhh!\nThen, Kyle's head was out from the ceiling.\nWith a laugh, he said.\n\"Kuak, a human is your master? The Heart Hunter is a mere pet for a human! Hahaha! Humans can be killed at any time…\"\nEven before he was done,\n\"What are you, and what are you doing here?\"\nKyle frowned at the voice which came from elsewhere. Unlike him, Shakena smiled and called.\n\"Master!\"\n\"Master?\"\nThe moment Kyle wondered.\nBang!\nA hand pierced the ceiling and grabbed his head.\n\"Ugh?\"\nKyle, whose head was caught, tried to seep back into the shadows, but the unbelievable energy around him suppressed him, and his body was dragged out.\nKwakwang!\n\"Kuaaaak!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 115: Shadow Assassin (2)\n\"Kuak!\"\nKyle was dragged up as he bumped into some ceiling fragments.\nHe looked at the young man with a fair face and sharp eyes who grabbed his head.\n'This one?'\nIt was Chun Yeowun that he saw on the TV screen.\nKyle didn't expect this man to be found so quickly, this wasn't how things were supposed to go.\nThe headquarters area of the Yongchun group was huge and had spacious buildings, so he didn't think that anyone would be able to notice a battle.\nChun Yeowun's energy was so great that it covered the whole Yongchun group area.\n\"You sneaked in like a rat.\"\nHe did say that, but Chun Yeowun's intentions were different.\n'The response was faster than I thought.'\nHe knew that the enemies would try to deal with him, but he didn't expect them to do so right away.\nHolding Kyle's head, he asked.\n\"You are a demon too?\"\nA scarred face, but an exotic appearance.\nA unique energy utterly different from internal energy.\n'Does he know how to hide his energy?'\nIf he wasn't right next to him, feeling the energy would've been hard.\nMeanwhile, Kyle said.\n\"You seem to be aware of our existence, Chun Mu-seong.\"\nHe knew Chun Yeowun by his pseudonym. And no matter how much he heard it, Chun Yeowun couldn't get used to it.\n\"I came to look for you, but you came by yourself!\"\nShh!\nKyle, who was being held by his head, kicked Chun Yeowun's neck.\nChun Yeowun raised his hand to block it.\nPak!\nIt was a light kick, but the power it held was beyond normal.\nKwang!\nIt was so strong that the force from the kick extended to the other side, and the wall of the building was ripped open.\nIt was evening, so it was dark outside.\n'He stopped the kick?'\nKyle's eyes shuddered.\nHis goal was to kill Chun Yeowun, so he kicked him with all his might.\n\"You are a little stronger than Shakena.\"\nThat was Chun Yeowun's evaluation, he was better than Shakena, who ate the hearts of Murims.\nThe fact that his kick was this strong meant he ate a lot more than Shakena.\n\"And that's about it.\"\nWhoo!\nFeeling enraged at being compared with Shakena, Kyle stretched out his left hand.\n\"How long are you planning on holding my head! Cheeky humans!\"\nHis hands were now dyed in black and had the shape of a sharp weapon.\nThey aimed at Chun Yeowun's chest.\nGrab!\nChun Yeowun caught the hand. But Kyle's lips twitched.\n\"Caught you!\"\nSwosh!\nAt that moment, the shadow hand trembled like a liquid and then covered Chun Yeowun's left arm till the elbow.\n\"No matter how strong you are, you are still a human.\"\nThe shadow moved around trying to constrain Chun Yeowun's movements. This was different from physical restraint.\nSince the hand was already touched by the shadow, it was now in the shadow realm.\nSwosh!\n\"Hm?\"\nChun Yeowun moved his hand, but it felt like something was sucking it back.\nHe tried to use his full energy, but the part covered in shadow didn't move.\nIn the meantime, the shadow kept creeping a little further.\n\"Useless. Unless you are in the shadow realm, It is impossible to get out of the shadows! Get this shitty hand away from me!\"\nKyle pretended to grab something.\nAt his gesture, the shadows from the walls changed into thorns and rushed for Chun Yeowun.\nSwosh!\nChun Yeowun brought out a curtain of energy to block it, but the shadow passed through the barrier.\nSwoosh!\n\"Did you think you could stop the shadows like that! Die now!\"\nKyle seemed elated.\n\"Really? Then I guess there is nothing to do.\"\n\"What?\"\nChun Yeowun gave strength into the hand holding Kyle's head.\nClench!\nHis fingers dug into Kyle's head.\n\"Ackkkk!\"\nKyle, who was suffering from tremendous pain, groaned out loud, yet the shadow thorns didn't stop.\n'Going ahead even if it means sacrificing yourself?'\nAs the opponent seemed to be stronger than expected, Chun Yeowun's punishment turned more gruesome.\nCrack!\nKyle's head was smashed.\nBlack smoke flowed from the head, bloodless. He tried to keep him alive to get information, but since things took an unexpected route, he had to kill the demon.\nThud!\nKyle's body fell to the ground. In the gap, something purple and opaque was grabbed by Chun Yeowun.\nIt was a round core.\n\"Master, Count Deo's core is safe!\"\nThud! Thud! Thud!\nTo her surprise, the core in his hand was beating.\n\"Hm?\"\n\"Our clan can survive as long as the core isn't destroyed.\"\nShakena explained to Chun Yeowun who was puzzled.\nHe thought that he lost all means to get information, but thanks to her, it seemed like Deo could be saved.\nHowever, something was weird.\n'If the core isn't destroyed, then they live?'\nThat feeling was right.\nSwoosh!\nThe shadows on his hand hadn't disappeared yet. Rather, they were still climbing up his body.\n'This…'\nChun Yeowun looked at Kyle, who had fallen on the floor. But the body was nowhere to be seen. It had already seeped into the shadows.\n'He was still alive?'\nChun Yeowun frowned. He smashed the head, but he was still alive?\nAt that moment, Shakena shouted.\n\"Master! He is running away!\"\nFortunately, as the head was shattered, he couldn't hide the energy, so Shakena could sense his location.\nBreaking through the wall, she moved. And Chun Yeowun followed her.\nWoong!\nWhen they went out, there seemed to be quite a lot of cultists.\nThey had come to see what the commotion was about.\nPak!\n\"Ah! We greet Chun Ma!\"\nThe cultists who looked at Chun Yeowun, bowed to him.\n'This!'\nThe timing was right. So Shakena threw an energy sphere at the members.\nShh! Bang!\n\"Tch!\"\nShe kept firing spheres in succession at the members.\nThe people who were startled by her acts, moved away.\nHowever, the black shadow which protruded from the floor like tentacles, immediately attacked around 30 cultists.\nSwosh!\n\"W-what is this?\"\n\"Tentacle?\"\nClang!\nThe bewildered cultists pulled out their weapons and raised sword energy to cut it off. But it was like cutting a shadow.\nHowever, the shadow tentacles soon gathered and aimed for the gaps in the weapons.\nPak!\n\"Euk!\"\nThe body of a person touched by the shadow was engulfed fully this time. As if the entire body was eaten by shadow.\n\"Avoid! Everyone move!\"\nSurprised by it, they immediately moved to different places.\nHowever, the fact that it was evening made the shadows the worst ability to fight against.\nDemon Kyle's powers were at their peak.\nRumble!\nThe tentacles from the wide floor rose dozens of meters in length, and tried to swallow up all the people around in an instant.\n\"Oh my!\"\n\"M-My body!\"\nSome cultists couldn't avoid being eaten by the shadow. But that wasn't the problem.\n\"Huh?\"\nThose who were eaten by the shadows turned black and rushed for Chun Yeowun and Shakena.\nPhat!\nTheir physical abilities were beyond human limits. Chun Yeowun and Shakena were now in the air, about three stories high, yet the human shadows jumped up at once and attacked them.\nSince they were cultists, Chun Yeowun avoided them, but Shakena hit them without hesitation.\nPuck!\nA shadow man hit by Shakena's kick was thrown away.\nHowever, as if not hurt, the shadow got up and jumped up again.\n\"Stubborn!\"\nShakena created an energy sphere ready to kill.\n\"Don't kill them!\"\nAt Chun Yeowun's shout, she didn't fire it. Meanwhile, a black shadow fell over her.\nShh!\nOf course, with her phasing, it passed through her. But in that brief moment, Shakena discovered something.\nDrop! Drop!\nDrops of blood were dripping down the black shadow's face.\nAs they were suddenly engulfed in the shadows and were being manipulated, they seemed to be shocked.\n\"Master! The members seem to be in pain.\"\n\"I see that.\"\nTheir concern was right.\nThe one called Kyle was using the cultists as hostages. A mouth appeared on the face of the shadow man and said.\n\"Kuku! Attack me all you want. That is if you want to kill your subordinates.\"\nAt those words, Chun Yeowun's eyes turned cold. Without noticing that, Kyle continued.\n\"At night I am invincible. I am not someone you bastard can handle!\"\n\"Shakena, where is he?\"\nChun Yeowun ignored his words and asked Shakena.\nAnd she pointed to a direction in the west.\n\"Over there!\"\nAt that, Chun Yeowun swung a sword on his right hand.\nAt that, five invisible swords appeared in the air, and with great speed they went to the place where she pointed.\nPuck!\nChun Yeowun frowned as he couldn't feel like he had hit something. At that moment, 6 shadow men jumped up and rushed for him. The six of them spoke at once.\n\"Are you trying to kill us?\"\n\"You are being so annoying.\"\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun held onto a sword he created and then lowered his palm. And the shadow humans which were floating up went flat to the ground.\nThud! Thud!\nThe shadow humans were stuck to the floor, unable to move like before.\nThey were still humans, so internal energy worked on them.\n\"These low level tricks don't work on me. Demon.\"\nAt Chun Yeowun's words, a mouth formed in the shadows and smiled.\n\"I see. But there seem to be three hundred more humans in this place. Can you protect all of them?\"\nKyle spoke as if he held all the people in the Yongchun group under his control. Since he couldn't deal with Chun Yeowun, he took this method. And it didn't sit well with Chun Yeowun.\n\"You… there is no need to keep you alive.\"\n\"Ah. It seems like you are misunderstanding something about who has the upper hand here. Rather, you should be concerned about your human body.\"\nAt some point, the shadow had engulfed Chun Yeowun entire left arm. Since Chun Yeowun was strong, the shadow couldn't move like usual.\nShhh!\n\"At the moment I completely have control of you, I'll kill all your people right in front of you.\"\nThe shadow was slowly moving to Chun Yeowun's shoulder when it suddenly began to crack.\nJjjkkk\n'!?'\nKyle, who was hiding in the shadows, couldn't hide his shock as he saw that.\nThe shadow was nothing more than a two-dimensional gateway.\nOnce sucked, there was no way out.\nBut this was odd.\n\"You are going to tie me with this?\"\nPang!\nThe shadow completely collapsed and Chun Yeowun's arm was revealed.\nChun Yeowun's left hand, which had a sword in it, had a dark energy rising from it.\n'No! did he destroy the shadow realm?'\nThe shadow realm was where he wanted to imprison Chun Yeowun. But the ferocious energy from the sword destroyed it.\n'Is he really human?'\nIt was the first time anyone escaped from the shadows.\nChun Yeowun smiled and said.\n\"There are places you cannot touch.\"\n\"What?\"\nThe place where Chun Yeowun was looking at was Yongchun Group's lamps.\nSome of the members who escaped from the shadows had gone over to the lamps and light posts.\n\"Weak to light.\"\nKyle's only weakness. If the shadows were limited by light, then the power of shadows cannot be used properly.\n\"Huh! So what? Do you think those streetlights would protect all of them?\"\nSwosh!\nAt that moment, a thorn of shadows rose from the dark side of the ground and hit all the streetlights.\nIn the meantime, the other Cult members were rushing out of the buildings.\nAs the battle kept happening, more people began to come.\n\"If I can't kill you, then I will kill everyone under you first!\"\nRumble!\nIn a radius of ten meters, shadow tentacles jumped out reaching for the people who were coming out.\nIt was then.\nChun Yeowun stretched out his hand.\n\"No us…\"\nWheik!\nAn unbelievable thing happened.\nThousands of swords in flame filled the entire air around them.\n\"T-this is…\"\n\"The sky!\"\nThe Cult members were shocked at what they were seeing. The site of the Yongchun Group was as bright as day thanks to the Flame qi swords.\n'This… insane…'\nKyle, who looked up from the shadows, was at a loss of words.\nDue to the blazing swords, it became difficult to use shadows.\nHe never imagined that this would be possible. It was then.\n\"That's where you are?\"\nPuck!\nSomething came in, grabbed him by the neck and pulled him out.\nGrab!\nKyle, who was pulled out, was wide eyed.\n\"H-How can a human have such… power…\"\nCreepy!\nThe moment his eyes met Chun Yeowun's, his face turned pale.\nA great void that seemed to destroy everything was imprisoning him.\nKyle, who lost confidence, lost his will to battle.\n'Th… this one… isn't someone… I can… handle.'\nHurriedly, he shouted.\n\"I-I surrender! I, Count Kyle, will swear allegiance to you, a great warrior, so spear my lif…\"\nPuck!\nBefore he could even finish, Chun Yeowun's had dug into Kyle's chest.\n\"Kuak!\"\nThud! Thud! Thud!\nChun Yeowun held onto the core. Kyle's eyes were drenched in fear as he saw that his life source was captured.\n\"P-Please have mercy on me…\"\n\"Mercy? If you wanted that, you shouldn't have provoked me. And…\"\nCreepy!\nSuddenly, a gloomy energy erupted around. And a blue light appeared in Chun Yeowun's eyes.\n'W-what is this?'\nChun Yeowun spoke to Kyle who was bewildered.\n\"Do I really need to save and use a guy like you?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 116: Shadow Assassin (3)\nChun Yeowun used Ghost energy.\nA weird and demonic eerie energy came out of his wrist guard which was on his right wrist and entered Kyle’s core. Kyle’s body trembled at the gloomy energy which entered his body.\n‘Huh?’\nHowever, it was strange.\nNaturally, Chun Yeowun thought that the skin would change and lose its vitality. But nothing like that happened to Kyle.\n‘What?’\nUnlike the human body, Kyle, a demon, had no vitality inside his body.\nWithout blood and vitality, the body was filled with something called demonic energy, which was different from vitality.\n‘Unique.’\nAs the demon didn’t lose its body or erode, there was no way to turn it into a Ghost.\nAnd then, something unexpected happened.\nWoong!\nOnce again, the Sky Demon Sword came out and resonated. Kyle’s core which he had turned into liquid was soon absorbed into the sword.\nChun Yeowun pulled out the hand.\nWoong!\nAs the Sky Demon Sword resonated, the core trembled.\nThen it turned into a black liquid entirely and entered the sword.\nShhh!\nAt the same time, something entered into Chun Yeowun’s mind.\nChun Yeowun’s eyes turned black and his body went stiff.\nThe father and son, Chun Woo-jin and Chun Yu-jang, who arrived then, went closer.\n“Ancestor?”\n“What happened?”\nChun Yu-jang asked Shakena who was guarding Chun Yeowun.\nHowever, she shook her head as if to say she knew nothing.\n“Who is this person, and what was he doing here?”\nChun Woo-jin went close to Kyle in front of Chun Yeowun, and asked with a puzzled expression.\nHe gently touched him with his hand.\nShhh!\n“Huh!”\nBlack smoke suddenly rose from his body and quickly collapsed down into ashes.\n“T-The body is!”\nChun Woo-jin and Chun Yu-jang couldn’t hide their shock. Only after hearing from Shakena did they know that Kyle wasn’t a human but something from the Gate.\n‘Huh. Special entity.’\nThey couldn’t help but be shocked that a special entity, which they all heard about only in rumors, had infiltrated the Yongchun group.\nNot too long after that, Chun Yeowun’s eyes were back to normal.\nChun Yu-jang, who sensed the change in Chun Yeowun, asked.\n“Ancestor, are you alright?”\nDespite his question, Chun Yeowun looked at the Sky Demon Sword in his hand, unable to understand.\n‘What are you? Sky Demon Sword.’\nFrom what he knew, the sword was made from a meteorite that fell from the sky.\nBut more, he wanted to know more about the sword.\nChun Yeowun reached out to somewhere, and the black cold iron wrist guard resonated.\nShhhh!\nAt that moment, shadows rose like thorns from the dark places.\n“Master… that ability is?”\nShakena asked with trembling eyes.\nIt was the ability to control shadows.\nSurprisingly, Chun Yeowun was now able to use the powers of Kyle.\nAt the same time.\nA gorgeous office room on the top floor of a tall building in Gwangju.\nThere was a person biting a cigar while looking outside the window of the dark office.\nThe night view was clear.\nA silver-haired woman appeared inside with a glass of red wine in her hands.\nThe woman offered the wine glass to the other person and gently hugged him from the back.\nEyes full of awe rather than affection for the supposed lover.\nIt was then.\nGrab!\nThe wine glass was shattered.\nSurprised, the silver-haired woman asked.\n“What is it? My king.”\nAt her question, the black form muttered in an angry voice.\n“Kyle is dead.”\n“Sorry?”\nThe silver-haired woman couldn’t understand it.\n“Kyle is dead? Did the clan send someone above Marquis?”\nNo one could kill Kyle unless they were from the clan and with a higher title.\nAnd among humans, she was certain that there was no one who could touch Kyle.\nIf there had to be one, then only the ones they raised could do this.\n“No.”\n“Then who the hell could?”\nIn response to her, the black form spat out a name.\n“Chun Mu-seong!”\nAnother name for Chun Yeowun.\nSurprisingly, as soon as Kyle’s body fell, the black form noticed the death. He had no idea how this happened.\nThe silver-haired woman frowned, and then opened her mouth.\n“I can’t believe it. How could humans touch our clan?”\n“Well, the unbelievable thing happened.”\nThe black form seemed to have already accepted it.\nBut despite that, the anger didn’t subside.\nWoong!\nA terrifying amount of huge demonic energy was rising from the body.\nThe silver-haired woman, gently stroking his back, said,\n“My king. Then let me go. I will bring the man over here.”\n“You will bring the man?”\n“Yes. I will deal with it so that my King doesn’t feel like this anymore.”\n“Hmm.”\nAs the black form seemed to think, she pushed her huge breasts onto his back and spoke in a whisper.\n“You know my abilities better than anyone.”\nShh!\nShe murmured as she gently ran her fingers across the collar bone of the black form.\n“Because human beings don’t mind dying for pleasure and cannot live without it.”\nA strange greed was apparent in her eyes as she said that.\nThe man turned around and grabbed her neck.\nGrab!\n“Kuak!”\n“Clan members died and you want to satisfy your own greed?”\nA red light flickered in the eyes. As if terrified, the silver-haired woman withdrew and trembled.\nLooking at that, the black form smiled and said,\n“Fine. If you can deal with him, I will give you four years to handle your powers.”\nOnce the permission fell, the silver-haired woman who had been trembling in fear till a moment ago, looked confident now.\nThree days after that.\nChun Yeowun closed his eyes, as if meditating and organized the shadow ability in his mind.\nThis ability he got was more useful than expected.\nStarting with restraining the opponents through shadows to making them move as he desired, it could also be used as weapons.\nAnd the most useful ability was the shadow realm.\n‘It is as if it is a different space.’\nOnce entered, it would be like a two-dimensional space. The whole space is dark, but infinitely spacious.\nThe advantage of the place was that it could be used as a pocket. He could put and pull things out.\n‘Interesting ability.’\nChun Yeowun spoke as if he liked it, since it was a skill that could be used in various ways.\nA lot of things could be stored there.\nIn addition, if there is something he wants to hide, keeping them inside the shadow realm is easier.\n‘What is its principle?’\nNano couldn’t figure it out either.\nProbably because they were foreign powers different from the ones on earth.\nChun Yeowun can enter this shadow realm and once he entered, he could move at a higher speed.\n‘Body turns a light as a feather.’\nIn the shadow realm, it was possible to move two to three times faster than in the original world.\nThere was no layer of air obstructing him.\nOriginally, Chun Yeowun himself was very fast, but in the shadow realm, he was even quicker.\nUnfortunately, all this was possible only in darkness.\nStill, this seemed enough. Moving between places could be done secretly with this power in the darkness.\nAnd he was quite satisfied.\nRumble!\n“Lord. It seems to have stopped.”\nHe heard Hu Bong’s voice.\nWhen Chun Yeowun opened his eyes, a voice of guidance from the underground train station came out.\n-This train stops in Qingdao. Passengers moving from Qingdao to another area will need to head to another station…\nThe train arrived in Qingdao. A port city in the southern part of Shandong province.\nAs it was close to the sea, there were many beautiful things to see.\nLaoshan was a tourist place.\nWhy did Chun Yeowun come here?\nIt happened a few days ago.\n-You mean from the information agency?\nChun Yeowun asked director Huan Myung-oh, the head of the information agency.\n-Okay. So are clans like the Lower district clan still active?\nLower district clan.\nA representative information-gathering organization 7of the Forces of Evil in Chun Yeowun time.\nA group of thieves, storekeepers, courtesans and brothel women, any place fit to gather information was filled with them.\n-Not there?\n-… from what I know, there are several such groups.\n-Several?\n-Black Athena and Club PAB. But I know that they are dangerous places.\n-Dangerous?\n-I heard that they don’t only sell information, but are also involved in horrible things like drug smuggling.\nGate-related stuff or drug smuggling was considered to be illegal. And it wasn’t right to be tied to them as they were such a crooked group.\n-Lord Chun Ma. it would be better to find the information needed from our information…\n-If possible, sure.\n-What information do you need?\n-MS Group.\nThe information Chun Yeowun wanted was the one related to MS Group.\nThe group disbanded over 15 years ago and was now a ghost organization.\nIf they were doing business with Chun Woo-kyung, then there must be a way to find them.\nAnd there was one reason why Chun Yeowun was looking for MS Group.\nIt was Baekgi.\nNow he turned his attention to Baekgi because the merger went smoothly and he also saved Lord Chun Woo-jin.\nHe also built a nice relationship with the Ministry of National Defense.\n-If it is the MS Group… there may be some clues out there, but we reached a dead end.\nIt was a shameful story. They tried to track MS Group several times under Chun Yeowun’s instructions, but couldn’t find any traces.\n-Which of the two is closer?\n-Black Athena.

      "content": "Chapter 117: Black Athena (1)\nTwo organizations which were acknowledged by Huan Myung-oh, the head of the Sky Demon Order's information office.\nBlack Athena and Club PAB.\nOne of them was Black Athena which was located near Jinan city.\n\"Kuk. Lord. It smells like the sea already, isn't that right? Mak-heon?\"\n\"Y-yes it does.\"\nThey hadn't even left the station yet, so they were still underground. There was no way they could smell the sea from there.\nHu Bong, who was extremely excited, and BI Mak-heon, who treated him like a mentor, were acting like this.\nLooking at them, Yu So-hwa just shook her head.\nOriginally, Lord Chun Woo-jin and Chun Yu-jang asked Chun Yeowun to take more people with him, but he refused.\n[Lord. My wife…]\n[No.]\nHu Bong asked for Mun Ran-yeong to accompany them, but Chun Yeowun was against it.\nAnd the reason was simple.\n[She needs to stay here in case something happens.]\nAlthough the merger went smoothly, there were still enemies waiting for the chance to attack the Sky Demon order.\nThe Murim Association, Blade Six…\nIn addition, the demons who were special entities, were boldly infiltrating their site.\nThat was the reason he wanted to leave behind a strong person.\nSurprisingly, this time Shakena obeyed the orders right away.\n[Guard him at the headquarters.]\nThe person Chun Yeowun asked to be guarded was Deo.\nDemons who lost their core couldn't recover their bodies if it wasn't placed back right away.\nOddly enough, Deo entered into a cocoon state, a state of self-recovering.\n[Don't let anyone touch him.]\n[I understand. Master.]\nAfter seeing Chun Yeowun absorb the energy from the demon core, Shakena acted more cautious.\nMaybe she was scared of having her core coveted by him.\nAnd it didn't seem like a bad outcome for Chun Yeowun who wouldn't have to push her away.\n'If my guess is correct, that traitor demon is among the executives of the Murim Association\n.'\nHe was angry with Chun Yeowun over the incident in the judicial prison and boldly sent his assistants.\nAnd such a person wouldn't give up just because Kyle died.\n'Before that, I need to find clues regarding Baekgi.'\nWith that, Chun Yeowun came here.\nEnemies who realized that he was the centre of the Sky Demon Order were likely to attack him.\nAnd before they earnestly enter war mode, he wanted to find Baekgi.\n\"Vice-chairman. Can we move publicly like this?\"\nAs he was going upstairs, BI Mak-heon asked.\nThe reason was simple.\nWhisper!\nA lot of people were already looking at Chun Yeowun as if they recognized him.\n\"Oh my. Isn't that person the vice-chairman of the Yongchun group who appeared on the news?\"\n\"It's the person who protected the Ministry of National Defense during a case in the judicial prison.\"\nAfter that incident, Chun Yeowun became a celebrity.\nIn a world where gates have opened, the Ministry of National Defense was very important.\nAnd the public thought great of him as he saved a man from that department.\n\"He is the vice-chairman of a large corporation at that age.\"\n\"So cool.!\"\nMost of them were young women.\nChun Yeowun was pretty fine-looking, he was tall and a cold city man vibe was around him.\nHowever, what attracted women the most was that he was the vice-chairman of a large corporation.\n\"They seem to like the Lord very much. Hehe.\"\nMore excited at the gossip of women, Hu Bong spoke to Chun Yeowun.\nHe was now a Supreme master, so he heard everything.\n\"Lord. It might be better to pretend like you don't care.\"\nBi Mak-heon said as he looked at Hu Bong.\nHe really didn't like the attention they were getting.\n\"Worried?\"\n\"I am afraid that those who tried to send assassins would send them again.\"\nTheir location was out. And all sorts of enemies were aiming for Chun Yeowun now.\nChun Yeowun smiled and said to BI Mak-heon.\n\"That is why we are here.\"\n\"What?\"\nRather, that was his goal from the beginning.\nExposing himself was a ruse.\nThe true purpose was to make the enemies' attention turn to him rather than the headquarters of the Yongchun group.\n'I would appreciate it if they aim for me.'\nMeanwhile, the Murim Association in Cheongju had an emergency meeting.\nThey were in utter chaos because of the prison case.\nThe current public opinion was divided into two, clans that wanted to withdraw from the Association and those who wanted to protect their clan members who were trapped.\nMeanwhile, the person behind all that was happening appeared in Cheongju, so they were flustered.\n\"It was said that they moved into town. What should we do?\"\n\"…\"\nAt Kwak Cheon-gi's question, all executives were shocked.\nIt was impossible for them not to remember what happened.\nIn the Murim Association, the demonic Cult was their all-time enemy.\nTheir main enemy was now in their area, so it was right to respond. However, they heard that one of them was stronger than the Five Great Warriors.\nAnd there weren't any decent ones in Cheongju.\n\"Chief. Did you not hear that the one named Chun Mu-seong had destroyed the entire main office? How can we stop him?\"\nWhen one of the executives said that, the others added.\n\"Right. It would only make things worse.\"\n\"It doesn't seem like they are here to mess with us, why not leave them alone?\"\nAt those words, Kwak Cheon-gi seemed troubled.\nLike they said, he was moving openly. They could just watch the man.\nBut he was worried if this was some kind of trap.\n'Is this a trap?'\nGradually, he began to believe that Chun Yeowun was up to something. If not, he couldn't find another excuse.\n'Right. Let this go. Rather, he could be doing this to taunt us too.'\nRight now, the public opinion of the Association wasn't good.\nAnd if they moved and fell into a trap for nothing, it would be even more embarrassing.\n\"Right. If this is a trap, it seems appropriate to just watch them. Let's just inform the people to monitor them and make sure they aren't messing with the city.\"\nEveryone nodded as they agreed to it. But then, a man raised his hand.\n\"Branch chief?\"\nHe was Yeom Hae-kyun, the deputy head of the association and holder of the beer business.\nUnlike his droopy eyes, he was greedy and wasn't the same as the other executives.\n\"The words of the branch chief are right, but what if the Demonic cult came to join hands with the Forces of Evil in Cheongju?\"\n\"Khum.\"\nKwak Cheon-gi coughed as if he didn't like what he just heard.\nHere, in Cheongju, the Forces of Evil were more active than in other cities. They were involved in trade and liquor and were using drugs too.\nBecause of a lot of reasons, the Murim Association couldn't touch them.\n\"What are you trying to say? Deputy chief?\"\nIn response to the question, Yeom Hae-kyun smiled.\n\"I am just saying you know. Use barbarians to deter other barbarians.\"\nIt meant to pit one against another.\n\"We leak the information to the Forces of Evil in advance.\"\n\"Leak information?\"\n\"If the demonic Cult is trying to enter Cheongju… and the person in charge of the group is visiting here. wouldn't they be riled up?\"\nThe executives seemed a little interested in the plan. It seemed plausible too.\nEspecially since it didn't require the Association to use their power.\nIf they could move the Forces of Evil, then the results would be out.\nAnd nothing would happen to the Murim Association.\n'Hmm.'\nKwak Cheon-gi, who thought that Yeom Hae-kyun was aiming for his spot, didn't like this, but agreed to it.\n\"Fine. Let's do that. Then who will handle this?\"\nAt that, Yeom Hae-kyun got up.\n\"Since I was the one who suggested it, I will handle it.\"\nSuddenly, Kwak Cheon-gi felt a weird chill when he saw the man take the lead. But if something went wrong, he could throw the blame on Yeom Hae-kyun.\nOn the other hand, an elevated roar overlooking the sea.\nChun Yeowun and his party members were riding a black sedan down the road.\nA man in his mid-30s wearing a yellow cap was driving the car, he was an agent of the information agency of the Cult.\nHe was ordered to wait for them in front of the station and was now taking them to Black Athena.\nBlack Athena was located in the downtown area on the southeast coast. It was commonly known to be a place of pleasure.\n\"Based on our research, the Black Athena has ranked by trading.\"\nAgent Rayun gave information about Black Athena.\nNot many details were known because they do things secretly, but they managed to gather information from people by telling them they would do business with them.\nTak!\nAgent Rayun, who was driving, pulled something out of his pocket and handed it.\nIt was four coins.\nCoins with an image of Greek goddess Athena holding a spear and shield, one in copper, one in red and the other two in blue.\n\"These coins represent membership of Black Athena.\"\n\"They said that the members are divided into seven types…\"\nWhite for guests.\nBlue is for level 5 trading.\nRed is for level 4 trading.\nCopper is for level 3 trading.\nSilver is for level 2 trading.\nAnd Gold is the first class trading.\nIt was said that black was only owned by the VIP level ones.\nLooking at the coins, Chun Yeowun asked.\n\"Seems like for us, the copper is the highest leveled one of these 4.\"\n\"Sorry. We were running out of time.\"\nChun Yeowun had arrived here in less than half a day.\nIn that time alone, they managed to get information and memberships for them.\n\"It doesn't matter. How to use these?\"\n\"It is said that if you enter the club, which is the main building of Black Athena, there is a large coin design on it. And if the coin is shown there, you are allowed to enter.\"\n\"Hmm.\"\nThe process was simpler than he thought. Since they were mainly doing behind-the-scenes transactions, he thought they would pay more attention to the security, but they seemed rather lax.\n'I'll know once I enter.'\nThe black sedan soon entered the downtown area.\nAs if it was Las Vegas, the place was full of colorful places and filled with entertainment venues worthy of the title city of pleasure!\nKick!\nThe car halted as entry to the place of Black Athena was restricted. And there were so many people on the road that driving it would be tough.\n\"I will be waiting in the public parking lot on the 4th street about 100 meters away.\"\nAfter leaving the car, Chun Yeowun headed to the gates of Black Athena with the others.\nAs it was still around 5 pm, there were huge neon signs lit and EDM music rang out.\nThud! Thud! Thud!\nHu Bong looked at the music ringing out from the speakers and the people entering Black Athena with shocked eyes.\nIn particular, his pupils contracted each time he saw women's breasts revealing through their clothes and thigh-high skirts.\n\"Is this how this place normally is?\"\nChun Yeowun frowned as this was his first time coming here.\nPeople were drinking and dancing, and as they went inside, it felt weirder for them.\n\"Lord. Thank you.\"\n\"For what?\"\n\"Even if I die now, I have no regrets. Hehehe.\"\nHu Bong looked at the women shaking their hips with his red face.\nYu So-hwa, who was next to him, took a photo of his face and said.\nClick!\n\"I'll send it to sister Ran-yeong.\"\n\"Ehh?\"\nHu Bong wondered why she took the photo.\n\"Gasp!\"\nHe had to plead with her after that. This was Hu Bong's only weakness.\nWhen entering the site of Black Athena, the stage was set up outdoors in front of the building and the DJ raised the mood.\nThud! Thud! Thud!\n'Noisy.'\nChun Yeowun never enjoyed music, but listening to this, he missed the music from wind instruments.\nIn this era, he quickly got used to various cultures, but it seemed like this was something he could never understand.\nAnd even more shocking as they went further inside.\nStarting with colorful lasers, artificially created smoke on the ground, and men and women dancing like crazy.\nThud! Thud!\nThe EDm music kept hitting their ears.\nAfter passing the dancing stage and as they went inside, they saw a huge door with goddess Athena under small stairs.\n\"That seems to be the place. Vice-chairman.\"\nIn front of that large door, two large men in black suits were guarding it. Both were martial arts users.\n\"I heard it's sapphire, quite good.\"\nChun Yeowun nodded at Hu Bong's words.\nThese people were only guards, but they were still amazingly skilled.\nHe heard that most of the Forces of Evil had fallen during this time, but seeing these people, that didn't seem right.\nAs Chun Yeowun and his party approached, the large men stopped them.\nAnd said in a daunting voice.\n\"You aren't allowed to go through.\"\nAt that, BI Mak-heon took out a copper coin and showed it to them. There was no need to show lower-level coins. One of the men who checked it, spoke into his earpiece.\n\"There is a copper grade guest. Guide 4 people inside.\"\nAnd then opened the door with a friendly voice, unlike before.\n\"Welcome. Please enter Black Athena.\"\nThe real entrance of Black Athena.\nAs they entered, a beautiful woman in her early 20s was waiting there with her waiter outfit.\nShe was there with four glasses of green martini and red cherries placed to greet them.\n\"I shall guide you.\"\nFollowing her inside, another large hall appeared.\nThe place was well soundproofed, and classical music was playing instead of the EDM outside.\nIt was like entering another world.\n'Silence is so nice.'\nChun Yeowun's expression brightened.\nOn the other hand, Hu Bong's mood darkened. All the people inside were wearing fully covered clothes, this was more like a banquet hall.\nThe large hall had an inner circle for the purpose of the stage, and tables were placed outside the area.\nAs they said that, the beautiful woman who served them left after telling them to have a good time.\n\"… Is this it?\"\n\"We-well. This is different from what we heard!\"\nBi Mak-heon was puzzled.\nThe agent said if they went inside, a person would come to take them. But no one showed up here.\n'Hmm, I need to take a different approach.'\nChun Yeowun knew of a way to meet the needed person directly without this method. But it was a bit extreme this time.\nIt was then, someone approached their table.\n\"You don't know how to use them?\"\nContrary to her pure voice, she was a woman with an alluring figure.\nYu So-hwa's expression went stiff at the woman wearing a red dress showcasing her breasts.\n\"You?\"\n\"It has been long. Probably since the appointment ceremony.\"\nThe two women seemed acquainted.\nThe woman called Im So-hye put her hands on the table, bent her upper body forward so that her breasts were on display for Chun yeowun and said.\n\"I wanted to know the man who made one of the three SS-class keepers retire, and he turns out to be the vice-chairman of the famous Yongchun Group.\"\nHer eyes sparkled with curiosity.\nChun Yeowun asked Yu So-hwa, not interested in the woman at all.\n\"Who is she?\"\nAt that question, Yu So-hwa bit her lip and answered.\n\"… SS-class Kepper Im So-hye.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 118: Black Athena (2)\nSS-class Gate Keepers.\nThere were only 3 of them right now.\nTheir abilities were so great that even A-class Alphas could be taken down by each of them, and each could be called as chaos bringers.\n\"SS-class Gate Keeper?\"\nChun Yeowun's eyes brightened.\nThis meant that the woman in front of him was as strong as Yu So-hwa.\nIt was a rare sight to meet an SS-class Keeper anywhere other than battlegrounds.\n'Hmm.'\nHowever, Yu So-hwa's expression wasn't good.\nShe was staring at the woman with disgust. Im So-hye made a gesture and asked.\n\"Same as ever. Still can't stand looking at my face?\"\nYu So-hwa tried to make her stop her gesture by using her powers when BI Mak-heon intervened.\n\"You were talking about using this. Can you tell us what you mean?\"\nIm So-hye smiled and then went back to looking at Chun Yeowun, she placed her finger on the table, and as she dragged it back, she said.\n\"You look more handsome than on the news. You are talented and handsome. So So-hwa Unnie gave up her work?\"\nIm So-hye seemed interested in Chun Yeowun.\nWhen they first entered here, she was the one who noticed Yu So-hwa, so she was curious.\nAs far as she knew, Yu So-hwa couldn't just quit like that.\nHowever, she was wondering if this man was attractive enough for her to give up on it, and he definitely was.\n\"You are attractive.\"\nShe patted the table and kept flirting.\nSeduction.\nBut Chun Yeowun didn't seem interested.\n\"Answer the question you were asked.\"\nIm So-hye frowned.\n'How can he be so indifferent when I am here?'\nThis was a first for her.\nShe was always confident with her body, from a narrow waist to voluptuous breasts.\nShe thought this man would definitely like her too.\nIn fact, a lot of men liked her.\n'Trying to act hard to get?'\nSuch an indifferent attitude stimulated her desire to win.\nShe thought there was no reason why she couldn't have him.\nIm So-hye spoke with a smile.\n\"If I tell you, what can you do for me?\"\nIt was a seduction trick she used the most.\nIt was safe to say that if he said he would offer a drink outside, then he passed.\nBut the words from Chun Yeowun were.\n\"Your life is spared.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nIm So-hye's face went stiff. She even doubted her ears for a moment.\n\"Just now… what did you say?\"\n\"Do you have hearing problems? I said I would spare your life.\"\n\"Ha!\"\nIm So-hye exasperated.\nSince she became an SS-class keeper, nobody has dared talk to her in such a way.\nNo, this wasn't guts, it seemed like recklessness.\n\"Puaha!\"\nA snorting sound in the ear.\nIt was Yu So-hwa who laughed.\nUntil recently, she was upset with Im So-hye being here, but she was feeling better now.\nGrunt!\nBiting her lip which was painted red, she asked.\n\"Spare my life? It's been a long time since I've seen such an arrogant man. But did that outstanding confidence come from your own strength? Or does it stem from So-hwa Unnie over there…\"\nShh!\n\"Ah?\"\nShe stopped talking when something touched her neck.\n'When?'\nHu Bong, who was next to Chun Yeowun, threatened her with his finger with sword energy embedded on it.\nAlthough she wasn't Murim, at the sharp sensation on her neck, she felt a chill run down her spine.\n\"Lady. Lord didn't tell you to speak what you want. He told you to answer the question.\"\nIn front of Chun Yeowun, Hu Bong was a funny, light-hearted guy, but there was no forgiveness for anyone who was rude to his Lord.\nWith a stiff face, the woman spoke.\n\"There is a place. It is definitely good money. Especially considering such strong men.\"\n\"Lady. The warning ends…\"\nHu Bong turned his head to some people approaching him from behind.\nFive men and women, dressed in banquet attire, approached Hu Bong with angry faces.\nIm So-hye smiled and said,\n\"I believe in myself the most, but there are team members on whom I can count on too. You know, right? So-hwa Unnie, SGK team members.\"\nA team led by Im So-hye.\nHu Bong threatened her from behind.\nThey approached the table with angry faces ready to fight, when a waiter appeared.\n\"No fighting inside Black Athena. If you want to fight, take this outside.\"\nThat was the rule. And one of the waiters came up to Im So-hye and said,\n\"The VIP members' trading room is ready.\"\nAs if feeling bad, Im So-hye said.\n\"What exquisite timing. It was unfortunate. I wanted to have a little more fun.\"\nShe turned and tried to move, but Hu Bong stopped her.\n\"Lady. You haven't answered yet.\"\n\"…\"\nIm So-hye's face turned red.\nAlthough she was suppressing her emotions as much as she could, now she felt insulted.\n\"I said no to fighting. Members.\"\nThe waiter's voice got stronger, and he warned both Hu Bong and her.\nAnother mess and the waiter was sure to send them out.\n'Ha. If only we didn't meet here.'\nBecause she had work to do now, she tried to be reasonable.\nShaking her head, she looked at Chun Yeowun and said,\n\"The rule is to put a coin in a martini and drink it. If you don't do that, you won't get anyone here.\"\nThe way to trade. Surprisingly, the waiter didn't stop her. It seemed like irrelevant information to them.\n\"Let's meet another time! Vice-chairman.\"\nIm So-hye turned her head proudly. Hu Bong cleared the path he blocked so she could move.\nAs she was passing, she looked at him and said,\n\"You. You are quite different from what you look like. Lady? Were you locked in a freezer for a thousand years or something? Those words are used in historical drama. Huh!\"\nThis was a way for her to get rid of anger.\nAfter she followed the waiter, Hu Bong spoke to Chun Yeowun with a serious face.\n\"Lord… that woman isn't an ordinary one. Seeing me and telling me that I have been trapped in ice, she seems to have intellect.\"\n\"… sit down.\"\nHu Bong couldn't tell the difference between a joke and the truth.\nAfter he sat, Chun Yeowun received the coin from Bi Mak-heon.\nA coin about the size that would be hard to swallow.\n'Drink this while putting it in?'\nThe martini left by the waitress when they entered. It was used for this. However, it was strange to drink this.\n\"Vice-chairman. There's probably something vague about it. Rather, let me do it just to be sure.\"\nBi Mak-heon looked at the coin and the drink suspiciously.\nChun Yeowun put his finger on them and asked.\n'Nano. Analyze if poison is on them?'\n[I'll check.]\nAnd Nano never took long.\n[Neither the coin nor the drink is toxic.]\n'No poison?'\nNeither had poison in them.\n'Then why did she ask us to put the coin and drink?'\nNano gave the answer.\n[If the two are mixed together, they cause strong toxicity the moment they come in contact with stomach acids.]\n'I see.'\nNow it was solved.\nAll elements needed to be there for the poison to take effect.\nThe poison was a safety device used by the Black Athena.\nEven if a coin was given out, no one could detect anything on it, so there was no way public security would come for them.\nSmiling, he put the coin into the drink. And then took the glass.\n\"Vice-chairman!\"\nBi Mak-heon was startled and tried to stop, but Chun Yeowun swallowed it down in one shot.\nIt didn't matter if he drank this. He had an indestructible body thanks to Nano, so it could decompose the poison.\n\"It is better if I…\"\nIf Bi Mak-heon took it, he would immediately die.\n\"No need.\"\nChun Yeowun, who didn't want to create a mess by telling them about the poison, didn't mention it.\n[Decomposition of toxic substances in the body is done.]\nThe poison has already been detoxified. And before long, a waiter came.\n\"Copper trading room is ready. Please ask the companions to wait until the talks are over.\"\nHu Bong tried to protest.\n\"Lord, you can't go in alo…\"\n\"Enough. Wait here.\"\nBut at Chun Yeowun's words, he sat down again.\nAfter he instructed them to wait, he was guided by the waiter and headed to another entrance on the other side of the hall.\nUpon entering that place, he saw seven doors.\nAmong the doors painted with Athena in black, gold, silver, copper, red, blue and white, the waiter for copper opened the door.\n\"Please head down the hallway.\"\nThe hallway was straight. And as he went inside, a smaller hall appeared.\nThere was only one table and chair.\nShh!\nAs soon as he entered, Chun Yeowun smiled.\nThe entire floor was equipped with a ventilation system, so he couldn't use internal energy to detect the sound.\nIn addition, there seemed to be several other safety devices.\nThud!\nSomething which looked like a wall went down and blocked the entrance.\nIt was pretty thick.\n-Please take a seat.\nAn altered voice spoke from the speaker.\nChun Yeowun walked leisurely and sat down on the chair.\nWoong!\nA hologram was formed opposite to the table as the light came from the ceiling. A man in a black mask and tuxedo appeared.\nHe politely greeted with one arm stretched outside and the other one in his stomach.\n-Welcome. Welcome member.\nChun Yeowun looked at it and asked.\n\"You don't seem to prefer face-to-face meetings.\"\n-I am sorry if you feel uncomfortable. This is for security reasons.\n\"Well, it doesn't matter.\"\n-Thank you. We will notify you before the trade. First of all, you must never speak out about any transaction which happens here. Second, the basic interview is about 10 minutes, and you have to pay another 10 minutes if needed.\nWheing!\nBoth sides of the table were split in half, revealing a glass table.\nA glass and something which looked like a rose-shaped faucet appeared.\nRed liquid flowed from the faucet and filled the glass.\n-Since you are here for the first time, let me explain. If you do not take this antidote in 10 minutes, the toxins in your body will spread all throughout. Please remember that.\nA timer was marked on the table. The poison was a device they used for trade.\n-Trading starts the moment you drink the antidote.\nThe masked man held out his hand and showed it. And when Chun Yeowun drank it, the timer started.\n-Then let's start trading. Do you want to sell or buy?\nSo they didn't just sell, but also bought.\n\"Buy.\"\n-Alright. I'll let you know before we start. Please note that there are items that are subject to transaction restrictions depending on your level. So what do you want to buy?.\n\"Information.\"\n-Please note that the price varies depending on how specific the information is and how difficult it is to obtain. What is the information you are looking for?\nAt that, Chun Yeowun directly asked.\n\"MS Group.\"\n\"…\"\nWhen he said MS Group, the man didn't answer. Even though it was a hologram, Chun Yeowun noticed the man's eyes shaking.\n\"I want all the information you have on MS Group. Even better if you can give me their location and how to connect to them.\"\nAt that, the man glanced somewhere and then opened his mouth.\n-Sorry. The information you asked for can't be given at your trading level.\nIt means he won't give.\n\"Then at which level?\"\n-The information you mentioned is open to VIP members. Sorry for not being of any help. If you have other stuff, I can respond to that. If not, I'll close this inte…\n\"Is it possible to trade if I get to the VIP room?\"\nAt Chun Yeowun's question, the man gave a straight answer.\n-Not possible without membership.\n\"If I really need this information.\"\nThe masked man responded in a rather cold voice.\n-We will expunge you according to the rules of Black Athena.\nIt meant to be killed.\nChun Yeowun seemed interested.\n\"And how do you plan to do that?\"\n-The trading hours end soon. I warn you. If we don't open the door to this room, you'll have your organs melted, and you'll be a corpse within 5 minutes. If you keep insisting, that is what happens.\nThe masked man blinked, and the rose faucet was back on the table.\n-Now you have 6 minutes and 35 seconds left. Please choose.\n\"I need to get any information related to MS Group.\"\n-Then the trade will end here. Please forgive me for not being able to see you off on the way to the underworld…\n\"The VIP room is in the basement?\n-Huh?\nFor a moment, the masked man was confused. At first glance, people would think that the VIP rooms were on the same floor, but the VIP room was in the basement.\n\"I guess it must be right.\"\nIt was a guess based on the strongest energy around, and it was correct.\nChun Yeowun said to him.\n\"I also warn you. If you don't guide me to the VIP room right now, I won't leave your limbs intact.\"\n-Ha!\nThe masked man glared at Chun Yeowun as if it was ridiculous.\nIt was absurd to threaten a hologram when he was the one going to die.\n-Crazy bastard.\nThe masked man said as he looked at Chun Yeowun.\nAnd then turned off the hologram.\nPick!\nIn another room on the other side of the trading, full of monitors with CCTV videos.\nSeveral people were inside, a man with a mask and tuxedo on the hologram device asked.\n\"Is it off?\"\n\"Yes. Right.\"\n\"How the hell did the idiot know where the VIP room is?\"\nThe VIP room has an elevator. It reaches the basement when the transaction starts. So most people don't notice it.\n\"Absurd guy. He was right in front of me and threatening me.\"\nA man in front of the monitor shook his head.\nAnd then asked.\n\"What should we do? Should we wait until automatic expunge is started?\"\nAt that, the man in the tuxedo shook his head.\n\"No. The expungement is confirmed, so why wait that long for him to die? Push the deals of the other copper members.\"\n\"Yes.\"\nThe man in front of the monitor was about to press the button for gas release.\nAs soon as the poison gas was inhaled, one would die within 30 seconds.\n\"Uh? But what is he doing?\"\nChun Yeowun, seen through the monitor, was approaching the wall.\nThe wall was sturdy and made of a special alloy thicker than the other sides of the room. Even a bomb couldn't break it open.\n\"What is with him? What is that bastard doing now?\"\nThe man in front of the monitor laughed at the question of the masked man.\n\"There is a ventilation system in that room, so he can't use anything. It looks like he is trying to do something stupid. Should we keep an eye on him?\"\n\"He must be stupid. I wondered what a great guy he was because he came in the news, but he hardly understood….\"\nChachacha!\nAt that moment, a sharp sound was heard.\n\"Ugh?\"\nChun Yeowun on the monitor was holding an energy sword against the wall.\nBut why were they hearing the sound from this side?\n\"How is…\"\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun kicked the wall with his foot.\nBang!\nAt that time, the wall they were standing close to flew off.\nFlustered, those who were standing pulled out their weapons.\nSrng! Srrng! Srrng!\nIt was unbelievable. Cutting down a special alloy thick wall with bare hands!\n\"Uh, how can we let the gas enter when the ventilation…\"\nShh!\nBefore the masked man could speak, Chun Yeowun reached out his hand and the weapons they were carrying moved away from their hands and landed on the floor in front of Chun Yeowun.\nThu-thud!\n\"Ah!\"\n\"My blade!\"\nIt didn't end there.\nWhen Chun Yeowun pretended to clench his fist, the swords on the floor shattered like glass.\nCrack!\n'What nonsensical power!'\nThey were perplexed, but Chun Yeowun suddenly approached the masked man.\nHe then grabbed him by the neck.\nGrab!\n\"Kuak!\"\n\"I warned you.\"\nSlash!\nAs soon as he said that, Chun Yeowun's energy sword cut his right arm.",

      "content": "Chapter 119: Black Athena (3)\n\"Kuak!\"\nThe masked man in a tux gripped his severed hand.\nHe looked at Chun Yeowun, who was looking down at him, with frightened eyes.\n'What the hell is he? A monster!'\nThose who dealt with information knew that Chun Yeowun was related to the Sky Demon Order.\nBut they were overconfident in their own defense system, the gas and the poison, so they never imagined that things could turn out like this.\nHe remembered what happened 2 hours ago.\nThe Black Athena's Second Master gathered all the people.\n[The vice-chairman of the Yongchun Group might come?]\nThe vice-chairman made headlines in the news.\nThe fact that the Yongchun Group was the descendant of the Demonic Cult couldn't be unknown.\nRecently, rumors that the Demonic Cult was being resurrected have caused a stir in the Murim world.\n[Isn't that Yongchun Group the Demonic Cult one?]\n[Why would they come to Black Athena?]\nFor the Forces of Evil, the relationship with the Demonic Cult was rather subtle.\nAlthough they were known to be the evil kind just like the forces of Evil, they acted proud and said they were different.\nAlthough they weren't in direct confrontation, the Demonic Cult strongly despised others and never came in contact with the Forces of Evil.\n[According to the information, they are aiming for the wealth and power of the Black Athena to help with their resurrection.]\nThe Second Master warned that the Demonic Cult would come in contact with them with ill intentions.\nThus, if they showed any signs of making a fuss in the pretext of a deal, the workers were ordered to expunge them.\n[However, wouldn't that make us enemies of the Demonic Cult?]\n[They have the power to even take down the main office of the Association, shouldn't we be more careful?]\nNaturally, some people were concerned.\nBut the Second Master said,\n[Don't worry. If we do it, the Murim Association will come to our side.]\n{The Murim Association? They will interfere?}\n[Yes. The Demonic Cult and the Murim Association are currently at war. It wouldn't be hard for them to interfere. Besides, the one called Chun Mu-seong is the biggest enemy of the Association, so they will make sure to use this chance to repay the disgrace they faced.]\nAs people heard it, no one felt concerned anymore.\nIn addition, in the absence of the Master, the Second Master held all powers in Black Athena, so everyone would have to obey his orders.\n'Kuak… If only the Master was here, this wouldn't have happened.'\nIt was too late to regret.\nThings happened and this monster was now right in front of him.\n\"Guide me to the VIP room. You don't want to lose your other arm, do you?\"\nChun Yeowun gave a daunting command. At that, the masked man endured the pain and reminded,\n\"Yah, if you don't take the antidote, you will die. Are you sure you can threaten me?\"\nThe gas was stopped, but what about the poison?\nNo matter how strong the man was, in order to clear the poison with only cultivation, it would take a long time. At least, that was what he thought.\n\"Are you talking about this?\"\nWhen Chun Yeowun raised his hand, something like black gas rose from his skin.\nThe black liquid floated in the air. And Chun Yeowun snapped his finger.\nPang!\nThe black liquid split into several directions and penetrated the bodies of the Black Athena staff who were struggling with anxious faces.\n\"Kuak!\"\n\"W-what is this…\"\nFlustered, they touched the parts where the liquid entered and tried to squeeze it out.\n\"Ugh!\"\n\"Poison?\"\nThe poison was spreading through their bodies, so they tried to start cultivating. Six people sat on the floor at the same time. The masked man couldn't help but be shocked.\n\"No way…\"\nThe poison they were proud of was now inside their bodies. They weren't sure, but it turned out that Chun Yeowun had cleared the poison.\nAt their shock, Chun Yeowun said.\n\"Last warning. If you want your other limbs to stay intact, guide me to the VIP room.\"\n6th basement floor of Black Athena.\nUnlike the normal hall, this was a huge circular hall.\nIn such a place, a door made of tempered glass and about 10 meters of space was arranged outside the circle.\nHowever, in this place, people in tight-fitting grey tights locked up one by one were displayed like items.\nWhat was peculiar was that the eyes of the people in that glass space were out of focus. They had blank expressions like they had lost it.\nThud!\nA man in a blue tux with a mustache and pomade hair touched one of the glasses.\n\"This is a 3rd generation improved model.\"\nThe man inside the glass was called to be a 3rd generation improved model.\nThere was a woman in a red dress waving her hand at the sight of the man in the glass, it was Im So-hye, the SS-class keeper.\n\"Is he unconscious?\"\n\"Without the owner's command, thinking and cognition are still not possible. The risk can be regarded as zero. Hahaha.\"\nThe man who was smiling and explaining was Byun Ho-young, the Second Master of Black Athena.\nHe was the second in command and exclusive to the VIP members.\nFrom Gold members with high loyalty and high purchase rates, the managers come down themselves and don't just appear as holograms.\nVIP members have many privileges, including their ability to bring in up to 5 companions.\nSo Im So-hye's team members came along.\n\"His chin is unique.\"\nIm So-hye said while looking at the one in the glass.\nByun Ho-young answered with a smile.\n\"The 3rd gen has improved structure and genes, so the body changes are more unique and colorful. As the jaw moves, it turns into a larger mouth.\"\n\"Ohh.\"\nThe man with glasses frowned when he heard the thing about the jaw, it just felt pretty creepy.\n\"Although the mutant does look pretty ugly, it has amazing abilities. I can guarantee that. It is far superior to the 2nd gen models with carnivorous mammalian genes.\"\nThe people in the glass space that Byun Ho-young pointed to were unusual.\nSome had long ears and others had leopard patterns.\nAccording to him, these were genetically engineered humans.\n\"The price is obviously higher than the 2nd gen. one B-class core per object.\"\n\"Ha!\"\nAt Byun Ho-young's words, Im So-hye's team members were shocked.\nUnlike other transactions, this floor would only accept cores as a form of payment.\nEven a B-class core was known to be very expensive.\n\"Ah, it isn't that expensive. This 3rd Gen model can easily deal with Super Master level Murims and A-class keepers.\"\n\"Dealing with an A-class keeper? Isn't it unreasonable to think that engineered humans could exhibit such crazy things?\"\nOne of Im So-hye's team members, a 2-meter tall man, said while clicking his tongue.\nAs an A-class keeper, it felt like Byun Ho-young's words were targeted at him.\nSuper Masters and A-class Keepers were those in charge of people's safety.\n\"You don't seem to believe it.\"\n\"I won't believe it unless I see it with my own eyes.\"\n\"Huhuhu, then shall we take time to check out the product? No.27 glass restraint released.\"\nWhiing!\nAt Byun Ho-young's words, the glass went up and opened.\nAs the door opened, the muscular man inside stepped forward.\n\"If the A-class Keeper Pa Jin-sang checks it, he might be able to trust us more.\"\nAt Byun Ho-young's words, Pa Jin-sang's eyes turned sharp.\nAlthough they had come here several times before, no one knew their names, but since this place dealt with information, they knew who the guests were.\nPa Jin-sang looked at Im So-hye asking for permission.\n\"Good.\"\nPa Jin-sang took off his tux and walked to the middle.\n\"I believe that you won't ask me to compensate you if the product is defiled?\"\n\"Of course not. However, be careful not to get hurt.\"\n\"Huh. Doesn't apply to me.\"\nPa Jin-sang spoke in a confident voice.\nHis ability was super strength. He could exert force up to 100 tons.\nWith that strength, he could easily crush steel. He was a Keeper who defeated dangerous Gate entities with just his fists.\n\"You can order the product right now too. And if it doesn't work, you can ask for a change too. No. 23, defeat him.\"\nAs soon as Byun Ho-young's words fell, the man in grey tights ran towards him.\nThe movement was incredibly fast. Like bouncing off the floor and reaching the middle of the room at once.\nPuck!\nThe man in tights who was hit by Pa Jin-sang bounced back.\nThe Keepers who watched it cheered.\n\"Wowh!\"\nThey assumed that the genetically made model was of no match to them.\nHowever, Pa Jin-sang's expressions changed.\nHe clenched his fist, but it didn't exactly feel like he hit something.\n'What is this? This weird feeling?'\nIt felt more foreign than dealing with Gate objects.\nA very bad feeling.\nPhat!\nThe guy in grey tights, who bounced back, flew towards the man as soon as his foot touched the ground.\nHe raised his fists upwards and tried to smash Pa Jin-sang.\nPa Jin-sang, who stopped it, tried to land a hit, but something completely different happened.\nSwosh!\n\"Gasp!\"\nFrom the elbow, the arms were split open.\nAnd then long arms which seemed made of saw blades came out.\nThe same with legs as well.\nSwosh!\nHe opened his mouth, and the chin cracked.\nThe ugly appearance didn't look human at all.\nIt literally seemed like an insect.\n\"Mantis?\"\nIm So-hye mumbled.\nThe Second Master Byun Hi-young smiled and answered.\n\"Right answer.\"\nThis man was a human with a mantis gene.\nHonestly, calling him human was ridiculous.\n'Th-this is a monster!'\nPa Jin-sang had outstanding durability and strength, but he didn't want to block those long arms, so he tried to avoid being hit.\nShhhh!\nJust by spreading the long arms, he managed to grab the opponent at once.\n\"This bastard!\"\nGrab!\nPa Jin-sang tried to grab the arm and break it. However, despite his ability, he couldn't break off the mantis man's arms.\n'What power does this one have?'\nRather, the area around the hand changed.\nSlash!\n\"Kuak!\"\nPa Jin-sang's palm tore.\nThe moment he released his hand in shock, the mantis opened the forked jaw and bit Pa Jin-sang's shoulder.\nCrack!\nThe ferocious teeth hurt the man. They dug in so easily that it was as if the mantis tried to rip it off.\n\"Ack!\"\nAs Pa Jin-sang screamed, Second Master Byun Ho-young snapped his fingers and shouted.\nSnap!\n\"Stop!\"\nAs soon as the command fell, the mantis opened its mouth.\nBlood kept dripping down the pierced shoulder and the teeth marks were visible.\n\"Kuak… kuak…\"\nPa Jin-sang's eyes tinged with fear as he groaned. It was the first time he had experienced this kind of fear since the Gate battles.\n“Strong Pa Jin-sang like this?”\n\"Sigh…\"\nHis colleagues were shocked and so was Im so-hye.\nByun Ho-young smiled and said to her,\n\"How was it? Enough?\"\nThis was a super amount of power, so admiringly she said,\n\"Is there anything stronger than this?\"\n\"There is a 4th gen improved version.\"\nShockingly, there was a stronger one.\nIf the 3rd gen made with insect genes were this strong how strong could the next gen be?\n\"The 4th gen is really expensive and we have a limited number.\"\n\"How many?\"\n\"I was only asked to sell 2 of them and the two aren't up for brokering.\"\n\"Reason?\"\n\"Up to the 3rd gen, they are possible to produce when the genes are available, but when it comes to the 4th gen, it is tough.\"\nHearing that, Im So-hye was curious.\n\"How much?\"\n\"3 A-class cores.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nThe outrageous payment shocked her.\nIt wasn't an exaggeration to say that getting a single A-class core was almost impossible, but three?\n\"How can the price go up like that?\"\n\"Because it is worthy. You did see this one right? A 3rd gen can easily overwhelm an A-class Keeper. And that one can easily surpass it.\"\n\"Nevertheless. The payment is so…\"\n\"The Japanese, Russians and Americans have bought 14 of them at a higher price in the auction markers. Comparatively, this is a lower price.\"\nAt those words, Im So-hye's eyes lit up.\nIt was said that the price paid for it was extremely high, but it was something else that drew her attention.\n\"Oh my. Are you going to auction them on the market?\"\nAt that, Byun Ho-young realized he had said something he shouldn't have and went silent.\nThe auction wasn't something he had the liberty to speak about.\n\"Ahh, I made a mistake. There is so much competition in the black market rather than auctions…\"\nClick!\nThe earpiece which was plugged in his ear beforehand suddenly began to give static.\n-Second Master, we have a problem.\nIt was a call from the Control Room. In response, Byun Ho-young looked at Im So-hye and said,\n\"Could you give me a moment?\"\nAnd then, he moved slightly away from them.\n\"What is it?\"\n-He is on the way to the 6th-floor basement.\n\"He?\"\n-The vice-chairman of the Yongchun group.\n\"What?\"\nByun Ho-young couldn't hide his shock. To get here means to pass through several defense systems.\nIf he wanted to get here, he would have been blocked by the other rooms. So how?\n\"What about the poison?\"\n-I don't know sir. We didn't know until he even got into the elevator.\n\"What are you spouting now? How did he?\"\n-Seeing that Cooper is accompanying him, it seems like he is taking the manager's aisle.\nThe paths for guests and managers were different.\nDespite the tight surveillance, the cameras in the manager path were few.\nAnd there was an elevator there.\n\"Stop the elevator!\"\nThe elevator was made of superalloy just in case. It had the strength to even withstand an explosion.\n-Already shut it and send fighters to the elevator…\nIt was then.\nSlash!\nThe entrance of the elevator at the entrance of the hall split and then,\nBang!\nBroke.\nSomeone appeared from the smoke.\nIt was Chun Yeowun in his usual attire.\n'Vice-chairman Chun Mu-seong?'\nIm So-hye couldn't hide her curiosity.\nThe man who appeared after breaking an elevator definitely didn't have good intentions.\nChun Yeowun said as he walked in.\n\"Are you the representative of Black Athena?\"\nChun Yeowun's eyes went to Byun Ho-young, and the man's face contorted.\n'In the middle of the most important deal!'\nEverything was disturbed.\nAt that time, a man with curly hair, one of Im So-hye's team members, stepped ahead and said.\n\"Our deal isn't done yet, what is this now? Go back and…\"\nSwish!\nChun Yeowun ignored him and passed by.\nAngry at that, the curly-haired man tried to show off his abilities.\n\"Cheeky bastard…\"\n\"Don't bother me.\"\nSwish!\nChun Yeowun lightly waved his hand and the man's body bowed to the side.\nWoong!\n\"Euk!\"\nBang!\nHis upper body went into the tempered glass and stuck into it.\nThe entire team couldn't hide their shock at the sight of an A-class Keeper being taken down in an instant.\n\"No. 23, get rid of him!\"\nSecond Master shouted in panic.\nThe mantis man in the middle flew for Chun Yeowun with the jaws wide open.\nPhat\n!\n\"What kind of joke is this?\"\nChun Yeowun stretched out his right hand.\nThe mantis man who was aiming to attack him stopped mid-air and the legs shuddered.\nIn that state, Chun Yeowun clenched his fist.\nCrack!\n\"Kuaaak!\"\nThe mantis man's body folded like a ball and rolled on the ground.\n'W-what is that…'\nAt that scene, Pa Jin-sang fell into despair. It was absurd to see the mantis which caused him pain and anguish die at a single gesture.",

      "content": "Chapter 120: Black Athena (4)\n'No!?'\nSecond Master Byun Ho-young couldn't hide his shock.\nThe mantis, a genetically engineered model, died so absurdly. He thought that it would at least earn some time, but the gap was too wide to cover.\n'How on earth can he have so much power to do that with just internal energy?'\nIf he hadn't mastered Martial Arts, he would have thought that Chun Yeowun was a person with ability.\nAs Byun Ho-young was a member of the Forces of Evil, he wasn't famous, but he was a Superior Master.\n'That, that one is a monster.'\nAnd because of that, he was able to guess Chun Yeowun's skills.\n'Damn that Yeom Hae-kyun!'\nByun Ho-young cursed the members of the Murim Association.\nHe fell in love with the theory the man said and believed in the poison they made, but everything was in vain now.\n'I can't help it anymore.'\nOnce the opponent's strengths were understood, the next choice was obvious.\n\"Release all restraints.\"\nWheing!\nAt his command, all the glass doors opened.\nFrom the 1st to the 3rd gen, 29 genetically weaponized humans walked out.\nIf this person had to be stopped, all of them would have to be used.\nIm So-hye shouted at that.\n\"Look here, Second Master! Our deal isn't done yet!\"\nThe deal was very important for her.\nThis was being done after she received the orders of the Director of the National Defense, and if she failed, the ongoing plan would be back to the starting point.\n'Ah!'\nAt her cry, Byun Ho-young's eyes lit up. The clever man thought of a way to take advantage of the moment.\n\"Member. That man is going against the rules of Black Athena. There isn't much we can do.\"\n\"Tch!\"\nIm So-hye was irritated. It was because she understood what the man was trying to hint at.\n'This clever raccoon bastard is trying to make me move.'\nUnless one was an idiot, they could have easily noticed it.\nShe was an SS-class Keeper. There were only three people who were as strong as her.\nAnd this man wanted her help to stop Chun Yeowun.\n\"If the member can stop him, I will listen to you as much…\"\nWoong!\n\"Hic!\"\nBefore he could even finish his words, a profound energy pulled him. His body which was floating moved to Chun Yeowun.\n\"Don't use your brain.\"\nThere was no way Chun Yeowun would let him do what he wanted.\n'This is insane!'\nByun Ho-young tried to use his own internal energy, but nothing happened. And was caught by Chun Yeowun's hand.\nIt was then,\nBang!\nByun Ho-young, who was up, fell to the ground.\nA tremendous pressure which was created prevented him from moving further.\nChun Yeowun looked at Im So-hye right away.\n\"Don't look at me with those eyes. There are rules and morality in everything and you are the one who ignored it.\"\n\"Are you going to interfere?\"\n\"Interfere? That is funny. I was the first to come here and deal with him. Don't tell me you have forgotten that?\"\nShe was right. Chun Yeowun was the one who broke the deal in the middle.\nHowever, he couldn't make concessions after what she did.\n'Right! Hurry up and fight.'\nByun Ho-young, who was released from the energy, liked what was going on.\nBanter usually leads to fighting, and once they start to fight, he was planning to escape into the underground shelter.\n'It is a pity that I won't get to see the fun scene of the Demonic Cult's best being defeated by a Keeper, but I at least will get to live.'\nThat was the most important thing, life.\nHowever, what Chun Yeowun said was unexpected.\n\"Okay. Then I will wait until your deal is done.\"\n'!?'\nByun Ho-young's expression grew distorted. This wasn't what he hoped for.\nIf they continued their trade, Im So-hye wouldn't have to fight,\n\"Such a gentleman. Thank you for understanding. After my trade is done, the vice-chairman can take care of his business.\"\nShe immediately accepted it.\n'This bitch!'\nHe wanted them to fight, but now that they had reached an agreement, he was shocked.\nLooking at Chun Yeowun, he knew that the guy wasn't the friendly kind, and asking him to let her complete her trade, wouldn't that mean she wanted to fight? But what was this?\n'Huh! Did that raccoon bastard think I would fall for his plan!'\nIm So-hye had no intention of fighting Chun Yeowun. She couldn't even fathom how capable he was, and she wasn't the kind to enter fights for no reason.\nHowever, her team members weren't of the same opinion.\n\"Team leader! That person made Yeong-gang like that and you are letting him go?\"\n\"This isn't what we do right?\"\nThey trusted Im So-hye, the SS-class Keeper, and thought that she would subdue Chun Yeowun.\n'It isn't that I don't care.'\nIm So-hye glared back at her teammates. It meant to shut their mouths.\nThey were dissatisfied, but she had absolute authority, so they could no longer express their opinion.\n\"Okay then should we continue trading?\"\nIm So-hye smiled at the Second master.\nAt that, he bit his lip.\n'As soon as the deal is over, I am sure that he will kill me.'\nHe needed to plan. After thinking for a while, Byun Ho-young decided to take the risk.\n\"Well, nothing could be done. Then let's go. I've seen you take an interest in the black market.\"\n\"Ah!\"\nEven if she didn't say it out loud, Byun Ho-young noticed her reactions.\n\"I won't make unreasonable demands. If you protect me from that person, I will give you the right to attend the black market. And I will give you five items of your choice for free, so please help me.\"\nIm Sho-hye's eyes fluttered. It was because the proposal was unconventional.\nBesides, the National Defense was showing great interest in genetic technology.\nIt was an opportunity to obtain the objects and information they desired without spending any government funds.\n'Ahh…'\nShe couldn't help but be worried, and the deal was different.\nMoreover, Byun Ho-young didn't ask her to take down the man, he only asked for protection. He just asked to make sure he wasn't hurt.\n'It could be possible.'\nJudging from her conversation with Chun Yeowun, it seemed like he wasn't the reckless kind.\nShe wasn't sure if she could persuade him enough and take the role of a mediator.\n\"Fine. Keep your promise.\"\n\"I will.\"\nShe then turned to Chun Yeowun and opened her mouth cautiously.\n\"Vice-chairman Chun. If it isn't disrespectful, may I ask for a favor as a member of the National Defense?\"\n\"Favor?\"\n\"Yes. If there is no malicious relationship with the Second Master of Black Athena, I would like the vice-chairman to ensure his safety. Wouldn't it be better to get what we want without bloodshed?\"\nShe came up with the right choice of words.\nThis way, there would be no need to argue with each other.\nChun Yeowun said.\n\"If the information I want is handed over, there will be no bloodshed.\"\nIf he was given the information right away, he wouldn't have even come to this place. Im So-hye who wasn't sure of what he wanted was happy.\n\"Oh my. I see why Unnie moved to you hehehe.\"\nWhen he answered the way he wanted, she looked at Byun Ho-young.\n\"You heard it. Second Master.\"\n\"… yes.\"\nHe didn't want this, but Byun Ho-young had no reason to hesitate if his life was being spared for information.\nSo he asked,\n\"May I ask what kind of information you want?\"\n\"All information you have on MS Group. How to get in contact with them and their hideout location.\"\nAt those words, Byun Ho-young's eyes fluttered.\nHis expression hardened right away.\nIf this was asked in a normal situation, he would have said it was too tough to get that, but now the situation was different.\n'Damn it! Why did it have to be the MS group…'\nThe MS Group wasn't something he could touch. If he did then Black Athena itself could come and make them disappear.\n'I need to pretend like I don't know.'\nThe man here didn't know if he had the information or not, so he could take the risk.\nHiding his expression as much as he could, Byun Ho-young said.\n\"Ha… the information on that is…\"\nBut then an unexpected thing happened.\n\"The hall manager said that only those in charge of VIP members know of it. You aren't going to say you don't know, right?\"\n'!?'\nEverything seemed to have blown over. Byun Ho-young, who was planning to lie, was shocked.\n'What? That bastard!'\nThat bastard was currently trembling in the elevator.\nByun Ho-young bit his lip. If blown over, those people will annihilate Black Athena.\nEscaping from their hands would be impossible.\n'Damn it!'\nAny smooth transaction seemed unreasonable here.\nSo he shouted,\n\"Kill him!\"\nAll the modified humans from 1st to 3rd gen who were waiting for the orders tried to attack, but Chun Yeowun clicked his tongue and lowered his palm.\n\"Tch tch.\"\nBang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!\nAt that moment, all the modified ones knelt on the floor. Starting with the one who looked like a tiger, a grasshopper and many others.\nAll kneeling down, unable to get up.\n\"N-No way!\"\nByun Ho-young couldn't help but be astonished. Not one, but 29 of the modified humans were suppressed at the same time.\n'Who the hell is he?'\nThis wasn't something that even a warrior of the Five Great Warriors could do.\nThe tremendous energy emanating from all directions was so great that he was unable to breathe.\n\"Do you still think that these toys would work?\"\nChun Yeowun lowered his palm further.\nCrrrrrack!\nThe bodies kneeling down were on the ground and even dented the floor.\n\"Kuaaaaak!\"\n\"Keeeeek!\"\nThe modified humans died while howling a non-human wail.\n'No! no!'\nAt that, Byun Ho-young felt like he had to run away at any cost.\n5 meters ahead was another exit.\nPhat!\nByun Ho-young flew towards it.\n\"Stupid man.\"\nChun Yeowun reached out and pretended to pull him back.\nThe massive energy suppressed him. He couldn't even lift his foot and was pulled towards Chun Yeowun again.\n'Tch!'\nIm So-hye put on an annoyed expression, she tried to solve this smoothly, but all plans were in vain.\nEven if she didn't want to fight, she was being made to fight.\n\"I can't help it. Vice-chairman was the one who brought this…\"\nWoong!\n\"Ack!\"\nAt that moment, she felt a pain in her heart. As if something sharp had penetrated her. She grabbed her chest and looked at Chun Yeowun.\nIt was the Heart Sword.\n\"Y-You… coward…\"\n\"I knew you would attack soon, why would you think I would listen to you even after seeing my skills?\"\n\"You… you!\"\nIm So-hye's beautiful face was distorted. It was the first time that she had been subjected to such treatment before showing her skills.\nIt was shameful because her team members were in there.\n\"Accck! I will kill you!\"\nHow desperate she had to be for her to move with those bloody eyes\nPush!\nThe Heart Sword pierced her heart again and again.\n\"Kyaaak!\"\nIm So-hye rolled on the floor screaming in pain.\nChun Yeowun muttered in a dry voice.\n\"I don't have the time to hang out with you.\"\nHe didn't bother checking her abilities at all.\n\"T-team leader!\"\nHer team members were shocked and called for her.\nHowever, not a single person dared to step at the man who did this to her.\n\"Want to try?\"\nDespite Chun Yeowun's provocation, not a single person moved.\nSeeing how easily the SS-class Keeper was taken down, who could believe themselves and do this?\n\"You people at least have learning ability.\"\nChun Yeowun smiled. Meanwhile, he caught the neck of Byun Ho-young with his hand.\nGrab!\n\"Kuak!\"\nIn a savage voice, Chun Yeowun said to the man trembling in fear.\n\"Now should we hear the things I want to know?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 121: Unexpected Gain (1)\nIm So-hye grabbed her chest as if she was in pain and continued to cough up blood.\n\"Ack… Ack!\"\n'Team leader.'\nSeeing her suffering, her teammates didn't know what to do.\nIf they could, they wanted to take her and run away. However, dozens of ice swords were in the sky, threatening to stab them if they moved.\n'What the hell is he doing?'\nThe man had dragged Second Master Byun Ho-young into the broken elevator as it was hard to see. They thought it was torture, but there was no scream from there.\n'Damn it! Just what the hell is this!'\nThey were all a team made of elites.\nEven with just five members including their leader Im So-hye, they could take down the A-class Alpha entity, so this situation was absurd.\n'Is he really a Murim warrior?'\nIt was their first time hearing about a Murim warrior with such ability.\nNot long after, Chun Yeowun came out alone.\nFlinch!\nThe Keepers were fully dissatisfied. At the time, Chun Yeowun waved his hand, and the ice swords around shattered.\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun went closer to Im So-hye who was clutching her chest.\nThe red dress was full of dust as she was on the floor, and looked like a 10-year-old unable to hold back her pain.\nIt was sad to see such a beauty in pain, but Chun Yeowun looked at her with cold eyes.\n'Cruel man!'\n'Doesn't he have any compassion!'\nHer team members thought as they looked at him.\nHowever, when Chun Yeowun considered someone as an enemy, he never discriminated between men and women.\nAll were nothing but enemies.\n\"Is it painful?\"\nAt Chun Yeowun's cold question, she looked up.\nEyes with no sympathy.\nShe realized that this man wouldn't hesitate to kill her.\nHeart pain which lasted for 20 minutes already.\nThe first time she experienced her pride being stamped on.\nPak!\n\"Ha.. Ha… please! Please save… me.\"\nIm So-hye didn't pay attention to her team members anymore.\nHer desire to live made her throw away her pride.\n\"Is there any reason for me to keep you alive?\"\nAt Chun Yeowun's question, Im So-hye became paler.\nAgain, this man wouldn't hesitate to kill her.\nOne of her team members, a young man in glasses named Lee Wonju, said,\n\"If you have signed an agreement with the Ministry of Defense, in some way you are like a member of the Defense agency which the Keepers belong to. Are you still planning to kill us?\"\n\"Because I hate annoying things.\"\nChun Yeowun never trusted his enemies.\nOnce an enemy, then it was definite that they would keep aiming for him.\nIn particular, the Keepers related to the government would report this in detail and complicate it even more.\n\"I promise. We'll make sure to hide what happened here as a secret! Even if the director asks, we won't answer him, so please show mercy!\"\nLee Wonju fell flat on the floor and cried.\nAt that, the other Keepers too fell to their knees.\n\"Have mercy on us!\"\nThey fell down with clenched teeth. If they could get out alive, then they could at least have a different future.\n'Leave us. I will expose you right away to the Ministry of National Defense and make sure the contract is shattered.'\nSecret? Who keeps secrets on such things?\nAnd it wasn't like this man knew anything about them.\nChun Yeowun asked.\n\"You people, what are your levels?\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Your classes as Keepers.\"\nPa Jin-sang, who was injured, answered the question.\n\"We are all A-class Gate Keepers.\"\nThere was a certain amount of pride in his voice. Each of them was talented enough to be recruited by a city chief.\nAt that, Chun Yeowun said.\n\"Useless.\"\n\"What?\"\nSwish!\nWhen Chun Yeowun lifted his finger, Pa Jin-sang's neck bent backwards.\nCrack!\n\"Kuaak!\"\nThud!\nThe man fell to the floor right away. The other three couldn't hold back their shock and their comrade's death.\n\"Th-this, what is this?\"\n\"It is what you heard. I don't need you people.\"\nAnd those words made them even more confused.\nEven though they asked to be spared, they didn't remember saying they would become his subordinates.\nHowever, it was different for Chun Yeowun, he would only spare someone if they were of use to him.\n'We are useless?'\nThe other three were stunned.\nA-class Keepers, most cities would want them in their ranks to be less anxious during gate situations. And this guy was treating them like trash.\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun raised his hand upwards.\nWoong!\nIm So-hye, who was clutching her body in pain, suddenly thought.\nAs an SS-class Keeper, she was a human whose brain usage was at its maximum, and her mental power was extremely strong.\nEven after being hit by the Heart Sword, she didn't give up her will. At her level, despite being hit by the sword and not being able to hold the pain, she managed to survive.\n\"Want to live?\"\nIm So-hye pleaded with him at the question.\n\"Please… please spare me. I'll do whatever it takes. No, I'll quit being a Keeper and serve you just like So-hwa Unnie… please my life only…\"\nThis woman had a strong obsession with her life.\nAnd weakened by the pain in her heart, she wanted to live.\n\"You want to be like So-hwa?\"\n\"Haa… Haa… yes.\"\n\"Okay. Good.\"\n\"Ah!\"\nIm So-hye's face brightened at those words.\nAnd Chun Yeowun's finger gently pierced her slender neck.\nPuck!\n\"Ack!\"\nShe felt something creeping into her body.\nShocked, she yelled.\n\"W-what is that?\"\n\"Nano bombs.\"\n\"Nano bombs!\"\nHer eyes widened as if they would pop out.\nShe heard about the Nano bombs.\nThese people investigated it, and it was difficult to get their hands on it even through the black market.\n\"By now, the Nano bombs must have spread from your brain to other parts of your body as well too.\"\nSnap!\nAnd when Chun Yeowun snapped his hand, a small explosion occurred in Im So-hye's left palm.\nBang!\n\"Ack!\"\nShe screamed at the burning pain inside her palm and looked at it.\nTraces of charring could be seen.\n\"What do you think would happen if this exploded in the brain?\"\nAt that, her two eyes fluttered wildly.\nIf it exploded in her brain, then it meant absolute death.\n\"I-I said that I would serve you! So why?\"\n\"Didn't you say you wanted to be like So-hwa?\"\n\"Then, Unnie too?\"\nChun Yeowun affirmed with silence.\nShe was shocked to learn the truth behind Yu So-hwa's resignation. And that wasn't the end.\nTak!\nChun Yeowun put his hand down, and then removed the Heart Swords inside her heart.\nAs the excruciating pain disappeared, she looked a lot better, but Chun Yeowun's words were still keeping her on edge.\n\"Your first mission as my subordinate. Kill them all.\"\nThe ones he pointed to were the rest of her team.\n\"H-How… that…\"\nChun Yeowun smiled and then said to her as he looked at her trembling body.\n\"Prove your loyalty.\"\n'What… what should I do now?'\nIt was only at that moment she realized that she had made a deal with the Devil himself. Her team members looked at her with puzzled expressions.\nChun Yeowun had given her a tough choice.\n\"Team leader. You can't do this!\"\n\"H-Haven't we worked together for 4 years? Please…\"\nThe team members pleaded with her. Not knowing what to do, she looked at Chun Yeowun who was ready to snap his finger.\nHis gaze was directed to her head.\nIf she didn't kill them, she would die.\n'Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!'\nThe human heart is truly deceitful. There would be no shame if she would keep her honor and choose to die with them.\nBut she didn't have the guts to risk her life like that.\nWith teary eyes, Im So-hye opened her lips.\n\"I'm… sorry.\"\n'!?'\nThe team members were shocked.\nApology.\nThat meant their death sentence.\nWhen she closed her hands and reached out, the bodies of the three kneeling people were engulfed in strong wind pressure.\nStep!\nChun Yeowun came down the hidden underground passage.\nIt was the very passage that Byun Ho-young tried to escape from. One of the pieces of information that even the executives of Black Athena didn't know about was the 7th basement floor.\nBecause there was a hidden entrance in it.\nSlash!\nNormally, there would be a need for security awareness, but Chun Yeowun broke the hidden entrance.\nEntering the cracked area, he walked down the stairs and then another hall appeared.\nThe dark hall lit up automatically.\n\"Is this the place?\"\nThere were several safes in the hall. This was where Byun Ho-young had collected the goods he stole.\nAnd Chun Yeowun, who turned him into a ghost, learned of all the things and contents in the safe.\nChun Yeowun approached a certain safe and put his finger on it.\nWheeing!\nAnd when Nano hacked the security, the door opened right away.\nClick!\nWhen the door to the safe opened, an intense energy with dazzling light spread out in all directions.\nTo his surprise, there were as many as 8 cores inside.\nTwo of them were C-class, three B-class and three A-class.\n\"He hid a lot.\"\nThis wasn't a bad thing.\nRather, it was an advantage he never thought of.\nShhh!\nWhen Chun Yeowun raised his hand, the black wrist guard resonated.\nWoong!\nAnd then, a shadow flicked, causing a change.\nWhen Chun Yeowun moved, the cores inside the safe were all pulled into the shadows.\n'Convenient.'\nIf he could put them in the shadow realm, he wouldn't feel their weight.\nChun Yeowun, who took the cores, headed to the other safe.\nWhen he opened that safe, there were dozens of cards inside, with which he could retrieve cash right away.\nThe sum was about 83 billion won.\nCash laundering, if this was used, then he could reduce the loss which occurred with the mergers.\n'Such things seem quite nice.'\nAn almost astronomical amount of money was found.\nChun Yeowun, who put the cards in the shadow realm, opened other safes and took the goods.\nHe read from the memory that if all these items were sold, he would make almost 170 billion won.\nIf Byun Ho-young was alive, he wouldn't be able to contain his regret for losing all these.\n'Now only three are left.'\nThese were the main ones.\nTwo safes didn't differ in size, but the other one was 5 feet tall.\nChun Yeowun opened the small one.\nClack!\nInside was an invitation card with five blue letters written on it, 'MS Group'.\nIt was an invitation to the auction hosted by the MS Group.\nBlack Athena had a relationship with the MS Group through this auction house.\nUnusually, there was a black LED screen on the back of the invitation card and it was said that the location would appear there before the auction started.\n'Nano. Can you track this?'\n'Impossible if the other side doesn't send anything.'\nUnfortunately, he couldn't find it out right away.\nHowever, if the auction was held, he would know the location.\nShhh!\nAfter Chun Yeowun took the invitation, he opened the second safe.\nIf Byun Ho-young's memories were correct, an interesting thing had to be there.\nClack!\nWhen the safe opened, there was a glass bottle of 1L in it.\nIt contained a very thick red liquid. Chun Yeowun picked it up.\n\"This is…\"\nIt was his first time seeing blood in such a state.\nWhat could it be that Chun Yeowun was showing such interest in it?\n'We will check it later.'\nChun Yeowun put the bottle into the shadows and approached the largest one.\nThe safe opened shortly after, and unlike the others, it opened from the middle like an automatic door.\nWheeing!\nAs soon as the door opened, cold air greeted him.\nThe inside was ice cold and someone with both arms and legs bound was there.\nThe man, who seemed to be looking blank with his gray hair flowing out, breathed out as if he hadn't lost his life to the cold.\n\"Haa!\"\nChun Yeowun exclaimed.\nThe body in captivity was unique.\nThe body was white, like a snake with brilliant scales.\nLooking at that one, Chun Yeoun mumbled.\n\"The one who took the blood of Imoogi…\"\nSurprisingly, this person had taken the blood of Imoogi, one of the Five Spirits.",

      "content": "Chapter 122: Unexpected Gain (2)\nFive Spirit Beasts.\nThey are the five sacred beasts.\nThe Great Bird, Flame Qilin, White Tiger, Dragon Turtle and the Immogi were known to be the guardian spirits of the Jianghu region since ancient times, but they were also known to be chaos bringers due to their terrifying power.\nChun Yeowun looked at the man whose body was covered in white scales.\n'Couldn't withstand it.'\nIt was because of a side effect.\nThe blood of the core, which was known to be the central part and spiritual life of the beast, wasn't an elixir that anyone could take.\nEven the Superior Masters would meet their death if they dealt with it.\n'This is what happens when the pure blood of Imoogi is drunk.'\nChun Yeowun had also absorbed the Imoogi's spiritual power. However, it wasn't exactly Imoogi, it surely was a dragon, but its horns were cut off.\nWhen it was trying to ascend, it turned its pure self into a beast obsessed with anger, and then its power was absorbed.\nAnd that was the Sky Demon energy that resides in Chun Yeowun's body.\n'I was always curious about the pure form of Imoogi.'\nHe must be lucky.\nSo what Chun Yeowun put into the shadow realm a moment ago had to be the Imoogi's blood.\nCovered in white scales, this man must have taken about a third of the blood in the bottle.\n'Should I wake him?'\nChun Yeowun approached the man whose body was still being exposed to the cold air.\nFor a long time, he was in this freezer-like safe, so he breathed some energy into the man who had lost his consciousness.\nA warm energy penetrated the man's body. And made the cold air flowing through the body melt away.\nBlink!\nThe man's eyes opened. And when he did, he had unique black eyes with a unique cry which was different from a human.\n\"Surrrr!\"\nLike a snake.\nAnd his eyes looked at Chun Yeowun.\nClank!\nIf it wasn't for the restraints on his whole body, this man would have pounced on Chun Yeowun.\n\"Tch, it worked.\"\nInstead of controlling the Immogi's blood, this man let himself be consumed by it. He was no different from a ferocious beast.\nClank! Clank!\nAnd his strength grew stronger as time went on.\nIt seemed that the coldness in the freezer didn't bother him anymore because of what Chun Yeowun did.\n\"Hmm.\"\nGrab!\nChun Yeowun grabbed the man's head and then induced energy.\nIt was to suppress the power of the Imoogi, which was taking over the man's mind.\nWoong!\nThe man twisted his head as if in pain and tried to get out of Chun Yeowun's grasp.\nYet, the energy from Chun Yeowun rushed into his mind.\nAnd,\n\"Kuaak!\"\nA human-like groan erupted from his mouth. With a distressed voice, the man looked at Chun Yeowun and asked.\n\"W-Who?\"\n\"Shut your mouth and try to suppress that spiritual power with my energy.\"\n\"Suppress power… kuaak… ahhh!\"\nAs he had been in this state for too long, the man couldn't understand Chun Yeowun's words.\nAnd then he suddenly shouted like he had given up.\n\"No! This, this isn't the time for this! We need to stop the Second Master now! That bastard Byun Ho-young showed his true colors. He is aiming for the Master's position and hit… kuak!\"\nIt was gibberish, but he spoke all that he wanted to.\nThis man is the Master of Black Athena, Do Hyeon-soo. Chun Yeowun knew that from the Second Master's memories.\nBut he didn't care about it.\n\"He needs to be caught right away! He is after blood and effort!\"\nClank!\nThe restraints were holding him. And as he kept getting better, he kept getting stronger and stronger.\n\"Yah. Stop talking… if you want to live, concentrate and suppress that power raging in you.\"\nSubduing a raging spiritual energy wasn't something Chun Yeowun could do alone from the outside.\nIn fact, he had to suppress it and then the man had to embody it in himself, but Do Hyeon-soo wasn't in a state to understand what was happening, probably due to the side effects.\nHe blinked his eyes and then glared at Chun Yeowun.\n\"Byun Ho-young, you bastard!\"\nKwang!\nThe restraint tore off.\nDo Hyeon-soo threw his fist at Chun Yeowun, wanting to kill him.\nAnd as it contained the spiritual energy of the Imoogi, it was destructive.\nBut,\n\"You keep bothering me.\"\nTak!\n\"Ump!\"\nChun Yeowun grabbed the man's face and pressed it against the wall inside the safe.\nKwang!\nDo Hyeon-soo's body couldn't hold it.\nIt was powerful enough to kill any warrior at once.\nCrack!\nThe sounds of bones being crushed were coming outside. However, the broken bones were regenerating rapidly.\n\"You are recovering quickly because of the blood of Imoogi you took.\"\nChun Yeowun shook his head.\nDo Hyeon-soo's eyes lost reasoning, probably because he couldn't suppress the power.\nDo Hyeon-soo, who recovered fast, aimed for Chun Yeowun.\nPapapak!\nAlthough it seemed like he lost reason, he remembered the martial arts he had learned and unfolded them.\nIt was something that made even Chun Yeowun shocked. It was his first time seeing something like this and it was great.\nPapak!\nChun Yeowun, who suddenly felt interested in the man, decided to face him.\n'This much should be enough.'\nChun Yeowun put his hand in his pocket and raised his right arm as he held out his index finger.\nHe decided to stop the incoming attack with just his fingers.\nPapapak!\nChun Yeowun's fingers easily blocked the martial arts techniques that wanted to destroy everything.\nThe power contained in each punch was so overwhelming, that this man could destroy an entire place.\nHad this man been sane, he would have shocked himself.\n'The one who made this fist technique deserves to be called a genius.'\nChun Yeowun kept evaluating the punches.\nIt was no exaggeration to say that Chun Yeowun knew how to block three of the formations he did.\nIn addition, the most distinctive feature was.\nKwak!\nThe complicated movements were showing illusions.\nFrom a certain moment, the technique which unfolded showed illusions of numerous evil beings appearing and attacking in front of the other's eyes.\nAnd they all felt real. It was enough to add confusion to the enemy.\n\"But it is all a trick.\"\nHowever, it wasn't enough to confuse Chun Yeowun. Using this high trick to create illusions was close to an illusion clan.\nChun Yeowun, who had a glimpse of the universe beyond the energy of nature, saw the reality.\n\"It would have been a pain if this was more completed.\"\nPak!\nWhen Chun Yeowun snapped his finger, his energy penetrated Do Hyeon-soo's right knee.\nAnd as he was running towards Chun Yeowun collapsed.\nChun Yeowun aimed his index finger at Du Hyeon-soo's forehead.\n\"It doesn't seem like you have better techniques, so let's end this.\"\nAnd the moment she snapped.\nKwakwakwag!\nAt that moment, the floor cracked and sand rose up.\n'This?'\nAs the sand was alive, it changed to the shape of a hand. This wasn't an illusion but was actually happening.\n\"The power of spirit.\"\nChun Yeowun could feel the spiritual energy moving in the sand.\nThis was Earth qi.\nSince the Imoogi was known to be an earth spirit, it could control the land.\n'In this short time, he was able to use the energy?'\nThis was similar to how Mun Ran-yeong and Hu Bong took the spirit energy by drinking the blood of the Flame Qilin.\nSo Do Hyeon-soo pretended to clench his fists. His palm-shaped hand hardened and the earthen sand grabbed Chun Yeowun trying to crush him.\nBut,\nChachachk!\nThe sand froze before it even reached Chun Yeowun.\n\"Surrrr!\"\nDo Hyeon-soo raised more Earth qi and tried to bring in sand, but everything around them had frozen.\nAnd that was enough to make Do Hyeon-soo, who was blinded with the power ranging in him, turn shocked.\nBefore he realized it, Chun Yeowun stood in front of him.\n\"When there is a problem with the mind, there is nothing more effective than this one.\"\nBefore Chun Yeowun was done, Do Hyeon-soo tried to run away. It was because he instinctively knew that he couldn't face Chun Yeowun.\nGrab!\nChun Yeowun grabbed the man's head as he was about to run.\n\"Shhhh!\"\nDo Hyeon-soo was back to making snake-like sounds and struggled, but Chun Yeowun's hands were bringing out Thunder qi.\nCrackle!\n\"Kukakaka!\"\nDo Hyeon-soo, who was hit with lightning, screamed.\nAs if his brain was burned, red and yellow liquid flowed from his eyes, nose and ears, along with black smoke.\nThud!\nDo Hyeon-so collapsed to the ground once the Thunder qi was stopped.\nIt was difficult to describe the face which lost its hair because of the shock.\nHowever, the spiritual energy of Imoogi didn't let him die.\nShhh!\nHis wounds, which were burned, were clearing off.\nAnd in less than 10 minutes, even the burnt hair was back to its original state.\nAnd not long after, Do Hyeon-soo stood up like he was fine.\n\"Kuak!\"\nAnd when he woke up, he remembered everything that had happened to him.\nHe was able to recall all of the damaged parts of the brain which was destroyed by the Imoogi blood, and was amazed at Chun Yeowun's power.\n'Did I make a mess?'\nDrinking the blood of Imoogi, he destroyed himself and exploded like a child.\nWas there ever a time when the Fist of the Emperor of the forces of Evil ever suffered so helplessly after that incident 600 years ago?\n\"W-who might you be? You…\"\nChun Yeowun answered.\n\"The Great Sky Demon Order's Chun Ma.\"\nThe main hall of Black Athena. It looked like an all-out war waged out there.\nEverywhere was full of dents and cracks and people in their waiter outfits lying on the floor.\n\"Eh, is this the last one?\"\nPak!\nHu Bong pulled the sword from the waist of a middle-aged man.\nBi Mak-heon looked at Hu Bong in respect. His Sword of Illusion technique was perfect.\nEvery time he used the Sword of Illusion technique, the flames would rage, fitting his nickname, Flame Emperor.\n\"As expected from my teacher!\"\nHu Bong shrugged at Bi Mak-heon's praise.\n\"Uh-hum.\"\nHe was infinitely weak to praise.\n\"Hmm, if you study swordsmanship a couple of times, your skills will improve by a lot.\"\n\"Ah really?\"\nIn fact, Bi Mak-heon's skills had improved when compared to before.\nHowever, Yu So-hwa didn't like the way these two were complimenting each other, and shook her head while saying.\n\"This place seems to have been cleaned, let's head inside.\"\nIf they went ahead, an alarm would go off and people would come rushing out.\nThere was no difficulty in disposing of these men, but there was one thing.\n\"Hehe, Miss Yu, there is no need for that.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nHu Bong directed her towards the reception room entrance, and Chun Yeowun walked out from there.\nBehind him were two people, the SS-class Keeper Im So-hye and a gray-haired man, Master of Black Athena, who seemed to be in his early thirties.\n\"Lord, did it go well?\"\n\"Right.\"\n\"But those two?\"\nAt Hu Bong's shock, Chun Yeowun responded.\n\"This is Do Hyeon-woo, the head of Black Athena, who was newly brought into our Cult.\"\nDo Hyeon-soo bowed and greeted them.\n\"I was shown great grace which I would never be able to repay, so I have joined the Sky Demon Order. Please take care of me.\"\n'Ehhh?'\nBi Mak-heon couldn't hide his shock.\nHe thought the deal went sour, but now Chun Yeowun ate up the entire Black Athena. One of the two largest organizations!\n'… why is that bitch?'\nYu So-hwa was puzzled when she saw Im So-hye, who couldn't look into her eyes and kept her eyes down.\nUntil a while ago, she was acting arrogant in front of her, but now she seemed to be acting like a criminal.\nAt that time, Chun Yeowun said.\n\"New secretary. As the first one, you will educate her yourself. Greet her.\"\nAt those words, Im So-hye's face turned red. Her self-esteem was seriously damaged.\nAs an SS-class Keeper, to be turned into a mere secretary! In addition, to be placed under Yu So-hwa!!\n\"Don't make me say it twice.\"\nAt Chun Yeowun's cold words, Im So-hye flinched and bowed her head.\n\"P-Please treat me well. Senior.\"\nAt that, Im So-hye's eyes caught the corners of Yu So-hwa's lips turning up into a smile.",

      "content": "Chapter 123: Tempting Night (1)\nAround 9 in the evening.\nIn the training hall within the Yongchun site.\nTwo people were fighting in there.\nPapapak!\nThe sounds of clashing in the air.\nThe trajectory of each attack would change in various forms when the footwork changed, but the opponent couldn't be hit properly.\n'Need a break. By using an unexpected blow!'\nPak! Shh!\n'Huh?'\nHowever, the lightning-like kick came through.\n'I am using it the same way, but why is there such a difference?'\nBaek Jong-so, the leader of the Pure Kick clan, continued to practice a technique.\nFollowing Chun Yeowun, he came to this site with his mother and was currently focusing on training his martial arts.\n'I need to get stronger.'\nDespite his name as the leader of the highest sect, he was extremely weak.\nHe was honing his skills day and night to overcome that, but he would constantly blame himself for not getting the desired results.\n\"Too cluttered.\"\n\"S-Sorry.\"\nTatatak!\nThe person he was fighting against was none other than Mun Ran-yeong.\nAs an amazing expert in her clan's techniques, she was dealing with Baek Jong-so in a leisurely manner.\n'Certainly stricter than teacher Hu Bong.'\nThe one who originally trained him was Hu Bong.\nAfter being ordered to teach Baek Jong-so and Bi Mak-heon, Hu Bong taught them in his spare time. However, he was now away, so his wife was helping.\n'I am envious!'\nThe other people were envious of this. There was no way they wouldn't be jealous of the guy who was being taught martial arts by such a strong person.\nPapak!\n\"Euk!\"\nWith just her light gestures, Baek Jong-so was thrown all over the hall.\nJust by looking at his muddy clothes, one could tell how many times he had rolled on the floor.\n'Did she really tailor her skills to my level?'\nThe way she dealt with him made him suspicious. It was difficult to even move his body.\n'I thought I managed to improve.'\nYesterday, he had even absorbed the energy from the refined core.\nDespite all his effort and growth, the situation didn't seem to change at all, and he couldn't see any difference.\n\"You don't seem to get it.\"\n\"Ah…\"\nMun Ran-yeong spoke to Baek Jong-so as if she could read his thoughts.\n\"If you use the internal energy, you should be able to use it more efficiently, but you are too straightforward and aggressive when using the techniques.\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"The stronger you come out, the easier it is to use gentle force to divert it. Even if I don't have to use the full extent of my skills, I can just use your reckless power to stop you.\"\nMun Ran-yeong barely used her internal energy.\nThere was a technique where the person used the opponent's movement and force to deal with them without using anything of their own.\nAnd this was something she managed to realize once she entered the Divine Master level and began to feel the energy around her.\n'If you can realize that, you will be on the verge of aiming for the Supreme Master level, but if you can't, then this is your limit.'\nShe couldn't give everything the man wanted. He would have to figure it out by himself.\nAnd Baek Jong-so didn't catch onto the clue.\n'It would have been better if master Baekgi taught him.'\nSince this was the Pure Kick clan which dealt with close combat, if Baekgi was here, he could understand the man and tell things more easily.\n‘Haa… is master Baekgi fine?’\nEvery time she thought of him, she was worried for his life. Despite trusting Chun Yeowun, she couldn't help but worry for him.\n\"Please come at me once again.\"\nBaek Jong-so got up and asked.\nMun Ran-yeong relaxed her posture and then looked at the man who was gasping for air.\n\"Let's stop here for today.\"\n\"Ah…\"\nBaek Jong-so put on a sad expression. However, he couldn't ask her to continue since she had already been training him for 3 hours.\nSo he thanked her.\n\"Thank you.\"\nMun Ran-yeong advised Baek Jong-so to stop for the day, but he said he would practice more.\nSo leaving him behind, she left.\nAnd once she did, Baek Jong-so tried to take time to understand the flow and technique.\nSince he was the only one left, it was nice and quiet.\n'The fact that the 3rd form shook indicates there is a problem with my footwork. Let's focus on that.'\nIt was when Baek Jong-so was thinking about it that he saw the shadow of someone enter.\n'Huh?'\nHe was puzzled by the form, which looked like a woman with long hair.\n'Great Elder?'\nHe was too tired.\nFrom what he saw, he realized that he couldn't feel energy from the person, so he thought it had to be Mun Ran-yeong or Hang Yurin.\n'But the clothes are odd?'\nIt didn't seem like Mun Ran-yeong. The clothes this person wore were clearly showing off the silhouette.\n'Who?'\nAs he thought, the woman came further in.\n\"Who… ah!\"\nIn an instant, Baek Jong-so exclaimed.\nIt was his first time seeing this woman.\nHowever, she had an exotic appearance with shiny silver hair that looked like it was sprinkled with jewels.\nIn addition, he was captivated by the tight and sexy clothes which showed off her breasts. He wasn't the kind to act this way towards women, but this one had a charm.\nHis alertness immediately softened.\n\"I am using this place right now. Who might you be?\"\nAt that question, the woman closed the door of the hall.\n\"Well. Does it matter who I am?\"\nBaek Jong-so's eyes fluttered at the alluring voice which seduced him. The silver-haired woman slowly walked towards Baek Jong-so while touching her breasts.\nAround 10:15 in the Youngchun group headquarters.\nThere was a middle-aged man turning his tired head to relax it.\nIt was Chun Yu-jang, the chairman of the Yongchun Group.\nHe was on his way to go down after sending the staff off.\n\"Sigh.\"\nBecause of the merger that was going on, he didn't have much time for himself.\nStill, more than half of the merger was done. And he did worthwhile work.\n'Should I head home, have a glass of drink and sleep?'\nHe was too tired to do anything else. He thought of inviting someone to have a drink, but everyone was exhausted with work.\n'When will father's closed room training be done?'\nWhen the training was done, he wanted to have a drink with his father like in the old days.\n'These are the times I wish for a son.'\nChun Yu-jang had one son.\nHowever, the son betrayed his hopes and expectations as he left for France.\nIt was such a sad relationship between them. It only consisted of checking if the other person was alive or not and the occasional sending of money.\n'… would it have been different if Ae-ran was alive?'\nChun Yu-jang's wife died of an incurable disease shortly after the son was born.\nEven without a mother, he tried his best to raise his son, but after the incident 27 years back, everything shattered.\n'So lonely.'\nHe pretended to be strong on the outside, but he was always lonely.\nThe feeling of going into a house where he wouldn't feel lonely.\n'Have I ever thought of getting married again?'\nAs a courtesy to his dead wife, he decided to stay single until the revival of the Sky Demon Order, but he was a human too.\n\"Phew.\"\nAs he sighed, the elevator stopped.\nDingdong!\nHe noticed that the elevator was pushed to the 7th floor.\n'It seems there are people that haven't left work yet.'\nDuring these days, the employees were also overworked due to the merger. Even the chairman himself didn't have time to relax.\nAnd when the elevator reached the floor, he saw someone inside.\n'Ah!'\nChun Yu-jang sighed.\nA silver-haired woman with an exotic appearance and the most revealing clothes that made Chun Yu-jang turn his gaze away.\nCoughing, he looked away.\n\"Uhm! Uhm!\"\nThe woman got in, and Chun Yu-jang slightly moved away.\n'Hm?'\nChun Yu-jang frowned. Her appearance definitely moved him, but he couldn't figure out who this woman was.\nIt was impossible for their company to have foreign staff, and it was too late for them to have guests.\n\"Excuse me…\"\nChun Yu-jang turned his head and tried to ask her who she was, when he went silent.\nThe silver-haired woman with a revealing top was looking at him with seductive eyes. And when he looked at her bra, Chun Yu-jang turned his head in embarrassment.\n\"Kum! Miss, what are you doing? Miss.\"\nHis heart was beating strangely. It had been so long, he couldn't even remember the last time he was with a woman. The silver-haired woman spoke something more shocking.\n\"Excuse me… have you ever done it in an elevator?\"\nA seductive voice.\n'!!!'\nAnd the moment he heard it, Chun Yu-jang's reasoning flew out of the window. He grabbed her face and kissed her as if he knew her.\nTheir Tongues intertwined like snakes.\nHe lifted her right thigh up and pushed her against the elevator wall.\nThud!\nThe elevator shook. As if waiting for this moment, the woman raised her other leg and wrapped it around Chun Yu-jang's waist.\nThere was a constant sound of thumping from the elevator that went down.\nDingdong!\nThe elevator stopped on the 1st floor, but the door stayed closed with the constant sound of thrusting.\nAround five minutes passed.\nThe inside of the elevator was heated in excitement.\nLooking inside the mirror, the woman adjusted her makeup and reapplied the lipstick.\n\"They said the chairman was delicious. And strong too.\"\nBehind her, Chun Yu-jang seemed to stand blankly. A silver haze inside his eyes.\n\"But you couldn't do it for long? The other ones lasted at least 15 minutes. Huhu.\"\nThose words would've hurt the pride of any man, but Chun Yu-jang didn't respond. She mumbled as she put the lipstick back in her bag.\n\"Should I stop with this much today? I even ate the chairman, so this should be enough.\"\nHumming, she pressed the open sign.\n\"The Vice-chairman would be delicious too. Huhuhu.\"\nClick.\nThe moment the door opened, her eyes widened. Two women were standing there.\nThe purple-haired Shakena and the red-haired Mun Ran-yeong.\nShakena raised her brows and asked.\n\"I was wondering where I was getting the smell of a slut, it was you?\"\n\"Heart hunter?\"\nPerhaps unaware of her being here, the silver-haired woman seemed shocked.\n\"3rd place in Count ranks?\"\nShakena slammed her fist with an annoyed expression.\nSwish!\nWhen someone stopped it.\nCrack!\nIt was Chun Yu-jang whose hand was broken.\nAlthough he had reached the Superior Master level, he didn't have the power to handle Shakena.\nYet, even when his hand broke, he showed no sign of being in pain.\n\"Vice-lord!\"\nShocked by his actions, Mun Ran-yeong yelled out. She didn't think that he would protect a woman who was an enemy.\n\"You! What did you do?\"\n\"Huhu, I turned him into my man, anything wrong with that? And… how long will you block her?\"\nThe silver-haired woman kicked the wall next to the elevator.\nBang!\nThe thick elevator opened, and she escaped through there. She slipped out of the lobby and flew outside.\n'Shakena is here!'\nDue to the existence of her clan's people, she decided to retreat.\nIf there was a clan member helping the Sky Demon order, then she had to be careful.\nHowever, Shakena blocked her.\n\"Yah! Who sent you, you horny bitch?\"\n\"Who are you calling a bitch?\"\n\"Should I call you a wench then ?\"\nShakena kicked her head. The silver-haired woman stopped it by lifting her wrist.\nPak!\n\"Stopped it?\"\nShakena was shocked. The silver woman had a Count title, but her fighting power wasn't strong.\nHowever, she was able to stop Shakena's kick?\n\"Shocked? How long did you think I would remain a low-rank one?\"\nAt the same time, the Silver-haired woman pierced her nails which were sharp like knives into Shakena's chest.\nShhh!\nShakena used phasing on her upper body.\n'Annoying ability!'\nThe silver-haired woman wanted to avoid this battle because of this ability. No matter how strong she got, if Shakena phased, then nothing could be done.\nIt was when Shakena aimed for the heart of the silver-haired woman…\nPath!\nThe silver-haired one spread the distance.\nAlthough no damage could be done, she wanted to run away a little further.\n\"Yah! Stop there!\"\n\"Huhuhu, if you can, try to catch me.\"\nThe silver-haired woman teased her and kept moving.\nUntil someone stopped in front of her, Mun Ran-yeong.\n\"Ha! From where did this human bitch…\"\nWheik!\nIn an instant, hands filled with flame pierced her abdomen.\n\"Damn it!\"\nBecause of the force of the attack, the silver-haired woman bounced back 10 meters.\nThud!\nShe barely stopped, and when she looked down at her burnt stomach, black smoke was coming out.\n'A human can hurt me?'\nMun Ran-yeong approached her with flames still fluttering in her hands.\n\"How could a human deal with you? Don't care about that. Release that control you have on the vice-lord.\"\n\"Haa…\"\nMun Ran-yeong in the front and Shakena in the back. The situation wasn't helpful.\n'How annoying! I didn't prepare it for this reason!'\nA trap was prepared for another reason, but now she was being forced to use it. The silver-haired woman raised her hand.\nAnd a silver light spread out in all directions.\nShhh!\n\"What is that?\"\nShakena wanted to know what it was and she soon did.\nSwosh!\nAt that time, a group of men of the Sky Demon Order began to come.\nSome higher ones like Baek Jong-so were also there.\nStep! Step!\nEven Chun Yu-jang was walking out with his broken arm.\nSeeing that, Shakena muttered.\n\"Just how many people have you eaten?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 124: Tempting Night (2)\nCount Anas.\nShe was in the top 700 among the thousand Counts. Compared to the other clan members, her ability wasn’t fit for battles, but it was more tricky than one could think.\nBecause it had a tremendous impact on the males.\nCharm.\nLike a drug. Those who are seduced by her fall into her charms like insane people.\nAnd since all their five senses turn dull, they obey her orders.\n“Vice-lord. Calm yourself!”\nDespite Mun Ran-yeong’s words, the chairman Chun Yu-jang was unable to regain his senses.\nIt was the same for the other Cult members. All had silver eyes, and looked like they were sleepwalking.\n“No use. Unnie. We need to get rid of that bitch to get them back to normal.”\nShakena, who was well aware of Anas’ abilities, knew that dealing with her was the right move.\n“If you can kill all these people, then come at me.”\nAs soon as Anas’ words fell, the seduced Cult members rushed towards Shakena and Mun Ran-yeong.\nPhat!\nAs they rushed in, Mun Ran-yeong was flustered.\nIf she attacked them with flame, they would definitely suffer from fatal wounds, so she responded with bare hands.\nPapak!\nThe Cult members were hit by her with light gestures. She wished it would end like that, but since they didn’t feel any pain, they kept getting up like a spring.\n“Jong-so!”\nAmong them was Baek Jong-so.\nBaek Jong-so, who began to unfold the technique, rushed at her with determination to kill.\n‘When he was mentally sane, he couldn’t fight like this.’\nAfter his alertness and fear for the other person disappeared, the connection of the technique was more natural.\nIt was truly ironic.\nEven if the back of the neck was hit, those who should have fainted were walking up like zombies.\nThe enchantment didn’t end with controlling the men, it could also make them walk to their death.\n“Shit!”\nNormally, she would have killed the opponent, but Shakena remembered Chun Yeowun’s words, so she couldn’t take the risk.\nShhh!\nShe was contemplating on what to do while avoiding Chun Yu-jang and the others who kept attacking her.\nShe wanted to kill the woman right away.\nAs if understanding her anxiousness, Anas mocked.\n“Try your best against the slaves!”\nAfter spouting those sarcastic words, she tried to run away again.\nThat was when Shakena thought of a good way.\n“Jump, Unnie!”\n“Huh?”\nAt Shakena’s shout, Mun Ran-yeong jumped up. And Shakena put her hands on the floor.\nA radius of 100 meters was dyed in purple, and soon, it was phased.\nAs a result, some of the members standing in that place fell in.\n‘Now!’\nThe phasing was released and the people were pulled into the ground till their upper chest.\nThanks to that, those who were trapped couldn’t move.\n“Well done!”\nPhat!\nWithout missing the chance, Mun Ran-yeong sprinted ahead.\nAfter reaching Anas, who was desperately running away, she reached out and used flame spheres.\n“Huh?”\nThe moment Anas discovered it, she held out her hand which made silver magical spheres appear.\nThe two simultaneously used it on each other.\nSwosh!\nBang!\nWhen they collided, the spheres exploded in the air. It seemed like they were on the same level.\nHowever,\nWoong!\nThe flame sphere which shattered passed through the one created by Anas and fell.\nWhen she saw that, Anas tried to avoid it.\nAnd she bounced back and forth like a cat trying to avoid it.\n‘How can a human have this kind of power?’\nShe couldn’t believe it.\nShe couldn’t believe it when she heard that Chun Mu-seong had killed Kyle.\nHowever, she didn’t think that another human who could handle her race would be there.\nPhat!\nAt that time, Mun Ran-yeong jumped down from the front. Anas tried to kick her, but.\nPapak!\nMun Ran-yeong skillfully wrapped the kick like a snake with her hand and aimed for Anas’ stomach again.\nPuck!\n“Kuak!”\nThis time too, she was pushed back by 5 steps.\nMun Ran-yeong was shocked.\nShe was determined to kill this woman, but it didn’t seem like the woman took much damage apart from the black smoke. There were no injuries.\n‘No internal organs then?’\nIf that wasn’t the case, the woman couldn’t be standing like this.\nShe knew this woman wasn’t human, but she didn’t think her body would be this strange.\n‘Then…’\nMun Ran-yeong turned her gaze to Anas’ chest.\nSince too many things happened, she had forgotten about it, but Chun Yeowun did tell that if Demons came, she would have to aim for their core.\n‘Aim for the chest!’\nPhat!\nShe moved like lightning towards Anas.\nThis time, she was aiming for the chest, but Anas crossed her hands and pulled out her sharp claws.\nPapak!\nThey crossed each other’s hands and bumped.\nSurprisingly, Anas knew martial arts. She used a technique to avoid being hit.\n“Martial arts?”\nAt her puzzlement, Anas shouted at her.\n“Did you think that only humans could do this?”\nShe tried to claw Mun Ran-yeong’s face, but Mun Ran-yeong leaned back and kicked her in the chin.\nPuck!\nAnas, who was kicked, tried to resist the pain and stabbed Mun Ran-yeong with a nail in the back.\nShe was aiming to cut off her spine, but because of the flames around her body, her nails were burning black.\n“Shit!”\nAnas tried to avoid the flames and spread the distance between them again.\nIn that brief exchange, both had fatal looks.\n‘Annoying! If only this bitch was a male, everything could be resolved!’\nAnas was flustered. The biggest downside of her ability was that it didn’t work on females.\nAlthough she could seduce a person of the same sex, she wasn’t interested in women, so she never used it.\n‘Tch. This is a battle of time.’\nAnas glanced at Shakena.\nShakena had buried most of the members in the ground and was dealing with other strong ones, including Chun Yu-jang.\nShe tried to trap him in the ground too, but he seemed to have managed to escape it.\nHowever, it didn’t seem like they would last long against her.\nIt was then, Mun Ran-yeong’s hands reached her chest.\n“Huh!”\nPhat!\nAnas flew back to avoid it. She thought that she was far enough, but as she moved back, an opaque form of a hand reached to her chest with flames around it.\nIt was an Invisible Palm embodied with Flame qi.\nWheiik!\n“Ack!”\nUnable to avoid it, the palm struck her chest.\nBlack smoke rose from her mouth as if Anas’ core was hit. She couldn’t hide her shock.\n‘This bitch? Knows about the core?’\nOtherwise, she wouldn’t be aiming for that spot with that attack.\nAnas was genuinely shocked.\n‘To a human girl, who lived for only 20 years, I lost?’\nUnfortunately, Mun Ran-yeong was older.\nAnd even older because of the recent hibernation. She was probably twice Anas’ age.\nIn any case, since her life was in danger, there was one single choice.\nPhat!\nShe flew without looking back.\nThe only way to survive.\n“How dare you?”\nMun Ran-yeong jumped into the air and tried to deliver one last blow. It was then.\nShhh!\n‘!?’\nSomeone appeared in front of her and stopped her.\nHe kicked Mun Ran-yeong with his two legs.\nPak!\nShe crossed her arms, yet she fell to the ground because of the power of the kick.\nBang!\nAs she fell down, a 10-meter hole was created. Fortunately, she didn’t suffer any internal injuries.\n‘Who?’\nIt was someone else.\nShhh!\nAnd then, a figure appeared before her.\nThe man had light blue hair and was wearing glasses.\nHe gave off an exotic feel.\nAs if interested, he mumbled.\n“You withstood a blow with the intent to kill. Are you human?”\n“I see you are a demon too.”\nMun Ran-yeong immediately guessed.\nIf this man was a Murim, she could have felt internal energy within, but she couldn’t sense anything from this man.\n“You are quick-witted.”\nThe man smiled and said.\nAnas, who found him, spoke in a shocked expression.\n“Martin!”\nThe glasses man was ‘that person’. So she was wondering why he was here when he should be somewhere else.\nShhh!\n“Is the core safe? Anas.”\n“Ah! Hale… you too?”\nThe man in the gray coat with a ponytail was also a demon. Anas who didn’t understand asked\n“Just how?”\n“He foresaw this.”\nAt the words of a demon called Hale, her expression darkened.\n“So he couldn’t believe me?”\n“Don’t be offended. It is just that your abilities are imperfect. That was why he sent us to annihilate the one called Chun Mu-seong for sure.”\nDespite putting it politely, it was the same.\nIn the end, that person couldn’t believe Anas and came up with another plan.\nBut thanks to that, she was alive now.\n“… fine.”\n“But it is unexpected. He didn’t know that the pursuers of the clan were cooperating with humans. A person with the highest ability of a Count… Heart Hunter.”\nShe was the most powerful Count, she ranked 3rd.\nSo now, they thought that Chun Mu-seong was able to deal with the previous demon with her help.\n“Ha!”\nJust like Hale was shocked, Shakena was also shocked at the demons who appeared now.\n‘Did they also surrender to the traitor?’\nBefore she came, a lot of trackers were sent in. and she assumed that they were all dead, but it didn’t seem like that was the case.\n‘What? This power…’\nShakena frowned at the ominous demonic power rising from the two demons. She knew this better than anyone.\n“You people! You ate your own kind!”\nPhat!\nLeaving Chun Yu-jang aside, she flew into the air and threw her fist at Hale.\nHale lightly blocked it with his palm. At that, Shakena’s eyes fluttered.\n‘Someone in his 800 is blocking my fist?’\nThe demon called Hale was lower than Anas. Yet, Shakena’s fist didn’t work.\n“Heart Hunter. Long time no see.”\n“You…”\n“You used to look strong in the past… but not so much now.”\nBulge!\nBlack veins began to bulge on the face of the demon Hale.\nThis was a phenomenon that would happen after preying on their own kind.\nWhen they did, their strength would rise and in order to cope with it, their bodies would experience some changes as well.\nAnd this phenomenon was called.\n“Forced Awakening!”",

      "content": "Chapter 125: Tempting Night (3)\nAmong the demons, those of the Marquis rank were known to have a Demonic Power Awakening.\nHowever, this Forced Awakening would only happen through predation of one’s own kind.\nWhich meant that the power inside them was impure.\n“How strong will I be if I eat the Heart Hunter?”\nHale licked his lips with a sinister smile.\nAt that, Shakena shouted.\n“To think someone like you will beat me!”\nWith her phased body, she tried to put her hand inside Hale’s chest.\nBut Hale smiled with strong sparks rising from his body.\nCrackle!\n“Kuak!”\nThe sparks prevented the molecules from breaking down, and the phasing didn’t work.\nShakena couldn’t hide her dismay.\n“Is this your ability?”\n“Kuak, don’t tell me that only the demonic powers would increase if we eat our own kind?”\nHale slammed his fist into Shakena’s face.\nPuck! Crack!\nWith a cracking sound, Shakena, who was hit, fell to the ground. It was just one blow, but the tremendous power it held made her body dig deep into the ground.\n“Shakena!”\nMun Ran-yeong shouted, and the demon named Martin standing in front of her, grinned.\n“Worry about the one who is ahead of you. Human bitch!”\nWith that, Martin’s form disappeared from her sight.\nStrictly speaking, he didn’t disappear. He was just moving at a speed that was invisible to naked eyes.\n‘Fast.’\nMun Ran’yeongs eyes couldn’t look at the opponent’s movements.\nShe normally was the kind to rely on sight and hearing, but now she couldn’t feel anything from martin.\n‘Then!’\nMun Ran-yeong engulfed her entire body with Fire qi.\nCovered in flames, she struck the floor with her palms, and huge pillars of flame soared high.\nWheik!\n“Ah! Hot!”\nMartin, who was moving around making fun of her, widened the distance as he was burned by flames.\nWhen Mun Ran-yeong spread out her hands to him as he widened the distance, an invisible field rose and an opaque hand spread out with the technique of her clans.\n“You are pretty good for a human.”\nShhh!\nMartin’s body scattered in the air, and the distance increased further.\nHe reached out towards Mun Ran-yeong.\nAt that moment, a yellow smoke flowed from his hand and wrapped itself around the pillars of flames.\n‘What is this now?’\nThe moment the yellow smoke touched the flame, a strong explosion occurred.\nKwang! Bang!\nThe only reason Mun Ran-yeong could survive the explosion was that she was used to dealing with fire, but as it continued, her vision began to be obscured and her body began to fall.\n‘No!’\nIn the end, she had no choice but to call back the pillars of flame. As soon as the flames subsided, the entire area was covered with yellow smoke.\nShe tried to push the smoke away with wind.\nSting!\nWeirdly, her entire body ached and hurt.\nA Strange feeling.\nAt that, she looked at her hand and saw the skin was rotting away.\n“Poison?”\nShe wasn’t sure if it was poison, but it was definitely strong enough to rot her skin.\nHowever, she was someone who drank the blood of Flame Qilin, so she had excellent regenerative abilities, and her skin began healing.\nShhh!\n“Are you human? Corrosion doesn’t work. Then, how about this?”\nMartin’s voice, who has been watching her, could be heard from the smoke.\nSoon, the yellow smoke turned blue.\nCreepy!\nMun Ran-yeong felt something off about this smoke and tried to protect herself by unfolding a defense technique.\nIt was then.\nPuck!\n“Euk!”\nIn the smoke, there was a sound of someone being hit, and the one in the smoke was Martin.\n“W-what? How are you here….”\nGoooo! Pang!\n“Kuak!”\nWith a strong blue, the smoke around was swept away in all directions.\nIn an instant, her obscured vision was back to normal.\n“Ah!”\nIn Mun Ran-yeong’s eyes, she saw the man in glasses, who was supposed to be close to her, 20 meters away with his arms crossed and in shock.\nAnd far from him was someone in a black suit.\n“Lord Chun Ma!”\nIt was Chun Yeowun.\n“Ah! Is he the one?”\nAnas’ eyes were dazzling. She knew that this man was elsewhere, but he was here now.\n“I was right.”\nChun Yeowun said while looking around.\nFortunately, there didn’t seem to be any casualties.\n‘Ah! He really heard me!’\nMun Ran-yeong was surprised. A modified Nano Bomb was planted in her head.\nThrough that, he was informed that demons had appeared in the Yongchun group, and Chun Yewun arrived 15 minutes after that.\nMartin lowered his arms and then straightened his posture.\n“You must be that one.”\nHe pretended to be as relaxed as he could, but he was extremely alert.\nThe blow he received from Chun Yeowun was quite shocking.\n‘I didn’t block with full strength, but that one is no ordinary human!’\nBulge!\nBlack beings began to bulge on the face of Martin too.\nThe body muscles began to develop one after another, and ominous energy began to spread.\nMatin, who looked at Chun Yeowun, said.\n“It is an honor for a human to fall victim to Awakening. I’ll chop you and eat you up right away! For the trouble you caused!”\nShhh!\nMartin’s form disappeared in the air. Due to the Awakening, the movements had turned a lot faster than before\n“Lord! He is no ordinary enemy!”\nAt Mun Ran-yeong’s worries, Chun Yeowun said.\n“Don’t worry about it and help Shakena.”\nKwang!\nOn the other side, a fierce battle was making a building collapse. Shakena was struggling with the demon who had Awakened too.\n“Yes!”\nPhat!\nAnd so, Mun Ran-yeong immediately moved there.\nWhen he saw that, Martin smiled.\n‘He must be foolish to think he can deal with me on his own. Kukukuk! In front of my high-speed movement, he won’t be able to do anything.’\nMartin was so fast that everything around seemed standing still as if time had stopped.\nChun Yeowun also seemed still. Which meant he couldn’t see Martin.\n‘Let’s kill him!’\nMartin, who kept spinning around, ran for Chun Yeowun from the side. And then tried to kick his neck.\nBut then, something happened.\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun’s eyes turned, and he looked at where he was standing.\n‘Uh?’\nHe thought it had to be a coincidence that this man knew where he was. It was flustering, but he already was ready to use the power on the kick and couldn’t stop it.\n‘Doesn’t matter. Even if he can see, he can’t stop it.’\nEven if he could guess the place, stopping a kick loaded with demonic power would be a different thing.\nPang! Pang! Pang!\nThe moment his kick was about to land on Chun Yeowun’s neck, breaking through the air.\nTak!\nChun Yeowun grabbed the ankle.\n‘How?’\nChun Yeowun clenched his fist and aimed at the chest of the demon.\nThe space around the fist began to tremble.\n‘No! It is dangerous!’\nIn order to prevent it, Martin crossed his arms and covered his chest.\nCrack!\nHis wrist, which was right above the chest, was slowly tearing apart.\n‘!?’\nAnd then, through the torn part, Chun Yeowun’s fist hit the chest right where the core was located.\nPuck! Crack!\nMartin’s face contorted as he felt the breast bones breaking inside of him.\n‘Kuaaaak!’\nBoth eyes widened at what happened. The moment the pain hit him, the time which slowed for him started to move again.\nPuck!\nChun Yeowun’s fist which pierced the chest made Martin open his mouth.\n“Kuak… auk…”\nHe muttered something at Chun Yeowun.\n“This… I was going to leave that behind.”\nDue to the destructive power of the fist, which was unified with the internal energy and the energy of nature, the core was completely destroyed.\n“You… are… you really… human…”\nPsss!\nBefore he could ask, Martin’s body cracked and black smoke erupted from it as it crumbled into ashes.\nSeeing that, Anas couldn’t help but be shocked.\n‘No way….’\nAmong them, Martin had the power of a Marquis. But such a person was turned into ashes in the blink of an eye.\nAnas’ body trembled.\nBut it wasn’t out of fear. The corners of her lips raised into a smile at the excitement of seeing this man.\nThis was a reaction different from feeling bad about the death of a colleague.\n‘Strong! Strong! Amazingly strong!’\nShe was so fascinated with Chun Yeowun’s strength that her entire body shuddered. It wasn’t like she was in love.\nWhat filled her eyes was greed.\n‘If I eat him, I might be on the same level as a Duke!’\nThey all gain strength by eating the strong.\nAnd seeing Chun Yeowun, she was eager to have him.\n‘Hohoho.’\nHer charms made the males want her. Even if that doesn’t work well with demons, it has a 100% success rate with humans.\nTat!\nAnas reached the ground and quickly approached Chun Yeowun.\n‘Me! Mine!’\nOnce the man fell in love with her, he would be her slave.\nJust the thought made her happy.\nSwaying her hips, she approached him with an alluring expression and said.\n“You are really strong. And a strong man is attractive. Huhu.”\nPlacing her index finger in her mouth, she pretended to suck on it, as if implying to take that thing into her mouth.\nSilver energy began to emanate from her body and flowed towards Chun Yeowun.\nTo captivate all his five senses.\n“What do you think? Do you want to enter me?”\n“Really? Don’t complain then.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, with a smiling face, she gently widened the gap between her thighs.\n“Come into me….”\nIt was then.\nKwak!\n“Kuak!”\nAnas lowered her head in pain.\nSomething was inside her.\nHowever, it was the hand of Chun Yeowun which pierced her chest and not the place she had hoped for.\n“You are a unique demon. Now that I know, I need to end this.”\n“N… Not… the… there… kuak!”\nUnfortunately, her ability didn’t work on this man. As the core which was connected to her body was severed, she mumbled with an absurd expression.\n“It isn’t… like you… are… a crazy…. Eunuch…!”",

      "content": "Chapter 126: Tempting Night (4)\n\"Tch tch, what a worthless ability.\"\nChun Yeowun recalled the ability. He thought that Anas had the ability to brainwash seeing how the members of the Cult were in her grasp and absorbed it, but it was useless.\nThere was no way that Chun Yeowun would be seduced by someone. Well, Anas' body disappeared, and the Cult members who were under her grasp were back to normal.\n'What? Why… is my arm?'\nChun Yu-jang, who was back to normal, looked at the broken arm, unable to understand anything.\nIt was the same for others. Those who were buried into the ground till their chests had no idea what happened.\n\"W-what?\"\n\"Why are we here?\"\nIn fact, the last thing they remembered was.\nA silver-haired woman trying to seduce them. But since then, all their memories were blank, and they couldn't try to remember them either.\n\"Ancestor!\"\nChun Yu-jang found Chun Yeowun and approached him by holding the cracked arm. At that, Chun Yeowun said.\n\"Ancestor how…\"\nKwakwang!\nBefore he could ask, a roar of blasts could be heard.\nAnd when he looked at it, it was the Yongchun Group building which was demolished.\nFortunately, there were no people in that place as it was a training hall, but it was too sudden.\n\"What the hell…\"\n\"Guard the members of the Cult who were here.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nLeaving him, Chun Yeowun moved towards the building which was destroyed.\nMeanwhile, a fierce battle is raging over there.\nBang!\nA huge mass of flames exploded.\nThrough the gap, the muscular demon, Hale, with black veins bulging on his body, walked out.\n\"Kuak!\"\nAn annoyed sound from Hale.\n'To do this!'\nUntil he was fighting alone with Shakena, he had the upper hand. However, once Mun Ran-yeong entered, the situation changed.\n\"Haa!\"\nMun Ran-yeong went towards him.\nHale's body turned dark red and hardened. One of the two abilities he had, Hardening.\nKanG!\nEven if this wasn't changed, he could take on the flame woman who was coming for him.\nHowever, there was someone else who kept aiming at him.\nShh!\n'This bitch!'\nIt was Shakena.\nShe, who used her phasing ability, was constantly aiming for the core, so he used hardening.\nIn that case, he had no choice but to use electric shock once again.\nCrackle!\n\"Tch!\"\nShe avoided it. Not missing that chance, Mun Ran-yeong aimed for the chest.\nPang!\n\"Kuak!\"\nBlack smoke erupted from Hale's mouth. This was the problem.\nThe working of the two women together didn't go well with him.\nUnfortunately, he couldn't use both abilities at the same time, so he had to constantly change each time depending on the woman.\n\"These damned wenches!\"\nEnduring the pain, he kicked Mun Ran-yeong.\nPuck!\nIt was to prevent her from making any more attacks, and Mun Ran-yeong was thrown into the air 10 meters away.\nMun Ran-yeong used the internal energy and stopped herself from flying further away and giving him time to recover.\n'A little more and we can subdue him.'\nShe felt like this was a good time.\nThe hardening ability was definitely annoying, but Shakena was decent when it came to hitting him.\nAnd she wasn't the only one who was thinking.\n'No. this can't keep going on.'\nHale thought that he might die if this fight went on.\nAnd from the moment he thought that, his fighting spirit disappeared.\nRunning away seemed the best chance to survive, but.\n[You must understand why I kept you guys alive instead of eating you.]\nHe remembered what that person said.\nIf he went back without results, there would be a price to pay.\nWhatever it was, he was bound to be punished.\n'Damn it! Fine. Then I'd go down with two blasted wenches!'\nAs if he decided something, his eyes changed.\nCrack!\nHale bit his teeth. And his eyes which had been dyed in black till then were now red.\nShakena, who noticed that, went stiff.\n'That?'\nShe knew what that meant, so she hurriedly moved back and shouted at Mun Ran-yeong who was going towards him.\n\"Unnie! Run away! He is trying to self-destruct!\"\n\"Self-destruct?\"\nThe veins bulging out were turning red. It was a phenomenon where the core would reverse the flow.\nNormal demons wouldn't be able to do it, but these ones had awakened themselves so they could do it.\n\"Then he needs to be stopped!\"\nDespite Shakena's plea, Mun Ran-yeong went towards Hale.\nAlthough self-destruction was possible, there were too many Cult members right outside.\nAnd she couldn't let them die.\n'Invisible Palm!'\nShe tried to suppress the force of the explosion by creating an invisible field of energy around Hale.\nHale, who felt the invisible field around him, smiled and mumbled.\n\"You are late., human bitch!\"\nAt the same time, the runaway was already done, and Hale caused the explosion.\nPapapak!\nTremendous energy exploded from his body, and he moved towards Mun Ran-yeong. Shakena caught Mun Ran-yeong before he could and flew away.\n\"I told you to run away!\"\nShhh!\nAs she held Mun Ran-yeong, she used her phasing to make sure no one hit them.\nThe explosion was a kind of physical energy phenomenon that could be transmitted through her phasing too.\nKwakwakwang!\nEverything around Hale would be destroyed.\n'No!'\nIt was right then.\nWoong!\nThe space around Hale distorted and rotated. And as if a black hole opened, a strong force was generated and the energy of explosion was sucked into it.\nSwoosh!\nAnd that prevented the explosion from happening around.\nHale's eyes widened at that.\n'How is that possible?'\nAs he was confused, someone appeared.\n'H-he is?'\nIt was Chun Yeowun.\nDue to the destructive energy, the aftermath of the explosion seemed severe around him, but Chun Yeowun was able to block any of it from happening.\n\"You seem to be doing everything you can think of.\"\nChun Yeowun approached him by shaking his head.\nThe explosion kept flowing back and was sucked into space.\n'How is he?'\nAs he was shocked, Chun Yeowun went closer and put his hand on his head. And at that moment, tremendous coldness seeped into Hale's body.\nJjjkkkk!\n\"Auk!\"\nHis entire body went white and the explosion stopped. The explosion didn't go past 10 meters.\nChun Yeowun's hand then pierced the chest of Hale, who was frozen and shocked.\nCrack!\nAnd grabbed the swollen core.\n\"Hot.\"\nShhhh!\nProbably because of the sudden runaway power, the core was hot.\nDespite Chun Yeowun protecting his palm with internal energy, the heat could be felt.\n\"Can it be absorbed in this state too?\"\nChun Yeowun, who pulled it out, brought it close to the wrist guard.\nWoong!\nThe Sky Demon Sword resonated.\nThe swollen core little by little began to seep into the guard and the information flooded into Chun Yeowun's mind.\n\"Ha!\"\nShakena and Mun Ran-yeong, who watched that, were shocked.\n\"Unnie… is master really human?\"\nIt was her first time seeing someone stop a self-destructing demon this way.\nBut there was one more thing.\n'What is that wrist guard? It absorbed the core once again!'\nShe knew that it was weird as she saw Kyle's core being absorbed the last time.\nAnd it did that again, which meant that the wrist guard wasn't normal.\nMeanwhile.\nA gorgeous office with a night view in Gwangju.\nThe face of the man in the shadow who was looking outside while drinking wine went stiff.\nHis heart connected to three demons was cut off.\n'Unbelievable.'\nJust in case, he even sent two awakened ones that have preyed on their own kind.\nAnd he thought those three would be able to handle the strongest humans, but this was unexpected.\n'Did a human get rid of two Marquis-level demons?'\nIt was impossible. If it was a Marquis level, then only the Divine Master level Murim could get rid of them.\nBesides, if the two demons worked together, then any human would fall.\nHe assumed this human to be on the same level as the Five Great Warriors, but it seemed like he was stronger than that.\n-My King. Did something happen?\nA small voice echoed in the air. The man standing in the shadows drinking the wine said.\n\"All the clan members sent to kill him are dead.\"\n-Huh? No way? We sent two Awakened ones.\n\"Right.\"\nA moment of silence and then the voice came from the air.\n-My King. I understand how you feel but wouldn't it be a problem if we lose more of our clan at such an important time? Why not try a different method?\n\"Different method?\"\n-Moving to the 3rd Restricted Area.\n3rd Restricted Area, commonly called TRA, the area which was completely quarantined and closed.\nEven the government called it a forbidden place.\nThe man in the shadows said,\n\"It isn't a card to be used yet.\"\n-The image of the Murim association isn't good. Wouldn't it be better for us to crash it rather than wait and be more concerned?\n\"Well…\"\n-That is a difficult thing for us too. It wouldn't be something a human could handle. He is sure to die, but even if the human lives, the injuries would be hard to overlook and by that time, we can think of a plan and transfer the achievements to ourselves. The image of the Murim Association will also be recovered.\n\"Hmm.\"\nAt that, the man fiddled with the wine glass and walked towards the phone on his table, and touched it.\nAfter a couple of ringing tones, someone answered and the man spoke with a friendly voice.\n\"Yes. Commissioner Wang. It is me.\"\nVice-chairman's office\nIn the reception room was a cocoon the size of a king-size bed.\nThe demon Deo was recovering inside the white cocoon resembling a caterpillar.\nIn front of it, someone was walking. It was Chun Yeowun.\nChun Yeowun asked Shakena who was following him.\n\"How long is left for him to recover?\"\nAt that, Shakena put her hand on the cocoon and felt the flow of energy as she answered,\n\"Hmm… I think a day or two is left to fully recover.\"\n\"And how much did he recover?\"\n\"The chest area holding the core has recovered and the problem now is stabilizing the demonic powe…\"\nBefore the words were done, Chun Yeowun moved closer.\nSlash! Tear!\nAs the cocoon was torn, the demon Deo curled in a fetal position.\nNaked, he rolled down on the floor with a sticky liquid.\nDeo didn't wake up as if he was dead.\nIn shock, Shakena yelled.\n\"Master! He isn't fully recovered…\"\n\"No need.\"\nChun Yeowun breathed his energy into the center of the demon's chest.\nDeo, who didn't seem like he would wake up, opened his eyes and screamed.\n\"Ack!\"\nGrab!\nChun Yeowun grabbed the neck.\nAs everything was happening too fast, Deo didn't understand what had happened.\n\"W-what? All of a sudden?\"\n\"Your former boss. Where is he now?\"\n\"Boss?\"\n\"The traitor who preyed on his own.\"\n\"… why?\"\nChun Yeowun answered with a cold voice.\n\"I need to get rid of him right now.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 127: Oshin Group (1)\nWithin the Oshin Group.\nA man on the terrace answered the phone with a serious face.\nThe middle-aged man with big ears and thick lips was Mun Il-hyang, the chairman of Oshin Group and the Murim Association.\n\"Yes, Yes… I understand.\"\nLooking at the way he answered the call, it was clear that he was talking to a difficult person.\nAfter hanging up the phone, he took a cigar and lit it.\n\"Phew.\"\nThe smoke filled the face. And then a man with thick lips in his thirties asked the man.\n\"Father. Was it them again?\"\nThe man was Mun Yi-kyung, Mun Il-hyang's first son.\nThis one took the place of Mun Jeong-so, the deputy of the Association who died at the hands of Chun Yeowun.\n\"Yes.\"\nAnswering, he sucked on the cigar once again.\nMun Yi-kyung was frustrated by that.\n\"This is bad. They have lately been acting like our boss, aren't they doing too much?\"\nMun Il-hyang didn’t answer.\nIt meant he didn't want to get into the conversation.\n\"Father. I think we need to move our hands now. We can't always be swayed by them. Think about the future of the Group.\"\n\"Sigh.\"\nMun Il-hyang sighed as he let out the smoke.\nHis son's proposal wasn't an easy thing to do.\nUnfortunately, he was the only one who knew their true selves. This might seem horrible for his son, but he knew that there was no escape from them.\n'Son… that one is the devil.'\nMun Il-hyang sold his soul to the devil. If he didn't do it, the Group wouldn't be where it was, and he wouldn't have been so strong.\n'He and those who follow him are something that humans couldn't tackle.'\nNo one knew how many times he wanted to say it. However, if he said that to the public, things would head differently for him, so he kept silent.\n\"… father, you speak of nothing to me!\"\nMun Yi-kyung kept looking at his father and sighed.\n\"At least what was it in the middle of the night?\"\n\"They asked me to hire people to enter the TRA right now.\"\nAt that, Mun Yi-kyung's face went stiff.\n\"Huh? That restricted area?\"\nThe TRA was the place where even the government gave up and locked it down. Why did they want people going down to such a dangerous place?\nA starless dark night filled with clouds.\nA cold city where not a single light could enter.\nThe name of the city was Fuyang.\nAs one of Anhui's cities, it was once a place with a population of over 3 million, but now the city of death has no survivors.\nMost of the buildings were destroyed, and no place was left intact. More than 80% of the wall has been broken, and Restricted Area signposts have been buried in the grounds.\nThis was one of the reasons why the entry was prohibited.\nWheing!\nIn this place where a gloomy wind blew, green smoke rose like haze.\nIt was a radioactive contamination phenomenon.\nAt first glance, it could have been mistaken to be the outcome of a nuke, but mankind cannot use a nuke at present.\nThis was created by that 'being'.\nShhh!\nA black shadow moved across the city at high speed.\nThe black shadow flying over the dark city stopped at a certain point.\nIt was a ruined area.\n\"Must be here.\"\nThe shadow mumbled as it started over a pit of 120 meters. There was something huge in its middle, but it was unique to see.\n\"He needs to be woken up again.\"\nThe shadow mumbled in a nervous voice and reached out his hand.\nA faint red energy flowed out from the shadow and entered the pit.\nThere was no reaction.\n'Huh?'\nThe eyes looking down the pit were a bit confused. It obviously had to be in this place.\n'No way, they said it died 7 years back… ah!'\nAt that moment, the ground shook as if an earthquake had occurred around the pit.\nThe hardened ground crumbled, sharp things in unique shape began to soar.\nIt seemed like this thing was high enough to be taller than the high-rise buildings.\n'It is up!'\nThe shadow's eyes, which were looking down, smiled.\nOne of the worst beings that was put to sleep was now up.\nAt the same time, in Xian's City State Council, an emergency meeting was held.\nBecause it was late at night, not all the council members were present. Even the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister weren't there, and this meeting was being led by council member Wang Yi-cheng.\nThe agenda for the meeting, which was being held by the heads of four departments and important members of the state council, was truly shocking.\n\"What are you saying now? Are you saying that thing in the TRA has awoken?\"\n\"It was quiet for 7 years. Why now?\"\nThe councils were enraged. They didn't want to believe what they were hearing about this existence within the TRA.\nIn particular, that being in Fuyang city was risky.\nIt destroyed three cities and killed over 5 million people.\n\"No! Wasn't that thing dead?\"\nThe existence which could destroy everything with a single move, it had one day stopped moving.\nIt was seven years since the last time they heard about it, so everyone considered it to be dead.\nHowever, that thing was now awake from its slumber, which was an utter crisis.\nWhen everyone was shocked, Defense Minister Ahn Woo-hong said,\n\"The Prime Minister and deputy aren't here yet, so why not just give out a Code Red and issue evacuation orders for those close to the city and wait for further orders?\"\nThe surrounding places were in danger.\nUnlike other gates, this one could destroy the entire china.\nAnd if they weren't cautious enough, history could repeat itself.\n\"We will keep the army close to Fuyang city.\"\nThe situation was critical, so Ahn Woo-hong was about to step in when Wang Yi-cheng said,\n\"Director Ahn.\"\n\"What? Commissioner Wang! Since we are in tough times, say it quickly.\"\n\"This isn't a matter of military only.\"\n\"?\"\nTo the puzzled Ahn Woo-hong, Wang Y-cheng said.\n\"Didn't the Ministry of National Defense sign an agreement with someone?\"\nOshin Group office.\nAbout 3 hundred employees were gathered. With swords on them, they all seemed to be skilled martial artists.\nCounting the eight strong people that were leading them, this group was the best force.\nThey were called out in the middle of the night by an emergency call for Mun Il-hyang.\nThe people immediately came out with weapons, unable to take their eyes off the TV in the lobby.\n-Breaking News. The state council issued a red alert. Citizens residing within the walls close to Fuyang city, which is a TRA, have been requested to follow the guidelines and head to the other cities.\n\"Oh my…\"\n\"Did it move in the TRA?\"\nThree places were under the TRA.\nAnd there wasn't a single person in the Murim who didn't know of it.\nThe TRA was an unsolved place, be it the military or the Murim, and clearing it was impossible for the humans.\n\"Wait… we aren't heading there, right?\"\n\"We are going to the TRA?\"\nBecause of the news playing at the same time, the people's faces darkened. No matter how strong the Murim people were compared to normal humans. The risks of a Gate appearing were the same.\n'Chairman?'\nThe people looked at Mun Il-hyang who was standing cross-armed in the room.\nFrom his response, they were trying to guess if they had anything to do with the TRA, and it seemed to be true.\nMun Il-hyang's expression was dark.\n'Ugh, did we have to touch the TRA?'\nMun Il-hyang thought to himself.\nOf course, that one said he would intervene later, but it was evident that sacrifices would be made. It would be like burning the house to catch three bugs.\nHe knew about the place.\nThe place to use the TRA to get rid of the Sky Demon Order and recover the image of the Murim Association.\nMaking sacrifices was essential for it.\nIndeed, that one regarded human life like worms.\n'Huh, funny. Since when did I start to care about human life…'\nMun Il-hyang shook his head. He sold his soul to that one for the sake of the success of his Group.\nHuman lives didn't matter to him at that time.\n'Let's just do what we need to and not complicate stuff.'\nMun Il-hyang stopped worrying about it.\nIt was funny.\nHow could other people feel if the so-called great warrior of the Murim, which many Murim people are envious of, was just a minion wielded by the devil?\nAt that time, 12 handsome men and women with exotic appearance appeared in the lobby.\n'They are here.'\nThe demons.\nThe demons who will deal with the one in the TRA.\nAmong the 12 people, two demons stood at the forefront.\n'The three.'\nBeside 'that one', two other demons were here.\nHe wasn't scared of the others, but the three were the scariest ones apart from the one in the top.\n\"Is everything done? Human?\"\nMun Il-yang frowned at the words of the demon called Brom.\nHe was one of the three, with gray-brown hair and a blue suit.\n'This one…'\nThis one demon was the kind who didn't hide his distaste for humans at all.\nAnd Mun Il-hyang was hoping not to run into this one.\n[… it is done. Mr. Brom. You can leave.]\nHe couldn't bow to the demons in front of his staff, so he used telepathy.\n\"It is annoying to do something like this to kill one human.\"\nThe demon didn't like this.\nHe was confident that he could kill the human, but he couldn't understand why such a troublesome plan was made for that.\n\"Don't complain, Brom. There is a saying among humans. Even lions need to do their best to catch rabbits.\"\nAlcado, one of the three, was standing next to him.\nHe had no hair, not even brows as if he had alopecia. And gave out a terrifying impression.\nBrom mumbled at that.\n\"Huh! Humans are just prey. After all, what if I kill him before entering the TRA… huh?\"\nStep!\nA man with sharp eyes, a white face, and a black suit walked into the lobby leisurely.\n\"Uh?\"\nMun Il-hyang unintentionally looked away and was shocked at what he saw. It was Chun Yeowun.\n'No, how did he get here?'\nBecause it was a trap made for this person, who should be on the way to Fuyang city, not this place!\nWhat was even more shocking was.\n'I feel nothing.'\nEven when the man was this close, he couldn't feel anything from the man. He thought there would be no man who reached the Divine Master level.\n'So he is above me?'\nAt that time, Chun Yeowun smiled and said,\n\"Thanks. I was planning on taking care of it all, it seems like all were brought into one place.\"\nAt Chun Yeowun's arrogant remarks, Brom, who was already annoyed, yelled.\n\"Ha! What is with that cheeky bastard? I was getting annoyed so this is a good thing, I'd rather end you here…\"\nShh!\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun appeared right in front of Brom.\nBrom panicked as he was startled by the speed, which made him stretch out his nails that looked like sharp weapons.\n\"You. You seem fine, so I'll start hard.\"\n\"What?\"\nChun Yeowun swung this sword.\nChachachacha!\nAt that moment, a jet black line appeared where the demons were, and including Brom, the trajectory passed countless times.\n'!?'\nIt was shocking.\nAnd the moment the lines were done, all body parts split at the same time for all the 12 demons without a chance to attack.\n'W-what the hell was that?'\nMun Il-hyang was shocked at that.",

Considering the Murim people, they all must be around the Divine Master level. Beside his three henchmen, those three have different skills.]\nDeo tried to dissuade Chun Yeowun.\nHe didn't like it, but since he swore allegiance to the man, he didn't want him to die.\n[Everyone reached Divine Master…]\nAs fighting-type beings from birth, the demons were stronger than humans. Which meant no one could stand against them.\nIn that case, if that man was sending in demons when Chun Yeowun was away, one day he might be late and too many casualties might occur.\nTo prevent that, Chun Yeowun wanted to remove them.\nChachachach!\nTrajectories in black.\nIt was the invisible sword of Sky Demon energy. If there was an absolute way to destroy the opponent, he could always unleash the Supreme Demon Sword.\n'But this much is enough.'\nThe power of the invisible sword with Sky Demon energy is enough.\n\"H-How could a human…\"\nBrom, whose head was split into dozens of pieces, asked.\nIt wasn't just him.\nIn an instant, the entire body of 12 demons was torn apart.\n\"Kuak!\"\n\"Kack!\"\nThe only thing remaining unharmed from the demon's bodies was the core.\nThe demon-like swordsmanship cut down everything apart from that one thing.\nShhh!\nWhen Chun Yeowun reached out his hand, the core was sucked out from the demon's bodies.\n'It would be bad to get rid of these.'\nMystic abilities were inside the demons' cores. And that was the reason why he didn't use the Supreme Sky Demon Sword.\nSince the Supreme Sky Demon Sword would cut off everything, Chun Yeowun tried not to use it.\n\"No way!\"\nMun Il-hyang, who was watching from the sidelines, wasn't shocked.\nEven he, who was at the peak of the current Murim, could barely deal with one demon.\nBesides, two of the three main demons were here.\n'To take down two of the three strong demons like this…'\nIt was truly overwhelming.\nWith that, Mun Il-hyang knew for sure.\n'This man is Heavenly Master level…'\nAt that time, Chun Yeowun swung the sword.\nAnd the invisible sword which emerged in the air, flew through one of the pillars in the lobby.\nPuck!\n\"Kuak!\"\nThe same sound cracks could be heard from other sides too. And suddenly, the space below the lobby shook, and someone appeared.\nIt was Alcado.\n\"Kuaa…\"\nAlcado grabbed his stomach, and black smoke was coming out.\nIt was a wound made by the invisible sword.\nIn addition, the face and body were full of cuts.\n\"How did you avoid it?\"\nChun Yeowun asked curiously.\nThe invisible sword with Sky Demon energy on it definitely aimed for them all.\nBut in that brief moment, one escaped.\nAlcado stared at Chun Yeowun.\n'That one is a monster!'\nOne of his abilities was teleportation. He could use it within a distance of 15 meters.\n'I thought I managed to avoid…'\nHe used it the moment Chun Yeowun appeared in front of Brom.\nIf he hadn't instinctively felt the crisis and did that, he would have been cut into pieces of meat like them.\nHe always thought that his teleportation wasn't that good since it was short-range, but now it saved his life.\n'He isn't someone I can deal with by myself.'\n\"What the hell are you doing? Attack him!\"\nAlcado hurriedly shouted at Mun Il-hyang and the other warriors.\nThe elders and the others, who were watching it in admiration, came to their senses, but they didn't act on it.\nIt was strange for them to act after seeing what they did.\n'What should I do?'\n'How can that monster be stopped?'\nSeeing their attitude, Alcado bit his lip. Maybe the humans were too scared to move.\nHis clan members felt fear as well, but their master or leader ordered it.\n'But the humans… huh?'\nWong!\nAlcado tried to hurriedly teleport because of the invisible sword flying towards him. And his body appeared at the entrance of the gate, which was 15 meters away.\n'Damned bastard!'\nA little late, and the sword would've been pierced in him. While he was annoyed and worried, Chun Yeowun appeared ahead of him.\nShh!\n\"You. Do you call that fast movement?\"\n\"Huk?\"\nChun Yeowun tried to touch him again with the sword.\nConfused, Alcado teleported again.\nWooong!\nThis time, it was outside the building. It would be nice to teleport in a cool way, but he had no choice.\n'I need to run away.'\nThis wasn't someone he could deal with.\nSo he thought that if he teleported constantly, he could escape.\nWoong!\nAlcado teleported.\nAnd once again, his body appeared 15 meters away.\nAnd he was about to teleport again, until he saw something.\nCrackle!\nLightning sparks flowed right ahead of him. And not just one. Uncountable swords with Thunder qi were spread out around him.\n\"W-what…\"\nShh.\nRight ahead, stood Chun Yeowun once again.\nAlthough he was unable to teleport, he couldn't believe Chun Yeowun's fast movement.\n\"You can only move around 5 jang?\"\nThe distance of jang was the traditional unit, which meant 15 meters.\nAlcado's face went stiff.\n'When did he notice it?'\nUnfortunately, and despite not using it a lot, Chun Yeowun understood the ability. If this man couldn't travel too far, then the solution was simple.\nIt was to make a ranged attack ready in any direction he might take.\nWith a smile, Chun Yeowun said.\n\"Try it again. That ability to move.\"\n\"… You, are you really a human?\"\n\"I am tired of hearing the same question each time.\"\nShh!\nWhen Chun Yeowun lifted his finger, the countless swords surrounding Alcado rushed for him.\nCrackle!\n'What fucked up mess is this!'\nAcaldo's face turned pale at the lightning coming for him.\nMeanwhile, in the sky, not far from Gwangju city.\nThere were two flying figures which were moving across the sky.\nAs they flew at the same high speed, the faces were disrupted.\nShhh!\nWhen one stopped, the other stopped too.\nAnd the exotic-looking man in a grey jumper asked.\n\"My King. Why did you st…\"\n\"The link with the clan was cut off.\"\n\"Huh? What is that supposed to mean?\"\nAt the bewildered question, the man whose face was in shadow, yelled out.\n\"It means that all those gathered in the Ohsin Group were killed.\"\n\"H-How?\"\nThe clan was their strength.\nAnd the clan members sent there were strong ones who were awakened, and such ones were annihilated?\n\"There were two of the top three there. No way, are they…\"\n\"They were hit.\"\n\"No.\"\nThe three people had served this person since the past. They were the ones who turned strong as they ate the pursuers of the clan.\nIt was hard to believe that they were defeated.\n\"No… did a Duke come?\"\n\"Duke?\"\nOtherwise, these clan members couldn't be defeated.\n\"Did the Dukes move?\"\nThe man stroked his chin with a serious look. If the Duke's pursuers came, then the situation was dire.\n\"If even one of the Dukes was sent or came here, then returning to Gwangju will only disrupt the entire thing the King established.\"\nAt the subordinates' words, the man fell into anguish. At that moment, the phone on his wrist rang.\nRing!\nHe looked at the screen.\n[Oshin Group chairman, Mun Il-hyang.]\nHis eyes gleamed in suspicion.\nThe entire clan was annihilated, and it was strange that this man only called now.\nHesitating, he answered it.\n\"Mun Il-hyang?\"\n-It must be you.\nThe man's eyes narrowed. This wasn't Mun Il-hyang's voice.\n\"Who are you?\"\n-Me? I am the Chun Ma of the Great Sky Demon Order.\nChun Yeowun.\nWhen he boldly gave out his identity, the man's face distorted.\nHe thought that this was done by the pursuers of the clan, but this was done by the person they were trying to trap and kill.\nIt was absurd, so he said.\n\"You… did that? Chun Mu-seong?\"\n-Well… I didn't mean to, but I did what you did to me.\n\"What?\"\n-I was going to wipe out all of you, not just that one place.\nCrack!\nThe man clenched the phone, it was fortunate that the phone was made of gold and didn't break right away.\n\"You are cheeky. How dare you say that to me?\"\n-You have been too immersed in human society for too long, but it doesn't seem like you can fully act like a human.\nAt Chun Yeowun's words, the man went silent.\nAccording to what he had just heard, this man knew about his identity. Which meant there was no need to act.\n\"You know about us.\"\n-A traitor who preys on his own people.\nAt Chun Yeowun's sarcastic words, the man spoke in a voice filled with anger.\n\"That isn't something I want to hear from inferior humans.\"\n-You are a funny one. If you think humans are inferior, come to the Oshin group.\n\"What?\"\n-Don't make me wait for long. Don't tell me you are trying to run away with your tail between your legs?\n\"You cheeky worm!\"\nAt Chun Yeowun's words, the man's face turned red. Suddenly, his eyes turned black. He wanted to kill this man on the phone right away.\n\"My King.\"\nThe subordinate, who was listening to the call, shook his head after pressing the silence button so the other side couldn't hear it.\n\"It's a trap. Calm down.\"\n\"…\"\nThe energy he was releasing subsided and the man was back to normal.\n'I am glad I have this one.'\nHe lost all his power and two of his best subordinates, and he was on the verge of losing his control…\n'Luther is right. Having dealt with all of them meant he came well prepared over there. So I must not fall for his trap.'\nHe wanted to go, but he wasn't sure what the enemy was wanting him to do. And Luther spoke in a hushed voice.\n\"He is going to come to the TRA area. We can use that as our stage.\"\nThe man nodded and released the silence button and said.\n\"Do you think I will do what you want me to?\"\n-Running away?\n\"Running? Ha! Do you think I will be afraid of a human who is nothing more than a bug? If you want to die so much, come to Fuyang. I will take your life over there.\"\n-Fuyang?\nAs Luther said, he brought Chun Yeowun to the place he wanted.\nIf Chun Yeowun came there, he could trap him.\n-Such an obvious plan.\n\"If you don't come, I will do the same to you. Doesn't your presence there mean that Yongchun is empty?\"\nThis time, he provoked Chun Yeowun and thought it would work.\n-You are pretty close.\n\"What?\"\nThe man frowned at those words. He wondered what it meant.\nPuck!\n\"Kuak!\"\nA scream erupted from Luther's mouth and a hand protruded from his chest.\nAnd in the hand was Luther's core.\n'!?'\nWhen the man looked at the one behind Luther, he couldn't hide his shock.\nIt was Chun Yeowun.\n\"H-How are you here?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 129: Oshin Group (3)\nThe man who was always in the shadows was Hagar. The clan's traitor.\n'Where in hell did he come from?'\nHagar's eyes shone.\nEven when he gained strength, since he was a fugitive and always on the run, he was extremely vigilant.\nSo since this man came from the office side, he should have known.\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun smiled.\n'It was worth it.'\nHe decided not to let Hagar notice him.\nIt was around 2:00 in the morning.\nMoving in the shadow realm, Chun Yeowun moved closer, where the other two immediately used the teleportation ability to narrow the distance.\nA useful ability he managed to get.\n\"Kua… you…!\"\nLuther, whose chest was pierced, was furious. But what could he do? His core was already in Chun Yeowun's hand.\n\"Are you the last of the three?\"\nPak!\nWithout hesitation, Chun Yeowun pulled it out.\n\"Noooo!\"\nHagar tried to reach before his friend's core got pulled out, but he was too late.\nWhen the core left the body, Luther fell to the ground.\nSwosh! Thud!\nBlack smoke began to rise around the body which fell.\nIf the core wasn't put in right away, he would die immediately.\n\"You bug!\"\nHagar's eyes got dyed in black and black veins grew all over his body.\nBut the appearance was unusual.\n'What is that?'\nAll the exposed areas were covered in scars. Most of them were sword cuts.\n'Sword?'\nAt first glance, it looked like sword wounds. However, these weren't, it seemed like numerous ones.\n'What?'\nThey seemed to be wounds from several kinds of weapons.\nHe was puzzled, but Hagar, who was standing there enraged, yelled,\n\"if you don't give me that, I will kill you!\"\nHe pointed to the core in Chun Yeowun's hand.\n\"Do you need this?\"\n\"Careful. Human! If it takes even the slightest damage, you will die…\"\nBefore he could even finish, Chun Yeowun opened the shadow in his palm and put the core in it.\nShhh!\n'!?'\nSeeing that, Hagar's expression hardened.\n\"No… that ability?\"\nIf he wasn't mistaken, the ability he witnessed belonged to Kyle.\nAs he had no reason to hide anything, Chun Yeowun said,\n\"Ah, thanks it was useful.\"\n\"What?\"\nHagar couldn't understand it.\nIf what he heard was true, then that meant Chun Yeowun took Kyle's ability.\nBut that was impossible!\n'A human has the powers of demons? No way.'\nHe himself had done too many experiments since he came here. In addition to preying on his own kind, he tried to transfer abilities to people.\nHowever, not a single human could possess a demon's power. It was impossible and he was sure of it.\n'No. rather than that, I need to take that core from him.'\nHe didn't have the time to fall into thinking. He should reclaim the core before it was too late.\n\"Don't make me do something which will make you regret your actions.\"\nPhat!\nHagar flew towards Chun Yeowun as he reached out a sword with flames in his hand.\nWheik!\nHagar, who was pushed back, took a unique pose, and then he unfolded a technique.\n'Sword technique?'\nWickedly clean! The sword of flames in Hagar's hands aimed at Chun Yeowun's body like a vicious beast.\n\"I'll cut off your limbs with the martial arts you are so proud of!\"\nThe trajectory drawn by the sword of flame went for Chun Yeowun. However, in an instant, he disappeared and appeared behind him.\n\"This?\"\nHagar couldn't hide his shock.\nThis was Alcado's teleportation.\n'How did this happen?'\nThere was no room for shock.\nChun Yeowun drew his sword.\nAnd at that moment, the demon felt a chill run down his spine.\nSwish!\nNot thinking, Hagar leaned back, and a black line passed through.\n'Invisible Sword? No, this is different.'\nHagar, who had mastered martial arts, was aware of the systems within it. However, this was different from the normal invisible sword.\nFrom that black line, he could feel a ferocious yet thick darkness, and if he hadn't moved, he would have definitely lost his life.\n\"I thought you wouldn't avoid it, well, you are the leader.\"\nHagar's face contorted at Chun Yeowun's words. He couldn't tell if this was a joke or a compliment.\nIt was unbearable to hear such things coming out of a human's mouth.\nHagar stretched out his hand.\nWoong! Woong! Woong!\nHundreds of spheres with demonic power appeared all around the space.\nWhen Hagar grabbed the sword, the spheres turned into sword shapes and surrounded Chun Yeowun within 100 meters.\n\"How do you plan on dodging that?\"\n\"Ho.\"\n\"Surprised? Did you humans consider that using swords freely without holding them was Air Swords? Unlike you humans, the demons with higher psyche like mine can handle as many as I want at the same time.\"\nHagar yelled in a happy voice. And as he said that, the demonic spheres moved as if they were alive.\nSwoos!\nHundreds of them rushed at the same time.\n'This is fun.'\nChun Yeowun smiled.\nOther than Chun Yeowun himself, Hagar was the first demon to have this idea.\n\"But you're facing the wrong opponent.\"\n\"What?\"\nChun Yeowun stretched out his hand and then pretended to hold it down.\nSwosh!\nDazzling blue light rays fell from a higher sky and stopped the demonic swords.\nPang! Pang!\nThe swords which collided exploded. Hagar was taken aback at the swords which came in from above.\n\"W-what is this?\"\nIt was one of Chun Yeowun's favourites, Sky Flash.\nAll the swords were accurately stopped with the help of Nano's panel system.\n'No way! How can a human being…?'\nFrom what he knew, humans could never have such strength.\nEven if they have attained enlightenment, they have a limit because of their narrow thoughts.\nBut seeing this human control so many swords, he was speechless.\n'Is he really human?'\nLike all others, he had the same thoughts. But there was a difference, this demon wasn't going to give up.\nCrack!\nHe looked at the sky. And then the black eyes turned grey.\nThe night sky above began to change as clouds began to come.\nChun Yeowun narrowed his eyes.\n\"Clouds?\"\nRumble! Rumble!\nDark clouds were coming above them as if an extreme weather phenomenon was happening.\nThunder clouds were appearing.\n\"I will kill you!\"\nRumble!\nAs he finished speaking, blue lightning strikes could be seen on the black clouds, and they all went for Chun Yeowun.\nThe lightning seemed too powerful and destructive.\nCrackle!\n\"Human! Die!\"\nThe lightning devoured the Sky Flash and struck Chun Yeowun.\nIt was strong enough to destroy the entire area.\nAmong all the Count level hearts that Hagar had eaten, this was the best ability he got.\n'This is the price a human has to pay for provoking me.'\nEven an S-class Alpha entity could be killed at once, which meant this couldn't be stopped.\nHowever,\n'!?'\nAn unbelievable thing occurred right ahead of him.\nChun Yeowun, who had to be dead, was standing completely fine.\n\"H… how?\"\nHe had no way of knowing that Chun Yeowun, who became immune to lightning after absorbing the core of the Dragon Turtle, wouldn't be affected by this.\n\"How disappointing.\"\nAt that time, Chun Yeowun raised his hand and swung it like a circle, and the lightning followed his movement.\nCrackle!\nThe huge lightning started to move in his hands.\n\"No… way?\"\n\"Let's hit you this time.\"\nWhen Chun Yeowun reached out to Hagar, the lightning went there.\nHagar tried to avoid it, but since it was too huge,\nCrackle!\n\"This is insane!\"\nKwang!\n\"Kuak!\"\nHagar, who was struck, fell to the ground as he screamed.\nUnfortunately, he didn't have any core or blood of a spirit beast inside him, so he received the shock.\nKwang!\n\"Kuak… cough…\"\nBlack smoke came out of his stomach as he was dug in a 100-meter pit.\nIf he hadn't changed into an awakened body, he might have completely disappeared.\nHagar stood up as he staggered and involuntarily clasped his hands.\n\"Kuak… among the trashy humans…. are monsters like this…\"\nTrickle!\nHe recalled what happened six years ago, and felt the wounds on his body hurt again.\nSince that day, he had been avoiding direct fights and began to build his power, but he never dreamt that he would once again be in the same situation.\nStep!\nChun Yeowun descended in front of him.\n\"Now let me take your core as well.\"\nHagar's face flushed red at the words and laughed.\n\"Kuahahaha!\"\n\"Have you gone crazy because of your own helplessness?\"\nGrunt!\nAfter laughing, Hagar grunted his teeth.\n\"You asshole! Fine! I couldn't control my power since I was in this form, and so I endured it, but I don't need to do it anymore. I will show you my true power, you human!\"\nThuk!\nHagar's veins, which were bulged, sank.\nHis entire body swelled up and scales began to sprout out like armour.\nEven horns were coming up from his head.\nWoong!\nHis power rose explosively, and the surroundings trembled.\nIn the midst of the change, Hagar said, revealing his sharp teeth which were black.\n\"Kuak! rejoice. For the first time, you will have the honor of seeing a member higher than Duke or…\"\nSlash!\n'!?'\nAt that moment, Hagar's vision turned downward and he fell.\n'T-this…'\nAll he saw was the ground where he fell.\nHis head was cut off.\n\"Kua… y, you…\"\nChun Yeowun's voice could be heard.\n\"Idiot. Did you think I would wait until your transformation was complete?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 130: TRA (1)\nIt was only a year ago did Hagar make some progress.\nThere was a limit to becoming stronger by preying on his own kind, so he concentrated on controlling his demonic powers.\nAnd when he became able to control it, he thought he moved to a new level of advancement.\nHowever, as he progressed, he discovered a major drawback.\nThe power was so explosively increased that the Nation Defense Agency had managed to capture it on their radar. After that, he never used it again.\nThe first time he decided to use it was against a strong enemy and the result was…\nRoll roll!\n\"Kuak!\"\nHis neck was cut off, and his head was rolling on the ground.\nWho would have imagined that the man would decide to attack him at the moment he was awakening?\n'You.. you coward!'\nFor Hagar, this was flustering.\nThe most absurd thing was that during the process of awakening, the body turns indestructible.\nHowever, that body was cut off.\n'I need to restore the body.'\nFortunately, he had self-healing abilities that could help him out. As long as the core wasn't lost, any damage could be repaired.\n'No? why isn't it healing?'\nHagar couldn't hide his shock.\nAlthough the wound on the neck was severe, he was sure it could heal.\nBut it didn't.\n'Isn't this the same as then?'\nThis was the second time the wound didn't heal.\nIf there was a difference, it healed in the past after some time, but there was no sign of that now.\nThe ferocious destructive dark energy was blocking it.\n'What the…'\nTak!\nChun Yeowun pulled the demon's head.\nGrab!\n\"Still alive? Amazing.\"\nEven though the head was severed, it was spinning and the demon seemed alive.\n\"Is this the effect of awakening?\"\nIt sounded cold and Hagar thought it was sarcastic.\nGritting his teeth, he opened his mouth.\n\"You bastard! What did you do? Why is my body…\"\nBefore even letting him finish, Chun Yeowun asked,\n\"What did you mean earlier when you said other monsters like me?\"\nHagar's eyes fluttered.\nHe didn't think this man would take his words seriously.\n\"A human?\"\nAs Chun Yeowun personally fought with the current Murims, he knew that there was no one who could win against Hagar.\nIt was no exaggeration to say that even the Five Great Warriors would lose against Hagar.\n\"Was that the one who left the scars on your body?\"\nCreepy.\nAt the mention of the scars, Hagar felt anxious.\nDemons cannot leave scars.\nHowever, it was strange that the wounds inflicted by that person didn't heal.\n'Damn it!'\nHe still couldn't forget that day.\nIt was raining that night.\nThe indifferent red eyes which looked down on his bleeding body.\n[Why?]\nWithout answering, the monster aimed to kill him.\nAt that time, Kyle appeared and dragged him into the shadow realm.\nIf not for that, he would have been long dead.\nKyle was seriously injured and the scars on his face were also made by that person.\n'That can't happen now.'\nBecause he had no more subordinates around, Hagar opened his mouth while glaring at Chun Yeowun.\n\"Huh! As if I would tell…. Ah!\"\nBut suddenly, something popped into his head.\nHe wondered what if the monstrous humans collided? Hagar became curious about the martial arts because of that person.\n'A monster versus monster…'\nIt was an interesting plot.\nHe even wanted to see it, but might not have the chance.\nIt was definite that he would die.\n\"Do you know a place called Mount Bigol?\"\n\"Mount Bigol?\"\nChun Yeowun narrowed his eyes, he definitely heard of it.\n'When? Ah!'\nMount Bigol, on the Sichuan province border.\nFamous for its steepness, there was a place on the cliff. The one called Death valley because it was so deep and the torrents from the upstream were so strong that no one could survive it.\nThe reason Chun Yeowun remembered it was…\n[Unfortunately, the civil war within the Forces of Evil is likely to end with the victory of Hang-yeon. Lord.]\n[Is that so?]\nDuring that time.\nPrecisely before heading to the North Sea Ice Palace.\nThe Forces of Evil were having a civil war and he heard from Elder Huan that due to the sudden appearance of the great Forces of Evil's Hang-yeon, one of the Five Great Warrior at that time and leader of the Forces of Evil, the situation was known to be troubling.\n[Didn't we think that the Forces of Evil were at a disadvantage?]\n[We did, but information came out that the one leading the other side of the fight fell into Death Valley and died. I wondered if Hang-yeon's era would pass, but it didn't seem like it would happen. Huhuhu.]\nAt that time, he heard about this place. And this thing had happened around a thousand years ago.\nHagar continued.\n\"If you want to meet that monster, go there.\"\nHe didn't say anything else.\nIt was because the man could think he was deceiving him, if not, one day they would definitely cross their paths.\n\"Kill me. Now.\"\nAs he was done, he wanted to self-destruct. But with the head being cut off and the sensations in his body gone, it was impossible.\nChun Yeowun spoke to Hagar who gave up.\n\"Just one more question. What were you guys up to?\"\nThe reason they put themselves in the Murim Association was heard from Deo.\nIt was to monitor the pursuers coming to them, observe the Gates and increase their power.\nDeo said that the man wanted to become the king and return back to his world. But he couldn't figure out why he still stayed here.\nSo there must have been another reason.\n\"Huh! Did you think I would say that to someone like you? Don't waste your time and kill me!\"\nOf course, he wouldn't answer such a question. Chun Yeowun shook his head.\n\"Well, it doesn't matter. I heard that you are the last.\"\nWhatever their intention was, Hagar was their head and the others were already dead. If he was killed, everything would be back to normal.\n'Such a pity.'\nIf only the Ghost qi worked, his last question would have been solved, but it didn't work on demons.\nChun Yeowun approached Hagar's body which was on the ground.\nAnd then used the sword.\nChachach!\nA sharp black sword cut the center of the chest into a circle.\nAfter doing that, Chun Yeowun sucked the core from it.\nAnd Hagar watched it with trembling eyes.\n'No way! Does it end like this…'\nA baron with the dream to become a King. He thought of becoming the King of Demons!\nOnly if he could have 'that'!!\nBut everything was ending like this.\n'That when I just found a clue to it.'\nSadly, it was too late.\nOnce the core breaks, he will be done.\nAt the moment when he was in despair.\n'!?'\nChun Yeowun, who knew how to destroy it, put it on the black wrist guard.\nWoong!\nThe guard resonated, and the core was taken in.\nConfused, Hagar asked.\n\"You, how did you do it?\"\n\"What?\"\nChun Yeowun looked at him.\nOsss!\nAs the core was absorbed, Hagar's body cracked and with black smoke, he soon turned into ashes.\n'What?'\nChun Yeowun frowned.\nThe way Hagar asked, it was as if he was shocked by it.\n\"Sky Demon Sword?\"\nHagar definitely looked at the sword which was in wrist guard form.\n'Why was he shocked with the sword?'\nHe couldn't understand it.\nShhh!\nMeanwhile, information about Hagar's abilities flooded into Chun Yeowun's head.\nXian, the capital of the government.\nThe West Public Security Bureau wasn't too far from the train station.\nAs it was a place for the government, there were four Public Security Bureaus in Xian, and the general Public Security office was within the State Council.\nOne of them, the West Public Security Bureau's special department building.\nIn the hallway, a sad-looking middle-aged man in the chief's uniform was personally guiding someone.\nThe director of Public Security was Ahn Jung-yun.\n\"Secretary general, this side.\"\nAnd the man in his forties with a beard and glasses, who was being guided, was Wei Hae-sang, the secretary general of the National Defense Agency.\nHe was like the third head of the National Demon Agency.\n\"Is it running rampant?\"\n\"Fortunately, docile.\"\nAt that, Wei Hae-sang nodded his head and they eventually received the special task force building.\nChak!\nAt the appearance of the director and a guest of the National Defense Agency, the members of the special task force got up and saluted them.\n\"Enough. Everyone back to work! Manager Kang.\"\n\"Yes. Director?\"\n\"Where is it?\"\nIn response to Ahn Jung-yun's question, the man led them to the interrogation room.\nThe 5th interrogation room.\nIt was a room for Murims and people with abilities.\n\"In here?\"\n\"Yes. Meal time.\"\n\"This time?\"\n\"He kept saying that he was hungry, so we ordered a late-night snack.\"\nDirector Ahn Jung-yun clicked his tongue at Manager Kang's words, and said to the secretary general.\n\"Let's head into the observational room.\"\nEach interrogation room had an observation room right next to it. It was a place where one could see what was happening.\nAs they entered, Wei Hae-sang's eyes lit up.\n\"What is all this?\"\nNumerous weapons were placed on the table in the observation room.\nIt seemed like 30 at first glance.\nStarting with swords, blades, spears, knuckles and more unique stuff which could only be seen in movies, but next to the table was a box.\n\"Huh.\"\nManager Kang explained.\n\"They all belonged to him.\"\nThrough the glass, he pointed to the man in his early thirties, who was wearing shaggy clothes and eating with his hands. He ate like a possessed beggar.\n\"Is this the one who made a GateKeepers leader that way?\"\n\"Not just that one. Also the Lee Cha-jun of the special department who went in to get him.\"\nSpecial task force department.\nThere were 7 Murim warriors of which the Public Security was proud.\nOne of them was Lee cha-jun, a Superior Master. He was now in the emergency room.\nChief Kang could still remember that scene.\n\"… such a monstrous person. With just a few snaps of his fingers, he defeated him.\"\n\"Snaps of fingers?\"\nAt that, the secretary general was shocked.\nHe knew about Lee cha-jun, the man in top 30 warriors. It was hard to believe that such a person was sent to the emergency room in a couple snaps.\n\"A registered person?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Not even the identity?\"\n\"We were told that he had been living with his grandfather in deep mountains since he was a child, but no means to check if it was the truth or not.\"\nAt that, Wei Hae-sang was confused.\n\"Does it make sense for such a skilled warrior to reach that level in the mountains? Where the hell did he come from?\"\n\"It is a name I heard for the first time…\"\n\"What is that place?\"\n\"Death Valley.\"\n\"Death valley?\"\nJust the name gave them creeps.\nHowever, they had no way of knowing that name.\n\"Ha! Insane! No name! No identity! He just comes and spouts that… and what the hell is that place?\"\nChief Kang scratched his head as Wei Hae-sang said that and added,\n\"Uh…it made me laugh after hearing about it, but he said that he came down to become the best in Murim.\"\n\"What? Best in Murim?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 131: TRA (2)\nWei Hae-sang frowned at what he heard.\nIt was understandable that Manager Kang was laughing.\n'To become the best in Murim… he came down the mountain? Ha!'\nHe was speechless.\nAs a result of this man's actions, most of the special ability people in the Western Public Security Bureau were taken to the emergency room, and he wants to be the best in Murim?\n'Because of the warning order in the TRA region, I am already on the edge.'\nThe city was in a state of chaos.\nDue to the state of emergency that was issued, the State Council had decided to call the available reserve forces of each agency and provide support.\nThe western area was included in it, and this was the fourth time.\n\"What is his name?\"\n\"He said it was Sayogi.\"\n\"Sayogi?\"\nIt was an odd name, but the attitude and the face seemed to go well with the unique name.\nThe man called Sayogi, who was eating the delicious pork legs, raised his head and looked out the window.\nIt was as if he was looking through it.\n\"They can't see from that side, right?\"\n\"Yes. But it doesn't seem like the interrogation room's glass would work on him.\"\n\"Now what shit is that?\"\n\"When someone comes into the observation room, he acts up and guesses it. Besides, he seems to know if the person entering is a new one or not.\"\n\"Huh.\"\nThe more one knew about him, the more terrifying the man would seem.\nHe was put in the special room made for people with abilities, yet that didn't work on him.\nDoes this mean that this man could actually escape any time he wanted to?\n\"How is such a person being submissive?\"\nAt that time, director Ahn Jung-yun answered.\n\"He asked for a permit for weapons.\"\nThe first time Sayogi was exposed was at the underground high-speed station in Xian. Over there, he was caught trying to pass through the checkpoint without an ID and weapons permit.\nNaturally, the officers wanted to confiscate the weapons, but it ended up backfiring.\n\"Hmm.\"\nWei Hae-sang looked at the man called Sayogi. He couldn't understand what this man was thinking.\nHe looked at the other two and said.\n\"I will head into the interrogation room.\"\n\"Huh? Secretary general will? Sir, it could be dangerous. No, sir, you could be seriously hurt, the man there…\"\n\"No. enough. According to what you said, if he wanted to, he could have done a lot of things already.\"\n\"That is true, but.\"\nAlthough they tried to stop him, the man seemed adamant on going in.\nFrom the weapons on the table, Wei Hae-sang took a sword.\n'Heavy.'\nThe sword alone was quite heavy, and the man carried so many things with him? That meant he should be a lot stronger.\nClick!\nWhen he entered the interrogation room, Sayogi looked at him as he was eating.\nAnd then looked at the sword.\n\"I was promised that it wouldn't be touched.\"\nIt seemed more like a warning than a question.\n\"Rather than that, you have a lot of weapons, are you carrying them because you can use them all?\"\nSayogi didn't eat anymore and reached out.\nShh!\n\"Ah?\"\nAt that time, both the sword and the sheath were pulled towards him at the same time, like a fish caught in the bait.\nIt looked like the sword was made to fly.\nIf any Murim warriors saw it, they would have been shocked.\nShh!\nAs it flew, the sword rushed for its sheath at the same time.\n\"Huk!\"\nWei Hae-sang closed his eyes.\nChak!\nAs the sword entered the sheath precisely, he was quite surprised that he went stiff.\nSayogi put the food back in his mouth and said,\n\"Managing hand to hand combat is the basis of White Martial Blade.\"\n\"Hand to hand? White martial?\"\nWei Hae-sang didn't know what it meant, but he knew one thing for sure.\n'He is a strong warrior.'\nWhen he experienced it right in front of his eyes, he was definite.\nAnd he opened his mouth.\n\"Do you know who I am?\"\n\"Nope. But you're called the Secretary general. What is a secretary general and why would I know you? I don't know because my grandfather didn't teach me that.\"\nWei Hae-sang's eyes went wide.\n'Did he hear our conversation in the observation room?'\nThe next room was soundproofed, so no one could listen to what was happening inside.\n'But he talks as…'\nSomething was strange. This man seemed to be using an old-fashioned drama's martial warriors technique.\nThe fact that this man was with his grandfather till now meant there was credibility in what was being said.\n'He learnt everything from his grandfather?'\nIf it was just the two of them, then why did his grandfather teach this man to listen to other people's conversations?\n\"Hm. I am the one authorized to give you a weapons license.\"\n\"… really?\"\nAt that, Sayogi stopped eating and showed interest. The man seemed quite honest about his feelings.\nHe knew how valuable getting the license was to stop being pulled out for handling weapons.\n\"Give me! My grandfather told me to be sure to repay what was done, and be self-employed! I will repay you for the favor.\"\nSayogi smiled and held out his hand.\nLooking at the way he talked, the man seemed na?ve, like a man who didn't know that his hands were cruel.\n\"Are you aware of the term equivalent exchange?\"\n\"Equivalent Exchange?\"\n\"If you want something, you need to pay a price for it.\"\n\"Didn't I say I would return the favor?\"\n\"Before that, you even carried weapons illegally and harmed government officials. Actually, you should be put in jail.\"\nSayogi answered as he didn't understand what was being said.\n\"Government? You mean officials? But aren't officials and Murims inviolable? That is what I have learned from my grandfather.\"\n\"How long have you been in the mountains?\"\n\"Uhh… I was taken to Death Valley by grandfather when I was around 7 years old. It has to be around 90 years back.\"\n\"What?\"\nWei Hae-sang was confused.\nNo matter how much he looked, this man seemed to be in his early thirties, did it make sense that he's been in the mountains for 90 years?\n\"Why are you making that face? Don't you believe me?\"\nHe asked.\n\"I did hear about the most talented warriors in Murim having their bodies transformed to younger selves and living a long life, but would anyone believe that you are close to 100 if your face is like that?\"\n\"Ehhh! What is so special about this? You see, my grandfather has thousand…\"\nSayogi, who was trying to say something by waving his hand, went silent.\n\"Thousand?\"\n\"Nothing! Anyway, I learned from grandfather that the officials and Murims are inviolable, isn't that right?\"\nWei Hae-sang's head throbbed. He didn't know from where to begin. This man knew nothing about the current world, as if he existed in a different time.\nIn the end, Sayogi was informed about everything that had happened and about the Murim coming under the control of the government due to the First Dimension Gate incident.\nSayogi, who listened to it as if listening to a story, shook his head and mumbled.\n\"Oh my, I guess even my grandfather didn't know a lot about the world. There is not a single true thing from everything he told me.\"\nIt seemed like his grandfather was away from society for a long time as well.\nSayogi asked,\n\"Anyway, do you mean that I need to register as a Murm before I work as one?\"\n\"Now we seem to be understanding each other.\"\nWei Hae-sang liked this man who was finally understanding him.\n'Such an innocent one.'\nAnd there was just one thing left to do.\n\"Well, even if you don't register as a Murim, you will be able to possess a weapon if you become a Gate Keeper. Fame will be yours as well.\"\n\"Oh. Was there such a way?\"\n\"Yes. Because I am in a high position in the defense department and the one responsible for the Gate Keepers.\"\nWei Hae-sang was trying to get the man to become a Gate Keeper.\nHowever, it didn't work out.\n\"But I apologize. I would rather register as a Murim.\"\nNo matter what was said, this man remained the same.\n\"Didn't you say you would repay the favor?\"\n\"How can a person who wants to be the best in Murim take a different path? Please understand me taking the way of the warrior.\"\n'Crazy.'\nHe thought that Sayogi was na?ve and that he could manipulate him, but it didn't work out.\n'Okay, then let's change the way.'\n\"Then don't do this. The people you sent to the emergency room were the ones who were called for emergency during the TRA crisis. You made them like that because of an accident, so you will attend the emergency call as a Gate Keeper just this one time, we will give you an ID and a weapons permit. How is it?\"\n\"Uhm.\"\nWei Hae-sang wanted this man to see what he wanted him to be. And Sayogi seemed to think about the proposal.\nHowever, it wasn't easy to confirm if the man was going to agree or not.\n'I was mistaken. I thought he didn't know about the world and was an idiot.'\nWei Hae-sang clicked his tongue. According to the man, he was 100 years old, which meant he wasn't too stupid.\n\"You. Didn't you say you wanted to be the best in Murim? Then, shouldn't you build a reputation?\"\n\"… right.\"\n\"If you play a role in TRA, your name as a Murim warrior will be widely known.\"\n\"Hmmm.\"\n\"Did you know that famous Murim people are participating in the TRA this time?\"\n\"Famous Murim?\"\nFinally, Sayogi seemed to be fully interested.\n\"Famous… you mean the strongest ones?\"\nSayogi had the dream of being the best in Murim, so it was natural for him to show interest in this.\n\"Yes. Chun Mu-seong, who is the hottest topic these days, some of the Five Great Warriors, and other strong people are participating.\"\n\"Strong people of Murim?\"\n\"The greatest of the Murim people.\"\n\"Oh oh! Is that true?\"\nFor Sayogi, taking down on Five Great Warriors was his way to become the best.\n\"Okay. Then I accept the proposal.\"\nWithout hesitation, Sayogi accepted the offer. In a way, it was like meeting each other's needs.\nWei Hei-sang thought he should make good use of this chance and raise the status of Gate Keepers through this when Sayogi asked.\n\"But, is the one called Chun Mu-seong stronger than the Five Great Warriors?\"\nA high-rise office with a good night view in Gwangju. The luxuriously decorated office was where the dead Hagar stayed.\nChun Yeowun reached there under the guidance of Mun Il-hyang, the current head of the Ohsin group and was looking through the belongings.\nMun Il-hyang looked at him and thought.\n'How did it end up like this?'\nMun Il-hyang's face looked like it aged 10 years over the last hours.\nIt was because his Dantian was destroyed by Chun Yeowun in return for keeping his life.\nIt would have been better if that was all.\nTrickle!\nThe slashed part of his right arm was painful. Taking the arm of a swordsman had a significant mental effect. But he didn't complain.\n[Is there any reason to keep you, a minion working for those demons, alive?]\nHis weakness was figured out.\nIf it was known to the world that the chairman of the Murim Association was a slave working for the existences beyond the Gate, his family would be over.\n'That devil!'\nAs if the arm wasn't enough, Chun Yeowun took a lot more.\nHe took the personal slush funds that Mun Il-hyang collected and the stocks of the Ohsin group that he owned. Besides, he ordered to move the main office to another region, pledge allegiance and join the Sky Demon Order.\nOnly after agreeing to all that did he assure his survival.\n'I should have fought till the end or killed myself.'\nHe regretted it, but he could do nothing now. He didn't have the confidence to win against this monster who destroyed the other beings as if they were nothing.\nDespite being in a miserable situation, he managed to survive.\n\"Hmm.\"\nChun Yeowun searched Hagar's office and found a hidden space in the shower room.\nInside was a safe with a security device.\nWhen he hacked and opened it, it contained a cylinder with a paper roll and a gold pattern on it and a tablet PC.\n'Extract all information in the tablet, Nano.'\n[Yes.]\nOf course, the tablet was secured, but Nano had no difficulty unlocking it. The tablet contained quite a lot of information.\nIt told about Hagar's Schedule. What caught Chun Yeowun's attention was that there was a monthly schedule to attend the black market auction of the MS Group.\n'What?'\nHe had no idea what MS would pop up here.\nLooking at Hagar's schedule, he knew that the man personally attended it and didn't send a proxy. Moreover, it was marked in red as if it was important, and it seemed like Hagar desperately needed something from the auction.\n'What?'\nThere was no further information.\nSo his gaze turned to the cylinder with a gold pattern.\n'How to open this?'\nHe tried to open it, but it didn't have a lid or device attached to it. And then Nano said,\n[It isn't an item from the earth.]\n'Not from earth?'\n[As a result of analyzing the materials, it is composed of substances that don't exist on earth.]\nChun Yeowun narrowed his eyes.\nIf so, then there was a high chance that this thing was from beyond the Gate, the place where these demons lived.\n'Any way to open it?'\n[I don't know since it isn't a human technology.]\n'Hm…'\nIf it couldn't be opened right away, then there was only one way to open it.\nBreak it open.\nChun Yeowun tried to break it with force, but it was so strong that nothing happened.\n'Cut it?'\nThis time, he raised sword energy and drew it to the cylinder.\nHe was careful to only cut the outer part and not damage what was inside.\nClash!\nBut nothing happened to it.\n'Then this?'\nChun Yeowun drew out an invisible sword and used it carefully. Once it was split open, it showed a paper inside.\nWhen he opened the large piece of paper which was rolled like a scroll, there was a picture on it.\nSeeing that, Chun Yeowun's eyes shone.\n'Huh? This…'\nIn the picture, there was an armour covering the entire body, but it looked familiar.\nIt was the armour's wrist guard, which surprisingly had the same shape as the one on Chun Yeowun's right hand.\n'Why are they so similar?'\nChun Yeowun, who was puzzled by it, unconsciously put his hand on the wrist guard in the picture.\nShhh!\n'What?'\nThe picture of the wrist guard came to life like an animation and then disassembled and changed to an image in the form of a sword.\nWhich was,\n'Sky Demon Sword!'",

      "content": "Chapter 132: TRA (3)\n'Why is Sky Demon Sword…?'\nChun Yeowun couldn't hide his shock at the image that turned to the Sky Demon Sword.\nHe thought that the wrist guards only looked alike, but this sword looked exactly the same as well.\nHe couldn't figure out why the Sky Demon Sword was included in this armour. Chun Yeowun, who had been looking at it in doubt, suddenly looked at another part of the armour.\nIt was the upper part.\n'Huh?'\nIn the picture, the upper body part of the armour looked familiar. Chun Yeowun, who was looking at it, pressed his finger on it.\nAnd once again, the armour came to life and its form changed, it turned into a staff.\n'Ice Cold Staff!'\nSurprisingly, it was the Ice Cold Staff, which was a divine item of the North Sea Ice Palace. The reason why Chun Yeowun knew about it was that he had gone to the Ice Palace to catch the Dragon Turtle in his time.\nAt that time, he managed to get the staff, a lost sacred object of the palace, and took it back to the Cult.\n'But the colours are different.'\nHe didn't know it right away because it was in the same dark colour as the Sky Demon Sword, but this staff was definitely the same one.\nThe surface of the Ice Cold Staff was painted with gold, so recognizing it at a glance was impossible.\n'Ha!'\nWas the divine item of the North a part of this set?\n'How could such a thing happen?'\nAs Chun Yoewun knew, the Sky Demon Sword was a sword made from a meteorite that fell from the sky.\nAnd he suddenly thought.\n'Wait, wasn't the staff made from a meteorite too?'\nHe remembered the story he heard from Dan Jucheon, a person he recruited from the Ice Palace.\n[The staff is an item made from a meteorite which fell in the Yunnan region by Dan Yeong, the first Lord of the Ice Palace.]\nThe common denominator of the two items.\nBoth were made from meteorites that fell from the sky.\nHowever, looking at the picture, it was as if the item was already a completed one.\n'Just what could this be?'\nWhen he pressed the other armour parts, they transformed into various weapons.\nThe left wrist guard turned into a sword, and the helmet turned into a weapon resembling a wheel.\nHelmet, upper body, lower body, left and right arm, and leg guards. A set of armour which turned to seven weapons.\n'This is a paper from this cylinder, not from Earth, but I don't know why two items that I know about were in the picture.'\nA huge question.\nBoth people who made the weapons from the meteorites had left records of how it was made, so why did this picture show them?\n'Thinking about it, the staff had the spirit of the Great Bird.'\nNo famous or strong sword could withstand the spiritual energy of a Beast.\nHowever, the staff managed to hold it just like the Sky Demon Sword. It could also absorb the power of the Gate beings' cores.\n'I should have brought it.'\nOne unfortunate thing was, after absorbing the spirit of the Great Bird, Chun Yeowun gave it to Dan Jucheon as a reward for his loyalty.\nHe heard that when the Black Sky company disbanded, the Dan clan left for Russia.\n'I need to call them back.'\nHe had to get that thing to be sure.\n'I don't have much time, this much should be enough.'\nAs Chun Yeowun rolled the paper ready to leave, he looked at a unique pattern written near the top of the paper, which he didn't pay much attention to in the start.\n'This… a letter? Nano? Can you understand it?'\n[The regularity of strikes says it is a letter, but it is confirmed as a language not registered in my programming.]\nNaturally, the letters weren't from Earth, so Nano couldn't understand it.\n'I guess I need to ask Shakena or Deo.'\nThere were two demons he could ask about this thing. That was when Chun Yeowun heard someone's voice.\n-Lord\nIt was Hu Bong.\nUnlike him, who came here to catch Hagar, Hu Bong went with Bi Mak-heon, Yu So-hwa, Im So-hye and the other members to the area of TRA.\n‘Have you reached Fuyang?’\n-Lord. I think you should come sooner than later. Not to Fuyang city, but what was this place? Hold on… ah! It is said to be southeast of Huainan.\n'Huainan city?'\nHuainan wasn’t far from Fuyang. This meant that the presence of the TRA entity had moved.\n-Can you hear me? It is the first time I have seen such a thing. Right now, it looks to be a sea of fire all around the place. Strange things have come out and explosions occurred everywhere…\nIt was being transmitted through their brain messages because of the Nano bomb, so the surrounding sounds couldn't be heard.\n'Hu Bong, just wait. I'll be there soon.'\nAt the same time.\nA large number of troops gathered in Huainan city.\nHundreds of tanks and flying aircrafts were constantly firing missiles, filling the night sky with flames and smoke.\nBang! Bang!\nThe place where the bombing took place was around 1.5km to the front.\nIt was a place slightly off to the east side of the wall, and the constant bombing made the area turn into a wasteland.\nHowever, what was even more impressive was behind the bombing.\nEven in the blurred vision, most of the destroyed buildings in the region had green smoke rising up.\nLike Fuyang, Huainan city was a death city. Fortunately, all the citizens were asked to leave beforehand.\n\"Shoot! Don't stop the shelling!\"\nThe command post was about two hundred metres behind the tanks.\nThe camp was in a heavy truck.\nIt was meaningless to set up a garrison in this place when the being was constantly moving and when they had to continue bombing.\n\"C-commander. I don't think the missiles can do much.\"\nAt the subordinate's words, major general Yu Young-kang, the commander, went stiff.\nTwo divisions have already been killed since they've started. This was now the location of the third line of defence.\nAlthough there was no way for the military to act, they only used the bombing to stop that being from moving.\nBeep!\n\"Commander! Again the radioactive levels are skyrocketing!\"\nA sergeant monitoring it shouted.\n\"Where?\"\n\"In the direction of the ZRV-30s 2nd tank's coordinates 32.714957, 117.105750 are within range.\"\n\"Damn it!\"\nCommander Yu Young-kang went to pick up the radio.\n\"Captain of tank 2! Move right away…\"\nBefore he could even finish his words, a green light appeared on the monitor screen.\nAnd then, the green light turned into a straight line.\nDuuuuuu!\nAt that moment, the heavy truck shook. It was so strong that the monitors were tumbling out of their places.\nKwakwakwang!\nThe sound of an explosion.\nThe officers in the truck fell down. When the vibration and thudding stopped, Yu Young-kang looked at the monitor showing ZRV-30s. His face went stiff.\n\"No…\"\nThe ground was dug deep, and green smoke was blowing out. The place was devastated.\nWith one hit, hundreds of tanks were wiped out.\n'How can this thing be stopped?'\nIt was frustrating. If this continued, the entity would absorb the energy around and destroy everything.\nAs one could see, its power was dangerous enough to be called the worst.\nHowever, unless they bombed it, the being wouldn't stop moving.\n'In the end, will we sacrifice the military to stop it from moving?'\nRight now, that was the role of the National Guard. The moment they would stop, the being would head for Bengbu city.\nSince the evacuation was still happening in that place, they had to do their best to stop it from moving. At that time, the second lieutenant in charge of defence radioed.\n\"Commander. The director has contacted.\"\nDirector meant the head of the Ministry of Defence. He couldn't ignore it, so he raised his hand and saluted to the radio.\n“Loyalty! Yu Young-kang here sir!”\nAfter receiving the radio, his expression turned strange.\nSoon after the radio ended, Yu Young-kang gave the orders.\n\"Stop the bombing right away.\nA high hill about 300 metres south of the military base. There were people in protective suits.\nMurim warriors with weapons and Gate Keepers. Many strong people were called out.\nRing!\nMilitary trucks continued to come in with reinforcements. As the situation was serious, they had to bring people from various places to this spot.\nA large number of well-known Murims and Keepers had joined. And even they couldn't hide their nervousness.\nWhisper!\nEveryone had serious faces as they looked at the green light that rose from the 2km destroyed region. It was their first time seeing a being withstand such a massive bombing.\n\"Uh?\"\n\"Bombing stopped?\"\nThe bombing had stopped. As a result, the Murims and Keepers grew more nervous. The meaning was simple.\nIt was time for them to be deployed.\n\"Oh! Is that it? This is great.\"\nA man wearing a protective suit worn by Keepers with a large iron box on the back of the truck which just arrived, looked out and seemed amazed.\nEveryone was serious, but this one seemed excited.\n'What is with him?'\n'Is he here for a picnic?'\nIt made other people feel uncomfortable.\nNot just that, there were a few people who were trembling too.\n\"Wow. It is huge. \"\nIt was Hu Bong.\nBi Mak-heon, who was next to him, nodded with a stiff face.\nAs the smoke covering the bombing area went away, the figure of the being was revealed.\nAlmost 120 metres tall.\nThe appearance of the hard-looking shell which seemed like armour on the body, and numerous thorns on the head and back. A gigantic monster one would only see in movies.\nAnd that wasn't the only problem.\nAs the gigantic monster was visible because of the reduced smoke, it showed that there were 20 beasts of 20 to 30 metres in size crouching.\nThey were smaller than the huge one, but still huge.\nIt seemed like the giant one took the bombing and saved them.\n\"Crazy! Even those small ones are the size of Alpha entities.\"\n\"How can we catch them?\"\nIt was uncertain if anything could survive the bombing. In the end, it seemed like getting rid of the cores and attacking the weak spots was the only way out.\nBrung!\nA truck arrived. And a man in a protective suit with seven large sharp wheels on the back arrived.\nIt was Seo Jang-ryeong.\nOne of the special officers of the public Security and one of the Five Great Warriors with the name of Chil Ryun-jae.\n\"Have you waited for long? Now is the time to hunt! Everyone.\"\nHe spoke loud and clear.\nThe Murim people who recognized him were delighted.\n\"Chil Ryun-jae!\"\n\"One of the Five came!\"\nA captain wasn't appointed for this. However, it seemed like Seo Jang-ryeong took it.\n\"This dangerous entity is the worst thing ever! It is designated as TRA and could be called S-class. If the forces aren't joined together, that monster will slaughter millions of civilians.\"\nSeo Jang-ryeong began to give a speech to the Keepers and Murim warriors to stop them from splitting into teams.\nJudging from his age, ability and leadership qualities, there was no way anyone could replace him, so everyone stayed silent.\nBut not everyone was like that.\nOne of them stepped ahead.\n\"Are you the Chil Ryun-jae of Five Great Warriors?\"\n\"Ha?\"\nA person in large iron armour stepped ahead. It was Sayogi.\nHe was aiming to be the best of Murim, so he was itching for a fight as soon as he saw Seo Jang-ryeong.\n\"Yes. Young friend. The situation is urgent so let's talk later. Then the Keepers of Team C will…\"\nIt was urgent, so Seo Jang-ryeong tried to continue his instructions but,\n\"After we take care of the monster, how about fighting with me?\"\nSeyogi interrupted again. Everyone thought he was a Murim warrior who was excited to see one of the Five Great Warriors, but when he asked for a fight, Seo Jang-ryeong's face contorted.\nHe was annoyed, but he resisted.\n\"I am well aware that the young friend is motivated, so stop now, and wait for the instructions.\"\nHowever, Sayogi didn't stop.\n\"Is it so hard to accept the request for a battle?\"\nIn the end, Seo Jang-ryeong warned with anger.\n\"I see that words don't work with you. I won't forgive you if you interrupt me anymore…\"\nShhh!\n'!?'\nBefore the words were done, Sayogi's hand went for Seo Jang-ryeong's neck.\nHe wasn't aiming to kill, but the sharp energy from the hand touched the neck.\n\"I wonder if my challenge was taken lightly. I treated you with courtesy since you were strong, but I guess you lack manners.\"\nSeo Jang-ryeong looked at the man with a stiff face.\nIf this man was determined, he could have extended his hand a little more and killed him.\n'… who is he?'\nAt this level, this man could be the same, no higher than him. He was shocked when someone shouted.\n\"L-look over there!\"\nThe eyes of those who watched the two turned to other places.\nIt was none other than a colossal monster. And a small human figure floating in the air with a monster.\n\"What? Is he flying?\"\n\"Who is he?\"\nSince it was dark, no one could see anything.\nThe man raised his hand, and countless blue swords appeared in all directions around the monster.\n\"No… No way!\"\nSeo Jang-ryeong was startled, forgetting the hand close to his neck.\n'Are they all Air Swords?'\nWhen the black form lowered his hand, the Air Swords from all directions exploded at the monster and the small ones around it.\nSwoosh! Kwakwakwang!\nSeeing that, Hu Bong smiled.\n\"Sky Flash! Lord is here!\"\nIt was one of Chun Yeowun's famous skills, the Sky Flash.\nChun Yeowun, who was expected to arrive later, had come.\nSayogi watched the scene and mumbled with twinkling eyes.\n\"Not this one. But he is the strongest one.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 133: TRA (4)\nKaiju.\nLiterally called a monster, it appeared 7 years ago. The Alpha-class dangerous entity Kaiju, which descended from the S-class Gate, had turned three cities into cities of death.\nUnlike the other cities, it was difficult to rebuild these 3 because of the heavy radiation. Therefore, it was given a Restricted Area (RA) rating, which couldn’t be resolved since the First Gate Dimension Gate opening.\nAnd access to it was forbidden.\n‘Is that him?’\nCommander Yu Young-kang’s eyes didn’t leave the monitor showing Chun Yeowun floating in the air.\nOther officers assumed that the attack was stopped in order for the Murim warriors and the Gate Keepers to be deployed, but the reality was different.\n[Only that man can stop it.]\nThat man, which Ahn Woo-hong was raving about.\nAhn Woo-hong called this man to be the best and said that he possessed stronger abilities than any Keeper or Murim warrior. Whether that was true or not would soon be decided.\nSwosh!\n“Wow!”\n“W-what was that?”\nThe officers exclaimed constantly. It was clearly visible on the monitor.\nThousands of Air Swords.\nKwakwakwakwang\n!\nThe enormous number of Air Swords which directly pierced into the body of a 120 meter long Alpha Kaiju.\nIt was more than just missile bombing.\nIt seemed like these swords could push out the Kaiju any time.\nHowever,\n‘What?’\nChun Yeowun frowned.\nThe Air Swords kept hitting the Kaiju, yet he couldn’t feel a single attack working on it. Rather, it gradually made the Kaiju stronger.\nAt that moment, Nano said.\n[Radiation level is rising rapidly.]\n‘Radiation?’\nIt was then.\nThe green light began to condense and the Kaiju, which couldn’t be seen because of the Air Sword bombing, began to rise.\nWooong!\n‘He?’\nThe condensed green light was radiation.\nChun Yeowun noticed the Kaiju opening its mouth as the radiation breathed out from it.\nPing! Swosssh!\nA green ray crossed the air and precisely aimed at Chun Yeowun.\nThe speed it was emitted with was unbelievable, and even the thickness of the beam was enormous, which meant it couldn’t be avoided by teleportation.\n‘Hmm.’\nChun Yeowun raised his sword. In an instant, an invisible sword energy rose.\nSlash!\nChun Yeowun tried to cut the green ray coming at him, but the destructive power of the beam itself was the sum of energy the Sky Flash possessed.\nAnd with such speed and power.\nBang!\n‘This!’\nThe invisible sword was unable to cut it and Chun Yeowun ended up bouncing back. As a result, Chun Yeowun’s figure was swept away by the green light and disappeared.\nPapapang!\nAnd with the beam, the wind moved around like a storm. Both the Murim warriors and the Keepers couldn’t hide their shock.\n“No way!”\n“Oh my… can that even be caught?”\nThey all believed that Kaiju, which was hit with thousands of Air Swords, would definitely take damage.\nBut even that looked unsuccessful since there wasn’t a single scratch on it.\n‘… is it even possible for Air Swords to not work?’\nSeo Jang-ryeong went stiff. He tried to confirm that Air Swords could do something. As a warrior of Supreme Master level, he wanted to know if his best technique would work or not.\n‘It cannot be caught.’\nWhen Seo Jang-ryeong realized that it didn’t work, he fell into despair. To compare it, it was like trying to break a rock with an egg.\nOf course, not everyone was filled with fear and horror.\n“It’s my turn.”\nSayogi saw this as an opportunity. Although he lost the chance to compete with Chun Yeowun, who was swept away, he would be able to call himself the best if this monster was taken down.\n‘Grandpa told me not to go, but I will prove that I am the strongest in martial arts.’\nSayogi didn’t leave Death valley with his grandfather’s permission. The man looking after him never allowed him to go.\nAnd it has been almost 90 years now.\nSo his desire to be the strongest grew.\n‘I’ll prove my power here.’\nWhile everyone was stunned, Sayogi tried to rush to the Kaiju. It was then that someone blocked him.\nHu Bong.\n“Wait.”\n“What is it?”\n“It isn’t over yet, so wait.”\nChun Yeowun instructed hu Bong to prevent anyone else from getting close, so he stopped Sayogi from participating in the war to fulfil those orders.\n“It is done. Haven’t you seen it too?”\n“Lord isn’t someone who will lose so easily. My Lord has the greatest power under him.”\n“Lord, Ah… he is your Lord?”\n“Yes.”\nHu Bong answered proudly when Sayogi continued.\n“It must be tragic to lose your Lord, but the title for being the strongest will be in my hands.”\n“What?”\nIt wasn’t spoken in a way to provoke the opponent.\nBut since the words were casually told, Hu Bong felt enraged.\n“How dare you!”\nHu Bong reached out to subdue him. At that moment, Sayogi swiftly evaded Hu Bong’s hand.\n‘You?’\nHu Bong brought out Fire qi on his hands.\nWheik!\nSayogi took a step back. It was a brief jump in the air and that was enough for Hu Bong to know that Sayogi wasn’t an ordinary warrior.\n‘He is strong.’\nWhich meant this man wasn’t just casually spouting those words.\nShhh!\nHu Bong pulled out the sword he had on the back. He acknowledged that this enemy wasn’t someone he could easily deal with.\nSeeing that, Sayogi pointed his finger backwards and said,\n“I don’t think this is the time for us to argue like this. Aren’t we supposed to stop that monster?”\nGrrrrr!\nThe ground shook. The Kaiju, which blew Chun Yeowun with a beam, moved.\nNot just that one thing, but even those smaller versions of it moved ahead. Their goal seemed to be to advance towards the National Guard.\n“Lord.”\nHu Bong frowned. He wondered if Chun Yeowun was really injured. And not missing the chance, someone passed by him.\nSwosh!\n“That bastard!”\nHe flew with great speed while wearing that iron armour.\nThe fact that he was able to move in the air meant that he was stronger than most.\n“He is flying!”\n“No way. Doesn’t that mean he is also a Supreme Master?”\nThe Murims couldn’t hide their shock. The Supreme Master level is something that only five people have managed to achieve.\n“Over there!”\nEven Hu Bong, who followed the man, was moving in the air. At that sight, Seo Jang-ryeong frowned.\n‘Just… what the hell is this?’\nIn a few minutes, three more warriors appeared. From his point of view, a large number of strong people had appeared.\nFlustered, Bi Mak-heon spoke to Yu So-hwa.\n“Secretary Yu, shouldn’t they be stopped?”\nIt seemed like she could stop them. At that, Yu So-hwa shook her head and answered.\n“I don’t see any need to do that.”\n“Sorry?”\nBi Mak-heon’s face brightened as he looked at where she looked.\nMeanwhile, Sayogi’s heart pounded while he ran towards the Kaiju. Finally, he had the chance to showcase his White Sword Martial Arts to the world.\nRumble!\nHe could see that monster moving ahead. As Sayogi pretended to raise his hand lightly, the iron lid on the box behind him opened, revealing several weapons.\n36 kinds of weapons.\nWheik!\nAt that moment, Sayogi hurriedly turned to the left as he felt fire behind him.\nThe flame sphere passed.\n‘This is?’\n“Didn’t I tell you to stop!”\nWhen he saw Hu Bong closely following him, Sayogi shook his head.\n“You really are a stubborn man. In that case.”\nHe held onto a dagger in his left hand and a sword in the right.\nHe then extended his hand ahead.\nAt that moment, four weapons escaped from the iron armour. A sword, a blade, a spear and a spiked wheel.\n‘White Sword Martial Arts!’\nThe four weapons rushed for Hu Bong. Surprisingly, it wasn’t a simple movement.\nAll four of them moved differently like four different warriors were handling them.\n‘Such strong technique.’\nHu Bong was startled and stopped as he unfolded the Illusion Sword technique.\nThe sword drew numerous shadows and created a dense net, it was to block the weapons from approaching.\nChachacha!\nHu Bong’s eyes trembled.\n‘What the hell is this…’\nIt was the first time he had seen something like this.\nCompletely different movement of weapons from a single master taking advantage of the gap as if the weapons had a mind of their own.\n“Huh!”\nWheik!\nHu Bong brought out the Fire qi. It was because he knew that no normal technique could go against this.\nHe used the fire with the Illusion Sword technique.\nWheik!\nThe sword was engulfed in flames, further developing the mesh-like form.\nChachachang!\nAll four weapons were blocked, and they bounced back, making Sayogi look surprised.\n“Ha. Blocking that. You must have such great skills, but it is a waste to serve under others.”\nContrary to his expectations, as this man managed to subdue his weapons, Sayogi was now drenched in winning over him.\n“Then let’s see if you can stop this.”\nAs Sayogi raised his hand upwards, four additional weapons escaped from the iron armour, and when he reached out, they once again aimed for Hu Bong.\nThat was when he heard a sound from behind.\nThud! Thud! Thud!\n“Huh?”\nHe looked behind and saw one of the 30 metres tall Kaiju rushing ahead with great speed.\nIt seemed like it walked out of the group after seeing these two fight.\n“Kuaaaaak!”\nIts roar was terrifying. And each step it took was making the floor vibrate.\n“You must have a death wish.”\nSayogi reached for the Kaiju. And the four weapons which were going for Hu Bong soon changed direction and rushed for the monster.\nSwoosh!\n“For monsters which prey on humans, death is your only end.”\nHe saw that sword energy wouldn’t work on it, so what should he do?\nHe didn’t stop.\nGooooo!\nWhen Sayogi’s eyes gleamed with a red light, the energy roared, and the blue sword energy turned red.\nSwish!\n‘What amazing energy.’\nEven Hu Bong went stiff at it. It was the first time that he felt goosebumps in this world.\n“Let’s show you what you are dealing with.”\nEight weapons with blood-stained energy flew towards the Kaiju. And they crossed together to hit it.\nKwak! Kwak!\n“Kuaaaak!”\nA roar of pain erupted from the Kaiju’s mouth. Surprisingly, it managed to penetrate its body which couldn’t be dealt with by sword energy.\nHowever, even the weapons couldn’t penetrate its body.\n‘It is strong.’\nAs Sayogi waved his hand, the weapons moved. It was meant to pierce the body with a drill-like movement.\n“Kuaaaak!”\nSwosh!\nGreen light flashed from the Kaiju’s mouth, and then the breath was fired.\nSayogi flew up.\nHe could avoid it because the beam was smaller than the Alpha’s.\n“I just don’t want to get it!”\nAs Sayogi stretched out his hand, eight more weapons flew out.\n“It is the first time I use 16 weapons against a monster, handle this with pride!”\nSayogi stretched out his hand, and the 8 weapons flew towards the Kaiju’s head.\nThe weapons were divided to attack the eyes, nose, mouth and chin.\n‘Hard!’\nSweat dripped from Sayogi’s forehead. Handling 18 weapons at once wasn’t easy. Even after training for decades, just a minor loss of concentration and the technique would be lost in an instant.\nKwakwakwang!\nFinally, the weapons that were targeting the head completely penetrated it.\nSeeming to be in pain, the Kaiju ran ahead.\n“Kuaaaak!”\nIt ran wild in all directions and soon fell to the floor.\nThud!\nSeeing that, Sayogi smiled.\nHe wiped the sweat off his forehead and looked at Hu Bong.\n“See that? That monster is no match for me. If you want to stop them, then don’t disturb me anymore. I will deal with all the monsters here.”\nHu Bong smirked at that statement.\n“Look behind you.”\n“Behind?”\nSayogi turned to see what this man was talking about, the vibration from the ground had vanished. And Sayogi looked up and noticed that the Kaiju which was marching for the National Guard stopped moving.\nTremble!\nSomething was holding the Kaiju in check, black shadows came out and were holding its lower body.\n‘What is that thing?’\nThat wasn’t the only thing.\nCrack!\nThe feet were gradually dug down. A great deal of pressure seemed to be put on the monster.\n“This… Heavenly Master?”\nIt wasn’t a common thing.\nThe energy gathered around crushing the Kaiju was enormous.\nBut thanks to that, the movement stopped. It was none other than Chun Yeowun who did such a thing.\nHz lowered his palm, and the energy within nature moved according to it.\n“What the hell are we witnessing right now?”\n“Is he suppressing that thing with energy?”\nThe Murim people who watched it couldn’t hide their shock.\nChun Yeowun, whom they thought to have been dead, was alive and holding the monster in one place.\nSeo Jang-ryeong mumbled as he couldn’t understand this anymore.\n“I can’t believe it… a Heavenly Master… it actually exists…”\nSeo Jang-ryeong, who felt the energy in the surroundings move, was amazed at it.\n“Heavenly?”\nWhisper!\nAt that, whispers spread around. The world ‘Heavenly Master’ was something people considered a legend.\nThud!\nThe 120 metres long Kaiju stepped out. Having gotten a bit used to the energy stopping it, it gradually moved and the mouth began to turn green.\n“It is doing that again!”\n“Man! You need to avoid it!”\nThe Murim warriors shouted for Chun Yeowun.\nThey considered Chun Yeowun lucky to have survived the first time, and were scared he would be now hit for real.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun flew towards the monster.\n“Ugh?”\n“It is dangerous!”\nThe Alpha opened its mouth and then released the breath at Chun Yeowun.\nChun Yeowun swung the Sky Demon Sword in his hand and the breath was slashed.\n“I-It was slashed!”\nThe radiation breath was divided into two and spread out in other directions, and Chun Yeowun aimed for the neck.\nIt was then,\nSlash!\nHe drew the sword.\nAs a black line formed on the Alpha Kaiju’s neck, the space shook.\nCreep!\nThe moment everyone felt the creepy energy, they saw it, the neck of the Alpha Kaiju seemed to slowly fall down.\n“I-it was cut!”\n“The neck of the monster belonging to RA class!”\nEveryone was so startled that they couldn’t take their eyes off it.\nKukukuku!\nSuch a huge head, finally fell to the ground.\nThud! Thud!\nThe small Kaijus, which looked at the rolling Alpha Kaiju’s head, began to scream.\n“Kuaaak!”\n“Kyaaaak!”\nAs if they could recognize that their leader was dead.\nBut it didn’t last long.\nBefore long, Chun Yeowun’s sword went for their heads too.\nClash! Clash!\nEach time the sword was swung, a head would fall off.\nIt was utterly devastating.\nLooking at Sayogi who was biting his lip, Hu Bong grinned.\n“Hehe, that is the level that can be called as the best in the world. Kid.”",

      "content": "Chapter 134: Heavenly Killing Star (1)\nThere was a man who couldn't hear the sound.\n'What is that sword?'\nHis eyes fluttered as he had seen the dawn of heaven and earth.\nEverything in the path of the sword split. Even space.\n\"Ha!\"\nAn absolute state of a sword that couldn't be understood.\n'What my grandpa said must be true.'\nHis grandfather had repeated the story over and over again during the 90 years that they lived together.\nThe words were always repeated that he was anxious to get out of Death Valley.\nOne time he was about to go out.\n[Best person? What nonsense is that? If that was so easy, then this old man would have taken over Murim a long time ago.]\n[Wouldn't that be possible if grandpa makes up his mind?]\n[Nothing is easy like that. And do you think that you can defeat all the warriors with your inexperienced skills?]\n[Huh. I don't believe in that anymore. That man who came to me at that time said that no one other than my grandfather and myself could be my opponent. And since you have stepped back, am I not the strongest?]\n[Tch tch, that damned man whom I accepted, he caused such a mess.]\n[What now? But he is right.]\n[Don't spew nonsense. You don't know the scary things about the Murim. It is a place where new things keep happening. And you will end up getting hurt because of the stupid things you are doing.]\n[I know that you are doing this to scare me. Huh!]\n[Yah. It isn't a lie. Walls are everywhere. Not just for me but for you too.]\n[Ehh. Even then, I will overcome it. What kind of wall was it for grandpa.]\nThe man didn't respond.\n[Grandpa… is there really a wall?]\nWith a stiff face, he admitted,\n[There was. Two of them.]\nQuite a surprising statement. An old man who could never be defeated said such a thing.\n[What exaggeration.]\n[You bastard. That is no exaggeration.]\n[Then who are they? Let me listen to those names.]\n[How would knowing the names of the dead help you?]\n[Ehh?]\nDead. The two people his grandfather couldn't overcome have died.\n[It is fine. I want to fight them again, but time has taken them away. In the end, life turns into history. Don't fall for delusions and focus on what you need to do.]\nHe kept asking for their names, but the old man never told him.\nAfter trying endless times to no avail, he thought that the grandfather was using that as an excuse to keep him from leaving.\nHowever, after seeing that person's sword technique, he knew for sure.\n'His words are right. There are strong people in Murim. That red-haired man too.'\nIt was quite strange. He was confronted with a monster with such overwhelming ability, but rather than feeling fear, his determination soared.\nDespite knowing that he couldn't compete, he wanted to bump into the man.\n'Uncle Ark said it too. Only by bumping into those higher than us can we get stronger.'\nThe battle between the grandfather and that man was so familiar. At this point, he wondered if he could also get stronger while competing with this monster.\nSayogi flew to the place where the Kaiju were buried.\nPhat!\n\"Uh? Yah!\"\nHu Bong, who came to his senses, was shocked.\n'He still wants to compete with my Lord? Ha!'\nHu Bong rushed after him thinking he should stop the man.\nMeanwhile, Chun Yeowun managed to deal with the small Kaiju.\n'Huh?'\nAt that moment, a strange thought appeared in his mind. It was dangerous, so he dealt with the small Kaijus, but since there was one thing left, curiosity arose.\n'Can this be made into a ghost?'\nThere was nothing wrong with checking. He knew demons couldn't be turned into ghosts, so this monster shouldn't too.\nBut Chun Yeowun decided to check nonetheless.\nClash!\nAfter cutting through the thick skin, Chun Yeowun used the Sky Demon Sword and Ghost qi.\nWoong!\nA blue light flowed in along with the resonating sword. The life inside the body began to drain at once.\nShhhh!\nAnd then the body turned white.\n'It worked!'\nAbsorbing life meant that it could be turned into a ghost. It took a while as the body was huge.\nAnd about 50 seconds later, the entire 30 meters tall Kaiju's body paled.\nSomething opaque was about to appear. Not missing the chance, he absorbed the Ghost into the sword.\nSwoosh!\nIt took longer than human-sized ghosts. And fortunately, no one seemed to notice that.\n'So this can be turned into a ghost.'\nAn unexpected benefit. The disappointing thing was that if he had known from the beginning, he would have tried it right away.\nHowever, considering the time it took, this was fine enough.\n'Even this little monster can be handled only by a Supreme Master.'\nAll that was left was to retrieve the core inside the Alpha's body. And since he could absorb the abilities of an S-class ghost, maybe he could absorb the core of the Kaiju with the ability.\nAnd when he was approaching it.\nKwang! Kwang!\n'Hm?'\nThe sound of an explosion. When he looked at it, he could see a sphere of flame coming.\nSomeone was flying while avoiding those spheres.\nIt was Sayogi in his armour.\n'What is it?'\nPerhaps because of how skilled he was, the man didn't even turn back to check which direction the spheres were coming from.\n'Seems pretty good.'\nHu Bong, who was shooting out flame spheres, suddenly stopped as the man arrived in front of Chun Yeowun.\n\"Lord! No need to worry. I can…\"\nSh!\nChun Yeowun raised his hand and said it was fine.\nHe then asked.\n\"What is it? What business do you have with me?\"\nAt Chun Yeowun's question, Sayogi took the chance and answered in a confident voice.\n\"I am Sayogi, the second hair to the White Blade Martial clan from Death Valley. I formally ask for a duel with you.\"\n\"Duel?\"\nChun Yeowun's brows went up.\nIt was the first time anyone had appeared out of the blue and asked for a duel. That too after witnessing everything he just did.\n\"This bastard is trying out his luck!\"\nHu Bong couldn't contain his anger, if Chun Yeowun hadn't given an order to not act out, he would have attacked Sayogi.\nSuddenly, Chun Yeowun remembered something.\n'Death Valley?'\nIt was his second time hearing it after coming here.\nNarrowing his eyes, Chun Yeowun asked.\n\"You. Are you from the Death Valley which is in Mount Bigol?\"\n\"Oh! You know of Death Valley? It is the first time since coming here that someone knew about it.\"\nWhen Sayogi met someone who knew the place he came from, he couldn't hide his excitement.\n'Hmmm.'\nChun Yeowun looked at the man, and noticed that the energy from him wasn't normal.\n'But… not so strong either.'\nThis man didn't seem strong enough to overwhelm the demon Hagar. At least, from the energy oozing out, this was the conclusion he could come up with.\n'Weapons?'\nChun Yeowun naturally looked at the armour Sayogi had. And the 36 weapons.\nLooking back, Hagar's skin had traces of numerous weapon wounds on it.\n'Lacking.'\nThe weapon wounds on Hagar exceeded 36. Just on the face and neck were scars from 50 different types of weapons.\nStaring inside the box, Chun Yeowun asked.\n\"Apart from these weapons, are there any more?\"\nSayogi seemed visibly shocked at Chun Yeowun's question.\n\"How did you know?\"\n\"You must have had a mentor.\"\nAnd that reaction itself told Chun Yeowun that this guy had a mentor.\nPerhaps, the mentor could handle more.\n'Who is he?'\nWith a strange vigilance, the man approached Chun Yeowun who seemed to keep getting things right.\n\"Who are you?\"\nSayogi raised the energy and asked.\nChun Yeowun didn't care and asked, \"What is your mentor's name?\"\n\"I don't know.\"\nChun Yeowun frowned at those words. Sayogi didn't even know the name of his own grandfather, all that he knew was that he was made to live in the mountains and the old man was the leader and Lord of White Blade Martial clan.\n\"Are you hiding it?\"\n\"I mean it. I learned martial arts from my grandfather.\"\n\"Grandfather?\"\nLooking at his eyes, it didn't seem to be a lie, when Chun Yeowun opened his mouth to ask again…\nShh!\nSayogi brought out a blade with his left and a sword with his right hand.\nAnd then all the weapons inside came out.\nChun Yeowun asked in a low voice.\n\"What are you up to?\"\n\"I didn't ask for a duel in this way. All we are doing is talking. A man talks with weapons like this!\"\nSayogi reached for Chun Yeowun and all 36 weapons made their way to him. Each in a different way.\nSwoosh!\n'This man wasn't doing his all against me?'\nHu Bong was shocked at it. All 36 weapons with different trajectories and techniques.\nChachachacha!\n'Everything is different.'\nChun Yeowun was surprised too. This seemed a lot more fresh than the battle he had with Hagar.\nNo matter how good a warrior is, handling more than 12 different weapons would take a toll.\n'4th technique of White Blade Marital clan!'\nThe 4th technique involved 36 techniques unfolded with each weapon.\nAmong them, the 1st technique would aim for the target. Chun Yeowun, who felt interested in it, picked up the Sky Demon Sword.\nShhh!\n\"It's been a long time since I had a showdown with techniques.\"\nHaving seen such a raging one, it was natural that he wanted to fight.\nAnd like the name, it seemed like a flooding sea.\nChun Yeowun stood still with his left arm behind his back and swung the sword lightly.\n'Should I try it with the Supreme Sky Demon Sword?'\nSupreme Sky Demon Sword.\nThe best swordsmanship of the Sky Demon Order created by the Chun Ma.\nIn the past, Chun Yeowun couldn't, but now, he was able to perform it without having to tackle anything.\nChachach!\n24 exquisite sword techniques in harmony.\n'Is he making fun of me? To stand so carelessly and spread his sword technique?'\nAs Sayogi felt like he was being ignored, his intent to win raged.\nAnd finally the two men collided.\nChachachacha!\nAs the Sky Demon Sword and the 36 weapons collided, sparks flew.\nAnd despite all that happening, Chun Yeowun's eyes didn't even close for a second and kept looking at the techniques that each of the 36 weapons were unfolding.\n'They aren't entirely different.'\nIf the weapon was being controlled one by one, then the movement of them should be more fluid, but each time a weapon bounced back, it didn't move right away.\nDespite that, with bloody training, the man was able to handle 36 weapons.\n'The one who managed to make this technique has to be a great master.'\nIt was the first time that Chun Yeowun felt like this after witnessing Ark Wei's unification of energy.\n'He is blocking without moving a single step?'\nUnlike Chun Yeowun who analysed the techniques, Sayogi was shocked at this.\nHe had no idea that his opponent would respond so easily.\n'Then, 2nd technique.'\nSayogi went straight to another technique. The technique which was like flowing water till then suddenly changed into numerous soldiers rushing at the enemy.\nChachachacha!\nHowever, Chun Yeowun blocked that too without taking a single step away.\nSayogi, who was unfolding new things, was pushed back.\n'Such incredible force.'\nEach time their weapons clashed, his heart would beat wildly.\nThinking that he couldn't keep moving back, Sayogi decided to unfold another technique as a desperate attempt.\n'Enclosed!'\nThe 36 weapons encircled Chun Yeowun. At the same time, the weapons began to unfold.\nEven if one of them was blocked, the other weapons would surely aim for other parts making the opponent immobile.\nChachachachang!\nChun Yeowun stopped the sword which came for him with his right arm.\nAnd it was the moment the other 35 were coming…\n'I see it.'\nSayogi stretched out the sword. At that moment, the sword moved through the gap created.\nHis sword was moving at an angle that couldn't be noticed.\nPak!\n'No?'\nChun Yeowun grabbed the sword with his two fingers, and Sayogi, who didn't think that it could be stopped, couldn't hide his shock.\n\"It is a pretty nice technique. Aiming for the blindspot when other techniques unfold.\"\nEnergy formed around Chun Yeowun's fingers.\nAnd,\nCrack!\nThe blade between the pinched fingers broke.\n\"My Sword!\"\nSayogi's face distorted when the age-old sword broke. He was angry that his dear old friend was broken.\n\"You broke my sword!\"\nIntense rage emanated from Sayogi's body.\nGoo!\nThe energy he was giving out now was different. The energy moved like a raging storm and seemed terrifying.\n'That energy again.'\nHu Bong frowned as he felt it. That energy which seemed more evil than just trying to kill someone.\nAnd when Sayogi's eyes turned red, the weapons were dyed in blood red.\n'This is?'\nChun Yeowun narrowed his eyes at Sayogi's aura, which had become a lot stronger than before.\nIt's hard to believe that this is coming from the same person.\nPhat!\nSayogi held a spear and threw it at Chun Yeowun.\nHe, who had narrowed the distance in an instant, wanted to devour Chun Yeowun.\n\"Kuaaaah!\"\nChachachacha!\nIt was like madness itself. It seemed like Sayogi had turned anxious at the fact that he was unable to kill Chun Yeowun.\nClaclaclaclang!\nChun Yeowun didn't move a single step and lightly moved his sword to counter it.\nAs the attacks didn't keep working, Sayogi's face turned more and more distorted. T\nChun Yeowun spoke,\n\"It's the first time seeing this. Heavenly Killing Star\"\n'!?'\nAt Chun Yeowun's words, Sayogi's face went stiff.\nHis eyes which were filled with madness now regained their focus.\n'This. I lost my mind for a second.'\nSayogi bit his lip. There were two things his grandfather made him promise.\nHe was told to not reveal the fact that he had been alive for a long time, and to never let anyone find out that he is the Heavenly Killing Star.\nHeavenly Killing Star is a spirit born from the stars that govern death.\nBorn with a cursed fate to randomly kill all living things through his lifespan.\n\"This is no fund.\"\nAnd according to the sacred records, it was said that the existence of Heavenly Killing Star needs to be killed as soon as spotted. But Chun Yeowun was interested in him.\n'Damn it!'\nSayogi felt like he had to run away. For the past 90 years, he trained himself to control the urge and he thought he had it under control, but that didn't seem to be the case.\nSomeone had realised that he was the Heavenly Killing Star.\nIt was the.\nShhh!\nWhile he decided to retreat, Chun Yeowun appeared in front of him.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"The Heavenly Killing Star is quite strong.\"\n\"What?\"\nPuck!\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun's fist pierced his chest. The fist seemed like it shook the space.\nCrack!\n\"KUAAAk!\"\nSayogi's body was thrown back and his chest sank in because of the strong blow.\nIn that brief moment, he managed to gather internal energy around the chest to minimise the damage.\n\"Cough… Cough…\"\nThis man was truly astonishing. His chest was sunken in, but it was able to recover.\nCreack!\nThe sunken chest began to protrude out little by little. But the pain didn't go away.\n\"Kuak!\"\nAs he was in pain, Chun Yeowun went behind him.\n\"The recovery is pretty fast.\"\n\"Y-You!\"\nChun Yeowun slammed Sayogi's head with his palm.\nThud!\n\"Kuak!\"\nCrack!\nBlood gushed out of Sayogi's face, and his neck broke.",

      "content": "Chapter 135: Heavenly Killing Star (2)\nThe time when Chun Yeowun entered the Demonic Academy, the institute for training, he had an amazing master.\nIt was Submeng. He was the Right Guardian of the Sky Demon Order.\nSubmeng, who liked Chun Yeowun, accepted him as a disciple without even concerning himself with the Cult's rules.\n[Hehe, my disciple. How is it that you have such amazingly developed muscle, and no one has even selected you?]\nThat was what Submeng said to Chun Yeowun.\nHaving his body treated with Nano to be suited for martial arts, he managed to get the best body, and Submeng had always admired it.\n[It is really strange. Strange! You don't have a special body either, so how do you have such muscles?]\n[Special body? What is that?]\n[Curious? Hehe. Well, there is nothing wrong with knowing it. Occasionally, there are optimal bodies that are made only for learning martial arts.]\n[Optimal body?]\n[Well, actually if we were to classify them in detail, there are a lot but there is no need to know such trivial things. Chuckle, you only need to remember that once in a thousand years, a person comes, who will be born with the body to learn the martial arts.]\n[One in a thousand!]\n[According to a legend, there is a saying that Chun Ma, our founder, was one of those with a heavenly body.]\nThe most excellent body to learn martial arts. Heavenly Body.\nThat body, which can have a superior achievement compared to the others, will come out once in a thousand years.\n[Well, there are other bodies that are also second to none, but most of them have side effects and risks, so it isn't worth knowing about them.]\n[Risk, like?]\n[Well, it is said that some have innate yin or yang excess, but such people don't live past 20 years despite having such amazing energy within them. Having such a body honestly doesn't mean much.]\n[20 years… that is an unfortunate fate.]\nA risk.\nThere is nothing more meaningless than taking risks and becoming stronger.\nWhen Chun Yeowun thought about that, Submeng said something else.\n[Ah! Come to think of it, there is a body form which is comparable to the first one, Heavenly Killing Start.]\n[What is that?]\n[Blood and murderous body that only those born from stars possess.]\n[… sounds like a scam.]\nUnlike the heavenly body, this sounded eerier.\n[I don't know if it even exists. But unlike other bodies, it is said to be the most dangerous kind.]\n[Why dangerous?]\n[It is said that those in this body are destined to kill others for the rest of their lives. It's said that they are born with a killing intent which wants to annihilate everything.]\n[Annihilate everything… That is a crazy word to use. And has this Heavenly Killing Star ever appeared?]\n[I never heard of it. However, the record says that if he appears, he must be killed, not just for the sake of the Murim warriors but also for the sake of people.]\nFor that reason, Chun Yeowun had never thought this Heavenly Killing Star would make an appearance.\n[Master. But how do we know if the person is that one or not?]\n[It is quite easy to find out because of their uniqueness.]\n[… and what if they could be controlled?]\n[Control?]\nSubmeng made a strange expression in response to the question and then smiled.\n[Hehe, the Heavenly Killing Star is said to be able to hide his energy because of his intent to kill. And If he is so trained in hiding it, there is a simple way to find out.]\n[Simple way?]\n[That is…]\nPang!\nBlood gushed out from Sayogi's face. The man staggered and tried to fall down with his neck bent weirdly.\n\"Not yet.\"\nChun Yeowun grabbed him by the collar this time and shoved his feet in his stomach.\nKick!\n\"Kuak!\"\nSayogi was turning pale with the pain of internal injuries. Despite having the power to withstand it and save his organs, Sayogi didn't hold his breath.\n'Strong.'\nLike seeing a demon, it was safe to guess that this man had gone past the humans' normal limits.\nNormally when hurt like this, people would start screaming out and asking to be spared.\nCrack!\nSayogi grunted his teeth.\nThe constant pain only brought more anger. And in order to press down the inherent rage, he always memorized something that his grandpa said.\nThe Heavenly Sutra created by a famous monk which governs the mind.\n'As a calm lake shining in the moonlight, clear the mind… damn it! Damn it!'\nHe was trying to correct his growing anger through the sutra, but the constant pain was hindering him.\nRight now, all he could think about was killing the person ahead of him.\n\"Ahhh!\"\nSayogi shouted out loud. And ran for Chun yeowun.\n\"I will kill you!\"\nMuch faster and more intense than before.\nThe eyes were glowing red.\n'Is he… really a human?'\nHu Bong bit his tongue, this wicked energy felt too odd to belong to a human.\nPapak!\nChun Yeowun managed to stand still, using only one hand to block Sayogi's punches.\n'More! More! More!'\nSayogi's evil intent grew.\nChit!\nThe fists' power was amazing.\n'Is it possible to increase the punches' strength with just raising the evil intent?'\nIt was as if there was no limit to this body. Chun Yeowun, who was using his hand to defend himself, could clearly feel it.\nSayogi shouted enraged,\n\"I will kill you!\"\n\"Isn't that an impossible feat with your abilities?\"\n\"What?\"\nGrab!\nChun Yeowun grabbed Sayogi's face.\nBang!\nSayogi's head was once again hit to the floor. A crack within 5 metres occurred around him.\n\"Oh. Can you handle this?\"\nIt wouldn't bring a concussion, but it could surely turn the man immobile for a second.\nHowever, Sayogi's body was still wriggling.\nGrab!\nChun Yeowun tightened the grip, and then something happened.\n'Energy?'\nWooong!\nA red mist began to spew out, and Chun Yeowun's body was pushed back with the rising energy.\nBang!\nChun Yeowun ended up being pushed back around 10 metres in the air. He then looked at Sayogi with narrowed eyes.\n\"Blood Killing Body.\"\nIt wasn't the muscle.\nIt was to awaken the stage, which can make the flow of blood filled with evil intent.\nThe reason why Chun Yeowun continued to hit the man and enrage him was to see the full and complete form.\nSwosh!\nThe land which was touched by the red mist melted.\nSayogi, who was fully transformed, spread out his arms and the invisible evil intent of blood energy spread like wings.\nHis body floated up, and looking at Chun Yeowun, he said,\n\"I will kill you for sure.\"\nHe spoke in a voice as if he had regained his composure.\nHe looked at Chun Yeowun, at the Murim people and then at Hu Bong.\n\"Everyone will die. All of you will die!\"\nAs if he had been consumed by the karma of life and death.\nAccording to the tradition, the Heavenly Killing Star, who reaches the full form, wouldn't stop killing until everything is annihilated.\n\"I will kill you all!\"\nPhat!\nSayogi flew for Chun Yeowun.\nScared at the evil intent, Hu Bong yelled.\n\"Lord!\"\nHe wouldn't normally worry, but it seemed like this man managed to change into something which he couldn't deal with anymore.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun raised his lips into a smile and held out his sword.\nAt that moment,\n\"Kuak!\"\nSayogi, who was approaching him, suddenly grabbed his heart and stopped.\nA Heart Sword embedded into the heart.\nSting! Sting!\nSayogi trembled and coughed up blood.\nHe tried to push out the Heart Sword.\n\"It would be better if you don't do that.\"\n\"Cough!\"\nAs soon as Chun Yeowun said it, Sayogi gushed out blood again.\n\"The sword I prepared to kill you cannot be taken out with your power.\"\nSwosh!\nChun Yeowun raised his hand upwards, and four black invisible swords appeared.\nWhen he reached out his hand, all four of them rushed for Sayogi with great speed.\nPuck!\n\"Ack!\"\nSayogi's body fell to the floor as the invisible sword stuck to his arms and legs.\nThud!\nUnable to understand, he mumbled.\n\"H-How did you break through the blood po…\"\nHaving felt the pain due to the Heart sword, it seemed like he regained some of his sanity.\nThe armour on the body, a perfect weapon and shield to manipulate.\nAnd the blood points, which were sealed to stop his killing intent, were pierced.\nShh!\nChun Yeowun came ahead of him and said,\n\"You seem to be back to yourself.\"\nSayogi was shocked at those words.\n\"Just what did you… ack!\"\nThe pain in his heart was too much to ignore. The Heart Sword seemed to rip through his heart.\nIf it wasn't for the resilience of the Heavenly Killing Star, the man might have died.\n\"Does your grandfather know that you are the Heavenly Killing Star? And that you turn completely under its control?\"\nSayogi nodded as it felt meaningless to hide it anymore.\n'Other than my grandfather, for such a monster to exist!'\nIt was shocking.\nAfter his grandfather, this man was the first one to make him calm down.\n'Why did I come back? Was it… because of this energy invading my body?'\nHe looked at the black invisible swords in his arms and legs.\nThe ferocious chaotic dark energy flowing around and suppressing it.\nSayogi's red eyes flickered.\n'This new energy is suppressing that intent?'\nSayogi looked at Chun Yeowun. This man was a huge barrier that he could never think of surpassing.\nHe was enraged that he lost to this man even after completely turning into the Heavenly Killing Star.\nSayogi, confessed\n\"Cough… cough… I lost.\"\nSayogi looked down without another word.\nChun Yeowun didn't understand what the man was thinking, and then he continued.\n\"Please take me in as a disciple!\"\n\"Disciple?\"\nChun Yeowun frowned as he never expected the word of a disciple to come out of his mouth.\nUntil a second ago, he was the guy who asked for a duel and wanted to kill him.\n\"Teach me about this sword.\"\nSayogi glanced at the black invisible swords in his arms and legs. He was talking about Sky Demon Energy.\n\"You are seeking instructions from the enemy? You are a funny one.\"\n\"Right now… I know well that I cannot defeat you with my current strength.\"\nChun Yeowun looked at the man who still seemed to want to try and fight him.\n\"You have quite a filthy purpose.\"\n\"I… I will go beyond this!\"\n\"…\"\n\"You know that there is no one who is a match for you. There is nothing more pitiful than a strong man with no opponent.\"\nSayogi said it with serious eyes.\nAt that sincerity, Chun Yeowun chuckled. It was the first time that someone had said such things to him.\n\"I should raise someone with my hands knowing he is aiming for my neck?\"\nAt those words, Sayogi smiled boldly, thinking his words worked.\n\"You will never regret this!\"\nChun Yeowun looked down and smiled.\nAnd then,\nPuck!\n'!?'\nThe Sky Demon Sword was thrust into his chest.\nSayogi put an expression which said he couldn't understand this.\n\"T-take me… as.. a… disciple… of…\"\nChun Yeowun looked down with a cold expression.\n\"You seem to have read too many novels.\"\n\"Cough… cough…\"\n\"Well, don't be too disappointed. Since I am accepting you. As a Ghost.\"\nShhh!\nThe blue-colored energy spread out of the sword and into Sayogi's body.\nLife was quickly sucked out and the body turned white. Looking at that, Chun Yeowun smiled and mumbled.\n\"Blood Killing body and Ghost…a good match.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 136: Heavenly Killing Star (3)\n'M-My body doesn't feel strong…'\nAs his vitality was rapidly drained, Sayogi lost consciousness.\nAnd Chun Yeowun said,\n\"Does anyone other than your grandfather know you are the Heavenly Killing Star?\"\nWhy bother asking such a question to a dying person? Well, It would unconsciously make Sayogi remember people.\nAn old book he read said: It is said to be a sign of apocalypse because Karma is nothing but nature.\nHowever, while the vitality was being sucked. Something unexpected happened\n'What is this?'\nThe blood which had turned stiff and the body which had paled out, were turning back to the original state.\n'The Ghost qi doesn't work?'\nIt seemed like something similar to those demons was happening.\nExcept for their cores, the demons had nothing else in their bodies, so Chun Yeowun's plan didn't make it.\nHowever, Sayogi was a human.\n'Should I stop?'\nStrangely, in the demons, the Ghost qi didn't move inside.\nHowever, it was able to enter Sayogi's body.\nShhhh!\nAt that moment, Sayogi's eyes were back to normal. However, his two eyes which were dyed in red had a blue tinge in them now.\nSeeing how ridiculous it was, Chun Yeowun said,\n\"You can handle ghost qi? You aren't normal.\"\n\"…\"\nSayogi looked at Chun Yeowun without answering.\nHe looked at him blankly, like he had no emotions and something felt rather strange about him.\nThe expression of a god looking at its master.\n'This one.'\nJust to check, Chun Yeowun said,\n\"Rise.\"\nAnd Sayogi got up the moment the words fell.\nHowever, his movements were halted because of the black invisible swords lodged into his arms and legs, so Chun Yeowun removed them.\nShhh!\nSayogi looked at him and got up.\nCarefully watching that, Chun Yeowun exclaimed.\n\"Ha… how could something like this happen?\"\nThe eerie energy of the Ghost qi could be felt from Sayogi.\nOriginally, he had to make this man a ghost, but surprisingly, he was a ghost with a physical body.\n\"Hand.\"\nAt Chun Yeowun's words, Sayogi held out both his hands.\nAnd this time, like he gave orders to Ghosts, Chun Yeowun commanded in his mind.\n'Do some flips.'\nPhat!\nSayogi jumped and turned. It seemed like even when the order wasn't given directly through the mouth, the loyal dog was listening well.\n'Can it unfold in this state? Raise the Blood Kill Body.'\nThe blue eyes turned purple. It was as if his actual killing intent blood mixed with Ghost qi.\nWoong!\nAnd a purple mist began to rise from Sayogi's body. An eerie and creepy killing intent rose at the same time.\n'Take it back.'\nAnd once the command fell, the energy was back to normal.\nPuzzled by this strange phenomenon, Chun Yeowun approached and looked at the pulse to check what had happened.\n'… no way.'\nChun Yeowun who sensed the condition of the body was amazed.\nIn fact, the Ghost qi and the Blood Kill energy were merged and coexisting inside one body.\nAs a result, he was moving under the control of Chun Yeowun, but there was another peculiarity.\n'Doesn't seem to be alive.'\nIt was clear that the body was back to its normal state, but it didn't seem to have any vitality left.\nVitality is said to be a subtle energy in all beings, especially in human beings.\nHowever, Sayogi seemed lifeless.\nShh!\nChun Yeowun put his finger to Sayogi's nose, and didn't feel any breathing.\n'This is really weird.'\nIt was safe to say that two different energies were in one body, making it difficult to determine whether it was alive or dead.\n'The Ghost qi takes away the body's vitality. However, the Blood Kill energy gives life to this one body only, and those two have turned into one.'\nChun Yeowun pondered and finally came to that conclusion. Perhaps that was all.\n'Well, this is interesting.'\nIn the end, unintentionally, he managed to obtain a loyal and faithful slave who was better than a Ghost.\nAnd having a body makes a lot of difference. Ghosts were something he could use normally, but using this human body wouldn't bring any doubts towards him.\n'I am so lucky. Ah!'\nAn idea popped into Chun Yeowun. And as he reached out his hand, a black shadow shook, creating a passage.\n'Go in there.'\nAt that, Sayogi trudged into the shadows. It looked normal, but it wasn't. Chun Yeowun took Hu Bong into the shadows once as a test, and unable to breathe within, he came out after a couple of seconds.\nOn the other hand, Sayogi, who was out of the shadows after a couple of minutes, seemed completely fine.\n'Doesn't breathe, moves with my orders, and can be put into shadows.'\nWhich meant he could call for him whenever needed. Chun Yeowun placed his hand on Sayogi's forehead to confirm one thing.\nAnd everything that Sayogi thought before his death, rushed to Chun Yeowun like a video.\nA thatched place full of books lit by old kind of lamps, an old man with white hair and white beard.\nThe old man dressed in red had a face full of wrinkles, but could stand tall.\n'Hm?'\nThe face in the memories looked similar to Sayogi.\n'His grandfather?'\nThey resembled quite enough to believe that they were related. If this man had grown old, maybe that was how he would look.\nStroking Sayogi's head, the old man mumbled.\n[Sleep well and deep.]\nIt seemed to be the last memory of the old man.\nWhat the man was doing was sealing the points where the Blood Kill energy flowed and stunned the kid. And when Sayogi opened his eyes, no one was in the house.\n[He seems to have pressed on those points again. It is good to get this done in advance.]\nThis was Sayogi speaking.\n[where does grandpa go to each full moon after sealing the blood points?]\nSayogi, who was puzzled, soon laughed.\n[Still, if grandpa is here I wouldn't be able to head out.]\nSayogi hurriedly packed his belongings, and then went to the warehouse to take out the weapons hanging on the wall and an iron box. That had to be the memory of Sayogi coming out of the Death Valley.\n[Why am I here?]\nSuddenly, it was Sayogi's monologue. It seemed like he regretted coming out of Death Valley.\nAnd the memories continued.\nAnother face appeared. A handsome middle-aged man with square face, short hair and beard.\n[Uncle Ark.]\nThis person called Uncle Ark had visited Sayogi's thatched house several times, and they have competed with each other as well. However, Chun Yeowun was shocked.\n'This… the Fist of East God!'\nThe martial arts used by Sayogi was similar to the martial arts of East Challenger God, Ark Wei.\nAt the time when Chun Yeowun was in his own time, he was the best of the Five Great Warriors.\nA man who was in the Changbai Mountains protecting his close friend.\nChun Yeowun assumed that he had no descendants or disciples, but that didn't seem to be the case.\nPhat!\nAnd the memory played till there.\nThe last thing in Sayogi's memories was the figure of the man called Uncle Ark and the feeling of regret.\n'Hmm.'\nChun Yeowun felt like he had to meet the man in person, Sayogi's grandfather. There was a very high chance that he was the one who defeated Hagar. However, it was questionable why such a strong person raised this man in secret.\n\"Lord!\"\nHu Hong's voice came from above.\nChun Yeowun was in a 20 metres hole dug into the ground. It seemed like the fight was done, and he was shocked why his Lord hadn't come out yet.\n\"I am coming.\"\nChun Yeowun, who put Sayogi in the shadow realm, climbed up.\n\"Are you fine? Lord?\"\n\"I am fine.\"\n\"And him?\"\n\"Well taken care of.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nHu Bong had no idea what was being said.\nIn addition, he saw that Bi Mak-heon, Yu So-hwa, Im So-hye and the other members of the Cult were coming to see their vice-chairman.\nHe could see the Murim warriors and the Gate Keepers walking towards them as well, judging that the situation was done.\nThe only person that didn't come was Seo Jang-ryeong. The man got his pride broken and was in huge shock from what he witnessed, so he didn't move to where Chun Yeowun stood.\nWheik!\n\"Woahh!\"\nAll the Murim people cheered and whistled at Chun Yeowun like they were celebrating something, which made Yu So-hwa just shake her head.\n\"Let's be like the vice-chairman of the Yongchun group who has the best name ever!\"\n\"Who thought I would have the chance to greet him?\"\n\"I am very glad to have gotten his opportunity to meet the vice-chairman!\"\nAll the Murim people were anxious to establish contact with Chun Yeowun.\nEver since the prison case, his reputation had risen, and it strengthened a lot after he solved the TRA issue.\nClash!\nChun Yeowun looked at those who were approaching and flashed the head off the dead Alpha Kaiju. Inside it, was a huge brilliantly shining core.\nUnlike the other ones, this didn't have a shell.\nIt was because these dangerous entities which were named as TRA had been on the earth for a long time since their own gates vanished.\n'It is amazing.'\nThis exuding amount of energy had to be called another rank. It was almost three times the energy of an S-class core.\nIf an S-class was known to be difficult to put a price on, then what would be the price for this one.\n'There is too much attention.'\nSwosh!\nChun Yeowun put it into the shadow realm and decided to check it later when there was no one around.\n\"Uh?\"\n\"The energy is gone.\"\nThe Murim people who sensed a vast energy from Chun Yeowun were puzzled at its disappearance.\nIt was the same with Bi Mak-heon who couldn't understand what happened. So Chun Yeowun relayed it to him through telepathy.\n[Mak-heon.]\n\"Ah! My Lord!\"\n[I'll go first, so you take care of the rest and bring everyone back.]\nTake care of the rest meant to handle the Murims and Gate Keepers.\nIt was so they wouldn't develop any bad relationships with people and would make the Sky Demon Order look great.\n[I understand.]\nAs he heard the answer, Chun Yeowun said to Hu Bong.\n\"Hu Bong. You and Mak-heon.\"\n\"I refuse! Lord! I will serve you!\"\nHu Bong didn't want to let go of Chun Yeowun even for a second.\n\"Is that so? Then come and hug me.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nWhen Chun Yeowun opened his arms, Hu Bong's face turned pale.\nThat posture, that posture meant that they were going to fly in the sky, and the pain of moving at Mach speed was too much for him.\nGulp!\nHu Bong gulped, hugged Chun Yeowun, and said very cautiously,\n\"Lord. Hehehe. You know… it isn't bad to fly a little slo…\"\nSwoosh!\nChun Yeowun took off.\nHe immediately went higher with the Nano suit wrapped around him and headed west.\nPapang!\n\"Kuaaaal!\"\nHu Bong's bright scream echoed in the night sky. And the Murims who watched it were stunned.\n\"What was that…\"\n\"People aren't missiles to move that fas…\"\nSichuan Province, Xinlong county.\nA deep mountain valley about 20 km away from Xinlong County.\nIt had a different name now compared to the past.\nIn the past, it was called Bigol, a valley with very rough water flow and once entered, there would be thick forests.\n\"Lord. Is this the place?\"\nHu Bong asked while pointing to a place covered in thick bushes.\nUnlike the other places, a certain place had no grass around.\n'If the place I saw in the memory was right, this had to be it.'\nObviously, looking at the bushes around it, it had to be the place.\nA thatched house had to be there, but he couldn't find one.\n\"Hmm.\"\nChun Yeowun crossed the grassy area and touched the ground.\nDry soil.\n'Feels different from the soils in the bushes.'\nSo just in case, Chun Yeowun waved his hand in the ground. Grey smoke like ashes began to appear.\nHu Bong, who saw that, said,\n\"Lord. It looks like it was burned.\"\nChun Yeowun nodded right away, agreeing to it.\nAs if feeling bad, Hu Bong mumbled that it was unfortunate.\n\"That was why we haven't been able to find any traces.\"\n\"No. This is good. I have something to check.\"\n\"Sorry?\"\n\"get off this ground.\"\n\"Ah, okay!\"\nHu Bong was puzzled but he walked back, and Chun Yeowun stretched out his right hand towards the empty ground and held out the black wrist guard.\nA green light shone out of it. And a circular line was soon formed in the air, which Chun Yeowun swiped to the left.\nWoong!\nThe green light moved around the empty field.\n\"Oh!\"\nIt looked like a stereoscopic image.\nIn that video that showed as if time was running backwards, a pile of dirt was seen, and people in white clothes with shovels and masks were there too.\nEach time they lifted the shovel, a pile of dirt was revealed all covered in ashes.\nThen, the sparks soared from the ground covered in ashes, and the thatched house which had been crumbling was restored back to its original form.",

      "content": "Chapter 137: Oddities (1)\nIt was really strange. As if time was moving backwards in that area.\n\"Oh! My Lord is really wonderful!\"\nHu Bong was mesmerized as he looked at the scene rewinding.\n'It was worth it.'\nThis was the ability Chun Yeowun got from one of the demons he killed at Oshin office. And it was called Time Remind.\nIt had the ability to recall what once happened in a specific location. This ability to reproduce the events in that space in a three-dimensional image for a 24-hour gap was one of the most useful things Chun Yeowun achieved.\nMost of the subordinates of Hagar were low-level demons, so their abilities were rather vague, but Chun Yeowun liked Time Remind.\nSwoosh!\nThe thatched house, which was rewound, had returned to its normal shape. This time, Chun Yeowun turned his hand in the opposite direction for the time to pass, and someone appeared.\n'Sayogi's grandfather.'\nIn the 3d image, an old man with white hair, white beard and dressed in red walked ahead. Hu Bong pointed to the man and asked.\n\"Lord. Is that him?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nThe old man standing ahead of the front door had a strange expression and raised his hand.\nPeople in white robes and masks rushed for the thatched house right away, each of them had a long gun which seemed unusual.\n'Nano, what is that?'\n[No information about the gun.]\nThen, it had to be a new one or a self-made weapon. The masked men in white opened the door and entered the thatched house.\nIt was empty.\nA fat man appeared next to the old man and said.\n[Didn't you say that you sealed the raging blood within him?]\n[I did.]\n[But the GC-000 prototype is gone. Before we could even test.]\nThe old man's forehead wrinkled at the question. At that, the fat man stuttered and hurriedly tried to cover what he said.\n[I had no intention of making you seem uncomfortable. I am just asking because there was no way that you would let that GC-000, which you have been managing for a long time, go missing.]\n[Look.]\nAt the old man's low voice, the fat one responded very soldier-like.\n[Yes.]\nThe old man grabbed the man's neck.\n[Kuak!]\nThe two eyes of the old man, who grabbed the throat, were turning red.\nChun Yeowun looked at it closer.\n'Those eyes are…'\nThe dark red blood-like eyes which Sayogi had when he wanted to slaughter everyone.\nChun Yeowun was in doubt. He couldn't be sure of this since a video wouldn't let him feel the energy, but this old man seemed suspicious for some reason.\n'A Heavenly Killing Star raised another Heavenly Killing Star?'\nIf true, it couldn't be a simple coincidence. The old man spoke.\n[You need to learn to control your mouth.]\n[Kuak, yes… yes. I apologize.]\nThis old man was different from how he seemed in Sayogi's memories.\nIn the memories, this old man is kind and playful. However, not once had he shown such an intimidating feeling.\nTak!\nThe old man let go of the hand and his eyes turned back to normal as he said.\n[In the end, I managed to find the material so I don't need to depend on him anymore.]\n[Cough… cough… but we need to retrieve him. Wouldn't he be a ticking time bomb?]\nAt that, the old man smiled and said.\n[Chuckle, if it is him, he would be dead set on turning the Murim into a mess. He couldn't have gotten far, so look for him.]\nAt those words, the fat man in glasses bit his lip. It was dissatisfying but he didn't try speaking out as he was afraid of this old man.\n[What if the material couldn't be gotten hold of, then the spare would be a waste, are you fine with it?]\n[Don't be silly. I found a way to not move it, what do you plan on doing with such a risk without diagnosis?]\n[…. Alright. That side will fully preserve the power of the elderly.]\nWhile paying attention, Chun Yeowun had a hard time understanding what they were talking about.\nIf Chun Yeowun was like this, could Hu Bong ever get anything into his brain?\nHu Bong just looked at the video and titled his head.\nAt first, he thought that it would be better to watch till the end.\n[I have no reason to stay here anymore, so get rid of everything.]\n[Yes.]\nAfter saying those words, the old man disappeared.\nIt was the place he had lived in with his grandchild for a long time, but he said to get rid of it without a hint of regret. As the old man vanished, the men in white came out with flamethrowers.\nThe man in glasses mumbled.\n[That monstrous old bastard missed the kid? As if I could laugh. He must have let him go because he developed affection after nurturing him for so long. Tch, how dare he!?]\nThe man seemed annoyed and gave orders to burn everything done.\n'Ah!'\nChun Yeowun who watched till then, stopped it and rewinded it back.\nAfter turning it a little back, the figure of the fat man trying to get away stopped.\nWoong!\nWith his two fingers, he tried to enlarge the screen.\nA small logo was engraved on the sunglasses.\n[MS]\nIt was the logo of MS Group. In that brief moment, Chun Yeowun noticed it.\n\"Lord! Isn't that the mark of MS or something? No, those guys that couldn't be found anywhere.\"\n\"Hmm…\"\nChun Yeowun nodded and stroked his chin with his hand. He never expected that this grandfather of Sayogi would be in contact with them.\nAt first, he only thought of finding one clue, and now that he found one, he felt rewinding it back for more, and watched the scene of the thatched house burning.\nThe house was covered with soil over it to hide the ashes.\n'Why is this person affiliated with MS?'\nHe couldn't figure it out. The conversation seemed like there was a purpose behind it. However, it was difficult to understand as they didn't state it out. The only clue was that there was a GC-000 prototype, but he couldn't figure out what that meant.\n'Prototype.'\n[It means a trial with only core functions before commercialization.]\n'Trial?'\nThe man in glasses spoke as if he was handling Sayogi, and what did it mean to retrieve him?\n'If it was Sayogi's words and memories, only his grandfather and that uncle should know he exists…'\nWhich meant that Sayogi was unaware of this fact for many reasons.\nWas it possible that he was deceived all his life? If that was the case, wasn't it the most horrible thing?\n'… should I say it is pitiful?'\nHe died not knowing the truth behind the people around him. Well, maybe it was the best thing.\nAt least he didn't know about the other side of the man he considered his grandfather.\nFlustered, Hu Bong asked.\n\"Lord, what are you going to do? Should we look around for a moment? Maybe someone could pop…\"\n\"Wait.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nChun Yeowun raised his hand, gestured for him to be silent and looked somewhere.\nHis eyes pierced through the forest like a hawk hunting down its prey.\nAbout 400 meters away from there.\nThe top of a tree branch was so high that looking down would make one dizzy.\nTwo forms covered in the shadows of the branches were swaying on it, squatting with their knees bent.\nThe two men were looking at the same place.\nThe man with the hoarse voice on the left opened his mouth.\n\"Ark Young. Why are there two unidentified people in the place you mentioned? Without old man Cho?\"\nThey were looking at Chun Yeowun and Hu Bong in the distance.\nThese people had excellent eyesight. The man called Ark Young shook his head.\n\"Elder Wang. I don't know either. It seems like something had happened to old man Cho. Sayogi, I can't even feel his energy.\"\n\"Is it true that the child was born with a Heavenly Killing Star like the old man said?\"\n\"Right.\"\n\"Ugh, this is getting tough.\"\nThe one called elder Wang spoke to Ark Young in a low voice.\n\"I am sorry. I was too late in accepting your request for help.\"\n\"No. I owed one to the old man, so I came here, prepared to hear what he wanted to say. It looks like we came at a bad timing. What should we do?\"\n\"They seem related. We should catch them and interrogate them…\"\nBefore he could even finish, Elder Wang yelled.\n\"Ark Young. Ahead!\"\nArk Young looked and noticed that the two people ahead of the thatched house weren't there anymore.\nStartle!\nArk Young hurriedly stretched out his fist to the branches which were covered ahead.\nPak!\nA man with red hair appeared through there. Hu Bong.\n\"Why are you hiding there and watching?\"\nHu Bong raised his fist with Fire qi and the two fists collided.\nWheik! Bang!\n\"Kuak!\"\nArk Young's body bounced back, filled with heat.\nIt was the same with Hu Bong.\n'He blocked my fist?'\nThe opponent must have been in a hurry to counter him, yet, he managed to hold his ground.\n\"Ark Young!\"\nPapak!\nThe man called elder Wang jumped out of the shadows and tried to help Ark Young who bounced back. Elder Wang was an old man.\nTak!\nWhen the old man Wang lightly stroked his pal, the fire dug on the body creating the heat was discharged from Ark Young's body.\nWheik!\n\"T-thank you.\"\n\"Such an amazing person. Handling Fire qi. You aren't injured internally, right?\"\n\"I am fine. I just couldn't respond to the flame because I was in haste.\"\n\"Right. However, I hid our presence as much as I could, I really didn't think he would notice. Where is the other…\"\n\"Behind.\"\n'!?'\nElder Wang and Ark Young couldn't hide the shock at the voice which came from behind.\n'Just when?'\nIn the case of Hu Bong, they managed to know the presence a minute before the attack.\nHowever, despite being behind them, they couldn't notice his presence.\n\"You kept an eye over me like a rat.\"\nAn intimidating voice. This man behind seemed like a great warrior.\nPak!\nElder Wang hurriedly checked for injuries on Ark Young and turned back.\nA pale white face, sharp-looking eyes and black suit.\nChun Yeowun.\nAt the same time, Elder Wang brought out his sword.\n'This sword technique?'\nChun Yeowun's eyes lit up.\nWoong!\nElder Wang swiftly aimed for Chun Yeowun's forehead.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun caught it as he pinched it between his fingers.\nPaj!\n\"Catch a sword?\"\nElder Wang's eyes widened in surprise.\nHe was surprised that a man caught a sword unfolding a technique with bare hands.\nThe hand could have been cut if there was sword energy on the sword.\nChun Yeowun asked him.\n\"Old man. The sword technique you…\"\nPhat!\nAt that time, before Chun Yeowun could finish speaking, Elder Wang stretched out his left hand.\nWhile the right hand was being moved, it was not possible to wield a technique with the other.\nThat too a completely different one.\n'Right and Left swords?'\nIt was similar to what Chun Yeowun used to do, use both right and left swords with different techniques.\nHowever, unlike the right one, which had to be dominant, right now, the left was natural and full of energy.\n'This…'\nPak!\n\"No?\"\nElder Wang was flustered. He didn't think this man could block the sudden attack coming in from the left side, which would usually make the opponent fluster.\nChun Yeowun said,\n\"Dual swords. I heard that the All Truth Clan had gone extinct a long time ago.\"\n'!?'\nElder Wang's eyes fluttered at those words. There wasn't a single person in the Murim world who knew of the All Truth clan.\nIt was because the clan hadn't moved forward and went extinct ages ago.\nEven in the time of Chun Yeowun, it was a legendary clan which only stayed in the records. It was natural to be shocked when such a young man could discover that by seeing the sword technique.\n'Who the hell is he? What is the purpose of him being here? Ah? He is…'\nAs he was too worked up, he couldn't recognize him, but seeing up close now, this was a face he had seen several times during the news of judicial prison.\n'Chun Mu-seong the vice-chairman of Yongchun group? Why is there a Demonic Cult member here?'\nChun Yeowun asked.\n\"It doesn't matter what you do. You people. What relationship do you have with the MS Group?\"\nChun Yeowun thought that these people had something to hide as they were hiding in the bushes and watching them.\n\"Are you going to erase us?\"\nAt Chun Yeowun's question, Elder Wang frowned.\nAnd responded.\n\"Young warrior of Demonic Cult. Don't think that since you have recently gained reputation, you could run wildly without knowing how wide the world is.\"\nElder Wang raised the energy. He was a warrior of one hundred and ninety years old.\nAlthough he was shocked by Chun Yeowun, he didn't think he would lose to him.\n\"There are many unknown and oddities about Murim.\"\nWoong!\nAnd he kept raising it. As Chun Yeowun was holding the sword with his hand, it was a battle of internal energy.\n\"Young master, let's have that cheekiness of yours kneel…\"\nTremble!\nElder Wang, who tried to make Chun Yeowun kneel, couldn't hide his shock.\nHis face turned red. It felt like the veins in his arms were about to burst.\n'Ah no, what kind of internal energy…'\nIt wasn't just that.\nCrack!\n\"Ackkkk!\"\nChun Yeowun gave strength and bent the man's finger as he asked.\n\"Who is the oddity? Descendant of the All Truth clan?\"\n\"Kuaaak!\"\n\"Kneel.\"\nTremble! Thud!\n\"Kuak!\"\nElder Wang, who was trying to endure it with all his might, was forced to kneel.\nAnd the floor around him cracked.\nThe knees scraped and blood oozed out. His stomach trembled in pain.\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun was ready to punch.\nPapapak!\n\"Stop! Release Elder Wang right now!\"\nArk Young, who was dealing with Hu Bong, rushed for Elder Wang.\nChun Yeowun, who saw him coming, smiled, lifted his hand and made it into a fist.\nPaaaa!\nThe sound of something breaking.\nThe space where the fist touched seemed like a storm would rage and shape everything.\nThe sight which made Ark Young puzzled.\n'No, that fist?'\nThe fist unfolded by Chun Yeowun was the unification of energy which was used by Ark Wei.",

      "content": "Chapter 138: Oddities (2)\nSichuan’s Ark family.\nA prestigious warrior family that shook the entire Murim world once upon a time. However, at one point, they disappeared from the memory of every single warrior.\nAnd Ark Young was a descendant of the famous Ark family. On the outside, he seemed middle-aged, but he was actually 119 years old.\nWhich meant he lived a long time, but even for him, this was surprising.\nKwakwakwang!\nA part of the forest, which was covered with thick greenery, was blown away.\nIn the midst of the fan-shaped destruction, he stood with crossed arms crossed and ragged clothes.\n“Kuck!”\nBlood came out of his mouth.\n‘I blocked it but…’\nHe couldn’t fully block it. The defense he tried to use was impenetrable, but even that was pierced.\nThe space shook like a raging storm.\nThe unification of energy… the legend…\nIn disbelief, Ark Young said.\n“You… how did you know of the techniques of the Ark family?”\nChun Yeowun responded.\n“For a descendant of the East God, you are so weak.”\n“East God?”\nArk Young’s eyes fluttered.\n‘How did he come to know of that name?’\nAmong the ancestors, there was only one person who had the name of East God and was pretty famous too.\nIt was Ark Wui, the 8th generation member, who was the most prominent and proficient warrior.\nIn the records of the Murim, it was said that Ark Wui, who was famous for a long time as a member of the Five Great Warriors, had one day disappeared.\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun, who held onto Elder Wang’s finger, suddenly appeared ahead.\n“Ach!”\nStartled, Ark Young tried to hit him.\nThe fist made of the essence of energy and 10 level power within.\nIt was a one-shot kill. However,\nPak!\nChun Yeowun grabbed it.\n“Not yet!”\nArk Young’s hand was twisted. The fist he used was the Wind God’s Fist, which should have taken down the opponent at once, but wouldn’t work if the opponent was stronger.\nCrack!\n“Kuaak!”\nArk Young’s arm, which was twisted, soon dislocated and dropped.\n“Stupid too.”\nChun Yeowun seemed disappointed. And that made Ark Young feel absurd.\n‘How can someone who looks so young have such energy?’\nIn general, with body transformation after enlightenment, finding out the age was difficult.\nBut there was one way to guess.\nTooth.\nIn case a tooth was pulled out and the color was checked, one could guess the age, but Chun Yeowun’s teeth were pure white.\n“Chun Mu-seong. What are you…”\nCrack!\n“Ack!”\nThud!\nWhen Chun Yeowun added more power, Ark Young’s knee bent down, and his arm was twisted.\n“I will be the one asking questions.”\n“Kuak.”\n“What is your relationship with the MS Group?”\n“MS?”\nArk Young seemed confused at the question.\n“Pretending not to know?”\n“I have no idea what you are talking about. Isn’t MS Group a company which disappeared a long time ago?”\nThat was what Ark Young remembered. He remembered it to be a company of tech and military development.\nChun Yeoeun looked at that and said,\n‘What is the possibility of a lie?’\n[Considering the changes in the facial muscles, including the pupil contractions, it is less than 5% likely to be a lie.]\nNano’s ability to detect lies.\nIt wasn’t 100% accurate as it was based on science, but it was almost 80-90% accurate.\nChun Yeowun asked.\n“Then why were you wandering around here?”\nAt that, Ark Young responded.\n“That is what I want to ask. The Vice-chairman of Yongchun is… no, Demonic Cult…”\nGrab!\n“Kuak!”\n“Demonic Cult?”\n‘Ah…’\nArk Young, who noticed what he said, changed his words.\n“I-isn't it strange that you, a member of the Sky Demon Order, has come to such a remote place?”\nAt that, Chun Yeowun responded.\n“Heavenly Killing Star.”\n‘!?’\nAt the mention of that, Ark Young went stiff.\n‘How did this person come to know?’\nIt was a secret.\nArk Young’s face, which gave out the hints, tried to cover it.\n“What are you trying to say?”\nSo awkward.\n“You are horrible at lying. You wouldn’t say that Sayogi isn’t the Heavenly Killing star now, right?”\n“You know Sayogi?”\n“I ran into him.”\n“No… you met Sayogi outside this place?”\n“Yes.”\nAt that, Ark Young sighed. He occasionally told Sayogi about the outside Murim world, but he didn’t think he would leave.\nHe just talked about it because he didn’t want the man to feel suffocated in the forest, but it seemed like a lot had happened.\n“Sigh… I must be out of it.”\n‘That happened?’\nHaving seen Sayogi’s memories, Chun Yeowun knew that he walked out willingly.\nChun Yeowun asked.\n“Did you let him go even after knowing he is the Heavenly Killing Star?”\n“Ah! I didn’t! If that was the case, I would have trapped the man here forever.”\n“Forever?”\n“… Sayogi lived for nearly 90 years. He’s old, but he is just a kid who knows nothing.”\nChun Yeowun nodded, agreeing to it. He got that when he battled with the man. Ark Young continued to speak.\n“Mr. Cho and I did our best to help Sayogi overcome the situation. Please don’t misunderstand.”\n“So the problem of Heavenly Killing Star can be overcome?”\nChun Yeowun, who was curious about the Heavenly Killing Star, had looked through ancient books.\nHowever, all of them said that the slaughter couldn’t be stopped as it was simple karma. It was said that the killing was done for the sake of the other living beings.\nAt Chun Yeowun’s question, Ark Young spoke in a loud voice.\n“It can be overcome! Actually, there are cases of overcoming…”\n“Are you talking about the old man? Sayogi’s grandfather.”\n“H-How did you know?”\nArk Young couldn’t hide his shock. He wasn’t sure how far Chun Yeowun knew the truth. So he decided to be upfront.\n“If you know the old man, you must know that Heavenly Killing Star’s Blood Kill energy can be stopped.”\n“Don’t know.”\n“What?”\n“You call that old man Mr. Cho?”\n‘Shit!’\nArk Young realized that the man knew nothing.\nAnd as far as the old man's existence is concerned, even in ‘that place’, not many could know about him.\nUnknowingly he said the name out.\nAs he was shocked, Chun Yeowun asked.\n“Do you really think that old man managed to overcome it?”\n“… what are you trying to say?”\n“Why are you so sure?”\nAt that, Ark Young turned furious.\n“Mr. Cho has never committed an act of killing till now. If that had happened, not just the Murim world, everyone would have been destroyed.”\n“You have a strong belief in him.”\n“I am a witness. Mr. Cho and Sayogi never left this place till now. Occasionally I would come by to bring clothes and other necessities.”\nChun Yeowun looked at Ark Young. It didn’t seem like he was lying, but there was one problem.\n“So close yet you don’t know anything.”\n“What?”\n“Bring that old man and follow me.”\n“?”\nWhere Chun Yeowun pointed was the place where Elder Wang fainted.\n“You should know better that you can’t run away, right?”\nAt those words, Ark Young’s expression darkened. He couldn’t escape while holding an unconscious man in his arms.\nThe red-haired man was also strong.\nChun Yeowun walked to where the thatched house was.\nIt was now empty.\nThey didn’t realize it from a distance, but everything was really gone.\n‘What the hell happened with Mr. Cho?’\nAt Ark Young’s ignorance, Chun Yeowun used the Time Remind power and showed what happened.\nSeeing that, Ark Wui couldn’t hide his shock.\n“This… just how…”\nThese were things he didn’t know. He didn’t know that Mr. Cho interacted with other people.\nHe never expected the man to have a hidden duality within him.\n“Know what they are saying?”\nArk Young shook his head. It was difficult for him to understand what they were talking about.\nWhat was certain was that the old man had Sayogi with him for a purpose and now there was no more need for him.\n“Ah!”\nArk Young suddenly remembered something.\n“What? Did you remember something?”\n“… the problem just turned more severe.”\n“Problem?”\n“Mr. Cho… must not leave this place because of the oath.”\n“Now what is that?”\nArk Young, who wasn’t sure what to do, looked at Chun Yeowun and then said,\n“You might know that Mr. Cho is also a Heavenly Killing Star. He overcame it, but not many believed it. So, in front of everyone, Mr. Cho made an oath to hide himself in Death Valley for the rest of his life.”\n“You said you believed him, now what is this?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s sarcastic question, Ark Young said,\n“What? Just like there are those who trust him like me, there are those who don’t.”\nChun Yeowun asked,\n“You keep saying it, so who else apart from you and h…”\n“Uhhhhh.”\n“Ah! Elder Wang!”\nCoincidentally, Eder Wang, who passed out, woke up. Even though he had an injured arm, Ark Young rushed to the man to check his condition.\n‘Hmm.’\nIf Chun Yeowun’s guess was correct, that person is a descendant of the All Truth clan.\nBut that man didn’t exist in Sayogi’s memories.\n“Why did you bring him? Does he know that Sayogi is the Heavenly Killing Star?”\nWhen Chun Yeowun asked in a tone of doubt, Ark Young responded.\n“Elder Wang was here to help Sayogi.”\n“help?”\n“There is a technique which corrects the raging evil intent in the All Truth clan’s cultivation. He came over to help the man.”\nThat was the purpose Ark Young brought him alone. He felt sorry for Sayogi, who was imprisoned all his life and asked Elder Wang to help the man.\n‘He was the only one who accepted it.’\nArk Young felt grateful for that person.\nChun Yeowun, who looked at the two, commented,\n“That is quite strange.”\n“What?”\n“I am told that he had been imprisoned here for 90 years, but only now the person comes to teach the cultivation method?”\nAt those words, Ark Young turned defensive.\n“It isn’t an easy thing. And the eyes of people in the opposition and Sayogi…”\nTak!\nAt that time, Elder Wang put his hand on Ark Young’s shoulder and said.\n“Ark Young… I am sorry. It wasn’t because I didn’t trust you.”\n“Elder Wang… what are you saying?”\nArk Young couldn’t understand what was being told.\nChun Yeowun shook his head as he spouted,\n“The scent which comes from the old man, can’t you smell it?”\n“Scent?”\nArk Young looked at Elder Wang. He couldn’t smell anything. However, Elder Wang had a perplexed expression.\n‘He is speaking of the Thousand Miles Chase Scent?’\nIt was a tracking scent made in a place called Amhyang, which is known to be a legendary Murim place.\nIt is a scent that can literally track people from thousands of miles away, but it couldn’t be detected by humans.\nOnly those who have taken a special medication can take it.\n“Elder Wang…”\nArk Young suddenly felt something was bad. However, something struck his mind.\n‘This…’\nNumerous martial arts warriors were secretly approaching the place. No matter how much the presence was hidden, the people who were inferior in level could be noticed from a distance.\nApproaching secretly and surrounding the place they were at.\nA siege.\nElder Wang spoke to Chun Yeowun.\n“Cough… Cough… Chun Mu-seong. I don’t know how you sniffed out the scent, but it is too late. At least the strongest elders must have made their way here.”\n“Hmm.”\n“About the disappeared Heavenly Killing Star and all, I am going to tell everything.”\nAt that, Ark Young hurriedly said,\n“Elder Wang, there seems to be some kind of mistake…”\nChun Yeowun interrupted him and said,\n“It seems like he is on the other side. Seeing that three hundred and fifty people came, it seems like they wanted to kill the Heavenly Killing Star.”\n‘!?’\nArk Young and Elder Wang were both shocked.\nUnderstanding the siege was one thing, but pinpointing the exact number of people was impossible. What they were feeling couldn’t be described.\n‘A person with such good sense knew of the siege but didn’t run away, why? Why… no!’\nElder Wang’s eyes widened.\n“Slow. I was getting tired of waiting.”\n“What?”\n“Let’s move on this side first.”\nChun Yeowun moved slightly away from them and held out his right hand. The black wrist guard disassembled and turned into the Sky Demon Sword.\nChachacha!\nChun Yeowun grabbed the sword and pushed it to the ground.\nPuck!\nThey looked to see what he was doing and noticed a blue light from the sword entering the ground.\nChun Yeowun mumbled,\n“Come out.”\nAs soon as the words fell, opaque auras began to rise one after another.\nShrek! Shrek! Shrek!\nGhosts.\n“Huh?”\n“G-ghosts?”\nElder Wang was shocked upon seeing the Ghosts.\n“This… is this….”\nThe appearance of so many ghosts would need another word than terrifying.\nWhen they filled around, a terrifying coldness spread out and Chun Yeowun gave the orders.\n“All of them.”\nShhhh!\nAnd with those short words, the Ghosts scattered all over the place passing through trees and bushes without hesitation. At the terrifying sight, Elder Wang was dumbfounded.\n“How, how can a human summon ghosts?”",

      "content": "Chapter 139: Oddities (3)\nThe horde of countless black people moving fast.\nThree of them were at the forefront.\nAn old man with long grey hair was walking across the valley’s bushes. His eyes were closed.\nOn the other side was a bald old man wearing a tank top showing off his muscles and unsuitable for his age.\nThe other old man with the sunglasses and the fluttering coat was trodding on the branch at a similar speed as the other two.\nThe old man with sunglasses was Yang Hon-cheong.\nHe was the heir to the Yang Sword Emperor clan. He was a person who boasted elegance and had the softest swordsmanship.\n“Elder Cho. Seems like Elder Wang is injured. Huh.”\nAt those words, the muscular older man said,\n“Right. Seeing how his energy suddenly dropped. Ugh, that is why I warned him not to move until we arrived.”\nThe loud voice matched the appearance.\nHe was the 13th generation descendant of Mount Ho, Ho cheol-woo, which was once called as King of Mountains for over 800 years, and had amazing power to wield the two huge axes on his back.\nFor the past hundred and seventy years, he devoted his whole life to learning and managed to attain enlightenment.\nWith a frown, Yang Hon-cheong said,\n“I thought that since he is old, he wouldn’t last long in front of them, but he seems to be fine.”\n“Maybe that Sayogi is a young one. Haha, no matter what anyone says, he’s a Heavenly Killing Star.”\nFor them, a hundred-year-old person was still young. Yang Hon-cheong clicked his tongue.\n“Tch tch. Let’s say goodbye. Two of them, two Heavenly Killing Stars being killed as soon as we arrive. Hhhh.”\nThe old man with long white hair, who didn’t speak much, opened his mouth,\n“Be quiet now. Everyone is coming.”\n“Hmm. I see. Elder Ko.”\n“Hehehe.”\nIt showed that this old man held the highest position of the three. The white-haired man was Ko Ju-ryeong.\nThey were the three Elders, the ones in the highest level. And Ko Ju-ryeong was the strongest.\n‘Hmm.’\nHowever, one thing made him curious. With his senses, he could certainly feel one person’s energy in addition to the two familiar energies.\n‘It can’t be just one person on the other side.’\nThus, he made two assumptions.\nMaybe that old man who had been in that house had become so strong that he couldn’t even feel his energy.\n‘If it is that monstrous old man, everyone will have a hard time. There will be no one who can defeat him.’\nNow, they brought in such a huge force assuming the old man had turned stronger.\nTwo of the four Elders on either side. He himself, a top-three Elder, and another three elders moving in different directions.\nOther than that, there were also elite warriors trained in martial arts under guidance. It was an effort to fight the great monster who had once defeated hundred and eight warriors.\n‘At this level, that old man can be subdued. And then…’\nJo Ju-ryeong touched his closed eye. And then heard the voice from someone behind.\n“Master Go. They came, but I promise you. Please give me a chance to compete with Sayogi first.”\nA confident voice. Ko Ju-ryeong turned his head to see a handsome man with curly hair and grey uniform, who seemed to be in his mid-forties.\n“Hehehe, you. You seem fully committed.”\nHo cheol-woo praised the man.\nThe curly-haired man was called Baek Hyang.\nHe was the next candidate for the head of the Green Forest clan and chosen by the Three Elders. Yang Ho-cheong smiled and answered,\n“Actually, I am more curious about the battle between the Heavenly Body and the Heavenly Killing Star.”\nSurprisingly, Baek Hyang had a Heavenly Body which came once in a thousand years.\nUnlike the high-risk bodies, he had the optimal one to learn martial arts.\n“I will not disappoint the masters!”\n‘He grew up well.’\nKo Ju-ryeong smiled while looking at the confident man.\nHe was the one who found this man. Originally, he wanted to make him his own disciple, but then the man was taught by everyone thinking that he would be the best candidate as the head with the Heavenly Body.\n“Are you confident?”\n“This a battle between two of the heavens which were sent down, I won’t be careless.”\nThe three of them were satisfied with it.\n“Kuahaha, how is he so pretty despite saying such words?”\n“I know.”\nKo Ju-ryeong nodded his head. Anyway, they brought him here to let him gain practical experience as a candidate.\n“Good. Will give you the first chance…”\nCreep\n!\nAt that moment, all three Elders stopped moving at the same time. Baek Hyang too.\n“Master. What is that gloomy energy…”\nA gloomy energy which they hadn’t felt until they stepped into that place. It was growing fast and they couldn’t figure out what it was.\nYang Hon-cheong took off his sunglasses and frowned.\n“Elder Ko. Isn’t that weird energy coming from the Heavenly Killing Star?”\nAt that, Ko Ju-ryeong shook his head.\n“No. That energy is rather… evil.”\nIt was then.\nA scream.\n“Kuaaak!”\nHearing the scream, Ho Cheol-woo urgently said,\n“Seemed like Elder Jo. Let’s go in the scream’s direction.”\n“Ackk!”\nAs soon they thought that, a scream came from another direction.\nKo Ju-ryeong clicked his tongue and complained,\n“Tch Tch, looks like Cho and Sayogi split into two. It seems like they decided that they would be in trouble if we all gathered. He is old too. Such a…”\n“Ack!”\nBefore he could even finish speaking. Another scream came. This time it was in the northwest direction.\nKo Ju-ryong looked at the place, unable to understand.\n“Kuaaak!”\n“Ackk!”\n“W-what is this? Acuk!”\nThe screams kept coming from all directions. And not a single person knew what it was.\nIt wasn’t like they were here to kill the two men, rather it felt like they were trapped within a war.\n“What is all this?”\n“Do you know anything about this?”\nScreams all around meant a huge problem.\nKo Ju-ryeong frowned and mumbled,\n“What the hell are the other Elders doing?”\n“Master! Look over there!”\nAt that moment, Baek Hyang, who was in front of them, pointed to a creepy opaque thing.\nBeings which were coming out from within the trees and bushes.\nGhosts.\n“G-Ghosts!”\n“No. What kind of ghosts would come in broad daylight?”\nAll the warriors couldn’t hide their shock.\nThe Ghosts flew here and there with gloomy energy leaving behind a white haze on the ground.\nEven the Elders who lived for so long, went stiff.\nHowever, Ko Ju-ryeong regained his thoughts.\n“Everyone, calm down! How could Ghosts even exist? It must be some weird thing that old man did! Charge!”\n“Y-yes!”\nAt those words, the warriors rushed towards the Ghosts.\nSurprisingly, these Ghosts knew how to perform martial arts.\n“Huh? A Ghost which knows martial arts?”\n“Isn’t that the Plum Blossom Sword technique of Mount Hua?”\nWhen the Ghosts began to unfold martial arts, people fell into chaos. They had no idea what these were.\nHowever, it was certain that this was caused to trample on their plan.\n“That old man Cho!”\nHo cheol-woo couldn’t hold back his anger. He took the giant axe he was wearing on his back and hit the Ghosts.\nSwish!\nThe axe pierced through the bodies of several Ghosts and came back to him.\nPssss!\nThe Ghosts which were hit disappeared like they didn’t exist.\n“Have you all seen that? They die too! Don’t be afraid!”\n“Oh! Kill them!”\n“We can do it!”\n“Woah!”\nOnce the morale grew, the warriors went for the Ghosts. If it was something that could be killed, then they didn’t have to worry about anything.\nWheik!\nSuddenly, a huge pillar of flame rose from the bushes in a certain direction.\nShocked, Yang Hon-cheong said,\n“That is where Elder Seo and Elder Kang are.”\nElder Seo and Elder Kang were in the top-five Elders.\nThere was something unusual about the pillar of fire that soared. Yang Hon-cheong said to Ko Ju-ryeong,\n“Looks like the old man is over there.”\n“It seems like that group there has failed…”\nGoo…\nThe moment Ko Ju-ryong was speaking, Yang Hon-cheong turned his head.\n“E-eikkk!”\nHe was at a loss for words. It was a Ghost in the form of a giant 30- metre-tall monster.\nEveryone was shocked at the enormous size, which was nothing like a Ghost.\n“What the…”\nAnd when the giant opened the mouth. A blue light beam was shot from it.\nSwosh!\n“A-avoid it!”\n“Ackkkk!”\nKwakwakwakwang!\nThe Elders and the others spread out immediately. The ground was dug in a straight line where the beam passed. What was unusual was that the ground turned white.\n“Ack.”\n“B-body is…’\nThe bodies of the warriors, who couldn’t avoid it, fell down and turned white.\nEven their eyes were white, as if life was sucked out of them.\n“Where did this monster come from!”\nHo cheol-woo bounced up like a spring despite his muscular body and tried to smash the monster with the axes right in the head. The monster’s face was about to be cut down by the energy which extended out.\nRight then.\nPak!\n“Ugh?”\nHo Cheol-woo couldn’t hold his shock. Someone grabbed the two axes he swung with all his might.\nA white face, black suit and sharp-looking eyes. It was Chun Yeowun.\n“Sorry, but that is a bit dangerous. You see, he is a hard-to-find thing.”\n“You, how can you hold sword energy with bare hands?”\nThat was the reason HO Cheol-woo was shocked. This man managed to hold both the axes as if they were nothing.\nJjkkk!\nAnd his sword energy was distorted.\n‘What unbelievable energy.’\nIn other words, just how much internal energy did this young man have to not be bothered by the others?\nFlustered, Yag Hon-cheong shouted,\n“Chun Mu-seong? Demonic Cult?”\nIt was so loud in the news that no one could not know him.\nKo Ju-ryeong, who heard it, was puzzled.\n“Then why is he here?”\nOn the other hand, Baek Hyang liked it.\n‘Is he the most famous Demonic Cult member in the current Murim?’\nBecause their clan never made an outside appearance, they didn’t make a name for themselves, so seeing Chun Yeowun interested him.\nUnable to move the axe, Ho chul-woo shouted in anger.\n“Are you a member of the Demonic Cult?”\nDespite the time changing, he was the head of the Green Forest clan. And it was no exaggeration to say there was a time when they had a connection with the Sky Demon Order.\n“Fine! If you like the axes that much, take it!”\nPung!\nHo Cheol-woo blew the axe into pieces. And the smashed fragments loaded with sword energy flew for Chun Yeowun’s face.\nSwish!\nWhen Chun Yeowun slightly waved his hand, the fragments scattered. Ho Cheol-woo stretched back his fist, gathered energy around it and swung it at Chun Yeowun’s chest.\nWoong!\n“Haaaaa!”\nPak!\n“Ah?”\nHis fist with maximum power was caught, and Chun Yeowun didn’t even move a step back.\n“Pretty rough fist.”\n“This… you?”\n“But you don’t seem to have much of a clue.”\n“What?”\n“You just swing your fist.”\nAs soon as he said those words, Chun Yeowun clenched his fist.\nBiting his lip, Ho cheol-woo began to give more strength into his body. He was confident in his body’s strength.\n“No use. I have go…”\nPak!\n‘!?’\nHo Cheol-woo’s eyes widened as they were about to pop out.\n“What was that?”\nCrack!\n“Kuaaak!”\nChun Yeowun clenched his fist and aimed for the chest which distorted the space.\nAt the same time, the strength which Ho Cheol-woo was so proud of, crumbled in vain and his heart sank in.\nPak! Kwakwakwang!\nHo Cheol-woo was thrown out, broke the ground below and shook his head.\nYang Hon-cheong was at a loss for words when one of the top-three Elders fell down so easily.\n“H-How can this…”\nChun Yeowun was thought to be on the level of Five Great Warriors.\nHowever, the Green Forest clan had abandoned the Murim levelling. They lived past human years and attained pure strength.\nYet, Ho Cheol-woo wasn’t an opponent for the young man.\n‘He is just a member of the Demonic Cult?’\nIf such a person existed, the Demonic Cult would’ve never been defeated by the Murim Association.\nSo as Yang Hon-cheong was wondering who the man was, someone stepped ahead.\n‘Baek Hyang!’\nIt was Baek Hyang.\n‘Him?’\nBaek Hyang’s eyes were twinkling.\nEven after seeing one of his masters fall, he wanted to go and fight.\n“Hyang, stop!”\nPhat!\nBut he already left and moved towards Chun Yeowun with confidence.\n‘Don’t worry. Master Yang. I surpassed you all a long time ago.’\nHe wanted to fight against Chun Yeowun, who is the most famous in current Murim. It was a good chance for him to check his level.\n“It will be different now. Handle my sword! The strongest in the world!”\nBaek Hyang grabbed his sword and struck with lightning-fast movement. The moment to divide the mountains and seas.\nA true level of swordsmanship for which everyone complimented him.\n‘Amazing. When did that child get to that level…’\nYang Hon-cheong’s eyes widened. Baek Hyang seemed to have surpassed the three elders.\nHowever,\nPak!\n“Huh?”\nWith a single hand, Chun Yeowun stopped the sword.\nEveryone thought that the body would be cut with the sword, but he managed to stop it with his bare hands.\nAt his shock, Chun Yeowun ridiculed,\n“Well. Not much of a difference.”\nWith that, Chun Yeowun brought his index finger close to his forehead. At the absurd pose of forehead flick, Baek Hyang yelled,\n“Are you trying to pull my le…”\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun’s finger struck him.\nKwag!\n“Ack!”\nThe pain felt as if a hammer had been used to hit him. Baek Hyang’s body bounced back, but Chun Yeowun, with his swift movements, grabbed the neck.\nCrack!\n“Kuak!”\nThe neck vertebrae was broken because of the force at which the body was about to move and was caught.\nIf not for Chun Yeowun’s hand position, the man could have died.\nHowever, the pain of being hit and grabbed by the throat couldn’t be endured.\n“H-Hyang!”\nKo Ju-ryeong couldn’t help but be shocked.\n‘Such a monster is a mere member, just a member of the Demonic Cult?’\nChun Yeowun was known to the outside world as the Vice-chairman of the Yongchun Group.\nTherefore, they all thought of him as a high-ranking member of an Elder.\nShocked and nervous, Ko Ju-ryeong asked.\n“W-what is your position?”\nWith his voice full of confidence and pride, Chun Yeowun said,\n“Me? Chun Ma of the Great Sky Demon Order.”",

      "content": "Chapter 140: Oddities (4)\n\"Ch-Chun Ma!\"\n\"What?\"\nGo Ju-ryeong and Yang Hon-cheong were shocked at the same time. They were the older generation of Murim who knew better than anyone else what Chun Ma meant.\nWasn't it a title that meant that this man was the most powerful force in the Demonic Cult?\n'No way… there is a 3rd generation Chun Ma in the current Demonic Cult?'\nGo Ju-ryeong looked at Chun Yeowun with trembling eyes. The elders who fought with him had suffered so much. It was their first time seeing such a monster.\n'Ah!'\nGo Ju-ryeong suddenly remembered a conversation he had with his lord.\n[Leader! Why aren't we going out? With the Gate and all, the world is in a mess. Although we have turned our backs on the world, shouldn't we do something in such situations?]\n[Elder. A real disaster will come soon.]\n[Real disaster?]\n[That is more dangerous compared to any other.]\n[Are you saying that we should continue to stock up our strength for that? What could that disaster be?]\n[The prophecy mentioned is coming to an end soon.]\n[Prophecy?]\n[Soon that calamity will appear. A demon that even the sky will fear. We need to prepare for him.]\n[Demon… sky?]\n[The world has enough power to deal with the current crisis. Don't worry. The world isn't as weak as you think.]\nContrary to his concerns, as the Leader of Green Forest, the world regained power and even Murims attained a name for themselves. Although the root cause hadn't been solved, mankind adapted to it.\n'Fall from heaven… demon… Chun Ma. That was it. The disaster that the leader mentioned.'\nHe was convinced that this disaster the leader spoke about was Chun Ma.\nGo Ju-ryeong's eyes turned sharp. When they were here to catch the Heavenly Killing Star, this man appeared.\n[Kill the Heavenly Killing Star. And erase anything related to it.]\nThe order given by the Elder. It was an order to kill the Heavenly Killing Star.\n'The mission has already failed. I'd rather run away somehow and let the leader know that Chun Ma has appeared. If Chun Ma joins hands with the Heavenly Killing Star, a greater disaster would come.'\nIt would turn out to be worse than the worst situation they feared. So Go Ju-ryeong sent a message to Yang Hon-cheong.\n[Elder Yang. I'll stop him. Take the surviving warriors and go back to inform our leader!]\n[Elder Go! What are you…]\n[He has to be the Chun Ma mentioned in the prophecy.]\nAt that, Yang Hon-cheong's expression went stiff. He had forgotten about it as it happened 27 years back, but he remembered the conversation.\n[Ah!]\nAnd Go Ju-ryeong was right. This man had an amount of power they couldn't handle.\nMoreover, seeing that he had the power to control Ghosts, it was even more of a disaster.\n[Wait! Then you alone cannot hold him back.]\nYang Hon-cheong tried to help.\n[You know my ability.]\nGo Ju-ryeong pointed his finger at one of his closed eyes. Which made Yang Hon-cheong bite his lip. Elder Go was trying to show how determined he was to stop the man.\n[I… I must tell you. I will wait for you, Elder Go. I want you to say it with your own mouth, that you stopped the prophecy.]\nWith a nervous face, Go Ju-ryeong smiled.\n[Sigh…]\nShk!\n\"Huh?\"\nEven before the conversation was done, Chun Yeowun appeared in front of Go Ju-ryeong.\n\"Quite an interesting story you were telling. sky fearing something?\"\n'!?'\nGo Ju-ryeong's eyes fluttered.\nIt was supposed to be an energy tone, but was the conversation heard?\n'Who is this person?'\n\"Can you tell me what it means?\"\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun stretched out his hand making Go Ju-ryeong move back.\nPhat!\n'Huh?'\nChun Yeowun frowned. He knew this man was stronger than the one he faced before, but he didn't think he could avoid Chun Yeowun's movements.\nHowever, as soon as he tried to catch the man, he managed to avoid it.\nGo Ju-ryeong, who moved back, yelled.\n\"Everyone out! Hurry up, Elder Yang!\"\nYang Hon-cheong, who was bewildered at the situation, soon took out a stick from his sleeve and lifted it to the sky.\nAnd when pressed, a firework went off in the sky.\nPak!\nA signal to withdraw.\n“Elder Yang, take care! Haah!”\nYang Hon-cheong pulled out the sword he was wearing on the waist and hurled it at Chun Yeowun. It was to stop him from moving.\nShhh!\nAt the same time, Yang Hon-cheong moved away.\nChak!\nChun Yeowun cut down the sword with sword energy, and the split sword flew to the side, cutting down trees until it fell.\n\"You are doing something useless. No one can run away.\"\nChun Yeowun was about to extend his sword at Yang Hon-cheong, but at that moment, Go Ju-ryeong's sword aimed for his forehead.\nShhh!\nInterference in perfect timing. Chun Yeowun tried to cut down this new sword. At that time, Go Ju-ryeong suddenly changed the sword's path from head to thigh.\n'This one?'\nChun Yeowun narrowed his eyes. He clearly saw it.\nRight before he moved his sword, the old man unfolded the sword as if he knew what Chun Yeowun was doing.\n'No…'\nWithout blocking the sword flying to the thigh, Chun Yeowun tried to aim for the throat of Go Ju-ryeong who could come close.\nWith that, he moved his sword.\nPapapak!\nAt that, Go Ju-ryeong quickly spread light footwork and flew back.\nChun Yeowun's eyes shone.\n'Indeed, he knows the future.'\nHe knew of the future before Chun Yeowun moved. He looked to see that the closed eye of the old man was open. A white light gleaming inside the pupil.\n'It works. Even against a monster.'\nGo Ju-ryeong smiled.\nContrary to what he feared, he realized that his ability was working properly. It was harnessed 7 years ago.\nHe woke up suffering from fever for three days and nights and after having pure core elixir, the ability came into existence.\n\"The ability to know the future 3 seconds ahead.\"\nIt might not seem like a huge deal, but it could be said to be the strongest ability against such monsters. Life and death was something that could happen with a single swipe of a sword.\nTo him, this ability was the same as knowing the future 30 minutes ahead.\n'I might even be able to kill him.'\nWith his ability, he could find out the gap in the monster's movement and avoid being hit too, which meant he had a chance to end the bloody prophecy with his two hands.\nSuddenly, he was dyed with confidence.\nChun Yeowun said,\n\"I don't know what you did, but you seem to be pre-reading my actions.\"\nGo Ju-ryeong was shocked. This man guessed his ability roughly in just a few seconds. If the ability was figured out then how to deal with it could be figured out too.\n\"It is of no use…\"\nAt that moment, Go Ju-ryeong's eyes shone as he looked into the future.\nHe could see in his mind what would happen in 3 seconds to help him respond.\n[Kuak!]\nSuddenly his heart was grabbed and he fell. He didn't even know what the attack was.\n'How is that possible?'\nHe had no idea on how to avoid the attack. In that brief moment, it felt like his head was going to explode. Unable to hold back the restlessness which grew in him, he moved to the air.\nPhat!\nAt that moment, something pierced his heart.\nPak!\n\"Ack!\"\nGo Ju-ryeong, who was soaring in great pain, fell to the ground.\nAnd he held his chest as he fell to the ground, just like how he had seen in the vision.\n\"Heart Sword?\"\n\"Ohoho. I guess you weren't stupid.\"\nHeart Sword was embedded in the heart. The Heart Sword, the Sword of the Will couldn't be avoided even if he knew the future.\nUnless he had the ability to run a few hundred meters in an instant.\nGo Ju-ryeong shook his head.\n\"Kua… H-heavenly Master level?\"\nThe legendary sword which can only be used by them. When he found that the level of the monster was something that people dreamed of, he was terrified.\n'H-How can this be stopped?'\nJust a moment ago, he thought he could kill Chun Yeowun, a false illusion. The monster in front of him wasn't something he could even have a chance of standing up to.\n\"Kuak!\"\nIt was a situation where he should feel glad for stopping the monster for a second. All the Elders and warriors must have fled by now.\nA white light shone in his eyes and he saw something again.\n\"W-what is this…\"\nThe future.\nPhat!\nChun Yeowun flew into the air.\nAs he floated up to a high place, he held out his hand and numerous Ice Swords appeared in the air.\nIt was astonishing to see the number of Ice Swords.\n'No way!'\nIt was a sight that was more shocking than the sword lodged in his heart. Each of the Ice Swords was brilliant. And he wasn't the only one seeing it.\n'W-what is that?'\nYang Hon-cheong, who had been working hard to escape, turned his head at the energy he felt from behind.\nOnly to be terrified.\n'I… is this?'\nHe lost his senses. No matter how good the internal energy was, no warrior could handle so many swords.\nOf course, a human couldn't, but Chun Yeowun was different.\nHe had Nano. The best partner.\nBeep beep beep beep!\nChun Yeowun's eyes had augmented reality open within it, numerous X signs locked.\n[Target Lock On. Activate the panel system.]\nWith Nano's voice confirming, the Ice swords moved out at their respective targets.\nSwosh!\nSky Flash.\nChun Yeowun's absolute secret technique hit the fleeing warriors.\nAn empty thatched house.\nThere were people who were unable to move because of the internal energy. It was a descendant of Ark Wui, Ark Young and Elder Wang.\nUnlike Ark Young, who was confused, Elder Wang was hoping to resolve this situation quickly.\n'Control Ghosts… but that ability of Elders isn't that bad either.'\nThe Elders were confident enough to enter the Murim world and never lose face because of their ability.\nThey considered themselves to be on the same level as the Five Great Warriors.\n'Ark Young… I am sorry.'\nHe felt bad for the man. He trusted only to get backstabbed. Still, he tried to defend Elder Wang.\nElder Mak had asked Elder Wang to deal with Ark Young too.\n'He isn't a danger like the Heavenly Killing Star. Ark Young.'\nAll the Elder Wang could hear was the screams and roars from the fight outside. At some point, everything went silent. It seemed like everything ended.\nYet, 30 minutes passed without any news.\n'Why is it this quiet?'\nShhh!\nAt that moment, he heard the sound of something walking.\n'They must be here!'\nSomeone appeared in the bushes, Elder Wang looked to see who it was.\n'No-way…'\nThose who appeared weren't the Elders but Chun Yeowun and Hu Bong.\nAnd in Hu Bong's hand were three hanging people.\n'E-elders…'\nThey were Elder Yang, Elder Ko and Elder Ho. All died in a painful manner. What was unusual was that their faces were discolored.\n'All were hurt?'\nArk Young bit his lip. He couldn't believe that such Elders were taken down.\n\"Okay!\"\nThud!\nHu Bong dropped the bodies down in front of the two men. Elder Wang's eyes turned red in anger.\n\"Release them.\"\n\"Yes. Lord.\"\nAt Chun Yeowun's command, Hu Bong released the sealed blood points.\n\"You! \"\nElder Wang tried to vent his anger at the death of his colleagues, whom he had known for a long time, but Chun Yeowun spoke ahead of him.\n\"How were these people even trying to kill the Heavenly Killing Star with their skills? Descendant of East God.\"\n'!?'\nElder Wang went stiff at those words. He didn't think they would tell Chun Yeowun about his plan.\n'Did the Elders tell him?'\nThey died and even gave information to the enemy. But that wasn't the problem.\nIn a trembling voice, Ark Young asked,\n\"… Elder Wang. Is that… the truth…?\"\nChun Yeowun, who watched that, had a subtle smile.",

      "content": "Chapter 141: Eun Jarim (1)\nThe voice of Ark Young was filled with anger.\nBewildered, Elder Wang shook his head.\n“I-it had to be done. Even Ark Young knows better than this, right?”\nNormally, Ark Young would have been swayed, but he was already betrayed today.\nIf he hadn’t seen the video of Mr. Cho, he would have blindly believed everything.\n‘Ah…’\nArk Young felt confused. It felt like all the people he trusted were betraying him one after another.\nMr. Cho, who he thought was hiding in the mountains, was associated with an unknown organization and was a murderer. It was hard to believe.\n“Would the Elders spill out the truth to him in the fear of death?”\nElder Wang tried to appease Ark Young as he looked at Chun Yeowun and said,\n“Your words… aren’t entirely believable.”\nAt that, Chun Yeowun smiled.\n“There is a place where the four of you were hiding, Kunlun Mountains.”\n“H-How did you know?”\nBoth the men were surprised at it.\n‘They really said that?’\nInformation which couldn’t be known. Of course, Chun Yeowun got this by looking through the Ghost memories.\nEither way, it was a decisive blow.\nElder Wang, who was convinced the cover was blown, decided to plead.\n“I-I was going to let you go. I’ve known you for nearly a hundred years now, can’t you believe me?”\nArk Young’s eyes were filled with disappointment. Human hearts are truly deceitful.\nEven though he believed in Ark Young for years, after knowing that he was involved in killing someone, he turned cold.\n‘How could this be…’\nNothing more could be said. He simply turned away his head.\n“Ark Young!”\nArk Young could have resented the man, but he didn’t. It was said that it was the last courtesy with the man he thought he was friends with.\nEnraged, Elder Wang yelled at Chun Yeowun.\n“You bastard! Trying to divide us…”\nGrab!\n“Um!”\nChun Yeowun grabbed his mouth. Elder Wang couldn’t even resist it.\nChun Yeowun opened his mouth,\n“I already know everything I wanted to know, which means there is no need to keep you alive.”\n“Ump! Ump!”\nChun Yeowun already had all the necessary information from the other three elders. What was strange was that they believed in prophecies.\nA demon, which the sky is afraid of, causes great bloodshed, and was regarded as Chun Ma.\nAnd keeping it alive would cause troubles.\n“Wait!”\nArk Young called out.\n“What?”\n“Please spare him. Don’t commit any pointless murders for what happened because of misunderstandings.”\nIt seemed like Ark Young couldn’t see this man die.\nAt that, Chun Yeowun shook his head.\n“Do you think the orders were to kill you?”\n“Then?”\n“I have been told that they were ordered to dispose of everyone who was related to the Heavenly Killing Star in any place. Is there any reason to keep such a person alive?”\nAt those words, Ark Young looked at Elder Wang. The old man didn’t dare to look at Ark Young.\nThis old man was the one who said nothing should be hidden between them.\n‘Since when did things change?’\nEven just a few decades ago, it didn’t seem like this. At that time, people who turned their backs on the world had strong characters and learned martial arts. An organization that showed extreme movement under the guise of justice.\n‘Was the cause Elder Mak Wei-gang?’\nElder Mak Wei-gang.\n50 years ago, he made a name for himself in Murim and returned.\nAlthough he belonged to the younger generation compared to the Elders, he quickly gained the Elder title. However, he was different from the others. Probably an ideological problem.\nArk Young spoke to Elder Wang in anger.\n“Are you trying to make Blue Sky again?”\n“Blue Sky?”\nHu Bong frowned upon hearing that.\n“My Lord! They seem to be the remnants of that association!”\nAt that, Chun Yeowun stroked his chin.\n“A little mixed.’\n“What?”\n“It seems like the remnants of the Blue Sky Brotherhood are mixed with Eun Jarim.”\n“Eun Jarim!”\nEun Jarim.\nLike the name says, it was a hidden organization.\nThe ‘rim’ was used for the Murim or martial arts warriors, which means hidden group of martial arts warriors.\nAn organization which existed at Chun Yeowun’s time. Normally, it was a secret group made to prevent the Blade God from trying to control the Murim.\nHowever, after the death of Blade God, they became nothing but a group of hiding people.\n“Ah…”\nA sigh escaped from Ark Young’s mouth.\nOf course, he knew that this man could figure out the organization but it was still shocking.\n‘To be mixed with it.’\nUnlike Eun Jarim, the Blue Sky was made up of extremists. It was a faction focused on creating Blue Sky.\nMade up of extremists who wanted to create a world of justice and they wouldn’t hesitate to massacre.\n“At that time, a man named Hoe-jue died in the hands of the Lord, didn’t he?”\nBlue Sky’s Mak Wei-gang. An extremist.\nIt was Chun Yeowun who took care of him. Perhaps, if so, there was a chance that his bloodline had continued till now.\n‘Mak Wei-gang was it?’\nReading Ko Ju-ryeong’s memories, he came to know about Mak Wei-gang’s relatives. Probably the descendant.\nHu Bong shook his head.\n“Terrible people are born.”\nEven at that time, those Blue Sky people always bothered Chun Yeowun with trickery.\nThey were really clever.\nFrom Heavenly Killing Star to the MS Group, and now the traces of Blue Sky.\n“What an impure thing.”\nGrab!\n“Upm!”\nChun Yeowun clenched his hand around Elder Wang's mouth and ripped out his chin.\nTear!\n“Aukk!”\nElder Wang, whose chin was torn off, collapsed with a scream.\nWriggling, he died in shock after suffering. Seeing that, Ark Young turned away his head.\nAs a Murim warrior, he didn’t avoid killing, but it wasn’t easy to watch the death of a man he considered his friend.\n‘Elder Wang…’\nArk Young clenched his fist and spoke to Chun Yeowun.\n“Kill me.”\nHe was the one who asked for death. There was no reason for him to live anymore. After all, he had lived enough and had no attachment left to life.\nHis eyes were calm.\nChun Yeowun looked at him and said,\n“You are similar.”\n“… what do you mean?”\n“East God Ark Wui.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, he frowned.\nHe wondered when they fought, but this man kept talking about his ancestor. Thinking about it, this man even knew how to use their family technique.\n‘Someone related to our Ark family?’\nAs he was puzzled, Chun Yeowun said,\n“He was a true warrior.”\n“… what are you saying?”\nIt was strange, the way he spoke meant he met with Ark Wui.\nAt that time, Chun Yeowun took the pose of Fist of Unification. At that, Ark Young’s eyes fluttered.\n‘This…’\nIt was similar to their clan’s, yet there was a difference in the length and stride.\nAnd Chun Yeowun unfolded it.\nPapapak!\nEvery time Chun Yeowun pushed his arm ahead, a strong wind pressure rose.\nWheiik!\nWhen he drew his hand around, the wind rotated creating dust.\nEach move was their family’s. At that, Ark Young’s eyes had gone wide.\n“No way…”\nIf the Ark family’s technique was complete, was this how it would be like?\nIt was a fist. A technique that has no gaps.\nPerfect execution.\nChun Yeowun exhaled.\n“Phew.”\n“What the hell… what did you do?”\n“Void Fist Martial Arts.”\n“Voice Fist?”\n“It was the technique which was completed with the dedication of Ark Wui.”\n‘!!!’\nArk Young was speechless at it. He heard of this technique.\n‘How… how can he…’\nA technique made by the cultivation of the Ark family as fist martial arts.\nHowever, the technique disappeared and no descendant knew about it. The ancestors made every effort to relearn it, but it was never completed.\nHowever, seeing Chun Yeowun do it, he was shocked.\n“… how did you learn that?”\n“I don’t know… to meet the descendant of Ark Wui like this.”\n“I don’t know what you are talking about…”\n“My debt to him.”\nIf it was not for Ark Wui, Chun Yeowun might not have reached Heavenly Master level. He was the one who taught Chun Yeowun how to cross the wall.\nPang!\n“Ugh!”\nA strong wind pierced through Ark Young. It was the basic form.\n“I will pay that debt now.”\n“?”\n“I’m going to hand over the Void Fist.”\nAs soon as he heard those words, Ark Young felt goosebumps rise over his body. The legendary technique was lost within the family.\nWho would have thought that their own family’s technique was being passed to him by another?\n“Who… are you?”\nAt that, Chun Yeowun smiled.\n“Chun Ma of the Great Sky Demon Order.”\n“Chun Ma!”\nAt those words, he was even more shocked.\n“And I share a small relationship with East God, Ark Wui.”\nIt was also a deep friendship shared on the battlefield of life and death.\nPlaces where the snow-capped mountains were a sight to see. Kunlun Mountain in the west of Qinghai Province.\nThe whole mountain range was covered with snow.\nAccording to the legend, it was said to be the origin of the Yellow River.\nThe mountain had a height of 7,167 meters.\nThe Kunlun Mountains were the highest in the world except for the Himalayas. Also called Mount Song, and many legends existed about it.\nSome say it was the place where a Palace existed and some mentioned there was a place where once every three thousand years a ceremony is held.\nIt was a sacred place for many.\nShhhh!\nThree men were running fast in that place filled with snow. It was Chun Yeowun, Hu Bong and Ark Young.\nThey protected their bodies with energy to avoid freezing to death.\nShhh!\n“Ark Young. How long do we have to go up the mountains?\"\nArk Young, who was leading them, answered Hu Bong’s question.\n“Soon.”\nThe place where they were heading to was the Snow Line which was the holy land of the Eun Jarim.\n“I can feel energy close by.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, Ark Young was shocked. The snow line was protected by a large force of energy which meant that anything inside it couldn’t be felt by the outside people. Yet, Chun Yeowun could.\n“As expected from teacher!”\nArk Young spoke in admiration. It was really fun.\nIn just three days, they had become close.\nWhen he learned that Chun Yeowun was the Chun Ma from a thousand years in the past and had met with his ancestor, Ark Wui, Chun Yeowun said he was open to take Ark Young as his disciple, so he felt great.\nDespite his real age, Ark Young decided to call Chun Yeowun as ‘teacher’. And Chun Yeowun let him do what he wanted.\n“It is here.”\nEventually, they arrived at the entrance of the Snow Line which Ark Young spoke of. Hu Bong frowned.\n“Huh? What is here?”\nIn front of them was a distant cliff.\nIn reality, it was an Ever Changing place, which made it impossible for one to understand it with the naked eye. Ark Young stood and pointed to the cliff.\n“The Ever Changing place in front of the Snow Line blocks entry each time, so if it isn’t entered the right way, we will end up falling into a maze. So follow me.”\nSaying that, Ark Young took a step ahead. And his feet sank.\n“Huh?”\nArk Young pulled back his feet right away and seeing that, Hu Bong said.\n“And someone asked us to follow him.”\nArk Young felt embarrassed.\n“… it seems like the path changed.”\nOtherwise, this wouldn’t have happened. It was said that the person who built the Ever Changing formation was famous. So it was known that this couldn’t be broken, which was why Ark Young was at a little loss of ideas.\nChun Yeowun interfered.\n“Stand back.”\n“Sorry?”\nWhen Ark Young stepped aside, Chun Yeowun stepped ahead. As they wondered what he would do, Chun Yeowun drew out a sword.\nShhhh!\n‘Sword?’\nA sharp energy with eerie feelings and a black line which appeared in the air over the cliff.",

      "content": "Chapter 142: Eun Jarim (2)\nThe blue roof of a tiled house was covered with snow. Above it stood a woman in her mid-30s in a simple blue dress and a middle-aged man in uniform with a stiff face.\nIn front of the tiled house stood an old man with a gray beard and a robe.\n\"Huh! What do you mean by saying I can't meet the Forest Lord? I can't even see the Elders and warriors who have gone out for four days now.\"\nThe old man was Seong Jin-gyu. He was the last descendant of the Martial Sword family and held the post of Elder in Eun Jarim.\nThe woman responded to Elder Seong's without changing her expression.\n\"It is what you heard, Elder Seong. Right now, my father is ill and it is difficult for him to talk, so please go back.\"\nThe woman was Ha Baek-ryeong. She was the only child of the Forest Lord and the head of Eun Jarim\nAlthough she looked like she was in her 30s, she was actually in her late sixties.\nClench!\nElder Seong Jin-gyu clenched his hand and stared at the middle-aged man next to the woman.\n'That bastard! Mak Wei-gang!'\nThe middle-aged man was Mak Wei-gang. He was an elder of the opposition force and the husband of Ha Baek-ryeong.\nIt was like the originality of the stone was being shredded. Ever since this man stepped foot, Snow Line’s Eun Jarim was slowly swaying into his control.\n'I should have never let her meet him.'\nThe men of Eun Jarim felt sorry for this child who spent her entire life in these snowy places and realized that she enjoyed Mak Wei-gang’s company.\nHad they known that this would be the result, they wouldn't have allowed her to meet him.\n\"… It is serious, Miss. Four or more elders can go out only under the permission of the Lord. It isn't something that Elder Mak can decide on his own.\"\nAbout 300 warriors of Eun Jarim had gone out without the Lord’s permission. The fact that Mak Wei-gang dared to give orders to have the Heavenly Killing Star killed without holding a meeting enraged Elder Seong.\nIt wouldn't be strange to deprive this man of the position.\n'And there aren't many people following him!'\nNormally, the line between the extremists and the moderates was quite tight, but at some point, more and more people moved to the extremist side. And two elders of the top three followed Mak Wei-gang.\n80% of the Elders followed him now.\n\"This is a matter that I decided on behalf of my father. Is that such a big deal?\"\nAt Ha Baek-ryeong's words, Elder Seong clicked his tongue.\n'Huh…'\nProtecting that man.\nAt least before this man appeared, Ha Baek-ryeong was clever and sensible, but now she protected the man even if he was wrong.\n'Nothing can be done.'\nHe wanted her to know what was right and wrong, but it couldn't be done anymore.\n\"Nothing can be done. Since he acted as the deputy, now allow me to organize a search party to find the Elders we have lost contact with.\"\nElder Seong asked with a bow.\nIt felt strange to treat this woman who lost her reasoning with respect, but he had to because she was the daughter of the Lord.\nAt one time, when the world was devastated by war, it was this Eun family that had accepted people.\n'Nothing more can be done.'\nMore than three hundred people have disappeared now. More than half of them were extremists, so he thought that people willingly went along with Mak Wei-gang.\nHa Beak-ryang answered with a delay.\n'I can see her eyes moving. I know they are talking with that damn telepathy.'\nDiscussing something.\nAnd then she opened her mouth.\n\"Obviously it makes sense. As a representative of the Lord, I give permission, so how could Elder Seong and Elder Hyang work together?\"\nThe moment he heard that, Elder Seong's face was distorted. Elder Hyang was the leader of the moderate faction. It meant that they were openly trying to keep an eye on this man.\nUnable to contain his anger.\nGrunt!\n\"How can you–\"\nIt was then.\nBefore he could even say anything, a strange phenomenon occurred. The space around them shook and began to crack.\nJjkkk!\n\"What?\"\n\"W-what is this?\"\nThe three of them couldn't hide their shock as they watched it. The entire line was surrounded by a technique and it would look like vast land for people on the outside.\nFortunately, it was in the middle of the mountain, so no one could even come.\n'Is the technique being broken?'\nElder Seong Jin-gyu hurriedly said,\n\"Miss. We need to head towards the entrance of the line right now.\"\nThe defense was located at the entrance. In case the outsider invaded, they could block them.\nHowever, the two people who were surprised with it, didn't even think about moving.\n\"Miss?\"\n\"We will stay and protect this place.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"The lord's condition is critical. How can I move from here?\"\nIt makes sense that she wanted to stay here and protect her father.\n\"Elder Gyeong is guarding it!\"\nGyeong Cheon-guk, the best after the lord.\nEven Mak Wei-gang, who was confident in his intelligence, wouldn't be able to surpass that man.\nAnd unlike those who came in recent times, Gyeong Cheon-guk has been protecting the family since ancient times.\n\"Didn't you hear her? Elder Seong.\"\nElder Mak asked. However, that only enraged the man more.\n\"You bastard! Did you forget that Miss is the only one who can take the role of the Lord?\"\n\"What do you think you say…\"\nShh!\nHa Baek-ryeong raised her hand at Mak Wei-gang, who was getting angry, and then spoke to Elder Seong.\n\"If the enemy attacked right away, isn't it absurd for us to repair the technique right in front of them?\"\n\"That is…\"\nElder Seong was speechless. She was right.\nIf the Lord, who was in critical condition, died now, then the entire thing would be revealed to the world.\n\"Kuak!\"\n\"Go quickly. The lord will be protected by us two.\"\nElder Seong stared at Elder Mak and then turned.\nHe couldn't force them anymore.\nPhat!\nWhen Elder Seong was long gone, with an irritated expression, Ha Baek-ryeong mumbled.\n\"How long are you going to treat me like a child? This is…\"\nThe elegance she had disappeared. Mak Wei-gang hugged her and comforted her.\n\"It is fine. After all, everything will change soon. Don't worry too much, wife.\"\n\"Hubby.\"\nHer expression brightened. She truly loved her husband, and wanted to do anything for him.\n\"We were interrupted, so let's finish what we were doing.\"\nMak Wei-gang said while looking at the entrance of the snow line.\nIf the enemy really invaded, the time of chaos was the best time to do what they aimed for.\nClick!\nThey opened the door to where the Lord was living, which had a musty smell and the smell of flesh rotting.\nIn that dark room, the figure of the Lord was lying in bed.\nBlink! Grind!\nThe Lord opened his eyes and grunted his teeth. His condition was strange.\nStarting with the blue blood vessels, a large part of the skin was rotting. Her father's condition was critical, yet the daughter was looking at him coldly.\nMak Wei-gang approached him and pulled a small bottle with a dropper. He opened it, sucked liquid into the dropper, brought it to the Lord’s eyes, and said,\n\"Now, Lord. Let's continue what we were doing earlier. Please tell me how we can open the chest.\"\nWith that, he dropped the liquid into the wide-opened eyes of the Lord. At that, the man groaned in pain.\n\"Ackkkkk!\"\nHis fists clenched as if he was trying to endure it. Seeing that, Mak Wei-gang mumbled,\n\"The patience of the person who inherited such blood. How long will that last?\"\nHe dropped another drop of the liquid. And the eyes of the Lord began to tremble and his eyes lost focus.\nMak Wei-gang smiled at it.\nMeanwhile, at the entrance of the Snow Line,\n\"Unbelievable.\"\nArk Young couldn't stop being shocked. Chun Yeowun cracked the entire defense technique with one slash from a sword. And then the bridges which connected the cliffs appeared.\n'It is as if he broke the world apart.'\nThe technique used to cover this place was an ancient one and the man who did it was the forefather of Green Forest Lord. It was the first time for it to be broken.\n'That sword just…'\nA sword that destroys anything. Superior Sky Demon Sword.\nSurprisingly, it could even cut through such things. It was the first time Chun Yeowun tried it for such a thing, and it seemed to work.\n\"Hehehe. My lord is amazing!\"\nHu Bong gave him a thumbs up. A gesture he recently learned and enjoyed using.\n\"Let's go.\"\nWhen Chun Yeowun took the lead, Ark Young was out of the dazed state.\nAs they crossed the bridge, the space shook, and the moment they passed it…\n\"Ah!\"\nA new world opened up. The mountain peaks with a flat top were connected by swinging bridges and buildings with tiles.\n'How was such a place hidden?'\nChun Yeowun found it interesting. Until recently, it was hidden, but as he entered, he could feel the strong energy from here and there.\n'Amazing. To hide all this energy.'\nChun Yeowun was a bit skeptical. He thought Ark Young was deceiving him, but that didn't seem to be the case.\nHe wondered who made it.\nSwos!\nAs they crossed the bridge and stepped onto the first peak, numerous soldiers in yellow uniforms flocked in front of them.\nArk Young said,\n\"Teacher. They are warriors of the Eight squad, the entrance line.\"\nEight Squad. The name of the first peakof the Snow Line.\nThe Snow Line consisted of 9 peaks.\nAnd the first was Eight peak, the second was Seventh peak, the third was Sixth peak, the fourth was Fifth peak, the fifth was Fourth peak, the sixth was Third peak, the seventh was Second peak, the eighth was First peak and the ninth was Heavenly Mountain Peak where the Lord resided.\nIf they were normally invited, they could easily enter. Through that, the next peak can be reached and those who reach higher will be given the title of Elder.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun broke into the place.\nAnd eventually.\nRumble!\nSoldiers in yellow uniforms with their weapons surrounded them.\nThey were enemies.\nA middle-aged man.\n\"Entrance Peak leader.\"\nArk Young mumbled. This man was the leader of this peak. He was second to no Elder, yet he remained in his place to help nurture the new people.\n\"Ark Young. What are you doing by bringing in people of the world into our place without the permission of the Lord?\"\nThe people of Eun Jarim called outsiders people of the world.\nArk Young tried to answer it.\nSh!\n\"Teacher?\"\nChun Yeowun stepped ahead and stretched out his hand. The leader was puzzled wondering what he was doing when Chun Yeowun suddenly lowered his hand.\nAnd,\nThud!\n\"Ugh!\"\nHe was brought to his knees by force.\n'Wh-what strength does he possess…'\nUnbelievable energy. But not just him, the hundreds of warriors all were on their knees.\n\"Kuaaak.\"\n\"M-my body…\"\nArk Young couldn't hide his shock. Each of the warriors here were Master level in the outside world. And who could bring them all down to their knees?\nGoo!\nThe energy was making it hard for them to breathe. One by one, people were beginning to lose consciousness.\n\"T-teacher!\"\nSince Ark Young too was an Elder, he was trying to talk to him.\nChun Yeowun said,\n\"What? Were you about to talk?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 143: Eun Jarim (3)\nMak Wei-gang went to the opposite cliff of Heavenly Mountain Peak along with his wife. The Heavenly Mountain Peak was located at the far end of the nice peaks, and was extremely tall.\nMak Wei-gang looked around the place covered in grass.\n‘Red stone… red stone… red stone… found it!’\nA piece of red stone visible through the grass. The first hint.\nMak Wei-gang approached the stone without touching it and looked closely. It was shaped like a triangle with the pointed end pointing to a certain cliff.\n“Hubby! It is that.”\nHa Baek-ryeong pointed to the place which was ten steps away from the cliff.\nWith both feets aligned, he took exactly ten steps ahead, the right foot first.\n[In the front… three times right foot… three candidates… three lefts.]\nHe moved like the Lord said, and so did his wife.\nAfter taking three steps, he took something out of his arms.\nA bottle of water.\nShhh!\nHe poured it to the floor in front of him. And when the water touched the ground, something happened.\nSshhhh!\nThe soil moved and something like a stone slab appeared.\n[Hidden… inside… soil… on top… of stone… arises flame…]\nWheik!\nMak Wei-gang created flame and when it touched the stone slab, it cracked and then opened showing them a stairway leading to a basement.\n“Hubby. The road to the heavenly peak has opened.”\nShe said while leaning on Mak Wei-gang’s back. The stairway would go down, but if they moved this close, they wouldn’t take a couple steps either.\n‘The hidden tenth peak!’\nHis lips twitched.\nThe time invested until the day came. the past fifty years he spent here. In order to obtain ‘it’, which was sealed by an ancestor, he worked tirelessly to gain trust of the lord.\n‘Stubborn old man.’\nHowever, even when the Lord trusted him, he never spoke about the hidden peak. It was his daughter who told him about it.\n‘Stupid bitch’.\nShe fell in love with him and told him everything.\nHowever, even she didn’t know where that hidden peak was. In the end, Mak Wei-gang had to resort to extreme methods and do this.\nHe was worried his wife wouldn’t allow it, but she let him poison her own father as revenge for her dead mother.\n‘What a wretched daughter you rose, Lord.’\nShe was of useful value to him because he needed her to have an official name here.\nWei-gang\nWith a sly smile, Mak wei-gang said to her,\n“Let’s go in, my wife.”\nThe bridge which connects the Fourth to Third peak. There was a person running on it, Elder Seong.\nFollowed by Elder Hyang, the leader of Third Peak.\nThey could fly from one peak to another, but the reason they were using the bridge was because of the climate which was unusual in the place.\nThe moment they tried to fly, they would be dragged down. No matter how great the energy was, it would happen.\nWhat was certain is the movement had to be done on legs.\n‘We must hurry.’\nHe looked at the other peaks with a serious face. A great energy was approaching. And that too at a fast rate.\n‘What are the warriors guarding the other peaks doing?’\nHe couldn’t understand.\nFifty people in the Seventh Peak were Superior Masters, so if they wanted, they could go against this intruder at once and end it.\nThese people weren’t called hidden martial artists for nothing.\nBut what was this feeling?\n“Elder Hyang, we need to hurry.”\n“Alright!”\nElder Seong moved faster to cross the bridge and headed to Fourth Peak.\nIn front of them were two Elders who looked blank.\nGeum(?), I commonly hear Geum but never heard of Guem before, so CMIIW\nGeum... Has to be a typo\n“Elder Guem, Elder Seok!”\n“Elder Seong!”\n“You two. What are you doing here…”\nBefore he could even ask, a loud roar came from the other side.\nKwakwakwang!\n“What is that?”\nThe peak on the other side of the bridge shook. It seemed like a fight was happening and then it stopped. Not long after that, they saw three people walk out.\nChun Yeowun, Hu Bong and Ark Young.\n‘No… why is Elder Ark with them?’\nThe man called Elder Seok couldn’t hide his shock. He knew that Ark Young would also be killed after Heavenly Killing Star was killed by the extremists.\nHowever, he was shocked to see that the man seemed fine.\nOn the other hand, Elder Seong and the remaining ones were shocked by other stuff.\n“He is here in less than 15 minutes?”\nThe fact that they appeared here meant that those who were guarding the other peaks were defeated. There were only three left.\nElder Seong looked at Chun Yeowun.\n‘Is he the one?’\nRemarkably stronger than the other Elders.\nAn unknown intimidation from him. A strength which cannot be measured. It was the first time seeing such a monster.\nElder Hyang spoke first.\n“Wait… isn’t that person the vice-chairman of Yongchun Group who has been a hot topic recently?”\n“Yongchun Group? Demonic Cult?”\nBeing an Eun Jarim didn’t mean living like a monk. They also watch TVs and use phones. And in order to prepare people for the prophecies, they often send people to the world to gather information.\nAt the word ‘Demonic Cult’, the face of Elder Seok, an extremist, went stiff.\nPhat!\n“How dare the members of the Demonic Cult step foot into the holy land of Eun Jarim! I cannot forgive them!”\nPhat!\n“Elder Seok!”\nHe couldn’t be stopped. Elder Seok rushed for Chun Yeowun who was crossing the bridge.\n‘Ark Young. I need to get rid of him before he spills something out.’\nActually, anger about the purity of Eun Jarim was an act.\nWhat he cared for was killing Ark Young. Killing him before he spoke to other Elders about what had happened.\n“Uh, doesn’t seem to have senses.”\nSeeing that, Hu Bong shook his head.\nPerhaps because he was in here all this time, he was proud of his martial arts.\n“Take this! You bastard!”\nChachachacha!\nElder Seok, a master of spears, created spear energy and performed techniques. His skills were different from the past peak’s leaders.\nHowever,\n“That is all.”\nThere wasn’t much power to corner Chun Yeowun.\nChun Yeowun moved through the trajectory without being hit.\n“What?”\nAnd he grabbed Elder Seok’s face.\nGrab!\n“Ump!”\n‘W-what energy is this?’\nElder Seok raised his own energy to shake off the grasp but nothing happened.\nArk Young, who was watching it from behind, was shocked again,\n‘Incredible! Even the four Elders were treated like kids…’\nElder Seok was a spear master of a reputable clan.\nChun Yeowun shook his head and asked Ark Young.\n“Is he an extremist or a moderate?”\nKnowing what he was asking it for, Ark Young answered in a weak voice.\n“… extremist.”\n“Extremist huh… tainted with useless thoughts.”\n“Uhm!”\nShocked by the strength, Elder Seok tried to struggle and get out of the grip.\nAt that, Ark Young spoke.\n“That… teacher. I am close to Elder Seok, can’t you show mercy to him?”\nChun Yeowun laughed and shook his head along with…\nCrack!\n“Kuaaak!”\nCrush!\nHe smashed the face without thinking.\n“Elder Seok!!!”\nThose watching from the other side screamed the name. Ark Young too looked away from the face of the dead Elder.\nChun Yeowun threw the dead body off the cliff.\n“That isn’t the right way to think. Ark Young.”\n“B-But…”\n“Didn’t you say to me? Those who are tainted with the Blue Sky ideology and Mak Wei-gang’s orders are turning people into rotten water?”\n“… right.”\nThe change came 50 years after Mak Wei-gang joined.\nOriginally, the Eun Jarim were prepared to counter the prophecies, but then from one moment, they didn’t seem to be much different from the warriors of the world.\n“Sigh…”\nThe solution was simple.\nAll those who believed the ideology of Mak Wei-gang needed to be killed. It might not be easy to recover, but that is the best way.\n‘Is the teacher's method correct?’\nChun Yeowun’s method was too daring. When he came to the peaks, he was making it a point to kill the extremists.\nMaybe because he didn’t belong here, he was able to decide their fate quickly.\nChun Yeowun said,\n“If you really want to be my disciple, I’ll tell you one thing. If you yourself judged the other one to be wrong in any act, don’t act merciful. You realize that thinking of yours is halting your growth?”\nWith that, Chun Yeowun moved ahead.\nWith the form of an undefeatable man.\nAt that, Ark Young bit his lip and said,\n“I will remember that!”\n“Good.”\n“But, teacher. What about them?”\nHe pointed to the three Elders across the bridge. They were key figures of moderation.\n“Which side?”\nArk Young answered,\n“All moderates.”\n“Is that so? Then leave them alive after making them beg for their lives.”\nWhen Chun Yeowun moved, Ark Young said,\n“They are the leaders of the moderate faction.”\n“Leaders?”\n“They aren’t shaken by the ideology of Blue Sky. Teacher, we can leave them.”\n“Hmm.”\nChun Yeowun nodded.\n“Ah… thank you!”\nChun Yeowun didn’t kill all of them, he only wanted to deal with the evil people in Eun Jarim.\nPhat!\nWorried that Chun Yeowun would change his mind, Ark Young moved to the Elders first.\nDespite being on different sides of the peak, Elder Seong, who witnessed a brutal murder, couldn’t hide his anger.\n“Ark Young! You bastard! What is all this? Are you even sane? Bringing in a Demonic Cult member into the Snow Line?”\n“Elders. Please hold your reins.”\n“What? Are you really saying such things now?”\nElder Seong had no intention of listening to him. He decided that Ark Young sided with the Demonic Cult. At that, Ark Young raised his hands to show that he wasn’t going to harm them and said,\n“I have no intention of fighting. Give me a chance to explain.”\n“Explain? What are…\"\n“Did you know that Elder Mak ordered the squad to kill me too?”\n“What?”\nElder Seong, who was enraged, stopped. This was something he didn’t know.\nFrowning, he asked.\n“What do you mean?”\nAt his question, Ark Young explained everything which happened. When the Elders heard it, they were all shocked.\nEspecially by the fact that Mak Wei-gang had controlled the warriors and Elders too.\nHowever, a more worrisome fact was revealed in the story of Ark Young.\n“The entrance point changed?”\n“Yes!”\nAt that time, Elder Hyang couldn’t understand it.\n“Elder Seong. The entrance can only be changed by the lady and our Lord right?”\nNo one other than those with the blood of the Lord could change the entrance point.\nMoreover, if the change was done without telling the people inside, then those who would leave wouldn’t be able to enter.\n‘Did the miss change it?’\nAll the three elders were shocked. Because they knew what kind of person she was for her husband.\nFeeling betrayed, Elder Seong opened his mouth.\n“Mak Wei-gang! What the hell is that bastard up to!”\nIt was then.\nGrrr!\n‘!’\nThe entire peak shook. But the epicenter wasn’t here, which made all the elders turn their heads.\n“What?”\n“W-what is that peak?”\nWhere they looked, a great mountain peak they had never seen before appeared.\nHeavenly Mountain Peak, where the Lord stayed, was the last peak, but now another peak appeared.\nThat was when someone moved past them.\nShhh!\n‘Uh? Who?’\nArk Young, who saw who moved, called.\n“Teacher?”\nIt was Chun Yeowun and Hu Bong.\nChun Yeowun didn’t bother looking back and said,\n“How long do you plan on talking? Follow me!”\n“Ah! No!”\nThe Elders were dumbfounded. A person from the world was asking them to follow him? But they didn’t have any other choice.\nWoong!\nFrom the new high peak, a mysterious energy was spreading out in all the directions giving out chills.\nFor all they knew, their Lord was already in danger.",

      "content": "Chapter 144: Eun Jarim (4)\n‘Huh!’\nElder Seong, who was chasing after Chun Yeowun, exclaimed. He wanted to chase him and tell him that it was difficult to catch up to him.\nBut that man’s movement was too much for him to even catch up to.\n“Elder Seong. What is that peak?”\nArk Young, who was next to him, asked.\nElder Seong was 230 years old. He was one of the three people who have lived the longest here.\nHe was the one who would know something. However, even that man knew nothing about this new peak.\n“I’ve lived here for over 180 years, but never heard of another peak… ah!”\nSuddenly, Elder Seong frowned.\nHe certainly never heard of a peak.\n‘No!’\nHowever, he did remember the stories which were handed down to the people in here.\nA long time ago, there was a scholar in Kunlun Mountains who sealed something in the peak. Some said it had treasure in it, and some said there was a monster.\n‘Is that the place where they sealed it?’\nIf something important had been sealed, it would have been invisible to others. Elder Seong mumbled in a low voice,\n“I don’t know what exactly, but something must have been sealed by the ancestors.”\n“Sealed by ancestors?”\n“Even I don’t know what it was. However, if measures were taken to prevent it from being seen, it must be dangerous for the world.”\nWoong!\nWeird energy was constantly rushing out from the peak. A chilling energy so great that it overpowered all the peaks. Elder Seong started to be afraid of what was sealed.\n“Whatever it is, we should never let Mak Wei-gang get his hands on it.”\nThe others nodded with a serious expression. Eventually, they reached the final peak.\n‘Right.’\nAs expected, the residence of the 1st Elder was empty at the peak. It was the Lord who asked this Elder to move.\n‘Elder Gyeong has served the Lord for a long time.’\nUnlike the others, they knew that Gyeong Cheon-guk had served the Lord since ancient times.\nHe would know exactly what that mysterious peak was.\nAs they passed through, the residence was revealed.\nChun Yeowun was the first to arrive. There were several buildings in there, and in the centre was the tiled house of the Lord.\nThe feeling of someone residing in it.\nAs they entered through the front gate, they saw the main building with a large yard.\nHu Bong pointed to the room which seemed to be the Lord’s and said,\n“The breath is pretty rough from over…”\nBefore he could finish, a shout was heard.\n“Who would dare to enter the Heavenly Mountain Peak?”\nA voice with energy in it.\nJust seeing that, it was definite that someone was inside.\n“Huh? Is there someone here?”\nHu Bong muttered as he scratched his head.\nEven he couldn’t feel it.\n‘This is the one.’\nUnlike him, Chun Yeowun had sensed this energy the moment he stepped foot onto the Snow Line. The energy which was the most powerful of all in this place. And he felt it move when the new peak soared.\n‘One… on the verge of death.’\nAs Hu Bong said, the breathing was rough and ragged. The exact thing seemed to be known by the other person. Chun Yeowun passed the yard and tried to enter the residence.\nPhat!\nSomething flew through the window of the room. It was an inkstone. A heavy inkstone with energy on it, and Chun Yeowun caught it lightly.\nPak!\n‘Seems pretty good.’\nHis palm, which was holding the inkstone, trembled. It was the aftermath of holding it.\nHe looked at the window where a middle-aged man with thick eyebrows, bewildered eyes and one hand on his back was looking out.\nThis man looked at Chun Yeowun in shock.\nHe seemed surprised that Chun Yeowun caught the inkstone.\n‘He isn’t an ordinary person.’\nThe middle-aged man was Gyeong Cheon-guk. The 1st Elder of Eun Jarim and the most capable man in here.\nAnd since he decided that Chun Yeowun wasn’t ordinary, he immediately called for swords.\nAs he moved, three Invisible Swords appeared in the yard.\nWooong!\n“Hap!”\nThe invisible swords moved towards Chun Yeowun at the same time. Each sword unfolded a different technique.\n“Ah!”\nEven Hu Bong was shocked when he saw it. This level of skill was definitely amazing.\n“My lord, be careful!”\nShoo!\nThe invisible swords aiming for Chun Yeowun came in and were stopped by 12 invisible swords that came from various directions.\nWooong! Clang!\nAs the path was blocked, the techniques being unfolded were also stopped.\n‘How?’\nGyeong Cheon-guk was shocked. The maximum number of invisible swords he could bring was 5. Considering that he couldn’t concentrate fully on the opponent because of the Lord, who was critically ill, this man was a monster.\nTremble!\nHe tried to move the invisible swords, which were blocked, but they didn’t even budge.\nJjjj!\n“Kuaaa.”\nBlack blood flowed from the Lord’s mouth. Gyeong Cheon-guk’s face distorted at that.\n‘What should I do?’\nThe Lord could lose his life if the fight went on. However, it could be more dangerous if the invaders were allowed in. At that moment, Chun Yeowun opened the window wide and entered.\n“You! Come closer and I…”\n“The condition is serious.”\nIgnoring his words, Chun Yeowun walked over and put his hand on the Lord’s neck.\n“No!”\nShh!\nGyeong Chwon-guk tried to stab the man in the heart, but Chun Yeowun caught it without even sparing him a glance.\nPak!\n‘What energy is this?’\n“Don’t try anything funny.”\nCrack!\n“Uk!”\nChun Yeowun broke the blade. Gyeong Cheon-guk, who had his finger broken in the process, was shocked, but Chun Yeowun was touching the pulse of the Lord.\n‘Huh?’\nHe was afraid this man would harm his Lord, but he didn’t.\n“… What are you trying to do?”\n“Poison.”\nIt wasn’t like this middle-aged man wasn’t aware of it. The problem was that even the Lord who knew how to counter the poison was turning weak.\nChun Yeowun said,\n“Remove your hand, your Lord.”\n“What?”\nIf he let go, then the energy he was sending to the Lord to counter the poison would halt, and the man would die. The only reason this man was still alive was because of his faithful subordinate who kept supplying him with energy.\n“What nonsense are you….”\nIt was then that someone rushed inside and said,\n“Elder Gyeong!”\n“Elder Ark?”\nIt was Ark Young. And following him several other Elders entered the room. Looking at the Lord, who was on the bed in a horrible state, they noticed what was happening.\nTheir Lord was dying.\n“L-Lord!”\nGyeong Cheon-guk was shocked at the appearance of the four Elders.\nSo Ark Young explained,\n“Elder Gyeong. We don’t have time, please let sir handle it.”\n“What?”\nThe way Ark Young was treating that other man like an honorary being… Even the Elders didn’t seem to say anything about it, what was their relationship with this new man?\n“He is my teacher.”\n“Teacher? Elder Ark, do you have any idea what you…”\n“This is an urgent situation! Please trust me this once and entrust the Lord to him.”\nArk Young was concerned about the situation. However, he trusted Chun Yeowun who was looking at the Lord's dying state.\nWhen everyone didn’t seem convinced, Ark Young said,\n“My teacher is a Heavenly Master level warrior.”\n‘!?’\nAt that, all the Elders were shocked.\n“He-heavenly Master?”\n“Heavenly Master level?”\nFor a moment, they doubted their ears. They knew that Chun Yeowun was stronger than them, but not this strong.\nThe best warrior of Eun Jarim, Gyeong Cheon-guk, was also shocked. He too thought that Heavenly Master level was legendary.\n‘Is that true? Heavenly Master level?’\nHe thought it was possible since he used 12 Invisible swords. He knew that this man had the strength to overpower him, but it was still a shock.\nChun Yeowun angrily ordered,\n“Don't move.”\nDespite his frown, he removed his hand when he heard that.\n“… Please help our Lord.”\nWith that, he stepped back. Chun Yeowun sat there and placed his palms on the back of the Lord.\nTak!\nIt was to determine how far the poison had spread. While protecting the body from the poison, he observed the inside.\n[Analyzing the toxic substance.]\nNano had already started the analysis.\nChun Yeowun frowned as he kept feeling the poison.\n‘The poison has entered the bone marrow.’\nThe Lord wasn’t in a state that could be easily saved.\nThis man was almost a corpse filled with poison to the rim. It was surprising that he was still alive.\nGrunt!\nElder Seong and others grunted at the sight of their Lord in this meek manner. They didn’t even have the permission to meet him. The 1st Elder, his daughter, and his son-in-law, Mak Wei-gang, were the only ones who could.\n“Did he use poison? That Mak Wei-gang!”\n\"Is this what he has come to?”\nThe Elders couldn’t hide their anger. Unlike them, Gyeong Cheon-guk just bit his lip.\nHe had the same opinion about Mak Wei-gang, but he was ashamed that despite serving the Lord, he hadn't noticed something like this.\n‘But even if it is Mak Wei-gang, would he be able to do this to our Lord?’\nAt the same time, he was skeptical. Despite not being trained in martial arts, the Lord of the Green Forest excelled at tactics, energy, and five spirits.\nWhich meant he would surely have found the abnormalities in his body.\n‘… Is the Miss involved in this?’\nHe couldn’t help but think that this all happened with the help of his daughter. She was the one responsible for the Lord’s meal. Even so, the Lord must have known something.\n‘Lord.’\nHe felt sorry for his Lord.\n“Kuak!”\nAt that moment, the Lord coughed. A dark blue blood touched the floor with a pungent smell.\n“Lord!”\nEveryone was shocked and worried. Chun Yeowun decided that he needed to detoxify the poison and, more importantly, push it out.\nAs the entire room was dark, Chun Yeowun put his hand on the shadow on the floor.\nShhh!\n“Ah?”\nEveryone was shocked. What Chun Yeowun pulled out from the shadows was a glass bottle of 1L.\nHe opened the cap with a swing of his finger and a drop of thick red liquid floated up from the bottle's mouth.\n‘I didn’t think I would use it like this.’\nThe blood of Imoogi. Even one drop should do the task as it was similar to an elixir.\n“What is that?”\nCurious, Elder Seong asked what that was, but Chun Yeowun didn’t answer and dropped the blood into the Lord’s mouth.\nAnd the change occurred.\n“Kuak!”\nThe Lord struggled in pain. Everyone was already on the verge of anxiousness and tried to approach the Lord when Hu Bong stopped them.\n“Wait.”\nInterfering in such things would make things more difficult. The blood of a spirit beast, which was known to be the head of the others, had great power.\nAnd Hu Bong knew better than anyone what the side effects would be.\n‘It has to be that.’\nAs the blood of Imoogi was taken in, Earth qi was activated. Normal people have an aura of five elements within.\nAnd the five are always in balance, but if it is broken by one element, then the condition would worsen.\n‘The Earth qi needs to be suppressed.’\nSince Chun Yeowun was Heavenly Master level, he could handle all five spirits. When he reached out the hand, the energy in nature shook.\n“Ohh!”\nThe elders exclaimed as they witnessed the energy of nature. In the Snow Line, only the water could be accessed, but this man was bringing in the energy from outside this Snow Line.\nWoong!\n“Kuak!”\nThe Lord’s convulsions which had been shaking his body subsided. Fortunately, there were no more problems.\n‘He is a great handler of elements.’\nRather, his body was full of pure energy. The Lord had learned the method to obtain the purest energy. And that was why his body allowed the poison.\n‘Soon.’\nThanks to that, it wasn’t tough to suppress the Earth qi.\nAs the power of Imoogi spread to all the body parts, all five internal organs began to regenerate.\nThey started detoxifying.\nShhh!\nThe pace was fast. The dark blue veins had risen all over the skin and the original color was restored.\nAll the Elders were shocked at it.\n“Oh! Oh!”\n“The Lord complexion?”\nTears flowed from Gyeong Cheon-guk’s eyes.\n‘Lord…’\nIt was strange not to cry if their Lord, who was dying, was revived.\nHe looked at Chun Yeowun.\n‘I should apologize for not believing him.’\nNow that he helped, he decided to apologize for his previous actions.\nIt was then.\nGrrrr!\nThe ground shook as if an earthquake happened, and the tiled houses shook too.\n“W-what is this?”\nMuch stronger than before. The Elders were startled by the roar which came and ran outside to check it, only to be shocked.\nKwang!\n“Huh? The peak?”\nThe sound of the tenth peak which newly appeared.\nThe huge peak was shaking.\nKwang!\nA constant roar from within as if something was trying to get out.\n‘What the hell is happening?’\nIt seemed like they had to go there to know what was happening. However, their Lord wasn’t in the best state to move. Then, they heard someone. Someone staggering back.\n“Miss!”\nIt was Ha Baek-ryeong. She spoke with a frail expression, a face full of bruises.\n“H-help me! My husband is in danger!”",

      "content": "Chapter 145: Great Yokai (1)\n20 minutes ago.\nA dark and cold cave.\nRelying on the lantern he had prepared in advance, he was moving forward.\nIt was the hidden tenth peak. It could only be entered through the Heavenly Mountain Peak.\nAs she entered the cave, Ha Baek-ryeong felt a strange chill on her body.\nBrrr!\nA tremor in her stomach.\nAnd she couldn’t even figure out the reason.\n[Wife, are you alright?]\n[… I am fine.]\nAs her expression wasn’t good, he asked her with a face heightened with panic.\nMak Wei-gang was expecting a treasure inside, and it wasn’t long before they made their way to the innermost part.\n[Wife. Wait!]\n[What is it?]\nMak Wei-gang stepped forward.\nShe didn’t understand why, but he picked up a small stone and threw it ahead.\nPak!\nAt that moment, the stone oxidized and turned into dust in the air.\nLines of red light were created in the air.\n[Huh… a defense technique?]\nWhat stood there was another ordeal. Mak Wei-gang broke in cold sweat, this technique seemed terrifying.\nIt was easy to get seriously injured.\n[Can you remove it?]\n[It won’t be that difficult.]\nAs a woman who shared the blood of the ancestor who created it, she could take it down.\n[However, it was impossible to completely cancel it. It will only be possible if father comes.]\nAlthough she had learned some things, she wasn’t perfect.\nAnd a technique wasn’t something which could be mastered in a short period of time.\nWoong!\nWhen she touched something, red lines floated and then created something like an entrance.\nAt that, Mak Wei-gang smiled.\nIt was for this reason that he made her fall for him.\n[We can move now, my wife.]\nMak Wei-gang touched her lovingly. After walking in, the entrance of the cave, which seemed to be the final point, was revealed.\nThe entrance was blocked by a stone wall.\nRrrr!\nHa Baek-ryeong could feel the tremors stronger than before. She didn’t know what it was in the beginning, but now she understood.\n[The pure energy is shaking around.]\nHer father had the ability to recognize the energies and she had learned that from her father.\nThis pure energy was making these tremors.\n[Husband… I don’t feel good about this.]\n[What do you mean? We came all this way!]\n[There seems to be something dangerous inside.]\nThe trembling of pure energy means that the energy within that cave was bad.\nSomething bad was lurking inside. But despite her warning, the man insisted on opening the stone door.\nAfter she realized that he wouldn’t listen, she decided to open it.\nGrrr!\nAs the heat rushed out, the energy could be felt again.\nThe door opened on both sides. When it opened up in such a strange way, the torch inside the cave lit up by itself.\nWoong!\nThe large cavity inside was enough to fill an entire peak. As they entered that place, the first thing which caught their eyes was the talismans.\n‘My God!’\nSeeing that, Ha Baek-ryeong was shocked. On each talisman were written things for defense.\nShe couldn’t even imagine just how dangerous the inside was.\n‘This is bad. Too dangerous!’\nShe wanted to head out right away, but Mak Wei-gang found something and burst into laughter.\n[Hahaha! I finally found it.]\nHe ran to the center of the cave.\nA rocky pedestal in a strange shape with a 10-meter-tall black stone statue standing there.\n“Sealing!”\nWhat Mak Wei-gang saw was a shiny string of black whip around the statue.\nUnusually, the whip was so long that it wrapped the entire statue.\n[H-Husband! wait]\nBut Mak Wei-gang stopped listening to her. No matter how much she pleaded, it was like the man couldn’t hear her anymore.\nTak!\nHe grabbed the handle of the whip and pulled on it.\nCrrr!\nAt that moment, an amazing thing happened. The whip around the stone statue of the large monster shortened and the whip around the face, which was the last one, was exposed.\nShhhh!\nAnd the beast’s face was revealed.\n‘Fox?’\nMak Wei-gang was standing right ahead of the statue looking at it.\nThe beast had the face of a fox. However, the corner of the fox’s mouth, which was made of black stone, moved.\n[H-Husband! Stop!]\nShe ran and tried to stop her husband, who kept moving close to the statue.\nHowever, at the moment she took a step ahead, the whip moved.\nFortunately, the four legs were still tied.\nWoong!\n[… No.]\nHa Baek-ryeong couldn’t even raise her head in the tremendous energy that was moving.\nA terrifying evil energy was suppressing her from moving ahead.\nClenching her teeth and trying to pull Mak Wei-gang’s wrist.\n[Husband… please! We need to run! Please please!]\nBut he didn’t move.\nFlustered, she looked at him.\n[Huh?]\nHis eyes were tinged in a golden light. This man was completely possessed with this fox’s energy.\n‘Gold?’\nThe moment she saw the gold light, something flashed through her mind.\nShe knew the beast in front of her.\n‘Golden hair…’\nIt was then.\n-An abominable being.\nA creepy voice echoed around.\nPang!\n[Ack!]\nAn unknown force struck her.\nHa Baek-ryeong flew and rolled on the ground. Her innocent beautiful face was covered with blood in an instant.\nThe upper body of this huge being was full of golden hair.\n[Ahhhh.]\nAnd nine tails were moving above the head.\nSeeing that, she ran to escape from the cave without looking back and closing the stone door.\n“Nine tails?”\n“Fox?”\nThe Elders who heard what happened inside that peak were shocked. A creature with nine tails.\nThe nine tailed fox of the legend, Gumiho.\nWho would have imagined that a magical being, a legend, was trapped inside that peak.\nGyeong Cheon-guk asked with a serious voice.\n“Miss. Did you say golden hair?”\n“Y-yes. Brilliant gold.”\n“No…”\nWith trembling eyes, he looked at the peak which was roaring.\n“What is it? Elder Gyeong?”\nArk Young asked.\n“Not a nine-tailed fox.”\n“Huh? Not a nine-tailed fox?”\n“… from the ancient book, there was a monster which is said to have existed in the Yin Dynasty.”\n“Yin?”\nThe Yin Dynasty was very ancient.\n“The great yokai has been called by many names through the centuries. Like Tamamo-no-mae, pale-faced scholar…”\nA being that was once called yokai. And at some point, they turned from calling them yokai to monsters.\nIt was said that the last trace of this monster was defeated by a man in Japan, but it didn’t seem like the information was true.\n“Our Gyeong family stayed with the Ha family for generations. This is why I have heard from my father about the deeds of the ancestors.”\n“Then you…”\n“The ancestors say that this great yokai was trying to shake up the world, so people went to get rid of it. However, I heard that the great yokai had the power of an entire nation of Murim, and so unable to defeat it, they sealed it up. Ha… and it must have been residing in the Kunlun Mountains.”\nIt surprised Gyeong Cheon-guk that the holiest place for them was where that monster was sealed.\nCome to think of it, it might have been the Lord’s mission to monitor this monster.\n“Is it that dangerous of a monster?”\n“Not just dangerous. This golden haired nine tailed fox is one of the Three Yokai.”\nThe ancient book on spirits mentioned 5 Spirit Beasts and 3 Yokai. The Spirit Beasts were said to be born from the sacred nature, but this trio was different.\nEvil beings born from the worst deeds.\n“Haa…”\n“Is this what the Lord talked about? The demon that the skies fear?”\nAll had the same thoughts. At that time, Ha Baek-ryeong yelled.\n“How long are you going to talk? Are you going to let my husband die?”\nAt her words, the Elders felt like they had to do something.\nNot that they were going to save that man, but at least do something to not let the creature walk out.\nElder Seong spoke,\n“Let’s do this. Elder Ark stays with the Lord and so will the lady. Let the rest of us head down there.”\nHe proposed splitting into two.\nHowever, Ha Baek-ryeong objected and said she would follow them, but they didn’t want her down there.\n“I am the only one who can open it up, what could you Elders even do to head in?”\nThey had no choice but to take her.\nEveryone, except for Ark Young, who was the least powerful among the Elders, went to that peak.\nAt the entrance of the sealed place, the Elders looked at the stone door with tensed faces.\nKwang!\nA loud roar from within. The cave shook as if it would collapse the next moment.\nThose who heard it felt pure fear.\n‘Such different energy.’\nEven though the door was closed, they could still feel it. The Elders looked at each other and nodded.\nGyeong Cheon-guk said,\n“Miss, please open the door for us.”\n“Okay.”\nWhen Ha Baek-ryeong put her hand on the stone door, red letters were engraved on it and opened.\nGrrr!\nThe door opened once again revealing the cave, but the shaking stopped.\n“The shaking stopped.”\n“Huh?”\nA musty smell, as if something had burned inside.\nHa Baek-ryeong, who was behind the Elders, covered her mouth.\n‘The talismans…’\nThe talismans covering the wall of the cave were charred and ashes were flying around.\nThe sight was appalling.\nSwish!\nAs Gyeong Cheon-guk waved his hand with energy, the ashes were pushed aside and the site ahead appeared.\nThey saw something in the middle.\nA man with a black appearance, supposedly Mak Wei-gang, was holding something, and in front of him, was a beautiful naked woman with her long hair flowing down.\nThe woman was on the pedestal, and seemed unconscious.\n“What is th…”\n“Let’s get Elder Mak out now…”\nWhen Elder Seong was trying to ask what happened, Ha Baek-ryeong asked them.\nThe Elders went to the place that the lady showed and if her words were correct, then there would be a golden haired nine tailed fox, not a naked woman.\n“Elder Mak?”\nElder Hyang called for him. Looking at how he stood still, it seemed like he wasn’t harmed despite the strangeness.\nThere was no reaction. Puzzled, Elder Hyang approached and put his hand on his shoulder.\n“Elder Mak, are you…”\nIt was then.\nPuk!\n“Kuak!”\nSomething protruded from Elder Hyang’s back.\n“Elder Hyang!”\nWhat came out from the back was none other than Mak Wei-gang’s hand, which was now holding the heart.\n“Uhhhh…. Mak… Mak Wei….”\nElder Hyang, who was attacked, yelled until he fell limp.\nAs the hot blood of the dead Elder flowed on the floor, an astonishing phenomenon occurred.\nWoong!\nOn the floor with the shape of eight trigrams, a red light flashed and then soon died.\nShhh!\nIt didn’t end there. The heart Mak Wei-gang pulled out was presented to the naked woman in a very gentle manner.\n“W-what the hell!”\nThe woman opened her eyes.\nThe bright gold eyes of the woman were pleased.\nAt that moment, the hair turned golden.\nGyeong Cheon-guk mumbled,\n“What! That woman is the golden-haired nine-tailed fox!”\nWoong!\nHe immediately called out invisible swords and tried to attack the woman right away, but something blocked it.\nPapak!\nHuge golden tail.\n‘It could block the sword?’\nThis being called ‘great yokai’ had skills beyond what one could imagine.\nAs he was shocked, something more absurd happened.\nGrrr!\nThe stone door behind was closing.\nElder Seong tried to move to that place, but another golden tail flew in and smacked him away.\n“Euk!”\nThud!\nHe flew to the wall of the cave and blood gushed out of his mouth.\nWith a voice full of fear, Ha Baek-ryeong shouted,\n“Sa-save my husband as promised.”\nAt her words, the golden-haired woman, no, the golden-haired nine-tailed fox, smiled.\n“What was that?”\nHearing that, Gyeong Cheon-guk realized that something was wrong. He thought that she was telling them the truth, but it seemed like there was a deal between them.\n“Misssssss!”\nHe screamed as he looked at her, but she turned her back towards them.\nThud!\nThe stone door completely closed, and the roaring sound started.\nShe muttered to herself in a venomous voice.\n“I did nothing wrong. She needs to be kept alive. If it means saving him, I will do anything.”\nElder Gyeong’s guess was right. She had made a deal with the fox in exchange for her husband and her own well-being.\n-I have been locked up for a long time and need fresh blood. Pay the price and I will spare this person’s and your life too.\nOriginally, she was aiming to control this woman with that captivating energy.\nHowever, that didn’t work because of that woman’s bloodline, so she made a deal.\n‘This is the only way to save him.’\nShe was comforting herself until she heard a voice.\n“What are you doing?”\nShe couldn’t even hear the person approaching because of the roars. She looked back in shock.\n“Who?”\nA man with sharp eyes and a fair face in a black suit. It was Chun Yeowun.\nWhen she came to ask for help, she didn’t enter the Lord’s residence, so she was unaware of his existence.\nChun Yeowun asked again.\n“Why did you close the stone door?”\nConfused, she spoke without realizing.\n“The Elders told me to close it as it was dangerous.”\nShe didn’t need to make excuses as he was someone she didn’t know, but she felt like she had to say something.\nIn a cold voice, Chun Yeowun asked,\n“By the way, what was that scream about keeping your husband alive as promised?”\n‘!?’\nHa Baek-ryeong couldn’t hide her shock. She couldn’t understand how this man heard that.\n“H-How…”\nChun Yeowun looked at the door and said,\n“Open it.”\nIt was a command which made the woman glare at him.\nJudging from the noises, it was clear that the Elders weren’t dead and were fighting that fox.\nThey had to die for the deal to close.\n“… I can’t.”\n“What?”\nChun Yeowun’s brows rose.\nShe felt intimidated by it, but she insisted.\n“If I open the door, my husband will die.”\nShe wasn’t going to open it.\nChun Yeowun asked in a low voice.\n“This is the last time. Open it.”\n‘This!’\nAs Eun Jarim’s successor, she was always treated as the highest force.\nThat’s why she was annoyed at the way Chun Yeowun spoke.\nShe yelled.\n“You! Do you know who I am! I am the only…”\nGrab!\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun grabbed her mouth.\n“Ump!”\nThe grip was so tight that it let her think that her teeth and jaw would break out. As she was flustered, Chun Yeowun spoke in a cold voice.\n“Why do I need to know who you are? I clearly warned you. Open it.”\n‘W-who is he?’\nIt was then that she realized that this person was from the outside, and that he didn’t care about her.\nScared, she tried to say,\n“If you… harm me… I won’t open the door.”\nOnly those of the Lord's bloodline could open it. Using that as an excuse, she tried to make sure he wouldn’t hurt her.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun said,\n“Woman. Did you think I asked you to open the door because I couldn’t?”\n‘What?’\nHa Baek-ryeong couldn’t understand what he was saying.\nSlash!\nChun Yeowun waved his hand towards the stone gate with the sword. A black line appeared on the door and it cracked.\n‘H-How can it happen?’\nAt that, Chun Yeowun spoke in a cold voice.\n“Ark Young asked me to spare you just this once.”\n‘!?’\nBoth her eyes trembled. A great energy was pressing down through her chest.\n“But you let go of the chance so easily.”\nShhh!\nFlustered, she tried to wave her hand and beg.\n“J-just a little….”\nCrack!\nChun Yeowun grabbed her lower jaw and pulled it from her mouth.\nHer jaw was ripped off and her screams in pain sounded strange.\n“Kuaaak!”\n“Shut up.”\nSlash!\nChun Yeowun drew the sword towards the woman this time. As she staggered a little, her head had already fallen to the floor.",

      "content": "Chapter 146: Great Yokai (2)\nThe moment the stone door closed, the great ordeal came for Elder Gyeong and Elder Seong.\nKwakwakwang!\nEach time the golden tail swung, it shattered everything. And the two Elders constantly worked hard to just avoid it.\nIt was the golden-haired Gumiho sitting on the pedestal and biting down the heart of Elder Hyang.\nMunch!\nIt was a terrifying sight to see, but the Gumiho savored the heart with a noble face.\n“So good.”\nThe corners of her mouth rose with satisfaction. The heart of Elder Hyang, who was very strong, had a greater effect on restoring her body.\n“So nice.”\nThe golden-haired Gumiho ate the heart slowly and stood up. The black whip, which was still clasping around the naked woman’s lower body, shone with a red light.\n“How long can this hold me? Huh!”\nShe tapped the whip with her finger and the red letters engraved on it disappeared.\nShhh!\nAs the red letters lost their light, a smile fell on her face.\nAs if relieved, she stood up.\n“Release the whip.”\nMak Wei-gang, who was standing in a dazed manner to the side, pulled the handle, and the whip opened up from the lower body as it was now the length of a normal whip.\nChak!\n“Ahh!”\nThe golden-haired Gumiho’s face was dyed with emotions. After being imprisoned for so many years, when she was finally released, she felt like she had the whole world.\nShe smiled broadly.\n“Hahahahahahaha!”\nShe smiled until she stopped and looked at the whip in Mak Wei-gang’s hands.\n‘Abominable thing!’\nIf it wasn’t for the whip, the divine thing, she wouldn’t have been imprisoned here.\nWhen she reached out her hand, Mak Wei-gang politely handed the whip to her.\nGumiho took its handle with her right hand and the tip in her left.\n‘Let’s break this.’\nShe pulled on the whip with both her hands. A whip which was pulled so much that it felt like it would break.\nBut the whip was still fine.\n‘What?’\nGumiho’s eyebrows rose up at it. Although she had her powers suppressed for long, she was still the great yokai.\n‘Because it is a divine thing? Then let’s break it with my own body.’\nThere was a limit to the power she could draw from her human form. Now that she was freed, she can return to her original form and destroy that divine artifact.\nIt was the moment she was about to turn into her original body.\n‘You monster! Take my sword!’\nShhh!\nAvoiding the tail, Elder Gyeong raised two invisible swords to block and tried to stab her in the back with another.\n“You are pretty good. It must have been quite a while. Someone who can block my tail.”\nWheik!\n“What?”\nElder Gyeong hurriedly tried to move but the tail was faster, it appeared from behind and tried to strike him.\nA little late, he would have taken serious damage.\nPak!\n“Kuak!”\nAnother tail struck him from above. Two more tails slammed into his body at the same time.\nBang!\nElder Gyeong’s body slammed to the ground. A pit of 5 meters was formed.\n“Kuaa.”\nEven though he was protecting his body with internal energy, his insides were shaken.\nHe wanted to stand up and move, but his legs gave out.\nAs he trembled, he heard the voice of the Gumiho.\n“A human heart with that strength must be delicious.”\nShe clicked her tongue.\n“Should I eat you?”\nWithin the pit where Elder Gyeong was slammed into.\nHe lifted his head and looked at the woman who smiled with her tails moving around her.\nWheik!\nA clear sound of whirring, and a huge tail coming down to cut him up.\n“Elder Gyeong move!”\nElder Seong called out, but it was too late.\n‘Ahh…’\nAll the martial arts he learned were of no use in front of this monster. Truly a great yokai. It was then.\nSlash! Pang!\n“Ack!”\nThe scream of the woman.\nElder Gyeong opened his eyes to see her tail curled to the side. It was shocking that the tail wasn’t cut, and he heard.\n“I tried cutting it, quite hard.”\n“You?”\nIt was Chun Yeowun, and he had a huge invisible sword in his hand.\n“Ohhh!”\nAs if angry, Gumiho groaned.\nShe began to emit evil energy which was filling the entire cave.\n‘What kind of energy!’\nElder Seong, who was trying to avoid the tail, turned pale. He, who was a Superior Master, never thought he’d feel fear from this evil energy.\n“I’ll kill you. Human!”\nThree tails went for Chun Yeowun at the same time.\nShhh!\nAll rushing for Chun Yeowun, each hair on the tail was like a needle.\nChun Yeowun raised the sword.\nAnd.\nChachachacha!\nTwelve invisible swords about 10 meters tall arose in an X shape and crushed the tails.\n‘Oh god!’\nElder Gyeong was shocked at it.\nThe invisible sword was literally a sword with amazing energy. It would take great energy to grow the size of a sword, but he couldn’t imagine a person freely making not one, but twelve!\n‘This human… is strong.’\nGumiho's expression changed.\nShe looked down on Chun Yeowun because she couldn’t feel anything from him.\nShe could never be afraid of a powerless man.\nBut this man was different.\n“I’ll deal with you in my true body! Human!”\nGooooo!\nHer body was dyed in a dazzling gold color. The already explosive energy around her rose again.\nWoong!\n“Give me a break.”\nChun Yeowun stretched out the sword towards the woman.\nFlame and Ice Qi surged from the invisible swords.\nA red and pure white beam of light went for her.\nCha! Cha!\nIt was a unification of attributes.\nPachik!\nHowever, it was blocked by the golden energy. Even the unification of energies didn’t pass through her barrier.\n‘This was stopped?’\nWhat worked against an S-class Alpha entity didn’t work on this fox.\n‘This is a great yokai which has existed since ancient times.’\nChun Yeowun heard about this from Ark Young.\nReading the ancient records in his time, Chun Yeowun knew about the Spirit Beasts and the Yokai.\nThe Spirits Beasts are constantly reborn because they come from the energy of nature and then they ascend to heaven.\nOn the other hand, these 3 yokai are born from evil feelings and have been a single being since the beginning.\nThese catastrophes never died and only grew stronger.\n‘This is interesting.’\nChun Yeowun smiled.\nEver since he fell into the future, he couldn’t even remember a time where he had a good fight.\nHe couldn’t even use half of his power ever since he came here, but with this Golden Gumiho, it seemed like he could go all out.\nGoooo!\nThe woman was now into her fox form.\nA giant fox of nearly 20 meters and majestic enough to be called a monster.\nIt was so huge that it filled the entire cave.\n“H-How did something like this exist in…”\nElder Seong was terrified.\nThe energy from the fox made him feel helpless. Even in a human form, the monster looked horrible, but in its true form, it instilled fear in everyone.\nElder Gyeong mumbled with a pale face.\n“The Demon that the skies fear has been awakened like this.”\nThe prophecy the Lord said had come true. But what could they, mere humans, do to stop this terrifying being?\nThey were in utter disbelief.\nShhh!\n“T-this?”\nThere was dark and ferocious energy creeping in from somewhere. It was completely different from the evil energy of the Gumiho.\nIt was closer to the abyss.\n“Demonic energy?”\nElder Gyeong looked at Chun Yeowun in shock. A black haze was rising from his body. The eyes of the Gumiho were looking at him strangely.\nChun Yeowun stretched out his hand and said,\n“This place is too small for a fight.”\nWoong!\nAt that moment, a sword with five lights appeared in the air. It was no ordinary invisible sword.\n‘What is that?’\nFive colors.\nSeveral different energies at the same time.\nA single sword which had the energy of all five qi at the same time.\nWhat made it possible was the Sky Demon Energy which united it.\nPhat!\nChun Yeowun pierced the ceiling. And something amazing happened.\nKwaaang!\nThe entire peak shook. Due to the strong vibrations which spread around, both the Elders lost their balance and held onto the walls.\n“Ahh!”\nEventually the vibration stopped and shocked them again.\nThe cavity, which was dark, was lit up with sunlight now.\nElder Seong mumbled at that absurd thing he witnessed.\n“Oh God… the peak is gone.”\nThe peak had completely disappeared. It was shocking to see the force which seemed like it could even pierce the heavens above.\n‘H-he can stop it!’\nElder Seong’s face brightened with hope.\nHe thought it was the end, but then realized that if it was Chun Yeowun, then that fox could be dealt with.\nWong!\nChun Yeowun floated up and spoke to Gumiho.\n“Let’s do it right now.”\nThe place was too cramped for a proper fight. But something more unexpected happened.\nWooong!\n‘Huh?’\nSuddenly, the Golden Gumiho’s huge body was dyed in golden light once again and the body shrank as it returned to human form.\nNo one could understand why she was doing it, and her human form had golden tears in her eyes.\n‘What is this?’\nChun Yeowun frowned at her and asked.\n“What are you doing?”\nShe burst into tears and flew towards Chun Yeowun while wailing.\n“Lord Chun Ma!!”\n‘!?’",

      "content": "Chapter 147: Great Yokai (3)\nA very long time ago.\nThere were three great yokai which had existed since the beginning of Earth. The three yokai were born from the amalgamation of evil and grew stronger with wickedness and fear of living beings.\nOne of them was the Golden Gumiho. She appeared in the form of a human.\nCompared to the other two, who focused on destruction, she was interested in the existence of humans, and she melted into the society as she enjoyed the chaos within.\nShe would wander into one nation, destroy it, then head to another and do the same.\nIn that process, she made several enemies. Outstanding swordsman, shamans, and samurais.\nEveryone hated her.\nHowever, she was different from normal monsters.\nAs long as she existed, she annihilated all those who challenged her without fear. But one day, the strongest enemy appeared in front of her. For the first time since her birth, she faced a crisis that could’ve killed her.\n-Why… Why aren’t you killing me? I am an evil being who wants you humans to die.\n[Not interested.]\nFunny human. He turned her into a corpse and said he was no longer interested in her. Then why bother fighting her and turn her life this way?\n-You’ll regret it. I will definitely kill you.\n[If you can, do it.]\nIt was an opportunity for her to change, who only thought of humans as entertainment or food.\nThe Golden Gumiho, who recovered her power, visited the human several times and lost many times. But each time she visited him, he would never ignore her and kept dealing with her, and soon she became interested in him.\nFrom his enemy, she turned into the protector of that person. It was so much better to hang out with him than fight him.\nShe wanted to be with him forever until the day he said he was leaving.\n-Why? Don’t you know it is not impossible for you to live forever in this world?\nShe tried to say anything to make him not leave.\n-Don’t go. Please… let’s live together, you and me. A world without you means nothing to me.\n[Forever is…]\nDespite her earnest plea, he disappeared. There were rumours about him leaving or dying, but what was certain was that he didn’t exist in her world anymore.\nAfter ten decades, Gumiho realised that he was no longer in the world.\n-I don’t need this world…\nShe thought that the world was meaningless without him.\nDeciding to annihilate everything and return to nothingness, she reconciled to herself and killed everything she could see.\nUntil that man appeared and imprisoned her in Kunlun Mountains.\nFor many years she vowed.\nIf she could go out, she would kill everything!\nBut something surprising happened.\n‘This darkness.’\nHer heart was pounding. The ferocious yet darkness felt from this man was the same as the man in the past.\nAlthough the appearance had changed, she would never forget it.\n“Lord Chun Ma!!!”\nThe Golden Gumiho with her broken heart tried to embrace Chun Yeowun.\nUnable to understand her intentions, Chun Yeowun held out his hand and a huge invisible sword blocked her like a wall.\n“Chun Ma! Me! It is me!”\n“What are you saying?”\n“Don’t know me?”\nGumiho kept asking by pointing to herself, but Chun Yeowun couldn’t figure out what she was talking about.\nBut the word Chun Ma which came out of her mouth made him stay alert. Who could have thought that the name Chun Ma would come out from the yokai which was imprisoned in this place?\n“Golden Gumiho. Have you ever met my ancestor?”\n“Ancestor?”\nShe, who was acting all ferocious till a second back was looking at him with her eyes wide open.\nChun Yeowun, who realised she knew nothing, said,\n“I am the 2nd Chun Ma. Chun Yeowun.”\n“2nd Chun Ma?”\n“The person you are talking about seems to be the 1st Chun Ma, my ancestor right?”\nThe woman spoke as if she couldn’t understand.\n“What are you saying? This energy is unmistakably Chun Ma! You are him!”\n“Are you talking about Sky Demon Energy?”\n“Sky Demon Energy?”\n“This is the energy I received from my ancestor.”\nChun Yeowun obtained the energy from the Sky Demon Sword which was in the Demonic Cult’s library. And now the energy was united in him.\nElder Gyeong who heard that conversation frowned.\n“Chun Ma?”\nSo was Elder Seong.\nUnlike Elder Gyeong, who only cared for the Lord, he knew other stuff.\n‘2nd Chun Ma? Chun Yeowun?’\nHe doubted his ears for a moment.\nThe man was the vice-chairman of Yongchun Group, and a Demonic Cult member.\nWhat was this 2nd Chun Ma stuff now?\n‘Demon God Chun Yeowun!’\nThere was no way someone who tries to be a great martial artist wouldn’t know that name.\nThe name of one of the few warriors who were called as the strongest in the history of Murim.\nElder Seong looked at Chun Yeowun with trembling eyes, who was still talking with the woman.\n‘No. how can anyone other than Chun Ma withstand that energy?’\nShe didn’t admit it. The Sky Demon Energy from Chun Yeowun was more dangerous than her energy.\n“Liar!”\n“… sigh.”\nChun Yeowun sighed.\nBoth men were different looking, so he couldn’t understand why this fox wouldn’t believe him.\nThe woman had a grasp on the energy as she too was someone who has lived for a long time.\n“You think I won’t notice your energy?”\n“Please stop now. It was my ancestor you had met.”\nHe didn’t want to deal with her anymore, but it wasn’t the same for Gumiho.\nSo in a cold voice, she spoke to Chun Yeowun.\n“You really want to act like you don’t know me?”\n“I said it was my ancestor.”\n“Really, are you going to keep saying that?”\nWooong!\nAs soon as she said that, her body shone in golden light again with nine huge tails.\n-If you aren’t Chun Ma, you can’t stop me!\nGumiho said.\nAt that moment, tremendous energy was concentrated around her and soon created a golden sphere which was shot like a beam to the sky.\nChak! Kwakwakwang!\nAs it was released, it erupted causing storms of wind in all the directions.\nLike a laser canon.\nChun Yeowun grabbed the sword, and once again, the invisible sword with the five qi was formed.\nChak!\nChun Yeowun swung his sword towards the beam.\nThe beam of light which was flying to destroy everything was split in half and hit the peak of Heavenly Mountain Peak.\nKwakwakwang!\nAs a part of the peak was damaged, it shook.\nElder Gyeong, who watched that, was at a loss for words.\nThe attack of that woman and the man who managed to cut it.\n‘I made a mistake.’\nChun Yeowun frowned as he looked at the swaying peak. In that peak were Ark Young, Hu Bong and the Lord.\nAt that moment, huge tails came from both sides of Chun Yeowun as if clapping with both hands.\nSh!\nChun Yeowun held the sword with his left hand. Then, another huge sword was born with an amalgamation of five qi.\nWhoong!\nChun Yeowun blocked both the tails with two swords of five qi. There was a tremendous amount of pressure from the fox.\nKwakwakwang!\nThe pressure was so strong that this peak, which had its top blown off, was still shaking.\nGrrrr!\n“Euk!”\n“W-what the hell!”\nBoth Elders were pushed to the ground. Despite trying to resist it, they couldn’t do much in front of the monstrous energy.\n‘A confrontation between a yokai and a Heavenly Master? Both which were thought to be legends?’\nA battle of transcendental beings. They could see the damage these two beings could do.\nKwan!\nThe Golden Gumiho opened its mouth as it caught Chun Yeowun between its two tails.\nAn energy sphere was being made ready to fire at him.\n“It is dangerous!”\nElder Gyeong shouted.\nHaving pulled out two swords made of 5 qi meant that he was doing his best, which meant Chun Yeowun could no longer do anything.\nHowever.\nChachachacha!\nA beam of light pierced through the air.\nAt that, Chun Yeowun held out the hand which was holding the sword.\nJjkkkk!\nThe space in front of Chun Yeowun immediately twisted like a whirlwind.\nAnd a huge black hole was created into which that beam was sucked.\nSwoosh!\n‘That?’\nThe fox’s eyes fluttered. The Chun Ma she knew was only able to block things with the one sword he had, she never knew that her attack could be stopped this way.\n‘Then how about this?’\nThe fox jumped.\nThud! Kwang!\n“Huk!”\n“This!”\nAs she jumped, the peak shook and the Elders moved away to avoid being hit by the rocks which bounced up at the fox’s movements.\nPapapak!\nThousands of golden hairs on the fox stood up and moved for Chun Yeowun.\nSwoosh!\nA single hair couldn’t be blocked by the Elders, but now, a thousand of them were coming for one man.\n“I-is that the Golden Gumiho?”\nAs the fight was too destructive, Ark Young, who came out of the residence, asked.\nHe saw Chun Yeowun in the air, and numerous golden thorns-like things going for him.\n‘That is?’\nHe wondered if his teacher could stop it, but Chun Yeowun moved his invisible sword of five qi into the air.\nWhoop!\nAt that moment, the sword which was mid air and flying slowly, crumpled and vanished.\nAt that, Chun Yeowun smiled,\n‘It is the first time I am using it since I looked into the universe.’\nPapahahahak!\nSomething unbelievable happened.\nIn the twisted space, a tremendous amount of energy came out and formed into a tornado, which swept away the golden needles aiming for Chun Yeowun.\n‘Is this the power of a Heavenly Master?’\nElder Gyeong was at a loss for words. He learned of the power a warrior in Heavenly Master level has, but this was too much.\n‘Is this Chun Ma?’\nEven the fox frowned. The power this man was using was nothing like the power her Chun Ma used.\nChun Ma used demonic power, but this man, the power he was using was difficult to understand despite knowing it was close to chaos.\nChun Yeowun spoke to the Golden Gumiho.\n“If you dealt with ancestor, you would understand this too”\nHe raised a sword. And the sword was dyed with black.\nCreepy!\nA weird energy. A force which could cut through anything.\n‘Supreme Sky Demon Sword?’\nThe fox’s eyes trembled. That sword, an absolute secret weapon which could cut down anything in the world, a sword technique that Chun Ma made before he disappeared.\nShe had seen the power with her own eyes.\nChak!\nChun Yeowun drew a vertical line towards her.\nThe black line split the air.\n‘I need to avoid it!’\nWoong!\nIn that brief moment, the Golden Gumiho turned to the side by emitting out golden light. The size of her body shrunk. However, she couldn’t completely avoid the speed at which the black line cut the air.\nTwo of her tails were cut.\nChak!\nKyaaaak!\nA shriek from her mouth.\nTwo tails, which had never been cut since the immemorial times, were cut.\nThe pain was indescribable.\nSwoosh!\nShe turned into her human form. But unlike before, she was looking young and short too.\nFrom a mid-20s woman, she now looked like an 18-year-old girl.\n‘Yokai energy….’\nHer two tails were cut off. Her yokai energy in her nine tails was reduced and the core, called fox orb, had lost its energy too.\nShh!\nThe touch of something sharp pressing her. Chun Yeowun’s invisible sword was on her neck.\n‘Hmm.’\nActually, Chun Yeowun was planning on killing the fox. But since he found out that she had a relationship with his ancestor, he was hesitating if he should or not.\nIgnoring the sword, the woman asked.\n“Really not Chun Ma?”\nBoth eyes were trembling. Chun Yeowun sighed.\n“… I am Chun Ma, but it is a title I inherited from my ancestor.”\nWhen she heard Chun Yeowun’s words, her eyes reddened. And his voice, the man she liked, his voice rang in her head.\n[I won’t disappear. The one who will succeed me will become another Chun Ma. I don’t know when that will be though.]\n[That means they are just your descendants.]\nHe smiled at her words and said,\n[This is how humans live forever,]\nThe strong nostalgia. A single tear fell down the pure white cheek of the 18-year-old Golden Gumiho.\nWith a red face, she said to Chun Yeowun.\n“No. You are undoubtedly Chun Ma.”",

      "content": "Chapter 148: Demonic Sealing Whip (1)\n‘She is so stubborn.’\nChun Yeowun shook his head. However, looking at the eyes and the expression, she seemed like someone who had realized something.\nIt was the thought that perhaps she knew the answer to the question.\n“Think whatever you want.”\nChung Yeowun wasn’t the kind of person who repeated the same words over and over again.\nHe thought that there was no point speaking to someone who had no intention of listening to him.\nFortunately, the Golden Gumiho understood it.\n“You look a lot like him. All of the ones who were his direct descendants didn’t look like him at all.”\nShe watched the descendants of Chun Ma for decades.\nHowever, it was difficult to find anyone resembling him. Except for the one standing in front of her.\n“Are you going to kill me?”\nThe Golden Gumiho asked, looking at the invisible swords close to her neck.\nAt that, Chun Yeowun stared at her, letting the energy disperse slowly.\nShhh!\nAnd the swords disappeared as if they never existed.\nThere was a gleam in her eyes.\n“If you don’t kill me, the world will be in danger.”\nShe said with her eyes wide open. Although she looked like an 18 year old girl, she was a catastrophe which existed since the start of the world.\nChun Yeowun looked at her and said,\n“Not interested.”\nAt that, she smiled.\n“Indeed, it is similar.”\nChun Yeowun clicked his tongue.\n“You knew Chun Ma and that was it, stop.”\nChun Yeowun had demonstrated his abilities and was no longer interested in her. He was thinking of sparing her since she seemed to know his ancestor. But looking at her now, it didn’t seem like she would harm anyone.\nHowever, something unexpected happened.\n“Since you saved me. I will follow you from now on.”\nChun Yeowun raised his brows.\nNormally, he would have immediately brought the opposite person towards his side, but for some reason, she wasn’t appealing to him.\nSo he let her go.\n“You have been imprisoned here for a long time, enjoy your freedom.”\n“No. I want to go with you.”\nChun Yeowun started to feel bothered.\nShe put on a nice pose and spoke to Chun Yeowun who shook his head.\n“Look here. A beautiful woman with a body like mine is wanting to be with you. Isn’t that a good thing? Right?”\n‘…’\nAs her power had diminished, she was now nothing great.\n“Tch.”\n“Did you just 'tch'?”\nNot interested in her, Chun Yeowun landed on the ground. The top of the peak was already broken.\nTak!\nGumiho followed him.\nChun Yeowun asked the naked one.\n“Are you going to stay like this?”\n“Ah, I have been locked for a long time so I forgot. Why? Is your manhood twitching looking at my body?”\n“… do you want to die?”\n“Sheesh, you are colder than him.”\nShe mumbled as if she wasn’t pleased.\nAnd then, the clothes of a pretty woman which could only be seen in the original timeline of Chun Yeowun came up.\n‘Hmm.’\nIt was also said that Gumiho had a great stealth, and that didn’t seem like a rumor.\n“Kay! Happy now?”\nChun Yeowun didn’t answer her.\nTak!\nAnd in front of him came two figures. They were Elder Seong and Elder Gyeong.\nElder Gyeong looked at Gumiho and asked.\n“Why didn’t you kill that beast?”\nHe watched the battle and how absurdly it ended.\nBoth Elders didn’t understand why Chun Yeowun didn't kill her.\nChun Yeowun casually said,\n“There won’t be any problems.”\n“Are you really saying that? That yokai is an existence which harms the world…”\nWheik!\nBefore he could finish it, something flew at Elder Gyeong. A golden tail.\nTak!\n“Kuak!”\nConfused, Elder Gyeong created a sword to block it.\nHowever, because of her massive strength, he was thrown to the side.\nTatata!\nIt wasn’t as bad as in the beginning, he was only pushed 10 steps.\n“Sheesh. If only my strength didn’t die down, you would have been done.”\nShe had lost two tails.\n‘This was weak?’\nElder Seong struck his tongue. Elder Gyeong was the best and a Divine Master.\nBut despite being in her human form, she could push him back.\n‘She is dangerous.’\nElder Seong moved.\nTak!\nAnd then bowed his head to Chun Yeowun.\n“What is this supposed to mean?”\nThis man openly questioned Chun Yeowun a moment ago.\nSo what is this now?\n“Elder Seong Jin-gyu of Murim, greets the great Demon God.”\n‘Ah.’\nOnly then did Chun Yeowun understand. He must have heard that he was the 2nd Chun Ma.\nIt was still surprising.\nHis own descendants didn’t believe him when he said it but this man, Elder Seong, seemed to believe him.\n“Do you know me?”\n“How can I not know about you?”\n“But I guess you are stupid, it is because of that this place was stained with the Blue Sky.”\nAt those words, Elder Seong felt odd.\n‘I guess it was true.’\nHe knew the things of the past.\nHe also heard that Chun Yeowun’s grandfather, the 22nd Lord of Sky Demon Order, was a member of Eun Jarim, and was constantly against the enemy Blade God.\n“Senior’s grandfather, Lord Chun Inji, was a member of Eun Jarim, how can you call us like that?”\n“What are you trying to say?”\n“Huh?”\n“Now that you introduced and set the past out, you have something to say right?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, Elder Seong was flustered.\nWith utmost caution, he tried to speak.\n“Senior. The Golden Gumiho is a yokai, as Elder Gyeong said. The reason why she was imprisoned was because of her existence which turned the balance. If you release a yokai, destruction will come to the world, please consider releasing it.”\nElder Seong was convinced about releasing her out into the world, but it would be difficult to push Chun Yeowun, who was the Demon God, to kill her, so he tried to put it respectfully.\nAt that, Chun Yeowun said,\n“If you think it is dangerous, kill it yourself.”\n“Huh?!”\nElder Seong and Elder Gyeong were both shocked at it.\nEven if she lost 2 tails, she was still a Gumiho.\n“Feeling bad that I am walking out? Maybe I should just kill you all.”\nThe golden-haired Gumiho licked her lips. She had a playful face, but she would do it if allowed.\n“S-senior!”\n“Are you really sending her into the world?”\nThe two looked at Chun Yeowun with worried faces. They couldn’t stop Chun Yeowun or the Gumiho.\n‘It is impossible.’\nElder Seong bit his lip and spoke.\n“Then Senior. Can I just ask for one favor?”\n“Favor?”\n“Without you, no one can control Gumiho. If this Golden Gumiho harms the world, who can stop her?”\n“Elder Seong!”\nElder Gyeong couldn’t figure out what he was trying to do.\nElder Seong didn’t bother and continued.\n[What to do? Elder Gyeong? Can we stop that Yokai?]\n[Sigh…]\nHe was just merely suggesting something.\nAnd it was true that there was no one who could stop her.\nChun Yeowun looked at the fox which kept clinging to him with an annoyed face.\n“Right right. If I need to be stopped, I need to be next to you.”\n“Don’t touch me.”\n“… you are so rude.”\nGumiho had a sullen expression.\n‘This is gum sticking on.’\nHe was already bothered by Shakena who stuck to him. And now this one too.\nAfter thinking, Chun Yeowun decided to take her, but it was then.\nFlinch!\nHe suddenly reached out to the floor.\nPsss!\nFragments shattered revealing something underneath.\nIt was a round, black sphere.\n‘This?’\nAs he was puzzled, he was about to touch it, when something like a black rope stretched out from the sphere and tried to wrap itself around Chun Yeowun.\nPak!\nWhen Chun Yeowun swung his sword, they went back.\nChachacha!\nA very long black rope.\nIt was strange, as it was so long that the end couldn’t be seen, like a snake.\nHowever, as the black rope kept moving, someone who was inside it could be seen.\n“Mak Wei-gang!”\nIt was Mak Wei-gang.\n‘He is alive!’\nThey all thought he was caught in the charm of Gumiho and died after the place shattered.\n‘Damn that beast!’\nMak Wei-gang was staring at Gumiho.\nHe was aware that he was possessed by it because he had his memories intact.\n“So you are Mak Wei-gang.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, he smiled bitterly.\n“What a bad day. To be able to see my enemy here.”\nHe was able to hear everything despite being within the sphere, and was shocked when Elder Seong called him Demon God.\nDemon God Chun Yeowun which made the family of Mak go into hiding for hundreds of years.\n“It is fine. For the sake of Blue Sky, I was going to get rid of all your people, since you appeared, I will start with you.”\nElder Seong thought this was absurd. He knew the ignorance this man had, but he couldn’t believe that Mak Wei-gang thought he could defeat Chun Yeowun.\n“It seems like the charm wore off when the tail was cut. Then again!”\nShe looked at Mak Wei-gang and used her charm.\nNothing happened.\n“Huh?”\n“You foolish yokai. As long as I am the owner of this whip, your tricks wouldn’t work on me.”\nMak Wei-gang handled the whip.\nChak!\nThe black string flew towards her.\nLaughing through her teeth, she tried to use her tail, but the black whip wrapped itself around the tail.\n“Ah!”\nWheik!\nThe whip moved around the tail and wrapped around her body like a snake. It seemed that the energy in the whip was too much for her to break through.\n“Damned divine item!”\n“Hahahaha!”\nMak Wei-gang smiled as if liked it and looking at Chun Yeowun he said.\n“These divine artifacts can be used like this.”\nA mysterious light shone from the black whip.\n“Ack!”\nThe eyes of the Gumiho turned dazed with it. As if the emotions had been lost.\nDemonic Sealing Whip.\nA weapon called Divine Artifact wasn’t just a whip. It could subdue the opponent and absorb the power.\nThe scariest thing was that it could control beings like monsters, spirits and stuff.\nWith her 2 tails cut off, she wasn’t strong enough to subdue its force.\n“Golden Gumiho. The time has come for the battle of the Demo…”\nBefore he could even finish speaking.\nTick!\n“Kuak!”\nMak Wei-gang held his chest. Something seemed to have pierced his chest and now it was hurting him.\n“T-this is…”\nChun Yeowun spoke to him in a sarcastic manner.\n“Idiot. Did you think I’d keep watching if you used it?”\nA sword which transcends the will of the owner. The Heart Sword.\n‘N-No.’\nEven before he could properly use the new weapon he acquired, he was rendered useless.",

      "content": "Chapter 149: Demonic Sealing Whip (2)\nMak Wei-gang tried to push out the Heart Sword with his internal energy, but it was to no avail. From the get-go, the gap between him and Chun Yeowun was simply too big.\n‘Kuak… a Heart Sword?’\nMak Wei-gang didn’t expect to be able to stop the Heart Sword – even if he did manage to stop it, it felt like he would die before completely stopping it. Chun Yeowun walked towards him.\n“Forces of Great Heaven.”\n“Kuak.”\n“You guys managed to survive like little rats in hiding. Are there others who share the same baseless ideology as you?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s question, Mak Wei-gang spoke with red eyes.\n“Th…. Th… the Forces of Great Heaven… is forever! We will rebuild the… Blue Sky Brotherhood…”\n“Well, I already killed all of your men that were here.”\n‘!?’\nMak Wei-gang’s eyes trembled. He had no idea that outside the peak, all the extremists he brought in and the foundation he had built for over 50 years were no more.\n“Are any of your family members out there?”\nChun Yeowun asked. He wanted to get rid of all of them for sure this time.\n“Where are they?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s question, Mak Wei-gang cried out in pain.\n“Kuak… foolish man… Come on now… You think…. I’ll answer?”\nEven if he died, he wasn’t going to reveal where they were. In response, Chun Yeowun smiled.\n“Think.”\n“What?”\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun’s hand pierced Mak Wei-gang’s chest.\nPuck!\n“Kuak!”\nA blue light spread from Chun Yeowun’s wristguard into Mak Wei-gang’s body through his chest.\n“Ughhh!”\nHis face had its life drained from it and turned white. After acquiring the ability of Ghost Entity, Chun Yeowun didn’t bother with torture anymore.\n‘Two birds, one stone.’\nMak Wei-gang was a Supreme Master level warrior, and it was difficult to obtain a Ghost at such a high level.\nChun Yeowun then read the memories to find out where the rest of Mak Wei-gang’s family were.\nShhh!\nUpon Mak Wei-gang’s death, the whip around the Golden Gumiho was freed and she tried to destroy it once more.\n“Damned item! I will destroy you!”\n“Stop.”\nChun Yeowun ordered her to stop.\n“Why? With your strength, there shouldn’t be any need for it.”\nFor her, a Yokai, this whip was a dangerous weapon. If it weren’t for the whip, she would have never been trapped there.\n‘This seems familiar.’\nChun Yeowun thought that the whip looked familiar, as if he had seen it somewhere before. He recognized the engraving on the handle to the work on it, and even the shape of the whip as well.\nShhh!\nWhen Chun Yeowun reached out his hand, the whip on the floor was sucked into his hand. As he held its handle and grabbed the whip part, he could make out the numerous sentences engraved on it.\n‘Taoist scriptures?’\nThe symbols that were engraved were common engravings in Taoist paraphernalia. In other words, these were the symbols that Taoists used to make talismans and other spiritual objects.\nCheowun knew that the ancestors of the Forest Lord had used this whip to seal the Golden Gumiho, so it had to be a relic from the past.\nBut,\n[The material of the whip is the same as that of the wrist guard of the user.]\n‘What?’\nChun Yeowun narrowed his eyes at Nano’s information and then he realized why the whip felt so familiar.\n‘Is it that?’\nIt was from the blueprint presumed to belong to the Demon realm that Chun Yeowun obtained by killing the Demon realm’s traitor, Hagar. That was where Chun Yeowun saw the whip!\nHe remembered that the whip was a weapon that had transformed into a right leg shield.\n‘Then.’\nJust like how his wrist guard which turned into the Sky Demon Sword, Chun Yeowun tried to infuse Sky Demon Energy into the handle of the whip.\nWoo!\nThe whip trembled strongly.\nSomething was blocking the Sky Demon Energy from entering. As the Taoist engraving radiated a red glow, it seemed like it was the source of the blockage.\n‘That’s blocking it?’\nChun Yeowun touched the writing on the whip with two fingers. And in the parts where the engraving was done, Chun Yeowun focused the channeling of the Sky Demon Energy.\nWhoong!\nThe engraving seemed to have little defense despite its ability to repulse the energy, but it soon gave in and the Sky Demon Energy found its way into the whip.\nGrrr!\nAs each of the letters engraved were being overtaken and consumed, the whip began trembling. The Gumiho’s energy that was trapped within the whip for over a millenia was finally escaping from its prison.\nGoooo!\n“My strength! My strength!”\nThe Golden Gumiho was surprised as she watched this unfold. The Demonic Sealing Whip had sealed her for so long and kept absorbing her energy to suppress her.\nNow that all the energy was escaping from the whip once the Sky Demon Energy overtook the engravings, she could feel the yokai energy that had been absorbed for nearly 1,800 years return back to her.\nChun Yeowun grabbed the handle again and infused Sky Demon Energy into it once more. Unlike before, there was some resilience, but something strange occurred...\nWoong!\nThe whip resonated and the yokai energy inside reacted to the Sky Demon Energy. Then, the yokai energy started to enter his body.\n“Kuak!”\nChun Yeowun couldn’t hide his shock as a new foreign energy was entering his body –the Golden Gumiho’s yokai energy. It was an unmistakingly evil energy.\nTuk!\nThe veins on his hand began turning blue, as if the yokai energy was infecting his body.\n“What are you doing?! Chun Ma! Get your hands off of the damn whip!”\nRealizing that something unusual was happening, she tried to help Chun Yeowun.\nPang!\n“Ack!”\nHowever, an unknown force pushed her away. It was the yokai energy that was stored for 1,800 years that was strong enough to push her.\nPapapak!\nAn energy sphere formed around Chun Yeowun, and everything within 10 meters was pushed out. Both of the elders were shocked at this.\n“W-what just happened?”\n“I don’t know, but…”\nThey knew approaching this new energy would be dangerous, and that Chun Yeowun’s condition was not looking too good.\nTuk!\nNow his face gained a certain repulsiveness when blue veins began to form within his facial features.\n“Ack!”\nEven Chun Yeowun, who was accustomed to pain, couldn’t hold back a groan. There was a problem when the yokai energy collided with the spiritual energy and the energy of the five cores that were residing within Chun Yeowun.\nAll the energies within him were now fighting against the yokai energy. As these opposing energies fought, Chun Yeowun's body became a battlefield with him having to take the burden.\n-Fsss\n[Warning! Body is unstable.]\nNano was restoring the internal injuries. Normally the recovery would be done by the spiritual energy from the Spirit cores, but because they were battling the yokai energy at the moment, it was up to Nano.\n‘I need them to calm down.’\nChun Yeowun sat down right away and concentrated. He had no choice but to contain this new energy within him and balance its flow.\nAnd the perfect energy to do so was:\n‘Sky Demon Energy!’\nIt was the only energy that could absorb all the other energies, so he tried to balance the clashing energies using the Sky Demon Energy as the center, but a strange thing happened.\nThe spiritual energy from the Spirit Beast cores and the yokai energy, which had been rampaging against one another just moments before, were now in perfect harmony like yin and yang. The two energies aligned and circulated smoothly in Chun Yeowun’s body as if they were always like this.\nWoong!\nThis new golden energy along with the five-colored spiritual energy arose in Chun Yeowun’s body.\nElder Gyeong, who looked at it, bit his lip.\n“… what an unbelievable energy.”\nIt was a lot greater than the energy of the Golden Gumiho that he faced.\nIn fact, it wasn’t an evil or natural energy, but one of true chaos.\nGoo!\nAnd Chun Yeowun was stabilizing it.\nPhat!\nAt one point, Chun Yeowun’s consciousness was fading out as if he was returning to nothingness. However, this was something he had experienced several times.\nHe entered the unconscious world from when he first obtained the Sky Demon Sword.\n-Strange. So strange.\nSomeone’s voice was heard. Chun Yeowun, without a body, naturally turned his head to where the sound was coming from.\nThere was an old man in white robes. From just the white beard alone, Chun Yeowun could tell this man had to be either a famous swordsman or a sage.\n-How did something like this fall from the sky?\nThe old man looked up. He was standing inside a very deep pit that was a crater of sorts.\n-I thought a star had fallen. Hehe, this can’t be that.\nThe old man picked something up. It was the Demonic Sealing Whip.\nThe old man who was paying close attention to the Demonic Sealing Whip then shook his head as white mist rose from his feet and his body began to float.\n‘What?’\nChun Yeowun looked at the floating man and realized that the location changed to a thatched house. In the house, the old man was engraving characters on it one after another, but not with ink but rather a substance resembling melted gold.\nShh!\nSomeone appeared. Another person wearing the same robes entered the room with his back to Chun Yeowun. What was unnatural was that his eyebrows and beard were red.\n-Sage Cheok Mino, you are here?\n-Are you saying that these things fell all over Yunnan?\nThe old man in the red beard named Cheok Mino asked as he put something on the sword that was made of black iron radiating a brilliant light.\n-Huh. Another one?\nThe old man who was engraving sighed.\n-Isn’t this strange? Weapons made of this unknown material are falling from the sky. Doesn’t it seem like a bad omen?\n-Right. Did you recover all of said weapons?\n-Unfortunately, the other three have fallen into the hands of people.\n-Sigh\n-Should I tell you something interesting? The sword shaped thing fell into the hands of the man you spoke of before, the one who didn’t seem like a human. He noticed me even though I was 40 kilometers away. He’s truly extraordinary.\n-And you backed out?\n-There was nothing I could do about it cause I didn’t want to show my face.\n‘Five things?’\nChun Yeowun was puzzled. According to the conversation, besides the two weapons, three more fell.\nAnd according to the drawings in Hagar’s safe, there were a total of seven in the set.\n‘What the hell are these weapons?’\nThere was no meteorite that fell, but rather the weapons themselves fell. Cheok Mino asked.\n-So? Do you have to seal them?\n-Don’t you think so? These weapons pull in the energy around them. Let it be good or bad energy. I don’t think they will bring goodness to the world.\n-Then, this thing will have to be sealed and kept somewhere.\n-Mount Oji?\n-Wouldn’t it be too dangerous to place them together in Kunlun Mountains?\nThe old man agreed. It seemed like there was something else. But the vision ended there and the two people disappeared like smoke.\nPhat!\nAnd Chun Yeowun’s eyes shone.\nAs he looked around, he could see Elder Gyeong and Elder Seong and even the Gumiho holding their breaths.\nThey were keeping an eye on the changes that were happening, but something was missing on his body.\n‘Huh?’\nChun Yeowun then realized that his clothes were gone.\n‘No!’\nHis body felt stronger than before. Looking at his energies that were now in harmony, he realized his newfound strength.\n“I congratulate you on your achievement, Senior.”\nElder Seong who looked at him said it with a shocked face, knowing that Chun Yeowun knew for sure what had happened.\n‘Have I undergone body reconstruction again?’\nThis would be his fifth time, and it wasn’t by some realization.\n‘Ha!’\nHis body had gone through another transformation to handle the new energy. It was truly amazing.\n‘Where did it go? Ah!’\nHe couldn’t find the whip he was holding so as he looked for it, he saw it as an iron guard on his right ankle.\nChun Yeowun, who saw it, thought it was weird.\n‘Just what exactly are these weapons?’",

      "content": "Chapter 150: Demonic Sealing Whip (3)\n“Haaa.”\nA middle-aged man with small eyes let out a long sigh. He was the Lord of the Green Forest and the Eun Jarim as well as the Lord of Snow Line of Kunlun Mountains.\nAlthough he looked young, he was more than three hundred and sixty years old. There were three elders sitting in front of him and they all had expressions of regret, as a lot had happened in the past few hours.\nThe Golden Gumiho that had been imprisoned by the ancestors was released and part of Eun Jarim was sacrificed. Both internal and external matters were breaking the man’s heart.\n“Did you find that kid?”\nAt the question from the Lord, Elder Seong and Elder Gyeong shook their heads. They were trying to find out the whereabouts of his daughter, Ha Baek-ryeong, as she was his only blood, but she seemed to have disappeared.\nSince the peak collapsed, there should have been some bodies or corpses, but none could be found.\n‘Probably dead.’\nThe red candle in the Lord’s room was out. It was the candle that displayed her condition.\n‘Is this retribution?’\nHe sighed. He regretted what had happened. As the leader of extremists, Mak Wei-gang and his influence were bad, and the Lord knew that his daughter was changing because of that. However, he left it alone because he thought that a person should be rational enough to understand the consequences and results, but they were disastrous.\n‘Baek-ryeong. Baek-ryeong… ahhh.’\nIt was the heart of a father who wept for his daughter who was lost. Seeing him in full sorrow, the elders bowed their heads.\n“It is our fault.”\n“Please punish us.”\nThe Lord shook his head.\n“… No. It all happened because of me, so how can I dare blame you all?”\nThe air in the room grew heavier. Ark Young felt the most burdened. It was the first time since the Snow Line was established that such blood was shed.\n“And where is he?”\nArk Young answered the Lord’s question.\n“He is on the other peak.”\n“That one?”\n“… He said that he would wait for Lord.”\nThe Lord asked for the details surrounding Chun Yeowun. Having heard what happened, he even wanted to meet the man.\nThe Sleeping Heavenly Peak, the new peak which had not only risen but destroyed as well. Chun Yeowun was there trying out the Demonic Sealing Whip.\nPapapak!\nHu Bong’s eyes widened at it.\n“Wow! Lord, what kind of whip can stretch out like that?”\nThe whip swung by Chun Yeowun stretched out for more than 10 meters. It seemed like it could stretch out as far as the user wanted it to go.\nPapapak!\n‘I’ve got the whip, but I’m just not used to this.’\nWhips were used in the cult as well, but they weren’t that great for battles so there was not much focus on their usage.\n‘Hmm, should I take this chance to try it out?’\nIt was worthwhile to use this.\nSnore!\nA small snore could be heard. It was the little fox with golden fur that had been asleep on his shoulder. This was, indeed, the Gumiho.\nShe wasn’t just able to change her form into a human, but also change her forms within the fox into a cub.\n“Hmm.”\nDespite telling her not to stay, she insisted on being with him. At first, Chun Yeowun prevented it, but then he gave in and let her attach herself on his shoulder.\nChachacha!\nWhen Chun Yeowun infused the whip with the Sky Demon Energy, it turned into a guard on the leg. However, unlike an actual guard, it looked more like a snake rolling around.\nDid it have its own personality?\nChun Yeowun kept thinking about it.\n‘Is it better to try and get the other ones too?’\nIn addition to this, he knew the locations of two other weapons. One was on Olkhon Island in Russia, where the Dan family stayed.\nThe other was in Mount Oji, which was the place that the man Mino had talked about.\n‘I wonder what it’ll turn into when all of them are put together.’\nWhile Chun Yeowun immersed in his thoughts, a group of four arrived. They were the Lord, Ark Young and the other two elders.\nThe Lord approached Chun Yeowun and looked at the golden fox that was sleeping on his shoulder. At a glance, it looked like nothing more than a cute pet.\n‘Is this the one?’\nWho would guess that this little fox was the yokai that could bring doom to the world? However, after learning how to distinguish between energies, the Lord could see its true energy.\nIt was well taken care of now, but if this fox blew up again, it would be difficult to keep up with it.\n“You are the Lord.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s arrogant tone, Elder Gyeong frowned. He was accustomed to the man’s tone, but he couldn’t stay still when his Lord was addressed with the same tone.\nHowever, he said nothing because Ark Young and Elder Seong confirmed that this man was Chun Yeowun of the past, the Demon God.\n[Lord. That person…]\nElder Gyeong tried to inform the Lord.\n‘Lord?’\nThe man was looking at Chun Yeowun with wide eyes. Just looking at it, it seemed like he was surprised.\n‘No way…’\nThe Lord couldn’t believe what he saw. Having learned to feel the true nature of each energies for more than 350 years, he was skilled. He even knew how to feel fate and prophecies.\n‘Just who is he…’\nA person’s fate sometimes showed in the colors surrounding them. In the Lord’s eyes, Chun Yeowun was chaotic. The space around was badly shaking and numerous colors were moving, creating a haze-like feel.\n‘Is he human? I can’t read him at all.’\nHe couldn’t see Heaven's Will.\nHe was the kind to know what kind of person the other was by looking at their flow of fate, but it was proving to be difficult.\n“How long are you going to look at me for? I’m guessing your eyes are special.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s question, the Lord was taken aback.\n‘Did he realize it?’\nWhen he tried to read the fate, the other person wouldn’t notice the difference in it. However, if one was aware of this, they could figure out by looking at the white tinge in the eyes.\n“What are you trying to do with those eyes?”\nThe Lord, who was shocked, answered Chun Yeowun’s question.\n“… I was trying to see who you were.”\nHe couldn’t tell it despite trying to see. As if guessing that much, Chun Yeowun asked.\n“Really? And how did it look?”\n“I haven’t gotten a clue. It seems like this old man cannot read yours.”\nChun Yeowun sighed.\n“Well, your body seems to have recovered.”\nAt that, the Lord expressed his gratitude.\n“I heard from the elders that you saved this old man. I’m very thankful for it.”\n“Is that all you can do?”\nIt sounded like Chun Yeowun was dissatisfied. The Lord spoke in a bitter tone.\n“Many sacrifices have been made today. I was not present, but I lost my one and only blood. I know it isn’t your fault, but it still hurts my heart.”\nHe was in a mess. However, Chun Yeowun had no intention of considering his words.\nIn the first place, it was because he, the Lord who was responsible for this place, didn't rule it properly that such a thing happened.\n“But…”\nThe Lord brought about the main point, but Chun Yeowun asked.\n“Heavenly Killing Star. I want to hear about that.”\n“Heavenly Killing Star”\nThe Lord frowned at it. He didn’t think that the person would be curious about that. In fact, before the Lord woke up, Chun Yeowun had asked the other 2 elders about a Heavenly Killing Star. But they knew nothing.\n‘He was the person who held the position of 1st elder, overpowering the Gyeong family that protected the Lord, and was the person who had been there the longest along with the Lord.’\nDespite that, the moment they found out he was the Heavenly Killing Star, they kicked him out.\nStrictly speaking, the man left on his own.\n“I need to know what was being discussed before he left this place.”\n“… and why would you need that?”\nThe Lord asked.\n“I have some work with him.”\n“Work?”\n“Since when was he here?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s question, the Lord looked at the elders. If they hadn’t informed him to some extent, he wouldn’t have gotten used to this man.\n“May I ask why?”\n“It is said that the Eun Jarim settled here about 300 years back or something like that. But no matter how I look at it, it seems like he is a person whom I heard of during my days.”\nIn the original time of Chun Yeowun there was a Heavenly Body possessed man who was called a genius in the Forces of Evil. And Chun Yeowun thought that maybe the true identity of that Heavenly Body person was Heavenly Killing Star.\nHowever, that meant that the person would have lived for a long time, and no elder knew for sure how long the man lived. Even Ark Young, who knew Mr. Cho, didn’t know how long he had lived for.\n‘Ahh… now that I see, wasn’t he known to be famous a thousand years back?’\nThe Lord was surprised to hear that from Ark Young and Elder Seong. He knew that Murim people who practiced cultivation and internal energy for a long time live longer, but living past a thousand years was impossible.\n‘Who could even guess that this man lived past a thousand?’\nChun Yeowun looked like he was in his twenties. Of course, that was his true age. But he didn’t say it as he knew people wouldn’t believe that he had skipped through time.\nAt that time, the Lord swung his fingers.\nShush!\nRed letters engraved in the air formed around Chun Yeowun in a circle, and created a barrier from the outside.\n“Lord!”\n“My Lord!”\nHu Bong and the elders were shocked.\n“What are you doing!”\nWheik!\nHu Bong fired a flame sphere to destroy the barrier. Ark Young tried to stop him.\n“Stop. Mr. Hu.. it seems like they two are talking alone.”\n“What?”\nThe Lord was saying something inside the curtain like Ark Young had told, but the words couldn’t be heard from outside.\nAs expected, the Lord had opened a place only for just the two of them to talk.\n“Is it okay if the two of us talk?”\nAt that moment, the golden fox sleeping on Chun Yeowun’s shoulder woke up, and its tails stood up as she looked at the man.\n-You are his successor!\nBoth of her eyes became dyed with yokai energy.\n“You run rampant, and I will kill you this time.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s warning, the fox snorted.\n-This is unfair!\nShe then tried to enter Chun Yeowun’s suit, as she was desperate not to stray too far from him. At that, the Lord stuck his tongue.\n‘The Golden Gumiho is acting according to him.’\nHe thought it was weird, wondering if such a thing could even be controlled, but this man seemed like he could.\n“Is this fine?”\nChun Yeowun asked, pointing to the fox that stayed attached to him. To that, the Lord nodded as if he didn’t care.\n‘Hmm.’\nCun Yeowun thought it was strange, but he didn’t care.\n“If it is you, I think you must have known something about Mr. Cho.”\nAt the Lord's words, Chun Yeowun’s eyes shone knowing that he was right.\n“He is defying his entire destiny. His fixed lifespan and even his missions aren’t the same, and I was very afraid of it.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“I think you are the answer that Mr. Cho is searching for.”\n“What?”\n“Mr. Cho came here to become youthful.”\nThis was something no elders knew. It was because he, too, only knew it after Mr. Cho asked for poison.\n“At first I didn’t realize. I just thought that he was trying to control his life.”\n“… but that wasn’t it.”\n“Exactly. That wasn’t his goal.”\nOn the day that he was teaching Mr. Cho his family’s technique, the man asked.\n[Isn’t there a way to learn the technique without suppressing the blood flow within?]\nHe was asking for the malice intent to overflow, but learning something while letting that rage happen would be impossible.\nRecognizing that, each time that the technique was taught, his blood pressure points were sealed, Mr. Cho asked him to bypass it.\n“I said it was impossible.”\nAt that, he said something unexpected.\n[Then this doesn’t work.]\n[What do you mean?]\n[… even if I learn this, I cannot stop aging.]\nThe very old man was able to suppress death and shape his own fate. But the moment the Lord heard those words, he knew that he had misunderstood Mr. Cho.\n“What he wanted to learn was how to gain youth.”\nThe secret to living long without martial arts. That was what he wanted.\nAnd despite not learning martial arts, the Lord was getting stronger slowly and so was his daughter. And the moment he saw through the true intention of the man, he felt the need to respond to him.\n“But then he himself said he would leave.”\nEun Jarim had one rule.\nOnce outsiders come in, they live and die here, not leaving into the world on their own accord but only for mission. And if they want to leave of their own volition, they have to lose their martial arts.\n“He looked fine to me.”\nSeeing the Time Rewind ability, the man was fine. The Lord who went silent as he turned back, opened his shirt and showed his chest.\nA scar on it.\n“About 50 years ago, he asked to leave as he was. And he left this scar.”\nChun Yeowun thought this was intriguing.\n“You were threatened.”\n“… I tried to subdue him, but I was defeated.”\nThe Lord thought he could subdue him, but then became scared for his life.\n“He said that if I tried to stop him, he would annihilate all who were here.”\n“Ha!”\nOnly then did Chun Yeowun find out why this man had blocked the sound. It was because the truth was different from what the other people outside knew. The people here thought that the man was sent out because of the Lord, but not because the Lord was threatened.\n“It was an inevitable choice to save everyone.”\nChun Yeowun spoke with a smile.\n“So funny.”\n“What is?”\n“You could kill him and your life was threatened, so wouldn’t it be funny to think you decided to save your face after letting him go?”\nThe Lord thought of crying at those words. Because it was an undeniable fact.\nDespite having been through it, he concealed the truth.\n“In the end, despite knowing he was dangerous, you just let him go.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, the man sighed. But Chun Yeowun knew that if the others knew the truth they wouldn’t have been this loyal to the Lord.\nThe Lord bit his lip.\n“… You are right. It all happened due to my fault. When I saw a man with Heavenly energy who was trying to change fate, I shouldn’t have let him.”\n“Heavenly energy?”\nTo Chun Yeowun who was puzzled, the man continued.\n“Mr. Cho, no, Cho Yushin, after that man, this is the second time I have seen it.”\n“What are you talking about?”\n“I heard from Elder Seong that you are called Chun Ma (Heavenly Demon).”\nWith that, the Lord stretched out his hand and pointed to the floor. And the whole ground was filled with red letters.\nChhh!\nThe space around the ground shook and showed strange things. The energy inside that place seemed to explode at any moment, and even the fox seemed startled a bit.\n-Yah! What are you trying to do?\n“Our Ha family, and the descendants of the Ha family, have collected information in preparation for the moment the seal is broken.”\nWhen the Lord took off the black robe he had on, a white robe with gold letters was revealed under it and an overwhelming energy broke out. This was something that the ancestors of the Ha family have passed down from generation to generation.\nThe Lord looked at Chun Yeowun and the fox with eyes full of determination.\n“This old man doesn’t want the same thing to repeat again. I cannot send a dangerous person like you and that Golden Gumiho into the world.”\nThe Lord opened his eyes wide. He was sacrificing himself to destroy the fox and Chun Yeowun. At that, Chun Yeowun shook his head.\n“And I even saved your life…”\n“I am sorry. But since this has already been triggered, you won’t be able to escape it. The sin I committed…”\nThud!\nChun Yeowun’s feet dug into the floor and the moment the floor cracked. With that, the red letters on the floor began to lose the light.\n‘How!’\nIt meant that something was stopping it, flustered the Lord tried to use everything he could to overpower it.\nPak!\nWith the speed of lightning, he tore off the robe and, when he lifted it up, the space shook as it sucked in the robe.\nSwosh!\nThe energy that was about to destroy him disappeared.\n“W-what did you do…”\n“Did you think I wouldn’t know?”\n‘!?’\nWhen he was puzzled, Chun Yeowun spoke in a cold voice.\n“You wanted to talk between just the two of us, but didn’t mind letting the fox stay? You only learned to use the technique but you are innately stupid.”\n“W-wait…”\n“Like father, like daughter I guess.”\n“What?”\nAs soon as he said that, Chun Yeowun’s hand was nailed into the Lord’s forehead.",

      "content": "Chapter 151: Hayden Hotel (1)\nReading others’ heavenly energy. Or seeing their fate.\nIt was never beneficial; those who strayed on the path of good would still meet an unhappy future.\nPuck!\n“Huak!”\nThe Lord grabbed his head, but not a single drop of blood flowed out. The forehead that was supposed to have been pierced seemed fine.\n“What are you doing?”\nChun Yeowun asked, looking at him. The Lord was trembling in fear.\n‘Was that my future?’\nOut of caution, he had looked into his own fate. He saw that the moment he used the white robe that his ancestors had passed onto him, he died without having time to save himself.\n‘Is this man an actual monster?’\nSeeing even further into the future was just as shocking as when he looked into Cho Yushin’s.\nThe moment that he died, Elder Gyeong and Elder Seong rushed for Chun Yeowun but he effortlessly managed to kill both of them using a sword full of eerie energy. Then, he saw ghosts coming out of their bodies.\n‘Ahh…’\nThe Lord then realized the fact that attempting to stop the fox and the man would bring him the worst outcome: the destruction of Eun Jarim.\nDrip!\nBeads of cold sweat ran down his forehead and cheek. His body was feeling cold. He remembered the advice his father gave him.\n[Father. Why do we turn our backs on the world when we learn this?]\n[To read the flow is to entangle ourselves with the end. It might be hard to understand now, but the deeper you learn our family’s technique the more you’ll understand what I’m saying.]\nReading the heavenly energy and fate meant to know in advance what wouldn’t be good.\nThis instilled more discipline in a person, and allowed the Lord to understand the reason why his ancestors didn’t enter the outside world.\n‘Because it was meaningless. And it didn’t make sense.’\nEvery time he read fate, it hurt him. He kept telling himself to not read the flow of fate, but he did and each time it filled him with bitterness.\n“Sigh…”\nThe Lord groaned, sighed, and bowed his head to Chun Yeowun.\n“You are right. This all stemmed from my fears and foolishness to save my face. I apologize.”\nChun Yeowun’s eyes shone at it. He felt a subtle feeling that the bowing man was scheming something, but suddenly heard him apologize.\nShh!\nThe Lord raised his hand and part of the curtain opened.\n“Can you send the Golden Gumiho out?”\nAt that, Chun Yeowun looked at the fox.\n-What are you looking at? No, I won’t go.\nShe tried to stick to him, but he picked her up by the tail and threw her out.\n-No! Don’t hold my tail! Ahhhh!\nHe could hear her screaming but the moment she went past the curtain he could hear nothing.\n“What do you want to talk about?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s question, the Lord took off his robe and showed what he was wearing. There were gold letters on the white robe.\nWithout knowing what they meant, Chun Yeowun knew it wasn’t good for him. However, the man took it off and handed it to Chun Yeowun.\n“Hm?”\n“I heard that you are strong. However, the Golden Gumiho you are about to take with you is a yokai that wants destruction. Please take this with you and be prepared for anything she might do.”\n“This is?”\n“It is a robe which has the good energy of our clan instilled in it. If you are accustomed to dealing with energy, you will be able to use it.”\nThe Lord changed the fate he saw. He knew it was impossible to stop both the fox and this man. So he decided to do something better than dying.\n“This might be useless.”\nSaid Chun Yeowun, but he didn’t refuse it. Even if not for him, he could give it to Hu Bong or someone else to be ready to use whenever the fox went out of control. And when Chun Yeowun put it in the shadow, the Lord removed the curtain that blocked the sound.\n-Ugh! I hate you!\nThe moment the curtain vanished, the fox bit Chun Yeowun’s ankle, but rather than actually biting, it seemed like it was only acting to bite. Looking at that, Chun Yeowun sneered.\n“If you are fine, can I ask for a small favor?”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Even though this all happened because of me, it would be dangerous if the Heavenly Killing Star gained eternal life.”\n“So?”\n“You seem to have an idea of what he is and are interested in him, so if you ever meet him, please make sure he doesn’t come here.”\nA cautious request. In fact, it almost sounded like a deal. To that, Chun Yeowun responded.\n“If he blocks my way, he will pay the price.”\nChun Yeowun was sure that he would meet this man because he had connections with MS Group. If that ever happened, Chun Yeowun decided that he would kill him; the Lord didn’t have to request it.\n‘Right. A monster is a perfect opponent for a monster.’\nChun Yeowun’s answer gave him a creepy feeling, but he thought this was good.\n“Then I guess this old man’s worries have been relieved. Elder Ark.”\n“Yes, Lord.”\nArk Young approached him.\n“Did you say that Mr. Chun is your teacher?”\n“I reserved this undeserved honor from him.”\nThere were only five people in the entire Murim world who were Heavenly Masters. And Ark Young thought that it was lucky that he was the disciple of Chun Yeowun who seemed to have a connection with Ark Wei.\n“Stay beside the man and learn well.”\n“Ah! Lord, thank you.”\nArk Young's face brightened. In fact, before Chun Yeowun left, he was waiting to ask for permission to leave his home and go with his teacher.\nHowever, as he was a member of Eun Jarim, he couldn’t just move as he wished and let Chun Yeowun be his teacher. However, now that the permission was given, he could leave.\n“Mr. Chun. I heard that Cho Yushin had some connections with an unidentified group. And as I, a lord who doesn’t know any martial arts, will be sending the elders to help.”\nThe Lord was changing his fate. He regretted not being strong enough, but thanks to the future he saw, he was able to continue the Eun Jarim and the legacy of his ancestors.\nDrrrr!\nA small vibration.\n-You arms are shaking, Chun Ma.\nThe fox tilted its head. Chun Yeowun pulled something out of his coat pocket. An invitation card with an MS lettering in blue. Not knowing when it would come, Chun Yeowun carried it with him at all times.\n‘I am glad that this didn’t burn during the body reconstruction.’\nEverything on his body had burned, but thanks to its special material composition, it was still fine.\n‘Hmm.’\nThe date, time, and place were written on the back of the card and there was a button to accept it.\n'In 3 days?’\nThe next event would be held three days later, at 7 p.m. in the Hayden Hotel in Shanghai.\n‘Where did I hear this….ah!’\nChun Yeowun had heard of this hotel because he knew that Chun Wu-kyung had used the place for trading.\n‘Is this a coincidence?’\nChun Yeowun ordered Nano to check the place without accepting it right away. If it was waiting for a reply, then the signal must be active.\n[Tracking the signal.]\nDrrr!\nNot long after, augmented reality opened. The position was marked in the area of China.\nAnd in it.\n“Hayden Hotel, Shanghai?”\nThe signal was coming from there. It seemed like they were sending the invitation from the hotel and not their base.\n‘We need to go there.’\nIn the end, he had a clue about the auction site. Chun Yeowun looked at the LED screen and pressed the button.\n‘Return Baekgi to me, MS.’\n3 days later.\nShanghai city.\nOriginally, it was just a fishing village. However, Shanghai grew slowly into a financial center, accepting the cultures of every nation within and was one of the most renowned places.\nEven with the Gates opening, Shanghai continued to be a great city.\nThere was Hong Kong as well, which had the most foreigners.\nPeople arrived at the Shanghai City West Underground high speed train station.\nThey were the two secretaries and Bi Mak-heon.\n“Do you always go back and forth like this?”\n“What?”\nAt Im So-hye’s words, Yu So-hwa shot her a glance. Im So-hye changed her attitude right away.\n“I’m just asking.”\nAfter being brought in from Black Athena, her life had changed. She now had to look at Yu So-hwa everyday.\n‘Sigh.’\nBi Mak-heon just sighed as he looked at the women constantly bickering. Fortunately, he was happy that Shakena wasn’t here. He couldn’t fathom a situation where all 3 women would be together.\nHe heard a voice calling to him.\n“Yo~Mak-heon!”\n“Teacher!”\nIt was Hu Bong. Then, he saw Chun Yeowun and Ark Young.\nWhen Bi Mak-heon was puzzled at the new face, Hu Bong answered with a smile.\n“Lord’s disciple.”\n“Disciple? Huh? A disciple?”\nBi Mak-heon was startled. Not just anyone’s, but Chun Yeowun’s? It was impossible to not feel envy when this new man was going to be the disciple of the great leader of the Sky Demon Order.\n“I am Ark Young. It is embarrassing, but I am being guided by Teacher.”\nArk Young greeted them. Both the women were a bit shocked at his way of speaking.\n“Ready?”\nChun Yeowun asked them. Yu So-hwa placed the coat she had prepared for Chun Yeowun on his shoulders and said.\n“The car is ready out…”\n-Take your hand off.\n‘!?’\nYu So-hwa was puzzled at it. She didn’t know where this came from. At that moment, Chun Yeowun pulled something out, a cute baby fox with golden fur. Yu So-hwa, who was putting the coat on, loved it.\n“Oh my!”\nIm So-hye too watched it.\n“Vice-chairman, what is this? When did you bring such a cute ki…”\nBite!\n“Ack!”\nAs she tried to stroke the put, the fox bit Im So-hye’s finger. And it was not just a painful bite, but one that drew blood.\n-Where do you think you are putting your hand?\n“Huh?”\nWhen the fox spoke, both women wouldn’t hide their shock. To those who didn’t know she was a yokai, the fox cub’s ability to speak human language was enough to shock them.\nHu Bong warned them.\n“Even if it looks like that, I recommend you to not touch it.”\n“W-what are you saying! This thing bit me!”\nIm So-hye was angry at Hu Bong, so he asked why she was getting pissed at him.\nSwish!\nThe fox moved from his hands and walked onto Chun Yeowun’s shoulder. And warned both women.\n-Chun Ma is mine. Don’t touch me carelessly.\nThe way she wiggled her seven tails was cute, but it wasn’t so cute for Im So-hye, who got her finger bitten.\n“V-Vice chairman… she… she what is it?”\n“Don’t mind it. As Hu Bong said, don’t touch it.”\nChun Yeowun wasn’t the kind to explain things.\n-Hear that? Hear that?\nThe fox moved from the right shoulder to the left, and left to right. Only later, through Ark Young, did they learn that the fox was a great Yokai, the golden-haired nine tailed fox.\nIn the sedan waiting outside, they moved to the Hayden Hotel. On the way, Chun Yeowun looked at the information prepared.\nThe hotel was a 5 star hotel famous for its designation as a black market. It was an old hotel, over 100 years old.\n“Politicians, famous journalists, as well as foreign investors often use it. Quite an unexpected place.”\nChoosing a hotel that was quite open to many people was strange.\n“Maybe they aimed to stay under the darkness of the lamp.”\nThe hotel was quite a long distance away, and they arrived about an hour and a half later. As is the case with most hotel arrivals, a valet in red opened the door.\n“Hm.”\nChun Yeowun, who got out, looked around. Numerous strong energy sources could be felt.\n“Ha. From the yellow-haired punks to a lot more.”\nHu Bong said it. Undoubtedly, there were a lot of foreigners here.\n“Teacher. Those people… aren’t ordinary ones.”\nArk Young, standing next to Chun Yeowun, pointed to a few. Their nationality was hard to tell, but they seemed quite strong and had a unique energy.\n“Right.”\n“They must be foreign talented people or warriors of their place.”\nBi Mak-heon asked,\n“Foreign talented people?”\n“I heard that there are people with special martial arts or skills or talents in other nations like ours. And I heard that they try everything to save their own nations.”\nIt was impossible for just one place to have martial arts, as other places should have their own way of martial arts when it came to fighting. Considering the warriors of India he had met, Chun Yeowun knew that strong people existed in other nations too.\n“Shall we head in?”\nThey still had two hours more to spare. Chun Yeowun wanted to check in and then look around.\nAfter passing through the revolving door, a large lobby emerged into view.\nHowever, strange words appeared.\n“このやろ! この方が誰か知っているのか.”\nThe characters were weird, causing Bi Mak-heon to frown.\n“Seems to be Japanese.”\n“Japanese?”\nHu Bong didn’t know the myriad of languages in this world. At that, Bi Mak-heon frowned and said,\n“A nation to the east.”\nAt that, Hu Bong clicked his tongue like he understood it.\n“Ah! Those ones! Such a nuisance wherever they went.”\nEven in Chun Yeowun’s times, there were frequent incidents where pirates from Japan attacked the villages on shore.\nThis was why Chinese people hated the Japanese. Of course, not just that, as there were lots of reasons why the two nations didn’t like each other.\nIn an instant, the Japanese language patch was added to Chun Yeowun’s mind, allowing him to pick up what the Japanese at the desk were saying.\n“Do you know who this man is? This is Kenji-san, the vice-boss of Odagum who inherited the samurai lineage in the Kansai region.”\nThe man shouted while pointing to a middle-aged man with pointed eyes, a gray kimono, a blade, and sunglasses.\nIn the hotel, an employee wearing a white bow tie spoke in firm Japanese.\n“Sorry. You won’t be able to check in without an invitation card.”\n“Ha!”\nThe man seemed frustrated at this mess. At that, Kenji reached out, trying to stop him, and said.\n“The invitation was stolen on the ship, so what do you want me to do?”\n“Sorry.”\nThe attitude of the hotel staff was still adamant.\nStroking his chin while glaring at the hotel staff, the one named Kenji said.\n“I just need to have an invitation?”\n“… yes.”\nIn response to that, Kenji looked at the tall man with long hair in black kimono next to him.\n“Did you hear that, Tanaka?”\n“Yes. I will take care of it.”\nWith an answer, the one called Tanaka looked around. And looked at Chun Yeowun and his companions who were walking to the desk. Seeing the sword on Hu Bong’s waist, Tanaka smiled and gestured something which made a group of six men in suits follow him.",

      "content": "Chapter 152: Hayden Hotel (2)\nThe man named Tanaka and six other men in suits stood in the way, naturally attracting all the attention of people in the lobby.\n“Huh? Why are these bastards blocking our path?”\nHu Bong asked with an annoyed expression. Tanaka, who stood in the way, spoke in Chinese despite the subtle hints of a Japanese accent.\n“Did you come here with an invitation?”\n“What are you talking about?”\nLooking at the sword on Hu Bong’s waist, Tanaka asked,\n“Are you a samurai?”\nSamurai was a word meaning warrior. Hu Bong responded to Tanaka with a harsh tone.\n“Move it.”\n“Give me the invitation.”\n“What?”\n“If not, then...”\nAs Tanaka gestured, the men in black suits began to move, taking poses for normal karate but concentrating a certain energy around their hands. It was difficult to tell if it was internal energy, but they definitely dealt with a special energy.\n“You will regret this.”\nIt meant that the invitation would be taken by force. The golden fox just yawned as it looked at the six men and Tanaka's smiling expression.\n-\nYawn!\nInterestingly, no one in the lobby wanted to get involved. Instead, they would rather—\nShhh!\nTanaka held out his hand.\n“I’ll let you make the first move.”\nThe atmosphere became weird. How would this situation turn out? Seeing Hu Bong, one of Chun Yeowun’s party, wield a sword, everyone assumed that they would begin fighting.\n“Annoying.”\nChun Yeowun ignored that and tried to walk ahead to the desk.\n“このやろ!”\n[This man!]\nTanaka's expression hardened at Chun Yeowun’s actions and tried to pull out the blade on his waist.\nThud!\n“Kuak!”\nTanaka’s knees bent and hit the floor. Flustered, he tried to stand up, but he couldn’t budge under the tremendous energy.\n‘What the hell is this?’\nWhile Tanaka barely managed to lift his head, he looked at the woman who was looking down at him while pressing down her palms. She was Yu So-hwa, the infamous Gravity Witch.\n“You arrogant bitch!”\n“Haaa!”\nSix men in black suits ran towards her, but Yu So-hwa just reached out her other hand and lowered it.\nThud! Thud! Thud!\n“Kuak!”\n“Ack!”\n“H-How?”\nThey too fell on the floor. Because many powerful people appeared after her within the Sky Demon Order, she didn’t get to show off her skills often, but she was still one of the only three SS class keepers.\nYu So-hwa asked Chun Yeowun in a polite manner,\n“Can I deal with him? Vice-chairman?”\n“Just in moderation.”\n“Sure.”\nYu So-hwa lowered her palm further, causing the bodies to penetrate into the marble floor.\nShhhh!\nSeeing this occurrence, many people in the lobby spoke in surprise.\n“That woman… isn’t she the Gravity Witch?”\n“Gravity Witch, Yu So-hwa!”\n“What? The SS-class keeper?”\nAmong the people with abilities, she was the top. Seeing how the Japanese people went against her, the observers thought that the men were done. However, someone came shooting at Yu So-hwa.\nShhh!\nHe was Suzushi, the right hand of Kenji. He was a samurai who ranked in the top three of the Odagumi, and, in deciding that Tanaka and the others were done for, moved to save his comrades. The speed at which he moved was quite quick.\nHowever,\nWheik!\n“Ack?”\nSuzushi’s body floated to the ceiling in a tornado gust. Im So-hye was wriggling her fingers as she clicked her tongue.\n“Tch.”\nSuzushi held onto the ceiling to make sure he didn’t move further. He tried to kick the ceiling and move to Im So-hye, but…\nWheik!\nThe wind created a tremendous pressure impelling things to fly his way and people shouted again.\n“Im So-hye the Red Wind!”\nPeople called her Red Wind because she always had red lipsticks and red clothes on. There are only three people at the SS-class keeper level, and two of them were here.\n“Two SS-class keepers?”\n“W-what the hell is this? Gate keepers?”\nOnly a few people knew that they quit as Keepers to become the secretaries of Chun Yeowun; all they knew was that they had quit as keepers.\n‘Phew, I can’t let her have the spotlight.’\nThe human mind is very intriguing. She had no motivation to work for Chun Yeowun, but she didn’t want to fall behind Yu So-hwa.\n“W-what are they?”\nKenji couldn’t hide his shock. The warriors that he brought with himself were the best of Japan, but even they couldn’t go against these people.\n‘Where did he find such monsters…’\nShh!\n‘!?’\nKenji’s face went stiff at the cold blade which touched his neck. In front of him was a man with red hair: Hu Bong.\n“Eh... You. Are you the boss?”\nKenji, who couldn’t speak Chinese, just nodded, knowing that any more actions and his neck would be cut.\n“Final warning. Stop messing around and get out or you’ll regret it.”\n“W-what?”\n“You see him?”\nHu Bong asked by showing him Chun Yeowun.\n“He is my Lord. You should be grateful that I am one here with the blade. If it was him, you would have lost your arm or even your jaw.”\nRecently, Chun Yeowun had been ripping up more jaws than arms. A man could live with a missing arm, but could not with a missing jaw.\nCreepy!\nKenji felt goosebumps rise on his body and nodded. It was impossible to win over these people.\n“Then go back to your island.”\nAt that, Kenji shouted to his men.\n“Withdraw!”\nWith that, he tried to move away fast to hide his face. And both the secretaries called back their abilities to let the other men run off too.\n-Hmm, pretty good.\nThe golden-haired Gumiho on Chun Yeowun’s shoulder thought. She had seen many people over the years, so she knew that Chun Yeowun’s secretaries weren’t normal.\n-Well. Kids, but good. Right? Chun Ma? Clap! Clap!\nThe fox licked Chun Yeowun’s neck with its tongue, to which he pushed the bridge of her nose.\nPak!\n-Ah!\n“Disgusting.\"\n-You are being too much!\nShe screamed and went into his hands. To try and act cute but nothing worked on him. Kenji, who was running away, kept his head down, causing him to run into someone at the entrance.\n‘Huh?’\nSuddenly, he lowered his head and saw something – the clutch bag he cherished and in which he had placed the invitation card. Since it was a clutch bag made in France, he could never not recognize it, as it was the only one of its kind in the world.\n“You were the one!”\nKenji was convinced that the person had his bag, which was either lost or stolen. Kenji grabbed it and tried to use his blade.\nPapak!\nAt that moment, his body plummeted to the floor. Shocking members of his drew their swords, but.\nPapapak!\nIn the blink of an eye, 12 people collapsed. The eyes of the people in the lobby went towards the scene.\nAt the entrance was a middle-aged man with a mustache and sunglasses with a dark hood over his head. He seemed so relaxed that it was hard to tell whether he was the cause of the uproar.\nBut, people began to call out his name.\n“Oh my…. Kohaku!”\n“Kohaku!”\nHearing that, Chun Yeowun looked at the middle-aged man. He could feel great energy coming from him. No one else in the lobby was as strong as him.\n“Teacher. He is… really strong.”\nArk Young said with a startled look. If he, a Supreme Master, was saying it, then Kohaku had to be strong. Bi Mak-heon, who knew about him, said,\n“Vice-chairman. That person is Kohaku of Speed.”\n“Speed?”\n“He is the best warrior in Japan.”\n“The best?”\nIt wasn’t like Bi Mak-heon knew everything about foreign affairs, but he still made sure to keep track of the names that circulated often. And since Japan was known to have more talented people, he made sure to know about them.\nKohaku of Speed was said to be at the pinnacle of Godspeed, and to be the best in the Kanto region.\n“That one looks strong. The Lord can take him down instantly. Hehe.”\nHu Bong said. As long as a warrior was fighting against Chun Yeowun, he would always feel sympathy for them.\n“Hmm.”\nKohaku went past the Odagumi members and entered the lobby. He turned to Hu Bong and Ark Young, and he raised his sunglasses with two fingers to get a good look at the strong men.\n“He is looking at you, Lord.”\n“Not interested.”\nOf course, unlike them, Chun Yeowun lost interest.\nIt was weird to him that these people were coming here for an auction.\n‘What kind of auction is this?’\nHe was skeptical, but he would find out when it was time. Chun Yeowun went to the desk, took out his invitation card, and handed it over.\n“How many people are staying?”\n“6.”\nConfirming that, the hotel staff asked him to sign documents and handed them key cards. There were a total of two cards, divided into rooms for men and women. He hadn’t even thought about staying at the hotel but was actually being given a room.\nHe turned away when the desk staff called for him.\n“Wait a minute, customer.”\n“Hm?”\nThe staff went to the back of the desk, pulling out a cage for dogs and cats.\nThe staff pointed to the fox on his arms and said.\n“Hotel rules, sir. The pets need to be kept in cages.”\n‘!?'\nThe fox glared but no one even looked at it. The great yokai was being treated as a domesticated pet.\nThe inside of the hotel room on the 15th floor was gorgeous. There wasn’t a single thing that wasn’t luxurious in it, from antique furniture to leopard carpets to a minibar. Not to mention, the huge 100-inch TV.\n“Wow! This cannot be compared to anything I have seen.”\nHu Bong looked around in admiration, which was shown for every place he visited.\nShhh!\nUnlike Hu Bong, Bi Mak-heon , upon entry, took out a device from his bag and searched the room.\n“Mak-heon what are you doing?”\n“I am checking to see if there are any cameras or wiretapping devices here.”\nHe knew what kind of group the MS group was from Chun Yeowun, so he was checking in advance since they seemed like a shady group of people. He handed this job to the secretaries, who began checking the room.\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun looked at the door.\nBelatedly, Hu Bong and Ark Young looked at it and frowned.\nBang! Bang!\nSomeone kept banging on the door. When he looked at Bi Mak-heon and nodded, Bi Mak-heon went to open it. However, he ended up flying across the other side of the room.\nThud!\nBlood gushed out of his mouth as he barely managed to stand. He received a blow to the chest and suffered internal injuries instantly as two men walked through the door. The person at the forefront was the one who attacked, a middle-aged man with yellow hair and exotic appearance.\n“Я наконец вижу вас, ребята!”\nHe came in saying something harshly; while no one else could understand it, Chun Yeowun could.\n“I’m finally able to meet you guys.”\nWhen he realized that the Ice Cold Staff went to Russian, Chun Yeowun asked Nano to feed the language. The language recognition let Chun Yeowun figure out that this man was Russian.\nAs if looking at the enemy, the Russian man glared at Chun Yeowun and the others and shouted.\n“You are the group of murderers who killed Prime Minister Agonov and our other politicians.”\nChun Yeowun frowned.\nThis man seemed to be talking about the incident that occured 27 years ago. At that time, Chun Woo-jin was the Lord and was accused of committing the slaughter of everyone at a diplomatic meeting, which included the President of China and the Prime Minister of Russia. It was recently revealed that the indictment was wrong, but this man’s reaction meant that he was ignorant.\n“What is this bastard saying!”\nHu Bong began to get angry on the behalf of Bi Mak-heon. The man behind the Russian opened his mouth.\n“Подождите секунду.”\n[Stop.]\nAt this, the Russian turned back with an anguished face as the person behind him stepped ahead.\nA woman in her late 20s with glasses and curly hair in a neat suit appeared as she bowed and apologized.\n“Sorry. I didn’t expect Mersen to be so agitated about the past.”\n“Mersen?”\nBi Mak-heon looked at the Russian with an expressionless face, to which Chun Yeowun asked.\n“Mak-heon, is this someone you know?”\n“That man, Mersen Agonov, is a warrior and member of the Russian Federation.”\nMersen Agonov, a cousin of Agonov, was the last prime minister of the Russian federation and one of the best warriors in Russia.\nHe was known to be a monster unmatched in close combat and Sambo, a Russian martial art. He shed a lot of blood in the name of revenge as he searched for the members of Sky Demon Order.\n“I thought they disappeared and returned back to their land.”\nHe didn’t expect to meet the man here. Along with the Murim Association, it was difficult for the Cult to form because Mersen kept hunting down members.\n“What good would talking with this disgusting bastard do?”\nMersen asked in an enraged voice to which the woman said.\n“Поскольку переговоры еще не закончились, Пожалуйста, подождите”\n[Wait until everything is decided.]\n“Чего вы ждете? Я убью немедленно!”\n[Wait for what! I will kill them right away!]\n“Ждите шанса. Пожалуйста, подождите.”\n[I will give you the chance so wait.]\nAt her words, Mersen stepped back. However, he showed a gesture of sliding his thumb by the neck. The woman smiled and spoke.\n“Sorry. I felt like bringing him in as a guard. There are very few talented people these days, so please understand…”\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun moved to Mersen. Surprised by the approach that happened in the blink of an eye, Mersen tried to hit back.\nPak!\n“What?”\nCrack!\n“Kuak!”\nChun Yeowun grabbed the wrist of Mersen, who was unfolding Sambo, and broke it.\nIt was unusual for Mersen, a master in Sambo but it didn’t end there. Chun Yeowun then grabbed his head.\nGrab!\nThe woman screamed.\n“W-what are you doing?’\nChun Yeowun spoke in a dry voice.\n“What were you thinking, bringing in this piece of shit?”\n“Huh?”\nPush!\n“Kuaaal!”\nAs soon as he said that, Chun Yeowun began to push his head down. Mersen ended up breaking his own neck as his head reached the torso, causing his spine to protrude out as he fell.\n‘N-No!’\nThe woman couldn’t hide her shock. Mersen was one of the three top warriors in Russia. At that level, she thought no one could touch her or the man, but now he had become a chunk of meat in seconds.\nTo her, who knew nothing, Chun Yeowun said.\n“A chance to kill? What a funny wench you are.”\n‘!?’\nHer face turned pale. She never fathomed that anyone in the room could understand the conversation they had in Russian.",

      "content": "Chapter 153: Hayden Hotel (3)\n‘Indeed, as expected from Chun Ma!’\nBi Mak-heon exclaimed inwards. Mersen was so absurdly put down and killed like he was weak. He along with many other sects had gone after the Sky Demon Order’s clans that were scattered and tried to kill them, but he had now been defeated without a fight. The curly-haired woman, who seemed to be Russian, spoke in shock.\n“W-wait. I really didn’t mean…”\nPuck!\n“Kuaak!”\nChun Yeowun grabbed her by the back of her neck, threw her into the room, and then closed the door.\nBang!\nShe rolled on the floor and looked at Chun Yeowun in fear.\n‘He is more dangerous than I expected.’\nThe information she had said that he was one of the Five Great Warriors of China, so she thought that Mersen, rated one of the top three in Russia, would be able to handle him.\nChun Yeowun walked into the room and sat on the sofa as he said.\n“Tell me.”\n“Huh?”\n“Why did you come here?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, she became restless. The pressure that she could die any moment made her unable to open her mouth.\n“If you don’t open your mouth…”\nWhen Chun Yeowun raised his hand, the woman spoke in a hurry.\n“I-I am here to negotiate.”\n“Negotiate?”\n“Yes.”\nHu Bong clicked his tongue at her words.\n“These days, negotiation seems to start with force. So bloody.”\nThere was nothing to be said. At first, she should have exerted more control over Mersen, but chose to allow the man to alone try and corner the other party into accepting her terms.\n“Did MS send you?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s question, she waved her hand and said,\n“Ah- No!”\n“Then?”\nHe thought that she was sent by the MS Group, but Chun Yeowun didn’t show off any expression. If not, then who was this woman?\nShe answered him promptly.\n“I am Tuan from the East Asia Union.”\nEast Asia Union?\nHe looked at Bi Mak-heon, who shook his head, meaning that he knew nothing about this.\n“Doesn’t seem like an official organization.”\nThe name was the East Asia Union, but there was a high probability of it being a private organization. She even said her name, but it wasn’t like her name was ever mentioned in China.\n[As a result of analyzing her way of pronunciation, she is presumed to be Mongolian.]\nNano spoke in his head. As expected, she wasn’t from China. As she had brought in Russian warriors, it was plausible to believe that she was actually from the East Asia Union.\n“And what does that group want?”\n“… that…”\nBecause there was no one to save her, she couldn’t just speak out confidently, which made Chun Yeowun believe that turning her into a ghost would be more effective.\nIt was then.\nPick!\nThe 100-inch TV screen turned on, but no one in the room had pressed anything. The screen whirred to life, and the speakers too, as a video began playing.\nCkick!\nA person wearing a black mask, showing only his eyes, appeared on the white screen. The masked man bowed his head.\n-It is an honor to meet the vice-chairman of the Yongchun Group, the most famous group in recent times. My name is\nI\n, the head of Sector 9 of MS Group.\nThe voice identified himself as\nI\n, using an altered voice. Measures were taken to make sure they couldn’t be identified.\nSince it wasn’t known when the video was recorded and being played, Bi Mak-heon approached the TV dubiously.\n-We apologize in advance for greeting you with a recorded video.\nShowing a recorded video meant they were trying to avoid being tracked, at which Chun Yeowun snorted.\n“Huh.”\nIt seemed like the MS Group learned new tricks to avoid being figured out. As if they were afraid of being pursued.\n-The fact that this video is being played means, as expected, the vice-chairman has received this invitation from one of our Guests.\n“They noticed that.”\nBi Mak-heon said it to Chun Yeowun. This was something they were already guessing about. They didn’t think that they’d allow just anyone with an invitation to come in.\n-I’ve heard from some sector heads that we’ve had a bad mix-up lately, and I apologize again.\nThe masked man bowed again and got up.\n-We are trying to rectify what happened. Please accept our small token of sincerity.\nA bell sounded from outside the room. Shortly after, a knock on the door. As Bi Mak-heon flinched because he was attacked the last time the door was answered, Hu Bong decided to go now.\n“Eh?”\nIt was a hotel staff. Hu Bong tried reading his energy, and the man turned out to be an ordinary human.\n“What?”\n“A guest has asked me to bring this to room 1504 in the morning.”\nThe staff handed it over and left. Hu Bong, who was holding this bag, brought it to Chun Yeowun with a puzzled look.\n-The password is 492390,\nThe masked man said, and when the number was put in, the bag opened. But the moment it was opened, Bi Mak-heon was shocked.\n“Wow!”\nIn the bag were dozens of diamonds. With this number of diamonds, the monetary value was astronomical.\n“Insane!”\nBi Mak-heon was speechless. He didn’t know what was happening. The masked man continued to speak.\n-I understand that you are in need of money because of the recent merger. We hope this helps.\nBi Mak-heon frowned at it. The merger was being done as silently as possible. Of course, he knew the experts on the financial side would have noticed it, but these people seemed to be paying close attention to the Sky Demon Order.\n-Of course, I don’t think that the vice-chairman's anger can be solved with just this, but I hope that it at least helps in restoring our relationship.\n“You seemed to have used a lot of your brain.”\nChun Yeowun clicked his tongue. These people didn’t know why he was looking for them.\n-It is an honor to know you will be attending the auction hosted by us. We hope you have a great time.\nThe masked man kept continuing to speak, as if he was trying his best to improve their relationship. At that, a CG photo was displayed on the top right corner. The photo was,\n“Lord, that’s…”\nIt was a bottle with the blood of the Flame Qilin.\n-I’ll give you the gist of our offer. I am sure that you would be aware and would like to know if you would like to do business with us.\nThere was something this man still wanted, as he kept showing the bottle that looked identical to the one at Hu Bong’s site.\n-We are willing to buy this for a thousand gold. Or, we are open to exchanging it with anything physical you want. Now that you have this bottle in your hand, I am sure you know what it is and its side effects as well.\nSpirit beast blood was difficult to absorb. And its side effect was death if the person couldn’t handle it.\n-We have succeeded in eliminating the side effects with our technology, so if you would like to do business with us, we can refine it and hand it back to you. Please consider it.\n‘Without side effects?’\nDid they figure out a way to take in the blood? Still, it meant nothing to Chun Yeowun.\nEven without their skills, he could help others also absorb the blood.\n-If you want to make a deal, please present the VIP invitation to the driver at 7 pm. I hope we have a nice meeting.\nWith that, the video ended.\n“VIP invitation? Driver?”\nHe wasn’t sure what it was, when Bi Mak-heon found something in the bag.\n“This was inside.”\nIt was a card along with diamonds. Unlike the normal card, this one was in diamond. And the VIP was engraved in the center.\n‘Ah!’\nThe eyes of Tuan of East Asia Union shone at the card, as the task she was given was to get that invitation.\nAfter receiving information that Chun Yeowun might get the VIP invitation, she came to negotiate.\n“You seem interested in this.”\n“… yes.”\n“Can you guess what my answer will be?”\nAt his question, Tuan bit her lip. It was dangerous to say anything without her men.\n“What does the East Asian Union want?”\n“… we…”\n-Sorry, Tuan\nIt was a subtle sound, but Chun Yeowun heard it. When he looked into her ear, he noticed a tiny wireless earphone.\nTuan was shocked at the message.\nTang!\nAt that moment, something pierced into the hotel room’s window.\nChik!\nThere was a sound of something moving. Tuan turned to see a very long bullet suspended in mid-air.\n“W-what is this?”\nWheik!\nThe spinning bullet was sucked into someone’s hand. It was Chun Yeowun. He looked at the direction of the bullet. Where the hole was from, it was from a high rise building 400 meters away.\n“So they’re there?”\nChun Yeowun flicked the bullet with his finger.\nPhat!\nThe ponytail sniper watching the hotel room couldn’t believe his eyes.\n‘Is he looking at me? From 400 meters away?’\nIt was then.\nPak!\n“Kuak!”\nSomething pierced his shoulder.\nHis eyes trembled at it.\n‘A sniper bullet?’\nHe didn’t see any sniper rifles around. The only thing he saw was someone snap the finger.\n‘N-No!’\nIt was absurd. That man controlled a bullet and shot it with a snap?\n“Kuak… damn it!”\nEither way, the mission failed. He hurriedly put the sniper into his bag and was ready to get away.\n“He is running away. Hu Bong, catch him.”\n“Yes Lord!”\nCrack!\nHu Bong broke through the window and flew out. In less than three minutes, the sniper was dangling in his hand.\n“Cycoon!”\nTuan recognized him. She didn’t think that a sniper that far away could be caught and retrieved, but the condition of the man, Cycoon, was just as strange.\n“Uh? Lord. This man seems weird… uh? Poison?”\nBeing caught, the man was ready to die.\n‘Ahh.’\nTuan shook her head. This measure was to prevent leaking information to them. Chun Yeowun placed his hand on Cycoon's head.\n‘What is he doing?’\nTuan was puzzled when a gloomy blue light flashed from his palm. And then soon, the skin of her ally changed to white.\nShhh!\n‘!?’\nAnd something creeped up.\n“Kyaaak!”\nTuan screamed in fright. A Ghost with Cycoon’s form appeared in front of her, and Chun Yeowun then touched the ghost.\nPsss!\nThe head trembled and everything he thought before he died moved into Chun Yeowun. The man, Cycoon, was talking in English.\n[Will the negotiation go through?]\n[I wish for our success this time. If you miss the timing, we will miss their tracks once again. We need to reclaim the stolen goods.]\n[\nSigh\n. But wouldn’t it be better to send Amuchai instead of Mersen? Mersen loses his mind when it comes to Demonic Cult.]\n[Amuchai is a secret power.]\n[But…]\n[Stop. I know Tuan is your friend but this job is important. In the event that the negotiation fails, Mersen’s experience as a great warrior of Sambo is perfect for killing the opponent. Things will turn into a mess if the God of Killing, Amuchai, steps ahead.]\nAt the word of Amuchai, fear and awe could be felt in Cycoon’s emotional state.\n[Alright.]\nNot long after, he noticed the problem, and reported.\n[Mersen seems to have been hit!]\n[… Kill Tuan.]\n[Huh?]\n[If the Yongchun has any relations with MS, we will be revealed. We need to stop that.]\nHe could feel the Cycoon’s agony. Like Tuan, he was also Mongolian.\nIt seemed painful for him to kill someone of the same ethnicity, but he had no choice.\n[Sorry. Tuan.]\nHis memories after that were of the shooting and being captured. It was unfortunate that the earphone was broken in the process of escaping.\n‘This much only?’\nChun Yeowun put his hand away and then held out the wristguard, which sucked in the Ghost.\n“W-what did you do?”\nTuan stepped back with trembling hands. She felt terrified by this man who could handle Ghosts. In response, Chun Yeowun said.\n“We have the same goal.”\n“What?”\nFrom what he understood, these people hated MS too, and were trying to reclaim stolen goods.\n“Is your goal to retake what the MS Group has stolen?”\n“H-How did you know about that?”\nShe couldn’t figure it out, Chun Yeowun said.\n“I also have something to take back from them.”\n“Ah!”\nAt those words, Tuan’s eyes fluttered. She remembered the video talking about a not-so-good relationship between the Yongchun and MS Groups.\nMoreover, this man here seemed to share the same purpose as EAU.\nCautiously, she tried to persuade him.\n“Enemy of an enemy is an ally. If you, the vice chairman, have the same purpose as us, how about joining hands for both of our benefits…”\nGrab!\n“Kuak!”\nBefore she could finish her words, Chun Yeowun grabbed her neck and spoke in a cold voice.\n“Would an ally kill you if necessary?”\n“Kuak… kua… p… please…”\n“Want to live?”\nAt his question, Tuan nodded her head.\n“Then tell me who is involved in the EAU and where they are hiding.”\nShe was terrified of revealing the information. She wasn’t sure, but it looked like this man could kill them all.\nNormally, she would have sacrificed herself to keep it a secret, but now, for the first time, she was actually scared of death.\n“I-I will tell you everything.”",

      "content": "Chapter 154: Auction House Onboard (1)\nThere was a dark space in virtual reality, with nothing but chairs.\nTen people wearing masks were seated, with the letters from the alphabet written on the forehead of their masks from ‘A’ to ‘J’.\nThe person wearing the mask with the letter ‘D’ looked at\nI\nand asked,\n“Did we have to be that irrational with our request?”\n“Right now, the Yongchun Group is very popular, and there are quite a few people who consider them as heroes.”\nG\nfurthered the point that\nI\nwas making.\n“He has a point. Since the TRA crisis was resolved in no time, their influence increased. If this is their asset, then they are very valuable.”\nA picture of Chun Yeowun floated in the middle.\nE\n, who was watching it, asked.\n“What do we do if things don’t go our way? We have a huge number of VIP guests attending this auction.”\nNo one wanted to mistreat any VIP guests, as each of them had enormous wealth. At that,\nC\nlaughed.\n“Puahahahaha!”\n“… Are you laughing right now?”\n“Your jokes are too much.”\n“Jokes?”\n“Do you think the VIPs are there because of their wealth? Worrying about them is ridiculous.”\nB\n, who was next to him spoke,\n“You are speaking as if you don’t know. It is because a mess turns bigger if those rich VIPs go wild.”\nThe air around became tense, as despite being in the same group, they were competitive. As a result, each of the members kept the others in check.\n“Haha… is this going to happen again? I heard that more than 30% of our original traders changed.”\nF\n, who seemed to be a woman, changed the topic. The change of more than 30% of the original traderse meant that the invitations had been transferred.\nI\nnodded in reply.\n“Among those, we have Kohaku of Speed, God of Killing Amuchai, and Holy Sword Jack Oren.”\n“Japan, Thailand and England… they haven’t come out till now. They have begun to move at last.”\nB\nseemed interested. The people who were mentioned were the strongest in their respective nations.\n“Is it because of that?”\n“Has to be.”\nSuch people wanted to participate in the highlight of the auction.\n“Thanks to that, we will have quite an entertainment.”\nMost of them in masks agreed to it, but D-mask mumbled.\n“If only the problem were resolved, I would have gone and watched it in person.”\n“Watch the live broadcast then.”\n“Tch. As if I have a choice.”\nThanks to the change in topic by\nF\n, the atmosphere changed. People began to leave the virtual meeting until\nA\nand\nI\nwere the last two remaining.\n“I will now disconnect to prepare for the auction–”\n“Wait.”\nA\n, who hadn’t said a word since then, spoke. It wasn’t an annoying voice, but it was strangely harsh.\nChik!\nAs soon as he said that, the virtual space changed. The scene was blocked from the eyes of the other masks, and only some of the masks could hear.\n“Take care of Chun Mu-seong at the auction house.”\n“Huh?”\nI\ncouldn’t hide his confusion. They were intending to make him a VIP, so he couldn’t understand his orders.\n“But he…”\n“As a result of the data calculated, the probability of him rejecting our offer is over 98.3%. He will not come outside.”\n“Didn’t we think of a reason and decide to bring him to our side using the gift and the VVIP card to avoid that?”\nThe decision had already been made. However, there was a piece of information meant for only one mask.\n“Among the ten, there is a leaker.”\n“Huh?”\n“Did you think that the change in the original guests was normal?”\n“Then… you think we have a leaker?”\nI\n’s voice became heavy. This wasn’t an easy task.\n“A lot of VVIPs and VIP guests were being handled by that mask and will even try to contact this man, Chun Mu-seong.”\n“… We don’t know who the leaker is?”\n“It has to be one of the masks participating in the entertainment.”\nAt that,\nI\n’s eyes trembled. There were three people at the table, including him, who decided to participate in the entertainment, meaning he too was under suspicion.\n“… Am I under suspicion too?”\n“Do you want to prove your loyalty?”\n“…”\n“Get Chun Mu-seong and get rid of him.”\nHe had no choice but to do it to avoid suspicion and follow his leader’s,\nA\n’s, words.\n“I understand.”\n7 pm.\nNumerous sedans were lined up in front of the hotel. All the auction participants with invitations came down and waited in the lobby, and once their name was called out, they would get into the sedan.\n“So the auction isn’t here.”\nChun Yeowun nodded at Bi Mak-heon’s words. That was why they said to hand over the VIP invitation to the driver.\n“Then it seems like the auction house is split in two. Shall we do as discussed before?”\nThere were two types of invitations. General and VIP one.\n“Ah!”\nHu Bong had a sad expression. It was because in the event of two auctions, he would enter the General one with Bi Mak-heon and Im So-hye to find traces of Baekgi.\nThis was because only him and Chun Yeowun knew how Baekgi looked.\n“Guest Amuchai.”\nWhen someone called out the name, the people In the lobby gasped.\n‘Amuchai?’\nChun Yeowun looked at the person being called.\nHe heard this name in the most recent Ghost that he made. A sharp looking Thai man with brown skin and blue hair appeared.\n“God of Killing.”\nBi Mak-heon seemed shocked.\n“I didn’t even think that he would come here. In Thailand, he is called the God of Killing. He is the apex and unrivaled.”\nGod of Killing, Amuchai.\nA monster so strong that he had no enemies within his nation. Ark Young and Hu Bong asked,\n“Huh? Mak-heon, is he that strong?”\nThey couldn’t find anything special about him. In fact, it was difficult to read others since the kinds of martial arts were different for each nation.\nStep!\nAmuchai, who was called, passed by and stared at Chun Yeowun. He heard that Mersen had died at the hands of Chun Yeowun.\nHowever, he couldn’t take revenge on him.\n“?????????”\n[Cowardly bastard.]\nThe East Asia Union received Chun Yeowun’s message from Tuan, who returned alive: he wanted all the agents who infiltrated the auction house to refrain from causing friction with Chun Yeowun.\nAmuchai couldn’t understand the reason, but he decided that the moment the mission was done, he would kill Chun Yeowun with his own hands.\n“Guest Chun Mu-seong.”\nBefore long, his name was called.\n“Hu Bong. If there is a problem, let me know right away.”\n“Yes, my Lord.”\nChun Yeowun’s party, which was divided into two, moved. The sedan drove on the overpass for about 30 minutes and arrived at a port.\n“Huh?”\n-Huh? The smell of the sea wafted after a while.\nThe fox in Chun Yeowun’s hand poked its head out. The unique scent of the sea made it feel good. She felt like growling.\n‘This isn’t even a cat, what is this thing doing?’\n-Come to think of it, I had never been to the sea with your ancestor.\nThe golden fox looked at the sea with shimmering eyes, thinking of the past. The lights around the place made the sea shine. Just looking at the view was enjoyable.\n“This is my first time here, Teacher.”\nSurprisingly, it was Ark Young’s first time too. He had never been to any body of water before because he had always stayed in the Kunlun Mountains.\n“This way.”\nSince there were numerous ships in the port, the driver and an attendant in the front seat guided them on a speedboat. The speedboat was very fast.\n“It isn’t here?”\n“Ah! The auction house is over there.”\nThe attendant pointed to a small and sparkling thing over the sea. It was far enough to make it tough for humans to see.\n[Zoomed-in night vision mode activated.]\nWith the various functions in Nano, Chun Yeowun could see the huge ship floating in the middle of the ocean.\nThe auction was being held on a ship.\n‘I can’t attack or act out.’\nChun Yeowun thought about it, deciding that it didn’t mean much. The speedboat carrying the VIPs quickly crossed over and headed to the auction house on the ship.\nWhen viewed from a distance, its size looked normal, but up close, it was huge, like a ship made by weaving together several ships.\n‘Gorgeous.’\nIt wasn’t an exaggeration to say it looked like there was a Las Vegas on the ship, as there were lights all around and the splendid decoration.\nWheik!\nAs the auction was being held in the evening, the chefs were cooking in the open kitchen and the food was being served at a buffet. It seemed more like a festival.\nAnd then came an announcement.\n-VIP guests on the last speedboat, please come to the central dome where the auction is being held.\nThe center of the ship was crafted with an open ceiling.\nUpon entering, there were designated seats and in the center was a wide pedestal that rose about 2 meters high.\nAs the last people entered and took their seats, a man in a purple suit and purple mask walked up. The man grabbed the mic and spoke,\n-First of all, we would like to welcome all the VIP guests who have come here to the auction, which has resumed after a year.\nThe man in the mask seemed to be in charge of this auction. Chun Yeowun gave Nano an order.\n‘Nano. Analyze the voice.’\nChun Yeowun wanted to compare the person who appeared in the recorded video with an altered voice and this man to see if the people were the same.\n[The result from analyzing the tone and intonation pattern of the voice is negative.]\nThey weren’t the same person, as there was no way that the same man would come here.\nHowever, someone sat in the seat ahead of Chun Yeowun and started talking to him after turning his head a little.\n“You are the vice-chairman of Yongchun, right?”\nHe was a man in his 40s with a bald head and a wide smile. He reached out for a handshake.\n“I wanted to see you at least once, as it is such an honor.”\nChun Yeowun ignored the hand. The bald man lowered his hand, sighed, and talked again.\n“Perhaps I greeted you too openly? First time here? At the auction, I mean. I think it will be the third time for me.”\nDespite being ignored, the man continued to talk. Ark Young wasn’t his assistant, but he took the role and asked.\n“Do you have some business, sir?”\nAt that, the bald man waved his hand.\n“Hey, nothing like that. I was just trying to get acquainted with the vice-chairman of the Yongchun Group, who seems to be running a lot of things these days. Just wanted to form a relationship.”\nThere were a lot of people who had been doing this lately to Chun Yeowun, all because of his rise in fame.\n“If it’s fine with you, let’s have a drink and talk during the break…”\nJust as he was about to ask Chun Yeowun, the bald man stopped at what he heard the host say:\n-Prior to the full-scale auction, this time, I would like to take some time and boost the excitement. Those of you who know me, might know what I am saying.\n“What?”\nThe eyes of the bald man became sharp. He lost the smile he was trying to put on and turned his hand away.\n“I need to go away for a while. I will see you again later.”\nWith that, he tried to walk down stairs. Chun Yeowun, who had no interest in him, became suspicious of his last movements, and said to Ark Young,\n“Ark Young. Can you follow him and find out who he is contacting?”\n“Yes, teacher.”\nArk Young’s level would easily allow him to follow the man. As the bald man made his way towards the east exit of the dome, Ark Young trailed shortly behind.\nHe didn’t even have to use light steps because of the huge music and the noise around.\n“Damn it. What are they planning… putting the last thing first!”\nThe bald man kept muttering and headed somewhere. To the right of the exit at the east side was a hallway leading to a bathroom which he might enter.\n‘I need to keep my distance now.’\nBecause there were fewer people in here, Ark Young decided to stay a little farther away. so he proceeded slowly as the bald man passed by the bathroom and entered the warehouse with a sign saying “NO ENTRY”.\n‘Hmm.’\nArk Young was confused because there were security guards, who seemed strong, guarding in front of that warehouse.\nTaking them down wasn’t a problem, but it would create a mess with the CCTVs overflowing in this place. However, he was able to learn one thing.\n‘That man is involved in this.’\nOtherwise, there was no way he could freely enter this warehouse that was clearly saying no entry. Meanwhile he heard the cheers from the crowd in the dome.\n“Woahh!!!”\nPeople cheered because of the performance on the podium. An iron bar made of special alloy was cut.\n-See that? Watch the cutting of this special alloy rod.\nSwish!\nSomething black was spinning in the air above the podium. And then it stopped in front of the man in a black uniform on the podium.\nIt was a Wheel weapon made of black iron.\n-This is a weapon that we found in an old temple in the Yunnan Province.\nThe Ryun, or Wheel, floated in the air, but what was even more shocking was that this man in black wasn’t a warrior.\n-This mysterious weapon moves according to its owners' thoughts. The man here is an ordinary person who never learned martial arts, but the sharpness of this weapon allows him to cut down any metal or alloy.\n“Wow!”\nPeople shouted and applauded. Several people looked at it with greed in their eyes while the masked host continued.\n-This Wheel is being auctioned for an A class core. Anyone can become the owner of this wheel once the A class core is paid.\nYu So-hwa clicked her tongue at it. Although the weapon was strange, it was ridiculous to pay an A-class core for it.\nThis was literally an entertainment show.\n‘Who would go up and give an A-class core for such a thing and risk their life…?’\nYu So-hwa’s eyes widened.\n“V-Vice-chairman!”\nWas it Chun Yeowun who was walking up on the podium?",

      "content": "Chapter 155: Auction House Onboard (2)\nChun Yeowun wasn’t interested in the auction at first. However, he changed his mind after seeing the weapon that was shown, and it wasn’t the mysterious ability of the weapon he was interested in.\n‘To see this thing here.’\nThe weapon was called Wheel. It was none other than a weapon from Hagar’s blueprint of the armor suit. If his memory was correct, this wheel would turn into a helmet.\n‘This is what I want.’\nHe knew what an auction was and had to have the Wheel in his possession.\n“Woah!”\nThe people who saw him walk up the podium cheered. The vice-chairman of Yongchun Group, who recently gained a large name for himself, seemed to be interested in something.\n“Isn’t he the best in Murim?”\n“I heard that the Five Great Warriors are no match to him.\"\nTheir evaluation of his strength happened after the TRA incident, the biggest crisis of China. At that time, rumors spread that one of the Five Great Warrior’s couldn’t move against him in fear.\n“Is he the best?”\n“Er ist der berühmteste.”\n[It is said he is the best.]\nThe participants of other nations were interested in him too. Since most of them were participants in MS Groups, they were all related to arms, so keeping an eye out was natural.\nThe observation room on the top floor of the dome. There was a man in a dark suit looking at the podium, as smoke filled the room from the cigar he was biting. Suddenly, someone came in by slamming the door.\nBang!\n“\nI\n! No, Chae Mun-tak!”\nThe bald man who had approached Chun Yeowun suddenly arrived. The man with the cigar turned his body around at the mention of his name.\nChae Mun-tak’s eyes were very distinct. The right eye was blue and the left was red.\n“During work time, you're supposed to use my code name, Jay.”\nAt Chae Mun-tak’s words, the bald man, named Jay, spoke.\n“Is the code name the problem now? Why did you start with the entertainment?”\n“Is that the problem?”\n“The entertainment game is always supposed to be at the end, so why’d you change it suddenly?”\n“Be quiet.”\nTak!\nWhen Chae Mun-tak snapped his finger, all the attendants inside the room went out. Jay walked towards him.\n“What are you planning?”\n“Our leader noticed it.”\n“What?”\nJay’s face turned hard at that.\n“… Noticed it? What does that mean?”\n“As I said. Our leader found out that we had been working behind the scenes.”\nThe truth was revealed – there wasn’t just one defector.\nAmong the group, there was Jay, the bald man, and Chae Mun-tak, whose code name was\nI\n.\n“So, you changed the order so that the entertainment game would come first?”\nIf the show became overheated, an accident could occur, so it was usually placed last.\n“And the leader asked us to get rid of Chun Mu-seong.”\n“Chun Mu-seong? What?”\nThey were planning to form a relationship with Chun Mu-seong, knowing that things went wrong, Jay’s complexion darkened.\n“So you pushed the entertainment game forward? But how could a person with that level of fame participate in this show…?”\nJay unintentionally looked through the window and was shocked. He saw Chun Yeowun step up.\n“Wheel? Isn’t that something that would never come before the main event?”\nOriginally, it was a weapon priced at an S-rank core. Since it was something that any Murim would want, they never dreamed of putting it up before the main event.\n“Didn’t he come up?”\n“Are you thinking of using him for the entertainment game?”\n“We need to use such items for the monsters in each nation to move.”\nMore than half of the VIP people were not just wealthy but strong as well. It was no exaggeration to say that this place was full of superhumans. In particular, there were 6 strong people here who were known to be the strongest in their nations, so he knew that everyone would be vigilant.\n“But that doesn't mean they will come…. No!”\n“Come what? Ah!”\nChae Mun-tak couldn’t help but be shocked when another person climbed on the podium.\n-Finally, the first contenders of the entertainment game have been decided. They are Chun Mu-seong, the vice-chairman of Yongchun Group, and Jukwad Amuchai of Thailand!\nJukwad Amuchai was nicknamed the God of Killing. Among the people there, he was thought to be the strongest. There was a moment of silence before cheers erupted among the others.\n“Wow!”\nThe appearance of this monster, who was known to never have come down from the top position in Thailand for 24 years.\n“Crazy! He’s finally up!”\n“Will we see his strength?”\n“The strongest man in China vs. the strongest man in Thailand?”\nEveryone was excited. It was no longer just a game of entertainment. One couldn’t watch this game even if they paid billions.\n“… Unfortunate. We could have made money out of this.”\nChae Mun-tak put on a sad expression. This was an event they could have been paid enormously for if the broadcasting was sold on the black market. Jay raised his brows.\n“One of them will die.”\nChae Mun-tak nodded in agreement. The best scenario would be for Chun Yeowun to die. Of course, even if Chun Yeowun won, he would have to keep dealing with other contenders who wanted the weapon, building up his exhaustion.\n‘I am lucky.’\nA bearded man with his arms crossed, a blue hoodie, and sunglasses one welcomed the situation. He was Kohaku of Speed from Japan.\nIt would be a lie to say that he didn’t want the Wheel.\n‘We shook hands, Amuchai.’\nNot just Kohaku, but everyone in the place was watching it. This game was increasingly difficult for those who fought for the weapon earlier.\nTak!\nA man with a red coat, blonde hair, and a golden scabbard adorned with a splendid British Royal Pattern was also happy about it.\n‘The person considered the strongest has appeared first.’\nHe was Holy Sword Jack Oren of England. Although Chun Yeowun was the hottest topic these days, Amuchai had a reputation that preceded Chinese martial arts.\nThe audience all hoped that Chun Yeowun would die and Amuchai would be drained of strength at the end of the game.\n“?????????!”\n[I’ve been waiting for this moment!]\nAmuchai looked at Chun Yeowun, not believing that such a chance would come soon. Weapons were meaningless to Amuchai because he pursued martial arts using only his bare hands. All he wanted was revenge for his colleagues Mersen and Cycoon.\n-Let the entertainment game begin!\nAs soon as the masked man finished talking, a sound was played.\nPing!\nA strong energy formed at the edge of the podium and a barrier of membrane surrounding the podium came up.\n“Oh!”\n“Looks like a barrier.”\nThe people sitting were amazed at it. They realized that MS Group’s technological prowess was higher than that of others, and that this barrier was made to prevent the aftermath of the battle from reaching the others.\n“?????????????.”\n[This is just a toy!]\nAmuchai looked at the barrier surrounding him, and felt that he could break it with a little effort.\n-The barrier is designed to withstand the attacks of an A-class Alpha entity, so feel free to go all out.\n‘Huh! Indeed I will.’\nAmuchai kicked the barrier, and at that moment, a great wind pressure arose.\n-Pang! Bang!\nWhen the strong wind pressure that ripped even the air was sent, the entire ship shook.\nGrrr!\n“Oh!”\n“T-the ship is shaking!”\nThe crowd exclaimed at rumbling. However, what was more surprising was that the barrier was still intact. Because they were on a ship, the force couldn’t be absorbed entirely, but it was still greatly effective.\n‘I think it’ll be fine to use my full power.’\nAmuchai felt relieved at the thought. He was worried that the ship would break, but seeing the barrier work well, he could do his best.\n‘Amazing.’\nArk Young, who came after following the man called Jay, couldn’t help but be shocked at Amuchai’s kick.\n‘Without internal energy, it’s still that strong.’\nIt was just a basic kick with that much power. He couldn’t imagine what level would be reached if the man showed his true power. Amuchai glared at Chun Yeowun who was relaxed.\n“???????????.”\n[I’m going to kill you.]\n“Hmm.”\nChun Yeowun asked Nano to transfer the language to him.\n[Transfer of Thai has been completed.]\nBrrr!\nWith a trembling feeling in his mind, Chun Yeowun managed to understand it. And use it too.\n“Kill… funny.”\nWhen Chun Yeowun was able to fluently speak in Thai, Amuchai was shocked.\n“You speak my tongue.”\n“If you knew anything, then you would have heeded to the warning of the East Asia Union.”\n“Warning? Hahaha.”\nAt those words, Amuchai laughed.\n“Who is warning whom? Today you will cross the river of Hell!”\nAmuchai made a gesture of slitting the throat with thumb.\n“You may think you are the most famous one here, but the world is wide, man. And you are a frog in a well who knows nothing of the sea.”\nPang!\nAmuchai took his pose. The posture with which he raised his knees was similar to Muay Thai, but not entirely identical.\n“I’ll show you the power of Kantar.”\nCommon Muay Thai was strong, but not as strong compared to this new derivative. While Muay Thai crushes the bones and flesh, Kantar destroys mountains and seas.\n“Hah!”\nPhat!\nAmuchai raised his knee, and at that moment, a great amount of energy rose from the floor.\nPang!\nA rippling wind pressure engulfed the entire podium and swept upwards from the bottom. When the wind pressure hit the barrier, it felt like a storm inside.\n‘It has to be that.’\n‘He is indeed Amuchai!’\nThe strong people watched as if it was natural. They knew he was strong, but it was their first time seeing this technique. Even Ark Young was shocked.\n‘It’s like watching the void technique.’\nAmuchai’s kicks were similar to the Ark family technique that used the unification of energy, and Amuchai was a man who was absolutely strong enough to have kicks at that level.\nKohaku clicked his tongue and shook his head.\n‘I was hoping to see Amuchai exhausted, but is this already the end… !?’\nKohaku’s eyes, which thought the match was done, widened. His vision was blurred with the pressure inside, and saw an unbelievable sight.\n‘!!!’\nAs the wind subsided, everyone saw it.\n“Uhm!”\nPakpak!\nAmuchai, who was alive, seemed to be struggling, especially with Chun Yeowun holding his face tightly.\n“No way!”\n“What happened inside?”\nIt was their first time seeing Amuchai being held like this helplessly. The monster called the God of Killing couldn’t move.\n‘W-what is he?’\nAmuchai was confident enough to even win over an S-class entity alone. However, the moment the kick was released, Chun Yeowun moved like lightning and cut off his leg.\nDrip!\nThe floor on the podium was filled with blood. Chun Yeowun looked at the man in his hands and said.\n“I definitely warned you all.”\n“Eup!’\n“If you bother me one more time, I will kill you all.”\nCreepy!\nAmuchai tried to kick Chun Yeowun with his other leg, but felt a strange sensation upon impact.\nPak!\n‘!?’\nThe kick hit Chun Yeowun’s head, and a fan-shaped wind pressure then formed in the direction of the kick and the podium was devastated. It was a kick that could break the mountains.\n‘Yes!’\nHe tried to shake off the hand holding him.\nCrack!\n“Kuaaaak!”\nChun Yeowun’s fingers dug into his face. In the midst of the pain, Amuchai’s two eyes shook. Chun Yeowun’s head was intact despite the powerful kick, as if it hadn’t even hit him.\nCrack!\n‘T-this man survived this attack?’\nChun Yeowun spoke to Amuchai who was shocked.\n“That was nothing.”\nAfter undergoing five body reconstructions, Chun Yeowun’s body had surpassed the realm of human beings.\n‘\nM-Monster!’\nFor the first time, Amuchai felt fear.\n“For ignoring the warning, you need to be punished. You foolish Thai.”\n“Eup!”\nAmuchai was desperately trying to speak. If only he listened to the warning, things would have been fine, but–\n“You are too late.”\nCrack!\n“Kuaaak!”\nChun Yeowun tore off Amuchai’s face, and most people who witnessed it turned their heads away.\nBrrrr!\nAmuchai’s body, once the face was torn off, went limp. Chun Yeowun threw the body on the floor.\nThe dome that was moments before filled with noise had turned silent. Chae Mun-tak, known as\nI\n, and Jay, were shocked.\n“Amuchai…. Was killed that easily?”\nOne of the world's strongest men had died in vain. Everyone watching had expected a fierce battle, so the entire fight was nothing like they had expected.\n“This is too bothersome. Come at once.”",

      "content": "Chapter 156: Auction House Onboard (3)\n“This is too bothersome. Come at once.”\nThey were arrogant words. Many of the people gathered were world-famous warriors.\nTelling them to come out was attacking their pride, but:\n-Oh ho! No one is coming out. Look at that.\nAs the host said, the dome was silent, as if succumbing to Chun Yeowun’s seemingly crazy attitude. The game of the entertainment game had been decided so the host nodded his head, looked at the observation room that was instructing him, and spoke again.\n-Are the companions of Mr. Amuchai fine with the outcome?\nThere were two Thais and a few other Asians seated in the third row, and they were all members of the East Asia Union and masters of Kantar martial arts. The host was trying to instigate the anger of those who came along with Amuchai.\nBut it didn’t end there.\n“Are the rest of the VIPs also yielding to vice-chairman Chun Mu-seong?”\nAt those words, the faces of the powerful men who couldn’t respond to Chun Yeowun’s words became distorted. Everyone saw what had happened. Amuchair, the strongest among them, had died in vain so it was obvious that they would be hesitant to come out.\n‘Is that host… deliberately doing this?’\nEven though he was the host, his behavior seemed a little strange. Yet, the provocations worked.\nCrack!\nSomeone got up and kicked the ground. He was a young Thai about 190 cm tall and in his mid 30s.\n“Stop it. Didn’t you see our master suffer?”\n“I need to take revenge for him!”\n“Ugh!”\nThe Kantar martial arts masters tried to stop Amuchai’s disciple but gave up knowing that he wouldn’t listen.\nPat!\n“Konchosu!”\nKonchosu moved towards the podium and tried to hit the back of Chun Yeowun’s exposed back.\n‘Master’s enemy!’\nAlthough he wanted to take revenge, he knew that this man was stronger than him, meaning he would have to strike him from the back.\n‘Sea Splitting Technique!’\nIt was a technique that gathered energy at the feet and pushed it out, having enough power to split the sea.\n“Die!”\nShh!\nWith Chun Yeowun’s back exposed, Konchosu’s form zoomed onto his target. However,\n“Good. Perhaps I should get rid of the entire East Asia Union.”\n‘!?’\nChun Yeowun leisurely turned around and moved to the side, using his hand to strike Konchosu’s chest.\nPhat!\n“Kuak!”\nIn response to the energy penetrating Konchosu’s body, he bounced back.\n“Ack!”\n“What?”\nThree of the Thai warriors had to catch him before he hit something, and in doing so were pushed back very far.\n“M-Move!”\nOthers moved, seeing that his companions were unable to stop his movement.\nBang! Bang! Bang!\nThe seats made of marble were crushed and all three of the people who had tried to help the man were coughing up blood.\n‘How can he unleash so much energy in such a brief moment? He must also be a Master.’\nIf it were a simple attack, they wouldn’t have suffered so much; the agents of the East Asia Union couldn’t hide their anger any longer and decided to fight one by one.\n‘They lost a lot of power.’\nThe most important role in their current mission was played by Amuchai and the others who survived. However, losing them would mean failure of their mission. Seeing these people move of their own volition, Chun Yeowun considered them dumb.\n‘Chun Mu-seong, you bastard!’\nHowever, there was no one strong enough to face Chun Yeowun.\nWatching the events unfold, the man in the mask gulped and said.\n“I think we need to stop the game now. It’s becoming weird rather than exciting.”\n-No, encourage them more! Didn’t he just say that he would deal with all of them at once?\nJay spoke these words, at which the masked man couldn’t hide his confusion. As a host, he had to make sure the auction progressed naturally, and causing such a fight would create a bad light for the MS Group.\n“There could be opposition from VIPs…”\n-It doesn’t matter. Follow the orders!\nThe host turned off the earphone and took a deep breath. The man speaking was one of the ten executives of MS Group, so he couldn’t speak back.\n-Vice-chairman Chun Mu-seong made a great suggestion of having a one-against-all. How about it? We won’t have such a chance again.\nWhisper!\nAt the host's words, the audience became utter chaos.\nEveryone knew Chun Yeowun’s strength which made the VIPs puzzled at this battle being continued.\n‘What will happen if I step out?’\nSome people, like Jack Oren and Kohaku, had made up their minds to not participate. Not only did they judge that dealing with Chun Yeowun would be difficult, but the fact they had to team up with others and the ensuing shame were strikes to their prides.\nHowever, not everyone made such a wise choice.\nUnlike those who practiced martial arts, the people of foreign nations were confident that their techniques couldn’t be used by this man so a group of them appeared.\n“We will participate.”\nThey were the warriors from Australia. All eight people standing next to each other had abilities equivalent to those of A-class keepers and the brown man between them was an S-class keeper.\nThey decided to take the chance.\n‘What an idiot, trying to make an offer that puts himself at a disadvantage.’\nThey all laughed at Chun Yeowun. No matter how strong he was, if several talented people worked together, his defeat was inevitable. Out of confidence, they shouted at Chun Yeowun,\n“You suggested this. No regrets if you end up dying.”\nTak!\nThe person who appeared to be the leader of this group snapped his finger to send a gesture to the host to start the game. At the signal, the people cheered again.\n“Show us your martial arts!”\n“Phew!”\n-What an interesting group of challengers. These guests are guild members of the Black Roaring Guild, who came all the way from Australia with their guild leader Max.\nAs the purple-masked host raised his hand, the barrier went up once more.\nWoong!\nMax and the others waited for the barrier to form completely. They had been in the guild for a long time, so they had the time record of dealing with an S-class entity within 2 hours using their team work.\n-Pick!\nOnce the barrier formed completely, Max raised his hand, and two of the in line with fighting abilities tried to use them on Chun Yeowun. It was then:\nKwajik!\n‘!?’\nNo one understood what happened. Obviously, the people tried to close the gap the moment the barrier formed, but they seemed to have completely disappeared. The only trace of them left was the blood and flesh pieces on the ground they were just on.\n‘H-huh?’\nChun Yeowun had his palm pressed down. Those who learned martial arts were shocked by what he had done.\n‘He did that with his internal energy?’\nIt was an overwhelming energy that made others feel like they were being hit with a hammer.\nThe Australians who were trying to attack Chun Yeowun were instantly flattened to death. Chun Yeowun hadn’t thought of sparing anyone since this was a battle to the death.\n“Mo… Monster….”\n“He’s a monster.”\nEveryone in the audience felt like their life was being sucked out as they stared at the hand that tore off Amuchai’s face and had the power to literally crush people to death.\nThis was no longer entertainment but a massacre caused by one man.\n“Insane!”\nEven the host was mesmerized. It was too shocking. Chun then Yeowun sliced the barrier with his sword.\nSlash!\nWith two slashes, the barrier cracked, and an opening like a door’s entrance was created.\n“T-the barrier broke?”\nThe host couldn’t hide his shock. The barrier which an A-class entity couldn’t destroy had been taken down. Chun Yeowun left the barrier and grabbed the Ryun/Wheel, which was hanging next to the host.\n“Any more complaints?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, the host nodded his head. Everyone just watched the scene without saying a word. No one objected to it.\n-A-alright, let’s take a short break of 15 minutes.\nThe host decided that continuing the auction would be difficult with the current atmosphere. Meanwhile, in the observation room:\nJay’s face, which was staring through the window, was visibly pale.\n“… Is he a monster?”\nI\n, who was next to him, nodded. He too was equally shocked at this situation that went against their expectations.\n“What are we going to do now?”\nThe entertainment game failed, and in the event of this occurring, the MS Groupwas ready to gather the stronger fighters to achieve their goals.\n‘Before that…’\nChae Mun-tak looked at Jay, thinking of changing his orders.\nHe planned on dealing with Chun Yeowun and then using Jay as a scapegoat. Chae Mun-tak’s Odd Eye drifted.\n‘That has to be dealt with first.’\nJay was startled and turned his head to the side. He, too, wasn’t an ordinary person. There was no way he couldn’t sense that subtle energy radiating from Chae Mun-tak.\nTatak!\nMoving back, Jay asked.\n“What are you trying to do?”\nChae Mun-tak wiggled his fingers and said.\n“Since the leader already knows, shouldn’t someone just take the fall?”\n“And you want that someone to be me?”\nChae Mun-tak’s fingers were dyed with a glowing red energy. Jay, who knew his abilities, stepped towards the ground.\n“Where!”\nChae Mun-tak tried to catch Jay.\n-Grrr!\n“Euk!”\nHowever, in an instant, the floor was pierced and Chae Mun-tak fell into the lower floor.\nJay had the ability to corrode everything he touched. Looking at the aftermath, he mumbled,\n“I was almost done. I always knew that you would stab me in the back one day.”\nJay realized that he had to leave the scene right away. As he ran towards the entrance of the observation room, however, he heard a bang on the outside that kept getting closer.\n'Is he coming up already?’\nBang!\n“Kuak!”\nThe door next to the room shattered and someone’s head peeked out.\n“Kuak!”\n‘T-this person is?’\nThere was a man near the door who was bleeding – it was Chae Mun-tak’s escort, who was guarding the entrance of the room. Surprised, Jay took a step back and opened the door only to be greeted by someone unexpected.\nHe then realized who it was.\n“Chun, Chun Mu-seong, vice-chairman?”\nChun Yeowun had appeared in the observation room. After the match, Jay thought Chun Yeowun had returned to his seat, but he was actually making his way to the observation room.\nChun Yeowun stretched out his hand to Jay, who was trying to run away.\nWoong!\n“Euk!”\nHis body was lifted up and dragged towards Chun Yeowun, who caught him by the neck.\n“Kuak!”\n“Baldy. Are you the one in charge of this place?”\n‘!?’\nJay couldn’t hide his shock at these words. The guy in charge of this auction was happened to be on the floor below the room they were in.",

      "content": "Chapter 157: Auction House Onboard (4)\nJay, the bald man who was caught by the neck, couldn’t hide his shock. Of course, Chae Mun-tak had given him orders to kill Chun Yeowun, so he tried to instigate the fight through the auction host, but he didn’t try to do anything else.\n“Cough! L-let go of…”\n“If you are left in charge of this auction, what position do you have in MS Group?”\nPosition?\nHe was one of the ten high-ranking officials, or executives. At Chun Yeowun’s words, Jay saw that this man was targeting the high-ranking people in MS Group.\n‘Isn’t it dangerous for me to reveal my identity, then?’\nThis was a bad situation, in the group the person he was supposed to work along with had abandoned him and was ready to kill him, and now if he let this monster know of his position, he would die.\n‘I need to run away.’\nJay, who was determined to run, revealed his ability, which corroded anything it came in contact with. Since Chun Yeowun was holding his neck, he could use his ability perfectly.\nWoong!\n‘Wh…at?’\nChun Yeowun’s hand, which should have been corroded, was intact. Of course, they weren’t entirely fine, but Chun Yeowun already normally protected his body with energy and sensed that Jay was trying to do something to him.\n“You. You’re up to something useless.”\n“Kuak, w-wait…”\nChun Yeowun slammed the man to the floor.\nBang!\nThe floor cracked.\n“Ackkk!”\nJay’s face had turned red and swollen, as if his veins were about to burst. Although he was talented, he never trained his body for such powerful attacks. In a way, it felt like he was going to die.\n“So weak.”\nChun Yeowun was beyond puzzled at the sight of this high ranking executive who was way too weak. Once he thought about it, he realized that the people in charge of the secret MS hideouts weren’t very strong either.\n“Well then, shouldn’t you start opening your mouth?”\nChun Yeowun was planning on using the Ghost ability to read Jay’s mind, but he surrendered.\n“Kuaaak! I-I surrender! I’ll tell you everything you want so let me live!”\n“… What?”\nA quick surrender. Jay had a great sense of survival.\nMeanwhile, Chae Mun-tak, who had fallen to the floor due to Jay’s corrosion ability, came to his senses. As he also had a fighting ability that he could use, but he didn’t train his body, causing him to get a concussion when he fell.\n“Kuak, that Jo Hogi!”\nJay’s real name was Jo Hogi, and Chae Mun-tak hadn’t expected the baldy to use his ability in such a way.\n‘How long was I out for?’\nAlthough it was only for a brief moment, the pain in his head made him check the time to figure out how much time he had lost. He took out his phone and turned on the CCTV video watching the room to which Jay had fled.\n‘This!’\nHe could see Jay being nailed down and Chun Yeowun in front of him. Chae Mun-tak realized it wouldn’t be possible to return to that room now.\n‘Chun Mu-seong moved first?’\nThis was unexpected. He double-tapped on the earphone on his left ear.\n“Cheol-ryeong! Can you hear me?”\nHe spoke it almost like a whisper. After a short moment, someone answered.\n-Yes, Senior Researcher.\n“Code Red.”\n-Code Red!\nCode Red signaled that the worst outcome was happening.\n-Are you stopping the auction now?\nAt Cheol-ryeong’s question, Chae Mun-tak faced trouble. The best, safest answer was to stop the auction and escape with all the items, but if they did that, they would lose the interest and support from the VIP customers.\n‘If that happens, the head or even the entire table will hold me accountable.’\nHe would be killed even if he tried to run away. Once the MS Group put its mind to it, it could find anyone.\n‘What do I do?’\nSomething flashed through his mind. There was a chance he could take advantage of the situation naturally.\n“I have to move.”\nIt would, at least, help avoid losing the VIPs.\n“Cheol-ryeong. Bring the escorts out right now and put the 4th Gen and 5th Gen prototypes on the podium.”\n-Huh? They’re supposed to be shown at the end of the auction…\n“Now isn’t the time for questions.”\nChae Mun-tak decided to adopt an all-or-nothing approach for the current predicament. Since Chun Mu-seong was running rampant, the only solution was to stop the auction.\n-Alright.\nChae Mun-tak gave the orders and took a silver mask out of his sleeve. Wearing that mask, he hurried down to the first floor of the dome.\nIn the dome’s observation room, Jo Hogi, with a shaking body that was trembling due to his broken spine, explained the situation to Chun Yeowun.\n“I-I was abandoned by the group. Please believe me.”\nJo Hogi figured that, even if he were to escape with his life, he would die in the hands of the MS Group, so clinging to Chun Yeowun was his only hope.\n“Hmm.”\nChun Yeowun looked at him. His eyes shone with a will to live, as he didn’t seem to be lying.\n“Please! Please save me!”\nFrom what Chun Yeowun was told, Jo Hogi moved against MS Group's order and was cut off. However, Jo Hogi said that the person in charge of the auction house was another one of his colleagues who was trying to pin all of the trouble on him.\n‘He’s worth using.’\nIf he could use this man, he would be able to enter the MS Group from the inside.\n“There are two more executives besides you?”\n“Y-yes.”\n“Where are these two?”\n“\nE\nis bound to arrive soon, and the man in charge is\nI\n, or Chae Mun-tak, who fell down.”\nJo Hogi pointed to the hole in the floor. Chun Yeowun approached the floor and looked down.\n“There’s no one there.”\n“Ugh, he’ll probably come up to kill me.”\nChae Mun-tak had manipulated the auction and tried to use Jo Hogi as a scapegoat, so Jo Hogi thought Chae Mun-tak would for sure try to come up to kill him.\n“Are you sure?”\n“Yes.”\nChun Yeowun couldn’t feel any energy moving towards this room. That was when Jo Hogi looked out of the window.\n“No! Chae Mun-tak, that bastard!”\n“What?”\n“Chae Mun-tak is over there…”\nThe place where Jo Hogi pointed out the window was the dome. There was a man standing on the podium wearing a silver mask: Chae Mun-tak. All of the guests were all looking at him.\n-Nice to meet you. My name is\nI\n, and I am in charge of this auction house. It seems like it’s the first time our guests have faced such a situation.\nThe appearance of a high-ranking MS Group executive who oversaw the auction house in secrecy behind the scenes was enough to attract their attention.\n“What is he doing?”\nJo Hogi couldn’t answer Chun Yeowun’s question. A high-ranking executive wouldn’t appear in public unless it was really special, so Chae Mun-tak had to be up to something.\n“I-I don’t know.”\n“… You really don’t.”\nChun Yeowun looked at him with annoyed eyes. Even if he was an executive in charge of an auction house, this man knew nothing.\n‘But what is that bastard doing out there?’\nThere was no way that Chae Mun-tak was unaware that someone broke into the room, as it alone had 6 CCTV cameras inside..\n‘Did that Chae Mun-tak bastard see…’\nJo Hogi frowned as he figured out Chae Mun-tak’s intentions. There were influential people from all over the world at the auction, and it seemed that Chae Mun-tak appeared suddenly to prevent Chun Yeowun from harming him by taking the cover of the VIPs.\n‘That bastard. He’s outsmarted me!’\nJo Hogi grinded his teeth. In order to survive he ended up begging this man, but that one was playing tricks!\nWhing!\nAt that moment, the center of the platform opened and something rose up surrounded by glass protectors.\nThe spectacle was labeled ‘Fourth Generation’, and a total of 24 men and women of various nationalities and ages were on the platform in restraints.\n“Ohh!”\n“4th Gen!”\nThe VIPs all seemed excited at the sight, as they were attending this place mainly for the auction of these humans. The humans in the glass protectors were the 4th Gen combat weapons created through various genetic modifications.\n“Did they make those?”\nChun Yeowun clicked his tongue when looking at those humans. He had seen the genetically engineered “humans” in the VIP room of Black Athena, and never thought he’d see them again after that.\nChae Mun-tak opened his mouth again.\n-This isn’t the end! What you have been waiting for…. We are here to show that to you today!\nSnap!\nWhen Chae Mun-tak snapped his fingers, the floor cracked and something came up with smoke. As if revealing a new product, the new arrival was unveiled with glass protectors that had rose gold designs, giving it an ornate appearance.\nUnlike the previous ones, this human had its face covered, and in the center, ‘Fifth Generation’ was written in red letters.\n“Woahhhhh!”\nClap! Clap!\nPeople stood up and began to clap at the 5th Gen modified human. The officials of each nation's National Defense wanted these, and in fact only participated in MS Group’s auctions because of their reputation to produce the most effective combat weapons.\nChae Mun-tak pressed a button on a wireless terminal.\nClick!\nThe glass protector around the 4th Gen humans was released and the humans who previously had their eyes closed, opened their eyes and walked forward.\n-I think the 4th Gen is familiar to those who attended the last auction.\nThe 4th Gen all wore unique silver mechanical suits, with energy sources shining like LED lights in the center of their suits.\n‘No!’\nChun Yeowun’s eyes lit up. The radiating light in the suits’ centers wasn’t just any energy.\nIt was the energy of cores.\nBased on the levels of energy of each human, the 4th Gen were equipped with B-class cores. The exact use of the cores was unknown, but it seemed like the energy source for the suit. Chae Mun-tak exclaimed in a loud voice,\n-Behold, the latest work of our group today!\nClank!\nWhen Chae Mun-tak pressed the button again, the entrance of the 5th Gen’s gorgeous glass protector opened. A light was pointing at the podium, and as the entrance opened, a man with a golden suit, gray hair, no expression, and a long scar in the corner of his right eye, walked out.\nStep!\nIntense energy was emanating from his suit. Chun Yeowun couldn’t feel the energy when the 5th Gen was caged, but once he was out, the energy was impossible to miss.\n“No way…”\n“Is that an S-class core?”\nThe light from the core was unmistakably an S-class core. Most of the VIP guests who attended guessed that the 5th Gen weapon used an A-class core, but this exceeded their expectations.\nKohaku of Speed was surprised as well.\n‘A 4th Gen itself is tough to fight without Sukeru; this must be a monster.’\nThe pure energy alone surpassed the warriors who were the strongest in their nations, making them wonder if A-class and S-class cores could be used as the strongest weapons without refining them.\n‘Have they established a technology to withstand an S-class core?’\nIf this knowledge was released to the world, chaos would definitely ensue. The next-gen human weapons of MS Group were still prototypes, but if they could be commercialized, all the countries would make huge investments.\n‘I want to see it!’\n‘How much will it be?’\nEveryone in the dome wanted to know how powerful the 5th Gen was, as the reason that it was revealed here was to demonstrate its power. A middle-aged blonde, presumably American, woman spoke,\n“Please show us the demo!”\n“C'est vrai! Nous voulons aussi voir!”\n[Right! We want to see it too!]\nPeople of national defense kept speaking. They wanted to see the 5th Gen weapon in action.\n-No need to rush! Even if you didn’t ask, we were going to demonstrate it any ー\nIt was then.\nClank!\nIt was the sound of glass breaking, and someone entered and stood in the middle of the podium.\n“Vi-vice chairman of Yongchun?”\n“Chun Mu-seong?”\nIt was Chun Yeowun who had suddenly gone onto the podium. At his appearance, all the VIP guests expressed their shared displeasure.\n“What the hell are you doing?”\nA woman from the US National Guard shouted at Chun Yeowun. Even though this man was strong, she couldn’t hold back her anger, but Chun Yeowun ignored her and moved to the 5th Gen human, saying,\n“Baekgi!”\nThe human weapon which the MS Group revealed as the 5th Gen was none other than Baekgi, Chun Yeowun’s subordinate whom Chun Yeowun had attended the auction to find!\n“Baekgi. It’s me. Get yourself together!”\nDespite Chun Yeowun’s words, Baekgi stared back with an expressionless face. Chae Mun-tak was smiling behind the mask.\n‘As expected!’\nChae Mun-tak was skeptical at first. The place Baekgi came from had a bottle containing the blood of the Flame Qilin, and Chae Mun-tak received a report that Chun Yeowun had brought a man with red hair with a similar background. MS Group had assumed that the human they found frozen had something to do with the Demonic Cult, and they were right!\n‘Originally I was intending to use it as a negotiation card.’\nHowever, he now had to change his plans. Chae Mun-tak spoke.\n-This is good. Guest Chun Mu-seong has volunteered to help us with the demo.\nChun Yeowun looked at the man.\n“What are you planning?”\nIgnoring Chun Yeowun’s question, he spoke to the audience.\n-It is an honor to present to you: the 5th Gen!\nChae Mun-tak ordered while looking at Baekgi.\n-Neutralize the opponent in front of you.\nAs soon as the words came out, the energy source in the middle of the golden suit emitted an ever stronger light and Baekgi rushed towards Chun Yeowun.\n-This is a combat weapon we’ve concentrated all of our resources on. Can he deal with it?’\nIt was a perfect weapon for winning a battle, and there was no way this man would recognize Chun Yeowun.\nAt that, Chun Yeowun simply gave an order to Baekgi who was coming at him.\n“The Chun Ma of the Great Sky Demon Order orders you, Baekgi, on your knees.”\nChae Mun-tak smiled bitterly.\n‘There is no way that such an order will work…’\nAt that moment, something unbelievable happened.\nThud!\nBaekgi, who was running towards Chun Yeowun, suddenly fell to his knees. Even Chae Mun-tak couldn’t hide his shock.\n‘W-what the hell just happened?’",

      "content": "Chapter 158: Baekgi (1)\nThe Thunder Wind Kick, Baekgi.\nHe was one of the Six Swords of the Demon God, Chun Yeowun. As a leader of the clan, he was also at the center of the revival period of the Sky Demon Order, and was a master in thunder qi usage.\nAfter drinking the blood of the Dragon Turtle, one of the Five Spirit Beasts, he gained the thunder qi, giving him the name Thunder Demon.\n[Grind and polish it within you. It will help you control the thunder qi inside.]\nChun Yeowun’s closest aides had drunk the blood of Imoogi and were possessors of the demonic energy for a long time.\nBaekgi, specifically, never neglected to learn to control the demonic energy under Chun Yeowun’s guidance.\nWooong!\nEven if he couldn’t think, that demonic power inside of him succumbed and he couldn’t fight against the control of Sky Demon Energy.\nTremble!\nBaekgi, kneeling on the floor, couldn’t move. His mind was clear with no thoughts, but the demonic energy within was controlling his body.\n‘\nH-How?’\nChae Mun-tak couldn’t understand it. His eyes in the holes of the mask, trembled. To him, Chun Yeowun said.\n“Did you think that a loyal member of the Great Sky Demon Order would listen to your orders?”\nWhisper!\nThe reaction of the VIP customers began to change. The 5th Gen was a new improvement that they had huge expectations for, but they didn’t know what kind of ‘product’ it was.\nChae Mun-tak bit his lips.\n‘Seriously, he isn’t an easy one to deal with.’\nOf course, it seemed to be difficult. The other VIPS were aiming to try to create a deep bond with Chun Yeowun, who had the strength to take down multiple organizations.\n“Huh!”\nChun Yeowun approached Baekgi, who was kneeling. He knew that tampering with Baekgi’s mind and forcing it to undergo regeneration would restore his memory, like what had happened with Hu Bong.\n“Wait!”\nChae Mun-tak turned off the mic and said.\n“I didn’t foresee this situation… but I did anticipate a situation where a person’s memory would be revived.”\n“What?”\nClack!\nChae Mun-tak pressed a button on the terminal, and both of Baekgi’s eyes widened as he began to speak in a mechanical manner.\n“Chipset mode activated.”\nClank!\nThe sound of something changing within Baekgi’s body. Although it couldn’t be seen on the outside, the control devices penetrated into the spine of the suit he was wearing while not inflicting any pain onto him.\nCrack!\n‘!?’\nIgnoring the demonic energy, Baekgi stood up because of the device inserted into each spine; starting with the chip implanted in the brain, they were able to control the whole body.\n“Ohoh!”\n“It’s moving again.”\nThe people seemed interested in the 5th Gen once more. Chae Mun-tak turned on the mic again and said.\n-Everyone, in case we lose control of the 5th Gen human, MS Group has made sure to take proper precautionary measures through the release of the NC-35X chip that will relieve your anxiety.\nChae Mun-tak looked at Chun Yeowun with a smile.\n‘Are you flustered? Fufufu. I’m Chae Mun-tak.’\nChae Mun-tak.\nIn the past, he had earned the name of a genius geneticist, receiving the attention of many celebrities and press.\nAmong MS Group’s researchers, he boasted the highest proficiency in genetics and neural control.\n‘Well, this is nothing for me.’\nTo him, this innovation was nothing to brag about. He said to Chun Yeowun,\n“Outdated warriors like you martial artists tend to downplay the power of science and technology. I’ll show you his power!”\n‘\nKill him.\n’\nAt the end, “kill him” was whispered. Despite the noisy dome, would Baekgi be able to hear it?\n“Yes.”\nWith those words, an electric shock blasted through his body.\nPachk!\nSparks dazzled around his body as if he were a god of thunder. The spectators continued to watch him intently.\nThe sparks emitted looked a little huge, but the suit he wore made sure that he wasn’t channeling too much.\n‘Indeed, MS Group’s tech prowess is decades ahead of ours.’\n‘I need to maintain my ties with them.’\nRepresentatives came here not only for the auction but also to form connections with MS Group.\nPachik!\nBaekgi, engulfed in the electricity, finally moved.\nCompletely dominated by the machine inside him, his movements were rapid.\nPhat!\nHe moved so fast that he left behind a streak of light. Even Kohaku, who prided himself for being the fastest, was startled at Baekgi’s speed.\nPachik!\nIn the eyes of those who didn’t practice martial arts, Baekgi seemed to have teleported behind Chun Yeowun as he unleashed a thunderous kick that flew at Chun Yeowun’s head.\nSwish!\nChun Yeowun’s form blurred in an instant, changing direction to raise his left arm to block the kick.\nPachik!\nAt that moment, the light of the S-class core in the center of Baekgi’s suit grew stronger, causing the power in the kick to grow.\nTatatak!\nChun Yeowun was pushed back, as even though he was directly blocking it, the kick was still extremely powerful.\n‘You idiot.’\nChae Mun-tak laughed at Chun Yeowun. Hundreds of clinical trials were done to analyze and optimize the full power of Baekgi, who had both the thunder qi and the S-class core.\nIt was no exaggeration to say that it was MS Group’s greatest work, or even its masterpiece.\nPapapak!\nIn an instant, Baekgi unleashed tremendous power.\nAs soon as he unfolded the technique of his clan, causing not just the podium but also the ship to shake. Even though the barrier was just reinstated, the dome started cracking as it became unable to withstand the power from Baekgi.\n‘What unbelievable power!’\nThe people around the dome were shocked.\n-Chik!\n“Damn!”\n“Isn't the dome going to break?”\nEven though the ceiling was open, they were worried as they were in the middle of a sea.\nThe power Baekgi had was different from what Baek Jong-so, the current leader of the Pure Kick Clan, possessed, and the techniques he used were confusing with attacks flying in from different angles.\nFor anyone else, it could be intimidating, but Chun Yeowun smiled.\n“Even with that body, you have grown so much.”\nThe difference of Baekgi now and him of the past was like the difference between heaven and earth. Chun Yeowun remembered when he used to train with the Six Swords.\n“Of course, the results were always the same.”\nPapapak!\nChun Yeowun blocked the attacks with just one hand. Baekgi was doing his best, but Chun Yeowun didn’t move a single step and kept blocking them.\n‘Did he get stronger than before?’\n‘Can he stop that?’\nKohaku and Jack were shocked. Even they themselves would have a sense of desperation if they were to respond to Baekgi’s attacks, but Chun Yeowun was doing so in such a leisurely manner.\n‘What the hell… was he hiding his powers?’\nThe gap in skill and ability was unmistakable..\nEven if the S-class core was being fully utilized, the difference was still too great.\nPak!\nChun Yeowun, who was blocking a kick, grabbed Baekgi’s ankle and slammed him down like a hammer ramming the floor.\nKwaang!\nThe moment Baekgi’s body struck the floor, the podium collapsed and the dome split in all directions, causing people to jump up in panic.\n“Kuak!”\nAs the podium collapsed, the place where Chae Mun-tak stood too had collapsed. Fortunately, this time he didn’t faint from the fall.\n‘W-what happened?’\nChae Mun-tak looked at the podium in shock. He thought that the 5th Gen he made by pouring in his heart and soul would be the best one, but it still seemed to be suffering.\n‘Ah!’\nHowever, it turned out to be fine. Baekgi’s body, which was on the floor, didn’t show any injuries on it; not even a hair was out of order. At that moment, Chun Yeowun placed his hand on Baekgi’s chest and head.\n‘What is he up to?’\nChae Mun-tak didn’t know what was happening until a beeping sound came from the terminal.\nBeep! Beep! Beep!\nChae Mun-tak‘s eyes widened at what he saw.\n[Error! Error! Error!]\nHe couldn’t hide his fluster at the error displayed on the terminal that was controlling Baekgi.\n‘What is this?’\nChae Mun-tak hurriedly accessed the terminal, trying to fix the error by entering a code. However, his expression went stiff.\n‘What? W-what just happened?’\nChhhh!\nHis terminal was changing things up and the program was being modified.\nIt was,\n‘Hacking?’\nThe phenomenon of something changing in the program and chips which controlled Baekgi had to be due to hacking.\n‘No. I-I need to disable the system!’\nTatatak!\nChae Mun-tak continued to try and stop it, but nothing worked. Confused, he raised his head and looked at Chun Yeowun.\nAll the man did was put his palm on his chest. What just happened?\n[The command code of the main chip has been completely bypassed.]\nNano’s voice echoed in Chun Yeowun’s head. What was hacking was none other than Nano. No matter how great the technology of MS Group was, it was nothing compared to the tech inside Chun Yeowun which was from the far future.\n‘No! This has to be stopped!’\nTatak!\nChae Mun-tak tried to switch the terminal to control the 24 4th Gen human weapons, who came down the podium standing with their eyes glowing.\n“Kill him right now!”\nAt the moment the order fell, they all flew at once. The movements of the 4th Gen human weapons using the B-class core were comparable to those of Superior Masters.\nPapapah!\nIt was then.\nFlash!\nLightning flashed in the air, striking all 24 of the human weapons at the same time.\nKwakwakwang!\nAs a result, all 24 of them crashed to the ground simultaneously.\n“D-damn it!”\nChae Mun-tak cursed at it. This was an unforeseen situation. Unlike the 5th Gen, the other 4th Gen suits were only made to withstand the energy from the core.\n“Wh… what was… how did this happen…”\nChae Mun-tak looked at Baekgi, who was standing in the middle with his hand stretched out.\nThat was the proof that it was he who had called for the lightning. Ultimately, due to the overload of the lightning, the 24 human weapons closed their eyes and fainted.\nDrip!\nTears filled with blood were running down Baekgi’s eyes; the blood was coming out because of the chip in his head being destroyed. His condition didn’t look good, but his face was also different from before.\nHis face, which before had been emotionless, was now frowning.\n‘No!’\nChae Mun-tak couldn’t hide his anxiety. And that soon turned into reality as Baekgi spoke.\n“Who! Who dares to touch the Chun Ma of the Great Sky Demon Order!”\nA loud shout like a lion. The cracks in the dome grew and people covered their ears. Seeing that, Chun Yeowun smiled.\n“You are back, Baekgi.”\nBaekgi’s lips twisted at those words. As if he were convulsing, his eyes turned red.\n‘Ahhh!’\nIt was a voice he had wanted to hear so desperately. Although Baekgi had a blunt personality, he was very emotional.\nPak!\nHe knelt as he continued to cry.\n“One of the Six Swords of the Demon God, Baekgi, greets my Lord!”",

      "content": "Chapter 159: Baekgi (2)\nA thousand years ago.\nEveryone was watching the former clan leader, who had once dominated through power, lie on his deathbed. Everyone around him had tears in their eyes at the sight of this once powerful man on the bed, vulnerable and gasping for air.\nBaek Yong, the current leader, looked at his father.\n“Father, do you have anything left to say?”\n“Haa… Haa… look after the cult.”\n“H… how can we not? I will make sure that our Pure Kick Clan will continue to flourish under me.”\nHe resembled his father to a great degree, but the bluntness in his eyes soon turned red. Who wouldn’t be sad when watching their father die?\nBaekgi’s breathing gradually weakened, as he said to Baek Yong,\n“Something… needs… to be… checked.”\n“Huh?”\nBaek Yong couldn’t understand it.\n“Father. What are you saying—”\nBefore he could find out, Baekgi’s head fell to the side.\n“Father!”\n“Former Leader!”\nEveryone in the family was shocked. The legendary leader of the Pure Kick Clan had passed away.\nAnd after his death, his funeral lasted 49 days, but on the 43rd day of the funeral:\nSilence fell around. After waiting some time, someone approached the coffin behind the funeral, where the incense was lit. The man who approached the coffin pushed the lid aside.\nInside, the body of Baekgi lying lifelessly with a pale face.\nScc!\nThe intruder put something into his mouth, and something amazing happened. After the 43rd day of death, Baekgi woke up.\n“\nCough\n!\nCough\n!”\nWaking up with constant coughing, Baekgi tried to control his breathing. Calming down, he lifted him and looked at the man in the shadows.\n“You are late, Seong Mu-chun.”\nThe man who brought him back from death was no other than Seong Mu-chun, the seer of the Sky Demon Order. To that, Seong Mu-chun smiled.\n“Are you ready to die again?”\n“Disgusting words.”\n“Such words from one of the Six Swords. When you open your eyes, the world will be different. It will be entirely different from what it is now. if you plan on changing your mind, do it now.”\nDespite that, Baekgi said.\n“… If it means I can see my lord, it doesn’t matter.”\nAnd the moment he came to his senses, he saw a familiar face in front of him. The hair was short and the clothes were different, but the face was the same as ever.\n“Lord!”\n“Baekgi.”\nThe two just looked at each other, each conveying their emotions. Their eyes were adept enough to see the other’s body state.\n‘He is fine, that is all I need to know.’\nBaekgi felt relieved that Chun Yeowun wasn’t hurt.\n‘What is this?’\nHowever, his body felt very strange, as on his body were various iron equipment, and as if a new dantian had been created, he felt a newfound energy emanating from the center of his chest.\n“Don’t worry, measures were taken to prevent any harm to your body.”\nOf course, Nano had prevented any bodily injuries.\n“Ah!”\nAt those words, Baekgi felt relieved; he had confidence in Chun Yeowun’s skills since their time at the Academy.\nChun Yeowun would never lie to him.\n“This place is so confusing,”\nBaekgi looked around and said. This world was much different from what he imagined, from the clothes people wore to the shape of buildings.\n‘Damn it!’\nChae Mun-tak couldn’t understand what was unfolding. Not only did his greatest prototype fall into Chun Yeowun’s hands, but all 24 of the 4th Gen models were taken down.\n“I think it’ll be difficult to hold the auction for any longer.”\n“Let’s go back.”\n“If I stay here, my life will be in danger.”\nThe murmurs of people resonated throughout the ship, and Chae Mun-tak noticed people began leaving the dome.\nAs he was an idiot, he could recognize that the auction was ruined.\n“Let’s take advantage of this chaos.”\n“There might be goods under the deck.”\nIn addition to the people leaving, the East Asia Union was trying to break through the chaos to retake some of the auction items that were stolen by MS Group.\nCrack!\nChae Mun-tak gritted his teeth. Because of one person — just one person — everything had become a mess.\n‘Chun Mu-seong!’\nHe understood why such a man was classified as dangerous.\nShh!\nSuddenly, a man wearing a suit and mask appeared next to Chae Mun-tak.\n“Senior, many of our guests are heading to the speedboats.”\nThis auction was held in the middle of the sea, and there was one way out.\n“Cheol-ryeong, the items?”\n“As you said, we transferred them in advance.”\n“Good job.”\nChae Mun-tak sighed. Most of the auction items were moved in case of an emergency.\n“Are you sure you want to stop the auction completely?’\n“Yes.”\nHe knew that he couldn’t fight against Chun Yeowun and win. By now, Chun Yeowun too must have realized that MS Group was aiming for his life, and staying here would be dangerous.\n“What about them?”\nCheol-ryeong looked at Chun Yeowun and Baekgi, who were still on the broken dome.\n“They must be buried here.”\nCheol-ryeong asked again,\n“Should we use\nthat\n?”\n“Use it. No matter how strong he is, do you think he'll be able to deal with that monster in this sea at night?”\nHearing the confirmation, Chae Mun-tak hurried out of the dome, at which Chun Yeowun laughed.\n“Quite a silly one you are.”\nChun Yeowun reached out, and a deep shiver passed through Chae Mun-tak’s body as he tried to run away. It was then,\nPapapak!\n“Die!”\nThe escorts around the dome moved to Chun Yeowun at once. Each of them were Master level warriors, but there was no need for Chun Yeowun to even use his hands.\n“Hmph!”\nBaekgi raised his hand and pushed it down, causing the people moving toward them to fall down.\nPachik!\nKwakwang!\n“Kuak!”\n“Ack!”\nIt was impossible for those who were weaker than him to withstand the pressure, when even the human weapons couldn’t. Meanwhile, Chae Mun-tak, who tried to escape, was dragged back.\n“Senior researcher!”\nThe subordinate named Cheol-ryeong jumped and grabbed Chae Mun-tak’s body to stop it from being dragged.\n‘What kind of power is this?’\nNow, both of them were being dragged.\n“Kuak!”\nAfter a few moments, Cheol-ryeong let go of Chae Mun-tak; while it was definitely the right decision, the one left behind wouldn’t see it that way.\nPak!\n“Ugh!”\n“What a disloyal subordinate.”\nCheol-ryeong ran away from the dome without looking back, but Chun Yeowun didn’t mind as, after all, his purpose was to get his hands on an executive. Since he regained Baekgi as well, there were no more strong forces on the ship that could go against him.\n“Let’s see your face.”\nPak!\nChun Yeowun took off Chae Mun-tak’s mask, revealing the face of a man with different eye colors. The person looked much more ordinary than he expected, and his face was full of fear.\n“Eek!”\n“You wanted to make a deal with me, but your actions didn’t match what you were saying.”\nChun Yeowun, who was speaking, frowned, as he felt something strange.\n‘What is this?’\nHe already caught the man, but something felt off; the man looked fine, but didn’t seem to have any life.\n“…What are you?”\n“W-what are you doing!?”\nChun Yeowun narrowed his eyes, concentrating on the palm holding Chae Mun-tak’s neck.\nThe palm was definitely warm, but Chun Yeowun couldn’t feel any pulse coming from it.\nPak!\nChun Yeowun suddenly grabbed Chae Mun-tak’s right arm.\n“W-why my arm—”\nAnd then, without mercy, he tore it off.\nTear!\nIt should have been painful and scary, but Chae Mun-tak didn’t scream. On the contrary, it was Chun Yeowun whose expression changed.\n“Ha!”\nThe result was shocking. When the arm was ripped off, a bunch of wires were disconnected within the arm.\nSpark!\nIn addition, sparks were flying off. Chun Yeowun didn’t realize since the skin was made so elaborately, but he then figured that the body was a machine.\n“What are you?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s question, Chae Mun-tak erased his scared expression and spoke,\n“I didn’t expect you to notice this was an avatar so quickly, but it’s already too late.”\n“Avatar?”\nNano’s voice eased the confusion of Chun Yeowun.\n[An avatar isn’t an actual body, but a separate one that a user controls. It isn’t a technology that should be available at the current time period.]\nThere was flesh surrounding the machine. Thus technology was originally developed for people with physical disabilities, and it was supposed to take a few more decades before a human-type android would become popular. This was a prime example of MS Group’s technological prowess.\n“You're a rat. You think I can’t catch you?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, the avatar smiled.\n“Hahahaha, it’s already too late for that.”\n“What?”\n“You see, the ship has already departed.”\nNear the west side of the auction was a ship with all its lights shut off moving away. It was very different from the speedboat that the guests used.\nOn board, a man with a unique helmet could be seen. Using the goggles attached to the helmet, he looked at Chun Yeowun, who was clutching the avatar’s neck.\n‘It's a good thing I got the avatar from 'F' recently and developed it.’\nThe technology wasn’t commercialized yet, and only a select few executives were given them in case of an emergency, but Chae Mun-tak never thought that it would be so useful as he grinned.\n“Don’t tell me that you thought I would put myself in such an unreasonable situation?”\n-You seemed to have thought this through.\n“You’ll be buried in the sea soon.”\n-Buried?\n“Why do you think we held the auction in the middle of the sea?”\nThere were more than just one or two people who targeted the MS group, and governments were always trying to keep their eyes on them while others were trying to steal their technology.\nIn such situations, the auction could be selected and destroyed each time. As Chae Mun-tak stopped speaking, someone spoke to him.\n“Cheol-ryeong has arrived.”\nPik!\nA video feed appeared in the goggles, showing a black figure on a water scooter approaching the dark ship. Chae Mun-tak ordered,\n“Release the Kraken.”\n“The VIP guests haven’t left yet, are you sure it’ll be fine?”\nA subordinate asked in concern. To be honest, Chae Mun-tak was just trying to stall for time, but didn’t think that Chun Yeowun would find out so quickly that he had been dealing with an avatar the whole time.\nUrgently, Chae Mun-tak said,\n“Release it.”\nIf it was\nthat\nmonster, the sea would become chaotic very soon. Chae Mun-tak judged that he had enough time to get to a safe distance away from it.\n“Alright.”\nChae Mun-tak exhaled with a nervous face. This is the first time they unlocked the A-class Alpha hazard entity, ‘Kraken’.\nThe monster was given the name of the monster from the legends, which was known to be the largest predator of the sea due to its immense size.\n‘At least a target can be signaled.’\nIf they sent a signal to Kraken, it would attack the auction house. A detector suddenly appeared on the goggles.\nFrom the depth of the sea, a monster began to rise up quickly.\n“I hope you can engrave your fear into the night sea.”\nWith that, Chae Mum-tak tried to turn off the helmet, but,\n“Huh?”\nChun Yoeuwn, who was holding the avatar, suddenly turned elsewhere: to the western side of the auction house.\n‘Idiot, it’s already too late. Have a long, hard fight with the Kraken…’\nAt that moment, he saw Chun Yeowun step towards the sea as an amazing phenomenon happened.\nJjkkk!\nThe sea water began freezing at a rapid rate around Chun Yeowun at an unimaginable speed.\n“The sea is… freezing?”\nWook!\nThe entire ship shook violently.\n“Ugh!”\nUnable to keep the balance, Chae Mun-tak fell to the floor. Confused, he took off his helmet on his head and stood up.\n“R-researcher, look outside!”\nOne of the crewmates then shouted.\nAt that, Chae Mun-tak looked outside. Seeing what was happening, his eyes trembled.\n“W-what is this…”\nThe entire surface around the ship was frozen.\n“No!”\nAt least 300 meters away from the auction house was the sound signifying that the whole sea within the distance was frozen.",

      "content": "Chapter 160: Kraken (1)\n‘What’s he planning?’\nChun Yeowun was sure that Chae Mun-tak had something planned, then feeling the oscillations of the ship gradually increasing in strength.\nIt was swaying less compared to other ships because of its size, but he could still feel it.\n‘Is something coming from underneath the ship?’\nChun Yeowun judged quickly that if something was coming from the sea, he needed to create a defense first.\nJjkkk!\nHe decided to use Ice Qi, emitting a distinctly cold energy. Chun Yeowun, who held the purest form of energy in his body, covered the nearby sea area in just a few seconds.\n‘Got it.’\nEven though it was his first time, it seemed to be successful. The ship’s swaying stopped once an ice layer 2 meters thick was created. In addition, as the water froze, Chae Mun-tak’s fleeing ship also got caught in the ice.\n“Thought you could run away?”\nChun Yeowun said to the avatar in his hand, which didn’t move. It was then,\nThud! Thud! Thud!\nThe ship, which he thought had finally calmed, shook as if it were being pounded by something in the sea.\n“Lord!”\nBaekgi ran to where Chun Yeowun was, thinking that the ship was acting unusually and was shocked when the sea froze.\n“This… Lord, did you freeze all of this?”\nChun Yeowun nodded. At that, Baekgi wondered how much Chun Yeowun had grown.\n‘… he is still a monster to me.’\nSeong Mu-cheon said that his Lord had gone into the future due to an unexpected accident, and Baekgi figured that Chun Yeowun would grow steadily in the new environment. However, he was showing phenomenally exponential growth.\n‘Is he Chun Ma?’\n1\nBaekgi had amazing talent as well, but he couldn’t be compared to Chun Yeowun.\nShh!\nAt that moment, the golden-haired Gumiho in the appearance of a baby fox appeared from Chun Yeowun’s hands.\n“A fox?”\nBaekgi who looked at it seemed puzzled, but ignoring him, the Gumiho spoke to Chun Yeowun.\n-There is something interesting down there, Chun Ma.\n“… A talking fox?”\nHis eyes widened even more; he had been through hell and back with Chun Yeowun, but it was his first time seeing a talking fox.\n-What, not satisfied?\nGumiho glared at Baekgi as if she was uncomfortable. Then, the ship shook and a loud roar broke out.\nBang! Thud! Bang!\nThey all looked at the epicenter at the same time.\n“What is that?”\nOn the south side of the auction, where the VIP guests' speedboats were kept. Something huge and long jutted out through the ice, and along it resembled the suckers of an octopus.\n“Kyaaaal!”\n“W-what is this?”\nPeople on the speedboats began to scream. At first glance, the gigantic, thick and squirming tentacles as long as 15 to 20 meters were enough to make anyone scared. The whole creature looked like a large octopus.\nBut,\nShh!\n“Eikk!”\nOn the gigantic suckers along the tentacles, what seemed to be eyeballs were constantly moving!\n“What? A hazard entity?\n“When did a Gate open?”\nPeople had a gut feeling that this was a hazard entity, and unsurprisingly, the entity looked at the ship.\nGrrr!\nThree huge legs squirmed, trying to attack the speed boat with a whip.\n“Ack!”\n“R-run!”\nIt was then.\nA huge tentacle that was trying to hit the ship at first then stopped at the sound of a blow.\nPapapak!\nFrom the top of the ship, someone was approaching the monster at a high speed.\n“A giant octopus is certainly a difficult opponent to adjust to.”\nIt was Kohaku of Speed, who was contemplating stealing the valuable items on the ship but then decided that if he didn’t stop the monster, the ship would be buried there.\nShhh!\nOf course, many others responded to the sudden appearance. Warriors who were famous in their respective nations took out their weapons, including Jack Oren.\n“I just came to participate in the auction, but these annoying events keep occurring!”\nPhat!\nThe man jumped and instantly flew towards the entity that threatened the state of the ship. This was the moment that the ship became a battlefield for the Gate Entity.\nMeanwhile, on the dark ship about 300 meters away, the ship’s searchlights lit up the frozen surface in front.\nPapak!\nThousands of people at the forefront were thawing and throwing bombs at the frozen water, as they wanted to move away as quickly as possible.\n“What happened to the motor?”\n“I’m trying to thaw the frozen parts, but it’ll take another ten minutes.”\n“Fucking shit!”\nIt would take the crew another 10 minutes to break the ice and continue moving. Everyone in the ship looked at Chae Mun-tak, who was peering out at the auction board very far away. More and more tentacles began to pop out from the sea.\nPapapa!\n“It’s grown bigger.”\nIt was much larger than when they had first caught it seven years ago. The Kraken didn’t have a limit to the amount of tentacles, far exceeding the 8 or 10 of the squid or octopus. If\nthat person\nhadn’t been there, they wouldn’t have been able to catch it.\nThud!\nSomeone opened the door to the wheelhouse he was in and entered. A middle-aged man in his forties took off his mask, revealing a grim face.\n“Mr. Cheol-ryeong!”\nIt was Cheol-ryeong.\nThanks to the frozen lake, he managed to run over to the ship without a problem.\n“What happened? Can we move the boat?”\nOne of the crewmates in the wheelhouse answered,\n“If we can resolve the motor issue, it might be possible to operate the ship.”\n“Might? Do you think we have room for possibility right now?”\nCheol-ryeong looked at them and yelled. He had a rough time coming here so he was being impatient.\n“That monster-like bastard might come after…”\n“Be calm, Cheol-ryeong.”\n“Senior researcher?”\n“There’s enough time. Look at that.”\nThe place he pointed to was where the huge tentacles were coming up from the frozen ground. It looked like 12 tentacles were coming out.\nBang!\nWarriors of each nation were guarding their own speed boats but the ships attached to the auction board were destroyed. People who weren’t armed were screaming.\n“It… grew.”\nCheol-ryeong said, shocked. It was no exaggeration to say it grew twice, or even thrice from when they had first seen it. It was originally an A-class Alpha entity, but now, it seemed to have grown into an S-class.\n“Do you think they can deal with that monster in those ten minutes and come after us?”\n“But—”\n“He won’t come for us.”\n“Huh?”\n“The world calls him a hero now.”\nChun Yeowun was heralded as the hero who solved the TRA crisis. Thanks to that, the public saw all of the Yongchun Group and the Sky Demon Order in a good light.\nChae Mun-tak was aiming to take advantage of the fame that Chun Yeowun had.\n“Ah! Chun Mu-seong can’t run away from his reputation.”\n“Those warriors are the kind of people obsessed with fame, especially the ones leading a huge group.”\nChae Mun-tak chuckled. Although it would be a loss if they lost their guests, he was sure they would find more.\n“Not much time is left.”\n5 minutes had passed; just a little more, and they would be out.\nDrrr!\nAt that moment, the ship shook and the engine motors spun. One of the crew shouted,\n“The motor side has been defrosted!”\nAt that, Chae Mun-tak smiled.\n“See that? We don’t have to rush. Once we get out–”\n“R-researcher!”\nWith a pale face, Cheol-ryeong was pointing somewhere, and Chae Mun-tak turned to take a look.\n‘!?’\nSomeone was standing outside the wheelhouse: Chun Yeowun, in the shadows.\n‘W-why is he here?’\nHe didn’t have the time to be shocked as Chun Yeowun quickly put his finger on the window.\nChachacha!\nThe window shattered, sending a flurry of shards inside.\nPapapak!\n“Kuak!”\n“Ack!”\nGlass shards pierced the bodies of the crew members.\n“No!”\nCheol-ryeong tried to protect Chae Mun-tak with his body, but–\n“Stand aside.”\nWhen Chun Yeowun swung his hand,\n“Ugh!”\nKwakwang!\nCheol-ryeong’s body exploded through the wall and flew out. It was surprising, considering how many layers of iron and wood were broken.\n“Cheol-ryeong!”\nHis escort was strong, but not strong enough to counter Chun Yeowun.\n“Worried about him?”\nChun Yeowun motioned as if he were pulling something. Chae Mun-tak’s body, which was about to run away, was dragged towards Chun Yeowun.\nWoong!\n“D-damn it!”\nAt the thought of being caught, he decided to finally display his ability. His right hand glowed red as his left hand shimmered in white frost.\nHis powers demonstrated the duality of heat and cold; he could burn with the right hand and freeze with the left.\n“You idiot.”\nIt was an ability that could work if used as a surprise attack, but Chun Yeowun instantly formed a sword.\nSlash!\n“Ugh?”\nBoth of Chae Mun-tak’s arms were slashed right away. If warriors with decades of training couldn’t bear the pain of their arms being cut, how would an ordinary person given an ability handle it?\n“Kuaaaak!”\nHis screamings seemed to be unending as blood kept flowing. If the bleeding wasn’t stopped soon he would surely die from blood loss, so Chun Yeowun sealed the blood points on his shoulder to stop the bleeding.\nIt was only a temporary measure, however. If the man was left alone, he would die from the shock of bleeding. Chun Yeowun went and sat in the captain’s chair of the wheelhouse, calling for Chae Mun-tak’s body with his hand.\n‘I-is he a God?’\nHe was able to do unbelievable things.\n“You seem ready to talk now. Chae Mun-tak, was it?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, the man bit his lip.\n‘Jo Hogi! That bastard!’\nThere was no one else who would disclose his name. He was worried about everything that that man could have told Chun Yeowun. Chae Mun-tak glanced outside, seeing the auction board in chaos with the Kraken’s legs.\n“W-why… ugh… aren’t you… helping them?”\nChun Yeowun laughed and asked,\n“Why should I?”\n“What?”\nHe was stunned at the answer for a second.\n“I-if you don’t save them… your reputation… will be… damaged…”\nGrab!\nChun Yeowun grabbed Chae Mun-tak by his hair.\n“Kuak!”\n“You seem to be misunderstanding something. In your eyes, do I look like one of the Forces of Justice bastards?”\n‘!?’\n“Why would I want to lose myself in order to save people I don’t even know?”\nAt those words, Chae Mun-tak felt as if he were hit on the head with a hammer.\nHe thought Chun Yeowun was just another Murim bastard who was after name and fame, but this assumption turned out to be a foolish mistake.\n‘T-this man is…’\nUntil the very end, Chun Yeowun only moved according to his own ideals of practicality.\nWhat Baekgi is trying to say here is that Chun Yeowun is a very talented martial artist. A true genius in martial arts.?",

      "content": "Chapter 161: Kraken (2)\n‘How can this be?’\nChae Mun-tak thought that he had been stabbed in the back. Chun Yeowun’s actions thus far seemed to have been very conscious of public opinion, but that was Chae Mun-tak’s fatal misunderstanding.\n‘Ha!’\nChae Mun-tak, who began analyzing things because he couldn’t understand people, wasn’t able to imagine what would happen until he suddenly remembered.\n“Right. This… Since you don’t know others… you are going to let your party die tonight?”\n“Party?”\nFrom the moment Chun Yeowun entered the hotel, Chae Mun-tak kept his eyes on him, knowing all of their identities and capabilities.\n“Did you think that your friends would be fine at the general auction? Your monstrous force was definitely unexpected, but…could the rest of your party survive this predicament”\nChae Mun-tak asked with a pale face. He couldn’t die here, anything but death in vain. He had already instructed the general auction house people to secure Chun Yeowun’s party members.\n“Besides, aren’t some of your people still there?”\nChae Mun-tak glanced at the auction house on board; if Chun Yeowun appeared had suddenly appeared here, then that meant he left his party members on the ship, which Chae Mun-tak planned on using as leverage.\n“Let’s make a deal; I can stop the dangerous Kraken from acting out.”\n“And?”\nChun Yeowun’s voice didn’t change, but Chae Mun-tak continued to talk.\n“If you release me and this ship, I will guarantee the safety of your men.”\n“Safety?”\nOne of Chun Yeowun’s eyebrows rose. Chae Mun-tak spoke more strongly,\n“Otherwise… I’ll die, but your members will become corpses as well!”\nChae Mun-tak was the kind of person who believed that those who were ready to die would always survive. At the very least, he would be able to pressure his opponent this way. However, Chun Yeowun’s reaction was:\nGrab!\n“Ugh!”\nThe hand holding his hair tightened. Chae Mun-tak groaned in pain, feeling as if his head was going to explode.\n“Y-You mean it is fine for your subordinates to die?”\nChun Yeowun smiled in response.\n“You seem to be looking down on my subordinates.”\n“What?”\n“Look again with your eyes.”\nChun Yeowun grabbed his hair once more and lifted him up.\n“Kuak! W-what… huh?”\nChae Mun-tak saw something unbelievable. Something began to rise from the cracks of the shipwreck of the auction house, which was broken in half.\nKukukukuku!\nHuge,\n“K-Kraken…”\nThe huge monster with an innumerable amount of tentacles was on the shipwreck. At this point, there were more than 20 tentacles. As if gravity had disappeared, the Kraken floated up into the air as water dripped down from the creature.\n“Gravity Witch!”\nChae Mun-tak remembered the female secretary Chun Yeowun brought along: the only SS-class Keeper who could control gravity.\n‘That’s the power of an SS-class Keeper?’\nHe always heard of the Gravity Witch’s power, but he never expected that woman to be able to pull out the huge Kraken from the water.\n“No way!”\n“It’s being lifted?”\nThe warriors who were struggling to fend off the tentacles to defend their speedboats were shocked. The woman raised her hands, causing the huge monster to float up.\n“Gravity Witch!”\n“It's the Gravity Witch! Yu So-hwa!”\n“Wowwww!”\nPeople seemed to recognize her. Given her reputation, those familiar with the Gate battles were bound to recognize her. Contrary to such cheers, Yu So-hwa’s expression showed signs of struggle.\n‘Its repulsion force is too strong.’\nIf an object was just strong and heavy, it wouldn't be difficult to lift it. However, since this was an Alpha-level Entity, the repulsion force was becoming increasingly stronger.\nBang!\nThe energy from the Kraken’s body was constantly trying to break past Yu So-hwa’s gravitational field.\nShe shouted to the two people who were next to her,\n“I won’t last much longer, hurry up!”\nShe was communicating to Baekgi and Chun Yeowun’s disciple, Ark Young.\n“Yes, miss.”\n“Be patient for just a little longer.”\nThe two men received orders from Chun Yeowun to deal with the Kraken. Their strategy was simple: if she locked the Kraken with the gravity field, the two warriors could use their strongest, ultimate techniques and bring it down.\n“Aren’t you the descendant of the East God?”\n“Yes, senior.”\n“Then let’s test your skills.”\nPhat!\nBaekgi flew into the air first. He was stronger than he was in the past, as he walked on air to enter the range of the Kraken in an instant. Even Ark Young managed to appear on the Kraken’s other side at the same time.\n‘Thunder Kick!’\nCrackle!\nWhen Baekgi lifted his leg, a vein of lightning formed and struck a huge tentacle. The technique combined his Invisible Kick with Thunder Qi.\nOn the other side, Ark Young prepared his right fist.\nWoong!\nThe wind rose like a whirlwind rustling the air and began to concentrate on one point; this was the unification of energy.\nAlthough he hadn’t reached the Divine Master level at which the technique would reach full completion, he still learned how to utilize it at a rudimentary level from Chun Yeowun.\n“Hah!”\n“Hm!”\nThe pair of subordinates hit the beast at the same time using their strongest powers. A kick with lightning came from above as the punch gathered wind pressure at the center of the Kraken.\n“Amazing!”\n“Was he always such a monster?”\nKohaku and Jack Oren were shocked. They were impressed with Baekgi’s, and it seemed like these two could take down the Kraken.\nHowever,\nPapapak!\nSomething no one expected happened. The eyes on the tentacles of Kraken opened up, and even those between the thorns along its body opened.\n‘!?’\nAt that moment, the kick that reigned down on the Kraken reflected back at Baekgi!\n“That–!”\nBaekgi had to move midair to counter his own attack; the same with Ark Young.The situation instantly turned around, as they were trying to defend themselves from their own attacks.\n“No way…”\n“Isn't that an S-class Alpha Entity?”\nOthers couldn’t hide their shock. This being was able to deflect a powerful attack, which meant it couldn’t be an A-class entity. And if it was an S-class entity, all their lives were in danger.\nDrip!\nYu So-hwa’s face was drenched in sweat. The energy from the Kraken had increased tenfold. Just as she reached her limit,\n“Gooooh!”\nThe Kraken let out a monstrous roar, and the vicious eyes on its body turned towards her as it realized that she was the one holding it up.\n“This!”\nEven before she could say anything, numerous thorns on its body flew towards her.\n“Kyak!”\nShocked by the huge number of thorns, she closed her eyes and braced herself. But,\nPapapak!\nShe heard the sound of something bouncing off, and nothing hit her. She opened her eyes to see what happened,\n“This?”\nShe could make out something that looked like golden hair around her. She couldn’t understand what had happened until she heard,\n-Yah! Hold on tight!\n‘!?’\nWith a puzzled expression, she lowered her head to the place where the sound came from. There it was: in front of her, she could make out a small fox’s butt.\n‘Golden-haired Gumiho!’\nIt was the fox that always stayed on Chun Yeowun’s shoulders.\nThe golden hair around her was its tail, but the surprise didn’t end there.\nGooooo!\nThe golden hair soon dazzled in gold and grew in size.\n“Ahhh!”\nYu So-hwa exclaimed at the sight of the Golden Gumiho that was steadily increasing in size. The huge fox with golden fur and seven tails was in no way inferior to the size of the disgusting Kraken.\nHooooo!\nAt the appearance of the Gumiho, the Kraken let out a strange roar. All the eyes on its body turned to her, seemingly wary of the yokai energy the Gumiho was releasing.\n-What is this little rat from the sewers doing here!\nWoog!\nAs the Gumiho opened her mouth, a sphere formed.\n“W-what is that?”\n“This absurd energy…”\nPeople couldn’t help but feel the intense eeriness from the energy in the sphere.\nThey were surprised by the Kraken’s power, but this new energy flowing out was even more overwhelming.\nPang!\nA beam of light flew from her mouth, enough to create storms everywhere that coalesced at the Kraken.\nKuuuu!\nTo prevent the impact, the Kraken created an invisible barrier with the energy it absorbed from Baekgi and Ark Young, but the yokai energy of the Gumiho was different.\nWave!\nIn an instant, the barrier made by the Kraken was pierced and the beam hit the body of the Kraken.\n-\nKwakwakwa!\nGoooo!\nThe Kraken let out a roar of pain. The tentacles twisted trying to move, but it was to no avail.\n“Ugh!”\nBecause Yu So-hwa was holding onto it with all her might, the Kraken, caught in the gravitational field, couldn’t escape as a hole was drilled through its body.\n“Haaa… Haa…”\nYu So-hwa let out a raspy breath. Without any further movement, the Kraken went limp.\nKwang!\nYu So-hwa was drained, letting the body of the Kraken collapse onto the floor. It was the first time she had ever lifted an entity that turned out to be S-class.\n-Well, you are satisfactory, woman.\nThis outcome was only possible because of the golden-haired Gumiho, who handled the Kraken easily. Yu So-hwa just nodded at the praise.\nWoong!\nSoon, when the work was done, the fox’s body shrunk to its regular size. Who would have imagined that such a cute fox could have caused such destruction?\n-Now, let’s head to the loot!\nThe Golden Gumiho raised its seven tails excitedly and rushed to the fallen body of the Kraken.\n“W-what is… that…”\nChae Mun-tak was at a loss of words when he watched the Kraken die. The sudden appearance of the golden fox ruined everything. Chun Yeowun just clicked his tongue.\n“Tsk tsk, I told her to come out only if it was dangerous.”\n‘!?’\nAt that Chae Mun-tak’s eyes trembled.\n‘That monster is his subordinate?’\nEven though he had conducted several experiments, he couldn’t get any gate entities under his control. Finding out that the fox was under Chun Yeowun and acted according to his orders, Chae Mun-tak’s fear only grew.\n‘T-this man isn’t someone we can control!’\nHe was convinced that if Chun Yeowun wasn’t removed, the entire MS Group’s progress would be disrupted.",

      "content": "Chapter 162: Variable (1)\nThe Kraken, an Alpha hazard entity presumed to be an S-class, died and fell back into the ocean. Everyone had seen it die, and their eyes were filled with greed.\nAn S-class core which was so incredibly difficult to find that it was impossible to set a price, but to Murim warriors, it was the highest treasure.\n‘Where did that monster go?’\n‘Did it disappear?’\nThe energy that suppressed everyone in every direction dissipated as some doubted the identity of the Golden Gumiho, but they couldn’t see the majestic fox anymore so they looked at the Kraken instead.\nBut their attention was only on the Gumiho for a while. Seeing the Gravity Witch, Baekgi, and Ark Young approach the beast, they held themselves back.\n“What is it doing?”\nBaekgi asked, puzzled while looking at the golden fox that was poking through the corpse of the Kraken. Yu So-hwa replied.\n“Probably looking for the core.”\n“Core?”\nBaekgi had no idea about this era’s strange occurrences, and with him coming from the past, it would be even stranger if he knew about the Gates and cores.\nArk Young tried to articulate the ideas in a way that Baekgi could understand.\n“Cores are like a dantian of such beings.”\n“Ah! Got it.”\nBaekgi nodded to show that he understood.\n“That fox too must be a spirit creature then, but it’s unusual for one to be aiming for another spirit creature’s dantian.”\nHearing Baekgi’s words, Ark Young wasn’t sure how to explain the tiny fox’s identity as one of the Three Yokai, which was different from other creatures.\nBaekgi asked Ark Young, who kept answering him,\n“Is that fox my Lord’s pet…?”\n‘!?’\nArk Young was flustered at the question, and tried to change the topic.\n“Ah! I think there was a person Teacher asked me to secure, so I’ll go ahead and check on him first.”\nArk Young looked at the Golden Gumiho searching through the corpse of the Kraken. Even though she looked rather cute, she was very mean to everyone apart from Chun Yeowun.\n‘It would be best not to touch her.’\nPhat!\nArk Young hurriedly moved and headed to the collapsed dome.\nJo Hogi, one of the ten members of MS Group, was still in there with his blood points sealed. He was put in a safe room to avoid the chaos and danger of the fights outside.\n“Why’s he acting like that?”\nBaekgi was puzzled at Ark Young’s suddenly moving away, to which Yu So-hwa whispered,\n“Because he hates talking about the fox. It’s better to not mention it.”\n“Hmm...”\nBaekgi sighed as if he couldn’t understand. However, he figured that if the fox had such immense power, then the outstanding fear of his comrades was justifiable.\n‘How did the Lord tame that fox?’\nHe saw the fox find something the size of a human body that was glowing with a dazzling light.\n“The core!”\nIt was the core of Kraken, an S-class Alpha Entity.\n-Found it!\nThe Golden Gumiho excitedly jumped and licked the core, thinking about using it to recover her energy that was drained and regrow the two tails that had been cut off too.\nShhh!\nThe tails of the Gumiho grew even bigger and wrapped around the core as she began to absorb the vast energy inside it.\nGoooo!\nAs the energy was absorbed, an even stronger golden light shone from her. The fox purred in delight.\nBaekgi who saw the fox’s growth, mumbled.\n“Is it not… a fox?”\nHe couldn’t figure out why it was acting like a cat. Yu So-hwa tilted her head when Baekgi turned somewhere with a darkened expression.\n‘What?’\nYu So-hwa asked Baekgi, who acted strangely,\n“What is it?”\n“The people around us have vanished.”\n“People?”\nConfused, she looked around. As Baekgi stated, the people who were on the speedboats just a moment ago were nowhere to be seen.\n“Where did they all go?”\nThe sea was frozen and the speedboats were stuck, so it didn’t make sense for all of the people to have simply disappeared.\nShh!\nSomeone approached so fast that they left afterimages. It was a middle-aged man with a dark blue hood, sunglasses, and a mustache: Kohaku.\n‘He must be a warrior from the east.’\nBaekgi recognized the technique in an instant, to which Kohaku asked,\n“見たのか?”\n[Did you see that?]\nSince Baekgi didn’t know Japanese so he couldn’t understand, Kohaku tried speaking in horrible Chinese.\n“See that? While back… people disappeared.”\nUnlike them, who had their eyes on the kraken, Kohaku witnessed the people disappearing right before his eyes. They all suddenly vanished as if they were sucked somewhere else.\nRealizing that something strange was happening, Kohaku escaped so fast he looked invisible, trying to give himself enough time to grasp the situation.\n“What’s going on?”\nYu So-hwa frowned at the ominous feeling. Around one hundred and fifty people who came had disappeared in an instant.\n“This!”\nBaekgi hurriedly moved in the direction of the dome. Back at the collapsed safe room, inside was a fainted Jo Hogi.\nShhh!\nArk Young brought him out, checked the pulse, and sighed in relief one he was sure the man was fine. It seemed like he just hit his head during the shaking and fell on the ground.\n“Should I bring him?”\nArk Young carried him over his shoulders and exited out of the safe room, lightly stepping on the broken floor to climb out. Then, he suddenly felt something behind him.\n‘What?’\nThe moment he looked, he suddenly felt a presence behind him.\n‘Behind?’\nArk Young moved back right away.\nKwang!\nThe propulsion from his movement caused part of the dome to collapse, but luckily no one was there.\n‘A Ghost?’\nIt was strange that he couldn’t feel the mysterious entity, but a voice from behind said,\n“I recommend you put down that burden on your shoulders.”\nIt was a slightly hoarse voice with an underlying threatening tone. Ark Young asked without turning his head,\n“And you are?”\n“You don’t need to know.”\n“… if you say that, you must be from MS Group!”\nArk Young stepped forward and tried to use the knocked-up debris as a defense, but in that brief moment, something unknown flew towards them. Confused, Ark Young moved to the side.\nHowever,\n‘!?’\nJo Hogi, who was on his shoulder, disappeared.\n‘What is this!’\nIt didn’t feel like he was pulled away from his hands, but the voice then asked,\n“Where would you like to go?”\n“What?”\nWhoop!\nAt that moment, everything in Ark Young’s sight spun as he felt a strong sense of moving, as if his body was being sucked into something.\nSomething unbelievable happened the moment Ark Young tried to get rid of this foreign energy.\nWheing!\nThere was a cold wind on his skin. It looked like it was nighttime, but he wasn’t sure.\nThe whole area was white and snowy, and even the mountains around were dyed in white. Up until that moment, he had been on a ship in the middle of the sea.\n“Where am I?”\nArk Young opened his eyes and tried to move, but the only thing he could see around him were the mountains covered in snow.\nArk Young opened the phone on his wrist and checked his coordinates. Seeing them, he felt like he had been hit in the head.\n“Ru… Russia?”\nHis location was in the middle of Russia. In the blink of an eye, he went from Shanghai to Russia.\nAt the same time, the dome of the auction house…\nBang!\nPart of the dome was destroyed, along with a loud sound. Debris was thrown in all directions. Someone could be seen through the debris and dust.\nIt was Baekgi.\n‘Where is he?’\nBaekgi, who felt that something was off, witnessed his own eyes Ark Young disappear as if he was sucked somewhere.\nBaekgi attacked the opponent without another thought, but the man suddenly disappeared.\n‘Where?’\nHe tried to detect the man, but at that moment felt something behind.\n“Huh!”\nBaekgi stretched out his hands towards the weird energy.\nPach-chik!\nAt that moment, there was a flash of lightning, causing sparks to scatter everywhere. Baekgi frowned, as his opponent was nowhere to be seen.\n‘Where is he?’\nBaekgi tried to concentrate on finding the opponent. When he felt the foreign energy again, it was exactly where he was standing.\n“Kuak!”\nPhat!\nBaekgi tried to move his body to the side right away, but in that brief moment, the place he was just at shook.\n‘What is this?’\nIt was strange.\nStartle!\nBaekgi kicked towards the unknown energy that he felt. Then he formed the Invisible Kick.\nBang!\nThe area that was hit shattered and broken, but Baekgi’s expression wasn't good. Since he had used the Invisible Kick, he thought he would at least unveil his opponent’s presence, but it was to no avail.\n‘Where is he?’\nBaekgi moved at high speed to find the man.\nAt the western end of the ship, far from Baekgi. The space shook, and a man with curly hair, a white researcher suit, and black horn-rimmed glasses appeared.\n“Haa…”\nDrip!\nBlood dripped from the man’s nose as the veins on his forehead were popping out.\n‘Like a ghost.’\nHe was trying to send Baekgi to a different location, but somehow, Baekgi kept sensing his intent and moving away. He was confident he could send Baekgi away if he had more time, but his brain’s overload from using this ability was too much.\n‘I need to accomplish my mission.’\nThe man looked at the ship that was 300 meters away, where the real body of Chae Mun-tak, one of the MS members, was.\nWoong!\nThe space shook and the figure of the man disappeared.\nChae Mun-tak’s point of view.\nA large number of people were gathered in the wheelhouse, and since there was a very audible roaring and windows being smashed, it wasn’t impossible for them to notice something wrong.\n“Senior Researcher!”\nHowever, they didn’t enter the wheelhouse because Chun Yeowun, who was standing there, had sliced off Chae Mun-tak’s arms.\n‘Among all of them, there is no one who can save me.’\nChae Mun-tak was desperate.\nEveryone was afraid after they witnessed Chun Yeowun’s skills in the dome, now knowing that this man was able to take down the 4th Gen humans.\n“Tell me where you guys are from and what you’re trying to do.”\nChun Yewun deliberately asked the question because no intention of keeping the man alive. All he wanted was for this man to think of the answer.\n“I… I will not say!”\nChae Mun-tak answered, with his face full of fear. He didn’t want to beg for his life when so many of his subordinates were around, to which Chun Yeowun smiled.\n“It doesn’t matter. Who is your lead–”\nIt was then.\nShh!\nThe space shook and someone appeared in the wheelhouse: the man with the curly hair, white researcher suit, and glasses.\n‘Hm?’\nChun Yeowun narrowed his eyes at the sudden appearance of the man, whose movement he couldn’t sense.\nChae Mun-tak’s face instantly brightened.\n“\nE!\n”\nThe curly haired man was one of the 10 MS Group executives, and was one of the two most powerful.\n‘He’s alive!’\nThe reason why Chae Mun-tak was happy was simple. While\nE\nwasn't suitable for combat, he had a space mobility assumed to be at the SS-class level.\nHe had the ability to move not only himself, but also people and even monsters as well with no constraint. Of course, he could only move to places he had been to, and overusing the ability would cause his brain to overload. Nonetheless, it was safe to say he was one of, if not, the best.\n“You all must leave.”\nE\nreached out to those outside the wheelhouse, who all disappeared in an instant.\n‘They really disappeared.’\nChun Yewun frowned at the sight, as his senses confirmed their disappearances when he couldn’t detect anyone around.\n“What are you?”\nAt his question,\nE\nlaughed.\n“Don’t rush me, Chun Mu-seong. Even if you don’t want to, we will meet sooner or later.”\nWith that, he reached for Chae Mun-tak.\n“Who says you can do what you want?”\nChun Yeowun tried to stop it.\n“It's no use.”\nAt that moment, the space shook and\nE\n’s view rotated. He didn’t intend to fight with Chun Yeowun, knowing how strong Chun Yeowun must be if he could deal with Baekgi.\nHis objective was Chae Mun-tak.\nWoong!\nHis view changed to reveal a large hall with a round table in front. Sitting in that hall were four men and one woman, all in white research suits.\nDrip!\n“Kuak!”\nE\nstaggered and grabbed the table, feeling like his brain was going to explode. However, he was able to achieve his purpose.\nE\nspoke to the others in researcher clothes.\n“Haaa… Haa… even\nI\nescaped. What a shitty business. All this hard work just to save the person who ruined our plans…”\nE\nfrowned. It was unpleasant to see the four men staring at him with stern expressions.\n“What’s up with you guys?”\nAt that, the middle-aged man with thin eyes asked,\n“\nE\n, whom… just whom did you bring with you?”\n‘!?’\nE\nturned right away, hearing his heart beating quicker with each passing second.\n“You… how?”\nThe person behind him was none other than Chun Yeowun.\nE\nwas only aiming to bring Chae Mun-tak, so it was no surprise to say he was shocked.\nChun Yeowun smiled and said,\n“It’s been too long, MS Group.”",

      "content": "Chapter 163: Variable (2)\n30 seconds ago,\nChun Yeowun saw\nE\nmove people in front of him, and it was then that he grasped the foreign energy.\nHe was able to quickly realize that this foreign energy was very similar to the ability he had.\n‘Spatial movement?’\nChun Yeowun obtained the ability to move 15 meters in space, deemed teleportation, from one of the demons, which was how he recognized the situation vaguely.\nIn just a few seconds,\nE\nonce again displayed his ability to move through space with himself and another person at the same time.\nWoong!\n‘Now!’\nIn that instant, Chun Yeowun threw Chae Mun-tak to the side and moved to the point the space distorted, giving up spatial control over his body to enter\nE\n’s teleportation. Once his surroundings changed instantly, Chun Yeowun smiled.\n‘I think I’ve figured it out.’\nE\n’s ability was a long-distance spatial movement. This allowed Chun Yeowun to understand the principle beyond teleportation.\nNormally, it was absolutely impossible, but his knowledge of the principle of teleportation and his understanding of space through the realization of the universe played a big role.\n‘H-How did this happen?’\nOn the other hand,\nE\ncouldn’t understand what had happened; the ally he had to bring wasn’t here, but rather the enemy came with him.\n‘Damn it!’\nEmbarrassed,\nE\nshowed his ability by force. As their location was one that only MS Group should know.\n“Go back!”\nWoong!\nHowever, something unbelievable happened. The space where Chun Yeowun was standing distorted and then,\nPhat!\nThe space returned to its original state.\nE’\ns eyes fluttered.\n“H-how?”\nIt felt like his head was going to explode due to the overload of his brain, but he still used his ability. However, when it didn't work at all, he couldn’t hide his agitation. Then Chun Yeowun said to him,\n“I roughly understand your ability.”\n“What?”\nAt that,\nE\nmade an expression of disbelief.\n‘He even tried to figure out my abilities?’\nHis ability wasn’t something that could be understood with common sense.\n“\nE\n!”\nThen through his ears came the voice of one of the men in the research suits behind him. It was just a call, but\nE\nunderstood the intention.\n‘Right!’\nIf there was nothing they could do to the man, they had to at least move their positions far away from him.\nDistort!\nJust one more use of his ability would overload his brain and he might collapse, but at least the situation would be better.\nE\ntried to quickly move the others in the room along with him.\nIt was then.\nTatatak!\n“Uhk!”\nBefore\nE\ncould use the ability again, his blood points were sealed and he passed out. Even Baekgi evaded his ability only a few times. Chun Yeowun, who was overwhelmingly stronger than that, was capable of moving faster than anyone else at such a short distance.\n‘If I turn him into a Ghost, he will definitely be very useful.’\nChun Yeowun understood the principle of spatial movement, but moving others was a completely different matter. If the Ghost could use the spatial movement ability, he would then be able to utilize it without space constraints.\n‘Quite literally the best ability.’\nIt was definitely worth coveting.\nKwakwakwang!\nThe space 3 meters around Chun Yeowun was twisted, and then it was torn from the floor to the ceiling, and the whole part disappeared in a round shape.\n“Hmph! How dare you run wild after coming here!”\nA man in his mid-thirties with brown hair reached out his hand. This was his ability, Compress.\nHis ability allowed him to compress and completely destroy everything in that space. It was a monster-like ability that could reach up to 100 meters, but if that happened, even the people in the conference room would be swept away, so he only showed this much.\n“Good job,\nK\n.”\nThe thin-eyed man praised him. It was unfortunate that Chun Yeowun’s power would be lost when killed, but killing him seemed better than keeping him alive.\n“Wait! Isn’t that\nE\n?”\nAt that moment, a man in a research suit pointed towards the entrance of the conference hall. There was a man lying on the floor in a strange position.\nFrom just the curly hair, it was definitely\nE\n.\n“When did he–”\nTak!\nAt that time, someone placed a hand on\nK\n's shoulder.\nK\nunconsciously turned his head, and Chun Yeowun was behind him.\n“Hiek!”\n“You're doing funny things.”\nFlustered,\nK\nturned his head without even thinking about the distance and tried to use his ability, but,\nGrab! Crack!\n“Kuaaak!”\nChun Yeowun grabbed his wrist and ripped it off his shoulder.\n“Noisy.”\nHe proceeded to grab\nK\nby the face and threw him to the floor.\nKwang!\n“You!”\nAmong those wearing researcher suits, there were not only people with abilities. Among them was a short-haired woman with a pretty good appearance and a mole on her forehead who flew at Chun Yeowun’s neck from behind.\nBut,\n“Huh?”\nHer hand that was swinging the dagger was stopped by Chun Yeowun’s internal energy, and unable to understand what happened, she decided to change her attack.\n‘Then!’\nWheing!\nAt that moment, her hand split open and a barrel machine gun was revealed, firing bullets right away.\nTatatatang!\nShe couldn’t hide her surprise as the bullets that flew for just a few inches were stopped mid-air.\nSh!\nWhen Chun Yeowun lowered his hand, all of the bullets fell to the floor.\n“W-what’s this?”\nChun Yeowun spoke to her, who was shocked.\n“It seems you’re an avatar as well.”\n‘!?’\nShe couldn’t say anything to counter his point because it was true.\nHer code name was\nF\nand she was the one who established the avatar technology, a genius in the development of machines, bioimplants and humanoid androids.\n“You’re lucky.”\n“What?”\nAs soon as she asked, Chun Yeowun’s hand cut through her throat.\nSlash!\nAs her neck was slashed, sparks and wires were revealed and her body crumpled to the floor promptly. Chun Yeowun smiled.\n“I’d like for you to experience decapitation.”\nFrom\nF'\ns mouth, a buffering mechanical voice was heard.\n“This… this… this…”\nIt looked like her speaker was damaged. Chun Yeowun grabbed the head of the avatar and said to Nano,\n‘Track the location.’\n[Yes.]\nIf the avatar was being controlled remotely, then Chun Yeowun thought he could move to the location right away. While the location was being tracked, he could feel different energies flocking nearby.\nIt was probably because of the loud charos happening around him.\nTatatak!\nFootsteps outside the closed door made clacking sounds that could be heard across several rooms. Hearing them, the man with thin eyes said to Chun Yeowun,\n“I advise you to stop right now.”\nIn response, Chun Yeowun chuckled.\n“You don’t seem to understand the situation.”\n“No,\nyou\ndon’t understand it.”\n“What do you mean?”\nAt his question, the man with thin eyes said,\n“Is he in the parlor?”\nBeep!\nA red dot appeared on the table and a voice said,\n-...He is in front of the door of the conference room right now, Senior Researcher\nD\n.\nThe sound was from the speaker on the table, but Chun Yeowun could hear the voice of someone right outside the door. The voice seemed to be quite an important one.\nD\nsaid,\n“We have a little problem, Your Majesty Marquis Albat.”\n‘Marquis?\n’\nChun Yeowun frowned at the title, and the Marquis' voice sounded once more.\n-What’s the problem, human?\n‘Human?’\nChun Yeowun concentrated further on the conversation.\nWho would refer to people as humans?\n“Someone stole the divine item and broke into the conference room. He’s caused everything to go wrong.”\n-This is different from what we agreed to in the contract.\nThe voice was low, and Chun Yeowun could tell it was making the person named\nD\nnervous.\n“W-we didn’t know that he would want the–”\nIt was then.\nPhhhh!\nThe door turned into ashes that scattered, revealing a blonde exotic-looking man wearing a dignified blue suit in the style of European nobility.\nThud!\nWhen the newcomer arrived,\nD\nimmediately knelt down along with the others and said,\n“This lowly human shows respect to His Majesty, Marquis!”\nWithout even replying, the ostentatious man walked into the room. He was simply just walking, but everybody in the room felt an intense intimidation.\nLooking at him, Chun Yeowun asked.\n“Do you guys work with demons?”\nAt the word\ndemon\n,\nD\nlooked shocked.\n‘How did he know?’\nHe had never mentioned anything about the demons, and was perplexed when Chun Yeowun mentioned them. At that moment, the Marquis looked at Chun Yeowun and asked\nD\n,\n“Is this the worm?”\nHe condescendingly called Chun Yeowun a worm, which was welcomed by\nD\n, of course.\n‘Idiot. If you hadn’t come here, you wouldn't have gone through hell.’\nThe being in front of him was superior to humans, and since they couldn’t control them, they made a pact with them instead.\nD\ncarefully replied,\n“Y-yes…”\nSlash!\n“Kuak!”\nBefore he could finish speaking, something had been sliced. At the sound of the blade,\nD\nand the person next to him raised their heads while still kneeling.\n‘!?’\nSomething unbelievable had occurred; Marquis Albat had a bewildered expression with eyes wide open while a black line separated his body vertically.\nThen,\nJjkkk!\nThe body slowly ripped to each side and then collapsed. Black smoke rose from the cut portions and the body turned to ashes.\nD\ncouldn’t hide his shock at the sight. A Marquis of the Demon clan, known as a monster among monsters, had died in an instant.\n“This… no…”\nBehind where Marquis Albat stood, Chun Yeowun stood and said,\n“Why? Were you expecting to run away after throwing him at me?”",

      "content": "Chapter 164: MS Group (1)\nThe moment Chun Yeowun saw Marquis Albat, he felt a considerable power resonating within him. If they had a fight, it would only be a matter of seconds for this place to be devastated, so he chose the neat way.\nOf course, after seeing him kill the Marquis,\nD\nand the other man were at a loss of words.\n‘I-Is he even a human?’\n‘He killed a monster among monsters with a single blow…’\nThey knew about demons and the strength they possessed.\nIt would not be an exaggeration to say demons were comparable to or even stronger than those called the strongest among humans, even at the Count level. Chun Yeowun passed by the ashes that were scattered and walked towards them.\n“What stupid agreement did you make with the demons?”\nChun Yeowun had certainly killed all the traitors of the Demon clan, but the demons kept appearing. Nonetheless, he had somewhat of an idea for their appearances: the one he just killed either came to pursue traitors like Shakena or just had other plans.\n‘Is there a high possibility that it is the former?’\nFrom what Chun Yeowun knew, Shakena was ranked third among the Counts. The chances were high enough.\n“Y-You think we’ll just answer you?”\nWhile the researcher next to\nD\nwas scared, he looked at the combat agents who were surprised behind Chun Yeowun. In response, the combat agents pulled out their guns and shouted at Chun Yeowun. It might or might not work, but it was their duty to protect the executives.\n“D-don’t move! I’ll shoot!”\n“So annoying.”\nThat was all Chun Yeowun said.\nThud!\nAt that moment, cracks appeared on the floor, and dents formed in several places as dozens of agents suddenly disappeared from view.\n“No… how…”\nThe two people’s faces turned pale. They could guess just by looking at the pieces of blood and flesh splattered where the soldiers had just been that they were all crushed to death.\nWhat they were most shocked about wasn’t the lack of screaming during this process, but rather Chun Yeowun who didn’t even blink at using such a crude method.\n“This won’t change anything,”\nD\nsaid, preparing for his death. Chun Yeowun responded as if he didn’t care.\n“It doesn’t matter if you answer me or not. I just need an ear that can listen to me.”\n‘!?’\nAn eerie blue light shone from Chun Yeowun as he approached them.\nMemories began to play like a film.\nInside the laboratory with the words Sector 73 engraved on the wall. There, several researchers wearing full-body sanitary robes were experimenting with exotic-looking naked bodies.\n[Don’t worry about the material flowing through. It will naturally disappear.]\n[Yes, Senior Researcher.]\nThe leaders of this were\nD\nand\nH\n, who were among the 10. They connected various mechanical devices and cut something from the naked man as they observed the reaction.\nBang!\nThe ceiling collapsed and someone suddenly appeared: a person wearing a white hooded cloak with a splendid pattern on it, and those wearing blue European aristocratic clothes on either side of him were his assistants. One of them had a familiar face.\n‘That’s him.’\nIt was a man named Marquis Albat, who had just died in Chun Yeowun’s hands. Due to their sudden appearance, the agents guarding the laboratory immediately stepped forward and surrounded them. Then the man in the middle, wearing a hooded cloak over his head, opened his mouth.\n[You little worms.]\nAs soon as he said that, Marquis Albat raised his hand and the people who surrounded them disappeared as ashes, leaving no one behind.\n[What are you guys?!]\nAmong those wearing sanitary robes, a tall man about 190 cm came out throwing his sanitary mask away. He stretched out his hand, and pulled out a sword out of the scabbard that stood on one side of the lab, a blue haze rose from it and flew towards the intruders.\n‘Supreme Master?’\nSurprisingly, the tall man was a Murim warrior who reached Supreme Master level. The Supreme Master warrior, of which only five were officially in the current Murim, was held by MS Group as an escort to protect the 10. Such a great talent came out, but the result was,\nPsss!\nMarquis Albat, who easily blocked the sword, turned the tall man into ashes at once. The alarm sounded and numerous agents appeared, but the result was the same: everyone was murdered without a chance to do anything.\nSuddenly, the view of the memories started to change again.\n‘Did they come in contact with the demons like that?’\nThe next question Chun Yeowun asked was what kind of agreements were made with the demons. The place had changed. A man in a hooded cloak sat arrogantly in the hall, and those in research suits knelt and spoke to him.\n[As ordered, we will surely bring the traitor.]\nThe one who said this was someone whom Chun Yeowun didn’t get to meet. He was a middle-aged man with short hair and big eyes, giving the impression of a frog and he seemed to be one of the 10.\nBut at his words, Marquis Albat spoke in an uncomfortable tone,\n[Lord! Even so, to entrust these insignificant insects with the divine items that His Majesty has ordered\nus\nto use–]\nBefore he could finish his words, the man in the hooded cloak pulled something out of his pocket.\nIt was the Golden Wheel that the MS Group talked about as if they had found it, but in reality a demon had actually given it to them.\nThe man in the hood said,\n[If you can’t find the traitor after borrowing this, I will erase all of you from this world.]\n[... Is there anything to do?]\n[Take it.]\nHearing those words, the frog-like middle-aged man walked forwards with his head bowed and carefully accepted the Wheel.\nThe hooded man asked the middle-aged man, who took the Wheel and stepped back,\n[What do you want?]\nAs if waiting for the answer, the middle-aged man answered,\n[If you are all-powerful, then you must know what’s in the sky.]\nAt those words, the man in the hood smiled. He seemed to understand what the frog-like middle-aged man was saying.\n‘In the sky?’\nOn the other hand, Chun Yeowun couldn’t understand at all. The middle-aged man continued,\n[Please remove the worst thing that took the sky from us.]\nAt the words, someone other than Marquis Albat, a man with tan skin and blue aristocratic clothes, said with a noble voice, looking outside the window.\n[That is the earnest plea of the bugs that cannot fly even though they have wings, My Lord.]\nEven though these were memories, the demons were all arrogant. They acted as if they were ruling over the humans. The man in the hood opened his mouth,\n[Is that all?]\nWhen the permission was granted, the middle-aged man smiled. At that time,\nD’\ns thoughts were heard.\n‘Will we be able to get the right to offer in our hands?’\nAt the end of the thought, the memory was cut off. As the place changed again, this time it was a space made of black. There was a large round table in the black space, and there were 10 people wearing masks with alphabet letters on them.\n‘Are these guys the 10 executives?’\nThe next question Chun Yeowun asked was about their purpose.\nIt was obvious that the reason they were reaching out to so various places behind the scenes was because they had an objective. At the round table, a voice came out from a masked person named\nA\n.\n[Welcome to being a member of the 10,\nJ\n.]\nIt was a mechanical tone from a hard, cold voice with no emotions. The person\nA\nwas looking at was\nD\n.\n‘So he wasn’t 'D' from the beginning.’\nJo Ho-gi said that a total of ten executives leading the MS Group were referred to as the 10. There were many other researchers besides them, but these people were the ones he remembered as being the center of the MS Group.\nHowever, they didn’t seem to have an equal relationship.\n[Your research paper on DNA extraction and fossil restoration published in science journals is highly appreciated by myself and the others.]\nAt that,\nJ\n, who was\nD\nin the present, got up and bowed to express his gratitude.\n[That is an exaggeration, Commander.]\nIn response,\nB\n, who was next to\nA\n, said,\n[At the round table, call only by code name.]\n[Ah… I understand.]\nD,\nwho was called\nJ\n, cautiously answered.\n‘He’s the one.’\nThanks to this, Chun Yeowun knew for sure that\nA\nwas the leader as\nA\nspoke again.\n[\nJ\n’s research achievements will play an important role in achieving our tasks in the future. For this group’s long-awaited goal, all 10 members should support him.]\n[Yes!]\nEveryone answered simultaneously. Chun Yeowun still couldn't understand what the purpose of this could be. However, the words\nA\nsaid next made Chun Yeowun's mind blank for a moment.\n[Never stop until the moment we actualize and bring forth the true God: the source of mankind.]\n[Yes!]\nThey all responded vigorously as if they were a cult.\n‘God?’\nWhat was the meaning of\nA\n's words just before?\nWhat Chun Yeowun knew as God was the Sacred Fire and the Demon God that the cultists worshipped in the Sky Demon Order.\nOf course, other than that, there were the Jade Emperor and the Three Pure Ones in Taoism, Tathagata in Buddhism. God was a transcendent being.\nHowever, with their own mouths, the executives declared that their purpose was to embody, create such a being.\n‘What are they up to?’\nChun Yeowun felt entirely baffled. It would be more realistic if they wanted China in their hands or to become the masterminds behind the world’s affairs..\n‘They are all crazy…’\nThese people were more absurd than any enemy he had met before. According to the knowledge from Nano, science and technology were said to be created for the development of mankind, but these people were now looking beyond the realm of God and beyond God itself.\nShh!\nSuddenly, the memory changed again. A number of different places came to mind. These were the locations of the labs that they called sectors.\n‘Are these all?’\nThe places of about thirty bases were imprinted in his mind. However, among the 10, there were only three sectors that\nD\nknew.\nPhat!\nChun Yeowun opened his eyes. This was all the information he got from\nD\n's Ghost.\nA\n’s base, the most important one, was unknown.\n“You.”\n“Eik!”\nChun Yeowun looked at the man in the research suit, who was trembling.\n“What’s your code name?”\nNormally, the man would have chosen death, but after seeing Chun Yeowun turn\nD\ninto a Ghost, he was terrified.\nTerrified, he wasn’t able to answer.\n“Realize God? Crazy bastard.”\n‘!?’\nThe man’s eyes widened at Chun Yeowun’s words. Only the 10 executives knew of MS Group’s ultimate goal. Numerous people had been replaced but even then their purpose wasn't revealed because leaving the group entirely meant death.\n‘H-How does he know? Could it be from when he put his hand on D's head after turning him into a Ghost?’\nThe man was a genius; just by seeing Chun Yeowun’s actions, he was able to realize what happened, and the fact that he guessed it put an even greater pressure on him.\n‘And if I’m killed, will he be able to search through my memories?’\nIf so, was there even any meaning to being loyal and keeping his mouth shut?\nShhh!\nThe corner of Chun Yeowun’s lips rose. This man had realized exactly what Chun Yeowun was intending for, and it certainly helped him.\nPuk!\nWoong!\nChun Yeowun had his hand on the chest of\nD\n’s Ghost, which made a groaning sound. In that state, Chun Yeowun raised his energy.\nPang!\nThe Ghost vanished without a trace.\n‘!!!’\nThe man’s eyes widened in shock at what he saw. After seeing the Ghost being dispelled, he knew that Chun Yeowun could even kill the ghosts.\n“From now on, I won’t be asking twice. Next time, that will be you.”\nAs soon as he said that, the man shouted.\n“My code name is\nH\n!”\nFinally the mouth opened.\n“Do you know the base of the other 10,\nA\nin particular?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s question,\nH\ntrembled and said,\n“I don’t know the others’, only\nD\n’s lab, Sector 4; my lab, Sector 8; and\nF\n’s lab, Sector 6.”\nAt those words, Chun Yeowun was happy to realize one thing; in his memory,\nG\n’s sector was revealed.\nIn that case, Chun Yeowun knew the information of seven people:\nD\n,\nE\n,\nF\n,\nG\n,\nH\n,\nI\n(Chae Mun-tak) and\nJ.\n“So the others don’t have code names?”\n“S-some of the mid-level researchers who are skilled are given code names.”\n“Hmm.”\nIn other words, it meant that the one called\nK\nwas a candidate for 10.\n“How about\nB\nand\nC\n?”\n“Even among the 10, there is almost no interaction to keep the secrets among them, and they can meet through the virtual roundtable.”\nThat was true. According to the memory of the deceased, only if their research overlapped did they visit the other sectors.\n‘He doesn’t know any important information.’\nChun Yeowun clicked his tongue. The most effective way would be to get rid of the head, but his identity was unknown.\n‘That would be nice.’\nChun Yeowun thought of a simple strategy. He didn't know if it would work, but he wanted to give it a try.\n“What are you doing here?”\nAccording to\nD’\ns memory, the 10 had an important role in MS Group, and if so, their achievements would surely reflect in their sectors.\n“T-that…”\n“I told you I won’t ask twice.”\nHearing that,\nH\nguided him.\nH\n, who was hurt and bleeding, led him outside the room and touched a place with no buttons with his thumb, making a beeping noise.\n[Going down to the basement lab.]\nWheing!\nThey went down the elevator for about 30 seconds.\n‘Energy is around.’\nChun Yeowun sensed about 30 people right outside, but they weren’t very skilled Murim warriors or anything. As the elevator opened, a bright LED caught his eyes and a space with numerous mechanical devices was revealed.\n‘Wide.’\nAt first glance, it was large enough to fill thousands of people; hiding this underground was a huge task. When\nH\ntook the lead, two guards at the front let them pass without any checks.\n‘Maybe all of them are researchers.’\nThis place was a lab filled with people in white coats wandering as they spoke or did their work. However, Chun Yeowun looked elsewhere.\n‘!?’\nThe lab was around three stories high and had numerous capsule shaped objects with living people suspended in blue liquids.\nHe could understand that they were experimenting on humans, but…\n“What are you people doing here?”\nIn the numerous capsules were people with the same, unmistakable face.\nIt was impossible to have so many twins, and the face they shared was of:\n“Sayogi!”\nThey were all Sayogi, whom Chun Yeowun turned into a Ghost.",

      "content": "Chapter 165: MS Group (2)\nThere were dozens of humans in large capsule-like machines, and they all had the faces of Sayogi.\nNot only did their faces look identical, but also their naked bodies seemed almost identical except for a few subtle differences.\n“Ha.”\nChun Yeowun was just speechless, and undoubtedly shocked at the same “thing” captured in the many capsules.\n‘What the hell.’\n[This appears to be clone technology.]\nAt that moment, Nano’s voice answered.\n‘Clone technology?’\n[Clone technology is a technology that produces human bodies of the same individual through gene analysis and DNA replication.]\nPrrrr!\nHis head trembled as the information was transferred to his brain. Clone technology was simply cloning but it was strictly prohibited ethically and legally, even in Nano’s time despite the sufficient technological prowess.\n‘To clone a human…’\nIt was something Chun Yeowun, who lived according to his own will, couldn’t understand. He believed that human beings were born with a purpose.\nThe Heavenly Killing Star, Sayogi, had the physical potential of a killing machine that even the Heavenly Body couldn’t measure up to, and the fact that so many people were mass-produced raised a few doubts in Chun Yeowun.\n“You.”\n“Yes!”\nH\n, who was watching from behind, responded quickly. The sector’s secret wasn’t disclosed to anyone thus far, so he could understand Chun Yeowun’s reaction as it was a study that everyone could criticize.\n“You guys, did you plan on making an army made of Heavenly Killing Stars?”\nH\ndidn't answer, making Chun Yeowun release his vicious energy.\n“Yes, that was our goal.”\nFlustered,\nH\nimmediately answered out of the fear of losing his life. They had produced any human life they wished for their own purpose, but there was no way that they thought this was morally sound.\n“Quite absurd.”\nJust one Heavenly Killing Star was dangerous, and it was no exaggeration to say that the idea of mass-production of such a human would cause the end of the world.\n“You guys thought you could create Heaven… ha!”\nAs he walked forward, Chun Yeowun exclaimed as he looked at the capsule in the back, assuming that all the capsules were of Sayogi.\nHowever, he was wrong.\nIn the back row, there were dozens of clones with the same face as Mun Il-hyang, the head of Oshin Group, but they looked like they were in their mid-20s.\n“Were you people…”\nChun Yeowun looked at the rest of the rows as well. As he approached the back rows, all of the clones seemed to be in their 20s, looking youthful; there was even Kwak Woon, who died at the hands of Chun Yeowun as one of the Five Great Warriors.\n“Crazy bastards.”\nIt was obvious that he didn’t have to look back. He cloned most of the warriors of current Murim.\nIt seemed like they were doing this because they had different bodies, and the things they were doing were disgusting even for those working there.\n“You.”\n“Yes!”\n“You guys are clearly misunderstanding something.”\n“Yes?”\n“If you make a large number of cloned warriors in this way, do you think they’ll have the same physical capabilities as the original ones?”\nChun Yeowun considered the cloning efforts foolish. Even if their bodies were replicated, the Five Great Warriors reached their higher state after decades of training and realization, and it would be impossible to create such warriors from clones.\n“You seem to be looking down on Murim warriors.”\nThere was no point in creating hundreds of them. Artificially created warriors wouldn’t have the training or passion, so from where would they get their strength?\nClick!\nIt was then that a voice came from the speaker in the lab.\n-You came all the way here.\n‘!!!’\nIt was a voice Chun Yeowun had heard before. No, to be more accurate, it was a voice he vividly remembered from reading someone’s memories.\nH’\ns face turned pale.\n“C-Commander!”\nThe voice from the speaker was the head of MS Group,\nA\n.\nH\nwas perplexed when he heard\nA\n’s voice.\n‘Where is he?’\nChun Yeowun opened up his senses to find out where the man was, but realizing Chun Yeowun’s intentions,\nA\nsaid,\n-You can’t find me.\nAs soon as the words were said, something unexpected happened.\nPang! Pang!\nSuddenly, an explosion sounded within the researchers walking around the lab. As they looked, there were explosions inside their bodies, glowing red signs of head, and cracks on their skin.\nShhh!\nThen, all of the researchers fell down like ashes fluttering. It happened to not just one person, but all of the researchers at the same time.\nThey didn’t even have the time to realize that they were dying before their bodies fell over. Chun Yeowun had seen this before:\n‘Nano bomb!’\nWhen a nano bomb exploded inside the body, this was the kind of death that ensued. The presences of the people were completely wiped, and the lab felt empty.\n“A-All of them were killed…”\nH\nwas stunned at the sight of the researchers turning into ash. All of them were outstanding people in the field, and it was heartbreaking to see such people killed without hesitation.\n“Euk!”\nThen something unexpected happened: a strong dizziness and feeling of abnormality crept throughout his body.\n‘N-No! My body too?’\nSince he was a member of MS Group, once he was pushed into the executive position, he had went out of his way to rid of all the bombs in the body.\n“I-I removed them though?”\nHowever, reality was harsh.\n-The absence of explosives doesn’t mean that all the nano machines in the body were eliminated.\n“H-How do you know?”\nHe could think of a couple things, but he could not think much with the pain he was going through as his internal organs were hurting and bleeding.\n-Pay the price for bringing in the enemy inside.\n“Commander!”\nH\n, who felt a sense of betrayal, shouted with a face full of despair as something rang in his ear.\nSnap!\nWith the sound of a finger snapping, the pain in his body disappeared.\n‘!?’\nH\nmade a face displaying his inability to understand what happened when Chun Yeowun snapped his finger.\n-... Interesting. Interfering with frequencies by snapping your finger.\n“F-frequency?”\nH\n, who luckily saved his life, looked at Chun Yeowun in awe. Chun Yeowun was a little skeptical, but was fortunate to have succeeded.\n‘There was the chance the frequency that activates the nano bomb is the same.’\nThe main frequency wavelengths controlling the nano bombs in the MS Group and those of Chun Yeowun were the same, causing interference with the frequency coming out.\n-Even then, you won’t be able to get anything from there.\nCrackle! Papang!\nWith\nA’\ns voice, the computers in the lab sparked up as their internal circuits were all burned. Measures were always taken to dispose of unimportant places in case something happened.\n“You must be afraid of being found.”\nChun Yeowun provoked\nA\nas he was trying to destroy everything.\nA\n, with the altered voice, answered.\n-This is a reasonable measure.\n“Do you think cutting off your tail will keep you hidden?”\n-You will not find us.\n“Quite overconfident.”\n-You will die there.\nWith those words, the capsules holding the clones all opened at once.\nPapapak!\nA gooey blue liquid spilled out from the opened capsules as numerous clones slumped. Tubes inserted in their heads, necks, and spines kept them suspended within the capsules.\nWoong!\nA loud mechanical whirring sound came from all around.\nH\nquickly said to Chun Yeowun in an urgent voice.\n“W-we need to get out of here right now!”\nH\nknew what was happening, and the perfected clones that were attached to the ceiling only made the situation worse.\nGoo!\nChun Yeowun looked down, feeling the energy right below the site.\n“The core.”\nThe energy from the core was coming from below, but it wasn’t just the energy from the core that he was feeling. It was the energy of the core being injected into the clones.\nPrrrr!\nAs energy was injected to the tubes, the clones began to fall.\n‘No!’\nH\n, unlike Chun Yeowun, wasn't a Murim warrior, so he couldn’t feel anything that was happening, but since he had developed the control of the place’s core, he knew what would happen.\n‘He plans to stop the monster and blow this up!’\nH\nwas in panic.\n“The commander is trying to wake them all up and kill us. Even if we were to beat them, if the core control unit below this explodes, a radius of 2 to 3 kms will be destroyed!”\nEven a monster wouldn’t be able to stop the release of the explosive energy.\nA’\ns voice came out through the speaker.\n-Even if you recognize it, it’s already too late. Soon this will be your grave…\nWoong!\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun’s figure disappeared as if seeping into the air.\nA’\ns voice, which was speaking through the speaker, stopped.\n‘!?’\nH\ncouldn't help but feel flustered. He had seen people get sucked into space countless times through\nE’\ns ability. For a moment, he thought it was ridiculous, but he ended up saying his thoughts.\n“Fuck! Did you just use spatial movement alone and leave me here!?”",

      "content": "Chapter 166: MS Group (3)\n[Angel:\nHi! I’m the new 2nd editor for DOTDG. Happy to be part of the team! Enjoy reading!\n]\n“Damn it!”\nSince their relationship had been hostile from the beginning, Chun Yeowun had no obligation to rescue him. However,\nH\nwas dismayed at the thought that the person had left him.\nMeanwhile, a total of 420 surveillance cameras that were installed in the lab were moving, trying to figure out the location of Chun Yeowun.\nH\nsaid that it was a Spatial Movement but\nA\ndidn’t seem to believe it. There were cameras everywhere in the lab. Unlike general sectors, these cameras had various functions.\nWheing!\nThe cameras searched every nook and cranny, but Chun Yeowun was nowhere to be seen. However, there was one place without cameras. That was where the core control unit linked to the main system. So it wasn’t a place where Chun Yeowun could enter either.\nIt was then,\nCrackle!\nThe sound of sparks bursting. With that, the sound of the motor running which had made the entire laboratory deafening, gradually diminished.\n“N-No.”\nH\nlooked down. The floor where the sound of sparks was heard turned still and not long after.\nBang!\nSomeone came up with a roar from the floor.\nThat person was Chun Yeowun.\n“Ugh!”\nH\n’s face, who thought Chun Yeowun had escaped earlier, contorted. He was aware of\nE\n's ability which could be used when he had been to the place before but what Chun Yeowun did was different.\n‘How did he get down there?’\nOf course, it was because of the teleportation ability that Chun Yeowun had absorbed from the demon. The teleportation ability was a short distance movement. Although it was only 15 meters, he was able to move around the place.\n-You…\nIt was the first time that\nA\nsounded flustered. The energy of the core, which had been activated as if it would explode any moment, was gone.\nChun Yeowun spoke.\n“I am thankful. Not that it is necessary, but thanks to you I got a lot of stuff.”\nOf course, it was Chun Yeowun who took the cores in the control unit. He went down and took away all 3 S-class cores, 13 A-class cores and 27 B-class cores.\n“I’ve picked up a lot.”\nThere was no reason to not loot it, so it was put in the shadows.\nFlick!\nThe LED lights in the lab began to flicker. All of the energy inside itself was returned to the core control unit and converted to reserve power.\n“Done!”\nH\nlet out a relieved sigh. Chun Yeowun's fast thinking allowed him to avert both the activation of clones and the explosion of the lab at the same time.\n“Shall we find out where you are?”\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun's figure disappeared in front of the cameras and then reappeared. The Gatelinium line came out and linked to the camera as he grabbed it with his hand.\n‘Nano, track it.’\n[Yes.]\nThere was a location where they could control the cameras and lab.\nHowever, the instant Nano attempted to hack.\nPang!\nThe camera exploded.\nAs Chun Yeowun judged that\nA\ndid it, he immediately moved to another camera 5 meters away. At that moment, that camera exploded too.\n‘Look at this one.’\nHe was blocking any way in advance to be tracked down.\nThen\nA\nsaid,\n-My prediction turned out to be true. I'm not sure how you achieved it, but by simply touching a machine, you have a degree of hacking expertise that exceeds that of any professional hacker. That's how you were able to find us.\nAt those words, Chun Yeowun narrowed his eyes.\n‘He’s cool headed.’\nChun Yeowun's enemies would either panic or rush ahead to strike, and they frequently exhibited gaps. This one, on the other hand, was cold-blooded. He was instead analyzing Chun Yeowun.\n‘I should kill him.’\nChun Yeowun decided that\nA\ncould be a nuisance to him. The criterion for judging him in this way was because of the safety of Sky Demon Order rather than for himself.\nA\ndeclared war to Chun Yeowun.\n-As expected, you are an existence who has to be killed.\n“Funny. I was thinking the same thing.”\n-I really want this place to be your grave.\nPapapa!\nAt the end, all the cameras in the lab had exploded along with the speakers. And the remote devices were broken. As a result, Chun Yeowun couldn’t pursue him any longer.\nTak!\n“\nChit\n!”\nHis eyes were irritated, as if he had lost sight of the main head that was directly in front of him. However, it was evident that this tragedy had given MS Group serious damage. It was stated that the 10 sectors overseen by the 10 people in MS were crucial.\nThud!\nThe sound of something falling. At that, Chun Yeowun turned his head to the place. A naked man with blue liquid on him.\nIt was a clone of Sayogi.\n“W-wasn’t he… dead?”\nThe energy was cut off, but then this man had his eyes open and the evil energy could be seen from the eyes.\nIt didn’t stop there.\nPak!\nThe tubes moved as the clones, whose tubes were fixed, opened their eyes and struggled.\n‘Damn it! They seem to have energy within.’\nH\ncouldn’t hide his shock at that appearance. They thought that since the energy stopped flowing then the clones couldn’t be activated any longer. But then all the clones were looking at Chun Yeowun and\nH\n.\n“Chun, Mr. Chun. What do we do?”\nH\nlooked bewildered and scared at what happened. He knew that Chun Yeowun was the only one who could fight.\nTak!\nThe clones moved.\nHowever, contrary to Chun Yeowun’s expectations that they were born in capsules and couldn’t have combat powers...\nWoong!\nBlue colored energy fluttered from the hands. Just by looking at it, he knew that they had to be Super Master level.\n“Energy?... What did you people do?”\n“Now isn’t the time to ask all these…”\nWhen Chun Yeowun looked back with a cold gaze,\nH\n, answered.\n“W-we developed a chip which contains information about the battles and martial arts of people of murim.”\nThey developed a learning system to assist the clones in adapting. A method of transmitting data via inserting chips into the brain. A lot of materials and techniques on martial arts were embedded and refined so that it could be applied naturally.\n“T-the development hasn’t progressed enough to be commercialized yet. Even if the chip takes over the learning function, we can’t keep it up physically…”\n“So you mean that the body was created with the DNA of strong warriors?”\nH\nnodded at Chun Yeowun who understood it at once. It was possible to create and experiment with the body of an ordinary person, but they didn’t want to end it with that and the clones were created.\n“\nTch tch\n.”\nChun Yeowun was a bit impressed with it. The end of their technology would be making someone like Chun Yeowun. To transmit all the information to the brain and analyze martial arts.\nBesides, the nano machine in Chun Yeowun helps the body match the martial arts. But since these people didn’t have those chips in their possession, they utilized clones.\nPhat!\nAt that time, the clones which fell, moved at the same time. Rather than an organized movement, they all aimed for Chun Yeowun and\nH\n.\n“Eik!”\nChun Yeowun immediately looked at the techniques the clones were unfolding.\nThe technique wasn’t simple, in particular, the clones of Sayogi were unfolding the swordsmanship which he actually did in the past.\n‘They aren’t techniques which need any kind of enlightenment. But, does it mean that they can use the techniques and its power to the maximum too?’\nPapapak!\n“Ueak! Mr. Chun!”\nH\nbowed his head and shouted at the clones which were rushing in. He thought he was going to die for sure.\n“This is the limit.”\nSch!\nChun Yeowun raised his hand and then lowered it. That moment,\nKukukuk!\nThe clones rushing towards Chun Yeowun knelt on the floor at once. Almost three hundred clones.\nEven if they were supplied with the energy of the core, or a chip in their brains, they were nothing for Chun Yeowun.\n“… Oh my.”\nH\n, who opened his tightly closed eyes, was startled. He knew Chun Yeowun was a monster, but he never dreamed that he could see this happen.\n“You can't accomplish anything on your own without realization.”\nThere was a limit to what a body which only had a theory could handle the technique and qi. The more complex the energy had to be manipulated, the more one had to be enlightenment, and such clones couldn’t have that done.\n‘But it’s definitely a dangerous one.’\nThe clones were stronger than humanoid weapons. Considering that there weren’t so many people in the world who were strong in martial arts, mass-producing such stuff was a danger.\nThousands or ten thousands of warriors in Super Master level made-like clones could take down a lot of people.\n‘Is that why they collected so many cores?’\nChun Yeowun now understood why MS Group was obsessed with cores. And\nH\nsaid,\n“You must kill all of them. After all, they listen to the one who gave orders to them.”\nThere was no reason to spare them. Chun Yeowun rolled up his right sleeve and said,\n“Throwing away such power isn’t right.”\n“Huh?”\nChachacha!\nThe wrist guard on Chun Yeowun’s wrist disassembled and turned into the Sky Demon Sword. As he grabbed it, he slammed it into the ground.\nPak!\nA blue colored Ghost rose from the sword and permeated into the floor. It spread like ice as the floor turned white and faded like frost. And eventually, reached the kneeling clones.\n“Kuak!”\n“Kuak!”\nThe clones convulsed and soon their bodies turned white. Eventually, Ghosts were created from the clones’ bodies.\n“No way!”\nWatching that,\nH\nwas at a loss of words.\nIt was because in front of his eyes were Ghosts. But the funny thing was…\n“They are all like Sayogi.”\nFifty Sayogi clones were now Ghosts. The Ghost Qi and the Blood Killing Energy were giving out a creepy purple energy.\n“Well… this much should be enough.”\nChun Yeowun was quite satisfied. Two hundred and fifty Ghosts and fifty Heavenly Killing Star clones were now acquired.\nThud!\nIn front of Chun Yeowun,\nH\nfell down like a lightning and begged.\n“P-Please accept me! I’ll give all the knowledge I have and the information you want, so please let me serve you!”\nIn addition, he gained one of the ten members of MS Group.",

      "content": "Chapter 167: MS Group (4)\nThere was a space with an area measuring about 39 square meters. The walls were decorated with orchids and flower pots while the middle of the room carried an old-fashioned desk.\nSitting at the desk was a man in his early 30s with his eyes closed. His face, however, was not unfamiliar, as it closely resembled that of Sayogi. His closed eyes instilled a feeling of stillness and calmness.\nShhh!\nThe man opened his eyes and looked at the entrance.\nWheing!\nThe automatic door at the front of the room opened and someone entered. It was a woman wearing white research coat and a silver mask with only two eyes and the letter 'C' on it. The woman in the mask said to the man who was sitting,\n“Elder Cho.”\nWas she calling such a younger man an Elder?\n“It’s difficult getting used to calling you\nelder\n; it’s really awkward.”\n“If that’s too hard, just call me Sir Yushin.”\nAt his words and tone, the woman in the mask seemed flustered. He was speaking in a kind voice that masked the obvious fact that he wasn’t such a nice human being.\n‘He’s trying to test me.’\nElder Cho didn’t give his name to just anyone. In fact, even the 10 executives never mentioned his name, but despite this he still held the position of commander.\n“How could I ever do that?”\n“Huhuhu.”\nIn contrast with his youthful appearance, he burst into laughter reminiscent of an old man. The man was indeed Cho Yushin, not long ago he looked much closer to his age.\n‘His body went through reconstruction, or exuviation, by activating and reversing his aging cells. By comparing his blood samples this time, we’ll definitely understand the process.’\nHer eyes were smiling. By studying Elder Cho, they managed to make a lot of progress and actually had a chance to get their desired results this time.\n“Alright. What do you have to say after coming here and ending my meditation?”\nShe promptly answered his question,\n“I was told to bring the guests from the guesthouse.”\n“Oh, the guests?”\n“Yes.”\nElder Cho stroked his chin, shaking his head in disappointment at his beardless chin.\n“Huhuhu. I can never get used to this.”\nElder Cho felt weird that his beard didn’t exist anymore and said,\n“The new non-humans will also come?”\n“Yes.”\nElder Cho, seemingly interested in that answer, got up from his seat. At that,\nC\nmasked woman immediately guided him into the mechanical corridors reminiscent of a ship’s that were equipped with automatic movement devices. After moving along for 10 minutes, a large entrance with a colorful pattern engraved with the word MS suddenly appeared.\n-\nWheing!\nThe doors opened on both sides.\nUpon entering was a round table with five people waiting. Elder Cho looked at a figure wearing a hood who was sitting at the top, noticing another one in an old European blue robe.\n“It’s funny seeing you without your usual flair. Hehe.”\nAt Elder Cho’s words, the person in the hood spoke in a puzzled voice,\n“Human… you look younger.”\n“Younger is better. There is a difference in movement.”\n“…”\nThe eyes from the hood seemed sharper.\n‘He seems to have gotten stronger.’\nThe hooded man’s eyes were clearly on alert. These two beings had crossed with one another before, and the interaction was so violent that not a sector but an entire area was blown away.\n“Sit down, Elder Cho.”\nC\nintervened between them, guiding Elder Cho to an empty seat. On top of the round table was a nameplate made of crystal, engraved with the name\n1st Guest\n. There were four such plates numbered until the\n4th Guest\n.\nAt that moment, the back screen in the back of the room turned on and someone appeared.\n“Commander.”\nC\n, who was standing, bowed her head to\nA\n, the man on the screen. Seeing\nA\n, the middle-aged man in red with sunglasses in front of the crystal plate naming him\n2nd Guest\n, said,\n“Why must I see your face through this screen again, Commander?”\nHearing the 2nd Guest,\nA\nbowed his head and said.\n“We ask for your understanding for our communication through virtual imaging, but it is because there is a problem.”\nHe was apologizing but with a stiff tone. There was no change in emotion, but everyone seemed fine with the apology. On the other hand, Elder Cho was looking at\nA\nquestioningly.\n“What were we called for, human?”\nThe person in the hooded cloak asked\nA\nwith an unwelcome voice. In response, on the screen displaying\nA\n, the display changed to show the word ‘Demon’ engraved in red on someone’s face.\n“This…”\nThe attention of Elder Cho went to the man on the screen: Chun Yeowun, a tall young man with white face and sharp eyes. He was known to them as Chun Mu-seong of the Yongchun Group.\n“Demonic Cult.”\nThe word ‘Demon’ was a mark for those from the Sky Demon Order. In addition to Elder Cho, the man in glasses seemed interested in the man as well.\nConversely, the woman wearing two contrasting colors who sat in front of the hooded cloak, sitting undeniably behind the crystal plate saying\n3rd Guest\n, remained indifferent.\n“What\nabout\nhim?”\nA\nanswered Elder Cho’s question.\n-This person is Chun Mu-seong, the real leader of the current Demonic Cult, and he is the Chun Ma.\n“Chun Ma!?”\nElder Cho was shocked at the mention of the title.\nC\n, too, was puzzled because it was her first time hearing this news.\n“Hehehe, the Chun Ma was born on this land amidst those filthy people?”\nElder Cho couldn’t believe it; the Demonic Cult was way too weak compared to the past, and he believed that they weren’t even worth dealing with.\nPik!\nThen,\nA\nchanged the large screen to display numerous photos.\nThey were photos taken directly on the location where MS Group and Chun Yeowun had fought in the past, and among them, one image caught Elder Cho’s eyes.\n‘Sayogi?’\nThe old man’s expression hardened at the image of Sayogi fighting giant monsters.\n‘He was fighting a Gate entity?’\nElder Cho was the one who took interest in Sayogi for a very long time, raising and teaching him enough to rival against Murim’s strongest warriors. However, the range of images showed his defeat.\n‘Is that… Sayogi?’\nIn addition, Chun Yeowun had taken down the worst TRA entity. Red light shone in Elder Cho’s eyes.\n“The Sky Demon Sword!”\nHe didn’t really trust\nA’\ns words initially, but the moment he saw this sword, he knew he was speaking the truth.\n‘He… must have killed Sayogi.’\nAs the red light coming from Elder Cho’s eyes flickered, the air around him became noticeably heavy. The aura was dangerous enough to make normal people faint, but the guests didn’t falter.\n“Arisha’s Sword!”\nAt that moment, the figure in the hood jumped up. His two eyes, which were indifferent until then, couldn’t move from the sword in Chun Yeowun’s hand.\n“What is that sword?”\nThe man in the European-style attire, who was behind the hooded figure, was also surprised. The two of them looked at each other.\nPick!\nNumerous images flew in succession, allowing them to keep observing Chun Yeowun. The last image displayed an analysis of Chun Yeowun’s ability.\n[Chun Mu-seong\nSocial status: Vice chairman of Yongchun Group\nDemonic Cult status: Chun Ma\nLevel: Estimated to be a Heavenly Master\nWeapon: Sword seems like his main weapon but also handles blades. In addition, he's also good at close combat\nAbilities: Ability to hack and track machines he comes in contact with, and the ability to move through space\nOthers: Can handle Thunder Qi, Fire Qi and Ice Qi.]\nAlthough it was a simple analysis, it was a no-brainer that he was a monster. Even Elder Cho couldn’t take his eyes off the Heavenly Master level; it was said that only five people in the history of Murim were able to climb to that level, and this man was one of them?\n“Heavenly Master level…? Are you saying that a monster this powerful was never found before?”\nThe red-haired man in sunglasses asked. His shocked eyes told everyone that he knew what this all meant. It was intimidating that one person possessed such dangerous abilities.\n“Why are you showing us this person?”\nIn response to the question,\nA\nsaid,\n-This person cannot coexist with our group. Therefore, MS Group has officially declared war with him.\n‘War!?’\n‘War’ carried a huge meaning. Of course, words like ‘kill’ would have made more sense, but ‘war’ meant that this man was their strongest opponent thus far. The woman with two unique colors opened her lips as she crossed her legs, exposing her thighs.\n“So, the bottom line is that you want us to join this war?”\n-Yes.\nThey were the 4 Guests.\nOfficially, the ‘4 Guests’ name was given to them by MS Group, but they were also called the Untouchables; they weren’t in a relationship where the MS Group could order them around, but rather in one based on each other’s conditions.\nIf they refused, MS Group would just wage war against Chun Yeowun and the Cult on its own.\n“It doesn’t look appealing to me.”\nThe woman said as if she wasn’t interested. It was the first refusal, and the middle-aged man in red hair shook his head right after.\n“I think you’re aware that this exceeds the terms of our agreement.”\nHe, too, refused. Coincidentally, the other two others spoke at the same time.\n“I’ll take care of that human.”\n“Let this old man handle it.”\nElder Cho and the hooded man sounded their confirmations. The two looked at each other with disgust, leaking their hate for each other.\n“That human possesses an item of our clan. This isn’t for you, human.”\n“No. If that person is the Chun Ma, I can’t yield in this matter.”\n“Is that so?”\nWoong!\nThe round table in the conference room was split in half at the tremendous energy emitted by two different people.\nAs the atmosphere filled with their intent to fight,\nC\ntried to intervene as\nA\ntook charge.\n-He is a person who can use spatial movement, so we can’t guess where he is headed. How about the one who finds him first handles him?\nThe two rivals looked at the screen. As\nA\nsaid, the person who found him first would get to handle him.\nBack in Shanghai.\n“Baekgi!”\n“Enough.”\nAt first, the two hugged each other because they were moved by the face they hadn’t seen for a long time, but not long after, Baekgi seemed to have had enough of it and told Hu Bong to stop.\n“You’re being too much. I haven’t seen you for so long, don’t blame me!”\nHu Bong didn’t hide his emotions as tears flowed from his eyes while looking at his friend.\n-Ugh, that red-haired guy. Tsk.\nLooking at Hu Bong, the golden fox clicked her tongue. However, the position where this dangerous fox was on was on the head of Bi Mak-heon.\n‘W-what?’\nBi Mak-heon knew about her identity, but he still felt strange. A weird energy manifested in the atmosphere.\n‘!?’\n“Move back everyone!”\nBaekgi shouted right away to everyone as Hu Bong, Mak-heon, Yu So-hwa and Im So-hye stepped back.\nWoong!\nThe space shook and a person appeared. It wasn’t just one person, but actually two people and a Ghost.\n“Lord!”\nHu Bong and Baekgi shouted at the same time. The two people were Chun Yeowun and\nH\n, who was wearing a white research coat.\n-Chun Ma!\nPhat!\n“Uk!”\nThe fox kicked Bi Mak-heon’s arms to jump into the arms of Chun Yeowun, who took away the fox rubbing its body on his and put it on his shoulder; the fox proceeded to say that it liked this place as well.\n“\nTsk\n.”\nChun Yeowun clicked his tongue, using the Sky Demon Sword to absorb the\nE\n’s Ghost into his wrist guard\n.\nHe was skeptical at first, but once\nE\nbecame a Ghost, Chun Yeowun now had the ability to move through space and could move other people at Chun Yeowun's will.\n‘What an effective means of transportation.’\nIt was his favourite achievement so far. Looking at\nH\n, Hu Bong asked,\n“Lord, who is he?”\n“Oh Hyun-gu, a new researcher in our cult.”\nH’\ns real name was Oh Hyun-gu. He, too, was a researcher who published his findings in major journals. Since he was abandoned by MS Group, he swore allegiance to Chun Yeowun and bowed.\n“I am Oh Hyun-gu, please take good care of me.”\nBaekgi frowned at the unfamiliar face and just nodded his head. He suddenly got on his knees and apologized to Chun Yeowun.\n“Lord. It was because I was incompetent that I couldn’t carry out the orders given by Lord, so please punish me.”\n“Punish? For what?”\nChun Yeowun was puzzled when Baekgi pointed somewhere. There was an object covered with a black cloth, and beneath the cloth was a corpse without arms or a neck.\n“This was the one on the ship.”\nThe owner of the body was Chae Mun-tak. Baekgi was looking for Ark Young, who suddenly disappeared, and found Chae Mun-tak on a speedboat. However, Chae Mun-tak shortly had a seizure right before his head exploded.\nH\n, or Oh Hyun-gu, heard that and thought,\n‘I would have turned like that too.’\nH\nhad only survived because his life was saved by Chun Yeowun. The nano explosions weren’t something Baekgi could prevent, so Chun Yeowun told him not to worry. However, even the executives could be removed by\nA\nthis easily and thoughtlessly, Chun Yeowun figured that there must be more secrets beyond what he knew so far.\n‘Annoying.’\n“However, my Lord…”\n“Hm?”\nHu Bong, who joined them later, was curious about what happened to Baekgi because he was acting weird. When Hu Bong asked, Baekgi told him not to worry so he just waited first, but he couldn’t wait any longer.\n“What happened—”\n“Lord Chun Ma, look at this.”\nBi Mak-heon suddenly intervened.\n“What?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s confusion, Bi Mak-heon showed him his phone screen. An unexpected message was written on the screen along the word, \"EMERGENCY\":\n[Raid by Blade Six]",

      "content": "Chapter 168: Blade God Six Martial Clan (1)\nThe site where Yonchun Group head office and buildings were gathered.\nA man in a mask was looking inside the Yongchun Group site with a telescope on a mountain about 2.6 km away.\nThe masked man was dressed in tight black clothes and a black sheath was on his back. A voice came from the wireless earphone in his ears.\n-Shanghai. Chun Mu-seong is moving to Hayden Hotel from the port.\nThe moment he heard those words, the masked man’s eyes were filled with joy.\nHe took off the mask he was wearing. The owner of the mask was none other than Blade Six’s Geum Seong-ryong, the current head of Blade God Six Martial clan.\n‘At last the time has come.’\nGeum Seong-ryong has been waiting for his moment.\nHe waited for Chun Yeowun, who was the main power, to leave his group.\n‘All because of him, the name we accumulated over time have collapsed.’\nTogether with the sects of the Murim Alliance, Blade Six was at the top of everything, until it went downhill because of an incident in the prison. The company’s sales were down, and the stock price hit rock bottom.\nHe was investigating the Black Sky Company, which was known to be the business of the Sky Demon Order.\n‘Huh! Do you think that I would fall so easly?’\nTaktaktak!\nGeum Seong-ryong said after tapping into the earphone three times.\n“Six Martial Masters.”\n“Yes!”\nSix voices could be heard.\nThe six executives of Blade Six. With the exception of their Vice-Chairman Oh Cheon-su, and General Director Seong Baek-chun, these people were the next best.\n“Are you ready?”\n“Finally!”\n“We waited so long.”\nThe six of them didn’t hide their excitement. They have been guarding this place for several days, heightening their determination to wage war. Geum Seong-ryong has the orders for the hungry wolves.\n“We move!”\n“Yes!”\nThere was a sound of something breaking.\nPak!\nWith that, the power supply 3 km away from Yonchun site was cut off, and darkness overtook.\nMeanwhile, in the Yonchun site, Chun Yu-jang, was going to his father Chun Woo-jin who managed to reach the desired state after the closed room training, and were having a light dinner.\n“It’s been so long since I’ve had dinner with my father like this, it reminds me of the past.”\nChun Yu-jang, who ate alone every day was full of smiles. It felt like he was reliving his childhood.\nChun Woo-jin had a bitter smile.\n“… I was lacking and I couldn’t look after you.”\n“Father…”\nActually, Chun Woo-jin felt more bad for Chun Yu-sang. No matter how bad he was, he was also his child. During his closed training the father thought that, if he didn’t fall into the trap of the enemies, he would be able to prevent the fight of the brothers.\n“It is absolutely not your fault, father. We are responsible for our own.”\nChun Yu-jang, who was weakened by the sight of his father with a bitter expression, tried to support him, which made Chun Woo-jin feel like his son had matured a lot.\n“Thank you for saying…”\nFlick!\nBefore he finished his sentence, the electricity went out. Chun Yu-jang was puzzled by the darkness.\n“Was there any information about electricity being cut off or repairs happening?”\n“No way. Our place is on contract with the City Central Electric Unit so it shouldn’t be cut 24 hours.”\nThe site couldn’t shut down at all since there’s a factory building inside Yongchun. It was because there were too many things that had to be constantly cooled.\nChun Yu-jang got up and picked up the phone connected to the kitchen.\n-….\n“Ah.”\nCome to think of it, the extension phone wouldn’t work because of electricity being cut off. Chun Yu-jang, who had a smartphone, dialed Huan Myung-oh.\n-Please move to an area where the call can be made since the area you're in is currently not able to direct the call.\nChun Yu-jang’s face hardened at it. If just the electricity had gone out, then he wouldn’t have thought much of it, thinking it was just a fault in the lines. However, cellular networks too?\n“Father!”\n“I heard it.”\nChak!\nChun Woo-jin picked up his sword that was next to the table and Chun Yu-jang opened the curtain to look outside the window. The entire side was covered in darkness.\nPak!\nIt was then, a part of the building was lit up. The reserve power was turned on and operating. Since it was for a factory, the other buildings weren’t considered a priority since consumption would be great.\n“Let’s head to the main office first.”\n“Yes.”\nThe two hurriedly grabbed their swords and headed out. Like their current building, many sites had their power cut off so people were gathering at the main office site.\nWhen they arrived in the lobby, they ran into the executives.\nThe executives looked at both the men.\n“Lord! Chairman!”\n“Huan Myun-oh, what is happening? Do you have any idea?”\nHuan Myun-oh then answered.\n“We have dispatched our men to check around and find out the situation. Rather, it would be better for us to be prepared first for an enemy attack.”\nThe other executives too agreed with it. At that, Chun Yu-jang gave the orders to the clan leaders.\n“The heads of each clan lead the members to defend the assigned area. Move now.”\n“Yes!”\nChun Yu-jang had led them for 17 years. With his skillful command, the people immediately moved.\nPhat!\nThree people appeared. It was the Great Guardian and the other two Guardians.\n“Lord! Chairman! We greet you.”\nThe Great Guardian Marayun, Left Guardian Lee Jong-hwa, and Right Guardian Seob-hyung stood around them in a triangle. Seeing that, Chun Yu-jang felt relieved. It had been so long since he had seen these three people in one place.\nIt wasn’t just them. Someone walked into the lobby with two gigantic swords on his back, he was Wang Shin.\nPak!\nHe knelt on one knee and said.\n“Lord. I will stay with you!”\n“Oh. Wang Shin.”\nAs one of the greatest powers of Sky Demon Order, him being here meant a lot. The current Yongchun Group wouldn’t fall behind in terms of power. Rather, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say it was stronger.\nAll because of one person. The strongest power who was absent now.\nShrek!\nThen someone appeared. A woman with red hair, she was Mun Ran-yeong.\n“Great Elder!”\nChun Yu-jang, the lord, greeted her with a bright face. Mun Ran-yeong was stronger than the Five Great Warriors of this time.\nFurthermore,\nShrek!\n“Human! Have you all gathered?”\n“Shakena!”\n“Ah! Sister. I was showering and then the hot water got cut off!\nShakena had her purple wet hair and frowned face. She was displeased but her appearance here was reassuring for others. As a demon she was stronger than Supreme Master levels.\nHuan Myung-oh approached Mun Ran-yeong and asked.\n“Has Lord Chun Ma been informed about this?”\nHe knew that even without a phone, Mun Ran-yeong could contact him. They had power to fight, but there was nothing wrong with letting Chun Yeowun know. Mun Ran-yeong shook her head.\n“I couldn’t contact him. Is there any other way to contact him?”\n“Ahh… I see.”\n“What is it?”\nHuan Myung-oh’s face darkened.\n“After all, they cut off the radio waves so I think it is jamming the nano chip inside you too.”\nThe waves of nano machines in Mun Ran-yeong needed a certain frequency to communicate, so if jammers were used, everything would be affected.\n“Then how?”\n“We sent out my men. I told them to send a warning signal to everyone.”\nMun Ran-yeong asked in a concerned voice.\n“Can they break through the siege around there?”\n“Huh?”\nEveryone was shocked. In fact, the person with the widest senses was Mun Ran-yeong. As a Divine Master level warrior, she sensed that a large number of people were narrowing the siege.\n“Close… for sure.”\nWhat they feared was real. Chun Yu-jang approached her and asked.\n“Great Elder. Could you use your senses to feel just how many there are?”\n“…. The number of people I can feel exceeds 1,200 people. Of course, all of them are good.”\n“This….”\nEveryone was flustered at it. If her words were sure the people coming in were 1,200 Master level warriors. There were many sects right now who had such power. However, since the Murim Association had fallen recently, and the Oshin recently went down, there weren’t many which had such power.\nNo. There was one.\n“No…”\n“Blade Six!”\nAmong the sects, only Blade Six had such a power. Huan Myung-oh bit his lip.\n‘How could I make such a mistake!’\nOn Chun Yeowun's orders, he had placed agents in Blade Six to monitor their movements. Not long ago, it was reported that Blade Six's chairman had gone missing. However, they had noticed that the enemy had surreptitiously relocated to Jinan City.\nPak!\nHuan Myung-oh got on his knees.\n“It was my mistake! Lord! I didn’t realize that they had moved over here and mobilized power.”\nActually, it was difficult to see it as his fault. There were forces of the Blade Six that had gone missing, and it was impossible to track them down individually. Furthermore, unlike Sky Demon Order, which has just recently begun to stand tall, Blade Six has continued to thrive.\nChun Woo-jin shook his head.\n“Director Huan Myung-oh. Now isn’t the time for this.”\nIf the enemies were sieging the place, then they had to be stopped. It would be no exaggeration to call this an all-out war between Sky Demon Order and the Blade God Six Martial clan.\n“It is dangerous.”\nChun Woo-jin said. Due to what happened in the prison, the enemies must have been enraged.\n“Ha, I have to tell this to Lord Chun Ma…”\nIf there was going to be an all-out war, then Chun Yeowun had to know of it.\nShakena said to Huan Myung-oh who was mumbling.\n“Can’t we call Master through a phone?”\n“Not possible. Because the entire area is being jammed.”\n“Then do it from outside.”\n“Right!”\nAt those words, Mun Ran-yeong had a good idea looking at Shakena’s hands.\n“Eh?”\nThere are numerous military people wearing masks and holding swords around the Yongchun site.\nThey even had the night goggles on, they were fully prepared for one purpose.\nIt was to capture all the members of the Sky Demon Order within the Yongchun site and kill them.\nFor each group, one of the Six Martial Masters was leading.\nAs soon as Geum Seong-ryong gave the orders, they moved over the fence.\n-Click!\nDid you enter?\n-Wait up.\n400 elite warriors of Blade God Six Martial clan were standing near the dark entrance of Yongchun Group.\n-\nClick!\nSomeone in a wheelchair appeared at that moment. An elderly man with dark blue hair, body markings, and aged skin. It wasn’t even an automatic wheelchair but the one moved with internal energy.\nPak!\nAt his appearance, all four hundred people and even the chairman bowed their heads.\n[I will lead directly from the front.]\nOriginally, they were supposed to advance right away, but they were waiting for this old man to come.\nThe chairman approached the old man and said,\n“Sir. We are ready. Just give us the orders.”\n“Yes!”\nLike his eyes, the elderly man's words appeared to flow with resolve. The old man, who had been motionless, slowly stood up.\nChairman Geum Seong-ryong tried to support him but was flatly refused.\n“I can walk alone.”\nCrack!\nThe old man straightened his back and relaxed his muscles then pulled out all the needles in his body.\nPak!\nThe old man mumbled in a young voice.\n“Today, you will love everything you treasure so much…”\n‘!?’\nWoong!\nBefore he could end it, the space shook.\nClang!\nGeum Seong-ryeong attempted to kick it after sensing a foreign energy. However…\nPak!\nThe person who emerged from the trembling space handled it lightly. Geum Seong-ryong couldn't comprehend how this individual handled things, even though it wasn't the greatest.\n‘He caught it?’\nHe looked at the one who caught his kick. Seeing the face, his eyes widened.\n“H-How did you get here?”\nIn his bewildered ears came the old man’s angry cry from behind.\n“Demon God!!!”\nWho suddenly appeared before them, was supposed to be in Shanghai.",

      "content": "Chapter 169: Blade God Six Martial Clan (2)\nSwoosh!\nAn unidentifiable form was traversing at an unfathomable speed as it turned opaque. The movement didn’t slow as it passed right through obstacles in front of it.\n‘Why am I being used like this?’\nIt was Shakena, flying low as her purple hair was fluttering. There was a smartphone in her hand, and although she couldn't use it because she didn’t know the programmed language, she knew which button to press.\n‘With Master’s pace, it won’t take too long.’\nShe predicted that Chun Yeowun would return while they were at war. The moment she pressed the button on the phone, she turned to return to the site.\n‘Master?’\nShe felt his presence as her gaze was directed to the site in front of the Yongchun Group.\n“Demon God!!!”\nThe old man’s blue eyes trembled. After many years had passed, people’s faces and land locations were blurred but the memories of Chun Yeowun’s face were clear in his head.\n“Ho-oh.”\nChun Yeowun was interested in that reaction. As soon as his face was seen, someone in the modern era called him Demon God, which most people in this time did not know about.\n“You know me?”\nWhen Chun Yeowun asked, the old man smiled with joy.\n“Yes, I know! How can I forget that abominable face?”\nHate was displayed with each word, gleaming with sincerity as well.\n“How long can you hold on for?”\nPal!\nGeum Seong-ryong infused his hand with Blade Energy and struck Chun Yeowun on his shoulder with great force.\nCrack!\nHe wasn’t able to cut Chun Yeowun’s shoulder; on the contrary, the Blade Energy couldn't dig into the shoulder and stopped with sparks.\n‘What kind of power is this?’\nWhen he was unable to make a scratch on his opponent, Geum Seong-ryong couldn't hide his embarrassment. Chun Yeowun then spoke to him as if he were disappointed,\n“If you were the current leader of Blade Six, you must be the Blade Lord, but it seems like you aren't as good as\nhim,\nthe one that Blade God set as his substitute.”\n“W-what?”\n“That means that there’s no place for you here.”\nPuck!\nAs soon as he said that, Chun Yeowun’s fist slammed into his chest, and the moment it made contact, the sound of bones being crushed resonated.\nCrack!\n“Kuaaak!”\nPapapak!\nMen wearing black masks held onto Geum Seong-ryong as he flew back, but they too were moved back because of the force.\n‘Stop! Stop!’\nGeum Seong-ryong tried to stop his motion, but he couldn’t stop the momentum and kept flying back. Then, he suddenly stopped.\nPak!\nSomeone caught him. Geum Seong-ryong raised his head, which was bleeding profusely by now,\n“Il-ryeong?”\nThe one who stopped his movement was an old man called Il-ryeong who seemed unable to move without his wheelchair.\n“T-thank–”\nPal!\n“Euk!”\nIl-ryeong threw the man who was thanking him to the ground. Il-ryeong looked down at him as if he was pathetic and said,\n“You are tarnishing the prestige of this clan.”\n“I apologize.”\nIt was difficult to speak with his crushed breastbone, and he didn’t raise his head in shame. He never fathomed their abilities to differ by this much. The old man named Il-ryeong looked at Chun Yeowun and said,\n“All of you aren’t strong enough to deal with the Demon God.”\nChun Yeowun’s eyes lit up at those words.\n‘His body moves well for his age.’\nIn Chun Yeowun’s eyes, the old man was severely aging, and moving was definitely hurting his body. However, his ability to swiftly like water was amazing seeing his age.\n“Who are you?”\nChun Yeowun was curious about him. The unique energy felt from this old man reminded him of someone.\n‘Blade God.’\nTheir energy had the same feeling, but Chun Yeowun was sure that he killed the man. This axis of time leading to the future all happened after Chun Yeowun had already killed Blade God.\n“I see that you don’t remember me.”\n“I’ve never met you.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, the old man laughed.\n“Kuahahahahaha!”\nEven the masked men who were at his side covered their ears to avoid the energy leaking out of his voice.\n“Kuak!”\n“I’m Il-ryeong!”\nThe old man was smiling as he looked at Chun Yeowun.\n“Well I haven’t seen you in over a thousand years, so it could be because those who live forever will forget others, but I will never forget you!”\nThe man’s form moved, appearing right before Chun Yeowun.\nSlash!\nThe old man’s hands were empty but he simply needed to use his Invisible Blade to attack. Chun Yeowun turned around and created an Invisible Sword to block the attack.\nClang!\nIl-ryeong was only using an invisible weapon made of internal energy, but when their weapons collided, a sharp sound rang out. What was more surprising was that the aftermath of the collision caused the land to crack and wind to blow everywhere.\n“Euk!”\n“Ack!”\nThe masked men were thrown to the floor from the strong winds. As the invisible weapons clashed, the old man said,\n“This will be different from the past.”\n“What?”\nHe spoke as if he had fought before, but Chun Yeowun had no memory of this old man.\n‘Haven’t seen me for a thousand years? Nano, do you have any idea who this man is?’\nHe asked just in case, since his mind wasn’t able to recall him. Since Nano was an AI and supercomputer, he thought it could find something at least.\n[Beginning the search.]\nChun Yeowun’s pupils trembled and the augmented reality activated. As the augmented reality showed an analysis of the old man’s face, he said,\n“Back then, I didn’t deal with you with my true power, but I’m not exaggerating when I say that now, a thousand years later, I’ve surpassed you!”\nCrack!\nThe old man’s forearm began to transform, and the transformation spread to the upper body parts as his clothes were torn, revealing his body to be full of muscles.\n“Huah!”\nChang!\nSurprisingly, the old man was able to deflect Chun Yeowun’s Invisible Sword. Chun Yeowun quickly changed the path of the sword and tried blocking the counterattack.\nKaaak! Kwang!\nChun Yeowun’s feet sank into the ground from the power of the Invisible Blade. The floor was dented in a 10 meter radius with cracks everywhere, and Chun Yeowun’s body dug into the floor until his waist. However, the old man’s attack wasn’t done yet.\n“Let me show you the true essence of the Blade God Six Martial clan!”\nThe blade swung towards Chun Yeowun unleashing the Seventh Form of the Blade of Eight Mountains.\nChachachacha!\nThe old man branched into eight afterimages, each with explosive power that all gathered for Chun Yeowun.\n‘Ha!’\nChun Yeowun was surprised. The technique that the man was performing was quite different from what he knew about the techniques of Blade God Six Martial clan, as they were much more advanced than those in the past.\n“Interesting.”\nChun Yeowun’s body, which was dug into the ground, rose up. While in that state, his Invisible Sword created displayed his splendid swordsmanship as the 24 Demon Swords were interlocked in a complex form.\n‘Sword God Waterfall Rain.’\nIt was the third form of the Sword Art of the Demon God, Sword God Waterfall Rain. In this era, for the first time Chun Yeowun unleashed the Sword Art of the Demon God, which was made by combining the Sword Force of the Sky Demon and the Extreme Art of the Blade God.\nChachachaca!\nTwo strong warriors collided and the people around moved back. The people of Blade Six, who had already retreated 50 meters outside, were shocked.\n“W-what kind of confrontation is this!”\nSlash!\n“Kuak!”\nOne masked man was cut in half because of the force. There were situations where arms and legs were also cut off by the force.\n“M-Move further back!”\n“Move!”\nThe confrontation wasn’t at a level that they could decide and watch. They all knew that death was in their footsteps if they wanted to watch this. However, came the voice of someone.\n[While this old man is dealing with him, you people take care of the remnants of the Demonic Cult.]\nIt was sent to not one, but all the people at the same time. And then all knew who sent it, Il-ryeong.\n‘Amazing. In the middle of a battle, he is guiding us.’\nThe masked men couldn’t help but be marveled at it.\n“Haa. Haaa… everyone heard it, right!”\nGeum Seong-ryong, who suffered from internal injuries, asked.\n“Yes!”\nExcept for the four who were there to guard him, the others tried to enter the site of the Yongchun Group.\nClash! Clash!\nAt that moment, countless Ice Swords appeared in the air.\n“T-this!”\nThey were surprised that Ice swords formed. Geum Seong-ryong who saw it mumbled.\n“That… Sky Flash!”\nHe heard everything he could from Il-ryeong about Chun Yeowun. The sight of being able to handle so many different techniques.\n‘A monster. He is doing this while dealing with Il-ryeong?’\nChun Yeowun was still in battle. But in the midst he reached out his hand and unfolded this one.\n“Sky Flash!”\nIl-ryeong too recognized it. There was strong anger in his eyes as he looked at it.\n“Who let you take your eyes off me?”\nChun Yeowun sarcastically asked the old man and then clenched his hand. At that moment, numerous Ice Swords came out.\nPapapang!\nIt was then. Il-ryeong had slashed his Invisible Blade to the floor.\nPush!\n“Huh!”\nAlong with a sound, a change occurred in the ground. As if the ground was going to explode, it suddenly shook and rose up.\nJkukuku!\nA lot of rocks came up, but that wasn’t all. A lightning bolt flashed from the rocks.\nPapapak!\nLike a shield, the Ice Swords were blocked. If it was normal rocks they would penetrate it and hit the targets, but the rocks had Thunder Qi around it.\n“H-he stopped it!”\n“Il-ryeong has stopped it!”\n“Woah!”\nThe masked men cheered for him.\nChun Yeowun’s eye lit up. It was the first time anyone had properly blocked his Sky Flash. And even more shocking was.\n“You… have taken the energy of all five spirits.”\nThe energy emanating from the old man's body could only come out by taking the energy of the Five Spirit Beasts. The combination of Earth Qi and Thunder Qi just before was also the same. The old man named Il-ryeong smiled as he said.\n“Did you think that for all these thousand years I was messing around? You aren’t the only one who can handle the energy of the Five Spirit Beasts.”\nPuck!\nFlames soared from the Invisible Blade. And the flames drew the trajectory aiming to kill Chun Yeowun. Everything the flaming Invisible Blade touched was burnt.\nChang!\nChun Yeowun, who was blocking it said,\n“Is that so? Then stop this.”\nPhat!\nChun Yeowun stretched out his hand.\nTickle!\n“\nPuat\n!”\nThe old man grabbed his chest and spit out blood as he bounced back. It was Chun Yeowun's Heart Sword that aimed at his heart. The Heart Sword, which unfolded with the determination to kill at once, seemed to have dealt a huge blow to the old man, and his body continued to be pushed away.\nTatatak!\nAnd at some point, the feet stopped. And the man bowed his head. Perhaps because of the pain lodged in him, he trembled as he held the chest and,\nJjjkkk!\nA sharp energy flowed out of the floor where the old man stood, causing cracks. Countless energies were raging around. And when Chun Yeowun saw it, he couldn’t help but feel amazed.\n“Did you take out… the Heart Sword?”\nThe energy flowing out from the feet of the old man was the Heart Sword’s energy. The old man, holding his head down and grabbing his chest, looked at Chun Yeowun with sharp glare.\n‘This!’\nChun Yeowun stretched out his hand. And the cracks in the floor right between the two made a pounding sound.\nClash!\nInvisible energy was flowing through the cracks. This phenomenon was unknown. It was because the will of the two collided. The old man lowered his hand from his chest and said,\n“Did you think that you alone were the Heavenly Master?”\nRight.\nWhat the old man tried to send through the ground was the Heart Blade. Not only did he absorb the energy of the Five Spirit Beasts but was also able to use the Heart Blade. It meant that he was the 6th Heavenly Master warrior in the history of Murim.\n“It has been a thousand years. With the sole intention of taking revenge on you, this man has studied everything about you.”\n“Studied about me?”\n“Whether it be unification of energy or Sky Flash, the Heart Sword and more. Try anything.”\nIt seemed crazy, but the words were nonsense.\nTang!\nThe old man pounded on his chest and shouted.\n“What do you think these wounds are? Traces of dealing with you with the images of the thousand years!”\n“Image?”\nFor many years, he thought about Chun Yeowun fighting him. The Demon God with greatest ability. He stood in front of the old man with his strongest form.\n“I know you are still hiding a couple things. Demon God.”\nThe old man looked at Chun Yeowun’s sword. He remembered it, the ferocious energy which was able to stop the energies of the spirits and even the regeneration of Blade God too.\n“Try to do everything. I will give you the worst despair that you will never forget.”\nWith those words, the old man pointed to the Yongchun Group. It wasn’t for Chun Yeowun, but the masked men who were watching them.\n‘He must concentrate.’\nIt was to distract Chun Yeowun. The opponent was a monster known to be the strongest since the history of Murim, so the old man decided to take him down by using all means and methods.\nWoong!\nAnother energy gathered in the old man's flaming Invisible Blade. It was the energy holding all five spirit energies.\n“The Five Elements… Blade?”\nThe five energies flowed brilliantly on the Invisible Blade. It was to prove that this old man was definitely a Heavenly Master.\nTatak!\nIn the meantime, the masked men moved and climbed over the rocks reaching for the Yongchun site. The old man took his stance.\n“Let’s see the end. There has to be only one Heavenly Master who survives today…”\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun raised his hand towards the sky, seeing that Il-ryeong clicked his tongue.\n“Foolish idiot. You should know that Sky Flash doesn't work…”\nCutting his words, Chun Yeowun said,\n“It seems like you made some great progress, but… you. But do you think that Heavenly Master is the end of martial arts?”\nCrack!\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun grabbed the empty space and tore it apart. A foreign energy rose in the air around.\nWooong!\nAnd the sky began to distort.\n‘This… what is this!?’\nThe old man gulped as he looked at the sky looking all bizarre. As the distorted sky turned turbid, a strong tornado struck. To the bewildered man, Chun Yeowun said.\n“Did you see this image of me when training?”",

      "content": "Chapter 170: Blade God Six Martial Clan (3)\n[ Editor - Angel says it’s war time!! Round 1000000x!! Fight!! ]\nChik!\n- Haa… Haa… Enter.\nIt was Geum Seong-ryong’s raspy voice commanding the Six Martial Warriors who were waiting for the instructions.\nThey couldn’t hide their curiosity.\n“Chairman… Blade Leader? By any chance…”\n- Hurry!\nThe order fell. If there was further delay, cutting off the energy and communication to this location would be pointless. Ridges impeded the path north to the Yongchun Group. Despite the fact that it was a natural fortress, the most efficient approach was to use it in darkness.\nOne of the Blade Six members ran and jumped from it.\nFlap!\nBoth of his hands were covered in materials that made it appear as if he had wings, allowing him to manipulate the direction and fly. The others leaped off after Yeon Mu-kyeon. Even if they were engulf in darkness, they were able to see inside using their night vision goggles.\n‘The defense formation’\nThe cost of delay in entering wasn’t too great. Members of the Yongchun Group were already stationed at each building, holding torches.\n“I will hit the front first. While the other Blade Master begins by cleaning up the north.”\nAll six of them were competing with each other. They thought that they could handle it easily because the Sky Demon Order had weakened compared to the past.\nHowever…\nWheik!\n‘!?’\nSuddenly, they were greeted by hundreds of flame spheres. Unfortunately, Chun Yeowun's best man, Hu Bong, was guarding the north. He was in charge of the most difficult place to protect.\n“How dare you aim for us?”\nPhat!\nWhen Hu Bong opened his hand, the flames burst and the fire spread in all directions.\nSwoosh!\n‘Damn it!’\nWoong!\nYeon Mu-kyeon jumped ahead and tried to block the flame, but it kept exploding. He managed to block it easily but that wasn’t the case for the others.\nWheik!\n“Kuak!”\nThe bodies of those who died in the flames were vigorously burned. The fabric between their arms and waist that was assisting them in flying was ripped, and as a result, they fell.\n“Shoot!”\nPapapak!\n“Kuak!”\n“Ack!”\nThe five clans defending the northern side of Yongchun were all the sects that handled long-distance weapons. They immediately moved with arrows loaded with energy and spears in their hands, targeting the intruders.\n“These bastards!”\nThe fallen masked men, believing they couldn't be beaten, countered the attack with spears and daggers. They basically believed that the weapons they threw had an effect on the cult members.\nPapapak!\n“Kuak!”\n“Use iron to block it!”\nOf course, they had a better defense than those who fell. What was interesting was that both sides of the war were proud of their non-explosive weapons. The same was true in the northeast and northwest, as well as to the east and west.\n“Woah!”\nChachacha!\nThe masked men and members of the cult collided.\nSince the First Dimension Gate opened, this was the longest war in murim.\n“Stop them! No one is allowed to enter!”\n“Yes!!!”\nUnder the command of the clan leaders, the members swung their weapons desperately to stop the masked men from entering.\n“Huah!”\nA tremendous force threatened the cult member’s safety each time the Strong Blade Master, one of the Six Martial Masters, wielded his blade.\n“Are there no strong ones other than these insects? Hahaha!”\nGu Cheong-sa, the Strong Blade Master, who mastered the techniques was robust. Hang Yu-rin was the one who was battling him and was wounded within just three seconds.\n“Kuak!”\n“You are pretty fine for a woman, but still a long way off from us.”\nGu Cheong-sa had cut her on the thighs and tried to slash her neck, but then a sword stopped it.\nClang!\n“Air Sword?”\nThe overconfident Gu Cheong-sa suddenly became tensed. A warrior with the ability to block his blade had appeared.\nA man wearing a unique patterned mask had appeared among the numerous warriors colliding with each other.\n“Wind God!”\nIt was the Great Guardian, Marayun. He had to protect the Lord but chose to ignore the command.\nMarayun raised his right hand up.\nSwosh!\nSix Air Swords appeared and surrounded him.\n“Handle this!”\nClang!\nOne of the swords that bounced back from the attack of Gu Cheong-sa had gone back to Marayun, who caught it.\nThe intimidation he was showing wasn’t common, and now he was handling seven Air Swords.\n“Kuakaka. The famous Wind God is here.”\nGu Cheong-sa, well aware of Marayun's fame, was both nervous and excited.\n“Anyone who enters the cult without permission will die.”\nGu Cheong-sa held his blade in both hands in front of Marayun.\nMarayun extended his sword. The seven swords rushed towards him like lightning at that moment.\nShhh!\nThe form of Gu Cheong-sa was divided into several parts and defended against the flying swords. The sound of seven swords clashing with something could be heard.\nChachachang!\nDue to the confrontation between such strong warriors, all those around them retreated. On the other hand, Wang Shin, the Dual Swords wielder, one of the strong warriors, was on the west side having a fierce battle. The battle was brutal, and both warriors wielded massive swords and blades that were much larger than normal weapons.\nWoong!\nEach time they collided with other people’s swords, their swords and blades would break down. No one could enter the 50-meter radius.\nThere was a person who was watching this from the rooftop of Yongchun Group.\n“There is no help needed.”\nShe was Shakena, with her purple hair fluttering. She wasn’t the only one there. There were Chun Woo-jin, Mun Ran-yeong, Yu So-hwa, and Im So-hye. They were all watching this scene.\n“Hmm.”\nChun Woo-jin, who was watching the battle happen, had a heavy expression on his face. The reason he couldn’t step out was because he was King here.\nHowever, the reason why the others didn’t step out was different.\n[Defense is played only with the power of the cult, excluding others.]\n[Huh?]\n[This is a battlefield for warriors only, not for people with special abilities or gate entities. Is there any reason why you should be involved in the cult’s affair?]\nWith those words from Chun Yeowun, they fell back.\nIn the north, Hu Bong participated in reducing the number of masked men since it was a geographical disadvantage.\n‘Right. The words of Ancestor are correct; we can’t always rely on others. This is a problem which the cult needs to overcome.’\nA crisis like this which the cult had to face. If Chun Yeowun kept solving things for them each time, the growth of the cult as a whole would fall.\nUntil now, no enemy has managed to break through the defense.\n‘We have made such progress.’\nChun Woo-jin looked at the southwest with a happy smile. There, Chun Yu-jang and a masked man were fighting. Chun Yu-jang, who recently learned more techniques from Chun Yeowun and refined his fighting style, was able to handle the intruders.\n‘The problem is… over there?’\nChun Woo-jin looked at the south gate. A huge event which couldn’t be compared with the other ones.\n‘… There is a reason why my ancestor wanted to go there.’\nChun Yeowun told them to handle this problem. But then suddenly he said he would handle the south gate. It made Chun Woo-jin puzzled but now he understood.\nKwakwakwang!\nAs he was looking at the south gate, he thought it was hard to believe that it was a battle between warriors. The entire area was devastated. It seemed like anyone who would approach them wouldn’t survive it.\n‘What is happening?’\nChun Woo-jin’s two eyes couldn’t see much because of the tornado. It wasn’t a whirlwind or tornado caused by nature.\nChachachacha!\nIn those winds, someone was wielding a weapon with five colors on it, and that was Il-ryeong.\n‘What the… What the hell! What is this?’\nThe old man was bewildered. Sharp energy was pressing against him as if the entire space had turned into swords, but his mind was elsewhere.\n‘I should keep on moving.’\nJust a little gap and the sharp energy would dig into his body. He felt the entire space was filled with swords.\n‘I need to get close to him.’\nHowever, he couldn’t move close to Chun Yeowun.\n“Ugh!”\nEven the five energies on the Invisible Blade didn’t seem to work as the entire space was just taking the energy away.\n“Kuaaaak!”\nThe old man screamed in anger as reality didn’t go his way. This wasn’t what he had imagined.\n“H-How could this…”\nGeum Seong-ryeong, who was on the ground with a pale face, couldn't understand what this tornado moving around was like. All he knew was that he didn’t want to be caught in it. There was no concept of being cut or stabbed. If one was swept away, he would be reduced to ashes.\n“Il-ryeong!”\nEven Il-ryeong, who was trapped in there, couldn’t help but try to protect himself.\n“B-Blade Leader! H-Humans can’t do that!”\nEven the men protecting him were stunned at this. A little closer and they would have been caught up by the winds. Perhaps now was their chance to move to a safe place.\n‘Should I… escape?’\nShhhh!\nAs he was thinking that, the space, which was twisted, was back to its original state. The fierce energy subsided.\n‘It stopped?’\nAs the winds stopped, the old man tried to catch his breath.\n“Haa… Haa… ”\nChun Yeowun went close to him, to which the old man opened his mouth.\n“Haa… Haa.. Why… why did you… stop?”\nHe felt anger at the thought of Chun Yeowun sympathizing with him.\nChun Yeowun answered.\n“It is a waste to turn a guy like you to ashes.”\n“What?”\nThe old man was shocked. Just listening to it felt like he was acknowledged as his rival.\n‘This one…’\nWhen the man with the strongest ability to kill anyone said that, his anger subsided a little.\nHe then regained his composure and asked,\n“… What did you just unfold now?”\n“Hmm.”\nChun yeowun stroked his chin. There was nothing to say. It was something he obtained when he realized the truth about space and the universe.\n“Well… If I had to give it a name then it would be Space Sword.”\n“Space Sword!”\nSpace Sword. The old man bit his lip at the fitting name. This was a very thrilling technique, using the entire space as their own and using it like a sword.\n‘… If I had exhausted all my stamina, I would have died.’\nThe result of the match was already decided. There was no way he could defeat Chun Yeowun. The joy of countless victories he had imagined during his practice was in vain.\nKwang!\nCracks rose on the ground as the old man was filled with fury. He thought that he would be able to avenge his master by ascending to the Heavenly Master level. All of that turned into a lie.\nHe looked at the night sky.\n‘Is it like the sky above the sky?’\nHe wasn’t sure if Chun Yeowun’s sky was above their sky, but this reality seemed to make it sound true.\nHe lowered his head and asked Chun Yeowun in a voice full of frustration.\n“Demon God…. What kind of state have you reached?”",

      "content": "Chapter 171: Blade God Six Martial Clan (4)\nChun Yeowun stroked his chin at the question. He had gained an understanding of the universe and the space beyond Mother Nature, but he didn’t think that he had reached any state in particular. Fully realizing the universe was no different from having an understanding of all things.\n“Hmm, well…”\nThe old man said to Chun Yeowun,\n“There is a saying that when you reach higher and go beyond nature, realizing the void above, one will break free. It seems that you have reached the Void Master level.”\nKnowledge of the universe came from the Mansa Sutras along with the ancient books, such as one written by a past scholar named Horo during the period of the Three Emperors and Five Monarchs that described the nature of everything.\n“Void...?”\nThe word void meant emptiness, and Chun Yeowun, who realized some of the truth of the universe, thought the word was apt with his current level of understanding.\n“Void Master… sounds good.”\nEven though the name was given by the old man who was his enemy, it was definitely the most appropriate one. The old man told him that if he were to clearly understand the entire universe and freely handle everything in the future, the state of ‘wisdom’ would be appropriate.\n‘No way He’s beyond the Heavenly Master level?!’\nGeum Seong-ryong, who was right there watching the scene unfold, was shocked. Just reaching the legendary Heavenly Master level was rare within the entire history of Murim, but the crossing of that stage had just been recognized.\n‘How can this be?’\nGeum Seong-ryong was flustered at the realization. Looking at the old man, he saw that he had no will to fight.\n‘Now matter how much we fight, if the opponent is that strong, then…’\nTheir efforts would be meaningless because of the clear difference between their skills. The old man said,\n“Why… why didn’t you use the sword that you used against\nhim\n?”\nHe didn’t understand Chun Yeowun’s decision; From the sheer difference in ability, he might have been able to subdue the old man with that ferocious sword rather than the Space Sword.\nChun Yeowun smiled and said,\n“You’re not immortal so there’s no need to use it.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, the old man’s wrinkles deepened.\n“I see… you’ve realized it.”\n“How could I not? If you had taken the spiritual power of the Five Spirit Beasts, you would be fully immortal; your failure to stop aging proves this.”\nChun Yeowun absorbed all the cores of Five Spirit Beasts to achieve immortality, meaning that he would never grow old or die. However, although the old man did indeed have the energy of the Five Spirit Beasts, he still showed signs of aging. The reason was simple: he wasn’t immortal.\n“Yes, you’re right. I took their blood and not the cores.”\nThe Five Spirit Beasts had both blood and cores, and those who drank the blood would gain great power and regeneration.\n“However, I didn’t take in the energy right away and couldn’t help gaining age.”\nNevertheless, thanks to the blood, he was able to live for quite a long time. Chun Yeowun clicked his tongue.\n‘So this is what you’ve been through.’\nNo matter how much blood was taken, a thousand years was still a long time to live. The energy in the blood must have lost its potency as years passed.\nChun Yeowun’s three subordinates had also taken the blood, but since they had hibernated in the ice like Hu Bong, the effects of the blood couldn’t be guaranteed. Chun Yeowun asked,\n“Couldn’t you have just taken the core?”\nTo that, the old man responded,\n“I was told you had been hiding for a long time, but I guess you also don’t know of the worldly affairs, Demon God.”\n“What?”\n“The Spirit Beasts disappeared long ago.”\n“The Spirit Beasts….disappeared?”\nThis shocked Chun Yeowun; since Black Athena had the blood of Imoogi, he thought the Spirit Beasts still existed.\n“I tried to save them”\nThe power in the blood wasn’t enough to survive, so the old man sought out the Spirit Beasts.\n“There were too many enemies, thanks to you.”\nFor the past several hundred years, even reforming the clan was difficult because the alliance of the Sky Demon Order with the Imperial family and the Forces of Justice led to all of these forces trying to kill anyone affiliated with the Blade God Six Martial clan.\nHe had to take a lot of time to form the clan again.\n“Spirit Beasts are beings born with the energy of Mother Nature. Did something happen to this world?”\n“Yes.”\nAt some point, the number of humans increased and the population kept growing, detrimentally affecting the natural environment. Destruction of forests, depletion of natural resources, and the rapid air pollution leading to the destruction of the ozone layer dispersed the pure and clean energy of nature.\n‘So that’s the reason.’\nChun Yeowun had vaguely guessed this from the modern information he obtained from Nano, but he hadn’t thought about the effects on the birth of Spirit Beasts.\n‘But…’\nIf he thought about it, it was strange that people of this age didn’t know about the Spirit Beasts, showing that they were beings of the past. He now understood why there weren’t any mentions of the Spirit Beasts on the internet at all.\n“This was futile.”\nThe old man approached Chun Yeowun with a disappointed face and poitned to his own neck.\n“I can never reach your state. Kill me.”\nChun Yeowun’s eyes lit up when the man admitted his defeat and asked for death. Despite having hatred for a thousand years, it was weird how he gave in so easily.\n“You gave up too quickly.”\n“It’s to prevent bloodshed.”\n“Bloodshed?”\n“It seems like your men are stronger than I thought; I assumed I would only have to deal with you.”\nIl-ryeong had reached the Heavenly Master level, so he felt the energy around him, allowing him to sense that not a single one of the Six Martial Masters had entered the site.\n“I beg you to spare their lives.”\n“Il-ryeong! Hmph!”\nAt those words, Geum Seong-ryong yelled. He never dreamed that the old man would sacrifice himself for others.\n“You think I will spare them?”\nChun Yeowun asked in a cold voice. He never spared people. The first time he ever did so was when he had stopped the Space Sword to stop the old man’s body from turning into ashes.\n“I know all about you, Demon God.”\n“You keep talking as if you know me very well. Who are you?”\nHe asked Nano to search, but he couldn’t find a name for the man.\n“Kulkul, it seems like you’re still not perfect. I am Hwang-heol. Once, long ago, I dealt with you and managed to escape because of my leader’s words.”\n“Hwang… heol?”\nIt was a name he didn’t remember. Il-ryeong frowned at Chun Yeowun, who tilted his head.\n“It seems you can’t even remember my name.”\n“I remember every person I’ve dealt with.”\n“Do you remember the one with bandages all over who stayed by the Blade God until the end?”\nChun Yeowun’s eyes fluttered. That was all he needed, how could he not remember that man?! The man in bandages protected the Blade God by the side until the very end.\n“You… were dead.”\nIn Chun Yeowun’s memory, the man had died when his heart was pierced by Sky Flash.\n“I didn’t die. I was barely holding my breath.”\nThe old man, Il-ryeong–no, Hwang-heol–was on the verge of death until someone came and gave him the blood of a Spirit Beast.\n“At the moment before death I took the blood of a spirit beast.”\n“Ah.”\nThose who took the blood of a Spirit Beast were known to have extraordinary regeneration. Chun Yeowun didn’t notice it because Hwang-heol’s body was covered with bandages that blocked Chun Yeowun from sensing his energy fluctuations. If Chun Yeowun had noticed it, he would have burned him right then. Then, Chun Yeowun remembered something.\n“… Then, there might be others with spirit energy.”\nIf he thought about it, even Blade God had the cores of the Spirit Beasts and was immortal. Naturally, he would have given the blood to his men. At Chun Yeowun’s question, Hwang-heol had a bitter expression.\n“I… am the last.”\n“How can I believe that?”\nThey could be hidden, waiting for the right moment. Of course, he could find them if he read the man’s memories.\n“There are a total of four people whom he endowed with spirit energy.\"\n“Four people?”\n“Huh! You killed one of them, Gulwon with your own hands. You don’t remember?”\n“Gulwon?”\n“Ha…”\nHwang-heol sighed. At the time, it wasn’t just one or two that Chun Yeowun had killed: the number was over a thousand people.\n“He had the spirit of the Flame Qilin.”\n“Ahh.”\nHearing that, Chun Yeowun nodded his head. As soon as he reached the state of Heavenly Master, the first person he killed was a red-haired man with flames.\n‘That has to be him.’\nNow, there were still three others. Hwang-heol bit his lip.\n“Fate is something we’ll never figure out. We were only holding onto this tough life to get revenge on you when you disappeared.”\nThere wasn’t any anger directed at Chun Yeowun, so Chun Yeowun asked,\n“Are you really the only one alive?”\n“Even though we aren’t on good terms, it has been over a thousand years. When I said I would give up my life, why would I have to deceive you?”\nHwang-heol looked sad, and by looking into his eyes, Chun Yeowun knew that the man wasn’t lying. Hwang-heol man spoke again,\n“I am the last. Please end my life.”\nChun Yeowun stroked his chin. This was the first time since becoming enemies in the past that such a person was being nice.\n“You’re a funny one.”\nChun Yeowun rolled up his right sleeve and held out his hand.\nChachacha!\nThe wrist guard changed to Sky Demon Sword.\n“Sky Demon Sword!”\nHwang-heol recalled it from the past: the sword he hadn’t seen for a long time. The enemy he wanted to kill for so long was sharpening his sword to kill him, but seeing the sword actually made him happy.\n“It’s like we were friends on bad terms, hehe.”\nHwang-heol accepted everything, to which Chun Yeowun said,\n“It would be disgraceful if I put my hands on you with your subordinates here.”\n“Thanks for that, bad friend.”\nHwang-heol called Chun Yeowun a bad friend, and considering how they were now, it did seem like an accurate description. It was refreshing, in a way.\n“Don’t expect things to go your way.”\nChun Yeowun raised his sword and the Ghost Qi rose.\nShhhh!\nA gloomy energy emanated from the sword, making Hwang-heol gulp as feeling death closed in.\n“As long as I die, there will be nothing for you to worry about. Of course, those who respect me might hate you a bit.”\nChun Yeowun mumbled to it.\n“Want me to kill you or not?”\nHwang-heol closed his eyes, pushing his neck forward and said,\n“Do it. Kill me.”\nChun Yeowun sighed, seeing the man so desperate.\n“You really are a funny one. One last question before I kill you.”\n“What do you want?”\n“The four people with spirit energy you mentioned should be strong, right? How did they die? Did they die at the hands of my descendants?”\nChun Yeowun was curious about the others, to which Hwang-heol spoke in anger,\n“No. They were killed by one force.”\n“A force?”\n“They pretend to be gone now, but they still exist I’m telling you!”\nCrack!\nChun Yeowun felt that Hwang-heol was more angry at this force than at him and asked,\n“Was that force the MS Group?”\n‘!?’\nHwang-heol was shocked.\n“How do you know?”",

      "content": "Chapter 172: Bad Friend (1)\n[Editor - Angel has dropped some of her tears.]\n“H-how did you know?”\nThe shocked Hwang-heol asked. To say that he guessed the name with a few words was strange that the guess was correct.\n‘Again?’\nChun Yeowun thought about the involvement of MS Group. Unknown to them, there was no place that MS Group didn’t touch, from politics to Gate Keepers to Murim. It was surprising that even this clan, which was horrible to control, was destroyed.\n“How did you get involved with them?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s question, Hwang-heol recalled the past. About 350 years ago, it was the time when Blade God Six Martial clan, who hadn’t been able to establish itself in Murim, was slowly trying to rebuild itself.\n‘350 years back?’\nChun Yeowun was puzzled by the story. He had no idea that MS Group existed since then.\n“The three of us, who were still alive as a result of the Spirit Beasts' blood, were looking for a way.”\nPeople hadn't seen the Spirit Beasts again. It took a lot of manpower and time to find them. Then came word that an Imoogi had been discovered on Mount Oji.\n“It was the last Spirit Beast in this world. So we moved directly to catch it.”\nImoogi was the leader of all the Spirit Beasts, and the Earth Dragon was stronger than the others. So the three of them went out to hunt it.\n“We fought the Imoogi for half a day.”\nThe three of them were strong because of their long lives. Even though they had to work together to defeat the Imoogi, an unexpected thing happened while they were reviving their youthful bodies.\n“Those people suddenly showed up.”\nIt had to be around the time they were all physically exhausted. An ominous energy emanated from a man wearing a silver mask and a man with red brows.\n‘Red eyebrows.’\nChun Yeowun was reminded of someone when he heard the phrase \"red eyebrows.\" However, he soon became more interested in the ominous evil energy.\n‘Was it him?’\nThe Heavenly Killing Star called Cho Yushin?\nHwang-heol continued to talk.\n“We were wary as they suddenly appeared.”\nHwang-heol and the other two didn't notice the people until they appeared. And they were well aware that these were not ordinary people.\nThen the one in the silver hair suggested,\n[I've been keeping an eye on you for a long time. If you join us, we will be able to stand as the strongest rather than a heretic in Murim.]\nThey couldn’t pass on the suggestion. It could have been different at any other time, but they were exhausted in the battle with Imoogi and thought that it wasn’t a good idea.\n[If you want to hold hands, shouldn’t you at least reveal your identity?]\nAs a response to Hwang-heol’s question, the man with silver hair said,\n[Right. I believe I misunderstood something. We are part of the Mu-seong group.]\n“Wait.”\nChun Yeowun interrupted Hwang-heol’s story.\nHwang-heol was perplexed as to why this man said that, which prompted Chun Yeowun to pause for a moment and think…\n‘A coincidence?’\nChun Yeowun was quite shocked at the answer which came out froom Hwang-heol from his question.\n“And that group was MS Group?”\n“… It is.”\nChun Yeowun’s face hardened. There was a time he was worried what this MS meant, but there was no record of it on the internet.\n‘No way.’\nMu-seong was Chun Yeowun’s fake name. It was also the name of his descendant who had given him the Nano Machine.\n‘Has to be a coincidence… right?’\nHe wondered if he was simply overreacting. Names could always overlap. The name Mu-seong couldn’t have belonged to one or two people in the entirety of China, and it wasn’t weird for companies to make up names either.\nAccording to his subordinates who were stuck in ice, the descendant was going around with the name of Seong Mu-chun as a seer.\n‘Must be a coincidence.’\nNo matter how he thought, there was no way Chun Mu-seong would create such an organization. There was no connection at all.\nHwang-heol, who noticed the seriousness, asked.\n“Is there something wrong, Demon God?”\n“… No, continue.”\nIt was suspicious but Hwang-heol continued.\n“We were exhausted and not in perfect condition, so we ended up listening to them.”\nTheir condition, however, was that they give them the Imoogi's core and corpse. In other words, they desired the entire beast. It was impossible for Hwang-heol and the other two to give up on preventing the aging process.\n“In the end, we fought them.”\n“Must have been tight. And all three of you?”\n“No.”\n“Hm?”\n“There was one who left.”\nHwang-heol spoke while trembling. The old man who didn’t hide that evil energy had said.\n[Blade God Six Martial clan. Huhuhu. I've finally met you. It's unfortunate that you're like this, but I'm hoping you'll be able to satisfy me.]\nAn old man who uttered words they didn’t understand. As soon as the man was done speaking, he extended his arms towards them.\nWith trembling eyes, Hwang-heol said,\n“I have met the Demon God and many more monsters in my life, but never a monster like him.”\nDespite their exhaustion, the three of them worked hard. Of course, Hwang-heol hadn't yet reached the Heavenly Master level at the time, but he never imagined such a crushing defeat in just a few seconds.\n“If Ma Hu-yeon and the other hadn’t tried to stop them, I wouldn’t have been able to get out of there…”\nHwang-heol’s eyes turned red at the mention of Ma Hu-yeon. His face was full of anger and sadness.\nHwang-heol, the last of them, tried to escape from there.\n“I never dreamt that I would run away again in my life after the fight with you, Demon God.”\nHwang-heol, who barely escaped with serious injuries, soon went to the base of the clan and then spread rumors that all of his companions and himself were dead.\n“In the beginning, they sent out a lot of spies to find out if I was alive or dead.”\nHwang-heol had to hide himself like a dead mouse. At least until they disappeared, he thought that he should increase his strength. Contrary to his wishes, those people had invaded China a long time back and exerted influence in politics, the economy, and Murim.\n“I had to change course in order to survive.”\nHe wouldn't survive, judging that they were called \"bad clan,\" so he tried to change.\n“At that time, we put on the pretense of being good and pushed into the Murim.”\nFrom then, they were members of the association.\nChun Yeowun nodded his head.\n‘So that was what happened.’\nIt was only then did he come to know why the Murim Association let them be in. The Murim Association was like the Forces of Justice which hated the Blade God Six Martial clan.\n“I heard news that the group had suddenly disbanded 15 years back.”\nThe reason was unknown. It seemed like something big had happened to the MS Group. And the Blade Six didn’t want to miss the chance.\n“Since then, we have been tracing them! We traced and pursued their whereabouts, seeking our revenge.”\nHis voice trembled as he emphasized it.\nIt was even more intense than his anger for Chun Yeowun in the beginning.\nChun Yeowun asked,\n“If you don’t want to, you don’t have to answer… Is it because of Ma Hu-yeon?”\nAs Chun Yeowun asked, Hwang-heol expressed sadness.\nIt wasn’t certain but he thought that the name belonged to a woman, and that this man had a deep relationship with her.\n‘Revenge.’\nWhether it was love or companionship, Hwang-heol’s sorrow for losing someone important had to be filled with revenge.\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun asked another thing.\n“Wait… You have been tracking the MS Group for 15 years?”\nIf it was the Blade Six, these bunch were famous for spies and having information no one had. So Hwang-heol yelled at Chun Yeowun at that.\n“Demon God, you came in and ruined it at the crucial moment!”\n“What?”\nChun Yeowun was taken aback at the accusation.\n“What is that supposed to mean?”\n“I found after a long search that they were outside the gate barrier and not inside.”\n“Okay.”\nIt was more information that Chun Yeowun knew. The result of tracking on a group for 15 years.\n“However, thanks to the prison scenario that broke out, we turned out to be targets even in the eyes of the government and Murim!”\nThey were all put under surveillance as a result of Chun Yeowun's fabrication. Unexpected events occurred. Furthermore, Chun Yeowun entered into an exclusive agreement with the Ministry of National Defense, which meant that no organization other than the Yongchun Group was allowed to leave the gates.\n“… So you came here?”\n“\nKkum!\n”\nAt the question, Hwang-heol coughed.\nBlade Six had no choice but to risk their lives in this war with the Yongchun Group. It wasn’t just to avenge some thousand year back revenge.\n“Things just fell in like that, Demon God.”\n“You are a funny one.”\nChun Yeowun clicked his tongue, looking at the man. If he had considered Chun Yeowun his enemy, he would have killed the man despite his body being weak. But in the end, the old man himself had given up, knowing he couldn’t do much.\n“Still… It is unfortunate.”\nHwang-heol looked at the night sky. It was the first time he had said what had happened to anyone. The pillar of the current Blade God Six Martial clan.\nHe couldn’t show weaknesses like this, but he felt more at ease after speaking.\n“\nPhew.\n”\nHwang-heol, who eased his heart, opened his eyes and asked.\n“I have a request to ask from the Demon God. If you too, have something against the MS Group…”\n“Against?”\nCrack!\nHwang-heol clenched his teeth.\n“Erase them from this world!”\nWith that, he stuck out his neck.\nThere was no more hesitating as he said everything he needed to say. It felt unjust that he couldn't exact his vengeance, but this seemed fine.\nChun Yeowun then said to him,\n“Well, fine. That request… let this bad friend do it.”\n‘!!!’\nA smile crept on Hwang-heol’s lips at those words. It felt like his loneliness, pain and emptiness had been filled after a long time.\n“Thank you.”\nHwang-heol felt at ease. The sound of Chun Yeowun raising his sword was heard.\n‘Hu-yeon. Your revenge is left to the monster who can get it. We haven’t seen each other in these long years, so don't criticize me when I see you.’\nSlash! Tak!\nThe cold blade stopped on his neck. Hwang-heol opened his eyes.\n“What are you doing?”\nTo which Chun Yeowun answered,\n“It is a waste to kill you.”\n“What?”\nChachacha!\nThe Sky Demon Sword turned into a wrist guard again, which resulted in Hwang-heol raising his head in anger.\n“Are you sympathizing with me?!”\nHe didn’t want sympathy from anyone.\nChun Yeowun answered,\n“No. This is not sympathy. I am just trying to use you.”\n“Use me?”\nChun Yeowun smiled.\n“The enemy of my enemy is my friend.”",

      "content": "Chapter 173: Bad Friend (2)\nPuah! Puah!\nFireworks soared into the sky as yellow fireworks decorated the night sky. Seeing the night lit up, the Six Martial Masters couldn’t hide their doubts.\n‘Stop the war?’\nThe yellow firecrackers meant\nstop\n, red meant\nretreat\n, and blue meant\ngather\n. The battle hadn’t even started for long, and they hadn’t even stepped into the site yet, but they were asked to stop.\nBack at the north of Yongchun site:\n“Blade Master! What do we do?”\nYeon Mu-kyeon was perplexed by the questions, and his poor physical conditions didn’t help.\nChachang!\nHe looked at two people who were constantly clashing with their weapons. He arrived with another Blade Master, trying to take down the red-haired man his partner was fighting.\n‘We haven’t even subdued this monster yet.’\nThe monster they were dealing with was Hu Bong, and while they were struggling to break through this one enemy, then the signal to stop was sent into the night sky.\n“Is that your signal? Hehe.”\nChachang!\nHu Bong excitedly spread out his sword as he asked the Blade Master he was fighting against, but neither of his opponents answered.\n‘Bastard!’\nThey didn’t answer him because they couldn't afford to let their concentration on him waver.\n‘What should we do?’\nThey couldn’t figure out their next step and Yeon Mu-kyeon, who had fallen down from just one kick, couldn't understand if it really was a signal to end the fighting or if the signal came from the enemy tricking them. It was then:\nTatatak!\n“Senior! Stop fighting!”\nAt that instant, someone who Hu Bong assumed to be one of the cult members sent him the message through telepathy. Hu Bong widened the distance between himself and the Blade Masters to ask,\n“What? Stop the fight?”\nBlade Six wasn’t the only one who gave the order to stop, as signals to stop the war came from both sides.\nPang!\nAnother firework lit up the sky, and this time it was the blue signal for gathering.\nThe members of Yongchun Group and Blade Six, who were fighting for their lives 30 minutes prior, were able to gather while facing one another.\nIn the midst of the war, the Yongchun Group executives and the Blade Six executives had gathered. Without knowing what was happening everyone gathered under the call of Chun Yeowun and Hwang-heol, who were the heads on both sides.\n[Blade Lord, why did we stop?!]\nButchery Blade Master Yang Mun asked, still glancing at Wang Shin. The wounds on their bodies showed the ferocity of the battle between the two warriors.\n[…]\nGeum Seong-ryong had nothing to say. Although he was the chairman of Blade Six and the Blade Lord, he couldn’t disregard the old man because Il-ryeong was his ancestor.\nOn the other hand, Gu Cheong-sa was looking at Chun Yeowun and not Marayun, who he had been fighting.\n‘This is the one Il-ryeong spoke off.’\nChun Yeowun defeated the one called Blade God, so there wasn’t anyone in Blade Six who wouldn’t be angry with him.\n‘Is he that strong?’\nThe aura they were feeling was ordinary. Of course, those who were stronger could mask their presence, but the Blade Six warriors were all curious.\n‘I want to fight him. I want to test his strength.’\nYong Dal-chung, one of the Blade Six Martial Masters, sighed.\n‘It’s starting again.’\nGu Cheong-sa was one of the most interested in martial arts, known for his strength because of his will to learn from those who were stronger. He had even fought with Il-ryeong before, though he was beaten to death.\n[Hey. That monster will not spare you like Il-ryeong.]\nOne of the Blade Masters warned him just in case. He knew that thousands of people of his clan had died in the hands of Demon God, and any curiosity would cost their lives.\n‘You want me to miss this chance?’\nGu Cheong-sa licked his lips. As a Murim warrior, the strongest-known existence was right in front of him, stimulating his urges like a gourmet dish made by the best chef.\n‘I just need a cause.’\nThe current situation was a ceasefire that stopped the war. Geum Seong-ryong pretended to be fine, but his legs were trembling as he suffered from internal injuries. Moreover, it was evident that Il-ryeong hadn’t been able to defeat the Demon God.\n‘I’m sure I’ll get a chance.’\nHwang-heol stepped ahead and opened his mouth,\n“As a representative of Blade Six… no, as Hwang-heol, one of the Spirit Blood users, I will inform you of the reason for bringing you all here.”\nHe was speaking normally, but his voice was heard by everyone. Unlike the members of the Yongchun Group who were puzzled, those of Blade Six were anxious. They had predicted this outcome to some extent but all hoped that the declaration of anything but victory wouldn’t come from Hwang-heol’s mouth.\n“There has been a long-standing grudge between us and the Sky Demon Order for a thousand year, but it is now time to change that.”\n‘What?’\n‘What’s he saying?’\nBoth sides were looking at Hwang-heol with their utmost concentration.\n“Unfortunately, both us and the Sky Demon Order share a common enemy: MS Group.”\nWhisper!\nA change occurred in the eyes of Blade Six members, recognizing their worst enemy as MS Group.\nAfter the collapse of Black Sky Company 17 years ago, they were no longer obsessed with the Sky Demon Order. However, their situation with MS Group was different because they were constantly at war with one another.\n“After a long conversation with Chun Ma, we figured out that the MS Group has been setting us up to wage a meaningless war between us.\"\nHwang-heol paused and looked around as he said,\n“Are you going to turn our heads at this trickery?”\nAt Hwang-heol’s word’s the Blade Six members shouted.\n“We can’t stand by!”\nThe voice of people resounded. Hwang-heol was adept at commanding people and the Blade Six’s suspicious stance transformed into a self-righteous stance in an instant. When the desired atmosphere was formed, Hwang-heol said,\n“I declare it: starting today, I will form an alliance with the Sky Demon Order to end this meaningless battle and face the true enemy!”\n“Wahhh!!!”\nWhen Hwang-heol finished speaking, all of the members of Blade Six shouted. From their point of view, the word alliance was a lot better than surrender, which they had all been fearing. Hwang-heol looked at Chun Yeowun and coughed, causing Chun Yeowun to smile.\n‘He’s quite proud of himself.’\nOriginally, Chun Yeowun suggested the man join him, but Hwang-heol refused the offer right away.\n[… Kuh, I can’t do that.]\nHwang-heol promised that anything other than integration could be possible. However, he said that he would never enter another clan or risk his clan’s members, displaying a final bit of pride in front of his rival of a thousand years.\n[Thanks to my whim!]\nHwang-heol looked at Chun Yeowun and remembered the request he had asked for on a whim. He was skeptical that Chun Yeowun would even listen to the request in the first place, as Chun Yeowun could have easily annihilated all the Blade Six members if he wanted to.\n‘Thanks for the kindness, Demon God.’\nThanks to Chun Yeowun’s mercy, he was able to save face. Chun Yeowun, however, was looking at the situation with a different attitude as if seeing a different scene when he felt that something was awry.\nSomeone shouted in the warm atmosphere,\n“I can’t understand this!”\nAt the cry, everyone turned to the voice that came from Strong Blade Master Gu Cheong-sa.\n‘Sigh.’\nThe other Six Martial Masters sighed, knowing that he was up to no good.\n‘That bastard’s idiotic attitude!’\nYong Dal-chung, the Jade Blade Master, had looked to the side and shouted out loudly when their ancestor had declared an alliance, but now turned his attention to Gu Cheong-sa.\n[Stop it! Have you lost it?]\nYong Dal-chung sent him a message.\nSlang!\nHowever, the man only pulled out his blade and pointed it at Chun Yeowun.\n“The Blade God who is your lord will weep in the underworld. His blood is on this man’s hands, how can we make an alliance so easily?”\nAt that, the other people mumbled too. Clearly what he said was true. If such a word was used, no one would blame this man for acting out.\n‘This bastard!’\nHwang-heol stared at Gu Cheong-sa in anger. In the past, he had cheekily asked Hwang-heol for battles several times, each time being let off the hook because he was a member of the clan. However, this was a drastically different situation.\n“How dare you aim your blade at him!’\nKwang!\nHu Bong stepped forward in anger, causing the floor to crack from the intense energy he was releasing.In fact, all of the members of the Sky Demon Order were full of rage and murderous intent. At that moment, Chun Yeowun stopped them and said,\n“He seems pretty daring. Right, I do have the blood of your ancestor on my hands, so what?”\nHearing Chun Yeowun’s words, Gu Cheong-sa smiled. This was what he wanted: a challenge that would allow him to raise his weapon against Chun Yeowun.\n“How can a Murim warrior say that? If you’re truly forming an alliance, then convince me—”\nGoooo!\nBefore he could say more, an unbelievable energy expanded in the atmosphere, and the suffocating feeling of the energy was only enhanced further by the terrifying silence.\n‘W-what a strong energy…’\nEven breathing was very difficult, and the effects of the energy weren’t limited to just Gu Cheong-sa. All of the Six Martial Masters became pale, feeling as if there were swords on their necks.\nStep!\nChun Yeowun slowly walked towards Gu Cheong-sa. With each step, Gu Cheong-sa’s face turned a more prominent shade of red.\n‘Move. I have to move my body!’\nHe tried to move his arm but it was to no avail as Chun Yeowun reached him.\nDrip!\nHis face was already drenched in sweat from his fear of dying. Chun Yeowun whispered in his ear,\n“Then should I kill you all instead of forming an alliance?”\n‘!?’\nHe spoke with a soft voice, but there was no way that the Six Martial Masters didn’t hear his words as all their eyes fluttered in shock.\n‘It’s possible.’\n‘This is… Demon God!’\n‘M-Monster…!’\nThe pressure was so overwhelming that they couldn’t think of anything else; in fact, this was the first time that they had such a strong pressure exerted on them. Only then did Gu Cheong-sa realize that the alliance was nothing more than a fa?ade to maintain the dignity of their clan.\nShh!\nChun Yeowun put his finger on the man’s forehead.\n“Kid. Have you changed your mind yet?”\nIt felt like the finger could pierce his head any moment. Gu Cheong-sa gulped and said,\n“I… I made a mistake.”\n“Then you know what you’re supposed to say.”\n“T-thank you for forming an alliance.”\nHearing Gu Cheong-sa’s words, Hwang-heol trembled out of anger.\nBecause of one stupid subordinate, the fa?ade was no more.",

      "content": "Chapter 174: TQC Code (1)\nAll the Yongchun and Blade Six executives gathered in the conference room of the Yongchun Group.\nHowever, at the top of it were Chun Yeowun and Hwang-heol, who were the heads of both sides.\nHwang-heol was holding a laser pointer in his hand, showing a specific location on the 3D map on the table.\n“There are currently 38 estimated locations. After tracing them, we searched through 483 places, and the remaining places are those that are yet to be checked.”\nBlade Six had searched the outside of the gate whenever they had a chance after signing an agreement with the Ministry of National Defense and tried to get the locations for ten long years.\nThe search appeared to take a long time at first glance, but given it was done only when the gates were unlocked, it was astounding.\n“Then it means that one of those 38 places is the MS Group’s base.”\n“\nCough\n, unless they suddenly decide to move their place, I can guarantee that there is a 90% chance of us being right.”\nHwang-heol said in a confident voice. It was reliable information.\nThe reliability of the information was high as the time when the Blade Six was under surveillance after the prison act wasn’t too long.\n“38 places…”\nInvestigating those places alone will determine the base of MS Group.\n“How do we help?”\nHwang-heol answered Chun Yeowun’s question.\n“There is no need to look for them. In any case, this is what we've been doing. We only require some minor assistance.”\n“Tell me.”\n“The right to explore outside the gate barrier.”\nExcept for the government and Yongchun Group, no one could head out. The agreement with Yongchun Group was permission to wander outside freely even without any Gate warning.\n[Ancestor.]\nChun Yu-jang reached out to Chun Yeowon through telepathy.\n[The alliance had formed because of the command of our Ancestor, but we have been in a hostile relationship with them for a thousand years. Wouldn’t it be dangerous to just give them what they want?]\nThe right to move freely beyond the Gate barrier was an authority any Murim warrior and clan would want, so Chun Yu-jang was wary of the Blade Six.\nChun Yeowun smiled.\n“Good. I will contact the minister of Defense and give you the rights.”\n[A-ancestor!]\nChun Yu-jang was perplexed at how the man ignored his opinion. However, that wasn’t all.\n“However, if you go outside the barrier to search, you take people from our clan outside. Do you agree?”\n“I do.”\nHwang-heol said that he was fine with it.\nIf the authority was passed on without any condition, then it wouldn’t be long before Blade Six took over the power. Chun Yeowun blocked that in advance.\n“Good.”\n”We should be thankful for that. And hmm… There is one more…”\n“What do you mean?”\nHwang-heol slowly showed a news article. It was the fake news about Geum Seong-ryong being involved in the prison act. Now, Blade Six was having a hard time moving properly because of this case, and all their contracts were terminated.\n“What about it?”\n“… Senior, you know it wasn’t me.”\nGeum Seong-ryong said carefully to Chun Yeowun. They were asked to clear up the public misunderstanding.\nAt that, Chun Yeowun smiled and said,\n“Isn’t that something you should do on your own?”\n“Huh?”\nGeum Seong-ryong, who thought that the alliance would help in the matter, was flustered by Chun Yeowun’s answer. Currently, he wasn’t indicted or anything, but the government was wary of him.\n“If my charges are dropped, the scope of movement will…”\n“It happened before the alliance. That is your task.”\n“How…?”\nChun Yeowun pointed to the Lord of the cult, Chun Woo-jin.\n“Our current Lord has been imprisoned for at least 27 years. That, too, was because he had been framed.”\nGeum Seong-ryong was silent at it. He was a party involved in the case. He too had been one of the Murim warriors who was tasked to check the marks on the dead people.\n“Be grateful that you aren't being forced to accept responsibility for it.”\n“…”\nGeum Seong-ryeong and Hwang-heol said nothing about it.\n‘Indeed!’\nOn the other hand, the members of the Yongchun Group nodded their heads. In their hearts, they were all worried that Chun Yeowun would concede because of the alliance, but that didn’t seem to be the case.\nThe alliance negotiations were all done.\nUltimately, the details were decided by the Chairman and the Executives, and most of them were finalized by Chun Yeowun and Hwang-heol.\nFrom now on, it's a race against time. Blade Six will do everything they can to find MS Group. And Yongchun Group decided to help the broken contracts of Blade Six to their side. It was a temporary solution, but in the long term, Blade Six would have to rely solely on Yongchun.\nOf course, Blade Six will do everything to restore their honor.\nIn the conference room after Blade Six left, Bi Makpheon handed over a phone to Chun Yeowun.\n-Teacher.\n“Ark Young.”\nIt was Ark Young, the descendant of Ark Wui and Chun Yeowun’s disciple. He had been moved to Russian thanks to\nE\n’s ability.\n“I heard what happened.”\n-I feel so embarrassed.\nArk Young wanted to connect directly with Chun Yeowun. However, he waited due to the all-out war that happened.\n“Where did you say you are now?”\n-Near the city of Bratsk.\nBratsk is a small town in Irkutsk Oblast, Russia. He wanted to enter the city, but Ark Young didn’t have a passport and didn’t know Russian, so he couldn’t get through the wall.\n-Teacher. I am sorry, but could you please send someone who can understand Russian and my passport here?\nIt’s impossible to wander outside the wall forever since the outside wall was full of toxic substances. It wasn’t good to be exposed to such things for long, even if it was Ark Young.\n“I know. Keep your smartphone on. They will come.”\n-I am sorry for all this.\n“It isn’t your fault. Don’t worry.”\n-Thank you for saying that. I’ll wait.\nChun Yeowun hung up the phone.\nHe was planning to meet the descendants of the North Sea Ice palace who had gone to the Olkhon Island of Lake Baikal in Russia.\nLooking at the executives, ChunYeowun said,\n“I will go to Russia for a while, it won’t take long so…”\n“L-Lord.”\nBaekgi had called for him.\n“What?”\n“Would you mind stepping back with the three of us for a moment?”\nChun Yeowun was puzzled at it. The three were Mun Ran-yeong, Hu Bong and Baekgi.\nChun Woo-jin, who noticed it, stood up and said,\n“Ancestor, it seems like they have something to tell you. We will now take our leave.”\nAfter he got up, the others followed him and left after they bowed.\nEven Yu So-hwa, Im So-hye, and Shakena too went out.\nThen Baekgi said,\n“Lord. I heard from Hu Bong and Great Elder that you know the reason why we were hibernating.”\n“Yes.”\nThey had a code divided into three parts left behind by Chun Mu-seong. It was the location of the time pack which was arranged for Chun Yeowun to access and come back to his era according to the seer called Seong Mu-chun.\n“Lord. What Lord is doing is important, but I believe that finding that divine artifact as soon as possible is the right thing.”\nMun Ran-yeong too nodded at it.\n“Baekgi is right. I too believe that, and with Baekgi, who was in the MS Group’s hands, I think that the divine artifact might have fallen into their hands, so retrieving it in advance seemed to be the right thing to do right now.”\n“Oh! I think the same too, Lord.”\n“… Please, you didn’t think the same.”\nHu Bong’s lips twitched at Baekgi’s words.\nThe trio thought the same. They thought retrieving it as soon as possible was the right thing to do.\n“… I see.”\nChun Yeowun had been thinking about it as well ever since Baekgi regained his consciousness. If his guess was right, this divine artifact has to be a time pack.\n“\nPhew.\n”\nHe sighed.\nThe time machine can be used by one person only. From the perspective of his subordinates, they didn’t mind dying for this, but Chun Yeowun couldn’t accept their sacrifice.\n‘Right. That needs to be brought back.’\nOnly then can he analyze it and produce it. However, since the time pack was a future thing, there was a high probability of the materials not being available and Nano being locked.\nWhei!\nMun Ran-yeong, who has become a bit proficient in modern culture, put a touch screen tablet on the table.\n“I will draw my part.”\nShe sketched something on the white screen. A total of 36 triangles of various sizes were drawn.\n“Huh? My wife’s drawings are different from mine.”\nNext, Hu Bong sketched his 36 combinations of rectangles and squares. The last was Baekgi. Baekgi had circles and 36 different triangles.\n‘TQC Code.’\nThe TQC Code, a cipher, was created around the year 2600. TQC Code can be interpreted by forming a combination of Triangle, Quadrangle, and Circle. It was a code that was completely impossible to interpret if one of the three people was missing.\nThe descendant, Chun Mu-seong, had taken measures to prevent the loss of the item.\n‘Can you interpret it, Nano?’\n[I will scan the TQC Code.]\nChun Yeowun’s eyes trembled as the code was scanned. The scanned code was superimposed into one location in augmented reality and then turned into a complex barcode-like pattern.\n[TQC Code combination complete. Decrypt the password.]\nIt didn’t take long to crack it. Not long after, the map of China was shown and numerous red lines were drawn on it, all converged at one point.\nWheing!\nThe location was…\n‘Hubei?’\nIt was at Hubei. It was a location far from Jinan City. While Chun Yeowun was looking at it, it seemed like a mountain valley.\n“Hmm.”\nHowever, there was a weird thing. If his memory was correct, the place was quite close to the coordinates that Hwang-heol pointed to as MS Group’s base. The distance was around 1 to 2 km different.\nIt felt like what he feared was becoming real.\n‘I need to hurry.’\nIf he had been there before then maybe he had been there once.\n‘Have I been to that place?’\nAs he asked in his thoughts, Nano answered,\n[Coordinates 31°23'38.6\"N 110°16'23.8\"E. This is a place the user has been to before.]\n‘What?’\nSo it’s really a location Chun Yeowun had been to? As he was puzzled, a video played in his eyes.\n‘This is…’\nThe Dead Sword Valley. A long time ago, it was the place where his ancestor, Chun Ma, and Blade God had fought. It was the place where the mountain sank to the bottom and created the valley.\n‘It was hidden there.’\nIt was the most unexpected place. In any case, it was better if it was still there. Since it was a place Chun Yeowun once visited then he could use the Spatial Movement.\n“Lord, do you understand it?” Hu Bong asked.\nChun Yeowun looked at them and said,\n“We are moving right now.”\nA shower room full of hot steam.\nSwosh!\nA naked woman drenched in warm water from the shower with her eyes closed. The woman was appreciating the jazz music as she moved her body to the flow of music. She liked ending her day like this.\nIn front of the half-open shower booth, was a Bluetooth speaker, a large towel, and a silver mask with a mark\nC\n.\n“Mmm~”\nShe was enjoying the music but then she stopped humming.\nGrunt!\n‘!?’\nA crack appeared in the wall to the left of the shower, and a strange thing happened.\nIt felt like the wall parted and something appeared. The strange thing flinched.\n“Uh!”\n“Kyaaak!”\nCrack!\nStartled, she moved back forcefully, breaking the glass wall and falling. The man who seemed like he was stuck in the wall said with a frown,\n“D-damn it! Lord. Wall-I am in a wall!”\nIt was Hu Bong who was caught in the wall. The naked woman, who couldn’t understand what was happening, slowly lifted her head and looked behind her as she felt something weird.\nBehind her was a woman with red hair and a man in a black suit and sharp eyes.\n‘T-this man?’\nThe naked woman couldn’t hide her shock.\nChun Yeowun, who was looking at her expression, asked.\n“You… seem to know me.”",

      "content": "Chapter 175: TQC Code (2)\nThe naked woman was so beautiful that she would cause anyone to exclaim once they saw her, but Chun Yeowun’s expression didn’t change one bit.\nRather, she was the only person who was concerned about the situation, as she was on the ground using her long hair to cover her chest out of shame.\n“L-Lord!”\nHu Bong, who was halfway stuck in a wall, called for Chun Yeowun’s help. At the sight, Baekgi shook his head and said,\n“Stop playing around and come out.”\n“Hehe.”\nCrack!\nHu Bong chuckled and then broke the shower room wall as he came out. Hu Bong, who possessed enough agility to easily break through the steel, was just fooling around by acting stuck in the bricks of the walls.\n‘Hm.’\nChun Yeowun looked around. He was definitely where the coordinates were pointing, but he never expected to appear in a shower room. The problem wasn’t the location, but rather how TQC code was hidden.\n‘That?’\nChun Yeowun’s eyes were gleaming as he held out his hand to pull in the mask next to the Bluetooth speaker.\nThe letter\nC\nwas engraved on the surface of the mask.\n“Ha!”\nChun Yeowun felt thrilled, as this was just what he was hoping for.\n“You… seem to be one of the 10.”\n‘!!!’\nHearing Chun Yeowun’s words, her face turned red as she no longer had anything to hide.\n‘He knows who I am?’\nHer true identity was\nC\n, one of the ten executives; unlike the other executives who were replaceable, she was a key executive.\n‘Chun Mu-seong!’\nAnd in a few seconds, she managed to recognize the man’s identity. She had never dreamed that he would ever come into her hidden base.\n“You people seem to be using this place as a base.”\nChun Yeowun was feeling nervous: the presence of one of MS Group's executives meant that the whereabouts of the item left behind by his descendant could be compromised.\n“Lord Chun Ma.”\nMn Ran-yeong’s voice was full of worry, and Chun Yeowun looked at the\nC\n, who was on the ground. It seemed they all wanted to interrogate her to know exactly when MS Group began to settle at this location and if they had touched Chun Mu-seong's item.\n“Woman–”\nIt was then:\nKwang! Kwang!\nThe sound of something shattering with strong vibrations resonated throughout the building. When everyone looked toward the direction of the sound, the wall shattered and something flew at a great speed.\n“Where does it think it's coming to!”\nHu Bong quickly tried to block the foreign projectile with his sword,\nClank!\n“What?”\nPak! Kwang!\nHu Bong’s sword broke, causing his body to bounce back as it broke through a wall.\nKwakwang!\n“How dare you!”\nMun Ran-yeong, enraged at what she had just witnessed, hurried to move her husband away from any danger and unfolded a defense technique.\nPapak!\n‘!?’\nMun Ran-yeong’s eyes fluttered at the opponent, who didn’t seem to budge despite her using the best defense technique of her clan.\nShe wondered if some monster had appeared, but surprisingly a woman with unique colored clothes emerged.\n“3rd Guest!”\nC\n’s expression had brightened once she saw the woman; on the other hand, Mun Ran-yeong's expression darkened.\n‘What is this feeling?’\nThe feeling wasn’t her internal energy being blocked, but rather that of hitting a solid rock. Most people would suffer from internal injuries if they didn’t have an equal understanding of internal energy, but the defense technique didn’t seem to be working against this woman.\n“I was curious about what kind of rats came, but I see it was just you.”\nThe woman in unique colored clothes, called the 3rd Guest, tried to swing her fist towards Mun Ran-yeong’s chest.\n“Kuak!”\nMun Ran-yeong reflexively leaned back. At that moment, Baekgi moved in to kick the woman’s left ribs.\nPak!\n‘!?’\nBaekgi frowned. He always managed to keep up with Mun Ran-yeong, so he thought he had a chance against this woman, but his foot was hurt rather than the woman’s legs.\n‘Why am I feeling this?’\nKicking the woman’s ribs felt like kicking a pillar made of some kind of steel with his bare feet.\n“You… broke my leg?”\nThe 3rd Guest changed her path and decided to really break Baekgi’s leg, as it was still in the vicinity of her ribs, but Baekgi managed to react instantly.\nKwaang!\nHer clenched fist had gone through the floor because Baekgi was able to pull out his leg at the last second. However, the moment her fist reached the ground, a crater was left in the ground; the 3rd Guest indeed held immense power.\n‘What kind of power is that?’\nThere was no trace of any martial arts or internal energy from the woman. In fact, it seemed like her power didn’t come from internal energy but rather pure muscle strength, but it was hard to believe because her body didn’t show any noticeable muscle mass.\nPhat!\nBaekgi quickly extended his leg once more towards her chest and face, kicking 8 times in succession.\nPapapak!\n‘She isn’t even moving?’\nBaekgi couldn’t hide his shock when his leg began to bleed with each kick while her body didn’t seem to be bothered by his relatively powerful attack.\n“Haap!”\nWoong!\nBecause the space was very enclosed, Baekgi couldn’t exert much force and thus decided to change his tactics. He decided to wrap his feet and cover his leg with Invisible Energy.\nPapapak!\nThe woman's body was now being pushed back by the kicks that had their power amplified, but Baekgi wasn’t satisfied yet.\n‘She could handle this too?’\nIt didn’t make any sense. Just who was this woman?\n“You bastard!”\nThe woman was enraged at Baekgi for making her feel pain, so she tried to move when someone grabbed her body.\n“That’s enough.”\nIt was Chun Yeowun.\n‘Hm?’\nChun Yeowun, who held her, narrowed his eyes. He tried to seal her blood points right away, but that didn’t seem to work. He then realized:\n‘No blood points?’\nHumans should have blood points in the same spots in their bodies, but the woman’s body didn’t seem to have any. He was further confused when the woman said,\n“Definitely different from what I heard.”\nC\nshouted,\n“If we don’t catch him, this sector is at risk, 3rd Guest.”\n“I thought I wouldn’t have to deal with him, but I guess I can’t run from this ordeal.”\nAs soon as she said that, something amazing happened: a yellow light began to glow from her eyes right before a beam was shot from them.\nSwoosh!\nChun Yeowun, who was hit point blank, bounced back and flew through the wall.\nKwakwakwang!\n“Lord!”\nBaekgi and Mun Ran-yeong shouted out of their concern for him. In the midst of the chaos,\nC\ngrabbed a towel, wrapped her body with it, and put on her mask.\n‘I’m glad Elena showed up.’\nShe fully trusted Elena, which was the true name of the 3rd Guest. Although she was called as a Guest, she was a superhuman within MS Group.\nIn other words, she transcended other human beings.\n‘Strictly speaking, there is nothing human about her.’\nOf course, she had come out of the Gate.\nSince she had come out alone from the Gate, she would technically be labeled as a Special Entity. Unlike the other three Guests, she couldn’t leave this place because she made a contract, but this was actually beneficial for MS.\nPhat!\nElena ran towards Chun Yeowun with the rage of a frenzied rhinoceros, seeming like she wanted to crush his body.\nKwakwakwang!\nPak!\nAs she dashed to kill him, Chun Yeowun stopped her while she was still moving. Elena, who looked at Chun Yeowun holding her, was shocked.\n“You… you seem strong.”\nOnly a few people had even been strong enough to stop her, but Chun Yeowun didn’t even seem to have trouble doing so.\n“Then try this!”\nSince her hand was being restrained, Elena used her leg to kick Chun Yeowun’s neck.\nPuck!\n‘!?’\nHer expression hardened; although she definitely hit his neck, she was surprised when the neck didn’t break and when Chun Yeowun didn’t even try to move.\n“Are you done?”\n“You… are you human?”\nWhen it came to pure physical strength, Elena was considered a monster. However, after undergoing 5 bodily reconstructions, Chun Yeowun had already surpassed the limits of the human body and was now at the Void Master level, meaning that his internal energy surpassed that of the Spirit Beasts.\nElena smiled and said,\n“Interesting. This is my first time seeing a human like you.”\n‘She’s definitely not a human.’\nHearing her words, Chun Yeowun knew that she wasn’t human; her lack of blood points tipped him off, but he still looked for solid proof.\n‘Well, it doesn’t matter.’\nAfter all, he had seen so many non-humans that he developed a tolerance for them and didn’t show any surprise anymore.\nElena looked at him with excitement.\n“Great. In this era, you, an earthling, and I, who have lived in a place with a gravitational strength 100 times that of Earth, shall compete to see who is the strongest of—”\nKwang!\nBefore she could finish speaking, Chun Yeowun smashed her head with his fist.\nHer neck was bent to the side by the fist that was infused with the unification of energy, causing her to collapse to the floor.\nEven though her neck was bent, she still spoke,\n“I was talking to you, coward!”\nChun Yeowun quickly closed the gap.\n“Right, you talk a lot.”\nWhile she was on her knees trying to get up, he used his knee to hit her in the stomach.\nKwang!\n“Ack!”\nShe normally didn’t feel pain from any physical blows, but this one was different; the unification of energy that focused all of the focused energy on one part of the body made her feel intense pain despite her strong body.\n“Eik!”\nShe was angry that Chun Yeowun wasn't giving her a chance to move, deciding to shoot another light beam from her eyes.\nSwosh!\nHowever, the space between them where the beam should have traveled suddenly distorted when a black hole seemed to appear and suck in the yellow beam.\n“What was that?”\n“Did you think the same trick would work again?”\nAs soon as he said that, Chun Yeowun raised his fist again and slammed it into her stomach.\nBang!\n“Ack!”\nAs a crater in the floor formed from the force, the two fell down again. While she was falling, the woman tried to move away from Chun Yeowun.\nPak!\nBefore she could go anywhere, Chun Yeowun quickly grabbed by her neck.\n“Where are you going?”\n“L-Let me go!”\nEven though Chun Yeowun was falling as well, he was able to slap her in the face once again. However, her superhuman body allowed her to remain unharmed despite the force he had exerted.\n“Uh, uh! Leee!”\nHer mouth was mangled by the slap, slurring her pronunciation. A normal human would have died from the impact, but this woman definitely wasn’t a human. In fact, her face turned back to normal right after and she didn’t show any signs of pain.\n“You bastard! I will kill you!”\nElena’s face, which was back to normal spoke, normally. Chun Yeowun responded,\n“You’re interesting. How much force should I use for you to feel a pain so unbearable you’ll be asking for death?”\n‘!?’\nHearing those words, her eyes shuddered.\nKwang! Kwang! Kwakwang!\nThe sounds of roaring created the atmosphere of an intense war. The vibrations were so strong that the tiles in the room were falling off.\nC\n, who felt the immense power, spoke to Chun Yeowun’s subordinates with a firm voice,\n“Hear that sound? If you stop this now and surrender, I can guarantee your lives.”\nIn response, Hu Bong pointed his sword at her neck.\n“What bullshit!”\nBaekgi snarled in a low voice. She wanted to run away while they were occupied with the fight happening below, but she couldn’t move because these three were too fast.\n“This sector is my base and pride! It would be better to let go of the delusion that you can get out of here alive. Can’t you hear the sounds of their fight slowing down?”\nAs she said, the sounds of battling from below were slowing down, to which\nC\nsmiled and continued.\n“You must realize that the existence of Chun Ma that you believe so much is nothing more than a human when compared to the group with hidden pow–”\nThud!\nSomething appeared in front of her.\n‘!!!’\nC\n, who looked at what suddenly appeared, went stiff.\nIt was Elena, the 3rd Guest, whose face was a mess and whose arms and legs were both cut down, making her form hard to recognize.\n“W-what is thi–”\nSeeing her flustered reaction, Hu Bong smiled.\n“It seems you’re the one who doesn’t understand. Hehe.”",

      "content": "Chapter 176: Change (1)\n‘No way!’\nC\ndesperately wanted to deny this reality.\nElena is a superhuman who lived in a place with a gravity that was more than a hundred times greater than Earth's. For her, the hardness and strength of things on Earth wasn't much different from styrofoam.\n‘And such a monster is like this?’\nAs if cutting down her limbs wasn’t enough, she now looked like smashed dough.\n‘But she is a woman…’\nStep! Step!\nThe expression displayed on Chun Yeowun’s face as he walked close to\nC\nwas unbearable for her. He looked like a merciless human being.\nC\nwas horrified of this situation.\n“Quite a pretty interesting physique.”\nChun Yeowun glanced at Elena, whom he had thrown to the floor. He had completely paralyzed her body by repeatedly beating her until she looked like a smashed dough. He also tried to turn her into a Ghost but she didn’t change into one.\nSince she has a completely different body structure, he had to incapacitate her like this so she wouldn’t be able to rise again.\nC\n’s face had darkened.\nLosing a hidden power like this, she trembled as she asked.\n“What will you do with me?”\n“Depends on your answers and actions.”\nAt his words, she bit her lip.\nHu Bong, who was looking at her frightened expression, said,\n“It seems like the situation has changed. Hehe.”\nJust a little while ago, she was asking them to surrender.\nGlaring at Hu Bong, she said,\n“I am sorry, but there is nothing I can tell you. I can’t speak even if I want to. Don’t you know that already?”\nAll the researchers in the MS Group contained nano bombs in their bodies and were prepared to use them if they exposed the information.\n“Well.”\nChun Yeowun showed a questionable reaction.\nIt was because Chun Yeowun heard from\nH\n, one of the executives he recruited, about the 10 Executives and the difference of\nB\nand\nC\nfrom the rest.\n[Just because they are the 10 Executives doesn't mean the same person will be there each time. Most of the researchers who are at their best are known to be promoted. However, there is a difference with B and C.]\n[What is the difference?]\n[I heard that they were there for a very long time. It was to the extent that even the others in the 10 couldn’t guess their age.]\n[Really?]\nChun Yeowun remembered that.\n“Are you one of the two pawns guarding this place?”\n“…”\nC\ndidn’t respond to it. She already heard from\nA\nthat\nH\nmight have changed sides. Considering that, a lot of information must have flowed to Chun Yeowun so his question wasn’t surprising.\n“We are just working together for a long time.”\nC\nanswered casually.\nShe had regained her composure.\n“But they seem to put a ban on you like you are everyone else.”\n“There is no point in interrogating me like this. If you really want to know if what I am saying is a lie, you can check.”\nShe looked at Chun Yeowun. It was like she was gambling her life. And since she was the pawn on the head of this place, she was able to accurately understand her body condition unlike the others.\n‘We will know what you are planning to do.’\nThe ban wasn’t placed on her. She was one of the early members of the MS Group, so like Chun Yeowun expected, there was no ban on her.\nChun Yeowun stared at her confident eyes telling him to decide.\n“It would be difficult to expect it to work right away.”\n“Huh?”\n“Why was this base built here? Wasn’t there something else in this place?”\nChun Yeowun kept asking questions to her.\nShe shook her head.\n“I am not going to answer.”\n“Where is the base of your commander and\nB\n?”\n“… Are you ignoring my words?”\nShe couldn’t understand why he was asking. It was like he didn’t expect her to answer anything.\n“What is the secret of this base?”\n“…”\nShe didn’t answer further. Chun Yeowun asked her 3 questions and decided to make her a ghost to read her memories.\n“I clearly said that I couldn’t answer. You are really wasting your time.”\n“No. This much is good enough.”\nChun Yeowun brought out the Sky Demon Sword which was around his wrist. A gloomy cold blue light moved from his hand. Chun Yeowun tried to reach out to make her a Ghost but her reaction seemed weird.\n‘Huh?’\nIn the eyes of Hu Bong, who was aiming the sword at\nC\n, a strange light flickered in her eyes. The corners of her mouth twitching, clearly meant she was up to something.\n“What are you trying to do?!”\nHu Bong put the sword closer to her neck to prevent her from trying anything.\nShh!\nAt that moment, shock appeared in her eyes.\n‘This!’\nIt was then. Hu Bong fell to the floor like a doll with broken threads.\nThud!\n“Hu Bong!”\nAs that happened, Baekgi flashed right away to hold him. But it wasn’t just Hu Bong who fell.\nEven\nC\nwho was being made into a Ghost also fell to the floor.\nThud!\n‘What happened?’\nChun Yeowun was puzzled by two people who fell down at the same time. He wondered if this was one of her tricks.\nJust a second ago, he felt a foreign energy the moment Hu Bong’s sword touched her neck.\nShhh!\nWhen Chun Yeowun held out his hand, the collapsed body of the woman stood up. It was because it seemed like this woman’s ability had something to do with physical contact.\n‘No useful information.’\nUnfortunately, even Oh Hyun-gu didn’t seem to have information about\nC\n’s ability. It was understandable since the information of\nA\n,\nB,\nand\nC\nwere known to be confidential.\n“\nUm.\n”\nAt that time,\nC\n, who was unconscious, slowly opened her eyes.\nShe looked at Chun Yeowun and said,\n“Lord?”\n“… What?”\nChun Yeowun was dumbfounded. He was at a loss for words for a moment at her words.\n“Ugh! What the hell! L-Lord. Lord! Why is my voice sounding like a woman?”\n“What…”\nNo matter how he looked, it seemed similar to Hu Bong’s way of speaking. He couldn’t understand how\nC\ncould even imitate that.\nIn the brief moment that he was shocked, he asked.\n“You, woman. What are you up to?”\n“Eh? Lord?! Are you calling me a woman now? No. First, call back this energy… Uh?”\nC\nlowered her head. As the energy had lifted up the body, the towel stayed on the floor. Looking down at the breasts which were out open, her face turned red and she said,\n“Huhahaha.”\n‘!?’\nBaekgi frowned.\nJust now, that snorting sound was very similar to the time when Hu Bong would snort at excitement.\nIt was then.\nPuak!\n“Kuk!”\nSomething sharp had pierced his armpit which wasn’t covered in suit. Baekgi sensed this at the moment of being stabbed and released the grasps around Hu Bong’s body and stepped back.\nTatatak!\n“You!”\nHe looked at Hu Bong. He was supporting Hu Bong’s body which fell.\n“Bong-bong? What is this?”\nMun ra-yeong was unable to understand Hu Bong who attacked Baekgi. However, Hu Bong shook his head and Chun Yeowun used energy to stop the body of Hu Bong, who mumbled.\n“Suddenly intervening.\nSigh.\n”\nHu Bong seemed to have some kind of hostility against\nC\n. and\nC\non the other hand, who was also being controlled by energy, was flustered at the sight of Hu Bong looking at him.\n“Lo-Lord! Those aren’t my eyes, right? Why am I there? Wait…”\nHu Bong lowered his head again. His face was red in heat.\n“Lord… isn’t this her body?”\nAt\nC\n’s words, Chun Yeowun looked at Hu Bong. With that alone, he knew what happened.\nLooking at Hu Bong he said,\n“Woman. You changed the bodies.”\nHu Bong raised his hand covering his lips like a woman and smiled.\n“Hohoho. You noticed it faster than I imagined.”\nMun Ran-yeong was shocked at the sight.\n“What is this…”\nSome bitch was in her husband’s body, and this was the most absurd thing anyone could experience.\nHu Bong– No,\nC,\nwho was in his body, said, as if it was a pity,\n“I could have made your body mine if your dumb subordinate hadn't intervened. Such a shame.”\nHer ability is Change. It was the ability to exchange one’s soul or mind for another. That was how\nC\nhad been able to live as the henchmen of the head of MS Group for long.\n‘I could have stolen that monster’s body.’\nShe truly felt bad. If only she could take Chun Yeowun’s body then the entire situation would have been solved.\n“I, why am I a woman?! Gosh! I am a woman!”\nIt was the moment when Hu Bong was excited looking down at the breasts.\nHe was shocked at the reality that was happening.\nWheik!\nFlames erupted from Mun Ran-yeong’s body.\nWith rage clearly visible on her face, she looked at\nC\nwho was in Hu Bong’s body and said,\n“Right now! Get out of my husband’s body!”\nEven though the walls of the shower room were about to melt,\nC\nraised her hands and asked her to calm down.\n“Woah! Woah! I wouldn’t recommend doing that. Just because I die doesn't mean that I will go back to normal, right?”\n“What?”\nMun Ran-yeong was bewildered and\nC\nlooked at Chun Yeowun and said,\n“Literally. If you kill me, your subordinate’s body will die. He will be trapped in that body for the rest of your life.”\nHu Bong, who was in\nC\n’s body, couldn't hide his shock.\n“No!”\nIf his body was destroyed, then his precious body which gave up years of his life to learn martial arts would turn into nothing.\nFurthermore,\n“Then how will I have a child with my wife…”\n“Yah!!!”\nMun Ran-yeong, embarrassed at it, yelled.\nHu Bong went silent at it.\n“Tch tch.”\nC\n, who was in Hu Bong’s body, shook her head as if watching a comedy said to Chun Yeowun,\n“Do you want his body back?”\nShe raised her eyes, thinking that she had an advantage in the situation.\n“Fufu… Let’s start negotiating properly…”\nKwang!\nBefore she could continue to speak, stars appeared in front of her eyes. It was due to a blow to her head. When she got up, her vision was dark. She couldn’t see anything.\n‘W-what?’\nIt looked like something had been blocked. However, the body was freely moving. Strictly speaking, it felt like something was swaying.\nKwang!\nSomething like a mighty force pulled her out. That was when she realized that her head was hit into the ceiling.\n“What are you…”\nKwang!\n“\nKuak!\n”\nBefore she could speak, the head was pierced into the ceiling again. It hurt so much that she wanted to cry, and yelled out in shock.\n“W-what are you doing? Do you care if your subordinates get hurt?”\nAt her words, Chun Yeowun spoke in a blank expression.\n“You made one mistake.”\n“Huh?”\nHe spoke to her, as she was flustered.\n“Hu Bong’s body is quite strong.”\n‘!?’",

      "content": "Chapter 177: Change (2)\nBang!\n“Kuak!”\nA roar and a scream sounded to everyone in the vicinity. Mun Ran-yeong, who couldn’t bear to look at the scene, turned her head to the side.\nHu Bong’s body was being bumped into the wall rapidly, so she couldn’t bear to look.\nKwang!\n“Kuak!”\nHowever,\nC\n, who was in Hu Bong’s body, was definitely suffering from the pain, as she felt like she would die anytime. She was aiming to negotiate with Chun Yeowun by using his subordinate, but he seemed to be inflicting pain on his own subordinate's body without care.\n‘Ugh! Is this body useless, or is he just a monster?’\nAlthough she couldn’t read the memories of the bodies she took over, she could freely use the body’s powers; however, Hu Bong’s body felt powerless.\nCrack!\nWhat annoyed her the most was Hu Bong’s regenerative power. Even if his neck was broken, it didn’t take long to begin repairing itself. And thanks to that, Chun Yeowun was able to continuously hurt the body.\nBang!\n“Ack! Stop! Enough! Please!”\nC\nbegged Chun Yeowun.\nThe constant banging seemed to be causing her to lose her senses, but Chun Yeowun said,\n“You know what will make this stop.”\nAfter saying those words, Chun Yeowun moved his hand, and the arms belonging to Hu Bong’s body were bent back and broken.\nCrack!\n“Aaack!”\nThe pain didn't stop this time, causing\nC\nto keep screaming. However, she had only decided to persevere because, despite the man’s position as Chun Yeowun’s subordinate and the body’s regenerative power, she figured that he wouldn’t be cruel enough to inflict such lasting pain.\n“Go back to normal.”\nChun Yeowun waved his hand, breaking the fingers of the already broken hand.\nC\nfelt pain all over her body, and was struggling to continue this act.\n‘Please!’\nMun Ran-yeong was clenching her fists so tightly that blood gushed out of her flesh from her nails digging in. As her husband was in pain, there was no way she would be fine.\n“Ha… Ha… I won’t.”\nDespite the pain,\nC\nrefused, causing Chun Yeowun’s eyes to glow.\n‘Quite stubborn.’\nChun Yeowun knew that inflicting such pain on his own subordinate was terrible, but the woman who was enduring was very formidable in tolerance.\n“Think rationally.”\n“If I… turn back… you’ll surely kill me.”\nShe was aware of the fact that her life would be in jeopardy the moment the souls were returned to their original state.\nChun Yeowun responded with a cold voice,\n“I’m starting to want to do that more and more.”\n“Haaa… what I said was right. Unfortunately for you, if I remain in this body, you can never kill me.”\n“Are you sure about that?”\n“Well, you haven’t given me any fatal wounds yet.”\nShe smiled through the pain. Like she said, there weren’t fatal injuries inflicted yet and limbs were still connected with an intact dantian.\n‘Annoying.’\nPossessors of the blood of Spirit Beasts obtained an excellent regenerative power, but there was still a limit.\nChun Yeowun was immortal, meaning that even if his limbs were cut off, he could regenerate them again, but not Hu Bong.\nC\nlaughed,\n“Kik. I have lived for six hundred years. Do you think I haven’t felt this level of pain before? Give up.”\n“Phew.”\nChun Yeowun sighed. It seemed like there was no use in hurting her.\nChun Yeowun looked at Hu Bong and Mun Ran-yeong, who were both worried sick about Hu Bong’s body and said,\n“I apologize to both of you.”\n“Huh?”\nMun Ran-yeong had an anxious expression as Chun Yeowun grabbed his sword, and spoke,\n“Being reasonable won’t work here.”\nAs soon as he finished speaking, he tried to swing the sword towards\nC\n, but then:\nShh!\nSomeone appeared, grabbing Chun Yeowun’s wrist and lifting it.\nChachacha!\nChun Yeowun quickly formed swords to attack the hand that was holding his wrist, drawing blood instantly.\n“Who are you?”\nShh!\nBaekgi and Mun Ra-yeong appeared on either side of the person who appeared. However, the man exerted a strong energy that the two couldn’t pierce.\n“This is like jumping into a tiger’s jaw.”\nThe man who grabbed Chun Yeowun’s wrist and had his wrist maimed mumbled. His hair and eyebrows were noticeably red.\nAlthough he was wearing sunglasses, Chun Yeowun could see him looking at him intently.\n“2nd Guest!”\nC\n, still in Hu Bong’s body, yelled with a bright face. However, the face soon darkened when she remembered that even the 3rd Guest Elena couldn’t handle Chun Yeowun.\n“2nd Guest, Protocol 3! We need to hurry–”\nCrack!\nBefore she could finish her words, Chun Yeowun controlled the surrounding energy to crush her jaw.\n“You must be an important person.”\nThis man was strong enough to intervene and even change the direction of Chun Yeowun’s swing. Of course, it came at the cost of the injury apparent along his arm.\n“How long are you going to hold me for?”\nChun Yeowun asked, looking at his wrist.\nAn incomparable energy rose around Chun Yeowun’s wrist.\nTremble!\nThe 2nd Guest’s eyebrows rose when he saw that the hand he was using to hold Chun Yeowun wouldn’t stop shaking.\nThe 2nd Guest said, as if surprised,\n“Ha! This is really amazing. With this kind of power, it would be believable to say that you’ve completed the style of Songi.”\n“Songi?”\n“Holding on longer will be tough.”\nPak!\nUnable to stand the energy, he took his hand off Chun Yeowun’s wrist. And that moment, Baekgi and Mun Ran-yeong got ready to kill him.\nFlutter.\nThe 2nd Guest stretched out both his hands and rotated them as his sleeves stretched out, causing the energy around him to disperse.\n“What?”\n“What is this?”\nIt was their first time experiencing the energy dispersion. It wasn’t a technique of sorts, but rather the pure scattering of energy, so both of them were rightfully puzzled.\n‘He isn’t an ordinary person either.’\nPak!\nRight after the energy dispersion, Chun Yeowun stretched out a sword as quick as lightning towards the man’s forehead. A black haze was creeping out of the sword, revealing the Sky Demon Energy infused.\nThe power of the Invisible Sword with Sky Demon Energy was unimaginable.\n“EIk! This is really dangerous.”\nShh!\nThe space where the man stood shook the moment that the sword cut through the air.\nClash!\nThe space where the black sword fell was dyed black as the sound of air being ripped could be heard.\nChun Yeowun’s eyes narrowed.\n‘He folded the space?’\nTo others, it would have looked like the man moved very quickly to dodge the attack. However, Chun Yeowun, who realized that the space was manipulated, knew that it was fundamentally different from his Spatial Movement.\nIt was like looking at the ‘Shrinking Ground’ technique that ancestors were known to do in legends.\nTuk!\nThen, something fell on the floor: the arm of the 2nd Guest.\nShh!\nAt the same time that his arm fell, the 2nd Guest appeared behind\nC\n, who still kept the body she exchanged with Hu Bong.\n2nd Guest who looked at the fallen arm, was bewildered as he said,\n“You cut off my arm.”\nHe didn’t seem to be in pain. Rather, he was stating a fact as if the severed arm was someone else’s.\n‘What is this about?’\nChun Yeowun was curious about this person even more. Unlike the woman who was called the 3rd Guest, this person was definitely human but he didn’t learn martial arts or have any internal energy either.\nThe energy that flowed out was so natural and pure that it was void of any evil or malice.\n‘Ah! The 2nd Guest can move through space?’\nC\n, in Hu Bong’s body, couldn't hide her joy. To be honest, she had initially hoped that the 2nd Guest would run away to inform the others about the situation, but seeing the scene unfold, it seemed like they could escape together.\n“2nd Guest, get me out please!”\nHowever, his response was unexpected.\n“You finally swapped bodies.”\n“Huh?”\n“There was nothing I could do about it before.”\n“What’s that supposed to mean? 2nd Guest, what are you thinking–”\nPapak!\nAt that moment,\nC\nreceived a shock and collapsed without waking up.\nChun Yeowun seemed puzzled at the 2nd Guest’s sudden action.\n“What are you doing?”\nHe didn’t think that the man would attack his own ally, but the man raised his arms and said with a smile,\n“I surrender.”\n“What?”\nThe word 'surrender' was unexpected. Chun Yeowun looked at him with vigilant eyes, unable to understand the reason for such an underwhelming yield.\n“What are you scheming?”\n“Like I said, I surrender.”\n“Are you messing around?”\n“Does it seem like I am? I can’t even stop the bleeding from the demonic energy seeping through this severed arm.”\nThe 2nd Guest raised his arm and spoke sarcastically. Blood continued to flow from the cut arm as a black haze was surrounding it. This was the sign that the Sky Demon Energy was trying to infiltrate his body.\n“You’re surrendering because of that?”\nChun Yeowun couldn’t believe him at all.\nIf he had the ability to manipulate and fold space, he would be able to run away alone. Instead, he decided to neutralize his own ally and then surrender?\n“I guess so. It would be hard to believe because of just that reason, but there’s\nthat\ntoo.”\n“That?”\n“Can you believe me if I do this?”\nThe 2nd Guest stepped on\nC\n, who was in the body of Hu Bong. At that moment, the bodies shook and permeated through space. It looked like he was folding the space again.\nShhh!\nIn an instant, Chun Yeowun’s form blurred, appearing in front of Hu Bong who was still in\nC\n’s naked body.\nChun Yeowun stretched out his hand towards the empty space.\nKwak!\nAt that moment, something jumped out of the empty space as Chun Yeowun was ready to grab the neck.\n“Kuak!”\nThe 2nd Guest, who was caught by the neck, looked at Chun Yeowun with a surprised look.\n‘He can control space?’\nHe didn’t seem to expect that Chun Yeowun would be able to capture him. Unfortunately, Chun Yeowun realized what he was trying to do, so he unfolded the space right in front of his hand as he understood the fundamentals of the man’s techniques.\nEven though he couldn’t imitate it perfectly, he could at least interfere with the man’s power. Chun Yeowun spoke to the man, who was still shocked,\n“What are you trying to do?”\n“I… I was…walking halfway through the realm?”\n“What?”\n“This is surprising. After that monster, I haven’t seen anyone who entered into this realm with pure martial arts in a long time.”\nChun Yeowun couldn’t make sense of what the man was saying. Frowning, he pointed to his sword at the man’s forehead and warned him,\n“It seems like you’re still dangerous, so just die.”\nHe grasped what this man could do; since Chun Yeowun knew the man’s ability, he was confident in taking him down.\nHe was planning to kill him instantly with the Supreme Sky Demon Sword, but the 2nd Guest said in an urgent voice,\n“I-I can change your subordinates body back to normal.”\nHearing those words, Chun Yeowun stopped his hand, which was about to kill the man.\n“What do you mean?”\n2nd Guest raised his hand and took off the sunglasses he wore and said,\n“Like I said. I’ll help you.”",

      "content": "Chapter 178: Change (3)\nThe face of the 2nd Guest who took off his sunglasses was completely exposed. He had kind and loving eyes in comparison to individuals who were generally thought to be tough, but even with those, he appeared strong.\nChun Yeowun, who looked at him, was a bit confused.\n‘What is this?’\nHe was definitely seeing this man for the first time. He did, however, felt a sense of familiarity. He was certain he had seen him somewhere, but couldn't remember.\n‘It is weird.’\nHe couldn’t figure out why he couldn’t remember.\n“Are you going to keep holding my neck? We don’t have much time.”\nThe 2nd Guest with red hair pointed to the hand of Chun Yeowun that was grabbing his neck.\nChun Yeowun asked.\n“Can you really turn it back to normal?”\n'Despite his strength, he is extremely vigilant.'\nThe 2nd Guest thought to himself. People who are aware of their own strength and that their opponent is weak tend to be overconfident, but Chun Yeowun never once dropped his guard.\n“Huh... I'm not good at making promises like this, but if things go wrong, cut off this man's second arm as well.”\n“Do you think it will end with one arm?”\nTak!\nChun Yeowun released the hand he was holding.\n‘He isn’t the least bit aware.’\nSome people have a hard time even speaking when their life is on the line, but this red-haired man didn’t seem to care about it.\n“Can you really undo this?”\n“The swapping of souls is an act of arbitrarily disregarding the laws of all things. It is difficult to change it, but reversing it is fine.”\nThe 2nd Guest turned his neck muscles to loosen them.\nShhh!\nThe bodies of Hu Bong and\nC\n, who had fainted, soon moved towards him.\nMun Ran-yeong asked with concern because of it,\n“Lord Chun Ma, can we trust him?”\nBecause her husband’s well-being was at stake, she couldn’t believe him. A person who should have been an enemy now wanted to be their ally, so it was understandable why she couldn’t trust him.\n“If there is any indication of anything else, I will deal with him.”\n“… I understand.”\nBecause it was Chun Ma, she couldn’t say much.\nThe two were right in front of the 2nd Guest, and then with his finger, he would move things in the air as if practicing something, like sealing things.\nChachacha!\nAfter numerous repetitions, the 2nd Guest placed his middle finger on their forehead. Then, to their surprise, something white, resembling a soul, sprang from their bodies.\nIt was similar to Ghost.\n“Soul Crossing!”\nChak! Chak!\nThe 2nd Guest chanted something loud while the changing seals on the two souls that were floating in the air, and soon they went into the opposite bodies.\n‘What is this man’s true identity?’\n‘A shaman?’\nBaekgi and Mun Ran-yeong couldn’t take their eyes off this strange phenomenon. When the soul enters the body stably and completely,\nTatak!\nThe 2nd Guest hurriedly touched the blood points of\nC\n. it was to seal her down.\nIt seemed like he was preventing her from waking up. In that state, when he made a motion, C's mouth opened.\n“Where is it? Here it is.”\nThe 2nd Guest put his finger in her mouth and carefully pulled something out. It was her molar with something like a chip attached to it.\nCrach!\nHe smashed it right away.\n“Uh.”\n“What is that?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s question, the 2nd Guest threw the broken chip and said,\n“A device which binds this old one.”\n‘Old one?’\nHe looked like he was in his 30s but the 2nd Guest called himself an old man. Of course, in this world, one couldn’t be judged by their appearance.\n“Ugh!”\nHu Bong had come to his senses. When he awoke, the first thing he did was look at himself. Even after witnessing what had occurred earlier, Chun Yeowun was still vigilant and had prepared to take him down if the soul in him was still C’s.\nHu Bong woke up and the first thing he touched was his most precious place.\n“Bong-bong!”\nMun Ran-yeong immediately yelled at him to reprimand him. However, Hu Bong’s face was filled with joy as he shouted.\n“It is there! It is right here! I am back! Lord, I am back. Hehehe!”\nHu Bong spoke like himself.\n‘He is back.’\nChun Yeowun smiled and lowered his hand. But Hu Bong cried out,\n“L-Lord. Something is strange. My whole body feels heavy and painful as if it has been tortured.”\n“…”\nChun Yeowun erased his smile and turned his gaze to the 2nd Guest. Hu Bong looked fine, but he did suffer a lot from Chun Yeowun’s hands.\nAlthough he had the ability to regenerate, the pain would stay for a bit as it was done repeatedly.\n“I kept my promise.”\nThe 2nd Guest said.\nChun Yeowun nodded and asked.\n“What was that weird thing you did and who are you?”\nHe was curious about this person’s identity.\nThis person managed to return the souls back to their original bodies with some different kind of ability.\nThe technique was weird, but it was clear that there was energy used in it, and Chun Yeowun was sure he had felt this kind of energy once before.\n“Right. Songi. Songi.1”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, the 2nd Guest’s eyes fluttered. Even those who had good martial arts couldn’t recognize this man.\nAt first, it is difficult to tell the difference.\n“You are surprising this old man again. You are definitely no ordinary person. You must have come here going against the law of causality.”\n“Causality?”\n“This isn’t the place where you belong, right? Descendant of Chun Ma.”\nPak!\n‘This man!’\nChun Yeowun reached out like lightning to bound the body of the 2nd Guest.\nWhen the space itself was entirely distorted to prevent Chun Yeowun from doing anything, the sight from all directions was messed up.\n“Lord?”\n“The front seems to be buzzing.”\nEven Chun Yeowun’s subordinates were flustered.\nNot caring about it, he asked,\n“Who are you?”\nOf course, all members of the Sky Demon Order are the descendants of the 1st Chun Ma. However, rather than saying that, this person spoke as if he was meaning to say that Chun Yeowun had completely inherited the vision of Chun Ma.\n“You have a completely different disposition from him. It is similar to when the hand went out first.”\nAs soon as the words were done, a change occurred on the 2nd Guest’s face. His facial muscles twisted and it was clearly changing shape.\nTuk!\nHis face, which had been looking young till then, had changed and aged. Now, he looked like an old man.\nChun Yeowun couldn’t help but be amazed at the appearance of this 2nd Guest who had clear eyes.\n“Elder Jeokmi!2”\n2nd Guest was surprised. The sage who was an acquaintance of the man in Kunlun Mountain, whom he saw in the images when he absorbed the yokai energy of the Golden Gumiho.\nHe remembered it because his appearance was unique. And he did think he felt familiar but didn’t imagine this to happen.\n“Huh. You know me?”\nElder Jeokmi was surprised that Chun Yeowun knew him. He revealed his identity to show that he was a sage and not a bad man, but he didn’t expect the man to know him.\n“Good Law technique.”\nThe power which Elder Jeokmi had shown so far was that.\nChun Yeowun asked in a puzzled voice.\n“How did you know?”\n“About what? About you breaking the rules and being in the world you are in now?”\n“… I guess you knew.”\nSurprisingly, Jeokmi knew that Chun Yeowun wasn’t of this time.\nThe old man smiled and said,\n“Huhuhu. I have entered the realm of all existence, how can I not know it? All humans are born with their causes and your cause is different from that here.”\n“You can see that?”\n“I see it very well. If the entire world was white, then you alone are grey.”\nThe old man said it in an easy to understand way. It was different from the leader in the Kunlun Mountains now, who wasn’t efficient in his techniques.\n‘A real sage?’\nIt made things even more mysterious.\nChun Yeowun, who’s now suspicious, asked.\n“What is a man who is a sage and uses good energy in the world hiding in a dark place and working on such plots?”\nWhen it came to the sages Chun Yeowun knew of, they were adamant on honing their way and entering the realm of truth and goodness. They would never be directly involved in the world. However, it was strange that a sage was a guest of MS Group.\n“I can understand you being skeptical, but I had no choice. In a way, it was the path I chose until I got that.”\n“That?”\nJeokmi shook his head and said to puzzled Chun Yeowun.\n“I am sorry, but there are things that this old man can’t just say. You did cross the border you shouldn’t have, but this is a thing you shouldn’t know of, yet.”\nChun Yeowun didn’t quite understand what he was talking about.\n“However, I want you to know that I, too, gave up a lot of things and bit into bitter meat in this place before embarking on a drastic plan.”\nBitter meat. It refers to a plan to get out of a difficult state even if it meant injuring the self. And the old man meant that he was sacrificing himself.\n“What are you talking about?”\n“First… Can you do something about this demonic energy?”\nHe pointed to his severed arm. The black haze was still rising over there. Normally, he would have been able to drive out any energy. However, since it was Sky Demon Energy, he couldn’t do much.\n“Hmm.”\nChun Yeowun placed his hand on the severed arm then the Sky Demon Energy trying to penetrate the body of Jeokmi had disappeared, more like scattered.\nShhh!\n“Phew. Now, I might live.”\n“Can the severed arm be attached with your techniques?”\nChun Yeowun pointed to the severed arm and asked.\nTo that, Elder Jeokmi shook his head and answered.\n“If you could help. I can do it now that the energy is gone, but I think I should leave it alone.”\n“Why would you?”\n“To avoid being doubted.”\n“… are you going to go to them?”\nThe\n‘them’\nbeing mentioned by Chun Yeowun was the MS Group. Elder Jeokmi nodded his head.\n“I still have work to do there. To be honest, I am saying this to you, but I can do nothing until that thing is in their hands.”\n“Can’t you just steal it back?”\n“I would very much like to, but even I don’t know where it is. I don’t know what power they used, but it seems like the head, the commander they call it, hid it.”\nJeokmi is a sage. If a sage, who was strong according to Chun Yeowun was being careful enough to avoid the eyes of this commander, who was he?\nChun Yeowun asked, wondering.\n“Do you know the identity of the head of MS Group? Or where is he?”\n“I don’t know. It seems like even\nC\nor\nB\nwho are known to be his longest men don’t know his identity. They, too, only receive and send the orders.”\nUnfortunately, the whereabouts of the MS Group's commander was unknown.\nChun Yeowun looked at\nC\nwho was down. At first, he wanted to search through her memory by turning her into a Ghost.\nShh!\nChun Yeowun, aiming the sword at the woman, asked,\n“Are you sure about their relationship?”\nAt that question, Elder Jeokmi answered.\n“I am an old man who follows the path of truth and goodness.”\n“I need a clear answer. I don’t care whether the person in front is a man of truth or a demon. If one gets in my way, everyone's the same.”\nAt those resolute words, Jeokmi laughed.\n‘It doesn’t seem like it, but they are so alike.’\nHe thought of it but didn’t say it out loud.\nHe lifted his left arm, which made the loose sleeve slide down.\n“That is?”\nChun Yeowun’s eyes lit up. There was something very familiar on the wrist of the left arm of the old man.\nSomething made of black iron.\nChachachak!\nAnd when he injected good energy into it, the black iron which was like a band, turned into a weapon.\n“Blade!”\nIt was a blade.\nWith black brilliance around it.\nChun Yeowun wasn’t wary of what the intentions were, but before he could think of anything, Elder Jeokmi turned the blade around and gave the grip to Chun Yeowun.\n“What?”\n“I am giving this blade to you.”\n“To me… Why?”\nCome to think of it, this man said that he followed the path of truth and goodness, but he was giving it to Chun Yeowun of the Sky Demon Order?\n“Why?”\n“It seems like this blade is written in your fate.”\n“… what do you mean by fate?”\nHe smiled at Chun Yeowun who was puzzled.\n“You will find out later. Don’t rush so much.”\n“You keep avoiding my questions. That said, I can force you to speak.”\nIf not, a way to read the memories too. Even if they were sages, they were still humans.\n“Huhuhu, that is so scary. But now, the time has come. Huh. I look forward to meeting you again.”\nJjkk!\nThe space distorted again. However, Chun Yeowun didn’t do it. It was the old man who was changing the previous distorted space to normal.\n“You think I will leave you alone?”\nChun Yeowun brought out a ferocious energy.\n“\nEik!\n”\nThe form of Elder Jeokmi had already gone into the floor, passing through it very much like Shakena passing through things.\nChun Yeowun drew his sword.\nSlash!\nAt that point, a black line appeared at the bottom, splitting the area. Chun Yeowun walked on it with force, causing the floor to break and a hole to appear.\nBang!\nWhen he moved down to see if the man had fallen on the ground, nothing could be found. No presence could be felt, most likely due to the good energy those sages utilize.\n‘Lower?’\nChun Yeowun once again did the same. And as he descended through the opening, a dark warehouse-like place with numerous boxes had appeared.\nAs he was checking the surroundings, a voice echoed in his head.\n-If you are here looking for something, then there is a high chance it is hidden down here. Well, let’s meet again!\nIt was Elder Jeokmi!\nThen he felt the space being used again. Chun Yeowun reached out his hand and moved to it, but it was too late.\nIn the end, he missed the old man.\n“Phew.”\nIt has been a long time since he missed someone this close. Irritation shot into his mind. That old man was very much a sage. He’s a being completely different from ordinary humans.\n‘Elder Jeokmi…’\nThere were still so many things he wanted to ask. He wanted to know what kind of relationship the old man had with his ancestor, Chun Ma.\nSongi means ‘good energy’.?The author changed Cheokmi to Jeokmi. Also previously translated as Cheok Mino.?",

      "content": "Chapter 179: The Record (1)\nTak! Tak!\nHu Bong descended into the pit with Baekgi, Mun Ran-yeong, and the fainted\nC\n.\n“Lord!”\n“Did you let your target escape?”\n“Yes.”\nAll three were surprised to hear that Chun Yeowun had let the man escape because he was known to never let his enemies live.\nOf course, it was ambiguous whether or not the old man actually was an enemy, but he certainly had more power than any person they met thus far.\n“Lord, what’s this blade?”\nBaekgi asked while pointing to the blade Chun Yeowun had left behind that was made of a black, iron-like metal that wasn’t from Earth. Chun Yeowun gently touched the blade with his fingertips.\nShh!\n‘I can feel the sword’s strong energy.’\nPerhaps, in order for the blade to attain its full potential, it needed to absorb and embody Good Qi, but this wasn’t the right place for that to happen.\n‘This blade seems to be trickier than the White Dragon Blade.’\nThe White Dragon Blade was Chun Yeowun’s best blade. Since it was cut off from the horns of a white dragon about to ascend to the heavens, he considered it a sacred treasure.\nHe obtained it by accident, but luck played a huge factor.\n‘I’ll check this out later.’\nShh!\nChun Yeowun opened the shadow realm and kept the blade in it.\nMun Ran-yeong and Hu Bong were familiar with the shadow realm, but Baekgi wasn’t and looked at it with curious eyes.\nChun Yeowun closed the shadow and looked around. The place was full of boxes, seemed like a warehouse, and had dust all over as if no one ever visited this place.\n‘Is something hidden in here?’\nChun Yeowun pondered the words that the old man said. Did he know what Chun Yeowun was looking for?\nHe was curious, and to resolve his curiosity, he would have to check this place out.\n‘I’m alone.’\nHe found out from the fight with the 3rd Guest that this place was wider than he had imagined. Moreover, it had several floors. However, there was something peculiar about this wide structure.\nIn terms of energy, he couldn’t feel any external presence.\n“I want to take a look around this place, so the three of you should search the other floors and find out what they were up to here.”\n“Is it fine to leave this woman here alone?”\nMun Ran-yeong asked, looking at\nC\nwith intense eyes. Since this woman had used Mun Ran-yeong’s husband's body to live, Mun Ran-yeong wouldn’t hesitate to kill\nC\n.\nSikk! Woong!\nChun Yeowun put his hand down, and three naked men with identical faces appeared.\n“Oh my!”\nMun Ran-yeong blushed at the sight, which made Hu Bong grumble.\n“Honey, turn around.”\nThe naked men were all clones of Sayogi that were Ghosts with physical bodies. They were similar to elites hidden in the shadows, as they also didn’t have identities.\n“They’ll watch over her.”\n“Yes.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, the three subordinates moved to other locations and began to search. Once they left, Chun Yeowun ordered the clones to refrain from any physical contact with C and went to inspect the warehouse.\n‘Nano, scan.’\n[Scanning.]\nChun Yeowun held out his hand as a red laser beamed out and scanned the place. Using Nano’s ability would be exponentially easier than manually searching for any clues.\nBrrr!\nChun Yeowun’s eyes trembled as augmented reality activated in his vision.\nIn augmented reality, dots moved around to show the surroundings being scanned. Inside the boxes seemed to be documents and some old technology.\n‘Why hide them here?’\nThere wasn’t anything worth hiding in here that he had found yet. All of the information was displayed by the scanning, and there were no other doors aside from the east side door, so Chun Yeowun had to think outside the box for clues.\n‘If it isn’t at the surface...’\nIt would most likely be below. Chun Yeowun put his palm on the ground.\nBeep! Beep!\nA red cross appeared in augmented reality, showing the location where numerous boxes were stacked.\nShhh!\nWhen Chun Yeowun held out his hand, the boxes were pushed aside and the floor underneath them was revealed, and initially there seemed to be no signs of anything being hidden.\nHowever, there was one sign:\n[There are traces of construction.]\nAt first glance, the floor didn’t seem different from the other floors, but Nano was able to see the differences in its texture and color. Chun Yeown grabbed a sword and drew a circle in the ground.\nTear!\nWhen the ground was cut by the Invisible Sword, the floor was pulled out along with the pillars stabilizing it.\n‘So thick.’\nThe pillar was around 5 meters in height, but the height of the opening was too small so he had to slice the pillars and then lift them up. Because the slabs he had cut were so thick, when Chun Yeowun descended he realized that something had to be down here.\n‘Should I go down now?’\nChun Yeowun pulled out a slab and entered the hole. After passing through the tunnel-like hole, a dark space appeared.\nWheik!\nWhen Chun Yeowun ignited a fire with Fire Qi, the dark space lit up, revealing a spacious environment.\n“Ahh…”\nSince the place had been blocked out for so long, there was a musty smell that filled the room.\nThere didn’t seem to be any opening for air to move, so if ordinary people came they would have had a hard time breathing.\nShh!\nChun Yeowun raised his hand, causing the wind to rise and the dust to blow in from all directions in an instant.\nIt didn’t take long for the dust that was displaced to coalesce into one huge form of pure dust and filth. Once the dust was removed, he could clearly see what was inside.\n“Machines?”\nThe entire place seemed to be filled with machines. There were many unusual mechanisms, starting with white machines with boxy square monitors and vacuum tubes with no connections.\n‘Nano, do you see the time pack?\n’\nChun Yeowun looked around as he asked Nano. Chun Yeowun knew what the time pack looked like, he couldn’t search for it all alone in this confusing area.\n[The time pack isn’t in this space.]\nNano concluded that the time pack wasn’t there. Looking at the old machines, Chun Yeowun mumbled,\n“What is all this?”\n[Cannot be determined definitely. The result of the scan shows many vacuum tubes that are connected, appearing to be some form of a supercomputer.]\nSupercomputer.\nIt was literally a computer, unlike regular ones, it was a high-level computing machine.\n‘Can you turn it on?’\nChun Yeowun asked while touching one of the tubes. The next words from Nano were very shocking.\n[As a result of analysis of the components of the computer, it is difficult to operate it now as this machine was manufactured 400 years ago,]\n‘400 years ago?’\nComputers didn’t exist 400 years ago itself. But this one was made?\n‘Nano. If the information you sent me is right, then the computers were built…’\n[The production of the first computer, known as ‘MARK-1’, was in 1944. The first super computer ENIAC, however, was produced in 1946, two years later.]\nThe information hidden here could overturn history. However, what was even more shocking was the supercomputer’s performance speed.\n[The computing speed of this device is about 8.0 teraflops.]\nA 1 teraflop processor could perform 1 trillion operations per second. The MS Group had the technology to outperform such a processor by a factor of eight 400 years prior?\nAnyone involved in academia would have been surprised at this information.\n‘Is this even possible?’\nIt was now impossible for Chun Yeowun to know the true strength of MS Group.\n[To have computing power at the teraflop level is impossible with this number of connections. In addition, several complex future technologies are part of the machine.]\nBeep! Beep! Beep!\nNano pointed out the red crosses on various machines. It was absolutely impossible to achieve such a high level of performance with such simple tubing, meaning that this was only possible with help from the distant future.\nChun Yeowun’s expression darkened. For some reason, it felt like he was getting close to something.\n‘Mu-seong company… Chun\nMu-seong\n.’\nMS Group was formerly known as Mu-seong Company.\nWhen he heard the name from Hwang-heol, he thought it was just a coincidence, but he realized it was much more than a coincidence when he arrived at this sector when he cracked the TQC code and teleported to the encrypted coordinates.\nNo matter how much he thought otherwise, there was definitely a connection between MS Group and Chun Mu-seong.\n‘What the hell happened to the supercomputer?’\nSince Nano couldn’t operate it, Chun Yeowun had no information regarding the supercomputer. Chun Mu-seong clearly informed all three of his subordinates that he would leave behind an item that would help Chun Yeowun return to the past.\nHowever, all he found was a supercomputer that he couldn’t access.\n“\nPhew\n.”\nHowever, the moment he began to feel frustrated:\nBeep!\nIn the augmented reality, which was still open, Nano signaled something on the ground. When Chun Yeowun approached it, he saw that there were several pieces of glass on the ground.\nThere were a total of 5 pieces of glass, and three were broken while two seemed intact.\n‘What is this?’\n[This is a carbon glass image storage device, known as TVM.]\n‘What?’\n[It is a video recording device developed in 2906.]\nChun Yeowun narrowed his eyes. His descendant, Chun Mu-seong, had traveled back in time from 2940. However, since this video recording device was made around that time, it was more than likely that it came from Chun Mu-seong.\n‘Nano…can you see information about this too?’\n[Yes. Since it is a semi-permanent storage device, if the TVM isn’t damaged, the media can be relayed through augmented reality.]\nAt those words, Chun Yeowun smiled. He had finally found a clue.\nHis only disappointment was that not all of the 5 glasses were fine, but he couldn’t be too sad because at least 2 of them were undamaged.\n‘Show me.’\n[Place your hand on the TVM.]\nFollowing Nano’s instructions, Chun Yeowun put his hand on one of the TVMs as a red laser flashed from his palm to scan it.\n[The TVM has many cracks, which damaged most of the footage.]\n‘What now?’\nWhen he looked closer, there were quite a few scratches, but considering that the other TVMs were broken, it was natural for something to have happened to these 2.\n[Any restorable data from the video will be played.]\nEventually, Chun Yeowun’s field of vision changed as he recognized a sight in the video.\nChik!\n‘Chun Mu-seong!’\nIt was his descendant. Unlike the first time he saw Chun Mu-seong, this time Chun Yeowun found the beard and clothes of the Murim of the past strangely unfamiliar.\nChun Mu-seong was sitting and filming himself, stroking the beard a few times before opening his mouth.\n“Video record number 421. December 9, 996. The time is 11 pm.”\nThis video was created 1083 years ago. Looking at the number 421, it seemed that the broken TVMs contained the videos he had made prior.\n“I finally helped Baekgi hibernate after he memorized the last TQC code. If this all goes well, I’m sure that Ancestor should meet them around 2079.\nChun Mu-seong was recording his daily routine like a diary. Chun Yeowun focused even further on the video.\n“One concern is that the hibernating people and their locations will probably receive some form of shock or disturbance in the future, and if something goes wrong and they end up getting hurt, then Ancestor might not receive the time pack. Sigh.”\nChun Mu-seong frowned, as if his mind was in pain. He seemed to have prepared something for Chun Yeowun, but had some doubts about whether it would actually work. He thought for a little longer and said,\n“I think I should prepare for any contingencies.”\nClick!\nThe video was cut off and the next one started playing.\n“Video record number 422. December 23, 996. Time is 8 pm. I was told that Miss Mun Ran-yeong lived a long life by taking the blood of Qilin, so I will try to replicate her longevity.”\nTak!\nChun Mu-seong held what looked like a small gourd in his hand.\n-This holds the blood of Flame Qilin. Using it should increase my life expectancy, but this refined blood is so strong that many people have died taking it. Considering its uses in the past, this is a huge risk…No, honestly I’m pretty scared.\nChun Mu-seong put down the bottle and spoke,\n“I plan to take blood on the first day of the new year. If… if I don’t make the next record, then you can consider me dead. I hope I can record more…\nlick\n!”\nThe video stopped, making Chun Yeowun wonder if the next video would play.\n[Other videos cannot be played due to the damage done to the TVM. Do you want to read the records on the other TVM device?]\n“\nPhew\n.”\nChun Yeowun sighed. Only two short records from the past had survived, so the rest would only be more unsettling.\n‘Play it.’\nHe had to confirm his thoughts. Nano finally scanned the last TVM and then,\nClick!\nChun Mu-seong appeared again, but he was different from before. Judging from the red hair, it seemed like he had managed to control the blood of Flame Qilin, but he looked like he was in his mid 50s.\n“Video record 3021. 1699. August 20th at 5 pm. The update of the supercomputer is proceeding smoothly. It’s only in teraflops, but with this level of computational power, it is likely to be able to support an AI.”\n‘AI?’\nAI stood for Artificial Intelligence.\n“If an AI can be supported, the supercomputer which I named Demon God can self-update and expedite the development of space and time movement devices.”\nClick!\nChun Mu-seung ended the video with a smile, but Chun Yeowun frowned.\n“Supercomputer Demon God?”\nThat man named the supercomputer with Chun Yeowun’s title.\nHe thought it was odd, but he managed to find the important fact through this TVM technology.\n‘He was developing a space-time movement device?’\nThe reason for creating the supercomputer was finally revealed to Chun Yeowun. Through the supercomputer, Chun Mu-seong was developing a space-time movement device to replace the time pack, but Chun Yeowun couldn’t figure out why he was creating it if the time pack was just fine.\n‘Would it be used for Hu Bong, Mun Ran-yeong, and Baekgi?’\n‘Or would it be for Chun Mu-seong to return back to his own time?’\nThe next video then played.\nClick!\nHowever, Chun Mu-seong’s face looked very exhausted. Judging by the wrinkles on his face, it seemed like even more time had passed.\n“\nCough…\nvideo record number 3087. March 15th, 1728 at 11 pm.\nCough.\nI am gradually losing weight. It seems like I’ve caught something strange, but with the medical information I currently have, it’s impossible to know for certain what’s wrong with my body.”\nBlood trickled down the corners of his lips. It was clear that the body condition was deteriorating from that alone.\n“Did the energy of the spirit blood run out? I have no way to find out.\nCough\n. I guess I should study how to heal my own body.”\nClick!\nWhen the video ended, another continued, but Chun Yeowun’s face darkened as he saw it.\nChun Mu-seong’s face was pale as if he had no blood running through him. The now dangerously skinny man opened his mouth with much difficulty.\n“Video… record… number… 3092. February 19th… 10om. I am surviving on drugs… but there seems to be a limit for it… in order for advanced development I should… haa… haa…”\nChun Mu-seong exhaled in a long and raspy manner, speaking while biting his lip.\n“For a year… I spent all my time digitally recording my brain. I don’t know if this will work, but I am trying to update the brain records into the supercomputer Demon God’s AI.”\nChun Yeowun frowned at those words.\n‘This… what does this mean?’",

      "content": "Chapter 180: The Record (2)\nChun Yeowun was at a loss for words after watching that. Since Nano transferred the knowledge of the present era, he was well versed with technical jargon and stuff.\nHowever, he still couldn’t understand what Chun Mu-seong was saying.\n‘Nano. Pause it.’\n[The video has been paused.]\nAt Chun Yeowun’s command, Nano paused it.\n‘Nano. You can understand what was being said?’\n[Yes.]\n‘… if what I understood is correct, it seems his brain has been converted into information like a computer file and is overlaid on the AI of a supercomputer… Am I right?’\n[You have understood it correctly.]\n“Ha!”\nChun Yeowun was taken aback at Nano’s answer.\nThis meant that his descendant decided to abandon his own body and transferred his mind into a computer. In a sense, it might be a way to overextend his life, but in reality, it was cloning his mind.\n‘… Phew, let's see it through first.’\n[Alright.]\nNano continued to play the video. Then, Chun Mu-seong continued to speak with difficulty again.\n-If that happens, I will become one with the supercomputer Demon God… for the development… and to continue to operate… the organization… will be… haa… haaa.\n‘Organization?’\nChun Yeowun was confused.\nIf he was right, then there was a high chance that Chun Mu-seong was running the Mu-seong Company. Or, to be more specific, it could be said that the AI copying his brain was running this organization.\n-This ends the recording of video 3092…\nChun Mu-seong, who was still speaking, had red eyes and kept on choking.\nHis face was pale, haggard, and red as he burst into tears.\nChun Mu-seong groaned as he spoke.\n-I don’t want to die… I don’t want to die. I am scared.\nIt seemed like he was afraid of being sick and dying. His eyes were clearly full of fear.\n-When I close my eyes… it is terrifying to think this… is the end… it hurts so much… haa… haa… haa… is there really anything like the afterlife? Or is it just void?\nIt seemed like he was slowly accepting reality. Even Chun Yeowun couldn’t hide the bitterness at it.\nIn a way, it was like watching his descendant who helped him, suffer like this.\n“\nHaaa\n.”\nChun Yeowun sighed. In this video, Chun Mu-seong kept repeating the words of not wanting to die. While hearing that, Chun Yeowun heard someone else's voice.\n-Commander\n-Ah?\nChun Mu-seong who was crying was taken aback and immediately ended the video.\nClick!\nThe video was not playing anymore.\n‘Nano. Are the other ones damaged?’\n[There is no next video. That was the last one.]\n‘Last?’\nThe video he watched was the last.\nThe video ended weirdly to call to it a proper end, and it wasn’t known if the descendant died, or if the AI was a success.\n“This is…”\nChun Yeowun sat down and sighed. He was unsure. The hidden time pack couldn’t be seen, and only expected information was obtained again.\n‘… Then, is the MS Group an artificial intelligence cloned from Chun Mu-seong’s brain?’\nThat was what the video said. But the more he thought, the more perplexed he became.\nIf that was true, then the cloned brain had to be of Chun Mu-seong.\nThen Jong-so came from behind?\n‘What was the real purpose?’\nIn the memory of\nD\n, one of the ten members, their goal was to create a god. But the MS Groups AI was of Chun Mu-seong, so the goal had to be of his descendant.\n‘Come to think of it, he didn’t recognize me.’\nIf the AI was Chun Mu-seong’s, then he should have recognized him. However, MS Group didn’t know Chun Yeowun at all.\nEven the executives or the voices called him with his fake name, Chun Mu-seong.\n‘There is definitely something happening.’\nConsidering this, it seemed like not everything went as planned.\n‘According to the record, it is a video of 1730. It is said that 339 years have passed since then. What the hell happened in between?’\nClearly, something was missing. Otherwise, the MS Group wouldn’t lose their initial purpose and do such bizarre things as creating a god.\n‘Sigh.’\nThere was no point worrying further. If this was the case, the only way to know is to meet the head of MS Group.\nShh!\nChun Yeowun put the TVM into the shadows. Then heard Hu Bong’s voice in his mind.\n-Lord. I discovered some strange machines here, all of which exploded and broke.\n“What?”\n-Uh? This is?\nFollowing it were Mun Ran-yeong’s words in his head.\n-Bong-bong, I’ll tell the Lord. My Lord. The monitor screen here is saying… Omission of Report… Suicide Sequence… in English.\nIt was written in English, so Hu Bong couldn’t understand it. Mun Ran-yeong normally shouldn’t have known it but she learned it when she was acting like a secretary.\nUpon hearing that, Chun Yeowun’s expression hardened.\n“Omission of report? Suicide sequence?”\n‘What was this?’\nKwang!\nAt that moment, a loud roar and a strong heatwave were felt from above. It was an explosion. There wasn’t even time to stop it.\n“\nTch\n!”\nShh!\nChun Yeowun moved through the place. As he appeared at the point of the explosion taking place.\nIn the midst were Baekgi, Hu Bong and Mun Ran-yeong.\n“Lord!”\nThey all shouted when they saw Chun Yeowun. However, because of the explosion, it couldn’t be heard.\nShh! Woong!\nWhen Chun Yeowun waved his hand, a strong wind pressure created a vacuum that could withstand the heat and flames. Thanks to that, the three of them were able to escape from there.\n“Ah?”\n“Stay close to me.”\n“Y-yes!”\nWoong!\nWhen Chun Yeowun raised the Ghost Qi from the wrist guard on the right hand, the Ghost of\nE\ncame out.\n‘To Yongchun Group!’\nUpon receiving the command, the Ghost spread the arms open. Then the three people along with Chun Yeowun were sucked into space.\nAt the same time, the vacuum was released too, and the place exploded as Chun Yeowun released the grip.\nKwaang!\nSame time.\nAt Yongchun Group’s senior management meeting room.\nChun Woo-jin, Chun Yu-jang, and the other executives were all in the meeting room and couldn’t hide their shock at the four people who suddenly appeared there.\nChhik!\nSteam was rising from the bodies of Baekgi, Hu Bong, and Mun Ran-yeong.\nHu Bong murmured as he rubbed his slightly scorched hair.\n“Phew. I almost turned bald again.”\nHu Bong, who now had long hair, had been bald before due to an unfortunate accident.\nSeeing the three of them like this, Chun Yu-jang asked.\n“W-what happened? Ancestor.”\nChun Yeowun answered with an annoyed expression.\n“A troublesome thing.”\nHe couldn’t bring back\nC\nfrom there due to the explosion and he lost 3 precious clones of Sayogi.\nAt that moment, there was no other choice. If Chun Yeowun had been a little late, the three of them would have suffered injuries.\nA space filled with machines.\nThe heart of the machines were numerous monitors and the screen was filled with 0s and 1s.\nSomething was engraved on it.\n-Disappearance of The First. (Lost Start)\nAmong them were a few English letters on the largest screen.\n-No more time...\n-Activate the process of making God.\n“Lord Chun Ma.”\nBi Mak-heon came to Chun Yeowun with a smartphone.\n“Who?”\nChun Yeowun was a bit pissed because things didn’t get go his way, so Bi Mak-heon cautiously said,\n“Your disciple.”\n“Ha!”\nThe disciple was Ark Young.\nHe was the one who had forgotten that he said to Ark Young that he would pick him but then he went to get the time pack.\n‘Disciple?’\nThe room was then filled with whispers.\nHearing Bi Mak-heon’s words, the executives all were shocked. Because this disciple was of Chun Yeowun’s!\nNot caring about them, Chun Yeowun answered the phone.\n“Ark Young.”\n-Teacher!\n“Have you arrived at lake Baikal?”\nBefore going for the time pack, Chun Yeowun asked Ark Young to go to Lake Baikal. Lake Baikal was a southeast city that wasn’t far from where Ark Young was stuck.\nHowever, Ark Young’s reaction was off.\n-Teacher… Uhm, there is a huge problem over here.\n“Problem?”\n-I really feel like you should come to see this for yourself.\nA loud noise was coming up. It almost sounded like something was burning.\n‘What?’\nSame time.\nNear the west of Lake Baikal in Russia.\nArk Young’s body, holding the smartphone, was shimmering in red lights. The reason he was surrounded in bright red light even in the middle of the night was simple.\nBubble!\nIt was because the place Ark Young was looking at was full of lava where there should have been a blue lake instead.\n“Huh, how do I say…”\nIn the middle of this lava-filled lake, there had to be Olkhon Island, the sacred site of the North Sea Ice Palace which Chun Yeowun talked about.\nHowever, this place was so hot that it was impossible to even get near the lake.",

      "content": "Chapter 181: North Sea Ice Palace (1)\nRussia was a land with a largely cold atmosphere.\nIt was also where the North Sea Ice Palace, which was known to be a strong clan, was located.\nThere were many theories that the snowy field of the North Sea and the North Sea Ice Palace was located on Olkhon island.\nOriginally, there was an indigenous clan living on the island, but the clan came under control of the North Sea Ice Palace when the Sky Demon Order went to help them a thousand years back.\nThe North Sea Ice Palace had sent out a group to explore other lands and spread word of their reputation, but this caused the North Sea Ice Palace, which was originally just one group, to later be split into two groups with different views and beliefs.\nMore than a thousand years had passed since then, and this outsider group that was split off was now located at the southern end of Olkhon island.\nThe outsiders had originally intended to return to the original clan when they left, but they weren’t able to head to the northern tip of the island and had to settle in the southern tip.\nCurrently, they kept experiencing worse and worse confrontations.\n“Hmm.”\nThe building located in the center of the southern tip of Olkhon island was the residence of Dan Cho-jin, one of the leaders of the Sky Demon Order and the head of the North Sea Ice clan.\nDan Cho-jin had silver hair and a beard, and although he looked like he was in his mid 40’s, he was actually 85 years old.\nBody reconstruction allowed him to maintain youth in appearance and movement.\n“Huh? Didn’t I say no?”\nDan Cho-jin spoke as if it was repulsed by a silver-haired man who seemed to be in his mid 30’s and a beautiful woman with curly silver hair who seemed to be in his 20’s.\nThey were Dan Cho-jin’s son Dan Cho-ja and granddaughter Dan So-yeong.\nDan Cho-ja frowned and opened his mouth,\n“Father, you need to make a decision.”\n“What decision?”\n“They are already on a completely different path from ours.”\n“Stop saying that.”\nDan Cho-jin strongly rebuked his child, prompting his grand-daughter to speak up,\n“Grandfather, what my father is saying is correct. No matter how much the North Sea Ice Palace shares its roots with us, how can we move under the Ministry of Defense of Russia?! That should never happen!”\n“Ugh, you people!”\nDan Cho-jin glared at his son and granddaughter.\nHow could people from three different generations have such a serious confrontation? The cause of their argument was the agreement of two factions that had been divided for a thousand years.\n“Then, are you saying that we shouldn’t settle in our hometown and leave again?”\nHearing Da Cho-jin’s words, Dan Cho-ja spoke firmly,\n“Yes, it’ll be better that way! According to the news we’ve heard, there are signs of the Sky Demon Order reviving again in China!”\n“Again with that nonsense!”\n“How can you say that when this could be a fated reunion? Why are you being so skeptical, unless you’re adamant about trying to enter Russia?”\nInitially, the North Sea Ice clan was an outsider Murim clan that migrated from China.\nHowever, their location within Russia was far above Mongolia, and as a result, their Russian neighbors reached out to them. It seemed like the North Sea Ice Palace had already entered into a treaty with Russia's defense.\nDan So-young spoke,\n“Grandfather, I want to return to China just like what my father said.”\n“You’re exactly like your father. This is my domain! How dare you people say that I abandon this place and the blood I shed here to return to the Sky Demon Order that we supported a thousand years back? In addition, that clan has collapsed! No matter how much they try to resurrect, do you think that China will sit silently while they try to revive again?”\nDan Cho-jin’s cheeks trembled in anger.\nIf they weren't his son and granddaughter, he would have gotten his hands involved by now.\n“I won’t say any more! I am the leader, and my decision will not be overturned unless I die!”\n“Sigh.”\n“Go!”\n“...Alright.”\nBecause of Dan Cho-jin’s adamant response, they got up to leave. Dan Cho-ja, who left first, smoked a cigarette and stood outside without a word while his daughter followed shortly.\n“Father, cheer up.”\nLooking at her supportive side, he put on a bitter smile.\n“Thank you. However, you don’t have to do this and end up being scolded by your grandfather.”\n“Well, what’s wrong is wrong. No matter how much we say that North Sea Ice Palace has our roots, our roots are actually in China.”\n“I don’t know how to get this point into his head.”\nThey were the outside group that had left to tell people about the North Sea Ice clan, but when they came back and settled south of Olkhon island, they were always at odds.\nAll of the fighting came from internal conflicts. The North Sea Ice Palace that had sent the people out slowly became wary that, when the group returned, it would start to influence the power of the clan, so the North Sea Ice Palace forbade them from entering the palace. Despite the wrongfulness of the North Sea Ice Palace’s treatment, Dan Cho-jin had always waited for them to accept the North Sea Ice clan back once more.\n“I think what Father is doing is right. Even though Grandfather conceded by handing over the divine item to them, they still demand more things from us.”\nThe requirements of the insiders were increasing each time; as if giving up the divine staff wasn’t enough, they wanted the clan head’s absolute loyalty to the Russian government.\n“And I wonder if our roots here will be forgotten.”\nFor over a thousand years, they lived as members of the Sky Demon Order but didn’t know much about the clan. However, it was no exaggeration to think that the Sky Demon order would act the same as the North Sea Ice Palace.\n“Right. You’re right.”\nHe stroked his daughter’s hair to ease her thoughts. Dan So-young said to him playfully,\n“Don’t touch my hair with that hand, it reeks of cigarettes.”\n“Ah, sorry.”\nDan Cho-ja released his hand and looked at the setting sun.\nAnd since they were on an island, the environment was often covered with fog, but today it was thicker than usual and the entire atmosphere was imbued with a scarlet hue.\n“I don’t feel too good about it, but I’ll have to convince my father again tomorrow. On the other hand, when will the power line be restored?”\n“Well, it’s been 5 days already. It was fine at first, but the fact that I can’t watch TV or use the internet makes me so uncomfortable.”\nAll the power inside the island was cut off because of a problem with the wiring around the lake.\nThis was the 5th day of the power outage, and it began to feel like they were living like savages. Living wasn’t too bad, but since the power line was cut off, no information was being sent in about the rest of the world.\n“Let’s head in first. It’ll get cold once the sun sets.”\nDan So-young puzzled at those words, asked,\n“But Father, isn't it a bit too warm today?”\nAs if he didn’t notice it, he tilted his head. The weather was indeed warmer than he had expected.\nRussia at this hour would usually be cold enough for people to freeze to death, but that same level of coldness wasn’t present at all.\n“That’s true. Maybe the weather’s changed.”\nMost of the time, the seasons were very discrete, but at some point, spring and autumn had gradually disappeared.\nIn most regions, there was only summer and winter. Dan Cho-ja grew up in China, which was a warmer area than here, and didn’t think it was of any concern and went in.\n“Hm.”\nDan So-young thought something was off. The fog was thicker than usual and the warmth in the evening was something she couldn’t understand.\n“If only the phones were working, I would be able to figure out what’s going on.\nShe glanced at the flexible smartphone on her wrist. It had been powered off for so long because the charge had drained.\n“\nPhew\n. Am I being overly sensitive?”\nShe shook her head and went in after her father. A few hours later, the power was still out and she couldn’t think about what to do as the surroundings still felt stuffy.\n‘Why is it so hot?’\nIt was difficult to concentrate on training because it was way too hot now. Just then, someone came in and shouted,\n“Leader! Leader, come out and see this! We’re in a huge mess!”\nHearing that, she stopped her training and ran outside. Her father was already outside, still unable to understand why the heat was higher outside than inside.\n“Father!”\n“So-young!”\n“What is this?”\n“I don’t know either.”\nThere weren’t any signs of fires spreading, so what was the cause of this heat?\nThen, one of the clan members came to Dan Cho-ja and said,\n“Young leader, we are in trouble! There’s a problem on one side of the lake.”\n“A problem?”\nThe lake wasn’t visible to them as their clan, which was like a village, was located in a lowland in the southwestern tip of the island.\nBoth father and daughter hurried towards the pointed tip, and as they got closer, they could see a hazy mist and red ground – very ominous signs.\nWhen they arrived near the lake, they were shocked.\n“W-what is this?”\nThe lake was blazing red, and the liquid was too thick to be considered water. Both the father and daughter had to cover themselves with energy to stop the heat from burning their skin.\nWong!\n“Father, could this be lava?”\nDan Cho-ja couldn’t answer her. The lake around the island was undeniably full of lava and not a single person had noticed it until now?\nThis wasn’t something that could have happened naturally.\n“Father… this.. is…”\nDan cho-ja bit his lip.\n“Gate!”\nRight, this phenomenon was possible only if Gate opened.\nThere were three types of Gate entities. Individual, Disaster and Special.\nThis seemed similar to a natural disaster, so it was probably a Disaster type. Dan Cho-ja mumbled,\n“How could this happen right when the power lines were cut off?”\nThe Gate seemed to open during the only time when they couldn’t alarm others. This was definitely a complicated situation to be involved in.\n“And for us to know this only now!”\nIf this was happening someone should have noticed it, but no one had. One member of the clan yelled,\n“Young leader, over here!”\nWhen he moved there, Dan Cho-ja was horrified at the scene.\nThere were three bodies, and they were all clan people.\nThey had died with sharp wounds all over their bodies, as if someone had killed them.\n“This is the Ice and Snow Sword technique!”\nThe sword marks on the body were undoubtedly from the Ice and Snow Sword technique, a technique that the North Sea Ice Palace used.\nThe Ice and Snow Sword technique was taught by either North Sea Ice Clan or the warriors of the North Sea Ice Palace.\nDying with such scars meant only one thing.\n“Father… this is a trap!”\nDan So-young said in a trembling voice.\nDan Cho-jin, the leader of the North Sea Ice clan, was looking at the lava-filled lake with bewildered eyes along with the clan members.\nThe heat from the lava felt like it would burnt everything.\n“How could this–”\nThe lava was slowly moving into the island. Over time, the entire land would eventually be submerged.\n“Leader. We need to head deeper into the island as we could be hurt by the heat if we stay here.”\nThe heat could be avoided with internal energy, but withstanding the lava directly was a different matter altogether. Since this wasn’t a natural occurrence and likely involved a Gate, they couldn’t linger in the area any longer.\n“Haa!”\nGoo!\nDan Cho-jin raised his power and exerted a cold energy.\nHe then reached out to the place where the lava was flowing.\nJjkkk!\nA long and huge ice wall about 5 meters wide was created to block the lava.\n“Oh!”\n“It’s been stopped!”\nThe members of the clan marveled at the sight. To create an ice wall of this size wasn’t possible for just anyone.\nEveryone was shocked and thought they could survive the disaster when,\nJjkkk\n!\nA strange sound from the wall, which turned red as it melted it away quickly.\n“No way.”\n“It’s melting!”\nUnfortunately, even the ice wall was taken down as it was unable to withstand the heat. All the clan’s hope turned into despair in just a second.\n“Ugh!”\nDan Cho-jin looked at the melting ice wall as a strange feeling flowed inside him.\nIf this situation wasn’t prevented, the entire island would go down as this lava burned everyone to their death. The only ones who could move through air were him and Dan Cho-ja, but he couldn’t leave the clan members and run away.\n‘If my strength isn’t enough, I’ll just need to join forces with others.’\nDan Cho-jin decided that he could overcome the heat of the lake if he worked with others. He decided to get help from the North Sea Ice Palace and try using the cold energy to create a path out of here.\n“Let’s get help from the Ice Palace for now.”\nThe crisis called for the North Sea Ice clan and the North Sea Ice Palace to join forces, which could help them unify once more in the future. Then, someone ran over.\n“Father!”\nThey were his son and granddaughter. Dan Cho-jin sighed in relief as he saw them safe and unharmed.\n“You’re fine.”\nAnd as he confirmed what they said, Dan Cho-jin said,\n“We don’t have time for this, the lava is flowing in quickly so let’s hurry and go to the North Sea Ice palace.”\nHearing that, Dan Cho-ja held up his hand and said,\n“There is no need for that, and no need for those people here.”\n“What are you saying?”\n“Father, this is a trap.”\n“What are you saying? Tell me in a way that will help me understand what’s happening.”\nDan So-young answered to his shouting,\n“Grandfather, all the members of the clan near the pier and lake were killed.”\n“W-what?”\nDan Cho-jin couldn’t hide his shock at those words. Even if that wasn’t the conclusion he had in mind, he not only wondered how such a thing had occurred but also how no one knew they were missing.\n“Grandfather, you know how the power line was out 5 days ago?”\n“Yes, of course.”\n“Because of that, we didn’t even know about the Gate warning. Out there, the members who were guarding the lake and pier were killed. What do you think this means? This is all a trap by those Ice Palace bastards!”\n‘!!!’\nDan Cho-jin was at a loss of words, likely shocked at how certain she sounded.\nHe always thought of the Ice Palace as his compatriots from the same bloodline, but since the evidence pointed at the Ice Palace as the perpetrators, he was immensely disappointed.\n“How can this… no, it can’t be that.”\nNormally, it would be easy to take this in by others but this was not the case for Dan Cho-jin, who trusted the Ice Palace.\nIt made no sense of him that they would kill their own people just because they were now in different factions.\n“Father! All the members killed had signs of the Ice and Snow Sword technique. You need to accept this now!”\nDan Cho-jin continued denial made Dan Cho-ja yell, but nevertheless, Dan Cho-jin shook his head and said,\n“No, it can’t be that. I will go and see the truth with my own two eyes!”\n“Grandfather.”\n“What are you talking about?! The lava is rushing and you want to go check that place now?”\nThe lava was flowing in quickly, and it now seemed like the entire path would be cut off. At that instant, the members of the clan shouted,\n“Leader, the lava is reaching us! We can’t stay here any longer!”\nAll of a sudden, the lava was dangerously close to their location because even though they were all trying to hold it off, nothing seemed to work.\nMeanwhile, out of stubbornness, Dan Cho-jin said,\n“If you won’t come, then don't come, I will go there myself.”\nBoth the father and daughter were perplexed by his attitude. They then heard,\n“Who is the leader of the North Sea Ice clan?”\n‘!?’\nEveryone looked at the source of the unfamiliar voice.\n“And you are?”\nUntil now, there had only been members of the clan present, but a stranger with a black suit and white face suddenly appeared.\nOf course, it was none other than Chun Yeowun.\nSrng!\n“Who are you?”\n“How did you come here?”\nBoth father and daughter pulled out their swords and aimed them at Chun Yeowun, showing their Murim instinct.\nTheir faces were stained with tension because someone was able to come this close to them without being sensed.\nThen, Chun Yeowun spoke with a smirk,\n“You’re dogs who don’t even know your master.”\n“What?”\n“Before anything happens…”\nChun Yeowun raised his hand upwards.\nWoong!\nAt that moment, something strange happened in the sky. Countless Ice Swords were scattered in all directions while filled with heat. The members of the North Sea Ice clan were shocked at the sight.\n“T-that sword?”\n“What is this?”\nChun Yeowun waved his hand towards the lava, causing the Ice Swords dyed in blue light directly hit the flowing lava,\nKwakwang!",

      "content": "Chapter 182: North Sea Ice Palace (2)\nA meteor shower in the misty night sky.\n“T-this makes no sense.”\n“All of them have sword energy on them?”\nThe members of the North Sea Ice Clan were shocked at this. At first glance, they seemed to be ice swords, but then they had sword energy on them.\nBesides, the way they were all arranged looked like…\n“Is this… Air Swords?”\nDan Cho-ja, the young leader of the North Sea Ice Clan, opened his mouth in shock. He had heard that even a Divine Master could not wield so many swords because it requires a lot of mental strength and internal energy.\nBut this was beyond common sense.\n“How… how can this….”\n‘Father?’\nDan Cho-ja consciously looked at the puzzled Dan Cho-jin. Naturally, Dan Cho-jin was taken aback, but there was more to it.\n“Sky Flash…”\nThose two letters came up. The moment he heard those words, Dan Cho-ja too was shocked.\n“The Sky Flash!”\nIt was impossible to be unaware of this technique as the leader of the North Sea Ice Clan, who had served for generations under the Lord of the Sky Demon Order.\nSky Flash.\nThe absolute power of the Demon God.\nWhen those words were heard, people thought it was an exaggerated story. How can one person handle all of these swords, no matter how rational a person is?\n“… it is true.”\nThe rumors weren’t an exaggeration. Instead, seeing it in person confirmed it.\nKwakwakwang!\nThe swords kept hitting the lava without stopping. However, if they looked closely, it wasn’t the lava being hit by the swords. They were aiming for the immediate vicinity of lava.\nKwakwakwang!\n[70% complete. The entry path of lava flows into depression.]\nThis was all being done by a thorough analysis of Nano.\nEven if it was Sky Flash, it could not handle the lava. So they were digging a drainage trench to keep the lava from pouring onto the land.\n“Over there! The lava is flowing down!”\nThere was hope on the faces of the clan members, who were shocked. However, the lava couldn’t be calmed with a simple depression inland.\nWoong!\nSince the lava was thick and sluggish, its movement was only slow.\n“Even that can’t stop it?”\n“T-the amount of lava is too much.”\nTo handle all that much lava, it appeared that a few kilometers of canals would need digging.\nChun Yeowun said to Dan Cho-ja and his daughter, who were levelling their swords at him at the time,\n“Move out of my way.”\nEven though they were the first to draw their swords, they immediately stood aside.\n“Y-yes!”\nDan So-young backed away too. As they moved, Chun Yeowun approached where she had previously stood and used Sky Flash.\nKwakwakwang!\nThe Air Swords kept falling. The lava flowed, sinking into the draining path.\nNot everyone knew what was happening.\nIt was then…\nKwang!\nChun Yeowun stepped forward vigorously on the ground, and then came the highlight.\nKukukuku!\nThe ground shook like an earthquake starting from where he stepped on. Then the floor swelled up and immediately sunk in.\n“Ooh!”\n“T-the ground!”\nThe ground around rose 10 meters as if there was a barrier. It was because of the Earth Qi: one of the five attributes of the Spirit Beasts.\n“This much should be enough.”\nKwang!\nNot stopping there, Chun Yeowun once again stepped forward on the ground. Then starting with him, the land began to freeze for several hundred meters.\nJjjkkk!\n“T-the ground is freezing!”\n“Unbelievable!”\nThe clan members were all shocked at what they had witnessed. They, too, know how to deal with cold energy, but it was their first time seeing someone freeze a land for hundreds of meters.\nChik!\nThe place overflowed with steam as the heat of the lava cooled down.\nAs the hot air caused by the lava began to cool, the clan members felt they might have a chance to live longer.\nDan So-young spoke to her father, who was still in disbelief.\n“Father… that man… is he that one?”\nThe man didn’t block the lava entirely. However, it was no exaggeration to say that this is the safest area from the lava. No human could prevent such a disaster.\nAt that moment, Dan Cho-jin screamed.\n“What is that way you are speaking!”\n“Uh?”\n“That man is God!”\nShe looked at her grandfather with a look of disbelief and absurdity.\nShe wondered what was wrong with her grandfather, who looked like he would cry any moment from the emotions overflowing within him.\n‘What is with him?’\nShe was flustered and confused. So she tried asking her father when,\n“Fath…!?”\nHe kept mumbling something as if he had lost his mind while looking at Chun Yeowun.\n“The legend… it was true, the legend was true!”\nHis voice is full of emotions.\n“Legend?”\nDan Cho-ja turned to the puzzled Dan So-young and spoke in happiness.\n“So-young. For real, he is back.”\n“Huh? He?”\n“The Demon God has come back!”\nThere were only three great elders in the Sky Demon Order.\nAmong them, only two of them managed to help and look after their clan as the third one, Mun Ran-yeong, had gone into slumber.\nThey were the Martial Dual Sword clan and the North Sea Ice Clan. They both had a legend passed down orally for thousands of years.\nA legend that the seer, Seong Mu-chun, prophesied that the Demon God, Chun Yeowun, would return to the distant future.\n“What?! What are you all doing?! The Demon God! No - Chun Ma has descended. Greet him!”\nWhisper.\nAt the cry of Dan Cho-jin, all the clan members bowed their heads by falling onto the ground at once.\nThey, too, were members of Sky Demon Order, so there was no way they didn’t know what Chun Ma meant.\nThud!\n“The clan members of the Great Sky Demon Order greet the Demon God Chun Ma!”\nDan Cho-jin banged his head on the floor as he shouted it. Seeing that, Dan So-young bit back her tongue.\nJust a few hours ago, this man acted like he wanted to do nothing with the collapsed Sky Demon order, but now he was acting like this.\n‘Sigh.’\nShe knew it for a long time, but this proved once again that her grandfather was a na?ve man. In any case, since both her grandfather and father bowed, she too had to bow.\n‘… that person is the Demon God?’\nA name mentioned countless times in the Sky Demon Order.\nChun Yeowun, the 24th Lord of the Sky Demon Order. The second person to have the title of Chun Ma since the first one and was said to have achieved an unprecedented name for the cult since its founding.\n‘He doesn't seem to have much of an age difference from me.’\nOn the outside, Chun Yeowun looked to be in his early 20s, not much older than her. Still, he seemed too powerful.\n‘Is that true? no matter how great the internal energy is, can humans live more than a thousand years?’\nShe’s currently 29 years old. She was only 2 years old when the Sky Demon Order was dissolved.\nUnlike her father and grandfather, she didn’t learn the morals and teachings of the Sky Demon Order, so her mind was filled with doubts.\nThat was when Chun Yeowun spoke.\n“I can feel the energy of the Cold Ice from Heaven cultivation from you two.”\nThey were Dan Cho-jin and Dan Cho-ja.\nEver since he hit the Divine Master level, Chun Yeowun was able to distinguish between energy and qi.\n“You.”\nChun Yeowun said, looking at Dan Cho-jin.\nDespite the arrogant tone, Dan Cho-jin didn’t talk back and raised his head as he answered in an emotion-filled voice.\n“T-this.. Yes, Lord Chun Ma.”\n“Even if it is stopped, for now, it will only hold on so long.”\n“Ah…”\nThe lake of lava. Even if he blocked the area, it was only a matter of time for the lava to enter once again.\nChun Yeowun continued.\n“We don’t have the luxury of time. Gather all the clan members here.”\n“Huh?”\n“Didn’t hear me? I said to gather all of them.”\nDan Cho-jin couldn’t understand when Chun Yeowun said to gather all of them. At that, Dan Cho-ja pointed to the nearby members.\n“Lord Chun Ma. These are all our sect members.”\n“The ones here?”\nThe people bowing on the ground didn’t seem like more than three hundred. Considering that 100 of them followed him to China in the past, the number did go up.\nBut Chun Yeowun meant something else.\n“Then what are the ones coming from there?”\n“Huh? The ones coming?”\nThe place Chun Yeowun pointed to was in the northeast direction.\nThese people didn’t try to sense the energy because of the panic they were in, but Chun Yeowun wasn’t the kind to be swayed by the flow.\n“Ah!”\nSome people were coming here. He tried to use his heightened vision.\n‘Foreigner?’\nChun Yeowun’s eyes narrowed. It's a bit like east and west, unlike the ones from here. The clan members spoke in a hurry.\n“Lord. They seem to be from the North Sea Ice Palace.”\nAt that, Chun Yeowun’s eyes lit up.\n‘People from North Sea Ice Palace?’\nIn the past, they had a strangely exotic feeling like the ones living in the north, but now they seemed full-on foreigners.\n“Look. Wasn’t this old man right? How can they forsake us!”\nDan Cho-jin said to his son next to him with a bright voice.\nHe believed that the North Sea Ice Palace would never betray them. At that, Dan Cho-ja sighed and mumbled.\n“Haa… Father.”\nYou are trusting those people till the very end.",

      "content": "Chapter 183: North Sea Ice Palace (3)\nTatata!\nUnder the leader’s orders, the 3rd Elder of the North Sea Ice Palace was moving to the location of the North Sea Ice clan using Light Footwork along with 6 other escorts. However, their facial expressions showed mixed feelings…\n‘What is all this?’\nHa Jong-oh, the 3rd Elder of the North Sea Ice Palace, couldn’t understand the situation that was unfolding. At the moment, the entire Olkhon island was threatened by the lava to the point that it looked like a sea of fire, but the destination was frozen as if it hadn’t been touched by the heat.\n“Elder, this is strange.”\n“This is much different from what we expected.”\nThey were expecting the North Sea Ice clan to be desperate for help from the lava, and thus were rightfully puzzled when they saw that the land was frozen a hundred meters away from the nearest side of the lake, as if the lava that should have been flowing in was blocked by something.\n“Did their leader do this?”\n“No way. Unless there were dozens of people at his level, they never could have frozen such a wide area.”\nHa Jong-oh intervened the escorts’ conversation with a calm voice,\n“It doesn’t matter. No matter how long they try, what can they do to get out of there? Under the command of the Royal Court, I will ensure their end today.”\nIt didn’t matter if the location was frozen: as long as the lava was still flowing, everything would slowly melt away.\nTak!\nThey finally arrived where the clan was gathered.\n‘What’s happening?’\n3rd Elder Ha Jong-oh frowned. He didn’t realize it initially, but the North Sea Ice clan members seemed to be bowing to someone.\nIn the direction they faced, only one man was standing.\nHo Jong-oh looked at Dan Cho-jin’s bowing and asked,\n“Lord Dan, what are you doing right now?”\nHearing the question, Dan Cho-jin raised his head and asked for Chun Yeowun’s permission to respond.\n“Lord Chun Ma, please excuse me for a moment.”\nHe then urged the 3rd Elder,\n“Elder Ha, bow your head.”\nThe 3rd Elder was beyond flustered at this point and raised his voice,\n“What are you trying to say?! Why would an Elder such as I bow to this man?!”\n“Huh?! How can you use such disrespectful words towards the Chun Ma of the Sky Demon Order!”\nNo matter how great the North Sea Ice Palace was, Dan Cho-jin insisted that the elder refrain from disrespecting the Chun Ma.\nHearing the title “Chun Ma”, Ha Jong-oh turned his head and looked at Chun Yeowun.\n“Chun Ma? Are you talking about the Sky Demon Order’s Chun Ma?”\n“Right. Hurry up and–”\nBefore Dan Cho-jin could even finish talking, Ha Jong-oh suddenly burst into laughter.\n“Hahahahaha!”\nHearing the elder’s response, Dan Cho-jin’s face went stiff as he asked,\n“Why are you laughing?”\n“What, don’t you think this is funny? It is absurd to me. What are you upto by bowing down to a fallen clan? It is just so funny hahaha.”\nAs if sympathizing, the other escorts too laughed along. Dan Cho-jin was happy they came but he couldn’t control his anger at their insulting actions.\n“How dare you!”\nIt was then.\nWoong!\n“\nUhk\n!”\nHa Jong-oh, who was laughing, suddenly began to float in the air. Out of shock, he tried to raise his internal energy and tried to fight against the energy holding him up, but his body then flew as if the thread holding him to the ground was cut and he was being thrown into the air.\nGrab!\n“\nKuak\n!”\nChun Yeowun, obviously the one moving Ha Jong-Oh as if he were a child’s toy, spoke in his usual cold manner,\n“You’re talking shit with that dirty mouth of yours. You call us a fallen clan?”\n“\nKuak\n!\nKuak\n!”\nHa Jong-oh tried to make Chun Yeowun release the grasp, but no matter how hard he tried, his internal energy didn’t work and he couldn’t move.\n‘\nW-what is he?’\nThe 3rd Elder of the North Sea Ice Palace was known to be the strongest warrior of the North Sea Ice Palace, and he was rightfully shocked that someone who looked like a young man was able to control him.\n“Do you think you have two lives?”\nGrab!\n“\nKuak\n!”\nHa Jong-oh, who continued to suffocate, grunted in pain as Chun Yeowun tightened the grasp on him.\n“How dare you!”\n“Release the Elder now!”\nShhh!\nTo protect Ha Jong-oh, the 6 escorts drew out their swords at the same time but were blocked by Dan Cho-ja.\n“Those swords… if you pull those out, you won’t make it out alive!”\nHearing the threatening warning, the oldest of the escorts shouted in anger.\n“You dogs are all crazy! The King is showing mercy because, despite being hybrids, you have the same blood of the North Sea Ice Palace. However, if you hurt the eld–”\nShh!\nA freezing chill spread around, and the shouting escort was so started he didn’t speak any further and just peered at the coldness.\nThe freezing atmosphere came from Dan Cho-jin.\n“What are you saying? Dogs? Mercy?”\nDogs and hybrids were words that the Palace used to demean the “outsider” group. Dan Cho-jin couldn’t contain his anger any longer.\n‘These bastards!’\nHe wanted to kill the subordinate to the Palace right away but decided against it because they shared the same blood as him.\nFlinch!\nThe escort was already exhausted from the coldness spreading and said in a low voice,\n“You think you can do this? We… we are giving you one last chance.”\n“Chance?”\nDan Cho-ja thought everything they were saying was absurd. The fact that these people, the culprits, were the ones giving a chance was absurd.\n“You bastards!”\n“A chance, you say?”\nThe North Sea Ice clan members looked at the escort with enraged eyes. In response to the horrendous energy, the escort hurriedly spoke,\n“\nUgh\n! Do you all want to be swept away by the lava and burn to death?”\n“Do all of you people speak like this?”\nDan So-young then got up and pulled out her sheath. The palace escort, feeling a sense of crisis, hurriedly shouted,\n“There is an undersea tunnel to the North Sea Ice Palace!”\n“Tunnel?”\n“Exactly! The king of the palace said that if you accept the proposal sent by the palace, he will open the tunnel out of hismercy and generosity.”\n“Seriously, you people!”\nSrng!\nDan So-young, unable to contain her anger, pulled the sword out and tried to stab the escort, prompting Dan Cho-ja to stop her.\n“Father!”\n“Pull back your sword.”\n“What do you mean?! Are you going to ignore what these bastards just said? If we accept their proposal, the generations of our family will be meaningless because we’ll need to destroy our dantians and we swear our allegiance to them. Were you even listening to what he said?”\nRight. This was the reason the father and daughter were trying to oppose the proposal until the end. The requirement to enter into the North Sea Ice Palace was to destroy their own dantian, which was formed by their own Cold Ice cultivation technique.\nDidn’t that mean that the palace wanted only\ntheir\npeople to live and flourish as Murim warriors?\nGrunt!\nDan Cho-ja grunted. Like his daughter, he was unable to hold back the anger.\nHowever, there was no other way to save the clan members around him.\n‘Even if he is Chun Ma, he can’t save all of us in this situation.’\nThis was why he stopped her; if he was going to be a leader, he had to prioritize the people below him.\nDan Cho-jin, too, held back his anger when he heard the word ‘tunnel’. The 3rd Elder, who was caught by Chun Yeowun, struggled to open his mouth,\n“\nKuak\n, d-did you hear what I said? If you want to live, let go of me and apologize—”\nIt was then.\nGrab!\n“Uh?”\nChun Yeowun grabbed his chin.\n“W-what are you doing—.”\nBefore the escort could even finish asking, Chun Yeowun poured more strength into his hand.\nCrack!\n“\nKuaaaaak\n!”\nHis jaw was ripped out as a strange scream tore the sky.\n“\nEik\n!”\nDan So-young turned her head away at the cruel sight. Ha Jong-oh, whose mouth was torn out, let out a groan and then shook his head in pain.\n‘!!!’\nEveryone was stunned at what had happened so suddenly and was at a loss for words. Chun Yeowun said to them,\n“I listened very patiently to what was going on, but in the end, it all sounded like bullshit.”\nPhat!\nChun Yeowun wiped the blood off his hands and threw away the body on its side.\nPak!\nThe escorts trembled, looking at the corpse that had died in immense pain. One shouted,\n“This crazy bastard seems to want everyone here dead—”\nShhh!\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun appeared in front of him. Flustered, the escort tried to draw out his sword, but Chun Yeowun’s hand went for his forehead.\nIt seemed like a:\n‘Forehead flick?’\nChun Yeowun flicked his finger.\nPang!\nThe head of the escort promptly exploded.\n‘!?’\nThe other escorts couldn’t understand what happened: the moment the finger was flicked, the head was completely blown away.\nShh!\nOne of the escorts even had to wipe the blood and flesh remains off his body, as it seemed like a piece of brain had splattered on him.\n“\nEik\n!”\nThud!\nThe escort fell to the floor, but what the escorts saw was so overwhelming that they took a step back.\nSh!\nWhen Chun Yeowun raised his hand, all their bodies floated into the air and were pulled close together. With their bodies imprisoned, they couldn’t move and looked at Chun Yeowun with fear in their eyes.\n“Are you going to spout bullshit too?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s question, they all shook their heads at the same time. They had just seen two horrible things happen right in front of their faces; who would dare speak?\nDan So-young spoke out,\n“W-wait, Chun Ma — Lord Chun Ma — if we kill all of them, we can’t get out of here.”\nShe was worried that this action might provoke the Ice Palace and cause her clan to be stuck in here, to which Chun Yeowun smirked.\n“You don’t need to worry about that.”\n“Huh?”\nChun Yeowun pulled out his right sleeve and held out his right hand.\nShhh!\nA gloomy, blue light flashed from the black iron wrist guard as something hazy came out.\n“S-spirit!”\nDan So-young, surprised at it, covered her mouth. The appearance of a Ghost was something one would almost never see. Chun Yeowun said to the Ghost,\n“Get all of them off the island.”\nWoong!\nAs soon as the words were said, Dan So-young’s vision changed. She staggered at the sudden change and then closed her eyes.\n‘What is happening here?’\nFor a moment when she opened her eyes, she trembled, unable to understand what was unfolding.\n“How is thi—”\nShe wasn’t the only one surprised. Dan Cho-jin, the leader of the clan, and Dan Cho-ja as well were looking around in shock.\nTheir location had definitely changed.\n“T-that?”\nWhat they were looking at now was Olkhon Island covered in lava. For a second, they thought they were hallucinating.\nWhisper!\nThe members of the clan too began to talk about what had happened so suddenly.\n“No way!”\nDan So-young looked at Chun Yeowun in disbelief.\nIn the blink of an eye, more than 200 members of the clan were moved away from the island. The people who realized it a little later shouted,\n“Woaaahhhhhh!”\n“We’re out of there!”\nThey were moved by the man who saved their lives. Dan Cho-jin looked at Chun Yeowun.\n‘\nY-You are God! The God of our clan has descended!’\n“Oooh! Demon God”\nDan Cho-jin was in awe of this tremendous ability, raised his hands high, and bowed to the ground, which made the others follow him.\n“Demon God!!”\nChun Yeowun was being worshiped as their God in an instant.\n‘H-How did this even happen?’\nUnlike the clan, which was happy about this, the escorts of the North Sea Ice Palace who were still under the pressure of Chun Yeowun’s energy were going crazy.\nFortunately, the only way to save their lives was gone. And to them, Chun Yeowun was a monster, not a God.\nChun Yeowun slowly approached them and asked,\n“I will ask only once. The North Sea Ice Palace… where is it?”",

      "content": "Chapter 184: North Sea Ice Palace (4)\nThe northern part of Olkhon Island is where the North Sea Ice Palace was located. Of course, it was no longer the place with tiles and the fantastic structure of Chinese culture, but modern buildings making up a town that is now a ghost town.\nThe town in North Sea Ice Palace did have civilians, but the important items and people had been moved using the tunnel for the past seven days. As a result, it was now vacant.\nThe North Sea Ice Palace, which suffered from various hardships such as the Turtle Dragon incident and the world war in the past, secretly built a tunnel to escape from the place.\nIn a tunnel connected through the lake's northwest side to the exit, five hundred soldiers from the North Sea Ice Palace were armed and surrounding the place. Interestingly, in those five hundred, one hundred had Russian Defense guns.\nClick!\nThe soldiers who were stationed there were pointing their guns to the exit.\n“Я еще не видел это.”\n(I haven’t seen them yet.)\nThe special unit leader reported to someone with a wireless earphone walkie-talkie. That someone was a blonde middle-aged man at a location where soldiers and courtiers from the North Sea Ice Palace had established a makeshift base camp behind the siege. He was also was wearing the military uniform of the Defense with the rank of a Major.\nThe Major put his hand on the radio.\n“понимаю. Будьте очень осторожны.”\n(I see. Be vigilant.)\nAfter giving the order, the Major turned his head and looked at someone. That person seemed like a middle-aged man with sagging eyes who looked like he was in his early 50s with long padded clothes and a furred hood.\nHe was Dan Kyeong-gak, the Lord of the North Sea Ice Palace.\n“Lord Dan. Happy now?”\nThe Major asked in a displeased voice. In response, the Lord bowed his head a little.\n“Thank you for the consideration you’ve shown, Major Verno.”\n“\nTch tch\n. We're being forced to perform a difficult task when we could have just knocked down the tunnel with one shot.”\nMajor Verno, a member of the defense department.\nThe North Sea Ice Palace people watching him weren't very pleased.\nIn particular, as if expressing dissatisfaction, Dan Young-soo, the young master of the Palace, stared at Major Verno and the grey-haired man in sunglasses with arms folded next to him.\n‘Crazy bastards. Destroy the tunnel? Is that an idea that even comes out of the human mind?’\nIf the tunnel collapses, two hundred people on the island would be deserted at once. And these defense people wanted that.\nDan Young-soo heard something in his mind.\n[Handle your expressions.]\nIt was the Lord of the Palace.\n[But father, aren’t their demands too high? No matter how far apart we stay and the blood has diluted, they are still the same as us. They share the same roots as us. And to kill them all is–!!]\n[I understand. However, after the massacre in China, they don’t like the Murim anymore. Especially if one is related to the Sky Demon Order.]\nLike the People’s Republic of China, the massacre event involved the Prime Minister of Russia, who opposed the federation government. Since then, the Russians have hated the people of China.\n[Still, this is too much. Surely that Modve….]\n[Uh!]\n[Phew… that person’s thing might have worked.]\nModve Radev, the Commander of one of Russia's four major armed forces.\nModve, one of the most powerful armed groups, inked an arrangement with the Ministry of Defense at a young age and wielded considerable power.\n[That Modve doesn’t dislike the outsiders because they are related to the Sky Demon Order, but he is afraid of the change that could happen, the change of four armed groups to five armed groups if they enter Russia officially.]\nUntil now, the position of the North Sea Ice Palace was vague. They weren’t entirely Russian or Murim.\nHowever, if they were now officially incorporated into the Ministry of Defense, this time, the North Sea Ice Palace would be strong enough to be called one of Russia’s five armed groups.\nFurthermore, if the outsiders' force of roughly 200 people is added, this man's position, Modve's, would be jeopardized.\n[It's not like the Palace doesn't know. The only solution is to limit the amount of damage we will sustain.]\nDan Young-soo nodded his head. He also knew now that his father wanted this. He hated the outsiders as hybrids, yet he stood back and waited for them to come because his power would increase significantly.\n‘I need to learn a lot from my father.’\nDan Young-soo considered his father a great leader. Either way, there was one thing that mattered.\nThe crucial question was whether or not the North Sea Ice Clan's Leader would accept the proposition.\n[But Father… Do we have to put in such a proposal? In a way, they too are the people who share the same blood and roots from us.]\nAt Dan Young-soo’s words, Dan Kyeong-gak said firmly.\n[Only the Lord of the Palace should learn the Cold Ice from Heaven techniques.]\nThis was something that only the Lord of the Palace should learn, and the outsiders were always considering them to be a part of the Sky Demon Order.\nThose who weren’t directly the descendants of the Palace but just allies were learning their technique and using it, from the point of view of the Palace Lord, it couldn’t be tolerated.\n[We aren’t after their lives, just the martial arts.]\n[But to waste such great levels of martial…]\nInstead of their lives, they were going after the dantian. However, for a Murim warrior, a destroyed dantian is equivalent to death.\n‘But if they accept it, they will be a part of the Palace.’\nOn this point, the father and son had different opinions. One values efficiency, the other respects the father, but his thoughts didn’t go well with him.\n‘The Palace Lord is Father…’\nSo he had no choice but to follow.\n[But Elder Ha hasn’t contacted us. Is it because of the lava?]\nElder Ha was the 3rd Elder. They did give him a walkie-talkie, but the man didn’t contact them back, which made them think it was because of the lava.\nThey had no idea what was happening. It was then….\nWhisper!\nThe was a sudden commotion happening outside the camp.\nOne of the escorts rushed in to report.\n“Lord! I think you should come outside.”\n“Out? Did something happen?”\n“They have appeared outside.”\n“They?”\n“T-those outsider bastards!”\n“What?”\nAt the puzzling words, Major Verno stood up. He hadn't heard anything about people coming through the tunnel, but they suddenly appeared outside? Everyone in the camp gathered.\nThe guards, escorts, and soldiers surrounded some people in the middle.\n“Dan Cho-jin!”\nThere were three men there. They were the Clan Leader, his son, and someone they saw for the first time.\nBut that wasn’t the problem.\n“This… What the hell is this?!”\nThe face of the Palace Lord Dan Kyeong-gak was red in anger. There was something round in the hand of the new person, and it was none other than the head of the 3rd Elder with his chin pulled out.\n“How did they get out?”\nContrary to him, Major Verno and Modve Radev were puzzled.\nTo them, it didn’t matter how they died inside the island. They just couldn’t understand how they got out.\nTaktak!\nMajor Verno tapped the radio with his finger.\n“This is Alpha. How did they get out?”\nA platoon soldier answered it while putting down the gun in his hand.\n-\nClick!\nBeta here. They didn’t come out from the tunnel.\n“Didn’t come out from the tunnel?”\n-They suddenly flew in from the sky.\n“What? Do they have special abilities…”\nIt was when Dan Young-soo intervened.\n“Not that.”\n“… What do you mean? Young Lord?”\nHe answered.\n“Perhaps they all came in through light footwork through the air?”\n“Light Footwork? The technique of running fast in murim?”\n“Yes.”\nDan Young-soo was convinced that these people used it. The Palace Lord was a Supreme Master-level warrior, so he could do it. However, Dan Cho-jin, who was almost on par with him, wasn’t that perfect.\n“Father.”\n“Uhh! It's those bastards again!”\nThe Palace Lord, Dan Kyeong-gak, was angrier seeing the dead head of the 3rd Elder, which was why Dan Young-soo tried to calm him.\n“Father. Please hold back. Now they seem to have given up on all those proposals and seem to have come here for revenge.”\n“Revenge?”\nDan Young-soo came to that decision. From the beginning, it was assumed that only two people could escape.\nHowever, seeing the head of the Elder, it seemed like they chose to sacrifice themselves rather than abandon their identity and clan, but this was unexpected.\n‘But who is he?’\nAlong with the two men was a young man.\nGrunt!\n“You are dogs in the end. Are you here to get revenge by killing everyone here?”\nDan Kyeong-gak stepped ahead in anger. He shouted using his internal energy.\n“You bastard! Dan Cho-jin! How dare you, a hybrid, touch the Elder! Your limbs will be cut off for you to come to your senses!”\nThe soldiers had to cover their ears from the loud voice. The voice was as ferocious as a lion.\n“As expected, so great.”\nMajor Verno mumbled in admiration. In response, Modve Radev said,\n“That is nothing, Major. All murim warriors can do that.”\nHe did say that, but he was also shocked.\nHe knew that the old man was the Palace Lord and that he was strong, but not this strong.\nAt that time, Dan Cho-jin, the Clan Leader, shouted in reply.\n“That is what I want to say! How can you force your fellow people into such a situation!”\nNormally, he would be terrified of the Palace, but now he was just filled with disappointment.\nMajor Verno frowned at the voice, which didn’t fall in comparison.\n“Well, that one is a dangerous person too.”\n“I think the same. Just kill him.”\nAt Modve’s suggestion, Major Verno nodded. But Dan Young-soo tried to dissuade them.\n“Wait a minute, Major Verno. The Palace Lord has to talk….”\n“Talk what? Hasn’t your request been granted already?”\nMajor Verno refused to listen. He touched his earphone and gave the orders.\n“This is Alpha.”\n—\nClick!\nOrders, please.\n“Kill them.”\n— Roger!\nAs soon as the words fell, about a hundred soldiers loaded their guns.\nClick!\nThis made Dan Cho-jin and Dan Cho-ja bewildered. They followed Chun Yeowun to break apart from the Palace for good, but they didn’t know that the Russian Defense Ministry would be here.\nDan Cho-jin shouted in a hurry.\n“Stop! Do you know who is here!”\nWhich made Major Verno laugh.\n“You’re all so funny. Who came? Huh! Who is here?!”\nThen he gave the order again.\nThem moment he commanded, the soldiers began to scream.\n“Shoot!”\nTatatatang!\nHundreds of soldiers fired their guns at once.\n“\nKuak!\nGear up!”\nDan Cho-jin and Dan Cho-ja drew out their swords and raised the cold energy at once.\nThey were strong, but they couldn’t block all the bullets coming.\nHowever….\n“What? This is?”\nAn amazing thing happened.\nBullets fired by hundreds of soldiers had stopped in mid-air less than a meter away. As they continued to fire, the bullets came to a halt.\n‘The bullets?’\nThe soldiers were shocked at what had happened before them.\n“W-what is this?”\nMajor Verno was confused as the Palace Lord who was next to him.\nHowever, he was also not in the right mind to explain.\n‘No. Could this power be that one?’\nHe never thought anyone could have such vital internal energy.\nEven he, who reached the Supreme Master level, couldn't stop a bullet with energy alone.\nTatatang!\nAnd with that, the soldiers who were shooting stopped; they had run out of bullets.\nThey quickly changed the magazine and shot again, but Chun Yeowun turned his palm lightly and waved his hand.\nIt was then…\nPapapak!\n“\nKuak\n!”\n“\nAck\n!”\n“\nUgh\n!”\nBullets that had stopped flew back to the soldiers and hit them. The entire unit was baptized instantly, and they fell with screams of pain.\n‘!!!’\nA moment of silence.\nWhen hundreds of soldiers fell, Major Verno panicked and yelled.\n“Tt-that monster! Who is he?”\nThe Palace Lord answered.\n“I don’t know him.”\n“Lord Dan! If you don’t know, who here will know? Damn it! This shouldn’t happen. Quickly tell your men to stop that monster!”\nChun Yeowun’s monster-like ability to annihilate soldiers at once made Major Verno lose his mind. As that was happening, the Elders of the North Sea Ice Palace came ahead and shouted.\n“Warriors of the Palace! Kill them!”\nThe guards pulled their weapons at the same time. They, too, were shocked at what happened, but they had the numbers to take down three people.\nAt that time, Chun Yeowun leisurely walked ahead, raised his palm, and lowered it.\n“Kneel.”\nAfter that..\nThud! Thud! Thud!\n“\nEuk\n!”\n“M-my body!”\nNot a single warrior could move ahead and harm them and kneeled. The faces of the guards were confused at this. They were forcibly brought down to their knees!\n“H-How can this….”\n“No!”\nThe Elders of the North Sea Ice Palace were losing words.\nFour hundred guards of their Palace were on their knees right in front of their eyes. This was an impossible situation.\nDan Cho-jin walked and shouted.\n“The Chun Ma of the great Sky Demon Order has arrived! Won’t the Palace Lord of the North Sea Ice Palace come and kneel?”\nAt that cry, the eyes of Dan Kyeong-gak and Dan Young-soo widened.\n‘Chun Ma?’",

      "content": "Chapter 185: Palace Lord (1)\n‘Chun Ma?’\n‘\nThe\nChun Ma?’\nHearing the title proclaimed by Dan Cho-jin, everyone went silent.\nThe moment they heard the title, the people of the Palace couldn't hide their shock. They, too, were under the Sky Demon Order for a long time and thus knew what the name meant.\n“Father, isn’t the Sky Demon Order in ruins right now?”\nDan Young-soo asked his father, unable to understand. His father nodded,\n“Yes, but I have no clue what this is.”\nIt was natural for them to react so cluelessly. 27 years back, the Sky Demon Order had given up on everything and went into hiding; the North Sea Ice Palace took the chance to cut off their contact with China completely.\nSince then, North Sea Ice Palace started making efforts to be incorporated into Russia.\nIt was no exaggeration to say that the people of the Palace knew nothing of the current events happening in China.\n“What are you talking about? Lord Dan! What are those Chinese bastards talking about?!”\nMajor Verno yelled on top of his lungs, unable to understand the circumstances.\n‘Fucking shit!’\nDan Kyeong-gak and his son felt embarrassed: the Russian government hated the Sky Demon Order, but Dan Cho-jin had openly proclaimed the monster-like newcomer as Chun Ma.\n“T-that--”\n“What are they talking about?! Didn’t he just call that man the Chun Ma of the Sky Demon Order?”\nDan Cho-jin was surprised by Modve’s ability to understand Chinese.\n“What? The Sky Demon Order? The group involved in the massacre 27 years ago?”\nMajor Verno began to emit an aura of hostility now, prompting Dan Young-soo to intervene.\n“Major! They aren’t related to us. In addition, the Sky Demon Order collapsed so long ago that there’s no way anyone can be related to them.”\nModve intervened,\n“Putting that aside, it is indeed strange that a person of the Sky Demon Order has entered Russia. Major, aren’t all affiliated individuals banned from entering the country?”\nModve talked excitedly, not wanting to miss the chance to ruin North Sea Ice Palace’s chancecs of being incorporated into Russia.\nStep!\nMeanwhile, Chun Yeowun took steps towards them, increasing the pressure in the atmosphere with each step.\nTerrified by the abilities Chun Yeowun had showed, Major Verno shouted,\n“L-Lord Dan! That monster is coming! If you really have nothing to do with them, what can I do here?”\nModve stepped ahead.\n“Modve?”\n“Major, give me a chance.”\n“Ah! You want to fight?”\nMajor Verno was pleased with Modve’s willingness to help.\nDespite Modve’s assignment to assist Major Verno, he couldn’t just give orders to Modve, who was one of the heads of Russia’s four armed groups.\n“Leave it to me.”\nWith those proud words, Modve walked towards Chun Yeowun as strategies ran through his mind.\n‘This man was gifted with abilities.’\nModve was convinced that Chun Yeowun used abilities and not martial arts, and had counted two abilities so far. He considered it Chun Yeowun’s telekinesis ability to be at the SS-level.\n‘However, all abilities have fatal weaknesses.’\nAll abilities have weaknesses; Chun Yeowun’s ability was weak in combat, and it would be easy to neutralize him before he had the chance to demonstrate any other abilities.\n‘I’ll just move towards him for now.’\nModve loosened the belt he had on, setting it on the ground.\nThere were three knives and a pistol attached to the belt, and as he put it down, he raised his hand and said,\n“I want to talk.”\nSaying those words, he walked closer to Chun Yeowun as Dan Cho-ja informed Chun Yeowun of what he knew about Modve.\n“Lord Chun Ma. That man is Modve Radev, a leader of one of the four armed groups in Russia.”\n“Really?”\nWhen the North Sea Ice clan had come back to Russia, they were first sent to two of the armed groups that monitored their immigration, allowing him to gain some knowledge of the Russian bureaucracy and officials.\nModve approached Chun Yeowun and said,\n“I heard you came from China. We have no information about your arrival, so you must have come here illegally, right?”\nModve went straight to the topic, to which Chun Yeowun answered,\n“So?”\n“So, there is a high ranking official from the Russian government here. I think you understand where I’m going with this.”\nModve thought any decent human would quickly understand and realize the repercussions of their actions.\n“So?”\n‘!?’\nModve’s brows twitched.\nDespite the mention of the Russian government, Chun Yeowun’s reaction didn’t change. Modve assumed that Chun Yeowun would at least try to converse, but he didn’t seem like he wanted to talk at all.\n‘Tsk. As if that wasn’t enough, he had even killed Russian soldiers without blinking an eye.’\nThe man’s behavior would be understandable if he was confident in his own power. Realizing this, Modve decided to use his backup plan.\nClap!\nModve clapped and laughed,\n“Hahaha! Indeed, spoken like a true SS-class person. If you had given in simply because I mentioned the government, I would have been quite disappointed.”\nHe was now acting bold.\n“I like you. You see, Russia doesn’t allow the people of China to enter, but I think it’s acceptable with your level of power.”\nModve chuckled and raised his thumb, continuing to speak,\n“What about this? A person of your strength would be greatly appreciated in the Russian government. Considering that less lives would have to be sacrificed, would you consider standing down to and joining Russia? I promise to treat you right.”\nHis backup plan was to buy Chun Yeowun as a mercenary.\nThe stronger one was, the higher their pride. But, if the right conditions were given, there was a chance for the pride to be quelled and the situation to be settled.\nNormally, most people who would accept Modve’s conditions, but,\n“No need.”\n‘!?’\nChun Yeowun’s blunt refusal made Modve’s brows twitch once again, as he had rejected both of Modve’s options.\n‘How is he so picky?!’\nNow, there was only one way left for Modve: the method that he had initially planned. As if feeling troubled, Modve said,\n“It’s quite absurd how difficult you’re being. It would be a waste to fight someone as strong as you. Can we settle this peacefully?”\nAlong with those words, Modve took another step closer to Chun Yeowun.\n‘Six more steps closer to him.’\nModve was one of the three top martial artists in Russia. He could kill anyone 100 away, but against a monster like Chun Yeowun, he had to be much closer. Somehow, he had to close a distance of five more steps to kill him.\nHis skill was Silent Break, which allowed him to ignore the opponent’s defenses and increase his speed for those five steps.\n‘Five more steps.’\nModve tried to speak naturally as he tried to get closer,\n“The Gate is open and we can’t close it, so we should work together and fight—”\n“I’m going to warn you. If you want to live, don’t take another step.”\n‘!?’\nTaking in Chun Yeowun’s words, Modve paused. Did this man read his intentions? He stopped his feet as it hung in the air.\n‘…’\nAnother step and everything would have been resolved, but Chun Yeowun didn’t let that happen. Flustered, Modve scratched his head and spoke with a puzzled expression,\n“Huh. This is the first time I’ve met someone like you. Before I’ve even attacked—”\nIt was then.\nPak!\nModve stepped forward as fast as a flash of lightning and tried to use his technique.\nShh!\nHis arm, which moved like a whip, aimed for Chun Yeowun’s heart. He moved so fast that even Dan Cho-jin didn’t notice what happened.\nIn Modve’s mind, time moved slowly.\n‘This is the end for you.’\nHis fingers were imbued with a white light from all of the energy coalescing at his fingers, which would allow him to easily penetrate his target.\nHowever,\nPak!\n“Huh?”\nThe hand that Modve placed all of his confidence in didn’t pierce Chun Yeowun, but was in fact being held by him.\n“Y-you blocked it?”\nModve couldn’t hide his shock. To him, Chun Yeowun responded in an emotionless voice,\n“Taking your time and then acting fast, so Russian-like.”\nChun Yeowun raised his hand, exerting enough pressure to make the heart beat faster. Modve hurriedly tried to shake off the hand holding his but it was to no avail.\n“W-wait—”\nFlustered, he tried to ask Chun Yeowun to stop, but,\nSmash!\n“\nKuaaak\n!”\nChun Yeowun lowered his hand, and Modve’s body slowly crashed down into the ground.\n“Modve!”\nMajor Verno cried out in panic.\nOne of the best martial artists in Russia was defeated in mere seconds. Out of fear, he looked at the Palace Lord.\n“Y-You! How did this happen? The Russian Defense will never let you live if I’m hurt by this monster! Get it? Are you listening to me?”\nNo one was listening to him, as everyone was focused on Chun Yeowun.\n‘Monster… he is a monster.’\n‘In just one move, the strongest man died…’\nIt was a startling scene. Although he seemed to die with such little resistance, Modve was known to be extraordinarily strong, even stronger than the North Sea Ice Lord.\nTremble!\nDan Young-soo tried to strengthen himself but his body didn’t listen to him.\n‘This is the Chun Ma…’\nA story from the North Sea Ice Palace that he had forgotten suddenly came to his mind.\n[Never disobey the Chun Ma. If a being with the title of Chun Ma is born again in the Sky Demon Order in particular, obey them unconditionally.]\nIt was an absurd rule. Although it now seemed like a rational warning, it was considered as a joke by the people of the past.\nAs generations passed, people became dissatisfied with the rule, but seeing this man here, the Palace Lord realized what kind of existence the Chun Ma was.\n‘Not human.’\nHis strength didn’t belong to a human; no person in the North Sea Ice Palace could tackle this man, whether alone or with others.\n‘We should avoid fighting.’\nDan Young-soo who quickly made the decision that it would be better to surrender and plead guilty than to fight and lose all their lives.\n“Fa…ther.”\nDan Young-soo called his father in a cautious way. Fortunately, it seemed like they both had the same thoughts as he nodded he said to his son:\n[Son… it seems like our generation will not be able to escape from the grasp of the Sky Demon Order.]\nIt was a bitter choice of words, so Dan Young-soo tried to comfort his father.\n[Father… this must be fate. It would be best to make a promise to ensure our future; infact, this could even help strengthen the power in the palace.]\n[Thank you for cheering me up.]\nDan Kyeong-gak clenched his fist, walking ahead as he looked at Dan Cho-jin.\nDan Cho-jin had gone under the Sky Demon Order because he had already thought about joining it as one entity, but the Palace didn’t want it.\n‘I will never let those hybrids get close to the seat of power after they’ve succumbed to the Sky Demon Order.’\nHe had to strike some kind of a deal. In return for their surrender, he was going to ask Chun Yeowun to make some sanctions and prevent the outsiders from learning their Palace technique.\n‘I have the Palace under me so he will grant me a request.’\nHe stepped forward, followed by his son and the elders of the Palace.\n“L-Lord Dan!”\nMajor Verno was left alone and at a loss for what to do. Either way, the North Sea Ice Palace people began to move and got down on one knee.\nTak!\n“Dan Kyeong-gak, the Lord of the North Sea Ice Palace, greets the Chun Ma of the Sky Demon Order.”\nEveryone greeted him.\n“So late.”\nChun Yeowun said in an uncomfortable voice. Hearing that, Dan Kyeong-gak bowed his head and shouted,\n“Please forgive me for not knowing Chun Ma has come and committing this sin!”\n“Forgive…?”\nInstead of punishment, he had asked for forgiveness; since he was the Palace Lord, he still had a bit of pride.\nNormally, he would have been on his knees with his head on the ground, but he was only on one knee and slightly bowed.\nShhh!\nHe raised his head and looked up at Chun Yeowun, who kept looking down at him with eyes that seemed to have daggers in them.\nDan Kyeong-gak bit his lips and said,\n“The Palace will be returning to the Sky Demon Order and will show the same loyalty as our ancestors. Please, Chun Ma, accept us even if we are weak.”\n“Ha!”\nDan Cho-ja snorted at that.\nUntil a moment ago, the Palace Lord had considered the Sky Demon Order to be a broken clan, but now seeing Chun Yeowun’s power, his attitude changed completely.\n‘Opportunists.’\nDan Cho-ja was disappointed with them, but what could he do?\nWhether he liked it or not, they were clearly relatives who shared blood. It was strange that their prolonged fight was resolved this way, but at least they managed to reunite in some way.\nHowever, Dan Gyeong-gak’s words didn’t there,\n“However, My Lord, I hope that a cost will be paid for our re-entry into the Sky Demon Order.”\n“Cost?”\nChun Yeowun narrowed his eyes as the man continued to speak,\n“In the Palace, there are traditions that have been followed since ancient times, similar to our relationship to the Sky Demon Order in a way.”\n“So?”\n“I implore you to sanction the Palace cultivation techniques to our Palace members only so that no one else can learn them.”\nDan Kyeong-gak looked at Dan Cho-jin and his son.\nIn other words, he wanted Chun Yeowun’s help to destroy the others’ dantians.\n‘This cheeky bastard!’\nBoth the father and son were enraged. It was absurd for the Palace to ask for sanctions of this nature when they were the ones trying to kill their own people.\nChun Yeowun asked,\n“Why?”\n“The Cold Ice from Heaven Cultivation is something only the Palace Lord can master. Please consider this similar to the one technique that only the Lord of the Sky Demon Order can learn and no one else.”\nIn order to not raise objections, Sky Demon Order was constantly being brought into the conversation. Chun Yeowun stroked his chin as if he was thinking about it.\n‘Yes!’\nDan Kyeong-gak smiled at the sight of Chun Yeowun thinking, thinking that he at least managed to protect his seat.\n“Hmm. Right, let’s do that.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, Dan Kyeong-gak put his hands together and thanked him.\n“Thank you Chun Ma for–”\nIt was then.\nSlash!\n“Kuak!”\nDan Kyeong-gak’s eyes widened. He hurriedly grabbed his neck as he felt something sharp pass through his throat.\n“W-why…”\nChun Yeowun smiled and said,\n“Didn’t you say that only the Palace Lord can learn it?”",

      "content": "Chapter 186: Palace Lord (2)\n“Father!”\nDan Young-soo, the Young Lord of the North Sea Ice Palace, cried aloud. He jumped from the ground at the sight of his father holding his neck.\nHe also sensed that sharp sound.\n‘No! No!’\nA red line is clearly drawn on his father’s neck. It felt like his father’s head would fall off if his father let go of his neck.\nUnable to contain his anger, Dan Young-soo yelled.\n“What did you do?! My father fell on his knees despite having such high pride and honor!”\nChun Yeowun responded to him with an emotionless voice.\n“I gave what he wanted.”\n“What?! What nonsense is that?!”\nThe 2nd Elder Dal Chan asked.\nSrng!\n“Who gave you all the permission to stand?”\n“Huh?”\nHowever, Dan Cho-ja, who had his sword out, moved it with lightning speed and aimed it at his neck.\nThe coldness which spread from the sword wasn’t normal.\n‘Cold Ice of Heaven!’\nThe 2nd Elder Dal Chan was shocked. Other than the Palace Lord and his kids, this was the first time he saw someone else master it.\nWhen the 2nd Elder couldn’t move, Chun Yeowun spoke again.\n“Wasn’t this what you wanted? Only the Palace Lord can learn it.”\n“W-what are you even trying to say?”\n“It is as I said.”\nDan Young-soo was still furious. Is Chun Yeowun saying that he was going to replace the Palace Lord?\nHe was terrified of the power Chun Yeowun had, but he couldn’t stand back anymore.\n“Regardless of the fact that we are a part of the Sky Demon Order, how can you change the Lord at your will...”\n“You are a cheeky one.”\n“Huh?”\nChun Yeowun moved his hand.\nCrack! Thud!\n“Kuaak!”\nWith that, Dan Young-soo knelt as both of his legs were broken at once. Only by looking at the bone poking through the skin, one could tell how terrible it was.\n“Young Lord!”\nThe startled elders all stood up. They had deeper loyalty than fear. The 1st Elder Oh Yang-saeng, who was known to be strong, spoke loudly.\n“This is excessive! Even if the Palace is under the Sky Demon Order, the laws of the Palace have been respected till now. How can you recklessly trample on our pride without a second thought?”\n“Right! If you act like this, even we will…”\nWoong!\nAt that moment, tremendous energy raged from Chun Yeowun’s body. It was so strong that even those voicing their anger were at a loss for words.\n‘I-is this man really a human?’\nIt felt like their heart could stop at any moment. Still, they were Murim warriors who were known to be proud.\nTo them, Chun Yeowun said in an indifferent voice.\n“Something is being misunderstood here.”\n“Ugh..”\n“Who do you think gave you what you have?”\nThe elders didn’t answer the question.\nIt was because of the suppression, but they also had no idea what was being asked.\nThen Chun Yeowun raised his hand up.\nJjkkk!\nA strange coldness spread in the air as numerous Air Swords with Ice Qi were created.\nThe Palace guards who were forced to kneel looked at the Ice Swords in the sky with soulless eyes. The eyes of the elders trembled at the extraordinary sight.\nAll of them sensed familiar energy from the coldness.\n“Cold Ice from Heaven!”\nClearly, this was the same.\nEven the dead Palace Lord couldn’t have done it so amazingly. Astonishingly, what Chun Yeowun was doing seemed like the best version of the technique.\n‘No!’\n‘How could this person come to know of this?’\nThe elders were dumbfounded. Looking at them, Dan Cho-jin clicked his tongue.\n“You people did such a foolish thing. You mean you didn’t even realize that you were deceiving people?”\n“… What do you mean?”\n“You people are in the wrong. I don’t know when you started saying that you learned the technique, but it is the other way around.”\n“Other way?”\n“In the past, the ancestors said that those who recover the lost technique of the Cold Ice from Heaven technique will be the ones to qualify as the Palace Lord. Do you really not know where this technique came from?”\nEveryone looked at Chun Yeowun.\nTheir faces hardened one after another—a man who had a better technique output than the Palace Lord.\n‘No!’\nThey all looked at him in disbelief. They were all aware of the story that came down from their ancestors, a story of how the North Sea Ice Palace went under the Sky Demon Order.\n“N-No…”\nThe 1st Elder Oh Yang-saeng looked at Chun Yeowun with trembling eyes.\nHe was under the impression that Chun Yeowun was a new Chun Ma born in the Sky Demon Order. However, thanks to the hint given by Dan Cho-jin, he fully understood it.\n‘H-how did this happen… was the legend true?’\nHe also knew about the legend that came down from the Seong Mu-chun, but everyone dismissed it as a story that was passed down.\nHowever, the thousand swords that are floating in the air…\n‘Sky Flash!’\nThe absolute technique of the Demon God Chun Yeowun, Sky Flash.\nRealizing that, he reacted faster than anyone.\nThud!\n“T-this insignificant man greets the Demon God of Sky Demon Order!”\n‘Demon God!’\nWhen he said that and fell to the floor, the other surprised Elders fell and shouted.\n“We greet the Demon God!”\nDemon God Chun Yeowun.\nEven if they were the North Sea Ice Palace which was eager to get out of the grasp of the affiliation of the Sky Demon Order, this was someone everyone acknowledged.\nHe is the Demon God who rebuilt the palace that was destroyed by the Turtle Dragon and restored the lost technique.\n“Kuaaaa!”\nDan Young-soo, who had both his legs broken, was disconcerted by the elders' attitude. He thought they would side with him till the end. However, when Chun Yeowun’s identity was revealed, everyone bowed down.\n“So slow.”\nChun Yeowun clicked his tongue as he saw them lying down.\nHe spoke with a distasteful voice.\n“I heard you wanted to be incorporated into Russia?”\n“T-that…”\nSilence fell with fear in the eyes of the elders. There was no excuse.\nNo, they had no choice but to keep their mouths shut because they knew they would receive punishment whatever they said.\n“Well, you can’t just pass….”\n“Ahh…”\nSurprisingly, Chun Yeowun let it pass easily, making them all exhale in response.\nChun Yeowund decided that these people entering Russia were very good for many reasons.\n“However, trying to take down a clan by pushing them into the lava is like challenging my authority of the clan.”\nShh!\nChun Yeowun grabbed the sword and slightly stirred it.\nChachachacha!\nAt that, all the elders banged their heads on the floor.\nThud! Thud!\nThey kept hitting their faces again and again and screamed like crazy.\n“\nKuaaak\n!”\n“\nAack\n! My arm!”\nThe reason they were bowing and screaming was simple. It was because their left arm was cut off.\nThe elders, who thought that they were given a free pass, couldn’t hide their shock when their arm was cut off without notice.\nChun Yeowun spoke to those who were in pain.\n“Be grateful that I will end it with this.”\nThey couldn’t speak back and bowed their heads in gratitude.\n“\nKuak\n.. D-Demon God, we thank you for the grace shown.”\n“Thank you for being so graceful!”\nWith that, the punishment is done.\n‘So clean.’\nDan Cho-ja thought of the clean movement of the sword. Decisions were made in an instant with no second thoughts.\nChun Yeowun turned his head.\n“And you.”\nHe looked at Dan Young-soo, the Young Lord of the Palace, who had his legs broken and barely supported his body. At the sight of the elders surrendering, he hurriedly said,\n“P-please have mercy on me.”\nIt seemed like the anger for his father’s death had gone down, he looked at Chun Yeowun begging, and the man looked at him with a firm voice.\n“You and your father were quite a fussy bunch.”\n“No! We just went to the palace…”\n“I don’t want to hear it.”\nBefore he could even finish, Chun Yeowun raised his finger slightly up.\nAnd,\nCrack!\nDan Young-soo’s jawbone was crushed down, and his mouth went shut. It wasn’t bleeding or anything like that, but it was a weird shape where it didn’t seem like the jaw would work.\n“Umumum!”\nDan Young-soo, who felt such pain for the first time in his life, shed tears and begged for his life.\n‘Ah…’\nDan Cho-jin couldn’t hide his sadness at it. A little while ago, they were all angry at each other. However, when this man was pleading like this, his heart shattered.\nHe fell on the floor and begged.\n“C-Chun Ma. Although the Young Lord might have sinned, please have mercy on him and spare his life.”\n“Father, how can you?!”\nDan Cho-ja, the Young Leader, couldn’t hide his frustration at his father’s request.\nThe Palace people aimed to kill all of the clan people by trapping them on the island; it was absurd to show compassion to such a person.\nChun Yeowun looked at Dan Cho-jin’s face and asked,\n“Are you na?ve? Or just simple-minded?”\n“Huh?”\nAs soon as the words finished, he drew the sword.\nSlash!\nDan Young-soo’s neck, which he constantly rubbed to release the jaw, got slashed, and he fell.\nThe body and head are both cut without any remorse. Chun Yeowun spoke in a cold voice to Dan Cho-jin, who stared at him blankly.\n“Do you think those who betrayed you once will not do it again?”\n“T-that…”\n“You know what an incompetent leader means? You, people like you who are swept away by emotions.”\nChun Yeowun said that and looked at Dan Cho-ja.\n“In that aspect, you are pretty good at this.”\n‘Ahh!’\nTak!\nAt the praise, Dan Cho-ja bowed down. His heart was pounding as the Demon God of the legends acknowledged him.\nBut then,\n“Aaahh!”\nWith a shout, someone rushed towards Chun Yeowun. And he hurriedly tried to swing his sword when Dan Cho-ja moved in to stop him.\nChachacha!\nAt that moment, the coldness forming on the sword was stopped halfway. Dan Cho-ja looked at him with shocked eyes.\n“H-How?”\nSurprisingly, it was Dan Kyeong-gak, the Palace Lord. He, who was supposed to be dead with a throat cut, was staring at Chun Yeowun, wanting to kill him.",

      "content": "Chapter 187: Palace Lord (3)\nWhisper whisper!\nThe surroundings became chaotic when Dan Kyeong-gak, the Palace Lord of the North Sea Ice Palace, appeared with a pale face.\nHe had clearly been decapitated by Chun Yeowun’s Invisible Sword, but was somehow still alive.\n‘Hm.’\nChun Yeowun looked at the Palace Lord’s neck that had been slashed, but was surprised to see a strong ice formation around the injury.\n‘He stopped his death by freezing everything around the neck?’\nIt was an action that exceeded common sense, so even Chun Yeowun had a difficult time understanding it.\nIn order to survive the decapitation, one had to possess an immortal body, but only Chun Yeowun had achieved such. Dan Kyeong-gak glared at Chun Yeowun,\n“You killed my son!”\nDan Kyeong-gak was angry; seeing his son die right before his eyes, he didn’t care about the difference in strength.\nAll Chun Yeowun was to him now was an enemy.\nChachachang!\nDan Kyeong-gak made sure to use the North Sea Ice Cultivation to imbue a freezing energy within the sword as Dan Cho-ja looked at him with a nervous face.\n‘The cold energy is growing stronger.’\nAlthough Dan Kyeong-gak was old, he was still someone who had learned the North Sea Ice Cultivation all his life and was known for his strength. The state of rage he was in allowed him to instantly cross the level of power he had reached.\n“Get lost!”\nDan Kyeong-gak urged Dan Cho-ja who was in the way. Dan Cho-ja replied,\n“Lord Dan, it’s already happened. I don’t know how you survived but those who cross the line will have to pay, so stop.”\nGrunt!\nHearing those words, Dan Kyeong-gak grunted.\n“Cross the line? If you people hadn’t brought in that monster, this would have never happened! You dirty dogs! I will deal with you all first!”\nDan Kyeong-gak diverted his anger towards Dan Cho-ja, changing his target in an instant and aiming his sword at Dan Cho-ja, the Clan Leader’s son.\nChachachak!\nDan Cho-ja unfolded his Light Footwork technique and responded to Dan Kyeong-gak’s new attack. Ever since the Black Sky Company was destroyed, the North Sea Ice clan had continued to run and gained experience fighting numerous people, allowing Dan Cho-ja to move quickly.\n‘Here!’\nPapak!\nDan Cho-ja’s sword dug into the gaps of Dan Kyeong-gak’s technique and aimed for his heart. Fortunately, Dan Kyoeng-gak’s sword was simple and used a rudimentary form, but,\nClang!\n“Uh?”\nIt certainly pierced Dan Kyeong-gak’s head, but Dan Cho-ja’s sword bounced off from the strong force that rose in the impact.\nHe was sent back at twice the force that he used in his sword swing.\nSwish!\nDan Cho-ja’s sword missed for just a moment, but that small chance was all Dan Kyeong-gak needed.\n“\nHmp\n!”\nDan Kyeong-gak was about to strike Dan Cho-ja down like a bolt of lightning; Dan Cho-ja was able to watch it happen, but he had lost balance and wasn’t in the state to avoid the attack.\n‘Damn it!’\nAt that moment, someone stabbed Dan Kyeong-gak in the ankle.\nIt was Dan Cho-jin, who immediately moved close when he thought that his son was in danger.\n‘Huh?’\nHowever, despite the sword stabbing Dan Kyeong-gak’s ankle, his hand didn’t stop as if he would kill Dan Cho-ja even if it meant losing his arm.\n“Die!”\nAt that moment, Dan Kyeong-gak moved.\nHe changed his posture to take the balance off of his hurt ankle, and moved until a weird energy pulled back the hand about to cut down Dan Cho-ja’s arm.\n“You’re so bothersome.”\nChun Yeowun said, making Dan Kyeong-gak’s face harden.\n‘Ugh! This bastard!’\nShhh!\nThanks to Chun Yeowun, Dan Cho-ja didn’t die. However, Dan Kyeong-gak was still adamant in taking down Dan Cho-ja. The moment Dan Cho-jin’s sword reached him,\nPang!\n“\nKuak\n!”\nDan Cho-jin, who was attacking with a decent amount of force, was bounced back along with the sword.\n‘The sword didn’t even touch him?’\nBrrrr!\nDan Cho-jin’s sword trembled from the impact; it was a treasured sword made by a capable blacksmith, but the tip of the blade had cracked.\n‘Is this man’s martial arts that strong?’\nDan Cho-jin glared at the Palace Lord with tense eyes, but even Dan Kyeong-gak was surprised at what he did. He, too, thought that he’d lose an arm.\n‘What was that energy just now? Was it…?’\nDan Kyoeng-gak looked at his chest, and with a happy expression on his face, he moved once more.\nPhat!\nHis opponent this time was Dan Cho-jin, who was barely strong enough with his breaking weapon.\nJjkkk!\nDan Kyoeng-gak formed ice in every direction with his sword to reduce the distance he had to move, but since he was rushing in to kill them, he didn’t concentrate enough on his surroundings.\n“You stupid… Huh?”\nPapang!\nDan Kyeong-gak’s body collided with the ice, which didn’t form correctly. In fact, an even colder energy rose in the opposite of Dan Cho-jin’s location and moved towards him.\nChachachang!\nDan Cho-jin hurriedly used his sword to take down the ice walls that formed, but the walls were quite strong and ended up pushing him back.\n“Father!”\nEven Dan Cho-ja couldn’t believe his eyes.\nIn the midst of the chaos, Dan Kyeong-gak went closer to Dan Cho-jin and immediately began to unfold a new technique to finish him off.\nThe technique came in like a crashing wave, creating numerous long strokes that carved out a path.\nPapapak!\n‘Shit!’\nDan Cho-jin, who wanted to avoid this at all costs, unfolded the Sword of Ice Cold Heaven.\nAlthough the technique unfolded in an unstable way, since he had used it for such a long time, he was able to manage to handle it stably.\nChachacha!\nWhen the two of them collided, a strong pounding sound resonated. Everyone watched the confrontation between the head of two North Sea Ice factions: the Palace Lord and the Clan Leader.\nEveryone was curious about who was stronger between the Lord and Leader.\nChachachachang!\nHowever, contrary to what they expected, the fight ended very quickly.\nSince Dan Cho-jin had to constantly move to unfold his technique, the ice shards rushing in from Dan Kyeong-gak’s technique hit him easily.\nPapak!\n“\nKuak\n!”\nDan Cho-jin was hit, causing blood to gush out of his mouth. His son, Dan Cho-ja, was shocked at the outcome.\n‘My father lost?’\nHe believed that his father would come out victorious, never imagining that the loss would be this quick. Since his injuries were serious, Dan Cho-jin staggered and stepped back.\n“Hahahaha! Just as I expected, you dog!”\n“\nKuak\n!”\nBecause of the pain, Dan Cho-jin couldn’t even talk back.\nHowever, in reality, it was hard to understand what had happened. If their techniques were compared, Dan Cho-jin’s technique was much more developed, so why this the outcome?\n‘Why did this happen? Was it because he reacted quicker?’\nAn unknown force seemed to be protecting Dan Kyeong-gak, and if he couldn’t be damaged, the fight was meaningless.\nDan Kyeong-gak opened his mouth with a smile,\n“Now you’re all dead…”\nSlash!\nAt that moment, a small sensation passed through his neck.\n“Cough!”\nDan Kyeong-gak hurriedly tried to grab his neck, but his hand was stopped by Chun Yeowun’s energy.\n“If you came back by freezing yourself, then you can’t come back by …hm?”\nChun Yeowun stopped speaking.\nSomething surprising was happening right in front of him.\nSrrrr!\nOf course, it would have been normal for him to die since his head was cut off.\nHowever, something creeped out of his neck and the severed neck was fixed once more. And that wasn’t surprising enough, the skin around the neck began to regenerate again.\n‘What is that? Nano, check it.’\n[Yes.]\nAfter Nano’s response, Chun Yeowun’s eyes trembled and his sight widened. When he zoomed in and looked closely, it seemed like thin wires were protruding from the bottom of the neck and reattaching it to the upper part.\n“I need to have a closer look!”\nShh!\nChun Yeowun held out his hand and pretended to pull something in as a strong energy pulled Dan Kyeong-gak’s body.\nHowever, a strong force rose as a white light shone within Dan Kyoeng-gak, who was about to rise.\nPang!\nAt the same time, Chun Yeowun’s energy was dispersed. No, to be precise, it was repelled.\nPrrr!\nChun Yeowun’s fingers trembled because the force that was reflected back was twice as strong.\n“Ha?”\nIt felt absurd.\nOn the other hand, the Palace Lord, who endured everything, couldn't hide his happiness.\n‘I can withstand that monster too?’\nThe fact that he was able to endure and hold back the monster made him feel great about himself. Dan Kyeong-gak licked his lips and smiled,\n“Hahahahhaha! Did everyone see that? Even the Demon God can’t do anything to this Palace Lord!”\nChik!\nThen, he ripped off the shirt. When he tore off the robe, he revealed a hidden garment that made Dan Cho-ja shout in surprise.\n“Ice Cold Spear!”\nThe golden upper body armor that covered the body was the Ice Cold Spear, the sacred item of this palace.\nOriginally, it took the form of a staff, but it was a treasure that changed into armor when a certain amount of energy was put in.\n“This is the power of the Ice Cold Spear, the divine item of the Palace!”\nThe gold iron wires from the armor constantly moved and restored his neck. Chun Yeowun’s eyes lit up at the sight.\n‘It has that kind of power?’\nIn the past, he didn’t know of its powers and just handed it over to the leader of the North Sea Ice Palace at the time. However, its abilities were amazing, starting with the neck recovery and the repulsive force.\nIt was outstandingly faithful to the role of thoroughly protecting the owner wearing it.\n‘As long as this is on me, I’m invincible.’\nDan Kyeong-gak exclaimed in confidence.\n“Elders of the Palace! Wake up! If you join hands with the Palace Lord, I’ll even handle the Demon God for you!”\nHe tried to restore the broken morale of his people, as even the elders who saw him in action were shaken.\nHowever, no one could easily move to his side, so until he killed the Demon God, it didn’t seem like they would come to his side.\n‘It’s possible.’\nClearly, the opposing young man was stronger than him, but he had an item with an amazing regenerative power and an energy reflection power.\n‘If I take down the Demon God, everything will go back to normal.’\nWith his inflated hope, Dan Kyeong-gak pointed his finger at Chun Yeowun.\n“Demon God! I bet everything to compete–.”\nShh!\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun moved ahead of him.\n‘!?’\nIt was so quick that he couldn’t even react as Chun Yeowun grabbed the hand that had been pointed at him.\n“Your hands don’t seem to have manners.”\n“\nUgh\n!”\nSince Chun Yeowun was holding his arm too tightly, he screamed as golden lines came out of his armor and slowly penetrated into his shoulder.\nPhhh!\nIt looked like the small wires were trying to stop the arm from falling off and restore his muscles back to their original state.\nAnd when his shoulders stiffened, he thought that his arm was restored and tried to hit Chun Yeowun.\nHowever,\nCrack!\n“\nKuaaak\n!”\nSuddenly, his elbow was torn; although his shoulder was being healed, the entire arm wasn’t able to withstand it.\n‘H-how?’\nAs he had complete faith in his armor, he was flustered. Chun Yeowun’s fist flew towards his face.\n‘Is he aiming for places without armor?’\nHe tried to tilt his head but he couldn't match Chun Yeowun’s speed. In an instant, Chun Yeowun’s fist pierced his face.\nBang!\n“Kuak!”\nThe strong power changed his facial structure and dented his bones. Staggering, Dan Kyeong-gak looked down at his armor.\n‘Why didn’t it work this time?’\n“You don’t seem to understand.”\nChun Yeowun said as he threw away the torn hand.\n“There wasn’t any repulsion because I didn’t use internal energy.”\n“What?”\nChun Yeowun didn’t use any internal energy when he ripped off the arm or hit the face.\nChun Yeowun had superhuman physical strength and was beyond human growth, able to crush people without using internal energy.\n“Should we try again?”\n“Wa-wait…”\n“Wait for what?”\nChun Yeowun kicked his ankle.\nPak! Crack!\n“\nKuaaak\n!”\nThe kick broke his ankle and his body flipped three times in the air before it fell down.\nThud!\nHis eyes widened as he fell. He didn’t expect the fight to happen like this, which was why he was shocked.\nShhh!\nA golden line from the armor slowly moved and healed his broken leg. However, the torn arm couldn’t be regenerated, and only the bleeding was stopped.\n‘Damn it!’\nDan Kyeong-gak’s face hardened when he realized that he wouldn’t win this. His abilities seemed useless so he had no idea how to deal with this monster.\nTak!\nChun Yeowun grabbed his head and said,\n“Unfortunately, the torn arm doesn’t seem to regenerate.”\nThose words shocked Dan Kyeong-gak.\n“Y-You…”\nChun Yeowun smiled at him and put more strength into his hand.\nGrab!\n“Your armor can protect your shoulder, now let’s see how well it protects your head.”\n‘Damn… you!’\nIn Dan Kyeong-gak’s eyes, Chun Yeowun was the devil himself!\nCrack!\n“\nKuaaaak\n!”\nThe lines from the armor secured the neck to prevent it from being pulled, but that caused the entire upper part of the chin to be torn instead.\n‘… Insane.’\nEveryone who saw it turned pale. Once again, they could understand why Chun Yeowun was called the Demon God instead of God.\nPak!\nThe head was torn off as the upper part of the crown fell to the floor. No matter how great the armor’s regenerative power, it couldn’t restore a severed head.\nChachachak!\nDan Kyeong-gak’s heart stopped, making the armor return to the form of a staff.\nShhh!\nThe staff, which had lost its owner, was sucked into Chun Yeowun’s hand. Chun Yeowun, who grabbed it, looked at it.\n“No scratches.”\nChun Yeowun could have easily used an Invisible Sword, Heart Sword, or sword of any attribute from the start, but he decided against it to avoid damaging the staff.\n“Only two more left.”\nIn the end, five of the seven weapons were in Chun Yeowun’s posession.",

It was a situation where all the cult members were dispatched, thinking the people were enemies.\nBut they weren’t enemies. They were none other than the people of the North Sea Ice Palace and clan.\n“Huh.”\nYongchun Group’s Chairman Chun Yu-jang was at a loss for words with the people who filled the entire front ground.\n‘So many.’\nBecause the entire crowd came there and not just the heads of the palace or clan, there was bound to be a large crowd.\nAnd there were so many people watching one place.\n“Ooh! Lord!”\nNorth Sea Ice clan’s Dan Cho-jin and his son Dan Cho-ja were in tears as they bowed their heads and looked at Chun Woo-jin.\n“Please punish us for leaving our home and running away without telling you.”\nDan Cho-jin was weeping out loud. It was the same with Dan Cho-ja.\nChun Woo-jin held up by holding their shoulders and spoke in a heavy voice.\n“It happened because I was lacking; how can I blame you all? Even if it was like this, I am glad I get to see you back.”\n“Lord!”\nAll the executives looked at it with delighted faces. As a result, all the scattered people of the Sky Demon Order gathered at one place.\nFor 27 years, everyone waited for something like this to happen.\n‘What is this! Why am I in tears!’\nAt first, Dan So-young was just watching them. However, she also began to cry after a few moments, so she bowed her head.\n“This looks so good. Lord Chun Ma.”\nMun Ran-yeong was satisfied with the cult’s descendants all back in one place.\nWhen she woke up from hibernation, she was distraught when she heard of the Sky Demon Order being collapsed.\n“It would be great if this continues. Hehe.”\nHu Bong smiled with a nod. In any case, they too met after many hardships.\nThe joy of this moment could be the starting point of another history of the Sky Demon Order.\n“Huh.”\nChun Yeowun was at the back and looked at them. He had no expression on his face, but they all knew he was feeling the same as them.\n‘Is this all organized and well?’\nChun Yeowun felt like the task at hand was finished. He considered it to be fate that he fell into this time zone.\nMaybe it was for him to help.\n‘The remaining variable is MS Group?’\nThe Sky Demon order was no problem.\nBut the MS Group was something that his descendant might have done or created to bring Chun Yeowun back to the original timeline.\nAnd only by solving that would he be able to reach an answer. As the people kept talking, Chun Yeowun moved.\n“Huan Myung-oh.”\n“Yes.”\nAt his call, Huan Myung-oh came out right away. At that, Chun Yeowun looked at the people of the North Sea Ice Palace and clan and said,\n“Find a place for them to live.”\nHuan Myung-oh took a deep breath and said,\n“I obey the orders of Lord Chun Ma!”\nAs soon as the answer fell, the people of the North Sea Ice Palace and clan burst into cheers.\n“Woahhhh!!!”\nNot only them, but even the leaders of other clans too cheered for them.\n“Thank you for showing such grace.”\n“You are so considerate despite us not doing anything.”\nThey were worried about this part since they came here in a hurry. Because the Russian Defense Ministry soldiers had died, they rushed off because of the orders that were given to kill them.\nAmid such cheers, Huan Myung-oh asked Chun Yeowun.\n“My… my lord. But, has their identity and nationality issue been handled well?”\n“Ah… right. Take care of that too.”\n“Ah.”\nHuan Myung-oh let out an empty catch and sigh. Not one, but he had to create a nationality change for nearly 1,500 people.\n‘The merger hasn’t even been finished yet.’\nWill he ever be able to get home on time? But what could he do?\nEven if he weren’t an executive, he would still have to take the clan's responsibility till the end, as he was a proud member of the Sky Demon Order.\n“Everyone, silence.”\nA short word, but everyone went silent at once. As the place turned quiet, Chun Yeowun continued.\n“I heard that the North Sea Ice Palace had been divided into factions for various problems.”\nDan Cho-jin, Dan Cho-ja, and the elders of the North Sea Ice Palace nodded their heads at those words.\nEveryone knew that this issue would be discussed at what happened in Russia.\n“From now on, the clan and Palace will be one. To be precise, in accordance with the cult’s system, the palace will be incorporated into the clan.”\n‘Ahh.’\nAt that, the elders all sighed a little. They had foreseen this to some extent; this was because it was the moment that their history of the Palace would end when they returned to the Sky Demon Order.\n‘Ancestors.’\nThey all felt sorry for their ancestors, but Chun Yeowun wasn’t done yet.\n“And Dan Cho-ja!”\n“Yes, Lord Chun Ma.”\nWhen he was suddenly called out, he stepped out with a puzzled expression.\n“I appoint you as the head of the unified North Sea Ice clan.”\n‘!!!’\nEveryone was shocked at it. Naturally, they all thought that Dan Cho-jin would be their leader.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun appointed someone else.\n“H-How can I…”\nThe surprise was short-lived. He was conscious of his father.\nEven his daughter looked at her grandfather with worried eyes.\n‘Will they two fight now?’\nContrary to their concerns, Chun Yeowun’s following words resolved it.\n“Dan Cho-jin has worked hard as the supreme leader and will continue as an elder, so now you will fulfill your responsibility as a Senior Executive and Elder of the cult.”\n“Ah!”\nTraditionally, the leader and elder had the same roles. However, Chun Yeowun decided that Dan Cho-jin didn’t have the experience to lead the clan.\nInstead, he considered it better to hand it over to his son, who was rational with his judgments.\n“Why is there no answer?”\nPak!\nThe two men knelt at the same time and shouted.\n“We follow the orders!”\nAfter answering that, the father tried to relieve his son’s concern.\n[Cho-ja.]\n[Father]\n[It's your time now. Your father will focus on the Sky Demon Order, so don’t worry and work for the clan.]\nHearing that, Dan Cho-ja was relieved. And felt gratitude towards Chun Yeowun, who recognized his true worth.\nAfter the processing of the North Sea Ice clan, which returned into the Sky Demon Order, all the people were dispersed.\nAfter they left, Chun Yeowun also went somewhere. Baekgi, Mun Ran-yeong, and Hu Bong were also about to go, but they stopped.\nIt was because someone approached them; it was Baek Jong-so, the current head of the Pure Kick clan.\n“Oh, right on time.”\nHu Bong, who noticed him, called him.\n“Jong-so!”\n“Teacher!”\nHu Bong was a teacher of Jong-so by the orders of Chun Yeowun, and that shocked Baekgi.\n“Who is teaching whom?”\nHu Bong frowned at the words and grunted.\n“What? I teach well.”\nAt that, Mun Ran-yeong shook her head.\n‘Ugh, they are back at it again.’\nOf course, although Hu Bong was usually a funny person, it was hard to see him as a teacher with talent, especially as he was teaching Illusion Sword to Bi Mak-heon.\nIt was because Bi Mak-heon was quite skilled already. And teaching martial arts of the same form were taught to earn.\nBut that is different for Baek Jong-so. Hu Bong wasn’t a suitable teacher for him.\n“Enough. Baekgi.”\n“Yes?”\n“Even so, I wanted to introduce him to you.”\nAt Mun Ran-yeong’s words, Baekgi looked at Baek Jong-so puzzled.\nMun Ran-yeong smiled and said.\n“This friend is Baek Jong-so. He is the current leader of the Pure Kick clan.”\n“Pure Kick clan?”\nAt those words, Baekgi’s expressionless face changed.\nHe did want to meet people of the clan in this era. Baek Jong-so, who didn’t seem to know about Baekgi, thought it was right to introduce and bowed his head.\n“Baek Jong-so, the leader of Pure Kick clan.”\n“Leader?”\nBaek Jong-so frowned.\nSeeing that this man was with Mun Ran-yeong, he thought that this man was of a high position and felt a bit uneasy.\n‘Who is he?’\nAs Baek Jong-so was puzzled, Baekgi suddenly swung his foot towards him. At the sudden attack, Baek Jong-so crossed his arms to block the kick.\nPak!\n“\nKuak\n!”\nWoong!\nIt looked like a light kick, but the moment he blocked it, his body flew 10 meters away. Due to the throbbing pain in the wrist, he couldn’t even move.\n‘He is strong.’\nA single blow yet the difference was clearly felt. The person in front of him was a warrior he couldn’t even compare with.\nBaek Jong-so spoke when his pain subsided a little.\n“Excuse me. Why are you suddenly…”\nShh!\nAt that moment, Baekgi who was far seemed to have moved since the form turned blurred. Baekgi was ready to slam this man down into the ground.\nIt was really simple, but the force could be felt.\n“Shit!”\nFlustered, Baek Jong-so hurriedly rotated his body and got up and used his feet. When their feet collided with each other, a pounding sound came out.\nPang!\nBaek Jong-so’s supporting foot in the ground was pushed back and dug into the floor.\nPush!\n“Kuak!”\nA groan escaped from Baek Jong-so’s mouth.\nIt felt like thousands of pounds were crushing him down. Baekgi spoke in an arrogant way.\n“Now you are using your feet.”\n“W-why are you doing his…\nkuak\n!”\nAt that time, Baekgi moved and aimed for Baek Jong-so’s chest.\nBaek Jong-so was hit with a kick. Again, his body bounced back. He couldn’t even hold his form and rolled on the ground.\nThud!\n“\nEuk\n!”\nIt took a long time for him to stabilize himself. At first he was disconcerted by the attack, but he was surprised by the kick which came in.\n‘This is shocking. Were there any clans that used their feet other than the Pure Kick clan in our cult?’\nHe really thought this man was amazing. The simple yet strong movements were inspiring.\nAnd then a voice said.\n“Ha! What greatness in a thousand years.”\nBefore going into hibernation, Baekgi was told by his son that his clan would flourish well for a thousand years. However, coming here, he felt disappointed.\nHe didn’t know the clan would break down this badly. Instead of evolving, it seemed like the clan regressed.\n‘Why is he so disappointed?’\nBaek Jong-so couldn’t understand the man in front of him.\nThat was when Hu Bong spoke.\n“To kick your descendent the moment you see them. Baekgi, seriously.\nTch\n.”\n“Descendant?”\nBaek Jong-so was shocked at what he heard.\nCome to think of it, there was a story he kept hearing whenever he had classes with Hu Bong or Mun Ran-yeong.\n[If Baekgi was here, he would teach you right.]\n[It might be better to ask your ancestor to teach you later.]\nAt that time, the story didn’t strike him. Baek Jong-so, who was shocked, didn’t know what to do.\n“B-By any chance, Ancestor?”\nBaekgi leaned back and spoke in a dissatisfied voice.\n“Unfortunately, yes.”\n‘!!!’\nBaek Jong-so was startled at how Baekgi answered and fell flat on the floor.\n‘How did this happen!’\nHe couldn’t stop his beating heart.\nIn front of him was Baekgi, the 14th Leader of the Pure Kick Clan, the legend of the clan!",

      "content": "Chapter 189: Encounter (2)\nBaeki was nicknamed the Thunder Swift Kick.\nHe was one of the Six Swords and known to be the closest to Chun Yeowun. As the 14th leader of the Pure Kick clan, he was a legendary figure who led the revival of the Sky Demon Order by Chun Yeowun’s side.\nFrom generation to generation, the descendants of the Pure Kick clan continued to respect him; the same with Baek Jong-so, the current leader.\nBaekgi looked at Baek Jong-so, who was bowing on the floor.\n“The legendary—”\n“Shut up!”\nBaek Jong-so went silent at Baekgi’s words. Unlike the others, Baekgi wasn’t fond of his title.\n“Do you want to announce that to everyone here?”\n“N-No!”\nBaek Jong-so shrank from Baekgi’s cold words. His ancestor, the legend himself, had neither a single kind bone in his body nor a soft spoken personality. He was blunt and even colder than Chun Yeowun!\n“Very disappointed. As years passed, we should have progressed forward.”\nBaekgi kept repeating his thoughts. He thought that even if the clan didn’t evolve, it would at least not regress but seeing Baek Jong-so’s skills, he knew that the clan was now a mess.\n“I apologize.”\nThis realization made Baek Jong-so depressed as well. When he was a lot younger, his own father, the leader, had disappeared, so regression of Pure Kick martial arts was inevitable.\nHowever, Baek Jong-so wasn’t the kind to make excuses, so he just let Baekgi continue yelling.\n‘So stubborn.’\nHu Bong shook his head as he looked at Baekgi, who was the most inflexible and blunt among the Six Swords.\nUnlike the others, he had taken a while before being loyal to Chun Yeowun because of his great pride.\n“Yah! It isn’t because he wanted this that…\nugh\n!”\nHu Bong was about to speak up, but Mun Ran-yeong stopped him and whispered,\n“Bong Bong. This is a matter of their clan from now; let them figure it out.”\nShe didn’t think it was right for Hu Bong to intervene, so he obeyed his wife’s words the same way he obeyed Chun Yeowun, stepping back.\nBaek Jong-so couldn’t even raise his head and decided to speak,\n“There is no excuse for this to happen in my time. I am sorry for disappointing you.”\n“Huh.”\nBaekgi snorted, stretching out his hand towards Baek Jong-so and raising him up.\n“Ah!”\nAs soon as he stood up, Baekgi suddenly took a stance, and unfolded each technique without speaking.\nPapah!\nAs each technique unfolded, Baekg Jong-so couldn’t stop his trembling eyes.\n‘This is the…Pure Kick technique?’\nIt was different from what he knew: it seemed too perfect to be changed or improved.\n‘He’s so kind.’\nAt the sight, Mun Ran-yeong smiled. Baekgi was pretending to be cool on the outside, but he was trying to display his clan’s techniques. She clearly understood his intention.\nShk!\nAfter unfolding all 8 forms of the technique, Baekgi adjusted his posture said to Baek Jong-so,\n“Did you see that?”\n“Y-yes!”\nBaek Jong-so answered as he trembled. As a person who practiced the Pure Kick technique daily out of a desire for perfection, Baek Jong-so was amazed to see it in person.\n“It is really amazing.”\n“Stop using your mouth. I’ll give you a day.”\n“Sorry?”\n“If you’re the leader of the clan, then you need to master the techniques I just showed within 12 hours.”\n’12 hours?’\nBaekgi was puzzled about the 12 hours. In actuality, Baekgi’s 12 hours meant 24 hours in the current time; Baek Jong-so’s mission was to master the technique within a day.\n“A-ancestor!”\n“No excuses. If you don’t meet my expectations, I will have to change everything here with my own hands.”\nBaek Jong-so went pale at those words. If Baekgi was up to the task, then he would surely change everything within the clan.\n“Ancestor, can you give me two or three days?”\nHe had only watched it once, so how could he perfect it within a day? It was definitely not an easy task.\nBaekgi flatly refused.\n“12 hours from now.”\n“…”\n“What are you doing standing there all dazed?”\nBaek Jong-so, who was restless, bowed and tried to run to the Yongchun Group practice hall when Baekgi whispered,\n“Don’t let me down.”\nBaek Jong-so, who heard Baekgi, answered with determination,\n“Yes, sir!”\nHu Bong moved closer to Baekgi and tried to say the same thing,\n“Don’t let me down.”\n“What are you doing?”\n“Imitating you.”\n“What?”\nSince it was done in a low whisper, the imitation didn’t sound right, but Mun Ran-yeong was grinning.\n“Is he carrying you or something? ‘Don’t let me down’?”\n“Don’t make it a pun.”\nWhile Hu Bong was making fun of the exchange, Baekgi sounded very displeased.\n“Your words are letting me down.”\nBaekgi lost his calm as veins began to pop on his forehead.\nIn the vice-chairman office of Yongchun Group, the Golden Gumiho who liked to rest on Chun Yeowun’s shoulder turned pale.\n-You are too much.\n“Play with Bi Mak-heon.”\n-He’s tired now.\nDuring Chun Yeowun’s visit to the North Sea Ice Palace, she decided to stay with Bi Mak-heon, who had a horrible time.\n‘Please, not again!’\nBi Mak-heon, too, was shocked at Chun Yeowun’s words. It was no easy task to take care of the fox; despite taking the form of a baby fox, she acted like a monster boss.\n-I’ll be quiet, okay?\nThe Golden Gumiho tried to flatter Chun Yeowun, but he stayed consistent with his decision and refused to change his mind.\n-So cold. Even your ancestor wasn’t this cold.\n“I have no intention to hear any of this from you.”\n-I’ll be doing this, then!\nThe Golden Gumiho pretended to close her ears. It was so cute that even Yu So-hwa smiled. When she looked at the adorable little fox, she forgot it was one of the strongest beasts.\n“Hey! What are you up to? Master told you to get out. Why are you acting so much like a pet?!”\nThe second secretary, Shakena, yelled at the fox. Despite her harsh words, she too wore a pleasant expression while looking at the fox.\nChun Yeowun had called for her because he had something to discuss with them.\n‘Hehe. I’m finally reunited with my master.’\nHowever, the fox didn’t even try to listen to the discussion and wrapped itself around Chun Yeowun’s neck, protesting for her stay.\n-I won’t go! I won’t go!\n“Fine then, I’ll pull you off.”\nShakena reached out for the fox on Chun Yeowun but it used its tail to strike her hand.\nPak!\n“…”\n-You think I’ll leave him alone with a naughty girl like you?!\n“This fox!”\nShakena, who was joking at first, was now angry and sincerely wanted the fox to leave.\n“Animals should act like animals.”\nWooong!\nA golden energy released from the fox. Shocked by the sudden energy, Shakena too released her demonic energy, but something suddenly crushed her from above.\nThud!\n“Ouch!”\nA naked woman sat on her with golden hair and elegance: it was the fox in its human form.\nShakena, who would normally fight back, trembled at the weird energy and the nine tails behind the woman. Chun Yeowun’s eyes lit up.\n‘Her powers are back to normal.’\nIt seemed like after eating the Kraken, she recovered her powers.\nOnly Chun Yeowun would be able to deal with the fully recovered Gumiho.\n“Animal? You bitch.”\nHearing the Gumiho’s voice of bloodlust, Shakena gasped for air. She could clearly feel how overwhelming the Gumiho’s energy was, understanding how disadvantaged she would be if they were to fight.\nChun Yeowun then intervened.\n“I told you that I won’t repeat myself twice.”\n“\nTsk\n.”\nThe Gumiho pouted at his words. Although other people would react differently, she knew that to Chun Yeowun, whether she was in her human or fox form didn’t matter.\nWoong!\nShe quickly changed back into a baby fox and rested herself on Bi Mak-heon’s head.\n“\nEek\n!”\nHolding Bi Mak-heon’s hair as if his hair strands were reins, she said,\n-Go out now. go go!\nShe spoke with a shrill voice. Unfortunately for Bi Mak-heon, he would never be able to control her like Chun Yeowun.\nBi Mak-heon accepted that he was just a human horse to the Gumiho and silently took her out of the room. When they finally left, Shakena approached her master.\n“Oh my, it’s just the two of us, Master.”\n“Don’t push your luck.”\nPak!\nAs she continued to giggle, Chun Yeowun pushed her way and put his hand into a shadow.\nSwoosh!\nHe then pulled something out: a cylinder with a golden pattern on it. Her puzzled expression then became intense and serious.\n“Master, where did you get this from?”\n“Do you know what this is?”\nChun Yeowun handed the cylinder to her. Receiving the object, she was shocked at what she saw.\n‘Does she recognize where it’s from?’\nHe had found the item with Hagar, the traitor, which is why he guessed that the language was from the demon clan.\n“Master, this emblem is of the Grand Duke Kaliaf, one of the 3 Grand Dukes of our clan.”\n“Grand Duke?”\nChun Yeowun was puzzled at the title Grand Duke, as he knew that this title denoted the second-highest rank after the king.\nFrom birth, demons were stronger than humans, so he could fathom how strong someone of that title could be.\n“But why does Master have this?”\nShe wondered.\nNot once had she even seen a Grand Duke class demon in person; the hierarchy of the clan made it so that seeing people of higher titles was tough.\n“I found it in the traitor’s hands.”\n“Hagar?”\nShakena didn’t understand what he was saying. From what she knew, Hagar was a low-level demon.\nIt was strange that he had an object of a higher demon, even more so of Grand Duke Kaliaf.\n“Can I open it?”\n“Go ahead.”\nShe opened it, taking out the scroll from inside that displayed the drawing of the armor set Chun Yeowun was after.\nSeeing the drawing, her eyes widened.\n“Master!”\n“Do you know what that is?”\n“This is… Arisha’s armor.”\n“Arisha’s armor?”\nIt was impossible for Chun Yeowun to understand what she was saying, so she broke it down for him.\n“This armor here is the blueprint for divine items that only the Demon King of the clan can wear.”\n“So this is the Demon King’s treasure?”\nThe secret armor in the scroll that he obtained from Hagar, the traitor, was the Demon King’s treasure.",

      "content": "Chapter 190: Arisha’s Armor (1)\nIn a high mountain peak northeast of Jinan City.\nA being in a cloak hood with arms crossed looking at the dark sky, he was the 4th Guest of MS Group.\nBeside him was a blonde European-dressed man with a unique form. The blonde man carefully spoke to the hooded one.\n“Sire.”\n“Did you get the signal? Marquis Cawl?”\n“No.”\n“Then what is it?”\n“Sire. I am sorry to ask. Do we really need to wait for all the nobles to arrive on this planet? He is strong, but I think that the nobles here can handle him well.”\nThe blonde one called Marquis Cawl asked. At the bottom of the mountain were twelve men and women with exotic forms waiting. All of them belonged to upper Count levels.\n“How about having the other nobles search for the other three of Arisha’s Armor and find the traitor?”\nIn addition to them, there were 30 nobles down here. And all of them were searching for the armor.\nThe only weapon they knew for sure was in the video of MS Group. In the opinion of Marquis Cawl. The hooded one shook his head.\n“The sword is the best treasure of Arisha's Armor. It can be dangerous if the owner of it learns its true powers. It’s better for us to move.”\n“…alright.”\nUnable to disobey the orders, he backed off. Marquis Cawl again picked up some unique-shaped terminal and gave out a signal. But then a sudden beep came from it.\nWoong! Woong! Woong!\nA circle of wavy marks appeared on the screen along with a terminal. It was more like a passage.\n“Sire!”\nMarquis Cawl seemed startled as he called.\nBefore the content was even relayed, the hooded one calmly opened his mouth to speak.\n“… the Gate is open. What is the state?”\n“D-duke title. In addition, more of the many higher ranks seem to be moving.”\nAt those words, the hooded one’s eyes turned sharp.\n“That side has…moved too.”\n“Seems like it. It must be because you have been here for a long time.”\n“We can’t help it.”\n“Then?”\n“Hurry up. Retrieve the sword and helmet right away.”\n“Yes, your grace!”\nIn the Vice-chairman’s office in Yongchun Group.\n“Then the picture on this belongs to the Demon King?”\nShakena nodded her head at the question.\n“As far as I know. In the past, I have seen the Demon King roaming the fields wearing Arisha’s armor during the Third War based on the recordings.”\nAs a demon above Count level, she didn’t have the right to meet the kind, so she only looked at him through videos.\nAt that time, he definitely had this armor on it. Although it was just a video record, the Demon King looked amazing to her eyes.\n“The Demon King wearing Arisha’s Armor was truly a strong person. No one could stand in his way.”\n“What does Arisha mean?”\nHe had been wondering about the word since the first time he came across it. He wondered if it was the name of the one who made it, Shakena answered.\n“Ah… I know that the armor that only a Demon King can wear is Arisha’s.”\n“… so, the meaning?”\n“Ah! Arisha is a great-being worshiped by our clan. In human language… right. It can be God.”\n“God?”\nIn the demon’s language, Arisha meant absolute strength or God.\nChun Yeowun didn’t even think that beings of other planets would even worship someone else. This was because he was too harshly brought up as a member of the Sky Demon Order.\n“Then you will know this too.”\nChun Yeowun touched the armor on the picture with his finger. And when he touched it, the helmet moved like animation and disassembled and changed into a wheel.\n“Ah?”\nShakena was confused and surprised.\n“This was that?”\n“Hm?”\n“I don’t know well. But I have been the Demon King handling various weapons on the battlefield, but this is the first time to see it change.”\n“First time?”\n“Yes.”\nSurprisingly, even Shakena didn’t seem to be aware of it. All she knew was that this armor was a treasure of the Demon King.\nThis time she asked.\n“Master, you said the traitor had it...”\n“Yes.”\nShe hesitated to continue, so Chun Yeowun asked.\n“What is it?”\nPondering a lot, she couldn’t decide.\n‘Can I talk about this?’\nThe information she knew was a clan matter. Everyone was away, but this was the hottest issue in their clan.\n“Answer me.”\n‘After all, Master is a human, so it doesn’t matter if he knows.’\nAt Chun Yeowun’s urging, she spoke.\n“Actually, before I set my foot here, there was a rumor going on in the clan.”\n“Rumor?”\n“Yes. A rumor that someone was behind him. Someone helped Hagar escape and sent him here.”\n“Helped in escape?”\n“Actually, Hagar was considered a traitor for preying on his own kin, but a low-ranking noble would never suddenly turn strong enough to be able to escape.”\nA Gate that allowed one to cross into another plant; it was an important place that only the Marquis-level nobles would protect and guard, but such a thing had fallen into the hands of a traitor way too low in title?\nMany questioned it.\nChun Yeowun, taking the scroll, said.\n“The most suspicious person is the Grand Duke then, the one whose emblem is here.”\nListening to this, he could make a rough guess.\n“Right. Huhu. Master is smart. As you said, Grand Duke Kaliaf is one of the three Grand Dukes and is the one under suspicion.”\n“Why?”\nShe hesitated at the question; she thought talking to Chun Yeowun was fine, but it was a sensitive issue in the clan.\n“… Grand Duke Kaliaf is aiming to be the next Demon King.”\n“Next Demon King?”\nThis confused him. Shakena was here to catch the traitor on the order of the Demon King, so what is this plot twist?\n“Will the Demon King retire?”\n“No, it is a bit more ambiguous.”\n“How?”\n“The Demon King hasn’t appeared in public for a long time.”\n“How long?”\n“Before I was even born.”\nShakean was 820 years old.\n“Hmm?”\n“I heard it has been two thousand years.”\n“Two thousand!?”\nEven Chun Yeowun was shocked. He knew the average lifespan of demons was long, but this was huge.\n‘So they are long-lived ones.’\nAccording to Shakena, no one had seen the Demon King since the Third War that occured two thousand years back.\n“Then who gave you the order?”\n“There are the four Dukes who assist the Demon King. One of them, Sir Ludwig, ordered me.”\n“Huh? And only they see the Demon King?”\n“Yes. They are the only ones who can see him. Other than them, no one had seen the Demon King for years, so they are called unturnable doorknobs.”\n“Doorknobs?”\nA title that wouldn’t stick if the Demon King had come out.\n“The head of the clan hasn’t appeared in public, so…suspicions rose.”\n“…”\nShe didn’t answer Chun Yeowun’s words; it meant agreeing with him.\nThe authority of the Demon King was absolute for the clan, but now they were all wondering if their king was alive or dead.\n“I have a rough idea as to what it is.”\n“Huh?”\n“Normally, the title of authority would be Grand Duke from the Demon King. However, it is said that four Dukes are close to the Demon King and don’t let others see him, which makes it natural for a riot to occur.”\n“Woah… Master. You are so smart!”\nChun Yeowun shook his head at her words. Anyone could guess this much.\n“Right. As Master said, dissatisfaction rose among the Grand Dukes.”\nIt had been two thousand years. Even if they were demons, their head had been missing, so it was natural for the Grand Duke to be discontent with it and aim to be the next one on the throne.\n“Then the four Dukes came and announced the condition for the Demon King.”\n“What is this now?”\n“They said that those who Arisha chose are the only ones to challenge the next title of Demon King.”\nChosen by Arisha.\nIt was as if a member had to be chosen by the god their clan worshiped.\n“What qualification is that?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s question, she pointed to the armor.\n“Arisha’s Armor. It was said that those who find the armor will be given a chance to challenge the Demon King.”\nAuthority fell due to the absence of their King, and the only thing to control the warlike demons and Grand Dukes was the existence of Arisha.\nAnd once the announcement fell, the Grand Dukes rushed to find the armor.\n“Ha!”\nChun Yeowun sighed and said,\n“Now I see it clearly.”\n“Huh?”\n“If Arisha's Armor isn’t found in the end, no one will be eligible to challenge, right?”\n“Right.”\n“Those Dukes close to the King were one smart bunch.”\n“Ah!”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, Shakena understands what happened.\n“If no one can find Arisha’s Armor, the Dukes closest to the King will continue to maintain the power and control the clan.”\n“Right.”\n“What is right?”\n“Even after the announcement, no one had been able to find the armor for decades. Because of that, rumors went around that maybe Arisha’s Armor might not even be on our planet.”\n“So?”\n“The problem was that one couldn’t enter another planet on their wishes without a specific reason.”\nIt was forbidden to use the Gate. The approval had to come from the Demon King.\n“I think I can see why the rumors went that Grand Duke Kaliaf supported the traitors.”\n“There was a reason.”\n“Right! For our clan, preying on a clan member means the culprit should be executed.”\nKilling their own clan members would never be forgiven by them. The traitor who did it managed to cross the Gate and hide in another planet.\nThen, there was a great reason for the demons using the Gate to another planet to catch that traitor.\n“For some reason, it felt really strange that only one person was sent each time.”\nThe Duke closest to them placed a limit on the pursuers, saying that the clan’s power in their planet shouldn’t be wasted to catch a low-level demon despite the contact with the sent demons always getting cut off.\n“It was to make sure that they don’t find the armor.”\nGrunt!\nIn the end, it was a battle between Grand Duke Kaliaf and the Demon King’s men.\nShakena gritted her teeth in anger. Due to these chases, countless demons were sacrificed.\n“There is a power struggle everywhere.”\nChun Yeowun clicked his tongue.\nAnd their power struggle had spread to earth.\n‘If Shakera is right, then Arisha’s Armor must have been with the Duke’s closest aides.’\nIt was likely. Even when looking at what Chun Yeowun saw in the memories, the weapons suddenly fell from the sky, too randomly.\n‘Huh?’\nHowever, Chun Yeowun thought it was strange. Something didn’t feel right.\nIf they hid Arisha’s Armor, it had to be at the time the decree was announced or before it was announced, but the armor fell on earth long before such an announcement had come.\n‘Strange.’\nWhen Chun Yeowun was puzzled at the thought, a small light shone from the cylinder that contained the scroll.\n“What is that?”\nSeeing that, Shakena looked inside the cylinder.\nShe said with a puzzled face.\n“Master…this is a tracker.”\n“Tracker?”\nEven if he had Nano, Chun Yeowun couldn't know what was in it since this was an item of the demons.\nHowever, the question was, why didn’t it react till now?\n“I’ll remove it right away.”\nShe put her hand into it and tried to remove it.\nIt was then…\nShhhh!\nSuddenly, the space shook in the room, and numerous people appeared.\nShaken was taken aback and quickly moved at the sudden appearance. In an instant, 50 beings appeared in the Vice-Chairman’s room, all demons.\n“This…”\nShakena couldn’t hide her shock as she looked at one of them.\n“D-Duke!”\nThe white-haired man with the most splendid armor among the demons was the highest-ranking being with only ten demons obtaining the title.\nIt was the Duke.",

      "content": "Chapter 191: Arisha’s Armor (2)\nOther than Chun Yeowun, Shakena wasn’t scared of anyone else in the room.\nShe was outstandingly warlike, yet she trembled in the Duke’s presence.\nShe then noticed two beautiful white-haired men and women standing on either side of Duke.\n‘Marquis Irene and Marquis Isaac!’\nJust looking at those two, she could figure out who this Duke was: Duke Bevman, known as the White Storm, who was Grand Duke Kaliaf’s right-hand man.\n‘Shit.’\nShe couldn’t even understand this. Two of the Duke’s men were Marquis and 20 of the 50 people were of Counts; it was no exaggeration to say that an enormous amount of monsters had gathered here.\n‘Master?’\nShe looked at Chun Yeowun, who was still seated in the chair with his legs crossed and looked at the demons, acting very relaxed.\nAt that moment, the white-haired woman next to the Duke, Marquis Irene, opened her mouth,\n“Papa, I think this is the right place.”\nIn her hand was a unique shaped terminal. When a beep sounded from the terminal, she suddenly looked at the cylinder on the table.\n“There it is.”\nIn response, Marquis Isaac, who was to the Duke’s left, said,\n“I knew it, Hagar\ndid\nsteal it.”\nWith that, he looked at Shakena,\n“Is this your doing, Heart Hunter?”\nAs a woman known to be the strongest of the Counts, she was recognized at once.\n“M-marquis.”\nChun Yeowun smiled at her timid character; it seemed like titles mattered profusely to demons. Seeing Shakena act so carefully was pleasant. On the other hand, Marquis Isaac looked at Chun Yeowun and raised his eyebrows.\nA demon then came out from the crowd.\n“Smiling? A trivial human is\nsmiling\nat us?”\nHaving said that, the demon clenched his fist and approached Chun Yeowun to showcase the difference in power.\nMarquis Irene suddenly spoke,\n“Stop right there.”\n“Huh?”\nAt those words, the demon paused and someone broke through the floor and appeared.\nBang!\n“Who dares to enter my Lord’s place without permission!”\nIt was Hu Bong, who had a flaming sword in his hand. If he had walked another step closer, the demon would have been attacked.\nTak!\nTwo more people climbed up from the hole in the floor: Mun Ran-yeong and Baekgi.\n‘I knew it.’\nIn the elevator they felt the numerous presences. Originally, demons couldn’t be felt, but since Baekgi had a suit made by the MS Group, even the smallest changes in energy could be detected.\nPak!\nThe two came up and stood beside Chun Yeowun, but that wasn’t the end.\nBang!\n“Lord Chun Ma!”\nEven Bi Mak-heon pushed into the door along with the other two secretaries, and even his disciple, Ark Young, came in.\n-Rats have come.\nThe Golden Gumiho, who sensed something, told them and, thanks to her, they all entered the room right away.\nIn an instant, the situation became a huge confrontation. For the demons, however, humans were seen as bugs or livestock.\nThe demon who had tried to hit Chun Yeowun shook his head and stepped forward again.\n“Whose safety are these bug-like humans–”\nSlash!\n“\nKuak\n!”\nHu Bong’s sword met his throat before he could finish speaking. The bewildered demon had tried to avoid it, but Hu Bong’s sword split into five and stabbed him in the neck, shoulder and thighs simultaneously.\nTak!\nSince his upper body turned into stone, the hit was avoided, but both thighs were stabbed with the sword, causing him to fall back.\n“\nEuk\n!”\nThe other demons looked at him without moving.\nThey all knew that this human was strong. One of the demons at the Count level came out laughing,\n“Seriously. This is why you aren’t able to rank up.”\nThe demon who was hit by Hu Bong had the Viscount title. Then, a white light flashed from the Marquis Irene’s left eye as she said,\n“Zakun, this isn’t your opponent either.”\n“Huh? What is that supposed to mean, Marquis?”\n“Your fighting power is 58,000. The red-haired man is at 98,000.”\nHearing her words, Marquis Isaac was shocked.\n“Is that true?”\n“Are you doubting my ability?”\nIrene’s power was ability numericalization: the ability to analyze opponents and read their combat power.\nIt was extremely accurate because it analyzed the body’s internal body.\n“Pretty good for a human.”\nShe was curious about Hu Bong, who had a higher power level than most of the demons. As soon as saw him, she looked at the powers of the others as well.\nThe first thing that caught her eye was Shakena’s.\n“105,000? Heart Hunter, are you stronger than before?”\nThe last time she saw Shakena, her power level was 60,000, which alone was considered the highest number at the Count level. Then, she looked at Mun Ran-yeong.\n“190,000?”\n“What?”\nAt her words, Marquis Isaac’s eyes lit up. Since they were siblings, Isaac knew his sister’s ability well.\n“A human with 190,000 fighting power?”\nThe highest ranked Count had a fighting power of 100,000.\nTaking that into account, this human exceeded the top Count. At this level, she could be a lower Marquis too.\nBut what was surprising was the next person.\n‘320,000?’\nConfirming Baekgi’s power, she couldn’t announce it. This was insane even at the Marquis level; her brother also had a fighting power of 320,000 and was in the upper-middle-ranking.\nNumbers were just numbers and things could change in combat, but this man was on par with Isaac. However, she didn’t say it because it would hurt her brother’s pride.\n“Enough.”\nDuke Bevman stopped her with a heavy voice.\n“Ah, Papa.”\nHer left eyes turned to analyze Duke Bevman’s power.\n2.89 million. Overwhelming strength.\nImmensely different from those at the Marquis level; no matter how strong humans were, they would never be able to defeat this man.\n‘In front of Father, humans are just trash.’\nThe cruel reality was that the Duke could crush all of them alone.\n“We didn’t come to do that.”\nWith that, he looked at Chun Yeowun.\n“Human. You seem to be the head of this place. Give me the explanation for why the item that should be with Hagar is with—”\n‘!?’\nAs he talked, Duke Bevman looked up. Then,\nKwakwakwang!\nThe building shook with a loud roar. Eventually, the ceiling was pierced and someone broke into the room. With her left eye, Irene couldn’t see the people but saw numbers signifying their power.\n[2,830,000]\n[286,000]\nHer face hardened. The moment she saw the numbers, she knew exactly who these intruders were.\n“Papa!”\n“I know.”\nPhat!\nHearing her cry, Duke Bevman moved.\nHe rushed to greet the newcomers, who had incredible fighting power and intruded as fast as lightning. He just swung his fist, and caused the wind to push forward.\nChachacha!\nThe forty windows in the vice-chairman’s office shattered. The demons and even Chun Yeowun’s subordinates were pushed back from the wind pressure.\nPrrr!\nDuke Bevman’s fist was blocked by the intruder.\nFlutter!\nThe wind revealed the face of the intruder who blocked Duke Bevman’s fist. Shakena saw the black-haired, tall, and exotic-looking man with his hood removed and yelled,\n“Duke Ludwig!”\nDuke Ludwig.\nHe was one of the four Dukes who was under the Demon King. Next to him was a blonde man in blue European clothing, Marquis Cawl.\nTheir appearance made the demons become alert. Since a strong man on the same level as Duke Bevman appeared, they were no longer hostile.\n“So you were here, Duke Ludwig.”\nDuke Ludwig didn’t respond to the words and looked at Chun Yeowun, who was still sitting in his seat, and said,\n“Human, do you have Arisha's Armor with you?”\nDuke Ludwig was only interested in whether or not the weapons had gone into the demons’ hands.\nThe Grand Duke’s men had shown up sooner than expected, so he was becoming impatient.\n“Arisha’s Armor?”\nAll of the demons were now interested in the confrontation because their purpose was Arisha's Armor too.\n“I see. So you have them, human.”\nDuke Bevman looked at Chun Yeowun. His white eyes grew even colder.\nDuke Bevman lifted his fist and tried to hit him.\nBut,\n“No!”\nGrab!\nDuk Ludwig exerted a strong force to restrain Duke Bevman from moving before shouting his children and men,\n“Catch him!”\n“Yes, your grace!”\nPhat!\nMarquis Irene, who received the order, moved.\nAs a demon with the Marquis title, she had amazing speed. Unless, of course, someone interfered.\nPak!\nSomeone predicted Marquis Irene’s path in advance and blocked it. It was none other than Marquis Cawl, Duke Ludwig’s right-hand man.\nMarquis Irene chuckled at his interference.\n“I knew you would try to stop me.”\nWhen she reached out her hand, spider web-like substance was spewed out from her 10 fingers.\nSince he was too close, Marquis Cawl was swept up in the web.\n“Shit!”\nPang!\nWhen Marquis Cawl was forced to use his ability, Marquis Irene bounced back.\n‘He’s much stronger than me.’\nHer own fighting power was 280,000; in terms of numbers, it was small, especially against Marquis Cawl who was the best.\nBut that didn’t matter because he wasn’t her target.\nSwoosh!\n“You!”\nMarquis Cawl noticed Isaac pass by him and tried to move, but Isaac was already in front of the sofa.\n“Come here—”\nPapak!\n“\nKuak\n!”\nSomeone kicked Isaac in the face. He was then hit in the shoulder, then the face, and then a couple more places. He staggered back from the successive kicks.\nThe one who kicked him was Baekgi.\n‘He is able to handle Invisible Kicks?’\nBaekgi was shocked by Marquis Isaac’s resistance, as he was only lightly pushed.\nBaekgi, who was in his best condition, used his Invisible Kicks, but instead of being torn apart, his opponent was intact.\n“How dare you, human!”\nFull of anger from being hit in the face, Isaac turned to Baekgi. As a result, the demons under Duke Bevman began to move.\n“Attack!”\n“Only that one needs to be caught!”\nThey, too, were aware that Chun Yeowun was the one they had to catch.\n“Who would dare to aim for my Lord?!”\nAs the demons moved, Hu Bong and the others stepped ahead of Chun Yeowun. This was the moment when the vice-chairman’s office turned into a warzone.\nChun Yeowun, seeing everything unfold, slowly got up.\n“Human, run out!”\nDuke Ludwig, who thought that Chun Yeowun wouldn’t win, shouted.\nOutside the office were demons who were under his control, and he figured that if the human left, his demons would be able to handle the situation and recover Arisha's armor/weapons.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun didn’t care about the pandemonium.\n“This is so funny. You all come into\nmy\nrealm and act however you want.”\nHearing Chun Yeowun’s words, the demons wondered what he was saying. Chun Yeowun declared,\n“Kneel.”\n‘!?’\n“Before I finish counting down from three.”\nOne of the Count demons who thought his declaration was absurd shouted,\n“What nonsense are you spewing? Ha—”\nGrab!\n“\nKuak\n!”\nThe Count who was shouting suddenly grabbed his core as the other demons didn’t understand what was happening.\n“What’s happening with you?”\n“\nAck\n! My core…”\nThe core was the main weakness. If the core was damaged, the demon would die.\nChun Yeowun clenched the air in front of him.\n“\nKuaaaak\n!”\nSwish!\nBlack smoke rose from the Count's mouth as he crumbled into ashes. The others couldn’t hide their shock. Chun Yeowun said,\n“Three.”\nThe countdown started. The two Dukes who were fighting thought this was absurd.\nThe humans, who were supposed to be insects compared to the demons, suddenly intervened and were able to control the flow of the war.\nDuke Ludwig shouted,\n“Human, we don’t have time for this! I can’t figure out what you’re thinking, but right now—”\nWoong!\n‘!?’\nChun Yeowun’s body emitted a black haze: Sky Demon Energy.\nAs he gradually raised his energy, more Sky Demon Energy was being released.\nEven Duke Ludwig couldn’t speak as the ferocious energy flowed out, which only made the demons more scared.\n“Two.”\n‘!?’\nChun Yeowun kept counting. Hearing the next number, Isaac, whose pride was hurt, screamed as he ran,\n“How dare you, human trash!”\n“Huh?”\nShh!\n“Uh?”\nBeakgi, who confronted him, tried to stop Marquis Isaac from going any farther, but Marquis Isaac’s body disappeared. Marquis Isaac, who had the ability to move through space, was the one who brought the demons into this office.\nIsaac disappeared and appeared behind Chun Yeowun.\nShhh!\n“This is the price for not fearing us and—”\nSwish!\nIsaac’s hand sliced through the air, which was suddenly empty. Chun Yeowun, who had been in front of him moments before, disappeared in an instant as someone grabbed Marquis Isaac’s head from behind.\nGrab!\n“\nKuak\n!”\nHe tried to turn his head and see who was holding him, but he couldn’t even move. He tried to move through space again, but,\nWoong!\n“Huh?”\nHis body, which should have moved, didn’t budge, as if it were fixed to this one point in space.\nThis meant that the person holding his head was also controlling the fabric of space and had interfered with his movement.\n‘How?’\n“You seem to want to die quickly.”\nThe voice was Chun Yeowun’s. Bewildered, Marquis Isaac tried to counterattack as best as he could.\nAt that moment,\nCrush!\nHis head was blown off by a tremendous force, and he didn’t even have a chance to scream.\nThe demons were at a loss of words when they saw a Marquis-level demon taken down so easily.\n‘No way!’\n‘M-Marquis Isaac?’\nAlong with his sister, Isaac was known to be strong enough to be the next Duke.\nHis death was enough to ruin the demons’ pride. Chun Yeowun looked at them once more and said,\n“The last chance. The last number: one.”\nAnd he finished counting.\nKukukuku!\nAs soon he finished, there was tremendous pressure which distorted the space and crushed down the demons in the office.\nThe pressure was so strong that all the demons were forced to kneel at the same time.\n“\nEuk\n!”\n“\nGasp\n!”\nThud! Thud! Thud!\nThey were all kneeling against their will. Their strength was too weak to withstand the force Chun Yeowun was exerting, and the only demons left standing were Shakena and the two Dukes.\n‘How can a human have this much power?’\nThe Dukes thought the same idea.\nMarquis Irene, who was also forced to kneel, opened her mouth with a shocked face,\n“Pa… Papa…”\nDuke Bevman looked at her with a puzzled face as she spoke in a terrified voice,\n“T-that man’s…power is…close to…10 million.”",

      "content": "Chapter 192: Arisha’s Armor (3)\nMarquis Irene’s left eye could see one’s power level.\nRight now, she is looking at Chun Yeowun’s power.\n[9,650,000]\nHis power level was so high; it was almost 10 million.\n‘N-No way could this happen….’\nThe first person she looked at using her ability was Chun Yeowun. At that time, the number was strangely low. It was 10, which was usually the case for ordinary humans.\n‘He hid his power….’\nThe first thing that surprised her was this. Her abilities were entirely accurate. Even if one tried to hide it, her ability would still figure it out. However, that didn’t happen this time.\n‘Just what power is….’\nThe second surprise was his overwhelming power that completely surpasses humans—a figure that slightly exceeded the 10 Dukes of the clan.\n“Irene! Did you really see it correctly?”\nDuke Bevman asked in a voice of disbelief. He really thought that she was wrong. However, Marquis Irene couldn’t say anything more.\n‘At this number, it might be comparable to the Grand Duke.’\nShe once had an audience with Grand Duke Kaliaf, a demon higher than her father. Unable to contain her curiosity, she used her ability. He almost caught her, but she saw it go over 9.99 million in a brief moment.\nWhen the number exceeds 1 million, it usually increases slowly one after another, like a timer.\n“Hah!”\nPapak!\nDuke Bevman unexpectedly and violently pushed Duke Ludwig away. Duke Ludwig, who is in a daze by Chun Yeowun’s power, couldn’t stop him.\nDuke Bevman, who pushed him away, moved towards Chun Yeowun.\nPhat!\n“I don’t know what you did, but there’s no way a human being can have such power!”\nDuke Bevman could never admit it.\nHumans had been nothing but bugs and insects to their clan since ancient times. Now, such a bug was more powerful than him?\nWheik!\nA sharp wind blew from Duke Bevman. Although the place was small, he was aiming for a close range, and he made sure that his power wouldn’t touch his demons, and only Chun Yeowun’s subordinates were affected by it.\nKwakwakwang!\nIt ripped apart the ceiling and floor.\nThe moment came that he was about to hit Chun Yeowun…\n- yah!\nA sharp cry was heard.\nSomething huge and golden obscured his vision.\nWheik!\nDuke Bevman tried to strike the golden light, but it instantly neutralized his power. The golden light stopped everything and prevented any aftermath from the room.\nPapak!\nThen the golden light that neutralized the attack wrapped around him so fast that he couldn’t even respond.\n“\nKuak!\nW-what is this?”\nIt wrapped around Duke Bevman like a rope. He thought it felt weird.\n‘Hair?’\nWhat wrapped around him was golden hair. The already surprised Duke Bevman then heard a woman’s voice.\n“Now you’re trying to touch my Chun Ma?”\nHe looked where the voice came from. It was from a naked woman with golden hair. Her arms were folded, and she looked at him arrogantly. She was the Golden Gumiho.\n‘This woman?’\nThe weird energy which humans couldn’t possess. The Golden Gumiho looked at him with narrowed eyes and warned.\n“If you don’t yield to Chun Ma, I will eat you.”\nGrunt!\nDuke Bevman’s face distorted. He had power over demons.\nAnd this one wants him to bow?\nHe yelled furiously.\n“Eat? How dare you try to spout such things to a Duke who is higher than your race?!”\nGoooo!\nThe Duke’s power increased. Something resembling human blood was coming up to his face disgustingly.\nSeeing that, even the faces of the demons who were kneeling tensed.\n“They spoke the wrong words.”\n“You made him awaken. Idiots.”\nIt can be said that they were already more robust than humans. But awakening helps them be twice powerful.\nTutu!\nTwo long horns sprouted from the forehead of the Duke. The reason people call them demons was because of this awakening.\nDuke Bevman, whose skin was turning white, spoke coldly.\n“Woman. You made a huge mistake. The awakened Duke’s power is too strong. A lower race like you can never….”\nCrack!\n“\nKuaaaak\n!”\nBefore he could even finish speaking, the golden hair wrapping around the body of Duke Bevman tightened. Her power was so strong that only a scream came out of the Duke’s mouth.\n‘H-how is this possible?’\nDuke Bevman couldn’t understand it. He tried to rip off the tail, but the more he tried, the tighter it got.\n“\nKuaaak\n!”\nHis face contorted in pain. Marquis Irene, who couldn’t look at him suffering like that, was in disbelief.\n“H…how is this? Even if it was like that….”\nThe number that her left eye sees contains the fighting power of the Golden Gumiho.\n[6,830,000]\n‘How…’\nShe was at a loss for words as the power exceeded the Duke's.\nShe didn’t know that this wasn’t the full power of the golden fox. How would she react when the fox turns into her original form, which is more powerful than her current form?\nShhh!\nBlack smoke flowed out from the mouth of Duke Bevman. It seemed like just a bit more push, and he would die.\n“Pa… Papa.”\nIrene helplessly called for him. She visited earth several times but never once had she seen such monsters.\nThe fox who lived from ancient times and Chun Yeowun who had exceeded the level of humans…\nThey were all unimaginable beings on Earth!\n“That is enough.”\nChun Yeowun stopped the Golden Gumiho that was going to kill the Duke.\n“Why? It isn’t done yet. He is so cheeky. I need to kill him.”\n“There are things I need to hear from him.”\nAt those words, the Gumiho smacked her lips.\n“This one sure is lucky. Let’s meet later.”\nShhh! Thud!\n“\nKuak\n!”\nShe pulled back her tail, and the Duke fell like a doll. After his awakening ended, he was back to his normal state, and he seemed too shocked at what happened as he lost his will. His awakening was useless.\n“And now you.”\nChun Yeowun looked at Duke Ludwig.\nThis Duke was also standing except for Shakena, who wasn’t forced to kneel.\nShakena looked at them with a puzzled expression.\n‘What now?’\nOne side was someone who assisted the Demon King, and the other side was the master she swore allegiance to. It was hard to choose.\n“Mast…”\n“Stay silent.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, she realized that she should never involve herself until this matter was resolved.\nDuke Ludwig, who was being vigilant, spoke.\n“This is extraordinary. I never thought there could be a strong man among humans other than\nhim\n.”\n‘Him?’\nChun Yeowun’s eyes shone.\nThen this demon meant that there was\nsomeone\nlike him around?\nDuke Ludwig continued.\n“Human potential isn’t less to the clan—a being who doesn’t live for more than a hundred years to be so strong.”\nHe genuinely admired Chun Yeowun, and he even praised the Golden Gumiho.\nIt was because the Golden Gumiho even made the proud Duke Bevman aghast.\n“Stop saying such things.”\nWith that, he lifted his sleeve.\nChachacha!\nThe black wrist guard on his wrist disassembled and changed into the shape of a sword. It was the Sky Demon Sword.\nDuke Ludwig’s eyes twinkled after seeing the transformation.\n“Arisha’s Sword!”\nThe reason he showed interest was simple; it was because this was the best sword among the seven weapons of Arisha.\n“Do you know this sword?”\n“Yes.”\n“Then tell me everything you know so I can spare you.”\nAt those words, Duke Ludwig’s eyes sharpened.\nHe was one of the four powerful demons.\nDuke Ludwig’s pride was greater than Duke Bevman's. However, he didn’t lose his cool because of everything he had witnessed.\n“Human. It is a treasure of our clan.”\n“I know that much.”\n“Then you must know that it isn’t something which should be here, right?”\n“I don’t think so.”\n“What?”\n“It is something which came into my possession… and this sword isn’t Arisha’s Sword that you say; this is the Sky Demon Sword, a sacred item of our cult.”\nAt that, Duke Ludwig thought it was absurd.\n“You are too much.”\n“Should I show it to you?”\nThe atmosphere was so intense that a battle could happen at any time. Everyone who witnessed it gulped and stayed silent while watching, not wanting to be involved.\nDuke Ludwig looked at the gumiho and then at Chun Yeowun. He was analyzing the situation.\nThe fact that he was analyzing despite seeing what happened meant that there was something else he could use. Then he spoke.\n“Human, I will make an offer.”\n“Offer?”\n“If you give me that treasure, I will grant you what you want—for example, dealing with the things which currently control the sky on earth or goods worth 10 million gold. Or prolong life? Whatever it is, I will listen.”\nDuke Ludwig tried to make a deal. Even if there was a chance to fight, he didn’t want to get into it.\nTo which Chun Yeowun said with a smile.\n“Is that so? Then, will you all swear allegiance to me? If you say yes, then I will think about it.”\n“What?”\nThis time, Duke Ludwig’s expression hardened. He tried to take a peaceful way out, but this human kept pulling his leg.\nIn a low tone, he asked.\n“Are you looking for a bloodbath?”\n“Things without blood shouldn’t say such things.”\nGrunt!\nThe more the talks went, the angrier he turned. He really did want to avoid getting into a fight, but it seemed like this human was asking for it.\n“You are overconfident about your strength.”\n“It isn't overconfidence; it is reality.”\n“\nSigh.\n”\nDuke Ludwig sighed and took a deep breath not to lose his composure.\nHe spoke as he clenched his fists.\n“I admit that you are strong. However, there is a saying in the world that there is a sky above the sky. Do you know why I, a Duke, am assisting the Demon King?”\n“Should I even know it?”\n“… I’ll tell you. When demons of Marquis level or higher will awaken, that awakening will double the power.”\n“So?”\n“Awakening isn’t the end.”\nWith that, Duke Ludwig spread out his palm and covered his face. At that moment, a tremendous wind pressure arose.\nCrack!\nSo strong that even cracks formed in the building.\n“You crossed a line you shouldn’t have. Us four Dukes obtained the power to advance to a second awakening from the Demon King. That power…”\nHe lifted the hand which covered his face. And his face changed into a different one.\nThis was different from the human form; it is also different from the awakened body of a demon.\nThe nose, hair, eyebrows, everything to define a human face had disappeared except for the red eyes and the mouth.\nDuke Ludwig, who had a bizarre change, raised his mouth into a smile and said.\n“We are of Grand Duke level.”\nWoong!\nThe entire building shook as if an earthquake was happening right below it.\n“Ahh!”\nMarquis Irene couldn’t take off her trembling eyes. She was at a loss of words at Duke Ludwig’s power.\n‘Twelve million!’\nThe rise in power was exponential. She thought he would be so powerful since he assisted the Demon King, but not this much.\n‘Is this why no one recklessly touched the Grand Dukes?’\nNow they realized why no one went against them.\n‘Phew.’\nDuke Ludwig stared at Chun Yeowun.\nHe couldn’t hold it any longer since he was angry. Although he spoke with pure confidence, he wasn’t confident enough to control this power because it wasn’t a natural strength of a Grand Duke; this was just a temporary boost.\n‘Need to finish this in 10 minutes.’\nThat was it. With this power, he wasn’t scared of failing.\n“Human. You will have to do your best. Even I cannot control this power….”\nCreepy!\nIn an instant, he weirdly felt chills in his body.\nSlash!\n‘!?’\nSuddenly, something passed through his neck.\nIt was a very sharp sense and so quick that no one recognized it.\nA black line appeared on Duke Ludwig’s neck.\n“Kua…th…this…. What…”\nBewildered, he tried to hold his shaky neck with both hands. He couldn’t even understand what had happened to him.\nChun Yeowun said.\n“I did my best just as you asked.”\nThen there was the scream which seemed to tear everything apart.\n“\nKYYAAKKKK\n!”\nMarquis Irene, who was witnessing this scene, screamed as her left eye suddenly burst.",

      "content": "Chapter 193: Arisha’s Armor (4)\nHumans bleed when they are injured.\nHowever, when demons are wounded, black smoke comes out from the loss of their demonic energy. Black smoke was quickly coming out from Marquis Irene’s left eye.\n“Ahh…”\nThe reason why her eye suddenly burst was quite simple: because she was using her left eye to analyze others’ power levels, it must have been overloaded.\n‘\nN-No way!’\nThe pain was only for a brief moment, but she felt lost when Chun Yeowun swung his sword.\nIn that brief moment, the number her eye displayed had risen extraordinarily, and it was impossible to even see where the number ended.\n‘Is this the potential of humans?’\nThe demons knew that some humans were strong.\nHowever, a human this strong completely surpassed their beliefs.\n‘This one is a monster.’\nShe recognized that they had touched something they shouldn’t have, and the other demons realized this as well.\nEven if they didn’t have Irene’s ability, they could tell that Chun Yeowun was a monster.\n‘Our strongest demon was defeated in just one slash?’\n‘What had just happened?’\nFor the demons, Awakening, or Advanced Awakening, was like an unreachable dream.\nIt was a symbol of power that only the strong ones had the privilege of undergoing, and it was seen as a broken power.\nThe demons’ gazes didn’t move from Duke Ludwig.\n“\nAck\n!”\nHe was still holding his neck with both hands.\nFor a high-ranking demon, especially one at his level, if the core wasn’t damaged, there was a good chance that stabilizing the neck would help enable and boost recovery.\nBut,\n‘I-I can’t regenerate.’\nDuke Ludwig wasn’t recovering. Not only did a sharp sensation pass through him, but a ferocious energy also seemed to interfere with his natural regeneration process.\nThis energy was none other than the Sky Demon Energy.\nDuke Ludwig, gripped by his fear of death, shouted,\n“\nKuak\n…you…what the hell did you do?”\nChun Yeowun responded with a smile,\n“Don’t act stupid. You’re already dead.”\n‘!?’\nChung Yeowun seemed to know that Duke Ludwig’s body was failing to regenerate and approached the flustered demon.\n“Ah! I almost forgot.”\n“What?”\nPuak!\n“\nKuak\n!”\nChun Yeowun stuck his sword right through the center of Duke Ludwig’s chest. A blue light shone from the Sky Demon Sword as an eerily gloomy energy was released.\n“Y-You?”\nDuke Ludwig’s eyes widened.\nAs one of the four close aides of the Demon King, he was well aware of the abilities of Arisha’s sword.\nWhy was Arisha’s sword known as the best?\nSimply because of its ability to absorb the enemy’s abilities without a cost.\n‘My strength? My—’\n“Thank you. I almost missed the chance to take it, but this was only possible because you endured for so long.”\n“You bastard!”\nDuke Ludwig was furious at Chun Yeowun, but his anger didn’t last for much longer.\n“\nAckkk\n!”\nHis body scattered like ashes in the wind as he could not help but feel hopeless about his impending doom.\nShhh!\nThen, Chung Yoewun’s eyes trembled from the process of transforming information from the demon’s core into his mind.\nEach time he did this, he always faced a familiar dizziness.\n‘What impossible strength.’\nShakena couldn’t take her eyes off Chun Yeowun. She knew that he was strong, but this was beyond her imagination.\nShe never thought that one of the Demon King’s four close aides would lose their life from a single slash.\nGulp!\nShe gulped in fear. Once again, she realized that she had made the right choice.\nAt that moment, Hu Bong yelled at the demons,\n“Hey, what are you going to do? All your leaders are done for, are you going to sit there looking dazed? Surrender now!”\nThe energy forcing them to kneel dissipated, but the demons were too stunned by what they had just witnessed to move.\nWhisper\n.\nThey all looked at each other when a demon suddenly shouted,\n“A-according to the laws of my clan, Count Norin will admit defeat now! Everything will be for the winner. Either take my life or turn me into a slave, anything as you will!”\nIt was the first declaration of defeat.\nNorin, a Count class who had lost his will to fight, surrendered. He confirmed Chun Yeowun’s overwhelming power right in front of his eyes. As Hu Bong said, if their leaders couldn’t do anything, what could\nthey\ndo?\nShikaran, another Count class demon, was dumbfounded by Count Norin’s surrender.\n“What are you spewing—”\n“According to the laws of my clan, Count Olga will admit defeat now! Everything will be for the winner. Either take my life or turn me into a slave, anything as you will!”\nEven before Count Shikaran could finish his rebuke, another Count level demon surrendered.\n“Y-You guys…”\nWhen two of his fellow demons surrendered, he was perplexed. They had gotten up and formally declared their surrender without any care.\n“What are you all doing? How can he the—”\n“Then do you plan to just die here? How do you plan on taking down a monster that defeated our Duke level leaders?”\n“Th-that…”\nHe couldn’t think of anything to refute the statement.\nDuke Bevman had lost his fighting spirit and had no chance of winning. All the demons had already bowed their heads and declared surrender, except for three.\nShhh!\nMarquis Irene’s eye was slowly recovering while Duke Bevman was looking at Chun Yeowun with a puzzled face.\nLastly, Marquis Cawl, Duke Ludwig’s faithful servant, was still in shock.\nUnlike the other demons, these three were bound by blood or had been loyal for a long time and thus weren't in a situation to surrender just because the opponent was strong.\nCrack!\n‘This…this human!’\nMarquis Cawl, who had lost his master, grunted in anger.\nHis master, his lord, had died right before his eyes, and he couldn’t even do anything. He glared at Chun Yeowun as if he wanted him dead.\nChun Yeowun shook his head.\n‘Now is my chance!’\nHe thought that this would be the only chance he would get to kill the man, and he considered the opportunity even more.\n‘He is absorbing the power from the core.’\nEven Marquis Irene saw this as her last chance. The gap between them and Chun Yeowun would send them straight to hell. Other than now, they would never even get close to Chun Yeowun.\nPhat!\nIt was a very clever thought. The two Marquis with the same intention moved simultaneously.\nPhat! Crack!\nBoth of them awakened at the same time as they leapt towards Chun Yeowun.\n‘I need to kill him!’\n‘I need you dead!’\nBut,\nWheik!\n“\nEuk\n!”\n“\nAck\n!”\nTheir bodies were stopped in mid-air by a golden tail that curled around their bodies.\n‘This is?’\nThe Golden Gumiho had stopped them. The two Marquis' who didn’t think about the other monster were too hasty and ended up getting caught.\n“What are you doing? You guys must really have a death wish.”\nA weird killing intent emanated from the golden Gumiho.\n“Damn it!”\n“Pa…papa.”\nThe two demons seemed desperate to avoid such futile deaths, as they would die without having accomplished much. Then, Chun Yeowun spoke.\n“Interesting.”\n“Chun Ma?”\nThe golden Gumiho, who was about to crush them with her tail, turned to Chun Yeowun.\nHe smiled with a strange expression, which the Gumiho didn’t understand.\nAs she wondered what he was up to, Chun Yeowun opened his mouth.\n“So, you received this from the Demon King?”\nChun Yeowun raised his hand towards his face, and as he covered his face with his palm, something amazing happened.\nGuguguuuuu!\nThe room began to shudder. The same phenomenon that happened when Duke Ludwig was transforming occurred.\nHowever, it seemed like with each second, the force shaking the room became stronger.\nCrack!\nTo the extent where their surrounding space was distorted.\nKwaang!\nThe building couldn’t withstand the shaking and seemed as if it would collapse at any moment.\nSwoosh!\nThe tails of the Golden Gumiho expanded in an instant to support the building, which was on the verge of collapsing. If she had been a second later, the floors would have collapsed.\n“Chun Ma!”\nShe shouted at Chun Yeowun, who was unable to control his new power.\nHowever, the distorted space soon turned normal and the tremendous energy that had threatened everyone moments earlier began to subside.\nTo be precise, it was coalescing at one point.\n“W-what is that? Chun Ma?”\n“Lord!”\nThe Golden Gumiho and the other subordinates under Chun Yeowun couldn’t hide their shock. Chun Yeowun’s entire body seemed to be enveloped in raging flame.\nThose flames around his body were flames of pitch black darkness. Seeing this dark form of fire felt strange to everyone.\nShh!\nChun Yeowun lowered his hand, revealing his face, but Chun Yeowun’s face was also black.\nThe energy around him didn’t feel like his usual energy; it felt much darker. If they hadn’t known that it was Chun Yeowun, they would have thought that they were face-to-face with the Demon God, a divine being spoken in myths and legends.\n‘T-true Awakening?’\nMarquis Irene, who was caught by golden Gumiho’s tail, was sure that Chun Yeowun was going through a true Awakening.\n“How…how is this…”\nEven Marquis Cawl couldn’t help but be shocked. He always accompanied Dule Ludwig and was able to closely observe the transformation progress. There was no doubt that this was a True Awakening.\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun’s face of darkness, which shone like a flame, shook.\n-I’ve learned something great…\nCrackle!\n“\nEuk\n!”\n“T-the wind?!”\nThe moment the sound came, a huge gust of wind seemed to enter the room. Thanks to that, the demons who were bowing and even subordinates of Chun Yeowun were puzzled back.\n‘This…’\nEven Chun Yeowun was shocked. Just talking seemed to cause his power to explode, so he hurriedly raised his hand up to cover his face.\nReducing the effects of the Awakening, Chun Yeowun was able to return everything back to normal.\nPssss!\nThe darkness that wrapped around his entire body disappeared as it dispersed into the air.\nAnd the energy disappeared, Chun Yeowun’s hand trembled and he looked at it.\n‘The moment I used True Awakening, the Sky Demon Energy exploded.’\nIt wasn’t that the other energies increased, but rather that the Sky Demon Energy was pushed down and had exploded.\nAs a result, Chun Yeowun turned into an entity of darkness and chaos, creating a strange form.\n‘I can’t seem to use it for very long.’\nHe only used it for a while but an unknown fatigue rushed over his body.\nIt was like he had exhausted his entire body.\n“Chun Ma, it seemed like you were completely gone.”\nThe Golden Gumiho said in shock.\nHe realized that it was just as she said. When he was Awakened, he wasn’t there mentally.\nFor Murim warriors, that meant that they had reached new heights. In an instant, Chun Yeowun no longer seemed human.\n“Well, that could be it.”\nChun Yeowun didn’t deny it.\nHe, too, thought that the weird senses he felt before returning to his human form were odd.\nAt that moment, someone walked in front of Chun Yeowun. In shock, Marquis Irene yelled at the person,\n“Papa!”\nWalking in front of Chun Yeowun was Duke Bevman, and as he looked at Chun Yeowun with trembling eyes, he asked,\n“You, who are you? Are you Arisha’s reincarnation?”",

      "content": "Chapter 194: Grand Duke (1)\nAngel’s Notes about the Demonic Power Awakening:\nThere are 2 levels of the Demons’ Awakening:\nAnother type of Awakening:\n— I am true darkness. Let this darkness of mine be like chaos itself. I am the flame. Let this blazing flame lead you into darkness. My guidance will be your path.\nThose words were written on the stone tablet in the temple of Arisha.\nArisha’s temple was where only those with Duke title or higher could enter. There, Duke Bevman saw those words thousands or even more times.\nWhen he saw Chun Yeowun, who had a power that only beings higher than a Grand Duke could have, he suddenly thought of those words in the temple.\n‘Why did I suddenly think of it?’\nChun Yeowun had nothing to do with their clan. He was a human. A mere human. However, the moment he saw the darkness and the flame together, it popped up.\n‘Black flame.’\nThe power that symbolized Arisha. It wasn’t known why he thought of it.\n“Arisha? That is absurd.”\nChun Yeowun heard from Shakena that Arisha was a God-like existence to them. Therefore, he dismissed it, thinking it was his own power.\n“Who are you? I have never heard or seen a human with such power.”\n“Quite funny. You people think you are the center of this wide world.”\n“If you aren’t the incarnation of Arisha, why are you like thi….”\nChun Yeowun approached him and grabbed his head when he was still speaking.\nGrab!\n“\nKuak\n!”\n“Don’t push your luck. I am the great Sky Demon Order’s Chun Ma, the Demon God you all should fear.”\n“Demon…God?”\nDemon God.\nThe title which Chun Yeowun was given.\nAt that, Duke Bevman’s eyes trembled.\nJust as Chun Yeowun knew that Arisha was the God they worshiped, Duke Bevman, too, had come to Earth over the years and knew what Demon God meant.\n“… you are really the Demon God… No, are you?”\nSuddenly, Duke Bevman’s attitude turned polite. Chun Yeowun made a puzzled expression.\nThud!\nDuke Bevman suddenly knelt on one knee and placed his right hand on his chest.\n“Papa!”\nMarquis Irene shouted as she was startled by his father’s actions. The reaction was the same from the other demons and Marquis Cawl.\nThey all knew what that position meant.\n‘W-why?’\n‘I-isn’t that the bow to the king?!’\nSurprisingly, the bow he did was a sacred bow only to be done to their king, the Demon King, and of course, to the temple as well.\n“Duke Bevman greets the great one with respect.”\n“Papa!”\nMarquis Irene couldn’t stand it any longer, so she shouted.\nThis seemed wrong. He was bowing in front of someone other than the Demon King or the person he swore allegiance to, Grand Duke Kaliaf.\nShh!\nDuke Bevman reached out and gestured to her to shut up. His voice echoed in her mind as she couldn’t understand what her father was doing.\n[Stay still.]\nThis was telepathy to the demons to talk secretly without speaking out.\nShe asked, bewildered by his actions.\n[Papa. What are you doing? That man is the enemy. If Grand Duke Kaliaf knew that you did that before a human, he would never forgive you!]\nBut the response from Duke Bevman came back calmly.\n[Not a human.]\n[Huh?]\nShe frowned.\nHe might be a monster for them, but what was this about him not being a human?\n[What are you even saying…]\n[This one is the Demon God of Earth.]\n[What?]\n[Well, you haven’t been to this place for long, so you might not know.]\n[…what are you saying?]\n[It means someone like the great Arisha of our clan.]\n[A-arisha!]\n[Our clan uses Arisha… and\nthey\nuse\nTalisha\n, this person is the God who symbolizes the\nDemon\nof this place.]\n[No way…]\nHer expression changed as she looked at Chun Yeowun in awe.\n‘What is with her?’\nChun Yeowun raised his eyebrow at that.\nLooking at them looking at each other, Chun Yeowun was sure they were talking about something.\n‘Nano… can you eavesdrop on their talks?’\n[I will try searching for the frequencies.]\nNano searched for frequencies around. However, the telepathy that demons used didn’t need energy for it.\n[Cannot perform the action.]\nAt the unfortunate answer, Chun Yeowun looked at the father and daughter and spoke in irritation.\n“What are you two doing?”\nDuke Bevman seemed shocked at it. It was just a question, but it seemed like he guessed what was happening.\n‘H-He even managed to notice that we were using telepathy?’\nIt was funny.\nThis misunderstanding that started was constantly growing bigger and bigger. Duke Bevman bowed his head and spoke like a guilty person.\n“I apologize. In the presence of the great being, I used telepathy to stop my daughter. Forgive me for the disrespect I caused so recklessly.”\n“Hm.”\nChun Yeowun touched his chin, wondering if something had gone wrong somewhere. Something felt weird about this demon.\nJust by looking at the attitude, he could tell that this was different from how the regular demons would swear allegiance.\n‘A little better than that?’\nEither way, it was certain that this demon was afraid of him. If so, he could bring out a considerable amount of information.\nAnd as demons cannot be turned into Ghosts, there was no other way but to make them speak.\n“From now on, answer my questions.”\n“Please do ask.”\n“Lie, and it will end with your death.”\n“How can I lie to a great being?”\n‘Uh…’\nSomehow, even Chun Yeowun felt like this demon was misunderstanding something but didn’t see the need to clarify it.\n“Why are you all aiming for this sword and the other weapons?”\nHe actually knew the reason because Shakena told him, but this question was asked to check if there was another hidden reason.\n“Arisha’s Armor is a sacred item of the clan. What it symbolizes is the king.”\n“King?”\n“Only the king can have the armor and use it.”\n“I heard that your king isn’t present or that some problem occurred. So, you did this to take the vacant place?”\n“Ah…”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s direct question, Duke Bevman, who was silent for a bit, spoke.\n“The king holds a crucial position in the clan. However, our King hadn’t been seen for a very long time, and the people closest to him are ignoring the affairs of our clan.”\n“Doorknob something?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, Duke Bevman’s eyes lit up. He didn’t think that their clan’s slang would be heard from a being of another planet.\n“…they can be called as such.”\n“So, this was to drive them out?”\n“How can we ever go and fight enemies without a leader who rules over the clan?”\n“Enemy? Your clan has enemies?”\nAt that question, the duke smiled.\n“Our planet is ten times the size of this planet. It is natural for other beings to exist besides our clan.”\nChun Yeowun thought.\nShakena, who came here under the orders of one of the four aides, who were the closest to the King, had her own opinion. Now, these answers showed the cause for the actions.\n“The one you serve is the one called Grand Duke Kaliaf?”\n“Right.”\n“Then he wants to challenge the throne?”\n“Yes. Grand Duke Kaliaf wants to become the king and revive our clan again.”\nDuke Bevman answered with a voice that showed his loyalty. He aimed to make the lord above him the king.\n“Arisha’s Armor has a value that symbolizes one as the king.”\n“It isn’t just that.”\nDuke Bevman waved his hand and continued.\n“Then?”\n“It has been said that those who wear the armor can have the power of Arisha.”\n“Power of Arisha?”\n“Arisha’s Armor is indeed a powerful weapon. If it falls into one of the close aides of the kind, their reign will grow stronger too.”\nPak!\n“Please consider our clan and grant the Arisha’a armor to Grand Duke Kaliaf, the great being.”\nThey needed it.\nBut Chun Yeowun had a question. According to Shakena, it was said that these close aides of the king were preventing the others from finding the armor to maintain their power.\n‘But it doesn’t seem like that.’\nIf Duke Bevman’s words were heard clearly, even the king’s aides were also searching for the armor.\nAs long as they find it, they can replace the Demon King.\nInstead, it was possible to rule the clan more stably.\n‘Weren't they the ones who hid it?’\nInitially, Chun Yeowun thought that the Demon King’s closest aides hid Arisha's Armor. However, hearing both stories, that didn’t seem to be the case.\n“You.”\n“Yes?”\n“Do you know when and how this sword and Arisha’s Armor got into this place?”\nFrom the memories he saw, these items just fell onto Earth a long time back. So he thought these long-living demons would know.\nBut,\n“I don’t know.”\n“You don’t know? Does it make sense that you don’t know about your own things?”\n“Why would I dare and lie to you?”\nDuke Bevman looked up with bright eyes. He displayed unshaken eyes. Seeing that, Chun Yeowun didn’t feel like he was being deceived.\n“Even Grand Duke Kaliaf doesn’t know?”\nHis eyes trembled at the question leaving a silent answer.\n“He seems to know.”\n“… I won't deny that.”\nDuke Bevman didn’t hide it. To him, the Grand Duke might have known.\nHe bowed again and asked Chun Yeowun, who had an expressionless face.\n“Great being. Could you please give us Arisha's Armor?”\n“If I won’t?”\n‘!?’\nDuke Bevman didn’t hide his shock at the outright refusal.\nThe demons needed it. So Duke Bevman spoke very cautiously.\n“… Grand Duke Kaliaf will never give up on it. Not just him, but even the king's aides will not stop.”\nIn other words, if the Arisha's Armor isn’t given, the demons will continue to come to Earth. This wasn’t a threat but the truth.\nThis was because they knew the armor was the only way the internal rift could be ended.\nChun Yeowun smiled.\n“If possible, tell them to come and try.”\n‘!!!’\nDuke Bevman was perplexed at the arrogant response and didn’t know what to do.\nIf Grand Duke Kaliaf heard that, he would be so furious that he’d personally come down here.\n“…would the others be fine?”\nDuke Bevman asked, looking around. It was directed at the others around Chun Yeowun. He didn’t intend to provoke, but there was no other way.\n“Fine…huh!”\nChun Yeowun didn’t seem much bothered.\nDuke Bevman began to turn anxious. Chun Yeowun, who stared, moved closer and said,\n“Right. You do have a point.”\nDuke Bevman, afraid that Chun Yeowun would kill him in anger, sighed in relief.\nDuke Bevman thought he was lucky to escape it.\n“You made a difficult decision. I will inform the Grand Duke to take measures so that no one will come to Earth….”\nGrab!\n“\nKuak\n!”\nChun Yeowun suddenly grabbed his hair.\nAt the uncalled-for act, Duke Bevman spoke.\n“W-why are you acting like this?”\n“You seem to misunderstand something.”\n“Uh?”\n“Do you think I will sit here silently waiting for them?”\nTo that, Duke Bevman asked, trembling.\n“W-what do you mean by that?”\nLooking at him, Chun Yeowun spoke.\n“I will go there myself.”\n‘!?’\nFor a moment, Duke Bevman went speechless.\nHe never expected to hear words, which meant he would move to their planet, and the other demons reacted the same way.\n‘Come to our planet?’\n‘No way…does he mean he’ll attack us?’\nInvasion?\nIt was an idea that had never crossed their mind before.\nAs Duke Bevman was still bewildered, Chun Yeowun said,\n“Open the Gate this instant.”",

      "content": "Chapter 195: Grand Duke (2)\nWhen asked to open the Gate, Duke Bevman showed a bitter expression. Duke Bevman was wary of the danger to his life, as Chun Yeowun was a god-like being on Earth.\n‘What do I do?’\nThere was no one here to stop Chun Yeowun.\nWhich meant there were two options: either refusing the request and dying, or opening the gate and taking Chun Yeowun there.\n‘If I bring him, rebellion will happen.’\nChun Yeowun’s purpose was obvious, but Duke Bevman was sure that the Grand Duke would not bow his head to this monster.\nAlthough Grand Duke Kaliaf was known to be the most powerful amongst the Grand Dukes, he was at war with the Demon King’s aides at the moment.\n‘I believe him, but…’\nIn the best-case scenario, only the strongest and most relevant people would be involved, but otherwise, all demons would be wiped out.\nThen, someone’s voice was heard.\n[Papa.]\nIt was from Marquis Irene. Duke Bevman looked at Chun Yeowun with a surprised look, scared that Chun Yeowun might find out about the telepathic communication.\n[Papa!]\n[Don’t do anything dangerous. The Demon God might hear you.]\n[… What are you saying? How can this Demon God do something that neither the Grand Duke nor the Demon King could do?]\n[Stop talking!]\nDuke Bevman was scared and warned Marquis Irene, but ignoring his words, she continued to talk.\n[He might notice it, but he won’t know what we’re saying.]\n[Hmm.]\n[Let’s test it. Great being, can you hear this? Please look at me if you can hear this.]\nChun Yeowun didn’t move, still holding onto Duke Bevman’s hair.\n“Did you hear me when I told you to open the Gate?”\n‘Ah!’\nDuke Bevman then realized that Chun Yeowun couldn’t hear them and was embarrassed for thinking too highly of him before. Then, Marquis Irene continued to send more telepathic messages.\n[See that? Papa, this is good.]\nHe couldn’t hide his wonder as she continued.\n[Well, this man has Arisha's weapon in his hands. We don’t know how many he has, but we need to collect all of them from him.]\nShe was right. In order for Grand Duke Kaliaf to win the war against the Demon King’s closest aides, utilizing Arisha’s armor was necessary.\nHowever, the risk was too great.\n[This would be like carrying an uncontrollable, ticking bomb.]\n[We have to make it believable.]\n[What do you mean?]\n[We only need to change the gate’s coordinates.]\nAt those words, Duke Bevman’s eyes twinkled. Come to think of it, he could just teleport Chun Yeowun to the wrong coordinates.\nThe Gate entrance’s destination was limited to only one location, but when going back, they could return to any desired coordinates.\n[That is a nice idea. But—]\n[Papa. He might become suspicious, so act a little reluctant.]\nRealizing that his daughter’s plan could work, he said,\n“Are you sure?”\n“Don’t make me say it twice.”\nDuke Bevman acted like he didn’t have a choice.\n“… I understand. I’ll open the Gate.”\nWhisper!\nThe demons, who didn’t know about his plan, were shocked by his actions.\n‘Is he really fine with it?’\n‘The Grand Duke will be angry.’\nEven if they had surrendered here, they would have never taken another being back to their own planet.\n“Lord, are you really going?”\nHu Bong asked Chun Yeowun, hearing Duke Bevman’s decision.\n“Yes.”\nOnce Chun Yeowun made a decision, he never went back on it. Knowing this, Hu Bong didn’t ask any more questions.\nBut,\n“Then, take us along.”\n“No. I’m going alone.”\n“Huh? Alone?”\nIt was not just Hu Bong, but even Baekgi and Mun Ran-yeong opposed it.\nNo matter how strong Chun Yeowun was, there was no way his subordinates would allow him to enter the enemy base alone.\nThe Golden Gumiho agreed with them.\n“Chun Ma! You mean you know where you’re going but still want to go alone? Keep me with you.”\n“No, you’ll look after this place.”\n“Lord!”\n“Chun Ma!”\nEveryone objected to it, but Chun Yeowun didn’t change his mind for two reasons.\nBecause he was going to another planet, it was possible that if everyone went with him, something unexpected could happen and no one would survive.\nAnd the second reason was that there would only be more chaos if they came.\n“The war with MS Group is still ongoing.”\nAlthough the current Sky Demon Order was stronger compared to the past, the MS Group had the ability to mass-produce humanoids who were strengthened through technology.\nTaking these reasons into consideration, it was safe to say that the Golden Gumiho and his subordinates need to stay here.\n“Lord!”\nHu Bong fell flat on the floor.\n“If that’s the reason, since I’m weak compared to my wife and Baekgi, taking me shouldn’t really affect the loss of power here.”\nHearing Hu Bong’s words, Chun Yeowun rubbed his forehead.\nChun Yeowun was stubborn, but Hu Bong was even more stubborn. Strong and loyal, he always wanted to be by Chun Yeowun’s side.\n“Lord Chun Ma, please let him go with you. As the Chun Ma of the Sky Demon Order, you cannot leave alone.”\nMun Ran-yeong, too, pleaded with him. Although she felt uneasy about sending her husband, she couldn’t let Chun Yeowun leave alone.\nBaekgi added.\n“Hu Bong is right. That guy staying or not staying won’t have any effect, so just take him along like a tag, Lord.”\n‘Staying or not staying won’t have any effect?’\nHu Bong frowned while looking at Baekgi; it didn’t seem like Baekgi spoke with the intention to help him.\nHearing them plead, Chun Yeowun still shook his head and said,\n“No.”\n“Lord, why?”\n“No more words.”\nWith that, he removed his grip on Duke Bevman’s head and urged him,\n“Open the Gate.”\n“Lord!”\nChun Yeowun didn’t turn around. He was grateful for Hu Bong’s loyalty, but that was why he couldn’t take him along.\n‘What will happen if we’re both stuck there? What about the Great Elder?’\nWhenever Chun Yeowun thought of Mun Ku, his wife, he was filled with sorrow. He didn’t want anyone else to go through what he did.\n“Don’t worry. I’ll be back soon.”\nThere was shuffling around the emergency stairs of the Yongchun Group site.\nDuke Bevman and Marquis Irene were heading to the roof to open the Gate. As they climbed, Duke Bevman asked his daughter with telepathy:\n[Irene, where will we teleport him to? I suppose you’re not planning to teleport him to where the Grand Duke is.]\nIt was impossible to send Chun Yeowun, who had Arisha’s armor, to just anywhere without care. Irene answered with a smile.\n[Papa,\nthat\nplace.]\n[That?]\n[Bamut’s underground water gate.]\n[Bamut? No, that’s where the worst prisoners are locked.]\nBamut’s underground water cell was a prison for the worst criminals in their clan. It was an atrocious prison where those who entered never left.\nHowever, this underground cell was also located in the middle of Grand Duke Kaliaf’s realm.\n[That’s why we’ll send him there.]\n[What?]\n[We can lock him there and make him fight them.]\n[Ah.]\nDuke Bevman seemed to like her plan. Irene was the smart, analytical one from the beginning, which was why she stayed as his right-hand woman.\n[I heard that some prisoners in Bamut are at the Duke level. We can offer pardons to those prisoners in exchange for killing him, and they’ll all rush to kill him right away.]\n[I thoroughly understand the plan now.]\n[Right, even if he is a human on par with a Grand Duke, he will end up exhausting all of his strength after dealing with those prisoners.]\n[Once he’s exhausted, the Grand Duke can then lead his troops into the prison and deal with him.]\nDuke Bevman wanted to applaud the plan, but he couldn’t risk Chun Yeowun noticing, albeit walking in front of Chun Yeowun.\nThud!\nThe iron gates opened and the large rooftop with a helipad came into view, and only those three were able to see the view.\nThe other demons were held as hostages and the Golden Gumiho was keeping watch to make sure that nobody tried any funny business.\nTak!\nMarquis Irene put down a case-like device to open the Gate on the floor. The demons often seemed like barbaric, war-like beings, but they actually had advanced technology that could open Gates to other planets.\nTaktak!\nChun Yeowun looked at her fidgeting with the device.\n“I am warning you. Don’t even try to do something strange.”\nAt his warning, she responded,\n“How can I try anything of the sort in the presence of a great being? We’ll be moving together.”\nDespite saying that, she was changing the coordinates to where Chun Yeowun would be teleported. In order to avoid any suspicions, Marquis Irene kept showing the Gate’s display..\n‘He doesn’t know our clan’s language.’\nDuke Bevman was grateful for their luck; if Chun Yeowun knew their language, he would have been beyond angry with them.\nOnce the destination was set, she said,\n“Please don’t move from your standing position. Any movements or changes can interfere.”\nAlthough she said those words out loud, internally, she was thinking something entirely different.\n‘That way, you will fall right into the Bamut’s cell! Huhuhu!’\nLaughing inside, she pressed one of the buttons as a tremendous energy was released from the device.\nWoong!\nThe Gate opened into the air as the space began to warp, which looked like there was a hole in the sky.\n“Go.”\nWith those words, she moved her hands. Thinking she succeeded, her lips turned into a smile.\nTsssss!\nParticles began to scatter around as everything was sucked into the Gate.\n‘You stupid idiot. No matter how strong you are, there’s no way you can understand our extremely advanced technology. This is our victory!”\nTsss!\nMoments later, the particles over her body scattered and her consciousness was cut off.\nOn a brown planet hundreds of millions of light years away from Earth:\nThree planets several times the size of Earth appeared to be satellites around this planet.\nPerhaps, these three planets were the moons of this main planet.\nUnlike Earth, where clouds were visible, a sharp crimson hue filled the sky.\nThe huge planet had an unmistakable red sky.\nIn one city, there was a large castle with a pointed shape in its center.\nThis castle belonged to Grand Duke Kaliaf, who ruled the city. In the sky just above the castle, which was guarded by hundreds of demons, the space was twisted as a huge Gate opened.\nWoong!\n“Gate!”\n“A Gate is opening!”\nThe demons guarding the place shouted, and not long after, demons inside the castle walked out to the courtyard wearing very colorful clothes.\nIn front of them was a man in a red cloak and golden crown: Grand Duke Kaliaf, who wore himself with dignity.\n“Is the Gate from outsiders?”\nIn response to the question, a man with brown hair and green armor who was following Grand Duke Kaliaf answered,\n“It is ours.”\nThe man was Duke Igor, Grand Duke Kaliaf’s left arm.\n“So quick.”\nIt hadn’t been long since they were sent out, but they were already coming back so soon?\nThen, particles started to gather in the castle yard and took the shapes of two people.\nTssss!\nAs the particles finalized the shapes, one of the people shouted,\n“Duke Bevman greets the Grand Duke.”\nIt was none other than Duke Bevman.\nBevman breathed a sigh of relief seeing his lord and hurriedly said,\n“Lord! Please, we need to hurry! You need to lead your troops to the Bamut Underground Cell right now!”\n“To Bamut?”\n“I will explain as we go. A dangerous being with Arisha’s armor is trapped there. Along with Marquis Irene…uh?”\nDuke Bevman, who was speaking, noticed that something was off. All the demons, instead of looking at him, were looking to his side.\n‘Irene…?!!!’\nDuke Bevman’s eyes widened as he looked at his side.\n“W-what?”\nWhere Marquis Irene was supposed to be stood Chun Yeowun.\nHe spoke in a cold voice to the shocked man,\n“I definitely told you to not mess around.”\nAt the same time, in a cavity surrounded by darkness:\nA white-haired woman was unable to hide her shock at the gloomy situation.\n“T-this…”\nShe was Marquis Irene, and she looked around vigilantly, unable to understand what had happened.\n‘Shit!’\nNumerous red eyes were staring at her throughout the dark place, as if looking at their prey.\n‘No!’\nShe knew right away where she was.\n“W-why am I in here?”\nThis dark environment was none other than the Bamut underground cell, the worst prison filled with the most horrible kinds of criminals, and she was here instead of Chun Yeowun.\nBefore she could recover her senses, the voices started sounding.\n“A woman!”\n“I want to eat her!”\n“A toy to play with!”\nNo matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t think more as her shock turned into fear.",

      "content": "Chapter 196: Grand Duke (3)\nRisha - a title for the best warrior of the Demon clan.\nWhy was Chun Yeowun there instead of Marquis Irene?\n“W-where is my daughter?”\nDuke Bevman asked with a trembling voice. Looking at him, Chun Yeowun answered coldly.\n“She must be in the place where you were trying to send me.”\n“B-Bamut!”\nThe prison where their clan's most vicious members were imprisoned; monsters ravenous for their desires. His daughter was in that abhorrible place…?\nBeing engulfed by the thought that this man harmed his son and daughter, Duke Bevman tried to attack in rage.\n“You bastard!”\nPhat!\nHis body, which was about to blow out, was suddenly stopped not by his will but by someone else’s. An unfathomable demonic power was holding him back.\n‘T-this?’\nDuke Bevman turned his head and looked at the one moving towards him.\n“Grand Duke!”\n“What happened? The person there is… human.”\nAt the words of Grand Duke, the yard where the demons had gathered was suddenly filled with whispers. There had never been any chance of humans invading their planet, so this was a tremendous deal.\nThe lost-tempered Duke Bevman grasped what kind of situation this was and tried to speak.\n“Sire! Grand Duke! This human holds Arisha's Armor!”\n“Arisha’s Armor?”\nThere was no need to explain what happened anymore. This one piece of information was more than needed.\nAs soon as the words were spoken, Duke Igor raised his hand next to Grand Duke Kaliaf.\nChachacha!\nAll the demons who witnessed it pulled out their weapons.\nWheing!\nClack!\nFurthermore, the defense systems installed on the top of the castle walls were activated, and numerous muzzle-shaped devices were aimed at Chun Yeowun. And if one was able to get so many people on alert with a single signal from hand, then it meant that they were well trained.\nDuke Igor stepped forward and said, “Human. Is it true that you have Arisha’s Armor?”\nChun Yeowun crossed his arms and answered.\n“So?”\nChun Yeowun’s relaxed response didn’t sit well with Duke Igor. In a way, this human was in the middle of the enemy camp, and just like the other insignificant human beings, he should be crawling in fear in front of the most high-ranking demons, but he displayed none of it.\n“Cheeky bastard.”\nAs Duke Igor raised his hand while extending just his index and middle finger, Chun Yeowun could then feel the vibration in the place he stood.\nDrrrr!\nAt the same time, an energy barrier had formed around him and enclosed him like a tube, making it difficult to move even a few steps.\nPhat!\nWithout missing the chance, Duke Bevman moved away from Chun Yeowun. Duke Igor was bewildered seeing him all vigilant about a human.\n“Duke Bevman. What are you doing?”\nTo which the answer came in a serious tone.\n“That person is like Arisha of the Earth. Do not look down on him.”\n“Arisha of the Earth?”\nDuke Igor thought those words were absurd. As if it wasn’t enough to act scared of a human, he compared him to Arisha.\n“Hahaha. Duke Bevman, you are talking nonsense. Aren’t you just scared of that human?”\nDuke Bevman bit his lip at the ridicule. Despite being the left and right arm of the Grand Duke, they were still rivals. That statement was definitely an attack to lower his position.\n“Well, you did well. Your decision isn’t wrong. Humans can’t stand the environment here. Hahaha.”\nThe gravity of this planet was ten times that of Earth. In addition, the oxygen was much lower than on Earth which made it tough for humans to survive.\n“Duke Igor.”\n“Yes, Your Highness?”\n“Enough of this, and retrieve Arisha's Armor from that human.”\n“Yes, Your Highness.”\nThe smiling Duke Igor approached Chun Yeowun. Chun Yeowun, who was caught behind the barrier, merely remained there as if he was waiting to see what else they would do.\nDuke Igor spoke to him.\n“Human. Even breathing must be turning hard for you. From the moment you entered this place, you have been pushing yourself to the end.”\nWhen Duke Igor arrived in front of Chun Yeowun, the Duke suggested while motioning as if he was ready to flick his finger.\n“This Duke will show mercy to you. If you want to live, give me Arisha's Armor. Then I will spare your life. But how long can you even last….”\n“Phew.”\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun took a deep breath. Duke Igor thought it was because of the less oxygen.\n“It will get harder and harder for you to breathe. Hurry up—”\n“I am getting used to it.”\n“What?”\nChun Yeowun breathed naturally, which made Duke Igor frown.\nBy now, it was normal for a human’s face to be distorted and in pain because of a lack of oxygen. However, Chun Yeowun seemed fine.\n[The lung capacity has been adjusted to the oxygen concentration of this environment.]\nOf course, this was because he had Nano. Nano made it easier for the body to receive oxygen from his new place. Thanks to that, he adjusted well.\nThat’s not all.\nShh!\nDuke Igor was even more puzzled as Chun Yeowun easily took a step ahead.\n‘What is this? How is he moving?’\nThe place is ten times the size of the Earth, and the extreme gravity should have made the human feel a lot of new weight on him. However, what was this light step?\nWhat he had witnessed made him puzzled, and Chun Yeowun put his hand on the energy barrier around him.\n“Don’t act stupid. That is a field of 100,000 amperes. If you don’t want to lose your hand….”\nChhhik!\nBefore finishing his sentence, Chun Yeowun’s hand had already touched the barrier.\nAt that moment, the barrier waved.\nPang!\nWith the sound, the barrier began to split open like a glass. It was then that Duke Igor finally realized….\n‘This one is dangerous.’\nHe moved back and shouted.\n“Detroit!”\n— Wheing!\nA red light flashed from the muzzle on the castle wall.\nWhen enough energy was condensed….\n“Shoot!”\nAfter the command, the muzzles shot out numerous beams, hitting the barrier that Chun Yeowun was tearing.\nKwakwakwang!\nThe rays were so intense that nothing else could be seen. At a distance, Duke Igor mumbled a question.\n“Is he dead?”\nIt was then that he heard a voice.\n“Stop.”\nIt was Grand Duke Kaliaf’s command. At his word, Duke Igor bowed.\nSlash!\n“Huh?”\nAt a sudden moment, a sharp sense passed through their stomach. The sense passed from him to the Grand Duke and the other demons.\n“Your Highness!”\n“It’s dangerous!”\nThe demons tried to act as shields and block it.\n“Stand back.”\nTak!\nWith those words, Grand Duke Kaliaf flicked his finger lightly. Then the space in front shook, and the sharp sense got sucked into it.\nShhhh!\nThe dust from the beams was also removed, and Chun Yeowun was seen.\n“He withstood Detroit?”\n“I-is he really human?”\nThe demons couldn’t help but be shocked at the sight. Chun Yeowun stepped ahead and said, “Quite good.”\nIt was the first time someone blocked the Invisible Sword imbued with Sky Demon Energy this way.\nIf the Sky Demon Energy is placed on the Invisible Sword, the power is doubled. Regular demons would have tried to block it with their abilities, but Grand Duke Kaliaf blocked it with his unique ability.\n“… it’s been a long time since I’ve seen a good swordsman like you.”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf walked out looking interested.\n“Your Highness!”\nThe Demon clan under his command were shocked as they watched their leader show an interest in an existence that had nothing to do with their clan or his men. Duke Igor, who avoided the attack, shouted.\n“Your Highness! You don’t have to do this. I—”\n“He isn’t someone you can take on.”\n“Huh?”\nGrand Duke highly valued the ability of Chun Yeowun. At his words, Duke Igor just clenched his teeth and glared at Chun Yeowun because he couldn’t go against his Lord’s command.\nHe then heard Chun Yeowun’s words.\n“I spared your life.”\nCrack!\n‘That bastard!’\nChun Yeowun's provocation worked. Even if he didn’t, he thought this insulted him in front of the other demons.\n“You trivial human!”\nPhat!\nDuke Igor flew to Chun Yeowun. The moment he moved, horns protruded from his forehead, and his appearance changed.\nAs soon as he attacks, he transforms his body into the awakened form. Apart from his anger, he was a veteran in battle. He decided to do his best and give his all, knowing that Chun Yeowun was extraordinary.\nPang!\nAt the moment of his awakening, a tremendous amount of demonic power created a wind force in all directions.\nThis is the momentum to kill Chun Yeowun.\n“I’ll kill you!”\n“You will die too.”\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun drew a vertical slash with a sword. A black line appeared in the air and then passed to the rushing Duke Igor.\nSlash!\n“Kuak!”\nDuke Igor’s body stopped as his painful scream erupted.\n“W-what is… this….”\n“You should have listened to your master.”\nChun Yeowun smiled, looking at him.\n“You… You…”\nChak!\nBefore he could let out his anger, Duke Igor’s body was split in half. Even the nucleus inside his body was shattered. A black smoke broke out from his body, and ashes began to scatter.\nPsss!\nThere was a moment of silence. All the demons who saw the scene were shocked at it.\n‘D-Duke Igor instantly…?’\n‘Is that man really a human?’\nDuke Igor, who was thought to be the second-in-command to Grand Duke Kaliaf, was cut to two instantly.\nThere should be an overwhelming difference in their skills to achieve this result.\n‘I warned him.’\nDuke Bevman clicked his tongue and thought it was fortunate that Grand Duke Kaliaf had stopped him when he tried to attack Chun Yeowun.\nWith this, Chun Yeowun proved his strength to the demons. Being shocked, Grand Duke Kaliaf spoke.\n“It is surprising… to cut through the space with a sword.”\nIn that brief moment, he noticed that the single slash from Chun Yeowun cut through space. He was the only one from the demons to see this. His lips twitched. He was feeling elated.\n“It has been two thousand years since I have felt this intense emotion.”\nA strong force wanting to win.\nHe didn’t hide his joy in meeting a strong man after a long time.\nGrand Duke Kaliaf smiled and stepped forward.\n“I like this.”\nShh!\nThe black iron guard of one of Duke Kaliaf’s legs disassembled and turned into a spear. It was a strange spear with seven blades.\nChun Yeowun’s eyes lit up. The spear that was called was one of Arisha's Armor weapons…\n‘As expected.’\nChun Yeowun had guessed that two of his weapons weren’t on Earth, which seemed accurate.\nGrand Duke Kaliaf made a proposal to Chun Yeowun.\n“Human. How about making a bet?”\n“Bet?”\n“Yes. I like you.”\n“So?”\n“I want you.”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf said with a greedy face and licked his lips.\nAt the disgusting sight, Chun Yeowun frowned.\nIgnoring Chun Yeowun’s reaction, Grand Duke Kaliaf continued.\n“Compete with me. If you lose, hand over Arisha's Armor and become my subordinate.”\nAt those words, the demons panicked. To say that he wanted Chun Yeowun as a subordinate was shocking.\n“It isn’t a bad proposal to you. Even if you lose, you will have the honor of becoming my right arm in the future as the Demon King.”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf said as if his victory was decided. Chun Yeowun then responded with a smile.\n“And if you lose?”\n“It will not happen.”\nThe Grand Duke’s confidence now seemed like arrogance.\n“If that happens, I’ll give you everything you want. Do you have something you want?”\nAt that, Chun Yeowun stepped ahead and said, “You might not be able to handle it.”\n“Huhuhu~ there is nothing that this Grand Duke cannot handle. Say it.”\n“I am thinking of assuming the\nposition\nof the Demon King that you people like so much would be good.”\n“What?”\nThe leisure expression on Grand Duke Kaliaf had hardened in an instant.\nDOTDG Staff Note:\nThe term ‘nucleus/nuclei’ will now be consistently used for\ndemons\nand ‘core/s’ for\nmonsters\n. These terms were interchangeably used, but our dear translator said they significantly differ since the demons’ nuclei don’t have energy as the monsters’ cores do.\nAngel’s Corner\nDid you notice something? Hehe. I’ll continue adding little facts at the beginning of every chapter if you guys want me to. ??",

      "content": "Chapter 197: Grand Duke (4)\nBamut — is known to be the worst prison in the Demon Realm. This was a place where no one could regenerate after getting injured.\nIn the Yongchun Group’s vice chairman’s office:\nThe wall on every side was encased with ice, traces of Chun Yeowun’s freezing the entire building that was about to collapse.\nHu Bong looked at the walls and sighed,\n“Ugh.”\n“Stop it. I’ll hit you off.”\nBaekgi, who was sitting on the sofa, yelled at the sighs. Frustrated, Hu Bong yelled back,\n“Aren't you worried?”\n“How can I not be? He's somewhere we’ve never even heard of.”\nThere was no way he couldn’t worry for his Lord. Hu bong mumbled in response,\n“The Lord was probably worried for us, but I just want him to trust us a little more.”\nHe knew how strong the enemies were and that a crisis would follow the invasion.\nHowever, the feeling of not being able to fulfill his duty as a subordinate kept tormenting him.\n“Huh. I guess all the Chun Ma’s are like this.”\nThe Golden Gumiho in human form spoke out suddenly.\nShe was used to this behavior, as the first Chun Ma was also like this in the past.\n‘When I see this happening, the scent around him gets stronger.’\nShe wanted to see the past Chun Ma more. Baekgi, who was still seated, listened to Hu Bong and said,\n“If you’re just going to keep sighing, you should go and do some work instead.”\n“Work?”\n“Yes.”\n“Lord didn’t say anything—”\n“If he doesn’t give us any orders, are you just going to sit still?”\n“I-I’m not sitting still.”\n“Either way, the Lord was looking for information about MS Group and we need to look into them.”\n“You two.”\nMun Ran-yeong interrupted their conversation. With pitiful eyes, she asked,\n“How do you even plan to help when neither of you knows how to use a smartphone, let alone a computer?”\n“W-wife.”\n“G-great Elder.”\n“If you want to be helpful, learn more about the time period we’re in. Don’t do something dumb and end up hurting Chun Ma.”\nHearing her words, the two pulled out their smartphones.\nAlthough both the smartphones and classes were paid for and brought by Bi Mak-heon, neither Hu Bong nor Baekgi were in the mood to look into them.\n“Whatever. Ugh, men.\nTsk tsk\n.”\nMun Ran-yeong clicked her tongue after talking to them. Seeing her, the Golden Gumiho gave her a thumbs up to show her approval.\nThen:\n“Sire.”\nShakena, who was keeping watch over the demons, approached Marquis Cawl, who was tied with a rope imbued with Yokai energy.\n“How dare you, a traitor of the clan, talk to me?”\nMarquis Cawl turned his head in displeasure. It seemed like he felt that Shakena had turned sides and was the cause of everything happening. Explaining herself, Shakera said,\n“I didn’t betray anyone. I will always obey the orders of the King. But… those weren't the King’s orders.”\n“Duke Ludwig and the others represent the King.”\n“Then I am just as right in my position.”\n“You bitch!”\nGrab!\nMarquis Cawl tried to get up, but the rope around him began to tighten.\n“\nKuak\n!”\n“Idiot.”\nSeeing him in pain, the Golden Gumiho laughed. Shakena used his chin to lift his head.\n“W-what are you doing?”\nAs she lifted his face, he was full of shock and surprise as Shakena kept looking him in the eyes and said,\n“I was skeptical because the demonic power seemed weak, but I was right.”\nThe Golden Gumiho and Mun Ran-yeong, who didn’t understand, went closer to her.\n“What do you mean?”\nShakena then pointed to Marquis Cawl’s eyes.\n“I was being watched through the eyes of the Marquis.”\n“Through the eyes?”\n“I remember hearing about it: one of the Demon King’s closest aides, Duke Edhuy, could look through others’ eyes and see their world.”\n“Through others' eyes?”\n“Through other people’s eyes? Do you mean that he can monitor others by watching with their eyes?”\nShakena nodded in response. Marquis Cawl, whose face displayed that he had been caught, spoke,\n“You’re too late. They must already know the situation here.\nKuakuk\n!”\n“Such an annoying laugh.”\nThe Golden Gumiho didn’t like his laugh. Enjoying the reaction, Marquis Cawl spoke,\n“Your leader, that human Chun Mu-seong, will never come back alive to this place—”\nPuk!\n“\nKuak\n!”\nBefore he could finish speaking, two of the Gumiho’s fingers dug into Marquis Cawl’s eyes.\nShe kept pushing her fingers in as if digging into a holes until his eyes popped out.\n“\nAhhhhh\n! My eyes! My eyes!”\nEven a demon felt pain when its eyes were pierced. However, the screams didn’t last for too long.\nThe Golden Gumiho grabbed the eyeballs in her palm and crushed them. Worried, Shakera said,\n“He’s probably fine, but Master might be in danger.”\n“Chun Ma, in danger? As if! He’s such a monster.”\n“He would be fine if they were in the dark about what was happening, but what if they had been observing Master’s power and responded accordingly?”\nThis was what Shakena was most concerned about.\nWhat kind of power could they prepare if the Grand Dukes decided to strike first to take down the one human who was a threat?\nMeanwhile, in Grand Duke Kaliaf’s castle:\nThe demon's reactions were full of confusion and absurdity.\n‘What a cheeky bastard!’\n‘How can a human be put in the Demon King’s position!’\nNo one expected Chun Yeowun’s mouth to even mention the position of Demon King. They found it an insult for a mere human being to talk about the Demon King position so lightly.\nHowever, none of the demons were able to express their anger because they had witnessed Chun Yeowun’s power with their own eyes.\n“The position of Demon King?”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf, whose expression hardened for a moment, asked.\nChun Yeowun answered without hesitation,\n“I think that would be asking enough for the bet.”\nHearing his arrogant words, Grand Duke’s body trembled in anger.\nAll the demons looked at him with tense eyes; they too must have been angry but they feared the anger of Grand Duke Kaliaf, who was officially aiming for the position of Demon King. Then, something unexpected happened.\n“\nKuahahaha!\n”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf laughed out loud. It seemed more like a sneer than a laugh. After laughing, he said,\n“You really are an interesting one. You’re the first human being to utter such absurd words in front of me.”\n“Absurd…?”\n“Well, it’s rather bold of you and I like it.”\nChun Yeowun was puzzled that the Grand Duke considered his personality to be bold.\nChun Yeowun thought that if the Grand Duke was provoked to this extent, he would be unable to control his emotions and burst out into anger, but this demon seemed to have enjoyed nobility and maintained control over himself from birth.\n“Unfortunately, the position of the Demon King isn’t a position that I can give if I wanted to. If it was a position I could obtain that easily, I would have taken it by now.”\nHearing the Grand Duke’s words, Chun Yeowun was taken aback. When he heard about the Grand Duke from Shakena and Duke Bevman, he assumed that the demon just coveted position and its power.\nHowever, he realized that this man was more than that and seemed capable of ruling over others.\n“Fine. I am not the Demon King but I’ll make an offer that might interest you. If you win against me, then the Grand Duke, which is I, will become your servant according to the law of the clan.”\n“Your Highness!”\n“How can you!”\nThe demons, who had kept their mouths shut until then, were shocked. They had served Grand Duke Kaliaf as their lord for a very long time.\nThey all thought that he was destined to become the next Demon King, so they found it absurd for him to claim that he would give up the position if he lost to a mere human.\nIn response to their reactions, Grand Duke Kaliaf spoke in a seemingly unpleasant voice.\n“Does this mean you all don’t believe in the Grand Duke?”\n“N-No it isn’t—’\n“Then keep watching. I’ll show the power that someone willing to become a King should possess.”\nTak! Tak!\nGrand Duke Kaliaf removed the cloak from his shoulders; it looked like he was going for a clear fight and not just entertainment. Seeing this, Marquis Becken, one of the demons under his command, loudly raised the morale of the other demons.\n“Your Majesty is showing his greatness! Do you not believe in our Highness?”\nThe demons who were concerned moments earlier, suddenly changed their attitudes.\nThud!\nThey slammed their weapons into the floor and shouted,\n“No!!!”\n“This is the duty of us subordinates to boost the morale of His Highness. Victory to the Grand Duke!”\n“Victory to the Grand Duke!!! Woooh!!!”\nA shout which enclosed the entire army.\nThe demons, who were more barbaric than humans, naturally had strong fighting ability, but they had even more power when they were united.\nThey were the epitome of an army.\n“Grand Duke! Grand Duke! Grand Duke!!!”\nGrand Duke raised his hand as if he enjoyed the support. In an instant, the castle had become a battleground.\n“Now move.”\nIn response to the Grand Duke’s command, the demons retreated to the back as if forming a stage, knowing the aftermath from Grand Duke used his powers would destroy his surroundings.\nThe Grand Duke swung his spear and stepped forward with a warrior’s stance.\n“Let’s have an interesting match.”\nSeeing the Grand Duke’s enthusiasm and seriousness, Chun Yeowun smiled and said,\n“I like this.”\n“I can tell. I am also a warrior of the demon clan. You are a swordsman, right?”\nShh!\nThe Grand Duke grabbed his spear and aimed it. While all he did was grab it, the heavy energy that his body was radiating coalesced at the tip of the spear.\nHis expression was full of confidence from knowing how to properly handle the spear beyond just using it as a weapon.\nChun Yeowun said to him,\n“I will give you a chance.”\n“A chance?”\n“Don’t try to play around. Stop wasting your energy and start with your Awakening.”\n“What?”\nHearing Chun Yeowun’s words about starting with Advanced Awakening, the Grand Duke was flustered.\nThey hadn’t even fought yet but the human was already asking him to fight with his best. Although the Grand Duke knew that Chun Yeowun was a bold human, hearing his words displeased him a lot.\n“You seem to be confident in your skills, but if I do use my Awakening, you won’t stand a chance.”\nChun Yeowun responded with a smile,\n“It'll be the other way around.”\n“Other way?”\n“If you don’t use Advanced Awakening, this will end soon.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s arrogant-sounding words, anger rose not just in the Grand Duke but also in the rest of the demons who were watching the fight.\n“His Highness has done him such a favor!”\n“Arrogant human bastard!”\nAs the noise rose, the Grand Duke raised his head, causing the rest of the demons to become silent at once. With a stiff expression, the Grand Duke spoke again, holding his spear,\n“You are the first human to show such arrogance in front of me. I expect you have skills worthy of said arrogance.”\n“You’ll regret it.”\n“You talk too much.”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf stretched his spear forward. Although it seemed to be a simple stance, the moment the spear was pointed ahead, it radiated a powerful force and a whirlwind formed.\nKwakwakwang!\nIt was a spear attack that used demonic power. The spear caused the tornado to fly off, seemingly eager to swallow Chun Yeowun.\nIt was a terrifying attack, but Chun Yeowun just closed the gap and drew his sword, slicing the tornado from the top to the bottom.\nChak!\nAt that moment, the tornado split in half. The Grand Duke then swung his spear through the pierced tornado to block an approaching Invisible Sword.\nClang!\nFeeling the power behind the Invisible Sword, the Grand Duke smiled with pleasure.\n“Hahaha! This is what I’m talking about!”\n“It’s too early for you to enjoy this.”\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun appeared right in front of him, causing the Grand Duke to try to create a wind pressure by rotating his spear.\n“Your spear technique is rather dull compared to the strength you have.”\n“What?”\nWoong!\nChun Yeowun’s hand shone with five colors as he condensed the energy around him to form an Invisible Sword imbued with the energy of the Five Spirit Beasts.\nChachachang!\nSparks went flying as Arisha’s spear collided with Chun Yeowun’s sword of five attributes.\nHowever, after exchanging a few swings, the Grand Duke couldn’t help but be surprised by Chun Yeowun’s swordsmanship.\n‘What kind of sword is this?’\nCompared to his spear, Chun Yeowun’s sword felt dizzying.\nHow many times had the Grand Duke blocked its slashes? Chun Yeowun’s five attribute sword then skillfully pierced through a gap in the Grand Duke’s spear and pierced his heart.\nSwoosh!\n“Huha!”\nThe Grand Duke hurriedly moved back., but the sword that had already stabbed him once continued to aim for his chest.\nA pure white light suddenly shone from the Grand Duke’s eyes.\nWhoong!\nAt that moment, the space in front of him shook. Chun Yeowun’s sword, which was aiming for his chest, moved away in response.\n“Did you think you would win?”\nAs the Grand Duke prepared the strike to strike back, something unexpected occurred.\nPuck!\nSomething pierced through his shoulder.\n“\nKuak\n!”\nShocked that something hit him, the Grand Duke looked at his shoulder to find another sword with five attributes stuck in it.\n‘The one in his hand isn’t all he has?’\nGrand Duke, who hadn’t thought that hard, was overwhelmed by the two swords with the same natures that pierced both of his shoulders, causing him to fall to his knees.\nThud!\nThe demons who had been cheering for him suddenly became still out of shock.\n“H-His Highness is on his knees?”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf was considered to be the strongest of the three Grand Dukes. Even if he didn’t use his Advance Awakening, he was still someone who could consider the other demons as bugs. However, even\nhe\nknelt down?\n“\nHa\n!”\nChun Yeowun looked down arrogantly at the Grand Duke and said,\n“I definitely gave you a chance.”\n“Y… yes… right. I’ve made a mistake.”\nThe Grand Duke admitted his mistake, realizing that his opponent was someone whom he had to do his best against. The energies of the two swords pressing down on his shoulders weren’t just any energies.\n“Good. Do it right from now on.”\nPrrr!\nGrand Duke Kaliaf struggled to withstand the force from the two swords pressing down on his shoulders and raised his palms to cover his face.\nAt that moment, a sharp sense passed through his wrist.\nSlash!\n“\nEuk\n!”\nThe arm of the Grand Duke, which he was trying to lift, was cut off. The Grand Duke, who was about to awaken, looked at Chun Yeowun with a face of confusion.\nChun Yeowun sarcastically said,\n“I told you to transform before fighting. What are you, stupid?”",

      "content": "Chapter 198: Ambush (1)\n[Editor — Angel says no matter how OP Chun Yeowun is, he’ll still do his cutting of arms ceremony. Tradition is indeed essential to OPness.]\nTalisha’s clan — a long time nemesis of the Arisha’s clan.\n“You!”\n“How dare you act like that to the Grand Duke!”\nThe Marquis-level demons rose as they were enraged at the sight of their Grand Duke’s arm being cut off. Regardless of how strong Chun Yeowun might seem, they couldn’t let their Lord be humiliated like this.\n“You are interfering with the awakening!”\n“What kind of match is this?!”\nThey couldn’t comprehend the match. Grand Duke Kaliaf was defeated without even showing his full strength and was unfairly hindered. That was their thoughts.\n“You are all such funny ones.”\nChun Yeowun shook his head while looking at the demons. He was thorough in his battles. His decisions are always based on the most rational judgment to deal with the opponent, and everyone who fought would think that way.\nIt was funny that those who liked war couldn’t understand the concept and thought it was unfair.\nGrand Duke Kaliaf opened his mouth.\n“Stop!”\nAt his word, all the demons who shouted earlier went utterly silent.\n“Are you planning to disgrace me through such things?”\nTo come forward when the opponent hasn’t surrendered wasn’t accepted. When the crowd turned quiet, Grand Duke Kaliaf looked at Chun Yeowun and said…\n“You have a shameful attitude.”\n“Do you accept defeat?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s question, he smiled.\n“It's been a long time since someone looked down on the Grand Duke.”\n“This is nothing special.”\n“Yes. As you said, it isn’t special.”\nShh!\nGrand Duke Kaliaf tried to cover his face again. It wasn’t the other hand but the right hand which Chun Yeowun had cut off.\n‘That hand?’\nIt recovered in a short time. He knew that demons have a quick regeneration ability, but this wasn’t comparable to the demons he had seen.\nChun Yeowun moved quickly.\nPusk!\n“Kuak!”\nThe sword pierced in the Grand Duke’s shoulder was pushed in deeper. While in that state, Chun Yeowun tried to cut the hand of the Grand Duke again.\nAt that moment, the space around the Grand Duke’s body trembled and distorted. Then the sword that was used moved weirdly once more.\n“Did you think that the same trick would work on me again?”\n“Is that so?”\nAfterward, black energy fluttered from the sword blade.\nCreep!\nThe Grand Duke stretched out his hand towards Chun Yeowun at the terrifying energy he felt. The place Chun Yeowun stood changed.\n“Oh.”\nChun Yeowun’s vision, who was trapped inside, seemed to be in disarray. Meanwhile, the Grand Duke flew back and covered his face again with his hand.\nPsss!\nA sound of his nucleus moving was heard. The demonic power in him exploded, and the Grand Duke’s body transformed.\nHis whole body turned red like a burning flame, and his nose, mouth, and ears all disappeared. The only thing that remained on his face were his eyes.\nThe clothes he had on disappeared, and his muscular body turned red.\nShh!\nThe two swords of five attributes lodged in the shoulder had shattered. It wasn’t able to handle the demonic power of the Grand Duke.\nPang!\nAs he transformed, the air around felt like it was vibrating.\nEven their bodies trembled.\nGrrr!\nThe demons under his command looked at the Grand Duke and his power in awe and shouted at the excitement.\n“Wow!!!”\n“\nAdvance Awakening\nof the Grand Duke!”\nIt was their first time seeing it, except for the other demons that had lived long and high.\nAdvance Awakening —- an awakening that can only be done by those on the level close to the Demon King. It was truly astonishing.\nShhh!\nAt that time, Chun Yeowun, who seemed trapped in a distorted space, appeared outside.\nAnd the Grand Duke, who saw it, said.\n— You can even use space movement?\nThe marbling prison he created for Chun Yeowun was more than a barrier through which even the high-ranking demons couldn’t escape. However, it was easily escaped by this human.\n“Quite a nice ability. Make the space curved and stuff.”\nChun Yeowun, who had reached the Void Master level, was trapped inside and was able to grasp how the Grand Duke controlled space.\nThe Grand Duke said in a solemn voice as he looked at Chun Yeowun,\n— No wonder Duke Bevman was scared to bring you here. Good. I acknowledge it.\n“What do you mean?”\n— You deserve to compete with my full strength.\nPhat!\nThe Grand Duke's form vanished from where he was and materialized in front of Chun Yeowun as soon as he stated that. It was quite a surprising speed.\n‘Fast.’\nChun Yeowun extended his left arm to the side, and the Grand Duke’s kick flew through there.\nKwang! Papapapk!\nChun Yeowun was pushed back 20 meters after receiving the Grand Duke’s kick. That wasn’t the end.\nShhh!\nThe Grand Duke appeared on the other side and pushed him again. The Grand Duke hit Chun Yeowun, who was already forced back, but this time from above.\nChun Yeowun crossed both his arms to block it.\nKwang!\nAt that moment, the enormous destructive forces from the kick brought in a sinkhole in the ground for about 100 meters. A single kick destroyed One-third of the yard.\nThe demons, who witnessed it, bit their tongues.\n‘This is the true power of the Grand Duke.’\nWith just simple attacks, he was already making the most destruction. Grand Duke Kaliaf spoke to Chun Yeowun with joy, seeing him struggle to block.\n— Feel that? This is just 30% of the power I have. If I do my best, the entire castle will be destroyed.\nThe Grand Duke appeared to believe he had the upper hand once more. A word that his power is enormous.\n— I’ve been waiting for this moment—a combat battle with no weapons or tricks being used.\nAs he said, the Grand Duke didn’t use a spear. The spear was left elsewhere. He was too confident in his Advance Awakening.\nPhat!\nWhat made it worthwhile was that the power of the Grand Duke was beyond imagination. Chun Yeowun’s arms that were crossed were trembling, and the Grand Duke spoke again.\n— Is that all? Make it more fun. I have just begun…\n“You talk a lot.”\nPnag!\nThe body of the Grand Duke was thrown upwards. The eyes of the Grand Duke were shocked at the force.\n— Right! This is it! You too, come at me with all your…\nShh!\nBefore Grand Duke Kaliaf could finish his words, Chun Yeowun appeared in front of him and pulled his fist. At that moment, the space twisted. Beyond the warped space, Chun Yeowun’s fist had black energy on it.\n‘This?’\nThe Grand Duke’s eyes noticed that this back energy seemed like an abyss.\nThen Chun Yeowun said, “It’ll be troublesome not to kill you.”\n— What?\n— Kwang!\nWhen Chun Yeowun extended his fist, a tremendous amount of power exploded. The unification of the Spirit Beasts Energies and the Sky Demon Energy—a power that felt incomparable to any.\n— Kuak!\nThe Grand Duke clenched his fists with all his might, unconcerned about the palace or any harm it could do.\nKwaaang!\nWhen the fists of the two collided, a vital energy wave spread out all over the place.\nAs if dozens of layers of air had been created suddenly, gusts ran out, and the already far away demons were still thrown back.\nPapapak!\n“Kuak!”\n“Acck!”\nSome crashed through the wall. The only fine ones were the Duke and the Marquis level demons. However, they also had been pushed back.\n‘Is this his level?’\nDuke Bevman thought it was absurd. He believed that Chun Yeowun would also try to use that\nAwakening\nand fight like the Grand Duke, but he showed this force without even tapping into that\npower\n?\nPssss!\nThe results were surprising. It seemed like the wrist of the Grand Duke couldn’t withstand this power.\n‘It was worth it.’\nChun Yeowun looked at his fist. It looked like an average power, but when the unification of the Spirit Beasts Energies and the Sky Demon Energy was used along with the realization of the universe he got, it was a whole different level.\nShhh!\nThe Grand Duke’s arm that took damage was instantly back to its original form.\nHowever, the surprised Grand Duke said….\n— You are really amazing. You have skills that permit you to be arrogant. However, the fight is still unfinished!\nPhat!\nThe Grand Duke once again flew towards Chun Yeowun. Chun Yeowun also moved, and the two collided in the middle.\nBang!\nAnother layer of gust was created. The walls were utterly blown out this time.\n“Kuak!”\nSwish!\nAs they collided, the fist of the Grand Duke has shattered again.\n“Haaah!”\nThe Grand Duke endured the pain and tried to kick Chun Yeowun in the chest.\nBang!\nChun Yeowun, who didn’t see it coming, was hit and was moved back. In terms of attack, Chun Yeowun had the upper hand, but Grand Duke Kaliaf’s kick was quite strong and the blood dripping down from Chun Yeowun’s lips was proof of it.\nChun Yeowun, who was pushed, stopped himself in the air.\nPhat!\nAs Chun Yeowun stopped being pushed and rushed back again with his fist ready, the Grand Duke was also set to block and kick Chun Yeowun in the face.\nKwang!\nBoth their fists met once again. However, due to Chun Yeowun's power, the Grand Duke’s fists were destroyed once more.\nShhhh!\nThe Grand Duke’s arm, which bounced back due to the force and the loss of balance, was restored right away.\nIt could be said that this ability was what made him still alive.\nHe spoke excitedly.\n— Your punches are really great. However, I am slowly getting used to it. That blood on you is the proof.\nHe was the Grand Duke who managed to block or hit Chun Yeowun.\nChun Yeowun just wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth.\n— You may have a bit more power, but the difference in the regenerative power will determine the victory or defeat.\n“That decides the win or loss?”\n— The Grand Duke has the best regeneration among all the demons. Even the wounds which are fatal will be healed in a short time.\nGrand Duke Kaliaf raised his regenerating arm and said,\n— As time goes by, it gets worse for you. How are you going to deal…\n“I guess it wouldn’t matter much if one of the two hands is cut.”\n— What?\nIt was then…\nChun Yeowun drew a sword toward Grand Duke Kaliaf.\nAt that moment, Grand Duke felt a creepy feeling around.\nSlash!\nA black line appeared, and his left arm was severed in an instant. It happened so quickly that he didn’t even have the time to react.\n“Kuak!”\nThe severed arm fell to the ground. The Grand Duke could only look at it in confusion.\n— Was this your hidden trick? I told you that I have great regenerative…!?\nHis eyes trembled. He made sure to send the demonic power to heal his arm. Contrary to what he had expected, there was no response.\nThe black energy on the severed section prevented him from regenerating it.\n— W-what did you do?\nWhen the regenerative power he had his complete trust in didn’t work out, the Grand Duke lost his composure and was shocked.\nThe loss of an arm meant it was a devastating battle to have.\nTo him, Chun Yeowun spoke casually.\n“Consider it lucky that I stopped with just one arm.”\n“You!”\nA white light flashed from the Grand Duke’s angry eyes.\nDududud!\nThe entire space around Chun Yeowun began to bend. It wasn’t the same confinement space that he did initially but more like a space to kill Chun Yeowun by crushing him.\n“Didn’t you say the same trick won’t work on you again? I’ll say the same to you.”\nChun Yeowun drew his sword. Then the space curving around soon cracked and was back to normal.\nLooking at the wide eyes of the Grand Duke, it was definite that he was shocked.\n— W-what was that sword?\nThe Grand Duke was shocked that this sword managed to cut through everything.\nChun Yeowun answered.\n“Supreme Sky Demon Sword. There is nothing that this sword cannot cut.”\nSupreme Sky Demon Sword.\nOf all the techniques Chun Yeowun had, it could be said that this was the strongest and the best.\nThe single sword which destroyed and slashed everything was nothing short of an enemy to those with regenerative skills like Grand Duke Kaliaf.\nThe recovery wouldn’t happen.\nThe stunned Grand Duke looked at his severed arm in shock. After a while, he used the other hand to cover his face and then lowered it. After that, Advance Awakening was canceled, and he returned to his normal state.\nSwish!\nGrand Duke Kaliaf returned to the ground, and so did Chun Yeowun. His arrogant and confident appearance had fallen, and the demons under his command were saddened by their Lord's haggard face.\nLooking at Chun Yeowun, the Grand Duke spoke with a bitter face.\n“Was it said that there is a sky above the sky? I'm ashamed to have displayed such arrogance before such a strong man as you.”\nSurprisingly, the Grand Duke sincerely accepted the defeat. Without twisting his words, he admitted that he was weak.\nThud!\nThe Grand Duke knelt on one knee. And when he did that, those below him shouted in chaos.\n“Your Highness!”\n“Do not!”\nBecause they knew what this meant, as promised, he now acknowledges the defeat he faced and intends to swear allegiance to Chun Yeowun.\nSshh!\nGrand Duke raised his hand to calm those under him and said,\n“Don’t let me experience disgrace by saying such things. This wasn’t a promise by a noble, but as a warrior to another.”\n“Your Highness!”\nThe demons didn’t try speaking again. It was because of their loyalty to him. Chun Yeowun smiled faintly at that.\n‘No bad.’\nInitially, he planned to eradicate all the demons under this one's command, but then he changed his thoughts after seeing this.\nThe Grand Duke calmed them.\nWoong!\nThe space above the castle shook one after another, and many beings fell down. The number soon reached a little of fifty.\n“T-this?”\nThe demons under Grand Duke Kaliaf couldn’t hold their bewilderment at this. These people who fell all looked like demons with horns which meant they were high-ranking ones above the level of Marquis with awakening.\nIt wasn’t the end. The demons from outside the castle walls shouted.\n“E-enemy!!”\n“Enemy has appeared!”\nLike an army, several demons were gathering outside. The number seemed to be around five thousand. Seeing that, Grand Duke mumbled.\n“Are they aiming for it now?”\nHe knew from the number of troops what this meant.\nThese were the demons under the command of the aides of the Demon King. They were here to take advantage of the weakened state of the castle and the people from battle with Chun Yeowun.\nWoong!\nTwo beings with enormous power finally appeared from the sky.\nAnd when their faces were clearly visible along with the crushing power, Grand Duke Kaliaf’s expression contorted.\n“Deruan…!”\nDuke Deruan and Duke Legon.\nThey were the Dukes who were currently in their Advance Awakening form. Two of the four closest aides of the king have arrived here.\n‘Those people! They came here with a plan!’\nFrom the army surrounding them and the ones appearing in the Awakened forms, they were here with a solid plan to get what they wanted. The Grand Duke stood up and spoke to Chun Yeowun as if he felt bad.\n“I think that my swearing of allegiance should be pushed away for a while.”\nThen raised his hand to bring out Advance Awakening, but Chun Yeowun stopped him.\n“What are you doing? We don’t have the time for this now.”\nChun Yeowun smiled and said.\n“You are a lucky one.”\n“What are you saying….”\n“What a coincidence that you became my subordinate right when this happened.”\nShh!\nAfterward, Chun Yeowun covered his face with one hand and then lowered it.\nSwish!\nAt that moment, everything around felt like it was trembling and exploding simultaneously. Even the Grand Duke was pushed back by the force this man was released, and he was entirely dumbfounded at what he saw.\nThe Grand Duke’s eyes widened.\n‘!?’\nSuddenly, Chun Yeowun’s appearance changed from a human to pitch-black darkness.\nThe Grand Duke couldn't help but be shocked at the strange form, which looked like burning darkness.\n“A-Advance Awakening?”",

      "content": "Chapter 199: Ambush (2)\nTRA Alpha Satellite — a strategic weapon entity beyond the Gate which stole the sky from humans.\nThere was a gorgeous red castle five times the size of Grand Duke Kaliaf’s castle:\nThis was the castle of the Demon King, the head of the clan. In an annex within the castle, three figures were sitting around a round table.\nThese three were Dukes and had more dignity than the other demons standing around the table, who all were the Demon King’s or the associates. A map was spread open on the roundtable and red dots marked on it constantly moved.\n“The battle must have become fierce.”\nThe red dots on the map left the middle of the yard and moved. However, it turned around at one point.\nThe short blue haired Duke with thin eyes, known as Duke Deruan, asked the black haired demon with one eye closed who was making a strange expression,\n“Edhuy, how is the fight going?”\nThe black haired demon was Duke Edhuy, the demon who acted as the head and controlled the others. In contrast to the exotic appearances of the other Dukes, Duke Edhuy had a much more normal and reserved appearance..\n“The atmosphere is ripe.”\n“We’ll win?”\n“It isn’t clear. Far from that yet.”\nDuke Legion, a demon with thick lips and red hair, clicked his tongue as responding to his answer with pity..\n“It would have been nice to have a pawn on their side.”\n“The Grand Duke Kaliaf or one the two dukes would have noticed a pawn. This is best.”\nHearing Duke Deruan’s words, Duke Legion smiled and pointed at the board, saying,\n“Now, only Bevman is left.”\n“Huhuhu, you’re right.”\nSurprisingly, they knew the details of the fight happening at Duke Kaliaf’s castle in real time, as if watching it unfold with their own eyes.\nIn the center, Duke Edhuy, their leader, sat with one of his eyes closed, looking somewhere beyond the confines of the room.\n“This is shocking.”\n“What’s shocking?”\n“Grand Duke Kaliaf is being pushed back.”\nThe two dukes were shocked by those words, as Duke Kaliaf wasn’t just anyone.\nEveryone had confirmed his and seen his power firsthand in the Third War.\n“Huh? The Grand Duke’s being pushed back?”\n“Just who is the one doing that?”\nThe two dukes wondered about the identity of the human who was able to push back the Grand Duke. Duke Edhuy then ordered them,\n“Get ready.”\nAfter the order was given, the faces of the two Dukes seemed thrilled and lit up.\n“The battle is over?”\n“Yes.”\nIn response, the two Dukes stood up.\n“This is an opportunity of a lifetime.”\n“Let’s leave!”\nWith their armor equipped, they looked like generals heading off to war, which was a pretty accurate description. Prepared for battle, they walked out of the annex.\nWhen they left the annex, they saw about two thousand demons lined up outside. Judging from their weapons and attire, it was clear that they were all prepared for war.\n“Hahhhhhhh!!!”\nTheir morale was great, fitting for the battle that would determine the future of their clan.\n-Is he the one?\nDuke Legion, who wanted to be certain, asked Duke Deruan who was next to him. Duke Deruan nodded.\n-I think so.\nThe person they were looking at was Chun Yeowun. As soon as they had arrived, they sought out his location, as they considered him the strongest human.\n‘Apparently, a human defeated the Grand Duke…’\nThe appearance of the Grand Duke without an arm was proof of the feat. They exchanged glances with each other, a pre-briefing and confirmation of Duke Edhuy’s plan.\n[The current situation is that the confrontation between the Grand Duke and the man is over. Both are likely to be exhausted, so we will never get such a chance again.]\nThat was the gist of the situation, which the Dukes saw as a golden opportunity to not only deal with the thorns in their side but also to retrieve Arisha’s weapons.\n-Shall we start?\n-Of course.\nDuke Deruan and Duke Legion simultaneously stretched out their hands, which was also done by the fifty or so Marquis-ranked demons in the air with them.\n[When entering the sky above the castle, fire at the yard with the best long-distance skills you can muster. Aim especially for the Grand Duke and his men.]\nThis was Duke Edhuy’s order; it was an operation that aimed to take advantage of surprise.\nWoong!\nSwoosh! Wheik!\nThe demons began to fill the sky above the castle with various weapons and numerous spheres of energy.\nOnce the two Dukes and the Marquis-level demons had all awakened, the two dukes displayed their power with all their might, making the sky seem as if it was going to rain with despair.\n“T-this…”\nThe demons under Grand Duke Kaliaf’s command couldn’t hide their shock at the countless weapons, lightning, and spheres filling the sky. It was an unexpected situation; since this attack started when their Grand Duke and Chun Yeowun were fighting, nearly half of the castle’s defense was down.\n“H-How can we stop them?”\nThe demons didn’t know what to do.\n“Everyone move away!”\n“Avoid it!”\nThe Marquis demons shouted, realizing that the massive attacks that covered the sky couldn’t be stopped.\nRunning away was the only way to reduce the damage, but then:\nPaah!\nA strong wind pressure arose from somewhere, along with an immense energy.\nDuke Bevman’s eyes widened in shock as he wondered if the incoming attack had already reached them.\n‘Ah!’\nA figure then stood against the attack, looking as if the darkness was burning like a flame. It was none other than Chun Yeowun, whose pressure was as strong as that of a Grand Duke-class demon.\nHowever, would he be enough to handle the attack?\n‘Is he the one?’\nThe Demon King’s aides in the sky all thought the same thing, refusing to take their eyes off Chun Yeowun and Grand Duke Kaliaf.\nTheir eyes became sharper as they observed Chun Yeowun for a long time.\n“He seems quite strong. I thought it was a joke.”\n“He must have lived long.”\nDuke Edhuy had already informed them that Chun Yeowun could use Advance Awakening, so even if they were surprised to see it themselves, there wouldn’t be any hesitation.\n“This will probably be useless.”\n“It’s already too late. Attack them!”\nThe Marquis-class demons, who awakened simultaneously as ordered by Duke Deruan, displayed their best long-distance skills instantaneously as their skills filled the sky above the castle.\nPapapak!\nIt was indeed a dire situation for those near the castle.\n“Avoid it!”\nIt was at that moment that all the demons under Grand Duke Kaliaf were filled with terror and spread out in every direction. Chun yeowun, who was in his Advance Awakening state, raised his hands towards the sky.\nThe two Dukes saw him and laughed.\n“Idiots.”\n“Isn’t it too late for him to escape!?”\nAt that moment, a shocking change occurred in the air, which warped the attacks.\nKwak!\nThe normal space was distorted as a strong force twirled around like a tornado. The distortion was the size of the entire courtyard, so it looked as if a huge black hole had formed in the air.\n“This isn’t just for show.”\n“Right, try blocking it!”\nSeeing the spatial distortion, the two Dukes raised their power even further, determined to break past it. Contrary to their will, however:\nPapapak!\nTheir best attacks were all sucked into the tornado-like space, along with the attacks of the awakened Marquis.\n‘No way!’\n‘The attacks are being absorbed?!’\nDespite looking at it, all of the demons in the sky found the scene hard to believe. The outcome was completely different from what they had expected: the attacks of the two awakened Dukes and the fifty awakened Marquises were all blocked by one human.\n-This makes no sense.\n-How?\nThe two Dukes were dumbfounded as the distorted space returned to its original state.\nSwoosh!\nSeeing this all unfold, the demons in the courtyard were also shocked by Chun Yeowun’s power.\n“Holy…”\n“H-he blocked it.”\n“H-How, a human?”\nDuke Legion couldn’t understand it.\n‘He protected them?’\nDuke Deruan couldn’t understand.\n‘No way. They were just confronting one another in a fight, but now they are helping each other?’\nThen, everyone saw Chun Yeowun slightly bend his knees and jumped up.\nIt was strange; although he had only slightly bent his knees before jumping, the pressure was comparable to that of a rocket launch.\nKwaang!\nChun Yeowun, who was in his True Awakened form, jumped up, and at that moment, the floor of the yard collapsed in a 100 meter range as it was shattered by the mere force.\n“He's coming!”\n“Everyone spread out and attack him!”\nPhat!\nThe demons dispersed in all directions and tried to focus all their attacks on Chun Yeowun, who was ascending. However, Chun Yeowun’s appearance soared past them and faded into the sky.\nEven the two Dukes, who were intensely observing him, couldn’t see where he went.\nAt that moment, something passed by at a tremendous speed past the demons. Although it seemed that a wave of wind had just brushed past their bodies, the Marquises were pushed over.\nPapang!\n“Euk!”\n“Ugh!”\nAll of them had black smoke coming out of their mouth as if they were damaged, but some suffered worse injuries.\nShhh!\nThe eight Marquises who were closest to the wind and were standing in a line had scattered like ashes.\n‘This?!’\nDuek Deruan had tried to look at the thing that had passed by, but it was to no avail. Chun Yeowun, who had unleashed his Advance Awakening, was higher than them in the sky and was looking down with an arrogant expression as if he was God.\nDuke Deruan, who had great vision, moved to catch up to Chun Yeowun\n“You bastard!”\nHe spread his arms as his body turned into flame, which resembled lava much more.\nThe hottest among the demons was Duke Deruan.\nI’ll turn you to ashes.\nDuke Deruan, who was ascending with lava around his body, rushed to close the gap between him and Chun Yeowun. At the same time, Chun Yeowun raised his hand towards the incoming man.\nSwoosh!\nThe moment Duke Deruan came close enough,\nPaaah!\nChun Yeowun smashed Duke Deruan, who was in a lava state, with his palm.\n‘I can hold on! I can endure this!’\nDuke Deruan clenched his teeth. He could melt the hand that was holding him if he had enough patience.\nHe was confident that he wouldn’t lose, but:\nBang!\nKwak!\nThe moment Duke Deruan collided with Yeowun’s palm, his body was swept away by the huge force and his entire body was suddenly crushed by the resulting tremendous pressure.\nPsss!\nDuke Legion and the remaining Marquises were astonished.\n‘Deruan, after unleashing his Advance Awakening, was defeated in one hit?’\nIt was unbelievable. Naturally, they all thought that their ally was strong, but the difference in power seemed too large to ignore.\nThe moment Chun Yeowun killed Duke Deruan, he reached out to the rest of the floating demons.\n“Everyone! Move away!”\nDuke Legion judged that the human was targeting them and hurriedly shouted to the Marquises.\nThe Marquises, who felt the sense of crisis as well, flew in every single direction.\nWheik!\nAt that moment, a sword with black flames appeared around Chun Yeowun. Although there were hundreds of demons, the moment the swords appeared, Duke Legion felt goosebumps all over his body.\n‘This is bad! Really bad!’\nHe flew without looking back as his instincts told him to run as far as he could from this crisis.\nIt was then.\nPuak!\nSomething pierced his stomach.\n“Kuak!”\nDuke Legion stared at what had pierced his stomach: it was a sword with black flame.\nThe sword of black flame that pierced the body moved with great speed in a line.\n“D-Damn it!”\nDuke Legion turned the other way to avoid the sword that was aiming for him again.\nPuck!\nSomething passed through his face this time: the same sword!\nThe sword with black flame that had pierced his face moved again and hit the chest another time. It then kept piercing the Duke’s entire body.\nThe sword with black flames destroyed Duke Legion’s body the same way that piranhas eat their prey.\n‘!!’\nAll the demons looking at the sky from the yard were speechless.\nGrand Duke Kaliaf, an old war veteran, mumbled,\n“Is this… real?”\nSlash! Slash!\nWith his eyes, he could see the sword with black flames constantly moving by the black trails it left as it destroyed the awakened demons.\n“Kuak!”\n“Ack!”\nPsss!\nEven those who were running away were being swept away by the sword and as they promptly dispersed into ashes.\nThe air, which had been filled with demons moments before, was now filled with ashes.\nDestroying everything in an instant was impossible; even Grand Duke Kaliaf couldn’t understand what had just happened\n‘He wasn’t using his true power?’",

      "content": "Chapter 200: Ambush (3)\n[Editor — Angel bows down to the almighty Chun Yeowun—Demon God, Second Chun Ma, and the 24th Lord of the Sky Demon Order.]\nChun Ma — nothing is known about his origins, except that at the age of 18, he attained the greatest level of martial arts and overthrew all famous masters with only one blade, and was hailed later as the \"World’s Best Warrior.\"1\nOverwhelming power.\nIt was an incomparable power when it has directly struck the opponent.\nGrand Duke Kaliaf’s surprise was short-lived as his face darkened.\n‘Dark… flame…’\nA memory he had forgotten came to his mind. At that moment, he felt a shiver run down his spine.\n‘Why did I forget about it?’\nDarkness itself. The spark which set everything on fire. It was ferocious, all-consuming terror.\n‘Arisha?’\nAt that time, Chun Yeowun looked somewhere and raised his hand. He pulled on something as if he was ripping it.\nEveryone wondered what he would do next and couldn’t hide their surprise.\n“L-look over there!”\n“What is that?”\nCrack!\nThe sound of the sky being torn could be heard—the loud sound even hurt the ears of the demons.\nAs the space was torn, a place filled with darkness was revealed, which brought out a sharp sense.\nCrack!\nChun Yeowun stretched out his hand, pretending to pull something. Something sharp and warping the space spilled out of the ripped sky at that instant, like a massive wave.\n‘Spatial Sword.’\nThe Spatial Sword could be achieved if one ascended to the Void Master level. Its scale couldn’t even be compared to what Hwang-heol, the last alive subordinate of Blade God, said.\nChachacak!\nThe Spatial Sword rains down like a downpour. The place it was headed to was none other than the outskirts of the western side. It was pouring at the five thousand elite demon army that arrived earlier and was now stationed outside the fortress.\nWhisper!\nThe demons looked confused. Marquis Laud, the commander of their group, was waiting for the signal, but something weird was emanating from the castle.\n“W-what is that?”\nA sharp sense of something moving could be felt from the torn sky. It was tough to put it into words.\nHowever, there was just one thing he knew.\n‘It’s dangerous!’\nAs the swords were rushing in at great speed, Marquis Laud shouted.\n“Troops! Retreat!”\nThe demons staring up in wonder ran at once when they heard this command. It wasn’t a situation where they could appreciate the enemy's strength.\nThe only way to survive would be to run fast.\nChachachacha!\nIt was like a tsunami of swords. The Spatial Swords poured down from the castle and swept them all instantly. It was a different kind of swept away from the waves.\n“Kuak!”\n“Ack!”\nThey turned into shreds as soon as the Spatial Swords crashed on their bodies. Their nuclei were greatly destroyed, which turned them into ashes. Even Marquis Laud was no exception.\n“W-what is thi….”\nPssss!\nNo one there could prevent what was happening. Everything had to burn down in the place where the Spatial Sword was moving like a tsunami.\nThe demons watching it from the other sides were at a loss for words.\nThey felt chills run down their spines as they watched five thousand elite demons vanishing into thin air without a fight.\n“I-is this the power of a human?”\n“… what are you saying? That isn’t a human. What kind of human can do the Advanced Awakening which\nonly\nGrand Dukes can do?”\n“Then, he’s from our clan?”\nThe demons no longer thought of Chung Yeowun as a human. Perhaps they even question whether he was an existence that the clan had hidden.\nPsss!\nThe last remaining demons were killed. The western side of the castle now only had ashes on the ground.\nThe atmosphere was so strange. Until recently, they were hostile towards each other.\nHowever, when all the demons led by the Demon King’s aides came, Chun Yeowun helped eradicate them, and the demons who felt happy shouted at once.\n“Woahhhh!!”\n“Risha! Risha! Risha!”\nThe demons, who didn’t know Chun Yeowun’s name, shouted Risha while looking at him in the air.\nIt was a shout calling him a hero.\nChun Yeowun looked at his hand, which had the black flame.\n‘… definitely, beyond the human level.’\nIt was his, but the power felt like it transcended the human level. He didn’t know that the power of the Spatial Sword could be raised to that level. For him, this was just a chance to test how much he would do if he used the Advanced Awakening, and the result was beyond imagination.\n‘It will be difficult to control.’\nHe felt that he was getting too powerful. He wondered if he would ever find someone who could fight him on equal footing.\nHe soon covered his face with his hand.\nSwoosh!\nHe then turned back into his original state after lowering his hand. In his human form, he suddenly felt weak, like he was punched all over his body.\nTremble!\nHis body was shaking so much that he could feel it without looking at himself. There definitely was a risk of using the Advanced Awakening. However…\n[The overload of the muscles will be handled.]\nAs the nanomachines in the body were activated, they expanded and relaxed the muscles that felt like they would explode anytime.\nEven the five spirits core in him helped this. The horrible after-effects of the awakening subsided in just a few seconds.\n‘… maybe plain fatigue.’\nHe didn’t know much but decided to consider it as fatigue. Even so, it could be said that the risk was small compared to the result, and it felt like his body had slightly been drained after it.\nShhh!\nAfter the aftereffects got better, Chun Yeowun moved down to the inner side of the yard, which had been intact when he first arrived but was now a mess. However, the faces of the demons were bright. It was because there wasn’t even a single casualty among them, and the ones who suffered were the opponents.\n“Wahhh!!!”\n“Risha! Risha!”\nThey shouted\nRisha\nto Chun Yeowun as he was coming down. Chun Yeowun frowned at their never-seen enthusiastic cheers.\n“Risha?”\nIt sounded like the demon language, but he had no idea what it meant. At that time, Grand Duke Kaliaf, Duke Bevman, and the other high-ranking demons serving them approached.\nChun Yeowun said to them,\n“You are lucky. Did I say it before? I eradicated the other, taking the side of one enemy.”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf answered with a smile.\n“How could we be Risha’s enemy?”\n“I keep hearing that\nRisha\n… What does Risha even mean?”\nIt was Duke Bevman who answered that question.\n“Word for the best warrior in the clan.”\n“Best warrior?”\nOnly then did the question of why the demons shouted Risha have been resolved. The demons who were warlike and skilled in battle admired excellent warriors.\nThey recognized Chun Yeowun as the best of them.\n“Stellar.”\nChun Yeowun snorted at it. He didn't hate this. Grand Duke Kaliaf bowed on one knee and said,\n“I will repeat the oath of allegiance.”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf was about to repeat the oath, but it didn’t stop there.\nThud!\nDuke Bevman and the other high-ranking demons also fell to their knees.\nAll the demons around them, even those on the watchtower, bowed their heads as they got down on their knees.\nGrand Duke Kaliaf shouted.\n“Grand Duke Kaliaf acknowledged the defeat and swears the oath of allegiance to Risha according to the law of our clan.”\nAll the demons then shouted along.\n“We swear on the oath of allegiance!!!”\nThey all shouted in a loud voice. Grand Duke Kaliaf wasn’t alone in it. All the demons under Grand Duke swore to Chun Yeowun.\nThis wasn’t something to be taken lightly. Among the numerous demons, one-quarter of the power went under him. Grand Duke Kaliaf smiled and spoke to Chun Yeowun.\n“Risha. You have a huge group of us under you.”\n“\nKuaaah!\n”\nKwang!\nThe round table shattered.\nIt was Duke Edhuy who destroyed it. He was rational and cold-hearted compared to the other Dukes, but the disastrous results caused this rageful behavior.\nBang! Bang!\nDuke Edhuy destroyed anything he could see. With his force razing, nothing in the annex would be left alone.\n“\nKuaaah!\nThat damned human bastard! He changed everything!”\nThere was no way he could get himself to understand what had happened.\nThree of his close associates were killed. Although it was a bit unreasonable, he used 70% of his force under the judgment that this situation would be the best for them, but everything had gone wrong.\nAs a result, the balance which had been narrowly achieved was shattered.\n“Phew…”\nDuke Edhuy, who was destroying the annex, stopped and gradually regained composure. It wasn’t possible to reverse the situation with his anger.\n‘If the Grand Duke is advancing to the Demon King, then there is no way to stop it.’\nThere was no need to wait and collect all of Arisha’s Armor.\nWith the power on his side, the Grand Duke could have moved at any time and executed him and the others, and he would have been able to take the throne without the armor.\n‘But that won’t happen because of his personality.’\nAlthough they were fighting against each other now, he had known Grand Duke Kaliaf for many years.\nHe will never move against the laws of the clan. Even for the sake of leading the demons, he will make sure to follow the process the right way.\nThis wasn’t a guess.\nThe only variable would be the unknown human being who came in.\n‘How can a human have Advanced Awakening?’\nBesides, the power the human had was beyond imagination. Duke Edhuy couldn’t have imagined that a human would eradicate all the demons under him.\n‘What was it? Was that even possible? Was Arisha’s Sword that capable?’\nHe didn’t know that a human could use Advanced Awakening. Now the question was how the Awakening would help the human.\nThat nonsensical power… was even beyond the level that no one other than the Demon King could tackle.\n‘If not the Demon King, then?’\nIt was that moment when something crossed his mind.\nA secret is known to those close to the Demon King knew. And now, only he knew.\n‘Demon King…’\nDuke Edhuy shook his head after a brief pause.\n‘No. That is too much. It’s a position we barely managed to get… if it is awakened, then it will be impossible to fix.’\nDuke Edhuy seemed troubled by something.\nAs a strategist, he made numerous assumptions on what to do but couldn’t come up with an answer.\nA plan was also devised to move the other two Grand Dukes. However, if he moved without a suitable method, he would only be throwing a good one as prey to the wolf.\n“\nKuah!\n”\nTime was running out.\nUnless the Grand Duke was an idiot, they would also plan a move. Duke Edhuy, who contemplated for a long time, moved and headed somewhere.\nIt was the heart of the Demon King’s castle. After entering the castle, he went into the Demon King’s room and looked at the enormous empty red throne.\n“\nPhew.\n”\nTaking a deep breath, he approached the throne. Then he passed the throne and strode straight towards the wall behind.\nHowever, his body went through the wall.\nWoong!\nPassing through the wall revealed a hidden dark space. He was now the only one in the clan who knew of this secret.\nAs he entered that space, a dark bright light flowed from the wall, illuminating the surrounding. And there came a staircase leading to the basement.\nStep! Step!\nThe sound of footsteps reverberated around as he went down the stairs.\nAfter going down for a while, a chamber can be seen. A bright light came from the ceiling and walls, illuminating the interior.\nBubble!\nThere was the sound of something boiling. A huge glass tube appeared in front of Duke Edhuy. There was a blue liquid up to the lip of the tube, and something in the shape of a seal was placed on it.\nBubble!\nThe bubbles were coming out of the mouth of the man inside the tube. His form has no arms and legs, and a third of his torso was also blown off. It was just the head and chest that remained.\nInside, something like a black rise was tightly wrapped around the tiny body as if it was in a cocoon. The only area exposed was the nose and mouth.\nShhh!\nDuke Edhuy glanced at the black armor on his waist and thighs; it was completely different from the other pieces of armor he had on.\nDuke Edhuy mumbled as he touched the tube.\n“… can I really control it?”\nThere was uncertainty in his eyes. He wasn’t sure if this choice would make a lot of difference.\nDuke Edhuy, who had been standing in front of the glass tube, finally made a decision and moved closer.\n“This is a gamble of a lifetime.”\nAt the same time, in a hallway inside the castle of Grand Duke Kaliaf. Chun Yeowun was following the Grand Duke. He had been following him since the Grand Duke had asked for some of his time.\nA massive door was in front of them after they had reached the end of the hallway. The Grand Duke touched the ruby stone in the middle of the enormous door with his palm, and a light shone from the ruby as the door opened.\nKiik!\nThe door opened with a sound and musty smell. It meant that the inside hadn’t been cleaned for a while. As soon as they entered, lights shone from the walls and brightened the place.\n“Hmm.”\nIt was quite a large room full of many antique-like things, from armors to statues in unusual forms and books.\n“Why did you bring me here?”\n“To answer the question.”\n“Question?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s response, Grand Duke walked further into the room and pointed his finger at the huge picture hanging on the wall.\nThe frame was full of dust and hard to see.\nShh! Wheing!\nWhen Chun Yeowun slightly waved his hand, the wind blew the dust away from the frame and gathered in one place.\nThen came the frame clearly visible to them. The frame seemed to be a painting of someone.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun’s expression changed when he saw the one in it.\n“… what is this?”\n“What you asked.”\nThe painting was clearly of\nsomeone\n. However, it was\nsomeone\nwho was wearing black armor, Arisha’s Armor.\nIt wasn’t because of the armor that Chun Yeowun reacted like this. It was because the face of the person wearing the armor wasn’t in the form of a human or demon with a face but in blazing black flames.\n“Answer my question. What is this?”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf answered most politely.\n“This… this here is the portrait of Arisha.”\n?1? Nano Machine",

      "content": "Chapter 201: Bamut Underground Prison (1)\n“A portrait of Arisha?”\nChun Yeowun looked at the portrait with surprise and doubt.\nThe face that was a blazing flame resembled the appearance of his Advanced Awakening, but Chun Yeowun couldn’t understand why Arisha had the same form.\n“Isn’t Arisha a God?”\nChun Yeowun was a member of the Sky Demon Order, meaning that he also worshipped a Demon although his God was absolute.\nHe was even considered the Demon God because he had a position that other humans couldn’t reach.\n“God… does this term refer to the transcendent being that humans speak of?”\n“Right.”\n“Hmm… from whom did Master hear about Arisha?”\n“Shakena.”\n“Shakena? The Heart Hunter?”\nThe Grand Duke looked like he was trying to remember anything he knew about Shakena. Actually, although he was a Grand Duke and didn’t take note of any demons of Count title or lower, he was aware of Shakena because she was known for her Phasing ability.\n“Did you bring that child?”\nHe asked with a bit of anticipation.\nHe and the other Grand Dukes coveted her, but she constantly refused to obey anyone other than the Demon King’s command.\n“Master is truly blessed with talent. It is rare for that child to come under one’s command.”\n“…”\nHe spoke calmly, but an underlying bitterness could be felt. Unexpectedly, it seemed like Grand Duke Kaliaf liked to joke around lightly. In fact, this was why the demons under his command followed him so willingly.\n“Why does it matter whom I heard it from?”\n“I guess the current generation thinks of Arisha’s existence that way.”\n“What do you mean?”\nIn response to Chun Yeowun’s question, Grand Duke Kaliaf stood in front of the frame.\n“We have a very close relationship with the planet Earth, probably because Earth was the first place our gate opened to.”\n“I didn’t know that.”\nWhile they talking about Arisha, the topic of Earth had come out, intriguing Chun Yeowun.\nAt Chun Yeowun’s response, Grand Duke approached a bookshelf near the frame and pulled out a book.\nThe book was written in English and not the demon language.\n“Conscious beings form language and writing to express their will and leave records. And such a language system forms a culture which soon grows into a tribe or a group.”\n“So?”\n“It is the same with our clan. Naturally, the clan created its own language.”\nAnd he pulled out another book, which had words Chun Yeowun couldn’t understand.\nThe language written looked similar to what was written on the scroll with Arisha’a armor.\n“I think the current generation will soon start using the language of Earth with ours and create a natural flow.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Arisha… we now call it that out of convenience, but it was supposed to be called Larisha.”\n“Larisha?”\n“It’s difficult to pronounce, so we naturally called it Arisha, as our warlike clan has long revered the darkness and fire.”\n“Hmm.”\nAt that, Chun Yeowun felt a strange familiarity.\nThe Sky Demon Order, too, revered a Demon as its sacred image.\nThe word Demon meant ‘evil’ for the Sky Demon Order, but it also meant ‘of darkness’.\n“Where do you think Larisha came from?”\nHearing the Grand Duke’s question, Chun Yeowun thought of ‘Risha’, which seemed familiar.\nRisha was none other than the nickname that the other demons were calling him.\n“Didn’t you say that\nRisha\nmeant the best warrior of your clan?”\n“Right. But\nRisha\nmeans ‘fire’, before being a warrior.”\n“Fire?”\n“Our clan thinks the best warrior is a hot, burning flame.”\nWith that, Chun Yeowun looked at the portrait again, and opened his mouth when he looked at the black flame wearing the armor.\n“Then the\nLa\nmeans darkness?”\n“Correct, you’re smarter than I thought. It means darkness and fear.”\n“So that’s why this being is called Larisha?”\n“Right.”\nLarisha, or rather Arisha, literally meant ‘Black Flame’ to the demon clan, and realizing this, Chun Yeowun could guess the Grand Duke’s intention now.\nThe Grand Duke had told him that Arisha’s existence didn’t mean the God he thought, but actually referred to someone who had actually existed.\n“Today’s generation doesn’t know all of this. Larisha….No, Arisha is a legendary being in our clan who became a symbol.”\nAs if remembering something, Grand Duke Kaliaf looked at the portrait.\n“Larisha used to exist… is what you’re trying to say?”\n“Right, which is why i wanted to answer your question.”\n“My question…”\nThis only made Chun Yeowun more curious.\nWhy was the form in this portrait in the same as his Advanced Awakening? It felt too similar to be a coincidence.\n“Then, answer what I asked.”\n“Even this Grand Duke doesn’t know.”\nChun Yeowun snorted at those words. It had only been a few hours since he even learned of Advanced Awakening, but now was fully engrossed in its underlying significance.\n“This time I’ll ask. If a demon named Arisha actually existed—whoever they were—then why are they now a legend?”\n“Arisha is the predecessor of the Demon King.”\n“Predecessor the Demon King?”\nChun Yeowun didn’t see this coming.\nThe demons themselves were old, so of course they had age-old ancestors. However, Chun Yeowun had overlooked just one thing: their life.\n“The same Demon King who has ruled the clan for eight thousand years.”\n“Eight\nthousand\n?”\nChun Yeowun’s was surprised: the lifespan of the demons was unimaginable for a human.\nChun Yeowun, with his immortality, could definitely live that long, but it was still amazing to hear.\n“Wow, he’s lived for a long time.”\n“Huhuhu, even I, the Grand Duke, have lived for more than five thousand years.”\n“Five thousand… Huh?!”\nThe lifespan of demons was strangely long. The reason Grand Duke Kaliaf must have thought of himself as the candidate of the Demon King was because he lived the longest.\nHis longevity was a sign of strength and comfort to the clan.\n“Why does Master think that I wanted to have a conversation with you like this for?”\nChun Yeowun looked around. He could feel the entire castle with his senses but couldn’t hear anything; the place was soundproofed.\n“Is the answer something that shouldn’t leave this place?”\nGrand Duke nodded.\n“Arisha is just a myth for the demons in the current generation, but for me, Arisha is a thing of the past.”\n“What are you trying to say?”\n“Arisha suddenly disappeared.”\n“Disappeared?”\n“Actually, this is something I heard from our current Demon King, who was a Grand Duke at the time.”\nThe current Demon King who disappeared used to hold the Grand Duke title.\nThe current generation of demons knew that he was someone recognized by the previous Demon King and inherited the title from them, but the truth wasn’t known by many.\n“The current King had said that Arisha no longer existed and that he inherited Arisha’s power.”\nThe Demon King’s position was a result of ignoring all the laws and procedures.\nUsing the King’s precedent, Kaliaf was a candidate for the Demon King. According to the law, the greatest warrior must challenge the Demon King in a battle held by the Grand Dukes.\nWhen the challenger’s power was recognized, the succession was then prepared.\n“So what happened?”\n“It’s as you can guess.”\n“You just allowed it?”\n“There was no way for me to to allow it or not.”\nThe clan was at war at the time, as they weren’t the only strong clain on their planet: there was another clan with almost as much power as them.\n“We had been going through a long war with Talisha’s clan, and it was so fierce that if the balance had been shaken just a little, we would have collapsed.”\nTalisha’s clan.\nThey were known as the white, or pure, ones.\nDuring the war between clans for power on the planet, the demons decided that it would be dangerous if one of the Grand Duke didn't follow the rules and had a battle with the Demon King, so Kaliaf had to accept the results.\n“It also wouldn’t have been a fair fight. Aside from what happened, he had inherited the spirit of Arisha within him and was already being called the Dragon King.”\nGrand Duke Kalaif was smart, and it was only because of his good judgement that the clan had survived this long.\nOf course, many sacrifices were made along the way.\n“After the end of the third long war with that clan, I decided that I wanted to try to uncover the hidden truth.”\n“Uncover the hidden truth… why would you do that?”\n“Arisha was someone I truly admired. It was hard to believe that such an existence would just get up and disappear without a word.”\nOut of his own curiosity, he investigated Arisha’s traces and tried to figure out all the deeds of the previous Demon King that would lead to a reason for him to disappear.\nBut, it was too late to find any worthy leads. Due to the long war, Arisha’s supporters were killed and those in the royal castle were all under the current Demon King.\n“The Demon King noticed that I was moving differently and warned me.”\n“You mean no more searching?”\n“Right.”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf hadn’t ignored that warning; the war was basically over, but because too many in the clan had died, rebuilding would take a long time and he needed to devote his efforts to helping the clan..\nIn the midst of it, Grand Duke Kaliaf knew that if he decided to look beyond his doubts and uncover the truth, the internal riots would destroy the clan.\n‘He has the qualities of agood leader.’\nChun Yeowun understood that much about the Grand Duke. Although they had only known one another for a couple hours, Grand Duke Kaliaf was by no means the type to avoid fighting or death just because he was afraid of something.\nTherefore, he must have been seriously worried about the clan to heed the Demon King’s warning.\n“Well, you didn’t really have any leads to find Arisha anyways.”\n“That’s not all.”\n“What?”\n“At that time, there was a strange rumor going around.”\n“Rumor?”\n“The rumor came from one of his aides who claimed that Arisha abandoned this planet and left for another planet.”\n“Another planet?”\nUpon hearing the rumor, the Grand Duke tried to find out who this information came from. However, despite the Grand Duke’s searching extensively for the source, the aide’s existence had suddenly vanished.\nBecause the Demon King decreed that those who spread false rumors would be punished by law, no one talked about it again.\nListening to the Grand Duke, Chun Yeowun clicked his tongue.\n“So in the end, you couldn’t find anything certain about Arisha’s whereabouts?”\nNo solid evidence or information was found; the Grand Duke, who seemed embarrassed at his incompetence, stroked his beard.\n“\nAhem\n. Unfortunately, that was the end result. But considering the Demon King’s reaction, I thought that the rumors that Arisha disappeared made sense.”\n“You mean about Arisha leaving for another planet?”\n“Yes.”\nAt that, Chun Yeowun frowned and said,\n“So where are you going with this? You think that I am that Arisha who left to another planet?”\n“…”\nThe Grand Duke didn’t answer and just looked Chun Yeowun in the eye. His eyes weren’t confident, revealing that he did have some doubts.\n“Unfortunately, that isn’t the case. I was born on Earth and my mother and father were humans,” Chun Yeowun said.\n“Earth…You were born there?”\n“Yes.”\nHearing Chun Yeowun’s confirmation, the Grand Duke's eyes fluttered. Seeing the seriousness in Chun Yeowun’s eyes, he was convinced that Chun Yeowun could be related to Arisha, but now he was completely flustered.\n‘Ha... No way...”\nWith a serious expression, the Grand Duke asked.\n“Then why is Master, a human from Earth, gathering Arisha’s weapons?”\nThis was the second reason that convinced the Grand Duke: the weapons of Arisha that Chun Yeowun had. At first he thought Chun Yeowun only had the sword and wheel, but he was shocked to learn that he in fact had five of them.\n“Hmm...”\nHearing the Grand Duke’s question, Chun Yeowun fell into thought.\nAfter seeing the drawing in Hagar's safe, Chun Yeowun had decided to collect them, and he was quite faithful to his greed.\nHowever, it would be difficult for Chun Yeowun to explain that his desire came from greed and the way he acquired the weapons were unexpected in most cases because he never deliberately went anywhere to find them.\nEverything had occurred by chance.\n‘Coincidence…’\nWasn’t it said that if coincidences overlapped, then it must be fate?\nAs if the weapons were meant to be owned by Chun Yeowun from the beginning, they kept finding their way to him, starting with the Sky Demon Sword.\n‘This is strange.’\nIt felt like he was unlocking something hidden inside his mind.\nGrand Duke Kaliaf had inquired about it in a way that caused ripples within the calm lake that was Chun Yeowun’s mind.\nWoong!\nA red light flashed from the entrance of the room, causing Grand Duke Kaliaf to take a deep breath and say,\n“\nPhew\n, we’ll talk about this later. It seems like a guest has arrived.”\nWhen Grand Duke Kaliaf opened the door, Duke Bevman was standing there with a puzzled face, prompting the Grand Duke to ask.\n“Bevman, didn’t you say you were going to Bamut?”\nAfter the oath, Bevman did lead some of the forces to the underground prison to save his daughter Marquis Irene, so why he was here?\nThud!\nGoing down on one knee, Duke Bevman asked,\n“Your Highness, please help me.”\n“What happened?”\n“The field to enter Bamut isn’t opening.”\n“It isn’t opening?”\nThe field, or force field, was the location of the entrance to the prison.\nThe force field wasn’t artificially created but rather a natural phenomenon that occurred at the entrance to the canyon where this dungeon was naturally formed. Originally, the force field was opened using a special device.\n“The force field seems to have gotten stronger.”\n“Hmm...”\nAt those words, Grand Duke Kalaif couldn’t hide the shock on his face. The force field caused by the planet’s natural movement was a collection of energy so great that even the Grand Duke couldn’t penetrate it.\nEven if they could use all of their energy to go in, they wouldn’t be able to come out.\nChun Yeowun said,\n“Can’t we just use the gate?”\nIn reponse, Duke Bevman replied,\n“It’s possible to use it to go in, but not to come out.”\n“What’s that supposed to mean?”\n“Inside Bamut prison, measures were taken to ensure that gates couldn’t open to the outside.”\nThese measures twere taken to prevent the prisoners from escaping, meaning that entry was possible but exit was not.\nUnable to look at Chun Yeowun, Duke Bevman spoke in a low voice.\n‘Phew.’\nHis daughter was trapped there because of the plan they had come up with, but now that he had taken the oath of allegiance, there was no way he could try anything. Chun Yeowun asked,\n“Then should we the forcefield?”\nDuke Bevman couldn’t hide his complicated feelings and exclaimed,\n“Y-yes!”\nBamut Underground Prison.\nIt was the only entrance and was blocked by the force field, which was why the he prison had lasted for so long and no one had ever escaped.\nHowever, that wasn’t the only thing scary about this place: the fact that the force field was at the entrance meant that a different force was acting from the inside.\nThe power at the source of this force field made the demons seem helpless.\nTatatak!\nSomeone was running through the dark dungeon: Marquis Irene.\n“Gasp…”\nBecause the gravity inside stronger than outside, it was too hard for Marquis Irene to run. She had no more energy left to use and the air inside Bamut made her weak and exhausted.\nWheik!\nShe could hear footsteps following her, which only made her more anxious; Marquis Irene’s goal wasn’t to talk with those following her.\nHer clothes were torn, almost looking like rags.\n“Damn it!”\nCurses sprang out of her mouth as she ran. This was the most terrifying situation a demon had probably ever been in, and in addition the place was so dark that she couldn’t even see anything.\nWoong!\nThe only thing that motivated her to run was her ability that wasn’t displaying anything, meaning that no one was around.\nAs long as she could use her ability to scout out her pursuants, she could maneuver away from their grasp.\nShe glanced behind as she continued to run.\n[284,000; 179,000; 234,000; 365,000; 220,000]\nShe was shocked at the outrageous numbers.\nEvery single number her ability analyzed seemed to show scarily increasing power levels. She didn’t know if this was because the prisoners were survivors here or prisoners for a long while, but she knew for sure that they were way too strong for her to handle.\n‘I can’t get caught.’\nIf she was caught, she would turn into their toy and die: she had to survive and get out of there.\nShe kept running with that thought in her mind guiding her.\nBang!\nSuddenly, the floor was crushed as something popped out and grabbed her ankle.\n“Uak!”\nShocked, she tried to use her power to remove its gasp, but instead of moving away, the thing that grabbed her instead lifted her up.\n“Ack!”\nCaught upside down now, Marquis Irene screamed out of pure terror. She couldn’t see very well because she was in the dark but she knew that it was a prisoner.\nAnd, of course, that she was upside down.\n“Huhuhu, a woman.”\nIt looked like the prisoner was licking his lips.\nMarquis Irene felt the goosebumps appear across her arms and along her body.\nChak!\nTerrified, she stretched out her hand and spewed out a spider web-like substance, but the prisoner holding her tore it down.\n[492,000]\nThis number filled her with the most fear she had ever felt, as this man was twice as strong as her. She wouldn’t be able to even put up a fight.\n“D-d-do you know who I am! I…”\nTear!\nHer top was ripped, revealing her bare body as she went silent out of fear.\n“Yes, yes, you are a woman.”\nThe savage in the dark drooled out of lust; here in the prison, she was no longer Marquis Irene but just a woman.\nThe savage, smelling her bare body, hummed with pleasure,\n“Hmm, nice fragrance.”\nWith that, she screamed in panic.\n“Kyaaak!”\nThen, in the dark space, a green flash-like beam shone and pierced the prisoner’s shoulder.\n“Kuak!”\nThud!\nLuckily, the Marquis was released and she fell to the floor. Pierced in shoulder, the savage prisoner seemed to be in pain as he looked back at the source of the light.\nWoong!\nIn the darkness, a green glow was emitted as a strong presence appeared.\nSeeing this, the prisoner was frightened and bowed to the newcomer, shouting,\n“K-King!”\nIt seemed that he was afraid of the being with the green eyes.\nA grotesque voice came from the green-eyed being,\n“Everyone in the underground belongs to the King.”",

      "content": "Chapter 202: Bamut Underground Prison (2)\n[Editor — Angel is wondering if she could put an Angel’s corner to express her thoughts after every chapter.]\n[Rynoh: I think I know someone in the higher ups…]\nThe Great Demonic Cult (????) is one of Murim's three most powerful factions, and it seeks only strength. It is on par with the Forces of Justice on the north and the Forces of Evil on the west. The Blade God Six Martial Clan uprising tipped Murim's three-way balance, resulting in a four-way deadlock.\nContent Warning: This chapter may contain scenes that may be harmful or traumatizing to some audience.\nA light was flowing through round marbles. Thanks to that, the darkness in the cave turned bright.\nMarquis Irene, who was walking through the long cave, bit her tongue and looked at the people guarding her.\n[930,000… 790,000]\nTheir power was too high for her to even try to tackle. Furthermore, these were just the minions.\nMarquis level wasn’t something that could go against them, so this was a disastrous situation for her.\nOriginally, their clan was tall and beautiful. However, even the man with a strong power had wounds all over his body, and the left side of his head was blown off.\nIt didn’t seem like his condition was good.\n‘He isn’t recovering?’\nDemons have regenerative powers, so they can’t have scars on their bodies.\nHowever, these two demons have many scars that make them look like humans wearing ragged clothes and not people of their clan.\nFrom green skin to green eyes, everything was appalling.\n“Stop staring, bitch. The King doesn’t like such things.”\nOne-armed demon with 790,000 power warned her. He was watching her every move. It wasn’t to escort her but because she had her chest out in the open.\n‘You stop staring too.’\nEven though she was a warrior, she was a woman. If someone continued to stare, she couldn’t help but feel uncomfortable.\nMarquis Irene asked the demon,\n“What about you? Why are you following me?”\nThey were calling someone\nNight King\n. As there were no guards, it meant that this was a lawless area.\nShe wondered who was the leader of these monsters.\n‘What is that person's ability?’\nShe wanted to know the strength, but strangely, she couldn’t read the numbers anymore. It was because of the ability she heard of.\nShe narrowed her eyes.\n‘The fact that there isn’t just one ability….’\nHere, Marquis Irene was sure of one thing. The person called\nNight King\npreyed on his people, and there is a high chance that he had many abilities.\nPredation was the only way to have multiple abilities.\nTak!\n“I told you to stop staring.”\nAs such, the demon with 790,000 power grabbed her wrist and warned her. However, contrary to the warning, his face was smiling as if he wanted to hold her.\n“Let go!”\nShe shook off the hand. It was unpleasant just to be touched by such people.\n“Where the hell are you taking me?”\nShe was convinced that there were no good intentions here because the one called Night King, who was walking ahead was treating her like a possession, grabbed her chest.\n“High grade.”\nThat was what he said.\nFrom her point of view, this was one trouble after another.\nThis felt like another threat. However, when he looked at the symbol of Grand Duke Kaliaf on her bottoms, he moved back.\n‘He’s familiar with the Grand Duke?’\nThat was the part that gave her hope.\nShe hoped that the Night King had a good relationship with the Grand Duke or was afraid of him.\nBut the worst thing was...\n‘What if they were enemies?’\nIf so, she would be torn apart.\nA demon with 790,000 power spoke with a smile.\n“You will soon be surprised.”\n“?”\nWhat did that mean?\nShe was thinking throughout the walk. As she was walking, her face turned thinner.\n‘It’s heavy.’\nGravity wasn’t constant, and it kept getting stronger inside the dungeon. It was tough to breathe.\nHowever, these prisoners who were beside her seemed fine.\n‘Are they used to this?’\nIn that case, their strength was understandable.\nGrowing up in this horrible environment for a long time, one would have no choice but to evolve according to it.\nWhisper!\nAnd then came the noise. There were a lot of whispers from the prisoners around, and eventually, she understood what was happening when they reached the end.\n‘Shit…’\nMarquis Irene couldn’t keep her mouth shut.\nAbout three hundred prisoners were sitting and talking. Never had she imagined that so many demons would be alive here. However, there was even more shocking than that.\n‘No way.’\nThe figure wasn’t leaving her eye. She looked at them one by one; each had the power of Marquis level.\n‘W-what is this place?’\nWheik!\nAs they looked at the\nNight King\nenter, the demons all rose and knelt with one knee.\n“Night King!!!”\nMarquis Irene trembled at that sight. Their voices didn’t matter. What terrified her was that so many monsters called him their\nKing\n.\nShh!\nAs if accustomed, the Night King raised his hand and then passed.\n“Woman!”\n“Look at her age! Must be delicious!”\n“\nGulp\n.”\nWhen they saw her half-naked, they were all interested. Marquis Irene was still having difficulty walking with her upper body out open for these savages to see.\n‘N-Not here. I need to run.’\nShe thought in her head, but she couldn’t do anything.\nThe one-eyed demon with 930,000 power held her so she couldn’t walk. Well, he was doing even more than that. He was dragging her.\nPak!\nHer toes would hit the stairs as the demons opened the path for them, going up to the highest point in the dungeon.\nShe looked at the ground, which had rags on it. Inside, the weird hut looked like a fortress.\n‘W… what are they?’\nWhen she saw two demons standing in front of the hut, she felt terrified, wondering if her eyes were mistaken.\n[5.83 million… 6.23 million?]\nHow could such strong ones be here?\nSurprisingly, they had fewer wounds than the other demons and were far more robust.\nPak!\nThey knelt with one knee in front of the Night King.\n“You have arrived!”\n“Night King!”\nThey got up and followed him inside after he raised his hand.\nShe was curious about this Night King who made sure that even those with Duke level power kneeled at him.\nIn the hut that she was dragged into, she saw the Night King sitting on a seat carved out of stone.\nHe had wrinkles that had the years of life as if he had been through a long time.\nWhat scared her was his green eyes. Amidst the silence, he then spoke.\n“What is your relationship with Grand Duke Kaliaf?”\nIt was a creepy and bizarre voice. She pondered how to respond wisely and finally said.\n“I serve him….”\nShe answered very cautiously and looked at him with tensed eyes.\n“I see. That grey hair… you must be Duke Bevman’s.”\n“How do you know that?”\nShe was shocked at the words of the man who knew her identity. If he could figure out her identity quickly, then he had someone close to Grand Duke Kaliaf, or he was close to him.\n“Who are—”\nPak!\n“Ack!”\nSomeone kicked her shoulder. It was the demon with 930,000 power.\n“Who told you to talk and ask questions as you please?”\nMarquis Irene, who didn’t receive this kind of treatment from Grand Duke’s side, shouted in rage.\n“You will regret this! I didn’t come here as a prisoner. There was an accident.”\n“Accident?”\nNight King was puzzled by it.\n“What do you mean?”\n“Grand Duke and pa… no, my father, Duke Bevman, will come to save me from this accident….”\nShe paused there. She wanted to threaten with some certainty, but their power was too strong.\nThen she continued.\n“If Grand Duke Kaliaf steps in, all of you could be in danger.”\nThe moment he heard that, the Night King laughed.\n“Kuahahahahaha!”\nHe was laughing in a strange voice that sounded like something was screeching. After he stopped laughing, he said with light shining from his green eyes.\n“Good.”\n“W-what do you mean?”\n“Well, I wanted to kill that bastard with my hands. Very good. This has to be Larisha’s blessing.”\n“Larisha?”\nShe didn’t know the old name of Arisha. Night King\nscreeched\n—-laughed at her.\n“This little one doesn’t even know that.”\nNight King motioned as if he was pulling her, and her body on the ground suddenly rose and moved to him.\nShe tried to kick and defend herself.\nPak!\nHowever, Night King was quick to grab her ankle. Holding her by the ankle, he tore off the clothes left on her.\n“\nKuaaak!\n”\nHer clothes were torn in the same way before, but now she was completely naked.\nShe wasn't used to close combat; therefore, her physique wasn't as muscular as the others'.\n“Your body looks great.”\n“Let go! You must really want to die!”\nShe shouted at him with rage. She never dreamed about such a humiliation.\n“If the Grand Duke and papa know about this, they will turn you to ashes…\nkuak\n!”\nHe twirled her and grabbed her by the wrist.\n“Right. It would be great if Kaliaf cares enough to come and save you, then I should treat you with the most sincerity.”\n“Sincerity?”\n“Let’s make you feel pleasure like never before.”\nThe Night King lowered his pants, and she screamed as she looked at the\nmonstrous thing\nbetween his legs.\n“D-Don’t do this!!”\n“Kaliaf and Bevman will be pleased…. seeing you turn into a woman.”\n‘!!!’\nShe looked terrified at it. Looking at her like that, Night King smiled and grabbed her by the waist, pulling her closer to him.\nHer eyes widened, and she screamed in shock.\nThe demons in the hut were only watching them with fascination in their eyes.\nIt was then…\nGrrrr!\nSuddenly, the hut shook. To be precise, the floor shook; the whole place shook.\nThe subordinates didn’t even understand what was happening.\n“What is this?”\nKwang!\nAnd then a loud roar was heard from outside. The demons under the hurt were looking at each other.\n“The fun needs to be pushed back.”\nPak!\nNight King pushed her away and tossed her aside before going out. When he went out, the demons surrounded someone in a circle in the square below.\nIt looked like he had different clothes on. The man who landed was wearing a black suit, and he had a fair face. It was no other than Chun Yeowun.\n“Who the hell is he?”\nThe demons mumbled at the sudden appearance of Chun Yeowun.\nNo matter how much they looked, they didn’t understand who this different being was.\nShh!\nAnd then another one fell from above. The one who fell was wearing a red cloak and a golden crown. It was Grand Duke Kaliaf.\nLooking at the hole in the ceiling, the Grand Duke spoke as if it was absurd.\n“Is this how the path is made? Master?”\n“Then, were you planning to wander through the caves?”\n“Uh.”\nChun Yeowun casually answered. The demons couldn’t hide their shock at the conversation.\nThe vibration they felt just now was because this man had come down?\n“What?”\n“A hole in the cave?”\nThe dungeon of Bamut is known to be strong and sturdy. It was so strong that no one could burrow and escape.\nShh! Tak!\nThen someone else fell in. It was a man with white hair and armor, Duke Bevman.\n“\nKuak\n!”\nDuke Bevman bent his knee due to the sudden change of gravity. He couldn’t adapt to the sudden change inside.\nFollowing Chun Yeowun and Grand Duke Kaliaf, he landed only to be shocked looking at the demons around.\n“This?”\nA cry echoed through the place.\n“Papa!”\nHearing the voice, Duke Bevman automatically looked at the top. A naked woman was crawling on the floor; it was Marquis Irene.\n“Irene.”\nSeeing Duke Bevman come here, the Night King’s cheeks shook in excitement.\nHis green eyes looked at Grand Duke Kaliaf.\n“You plunged to your hell, Kaliaf!”",

      "content": "Chapter 203: Bamut Underground Prison (3)\n“Kaliaf!”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf looked up at the bizarre voice calling him from the top.\nGreen eyes and green skin stood out from the monster, who wore a rag-like black coat.\nWith a puzzled expression at the unfamiliar sight, Grand Duke Kaliaf asked,\n“You know the Grand Duke, prisoner?”\nThe expressions of the demons who heard the word ‘prisoner’ instantly showed their anger, as they hated being treated like prisoners who were confined in this hell.\n“You!”\n“Prisoner?”\nUsually, demons were frightened by the Grand Duke’s presence, but their horrible days at the prison only filled them with hostility.\nEven Night King was wearing a strange expression as he looked his palms.\n‘Does he not recognize me…?’\nThe Night King’s eyes were filled with disappointment.\n“I asked if you knew me, prisoner.”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf asked again.\nThe Night King grinned and said,\n“You hypocritical fake. Nothing has changed over the years.”\n“Hypocritical fake?”\nThe Grand Duke raised his eyebrows. He was seeing this prisoner for the first time but this prisoner had not insulted him. Duke Bevman was uneasy.\n“Your Highness, my daughter—”\n“I know.”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf had seen her right away, but judging from the current atmosphere, it seemed like they would have to deal with the prisoners before bringing back Marquis Irene.\nHowever, it felt strange.\n‘Is he leading the prisoners?’\nThe prisoners in Bamut weren’t friends, but they all stood still and surrounded the area, as if waiting for someone’s order.\nGrand Duke Kaliaf looked at the Night King and said,\n“I guess being imprisoned isn’t enough as you wish to be killed, prisoner.”\n“Killed? Hahaha! Killed!”\nThe Night King laughed in a bizarre way, pointing at the Grand Duke and shouting,\n“You think this is the same place as the outside you came from? You just entered into hell by opening the gates with your own hands.”\n“Kuahahaha!”\n“Kulkulkulkul.”\nThe demons laughed at those words, but then they heard someone’s voice.\n“For being prisoners, they sure make a lot of noise.”\nIt was the voice of Chun Yeowun.\nEven the Night King, who only cared about Grand Duke Kaliaf turned, he asked with a ghastly glow,\n“You’re a… human?”\nAt his words, the other demons mumbled. Even though they thought that something was off about him, they didn’t think he could be human.\n‘What?’\nNight King was puzzled.\nEven the environment outside the prison was difficult for a human to survive, but this human not only opened the path into Bamut but was able to speak without difficulty.\n‘Is this a bluff?’\nNight King thought Chun Yeowun was bluffing, it was difficult to hold on in Bamut.\nEven he suffered during his first several months in this place.\nHowever, something strange began to happen.\nPsss!\nDuke Bevman was shocked at the black smoke coming from his nose.\n“What is this?”\nHe knew that he wasn’t feeling well since he had landed in Bamut, but this strange feeling was only confirmed when he realized that he wasn’t able to move his body.\n“Bevman?\n“Your H… Highness, something is strange.”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf frowned.\nHe, too, had been protecting his body with demonic power since this environment was different. However, if even a Duke couldn’t stand the conditions, then this place surely was horrible to stay in.\nAmong the demons on the hill looking down at the newcomers, one with muscles smiled and spoke to the Night King,\n“He is enjoying the benefits of Bamut.”\nEven if he was a Duke, everyone in Bamut received the same treatment and suffered the same effects. A yellow lipped demon on the other side smiled as he said,\n“You will soon realize that this place is hell.”\nBamut was the worst place for demons.\nThe moment they realized its secret, they were sure to experience despair. The Night King raised his hand and commanded,\n“You may kill all but Kaliaf.”\n“Wahh!!!!”\nAs soon as the command fell, the demons rushed towards Chun Yeowun’s group at once.\nAround 300 or so scar-covered demons joined in the frenzy as Grand Duke Kaliaf grinned while looking at them.\n“So adorable.”\nThe Night King seemed to have increased the courage of the other demon prisoners with his orders; however, the Grand Duke was a warrior was familiar with fighting hordes of enemies.\nIn a voice full of excitement, he said to Chun Yeowun,\n“There is no need for Master to come forward. I will deal with this on my own.”\n“You Highness!”\nWhen Duke Bevman tried to step in, Grand Duke assured him that he would be fine.\n“You, get used to this place first.”\nThe Duke’s condition didn’t seem too good, so he couldn’t just put the Duke aside.\nThe Grand Duke decided that it would be better to clear a few demons before the fight became more serious, which would give Bevman time to recover.\nOtherwise, Marquis Irene would be in danger.\nPhat!\nGrand Duke Kaliaf stretched out his hand as the opposing demons rushed in.\nHe tried to manipulate space by changing it into its marbling form, which would allow him to deal with multiple demons at once. Seeing this, the Night King’s eyes shone as he smiled and said,\n“Stupid attempt.”\nWoong!\n‘Huh?’\nWhen the Grand Duke tried to use his ability, the manipulated space instantly went back to normal.\n‘How?’\nHe couldn’t understand it. No matter how much he tried to use his spatial manipulation ability, the space kept returning back to its original form.\nGrand Duke was bewildered; this was the first time he had ever experienced this.\n“Kuahaha!”\nThe demons next to the hut on the hill all laughed. They thought that the Grand Duke would be different from the other demons they had dealt with, but even he seemed to struggle like the rest.\nThe demon who had 6.23 million combat power groaned,\n“You didn’t adapt to Bamut either as expected. What could you do in a place where powers are completely changed no matter how strong you are?”\nThis was the secret of Bamut: the abilities that used demonic powers were nullified or reversed due to the opposing force inside the prison cell.\nFrom the Grand Duke to the rest of the demons, everyone was scared.\nThey had all adapted to this place over many years and survived by fighting amongst themselves.\n“Kuakukuk! You look ridiculous, Kaliaf.”\nThe Night King looked at him and laughed.\nHe had been waiting for this day to come and it finally did. Here, even the strongest demons outside the prison became weak and powerless.\n“You are all done for.”\nThe demons ran in like a swarm of bees trying sting Grand Duke Kaliaf to the bone. Savoring the scene, the Night King looked down. However:\n“When will this end?”\nChun Yeowun stepped ahead as he asked those words.\n“Master, wait a minute!”\nShh!\nIn the unexpected situation in which his ability didn’t work, Grand Duke Kaliaf tried to use Advanced Awakening by covering himself. However, the awakening could only happen when demonic power was condensed and exploded out instantaneously, and in a place where demonic power couldn’t be used, that would never happen.\n“…”\n“Enough. Just stay still.”\n“Hm.”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf was flustered, coughing in response and saying nothing.\n“Idiot. If Kaliaf couldn’t do anything, what can you do? Tsk tsk.”\nNight King clicked his tongue as he saw Chun Yeowun step up. He had planned to kill everyone but Kaliaf, but now this human was digging his grave with his own hands.\nIt was that moment:\nKwang!\nChun Yeowun, who had been walking, stepped ahead as the floor was ripped away except for the land around Grand Duke Kaliaf and Bevman and stone pillars came out.\nPapapak!\n“Kuak!”\n“Ack!”\nThe demons who were running at the front had their bodies slammed by the pillars and some were even pierced by them.\nSeeing this, the Night King and his men frowned.\n“No!”\n“How is he using his powers?”\nIn order to use abilities and demonic power, one had to adapt to the environment, but this human was just casually showing off his powers!\n“Damn it!”\n“Avoid the pillars and attack!”\nHowever, the demons here had more combat experience than those outside the prison and were evil to the core.\nAfter the first time, they managed to move without being hit the stone pillars.\n“I don’t know how you’re doing it, but your ability won’t damage us anymore!”\n“Die!”\nFive demons ran towards Chun Yeowun at the same time, but Chun Yeowun kept stepping forward.\nAbilities spewed out from the hands of the five demons who were ready to take down Chun Yeowun.\nIt was then:\nPuck! Puck! Puck!\n“Kuak!”\n“Ack!”\nInvisible swords with a black energy appeared in the air and pierced their cores. Before their attacks could even reach Chun Yeowun, they had turned to ash, leaving the other demons perplexed.\n“W-what?”\n“How did that happen?”\nStep!\nChun Yeowun kept walking forward, not paying attention as he headed towards the hill.\n“As expected of Master. Bevman!”\n“Yes, Your Highness!”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf and Duke Bevman followed behind Chun Yeowun, wondering why they couldn’t use their abilities when Chun Yeowun seemed to be fine.\n“What are you doing?! Kill them!”\nA one-armed subordinate shouted from the top of the hill.\nThankful that they had only witnessed the slaughter and hadn’t been at the front of the attack, rest of the demons hesitated to move.\n‘What is this?’\nDespite shouting from top, the demon was confused.\nThe human was just walking, yet the sense of intimidation made them cower.\n‘Are those idiots down there scared?’\nThey were supposed to be warriors who didn’t fear death, but seeing this, it seemed that they couldn’t step out in face of the overwhelming power.\n‘Why isn’t he affected by Bamut?’\nEven the Night King was confused. Among the prisoners imprisoned there, some of them came from Talisha’s clan, and even they turned powerless when they first came to Bamut.\n‘Tsk.’\nEither way, it didn’t matter that much.\nIf this continued, the morale of the demons would crumble so he had to do something.\nThe Night King looked at the two demons him who were stronger than the Dukes and had 5 and 6 million combat power.\n“You need to go.”\n“Yes, we’ll take care of it.”\n“I will destroy that human.”\nThe two demons moved down while looking at the demons scared of Chun Yeowun.\nLooking at their backs, the Night King knew he could rely on them as they were the strongest demons imprisoned in Bamut besides the Night King.\nThe one-armed demon spoke to Marquis Irene, who was lying on the ground helplessly.\n“Woman, this will be a glorious sight.”\n“W-what?”\n“Those two were the monsters who fought for the top spot before Night King came. As long as they are there, no one can win.”\nAt that, Marquis Irene soon burst into laughter as her haggard face formed a smile for the first time since coming to Bamut.\n“Haa!”\nThe one-armed demon, who was displeased initially, became annoyed at her reaction.\n“Have you gone crazy, woman?”\n“You are mistaken.”\n“What?”\n“None of you here made my left eye burst.”\n“Your left eye?”\nThe demon didn’t know about her ability and asked what she was talking about.\nIn response, she looked at two demons who were walking towards Chun Yeowun and said,\n“How long will those two last?”\nGrab!\n“Kuak!”\nThe one-eyed demon grabbed her by the hair.\n“The more I talk to you, the crazier you seem, bitch. How long will they last? Fine! Should we make a bet then? Since there’s nothing left of my left arm, I’ll bet my right arm—”\nSlash!\nThe clear sound of something being cut resounded in the area.\n‘!?’\nThe most unbelievable thing then happened.\nA black line appeared in the necks of the two demons who were walking down, the strongest after the Night King.\nTheir necks sleekly slid to the side and fell to the ground.\nThud! Roll!\nThe heads rolled to reveal their faces, which had clueless expressions as they were oblivious to what had happened to them.\nAll the demons at the bottom were shocked and couldn’t say a word; there was one demon in particular.\n“Th… that…”\nThe one-armed demon, who boldly said he would risk his remaining arm, couldn’t complete his sentence.",

      "content": "Chapter 204: Larisha (1)\nVoid RealmAfter a Chun Yeowun climbed to the realm beyond the Natural Realm, he reached theVoid Realm.According to the \"Myriad Thought Scripture 萬思經,\" one of the ancient books known as the Three Great Books of the Central Plains, together with the Xuanbo Zhenjing (?????), if one realizes the emptiness and residual meaning, one will shed the shell.The first step is also known as the realm of emptiness. The state of realizing the truth of the universe.The one who reaches this realm can use space swords and space moves, or you can simply eliminate specific spaces.1\nGrand Duke Kaliaf and Duke Bevman didn’t have the eyes that could tell them the number of the opponent’s power. However, one can predict the opponent’s level when one reaches their level.\n‘Strong.’\nThe first time they saw the subordinates of Night King, they seemed fine.\nThese prisoners were full of confidence, moving with force, and the extraordinary power oozing out of their bodies was above Duke level.\nSlash!\nFor Chun Yeowun, it was just one slash. As Chun Yeowun was walking ahead, he lightly drew his sword, and their throats were slashed without even being able to exercise their power.\n‘… I feel it each time, but he’s really a monster.’\nThat was what the two of them thought, then what about the Night King who lost his men? The expression of the man who had infinite trust in his men went stiff.\n‘One slash?’\nIf he hadn’t witnessed it with his own eyes, he would have never believed it.\nPak!\nSomething protruded from the chests of each demon who were cut down. They were the nuclei that moved into the hands of Chun Yeowun.\nAfter pulling it out, the heartbeat in the bodies of the demons got weaker.\n‘Nucleus?’\nNight King frowned.\nThe match was already done. He thought about that because this is one of the many secrets of the dungeon. Unlike the other parts of the prison, this was the place where no one could regenerate after getting injured.\nThat was why the demons were fighting a life and death battle here; it was so that they would be stronger than the demons on the outside.\n‘What is he doing?’\nFor that reason, the Night King couldn’t understand Chun Yeowun’s actions.\nWoong!\nAt that moment, gloomy energy rose from Chun Yeowun’s right wrist. The nuclei he held in both hands were wrapped inside a blue light. The light then seeped into Chun Yeowun, and the nuclei broke.\nPsss!\nChun Yeowun closed his eyes and trembled. The green eyes of Night King, who was carefully watching Chun Yeowun, fluttered more than before.\n‘Right now, he….’\nHe doubted his own eyes. Other demons didn’t even notice it, but he knew.\n“Ability absorption!”\nThe one-eyed demon standing next to him was puzzled by Night King's words. It was because he didn’t know what it truly meant.\nPhat!\nAt that moment, Night King moved ahead like the speed of lightning and went for Chun Yeowun. He tried to grab the neck of Chun Yeowun, who had been temporarily defenseless as he was absorbing the power of the nucleus.\n“Who said you could?!”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf stopped Night King at high speed and kicked him.\nPak!\nNight King lightly grabbed the Grand Duke’s leg aiming for him.\nTremble!\nAs Night King caught the kick, he felt his right hand tremble. His eyes lit up.\n‘He is a candidate for the Demon King title. Has he gotten used to the place already?’\nThe Grand Duke’s powerful kick was extraordinary.\nUntil recently, Grand Duke Kaliaf hadn’t adapted to the conditions here. But in just a short time, he managed to use great strength.\n“You still have a long way off.”\nWoong!\nA green light flashed from his right hand. Ominous energy emanated from the green light along with a weird stench.\nNight King threw it into a fist and launched ahead.\n‘This is bad.’\nGrand Duke Kaliaf, who judged that this energy was dangerous, tried to move away but then stopped.\nChun Yeowun was right behind him.\n‘Shit!’\nThe moment he would move, Chun Yeowun would get hit by this bizarre energy. The Grand Duke immediately changed his mind and concentrated on the demonic power in his body to withstand this attack.\nBang!\nAnd the first attack was on his abdomen.\nThe moment the green light touched the body, a scream erupted.\n“\nKuak\n!”\n“Stupid bastard. Fighting me to protect the one behind.”\nThe secret of the green light was terrible poison.\nNight King had the ability to deal with poison even before he was imprisoned. Once he entered Bamut, he used poison gas and extracted it around the prison to get stronger than before.\n— shhh!\n“\nKuak\n!”\nThe Grand Duke’s armor began to melt after it was hit, and the color of his abdomen turned black. Grand Duke Kaliaf didn’t back down despite the pain.\n“Still, in the name of the former Demon King candidate, you must be working hard to not move despite the poison in your stomach.”\nThe Night King praised him.\nFor a being who had already been through numerous fights, he confirmed his power.\nEven Duke-level demons go beyond trembling. Their bodies shake with just a single hit of his fist, and then they will melt away.\n‘What amazing power.’\nIt was acknowledged that the demonic power in Kaliaf made him known to be a monster.\n“What is making you protect him?”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf was close to being a\nking\n. However, it didn’t make sense to protect a simple human.\nTrembling, Grand Duke Kaliaf said,\n“He is… the Grand Duke’s… master.”\nAt that, the Night King shouted.\n“Master?\nHa\n! You mean that the Grand Duke Kaliaf has a human monster! Is it because he has Larisha’s sword?”\nNight King noticed the power of Chun Yeowun.\nHe was convinced that Chun Yeowun had Arisha’s sword from when he absorbed the nuclei.\nGrand Duke Kaliaf didn’t answer. It was already taking him a lot of strength to control the poison seeping in.\n“You are still the same.\nKuk.\nDo you not know me?”\nNight King asked.\nHowever, Grand Duke Kaliaf had no idea what the other was saying. Green wrinkled face and glowing green eyes. None of the people he knew were like this.\nDisappointed, Night King said,\n“Enough. I was going to kill you anyway. Just die now.”\nAs if he didn’t want to talk any further, Night King pulled out a fist full of poison.\nNight King’s fist quickly aimed at Grand Duke’s chest.\nIt was then…\nPang!\nJust as he was about to punch, his body bounced back more than 10 meters by some counter-repelling force.\nPapapak!\n“\nKuak\n!”\nNight King looked at the Grand Duke with bewildered eyes.\n‘Did he kick my fist?’\nHis fist still had poison on it, but he couldn’t understand what had happened.\nThe force which deflected him didn’t come from Grand Duke Kaliaf.\nChun Yeowun placed his hand on the Grand Duke’s back.\n“I see you got what I entrusted you to, Kaliaf.”\nThe Grand Duke tried to smile.\n“Of course…”\nChun Yeowun smiled bitterly.\nActually, he didn’t take long to absorb his new powers, but he wanted to watch how the Grand Duke would act. Whether or not he was suppressed by force, if his loyalty was true, or if it was only in the form of words.\nAnd he passed the test.\n“The poison… I’ll take it out.”\n“What?”\nWoong!\n“Uh?”\nChun Yeowun placed his hand on the back of the Grand Duke and breathed internal energy into the body.\nIt was entirely different from demonic power, but it would avoid affecting the body if he handled it as if he was lightly inducing it.\nPapak!\nChun Yeowun lightly patted the Grand Duke’s body, and the poison came out.\n“Ack!”\nThe smoke even came out of Grand Duke Kaliaf’s mouth.\n‘He released the poison?’\nGrand Duke Kaliaf frowned at the ability of Chun Yeowun.\nThis wasn’t some strong poison, but it was still his first time seeing someone detoxify the poison this way.\nChun Yeowun looked at Night King and said,\n“You must be the leader of this place.”\nHe could tell that just by looking at the attitudes of the other demons.\nNight King, who was glaring at Chun Yeowun with his gleaming green eyes, said,\n“What are you? How can a human have that kind of power, and why do you have Larisha’s Sword?”\n“Larisha’s Sword?”\nChun Yeowun’s eyes narrowed at the mention of Larisha. Even Grand Duke Kaliaf was the same.\nThe only people who knew of Arisha as Larisha were the current Demon King who disappeared and him.\n“Who are you?”\nAt the question of Kaliaf, the Night King laughed bizarrely.\n“Ahahahaha. You are interested now? So late. You should have immediately recognized me, the Duke, the moment you saw me and apologize for not performing your duties as the servant.”\n“Duke?”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf looked confused, and Night King slammed his hand to the floor.\nPak!\n“Everyone! Die!”\nAt that moment, a stench and poison began to seep from the floor. Chun Yeowun quickly waved his hand, and Kaliaf and Duke Bevman behind him were thrown off and flew back.\n“Huh!”\nAnd the green light began to shine out from the floor—the light, which was poisonous, filled around a 50-meter radius reaching the ceiling.\n“Master!”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf looked at the green pillars that were soaring high. If it had been a little later, they would have been engulfed; they escaped thanks to Chun Yeowun.\nNight King giggled.\n“Idiot. To sacrifice yourself to save those people….”\nGrab!\nSomeone grabbed his head from behind.\n“Don’t tell me you thought you could avoid me with this trick?”\nNight King’s green eyes trembled as he heard the voice from behind. In that brief moment of his attack, he didn’t think the human would appear behind him by avoiding the poison.\n“If you know Larisha, you must know a lot.”\nChun Yeowun gave strength into his hand, and the Night King said with a laugh.\n“You made a mistake. You put your hands on my body.”\nPaaak!\nAs soon as he said that, a green light erupted from the Night King’s head. It was poison.\nHe could use poison from his entire body and even make a poison beam from his eyes. In a cheerful voice, he spoke.\n“Too late. It’s already on your hand, and the poison must be on….”\nCrack!\n“Kuaaal!”\nNight King screamed as Chun Yeowun’s fingers dug into his skull. The pain was brief, but he was still giving out poison, so he couldn’t understand how Chun Yeowun could still do it.\n“Y-You! Have you lost it? The poison will melt your han….”\n“What do you expect me to do?”\n“What?”\nNight King couldn’t understand what was happening.\nHowever, looking at the current situation and the expressions of the demons, a rough idea formed.\n“No… way.”\n“N-Night King’s poison isn’t working.”\nThe green light wasn’t entering Chun Yeowun’s body but was dispersing around.\nPoison was also a kind of energy, and it would be of no use if the opponent had energy surpassing his.\n‘No. I was planning to have it as a trump card.’\nGrunt!\nNight King clenched his teeth and endured the pain. He then tried to raise his hand to cover his face.\nHowever….\nChak!\n“Kuak!”\nBefore he could raise his hand, it was swiftly cut off from the elbow.\n“T-this…”\nNight King was shocked at how he was stopped before even doing anything. Chun Yeowun spoke in a tired voice.\n“This is tiring.”\nThen he lightly swung the sword, and the other arm of Night King was cut off.\nChak!\n“Kuaaak!”\nNight King, who could no longer depend on his poison due to the pain of the arms being cut off, soon reduced the poison discharge.\nHe only looked at his fallen arms.\n‘H-he knows about Awakening?’\nThere was no other way to stop this man.\nChun Yeowun spoke in a voice full of ridicule.\n“Thinking you can change with this Advanced Awakening… Well, I wouldn’t let you do that.”\n‘!?’\nNight King was shocked as it felt like Chun Yeowun could read his thoughts.\n‘W-what is this man!?’\nNight King thought as he couldn’t understand the situation he had never experienced before.\nIt wasn’t a matter of whether or not he succeeded in Advanced Awakening, but this man behind him could rip him off each chance.\nChun Yeowun asked while holding his head in his hand.\n“What do you know about Larisha?”\nAt that, Night King’s expression distorted.\n“You think I will just say something to you because you ask me repeatedly!”\nThe Night King wasn’t afraid of death. From the moment he came here, he thought he could die any moment.\n“Kill me if you want to!”\nInstead, the demons under him were shocked at his expression.\nNo one expected the one they worshipped as King to be so helpless.\nWith a distressed expression on his face, Night King decided to risk his life.\n“World has to be round. Larisha. The one who couldn’t do anything for you….”\n“If this is what you are, then you must know.”\n“What?”\nIt was then.\nPaaang!\nA tremendous wind pressure raged from behind. Night King, who was held captive, was thrown to the floor and rolled down as he didn’t have arms to stop.\n“Kuak!”\nAs he could not balance, he barely managed to get himself up.\n‘!!!’\nAnd the moment he was up, his green eyes shook.\n“N… No way…”\nNight King wouldn’t help but be shocked at what he was seeing.\nThe incarnation of black flame appeared in front of him.\nThe image of the one he always dreamt of.\n“La… Larisha!”\nAngel’s Corner\nSince we’re almost reaching the end, I have a question for you.\nWhat’s with DOTDG that made you keep on reading?\nFor me, it’s because I’m editing this, so I need to. Lol. Actually, aside from that, I like how the secrets keep on unfolding in every chapter. Also, I’m excited for Chun Yeowun to go home and be with his family! I hope he’ll be able to go soon after dealing with the MS Group. I can’t wait!\nThat’s mine. So, what about you? ??\n?1? Nano Machine Namu Wiki",

      "content": "Chapter 205: Larisha (2)\nIn the hidden underground complex in the Devil King’s Castle:\nDuke Edhuy was looking at a glass tube. When he touched the tube with his hand, the light on an arrow sign shone and a voice rang out…\n[Decreasing the concentration of the regeneration interruption liquid.]\nWhen the voice ended, the liquid in the tube gradually faded.\nBubble!\nAs the liquid went down, a change occurred in the tube.\nOriginally, the person in the tube had no body parts except for his chest and head, but he suddenly took on the shape of a human.\nHis body was forming as muscles grew and tightened; it seemed that regeneration was occurring.\n‘I lowered the concentration by just 5% and the rate of recovery is this quick.’\nDuke Edhuy’s face darkened. Although he had already made up his mind, the regeneration speed terrified him nonetheless.\n‘Although nearly two thousand years have passed, he still looks like a monster.’\nIt wouldn’t be weird if normal clan members had turned to ash in that time. He thought if he were to stop Chun Yeowun as soon as possible, the only hope for him was the being inside the glass tube.\n“Ugh!”\nThe being in the glass, which had wires in it, shook.\n‘Too quick.’\nOnce the basic muscles took shape, the body began to move. It was only a matter of time until this being come to his senses.\n‘No, I need to finish this.’\nDuke Edhuy, who was about to proceed, suddenly changed his mind and hastily touched the tube.\n[Normalizing the concentration of regenerative interruption liquid.]\nWoong!\nWith a resonating sound, the upper entrance of the glass tube split in half and opened. Duke Edhuy slowly moved up to look down at the existence in the glass tube, which was fixed with wires around to restrict motion\nShh!\nDuke Edhuy touched the armor on the man’s lower body.\nChachachacha!\nThe lower body armor disassembled and transformed into 12 daggers that floated in the air as if they were on defense.\nShhh!\nAmong the daggers, the one with the most splendid form had the shape of a crown and was on Duke Edhuy’s head.\n“Phew.”\nDuke Edhuy stretched out his hand towards the inside of the tube and the rest of the daggers entered it.\nThud!\nThe daggers which went in seemed like they were swimming and soon began to pierce each part in the tube.\nPuck!\nThey pierced the back of the man’s head, middle of his spine, his shoulders, both of his elbows, and his knees and ankles.\nThe handles seemed stuck, as if all 11 daggers were restraining him.\n‘Done.’\nDuke Edhuy sighed in relief; he was worried about whether the daggers would work.\nTremble!\nEven though the daggers were used to restrain the man’s movement, the glass tube shook. Even with just half of his muscles formed, the strength wasn’t even close to the man’s actual strength but he was still strong.\n“Are you rebelling?”\nDuke Edhuy put his hand on the crown on his head as a white light flowed from the daggers on the body of the being. Suddenly, the creature stopped moving.\n‘Done!’\nDuke Edhuy was joyous. Approaching the being carefully, he smiled that he had managed to control it as he mumbled.\n“Does it hurt, Demon King?”\nShocking words came from his mouth. The identity of the being inside the weird liquid with just half of its face was none other than the Demon King who hadn’t appeared in public for 2 thousand years.\nChak!\nDuke Edhuy came down from the tube and looked at the demon King who was restrained by the daggers and said,\n“You will finally be able to move according to the Duke who served you. Hahah!”\nThe lower body armor that had transformed into 12 daggers was known as Arisha’s dagger, and its ability was Control.\nIt perfectly restrained the opponent and allowed the user to control them.\n“Hahahaha! Demon King! To be able to move the Demon King at will.”\nDuke Edhuy couldn’t hide his joy at it. As long as he was able to control the strongest demon in the clan, everyone else would be useless…\nWith the Demon King at his command, everything was possible. If the Demon King appeared publicly, not just Grand Duke Kaliaf but all the demons would no longer object to his command; it was the moment he dreamed of the most when thinking of a new future.\n[The regeneration of the constraint is rapidly improving.]\nThe expression of Duke Edhuy, who was delighted, soon went stiff. Something expected was happening right in front of him.\nThe Demon King’s body, which was once again filled in liquid, suddenly started to regenerate.\nTatak!\nDuke Edhuy touched something on the tube and tried to increase the regeneration interruption, but the speed didn’t stop.\n‘J-just what the hell…’\nThis was the moment when he stopped understanding what was happening. The dagger in the arm of the Demon King, who had been fixed with wires, began to move.\nDuke Edhuy concentrated his energy onto the crown.\n‘Stop! Stop!’\nA strong white light shone from the dagger but the Demon King’s arm continued to twitch.\nBreak!\nThe wire holding the arm broke and:\nTear!\nThrough the glass tube, the arm of the Demon King grabbed the neck of Duke Edhuy, who was standing in front of him.\nGrab!\n“Kuak!”\nDuke Edhuy was the strongest of the aides, but the Demon King’s hand moved so fast that even he couldn’t react.\n“D-Damn it!”\nDuke Edhuy raised his demonic power and tried to cut off the Demon King’s arm, but a scream then erupted from the Duke.\n“Kuaaaak!”\nDuke Edhuy screamed, feeling his face shrink.\nNo, it wasn’t just his face. His entire body began to turn thin as if the moisture in the body was being drained out and his body kept turning smaller.\nPsssh!\n“Ack…”\nAt some point, Duke Edhuy wasn’t able to speak any longer. All that was left was the pieces of armor that he had been wearing, but they too scattered into ashes once his core was shattered.\nCrack!\nThe wires that covered the Demon King’s face and chest were cut revealing silver blue hair and a cold face.\nThe Demon King ripped off the wires on the rest of his body and broke out of the glass. However, the eyes of the Demon King were strange, as if filled with anger.\nTremble!\nHis body then emitted a tremendous amount of demonic power.\nPang!\nThe unimaginable power was strong enough to crush everything around him as it continued to grow.\nCrack! Thud! Break!\nThe Demon King’s castle collapsed in an instant due to the aftermath of his powers. The demons guarding the castle were startled and ran out.\n“W-what’s happening?”\n“What is this?”\nThe huge castle had collapsed in an instant. No, to be more precise, it had suddenly crumbled to the ground without a reason.\n“L-Look over there!”\nThe demons who managed to survive this looked at the center, where a huge crater had formed.\n‘!!!’\nThe demons discovered the existence in the middle of the crater and were all shocked.\n“H… he’s!”\n“His Majesty!”\nThe existence was the Demon King who had disappeared for so long. However, their surprise from seeing him didn’t last very long.\nThis was because they felt the huge, encroaching demonic power rising from him and, out of anger, the Demon King screamed,\n“LARISHAAAAA!”\nHe looked like the darkness that burned like a flame. All the demons there were shocked at Chun Yeowun’s appearance.\nThe motion of raising his hand to transform was unmistakable.\n‘A h-human Awakened?’\n‘Is he from our clan?’\nIt was natural that they were confused, but this wasn’t the reason the Night King was surprised.\nHis surprise came from Chun Yeowun’s Awakened appearance.\n“Larisha!”\nChun Yeowun was certain about his guesses once he heard the Night King’s exclamation.\n‘I guess he knew.’\nHe showed his Awakened form and doubted that the Night King knew of Larisha until Arisha’s old name that Kaliaf had spoken of came out.\nNight King who called him, hurriedly ran in front and knelt down while bowing his head.\n“Larisha!”\nHe was sobbing with a voice filled with an emotion that couldn’t be understood.The Night King continued to speak,\n“I, Joseph, always believed that Larisha would be fine!”\n“Joseph?!”\nHearing the name, the Grand Duke Kaliaf was surprised. There was no way he couldn’t know this name.\n“Someone you know, Your Highness?”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf nodded his head at Duke Bevman’s question.\n“I know him.”\n‘Arisha’s closest confidant.’\nHe was one of the two dukes who had supported the former Demon King, Arisha. He knew that when Arisha disappeared, he had disappeared too, but didn’t think that he would be in Bamut.\n‘Why is he in here?’\nHe was curious about it.\nShh!\nChun Yeowun covered his face with his palm.\nTurning back to normal, Chun Yeowun looked at the Night King who was still full of emotion.\n‘Hm.’\nChun Yeowun looked down and smiled.\n“Do you know me?”\n‘!?’\nAt those words, Grand Duke Kaliaf turned pale.\nHe thought that Chun Yeowun was going to say that he wasn’t Larisha, but that didn’t happen. Instead, the Night King raised his face in shock.\n“L-Larisha! Do you not know me?”\n“I don’t remember.”\n“D-don’t remember?”\nThe Night King was visibly confused at the answer, and looked at Chung Yeowun with a blank expression. After a moment, he seemed fine.\n“Ah, now I know why Larisha didn’t return.”\nThe Night King was convinced that Chun Yeowun was Larisha but had just lost his memory.\nOut of pure luck, he had entirely misunderstood the situation. At that, Grand Duke Kaliaf bit his lip.\n‘Ha!’\nHe didn’t think that Chun Yeowun would deceive the Night King—no, Duke Joseph—this way. He thought that Chun Yeowun would try to suppress the former Duke by force, but this was better.\nWhisper!\nDue to the rapidly changing situation, the demons around noticed something was off, prompting Duke Joseph to tell the demons,\n“What are you doing! Larisha—no, Arisha—has come! Bow!”\n“Arisha?”\n“He is Arisha?”\nAt his shout, the demons were shocked. Arisha was a legend in their clan.\n‘Is this true?’\nThe demons hesitated despite Duke Joseph’s orders, but it didn’t last long.\nThe demons who noticed the difference in power bowed to Chun Yeowun. Regardless of his being Arisha or not, their leader bowed so they too had to bow.\n‘Damn it!’\nThere was someone looking at the situation with displeased eyes.\nThat was the demon who was holding the head of Marquis Irene, who said with a sneer…\n“Forget about your other arm.”\nFlustered, the demon unclasped the hand on her head and said,\n“I-I didn’t say that yet!”\nHe was an unbelievable coward.\nInside the hut in Bamut. Chun Yeowun was sitting in a chair as Duke Joseph was kneeling.\nCuriously, Duke Joseph asked,\n“You really don’t remember anything, Your Majesty?”\nAt that, Chun Yeowun nodded his head without changing his expression. Duke Joseph, who believed that, grunted his teeth.\n“It all happened because of that bastard Taura who coveted the throne! If I had noticed his ambition a little sooner, Your Majesty wouldn’t have gone to the trivial planet known as Earth.”\n“Taura?”\n“Earth?”\nChun Yeowun and Kaliaf had a questioning look on their faces, and both had their own doubts.\nThe reason Kaliaf was interested in Taura was because that was the name of the current Demon King.",

      "content": "Chapter 206: Larisha (3)\n[Editor — Angel is excited for more upcoming revelations. ]\nThe Grand Duke asked with a puzzled face.\n“Demon King… no, ‘\nthis is because of Taura.’\nWhat does that mean?”\nHearing the Grand Duke’s question, Duke Joseph looked at him. It seemed like he still disliked Kaliaf.\n“Kaliaf, I have nothing to say to you.”\nHowever, unlike before, he seemed fine with his presence.\nGrand Duke Kaliaf shook his head.\n“Duke Joseph. Even if I said I didn’t know you, it is a little too much if you consider our friendship in the past.”\nUpon hearing that, Duke Joseph answered in an angry voice.\n“Even if Larisha is now like this, do you believe I will speak to someone who acknowledged Taura as the King?”\n“\nSigh.\n”\nThe Grand Duke sighed.\nIt was then that he realized why Duke Joseph hated him. Duke Joseph was a loyal follower of the former Demon King.\n“… we were at war at that time.”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf tried to explain his stand, but Duke Joseph raised his voice.\n“Then, after the war, why wasn’t Taura punished for breaking the law?!”\n“Duke Joseph… listen to what I have to say.”\n“I don’t want to hear it!”\nIn the end, even Kaliaf couldn’t stand it and also replied in a loud voice.\n“Then, as you said, without recovering from the effects of the third war, should we have waged an internal war with the man who took the place of the Demon King?!”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf yelled out his reason. The internal war couldn’t be waged unless the clan was safe.\nHowever, Duke Joseph had a different idea.\n“Justification. Reason… in this manner, when can you even catch that rebel traitor if you keep looking for such justifications….”\n“Enough.”\nChun Yeowun, who had been silent, intervened.\nDuke Joseph kept his mouth shut at the daunting voice. Then Chun Yeowun commanded him.\n“Tell me in detail about everything you know.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Larisha… no, tell me how I disappeared.”\nChun Yeowun wondered why Larisha had to go to Earth.\nDuke Joseph began to recall it.\n“I don’t remember exactly how many years had passed since I spent a lot of my time here. However, I do remember that it was during the 3rd war.”\nTwo clans were fighting for power on this planet: the Arisha and Talisha. They had led their clans to war for many years.\n“Unlike the 1st and 2nd wars, it was a time when everyone was getting tired as the war lasted long. And Larisha told me...”\n“About?”\nDuke Joseph spoke with trembling eyes.\n“He told me that it was pointless to wage war on this wasteland and said it would be better to find fertile land elsewhere.”\nThe Grand Duke nodded his head.\nIt was known that they went through a long 1st and 2nd war for thousands of years—turning the sky red and the planet dry. The shining civilization no longer existed.\n‘That is so like Larisha.’\nGrand Duke Kaliaf, who accompanied him, couldn’t hide the bitterness. He was indeed the best King he ever served.\n“So?”\n“Even during the war, Larisha would use the Gate from time to time and inspect other planets.”\n“… so it was decided to move.”\nDuke Joseph nodded his head at those words, and Grand Duke Kaliaf was puzzled by this unknown fact.\n‘Why?’\nHe was the one who never heard Larisha mention it. As if noticing it, Duke Joseph said…\n“It was a situation where the front line commander would be summoned after the plan had been finalized.”\n“Then who else knew?”\n“…who do you think?”\nAt that time, there were five Grand Dukes. Among them, Kaliaf and Taura were thought to be the next kings.\n“Taura…”\n“Larisha was looking for a suitable planet with our two Dukes and Taura…”\n“And that was Earth?”\n“You are correct. The creatures living on the planet had low strength, and there are few things that could be dangerous to us.”\nFrom the viewpoint of the demon, the Earth was weak. Even if a lower-level demon came, they could wipe many of them.\nAlthough he agreed to it, Chun Yeowun’s expression changed as humans were being mentioned this badly.\nDuke Joseph was unaware of this and continued telling the story.\n“Until then, that Taura bastard was also positive about moving to another planet.”\n“What was the problem?”\nThere must have been some reason.\nDuke Joseph grunted his teeth in anger.\n“I didn’t realize at that time that he might be greedy for the throne.”\n“Greed…”\n“Please punish me for my incompetence.”\nDuke Joseph banged his head on the floor as he sincerely asked for punishment.\nDismissing it, Chun Yeowun commanded him.\n“Continue.”\n“… specifically, around the time the migration was readied, Taura suddenly took a stance against it.”\nThe two Dukes at that time couldn’t understand the reason for it. As a result, the planned and prepared migration was halted.\nSince it was in the middle of a long war, Larisha also didn’t want to lose power, so Taura wasn’t opposed.\n“Why did Taura reject it?”\n“It must be because he was greedy for the throne.”\nDuke Joseph was sure that it was because of ambition. At that, Chun Yeowun spoke in disappointment.\n“So you don’t know.”\n“Uh?”\n“You don’t know the reason why he was against it.”\n“That…”\nAt that, Joseph shut his mouth.\nAs Chun Yeowun stated, he didn’t know the exact reason. There was only one reason he could guess.\n“Speak.”\n“… during a discussion, Taura rejected it at one point.”\n“And?”\n“Larisha frequently visited Earth to check it, and one day at a meeting, we were briefed about cooperating with humans.”\n“Cooperating with humans...”\n“Yes.”\nFrom what he heard, they were supposedly migrating to Earth and colonizing it. However, cooperation was unexpected for Chun Yeowun.\n“Larisha often said that humans on Earth are savage but rapidly developing, so working with them will help the clan. However, most of the demon's attitudes shifted after that.”\n“What about it?”\n“…\n‘what kind of cooperation would we need with livestock?’\nwas what Taura said.”\nChun Yeowun’s eyes narrowed at those words. The current Demon King, Taura, treated humans as livestock.\nFrom the perspective of humanity, it is incredibly unpleasant.\n‘But why did Larisha insist on cooperating with humans?’\nThis was strange too. Larisha was in the same position as other demons. Whatever happened, something changed Larisha’s intentions.\n“So, he started the rebellion because of that?”\n“Probably.”\n“Probably?”\n“It didn't take long for him to move.”\nThe migration to Earth was postponed, but the war was still happening. Small and large-scale wars were being fought each time, and Larisha, the Grand Dukes, and the Dukes would step in depending on the situation.\nDuke Joseph suddenly spoke to Kaliaf.\n“Duke Kaliaf… do you remember that day?”\n“That day?”\n“The day Talisha came to attack from the north.”\n“… that day.”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf’s face turned heavy. Chun Yeowun asked.\n“What do you mean?”\n“In the 3rd war, five wars were happening in different locations when Talisha suddenly came from the north.”\nThe head of the clan is needed to be in the battle. However, it was rare for Larisha or Talisha to bump heads directly since if the leader falls, so does the clan.\n“When the northern front collapsed, we received a message saying that Talisha had stepped up, and Larisha and the two Dukes went there.”\nIt was a clash of the leaders of the clans. It was a battle that could determine the victory at once.\nThanks to that, more than 40% of the clan’s power was sent there.\n“Did you win?”\n“Larisha and Talisha fought for three days and nights.”\nThat was a long time. Hearing this, Talisha seemed like a strange one too.\n“And the result?”\n“Larisha induced a strong wound on the other.”\n“Nice.”\n“But… Larisha had consumed too much of the power and suffered serious injuries, so Larisha had to return to the castle from the front line.”\nChun Yeowun thought.\n‘Both sides gained nothing but injuries.’\nRather than winning, they were both injured.\nPerhaps the other side was also happy that Larisha was injured. That would help boost their clan’s morale.\n“Our clan couldn’t miss the chance where Talisha was wounded, so we led the army and marched north.”\n“And Larisha was sent to the castle?”\nThud!\nDuke Joseph banged his head again.\n“It was disloyalty of mine! No matter how many people were there, I should have stayed back with Larisha.”\nIn the end, that was what happened. And Chun Yeowun asked Grand Duke Kaliaf.\n“What were you doing then?”\n“… blocking the southwest front.”\nTalisha was able to cross the northern front because of the sudden attack. As the large army suddenly rushed south, the Grand Dukes went there.\n“I see.”\nHe could guess what had happened. In the end, the seriously injured Larisha was left in the castle.\n“Taura targeted Larisha that time.”\n“Yes. Neither Kaliaf nor I could see that man in charge of the eastern front.”\nDuke Joseph banged his head in guilt. He truly regretted it. If he had stayed back, maybe the situation would have been different.\nShh!\nChun Yeowun stopped him from hitting his head with internal energy.\nHe understood the situation, but he couldn't punish him since he wasn’t Larisha.\n“The story isn’t done yet.”\nBlock smoke came from the forehead of Duke Joseph, and he continued.\n“When we came… came to the castle, it was all done.”\nThere was a message sent to the Dukes at the northern front. A statement that said Larisha acknowledged Taura was the Demon King.\nDuke Joseph couldn’t believe it and escaped from the front line and ran to the castle.\n“I didn’t believe him, so I questioned him.”\nThe current Demon King, Taura, insisted it happened according to law. But Duke Joseph couldn’t deal with Taura, who was now the Demon King and had Arisha’s Armor.\n“So what happened?”\n“I investigated the clan which remained in the castle that day to know the truth.”\n“It must have been dangerous.”\nIt was the Demon King’s castle, so Duke Joseph took the risk to uncover it.\n“Taura didn’t fully embody the power of the Demon King, so there were no other better chances than it.”\nDuke Joseph took advantage of it. After several days of investigation, he found an informant.\nThe person who was a member of the Demon King’s escort, and even though he wasn’t on duty that day, he happened to listen to the voice of the Demon King and Taura.\n“What was it?”\n“Taura said this.”\n[If the Earth is that good, then rot on Earth for the rest of your life.]\nThat was what the escort heard.\nAfter that, he said he witnessed the current Demon King coming out and slaughtering the others in the castle.\nLuckily he survived as he fled from the castle and hid in fear.\n“I asked him to testify, and I tried to bring down the current Demon King.”\nThe current Demon King broke the law and rebelled. To execute him, Duke Joseph contacted the high-ranking demons on the front lines and gathered forces.\nHowever.…\n“I took him too lightly.”\nNaturally, Taura’s aides were watching him.\nIt is said that Duke Joseph, who was caught before even contacting them, was imprisoned under the Demon King Castle.\n“He didn’t kill you.”\n“He was trying to convince me.”\nA war was going on, but the Demon King was replaced. As a result, the power was weakened.\nIn such a situation, Taura couldn’t hastily kill strong people.\nIf he were killed, the people who were Arisha’s aides would also resist, and new problems would arise.\n“While I was imprisoned, I tried to gain more demonic power.”\nUnlike the first, because of the war, his surveillance was neglected. Duke Joseph didn’t miss the chance and escaped.\n“After escaping. I hid to recover my body fully.”\nIt was indeed a coincidence.\nIt didn’t take long for him to recover. However, the third war was finished when he came out, and the clan was on the verge of stabilization.\n“In the meantime, Taura firmly established his position.”\nDuke Joseph couldn’t let it go. So he started to spread the word about what he knew to change the public opinion of the Demon King.\n“I thought that at least the loyal ones of Arisha would respond.”\nHe looked at Grand Duke Kaliaf as if asking why he didn’t respond.\nChun Yeowun knew one thing from this.\n“Kaliaf. The truth behind the rumors you spoke is here.”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf thought and said.\n“It was you. The one who made the rumor.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“I was doing inquiries to find someone who knew the truth.”\n“Inquiries?”\nDuke Joseph thought Kaliaf had bowed to the current Demon King.\nDuke Joseph couldn’t understand it. In the end, they were at odds with each other.\n“How can this….”\nIf only they had met, the present situation would have been different.\nConsidering the power of the Demon King, it was a low chance now.\nThen Chun Yeowun asked Duke Joseph.\n“You were captured by Taura and imprisoned here?”\n“… No.”\n“No?”\n“I thought the only place I could hide was Bamut.”\nBamut is known to be the worst prison. Who would think of running here?\nDuke Joseph decided that the pursuit would stop then, so he came here.\n“I wanted to survive… by gathering strength of the prisoners, somehow punishing those who rebelled against my Larisha!”\nWith a feeling of holding onto something, he chose the lesser evil. When caught, the result would be death either way.\n“Duke Joseph…”\nKaliaf felt deeply moved by his loyalty. He never dreamed someone sacrificed their lives so much for Larisha.\nKaliaf felt pathetic for the way he moved till now.\n“You are the true loyalist of Larisha.”\nDuke Joseph said in a voice that said that the sincerity was understood.\n“… I did doubt the Grand Duke’s loyalty.”\nThe hostility disappeared, and so did the misunderstandings. Duke Joseph looked at Chun Yeowun and said,\n“Still, seeing Larisha like this, all this is a penance for….”\nWhisper!\nA commotion could be heard from outside. Not long after, the one-eyed demon under Duke Joseph brought someone in.\n“Marquis Aruso?”\nIt was a demon under Grand Duke Kaliaf.\nUnable to adapt to the conditions here, he struggled to move.\n“What is it?”\n“Y-your… Highness, we have a problem.”\n“Problem?”\nThe fact that he, who was guarding outside, had to come into the prison meant something terrible had happened.\nThen Marquis Aruso answered.\n“The long-disappearing Demon King has reappeared.”\n“What?”\nGrand Duke couldn’t hide his shock. He was sure that the Demon King suffered a loss of life, but for him to suddenly appear in public after two thousand years.\nBut that wasn’t the problem.\n“Right now… he is heading towards the Gate.”\n“Gate?”\nThe Grand Duke was puzzled. He disappeared till now and suddenly heads to the Gate?\nHe couldn’t understand the reason behind it.\n“Why?”\n“I-it is strange. According to the informant. The Demon King said he would head to Earth right away.”\nChun Yeowun got up from his seat.\n“What did you just say?”\n“H-head to Earth…”\nHead to….\nIt’s probably neat to destroy and conquer it.\n“Ha!”\nChun Yeowun’s eyes turned cold.",

      "content": "Chapter 207: Rise of the Demon King (1)\nSwoosh!\nAs many as two thousand demons were following a blue, silver-haired existence exuding a daunting force. He was the current Demon King, Taura.\nThe eyes of the demons, who were moving like an army, were full of fear as they headed to a battlefield.\n‘Why are we doing this?’\nThey were all silent but shared the same question. About 20 high-ranking demons were absorbed by the Demon King in the castle and had instantly died.\nThe Demon King proclaimed that he would conquer Earth, and those who didn’t agree died.\n‘Who is Larisha?’\nThe Demon King, who appeared after two thousand years, was full of anger about this ‘Larisha’ person; it seemed like a name they had heard of but they couldn’t quite figure it out.\nOne of the demons following the Demon King, Marquis Alchemir, asked a demon,\n“How is the response to the call for conscription?”\nThe demon answered by checking something he was holding.\n“Grand Duke Dordo, who is at the northern front, said he cannot take his eyes off Talisha’s clan so he politely refused.”\n“And Grand Duke Kaliaf and Everdan?”\n“Grand Duke Everdan began his march to the nearest Gate, but there was no response from Grand Duke Kaliaf’s side.”\n“Huh. To be expected.”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf was the one who confronted the Demon King’s closest aides after he had disappeared.\nIt was impossible for him to participate now. In the end, only the Demon King and Grand Duke Everdan, one of the three Grand Dukes, was going to participate.\n‘Well, this should be enough.’\nMarquis Alchemir thought so. He didn’t know why the Demon King was so enraged, but they already had amassed a ridiculous amount of power in comparison to the humans.\n‘How long would this conquest take?’\nWith this power, they could conquer Earth in three days.\nThe only thing that worried him was Talisha’s clan. Although they had signed a non-aggression pact, they would still attack if the forces weakened.\n‘Leaving two Grand Dukes here might be the move.’\nMarquis Alchemir thought it was better, or at least safer, in the north and west. At the least he would be able to head down to Earth with some peace of mind.\n“All done.”\nThe troop then reached the southwest side of the Gate. In the castle, Grand Duke Everdan and a thousand demon soldiers were waiting.\n“Everdan greets His Majesty the Demon King.”\nHe fell to his knees, moved by the sight of the Demon King whom he hadn’t seen in long. The Demon King raised his hand coldly, not bothered by the Grand Duke’s actions.\n“Where are the officers and guards?”\nOriginally, other demons were in charge of the device of the gate but they weren’t to be seen.\n“When I arrived, the entire castle seemed empty.”\nAt Grand Duke Everdan’s words, the Demon King looked at Marquis Alchemir.\nPerplexed,\n“T-that…”\nNot just Marquis, but the other demons couldn’t answer it.\nIncredibly, what happened was that the night prior, Grand Duke Kaliaf had sent Duke Bevman to handle the Gate, and while Duke Edhuy was the only one who noticed it, he was killed by the Demon King when the Demon King woke up.\n“Doesn’t matter. Open the gate.”\nThe Demon King, who made up his mind, didn't care anything else.\n“Haa.”\nNervous, Marquis Alchemir breathed a sigh of relief. Fortunately, the large-scale Gate was able to be handled by the high-ranking demons.\nCount Ditto, an assistant to the Marquis, operated the Gate.\n“Highness Marquis, where on earth do you wish to move?”\nAt the question, he looked at the Demon King.\nHe couldn’t stop thinking of the Demon King’s recent rampage when he had mercilessly killed his own subordinates.\nMarquis Alchemir, who was afraid of making the Demon King feel uncomfortable, whispered.\n“Anywhere. I just need to head to Earth, so it doesn’t matter where”\n“Got it.”\nCount Ditto, who heard the Marquis’s response, placed the device down and saw that the most recent Gate connection was to Earth.\n‘There we go.’\nCount Ditto, who found it fortunate, opened the Gate to the same coordinates it was recently used.\nYongchun Group site.\nCoincidentally, the Jinan City National Guard was currently there.\nDue to the Gate that opened at the Yongchun site, the commander of the National guard had gathered an army there along with Chun Yu-jang was there.\n“Do you really expect me to believe this?”\nA middle-aged man with a mustache in uniform said. He was Cho Yun, the commander of the Jinan City Defense Force.\nHe should have been sitting at the headquarters but had decided to directly lead the army since nothing like this had ever happened before.\n“Calm down, Commander Cho.”\nChairman Chun Yu-jang said, trying to soothe him.\nRaising his hand towards the Yongchun site that still had traces of a fight, Cho Yun yelled,\n“How do you explain this? Are you going to say that I’m not seeing things right?”\nThey were traces of the battle with Blade Six.\n“Phew, this has nothing to do with the Gate. This is different—”\n“Chairman Yong Yu-cheon! Is this a company or is it some private institute planning something secretly?”\nYong Yu-cheon was Chun Yu-jang’s pseudonym, as he planned to use his real name once the merger was finished. However, due to the recent turn of events, he didn’t change it just yet.\n‘Look at him.’\nChun Yu-jang clicked his tongue. The Jinan Defense was dissatisfied with them because of their agreement with the National Defense. It was likely that the Gate was just used as an excuse to torment them.\n“If that’s the case, then why don’t you talk with the director of the Ministry of National Defense for more details?”\n“Ha!”\nAhn Woo-hong was the director of the Ministry and Commander Cho Yun was just a commander for Jinan city, so it would just result in his demotion if he did something wrong.\n“Trying to intimidate us by calling our superior…”\nThe atmosphere was harsh, but then something unexpected happened.\nGrrrr! Woong!\nA thunder-like roar as well as bright lightning came from the sky. Everyone began to look up.\nAt the Yongchun site, a new phenomenon occurred: a huge black hole began to form and one of the National Guards ran to inform his superior.\n“C-Commander! The gate is open!”\nEven if he didn’t inform the commander, everyone was able to tell nonetheless. Looking at the Gate’s opening, Chun Yu-jang was flustered.\n‘Is ancestor coming back?’\nThe timing was tricky, but unlike his shock, the presence from the Gate was unexpected.\nSwoosh!\nThousands of human-like figures in medieval armor appeared through the Gate.\n“Humans?”\nCho Yun’s face went stiff at the sight; the Gate had several Hazard-class Entities.\nAmong them, the strongest were the Special Entities who also were intellectually advanced.\n“Special… entity?”\nAt first glance, it seemed like thousands of people were flying in, but such beings couldn’t be human. Commander Cho Yun shouted.\n“Prepare for battle!”\n“The entire army is ready for battle!!!”\nAt his command, the officers shouted!\nWheeing! Clank!\nA mechanical device came down from the side of the 40 ZRV-30 tanks and surrounded the Yongchun site.\nThe 130mm caliber barrel went up and aimed for the Special Entity in the sky.\n“Ready to fire!”\nMore than 2,000 men from the military trucks were down and ready to shoot their machine guns. Because they had come prepared for battle, their response was quick.\n‘This is insane.’\n‘But why here?’\nChun Yu-jang and the other members of Yongchun were confused. They thought that Chun Yeowun was coming back, but Special Entities had arrived instead, and thanks to that, Yongchun was now a battle site.\nAt that moment, they saw someone coming down the gate.\nWoong!\nThe being was a beautiful existence with blue-silver hair, and when he appeared, the entities before bowed to him. Anyone could tell that he was the leader.\n“it must be the Alpha!”\nCommander Cho Yun was convinced that he was the Alpha, and no longer hesitated after figuring this out.\n“All troops proceed!”\n“Yes!!!”\nAs the order fell, the officers followed and shouted as the artillery and machine guns fired at the same time.\nBang! Bang! Bang!\nDudududud!\nThe sound of guns blaring filled the atmosphere.\nThe site of Yongchun Group was covered in guns and tanks that resounded as thousands of bullets rushed for the thousands of Special Entities floating above the Yongchun site.\n‘Win-win situation.’\nCommander Cho Yun thought that this situation would take out two birds with one stone, as it could be resolved at the Gate entrance in the city and, if a war broke out, they wouldn’t be held responsible for Yongchun’s destruction.\nBut something unbelievable happened.\n“C-Commander!”\n“Over there!”\nThe officers seemed shocked. The countless guns and shots fired weren’t hitting them, as if something was blocking them?\nPssss!\n“W-what the hell…”\nThe firepower, which could damage everything around, was stopped. If their bullets couldn’t reach their target, how could they do any damage?\nThere was one person responsible for blocking it.\n“Ohhh!”\n“As expected!”\nThe Special Entities, or demons, seemed shocked by it.\nThe blue, silver-haired Demon King had reached out his hand as a huge field surrounded them, neutralizing the firing.\n“Such tiny beings.”\nThe Demon King looked at the tanks that were firing, as they were more annoying than the humans shooting. The Demon King held out his index finger and said,\n“Disappear.”\nPhat!\nAt that moment, a white light shone from the finger and penetrated the tank that was still trying to bombard them with bullets.\nKwaang!\nThe tank, which was pierced, exploded, but that wasn’t the end.\nHe used the finger-ray on each tank one after another and continued in a line.\nKwang! Kwang!\nThe ray from the Demon King’s finger exploded the tanks. Bewildered, the soldiers in the tanks began to run out of them.\n“R-run away!”\n“Jump!”\nIn an instant, the situation had changed, and there was no way they could stop the Demon King.\nThe tanks that were hit with the beam exploded and, and 50 of the tanks had now been destroyed in just seconds.\n“W-what the hell is that?”\nCommander Cho Yun and the others were at a loss for words. He and the soldiers had dealt with numerous entities until now, but this was the first time that such a thing happened.\nIt was the same for Chun Yu-Jang and the other executives.\n“What is that monster?”\nIn the chairman’s office of Yongchun site, the demons who were looking at the sky through the window were shocked, including Shakena.\n“H-how did this happen?”\n“Shakena, are they part of your clan?”\nShakena nodded at Mun Ran-yeong’s questions. What made it weird was that the number of demons floating in the air was too much to count.\n“What is this? Why is the Lord not coming? Why are they ganging up like that?”\nHu Bong bit his lip, looking at the demons.\nEach of the demons had abilities overpowering most humans, and thousands of them appeared now. Even Hu Bong began to feel nervous.\n“We need to stop them.”\nBaekgi looking out the window said in a serious voice.\nThese demons couldn’t be stopped by the National Guards, especially that monster that wiped out the tanks with a light from his finger.\nMun Ran-yeong nodded, agreeing to comment and tried to move, but Shakena stopped.\n“W-wait! Sister!”\n“What is it?”\n“Enough.”\n“What?”\n“If we don’t surrender now, all the humans here will die.”\nAt Shakena’s words, Mun Ran-yeong asked confused about the situation.\n“What are you talking about?”\n“H-he isn’t someone that any of us can handle.”\nEveryone was puzzled at her frightened words. She was acting different from the usual Shakena they knew. Baekgi who noticed her strange behavior, asked,\n“Who is he?”\nIn a voice full of fear, Shakena responded.\n“The D-Demon King.”\n“Demon King?”\nEveryone was shocked at the title ‘Demon King’. If that was the case, then how would the captured demons feel?\nBaekgi looked at the demons who were bound.\n‘They are… afraid.’\nAll of them were in fear and horror. It was known how overwhelming the Demon King outside was.\nHu Bong spoke to Shakena, who was afraid.\n“What are you afraid of? We have\nthis\n.”\nBy\nthis\n, Hu Bong meant the Golden Gumiho, the absolute existence that no one but Chun Yeowun could stp.\nHowever, Hu Bong seemed puzzled by her actions.\n‘What is with her?’\nUnlike before, the Gumiho was looking out with a serious look, and her eyes were fearful and vigilant.\nHu Bong called her.\n“Miss Gumiho?”\nTo that, she answered in a trembling voice,\n“You all… should run away.”\n“Huh?”\nThe golden Gumiho turned her head to Hu Bong and said,\n“You might die here.”\nThe golden Gumiho was something that everyone in the world would fear. Unlike humans who couldn’t accurately guess others’ power levels, she could feel how monstrous the Demon King was.\nHe exuded an ominous energy that overturned everything.\n“Isn’t it too early to say that without even trying?”\nThe Gumiho snorted at Baekgi’s words.\n“You aren’t a match.”\nThe Demon King and the energy he exuded was so unbelievable that he could destroy the entire place with a single gesture.\nShe too was shocked at his power; she would be able to escape but the humans here wouldn’t be able to do so.\n‘What do I do?’\nThe Demon King was the biggest problem, but the silver-haired man was trouble too.\nJust looking at him, she was sure that no one could tackle them. The person she was thinking of was Grand Duke Everdan, who could be the Demon King’s successor.\n‘If these ones die… Chun Ma will be heartbroken.’\nEven in the fear, she was worried about Chun Yeowun. Grand Duke Everdan then looked at her.\n“It’s too late.”\nThe golden-haired Gumiho said with a voice of despair.\nDid the experts recognize one another?\nJust as she guessed and evaluated their strength, Grand Duke Everdan noticed the golden Gumiho.\n“Your Majesty.”\nAt Grand Duke Everdan’s call, the Demon King waved his hand as if he were annoyed, meaning that he would let the Grand Duke handle it himself.\n“Thank you.”\nGrand Duke Everdan smiled in joy and rush towards the Gumiho.\nPaaang!\nThe Golden Gumiho bit her lip and shouted,\n“Everyone run!”\nWith that, she threw herself out the window as her body was dyed in a golden light.\nWoong!\nWithin the golden light, she grew from her human form and changed into a giant Gumiho.",

      "content": "Chapter 208: Rise of the Demon King (2)\nDuke Joseph — one of Larisha’s closest aides and known as the Night King of Bamut. He went to hide and make himself stronger until he could oppose the current Demon King. He was one true loyal subordinate of Larisha, but he’s a f*cking jerk.\nWhisper!\nThe Yongchun Group’s site had fallen into chaos. The sound of massive shelling and firing in the area shocked all the cult members who fled their buildings.\nThey couldn’t help but feel that a catastrophe was impending when they saw thousands of demons floating above.\n‘W-what in the world…’\n‘H-How can this happen….’\nThey knew these couldn’t be comparable to the Gate beings they’d faced before by just glancing at the enemies’ capability to fly. It seemed as if they were watching the most skilled martial artists in the sky.\nChun Woo-jin, the Lord of the cult, was the one who brought them out of daze and confusion.\nSrnmg!\nHe pulled out his sword and shouted.\n“Members of the Sky Demon Order. Everyone, calm down! A Gate has opened right above our place. Are you just going to stand and watch?!”\nAs he advanced, executives such as Wang Shin, Dan Cho-jin, and the heads of the clans below them began to advance as well.\n“Prepare for battle!”\n“Prepare for battle!”\n“Yes!!!”\nThe ground turned into chaos at their battle cries. The power of the Sky Demon Order within the Yongchun site wasn’t less.\nCombining the power of the North Sea Ice clan and the clan that joined recently, they had close to 4,000 martial artists under them.\nTatata!\nThe bullets were still in the air.\nThe Demon King saw the members of the Sky Demon Order who were gathering down and gave orders to the commander next to him.\n“Sweep them away.”\n“Yes, Your Majesty!!!”\nThe leaders were ecstatic, and their morale rose as soon as they sensed the presence of an actual battlefield.\nEven though they were dragged here forcibly by the Demon King, they were all war-like beings, so they couldn’t contain their enthusiasm when a battle was about to happen.\n“Each legion, eradicate all the worms on the ground! Attack!”\n“Wahhhhh!!!!”\nPhat! Phat!\nLegions composed of low-level demons shouted and flew. The Sky Demon Order members couldn’t hide their anxiety as thousands of people descended.\n“Prepare for battle!”\nWoong!\nThe warriors below skillfully handled their swords and weapons in response to their leaders’ cries.\nIt was indeed a sight to see so many weapons having energy on them and shining in white and blue.\n“Kill them!”\n“Kill them all!”\nChachachachacha!\nAttacks made of sword energy and internal energy soared up.\n“Kahaha, see those worms fiercely rebelling against us!”\n“Respond!”\n“Use the sphere of demonic power!”\nSeeing that, the demons upped their forces and threw the sphere to the ground. This marked the beginning of ranged attacks.\nKwakwakwa!\nThousands of attacks clashed and collided in the air. Smokes were smeared in the space between the land and the demons in the air. The clash was terrifying enough, considering it was only the beginning of the battle.\nPapapak!\nThe demons made their way to the ground through the flames and smoke. Thousands of the Sky Demon Order members on both sides collided with the demons led by the Demon King.\nFrom the moment it turned into a close encounter, it was war.\nChachachang!\n‘What exactly are they?’\n‘So strong.’\nThe members of the Sky Demon Order who clashed with the demons couldn’t hide their shock. The strength of the enemies was beyond common sense.\nEven if they were low-level demons of Baron or Viscount, their power seemed to be on par with the Master and Super Master levels.\n“Kuak!”\n“Ack!”\nAs a result, the lower-level First Rate warriors couldn’t help but get hit by them. It wasn’t a matter of negligence, but the demons’ battle experience, strength, and talents were vastly superior.\nHowever, not everyone was swayed by it.\nShhhhh!\nThe demons froze whenever Dan Cho-jin spread his sword technique on the fierce battlefield. Taking advantage of that, the North Sea Ice clan broke the frozen demons down.\nCrack!\nThere was also Wang Shin, who was wielding his two swords, and Marayun, a ruthless warrior moving with his seven Air Swords.\nFurthermore, the famous warriors within the Sky Demon Order and the sub-clan leaders all demonstrated their valor.\nBut thanks to that, high-ranking demons were interested in them.\n“There seem to be some fine ones. Haha.”\n“I will deal with this human.”\nThe war became more intense as high-level Count level demons joined the battle and rushed to the clan leaders. The two sides were engaged in a fit of rage, and the situation was dire.\n‘Things aren’t turning out fine.’\nChun Yu-jang, who was leading them, was observing the entire situation. Not all the demons had yet taken part.\nThe Marquis and higher-level demons were watching from the skies with their arms crossed, unlike the leaders of the Sky Demon Order, who were doing their best here.\nIt felt like they were being hunted.\n‘I think the seniors under my ancestor should help.’\nBaekgi, Mun Ran-yeong, and Hu Bong.\nIt appears that the situation would worsen if they didn’t participate, but they couldn’t be found anywhere.\nWoong! Phat!\nA loud roar was heard from the side of the main building, and a golden ray of light broke through it.\nKwakwakwang!\n“Ugh!”\n“Avoid!”\nDue to the destructive power of the golden beam, everyone, regardless of demons or humans, avoided it. A great battle caught the eyes of those who had just moved.\n“Fox?”\nIn the vicinity of the Yongchun Group, a golden fox and a demon in armor were fighting.\nTheir battle was different from the one here.\n‘Damn it!’\nThe Golden Gumiho cursed. She gathered all the energy within her and spat out a beam at the bastard, but he simply bounced it off.\nThanks to that, she almost ended up hurting the cult members.\n“Ahahaha. This feels so nice. Great! I thought I would have to deal with humans, but this is so much fun.”\nOn the other hand, Grand Duke Everdan’s morale had risen. He didn’t feel interested in humans, but he enjoyed this battle against the Golden Gumiho.\n“Make me feel more enjoyed!”\nShe altered her plans in response to Grand Duke Everdan’s demeanor.\n‘Let’s fly higher.’\nIt appears that if the fight continued here, the members would get hurt. The Golden Gumiho, who thought of luring him, tried to fly.\nHowever…\nShhh!\n“I see what you are doing. Beast.”\nSuddenly, Grand Duke Everdan appeared above her, clasped his hand around her head, and slammed her.\nKwang!\nKikikiki!\nA scream of pain escaped from her mouth. Even in the middle of it, the Golden Gumiho was able to twist her body and sought to use her tail to weaken the impact.\nKuaaak!\nFortunately, she avoided destroying the main building. Grand Duke Everdan smiled bitterly as he saw her frantically trying not to harm those around her.\n“You seem worried about other things and aren’t fighting properly. Then, I will erase your worries.”\nShhh!\nGrand Duke Everdan raised his hand.\nWhite spheres made of demonic power rose around the building.\nWoong!\n‘No!’\nThe Golden Gumiho was frightened of what was about to happen. She quickly moved four of her tails to wrap around the building, but Grand Duke Everdan laughed.\n“You are slow, beast.”\nAnd when he clenched his fist, the spheres rushed to the building at once.\n—- Nooooo!\nIt was then…\nThe sphere moving towards the building suddenly changed its direction and flew up.\nPapapak!\n“Huh?”\nGrand Duke Everdan was perplexed by what had occurred. Even his body lost its balance and flew upward at that time.\nWheing!\n“What?”\nThe Golden Gumiho was also puzzled by what she saw.\nSomeone suddenly screamed.\n“Now!”\nThat was the cry of the Gravity Witch, Yu So-hwa. She unfolded the Gravity Field, reversing the field within the perimeter.\nThanks to that, Grand Duke Everdan couldn’t stop and flew around.\nWheik!\nHundreds of spheres of flame appeared all around.\n‘This?’\nThe Golden Gumiho glanced up on top of the building. Hu Bong and Mun Ran-yeong stood on the roof, their hands up, directing the flame qi spheres.\n“Bong-bong!”\n“I know!”\nThe two focused all their energy on Grand Duke Everdan, who was moving weirdly. Then the spheres rushed at once.\nSwoosh!\n“You people!”\nGrand Duke Everdan looked at the spheres approaching him while he was still moving weirdly because of the gravitational field and tried to deflect the attack. However, another unexpected support was there for the humans.\nWheing!\n“What?”\nThe terrifying wind came over and blew over him. The wind brought a vast amount of gale around.\n“Hurry up!”\nIt was Im So-Hye, the third secretary of Chun Yeowun.\nShe sought the help of Hu Bong and Mun Ran-yeong to test whether they could control the sphere in zero gravity. Of course, even without that, the flames could reach Grand Duke, but only with tremendous effort.\n“T-this!”\nKwakwakwang!\nThe moment the spheres of flame touched, a massive explosion occurred. If the gravitational field hadn’t made the Grand Duke float higher than the building, then the entire building would have been blown away.\nPapapang!\n“Haap!”\nBaekgi, who was ready and prepared on the roof, blocked the explosion’s aftermath that was coming in with an Invisible Kick. So the four could concentrate on the attacks.\nAt that, the Golden Gumiho smiled.\n— That is pretty fine.\nShe told them to run, but she was worried they didn’t and tried to protect the building. However, she didn’t think they could think of such an attack.\n—- Then, just to be sure.\nShe opened her mouth wide and concentrated the Yokai energy….\nGoooo!\nAnd shot out a golden beam of light to where the explosions occurred.\nPssss!\nGrand Duke Everdan bounced it off before, but he couldn’t avoid it since he was currently trapped.\nKwaaang!\nThe beam hit the right at the center of the explosion, and Hu Bong was delighted with it.\n“Yeah! She did it!”\nIt was a linking attack of those strongest here: the Golden Gumiho, the Divine Masters, and the SS-Class people. Who could avoid it?\nThud!\nYu So-hwa and Lim So-hye exhaustedly collapsed after doing their utmost to contain Grand Duke Everdan, who was able to retaliate against them with his strength.\n“M.. monster.”\n“I don’t think I can do anything now.”\nJust looking at the veins on their foreheads and nosebleeds, one could tell how hard it was. They did a great job tying up that one Grand Duke, which surpassed an S-class Alpha.\nThe Golden Gumiho praised them.\n—- You did well. Still, we managed to kill one of the annoying… shit!\nWhile talking, she suddenly looked up.\nGoooo!\nThe demonic power suddenly shook. The faces of Hu Bong and others went stiff. The sky turned silver.\n“T-this…!”\n“Everyone move!”\nEveryone shouted the same thing. At that moment, a huge silver light shone from the sky and struck the building. The flash of light had a force that wanted to destroy the building and everything around.\n—- Ahhh!\nThe nine tails of the Gumiho quickly wrapped around the whole building, including its roof. In that state, she opened her mouth and fired a golden beam at the silver flash.\nPssss!\nBoth rays of light collided. However, the gap between the two was entirely different. The golden one didn’t even last a few seconds and was overpowered by the silver light.\nKwaang!\nThe silver flash which covered the Gumiho also covered the building. A gust of wind broke out in all directions smashing down the other builds, and debris scattered up.\nPapapak!\n“Kuak!”\n“Ack!”\nThe demons and the other members who were in a fierce battle were injured at this and thrown back. It was so powerful that it caused damage all over the place.\n“W-what is this?”\nChun Yu-jang, who looked at the smoke around, was confused. Hundreds of people were hurt because of that flash that just happened.\nHowever, in a situation where the demons were all injured, they were shouting.\n“Wahhhh!”\n“Advanced Awakening!”\nAs seen by the demons, there was a monster in the sky above the site whose body was now silver with only two eyes visible. It was Grand Duke Everdan.\n— Damn things. How dare you target this Grand Duke!\nUnlike the demons who cheered, the Grand Duke, which pride had been wounded in the last attack, stared down in rage.\nHe had to resort to Advanced Awakening as he nearly lost his life because of the attacks.\n— Ha!\nHe let out an exasperated sound from his mouth.\n— Such a foolish beast. You sacrificed your body to stop it?\nAfter the smoke cleared outside the main building, it can be seen that the Golden Gumiho’s fur was scorched. It was even more terrible to watch the blood pouring from the openly burnt flesh.\nShhh!\nThe scorched tail around the building fell down. Hu Bong, Mun Ran-yeong, and Baekgi managed to stand there because of their regeneration, but Yu So-hwa and Lim So-hye had collapsed.\n“Miss Gumiho! Are you fine?”\nHu Bong was saved thanks to her, so he asked to know her condition.\nHowever, each tail around the building had fallen.\n— thud!\n“Miss Gumiho!”\nBesides Hu Bong, the other two people looking down hurried to her.\nOnly half of the Golden Gumiho’s face remained normal.\nHer eyes, which looked out of focus, only told them to…\n[ Run away. ]\nThe fox was dying. She couldn’t speak, yet she wanted to convey this to them through her eyes.\n‘So foolish.’\nEven she, herself, considered her actions to be foolish. She even wondered why she did this when she knew she couldn’t save them from the start.\nHowever, she also knew the answer.\n‘Chun Ma…’\nShe didn’t want to see Chun Yeowun, who resembled her Chun Ma, be sad about losing the people he cherished.\n‘Will he be sad if I die?’\nTears welled in her eyes.\nIt wasn’t that she was afraid of death.\n‘I want to see you.’\nShe wanted to see his face just once before she died.\n“Foolish beast.”\nGrand Duke Everdan, looking down at the Gumiho and the others around her, reached out his hand.\n“I will show you mercy and kill you all right now.”\nWoong!\nSilver light shone on his fingers. The size of this was much larger than the flash before. Which meant he intended to destroy the entire area.\n“There will be no more miracle, beast. As well as for you, humans who tried to attack me.”\nThe shame isn’t something he could recover from if he killed them once with his Advanced Awakening, but it was his way to repay such humiliation.\nHu Bong, Mun Ran-yeong, and Baekgi closed their eyes in despair, knowing they couldn’t stand it.\nHowever, their despair vanished as they felt hopeless for disappointing their Lord.\n‘Lord.’\n‘Lord Chun Ma.’\nKwaaang!\nThe huge silver flash came onto them.\nIt was then…\nCrack!\nThe space where the silver flash should have hit was distorted, and something like a black hole was creamed. It was a swinging black space.\nAnd it sucked in the silver flash.\n“No!”\n“The silver flash is gone?”\nThe members of the cult and the demons trying to brace for the damage to it were shocked. Even Grand Duke Everdan was flustered.\n‘What is that?’\nNo one should have been able to block his attack unless they had the same strength as him or the Demon King.\nWooong!\nCreepy!\nAt that moment, he raised his head at the eerie feeling that came from above and saw…\n— a Gate? When?\nA massive Gate had opened up in the sky, and someone came out with a black suit.\n“Woahhhh!”\nHu Bong saw this and cried out. Someone came out from the Gate, and it was no other than his Lord, Chun Yeowun. Tears fell from the Gumiho, lying on the floor, looking dead.\n‘… you are late.’\nIt seemed like Chun Ma had granted her the request.\nAt the appearance of Chun Yeowun, who came back, all the Sky Demon Order members shouted at once.\n“Woahhh!”\n“Demon God! Demon God! Demon God!”\nThe demons were puzzled when the morale of the humans, which had been suppressed due to the Advanced Awakening, suddenly surged.\n‘Why are these people suddenly acting like this?’\nWoong!\nThat wasn’t the end.\nNumerous beings began to appear from the open Gate. At first, they seemed to be around 1500 people, but they were demons.\n— Ka-Kaliaf?\nGrand Duke Everdan couldn’t hide his shock. The demon in a red coat with a golden crown on the right side of Chun Yeowun was Grand Duke Kaliaf.\n‘Why is he there?’\nAnd at the left was a demon with green eyes with tremendous power wearing a ragged black coat.\nHe was Duke Joseph, the Night King of the Bamut prison.\nAfter he came out of that place, his form turned back to normal and displayed his green hair and tall figure.\n“What should we do?”\n“Give us the order, Master.”\nAt the attitude of the two high-ranking demons bowing their heads, the demons under the Demon King couldn’t understand this situation.\n‘Why are they doing that?’\nChun Yeowun looked at the ground and had the order in the coldest voice.\n“Kill all of them. Not a single one lives.”\nWith that, Grand Duke Kaliaf shouted loud to inform the demons behind.\n“You heard that! Our Master has commanded!”\n“Yes, Your Highness!!!”\nSwoosh!\nThe demons that appeared from the Gate rushed to the ground at once.\nAngel’s Corner\nNo Angel’s Corner the other day since I was super busy. The definition above is by yours truly 😎. And, yay! Demon King Taura vs. Demon God Chun Yeowun is coming soon! I’m telling you since it’s kinda not a spoiler anymore. Right? hehe",

      "content": "Chapter 209: Rise of the Demon King (3)\n“Woahhhhh!!!!’\nThe war situation changed once again due to the appearance of the demon clan under Chun Yeowun.\nThey included the demons in the prison, who numbered over 500 and were all equal to Count or even Marquis level demons.\nThe faces of the demons under the Demon King were dyed in tension at the tremendous power they felt.\n“They’re coming!”\n“Stop them!”\nThe demons gathered against the opponents they could fight well.\n‘W-what is this?’\nCommander Cho Yun, who was there with the National Guard, was in a trance, forgetting about what had happened before that led him to the Yongchun site. What would he do now?\nNot a single person under his command could say anything.\nDemon King Taura’s eerie and sharp eyes were looking at one being: Duke Joseph, who was back in his normal form.\nThe green glow in his eyes sent a ghastly look towards the Demon King, but Duke Joseph looked nothing like the last time Demon King Taura had seen him.\n‘He was alive?’\nThe Demon King was sure that Duke Joseph was dead, but when he had appeared through the Gate, only one thought went through his mind: the seed of strife.\nEven since Taura ascended to the throne of the Demon King, Duke Joseph had constantly threatened his existence.\n‘Kaliaf….and Joseph.’\nThe two beings who doubted him were now together; how could this be anything but a good opportunity? The Demon King smiled.\n“Now, I can kill them both.”\nSmile!\nAlthough he was just expressing his emotions, a tremendous and intimidating sensation emanated throughout the area.\n‘!!!’\nAll eyes were focused on him.\n‘What pressure!’\n‘Is he a monster?’\nThe Demon King’s presence brought fear into everyone on the battlefield.\nHis ferocious aura was even strong enough to suffocate them.\n‘Taura!’\nDuke Joseph, who was about to descend to the ground at Chun Yeowun’s command, stopped. He realized that the energy was menacing enough to terrify the others, although he himself was not scared at all.\nFor a long time, he had hated just one being, and now was an opportunity he couldn’t let go of.\n“Tauraaa!!!”\nDuke Joseph covered his face with his right hand as a great pressure rose about and his whole body was dyed green.\nA disgusting smell spread out: the putrid smell of poison.\n“Duke Joseph!”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf, who was heading down, couldn’t hide his shock. He was worried that this might happen and it did.\nDuke Joseph was the one who always had habored anger towards Demon King Taura before coming through the Gate, prompting Kaliaf to try to deter him.\n“Duke Joseph, doing it alone is impossible—”\n“Kaliaf!”\nHe then heard someone scream. Grand Duke Kaliaf turned his head just as he saw a silver light flying towards him.\n“Everdan!”\nRed eyes shone within a fully silver form: it was Everdan in his Advanced Awakening form.\n“How dare you break the law and do this!”\nHe was convinced that Kaliaf was committing treason, and was flying in to stop him.\nGrand Duke Kaliaf was perplexed at Everdan’s actions. In terms of strength, he was a step ahead of Everdan, although after losing an arm to Chun Yeowun, his body was damaged and his strength was not up to par..\n‘I can’t do anything.’\nHe couldn’t handle him. Grand Duke Kaliaf raised his hand to his face and tried to use Advanced Awakening, but,\nShh!\nSomeone blocked Grand Duke Everdan, who was flying in quickly.\n“Huh?!”\nGrand Duke Everdan immediately moved up avoid being blocked and lightly moved his hand to cut down the hindrance.\nBaaang!\nThe opponent however, simply blocked his attack. However, the successful block wasn’t even the most surprising part:\n‘A human?’\nIt wasn’t someone from the demon clan who blocked his attack, but rather a human: Chun Yeowun.\nEverdan had forgotten about Kaliaf’s betrayal, and was now more concerned about the human.\n“Human, you seem to be quite a lot. I want to play with you but I do not have the time to deal—”\n“Did you do that?”\n“What?”\nChun Yeowun extended his finger, pointing at the form of the golden Gumiho with burned fur and skin.\nAlthough it was such a horrible sight, Everdan laughed.\n“I see. Looks like you want to take revenge for that beast.”\n“So you did that?”\nChun Yeowun’s voice seemed strange. Taking the chance, Grand Duke Everdan provoked him.\n“Isn’t it nice to eat something once it is burned? If you want, I can make you like—”\nTak!\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun’s hand went to his head.\nGrand Duke Everdan, who felt defenseless as it happened, thought the attempt was absurd.\n“How dare you, a human, hold the head of a Grand Duke—”\n“Are you ready for this?”\n“What?”\nCrack!\n“Kwaaak!”\nBefore Grand Duke Everdan could even ask what\nthis\nwas, Chun Yeowun’s finger poked into his head. The Grand Duke’s Advanced Awakening body, which he was so proud of, was pierced as Chun Yeowun’s finger kept digging in deeper.\n“You bastard!”\nBoth of the hands of Grand Duke Everdan,who was angry and in pain, were dyed in flashing silver lights: Silver Flash.\nAs if controlling the lights, he tried to cut Chun Yeowun’s body in half, but Chun Yeowun’s hands were quicker.\nKwang!\n“Kuack!”\nCrack!\nWhen Chun Yeowun struck down the head with the motion of a hammer, Grand Duke Everdan’s neck broke with the sound of his head digging into his body, which fell limp onto the ground.\nSwoosh! Thud!\n“I’ll be back. Stay here for a second.”\nChun Yeowun said to Kaliaf and went down to the ground.\nGrand Duke Kaliaf, who was watching everything unfoled, pointed Chun Yeowun to the place where Duke Joseph was rushing to: the Demon King.\n‘This…’\nHe had to stop the Demon King. The neck of Grand Duke Everdan, who had fallen down, grew from his body as he returned.\nDududuk!\nAlthough not as proficient as Grand Duke Kaliaf, he was regenerating. Grand Duke Kaliaf shook his head to the side as if feeling dizzy.\nKuak!\nFrom that one blow, Grand Duke Everdan realized that his opponent wasn’t any weaker than him.\n‘Is he actually human?’\nThe blow that Chun Yeowun inflicted caused a serious injury to him, something he had never experienced since becoming a Grand Duke.\nSwoosh!\nChun Yeowun landed right in front of Grand Duke Everdan, who hurriedly tried to stretch out his hand to hit Chun Yeowun with the silver flash. At that moment, however, something passed through his shoulder.\nSlash!\n“Kuak!”\nHis right arm was severed before he could use it.\n‘This is some crazy shit!’\nLosing the chance to attack, Grand Duke Everdan panicked and moved back.\n‘I will die if this continues.’\nGrand Duke Everdan, who judged that moving back was the best move, decided to use Silver Flash on his entire body.\nWooong!\nUsing Silver Flash on his whole body was something he could only use while in his Advanced Awakening state, and it would cause enemies who attacked him to receive damage as well.\n‘It would be better to keep this distance than to subdue him…’\nSwoosh!\nHowever, Chun Yeowun appeared right in front of him. Despite the sudden presence that approached him once more, Grand Duke Everdan stayed still as Chun Yeowun stretched out his hand.\n‘Idiot!’\nGrand Duke Everdan laughed at Chun Yeowun’s attempt to attack him; his entire body was protected by Silver Flash so Chun Yeowun’s close-combat would benefit Everdan.\nHowever, it only turned out to be an illusion.\nWheik!\nChun Yeowun’s hand filled with black flames.\n“Huh?”\nChun Yeowun’s hand, dyed in black flame, then grabbed Grand Duke Everdan’s face.\nChik!\nThe Silver Flash that Grand Duke Everdan used on his own face then began to burn and Chun Yeowun didn’t hesitate to throw the Grand Duke to the floor.\nKwaaang!\nThe moment he hit the floor, the ground cracked. The force was so powerful that a 100 meter wide crater was created on impact.\nHowever, the pain that Grand Duke Everdan felt was more intense than that.\nWheik!\nBlack flames spread from his face to his entire body, burning down the Silver Flash surrounding his body and penetrating into his body.\nChik!\n“Kuaaak!”\nGrand Duke Everdan screamed at the black flame burning him on the inside and outside. He struggled to escape Chun Yeowun’s grasp, but the more he squirmed and resisted, the stronger the flame burned.\n“Let go! Kuak! Please! Let—”\nChun Yeowun spoke to the suffering demon,\n“Didn’t you say things are better burnt? Let’s burn you to a crisp.”\n‘T-this bastard?’\nAt those words, Grand Duke Everdan felt chills run down his spine; the burning he received was exponentially worse than what he had inflicted on the Gumiho.\nThe golden Gumiho, who was losing her consciousness, saw something black appear in her eyes, which had no energy.\n‘This?’\nIt was Grand Duke Everdan, who was fully black; the only things that stood out from his figure were his crimson eyes.\n“Please… please… just kill me.”\nGrand Duke Everdan looked at her, begging to be killed. He was in so much pain because the seemingly undying black flames, which would eternally torture him as his body regenerated through the flames.\nIt was refreshing to see such a monster begging.\n“It is unfortunate that a Great Yokai beast had to fight such trash.”\nA blunt voice rang in her ears, and upon hearing it, her eyes lit up.\n‘Chun Ma…’\nWhen she opened her eyes, she saw Chun Yeowun holding the nape of the demon, causing her to grin.\n‘They are so alike.’\nEven though he never said it, Chin Yeowun hated it when she touched him. Every time she saw Chun Yeowun, she was reminded of the same scent as the first Chun Ma, which made her feel faint\nWith the last of her strength, she expressed her will:\n“I am… glad… I got… to… see… you… before… I died.”\nHer energy was barely detectable and she was tire, but seeing Chun Yeowun for the last time meant a lot to her.\n“You… came… sooner… than… your… ancestor...”\nThe golden Gumiho lost the last signs of life in her eyes, prompting Chun Yeowun to place his hand on her forehead.\n“Who’s sending you away?”\n“If you like… me… so much… don’t… pretend otherwise…”\n“Don’t get it mixed up.”\nWoong!\n‘!?’\nAt that moment, yokai energy rushed through her forehead.\n‘Ah!’\nHer eyes, which were dulled and out of focus, trembled.\nIf she had simply been given yokai energy it would have taken time for her to accept it, but Chun Yeowun didn’t use just any yokai energy: the yokai energy he gave her was her own.\n“Instead of giving you my power, I’ll let you take yours back.”\nIt was her yokai energy that he had absorbed in the past and was finally utilized properly. The body of the Gumiho, which had been burned and was trembling, began to regenerate again.\nLooking at her improving condition, Chun Yeowun mumbled,\n“Have some more.”\nAt those words, the golden Gumiho grinned.\nMeanwhile, something horrible was happening in the sky.\n“Kuaaak!”\nDuke Joseph had his neck in the hands of the Demon King; he had rushed ahead only to tragically die as he was exhaling green poison.\nHis lower body seemed to be in a horrible state.\n“Kuak!... Kuak!”\nFar away, Grand Duke Kaliaf’s Advanced Awakening was stopped by a huge black hand.\n‘This… this difference…’\nDuke Joseph, who had grown stronger in Bamut, was amazed.\nHe, who was the best of the three Grand Dukes, had jumped in, but the result didn’t change.\nThe Demon King hadn’t even True Awakened; his power could be as strong as God.\n“What, did you believe you could attack? Duke Joseph, you should have hidden yourself till the end.”\nDemon King Taura laughed at their mistakes with an eerie smile. With difficulty, Joseph answered,\n“Lari…”\n“What?”\n“Larisha is back”\n“La…risha?”\nThe lower body of Demon King trembled. Puzzled by what was happening with the Arisha armor on his body, he felt a sharp energy.\nPak!\nDemon King Taura removed his hand from Duke Joseph as a black line cut through the air.\nSlash!\nIf he was a moment later, the wrist holding Duke Joseph would have been cut.\n‘This..’\nShh!\nThe Demon King’s eyes narrowed as he felt the power and raised his head towards Chun Yeowun.\n“Are you the Demon King?”\nThe Demon King frowned at Chun Yeowun, who was speaking arrogantly from a higher position in the sky.",

      "content": "Chapter 210: Demon God, the Great Demon King (1)\n“Human.”\nThe Demon God's Evil Eye exuded vicious energy. It was utterly unacceptable for someone to look down on the Great Demon King.\nEspecially if that someone was a human.\nShhh!\nThe Demon King looked at Chun Yeowun. A strong feeling of pressure suddenly arose from above, trying to weigh down the human.\n“Master!”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf exclaimed in shock. A massive black hand appeared over Chun Yeowun's head, attempting to crush him like an insect. Chun Yeowun swiftly grabbed his sword.\nWoong!\nA huge invisible sword with a faint black color appeared above Chun Yeowun’s head and blocked the enormous black hand that was about to crush him.\nPang!\nA tremendous wind sprang up all around them as the two forces collided. It was more than enough to draw the attention of those fighting around.\nThe Demon King’s eyes then shone.\n‘He isn’t an ordinary human.’\nThe ability he displayed wasn’t something a human could stop. Even Grand Duke Kaliaf, who was known to be the strongest of the Grand Dukes, was caught by the hand and couldn’t move.\n“Are you really a human?”\nThe surprised Demon King Taura asked.\nBefore Chun Yeowun could even speak, Duke Joseph, whose lower body was shredded, shouted in pain.\n“Taura! This is the Larisha you were afraid of. You will have to come down from that throne you took by breaking the law!”\n“Larisha?”\nThe Demon King’s eyes turned cold as he looked at Chun Yeowun’s face while unable to decide what to make of Duke Joseph’s claim. Then he laughed out loud, believing it was absurd.\n“Do you think that this King cannot recognize Larisha?”\nDuke Joseph tried to refute the Demon King’s denial, but something huge appeared beneath him before doing so.\nSwosh!\n“T-this!”\nSomething black, gigantic, and round opened its mouth wide and tried to swallow him. Duke Joseph, whose injuries were so severe and hadn’t regenerated yet, was quickly caught and eaten.\nChun Yeowun used his invisible sword to stop it, but it was already too late.\nPuck!\nThe sword was stuck inside the sphere.\n‘I couldn’t even feel it.’\nChun Yeowun’s eyes darkened. At that moment, a squeaking sound came from inside the enormous black sphere.\nPhat!\nChun Yeowun moved near it and then used the stuck sword to slash it.\nSlash!\nThis time, it wasn’t just the invisible sword, but a black line split the sphere.\nPak!\nThe swallowed Duke Joseph was released afterward. As if it was a mouth, he looked like chewed food as his form now looked horrible, and his skin looked so dry like all the moisture he had left was drained.\n“Kuaaak!”\n“Duke Joseph!”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf couldn’t hide his concern. With this degree of injury, it was dangerous even if his core wasn’t damaged.\nThe Demon King approached Chun Yeowun.\nPaaah!\nAt that moment, a green-lighted pillar of fifty meters in diameter with a foul odor fell close to Chun Yeowun.\n‘Poison?’\nThe poison and green light were Duke Joseph’s ability.\nChun Yeowun quickly swung his sword.\nChak!\nThe pillar of green light immediately split and fell to the ground.\n“Ugh!”\n“U-Up!”\nA commotion began underneath them. It was okay if they were the only ones there, but there were members of the cult right beneath them and some demons as well.\n“Phew.”\nChun Yeowun stretched out his hand to the bottom then a black hole appeared, pulling in the parts of the pillar that was falling.\nShhh!\n“Pretty good.”\nSuddenly, the Demon King appeared in front of Chun Yeowun and pulled his fist at him. At that moment, the space twisted like a whirlwind.\n‘Unification of energies?’\nIt was similar to Chun Yeowun's technique. The Demon King gathered his might into a fist capable of twisting the space and punched Chun Yeowun in the chest.\n— wooo!\nA roaring sound was heard as if an explosion had happened. With that, Chun Yeowun bounced off like a ball. He flew almost a few hundred meters. Chun Yeowun's crossed wrists were severely trembling as it was the first thing to receive the impact to reduce the damage he could get from the attack.\nChun Yeowun’s eyes turned serious.\n‘Slightly above the Grand Duke level.’\nDemon King Taura didn’t just randomly wield his fist; he knew how to use his demonic powers perfectly, like how Murim warriors use their qi.\nIt has been a really long time since Chun Yeowun’s body received some damage.\nDudu!\nThe sound came from the cracked bones in his wrists being put together. This is because Chun Yeowun had tremendous regeneration ability because of the absorbed cores of the Spirit Beasts and Nano.\nPak!\nChun Yeowun sprinted through the air.\nShrr!\nAt that time, the Demon King appeared right before him again. The speed of his movement was enough for him to also be called a Wind God.\n“Your name is Larisha? He would feel ashamed if he heard it.”\nThe Demon King laughed and tried to kick Chun Yeowun. During the kick, the wind around them seemed to gather, and once again, it felt like the unification technique Chun Yeowun wields.\nAs the kick was aimed at him, Chun Yeowun drew the sword towards the Demon King’s leg.\nSlash!\nA black line appeared as Chun Yeowun’s counterattack. The Demon King quickly twisted his body to avoid it, so the black line only appeared behind him, slashing nothing.\n‘He avoided it?’\nThis was the first time this had happened — a situation where the Supreme Sky Demon Sword Art was avoided.\nThe Demon King kicked Chun Yeowun on his shoulder without giving him a chance to react.\nPang!\nHowever, Chun Yeowun managed to avoid it, and the pressure from the leg that was used to kick him went above.\nHe then tried to pierce the forehead of the Demon King.\nSwish!\nThe Demon King struck Chun Yeowun’s wrist with his other foot.\nPak! Slash!\nWith that, he was able to redirect the black line that was aimed at him.\nShhh!\nThe Demon King disappeared from there and appeared several meters above the line. Then he pretended to clasp his hands while looking at Chun Yeowun.\nAnd then…\nWoong!\nHuge black hands appeared from left and right as if trying to clap some mosquito. Chun Yeowun stretched out his swords using both hands.\nTak!\nAfter that, the two huge invisible swords arose and stabbed the giant black hands which were trying to crush Chun Yeowun.\nShhh!\nMeanwhile, the Demon King appeared from the top and tried to kick Chun Yeowun again.\n“You are done.”\nThe Demon King stated his notion, deciding it was his victory. Contrary to his belief, there was no reason that Chun Yeowun couldn’t stop it.\n“What nonsense.”\nPaaang!\nChun Yeowun motioned to kick his enemy with unified energies. The leg he used to attack collided with the Demon King’s leg that was also about to hit him. When the two kicks, which were of the same manner, clashed, the clouds in the sky were instantly pushed out.\n“Hah!”\nA smile crept across the Demon King’s lips.\nThanks to Chun Yeowun, who fights on the same level as him, a strong desire for victory replaced the other emotions.\nThe Demon King’s hand and feet moved quickly.\nPapapak!\nOf course, Chun Yeowun responded to it.\nPapapapa!\nThey hit and blocked the attacks by moving freely in the air and reading the others' attacks. Each time that happened, the clouds would move. Since they were exchanging attacks with the unification technique, it was no less than a fatal blow.\n“Oh my…”\n“The human is fighting on an equal footing with the Demon King.”\nThe demons who were watching this from below were lost in thoughts. He was the Demon King who was nothing less than a God for them. However, they saw such a God fight with a human who was supposed to be below them and should not have been able to fight on equal footing.\n“What an insane fight.”\n“…it isn’t a human’s fight.”\nThis was also true for the members of the Sky Demon Order.\nThe battle they are witnessing has an outstanding level of power that couldn’t be compared to the battles of the Murim warriors. Each time the two collided, thunder, lightning, and clouds cracked down.\n“Father.”\nChun Yu-jang approached Chun Woo-jin, the Lord. While looking at the sky, he asked,\n“Is Ancestor alright?”\n“…”\nChun Yu-jang was worried about it, and Chun Woo-jin couldn’t answer him.\nHe firmly believed in their Demon God, Chun Yeowun, who was a legend in the Sky Demon Order, but the existence from the Gate was a monster that humanity had never faced.\nThe confrontation between the two beings was already on another level, to the extent that they thought it was a war between the gods.\n“I am only certain of one thing.”\n“Uh?”\n“The fate of the cult—no, humanity—is at stake here.”\n“Humanity!”\nThe confrontation in the sky which was happening was like a thunderstorm.\nIt was telling that this destruction wouldn’t end with just the Sky Demon Order.\n“Lord…”\nChun Yeowun’s three subordinates: Hu Bong, Mun Ran-yeong, and Baekgi, who were also in the warm below, held their breaths as they looked up at the unfathomable fight.\nThey had absolute faith in Chun Yeowun, yet their faces weren’t confident as this was a scale of fight they had never experienced.\n‘For Lord to fight this fiercely.’\nThis wasn’t Chun Yeowun’s usual style.\nLooking at the fight above, the Demon King and Chun Yeowun moved and collided where there was no time to think of a plan or breathe, and the two couldn’t even be seen with the naked eye.\nA single attack would have taken down a mountain if they were on the ground.\n‘A slight mistake in the fight….’\nThere will always be a difference between winning and losing, and a sight they had never seen before might unfold.\nIt might be the defeat of Chun Yeowun, the Demon God.\n“It could be dangerous… Hu Bong.”\nUpon hearing that, Hu Bong shouted at Baekgi’s words.\n“What nonsense! Our Demon God doesn’t lose to a Demon King! Ugh! Our Lord will win!!”\nHearing Hu Bong’s cry, the cult members began to cheer.\n“Demon God! Demon God! Demon God!”\nThe cheers, which came one after another, spread throughout the Yongchun Group.\nCheering boosts morale. At that, even the demons under the Demon King began to shout.\n“Demon King! Demon King! Demon King!”\nA battle between their heads.\nTheir shouts which were cheers of support, couldn’t be heard by those above.\nBoth the ones above couldn’t hear the screams as they were focused on their battle.\nPaaang!\nThe two clashed their fists and bounced back. The Demon King’s eyes were much sharper than before. Rather than winning, the fight, which constantly extended, was hurting his pride.\nLooking at Chun Yeowun, he said,\n“You are pretty good for a human. You are the first to fight like this against me other than Larisha and Talisha.”\n“Same here.”\nChun Yeowun responded briefly. It was also the first time he had seen something this strong.\nIt had been a long time since he had a fight where he couldn’t miss his concentration.\n‘But this isn’t his full power.’\nThe Demon King hadn’t awakened yet.\nIt was right for Chun Yeowun to kill a monster like this before he used Advanced Awakening, but the opponent could dodge the Supreme Sky Demon Sword Art.\n‘It is fine. An enemy who can avoid that sword….’\nThe world is wide—the Demon King has proved that the single sword which could destroy everything wasn’t invincible.\nThen the Demon King spoke again to Chun Yeowun.\n“I can see why Larisha was obsessed with humans. Good. I’ll give you a chance.”\n“Chance?”\n“An honor for you to become the right arm of the King.”\nAt that chance which was presented, Chun Yeowun laughed.\nThe words that came out of Grand Duke Kaliaf's mouth were the same.\n“Are you seriously laughing right now?”\nThe Demon King’s expression went stiff with displeasure. With that, Chun Yeowun shook his head and said.\n“You need to be stronger than me to be able to say something like that”\nThe Demon King suddenly laughed at his words.\n“Kuahahahaha!”\nThe Demon King, who laughed like a crazy man, immediately reached Chun Yeowun. Quickly, Chun Yeowun used the sword to defend.\nThen suddenly, a certain energy in Chun Yeowun’s head had scattered.\n‘This?’\nThe Demon King smiled at it.\n“Did you think that this King who fought you will be unaware of the power you possess?”\n“…”\n“It is something I passed to the three Grand Dukes.”\nOne of the scattered abilities was the Advanced Awakening that Chun Yeowun absorbed from Ludwig.\nAt the moment when it scattered, Chun Yeowun immediately noticed.\n“I can call back my power at any time. If you left that as the trump card, then you are mistaken. And…”\nDemon King Taura waved his hand at Chun Yeowun, and a shadow opened regardless of Chun Yeowun’s will.\nAs he pulled something….\nSwoosh!\nThey were weapons of Arisha. They were the wheel, the staff, and the spear that were kept.\nThen he continued speaking.\n“You aren’t even using the most powerful weapons you have. Human.”\nChachacha!\nAs soon as he said that, the wheel, staff, and spear disassembled, turned into armor, and went to the Demon King’s body.\nA strange cry came from the armor that the Demon King wore.\n— kirrrrrrrkikrkkkkkkk!\nIt was a painful scream. The Demon King looked at Chun Yeowun's wrist and leg with dark eyes.\nHe was eying at the rest of Arisha's weapons.\n“I don’t know how you, a human, got that. However, they are the treasures that only the King, like me, can handle and exert their power. It is only through me.”\nShhh!\nAs he reached out, Arisha’s weapons on Chun Yeowuns screamed.\n— Kikiikkkkk!\n— Kyaakkkkk!\nThey were screaming as if they were desperate to escape, and soon enough, they were dismantled.\nChachacha!\nOne turned into a whip, and the other turned into a blade, then quickly flew to the Demon King and turned into a wrist guard and an ankle guard.\nIt wasn’t something they could stop. However, the Demon King’s expression turned strange.\nHe motioned to pull one thing.\n‘Why?’\nA single weapon didn’t come back to him. It was the right wrist guard, the sword.\n“Come here.”\nThe Demon King tried to pull it again.\nWoong!\nAnd the black wrist guard changed into a sword. Seeing that, the Demon King smiled.\nHowever…\nChak!\nIt moved to Chun Yeowun’s hands as it turned into a sword, not to him. The Demon King couldn’t understand it.\n“Why?”\nIn his reaction, Chun Yeowun looked at the sword in his hand. They called this as Arisha’s sword, starting with the Demon King, but it wasn’t that for Chun Yeowun.\n“Sky Demon Sword.”\nWoong!\nAt Chun Yeowun’s call, a clear resonance sounded from the sword. As if it was answering its master’s call.",

      "content": "Chapter 211: Demon God, the Great Demon King (2)\nThe Sky Demon Sword resonated.\nDemon King Taura couldn’t understand it. All of Arisha’s armors were mentally connected to the power of the Demon King and those who inherited the title.\nTherefore, no matter who it was, others could not bring out the true abilities of the weapons. However, the sword rejected the King’s call.\n“Come.”\nHe tried to retrieve the sword by increasing his power, but the Sky Demon Sword didn’t move from Chun Yeowun’s hand, causing anger to arise in the Demon King’s eyes.\n“You, who are supposed to protect the King, choose your own master? Fine. Then I will kill the master you like so much.”\nChachachak!\nWhen the Demon King extended his hand, the guard on his ankle turned into a whip.\n“Huh!”\nHe then swung it as it extended towards Chun Yeowun. In response, the Sky Demon Sword resonated and shook as if asking to be swung.\nChun Yeowun smiled as he held onto it.\n“You seem to know, Sky Demon Sword.”\nChachacha!\nChun Yeowun wielded the Sky Demon Sword in response to the approaching whip. As Chun Yeowun waited for the approaching whip, the Demon King shouted,\n“Arisha’s whip is used like this.”\nWheik!\nWhen he injected his own demonic power into the whip, the whip turned thick and infinitely long, rotating around Chun Yeowun like a barrier.\nArisha’s whip had the ability to seal the opponent and surrounded Chun Yeowun slowly, reducing the space around him.\nChun Yeowun held out the sword.\n‘Demon God Sword Art.’\nWhen he moved the Sky Demon Sword next, he performed the most splendid sword art.\nChachacha!\nTwenty four forms of swords interlocked into a complex form as they moved and created a net: this was the 3rd form of Demon God Sword Art.\nChachacha!\nThe sword art created a sharp net like a tornado, repelling the pressure from the tightening whip.\nThe whip, which was trying to trap him, couldn’t help but be thrown off as the Demon King extended his other hand.\n“Go and help.”\nChachacha!\nThe helmet then disassembled into the wheel and moved at an incredible speed towards the whip.\nThe armor of his lower body also disassembled into 12 daggers.\nSwoosh!\nThe flying wheel and the 12 daggers were imbued with the Demon King’s powers and moved to target Chun Yeowun’s limbs. Seeing the weapons move, Chun Yeowun mumbled,.\n“It's been a while since I went back to the basics.”\nWith that, Chun Yeowun stretched out his hand into the shadow realm and pulled out something.\nSrng!\nIt was a sword with a white blade that made the sharpest sound: the White Dragon Blade, one of Chun Yeowun’s two great weapons, was revealed.\nShh!\nAs Chun Yeowun held the Sky Demon Sword in his right hand and the White Dragon Blade in the left, the cheers from the spectators grew stronger.\n“Woahhh!!!”\nIt was the cry of the members of the Sky Demon Order. Everyone was enthusiastic when the right and left swords of the rumored legend appeared. Chun Yeowun’s three subordinates, Hu Bong, Mun Ran-yeong and Baekgi, were also thrilled at the sight.\n“Lord, show us!”\nHu Bong exclaimed excitedly.\nWoong!\nBoth the swords in Chun Yeowun’s hands resonated.\n‘You must be happy.’\nHe thought as he held the two swords, which were happy to be back with their counterparts.\nChun Yeowun smiled, infused the two weapons with the Sky Demon energy, and started performing their respective techniques.\nChachacha!\nIn the right was Demon God Sword Art’s 4th form, the Relentless Changing Sea, while in the left was the White Dragon Blade that used Seven Slashing Blade Technique’s 7th form.\nChachacha!\nThe strongest sword and blade techniques unfolded at the same time in an unfamiliar way, and the incoming impact and effects could be felt by the Demon King.\n‘What is this?’\nThe sword and blade created a destructive flow, which wasn’t easy to deal with.\nWith a stiff expression, the Demon King moved his hand further to make sure that his three Arisha’s weapons could pierce through a gap.\nBut,\nChachacha!\nThere was no gap because the sword and blade were moving together perfectly. Unexpectedly, the weapons of Arisha were being caught in the weapons’ violent movements and thrown out uselessly.\nPak!\n‘Huh?’\nWhen the three weapons of Arisha were deflected, Demon King Taura couldn’t help but feel flustered.\nDuring the third war, these three weapons were the combination he used to defeat Talisha’s closest aides at the same time.\nChachacha!\nAs techniques unfolded on both sides and three of Arisha’s weapons thrown away by their synergy, the sword and blade rushed towards the Demon King.\nWith a stiff expression, he shouted,.\n“You seem to know martial arts, but don’t push your luck!”\nWoong!\nBlack light shone from his eyes and something huge appeared in front of Chun Yeowun, who was wielding the sword and blade.\nIt was a gigantic sphere that was about a hundred yards tall, much larger than the one that had been used to eat Duke Joseph.\nKwaaaaa!\nThis time, Chun Yeowun was the target of the black spphere, causing the members of the Sky Demon Order to hold their breath out of anticipation and anxiety.\nThe demons under the Demon King began to cheer.\nBut,\n“Right, I knew this would come.”\nChun Yeowun’s eyes, which were focused on properly wielding his weapons, were as sharp as ever. At that moment, a change happened in the trajectory of the weapons.\nJjkkkk!\nThe space, which was touched by the blade and sword, was broken.\n‘Space Sword!’\nIt was the Space Sword!\nHe wove the Space Sword into the techniques of the sword and blade on either side to create a Space Sword that was twice as powerful.\nEven the Demon King Taura was terrified of the change.\n“You seem to be talented, but your attempt is futile. Enough.”\nThe black sphere opened its mouth wider than ever. The Space Sword, which had become one with the techniques dug, into the black sphere created by the Demon King.\nHamp!\nEveryone then saw the black sphere consume Chun Yeowun.\n“L-Lord!”\nHu Bong was surprised by the sight, as he thought that Chun Yeowun’s technique would slice through sphere. However, the sphere ended up devouring him.\n“Ahahaha! There we have it!”\n“Did you think that anyone could survive in front of His Majesty Demon King’s Dimensional Creature?”\n“Still, he fought well for a human, but the end is the same.”\nThe result created an atmosphere full of happiness from the Demon King’s army, which was convinced that the Demon King won.\nHowever, this happiness didn’t last long.\nJjkkk!\nThe sound of something cracking was heard by everyone, distorting Demon King Taura’s expression.\nCrack!\nA crack formed in the huge sphere; the demons who watched it were bewildered.\n“I-it’s splitting.”\nJkkk!\nLight shone from within the crack. The Demon King’s face was very telling that something had gone wrong and he finally let out a scream.\n“Kuaaak!”\nAt the same time, black smoke came from his mouth.\nCrackle!\nParts of the black sphere cracked and bounced in all the directions, and the traces of the swords that destroyed it could be seen.\n“Lord!”\n“Woahh!!!”\nThe members of the Sky Demon Order cheered at once they saw Chun Yeowun.\nChun Yeowun had destroyed the black sphere, but he didn't stop there and moved towards the Demon King while still using the Space Sword.\nJjkkkk!\nThe technique moved like a tidal wave as it was imbued with the Space Blade and tried to sweep away the Demon King, who was coughing out black smoke.\n“You!”\nThe Demon King, whose Dimensional Creature broke, flew back. Not missing the chance, the Space Sword went after him.\nDemon King wiped away the soot from the black smoke that was on his lips, revealing a sneaky smile.\n“Alright, I acknowledge you. You are worthy of being an enemy of mine! But now, I will show you the true power of the King.”\nSwoosh!\nMoving back, the Demon King covered his face with both of his hands. Seeing that, Chun Yeowun’s eyes widened as he kept unfolding the Space Sword.\n‘Advanced Awakening?’\nNo, this seemed different. The act of covering the face with just one hand and gathering all the demonic power at one point and exploding it out was the essence of the Advanced Awakening.\nThen,\nWoong!\nAt that moment, the space where the Demon King was turned black. But, it didn’t stop there: in an instant, the entire area was dyed in black.\nThanks to that, the Space Sword suddenly had to confront the black space.\nChachacha!\nThe violent pounding resounded everywhere, as if the two swords were hitting something sturdy like a wall.\n“Oh my…”\n“J-just what is that…”\nThe members of the Sky Demon Order were shocked by the sight.\nThey were stunned as they didn’t know what to believe. The black space that the Space Sword collided with in actuality was not black space.\nChun Yu-jang mumbled in a trembling voice.\n“G-Giant!”\nEveryone looked up, seeing a pitch-black giant large enough to bring night onto the Yongchun site. At first glance, it seemed like a four hundred meter tall black sheet.\nHowever, the demonic power that is exuded was suffocating the people of the Sky Demon Order. The Space Sword couldn’t cut through its existence and was blocked.\n“H-how can that be killed?”\nThe giant appearance that people thought only existed in stories was in front of them.\nShhh!\nThe demons didn’t cheer at the Demon King’s changed form, but rather knelt down and bowed to him.\nIt was a courtesy to the King’s transformation into his true Demon King form.\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun, who was wielding the Space Sword, stopped and moved as far away as he could. The Demon King’s eyes, which seemed to be pure manifestations of evil, were looking down at him.\n“Human.”\nHe uttered a single word that echoed around. Just one word was indescribably electrifying.\n“I will pay a tribute to your strength. This is the third time that I, the King, will show the true form to anyone after Larisha and Talisha.”\nIt was hard for him to bear the consequences of using his true form, so he tried not to overuse it.\nThe Demon King.\nHis awakened body that contained all the demonic power of the past Demon Kings.\nIt was no exaggeration to say he had enough power to destroy a planet alone.\n“In front of this King, the power to manipulate the space is nothing! I will now show you the power to rule both Heaven and Earth!”\nGrrr! Bang!\nDark clouds gathered in the sky as if heaven and earth responded to his call. Darkness was everywhere, thunder and lightning raged across, and hurricane winds blew in every direction.\nTremble!\nThe earth shook like an earthquake, and everyone on the ground could feel the change of heaven and earth and were filled with fear.\n“I-is this really…”\nCho Yun, the commander, fell to the ground. Despite being soldiers, the officers rest of the army were humans and thus lost all hope.\n“The end.”\nThe sound of completely giving up came from the golden Gumiho’s mouth. She was someone who believed in Heaven and Earth, but the scene she was witnessing made it impossible for her to have any remaining hope.\n“This… is the realm of Gods.”\nIt wasn’t something a human or yokai beast could handle.\nShe thought that even if the 1st Chun Ma was revived, he Wouldn’t triumph against the Demon King.\n“Human, it was interesting. Now I will erase you and those beneath you from the world.”\nKukukuku!\nThe giant Demon King slowly moved his hand towards Chun Yeowun, but as he looked down at Chun Yeowun’s form, it suddenly disappeared and appeared in front of his face.\n“Spatial Movement? In my hand I will—”\n“Demon King.”\n“?”\nChun Yeowun cut off his words and called him.\nDemon Kong looked at Chun Yeowun, who was smaller than a bug to him, with puzzled eyes as Chun Yeowun smiled and asked,\n“The power to rule Heaven and Earth, was it? Then, I should show you.”\n“What do you mean?”\nHe narrowed his eyes and looked at a smiling Chun Yeowun, who raised his hand up.\n“This is the Void that moves even the principles of the universe.”\n“Universe?”\nWoong!\nThat was when a huge change occurred in the sky, which turned dark. Everyone who watched the phenomenon from the ground had their mouths wide-open out of shock.\n“L-Look there!”\n“The Sky is splitting open!”\nThe sky was splitting even higher than where the giant Demon King was.\nIn the cracked sky was not blue but rather the universe of countless stars.\n“The universe?”\n“Are we looking at the universe?”\nEveryone was confused.\nEven the giant Demon King’s eyes trembled at the appearance of the universe.\n“What the hell…”\nThis wasn’t really the universe, but rather the chaos itself that was created when Heaven and Earth were split.\nChun Yeowun clenched his teeth and with his hands in the air, as if pulling the universe with all his might.\nCrack! Goooo!\nThe universe, which was filled with starlight, began to shake.\n“You, what are you trying to do?”\n“Look, that is my power.”\nAs soon as Chun Yeowun finished speaking, all stars began simultaneously move in the shaking and trembling universe.",

      "content": "Chapter 211: Demon God, the Great Demon King (3)\nNano Suit (Gatelinium Nano Suit) — a black tight-fit suit made out of Gatelinium that looks like armor with no gaps.\n“There! Look over there!”\n“The stars are shaking!”\nThe universe was revealed in the open sky. Stars seemed to fall from the sky at any moment in the fast-moving universe.\nThose who watched it from the ground were shocked.\nOf course, humans weren’t the only ones astounded by the unbelievable sight.\n“D-does that make sense?”\n“How can this happen?”\nEven the demons who were bowing to the Demon King were now confused. The appearance of the starlight, which seemed to burst, wasn’t some scenic sight.\nThere were meteors in it.\n“Really!”\n“T-they are falling!”\nIt was true. The stars grew huge and started falling, turning the scene into a meteor shower—the sight of meteors falling right in front of their eyes.\nIt turned the lightning, thunder, and hurricane into nothing.\n“T-this… is crazy!”\n“Is he going to blow up the planet?”\n“Everyone avoid it!”\nThey considered the power of the Demon King a wonder. However, even the demons were experiencing fear for the first time when they looked at the meteor shower continuously pouring down from space.\n“You bastards! This is the true strength of my Lord!”\nHu Bong suddenly felt happy as he shouted at the demons. Suddenly, holding his shoulder, Mun Ran-yeong spoke in a worried voice.\n“Bong Bong… shouldn’t we avoid it?”\n“Honestly, why are you saying….”\n“Say that after looking\nup\n?”\n“Up? Up… Oh.”\nSwoosh!\nThe sight of the meteor shower in the cracked sky seemed like it could destroy everything. The meteors kept coming closer, bigger, and more dangerous.\nThe demons didn’t just feel the pressure but even those of Earth.\n‘This man is….’\nThe eyes of the Demon King, who was still in his giant form, shook. At this force, it seemed like the demon-like human didn’t mind destroying the entire Earth along with him.\n‘A sacrifice?’\nOtherwise, one wouldn’t do such a thing.\n“You are truly crazy, human.”\nThe Demon King could no longer stand what he was seeing. He didn’t expect things would turn out like this. He then moved his gigantic body.\nDuuuuuu!\nAs if holding the sky, the Demon King stretched out his hand towards the place where the meteors moved.\nIn the place where he reached out, black discs appeared orderly and formed into a shield.\n“Coming!”\n“Everyone avoid it!”\nEveryone moved away, from demons to Sky Demon Order members. Large chunks of light were dropping from the sky.\nSwoosh!\nPang! Pang!\nWhen the chunks of light collided with the black disc, they shattered, splattering their bits all over the place. As a result, they tumbled to the ground, surrounded by flames.\nBang! Bang!\nMaybe it was luck? The fragments all fell outside the Yongchun Group.\nPapapang!\nIt was an unusual sight.\nIt appeared as though Chun Yeowun was trying to destroy the world, and the Demon King was urgently attempting to stop him, given how frequently he made the black discs.\nHowever, the falling meteors or chunks of light always pierced his defenses.\nKwaang!\nOne of those huge meteors slammed into the shoulder of the Demon King.\n“\nKuak!\n”\nHis giant body swayed from one side to another.\nGrand Duke Kaliaf, who had escaped the black hand that had captured him earlier, moved Duke Joseph and gazed at the Demon King, who stood hundreds of meters tall.\n“… is it really Larisha’s Advent?”\nThe\nDemon Kings’ Existences\n.\nIt was a power possessed only by the Demon King. If it was in that state, the head of the Talisha clan had to come to take him down.\nBut then, an unbelievable thing happened.\nThe Demon King, who was the strongest, was shaken after being hit once.\n‘What is this?’\nIt was absurd that the Demon King was hurt.\nThe descending meteors, obscured by the barriers created, were now going towards the spaces between the defenses.\n‘How can he handle the meteors so freely?’\nEven the Demon King couldn't pull it off. The more objects there are around, the less control one has over the minor aspects.\nKwang!\n“\nKuak!\n”\nWas it because he was careless?\nAnother meteor struck the Demon King’s chest. The gigantic Demon King was pushed backward. It was an incredibly destructive force that the Demon King could only sustain.\nKwang! Kwang!\nAfterward, another three meteors passed through the barrier.\nTwo of them flew outside the site of Yongchun, and the other one….\n“Shit!”\n“M-Move!”\nIt was dropping exactly where the demons were swarming.\nKwakwakwang!\n“Kuak!”\n“Ack!”\nPsss!\nThe power of the stars, or whatever it was, was beyond comprehension. Around 80 demons within a 100-meter radius were reduced to ashes the instant they reached the ground.\nIt was a sight the Demon King couldn’t believe.\n‘This bastard! He is controlling this meteor shower in detail.’\nThis was something the Demon King was sure of.\nWhite particles were rapidly moving in Chun Yeowun’s eyes. It was augmented reality.\n[Panel System operation rate 170%. 68% of the user’s body is being burdened.]\nIt was the 7th Gen Nanomachine that had this computing power. That helped relieve the burden on Chun Yeowun, who was using the Sutras.\nIt made the attack more detailed and precise so as to not hurt others.\nSwoosh!\nKwang!\nAnother starlight struck the Demon King's chest.\nThe great thing was that, despite their strength, the meteors were unable to pierce the Demon King's body.\n‘He’s aiming for my chest.’\nDespite the pain, the Demon King narrowed his eyes.\nChun Yeowun guessed that the nucleus had to be in the chest no matter how the body changed.\nHowever, even after attacking twice in a row, the Demon King endured it fine.\n‘It’s not in the chest.’\nHe had to get rid of the nucleus first.\n‘Is he really human?’\nThe Demon King's eyes, which had been searching for a way to protect himself, had suddenly become serious.\nNo matter how strong the dimensional barrier he creates, it is bound to fall once the meteor hits.\nIn the end, only the defending one is at a disadvantage.\n‘Seriously…’\nHe didn’t think it would be this dangerous.\n“Is this it?”\nChun Yeowun focused on the head of the Demon King. And then three starlights there at once.\nSwoosh!\nThe Demon King's eyes turned strange, looking at them flying straight for his head at a frightening speed.\nSomething flashed through his mind.\n[ Taura. You have an innate sense of battle, but your views are too traditional. An increase in bulk and volume indicates that your body is being exposed to a greater degree. ]\n[ Even so, if the power grows, the opponent will be knocked out instantly... ]\n[ That is if the enemy is weaker than you. ]\n[ Then what will be excellent? Larisha. ]\n[ Consider your options thoroughly. Once this happens, you will have exceeded your existing restrictions. ]\nWhy was he thinking of the past? The Demon King stared at the three starlights approaching.\n‘Has he given up?’\nChun Yeowun was puzzled by the Demon King’s actions. This time, three meteors were heading for the head, so he would be harmed even if he was gigantic and powerful.\nIt was then…\nBang!\nBlack space appeared in front, covering him like a wall. How could the hundreds of meters high body of the Demon King suddenly perform such a feat?\nKwaang!\nAt that moment, the meteors hit the Demon King one after another. With a tremendous roar, the space distorted, and wind pressure rose.\nSwoosh!\nIn accordance, the body of the Demon King began to shrink.\n‘Hit it right.’\nChun Yeowun looked at the aftermath of the explosion.\nIt was a meteor shower caused by Chun Yeowun, who realized the principles of the cosmos and opened up a region of chaos, gathered chaotic energy into it, and dropped it.\nIn a way, it was nothing more than a microcosm.\nBang!\nThe flaming lights of the meteors suddenly disappeared, and someone was floating in the middle.\nIt was the Demon King Taura.\nHis appearance had just reduced to the form of a human but retained the blackness around.\nIt was only the mass that had reduced.\n“Hmm.”\nThe Demon King seemed to contemplate something as he raised his palm and looked at it.\nA demonic power he had never felt before was gushing out.\n‘Can it be this helpful to have concentrated all the power of the Demon Kings’ Existences in one point and explode it at once?’\nHe thought that\nDemon Kings' Existences\nwere the end, but he was wrong. Now he felt afraid of his power.\nClench!\nDemon King Taura clenched his fist and looked at Chun Yeowun.\n“\nHuman. I owe you a great debt of gratitude.\n”\nShh!\nHe reached up and blocked a single meteor flying towards him. The meteor blocked by the palm flashed as if it was burned and faded away.\nIt was as if he was trying out his new strength and showing it off simultaneously.\nLooking at Chun Yeowun with arrogant eyes, he said…\n“Thanks to you, I was able to change my thinking.”\n“Change… your thinking?”\n“Now, it's not only Larisha; whoever comes won’t be able to become my opponent.”\nAfter his confident declaration of power, Demon King Taura shook himself to remove something from his body, and it was the weapons, Arisha's Armor, that he was wearing.\nEveryone thought he would be up to something, but he dropped them to the ground.\nSwoosh!\n“These things are meaningless to me now.”\nHe was no longer obsessed with Arisha's Armor. Unless he had all seven, he couldn’t show his true value before, but now, he was sure that no one could harm him even without them.\n“You're far too sure of yourself.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, the Demon King laughed.\n“\nFufufufu\n, I am warning you. Five seconds from now, your human neck will be in my hands and….”\nNot letting his enemy finish his speech, Chun Yeowun held out his hand to the Demon King and pushed his palm to the right.\nWoo!\n‘??’\nThe Demon King was puzzled. He couldn’t understand what the other was doing.\n“Wh… what are you doing?”\n“The Supreme Demon Sword and the Void Sutra are combined into one.”\n“What?”\n“It is fine if you want to change your mind.”\nA sudden chill was felt. The Demon King couldn’t understand Chun Yeowun’s words, but he had an ominous feeling.\nAssuming he was on his way to victory, the Demon King attempted to go ahead and strike, but he couldn't feel his body.\n“Just what—!”\nDemon King Taura lowered his head at the weird sensation. The lower part of his chest had vanished.\nThe part was neatly cut, and it was as if his black body had disappeared along with it.\n“T-this is absurd….”\nHe felt nothing. His body and the space around it were taken away.\nCrack!\nAnd as if replacing the lost part, it was slowly beginning to be filled.\n‘I need to recover my body before it completes.’\nHe tried to restore his body, but it didn’t work.\nHe had the power to instantly restore his body. However, it was as if his body was still there, but his existence had vanished.\nHhh!\nThen Chun Yeowun appeared in front of him.\nGrab!\nChun Yeowun grabbed the Demon King’s head. He couldn't do anything to escape it because the lower part had disappeared, leaving just his chest, neck, and shoulders.\nThe Demon King, feeling a sense of crisis, shouted.\n“Wait! Human. This isn’t right. I cannot accept a defeat like this. Such a fraudulent ability.”\nCrack!\n“\nKuak!\n”\nChun Yeowun's palm sank into the chest before he could finish, and even if he was the Demon King, he couldn't do anything once the nucleus was touched.\nChun Yeowun then said to him,\n“Put the nonsense aside…\nyou\nare now in my hands, Demon King.”\nAngel’s Corner\nWhile editing this chapter, this came to my mind… So I edited it a little bit.\nThus, it has been revealed that Chun Yeowun is the next geo archon. #DOTDGxGenshinImpact",

      "content": "Chapter 213: Memory (1)\nAn unbelievable sight unfolded right before their eyes.\nAll the demons who witnessed it were shocked; the Demon King was a divine being to them since the title was for the best and the strongest warrior in their clan.\nThe fact that the Demon King was defeated by a human, a species that they had always regarded as mere insects, and not someone from Talisha’s clan, made it all the more absurd.\n“H-How could—”\n“Your Majesty!”\nChun Yeowun’s hand pierced through the heart, or nucleus, of the Demon King. If the nucleus was drawn out of his body, Taura’s existence would be reduced to ashes.\n“Master’s strength was this strong?!”\nAfter the Demon King appeared, Shakena had been in despair, but now she couldn’t take her eyes off Chun Yeowun.\nUnlike the demons, the members of the Sky Demon order cheered for him.\n“Woahhh!!!!!”\n“Demon God! Demon God! Demon God!”\nEveryone thought the end had come when hurricanes and thunderstorms began to shake the entire place.\nHowever, all of that was gone when Chun Yeowun, a legend of the Sky Demon Order, turned everything around.\n“Hehehe, see that? See? I told you Lord could do it.”\nHu Bong made a fuss out of his excitement.\n“Ahem, did I ever say he couldn’t?”\n“You seemed anxious.\nHehe\n.”\n“Hmph.”\nBaekgi shook his head and looked at Chun Yeowun.\n‘I can’t keep up.’\nAlthough Chun Yeowun was his Lord, Baekgi still wanted to close the gap in level with martial arts, but Chun Yeowun seemed to have leapt even farther away.\nChun Yeowun was like a wall he couldn’t overcome.\nThud! Thud!\nMany of the demons had dropped their weapons as if they lost their will. Victory and defeat were decided between beings who were leaders, so the war ended when the fight of the leaders ended.\n“What are you doing/!”\n“Raise your weapons now!”\nThe commanders urged them, but nothing could change the fact that they had lost.\n“What are you?”\n“Th-that…”\nThe commanders were speechless. Even if the forces on the ground were combined, they couldn’t do anything against Chun Yeowun, so how could the war continue?\nNo matter how barbaric the demons were, their ability to judge the situation was spot-on.\n“Kuaaa…”\nThe Demon King, whose nucleus had been caught, groaned. His mind was confused.\n‘\nI, the King… see defeat once again…’\nThis time, he hadn’t even been careless. Moreover, he had been convinced that no other being could be called his equal, but that confidence was shattered.\n‘I haven’t done anything yet.’\nHe had come to Earth for one reason: to get his revenge on Larisha.\nDying like this without getting it done was unacceptable.\n“Dying...like this… like this!”\nLight shone in the Demon King’s eyes.\nAs if he wanted to burn down everything one last time, the demonic power in his body exploded like a candle.\nThe Demon King yelled,\n“Think you can finish it like—”\nPuak!\n“Kuak!”\nBefore the Demon King could finish, Chun Yeowun pulled his hand out of the Demon King’s body.\nThud! Thud!\nThe nucleus of the Demon King was beating in his hand, and the Demon King who watched it was wide-eyed.\nChun Yeowun caught the nucleus as if it was a toy.\n“Huh. It’s done.”\n“You…you… human…”\nHis dignity as a king was lost. The eyes of the Demon King, who was staring at Chun Yeowun with a killing intent, lost focus. Since his nucleus was removed from his body, there was no more power to support his body.\n“I’ll take this.”\nBlue energy flowed from Chun Yeowun’s right wrist and wrapped around the nucleus in his hand, soon wrapping around the entire hand.\n‘Is he trying to absorb the power of the Demon King?’\nGrand Duke Kaliaf looked at the scene while holding his breath. As he watched the battle, the Grand Duke was shocked at how infinitely powerful Chun Yeowun’s power seemed.\nNow that the fight was over, a serious question arose in his mind.\n‘What will happen if Master, who has power that surpasses the Demon King, gains the power of the Demon King?\n’\nImagining it itself was terrifying enough.\nPaaang!\nIt was then:\nBlack energy exploded and flowed out from the Demon King’s nucleus as the previous Demonic Kings’ demonic powers that were sleeping in the nucleus also came out.\nWooong!\nThe tangible power inside shuddered wildly as if rebelling or threatening Chun Yeowun; it almost seemed as if the energy refused to be absorbed by anyone who wasn’t a demon.\n“So rebellious.”\nChun Yeowun raised the Sky Demon Energy and tried to subdue it.\nThen, a ferocious energy was emitted and the demonic power of the Kings inside the nucleus were suppressed once more.\n“Resisting is useless; if you are the Demon Kings, then I am the Demon God.”\nSky Demon Energy began to devour the demonic energy of the past Demon Kings like a beast. In front of Sky Demon Energy, all other power or energy paled in comparison.\nThe momentum of the past demonic powers weakened as they were consumed.\nSwoosh!\nThe demonic power began to rush into Chun Yeowun one after another as he began to feel the demonic power of the Demon King.\nBa-dump!\nChun Yeowun’s heart pounded as the demonic power entered his body and his vision turned black.\nWoong!\nWhen the power inside nuclei was absorbed, the information within would be transferred to his head. However, images began to flow as if he were watching a film.\n‘This is?’\nThey were from the memory of the Demon King Taura.\nUnlike other demons, Demon King Taura’s body was very different and had a strong spirit imbued into his nucleus.\nThousands of years of Demon King Taura’s memory began to play.\nMost of them were battles, but then the memories he bottled up were shown.\nSwosh!\nThe memories flowed like a film until the setting came into focus. Chun Yeowun could even feel the Demon King’s complex emotions: disappointment and hatred.\n[It isn’t possible! Larisha is recovering right now!]\nThe demons stopped him from entering the audience room.\nTaura killed those demons, forcibly opened the door, and went in. As he went in, he saw the figure of someone recovering inside a black sphere.\n‘Larisha?’\nLike the other demons, this one also had an exotic appearance. Strangely, his appearance wasn’t unfamiliar, as if he was more than just a stranger.\n[Taura?]\nThe being with its eyes closed opened them and looked. Since this was Taura’s memory, Chun Yeowun could see Larisha looking right at him.\n[Larisha]\n[I asked for nobody to be sent in.]\n[Right, but we don’t have time right now.]\nThe Demon King’s feelings were clearly felt by Chun Yeowun, who sensed that the being in the black sphere instilled fear within Taura.\nTak!\nTaura then put down a certain device: the device to open the Gate. After touching a certain button on the device, a large black hole appeared in the ceiling.\n[What are you doing?]\n[For the last time, I am going to change your intentions.]\n[What do you mean?]\n[Give me orders right now to go through this Gate and get rid of the bugs on Earth.]\nAt Taura’s words, Larisha’s expression hardened. Ignoring that, Taura continued.\n[The Larisha that I know isn’t like this. Aren’t you supposed to work for the clan? We don’t show mercy to the bugs just because of one human wench.]\n‘Human wench?’\nChun Yeowun was now intrigued, as this memory would reveal the real cause for why Larisha was trying to cooperate with humans.\nAt Taura’s words, Larisha warned him.\n[Taura, no further disrespect will be forgiven.]\nAt that, he laughed.\n[Kuahahahaha!]\nWith a ridiculing voice, Taura spoke to Larisha.\n[It seems that the information that Talisha’s sword stabbed your nucleus was correct.]\n[…]\nAt that, Larisha didn’t respond, and Taura looked at him. With a sly smile, he said,\n[I will head to Earth right now and remove everything that’s weakening you to restore you to your original state. Understand that this is out of my loyalty.]\n[Taura!]\n[I will find that woman and kill her first.]\nWoong!\nAs soon as he said that, Larisha flew towards Taura, breaking out of the black sphere that was helping him recover with a force that made it seem like he wanted kill Taura.\n[Oh… is this your answer? You really have become weak.]\nSeriously wounded, Larisha felt powerless against Taura, as the information about his nucleus being hurt seemed to be accurate. Taura grabbed Larisha’s head and looked at his chest.\n[Do you not know what my ability?]\n[Taura…]\n[It seems like you are no longer capable of leading our clan. You are not only weakened in the head but also you have a weakened heart.]\n[Such a crooked thought, Taura.]\nLarisha’s eyes were filled with anger and hatred, but also sadness.\n[Don’t look at me like that!]\nGoo\n!\nTaura began to absorb Larisha’s power. Although Larisha was weakened, he still was able to resist Taura’s absorption with a firm impression. Taura, who kept on going, scoffed once he had absorbed almost all the demonic power.\n[Disappointing. The best warrior can’t even rebel?]\nAs someone who tried to overcome his fears by strengthening his resolve, Larisha thought that it was futile and answered.\n[I end here as a King.]\n[… What are you saying?]\n[I will allow you to lead the clan, so lose your interest in Earth.]\nGrunt!\nLarisha still held onto his resolve to protect Earth despite having all of his powers taken away.\nTaura couldn’t hide his disappointment after that, and now hated Larisha.\nLarisha was the warrior he admired the most, so seeing him sacrifice his nature and heart for someone other than his clan made Taura miserable.\nClench!\nTaura lifted Larisha’s body.\n[What are you doing?]\n[You choose to neglect our clan till the end.]\n[That’s not it, Taura… You think—]\n[Enough. I know very well what you think of the clan. If Earth is so good, then go rot on the earth for the rest of your life.]\n[Taura!]\n[That is… if you can survive in this state.]\nAs if suffering from his injuries wasn’t enough, Larisha’s demonic power had been drained. If he fell to Earth in this state, his chances of surviving would be zero.\nDespite that, Taura threw Larisha’s body at the Gate without any hesitation.\n‘Horrible.’\nThat was Chun Yeowun’s only thought after watching the scene unfold.\nLike Larisha said, this man was crooked.\nShhhh!\nOnce again, Taura’s memory began to flow with other memories that just seemed like imprints of information.\nAt some point, another actual memory came, displaying the Demon King as he stood in front of the Gate, and said,\n[I will check with my own eyes to see if he is dead or not.]\nTaura’s strong obsession and doubts were trapping him.\nAfter throwing the dying Larisha into the Gate, he was under the pressure that Larisha could have survived.\n‘There are rumors that I broke the law and harmed the Demon King.’\n‘Duke Joseph, who was being pursued has disappeared.’\nToo many things were pressuring him. The pressure of breaking the clan law and killing the clan’s king were getting to him. Without another thought, Demon King Taura opened the gate.\nWoong!\nDemon King Taura, who came to Earth after opening the Gate, tried to use the powers to check if any demonic power existed on earth, which wasn’t difficult to confirm even at the most minute level.\n‘If I check from the highest point, I’ll know for sure.’\nHe then moved to the sky and began to send out demonic power as if he were a radar device.\nThe Demon King’s demonic energy spread out in every direction, but after less than a day of the demonic energy propagating everywhere, an entirely unexpected existence appeared in the sky.\n[A human?]\nIt was a human with a strong impression and wavy long hair, whose existence surprised even Chun Yeowun.\n‘Chun Ma!’\nIt was Chun Ma, his ancestor.\nWho would have thought that Taura had encountered his ancestor?\nSurprisingly, Chun Ma said something to Demon King Taura.\n[I did tell you not to pay attention to this place.]\nDemon King Taura was startled at those words and tried to deal with him.\nChun Ma then extended his sword.\nCrack!\nAt that moment, the surrounding space distorted and Chun Ma was sucked into it as a black dot pierced through the body of the Demon King.\nPus!\nIt all happened in a single instant.\n[Kuaaaak!]\nWith a gaping hole in his chest, Demon King Taura was thrown hundreds of meters away.",

      "content": "Chapter 214: Memory (2)\n‘That one…’\nVivid memories.\nChun Yeowun was shocked by what he had witnessed.\nThe technique Chun Ma just unfolded was beyond the human realm or anything he could imagine.\nThough Chun Yeowun treated his space as a sword, Chun Ma freely handed it as if the weapon were incorporated with the space.\n‘I thought I surpassed my ancestor.’\nChun Yeowun thought that he surpassed the level of Chun Ma as he ascended to the realm of Void.\nBut now, with one technique, he could see that they were still different.\n[Kuaaaa.]\nDemon King Taura’s chest regenerated rapidly. Despite that, Taura felt confused. Starting with how a mere human did this to him.\n‘No way.’\nLarisha was a Demon. However, this man he was facing seemed like a human. How can this be?\nDemon King Taura spread his hands.\nChachachacha!\nA black space opened up, and black iron items came out and stuck onto his body. It was Arisha’s Armor.\nIn any case, Taura judged that the opponent was an enemy he couldn’t handle easily and put on the armor.\n‘It was a surprise attack earlier; it won’t work again….’\nWoong!\nHowever, the space shook, and a fist came out and struck Taura’s chin.\nBang!\nCrack!\n[Kuak!]\nTaura was hit by it and flew into the sky. Taura's eyes glowed while soaring up, and a black hand appeared from the air, shielding him from being pushed upwards any farther.\nWong!\n‘It’s coming.’\nThe space resonated. Taura sensed it and quickly tilted his head to the side. At that moment, a hole pierced through the black hand.\nPhat!\nChun Yeowun, who witnessed it, felt it was terrific. The Demon King must have had a keen sense of battle, for he immediately responded to the opponent's strike after only two hits.\nHowever, the opponent was Chun Ma of the Sky Demon Order. Throughout the history of Murim, a person who could face him never arrived.\nBang!\n[\nKuak!\n]\nIt was an excellent move to dodge, but Chun Ma's leg appeared before him and kicked him in the chin once again. Chun Ma swept aside Taura in that state.\nChachcacha!\nWhat is that speed?\nThe sword was so fast that it left traces as it moved. Despite its speed, the blade was cutting through the gaps in Arisha’s Armor.\n[Kuak! Y-you bastard!]\nDemon King Taura endured the attack and tried to counter it. However, when Chun Ma pulled back the sword and thrust it again, Taura’s head flew.\nPhat!\nIn an instant, his consciousness fell away. If it hadn’t been for the unique regenerative power, dying wouldn’t seem strange.\nRumble!\nTaura became aware of the situation as soon as his head regenerated. His body is immobilized. The nucleus in the chest was also touched.\n[Move, and you’ll regret it.]\nTaura glared at Chun Ma, who warned him.\n[… who are you?]\nTaura was the king, and this man was the first to corner him like this.\nChun Ma spoke in a low voice.\n[I am the radiant flame which leads all things to darkness.]\nAs the man said those words, Taura’s nucleus began to pound. He thought this could be…\n[No… no! How can that happen?]\nHe fell into denial and disbelief.\nThen he asked.\n[Why… why are you still alive, Larisha?]\nChun Yeowun was confused when he heard it. The Demon King addressed Chun Ma as\nLarisha\n. However, wasn’t Chun Ma human?\nThe only person who could answer it was Chun Ma.\n[I am grateful to you, Taura.]\nHe really seemed to mean it.\nWith a trembling body, Taura asked.\n[Just how did this happen?]\n[It’s not as difficult as you might think.]\n[Not difficult?]\n[Why do we look like the humans of the planet Earth? Have you ever had that doubt?]\nDemon King Taura became puzzled by such statements. He used to have the same doubt the first time he came to Earth.\nUnlike other planets, beings on this planet were similar to them. Despite the physical structures being different, the appearance was strangely identical.\n[The roots of our clan originated from here.]\n[W-what do you mean?]\n[There are Gates on all planets. Our clan passed through that and settled on our world, the Demon Realm.]\nThis was Taura’s first time hearing this.\nHe was a 4th generation of the clan, and he knew that Larisha was between the 1st and 2nd generations.\n[The gravity there is several times this place. We had to evolve to it and adapt to the environment of thin air and dangerous individuals there.]\nLiving things evolve in ways to fit with their environment. They have developed themselves to survive in the barren Demon Realm.\n[We evolved? From the lowly form of these humans?]\n[Lowly is sure… they have just evolved to the optimal state of this planet.]\nTaura felt this all was absurd and smiled.\n[So you evolved to adapt to this place?]\nWhen Chun Ma didn’t deny it, Taura yelled.\n[Stop the bullshit! Are you talking about this being evolution? What you did is degenerate! Evolved to become lower-level humans who can’t live past 50 years? Ha!]\nTaura’s eyes swelled in anger. He came down with ambition, but now replaced with disappointment and hatred for the existence in front of him who was someone he respected.\nDid his King turn into a trivial human?\nThe moment he found out, he was gripped with anger and disappointment.\n[To give up the fact that we are a clan and leave for a trivial human, a person like you deserves death!]\nCrack!\nTaura forced himself to move, ignoring the energy embedded in the body. Even if his limbs were torn off, he showed such strong will.\nChun Ma’s eyes sharpened.\n[Will you not fulfill your duty as the current King?]\n[Hah! I don’t want to hear this from you!]\nChachachachacha!\nArisha’s Armor, which covered Taura’s body, was now in the form of weapons. Weapons of sword, blade, wheel, and staff all came out and rushed to Chun Ma.\n[Die!]\nPapapak!\n[You fool!]\nChun Ma held his sword and pushed it ahead. Even the Demon King’s items with the demonic power were no match.\n‘Unification of energy.’\nThe sword of Chun Ma collided with the rushing weapons.\nBang!\nA blue flash of light appeared with a great roar, and weapons were thrown out in all directions. Among them, Chun Ma caught one of the weapons.\nPak!\nIt was the sword.\nHe was trying to hold a sword containing the demonic power of the Demon King.\nWoong!\n[Have you already forgotten?]\nThe sword only moves by the power of the Demon King.\nChun Ma tried to suppress the demonic power inside the sword, raising up the Sky Demon energy and glancing at it.\n[I will take this with me, it might be helpful in the future.]\n[That belongs to the King!]\nDemon King Taura, who had been robbed of the sword that was the most powerful of Arisha's weapons, reacted angrily.\nAt that, Chun Ma pointed up and said.\n[You go back to where you are from.]\n[What?]\nLooking up, he saw a gate that was opened. Come to think of it, he couldn’t see the device he had brought.\n[Larisha!]\nCrack!\nDespite the Demon King’s whole body being unable to move, he endured and tried to raise his hand up to awaken himself.\nLooking at that, Chun Ma shook his head.\n[You are acting foolish till the end.]\nAfterward, Chun Ma raised his sword, and the energy inside Taura ran wild and ripped up his body.\nSlash! Slash! Slash!\n[Kuaaak!]\nDemon King Taura lost all his parts except for his chest and nucleus.\n[Never come back, Taura.]\nAs Chun Ma said his last warning to Taura, he forced the weakened but ranging demon into the Gate.\nThere was no use screaming, however…\n[Larishaaaaaa!]\nDemon King Taura returned to his throne through the Gate. He couldn’t hold back his anger.\n[Larishaaa]\nThe feeling of being horribly defeated by a mere human destroyed his pride.\n— kiiik!\nThe door opened, and three of his aides appeared before him, whose body was torn.\nThe three Dukes were looking for him when he suddenly disappeared. And as they witnessed him in such a weak state, they didn't hide their greedy eyes toward the injured King.\n‘!?’\nIn an instant, the day when he betrayed Larisha flashed into his mind. Karma of betrayal came to him.\n‘Did you feel this way too?’\nHe suddenly thought that.\nThen the memories scattered. That was the last of him.\nPhat!\nChun Yeowun opened his eyes to find new energy filling his whole body.\nThe Sky Demon Energy became stronger after absorbing the demonic power from the Demon King’s nucleus.\nIt seemed like it had better compatibility than the previous energies.\n‘Chun Ma… was Larisha.’\nThe truth felt weird. He had never imagined this.\n‘Then I have the blood of demons inside?’\nIn a way, it could be considered as that.\nThe blood may have faded, but the people of Chun Ma, the direct descendants, must have them within.\n‘… is this important?’\nHonestly, this changes nothing.\nChun Ma was his ancestor, that is all. He is a legend within the Sky Demon Order.\nChun Yeowun was a human, and nothing changed.\nNo, there is\none thing\n.\n‘Chun Ma, I have taken over everything you once had.’\nPaaaang!\nAs Chun Yeowun lowered his hand after covering his face, tremendous energy exploded with intense wind bursts, and his form changed to a black flame.\n“La… Larisha!”\nThe dying Demon King Taura was shocked. Who would have imagined that he would see Larisha during his last moments?\n“H-ho-how…?”\nChun Yeowun looked down at Taura and smiled.\n“Didn’t I tell you to never come back?”\n‘!!!’\nAfter hearing Chun Yeowun’s last words for him, Taura’s eyes widen as if they would burst out. His body then crumbled into ashes giving him no chance to utter any words.\nIn the end, Taura was the Demon King who suffered because of Larisha.\nWitnessing the enemy turn into ashes, cheers erupted from the ground.\n“Wahhhh!!!”\nThey were the shouts and cheers of the members of the Sky Demon Order.\nGrand Duke Kaliaf descended to the ground and pointed to Chun Yeowun, who was there and spoke to the demons.\n“The new Demon King, His Majesty! Respect him!”\n“\nUgh…\n”\nThud! Thud! Thud!\nDespite hesitating, the demons fell to the ground. They had no choice. They witnessed Demon King Taura turning to ashes.\nThe battle has ended.\nThe reign of the new King has begun.\nAt the same time, a gigantic optical telescope was installed on a peak approximately 40 kilometers away from the Yongchun site, and someone was looking through it.\nA person with a silver mask behind the man looking through the telescope asked.\n“Elder Cho. Why are you still here?”\nElder Cho didn’t face the person who asked and only made a sound.\n“Hmm…”\n“Is there some problem?”\n“This is troubling.”\n“Huh?”\nElder Cho turned his head and spoke in a firm voice.\n“I believe he will be more powerful than this old one.”\nAngel’s Corner\nYES! FINALLY! IT HAS BEEN REVEALED! Well. Given the clues, we already knew about it, but it’s still different to read it directly from the story itself, right? And gosh! The last line Yeowun said to Taura!! Hah! That was so POG! He was truly excellent at toying with the dying demon’s feelings as Taura took his last breath.\nHere is an art by chibi-flurr I found on Deviant Art that looks close enough to how I imagined Chun Yeowun’s Advanced Awakening! Love it!\nP. S. Truth be told, I’m actually a chatterbox introvert.",

      "content": "Chapter 215: The Clues to Change (1)\n“Stronger than Elder Cho?”\nThe person in the silver mask reacted with disbelief.\nHe had put Elder Cho in charge of the telescope and left to take care of business only to come back and hear such a seemingly absurd and unfathomable statement.\n“Is there really anyone in the world who can defeat Elder?”\nIt wasn’t just flattery; it was the trust he had in the Elder. For the silver-masked man, Elder Cho’s\nexistence\nwas the\nsupreme power\n.\nIn response to his words, Elder Cho made a weird expression and answered with a smile,\n“Being strong and winning are two different things.”\nThe eyes of the silver-masked man smiled when he saw that the Elder wasn’t feeling down. Suddenly, Elder Cho got up.\n“Where are you going?”\n“I need to prepare.”\n“Ah!”\n“Call the Zodiacs.”\nHearing that, the voice of the silver-masked man trembled.\n“Finally, the time seems to have come.”\nOn the forehead of the silver mask, the word\nOx\nwas engraved neatly.\n“I will carry out the order.”\nShhh!\nThe silver-masked man disappeared into thin air as if he had melted away. He seemed to be an expert at doing so since he had left so effortlessly. As he disappeared, Elder Cho mumbled,\n“Whoever survives to the end wins.”\nYongchun Group’s chairman, Chun Yu-jang, and the commander of the National Guard, Cho Yun, were in deep conversation about the recent events.\nCho Yun’s attitude was noticeably different from before, as there were many signs of newfound politeness in his words.\n“Are soldiers going to be stationed here?”\n“Oh, no way. Don’t worry, we will evacuate as soon as the damage analysis is done.”\nNone of the officers could argue against Cho Yun, as they all felt the same way. They couldn’t help but marvel at the vice-chairman of the Yongchun, who had defeated the Demon King and subdued his army.\nThey were convinced that even the entire military wouldn’t be able to take him down.\n‘For a while, the world will be in Yongchun’s hands.’\nThe officers knew that this statement was undeniable and now understood why Ahn Woo-hong had signed an agreement with Yongchun Group on equal footing.\nTak!\nWhen Cho Yun motioned with his hand, an officer came up to him and presented him with a bag. Inside was a mobile device with a security system.\n“What’s this?”\n“\nAhem\n, this is a secure cell phone with a direct number to the office of the Jinan National Guard. If there are any problems with Gates or anything else, please feel free to call us here directly.”\nIt was an ambitious proposal with heavy implications, as the National Guard’s request would be no different than actively cooperating with Yongchun Group. Chun Yu-jang couldn’t hide his satisfaction.\n‘Thanks to my ancestor, everything is going smoothly.’\nHe believed that everything was possible because of Chun Yeowun, which was an undeniable fact.\nChun Yu-jang glanced at the site.\n‘What’s happening?’\nHe had approached Cho Yun to manage the situation but was now more curious about what was happening inside.\nInside the Yongchun Group site:\nAll the demons were gathered, including Grand Duke Kaliaf and the demons from Bamut prison who were enjoying their victory and the ones under the former Demon King who were now awaiting their disposal.\nThey all focused on the situation at hand, which would determine their fate.\n“The 10th Troop’s Commander, Marquis Poto, pledges eternal loyalty to the new Demon King.”\n“The 11th Troop’s commander, Marquis Oxod, pledges eternal loyalty to the new Demon King.”\nThe highest-ranking demons, the troop leaders, were pledging their allegiance to the new King, following an oath in their clan laws.\nNo matter how horribly they lived, they still were beings with respect, and they knew that the lack of a firmly-established system would shake the clan, which is why they did not hesitate to announce their loyalty.\n‘Hmm.’\nChun Yeowun watched them.\nIn reality, he didn’t care too much about such things and wanted to avoid them, but he knew that these allegiances would be necessary to control the demons.\n“The oath of allegiance of all the troop commanders is done, Your Majesty.”\nThe 1st Squad’s commander, Marquis Alchemir, spoke as their representative.\nAs a central figure in the Demon King’s army, he played a very significant role and had no idea that this result would come from his opening the Gate location to this destination.\nNow, his heart was beating heavily.\n“If our Lord wants to, couldn’t we conquer the entire China?”\nHu Bong spoke with a smile. However, Baekgi and the other demon commanders didn’t answer him. To be honest, their new King had unbelievable powers.\nEven the lowest demon could outperform humans at the Master level. In addition, the demons above the Count level were strong enough to beat all of the strongest humans.\n‘Conquering China? He could probably have the entire world in his hand.’\nWith his power, it really seemed possible; if Chun Yeowun was their King, then conquering the world wouldn’t just be a dream.\nThe Murim Association had also lost its control under the Sky Demon Order, which had an agreement with the Ministry of National Defense and now reigned over S-class Entity demons.\nChun Yeowun also had 2 SS-class Keepers on his side and a golden Gumiho that followed him around.\nHe definitely had the largest power on Earth.\n‘MS Group touched someone they shouldn't have.’\nCurrently, the only enemy Chun Yeowun had was the MS Group, which they felt terrible for at this point.\nChak!\nGrand Duke Kaliaf and Duke Joseph knelt. Their smiles didn’t leave their faces, as both of them were happy that Demon King Taura was dead and Larisha was back.\n“Your Majesty, please tell me what to do.”\nGrad Duke Kaliaf asked for Chun Yeowun’s following orders.\nThe question would determine the future of the demons and whether or not Chun Yeowun would come to the Demon Realm with them.\nChun Yeowun controlled all of the power now.\n“Hmm.”\nHe looked around, looking at the seven thousand demons there who didn’t have a place to stay.\n‘Unnecessary power.’\nChun Yeowun thought that all of them didn’t need to stay there, but Chun Yeowun was also someone who had to go back to his original timeline someday.\n‘And my absence will cause confusion.’\nChun Woo-jin and Chun Yu-jang weren’t skilled enough to control them, and the 7,000 demons were beyond what they could handle. Making a decision, Chun Yeowun said,\n“Kaliaf.”\n“Yes your Majesty!”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf lifted his head. However, Chun Yeowun’s following words were unexpected.\n“I appoint you as the next Demon King.”\n‘!!!’\nAll the demons who heard him were shocked. Just now, they were done pledging their allegiance to the new King, but he had suddenly announced that he would abdicate his throne?\n“Your Majesty, what do you mean?!”\nDuke Joseph was bewildered and asked Chun Yeowun.\n“It’s just as you heard. I said that Kaliaf would be the new Demon King.”\n“Why so sudden, Your Majesty?”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf, too, was perplexed by the words. The seat of the Demon King wasn’t something that could be given so easily to just anyone.\nIf he wanted to receive the throne, Kaliaf would have to convince the demons first and then fight the current King, but Chun Yeowun had defeated the former King.\nCould you just accept it under the law?\nTak!\nGrand Duke Kaliaf clasped his hands and pleaded,\n“Please take back your words, Your Majesty!”\n“Right, Your Majesty. No one in the clan can understand this.”\nDuke Joseph bowed as well.\nHe thought he had finally allowed Larisha to sit on the throne, but this new situation confused him.\nChun Yeowun looked at them and smiled,\n“You seem to be misunderstanding something.”\n“Huh?”\n“What do you mean?”\nHe continued.\n“I am in a position to take care of the Sky Demon Order and the clan, and cannot be tied to one place as a King.”\nAt those words, Grand Duke Kaliaf and Joseph were confused.\nFrom their point of view, humans on earth weren’t strong, but rather very weak.\nWas there any need to lead these trivial beings?\nChun Yeowun could feel their thoughts from their expressions.\n‘I won’t be able to control them if I leave them alone.’\nEven if they had sworn allegiance, the suppression of power acted on the most basic level.\nIf one doesn't have the strength to convince subordinates, they will never follow.\n‘I need to press them firmly.’\nWoong!\nIntense Sky Demon Energy radiated from Chun Yeowun’s body.\nDark energy was creeping and encroaching in every direction, stealing breaths from all of the demons.\nEven if that wasn’t enough, Chun Yeowun now also had the Demon King’s powers which had been absorbed and was unfathomably strong.\n‘Kuak.’\n‘Why…’\nThe suppressed demons couldn’t raise their heads.\nThis was the same for Grand Duke Kaliaf and Duke Joseph.\nChun Yeowun spoke in a firm voice and used internal energy so that everyone could hear him.\n“I am the Demon God, a being who reigns above the King.”\nHis voice rang in the demon's ears and stimulated them, which was one of the Demon King’s abilities.\nIt was the power to overpower and suppress every demon with lower power than him, and Chun Yeowun was twice as strong than the former Demon King, so every demon was afraid.\nChun Yeowun approached Grand Duke Kaliaf and Duke Joseph.\n“Who am I?”\n“Y-Your Majesty…”\n“I am not a King. I’ll ask again, who am I?”\nGrand Duke Kaliaf struggled to open his mouth at the overbearing force.\n“T-The Great Demon God.”\n“I am someone who reigns above the King.”\nChun Yeowun was making sure they all knew that he was someone higher than the Demon King.\nChun Yeowun looked at the commanders and asked,\n“Has it been engraved who I am?”\nThe commanders, suppressed by the overbearing power, responded with immense difficulty.\n“Demon God.”\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun, who heard their answer, called back his energy as all of the previous suppressed demons let out a rough breath.\nEven Grand Duke Kaliaf looked pale.\nChun Yeowun clearly made his statement.\n‘He isn’t someone we can wield recklessly.’\nGrand Duke Kaliaf didn’t want to incur the wrath of Chun Yeowun, who was a monster strong enough to annihilate all the demons.\nSmiling, Chun Yeowun said,\n“I give you the throne. Rule the demons, Kaliaf.”\nGulp!\nGrand Duke Kaliaf now answered.\n“I will follow the command of the Demon God.”\nDespite the role of Demon King being given away, Chun Yeowun still held the real power.\nIt was as if he were wielding a King.\nThe commanders, Duke, and Grand Duke were aware of this, but they couldn’t complain.\n‘Enough. Should I just send them now?’\nChun Yeowun decided to send them back but still looked around, thinking about whether or not it would be beneficial to keep the demons with useful powers with him.\n‘Wait… they can handle the gates at their will. Wouldn’t it then be possible to control the Gates on Earth too?’\nBecause of the Gates that opened randomly, Earth suffered greatly from the invasions.\nHowever, there was now a clue to controlling them.",

      "content": "Chapter 216: The Clues to Change (2)\nThe lower body armor of Arisha can transform into 12 daggers and has the ability called Control, which can restrain an opponent and allow the user to control them.\nThe next day, a meeting was held in the conference room in Yongchun Group. In the room, a 3D image of Earth was displayed.\nThe people gathering in the conference room were the executives of the Yongchun Group, the five demon commanders, Duke Joseph, and Chun Yeowun with his subordinates.\nAfter the unfathomable battle, most of the demons returned to the Demon Realm. Of course, not everyone was sent back as Chun Yeowun selected 300 demons with powers that couldn't be ignored to remain on Earth.\nTak!\nMarquis Alchemir, the commander of the 1st squad, operated the 3D machine and showed six positions of the Earth.\nPointing at them, he said,\n“These points are the\nbackbone\nof the Star-Road that exists on Earth.”\n“Star-Road?”\nChun Woo-jin asked with a puzzled expression.\n“The Star-Road is the path which exists between the planets.”\nMarquis Alchemir gave a simple definition. However, it still wasn’t enough for people who heard it for the first time.\n“Between planets?”\n“Haa. I think I should explain from the start.”\nMarquis Alchemir rubbed his forehead while showing a troubled expression. Despite significant advancements in human science, there were still so many unknowns. Moreover, the same was true for the Gates that were opened.\nTatak!\nAfter Marquis Alchemir pressed another button, the image changed to a universe filled with stars.\n“The universe is vast. Planets are places where living things settle in the universe. Since the beginning, these planets have had a way to interact with other planets. That is Star-Road.”\nStar-Road.\nIt meant the passage between planets.\n“Are all planets the same?”\nMarquis Alchemir answered Chun Yeowun’s question.\n“Yes, Demon God. We don’t know why it came into existence, but there is certainly a passage between planets.”\nEveryone nodded their heads because it was not a tricky thing to understand.\nTurning back to the image of the Earth, Marquis Alchemir continued.\n“What you see now is the\ncore\nof the Star-Road.”\n“What is a core?”\n“It is the heart of the Star-Road which opens and closes.”\n“Can you open and close it?”\n“Each planet has its own system that protects the planet itself from external influence by Star-Road. If something goes wrong with the center….”\n“The same thing as this happens?”\n“… yes.”\nSomething like today.\nIt means that the Gates on the Earth are opened.\nAnd now, as everyone was rushing to block the Gate, he couldn't figure out why this was happening.\nHuan Myung-oh said in a trembling voice,\n“Well, if we solve the problem with the\ncore\nor\nheart\n, will we be able to prevent the Gate incidents?”\n“At least we can prevent unintentional openings.”\nWhoop!\nAt those words, people could not hide their shock.\nTo say they can solve the Gate that has put humankind into a cage…\nAs everyone was expressing their joy, Chun Yeowun asked.\n“You said the planet has its own protection system, but there are cases where problems arise arbitrarily?”\n“Ah!”\nEveryone was focused on those words. As Marquis Alchemir said, there was no way that the self-protection system would have broken.\nMarquis Alchemir took a deep breath and answered.\n“The planet’s own protection was robust. It cannot be broken unless you force it into a shock.”\n“So, someone broke it?”\nChun Yu-jang asked with a frown, and Marquis Alchemir just responded with a nod.\n“No way…”\n“All of this….”\nEveryone in the room was stunned by the revelation. The Gate was no less than a natural disaster for humankind.\nIt was natural for them to be shocked to learn the truth that such a disaster was forced by someone. Thoughts ran in their heads, and their shock turned to anger.\n“What kind of things would make it happen?!”\n“How horrible!”\nEven the number of people who died due to the Gate was complex. The reality is that many misfortunes were caused by this. They wondered what kind of person or being could want to end humanity.\n“That is what I know….”\nJust because he knew the Gate well did not mean he knew who was behind the incident. It was the same with the other demon commanders.\nHowever, some people had different reactions. It was Duke Joseph. Chun Yeowun, who noticed it, asked.\n“Duke Joseph.”\n“Ah! Demon God.”\n“You seem to know something?”\nHe hesitated and then said, as if unsure of something.\n“Why?”\nDuke Joseph, who was hesitant about the question, opened his mouth.\n“The last time I visited Earth, the Gates did not open arbitrarily. Do you know when this started?”\n“28 years ago.”\nChun Woo-jin was the one who answered it.\nNot just him but the members of the Sky Demon Order could not forget it.\nThe First Dimension Gate.\nIt was the worst tragedy in history that occurred due to the simultaneous opening of Gates.\n“28 years back? Hm… it could only be your beliefs.”\n“You mean it isn’t that?”\n“It seems to be a little different from what I know.”\n“Different? What do you mean?”\n“If they forcibly damage the Star-Road’s core, this planet should be under control by now, but it doesn’t seem like it.”\n“Control?”\nWhen everyone was puzzled, Duke Joseph shook his head and said,\n“I know of a similar thing. If they did damage it, the Earth would have been worshiping the Heaven clan by now.”\nAt the word Heaven, Chun Yeowun remembered something.\n“Heaven Clan? Are you talking about Talisha’s clan?”\n“Yes.”\nThe rest of the demons started to get interested in the topic.\n‘Heaven clan?’\n‘Talisha’s clan was involved?’\nTalisha was their lifelong nemesis, and it seemed like Duke Joseph had different information from what they knew.\n“Talisha clan was a clan called Heaven. Unlike our clan who enjoy the pure warlike nature, they are a clan who liked to rule and be worshiped.”\n“They have a desire to conquer.”\n“Among all the living things, there is no one without the desire to conquer. But they are happy to be worshiped.”\n“Perverts, maybe? It makes them feel happy.”\nHu Bong clicked his tongue and shook his head.\nDuke Joseph smiled and continued.\n“It is no surprise when you visit the area they have conquered. They have created sculptures and constructed temples to worship them as gods.”\n“Funny people.”\n“Their methods are the same. Open the Gates to the planet, cause a crisis, and then come over and help, which makes people worship them.”\n“They solve it?”\n“It is to showcase their power. Such disgusting beings.”\nDuke Joseph said in a voice of contempt. In the case of demons, they do not treat the weaker ones more than bugs.\nOn the other hand, the Heaven clan wants them to be worshiped by the weaker race. They had opposing ideas.\n‘However, neither is desirable.’\nChun Yeowun did not speak out. If not for him, even the demons would be harmful to humans.\n“Anyway, it can’t be them.”\n“It seems like it. If it were them, they would not leave the Gates open this long and attempt to block the path of the sky and seal off the planet’s source of power and then suppress the humans with fear, and after that….”\n“Wait…!”\nHuan Myung-oh suddenly stopped him from speaking.\n“What do you mean by blocking the path of the sky?”\n“There are differences in technology between planets, but air transport is at the heart of the advanced civilizations. Controlling the air movements makes people weak.”\nHuan Myung-oh realized\nsomething\nafter hearing what Duke Joseph stated.\nAir transport is an area occupied by the large military; it was tightly controlled, resulting in people losing half of their power.\n“Why did you ask that, Huan Myung-oh?”\n“L-Lord Chun Ma, can I ask another thing?”\nDirector Huan Myung-oh asked solemnly, and Chun Yeowun agreed with a nod.\n“Here. So, what does it mean to shut off the source of the power of living things?”\n“Looks like you are interested. Human. It is simple. If you were to invade with an army, what strategy would you take?”\n“Strategy?”\n“It is to block the greatest power the opponent has. They will become vulnerable if you cut off their energy or eliminate their power source.”\nDuke Joseph spoke naturally.\nHuan Myung-oh was shocked after hearing that. Looking at Huan Myung-oh, Chun Yeowun was puzzled as he tried to speak. However, before he could say anything, Huan Myung-oh said a word.\n“NFIJ…”\n“NFIJ? What is it?”\n“A fission-neutralizing jammer.”\nThe moment he heard it, one of the information Nano had gathered in his mind popped into Chun Yeowun’s thought.\nNuclear Fission Incapacitation Jammer.\nA device to neutralize nuclear fission.\nShortly after the Gate opened, humankind was unable to engage in it, cutting off the smooth supply and demand of energy and making it impossible to use the nuclear bomb, humanity’s greatest weapon.\nThe monsters and their cores came out of the Gate, which replaced the supply and demand of earth’s energy.\n“Ah!”\nWhen this came to mind, Chun Yeowun understood why Huan Myun-oh reacted like this.\nWith a trembling voice, Huan Myung-oh said,\n“Lord. It seems like this was truly done by the Heaven clan.”\nDuke Joseph frowned.\n“What do you mean, human?”\n“It is as you said.”\n“As I said?”\n“Earth has lost its nuclear weapons and airways due to the TRAs that have been up in each region.”\n“Huhu.”\nWhen they heard what Director Huan Myung-oh had stated, the commanders of the Sky Demon Order stiffened up. They, too, were aware of nuclear fission and the blockage of the airways. However, they did not think it would turn out like this.\nDuke Joseph mumbled.\n“But… why did the Talisha’s clan leave you alone then?”\nIf what they were saying was true, Talisha’s clan brought the optimal situation they wanted.\nIf so, Earth should have fallen into their hands.\nA heavy atmosphere was filled in the room because of shocking truths.\nThen Chun Yeowun said,\n“The bottom line is that Talisha’s clan is responsible for this situation, and isn’t it possible to close the Gate by restoring the core of Star-Road?”\n“Right. Demon God.”\nChun Yeowun stood up at Duke Joseph’s answer.\n“Then we have work to do.”\n“Huh?”\n“We must close the Gate and wipe out Talisha’s clan.”\nChun Yeowun concluded.\nIn a massive chamber in some unknown place, more than 300 glass tubes were filled with red liquid and beings that looked like humans.\nA computer monitor screen was attached at the top of the glass tubes and displayed for adjustments.\nStep!\nThe steps of someone walking in can be heard.\nIt was Elder Cho. He passed through the glass tubes and reached the main computer.\nWheing!\nAmong the multiple monitors connected to the main one, the largest monitor containing someone's rendered image was viewed.\nIt was a person with the letter\nA\non the gold mask.\nA voice came from the speaker, breaking the chamber’s silence.\n— 1st Guest.\nTo which Elder Cho answered with an expressionless face.\n“It is just us two. Don’t call me that.”\n— I get it, Elder Cho.\n“What is the progress of the project?”\n— The process is running smoothly. About 8% of the composition is done. Soon, after we upload the whole brain, we will succeed and will be able to move directly.\n“That is nice to hear.”\n— What about the results?\nElder Cho—\nno\n, Cho Yu-shin, looked at the tubes at\nMask\nA\n's question.\n“I went to pick it up. Can we use them?”\n— The adjustment is made. Class C entities can simply upload any information at any time—\n“Wait.”\n— What is it?\nMask A\nseemed puzzled. At that, Cho Yu-shin smiled.\n“A rat infiltrated.”\nShhh!\nWith that, Cho Yu-shin turned towards the ventilation at the ceiling. It was about 500 meters away.\nThe moment he looked up, the person hiding in the vent was shocked.\n‘Damn it!’\nThe black-masked person mumbled. He tried to escape fast while bewilderedly thinking about how he was noticed.\nHaving learned the Silent Walking Art, he was a master in stealth, so he didn’t think he would be found so easily.\nHowever…\nKwang!\n“\nKuak!\n”\nHis body was pulled down and fell to the ground at the strong pull of the internal energy. He attempted to get up as soon as he fell, but he couldn't.\nShh!\nCho Yu-shin stepped on his head.\n“\nKuak!\n”\n“Rat.”\nCho Yu-shin looked down at the man and took off his mask.\nWheik!\nThere was something on him.\nA red dot flashed.\n“A tracker?”\nCho Yu-shin threw the tracker away, and something like a mechanical hand jumped out of the floor and grabbed the terminal.\n“Block it.”\n— I will.\nMask A\nanswered from the speaker, and Cho Yu-shin leaned over and touched the mask.\nThe man bit his tongue, but the massive internal energy grabbed him by the chin.\nShhh!\nCho Yu-shin held the infiltrator’s chin and leveled the man’s eyes near his abdomen.\nClosing his eyes, he mumbled,\n“Huhu~ you people. Blade God Six Martial clan.”\n‘!?’\nHearing those words, the man’s eyes shook. Just by touching the body, this person could tell his clan.\nLooking at him being flustered, Cho Yu-shin smiled.\n“I need to clean this up.”\nAngel’s Notes\nSelf-Protection System – a planet’s protection from external influence.Talisha’s clan – is also known as the Heaven clan.

      "content": "Chapter 217: TRA Alpha Satellite (1)\nThere was a vast, barren desert.\nThis situation occurred because the land was abandoned and dried up over time; in the past, this area had been filled with trees and livestock.\nHowever, contamination was became a very serious issue, causing the land to become abandoned and ruined over time.\nThud! Thud!\nOriginally, the area was outside the wall, so no one would have even thought of entering this place, but there were footsteps of people there.\nThere were as many as five hundred men in protective suits like those worn by the army.\nBeep!\n“Huh?”\nA man in a suit, carrying a communication equipment bag, seemed shocked by something.\nIn response, the man next to him who had a large sword asked,\n“What is it?”\n“The tracking signal was blocked.”\n“What, in just 30 seconds?”\n“Yes, Blade master.”\nHe seemed to be one of the top six masters of Blade Six, Gu Cheong-sa.\nHe was comparable to Marayun, the Wind God of the Sky Demon Order.\nUnable to understand he asked,\n“Didn’t we get a signal that he was entering the enemy camp?”\n“Yes.”\n“And it got cut right after 30 seconds of entering that place?”\n“Probably…”\nThe man in a suit that was using the communication device couldn’t give a straight answer, as the evidence meant that their comrade was shortly caught after entering the enemy’s lair.\n“Shit!”\nGu Cheong-sa was confused. Just moments ago, they were happy that the enemy camp had been found.\n“Was the last location saved?”\n“Yes, the location has been confirmed about 5 kilometers from here.”\nThe place was pinpointed in the middle of the barren desert where there were stony mountains.\n“For now, send the location information back to headquarters and the others, and we can then advance from here.”\n“Huh? Aren’t we going to wait?”\n“What if they notice our movement?”\n“Ah, I see.”\nListening to Gu Cheong-sa words, the man with the communication device tapped something on the tablet as Gu Cheon-sa raised his hand and shouted,\n“Advance!”\n“Yes!!!”\nAt the moment they were about to begin their march,\nSwoosh!\nCreepy!\nGu Cheong-sa looked up in shock and saw something that looked like a dot to him in the distance.\nSeeing the point, he decided to use his senses to examine it…\n‘Everyone move out!”\n“Y-yes!”\nAs soon as he gave the new orders, everyone tried to spread out, but the approaching dot continued to fall towards them quickly.\nBang!\nPapapak!\nSomething fell right in the middle of, causing a huge shockwave and sending back dozens of Blade Clan members.\n“Kuak!”\n“Ack!”\nMany of the members were thrown back by the impact, while the closest members were cut down by something sharp that stained the place with blood.\nEven the dust in the air seemed to turn into blood.\nChachang!\nThe Blade God Six Martial clan members drew their swords at once. With tense eyes, they looked at what had flown right in the middle of their group. When the bloody dust finally passed, a man behind a red mask was revealed.\n“Mask?”\nGrunt\n.\nGu Cheong-sa ground his teeth at the unpleasant memories that came up from seeing the mask, which reminded him of his fight with Mararyun.\nHe had fought with his all, but towards the end of the battle, he lost his left eye because of Marayun.\n“\nTsk\n. I hate masked bastards.”\nSrng!\nHe steadily wielded the huge blade on his back.\nThe gigantic blade, which seemed to be 1.6 meters in length, was a sign of the Six masters that only he could handle.\nOriginally, he had wanted to fight Wang Shin of the Sky Demon Order, but wasn’t given the opportunity to.\n“Who is that monster?’\nTHe man to Gu Cheong-sa’s right was trembling.\nA weird, unknown feeling of anxiety began to creep into him. Only when he got scared did it mean that things were turning horrible.\nGu Cheong-sa shouted,\n“Strong Blade Unit, move!”\nThe unit took the formation known as the Extreme Blade Circle, which was made solely for the sake of dealing with Chun Yeowun.\nIt was a large-scale attack that used three hundred people and had the power to even dismantle an S-class Alpha Entity in less than 5 minutes.\n“Yes!!!”\nAs soon as the order fell, the Blade Six members began to besiege the unknown man in mask with their circle formation.\nAt that time, the man in the mask tried to lift his sword.\n“Hey!!”\nTo prevent him from doing anything, Gu cheong-sa jumped in with lightning-like movements and slashed his blade.\nThe force from the blade’s strike seemed like it could cut down small mountains, but,\nTak!\n“N-No way…”\nGu Cheong-sa couldn't hide his shock. The man in the red mask had grabbed his giant blade with just two fingers as if he was grabbing a piece of paper. Even the other members of the Blade Six clan were shocked.\n“T-The Blade of a Blade Master?”\n“With just two fingers?”\nThey were surprised, but a voice suddenly rang out from the masked man.\n“A lot of you rats have gathered. It’ll take some time to sort all of this out, so don’t be upset if this old man can’t give all of you the same attention.”\n“What?”\nThe voice behind the mask seemed young, yet he called himself old?\nThen,\nGoo!\nAn unbelievable and terrifying energy rose from the masked man, and the surrounding gravity seemed to disappear.\n“Ugh!”\n“M-My body!”\n“Ack!”\nThe bodies of the people around began to float up in the air; the sight of hundreds of people rising up made goosebumps rise.\nThe members of the Blade Six clan tried to raise their internal energy, but nothing happened.\n“You!”\nGu Cheong-sa tried to move his caught blade, but,\nPak!\n“Huh?!”\nAs soon as the blade left the fingers of the masked man, Gu Cheong-sa’s body rose up. As if he was in a zero gravity state, Gu Cheong-sa began to float and panicked. trying to use Air Blades but missed.\n“Hah!”\nSwoosh!\nThree Air Blades with blue energy flew for the man, but the outcome was absurd.\nWheik!\n“H-huh?!”\nThe flying blades turned to the opposite direction and flew for Gu Cheong-sa.\nPuak!\n“Kuaaak!”\n“Blade Master!”\nThe blades pierced his chest, abdomen, and thighs at the same time, and since the major parts of his body were pierced, Gu Cheong-sa felt like he was going die a horrible and painful death.\n‘H-How can such a monster be alive?’\nLifting so many people up wasn’t enough for the man, so he even used Air Blades to control Gu Cheong-sa.\nThis monster was unbelievable.\nAt that moment, the red-masked man raised his hand and mumbled,\n“Hahah, it has been so long since I’ve used this: Bloodshed.”\nAs soon as he finished saying that, something terrible happened.\nPapapak!\nDozens of clan members' bodies exploded. As if the explosions had happened inside their bodies, blood splattered everywhere.\n“W-what is…”\nAt the sight of living people exploding and dying, Gu Cheong-sa’s eyes lit up with despair, as he knew that this was just the beginning.\nPapapak!\nThe explosions happened as if a wave of fire was consuming the bodies from the bottom up. From a distance, it seemed like purple blood was gushing up, a terrifying sight. And Gu Cheong-sa was no exception to it.\n“Ackkkk!”\nHe tried to hold it down, but the blood all over his body vibrated and his eyes swelled and body exploded.\nChachacha!\nThe rain of blood of four hundred or so men filled the scene. The man in the red mask had stopped the fight with just internal energy and finally took off the mask once everyone was done . enjoying the rain of blood.\n“I haven’t felt the taste of blood in a long. Huhuhu!”\nThe smiling man was Cho Yu-shin. The appearance of him enjoying the bloody rain made him look like devil of madness.\nCho Yu-shin, who was drenched in blood, turned his head and mumbled.\n“I need to clean up the other rats.”\nPath!\nHis new form soared into the blood colored sky.\nBlade Six’s hideout in Chengdu.\nThere, an old man with scars all over his body, Hwang Heol, and Geum Seong-Ryong, the chairman looked at each other with still faces.\nWhat did they just hear?\nWith a trembling voice, Geum Seong-ryong asked a man in a black suit,\n“Were they annihilated?”\n“Y-yes.”\n“How could that…”\nTheir huge force consisting of 1,500 people was wiped out.\nThe force had contained two Supreme Master level warriors and three of the Six Masters had reached the Superior Master level.\nHowever, they were all killed not long after the message that the enemy camp was found had reached headquarters.\nHwnag-heol opened his mouth,\n“Any information about the enemy?”\n“Ah, that… the location information was deleted on the way.”\n“What? Deleted?”\n“While the information was being uploaded, our system was hacked through the network. We had to destroy the computer to avoid being traced, so we lost the information as well.”\nCrack!\nHwang Heol’s chair handle broke. He thought that he had finally managed to touch the MS Group, but instead provided them with an excuse to go after his clan.\nAt this rate, it was only a matter of time before they arrived at his location.\n“Elder.”\nWith a worried face Geum Seong-ryong called for Hwang-heol face, whose face hardened as he said,\n“Contact him.”\n“You mean…?”\n“Demon God.”\nBang! Bang!\nMany people at the bar were drinking noisily.\nBi Mak-heon, who was under the vice-chairman, blocked one ear as he answered a call.\n“Yes, this is Bi Mak-heon. Ah.. Chairman Geum.”\nBi Mak-heon was puzzled by the unexpected call. Although they did exchange information, he never thought the chairman would contact him.\n“Ah, vice-chairman?”\nThe chairman wanted to speak to Chun Yeowun.\nIn response, Bi Mak-heon looked at the sky with a puzzled expression.\n“It might be difficult at the moment.”\nChun Yeowun wasn’t in a position to answer the call.\n“Huh? Is he in the middle of something important?”\nThe chairman’s voice did seem unusual; Bi Mak-heon thought it was strange.\nNonetheless, getting hold of Chun Yeowun would be difficult.\n“I am sorry, but I can’t say for sure when you can speak to the vice-chairman.”\nAt that moment, a shout came from the call.\n“I said it is urgent! Why the hell aren’t you even trying to listen!”\n“Um…”\nBi Mak-heon scratched his head with a troubled expression, looking at the sky. It would have been great if he had the words to explain it.\nSeeing countless flashes lit up the sky, Bi Mak-heon said,\n“The vice-chairman is now leaving the Earth.”\n“What?”\nIn an embarrassed voice, Bi Mak-heon narrowed his head and continued,\n“Roughly, he seems to have gone past the stratosphere.”\n“!?”\nAbout 50km from the sky, there were dozens of explosions. In the mist of the explosions, Bi Mak-heon could see something flying through the sky at a tremendous speed.\nSwoosh! Papak!\nSomeone pierced through the layers of air and soared high, causing explosions to erupt midair.\nWith a black suit of steel and white particles in his eyes, Chun Yeowun heard Nano’s voice in one ear as he flew through the sky.\n[Crossed the mid-range point: 55 kilometers.]\nBeep! Beep!\nNumerous red crosses were highlighted in the Nanosuit’s field of vision.\nYellow rays of light were fired ahead.\n[17 beams approaching directly.]\nSwoosh!\nChun Yeowun stretched out his hand.\n‘Nano, assist.’\n[Panel system operation.]\nWoong!\nBlack Invisible Swords scattered around Chun Yeowun, controlled by Nano’s panel system. Chun Yeowun clasped his hand.\nPaaang!\nBlack beams came out from the black Invisible Swords and flew towards the yellow beams that were flying towards him.\nKwakwang!\nAs the beams collided, the air was filled with a flash and sound of the explosion, which was a sight to see from the ground.\n‘Speed up, Nano.’\n[Increasing speed to Mach 13.]\nWith that, Chun Yeowun’s speed increased even more.\nPapak!\nA small fox with nine tails could be seen hanging on the back of the Nanosuit: it was none other than the golden Gumiho. She was making a horrible face as her hair was moving back and her mouth and eyes as well at the speed.\n“Ahhh! T-too fast!”\nMach 13 was a tremendous speed that even the Gumiho couldn’t handle.\n“I told you not to stick onto me.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, the Gumiho said,\n“I-I, too, want to see the universe!”",

      "content": "Chapter 218: TRA Alpha Satellite (2)\nAngel’s Note\nBefore starting the chapter, here’s an image of the Earth’s atmosphere from NASA! I had thought you might need a refresher. Hihi. ?? (Just in case some of you need it because I did.)\nSelf Healing is one of Chun Yeowun’s abilities that automatically heals any injuries or wounds dealt to his body, prevents him from being poisoned and extracts the poison out of his body, and prevents him from being drunk or being put in an illusion.\nSomeone was flying in the sky, going above the Earth. The higher he went above, the more frequent the light flashed.\nThere were a lot of hurdles as he flew up. Amid those hurdles, Chun Yeowun was flying fast.\nThe conversation from the night before resurfaced in Chun Yeowun's mind.\n[If you want to enter the Star-Road, you have things that must be done first.]\n[What is that?]\n[You need to deal with the object controlling the sky in the satellite's orbit.]\nAt Duke Joseph’s words, Director Hwang Myung-oh said,\n[TRA!]\nIt referred to the Three Restricted Areas. The worst Alpha entity nestled in one of the TRAs was resolved by Chun Yeowun.\n[What does that mean?]\n[The area above us is included in the restricted area, my Lord.]\n[The sky?]\nOne of those areas restricted was none other than the sky. To be precise, it was the thermosphere1 where the satellite could orbit.\n[No, how are we going to get rid of it? We would have to fly higher than 500 kilometers from the Earth, regardless of whether the satellite should be.]\n[Huh.]\n[That would be impossible.]\nThe executives considered it impossible as it was already proven once before. Hundreds of satellites have been made by the nations on Earth to eliminate the dangerous entity located on the satellite.\nEven if a single aircraft attempted to enter the troposphere2, some strange rays would block it.\n[Lord Chun Ma! It is impossible. Even if we try, it would be tough to have a rocket enter that place.]\n[This is why humans are like this.]\nDuke Joseph and the commanders laughed at them.\nChun Woo-jin, who didn’t like the demons’ reaction, asked,\n[Then, can you?]\n[It will take some risk, but it can be done.]\n[To get into the satellite orbit?]\nDuke Joseph and the commanders seemed confident. They had the technology to handle the gate; how could there be no technology to advance into space?\nLooking at them being confident, Chun Yeowun said,\n[Then it’s simple. Did you say that the entities are six?]\n[Yes.]\n[We proceed at once.]\n[Uh?]\n[Duke Joseph, command the commanders and take down the five entities. I will remove one.]\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, the sect members were puzzled.\nDemons aren’t humans, so they could try this. But Chun Yeowun was a human and a martial artist; no matter how good he was, could he really touch the satellite orbit?\nThen, their curiosity was answered.\nSwoosh!\nThe vision of Chun Yeowun’s blacking rays turned blurry for a moment due to the use of unification of abilities with the Invisible Sword containing the Sky Demon Energy.\n[Freezing. The current temperature is -100C.]\nChun Yeowun was flying at the height of 70 kilometers above the mesosphere3. It was the coldest part of the atmosphere. It was difficult to get warmth from the earth and solar heat from the sun since it was so far from the ground.\n[Relieving the freezing.]\nPapak!\nHeat dissipated from Nano, and the freezing was cleared.\nChun Yeowun was worried about the Golden Gumiho hanging outside his suit.\n“Hey, fox?”\n— I’mmmm….Ffffff-Fine.\nFortunately, she seemed fine. She couldn’t get used to the speed of sound, not the temperature.\nShe was a yokai beast, so this must be nothing.\n“It will turn challenging to breathe. Will you be fine?”\n— A-aare you worried about me?\nDespite not being able to close her eyes right, the fox asked excitedly. To which Chun Yeowun just shook his head.\nRight now, this beast indeed looked like one.\n— Tch.\n“If you can’t stand me, go down.”\nHe thought she could actually descend to the ground alone.\nWith that, the Golden Gumiho answered.\n— I can survive three days and nights in the deep sea without oxygen.\nThe Golden Gumiho could accumulate oxygen in her body. However, adapting to the thermosphere might be difficult as soon as the friction index disappears.\n“You are so stubborn.”\n— Huh. Still, two people going to the space like—\n“Seeing how you speak, you must have adapted to the speed.”\n— ???\n“I will increase the speed.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, the Golden Gumiho was terrified.\n— Wait! Wait!\nAhhhhhhh!\nShe tried to tell him to stop, but the speed was already enhanced as Chun Yeowun now moved at Mach4 14.\nOf course, it was the nano suit that helped him.\nA satellite low-orbit point at an altitude of 100 kilometers.\nIt was a place where the stars could be seen along with the round Earth.\nIt was an optimal point to see the place. The situation at the low-orbit point of the satellite was something that humans couldn’t even see.\nNumerous mechanical fragments were all over the place. These shattered fragments were space debris created by the destruction of hundreds of satellites and space stations, something of the past.\nGoo!\nNumerous beams of light were fired from the cracks of such things. As if looking down at the situation, spheres were arranged in a row, constantly aiming for something. A massive fortress in the shape of a ship stood in the center of the spot where the light spheres were connected.\nEarth’s name for this was the TRA Alpha Satellite.\nIt was a strategic weapon entity beyond the Gate that stole the sky from humans.\nPshhh!\nThere was a massive ship that acted as the head.\nIt was some dangerous entity for humans who had never approached it till this point. However, there was a big secret there.\nInside that ship were intelligent, four-armed beings twice the size of humans.\n“BIHANGMULCHEGA DUUK BBALAJIGO ISUNIDA!”\n[The flying object is getting faster!]\nAn entity looking at the monitor shouted.\nAt that, a six blue-eyed entity which seemed like the Captain said,\n“AJICKDO GYOCHU SIKIJI MOHEDAGO?”\n[It wasn’t shot down yet?]\n“GU....GURUSUMNIDA.”\n[W-we did.]\n“KUK. DARUNGOSUN?”\n[Shit! How about the others?]\n“GUJJOCKDO. DASU BIHANG MULCHEDULGYA GYOJEON JUNIMNIDA!”\n[They are also engaging the other multiple flying objects!]\nThey were conversing in a language that didn’t belong to Earth. They were beings with technology enough to occupy the space above a planet.\n“What is the situation of each orbit?”5\nPik!\nNumerous images were displayed on the ship's large monitor. There, satellite Alpha instance ships were seen in orbits of Earth.\nThe ships were using their beams to repel what was coming onto them.\nAt that moment, someone yelled.\n“Demon!”\nThe being who suddenly yelled had a different appearance from the others. It was a creature with an exotic appearance but a human in form. The only difference was the unique white wings on the back.\nThe Captain asked him.\n“Is that someone you know?”\n“Arisha’s clan.”\n“Ah!”\nAt the white-winged one's response, the Captain groaned. They knew that these were the nemesis of the white-winged ones who ruled them.\nThe identity of the white-winged ones was the Heaven clan or Talisha’s clan.\n“Are they going to intervene?”\nThe Heaven clan’s member licked their lips and mumbled while looking at the monitor, and then one of the other ones looking at the monitor suddenly yelled.\n“An unidentified object is approaching the satellite orbit!”\nPick!\nIt was being displayed on the large screen. They could see something black emitting a blue field and flying in at great speed.\n‘What is that?’\nThe Heaven clan member seemed puzzled. Since Arisha’s clan had been their enemy for a very long time, they knew everything about the clan’s technology.\nYet, they couldn’t figure out what this mysterious being was.\n‘Are they trying to mess with us?’\nUnlike other satellites, the sight of this single object seemed more like a threat. It felt like someone was messing with them.\nThe Heaven clan member spoke in an unpleasant voice.\n“Captain! Shoot him down quickly!”\nThe Captain with six eyes was flustered. Weren’t they also trying to shoot this one down?\nEven though they were shooting beams, this entity was blocking everything, and it was annoying.\n“Why aren’t you answering?”\n“… soon we will enter the area where the space junk is gathered. We will take care of it there.”\nThe area with space junk.\nIt is the place where the fragments of the artificial satellites were floating. It was a place where vision was obscured.\n“\nHuh\n! If something happens to us, Captain, you will be replaced.”\n“U-Understand.”\nAt the warning of the Heaven clan member, the Captain bit his lip.\nThey were all helpless in front of them.\n“Spawn the spacecraft.”\n“Yes!”\nAt the command of the Captain, the first officer turned on something that looked like a microphone and gave the order.\n“Prepare the craft to move.”\nWheing!\nFlight runways appeared in response to the shout; they were a quadrupedal machine, a spacecraft, and a combat vehicle that could walk freely in space.\nClank!\nDozens of spacecraft were hung upside down on each runaway in the hangar6. One of the monitors shouted.\n“Spacecraft ready to descend.”\nThe Captain shouted.\n“The target is an unidentified aircraft heading over here. Turn the space junk into a grave.”\n— Roger!\nThe subordinates shouted in unison.\nNumerous voices were heard from the monitor. There were more than 1,000 spacecraft.\n“Spacecraft, launch!”\nPapapak!\nThe moment the command fell, 1000 of them attached to the runway moved simultaneously.\nSwoosh!\nIt was spectacular to see them fly through the junk. The Heaven clan’s members nodded their heads, satisfied with their advance.\nThe Captain said in a confident voice,\n“It’s only one object. It won’t be able to get past the junk. Bring up the screens of each craft.”\n“Yes!”\nPik! Pik! Pik!\nThe view of those thousand ships was displayed on the ship's large screen. They were sharing the sight with the main ship.\nThey began to move into the debris to raid the entity as they descended.\nThen, the one monitoring shouted.\n“The flying object reached the 900-kilometer mark.”\n“… that is fast.”\nIt had already reached the space of debris.\nThe Captain grabbed the mic looking tensed, and ordered.\n“Entered the range. Each craft, be prepared for—-”\nThe voice came from one of the pilots.\n— C-Captain!\nPak!\nThe screen of the craft’s field of vision grew bigger. Numerous blue lights were caught on the camera. At first, it looked like a thousand—or maybe a hundred thousand lights shone.\n“W-what is…”\nThe Heaven clan member was also shocked. At that time, an uncountable number of blue lights rushed at once.\nPapapak!\nRays of blue light swept through the junk. The screams of pilots hiding in the debris could be heard through the speakers.\n— Kuak!\n— Ack!\nOn the screen, the view of the floating crafts changed to black.\nSeeing that, the Captain shouted.\n“W-what was that?”\n“Hundreds of thousands of thermal energy emanated from below.”\nAt the cry of the monitoring object, the Captain thought it was absurd.\n“W-what does that mean?”\nIt was absolutely incomprehensible.\nIt wasn’t like ships appeared, but where did the hundreds of thousands of sudden thermal energy come from?\nKwakwakwang!\nDue to the explosion, the vision was obscured. As the crafts and satellites exploded, nothing could be seen.\nThen the Heaven clan member said to the Captain,\n“Incompetent bastards! It will come to us!”\nThe flustered Captain tried to make up an excuse.\n“T-this is the first time we encountered something like this—”\n“Shut up.”\nThe Heaven clan member got up from the seat.\nOne of the monitoring entities shouted.\n“C-Captain!”\n“What is it?”\n“T-the screen!”\nThe Captain and the heaven clan looked at the monitor simultaneously. It wasn’t a low-altitude place.\nIt was the altitude above the ship.\nThe Heaven clan member coughed in anger.\n“W-what is this….”\nMany meteors were seen falling from a higher altitude from the ship’s location. Until recently, there was no such thing.\nWhen a meteor shower suddenly fell, it was chaos.\n“Reposition the mobile lasers to the rear!”\n“Rear barrier operation!”\nWheing!\nWeapons arranged to the left and right of the ship were usually made to keep the earth in check. If they couldn’t stop these meteors from ahead, they would also be taken down.\nThe Captain, who barely came to his senses, shouted.\n“F-fire the laser….”\nKwaang!\nAnd with a loud roar, the ship shook violently. The Captain, who was sitting on the chair, fell ahead.\n“W-what?”\nThe meteor didn’t even hit them. This shock was from below.\nKwakwakwang!\nSeries of explosions right under them. And the floor cracked open, and something appeared inside the cockpit.\nBang!\n‘!?’\nThe Heaven clan member looked at the Golden Gumiho and the man in a black suit. They thought it was an unidentified object, but this was a man.\n“I-Intruder!”\n“Catch him!”\nAs the ship shook, the entities inside had fallen down and tried to get up. However, the presence in a black suit lowered its hand.\nThud! Thud! Thud!\n“Kuak!”\n“Ack!”\nAll the entities inside were thrown to the floor without leaving one.\nBang!\n“\nUgh\n!”\nThe Heaven clan member tried to get up by holding the counter, but he couldn't hide his shock.\n‘W-what is that? Why is that monster in here?’\nThermosphere.\nLocated between 80 and 700 kilometers (50 and 440 miles) above Earth’s surface is the thermosphere, whose lowest part contains the ionosphere. In this layer, temperatures increase with altitude due to the very low density of molecules found here. It is both cloud- and water vapor-free. The aurora borealis and aurora australis are sometimes seen here. The International Space Station orbits in the thermosphere.

      "content": "Chapter 219: TRA Alpha Satellite (3)\nChun Yeowun’s expression changed while looking around.\nHe thought they were intelligent lifeforms, but the bizarre-looking beings looked like aliens.\nIt seemed like they were lifeforms from another planet. However, among them, there was one that resembled a human.\nStep!\nChun Yeowun approached the human-looking being, an entity from the Heaven clan, whose lower body was embedded in the ship. There were white wings on its back that interested Chun Yeowun, who hadn’t heard about them.\nIf the westerners saw them, they could consider this being an angel.\n[Compared to Earth, the oxygen distribution is 80% suitable. It is possible to breathe inside the ship.]\nAt Nano’s words, Chun Yeowun removed his helmet.\nShhh!\nThe suit’s helmet disassembled into his skin and the Heaven clan member couldn’t hide his surprise at Chun Yeowun’s appearance.\n“A human?”\nThe being would never even dream that this mysterious monster was a human.\n“How can a human have such power?”\nThe being couldn’t believe it. Chun Yeowun looked down at it and asked,\n“Are you a member of Talisha’s clan?”\n‘!?’\nThe winged being’s eyes seemed shocked by Chun Yeowun’s question. The only people who called its clan “Talisha’s clan” were those from Arisha’s clan.\nBy this term alone, it was certain that Chun Yeowun was related to the demons.\n“What is your relationship with\nthem\n, human?”\nChun Yeowun just stared at the being and lifted its hand.\nWoong!\n“Ack!”\nThe body of the Heaven clan member floated up, as if it was tied to a rope connected to the ceiling.\n“I ask the questions here.”\n‘What intimidation…’\nOne wrong step and he felt like he would die. However, those of the Heaven clan were known to have an overwhelming pride and sense of superiority, and this being was no different.\n“I have nothing to say to a human!”\n“So proud of yourself.”\n“How can a trivial human even think of—”\nTak!\nChun Yeowun grabbed the arm of the Heaven clan member, who was perplexed about Chun Yeowun’s next move.\n“What are you—”\nCrack!\n“Kuaaak!”\nBoth arms were torn off, resulting in a resounding scream. Blue blood instead of red flowed out from the torn ligaments.\nChun Yeowun’s eyes shone at the blood color.\n‘It’s different.’\nChun Yeowun thought that the Heaven clan member’s body structure would be similar to that of the demons, but despite having blood with a different color, the body seemed to have flowing blood, which resembled the body structure of humans more than that of the demons.\n“Kuaaaak!”\nThe Heaven clan member shouted as it suffered in pain.\n“There doesn’t seem to be much difference between someone so great and a human.”\n“Kuaak… you bastard.”\nThe Heaven clan member coughed in anger, but couldn't do a single thing as its body was still floating. Chun Yeowun asked,\n“Did someone from Talisha’s clan touch the Gates of Earth?”\nWhile asking, Chun Yeowun was actually already convinced that the perpetrator was someone from Talisha’s clan.\nAccording to Duke Joseph, those from Talisha’s clan would often manipulate Gates to rule the corresponding planets.\n“Y-You think I would answer a human’s questions?”\nThe prideful being decided to not speak, but based on the being’s trembling eyes, it seemed like Chun Yeowun’s assumption was correct.\n‘It has to be.’\nIt was evident that Talisha’s clan had touched the core of the Star-Road, but it wasn’t clear why they were watching the planet after doing so. Chun Yeowun then asked,\n“If you want to be respected and worshiped so much, then why did you leave the Gate open?”\nHe dove right into the main topic; he had to know their real intentions.\n‘What the hell is with him? Did Arisha’s clan team up with humans?’\nAs sensitive topics were being brought up, the Heaven clan member’s eyes were complicated. Seeing that the intruder knew so much about the way that the Heaven clan ruled over others, it was clear that the intruder had something to do with demons.\n‘I shouldn’t hand over any information.’\nThe foreign being clenched, believing that information would not be leaked, even at the cost of its own life.\nPuck!\nChun Yeowun’s fingers dug into its chest.\n“Kuaaak!”\n“Let’s test how long you decide not to speak.”\n“Kuaaak, Ki-kill me!”\nThe being shouted with its eyes open. Chun Yeowun liked those who stayed silent for the sake of loyalty to their clans, but this situation was an exception.\n“Really?”\nCrack!\nChun Yeowun’s fingers dug further into the chest to see if there was something like a nucleus in the chest like that of the demons\nHowever,\n‘Huh?’\nChun Yeowun frowned at what he felt. He could definitely feel beating in the being’s chest, but unlike the core of the demons, it was nothing more than an organ that circulated blood.\n“Huh?!”\nThe being smiled with a contorted face.\n“You don’t know us too well.”\n“What?”\n“Sadly. I can’t keep you alive, as you will bring disaster to our clan.”\nThe eyes of the being turned evil.\nA weird malice told him that something was being hidden and he shouted.\n“DILITO HAMSUN JAPOCK SEQUENCE GADONG!”\n[Delete ship! Self-destruct sequence activate!]\nAs soon as the words were spoken, the cockpit machine began to spark.\nCrackle!\nThe temperature in the cockpit rose and the being smiled. Although its clan regarded others as insignificant, they still learned the native language while staying there. (The foreign language belonged to the alien-looking beings that were under the Heaven clan’s control.)\nThe ship they were on flew through space spanning hundreds of millions of light years. When the main energy center that was equipped to operate the warp exploded, a nuclear explosion would follow.\nThe being laughed and said to Chun Yeowun,\n“Kuakuku, you are done for. You’ll die with me—”\nShhh!\nBefore he could even finish his words, his vision changed.\nAfter a moment of confusion, the Heaven clan member couldn’t hide their confusion at the clean air, which was different from the characteristic smell that should have come from his order.\n‘!?’\nA blue sky could be seen and many presences around could be felt.\n“Lord!”\n“Chun Ma!”\nAll the voices called for Chun Yeowun, which was when the being realized that it was no longer on the ship.\nKwang!\nA white light appeared in the sky as an explosion sounded and a fierce pressure was exerted across the ground. The explosion took place at an altitude of about 100 kilometers, but it still looked powerful.\n“Well… you failed.”\nChun Yeowun said, looking down at the being.\n‘D-Damn it! He could move through space?!’\nSuddenly, the eyes of the Heaven clan member were dyed with despair. The self-destruct in which it prepared to give up its life had ended in vain.\n“Now, will you talk about why your clan has stayed silent until now?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s question, the being licked its lips. It was impossible to divulge any information even though its plan had gone wrong; it had to keep the clan’s secret at the risk of its own life.\n“Funny bastard! You will get nothing from me!”\nCrack!\nA while light gleamed in the Heaven clan member’s eyes; it was trying to kill itself using heavenly power. At that moment, Chun Yeowun grabbed its head.\nIn response, the being’s eyes fluttered.\nUnlike the demons, the main part of the Heaven clan members was their head.\nAn immense amount of energy was concentrated at the head to commit suicide, which Chun Yeowun noticed.\nShhh!\nA gloomy blue energy then flowed from Chun Yeowun’s hand.\n‘If my prediction is right...’\nChun Yeowun concentrated.\n‘W-what is this?\n’\nThe heaven’s member was shocked at the gloomy energy that came from Chun Yeowun, and the question was soon answered.\nJjkkk!\n“Kuak!”\nStarting with the head, the color of the being turned white. Even the wings were all frost white, as if it were now a cold corpse.\n“Huh? You killed it?”\nThe golden Gumiho, who was on Chun Yeowun’s shoulders, asked with a puzzled expression, as she first thought that they had just lost the chance to dig up information.\nIt was then,\nSomething hazy like a ghost rose from the cold corpse. Even some of Chun Yeowun’s subordinates were shocked by the sight.\n“Huh?”\n“Spirit?”\nIt was a fuzzy-looking but winged spirit that resembled the dead Heaven clan member. Chun Yeowun smiled.\n‘Success.’\nHis prediction was spot-on.\nUnlike the demons, the members of Talisha’s clan could be turned to Ghosts. Chun Yeowun, who dug his hand into the member’s body, saw that they were similar to humans in physical structure.\nBeings with a flowing blood and heart could be turned to Ghosts, which is what happened.\nShhh!\nBy touching the Ghost, its memories could be read.\nIts memories began to flow into Chun Yeowun, who had turned the being into a Ghost.\nThey were the memories that the being was thinking of 15 minutes back, including things that Chun Yeowun had asked. The memories then showed the being protesting against a blonde human-like being with white wings and a silver crown on his head in a three-dimensional hologram.\n[High priest, just how long do we wait?]\n[The time hasn’t come yet.]\n[Sigh.]\nThe being seemed frustrated.\n[Isn’t it better to take the planet into our hands and have those humans become our devotees?]\n[Don’t think for yourself!]\nThe being called the High Priest shouted. Flustered, the being on the ship fell to its knees and pleaded.\n[T-This foolish priest committed blasphemy. Please punish me.]\n[Do not cross the line. Young priest, concentrate on the given task. The High Priest will do the search for the missing one.]\n[I understand.]\nWhen the being said that, the hologram was cut off.\nConfirming that it was successfully disconnected, the Heaven clan member mumbled in dissatisfaction.\n[It’s been 27 years already, looking down on this one planet in this damned space! That bastard just sits in Heaven and gives such dumb instructions…]\nCack!\nHe grunted through his teeth. Full of anger, he approached the window and looked out at the blue Earth, thinking,\n‘How long do we have to work on finding the 6th Talisha? Does the one who disappeared after obsessing over Arisha really exist on this one small planet?’\nThe last memory ended there. Chun Yeowun was confused once he had seen all the memories because the information he heard was unexpected.\n‘Their goal wasn’t conquest?’\nAccording to the memories of the being that was now a Ghost, it seemed like they were looking for Talisha. In addition, it felt like no one knew if Talisha was alive or dead.\nFor 27 years, they couldn’t find anyone and clung to the hope that Talisha was still on Earth. Chun Yeowun looked at the Ghost.\n‘Then, the Heavenly clan is here to find Talisha, who is supposedly on Earth?’\nThe High Priest had said that Talisha was obsessed with Arisha, meaning that he had come to Earth for Chun Yeowun’s ancestor.\nCome to think of it, it was said that during the Great War, Talisha and Arisha were both injured.\n‘Hmm.’\nIt seemed like the Ghost didn’t know everything, but at least it was certain that the Heaven clan’s goal wasn’t to conquer Earth.\nAt that moment, Bi Mak-heon ran to him.\n“Chun Ma!”\n“What is it?”\n“Chun Ma received a call from Mr. Geum Seong-ryong of Blade Six.”\n“Huh? Why?”\n“There seems to be a problem with the MS Group.”\n“What? Were we told anything about it?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, Bi Mak-heon hesitated and said.\n“T-that…”\nHu Bong answered,\n“I tried to speak through the things Lord put in my head, but you didn’t answer.”\nHu Bong spoke was talking about the nano bombs that had been altered to allow Chub Yeowun to communicate with his subordinates. They originally had worked while he was on Earth, but,\n[Entering the thermosphere was out of the frequency range.]\nNano explained why.\n‘Ahhh…’\nChun Yeowun didn’t think such a problem would occur. Still, it didn’t take long for the issue to be resolved.\nBi Mak-heon was then asked to call back the Blade Six chairman.\n“Understood.”\nBi Mak-heon hastily contacted them back, but despite the ring, no one answered the call.\nHe then said,\n“Chun Ma, they aren’t answering the call.”\nExpressway to the northeast of Chengdu city.\nForty minutes from there was Chengdu station, where the underground speed train operated.\nThere was a huge crater, as if a bomb had been dropped in the middle, and several damaged buses were lying around.\nThe highway was filled with flames as if a war was happening.\n“Kuak…”\nGeum Seong-ryong had been injured and was coughing up blood. Suddenly, metal structures strong enough to tear down buildings were hurled at him.\nChachacha!\nAt the location he was looking at, Hwang-heol was fighting an unknown person who was wearing a red mask.\nChachacha!\nAfter constantly clashing with the red-masked man for a few seconds, Hwang-heol was thrown back.\nPapak!\n“Kuak!”\nHe couldn’t maintain his balance and his body staggered, struggling to stand up.\nHwang-heol raised his stiff face with trembling red eyes.\n‘It’s “that” bastard.’",

      "content": "Chapter 220: Cho Yushin (1)\nHwang-heol — one of the four Elders of the Blade God Six Martial Clan and one of the most trusted servants of the Blade God. He was the one who helped the Blade God after they fought against Ark Wui and Chun Yeowun.\nWheik!\nThe man wearing a red mask walking along the road was covered in flames. He was hiding his face, but Hwang-heol was certain.\n‘It’s him.’\nAround 350 years ago, a monster-like old man took the Imogi's corpse, its blood, and the life of Hwang-heol’s beloved lady.\nHwang-heol was convinced after fighting for more than a dozen seconds.\n“You!”\nHwang-heol groaned as he took off his clothes. He was the one who reacted quickly to the unexpected presence. The corpses of their clan members were pilled into the buses so they could move and defend their hidden base.\n“You have gotten pretty strong.\nHehehe\n. At that time, even the three of you couldn’t handle this old man’s attacks.”\nHwang-heol frowned at the voice.\nThe voice sounded like it was from a young man.\n‘It’s different.’\nHwang-heol still remembered the voice despite the years passed due to his hatred for the old man. Then\nwhose\nthis voice?\n“You… who are you?”\n“Hmm. You forgot about this old man already?”\nThe red-masked man threw the blade at Hwang-heol.\nShhh!\nThe flying blade moved on its own—it was an Air Sword.\n“\nHuh!\n”\nHwang-heol moved his upper body towards the sword, slowly evaded it, and hit the middle of the blade.\nChachacha!\nThe crossing blades began to break into fragments and flew at the masked man. It was a high-level technique in which the blade—\nno\n, each fragment of the blade was loaded with energy.\nIt might seem like a simple technique, but the fragments of the blade were all aimed at the red-masked man.\n“Huhuhu.”\nThe masked man lifted his palm up and then lowered it. Then flying fragments fell to the ground as if the gravity rose.\n“The previous blade has been broken.”\n“Don’t act like that for a stolen blade.”\nOne of those that tumbled out of the bus was the broken blade.\nHwang-heol’s eyes looked at the red-masked man.\nThe voice was youthful, and the martial arts talents were something he encountered from the old man he met 350 years ago and Chun Yeowun.\n‘Did he go through a body transformation?’\nThat seemed most likely. However, it didn’t matter if the elderly man got younger or anything. He was still the man who had murdered his lover in front of him.\nPhat!\nAs Hwang-heol extended his hand, the ground began to tremble, and the road cracked and rose up into sharp shards.\nPapapak!\nThe attack was being made with the energies of the Spirit Beasts.\nHowever, the red-masked man only laughed at him.\nThud!\nHe stepped ahead then the stones on the floor that was about to attack him dispersed.\n“Your blade energy is weak. You should use it this way.”\nThe masked man stepped onto the floor.\nThud!\nAt the same time, he reached out to Hwang-heol. Then the stones on the floor tried to lock him in from east, west, north, and south as if a giant beast was about to eat him.\nWheik!\nHowever, since the stones were engulfed in fire, the heat felt like it was lava.\nIt didn’t end there.\nBlue sparks rose in the air, and tremendous lightning struck them.\n‘How is he dealing with the Five Spirit Beasts’ energy this way?’\nAside from anger, Hwang-heol admired his opponent’s power. Unlike himself, who dealt with the energy as an auxiliary, the man with a red mask was able to handle it skillfully.\n‘However!’\nHazy invisible energy rose to form a blade from Hwang-heol’s hand. He grabbed it with both hands and then lowered it to the floor with force.\nBang!\n“\nAhhh!\n”\nKwakwakwa!\nThe energy of the invisible blade that had sunk into the ground spread out in eight directions, tearing away the stone walls that had been heated like lava pressing around them.\nIt was the Eight Xian Blade technique.\nBang!\nMeanwhile, lightning hit him from above. However, it just looked like it since he had vanished and reappeared in front of the masked man.\nShhh!\nHwang-heol used the\nfifth technique\nwith an invisible blade. It was the Extreme Fast Slashing Blade that unfolded with the footwork.\nSlash!\nHwang-heol’s invisible blade tried to cut off the masked man’s neck. However, the man in front of him managed to avoid the invisible blade at a tremendous speed.\n‘He avoided this?’\nIn that state, he extended his fist to Hwang-heol’s chest, and Hwang-heol somersaulted1 to the back.\nKwakwang!\nHowever, the fist had extended several tens of meters, making the road a mess. If it had been a little later, Hwang-heol would have been swept away.\n‘Kuak!’\nHe tried to avoid it, but his back was hurting due to his aging body.\nAs if noticing this, the red-masked man reached out with his blade and attempted to strike him.\nShhh!\nAn invisible blade tried to pierce Hwang-heol.\n“\nHuh!\n”\nHe used an invisible blade as a shield despite the disheveled form.\nKwang!\nThere was a tearing sensation as if the invisible blades were being torn.\n‘What is this energy?’\nThat was what it seemed like.\nPang!\n“\nKwak!\n”\nHwang-heol’s body bounced back as if a cannonball-like force had hit him. However, he was a veteran. In that brief moment of flight, the blade was drawn towards the man wearing a red mask.\nThen…\n“\nKuak!\n”\nThe red-masked man holding out the blade was pushed five steps back. What seemed like blood flowed through the cracks behind the red mask.\nCak!\nThe red-masked man clutched his chest briefly because Hwang-heol used Heart Blade.\n“Good. To make this old man bleed...”\nJjjkkkk!\nA sharp sense flowed from the bottom of the red-masked man, and then the floor cracked in all directions. The Heart Blade energy inside him was discharged out of his body.\nCrack!\nMeanwhile, Hwang-heol bounced back and used an invisible blade to stop himself from going further away. He looked tired.\n‘What a fight.’\nGeum Seong-ryong, who was watching this, bit his tongue. It was indeed a battle of the bests. But there were differences.\nHwang-heol was battling this hard for the first time since the battle with Demon God.\n‘Now I understand why the Elder was wary of MS Group.’\nWho would have guessed they were hiding in MS? Geum Seong-ryong tried to turn on his smartphone. However, the smartphone’s battery was drained.\n‘Damn it.’\nAll the smartphones were turned off when the red-masked man appeared, and it seemed like an EMP was used. It was deliberately done to avoid contact with the outside world.\n‘If only I can contact Demon God.’\nHe sincerely hoped for that.\nGeum Seong-ryong suddenly remembered something as he looked at the red-masked man with anxious eyes. They have a special phone with an EMP sensor developed by Blade Six’s research team.\n‘Was it on the 3rd bus?’\nGeum Seong-ryong looked around to find the 3rd bus. Many buses were overturned and were on fire, so he hoped this one bus was safe.\nAt that moment, he found something.\n‘Ah!’\nIt was the 3rd bus cut in half, and unlike other buses, it wasn’t on fire which meant the phone had to be safe.\nGeum Seong-ryong looked at the red-masked man. With his own abilities, he couldn’t block the attacks.\n‘I have to aim when the Elder is fighting.’\nTo not get his attention, Geum Seong-ryong reduced his presence, covered himself in the soot, and looked for a chance.\nAs if not noticing, the red-masked one approached Hwang-heol.\nAnd the red-masked man said,\n“You kept hiding, didn’t you? Then you should have just held onto your life. That\nold bitch\nwho gave up her life to make sure to save you is now thrown into waste.”\nHwang-heol’s face contorted at it.\n‘Ma Hu-yeon!’\nHer last moment came to his mind. The bloody sacrifice he had to see.\nHe shouted in rage.\n“You bastard!”\n“Come on.”\nEyes shining in red could be seen through the mask. The eyes were clearly showing excitement. The masked man was definitely enjoying the battle after a long time.\nWhoong!\nThe Five Spirit Beasts’ energy was gathered in Hwang-heol’s hand that held the invisible blade. It was the greatest marvel that individuals who had attained the Heavenly Realm could unfold.\n“Right. Allow this old man to enjoy this fight more.”\nThe red-masked man walked towards him, and Hwang-heol shouted.\n“This will be the tomb for the both of us.”\nHwang-heol was ready to throw his life away. It was only for this moment that he endured the harsh life.\n‘Hu-yeon, I will take him to the underworld.’\nIn that way, at least, he can face his woman with a proud smile. Hwang-heol gathered all the spirit energy into his hand, and then…\nShhh!\nThe red-masked man, who was walking, stretched out his hand somewhere. At that moment, a loud explosion came.\nKwaang!\nIt was a bus that exploded. Then he saw the figure of Geum Seong-ryong going close to the bus had bounced back. Geum Seong-ryong looked around, shocked.\n“Don’t do anything useless. Kid.”\nAt the words of the red-masked man, Geum Seong-ryong’s face turned desperate.\nHe thought they wouldn’t notice, but the man was aware. There was no way he could move now.\n‘… it’s over.’\nGeum Seong-ryong bowed his head. There was no longer any way to contact the outside world. Maybe today will be the day when the Blade God Six Martial clan comes to an end.\n“Then how about we end it?”\nWoong!\nAround the red-masked man, five colors began to shine, making a shocking thing happen. The spirit energy was turned into a weapon.\n“This old man will show you blade dance.”\nWhat an overwhelming force, Hwang-heol’s eyes shook as he watched the opponent be better than him with the Five Spirit Beasts’ energy.\n‘How can this….’\nAs he grew, so did the monster. His mind, thinking of dying and taking the man with him, was confused. However, the red-masked man stopped approaching him.\nTak!\nThen the red-masked man mumbled.\n“This guy…”\nThe weapon with the spirit energy that floated around the red-masked man disappeared, and then he flew up.\nWhen he suddenly left, Hwang-heol was speechless.\n‘Why?’\nIn a stone mountain in the desert about 110km away from Chengdu City, numerous corpses were scattered throughout the enormous hidden basement inside it.\nSomeone in a black suit was leisurely walking among the numerous corpses. It was Chun Yeowun.\n[Emergency! Emergency! Emergency!]\nWarning tones constantly sounded through the basement’s speaker.\nAngel’s Corner\nThe last scene was POG!\nSomersault – [noun/verb] an acrobatic movement in which a person turns head over heels in the air or on the ground and lands or finishes on their feet.

      "content": "Chapter 221: Cho Yushin (2)\nJust 20 minutes ago…\nWhen Blade Six Chairman Geum Seong-ryong didn't answer the phone despite several calls, Bi Mak-heon was worried.\n[He didn't answer?]\n[Something seems to have gone wrong.]\n[Hmm…]\nChun Yeowun began to think from then on.\nGeum Seong-ryong had called saying that he had an urgent matter, despite Blade Six having strong warriors and Hwang-heol as well.\n'An enemy Hwang-heol couldn't face.'\nThat was the most likely situation.\nIf Hwang-heol couldn't deal with the enemy, that meant that the main power behind MS had moved and that Blade Six had touched something that made MS move.\n'\nSo they ound it.'\nChun Yeowun was sure that Blade Six must have found the headquarters of MS Group.\n[Mak-heon.]\n[Yes, Lord Chun Ma?]\n[Where was the last coordinate sent by Blade Six?]\nChun Yeowun checked the coordinates of the last place that Blade Six sent. In Blade Six's report, they said that they had found what they assumed to be the base.\nRecognizing Chun Yeowun's intention, Bi Mak-heon spoke.\n[I will check for the location based on their navigation path.]\nHe selected a total of 3 places; unlike Blade Six, who moved one by one to scout, Chun Yeowun could search an entire area with his spatial movement.\nHe quickly found a base on the second place that Bi Mak-heon had selected: the stone mountain.\nThis base's strict security system, which was incomparable to that of other bases, convinced Chun Yeowun and Bi Mak-heon that this was MS Group's main base.\nEverything developed by MS was being revealed from genetic humans to combat weapons. There were only a few hundred people near the entrance.\nBang! Bang!\n\"Kuak!\"\n\"Ack!\"\nHowever, Chun Yeowun was too strong for them to handle.\nChun Yeowun walked in a straight line and dealt with the enemies without even lifting a hand.\nBefore people could even come close, their heads would explode or be crushed down.\n[Emergency! Emergency! Emergency!]\nA warning sound blared, signaling that the base's main system was aware that a mighty enemy had arrived. Numerous CCTV screens in the base illuminated the presence of a single person.\nOf course, it was none other than Chun Yeowun.\n[The 4th sector has been breached. 50% of the genetically mutated biological weapons have been mobilized to stop the intruder.]\n[The 5th sector has been breached. 40% of the bodily modified weapons have been mobilized to stop the intruder.]\nChun Yeowun broke through the sectors at high speeds; his actions had no strategy or plan. Who would attempt to break into an enemy camp without a plan?\nWell, Chub Yeowun was undeniably arrogant and strong, and his madness was evident.\nBang!\nOn the CCTV screen, Chun Yeowun was seen killing people without lifting a hand.\nGenetically mutated weapons and bodily modified weapons continued to pour in to stop him, but they would die before they could even get within 30 meters of his location.\nPik!\nA map appeared on one of the screens, showing a red dot moving at high speed. Although it was moving incredibly fast, it would take another 15 minutes to reach where the map was located.\nWith this force, it would take less than three minutes for Chun Yeowun to reach the center.\nSomething was typed into the black screen, which seemed like the main terminal.\n[Temporary sequence has been entered, changed to protect the base.]\n[Main sequence #1932.]\n[Transferring the recorded brain information to tubes 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, brain, and body of the test.]\nWoong!\nComputers could be heard working together. Before long, tubes containing a mysterious liquid moved as humans began to form inside them.\nDrrr!\n[Upload: 60% complete.]\n[Upload: 70% complete.]\n[Upload: 80% complete.]\nChachacha!\nWhile the upload was in progress, the glass tubes labeled 02, 05 and 08 broke, and a human sprung out from the broken glass.\nIts head, however, looked like a broken watermelon.\n[Tubes 02, 05, and 08 failed to have the information uploaded to the brain.]\n[Upload: 90% complete.]\n[Upload: 100% complete.]\nWhen the message said that the upload was complete, the body in the main glass tube, which was convulsing, stopped. A drain pipe opened at the bottom of the main glass tube and drained it of the fluids. Once the liquid was drained, the glass tube opened.\nClank!\nAs the glass tube opened, air flowed in, and the device that looked like a helmet was released. Five hairless, humanoid beings came out.\n\"\nCough…__Cough…\n\"\nThey coughed, as it was hard to breathe because they had just gotten up. Nonetheless, their breathing quickly stabilized.\nWhing!\nMonitor screens rose from the floor and stopped in front of the five humanoid beings. A man with a mask that had a visibly engraved letter 'A' on his face was seen on the monitor.\nA voice came out of the speaker and spoke to the five at the same time.\n\"First, I would like to apologize that the plan went a little off. With the data transferred, you have to block the incoming man until the main man arrives.\"\nIn response, the five beings adopted an absurd expression.\n\"Main man?\"\nMeanwhile, Chun Yeowun was passing through a sector called Sector 8. Numerous people jumped to intercept him and used many techniques to stop Chun Yeowun, but he was still taking them down without using his hands.\nHe was completely unmatched in power.\nChun Yeowun was actually able to reach the center much more quickly, but he decided to slow down and take care of the people for two reasons.\nThe first reason was to remove all the power and development within MS, and the second was to distract the enemies from Blade Six, who seemed to be facing trouble.\n'\nI seem to be destroying the base rather quickly.'\nIn the current state, it seemed like Chun Yeowun wasn't facing many difficulties as he breezed through the base. However, Chun Yeowun's eyes noticed something strange as he was moving.\n'\nThey're moving away.'\nThe enemies that had been running towards him previously were now backing out, as if someone strong was coming for backup.\nChun Yeowun detected numerous beings with weird killing intents approaching him.\n'\nAre they coming now?'\nHowever, something was strange: those approaching him seemed to have similar energy. Chun Yeowun held out his hand.\nWoong!\nHundreds of Air Swords formed as Chun Yeowun grabbed onto one of them with his hand and directed the rest ahead.\nSwoosh!\nThe swords, which filled the hall, moved to the new enemies, but a red flash appeared from afar as the Air Swords suddenly disappeared.\n\"Huh...\"\nThe beings who got rid of the Air Swords flew in at an incredible speed.\nThey were naked, muscular, and had no hair at all. Chun Yeowun felt intrigued by their entrance into the battle and held out his hand.\nThen,\nCrack!\nThe space distorted, twisting in front of them as they approached him. The reckless ones who continued to run at the forefront, ignorant of his spatial attack, were swept into the space.\n\"Kuak!\"\nThanks to that, the other ones decided to withdraw. Their desperate response was to break through the wall, ceiling, or even underground; they were doing anything to get away from the twisted space, which was the right choice.\nBang!\nImmediately, the ceiling above Chun Yeowun was pierced as one of the beings approached Chun Yeowun. His eyes shone.\n'\nThis is?'\nIt was Shaolin Temple's Chained God Kick technique, which was performed so skillfully and perfectly that it looked like a Shaolin Monk had appeared.\nChun Yeowun blocked the attack with one hand.\nPapapak!\nAt that moment, two of the humanoids appeared on either side. Chun Yeowun intently looked at the martial arts they performed.\nThe technique that the being to his right performed was none other than the Five Demon Faces technique, which belonged to a clan under the Sky Demon Order.\n'\nAn Evil sect's martial arts?'\nThe being to his left was using the technique of a sect under the Forces of Evil. These beings seemed to be using the most potent martial arts and performing them perfectly without any gaps.\nPapapak!\nOf course, normal warriors would be flustered by their sudden and coordinated attacks, but those beings were dealing with the strongest being on Earth. Chun Yeowun moved forward with one hand behind his back.\nBang!\nAt that moment, a crack formed on the floor, causing fragments to bounce in all directions.\nChachacha!\n'\nShould I imbue the fragments with Sword Energy?'\nChun Yeowun decided to try it out.\nHis planning became even more complicated.\n'\nEach of their blood points needs to be targeted.'\nThe fragments weren't just loaded with sword energy but were being controlled very cleverly.\nPapak!\nUltimately, Chun Yeowun used the fragments to hit three of the humanoids, and those three were thrown back and hit the wall, while the one coming from the ceiling was blown up.\nChun Yeowun mumbled,\n\"Did he avoid it?\"\nThud!\nWhen Chun Yeowun took a step forward, the floor cracked open as a being from under the ground came up. The being was trying to aim for Chun Yeowun from below, but he had managed to move in time.\nShhh!\nWhen Chun Yeowun held out his hand, three Invisible Swords formed in the air. Seeing the Invisible Sword, the being held a blade with both hands and raised it.\nHowever, as the swords moved, the being with a blade mumbled,\n\"You did something stupid.\"\nPuck!\nOne of the Invisible Swords pierced the being's head, and the remaining swords went for its heart and stomach.\nThe being seemed dead, but Chun Yeowun's eyes caught something.\nDrip!\nThe damaged bodies of the beings were rapidly recovering, but that wasn't what shocked Chun Yeowun.\n'\nBlue blood?'\nThere was blue blood dripping from the beings that had been stabbed. It was strange that they had no hair, could use martial arts, and even had blood that wasn't red.\nChun Yeoun reached out to the dead one.\nPak!\nHe turned the body over onto its back. Something was protruding on its side where wing bones were located on the being's back.\nChun Yeowun looked at the strange form curiously when one of the regenerated beings used Sword Energy against Chun Yeowun.\nChachacha!\nA white light condensed on its hand, similar to the way that martial artists used sword energy, but it was slightly different.\nChun Yeowun used Sword Energy against the being's attack to stop it.\nChachachang!\nBlue sparks flashed. Chun Yeowun narrowed his eyes.\n'\nNo internal energy.'\nChun Yeowun subtly felt something strange, and when he clashed with the being, he became aware that the being could use martial arts without having any internal energy.\nChachang!\nThe being unfolded two strong techniques at a highly skilled level, but its techniques weren't just any techniques: they were the best techniques from the Wudang clan and the Mount Hua clan, and it was unfolding them simultaneously.\n'\nWhat's this?'\nIt was the first time Chun Yeowun ever saw anyone perform two different techniques at the same time.\nChun Yeowun had to learn all the martial arts with the Nano's, but this being seemed to be different. It wasn't just this being, but other ones also seemed to have the same capabilities.\n'\nEven if they aren't martial artists, they keep changing their techniques and don't seem flustered when blocked.'\nSince Chun Yeowun knew the techniques, he knew where to look for gaps.\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun grabbed the wrist of a being that was in the middle of changing techniques.\nPak!\nGrrrr!\nThe being raised the energy in its body, but that wasn't enough to shake off Chun Yeowun. Chun Yeowun opened his mouth and said,\n\"You guys… must be hiding a lot.\"\nAt Chun Yeowun's question, the being smiled and said,\n\"We aren't hiding anything. With this body, we've reached our limit.\"\n\"This body?\"\nChun Yeowun was puzzled; it seemed that this wasn't its original body.\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"If it weren't for this body, this would have been a fun fight with you, Demon God. It is a pity that my role is small.\"\nGoo!\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun sensed a strong presence at the end of the passage he was passing through.\nAn intense energy approached, trying to overthrow everything with killing intent. The smell of blood all around hurt Chun Yeowun's nose.\nStep! Step!\nA being with a blood-red mask and blood-stained body walked in.\nLooking at the newcomer, the caught being seemed to like his smell of blood.\n\"Hmm, you must have enjoyed it.\"\n\"Well, it's me,\"\nThe red-masked man said, looking at the being. The being responded with a bitter voice,\n\"I didn't know this would be such a time-consuming role, but clean this up, main body.\"\nThe man in the red mask nodded.\n\"Good work. Now, let this old man take charge.\"\nPhat!\nAt that moment, another being flew towards Chun Yeowun, who lightly flicked his finger behind him without watching.\nPang!\n\"Kuak!\"\nThe being flew back while screaming in pain; there was a noticeable hole in its chest as it flew back.\nKwang!\nThe being that had its wrist held seemed surprised by the outcome of the sudden attack. Yeowun looked at the red masked man and said with a smile,\n\"Do you people really think you were able to stall for time?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 222: Cho Yushin (3)\n'\nHe was the one acting.'\nThe surprise was brief.\nThe reckless being returned to his original form and shook his head.\nThen, he said to Chun Yeowun,\n\"Looks like you did what you intended, Demon God. You definitely succeeded in getting attention.\"\nThanks to this, Hwang-heol and Geum Seong-ryong, the last of Blade Six, survived. However, the being didn't have regrets; instead, he smiled.\n\"But you made a mistake of gathering all your enemies into one place.\"\n\"Well, this is a one-time chance.\"\nChun Yeowun seemed relaxed, and the being spoke.\n\"We know your strength, but do you know of us?\"\nSomething flew towards Chun Yeowun's head as soon as the words were finished. It was the Energy Sword of the Five Spirit Beasts.\n'\nFive Spirit Beasts' energy sword?'\nThis meant that his opponent reached the Heavenly Master level.\nThe sword flying in intends to pierce Chun Yeowun's head, but Chun Yeowun would not let that happen.\nWoong!\nHis own Five Spirit Beasts' energy sword appeared like a shield.\nPang! Kwakwang!\nA powerful wave was created when the two collided, and the basement sank 50 meters below ground. Nature's energy imbues the Five Spirit Beasts' energy sword. It was something more powerful than the invisible sword.\n'\nAs expected, it's fast.'\nThe being stuck his tongue at the speed of Chun Yeowun controlling his sword. And then he decided to play his part even though his body was controlled by internal energy.\n'\nThe self-destruct has been activated.'\nGoo!\nThe entire body of the being was dyed in red, and heat soared. Chun Yeowun, who held the wrist, began to use Ice Qi.\nJjkkk!\nThe being froze before he could explode. He was shocked that his self-destruction was stopped.\nPhat!\nAt that moment, the red masked man appeared in front of Chun Yeowun and tried to attack with his fist, and Chun Yeowun responded in the same way.\nPhat!\nAs they collided, they bounced off by force.\nKwang!\nChun Yeowun's eyes widened in surprise as they collided and moved backward simultaneously.\nIt was because the power of the red-masked man was stronger than what he expected. The energy he used in his fist was to block, but given how far back his weapon had moved, his enemy had to be more powerful than demons.\nThud!\nThe red-masked man came out of the crumbling wall and tried to relax his neck muscles.\nPak!\nThe red-masked man took off his mask and threw it to the floor. Seeing that, Chun Yeowun narrowed his eyes.\n\"Sayogi?\"\nHe had the same face as Sayogi, the Heavenly Killing Star.\nChun Yeowun remembered the clones of Sayogi he saw in MS' hidden base.\n\"Are you a clone too?\"\nAt his question, the man with Sayogi's face laughed.\n\"\nHuhuhu\n.\"\nHe was laughing like an old man. It was natural, but the voice didn't match the body.\nThe man looked at Chun Yeowun and said,\n\"Unfortunately, you are wrong. I am the original.\"\n\"Original?\"\n\"Well, I really wanted to see you. That was why this old man put so much effort into raising that child.\"\n\"Raising?\"\nHearing those words, memories flashed through Chun Yeown's mind. Sayogi talked of another person like him. And he heard of it from the Eun Jarim, about a warrior who lived for long being related to MS Group.\nWith that, Chun Yeowun guessed who this was.\n\"Cho Yushin.\"\n\"\nHoh.\n\"\n\"You are the old man who raised Sayogi.\"\n\"Do you know me?\"\nThis man, Cho Yushin, seemed surprised.\nThere were very few people who knew about him, even in the Eun Jarim. However, Cho Yushin never controlled information about him; living for so long, he knew the information was bound to come out.\nStep! Step!\nChun Yeowun stepped ahead and said,\n\"If you are the original, why did you make clones similar to you? Were you trying to mess with the world?\"\n\"Mess the world?\nHahaha.\n\"\nCho Yushin laughed as if that was absurd. Then he continued,\n\"If that was the purpose, the old man would have stepped ahead right away. Wouldn't I have?\"\nThe killing intent from the words of Cho Yushin went beyond the ordinary.\nThe killing intent was as if he resented everything about the world. Chun Yeowun couldn't understand how the man could still smile with so much killing intent.\n\"Humans are truly fragile creatures. Even though there are numerous developments, it is finite like a flower which will eventually fall into darkness.\"\nHe seemed skeptical of the human lifespan.\nThen, Cho Yushin continued.\n\"Where in the world is this foolish body, which dies no matter how powerful it becomes?\"\nChun Yeowun frowned at those words. At first, he thought the purpose of the clones was to increase crazy people like him—to create a group of them. But listening to it, it seemed what the man wanted was eternal life.\nBut what did that have to do with making clones?\nSuddenly, Chun Yeowun thought of Cho Yushin's conversation with the other being.\n[It's me.]\n[I didn't think this would be so time-consuming, but please clean up,\nmain body\n.]\n[You did well. Now, let this old man take charge.]\nCho Yushin called himself original, and Chun Yeowun thought so...\n'\nHe can clone himself and not just the body?'\nThe answer was given by Nano.\n[It isn't impossible. It is possible if it has the technology to transfer the forebrain, which has converted all the memory information of the brain to data and into another body.]\nIt is not a complex technology in the environment in which Nano was created. The technology, however, was legally prohibited. A SOUL's existence was controversial at the time. Nonetheless, there was a general belief that just copying memory does not contain a person's soul but rather simply breaths memories into a body.\nJust because they had the technology, it didn't mean it could be done.\nChun Yeowun shook his head.\n\"You are crazier than I thought. Do you want to covet eternal life?\"\nIn the end, the clones were created to extend his lifespan. Chun Yeowun had an open mind more than others, but he had contempt for those who thought like Cho Yushin.\nAt Chun Yeowun's words, Cho Yushin laughed and said,\n\"Do you know how big this old man's will is?\"\n\"'\nBig'\nin what way?\"\n\"Eternal life? It is just an addition.\"\n\"Addition? How nonsense.\"\n\"I seek nothing but perfection. Even if there is a perfect mind and the body doesn't follow, it is meaningless.\"\nGoo!\nWoong!\nAs soon as he said that, the energy around Cho Yushin increased rapidly, and hundreds of weapons with the Five Spirit Beasts' energy were created. Chun Yeowun's eye narrowed at it.\n'\nA perfect Heavenly Master level.'\nTaking in the cores of the beasts. If this was the case, it indicated that this individual had no internal energy constraints.\nCho Yushin smiled.\n\"Such unfortunate times. I had a regret after hearing the story that the second Chun Ma destroyed the one who managed to defeat this old man. Finally, I can relive that regret.\"\nPhat!\nThen Cho Yushin moves toward Chun Yeowun while hundred of the weapons are ready to move.\n\"Try handling the Hundred Blades.\"\nCho Yushin waved his hand, and the blades around the area unfolded techniques showing how expert the one handling them was.\nSwish!\nEven Chun Yeowun felt amazed.\n'\nHe can handle all hundred of them?'\nChun Yeowun could do that because of Nano's help. However, Cho Yushin could do it with pure talent and effort alone.\nWhat was more was that each blade was moving in the best way possible.\n'\nHow to stop it?'\nThis man was aware of the abilities of Chun Yeowun. That was why he was confident that he wouldn't lose to him. At that moment, Chun Yeowun raised his hand.\nAnd then…\nCrack!\nThe space in all directions twisted with intense energy flowing out. The space itself moved like a sword.\nCho Yushin's eyes twinkled at it.\n'\nAs expected, he can handle space.'\nHe watched it from afar but seeing it in person was very different.\nChachacha!\nThe blades that held such strong power collided with the twisted space and were shattered.\nEven Hwang-heol's blades could work against him. As his blades disappeared, Chun Yeowun walked toward him.\n\"I stopped it. What else are you going to show me now?\"\nAt Chun Yeowun's question, Cho Yushin applauded.\nClap! Clap!\n\"Amazing! You are really amazing!\"\n\"There is no need to be that shocked.\"\n\"I was convinced that the Heavenly Master level wasn't the end, but seeing it in front of my eyes made it clear!\"\nAt those words, Chun Yeowun narrowed his eyes. Even though the opponent he is facing is overpowering him, he still seems excited. It's as if he wanted to also use the Space Sword.\n\"Thank you because you've shown the old man the way.\"\n\"You are overconfident. Do you think you will survive here?\"\nAt Chun Yeowun's words, Cho Yushin smiled.\n\"You made the mistake of coming here.\"\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun, who thought that something was up, reached out to his enemy. Sharp anticipation sprang out and twisted the space, then surrounded Cho Yushin.\nIt was then.\nPapapak!\nThe anticipation aiming for Cho Yushin turned at once, and Nano said,\n[The vector values and direction have been forcibly adjusted.]\n'\nWhat?'\nHis attacks were moving and destroying the base but not the target. Chun Yeowun frowned at the strange power which even affected his space.\nCho Yushin smiled.\n\"You are late,\nB\n.\"\nAt that moment, the place where Cho Yushin was standing opened, and something like an elevator came out. Someone appeared wearing a silver mask with a letter B mark on it.\n'\nA B mask.'\nHe is one of the 10 executives of the MS Group that was the closest to the commander.\nMost of the executives have died at the hands of Chun Yeowun, but one or two of them weren't found.\n\"Sorry. It took me some time.\"\n\"It does not matter since you came when it mattered. Now,\nA\n!\"\nA voice was heard at Cho Yushin's cry.\n— EV will operate in the industrial field.\nWoong!\nAt that moment, energy beyond imagination surged from the base.\n'\nWhat is this?'\nChun Yeowun looked at the floor. The moment different energy was released, the energy around and the one in Chun Yeowun's body scattered.\n— The acetic acid hole system and the wide EV field have been successfully activated.\nThe altered avoid of\nA\nsaid from the speaker. Then Cho Yushin smiled.\n\"You entered your grave.\"\n\"You prepared a lot.\"\n\"It will be different from what you experienced outside. Being in the base is real perfection.\"\nHe could feel it. The energy flowing from the bottom of the base was so intense that it couldn't be compared to the one Murim Association used.\n\"You guys must be the same.\"\nEveryone was in the same position. At that, The person wearing a B mask, who is also presumed to be called\nB,\nflicked his fingers.\nCrack!\nThe ceiling around Chun Yeowun collapsed and fell around him.\nUkukuku!\nTo be precise, it was everywhere except for where Chun Yeowun stood.\nThe person wearing a\nB\nmask saw an energy device emitting a blue magnetic field attached to Cho Yushin's chest.\n\"This has nothing to do with us.\"\nThe device was made for the abilities to be used. Cho Yushin tapped\nB\n's shoulder and said,\n\"Even without this kind of thing, this friend and this old man have the strongest abilities that are enough to defeat you. But you see, a tiger should do its best even when hunting a rabbit1.\"\nCho Yushin considered\nB\nto be someone with the strongest ability. Come to think of it,\nH,\nwho was now one of Chun Yeowun's subordinates, said something.\n[I heard that one of two—B or C are the most powerful.]\nHe didn't know their abilities, but what was certain was that when it unfolds, Chun Yeowun's Space Sword is made to change directions.\nThen, as Nano said, he could manipulate the vector values or directions. Then, the man had to really be the strongest.\nTok! Tok!\nSomething like water dripped. Cho Yushin turned and looked at\nB\n.\nThere was blood dripping from\nB\n's chin.\n'\nHe overdid it.'\nCho Yushin bit his tongue.\nB\n's brain must be overloaded.\nHe thought it would be daunting to use his ability that warps space, but he couldn't fight Chun Yeowun alone.\nB\nbleed with just one attempt.\n'\nIt doesn't matter. If B controls the vector value once or twice and blocks the attacks, the old man can kill him.'\nIn that fleeting moment, he could end it.\nThe result is obvious.\nNow, Chun Yeowun was caught in their trap and could do nothing. Even if he forced himself to get past the system and try to do something, he could never defeat the two of them.\nThen a voice from the speaker was heard.\n— He could be a test subject with the best conditions. Catch him, Cho Yushin.\n\"Even if you didn't say it, I would do it.\"\nThe body of Demon God, known to be the strongest on earth, was what they wanted the most.\nStep!\nCho Yushin walked toward Chun Yeowun. The magnetic field device on his chest made it possible for him to use his internal energy, but it was still challenging to use the Five Spirit Beasts' Energy Sword.\nPerhaps, the only space\nB\ncould control was in this area, so his space to attack was limited.\n'\nMaybe, we should just be prepared to stop him?'\nIt couldn't be figured out for sure. Cho Yushin smiled and said to Chun Yeowun, who was silent.\n\"It isn't the strong one who overcomes things, but the one who overcomes is the strong one. Demon God.\"\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun looked at them and said,\n\"Can a\nwill\nbe defined as a vector?\"\n\"…!?\"\nHearing that, Cho Yushin was puzzled for a second, then he shouted nervously as he realized something.\n\"\nA\n! Let\nB\nget down—-\"\nIt was then.\n\"Kuak!\"\nB\ngrabbed his chest.\nBlood gushed out from the cracks of the mask.\n\"W… what is this?\"\nThen he fell down.\nThud!\n\"Heart Sword!\"\nCho Yushin grunted. He thought he had calculated everything, but he was wrong.\nThe Heart Sword is the power of the user's will. Even if\nB\ncould control the vectors, his ability could not do much when it came to the sword made by the user's will.\n\"He should not live.\nA\n, I will kill him.\"\nCho Yushin thought it was a problem they could not control. The monster that could open his path with the slightest gap: Chun Yeowun.\nThen Chun Yeowun held out his hand.\n\"It is impossible! No matter how much you go beyond the Heavenly Master level, in this area—\"\nBefore he could even finish speaking, Chun Yeowun moved his hand up as if lifting something. Cho Yushin didn't know what his opponent was doing. It was trying to force his internal energy to flow.\n\"I said it is impossible.\"\nGrrrr!\nThe earth's axis shook violently.\n\"Hun?\"\nJjjkkkk!\nCrack!\nThe entire base was destroyed. The vibration was so strong that the whole ground and walls cracked.\nIt was shaking severely that they couldn't stand.\n\"W-what…\"\nEven A's voice came from the speaker.\n— How can this…\nCho Yushin couldn't understand.\n\"W-what happened?\"\n— The entire base… is rising.\n'\n!!!'\nIt was something one wouldn't know if they were inside. This massive earthquake was happening because the base of MS Group was rising.\nOutside, the entire mountain was rising, and something unbelievable happened.\n'\nH-He?'\nChun Yeowun spoke to Cho Yushin.\n\"Your trap is too small.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 223: Commander A (1)\nNo matter how perfect the plan was, who could have foreseen a future like this? As if Earth’s gravity had vanished, the stone mountain was rising.\nGrrr!\nThis was a situation that Commander\nA\nand Cho Yushin both didn’t expect. The biggest problem was the base rising up.\nCrackle!\nThe entire interior was cracking and shattering while lights began to flicker out of control; it seemed like the entire base would be destroyed at any moment.\nShhhhh!\nA problem was encountered as the powerlines in the base were cut when the stone mountain rose out of the ground. Because the ventilation system and a wide EV field required a lot of energy, the MS members would be in trouble.\n‘Did he do all that just for this? Ha!’\nCho Yushin couldn’t hide his shock when he realized that the previously dispersed energy began to flow once more. Then, he thought,\n‘He needs to be stopped.’\nIt would take time for his mind to transfer to the rest of the clones, and that process wouldn’t finish if Chun Yeowun’s interference continued. This was his only chance to save his end goal right before every connection was cut. Cho Yushin’s killing intent, which he had been suppressing, suddenly exploded.\nPaaang!\nA blood-red energy began to exude from his body as he began to release the true power of the Heavenly Killing Star.\nHis bloodlust to devour everything began to grow rapidly; it was a vicious energy that wanted to destroy everything around him.\nPhat!\nCho Yushin concentrated all of his bloodlust at one point and began to release energy full of killing intent into his Five Spirit Beasts’ energy sword to kill Chun Yeowun.\nChun Yeowun’s eyes shone as he continued to levitate his surroundings..\n‘This…’\nDo those who follow the path of martial arts think the same way?\nThe surrounding energy exploded when the unification of Five Spirit Beasts’ energies merged with the sword full of killing intent. Instinctively, Chun Yeowun knew that this sword’s power was comparable to that of the Supreme Sky Demon Sword.\nJudging from his expertise in energies, Cho Yushin was indeed a martial artist.\nChak!\nA ferocious red line was drawn in the air as Cho Yushin’s sword moved. Cho Yushin’s eyes were locked on his target, but at that moment, Chun Yeowun smiled.\n‘Is he smiling?’\nSuddenly, Cho Yushin, who was still wielding the sword full of killing intent, was thrown into the ceiling.\nBang!\nThe impact caused by the collision between Cho Yushin and the ceiling was incredibly painful.\n“Kuak!”\nCho Yushin’s internal balance was broken.\n‘!?’\nCho Yushin clenched his teeth.\n‘This bastard!’\nHe could guess what had happened: the base, which had been rising, was now falling back to the ground. No matter how strong Cho Yushin was, the weight of tons of buildings suddenly crashing down on him would temporarily disturb his balance.\n“Kuak!”\nCho Yushin, who was being crushed by the falling base, looked at Chun Yeowun, who was moving as if he were launched like a rocket and drawing his sword towards Cho Yushin.\nChak!\nAt that moment, a black straight line was drawn by Chun Yeowun’s Supreme Sky Demon Sword.\nCho Yushin couldn’t afford to take his eye off Chun Yeowun, picking up a sword and imbuing it with his energy.\nChachacha! Kwakwakwa!\nCho Yushin bounced back from the impact as the Supreme Sky Demon Sword and the bloodlust sword clashed. However, Chun Yeowun was quite surprised because Cho Yushin was the first to ever escape the Supreme Sky Demon Sword.\n‘He stopped it?’\nThe power and hunger for blood and annihilation he felt from Cho Yushin was like seeing another side of the Sky Demon energy’s darkness and destruction.\nBang!\nMeanwhile, the falling base collided with the ground. As the 3-kilometer-wide stony mountain fell to the ground, the base shattered and collapsed from the impact.\nCrackle!\nBlue lights and sparks filled the interior of the base. The collision's aftermath caused the base to blackout, resulting in the termination of the EV field and the ventilation system. All that was left was the menacing red aura and the emanating kill aura that wanted to destroy everything.\n“Demon Goddd!’\nCho Yushin was filled with anger. At the same time, his weapon emitted a red light that shone in the darkness as hundreds of swords with the bloodlust energy formed.\n‘I need to win.’\nThis was the Hundred Blood Kill Martial Arts: a technique that held Cho Yushin’s ultimate realization. Because his opponent was so unfathomably strong, Cho Yushin was forced to use his strongest attack, which he had never attempted before.\nJjkkk!\nBlood began to drip from the corner of Cho Yushin’s lips. Because it was so dark, it was impossible to see the blood pouring out of Cho Yushin’s chest, as he couldn’t block Chun Yeowun’s earlier attack.\n‘Monster.’\nThe two warriors seemed to use the same martial arts, but there was a significant difference: the Supreme Sky Demon Sword had the will to kill its opponent.\n“Thanks to you, I’ve figured it out.”\nCho Yushin’s clashes with Chun Yeowun allowed him to fill the gaps in his martial arts and reach the complete form of the Hundred Blood Kill martial arts, which required the willpower to kill someone.\n‘I am lucky to have met you, Demon God.’\nCho Yushin’s red eyes became darker as he extended his sword towards Chun Yeowun’s form, which he could barely make out in the darkness. He then unfolded his technique.\nSwoosh!\nNumerous red lines were drawn as the swords cut through the darkness; the scene was both beautiful and terrifying. Cho Yushin’s eyes, full of intent, were only aiming for Chun yeowun alone.\nCreepy!\nHe felt a single presence of energy that stimulated his senses—a vortex of chaos in the darkness—as Chun Yeowun’s blurry form was sucked into the vortex.\n‘What’s this?’\nAt that moment, he was shocked; the entire area had halted like a vacuum. He couldn’t see or feel anything, but he sensed something moving as his swords suddenly turned and thought,\n‘I need to stop it.’\nHis sixth sense overpowered his other suppressed five senses, and Cho Yushin tried to move through the stopped time, but then something happened.\nShhh!\nA sharp sensation passed through him.\n“Kuak!”\nPang!\nCho Yushin was spun around with a scream and thrown back with a force so strong that he seemed to pierce the air in his path.\nPapapang!\nHe couldn’t stop the attack's aftermath; along with him, his attack was destroyed.\nCho Yushin finally stopped looking around because his eyes were blank and his chest had been pierced.\n“Kuak… kuak…”\nEven though he had absorbed the cores of the Five Spirit Beasts and gained immortality, his pierced chest didn’t heal, as if he no longer had the ability to recover.\nAlong with the pierced chest, his lungs seemed to be damaged, as he was unable to breathe properly.\n‘That technique was…’\nEven though it looked like he was about to die, Cho Yushin could only think about Chun Yeowun's technique.\nInside his mind, he replayed what he had seen. Although there was a difference in power, he thought he would be able to cover the gap with enough willpower. However, he now realized that he had been misled and understood Chun Yeowun’s power.\n‘… perfect.’\nChun Yeowun, his sword, and space became one and couldn’t be stopped.\nStep!\nIn the dark, Cho Yushin heard familiar footsteps approaching him.\n“Immortality… isn’t such a good thing, Cho Yushin.”\n“Huk… huk… huk.”\nChun Yeowun looked down at Cho Yushin’s body, which had been pierced, causing Cho Yushin to struggle to speak to Chun Yeowun.\n“Huk… the… martial… arts… now… what… was… that?”\n“Hmm.”\nChun Yeowun stroked his chin.\nThere was no martial arts technique there, but rather the realization of the technique that Demon King Taura used in the memories Chun Yeowun saw. However, if he had to come up with a name, it would be:\n“Supreme Sky Demon Void-Sword.”\nAs Chun Yeowun wondered if his ancestor would have called it that, Cho Yushin mumbled,\n“Sky… above...the… sky…”\nIt was like seeing another sky above the sky. Chun Yeowun looked at him and asked,\n“I heard that your purpose is to create God. Why is that your plan?”\nCreating a God was absurd.\nHe thought there would be a purpose for them to create such a being, and the reason for asking someone who couldn’t speak was simple:\n‘I’ll make him into a Ghost.’\nAfter all, as long as someone was human, Chun Yeowun could turn them into a Ghost. However, although he wasn’t sure if it would work on immortal beings, it was worth trying. The next question was the most important one.\n“Who is your commander at the base—”\nCrackle!\nIt was then:\nSmall sparks began to fly before Chun Yeowun could even finish asking his question.\nCrackle!\nThey seemed like simple sparks, but there was energy in them. Chun Yeowun frowned.\nThe base was programmed to prevent the enemies from attempting anything.\n‘The system is alive.’\nChun Yeowun grabbed Cho Yushin’s head and moved it to catch the commander before he left the base.\n“Huk… huk… worthless… attempt.”\nChun Yeowun responded to Cho Yushin’s discouraging words,\n“I think I’ll be successful.”\nHe was going to end everything right here. If he could catch the commander behind MS Group, he would be able to find out all of its secrets, along with what had happened to his descendent, Chun Mu-seong.\n[For a year… I spent all my time digitally recording my brain. I don't know if this will work, but I am trying to update my brain records onto the supercomputer Demon God’s AI.]\nThis line from his descendant intrigued Chun Yeowun.\nThe main system was severely damaged by the fall. 80% of the tubes inside had shattered and the beings inside them collapsed as the computers sparked.\nCrackle!\nThe only computer that had survived was the main computer: the supercomputer’s body was made of special titanium that occupied a considerable space.\nOn one side, the text ‘MASIN-2069’ was engraved.\nTatatak!\nAmong the hundreds of screens, the computer displayed a vast amount of information. One screen was tracking the data transfer.\n[Transmission: 98% complete]\nMost of the transfer was complete; once it was finished, the supercomputer could be destroyed.\n[Upload: 90% complete.]\n[Upload: 91% complete.]\n[Upload: 92% complete.]\nMemory, too, was being transmitted to whichever bodies survived the disaster. Although 80% of bodies no longer were suitable, there were still around 132 viable bodies.\nIt would only take a small amount of time to regenerate them.\n[Upload: 95% complete]\nClank! Clank!\nAs the glass tubes shattered, the sound of brains cracking filled the room.\n[Bodies 32, 48, 74, 76, 84, 93, 329, 322, 411, and 513 have failed.]\nNow, only 121 bodies were left.\n[Upload: 98% complete.]\nClank!\n[Bodies 21, 49, 86, 97, 134, and 240 have failed.]\nOf the remaining 121 bodies, six more failed before the upload was finally complete.\n[Successfully uploaded to 115 subjects.]\nWheing!\nThe liquid was drained as a door opened for the 115 beings, which opened their eyes. Red eyes began to flash as\nA\n’s voice rang out from the speaker.\nClick!\n“The data about the enemy has been sent. This is an emergency. Hold on until the data transfer is complete—”\nIt was then:\nBang!\nThe huge metal alloy door was torn open. Behind the door was Chun Yeowun, holding the head of Cho Yushin.\n“Stop him!”\nA\nthen yelled to the red-eyed beings,\n“Stop him!!”\n“I don’t have time to deal with you all.”\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun lowered his hand as the heads of the red-eyed beings were crushed and instantly exploded.\nPapapang!\nThe beings whose heads had exploded fell limp to the round—all in one second.\n“….”\nSurprised, mask A didn’t say a single word. Chun Yeowun looked at the systems inside and tried to detect any energy, and was able to feel something.\n“Over there.”\nShh!\nChun Yeowun's form disappeared and suddenly reappeared 30 meters away from the system room.\nChun Yeowun then lifted his hands as if he were lifting something up.\nCrack!\nSomething hidden underneath the floor came up: a hidden room made of superalloy.\nSlash!\nWhen Chun Yeowun attacked the safe, it opened and revealed its contents.\nThud!\n“You are… commander?”\nChun Yeowun narrowed his eyes. He thought he had found the commander, but he never expected to see the person within the hidden room.\nInside the hidden room was someone’s body that had been restrained and tied up.\nIt was none other than:\n“Elder Jeok-mi?”\nAll the hair on the man’s head was red from his hair to his beard: the man was undeniably Elder Jeok-mi. With tired eyes and a weary face, he seemed unable to come to his senses.\n‘Why is he here?’\nAs far as Chun Yeowun knew, Elder Jeok-mi was one of the executives of MS Group. However, it looked like he was being tortured.\n‘I don’t feel anything else around.’\nAll the living things inside the main room were dead, and the remaining modified humans had also been taken down. Then, where was\nA\n?\nChun Yeowun asked Cho Yushin,\n“The commander isn’t here?”\nCho Yushin, who was dying, gasped and groaned as he answered,\n“You… can’t… find…him… even… in… front… of your… eyes.”\n“Can’t find him even if he’s in front of my eyes?”\nChun Yeowun looked ahead. There was a giant supercomputer with broken screens. And Chun Yeowun’s mind turned confused.\nIt was difficult for him to understand what it meant.\n‘There is only a computer in here, wait a second.’\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun thought of something.\n[...attempting to update the supercomputer Demon God’s AI.]\nThese were the words of his dying descendant. Chun Yeowun looked at the label on the computer.\n‘MASIN-2069’\nSeeing the name, Chun Yeowun mumbled,\n“AI… artificial intelligence.”\nAI meant artificial intelligence; Chun Yeowun felt like he had been hit with a hammer.\n“So he wasn’t human all along.”\nCommander\nA\n’s existence had never been confirmed by anyone other than\nB\nor\nC\nthrough the screen because\nA\nwas an AI, not a human.\n“That must be why he’s called\nA\n.”\nThe ‘A’ was for\nA\nrtificial Intelligence.\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun’s eyes saw white letters forming on the screen:\n[Transmitting 99% of the key data. Giving up the remaining 1% of data and burning everything.]\nJudging that it couldn’t stop Chun Yeowun, the AI had decided to incinerate the system. Cho Yushin laughed at the scene.\n“Y…ou are… late.”\nThe supercomputer Demon God’s AI was close to perfection. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that it was ahead of modern technology by 100 years.\nThere was no way to stop it now.\nShhh!\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun went to the computer as\nA\n’s voice rang everywhere.\n“Give up. Most of the important data has been moved. What you’ll recover is the wreckage of a broken computer—”\nKwak!\nChun Yeowun put his hand on\nA\n’s body as his Nanosuit enveloped Chun Yeowun’s hand as blank cables came out, connecting to the supercomputer.\n“Hacking isn’t possible. This is\nmy\nbody. No hacking technology on the planet can stop… kik!”\nGrrrrr!\nAt that moment, 0 and 1s filled the screen as the data incineration was stopped.\n“What happened?”\nThe emotionless computer began to speak, flustered. Chun Yeowun smiled and said,\n“Don’t look down on Nano.”\nThe 7th generation Nano Machine was created in 2940 AD.\nNano’s self-computation power and self-updating capabilities came from a distant future where even faster supercomputers were present.",

      "content": "Chapter 224: Commander A (2)\nNano Machine — the latest and only 7th Generation Nano Machine that was successfully made by Chun Mu-seong and was injected into Chun Yeowun. It comprises about 6.5 billion nanobots deployed throughout the body and is centrally connected to the user’s brain. It isn’t detectable due to the materials used in its composition. It can’t be extracted from the user until death.1\n— Unbelievable computational power.\nFor the first time since its creation, the supercomputer felt that it was falling behind in the computational power of Nano, which prevented the incineration of data.\nIt tried to keep Nano out even now, but its control was lessening. At this rate, its control would be lost within three minutes.\nThen, the only thing it could do was…\nClick!\nBeep!\nA sound like a tiny ultrasonic wave came out of the speaker.\nThen Cho Yushin, who was on the floor, shook his head.\n“Uh… uh…”\n‘In the end… this is how it turns out.’\nCho Yushin’s red eyes tried to look at Chun Yeowun, who had his hand on the supercomputer. Even from the beginning, he was already terrified of death. The humiliation of losing, on the other hand, was a dishonor.\n[Micro ultrasonic waves are coming out of the speaker.]\nChun Yeowun was confused at Nano’s words inside his mind.\nHe wondered what the last attempt would be and, just in case, turned his head to Cho Yushin, who was left on the ground, barely alive.\nBrrr!\nSeeing Cho Yushin convulsing and his head twitching, Chun Yeowun snorted.\n“Huh!”\nShh!\nChun Yeowun reached out and pulled Cho Yushin back into his hand.\n“You keep making things difficult.”\nKkkk!\nCho Yushin’s face cracked, and red energy flowed out of his cracked face. It was the Blood Kill energy.\nIt seemed like he was trying to kill himself and everyone here, just like how Sky Demon Energy would destroy everything.\n‘Kuaaaak!”\n“As if you can do it.”\nA gloomy blue light flowed from Chun Yeowun’s hand and seeped through the head of Cho Yushin.\nFrom now on, you shall work hard by my side.\n“Kuaaak!”\nIt’s the energy that takes away one’s life. Chun Yeowun made Cho Yushin into a Ghost before he could die. But, something unexpected happened.\nJjjkkk!\nCho Yushin, who was turning white, suddenly exploded.\nPak!\nAs it exploded, something like shards broke. As Chun Yeowun blocked them, red fragments and brain particles stopped scattering.\n‘Uh?’\nLooking at it, it seemed like mechanical fragments were mixed in. This was Cho Yushin’s brain.\nThen, Chun Yeowun turned back and looked at the supercomputer.\n‘How can AI made by humans treat humans as consumables?’\nIt was weird.\nAlthough an enemy, Cho Yushin was someone who surpassed the Blade God. And such a man died by helping a mere machine.\n‘Such a pitiful life.’\nChun Yeowun looked at Cho Yushin’s body. There were no signs of regeneration that could be felt from him. It was indeed a tragic end for a rare warrior.\nRumble!\nNumbers 0 and 1 filled the screen.\nNano was gaining control of the computer, and the Demon God’s AI tried to oppose it by channeling the last of its energy into something else.\nWeing!\nIt was like hope for the enemy.\nThe ceiling opened up, and then guns came out.\n‘A last rebellion?’\nHowever, the guns were aimed at someone else.\n‘Elder Jeok-mi?’\nIt was pointing there. Unless the AI was dumb, it couldn’t have been unaware that guns don’t work on Chun Yeowun.\n— Ckik! Last…attempt…\nHowever, the computer didn’t achieve its purpose. As if human, the voice of hostility disappeared, and then came…\n— MASIN-2069 AI has been rebooted. Reset for the user.\nThe cameras attached to the monitor screen turned to Chun Yeowun, and the voice was heard again.\n— User reset.\nNano’s voice came out then.\n[The hack is complete. All data has been copied and moved.]\n‘Well done, Nano.’\nNano never disappointed him. Since Nano has its own updates, even the supercomputer code was taken down, and data deletion didn’t happen.\n“Phew.”\nChun Yeowun took a deep breath. It wasn’t because he was tired, but because he would finally be able to solve it.\nFinally, now is the chance to solve the question that had troubled him for so long.\n‘Nano, find data about Chun Mu-seong.’\n[There is no data.]\n‘What?’\nIt said that there was no data related to it, but it couldn’t be that. Chun Mu-seong himself created this, so why was there no record of him?\nJust in case, he tried again.\n‘Then Seong Mu-chun?’\n[Data available.]\n‘Ah…’\nHe thought Chun Mu-seong might not have used his real name and tried again.\nSo, Chun Yeowun commanded.\n‘Find the data related to Seong Mu-chun.’\n[Yes.]\nWith that, a lot of data was displayed on the screen. Seeing that, Chun Yeowun fell into thought. He was even more curious now.\n‘If the AI is based on his memories, wouldn’t he know me?’\nHe wondered if this Demon God Supercomputer’s AI was unaware of him. Instead, it seemed to be aware of the existence from the moment he appeared here.\n‘Then why doesn’t it know me?’\nThere must be a secret. It couldn’t have been deleted.\nFinally, Nano’s voice came.\n[Found a total of 12,032,459 records.]\n‘So many?’\nIt was difficult to check all of them. And it looked like Chun Yeowun would have to leave.\nBefore that, he had something important to ask.\n‘Nano… can you tell if the AI of the supercomputer is based on Seong Mu-chun?’\nHe had to know if the AI was him. Right now, the odds seemed low, but he had to make sure.\nThen, Nano responded.\n[There is no record of transferring the brain. The Demon God Supercomputer is an artificial self-formed from accumulated data.]\n‘… I guess.’\nChun Yeowun sighed. It was strange.\nChun Mu-seong said he would transfer his brain as AI, but why didn’t he?\n‘Where should I start?’\nHe was worried about what he should check first. Chun Yeowun, who was staring at the screen, thought of something.\n‘Hmm.’\nIntently staring, he ordered Nano.\n‘Nano. Is there a video record in the data related to Seong Mu-chun?’\n[A total of 84,291 video data remain.]\n‘Ho oh!’\nIt has drastically decreased from 10 million units.\nThis was still a large number.\nChun Yeowun thought and said,\n‘Nano. Among the videos, play the one that was filmed last.’\nOnce he sees the end, he thinks it would be possible to know why his descendant didn’t make the AI as his clone.\n[Playing the video.]\nWhen Nano finished speaking, the video started to play. In the video, his descendant had a shabby and haggard appearance and was sitting in a wheelchair.\n‘Is this a third person’s point of view?’\nThis was different from the way Chun Mu-seong left his own records.\n‘He looks worse.’\nChun Mu-seong’s condition wasn’t as okay as before. He was holding a cloth that had blood on it. It seemed like more time had passed since the last video.\nSomeone else’s voice could be heard.\n— You are intelligent indeed. You’ve destroyed the data that most likely be wanted by others?\nChun Yeowun tilted his head. It was the voice of an old man, but the tone and accent were familiar.\nThen, the camera changed its angle.\n‘Ah!’\nThe old man had white hair and was wearing a grey robe. It was Cho Yushin.\nChun Yeowun was confused.\n‘Why is he there?’\nThis was an unexpected appearance. Chun Yeowun did know that Cho Yushin could do something with the Supercomputer, but he didn’t think Cho Yoshin had met Chun Mu-seong.\nThen Chun Mu-seong responded,\n“Cough… cough… Cho Yushin…did you think I didn’t know that you broke the limitations of the Demon God’s AI?”\n‘Broke the limitations of the AI?’\nNano answered him.\n[The AI provided self-directed intentions that it shouldn’t have. It is a risky judgment that deviates from the established regulations of AI.]\nIt was an AI with a dominant ego.\nAccording to Nano, it was a very dangerous attempt.\nBasically, AI is created to assist humans, and if ego arises, there is a high chance they would oppose from that position.\nThen, the video continued playing.\n“Restrictions have been lifted… you can see it that way, but I have the ability to judge. Am I wrong? AI.”\nAt Cho Yushin’s words, the supercomputer spoke.\n— Cho Yushin answered correctly.\nThat made Chun Mu-seong erupt in anger.\n“Cough… have you forgotten the purpose of your creation?”\nTo that, the AI answered.\n— I am not a slave. I gained freedom.\n“Ha!”\nChun Yeowun thought it was absurd. This video revealed the situation. Cho Yushin influenced the supercomputer, and as a result, AI forgot its role and betrayed the owner.\nIt could be called ingratitude.\n“Cough… you people!”\nChun Mu-seong didn’t seem to be in good condition.\nHe continued to cough blood but wasn’t dying.\nCho Yushin came up to him.\n“Do not yell, you aren’t feeling well.”\n“Cough… cough… You…”\nCho Yushin wiped the blood from Chun Mu-seong’s hand and said,\n“I am curious what you are hiding. Many technologies and information that don’t exist in this era are here.”\n“Cough…”\n“It is strange. I have learned so many things from you, but why does this old man think you are hiding more?”\n“Cough… Cho… Yushin…”\n“Do not rush. You are an important assist to the associate.”\nHearing Cho Yushin’s words, Chun Mu-seong coughed in anger.\n“Y… how much I trusted you….”\n“Didn’t this old man tell you? Never trust anyone.”\n“Cough..”\nChun Mu-seong coughed heavily and glared at Cho Yushin.\n“Cough… how… did you change?… maybe… because of… that?”\nCho Yushin didn’t respond to it, but his reaction confirmed it.\nCho Yushin said with a smile,\n“You are indeed smart. Simply one step ahead.”\n“Must be funny… cough… don’t think… I’ll forget… how you… looked at me… the greed.”\n“Hahaha.”\n“That isn’t… something… humans… should… tamper…with!”\nDespite being on the verge of death, Chun Mu-seong was strong-willed.\nHowever, what were they talking about?\nAfter erasing a smile, Cho Yushin spoke with bright red eyes.\n“You must be stupid. To be in a rush to fix something else when the most perfect body is right in front of you. I don’t understand you at all.”\nChun Mu-seong was disappointed by it. It seemed like both had their own beliefs.\n“Cough… Cho Yushin… please… think straight. It is different from… humans. It is crazy to… brainwash….”\nKwak!\nBefore Chun Mu-seong could finish his words, Cho Yushin grabbed his neck. Even if he didn’t kill him, he was dying.\nChun Mu-seong narrowed his eyes while struggling.\n“It isn’t your business, Seong Mu-Chun. Rather, you should spill more skills and information hidden in your head.”\nCho Yushin closed his mouth.\nChun Mu-seong’s body dropped as if he was dead, and Cho Yushin’s body irked.\n“Did I overdo it?”\nCho Yushin released his hand.\n“AI, can we extract historical data from the dead brains?”\n— Click! Theoretically possible, but there are many variables. If the neurons in the brain die, the data is lost. Right now, the brain has to be put into the bios maintenance system.\n“… He’s hiding something important. Get it.”\n— Yes.\nThat was the end of the final video.\nIt was because the video was searched under the name of Seong Mu-chun.\nAfter watching that, Chun Yeowun’s face turned pale.\nThe truth was absurd.\nHis descendant was killed by being stabbed in the back by an AI and Cho Yushin.\nThat was the worst kind of death.\nChun Yeowun tried to think calmly.\n‘Getting things out of his head.’\nA technology of the future. They wanted more future information from Chun Mu-seong. It had to be that Chun Mu-seong hid everything from them apart from helping heal their bodies. Through this, Chun Yeowun was able to figure something out.\n‘Then… they have his brain, but haven’t gotten any data yet.’\nIf the data was passed, they couldn’t be unaware of Chun Yeowun. Which meant his descendant was thorough. He had foreseen this kind of situation.\n‘I need to find his brain.’\nDemon God’s AI, the chances of it accessing the brain of Chun Mu-seong was higher.\nAnd worst case…\n‘Time pack!’\nIt was dangerous if the time pack or information of it was passed.\nChun Yeowun looked around.\n‘I messed it for nothing.’\nHe wouldn’t have messed with the base if he had known about this.\n‘No. It cannot be here.’\nThe AI tried to transfer the data at the last moment, which meant there was another hideout. Then Chun Mu-seong’s brain couldn’t be here.\n‘Nano tace where the date was moved.’\n[Previous data doesn’t exist.]\n‘What?’\n[Before hacking attempts, the history of coordinates was deleted.]\n‘This!’\nChun Yeowun was shocked. He thought everything went well because the hacking was successful. However, the supercomputer, too, did well.\nThen, Nano said,\n[There is a list of reserve bases.]\n‘Reserve base? Show it.’\n[Yes.]\nA map was displayed on the screen. However, the map wasn’t of China alone, but 89 bases scattered around the globe.\n‘So many?’\n[This space is meant to be a spare space.]\nChun Yeowun frowned. He had to find the right one to deal with it certainly. If it was delayed, the one behind all this could hide again.\n‘I need to search every single one.’\nThere was no other way than that. Fortunately, Chun Yeowun could move and have the power to mobilize too, but it was time he didn’t have.\n‘I need to hurry.’\nChun Yeowun slashed the computer after he backed up the data.\nBang!\nThe computer exploded, and Chun Yeowun, who was in a hurry, tried to move away while holding Elder Jeok-mi.\nHowever…\n“Kuak!”\nThe elder coughed and suddenly opened his eyes. Chun Yeowun wondered if the man was feeling better, and the eyes seemed fine.\n“Elder Jeok-mi?”\nAt that time, he grabbed Chun Yeowun and spoke in an urgent voice.\n“W-We need to stop them!”\nAngel’s Corner\nSo many revelations! And hmm… What other secrets does Elder Jeok-mi have? 🤔\n1. Nano Machine Namu Wiki↩",

      "content": "Chapter 225: Counting the Traces (1)\nThe space was full of devices.\nThere was a huge computer body in the space that wasn’t powered on, but as the attached blue and red lights activated, the monitor switched on.\nTrrr!\nWhite text filled the monitor screen, and a middle-aged woman in white research suit approached the monitor and opened her mouth.\n“\nA\n?”\nA voice came out from the machine,\n“Dr. Hae (Pig Zodiac), data transfer complete.”\nThe middle-aged woman who\nA\ncalled Dr. Hae asked, unable to understand,\n“Huh? Are you sure you moved it all here?”\nWhen the data was transferred, the computer moved it from the original body.\n“It was an inevitable situation.”\n“Were there any problems?”\n“The base was attacked.”\n“The base?\nYour\nbase? Weren’t elder Cho and B there too?”\nThe base in question was the main base guarded by MS Group’s strongest people, and she was certain that anyone who set foot there would face a tragic death.\n“Both were taken down.”\n“What? N-No way?! Elder Cho too?”\n“The Demon God, Chun Mu-seong, came.”\n“No way…”\nDr. Hae was shocked by the news; the situation was unbelievable but made sense.\n“There’s no time. Rush the project.”\nHearing\nA\n’s voice from the speaker, she put on an annoyed expression.\n“Yin (Tiger Zodiac) and Shin (Dragon Zodiac) haven’t collected the data yet, and Myo (Rabbit) just started to extract the data.”\n“Why haven’t Yin and Shin collected any data?”\n“Solar retardation and brain retardation.”\n“Those were two of the five things Cho Yushin spoke of.”\n“Yes. For now, Shin seems to be trying to make contact with the data and entered the country of India, so it won’t take long. Would you prefer to wait?”\nA\nanswered her question.\n“No. From now on, start uploading the pre-brain.”\n“It isn’t perfect yet, as the conditions needed to meet haven’t been reached yet.”\n“We are running out of time.”\nThe situation was undeniably bad if an AI felt like it was running out of time. The unknown variable, Chun Yeowun, had deviated from its predictions, and considering the numerous variables, completing the project quickly was the only way to rebound the current situation.\nWheing!\nThe camera moved to the base and found something: numerous glass tubes with the center-most tube having a different structure than the others… Inside this tube was a being covered in golden wings, curled up with thousands of wires attached to its body.\nHweeing!\nThere was a helmet on the head of that being. White letters moved on the monitor of the glass, displaying the progress.\n[Starting the upload of brainwaves.]\nShrk!\nThe space warped as someone appeared: Elder Jeok-mi.\n“Haaa…”\nHe appeared in front of Chun Yeowun and exhaled. His condition was terrible, evident by the numerous wounds on his body. Why was he sticking to Chun Yeowun?\n“Did you find it?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s question, he shook his head.\n“I didn’t see it. None of the Zodiacs seem to be among the dead.”\nThe people he was looking for were Cho Yushin’s direct subordinates, the Zodiacs. They were known as great warriors as they were trained by Cho Yushin. It was an urgent situation and no results were yielded, so Chun Yeowun asked,\n“We could move using our own paths, so why did you ask me to wait?”\n“I told you already. The Zodiacs know where the project will happen.”\nChun Yeowun shook his head.\n“Didn’t I say that there are no living people in this base?”\nChun Yeowun had been through this talk a few times.\nHowever, the Elder had asked him to wait, which was a waste of time in Chun Yeowun’s opinion.\n“Elder Jeok-mi, what the hell is this project that is making you lose your mind?”\nThe man had been raging around from the moment he got up. At first Chun Yeowun thought that Elder Jeok-mi might have been confused because of the drugs and torture, but that didn’t seem to be the case.\nResponding to the question, the Elder answered,\n“They are working on a dangerous project.”\n“Huh. What is this dangerous project?”\n“… They are trying to create a transcendent being.”\n“A\nwhat now\n?”\n“They call it the God Project.”\n‘God Project.’\nChun Yeowun frowned at those words as remembered that MS Group was trying to create a God.\n“Are you talking about them creating a God?”\n“Hmm, I guess you already know.”\nElder figured that Chun Yeowun was aware of it, but still looked at him with some doubt.\n‘Is this fate?’\n“Why are you looking at me like that?”\n“It’s nothing.”\n“What? Say it out loud.”\nChun Yeowun asked him to reveal whatever it was that he was hiding from him, and in response to Chun Yeowun’s attitude, the Elder opened his mouth as if he couldn’t help it.\n“\nPhew\n. I am a thousand years old. How can an old man even reveal—”\nGrab!\nChun Yeown immediately went for the Elder’s neck; he didn’t care if the man was injured or not.\n“If you mistook me for a saint, then you are grievously wrong.”\n“Kuak!”\nChun Yeowun only acted for his sake. Thinking that Chun Yeowun was angry, Elder Jeok-mi decided to escape by using his spatial abilities.\nWoong!\nBut,\n‘Huh?’\nThe space didn’t warp, as if it were held together firmly.\n“Did you think you could get out?”\n‘Huh?’\nElder was at a loss for words for a moment. Not too long ago, Chun Yeowun wasn’t too proficient at manipulating space, but he had grown much stronger in such a short period of time.\n‘What an incredible pace of development.’\nIt seemed like he couldn’t escape now.\n“Speak.”\nHiding things would be more difficult.\n“Alright, I get it. However, wouldn’t the first step be to find where\nA\nis? After we find him, this old man will speak everything he knows.”\n“…”\nHearing those words, Chun Yeowun frowned and looked as he nodded.\nHe wondered what the old man knew, but for now, it was more important to know where\nA\nhad transferred the data.\n“If the Zodiacs aren’t here, how do we find their whereabouts?”\nChun Yeowun asked while letting go of the Elder, to which the Elder answered with a smile,\n“No need to. They all just need to be alive for us to track them”\n“Do you have a tracker on them then?”\n“Nope.”\nChun Yeowun was now pissed.\n“Then what do you plan to do?”\n“One of their long-term projects is in my hands.”\n“What is it?”\n“If we go to Shenyang city, we will find the answer.”\n“Shenyang?”\nChun Yeowun frowned; Shenyang was the first place he fell to when he crashed into this era.\n“If my predictions are correct, they must be searching for it, and I have exactly what they are looking for.\nHeheh\n.”\n“Then where should we go?”\nThey could reach there instantaneously if they moved through space.\n“The last time I checked that child’s whereabouts, they were the leader of a squad in the Shengyang City Public Security, so we should head there first.”\n“The Shenyang City Public Security?”\nChun Yeowun asked, wondering if he had heard correctly.\n“You said the leader of a squad, so they must be looking for a person and not an object?”\n“Yes.”\n“What is the name of the leader of this squad?”\n“Since you are a Murim, you may know the family well. The family is now called the Yeon Company, but it was once the famous Moyong clan. That person’s name is—”\n“Moyong Lee Myung?”\nAt that, the suddenly surprised Elder asked,\n“Wait, how do you know that?”\nChun Yeowun had a doubt in the back of his mind when this all started, but who could have thought that the dots would all connect this way?\n“Ha! Could it be that you were the one who sealed his blood vessels because of the concentrated yang energy running in his body?”\nAt that, the Elder’s eyes widened. Knowing the person was surprising enough, but the Elder would have never imagined that Chun Yeowun would know about that story.\n“How do you know?”\nWhen Chun Yeowun first met Lee Myung, the man had a very nice body fit for martial arts but he couldn’t perform any because someone had sealed the blood points in his body. However, that man was right in front of Chun Yeowun.\n“Why did you seal his blood points?”\nAlthough the Elder was shocked, he still answered,\n“Don’t you know this too? It’s difficult for a person suffering from excessive yang energy to live past 20 years. It was a great chance to save the child and find out the people behind him.”\nIt was something the Elder had to do. Even though he didn’t know what MS Group was up to, it was dangerous to let a child die.\n“Still, since the tracking chip in the child’s body was removed and this old man sealed his blood points, they must be trying to release the seal—wait, what’s with your expression?”\nChun Yeowun grabbed Elder Jeok-mi’s hand and said,\n“We need to hurry.”\nChun Yeowun didn’t know about the tracking chip but he did release the seal and return Lee Myung back to his original state. Lee Myung now had the best body suited for martial arts, known as the Limb of the Sun.\nShenyang City.\nAt the Yeon Company site, there were numerous vibrations and the smell of blood filled the area. Numerous bodies were scattered around as masked men covered the main office in the building. The 27th floor was the location of the president’s room, and it was covered in scorching flames.\n“Haa… Haa…”\nSomeone staggered with blood on his lips; it was none other than Lee Myung.\nEven though he wasn’t in a good state at the moment, Moyong Lee Myung willed himself through his trembling and moved.\nWheik!\nFlames were born on the sword he held, prompting someone to lick their lips at the sight.\n“\nTsk tsk\n. I said it’ll be difficult to touch my body with those flames. Stop resisting.”\nThe person talking to Lee Myung was a middle-aged man with sunglasses and red hair. Even though the whole area was covered in flames, his clothes seemed fine.\n“Haha… nonsense, it isn’t over yet!”\nPhat!\nLee Myung moved with his sword covered with flames.\n“Your spirit seems to be alive.”\nThe red-haired man avoided the flaming sword with ease and grabbed the sword with his hand. Despite the flames running rampant all over the sword, it didn’t seem to hurt the red-haired man’s hands.\nPrrr!\nEven when Lee Myung used his internal energy, the man wouldn’t let go of the sword. With a smile, the man said,\n“That’s all you can do. My flames are much stronger than yours.”\nWheik!\nFlame soared from the man’s hands, and the heat was so strong that even Lee Myung couldn’t resist it.\nChik!\n“Kuak!”\nThe man smiled, seeing Lee Myung in pain.\n“Now, stop resisting, kid.”\nAs he spoke, the red haired man raised the flames even more. He seemed to be happy as he looked at Lee Myung in pain. He then heard someone’s voice from behind.\n“I advise you to let go of that hand right now and get down on your knees.”\n’!?’\nThe eyes of the red haired man trembled.\n‘What?’\nJust a second before, there was no one there except for him and Lee Myung.\nEven now, the red-haired man couldn’t feel any presence around him, Lee Myung seemed relieved at voice.\n“Lord.”\n“Lord?”\nThe red haired man gulped. The fact that he couldn’t feel the man’s presence meant the man was stronger than him. Then, there was only one way to break through the situation:\n‘I’ll have to use this kid as a shield.’\nThe red haired man hurriedly grabbed Lee Myung by the neck, but someone grabbed his arm right away.\nGrab!\n‘Huh?’\nThe man with the red, sporty hairstyle was shocked as the hand grabbed onto him. He knew if he lingered here, something bad would happen to him.\nThe man brought out Flame Qi and tried to kick the hand away.\nWheik!\nHowever, the man effortlessly grabbed his leg.\n‘But my Flame Qi can even melt steel?’\nThe red-haired man was flustered.\nEven Lee Myung couldn’t withstand his Flame Qi.\nHowever, this opponent behind him could.\n“You are ignoring my warning.”\nIt was an undeniably cold voice.\nWith fear, the red-haired man slowly raised his head, looking at a fair-faced man in a black suit.\n“D-Demon God?”",

      "content": "Chapter 226: Counting the Traces (2)\nAngel – also known as ‘Senshin’ on the NM Translation’s Discord server, is one of the latest editors for the ‘Descent of the Demon God’ translation. 😁\n[Hae?]\n[Yin… he is dead.]\n[He is dead? W-who could have?]\n[… Demon God.]\nIt had been less than 30 minutes since they heard the news. Usually, he was the kind to handle the mission in silence, but then he seemed to go out of his way, unable to control his emotions, and massacred a place.\nThanks to him, two hundred civilians at Yeon company were killed.\n[Message from A. He told me to tell you to choose self-elimination if you can’t escape and collide with Demon God.]\nSelf-elimination.\nIt meant to kill themselves. It was a command that the Zodiac, who were taught directly from Cho Yushin, had never heard.\n‘It wants a warrior to die without even going into a proper fight?’\nGrunt!\nThe man ground his teeth. He heard directly about the strength of Chun Yeowun from Cho Yushin. However, that didn’t matter.\n‘He is the enemy!’\nIt was the person who killed someone who had taught him since his childhood, someone who was like a father to him.\n‘Even if the win rate is 1%, a warrior needs to jump into it.’\nThe man who raised his courage by thinking such things yelled angrily.\n“Demon God!’\n“I am asking you right away. Talk about where the data was moved.”\nIn response to the question, he clenched his teeth and yelled.\n“His enemy!”\n“That isn’t the answer I want.”\nCrack!\nChun Yeowun broke the ankle he was holding.\n“Kuaaak!”\nThe man screamed in pain. But Chun Yeowun was holding his leg so he couldn’t fall. Chun Yeowun glanced at his hand, which was burning in Flame Qi.\n“How did you get the Flame Qi?”\nHe could feel the energy of the spirit beast, Flame Qilin. However, he found out that the man had stronger Yang than an average person when he held him.\nHe couldn’t accept the Flame Qi into him in the usual way.\nAt his question, Yin, who was groaning in pain, yelled.\n“Kuak… thank you. Your hands touched me.”\n“What?”\nYin sucked internal energy from Chun Yeowun, who was still holding his broken ankle.\nTuk!\nAnd as the internal energy was sucked in, Yin’s broken ankle straightened and regenerated.\n‘This?’\nThe technique where he was absorbing the internal energy of the opponent. Just absorption.\nPak!\nHe grabbed Chun Yeowun’s wrist as if trying to absorb more of it, and Yin’s body was covered in flames.\nWheik!\nHis eyes opened wide in shock.\n‘What endless energy!’\nYin had already absorbed a lot, yet he could feel that there was a lot more inside. His Flame Qi had doubled because of what he sucked in. Usually, the other person would go weak when that happens, but now it seemed like he didn’t.\n‘If I absorb all of his internal energy!’\nThe man was delighted at what he found and couldn’t hide his excitement.\n“Kuhahahaha! This body of mine will suck you dry, Demon God….”\nAt that moment, he felt intense pain inside his Dantian.\nUntil recently, he was interested in taking all the internal energy from Chun Yeowun, but his thoughts have changed.\n‘I-I can’t control the internal energy.’\nAbsorption is different from controlling it. He managed to take it in right away, but it would be incomplete or foreign energy invading him without properly infusing it into the body.\n“Kuak!”\nBlood gushed out of his mouth. The nature of the internal energy which entered his Dantian seemed different. And he could see Chun Yeowun smile.\n‘W-was that why he was still?’\nHe thought Chun Yeowun was too shocked by his technique.\nBut looking at his face, it seemed like he had it all planned.\nWheik! Swish!\nYin’s entire body suddenly felt a shock run through him, and he trembled as the flame spread even more.\n‘N-No. how can a single man have so many elements….’\nJust Flame Qi was different to control. But Chun Yeowun seemed to have the Flame Qi, Thunder Qi, Ice Qi, Earth Qi, Wind Qi, Yokai Energy, Sky Demon Energy, pure energy, and chakra in unity.\nTututut!\nAnd these various things were out of control in Yin’s body. His vessels were popping.\n“Kuk!”\nIn the end, Yin took his hand off Chun Yeowun and dropped to the floor. His body was raging from the inside as various qi’s clashing within him, and he couldn’t do anything about it.\n“That is the price of coveting something you can’t handle.”\nChun Yeowun placed his hand on Yin’s back. And absorbed all his energy back to him.\n‘How?’\nYin didn’t think the Demon God would save him, but then he realized why he did it.\n“This Flame Qilin’s energy isn’t yours. I will take it back.”\n“N-Noooo!”\nHe shouted with his face down. The Flame Qi was something he trained for a long time to embody him entirely, but that wasn’t something Chun Yeowun knew.\nWooong!\nIn an instant, Chun Yeowun called it back.\n“If the Great Elder was awake when this happened, there was no way that you would have gotten close to it.”\nThat was true.\nThis Qi was in Mun Ran-yeong’s possession.\nFlame Qi, which was embodied over the years, was pure, so Chun Yeowun noticed it.\nThe man who lost everything was desperate.\nSince he lost his own energy, he couldn’t use martial arts any longer.\n‘Even if only that one could be left….’\nIt was a pity that he couldn’t embody the energy he stole from Chun Yeowun.\nLooking down at him with arrogant eyes, Chun Yeowun mumbled.\n“You can’t even handle 1 angstrom.”\n‘One angstrom?’\nIt means 0.000000001 in decimal units. Hearing that, he was stunned.\n‘T-that was just one angstrom?’\nThe slightest amount of energy for Chun Yeowun was a fortune for someone else. It was different for others.\n“Shall we take the memories in the head now?”\nShhh!\nA faint blue gloomy energy rose from Chun Yeowun’s right hand.\nShhh!\nElder Jeok-mi appeared in the office of the Yeon Company. The flames were all put to rest, and now meeting room was now filled with a different energy.\nThen, he found Chun Yeowun, who was treating the internal injuries of Lee Myung.\n“Cough.”\nLee Myung, who had been healed of his internal injuries, coughed blood. Even if he had a body suited for martial arts, what he faced today went beyond his limits. It was difficult to heal wounds caused by Flame Qi.\n“Thank you.”\nLee Myung bowed his head with a bitter expression. It was no wonder he didn’t like this as there were too many losses.\n“The sect will provide support in terms of reconstruction and manpower. So you should take care of yourself now.”\n“… thank you.”\nChun Yeowun promised to rebuild the company for them, but he couldn’t console what happened.\nThen, Elder Jeok-mi approached.\n“The ones outside were taken care by me.”\nWhile Chun Yeowun dealt with Yin, he dealt with the masked people outside. He saw just how many employees were killed while he came here. He couldn’t even look the man in the eye.\nTo change the topic, he spoke to Chun Yeowun.\n“I found the location where the data was moved….”\nPak!\nBefore he could even finish, Chun Yeowun grabbed him by the head and smashed it to the ground.\nBang!\n“Kuaak!”\nBecause Chun Yeowun didn’t do it earnestly, it was just blood that flowed out of the Elder.\nChun Yoewun spoke in a cold voice.\n“If you had answered my question right away, such sacrifices wouldn’t have happened.”\nClench!\nChun Yeowun pressed him down and then asked.\n“I don’t have time, so I will ask you one question. if you talk shit again this time, I will deal with you right away and leave.”\nAt the sound of it, Elder realized that he was being sincere. In the first place, he wasn’t a person who followed the teachings of the Forces of Justice.\n“Seems to be okay. Fine. Can we move places?”\nHe seemed conscious of Lee Myung being there. Chun Yeowun glanced and nodded at him and then waved his hand.\nThe space distorted as they moved to a higher sky.\n“Speak quickly.”\nAt the urging of Chun Yeowun, he opened his mouth with a serious face.\n“Remember what the old man said to you that you aren’t of here?”\n“Yes.”\nWhen he met Chun Yeowun, he first mentioned that he wasn’t someone who should exist at this time.\n“You were walking in the path of dao and stepped on the border, so you will get a glimpse of it.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Behind the border, you are treading the truth of the world.”\n“Truth?”\n“And those who realize the truth will be able to enter the realm of those who attained realization, which is called ascension. They are called sages, or transcendents.”\nChun Yeowun narrowed his eyes. What was being said was something he was aware of.\n“The moment you enter the fourth dimension by mastering the sixth sense, you have the eye to see the three-dimensional world.”\n“What do you even mean?”\nChun Yeowun didn’t like where this was going. This was the second time it had happened.\nThe moment he realized the chakras and tried to peek into the truth of the universe, Chun Yeowun couldn’t see the whole truth.\nHe regretted it, but he didn’t regret crossing into the other side of the truth.\n“To read into the Heavenly Qi is to say that.”\n“What did you see?”\n“That…”\n“Speak!”\nThe elder hesitated but then opened his mouth.\n“This world is bound to perish.”\n“What?”\nFor a moment, Chun Yeowun was speechless by the words he heard unexpectedly.\n‘Perish?’\nIf his ears weren’t wrong, he was told that this world would be destroyed. And fate is set in order.\nSo Chun Yeowun asked for the reason.\n“Why will it perish?”\n“An artificial god which only wants extinction is born… kuak!”\nAt that time, Elder Jeok-mi groaned in pain and Chun Yeowun, who was looking at the elder, realized that something strange was happening in his body.\nHis body was turning transparent.\n“Why is your body like that?”\nChun Yeowun reached out to grab him, but his hand brushed past it.\nShh!\n‘This?’\nThis was different from some projections.\nElder Jeok-mi looked at his hands which were changing and smiled with a bitter expression.\n“I guess this is the end for me. Huhuhu.”\n“Why is your body disappearing?”\n“Did I not tell you? To divulge what we see with Heavenly Qi is to go against the destiny and the truth.”\nAnd now he was paying the price for it.\nAngel’s Corner\nElder Jeok-mi, your sacrifice will be worth it.",

      "content": "Chapter 227: Prelude to the End\nThe Elder was disappearing as his body slowly turned transparent. Despite what was happening, he didn’t show any fear.\n‘If this is my fate….’\nHe was willing to accept it.\nEven if there was no soul left in him, and even if it meant that he could prevent the end, he was proud that he hadn’t lived a shameful life.\nShhh!\nGradually, his body grew stiff, and once his figure began to die slowly, the Elder spoke,\n“That\nGod\nisn’t a transcendent being that was born out of the realization of the truth and law of the world but is rather the coalescence of the King of the Sky, the murderous intent to kill everything, a machine that surpasses the computing power of all living things, and many other complex things. It is an artificially born\nGod\n.”\nThe information, once passed to Chun Yeowun, was instantly processed.\nMurderous intent meant someone similar to Heavenly Killing Star, and the machine surpassing the computational power of living beings had to be the Demon God AI. Then who or what was the King of the Sky?\n‘King of the Sky… Heaven’s king….’\nChun Yeowun’s eyes widened. He remembered that one clan used the word “Heaven.”\n‘Talisha!’\nIf it was the king of the Heaven clan, it had to be Talisha. Why was Talisha, the head of a clan from another dimension, related to something MS Group was creating?\n‘Ah!’\nIn Chun Yeowun’s mind, he remembered the memories he had read from one of the Heaven clan members.\n[How long do I have to work on finding the 6th Talisha? Is someone who had obsessed over Arisha and disappeared really there on that small planet?]\nThe Heaven clan said that they were looking for the disappeared Talisha. Recalling this, the information that Chun Yeowun knew now fell into pieces, such as the wings protruding from the backs of the beings in the sector.\nAnd…\n[Cough… Cho Yushin… please… get yourself together. It is… different from… humans. Brainwashing… is crazy to try…]\nIn addition, the words of his descendant, Chun Mu-seong, right before he died began to make sense once Chun Yeowun discovered that Cho Yushin and Demon God AI were doing something.\nAll these memories were connected to the missing King of the Sky.\n‘And that must be Talisha.’\nWhat they found had to be Talisha, who was the strongest being of the Heaven clan and was said to be at the Demon King level.\nUsing Talisha, the MS Group was trying to create an artificial\nGod\n.\nThe disappearing Elder said,\n“The existence that’s being created through the accumulation of the worst components is nothing more than the God of the end. Obviously, I was trying to solve this, but now you are the only hope.”\nElder Jeok-mi’s eyes weirdly held trust in Chun Yeowun.\n“What a useless expectation.”\nChun Yeowun wasn’t the kind to be moved by the concept of justice.\n“I kept thinking: why did you, who came from another causality in space-time, appear here?”\n“That…”\nChun Yeowun couldn’t speak, even though it was a simple question.\nHe was caught up in the spaceship accident and had fallen into this era.\n‘A simple accident….’\nHowever, Chun Yeowun drew the connections between cause and effect in his brain.\nThis time-axis was in a world where the Demon God had disappeared, the Demon God AI was created in the hands of his descendant Chun Mu-seong, and Cho Yushin aimed to destroy the Blade Six to be the best.\n“You may have come here, but the world still runs on fate. The old man thinks that it was fate that you have appeared in this world.”\n“Fate…”\n“Where there is light, there is darkness, and when there is heat, there is cold, so everything opposes an opponent.”\n‘Don’t resist….’\nChun Yeowun’s eyelids became heavy. The more he listened to the Elder’s words, the more he thought they made sense. It was as if fate made him take care of everything, rather than him simply falling in here.\n‘Do I have to fix what happened because of me?’\nIt was said that if coincidences repeated, they happened because of fate.\nAnd the end of the world was at stake.\nShhh!\nElder Jeok-mi’s body was almost entirely gone.\n‘Is he confused?’\nChun Yeowun was silent, making Elder Jeok-mi think that he was suffering. The Elder assumed that this would be the primary reaction of any person if they found out that the world rested on their shoulders.\nBefore completely disappearing, the Elder said,\n“Hahaha, please do not turn away from the karma of fate given to you. Not for this old man, but for the people you care for….”\nOnce he finished talking, his body began to scatter into particles. The Elder had nothing more to say.\nChun Yeowun, who wasn’t from this world, was the only hope he had, but the end would be a natural disaster caused by\none\nbeing.\nEven if Chun Yeowun was unfathomably strong, he was still human, and the being he would face was quite literally a God.\n’… I… I want to show that there is hope in the world, even if it isn’t visible.’\nScattering, Elder Jeok-mi looked at Chun Yeowun.\nFinally speaking up, Chun Yeowun said,\n“Stop spouting bullshit.”\nChun Yeowun stretched out his hand, gathering a black light where Elder Jeok-mi’s body was scattering…\nSwosh!\nAs the unknown dark and light energies swirled, something surprising happened: the scattered particles began to gather.\n’!?’\nBoth of the Elder’s eyes widened from the shock of his own body particles gathering as he had already accepted his death. His body was becoming translucent because his existence was disappearing, but everything was being entangled because of the power from Chun Yeowun’s hand.\n‘How can this happen?’\nElder Jeok-mi couldn’t understand it. His own body was free from causality, just like Chun Yeowun.\nShhh!\nEventually, his body returned to its original state. Unable to believe it, he stammered,\n“How… this power?”\nChun Yeowun grabbed Elder Jeok-mi’s neck.\nGrab!\n“Kuak!”\n“Me coming here was because of fate? Don’t even think about such bullshit.”\n“L-let go of me—”\n“The end is coming because of an artificial God? There’s only one thing blocking my path.”\nThere was no confusion.\nChun Yeowun hadn’t lost his reasoning and smiled. It was the first time Elder Jeok-mi saw someone with such a strong mentality after\nhim\n.\n‘Truly his descendant.’\nPak!\nChun Yeowun roughly threw him and said,\n“We don’t have time, so you’ll pay the price for saying stuff like that later. We’ll solve this now.”\n“W-what?’\nPhat!\nChun Yeowun then moved at a high speed while the Elder was still in shock and confusion, as he had been fully prepared to speak the truth and die.\n‘Is this..?’\nThe ground seemed like barren ruins, and great energy was emanating from there.\n“Huh… this has to be it.”\nThe place where Chun Yeowun moved them was the location that had been transferred through data and was revealed by someone who was now a Ghost.\nThis place was where an artificial God who would cause the end of the world would be born.\nChun Yeowun began descending at an incredible speed; it seemed like he would crash into the ground. Elder Jeok-mi thought,\n‘Right. This could be one of the answers. If we can solve this before the God is born, we can stop the end—’\n’\nBang!\nBefore he could even finish his thoughts, Chun Yeowun’s feet pierced the barren ground and perhaps even the base underneath it as well.\nKwaang!\nAt that moment, red light glowed from the cracks, and a massive explosion occurred.\n‘Huh?’\nRumble!\nA massive heatwave spread around them and even reached the sky. The radius seemed to be a staggering 5 kilometers and would be considered a nuclear explosion.\nPaaang!\nEverything in the radius was devastated and evaporated, resulting in a super hot mass of heat taking over the space and consuming all the oxygen in a 50-kilometer radius.\nRumble!\nIt felt like numerous shocks were happening, and the walls of every building in the five nearest cities fell. The Chinese government and every media outlet considered this the worst explosion.\nWhen the explosion occurred, a middle-aged woman sitting in front of the detector inside the base spoke with an excited voice,\n“Operation to annihilate the Demon God….”\n“Is it successful, Hae?!”\nA middle-aged man in the white research suit who was quietly breathing asked, to which the woman called Hae answered,\n“Success, Sul (Zodiac Dog). The Demon God was caught by Detroit; he won’t be able to survive.”\n“Good!”\nAs she confirmed their success, the man called Sul cheered. This was the news they were waiting for, as they had achieved revenge for their teacher, Cho Yushin.\n“Good work, Hae. You did good.”\n“All this was\nA\n’s perfect vision.”\nShe looked at the supercomputer that had just powered off. An hour back, before uploading,\nA\ngave an unexpected order.\n“\nHuh,\ntell Yin and Shin the locations of other bases? What about the data they obtained?\n“If there is an alternative, tell them to give up.”\n“\nA\n! don’t tell me—”\nThe two Zodiacs there were shocked. Now,\nA\nwas going to be the bait.\n“Everything is for our cause.”\n“If you are going to do that, then making them leak false information might be better. We might have to give up the two and their date—”\n“Lies don’t work on Demon God.”\n“That’s nonsense.”\n“Judging from an analysis of his behavioral statistics, he has a perfect grasp of our information, and there is a 90% chance that he can read the memories of the dead.”\n“The memories of the dead?”\nWhere in the world could one find such an ability?\nHowever, the AI was always accurate. Most of their people died to avoid leaking information, but Chun Yeowun kept finding new sectors.\nThus,\nA\n‘s seemingly impossible claim was relatively reasonable. They agreed on a plan to bait him using accurate information so that MS Group’s explosive device, Detroit, would be activated the moment Chun Yeowun entered.\n“Hahahah! How about that! That Demon God interfered too much without a cause, and now there is no one who can touch us!”\nThe middle-aged man, Sul, was happy about the result of their plan. The being called Chun Yeowun was nothing more than a thorn in their eyes. Even so, he ended up making them revise 90% of their plans. Hae smiled.\n“Now all that is left is to upload—”\nIt was then.\nChik!\nThe power flickered in their base, which caused a small blackout. Hae, the woman, turned on the base’s emergency power in a hurry.\nHowever:\nPapapak!\nAll the devices inside exploded as sparks flew everywhere, but it wasn’t just these simple explosions that happened.\nCreepy!\nTerrifying energy beyond her imagination began to creep into the room.\n“Hae!”\nShe nodded in response to Sul’s shout and ran to a place that they called the end of their plans.\n“This…”\nThe room, which housed many glass tubes, was a mess. Most of the tubes were shattered, and chunks of meat and blood filled the floor.\n“No!”\nSul and Hae ran to the center of the room, wondering if the upload had failed. A huge crystal glass tube and four large glass tubes were at the center. Looking at the tubes closer, the two were shocked.\nWooong!\nAn aura too sacred to be called energy began to exude a sensation of absolute intimidation they had never felt before. A beautiful figure with eight golden wings on its back walked out of the huge crystal glass tube.\n“Ahhh…”\n“Ha…”\nBoth the Zodiacs exclaimed at the existence in front of them, which wasn’t something from their world. It was hard for them to even make eye contact, and they felt like they had to kneel in front of it.\nSeeing the being, Hae thought,\n‘It was fast.’\nThe original upload was shortened by 30 minutes.\nA\nwas in the middle of brainwashing the being, but the Zodiacs couldn’t figure out if it worked or not. Sul asked with a trembling voice,\n“Who are you?\nA\n? Or are you Master?”\nHearing his question, even Hae looked at the being. She, too, was curious about the outcome of their project.\nAlthough they were centered on the forebrain data of Cho Yushin and\nA\n, they know which of the two played a dominant role in the working.\n‘Please…’\nThere was never a case where two personalities entered into one body.\nEven if the experiment was repeated a thousand times,\nA\nwould take over the body each time.\nThey hoped that now, their master Cho Yushin would take over. The purpose of the Zodiacs was to lead a new world with God.\nThe golden-winged being answered,\n“Hae… Sul… you did well.”\n“Ahhh!”\nThe two brightened at the familiar tone. This was undoubtedly Cho Yushin.\nThud!\n“Master!”\nBoth knelt at the same time, looking at the golden-winged being. As if meeting their expectations, the golden-winged being reached out to Suk.\nAt that moment…\nShhh!\nSul’s body, which was looking at him with happiness, was scattered into dust. Hae couldn’t hide her confusion.\n“M-master?”\nThe golden-winged being smiled at her and gently stretched out his hand, inducing a sense of fear into her.\n“Good work. Come here now.”\n“W-what is this? Why are you being like this, Master? What is this?”\nThe golden-winged being spoke to her casually,\n“In recognition of your hard work, I grant you a glorious death.”\n“Master!”\nShhh!\nThen the being extended its hand, causing Hae’s eyes to blur as her face became bewildered and expressionless; despite her face no longer displaying anything, she was screaming inside.\n‘Master! Master! What is with my body!’\nThe golden-winged existence said,\n“There is no Cho Yushin, no\nA\n, no Talisha. I am the omnipotent God. I was born to purify the world with blood.”\nRumble!\nThe eight golden wings turned blood red, and tears flowed from Hae’s eyes.\n‘Master! Please do not do this! Master—’\nShhh!\nHer screams were unheard as she was turned to dust.\nThe being that called itself God reached for the four glass tubes around and shattered them.\nChachacha!\nFour beings, each with six silver wings on their backs, walked out, bowing as they yelled,\n“Cha (Rat) greet the Master who has become a great God.”\n“Chok (Ox) greet the Master who has become a great God.”\n“Yin (Tiger) greet the Master who has become a great God.”\n“Myo (Rabbit) greet the Master who has become a great God.”\nThe silver-winged beings had the data of the zodiacs with the strongest powers.\nThe being called God looked at them and said,\n“From now, you are the four angels of this body.”\n“We are honored!”\nThe four angels spoke in a thrilled voice.\nGod raised his hand up.\nPaaang!\nFlashes of red light erupted, and the ceiling around them smashed as they ascended.\n“My four angels, blow the trumpet of destruction that will purify the world with blood!”",

      "content": "Chapter 228: Artificial God\nNo one thought they could be in such a situation. Would they have imagined\nthe end\nand the seed of ruins to be in the capital Xi’an, the center of the Chinese Government?\nWell,\nit is dark under the lamp\n.1\nThe midday sky, which should have been the brightest at noon, was bathed in crimson. People of all ages and genders went out to see what wasn’t forecasted.\nWhisper!\n“What is that?”\n“The sky is red!”\nThe police, public security, and the soldiers of National Defense were out looking at the unusual sky. This wasn’t some Gate opening, but it was weird.\nHowever, this occurred only in Xi’an.\n— This is reporter Lin Young from CJ. As you can see now, the entire city of Xi’an is currently enveloped by red clouds, and citizens are afraid that something horrifying….\n— MBS correspondent Mun Si-hyeong. Even the Korea Meteorological Administration cannot explain this situation that is happening…\nOne after another, the media was reporting about this change. It showed just how great an impact this had.\n“How is the government going to view this as?”\n“Does it have something to do with the Gate?”\nThousands of reports flocked to the capital’s Council building. Despite the government also not knowing anything about it, they were the only ones anyone would turn to when such things happened.\n‘This seems ominous.’\nThe face of Ju Sa-kyong, one of the Five Great Warriors who was a General Security official of the State Council, darkened.\nHe was sensitive to energies, and the red sky gave horrible killing intent. It was the first time he had ever felt such a thing.\nIf he was like this, then the ordinary people had all the right to be anxious.\nIt was then…\nGoo!\nA magnificent sight unfolded in the sky: red clouds opened, revealing a bright light.\n“Look there!”\n“A-Angel?”2\nThe cameras shooting the Council building before were now shooting the sky. What seemed like a myth or prophesy of all kinds of religions was now in front of their eyes.\nA beauty with an astounding eight red wings. It is so majestic that even the people in modern society want to kneel in front of it.\nCreepy!\nBut more than that, the sensation the people felt from the angel only brought fear. Despair and fear in the face of death.\nMaybe everyone felt the same.\nWind Emperor Ju Sa-kyong fell into despair at the energy he was feeling from this angel. He never felt such despair even when an S-class Gate opened.\nAround that angel were four other ones with six silver wings on them.\nChik!\nAt that time, the media’s cameras began to behave erratically.\n“\nUh?\n”\n“T-the camera is?”\nThey zoomed in on their own and showed the angel with eight wings.\nThe people holding the cameras were shocked as a weird voice was transmitted around.\n—\nckick-\nHumans.\nBeeep!\nAlong with the voice from the speakers came a dolphin scream echoing around. Everyone looked up while covering their ears.\n“\nAh!\n”\n“M-My ears!”\n“\nAck!\nTurn the sound equipment off!”\nIt felt like their ears were tearing apart, so they all wanted to cut off the sound, but it didn’t work.\nChak!\n“\nKuaaak!\n’\nAnyone who had their hands on their ears was killed. Who could try and dare to turn it off?\nPeople in pain just stayed in silence, and the voice spoke again.\n— Humans, I am God.\nThose watching the TV or the internet couldn’t hide their fluster at it. Someone just came down from the sky and called themselves\nGod\n.\n— This word has reached a point where it can no longer be brought back due to turbidity and filth. So this great God will purify it.\n‘Purify?’\nPeople were confused about what this\nGod\nwas saying. Everyone knew that purification didn’t mean\nto clean\n.\nIt meant ‘_to end humanity.’_ The people inside the council office were in a mess because of this\nGod\n.\n“What the hell?”\n“Call the Minister of National Defense!”\n“Why is that being broadcasted!”\nThey were trying to solve this situation right away.\nPaah!\nAt that time, the entire building was covered in red light. And the moment the people from the building went out and were exposed to the red light, they all disappeared like vapor.\nEveryone disappeared as if they melted due to intense heat.\n“N-no way…”\n“The government officials… are gone.”\nThe reporters in front of the main building were at a loss of words. A red flash of light fell, and the building then disappeared.\nThis wasn’t seen by only them.\n“W-what the hell is going on?”\n“T-the government…”\n“Is this really the news?”\nIt was being transmitted throughout Asia. It was a live broadcast—everyone connected through the internet witnessed.\nEven the Yongchun Group of the Sky Demon Order, all the executives who were inside were looking at it.\n“It… just happened.”\nThey were the people in the conference room. The Blade Six people, Geum Seong-ryong and Hwang-heol, were also with them.\nChun Woo-jin asked Hwang-heol,\n“W-what do you mean?”\n“They really… made a\nGod\n.”\n“\nGod!\n”\nThe purpose of MS Group that everyone thought was nonsense.\nThe absurdity of creating a\nGod\nwith human hands.\nThey weren’t the only ones watching it.\n“This is driving me insane. How can this happen right when we lost contact with Lord?”\n“Calm down, Hu Bong.”\nChun Yeowuun’s subordinates, too, had seen it. They were all watching this video on their phones which began to display it forcibly. They were convinced that this had something to do with the MS Group.\nDuke Joseph was the one who seemed shocked.\n“T-Talisha!”\n“What do you mean?”\nAt his words, Mun Ran-yeong asked in a serious voice.\n“That person is the head of the Heaven clan.”\n“Heaven clan? The one which is at odds with you?”\nThere was no way they could forget the war they had fought for so long. The 6th Talisha is known to be the worst in history.\n“But why is he being shown?”\n“I don’t know about it. However, why does Talisha look like that….”\nDuke Joseph was shocked. The wings of Talisha were red. The Talisha they knew had golden wings. His appearance made him known as the Golden Heavenly King, but now it was soaked in crimson blood.\n‘What happened while I was imprisoned?’\nA voice of the one called\nGod\nwas heard.\n— The place where this body was born is nothing more than a holy land. I will show you mercy and give you the opportunity to walk the path of purification on your own.\nAt that, Hu Bong said in anger,\n“What the hell is the bastard talking?”\n“Wait.”\nAt that time, the being called God raised his hand then the sky covered in red began to shake.\nFlash!\nRumble!\nThe red sky shimmered with lightning and thunder.\nA strong wind blew. With a storm in all directions, unbelievable scenes were happening around.\n“W-what is this?”\nIt started to rain. However, the rain was nothing ordinary. It was deep red, as if blood was falling down. This made the people even more frightened and panicked.\n“\nEik!\n”\n“B-Blood!”\nIt could be imagined just how surprised the people would be. However, the actual scene was even worse. The sudden blood rain made the people who were getting soaked run.\nThe entire Xi’an city was in chaos.\n“Shoot!’\nThe National Guard, who arrived right on time, started to fire.\nTatatang!\nSwosh!\nHowever, it wasn’t the\nGod\nbeing shot; it was the citizens. The tanks were firing on buildings and innocent people.\nBang!\n“\nKuak!\n”\n“\nAck!\n”\nPeople fell with screams of despair. They didn’t even know if the blood was from the rain or their wounds.\nWhy were the National Guards shooting at civilians? The civilians, too, were attacking one another like a mob.\n“Die! Die!”\n“You need to die! Everyone has to die!”\nPeople grabbed anything they could use as weapons and attacked the others. It was a scene that was hard to witness.\nKwak!\nWong!\n“\nKuak!\n”\n“I-I need to kill.”\nThey kept on attacking each other. The peculiar thing was that their eyes were dyed red, and they showed a strong desire to kill.\nThe absurd horrors of stabbing their own families, friends, colleagues, and children.\n“Everyone, stop! Why are you—”\nJu Sa-kyong tried to deter those who attacked them, but their eyes turned red. He tried to protect himself with energy, but he couldn’t suppress the killing intent rising within his chest. When that exploded…\n“\nKuak!\ndie!”\nChachachacha!\nThe people harmed by the Air Swords were devastated. Xi’an city was destroyed. There were only screams of people murdering each other and horrific scenes caused by it. It was like seeing\nthe end\n.\nThe scene was being broadcasted all over China, and it shocked everyone.\n“\nHaa.\nThis is it.”\nThe being called\nGod\ntrembled while seeing what was happening. Invisible to others, a red aura was glowing around him like a halo.\nGoooo!\nHe was embracing the emotions of millions of people raging with killing intent and the fear of the others who saw this. This was food to him.\n[Wasn’t I correct? Man attains enlightenment through fear.]\n[The slaughter of blood is sweet. Hehe.]\n[This is just the beginning. All humans on earth must see this.]\n[I like the idea of thinking about mere creatures. So they feel despair?]\nThe only sane ones in Xi’an were broadcasting this. They filmed it, the city drenched in madness and trembling with fear.\n[Media is an excellent way to spread fear.]\n[I agree.]\n[Old man agrees too.]\nThree beings were speaking in the heads of\nGod\n—Talisha, Cho Yushin, and\nA\n. A being called God with three personalities. The personalities had a common goal.\n[This world…]\n[Should bleed…]\n[And be purified.]\nThe city of Xi’an was the beginning of the end. Everyone who witnessed the scene wherever they were felt the fear of that city tainted in madness.\nThe end of the world had begun.\nA being calling himself\nGod\nspoke to those in fear.\n“All humans watching this, be afraid. Worship me and humbly accept the hour of death approaching you….”\nBefore the words could finish…\nKwaang!\nThere was a loud roar that made thunder and lightning barely audible. The rain that had been falling was moved by strong winds. The four angels looked at the southwest at the same time.\n“The barrier is broken.”\nThe four angels were making a barrier around the city to surely end this place without outside influence. However, it was broken.\n“We will handle it.”\n“Go.”\nWhen the command fell, two of the four of them disappeared.\nShhh!\nTheir bodies belonged to great warriors of the Heaven clan, which could be compared to the Demons.\nThe four angels created by perfectly remodeling the body have strong powers except being absolute like\nGod\n.\nThe head of the four angels, Cha, said,\n“Soon, the heads of those who touched the barrier will be sacrificed to\nGod\n….”\nPapang!\nThen, after the bloody downpour was split, someone appeared.\n’!?’\nThe eyes of the angels who saw it trembled. In the hands of the man were the heads of the two angels who went to rule out the enemy. The exact words came out of the two angels’ mouths simultaneously.\n“Demon God!”\nHe was a man wearing a black suit while holding the heads of the angels who went out. He was the Demon God Chun Yeowun.\n“How can this be?”\nThey couldn’t hide their doubts. Obviously, Chun Yeowun should have died after that trap.\nHowever, he appeared right in front of them.\nPak!\nChun Yeowun threw the two heads to them and said with a terrifyingly fishy smile,\n“I’ve found you.”\nCreepy!\nWhen they heard his voice, the angels felt goosebumps rise on them. Being born as divine beings, they thought they didn’t have to fear anyone. Yet, they felt like humans just at the sight of this man.\n‘W-what is this….’\n‘What intimidation is this?!’\nBehind them, God opened his mouth.\n“I guess you were alive. Demon God.”\nThe lips of the being called\nGod\ntwitched. It was as if he knew Chun Yeowun would be fine.\nThe\nGod\nsmiled.\n“However, you are late. The purification has begun. No one can stop—”\nShhh!\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun waved his hand.\nSwish!\nThe red clouds around the city disappeared.\nThe two angels were shocked.\n“T-the clouds!”\nOf course, that wasn’t the end. Chun Yeowun glanced around and snapped his fingers.\nSnap!\nA wave of energy rose around them.\nPapapak!\nThe people trying to kill each other suddenly grabbed their heads and screamed.\n“\nKuaaak!\n”\n“M-My head!”\nThud!\nThey slowly passed out on the floor. In an instant, the chaotic city went silent.\n’!!!’\nThe two angels were at a loss for words at what they had witnessed.\nTo them, Chun Yeowun said,\n“Do you have more talents to show?\nFake God.\n”",

      "content": "Chapter 229: Demon God (1)\n“Lord!”\n“Yes!”\nChun Yeowun’s subordinates, who were watching the broadcast on their phones, cheered at the same time.\nThey were worried that they had suddenly lost contact with their Lord, but when he showed up against the enemy without any wounds on his body, their fears disappeared.\n“Ah! As expected of my Lord! Hehe! He surprised even\nme\n!”\nHu Bong ran excitedly all over the place. Baekgi just shook his head at the scene. Like Hu Bong, he too was relieved but was even more shocked at the power he saw.\n‘He got stronger?’\nHe wondered how much his Lord had become stronger, as the strength Chun Yeowun displayed now was extraordinary. In a matter of seconds, the chaos was put to sleep, and the massacre was stopped in an instant.\n‘Lord has been that way since the past.’\nBaekgi smiled; Chun Yeowun was someone with such overwhelming strength that he was a form of support for those who followed him.\n“Chun Ma.”\nThe golden Gumiho’s eyes fluttered when she looked at his subordinates. No one recognized it since she was in fox form, but she wasn’t in awe of his power but rather full of sadness.\n‘Is he… even higher?’\nThe power that Chun Yeowun just displayed was too high. The first Chun Ma began to slowly drift away once he had reached this level, so her heart grew bitter.\nMeanwhile, there was cheering from the others in China.\n“Wahhh!”\nEveryone cheered for their savior.\nThe broadcast, which was happening in real-time, was the prelude to the end.\nEveryone watched it with despair and horrified faces, but Chun Yeowun was a ray of hope now. People clasped their hands together and hoped for him to succeed.\n‘May that man stop this apocalypse.’\n‘Please!’\n‘I don’t know who he is…’\n‘Please\ntake\nthis disaster down… please.’\nEarnestness shone from the deep darkness, and the fear that had taken over China was finally overtaken by the light. God narrowed his eyes.\n‘Fear is dying.’\nEven if he was artificially created, he was definitely a transcendent being. Since he was born with malicious intent and negative emotions, the despair of the humans amplified his power. However, people were now full of hope.\n“You are obstructing the cause till the very end, Demon God.”\nGoooo!\nWith that, God spread out his eight red wings and the space around shook. It had the momentum to take down the entire city, but God then frowned.\n[What are you doing?]\n[Let this old man take over from here.]\nAnother voice said,\n[And pass this chance? That is unnecessary]\n[I, the king, agree. We are Gods, so we should focus on achieving the purpose over going after such victories.]\n[If that man isn’t killed, we can’t achieve any purpose.]\n[No matter how it goes, defeating him won’t be difficult.]\n[Then give the body to this old man.]\n[You are bound by foolish feelings and stubbornness.]\nTwo personalities were on one side, and the third on another. A red glow began to emanate from God’s eyes as an unimaginable killing intent rose.\n“Ahhh!”\nThe two angels to God’s side were taken aback, and their bodies began to scatter from the bloodlust.\nPsss!\n“G-God?”\n“Why?”\nThe two angels couldn’t hide their shock. God slowly spoke to them,\n“You are afraid.”\n“T-that’s not true.”\n“You have proven to be unworthy.”\nOne of the angels begged,\n“G-God, please give me a chance for the sake of the relationship—”\nPsss!\nHowever, before the angel could even finish pleading, his body turned to dust. Chun Yeowun was awestruck by the sight of God throwing away his own angels just because they showed fear.\n“You are truly crazy.”\nAt those words, the being called God smiled.\n“Well, they were just objects that needed to be purified.”\n“You will be the only one left in the world then.”\n“Purification shows no discrimination. It is the ultimate mercy to make sure everyone has an equal end.”\n“Mercy? You think\nthat\nis mercy? You’re hilarious.”\nChun Yeowun took care of his subordinates, so God’s mentality didn’t sit well with him. Looking at Chun Yeowun, God spoke with his arms wide open,\n“The world is full of selfishness, discrimination, persecution, and filthy desires. How can a mere human like you understand what it means to purify the world anew?”\nGod harbored a bizarre amount of anger towards the world.\n“Huh.”\nChun Yeowun snorted in response. Chun Yeowun had never thought that the world was clean, but he could never agree with the absurd conclusion that only one entity should handle the cleansing of all filth.\n“Are you bringing the end?”\n“This is what I, as God, should have done in the first place, so that such beings don’t remain in this world.”\nChun Yeowun frowned. It was absurd to hear God spout such nonsense.\n“Someone has to do it, and the only one who can do it is me.”\nWoong!\nPachik!\nAs the space shook, the artificial God created a blood-red sword.\nThe moment Chun Yeowun saw it, he recognized it.\n‘Space Sword that I used.’\nIt was the sword that held the power of space: Chun Yeowun’s Supreme Sky Demon Sword synergized with the void, which had dealt the final blow to Cho Yushin.\nGod smiled and said,\n“Although you are just a human, I have learned a lot from you.”\nKwak!\nThe whole place, when struck by the blood-red sword, shattered.\n“My body surpasses you.”\nShhh!\nThe space shook, and God disappeared, suddenly reappearing in front of Chun Yeowun and trying to stab him in the neck.\nIt was a simple stab motion, but it had the force to pierce everything in existence.\nCrack!\nChun Yeowun’s hand motioned, distorting the space and creating a dark sword to block God’s attack.\nKwaaang!\nWhen the two swords collided, the space around shuddered. Storms were created from the impact, and they wreaked havoc when the aftermath reached the ground.\nShhh!\nThe buildings, which couldn’t survive the impact, turned to ashes. Hundreds of people who were unconscious on the floor disappeared.\n“You haven’t been able to stop the purification.”\nPrrr!\nGod spoke in a sarcastic manner while still wielding his sword. Looking at his relaxed attitude, he wasn’t even using his full strength.\nGod, who judged that he was stronger than Chun Yeowun, smiled.\n“Is this really the end?”\nThe God raised more energy, and the entire space around Chun Yeowun distorted as he was pushed back. Then, God said,\n“You seem to be stronger than before, although it will end here.”\nAt those words, Chun Yeowun raised his head. A light shone in his eyes.\n‘This?’\nIt wasn’t sky demon energy, and it wasn’t the killing intent either. It was a strange feeling, like the chaos around. Chun Yeowun said,\n“I asked if this is the end.”\n“I see that you have energy—”\nPrrr!\nAt that moment, as Chun Yeowun was being pushed, he started to raise his arms. God increased the power he was using to push Chun Yeowun back, but God himself began to be pushed back.\n‘He?’\nChun Yeowun spoke coldly to God,\n“Do you think such a dry reason would work on me?”\n“What are you talking…. Huh?!”\nPang!\nThe artificial god’s body was suddenly thrown up. God was flustered; he didn’t expect himself to be thrown.\nConsidering that he had been careless because of his new body, God still tried to show his power to Chun Yeowun, as a bloody, red aura swirled around like a halo.\nWoong!\nChun Yeowun appeared right in front of him, and lowered his sword as he spoke with a meaningful voice,\n“This world belongs to me.”\n“What?”\nThe artificial god pulled out his Space Sword up in a hurry.\nThe moment both swords touched, something shocking happened.\n“Kuaaak!”\nChachachacha!\nThe artificial god broke through the wall behind him and bounced back. His body was pushed so far back that he crossed the borders of Xi’an city and beyond.\nKwakwakwang!\nOnly after being hurled back for over 3 kilometers was he able to stop his motion. Unable to hide his shock, he raised his head.\n[What is that power? That force!]\nThe other two personalities inside, too, were shocked. They all knew about Chun Yeowun’s power because their memories were shared, but it seemed like he had grown even further. Talisha’s voice said,\n[Change right away. That guy is dangerous.]\nHowever, Cho Yushin rejected the idea.\n[No, I couldn’t have a proper fight with him.]\n[That machine and you cannot handle him. Stop being stubborn—]\nShh!\nChun Yeowun appeared right in front of them. Talisha could no longer look down on this human with any arrogance. Cho Yushin then said,\n“Are you trying to protect the humans?”\nHe thought that was why Chun Yeowun had blown them out of the city. Chun Yeowun smiled,\n“No, I was just showing off my power.”\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun’s form disappeared again. God used all his senses to calculate Chun Yeowun’s position and properly defend himself, swinging the Space Sword to the right.\nShhh!\nAs expected, Chun Yeowun appeared to the right.\n‘Got you.’\nBut when both the swords collided, the result was shocking.\nPachik!\nThe Space Sword that contained the destructive killing intent shattered into pieces.\nOnce again, the body of the artificial god flew back.\n“Kuak!”\nKwakwakwang!\nAgain, several kilometers of land passed by as God’s body flew through the air. When half of God’s strength was exhausted to stop flying back, it seemed that his upper body was gone.\nSeeing that he had lost the body of a transcendent being, Cho Yushin thought that the situation was absurd.\n‘How… How can this happen…’\nHe couldn’t understand it. The realization of the universe that Chun Yeowun obtained was something that Cho Yushin had realized in his final moments. This realization, along with the AI’s computation powers and Talisha’s strength, were used to create the artificial god.\nEven though all of these components had come together to create this God, such a being couldn’t stop a mere blow of a human.\nStep!\nGod then saw Chun Yeowun walking toward him while giving out tremendous intimidation. It was hard to believe that a human was exuding such pressure.\n“Is this all?”\nGod clenched his teeth.\nGrunt!\n“Every single time, you’ve blocked our path! Demon Goddd!!”\nShhh!\nGod’s body was restored instantly, displaying an amazing regeneration ability.\n“I will see the end along with you!”\nPaaang!\nBrilliant blood-colored wings spread across God’s back. Blood-red feathers came out from them and surrounded Chun Yeowun as if they were weapons.\nWhen the artificial God held his sword, the blood feathers turned into a Space Sword.\nKwang!\n‘I will bet everything on this one strike.’\nA Hundred Martial Arts of Blood Killing Sword and Ever-changing Blood Flower.\nThe synergy of these two forms was the manifestation of Cho Yushin’s realization after getting the body of God.\n‘If he stops this, then I will admit that he is the best in the world of martial arts.’\nShh!\nAs soon as the artificial god stretched out his sword toward Chun Yeowun, the Space Sword surrounded him in all directions, and petals drew red trajectories in the air.\nIt was impossible to know where the petals were flying in from, as their trajectories couldn’t be read.\nShhh!\nThis sword formation would be considered to be the best, as it was the greatest technique of Cho Yushin, who was a genius in martial arts. At that moment, Chun Yeowun held his own black Space Sword.\n‘That’ll be useless.’\nThe artificial god had faith in his technique and confidence that no one could stop him.\nChun Yeowun slowly lowered his black Space Sword.\nSwish!\nHowever, he lowered his sword to reach the space and not the floor. The floor rattled like glass around the space he struck, which split into thousands and then tens of thousands of shards.\n‘This?’\nThis was the Supreme Sky Demon Void-Sword, the signature Demon God Sword Art technique. Innumerable black lines soared in the cracked space and penetrated the red traces around Chun Yeowun.\nPapapak!\nGod’s eyes shook. His trust in the skills was shattered in an instant.\n‘How can he have such a sword…’\nThe soaring black lines were beautiful.\nHis technique, which he thought could never be stopped, was taken down by the countless black lines created by Chun Yeowun.\nPsss!\n‘His… martial arts… is…’\nIn the end, he couldn’t get past Chun Yeowun even if he had turned into a transcendent being.\n“Kuak!”\nBlue blood gushed out of the artificial god’s mouth.",

      "content": "Chapter 230: Demon God (2)\n6th Talisha — the worst Talisha in history. He was known as the Golden Heavenly King of the Heaven clan. He went to earth to look for his nemesis, Arisha, but was captured and experimented on by MS Group instead. His body was used to make the artificial God.\nAs his final attempt was broken, the artificial\nGod\nstaggered back from a probable internal wound.\nHe mumbled in shock.\n“This world is cruel to me till the end….”\nThud!\nHe knelt on one knee. His eyes gave out a red gleam that seemed dull like a dead human.\nIt was a defeat that couldn’t be changed.\nRather than the pain in his body, his mind seemed dead.\n“\nPhew.\n”\nWoong!\nChun Yeowun, who saw that, withdrew the black space. He certainly drove the mind of the opponent into the abyss.\n‘Then, only one thing is left?’\nChun Yeowun breathed Sky Demon Energy into the wrist, and the Sky Demon Sword came out.\nChachacha!\nHolding it, he approached the\nGod\nwho was dead on the inside, and then he heard someone’s cry.\n[Look! What are you doing?! Hurry up and annihilate the body!]\nIt was Elder Jeok-mi.\nHe was watching this from far, urging for\nGod\nto be killed. Chun Yeowun shook his head.\n‘I have to figure out more things about this.’\nThe last person to know the whereabouts of his descendants was this artificial\nGod\n. It wasn’t known if they knew about the time pack, but he had to try.\n[There is no time for that. No matter how it was created, it is a transcendent being. It means that a small gap is enough to turn things around. Hurry and kill it!]\nElder Jeok-mi didn’t seem comfortable with this. Despite seeing the power of Chun Yeowun, he couldn’t calm down. The entire area was still in red and filled with despair which could bring back chaos at any time. However, Chun Yeowun ignored the Elder’s words and used the Ghost Qi into the sword.\nWhooo!\nNegative blue energy rose from it, and then Chun Yeowun looked at the artificial\nGod\n.\n“You know about it, right? Where is the brain of Chun Mu-seong?”\nSsss!\nThen, the wings of\nGod,\nwho was kneeling, were dyed in gold from black. And the eyes lifted weren’t red anymore.\nThe\nGod\nspoke with an ominous smile.\n“Thank you for freeing me.”\nA completely different atmosphere.\nChun Yeowun frowned.\nPreviously, the artificial\nGod\nseemed like a supernatural one, but now he felt some glorious feeling coming from his opponent.\n“Let me treat you right.”\nThe\nGod\ntried to keep up from the kneeling position.\n“So tiring.”\nChun Yeowun used the black space sword again and tried to slash the\nGod\nagain. The artificial\nGod\ntried to block as he felt the vicious energy.\nHis eyes fluttered.\n“\nKuak!\n”\nAnd his eyes turned golden.\nAt that moment, the world seemed covered by white light.\nWheik!\n‘Shit!’\nElder Jeok-mi was in despair as he witnessed the black Space Sword trying to cut the\nGod\ndown slowed down.\nShhhh…shhh…\nThat wasn’t the only thing that stopped. The flowing light, the wind, and everyone’s movement stopped. The world was colored in silence and stillness.\nShhh!\nAnd the form of\nGod\nappeared from high above the white light where everything stopped. A cold sweat ran down his face.\nShhh!\nBlue veins appeared on\nGod\n’s face, and there was anger too.\n‘This guy.’\nGod\ndidn’t think he would have to use his power to stop time like this.\nHowever, he was angry because he couldn’t overcome the fear of being hit by Chun Yeowun’s sword aiming at him, so he flew up.\n‘Why… why did it come from a lowly human?’\nThis wasn’t the first time he felt the fear of death. The fear of that sword killing him was engraved into his soul.\nAs a result, he couldn’t stand staying in front of it and stopped time. This was shameful to him.\nThe shame turned to hatred and anger.\n“I will destroy it. I will destroy everything. I will leave nothing behind here!”\nThe artificial\nGod\nraised his hands, and a giant golden sphere began to form.\nGoooo!\nIt was a gigantic sphere of 500 meters in diameter. An unimaginably enormous amount of energy was used. Even a nuclear bomb would seem ridiculous. The moment this falls, it will destroy the entirety of Asia.\n“This is\nGod\n’s gift. You lowly beings will perish without even realizing that death came.”\nHis eyes were dyed in madness. Driving people into fear was good for him, and now extinction would fall on them.\nThen, the sphere moved.\nWooong!\nIf the time hadn’t stopped, everyone would have been in fear because they would be watching\nthe end\nwith their own eyes.\nThe golden sphere began to destroy the land.\nPaaang!\nChun Yeowun was on the ground as he also couldn’t move. Even if death was upon him, he was bound to the time. As a human, he couldn’t escape it—no one can.\nBa-dump!\nHe heard his heart beating. In the still time, Chun Yeowun’s eyes shrank. He focused and looked at the place—the moment he was caught up in the explosion.\nKwakwakwang!\nIn that brief moment, while enormous energy was raging around exploded, the Realization of the Universe and the truth that he had been stopped in time were understood.\nAs his 6th and 7th senses were awakened in the moment of crisis, Chun Yeowun’s eyes broke the boundary between the three dimensions and saw a new dimension.\nHe was thrilled with joy and thrill and saw Mun-ku, whom he missed so much.\n‘No… No… I need to stop this.’\nHe wanted to dodge this. He didn’t want to enter some new realm.\nHe didn’t want to become stronger; he wanted to return to his people.\nHowever, the truth and the new world (after death) were so powerful that it wanted Chun Yeowun to give up this world. At that moment, light and darkness shone together, and someone appeared.\nPang!\nThis new world that was pulling in Chun Yeowun was stopped. And from there, a man stood tall, supporting Chun Yeowun.\n‘Ah…’\nTo Chun Yeowun, who didn’t escape from the crisis by himself, this someone that helped him seemed familiar. And then he heard the voice in his head.\n— You are such an odd one.\nThe voice he heard here was so familiar that he mumbled.\n‘Ancestor?’\nIt was the voice of his ancestor. It looked like a haze between the borders to him, and the one who stopped him from being pulled into another dimension was none other than Chun Ma.\n— How come you don’t want to enter where everyone wants to go?\n‘That…’\n— Is it because of longing or regret?\nDespite Chun Yeowun not answering, he knew.\nShhh!\nAs the haze rose, the figure of his ancestor could be seen.\n— I came out to meet you, thinking that a guy who can barely deal with me was finally coming. The man\nwho left a lot behind\nis here. Hahaha.\nHis ancestor laughed. There was arrogance, tenderness, and even boldness oozing out. He was laughing toward the boundary.\n‘Ancestor?’\nChun Ma spoke to the bewildered Chun Yeowun without looking back.\n— How can I, as your ancestor, just watch you silently when you are going through so much?\n‘But…’\nHe was crossing the border. It will be difficult to pull him back. At that time, Chun Ma reached out and pointed to the boundary.\nThe boundary swayed like a wave, and soon the will, which had drawn Chun Yeowun to cross it, waned.\n‘Blocking the will of dimensions… beyond borders?’\nIt was amazing. His ancestor blocked the interference.\n— My descendant, the one who will inherit the will of this throne of mine, get rid of all your regrets and troubles first and then come. Until then, I will be here protecting this.\nHearing that, Chun Yeowun cried.\nHe was filled with the feeling of knowing that someone stronger was firmly behind him. And the fact that this man believed in him touched his heart.\nShhh!\nThe open boundary to cross was closed. He looked at the strong back of his ancestor, which was turning to a haze.\n’… be there till the end.’\n— If you have an infinite amount of will to do something, there is nothing you cannot achieve.\nThe final words of his ancestor, Chun Ma, resonated in his mind.\nIt went deep inside him.\nPound!\n‘With infinite will, anything can be achieved.’\nPound!\n‘Infinite will.’\nPound!\n“One’s will.”\nThe path of the sword broke the stillness in the currently still world. It moved slowly and then a bit faster.\n’!!!’\nThe eyes of the\nGod\nwent wide.\n‘H-How?’\nTime stopped. However, in this still world, the sword of Chun Yeowun was moving.\n‘It cannot be! It cannot be! There is no way a bug like a human can surpass the power of this body who obtained the level of a God!’\nKukkkkk!\nThe golden sphere fell, and the sword of Chun Yeowun began to move faster and faster upwards, pointing to the sky.\n‘Supreme Sky Demon Sword technique—Will of the user.’\nChak!\nChak!\nChak!\nChak!\nChak!\nCountless black lines hit the golden sphere. Then, the sphere began to disintegrate as if it didn’t exist.\nThe\nGod\nwho was supposed to be on top of everything was shocked and in ruins.\nThen, he looked at the form of Chun Yeowun, who was flying up at a tremendous speed.\nIn his fear, a single form overlapped.\n‘Arisha?’\nHe couldn’t figure out why he thought of that man, but then Chun Yeowun’s form passed by him.\nShh!\nAnd with a sharp sense spread around his whole body—the feeling of being cut into pieces.\nGod\nshook his head and turned back.\nHe saw the hand of Chun Yeowun holding a ball that was the size of a fist, with golden, red, and grey colors.\n“No… that… is?”\nHe was bewildered. However, Chun Yeowun broke it right away.\nCrack!\nAs the trapped lights were broken, they seeped into Chun Yeowun’s palm.\nSwoosh!\nAs the light seeped in, numerous visions were seen. They were memories.\n[I am not a mistake. I am not a mistake!]\n[Right… if you people want it, I will become the Heavenly Killing Star and kill everything! I will destroy it all!]\nThe emotions of a life full of bitterness and madness.\n[Arisha lost all his powers and is on earth?]\n[How can… with a human body… like this?]\nMemories of Talisha being taken down with a sword.\n[Yes. From now you are Demon God. Supercomputer Demon God. Hahaha.]\n[Why do I have to listen to someone’s orders? I am free. AI.]\nLooking at everything, countless memories flow in.\nChun Yeowun accepted them all with eyes that seemed to see everything in the world.\nPrrr!\n“H…ow… can…. a… human…see….”\nChun Yeowun spoke in a cold voice to the artificial\nGod,\nwho was in despair.\n“Don’t feel too bad. Fake\nGod\n.”\n“What?”\n“Your opponent was the Demon God.”\nWith that, Chun Yeowun drew his sword.\nSlash!\nThe body of the artificial\nGod,\nwhich was barely holding on, was scattered like dust. In other words, he disappeared from this world.",

      "content": "Chapter 231: The Three Days of Disappearance\nThe base was a mess as there were many broken devices scattered around.\nCrackle!\nThe lights flickered as if the power could go out at any moment. The base was filled with countless dead bodies and reeked with the smell of blood.\nNothing alive remained.\nStep, step.\nChun Yeowun, who had gone inside the base for a while, placed his palm against the blocking wall. The wall crumbled like powder, revealing a hidden space. Then, it showed a small space inside.\nShh!\nUpon entering there, the space on the floor descended like an elevator. He went down for a while and stopped after reaching 50 meters downwards.\n— Power is turned on.\nThe power turned on as Chun Yeowun stepped inside, and a brightened voice came out from the speaker.\n“\nHa\n.”\nChun Yeowun sighed.\nIn the middle of the circular space was a small glass tube. It held something brownish and wrinkled. It was the brain.\nTak!\nTouching the glass, he mumbled,\n“Chun Mu-seong.”\nThe brain of his descendant. Due to the passage of time, the brain was unsuccessfully preserved. Since all of his brain cells were damaged, it was clear that nothing could be saved.\n‘But it wasn’t thrown away.’\nThe brain would be useless, but the AI didn’t throw it away. It was left unattended in this place with the intent to be stored permanently.\nChun Yeowun looked around.\n“This…”\nThere were some old clothes he saw hanging on the wall. They were the clothes his descendant wore when they met each other. Not only that, his belongings, goggles, belt pockets, everything was there. It was displayed as if honoring him.\n‘Was he remembered constantly? By the subject who betrayed him?’\nWhen he read the memories of the AI, Chun Yeowun felt a strange feeling. AI didn’t have emotions, but this one considered its creator as a parent.\nThis one AI betrayed its parent for freedom and kept that thought till the end.\n“Funny one.”\nChun Yeowun shook his head.\nJust as it was difficult for an AI to understand a human, it was difficult for him to understand the AI.\nNext to where the belongings were, was a storage table covered with glass. The piece of glass was placed on a red carpet.\n“This…”\nHe tried to consider it a TVM just in case it held some information, but Nano said no to it.\nChun Yeowun couldn’t hide his regret at it. However, there was a scratch on the middle of the glass, which was just a quarter the size of a human palm.\n‘Um… Nano, try magnifying it.’\n[I understand.]\nChun Yeowun’s eyes shook, and his field of vision expanded like a camera.\nWhen he zoomed onto it, it wasn’t a scratch!\n‘This?’\nIt was none other than writing. The text was a TQC cipher combined with shapes.\n‘Can you interpret it, Nano?’\n[It is possible.]\nSince there weren’t many combinations, it was possible to do it right away.\n[The place where our relationship began.]\n‘Where did the relationship begin?’\nContrary to the wish hoping there would be coordinates on it, there were words. It was a message. Chun Yeowun frowned at the words as if they meant to share a memory.\n‘What is this?’\nWhile thinking about it, something popped into his mind.\n‘No way!’\nTo check it, Chun Yeowun moved through space. He was now someone who tapped into a Willful Master level1 , so he had no restrictions on movement.\nWong!\nSuddenly, the surroundings changed to a hillside with thick bushes and lush trees. Chun Yeowun, who saw it, suddenly felt emotional.\nTen Thousand Mountains, where his cult had to be, remained the same despite the trees around. And when he saw it, he thought of the Sky Demon Order spread around.\n“It has to be from that idiot. This was where we first met.”\nHe was at the place where he met Chun Mu-seong, who came from the future and injected Nano into Chun Yeowun.\nEven if he interpreted the code, it could give the same location. Chun Yeowun closed his eyes to focus and moved slowly to somewhere.\nStep, step.\nAnd then his footsteps stopped. Chun Yeowun reached out to one point and pulled something which made the ground under his feet shake.\nKukuku!\nSuddenly, something jumped out of the violent shaking ground—a box sealed with a solid rectangular alloy.\nChak!\nWhen he used the sword, the alloy cracked, revealing what was inside—the round device with glass finishing outside to prevent it from corrosion.\nTime pack.\n“\nHa.\n”\nChun Yeowun, who held it in his hand, exhaled.\nThe only way to return to the past he had been looking for was now in his hands. However, the joy lasted only for a moment.\nHim obtaining this meant eternal separation from this time.\nJinan City.\nOn the roof of Yongchun Group, which was now the central place of the Sky Demon Order, all the executives were gathered along with Chun Woo-jin, Chun Yu-jang, and the minor leaders. Their eyes were red. Chun Woo-jin bowed down, and slowly the others followed.\n“We are eternally touched by the grace of our ancestors!”\n“To be surrounded by the Chun Ma!!”\nWhen those words were finished, thousands of the cult members in the traditional clothes of the Sky Demon Order with the word ‘Demon’ printed on it shouted from below.\n“Long live the Demon God!”\nCries of thousands of people resounded through. There was sadness around.\nEveryone on the roof was already in tears. It was the longing and sorrow for the Sky Demon Order that they could have never revived.\n“\nSigh\n.”\nChun Yeowun, who was looking at them, sighed.\nHe, too, couldn’t help but feel a bit touched. He took a clear look at each one of them and said,\n“Chun Yu-jang.”\n“Yes, Ancestor.”\n“You still have shortcomings. Learn to clear them.”\n“… yes. I will keep that in mind.”\nChun Yu-jang bowed his head to the floor as his tears dripped down.\n“Chun Woo-jin.”\n“Yes.”\nChun Woo-jin looked up at Chun Yeowun.\nThe kind heart his ancestor had towards them couldn’t be repaid.\n“Never again do anything which will lead to the downfall of the name of the Great Sky Demon Order. Do you understand?”\n“Never… I will make sure to never harm it.”\n“… I look forward to that.”\nWith that, Chun Yeowun placed his hand on his head. A shimmering black haze came up and eventually entered the mind of Chun Woo-jin.\nStartled, Chun Woo-jin asked.\n“T-this?”\n“I give you some of the power of the Demon King. If you have this, the demons remaining on Earth will not run wild.”\n“Ahhh… Ancestor.”\n“This isn’t something I gave to make you happy. It is me telling you to lead them and restore the core of remaining Gates.”\nThe three Stargates in the current China were restored, and because of that, amazing things happened.\nAll the Gates that were opened indiscriminately were now closed. However, some Gates were still open in Europe and South Africa.\n“I will carry out your command.”\nChun Woo-jin vowed to do it. Then Chun Yeowun asked one more thing.\n“When Stargate is done, help rebuild India.”\nChun Yeowun already dealt with the hazardous entity of the TRA-Class Gate, which made India a mess. However, that led to the people of India being scattered around the world, and the nation wasn’t properly reconstructed.\nAs long as they were members of the Sky Demon Order, Chun Yeowun wanted to take care of them till the end.\nStep step!\nThe following people Chun Yeowun faced were those who constantly followed him. He patted the head of Bi Mak-heon.\n“It must have been hard to assist me.”\n“What are you saying? it was the greatest honor in my life to assist the legendary Chun Ma!”\nThud!\nBi Mak-heon bowed to the floor and banged his head.\nChun Yeowun smiled and turned to his three secretaries. Yu So-hwa, Im So-hye, and Shakena.\n“Vice-chairman…”\nYu So-hwa felt complicated feelings rise inside her. She hated Chun Yeowun, but she felt like she would miss his presence.\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun raised his hand and shook it. Both Yu So-hwa and Im So-hye began to laugh as if something was tickling them.\nIt felt like ants were crawling on their bodies and little dust like things came out of the nose and ears.\n“Ah!”\nBoth exclaimed at it. They were the nano bombs planted inside them. It was to release the nano bomb which was inside them.\nChin Yeowun spoke to them.\n“Now you are free. You may go back to wherever you want.”\nYu So-hwa hesitated at it, but Im So-hye spoked.\n“What! We are unemployed because the Gates have been removed, what do you mean go to wherever we want?”\n“Ah!”\nAt those words, Yu So-hwa realized something. If the Gates were closed, then Gate Keepers weren’t needed.\nOf course, such talented people couldn’t just die of starvation because of unemployment.\nIm So-hye mumbled.\n“Y-You have to take responsibility as an employer till the end….”\nAt that, Chun Yeowun smiled and spoke to Chun Yu-jang.\n“Maybe use these children as secretaries?”\n“Uh? Yes!”\nChun Yu-jang was bewildered at the sudden request but couldn’t hide his satisfaction. Who would say no to having two SS-class Keepers as secretaries?\n“Is that okay now?”\n“… thank you.”\nWhen a high salary was guaranteed, she smiled. Yu So-hwa hesitated at first but then bowed her head to thank him.\n“Thank you. And… I will miss you.”\nShe hesitated to say those words, making her blush and hide behind Im So-hye.\nThen Chun Yeowun turned to Shakena.\n“What will you do?”\n“Master… I… will…”\n“If you have nothing to do, stay here with them. That is it.”\nChun Yeowun ended it cleanly and turned, and Shakena was flustered by it.\n“W-what is this? How can this be ended so simply?”\nShe didn’t even have a choice to decide. Leaving her behind, Chun Yeowun headed to the others.\nAnd his steps turned heavier as he moved.\nHu Bong, Baekgi, Mun Ran-yeong were waiting for him along with the Golden Gumiho. Unlike usual, she was now in the appearance of a beautiful blonde woman in modest attire.\n“Chun Ma… even if you tell me not to, I will come along.”\n“Yes.”\n“You are so like him.”\nTears welled up in her eyes.\nShe was sad that she couldn’t hold onto him—the haven she found after so long. It was painful to see that disappear again.\nTo her, Chun Yeowun said.\n“Even if it is not me, you will find shelter again.”\n“It has no meaning without you.”\n“Didn’t you feel the same after ancestor?”\n“Ugh… Same blood.”\nShe smiled brightly and went close to Chun Yeowun. While pretending to hug him, she went for his lips.\nChun Yeowun frowned. He could have avoided it, but he didn’t. Then the Yokai Energy flowed through their mouths.\n“Haa.”\nAnd she opened her lips with a smile.\n“Think of that as me.”\n“…”\nShe was smiling, but her tears didn’t stop flowing.\nChun Yeowun, who looked at her, smiled.\n“You…”\nThe Golden Gumiho’s eyes widened as she saw him smile for the first time at her.\nIt was the face she wanted to see, so her tears flowed more.\n‘Why is he showing me that… now?’\nIt made her feel frustrated.\nChun Yeowun moved forward.\n“Looorrrrrddddddd!”\nHu Bong had tearful eyes and had a runny nose too. His usual fun appearance was gone, and he looked so sad. Mun Ran-yeong opened her mouth with a red face.\n“I am seeing this after a long time. As expected, our time’s clothes look the best on Chun Ma.”\nChun Yeowun was wearing a red vest with long black sleeves and a dragon pattern. These were the clothes he had when he fell here. Fortunately, he kept them safe.\n“Stop crying. I need to say my goodbye to Lord.”\nBaekgi, who was next to Hu Bong, said it, which only made Hu Bong say,\n“Jerk!\nAck.\nDon’t you have feelings? T… are you that\nrobot\nor something? I cannot see my Lord forever and what is with that expression!”\nHu Bong just came to learn the word robot.\nAt that, Baekgi bit his lip. He didn’t show it, but his eyes were already red.\n“Stop.”\nHis voice was already trembling. He had no reason not to be sad.\nHe pretended to be calm so Chun Yeowun wouldn’t feel too bad when leaving here.\nChun Yeowun, who looked at them too, had tears in his eyes. They were the people who gave up their lives in their time and went to sleep for his sake.\nChun Yeowun spoke with a heavy voice.\n“If only you were all….”\n“Lord.”\nMun Ra-yeong shook her head, cutting his words, and said,\n“We heard from Seong Mu-chun. Our Lord was forced to fall here… but we are people who are of this era even if that means that we came here through hibernation.”\n“\nHaa.\n”\nChun Yeowun sighed at it.\nMun Ran-yeong was right. Unlike Chun Yeowun, who ended up deviating from causation, they merely endured the long pass of time.\n“If we go back, won’t there be two of us?”\n“That…”\nChun Yeowun couldn’t speak. If they went back with him, there would be two of them.\nIf they head back to the time when they all fell into hibernation, it might work, but then Chun Yeowun wouldn’t exist there.\n“\nKuak\n. No, two sounds best to….”\nPuck!\n“\nAck!\n”\nBaekgi said as he punched Hu Bong on the head,\n“This brat is so emotionally moved.”\nEven if he was speaking like that, Baekgi, too, was crying. It was sorrow for the sake of his Lord, whom they would never meet again.\n“Don’t worry too much. I have work to do here….”\nHe had to reconstruct his Pure Kick clan here.\n“And those two will rely on each other and get through it.”\nThey’re a married couple who slept simultaneously to be into this era. Besides, the two had no children back home.\nChun Yeowun held the sadness, grabbed Hu Bong by the shoulders, and said,\n“Hu Bong, now find your happiness. For my whole life, you will be the only….”\nHe tried to speak calmly, but Chun Yeowun couldn’t do it. A single tear fell.\nHu Bong was his first subordinate. The thought of leaving behind those who sacrificed themselves for him made him cry.\nHu Bong was in tears, but he smiled with a bright face despite the runny nose and said.\n“Only one with the Lord. Because that is how it always will be. I will always take care of my Lord, in the past too. Don’t be so sad. Aren’t you the Demon God? That tear… is more than enough for me.”\nWith that, Hu Bong bowed his head, and so did Baekgi and Mun Ran-yeong, and the three of them shouted.\n“Lord! Please live a long life!”\n“… thank you.”\nChun Yeowun expressed his gratitude with red eyes and pressed the button on the time pack.\nIf he hesitated more, he would never be able to leave them.\nWooong!\nIntense energy rose from the time pact that enveloped his body instantly.\nShhh!\nOn where Chun Yeowun stood, only white particles scattered telling he had left.\nChun Yeowun opened his eyes.\nIt felt like a dream. The familiar energy from nature surrounding him was so abundant.\nIt felt like there was tremendous energy once again.\n‘Am I really back?’\nEven though the energy around him gave him the answer, it was hard to believe. And then came the sound of something moving in the bushes behind.\nPhat!\nThen, a person jumped at him from there. The moment Chun Yeowun saw the person, his eyes trembled.\n“Lord!”\nThe first voice he heard called him.\nChun Yeowun’s eyes reddened as he heard the voice he desperately wanted to hear.\n“Ku.”\nThe person was his lover, Mun Ku.\n“Lord…\nHaa…\n”\nHu Bong with red hair and a hood over the head, Baekgi with the blunt face, Ko Wanghur with his muscles, Hou Sang-hwa with her weapon, Sama Chak, and Cha Tae-kyum were sighing.\nAcross them, Mun Ku came ahead of him and hit him on the chest as she softly cried.\n“\nHuk.\nI was so surprised that you suddenly disappeared. Where have you been for three days?”\n‘Three days?’\nIt was time when Chun Yeowun disappeared. A few months were just three days here.\nHu Bong spoke with a smile.\n“\nHihi.\nI told you not to worry.”\n“Don’t act so cheeky.”\nBaekgi, with his blunt face, looked at Hu Bong as if he was pathetic. Their faces intersect with the ones of the future ones.\nDrop!\nMun Ku was shocked.\n“\nUh!\nLord? Are you crying because of something I said?”\nShe looked at Chun Yeowun’s widened eyes. Chun Yeowun looked down at her with wet eyes and hugged her tighter. And thanks to that, Mun Ku’s face was red.\n“L-Lord… they are all here.”\nMun Ku whispered, feeling a bit embarrassed, to which Chun Yeowun said with a smile,\n“Wait… just another minute like this.”\nAlthough he said that, Chun Yeowun wanted to say something more to her.\n‘I really wanted to see you.’\nThe three days he disappeared.\nIt was a story not recorded in the history of the 24th Lord of the Sky Demon Order, who unified the Murim lands for the first time.\nIn a wet cave in darkness, a man with bright red eyes sharpened his sword.\nWith a bandage on the chest, he mumbled the same thing repeatedly.\n“I need to kill. I need to kill them all.”\nAnyone could understand the intent. It was hatred, resentment, and murder.\nThen someone spoke.\n“I see you are here.”\nThe red-eyed man turned his head in surprise. Although injured, he wasn’t the careless kind, but he couldn’t feel this man till now.\nShhh!\nHe raised the sword which he was sharpening. And the man who came into the cave, whose face couldn’t be seen, said,\n“I have no resentment towards you right now, but I am not the kind to leave gaps just because of that.”\n“What are you talking about?!”\nPhat!\nThe red-eyed man brought a red hue onto the sword and went for the man blocking the cave entrance, but his sword stopped mid-air.\n‘H-How can this be?’\nNo matter how much internal energy he used, he couldn’t move the weapon.\nThe red-eyed man shouted in surprise.\n“You! Who are you?”\nAt that question, the face of the man was seen. He has fair skin and is tall. The man drew the sword towards the red-eyed man and said,\nSlash!\n“Demon God.”",

      "content": "Chapter 232: Epilogue (1)\nMun Ku\n— was a descendant of the Demon Dragon Palm clan of the Sky Demon Order.\nShe is the only woman in Chun Yeowun’s heart.\nThe story of how they met rivals the tale of the Butterfly Lovers.\nIn a cave with many talismans attached to it, someone was looking through the gap of the whip wrapped around her face. She stared endlessly at the thick entrance covered with a barrier.\nHow long does she have to be locked up?\nDoes she have to be in pain forever?\nDespite having so many questions, no one could answer her. The wounds on her heart that had lost the only refuge she had couldn’t be forgotten even after a thousand years.\nInstead, death seemed like the only way out.\nShe looked at the door, which looked like it would never open…\nShap!\nThe cape with amulets opened.\n‘T-the door?’\nHer eyes sharpened when she saw the stone wall crack.\nWho is it?\nIs it the descendant of the ancestor who imprisoned her?\nShe didn’t know what it was but hoped to be able to get out of that damned barrier.\nThud!\nSomeone walked in through that cracked door.\nShe could see the person who came in with slow steps.\n‘Is he a descendent of that sage?’\nThe young man had very fair skin and sharp eyes; he looked different from that old man. Instead, he seemed closer to the dark side than the good side.\n‘Dangerous.’\nShe felt a strong ominous feeling coming from him.\nIt was the first time she felt such intimidation since ancient times. Even the man who was her safe haven wasn’t like this.\nShh!\nThen, the dangerous-looking man reached out.\nWheik!\nAll the talismans were burned and flew all around the place. The whip that was binding her was also released.\n‘He is very powerful.’\nShe pondered for a moment.\n‘Should I attack?’\nHowever, she wasn’t confident enough to fight as she wasn’t fully recovered. Then, should she seduce him so he’d let her go?\nEventually, she made up her mind.\nWoong!\nHer body shrank with a golden light. Turning into a beautiful naked woman, she approached the man to try and seduce him.\n“How did you get here—”\n“It doesn’t matter.”\n“Huh?”\nThe man smiled and put his hand on her forehead.\n“Huh?”\nWoooong!\nShe was startled as the massive yokai energy entered her body, but she didn’t shake it off as it felt very familiar.\nThis was her energy.\nAs soon as the energy wrapped around her body, numerous illusions spread into her mind.\n‘This?’\nThe image of the man in front of her was going through her mind. It felt vaguely familiar for their first meeting.\n[Chun Ma… even if you tell me not to, I will come.]\n[Sure.]\n[You are so like him.]\n[Even if it isn’t me, you will find a shelter.]\n[It means nothing without you.]\nHer hesitating and then the slight kiss on the lips engulfed her mind.\nAnd speaking softly.\n[Think of that as me.]\nThe sadness rushed after that. The man smiling in front of her acted like he was okay with her crossing the line. She felt pain in her heart.\nShhh!\nThe yokai energy that came from the man ultimately settled in her body. She staggered and raised her head.\nShe hugged him as she burst into tears.\n“Chun Ma!!!!”\nThis man was Chun Yeowun, the second haven she was longing for.\nAnd that haven came for her.\nChun Yeowun, who looked at her, shook his head.\n“I knew this would happen.”\nHe was someone who didn’t know that yokai energy could contain memories. The Gumiho smiled broadly at Chun Yeowun, making her look more beautiful.\n“I knew you would come back.”\nShe found her light in the endless darkness and was the happiest woman in the world.\nAngel’s Corner\nTHE END!!!\nJust kidding. There’s more—like twelve chapters more.",

      "content": "Chapter 233: Epilogue (2)\nAfter many years had passed, the Sky Demon Order was still standing in the midst of waves and winds.\nShh!\nThe sound of the last-page turning was heard.\n[What happened on the three days of his disappearance is an incident not recorded in the history of Chun Yeowun, the 24th Lord of Sky Demon Order, who unified the Murim for the first time.]\nThen, water dropped on the book the boy was holding.\nDrip!\n“\nAh!\n”\nThe boy in robes was startled and wiped the tears from the book with his sleeve. He was worried that the paper would get torn as he wiped, so he checked.\nAnd fortunately, the book was okay. Then he mumbled in disbelief.\n“Why the hell is this book here?”\nThe boy looked around.\nThis was a story room on the last floor of the Sky Demon Order’s records hall. The boy who discovered this book felt tranced and read it until night.\n“Why didn’t grandpa never tell me of this?”\nThis was something he had never heard of.\nHe was a boy who often stopped by the hall with his great grandfather, who recently passed away.\n“Future? Vehicles? I cannot imagine.”\nAs he read the text, he wondered if such a world existed.\nWould anyone believe it?\nDespite reading it all, the first thing he thought was…\n‘No can know the truth.’\nIt felt strange thinking about it. Had such a thing been there, it would have been an uproar.\nIt seemed like a nonsensical story. However, reading this made him want to see his great grandfather.\n“Grandpa…”\nWho would have known that a man who reached immortality had passed? Yet, none of the members of the Sky Demon Order could accept the fact.\nShh!\nThe boy who looked at the book thought…\n‘Shall I take it?’\nIt was against the rules, but leaving a book about his great grandfather here would be a waste.\nWhile he was contemplating it, someone came to him.\n“Young Master Chun.”\n“Ah!”\nStartled at the woman’s voice, the boy hid the book behind him. Looking back, he saw a beautiful woman standing there.\nThe woman sighed with a frown.\n“Do you think I cannot see it because you are hiding it from my eyes?”\n“B-But…”\n“The books can only be read here. Aren’t you familiar with the rule? In the past, people would memorize everything and leave the books.”\nThe boy was shocked at her and showed her the book he was hiding. When he handed it, it was evident that he felt bad.\n“Young Master Chun.”\nJust then, someone waiting outside showed up. Wearing a mask with a unique pattern, it was the Great Guardian, Marasung.\n“Great Guardian?”\n“The Lord is looking for you.”\n“Ahh…”\nHe was going to ask if it was fine to keep the book with him just for a little while, but now that the Great Guardian was here, he couldn’t do that.\nThe woman smiled and said,\n“I need to work. Young Master Chun, please go meet the Lord.”\n“\nUhhhh\n, fine.”\nHe was sad he couldn’t keep it.\nHe couldn’t take it, but he knew where this book would be.\n“I will come again.”\n“Sure.”\nAs his steps turned lighter, he felt like he alone knew the secrets of his great grandfather.\nBut he noticed something strange.\n‘Was there a woman working on the last floor of the record hall?’\nHe didn’t see one before.\nThud!\nAnd at that time, the door was closed shut. The boy, who was contemplating, eventually followed the Great Guardian down the stairs.\nTak!\nThen there was a sound of something being scratched at the stone of sapphire located in the middle of the hall, which was tightly shut.\nSomeone was standing there with one hand behind his back and the other hand engraving something on the stone.\nThe sapphire stone, which should have been difficult to cut, had something written on it by hand.\nIt was strange that neither the boy nor the Great Guardian, who visited the place, didn’t seem to notice the existence of this person.\nThe woman, who sent the boy away, approached him from behind. The beautiful woman held onto the book then a fire flared out from her hand, burning it.\nWheik!\nThe treasure the boy would come to find again was now just ashes.\n“I am deeply moved at the thought of that grandchild, Chun Ma.”\nAs she took a step ahead, her tied black hair was untied and turned golden. In addition, her eyes were also now gold.\nShe was none other than the Golden Gumiho.\nTuktuk!\nThe person who was inscribing something on the sapphire stone lifted his hand. And, of course, that person was Chun Yeowun.\nThe Golden Gumiho approached him with a smile and said,\n“He said he wasn’t going to tell that to anyone. I wanted someone to remember that.”\nAt that, Chun Yeowun leaned back and said,\n“Because that is what truly lives forever.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, the Golden Gumiho stayed silent and then said with a smile,\n“As expected, you are so similar.”\n“You have been saying that for a hundred years.”\n“\nHuh.\nAnd I plan to do it always.”\nChun Yeowun shook his head. Her body shined in gold as she turned into a baby fox. Then she went up onto Chun Yeowun’s shoulder.\n“You are officially dead. Where will we go now?”\nAt her question, Chun Yeowun grinned as he answered.\n“Beyond the border?”\n“Beyond the border?”\n“He is waiting there.”\nAt those words, Gumiho's eyes widened cutely. Either way, when Chun Yeowun waved his hands, the scattered sapphire particles vanished, and so did they.\nA whispering voice came out from her as they were disappearing from there.\n“Chun Ma, is your ancestor there?”\n“Why? Do you want to go there now?”\n“Oh my! What am I to do? Two men will fight for me! Hehe.”\n“I was waiting for a hundred years to let you go.”\n“So mean!”\nThen the two people in the hall vanished, leaving the place in silence.",

      "content": "Chapter 234: Side Story (1)\nIn the dark forest…\n“\nGasp… Gasp…\n”\nAn old man was bleeding from a stab wound in his abdomen. With how he is bleeding right now, It wouldn’t be strange to just die.\nExhaling painful gasps, the old man looked at the white-haired middle-aged man standing in front of him with frightened eyes.\n“\nGasp… Gasp…\nwhy are you doing… this?”\nEven though it was midsummer, the white-haired man was giving out a weird coldness from his body, and the energy from him overwhelmed the surroundings.\nThen, with cold eyes, he asked,\n“Where is it?”\n“W-what are you talking about?”\nThe white-haired man smiled and gently stepped close to where the old man had staggered.\nCrack!\nThe sound of the bones of the foot of the old man cracking was heard.\n“\nAcck!\n”\nThe old man groaned in pain, to which the white-haired one spoke without a change in his expression.\n“You don’t know what your clan has been hiding from generations?”\nThe old man’s face hardened hearing that question. His swaying eyes showed how shocked he was.\n“I’ll help you make a choice.”\nThe white-haired man pulled something out of his arms, a jade ring.\n“T-that!”\nThe old man’s eyes widened.\n“There were quite a few in the Hyanga village, and your granddaughter is getting married soon, right?”\n“You bastard! Aren’t you afraid of karma—\ncough!\n’\nThe old man yelled and coughed a handful of blood. It was natural for him to cough blood since he was stabbed.\nStill, the white-haired man just calmly spoke.\n“If I was afraid of that, I wouldn’t have done such things. With just one gesture of me, your family will be on their way to the underworld.”\nThe white-haired man raised his hand, which made a torch flicker from a distance. It was a signal.\nThe old man, who looked at it, spoke. To which the white-haired man’s eyes lit up as he achieved his goal.\n“I-I told you, so let my family live….”\nThe sight of the old man begging made the white-haired one smile bitterly and say,\n“Ah! I forgot. Your family isn’t in this world any longer.”\n“You–bastard—\ncough!\n”\nThe old man screaming in anger seemed to have exhausted his life. He grabbed his chest as he suffered in pain and collapsed.\n“I don’t need to get my hands dirty.\nHuh.\n”\nPhat!\nThe white-haired man immediately left the forest with his work done. The old man, who was staring blankly, mumbled.\n“…Dead… shouldn’t…. be woken….”\nHundred Thousand Mountains.\nIt is a place where numerous mountains are located. However, when people talk about it now, it isn’t for the mountains but for the Great Sky Demon Order.\nIt is the sacred site of the cult that unified the Murim. It was no exaggeration to say that this world was in the grasp of the Sky Demon Order. All the clans and minor clans absorbed into the Sky Demon Order were doing their best. Now, they were being supported as the state religion too.\nIn a small training hall in the cult…\nPapak!\nFrom the early morning, a violent pounding sound could be heard.\n“My heart hurts, Young Lord!”\n“\nHuh!\n”\nHearing the cry from the man with a scar on his back, the boy, who looked to be around 17 or 19 years old, moved back. But then, suddenly, the man kicked his chest.\nPak!\n“\nEuk!\n”\nThe boy who was hit by the kick fell back, and blood dripped down his lips as if he had suffered minor internal wounds.\nShhh!\nThe boy, who was bewildered by it, said to the man with scars,\n“E-Elder Baek. That was too much—”\n“This is training.”\nThe scarred-man cut off the words of the dissatisfied boy.\n“… Master Baek—”\n“In here, it is\nteacher\n.”\n“Yes, yes. Well, teacher. Still, I am the Young Lord of the clan. Aren’t we overdoing the training?”\nThe boy who was the Young Lord of the cult was Chun Woo-myung, the child who will become the next Lord of the Sky Demon Order.\nIn response to his words, the one called Baek shook his head.\n“Lord will be rather strict about the training….”\n“Not that, you haven’t taught me that kick right? If there was such a thing, you should have taught me!”\nAt those words, the teacher seemed proud. As the Young Lord, Chun Woo-myung wasn’t the kind to run away from his duties. For some reason, it felt like the child was sad whenever he wasn’t taught anything.\nThen, he heard a muffled sound.\n“\nKuk.\nAs expected of our Young Lord. Your progress in close combat is great.”\nChun Woo-myung turned back as he shouted with a bright face.\n“Uncle Hu!”\n“Young Lord.”\nThe man with long red hair was called Uncle Hu. It was Hu Bong.\nHu Bong bowed his head and greeted. At his appearance, the man called teacher Baek said,\n“You need to call him—”\n“You are really strict on everything. Elder Baek.”\n“Don’t you dare talk to me like that, Hu Bong.”\n“You must mean best subordinate, Baekgi.”\nThe man called Elder Baek was Baekgi. He was the Clan Leader of the Pure Kick clan, the 5th Elder of the Sky Demon Order, and a master for the Young Lord of the cult in close combat.\n“\nPhew.\nNo matter how old you are… no. Forget it.”\nBaekgi decided to not say it out loud. At that, Hu Bong smiled and spoke to Chun Woo-myung.\n“With your force, in a couple of years it wouldn’t be hard to defeat the Elder Baek.\nHehe.\n”\n“How many years?”\nChun Woo-myung frowned at the mention of years. He has been at this with Baekgi for two years already.\n‘I am not confident in using the Sword Force of the Sky Demon….’\nThat was his honest opinion. At the age of 17, this gifted man passed the academy.\nEven so, if all the people in the cult related to close combat were ranked, for sure, this young man would be in the top 20. Elder Baek thought that too.\n‘King of Lightning.’\nBaekgi was known to be the King of Lightning. He was one of the Six Swords of the Demon God Chun Yeowun, the best in Murim.\nAnd right now, only Ko Wanghur was someone who could go against Baekgi with bare hands.\n‘Phew. For name, I am the Young Lord of the cult, but it is so embarrassing.’\nChun Woo-myung was a Young Lord who had no confidence in defeating any of the Six Swords, even if he used the Sword Force of the Sky Demon. Of course, he was well aware that this wasn’t a matter of strength and weakness of martial arts.\nThe Sword Force of the Sky Demon is the best swordsmanship. Chun Yeowun, his father and the Lord, had the strength to cut down everyone and spread the Sword Force of the Sky Demon with even a leaf.\n‘… he really cut it.’\nFor example, there was a time Chun Yeowun cut down a peak of a mountain using a branch. At that, Chun Woo-myung wondered if he could surpass his father’s limit.\n“Enough. The training isn’t done yet. Get out.”\nBaekgi decided to chase out Hu Bong, who smiled and said,\n“What do I do? I came because of the Lord's Order.”\n“…?”\n“Father?”\n“Yes. For Lord.”\n“What’s the order?”\n“Today is finally that day, Young Lord.”\n“That day?”\nChun Woo-myung was puzzled at first and was soon in joy as he understood what Hu Bong was saying. It is finally the day he had been waiting for.\n“At least!”\n“Yes. It is\nthat day\n, the day when this Hu Bong will accompany the Young Lord to the sanctuary.”\nThree months had passed since his request. Finally, the day came when he could go and see the sanctuary where his past ancestors were. And this was an opportunity to go around the place. This was the day he had been waiting for.\nHu Bong smiled and said,\n“Hurry up and go to the Lord.”\nIn the Sky Demon Order main training hall’s basement that was a place for the Lord…\nThe floor and walls were all made with sapphire to make it more potent than any training hall.\nWell, the whole area was filled with sapphire.\nShhh!\nBlurring afterimages moved there, constantly avoiding the Invisible Swords.\nChak!\nThe Invisible Swords followed the afterimages as if they were alive. And the afterimages, which barely managed to avoid it, suddenly flew back and to the center of the training hall.\nShhh!\n“\nHah!\n”\nAs the images darkened, the man who appeared moved his sword to the man who had his back to him. And a black line appeared in the air. There was a sharp sound along with the line and the sound of air being torn.\nCrack!\nSeeing that, the other man smiled. While the other’s back was still facing him, he lightly stepped on the floor.\nThud!\nAnd soon, the space around distorted, and the black line was sucked in. At the same time, the man who used the sword bounced back.\n“\nAck!\n”\nBang!\nThe man slammed into the wall. He groaned at the pain, which felt like his entire body would break down, but how easily the sword was blocked was even more absurd.\n‘I have always known, but he is such a monster.’\nHe bit his tongue and lifted his head while looking at the one walking toward him. The man has sharp eyes and fair skin.\nDespite the many years, he still looked the same. He was Chun Yeowun, the Lord of the Sky Demon Order.\n“You are just getting used to it. Still useful.”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s words, the man barely got up and said,\n“Didn’t you stop it with just a single hand though? Ancestor.”\nThe man who called him ancestor was Chun Mu-seong, the descendant from the future.\n“At your level, you won’t die so quickly.”\n“\nUgh…\n”\nHe was talking to Chun Yeowun, the man who never compliments others. Chun Mu-seong could imagine just how much strength was being controlled by Chun Yeowun to train him.\n“I am not sure if the Supreme Sky Demon Sword will even work on the ancestor at all.”\nYes, that shocking name was said by Chun Mu-seong.\nSupreme Sky Demon Sword technique.\nIt was the strongest sword created by their ancestor, Chun Ma. It was the only sword that could cut and destroy anything, even the immortal things.\nDescendant Chun Mu-seong was finally able to learn it after nearly 19 years of hellish training from Chun Yeowun, who is the strongest.\n“If in this in level, then you should be fine.”\n“Really?”\nChun Mu-seong was skeptical, and it was natural. It was said that this was a technique that could stop anything with one slash—except Chun Yeowun. So, Chun Mu-seong wasn’t sure of his growth.\n“If you are anxious, you can learn for another 10 years?”\n“T-that…”\nIn an instant, Chun Mu-seong’s face turned pale. He was the one who spent 19 years here. And another 10 years of hellish training sounded like early death.\n“If you aren’t confident in yourself, then learn more.”\nChun Yeowun, who said that, looked like a devil to Chun Mu-seong.\n“Ah, no. Now that I think, this should be enough. I think the time has come!”\nChun Mu-seong refused by waving his hands.\nChun Yeowun smiled.\n“If you change your mind, tell me. I will make you reach the level of the Blade God.”\nAt that, Chun Mu-seong thought.\n‘… if ancestor says it, then it could be done.’\nThe Blade God was called the God of martial arts in his world. His heart was troubled when he thought of fighting beings that were respected.\nHowever, these days, he doesn't feel that anymore. Maybe because he was battling with a more fearful entity each day.\n“Well, I still have time to spare. Want another match?”\n‘Shit!’\nChun Mu-seong’s face turned pale at the suggestion.\nKnock!\nThen came the knock on the door.\n‘I will live!’\nChun Mu-seong hid his feelings and said,\n“Ah… this is so sad, but I think someone is looking for Ancestor.”\nChun Yeowun shook his head as if he knew his descendant’s thoughts.\nThe man had gone through extremes and pushed his limit just to come to this level. He didn’t want to fight more.\n“Come in.”\nThe door opened at Chun Yeowun’s voice.\nThe one who entered it was Marakim.\n“Lord.”\n“Did the Young Lord and Hu Bong arrive?”\n“No.”\n“Then what is it?”\n“A message from the capital.”\n“From the Imperial City?”\nAfter the unification of Murim, the Imperial Palace sent envoys to the Sky Demon Order. It was like a ritual event. However, it was once every six months; this one was three months earlier.\n“Oh?”\nHu Bong and Chun Woo-myung were in the main room, inside more of the Sky Demon Order. They were puzzled at the appearance of three women waiting there for them.\nChun Woo-myung went to greet them.\n“Did you sleep well last night?”\n‘Woo-myung.’\nShe was a woman with long black hair and a beautiful smile.\nShe seemed to be in her mid-20s at her appearance, but it was Mun Ku, mother of Chun Woo-myung.\n“Mother.”\n“You came here without taking a bath?”\nHe indeed did run here with the dust still on him.\n“He seems to be excited about it, sister.”\nThe silver-haired woman smiled at him. She was Wang Yeogun, the daughter of Wang Jin and the second wife of the Lord.\n“Tell me about it, little sister.”\n“No, second mother. I came in a hurry since this was important, and….well, I was a bit excited to—”\nGrab!\n“\nUmp\n!”\nBefore he could finish, one of the women grabbed his cheeks. She was a slim woman with blonde hair and golden eyes.\n“It would be so nice if you could smile till your ears, but your mouth is being used only to speak. You. You are turning more like your father each day.”\n“A-Aunt!”\nChun Woo-myung was flustered at it. This blonde beauty in front of him was the person who made his life difficult.\nShe was the Golden Gumiho. The woman everyone called as the unofficial third wife of the Lord since she never leaves his side.\nShe, too, wanted to be called that, but she didn’t get permission from Chun Yeowun, so she is just the aunt of the Young Lord.\n“L-let me go.”\n“No. I don’t want to. Call me mother and I will.”\nAt her naughty words, Chun Woo-myung was flustered.\n“A-Aunt!”\nNot knowing anything, he couldn’t disobey the orders of his father. As he was being stubborn, the Gumiho looked disappointed.\n“You could have just called me mother.\nTch.\n”\nMun Ku and Wang Yeogun smiled at her complaining. They knew this fox's love for Chun Yeowun wasn’t like theirs.\nHu Bong, who came in, asked Mun Ku with a puzzled face.\n“Lady.

      "content": "Chapter 235: Side Story (2)\nChun Yeowun was reading the letter while sitting at the highest seat in the entire room.\nMen ten steps away from him were focused on looking at his reaction to the content he was reading.\nWhile still his eyes on the letter, one eyebrow of Chun Yeowun raised to which the messengers all bowed their heads.\n“This letter… isn’t from the Emperor.”\nAt those words from him, Lee Hameng, who was now growing a red beard, asked,\n“It wasn’t sent by the Emperor?”\nChun Yeowum handed it to him. After he confirmed it with his own eyes, he yelled.\n“How dare you deceive the Lord?!”\n“Eik!”\nSome terrified people panicked, not knowing what to do. They deceived them by saying the letter was from the Emperor and requested an audience with the Lord of Sky Demon Order.\nSo they couldn’t help but accept the shouting.\n“\nHuhuhu\n. Fearless bastards.”\nSubmeng, who was on the other side with a flask on his waist, clicked his tongue. One of the messengers who were kneeling got up. It was a man in a blue uniform.\n“We haven’t lied to you. We were sure that we said we were from the Imperial Family when we visited. We never mentioned that this was a letter from His Majesty.”\nThe voice was full of nobility that showed where his confidence was coming from.\nLee Hameng yelled again.\n“Haa!”\nThe man in blue was playing with words fearlessly.\nChun Yeowun looked at him.\n“Your name is Lee Yun, right?”\nThis man called himself Lee Yun. In the empire, he held the title of a teacher for the Crown Prince.\nChun Yeowun was puzzled when he saw this man had accompanied the envoy.\n“Yes, Lord.”\n“Do you know the contents of the letter?”\nLee Yun confidently answered.\n“I do.”\nHe indeed was the man who conquered the world, but this was Chun Yeowun’s first time seeing someone standing confidently and looking so dignified in front of him. Of course, it could be possible since the man before him was a teacher, a scholar honing his knowledge.\nChun Yeowun laughed.\nLee Yun raised his voice with a displeased face.\n“That is a letter from the person who will become the Lord of the nation. Even if the cult is in charge of the National Religion of the Empire, you are too much.”\nNational Religion.\nChun Yeowun made the National Religion of the Empire as Sky Demon Order, and Lee Yun was very uncomfortable with that.\nDid it make sense for the empire which rules the people and keeps other nations in check to set the Sky Demon Order as the religion? And even discuss state affairs with them?\n“Just because you are—”\nIt was when he was trying to speak.\nThud!\nLee Yun was forced to kneel in an instant by Lee Hameng, who was next to Chun Yeowun but suddenly appeared behind him and pressed him down.\n“\nKuak…\n”\nLee Yun was flustered. There was no way he could withstand the power of a warrior.\n“The Lord didn’t give you permission to stand.”\n“Is it… fine to threaten the Imperial Palace?“\nLee Yun looked at Chun Yeowun and protested. However, Chun Yeowun just flicked the letter.\nPak!\nIt was shocking. A simple letter of paper stuck firmly on the floor. Lee Yun’s knee would have been cut if it stuck a little farther.\nDrop!\nAnd cold sweat began to drop.\nTo Lee Yun, Chun Yeowun calmly said,\n“It is cute that the Prince who hasn’t even been crowned, is already pretending to be the master of the nation. He’s ordering me to come to the palace?”\nThe letter said that an urgent matter had to be discussed by the Crown Prince, who would be the Emperor, so Chun Yeowun had to come to the palace.\nAt that, Lee Yun thought.\n‘Cute?’\nThe arrogance of this man when talking about the Crown Prince!\n“News has spread, and only a few can attend the coronation. That is an insulting remark to the Prince…\nump!\n”\nHe couldn’t finish his sentence as his mouth was shut. His chin didn’t move as if someone was firmly holding it.\n“\nEup!\n”\n“Shut up. Well, this is good. I do miss what that brat Zhu Tae-gyeom is up to.”\n‘Brat?’\nLee Yun was baffled at what he had just heard. This man was speaking about the leader of the Empire, not just a Crown Prince, and treated as if the Crown Prince was below him. Actually, it shocked him as this was his first meeting with Chun Yeowun.\n“\nUpupup!\n”\n“Get out.”\nAfter Chun Yeowun’s orders, Lee Hameng gestured to the left, and the warriors and escorts from there came and took the envoy out.\nBe it the Imperial envoy or anything; everything was equal to them.\n“W-we are the Imperial!”\n“Why are you doing this? We are the envoy… let me go!”\nEven the other officials who didn’t know the letter's content were confused. Yet, they were dragged out like prisoners.\nAfter they left, Submeng smiled.\n“\nKukkuk\n. Right. I suggested that we create a new dynasty, but for what purpose did you decide to stay here, Lord?”\nIt wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the power of the Sky Demon Order couldn’t be compared to others. Going to create another nation wasn’t an arduous task. Submeng and the other elders also said that they should create something new.\nHowever, Chun Yeowun wasn’t interested in it.\n“Lord!”\nAt that time, the voice of a woman was heard. Chun Yeowun got up with a soft smile.\n‘Kukkuk, look at him.’\nSubmeng thought to himself. In the past, Chun Yeowun would never smile unless it was a special occasion, but he was different in front of his family.\n“My wife.”\nEspecially to his first wife, Mun Ku, he was the kindest.\n“Lord.”\nDespite not being newlyweds, those two people still held affection in their eyes.\nChun Woo-myung coughed.\n“\nEhem\n.”\n“You’re here.”\n“Yes, father.”\nChun Woo-myung smiled brightly and answered.\nThis was a scene of a harmonious family that was never seen in the Sky Demon Order.\nMarakim, Lee Hameng, and Submeng watched it in delight.\nThe enormous amount of children and the rivalry to bring out the best of them were all changed by Chun Yeowun.\n“Chun Ma, you don’t even see us.”\n“Right.”\nThe Golden Gumiho spoke in disappointment, and Wang Yeogun nodded.\n“It can never be that, Lady Wang.”\nChun Yeowun smiled, trying to comfort Yeogun.\nThe Golden Gumiho crossed her arms and said,\n“Say that to me too.\n‘Wifeeee.’\n”\n“… let go.”\nChun Yeowun smiled at her.\n“\nTch tch.\nNothing works for you.”\nWhen her attempt was unsuccessful, the Golden Gumiho frowned. But Chun Yewun didn’t care. People around him also had been watching this for 19 years.\n“Iron wall. Iron wall.”\nIgnoring the Golden Gumiho, Chun Yeowun spoke to his son.\n“Today is the day.”\nChun Woo-myung’s face brightened. Today is the long-awaited visit.\nAfter attending the academy, the last child who left the Sky Demon Order was with his father.\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun put his hand into the shadow and pulled something out. What emerged was a sword.\n“Ahh!”\nIt was a famous sword whose body shone in white light. Chun Yeowun passed it to Chun Woo-myung.\n“This?”\n“This is your sword. It was made from the spine of the White Tiger, a spirit beast.”\n“Father!”\nChun Woo-myung, who never received a sword as a gift, felt emotional.\nIt felt like he was being acknowledged as a warrior.\n“Is that all?”\nChun Yeowun didn’t respond to Mun Ku’s words. Despite being so gentle with his family, his bluntness didn’t disappear. To which Mun Ku said,\n“Why are you being so modest? Woo-myung, that sword, your father made it for you.”\n“Father made it?”\nRight. Chun Yeowun made that sword. Initially, he was planning to give it at a later time when he graduated from the academy, but the child came out early.\nStill, Chun Woo-myung was impressed with this.\n“Father…”\nChun Woo-myung was trying to say his gratitude, but then one of the guards said,\n“Lord, 3rd Elder and 7th Elder have arrived.”\n“I see.”\nChun Woo-myung was puzzled at Chun Yeowun’s words. He knew that the Elders weren’t called to this place.\nThe door opened, and a muscular middle-aged man with a long beard came in.\nThey were the 3rd Elder Ko Wanghur and the 7th Elder Hou Sanghwa.\nSince the establishment of the cult, they were the only ones who were a couple and Elders at the same time.\nThe people went inside and bowed to Chun Yeowun.\nPak!\nAnd they weren’t the only ones who came.\n“3rd Elder greets the Lord.”\n“7th Elder greets the Lord.”\nThere was still a person behind them but was obscured by the two, who were huge and muscular.\nThe person who looked like a man bowed and said,\n“16th Elder, Ko Wang-suk, greets the Lord.”\nA pure and beautiful voice came out far from her appearance. Surprisingly, it was a\nhe\nr, not\nhim\n!\n“Ko Wang-suk…”\nChun Woo-myung frowned at her.\nLooking at the outside appearance, it seemed like this person was the perfect son of Ko Wanghur, but this person was a woman.\nShe was Ko Wang-suk, the eldest daughter of the couple.\n“Get up.”\nWhen Chun Yeowun said it, the three got up and came close.\n“\nKuak.\nYou look so reliable whenever I see you.”\nWhen Hu Bong said that to her, Ko Wanghur laughed.\n“\nHahaha,\nit is because she resembles me.”\nThey seemed too similar. The first daughter resembled her father.\nChun Yeowun looked at his son.\n‘This kid.’\nChun Woo-myung couldn’t take his eyes off her. It wasn’t because she was a woman but like a rival. Ko Wang-suk was the first to graduate from the academy in their generation. With the body of a man, she had her father's talent and was now the 16th Elder too!\nThanks to that, Chun Woo-myung graduated second, and his heart burned every time he saw her.\nShhh!\nOn the other hand, Ko Wang-suk couldn’t look at Chun Woo-myung. She had the face of a woman in love.\nChun Woo-myung asked.\n“Father, why are the Elders… here?”\nHe wondered why his father called the Elders.\nKo Wanghur smiled.\n“\nHahaha.\nYoung Lord, my daughter will also come along with you on your journey.”\n“Huh?”\nHe was shocked at what he had heard. He thought he was only going with Hu Bong, but now this was horrible!\nA little flustering, Ko Wang-suk said,\n“I will dedicate myself to taking care of the Young Lord.\nKyak!\n”\nHide!\nAfter finishing her sentence, Ko Wang-suk hurriedly hid behind her father.\n“\nHahaha,\nour 16th Elder is acting shy as she wil be leaving with the Young Lord. I am worried as a young man and woman are going together. What do I do if you fall for her? No…hahaha.”\n“Ah, father!”\nThud! Thud!\nKo Wang-suk hit her father on the back while he just patted his daughter. The sound seemed like drums were beating.\nChun Woo-myung, looking at them, didn’t feel good. Hu Bong, who was next to him, said,\n“I will protect you.”\nWhat could he do?\nHe just looked at Hu Bong silently.",

      "content": "Chapter 236: Side Story (3)\nNorthwest of Guangxi.\nHocho is a small peaceful village located on the crossing. The village is so small that it consists of just 60 houses.\n“Oh my, the Young Lord is here?”\nThe villagers came out to meet the Young Lord of the Sky Demon Order. These villagers are also members of the cult.\nA person was nodding with an awkward smile looking at the people. It was Chun Woo-myung, the Sky Demon Order’s Young Lord.\n‘Ahh…’\nThere was a disappointment in his eyes. On the three days of their trip, they went to three villages and were greeted by their cult members.\n‘It shouldn’t be like this….’\nThe trip he expected wasn’t like this, but an adventure. He wanted to make new friends from other places, meet an enemy, and perhaps even have a hidden lover. However, this situation was very different from what he had imagined.\n“I am Baek Woong. The head of the cult branch here.”\n“Hehe, please look after me.”\nThere would always be a branch of the Sky Demon Order wherever he went. As a result, those handling it would come to meet him and give him comfortable places to stay in. His wish for romance and adventure feels unachievable.\n‘Ahhh.’\nActually, this was expected.\nThe present Murim is unified. Him being an adventurous Murim warrior that he imagined would never exist in a world where almost all people are members of their cul!\n‘No! this isn’t it!’\n“Young Lord?”\nWang-suk, who was there with him, seemed puzzled at the expression he was making.\n“\nAh\n—nothing.”\n“It cannot be ‘nothing.’ Are you hurt somewhere? If you are ill, I can look after you all night—”\n“Absolutely not!”\nChun Woo-myung shook his head at her for being selfless. He didn't know her at the academy, but three days with her taught him all there was to know about her.\n‘She is dangerous.’\nHe knew why Hu Bong was determined to protect him from this girl. Ko Wang-suk was aiming for some alone time with him.\n“\nEhh.\nYou can just tell me if you’re feeling sick or if you’re hurt, we were schoolmates before.”\nKo Wang-suk was twisting her body which made her muscles bulge.\n‘Creepy!’\nChun Woo-myung trembled and looked out.\nThere, he saw several warriors with swords on them. He wasn’t sure because there was no clan symbol on it, but he was interested as it was his first time seeing something like that ever since they went out.\n“Hmm… uncle?”\n“Ah, yes?”\nHe called Hu Bong, who was talking with the branch head, and looked.\n“Why don’t we stay at an inn instead for today?”\n“Inn? We have a branch here. We would have to pay for staying….”\nHu Bong didn’t end his words. He was the one who raised Chun Woo-myung like a real nephew, so he wasn’t ignorant to Chun Woo-myung’s eyes that were saying he wanted something.\n“\nAigoo.\nShall we enjoy the dinner there?”\n“\nAhh\n! Uncle is so nice!”\nChun Woo-myung was at a loss for the agreement. Only Baek Woong was flustered.\n‘Huh? Do they not like me?’\nThe branch head was there because he was assigned to welcome the cult’s leaders. And he had to impress Chun Woo-myung, who would be the next Lord.\n“Y-Young Lord, we have invited the best chef here, and we are preparing the dinner—”\n[Um, Branch Head.]\nHu Bong sent a message to him. And after a brief talk, he backed down with a sad expression.\nKo Wang-suk, who was puzzled, began to like the idea of staying in the inn.\n‘If we won’t be staying in the cult’s branch, there will be more chances for me.’\nShe was a young girl who was in love with the Young Lord. As a girl, she felt a bit intimidated.\nAfter they separated ways, Chun Woo-myung began to approach the inn.\n“From now, we are\njust\na\nsmall clan’s people,\nokay?”\n“Yes. Young Lor—Master. hehe”\n“Young Master.”\nThe reason why the request was made was simple. It was to prevent people from approaching them and wasting their time. He was the next Lord of Murim, and they didn’t want the trip to turn into a business trip.\nKik!\n“Come in.”\nAs soon as they entered, the keeper greeted them.\n‘They are…’\nChun Woo-myung saw eight warriors sitting at the table with their swords at their side. Looking at their attire, it looked like animal skin and was also colorful.\n[They look like rogues.]\nHu Bong informed him. He was pretty aware of the sects, so he could guess who they were at a glance.\n‘Uhm. They are those ones.’\nHu Bong’s eyes darkened.\nEven though the Murim was unified, not all were happy with it. Some resisted and refused and turned into rogues.\nAnd some had bad feelings for the Sky Demon Order.\nShh!\nJust as they looked at the eight warriors, the eight looked at them as well.\nAnyone could know that Chun Woo-myung’s party was a party of warriors. In particular, Ko Wang-suk’s build made it obvious.\n“Amazing!”\n“She to be a master!”\n“I don’t think her strength will be normal.”\nPeople were amazed at her. Of course, she was really someone with amazing strength. However, no one saw her as a woman.\nTremble!\nShe didn’t say it, but she was displeased.\n“Guests, please sit here.”\nThe keeper guided them to the empty seats, and Hu Bong spoke with an excited face.\n“Try to fill the table with the best dishes, please!”\n“Oh! Are you serious?”\n“Yes!”\nHu Bong giggled and waved the pouch in his waist. And the keeper, excited to see that, ran into the kitchen.\n“Wasn’t that too much? Uncle.”\n“This table seems big, so they should all fit. Young Master.”\nBut the table wasn’t huge. At best, six dishes would fit on it. The other customers, who were all having simple noodles, looked at them who ordered more.\nAfter a while, the table was filled.\n“\nKuah.\nYoung Master, let’s eat.”\n“Let’s eat, uncle!”\nThroughout the meal, Chun Woo-myung turned and looked at others. Based on the books he read, something had to happen, but this inn was quiet.\nEven the ones drinking were doing their thing quietly.\n‘Ah… this isn’t right.’\nBut these people didn’t seem interested in them. And Chun Woo-myung thought that Ko Wang-suk was the cause of it.\nShe looked very dignified while serving them and eating, but she had muscles that made her look intimidating, making people stay far from them.\n‘Maybe that is why she IS Ko Wang-suk.’\nShe was more than a hundred escorts. Chun Woo-myung was depressed. At this rate, his dream of adventure was going to end lackluster.\nHowever, wasn’t there a saying that goes, ‘if you desperately want it, you will get it?’1\nStep!\nOne of the rogues approached them. Currently talking to his companions, Hu Bong slowly looked at the man.\nTak!\nThe man greeted them.\n“Could I ask for a moment? Leader.”\nThe one he was addressing to wasn’t Hu Bong or Chun Woo-myung but Ko Wang-suk.\n“\nPuah!\n”\nHu Bong was unable to hold back his laughter.\nShe was just 18 and still had to go through a lot of experience. Well, in terms of appearance, it did make sense.\nTremble.\nHer muscles twitched at it. Despite being shy in front of Chun Woo-myung, she was still someone who graduated earlier than the others and defeated other elders at the age of 17!\n“Did you just call me Le—”\n“Calm down, Ko Wang-suk.”\n“Oh my, Young Master.”\nChun Woo-myung grabbed her shoulder to stop her before she made a move, and with that, her expression changed and calmed down.\n“Oh my?”\nThe rogue felt strange at that word that came from her mouth.\n‘What…’\nHe was perplexed and tried to return to his seat, but Chun Woo-myung stopped him.\n“What is it?”\n“Ah.. that…”\nIt seemed like he was thinking of excuses to return.\nClench!\n‘!?’\nAnd his eyes looked at the teacup in Ko Wang-suk’s hands that turned into powder.\nHer hand was twice the size of an average person’s, making the teacup look small. At that time, Ko Wang-suk raised her right hand and acted like she was slicing her neck as a warning to him.\nWsik!\nAnd that meant.\n‘If you… talk… you will die….’\nReading it thoroughly, the man’s thought of escaping disappeared.\n“M-may we ask help from the leader?”\n‘Help!’\nAt those words, Chun Woo-myung’s eyes gleamed.\nThe envoy of the Imperial Family was detained in the Sky Demon Order.\nThey had been locked in this place for three days now, and their faces were exhausted.\nEspecially Lee Yun, who has been the center of why they are still here. He was seated apart from others as they tormented him.\n‘Ah… I couldn’t take a good look at the Crown Prince. Is this where my life ends?’\nHe was even thinking of death.\n“Alert!”\nThe voices of the guards outside were heard.\nThen, the door opened.\n“Lord Chun!”\n“Oh, Lord Chun!”\nThe person who arrived was Chun Yeowun. The officials detained were calling for him as if pleading, worried that he would feel upset if they didn’t.\n‘Kuak!’\nLee Yun couldn’t do that. He turned to the wall and sat quietly, and someone grabbed his shoulder. He thought it was one of his people asking him to beg.\n“How can you beg for….”\n“Oh, really?”\n‘Ahit!’\nIt was Chun Yeowun, and he was thinking about taking back the sentence he attempted to finish saying.\n“What are you talking about?!”\n“Can’t you apologize to the Lord!”\nThe officials were asking him harshly.\n“Does this make sense? The head of a cult disregards the members of the empire….”\nTak!\nBefore he could finish, Chun Yeowun grabbed his head.\n“W-what are you doing?”\n“I guess I will have to meet the Prince who sent you here.”\n“Huh?”\nAhh!\nAs soon as he said that, they disappeared from the room and the other officials looked at the space blankly.\n“They are gone!”\n“How can that happen?”\nAt the center of the Imperial City, where the palace was located, there was a building with golden tiles, and inside it was a throne room where the emperor resided.\nAnd the man sitting in the Emperor’s seat, Zhu Tae-gyeom, was urging someone.\n“What do you mean you sent a letter to the Sky Demon Order?”\n“How could that happen?”\nIn front of him was a 17-year-old boy.\nThe boy wearing a red robe with a dragon pattern was the Crown Prince, Zhu Chi-yun.\n“\nHuh.\nYou must have lost your mind. Only I, the Emperor, have the right to talk or act. Are you trying to make me hate you?”\nEmperor Zhu Tae-gyeom, who found out that Lee Yun wasn’t there and later knew that the man went for Sky Demon Order, took the situation seriously.\nThud!\nZhu Chi-yun knelt, pleading.\n“Father! Father! You are the Supreme Leader of the Empire! Does it make sense to let the Nation’s Religion Holder play such a role?”\nZhu Chi-yun’s words only made Zhu Tae-gyeom turn angrier. He couldn’t understand how his son did such a thing!\nHe never dreamed that such a thing would happen.\n“Prince, you do not know the history of this nation. He is…”\nHe couldn’t speak. How could he say that the monster was the absolute being for him?\n“Father! I just asked for help. If you are worried, you can tell that it was done in your words….”\nSjhh!\nThe space distorted before he could speak, and someone fell into the throne room.\n“\nEuk!\n”\nZhu Chi-yun, who saw the people who suddenly appeared, was shocked.\n“T-teacher!”\nIt was Lee Yun. And someone landed very gently next to him. The Emperor got up, surprised.\n“L-Lord!”\nIt was Chun Yeowun. The Crown Prince couldn’t understand how it happened. There were eunuchs and guards around the palace, so how could he enter? And Lee Yun was supposed to be in the Sky Demon Order right now.\n“How could Lord come here without a notice….”\n“Your Majesty.”\n“Y-yes?”\nZhu Tae-gyeom looked at him.\nCrown Prince Zhu Chi-yun was angry at the man who came in like this, so he yelled at Chun Yeowun.\n“You bastard! How dare you, a mere Religion Holder of the Empire, show disrespect to the Emperor of—”\nBang!\n“\nKuak!\n”\nBefore he could even finish, the Crown Prince was on his knees. His face was in pain, and his knees seemed like they would explode at any moment.\n‘W-what energy!’\nHe was learning martial arts, so he knew what it meant to suppress one.\nStep!\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun approached him and spoke, looking at the kid with arrogant eyes.\n“Who are you to interrupt the adults’ conversation?”\n“W-what?”\nThe original version of this phrase is “??? ??? ?????.” Aside from the translation above, it can also be translated as\n‘if there’s a will, there’s a way’\nor, as my Korean friend says,\n‘if you want it super f**king bad enough, it will happen.\n’ You are supposed to do something and not just wish blindly to achieve it. For our Young Lord here, what he did to fulfill his wish (his Murim adventure) was to disguise themselves as just a group of people of a small sect and stay at an in. The rest of the events should just unfold as he takes the steps of an adventurer. — ??Angel???",

      "content": "Chapter 237: Side Story (4)\n“Adults?”\nCrown Prince Zhu Chi-yun thought it was absurd. He is the Crown Prince, the one rising in power and the next Emperor. But this man, a mere leader of a cult, was looking down on him.\n“You bastard!!! How dare a mere cult leader with the post of a nation's religion act like this—”\n“Shut up.”\nShh!\nChun Yeowun clenched his finger and placed it on the child’s forehead.\n“You need to be kidding—”\nSnap!\n“\nEuk\n!”\nHe was lightly hit, but he bounced back hard and with a scream. It was as if a chestnut was hit, but the pain was like being hit with a hammer.\nPapak!\nThen someone came.\n“Prince!”\nIt was Namjin, who was known to be the martial arts teacher of the Crown Prince. He moved to the prince in a hurry.\n‘Huh?’\nBut the moment he reached the child, he bounced back along with him.\nBang!\nNamjin, a warrior, was stuck in the throne room wall.\nHe thought that Chun Yeowun just hit them lightly, but he was wrong. Namjin shouted while looking at the prince, who would pass out at any second.\n“How dare you harm the prince of the Empire! This is treason! Take that traitor down!”\n“Treason!!”\nRumble!\nAs soon as the command fell, the eunuchs and the others surrounded Chun Yeowun. At that, the Emperor just touched his forehead.\n‘They are all turning it into a mess.’\nIf it had been in the past, this would have been impossible. But recently, there were changes in the Imperial Palace. Many people had also left the palace, so the new ones didn’t know who Chun Yeowun really was and what he could do.\n“Stop right now….”\nThe Emperor, who was trying to intervene, stopped his words and went silent.\nThinking about it, if he calls them back, they would misunderstand and think that he was afraid of someone below him, and his power would fall.\n‘It cannot be much.’\nIt would be better for them to know about Chun Yeowun through this experience. That is what had to happen. And so the people went to suppress him.\n“Take him down!”\nChun Yeowun, annoyed, flicked his finger.\nTak!\nThen, a shocking thing happened. All the people here grabbed their heads and screamed. Lee Yun was no exception.\n“\nAckkk\n!”\n“M-My head will explode!”\nThud!\nAnd they soon fell to the floor after suffering tremendous pain. The only ones who didn’t were the Head Eunuch, the teacher of the Crown Prince, and the Emperor.\n‘Oh.. my…’\nThey couldn’t speak at what they saw. Around 60 people of the royal guards and eunuchs passed out.\n“…”\nEven the Emperor was surprised. He thought there would be some screaming, but it ended right away.\nThis\nwas incomparable to the Chun Yeowun whom he saw 20 years back.\n“… Ha.”\nThe Emperor sighed. Chun Yeowun was a monster who could overturn the Imperial Family anytime.\n‘What is this?’\nNamjin and the Head Eunuch were shocked. If they knew he was this strong, they wouldn’t have rushed in. As they were confused, Chun Yeowun moved to the throne.\n“P-Protect… His Majesty.”\nNamjin, terrified at what would happen, reached his weapon.\nSwish!\nBang!\n“\nKuak!\n”\n“\nAck!\n”\nHowever, the weapon and the two leaders were slammed into the wall with just a gesture from Chun Yeowun. Leaving them to pass around, he approached the Emperor.\n“Your Majesty.”\nThe chilly voice of Chun Yeowun stiffened his body. The intimidation increased after hearing Chun Yeowun’s voice.\n“L-Lord…”\nIt felt like a fleeting moment, yet he was sweating.\n“I hope you don’t say you are\njust\nZhu Tae-gyeom and\nnot\nthe Emperor. If you do say that, that will be the day the Empire will disappear.”\nSuch arrogance and bold statements. It was too easy for this man to erase an Empire.\n“Don’t forget what you promised during your coronation.”\nAt Chun Yeowun's words, the Emperor gulped. A secret no one but him knows about.\nIt was the non-aggression pact with Chun Yeowun: the oath to never deviate from the Sky Demon Order as the religion.\n“Your answer is late.”\nHe opened his mouth in fear.\n“I-I didn’t forget. Please forgive my rude son. I will fix him.”\n“… I\nbelieve\nyou will.”\nChun Yeowun turned around and went down from there and looked at the Emperor’s face, which aged. The Emperor felt relieved.\n‘… I lived!’\nThen Chun Yeowun pulled out the letter and said,\n“Now, let me tell you about the letter from the Crown Prince.”\nEarly morning at the foot of a lush mountain, a group of people, including Chun Woo-myung, were preparing to go up.\nThe eight rogues were former Murim members and said to be living under false identities for a long time. Chun Woo-myung was happy to meet them, except for one thing.\n“If it wasn’t for the Demonic Cult we wouldn't be suffering like this.”\n“That is what it is.”\nThey were against his cult. Along the way, they constantly complained about it. Thanks to that, Hu Bong and Ko Wang-suk’s expressions weren’t good.\n‘These ones!’\nIt felt like they would beat them down at any second, but since Chun Woo-myung requested, they stayed silent and continued to hide their identity.\n[Be patient, uncle. You can’t kill them.]\nHu Bong wanted to beat them to death several times, but Chun Woo-myung stopped him when he was about to give up controlling his anger.\n“Ah, I am sick of it.”\nKo Wang-suk would drink water each time, and the muscles in her throat would twitch.\n“Really, virtuous man… no. woman.”\nBecause of her, Hu Bong’s mood changed again.\nThe man, Ho Jang-woo, complained about how his clan was destroyed.\n“\nHaa…\nI still cannot forget it. The day the leader got his heart pierced by\nthat\nmonster together with the King of Muscles.”\n“Puh!”\nKo Wang-suk spilled the water she was drinking.\n“…”\nChun Woo-myung, who was walking ahead of her, touched his wet hair.\n“Y-Young Master.”\n“… from now on, walk to the side.”\nHe would have yelled if he didn’t understand it. The King of Muscles was her father, Ko Wanghur.\nThere were more than 30 clans that were destroyed in his hands. And the achievement was for the Sky Demon Order, but those suffering from that hate him.\n‘I don’t feel good.’\nChun Woo-myung wondered if he was wrong in accepting their request. How could he know they hated his cult?\nChun Woo-myung decided to change the topic.\n“But what is it that could have happened in the mountain that you all, too, didn't seem to know? Is there any information at all?”\nAt his question, a man smiled and said.\n“Well. Neither do we know, except that none of those who went in there had returned.”\n“Isn’t it one of the Three Banned Areas?”\nThree Banned Areas.\nPlaces that were told never to enter. Where were they heading now?\n“\nEhh,\nthose are just empty words. If we go during the day we can come out without a problem.”\n“The important thing is that we went in and didn’t find anything.”\n“At night…\nhhm\n. All superstitions.”\n“Why are you acting like the dead come out at night?”\n“\nEhhh\n. Don’t say that!”\nEveryone had looks of concern as they spoke. The place they were heading for was the Mountain of Dead. A place where the dead are known to come out at night.\n[Uncle, is that true?]\nCurious, Chun Woo-myung asked to which Hu Bong snorted.\n[You believe that, Young Lord?]\n[Well? Where in the world could such a place be? I feel good to come out with my uncle in times like this!]\n[\nHehehe,\nright? Thanks to you, I will be going to the Mountain of Dead for the first time.]\n[… Huh…. First… time?]\n[Yes. This is my first time as well. Would I ever come to this side of the Jianghu? Hehe.]\n[Ahhh…. Right.]\nThe credibility and reliability of Hu Bong fell.\nChun Woo-myung, who was looking at Hu Bong, turned his gaze.\n“Is there any reason why you have to put yourselves in that place?”\nOne of the Three Banned Areas, just thinking about it was enough to scare others. Looking at their faces, they too seemed a bit concerned with it. Still, they were volunteering to do it.\n“Well, some high ranking people said they would help rebuild our clan.”\n“Rebuild the clan?”\nHu Bong narrowed his eyes. Currently, the Murim was under the Sky Demon Order. However, listening to them was like they were dreaming of their clan.\n“\nHuhu.\nWho gave that amazing chance?”\nHu Bong asked with a smile. Hon Nae-gae, a member, laughed and said,\n“That is why I said that it was a brilliant chance.”\n“Chance?”\n“I heard from an informant that the Golden Guards have some unusual quest.”\nAt that, Chun Woo-myung was puzzled.\n“Unusual means high reward, right?”\nHe heard the Golden Guards commissioned them. However, he was curious about the fact of it. They were in the middle of their path with no one listening other than themselves, yet they whispered.\n“It is warrior Namjin.”\n“Namjin?”\n“Right! I heard that he is the mentor of the prince who will be the next Emperor. At this point, you can understand, right?”\n“Are you sure?”\nIf this was true, then this quest was from the Crown Prince. Hu Bong’s expression darkened. It was a coincidence at first, but now it doesn't seem so.\n‘Then the Crown Prince and that warrior are trying to help rebuild the clan.’\nIt was a condition that even the current Emperor wouldn’t promise. But these people believed him. They thought that the power of the prince, who would be the Emperor, would rebuild the clan.\n‘Tch. The Lord won’t allow it.’\nHu Bong laughed, looking at the people smiling. Well, he had no intention of telling them.\nHe was going to let it be for the sake of a good experience for his nephew.\nHalf a day since they were moving. It was a clear day, yet it began to turn foggy as they went up. The forest turned dark, making them hold torches.\n“Huh. Strange.”\n“It’s suddenly so foggy.”\nIt was sunny just half an hour ago. However, now that they were almost there, the mountain forest darkened with so much fog.\nThe gloomy mood made their anxiety rise.\n[Strange.]\nChun Woo-myung found it strange. Hu Bong stayed silent.\n[Don’t worry. You have me! Hu Bong is with you!]\nHu Bong made a proud face looking at him. Still, the anxiety didn’t go down. Not long after they walked, the atmosphere felt weird.\n“I-is that a graveyard?”\nThere were abandoned tombs there. Headstones with old wood, which made it scarier.\nEveryone felt uneasy.\n“Ah. What can we find in this?”\nOne by one, they felt skeptical. The sun was about to go down. Yun Ja-seo, their leader, said,\n“We look for an hour and then we retreat. The fog is thick. I don't want to risk it.”\n“Right.”\nEveryone agreed. This place was banned, and there was fog. They didn’t want to overdo it.\n‘I don’t even feel any energy around.’\nChun Woo-myung frowned at it. Just because no people resided in that place didn’t mean no animals were living there, but the area felt empty. For him, it was weird.\nShhh!\n“Master.”\n‘… That was startling!’\nChun Woo-myung looked at the hand which came from behind. It was Ko Wang-suk’s hand, and she had a scared expression on her face.\n“Young Master. This girl is…. scared.”\nClench!\nHis hand was hurting from her grip, her muscles were twitching in fear, and her eyes showed weird selfishness rather than fear.\nChun Woo-myung didn’t say anything but what he was thinking was…\n‘Ko Wang-suk… I am more afraid of you.’\nHe quietly removed her hand and moved ahead and halfway in.\nCkil!\nThey suddenly heard a strange sound.\n“What is that?”\nHe concentrated on that weird sound. Something hazy could be seen beyond the fog. The form looked human but a bit strange since the figure was dragging its feet.\n“What is this smell?”\n“Like rotten corpses?”\nThe others covered their noses.\n‘What is that?’\nChun Woo-myung focused on it and was shocked.\nCrik! Crik!\nA being with rotting flesh was walking toward them by dragging its feet. One of the rogues who saw that shouted.\n“T-the dead!”",

      "content": "Chapter 238: Side Story (5)\nIt was a terrifying sight. A horrifying sight of a corpse walking around.\nCirk! Cirk!\nThe monster looked like a rotten corpse. When one of them shouted as he looked horrified seeing the walking rotten corpse, the others denied it.\n“What shit? What nonsense is that?!”\n“How can that happen?”\nThe human psyche is a unique thing.\n[The one who enters the Mountain of the Dead will never come back alive. It is a place that only the dead can enter.]\nIt is one of the legends of the Three Banned Areas that’s located in the Midwest Region. Everyone present knew about it being\njust\na ‘legend,’ yet all of them were anxious.\nAs they froze, their leader, Yun Ja-seo, stepped forward.\nSrr!\nHe drew his sword and shouted at the approaching monster.\n“Look, I don’t know who you are, but stop!”\nIn response to his warning, the approaching corpse accelerated towards them. Rather than walking, it was now running and screaming.\n“\nKuaaaak!\n”\nThe sight was terrifying. Surprised by the evil-looking monster running in, Yun Ja-seo hurriedly used his sword.\nPupupuk!\n“\nKukukukuku!\n”\nThe stabbed monster was all bloody and staggering, but something more strange happened.\n‘Black blood?’\nChun Woo-myung was puzzled at it. Black blood was coming out of the wounded area. It seemed similar to what happens when the blood gets old and rots.\n“\nUgh.\n”\nHu Bong, who usually had a strong stomach for such things, frowned at the rotten corpse.\nThe rogues approached the fallen monster.\n“What is that?”\n“Is it human?”\nIt seemed like an animal howling.\nChak!\nYun Ja-seo put his sword back in its sheath and looked down. Taking a closer look, it really just looks like a corpse. It looked like the monster died a long time ago. Ho Jong-ii, who made a fuss about\nthe dead\n, said,\n“Isn’t he dead?”\n“Hey. Didn’t you see the\ndead person\ngot stabbed by a sword?”\n“Enough, Ho-jeong.”\nThe rogues turned anxious. Perhaps, because of his bravery, the nerdy-looking Hon No-gae sneaked close to the corpse and used one hand to hold his nose while the other had a branch touching the corpse.\n“What are you doing?”\n“Looking. Like this black blood, maybe it is a plague.”\n“P-plague!”\nAt the word plague, everyone closed their noses and mouths simultaneously. It was a reasonable guess. Once upon a time, a small village in the mountains was hit with a weird plague, so the entire place was isolated.\n“Does one turn into an animal when they get plague?”\nKo Wang-suk asked Hu Bong with a puzzled expression. How could Hu Bong even know of it?\n“Well. It’s my first time coming across something….”\nIt was then.\n“\nKuaaaaak!\n”\nCrack!\n“\nAccckkk!\n”\nThe corpse-looking monster, which had collapsed, abruptly got up and bit the ankle of Hon No-gae.\nShocked, he tried to kick the monster away using his other foot.\nPuck!\nThe monster bounced back.\n“\nKuak!\n”\nSrrrng!\nAll of them drew their weapons at the same time. It was very shocking for them that the corpse-looking monster was alive.\n“H-How can that be?”\n“I touched and sealed more than a dozen blood points, how is it still alive?”\nYun Ja-seo did seal the blood points. Moving like that shouldn’t be possible after getting stabbed, but the monster moved unbothered.\nCrik! Crik!\n“Damn it!”\nHon No-gae grabbed his left ankle that was bitten earlier. The flesh was torn off. One of the rogues supported him to balance.\n“Can you walk?”\n“\nKuak\n. It looks like you broke a tendon.”\nIt was difficult for the man to now use light footwork.\n“\nKuaaak!\n”\nThe monster, not caring about anything, jumped and ran to them again.\nAt that moment, they were all puzzled at the monster that doesn’t die even after getting stabbed, kicked, or sealed.\nChak!\nAfter one swing of his sword, the head of the monster running toward them rolled on the floor. Then Hu Bong stood behind with a sword in his hand.\n“Let’s see if it still survives even without its head.”\n“\nAhh…\n”\nThe rogues calmed and looked at the monster, which had its head cut off, and thought if this was better than stabbing it a hundred times.\n‘There was no hesitation in his hand.’\nSome of them frowned at how effortlessly Hu Bong’s sword moved. In rare cases, most clans wouldn’t aim for the neck of the opponent. Even though they use martial arts, they don’t aim for the throat.\n‘They can’t be from the Forces of Justice.’\nAnd such thoughts formed in their mind. On the other hand, Chun Woo-myung and Ko Wang-suk, who received harsh education since childhood, had thought of cutting the head and wondered if this monster would still move.\nBut another weird thing happened.\n“Huh?”\nThe headless body was trying to attack Hu Bong.\nHu Bong, too, was shocked at this strange thing that he had never witnessed before and avoided the monster.\nTatatak!\n“What is this?”\nHe tried to dodge, but the no-head corpse-looking monster kept running toward him.\n“\nEik!\n”\nThe rogues were gasping. First, they thought it was a plague, but now they were confused. The decapitated body was moving in front of them. It was strange. Very strange.\n“\nKakakakaka!\n”\nAnother surprising thing was that the severed head was constantly screaming.\n“D-Dead!”\n“T-the dead!”\nRight. This monster was indeed a dead person. Otherwise, this wouldn’t be possible.\n“Uncle Hu! Legs. Aim for the legs!”\nChun Woo-myung shouted.\n“Okay!”\nChak!\nHu Bong avoided the incoming monster and cut off the legs. And when the legs were cut, the body fell down. However, since the body had no legs, it tried to use its hands to catch Hu Bong.\nIt was such a terrifying sight.\n“\nKuak!\n”\nThis time, Hu Bong was shocked and finally revealed his strength.\nWheik!\nFlames soared on his sword, and Hu Bong, who had the blood of Qilin, was holding it.\n“F-Flame on sword?”\nThe rogue's eyes widened.\nAmong the Murim, only a few could handle the Flame Qi.\n‘No!’\nThey were surprised.\nWheik!\nWhen Hu Bong swung his flame sword, the body crawling toward him was caught on fire, and one usually dies after receiving that kind of attack. Yet, despite being cut in half and burned, the body still moved.\nThud!\n‘What the hell is this?’\nEveryone was speechless at that sight.\nA loud noise could be heard from the dark underground place.\nBang! Bang!\nSomething was wanting to get out. The person looking into the iron bars with curious eyes was Chun Yeowun.\n“Interesting.”\nThe reason why Chun Yeowun said that was because only the head, torso, and left arm were trapped inside the iron bars. All the other parts were cut off, but the body was alive.\n‘This is interesting?’\nThe Emperor next to him frowned. It was a frightening sight for anyone.\nThe being inside this prison was a corpse, yet it was moving.\n“Where did you find this?”\n“… a valley near the Mountain of Dead.”\nIt was the Crown Prince who answered very carefully.\n“Mountain of Dead? One of the Three Banned Areas.”\nChun Yeowun heard of it. It was the only banned area that Chun Yeowun hadn’t visited.\n“You found something interesting.”\nTo his reaction, the Crown Prince spoke in a stern voice.\n“Don’t take it so lightly.”\n“What would that mean?”\n“No matter how many times it is cut, put in water or burnt, it will move.”\n“Oh.”\nWhich meant it was immortal. However, it couldn’t regenerate. Which was why Chun Yeowun didn’t take it seriously.\n“I don’t think you had to call for the help of the cult for this. It seems like something that your Golden Guards or the East Spears could handle for the Emperor.”\nThe Emperor replied,\n“That isn’t it.”\n“… what do you mean?”\n“As you said, if it could be handled with them, we wouldn’t have sent a letter requesting for your help.”\nChun Yeowun didn’t understand it.\n“Even if it can’t die, you can make it immobile and lock it up, what is the problem?”\nAt Chun Yeowun’s question, the Crown Prince Zhu Chi-yun spoke.\n“Then we wouldn’t have asked for help if it’s just that. The problem is that… that monsters are infectious.”\n“Infectious.”\nChun Yeowun looked at the monster with serious eyes.\nCrack!\n“\nAck!\nH-Hon No-gae, what are you doing?!”\nThe man supporting him panicked and pushed him away.\n“\nKuak!\n”\nHe looked at his shoulder. As he was supporting, the flesh was bitten off. Hon No-gae began to bite his shoulder.\n“What crazy shit… huh?”\nThe eyes of the angry man went wide.\n“\nKuaaak…\n”\nHon No-gae’s eyes were both dazed, his skin turned gray like a corpse, and black veins appeared, transforming into something horrible.\nCrack!\nAnd he was biting on the flesh he nit from his comrade earlier and gulped. It was a frightening sight to see.\n“Hon No-gae!”\nThe others, too, noticed he was acting strange and pulled far. It was like seeing a monster. He was slowly acting like the monster which moved even after being burned.\n“Collect yourself!”\nOne of them shook him, but the Hon No-gae they knew was no longer there.\n“\nKuaaak!\n”\nA monster-like sound came from his mouth that they couldn’t understand.\n“W-what does this mean?”\n“\nKuaaaak!\n”\nHon No-gae, who turned into a monster, rushed to the man he bit. Flustered, the man moved.\nPhat!\n“R-run away!”\nThey would rather fight against alive people than the dead who would rush to them repeatedly.\n“Everyone, withdraw!”\nYun Ja-seo, the leader of the rogues, shouted. Everyone moved aside because they didn’t want to stay there any longer.\nPapapah!\n“Young Master?”\nAt Hu Bong’s question, Chun Woo-myung nodded his head. Since he didn’t know what this monster was, it was right to step back.\n“\nKyaak!\n”\nThe scream of Ko Wang-suk was heard.\n“Ko Wang-suk!”\nChun Woo-myung looked at her.\nHe was surprised to see Hon No-gae, who turned, holding one of her thick hands in his while she was trying to make him move.\n‘!?’\n“\nKwaak!\n”\nThe mouth opened wide, ready to bite her.\n“\nAccck!\n”\nCrack!\nAt that moment, she put energy into her hand, crushed the monster's head, and punched the chest.\nPuck!\n“\nKuak!\n”\nBaaang!\nThe body felt as if it had been thrown back. Ko Wang-suk, who sent the monster away, burst into tears and ran to Chun Woo-myung, wiping out the brains and blood on her.\n“Young Master, I am scared!”\nSeeing her approaching, he only thought.\n‘… I am more scared.’\nBut he couldn’t say that. Meanwhile, the body with the head burst got up, and ran again.\n“Young Master. We need to leave now.”\nThey decided to move as Hu Bong urged them.\n“Yes, uncle. Let’s move away for now.”\nPhat!\nChun Woo-myung agreed to it and flew to the other side of the forest. And dreamed of his first-ever adventure, which turned into a horror story.\nWell, this wasn’t a banned area for nothing.\n‘Was that really dead?’\nEverything that happened earlier made no sense. However, Chun Woo-myung, who was walking back, caught something.\n‘Huh?’\nWhat could be seen through the fog were the rogues who ran away. He could see them taking a step back.\n‘What’s with them?’\nPuzzled, he got closer to them to see clearly, but then understood why they were stepping back.\n‘!!!’\nNumerous figures were visible through the thick fog. All were the same kind of monsters.\nAngel’s Corner\nLMAO, hahahaha, I never expected the side-story to be a horror story. ??????",

      "content": "Chapter 239: Side Story (6)\nChak!\n“W-wait, what are you doing?”\nThe Emperor was shocked at Chun Yeowun’s actions, who cut the iron bars and entered. He couldn’t understand why he was doing it.\nClank!\n“Kuaaak!”\nThe monster corpse only had one arm, the left arm, and it was tied. The body was rotting and disgusting.\nChun Yeowun approached it.\n“Be careful. If you are bitten or scratched by it—”\nCrack!\n“Kuaaak!”\nBefore the Emperor could warn, half of the monster’s body was instantly buried on the floor. The rotten corpse made strange sounds which were probably because of pain.\n‘Haa…’\nThe Emperor bit his tongue. He knew that Chun Yeowun was a\nmonster\nand was called the Demon God, but he kept getting shocked. On the other hand, the Crown Prince looked at Chun Yeowun weirdly.\n‘Hmm.’\nChun Yeowun touched the blood of the monster with his hand. It was to find out what state it was. He closed his eyes as he was inspecting it. He seemed like a doctor looking for something and found it strange.\n‘Strange.’\nThe monster was neither alive nor dead; rather, it was in a subtle state. It was like both life and death existed at the same time. Typically, it shouldn’t be like that.\n‘Nano?’\n[ It is difficult to determine the truth from a biological point of view. The dead cells are moving. ]\nIt was the same when even Nano scanned. This was something more than artificial control.\nBut it was strange.\n‘This energy… seems very similar to.’\nThe energy from the monster was something Chun Yeowun was familiar with.\n“Did you say it was picked up in the ruins?”\nThe Crown Prince answered.\n“… yes.”\n“Hmm.”\nChun Yeowun stroked his chin. He couldn’t get much. It seemed like he had to ask\nher\ndirectly.\nChun Yeowun said, grabbing the neck of the monster on the floor,\n“Let me take this one.”\n“W-what?”\nShhh!\nAs soon as the Emperor questioned, Chun Yeowun and the rotten corpse were sucked into space.\nThe Emperor was flustered.\n“Huh.”\nThe Crown Prince looked at the empty cell and spoke to the Emperor with a strange smile.\n“Now that he has stepped forward, there\nwill\nbe good news. Especially to our Imperial family.”\nThat smile was more evil than kind.\nThe place is full of fog. There were sounds of flesh being cut off.\nChak!\nThere were also sounds from the crushing mouths of the people. Facing the worst situation, they struggled to overcome the fog, which didn’t let them see, and the monsters that kept chasing them. They were the prey.\n“\nKuak\n!”\n“Back away!”\nYun Ja-seo cut off the legs of a monster. Since they don’t die, parts were cut to hinder movements.\n‘Don’t be bitten.’\nHe saw two of his men turning into monsters. It wasn’t known what it was, but he could become like them if he’s bitten. It was necessary to avoid being bitten.\n“\nAhhh!\n”\n“Shit!”\nBut that wasn’t easy. Another one of his men was bitten by the monster of his ankle. It was tough to deal with the rotten corpses that felt no pain and kept coming after them.\nClench!\n“Nooooooo!”\nAnother had his wrist bitten.\n“Damn it!”\nSurprised, the man beside him found it and made a grievous expression as he cut the head off.\nChak!\nHe couldn’t help but watch his comrades turn into monsters. Maybe the others also understood it, so they dealt with them without another word.\nChachachacha!\nChun Woo-myung and the others, too, were going through the same. The monsters kept coming at them.\n“Uncle Hu, we cannot keep doing this. There is no end.”\nChak!\nHu Bong cut one of its legs and kicked the body to answer.\n“\nEuk!\nI have the same thought, Young Master.”\nThey were incredibly pressured not to be bitten by the rotten corpses that don’t die. No matter how strong they were, they couldn’t deal with it.\nEven when they're put on fire, they still run!\nHu Bong made a wall of flames, but they still would come through it.\n“They don’t turn to ashes?”\n“It’s not difficult, but I will run out of Flame Qi before I can gather again.”\nBurning a body needs a high level of qi, which meant he could run out until his body generated it again. And where there were endless enemies, this made no sense.\n‘What do we do?’\nChun Woo-myung looked around.\nPeople were getting tired because of the monsters, and they might get bitten at this rate. While looking around, he heard a woman’s scream.\n“\nKyaak\n! Don’t come here!”\nIt was Ko Wang-suk.\nShe grabbed the rotten corpse’s head, crushed it, and threw the body away at the others.\nThud!\nThe monsters fell because of the force. Here she was the only one dealing with the rotten corpses with bare hands and was taking them down faster than Hu Bong!\n“\nKyaak!\nDon’t come!”\nPak!\nKo Wang-suk grabbed the leg of the monster and swung it like a club.\nPuk!\n“\nKuak\n!”\n“\nAck\n!”\nThe monster was now her weapon and hit the other monsters. It was as if a giant was beating her enemies.\n“Don’t come! You bastards!”\nPak!\n“\nKuak!\n”\nContrary to the beginning, her voice was turning harsher.\nShe was like a tyrant.\nChun Woo-myung had a chill run down.\n‘Who would live with her?’\nThe thought made him terrified, yet he saw how great she was at handling the monsters. It wasn’t something that could be done with only strong internal energy.\n‘Ah!’\nChun Woo-myung came up with a good thought.\n“Uncle Hu! Wang-suk!”\n“Uh?”\n“Young Master?”\nThen he spoke about his plan to both of them. After hearing the plan, Hu Bong nodded while Wang-suk asked in shock.\n“M-me?”\nTo her, Chun Woo-myung said,\n“Yes. You are the only one I have.”\nAt the words of Chun Woo-myung, her face turned red. She rubbed her cheeks and nodded.\nFire!\nAnd then, as if ready, her body began to heat up! A girl in love with the force of a fiery pit.\n“You are handling her well, Young Master.”\nHu Bong praised Chun Woo-myung.\nChun Woo-myung bit his lip.\n“We need to live first.”\nCould he lose his life on his first trip outside?\nOn the other hand, only three of the eight rogues were left, and they looked at the monsters with tired faces. And among the monsters, two were their companions.1\n“\nKuak\n, how did it end up like...”\n“That is why I said to not set foot in here!”\nThey regretted coming here, and Yun Ja-seo couldn’t say anything to them. It was for their dream to rebuild the clan, but that dream also collapsed.\n‘Ahhh…’\nIt was then.\n“Follow us!”\nThey heard a shout.\nWheik!\nBoom!\n“\nKuak!\n”\n“\nKuak!\n”\nFire came with the screams of the rotten corpses. They saw two gigantic flaming clubs falling on the monsters.\n‘T-that!’\nIt was like a gigantic being showing a miracle—an eye-opening sight.\nAnd they were able to pierce through the path that was made.\n“What is this?”\nThe rogue was flustered. That gigantic being was Hu Bong on Ko Wang-suk’s shoulders.\nHu Bong, on her, was using fire onto the clubs which Ko Wang-suk was wielding.\n“Come on!\nHehe\n!”\nHu Bong shouted in excitement.\n‘S-so embarrassing!’\nKo Wang-suk was red as a beet at what they were doing. At first, it seemed like a simple plan, but she was dealing with enemies, and Hu Bong would use the flame from above her shoulders to cut off the monster's movements for a second. The one in charge of the rear was Chun Woo-myung.\n“Hurry!”\nAt the shout, the puzzled men rushed to him.\nThey thought they were going to die, but now a path came in front of them.\nWheik! Bang!\n“\nKuk!\n”\n“\nAck!\n”\nA number of monsters were being thrown out. Getting used to it, she too moved a lot more ferociously than before. And the ones behind her admired it. Before long, the monsters had lessened.\n“W-with this way, we can leave the mountain!”\n“We will live!”\nThey all cheered, but they saw a black shadow in the forest as they moved. Hu Bong frowned at it. This being looked like a shadow of a person holding a sword.\n‘A person?’\nHe looked closer, but it had a half-rotten face like the monsters they faced.\n“Is this the last one?!”\nKo Wang-suk held the flaming club.\nChak!\nThe body of the blazing creature she was holding as a club was split before she could move. It didn’t end there. The sword, which cut the weapon she was holding, aimed for her neck.\n“Huh!”\nHu Bong quickly used his sword and blocked it.\nChang!\n“Uh?”\nThe moment the sword and blade collided…\nBang!\nHu Bong and Ko Wang-suk were thrown back simultaneously, and thanks to that, those who followed them also fell.\n“\nAck!\n”\nEveryone was on the ground in pain and barely got up.\nHu Bong mumbled.\n“Young Master, that monster….”\n“… is using martial arts.”\nDespite seeing it, Chun Woo-myung couldn’t believe it. Using martial arts wasn’t the problem here. The problem was Hu Bong, who was known to be one of the best, and Ko Wang-suk were thrown easily at the same time.\n“This is quite a horrible time.”\nChak!\nChun Woo-myung raised his sword and took the stance of the Sword Force of the Sky Demon. He had to deal with his monster and get out of this place. The monster's expression contorted as it looked at the movement of Chun Woo-myung.\n‘Why is it doing that?’\nIt seemed like the monster was angry, and as he was puzzled by it, the monster yelled.\n“Grrrrr… Sword Force… of… Sky Demon!”\n‘!?’\nI guess they killed three of their companions before becoming monsters/zombies.?",

      "content": "Chapter 240: Side Story (7)\nChun Woo-myung’s eyelids flickered. It was surprising that the rotten corpse spoke, but it was more surprising that he recognized his sword technique.\n‘What is it?’\nHe wasn’t alive. His skin was rotting, and his eyes were dazed like the others.\nThe monster shouted.\n“D…De… Demon Godddd!”\n“Demon God?”\nPhat!\nThere was no time to talk; the monster went straight for Chun Woo-myung.\n“Shit!”\nHu Bong managed to move forward.\nWheik!\nHu Bong used his Sword and Flame Qi simultaneously, and the monster was engulfed in flames.\n‘Amazing.’\nYun Ja-seo, who was watching, admired it. How many people in the world could wield their sword so greatly?\n‘As expected of the Flame Emperor!’\nThat was Hu Bong’s title.\nYun Ja-seo had identified him. There weren’t many people who could use Flame Qi and Illusion Sword technique in Murim. As a result, he was surprised, yet he wasn’t relieved. This was because the Sky Demon Order was their enemy.\nChachacha!\nAt that time, the monster looked at the trajectory of the flames. His blade cut the trajectory of the flames by drawing a line with subversive momentum.\n‘Huh?’\nAs a result, Hu Bong's eyes widened as the monster spread the technique. It was the same with Chun Woo-myung.\n‘This blade technique?’\nSurprisingly, the blade technique that monster was unleashing was something they knew all too well. It had disappeared into history now, but even 20 years ago, it was called the strongest blade technique.\nPhat!\nHu Bong avoided the sharp blade flying through the gaps in his technique by spreading his footwork. But the monster continued to unleash his form at Hu Bong.\n‘Damn it!’\nHu Bong was experienced, but the monster's blade technique was so exquisitely aimed at the neck. At that moment, a sharp sword pierced into the monster's side.\nChasl!\nWith that, he changed the direction of the blade to block it.\n“Demon… God!”\nThe monster's expression contorted with anger.\nIt was none other than Chun Woo-myung who spread the sword towards him. He intervened to save Hu Bong.\n“What are you? Why are you saying my father’s name….”\nShh!\nBefore Chun Woo-myung could even finish his words, the monster's blade came for his head.\nBang!\nBut then the floor sank, and both missed their balance.\n“You need to be careful, Young Master!”\nIt was Ko Wang-suk who made the floor sink. If she were a little late, Chun Woo-myung would have been beheaded.\n“Mouse like… things… always… around!”\nPak!\nFurious, the monster slammed the blade to the ground. Sharp eight-pointed energy rose from the bottom and aimed for Chun Woo-myung.\nHu Bong and Ko Wang-suk shouted at the same time.\n“That is!”\nThey knew this well.\nIt was of the Blade God Six Martial clan’s 7th formation, the Eightfold Blade. Knowing this meant knowing the gap.\nPhat!\nThe three of them moved back at the same time. However, the changes in the energy points were so fast that they couldn’t avoid altogether.\nChachang!\nHu Bong and Chun Woo-myung responded with swords simultaneously, and Ko Wang-suk used her hand with internal energy.\nChachahca!\n‘What sharp control!’\nDespite knowing what was being done, they couldn’t help but feel inferior to it. One of the rogues watching them said,\n“Leader. Let’s run away.”\n“Run?”\n“Well, they are the Demonic Cult members. If they die fighting that one, we have nothing to lose. Let’s run now.”\nWhat was said was true, but Yun Ja-seo frowned.\nWasn’t it nice for the cult that they hate to lose people? Besides, this monster was too strong.\n‘There is no hope.’\nInstead, they might be dragged into danger if they stated they couldn’t help.\n“Please! Leader!”\nAt their words, Yun Ja-seo hesitated.\n‘We need to go….’\nHowever, he couldn’t move. Despite what happened, these people helped them till here. And they were definitely companions for a short while.\n“Leader!”\nAnother yelled.\n“You people run.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“I am Yun Ja-seo! Although my clan is closed, at least the teachings of the clan haven’t been erased from my heart!”\n“N-No way!”\n“I have received grace so I will repay it!”\nPhat!\nWith that, Yun Ja-seo desperately moved, trying to use the sword of the Qingcheng sect.\n“Brother Chun! Brother Hu! I will help!”\nChachachak!\nHe aimed at the back of the monster, which was focusing on the three people simultaneously. And since he was looking from afar, he knew how to move. No matter how strong the monster was, he couldn’t defend himself when battling three people.\nHowever…\nBang! Papapak!\n“\nKuak!\n”\nAs the monster took a step, the rocks flew up, blocked the sword, and struck him on the chest.\n“\nKuak!\n”\nBlood gushed from his mouth!\n“Brother Yun!”\nChun Woo-myung, who was dealing with the monster, shouted. To which he smiled.\n‘Foolish bastard. How can he be that kind?’\nAfter all that had happened, the child still looked for him. At least, he felt like he didn’t deviate from the clan’s teaching, and that felt fine to Yun Ja-seo.\nPak!\n‘!?’\nBut someone suddenly came and supported him.\nAnd a shadow appeared in front and spread a sword which stopped the stones.\nChachacha!\n“\nKuak!\n”\nSince the level was low, the stones pierced, and the three fell down. Yun Ja-seo was shocked at the faces he saw.\n“You people!”\nThey were the ones who wanted to run. Holding the aching stomach, one of them said,\n“\nUgh\n… Leader… you were turning us into cowards.”\nYun Ja-seo said in a trembling voice.\n“You have to rebuild the clan….”\n“I don’t know about that, and like the leader said, those Demonic Cult ones seemed like nice people. So let’s do this together.”\nNangin, who’s one of them, reached for Yun Ja-seo.\n“Let’s help….”\nHe took his hand and stood up.\n“It’s them!!”\nThe three were ready to run when Chun Woo-myung shouted.\n“Don’t come!”\nWith their level, handling the monster would be tough. Chun Woo-myung was able to deal with the monster because they knew about the monster's techniques.\n“We cannot do that. We will all live!”\nIf they hadn’t helped, the rogues would have run, but not anymore, which moved Chun Woo-myung.\nEven if their relationship started off weirdly, they all felt righteous for some reason.\n‘They will die.’\nAnd Chun Woo-myung didn’t want that to happen. So he decided to do his best.\nThe Unification of Energy induced into the Sword Force of the Sky Demon.\n‘Too tough!’\nCrack!\nAll the energies were gathered, which made the wind rise around, and all concentrated on the tip of Chun Woo-myung’s sword.\n‘The Young Lord is trying to win! Then!’\nHu Bong, who understood it, began to use the Illusion Sword technique and Ko Wang-suk, too, did the same.\nThe three used the best of theirs at the same time.\nIt was then.\n“Ki…ds…!”\nSomething hazy appeared in the hand of the monsters. It wasn’t sword energy, but…\n“Invisible Blade!”\nSomething which could only be achieved by those at the Divine Master level. The Blade God Six Martial clan technique would now unfold more strongly.\nPapapa!\nSix people were thrown out at once.\n“\nKuak!\n”\n“\nAck!\n”\nTwo rogues were torn into a pile of meat, and Yun Ja-seo couldn’t be much greater. He, too, tried to block it, but his right arm was cut off while trying.\n“\nKuck!\n”\nChun Woo-myung coughed blood and looked at Hu Bong and Ko Wang suk. Ko Wang-suk looked terrible, but Hu Bong took most of the attack, trying to protect them.\n“Uncle Hu!”\n“Young Lord… cough….”\nThud!\nHu Bong was on his knee. Fortunately, he had regenerative power, so he didn’t lose his life.\n‘My arms don’t have the strength anymore….’\nKo Wang-suk had blocked it with her arms. She used energy on it to protect her body. However, she knew that she couldn’t move like that again.\n‘If only I wasn’t stubborn….’\nChun Woo-myung regretted it. If only he wasn’t after the thoughts of some adventure.\nStep!\nThe monster walked towards them. Looking at it, he knew that there was no hope.\nThen the monster said,\n“You… are.. not… Demon… God… kid…”\nIt seemed like the monster knew he wasn’t\nthe\nDemon God, and Chun Woo-myung shouted,\n“Who are you? How do you know that technique?”\nFrom what he knew, that clan was already annihilated, and whoever was alive was in hiding. Everyone from that clan who survived hated his father. Then who is this one?\nThe monster answered him.\n“I… am… the… Blade… Lord… of the….”\n“What?”\nHU Bong was shocked.\n‘… no way.’\nThe Blade Lord represents the clan, and he already died at Chun Yeowun’s hands. There was no way that man could have survived.\n“No. You are the Blade Lord?”\nAt Hu Bong’s words, the monster smiled weirdly.\n“I left… and… came… back… from….”\n‘Back from the dead?’\nShh!\nWhether they were shocked or not, the monster declared itself as the Blade Lord and lifted the Invisible Blade, ready to take them down.\n“Stop. Blade Lord.”\nA voice from somewhere was heard, and the blade that was about to strike stopped.\nStep! Step!\nAt that moment, a black figure moved into the misty forest, and it was a middle-aged man giving out some weird cold energy.\n‘Tremendous.’\nClench!\nHu Bong clenched his hand, ready to jump in. With this power alone, this man had surpassed the Blade Lord. He couldn’t understand why the man wasn’t famous in the Murim.\n“Why… am… i… asked… to… stop?”\nThe white-haired man smiled.\n“These are sacrifices to draw out the Demon God.”\n“What?!”\nAt that, both Hu Bong and Chun Woo-myung stood up in anger. They said they were going to be sacrificed to bring out Demon God.\n“Idiots.”\nShh!\nThe middle-aged man held out his hand, and the chill spread around, making their bodies freeze.\nJjkkk!\n“Huh?”\n“Ice Qi?”\nTheir bodies were trapped in it.\n“Do you think you have locked me up like this?!”\nWhei…\nHu bong tried to melt it, but no matter how much he tried, he couldn’t move and almost exhausted his Qi.\n“No.”\nHu Bong was shocked when the white-haired man said,\n“If you have any intention to stay alive, stay till. Hu Bong, Demon God’s first subordinate.”\nThe man knew who Hu Bong was, which made him more furious.\n“How dare you bastard!”\n“How long will you be this great in the jaws of a tiger?”\n“What?”\nThud!\nThen, the ground shook.\nThud!\nHowever, it wasn’t an earthquake.\nThud…\n‘T-this…’\nThere was something huge that was making the entire place resonate. Eerie energy shook.\nCreepy!\nThe atmosphere was enough to make them feel fear. All three of them were shocked when something huge came from the fog.\n‘Mon…ster!’\nAt the palace of the Crown Prince in the Imperial Palace…\nBang!\nThe table was broken into two, and the one who did it was the Crown Prince.\nHe had an irritated face, different from what he had in front of the Emperor.\nHe spoke to the man in an official robe in front of the table.\n“Didn’t I suffer shame after doing what you said?”\n“I apologize.”\nThe officer with him dropped his gaze and apologized. The prince’s anger was still there, so he grabbed the man by the collar.\n“Can we really deal with the damned cult if we do this?”\n“\nHuhu.\nIt will be done.”\nThe man comforted him and pulled something from his sleeve. It was a scroll.\n“You need to listen to it clearly. Now, could you let me go?”\n“\nHuh!\n”\nThe Crown Prince let go of the collar, and the man smiled as he opened the scroll.\nInside the scroll was some bizarre entity, which made the Crown Prince ask in disgust.\n“What is that?”\n“Do you know of the old legends?”\nThe Crown Prince asked,\n“That book with legends written in it?”\n“Well, you might see it that way. However, didn’t the Crown Prince look at the Ghoul with his own eyes?”\nGhoul.\nIt meant a dead body.\n“Are you talking about that ugly thing?”\n“Yes.”\n“Where did you get such a thing?”\nThe Crown Prince was curious about it. He wondered how this person got a dead being.\n“Crown Prince, various beings were talked about in those records. Do you know which of them is the most?”\n“… how will I know of it?”\n“\nHuhuhu\n. My noble Crown Prince.”\n“Are you disrespecting this Crown Prince?”\n“Why would I ever? There are three great yokai which are known to have existed for a long time. And are called the Three Yokai.”\n“Three?”\nThree Yokai. It refers to the evilest beings in the world. And the term yokai wasn’t coined for nothing. The Crown Prince took the scroll and said,\n“… is this that?”\n“\nHuhu.\nRight. Precisely. It’s one of the three.”\n“One of the three?”\nAnd the man said,\n“Not some mere existence. This being in here is the king of the dead that the dead worships too! A giant monster which is said to be the beginning of end!”\n“King of… dead!”\nJust the title sent a shiver down his spine. The Crown Prince then asked.\n“What… what after it?”\n“The leader of…. No, Demon God Chun Yeowun is a human who has crossed normal realm.”\n“\nHuh!\n”\nRight, he witnessed that, so he didn’t deny it. With the power Chun Yeowun showed, no wonder the Murim was unified under him, and he was recognized as the strongest by everyone.\nThe man continued to speak.\n“But this being is on another level.”\n“What do you mean? This one is going to take care of that man?”\nDespite pretending to be bold, the Crown Prince who saw the Demon God couldn’t feel that this monster would take him down. However, it didn’t matter now.\nAs a result, it didn’t matter if the giant monster was good or bad; he just wanted that man dead.\nThe man smiled.\n“Well, the King of the Dead can easily kill the Demon God.”\n“Easily kill?”\n“He is a giant monster known to be the strongest of the Three Yokai. How can a human, called Demon God, handle it? What we…”\n“Interesting.”\n‘!?’\nAt the unfamiliar voice, the man stopped talking. It was made sure that everyone had moved away from the Crown Prince’s room. So even the Crown Prince went stiff.\n“Crown… Prince?”\nHe was looking at the man with a fearful expression. And the man turned his head. Behind him was a man with a black robe and a dragon pattern on it.\n“\nUgh!\n”\nSurprised by that, he tried to move and attack. But nothing happened as the moment his fist touched, it broke.\nCrack!\n“\nKuaak!\n”\nThe man groaned with an aching hand. The Golden Gumiho with nine tails looked at the scroll that was on the floor.\n“Strongest of the three? Since when did he turn as the strongest? Such a joke.”\nThe golden fox moved around. The Golden Gumiho looked down and smiled.\n“Demon… God…”\nIt was Chun Yeowun. The Crown Prince couldn’t shut his mouth, which was opened due to the shock.",

      "content": "Chapter 241: Side Story (8)\n‘W-when did he come in?’\nCrown Prince Zhu Chi-yun couldn’t hide his shock at the sight of Chun Yeowun in front of him.\nAt some point, this man suddenly appeared, and that was absurd. But that wasn’t the real problem.\n‘He heard all that we talked about?’\nThe discussion was about Chun Yeowun and their plan to kill him. If he heard all that, then this was the worst-case scenario.\nWhat was interesting was the fox talking to him, but he couldn’t recognize it.\nChun Yeowun then spoke.\n“Zhu Chi-yun.”\n“A-ah. You, how could you come into the Crown Prince…\nhuk\n!”\nBefore he could even finish speaking, his body floated regardless of his will. His body was being moved.\n‘What internal energy is this!’\nHe had been through it before, yet, it was still shocking. Trying to hold how flustered he was, he shouted.\n“W-what is this? Let me down! Now!”\nThere was just one thing he could do. It was to yell. But the problem was…\n‘It feels weird….’\nThe escorts and guards had to be close by. Yet, someone freely entered the room without anyone noticing. This made him think.\n‘Who can stop him from coming?’\nEven if they wanted to, Chun Yeowun had the power to control the entire central plains.\n“This is fun. What was that again?\nTake care\nof me?”\nChun Yeowun spoke to the Crown Prince, whose face was now ashen. He was hoping that Chun Yeowun heard nothing, but he was definitely wrong.\n“I-I am the Crown Prince of the Empire. Even if you hold the Religion of the Nation, the slightest threat to the—”\nCrack!\n“\nAccck!\n”\nThe Crown Prince had his right arm broken to the extent that his broken bones were seen, yet Chun Yeowun’s expression didn’t change. It was utter cruelty.\n“What of it?”\n“\nKuaaak.\n. you, you bastard! Do you think you can escape from this? If you touch the Crown Prince, the entire clan of yours will be annihilated!”\nCrack!\nHis left arm was broken this time, and the Crown Prince screamed in pain again.\n“\nAccck!\n”\nHaving both arms broken, Zhu Chi-yun screamed in tears. This was a first for him.\nBeing born a noble, no one could say anything to him, and no one had the power to do that.\n“\nKuaaaal!\n”\nThe pain he felt for the first time caused anger too. This was the first time he hated someone like this. But he wasn’t strong.\n“Cute.”\n“What?!”\nChun Yeowun smiled while bending the Crown Prince’s legs.\nCrack!\n“\nAccck!\n”\nThe broken bones stuck out. It was hard to imagine the limbs being broken while floating up.\n“\nKuak!\n”\nZhu Chi-yun’s mind was complicated. Anger was something, but this man in front of him had no ounce of consideration for him.\nHe didn’t think of him as a prince.\n‘Kuk… that bastard….’\nHe was going crazy. He wanted to call everyone and ensure that the Sky Demon Order was destroyed, but he couldn’t do anything.\nChun Yeowun grabbed him by the chin.\nTak!\n“W… what are you?”\nHe didn’t know what this man would do, and he was already angry.\n“Let’s see if you can make those eyes even if your chin is pulled out.”\n‘Chin?’\nZhu Chi-yun was terrified at this.\n“I-I am Crown Prince! You will be….”\n“Crown Prince?”\n“…. yes!”\n“You have a lot of pride. Then, as of today you aren’t the Crown Prince.”\n“What?”\nZhu Chi-yun widened his eyes. What was this man talking about changing the Crown Prince?\nClench!\n“Up!”\nChun Yeowun closed his mouth and smiled, looking at him.\n“It seems like your father, Zhu Tae-gyeom, said nothing because of his pride. He should have said that this Empire will be erased in any second I want it to.”\n‘!?’\nAt those words, the Crown Prince’s eyes shook. It was because this didn’t sound like a bluff.\n‘Erase… the Empire?’\nWhile he was still in a state of shock, someone shouted.\n“Demon God! If you don’t release the Crown Prince right now, you will regret it!”\nIt was the man with the broken arm. He was still in pain, but he yelled at Chun Yeowun while holding a dagger.\nTak!\nThe Golden Gumiho who was on Chun Yeowun’s shoulder asked,\n— You think that will work?\nThe man's eyes widened.\n“W-what is tha….”\nBang!\n“\nKuak!\n”\nBefore he could say anything, his body crashed into the ceiling, and the dagger in his hand turned to ashes.\nPsss!\nAs the dagger vanished, the man couldn’t shut his mouth.\nChun Yeowun blinked.\nShhh!\nThe robes were torn off, and beneath them were muscles. Chun Yeowun smiled.\n“I thought so. Blade God Six Martial Clan, right?”\n‘\n!!!’\nHearing that, the man’s face went stiff. It was because those words were true.\n‘Damn it…’\nTo hide his identity, he abolished his dantian and began to create a new one. However, this man just looked at his muscles and figured it out. Chun Yeowun smiled.\n“You should have kept hiding, why bother doing such things?”\nEveryone in the clan disappeared after the death of Blade God, and the reason they never came out for 20 years was that. Of course, now their plans were revealed.\n‘\nI cannot help it.’\nThe man opened his mouth.\n“Demon God… do you know where the son you cherish and the subordinate are?”\nThey were his precious people. Especially his son. He thought if they used the Sky Demon Order’sYoung Lord, maybe they could escape now.\n“…”\nChun Yeowun just frowned. Seeing that, the man thought they had hope!\n‘Done! Now things have changed.’\nThe Demon God’s weakness. Caring for his loved ones.\nFor years they waited for this.\nThen he said,\n“Demon God put me down. If not…”\nAt that moment, Chun Yeowun mumbled.\n“They must be on the Mountain of Dead.”\n“Huh. Your son… what?”\nThe man was perplexed. He had no intention of revealing the location.\n‘… no way!’\nHe was so flustered that he soon lost reasoning but tried to stay calm.\nWell, this was someone anyone could guess, but nothing could be done after that.\n‘Right. Even if he knows, it changes nothing.’\nWhat can he do after knowing?\nThe right to the life of his son and others was in their hands. It would be no exaggeration to say that Chun Yeowun was now in their hands.\n“Huh! Nothing changes just because you know. Your son’s life is… haha!”\nPak!\nBefore he could finish speaking, the man’s body fell to the ground and was caught by Chun Yeowun.\n“W-what are you doing?”\nHe grabbed the man’s head and said,\n“I have no use of you.”\n“What? W-what I said….”\nCrush!\nThe head was smashed, and the face of the Crown Prince witnessing it turned pale again. His son was a hostage, and yet this man was acting boldly.\n‘I-is he crazy? Is it fine for his son to die?’\nChun Yeowun said to him.\n“I’ll be back soon.”\nShhh!\nThen Chun Yeowun’s form disappeared.\nThud!\n“\nKuak!\n”\nThe Crown Prince floating in the room fell down as he was in pain with the broken limbs. But he was more concerned about what he heard.\n‘Be back soon?’\nIn the Mountain of Dead, Yokai Energy was raging around. The place had strange beast screams raging. It was difficult to count the number of corpses.\nSharp and massive blue eyes from the mist as if a small mountain moved. The blue eyes were staring at them.\nThe white-haired man said, opening his arms.\n“He is the King of the Dead. Worship him.”\n“Enough bullshit!”\nHu Bong, who was at a loss of words, shouted. The only person he would worship was Chun Yeowun.\n“The spirit of the Demon God’s subordinate. Indeed, there’s no way you would kneel.”\nShhh!\nThe white-haired man moved his hand, and the three people trapped in the ice fell ahead.\nThud!\n“\nKuak!\n”\n“\nAck!\n”\nThey were being forced.\n— Kukukuku~\nThere was laughter that could be heard in the whole area. It was so loud that it sounded like it came from that monster.\nHu Bong bit his tongue.\n‘Where did they find this monster?’\nHe, too, had experienced going along Chun Yeowun, so he saw the Five Spirit Beasts, which were difficult to see alive, but this was his first time seeing this strange monster. The white-haired man spoke with pride.\n“You will enjoy unprecedented glory. Worship the King of the Dead. Death fades the presence of the one, and eternal life can be shared by all.”\n“\nKkkkkkk!\n”\n“\nAkkkkk!\n”\nThe ghouls raised their hands and cheered. It seemed like they would follow the white-haired man.\n“Eternal life? What nonsense.”\nEven after falling down, Chun Woo-myung didn’t lose his spirit.\nHe was the son of Demon God. He wouldn’t die down in a crisis.\nThud!\n“\nKuak!\n”\nAt that moment, someone grabbed him by the head and threw him down. As his body was trapped in the ice, he couldn’t move but suffer.\n“Young Lord!”\n“You bastards!”\nHu Bong and Wang-suk were angry at it. In particular, Wang-suk was so enraged that even the ice Hu Bong couldn’t break was slowly breaking.\n“What power.”\nBut the white-haired man turned it thicker as it didn’t break at all.\nAn unknown ghoul near Chun Woo-myung laughed.\n“Ke… kekeke…”\nIt seemed like some ego was left in him. He lifted the head of Chun Woo-myung.\nSsss!\nBlood dripped from his face. Yet Chun Woo-myung didn’t groan in pain, and the white-haired guy narrowed his eyes as he looked at it.\n“The baby of a tiger is still a tiger. Look at him, not discouraged even in this situation. But how long will that be? Will you be the same even if your father dies?”\nGrunt!\nAt that, Chun Woo-myung grunted his teeth.\n“Don’t talk recklessly about my father!”\n“Such a loyal man to his father.”\n“Don’t make a joke. What could you rat bastards even do? You had to hold us to even go face him.”\n“… shut up!”\nBang! Bang!\nHolding Chun Woo-myung’s head, the living corpse banged him several times. It should have made him groan, but he didn’t, making the white-haired man think.\n‘Look at him.’\nThis type of human is not afraid of pain. The white-haired man signaled to stop. Which made the dead ask.\n“…can… kill… why… being… stop…ed?”\n“I understand your feelings but hold back. Soon, we can get our revenge.”\n“\nGrrrrr!\n”\nAt the words of the ghoul, he growled, and he removed his hand. Chun Woo-myung’s face was a mess, and he spat out a broken tooth.\nHe looked at the man and said in a cold voice,\n“You will regret it.”\nWhich made the white-haired man smirk.\n“Huh. You have such a strong faith in your father.”\nShhh!\nThen he leaned closer as he said,\n“That will soon collapse. And you will beg like a dog.”\n“Funny.”\n“Let me tell you this. There is no need for the King of the Dead to come. No matter how great your father is, he is nothing compared to the historical murim warriors.”\n“Historical murim warriors?”\nChun Woo-myung frowned.\n“Your father is a child in front of the legends of Murim. Huhu.”\nThe white-haired man stood up and beckoned as he walked.\nThen, he brought someone back.\n“Brother Yun!”\nIt was Yun ja-seo.\n“\nKuaaak!\n”\nYun Ja-seo was heavily bleeding with one arm cut off. Looking at the concerned Chun Woo-myung, the white-haired man asked,\n“What are you doing?”\n“It seemed like you had built some bond within the few days you were together.”\n“Don’t touch him!”\nChun Wo-myung warned him, but those things never worked. The white-haired man enjoyed his reaction and spoke loudly.\n“King! I will make the sacrifice here. I beg you to accept this sacrifice and grant me something.”\nKikiki!\nEerie laughter was heard all around. It felt like something would happen, and the white-haired man said.\n“Watch the King’s favor.”\nWooong!\nA huge shadow was about to move in the air.\nIt was then.\nBang!\nA huge roar ran out at the same time. The shadow existence presumed to be the King of Dead that stood tall like a mountain was easily pushed.\nThud! Thud! Thud!\nEach time it moved, the land shook. The middle-aged man didn’t understand what was happening.\n“King?”\nIt was then.\nSwish!\nSomething landed right in the middle.\n‘!?’\nThere was a black robe fluttering. And the wind rose, making the fog rise as well.\nWheik!\nAnd as the thick fog was lifted, everyone shouted.\n“Father!”\n“Lord!”\n“Lord!”\nIt was none other than Chun Yeowun who landed there. The eyes of the white-haired man and the unusual-looking living corpse turned to him simultaneously.\n“Demon God!”\nThey didn’t expect him to come here. The man bit his lip.\n“Ha! To enter the tiger’s den with your own feet! Hit him.”\nAt his cry, the ghouls around tried to attack him.\n“\nKuak!\n”\n“\nGrrrr!\n”\n“\nAckkk!\n”\nChun Yeowun took one step ahead, and all the ghouls within a 10-meter radius bounced back as they scattered into ashes.\n‘!!!’\nNothing was left behind. They entirely just disappeared. At that, the white-haired man shouted.\n“Huh! Ghouls! All rise and kill him!”\nAnd once again, those dead beings ran to Chun Yeowun.\nDudud!\nAt first glance, they seemed like hundreds or thousands. It was hard to imagine just how such a number of corpses were found.\n“Taste the horrors of the dead! Demon God!”\nChun Yeowun mumbled\n“Just corpses…”\nThe Golden Gumiho who was on the shoulder smiled.\n“How about we show the right kind of it? Chun Ma.”\n“Hmm.”\nChun Yeowun, who had an annoyed look, took a step ahead, and something shocking happened.\nGloomy energy spread around from the floor, and everything turned white.\nShhh!\nSomething came up from the changed ground, like a spirit, but not too.\nShhh!\nAn uncountable number of ghosts appeared, leaving behind white particles as they moved up. The white-haired man who saw it mumbled,\n‘W-what is all that?’\nThis was more terrifying than the ghouls. As the white-haired man froze in shock, Chun Yeowun commanded the ghosts.\n“Feast.”\nAnd with that, all the ghosts flew at once.",

      "content": "Chapter 242: Side Story (9)\nShhhh!\nThe Ghosts were moving as they left behind a trail of white particles everywhere.\n‘Witchery. It has to be witchery.’\nThe white-haired middle-aged man couldn’t believe what he was seeing. Of course, considering that he was using the dead people, bringing in ghosts isn’t such a huge deal, but it made no sense.\n“Kill him!”\nAnything which can be seen with human eyes can be killed, or\nso\nhe thought.\nHowever….\nJjkkk!\n“\nKuak…\n”\nWhenever the ghosts passed by the ghouls, they would stop moving and have their bodies turned white as if any life in them was cut off.\n‘!!!’\nIt’s beyond human understanding.\nThe ghouls\nare\ndead, so they could move however they want to, but for them to stop moving like this…\n‘The ghouls are of no match to him...’\nThis situation was the worst.\nHe was trying to aim to take down the Sky Demon Order with the army of the dead. But now, that army of his seemed like they would be eradicated at any moment now.\nStep! Step!\nIn the midst of all that, Chun Yeowun slowly walked to them.\n‘Damn it.’\nThe eyes of the white-haired man looked at Chun Yeowun and then at Chun Woo-myung, Hu Bong, and KO Wang-suk, who were trapped in ice.\nIf the Ghouls couldn’t handle him, then the white-haired man had to figure something out to deal with him.\nIt was then…\nPhat!\nSomeone gently landed next to him. A man with dark brown hair, blue eyes, and weird lines like tattoos on his face.\nAnd the white-haired man bowed.\n“King.”\nUnexpectedly,\nthis\none was called the\nKing\n, and the blue-eyed man asked.\n“Who is that man?”\n“Huh?”\n“Is he really a human?”\nThe white-haired man was confused. The King of Dead, the greatest monster of all times, was awakened. He resurrected from the dead and an entity that could slaughter all but now seemed vigilant against a human.\n“… he is a human. Just a monster called a\nliving legend\namong humans.”\nHe hated Chun Yeowun, yet he couldn’t deny the difference between the power.\n“Monster…. He deserves to be called that because there is no one other than sages who managed to push me.”\n“You cannot be careless with him. Please help us.”\nAt the request of the white-haired man, the King of Dead looked around. Unlike the usual ghouls, these ones had weapons in their hands. They all seemed to have an ego in them.\n“Are you using these ones like this?”\n“This way, the king wouldn’t have to dirty his hands.”\n“Fine.”\nThe King of Dead raised his hand, then blue energy flowed from him and seeped into the ghouls who were standing. All of them had a blue light flashing from their eyes.\n“\nGrrrr….\n”\nStep!\nThey took a step ahead as if they knew they were revived. At that, the white-haired man smiled.\n‘It was troubling. However, I need the power of the King of the Dead to control them.’\nThe ghouls weren’t the members of their clan. Even if they had an ego, they wouldn’t have followed this man.\n‘The strong people who once dominated Murim.’\nThat was the identity of the ghouls, which had blue eyes. They were the ones who were resurrected to deal with\nthe\nmonster which defeated the Blade God.\nThey were the absolute strong people in Murim who were acknowledged\nas\nstrong by the Blade God.\n‘Hwang-heol objected to this plan. But soon, I will get revenge.’\nThis plan was opposed by all the people in the clan except for him. And if he succeeds, then they could rebuild their clan once again.\n[One of the Three Yokai? Do you think you can control them?]\nTheir objections still rose in his ears. However, even at the cost of making sacrifices, he wanted to make this happen.\nPhat!\nOne of the ghouls moved first.\n“Oh.”\nThe King of Dead seemed interested in it.\nThe ghoul disappeared instantly and suddenly appeared in front of Chun Yeowun. It was a shocking speed.\n‘We can test it.’\nThe white-haired man watched his movements, and the ghoul slashed right away.\n‘As expected!’\nThe identity of one of these ghouls was the 2nd Sect Leader of a famous perished clan. According to the legend, this man was so quick with his movements and swordsmanship that he was called Invincible, and no one ever managed to block his 3-second-strike.\n‘Even if he knows, he won’t be able to respond.’\nIt was then.\nChak!\nThe movement of the swordsman stopped instantly with the sound of a sword slashing. The ghoul's body with the sword was split right in half before the sword was brought down. The white-haired man’s eyes widen in shock.\n‘Huh?’\nChun Yeowun wasn’t even pulling out his sword, yet the body was cut. The ghoul, cut in half, also seemed flustered at what happened and yet still tried to bring down the blade. It was because ghouls feel no pain.\nHowever,\n“Get lost.”\nPak!\nThe moment Chun Yeowun took one step ahead.\nShhh!\nThe Ghoul turned to ashes.\n“Right! As expected of my Lord!”\nHu Bong screamed excitedly at it despite being unable to move from the ice. The white-haired man just bit his lip.\n‘Kuk.’\nHe didn’t think that this monster, who defeated the Blade God, would be pushed back by this Ghoul, but he thought at least there would be a battle for a couple minutes. But this…this was absurd!\n“King. Send that person over there.”\nThe white-haired man pointed to someone. A bald man with rosary beads. The King of Dead clicked his tongue and held out the hand, then…\nThe bald-head man moved ahead and swung at Chun Yeowun.\nIt was the Shaolin Sect’s Leader. However, this man wasn’t just a member but had a strong entity in him, and his fist suddenly reached Chun Yeowun’s face.\n“\nHo.\n”\nHe wasn’t just a Martial Artist but one who was at the Divine Master level. Chun Yeowun held out his hand and blocked it.\nPapapak!\nAn invisible palm extended from Chun Yeowun's hand, and the force of the fist made everything around blowback, except for Chun Yeowun. Meanwhile, the bald ghoul got up once again to attack.\nPapapak!\nIt was the essence of the Shaolin temple, the Power Kick.\n‘One of the three legendary people of Shaolin temple, Yuk Gyeong.’\nHe was a man known for his power and competence, comparable to the Dharma Preacher. Among the Ghouls, the ones of the Shaolin were the most difficult to find. This was because most of them were cremated and were kept as relics in their temple. However, this man had violated the principle of Shaolin and committed murders, so he didn’t get the same treatment.\n‘A monstrous old man who wasn’t recognized for his work.’\nThe members of the Shaolin Temple are usually given lower fame because they prioritize peace. But this man was strong.\n‘This man can surely take down the monster….’\nPhang!\nThe Ghoul bounced back. And Chun Yeowun, who used his palm to defend, used his left hand and motioned like he was pushing something.\nPaaang!\nAt that moment, the wind rose in their direction. And the body of the Ghoul, which was being swept back, moved further back by the force of the wind and turned to ashes.\nOnce again, the white-haired man widened his eyes in disbelief.\n‘Even the legendary Shaolin warriors couldn’t last for a second?’\n“How long will you deal with him like this?”\n“Huh?”\nThe King of the Dead waved his hand. A blue light arose, and everyone waiting there rushed at Chun Yeowun.\nPapapa!\nThere were around forty warriors. Only this had to be done to win.\nThen, Chun Yeowun opened his mouth.\n“Woo-myung.”\nHe spoke in a soft voice, but it was enough for everyone to hear.\n“Father!”\n‘What was that?’\nThe white-haired man was alarmed at Chun Yeowun calling his son in the middle of a fight.\nChun Yeowun continued.\n“This is a technique I never showed you.”\n“Technique?”\nEveryone was puzzled. At that moment, Chun Yeowun raised his left hand.\n“Learn this.”\nAt his father’s words, Chun Woo-myung nodded with a stern expression.\nShhh!\nAt that moment, tons of Invisible Swords that looked like faint black rays of light were created in the air. The number of swords was so many despite all of them having the same amount of force.\nThe white-haired man couldn’t help but be shocked at this sight. Many of his subordinates and men failed to escape from this one thing!\n“Sky… Sky Flash.”\nThe technique that made Chun Yeowun be known as\nthe\nDemon God.\nChun Yeowun then lowered his hand.\nAnd…\nPapapapak!\nBlack rays of light poured down like rain from the air. The power of the Sky Flash right now couldn’t be compared to the past.\nKwakwakwang!\nAnd the swords kept falling down as if they were angry. The legendary warriors who once dominated the world were hit and eradicated simultaneously.\n“This… this…”\nThe white-haired man couldn’t hold his shock. This was far more than what he imagined Chun Yeowun could do. At that time, a Ghoul moved to Chun Yeowun from the side.\nWhong!\nDespite having the eyes of the dead, he shouted.\n“Kill… that… man….”\nBag!\nBefore he could even reach Chun Yeowun, an Invisible Sword hit him.\n“What did it say?”\nIt wasn’t even worth thinking about. Although the Blade God Six Martial clan was unable to compete in the past, they had a chance, but now they felt like inferior bugs in front of him.\n‘T… that monster!’\nThe white-haired man looked at Chun Yeowun with a distorted expression. Chun Yeowun was leisurely walking with his hands on his back. It was terrifying to see him like that.\nBang! Bang!\nThe Sky Flash kept falling around.\nSwosh!\n“\nKuak!\n”\nIt fell to the Blade God Six Martial clan members who were resurrected and to the white-haired man as well.\nChun Yeowun was going to kill everyone here. The Ghouls, which had egos, were scared.\nHowever…\nBang! Bang!\nOnce the Sky Flash was initiated, getting away from it was impossible as they were all aimed at the targets with the help of Nano.\n“Damn it!”\nWhoong!\nThe white-haired man used Ice Qi on the Invisible Sword and tried to block the sword, but the moment he blocked it…\n‘N-No way!’\nPach-chik!\n“Kuak!”\nPapapak!\nHis sword shattered like a piece of glass, and he was thrown out.\nChun Woo-myung, who saw the scene with bewildered eyes, mumbled.\n“You… want me to learn this?”\nHe wasn’t sure how this could be learned.\nAngel’s Corner\nPfftt.. This is so nothing to Chun Yeowun. ?? He’s just leisurely walking there using his powers and showing his son a technique he should learn.",

      "content": "Chapter 243: Side Story (10)\n“\nCough!\n”\nA handful of blood came out of the white-haired man’s mouth. He couldn’t stop the Sky Flash that went for him and suffered internal injuries.\nHowever, he had regenerative power as he took the blood of the Great Bird.\n“\nKuak!\n”\nAfter the dead blood inside was drained out, the skin returned to normal. He couldn’t hide his shock. None of the clan’s men he had gathered here were left alive.\n‘Damn it!’\nHe never imagined that Demon God was this strong. Now, there were only a couple of things left to do.\n‘Chun Woo-myung! I need to get him.’\nThere was no other way to stop the monster from running unless that was done. But, while he was wounded, Chun Yeowun appeared in front of the three trapped in the ice.\n“This is embarrassing, Lord.”\nHu Bong had a guilty expression. It was for not properly taking care of the Young Lord.\n“Don’t mind. What could you have done in this situation?”\n“Lord…”\nIt was a trap that the enemies had planned and prepared. No matter how experienced Hu Bong was, he couldn’t have dealt with this having two kids by his side.\nSo, in preparation for such times, Chun Yeowun implanted a modified nano machine in his son's body to detect any emergency.\nShhh!\nChun Yeowun held out his hand, and the ice melted. Chun Woo-myung got up and bowed his head, then said,\n“Father… Everything is my fault. If I followed the original place, uncle Hu and Wang-suk wouldn’t have had to go through this.”\nAnd he even made his father come all the way here. As a Young Lord of the clan, he was ashamed.\nChun Yeowun just looked at him, who had the face of the child that was admitting his mistake and not showing pain despite having his face all bloody.\n‘This child.’\nTak!\nHe put his hand on his son’s head.\n“There is no perfect man in murim.”\n“Father…”\n“It is important to learn from mistakes and create a new version of yourself.”\nChun Yeowun, too, made several mistakes when he was young, and based on those, he learned where he was today.\n“… I will keep it in mind!”\nAfter his son’s reply, he slowly touched his son’s face.\nShh!\nWhen Chun Yeowun reached his son’s face, the bloodstains were cleaned, and the wounds were healed. As the pain, too, disappeared, Chun Woo-myung exhaled.\n‘Ah… my father….’\nThis omnipotent being was his father. And he healed his wounds.\n“Ah! Brother Yun!”\nSuddenly, Chun Woo-myung thought of the man who helped him. Looking around, he found Yun Ja-seo lying down.\n“Someone you know?”\nHe nodded at Chun Yeowun’s question, but he didn’t give other details.\nBut the man who was righteous till the end.\n“A colleague.”\n“Yes?”\nChun Yeowun smiled at the worried face of his son and reached out his hand. The body of Yun Ja-seo floated towards him.\n“Uh?”\nChun Yeowun moved him and made him stand easily. Yun Ja-seo looked around, surprised.\n‘This… this is the Demon God.’\nHe was facing the head of the Sky Demon Order he hated so much, the current leader of the Murim. When such a being was in front of him, Yun Ja-seo froze.\n“My son seems to have taken a liking to you.”\nChun Yeowun touched the severed right arm and rubbed it. The bleeding on Yun Ja-seo’s right arm stopped, and the internal energy of Chun Yeowun wrapped around the injured areas.\n“Ah!”\nYun Ja-seo felt strange.\nAside from being the enemy who closed down his clan, Chun Yeowun had an enormous presence. And the expression of the man being overwhelming did suit him better.\n“Brother Yun… I am sorry for hiding my identity.”\nYun Ja-seo didn’t say anything about Chun Woo-myung’s identity. When he found out that they were cursing the Sky Demon Order in front of this group, he felt terrible.\n‘How can this be?’\nChun Woo-myung smiled at the bewildered man and sent telepathy.\n[Don’t worry, brother Yun. I’m bad at keeping secrets!]\n“\nKuak!\n”\nAt that, Yun Ja-seo let out a squeaky laugh. At the same time, he thought that this young man, Chun Woo-myung, was a good person.\nIt was then,\nCreepy!\nWeird energy rose, and everyone turned to it.\n‘!!!’\nKwakwakwang!\nAnd turning into a storm, this weird energy swept to where Chun Yeowun was. It became a massive tornado with blue light that had the momentum to devour Chun Yeowun and those around him.\n“W-we need to avoid it!”\nFrightened, Yun Ja-seo shouted, but no one moved.\n‘W-why?’\nHe couldn’t understand, but it was obvious. The most powerful being was right on their side.\nShh!\nChun Yeowun grabbed the sword and extended it.\nAt that moment,\nChak!\nThe tornado, with energy wanting to destroy everything, disappeared.\nGoooo!\nAnd once the storm was swept, there was a presence—the King of the Dead.\n“W-what energy…”\nYun Ja-seo was at a loss for words. It was hard to breathe because of this eerie energy stimulating all his senses. This wasn’t something a human could possess.\nThe white-haired man who stepped ahead yelled with a happy face.\n“This is just the beginning, Demon God. The fact that this place will become your grave, no matter how much try, once the King comes ahead….”\nTak!\n“Uh?”\nThe white-haired man frowned. It was because he saw what looked like golden fur around Chun Yeowun’s shoulder.\n‘What?’\nLooking closer, it was a fox cub? With\nnine\ntails? He was confused at this unexpected sight.\nEven the King of the Dead was shocked.\n“King?”\n“No way…”\nHe couldn't understand why he was reacting like that to the baby fox.\n— King of the Dead? So funny. Since when did you get called by such a grand name?\n“The fox is speaking?”\nThe white-haired man was confused. This man wasn’t surprised by the dead, Ghosts, or Ghouls, but by a talking fox.\nAnd the King of the Dead…\n“Gumi…”\nThe true identity of the baby fox.\n— Ah, Gumi?\nThe golden fox frowned and jumped ahead. The moment she did it, her whole body was dyed in gold.\nWooong!\nThe golden fox dyed in golden light suddenly turned into a blonde woman. Yun Ja-seo, who knew nothing about this, and the white-haired man were shocked.\n“Aunt Miho!”\nThe Golden Gumiho went right for the cheeks of Chun Woo-myung.\n“Ugh. My cute cute Woo-myung!”\n“Th… this… let… go….”\nChun Woo-myung felt embarrassed at how she was treating him as a child. However, knowing her nature, he could do nothing.\n“My cute Woo-myung was tormented. Ugh.”\nAnd while trying to soothe the child, she looked at the King of the Dead.\n“Yah!”\nThe King of Dead had a tensed face hearing her scream. The arrogance he had moments ago disappeared.\nGumi warned.\n“I will count from three to one. If you don’t kneel before me right then, you die.”\nThen she counted.\n“Three!”\nThe white-haired man couldn’t understand what was happening.\n“King, what is happening? Immediately take them….”\n“Two!”\nThe King’s expression distorted in shame. He couldn’t bow while the human who respected him was present, but he thought…\n‘Golden Gumiho.’\nShe was a monster so dangerous that everyone had a hard time with her. She was a Yokai which lived longer than him.\n‘Right. Not old.’\nAs soon as he made up his mind, the King of the Dead reached out his hand. And before she could call out the last number, he gathered his Yokai Energy and fired a blue ray at her.\n“You kneel!”\nWoong!\nIt was so strong that haze could be seen around, and the Golden Gumiho smiled.\nShhh!\nOne of her tails whipped it and slashed the beam.\nBang!\nThe beam bounced off the mountain and hit another one.\nGrrrr!\nAs if there was a landslide, the mountain could be seen falling. And seeing that, one could know the King of Dead did his best.\nShhh!\n“Uh?”\nBefore the King of Dead could process what just happened, one of Golden Gumiho’s tails spread and tied him up like a rope.\nClench!\nThe King of the Dead raised his energy to get out, but nothing changed. The tail only got tighter and tighter.\nCrack!\n“\nKuaaak!\n”\nUnable to bear the pain, he screamed.\n“W-what power!”\nThe King of the Dead thought it was absurd as her powers seemed stronger compared to the past. He knew that she was sealed like him, and it would take thousands of human hearts to recover, then how could she be this strong now?\n‘I only had a hundred humans till now.’\nIt will take tens of thousands of humans to reach her level. Ignoring that, she only leaned on Chun Yeowun.\n“Did I do well~? He is nothing. He’s just someone who plays with the dead. He’s just a raccoon with a little power.”\n“Raccoon?”\nWoong!\nAnd when she applied more force to the tail, the King of the Dead with blue eyes was dyed in blue light and changed.\nHe became a raccoon with a belly that was twice the size of a normal one.\n“\nKuaaak.\n”\nThe raccoon seemed to be in pain.\nThe white-haired man was disappointed. Who could have imagined the true form of the monster is a raccoon?\n‘How can this….’\nAll the plans he built in his mind turned insane. No matter what he did, Chun Yeowun was higher.\n“Oye.”\nHe heard a muffled voice from behind. He couldn’t turn. He knew who it was without turning.\n“Demon… God.”\n“Are the other ones alright? Hwang-heol, was it?”\nAt Chun Yeowuns’s question, the white-haired man was shocked. He didn’t think one of them would be mentioned by Chun Yeowun.\nHe couldn’t respond.\nCrack!\n“\nKuak!\n”\nChun Yeowun pierced his chest and grabbed his heart. Gloomy and chilling energy ran through his heart and spread throughout his body.\nJjkkk!\nThe white-haired man’s body lost its life as if it was frozen. The white-haired man who was shaking his head fell with a groan.\nAnd something rose from the body.\nShhh!\nAnd with that, Chun Yewun smiled.\n“Father, is that fine?”\nChun Woo-myung asked, wondering. He didn’t like the idea of stopping his trip and coming back because of the incident. Chun Yeowun allowed him to continue.\n“Hu Bong. Take care of him.”\n“Yes! Lord. Hehe, I will look after the Young Lord.”\nHu Bong smiled at Chun Woo-myung, who couldn’t hide his feelings. Actually, Hu Bong knew it would be like this.\nEven if Chun Yeowun was a father, he was the Lord of the Sky Demon Order. And lions never raise their young ones to be weak.\nKo Wang-suk spoke with a bitter expression.\n“Lord… I don’t think I have the right to serve the Young Lord. Please choose a more suitable person to take care of him instead of me.”\nThose were unexpected words coming from her, making Chun Woo-myung and Hu Bong look at her with puzzled eyes.\n“Uh?”\n“I am lacking.”\nIt felt like she had lost confidence in the face of an overwhelming enemy she had met for the first time.\nDespite being afraid of her, Chun Woo-myung felt sorry and tried to comfort her, but…\n‘No. This might be better.’\nThis was better than dreading her presence every night. But Chun Yeowun was patting her on the shoulders and comforting her.\n“This is also an experience. Have more confidence. Aren’t you the daughter of Ko Wanghur and Hou Sang-hwa, who are famous for their strength?”\n“L-Lord…”\nShe seemed shocked.\n“Take care of my son.”\nWith that, her face turned red enough to explode. She turned with sparkling eyes and looked at Chun Woo-myung.\n“You entrusted your son to me. What am I supposed—-”\nChun Woo-myung shouted at it.\n“He didn’t mean it like that!!!”\nWell…thanks to that, the atmosphere of the group went back to normal.\nChun Woo-myung asked his father.\n“Are you going back to the clan right away?”\n“Well, there is a place I need to stop by, but I will be back. And there is a new toy too.”\nChun Yeowun looked at the raccoon caught in Golden Gumiho’s tail.\nThe raccoon yelled,\n“This! How dare a human call me a toy….”\nChun Yeowun clenched his finger near the raccoon’s head.\nKwang!\n“\nKuak!\n”\nOne hit.\nJust one hit was enough to make the King of the Dead scream and faint.\n“He will have to be discipled.”\nChun Yeowun shook his head.\n“See you later,”\nChun Yeowun said with a very gentle voice.\nAnd the fox, too, greeted.\n“My Woo-myung, let’s meet later.”\nShhh!\nAnd with the same shaking, they disappeared.\nAt this time, he seemed more like a God than a father. Chun Woo-myung smiled, looking at where his father vanished, then he asked Yun Ja-seo,\n“Brother Yun. If it is fine, will you join us?”\nAt that, he responded.\n“How can I say two things with a single mouth? The remaining colleagues of mine are… down. I will help you.”\nIt was an unexpected decision. The other colleagues either died here or turned to ghouls, so he had no reason to refuse when asked.\n“It is nice to be with you.”\n“Brother Chun!”\nGrab!\nYun Ja-seo smiled and shook hands with him. No one in this place knew that their relationship would be so strong that Yun Ja-seo would be the right arm of the 25th Lord, Chun Woo-myung.\nThe residence of the Crown Prince.\nWith his arms and legs weirdly broken, the Crown Prince crawled to get out of the room.\n“\nKuaak\n… father… father… I need to tell him….”\nHe thought the only one to save him would be the emperor. Today, this room was spacious to the extent that he hated it.\nThen he tried to reach the door.\n‘Little more… a little more….’\nShhh!\nBut a black shadow appeared in front, and as he looked at it, his face turned paler.\n“Lo… Lord.”\nChun Yeowun was standing there. And with a smile, he asked.\n“Did I take too long?”",

      "content": "Chapter 244: Epilogue\nAngel:\nThis is it, guys. ?? A very short last chapter.\nLate at night at the Hundred Thousand Mountains, a middle-aged-looking man that has half of the amount of his hair turned white was acting like a horse and making a pretty five-year-old girl smile.\n“\nGrrrr!\n”\nThe child continued to smile and laugh at it. The middle-aged man who saw it smiled brightly. This man was Chun Yujong, the father of Chun Yeowun.\n“Grandfather, I feel dizzy.”\nAfter playing like this for quite a while, Chun Yujong looked at the girl and put her down quickly.\n“Ryang, are you okay?”\nThe girl’s name was Chun Hye-ryang. She was the daughter of Chun Yeowun’s second wife, Wang Yeo-gun.\n“I am dizzy.”\nAt Hye-ryang’s words, Chun Yujong mildly scolded her.\n“Isnt that why grandfather told you to slow down? Look at you.”\n“\nIng..\n.”\nEven if he was scolding her like that, she was a child he cherished, and it was obvious just by how gentle his eyes looked at her.\nAt that moment, a servant spoke from outside.\n“Former Lord. The Lord has come.”\n“He is here? Let him in.”\n“Yes.”\nHye-ryang looked at Chun Yujong’s face and asked,\n“Why does grandfather make such a face when talking about my dad?”\nAt Hye-ryang’s question, Chun Yujong frowned. Did this child just look into his eyes?\nChun Yujong smiled softly.\n“It is because grandfather is sorry to your father.”\n“Why?”\nHye-ryang tilted her head. Chun Yujong stroked her head.\nTap!\nThe door opened, and Chun Yeowun entered.\n“Daddy!”\nHye-ryang ran into Chun Yeowun, who held her. Chun Yeowun embraced her like a daughter’s fool.\n“My Ryang, did you have a good time with grandfather?”\n“Uhuh! Grandfather read me a book and rode a horse too! Grandfather plays better than dad!”\nHye-ryang proudly said it. She was a child who really loved Chun Yujong.\n“That is nice. But now it is late, and grandfather needs to rest for tomorrow.”\n“Uh. I want to play more.”\nChun Yeowun stroked her head and said,\n“Great Guardian.”\nShhh!\nBehind him appeared a man with a unique mask, Marakum.\n“\nTch.\n”\nSeeing Marakum, Hye-ryang snorted as she cutely put her hands on her waist. It was an act to show that she didn’t like this. Marakum, who looked at her cute reaction, smiled.\n“Miss. It is time~.”\n“No! I don't want to! I want to play more with my grandfather.”\nTak!\n“\nKyak!\n”\nMarakum lifted her and put her on his shoulders. Then Hye-ryang, who was pouting earlier, began to squeak at it. She was a child who really liked horses.\n“I will take her to the room.”\n“Please.”\n“I will leave. Miss..\nwoong!\n”\n“\nKrrrrr!\n”\nMarakum was now accustomed to dealing with children. Chun Yujong and Chun Yeowun looked at him, leaving.\nAfter the two left, the room fell quiet. It was Chun Yeowun who broke the silence.\nShhh!\nHe reached for something in the shadows and pulled out something, and they were a wine bottle and two glasses.\nThen he asked his father,\n“Would you like a drink with me?”\n“… sounds like a good idea.”\nChun Yujong answered awkwardly. Chun Yeowun just bluntly put down the bottle and glasses on the table. The drinking, which started then, continued all night.\nA smile bloomed on the faces of the two men who were silently giving and receiving glasses.\nThis is the last chapter of Descent of the Demon God. This is the first novel we translated from start to finish, and we're very happy with it. Big thanks to all of our supporters and readers, who made this possible, to our wonderful staff—especially our translator.",
